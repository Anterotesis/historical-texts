<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>TO avoid di&s;ea&s;es, it is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould know their cau&s;es. The&s;e indeed are numerous; but we &s;hall endeavour to point out &s;uch only as have the mo&s;t general influence, as too great minute|ne&s;s in this re&s;pect would tend rather to perplex than in|&s;truct the generality of readers.</P>
<P>THE better to trace di&s;ea&s;es from their original cau&s;es, we &s;hall take a view of the common treatment of mankind in the &s;tate of infancy. In this period of our lives, the foundations of a good or bad con&s;titution are generally laid; it is therefore of importance, that parents be well ac|quainted with the various cau&s;es which may produce di&s;|ea&s;es in their offspring. It mu&s;t be owing either to the ig|norance or carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of parents, that &s;o many of the hu|man &s;pecies peri&s;h in infancy. This, we pre&s;ume, will appear from the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>THE annual regi&s;ters of the dead &s;hew, that at lea&s;t one half of the children born in Great Britain die under twelve years of age. To tho&s;e who do not reflect, this appears to be a natural evil, and therefore they think it their duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;ubmit to it. But whoever accurately examines the mat|ter, will find that it is an evil of our own making, and, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to mi&s;management. Were the death of infants a natural evil, other animals &s;hould be as liable to die young as man; but that we &s;ee is not the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>IT may &s;eem &s;trange, that man, notwith&s;tanding his &s;uperior rea&s;on, &s;hould fall &s;o far &s;hort of other animals
<PB N="2" REF="012338_0006_0F88EA96F8D18C28">
in the management of his young: But our &s;urpri&s;e will &s;oon cea&s;e, if we con&s;ider that brutes, guided by in&s;tinct, never err in this re&s;pect; while man, tru&s;ting &s;olely to art, is &s;eldom right. Were a catalogue of tho&s;e children who peri&s;h annually by art alone, exhibited to public view, it would a&s;toni&s;h mo&s;t people.</P>
<P>WHEN parents are above taking care of their children, others mu&s;t be employed for that purpo&s;e: The&s;e will al|ways endeavour to recommend them&s;elves by the appear|ance of extraordinary &s;kill and addre&s;s. By this means &s;o many unnece&s;&s;ary and de&s;tructive articles have been intro|duced into the diet, cloathing, &amp;c. of children, that it is no wonder &s;o many of them peri&s;h.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more prepo&s;terous than for a mother to think it below her to take care of her own child, or to be &s;o ignorant as not to know what is proper to be done for it. If we &s;earch nature throughout, we cannot find a parallel to this. Every other creature is the nur&s;e of its own young, and they thrive accordingly. Were the brutes to bring up their young by proxy, they would &s;hare the &s;ame fate with tho&s;e of the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P>WE mean not to impo&s;e it as a ta&s;k upon every mother to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ckle her own child. This, whatever &s;peculative writers may &s;ay to the contrary, is in many ca&s;es imprac|ticable, and would inevitably prove de&s;tructive both to the mother and child. Women of delicate con&s;titutions, &s;ub|ject to low &s;pirits, hy&s;teric fits, or other nervous di&s;orders, make very bad nur&s;es: But the&s;e complaints are now &s;o common, that it is rare to find a woman of fa&s;hion free from them; for which cau&s;e few women of better &s;tation, &s;uppo&s;e them willing, are really able to &s;uckle their own children.</P>
<P>DID mankind live as nature directs, almo&s;t every mother would be in a condition to give &s;uck: But, whoever con|&s;iders how far we have deviated from her dictates, will not be &s;urpri&s;ed to find many of them unable to perform that nece&s;&s;ary office. Mothers, who do not eat enough of &s;olid food, nor enjoy the benefit of free air and exerci&s;e, can neither have whole&s;ome humours them&s;elves, nor afford proper nouri&s;hment to an infant. Children who are &s;uck|led by delicate women, either die young, or are weak and &s;ickly all their lives. Nor is this at all to be wondered at. If children &s;uck in nervous di&s;ea&s;es with their mother's milk, What have we to expect?</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="012338_0007_0F88EA97AF151DA8">
WHEN we &s;ay, that every mother is not able to &s;uckle her own child, we would not be under&s;tood as di&s;couraging that practice. Every mother who can, ought certainly to perform that tender office. But &s;uppo&s;e it to be out of her power, &s;he may, neverthele&s;s, be of great &s;ervice to her child. The bu&s;ine&s;s of nur&s;ing is by no means con|fined to giving &s;uck. To a woman who abounds with milk, that is the ea&s;ie&s;t part of it. Numberle&s;s other offices are nece&s;&s;ary for a child, which the mother at lea&s;t ought to &s;ee done. A mother, who abandons the fruit of her womb, as &s;oon as it is born, to the &s;ole care of an hireling, hardly de&s;erves that name. A child, by being brought up under the mother's eye, not only &s;ecures her affection, but may reap all the advantages of a mother's care, though it be &s;uckled by another. How can a mother be better em|ployed, than in &s;uperintending the nur&s;ery? This is at once the mo&s;t delightful and important office! yet the mo&s;t trivial bu&s;ine&s;s or in&s;ipid amu&s;ements are often preferred to it. A &s;trong proof both of the bad ta&s;te and wrong edu|cation of modern females.</P>
<P>IT is much to be regretted, that more pains is not be|&s;towed in teaching the proper management of children to tho&s;e whom nature has de&s;igned for mothers. This, in|&s;tead of being made the principal, is &s;eldom con&s;idered as any part of female education. Is it any wonder, when females, &s;o educated, come to be mothers, that they &s;hould be quite ignorant of the duties belonging to that &s;tation? However &s;trange it may &s;eem, it is certainly true, that many mothers, and tho&s;e of fa&s;hion too, are as ignorant, when they have brought a child into the world, of what is proper to be done for it, as the infant it&s;elf. Indeed, the mo&s;t ignorant part of the &s;ex are generally reckoned mo&s;t knowing in the bu&s;ine&s;s of nur&s;ing. Hence, &s;en&s;ible people become the dupes of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition; and the nur&s;ing of children, in&s;tead of being conducted by rea&s;on, is the re&s;ult of whim and caprice.</P>
<P>ONE great de&s;ign of females, no doubt, is to propagate the &s;pecies. But to bring forth a child, is the lea&s;t part of that important bu&s;ine&s;s. Were the care of a parent to &s;top here, the whole human race would &s;oon be extinct. Na|ture has made it nece&s;&s;ary, that a child &s;hould depend on its parents during the &s;tate of infancy; and tho&s;e parents who neglect the proper care of their offspring, not only violate one of the fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t principles of nature,
<PB N="4" REF="012338_0008_0F88EA98A58A2738">
but actually endeavour to extingui&s;h the human race. An infant may be as certainly murdered by neglect, as by any act of violence whatever; and, for one child that lo&s;es its life by the latter, a thou&s;and peri&s;h by the former, without being regarded.</P>
<P>WERE the time that is generally &s;pent by females in ac|quiring u&s;ele&s;s knowledge, employed in learning how to bring up their children; how to dre&s;s them &s;o as not to hurt, cramp, or confine their motions; how to feed them with whole&s;ome and nouri&s;hing food; how to exerci&s;e their tender bodies, &s;o as be&s;t to promote their growth and &s;trength: Were the&s;e the objects of female in&s;truction, mankind would derive the greate&s;t advantage from it. But, while the education of females implies little more than what relates to dre&s;s and public &s;how, we have nothing to ex|pect from them but ignorance, even in the mo&s;t important concerns. But ignorance can be no excu&s;e, where people have it in their power to be better informed; and, if chil|dren peri&s;h by the negligence of mothers, they mu&s;t be accountable.</P>
<P>DID mothers know their importance, and lay it to heart, they would embrace every opportunity of informing them|&s;elves of the duties which they owe to their infant-offspring. It is theirs, not only to form the body, but al&s;o to give the mind its mo&s;t early ca&s;t. They have it very much in their power to make men healthy or valetudinary, u&s;eful in life, or the bane of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BUT the mother is not the only per&s;on concerned in the management of children. The father has an equal intere&s;t in their welfare, and ought to a&s;&s;i&s;t in every thing that re|&s;pects either the improvement of the body or mind.</P>
<P>IT is pity that men pay &s;o little regard to this matter. Their neglect is one rea&s;on why females know &s;o little of it. Women will ever be de&s;irous to excel in &s;uch accom|pli&s;hments as recommend them to the other &s;ex. But men generally keep at &s;uch a di&s;tance from even the &s;malle&s;t ac|quaintance with the affairs of the nur&s;ery, that many would e&s;teem it an affront, were they &s;uppo&s;ed to know any thing of it. Not &s;o, however, with the kennel or the &s;tables: A gentleman of the fir&s;t rank is not a&s;hamed to give di|rections concerning the management of his dogs or hor&s;es; but would blu&s;h, were he to be &s;urprized in performing the &s;ame office for that being, who derived its exi&s;tence from him&s;elf, who is the heir of his fortunes, and the future hope
<PB N="5" REF="012338_0009_0F88EA9A43C0A9B0">
of his country. Few fathers indeed run any hazard of being &s;urprized in this &s;ituation; yet, certain it is, that man needs culture more than any other creature, and that both his body and mind are capable of the greate&s;t im|provement. Nature has left &s;o much in the power of pa|rents, that children are, in a great mea&s;ure, what they plea&s;e to make them.</P>
<P>PHYSICIANS them&s;elves have not been &s;ufficiently atten|tive to the management of children: That has been gene|rally con&s;idered as the &s;ole province of old women, while men of the fir&s;t rank in phy&s;ick have even refu&s;ed to vi&s;it infants when &s;ick. Such conduct in the faculty has not only cau&s;ed this branch of medicine to be neglected, but has al&s;o encouraged the other &s;ex to a&s;&s;ume an ab&s;olute title to pre&s;cribe for children in the mo&s;t dangerous di&s;ea&s;es. The con&s;equence is, that a phy&s;ician is &s;eldom called till the good women have exhau&s;ted all their &s;kill; when his attend|ance can only &s;erve to divide the blame and appea&s;e the di&s;|con&s;olate parents.</P>
<P>WE would have nur&s;es do all in their power to prevent di&s;ea&s;es; but, when a child is taken ill, &s;ome per&s;on of &s;kill &s;hould immediately be con&s;ulted. The di&s;ea&s;es of children are generally acute, and the lea&s;t delay is dan|gerous.</P>
<P>WERE phy&s;icians more attentive to the di&s;ea&s;es of chil|dren, they would not only be better qualified to treat them properly when &s;ick, but likewi&s;e to give u&s;eful directions for their management when well. The di&s;ea&s;es of chil|dren is by no means &s;uch a difficult &s;tudy as many imagine. It is true, children cannot tell their complaints; but the cau&s;es of them may be pretty certainly di&s;covered, by put|ting proper que&s;tions to the nur&s;es and &s;uch as are about them. Be&s;ides, the di&s;ea&s;es of infants, being le&s;s compli|cated, are ea&s;ier cured than tho&s;e of adults.</P>
<P>IT is really a&s;toni&s;hing, that &s;o little attention &s;hould in general be paid to the pre&s;ervation of infant-lives! What labour and expence are daily be&s;towed to prop an old rotten carca&s;e for a few years, while thou&s;ands of tho&s;e, who might be u&s;eful in life, peri&s;h without being regarded, and prove no better than an untimely birth! Mankind are apt to value things not according to their future but their pre|&s;ent utility. This is of all others the mo&s;t erroneous me|thod of e&s;timation; yet, upon no other principle is it po&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="6" REF="012338_0010_0F88EA9AACCAFAE0">
to account for the general indifference with re&s;pect to the death of infants.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF DISEASED PARENTS.</HEAD>
<P>DISEASED parents cannot beget healthy children. It would be as rea&s;onable to expect a rich crop from a barren &s;oil, as that &s;trong and healthy children &s;hould be born of delicate parents, worn out with intemperance or di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>AN ingenious writer ob&s;erves *, that on the con&s;titution of mothers depends originally that of their offspring. No one who believes this, will be &s;urpri&s;ed, on a view of the female world, to find di&s;ea&s;es and death &s;o frequent among children. A delicate female, brought up within doors, an utter &s;tranger to exerci&s;e and open air, who lives on tea and other &s;lops, may bring a child into the world, but it will hardly be fit to live. The fir&s;t bla&s;t of a di&s;ea&s;e will nip the tender plant in the bud: Or, &s;hould it &s;truggle through a few years exi&s;tence, its feeble frame, &s;hook with convul|&s;ions from every trivial cau&s;e, would be unable to &s;u&s;tain the common functions of life, and prove a burden to &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P>IF to the delicacy of mothers we add the irregular lives of fathers, we &s;hall &s;ee further cau&s;e to believe, that chil|dren are often hurt by the con&s;titution of their parents. A &s;ickly frame may be originally induced by hard&s;hips or in|temperance, but chiefly by the latter. It is impo&s;&s;ible that a cour&s;e of vice &s;hould not &s;poil the be&s;t con&s;titution: And did the evil terminate here, it would be a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for the folly of the &s;ufferer; but when once a di&s;temper is contracted and rivetted in the habit, it is entailed on all po&s;terity. What a dreadful inheritance is the gout, the &s;curvy, or the kings-evil, to tran&s;mit to our offspring! How happy had it been for the heir of many a great e&s;tate, had he been born a beggar, rather than to inherit his father's fortunes at the expence of likewi&s;e inheriting his di&s;ea&s;es!</P>
<P>NO per&s;on who labours under any incurable malady, ought to marry, as he thereby both &s;hortens his own life, and tran&s;mits mi&s;ery to others: But when both parties are deeply tainted with the &s;crophula, the &s;curvy, or the like, the effects mu&s;t be &s;till wor&s;e. Such will either have no i&s;&s;ue at all, or tho&s;e whom they have, mu&s;t be mi&s;erable in|deed. Want of attention to the&s;e things, in forming con|nections
<PB N="7" REF="012338_0011_0F88EA9D3411D580">
for life, has rooted out more families than the plague, famine, or the &s;word; and while the&s;e connections are formed from mercenary views, that mu&s;t be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>IN our matrimonial contracts, it is amazing &s;o little re|gard is had to the health and form of the object. Our &s;port&s;men know, that the generous cour&s;er cannot be bred out of the foundered jade, nor the &s;agacious &s;paniel out of the &s;narling cur. This is &s;ettled upon immutable laws. The man who marries a woman of a &s;ickly con&s;titution, and de&s;cended of unhealthy parents, whatever his views may be, cannot be &s;aid to act a prudent part. A puny &s;crophulous woman may prove fertile; &s;hould this be the ca&s;e, the family mu&s;t become an infirmary. What pro&s;pect of happine&s;s the father of &s;uch a family has, we &s;hall leave any one to judge.</P>
<P>THE Jews, by the po&s;itive direction of the Almighty, were forbid to have any manner of commerce with the di&s;ea&s;ed; and indeed to this all wi&s;e legi&s;lators ought to have a &s;pecial regard. In &s;ome &s;tates, the marriage of morbid people has actually been prohibited. This is an evil of a complicated kind, a natural deformity, and political mi&s;chief; and therefore requires a public con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>SUCH children as have the misfortune to be born of di&s;|ea&s;ed parents, will require to be nur&s;ed with greater care than others. This is the only way to make amends for the defects of con&s;titution; and it will often go a great length. A healthy nur&s;e, whole&s;ome air, and enough of exerci&s;e, will do wonders. But, when the&s;e are neglect|ed, little is to be expected from any other quarter. The defects of con&s;titution cannot be &s;upplied by medicine.</P>
<P>THOSE who inherit any family-di&s;ea&s;e, ought to be very circum&s;pect in their manner of living. They &s;hould con|&s;ider well the nature of &s;uch di&s;ea&s;e, and guard again&s;t it by a proper regimen. It is certain, that family-di&s;ea&s;es have often, by proper care, been kept off for one genera|tion; and there is great rea&s;on to believe, that, by per&s;i&s;t|ing in the &s;ame cour&s;e, &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es might at length be wholely eradicated. This is a &s;ubject very little regarded, though of the la&s;t importance. Family-con&s;titutions are as capable of improvement, as family-e&s;tates; and the li|bertine, who impairs the one, does greater injury to his po&s;terity, than the prodigal who &s;quanders away the other.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE CLOATHING OF CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>THE cloathing of an infant is &s;o &s;imple a matter, that it is &s;urpri&s;ing, how any per&s;on &s;hould err in it; yet many children lo&s;e their lives, and others are deformed, by errors of this kind.</P>
<P>NATURE knows no other u&s;e of cloaths to an infant, but to keep it warm. All that is nece&s;&s;ary for this pur|po&s;e, is to wrap it in a &s;oft, loo&s;e covering. Were a mo|ther left to the dictates of nature and rea&s;on, this is cer|tainly the method that &s;he would follow. But the bu&s;ine&s;s of dre&s;&s;ing an infant has long been out of the hands of mo|thers, and has at la&s;t become a &s;ecret, which none but adepts pretend to under&s;tand.</P>
<P>FROM the mo&s;t early ages it has been thought nece&s;&s;ary, that a woman in labour &s;hould have &s;ome per&s;on to attend her. This in time became a bu&s;ine&s;s; and, like all others, tho&s;e who were employed in it, &s;trove to outdo one ano|ther in the different branches of their profe&s;&s;ion. The dre&s;&s;ing of a child came of cour&s;e to be con&s;idered as the midwife's province, who no doubt imagined, that the more dexterity &s;he could &s;how in this article, the more her &s;kill would be admired. Her attempts might be &s;econded by the vanity of parents, who wanting to make a &s;how of the in|fant as &s;oon as it was born, were ambitious to have as much finery heaped upon it as po&s;&s;ible. Thus it came to be thought as nece&s;&s;ary for a midwife to excel in bracing and dre&s;&s;ing an infant, as for a &s;urgeon to be expert in applying bandages to a broken limb; and the poor child, as &s;oon as it came into the world, had as many rollers and wrappers applied to its body, as if every bone had been fractured in the birth; while the&s;e were often &s;o tight, as not only to gall and wound its tender frame, but even to ob&s;truct the motion of the heart, lungs, and other organs nece&s;&s;ary for life.</P>
<P>IN &s;everal parts of Britain the practice of rolling chil|dren with &s;o many bandages is now, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, laid a&s;ide; but it would &s;till be a difficult ta&s;k to per&s;uade the generality of women, that the &s;hape of a child does not in|tirely depend on the midwife's care. So far, however, are all their endeavours to mend the &s;hape of children, from being &s;ucce&s;sful, that they con&s;tantly operate the contrary way, and mankind become deformed ju&s;t in proportion to
<PB N="9" REF="012338_0013_0F88EA9E717FDC18">
the means u&s;ed to prevent deformity. How little deformi|ty of body is to be found among uncivilized nations? So little indeed, that it is vulgarly believed they put all their deformed children to death. The truth is, they hardly know &s;uch a thing as a deformed child. Neither &s;hould we, if we followed their example. Savage nations never think of manacling their children. They allow them the full u&s;e of every organ, carry them abroad in the open air, wa&s;h their bodies daily in cold water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By this ma|nagement their children become &s;o &s;trong and hardy, that, by the time our puny infants get out of the nur&s;e's arms, theirs are able to &s;hift for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>AMONG brute animals no art is nece&s;&s;ary to procure a fine &s;hape. Though many of them be extremely delicate, when they come into the world, yet we never find them grow crooked for want of &s;waddling-bands. Is nature le&s;s generous to the human kind? No: But we take the bu&s;ine&s;s out of nature's hands.</P>
<P>NOT only the analogy of other animals, but the very feelings of infants tell us, that they ought to be kept ea&s;y and free from all pre&s;&s;ure. They cannot indeed &s;peak their complaints; but they can &s;hew &s;igns of pain; and this they never fail to do, by crying, when pinched by their cloaths. No &s;ooner are they freed from their bracings, than they &s;eem plea&s;ed and happy; yet, &s;trange infatuation! The moment they hold their peace, they are again committed to their chains.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the body of an infant as a bundle of &s;oft pipes, repleni&s;h'd with fluids in continual motion, the dan|ger of pre&s;&s;ure will appear in the &s;tronge&s;t light. Nature, in order to make way for the growth of children, has form|ed their bodies &s;oft and flexible; and, le&s;t they &s;hould re|ceive any injury from pre&s;&s;ure in the womb, has &s;urrounded the <HI>foetus</HI> every way with fluids. This &s;hews the care which nature takes to prevent all unequal pre&s;&s;ure on the bodies of infants, and to defend them again&s;t every thing that might in the lea&s;t cramp or confine their motions.</P>
<P>EVEN the bones of an infant are &s;o &s;oft and cartilaginous, that they readily yield to the &s;lighte&s;t pre&s;&s;ure, and ea&s;ily take on a bad &s;hape, which can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ver after be remedied. Hence it is, that &s;o many people appear with high &s;houl|ders, crooked &s;pines and flat brea&s;ts, who were born with as good a &s;hape as others, but had the misfortune to be
<PB N="10" REF="012338_0014_0F88EA9F2AE72780">
&s;queezed into mon&s;ters by the application of &s;tays and bandages.</P>
<P>PRESSURE, by ob&s;tructing the circulation, prevents the equal di&s;tribution of nouri&s;hment to the different parts of the body, by which means the growth becomes unequal. One part of the body grows too large, while another re|mains too &s;mall, and thus in time the whole frame becomes di&s;proportioned and mis&s;hapen. To this we mu&s;t add, that when a child is cramped in its cloaths, it naturally &s;hrinks from the parts affected, and by putting its body into unna|tural po&s;tures, it becomes deformed by habit.</P>
<P>DEFORMITY of body may proceed from weakne&s;s or di&s;ea&s;es; but, in general, it is the effect of improper cloathing. Nine tenths, at lea&s;t, of the deformity among&s;t mankind mu&s;t be imputed to this cau&s;e. A deformed body is not only di&s;agreeable to the eye, but injurious to the health. By a bad figure both the animal and vital func|tions mu&s;t be impeded, and of cour&s;e health impaired. Hence, few people remarkably mis&s;hapen are &s;trong or healthy.</P>
<P>THE new motions which commence at the birth, as the circulation of the blood through the lungs, re&s;piration, the peri&s;taltic motion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> afford another &s;trong argument for keeping the body of an infant free from all pre&s;&s;ure. The&s;e organs, not having been accu&s;tomed to move, are ea&s;ily &s;topped; but when that happens, death mu&s;t en&s;ue. Hardly any method could be devi&s;ed more effectually to &s;top the&s;e motions than bracing the body too tight with<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is by no means inweighing again&s;t a thing that does not happen. In many parts of Britain at this day a roller, five or &s;ix feet in length, is applied round the child's body as &s;oon as it is born.</NOTE> rol|lers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Were the&s;e to be applied in the &s;ame manner to the body of an adult, for an equal length of time, they could hardly fail to hurt the dige&s;tion and make him &s;ick. How much more hurtful they mu&s;t be to tender infants, we &s;hall leave any one to judge.</P>
<P>WHOEVER con&s;iders the&s;e things, will not be &s;urpri&s;ed, that &s;o many children die of convul&s;ions &s;oon after the birth. The&s;e fits are generally attributed to &s;ome inward cau&s;e; but, in fact, they oftener proceed from our own imprudent conduct. I have known a child &s;eized with convul&s;ion-fits, &s;oon after the midwife had done &s;waddling it; but, upon taking off the rollers and bandages, it was
<PB N="11" REF="012338_0015_0F88EAA01AC9C1F0">
immediately relieved, and never had any convul&s;ion-fits af|terwards. Numerous examples of this &s;ort might be brought, were they nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IT would be &s;afer to fix on the cloaths of an infant with &s;trings than pins, as the&s;e often gall and irritate their tender &s;kins, and occa&s;ion convul&s;ions. In&s;tances have been known, where pins were found &s;ticking above half an inch into the body of a child after it had died of con|vul&s;ion-fits, which, in all probability, proceeded from that cau&s;e.</P>
<P>CHILDREN are not only hurt by the tightne&s;s of their cloaths, but al&s;o by the quantity. Every child has &s;ome degree of fever after the birth; and, if it be loaded with too many cloaths, the fever mu&s;t be increa&s;ed. But that is not all; the child is generally laid in bed with the mo|ther, who is likewi&s;e feveri&s;h; to which we may add the heat of the lying-in-bed-chamber, and the wines, and other heating things too often given to children immediate|ly after the birth. When all the&s;e are combined, which does not &s;eldom happen, they mu&s;t increa&s;e the fever to &s;uch a degree as will endanger the life of the infant.</P>
<P>THE danger of keeping infants too hot, will further ap|pear, if we con&s;ider, that, after being for &s;ome time in the &s;ituation mentioned above, they are often &s;ent into the country to be nur&s;ed in a cold hou&s;e *. Is it any wonder, if a child, from &s;uch a tran&s;ition, catches a mortal cold, or contracts &s;ome other fatal di&s;ea&s;e? When an infant is kept too hot, its lungs not being &s;ufficiently expanded, are apt to remain weak and flaccid for life; from whence pro|ceed coughs, con&s;umptions, and other di&s;ea&s;es of the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>IT would an&s;wer little purpo&s;e to &s;pecify the particular pieces of dre&s;s proper for an infant. The&s;e ever will vary in different places according to cu&s;tom and the humour of parents. The great rule to be ob&s;erved is, <HI>That a child have no more cloaths than are nece&s;&s;ary to keep it warm, and that they be quite ea&s;y for its body.</HI></P>
<P>STAYS are the very bane of children. A volume would not &s;uffice to point out all the ill effects of this u&s;ele&s;s piece of dre&s;s. The madne&s;s in favour of &s;tays &s;eems, however, to have been at a height; and it is to be hoped the world will, in time, become wi&s;e enough to know, that the hu|man
<PB N="12" REF="012338_0016_0F88EAA1B0BD0530">
&s;hape does not &s;olely depend upon whale-bone and bend leather<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stays made of bend-leather are worn by all the woman of lower &s;tation in many parts of England.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall only add, with re&s;pect to the cloaths of chil|dren, that they ought to be kept very clean. Children per&s;pire more than adults; and, if their cloaths be not frequently changed, they become very hurtful. Dirty cloaths not only gall and fret the tender &s;kins of infants, but likewi&s;e occa&s;ion ill &s;mells; and, what is wor&s;e, tend to produce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>CLEANLINESS is not only agreeable to the eye, but tends greatly to pre&s;erve the health of children. It pro|motes the per&s;piration; and, by that means, frees the body from &s;uperfluous humours, which, if retained, could not fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l to occa&s;ion di&s;ea&s;es. A nur&s;e can have no excu&s;e for allowing a child to be dirty. Poverty may oblige her to give it coar&s;e cloaths; but, if &s;he does not keep them clean, it mu&s;t be her own fault.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE FOOD OF CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>NATURE not only points out the food proper for an in|fant, but actually prepares it. This, however, is not &s;uf|ficient to prevent &s;ome who think them&s;elves wi&s;er than nature, from attempting to bring up their children with|out her provi&s;ion. Nothing can &s;how the di&s;po&s;ition which mankind have to depart from nature more than their en|deavouring to bring up children without the brea&s;t. The mother's milk, or that of a healthy nur&s;e, is unque&s;tion|ably the be&s;t food for an infant. Neither art nor nature can afford a proper &s;ub&s;titute for it. A child may &s;eem to thrive for a few months without the brea&s;t; but when teething, the &s;mall-pox, and other di&s;ea&s;es incident to childhood come on, they generally fall a victim. An evi|dent proof, that their food is unwhole&s;ome, and their hu|mours bad.</P>
<P>A child &s;oon after the birth &s;hews an inclination to &s;uck; and there &s;eems to be no rea&s;on why it &s;hould not be gra|tified. It is true, the mother's milk does not always come immediately after the birth; but is not this the way to bring it? The fir&s;t milk that the child can &s;queeze out of the brea&s;t, an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of clean&s;ing better than all the drugs in the apothecary's &s;hop, and at the &s;ame time
<PB N="13" REF="012338_0017_0F88EAA22C7F8678">
prevents inflammations of the brea&s;t, fevers, and other di&s;|ea&s;es incident to mothers.</P>
<P>IT is &s;trange how people came to think, that the fir&s;t thing given to a child &s;hould be drugs. This is beginning with medicines by times, and no wonder that they generally end with it. It &s;ometimes happens, that a child does not pa&s;s the <HI>meconium</HI> &s;o &s;oon as could be wi&s;hed. This has in|duced phy&s;icians in &s;uch ca&s;es to give &s;omething of an open|ing nature to clean&s;e the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages. Midwives have im|proved upon this hint, and never fail to give &s;yrups, oils, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whether they be nece&s;&s;ary or not. Cramming an in|fant with &s;uch indige&s;tible &s;tuff as &s;oon as it is born, can hardly fail to make it &s;ick, and is more likely to occa&s;ion di&s;ea&s;es, than prevent them. Children are &s;eldom long af|ter the birth without having pa&s;&s;age both by &s;tool and urine; though the&s;e evacuations may be wanting for &s;ome time without any danger.</P>
<P>WERE a child permitted to &s;uck its mother as &s;oon as it &s;hows an inclination for the brea&s;t, it would need no other phy&s;ic; but if it mu&s;t have &s;omething before it be allowed the brea&s;t, let it be a little &s;imple water-pap, to which may be added an equal quantity of new milk. If this be given without any wines, &s;ugars, or &s;piceries, it will neither heat the blood, load the &s;tomach, nor occa&s;ion gripes.</P>
<P>UPON the fir&s;t &s;ight of an infant, almo&s;t every per&s;on is &s;truck with the idea of its being weak, feeble, and wanting &s;upport. This naturally &s;ugge&s;ts the need of cordials. Accordingly we find wines univer&s;ally mixed with the fir&s;t food of children. Nothing can be more fallacious than this way of rea&s;oning, or more hurtful to infants than the conduct founded upon it. Children need very little food for &s;ome time after the birth; and what they receive, &s;hould be thin, weak, light, and of a cooling quality. A very &s;mall quantity of wine, or even &s;ugar, is &s;ufficient to heat and inflame the blood of an infant; but every per|&s;on, conver&s;ant in the&s;e matters, mu&s;t know, that mo&s;t of the di&s;ea&s;es of infants proceed from the heat of their hu|mours, as the thru&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IF the mother or nur&s;e has enough of milk, the child will need little or no other food before the third or fourth month. It will then be proper to give it, once or twice a day, a little of &s;ome food that is ea&s;y of dige&s;tion; as wa|ter-pap, milk-pottage, weak broth with bread in it, or the like. This will ea&s;e the mother; it will accu&s;tom the child
<PB N="14" REF="012338_0018_0F88EAA41A558038">
by degrees to take food, and render the weaning both le&s;s difficult and dangerous. All great and &s;udden tran&s;itions are to be avoided in nur&s;ing. For this purpo&s;e the food of chil|dren ought to be &s;imple, as near as po&s;&s;ible re&s;embling the properties of milk. Indeed milk it&s;elf &s;hould make a princi|pal part of their food, not only before they be weaned, but for a long time after.</P>
<P>NEXT to milk, we would recommend good light bread. Bread may be given to a child as &s;oon as it &s;hows an in|clination to chew, and it may at all times be allowed as much as it plea&s;es. The very chewing of bread will help to cut the teeth and promote the di&s;charge of <HI>&s;aliva,</HI> while by mix|ing with the nur&s;e's milk in the &s;tomach, it will afford an excellent nouri&s;hment. Children &s;how an early inclination to chew whatever is put into their hands. Parents ob&s;erve the inclination, but generally mi&s;take the object. In&s;tead of giving the child &s;omething which may at once exerci&s;e its gums and afford it nouri&s;hment, they commonly put into its hand a piece of hard metal or impenetrable coral. A cru&s;t of bread is the be&s;t gum-&s;tick. It not only an&s;wers the pur|po&s;e better than any thing el&s;e, but has the additional pro|perties mentioned above, of nouri&s;hing the child and car|rying the <HI>&s;aliva</HI> down to the &s;tomach, which is too valuable a liquor to be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>BREAD, be&s;ides being u&s;ed dry, may be many ways pre|pared into food for children. One of the be&s;t methods of preparing it, is to boil it in water, afterwards pouring the water off, and mixing with the bread a proper quantity of new milk unboiled: Milk is both more whole&s;ome and nouri&s;hing this way than boiled, and is le&s;s apt to occa&s;ion co&s;tivene&s;s. For a child farther advanced, bread may be mixed in veal or chicken broth, made into puddings or the like. Bread is a proper food for children at all times, pro|vided it be plain, made of whole&s;ome grain, and well fer|mented; but when enriched with fruits, &s;ugars, or &s;uch things, it becomes very unwhole&s;ome.</P>
<P>IT is &s;oon enough to allow children animal food when they have got teeth to eat it. They &s;hould never ta&s;te it till after they are weaned, and even then they ought to u&s;e it very &s;paringly. Indeed, when children live wholely on vegetable food, it is apt to &s;our on their &s;tomachs; on the other hand, too much fle&s;h heats the blood and occa&s;ions fevers and other inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es. This plainly points out a proper mixture of animal and vegetable food as mo&s;t fit for children.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="012338_0019_0F88EAA5B45A0210">
FEW things are more hurtful to children, than the com|mon method of &s;weetening their food. It not only makes them grow fat and bloated, but entices them to take more food than they ought to do. It is pretty certain, if childrens' food were quite plain, that they would never take more than enough. Thus the exce&s;&s;es of children are entirely owing to nur&s;es. If a child be gorged with food at all hours, and enticed to take it, by making it &s;weet and agreeable to the palate, is it any wonder if &s;uch a child comes in time to crave more food than it ought to have?</P>
<P>CHILDREN may be hurt by too little as well as too much food. After a child is weaned, it ought to be fed four or five times a-day; but &s;hould never be accu&s;tomed to eat in the night; neither &s;hould it have too much at one time. Some lay it down as a rule, that no child ought to be fed above three times in twenty-four hours; whereas, mo&s;t adults eat four times in the &s;ame &s;pace. The food of chil|dren is generally lighter than that of adults; their dige&s;tion is likewi&s;e more quickly performed: If to the&s;e we add the power of habit, we will be inclined to think, that children &s;hould be fed oftener than up-grown per&s;ons. If a child, who has been accu&s;tomed to &s;uck its nur&s;e at all hours, be &s;uddenly deprived of that, and re&s;tricted to three meals a-day, bad con&s;equences mu&s;t follow. I have often &s;een the &s;cheme of bringing children to live on three regular meals a-day tried, but never knew it &s;ucceed. Children thrive much better with &s;mall quantities of food frequently given. This neither overcharges the &s;tomach, nor hurts the di|ge&s;tion, and is certainly mo&s;t agreeable to nature.</P>
<P>WRITERS on nur&s;ing, have inveighed with &s;uch vehe|mence again&s;t too much food, that one would be apt to imagine two thirds of tho&s;e who die in infancy were actu|ally crammed to death. This has induced many parents to ruin the con&s;titutions of their children, by running into the other extreme. The error of pinching children in their food, is more hurtful than its oppo&s;ite. Nature has many ways of relieving her&s;elf when overcharged; but a child who is pinched with hunger will never become a &s;trong or healty man. That errors are frequently committed on both &s;ides, we are ready to acknowledge; but where one child is hurt by the quantity of its food, ten &s;uffer from the qua|lity. That is the principle evil, and claims our &s;tricte&s;t at|tention.</P>
<P>MANY people imagine, that food which they love them|&s;elves cannot be bad for their children: But this notion is
<PB N="16" REF="012338_0020_0F88EAA653103BD8">
very ab&s;urd. In the more advanced periods of life we often acquire an inclination for food which when children we could not bear to ta&s;te. There are many things that may agree very well with the &s;tomach of an up-grown per&s;on, which would be very hurtful to a child; as high-&s;ea&s;oned, &s;alted, and &s;moke-dried provi&s;ions, &amp;c. It would al&s;o be improper to feed children with fat meat, &s;trong broths, rich &s;oups, gravies, or the like.</P>
<P>ALL &s;trong liquors are hurtful to children. Some parents teach their children to guzzle ale, and other &s;trong liquors at every meal; but &s;uch a practice cannot fail to do mi&s;|chief. The&s;e children &s;eldom e&s;cape the violence of the &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, hooping-cough, or &s;ome other feveri&s;h di&s;order. Milk, water, butter-milk, or whey, make the mo&s;t proper drink for children. If they have any thing &s;tronger, it may be fine &s;mall bear, or a little wine mixed with water. The &s;tomachs of children can dige&s;t well enough without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of warm &s;timulants. Young people are naturally hot, and con&s;equently are ea&s;ily hurt by every thing of a heating quality: Their blood has a con|&s;tant tendency to inflammation, which all &s;trong liquors mu&s;t increa&s;e.</P>
<P>FEW things are more hurtful to children than unripe fruits. The&s;e not only &s;our the &s;tomach, but relax it and weaken the dige&s;tion; by which means it becomes a pro|per ne&s;t for worms of all kinds. Children indeed &s;how the greate&s;t inclination for fruit, and I am apt to believe, that if good ripe fruit were allowed them in proper quantity, it would have no bad effects. We &s;eldom find a natural incli|nation wrong, if directed to its proper objects. Fruits are generally of a cooling nature, and correct the heat and acri|mony of the humours. This is what mo&s;t children want; only care &s;hould be taken le&s;t they exceed. Indeed the be&s;t way to prevent children from going to exce&s;s in the u&s;e of fruit, or eating that which is bad, is to allow them a proper quantity of what is good.</P>
<P>ROOTS which contain a crude vi&s;cid juice &s;hould be &s;pa|ringly given to children. They fill the body with gro&s;s hu|mours, and tend to produce eruptive di&s;ea&s;es. This caution is peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary for the poor; being glad to get what will fill their children's bellies for a little money, they &s;tuff them two or three times a-day with potatoes and the like. Children had better eat a &s;mall quantity of &s;uch food as would yield a whole&s;ome nouri&s;hment, than be crammed with what their dige&s;tive powers are unable properly to a&s;&s;imulate.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="012338_0021_0F88EAA6AE6A5EB8">
BUTTER ought likewi&s;e to be &s;paringly given to children. It both relaxes the &s;tomach, and produces gro&s;s humours. Indeed, mo&s;t things that are fat or oily, have the &s;ame ef|fect. Butter, when &s;alted, becomes &s;till more hurtful. In|&s;tead of butter, &s;o plentifully eat by children in mo&s;t parts of Britain, we would recommend honey. Honey is not only more whole&s;ome than butter, but likewi&s;e cheaper. It is cooling, clean&s;ing, and tends to &s;weeten the humours; whereas butter is ju&s;t the rever&s;e. Children who eat honey are &s;eldom troubled with worms. They are al&s;o le&s;s &s;ubject to the common cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es, as itch, &s;cabbed-head, &amp;c.</P>
<P>MANY people err in thinking the diet of children &s;hould be always moi&s;t. When children live entirely upon &s;lops, it relaxes their &s;olids, renders them weak, and predi&s;po&s;es them to rickets, &s;crophulas, and other glandular di&s;orders. Relaxation is one of the mo&s;t general cau&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;es of children. Every thing therefore which tends to unbrace their bodies ought to be carefully avoided.</P>
<P>WE would not be under&s;tood as confining children to any particular kind of food. Their diet may be frequently varied, provided regard be had to &s;implicity. Whatever food we are mo&s;t accu&s;tomed to in youth, we generally love during life. For this rea&s;on children &s;hould have a little of any kind of food that is plain and whole&s;ome, le&s;t they &s;hould contract an aver&s;ion for it, and afterwards be under the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing it.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE EXERCISE OF CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the cau&s;es which con&s;pire to render the lives of children &s;hort and mi&s;erable, none has greater influence than the want of proper exerci&s;e: Healthy parents, whole|&s;ome food, and proper cloathing, will avail little where i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> is neglected. Enough of exerci&s;e will make up for &s;everal other defects; but nothing can &s;upply the want of it. It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the health, the growth, and the &s;trength of children.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ire of exerci&s;e is almo&s;t co-eval with life it&s;elf. Were this principle attended to, many di&s;ea&s;es might be prevented. But while indolence and &s;edentary employ|ments keep two thirds of mankind from either taking ex|erci&s;e them&s;elves, or giving it to their children, what have we to expect but di&s;ea&s;es and deformity among their off|&s;pring? The rickets, &s;o de&s;tructive to children, never ap|peared
<PB N="18" REF="012338_0022_0F88EAA7AC200540">
in Britain till manufactures began to flouri&s;h, and people, attracted by the love of gain, left the country to follow &s;edentary employments in great towns. It is among&s;t the&s;e people that this di&s;ea&s;e chiefly prevails, and not only deforms, but kills many of their offspring.</P>
<P>THE analogy of other animals &s;hews that children re|quire exerci&s;e. Every creature endeavours to make u&s;e of its organs as &s;oon as it can, and many of them, even when under no nece&s;&s;ity of moving in que&s;t of food, cannot be re|&s;trained without force. This is evidently the ca&s;e with the calf, the lamb, and many other young animals. If the&s;e creatures were not permitted to fri&s;k about, and take ex|erci&s;e, they would &s;oon die. The &s;ame inclination appears very early in the human &s;pecies; but as they are not able to take exerci&s;e them&s;elves, it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of their parents or nur&s;es to a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>CHILDREN may be exerci&s;ed various ways. The be&s;t me|thod, while light, is to carry them about in the nur&s;e's arms. This gives the nur&s;e an opportunity of talking to the child, and of pointing out every thing that may plea&s;e and delight its fancy. It is much &s;afer than &s;winging an infant in a machine, or lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">g it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the care of &s;uch as are not fit to take care of them&s;elves. Nothing can be more fooli&s;h than to &s;et on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> child to keep another; that has proved fatal to many infants, and has rendered others lame for life.</P>
<P>WHEN children begin to walk, the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t method of leading them about is by the hands. The common way of &s;winging<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> children by &s;trings fixed to their backs, has many bad con&s;equences. It makes them throw their bo|dies foreward, and pre&s;s with their whole weight upon the brea&s;t: by that means the breathing is ob&s;tructed, the brea&s;t flattened, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">owels compre&s;&s;ed. This hurts the di|ge&s;tion, and occa&s;ions con&s;umptions of the lungs, and other di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>IT is a common notion, that if children be &s;et upon their feet too &s;oon, their legs will become crooked. There is rea&s;on to believe, that the very rever&s;e of this is true. Eve|ry member acquires &s;trength in proportion as it is exerci&s;ed. The limbs of children are weak indeed, but their bodies are proportionably light; and had they &s;kill to direct them|&s;elves, they would &s;oon be able to &s;upport their own weight. Who ever heard of any other animal that became crooked by u&s;ing its legs too &s;oon? Indeed if a child be not permit|ted to make u&s;e of its legs till a con&s;iderable time after the
<PB N="19" REF="012338_0023_0F88EAA82A7366B0">
birth, and be then &s;et upon them with its whole weight at once, there may be &s;ome danger of hurting it; but this proceeds intirely from the child's not having been accu&s;tom|ed to u&s;e its legs from the beginning.</P>
<P>MOTHERS of the poorer &s;ort think they gain a great deal by making their children lie or &s;it while they work. In this they are greatly mi&s;taken. By neglecting to give their chil|dren exerci&s;e, they are obliged to keep them a long time before they can do any thing for them&s;elves, and to &s;pend more on medicine than would have paid for proper care, while it can never &s;upply its place. To take care of their children, is the mo&s;t profitable bu&s;ine&s;s in which even the poor can employ them&s;elves: But alas! it is not always in their power. Poverty often obliges them to neglect their offspring, in order to procure the nece&s;&s;aries of life. When that is the ca&s;e, it becomes the intere&s;t as well as the duty of the public to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. Ten thou&s;and times more be|nefit would accrue to the &s;tate, by enabling the poor to bring up their own children, than from all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If we make it the intere&s;t of the poor to keep their offspring alive, we &s;hall lo&s;e very few of them.

This would make the poor e&s;teem fertility a ble&s;&s;ing; whereas many of them think it the greate&s;t cur&s;e that can befal them; and in place of wi&s;hing their children to live, &s;o far does po|verty get the better of natural affection, that they are very happy when they die.</NOTE> ho&s;pitals that ever can be erected for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>WHOEVER con&s;iders the &s;tructure of the human body, will &s;oon be convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of exerci&s;e for the health of children. The body is compo&s;ed of an infinite number of ve&s;&s;els, who&s;e contents cannot be pu&s;hed on with|out the action and pre&s;&s;ure of the mu&s;cles. But if the fluids remain inactive, ob&s;tructions mu&s;t happen, and the humours will of cour&s;e be vitiated, which cannot fail to occa&s;ion di&s;|ea&s;es. Nature has furni&s;hed both the ve&s;&s;els which carry the blood and lymph with numerous valves, in order that the action of every mu&s;cle might pu&s;h forward their contents; but without action this admirable contrivance can have no effect. The final cau&s;e of this part of the animal oeconomy proves the nece&s;&s;ity of exerci&s;e for the pre&s;ervation of health.</P>
<P>ARGUMENTS to &s;hew the importance of exerci&s;e might be drawn from every part of the animal oeconomy: With|out
<PB N="20" REF="012338_0024_0F88EAA96B803B00">
exerci&s;e the circulation of the blood cannot be properly carried on, nor the different &s;ecretions duly performed; without exerci&s;e the humours cannot be properly prepared, nor the &s;olids rendered &s;trong or firm. The action of the heart, the motion of the lungs, and all the vital functions are greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by exerci&s;e. But to point out the man|ner in which the&s;e effects are produced, would lead us far|ther into the oeconomy of the human body, than mo&s;t of tho&s;e for whom this treati&s;e is intended, would be able to follow. We &s;hall therefore only add, that where exerci&s;e is neglected, none of the animal functions can be duly per|formed; and when that is the ca&s;e, the whole con&s;titution mu&s;t go to wreck.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY our fir&s;t object in the management of chil|dren ought to be a good con&s;titution. This lays a founda|tion for their being u&s;eful and happy in life; and whoever neglects it, not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ails in his duty to his offspring, but to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>ONE very common error of parents, by which they hurt the con&s;titutions of their children, is &s;ending them too young to &s;chool. This is often done &s;olely to prevent trouble. When the child is at &s;chool, he needs no keeper. Thus the &s;choolma&s;ter is made the nur&s;e; and the poor child is nailed to a &s;eat &s;even or eight hours a-day, which ought to be &s;pent in exerci&s;e and diver&s;ions. Sitting &s;o long cannot fail to produce the wor&s;t effects upon the body; nor is the mind le&s;s injured. Early application weakens the fa|culties, and often fixes in the mind &s;uch an aver&s;ion from books as can never be removed.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;e this were the way to make children &s;cholars, that ought not to be done at the expence of their con&s;titu|tions. Our ance&s;tors, who &s;eldom went to &s;chool before they were men, were not le&s;s learned than we. But we imagine the boy's education will be quite lo&s;t unle&s;s he be carried to &s;chool in his nur&s;e's arms. No wonder if &s;uch hot bed plants &s;eldom become either &s;cholars or men!</P>
<P>NOT only the confinement in public &s;chools, but the number often proves extremely hurtful. Children are much injured by being kept in crowds within doors; their breath|ing not only renders the place unwhole&s;ome; but if any one of them happens to be di&s;ea&s;ed, the re&s;t catch the infection. A &s;ingle child has been often known to communicate the bloody-flux, the hooping-cough, the itch, or other di&s;ea&s;es, to almo&s;t every individual in a numerous &s;chool.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="012338_0025_0F88EAA9CDC767A0">
BUT if fa&s;hion will prevail, and infants mu&s;t be &s;ent to &s;chool, we would earne&s;tly recommend to teachers, as they value the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, not to confine them too long at a time; but to permit them to run about and play at &s;uch active diver&s;ions as may promote their growth and improve their con&s;titutions. Were boys, in&s;tead of being whipped, for &s;tealing an hour to run, ride, &s;wim, or the like, encou|raged to employ their time in the&s;e manly and u&s;eful ex|erci&s;es, it would have many excellent effects.</P>
<P>IT would likewi&s;e be of great &s;ervice to boys, if at a pro|per age, they were all taught the military exerci&s;e. This would improve their &s;trength, courage, and agility; and, when their country called for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, it would enable them to act in her defence, without being obliged to under|go a tedious and trouble&s;ome cour&s;e of in&s;tructions, at a time when they are le&s;s fit to learn new motions, ge&s;tures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>AN effeminate education will infallibly &s;poil the be&s;t na|tural con&s;titution; and, if boys are brought up in a more delicate manner than even girls ought to be, they never will be men.</P>
<P>BUT the common education of girls is no le&s;s hurtful to the con&s;titution than that of boys. Mi&s;s is &s;et down to her frame, before &s;he can put on her cloaths; and is taught to believe, that to excel at the needle is the only thing that can intitle her to general e&s;teem. It is unnece&s;&s;ary here to in|&s;i&s;t upon the dangerous con&s;equences of obliging girls to &s;it too much. They are pretty well known, and are too often felt at a certain time of life. But &s;uppo&s;e this critical pe|riod to be got over, greater dangers &s;till await them when they come to be mothers. Women who have been early accu&s;tomed to a &s;edentary life, generally run great hazard in childbed; while tho&s;e who have been u&s;ed to romp about, and take enough of exerci&s;e, are &s;eldom in any danger.</P>
<P>ONE hardly meets with a girl who can, at the &s;ame time, boa&s;t of early performances by the needle, and a good con|&s;titution. Clo&s;e and early confinement generally occa&s;ions indige&s;tions, headachs, pale complexions, pain of the &s;to|mach, lo&s;s of appetite, coughs, con&s;umptions of the lungs, and deformity of body. The latter indeed is not to be wondered at, con&s;idering the aukward po&s;tures in which girls &s;it at many kinds of needle-work, and the delicate flexible &s;tate of their bodies in the early periods of life.</P>
<P>WOULD mothers, in&s;tead of having their daughters in|&s;tructed in many u&s;ele&s;s accompli&s;hments, teach them plain
<PB N="22" REF="012338_0026_0F88EAAB66F35810">
work and hou&s;ewifery, allowing them enough of time to run about, they would both make them better mothers and more u&s;eful members of &s;ociety. I am no enemy to gen|teel accompli&s;hments, but would have them only con|&s;idered as &s;econdary, and always di&s;regarded when they impair health.</P>
<P>MANY people imagine it a great advantage for children to be early taught to gain their bread. This opinion is certainly right, provided they be &s;o employed as not to hurt their health or growth; but, when the&s;e &s;uffer, &s;o|ciety, in place of being gainers, are real lo&s;ers by their labour. There are few employments, except &s;edentary ones, by which children can earn a livelihood; and, if they be &s;et to tho&s;e too &s;oon, it ruins their con&s;titutions. Thus, by gaining a few years from childhood, we generally lo&s;e twice as many in the other periods of life, and even render the per&s;on le&s;s valuable while he does live.</P>
<P>IN order to be &s;atisfied of the truth of this ob&s;ervation, one needs only look into the great manufacturing towns, where he will find a puny degenerate race of people, weak and &s;ickly all their lives, &s;eldom exceeding the middle pe|riod of life; or, if they do, being unfit for bu&s;ine&s;s, they become a burden to &s;ociety. Thus, arts and manufactures, though they may increa&s;e the riches of a country, are by no means favourable to the health of its inhabitants. Good policy would therefore require, that &s;uch people as labour during life, &s;hould not be &s;et too early to work. Every per&s;on conver&s;ant in the breeding of hor&s;es, or other work-animals, knows, that, if they be &s;et to hard labour too &s;oon, they never will turn out to advantage. This is equally true with re&s;pect to the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P>THERE are neverthele&s;s various ways of employing young people, without hurting their health. The ea&s;ier parts of gardening, hu&s;bandry, or any bu&s;ine&s;s carried on without doors, are mo&s;t proper. The&s;e are employments that mo&s;t young people are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ond of, and &s;ome parts of them may al|ways be adapted to their age, ta&s;te and &s;trength.</P>
<P>SUCH parents, however, as are under the nece&s;&s;ity of employing their children within doors, ought to allow them enough of time for active diver&s;ions. This would both encourage them to do more work, and prevent their con|&s;titutions from being hurt.</P>
<P>SOME imagine, that exerci&s;e within doors is &s;ufficient; but they are greatly mi&s;taken. One hour &s;pent in running,
<PB N="23" REF="012338_0027_0F88EAABE9CC8020">
or any other exerci&s;e without doors, is worth ten within. When children cannot go abroad, they ought indeed to be exerci&s;ed at home. The be&s;t method of doing this, is to make them run about in a long room, or dance. This la&s;t kind of exerci&s;e, if not carried to exce&s;s, is of ex|cellent &s;ervice to young people. It cheers the &s;pirit, pro|motes per&s;piration, &s;trengthens the limbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> An eminent phy&s;ician u&s;ed to &s;ay, that he made his children dance, in|&s;tead of giving them phy&s;ic. It were well, if more people followed his example.</P>
<P>AS many of the chronic di&s;ea&s;es of children might be prevented by the prudent u&s;e of the COLD BATH, we &s;hall point out &s;ome of tho&s;e mi&s;takes which commonly prevent its having the de&s;ired effect.</P>
<P>THE Cold Bath may be con&s;idered as an aid to exerci&s;e. By it the body is braced and &s;trengthened, the circulation and &s;ecretions promoted, and, were it conducted with pru|dence, many di&s;ea&s;es, as the rickets, &s;crophula, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> might thereby be prevented. The antients, who took every me|thod to render children hardy and robu&s;t, were no &s;tran|gers to the u&s;e of the cold bath; and, if we may judge from the great number of con&s;ecrated wells in this i&s;land, many of which po&s;&s;e&s;s no other virtues but tho&s;e of cold water, yet are &s;aid to have been famous for curing the di&s;|ea&s;es of children, we will &s;ee cau&s;e to believe, that the practice of immer&s;ing children in cold water mu&s;t have been very common among&s;t our ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>SO far as I have been able to ob&s;erve, the cold bath does as much mi&s;chief as good; but that is owing to the want of due care in u&s;ing it. Children born of delicate parents are not &s;uddenly to be plunged over the head in cold wa|ter. They mu&s;t be gradually brought to it by u&s;ing tepid water at fir&s;t, and making it a little cooler every time they are bathed, till by degrees they be able to bear it quite cold. Children afflicted with internal di&s;ea&s;es, as inflam|mations or ob&s;tructions of the brea&s;t, bowels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ought not to be bathed in cold water. No child &s;hould be put into the cold bath, when its body is hot, nor immediately after a meal.</P>
<P>IT is next to impo&s;&s;ible to bring nur&s;es to make a proper u&s;e of the cold bath: Their prejudices are &s;o &s;trong and deep-rooted, that no rea&s;oning is able to bring them off their own way. I have known &s;ome of them, who would not dry a child's &s;kin after bathing it, le&s;t it &s;hould de&s;troy
<PB N="24" REF="012338_0028_0F88EAADD77F2EB8">
the effect of the water. Others will even put cloaths dipt in the water upon the child, and either put it to bed, or &s;uffer it to go about in that condition. Some nur&s;es be|lieve, that the whole virtue of the water depends upon its being dedicated to &s;ome particular &s;aint. The&s;e will carry a child 40, 50, or 100 miles to have it once dipt in a cer|tain well; and this is to cure it of what&s;oever di&s;ea&s;e it la|bours under. Others place their confidence in a certain number of dips, as three, &s;even, nine, or the like, and the world could not per&s;uade them, if the&s;e do not &s;uc|ceed, to try it a little longer.</P>
<P>THUS, by the whims and caprice of nur&s;es, a valuable medicine is lo&s;t, and the phy&s;ician is often di&s;appointed in his hopes by their mi&s;conduct. When the cold bath is u&s;ed as a medicine, it ought always to be by the advice of a phy|&s;ician, and the nur&s;e &s;hould adhere &s;trictly to his directions. I have &s;een wonderful cures in the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate &s;crophu|lous ca&s;es performed by the cold bath. The &s;alt water in this ca&s;e is always to be preferred. That will &s;ucceed where all other medicines have failed.</P>
<P>EVERY child, when in health, ought to have its extre|mities at lea&s;t wa&s;hed with cold water daily. This is a partial u&s;e of the cold bath, and is better than none. In winter this may &s;uffice; but in the warm &s;ea&s;on, if a child be relaxed, or &s;eem to have a tendency to the rickets or &s;crophula, its whole body ought to be daily immer&s;ed in cold water. Care however mu&s;t be taken not to do this when the body is hot, or the &s;tomach full. The child &s;hould be dipt only once at a time, &s;hould be taken out immediately, and have its &s;kin well rubbed with a dry cloth.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE BAD EFFECTS OF UNWHOLESOME AIR UPON CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>FEW things are more de&s;tructive to children than con|fined or unwhole&s;ome air. This is one rea&s;on why &s;o few of tho&s;e infants live who are put into ho&s;pitals, or pari&s;h-workhou&s;es. The&s;e places are generally crowded with old, &s;ickly and infirm people. By that means the air is ren|dered &s;o extremely pernicious, that it becomes a poi&s;on to infants.</P>
<P>WANT of whole&s;ome air is likewi&s;e de&s;tructive to many of the children born in great towns. There the poorer &s;ort
<PB N="25" REF="012338_0029_0F88EAAE5BC0D3F0">
of inhabitants live in low, dirty, confined hou&s;es, where the fre&s;h air has no acce&s;s. Though up-grown people, who are hardy and robu&s;t, may live for a number of years in &s;uch &s;ituations, yet they generally prove fatal to their off|&s;pring, few of whom arrive at maturity, and tho&s;e who do, are weak and deformed. Such people, not being able to carry their children abroad into the open air, we mu&s;t lay our account with lo&s;ing the greater part of their progeny. But the rich have not that excu&s;e. It is their bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee that their children be daily carried abroad, and that they be kept in the open air for a &s;ufficient time. This will &s;uc|ceed better, if the mother goes along with them. Servants are often negligent in the&s;e matters, and allow a child to &s;it or lie on the damp ground, in place of leading or carry|ing it about. The mother &s;urely needs air as well as her children; and how can &s;he be better employed than in at|tending them? Some may think this office below their dignity; but I know no &s;ituation in which a mother ap|pears to &s;uch advantage, as when &s;urrounded by a circle of healthy children.</P>
<P>A very bad cu&s;tom prevails of making children &s;leep in &s;mall apartments, or crowding two or three beds into one chamber. In place of that, the nur&s;ery ought always to be the large&s;t and be&s;t aired room in the hou&s;e. When children are confined in &s;mall apartments, the air is not only unwhole&s;ome, but &s;uch places being generally too hot, their bodies are relaxed, and this di&s;po&s;es them to catch cold when they go abroad, and has many other bad effects.</P>
<P>CHILDREN who are kept within doors all day, and &s;leep all night in warm clo&s;e apartments, may, with great pro|priety, be compared to plants nur&s;ed in a hot-hou&s;e, in place of the open air. Though &s;uch plants, by extraor|dinary care, may be kept alive for &s;ome time; yet they never will arrive at that degree of &s;trength, vigour and magnitude, which they would have done in the open air, nor would they be able to bear it afterwards, &s;hould they be expo&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>CHILDREN brought up in the country, who have been accu&s;tomed to fre&s;h open air, &s;hould not be too early &s;ent to great towns, where the air is confined and unwhole|&s;ome. This is frequently done with a view to forward their education, but proves very hurtful to health. Tho&s;e who are grown up, do not &s;uffer near &s;o much from bad

air as young per&s;ons. All &s;chools and &s;eminaries of learn|ing ought to be &s;o &s;ituated as to have fre&s;h, dry, whole|&s;ome air, and &s;hould never be too much crowded.</P>
<P>WITHOUT entering into a detail of the particular ad|vantages of whole&s;ome air to children, we &s;hall only ob|&s;erve, that when they enjoy that ble&s;&s;ing, they generally &s;leep well, eat well, and thrive accordingly. It braces and &s;trengthens their bodies, enlivens their &s;pirits, and every way promotes their growth and health.</P>

<HEAD>OF NURSES.</HEAD>
<P>NURSES are guilty of many faults, which prove fatal to infants. It is therefore the duty of parents to watch over their conduct with the greate&s;t care, and to be extremely cautious in the choice of them.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t common faults of nur&s;es is to do&s;e children with &s;tupifactives, or &s;uch things as lull them a&s;leep. An indolent nur&s;e, who does not give a child enough of exerci&s;e in the open air to make it &s;leep, and does not chu&s;e to be di&s;turbed by it in the night, will &s;el|dom fail to procure for it a do&s;e of laudanum, diacodium, &s;affron, or, what an&s;wers the &s;ame end, a dram of &s;pirits, or other &s;trong liquors. The&s;e, though they be certain poi&s;on to children, are every day admini&s;tered by many who bear the character of very good nur&s;es.</P>
<P>A nur&s;e who has not enough of milk, is apt to imagine, that &s;he can &s;upply that defect by giving the child wines, cordial waters, or other &s;trong liquors. This is an egre|gious mi&s;take. The only thing that has any chance to &s;upply the place of the nur&s;e's milk, mu&s;t be &s;omewhat nearly of the &s;ame quality, as cow's milk, a&s;s's milk, or the like, with good bread. It never can be done by the help of &s;trong liquors. The&s;e, in place of nouri&s;hing an infant, never fail to produce the contrary effect.</P>
<P>CHILDREN are often hurt by nur&s;es permitting them to cry long and vehemently. This &s;trains their tender bo|dies, and frequently occa&s;ions ruptures, inflammations of the throat, lungs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The nur&s;e who can hear an infant cry till it has almo&s;t exhau&s;ted it&s;elf, without endeavouring to plea&s;e it, mu&s;t be cruel indeed, and is unworthy to be tru&s;ted with the care of a human creature.</P>
<P>NURSES who deal much in medicine, are always to be &s;u&s;pected. They tru&s;t to it, and neglect their duty. I
<PB N="27" REF="012338_0031_0F88EAAFE8168AF0">
never knew a good nur&s;e who had her Godfrey's cordials, Daffy's elixirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at hand. Such generally imagine, that a do&s;e of the&s;e will make up for all defects in food, air, exerci&s;e, cleanline&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>A very pernicious cu&s;tom of indolent nur&s;es is the al|lowing of children to continue long wet. This is not only di&s;agreeable, but it galls and frets the infant, and by relaxing the &s;olids, occa&s;ions &s;crophulas, rickets, and other fatal di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>NATURE often attempts to free the bodies of children from bad humours, by throwing them out upon the &s;kin: By that means fevers, and other di&s;ea&s;es are prevented. Nur&s;es are apt to mi&s;take &s;uch critical eruptions for an itch, or &s;ome other infectious di&s;order. Accordingly they take every method to drive them in. In this way many children lo&s;e their lives; and no wonder, as nature is oppo&s;ed in the very method that &s;he took to relieve them. It ought to be a rule which every nur&s;e &s;hould ob&s;erve, never to &s;top any eruption without proper advice, or being well a&s;&s;ured, that it is not of a critical nature. At any rate it is never to be done without previous evacuations.</P>
<P>LOOSE &s;tools is another method by which nature often prevents the di&s;ea&s;es of infants. If the&s;e proceed too far, no doubt they ought to be checked; but this is never to be done without the greate&s;t caution. Nur&s;es, upon the fir&s;t appearance of loo&s;e &s;tools, frequently fly to the u&s;e of a&s;tringents, or &s;uch things as bind the belly. Thus in|flammations, fevers, and other fatal di&s;ea&s;es are brought on. A do&s;e of rhubarb, a gentle vomit, or &s;ome other evacua|tion, &s;hould always precede the u&s;e of a&s;tringent medicines.</P>
<P>ONE of the greate&s;t faults of nur&s;es is concealing the di&s;ea&s;es of children from their parents. This they are extremely ready to do, e&s;pecially when the di&s;ea&s;e is the effect of their own negligence. Every per&s;on mu&s;t have &s;een in&s;tances of people who were lame for life, by a fall out of the nur&s;e's arms, while &s;he, through fear, conceal|ed the mi&s;fortune till it was pa&s;t cure. Every parent who intru&s;ts a nur&s;e with the care of a child, ought to give her the &s;tricte&s;t charge not to conceal the mo&s;t trifling di&s;|order or misfortune that may befal it. Parents, in&s;tead of being angry, when a nur&s;e informs them of &s;uch accidents, ought to reward her for her hone&s;ty; this would encourage her to do the &s;ame upon other occa&s;ions. We can &s;ee no rea&s;on why a nur&s;e &s;hould not be puni&s;hed who conceals
<PB N="28" REF="012338_0032_0F88EAB06F32F648">
any di&s;order or misfortune that happens to a child under her care, till it lo&s;es its life. A few examples of this would &s;ave many infant lives; but as there is little rea&s;on to expect, that it ever will be the ca&s;e, we would earne&s;tly recommend it to all parents to look carefully after their children, and not to tru&s;t &s;o valuable a trea&s;ure entirely in the hands of an hireling.</P>
<P>THESE, and many other faults, being daily committed by tho&s;e who have the care of children, it ought &s;urely to rou&s;e the attention of all parents who have any regard for their offspring, and to make them very circum&s;pect in the choice of tho&s;e into who&s;e hands they commit them. They ought at lea&s;t to take care that a nur&s;e be &s;ober, cleanly, hone&s;t, healthy, not too young, nor the contrary; that &s;he have the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and a comfortable ha|bitation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WERE it practicable to have all children nur&s;ed and educated in the country, we &s;hould lo&s;e very few of them. One &s;eldom &s;ees a country-farmer without a numerous off|&s;pring, mo&s;t of whom arrive at maturity. Many things con&s;pire to that end. The children of the&s;e people are generally nur&s;ed by their mothers; they eat plain whole|&s;ome food, enjoy the benefit of fre&s;h air, and have enough of proper exerci&s;e; they have rural &s;ports and pa&s;times &s;uited to their age, and as they grow up, find employments adapted to their &s;trength, agreeable to their inclinations, and conducive to their health. They learn indu&s;try and &s;o|briety from their parents, and &s;eldom fail to practi&s;e the&s;e virtues for life. In fine, we cannot help joining with the learned Mr. Locke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On Education.</NOTE>, in recommending the example of the&s;e people as a model to all in the management of their children.</P>

<P N="9">9. IF an infant mu&s;t have food before it &s;ucks, let it be water-pap mixed with new milk, free of all wines, &s;ugars, &s;piceries, or the like.</P>

<HEAD>OF ADULTS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING endeavoured to point out &s;ome of the &s;ources from which the di&s;ea&s;es and mortality of in|fants proceed, we &s;hall next take a view of the more ge|neral cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es, or &s;uch things as endanger the health of mankind in the more advanced periods of life.</P>
<P>NO man, however careful, can at all times avoid di&s;|ea&s;es; yet nothing is more certain than that many of them, and tho&s;e too of the mo&s;t dangerous nature, are often ow|ing to the want of care. The &s;malle&s;t cau&s;es, when ne|glected, generally produce the greate&s;t effects. This is &s;trictly true with re&s;pect to di&s;ea&s;es. A little care would often prevent what no medicine can cure.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t common cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;es in this i&s;land is an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, or what commonly goes by the name of CATCHING COLD. The per&s;piration is by far the mo&s;t con&s;iderable di&s;charge from the body; and &s;o long as it goes on properly, we have &s;eldom any complaints; but when it is ob&s;tructed, the health mu&s;t &s;uffer. Men being le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of this than of the other evacuations, are con&s;equently not &s;o attentive to the various cau&s;es which ob&s;truct it: We &s;hall therefore point out &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of them, in order to put people upon their guard.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>COMMON CAUSES OF CATCHING COLD.</HEAD>
<P>COLDS are often occa&s;ioned by &s;udden changes in the atmo&s;phere. There is no country where &s;uch changes hap|pen more frequently than in Britain. The degrees of heat and cold are not only various in the different &s;ea&s;ons of the year, but often change from the one extreme to the other in a few days, and &s;ometimes even in the cour&s;e of one day. As the&s;e changes cannot fail to increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the per&s;piration, they mu&s;t of cour&s;e affect the health.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t method of fortifying the body again&s;t the changes of the weather, is to be abroad every day. Tho&s;e who keep much within doors, are mo&s;t liable to catch cold.
<PB N="32" REF="012338_0036_0F88EAB689413F58">
Such people feel even the &s;lighte&s;t changes in the atmo&s;|phere, and by their coughs, pains and oppre&s;&s;ions of the brea&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> become a kind of living barometers.</P>
<P>THE frequent changes of the weather ought to make us cautious in changing our apparel. All per&s;ons, but e&s;pecially the valetudinary, &s;hould be careful not to put off their winter-garments too &s;oon, nor to wear their &s;ummer ones too long. The commencement of our warm &s;ea&s;on is &s;o uncertain, that a few hot days in April or May often make us believe &s;ummer is arrived; when all of a &s;udden the weather &s;ets in more inten&s;ely cold than at Chri&s;tmas. The like &s;udden changes frequently happen in September or October; and where no care is taken to guard again&s;t their influence, the gout, rheumati&s;ms, fluxes and fevers often en&s;ue.</P>
<P>LABOURERS frequently &s;uffer by not attending to the changes of the weather. They &s;trip to work while it is warm, but neglect to put on their cloaths when it grows cold; &s;ome are even thoughtle&s;s enough to di&s;regard being wet; &s;uch however, in the end, generally find cau&s;e to re|pent their fool-hardine&s;s.</P>
<P>NOTHING more certainly ob&s;tructs the per&s;piration than WET CLOATHS. Nor is the mo&s;t robu&s;t con&s;titution proof again&s;t their effects. The per&s;piration is not only ob|&s;tructed by wet cloaths, but the moi&s;ture is likewi&s;e ab|&s;orbed, which greatly encrea&s;es the danger.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for people who go abroad, always to avoid being wet. But the danger might generally be le&s;|&s;ened, if not wholely prevented, by changing their cloaths &s;oon; when that cannot be done, they &s;hould keep in mo|tion till they dry. So far are many from ob&s;erving this rule, that they will &s;it, or even lie down in the fields with their cloaths wet, and frequently &s;leep whole nights in that condition. Every per&s;on mu&s;t have known in&s;tances of fevers, rheumati&s;ms, and even con&s;umptions, brought on in this way. Though the&s;e happen daily, yet they are not &s;ufficient to deter others from the like conduct.</P>
<P>EVEN wet feet often occa&s;ion fatal di&s;ea&s;es. Coughs, in|flammations of the brea&s;t, and ulcers in the lungs, frequent|ly proceed from that cau&s;e. The cholic, a fit of the gout, the iliac pa&s;&s;ion, and <HI>cholera morbus,</HI> are likewi&s;e often oc|ca&s;ioned by wet feet. Habit will, no doubt, render this le&s;s dangerous; but it ought, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to be avoided. The delicate, and tho&s;e who are not accu&s;tomed
<PB N="33" REF="012338_0037_0F88EAB72CD1C528">
to have their cloaths or feet wet, &s;hould be peculiarly care|ful in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>THE per&s;piration is often ob&s;tructed by NIGHT-AIR; the ab&s;ence of the &s;un renders it damp and foggy. Even in &s;ummer the night-air ought to be avoided. The dews which fall plentifully after the hotte&s;t day, make the night more dangerous than when the weather is cool. Hence, in warm countries the dews are more hurtful than where the climate is more temperate.</P>
<P>IT is very agreeable indeed, after a warm day, to be abroad in the cool evening; but this is a plea&s;ure to be avoided by all who value their health. The effects of evening dews are gradual and almo&s;t imperceptible; but they are not the le&s;s to be dreaded: We would therefore advi&s;e travellers, labourers, and all who are much heated by day, carefully to avoid them. When the per&s;piration has been great, the&s;e become dangerous in proportion: By not attending to this, in flat mar&s;hy countries, where the exhalations and dews are copious, labourers often catch intermitting fevers, quin&s;ies, and the like.</P>
<P>DAMP BEDS &s;eldom fail to ob&s;truct the per&s;piration. Beds become damp, either from want of u&s;e, &s;tanding in damp hou&s;es, or in rooms without fire. Nothing is more to be dreaded by travellers than damp beds, which are very common in all places where feuel is &s;carce. When a tra|veller cold and wet arrives at an inn, he may by means of a good fire, and a dry bed, have the per&s;piration re&s;tored; but if he be put into a cold room, and laid on a damp bed, it will be more ob&s;tructed, and the wor&s;t con&s;equences mu&s;t en&s;ue. Travellers &s;hould avoid inns which are noted for damp beds, as they would a hou&s;e infected with the plague; as no man, however robu&s;t, is proof again&s;t the danger ari&s;ing from them.</P>
<P>BUT inns are not the only places where damp beds are to be met with. Beds kept in private families for the re|ception of &s;trangers, are no le&s;s dangerous. All kinds of linen and bedding, when not frequently u&s;ed, become damp. How then is it po&s;&s;ible, that beds which are not &s;lept in above two or three times a-year, &s;hould be other|wi&s;e? Nothing is more common than to hear of people having caught cold by changing their bed. The rea&s;on is obvious. Were they careful never to &s;leep on a bed but what was frequently u&s;ed, they would &s;eldom find any ill con&s;equences from a change.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="012338_0038_0F88EABB9E925EC8">
NOTHING is more to be dreaded by a delicate per&s;on, when on a vi&s;it, than being laid in the gue&s;t-chamber. That ill-judged piece of complai&s;ance becomes a real in|jury. All the bad con&s;equences from this quarter might be ea&s;ily prevented in private families, by cau&s;ing their &s;er|vants to &s;leep in the &s;pare beds, and to re&s;ign them to &s;tran|gers when they come. This is the cu&s;tom of many families in London, and we would earne&s;tly recommend it to all who value the health of their friends. In inns where the beds are u&s;ed almo&s;t every night, nothing el&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary than to keep the rooms well &s;ea&s;oned by frequent fires, and the linen dry.</P>
<P>DAMP hou&s;es frequently produce the like ill con&s;e|quences. For this rea&s;on tho&s;e who build, &s;hould be care|ful to chu&s;e a dry &s;ituation. A hou&s;e which &s;tands on a damp mar&s;hy &s;oil, mu&s;t be hurtful to the health of the in|habitants. Not only a mar&s;hy &s;oil, but being &s;ituated in the neighbourhood of large woods, lakes, or &s;tanding wa|ter, mu&s;t make a hou&s;e damp. Large woods both prevent the free current of air, and &s;end forth great quantities of moi&s;t exhalations, which render all places near them un|whole&s;ome. This is one rea&s;on why new di&s;covered coun|tries commonly prove unhealthy, till they be cleared of their woods. Even in England, at this day, there is great|ly more planting in &s;everal parts than is either conducive to the fertility of the &s;oil, or the health of its inhabitants. This ta&s;te, in&s;tead of being any improvement, is the way to reduce the country back to its original &s;tate, and to render the climate le&s;s healthy than it otherwi&s;e would be.</P>
<P>COLD is not near &s;o hurtful to the health as moi&s;ture. Cold, in a moderate degree, braces and &s;trengthens the body; but moi&s;ture relaxes and pre-di&s;po&s;es it to di&s;ea&s;es. That is the rea&s;on why intermittents and other fevers are &s;o frequent in low, damp, mar&s;hy countries abounding with woods and &s;tanding water. This likewi&s;e &s;hews the danger of inhabiting new hou&s;es before they be thoroughly dry. Nothing is more common than for people, merely to avoid &s;ome trifling inconveniency, to hazard their lives, by in|habiting a hou&s;e almo&s;t as &s;oon as the ma&s;ons, plai&s;terers <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have done with it. Such hou&s;es are not only dangerous from their dampne&s;s, but likewi&s;e from the &s;mell of lime, paints, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The a&s;thma's, con&s;umptions, and other di&s;|ea&s;es of the lungs, &s;o common to people who work in the&s;e articles, are a plain proof of their being unwhole&s;ome.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="012338_0039_0F88EABBB21AC070">
HOUSES are often rendered damp by an un&s;ea&s;onable piece of cleanline&s;s, I mean the ridiculous cu&s;tom of wa&s;hing rooms immediately before company is put into them. Many people are &s;ure to catch cold, if they &s;it but a &s;hort while in a room that has been lately wa&s;hed. The delicate ought carefully to avoid &s;uch a &s;ituation, and even the robu&s;t would run le&s;s hazard by &s;itting without doors. People who are accu&s;tomed to live in dry hou&s;es, ought, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to &s;hun damp ones, and by all means not to continue long in rooms that have been lately wa&s;hed.</P>
<P>ALL hou&s;es, unle&s;s where the ground is extremely dry, &s;hould have the fir&s;t floor a little rai&s;ed. Such &s;ervants as are obliged to live for the mo&s;t part in cellars and &s;unk &s;to|ries, &s;eldom continue long in health; and &s;urely ma&s;ters ought to pay &s;ome regard to the health of their &s;ervants as well as to their own.</P>
<P>EVEN hou&s;es which are built for the poor, ought to be dry. The&s;e people generally live on the ground-floor, and if it be damp, they mu&s;t &s;uffer. This is one cau&s;e of the aches, cramps and rheumatic pains, which poor people are &s;o &s;ubject to in the decline of life.</P>
<P>BUT nothing &s;o frequently ob&s;tructs the per&s;piration as SUDDEN TRANSITIONS from heat to cold. Colds are &s;eldom caught, unle&s;s when people have been too much heated. Heat rarifies the blood, quickens the circulation, and in|crea&s;es the per&s;piration; but when the&s;e are &s;uddenly checked, the con&s;equences mu&s;t be bad. It is indeed im|po&s;&s;ible for labourers not to be too hot upon certain occa|&s;ions; but it is generally in their power to put on their cloaths when they leave off work, to make choice of a dry place to re&s;t them&s;elves in, and to avoid falling a&s;leep in the fields. The&s;e ea&s;y rules, if ob&s;erved, would &s;ave many u&s;eful lives.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more common than for people, when hot, to drink freely of cold &s;mall liquors. This conduct is ex|tremely dangerous. Thir&s;t indeed is hard to bear, and the inclination to gratify that appetite, frequently gets the bet|ter of rea&s;on, and makes us do what our judgment di&s;ap|proves. Every pea&s;ant knows, if his hor&s;e be permitted to drink his belly full of cold water after violent exerci&s;e, and be immediately put into the &s;table, or &s;uffered to remain at re&s;t, that it will kill him. This they take the utmo&s;t care to prevent. It were well, if they were equally atten|tive to their own &s;afety.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="012338_0040_0F88EABC6C636B28">
THIRST may be quenched many ways without &s;wallow|ing large quantities of cold liquor. The fields afford variety of acid fruits and plants, the very chewing of which would abate thir&s;t. Water kept in the mouth for &s;ome time, and &s;pit out again, if frequently repeated, will have the &s;ame effect. If a bit of bread be eat along with a few mouth|fuls of water, it will both quench thir&s;t more effectually, and make the danger le&s;s. When a per&s;on is extremely hot, a mouthful of brandy, or other &s;pirits, ought to be preferred to any thing el&s;e, if it can be obtained. But if any one has been &s;o fooli&s;h, when hot, as to drink freely of cold liquor, he ought to continue his exerci&s;e at lea&s;t, till what he drank be thoroughly warmed upon his &s;to|mach.</P>
<P>IT would be tedious to enumerate all the bad effects which flow from drinking cold thin liquors when the body is hot. Sometimes this has occa&s;ioned immediate death. Hoar&s;ene&s;s, quin&s;eys, and fevers of various kinds, are its common con&s;equences. Neither is it &s;afe, when warm, to eat freely of raw fruits, &s;allads, or the like. The&s;e indeed have not &s;o &s;udden an effect on the body as cold liquors, but they are notwith&s;tanding dangerous, and ought to be avoided.</P>
<P>SITTING in a warm room, and drinking hot liquors till the pores are quite open, and immediately going into the cold air, is extremely dangerous. Colds, coughs, and in|flammations of the brea&s;t, are the u&s;ual effects of this conduct: Yet how common is it? Many people, after having drank warm liquors for &s;everal hours, walk or ride a number of miles in the colde&s;t night; while others &s;it up at their bottle all night, or ramble about in the &s;treets. Such conduct is one cau&s;e why coughs and colds are &s;o common in the winter-&s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>PEOPLE are very apt, when a room is hot, to throw open a window, and to &s;it near it. This is a mo&s;t ready way to catch cold. A delicate per&s;on had better &s;it with|out doors than in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as the current of air is directed again&s;t one particular part of the body. Inflam|matory fevers and con&s;umptions have often been occa&s;ioned by &s;itting or &s;tanding thinly cloathed near an open window. Nor is &s;leeping with open windows le&s;s to be dreaded. That ought never to be done even in the hotte&s;t &s;ea&s;on. I have known mechanics frequently contract fatal di&s;ea&s;es, by
<PB N="37" REF="012338_0041_0F88EAC2119B85C8">
working &s;tript at an open window, and would advi&s;e all of them to beware of &s;uch a practice.</P>
<P>NOTHING expo&s;es people more to catch cold than keep|ing their own hou&s;es too warm; &s;uch per&s;ons may be &s;aid to live in a &s;ort of hot-hou&s;es; they can hardly &s;tir abroad to vi&s;it a neighbour, but at the hazard of their lives. Were there no other rea&s;on for keeping hou&s;es in a mode|rate degree of warmth, that alone is &s;ufficient. But no hou&s;e that is too hot, can be whole&s;ome. Heat de&s;troys the &s;pring and ela&s;ticity of the air, and renders it le&s;s fit for expanding the lungs, and other purpo&s;es of re&s;piration. Hence it is, that con&s;umptions and other di&s;ea&s;es of the lungs prove &s;o fatal to people who work in forges, gla&s;s|hou&s;es, and the like.</P>
<P>SOME are even &s;o fool-hardy, as to bathe them&s;elves, when hot, in cold water. Not only fevers, but madne&s;s it&s;elf, has frequently been the effect of this conduct. In|deed it looks too like the action of a madman to de&s;erve a &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall conclude the&s;e ob&s;ervations on the common cau&s;es of catching cold, by recommending it to every one to avoid, with the utmo&s;t attention, all &s;udden tran&s;itions from heat to cold, and to keep the body in as uniform a temperature as po&s;&s;ible; or, where that cannot be done, to take care to cool gradually.</P>
<P>IT may be thought, that too &s;trict an attention to the&s;e things would tend to render people delicate. So far how|ever is this from being our de&s;ign, that the fir&s;t rule laid down for preventing colds, is to harden the body, by enur|ing it daily to bear the open air.</P>
<P>It is a true &s;aying, that colds kill more than plagues. On examining patients, one finds mo&s;t of them impute their di&s;|ea&s;es either to violent colds, or to &s;light ones which had been neglected. This &s;hows the importance of guarding again&s;t every thing that may ob&s;truct the per&s;piration, and likewi&s;e of u&s;ing proper means immediately to remove &s;uch ob&s;truc|tion when it does happen. The want of due attention to the&s;e co&s;ts Britain annually &s;ome thou&s;ands of u&s;eful lives.</P>

<HEAD>UNWHOLESOME FOOD.</HEAD>
<P>AS our bodies con&s;i&s;t of what we eat and drink, un|whole&s;ome food mu&s;t be dangerous. There is no que&s;tion but the whole con&s;titution of body may be changed by
<PB N="38" REF="012338_0042_0F88EAC296CCD290">
diet. This is often done more quickly than people would imagine. A diet con&s;i&s;ting too much of alkaline &s;ub&s;tances will &s;oon render the humours putrid. On the other hand, if acids be u&s;ed too freely, they will receive a taint of an oppo&s;ite nature. The &s;olids may be relaxed or weakened by the u&s;e of oily or watery &s;ub&s;tances, or they may be too much con&s;tricted by eating &s;piceries, au&s;tere vegetables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y to a&s;certain the exact quantity and quality of food proper for every age, &s;ex and con&s;titution: But a &s;crupulous nicety here is by no means nece&s;&s;ary. The be&s;t rule is to avoid all extremes. Mankind were never intend|ed to weigh and mea&s;ure their food. Nature teaches every creature when it has enough of food, and a very &s;mall de|gree of rea&s;on is &s;ufficient for the choice of it. Men &s;el|dom err in this re&s;pect through ignorance. The mo&s;t knowing are generally the mo&s;t guilty.</P>
<P>THOUGH <HI>moderation</HI> be the only rule nece&s;&s;ary with re|&s;pect to the quantity of food, yet the quality of it merits further attention. Many people, if they can &s;atisfy the appetites of hunger and thir&s;t, are very indifferent what they eat or drink. The following ob&s;ervations will &s;how the danger of &s;uch conduct.</P>
<P>PROVISIONS may be rendered unwhole&s;ome various ways. Bad &s;ea&s;ons may either prevent the ripening of grain, or damage it afterwards. Wet and cold &s;ummers &s;eldom bring the fruits of the earth to maturity; and if the harve&s;t like|wi&s;e prove rainy, they are often &s;o damaged as to be very hurtful. The&s;e indeed are acts of Providence; it is there|fore our duty to &s;ubmit to them. But &s;urely no puni&s;hment can be too &s;evere for tho&s;e who &s;uffer provi&s;ions to be &s;poilt, by hoarding them on purpo&s;e to enhance the price. The &s;ounde&s;t grain, if kept too long, mu&s;t become unfit for u&s;e.</P>
<P>THE poor are generally the fir&s;t who &s;uffer by un&s;ound provi&s;ions: But the lives of the labouring poor are of the greate&s;t importance to the &s;tate. Be&s;ides, di&s;ea&s;es occa|&s;ioned by unwhole&s;ome food often prove infectious, and by that means reach people in every &s;tation. The poor judge ill in buying low-priced and coar&s;e provi&s;ions. They had better have a &s;maller quantity of what is &s;ound and good; as that would both afford more nouri&s;hment, and be at|tended with le&s;s danger.</P>
<P>ANIMAL as well as vegetable food becomes unwhole&s;ome when kept too long. All animal &s;ub&s;tances have a con&s;tant tendency to putrefaction, and when that has proceeded too
<PB N="39" REF="012338_0043_0F88EAC32B601488">
far, they not only become offen&s;ive to the &s;en&s;es, but hurt|ful to health. Di&s;ea&s;ed animals, and &s;uch as die of them|&s;elves, ought not to be eaten. It is common enough in gra&s;ing countries for &s;ervants and poor people to eat &s;uch animals as die of any di&s;ea&s;e in the &s;pring or winter, or are killed by accident. I have been frequently told by people who live in places where this is done, that when much fle&s;h of that kind is eaten, it never fails to occa&s;ion fevers.</P>
<P>THE injunctions given to the Jews, not to eat any crea|ture which died of it&s;elf, &s;eem to have a &s;trict regard to health, and ought to be ob&s;erved by Chri&s;tians as well as Jews. Animals never die of them&s;elves without &s;ome pre|vious di&s;ea&s;e; but how a di&s;ea&s;ed animal &s;hould be whole|&s;ome food, is inconceivable. Even tho&s;e which die by ac|cident, mu&s;t be hurtful, as their blood is mixed with the fle&s;h, and &s;oon turns putrid.</P>
<P>ANIMALS which feed gro&s;s, as tame ducks, &s;wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are neither ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, nor afford whole&s;ome nouri&s;h|ment. No animal can be whole&s;ome food which does not take &s;ufficient exerci&s;e. Mo&s;t of our &s;talled cattle, hogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are crammed with gro&s;s food, but not allowed exerci&s;e nor free air, by which means they indeed grow fat, but their humours not being properly prepared or affimulated, they mu&s;t remain crude. The fle&s;h of an animal which has not properly dige&s;ted its own food, can never be ea&s;ily dige&s;ted by another: Yet &s;uch are the delicacies of modern luxury, and &s;uch the animals daily devoured even by the weak and valetudinary. Is it any wonder, that &s;uch &s;hould complain of crudities, indige&s;tions, and oppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;pirits? Let them eat the &s;ame quantity of an animal which runs wild, and they will not feel any load on their &s;tomach, or difficulty of dige&s;tion. We would not have people live on carrion; but &s;urely the oppo&s;ite extreme of eating animals which are gorged with gro&s;s food till they are unfit to live, mu&s;t be as pernicious.</P>
<P>ANIMALS may likewi&s;e be rendered unwhole&s;ome by being over-heated. Heat cau&s;es a fever, exhalts the &s;alts of the animal, and mixes the blood &s;o intimately with the fle&s;h, that it cannot be &s;eperated. For this rea&s;on people ought not to eat freely of &s;uch animals as are hunted down, their fle&s;h being apt to occa&s;ion putrid fevers. But|chers &s;hould al&s;o be careful not to over-drive their cattle. No per&s;on would chu&s;e to eat the fle&s;h of an animal which had died in a high fever; yet that is the ca&s;e with all over|drove
<PB N="40" REF="012338_0044_0F88EAC40C699CC0">
cattle, and the fever is often rai&s;ed even to the degree of madne&s;s.</P>
<P>NO people in the world eat &s;uch quantities of animal food as the Engli&s;h. That is one rea&s;on why they are &s;o generally tainted with the &s;curvy, and its numerous train of con&s;equences, as indige&s;tion, low &s;pirits, hypochon|driaci&s;m, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Animal food was &s;urely de&s;igned for man, and with a proper mixture of vegetables, it will be found the mo&s;t whole&s;ome; but to gorge beef, mutton, pork, fi&s;h and fowl twice or thrice a-day, is certainly too much. All who value health, ought to be contented with making one fle&s;h-meal in the twenty-four hours, and this ought to con&s;i&s;t of one kind only.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t ob&s;tinate &s;curvy has often been cured by a vegetable diet; nay, milk alone will frequently do more in that di&s;ea&s;e than any medicine. From hence it is evi|dent, that if vegetables and milk were more u&s;ed in diet, we &s;hould have le&s;s &s;curvy, and likewi&s;e fewer putrid and inflammatory fevers.</P>
<P>OUR aliment ought neither to be too moi&s;t, nor too dry. Moi&s;t aliment relaxes the &s;olids, and renders the body feeble. Thus we &s;ee females who live much on tea and other watery diet, generally become weak, and unable to dige&s;t &s;olid food; from whence proceed hy&s;terics, and all their dreadful con&s;equences. On the other hand, food that is too dry, renders the &s;olids in a manner rigid, and the humours vi&s;cid, which predi&s;po&s;es the body to inflamma|tory fevers, &s;curvies, and the like.</P>
<P>THE arts of cookery render many things unwhole&s;ome, which are not &s;o in their own nature. By jumbling to|gether a number of different ingredients, in order to make a poignant &s;auce, or rich &s;oup, the compo&s;ition proves al|mo&s;t a poi&s;on. All high-&s;ea&s;oning, pickles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are only incentives to luxury, and never fail to hurt the &s;tomach. It were well for mankind, if cookery, as an art, were in|tirely prohibited. Plain ro&s;ting or boiling is all that nature points out, and all that the &s;tomach requires. The&s;e alone are &s;ufficient for people in health, and the &s;ick have &s;till le&s;s need of a cook.</P>
<P>THE liquid part of our aliment likewi&s;e claims our at|tention. Water is not only the ba&s;is of mo&s;t liquors, but al&s;o compo&s;es a great part of our &s;olid food. Good water mu&s;t therefore be of the greate&s;t importance in diet. The be&s;t water is that which is mo&s;t pure, and free from any
<PB N="41" REF="012338_0045_0F88EAC4B33544A8">
mixture of foreign bodies. Water takes up parts of every body with which it comes in contact; by which means it is often impregnated with metals and minerals of a hurtful or poi&s;onous nature.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of &s;ome hilly countries have peculiar di&s;ea&s;es, which in all probability proceed from the water. Thus the people who live near the Alps in Switzerland, and the inhabitants of the Peak of Derby in England, have large tumours or wains on their necks. This di&s;ea&s;e is generally imputed to the &s;now-water; but there is more rea&s;on to believe it is owing to the minerals in the moun|tains through which the waters pa&s;s. Were it owing to the &s;now-water, it &s;hould happen to the inhabitants of all mountainous countries, where &s;now lies long; but there are many parts of Britain where the &s;now lies much longer than in the Peak of Derby; yet the inhabitants have no &s;uch di&s;ea&s;e. The Peak of Derby is well known to be a bed of minerals of different kinds; and, as far as what is called the mineral country extends, the&s;e tumours are com|mon, and generally go by the name of <HI>Derby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN water is impregnated with foreign bodies, it ge|nerally appears by its weight, colour, ta&s;te, &s;mell, heat, or &s;ome other &s;en&s;ible quality. Our bu&s;ine&s;s therefore is to chu&s;e &s;uch water, for common u&s;e, as is lighte&s;t, and without any particular colour, ta&s;te or &s;mell. In mo&s;t places of Britain the inhabitants have it in their power to make choice of their water, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew things would contri|bute more to health than a due attention to this article. But mere indolence often induces people to make u&s;e of the water that is neare&s;t them, without con&s;idering its qualities.</P>
<P>BEFORE water be brought into great towns, the &s;tricte&s;t attention ought to be paid to it's qualities, as epidemic di&s;|tempers are often occa&s;ioned by bad water; and when it has been procured at a great expence, we are unwilling to give it up.</P>
<P>THE common methods of rendering water clear by fil|tration, of &s;oft by expo&s;ing it to the &s;un and air, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are &s;o generally known, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;pend time in explaining them. We &s;hall only in general advi&s;e all to avoid waters which &s;tagnate long in &s;mall lakes, ponds, or the like. Such waters often become putrid with in&s;ects and other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, which breed and die in them. Even cattle frequently &s;uffer by drinking, in dry &s;ea&s;ons, water which
<PB N="42" REF="012338_0046_0F88EACB1775A550">
has &s;tood long in &s;mall re&s;ervoirs, without being &s;upplied by &s;prings, or fre&s;hened with &s;howers. All wells ought to be kept clean, and to have a free communication with the air. When either animal or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances are &s;uf|fered to lie at the bottom of wells, they corrupt and taint the water. Even the air it&s;elf, when confined in wells, becomes poi&s;onous, and mu&s;t of cour&s;e render the water unwhole&s;ome.</P>
<P>MUCH noi&s;e has been made about the u&s;e of fermented liquors. They notwith&s;tanding &s;till continue to be the common drink of almo&s;t every per&s;on who can afford them. As this is, and in all probability will be the ca&s;e, we &s;hall rather endeavour to a&s;&s;i&s;t people in their choice of the&s;e liquors, than pretend to condemn what cu&s;tom has e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. It is not the moderate u&s;e of &s;ound fermented liquors which hurts mankind; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> is exce&s;s, or the abu&s;e of them, and u&s;ing &s;uch as are ill-prepared or vitiated.</P>
<P>FERMENTED liquors which are too &s;trong hurt dige&s;tion, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting it, by which means their intention is lo&s;t, and the body, in place of being &s;trengthened by them, is weakened and relaxed. Many imagine, that hard labour could not be &s;upported without drinking &s;trong liquors: This, though a common, is a very erroneous notion. Men who never ta&s;te &s;trong liquors, are not only able to endure more fatigue, but al&s;o live much longer than tho&s;e who u&s;e them daily. But &s;uppo&s;e &s;trong liquors did enable men to do more work, they mu&s;t neverthele&s;s wa&s;te the powers of life, and of cour&s;e occa&s;ion premature old age. They keep up a con&s;tant fever, which wa&s;tes the &s;pirits, heats and inflames the blood, and predi&s;po&s;es the body to number|le&s;s di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT fermented liquors may be too weak as well as too &s;trong: When that is the ca&s;e, they mu&s;t either be drank new, or they become &s;our and dead. When &s;uch liquors are drank new, the fermentation not being over, they ge|nerate air in the bowels, and occa&s;ion flatulencies; and when kept till &s;tale, they &s;our on the &s;tomach, and greatly hurt dige&s;tion. For this rea&s;on all malt-liquor, cyder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ought to be of &s;uch &s;trength as will make them keep till they be ripe, and then they &s;hould be u&s;ed. When &s;uch liquors are kept too long, though they &s;hould not become &s;our, yet they generally contract a hardne&s;s, which renders them unwhole&s;ome. Hence it is, that bottled ale hurts the &s;tomach, occa&s;ions the gravel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

ALL families, who can, ought to prepare their own li|quors. Since preparing and vending of liquors became one of the mo&s;t general branches of bu&s;ine&s;s, every me|thod has been tried to adulterate them. The great object both of the makers and venders of liquor is, to render it intoxicating. But it is well known, that this may be done by other ingredients than tho&s;e which ought to be u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e. It would be imprudent even to name tho&s;e things which are daily made u&s;e of to render liquors heady. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the practice is very common, and all the ingredients u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, are of an opiate or &s;tupifactive nature. But as all opiates are of a poi&s;onous quality, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee what mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of their general u&s;e. Though they do not kill &s;uddenly, yet they hurt the nerves, relax and weaken the &s;tomach, and of cour&s;e &s;poil the dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>WERE fermented liquors faithfully prepared, not too &s;trong, nor too weak, kept to a proper age, and u&s;ed in moderation, they would prove real ble&s;&s;ings to mankind. But while they are ill prepared, various ways adulterated, and taken to exce&s;s, they mu&s;t have many bad con&s;equences. The&s;e however we &s;hall not mention at pre&s;ent, as they will be pointed out under another article.</P>
<P>TO &s;pecify the different kinds of aliment, to explain their nature and properties, and to point out their effects in different con&s;titutions, would far exceed the limits of our de&s;ign.

<P>THOSE who&s;e &s;olids are weak and relaxed, ought to avoid all vi&s;cid food, or &s;uch things as are hard of dige&s;tion; and to take plenty of exerci&s;e in a dry open air.</P>
<P>SUCH as abound with blood, &s;hould be &s;paring in the u&s;e of every thing that is highly nouri&s;hing, as fat meat, rich wines, &s;trong ale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Their food &s;hould con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of bread and other vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, and their drink ought to be milk, whey, and the like.</P>
<P>FAT people &s;hould not eat freely of oily nouri&s;hing diet. They ought frequently to u&s;e raddi&s;h, garlic, &s;pices, or &s;uch things as are heating, and promote per|&s;piration and urine. Their drink &s;hould be water, coffee, tea, or the like; and they ought to take much exerci&s;e and little &s;leep.</P>

<P>PEOPLE who are affected with the gout, low &s;pirits, hy|pochondriac or hy&s;teric di&s;orders, ought to avoid all flatu|lent food, every thing that is vi&s;cid or hard of dige&s;tion, all &s;alted or &s;moke-dried provi&s;ions, and whatever is au|&s;tere, acid, or apt to &s;our on the &s;tomach. Their food &s;hould be light, &s;pare, cool, and of an opening quality.</P>
<P>THE diet ought not only to be &s;uited to the age and con|&s;titution, but al&s;o to the manner of life. A &s;edentary or &s;tudious per&s;on &s;hould live more &s;paringly than one who labours hard without doors. Food will nouri&s;h a pea&s;ant very well, which would be almo&s;t indige&s;tible to a citizen; and the latter will live upon a diet on which the former would &s;tarve.</P>
<P>DIET ought not to be too uniform. The con&s;tant u&s;e of one kind of food might have bad effects. Nature points out this by the great variety of aliments which &s;he has pro|vided for man, and likewi&s;e by giving him an appetite for different kinds of food.</P>
<P>THOSE who labour under any particular di&s;ea&s;e, ought to avoid &s;uch aliments as have a tendency to increa&s;e it. For example, a gouty per&s;on &s;hould not u&s;e rich wines, &s;trong &s;oups, or gravies, and &s;hould avoid all acids. One who is troubled with the gravel, ought to &s;hun all au&s;tere and a&s;tringent aliments; and tho&s;e who are &s;corbutic, &s;hould not indulge in animal food, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t period of life our food ought to be light, nouri&s;hing, and of a diluting nature, but frequently u&s;ed. Food that is &s;olid, with a &s;ufficient degree of tenacity, is mo&s;t proper for the &s;tate of manhood. The diet &s;uited to the la&s;t period of life, when nature is upon the decline, approaches near to that of the fir&s;t. It &s;hould be lighter, and more diluting than that of vigorous age, and likewi&s;e more frequently taken.</P>

<HEAD>IRREGULARITIES IN DIET, SLEEP, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not only nece&s;&s;ary for health, that our diet be whole&s;ome, but al&s;o that it be taken at regular periods.
<PB N="45" REF="012338_0049_0F88ED8BEEC13148">
Some imagine, that long fa&s;ting will atone for exce&s;s; but that, in&s;tead of mending the matter, never fails to make it wor&s;e. When the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines are over di&s;|tended with food, they lo&s;e their proper tone, and by long fa&s;ting they become weak, and inflated with wind. Thus either gluttony or fa&s;ting de&s;troys the powers of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>THE frequent repetition of aliment is not only nece&s;&s;ary for repairing the continual wa&s;te of our bodies, but like|wi&s;e to keep the humours &s;ound and &s;weet. Our humours, even in the mo&s;t healthy &s;tate, have a con&s;tant tendency to become putrid, which can only be prevented by frequent &s;upplies of fre&s;h nouri&s;hment: When that is wanting too long, the putrefaction often proceeds &s;o far, as to occa&s;ion very dangerous fevers. From hence we may learn the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of regular meals. No per&s;on can enjoy a good &s;tate of health, who&s;e ve&s;&s;els are either frequently over|charged, or the humours long deprived of fre&s;h &s;upplies of chyle.</P>
<P>LONG fa&s;ting is extremely hurtful to young people; it vitiates their humours, and prevents their growth and &s;trength. Nor is it le&s;s injurious to the aged. Many in the decline of life are afflicted with wind: That com|plaint is not only increa&s;ed, but even rendered dangerous, and often fatal, by long fa&s;ting. Old people, when their &s;tomachs are empty, are frequently &s;eized with giddine&s;s, headachs and faintne&s;s. The&s;e complaints may generally be removed by a bit of bread and a gla&s;s of wine, or taking any other &s;olid food; which plainly points out the method of preventing them. It is more than probable, that many of the &s;udden deaths which happen in the advanced periods of life, are occa&s;ioned by fa&s;ting too long, as it exhau&s;ts the &s;pirits, and fills the bowels with wind; we would therefore advi&s;e people, in the decline of life, never to al|low their &s;tomachs to be too long empty. Many take no|thing but a few cups of tea and a bit of bread, from nine o'clock at night till two or three next afternoon. Such may be &s;aid to fa&s;t almo&s;t three fourths of their time. This can hardly fail to ruin the appetite, vitiate the humours, and fill the bowels with wind; all which might be pre|vented by a &s;olid breakfa&s;t. That would tend more to &s;trengthen the nerves, and expel wind, than all the cor|dial or carminative medicines which can be admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>THE &s;trong and healthy do not indeed &s;uffer &s;o much from fa&s;ting as the weak and delicate; but they run great

hazard from its oppo&s;ite, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> repletion, Many di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecially fevers, are the effect of a plethora, or too great fulne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els. Strong people, in high health, have generally a great quantity of blood and other humours. When the&s;e are &s;uddenly increa&s;ed by an overcharge of rich and nouri&s;hing diet, the ve&s;&s;els become di&s;tended, and being unable to contract them&s;elves, ob&s;tructions and in|flammations en&s;ue. Hence &s;o many people are &s;eized with inflammatory and eruptive fevers, after a fea&s;t or debauch. This &s;hows the danger of all &s;udden tran&s;itions from a &s;pare to a full and luxurious diet.</P>
<P>EXCESS in diet is not peculiar to the rich and opulent; the poor are often guilty of it, and frequently feel its bad effects. The poor &s;eldom lo&s;e an opportunity of gorging them&s;elves either with meat or drink, when they can obtain it, and the le&s;s they are accu&s;tomed to it, the danger is the greater.</P>
<P>WHEN we recommend regularity in diet, we would not be under&s;tood as condemning every &s;mall deviation from it. It is next to impo&s;&s;ible for people at all times to avoid &s;ome degree to exce&s;s, and living too much by rule might make even the &s;malle&s;t deviation dangerous. It may therefore be prudent to vary a little, &s;ometimes taking more, &s;ometimes le&s;s than the u&s;ual quantity of meat and drink, provided al|ways that regard be had to moderation.</P>
<P>SLEEP as well as diet ought to be duly regulated. Too little &s;leep exhau&s;ts the &s;pirits, weakens the nerves, and oc|ca&s;ions di&s;ea&s;es; and too much renders the mind dull, the body gro&s;s, and di&s;po&s;es it to apoplexies, lethargies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A medium therefore ought to be ob&s;erved; but that is not ea&s;y to fix. The you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g require more &s;leep than tho&s;e who are grown, the laborious than the idle, and &s;uch as eat and drink freely than tho&s;e who live ab&s;temiou&s;ly. Be&s;ides, the real quantity of &s;leep cannot be mea&s;ured by time; as one per|&s;on will be more refre&s;hed by five or &s;ix hours of &s;leep, than another by eight or ten. The be&s;t way to make &s;leep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound and refre&s;hing is to ri&s;e by times. The indolent cu&s;tom of lolling a-bed for nine or ten hours relaxes the body, un|braces the nerves, and greatly hurts the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>CHILDREN may be allowed as much &s;leep as they chu&s;e; but for adults &s;ix or &s;even hours is certainly enough, and none ought to exceed eight. Tho&s;e who lie more than eight hours a-bed may &s;lumber, but they can hardly be &s;aid to &s;leep; &s;uch generally to&s;s and dream away the fore-part of the night, &s;ink to re&s;t towards morning, and do&s;e till
<PB N="47" REF="012338_0051_0F88ED8D2B152108">
noon. In&s;tead of encouraging a habit of this kind, ri&s;ing early would make them fall into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound &s;leep as &s;oon as they went to bed, and they would &s;eldom wake till morn|ing, when they would find them&s;elves &s;ufficiently refre&s;hed.</P>
<P>NATURE points out night as the proper time for &s;leep. Tho&s;e who think it too vulgar to &s;leep in that &s;ea&s;on, &s;eldom enjoy health. Nothing more certainly de&s;troys the con|&s;titution than night-watching. It is great pity that a prac|tice &s;o de&s;tructive to health &s;hould be &s;o much in fa&s;hion. How quickly the want of re&s;t in due &s;ea&s;on will bla&s;t the mo&s;t blooming complexion, or ruin the be&s;t con&s;titution, is evident from the gha&s;tly countenances of tho&s;e who, as the phra&s;e is, turn day into night, and night into day.</P>
<P>TO make &s;leep refre&s;hing, the following things are ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Fir&s;t, that we take enough of exerci&s;e in the open air, through the day; next, to eat a light &s;upper; and la&s;t|ly, to lie down with a mind chearful and &s;erene.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that too much fatigue will prevent &s;leep, as well as too little. We &s;eldom, however, hear the active and laborious complain of re&s;tle&s;s nights. It is the indolent and &s;lothful who generally have the&s;e complaints. Is it any wonder, that a bed of down &s;hould not be refre&s;hing to a per&s;on who lolls all day in an ea&s;y chair? A great part of the plea&s;ure of life con&s;i&s;ts in alternate re&s;t and motion; but they who neglect the latter can never reli&s;h the former. The labourer enjoys more true luxury in plain food and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound &s;leep, than is to be found in &s;umptuous tables and downy pillows, where exerci&s;e is wanting.</P>
<P>THAT light &s;uppers cau&s;e &s;ound &s;leep, is true even to a proverb. Many, if they exceed the lea&s;t at that meal, are &s;ure to have unea&s;y nights; and if they drop a&s;leep, the load and oppre&s;&s;ion on their &s;tomach and &s;pirits occa&s;ion frightful dreams, broken and di&s;turbed repo&s;e, with night|mares, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Were the &s;ame per&s;ons to go to bed with a light &s;upper, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it up till what they eat were pretty well dige&s;ted they might enjoy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound &s;leep, and ri&s;e refre&s;hed and chearful.</P>
<P>NOTHING more certainly di&s;turbs our repo&s;e than anxie|ty. When the mind is not at ea&s;e, we &s;eldom enjoy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound &s;leep. That greate&s;t of human ble&s;&s;ings often flies the wretch who needs it mo&s;t, and vi&s;its the happy, the chear|ful, and the gay. This is a good rea&s;on why every man &s;hould endeavour to be as ea&s;y in his mind as po&s;&s;ible, when he goes to re&s;t. Many, by neglecting this rule, and by in|dulging
<PB N="48" REF="012338_0052_0F88ED8DFA149760">
grief and anxious thoughts, have bani&s;hed &s;leep &s;o long, that they could never afterwards enjoy it.</P>
<P>FEW things contribute more to health than keeping the belly regular. When the foeces lie too long in the bowels, they become acrid, and &s;poil the humours; and when they are di&s;charged too &s;oon, the body is not properly nouri&s;hed. Regular &s;tools depend greatly upon regularity in eating and drinking, and proper exerci&s;e; people have rea&s;on to &s;u|&s;pect a fault in one or other of the&s;e, whenever the belly is not regular.</P>
<P>TO prevent co&s;tivene&s;s, one good rule is, to ri&s;e betimes and go abroad in the open air. Not only the po&s;ture in bed is unfavourable to regular &s;tools, but likewi&s;e the warmth. This, by promoting the per&s;piration, cannot fail to le&s;&s;en all the other di&s;charges. Mr. Lock's advice, to &s;olicit na|ture by going regularly to &s;tool every morning, is a very good one, and has more effect than mo&s;t people would ima|gine. Any habit will in time become natural. It is always more &s;afe to keep the belly regular by proper diet, exerci&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than by the u&s;e of drugs. Tho&s;e who have frequent recour&s;e to medicine for that purpo&s;e, &s;eldom fail to ruin their con&s;titutions. But if opening medicines mu&s;t be u&s;ed, the &s;afe&s;t is fine rhubarb, which may either be taken in &s;mall do&s;es in powder, or a little of it chewed daily. Cu&s;|tom will render this &s;ufficiently agreeable.</P>
<P>SUCH as are troubled with habitual loo&s;ene&s;s, ought to &s;uit their food to the nature of their complaint. Loo&s;ene&s;s may often be removed by a change of diet: For example, boiled milk may be u&s;ed in place of raw, wheat bread in|&s;tead of that which is mixed, red wine, or brandy and wa|ter may be drank in place of malt-liquor, white broths may be eat in&s;tead of fle&s;h, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or &s;ago gruels, with light flour puddings, in place of barley or oat meal. An habitual loo&s;ene&s;s is often occa&s;ioned by an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration. In that ca&s;e as flannel ve&s;t and thick &s;hoes are the be&s;t me|dicines.</P>

<HEAD>BAD AIR.</HEAD>
<P>BAD air is a very common cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;es. Few are aware of the danger ari&s;ing from it; people generally pay &s;ome attention to what they eat and drink, but &s;eldom re|gard what goes into the lungs, though the one often proves fatal as well as the other.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="012338_0053_0F88ED8EE5E8E908">
PERHAPS no air is perfectly pure; that, however, which has fewe&s;t noxious particles in it, is no doubt the be&s;t. Air as well as water takes up parts of mo&s;t bodies with which it comes into contact, and is often &s;o repleni&s;hed with tho&s;e of a noxious quality, as to occa&s;ion immediate death. But &s;uch violent effects &s;eldom happen, as people are generally on their guard again&s;t them. The le&s;s perceptible influ|ences of bad air prove more hurtful to mankind; we &s;hall therefore endeavour to point out &s;ome of the&s;e, and to &s;how wherein the danger con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>AIR may become noxious many ways. Whatever de&s;troys its &s;pring or ela&s;ticity, renders it unfit for re&s;piration: Wherever therefore great numbers of people are crowded into one place, if the air has not a free current, it &s;oon be|comes unwhole&s;ome. Hence it is that delicate per&s;ons are &s;o apt to faint or be &s;ick, in crowded churches, a&s;&s;emblies, or any place where the air is exhau&s;ted by breathing, fires, candles, or the like.</P>
<P>IN great cities &s;o many things tend to pollute the air, that it is no wonder it proves &s;o fatal to the inhabitants. The air in cities is not only breathed over and over by thou|&s;ands, but is likewi&s;e exhau&s;ted by fires, loaded with &s;ul|phur, &s;moke, and other exhalations, be&s;ides the vapours continually ari&s;ing from innumerable putrid &s;ub&s;tances. All po&s;&s;ible care &s;hould be taken to keep the &s;treets of large towns open and wide, that the air may have a free current. They ought likewi&s;e to be kept very clean. Nothing tends more to pollute and contaminate the air than dirty &s;treets, dunghills, &s;laughter-hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IT is very common in this country to have church-yards in the middle of populous cities. Whether that be the ef|fect of ancient &s;uper&s;tition, or owing to the increa&s;e of &s;uch towns, is a matter of no con&s;equence. Whatever gave ri&s;e to the cu&s;tom, it is a bad one. It is habit alone which re|conciles us to the&s;e things; by means of it, the mo&s;t ridi|culous, nay, pernicious cu&s;toms, often become &s;acred. Cer|tain it is, that thou&s;ands of putrid carca&s;es, &s;o near the &s;ur|face of the earth, in a place where the air &s;tagnates, cannot fail to taint it; and that &s;uch air being breathed into the lungs, and mixed with the blood, mu&s;t occa&s;ion di&s;ea&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In mo&s;t ea&s;tern countries it is cu&s;tomary to bury the dead at &s;ome di&s;tance from any town. It were to be wi&s;hed the inhabitants of Europe would follow this example.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEREVER air &s;tagnates long, it becomes unwhole&s;ome. Hence the unhappy inmates of jails not only contract ma|lignant
<PB N="50" REF="012338_0054_0F88ED92C6C60DF8">
fevers them&s;elves, but often communicate them to others. Nor are many of the holes, for we cannot call them hou&s;es, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the poor in great towns, much better than jails. The&s;e low dirty habitations are the very lurk|ing places of bad air and contagious di&s;ea&s;es. Such as live in them &s;eldom enjoy good health; and their children com|monly die young. In the choice of a hou&s;e, the greate&s;t at|tention ought always to be paid to free air.</P>
<P>THE various methods which luxury has invented to make hou&s;es clo&s;e and warm, contribute not a little to render them unwhole&s;ome. No hou&s;e can be whole&s;ome unle&s;s the air has a free pa&s;&s;age through it. For which rea&s;on, hou&s;es ought daily to be ventilated by opening oppo&s;ite win|dows, and admitting a current of fre&s;h air into every room. This would expel any noxious vapour, and could not fail to promote the health of the inhabitants. In ho&s;pitals, jails, &s;hips, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where that cannot be conveniently done, venti|lators &s;hould be u&s;ed. The method of expelling foul, and introducing fre&s;h air, by means of ventilators, is a mo&s;t &s;a|lutary invention, and is indeed the mo&s;t u&s;eful of all our modern medical improvements. We wi&s;h, for the benefit of mankind, it were more generally regarded. It is capable of univer&s;al application, and fraught with numerous advan|tages, both to tho&s;e in health and &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>AIR not only lo&s;es its &s;pring, and becomes unwhole&s;ome from heat and &s;tagnation, but likewi&s;e from moi&s;ture. Thus, in low mar&s;hy countries, the air is generally bad, as al&s;o in countries over-run with wood, or any thing that &s;ends forth moi&s;t exhalations.</P>
<P>AIR that &s;tagnates in mines, wells, cellars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t be noxious. That kind of air is to be avoided as the mo&s;t deadly poi&s;on. It often kills almo&s;t as quick as lightening. For this rea&s;on, people &s;hould be very cautious in opening cellars that have been long &s;hut, or going down into deep wells, e&s;pecially if they have been clo&s;e covered.</P>
<P>MANY people who have &s;plendid hou&s;es, chu&s;e to &s;leep in &s;mall apartments. This conduct is very imprudent. A bed-chamber ought always to be well aired; as it is gene|rally occupied in the night only, when all doors and win|dows are &s;hut. If a fire be kept in it, the danger becomes &s;till greater. Many have been &s;tifled when a&s;leep by a fire in a &s;mall apartment. Some are even &s;o incon&s;iderate as to make fires in bed-chambers which have no chimneys, and imagine by u&s;ing that kind of coal which has little or no
<PB N="51" REF="012338_0055_0F88ED946756A5F0">
&s;moke, that they are &s;afe; whereas the danger becomes thereby the greater, &s;uch coal generally abounding with &s;ulphur. The mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences are always to be dreaded from every attempt of this nature.</P>
<P>THOSE who are obliged, on account of bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;pend the day in clo&s;e towns, ought, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;leep in the country. Breathing good air in the night will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, make up for the want of it through the day. This practice would have a greater effect in pre&s;erving the health of citizens than is commonly imagined.</P>
<P>CARE &s;hould be taken to admit a con&s;tant &s;tream of fre&s;h air into all crowded places, as churches, a&s;&s;embly-rooms, colleges, courts of ju&s;tice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The neglect of this has had &s;o many fatal con&s;equences, that it is &s;ufficient only to men|tion it.</P>
<P>IT was nece&s;&s;ary in former times, for &s;afety, to &s;urround cities, colleges, and even &s;ingle hou&s;es, with high walls. The&s;e, by ob&s;tructing the current of air, never fail to ren|der &s;uch places damp and unwhole&s;ome. As &s;uch walls are now, generally &s;peaking, become u&s;ele&s;s, they ought to be thrown down, and every method taken to admit a free pa&s;|&s;age to the air. Were proper attention paid to AIR and CLEANLINESS, it would tend more to pre&s;erve the health of the inhabitants of great towns than all the endeavours of the Faculty.</P>
<P>IF fre&s;h air be nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e in health, it is &s;till more &s;o for the &s;ick, who often lo&s;e their lives for the want of it. The notion that &s;ick people mu&s;t be kept very hot, is &s;o common, that one can hardly enter the chamber where a patient lies, without being ready to faint, by rea&s;on of the hot &s;uffocating &s;mell. How this mu&s;t affect the &s;ick, any one may judge. No medicine is &s;o beneficial to the &s;ick as fre&s;h air. It is the mo&s;t reviving of all cordials, if it be ad|mini&s;tred with prudence. We are not, however, to throw open doors and windows at random upon the &s;ick. Fre&s;h air is to be let into the chamber gradually, and, if po&s;&s;ible, by opening the windows of &s;ome other apartment.</P>
<P>THE air of a &s;ick per&s;on's chamber may be greatly fre&s;h|ened, and the patient much revived, by &s;prinkling the floor, bed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> frequently with vinegar, juice of lemon, or any other &s;trong vegetable acid.</P>
<P>IN places where numbers of &s;ick are crowded into the &s;ame hou&s;e, or, which is often the ca&s;e, into the &s;ame apart|ment, fre&s;h air becomes ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Infirmaries,

ho&s;pitals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> often become &s;o noxious for want of proper ventilation, that the &s;ick run more hazard from them than from the di&s;ea&s;e; this is particularly the ca&s;e when dy&s;en|teries, putrid fevers, or other infectious di&s;ea&s;es prevail.</P>
<P>PHYSICIANS, &s;urgeons, and others who attend ho&s;pitals, ought, for their own &s;ake, to take care that they be proper|ly ventilated. They are obliged to &s;pend much of their time among&s;t the &s;ick, and run great hazard of being them|&s;elves infected when the air is bad. All ho&s;pitals, and places for the &s;ick, ought to have an open &s;ituation, at &s;ome di&s;|tance from any great town.</P>

<HEAD>WANT OF CLEANLINESS.</HEAD>
<P>THE want of cleanline&s;s is a fault which admits of no excu&s;e. Where water can be had for nothing, it is &s;urely in the power of every per&s;on to be clean. The continual di&s;|charge from our bodies by per&s;piration renders frequent changes of apparel nece&s;&s;ary. Change of apparel greatly pro|motes the &s;ecretion from the &s;kin, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for health. When that matter which ought to be carried off by per&s;pi|ration, is either retained in the body, or re-ab&s;orbed from dirty cloaths, it is apt to occa&s;ion fevers and other di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>MOST di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;kin proceed from want of cleanli|ne&s;s: The&s;e indeed may be caught by infection; but they will &s;eldom continue long where cleanline&s;s prevails.

Perhaps, the in|tention of nature in permitting &s;uch vermine to annoy man|kind, is to induce them to the practice of this virtue.</P>
<P>ONE common cau&s;e of putrid and malignant fevers is the want of cleanline&s;s. The&s;e fevers commonly begin among the inhabitants of clo&s;e, dirty hou&s;es, who breathe bad air, take little exerci&s;e, u&s;e unwhole&s;ome food, and wear dirty cloaths. There the infection is generally hatched, which often &s;preads far and wide, to the de&s;truction of many. Hence cleanline&s;s may be con&s;idered as an object of public attention. It is not &s;ufficient that I be clean my&s;elf, while the want of it in my neighbour affects my health as well as his own. If dirty people cannot be removed as a common nui&s;ance, they ought at lea&s;t to be avoided as infectious. All who regard their health &s;hould keep at a di&s;tance even from their habitations.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="012338_0057_0F88ED9632CEED70">
IN places where great numbers of people are collected, cleanline&s;s becomes of the utmo&s;t importance. It is well known, that infectious di&s;ea&s;es are communicated by taint|ed air. Every thing, therefore, which tends to pollute the air, or &s;pread the infection, ought, with the utmo&s;t care, to be avoided. For this rea&s;on, in great towns, no filth of any kind &s;hould be permitted to lie upon the &s;treets. Nothing is more apt to convey infection than the excrements of the di&s;ea&s;ed. The&s;e, in many ca&s;es, are known to be highly in|fectious. The &s;treets in many great towns are little better than dunghills, being frequently covered with a&s;hes and na&s;tine&s;s of every kind. How ea&s;ily might this be prevented by active magi&s;trates, who have it always in their power to make proper laws relative to things of this nature, and to enforce the ob&s;ervance of them?</P>
<P>WE are &s;orry to &s;ay, that the importance of general clean|line&s;s does by no means &s;eem to be &s;ufficiently under&s;tood. It were well if the inhabitants of Britain would imitate their neighbours the Dutch in the cleanne&s;s of their &s;treets, hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Water, indeed, is ea&s;ily obtained in Holland; but the &s;ituation of mo&s;t towns in Britain is more favourable to cleanline&s;s. Nothing can be more agreeable to the &s;en&s;es, more to the honour of the inhabitants, or conducive to their health, than a clean town; nor does any thing impre&s;s a &s;tranger &s;ooner with a di&s;re&s;pectful idea of any people than its oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P>THE pea&s;ants in mo&s;t countries &s;eem to hold cleanline&s;s in a &s;ort of contempt. Were it not for the open &s;ituation of their hou&s;es, they would often feel the bad effects of this di&s;po&s;ition. One &s;eldom &s;ees a farm-hou&s;e without a dung|hill before the door, and frequently the cattle and their ma&s;|ters lodge under the &s;ame roof. Pea&s;ants are likewi&s;e ex|tremely carele&s;s with re&s;pect to change of apparel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> keeping their &s;kins clean, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e are merely the effects of indo|lence and a dirty di&s;po&s;ition. Habit may indeed render them le&s;s di&s;agreeable; but no habit can ever make it &s;alutary to wear dirty cloaths, or breathe unwhole&s;ome air.</P>
<P>IN camps the &s;tricte&s;t regard &s;hould be paid to cleanline&s;s. By negligence in this matter, infectious di&s;ea&s;es are often &s;pread among&s;t a whole army; and frequently more die of the&s;e than by the &s;word. The Jews, during their encamp|ments in the wilderne&s;s, received particular in&s;tructions with
<PB N="54" REF="012338_0058_0F88ED96ECA11838">
re&s;pect to cleanline&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thou &s;halt have a place al&s;o without the camp, whither thou &s;halt go forth abroad; and thou &s;halt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it &s;hall be, when thou &s;halt ea&s;e thy&s;elf abroad, thou &s;halt dig therewith, and &s;halt turn back, and cover that which cometh from thee, <HI>&amp;c. Deuter.</HI> chap. xxiii. ver. 12. 13.</NOTE> The rules enjoined them ought to be ob&s;erved by all in the like &s;ituation. Indeed the whole &s;y&s;tem of laws delivered to that people, has a manife&s;t ten|dency to promote cleanline&s;s. Whoever con&s;iders the na|ture of their climate, and the di&s;ea&s;es to which they were liable, will &s;ee the propriety of &s;uch laws.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that in mo&s;t ea&s;tern countries clean|line&s;s makes a great part of their religion. The Maho|metan, as well as the Jewi&s;h religion, enjoins various ba|things, wa&s;hings and purifications. No doubt the&s;e were de&s;igned to repre&s;ent inward purity; but they are at the &s;ame time calculated for the pre&s;ervation of health. How|ever whim&s;ical the&s;e wa&s;hings may appear to &s;ome, few things would tend more to prevent di&s;ea&s;es than a proper attention to many of them. Were every per&s;on, for ex|ample, after handling a dead body, vi&s;iting the &s;ick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to wa&s;h before he went into company, or &s;at down to meat, he would run le&s;s hazard either of catching the infection him&s;elf, or communicating it to others.</P>
<P>FREQUENT wa&s;hing not only removes the filth and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ordes which adhere to the &s;kin, but likewi&s;e promotes the per|&s;piration, braces the body, and enlivens the &s;pirits. Even wa&s;hing the feet tends greatly to pre&s;erve health. The &s;weat and dirt with which the&s;e parts are frequently co|vered, cannot fail to ob&s;truct the per&s;piration. This piece of cleanline&s;s would often prevent colds and fevers. Were people careful to bathe their feet and hands in warm water at night, after being expo&s;ed to cold or wet through the day, they would &s;eldom experience any of the fatal effects which often proceed from the&s;e cau&s;es.</P>
<P>A proper attention to cleanline&s;s is no where more ne|ce&s;&s;ary than on &s;hipboard. If epidemical di&s;tempers break out there, no one can be &s;afe. The be&s;t way to prevent them is to take care that the whole company be cleanly in their cloaths, diet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When infectious di&s;ea&s;es do break out, cleanline&s;s is the mo&s;t likely means to prevent their &s;preading. Above all things, the cloaths, bedding, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the &s;ick ought to be carefully wa&s;hed, and fumigated with brim&s;tone, or the like. Infection will lodge a long
<PB N="55" REF="012338_0059_0F88ED97D6CDE7E8">
time in dirty cloaths, and will afterwards break out in the mo&s;t terrible manner.</P>
<P>IN places where great numbers of &s;ick people are kept, cleanline&s;s ought mo&s;t religiou&s;ly to be ob&s;erved. The very &s;mell in &s;uch places is often &s;ufficient to make one &s;ick. It is ea&s;y to imagine what effect that is likely to have upon the di&s;ea&s;ed. A per&s;on in perfect health has a greater chance to become &s;ick, than a &s;ick per&s;on has to get well, in an ho&s;pital or infirmary, where cleanline&s;s is neglected.</P>
<P>THE brutes them&s;elves &s;et us an example of cleanline&s;s. Mo&s;t of them &s;eem unea&s;y, and thrive ill, if they be not kept clean. A hor&s;e that is kept thoroughly clean, will thrive better on a &s;maller quantity of food, than with a greater, where cleanline&s;s is neglected. Even our own feelings are a &s;ufficient proof of the nece&s;&s;ity of cleanli|ne&s;s. How refre&s;hed, how chearful and agreeable does one feel on being &s;haved, wa&s;hed and dre&s;&s;ed; e&s;pecially when the&s;e offices have been long neglected? Mo&s;t people e&s;teem cleanline&s;s; and even tho&s;e who do not practi&s;e it them&s;elves, often admire it in others. Superior cleanline&s;s &s;ooner attracts our regard than even finery it&s;elf, and often gains e&s;teem where the other fails.</P>

<HEAD>INTEMPERANCE.</HEAD>
<P>A modern author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rou&s;&s;eau.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, that temperance and ex|erci&s;e are the two be&s;t phy&s;icians in the world. He might have added, that if the&s;e were duly regarded, there would be little occa&s;ion for any other. Temperance may ju&s;tly be called the parent of health; but numbers of mankind act as if they thought di&s;ea&s;es and death too &s;low in their progre&s;s, and by intemperance and debauch &s;eem, as it were, to &s;ollicit their approach.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="012338_0060_0F88ED98899AFC00">
THE danger of intemperance appears from the very con|&s;truction of the human body. Health depends on that &s;tate of the &s;olids and fluids which fits them for the due perform|ance of the vital functions; and &s;o long as the&s;e go regular|ly on, we are &s;ound and well; but whatever di&s;turbs them, nece&s;&s;arily impairs health. Intemperance never fails to di&s;|order the whole animal oeconomy; it &s;poils the dige&s;tion, relaxes the nerves, renders the different &s;ecretions irregular, vitiates the humours, and of cour&s;e occa&s;ions di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>THE analogy between the nouri&s;hment of plants and animals affords a &s;trong proof of the danger of intemper|ance. Moi&s;ture and manure greatly promote vegetation; but an over-quantity of either will entirely prevent it. The be&s;t things become hurtful, nay de&s;tructive, when carried to exce&s;s. From hence we learn, that the greate&s;t pitch of human wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ts in regulating our appetites and pa&s;|&s;ions &s;o as to avoid all extremes. 'Tis that alone which en|titles us to the character of rational beings. The &s;lave of appetite will ever be the di&s;grace of human nature.</P>
<P>THE Author of nature hath endued us with various pa&s;|&s;ions, for the propagation of the &s;pecies, the pre&s;ervation of the individual, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Intemperance is the abu&s;e of the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions; and in the proper regulation of them moderation con|&s;i&s;ts. Men, not content with &s;atisfying the &s;imple calls of nature, create artificial wants, and are perpetually in &s;earch after &s;omething that may gratify them; but imaginary wants can never be gratified. Nature is content with a little; but luxury knows no bounds. The epicure, the drunkard and the debauchee &s;eldom &s;top in their career till ca&s;h or con|&s;titution fails: Then indeed they generally &s;ee their error, when too late.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to lay down determined rules of tem|perance, on account of the different con&s;titutions of man|kind. The mo&s;t ignorant per&s;on however certaily knows what is meant by exce&s;s; and it is in the power of every man to avoid it, if he chu&s;es. The great rule in regulat|ing our diet, is to &s;tudy &s;implicity. Nature delights in the mo&s;t plain and &s;imple food, and every animal, except man, follows her dictates. Man alone riots at large, and ran&s;acks the whole creation in que&s;t of luxuries, to his own de&s;truction. An elegant writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Addi&s;on.</NOTE> of the la&s;t age &s;peaks thus of intemperance: <Q>For my part, when I behold a fa&s;hionable table &s;et out in all its magnificence, I fancy
<PB N="57" REF="012338_0061_0F88ED9931008288">
that I &s;ee gouts and drop&s;ies, fevers and lethargies, with other innumerable di&s;tempers, lying in ambu&s;cade among the di&s;hes.</Q></P>
<P>INTEMPERANCE does not hurt it's votaries alone; the innocent too often feel the direful effects of it. How many wretched orphans are to be &s;een embracing dunghills, who&s;e parents, regardle&s;s of the future, &s;pent in riot and debauch what might have &s;erved decently to feed and cloath their offspring? How often do we behold the mi&s;erable mo|ther, with her helple&s;s infants, pining in want, while the cruel father is indulging even at the expence of their lives!</P>
<P>FAMILIES are not only reduced to mi&s;ery, but extirpated by means of intemperance. Nothing tends &s;o much to pre|vent propagation, and to &s;horten the lives of children. The poor man who labours all day, and at night lies down contented with his humble fare, can boa&s;t a numerous off|&s;pring, while his pampered lord, &s;unk in ea&s;e and luxury, has neither &s;on nor nephew. Even &s;tates and empires feel the influence of intemperance, and ri&s;e or fall as it prevails.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of mentioning the different kinds of intem|perance, and pointing out their influence upon health, we &s;hall confine our ob&s;ervations to one particular &s;pecies of that vice, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the abu&s;e of intoxicating liquors.</P>
<P>EVERY act of intoxication puts nature to the expence of a fever, in order to di&s;charge the &s;uperfluous load; but when that is repeated almo&s;t every day, it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee the con&s;equences. That con&s;titution mu&s;t be &s;trong indeed which is able long to hold out under a daily fever! But fevers occa&s;ioned by drinking do not always go off in a day; they frequently end in an inflammation of the brea&s;t, liver or brain, and produce fatal effects.</P>
<P>THOUGH the drunkard &s;hould not fall by an acute di&s;|ea&s;e, he &s;eldom e&s;capes tho&s;e of a chronic nature. Intoxi|cating liquors, when u&s;ed to exce&s;s, weaken the bowels and &s;poil the dige&s;tion; they de&s;troy the power of the nerves, and occa&s;ion paralytic and convul&s;ive di&s;orders; they heat and inflame the blood, de&s;troy it's bal&s;amic qua|lity, render it unfit for circulation, and the nouri&s;hment of the parts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence ob&s;tructions, atrophies, drop&s;ies, and con&s;umptions of the lungs. The&s;e are the common ways in which drunkards make their exit. Di&s;ea&s;es of this kind, when brought on by hard drinking, &s;eldom ad|mit of a cure.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="012338_0062_0F88ED99E9A6BC28">
MANY people injure their health by drinking, who &s;el|dom get drunk. The continual habit of &s;oaking, as it is called, though its effects be not &s;o violent, is no le&s;s per|nicious. When the ve&s;&s;els are kept con&s;tantly full and upon the &s;tretch, the different dige&s;tions can neither be duly performed, nor the humours properly prepared. Hence mo&s;t people of this character are afflicted with the gout, the gravel, ulcerous &s;ores in the legs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If the&s;e di&s;|orders do not appear, they are &s;eized with low &s;pirits, hypochondriacal di&s;orders, and other &s;ymptoms of indi|ge&s;tion.</P>
<P>ALL intoxicating liquors may be con&s;idered as poi&s;ons. However di&s;gui&s;ed, that is their real character, and &s;ooner or later they will have their effect. Con&s;umptions are now &s;o common, that it is thought one tenth of the inhabitants of great towns die of that di&s;ea&s;e. Drunkenne&s;s is one of the cau&s;es to which we mu&s;t impute the increa&s;e of con|&s;umptions. The great quantities of vi&s;cid malt-liquor drank by the common people of England, cannot fail to render the blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">izy and unfit for circulation; from whence pro|ceed ob&s;tructions and inflammations of the lungs. There are few great ale-drinkers who are not phthi&s;ical; nor is that to be wondered at, con&s;idering the glutinous and almo&s;t indige&s;tible nature of &s;trong ale. Tho&s;e who drink ardent &s;pirits or &s;trong wines, do not run le&s;s hazard; the&s;e liquors heat and inflame the blood, and tear the tender ve&s;&s;els of the lungs in pieces.</P>
<P>THE habit of drinking proceeds frequently from mi&s;|fortunes in life. The mi&s;erable fly to it for relief. It af|fords them indeed a temporary ea&s;e. But alas, this &s;olace is &s;hort-lived, and when it is over, the &s;pirits &s;ink as much below their natural pitch, as they had before been rai&s;ed above it. Hence a repetition of the do&s;e becomes nece&s;&s;ary, and every fre&s;h do&s;e makes way for another, till the un|happy wretch becomes a &s;lave to the bottle, and at length falls a &s;acrifice to what nature intended only as a medicine. No man is &s;o dejected as the drunkard when his debauch is gone off. Hence it is, that tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t flow of &s;pirits while the gla&s;s circulates freely, are of all others the mo&s;t melancholy when &s;ober, and often put an end to their own mi&s;erable exi&s;tence in a fit of &s;pleen or ill humour.</P>
<P>DRUNKENNESS not only proves de&s;tructive to health, but likewi&s;e to the faculties of the mind. It is &s;trange,
<PB N="59" REF="012338_0063_0F88ED9AAB1A7838">
that creatures who value them&s;elves on account of a &s;u|perior degree of rea&s;on to that of brutes, &s;hould take plea|&s;ure in &s;inking &s;o far below them. Were &s;uch as volun|tarily deprive them&s;elves of the u&s;e of rea&s;on, to continue ever after in that condition, it would &s;eem but a ju&s;t pu|ni&s;hment. Though that be not the con&s;equence of one act of drunkenne&s;s, it &s;eldom fails to &s;ucceed a cour&s;e of intoxication. By a habit of drinking, the greate&s;t genius is often reduced to a mere dunce.</P>

<HEAD>INACTIVITY.</HEAD>
<P>MANY look upon the nece&s;&s;ity man is under of earning his bread by labour as a cur&s;e. Be that as it may, it is evident from the &s;tructure of the body, that exerci&s;e is not le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of health, than food. Tho&s;e whom poverty obliges to labour for daily bread, are not only the mo&s;t healthy, but generally the mo&s;t happy. Indu&s;try &s;eldom fails to place &s;uch above want, and activity &s;erves them in&s;tead of phy&s;ic. This is peculiarly the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who live by the culture of the ground. The great increa&s;e of inhabitants in infant-colonies, and the common longevity of &s;uch as follow agriculture every where, evidently prove it the mo&s;t healthful as well as the mo&s;t u&s;eful employment.</P>
<P>THE love of activity &s;hows it&s;elf very early in man. So &s;trong is this principle, that a healthy youth cannot be re&s;trained from exerci&s;e, even by the fear of puni&s;h|ment. Our love of motion is &s;urely a &s;trong proof of its utility. Nature implants no di&s;po&s;ition in vain. Some imagine, that the love of motion was implanted in man, becau&s;e without it he could not obtain the nece&s;&s;aries of life; but &s;uppo&s;e the nece&s;&s;aries of life could be univer&s;ally obtained without motion, it would neverthele&s;s be indi&s;|pen&s;able. It &s;eems to be a catholic law throughout the whole animal creation, that no creature, without exerci&s;e, can enjoy health. Every creature, except man, takes as much exerci&s;e as is nece&s;&s;ary. He alone, and &s;uch animals as are under his direction, deviate from this original law, and they &s;uffer accordingly.</P>
<P>INACTIVITY never fails to bring on univer&s;al relaxation of the &s;olids, which occa&s;ions innumerable di&s;ea&s;es. When the &s;olids are relaxed, neither the dige&s;tion, nor any of the &s;ecretions, can be duly performed. In this ca&s;e the
<PB N="60" REF="012338_0064_0F88ED9BE1622C50">
wor&s;t con&s;equences mu&s;t en&s;ue. How can tho&s;e who loll all day in ea&s;y chairs, and &s;leep all night on a bed of down, fail to be relaxed? Nor do &s;uch greatly mend the matter, who never &s;tir abroad but in a coach, or &s;edan, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e elegant pieces of luxury are become &s;o common, that the inhabitants of great towns &s;eem to be in &s;ome danger of lo&s;ing the u&s;e of their limbs altogether. 'Tis now below any one to walk who can afford to be carried. How ridi|culous would it &s;eem to a per&s;on unacquainted with modern luxury, to behold the young and healthy &s;winging along on the &s;houlders of their fellow-creatures! or to &s;ee a fat carca&s;e, over-run with di&s;ea&s;es occa&s;ioned by inactivity, dragged through the &s;treets by half a dozen hor&s;es.</P>
<P>GLANDULAR ob&s;tructions generally proceed from in|activity. The&s;e are the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate of all maladies. So long as the liver, kidnies, and other glands, duly perform their functions, health is &s;eldom impaired; but when they fail, nothing can pre&s;erve it. Exerci&s;e is almo&s;t the only cure we know for glandular ob&s;tructions; indeed it does not always &s;ucceed, but there is rea&s;on to believe, that it would &s;eldom fail to prevent the&s;e complaints. One thing is certain, that among&s;t tho&s;e who take enough of exerci&s;e, glandular di&s;ea&s;es are very little known; whereas the indolent and inactive are &s;eldom free from them.</P>
<P>WEAK nerves are the con&s;tant companions of inactivity. Nothing but exerci&s;e and open air can brace and &s;trengthen the nerves, or prevent the endle&s;s train of di&s;ea&s;es which proceed from a relaxed &s;tate of the&s;e organs. We &s;eldom hear the active or laborious complain of nervous di&s;ea&s;es; the&s;e are re&s;erved for the &s;ons of ea&s;e and affluence. Many have been compleatly cured of nervous di&s;orders by being reduced from a &s;tate of opulence to labour for their daily bread. This plainly points out the &s;ources from whence &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es flow, and the means by which they may be prevented.</P>
<P>IT is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to enjoy health without a free per&s;piration; but that nece&s;&s;ary di&s;charge never goes pro|perly on where exerci&s;e is wanting. When the matter which ought to be thrown off by per&s;piration, is retained in the body, it cannot fail to vitiate the humours. Hence proceed the gout, fevers, rheumati&s;m, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In a word, none of the vital or animal functions can be duly per|formed when exerci&s;e is neglected. It alone would pre|vent
<PB N="61" REF="012338_0065_0F88EDA00DDCD7E8">
many di&s;ea&s;es which cannot be cured, and would re|move others where medicine proves ineffectual.</P>
<P>A late author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE>, in his excellent treati&s;e on health, &s;ays, that the weak and valetudinary ought to make exerci&s;e a part of their religion. We would recommend this, not on|ly to the weak and valetudinary, but to all who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s does not oblige them to take &s;ufficient exerci&s;e, as &s;edentary artificers, &s;hop-keepers, &s;tudious people, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such ought to take exerci&s;e as regularly as they take food. This, were people careful to hu&s;band their time well, might be done without any interruption to bu&s;ine&s;s or &s;tudy.</P>
<P>No piece of indolence hurts the health more than the modern cu&s;tom of lolling a-bed too long in a morning. This is univer&s;ally the ca&s;e in great towns. The inhabitants of cities &s;eldom do much bu&s;ine&s;s before breakfa&s;t; but that is the be&s;t time for exerci&s;e, while the &s;tomach is empty, and the body refre&s;hed with &s;leep. Ri&s;ing early would not on|ly give tho&s;e who cannot leave their bu&s;ine&s;s through the day, an opportunity of taking exerci&s;e, but it would prevent the bad effects of loitering in bed too long. The morning air braces and &s;trengthens the nerves, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of a cold bath. Let any one who has been accu&s;tomed to lie a-bed till eight or nine o'clock, ri&s;e by &s;ix or &s;even, &s;pend a couple of hours in walking, riding, or any active diver&s;ion without doors, and he will find his &s;pirits chearful and &s;erene through the day, his appetite keen, and his body braced and &s;trengthened. Cu&s;tom &s;oon ren|ders early ri&s;ing agreeable, and nothing contributes more to the pre&s;ervation of health.</P>
<P>EXERCISE, if po&s;&s;ible, ought always to be taken in the open air. When that cannot be done, various methods may be contrived for exerci&s;ing the body within doors, as dan|cing, fencing, the dumb bell, playing at tennis, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is not nece&s;&s;ary to adhere &s;trictly to any particular kind of exerci&s;e. The be&s;t way is to take them by turns, and to u&s;e that longe&s;t which is mo&s;t &s;uitable to the &s;trength and con|&s;titution. The&s;e kinds of exerci&s;e which give action to mo&s;t of the bodily organs, are always to be preferred, as riding, walking, running, digging, &s;wimming, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>IT is much to be regretted, that active and manly diver|&s;ions are now &s;o little regarded. Diver&s;ions make people take more exerci&s;e than they otherwi&s;e would do, and are of the greate&s;t &s;ervice to &s;uch as are not under the nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="62" REF="012338_0066_0F88EDA1AAD0D4A8">
of labouring for their bread. As active diver&s;ions lo&s;e ground, tho&s;e of a &s;edentary kind &s;eem to prevail. Sedentary diver&s;ions are of no other u&s;e than to con&s;ume the time which might be employed in exerci&s;e: In&s;tead of relieving the mind, they often require more thought than either &s;tu|dy or bu&s;ine&s;s. Every thing that induces people to &s;it &s;till, unle&s;s it be &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary employment, ought to be avoided.</P>
<P>THE diver&s;ions which afford the be&s;t exerci&s;e are, hunt|ing, &s;hooting, playing at cricket, hand-ball, golff<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Golff is a diver&s;ion very common in North-Britain. It is well calculated for exerci&s;ing the body, and may always be taken in &s;uch moderation, as neither to over-heat nor fatigue.

They likewi&s;e &s;trengthen the lungs, and give firmne&s;s and agility to the whole body.</P>
<P>SUCH as can, ought to &s;pend two or three hours a-day on hor&s;eback; tho&s;e who cannot, &s;hould employ the &s;ame time in walking. The be&s;t time for taking exerci&s;e is in the morning, or at lea&s;t before dinner; but it &s;hould never be continued too long. Over fatigue prevents the benefit of exerci&s;e, and weakens in&s;tead of &s;trengthening the body.</P>
<P>EVERY man &s;hould lay him&s;elf under &s;ome &s;ort of nece&s;&s;i|ty to take exerci&s;e. Indolence, like all other vices, when in|dulged, gains ground, and at length becomes agreeable. Hence, many who were fond of exerci&s;e in the early part of life, become quite aver&s;e to it afterwards. This is the ca&s;e of mo&s;t hypochondriac and gouty people, which ren|ders their di&s;ea&s;es in a great mea&s;ure incurable.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome countries laws have been made, obliging every man, of whatever rank, to learn &s;ome mechanical employ|ment. Whether &s;uch laws were de&s;igned for the pre&s;erva|tion of health, or encouragement of manufacture, is a que|&s;tion of no importance. Certain it is, that if gentlemen were frequently to amu&s;e and exerci&s;e them&s;elves in this way, it might have many good effects. They would, at lea&s;t, derive as much honour from a few ma&s;terly &s;pecimens of their own workman&s;hip, as from the character of having ruined mo&s;t of their companions by gaming or hard drink|ing. Be&s;ides, men of lei&s;ure, by applying them&s;elves to the mechanical arts, might improve them, to the great benefit of &s;ociety. This would afford a more comfortable reflec|tion at the clo&s;e of life, than the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having lived in the world for no other purpo&s;e than to eat and drink.</P>

INDOLENCE not only occa&s;ions di&s;ea&s;es, and renders men u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ociety, but promotes all manner of vice. To &s;ay a man is idle, is perhaps, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, to call him vicious. The mind, if not engaged in &s;ome u&s;eful pur&s;uit, is con&s;tantly in que&s;t of ideal plea&s;ures, or impre&s;&s;ed with the apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome imaginary evil.

<HEAD>INFECTION.</HEAD>
<P>MOST di&s;ea&s;es are infectious. Every per&s;on ought, there|fore, as far as he can, to avoid all communication with the di&s;ea&s;ed. The common practice of vi&s;iting the &s;ick, though well meant, has many ill con&s;equences. Far be it from us to di&s;courage any act charity or benevolence, e&s;pecially towards tho&s;e in di&s;tre&s;s; but we cannot help blaming &s;uch as endanger their own or neighbours lives by a mi&s;taken friend&s;hip, or an impertinent curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;es of the &s;ick, e&s;pecially in the country, are gene|rally crowded from morning till night with idle vi&s;itors. It is cu&s;tomary, in &s;uch places, for &s;ervants and young people to wait upon the &s;ick by turns. It would be a miracle indeed &s;hould &s;uch always e&s;cape. Experience teaches us the dan|ger of this conduct. People often catch fevers in this way, and communicate them to others, till at length they be|come epidemic.</P>
<P>IT would be thought highly improper for one who had not had the &s;mall-pox, to wait upon a patient in that di&s;ea&s;e; yet many other fevers are almo&s;t as infectious as the &s;mall|pox, and not le&s;s fatal. Some imagine, that fevers prove more fatal in villages than in great towns, for want of pro|per medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance. How far that is true, we will not pretend to &s;ay; but we are inclined to think, that it rather proceeds from the cau&s;e above mentioned.</P>
<P>WERE a plan to be laid down for communicating infec|tion, it could not be done more effectually than by the common method of vi&s;iting the &s;ick. Such vi&s;itors not only endanger them&s;elves and their connections, but likewi&s;e hurt the &s;ick. By crowding the hou&s;e, they render the air un|whole&s;ome, and by their private whi&s;pers and di&s;mal coun|tenances, di&s;turb the imagination of the &s;ick and depre&s;s
<PB N="64" REF="012338_0068_0F88EDA3D6A879E0">
his &s;pirits. Sick per&s;ons, e&s;pecially in fevers, ought to be kept as quiet as po&s;&s;ible. The &s;ight of &s;trange faces, and every thing that di&s;turbs the mind, hurts them.</P>
<P>THE common practice in country places of inviting great numbers of people to funerals, and crowding them into the &s;ame apartment where the corp&s;e lies, is another way of &s;preading infection. The infection by no means dies with the patient. In many ca&s;es it rather grows &s;tronger as the body becomes putrid. This is peculiarly the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who die of malignant fevers, or other putrid di&s;ea&s;es. Such ought not to lie long unburied; and people &s;hould keep at a di&s;tance from them. It is very common for people, after attending the funeral of a friend, to be &s;eized with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e of which he died, and to &s;hare the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P>IT would tend greatly to prevent the &s;preading of infec|tious di&s;ea&s;es, if tho&s;e in health were kept at a proper di&s;|tance from the &s;ick. The Jewi&s;h Legi&s;lator, among many other wi&s;e in&s;titutions for pre&s;erving health, has been pecu|liarly attentive to the means of preventing infection, or <HI>de|filement,</HI> as it is called, either from a di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on or a dead body. In many ca&s;es the di&s;ea&s;ed were to be &s;eparated from tho&s;e in health; and it was deemed a crime even to ap|proach their habitations. If a per&s;on only touched a dead body, he was appointed to wa&s;h him&s;elf in water, and to keep for &s;ome time at a di&s;tance from &s;ociety.</P>
<P>INFECTIOUS di&s;ea&s;es are often communicated by cloaths. It is extremely dangerous to wear apparel which has been worn by the di&s;ea&s;ed, as infection will lodge in it a long while, and afterwards produce very tragical effects. This &s;hows the danger of buying at random the cloaths which have been u&s;ed by other people.</P>
<P>INFECTIOUS di&s;orders are frequently imported. Com|merce, together with the riches of foreign climes, brings us al&s;o their di&s;ea&s;es. The&s;e do often more than counterbalance all the advantages of that trade, by means of which they are introduced. It is to be regretted that &s;o little care is com|monly taken, either to prevent the introduction or &s;preading of infectious di&s;ea&s;es. Some attention, indeed, is generally paid to the plague; but other di&s;ea&s;es pa&s;s unregarded.</P>
<P>INFECTION is often &s;pread by jails, ho&s;pitals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e are frequently &s;ituated in the very middle of cities, or po|pulous towns; and when infectious di&s;ea&s;es break out in them, it is impo&s;&s;ible for the inhabitants to e&s;cape. Were magi&s;trates to pay any regard to the health of the people, this evil might be ea&s;ily remedied.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="012338_0069_0F88EDA46B0054D0">
MANY are the cau&s;es which tend to diffu&s;e infection through populous cities. The whole atmo&s;phere of a large town is one contaminated ma&s;s, abounding with every kind of infection, and mu&s;t be pernicious to health. The be&s;t advice that we can give to &s;uch as live in cities, is to choo&s;e an open &s;ituation; to avoid narrow, dirty, crowded &s;treets; to keep their own hou&s;es and offices clean; to admit the fre&s;h air every day into their apartments; and to be as much abroad as their time will permit.</P>
<P>IT would tend greatly to prevent the &s;preading of infec|tious di&s;ea&s;es, were proper nur&s;es every where employed to take care of the &s;ick. This might often &s;ave a family, or even a whole town, from being infected by one per&s;on. We do not mean that people &s;hould abandon their friends or relations in di&s;tre&s;s, but only to put them on their guard again&s;t being too much in company with tho&s;e who are af|flicted with di&s;ea&s;es of an infectious nature.</P>
<P>SUCH as wait upon the &s;ick in infectious di&s;ea&s;es, ought to &s;tuff their no&s;es with tobacco, or &s;ome other &s;trong &s;mel|ling herb, as rue, tan&s;y, or the like. They ought likewi&s;e frequently to &s;prinkle the room where the patient lies with vinegar, or other &s;trong acids; and to avoid the patient's breath as much as they can.</P>
<P>HOWEVER ea&s;y the&s;e hints may &s;eem; yet a proper atten|tion to them would &s;ave many lives. A fever, or other in|fectious di&s;ea&s;e, &s;eldom breaks out in a family, but it affects the mo&s;t of them, and frequently &s;eizes every individual. The &s;cenes of calamity and di&s;tre&s;s produced by this means, are too often witne&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e who attend the &s;ick.</P>
<P>YOUNG people are peculiarly liable to catch infection; and therefore ought to be kept at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the di&s;ea&s;ed. Their minds are ea&s;ily affected with &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s, and they often catch di&s;ea&s;es even by the force of imagination.</P>
<P>WE would not only recommend it to magi&s;trates, to take proper mea&s;ures to prevent the &s;preading of infectious di&s;|ea&s;es, but al&s;o to ma&s;ters of families. A &s;ingle &s;ervant may &s;pread a di&s;ea&s;e among&s;t a whole family, which may prove fatal to many of them. For this rea&s;on, when a &s;ervant is &s;eized with a fever, or other infectious di&s;ea&s;e, he ought to be kept in &s;ome &s;eparate apartment, or rather &s;ent to an ho&s;|pital or infirmary. Servants would not only be taken better care of in this way, but fatal di&s;ea&s;es might be often pre|vented.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="012338_0070_0F88EDA52CD03AA0">
INFECTION is often caught by &s;leeping with the di&s;ea&s;ed. Every per&s;on knows that this is the ca&s;e in con&s;umptions of the lungs; but other di&s;ea&s;es are infectious as well as con&s;umptions: Nay, we hardly know any di&s;ea&s;e that is not &s;o in &s;ome degree. If a &s;ound per&s;on communicates health, &s;urely a di&s;ea&s;ed one mu&s;t have the contrary effect. Were this attended to in the choice of companions for life, it would &s;ave many from a premature end.</P>
<P>NOT only the di&s;ea&s;es of the body, but al&s;o tho&s;e of the mind are infectious. For this rea&s;on, our companions ought to be of a &s;ound mind, as well as a &s;ound body. A melancholy per&s;on, for example, diffu&s;es a gloom all around him, and generally taints the minds of his companions with the temper of his own. Tho&s;e who would be healthy and happy, ought therefore to a&s;&s;ociate with the young, the chearful, and good humoured.</P>

<HEAD>THE PASSIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ions have great influence both in the cau&s;e and cure of di&s;ea&s;es. How mind acts upon matter, will, in all probability, ever remain a &s;ecret. It is &s;ufficient for us to know, that there is e&s;tabli&s;hed a reciprocal influence be|twixt the mental and corporeal parts, and the whatever di&s;|orders the one likewi&s;e hurts the other.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>anger</HI> ruffles the mind, di&s;torts the coun|tenance, hurries on the circulation of the blood, and di&s;or|ders the whole vital and animal functions. It often occa|&s;ions fevers, with other acute di&s;ea&s;es; and &s;ometimes brings on &s;udden death. This pa&s;&s;ion is peculiarly hurtful to the delicate, and tho&s;e of weak nerves. I have known a hy&s;teric woman lo&s;e her life by a violent fit of anger; all &s;uch ought to guard again&s;t the exce&s;s of this pa&s;&s;ion with the utmo&s;t ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e.</P>
<P>IT is not always in our power of prevent being angry; but we may &s;urely avoid harbouring re&s;entment in our brea&s;t. Re&s;entment preys upon the mind; it occa&s;ions the mo&s;t ob|&s;tinate chronical di&s;orders, and gradually wa&s;tes the con|&s;titution. Nothing &s;hows true greatne&s;s of mind more, than to forgive injuries: It promotes the peace of &s;ociety, and greatly conduces to our own ea&s;e, health, and felicity.</P>
<P>SUCH as value health &s;hould avoid violent gu&s;ts of anger, as they would the mo&s;t deadly infection. They ought never to indulge re&s;entment, but to endeavour at all times to keep
<PB N="67" REF="012338_0071_0F88EDA5ED375528">
their minds calm and &s;erene. Nothing tends &s;o much to the health of the body as a con&s;tant tranquillity of mind.</P>
<P>THE influence of fear, both in occa&s;ioning and aggra|vating di&s;ea&s;es, is very great. No man ought to be blamed for a decent concern about life; but too great a de&s;ire to pre&s;erve it, is often the way to lo&s;e it. Fear and anxiety, by depre&s;&s;ing the &s;pirits, pre-di&s;po&s;e us to di&s;ea&s;es, and often render tho&s;e fatal, which an undaunted mind would overcome.</P>
<P>SUDDEN fear has generally violent effects. Epilectic fits, and other convul&s;ive di&s;orders, are often occa&s;ioned by it. Hence the danger of that practice, &s;o common among young people, of frightening one another. By this many have lo&s;t their lives, and others have been rendered u&s;ele&s;s ever after. It is dangerous to tamper with the human pa&s;|&s;ions. They may ea&s;ily be thrown into &s;uch di&s;order as never again to act with regularity.</P>
<P>BUT the gradual effects of fear prove more generally hurtful. The con&s;tant dread of &s;ome future evil, by dwell|ing upon the mind, often occa&s;ions the very evil it&s;elf. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that &s;o many die of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, of which they long had a dread, or which &s;ome accident, or fooli&s;h prediction, had impre&s;&s;ed on their minds. This often happens to women in childbed. Many of tho&s;e who die in that &s;ituation, are impre&s;&s;ed with the notion of their death a long while before it happens; and there is rea&s;on to believe, that &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions are often the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>THE methods taken to impre&s;s the minds of women with apprehen&s;ions of the great danger and peril of child|birth, are very hurtful. Few women die in labour, though many lo&s;e their lives after it; which may be thus accounted for. A woman after delivery finding her&s;elf weak and ex|hau&s;ted, immediately apprehends &s;he is in danger; but fear &s;eldom fails to ob&s;truct the nece&s;&s;ary evacuations, upon which her recovery depends. Thus the &s;ex often fall a &s;acrifice to their own imaginations, when there would be no danger, did they apprehend none.</P>
<P>IT &s;eldom happens, that two or three women, who are generally known, die in child-bed, but their death is fol|lowed by many others. Every woman of their acquaint|ance who is with child, dreads the &s;ame fate, and the di&s;|ea&s;e becomes epidemical by the mere force of imagination. This &s;hould induce pregnant women to di&s;pi&s;e fear, and
<PB N="68" REF="012338_0072_0F88EDA6AA849CF0">
by all means to avoid tho&s;e tattling go&s;&s;ips, who are con|tinually telling them the misfortunes of others. Every thing that may in the lea&s;t alarm a pregnant or child-bed woman, ought with the greate&s;t care to be guarded again&s;t. Many women have lo&s;t their lives in child-bed by the old &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;tom, &s;till kept up in mo&s;t parts of Britain, of tolling the pari&s;h-bell for every per&s;on who dies. People who think them&s;elves in danger, are very inqui&s;itive; and if they come to know, that the bell tolls for one who died in the &s;ame &s;ituation, what mu&s;t be the con&s;equence?</P>
<P>BUT this cu&s;tom is not pernicious to child-bed women only. It is hurtful in many other ca&s;es. When low fe|vers in which it is difficult to &s;upport the patient's &s;pirits, prevail, what mu&s;t be the effect of a funeral peal &s;ound|ing five or &s;ix times a day in his ears? His imagination will no doubt &s;ugge&s;t, that others died of the &s;ame di&s;|ea&s;e, which he labours under. Nor will the matter be at all mended by endeavouring to per&s;uade him of the contrary. This will tend rather to confirm than remove his &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>IF this childi&s;h cu&s;tom cannot be aboli&s;hed, we ought to keep the &s;ick as much from hearing it as po&s;&s;ible, and from every thing el&s;e that may tend to alarm them. So far is this from being attended to, that many make it their bu&s;i|ne&s;s to vi&s;it the &s;ick, on purpo&s;e to whi&s;per di&s;mal &s;tories in their ears. Such may pa&s;s for &s;ympathizing friends, but they ought rather to be reckoned enemies, and ranked among&s;t murderers. All who wi&s;h well to the &s;ick, ought to keep &s;uch per&s;ons at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from them.</P>
<P>A cu&s;tom has long prevailed among phy&s;icians of prog|no&s;ticating, as they call it, the patient's fate, or foretelling the i&s;&s;ue of the di&s;ea&s;e. Vanity no doubt introduced this practice, and &s;till &s;upports it, in &s;pite of common &s;en&s;e and the &s;afety of mankind. I have known a phy&s;ician barbarous enough to boa&s;t, that he pronounced more <HI>&s;en|tences</HI> than all his Maje&s;ty's judges. Would to God that &s;uch &s;entences were not often equally fatal! It may be alledged, that the doctor does not declare his opinion be|fore the patient. So, much the wor&s;e. A &s;en&s;ible patient had better hear what the doctor &s;ays, than learn it from the di&s;con&s;olate looks, the watery eyes, and the broken whi&s;pers of tho&s;e about him. It &s;eldom happens, when the doctor gives an unfavourable opinion, that it can be
<PB N="69" REF="012338_0073_0F88EDA76BDA8060">
concealed from the patient. The very embera&s;&s;ment which generally appears in di&s;gui&s;ing what he has &s;aid, is &s;ufficient to di&s;cover the truth.</P>
<P>WE do not &s;ee what right any man has to announce the death of another, e&s;pecially if &s;uch a declaration has a chance to kill him. Mankind are indeed very fond of prying into future events, and &s;eldom fail to importune the phy&s;ician for his opinion. A doubtful an&s;wer, however, or one that may tend to encourage the hopes of the patient, is &s;urely the mo&s;t &s;afe. This conduct could neither hurt the patient nor the phy&s;ician. Nothing tends more to de|&s;troy the credit of phy&s;ic than tho&s;e bold progno&s;ticators, who, by the by, are generally the mo&s;t ignorant. The mi&s;takes which daily happen in this way, are &s;o many &s;tanding proofs of human vanity, and the weakne&s;s of &s;cience.</P>
<P>THE vanity of foretelling the fate of the &s;ick is not peculiar to the Faculty. Others follow their example, and tho&s;e who think them&s;elves wi&s;er than their neighbours, often do much mi&s;chief, in this way. Humanity &s;urely calls upon every one to comfort the &s;ick, and not to add to their affliction, by alarming their fears. A phy&s;ician may often do more good by a mild and &s;impathizing be|haviour than by medicine, and &s;hould never neglect to ad|mini&s;ter that greate&s;t of all cordials, HOPE.</P>
<P>GRIEF is the mo&s;t de&s;tructive of all the pa&s;&s;ions. Its effects are permanent, and when it &s;inks deep into the mind, it generally proves fatal. Anger and fear being of a more violent nature, &s;eldom la&s;t long; but grief often changes into a fixed melancholy, which preys upon the &s;pirits, and wa&s;tes the con&s;titution. We &s;hould beware of the indulging this pa&s;&s;ion. It may generally be conquered at the beginning; but when it has gained &s;trength, all our attempts become vain.</P>
<P>NO per&s;on can prevent misfortunes; but it &s;hows true greatne&s;s of mind to bear them with &s;erenity. Many make a merit of indulging grief, and when misfortunes happen, they ob&s;tinately refu&s;e all con&s;olation, till the mind, over|whelmed with melancholy, &s;inks under the load. Such conduct is not only de&s;tructive to health, but incon&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on, religion and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>CHANGE of ideas is as nece&s;&s;ary for health as change of po&s;ture. When the mind dwells long upon one object, e&s;pecially of a di&s;agreeable nature, it hurts the whole func|tions
<PB N="70" REF="012338_0074_0F88EDA853753B50">
of the body. Thus grief indulged &s;poils the dige&s;tion, and de&s;troys the appetite. By that means the &s;pirits are de|pre&s;&s;ed, the nerves relaxed, the bowels inflated with wind, and the humours, for want of fre&s;h &s;upplies of chyle, vi|tiated. Thus many an excellent con&s;titution has been ruined by a family-misfortune, or any thing that occa|&s;ioned exce&s;&s;ive grief.</P>
<P>IT is utterly impo&s;&s;ible, that any per&s;on of a dejected mind &s;hould enjoy health. Life may indeed be dragged on for a few years: But whoever would live to a good old age, mu&s;t be good humoured and chearful. This indeed is not altogether in our own power; yet our temper of mind, as well as actions, depends greatly upon our&s;elves. We can either think of agreeable or di&s;agreeable objects, as we chu&s;e; we can go into chearful or melancholy com|pany; we can mingle in the amu&s;ements and offices of life, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it &s;till and brood over our calamities. The&s;e, and many &s;uch things, are certainly in our power, and from the&s;e the mind generally takes its ca&s;t.</P>
<P>THE variety of &s;cenes which pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the &s;en&s;es, were certainly de&s;igned to prevent our attention from being too long fixed upon any one object. Nature abounds with variety, and the mind, unle&s;s fixed down by habit, delights in contemplating new objects. This at once points out the method of relieving the mind in di&s;|tre&s;s. Turn the attention to other objects. Examine them with accuracy. When the mind begins to recoil, &s;hift the &s;cene. By this means a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new ideas may be kept up, till the di&s;agreeable ones entire|ly di&s;appear. Thus travelling, the &s;tudy of any art or &s;cience, reading or writing on &s;uch &s;ubjects as engage the attention, will &s;ooner expel grief than the mo&s;t &s;prightly amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>IT has already been ob&s;erved, that exerci&s;e is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the health of the body; but it is no le&s;s &s;o for that of the mind. Indolence nouri&s;hes grief. When the mind has nothing el&s;e to think of but calamities, no wonder that it dwells there. Few people who pur&s;ue bu&s;i|ne&s;s with attention, are hurt by grief. In&s;tead of ab&s;tract|ing our&s;elves from the world or bu&s;ine&s;s, when misfortunes happen, we ought to engage in it with more than u&s;ual at|tention, to di&s;charge with double diligence the functions of our &s;tation, and to mix with friends of an ea&s;y &s;ocial temper.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="012338_0075_0F88EDABEA5F03F0">
INNOCENT amu&s;ements are by no means to be neglected. The&s;e, by leading the mind in&s;en&s;ibly to the contemplation of agreeable objects, help to di&s;pel the gloom which mi&s;|fortunes ca&s;t over it. They make time &s;eem le&s;s tedious, and have many other happy effects.</P>
<P>SOME, when overwhelmed with grief, betake them&s;elves to drinking. This is making the cure wor&s;e than the di&s;|ea&s;e. It &s;eldom fails to end in the ruin of fortune, cha|racter and con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t way to counteract the violence of any pa&s;&s;ion is to encourage its oppo&s;ite. Thus, under the mo&s;t pre&s;|&s;ing calamities, HOPE is always to be kept in view. Hope is the very &s;upport of life, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of a rational being.</P>
<P>SHOULD all other means of comfort fail, the Chri&s;tian religion affords an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of con&s;olation. It teaches us, that the &s;ufferings of this life are de&s;igned to prepare us for a future &s;tate of happine&s;s, and that all who pur&s;ue the paths of virtue, &s;hall at la&s;t arrive at complete felicity.</P>

<HEAD>OF ARTIFICERS, LABOURERS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THAT men are expo&s;ed to particular di&s;ea&s;es from the occupations which they follow, is a fact well known; but to remedy that evil, is a difficult matter. People are under a nece&s;&s;ity of pur&s;uing the employments in which they are bred, whether they be favourable to health or not. Hence all that we can propo&s;e, under this article, is to point out tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es to which men are more immediately expo&s;ed from their particular occupations; and to &s;hew how far &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es, by due care, may be avoided.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;es of artificers that we &s;hall mention, is the unwhole&s;ome &s;mells and noxious exhala|tions which often proceed from tho&s;e materials in which they are employed. Thus tallow-chandlers, boilers of oil, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;&s;ers of leather, and all who work upon putrid animal

&s;ub&s;tances, are afflicted with di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;tomach and lungs. Ill &s;mells not only create a nau&s;ea and hurt the di|ge&s;tion, but even taint the humours them&s;elves, and fre|quently prove the cau&s;e of fevers, con&s;umptions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THESE occupations are not only hurtful to tho&s;e as are employed in them, but likewi&s;e to tho&s;e who live in the neighbourhood of the places where they are carried on; for which rea&s;on they ought always to be at a proper di&s;|tance from any town.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t advice that we can give to &s;uch as are em|ployed in this way, is, to pay the utmo&s;t attention to clean|line&s;s. They are indeed obliged to wear dirty cloaths while at work; but the moment they leave off, they ought to wa&s;h them&s;elves, &s;trip of their dirty cloaths, put on clean ones, and remove at a proper di&s;tance from the &s;mell of their work|&s;hops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> No one who has not made the trial, can imagine how far an attention to the&s;e, and other pieces of cleanli|ne&s;s, will go in pre&s;erving the health of tho&s;e artificers who are obliged to follow &s;uch employments.</P>
<P>CHYMISTS, founders, gla&s;s-makers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be&s;ides the noxious exhalations from tho&s;e bodies in which they work, are forced to breathe an air that is in a manner burnt, or at lea&s;t too much rarified to expand the lungs, or an&s;wer the important purpo&s;es of re&s;piration. Such people are ge|nerally thin, pale, and of a weak con&s;umptive habit. They are melted down with &s;weat, in order to &s;upply which eva|cuation, large quantities of liquor become nece&s;&s;ary. Thus by hard working and fa&s;t living their con&s;titutions are worn out in a few years.</P>
<P>SUCH arti&s;ts ought to work by turns, and &s;hould never continue long near the furnace at a time. They &s;hould be careful, when they leave off work, to cool gradually, avoid|ing every thing that may &s;uddenly check the per&s;piration. The places where the&s;e occupations are carried on, &s;hould be properly con&s;tructed for di&s;charging the &s;moke and other exhalations, and admitting a free current of fre&s;h air; otherwi&s;e the people who work in them, can never enjoy health.</P>
<P>THE exhalation from metals and minerals is not only hurtful to founders, chymi&s;ts, and others who manufacture them for particular purpo&s;es, but likewi&s;e to miners, or tho&s;e who dig them out of the earth. Fallopius ob&s;erves, that &s;uch as work in mines of mercury, &s;eldom live above three or four years. They are generally affected with pal&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">,
<PB N="73" REF="012338_0077_0F88EDAD6C5E2780">
vertigos, and other di&s;ea&s;es of the nerves, which &s;oon put an end to their mi&s;erable lives. Tho&s;e al&s;o who work in lead-mines are very liable to paralytic di&s;orders, with gripes, cholics, and other complaints of the bowels.</P>
<P>MINERS &s;uffer from their &s;ituation as well as from the me|tals in which they work. The air in mines being totally excluded from the &s;un's rays, by &s;tagnation lo&s;es its &s;pring, and often becomes damp. This kind of air is to be avoided as the mo&s;t deadly poi&s;on: Be&s;ides, mines are often wet, which renders them &s;till more hurtful. This is one rea&s;on why miners are very &s;ubject to aches, cramps, and rheumatic pains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>MINERS &s;hould never continue too long under ground at a time; neither ought they at any time to go to work fa&s;t|ing, nor to &s;uffer their &s;tomachs to be empty while they continue in the mines. They ought not to live too low; and their liquor &s;hould be generous. They &s;hould by all means avoid co&s;tivene&s;s, by either taking food of an open|ing nature, or, when that does not &s;ucceed, a gentle purge. Oils are found to be a good pre&s;ervative again&s;t gripes from the affluvia of metals. Oils both open the belly, and &s;heath the coats of the inte&s;tines, which prevents their be|ing hurt by the poi&s;onous particles of the metal.</P>
<P>MINERS &s;hould by all means take care that the air have a free current through the mines, and that neither it nor the water be &s;uffered to &s;tagnate. All who work in mines or metals ought to wa&s;h when they leave off work, and to change their cloaths. Tho&s;e parts of the metal which ad|here to the &s;kin or the cloaths, being continually ab&s;orbed into the body, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily do hurt. People are too apt to look upon &s;uch circum&s;tances as unworthy their at|tention; but the&s;e &s;mall cau&s;es, by being neglected, never fail to produce the mo&s;t dreadful effects.</P>
<P>PLUMBERS, painters, gilders, and all who work in me|tals, are &s;ubject to the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es as tho&s;e who dig them. They are afflicted with colics, a&s;thmas, pal&s;ies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;hould ob&s;erve the &s;ame precautions as miners. It is impo&s;|&s;ible for people thus employed, at all times to avoid &s;ome degree of danger; but it con&s;i&s;ts with ob&s;ervation, that, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e care, they may prolong their lives to a good old age, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">th a tolerable &s;hare of health.

AS it would greatly exceed our bounds to &s;pecify the di&s;orders peculiar to every occupation, we &s;hall therefore con&s;ider mankind under the following general cla&s;&s;es, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Laborious, Sedentary</HI> and <HI>Studious.</HI></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The LABORIOUS.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH tho&s;e who follow laborious employments are in general the mo&s;t healthy. yet the nature of their occupati|ons, and the places where they are carried on, expo&s;e them to many di&s;ea&s;es. Hu&s;bandmen, for example, are expo&s;ed to all the vici&s;&s;itudes of the weather, which are often very great and &s;udden. They are likewi&s;e forced to work hard, and often to carry loads above their &s;trength, which by over&s;training the ve&s;&s;els, occa&s;ion ma|ny di&s;ea&s;es, as a&s;thmas, fevers, ruptures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>INTERMITTENT fevers, or agues, are very common a|mong&s;t tho&s;e who labour without doors. The&s;e are occa&s;i|oned by the frequent vici&s;&s;itudes of heat and cold to which they are expo&s;ed, by the bad water which they are often obliged to drink, by the low mar&s;hy &s;ituation of their hou|&s;es, and by their frequent expo&s;ure to the evening dews, night-air, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>ASTHMAS and inflammations of the brea&s;t are very inci|dent to the laborious. The&s;e are occa&s;ioned by the violent exerci&s;e and the frequent extremes of heat and cold to which they are expo&s;ed. Tho&s;e who bear heavy burdens, as porters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are obliged to draw in the air with much greater force, and al&s;o to keep their lungs di&s;tended with more violence than is nece&s;&s;ary for common re&s;piration: By this means the tender ve&s;&s;els of the lungs are over di&s;tended. and often bur&s;t, in&s;omuch that a &s;pitting of blood or fevers en|&s;ues. Hippocrates mentions an in&s;tance to this purpo&s;e of a man. who, upon a wager, had carried an a&s;s. The man, he &s;ays, was immediately &s;eized with a fever, a vo|miting of blood, and a rupture.</P>
<P>CARRYING very heavy burdens is often the effect of mere indolence, which prompt people to do at once, what &s;hould be done at twice. It likewi&s;e proceeds frequently from bravado, or an emulation to outdo others. Hence it is that the &s;tronge&s;t men are mo&s;t generally hurt by heavy burdens, hard labour, or feats of activity. It is rare to find one who excels in this way, without a hernia, a haemoptoe, or &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;e, which he enjoys as the fruit of his fol|ly.
<PB N="75" REF="012338_0079_0F88EDAEEDCD5F50">
One would imagine, that the daily in&s;tances we have of the fatal effects of carrying great weights, running, wre&s;tling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould be &s;ufficient to put a &s;top to &s;uch practices.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed &s;ome employments which nece&s;&s;arily require a violent exertion of &s;trength, &s;uch as black&s;miths, carpenters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> None ought to follow the&s;e occupations but men of a &s;trong body; and they &s;hould never exert their &s;trength to the utmo&s;t, nor work too long. When the mu&s;cles are violently &s;trained, frequent re&s;t is nece&s;&s;ary, in order that they may recover their tone; where that is ne|glected, the &s;trength and con&s;titution will &s;oon be wore out, and a premature old age brought on.</P>
<P>THE quin&s;y and eri&s;ipelas, or St. Anthony's fire, are likewi&s;e di&s;ea&s;es very incident to the laborious. The&s;e are occa&s;ioned by whatever gives a &s;udden check to the per&s;pi|ration, as drinking cold liquor when the body is warm, keeping on wet cloaths, &s;itting or lying on the cold ground, damp hou&s;es, wet feet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As the great dan|ger of the&s;e practices has already been pointed out, it is un|nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t upon them here.</P>
<P>THE laborious are often afflicted with the iliac pa&s;&s;ion, the colic, and other complaints of the bowels. The&s;e are often occa&s;ioned by wet feet, or wet cloaths; but they more generally proceed from flatulent and indige&s;table food. Labourers eat unfermented bread made of peas, beans, rye, and other windy ingredients. They al&s;o eat great quanti|ties of unripe fruits, baked, &s;tewed, or raw, with various kinds of roots and herbs, upon which they drink &s;our milk, &s;tale &s;mall beer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such a compo&s;ition cannot fail to fill the bowels with wind, and occa&s;ion di&s;ea&s;es. Ac|cordingly we find the&s;e people in the decline of life univer|&s;ally complaining of flatulencies; a di&s;order which renders many of them very unhappy, and for which no cure is yet known. The be&s;t advice that we can give them is to avoid windy food as far as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>INFLAMMATIONS, whitlows, and other di&s;ea&s;es of the ex|tremities, are very common among&s;t them who labour without doors. The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are often attributed to ve|nom, or &s;ome kind of poi&s;on; but they generally proceed either from &s;udden heat after cold, or the contrary. When &s;uch people come from the fields cold and wet, they run to the fire, and often plunge their hands in warm water, by which means the blood and other humours in the&s;e parts are &s;uddenly expanded, the ve&s;&s;els not yielding &s;o quickly,
<PB N="76" REF="012338_0080_0F88EDB08FF37F00">
a &s;trangulation happens, and an inflammation or mortificati|on en&s;ues.</P>
<P>WHEN labourers come home cold, they ought to keep at a di&s;tance from the fire for &s;ome time, to wa&s;h their hands in cold water, and to rub them well with a dry cloth. It &s;ometimes happens that people are &s;o benumbed with cold, as to lo&s;e the u&s;e of their limbs altogether. In &s;uch a ca&s;e the only remedy is to rub the parts affected with &s;now, or, failing it, with cold water. If they be held near the fire, or plunged into warm water, a mortification will certainly en|&s;ue.</P>
<P>LABOURERS in the hot &s;ea&s;on are apt to lie down and &s;leep in the &s;un. This practice is &s;o dangerous, that they often ri&s;e in a high fever. The burning fevers which prove &s;o fatal about the end of &s;ummer, and beginning of autumn, are often occa&s;ioned by this means. When la|bourers leave off work, which they ought always to do du|ring the heat of the day, they &s;hould go home, or, at lea&s;t, get under &s;ome cover, where they may repo&s;e them&s;elves in &s;afety.</P>
<P>THE different &s;ea&s;ons of the year expo&s;e tho&s;e who la|bour without doors to different di&s;ea&s;es. Thus in the &s;pring agues are frequent: in &s;ummer, as has been ob&s;erved, burning fevers abound; and in autumn, dy&s;enteries and fluxes prevail. The latter proceed not only from the per|&s;piration being, at that time, ob&s;tructed, but al&s;o from the green tra&s;h, or unripe fruits, which country people eat in great quantities. Indeed if fruit be ripe, and eat in mode|ration, it rather prevents than occa&s;ions dy&s;enteries; but it is equally certain, that much bad fruit will bring on a flux.</P>
<P>LABOURERS are often hurt by long fa&s;ting. They fre|quently follow their employments in the fields from morn|ing till night, without eating any thing. This cannot fail to hurt their health. However homely their fare be, they ought to have it at regular times, and the harder they work, the more frequently &s;hould they eat.</P>
<P>LABOURERS likewi&s;e &s;uffer from the nature of their food. They are extremely carele&s;s with re&s;pect to what they eat or drink, and often through mere indolence, eat unwhole&s;ome food, when they might, for the &s;ame expence, have that which is whole&s;ome. The poor often hurt their health for want of a proper method of living, and in the end &s;ave nothing by it. In many parts of Britain, the pea|&s;ants are too carele&s;s to take the trouble of dre&s;&s;ing their
<PB N="77" REF="012338_0081_0F88EDB1C4044648">
victuals, though they have feuel for nothing. Such peo|ple will live upon one meal a-day in indolence, rather than labour, though it were to procure them the greate&s;t afflu|ence.</P>
<P>POVERTY is doubtle&s;s a very general cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;es a|mong the labouring part of mankind. Few of them have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ch fore&s;ight; and if they had, it &s;eldom is in their power to lay any thing up again&s;t hard times. They are glad to make a &s;hift to live from day to day; and when any di&s;ea&s;e renders them unfit for work, their families are ready to &s;tarve. Here the God-like virtue of charity ought ever to exert her&s;elf. To relieve the indu&s;trious poor when in di&s;|tre&s;s, is &s;urely the mo&s;t exalted act of religion, and can never lo&s;e its reward. They alone who witne&s;s tho&s;e &s;cenes of calamity, can form a notion of what numbers pe|ri&s;h in di&s;ea&s;es for want of proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and even for want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life. It were to be wi&s;hed, for the honor of human nature, as well as for the good of &s;ociety, that the&s;e things were more looked into.</P>
<P>FEVERS of a very bad kind are often occa&s;ioned by what is called <HI>poor living.</HI> When the body is not &s;ufficiently nouri&s;hed, the humours become bad, and the &s;pirits &s;ink; from whence the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences mu&s;t ever en&s;ue. <HI>Poor living</HI> is likewi&s;e productive of cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es. It is remarkable that cattle, when pinched in their food, are generally affected with di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;kin. The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es &s;eldom fail to di&s;appear when they are put upon good pa|&s;ture: which &s;hews how much a good &s;tate of the humours depends upon a &s;ufficient quantity of proper nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>LABOURERS often &s;uffer from a fooli&s;h emulation, which prompts them to vie with one another, till they drop down dead, or over-heat them&s;elves to &s;uch a degree as to occa&s;i|on a fever. As this is the effect of vanity, it ought always to be checked by tho&s;e who have the &s;uperintendance of them. Such as wantonly throw away their lives in this manner, de&s;erve to be looked upon in no better light than &s;elf-murderers. It is pity that poor widows and father|le&s;s children &s;hould &s;uffer by &s;uch childi&s;h conduct: Could we &s;peak to the pa&s;&s;ions of men, we would bid them think of the&s;e, and then con&s;ider of how great importance their lives are.</P>
<P>THE office of a &s;oldier in time of war, may be ranked among&s;t laborious employments. Soldiers &s;uffer many hard&s;hips from the inclemency of &s;ea&s;ons, long marches,
<PB N="78" REF="012338_0082_0F88EDB22FE17240">
hunger, bad provi&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e occa&s;ion fevers, flux|es, rheumati&s;ms, and other fatal di&s;ea&s;es, which often do more execution than the &s;word, e&s;pecially when campaigns are continued too late in the &s;ea&s;on. One week of cold rainy weather will kill more men than many months when it is dry and warm.</P>
<P>EVERY commander &s;hould take care that his &s;oldiers be well clothed and well fed. He ought al&s;o to endeavour to put an end to the campaign in due &s;ea&s;on, and to provide his men with winter quarters that are dry and well-aired. The&s;e ea&s;y rules, with taking care to keep the &s;ick at a pro|per di&s;tance from tho&s;e in health, will go a great length in pre&s;erving the lives of the &s;oldiery.</P>
<P>IT is indeed to be regretted, that &s;oldiers &s;uffer no le&s;s by indolence and intemperance in time of peace, than from hard&s;hips in time of war. When men are idle, they will be vicious. It would therefore be of the greate&s;t importance, could a &s;cheme be formed for rendering the military in time of peace le&s;s vicious, more healthy, and more u&s;eful to &s;ociety. All tho&s;e de&s;irable objects might certainly be promoted by only employing them five or &s;ix hours every day, and advancing their pay in proportion. By this means idlene&s;s, the mother of vice, would not only be pre|vented, but the price of labour might be lowered. Public works, as harbours, canals, turn-pike roads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> might be made without hurting manufactures; and &s;oldiers might be enabled to marry, and bring up children.</P>
<P>A SCHEME of this kind might be &s;o conducted as to rai&s;e in&s;tead of depre&s;&s;ing the martial &s;pirit, provided the men were never allowed to work above a certain number of hours, and obliged always to work without doors. No &s;oldier &s;hould ever be allowed to work too long, nor per|mitted to follow any &s;edentary employment. Sedentary employments render men weak and effeminate, and quite unfit for the hard&s;hips of war; whereas working a few hours daily without doors would innure them to the wea|ther, brace their nerves, and promote their &s;trength and courage.</P>
<P>SAILORS may al&s;o be numbered among&s;t the laborious. They undergo great hard&s;hips from change of climate, the violence of weather, hard labour, bad provi&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Sai|lors are of &s;o great importance both to the trade and &s;afety of this kingdom, that too much pains can never be be&s;towed in pointing out the proper means of pre&s;erving their lives.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="012338_0083_0F88EDB675D138C0">
EXCESS is one great &s;ource of the di&s;ea&s;es of &s;ea-faring people. When they get on &s;hore, after being long at &s;ea, without regard to the climate, or their own con&s;titutions, they plunge headlong into all manner of riot, and often per|&s;i&s;t till a fever puts an end to their lives. Thus intemperance, and not the climate, is often the cau&s;e why &s;o many of our brave &s;ailors die on foreign coa&s;ts. We would not have &s;ea-faring people live too low; but they will find tempe|rance the be&s;t defence again&s;t fevers, and many other ma|ladies.</P>
<P>SAILORS when on duty are often expo&s;ed to cold and wet. When that happens, they &s;hould change their cloaths as &s;oon as they are relieved, and take every proper method to re&s;tore the per&s;piration. In this ca&s;e they &s;hould not have recour&s;e to &s;pirits, or other &s;trong liquors, but &s;hould rather drink &s;uch as are weak and diluted, of a proper warmth, and go immediately to bed, where a &s;ound &s;leep and a gentle &s;weat will &s;et all to rights.</P>
<P>THE health of &s;ailors &s;uffers mo&s;t from unwhole&s;ome food. The con&s;tant u&s;e of &s;alted provi&s;ions vitiates the whole humours, and occa&s;ions the &s;curvy, and other ob&s;ti|nate maladies. It is no ea&s;y matter to prevent this di&s;ea&s;e in long voyages; yet we cannot help thinking, that much might be done towards effecting &s;o de&s;irable an end, were due pains be&s;towed for that purpo&s;e. For example, various roots, greens, and fruits might be kept a long time at &s;ea, as potatoes, cabbages, lemons, oranges, tamarinds, apples, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When fruits cannot be kept the juices of them either fre&s;h or fermented, may. With the&s;e all the drink, and even the food of the &s;hips company, ought to be acidulated in long voyages. But &s;uppo&s;e the vegetable acids &s;hould fail, yet the chymical, as cream of tartar, elixir of vitriol, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be kept for any length of time; and as they are attended with no expence, it is in the power of every &s;ailor to lay in enough of the&s;e for the longe&s;t voyage.

<P>STALE bread and beer likewi&s;e contribute to vitiate the humours. Meal will keep for a long while on board, of which fre&s;h bread might frequently be made.

This liquor, when drank even in the form of wort, is very whole&s;ome, and is found to be an excellent antidote again&s;t the &s;curvy. Small wines and cyder might

<HEAD>The SEDENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH nothing can be more contrary to the nature of man than a &s;edentary life, yet the far greater part of the human &s;pecies are comprehended under this cla&s;s. Almo&s;t the whole female world, and, in manufacturing countries, the major part of the males, may be reckoned &s;edentary.</P>
<P>AGRICULTURE, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t healthful of all em|ployments, is now followed by few who are able to carry on any other bu&s;ine&s;s. Tho&s;e who imagine that the culture of the earth is not &s;ufficient to employ all its inhabitants, are greatly mi&s;taken. An ancient Roman, we are told, could maintain his family from the produce of one acre of ground. So might a modern Briton, if he could be con|tented to live like a Roman. This &s;hows what an immen&s;e increa&s;e of inhabitants Britain might admit of, and all of them live by the culture of the ground. Agriculture is the great &s;ource of dome&s;tic riches. It is of all employments the mo&s;t favourable to health and population. When it is neglected, whatever wealth may be imported from abroad, poverty, wretchedne&s;s, and mi&s;ery will abound at home. Such is, and ever will be, the fluctuating nature of manu|factures, that ten thou&s;and people may be in bread to-day, and in beggary to-morrow. This can never happen to tho&s;e who cultivate the ground. They can eat the fruit of their labour, and can always by indu&s;try obtain, at lea&s;t, the nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>THO' &s;edentary employments be nece&s;&s;ary, yet there &s;eems to be no rea&s;on why any per&s;on &s;hould be confined for life to the&s;e alone. Were &s;uch employments intermixed with the more active and laborious, they would never do hurt. It is con&s;tant confinement that ruins the health. A man many not be hurt by &s;itting four or five hours a-day, who, were he obliged to &s;it ten or twelve, would &s;oon con|tract di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT it is not want of exerci&s;e alone which hurts &s;edenta|ry people; they often &s;uffer from the unwhole&s;ome air which they breathe. It is very common to &s;ee ten or a do|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> taylors, or &s;tay-makers, for example, crouded into one &s;mall appartment, where there is hardly room for one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">gle per&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> freely. In this &s;ituation they gene|rally
<PB N="82" REF="012338_0086_0F88EDB8CCA4BD78">
continue for many hours at a time, with often the ad|dition of &s;undry candles, which help to wa&s;te the air, and render it le&s;s fit for re&s;piration. Air that is breathed over and over, lo&s;es its &s;pring, and becomes unfit for expanding the lungs. This is one cau&s;e of the phthi&s;ical coughs, and other complaints of the brea&s;t, &s;o incident to &s;edentary ar|tificers.</P>
<P>EVEN the per&s;piration from a great number of bodies pent up together, renders the air unwhole&s;ome. The danger from this quarter is greatly increa&s;ed, if any of them hap|pens to have bad lungs, or to be other ways di&s;ea&s;ed. Tho&s;e who &s;it near him, being forced to breathe the &s;ame air, can hardly fail to be infected. It would be a rare thing indeed to find a dozen of &s;edentary people all &s;ound. The danger of crouding them together mu&s;t therefore be evident to eve|ry one.</P>
<P>MANY of tho&s;e who follow &s;edentary employments are con&s;tantly in a bending po&s;ture, as &s;hoemakers, taylors, cutlers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such a &s;ituation is extremely hurtful. A bending po&s;ture ob&s;tructs all the vital motions, and of cour&s;e mu&s;t ruin the health. Accordingly we find &s;uch artificers generally complain of indige&s;tions, flatulencies, headaches, pains of the brea&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In &s;uch people the fir&s;t concoction is generally bad, and as that fault can never be mended in any of the &s;ub&s;equent ones, it cannot fail to induce a total vitium of the humours, which paves the way to innumerable di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>THE aliment in &s;edentary people, in&s;tead of being pu&s;h|ed forwards by an erect po&s;ture, the action of the mu&s;cles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is in a manner confined in the bowels. Hence co&s;tive|ne&s;s, wind, and other hypocondriacal &s;ymptoms, the never failing companions of the &s;edentary. Indeed none of the &s;ecretions can be duly performed where exerci&s;e is wanting, and when any one of the&s;e is retained too long in the body, it mu&s;t have bad effects, as it is again taken up into the ma&s;s of humours.</P>
<P>A bending po&s;ture is very hurtful to the lungs. When this organ is compre&s;&s;ed, the air cannot have free acce&s;s in|to all its parts, &s;o as to expand them properly. Hence tu|bercles, adhe&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are formed, which often end in con&s;umptions. The proper action of the lungs is like|wi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for making good blood. When that organ fails, the humours &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> univer&s;ally de|praved, and the whole con&s;titution go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to wreck. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fine, both the pectoral and abdominal vi&s;cera ought to be kept as free and ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible.

is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to life, and being of a &s;oft texture, their functions are ea&s;ily ob&s;tructed by any &s;ort of pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE &s;edentary are not only hurt by pre&s;&s;ure on the bow|els, but al&s;o on the inferior extremities, which ob&s;tructs the circulation in the&s;e parts, and renders them weak and feeble. Thus taylors, &s;hoemakers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> frequently lo&s;e the u&s;e of their legs altogether; be&s;ides the blood and other humours, by &s;tagnating in the&s;e parts, are vitiated; from whence proceed the &s;cab, ulcerous &s;ores, foul blotches, and other cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es, &s;o common among &s;edentary artificers.</P>
<P>A bad figure of body is a very common con&s;equence of clo&s;e application to &s;edentary employments. The &s;pine, for example, by being continually bent, puts on a crooked &s;hape, and generally remains &s;o ever after. But a bad fi|gure of body has already been ob&s;erved to be hurtful to health, as the vital functions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are thereby impeded.</P>
<P>A &s;edentary life never fails to occa&s;ion an univer&s;al relax|ation of the &s;olids. This is the grand &s;ource from whence mo&s;t of the di&s;ea&s;es of &s;edentary people flow. The &s;cro|fula, con&s;umption, rickets, and many other maladies which now abound, were little known in this country before &s;e|dentary artificers became &s;o numerous; and they are very little known &s;till among &s;uch of our people as follow active employments without doors, though in the great manufac|turing towns, at lea&s;t two thirds of the inhabitants are af|flicted with them.</P>
<P>IT is the more difficult to remedy tho&s;e evils, becau&s;e many who have been accu&s;tomed to a &s;edentary life, like rickety children, lo&s;e all inclination for exerci&s;e; we &s;hall however give a few hints with re&s;pect to the mo&s;t likely means for pre&s;erving the health of this u&s;eful &s;et of people, which &s;ome of them, we hope, will be wi&s;e enough to ob|&s;erve.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved, that &s;edentary artificers are often hurt by their bending po&s;ture. They ought therefore to &s;tand or &s;it as erect as the nature of their employments will permit. They &s;hould likewi&s;e change po&s;tures frequently, and &s;hould never &s;it too long at a time, but leave off work and walk, ride, run, or do any thing that will promote the vital functions.</P>
<P>SEDENTARY artificers are allowed too little time for ex|erci&s;e; yet, &s;hort as it is, they &s;eldom employ it properly. A journeyman taylor or weaver, in&s;tead of walking abroad
<PB N="84" REF="012338_0088_0F88EDBA2CA99BE8">
for exerci&s;e and fre&s;h air, at his hours of lei&s;ure, choo&s;es often to &s;pend them in a publick hou&s;e, or in pur&s;uing &s;ome &s;edentary diver&s;ion, at which he generally lo&s;es both his time and money.</P>
<P>THE awkward po&s;tures in which many &s;edentary artifi|cers work, &s;eem rather to be the effect of cu&s;tom than ne|ce&s;&s;ity. For example, a table might &s;urely be contrived for ten or a dozen taylors to &s;it round it, with liberty for their legs either to hang down, or re&s;t upon a foot-board, as they &s;hould choo&s;e. A place might be cut out in the table for every per&s;on to &s;it in, by which means his work would lie as ready to his hand, as in the pre&s;ent mode of &s;itting cro&s;s-legged.</P>
<P>WE would recommend to all &s;edentary artificers the mo&s;t religious regard to cleanline&s;s. Both their &s;ituation and oc|cupations render this highly nece&s;&s;ary. Nothing would contribute more to pre&s;erve &s;edentary artificers in health, than a &s;trict attention to this rule; and &s;uch of them as ne|glect it, not only run the hazard of lo&s;ing their health, but of becoming a nui&s;ance to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>SEDENTARY people &s;hould live &s;pare. They ought like|wi&s;e to avoid food that is windy, or hard of dige&s;tion, and &s;hould pay the &s;tricte&s;t regard to &s;obriety. A per&s;on who works hard without doors will &s;oon throw off an overcharge of liquor, but one who &s;its has by no means an equal chance. Hence it often happens, that &s;edentary people are &s;eized with fevers after hard drinking. When &s;uch people feel their &s;pirits low, in&s;tead of running to the tavern for relief, they &s;hould ride, or walk into the fields. This would remove the complaint more effectually than &s;trong li|quor, and would never hurt the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of multiplying rules for pre&s;erving the health of the &s;edentary, we &s;hall recommend the following general plan, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That every per&s;on who follows a &s;edentary em|ployment &s;hould cultivate a piece of ground with his own hands. This he might dig, plant, &s;ow, and weed at his lei&s;ure-hours, &s;o as to make it both an exerci&s;e and amu&s;e|ment, while it produced many of the nece&s;&s;aries of life. After working an hour in a garden, a man will return with more keenne&s;s to his employment within doors, than if he had been all the while idle.</P>
<P>LABOURING the ground is every way conducive to health. It not only gives exerci&s;e to every part of the body, but the very &s;mell of the earth and fre&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">bs, revive and
<PB N="85" REF="012338_0089_0F88EDBAE92DEE60">
chear the &s;pirits, whil&s;t the perpetual pro&s;pect of &s;ome|thing coming to maturity, delights and entertains the mind. We are &s;o made as to be always plea&s;ed with &s;ome|what in pro&s;pect, however di&s;tant or however trivial. Hence the happine&s;s that mo&s;t men feel in planting, &s;owing, building, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e &s;eem to have been the chief employ|ments of the early ages; and when kings and conquerors cultivated the ground, there is rea&s;on to believe, that they knew as well wherein true happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted as we do.</P>
<P>IT may &s;eem romantic to recommend gardening to ma|nufacturers in great towns; but ob&s;ervation proves, that the plan is very practicable. In the town of Sheffield, in York&s;hire, where the great iron manufacture is carried on, there is hardly a journeyman cutler who does not occupy a piece of ground which he cultivates as a garden. This practice has many &s;alutary effects. It not only induces the&s;e people to take exerci&s;e without doors, but al&s;o to eat many greens, roots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of their own produce, which they would not think of purcha&s;ing. There &s;eems to be no rea&s;on why manufacturers in any other town in Great-Britain &s;hould not follow this example.</P>
<P>MECHANICS are too much inclined to crowd into great towns. This &s;ituation may have &s;ome advantages, but ma|ny di&s;advantages. All mechanics who live in the country, have it in their power, and indeed mo&s;t of them do, occupy a piece of ground, which not only gives them exerci&s;e, but enables them to live more comfortably. So far at lea&s;t as our ob&s;ervation reaches, mechanics who live in the country are far more happy than tho&s;e in great towns. They enjoy better health, live in greater affluence, and &s;eldom fail to rear a healthy and numerous-offspring.</P>
<P>IN a word, exerci&s;e without doors, in one &s;hape or other, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to health. Tho&s;e who neglect it, though they may for a while drag out life, can hardly be &s;aid to enjoy it. Their humours are generally vitiated, their &s;olids relaxed and weak, and their &s;pirits low and de|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>The STUDIOUS.</HEAD>
<P>INTENSE thought is &s;o de&s;tructive to health, that few in|&s;tances can be produced of &s;tudious per&s;ons who live to an extreme old age. Hard &s;tudy always implies a &s;edentary life; and when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ant of exerci&s;e is joined to inten&s;e think|ing,
<PB N="86" REF="012338_0090_0F88EDBF8A5AE4E8">
the con&s;equences mu&s;t be bad. We have frequently known even a few months inten&s;e &s;tudy ruin an excellent con&s;titution, and bring on a train of nervous complaints, which never could be removed. Man is evidently not form|ed for continual thought more than for perpetual action, and would be as &s;oon worn out by the one as by the other.</P>
<P>SO great is the power of the mind over the body, that by its influence the whole vital motion may be accelerated or retarded, to almo&s;t any degree. Chearfulne&s;s and mirth quicken the circulation, and promote all the &s;ecretions; whereas &s;adne&s;s and profound thought never fail to retard them. Thus even a degree of thoughtfulne&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary to health. The perpetual thinker &s;eldom enjoys either health or &s;pirits; while the per&s;on who can hardly be &s;aid to think at all, &s;eldom fails to enjoy both. The mind, by a habit of thinking, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, lo&s;es the power of unbending it&s;elf. This may be called a di&s;ea&s;e of the mind, and &s;hould be as carefully guarded again&s;t as any o|ther malady.</P>
<P>PERPETUAL thinkers, as they are called, &s;eldom think to much purpo&s;e. Such people, in a cour&s;e of years, ge|nerally become quite &s;tupid, and exhibit a melancholy proof how readily the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings may be abu&s;ed. Thought, like all other things, when carried to extreme, becomes a vice. Hence nothing can afford a greater proof of wi&s;dom than for a man frequently and &s;ea&s;onably to un|bend his mind. This may always be done by a chearful company, active diver&s;ions, mu&s;ic, or the like.</P>
<P>THE gout is the common companion of the &s;tudious. This excruciating di&s;ea&s;e generally proceeds from indige&s;ti|ons, and an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration. It is impo&s;&s;ible that the man who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">its all day in a clo&s;et &s;hould either dige&s;t his food, or have any of the &s;ecretions in due quantity. When that matter, which &s;hould be thrown off by the &s;kin, is re|tained in the body, it cannot fail to vitiate the humours, and of cour&s;e to produce the gout, or &s;ome other malady.</P>
<P>THE &s;tudious are often afflicted with the &s;tone and gra|vel. Motion greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ts the &s;ecretion and di&s;charge of urine; con&s;equently a &s;edentary life mu&s;t have the contra|ry effect. Of this any one may be &s;en&s;ible by ob&s;erving, that he pa&s;&s;es much more urine by day than in the night, and al&s;o when he walks or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ides than when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">its.

are di&s;ordered, nature generally attempts to free her|&s;elf of the offending cau&s;e, by the urinary pa&s;&s;ages; but when the&s;e become unfit for performing their proper func|tions, this attempt mu&s;t fail, and con&s;equently di&s;ea&s;es will en&s;ue.</P>
<P>OBSTRUCTIONS of the liver prove often fatal to the &s;tu|dious. Di&s;ea&s;es of that organ are very ob&s;tinate, and gene|rally complicated. The circulation in the liver being &s;low, ob&s;tructions can hardly fail to be the con&s;equence of inactivity. Hence &s;edentary people are frequently afflicted with &s;chirrous livers, the jaundice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The proper &s;ecre|tion and di&s;charge of the bile is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a part of the animal oeconomy, that where it is not duly performed, the health mu&s;t needs be impaired. Indige&s;tion, lo&s;s of appe|tite, and a wa&s;ting of the whole body, &s;eldom fail to be the con&s;equences of a vitium, or ob&s;tructions of the bile.</P>
<P>FEW di&s;ea&s;es prove more fatal to the &s;tudious than con|&s;umptions of the lungs. It has already been ob&s;erved, that this organ cannot be duly expanded in tho&s;e who do not take proper exerci&s;e, and where that is the ca&s;e, ob&s;truc|tions, adhe&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t en&s;ue. Not only want of ex|erci&s;e, but the po&s;ture in which &s;tudious people often &s;it, is very hurtful to the lungs. Tho&s;e who read or write much are apt to contract a habit of bending forwards, and often pre&s;s with their brea&s;t upon a table or bench, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible this po&s;ture &s;hould fail to hurt the lungs. It ought therefore to be avoided with the utmo&s;t care.</P>
<P>THE &s;tudious are often afflicted with want of appetite and indige&s;tions. The&s;e lay the foundation of numerous di&s;ea&s;es. When the dige&s;tions fail, the humours mu&s;t &s;oon be depraved, to which &s;ucceed low &s;pirits, weak nerves, with the whole train of hy&s;teric and hypochondriac mala|dies.</P>
<P>HEADACHES often afflict the &s;tudious. The&s;e proceed from long and inten&s;e thinking, and &s;ometimes they are ag|gravated by co&s;tivene&s;s. The be&s;t way to prevent them is never to &s;tudy too long, and to keep the belly regular ei|ther by proper food, or taking frequently a little of &s;ome o|pening medicine.</P>
<P>Di&s;ea&s;es of the eyes often afflict the &s;tudious. Such therefore as read or write much &s;hould early accu&s;tom them&s;elves to u&s;e <HI>pre&s;erves.</HI> Night-&s;tudy is mo&s;t de&s;tructive to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, and &s;hould never be prolonged too late.

the whole body. Nothing more certainly ruins the health, than the practice of &s;pending tho&s;e hours in the clo&s;et which &s;hould be allotted to &s;leep. Studious per&s;ons will find their eyes greatly &s;trengthened by bathing them frequently in cold water, or brandy and water mixed.</P>
<P>THE drop&s;y is another of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which commonly affect the &s;tudious, and very often puts an end to their lives. It has already been ob&s;erved, that the &s;ecretions are gene|rally defective in the &s;tudious, and that various di&s;ea&s;es, a|mong which is the drop&s;y, are occa&s;ioned by the retention of the&s;e humours which ought to be thrown off in that way. Any per&s;on may ob&s;erve, that &s;itting makes his legs &s;well, and that this will go off by exerci&s;e; which clearly points out the method of prevention to all who can take it. To tho&s;e who cannot take exerci&s;e, we would recommend the u&s;e of the fle&s;h-bru&s;h, cold bathing, and &s;uch food as is of a bracing and &s;trengthening nature.</P>
<P>FEVERS, e&s;pecially of the nervous kind, are often the effect of &s;tudy. Nothing is &s;o de&s;tructive to the nerves as inten&s;e thought. It is able, in a manner, to unhinge the whole machine. It not only hurts the vital motions, but di&s;orders the mind it&s;elf. Hence a delirium, melancholy, and even madne&s;s, are often the effect of clo&s;e application to &s;tudy. There is no di&s;ea&s;e which can proceed either from a bad &s;tate of the humours, a defect of the u&s;ual &s;ecreti|ons, or a debility of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, which may not be brought on by inten&s;e thinking.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t afflicting of all the di&s;ea&s;es which attack the &s;tudious, are the hypochondriacal. The&s;e &s;eldom fail to be the companions of deep thought, and may rather be call|ed a complication of maladies than a &s;ingle one. To what a wretched pa&s;s are the be&s;t of men often reduced by the&s;e maladies? Their &s;trength and appetite fail. A per|petual gloom hangs over their minds. They live in the con&s;tant dread of death, and are continually in &s;earch of relief from medicine, where, alas! it is not to be found. This di&s;ea&s;e far exceeds all de&s;cription, and tho&s;e who la|bour under it, though they be often made the &s;ubject of ridicule, ju&s;tly claim our highe&s;t &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;i|on.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more prepo&s;terous than for any man to make &s;tudy his &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s. A mere &s;tudent is &s;eldom a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> u&s;eful member of &s;ociety. Indeed it rarely happens, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> an u&s;eful invention is the effect of &s;tudy. The farther that
<PB N="89" REF="012338_0093_0F88EDC26BD04730">
men dive into profound re&s;earches, they generally deviate the more from common &s;en&s;e, and too often lo&s;e &s;ight of it altogether. Hence it is that profound &s;peculations, in&s;tead of making men wi&s;er or better, generally render them mere &s;ceptics, and overwhelm them in doubt and uncer|tainty. All that is nece&s;&s;ary for man to know, in order to be happy, is ea&s;ily obtained, and the re&s;t, like the forbid|den tree, &s;erves only to increa&s;e his mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>STUDIOUS people, in order to relieve their minds; mu&s;t not only di&s;continue to read and write, but engage in &s;ome employment or amu&s;ement, that will &s;o far occupy the thought as to make them forget the bu&s;ine&s;s of the clo&s;et. A &s;olitary ride or walk are &s;o far from relieving the mind, that they rather encourage thought. Nothing can divert the mind, when it gets into a train of &s;erious thinking, but an attention to &s;ubjects of a more trivial nature. The&s;e, when compared with the other, prove a kind of play to the mind, and con&s;equently relieve it.</P>
<P>THINKING men are apt to contract a contempt for what they call trifling company. They are a&s;hamed to be &s;een with any but philo&s;ophers. This however is no proof of their being philo&s;ophers them&s;elves. No man de&s;erves the name of a philo&s;opher who is a&s;hamed to unbend his mind by a&s;&s;ociating with the cheerful and gay. Even the &s;ociety of children will relieve the mind, and expel the gloom which application to &s;tudy is too apt to occa&s;ion. It is re|markable, that &s;uch as have numerous families; whatever hard&s;hips they may labour under, are generally the mo&s;t cheerful and happy.</P>
<P>AS &s;tudious people are nece&s;&s;arily much within doors, they &s;hould make choice of a large and well-aired place for &s;tudy. That would not only prevent the bad effects which attend confined air, but would cheer the &s;pirits, and have a mo&s;t happy influence both on the body and mind. It is &s;aid of Euripides, the Tragedian, that he u&s;ed to re|tire to a dark cave to compo&s;e his tragedies; and of De|mo&s;thenes, the Grecian orator, that he cho&s;e a place for &s;tudy where nothing could either be heard or &s;een. With all deference to &s;uch venerable names, we cannot help con|demning this ta&s;te. A man may &s;urely think to as good purpo&s;e in an elegant apartment as in a cave; and may have as happy ideas where the all-cheering rays of the &s;un <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">der the air whole&s;ome, as in places where they never reach.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="012338_0094_0F88EDC32E349D00">
THOSE who read or write much &s;hould be very attentive to their po&s;ture. They ought to &s;it and &s;tand by turns, always keeping as near an erect po&s;ture as po&s;&s;ible. Tho&s;e who dictate may do it walking. It has an excellent effect frequently to read or &s;peak aloud. This not only exerci&s;es the lungs, but almo&s;t the whole body, Hence &s;tudious people are greatly benefited by delivering di&s;cour&s;es in pub|lic. Such indeed &s;ometimes hurt them&s;elves by over-act|ing their part; but that is their own fault. The man who dies a martyr to mere vociferation merits not our &s;ympa|thy.</P>
<P>THE morning has by all medical writers been reckoned the be&s;t time for &s;tudy. It is &s;o. But it is al&s;o the mo&s;t proper &s;ea&s;on for exerci&s;e, while the &s;tomach is empty, and the &s;pirits refre&s;hed with &s;leep. Studious people &s;hould therefore frequently &s;pend the morning in &s;ome manly diver|&s;ion abroad. This would make them return to &s;tudy with greater alacrity, and would be of more &s;ervice than twice the time after their &s;pirits are worn out with fatigue. It is not &s;ufficient to take diver&s;ion only when we can think no longer. Every &s;tudious per&s;on &s;hould make it a part of his bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;hould let nothing interrupt his hours of re|creation more than tho&s;e of &s;tudy.</P>
<P>MUSIC has a mo&s;t happy effect in relieving the mind. It would be well if every &s;tudious per&s;on were &s;o far ac|quainted with that &s;cience as to amu&s;e him&s;elf after &s;evere thought, by playing &s;uch airs as have a tendency to rou&s;e the &s;pirits, and in&s;pire cheerfulne&s;s and good humour.</P>
<P>STUDIOUS per&s;ons generally &s;pend their mornings in the clo&s;et, and their evenings in company. It were better to invert this rule. It is the reproach of learning, that &s;o ma|ny of her &s;ons, to relieve the mind after &s;tudy, betake them&s;elves to the u&s;e of &s;trong liquors. This indeed is a remedy; but it is a de&s;perate one, and always ends in de|&s;truction. Would &s;uch per&s;ons, when their &s;pirits are low, get on hor&s;e-back, and gallop ten or a dozen miles, they would find it a more effectual remedy than all the &s;trong liquors in the world. A good hor&s;e is the be&s;t preventive medicine that we can recommend to the &s;tudious. This is better than all the nervous antidotes of the &s;hops, and will in the end be found much cheaper.</P>
<P>IT is really to be regretted that men, while in health, pay &s;o little regard to the&s;e things! How common is it to &s;ee a wretch, over-run with nervous di&s;ea&s;es, bathing,
<PB N="91" REF="012338_0095_0F88EDC3F6CFFB80">
walking, riding, and in a word, doing every thing for health after it is gone; yet if any one had recommended the&s;e things by way of prevention, his advice would have been treated with contempt, or, at lea&s;t, with neglect. Such is the weakne&s;s of human nature, and &s;uch the folly and want of fore&s;ight, even of tho&s;e who ought to be the wi&s;e&s;t of mankind!</P>

<HEAD>OF DISTINGUISHING DISEASES.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to the particular treatment of di&s;ea&s;es, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to lay down &s;ome gene|ral rules for di&s;tingui&s;hing one di&s;ea&s;e from another, as the danger of mi&s;taking the di&s;ea&s;e often deters people from at|tempting to relieve the &s;ick.</P>
<P>TO di&s;tingui&s;h di&s;ea&s;es is the mo&s;t difficult part of the practice of phy&s;ic. So near a re&s;emblance do the &s;ymptoms of one di&s;ea&s;e often bear to tho&s;e of another, that they may deceive the mo&s;t &s;kilful phy&s;ician. We do not mean in this place to give the di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of every par|ticular di&s;ea&s;e, but only to put the reader upon his guard by pointing out a few of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which have the neare&s;t re&s;emblance to one another, and which the unwary and inattentive may be mo&s;t apt to mi&s;take.</P>
<P>THE &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les are both preceded by chil|ne&s;s and &s;hivering, with heat and cold by turns, a quick pul&s;e, great thir&s;t, and other &s;ymptoms of a fever. In both the eruption appears about the third or fourth day in little &s;pots re&s;embling flea-bites. Thus far the di&s;ea&s;e cannot be certainly known; but on the &s;econd or third day from the eruption, the &s;mall-pox begin to ri&s;e and to fill with matter; which plainly &s;hows the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE petechial or &s;potted fever, may be known from the miliary by this mark, that in the former the &s;pots never ri&s;e above the &s;kin; whereas in the latter the &s;kin is rough, and before the eruption appears the patient complains of chil|ne&s;s, itching in the &s;kin, and oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>THOUGH there be a great &s;imilarity in the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of all fevers, yet an attentive ob&s;erver may generally di&s;co|ver to what cla&s;s they belong. Thus a burning fever may
<PB N="93" REF="012338_0097_0F88EDC575802EA8">
be known by the inten&s;e heat of the whole body, a dry parched &s;kin, a chapt tongue, and unquenchable thir&s;t. An inflammatory fever generally affects one particular part, as the lungs, the &s;tomach, the brain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This kind of fever has a natural tendency to a mortification. Malignant fevers are generally owing to infection. They may be known by the patient's &s;udden lo&s;s of &s;trength, perpetual watching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A catarrhal fever is known by a running at the no&s;e, a hoar&s;ene&s;s, and a &s;en&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ulne&s;s in the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>THE peripneumony and pleuri&s;y may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by this, that in the latter the pain is more acute, and in the former the oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t, and difficulty of breathing are greater, and the &s;pittle is generally tinctured with blood.</P>
<P>INTERMITTENT fevers or agues are known by their leaving the patient, and returning at certain periods, as once a day, once in two days, three days, or the like. They are denominated from the &s;pace between the fits, as quotidian, or every day agues, tertian, or &s;uch as return every other day, quartan, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>A hectic fever may be known by its &s;upervening to &s;ome other di&s;order, as the drop&s;y, con&s;umption, &s;curvy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It differs from a &s;low fever in this, that the pul&s;e is always quick, but remarkably &s;o in the morning; whereas the pul&s;e in a &s;low fever is more natural in a morning, and be|fore meals, though it be more quick after eating: Be&s;ides, in a &s;low fever the weakne&s;s is not &s;o great as in a hec|tic.</P>
<P>AN inflammation of the &s;tomach may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a cardialgia, an inflammation of the liver, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by a &s;en&s;e of the mo&s;t inten&s;e heat in the &s;tomach, a fever at|tended with a quick, unequal and weak pul&s;e, and a prodigious unea&s;ine&s;s upon taking any thing into the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>AN inflammation in the concave part of the liver may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the ba&s;tard pleuri&s;y, by the fever be|ing le&s;s violent, the breathing ea&s;ier, and the pain lower down. Be&s;ides, the ba&s;tard pleuri&s;y generally goes off on the &s;eventh day; whereas the inflammation of the liver is a tedious di&s;ea&s;e, and often ends in an ab&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;s, which occa&s;i|ons a hectic fever or a drop&s;y, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>A phrenzy, or inflammation of the membranes of the brain, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from madne&s;s, a common de|lirium, the hydrophobia, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by the burning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ever, the continual watching, and the violent pul&s;ation of the arte|ries
<PB N="94" REF="012338_0098_0F88E9EBEF777570">

about the head and temples, which always attend it. It differs from a delirium in being more violent, from mad|ne&s;s in being an accute di&s;ea&s;e, and from the hydrophobia in this, that the patient has no aver&s;ion from liquids.</P>
<P>A nephritis, or inflammation of the kidneys, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a fit of the gravel, by a fixed, dull, pre&s;&s;ing pain in the loins, which continues long; whereas the pain in a fit of the gravel is more violent, le&s;s fixed, and generally extends downwards.</P>
<P>EXTERNAL inflammations are ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed. An <HI>ery&s;ipelas,</HI> or St. Anthony's fire, only affects the &s;kin with redne&s;s, tumour and pain; whereas a <HI>phlegmon</HI> reaches to the &s;ubjacent mu&s;cles, and a <HI>gangrene</HI> penetrates not only the mu&s;cles, but even the tendinous and nervous parts, and is attended with great heat, pain, and redne&s;s, which at length change into a livid or black colour.</P>
<P>A &s;tone de&s;cending by the uriters may ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken for a fit of the colic, as both are attended with violent pain, vomiting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the former, however, the pain is more fixed in the loins, is attended with &s;hiverings, and as the &s;tone de&s;cends, the pain reaches downwards, and occa&s;ions a numbne&s;s of the thigh on the &s;ide affected; there is al&s;o a frequent inclination to pa&s;s water, with &s;ome degree of &s;trangury; whereas in the colic the pain is chiefly about the navel, and the belly is generally di&s;tended with wind.</P>
<P>THE gout may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the rheumati&s;m by its attacking the extremities chiefly, and being attended with a greater inflammation, and more violent pain. It may likewi&s;e be di&s;tingui&s;hed from venereal pains, by its being more violent in the day; whereas they are mo&s;t &s;evere in the night.</P>
<P>THE piles may be mi&s;taken for a dy&s;entary, as both tinge the &s;tools with blood, though the one be a dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, and the other in many ca&s;es a &s;alutary evacuation. In the piles however the blood flows without pain or gripes; whereas in the dy&s;entary the &s;tools are attended with the mo&s;t violent gripes, &s;pa&s;ms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>COUGHS may be owing to cold, an ulcer in the lungs, an a&s;thma, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The be&s;t way to di&s;tingui&s;h them is to examine into the cau&s;e, to ob&s;erve what the patient &s;pits, and to mark the continuance of the di&s;ea&s;e. A cough occa|&s;ioned by catching cold is generally attended with a di&s;|charge of phlegm, and is &s;eldom of long continuance. That
<PB N="95" REF="012338_0099_0F88E9B76E5FF6A8">
which is owing to an ulcer of the lungs is generally attend|ed with an hectic fever, and the &s;pittle is mixed with matter. An a&s;thmatic cough is generally owing to wind or &s;pa&s;ms, and &s;eldom admits of relief from medicine.</P>
<P>A headach, which proceeds from too great a quantity of blood being forced into the ve&s;&s;els of the brain, is gene|rally attended with heat, redne&s;s, and a &s;welling of the face, a great pul&s;ation of the arteries of the neck, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That kind of headach, which is the effect of venereal con|tageon, may be known by its being generally wor&s;t in the night. When the headach is owing to an effu&s;ion of &s;erum or blood into the &s;inuo&s;ities of the bones of the forehead, the pain is ob&s;tinate, &s;harp and fixed; it is generally &s;ituated in the bottom of the forehead, and above the eyes. When the head is di&s;ordered from crudities in the &s;tomach or wind, it may be known from belching, and the increa&s;e of the di&s;order upon u&s;ing flatulent food, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>AN apoplexy may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a &s;yncope or fainting fit, by the colour of the face, the breathing, and the pul&s;e continuing much the &s;ame as in health; whereas in a &s;yncope the pul&s;e and breathing are imperceptible, the face is pale, and the body grows cold. An apoplexy may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a catalep&s;y, becau&s;e the latter comes on &s;uddenly, and keeps the member quite rigid, and in the &s;ame po&s;ture as at the time of the attack</P>
<P>A proper attention to the age, &s;ex, con&s;titution, temper of mind, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the patient would greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t us in find|ing out and di&s;tingui&s;hing di&s;ea&s;es. Thus, in children the fibres are lax and &s;oft; in adults, rigid and ten&s;e. In young people the nerves are extremely irritable, and the flu|ids thin. In old age the nerves become almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, and many of the ve&s;&s;els imperviable. The&s;e, and number|le&s;s other peculiarities, render the di&s;ea&s;es of the young and tho&s;e of the aged very different; and of cour&s;e they mu&s;t re|quire different treatment.</P>
<P>NOT only the age, but al&s;o the &s;ex of the patient, claims our attention. Females are liable to many peculiar di&s;ea&s;es. Their nervous &s;y&s;tem being weak and delicate, they are ea&s;ier affected with &s;pa&s;tic or convul&s;ive di&s;orders than males. This is the true &s;ource of mo&s;t of the di&s;ea&s;es of the fair &s;ex, and ought always to be kept in view in the treat|ment of their di&s;orders.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="012338_0100_0F88E9B840180858">
WE ought likewi&s;e to attend to the particular con&s;tituti|on. This not only predi&s;po&s;es per&s;ons to peculiar di&s;ea&s;es, but likewi&s;e makes it nece&s;&s;ary, that their di&s;ea&s;es be treat|ed in a very different manner. For example, a delicate per&s;on with weak nerves, can neither bear bleeding, nor any other evacuation, to the &s;ame extent as one who&s;e con|&s;titution is hardy and robu&s;t.</P>
<P>THE temper of mind ought likewi&s;e to be attended to in di&s;ea&s;es. Fear, anxiety, and a fretful temper both occa&s;i|on and aggravate di&s;ea&s;es. The medicine of the mind is too little regarded. In vain do we apply medicines to the body to remove di&s;ea&s;es which proceed from the mind. When that is the ca&s;e, the be&s;t medicine is to &s;ooth the pa&s;&s;ions, divert the mind from anxious thought, and to cheri&s;h the hopes of the patient.</P>
<P>ATTENTION ought likewi&s;e to be paid to the place where the patient lives, the air he breathes, his diet, occu|pation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such as live in low mar&s;hy countries, are &s;ubject to many di&s;ea&s;es which are unknown to the inhabi|tants of the high countries. Tho&s;e who breathe the im|pure air of cities have many maladies, to which the more happy ru&s;tics are &s;trangers. Such as feed gro&s;s, and indulge in &s;trong liquors are liable to di&s;ea&s;es which do not affect the temperate and ab&s;temious. The &s;ituation of life, as has been ob&s;erved, likewi&s;e predi&s;po&s;es men to peculi|ar di&s;ea&s;es. Thus the laborious, the &s;edentary, the &s;tudi|ous, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are liable to particular maladies from the very oc|cupations which they follow.</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to enquire whether or not the patient has been guilty of any exce&s;s in eating or drinking, if he has over&s;trained him&s;elf, has drank cold liquor when he was warm, lain on the damp ground, changed his u&s;ual cloathing, or, in a word, done any thing that might ob|&s;truct the per&s;piration. It will al&s;o be proper to inquire, if any u&s;ual evacuation, as &s;weating of the feet, i&s;&s;ues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> has been &s;topped. The &s;tate of the belly &s;hould likewi&s;e be enquired into. Co&s;tivene&s;s alone will occa&s;ion di&s;ea&s;es, and the removing of it will cure them.</P>
<P>IT is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to inquire what di&s;ea&s;es the pati|ent has formerly been mo&s;t liable to, and what medicines were mo&s;t beneficial. If medicines have been admini&s;tered, it will be proper to enquire into their effect. It will like|wi&s;e be nece&s;&s;ary to inquire, what kind of medicines are
<PB N="97" REF="012338_0101_0F88E9B991101290">
mo&s;t agreeable to the patient, or if he has an aver&s;ion to any particular drug, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IT is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to inquire whether the patient can perform with ea&s;e all the animal and vital functions, or which of them gives him pain; and al&s;o to inquire, if all the different &s;ecretions go duly on, as the per&s;piration, di&s;|charge of urine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE nature of the di&s;ea&s;e is likewi&s;e to be inquired into, as whether it be primary or &s;econdary; whether &s;imple or complicated with &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;e; whether it be exter|nal or internal&punc; whether epidemic or not; whether it be the effect of age, intemperance, infection, or owing to a vitiated &s;tate of the humours, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OF FEVERS IN GENERAL.</HEAD>
<P>A Fever is the mo&s;t general di&s;ea&s;e incident to mankind. It attacks every age, &s;ex, and con&s;titution, and effects every part of the body; nor is the mind it&s;elf free from its influence. A fever is known by a quick pul&s;e, an increa&s;ed heat, and a difficulty in performing &s;ome of the vital or ani|mal functions, as breathing, walking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>FEVERS are divided into continual, remitting, and inter|mitting. By a continual fever is meant that which never leaves the patient during the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, or which &s;hews no remarkable increa&s;e or abatement in the &s;ymptoms. This kind of fever is likewi&s;e divided into acute, flow, and malignant. The fever is called <HI>acute,</HI> when its progre&s;s is quick, and the &s;ymptoms violent; but when the&s;e are more gentle, it is generally denominated <HI>flow.</HI> When livid or petechial &s;pots, &s;how a putrid &s;tate of the humours, the fever is called <HI>malignant, putrid,</HI> or <HI>pete|chial.</HI></P>
<P>A remitting fever differs from a continual, only in de|gree. It has frequent increa&s;es and decrea&s;es, or exacerba|tions and remi&s;&s;ions, but never wholly leaves the patient during the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. Intermitting fevers, or agues, are tho&s;e which, during the time that the patient may be &s;aid to be ill, have evident intervals or remi&s;&s;ions of the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>AS a fever is nothing el&s;e but an effort of nature to free her&s;elf from an offending cau&s;e, it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e who have the care of the &s;ick, to ob&s;erve with diligence
<PB N="98" REF="012338_0102_0F88E9B9DC9FD1E0">
which way nature points, and to endeavour to a&s;&s;i&s;t her ope|rations. Our bodies are &s;o framed as to have a con&s;tant ten|dency to expel or throw off whatever is injurious to health. This is generally done by urine, &s;weat, &s;tool, expectoration, vomit, or &s;ome other evacuation.</P>
<P>THERE is rea&s;on to believe, if the efforts of nature, at the beginning of a fever, were duly attended to and pro|moted, it would &s;eldom continue longer than twenty-four hours; but when her attempts are either neglected, or counteracted, it is no wonder if the di&s;ea&s;e be prolonged. There are daily in&s;tances of per&s;ons, who, after catching cold, have all the &s;ymptoms of a beginning fever; but by keeping warm, drinking diluting liquors, bathing their feet in warm water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the &s;ymptoms in a few hours di&s;appear, and the danger is prevented. In a word, almo&s;t every fever proceeding from an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, might be car|ried off, or its danger prevented, by timely care.</P>
<P>OUR de&s;ign is not to enter into a critical inquiry into the nature, cau&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of fevers, but to mark their mo&s;t ob|vious &s;ymptoms, and to point out the proper treatment of the patient with re&s;pect to his diet, drink, air, warmth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the different &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e. In the&s;e articles the inclinations of the patient will, in a great mea&s;ure, direct our conduct.</P>
<P>ALMOST every per&s;on in a fever complains of great thir&s;t, and calls out for drink, e&s;pecially of a cooling nature. This at once points out the u&s;e of <HI>water,</HI> which we may venture to call the greate&s;t febrifuge in nature. What is &s;o likely to abate the heat, attenuate the humours, remove &s;pa&s;ms and ob&s;tructions, promote per&s;piration, increa&s;e the quan|tity of urine, and, in &s;hort, produce every &s;alutary effect in an ardent or inflammatory fever, as drinking plentifully of warm water, thin gruel, or any other weak, diluting liquor, of which water is the ba&s;is? The nece&s;&s;ity of diluting li|quors is pointed out by the dry tongue, the parched &s;kin, and the burning heat, as well as by the unquenchable thir&s;t of the patient.</P>
<P>MANY cooling liquors, which are extremely grateful to patients in a fever, may be prepared from fruits, roots, and acid vegetables, as decoctions of tamarinds, apple-tea, orange-whey, and the like. Mucilaginous liquors might al&s;o be prepared from mar&s;h-mallow roots, lin&s;eed, lime-tree-buds, and many other vegetables. The&s;e liquors, e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="99" REF="012338_0103_0F88E9BB78898E78">
when acidulated, are highly agreeable to the patient, and &s;hould never be denied him.</P>
<P>AT the beginning of a fever, the patient generally com|plains of great la&s;&s;itude or wearine&s;s, and has no inclination to move. This evidently &s;hows the propriety of keeping him ea&s;y, and, if po&s;&s;ible, in bed; that relaxes the &s;pa&s;ms, abates the violence of the circulation, and gives nature an opportunity of exerting all her force to overcome the di&s;|ea&s;e. The bed alone would often remove a fever at the beginning; but when the patient &s;truggles with the di&s;|ea&s;e, in&s;tead of driving it off, he only fixes it the deeper, and renders it more dangerous. This ob&s;ervation is often veri|fied in travellers, who happen, when on a journey, to be &s;eized with a fever. Their anxiety to get home, induces them to travel with the fever upon them, which conduct &s;eldom fails to render it fatal.</P>
<P>IN fevers, the mind as well as the body &s;hould be kept ea&s;y. Company is &s;eldom agreeable to the &s;ick. Indeed, every thing that di&s;turbs the imagination increa&s;es the di&s;|ea&s;e&punc; for which rea&s;on, every per&s;on in a fever ought to be kept perfectly quiet, and neither allowed to &s;ee nor hear any thing that may in the lea&s;t affect or di&s;compo&s;e his mind.</P>
<P>THO' the patient in a fever has the greate&s;t inclination for drink, yet he &s;eldom has any appetite for &s;olid food; from whence we may &s;ee the impropriety of loading his &s;tomach with victuals. Much &s;olid food in a fever is every way hurtful to the patient. It oppre&s;&s;es nature, and in&s;tead of nouri&s;hing the patient, &s;erves only to feed the di&s;ea&s;e. What food the patient takes &s;hould be in &s;mall quantity, light, and ea&s;y of dige&s;tion. It ought to be chiefly of the vegetable kind, as water-pap, roa&s;ted apples, groat-gruel, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>POOR people, when any of their family are taken ill, run directly to their rich neighbours for cordials, and pour wines, &s;pirits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into the patient, who perhaps never had been accu&s;tomed to ta&s;te &s;uch liquors when in health. If there be any degree of fever, this conduct mu&s;t increa&s;e it, and if there be none, this is the ready way to rai&s;e one. Stuffing the patient with &s;weat-meats and other delicacies, is likewi&s;e very pernicious. The&s;e are always harder to di|ge&s;t then common food, and cannot fail to hurt the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more de&s;ired by a patient in a fever than fre&s;h air. It not only removes his anxiety, but cools the blood, revives the &s;pirits, and proves every way beneficial.
<PB N="100" REF="012338_0104_0F88E9BD2645FD28">
Many patients are in a manner &s;tiffled to death in fevers, for want of fre&s;h air; yet &s;uch is the unaccountable infa|tuation of many people, that the moment they think a per|&s;on in a fever, they imagine he &s;hould be kept in a clo&s;e chamber, into which not one particle of fre&s;h air mu&s;t be admitted. There ought to be a con&s;tant &s;tream of fre&s;h air into a &s;ick per&s;on's chamber, &s;o as to keep it always in a temperate degree of warmth, which ought never to be greater than is agreeable to one in perfect health.</P>
<P>NOTHING &s;poils the air of a &s;ick per&s;on's chamber, or hurts the patient more than a number of people breathing in it. When the blood is inflamed, or the humours in a putrid &s;tate, air that has been breathed over and over will greatly increa&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e. Such air not only lo&s;es its &s;pring, and becomes unfit for the purpo&s;es of re&s;piration, but acquires a noxious quality, which renders it in a man|ner poi&s;onous to the &s;ick.</P>
<P>IN fevers, when the patient's &s;pirits are low and depre&s;&s;ed, he is not only to be &s;upported with cordials, but every method &s;hould be taken to cheer and comfort his mind. Many, from a mi&s;taken zeal, when they think a per&s;on in danger, in&s;tead of &s;olacing his mind with the hopes and con&s;ola|tions of religion, fright him with the views of hell and damnation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It would be un&s;uitable here to dwell upon the impropriety and dangerous con&s;equences of this con|duct; it often hurts the body, and there is rea&s;on to be|lieve, &s;eldom benefits the &s;oul.</P>
<P>AMONGST common people, the very name of a fever ge|nerally &s;ugge&s;ts the nece&s;&s;ity of bleeding. This notion &s;eems to have taken its ri&s;e from mo&s;t fevers having been formerly of an inflammatory nature; but true inflammatory fevers are now &s;eldom to be met with. Sedentary occupa|tions, and a different manner of living, has &s;o changed the &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;es in Britain, that there is now hardly one fe|ver in ten where the lance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> is nece&s;&s;ary. In mo&s;t low, ner|vous, and putrid fevers, which are now &s;o common, bleed|ing is really hurtful, as it weakens the patient, and &s;inks his &s;pirits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We would recommend this general rule, never to bleed at the beginning of a fever, unle&s;s there be evident &s;igns of an inflammation. Bleeding is an excellent medi|cine when nece&s;&s;ary, but &s;hould never be wantonly per|formed.</P>
<P>IT is likewi&s;e a common notion, that it is always ne|ce&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e a &s;weat in the beginning of a fever. As fe|vers
<PB N="101" REF="012338_0105_0F88E9BD94D57348">
often proceed from an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, this no|tion is not ill founded. If the patient only lies in bed, bathes his feet and legs in warm water, and drinks freely of water-gruel, or any other weak, diluting liquor, he will &s;eldom fail to per&s;pire freely. The warmth of the bed, and the diluting drink, will relax the univer&s;al &s;pa&s;m, which generally affect the &s;olids at the beginning of a fever; it will open the pores, and promote the per&s;piration, by means of which the fever may often be carried off. But in|&s;tead of this, the common practice is to heap cloaths upon the patient, and to give him things of a hot nature, as &s;pi|rits, &s;piceries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which fire his blood, increa&s;e the &s;pa&s;ms, and render the di&s;ea&s;e more dangerous.</P>
<P>IN all fevers a proper attention &s;hould be paid to the pa|tient's longings. The&s;e are the calls of nature, and often point out what may be of real u&s;e. Patients are not to be wantonly indulged in every thing that the &s;ickly appetite may crave; but it is generally right to let them have a lit|tle of what they eagerly de&s;ire, though it may not &s;eem al|together proper. What the patient longs for, his &s;tomach will generally dige&s;t; and &s;uch things have &s;ometimes a very happy effect.</P>
<P>WHEN a patient is recovering from a fever, great care is is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent a relap&s;e. Many per&s;ons, by too &s;oon imagining them&s;elves well, have relap&s;ed, or contract|ed &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;e of an ob&s;tinate nature. As the body after a fever is weak and delicate, it is nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t catching cold. Moderate exerci&s;e in the open air will be of u&s;e; agreeable company will al&s;o have a good effect. The diet mu&s;t be light, but nouri&s;hing. It &s;hould be taken frequently, but in &s;mall quantities. It is very dangerous at &s;uch a time to eat as much as the &s;to|mach craves.</P>

<HEAD>OF INTERMITTING FEVERS OR AGUES.</HEAD>
<P>INTERMITTING fevers afford the be&s;t opportunity both of ob&s;erving the nature of a fever, and al&s;o the effects of medicine. No per&s;on can be at a lo&s;s to di&s;tingui&s;h an in|termitting fever from any other di&s;ea&s;e, and the proper me|dicine for it is now almo&s;t univer&s;ally known.</P>
<P>THE &s;everal kinds of intermitting fevers, as has been ob|&s;erved, take their names from the period in which the fit returns, as quotidians, tertians, quartans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="012338_0106_0F88E9B6E17F60E0">
CAUSES.&mdash;Agues are occa&s;ioned by moi&s;t air. This is evident from their abounding in rainy &s;ea&s;ons, and being mo&s;t frequent in countries where the &s;oil is mar&s;hy, as in Holland, the fens of Cambridge&s;hire, the Hundreds of E&s;&s;ex, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This di&s;ea&s;e is al&s;o occa&s;ioned by eating too much &s;tone-fruit, a poor watery diet, damp hou&s;es, even|ing dews, lying upon the wet ground, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When the inhabitants of a high country remove to a low one, they &s;eldom fail to catch an intermitting fever, and to &s;uch the di&s;ea&s;e is mo&s;t apt to prove fatal. In a word, whatever relaxes the &s;olids, dimini&s;hes the per&s;piration, or ob&s;tructs the circulation in the capillary or &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, predi&s;po&s;es the body to agues.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;An intermitting fever gene|rally begins with a pain of the head and loins, wearine&s;s of the limbs, coldne&s;s of the extremities, &s;tretching, yawning, with &s;ometimes great &s;ickne&s;s and vomitting; to which &s;ucceed &s;hivering and violent &s;haking. Afterwards the &s;kin becomes moi&s;t, and a profu&s;e &s;weat breaks out, which ge|nerally terminates the fit or paroxy&s;m. Sometimes, indeed, the di&s;ea&s;e comes on &s;uddenly, when the per&s;on thinks him|&s;elf in perfect health; but it is more commonly preceded by li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, lo&s;s of appetite, and the &s;ymptoms mention|ed above.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;While the fit continues, the patient may drink feely of water-gruel, orange-whey, weak camomile-tea; or, if his &s;pirits be low, &s;mall wine-whey, &s;harpened with the juice of lemon. His drink ought to be a little warm, as that will a&s;&s;i&s;t in bringing on the &s;weat, and con&s;equently &s;horten the paroxy&s;m.</P>
<P>BETWEEN the paroxy&s;ms the patient mu&s;t be &s;upported with food that is nouri&s;hing, but light and ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, as veal or chicken broths, &s;ago-gruel, with a little wine, light puddings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> His drink may be &s;mall negas, acidu|lated with the juice of lemons or oranges, and &s;ometimes a little weak punch. He ought al&s;o to drink infu&s;ions of bit|ters, as camomile, wormwood, or water trefoil tea, and may now and then take a gla&s;s of &s;mall wine, in which gentian root, centaury, or &s;ome other bitter, has been infu&s;ed.</P>
<P>AS the chief intentions of cure in an ague are to brace the &s;olids, and promote per&s;piration, the patient ought to take as much exerci&s;e between the fits as he can bear. If he be able to go abroad, riding on hor&s;eback, or in a machine, will be
<PB N="103" REF="012338_0107_0F88E9C096AC0BF0">
of great &s;ervice. But if he cannot bear that kind of exer|ci&s;e, he ought to take &s;uch as his &s;trength will permit. No|thing tends more to prolong an intermitting fever, than in|dulging a lazy, indolent di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>INTERMITTING fevers, under a proper regimen, will generally cure of them&s;elves; and when the di&s;ea&s;e is mild, in an open dry country, there is &s;eldom any danger from allowing it to take its cour&s;e; but when the patient's &s;trength is exhau&s;ted, and the paroxy&s;ms are &s;o violent, that his life is in danger, medicine ought immediately to be admini&s;tered. This however &s;hould never be done till the di&s;ea&s;e be properly formed, that is to &s;ay, till the pati|ent has had &s;everal fits of &s;haking and &s;weating.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;The fir&s;t thing to be done in the cure of an intermitting fever, is to clean&s;e the fir&s;t pa&s;|&s;ages. This not only renders the application of other me|dicines more &s;afe, but likewi&s;e more efficacious. In this di&s;ea&s;e the &s;tomach is generally overcharged with cold vi|&s;cid phlegm, and frequently great quantities of bile are di&s;charged by vomit; which plainly points out the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch evacuations. Vomits are therefore to be admini|&s;tered before the patient takes any other medicine. A do&s;e of ipecacuanha will generally an&s;wer this purpo&s;e very well. Half a dram of the powder will be &s;ufficient for an adult, and for a younger per&s;on the do&s;e mu&s;t be le&s;s in proportion. After the vomit begins to operate, it may be wrought off by drinking plentifully of weak camomile tea. The vomit &s;hould be taken two or three hours before the coming on of the fit, and may be rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ed two or three times at the di&s;tance of three or four days from each other. Vomits not only clean&s;e the &s;tomach, but increa&s;e the per|&s;piration, and all the other &s;ecretions, which render them of &s;uch importance, that they often cure intermitting fevers without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other medicine. Of this I have &s;een many in&s;tances, and remember my&s;elf to have been compleatly cured of a regular tertian, by taking two vomits of ipecacuanha, and ob&s;erving proper regimen.</P>
<P>PURGING medicines are likewi&s;e u&s;eful, and often ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in intermitting fevers. A &s;mart purge has been known to cure an ob&s;tinate ague, after the Je&s;uits bark and other medicines had been u&s;ed in vain. Vomits, how|ever, are more &s;uitable in this di&s;ea&s;e, and render purging le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary; but if the patient be afraid to take a vomit,
<PB N="104" REF="012338_0108_0F88E9C14AFAC2B0">
he ought in this ca&s;e to clean&s;e the bowels by a do&s;e or two of Glauber's &s;alts, jalap, or rhubarb, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>BLEEDING may &s;ometimes be proper at the beginning of an intermitting fever, when exce&s;&s;ive heat, a delirium, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> give rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect an inflammation; but as the blood is very &s;eldom in an inflammatory &s;tate in intermit|ting fevers, this operation is rarely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>AFTER proper evacuations, the patient may &s;afely u&s;e the Je&s;uits bark, which may be taken in any way that is mo&s;t agreeable to him. As it would an&s;wer no purpo&s;e to mul|tiply forms, we &s;hall only mention the following.</P>
<P>Two ounces of the be&s;t Je&s;uits bark, half an ounce of Virginian &s;nake-root, and a quarter of an ounce of ginger, all fine powdered, may be divided into twenty-four do&s;es. The&s;e may be either made into bolu&s;&s;es, as they are u&s;ed, with a little &s;yrup of lemon, or mixed in a gla&s;s of red wine, a cup of camomile-tea, water-gruel, or the like.</P>
<P>IN an ague which returns every day, a do&s;e of the above may be taken every two hours during the interval of the fit. By this method the patient will be able to take five or &s;ix do&s;es between each paroxy&s;m. In a tertian, or third-day ague, it will be &s;ufficient to take a do&s;e every third hour, during the interval, and in a quartan every fourth. If the patient cannot take &s;o large a do&s;e of the bark, he may di|vide each of the powders into two parts, and take one every hour. For a young per&s;on, a &s;maller quantity of this me|dicine will be &s;ufficient, and the do&s;e mu&s;t be adapted to the age, con&s;titution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE above will &s;eldom fail to remove an ague; but the patient ought not to leave off taking the medicine &s;o &s;oon as the paroxy&s;ms are &s;topped, but &s;hould continue to u&s;e it till &s;uch time as there is rea&s;on to believe the di&s;ea&s;e is in|tirely overcome. Mo&s;t of the failures in the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e are owing to the patients not continuing to u&s;e the medicine long enough. They are generally directed to take it till their fits are &s;topped, then to leave it off, and begin again at &s;ome di&s;tance of time; by which means the di&s;ea&s;e gathers &s;trength, and often returns with as much violence as before. A relap&s;e may always be prevented by the pa|tient's continuing to take &s;mall do&s;es of the medicine for &s;ometime after the &s;ymptoms di&s;appear. This is both the mo&s;t &s;afe and effectual method of cure.</P>
<P>THOUGH the bark alone will generally cure intermitting fevers; yet it may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by alkaline &s;alts, acid and
<PB N="105" REF="012338_0109_0F88E9C207406A30">
a&s;tringent vegetables, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Many have been cured of an intermitting fever, after the bark had failed, by taking twice or thrice a-day a dram of the &s;alt of wormwood in water-gruel. Some have &s;topped an ague by eating a boil|ed lemon, with the rind, immediately before the coming on of the fit. We would rather recommend a medicine which is the re&s;ult of the&s;e two when joined together, than either of them &s;eparately. Thus, a dram of &s;alt of wormwood may be di&s;&s;olved in an ounce and half of fre&s;h lemon juice, to which may be added three or four ounces of boiling water, and half a gla&s;s of brandy. The&s;e will make an agreeable medicine; a tea cupful of which may be taken three or four times a-day.</P>
<P>AN ounce of gentian root, calamus aromaticus, and orange-peel of each half an ounce, with three or four handfuls of camomile flowers, and an handful of coriander &s;eed, all brui&s;ed together in a mortar, may be u&s;ed in form of infu&s;ion or tea. About half an handful of the&s;e ingre|dients may be put into a tea-pot, and an Engli&s;h pint of boiling water poured on them. A cup of this infu&s;ion may be drank three or four times a-day. This &s;trengthens the &s;tomach, rectifies the blood, and greatly promotes the cure. Such patients as cannot drink the watery infu&s;ion, may put two handfuls of the &s;ame ingredients into a bottle of white wine, and take a gla&s;s of it twice or thrice a-day. If pa|tients drink freely of the above, or any other proper infu|&s;ion of bitters, a much &s;maller quantity of bark than is ge|nerally u&s;ed, will be &s;ufficient to cure an ague.</P>
<P>THERE is rea&s;on to believe, that &s;undry of our own plants or barks, which are very bitter and a&s;tringent, would &s;ucceed well enough in the cure of intermitting fe|vers, e&s;pecially when a&s;&s;i&s;ted by aromatics. But as the Je|&s;uits bark has been long approved in the cure of this di&s;|ea&s;e, and is now to be obtained at a very rea&s;onable rate, it is of le&s;s importance to &s;earch after new medicines. We cannot however omit taking notice, that the Je&s;uits bark is very often adulterated, and that it requires con&s;iderable &s;kill to di&s;tingui&s;h between the genuine and the fal&s;e. This ought to make people very cautious of whom they purcha&s;e it.</P>
<P>THOSE who cannot &s;wallow the bark in &s;ub&s;tance, may take it in decoction or infu&s;ion. An ounce of bark in pow|der may be infu&s;ed in a bottle of white wine for four or five days, frequently &s;haking the bottle, afterwards let the
<PB N="106" REF="012338_0110_0F88E9C2B6E84640">
powder &s;ub&s;ide, and pour off the clear liquor. A wine|gla&s;s may be drank three or four times a-day, or oftener, as there is occa&s;ion. If a decoction be more agreeable, an ounce of the bark, and two drams of &s;nakeroot brui&s;ed, with a dram of &s;alt of wormwood, may be boiled in a pro|per quantity of water, into half an Engli&s;h pint. To the &s;trained liquor may be added an equal quantity of red wine, and a gla&s;s of it taken thrice a-day, or oftener, if nece&s;&s;a|ry.</P>
<P>IN ob&s;tinate agues the bark will be found much more ef|ficacious when a&s;&s;i&s;ted by warm cordials, than if taken alone. This I have had frequently occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve in a country where intermitting fevers were endemical. The bark &s;eldom &s;ucceeded unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;nakeroot, ginger, canella alba, or &s;ome other warm aromatic. When the fits are very frequent and violent, in which ca&s;e the fever often approaches towards an inflammatory nature, it will be &s;afer to leave out the ginger, and to add in its place half a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ounce of &s;alt of wormwood. But in ob&s;tinate tertians or quartans, in the end of autumn, or beginning of winter, warm and cordial medicines are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>AS autumnal and winter agues generally prove much more ob&s;tinate than tho&s;e which attack the patient in &s;pring or &s;ummer; it will be nece&s;&s;ary to continue the u&s;e of medicines longer in the former than in the latter. A per&s;on who is &s;eized with an intermitting fever in the be|ginning of winter, ought frequently, if the &s;ea&s;on proves rainy, to take a little medicine, although the di&s;ea&s;e be cured, to prevent a relap&s;e, till the return of the warm &s;ea|&s;on. He ought likewi&s;e to take care not to be much abroad in wet weather, e&s;pecially in cold, moi&s;t, ea&s;terly winds.</P>
<P>WHEN agues are not properly cured, they often degene|rate into ob&s;tinate chronical di&s;ea&s;es; as the drop&s;y, jaun|dice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For this rea&s;on, all po&s;&s;ible care &s;hould be taken to have them radically cured, before the humours be vitiat|ed, and the con&s;titution &s;poiled.</P>
<P>THOUGH nothing is more rational than the method of treating intermitting fevers, yet, by &s;ome &s;trange Infatua|tion, more charms and whim&s;ical remedies are daily u&s;ed for removing this than any other di&s;ea&s;e. There is hardly an old woman who is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a no&s;trum for &s;topping an ague; and there is rea&s;on to fear, that many by tru&s;ting to them lo&s;e their lives. Tho&s;e in di&s;tre&s;s eagerly gra&s;p at any thing that promi&s;es &s;udden relief; but the &s;horte&s;t way

is not always the &s;afe&s;t in the treatment of di&s;ea&s;es. The only method to obtain a &s;afe and la&s;ting cure, is gradually to a&s;&s;i&s;t nature in removing the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>SOME people try bold, or rather fool-hardy experiments to cure agues, as drinking &s;trong liquors, jumping into a river, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e may &s;ometimes have the de&s;ired effect, but mu&s;t always be attended with danger. When there is any degree of inflammation, or the lea&s;t tendency to it, &s;uch experiments may prove fatal. The only per&s;on whom I remember to have &s;een die in an intermitting fever, evidently killed him&s;elf by drinking &s;trong liquor, which &s;ome per&s;on had per&s;uaded him would prove an infallible remedy.</P>
<P>MANY out of the way things are extolled for the cure of intermitting fevers, as cobwebs, &s;nuffings of candles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Though the&s;e may &s;ometimes &s;ucceed, yet their very na&s;ti|ne&s;s is &s;ufficient to &s;et them a&s;ide, e&s;pecially when cleanly medicines will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e better. The only medi|cine that can be depended upon, for thoroughly curing an intermitting fever, is the Je&s;uits bark. It may always be u&s;ed with &s;afety: And I can hone&s;tly declare, that in all my practice I never knew it fail, when properly applied, and duly per&s;i&s;ted in.</P>
<P>WHERE agues are endemical, even children are often afflicted with that di&s;ea&s;e. Such patients are very difficult to cure, as they can &s;eldom be brought to take the bark, or any other di&s;agreeable medicine. One method of ren|dering this medicine more palatable is, to make it into a mixture with di&s;tilled waters and &s;yrup, and afterward to give it an agreeable &s;harpne&s;s with the elixir of &s;pirit of vi|triol. This both improves the medicine, and takes off the nau&s;eous ta&s;te. The bark may be admini&s;tered to children in form of cly&s;ter when they will not take it by the mouth. Wine whey is a very proper drink for a child in an ague; to half an Engli&s;h pint of which may be put a tea-&s;poonful of the &s;pirit of hart&s;horn. Exerci&s;e is likewi&s;e of con&s;ider|able &s;ervice; and when the di&s;ea&s;e proves ob&s;tinate, the child ought, if po&s;&s;ible, to be removed to a warm dry air. Their food ought to be nouri&s;hing, and they &s;hould &s;ome|times have a little generous wine.</P>
<P>WE have been the more full upon this di&s;ea&s;e, becau&s;e it is very common, and becau&s;e few patients in an ague apply to phy&s;icians unle&s;s in extremities. There are, however, many ca&s;es in which the di&s;ea&s;e is very irregular, being
<PB N="108" REF="012338_0112_0F88E9C42D8EC010">
complicated with other di&s;ea&s;es, or attended with &s;ypmtoms which are both very dangerous, and difficult to under&s;tand. All the&s;e we have purpo&s;ely pa&s;&s;ed over, as they would on|ly bewilder the generality of readers. When the di&s;ea&s;e is very irregular, or the &s;ymptoms dangerous, the patient ought immediately to apply to a phy&s;ician, and &s;trictly to follow his advice.</P>
<P>TO prevent agues, people mu&s;t avoid their cau&s;es. The&s;e have been already pointed out in the beginning of this &s;ection; we &s;hall therefore only add one preventive medicine, which may be of u&s;e to &s;uch as are obliged to live in low mar&s;hy countries, or who are liable to frequent at|tacks of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>TAKE an ounce of the be&s;t Je&s;uits bark, half an ounce of Virginian &s;nake-root, and half an ounce of orange-peel, brui&s;e them all together, and infu&s;e for five or &s;ix days in a bottle of brandy, Holland-gin, or any good &s;pirit; afterwards pour off the clear liquor, and take a wine gla&s;s of it twice or thrice a day. This indeed is recom|mending a dram; but the bitter in a great mea&s;ure takes off the ill effects of the &s;pirit. Tho&s;e who do not choo&s;e it in brandy may infu&s;e it in wine; and &s;uch as can bring them|&s;elves to chew the bark, will find that method &s;ucceed very well. Gentian-root, or calamus aromaticus, may al&s;o be chewed by turns for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. All bitters &s;eem to be antidotes to agues, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are warm and a&s;tringent.</P>

<HEAD>OF AN ACUTE CONTINUAL FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS fever is denominated acute, ardent, or inflamma|tory. It mo&s;t commonly attacks the young, or tho&s;e about the prime or vigour of life, e&s;pecially &s;uch as live full, abound with blood, and who&s;e fibres are &s;trong and ela&s;tic. It &s;eizes people at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year; but is mo&s;t fre|quent in the &s;pring and beginning of &s;ummer.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;An ardent fever may be occa&s;ioned by any thing that overheats the body, as violent exerci&s;e, &s;leeping in the &s;un, drinking &s;trong liquors, eating &s;piceries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It may likewi&s;e be occa&s;ioned by any thing that ob&s;tructs the per&s;piration, as lying on the damp ground, drinking cold liquor when the body is hot, night-watching, or &s;uch like.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="012338_0113_0F88E9B22A993E30">
SYMPTOMS.&mdash;A rigor or chillne&s;s generally u&s;hers in this fever, which is &s;oon &s;ucceeded by great heat, a frequent and full pul&s;e, a pain of the head, dry &s;kin, redne&s;s of the eyes, a florid countenance, pains in the back, loins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To the&s;e &s;ucceed difficulty of breathing, &s;ick|ne&s;s, with an inclination to vomit. The patient complains of great thir&s;t, has no appetite for &s;olid food, is re&s;tle&s;s, and his tongue generally appears black and rough.</P>
<P>A delirium, exce&s;&s;ive re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, great oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t, with laborious re&s;piration, &s;tarting of the tendons, hiccup, cold, clammy &s;weats, and an involuntary di&s;charge of urine, are generally the forerunners of death.</P>
<P>AS this di&s;ea&s;e is always attended with danger, the be&s;t medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance ought to be procured as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. A phy&s;ician may be of u&s;e at the beginning, but his &s;kill is often of no avail afterwards.</P>
<P>WE cannot here omit, once for all, taking notice&punc; of the unaccountable conduct of tho&s;e who have it in their power, at the beginning of a fever, to procure the be&s;t medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet put off till things come to an extremity. When the di&s;ea&s;e, by delay or wrong treatment, has be|come incurable, and has exhau&s;ted the &s;trength of the pa|tient, it is in vain to hope for relief from medicine. Phy|&s;icians may indeed a&s;&s;i&s;t nature; but their attempts mu&s;t ever prove fruitle&s;s, when &s;he is no longer able to co-ope|rate with their endeavours.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;From the &s;ymptoms of this di&s;|ea&s;e, it is evident, that the blood mu&s;t be thick and vi&s;cous, by which its circulation thorough the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els is imped|ed; that the per&s;piration, urine, and all the other &s;ecretions, are in too &s;mall quantity; that the ve&s;&s;els are too rigid, and the heat of the whole body too great: All the&s;e clearly point out the nece&s;&s;ity of a regimen, calculated to dilute the blood, allay the exce&s;&s;ive heat, remove the &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture of the ve&s;&s;els, and promote the &s;ecretions.</P>
<P>THESE important purpo&s;es may be greatly promoted by drinking plentifully of diluting liquors, as thin water-gruel, oat-meal tea, clear whey, barley-water, balm-tea, apple-tea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e &s;hould be &s;harpened with juice of orange, jelly of currants, ra&s;pberries, and &s;uch like: Orange-whey is likewi&s;e an excellent cooling drink. It is made by boil|ing a bitter orange, &s;liced, among milk and water, till the curd &s;eparates. If no orange can be had, a lemon, a little cream of tartar, or a few &s;poonfuls of vinegar, will have
<PB N="110" REF="012338_0114_0F88E9C5168F9AB0">
the &s;ame effect. Two or three &s;poonfuls of white wine may be occa&s;ionally added to the liquor when boiling.</P>
<P>IF the patient be co&s;tive, an ounce of tamarinds, with two ounces of &s;toned rai&s;ins of the &s;un, and a couple of figs, may be boiled in three Engli&s;h pints of water to a quart. This makes a very plea&s;ant drink, and may be u&s;ed at di&s;|cretion. The common pectoral decoction is likewi&s;e a very proper drink in this di&s;ea&s;e. It is made by boiling barley, &s;toned rai&s;ins and figs, of each two ounces, with half an ounce of liquorice-root &s;liced, in two Engli&s;h quarts of water, till one half be con&s;umed. The barley &s;hould be boiled &s;ome time before the other ingredients are put in. This, with the addition of two or three drams of purified nitre, or &s;al-prunel, will not only be a proper drink, but prove an exceeding good medicine. A tea-cupful of it may be taken every two hours, or oftener, if the patient's heat and thir&s;t be very great.</P>
<P>THE above liquors mu&s;t all be drank a little warm. They may be u&s;ed in &s;maller quantities at the beginning of a fe|ver, but more freely afterwards, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t in carry|ing off the morbid matter by the different excretions. We have mentioned a variety of liquors, that the patient may have it in his power to choo&s;e that which is mo&s;t agreeable; and that, when tired of one, he may have recour&s;e to an|other.</P>
<P>THE patient's diet mu&s;t be very &s;pare and light. All &s;orts of meat, and even chicken-broths, are to be avoided. He may be allowed groat-gruel, panada, or light bread boil|ed in water, and afterwards &s;trained; to which may be add|ed a few grains of common &s;alt, and a little &s;ugar, which will render it more palatable. He may eat roa&s;ted apples with &s;ugar, toa&s;ted bread with jelly of currants &s;pread upon it, boiled prunes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IT will greatly relieve the patient, e&s;pecially in an hot &s;ea&s;on, to have fre&s;h air frequently let into his chamber, This, however, mu&s;t always be done in &s;uch a manner as not to endanger his catching cold.</P>
<P>IT is a common practice to load the patient with bed-cloaths, under the pretence of making him &s;weat, or de|fending him from the cold. This cu&s;tom has many ill ef|fects. It increa&s;es the heat of the body, fatigues the pa|tient, and retards, in&s;tead of promoting, the per&s;piration.</P>
<P>SITTING upright in bed, if the patient be able to bear it, will often have a good effect. It relieves the head, by re|tarding
<PB N="111" REF="012338_0115_0F88E9C6AB39A0C8">
the motion of the blood to the brain. But this po&s;|ture ought never to be continued too long: And if the pa|tient be inclined to &s;weat, it will be more &s;afe to let him lie &s;till, only rai&s;ing his head with pillows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>SPRINKLING the chamber with vinegar, juice of lemon, or vinegar and ro&s;e-water, with a little nitre di&s;&s;olved in it, will greatly refre&s;h the patient. This ought to be done fre|quently, e&s;pecially if the weather be hot.</P>
<P>THE patient's mouth &s;hould be often wa&s;hed with warm water, mixed with honey, and a little vinegar; or a de|coction of figs in barley-water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> His feet and hands ought likewi&s;e frequently to be bathed in lukewarm water; e&s;pecially if the head be effected.</P>
<P>THE patient &s;hould be kept as quiet and ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible. Company, noi&s;e, and every thing that di&s;turbs the mind is hurtful. Even too much light, or any thing that affects the &s;en&s;es, is to be avoided. His attendants &s;hould be as few as po&s;&s;ible, and they ought not to be too often changed. His inclinations ought rather to be &s;oothed than contradicted; even the promi&s;e of what he craves will often &s;atisfy him as much as its reality.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;In this and all other fevers ari&s;ing from too great a quantity, and too rapid a motion of the blood, bleeding is of the greate&s;t importance. This opera|tion ought always to be performed as &s;oon as the &s;ymptoms of an inflammatory fever appear. The quantity of blood to be let mu&s;t be in proportion to the &s;trength of the pa|tient, and the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e. If after the fir&s;t bleed|ing the fever &s;eems to ri&s;e, and the pul&s;e feels hard, there will be a nece&s;&s;ity for repeating it a &s;econd, and perhaps a third time, which may be done at the di&s;tance of twelve, eighteen, or twenty-four hours, as the &s;ymptoms require. If the pul&s;e continues &s;oft, and the patient is tolerably ea&s;y after the fir&s;t bleeding, it ought not to be repeated till ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE cooling febrifuge draught, recommended in the in|termitting fever, page 105, will likewi&s;e be very proper here; only the brandy mu&s;t be left out, and half a dram of purified nitre added in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>IF the above cannot be conveniently obtained, forty or fifty drops of the dulcified or &s;weet &s;pirit of vitriol may be made into a draught, with an ounce of ro&s;e-water, two ounces of common water, and half an ounce of &s;imple &s;y|rup, or a bit of loaf-&s;ugar. This draught may be given to
<PB N="112" REF="012338_0116_0F88E9C72B25F5A0">
the patient every three hours while the fever is violent; af|terwards, once in five or &s;ix hours will be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>IF the patient be afflicted with reaching or an inclination to vomit, it will be right to a&s;&s;i&s;t nature's attempts, by giving him weak camomile tea or lukewarm water to drink.</P>
<P>IF the belly be bound, the patient ought daily to receive a cly&s;ter of milk and water with a little &s;alt, and a &s;poonful of &s;weet oil or fre&s;h butter. If this has not the de&s;ired effect, a tea-&s;poonful of magne&s;ia alba, or cream of tartar, may be frequently put into his drink. He may likewi&s;e eat tama|rinds, boiled prunes, roa&s;ted apples, and the like.</P>
<P>IF about the 10th, 11th, or 12th day, the pul&s;e becomes more &s;oft, the tongue moi&s;ter, and the urine begins to let fall a reddi&s;h &s;ediment, there is rea&s;on to expect a favourable i&s;&s;ue to the di&s;ea&s;e. But if, in&s;tead of tho&s;e &s;ymptoms, the patient's &s;pirits grow languid, his pul&s;e &s;inks, and his breath|ing becomes difficult; with a &s;tupor, tremors of the nerves, &s;tarting of the tendons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there is rea&s;on to fear that the con&s;equences will be fatal. In this ca&s;e, bli&s;tering plai&s;ters mu&s;t be applied to the head, ancles, in&s;ide of the thighs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the patient mu&s;t be &s;upported with cordials, as &s;trong wine-whey, negas, &s;ago-gruel, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>A proper regimen is not only nece&s;&s;ary during the fever, but likewi&s;e after the patient begins to recover. By ne|glecting that, many relap&s;e, or fall into other di&s;ea&s;es, and continue valetudinary for life, Tho' the body be weak after a fever, yet the food for &s;ome time ought to be rather clean&s;ing than of too nouri&s;hing a nature. The per&s;on &s;hould take great care not to exceed in any thing. Too much food, drink, &s;leep, exerci&s;e, company, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are care|fully to be avoided. The mind ought likewi&s;e to be kept ea&s;y, and the per&s;on &s;hould not attempt to pur&s;ue &s;tudy, or any thing that requires inten&s;e thinking.</P>
<P>IF the dige&s;tion be bad, or the per&s;on b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> troubled at times with feveri&s;h heats, an infu&s;ion of the Je&s;uits bark in cold water will be o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> u&s;e. It will &s;trengthen the &s;tomach, and help to &s;ubdue the remains of the fever.</P>
<P>WHEN the patient's &s;trength is pretty well recovered, he ought to take &s;ome gentle laxative. An ounce of tamarinds and a dram of &s;enna, may be boiled for a few minutes in an Engli&s;h pint of water, and an ounce of manna di&s;&s;olved in the decoction; afterwards, it may be &s;trained, and a tea|cupful drank every hour till it operates. This do&s;e may be
<PB N="113" REF="012338_0117_0F88E9C902EA9118">
repeated twice or thrice, five or &s;ix days intervening be|twixt each do&s;e.</P>
<P>THOSE who follow laborious employments ought not to return too &s;oon to their labour after a fever, but &s;hould keep ea&s;y till their &s;trength and &s;pirits be recruited.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE PLEURISY.</HEAD>
<P>THE true pleuri&s;y is an inflammation of that membrane, called the <HI>pleura,</HI> which lines the in&s;ide of the brea&s;t. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed into the moi&s;t and the dry. In the former, the patient &s;pits freely; but in the latter, little or none at all. There is likewi&s;e a &s;pecies of this di&s;ea&s;e, which is called the <HI>&s;purious</HI> or <HI>ba&s;tard pleuri&s;y,</HI> in which the pain is more exter|nal, and chiefly affects the mu&s;cles between the ribs. This di&s;ea&s;e abounds among labouring people, e&s;pecially &s;uch as work without doors, and are of a &s;anguine con&s;titution. It is mo&s;t frequent in the &s;pring-&s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;The pleuri&s;y is occa&s;ioned by whatever ob&s;tructs the per&s;piration; as cold northerly winds, drinking cold liquors when the body is hot, &s;leeping without doors on the damp ground, wet cloaths, plunging the body into cold water, or expo&s;ing it to the cold air when covered with &s;weat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It may likewi&s;e be occa&s;ioned by drinking &s;trong liquors; by the &s;toppage of u&s;ual evacuations, as old ulcers, i&s;&s;ues, &s;weating of the feet or hands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the &s;udden &s;triking in of any eruption, as the itch, the mea&s;les, or the &s;mall-pox. Tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to bleed at a certain &s;ea|&s;on of the year, are apt, if they neglect it, to be &s;eized with a pleuri&s;y. Keeping the body too warm by means of fire, cloaths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> renders it more liable to this di&s;ea&s;e. A pleu|ri&s;y may likewi&s;e be occa&s;ioned by violent exerci&s;e, as run|ning, wre&s;tling, leaping, or by &s;upporting great weights, e&s;pecially on the brea&s;t. The very make of the body &s;ome|times predi&s;po&s;es per&s;ons to this di&s;ea&s;e, as a narrow che&s;t, a &s;traitne&s;s of the arteries of the pleura, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;This, like mo&s;t other fevers, be|gins with chillne&s;s and &s;hivering, which are followed by heat, thir&s;t, and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s. To the&s;e &s;ucceed a violent pricking pain in one of the &s;ides among&s;t the ribs. Some|times the pain extends towards the backbone, &s;ometimes to|wards the forepart of the brea&s;t, and at other times towards the &s;houlder-blades. The pain is generally mo&s;t violent when the patient draws in his breath.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="012338_0118_0F88E9C981553F60">
THE pul&s;e in this di&s;ea&s;e is generally hard, the urine high coloured; and if blood be let, it is covered with a tough cru&s;t, or buffy coat. The patient's &s;pittle is at fir&s;t thin, but afterwards it becomes gro&s;&s;er, and is often &s;treaked with blood</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;Nature endeavours to carry off this di&s;ea&s;e either by a critical di&s;charge of blood from the no&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or by expectoration, &s;weat, loo&s;e &s;tools, thick urine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When the violence of the fever is not broken by the&s;e, or other evacuations, it often ends in an ab&s;ce&s;s o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uppuration; to which en&s;ues an ulcer, mortification, and death.</P>
<P>THE violence of this di&s;ea&s;e may generally be checked by le&s;&s;ening the force of the circulation, relaxing the ve&s;|&s;els, diluting the humours, and promoting expectoration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>FOR the&s;e purpo&s;es, the diet, as in the former di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t be cool, &s;lender, and diluting. The patient mu&s;t avoid food that is vi&s;cid, hard of dige&s;tion, or that affords much nouri&s;hment, as fle&s;h, butter, chee&s;e, eggs, milk, and al&s;o every thing that is of a heating nature. His drink mu&s;t be &s;weet whey, or decoctions and infu&s;ions of the pectoral and bal&s;amic vegetables.</P>
<P>TAKE a table &s;poonful of lin&s;eed, a quarter of an ounce of liquorice-root &s;liced, and half an ounce of the leaves of coltsfoot. Put the&s;e ingredients in a clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el, pour on them a quart of boiling water, and let them &s;tand near a fire for eight or ten hours; afterwards &s;train off the liquor; of which the patient may take a cupful frequently for his ordinary drink.</P>
<P>BARLEY-WATER &s;weetened with honey, or &s;harpened with the jelly of currants, is likewi&s;e a very proper drink in this di&s;ea&s;e. It is made by boiling an ounce of pearl-barley in three Engli&s;h pints of water to two, which mu&s;t afterwards be &s;trained. The decoction of figs, rai&s;ins, and barley, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> recommended in the continual fever, p. 110. is here likewi&s;e very proper. The&s;e, and other diluting li|quors, are not to be drank in large quantities at a time; but the patient ought, in a manner, keep continually &s;ip|ping them, &s;o as to render his mouth and throat always moi&s;t. All his food and drink mu&s;t be taken a little warm.</P>
<P>THE patient &s;hould be kept quiet, cool, and every way ea|&s;y, as directed under the foregoing di&s;ea&s;e. His feet and hands
<PB N="115" REF="012338_0119_0F88E9CA2C7A0838">
ought daily to be bathed in warm water; and he may &s;ometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it up in bed for a &s;hort &s;pace, in order to re|lieve his head.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;Almo&s;t every per&s;on knows when a fever is attended with a violent pain of the &s;ide, and a quick, hard pul&s;e, that bleeding is nece&s;&s;ary. When the&s;e &s;ymptoms appear, the &s;ooner this operation is per|formed the better; and the quantity at fir&s;t mu&s;t be pretty large, provided the patient be able to bear it. A large quantity of blood let at once, in the beginning of a pleuri|&s;y, has a much greater effect than &s;everal repeated &s;mall bleedings. An adult per&s;on may lo&s;e ten or twelve ounces of blood as &s;oon as it is certainly known that he is &s;eized with a pleuri&s;y. For a younger per&s;on, or one of a delicate con|&s;titution, the quantity mu&s;t be le&s;s.</P>
<P>IF after the fir&s;t bleeding, the &s;titch, with the other vio|lent &s;ymptoms, &s;hould continue, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, at the di&s;tance of twelve or eighteen hours, to let eight or nine ounces more. If the &s;ymptoms do not then abate, and the blood &s;hows a &s;trong buffy coat, a third or even a fourth bleeding may be requi&s;ite. If the pain of the &s;ide abates, the pul&s;e becomes &s;ofter, or the patient begins to &s;pit free|ly of a brown or reddi&s;h colour, bleeding ought not to be repeated. This operation is &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary after the third or fourth day of the fever, and ought not then to be performed without the advice of a phy&s;ician, unle&s;s in the mo&s;t urgent circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE blood may be many ways attenuated without let|ting it off. There are likewi&s;e many things that may be done to ea&s;e the pain of the &s;ide be&s;ides bleeding. Thus, after the fir&s;t or &s;econd bleeding, emollient fomentations may be applied to the part affected. The&s;e may be made by boiling a handful of the flowers of elder, camomile, and common mallows, or any other &s;oft vegetables, in a proper quantity of water. The herbs may be either put into a bag, and applied warm to the &s;ide, or flannels may be dip|ped in the decoction, afterwards wrung out, and applied to the part affected, with as much warmth as the patient can ea&s;ily bear. As the cloths grow cool, they mu&s;t be chan|ged, and great care taken that the patient do not catch cold: An ox's bladder may be half filled with warm milk and wa|ter, and applied to to the &s;ide, if the above method of fo|menting be found inconvenient. Fomentations not only
<PB N="116" REF="012338_0120_0F88E9CAF7F40D08">
ea&s;e the pain, but by relaxing the ve&s;&s;els, prevent the &s;tag|nation of the blood and other humours.</P>
<P>THE &s;ide may likewi&s;e be frequently rubbed with a little of the following liniment. Take two table &s;poonfuls of the oil of &s;weet almonds, olives, or any other &s;weet oil, and two tea &s;poonfuls of &s;pirit of hart&s;horn: Shake them well together, and rub about a tea &s;poonful upon the &s;ide, with a warm hand, three or four times a-day.</P>
<P>SOME recommend dry applications to the affected &s;ide, as burnt oats, toa&s;ted bread, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the&s;e, though they may be u&s;eful, are not &s;o proper as moi&s;t ones. Could it be properly conducted, we would recommend putting the patient into a bath of warm milk and water, in which emol|lient vegetables had been boiled; but as this cannot always be obtained, we &s;hall recommend what is in every per&s;on's power, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to apply &s;oft poultices, or catapla&s;ms to the part affected. The&s;e may be made of wheat bread and milk, &s;oftened with oil or fre&s;h butter.</P>
<P>LEAVES of various plants might likewi&s;e be applied to the patient's &s;ide with advantage. We have often &s;een, and even felt, the benefit of young cabbage leaves applied warm to the &s;ide in a pleuri&s;y. The&s;e not only relax, but likewi&s;e draw off a little moi&s;ture, and may prevent the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of bli&s;tering plai&s;ters; which, however, when other things fail, mu&s;t be applied.</P>
<P>IF the &s;titch continues after repeated bleedings, fomenta|tions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a bli&s;tering plai&s;ter mu&s;t be laid upon the part affected, and &s;uffered to remain for two days. This not only procures a di&s;charge from the &s;ide, but actually thins the blood, and by that means a&s;&s;i&s;ts in removing the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>TO prevent a &s;tranguary when the bli&s;tering plai&s;ter is on, the patient may drink freely of the following emul&s;ion: take an ounce of &s;weet almonds blanched, and beat them well in a mortar, with an equal quantity of fine &s;ugar; then di&s;&s;olve half an ounce of gum arabic in an Engli&s;h quart of barley water warm. Let it &s;tand till cool, and afterwards pour it by little and little upon the almonds and &s;ugar, continually rubbing them till the liquor becomes uniformly white or milky. Afterwards &s;train it, and let the patient u&s;e it for ordinary drink. A quart bottle, at lea&s;t, may be drank daily.</P>
<P>IF the patient be co&s;tive, a cly&s;ter of warm water, or of barley water, in which a handful of mallows, or any
<PB N="117" REF="012338_0121_0F88E9CBE9B40680">
other emollient vegetable, has been boiled, may be daily admini&s;tered. This will not only empty the bowels, but have the effect of a warm fomentation applied to the infe|rior vi&s;cera, which will help to make a derivation from the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>THE expectoration, or &s;pitting, may be promoted by &s;harp, oily, and mucilaginous medicines. For this purpo&s;e, an ounce of the oxymel or vinegar of &s;quills may be added to &s;ix ounces of the pectoral decoction, and two table &s;poonfuls of it taken every two hours.</P>
<P>SHOULD the &s;quill di&s;agree with the &s;tomach, two oun|ces of the oil of &s;weet almonds, or oil of olives, and two ounces of the &s;yrup of violets, may be mixed with as much &s;ugar-candy powdered as will make an electuary of the con|&s;i&s;tence of honey. The patient may take a little of this frequently, when the cough is trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>SHOULD oily medicines happen to prove nau&s;eous, which is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, two drams of gum ammoniac may be di&s;&s;olved in half an Engli&s;h pint of barley water, in the following manner: The gum mu&s;t be well rubbed in a mortar, and the water gradually poured upon it till it be quite di&s;&s;olved. Three or four ounces of &s;imple pennyroy|al water may be added to the above quantity, and two table &s;poonfuls of it taken three or four times a-day.</P>
<P>IF the patient does not per&s;pire, but has a burning heat upon his &s;kin; and pa&s;&s;es very little water, &s;ome &s;mall do|&s;es of purified nitre and camphire will be of u&s;e. Two drams of the former may be rubbed with five or &s;ix grains of the latter in a mortar, and the whole divided into &s;ix do|&s;es, one of which may be taken every five or &s;ix hours, in a little of the patient's ordinary drink.</P>
<P>BUT the be&s;t medicine, which &s;ome indeed reckon al|mo&s;t a &s;pecific in the pleuri&s;y, is the decoction of the Sene|ca rattle&s;nake root. Two ounces of the root, gro&s;sly pow|dered, mu&s;t be boiled in two Engli&s;h pints and an half of water, till one half the water be con&s;umed. It mu&s;t not be boiled quickly, but gradually &s;immered over a &s;low fire. After bleeding, and other evacuations have been premi&s;ed, the patient may take two, three, or four table &s;poonfuls of this decoction, according as his &s;tomach will bear it, three or four times a-day. If it &s;hould occa&s;ion vomiting, two or three ounces of &s;imple cinnamon water, may be mixed with the quantity of decoction above mentioned, or it may be taken in &s;maller do&s;es. As this medicine at once pro|motes

per&s;piration, urine, and keeps the belly ea&s;y, it bids the faire&s;t of any thing yet known to an&s;wer all the in|tentions of cure in a pleuri&s;y, or any other inflammation of the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>NO one will imagine, that the&s;e medicines are all to be u&s;ed at the &s;ame time. We have mentioned different things, on purpo&s;e that people may have it in their power to choo&s;e; and, likewi&s;e, that when one thing cannot be obtained, they may make u&s;e of another. Different medicines are no doubt nece&s;&s;ary in the different periods of a di&s;or|der; and where one fails of &s;ucce&s;s, or di&s;agrees with the patient, it will be proper to try another.</P>
<P>WHAT is called the cri&s;is, or height of the fever, is &s;ometimes attended with very alarming &s;ymptoms; as diffi|culty of breathing, an irregular pul&s;e, convul&s;ive motions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e are apt to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight the attendants, and induce them to do improper things, as bleeding the patient, giving him &s;trong &s;timulating medicines, or the like. But they are only the &s;truggles of nature to overcome the di&s;ea&s;e, in which &s;he ought to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by plenty of diluting drink, which is then peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary, as the febrile matter is now ready to be di&s;charged. If the patient's &s;trength, however, be much exhau&s;ted by the di&s;ea&s;e, it may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, at this time, to &s;upport him with frequent &s;mall draughts of wine whey, or the like.</P>
<P>WHEN the pain and fever are gone, it will be proper, after the patient has gathered &s;ufficient &s;trength, to give him &s;ome gentle purges, as tho&s;e directed under the acute, continual fever, page 112. He ought likewi&s;e to u&s;e a light diet, of ea&s;y dige&s;tion; and, his drink &s;hould be butter-milk, whey, and other things of a clean&s;ing na|ture.</P>
<P>THAT &s;pecies of pleuri&s;y, which is called the <HI>ba&s;tard,</HI> or <HI>&s;purious,</HI> generally goes off by keeping warm for a few days, drinking plenty of diluting liquors, and ob&s;erving a proper regimen.</P>
<P>IT is known by a dry cough, a quick pul&s;e, and a dif|ficulty of lying on the affected &s;ide, which la&s;t does not always happen in the true pleuri&s;y. Sometimes, indeed, this di&s;ea&s;e proves ob&s;tinate, and requires bleeding, with cupping, and &s;carifications of the affected &s;ide. The&s;e, together with the u&s;e of nitrous, and other cooling medi|cines, &s;eldom fail to effect a cure.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="012338_0123_0F88E9CFF40AE040">
THE <HI>paraphrenitis,</HI> or inflammation of the diaphragm, is &s;o nearly connected with the pleuri&s;y, and re&s;embles it &s;o much in the manner of treatment, that it is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider it as a &s;eparate di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is attended with a very acute fever, and an extreme pain of the part affected, which is generally augmented by coughing, &s;neezing, drawing in the breath, taking food, going to &s;tool, making water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence the patient breathes quick, and draws in his bowels to prevent the mo|tion of the diaphragm, is re&s;tle&s;s, anxious, has a dry cough, a hiccup, and often a delirium. A convul&s;ive laugh, or ra|ther a kind of involuntary grin, is no uncommon &s;ymptom of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>EVERY method mu&s;t be taken to prevent a &s;uppuration, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave the patient's life when that hap|pens. The regimen and medicine are in all re&s;pects the &s;ame as in the pleuri&s;y.

<HEAD>OF A PERIPNEUMONY, OR INFLAM|MATION OF THE LUNGS.</HEAD>
<P>AS this di&s;ea&s;e affects an organ which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to life, it mu&s;t always be attended with danger. Tho&s;e who abound with thick blood, who&s;e fibres are ten&s;e and rigid, who &s;eed upon gro&s;s aliment, and drink &s;trong vi&s;cid liquors, are mo&s;t liable to this di&s;ea&s;e. It is generally fatal to per&s;ons of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lat brea&s;t, or narrow che&s;t, and to &s;uch as are afflicted with an a&s;thma, e&s;pecially in the decline of life. Sometimes the inflammation reaches to one lobe of the lungs only, at other times the whole of that organ is affected; in which ca&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e can hardly fail to prove fatal.</P>
<P>WHEN the di&s;ea&s;e proceeds from a vi&s;cid pituitous matter, ob&s;tructing the ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, it is called a <HI>&s;purious</HI> or <HI>ba&s;tard peripneumony.</HI> When it ari&s;es from a thin acrid de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">uction on the lungs, it is denominated a <HI>catarrhal peripneu|mony,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;An inflammation of the lungs is &s;ome|times a primary di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;ometimes it &s;ucceeds to other di&s;ea&s;es, as a quin&s;y, a pleuri&s;y, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It ari&s;es from the &s;ame cau&s;es as pleuri&s;y, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration from
<PB N="120" REF="012338_0124_0F88E9D19DFC7BB0">
cold, wet cloaths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or from an increa&s;ed circulation of the blood by violent exerci&s;e, the u&s;e of &s;piceries, ardent &s;pirits, and &s;uch like. The pleuri&s;y and peripneumony are often complicated; in which ca&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e is called a <HI>pleuro-peripneumony.</HI></P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;Mo&s;t of the &s;ymptoms of a pleu|ri&s;y, likewi&s;e attend an inflammation of the lungs; only in the latter, the pul&s;e is more &s;oft, and the pain le&s;s acute; but the difficulty of breathing, and oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t, are generally greater.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;As the regimen and medicine are in all re&s;pects the &s;ame in the true peripneumony as in the pleuri&s;y, we &s;hall not here repeat them, but refer the reader to the treatment of that di&s;ea&s;e. It may not, however, be improper to add, that the aliment ought to be more &s;lender and thin in this than in any other inflammatory di&s;ea&s;e. The learned Dr. Arbuthnot a&s;&s;erts, that even common whey is &s;ufficient to &s;upport the patient, and that decoctions of barley, and infu&s;ions of fennel-roots in warm water with milk, are the mo&s;t proper both for drink and nouri&s;hment. He likewi&s;e recommends the &s;team of warm water taken in by the breath, which &s;erves as a kind of internal fomenta|tion, and helps to attenuate the impacted humours. If the patient has loo&s;e &s;tools, but is not weakened by them, they are not to be &s;topped, but rather promoted by the u&s;e of emollient cly&s;ters.</P>
<P>IT has already been ob&s;erved, that the <HI>&s;purious</HI> or <HI>ba&s;tard</HI> peripneumony is occa&s;ioned by a vi&s;cid pituitous matter ob|&s;tructing the ve&s;&s;els of the lungs. It commonly attacks the old, infirm, and phlegmatic, in winter or wet &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE patient, at the beginning, is cold and hot by turns, has a &s;mall quick pul&s;e, feels a &s;en&s;e of weight upon his brea&s;t, breathes with difficulty, and &s;ometimes complains of a pain and giddine&s;s of his head. His urine is commonly pale, and his colour very little changed.</P>
<P>THE diet in this, as well as in the true peripneumony, mu&s;t be very &s;lender, as weak broths &s;harpened with the juice of orange or lemon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> His drink may be thin wa|ter-gruel &s;weetened with honey, or a decoction of fennel-root, liquorice, and roots of quick gra&s;s. An ounce of each of tho&s;e may be boiled in three Engli&s;h pints of water to a quart, and &s;harpened with a little cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rant-jelly, or the like.</P>
<P>BLEEDING and purging are generally proper at the be|ginning of this di&s;ea&s;e; but if the patient's &s;pittle be pretty thick, or well concocted, neither of them are nece&s;&s;ary. It
<PB N="121" REF="012338_0125_0F88E9D1B6B59D80">
will be &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;i&s;t the expectoration by &s;ome of the &s;oft bal&s;amic medicines, recommended for that purpo&s;e in the pleuri&s;y. Bli&s;tering plai&s;ters have generally a good ef|fect, and ought to be applied pretty early. They may either be applied to the neck or ancles, or both, if nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IF the patient does not &s;pit, he mu&s;t be bled, if his &s;trength will permit, and have a gentle purge admini&s;tered. Afterwards his belly may be kept open by cly&s;ters, and the expectoration promoted, by taking every four hours two table &s;poonfuls of the &s;olution of gum ammoniac, recom|mended in the pleuri&s;y, page 117.</P>
<P>WHEN an inflammation of the brea&s;t does not yield to bleeding, bli&s;tering, and the other means mentioned above, it commonly ends in a &s;uppuration, which is more or le&s;s dangerous, according to the part where it is &s;ituate. When this happens in the pleura, it &s;ometimes breaks outwardly, and the matter is discharged by the wound.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the &s;uppuration happens within the &s;ub|&s;tance or body of the lungs; in which ca&s;e the matter may be di&s;charged by expectoration; but if the matter floats in the cavity of the brea&s;t, between the pleura and the lungs, it can only be di&s;charged by an inci&s;ion made betwixt the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>IF the patient's &s;trength does not return after the inflam|mation is to all appearance removed; if his pul&s;e continues quick, tho' &s;oft, his breathing difficult and oppre&s;&s;ed; if he has cold &s;hiverings at times, his cheek&punc; flu&s;hed, his lips dry; and if he complains of thir&s;t, and want of appetite; there is rea&s;on to fear that a &s;uppuration is going on, and that a phthi&s;is or con&s;umption of the lungs will en&s;ue. We &s;hall therefore proceed to con&s;ider the proper treatment of that di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF CONSUMPTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>A con&s;umption is a wa&s;ting or decay of the whole body, from an ulcer, tubercles, or concretion of the lungs; from an empyema, a nervous atrophy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>DR. Arbuthnot ob&s;erves, that in his time con&s;umptions made up above one tenth part of the bills of mortality about London. There is rea&s;on to believe, they have rather in|crea&s;ed &s;ince that time; and we know for certain, that they are not le&s;s fatal in &s;everal other towns in England than in London.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="012338_0126_0F88E9D292F4D820">
YOUNG per&s;ons betwixt the age of fifteen and thirty, of a &s;lender make, long neck, high &s;houlders, and flat brea&s;ts, are mo&s;t liable to this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>CONSUMPTIONS prevail more in England than in any other part of the world, owing, perhaps, to the great u&s;e of animal food, and &s;trong liquors, the general application to &s;edentary employments, and the great quantity of pit-coal which is there burnt; to which we may add, the perpetual changes in the atmo&s;phere, or variablene&s;s of the weather.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;It has already been ob&s;erved, that in|flammations of the brea&s;t often end in an impo&s;thume: Con&s;equently, whatever predi&s;po&s;es to tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, mu&s;t likewi&s;e be con&s;idered as a cau&s;e of con&s;umptions.</P>
<P>MANY other di&s;ea&s;es, by vitiating the humours, may likewi&s;e occa&s;ion con&s;umptions; as the &s;curvy, the &s;cro|phula or king's evil, the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, the a&s;thma, &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As this di&s;ea&s;e is &s;eldom cured, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to point out its cau&s;es more particularly, in order that people may be the better enabled to avoid it. The&s;e are:</P>
<P>&mdash;WANT of exerci&s;e. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that this di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o common among&s;t the inhabitants of great towns, who follow &s;edentary employments, and likewi&s;e among&s;t the rich, who are not under the nece&s;&s;ity of la|bouring for their bread.</P>
<P>&mdash;CONFINED or unwhole&s;ome air. Air which &s;tag|nates, or is Impregnated with the fumes of metals or mine|rals, is extremely hurtful to the lungs, and often corrodes the tender ve&s;&s;els of that nece&s;&s;ary organ.</P>
<P>&mdash;VIOLENT pa&s;&s;ions or affections of the mind; as grief, di&s;appointment, anxiety, or clo&s;e application to the &s;tudy of ab&s;tru&s;e arts or &s;ciences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;EXCESSIVE evacuations; as &s;weating, diarrhoeas, diabetes, exce&s;&s;ive venery, the flour albus, an over-di&s;charge of the men&s;trual flux, giving &s;uck too long, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;THE &s;udden &s;toppage of cu&s;tomary evacuations; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the bleeding piles, &s;weating of the feet, bleeding of the no&s;e, the men&s;es, i&s;&s;ues, ulcers, or eruptions of any kind.</P>
<P>&mdash;CHANGING &s;uddenly from a hot to a very cold cli|mate, or whatever greatly le&s;&s;ens the per&s;piration.</P>
<P>&mdash;FREQUENT and exce&s;&s;ive debaucheries. Late watch|ing, and drinking of &s;trong liquors, which generally go to|gether, can hardly fail to de&s;troy the lungs. Hence the <HI>bon companion</HI> generally falls a &s;acrifice to this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="012338_0127_0F88E9D3317EA398">
&mdash;INFECTION. Con&s;umptions are often caught by &s;leeping with the di&s;ea&s;ed; for which rea&s;on this &s;hould be carefully avoided. It cannot be of great benefit to the &s;ick, and mu&s;t hurt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;e in health.</P>
<P>&mdash;OCCUPATIONS in life. Tho&s;e artificers who &s;it much, and are con&s;tantly leaning forward, or pre&s;&s;ing upon their &s;tomachs and brea&s;ts, as cutlers, taylors, &s;hoemakers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> often die of con&s;umptions.</P>
<P>&mdash;COLD. More con&s;umptive patients date their di&s;|orders from wet feet, damp beds, night air, wet cloaths, and &s;uch like, than from all other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>SHARP, &s;aline, and aromatic aliments, which heat and inflame the blood, are likewi&s;e frequently the cau&s;e of con|&s;umptions.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall only add, that this di&s;ea&s;e is often owing to an hereditary taint; in which ca&s;e, it is generally incurable.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;This di&s;ea&s;e generally begins with a dry cough, which often continues for &s;ome months. If a di&s;po&s;ition to vomit after eating be excited by it, there is great rea&s;on to fear an approaching con&s;umption. The patient complains of a more than u&s;ual degree of heat, a pain and oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t, e&s;pecially after motion; his &s;pittle is of a &s;alti&s;h ta&s;te, and &s;ometimes mixed with blood. He is apt to be &s;ad; his appetite is bad, and his thir&s;t great. There is generally a &s;en&s;e of weight on the brea&s;t, with a quick, &s;oft, &s;mall pul&s;e; though &s;ometimes the pul&s;e is pret|ty full, and rather hard. The&s;e are the common &s;ymptoms of a beginning con&s;umption.</P>
<P>AFTERWARDS the patient begins to &s;pit a greeni&s;h, white, or bloody matter. His body is extenuated by the hectic fever and colliquative &s;weats, which mutually &s;ucceed one another, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the one towards the night, and the other in the morning. A loo&s;ene&s;s, and exce&s;&s;ive di&s;charge of urine, are often trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms at this time, and greatly weaken the patient. There is a burning heat in the palms of the hands, and the face generally flu&s;hes after eating; the fingers become remarkably &s;mall, the nails are bent inwards, and the hairs fall off.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t, the &s;welling of the feet and legs, the total lo&s;s of &s;trength, the &s;inking of the eyes, the difficulty of &s;wallow|ing, and the coldne&s;s of the extremities, &s;how the immedi|ate approach of death, which, however, the patient &s;eldom believes to be &s;o near. Such is the u&s;ual progre&s;s of this
<PB N="124" REF="012338_0128_0F88E9D40DEDB838">
fatal di&s;ea&s;e, which, if not early checked, commonly &s;ets all medicine at defiance.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;On the fir&s;t appearance of this di&s;ea&s;e, if the patient lives in a large town, or any place where the air is confined, he ought immediately to quit it, and to make choice of a &s;ituation in the country, where the air is pure, dry and free. Here he mu&s;t not remain inac|tive, but take every day as much exerci&s;e as he can bear.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t method of taking exerci&s;e is to ride on hor&s;e|back, as this gives the body a great deal of motion without much fatigue. Such as cannot bear this kind of exerci&s;e, mu&s;t make u&s;e of a machine. A long journey, as it amu&s;es the mind by a continual change of objects, is greatly pre|ferable to riding the &s;ame ground over and over. Care, however, mu&s;t be taken to avoid catching cold from wet cloaths, damp beds, or &s;uch like. At any rate, the patient mu&s;t ride; his life depends upon it; and it is almo&s;t an in|fallible remedy, if begun in time, and duly per&s;i&s;ted in.</P>
<P>IT is pity tho&s;e who attend the &s;ick &s;eldom recommend riding in this di&s;ea&s;e, till the patient is either unable to bear it, or the malady is become incurable. Patients are always apt to trifle with every thing that is in their own power. They cannot &s;ee how one of the common actions of life &s;hould prove a remedy in an ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;e, and therefore they reject it, while they greedily hunt after relief from me|dicine, merely becau&s;e it is unknown.</P>
<P>THOSE who have &s;trength and courage to undertake a pretty long voyage, may expect great advantage from it. This has frequently cured a con&s;umption after the patient was thought to be in the la&s;t &s;tage of that di&s;ea&s;e, and where medicine had proved ineffectual. It is rea&s;onable from hence to conclude, that if a voyage were undertaken in due time, it would &s;eldom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">il to perform a cure.</P>
<P>SUCH as try this method of cure, ought to carry as much fre&s;h provi&s;ions along with them as will &s;erve for the whole time they are at &s;ea. As milk is not to be obtained in this &s;ituation, they ought to live upon fruits and the broth of chickens, or other young animals which can be kept alive on board. It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to add, that &s;uch voyages &s;hould be undertaken, if po&s;&s;ible, in the milde&s;t &s;ea&s;on, and that they ought to be towards a warmer climate.</P>
<P>THOSE who have not courage for a long voyage may travel into a more &s;outhern climate, as the &s;outh of France, Spain, or Portugal; and if they find the air of the&s;e countries
<PB N="125" REF="012338_0129_0F88E9D4B3BE3F10">
agree with them, they &s;hould continue there, at lea&s;t till their health be confirmed.</P>
<P>NEXT to proper air and exerci&s;e, we would recommend a due attention to the diet. The patient mu&s;t eat nothing that is either heating or hard of dige&s;tion, and his drink mu&s;t be of a &s;oft and cooling nature. All the diet mu&s;t be calculat|ed to le&s;&s;en the acrimony of the humours, and abate the rapid motion of the blood. For this purpo&s;e the patient mu&s;t keep &s;trictly to the u&s;e of vegetables and milk. Milk, alone, is of more value in this di&s;ea&s;e, than the whole <HI>ma|teria medica.</HI></P>
<P>ASSES milk is generally reckoned preferable to any other; but it cannot always be obtained; be&s;ides, it is generally taken as a medicine, whereas, to produce any con&s;iderable effects, it ought, in a manner, to make the principal part of the patient's food. It is hardly to be expected, that a gill or two of a&s;&s;es milk, drank in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, &s;hould be able to produce any con&s;iderable change in the humours in a &s;hort time; but when people do not per|ceive its effects &s;oon, they lo&s;e hope, and &s;o leave it off. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that this medicine, however valua|ble, very &s;eldom performs a cure. The rea&s;on is obvious; it is commonly u&s;ed too late, is taken in too &s;mall quanti|ties, and is not duly per&s;i&s;ted in.</P>
<P>I have known very extraordinary effects from a&s;&s;es milk in ob&s;tinate coughs, which threatened a con&s;umption of the lungs; and do verily believe, if u&s;ed at this period, that it would &s;eldom fail; but if it be delayed till an ulcer is formed, which is generally the ca&s;e, how can it be expect|ed to &s;ucceed?</P>
<P>ASSES milk ought to be drank, if po&s;&s;ible, in its natural warmth, and in the quantity of half an Engli&s;h pint at a time. In&s;tead of taking this quantity night and morning only, the patient ought to take it four times, or, at lea&s;t, thrice a-day, and to eat a little light bread along with it, &s;o as to make it a kind of meal.</P>
<P>IF a&s;&s;es milk &s;hould happen to purge the patient, it may be mixed with old con&s;erve of ro&s;es, which is it&s;elf a valu|able medicine in this di&s;ea&s;e. If that cannot be obtained, the powder of crabs claws may be u&s;ed in its &s;tead. A&s;&s;es milk is u&s;ually ordered to be drank warm in bed; but as it generally throws the patient into a &s;weat, when taken in this way, it would be proper to give it after he ri&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="012338_0130_0F88E9D607E491A0">
SOME extraordinary cures in con&s;umptive ca&s;es have been performed by brea&s;t milk. Could this be obtained in &s;ufficient quantity, we would recommend it preferable to any other. It is better if the patient can &s;uck it from the brea&s;t than to drink it afterwards. I knew a man who was reduced to &s;uch a degree of weakne&s;s in a con&s;umption, as not to be able to turn him&s;elf in bed. His wife was that time giving &s;uck, and the child happening to die, he &s;ucked her brea&s;ts, not with a view to reap any advantage from the milk, but to make her ea&s;y. Finding him&s;elf however greatly bene|fited by it, he continued to &s;uck her till perfectly recovered, and is at pre&s;ent a &s;trong and healthy man.</P>
<P>SOME prefer butter-milk to any other, and it certainly is a very valuable medicine, if the &s;tomach be able to bear it. It does not agree with every per&s;on at fir&s;t; and is there|fore often laid a&s;ide without a &s;ufficient trial. It &s;hould at fir&s;t be taken &s;paringly, and the quantity gradually increa&s;|ed, until it comes to be almo&s;t the &s;ole food. I never knew it &s;ucceed, unle&s;s where the patient almo&s;t entirely lived upon it.</P>
<P>COWS milk is mo&s;t readily obtained of any; and tho' it be not &s;o ea&s;ily dige&s;ted as that of a&s;&s;es or mares, it may be rendered lighter, by adding to it an equal quantity of barley water, or allowing it to &s;tand for &s;ome hours, and afterwards taking off the cream. If it &s;hould, notwith|&s;tanding, lie heavy on the &s;tomach, a table &s;poonful of rum or brandy, and a bit of loaf-&s;ugar, may be put into half an Engli&s;h pint.</P>
<P>IT is not to be wondered, that milk &s;hould, for &s;ome time, di&s;agree with a &s;tomach that has not been accu&s;tomed to dige&s;t any thing but fle&s;h and &s;trong liquors, which is the ca&s;e of mo&s;t of tho&s;e who fall into con&s;umptions. We do not, however, advi&s;e tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to animal food and &s;trong liquors, to leave them off all at once. This might be dangerous. It will be nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch to eat a little once a-day of the fle&s;h of &s;ome young animal, or rather to u&s;e the broth made of chickens, veal, lamb, or &s;uch like. They ought likewi&s;e to drink a little wine made into negas, or diluted with twice or thrice its quan|tity of water, and to make it gradually weaker till they can leave it off altogether.</P>
<P>THESE mu&s;t be u&s;ed only as preparatives to a diet con|&s;i&s;ting &s;olely of milk and vegetables, which the &s;ooner the patient can be brought to bear, the better. Rice and milk,
<PB N="127" REF="012338_0131_0F88E9D65A23F888">
or barley and milk boiled, with a little &s;ugar, is very pro|per food. Ripe fruits, roa&s;ted, baked, or boiled, are like|wi&s;e proper; as goo&s;e or currant-berry tarts, apples roa&s;ted, or boiled in milk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The jellies, con&s;erves, and pre|&s;erves. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of ripe &s;ubacid fruits, ought to be eat plenti|fully, as the jelly of currants, con&s;erve of ro&s;es, pre&s;erved plumbs, cherries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WHOLESOME air, proper exerci&s;e, and a diet con&s;i&s;ting &s;olely of the&s;e and other vegetables, with milk, is the only cour&s;e that can be depended on in the beginning of a con|&s;umption. If the patient has &s;trength and &s;ufficient re&s;olu|tion to per&s;i&s;t in this cour&s;e, he will &s;eldom be di&s;appointed of a cure.</P>
<P>IN a populous town in England, where con&s;umptions are very common, I have frequently &s;een con&s;umptive pa|tients, who had been &s;ent to the country with orders to ride, and live upon milk and vegetables, return in a few months quite plump, and free of any complaint. This, in|deed, was not always the ca&s;e, e&s;pecially when the di&s;ea&s;e was hereditary, or far advanced; but it was the only me|thod in which &s;ucce&s;s was to be expected; where it failed, I never knew medicine &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>IF the patient's &s;trength and &s;pirits flag, he mu&s;t be &s;up|ported by rich broths, jellies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some recommend &s;hell-fi&s;h in this di&s;order, and we are inclined to think with rea&s;on; they are very nouri&s;hing, at the &s;ame time that they cool the blood, and blunt the acrimony of the hu|mours. All the food and drink ought to be taken in &s;mall quantities, le&s;t an overcharge of fre&s;h chyle &s;hould oppre&s;s the lungs, and too much accelerate the circulation of the blood.</P>
<P>THE patient's mind ought to be kept as ea&s;y and chear|ful as po&s;&s;ible. Con&s;umptions are often occa&s;ioned by a melancholy ca&s;t of mind; for which rea&s;on, mu&s;ic, cheer|ful company, and every thing that in&s;pires mirth, are high|ly beneficial. The patient ought &s;eldom to be left alone, as brooding over his calamities is &s;ure to render them wor&s;e.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;Though we know no medi|cine that will cure a confirmed con&s;umption; yet the fol|lowing things may be of &s;ervice, in abating &s;ome of the more violent &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t &s;tage of a con&s;umption, the cough may &s;ome|times be appea&s;ed by bleeding; and expectoration promoted
<PB N="128" REF="012338_0132_0F88E9D7F16A8728">
by the following medicines. Take fre&s;h &s;quills, gum am|moniac, and powdered cardamum &s;eeds, of each a quarter of an ounce; beat them together in a mortar, and if the ma&s;s proves too hard for pills, a little of any kind of &s;yrup may be added to it. This may be formed into pills of a moderate &s;ize, and four or five of them taken twice or thrice a-day, according as the patient's &s;tomach will bear them.</P>
<P>THE lac ammoniacum, or milk of gum ammoniac, as it is called, is likewi&s;e a proper medicine in this &s;tage of the di&s;|ea&s;e. It may be prepared and u&s;ed, as directed page 117.</P>
<P>A &s;yrup made of equal parts of lemon juice, fine honey, and &s;ugar-candy, may likewi&s;e be u&s;ed. Four ounces of each of the&s;e may be &s;immered together in a &s;auce-pan, over a &s;low fire, and a table &s;poonful of it taken at any time when the cough is trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>IT is common, in this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, to load the patient's &s;tomach with bal&s;amic medicines, and at the &s;ame time, to drench him with decoctions, infu&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the pectoral vegetables. The former of the&s;e, in&s;tead of re|moving the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, tend rather to increa&s;e it, by heating the blood, while the latter pall the appetite, relax the &s;olids, and prove every way hurtful to the pati|ent. Whatever is u&s;ed for removing the cough, be&s;ides, riding, and other proper regimen, ought to be medicines of a &s;harp and clean&s;ing nature.</P>
<P>FOR the patient's drink, we would recommend infu&s;ions of the bitter plants, as ground-ivy, the le&s;&s;er centaury, camomile flowers, or water trefoil. The&s;e infu&s;ions may be drank at plea&s;ure. They &s;trengthen the &s;tomach, pro|mote dige&s;tion, rectify the blood, and at the &s;ame time an|&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of dilution, and quench thir&s;t much better than things that are lu&s;cious or &s;weet.</P>
<P>BUT if the patient &s;pits blood, he ought to u&s;e the fol|lowing decoction for his ordinary drink. Take an ounce of comfrey root, of liquorice and mar&s;h-mallow roots, each half an ounce. Boil them in two Engli&s;h quarts of water to one. If a tea &s;poonful of the acid elixir of vitriol be add|ed to this decoction, when cold, it will be a very proper medicine. A tea cupful of it may be taken at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THERE are many other mucilaginous plants and &s;eeds, of a healing and agglutinating nature, from which decocti|ons or infu&s;ions may be prepared with the &s;ame intention; as the orches, the quince &s;eed, coltsfoot, lin&s;eed, &s;ar&s;aparilla, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is not nece&s;&s;ary to mention the different forms in
<PB N="129" REF="012338_0133_0F88E9D86E11CED8">
which the&s;e may be u&s;ed. Simple infu&s;ion, or boiling, is all that is nece&s;&s;ary, and the do&s;e may be at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>THE con&s;erve of ro&s;es is here peculiarly proper. It may either be put into the decoction above pre&s;cribed, or eat by it&s;elf. No benefit is to be expected from trifling do&s;es of this medicine. I never knew it of any &s;ervice, unle&s;s where three or four ounces at lea&s;t were u&s;ed daily. In this way I have &s;een it produce very extraordinary effects, and would recommend it wherever there is a di&s;charge of blood from the lungs.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;pitting up of gro&s;s matter, oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t, and the hectic &s;ymptoms &s;how that an impo&s;thume is formed in the lungs, we would recommend the Je&s;uits bark, that being the only drug which has any chance to counteract the tendency which the humours then have to putrefaction.</P>
<P>AN ounce of the bark, in powder, may be divided into eighteen or twenty do&s;es, of which one may be taken every three hours through the day, in a little &s;yrup, or a cup of the patient's ordinary drink.</P>
<P>IF the bark &s;hould happen to purge, it may be made into an electuary, with the con&s;erve of ro&s;es: thus; take old con&s;erve of ro&s;es, a quarter of a pound; Je&s;uits bark, in powder, an ounce; &s;yrup of orange, or lemon, as much as will make it of the con&s;i&s;tence of honey. This quanti|ty will &s;erve the patient four or five days, and may be re|peated as there is occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>SUCH as cannot take the bark in &s;ub&s;tance, may infu&s;e it in cold water. This &s;eems to be the be&s;t medium for ex|tracting the virtues of that drug. Half an ounce of bark, in powder, may be infu&s;ed for twenty-four hours in half an Engli&s;h pint of water. Afterwards let it be pa&s;&s;ed through a fine &s;trainer, and an ordinary tea cupful of it taken three or four times a-day.</P>
<P>WE would not recommend the bark while there are any &s;ymptoms of an inflammation of the brea&s;t; but when it is certainly known, that matter is collecting there, it is the only medicine upon which any &s;tre&s;s can be laid. Few pa|tients have re&s;olution enough to give the bark a fair trial, at this period of the di&s;ea&s;e; otherwi&s;e, we have rea&s;on to believe, that great benefit might be reaped from it.</P>
<P>WHEN it is evident, that there is an impo&s;thume in the brea&s;t, and the matter can neither be &s;pit up, nor carried off by ab&s;orption, the patient mu&s;t endeavour to make it
<PB N="130" REF="012338_0134_0F88E9DABB992038">
break inwardly, by drawing in the &s;teams of warm water or vinegar with his breath, coughing, laughing, or bawl|ing aloud, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When it happens to bur&s;t within the lungs, the matter may be di&s;charged by the mouth. Sometimes, indeed, the bur&s;ting of the vomica, occa&s;ions immediate death, by &s;uffocating the patient. When the quantity of matter is great, and the patient's &s;trength exhau&s;ted, this is apt to happen. At any rate, the patient is ready to fall into a &s;woon, and &s;hould have volatile &s;pirits, or &s;alts, held to the no&s;e.</P>
<P>IF the matter di&s;charged be thick, and the cough, and breathing, become ea&s;ier, there may be &s;ome hopes of a cure. The diet, at this time, ought to be light, but re|&s;torative; as, &s;mall chicken broths, &s;ago gruel, rice-milk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The drink, butter-milk, or whey, &s;weetened with honey. This is likewi&s;e a proper time for u&s;ing the Je&s;uits bark, which may be taken as before directed.</P>
<P>IF the vomica, or impo&s;thume, &s;hould di&s;charge it&s;elf into the cavity of the brea&s;t, betwixt the pleura and the lungs, there is no way of getting the matter out, but by an inci&s;ion, as has already been ob&s;erved. As this opera|tion mu&s;t always be performed by a &s;urgeon, it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary for us to de&s;cribe it. We &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that it is not &s;o dreadful as people are apt to imagine, and that it is the only chance the patient has for his life. It is, indeed, a pity that this operation, like mo&s;t others, is ge|nerally delayed till too late. When the whole ma&s;s of hu|mours is tainted, the body wa&s;ted, and the &s;trength decay|ed, it is in vain to attempt to &s;ave the patient's life by an operation.</P>
<P>A NERVOUS CONSUMPTION, is a wa&s;ting, or decay of the whole body, without any con&s;i|derable degree of a fever, cough, or difficulty of breathing. It is attended with indige&s;tion, weakne&s;s, and want of ap|petite <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THOSE who are of a fretful temper, who indulge in &s;pi|rituous liquors, or who breathe an unwhole&s;ome air, are mo&s;t liable to this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>WE would chiefly recommend, for the cure of a ner|vous con&s;umption, a light and nouri&s;hing diet; enough of exerci&s;e, in a free open air; and the u&s;e of &s;uch bitters, as brace and &s;trengthen the &s;tomach; as, the Je&s;uits bark,
<PB N="131" REF="012338_0135_0F88E9DB77AB82B8">
gentian root, camomile, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e may be infu&s;ed in wine, and a gla&s;s of it drank frequently.</P>
<P>IT will greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t the dige&s;tion, and promote the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e, to take, twice a-day, twenty or thirty drops of the elixir of vitriol in a gla&s;s of wine or water.</P>
<P>THE chalybeate wine is likewi&s;e an excellent medicine in this ca&s;e. It &s;trengthens the &s;olids, and powerfully a&s;|&s;i&s;ts nature in the preparation of good blood. It is made by putting three ounces of the filings of &s;teel, or iron, into a bottle of Rheni&s;h wine, and allowing it to dige&s;t for three weeks, frequently &s;haking the bottle. Afterwards the wine mu&s;t be filtered for u&s;e. A table &s;poonful of it may be taken twice or thrice a-day.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE amu&s;ements, cheerful company, and riding about, are, however, preferable to all medicines in this di&s;|ea&s;e. For this rea&s;on, when the patient can afford it, we would recommend a long journey of plea&s;ure, as the mo&s;t likely means to re&s;tore his health.</P>
<P>WHAT is called a <HI>&s;ymptomatic con&s;umption</HI> cannot be cured without fir&s;t removing the di&s;ea&s;e by which it is oc|ca&s;ioned. Thus, when a con&s;umption proceeds from the &s;crophula, or king's evil, from the &s;curvy, the a&s;thma, the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a due attention mu&s;t be paid to the malady from whence it ari&s;es, and the regimen and medicine directed accordingly.</P>
<P>WHEN exce&s;&s;ive evacuations, of any kind, occa&s;ion a con&s;umption, they mu&s;t not only be re&s;trained; but the pa|tient's &s;trength mu&s;t be re&s;tored by gentle exerci&s;e, nou|ri&s;hing diet, and generous cordials, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Young and de|licate mothers, often fall into con&s;umptions, by giving &s;uck too long. As &s;oon as they perceive their &s;trength and ap|petite begin to fail, they ought immediately to wean the child, or give it to another nur&s;e, otherwi&s;e they cannot ex|pect a cure.</P>
<P>BEFORE quitting this &s;ubject, we would earne&s;tly recom|mend it to all who wi&s;h to avoid con&s;umptions, to take as much exerci&s;e without doors as they can; to avoid un|whole&s;ome air, and to &s;tudy &s;obriety. Con&s;umptions owe their pre&s;ent increa&s;e not a little to the fa&s;hionable mode of &s;pending every evening over a punch-bowl, or a bottle of wine. The&s;e liquors not only &s;poil the appetite, and hurt the dige&s;tion, but heat and inflame the blood, and &s;et the whole con&s;titution on fire.</P>

<HEAD>THE SLOW OR NERVOUS FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>NERVOUS fevers have increa&s;ed greatly of late years in this i&s;land, owing, doubtle&s;s, to the increa&s;e of luxury and &s;edentary employments; as this di&s;ea&s;e commonly attacks per&s;ons of a weak relaxed habit, who neglect exerci&s;e, eat little &s;olid food, &s;tudy hard, or indulge in &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;Nervous fevers are occa&s;ioned by what|ever depre&s;&s;es the &s;pirits, or impoveri&s;hes the blood; as grief, fear and anxiety, want of &s;leep, inten&s;e thought; living on poor watery diet, as unripe fruits, cucumbers, melons, mu&s;hrooms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They are likewi&s;e occa&s;ioned by damp, confined, or unwhole&s;ome air. Hence they are very common in rainy &s;ea&s;ons, and prove mo&s;t fatal to tho&s;e who live in dirty, low hou&s;es, crowded &s;treets, ho&s;pitals, jails, or &s;uch like places.</P>
<P>PERSONS who&s;e con&s;titutions have been broken by ex|ce&s;&s;ive venery, frequent &s;alivations, too free an u&s;e of pur|gative medicines, or the like, are very liable to this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>KEEPING on wet cloaths, &s;leeping in the &s;un, lying on the damp ground, exce&s;&s;ive fatigue, and whatever ob&s;tructs the per&s;piration, or cau&s;es a &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture of the &s;o|lids, may likewi&s;e occa&s;ion nervous fevers. We &s;hall only add, frequent and great irregularities in eating and drinking. Too great ab&s;tinence, as well as exce&s;s, is hurtful. Nothing tends &s;o much to pre&s;erve the humours in a &s;ound &s;tate as a regular diet; nor can any thing contribute more to occa|&s;ion fevers of the wor&s;t kind than its contrary.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;Low &s;pirits, want of appetite, weakne&s;s, wearine&s;s after motion, watchfulne&s;s, deep &s;igh|ing, and dejection of mind, are generally the forerunners of this di&s;ea&s;e. The&s;e are &s;ucceeded by a quick low pul&s;e, a dry tongue, without any con&s;iderable thir&s;t, chillne&s;s and flu&s;hing in turns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome time, the patient complains of a giddine&s;s and pain of his head, has a nau&s;ea, with reachings and vo|miting; his pul&s;e is quick, and &s;ometimes intermitting; his urine pale, re&s;embling dead &s;mall bear, and his breath|ing is difficult, with oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t, and &s;light alie|nations of mind.</P>

<P>BUT, if there be an exce&s;&s;ive loo&s;ene&s;s, or wa&s;ting &s;weats, with frequent fainting fits; if the tongue, when put out, trembles exce&s;&s;ively, and the extremities feel cold, with a fluttering or &s;low creeping pul&s;e; if there be a &s;tarting of the tendons, an almo&s;t total lo&s;s of &s;ight and hearing, and an involuntary di&s;charge by &s;tool and urine, there is great rea&s;on to fear that death is approaching.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;It is highly nece&s;&s;ary in this di&s;ea&s;e to keep the patient ea&s;y and quiet. The lea&s;t motion will fatigue him, and will be apt to occa&s;ion wearine&s;s, and even faintings. His mind likewi&s;e ought not only to be kept ea&s;y, but &s;oothed and comforted with the hopes of a &s;peedy recovery. Nothing is more hurtful in low fevers of this kind, than pre&s;enting to the patient's mind gloomy or frightful ideas. The&s;e often occa&s;ion nervous fevers, and it is not to be doubted but they will likewi&s;e increa&s;e the danger.</P>
<P>THE patient mu&s;t not be kept too low. His &s;trength and &s;pirits ought to be &s;upported by nouri&s;hing diet and ge|nerous cordials. For this purpo&s;e, his gruels, panadas, or whatever food he takes, mu&s;t be &s;trengthened with wine, according as the &s;ymptoms may require. Pretty &s;trong wine-whey, or &s;mall negas &s;harpened with the juice of orange or lemon, will be proper for his drink.</P>
<P>WINE, in this di&s;ea&s;e, if it could be obtained genuine, would be almo&s;t the only medicine that we &s;hould need. Good wine po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the virtues of the cordial medicines, while it is free from many of their bad qualities. I &s;ay, good wine; for, however common that article of luxury is now become, it is rarely to be obtained genuine, e&s;pecially by the poor, or &s;uch as purcha&s;e it in &s;mall quantities.</P>
<P>I have &s;een a patient in a low nervous fever, who&s;e pul&s;e could hardly be felt, with a con&s;tant delirium, coldne&s;s of the extremities, and almo&s;t every other mortal &s;ymptom, recover by u&s;ing, in whey, gruel, and negas, a bottle of &s;trong wine every day. Good wine is not only the mo&s;t proper cordial, but &s;eems al&s;o to be an excellent anti&s;pa&s;|modic medicine; and con&s;equently it mu&s;t be highly pro|per in all di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from a poor vapid &s;tate of the blood, and too great a &s;tricture of the &s;olids.</P>
<P>MUSTARD whey is a very proper drink in this fever. It is made by tying in a linen rag a table &s;poonful of common
<PB N="134" REF="012338_0138_0F88E9DE17124000">
mu&s;tard brui&s;ed, and boiling it a little in half an Engli&s;h pint of water, with an equal quantity of milk. Two or three &s;poonfuls of wine may be added to it when boiling, to make the curd &s;eparate more perfectly, and to render the whey more cordial. A tea cupful of this may be given fre|quently for the patient's ordinary drink.</P>
<P>IN a word, the great aim in this di&s;ea&s;e is to &s;upport the patient's &s;pirits, by giving him frequently &s;mall quantities of the above, or other drinks of a warm and cordial nature. He is not, however, to be over-heated either with liquor or cloaths; and his food ought to be light, and given in &s;mall quantities.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;Where a nau&s;ea, load, and &s;ick|ne&s;s at &s;tomach prevail at the beginning of the fever, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give the patient a gentle vomit. Fifteen or twenty grains of ipecacuanha will generally an&s;wer this purpo&s;e very well. This may be repeated any time before the third or fourth day, if the above &s;ymptoms continue. Vomits not only clean the &s;tomach, but, by the general &s;hock which they give, promote the per&s;piration, and have many other excellent effects in &s;low fevers, where there are no &s;igns of inflammation, and nature wants rou&s;ing.</P>
<P>SUCH as dare not venture upon a vomit, may clean the bowels by a &s;mall do&s;e of Turkey rhubarb, or an infu&s;ion of &s;enna and manna.</P>
<P>IN all fevers, the great point is to regulate the &s;ymptoms, &s;o as to prevent their going to either extreme. Thus, in fevers of the inflammatory kind, where the force of the cir|culation is too great, or the blood den&s;e, and the fibres too rigid, bleeding and other evacuations are nece&s;&s;ary. But where nature flags, where the blood is vapid and poor, and and the &s;olids weak and relaxed, there the lancet is to be avoided. Hence, bleeding is never to be permitted in ner|vous fevers unle&s;s there be evident &s;igns of an inflammation, which very &s;eldoms happens.</P>
<P>IT is the more nece&s;&s;ary to caution people again&s;t bleed|ing in this di&s;ea&s;e, as there is generally, at the beginning, an univer&s;al &s;tricture upon the ve&s;&s;els, which even to the pa|tient him&s;elf often gives the idea of a plethora, or too great a quantity of blood. I have known &s;ome of the profe&s;&s;ion deceived by their own feelings in this re&s;pect, &s;o far as to in&s;i&s;t upon being bled, when it was evident that the opera|tion was improper.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="012338_0139_0F88E9DE6B5D1EB8">
I remember to have attended an apothecary in a nervous fever, who, at the beginning, was &s;o fully per&s;uaded of the exi&s;tence of a plethora, and the nece&s;&s;ity of bleeding, that when I objected to it, he told me he was &s;o certain of the nece&s;&s;ity of that operation from his own feelings, that if it was not performed he could not live; and that if no body el&s;e would bleed him, he was determined to do it him&s;elf. He was accordingly bled, but was &s;oon convinced of his error. The blood &s;hewed no &s;igns of inflammation, and he was &s;o remarkably wor&s;e after the operation, that he nar|rowly e&s;caped with his life. His pul&s;e and &s;pirits &s;unk ex|ceedingly, &s;o that he could hardly be &s;upported by a bottle of &s;trong wine in the day, be&s;ides other cordial medicines.</P>
<P>THO' bleeding be improper in this di&s;ea&s;e, yet bli&s;tering is highly nece&s;&s;ary. Bli&s;tering pla&s;ters may be applied at all times of the fever with great advantage; we would, how|ever, advi&s;e people not to make too free with them at the beginning, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t there &s;hould be more occa&s;ion for them after|wards. If the patient be delirious, he ought to be bli&s;tered on the neck, and it will be the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e, while the fever continues; as &s;oon as the di&s;charge occa&s;ioned by one pla&s;ter abates, to apply another &s;ome where el&s;e, and by that means keep up a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of them till the patient be out of danger.</P>
<P>I have been more &s;en&s;ible of the advantage of bli&s;tering in this di&s;ea&s;e, than of any other medicine. It not only pro|motes the circulation by &s;timulating the &s;olids, but likewi&s;e occa&s;ions a continual di&s;charge, which may, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, &s;upply the want of critical evacuations, which &s;eldom happen in this kind of fever.</P>
<P>IF the patient be co&s;tive through the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to procure a &s;tool, by giving him every other day a cly&s;ter of milk and water, with a little &s;ugar, to which may be added a &s;poonful of common &s;alt, if it be ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>SHOULD a violent loo&s;ene&s;s come on, it may be checked, by giving the patient frequently a &s;mall quantity of Venice treacle, or any thing that will promote the per&s;piration.</P>
<P>THO' bli&s;tering and cordial liquors are the only medi|cines to be depended on in this kind of fever, yet, for tho&s;e who may choo&s;e to u&s;e them, we &s;hall mention one or two of the forms of medicine which are commonly pre&s;cribed in it.</P>
<P>THUS, when the patient is low, ten grains of Virginian &s;nakeroot, and the &s;ame quantity of contrayerva root, with
<PB N="136" REF="012338_0140_0F88E9E185018A38">
five grains of Ru&s;&s;ian ca&s;tor, all in fine powder, may be made into a bolus, with a little of the cordial confection or &s;yrup of &s;affron. One of the&s;e may be taken every four or five hours.</P>
<P>THE following powder may be u&s;ed for the &s;ame inten|tion. Take wild Valerian root, in powder, one &s;cruple; &s;affron and ca&s;tor, each four grains. Mix the&s;e by rubbing them together in a mortar, and give it in a cup of wine whey three or four times a-day.</P>
<P>IN de&s;perate ca&s;es, where the hiccup and &s;tarting of the tendons have already come on, we have &s;ometimes &s;een ex|traordinary effects from large do&s;es of mu&s;k frequently ex|hibited. This is doubtle&s;s a great anti&s;pa&s;modic, and may be given to the quantity of a &s;cruple three or four times a-day. Sometimes, it may be proper to add to the mu&s;k a few grains of camphire, and &s;alt of hart&s;horn, as the&s;e tend to promote per&s;piration and urine. Thus, fifteen grains of mu&s;k, with three grains of camphire, and &s;ix grains of &s;alt of hart&s;horn, may be made into a do&s;e and given as above.</P>
<P>IF the fever &s;hould happen to intermit, which it frequent|ly does towards the decline, or if the patient's &s;trength &s;hould be wa&s;ted with colliquative &s;weats, it will be nece&s;&s;a|ry to give him an infu&s;ion of the Je&s;uits bark, with &s;nake|root, in wine or brandy.</P>
<P>HALF an ounce of the bark, with a dram of Virginian &s;nakeroot, half a dram of &s;affron, and half an ounce of orange-peel, all gro&s;sly powdered, may be infu&s;ed in half an Engli&s;h pint of brandy for three or four days. Afterwards &s;train it, and give the patient two tea &s;poonfuls in a gla&s;s of water, or &s;mall wine, three or four times a-day.</P>
<P>SUCH as don't choo&s;e &s;pirits, may infu&s;e the above ingre|dients in a bottle of Li&s;bon wine, and take a gla&s;s of it fre|quently; this will re&s;tore the &s;trength, prevent a relap&s;e, and help to carry off the remains of the fever.</P>
<P>IT will likewi&s;e be proper, at this time, to interpo&s;e now and then a gentle do&s;e of rhubarb, or &s;ome other mild open|ing medicine, taking care, at the &s;ame time, to &s;upport the patient's &s;trength with chicken-broth, jellies, and &s;uch like.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE MALIGNANT, PUTRID, OR SPOTTED FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS may be called the <HI>pe&s;tilential fever</HI> of Europe, as in many of its &s;ymptoms it-bears a great re&s;emblance to that dreadful di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="012338_0141_0F88E9E231CC6DA8">
PERSONS of a lax habit, a melancholy di&s;po&s;ition, and tho&s;e who&s;e vigour has been wa&s;ted by long fa&s;ting, watch|ing, hard labour, exce&s;&s;ive venery, or frequent &s;alivations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are mo&s;t liable to this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;This fever is occa&s;ioned by an un|whole&s;ome, putrid, or &s;tagnating air. Hence it prevails in jails, ho&s;pitals and infirmaries, e&s;pecially where &s;uch places are greatly crowded, and cleanline&s;s is neglected.</P>
<P>A clo&s;e con&s;titution of the air, with long rainy or foggy weather, likewi&s;e occa&s;ions putrid fevers. Hence they often &s;ucceed great inundations in low and mar&s;hy countries, e&s;pe|cially when the&s;e are preceded or followed by a hot and &s;ul|try &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>LIVING too much upon animal food, without a proper mixture of vegetables, or eating fi&s;h or fle&s;h that has been kept too long, are likewi&s;e apt to occa&s;ion this kind of fe|ver. Hence, &s;ailors on long voyages, and the inhabitants of be&s;ieged cities, are very often vi&s;ited with putrid fevers.</P>
<P>CORN that has been greatly damaged by rainy &s;ea&s;ons, or long keeping, and water that has become putrid by &s;tagna|tion, will likewi&s;e occa&s;ion putrid fevers. The exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of alkaline &s;alts will al&s;o have this effect.</P>
<P>DEAD carca&s;es tainting the air, e&s;pecially in hot &s;ea&s;ons, are very apt to occa&s;ion putrid fevers. Hence this kind of fever often prevails in camps, and &s;uch countries as are the &s;cenes of war and blood&s;hed. This &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity of removing church-yards, &s;laughter-hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at a proper di&s;tance from great towns.</P>
<P>WANT of cleanline&s;s is a very general cau&s;e of putrid fe|vers. Hence they prevail among&s;t the poor inhabitants of large towns, who breathe a confined, unwhole&s;ome air, ne|glect cleanline&s;s, and are forced to live upon &s;poiled or un|whole&s;ome provi&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such mechanics as carry on dirty employments, and are con&s;tantly confined within doors, are likewi&s;e very liable to putrid fevers.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall only add, that all putrid, malignant, or &s;potted fevers, are very infectious; and are, therefore, often com|municated in this way. For which rea&s;on, all per&s;ons ought to keep at a di&s;tance from &s;uch as are affected with the&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es, unle&s;s tho&s;e who&s;e attendance is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;The malignant fever is generally preceded by a remarkable weakne&s;s, or lo&s;s of &s;trength, without any apparent cau&s;e. This is &s;ometimes &s;o great,
<PB N="138" REF="012338_0142_0F88E9E2EDD92AD8">
that the patient can &s;carce walk, or even &s;it upright, with|out being in danger of fainting away. His mind too is greatly dejected; he &s;ighs, and is full of dreadful appre|hen&s;ions.</P>
<P>THERE is a nau&s;ea, and &s;ometimes vomiting of bile; a violent pain of the head, with a &s;trong pul&s;ation, or throbbing of the temporal arteries; the eyes often appear red and inflamed, with a pain at the bottom of the orbit; there is a noi&s;e in the ears, the breathing is laborious, and often interrupted with a &s;igh; the patient complains of a pain about the region of the &s;tomach, and in his back and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oins; his tongue is at fir&s;t white, but afterwards it appears black and chapped; and his teeth are covered with a black cru&s;t. He &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;es worms both upwards and downwards, is affected with tremors, or &s;haking, and often becomes delirious.</P>
<P>IF blood be let, it appears di&s;&s;olved, or with a very &s;mall degree of cohe&s;ion, and &s;oon becomes putrid; the &s;tools &s;mell extremely foetid, and are &s;ometimes of a greeni&s;h, black, or reddi&s;h ca&s;t. Spots of a pale, purple, dun, or black colour, often appear upon the &s;kin, and &s;ometimes violent haemorrhages, or di&s;charges of blood from the mouth, eyes, no&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> happen.</P>
<P>PUTRID fevers may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the inflamma|tory, by the &s;mallne&s;s of the pul&s;e, the dejection of mind, the di&s;&s;olved &s;tate of the blood, the petechiae, or purple &s;pots, and the putrid &s;mell of the excrements. They may likewi&s;e be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the low or nervous fever, by the heat and thir&s;t being greater, the urine of a higher co|lour, and the other &s;ymptoms more violent.</P>
<P>IT &s;ometimes, however, happens, that the inflamma|tory, nervous, and putrid &s;ymptoms, are &s;o blended toge|ther, as to render it very difficult to determine to which cla&s;s the fever belongs. In this ca&s;e, the greate&s;t caution and &s;kill are requi&s;ite. All endeavours mu&s;t be u&s;ed to re|lieve the mo&s;t urgent &s;ymptoms; and the efforts of nature are carefully to be watched, in order that we may give her what a&s;&s;i&s;tance we can in expelling the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e in her own way.</P>
<P>INFLAMMATORY and nervous fevers are often converted into malignant and putrid, by too hot a regimen, or im|proper medicines.</P>
<P>THE period of putrid fevers is extremely uncertain; &s;ometimes they terminate betwixt the &s;eventh and fourteenth
<PB N="139" REF="012338_0143_0F88E9E3B1D0A7B0">
day, and at other times, they are prolonged for five or &s;ix weeks. Their duration depends greatly upon the con&s;titution of the patient, and the manner of treating the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t favourable &s;ymptoms are, after the fourth or fifth day, a gentle loo&s;ene&s;s, with a warm, mild &s;weat. The&s;e, when continued for a con&s;iderable time, often carry off the fever, and &s;hould never be imprudently &s;topped. Small miliary pu&s;tules appearing between the petechiae, or purple &s;pots, are likewi&s;e favourable; as al&s;o, hot &s;cabby eruptions about the mouth and no&s;e. It is a good &s;ign when the pul&s;e ri&s;es upon the u&s;e of wine, or other cordi|als, and the nervous &s;ymptoms abate; deafne&s;s coming on towards the decline of the fever, is likewi&s;e a favourable &s;ymptom, and &s;o are ab&s;ce&s;&s;es in the groin, or parotid glands.</P>
<P>AMONGST the unfavourable &s;ymptoms may be reckoned an exce&s;&s;ive loo&s;ene&s;s, with a hard &s;welled belly. Large black or livid blotches breaking out upon the &s;kin, are a proof of the putrid di&s;&s;olution of the blood, and &s;hew the danger to be very great. Aphthae in the mouth, and cold clammy &s;weats&punc; are unfavourable &s;igns; as al&s;o, blindne&s;s, change of the voice, a wild &s;taring of the eyes, difficulty of &s;wallowing, an inability to put out the tongue, and a con&s;tant inclination to uncover the brea&s;t. When the &s;weat and &s;aliva are tinged with blood, and the urine is black, or depo&s;ites a black, &s;ooty &s;ediment, the patient is in great danger. Starting of the tendons, and foetid, ichorous, involuntary &s;tools, attended with coldne&s;s of the extremities, are generally the forerunners of death.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;In the management of this di&s;ea&s;e, we are to endeavour, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to counter|act the putrid tendency of the humours; to &s;upport the pa|tient's &s;trength and &s;pirits; and to a&s;&s;i&s;t nature in expelling the morbific matter, by gently promoting per&s;piration and the other evacuations.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved, that putrid fevers are often occa&s;i|oned by unwhole&s;ome air, and, of cour&s;e, they mu&s;t be aggravated by it. Care mu&s;t, therefore, be taken to prevent the air from &s;tagnating in the patient's chamber, to keep it cool, and renew it frequently, by opening the doors or windows of &s;ome adjacent apartment. The breath and per&s;piration of per&s;ons in perfect health, &s;oon render the air of a &s;mall apartment noxious; but this will &s;ooner
<PB N="140" REF="012338_0144_0F88E9E485E77980">
happen from the per&s;piration and breath of a per&s;on who&s;e whole ma&s;s of humours are in a putrid &s;tate. The&s;e fevers are often &s;o heightened by the &s;ame infected air being breathed over and over, that the patient is, in a manner, &s;uffocated by his own atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>BESIDES the frequent admi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h air, we would recommend the u&s;e of vinegar, verjuice, juice of lemon, Sevil orange, or any kind of vegetable acid that can be mo&s;t rea|dily obtained. The&s;e ought frequently to be &s;prinkled up|on the floor, the bed, and every part of the room. They may al&s;o be evaporated with an hot iron, or by boiling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The fre&s;h &s;kins of lemons or oranges ought likewi&s;e to be laid in different parts of the room, and they &s;hould be fre|quently help to the patient's no&s;e. The u&s;e of acids in this manner would not only prove very refre&s;hing to the patient, but would tend greatly to prevent the infection from &s;preading among tho&s;e who attend him. Strong &s;melled herbs, as rue, tan&s;y, ro&s;emary, wormwood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may likewi&s;e be laid in different parts of the hou&s;e, and &s;melled by tho&s;e who go near the patient.</P>
<P>THE patient mu&s;t not only be kept cool, but likewi&s;e quiet and ea&s;y. The lea&s;t noi&s;e will affect his head, and the &s;malle&s;t fatigue will be apt to make him faint away.</P>
<P>NOTHING is of &s;o great importance in this di&s;ea&s;e, as the liberal u&s;e of acids. The&s;e are to be mixed with all the patient's food, as well as drink. Orange, lemon, or vinegar whey, are all very proper, and may be drank in turns, according to the patient's inclination. The&s;e may be ren|dered cordial, by the addition of wine, in &s;uch quantity as the patient's &s;trength &s;eems to require. When he is very low, he may drink negas, with only one half water, and &s;harpened with the juice of orange or lemon. In &s;ome ca&s;es, a gla&s;s of clear wine may now and then be allowed. The mo&s;t proper wine is Rheni&s;h; but if the belly be open, red Port, or claret, is to be preferred.</P>
<P>WHEN the belly is bound, a tea &s;poonful of the cream of tartar may be put into a cup of the patient's drink, as there is occa&s;ion; or he may eat a few tamrinds, which will both quench his thir&s;t, and keep his belly ea&s;y.</P>
<P>IF camomile tea will &s;it upon the &s;tomach, it is a very proper drink in this di&s;ea&s;e. It may be &s;harpened by add|ing to every cup of the tea fifteen or twenty drops of the elixir of vitriol.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="012338_0145_0F88E9E52BF2DAC0">
THE food mu&s;t be light, as panada, groat-gruel, and &s;uch like; to the&s;e a little wine may be added, if the patient be weak and low, and they ought all to be &s;harpened with the juice of orange, or the jelly of currants, ra&s;pberries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The patient ought likewi&s;e to eat freely of ripe fruits, either baked, roa&s;ted, or raw, as roa&s;ted apples, currant, or goo&s;e|berry tarts, pre&s;erved cherries, plumbs, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>THE patient mu&s;t never be long without nouri&s;hment. Taking a little food or drink frequently, not only &s;upports the &s;pirits, but counteracts the putrid tendency of the hu|mours; for which rea&s;on, he ought con&s;tantly to be &s;ipping &s;mall quantities of &s;ome of the acid liquors mentioned above, or any that may be more agreeable to his palate, or more readily obtained.</P>
<P>IF the patient be delirious, his feet and hands ought to be frequently fomented with &s;trong infu&s;ions of camomile flowers. This, or an infu&s;ion of the bark, to &s;uch as can afford it, cannot fail to have a good effect. Fomentations of this kind not only relieve the head, by relaxing the ve&s;|&s;els in the extremities, but as their contents are ab&s;orbed, and taken into the blood, they mu&s;t, by their anti&s;eptic qualities, a&s;&s;i&s;t in preventing the putre&s;cency of the humours.</P>
<P>IF the patient be not able to put his feet and hands into the decoction, cloths dipt in it may be applied to them.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;If a vomit be taken at the very be|ginning of this fever, it will hardly fail to have a good ef|fect; but if the fever has gone on for &s;ome days, and the &s;ymptoms are violent, vomits mu&s;t not be taken without proper advice.</P>
<P>BLEEDING is &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary in putrid fevers. If there be &s;igns of an inflammation, it may &s;ometimes be permitted at the fir&s;t on&s;et; but the repetition of it often proves fatal.</P>
<P>BLISTERING pla&s;ters are never to be u&s;ed unle&s;s in the greate&s;t extremities. If the petechiae, or &s;pots, &s;hould &s;ud|denly di&s;appear, the patient's pul&s;e &s;ink remarkably, and a delirium, with other bad &s;ymptoms, come on, bli&s;tering may be permitted. In this ca&s;e, the bli&s;tering pla&s;ters are to be applied to the head, and the in&s;ides of the legs or thighs. But as they are &s;ometimes apt to occa&s;ion a gan|grene, we would rather recommend warm poultices or cata|pla&s;ms to be applied to the feet, having recour&s;e to bli&s;ters only in the utmo&s;t extremities.</P>
<P>A very ridiculous notion has long prevailed, of expelling the poi&s;onous matter of malignant di&s;ea&s;es by &s;trong do&s;es
<PB N="142" REF="012338_0146_0F88E9E7C4D219B0">
of cordial or alexipharmic medicines. In con&s;equence of this notion, the contrayerva root, the cordial confection, and the mithridate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have been extolled as infallible re|medies. There is rea&s;on to believe, that the&s;e oftener do harm than good. Where cordials are nece&s;&s;ary, we know none that is &s;uperior to good wine; and therefore again re|commend it both as the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t. Wine, with other acid and anti&s;eptic medicines, are the only things to be re|lied on in the cure of malignant fevers.</P>
<P>WE have already recommended acids in various forms, and &s;hall only add one more, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> camphorated vinegar. This is made, by rubbing a dram of camphor, with a &s;mall quantity of &s;pirits of wine in a mortar, till it becomes &s;oft, then adding half an ounce of loaf-&s;ugar, and rubbing the whole together till perfectly united. Afterwards, take an Engli&s;h pint of warm vinegar, and add it by little and little, &s;till continuing the trituration, till they be uniformly mix|ed. Let it &s;tand to cool, and afterwards &s;train it. This may be taken in the do&s;e of a table &s;poonful or two, every two or three hours, according as it agrees with the &s;tomach. If it &s;hould heat the patient, or occa&s;ion a nau&s;ea, it mu&s;t be di&s;continued.</P>
<P>IN the mo&s;t dangerous &s;pecies of this di&s;ea&s;e, when it is attended with purple, livid, or black &s;pots, the Je&s;uits bark is the only medicine that can be depended upon. I have &s;een it, when joined with acids, almo&s;t perform wonders, even in ca&s;es where the petechiae had the mo&s;t threatening a&s;pect. But, to an&s;wer this purpo&s;e, it mu&s;t not only be given in large do&s;es, but duly per&s;i&s;ted in.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t method for admini&s;tering the bark is certainly in &s;ub&s;tance. An ounce of it, in powder, may be mixed with half an Engli&s;h pint of water, and the &s;ame quantity of red wine, and &s;harpened with the elixir of &s;pirit of vitriol, which will both make it &s;it ea&s;ier on the &s;tomach, and ren|der it more beneficial. Two or three ounces of the &s;yrup of lemon may be added, and two table &s;poonfuls of the mix|ture taken every two hours, or oftener, if the &s;tomach will bear it.</P>
<P>THOSE who cannot take the bark in &s;ub&s;tance may in|fu&s;e it in wine, as recommended in page 136.</P>
<P>IF there be a violent loo&s;ene&s;s, the bark mu&s;t be boiled in red wine, with a little cinnamon, and &s;harpened with the elixir of vitriol, as above. Nothing can be more beneficial
<PB N="143" REF="012338_0147_0F88E9EAEB966AB0">
in this kind of loo&s;ene&s;s than plenty of acids, and &s;uch things as promote the per&s;piration.</P>
<P>IF the patient be troubled with vomiting, a dram of the &s;alt of wormwood di&s;&s;olved in an ounce and an half of fre&s;h lemon juice, and made into a draught with an ounce of &s;imple cinnamon water, or peppermint water, and a bit of &s;ugar, may be given to the patient, and repeated as often as it is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IF &s;wellings of the glands appear, there &s;uppuration is to be promoted by the application of poultices, ripening cata|pla&s;ms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And as &s;oon as there is any appearance of mat|ter in them, they ought to be laid open, and the poultices continued.</P>
<P>I have known patients, in the decline of this fever, have large ulcerous &s;ores break out in various parts of the body, of a livid gangrenous appearance, and a mo&s;t putrid cada|verous &s;mell. The&s;e gradually healed, and the patient re|covered by the plentiful u&s;e of Je&s;uits bark mixed in wine, and &s;harpened with the &s;pirits of vitriol.</P>
<P>ALL who would avoid this dreadful di&s;ea&s;e, &s;hould &s;tudy univer&s;al cleanline&s;s, and &s;hould live regularly, avoiding the extremes of too high or too low a diet with equal care.</P>
<P>INFECTION, above all things, is to be avoided. No con|&s;titution is proof again&s;t it. I have known per&s;ons &s;eized with a putrid fever, by only making a &s;ingle vi&s;it to a pa|tient in it; others have caught it by going through a town where it prevailed; and &s;ome by attending the funerals of &s;uch as died of it.</P>
<P>ANY one who is apprehen&s;ive of having caught the in|fection, ought immediately to take a vomit, and to work it off by drinking plentifully of camomile tea. This may be repeated in a day or two, if the apprehen&s;ions &s;till continue, or any unfavourable &s;ymptoms appear.</P>
<P>THE per&s;on ought likewi&s;e to take an infu&s;ion of the bark and camomile flowers for his ordinary drink; and, be|fore he goes to bed, he may drink an Engli&s;h pint of pretty &s;trong negas, or a few gla&s;&s;es of generous wine. I have been frequently obliged to follow this cour&s;e when malig|nant fevers prevailed, and have likewi&s;e recommended it to others with con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>PEOPLE generally fly to bleeding and purging as antidotes again&s;t infection; but the&s;e are &s;o far from &s;ecuring them, that they often increa&s;e the danger.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="012338_0148_0F88E9ECC16DAD48">
PHYSICIANS, and &s;uch as attend the &s;ick in putrid fevers, ought always to have a piece of &s;punge, or a handkerchief dipt in vinegar, or juice of lemon, to hold at their no&s;e. They ought likewi&s;e to wa&s;h their hands, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to change their cloaths, before they vi&s;it any other patient.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE MILIARY FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS fever takes its name from the &s;mall pu&s;tules or bladders which appear on the &s;kin, re&s;embling, in &s;hape and &s;ize, the &s;eeds of millet. The pu&s;tules are either red or white, and &s;ometimes both are mixed together.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the whole body is covered with pu&s;tules; but they are generally more numerous where the &s;weat is mo&s;t abundant, as on the brea&s;t, the back, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A gentle &s;weat, or moi&s;ture on the &s;kin, greatly promotes the erup|tion; but where the &s;kin is dry, the eruption is both more painful and dangerous.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES this is a primary di&s;ea&s;e; but it is much of|tener only a &s;ymptom of &s;ome other malady, as the &s;mall|pox, mea&s;les, ardent, putrid, or nervous fever, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In all the&s;e ca&s;es it is generally the effect of too hot a regimen or medicines.</P>
<P>THE miliary fever chiefly attacks the idle and the phleg|matic, or per&s;ons of a relaxed habit. The young and the aged are more liable to it than tho&s;e in the vigour and prime of life. It is likewi&s;e more incident to women than men, e&s;pecially the delicate, and the indolent, who, neglecting ex|erci&s;e, keep continually within doors, and live upon weak, watery diet. Such females are extremely liable to be &s;eiz|ed with this di&s;ea&s;e in child-bed, and often lo&s;e their lives by it.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;The miliary fever is often occa&s;i|oned by violent pa&s;&s;ions or affections of the mind; as ex|ce&s;&s;ive grief, anxiety, thoughtfulne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It may like|wi&s;e be occa&s;ioned by exce&s;&s;ive watching, great evacuations, a weak, watery diet, rainy &s;ea&s;ons, eating too freely of cold, watery, unripe fruits, as plumbs, cherries, cucum|bers, melons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Impure waters, or provi&s;ions which have been &s;poiled by rainy &s;ea&s;ons, long keeping, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may likewi&s;e cau&s;e miliary fevers. They may al&s;o be occa&s;ion|ed by the &s;toppage of any cu&s;tomary evacuation, as i&s;&s;ues, &s;etons, ulcers, the bleeding piles in men, or the men&s;trual flux in women, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

THIS di&s;ea&s;e in childbed women i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ometimes the effect of great co&s;tivene&s;s during pregnancy; &s;ometimes it is oc|ca&s;ioned by their exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of green, unripe fruits, and other unwhole&s;ome things, in which pregnant women are too apt to indulge. But its mo&s;t general cau&s;e is in|dolence. Such women as indulge an ea&s;y, &s;edentary life, during pregnancy, and, at the &s;ame time, live gro&s;s and full, can hardly e&s;cape this di&s;ea&s;e in childbed. Hence it proves extremely fatal to women of fa&s;hion, and likewi&s;e to tho&s;e women in manufacturing towns, who, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t their hu&s;bands, &s;it clo&s;e, within doors, for almo&s;t the whole of their time. But, among women who are active and laborious, who live in the country, and take enough of exerci&s;e without doors, this di&s;ea&s;e is very little known.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;When this is a primary di&s;|ea&s;e, it makes its attack, like mo&s;t other eruptive fevers, with a &s;light &s;hivering, which is &s;ucceeded by heat, lo&s;s of &s;trength, fainti&s;hne&s;s, &s;ighing, a low quick pul&s;e, difficul|ty of breathing, with great anxiety and oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t. The patient is re&s;tle&s;s, and &s;ometimes delirious; the tongue appears white, and the hands &s;hake, with often a burning heat in the palms; and, in childbed wo|men, the milk generally goes away, and the other di&s;char|ges &s;top.</P>
<P>THE patient feels an itching or pricking pain under the &s;kin, after which innumerable &s;mall pu&s;tules of a red or white colour&punc; begin to appear. Upon this the &s;ymptoms generally abate, the pul&s;e becomes more full and &s;oft, the &s;kin grows moi&s;ter, and the &s;weat, as the di&s;ea&s;e advances, begins to have a peculiar foetid &s;mell; the great load on the brea&s;t, and oppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;pirits, generally go off, and the cu&s;tomary evacuations gradually return. About the &s;ixth or &s;eventh day from the eruption, the pu&s;tules be|gin to dry and fall off, which occa&s;ions a very di&s;agree|able itching in the &s;kin.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the exact time when the pu|&s;tules will either appear or go off. They generally come out on the third or fourth day, when the eruption is criti|cal; but, when &s;ymptomatical, they may appear at any time of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the pu&s;tules appear, and vani&s;h, by turns. When that is the ca&s;e, there is always danger; but when they &s;trike in, all of a &s;udden, and do not appear again, the danger is very great.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="012338_0150_0F88E9EE9718B840">
IN childbed women, the pu&s;tules are commonly at fir&s;t filled with clear water, afterwards they grow yellowi&s;h. Sometimes they are inter&s;per&s;ed with pu&s;tules of a red co|lour. When the&s;e only appear, the di&s;ea&s;e goes by the name of a <HI>ra&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;In all eruptive fevers, of what|ever kind, the chief point is to prevent the &s;udden &s;triking in of the pu&s;tules. For this purpo&s;e, the patient mu&s;t be kept in &s;uch a temperature, as neither to pu&s;h out the eruption too fa&s;t, nor cau&s;e it to retreat prematurely. The diet and drink ought therefore to be in a moderate degree, nouri&s;hing and cordial; but neither &s;trong nor heating. The patient's chamber ought neither to be kept too hot nor too cold; and he &s;hould not be too much covered with cloaths. Above all, the mind is to be kept ea&s;y and cheer|ful. Nothing &s;o certainly makes an eruption &s;trike in, as fear, or the apprehen&s;ion of danger.</P>
<P>THE food mu&s;t be weak chicken broth, with bread, wa|ter pap, with &s;ago, and groat gruel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to a gill of which may be added a &s;poonful or two of wine, as the patient's &s;trength requires, with a few grains of &s;alt and a little &s;u|gar. Good apples, roa&s;ted or boiled, with other ripe fruits, of an opening, cooling nature, may be eat.</P>
<P>THE drink mu&s;t be &s;uited to the &s;tate of the patient's &s;trength and &s;pirits. If the&s;e be pretty high, the drink ought to be weak; as water gruel, balm tea, or the fol|lowing decoction:</P>
<P>TAKE two ounces of the &s;havings of hart&s;horn, and the &s;ame quantity of &s;ar&s;aparilla, boil them in two Engli&s;h quarts of water. To the &s;trained decoction add a little white &s;ugar, and let the patient take it for his ordinary drink.</P>
<P>WHEN the patient's &s;pirits are low, and the eruption does not ri&s;e &s;ufficiently, his drink mu&s;t be a little more ge|nerous; as wine whey, or &s;mall negas, &s;harpened with the juice of orange or lemon, and made &s;tronger or weaker, as the circum&s;tances may require.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the miliary fever approaches towards a pu|trid nature; in which ca&s;e the patient's &s;trength mu&s;t be &s;upported with generous cordials, joined with acids; and if the degree of putre&s;cency be great, the Je&s;uits bark mu&s;t be admini&s;tered. If the head be much affected, the belly mu&s;t be kept open by emollient cly&s;ters.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Commercium Literarium</HI> for the year 1735, we have the the hi&s;tory of an epidemical miliary fever, which reged
<PB N="147" REF="012338_0151_0F88E9EF0090ED90">
at Stra&s;burg in the months of November, December, and January; from which we learn the nece&s;&s;ity of a temperate regimen in this di&s;ea&s;e, and likewi&s;e that phy&s;icians are not always the fir&s;t who di&s;cover the proper treatment of di&s;|ea&s;es. "This fever made terrible havoc among men of robu&s;t con&s;titutions, and all medicine proved in vain. They were &s;eized in an in&s;tant with &s;hivering, yawning, &s;tretch|ing, and pains in the back, &s;ucceeded by a mo&s;t inten&s;e heat; at the &s;ame time, there was a great lo&s;s of &s;trength and appetite. On the &s;eventh or ninth day the miliary eruptions appeared, or &s;pots like flea-bites, with great anxie|ty, a delirium, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and to&s;&s;ing in bed. Bleeding was fatal. While matters were in this unhappy &s;ituation, a midwife, of her own accord, gave to a patient, in the height of the di&s;ea&s;e, a cly&s;ter of rain-water and butter, without &s;alt, and for his ordinary drink a quart of &s;pring-water, half a pint of generous wine, the juice of one lemon, and &s;ix ounces of the white&s;t &s;ugar, gently boiled till a &s;cum aro&s;e, and this with great &s;ucce&s;s; for the belly was &s;oon loo&s;ened, the grievous &s;ymptoms vani&s;hed, and the patient was re&s;tored to his &s;en&s;es, and &s;natched from the jaws of death." This practice was imitated by others with the like happy effects.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;If the food and drink be properly regulated, there will be little occa&s;ion for medicine in this di&s;ea&s;e. Should the eruption, however, not ri&s;e, or the &s;pirits flag, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the patient with cordials, and to apply bli&s;ters. The mo&s;t proper cordial, in this ca&s;e, is good wine, which may either be taken in the patient's food or drink; and if there be any &s;igns of putre&s;|cency, which frequently happens, the bark and acids may be mixed with wine, as directed in the putrid fever.</P>
<P>SOME recommend bli&s;ters through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e; and where nature flags, and the eruption comes and goes, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to keep up a &s;timulus, by a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;mall bli&s;ters; but we would not re|commend above one at a time. If, however, the pul&s;e &s;hould &s;ink remarkably, the pu&s;tules &s;trike in, and the head be af|fected, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to apply &s;everal bli&s;tering pla&s;ters to the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible parts, as the in&s;ide of the legs and thighs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>BLEEDING is &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary in this di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;ome|times it does much hurt, as it weakens the patient, and de|pre&s;&s;es his &s;pirits. It is, therefore, never to be attempted
<PB N="148" REF="012338_0152_0F88E9EB8C0A1F70">
unle&s;s by the advice of a phy&s;ician. We mention this, be|cau&s;e it has been cu&s;tomary to treat this di&s;ea&s;e in childbed women by bleeding, and other evacuations, as if it were highly inflammatory. But this practice is generally very un&s;afe. Patients, in this &s;ituation, bear evacuations very ill. And, indeed, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;eems often to be more of a putrid than an inflammatory nature.</P>
<P>THOUGH this fever be often occa&s;ioned in childbed women by too hot a regimen, yet it would be dangerous to leave that off all of a &s;udden, and have recour&s;e to a very cool regimen, and large evacuations. We have rea&s;on to believe, that &s;upporting the patient's &s;pirits, and promoting the natural evacuations, is here much &s;afer than to have re|cour&s;e to artificial ones, as every thing that tends to depre&s;s the patient's &s;pirits con&s;tantly increa&s;es the danger.</P>
<P>IF this di&s;ea&s;e proves tedious, or the recovery &s;low, we would recommend the Je&s;uits bark, which may either be taken in &s;ub&s;tance, or infu&s;ed in wine or water, as the pa|tient inclines.</P>
<P>THE miliary fever, like other eruptive di&s;ea&s;es, after it is gone, requires purging, which &s;hould not be neglected as &s;oon as the patient's &s;trength will permit.</P>
<P>To avoid this di&s;ea&s;e, a pure dry air, plenty of exerci&s;e and whole&s;ome food, are nece&s;&s;ary. Pregnant women &s;hould guard again&s;t co&s;tivene&s;s, and take daily as much exerci&s;e as they can bear, avoiding all green tra&s;hy fruits, and other unwhole&s;ome things; and when in childbed, they ought &s;trictly to ob&s;erve a cool regimen.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE SMALL-POX.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o general, that very few e&s;cape it at one time of life or another. It is the mo&s;t contagious malady in the&s;e parts; and has, for upwards of a thou&s;and years, proved the &s;courge of Europe.</P>
<P>THE &s;mall-pox generally appear towards the &s;pring. They are very frequent in &s;ummer, le&s;s &s;o in autumn, and lea&s;t of all in winter. Children are mo&s;t liable to this di&s;|ea&s;e; and tho&s;e who&s;e food is unwhole&s;ome, who want pro|per exerci&s;e, and abound with gro&s;s humours, run the greate&s;t hazard from it.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;e is di&s;tingui&s;hed into the di&s;tinct and conflu|ent kind; the latter of which is always attended with dan|ger.
<PB N="149" REF="012338_0153_0F88E9F0A08DADE0">
There are likewi&s;e other di&s;tinctions of the &s;mall-pox; as the lymphatic, the cry&s;talline, the bloody, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;The &s;mall-pox are commonly caught by infection. Since the di&s;ea&s;e was brought into Europe, the infection has never been wholely extingui&s;hed; nor have any proper methods, &s;o far as we know, ever been taken for that purpo&s;e; &s;o that now it has become in a manner con|&s;titutional. Children who have over-heated them&s;elves by running, wre&s;tling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or adults after a debauch, are very apt to be &s;eized with this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;This di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o generally known, that a minute de&s;cription of it is unnece&s;&s;ary. Children commonly look a little dull, &s;eem li&s;tle&s;s and drow&s;y for a few days before the more violent &s;ymptoms of the &s;mall-pox appear. They are likewi&s;e more inclined to drink than u&s;ual, have little appetite for &s;olid food, complain of weari|ne&s;s, and, upon taking exerci&s;e, are apt to &s;weat. The&s;e are &s;ucceeded by &s;light fits of cold and heat in turns, which, as the time of the eruption approaches, become more vio|lent, and are accompanied with pains of the head and loins, vomiting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The pul&s;e is quick, with a great heat of the &s;kin, and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s. When the patient drops a&s;leep, he wakes in a kind of horror, with a &s;udden &s;tart, which is a very common &s;ymptom of the approaching eruption; as are al&s;o convul&s;ion fits in very young children.</P>
<P>ABOUT the third or fourth day from the time of &s;icken|ing, the &s;mall-pox generally begin to appear; &s;ometimes, indeed, they appear &s;ooner, but that is no advantage. At fir&s;t they very nearly re&s;emble flea-bites, and are mo&s;t early di&s;covered on the face, arms and brea&s;t.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t favourable &s;ymptoms are a &s;low eruption, and an abatement of the fever as &s;oon as the pu&s;tules appear. In a mild di&s;tinct kind of &s;mall-pox, the pu&s;tules &s;eldom ap|pear before the fourth day from the time of &s;ickening, and they generally keep coming out gradually for &s;everal days after. Pu&s;tules, which are di&s;tinct, with a florid red ba&s;is, and which fill with thick purulent matter, fir&s;t of a whiti&s;h, and afterwards of a yellowi&s;h colour, are the be&s;t.</P>
<P>A livid brown colour of the pu&s;tules is an unfavourable &s;ymptom; as al&s;o, when they are &s;mall and flat, with black &s;pecks in the middle. Pu&s;tules which contain a thin wa|tery ichor are very bad. A great number of pox on the face is always a bad &s;ign, e&s;pecially if they be confluent, or run into one another.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="012338_0154_0F88E9B65B38CFA0">
BUT the mo&s;t unfavourable &s;ymptom is the petechiae, or purple, brown and black &s;pots inter&s;per&s;ed among the pu&s;tules. The&s;e are &s;igns of a putrid di&s;&s;olution of the blood, and &s;how the danger to be very great. Bloody &s;tools or urine, with a &s;welled belly, are bad &s;ymptoms; as is al&s;o, a continual &s;trangury. When the urine is very pale, and there is a violent throbbing of the arteries of the neck, it portends a delirium or convul&s;ion fits. When the face does not &s;well, or falls before the pox come to maturity, it is a very bad &s;ign. If the face begins to fall about the eleventh or twelfth day, and the hands begin to &s;well, and afterwards the feet, the patient generally does well; but when the&s;e do not &s;ucceed, there is rea&s;on to apprehend danger. When the tongue is covered with a brown cru&s;t, it is an unfavourable &s;ymptom. Cold &s;hivering fits coming on at the height of the di&s;ea&s;e, are likewi&s;e unfavourable. Grinding of the teeth, when it proceeds from an affection of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, is a bad &s;ign; but, &s;ometimes, it is oc|ca&s;ioned by worms, or a di&s;ordered &s;tomach.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;When the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of the &s;mall-pox appear, people are ready to be alarmed, and often fly to the u&s;e of medicine, to the great danger of the pa|tient's life. I have known children, to appea&s;e the anxiety of their parents, bled, bli&s;tered, purged, and vomited, during the fever which preceded the eruption of the &s;mall-pox, to &s;uch a degree, that nature was not only di&s;turbed in her operation, but rendered unable to &s;upport the pu&s;tules after they were out; &s;o that the patient, exhau&s;ted by mere eva|cuations, &s;unk under the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN convul&s;ions appear, they give a dreadful alarm. Immediately &s;ome no&s;trum is applied, as if this were a pri|mary di&s;ea&s;e; whereas, it is only a &s;ymptom, and far from being an unfavourable one, of the approaching eruption. As the fits generally go off before the actual appearance of the &s;mall-pox, it is attributed to the medicine, which, by this means, acquires a reputation without any merit.</P>
<P>ALL that is, generally &s;peaking, nece&s;&s;ary during the eruptive fever, is to keep the patient within doors, and to allow him to drink freely of &s;ome weak diluting liquors; as balm tea, barley water, clear whey, gruels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He &s;hould neither be kept in too warm a room, nor confined to bed; but &s;hould &s;it up as much as he is able, and &s;hould have his feet and legs frequently bathed in lukewarm water.
<PB N="151" REF="012338_0155_0F88E9F12F1BD080">
His food, if he takes any, ought to be very light; and he &s;hould be as little di&s;turbed with noi&s;e and company as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>MUCH mi&s;chief is done at this period by confining the patient too &s;oon to his bed, and plying him with warm cordials, or &s;udorific medicines. Every thing that heats and inflames the blood, increa&s;es the fever, and pu&s;hes out the pu&s;tules too fa&s;t. This has numberle&s;s ill effects. It not only increa&s;es the number of pu&s;tules, but likewi&s;e tends to make them run into one another; and when they have been pu&s;hed out with too great violence, they gene|rally fall in before they come to maturity.</P>
<P>THE good women, as &s;oon as they &s;ee the &s;mall-pox begin to appear, commonly ply their tender charge with cordials, &s;affron or marygold teas, wines, punch, and even brandy it&s;elf. All the&s;e are given with a view to throw out the eruption, as they pretend, from the heart. This, like mo&s;t other popular mi&s;takes, is the abu&s;e of a very ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, <HI>That when there is a moi&s;ture on the &s;kin, the pox ri&s;e better, and the patient is ea&s;ier than when it continues dry and parched.</HI> But that is no rea&s;on for forcing the patient into a &s;weat. Sweating never relieves, unle&s;s where it comes &s;pontaneou&s;ly, or is the effect of drinking weak di|luting liquors.</P>
<P>THE patient ought to have no more covering in bed than is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent his catching cold, and he &s;hould be frequently taken up, if it were only for a few minutes; this will both keep him cool, and prevent too great a flux of blood towards the head.</P>
<P>CHILDREN are often &s;o peevi&s;h that they will not lie a-bed without a nur&s;e con&s;tantly by them. This, we have rea&s;on to believe, has many bad effects. Even the natural heat of the nur&s;e cannot fail to augment the fever of the child; but if &s;he too proves feveri&s;h, the danger mu&s;t be increa&s;ed. I have known a nur&s;e contract a malignant fe|ver, by lying in bed with a child the whole time of its be|ing ill of a bad kind of &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>LAYING &s;everal children who have the &s;mall-pox in the &s;ame bed, has many ill con&s;equences. They ought, if po&s;|&s;ible, never to be in the &s;ame chamber, as the per&s;piration, the heat, and the &s;mell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all tend to augment the fever, and to heighten the di&s;ea&s;e. It is common, among the poor, to &s;ee two or three children lying in the &s;ame bed, with &s;uch a load of pu&s;tules, that their very &s;kins &s;tick to|gether.
<PB N="152" REF="012338_0156_0F88E9F3385FEA50">
One can hardly view a &s;cene of this kind without being &s;ickened by the &s;ight and &s;mell. How much more mu&s;t the&s;e affect the poor patients, many of whom peri&s;h by this u&s;age?</P>
<P>THIS ob&s;ervation is likewi&s;e applicable to ho&s;pitals, workhou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where numbers of children happen to have the &s;mall-pox at the &s;ame time. I have &s;een above forty children cooped up in one apartment all the while they had this di&s;ea&s;e, without any of them being admitted to breathe the fre&s;h air. No one can be at a lo&s;s to &s;ee the impropriety of &s;uch conduct, which generally proceeds from a piece of ill-judged oeconomy, to &s;ave the trifling ex|pence of a few nur&s;es. It ought to be a rule, not only in ho&s;pi|tals for the &s;mall-pox, but likewi&s;e for other di&s;ea&s;es, that no patient &s;hould be within &s;ight or hearing of another. This is a matter to which too little regard is paid in mo&s;t ho&s;pitals and infirmaries, where the &s;ick, the dying, and the dead are often to be &s;een in the &s;ame apartment.</P>
<P>A very dirty cu&s;tom prevails among&s;t the lower &s;ort of people, of allowing children in the &s;mall-pox to keep on the &s;ame linen during the whole period of that loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;e. This is done le&s;t they &s;hould catch cold, but it has many ill con&s;equences. The linen becomes hard, by the moi&s;ture which it ab&s;orbs, and frets the tender &s;kin. It likewi&s;e occa&s;ions a bad &s;mell, which is very pernicious both to the patient, and tho&s;e about him; be&s;ides the filth and &s;ordes, which adhere to the linen, being ab&s;orbed, or taken up again into the body, greatly augment the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A patient &s;hould not be kept dirty in any di&s;ea&s;e, e&s;pe|cially in the &s;mall-pox. Cutaneous di&s;orders are often oc|ca&s;ioned by na&s;tine&s;s alone, and are always increa&s;ed by it. Were the patient's linen to be changed every day, it would greatly refre&s;h him. Care, indeed, is to be taken that the linen be thoroughly dry. It ought, likewi&s;e, to be warm|ed, and put on when the patient is mo&s;t cool.</P>
<P>SO &s;trong is the vulgar prejudice in this country, notwith|&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid again&s;t keeping children too warm in the &s;mall-pox, that numbers &s;till fall a &s;acrifice to that error. I have &s;een poor women travelling in the depth of winter, and carrying their children along with them in the &s;mall-pox; and have frequently ob&s;erved others begging by the way-&s;ide, with infants in their arms, covered with the pu&s;tules; yet I could never learn that one of the&s;e chil|dren died by this &s;ort of treatment. We would not, however,
<PB N="153" REF="012338_0157_0F88E9F3C154A708">
propo&s;e this as an example worthy of imitation; we only mention it to &s;hew, that the danger of expo&s;ing children to the open air in this di&s;ea&s;e is not &s;o great as people are apt to imagine.</P>
<P>STRONG prejudices, when got over, often produce the oppo&s;ite extreme. We would, therefore, advi&s;e people, when they avoid one error, not to run into another. Some celebrated inoculators order their patients to walk about all the while they are under the di&s;ea&s;e, as if nothing were the matter. We &s;hould think it advi&s;able, however, to keep within doors, at lea&s;t during the eruption, as cold air is apt to check the per&s;piration, and to prevent the pox from ri&s;ing, or filling with matter. I do not remember ever to have &s;een large, well-filled pu&s;tules where the patient was expo&s;ed to the external air. In winter the air of this coun|try is abundantly cool within doo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and in &s;ummer a patient may be kept more uniformly cool in the hou&s;e than he can be out of it. For the&s;e, and other rea&s;ons, we &s;hould think it right to confine the patient to the hou&s;e while the eruption is out; but never to allow the heat of his chamber to be greater than is agreeable to a per&s;on in perfect health.</P>
<P>THE food in this di&s;ea&s;e ought to be very light, and of a cooling nature, as water pap, rice, or bread, boiled with milk, good apples, roa&s;ted, or boiled with milk, and &s;weetened with a little &s;ugar, or &s;uch like.</P>
<P>THE drink may be equal parts of milk and water, clear &s;weet whey, barley water, or thin gruel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> After the pox are full, butter-milk is an excellent drink, it being of an opening and clean&s;ing nature.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;This di&s;ea&s;e is generally divi|ded into four different periods, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the fever which pre|cedes the eruption, the eruption it&s;elf, the &s;uppuration, or maturation of the pu&s;tules, and the &s;econdary fever.</P>
<P>IT has already been ob&s;erved, that little more is nece&s;&s;ary during the primary fever, than to keep the patient cool and quiet, allowing him to drink diluting liquors, and bathing his feet frequently in warm water. Though this be gene|rally the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e that can be taken with infants, yet adults of a &s;trong con&s;titution and plethoric habit &s;ome|times require bleeding. When a pul&s;e, a dry &s;kin, and other &s;ymptoms of inflammation, render this operation ne|ce&s;&s;ary, it ought to be performed. But, unle&s;s the&s;e &s;ymptoms are urgent, it is &s;afer to tru&s;t to fomentations;
<PB N="154" REF="012338_0158_0F88E9F432C0D7F8">
and, if the belly be bound, emollient cly&s;ters may be thrown in.</P>
<P>IF there be a great nau&s;ea or vomiting, weak camomile tea, or lukewarm water, may be drank, in order to clean the &s;tomach. At the beginning of a fever, nature general|ly attempts a di&s;charge, either upwards or downwards; which, if promoted by gentle means, would tend greatly to abate the force or violence of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THOUGH every method is to be taken during the prima|ry fever, by a cool regimen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to prevent too great an eruption; yet, after the pu&s;tules have made their appear|ance, our bu&s;ine&s;s is to promote the &s;uppuration, by gen|tle warmth, diluting drink, light food, and, if nature &s;eems to flag, by generous cordials; but the latter ought never to be given unle&s;s where there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;i|ty. When a low, creeping pul&s;e, fainti&s;hne&s;s, and great lo&s;s of &s;trength, render cordials nece&s;&s;ary, we would re|commend good wine, which may be made into negas, with an equal quantity of water, and &s;harpened with the juice of orange, the jelly of currants, or the like. Wine whey, &s;harpened as above, is likewi&s;e a proper drink in this ca&s;e; great care, however, mu&s;t be taken not to overheat the pa|tient by any of the&s;e things. This would retard in&s;tead of promoting the eruption.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the ri&s;ing of the &s;mall-pox is prevented by the violence of the fever; in which ca&s;e, the cool regimen is &s;trictly to be ob&s;erved. For example, the patient's chamber mu&s;t be kept cool; he ought likewi&s;e frequently to be taken out of bed, and to be lightly covered with cloaths while in it.</P>
<P>EXCESSIVE re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s often prevents the ri&s;ing and fill|ing of the &s;mall-pox. When that happens, gentle opiates are nece&s;&s;ary. The&s;e, however, ought always to be ad|mini&s;tered with the greate&s;t caution. To an infant, a tea &s;poonful of the &s;yrup of poppies may be given every five or &s;ix hours, till it has the de&s;ired effect. An adult per&s;on will require a table &s;poonful in order to an&s;wer the &s;ame pur|po&s;e; and to others, the do&s;e mu&s;t be proportioned to their age, and the violence of the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>IF the patient be troubled with a &s;trangury, or &s;uppre&s;|&s;ion of urine, which often happens in the &s;mall-pox, he &s;hould be frequently taken out of bed, and, if he be able, &s;hould walk acro&s;s the room with his feet bare. When he cannot do this, he may be frequently &s;et on his knees in
<PB N="155" REF="012338_0159_0F88E9F4F041AB10">
bed, and &s;hould endeavour to pa&s;s his urine as often as he can. When the&s;e do not &s;ucceed, a tea &s;poonful of the &s;weet &s;pirits of nitre may be occa&s;ionally mixed in his drink. Nothing more certainly relieves the patient, or is more be|neficial in the &s;mall-pox, than a plentiful di&s;charge of urine.</P>
<P>IF the mouth be foul, and the tongue dry and chapped, it ought to be frequently wa&s;hed, and the throat gargled with warm water and honey, &s;harpened with a little vinegar or currant jelly.</P>
<P>DURING the ri&s;ing of the &s;mall-pox, it frequently hap|pens that the patient is eight or ten days without a &s;tool. This not only tends to heat and inflame the blood, but the foeces, by lodging &s;o long in the body, become acrid and even putrid, from whence bad con&s;equences mu&s;t en&s;ue. It will therefore be proper, when the belly is bound, to throw in an emollient cly&s;ter every &s;econd or third day, through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. This will greatly cool and relieve the patient.</P>
<P>WHEN petechiae, or purple, black, or livid &s;pots appear among the &s;mall-pox, the Je&s;uits bark mu&s;t immediately be admini&s;tered in as large do&s;es as the patient's &s;tomach can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear. For a child, two drams of the bark in powder may be mixed in three ounces of common water, one ounce of &s;imple cinnamon-water, and two ounces of the &s;yrup of orange or lemon. This may be &s;harpened with the &s;pirits of vitriol, and a table &s;poonful of it given every hour. If it be given to an adult in the &s;ame form, he may take at lea&s;t three or four &s;poonfuls every hour. This medicine ought not to be trifled with, but mu&s;t be thrown in as fa&s;t as the &s;tomach can bear; in which ca&s;e it will often produce very happy effects. I have frequently &s;een the petechiae di&s;ap|pear, and &s;mall-pox, which had a very threatening a&s;pect, ri&s;e and fill with laudable matter, by the u&s;e of the Je&s;uits bark and acids.</P>
<P>THE patient's drink ought likewi&s;e, in this ca&s;e, to be acidulated with the &s;pirits of vitriol, vinegar, juice of le|mon, jelly of currants, or &s;uch like. His food mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of apples, roa&s;ted or boiled, pre&s;erved cherries, plumbs and other &s;harp fruits.</P>
<P>CAMOMILE tea, if the patient's &s;tomach will bear it, is likewi&s;e a very proper drink in this ca&s;e. It may be &s;harpen|ed with any of the acids mentioned above, and drank at plea&s;ure. When the pul&s;e and &s;pirits are low, red wine
<PB N="156" REF="012338_0160_0F88E9F5CC28BF48">
negas, or pretty &s;trong wine whey, &s;harpened with the juice of lemon, mu&s;t be given for the patient's ordinary drink.</P>
<P>THE bark and acids are not only nece&s;&s;ary when the pe|techiae or putrid &s;ymptoms appear, but likewi&s;e in the lym|phatic or cry&s;talline &s;mall-pox, where the matter is thin, and not duly prepared. The Je&s;uits bark &s;eems po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;ingular power to a&s;&s;i&s;t nature in preparing laudable pus, or what is called good matter; con&s;equently it mu&s;t be very beneficial, both in this and other di&s;ea&s;es who&s;e cri&s;is depends on a &s;uppuration. I have often ob&s;erved, where the &s;mall-pox were flat, and the matter contained in them quite clear and tran&s;parent, and where they had the appearance of running into one another, that the u&s;e of a few drams of the Je&s;uits bark, acidulated as above, not only promoted the &s;uppuration, but changed the colour and con&s;i&s;tence of the matter, and produced the mo&s;t happy effects.</P>
<P>WHEN the eruption &s;ub&s;ides &s;uddenly, or, as the good women term it, when the &s;mall-pox &s;trike in, before they have arrived at maturity, the danger is very great. This is often the effect of a hot regimen, or medicines which at the beginning pu&s;h out the matter before it has been properly prepared. When this happens, bli&s;tering pla&s;ters mu&s;t be immediately applied to the wri&s;ts and ancles, and the pa|tient's &s;pirits &s;upported with cordials.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES bleeding has a &s;urpri&s;ing effect in rai&s;ing the pu&s;tules after they have &s;ub&s;ided; but it requires &s;kill to know when this is proper, or to what length the patient can bear it. Sharp catapla&s;ms, however, may be applied to the feet and hands, as they tend to promote the &s;welling of the&s;e parts, and by that means to draw the humour towards the extremities.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t dangerous period of the di&s;ea&s;e is what we call the &s;econdary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ever. This generally c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mes on when the &s;mall-pox begin to turn on the face; and mo&s;t of tho&s;e who die of the &s;mall-pox are carried off by this fever.</P>
<P>NATURE generally attempts, at the turn of the &s;mall|pox to relieve the patient by loo&s;e &s;tools. Her endeavours this way, are by no means to be counteracted, but promoted, and the patient at the &s;ame time &s;upported by things of a light but nouri&s;hing nature. Patients have often been re|markably relieved at this time by a few loo&s;e &s;tools, either brought on by nature or procured by art. That &s;hould
<PB N="157" REF="012338_0161_0F88E9F66B75C738">
encourage us to endeavour to a&s;&s;i&s;t nature in this way, e&s;pe|cially if the &s;ymptoms be threatening, and the belly con|tinues bound.</P>
<P>IF at the approach of the &s;econdary fever, the pul&s;e be very quick, hard, and &s;trong, the heat inten&s;e, and the breathing laborious, with other &s;ymptoms of an inflamma|tion of the brea&s;t, the patient mu&s;t immediately be bled, otherwi&s;e a fatal peripneumony will en&s;ue. The quantity of blood to be let mu&s;t be regulated by the patient's &s;trength, age, and the urgency of the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>BUT, in the &s;econdary fever, if the patient be fainti&s;h, the pu&s;tules become pale and &s;hrink, and if there be great coldne&s;s of the extremities, bli&s;tering pla&s;ters mu&s;t be ap|plied, and the patient mu&s;t be &s;upported with generous wine. Wine, and even &s;pirits have &s;ometimes been given in &s;uch de&s;perate ca&s;es with amazing &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>AS the &s;econdary fever is in great mea&s;ure, if not whole|ly, owing to the ab&s;orption of the matter, it would &s;eem highly con&s;onant to rea&s;on, that the pu&s;tules, as &s;oon as they come to maturity, &s;hould be opened. That is every day practi&s;ed in other phlegmons which tend to &s;uppura|tion; and there &s;eems to be no rea&s;on why it &s;hould be le&s;s proper here. On the contrary, we have rea&s;on to believe, that by this means the &s;econdary fever might always be le&s;&s;ened, and often wholely prevented.</P>
<P>THE pu&s;tules &s;hould be opened when they begin to turn of a yellow colour. Very little art is nece&s;&s;ary for this operation. They may either be opened with a pair of &s;ci&s;|&s;ors, or a needle, and the matter ab&s;orbed by a wet &s;punge, or a little lint. As the pu&s;tules are generally fir&s;t ripe on the face, it will be proper to begin with opening the&s;e, and the others in cour&s;e as they become ripe. The pu&s;tules generally fill again, a &s;econd, or even a third time, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which cau&s;e the operation mu&s;t be repeated, or rather continued &s;o long as there is any con&s;iderable appearance of matter in the pu&s;tules.</P>
<P>WE have rea&s;on to believe, that this operation, rational as it is, has been neglected from a piece of mi&s;taken tender|ne&s;s in parents. They believe, that it mu&s;t be great pain to the poor child; and therefore would rather &s;ee it die than have it thus tortured. This notion, however, is en|tirely without foundation. It is only the &s;carf-&s;kin that is cut, which, upon the top of the pu&s;tules, by the time they are ripe, becomes quite in&s;en&s;ible. I have frequently open|ed
<PB N="158" REF="012338_0162_0F88E9F978F31618">
the pu&s;tules when the patients did not &s;ee me, without their being in the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible of it; but &s;uppo&s;e it were attended with a little pain, that is nothing in compari&s;on to the advantages which ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P>OPENING the pu&s;tules not only prevents the ab&s;orption of the matter into the blood, but likewi&s;e takes off ten&s;ion of the &s;kin, and by that means greatly relieves the patient. It likewi&s;e prevents the pitting, which is a matter of no &s;mall importance. Acrid matter, by lodging long in the pu&s;tules, cannot fail to corrode the tender &s;kin; by which many a hand&s;ome face becomes &s;o deformed as hardly to bear a re&s;emblance to the human figure.</P>
<P>IT is always nece&s;&s;ary, after the &s;mall-pox are gone off, to purge the patient. If, however, the belly has been open through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, or, if butter-milk, and other things of an opening nature, have been given, after the height of the &s;mall-pox, purging becomes le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary; but it ought never wholely to be neglected.</P>
<P>FOR very young children, an infu&s;ion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">enna and prunes, with a little rhubarb, may be &s;weetened with manna or coar&s;e &s;ugar, and given in &s;mall quantities till it operates. Tho&s;e who are farther advanced mu&s;t take me|dicines of a &s;harper nature. For example, a child of four or five years of age, may take ten grains of fine rhubarb in powder over night, and the &s;ame quantity of jalap in powder next morning, with two or three grains of calomel, mixed in currant jelly, or made into a bolus with a little honey. He ought to keep the hou&s;e all day, and to drink nothing that is cold. The do&s;e may be repeated three or four times, five or &s;ix days intervening betwixt each do&s;e. For children further advanced, and adults, the do&s;e mu&s;t be increa&s;ed in proportion to the age and con&s;titution.</P>
<P>WHEN impo&s;thumes happen after the &s;mall-pox, which is not &s;eldom the ca&s;e, they are to be brought to &s;uppurati|on as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, by means of ripening poultices; and, when they have been opened, or break of their own accord, the patient mu&s;t be purged.</P>
<P>WHEN a cough, a difficulty of breathing, or other &s;ym|toms of a con&s;umption, &s;ucceed to the &s;mall-pox, the pa|tient mu&s;t be &s;ent to a well aired place, and put upon a cour&s;e of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> milk, with &s;uch exerci&s;e as he can bear.

<P>THOUGH no di&s;ea&s;e, after it is formed, baffles the pow|ers of medicine more than the &s;mall-pox, yet more may be

done before hand to render this di&s;ea&s;e favourable than any one w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">now, as almo&s;t all the danger from it may be pre|vented by inoculation.

It mu&s;t, however, be acknowledged, to the honour of this country, that inoculation has met with a more favourable reception here than by any of our neighbours. It is &s;till, however, far from being general, which we have rea&s;on to fear will ever be the ca&s;e, &s;o long as the practice continues in the hands of the faculty.</P>
<P>NO di&s;covery can ever be of general utillity while the practice of it is kept in the hands of a few. Had the inocu|lation of the &s;mall-pox been introduced as a fa&s;hion, and not as a medical di&s;covery, and had it been practi&s;ed by the &s;ame kind of operators here as it is in tho&s;e countries from whence we had it, it had long ago been univer&s;al. The fears, the jealou&s;ies, the prejudices, and the oppo&s;ite inte|re&s;ts of the faculty, are, and ever will be, the mo&s;t effectual ob&s;tacles to the progre&s;s of any &s;alutary di&s;covery. Hence it is, that the practice of inoculation never became, in any mea&s;ure, general, even in England, till taken up by men not bred to phy&s;ic. The&s;e have not only rendered the practice more exten&s;ive, but likewi&s;e more &s;afe, and, by acting under le&s;s re&s;traint than the regular practitioners, have taught them that the patient's greate&s;t danger aro&s;e, not from the want of care, but from the exce&s;s of it.</P>
<P>THEY know very little of the matter, who impute the &s;ucce&s;s of modern inoculators to any &s;uperior &s;kill, either in preparing the patient or communicating the di&s;ea&s;e. Some operators indeed, from a &s;ordid de&s;ire of ingro&s;&s;ing the whole practice to them&s;elves, pretend to have extraordi|nary &s;ecrets or no&s;trums in preparing per&s;ons for inoculation, which never fail of &s;ucce&s;s. But this is only a pretence calculated to blind the ignorant and inattentive. Com|mon &s;en&s;e and prudence alone are &s;ufficient both in the choice of the &s;ubject, and management of the operation. Whoever is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e may perform this office for his children whenever he finds it convenient, provided they be in a proper &s;tate of health; and may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that he will &s;ucceed as well as the mo&s;t celebrated inoculator.</P>
<P>THIS &s;entiment is not the re&s;ult of theory, but of ob&s;erva|tion. Though few phy&s;icians have had more opportuni|ties of trying inoculation in all its different forms, &s;o little
<PB N="160" REF="012338_0164_0F88E9FAEDC679B0">
appears to me to depend on the&s;e, generally reckoned im|portant circum&s;tances, of preparing the body, communi|cating the infection by this or the other method, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that for &s;everal years pa&s;t I have cau&s;ed the parents or nur&s;es perform the whole them&s;elves, and have found that method followed with equal &s;ucce&s;s, while it is free from many in|conveniencies that attend the other.</P>
<P>A critical &s;ituation, too often to be met with, fir&s;t put me upon trying this method. A gentleman who had lo&s;t all his children, except one &s;on, by the natural &s;mall-pox, was determined to have him inoculated. He told me his intention, and de&s;ired I would per&s;uade the mother and grandmother, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of its propriety. But that was impo&s;&s;i|ble. They were not to be per&s;uaded, and either could not get the better of their fears, or were determined again&s;t con|viction. It was always a point with me not to perform the operation without the con&s;ent of parties concerned. I therefore advi&s;ed the father, after giving his &s;on a do&s;e or two of rhubarb, to go to a patient who had the &s;mall-pox of a good kind, to open two or three of the pu&s;tules, taking up the matter with a little cotton, and as &s;oon as he came home to take his &s;on into a private room, and give his arm a &s;light &s;cratch with a pin, as if it had been by accident, afterwards to rub the place well with the cotton, and take no farther notice of it. All this he punctually performed; and, at the u&s;ual period, the &s;mall-pox made their appear|ance, which were of an exceeding good kind, and &s;o mild as not to confine the boy an hour to his bed. None of the other relations knew but the di&s;ea&s;e had come in the natural way till the patient was well.</P>
<P>WE do not propo&s;e this as the only method in which the &s;mall-pox can be communicated. It appears from experience, that this may be done various ways with equal &s;ucce&s;s. In Tur|key, from whence we learned the practice, the women commu|nicate the di&s;ea&s;e to children, by opening a bit of the &s;kin with a needle, and putting into the wound a little matter taken from a ripe pu&s;tule. On the coa&s;t of Barbary, they pa&s;s a thread wet with the matter through the &s;kin, between the thumb and fore-finger; and in Europe inoculation is generally performed by making a &s;mall inci&s;ion through the cuticle of the arm or leg with a lancet, and laying a bit of thread wet with the matter upon the wound, which is co|vered with a piece of &s;ticking pla&s;ter, and kept on for two or three days.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="012338_0165_0F88E9FBAE2D8C68">
SOME of the people in England, who make a trade of inoculation, only open one of the ripe pu&s;tules with a lan|cet, and while it is wet with the matter, make a &s;light in|ci&s;ion in the arm of the per&s;on to whom they want to com|municate the di&s;ea&s;e; afterwards they clo&s;e up the wound, and leave it without any other dre&s;&s;ing. This &s;eems to be no real improvement. It frequently fails to communicate the di&s;ea&s;e, and is far le&s;s certain than when a &s;cratch with a pin or needle is made, and a bit of thread wet with the matter kept on the wound for &s;ome days by a &s;ticking pla|&s;ter.</P>
<P>INDEED, if the matter be applied long enough to the &s;kin, there is no occa&s;ion for any wound at all. Let a bit of thread, about half an inch long, wet with the matter, be applied to the arm, midway between the &s;houlder and elbow, and covered with a piece of the common black &s;ticking pla&s;ter, and kept on for eight or ten days. This will &s;eldom fail to communicate the di&s;ea&s;e. We mention this method, becau&s;e many people are afraid of a wound; and, doubtle&s;s, the more ea&s;ily the operation can be per|formed, it has the greater chance to become general. Some people imagine, that the di&s;charge from a wound le&s;&s;ens the eruption; but there is not much &s;tre&s;s to be laid upon this notion: Be&s;ides, deep wounds often ulcerate, and be|come trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>WE do not find that inoculation is at all con&s;idered as a medical operation in tho&s;e countries from whence we learn|ed it. In Turkey it is performed by the women, and in the Ea&s;t-Indies by the Brachmins or prie&s;ts. In this coun|try the cu&s;tom is &s;till in its infancy; we make no doubt, however, but it will become &s;o familiar, that parents will think no more of inoculating their own children than at pre&s;ent they do of giving them a do&s;e of phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>NO &s;et of men have it &s;o much in their power to render the practice of inoculation general as the clergy; the great|e&s;t oppo&s;ition to it &s;till ari&s;ing from &s;ome &s;cruples of con|&s;cience, which they alone can remove. We would recom|mend it to them, not only to endeavour to remove the re|ligious objections which weak minds may have to this &s;alu|tary practice, but to enjoin it as a duty, and to point out the danger of neglecting to make u&s;e of a mean which Pro|vidence has put in our power for &s;aving the lives of our offspring. Surely &s;uch parents as wilfully neglect th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> means of &s;aving their children alive, are as guilty as tho&s;e who
<PB N="162" REF="012338_0166_0F88E9FC6D1751D8">
put them to death. We wi&s;h this matter were duly weigh|ed. No one is more ready to make allowance for human weakne&s;s and religious prejudices, yet I cannot help recom|mending it, in the warme&s;t manner, to parents to con&s;ider how great an injury they do their children, by neglecting to give them this di&s;ea&s;e in the early period of life.</P>
<P>THE numerous advantages attending inoculation of the &s;mall-pox, have been pretty fully pointed out by the learn|ed Dr. McKenzie in his Hi&s;tory of Health: "Many and great, &s;ays this humane author, are the dangers attending the natural infection, from all which the inoculation is quite &s;ecure. The natural infection may invade weak or di&s;tempered bodies, by no means di&s;po&s;ed for its kindly reception. It may attack them at a &s;ea&s;on of the year either violently hot, or inten&s;ely cold. It may be commu|nicated from a &s;ort of &s;mall-pox impregnated with the ut|mo&s;t virulence. It may lay hold upon people unexpect|edly, when a dangerous &s;ort is imprudently imported into a maritime place. It may &s;urprize us &s;oon after exce&s;&s;es committed in luxury, intemperance, or lewdne&s;s. It may likewi&s;e &s;eize on the innocent, after indi&s;pen&s;ible watch|ings, hard labour, or nece&s;&s;ary journies. And is it a tri|vial advantage, that all the&s;e unhappy circum&s;tances can be prevented by inoculation? By inoculation numbers are &s;aved from deformity as well as from death. In the na|tural &s;mall-pox, how often are the fine&s;t features, and the mo&s;t beautiful complexions, mi&s;erably disfigured? Where|as inoculation rarely leaves any ugly marks or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ears, even where the number of pu&s;tules on the face have been very con&s;iderable, and the &s;ymptoms by no means favourable. And many other grievous complaints, that are frequently &s;ub&s;equent to the natural &s;ort, &s;eldom follow the artificial. Does not inoculation al&s;o prevent tho&s;e inexpre&s;&s;ible ter|rors that perpetually harra&s;s per&s;ons who never had this di&s;|ea&s;e, in&s;omuch, that when the &s;mall-pox is epidemical, in|tire villages are depopulated, markets ruined, and the face of di&s;tre&s;s &s;pread over the whole country? From this terror it ari&s;es, that ju&s;tice is frequently po&s;tponed, or di&s;|couraged, at &s;e&s;&s;ions or a&s;&s;izes, where the &s;mall-pox ra|ges. Witne&s;&s;es and juries dare not appear; and, by rea|&s;on of the nece&s;&s;ary ab&s;ence of &s;ome gentlemen, our ho|nourable and u&s;eful judges are not attended with that reve|rence and &s;plendor due to their office and merit. Does not inoculation, in like manner, prevent our brave &s;ailors from
<PB N="163" REF="012338_0167_0F88E9FD2C17DB68">
being &s;eized with this di&s;temper on &s;hipboard, where they mu&s;t quickly &s;pread the infection among &s;uch of the crew who never had it before, and where they have &s;carce any chance to e&s;cape, being half-&s;tifled with the clo&s;ene&s;s of their cabbins, and but very indifferently nur&s;ed? La&s;tly, with regard to the &s;oldiery, the mi&s;eries attending the&s;e poor creatures, when attacked by the &s;mall-pox on a march, is inconceivable, without attendance, without lodgings, without an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> accommodations; &s;o that one of three commonly peri&s;hes."</P>
<P>WE &s;hall only add, that &s;uch as have not had the &s;mall-pox in the early period of life, are not only rendered un|happy, but likewi&s;e, in a great mea&s;ure, unfit for &s;u&s;tain|ing many of the mo&s;t u&s;eful and important offices. Few people would choo&s;e even to hire a &s;ervant who have not had the &s;mall-pox, far le&s;s to purcha&s;e a &s;lave who had the chance of dying with this di&s;ea&s;e. How could a phy&s;ician, or a &s;urgeon, who had never had the &s;mall-pox him&s;elf, attend others under that malady? Thus, be&s;ides, the continual fears and anxiety which haunt tho&s;e per&s;ons who have not had the &s;mall-pox, we might &s;hew numberle&s;s in|conveniencies which ari&s;e from it. For example,</P>
<P>HOW deplorable is the &s;ituation of females, who arrive at mature age without having had the &s;mall-pox! A wo|man with child &s;eldom &s;urvives this di&s;ea&s;e: And, if an infant happens to be &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox upon the mother's brea&s;t, who has not had the di&s;ea&s;e her&s;elf, the &s;cene mu&s;t be di&s;tre&s;&s;ing! If &s;he continues to &s;uckle the child, it is at the peril of her own life; and, if &s;he weans it, in all probability, it will peri&s;h. How often is the af|fectionate mother forced to leave her hou&s;e, and abandon her children, at the very time when her care is mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary? But &s;hould parental affection get the better of her fears, the con&s;equences will often prove fatal. I have known the tender mother and her in&s;ant child laid in the &s;ame grave, both untimely victims to this dreadful malady. But the&s;e are &s;cenes too &s;hocking even to mention. Let parents who run away with their children to avoid the &s;mall-pox, or who refu&s;e to inoculate them in their infan|cy, con&s;ider to what deplorable &s;ituations they may be re|duced by this mi&s;taken tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>AS the &s;mall-pox has now become a con&s;titutional di&s;|ea&s;e in mo&s;t parts of the known world, no other choice re|mains, but to render the malady as mild as po&s;&s;ible; that
<PB N="164" REF="012338_0168_0F88E9FFD0AA3858">
is the only manner of extirpation now left in our power; and, though it may &s;eem paradoxical, this artificial method of planting the di&s;ea&s;e, could it be rendered univer&s;al, would amount to nearly the &s;ame thing as rooting it out. It is a matter of &s;mall con&s;equence, whether a di&s;ea&s;e be entirely extirpated, or rendered &s;o mild, as neither to de|&s;troy life, nor hurt the con&s;titution; but that this may be done by inoculation, does not now admit of a doubt. The numbers who die under inoculation, hardly de&s;erve to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e named. In the natural way, one in four or five generally die; but by inoculation, not one of a thou&s;and. Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;ome can boa&s;t of having inoculated ten thou&s;and without the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle patient.</P>
<P>I have often wi&s;hed to &s;ee &s;ome plan e&s;tabli&s;hed for ren|dering this &s;alutary practice univer&s;al; but am afraid I &s;hall never be &s;o happy. The difficulties indeed are many; yet the thing is by no means impracticable. The aim is great; no le&s;s than &s;aving the lives of one fourth of man|kind. What ought not to be attempted in order to accom|pli&s;h &s;uch an end?</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;tep towards rendering the practice univer&s;al, mu&s;t be to remove the religious prejudices again&s;t it. This, as already ob&s;erved, can only be done by the clergy. They mu&s;t not only recommend it as a duty to others, but likewi&s;e practi&s;e it on their own children. Example will ever have more influence than precept.</P>
<P>THE next thing requi&s;ite is to put it in the power of all. For this purpo&s;e we would recommend it to the Faculty to inoculate the children of the poor <HI>gratis.</HI> It is hard that tho&s;e who are certainly the mo&s;t u&s;eful part of mankind, &s;hould, by their poverty, be excluded from &s;uch a bene|fit.</P>
<P>SHOULD this fail, it is &s;urely in the power of any &s;tate to render the practice general, at lea&s;t, as far as their do|minion extends. We do not mean, that it ought to be in|forced by a law: That, there is rea&s;on to believe, would rather tend to ob&s;truct its progre&s;s. The way to promote it, would be to employ a &s;ufficient number of operators at the public expence to inoculate the children of the poor. This would only be nece&s;&s;ary, till the practice became general; afterwards cu&s;tom, the &s;tronge&s;t of all laws, would oblige every one to inoculate their children, to prevent reflecti|ons.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="012338_0169_0F88EA016F186D50">
IT may be objected to this &s;cheme, that the poor would refu&s;e to employ the inoculators: That is ea&s;ily removed. A &s;mall premium to enable mothers to attend their chil|dren while under the di&s;ea&s;e, would be a &s;ufficient induce|ment; be&s;ides, the &s;ucce&s;s attending the operation, would &s;oon bani&s;h all objections to it. Even con&s;iderations of profit, would induce the poor to embrace this plan. They often bring up their children to the age of ten or twelve, and when they come to be u&s;eful, they are &s;natched away by this malady, to the great lo&s;s of their parents, and de|triment of the public.</P>
<P>THE Briti&s;h legi&s;lature has, of late years, &s;hown great attention to the pre&s;ervation of infant lives, by &s;upporting the foundling ho&s;pital, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But we will venture to &s;ay, if one tenth part of the &s;ums laid out in &s;upporting that in|&s;titution, had been be&s;towed towards promoting the prac|tice of inoculation of the &s;mall-pox among the poor, that not only more u&s;eful lives had been &s;aved, but the practice, before now, rendered quite univer&s;al in this i&s;land. It is not to be imagined, what effect example, and a little mo|ney, will have upon the poor; yet, if left to them&s;elves, they will go on for ever in the old way, without thinking of any improvement. We only mean this as a hint to the humane and public &s;pirited. Should &s;uch a &s;cheme be ever put in practice, a proper plan might ea&s;ily be laid down for the execution of it.</P>
<P>AS all public plans are very difficult to bring about, and, often, by the &s;elfi&s;h views, or mi&s;conduct, of tho&s;e intru&s;t|ed with the execution of them, fail of an&s;wering the noble purpo&s;es for which they were de&s;igned: We &s;hall, there|fore, point out &s;ome other methods by which the benefits of inoculation may be extended to the poor.</P>
<P>THERE is no doubt but inoculators will be daily more numerous. We would, therefore, have every pari&s;h in Britain, to allow one of them a &s;mall annual &s;alary for inoculating all the children of the pari&s;h at a proper age. Though &s;ome refractory per&s;ons might for a while object to this method, they would &s;oon be obliged to comply with it, or run the hazard of being reckoned the murder|ers of their own children.</P>
<P>TWO things chiefly operate to prevent the progre&s;s of inoculation. The one is a wi&s;h to put the evil day as far off as po&s;&s;ible. This is a principle in our nature; and as inoculation &s;eems rather to be anticipating a future evil,
<PB N="166" REF="012338_0170_0F88EA03125B91D8">
it is no wonder mankind are &s;o aver&s;e from it. But this objection is &s;ufficiently an&s;wered by the &s;ucce&s;s. Who, in his &s;en&s;es, would not prefer a le&s;&s;er evil to-day, to a greater to-morrow, provided it were equally certain?</P>
<P>THE other ob&s;tacle is the fear of reflections. This has very great weight with the bulk of mankind. Should the child die, they think the world would look down upon them. This they cannot bear. Here lies the difficulty which pinches, and till that be removed, inoculation will make but &s;mall progre&s;s. Nothing can remove it but cu&s;tom. Make the practice fa&s;hionable, and all the ob|jections at once vani&s;h. It is fa&s;hion alone that has led the multitude &s;ince the beginning of the world, and will lead them to the end. We mu&s;t, therefore, call upon the more enlightened part of mankind, to &s;et a pattern to the re&s;t. Their example, though it may, for &s;ome time, meet with oppo&s;ition, mu&s;t, at length, infallibly prevail.</P>
<P>I am aware of an objection to this practice, from the expence with which it may be attended; this is ea&s;ily ob|viated. We do not mean that every pari&s;h ought to employ a Sutton, or a Dim&s;dale, as inoculators. The&s;e have, by their &s;ucce&s;s, already recommended them&s;elves to crowned heads, and are beyond the vulgar reach; but have not others an equal chance to &s;ucceed? They certain|ly have. Let them make the &s;ame trial, and the difficulties will &s;oon vani&s;h. There is not a pari&s;h, and hardly a vil|lage in Britain, de&s;titute of &s;ome per&s;on who can bleed. But this is a far more difficult operation, and requires both more &s;kill and time than inoculation.</P>
<P>THE per&s;ons to whom we would chiefly recommend the performance of this operation are the clergy. Mo&s;t of them know &s;omething of medicine. Almo&s;t all of them bleed, and can order a purge; which are all the qualifica|tions nece&s;&s;ary for the practice of inoculation. The prie&s;ts among the le&s;s enlightened Indians perform this office; and why &s;hould a Chri&s;tian teacher think him&s;elf above it? Surely the bodies of men, as well as their &s;ouls, merit a part of the pa&s;tor's care; at lea&s;t, the greate&s;t Teacher who ever appeared among men &s;eems to have thought &s;o.</P>
<P>SHOULD all other methods fail, we would recommend it to parents to perform the operation them&s;elves. Let them take any method of communicating the di&s;ea&s;e they plea&s;e, provided the &s;ubject be healthy, and of a proper age; and we may venture to warrant their &s;ucce&s;s. I have known
<PB N="167" REF="012338_0171_0F88EA03B2722F40">
many in&s;tances of parents performing the operation, and never &s;o much as heard of one bad con&s;equence. A plant|er in one of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands is &s;aid to have inocula|ted, with his own hand, in one year, three hundred of his &s;laves, who, notwith&s;tanding the warmth of the climate, and other unfavourable circum&s;tances, all did well. Common mechanics have often, to my knowledge, performed the ope|ration with as good &s;ucce&s;s as phy&s;icians. We do not, how|ever, mean to di&s;courage tho&s;e, who have it in their power, from employing people of &s;kill to inoculate their children, and attend them while under the di&s;ea&s;e, but only to &s;hew, that where &s;uch cannot be had, the operation ought not, upon that account, to be neglected.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of multiplying arguments to this effect, I &s;hall ju&s;t beg leave to mention the method I took with my own child, an only &s;on. After giving him two gentle purges, I ordered the nur&s;e to take a bit of thread, which had been previou&s;ly wet with fre&s;h matter from a pock, and to lay it upon his arm, covering it with a piece of &s;ticking pla&s;ter. This &s;taid on &s;ix or &s;even days, till it was rubbed off by accident. At the u&s;ual time, the &s;mall-pox made their ap|pearance, and were exceedingly favourable. Sure this, which is all that is nece&s;&s;ary, may be done without any &s;kill in medicine.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the year for inoculation, is towards the end of the &s;pring, and in the beginning of &s;ummer. It may, however, be done at any time of the year, if circum|&s;tances render it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t proper age for inoculation is betwixt two and five. Many di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances attend inoculating children upon the brea&s;t, which we have not time to enu|merate. Neither &s;hould the operation be too long delayed. When the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ibres begin to grow rigid, and children make u&s;e of gro&s;&s;er food, the &s;mall-pox become more danger|ous.</P>
<P>CHILDREN, who have con&s;titutional di&s;ea&s;es, mu&s;t, ne|verthele&s;s, be inoculated. It will often mend the habit of body; but ought to be performed at a time when they are mo&s;t healthy. Accidental di&s;ea&s;es &s;hould always be re|moved before inoculation.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t healthy &s;tate is always to be cho&s;en, as that mu&s;t be the be&s;t preparation. The next &s;tep is to regulate the diet for &s;ometime before the di&s;ea&s;e is communicated. In children great alteration in diet is &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary, their food being
<PB N="168" REF="012338_0172_0F88EA03F8F519B8">
commonly of the the mo&s;t &s;imple and whole&s;ome kind; as milk, water pap, &s;mall broths, bread, light pudding, mild roots, and white meats.</P>
<P>CHILDREN, however, who have been accu&s;tomed to a hotter diet, who are of a gro&s;s habit, or abound with bad humours, ought to be put upon a &s;pare diet, before they be inoculated. Their food &s;hould be of a light cooling nature; and, their drink, whey, butter-milk, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>WE would recommend no other medicinal preparation, but two or three mild purges, which ought to be &s;uited to the age and &s;trength of the patient. It is, no doubt, po&s;&s;i|ble, by purgative and mercurial medicines, to le&s;&s;en the eruption; but it very &s;eldom happens, that the eruption, in this way, proves too great, and, we have always ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e children who had a pretty free eruption, and where the pox filled well, enjoyed the be&s;t health after|wards.</P>
<P>THE regimen, during the di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t be the &s;ame as under the natural &s;mall-pox.

<HEAD>OF THE MEASLES.</HEAD>
<P>THE mea&s;les appeared about the &s;ame time with the &s;mall-pox, and are nearly related to that di&s;ea&s;e. They both came from the Ea&s;t, are both infectious, and &s;eldom attack people more than once. The mea&s;les are mo&s;t com|mon in the &s;pring &s;ea&s;on, and generally di&s;appear in the &s;ummer. The di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf, when properly managed, is &s;eldom dangerous; but its con&s;equences are often fatal.</P>
<P>CAUSE.&mdash;This di&s;ea&s;e, like the &s;mall-pox, proceeds from infection, and is more or le&s;s dangerous, ac|cording to the con&s;titution of the patient, the &s;ea&s;on of the year, the climate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;The mea&s;les, like other fevers, are preceded by alternate fits of heat and cold, &s;ick|ne&s;s, and lo&s;s of appetite. The tongue is white, but ge|nerally moi&s;t. There is a &s;hort cough, a heavine&s;s of the
<PB N="169" REF="012338_0173_0F88EA04B9F27130">
head and eyes, drow&s;ine&s;s, and running of the no&s;e. Sometimes, indeed, the cough does not come before the eruption. The eye-lids frequently &s;well &s;o as to occa&s;ion blindne&s;s. The patient generally complains of his throat; and vomiting or loo&s;ene&s;s often precedes the eruption. The &s;tools in children are commonly greeni&s;h; they complain of an itching of the &s;kin, and are remarkably peevi&s;h. Bleeding at the no&s;e is common, both before and in the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>ABOUT the fourth day, &s;mall &s;pots, re&s;embling flea|bites, appear, fir&s;t upon the face, then upon the brea&s;t, and, afterwards, on the extremities: The&s;e may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the &s;mall-pox, by their &s;carcely ri&s;ing above the &s;kin. The fever, cough, and difficulty of breathing, in&s;tead of being removed by the eruption, as in the &s;mall|pox, are rather increa&s;ed; but the vomiting generally cea&s;es.</P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;ixth day, the mea&s;les begin to grow dry on the face, and, afterwards, upon the body; &s;o that by the ninth day they entirely di&s;appear. The fever, however, and difficulty of breathing, often continue, e&s;pecially if the patient has been kept upon too hot a regimen. Petechiae, or purple &s;pots, may likewi&s;e be occa&s;ioned by this error.</P>
<P>A violent loo&s;ene&s;s &s;ometimes &s;ucceeds the mea&s;les, in which ca&s;e the patient's life is in imminent danger.</P>
<P>SUCH as die of the mea&s;les generally expire about the ninth day, and are evidently carried off by a peripneumony, or inflammation of the lungs.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t favourable &s;ymptoms are, a moderate loo&s;ene&s;s, gentle &s;weats, and a plentiful di&s;charge of urine.</P>
<P>WHEN the eruption &s;uddenly falls in, and the patient is &s;eized with a delirium, he is in the greate&s;t danger. If the mea&s;les turn of a pale colour, it is an unfavourable &s;ymp|tom, as are al&s;o, great weakne&s;s, vomiting, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and difficulty of &s;wallowing. Purple, or black &s;pots, ap|pearing among the mea&s;les, are very unfavourable. When a continual cough, with hoar&s;ene&s;s, &s;ucceeds the di&s;ea&s;e, there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect an approaching con&s;umption of the lungs.</P>
<P>OUR bu&s;ine&s;s in this di&s;ea&s;e is to a&s;&s;i&s;t nature, if her ef|forts be too languid, in throwing out the morbid matter, by proper cordials; but when they are too violent, they mu&s;t be re&s;trained by evacuations, and cool diluting liquors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We ought, likewi&s;e, to endeavour to appea&s;e the
<PB N="170" REF="012338_0174_0F88EA0570758C50">
mo&s;t urgent &s;ymptoms, as the cough, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and dif|ficulty of breathing.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;The regimen in this di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould be of the &s;ame kind with that recommended in the &s;mall-pox, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> cooling and diluting. Acids, however, do not an&s;wer &s;o well here as in the &s;mall-pox, as they tend to exa&s;perate the cough. Small beer, likewi&s;e, though a good drink in the &s;mall-pox, is here improper. The mo&s;t &s;uitable liquors are decoctions of liquorice, with mar&s;h-mallow roots, and &s;ar&s;aparilla; infu&s;ions of lin&s;eed, or of the flowers of elder with milk, clarified whey, barley water, and &s;uch like. The&s;e, if the belly be bound, may be &s;weetened with honey; or, if that &s;hould di&s;agree with the &s;tomach, a little manna may occa&s;ionally be added to them.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;The mea&s;les being an in|flammatory di&s;ea&s;e, without any critical di&s;charge of mat|ter, as in the &s;mall-pox, bleeding is commonly nece&s;&s;ary, e&s;pecially when the fever runs high, with difficulty of breathing, and great oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t. But if the di&s;ea&s;e be of a mild kind, bleeding may be omitted.</P>
<P>BATHING the feet and legs in lukewarm water, both tends to abate the violence of the fever, and to promote the eruption.</P>
<P>THE patient is often greatly relieved by vomiting. When there is a tendency this way, it ought not to be &s;top|ped, but encouraged, by drinking lukewarm water, or weak camomile tea.</P>
<P>WHEN the cough is very trouble&s;ome, with dryne&s;s of the throat, and difficulty of breathing, it will greatly re|lieve the patient, if he holds his head over the &s;team of warm water, and draws the &s;team into his lungs.</P>
<P>HE may likewi&s;e lick a little &s;permaceti and &s;ugar-can|dy pounded together; or take now and then a &s;poonful of the oil of &s;weet-almonds, with &s;ugar-candy di&s;&s;olved in it. The&s;e will &s;often the throat, and relieve the tickling cough.</P>
<P>IN ca&s;e the mea&s;les &s;hould &s;uddenly di&s;appear, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue the &s;ame method which we have recom|mended when the &s;mall-pox fall in. The patient mu&s;t be &s;upported with wine and cordials. Bli&s;tering pla&s;ters mu&s;t be applied to the extremities, and the body rubbed all over with warm flannels. Warm poultices may, likewi&s;e, be applied to the feet, and palms of the hands.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="012338_0175_0F88EA0637646F68">
WHEN purple, or black &s;pots appear, the patient's drink &s;hould be &s;harpened with &s;pirits of vitriol; and, if the putrid &s;ymptoms run high, the Je&s;uits bark mu&s;t be admini&s;tered in the &s;ame manner as directed in the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>OPIATES are &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary, but &s;hould never be given except in ca&s;e of extreme re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, a violent loo&s;e|ne&s;s, or when the cough is very trouble&s;ome. For chil|dren, the &s;yrup of poppies is &s;ufficient. A tea &s;poonful or two may be occa&s;ionally given, according to the patient's age, or the violence of the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>AFTER the mea&s;les are gone off, purging is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary. This may be conducted in the &s;ame manner as directed in the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>IF a violent loo&s;ene&s;s &s;ucceeds the mea&s;les, it may be checked by taking, for &s;ome days, a gentle do&s;e of rhubarb in the morning, and an opiate over night; but, if the&s;e do not remove it, bleeding will &s;eldom fail to have that effect.</P>
<P>PATIENTS recovering after the mea&s;les, &s;hould be very careful what they eat or drink. Their food, for &s;ome time, &s;hould be light, and in &s;mall quantities, and their drink diluting, and rather of an opening nature; as butter|milk, whey, and &s;uch like. They ought, al&s;o, to be|ware of expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the cold air, le&s;t a &s;uffoca|ting catarrh, an a&s;thma, or a con&s;umption of the lungs &s;hould en&s;ue.</P>
<P>SHOULD a cough, with difficulty of breathing, and other &s;ymptoms of a con&s;umption, remain after the mea&s;les, we would recommend &s;mall quantities of blood to be fre|quently let at proper intervals, as the patient's &s;trength and con&s;titution will bear. He ought, likewi&s;e, to drink a&s;&s;es milk, to remove to a free air, if nece&s;&s;ary, and to ride daily on hor&s;eback. He mu&s;t keep clo&s;e to a diet, con|&s;i&s;ting of milk and vegetables; and, la&s;tly, if the&s;e do not &s;ucceed, let him remove to a warmer climate.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE SCARLET FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;carlet fever is &s;o called from the colour of the pa|tient's &s;kin, which appears as if it were tinged with red wine. It happens at any &s;ea&s;on of the year, but is mo&s;t common in the latter end of &s;ummer; at which time it of|ten &s;eizes whole families, e&s;pecially children.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="012338_0176_0F88EA06F8DC3A88">
IT begins with coldne&s;s and &s;hivering, as in other fevers, without any violent &s;ickne&s;s. Afterwards the &s;kin is covered with red &s;pots, which are broader, more florid, and le&s;s uni|form than the mea&s;les. They continue two or three days, and then di&s;appear; after which the cuticle, or &s;carf-&s;kin, falls off.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;eldom any occa&s;ion for medicine in this di&s;|ea&s;e.

<HEAD>OF THE ERYSIPELAS, OR ST. ANTHONY's FIRE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e, which in many parts of Britain is called <HI>the ro&s;e,</HI> attack per&s;ons at all periods of life, but is mo&s;t common between the age of thirty and forty. Per&s;ons of a &s;anguine or plethoric habit, are mo&s;t liable to it. It often attacks young people, and pregnant women; and &s;uch as have once been afflicted with it, are very liable to have it again. Sometimes it is a primary di&s;ea&s;e, and, at other times only a &s;ymptom of &s;ome other malady. Every part of the body is liable to be attacked by an ery&s;ipelas, but it mo&s;t frequently &s;eizes the legs or face, e&s;pecially the latter. It prevails mo&s;t in autumn, or when hot weather is &s;ucceed|ed by cold and wet.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;The eri&s;ipelas is frequently occa|&s;ioned by violent pa&s;&s;ions or affections of the mind; as, fear, anger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is likewi&s;e occa&s;ioned by cold. When the body has been heated to a great degree, and is immediately expo&s;ed to the cold air, &s;o that the per&s;piration is &s;uddenly checked, an ery&s;ipelas will often en&s;ue. It
<PB N="173" REF="012338_0177_0F88EA07AC5E46C0">
may al&s;o be occa&s;ioned by exce&s;s of &s;trong liquor, by con|tinuing too long in a warm bath, or by any thing that over|heats the blood. If any of the natural evacuations be ob|&s;tructed, or in too &s;mall a quantity, it may cau&s;e an ery|&s;ipelas. The &s;ame effect will follow from a &s;toppage of ar|tificial evacuations; as, i&s;&s;ues, &s;etons or the like.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;The ery&s;ipelas attacks with a violent &s;haking, heat, thir&s;t, lo&s;s of &s;trength, pain in the head and back, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and a quick pul&s;e; to which may be added, vomiting, and &s;ometimes a delirium. On the &s;econd, third, or fourth day, the part &s;wells, be|comes red, and &s;mall pu&s;tules appear; at which time the fever generally abates.</P>
<P>WHEN the ery&s;ipelas &s;eizes the foot, the parts contiguous &s;well, the &s;kin &s;hines; and, if the pain be violent, it will a&s;cend to the leg, and will not bear to be touched.</P>
<P>WHEN it attacks the face, it &s;wells, appears red, and the &s;kin is covered with &s;mall pu&s;tules, filled with clear water. One or both eyes are generally clo&s;ed with the &s;welling; and there is a difficulty of breathing. If the mouth or no&s;trils be very dry, and the patient drow&s;y, there is rea&s;on to expect an inflammation of the brain.</P>
<P>IF the ery&s;ipelas effects the brea&s;t, it &s;wells, and becomes exceedingly hard, with great pain, and is apt to &s;uppurate.</P>
<P>THERE is a violent pain in the armpit on the &s;ide affected, where an ab&s;ce&s;s is often formed.</P>
<P>THERE is a kind of ery&s;ipelas, which in &s;ome parts of Britain goes by the name of the <HI>ring worm.</HI> It frequently attacks children about the region of the navel, where it &s;urrounds the body like a girdle, and is not without dan|ger.</P>
<P>THE event of this di&s;ea&s;e depends greatly upon the con|&s;titution of the patient. It is &s;eldom dangerous; yet I have known it prove fatal to people in the decline of life, who were of a &s;corbutic habit, or who&s;e humours were vitiated by irregular living, or unwhole&s;ome diet.</P>
<P>IF, in a day or two, the &s;welling &s;ub&s;ides, the heat and pain cea&s;e, the ro&s;y colour turns yellow, and the cuticle breaks and falls off in &s;cales, the danger is over.</P>
<P>WHEN the ery&s;ipel as is large, deep, and affects a very &s;en&s;ible part of the body, the danger is great. If the red colour changes into black or blue, it will end in a mortifi|cation. Sometimes the inflammation cannot be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, but comes to &s;uppuration; in which ca&s;e, &s;i&s;tulas, a gan|grene,
<PB N="174" REF="012338_0178_0F88EA09D31BB558">

or mortification, generally en&s;ue. Where the con|&s;titution was bad, I have frequently &s;een the leg &s;well to a prodigious &s;ize, and the cure prove extremely difficult.</P>
<P>SUCH as die of this di&s;ea&s;e, are mo&s;tly carried off by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ever, which is attended with difficulty of breathing, &s;ome|times with a delirium, and great drow&s;ine&s;s. They gene|rally die about the &s;eventh or eighth day.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;In this di&s;ea&s;e the patient mu&s;t neither be kept too hot nor cold, as either of the&s;e extremes will tend to make the di&s;ea&s;e retreat, which is always to be guarded again&s;t. When the di&s;ea&s;e is mild, it will be &s;uffi|cient to keep the patient within doors, without confining him to his bed, and to promote the per&s;piration by diluting liquors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE diet ought to be very &s;pare, and of a moderately cool|ing and moi&s;tening quality; as groat gruel, panada, &s;mall chicken or barley broth, with cooling herbs and fruits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> avoiding fle&s;h, fi&s;h, &s;trong drink, &s;pices, pickles, and all other things that may heat and inflame the blood; the drink may be barley water, an infu&s;ion of elder flowers, common whey, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>BUT if the pul&s;e be low, and the &s;pirits &s;unk, the patient mu&s;t be &s;upported with &s;mall negas and other things of a cor|dial nature. His food may be &s;ago gruel with a little wine, and nouri&s;hing broths, taken in &s;mall quantities, and often re|peated. Great care, however, mu&s;t be had not to over|heat him.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;In this di&s;ea&s;e much mi&s;chief is often done by medicine, e&s;pecially external applications. People, when they &s;ee an inflammation, immediately think of &s;ome external applications. The&s;e, indeed, are nece&s;&s;a|ry in large phlegmons; but, in an ery&s;ipelas, the &s;afer cour&s;e is to apply nothing. Almo&s;t all ointments, &s;alves and pla&s;ters, are of a grea&s;y nature, and tend rather to ob|&s;truct and repel, than promote any di&s;charge from the part. At the beginning of this di&s;ea&s;e, it is neither &s;afe to pro|mote a &s;uppuration, nor to repel the matter too quickly. The ery&s;ipelas, in many re&s;pects, re&s;embles the gout, and is to be treated with the greate&s;t caution. Fine wool, or very &s;oft flannel, are the &s;afe&s;t applications to the part. The&s;e not only defend it from the external air, but likewi&s;e promote the per&s;piration, which has a great tendency to carry off the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="012338_0179_0F88EA0B661874E8">
IT is a common thing to bleed in the ery&s;ipelas; but this likewi&s;e requires caution. If, however, the fever be high, the pul&s;e hard and &s;trong, and the patient vigorous, it will be proper to bleed; but the quantity mu&s;t be regulated by the&s;e circum&s;tances, and the operation repeated or not, as the &s;ymptoms may require. If the patient has been accu|&s;tomed to &s;trong liquors, and the di&s;ea&s;e attacks his head, bleeding is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>BATHING the feet and legs frequently in lukewarm water, when the di&s;ea&s;e attacks the face or brain, has an excellent effect. It tends to draw the humours of the head towards the inferior extremities, and &s;eldom fails to relieve the pati|ent. When bathing proves ineffectual, poultices, or &s;harp &s;inapi&s;ms, may be applied to the &s;oles of the feet for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IN ca&s;es where bleeding is requi&s;ite, it is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;a|ry to keep the belly gently open. This may be effected by emollient cly&s;ters, or &s;mall do&s;es of nitre and rhubarb, &s;uch as are pre&s;cribed in the foregoing di&s;ea&s;e. Some, in|deed, recommend very large do&s;es of nitre in this ca&s;e; but nitre &s;eldom &s;its ea&s;y on the &s;tomach when taken in large quantities. It is, however, one of the be&s;t medicines in this ca&s;e; and, when the fever and inflammation run high, half a dram of it may be taken in the patient's ordinary drink, three or four times a-day.</P>
<P>THE &s;aline julep, as it is called, is likewi&s;e a very proper medicine in the ery&s;ipelatous fever. It may be made by di&s;&s;olving two drams of &s;alt of wormwood, or &s;alt of tartar, in three ounces of fre&s;h lemon juice, to which may be add|ed, two ounces of common water, and an ounce or two of peppermint water, with as much white &s;ugar as will render it agreeable. Of this two table &s;poonfuls may be taken every two or three hours.</P>
<P>WHEN the ery&s;ipelas leaves the extremities, and &s;eizes the head, &s;o as to occa&s;ion a delirium, or &s;tupor, it is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to open the belly. If cly&s;ters and mild purgatives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ail to have that effect, &s;tronger ones mu&s;t be given. Bli&s;tering pla&s;ters mu&s;t, likewi&s;e, be applied to the neck, or behind the ears, and &s;harp catapla&s;ms laid to the &s;oles of the feet.</P>
<P>WHEN the ery&s;ipelas cannot be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and the pain lies deep, and &s;eems to reach to the membrane which co|vers the bones, and the part has a tendency to ulcerate, it will then be proper to promote &s;uppuration, which may
<PB N="176" REF="012338_0180_0F88EA0B79390C40">
be done by the application of ripening poultices, with &s;af|fron, warm fomentations, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>WHEN the black, livid, or blue colour of the part, &s;hews a tendency to mortification, the Je&s;uits bark mu&s;t be admini&s;tered. It may be taken along with acids, as re|commended in the &s;mall-pox, or in any other form more agreeable to the patient. It mu&s;t not, however, be trifled with, as the patient's life is at &s;take. Half a dram may be taken every two hours, or oftener, if the &s;ymptoms be threatening, and cloths dipped in warm camphorated &s;pi|rits of wine, or the tincture of myrrh and aloes, may be applied to the part, and frequently renewed.</P>
<P>IN what is commonly the &s;corbutic ery&s;ipelas, which continues for a con&s;iderable time, it will only be nece&s;&s;ary to give gentle laxatives, and &s;uch things as purify the blood. Medicines which promote the per&s;piration are likewi&s;e proper. Thus, after the inflammation has been checked by opening medicines, a decoction of the &s;udorific woods, as &s;a&s;&s;afras and guaiacum, with liquorice root, may be drank, and afterwards a cour&s;e of bitters, which will both &s;trengthen the &s;tomach, and purify the blood.</P>
<P>SUCH as are liable to frequent attacks of the ery&s;ipelas, ought carefully to guard again&s;t all violent pa&s;&s;ions; to ab|&s;tain from &s;trong liquors, and all fat, vi&s;cid, and highly nouri&s;hing food. They &s;hould take abundance of exerci&s;e, carefully avoiding the extremes of heat or cold. Their food &s;hould con&s;i&s;t chiefly of milk, and &s;uch fruits, herbs, and roots, as are of a cooling quality; and their drink ought to be &s;mall beer, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, butter-milk, and &s;uch like. They &s;hould never &s;uffer them&s;elves to be too long co&s;tive. If that cannot be prevented by diet alone, it will be proper to take frequently a gentle do&s;e of rhubarb and cream of tartar, the lenitive electuary, or &s;ome other mild purga|tive.</P>

When repellents are imprudently u&s;ed in an ery&s;ipelas, an inflammation of the brain is often the con&s;e|quence. It may, likewi&s;e, be occa&s;ioned by external in|juries, as blows, or brui&s;es upon the head, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;The &s;ymptoms which precede a true inflammation of the brain are, pain of the head, redne&s;s of the eyes, a violent flu&s;hing of the face, di&s;turb|ed &s;leep, or a total want of it, great dryne&s;s of the &s;kin, co&s;tivene&s;s, a retention of urine, a &s;mall dropping of blood from the no&s;e, &s;inging of the ears, and extreme &s;en&s;ibility of the nervous &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>WHEN the inflammation is formed, the &s;ymptoms, in general are &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the inflammatory fever. The pul&s;e, indeed, is often weak, irregular, and trembling; but, &s;ometimes, it is hard and contracted. When the brain it&s;elf is inflamed, the pul&s;e is always &s;oft and low; but when the inflammation only affects the integuments of the brain, it is hard. A remarkable quickne&s;s of hearing, is a com|mon &s;ymptom of this di&s;ea&s;e; but that &s;eldom continues long. Another u&s;ual &s;ymptom is, a great throbbing or pul|&s;ation in the arteries of the neck and temples. The tongue is often black and dry; yet the patient &s;eldom complains of thir&s;t, and even refu&s;es drink. The mind chiefly runs after &s;uch objects as have before made a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon it; and, &s;ometimes, from a &s;ullen &s;ilence, the patient be|comes all of a &s;udden quite outrageous.</P>
<P>A con&s;tant trembling and &s;tarting of the tendons, is an unfavourable &s;ymptom, as al&s;o, a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the urine; a total want of &s;leep; a con&s;tant &s;pitting; a grinding of the teeth, which mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a kind of convul&s;i|on. When this di&s;ea&s;e &s;ucceeds an inflammation of the lungs, of the inte&s;tines, or of the throat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is owing to a tran&s;lation of the morbific matter from the&s;e parts to the brain, and generally proves fatal. Hence we learn the nece&s;&s;ity of proper evacuations, and the danger of repellents in all inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="012338_0182_0F88EA0D061CE930">
THE favourable &s;ymptoms are, a free per&s;piration or &s;weating, a copious di&s;charge of blood from the no&s;e, the bleeding piles, a plentiful di&s;charge of urine, which lets fall a copious &s;ediment. Sometimes the di&s;ea&s;e is carried off by a loo&s;ene&s;s, and in women by an exce&s;&s;ive flow of the <HI>men&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>AS this di&s;ea&s;e often proves fatal in a few days, it re|quires the mo&s;t &s;peedy applications. When it is prolong|ed, or improperly treated, it &s;ometimes ends in madne&s;s, or a kind of &s;tupidity, which continues for life.</P>
<P>IN the cure, two things are chiefly to be attended to, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to le&s;&s;en the quantity of blood in the brain, and to re|tard the circulation towards the head.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;The patient ought to be kept very quiet. Company, noi&s;e, and every thing that affects the &s;en&s;es, or di&s;turbs the imagination, increa&s;es the di&s;ea&s;e. Even too much light is hurtful; for which rea&s;on, the pa|tient's chamber ought to be a little darkened, and he &s;hould neither be kept too hot nor cold. It is not, however, nece&s;&s;ary to exclude the company of an agreeable friend, as this has a tendency to &s;ooth and quiet the mind. Nei|ther &s;hould the patient be kept too much in the dark, le&s;t it &s;hould occa&s;ion a gloomy melancholy, which is too often the con&s;equence of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE patient mu&s;t, as far as po&s;&s;ible, be &s;oothed and hu|moured in every thing. Contradiction will ruffle his mind, and increa&s;e his malady. Even when he calls for things which are not to be obtained, or which might prove hurtful, he is not to be po&s;itively denied them, but rather put off with the promi&s;e of having them as &s;oon as they can be obtained, or by &s;ome other excu&s;e. A little of any thing that the mind is &s;et upon, though not quite proper, will hurt the patient le&s;s than a po&s;itive refu&s;al. In a word, whatever the patient is fond of, or u&s;ed to be delighted with when in health, may here be tried, as plea|&s;ing &s;tories, &s;oft mu&s;ic, or whatever has a tendency to &s;ooth the pa&s;&s;ions, and compo&s;e the mind. Boerhaave pro|po&s;es &s;everal mechanical experiments for this purpo&s;e; as the &s;oft noi&s;e of water di&s;tilling by drops into a ba&s;on, and the patient trying to reckon them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Any uniform &s;ound, if low and continued, has a tendency to procure &s;leep, and, con&s;equently, may be of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>THE aliment ought to be light, of farinaceous &s;ub&s;tances; as panado, and water gruel, &s;harpened with jelly of cur|rants
<PB N="179" REF="012338_0183_0F88EA0DB339FBB0">
or juice of lemons, ripe fruits roa&s;ted or boiled, jellies, pre&s;erves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The drink &s;mall, diluting, and cooling, as whey, barley water, or decoctions of barley and tamarinds; which latter, not only renders the liquor more palatable, but likewi&s;e more beneficial, as they are of an opening cooling nature.</P>
<P>MEDICINES.&mdash;In an inflammation of the brain, nothing more certainly relieves the patient than a free di&s;charge of blood from the no&s;e. When this comes of its own accord, it is by no means to be &s;topped, but promoted, by applying cloths dipped in warm water to the part. When bleeding at the no&s;e does not happen &s;ponta|neou&s;ly, it may be provoked by putting a &s;traw, or any other &s;harp body up the no&s;tril.</P>
<P>BLEEDING in the temporal arteries greatly relieves the head; but as this operation cannot be generally performed, we would recommend in its &s;tead bleeding in the jugular veins. When the patient's pul&s;e and &s;pirits are &s;o low, that he cannot bear bleeding with the lancet, leeches may be applied to the temples. The&s;e not only draw off the blood more gradually, but by being applied nearer to the part affected, generally give more immediate relief.</P>
<P>A di&s;charge of blood from the haemorrhoidal veins is like|wi&s;e of great &s;ervice, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, by all means, to be pro|moted. If the patient has been &s;ubject to the bleeding piles, and that di&s;charge has been &s;topped, every method mu&s;t be tried to re&s;tore it; as the application of leeches to the parts, &s;itting over the &s;teams of warm water, &s;harp cly|&s;ters, or &s;uppo&s;itories made of honey, aloes, and rock &s;alt.</P>
<P>IF the inflammation of the brain be occa&s;ioned by the &s;toppage of any evacuation, either natural or artificial, as the men&s;es, i&s;&s;ues, &s;etons, or &s;uch like, all means mu&s;t be u&s;ed to re&s;tore it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, or to &s;ub&s;titute &s;ome other in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>IF the patient be co&s;tive, his belly mu&s;t be kept open by emollient cly&s;ters, or gentle purgatives; as manna, rhu|barb, cream of tartar, or &s;uch like. The&s;e may either be given &s;eparately or together in &s;mall do&s;es, and repeated as there may be occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>SMALL quantities of nitre ought frequently to be mixed with the patient's drink. Two drams, or more, if the ca&s;e be dangerous, may be u&s;ed every twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>THE head &s;hould be &s;haven, and frequently rubbed with vinegar and ro&s;e water a little warm. Cloths dipped in it may likewi&s;e be applied to the temples.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="012338_0184_0F88EA0F67EFFBD8">
IF the di&s;ea&s;e proves ob&s;tinate, and does not yield to the&s;e medicines, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to apply a bli&s;tering pla&s;ter to the whole head.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE INFLAMMATION OF THE EYES.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e may be occa&s;ioned by external injuries; as &s;trokes, du&s;t thrown into the eyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is often cau&s;ed by the &s;toppage of cu&s;tomary evacuations; as the healing of old &s;ores, drying up of i&s;&s;ues, or the like. Nothing more certainly brings on an inflammation of the eyes, than the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of gentle morning &s;weats, or the &s;weating of the feet. Long expo&s;ure to the night air, e&s;pecially in cold northerly winds, or whatever &s;uddenly checks the per&s;piration, e&s;pecially after the body has been much heat|ed, is very apt to cau&s;e an inflammation of the eyes. View|ing &s;now or other white bodies for a long time, or looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at the &s;un, a clear fire, or any bright object, will likewi&s;e occa&s;ion this malady. A &s;udden tran&s;ition from darkne&s;s to very bright light, will often have the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>NOTHING more certainly occa&s;ions an inflammation of the eyes than night watching e&s;pecially reading or writing by candle light. Drinking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">itous liquors, and exce&s;s of venery, are very hurtful to the eyes. The acrid fumes of metals, and of &s;everal kinds of fuel, are likewi&s;e very perni|cious. Sometimes an inflammation of the eyes proceeds from a venereal taint, and often from a &s;crophulous or gouty habit. It may likewi&s;e be occa&s;ioned by hairs in the eye-lids turning inwards, and hurting the eyes. Sometimes the di&s;ea&s;e is epidemic, e&s;pecially after wet &s;ea&s;ons; and I have frequently known it prove infectious, particularly to tho&s;e who lived in the &s;ame hou&s;e with the patient. It may be occa&s;ioned by moi&s;t air, or living in low, damp hou&s;es, e&s;pecially where people are not accu&s;tomed to &s;uch &s;ituations. In children, it often proceeds from imprudent|ly drying up of &s;cabbed heads, a running behind the ears, or any other di&s;charge of the &s;ame nature<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Inflammations of the eyes often &s;ucceed the &s;mall-pox, or mea&s;les, e&s;pe|cially in children of a &s;crophulous habit.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;An inflammation of the eyes is attended with acute pain, heat, redne&s;s, and &s;welling. The patient is not able to bear the light, and &s;ometimes he feels a pricking pain, as if his eyes were pierced with a
<PB N="181" REF="012338_0185_0F88EA0FED5EF1C8">
thorn. Sometimes he imagines his eyes are full of motes, or thinks he &s;ees flies dancing before him, the eyes are fill|ed with a &s;calding rheum, which ru&s;hes forth in great quantities, whenever the patient attempts to look up. The pul&s;e is generally quick and hard, with &s;ome degree of fever. When the di&s;ea&s;e is violent, the neighbouring parts &s;well, and there is a throbbing or pul&s;ation in the temporal arteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>A &s;light inflammation of the eyes, e&s;pecially from an ex|ternal cau&s;e, is ea&s;ily cured; but when the di&s;ea&s;e is vio|lent, and continues long, it leaves &s;pecks upon the eyes, or dimne&s;s of &s;ight, and &s;ometimes total blindne&s;s.</P>
<P>IF the patient be &s;eized with a loo&s;ene&s;s, it has a good effect; and when the inflammation pa&s;&s;es from one eye to another, as it were by infection, it is no unfavourable &s;ymptom. When the di&s;ea&s;e is accompanied with a vio|lent pain of the head, and continues long, the patient is in great danger of lo&s;ing his &s;ight.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;The diet, unle&s;s in &s;crophulous ca&s;es, can hardly be too &s;pare, e&s;pecially at the beginning. The patient mu&s;t ab&s;tain from every thing of a heating na|ture. His food mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t chiefly of mild vegetables, weak broths, and gruels. His drink may be barley water, balm tea, common whey, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>THE patient's chamber mu&s;t be darkened, or his eyes &s;haded by a green cover, &s;o as to exclude the light, but not to pre&s;s upon the eyes. He &s;hould not look at a candle, the fire, or any luminous object; and ought to avoid all &s;moke, as the fumes of tobacco, or any thing that may cau&s;e cough|ing, &s;neezing, or vomiting. He &s;hould be kept quiet, avoid|ing all violent efforts, either of body or mind, and encou|raging &s;leep, as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;This is one of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es wherein great hurt is done by external applications. Al|mo&s;t every per&s;on pretends to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a remedy for the cure of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore eyes. The&s;e remedies generally con&s;i&s;t of eye-waters and ointments, with other external applications. All which do mi&s;chief twenty times for once they do good. People ought, therefore, to be very cautious how they u&s;e &s;uch things, as the very pre&s;&s;ure upon the eyes often increa|&s;es the malady.</P>
<P>BLEEDING, in a violent inflammation of the eyes, is al|ways nece&s;&s;ary. This &s;hould be performed as near the part affected as po&s;&s;ible. An adult may lo&s;e ten or twelve ounces
<PB N="182" REF="012338_0186_0F88EA11179F5530">
of blood from the jugular vein, and the operation may be re|peated according to the urgency of the &s;ymptoms. If it be not, however, convenient to bleed in the neck, the &s;ame quan|tity may be let from the arm, or any other part of the body.</P>
<P>LEECHES are often applied to the temples, or under the eyes with good effect. The wounds mu&s;t be &s;uffered to bleed for &s;ome hours, and if the bleeding &s;top &s;oon, it may be promoted by the application of cloths dipt in warm water. In ob&s;tinate ca&s;es, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to repeat this opera|tion &s;everal times.</P>
<P>OPENING and diluting medicines are by no means to be neglected. The patient may take a &s;mall do&s;e of Glau|ber's &s;alts and cream of tartar, every &s;econd or third day, or a decoction of tamarinds with &s;enna. If the&s;e be not agreeable, gentle do&s;es of rhubarb and nitre, a little of the lenitive electuary, or any other mild purgative, will an&s;wer the &s;ame end. The patient, at the &s;ame time, mu&s;t drink freely of water gruel, tea, or any other weak diluting li|quor. He ought likewi&s;e to take, at bed-time, a large draught of very weak wine whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, in order to promote per|&s;piration. His feet and legs mu&s;t frequently be bathed in lukewarm water, and his head &s;haved twice or thrice a-week, and afterwards wa&s;hed in cold water. This has a remarkable good effect.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e evacuations have been continued for &s;ome time, if the inflammation does not yield to them, bli&s;tering pla&s;ters mu&s;t be applied behind the ears, to the temples, or upon the neck, and kept open for &s;ome time by the mild bli&s;tering ointment. I never knew the&s;e, if long enough kept open, fail to remove the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate inflammation of the eyes; but, for this purpo&s;e it is often nece&s;&s;ary to con|tinue the di&s;charge for &s;everal weeks.</P>
<P>WHEN the di&s;ea&s;e has been of long &s;tanding, I have &s;een very extraordinary effects from a &s;eton in the neck, or be|twixt the &s;houlders, e&s;pecially the latter. It &s;hould be put upwards and downwards, or in the direction of the &s;pine, and in the middle between the &s;houlder-blades. It may be dre&s;&s;ed twice a-day with yellow ba&s;ilicon. I have known patients, who had been blind for &s;everal months, recover &s;ight by means of a &s;eton betwixt the &s;houlders. When the &s;eton is put a-cro&s;s the neck, it &s;oon wears out, and is both more painful and trouble&s;ome than between the &s;houlders; be&s;ides, it leaves a di&s;agreeable mark, and does not di&s;charge &s;o freely.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="012338_0187_0F88EA117826AA10">
WHEN the heat and pain of the eyes is very great, a &s;oft poultice of bread and milk, with plenty of &s;weet oil or fre&s;h butter, may be applied to them, at lea&s;t all night; and they may be bathed with lukewarm milk and water every morn|ing.</P>
<P>IF the patient cannot &s;leep, which is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, he mu&s;t take ten or twelve drops or laudanum, or two &s;poon|fuls of the &s;yrup of poppies, over night, more or le&s;s ac|cording to his age, or the violence of the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>AFTER the inflammation is gone off, if the eyes &s;till re|main weak and tender, they may be bathed every night and morning with cold water and a little brandy, &s;ix parts of the former to one of the latter. A method &s;hould be con|trived by which the eyes can be quite immer&s;ed in the bran|dy and water, where they &s;hould be kept for &s;ome minutes. I have generally &s;ound this as good a &s;trengthener of the eyes as any of the mo&s;t celebrated collyriums.</P>
<P>WHEN an inflammation of the eyes proceeds from a &s;cro|phulous habit, it generally proves very ob&s;tinate. In this ca&s;e the patient's diet mu&s;t not be too low, and he may be allowed to drink &s;mall negas, or now and then a gla&s;s of wine. The mo&s;t proper medicine is the Je&s;uits bark, which may either be given in &s;ub&s;tance, or prepared in the following manner:</P>
<P>TAKE an ounce of Je&s;uits bark in powder, with two drams of Winter's bark, and boil them in an Engli&s;h quart of water to a pint; when it has boiled nearly long enough, add half an ounce of liquorice root &s;liced. Let the liquor be &s;trained. Two, three, or four table &s;poonfuls, according to the age of the patient, may be taken three or four times a-day. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how long this me|dicine &s;hould be continued, as the cure is &s;ooner performed in &s;ome than others; but, in general, it requires a con&s;i|derable time to produce any la&s;ting effects.</P>
<P>DR. Cheyne &s;ays, "That aethiops mineral never fails in inflammations of the eyes, even &s;crophulous ones, if given in a &s;ufficient do&s;e, and per&s;i&s;ted in for a &s;ufficient time." Both this and other mercurial preparations, are no doubt proper when the di&s;ea&s;e proves ob&s;tinate; more e&s;pecially, when there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that it may proceed from a venereal taint; but as the&s;e medicines can never be &s;afely admini&s;tered unle&s;s under the direction of a phy&s;ician, we &s;hall omit &s;pecifying their particular do&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="012338_0188_0F88EA1317665F28">
IT will be proper frequently to look into the eyes, to &s;ee if any hairs be turned inwards, or pre&s;&s;ing upon them, in order that they may be cut off without delay.</P>
<P>SUCH as are liable to frequent returns of this di&s;ea&s;e, ought con&s;tantly to have an i&s;&s;ue in one or both arms. Bleeding or purging in the &s;pring and autumn, will be very beneficial to &s;uch per&s;ons. They ought likewi&s;e to live re|gularly, avoiding &s;trong liquor, and every thing of a heat|ing quality.

<HEAD>OF THE QUINSEY, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE THROAT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e is very common in Britain, and is fre|quently attended with great danger. It prevails in the win|ter and &s;pring, and is mo&s;t fatal to young people of a &s;an|guine or plethoric habit.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;In general, it proceeds from the &s;ame cau&s;es as other inflammatory fevers, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> an ob&s;tructed per|&s;piration, or whatever heats or inflames the blood. An in|flammation of the throat is often occa&s;ioned by omitting &s;ome part of the covering u&s;ually worn about the neck, by drinking cold liquor when the body is warm, by riding or walking again&s;t a cold northerly wind, or any thing that greatly cools the throat, and parts adjacent. It may like|wi&s;e proceed from the neglect of bleeding, purging, or any cu&s;tomary evacuation.</P>
<P>SINGING, &s;peaking loud and long, or whatever &s;trains the throat, may likewi&s;e cau&s;e an inflammation of that or|gan. I have often known the quin&s;ey prove fatal to jovial companions, after &s;itting long in a warm room, drinking hot liquors and &s;inging with vehemence; e&s;pecially, when they were &s;o imprudent as afterwards to go abroad in the cold night air. Sitting with wet feet, or keeping on wet cloaths, are very apt to occa&s;ion this malady. It is likewi&s;e frequently occa&s;ioned by continuing long in a moi&s;t place, &s;leeping in a damp bed, &s;itting in a room that has been newly pla&s;tered, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I know people who never fail to com|plain of their throat after &s;itting but a very &s;hort while in a room that has been lately wa&s;hed.</P>
<P>ACRID or irritating food may likewi&s;e inflame the throat, and occa&s;ion a quin&s;ey. It may al&s;o proceed from bones, pins, or other &s;harp &s;ub&s;tances &s;ticking in the throat, or
<PB N="185" REF="012338_0189_0F88EA13AB597150">
from the cau&s;tic fumes of metals or minerals, as ar&s;enic, an|timony, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> taken in by the breath. This di&s;ea&s;e is &s;ome|times epidemic and infectious.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;The inflammation of the throat is evident from in&s;pection, the parts appearing red and &s;welled; be&s;ides, the patient complains of pain in &s;wallow|ing any thing. His pul&s;e is quick and hard, with other &s;ymptoms of a fever. If blood be let, it is generally covered with a tough coat of a whiti&s;h colour, and the patient &s;pits a tough phlegm. As the &s;welling and inflammation increa&s;e, the breathing and &s;wallowing become the more difficult, the pain affects the ears; the eyes generally appear red, and the face &s;wells. The patient is often obliged to keep him&s;elf in an erect po&s;ture, being in danger of &s;uffocation; there is a con&s;tant nau&s;ea, or inclination to vomit, and the drink, in|&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing into the &s;tomach, is often returned by the no&s;e. The patient is frequently &s;tarved at la&s;t, merely from an inability of &s;wallowing any kind of nouri&s;hment. When the breathing is performed with a hi&s;&s;ing noi&s;e, and the pul&s;e begins to intermit, death is at hand.</P>
<P>AS &s;everal of the organs nece&s;&s;ary for life are affected by this di&s;ea&s;e, it can never be without danger; no time there|fore &s;hould be lo&s;t in attempting to remove it, as a little de|lay often renders it incurable.</P>
<P>WHEN the breathing is laborious, with &s;traitne&s;s of the brea&s;t and anxiety, the danger is great. Though the pain of &s;wallowing be very great, yet while the patient breathes ea&s;y, there is not &s;o much danger. An external &s;welling is no unfavourable &s;ymptom; but if it &s;uddenly falls, and the morbific matter is thrown upon the brea&s;t, the danger is very great. When a quin&s;ey is the con&s;equence of &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;e, which has already weakened the patient, his &s;ituation is dangerous. A frothing at the mouth, with a &s;welled tongue, a pale gha&s;tly countenance, and coldne&s;s of the extremities, are fatal &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;The regimen in this di&s;ea&s;e is in all re&s;pects the &s;ame as in the pleuri&s;y or peripneumony. The food mu&s;t be light, and in &s;mall quantity, and the drink plentiful, weak, and diluting, mixed with acids.</P>
<P>IT is highly nece&s;&s;ary, in this di&s;ea&s;e, that the patient be kept ea&s;y and quiet. Violent pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, or great efforts of the body, may prove fatal. He &s;hould not even attempt to &s;peak but in a low voice. Such a degree of warmth as to promote a con&s;tant gentle &s;weat is proper. When the
<PB N="186" REF="012338_0190_0F88EA15A10CCCD8">
patient is in bed, his head ought to be rai&s;ed a little higher than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>IT is peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary that the throat be kept warm; for which purpo&s;e &s;everal folds of &s;oft flannel may be wrapt round the neck: That alone will often remove a &s;light complaint of the throat, e&s;pecially if applied in due time. We cannot here omit ob&s;erving the propriety of a cu&s;tom which prevails among&s;t the pea&s;ants of this country; when they feel any unea&s;ine&s;s of the throat, they wrap a &s;tocking about it all night. So effectual is this remedy, that, in many places, it pa&s;&s;es for a charm, and the &s;tock|ing is applied with particular ceremonies: The cu&s;tom, however, is undoubtedly a good one, and &s;hould never be neglected. When the throat has been thus wrapt up all night, it mu&s;t not be expo&s;ed to the cold air through the day, but a handkerchief, or a piece of flannel, kept about it, till the inflammation be gone.</P>
<P>THE jelly of black currants is a medicine very much in e&s;teem for complaints of the throat; and indeed the whole <HI>materia medica</HI> cannot afford a better. It &s;hould be almo&s;t con&s;tantly kept in the mouth, and &s;wallowed down lei&s;ure|ly. It may likewi&s;e be mixed in the patient's drink, or taken any other way. When it cannot be obtained, the red currant jelly, or the mulberry, may be u&s;ed in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>GARGIES for the throat are likewi&s;e very beneficial. They may be made by adding to half an Engli&s;h pint of the pectoral decoction mentioned in page 110, two or three &s;poonfuls of honey, and the &s;ame quantity of currant jelly. This may be u&s;ed three or four times a-day; and, if the patient be troubled with tough vi&s;cid phlegm, the gargle may be made more &s;harp and clean&s;ing, by adding to it a tea &s;poonful of the &s;pirits of <HI>&s;al ammoniac.</HI> Some recom|mend gargles made of a decoction of the leaves or bark of the blackberry bu&s;h; but where the jelly can be had, the&s;e are unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THERE is no di&s;ea&s;e wherein the benefits of bathing the feet and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in lukewarm water are more apparent. That practice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, therefore, never to be neglected. If people were careful to keep warm, to wrap up their throats with flannel, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">he their feet and legs in warm water, and to u&s;e a &s;pare diet, with diluting liquors, at the beginning of this di&s;ea&s;e, it would &s;eldom proceed to any great height, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be attended with any danger; but when the&s;e precauti|ons
<PB N="187" REF="012338_0191_0F88EA1624C289A8">
are neglected, and the di&s;ea&s;e becomes violent, more powerful medicines are nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;An inflammation of the throat being one of the mo&s;t acute and dangerous di&s;tempers, which &s;ometimes takes off the patient in a few hours, the mo&s;t early remedies are, with the greate&s;t care and di|ligence to be admini&s;tered. In the very fir&s;t attack, there|fore, when it is violent, it will be proper to bleed in the arm, or rather in the jugular vein, and to repeat the ope|ration if the &s;ymptoms require.</P>
<P>THE belly &s;hould likewi&s;e be gently opened. This may either be done by giving the patient for his ordinary drink a decoction of figs and tamarinds, or &s;mall do&s;es of rhu|barb and nitre, as recommended in page 172. The&s;e may be increa&s;ed according to the age of the patient, and repeat|ed till they have the de&s;ired effect.</P>
<P>I have often known very good effects from a bit of <HI>&s;al prunel,</HI> or purified nitre, held in the mouth, and &s;wllowed down as it melted. This promotes the di&s;charge of <HI>&s;aliva,</HI> by which means it an&s;wers the end of a gargle, while, at the &s;ame time, it cools the blood, by promoting the di&s;|charge of urine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE throat ought, likewi&s;e, to be rubbed twice or thrice a-day with a little of the volatile liniment. This may be made by taking an ounce of oil of &s;weet almonds, and half an ounce of &s;pirit of hart&s;horn, and &s;haking them together in a vial till they be united. I do not remember ever to have &s;een this fail to produce &s;ome good effects. The throat &s;hould be carefully covered with wool or flannel, to prevent the cold from penetrating the &s;kin, as this application ren|ders it very tender. Many other external applications are recommended in this di&s;ea&s;e, as a &s;wallow's ne&s;t, poultices made of the funges called Jews-ears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But as we do not look upon any of the&s;e to be preferable to a common poultice of bread and milk, we &s;hall take no farther notice of them.</P>
<P>BLISTERING upon the neck, or behind the ears, in vio|lent inflammations of the throat, is very beneficial. After the pla&s;ters are taken off, the part ought to be kept running by the application of &s;harp ointment, till the inflammation is gone; otherwi&s;e, upon their drying up, the patient will be in danger of a relap&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN the patient has been treated as above, a &s;uppura|tion &s;eldom happens. This, however, is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, in
<PB N="188" REF="012338_0192_0F88EA16AC09E918">
&s;pite of all our endeavours to prevent it. When the inflam|mation and &s;welling continue, and it is evident that a &s;up|puration will en&s;ue, it ought to be promoted by drawing the &s;team of warm water into the throat through a tunnel, or the like. Soft poultices ought, likewi&s;e, to be applied outwardly, and the patient may keep a roa&s;ted fig con&s;tant|ly in his mouth.</P>
<P>IT &s;ometimes happens, before the tumour breaks, that the &s;welling is &s;o great, as entirely to prevent any thing from getting down into the &s;tomach. In this ca&s;e, the patient mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h, unle&s;s he can be &s;upported in &s;ome other way. This can only be done by nouri&s;hing cly&s;ters of broth, or gruel with milk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Patients have often been &s;upported by the&s;e for &s;everal days, till the tumour has broke; and afterwards they have recovered.</P>
<P>NOT only the pa&s;&s;age of the food, but the breathing is often prevented by the tumour. In this ca&s;e, nothing can &s;ave the patient's life, but opening the <HI>trachea</HI> or windpipe, That has been &s;o often done with &s;ucce&s;s, that no per&s;on, in &s;uch de&s;perate circum&s;tances, ought to he&s;itate a mo|ment about the operation; but as it can only be performed by a &s;urgeon, it is not nece&s;&s;ary here to give any directions about it.</P>
<P>WHEN a difficulty of &s;wallowing is not attended with an acute pain or inflammation, it is generally owing to an ob|&s;truction of the glands about the throat, and only requires that the part be kept warm, and the throat frequently gar|gled with &s;omewhat that may gently &s;timulate the glands, as a decoction of figs with vinegar and honey; to which may be added a little mu&s;tard, or a &s;mall quantity of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>BUT this kind of gargle is never to be u&s;ed where there are &s;igns of an inflammation. This &s;pecies of <HI>angina</HI> has various names among the common people, as the <HI>pap of the throat,</HI> the falling down of the <HI>almonds of the ears, &amp;c.</HI> Ac|cordingly, to remove it, they pull the patient up by the hair of the head, and thru&s;t their fingers under his jaws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which practices are, at be&s;t, u&s;ele&s;s, and often hurtful.</P>
<P>THOSE who are &s;ubject to inflammations of the throat, in order to prevent too great a fulne&s;s of blood and hu|mours, ought to live temperately. Such as do not choo&s;e to ob&s;erve this rule, mu&s;t have frequent recour&s;e to purging and other evacuations, to di&s;charge the &s;uperfluous hu|mours. They ought likewi&s;e to beware of catching cold,
<PB N="189" REF="012338_0193_0F88EA1777DE1408">
and &s;hould ab&s;tain from aliment and medicines of an a&s;trin|gent or &s;timulating nature.</P>
<P>VIOLENT exerci&s;e, by increa&s;ing the motion and force of the blood, is apt to occa&s;ion an inflammation of the throat, e&s;pecially if cold liquor be drank immediately after it, or the body &s;uffered &s;uddenly to cool. Tho&s;e who would avoid this di&s;ea&s;e, ought, therefore, after &s;peaking aloud, &s;inging, running, drinking warm liquor, or doing any thing that may &s;train the throat, or increa&s;e the circu|lation of the blood towards it, to take care to cool gradu|ally, and to wrap plenty of coverings about their necks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I have often known per&s;ons who had been &s;ubject to &s;ore throats, kept intirely free from that complaint by only wearing a ribband, or a bit of flannel, con&s;tantly about their necks, or by wearing a pair of thicker &s;hoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e may &s;eem trifling, but they have great effect. There is danger indeed in leaving them off, after per&s;ons have been accu|&s;tomed to them; but &s;urely the inconveniency of u&s;ing &s;uch things for life, is not to be compared with the danger which may attend the neglect of them.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE MALIGNANT QUINSEY, OR PUTRID, ULCEROUS SORE THROAT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS kind of quin&s;ey is but little known in the northern parts of Britain, though, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, it has been very fatal in the more &s;outhern counties. Children are more &s;ubject to it than adults, females than males, and the delicate than tho&s;e who are hardy and robu&s;t. It prevails mo&s;t in autumn, or after a long cour&s;e of damp, or fultry weather.</P>
<P>CAUSE.&mdash;This is evidently a contageous di&s;tem|per, and is generally communicated by infection. Whole families, and even entire villages often receive the infection from one per&s;on. This ought to put people upon their guard again&s;t going near &s;uch patients as labour under the di&s;order; as by that means they endanger not only their own lives, but likewi&s;e tho&s;e of their friends and connecti|ons.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;It begins with alternate fits of &s;hivering and heat. The pul&s;e is quick, but low and une|qual, and generally continues &s;o through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. The patient complains greatly of weakne&s;s
<PB N="190" REF="012338_0194_0F88EA182F289608">
and oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t; his &s;pirits are low, and he is apt to faint away when &s;et upright; he is troubled with a nau&s;ea, and often with a vomiting or purging. The two latter are mo&s;t common in children. The eyes appear red and watery, and the face &s;wells. The urine is at fir&s;t pale and crude; but, as the di&s;ea&s;e advances, it turns more of a yellowi&s;h colour. The tongue is white, and generally moi&s;t, which di&s;tingui&s;hes this from an in|flammatory di&s;ea&s;e. Upon looking into the throat it ap|pears &s;welled, and of a florid red colour. Pale, or a&s;h-coloured &s;pots, however, are here and there inter&s;per&s;ed, and &s;ometimes one broad patch or &s;pot, of an irregular fi|gure, and pale white colour, &s;urrounded with florid red only appears. The&s;e whiti&s;h &s;pots, or &s;loughs, cover &s;o many ulcers underneath.</P>
<P>AN efflore&s;cence, or eruption upon the neck, arms, brea&s;t, and fingers, about the &s;econd or third day, is a common &s;ymptom of this di&s;ea&s;e. When it appears, the purging and vomiting generally cea&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE is often a &s;light degree of delirium, and the face frequently appears blotted, and the in&s;ide of the no&s;trils red and inflamed. The patient complains of a di&s;agreeable, putrid &s;mell, and his breath is very offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>THE putrid, ulcerous &s;ore throat, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the inflammatory, by the vomiting and loo&s;ene&s;s, with which it is generally u&s;hered in; by the foul ulcers in the throat, covered with a white or livid coat; and, by the exce&s;&s;ive weakne&s;s of the patient; with other &s;ymptoms of a putrid fever.</P>
<P>UNFAVOURABLE &s;ymptoms are, an ob&s;tinate purging, extreme weakne&s;s, dimne&s;s of the &s;ight, a livid or black colour of the &s;pots, and frequent &s;hiverings, with a weak, fluttering pul&s;e. If the eruption upon the &s;kin &s;uddenly di&s;appears, or becomes of a livid colour, with a di&s;|charge of blood from the no&s;e or mouth, the danger is very great.</P>
<P>IF a gentle &s;weat breaks out about the third or fourth day, and continues with a &s;low, firm, and equal pul&s;e; if the &s;loughs ca&s;t off in a kindly manner, and appear clean and florid at the bottom; and if the breathing be &s;oft and free, with a lively colour of the eyes, there is rea&s;on to hope for a &s;alutary cri&s;is.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;The patient mu&s;t be kept quiet, and, for the mo&s;t part, in bed, as he will be apt to faint when taken out of it. His food mu&s;t be nouri&s;hing and
<PB N="191" REF="012338_0195_0F88EA19D394FC38">
re&s;torative; as &s;ago gruel with red wine, jellies, broths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> His drink ought to be generous, and of an anti&s;ep|tic quality; as red wine negas, white wine whey, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;The medicine in this kind of quin&s;ey is entirely different from that which is proper in the inflammatory. All evacuations, as bleeding, purging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which weaken the patient, mu&s;t be avoided. Cooling medicines, as nitre, and cream of tartar, are, likewi&s;e, hurtful. Strengthening cordials alone can be u&s;ed with &s;afety; and the&s;e ought never to be neglected.</P>
<P>IF, at the beginning, there be a great nau&s;ea, or incli|nation to vomit, the patient mu&s;t drink an infu&s;ion of green tea, camomile flowers, or <HI>carduus benedictus,</HI> in order to clean the &s;tomach. If the&s;e be not &s;ufficient, he may take a few grains of the powder of ipecacuanha, or any other gentle vomit.</P>
<P>IF the di&s;ea&s;e be mild, the throat may be gargled with an infu&s;ion of &s;age and ro&s;e leaves, to a gill of which may be added a &s;poonful or two of honey, and as much vinegar as will make it agreeably &s;harp; but, when the &s;ymptoms are urgent, the &s;loughs large and thick, and the breath ve|ry offen&s;ive, the following gargle may be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>TO &s;ix or &s;even ounces of the pectoral decoction, when boiling, add half an ounce of contrayerva root; let it boil for &s;ome time, and afterwards &s;train the liquor; to which add two ounces of white wine vinegar, an ounce of fine honey, and an ounce of the tincture of myrrh. This ought not only to be u&s;ed as a gargle, but a little of it &s;hould frequently be injected with a &s;yringe to clean the mouth, be|fore the patient takes any meat or drink. This method is pe|culiarly nece&s;&s;ary for children, who cannot u&s;e a gargle.</P>
<P>IT will be of great benefit if the patient frequently re|ceives into his mouth, through an inverted funnel, the &s;teams of warm vinegar, myrrh, and honey.</P>
<P>WHEN the putrid &s;ymptoms run high, and the di&s;ea&s;e is attended with danger, the only medicine that can be de|pended upon is the Je&s;uits bark. It may be taken in &s;ub|&s;tance, if the patient's &s;tomach will bear it. If not, an ounce of bark gro&s;sly powdered, with two drams of Virgi|nian &s;nakeroot, may be boiled in an Engli&s;h pint and an half of water, to half a pint; to which a tea &s;poonful of the elixir of vitriol may be added, and an ordinary tea cupful of it taken every three or four hours. Bli&s;tering pla&s;ters
<PB N="192" REF="012338_0196_0F88EA1A7801A198">
are very beneficial in this di&s;ea&s;e, e&s;pecially when the pati|ent's pul&s;e and &s;pirits are low. They may be applied to the throat, behind the ears, or upon the back-part of the neck.</P>
<P>SHOULD the vomiting prove trouble&s;ome, it will be pro|per to give the patient two table &s;poonfuls of the &s;aline ju|lep, recommended in page 175, every two hours, or oftener, if nece&s;&s;ary. Tea made of mint and a little cinnamon, will likewi&s;e be a proper drink, e&s;pecially if an equal quantity of red wine be mixed with it.</P>
<P>IN ca&s;e of a violent loo&s;ene&s;s, the &s;ize of a nutmeg of <HI>dia&s;cordium,</HI> or the Japonic confection, may be taken two or three times a-day, or oftener, if nece&s;&s;ary; and the pa|tient's drink mu&s;t be red wine negas.</P>
<P>IF a di&s;charge of blood from the no&s;e happens, the &s;teams of warm vinegar may be received up the no&s;trils fre|quently; and the drink may be &s;harpened with &s;pirits of vitriol, or tincture of ro&s;es.</P>
<P>IN ca&s;e of a &s;trangury, the belly mu&s;t be fomented with warm water, and emollient cly&s;ters given three or four times a-day.</P>
<P>AFTER the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e is over, the belly &s;hould be opened with mild purgatives; as manna, &s;enna, rhubarb, or the like.</P>
<P>IF great weakne&s;s and dejection of &s;pirits, or night &s;weats, with other &s;ymptoms of a con&s;umption, &s;hould re|main after this di&s;ea&s;e, we would recommend it to the pati|ent to continue the u&s;e of the Je&s;uits bark, with the elixir of vitriol, and to take frequently a gla&s;s of generous wine. The&s;e, together with a milk diet, and riding on hor&s;eback, are the mo&s;t likely means for recovering his &s;trength.</P>

<HEAD>OF COLDS.</HEAD>
<P>IT has already been ob&s;erved, that colds are the effect of an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration; the common cau&s;es of which we have likewi&s;e endeavoured to point out, and &s;hall not here repeat them. Neither &s;hall we &s;pend time in enumerating all the various &s;ymptoms of colds, as they are pretty generally known. It may not, however, be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that almo&s;t every cold is a kind of fever, and only differs in degree from &s;ome of tho&s;e which have already been treated of.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="012338_0197_0F88EA1B52B283A8">
No age, &s;ex, nor con&s;titution, are exempted from this di&s;ea&s;e; neither is it in the power of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> to prevent it. The inhabitants of every climate are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">able to catch cold, nor can even the greate&s;t circum&s;pection defend them again&s;t its attacks. Indeed, if the human body could be kept con&s;tantly in an uniform degree of warmth, &s;uch a thing as catching cold would be impo&s;&s;ible: But as that cannot be effected by any means, the per&s;piration mu&s;t be liable to many changes. Such changes, however, when &s;mall, do not affect the health; but, when exce&s;&s;ive, they mu&s;t prove hurtful. Hence the great &s;ecret of preventing colds, lies in avoiding, as far as po&s;&s;ible, all extremes ei|ther of heat or cold.</P>
<P>WHEN oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t, a &s;tuffing of the no&s;e, unu&s;ual wearine&s;s, or a pain of the head, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> give ground to believe that the per&s;piration is ob&s;tructed, or, in other words, that the per&s;on has caught cold, he ought imme|diately to le&s;&s;en his diet, at lea&s;t, the u&s;ual quantity of his &s;olid food, and to ab&s;tain from all &s;trong liquors. In&s;tead of fle&s;h, fi&s;h, eggs, milk, and other nouri&s;hing diet, he may eat light bread pudding, veal, or chicken broth, paps, or gruels, and &s;uch like. His drink may be water gruel, &s;weetened with a little honey; an infu&s;ion of balm, or lin&s;eed, &s;harpened with the juice of orange or lemon; a decoction of barley and liquorice, with tamarinds, or any other cool, diluting acid liquor.</P>
<P>ABOVE all, his &s;upper &s;hould be light; as &s;mall po&s;&s;et, or water gruel, &s;weetened with honey, and a little toa&s;ted bread in it. If honey &s;hould di&s;agree with the &s;tomach, the gruel may be &s;weetened with treacle, or coar&s;e &s;ugar, and &s;harpened with the jelly of currants. Tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to generous liquors, may take white wine whey in&s;tead of gruel, which may be &s;weetened as above.</P>
<P>THE patient ought to lie longer than u&s;ual in bed, and to encourage a gentle &s;weat, which is ea&s;ily brought on towards morning, by drinking tea, or any kind of warm diluting liquor. I have often known this practice, in a day or two, carry off a cold, which, in all probability, had it been neglected, would have co&s;t the patient his life, or have confined him for &s;ome months to his bed. Would people &s;acrifice a little time to ea&s;e and warmth, and prac|tice a moderate degree of ab&s;tinence when the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of a cold appear, we have rea&s;on to believe, that mo&s;t of the bad effects which flow from an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration,
<PB N="194" REF="012338_0198_0F88EA1C419CB070">
might be prevented. But, after the di&s;ea&s;e has gathered &s;trength by delay, all attempts to remove it, often prove in vain. A pleuri&s;y, a peripneumony, or a fatal con&s;umption of the lungs, are the common effects of colds that have ei|ther been totally neglected, or treated improperly.</P>
<P>MANY attempt to cure a cold, by getting drunk. But this, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it, is a very hazardous and fool|hardy experiment. No doubt it may &s;ometimes &s;ucceed, by &s;uddenly re&s;toring the per&s;piration; but when there is any degree of inflammation, which is frequently the ca&s;e, &s;trong liquors, in&s;tead of removing the malady, will in|crea&s;e it. By this means a common cold is often convert|ed into an inflammatory fever.</P>
<P>WHEN tho&s;e who labour for their daily bread have the misfortune to catch cold, they grudge to lo&s;e a day or two, in order to keep them&s;elves warm, and take a little medi|cine, by which means the di&s;order is often &s;o aggravated, as to confine them for a long while, or even to render them ever after unable to &s;u&s;tain hard labour. Such of the labouring poor as can afford to take care of them&s;elves, are often too hardy to do it; they affect to de&s;pi&s;e colds, and as long as they can crawl about, &s;corn to be confined by what they call a <HI>common cold.</HI> Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that colds de&s;troy &s;uch numbers of mankind. Like an enemy de&s;pi&s;ed, they gather &s;trength from delay, till, at length, they become invincible. We often &s;ee this verifi|ed in travellers, who, rather than lo&s;e a day in the pro&s;e|cution of their bu&s;ine&s;s, throw away their lives, by pur&s;u|ing their journey with this di&s;ea&s;e upon them, even in the colde&s;t &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>BUT colds may be too much as well as too little indulged. When a per&s;on, for a &s;light cold, &s;huts him&s;elf up in a warm room, and drinks great quantities of warm liquor, it may bring on &s;uch a general relaxation of the &s;olids as will not be ea&s;ily removed.

<HEAD>OF COUGHS.</HEAD>
<P>A cough is generally the effect of a cold, which has ei|ther been improperly treated, or intirely neglected. When it proves ob&s;tinate, there is always rea&s;on to fear the con&s;e|quences, as this &s;hews a weak &s;tate of the lungs, and is often the forerunner of a con&s;umption.</P>
<P>IF the cough be violent, and the patient young and &s;trong, with a hard quick pul&s;e, bleeding will be nece&s;&s;ary, to le&s;&s;en the quantity of the humours, and prevent a rup|ture of the blood-ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but in weak and relaxed habits, bleeding rather prolongs the di&s;ea&s;e. When the patient &s;pits freely, bleeding is unnece&s;&s;ary, and &s;ome|times hurtful, as it tends to le&s;&s;en that di&s;charge.</P>
<P>WHEN the cough is not attended with a fever, and the &s;pittle is vi&s;cid and tough, &s;harp pectoral medicines are to be ad|mini&s;tered; as gum ammoniac, &s;quills, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The &s;olution of gum ammoniac may be prepared as directed in page 117,
<PB N="196" REF="012338_0200_0F88EA212E5DACB8">
and two table &s;poonfuls of it taken three or four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a-day, more or le&s;s, according to the age and con&s;titution of the patient. Squills may be given various ways; two ounces of the vinegar, the oxymel, or the &s;yrup, may be mixed with the &s;ame quantity of &s;pirituous cinnamon water, to which may be added, an ounce of common water, and an ounce of bal&s;amic &s;yrup. Two table &s;poonfuls of this mix|ture may be taken three or four times a-day.</P>
<P>A &s;yrup made of equal parts of lemon juice, honey and &s;ugar-candy, is likewi&s;e very proper in this kind of cough&punc; A table &s;poonful of it may be taken at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>WHEN the defluxion is &s;harp and thin, the&s;e medicines rather do hurt. In this ca&s;e, gentle opiates, oils, and mu|cilages are proper. A cup of the infu&s;ion of wild poppy leaves, with mar&s;h mallow roots, or the flowers of coltsfoot, may be taken frequently; or a tea &s;poonful of the parego|ric elixir may be put into the patient's drink twice a-day. He may likewi&s;e take an emul&s;ion made of an ounce and an half of olive oil, &s;ix ounces of water, one ounce of pec|toral &s;yrup, and a tea &s;poonful of &s;pirits of hart&s;horn. The&s;e mu&s;t be well &s;haken together, and two table &s;poonfuls of the mixture taken every three or four hours. Fuller's Spani&s;h infu&s;ion is al&s;o a very proper medicine in this ca&s;e, and may be taken, if the above &s;hould di&s;agree with the patient's &s;to|mach. It is made by infu&s;ing in an Engli&s;h quart of boil|ing water, two drams of &s;alt of tartar, half a dram of &s;affron cut into &s;mall pieces, and an ounce of Spani&s;h juice like|wi&s;e cut &s;mall. The&s;e mu&s;t &s;tand in a clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el for twen|ty-four hours, in a gentle degree of warmth. Afterwards, let the infu&s;ion be &s;trained, and a tea cupful of it taken three or four times a-day.</P>
<P>WHEN a cough is occa&s;ioned by acrid humours tickling the throat and <HI>fauces,</HI> the patient &s;hould keep &s;ome &s;oft pectoral lozenges almo&s;t con&s;tantly in his mouth; as the Pontefract liquorice cakes, barley &s;ugar, the Spani&s;h juice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e blunt the acrimony of the humours, and by taking off their &s;timulating quality, help to appea&s;e the cough.</P>
<P>IN ob&s;tinate coughs, proceeding from a flux of humours upon the lungs, it will often be nece&s;&s;ary, be&s;ides expec|torating medicines, to have recour&s;e to i&s;&s;ues, &s;etons, or &s;ome other drain. In this ca&s;e, I have always ob&s;erved the mo&s;t happy effects from a Burgundy pitch pla&s;ter applied between the &s;houlders. I have ordered this &s;imple remedy in the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate coughs, in a great number of ca&s;es, and in many different con&s;titutions, without ever knowing
<PB N="197" REF="012338_0201_0F88EA22020C8D28">
it fail, unle&s;s where there were evident &s;igns of an ulcer in the lungs. About the bulk of a nutmeg of Burgundy pitch may be &s;pread thin upon a piece of &s;oft leather, about the &s;ize of the hand, and laid between the &s;houlder-blades. It may be taken off and wiped every three or four days, and ought to be renewed once a fortnight or three weeks. This is indeed a cheap and &s;imple medicine, and con&s;equently apt to be de&s;pi&s;ed; but we will venture to affirm, that the whole <HI>materia medica</HI> does not afford an application more ef|ficacious in almo&s;t every kind of cough. It has not, indeed, an immediate effect; but, if continued long enough, it will &s;ucceed where mo&s;t other medicines fail.</P>
<P>THE only inconveniency attending this pla&s;ter is the itch|ing, which it occa&s;ions in the part to which it is applied; but &s;urely this may be di&s;pen&s;ed with, con&s;idering the ad|vantage which the patient may expect to reap from the ap|plication; be&s;ides, when the itching becomes very unea&s;y, the pla&s;ter may be taken off, and the part rubbed with a dry cloth, or wa&s;hed with a little warm milk and water. Some caution, indeed, is nece&s;&s;ary in di&s;continuing the u&s;e of &s;uch a pla&s;ter; this, however, may be &s;afely done by making it &s;maller by degrees, and at length quitting it al|together in a warm &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>BUT coughs proceed from many other cau&s;es be&s;ides de|fluxions upon the lungs. In the&s;e ca&s;es the cure is not to be attempted by pectoral medicines. Thus, in a cough pro|ceeding from a foulne&s;s and debility of the &s;tomach, &s;yrups, oils, mucilages, and all kind of bal&s;amic medicines, do hurt. This cough may be known from one that is owing to a fault in the lungs by this mark, that in the latter the patient coughs whenever he in&s;pires, or draws in his breath fully; but in the former that does not happen.</P>
<P>THE cure of this cough depends chiefly upon clean&s;ing and &s;trengthening the &s;tomach; for which purpo&s;e gentle vomits and bitter purgatives are mo&s;t proper. Thus, after a vomit or two, the &s;acred tincture, as it is called, may be taken for a con&s;iderable time, in the do&s;e of a table &s;poonful or two twice a-day, or as often as it is found nece&s;&s;ary to keep the belly gently open. People may make this tincture them&s;elves, by infu&s;ing an ounce of <HI>hiera picra</HI> in an Engli&s;h pint of white wine, letting it &s;tand a few days, and then &s;training it off for u&s;e.</P>
<P>IN coughs, which proceed from a debility of the &s;tomach, the Je&s;uits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ark is, likewi&s;e, of con&s;iderable u&s;e. It may
<PB N="198" REF="012338_0202_0F88EA22C0845300">
either be chewed, taken in powder, or made into a tincture along with other &s;tomachic bitters.</P>
<P>A <HI>nervous cough</HI> can only be removed by change of air, and proper exerci&s;e; to which may be added the u&s;e of gentle opiates. A tea &s;poonful of the paregoric elixir, or two of the &s;aponaceous pills may be taken twice a-day. If the&s;e prove too weak, ten, fifteen, or twenty drops of li|quid laudanum, more or le&s;s, as circum&s;tances require, may be taken at bed-time, or when the cough is mo&s;t trouble&s;ome. Putting the feet and hands in warm wa|ter, will often appea&s;e the violence of a nervous cough.</P>
<P>WHEN a cough is only the &s;ymptom of &s;ome other ma|lady, it is in vain to attempt to remove it without fir&s;t cu|ring the di&s;ea&s;e from which it proceeds. Thus, when a cough is occa&s;ioned by the cutting of teeth; keeping the belly open, &s;carifying the gums, or whatever facilitates the teething, likewi&s;e appea&s;es the cough. In like manner, when worms occa&s;ion a cough, &s;uch medicines as remove the&s;e, will generally cure the cough; as bitter purgatives, oily cly&s;ters, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>WOMEN, during the la&s;t months of pregnancy, are often greatly afflicted with a cough, which is generally relieved by bleeding, and keeping the belly open. They ought to avoid all flatulent food, and to wear a loo&s;e ea&s;y dre&s;s.</P>
<P>A cough is not only a &s;ymptom, but is often, likewi&s;e, the forerunner of di&s;ea&s;es. Thus, the gout is frequently u&s;hered in by a very trouble&s;ome cough, which affects the patient for &s;ome days before the coming on of the fit. A pa|roxy&s;m of the gout generally removes this cough, which &s;hould, therefore, be promoted, by keeping the extremities warm, drinking warm liquors, and bathing the feet and legs frequently in lukewarm water.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF THE CHIN-COUGH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS cough &s;eldom affect adults, but is often epidemical among children. Such children as live upon thin watery diet, who breathe unwhole&s;ome air, and have too little ex|erci&s;e, are mo&s;t liable to this di&s;ea&s;e, and generally &s;uffer mo&s;t from it.</P>
<P>THE chin-cough is &s;o well known, even to nur&s;es, that no de&s;cription of it is nece&s;&s;ary. Whatever hurts the dige&s;t|ion, ob&s;tructs the per&s;piration, or relaxes the &s;olids, pre|di&s;po&s;es
<PB N="199" REF="012338_0203_0F88EA2385727090">
to this di&s;ea&s;e; con&s;equently its cure mu&s;t depend upon cleaning and &s;trengthening the &s;tomach, bracing the &s;olids, and, at the &s;ame time, promoting per&s;piration, and the different &s;ecretions.</P>
<P>THE diet in this di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t be light, and of ea&s;y dige&s;t|ion; for children, good bread made into pap or pudding, chicken broth, with other light &s;poon meats, are proper; but tho&s;e who are farther advanced, may be allowed &s;ago gruel, and, if the fever be not high, a little boiled chick|en, or other white meats. The drink may be pennyroyal tea, &s;weetened with honey or &s;ugar-candy, &s;mall wine whey; or, if the patient be weak, he may &s;ometimes be allowed a little negas.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t effectual remedy in this di&s;ea&s;e is change of air. This often removes the malady, even when the change &s;eems to be from a purer to a le&s;s whole&s;ome air. This may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, depend on the patient's being re|moved from the place where the infection prevails. Mo&s;t of the di&s;ea&s;es of children are infectious; nor is it at all uncommon to find the chin-cough prevailing in one town or village, when another, at a very &s;mall di&s;tance, is quite free from it. But, whatever be the cau&s;e, we are &s;ure of the fact. No time ought, therefore, to be lo&s;t in removing the patient at &s;ome di&s;tance from the place where he caught the di&s;ea&s;e, and, if po&s;&s;ible, into a more pure and dry air.</P>
<P>WHEN the di&s;ea&s;e proves violent, and the patient is in danger of being &s;uffocated by the cough, he ought to be bled, e&s;pecially if there be a fever with a hard full pul&s;e. But, as the chief intention of bleeding is to prevent a rupture of the blood ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, and to render it more &s;afe to give vomits, it will &s;eldom be nece&s;&s;ary to repeat the operation; yet, if there be &s;ymptoms of an inflammation of the lungs, a &s;econd, or even a third bleeding may be re|qui&s;ite.</P>
<P>IT is a favourable &s;ymptom when the patient vomits after the fit. This cleans the &s;tomach, and greatly relieves the cough. It will, therefore, be proper to promote the di&s;|charge, either by camomile tea, or lukewarm water; and, when the&s;e are not &s;ufficient, &s;mall do&s;es of ipecacuanha may be given. A child of three or four years of age may take five or &s;ix grains; and to others, le&s;s or more mu&s;t be given, according to their age and &s;trength.</P>
<P>IT is very difficult to make children drink after a vomit. I have often &s;een them happily deceived, by infu&s;ing a &s;cru|ple
<PB N="200" REF="012338_0204_0F88EA24358C6B78">
or half a dram, of the powder of ipecacuanha in a tea-pot, with half an Engli&s;h pint of boiling water. If this be di&s;gui&s;ed with a few drops of milk, and a little &s;ugar, they will imagine it tea, and drink it very greedily. A &s;mall tea cupful of this may be given every quarter of an hour, or rather every ten minutes, till it operates. When they begin to puke, there will be no occa&s;ion for drinking any more, as the water already on their &s;tomach will be &s;uffi|cient.</P>
<P>VOMITS not only clean the &s;tomach, which, in this di&s;|ea&s;e is generally loaded with vi&s;cid phlegm, but they like|wi&s;e promote the per&s;piration and other &s;ecretions; and ought, therefore, to be repeated, according to the ob&s;tina|cy of the di&s;ea&s;e. They &s;hould not, however, be too &s;trong; gentle vomits, frequently repeated, are both le&s;s dangerous, and more beneficial than &s;trong ones.</P>
<P>AS the patient is generally co&s;tive, it will be proper to keep his belly gently open. The be&s;t medicines for this purpo&s;e are rhubarb and its preparations, or the &s;acred tinc|ture, if the patient can be brought to take it. Of this a tea &s;poonful or two may be given to a young child twice or thrice a-day, as there is occa&s;ion. To &s;uch as are farther advanced, the do&s;e mu&s;t be proportionally increa&s;ed, and repeated till it has the de&s;ired effect. Tho&s;e who cannot be brought to take the bitter tincture, may have an infu&s;ion of &s;enna and prunes, &s;weetened with manna, coar&s;e &s;ugar, or honey; or a few grains of rhubarb, mixed with a &s;poon|ful or two of &s;yrup, or currant jelly, &s;o as to di&s;gui&s;e the ta&s;te. Mo&s;t children are fond of &s;yrups and jellies, and &s;eldom refu&s;e even a bitter medicine when mixed with them.</P>
<P>MANY people believe that oily, pectoral, and bal&s;amic medicines, po&s;&s;e&s;s wonderful virtues for the cure of the chin-cough, and accordingly exhibit them plentifully to patients of every age and con&s;titution, without con&s;idering that every thing of this nature mu&s;t load the &s;tomach, hurt the dige&s;tion, and, of cour&s;e, aggravate the di&s;order.</P>
<P>THE <HI>millepedes,</HI> or woodlice, are greatly recommended for the cure of a chin-cough. Tho&s;e who choo&s;e to make u&s;e of the&s;e in&s;ects, may infu&s;e two ounces of them brui&s;ed in an Engli&s;h pint of &s;mall white wine for one night. Af|terwards the liquor may be &s;trained through a cloth, and a table &s;poonful of it given to the patient three or four times a-day.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="012338_0205_0F88EA2510FFBAF8">
OPIATES are &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to allay the violence of the cough. For this purpo&s;e, a little of the &s;yrup of poppies, or ten, fifteen, or twenty drops, according to the age of the patient, of the paregoric elixir, may be taken in a cup of hy&s;&s;op, or pennyroyal tea, three or four times a-day. An adult may take a table &s;poonful of the &s;yrup, or a tea &s;poonful of the elixir.</P>
<P>THE garlic ointment is a well known remedy in North-Britain for the chin-cough. It is made by beating in a mortar garlic with an equal quantity of hogs lard, but|ter, or oil. With this the &s;oles of the feet may be rubbed twice or thrice a-day, or it may be &s;pread thin upon a rag, and applied as a pla&s;ter. It &s;hould be renewed every night and morning at lea&s;t, as the garlic &s;oon lo&s;es its virtue. This is an exceeding good medicine, both in the chin-cough, and in mo&s;t other coughs of an ob&s;tinate nature. It ought not, however, to be u&s;ed when the patient is very hot, or feveri&s;h, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t it increa&s;e the&s;e &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>THE feet &s;hould be bathed once every two or three days in warm water; and the Burgundy pitch pla&s;ter, mention|ed in page 196, may be applied betwixt the &s;houlders. But when the di&s;ea&s;e proves very violent, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, in&s;tead of it, to apply a bli&s;tering pla&s;ter, and to keep the part open for &s;ome time with i&s;&s;ue ointment.</P>
<P>WHEN the di&s;ea&s;e is prolonged, and the patient is free of a fever, the Je&s;uits bark, and other bitters, are the mo&s;t proper medicines. The bark may either be taken in &s;ub|&s;tance, or in a decoction or infu&s;ion, as is mo&s;t agreeable to the patient. For a child, ten, fifteen, or twenty grains may be given for a do&s;e, according to the age of the patient. For an adult, half a dram, or two &s;cruples, will be proper. Some give the extract of the bark with cantharides; but to manage this, requires &s;ome &s;kill and attention. It is more &s;afe to give a few grains of ca&s;tor along with the bark. A child of &s;ix or &s;even years of age may take &s;even or eight grains of ca&s;tor, with fifteen grains of powdered bark, for a do&s;e. This may be made into a mixture, with two or three ounces of any &s;imple di&s;tilled water, and a little &s;yrup, and taken three or four times a-day.</P>

<HEAD>INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, and requires the mo&s;t &s;peedy a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as it frequently ends in a &s;uppuration; and &s;ometimes in a mortification, which is certain death.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="012338_0206_0F88EA25ADE515A0">
CAUSES.&mdash;It may proceed from any of the cau&s;es which produce an inflammatory fever; as cold li|quor drank while the body is warm, an ob&s;tructed per&s;pi|ration, the &s;udden &s;triking in of any eruption, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It may likewi&s;e proceed from the acrimony of the bile, or from acrid and &s;timulating &s;ub&s;tances taken into the &s;to|mach; as &s;trong vomits or purges, corro&s;ive poi&s;ons, and &s;uch like. When the gout has been repelled from the ex|tremities, either by cold or improper applications, it often occa&s;ions an inflammation of the &s;tomach. Hard or indi|ge&s;table &s;ub&s;tances taken into the &s;tomach, as bones, the &s;hells of nuts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have likewi&s;e that effect.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;It is attended with a fixed pain and burning heat in the &s;tomach; great re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and anxiety; a &s;mall, quick, hard pul&s;e; vomiting, or, at lea&s;t, a nau&s;ea and &s;ickne&s;s; exce&s;&s;ive thir&s;t; coldne&s;s of the extremities; difficulty of breathing; cold clammy &s;weats; and &s;ometimes convul&s;ions and fainting fits. The &s;tomach is &s;welled, and often feels hard to the touch. One of the mo&s;t certain &s;igns of this di&s;ea&s;e is the &s;en&s;e of pain, which the patient feels upon taking any kind of food or drink, e&s;pecially if too hot or cold, into his &s;tomach.</P>
<P>WHEN the patient vomits every thing he eats or drinks, is extremely re&s;tle&s;s, has a hiccup, with an intermit|ting pul&s;e, and frequent fainting fits, the danger is very great.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;The patient mu&s;t, with the greate&s;t care, avoid all acrimonious, heating, and irrita|ting food and drink. His weakne&s;s may deceive the by|&s;tanders, and induce them to give him wines, &s;pirits, or other cordials; but all the&s;e increa&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e, and of|ten occa&s;ion &s;udden death. The inclination to vomit, may likewi&s;e impo&s;e on the attendants, and make them think a vomit nece&s;&s;ary; but that too is almo&s;t certain death.</P>
<P>THE food mu&s;t be light, thin, cool, and ea&s;y of dige&s;t|ion. It mu&s;t be given in &s;mall quantities, and &s;hould nei|ther be quite cold nor too hot. Thin gruel made of bar|ley or oatmeal, light toa&s;ted bread, di&s;&s;olved in boiling water, or very weak chicken broth, are the mo&s;t proper. The drink &s;hould be clear whey, barley water, or decocti|ons of emollient vegetables; or liquorice and mar&s;h mal|low roots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

MEDICINE.&mdash;Bleeding in this di&s;ea&s;e is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and is almo&s;t the only medicine that can be depended on. When the di&s;ea&s;e proves ob&s;tinate, it will often be nece&s;&s;ary to repeat this operation &s;everal times, nor mu&s;t the low &s;tate of the pul&s;e deter us from doing &s;o. The pul&s;e in this di&s;ea&s;e generally ri&s;es upon bleeding, and &s;o long as that is the ca&s;e, the operation is &s;afe.</P>

Flan|nel cloths dipped in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, mu&s;t be applied to the region of the &s;tomach, and removed as they turn cool. They mu&s;t neither be applied too warm, nor &s;uffered to continue till they become quite cold, as either of the&s;e extremes would aggravate the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE feet and legs ought, likewi&s;e, to be frequently bathed in lukewarm water, and warm bricks, or poultices, may be applied to the &s;oles of the feet.</P>
<P>THE only internal medicines which we &s;hall venture to recommend in this di&s;ea&s;e, are mild cly&s;ters. The&s;e may be made of warm water, or thin water gruel, and, if the patient be co&s;tive, a little &s;weet oil, honey or manna, may be added.

<HEAD>OF THE ILIAC PASSION.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is one of the mo&s;t painful and dangerous di&s;ea&s;es that mankind are liable to. It proceeds from the &s;ame <HI>cau&s;es</HI> as the inflammation of the &s;tomach; to which may be added co&s;tivene&s;s, worms, eating unripe fruits, or great quantities of nuts, drinking hard windy malt liquors, as &s;tale beer, bottled ale, or &s;our wine, cider, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It may, likewi&s;e, be occa&s;ioned by a rupture, &s;cirrhous tumours of the inte&s;tines, or by their oppo&s;ite &s;ides growing together.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;ymptoms</HI> here are nearly the &s;ame as in the forego|ing di&s;ea&s;e; only the pain, if po&s;&s;ible, is more acute, and is &s;ituate lower down about the region of the navel. The vomiting is likewi&s;e more violent, and &s;ometimes even the excrements, together with the cly&s;ters and &s;uppo&s;itaries,
<PB N="204" REF="012338_0208_0F88EA272A8ADA98">
are di&s;charged by the mouth. The patient is continually belching up wind, and has often an ob&s;truction of his urine.</P>
<P>WHILE the pain &s;hifts, and the vomiting only returns at certain intervals, and while the cly&s;ters pa&s;s downwards, there is ground to hope; but when the cly&s;ters and <HI>foeces</HI> are vo|mited, and the patient is exceeding weak, with a low fluttering pul&s;e, a pale countenance, and a di&s;agreeable, or &s;tinking breath, there is great rea&s;on to fear, that the con&s;equences will prove fatal. Clammy &s;weats, black foetid &s;tools, with a &s;mall intermitting pul&s;e, and a total ce&s;&s;ation of pain, are the &s;igns of a gangrene, and approaching death.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;The regimen in this di&s;ea&s;e is in general the &s;ame as in an inflammation of the &s;tomach. The patient mu&s;t be kept quiet, avoiding cold, and all vi|olent pa&s;&s;ions of the mind. His food mu&s;t be thin, weak, and given in &s;mall quantities; his drink weak and diluting; as clear whey, barley water, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;Bleeding in this, as well as in the inflammation of the &s;tomach, is the remedy mo&s;t to be depended on. It &s;hould be performed as &s;oon as the &s;ymp|toms appear, and mu&s;t be repeated according to the &s;trength of the patient, and the violence of the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>A bli&s;tering pla&s;ter applied immediately over the part where the mo&s;t violent pain is, has often a very good effect. Even cly&s;ters, which before had no effect, will operate when the bli&s;ter begins to ri&s;e.</P>
<P>FOMENTATIONS and laxative cly&s;ters are by no means to be omitted. The patient's feet and legs &s;hould fre|quently be bathed in warm water; and cloths dipped in it applied to his belly. Bladders, filled with warm water, may likewi&s;e be applied to the region of the navel, and warm bricks, or bottles filled with warm water, to the &s;oles of the feet. The cly&s;ters may be made of barley wa|ter or thin gruel, and &s;oftened with plenty of &s;weet oil, or fre&s;h butter. The&s;e may be admini&s;tered every two or three hours, or oftener, if the patient continues co&s;tive.</P>
<P>IF common cly&s;ters have not the de&s;ired effect, we would recommend the &s;moke of tobacco. It may be blown into the bowels through an inverted pipe. This may be repeat|ed after &s;ome time, unle&s;s the effect of the fir&s;t renders it unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IF the di&s;ea&s;e does not yield to cly&s;ters and fomentations, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to pretty &s;trong purgatives; but as
<PB N="205" REF="012338_0209_0F88EA29A113F0F8">
the&s;e, by irritating the bowels, often increa&s;e their contrac|tion, and, by that means, fru&s;trate their own intention, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to join them with opiates; the&s;e, by al|laying the pain, and relaxing the &s;pa&s;modic contractions of the guts, greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t the operation of purgatives in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>WHAT often an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of purging very well, is a &s;olution of the bitter purging &s;alts. Two ounces of the&s;e may be di&s;&s;olved in an Engli&s;h pint of warm water, or thin gruel, and two or three table &s;poonfuls given every half hour till it operates. At the &s;ame time, fifteen, twen|ty, or twenty-five drops of laudanum may be given in a gla&s;s of pepper mint, or &s;imple cinnamon water, to appea&s;e the irritation, and prevent the vomiting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>ACIDS have often a very happy effect in &s;taying the vo|miting, and appea&s;ing the other violent &s;ymptoms of this di&s;ea&s;e. It will, therefore, be of u&s;e to &s;harpen the pati|ent's drink with cream of tartar, juice of lemon; or, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en the&s;e cannot be obtained, a little vinegar may be add|ed to it.</P>
<P>BUT it often happens, that no liquid whatever will &s;tay on the &s;tomach. In this ca&s;e the patient mu&s;t take pur|gative pills. I have generally found the following an&s;wer very well. Take jalep in powder, and vitriolated tartar, each half a dram, opium, one grain, Ca&s;tile &s;oap, as much as will make the ma&s;s fit for pills. The&s;e mu&s;t be taken at one do&s;e, and if they do not operate in &s;ix or &s;even hours, the do&s;e may be repeated.</P>
<P>IF a &s;tool cannot be procured by any of the above means, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to immer&s;e the patient in warm water up to the brea&s;t. I have often &s;een this &s;ucceed, when other means proved in vain. The patient mu&s;t continue in the water as long as he can ea&s;ily bear it without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aint|ing, and, if one emer&s;ion does not &s;ucceed, it may be re|peated after &s;ome time, when the patient's &s;trength and &s;pirits are recruited. It is more &s;afe for him to go fre|quently into the bath, than continue too long at a time; and, it is often nece&s;&s;ary, to repeat it &s;everal times before it has the de&s;ired effect.</P>
<P>IT has &s;ometimes happened, after all other means of procuring a &s;tool had been tried in vain, that this was brought about by immer&s;ing the patient's lower extremities in cold water, making him walk upon a wet pavement, and da&s;hing his legs and thighs with the cold water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This
<PB N="206" REF="012338_0210_0F88EA2B36CA0FE0">
method, when others fail, at lea&s;t merits a trial. It is, indeed, attended with &s;ome danger; but a doubtful reme|dy is better than none.</P>
<P>IN de&s;perate ca&s;es it is common to give quick&s;ilver. This may be taken to the quantity of &s;everal ounces, or even a pound, but &s;hould not exceed that. When there are evident marks of an inflammation, or any rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect a mortification of the guts, this medicine ought not to be tried. In that ca&s;e, it will only ha&s;ten the patient's death. But when the ob&s;truction is occa&s;ioned by any cau&s;e that can be removed by force, quick&s;ilver is not only a proper medicine, but the be&s;t that can be applied, as it is the fitte&s;t body we know for making its way through the inte&s;tinal canal.</P>
<P>IF the di&s;ea&s;e proceeds from a rupture, the patient mu&s;t be laid with his head very low, and the inte&s;tines returned by gentle pre&s;&s;ure with the hand. If this, with fomenta|tions and cly&s;ters, &s;hould not &s;ucceed, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to a &s;urgical operation, which may give the patient re|lief.</P>
<P>SUCH as would avoid this excruciating and dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t take care never to be too long without a &s;tool. Some who have died of it, have had &s;everal pounds of hard, dry <HI>foeces</HI> taken out of their guts. They &s;hould, likewi&s;e, beware of eating too freely of &s;our or unripe fruits, or drinking &s;tale windy liquors, pricked wines, or the like. I have of|ten known it brought on by living too much on baked fruits, which are &s;eldom good. It likewi&s;e proceeds fre|quently from cold caught by wet cloaths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but e&s;pecial|ly from wet feet.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE COLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE colic has great affinity, both in its &s;ymptoms and method of cure, with the two preceding di&s;ea&s;es. It is generally attended with co&s;tivene&s;s and acute pain of the bowels; and requires diluting diet, evacuations, fomenta|tions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>COLICS are variou&s;ly denominated according to their cau&s;es, as the <HI>flatulent,</HI> the <HI>bilious,</HI> the <HI>hy&s;teric,</HI> the <HI>nervous, &amp;c.</HI> As each of the&s;e requires a particular treatment, we &s;hall point out their mo&s;t general &s;ymptoms, and the means to be u&s;ed for their relief.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="012338_0211_0F88EA2BB4D74C48">
THE <HI>flatulent,</HI> or wind colic, is generally occa&s;ioned by an indi&s;creet u&s;e of unripe fruits, meats of hard dige&s;tion, windy vegetables, fermented liquors, and &s;uch like. It may likewi&s;e proceed from an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, or catching cold. Delicate people, who&s;e dige&s;tive powers are weak and debilitated, are mo&s;t liable to this kind of colic.</P>
<P>THE flatulent colic may either affect the &s;tomach or in|te&s;tines. It is attended with a painful &s;tretching of the &s;tomach, or that part of the bowels where it is lodged. The patient feels a rumbling in his guts, and is generally relieved by a di&s;charge of wind either upwards or down|wards. The pain is &s;eldom confined to any particular part, as the vapour wanders from one divi&s;ion of the bowels to an other, till &s;uch time as it finds a vent.</P>
<P>WHEN the di&s;ea&s;e proceeds from windy liquor, eating green fruit, &s;our herbs, or the like, the be&s;t medicine is to take immediately a dram of brandy, gin, or any good &s;pi|rits, and to apply warm cloths to the &s;tomach and bowels. The patient &s;hould likewi&s;e &s;it with his feet upon a warm hearth &s;tone, or apply warm bricks to them; and he may drink camomile tea, or water gruel, with as much pepper in it as to render it moderately warm.</P>
<P>THIS is the only colic wherein ardent &s;pirits, &s;piceries, or any thing of a hot nature, may be ventured upon. Nor, indeed, are they to be u&s;ed here, unle&s;s at the beginning, before there be any &s;ymptoms of inflammation. We have rea&s;on to believe, that a colic occa&s;ioned by wind or fla|tulent food, might always be cured by &s;pirits and warm li|quors, if they were taken immediately upon perceiving the fir&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s; but when the pain has continued for a con|&s;iderable time, and there is rea&s;on to fear an inflammation of the bowels is already begun, all hot things are to be avoid|ed, and the patient is to be treated in the &s;ame manner as for the iliac pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>SEVERAL kinds of food, as honey, eggs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> occa&s;ion colics in &s;ome particular con&s;titutions. I have generally found the be&s;t cure for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e colics was to drink plentifully of &s;mall diluting liquors, as water gruel, &s;mall po&s;&s;et, toa&s;t and water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>COLICS which proceed from exce&s;s and indige&s;tions, ge|nerally cure them&s;elves, by occa&s;ioning vomiting or pur|ging. The&s;e di&s;charges are by no means to be &s;topped, but promoted, by drinking plenty of warm water, or weak
<PB N="208" REF="012338_0212_0F88EA2C6C4728C8">
po&s;&s;et. When their violence is over, the patient may take a do&s;e of rhubarb, or any other gentle purge, to carry off the dregs of his debauch.</P>
<P>COLICS which are occa&s;ioned by wet feet, or catching cold, may generally be removed at the beginning, by bathing the feet and legs in warm water, and drinking &s;uch warm diluting liquors as will promote the per&s;piration, as weak wine whey, or water gruel, with a &s;mall quantity of &s;pirits in it.</P>
<P>THESE flatulent colics, which prevail &s;o much in the country, might generally be prevented, if people were careful to change their cloaths when they get wet. They ought, likewi&s;e, to take a dram, or to drink &s;ome warm li|quor after eating any kind of green tra&s;h. We do not mean to recommend the practice of dram drinking, but, in this ca&s;e, ardent liquors prove a real medicine, and, in|deed, the be&s;t that can be applied.</P>
<P>THE <HI>bilious</HI> colic is attended with very acute pain about the region of the navel. The patient complains of great thir&s;t, and is generally co&s;tive. He vomits a hot, bitter, yellow coloured bile, which being di&s;charged, &s;eems to afford &s;ome relief, but is quickly followed by the &s;ame vi|olent pain as before. As the di&s;temper advances, the pro|pen&s;ity to vomit increa&s;es, in &s;o much, that &s;ometimes it becomes almo&s;t continual, and the proper motion of the inte&s;tines is &s;o far perverted, that there are all the &s;ymptoms of an impending iliac pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IF the patient be young and &s;trong, and the pul&s;e full and frequent, it will be proper to bleed, after which cly|&s;ters may be admini&s;tered. Clear whey, or gruel, &s;harp|ened with the juice of lemon, or cream of tartar, mu&s;t be drank freely. Small chicken broth, with a little manna di&s;&s;olved in it, or a &s;light decoction of tamarinds, are, like|wi&s;e, very proper, or any other thin, acid, opening li|quor.</P>
<P>BESIDES bleeding, and plentiful dilution, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to foment the belly with cloths dipped in warm water, and if this &s;hould not &s;ucceed, the patient mu&s;t be &s;et in a warm bath up to the middle.</P>
<P>MILD purgatives are here likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, as the leni|tive electuary, manna, cream of tartar, or, what will an|&s;wer very well, the bitter purging &s;alts. The&s;e may be di&s;&s;olved in water, and given in the &s;ame manner as direct|ed in page 205. If the&s;e medicines will not &s;tay on the
<PB N="209" REF="012338_0213_0F88EA2D2BE3EA88">
&s;tomach, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to join an opiate with them.</P>
<P>SUCH as are liable to frequent returns of the bilious colic &s;hould u&s;e fle&s;h &s;paringly, and live chiefly upon a light ve|getable diet. They &s;hould, likewi&s;e, take frequently a do&s;e of cream of tartar with tamarinds, or any other cool, acid purge.</P>
<P>THE <HI>hy&s;teric</HI> colic bears a great re&s;emblance to the bilious. It is attended with acute pains about the region of the &s;to|mach, vomiting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But what the patient vomits in this ca&s;e is commonly of a greeni&s;h colour. There is a great &s;inking of the &s;pirits, with dejection of mind, and difficul|ty of breathing, which are the characteri&s;tic &s;ymptoms of this di&s;order. Sometimes it is accompanied with the jaun|dice, but this generally goes off of its own accord in a few days.</P>
<P>IN this colic all evacuations, as bleeding, purging, vo|miting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do hurt. Every thing that weakens the pati|ent, or &s;inks the &s;pirits, is to be avoided. If, however, the vomiting &s;hould prove violent, weak camomile tea, or &s;mall po&s;&s;et, may be drank to clean&s;e the &s;tomach. After|wards the patient may take fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five drops of liquid laudanum in a gla&s;s of cinnamon water. This may be repeated every ten or twelve hours till the &s;ymptoms abate.</P>
<P>THE patient may likewi&s;e take four or five of the foetid pills, three times a-day, and drink a cup of pennyroyal tea after them. If a&s;afoetida &s;hould di&s;agree with the &s;tomach, which is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, a tea &s;poonful of the tincture of ca&s;tor in a cup of pennyroyal tea, or thirty or forty drops of the bal&s;am of Peru dropped upon a bit of loaf &s;ugar, may be taken in its &s;tead. The anti-hy&s;teric pla&s;ter may al&s;o be applied to the region of the navel, which has often a good effect.</P>
<P>THE <HI>nervous</HI> colic prevails mo&s;t among miners, &s;melters of lead, plumbers, the makers of white lead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is very difficult to cure, and often ends in a pal&s;y.</P>
<P>No di&s;ea&s;e of the bowels is attended with more excru|ciating pain than this. Nor is it &s;oon at an end. I have known it continue eight or ten days with very little inter|mi&s;&s;ion, the belly all the while continuing bound in &s;pite of medicine, yet at length yield, and the patient recover.</P>
<P>THE general treatment of this di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o nearly the &s;ame with that of the iliac pa&s;&s;ion, or inflammation of the guts, that we &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon it. The belly is to be
<PB N="210" REF="012338_0214_0F88EA2E221F7558">
opened by mild purgatives, given in &s;mall do&s;es, and fre|quently repeated, and their operation mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;oft oily cly&s;ters, fomentations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE Barbados tar is &s;aid to be a proper medicine in this di&s;ea&s;e. It may be taken to the quantity of two drams threetimes a-day, or oftener if the &s;tomach will bear it. This tar, mixed with an equal quantity of &s;trong rum, is likewi&s;e proper for rubbing the &s;pine, in ca&s;e any tingling, or other &s;ymptoms of a pal&s;y are felt. When this tar cannot be ob|tained, the back may be rubbed with &s;trong &s;pirits, or a little of the oil of nutmegs or ro&s;emary.</P>
<P>IF the patient remains weak and languid after this di&s;ea&s;e, he mu&s;t take exerci&s;e on hor&s;eback, and u&s;e an infu&s;ion of the Je&s;uits bark in wine. When the di&s;ea&s;e ends in a pal&s;y, the Bath waters are found to be extremely proper.</P>
<P>To avoid this colic, people mu&s;t &s;hun all &s;our fruits, acid and au&s;tere liquors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Tho&s;e who work in lead ought never to go to their bu&s;ine&s;s fa&s;ting, and their food &s;hould be oily or fat. They may take a gla&s;s of &s;allad oil, with a little brandy or rum every morning, but &s;hould ne|ver take &s;pirits alone. Liquid aliment is be&s;t for them; as fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> broths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but low living is bad. They &s;hould now and then go a little out of the tainted air; and &s;hould, at lea&s;t, take phy&s;ic every &s;pring and fall.</P>
<P>SUNDRY other kinds of this di&s;ea&s;e might be mentioned, but too many di&s;tinctions would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">end only to perplex and bewilder the reader. The&s;e already mentioned are the mo&s;t material, and &s;hould indeed be attended to, as their treat|ment is very different. But even tho&s;e who are not in a condition to di&s;tingui&s;h very accurately in the&s;e matters, may neverthele&s;s be of great &s;ervice to patients in colics, by only ob&s;erving the following general rules: Fir&s;t, To bathe the patient's feet and legs in warm water; and next, To apply bladders filled with warm water, or cloths dipped in it, to his &s;tomach and bowels. Afterwards, To make him drink freely of weak, diluting, warm liquors. And, la&s;tly, To give him an emollient cly&s;ter every two or three hours.</P>

<HEAD>INFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS.</HEAD>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;This di&s;ea&s;e may proceed from any of tho&s;e cau&s;es which produce an inflammatory fever. It is likewi&s;e occa&s;ioned by wounds, or brui&s;es of the kidneys, and by &s;mall &s;tones or gravel lodging within them. It may al&s;o proceed from &s;trong diuretic medicines; as &s;pirits of
<PB N="211" REF="012338_0215_0F88EA2EAB15F7E0">
turpentine, tincture of cantharides, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Violent motion, as hard riding or walking, e&s;pecially in hot weather, or whatever drives the blood forcibly into the kidneys, may occa&s;ion this malady. It may likewi&s;e proceed from lying too &s;oft, or too much on the back, or from involuntary contractions, or &s;pa&s;ms in the urinary ve&s;&s;els, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;There is a &s;harp pain about the region of the kidneys, with &s;ome degree of fever, and a &s;tu|por, or dull pain in the thigh of the affected &s;ide. The urine is at fir&s;t clear, and afterwards of a redi&s;h colour; but in the wor&s;t kind of the di&s;ea&s;e it generally continues pale, is pa&s;&s;ed with difficulty, and commonly &s;mall quantities at a time. The patient feels great unea&s;ine&s;s when he endea|vours to walk or &s;it upright. He lies with more ea&s;e on the affected &s;ide than on the &s;ound; and has generally a nau&s;ea or vomiting, re&s;embling that which happens in the colic.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e, however, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the colic by the pain being &s;eated farther back, and by the dif|ficulty of pa&s;&s;ing urine, which is a con&s;tant &s;ymptom of this di&s;ea&s;e, but does nor always happen in the other.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;Every thing of a heating or &s;ti|mulating nature is to be avoided. The food mu&s;t be thin and light; as water pap, &s;mall broths, with mild vegetables, and the like. Emollient and &s;oft liquors mu&s;t be plentifully drank; as clear whey, or balm tea &s;weetened with honey, decoctions of mar&s;h mallow roots, with barley and liquo|rice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The patient, notwith&s;tanding the vomiting, mu&s;t con&s;tantly keep &s;ipping &s;mall quantities of the&s;e or other diluting liquors. Nothing &s;o &s;afely and certainly abates the inflammation, and expels the ob&s;tructing cau&s;e, as co|pious dilution. The patient mu&s;t be kept ea&s;y, quiet, and free from cold, &s;o long as any &s;ymptoms of inflammation appear.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;Bleeding is here very nece&s;&s;ary, e&s;pecially at the beginning. Ten or twelve ounces may be let from the arm or foot with a lancet, and if the pain and inflammation continue, the operation may be repeated in twenty-four hours, e&s;pecially if the patient be of a full ha|bit. Leeches may likewi&s;e be applied to the haemorrhoidal veins, as a di&s;charge from the&s;e will greatly relieve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pa|tient.</P>
<P>CLOTHS dipped in warm water, or bladders <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> it, mu&s;t be applied to the part affected, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> grow cool. If the bladders be filled with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="212" REF="012338_0216_0F88EA31CE790848">
mallows and camomile flowers, to which a little &s;affron is added, and mixed with about a third part of new milk, it will be &s;till more beneficial.</P>
<P>EMOLLIENT cly&s;ters are likewi&s;e frequently to be admi|ni&s;tered; and if the&s;e do not open the belly, a little honey or manna may be added to them.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame cour&s;e is to be followed where gravel or a &s;tone is lodged in the kidney; but when the gravel or &s;tone is &s;eparated from the kidney, and lodges in any of the uri|nary pa&s;&s;ages, it will be proper, be&s;ides the fomentations, to rub the part with a little &s;weet oil, and to give gentle diu|retics; as juniper water &s;weetened with the &s;yrup of mar&s;h mallows, or a tea &s;poonful of the &s;weet &s;pirits of nitre, now and then in a cup of the patient's drink.

<HEAD>INFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER.</HEAD>
<P>THE inflammation of the bladder proceeds, in a great mea&s;ure, from the &s;ame cau&s;es as that of the kidneys. It is known by an acute pain towards the bottom of the belly,
<PB N="213" REF="012338_0217_0F88EA3270B5BDE8">
and difficulty of pa&s;&s;ing urine, with &s;ome degree of fever, a con&s;tant inclination to go to &s;tool, and a perpetual de&s;ire to make water.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t be treated on the &s;ame principles as the immediately preceding. The diet mu&s;t be light and thin, and the drink cooling and diluting. Bleeding is very proper at the beginning, and in robu&s;t con&s;titutions, it will often be nece&s;&s;ary to repeat it. The bottom of the belly mu&s;t be frequently fomented with warm water, or a decoc|tion of mild vegetables; and emollient cly&s;ters mu&s;t fre|quently be admini&s;tered, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE patient &s;hould ab&s;tain from every thing that is of a hot, acrid, and &s;timulating nature; and &s;hould live entirely upon &s;mall broths, gruels, or mild vegetables.</P>
<P>A &s;toppage of urine may proceed from other cau&s;es be|&s;ides an inflammation of the bladder; as a &s;welling of the haemorrhoidal veins, hard <HI>foeces</HI> lodged in the <HI>rectum;</HI> a &s;tone in the bladder, excre&s;cences in the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, a pal&s;y of the bladder, hy&s;teric affections, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Each of the&s;e requires a particular treatment, which does not fall under our con&s;ideration here.

Some per&s;ons have killed them|&s;elves by introducing probes into the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, to remove, as they thought, &s;omewhat that ob&s;tructed the pa&s;&s;age of the urine; and others have brought on a violent inflammation of the bladder, by u&s;ing &s;trong diuretics for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER.</HEAD>
<P>THE liver is le&s;s &s;ubject to inflammation than any of the other vi&s;cera, as, in it, the circulation is &s;lower; but when an inflammation does happen, it is with difficulty re|moved, and often ends in a &s;uppuration, or &s;chirrhous.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;Be&s;ides the common cau&s;es of inflam|mation, we may here reckon the following, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> exce&s;&s;ive fatne&s;s, a &s;chirrhous of the liver it&s;elf, violent &s;hocks from &s;trong vomits, when the liver was before un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound, an adu&s;t or atrabillarian &s;tate of the blood, any thing that &s;ud|denly cools the liver, after it has been greatly heated, &s;tones ob&s;tructing the cour&s;e of the bile, drinking &s;trong
<PB N="214" REF="012338_0218_0F88EA332D7538E8">
wines or &s;piritous liquors, u&s;ing hot &s;picy aliment, ob&s;tinate hypochondriacal di&s;tempers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;This di&s;ea&s;e is known by a painful tention of the right &s;ide under the fal&s;e ribs, attended with &s;ome degree of fever, a &s;en&s;e of weight, or fulne&s;s of the part, difficulty of breathing, loathing of food, great thir&s;t, with a pale or yellowi&s;h colour of the &s;kin and eyes.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;ymptoms</HI> here are various, according to the degree of inflammation, and likewi&s;e according to the particular part of the liver where the inflammation happens. Some|times the pain is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that an inflammation is not &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected; but when it happens in the up|per or convex part of the liver, the pain is more acute, the pul&s;e quicker, and the patient is often troubled with a dry cough, a hiccup, and a pain extending to the &s;houlder, with difficulty of lying on the left &s;ide, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the pleuri&s;y by the pain being le&s;s violent, &s;eated under the fal&s;e ribs, the pul&s;e not &s;o hard, and by the difficulty of lying on the left &s;ide. It may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the hy&s;teric and hypo|chondriac di&s;orders by &s;ome degree of fever, with which it is always attended.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e, if properly treated, is &s;eldom mortal. A con&s;tant hiccupping, violent fever, and exce&s;&s;ive thir&s;t, are very bad &s;ymptoms. If it ends in a &s;uppuration, and the matter cannot be brought to di&s;charge it&s;elf outwardly, the danger is great. When a &s;chirrhous of the liver en&s;ues, the patient, if he ob&s;erves a proper regimen, may live a num|ber of years tolerably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;y; but if he indulges in animal food and &s;trong liquors, or takes medicines of an acrid or irri|tating nature, the &s;chirrhous will be converted into a cancer, which mu&s;t infallibly prove fatal.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;The &s;ame regimen is to be ob|&s;erved in this as in other inflammatory di&s;orders. All hot things are to be carefully avoided, and cool re&s;olving li|quors, as whey, barley water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> drank freely. The food mu&s;t be light and thin, and the body, as well as the mind, mu&s;t be kept ea&s;y and quiet.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;Bleeding is proper at the begin|ning of this di&s;ea&s;e, and it will often be nece&s;&s;ary, even though the pul&s;e &s;hould not feel hard, to repeat the operati|on. The belly mu&s;t be kept gently open; but all violent purgatives are to be avoided. A decoction of tamarinds,
<PB N="215" REF="012338_0219_0F88EA33EFA4F5E0">
with a little honey or manna, will an&s;wer this purpo&s;e ve|ry well. The &s;ide affected mu&s;t be frequently fomented with warm water, in the manner directed in the foregoing di&s;ea&s;es. Mild laxative cly&s;ters &s;hould be frequently admi|ni&s;tered; and, if the pain &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding, con|tinue violent, a bli&s;tering pla&s;ter may be applied over the part affected.</P>
<P>MEDICINES which promote the &s;ecretion of urine, have a very good effect here. For this purpo&s;e, half a dram of purified nitre, or half a tea &s;poonful of the &s;weet &s;pirits of nitre, may be taken in a cup of the patient's drink, three or four times a-day.</P>
<P>WHEN there is an inclination to &s;weat, it ought to be promoted, but not by warm &s;udorifics. The only thing to be u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, is plenty of diluting liquor drank about the warmth of the human blood. Indeed, the patient, in this ca&s;e, as well as in all other topical inflammations, ought to drink nothing that is colder than the blood.</P>
<P>IF the &s;tools &s;hould be loo&s;e, and even &s;treaked with blood, nothing mu&s;t be given to &s;top them, unle&s;s they be &s;o frequent as to weaken the patient. Loo&s;e &s;tools often prove critical, and carry off the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>IF the di&s;order, in &s;pite of all endeavours to the contra|ry, &s;hould end in a &s;chirrhous, the patient mu&s;t be careful to regulate his diet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in &s;uch a manner as not to aggra|vate the di&s;ea&s;e. He mu&s;t not indulge in fle&s;h, fi&s;h, &s;trong liquors, or any poignant or &s;alted provi&s;ions; but mu&s;t, for the mo&s;t part, live on mild vegetables, as fruits and roots, taking gentle exerci&s;e, and drinking wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> water, or butter milk.

<P>WE &s;hall take no notice of inflammations of the other vi&s;cera. They mu&s;t all be treated upon the &s;ame princi|ples as tho&s;e already mentioned. The great rule, with re|&s;pect to all of them, is to avoid every thing that is &s;trong, or of a heating nature, to apply warm fomentations to the part affected, and to &s;upply the patient with plenty of weak, warm, diluting drink.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE CHOLERA MORBUS, OR VO|MITING AND LOOSENESS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a violent purging and vomiting, attended with gripes, and a con&s;tant de&s;ire to go to &s;tool. It comes on
<PB N="216" REF="012338_0220_0F88EA34B4400D88">
&s;uddenly, and is mo&s;t common in autumn. There is hard|ly any di&s;ea&s;e that kills more quickly than this, when proper means are not u&s;ed in due time for removing it.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;It is occa&s;ioned by a redundency and putrid acrimony of the bile; by food that ea&s;ily turns ran|cid or &s;our on the &s;tomach; as butter, fat pork, &s;weet meats, cucumbers, melons, cherries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is &s;ometimes the effect of &s;trong acrid purges or vomits; or of poi&s;on|ous &s;ub&s;tances taken into the &s;tomach. It may likewi&s;e proceed from violent pa&s;&s;ions of the mind; as fear, anger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;It is generally preceded by a <HI>cardialgia,</HI> or heart burn, &s;our belchings, and flatulences, with pain of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines. To the&s;e &s;ucceed exce&s;&s;ive vomiting, and purging of green, yellow, or black|i&s;h coloured bile, with a di&s;tention of the &s;tomach, and vi|olent griping pains. There is, likewi&s;e, a great thir&s;t, with a very quick unequal pul&s;e, and often a fixed acute pain about the region of the navel. As the di&s;ea&s;e advan|ces, the pul&s;e often &s;inks &s;o low as to become quite imper|ceptible, the extremities grow cold, or cramped, and co|vered with a clammy &s;weat, the urine is ob&s;tructed, and there is a palpitation of the heart. Violent hiccupping, fainting, and convul&s;ions, are the &s;igns of approaching death.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;At the beginning of this di&s;|ea&s;e, the efforts of nature to expel the offending cau&s;e, mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, by promoting the purging and vomiting. For this purpo&s;e the patient mu&s;t drink plenty of diluting liquors; as whey, butter milk, warm water, thin water gruel, &s;mall po&s;&s;et, or, what is, perhaps, preferable to any of them, very weak chicken broth. This &s;hould not only be drank freely, to promote the vomiting, but a cly&s;ter of it given every hour, in order to promote the purging.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e evacuations have been continued for &s;ome time, a decoction of toa&s;ted oat bread, may be drank to &s;top the vomiting. The bread &s;hould be toa&s;ted till it is of a brown colour, but not burned, and afterwards boiled in &s;pring water. If oat bread cannot be had, wheat bread, or oat meal, well toa&s;ted, may be u&s;ed in its &s;tead. If this does not put a &s;top to the vomiting, the &s;aline mixture may be taken, as directed in page 175.</P>
<P>THE vomiting and purging, however, ought never to be &s;topped too &s;oon. So long as the&s;e di&s;charges do not
<PB N="217" REF="012338_0221_0F88EA356CE7E150">
weaken the patient they are &s;alutary, and may be allowed to go on, or rather ought to be promoted. But when the patient is much exhau&s;ted by the evacuations, or has a &s;mall intermitting pul&s;e, coldne&s;s of the extremities, with other &s;ymptoms of weakne&s;s, recour&s;e mu&s;t immediately be had to opiates, and generous cordial medicines. Ten or fifteen drops of liquid laudanum in half a gla&s;s of &s;trong cinnamon water, may be taken every four or five hours, till the violent &s;ymptoms be removed. Warm negas, or &s;trong wine whey, may likewi&s;e be taken to &s;upport the patient's &s;pirits, and promote the per&s;piration. His legs may be rubbed with flannel cloths, or wrapped in warm blankets, and warm bricks applied to the &s;oles of his feet.</P>
<P>WHEN the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e is over, to prevent a relap&s;e, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, for &s;ome time, to continue the u&s;e of &s;mall do&s;es of laudanum. Ten or twelve drops may be taken in a gla&s;s of wine, at lea&s;t twice a-day, for eight or ten days. The patient's food ought to be nouri&s;hing, but taken in &s;mall quantities, and he &s;hould u&s;e moderate exerci&s;e. As the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines are generally much weakened, an infu&s;ion of the bark, or other bitters, in &s;mall wine may be drank for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>THOUGH phy&s;icians are &s;eldom called in due time in this di&s;ea&s;e, they ought not, however, to de&s;pair of relieving the patient, even in the mo&s;t de&s;perate circum&s;tances. Of this I lately &s;aw a very &s;triking in&s;tance in an old man and his &s;on, who had been both &s;eized with it about the middle of the night. I did not &s;ee them till next morning, when they had much more the appearance of dead than of living men. No pul&s;e could be felt; the extremities were quite cold and rigid; the countenance was gha&s;tly, and the &s;trength quite exhau&s;ted. Yet from this deplorable condition they were both recovered by the u&s;e of opiates and cordial medicines, with the regimen mentioned above.</P>

<HEAD>OF A DIARRHOEA, OR LOOSENESS.</HEAD>
<P>A loo&s;ene&s;s, in many ca&s;es, is not to be con&s;idered as a di&s;ea&s;e, but rather as a &s;alutary evacuation. It never ought to be &s;topped unle&s;s when it continues too long, or evidently weakens the patient. As this, however, &s;ome|times happens, we &s;hall point out the mo&s;t common cau&s;es of a loo&s;ene&s;s, with the method of treatment proper in each ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="012338_0222_0F88EA362B46A4D0">
WHEN a loo&s;ene&s;s is occa&s;ioned by catching cold, or an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, the patient ought to keep warm, to drink freely of weak diluting liquors, to bathe his feet and legs frequently in lukewarm water, to wear flannel next to his &s;kin, and to take every other method to re&s;tore the per&s;piration.</P>
<P>IN a loo&s;ene&s;s which proceeds from exce&s;s or repletion, a vomit is the proper medicine. Vomits not only clean the &s;tomach, but promote all the &s;ecretions, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">enders them of great importance in carrying off a debauch. Half a dram of ipecacuanha in powder will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e very well. A day or two after the vomit, the &s;ame quan|tity of rhubarb may be taken, and repeated two or three times, if the loo&s;ene&s;s continues. The patient ought to live upon light vegetable food, of ea&s;y dige&s;tion, and to drink whey, thin gruel, or ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ley water.</P>
<P>A loo&s;ene&s;s occa&s;ioned by the ob&s;truction of any cu&s;tom|ary evacuation, as the bleeding piles in men, the monthly di&s;charges in women, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> generally requires bleeding. If that does not &s;ucceed, other evacuations, as i&s;&s;ues, &s;etons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of tho&s;e which are ob|&s;tructed. At the &s;ame time, every method is to be taken to re&s;tore the u&s;ual di&s;charges, as not only the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e, but the patient's life may depend on this.</P>
<P>A periodical loo&s;ene&s;s ought never to be &s;topped. It is always an effort of nature to carry off &s;ome offending mat|ter, which, if retained in the body, might produce fatal di&s;ea&s;es. Children are very liable to this kind of loo&s;ene&s;s, e&s;pecially while teething. It is, however, &s;o far from be|ing hurtful to them, that &s;uch children generally get their teeth with lea&s;t trouble. If the&s;e loo&s;e &s;tools &s;hould at any time prove &s;our or griping, a tea &s;poonful of magne&s;ia alba, with four or five grains of rhubarb, may be given to the child in a little pap or any other food. This, if repeated three or four times, will generally correct the acidity, and carry off the griping &s;tools.</P>
<P>A diarrhoea, or loo&s;ene&s;s which proceeds from violent pa&s;&s;ions or affections of the mind, mu&s;t be treated with the greate&s;t caution. Vomits, in this ca&s;e, are highly improper. Nor are purges &s;afe, unle&s;s they be very mild, and given in &s;mall quantities. Opiates, and other anti&s;pa&s;|modic medicines are mo&s;t proper. Ten or twelve drops of liquid laudanum may be taken in a cup of valerian or pen|nyroyal tea, every eight or ten hours, till the &s;ymptoms
<PB N="219" REF="012338_0223_0F88EA3938CCBDB0">
abate. Ea&s;e, cheerfulne&s;s, and tranquillity of mind, are here of the greate&s;t importance.</P>
<P>WHEN a loo&s;ene&s;s proceeds from acrid or poi&s;onous &s;ub|&s;tances taken into the &s;tomach, the patient mu&s;t drink large quantities of diluting liquors, with oil or fat broths, to promote vomiting and purging. Afterwards, if the bowels are inflamed, bleeding will be nece&s;&s;ary. Small do|&s;es of laudanum may likewi&s;e be taken to remove the &s;pa&s;ms and the irritation of the bowels.</P>
<P>WHEN gouty matter, repelled from the extremities, oc|ca&s;ions a loo&s;ene&s;s, it is, by no means, to be &s;topped, but promoted by gentle do&s;es of rhubarb, or other mild purgatives. The gouty matter is likewi&s;e to be &s;olicited to the extremities by warm fomentations, and catapla&s;ms. And the per&s;piration ought to be promoted by warm diluting liquors; as wine whey, with &s;pirits of hart&s;horn, or a few drops of liquid laudanum in it.</P>
<P>WHEN a loo&s;ene&s;s proceeds from worms, &s;uch medi|cines ought to be u&s;ed as kill or carry off the&s;e vermin; as powder of tin, with purges of rhubarb and calomel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The proper do&s;es of the&s;e medicines will be pointed out when we come to treat of di&s;ea&s;es occa&s;ioned by worms.</P>
<P>A loo&s;ene&s;s is often occa&s;ioned by bad water. When this is the ca&s;e, the di&s;ea&s;e generally proves epidemical. When there is rea&s;on to believe that this, or any other di&s;ea&s;e, proceeds from the u&s;e of unwhole&s;ome water, it ought im|mediately to be changed, or, if that cannot be done, it may be corrected by mixing with it quicklime, chalk, or the like.</P>
<P>IN people who&s;e &s;tomachs are weak, violent exerci&s;e immediately after meals, will occa&s;ion a loo&s;ene&s;s. Though the cure of this is obvious, yet it will be proper, be&s;ides avoiding violent exerci&s;e, to u&s;e &s;uch medicines as tend to brace and &s;trengthen the &s;tomach; as infu&s;ions of the bark, with other bitter and a&s;tringent medicines, in white wine. The per&s;on ought, likewi&s;e, to take frequently a gla&s;s or two of old red port, or good claret.</P>
<P>PERSONS who, from a peculiar weakne&s;s, or too great an irritability of the bowels, are liable to frequent returns of this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;hould live temperately, avoiding crude &s;ummer fruits, all unwhole&s;ome food, and meats of hard dige&s;tion. They ought, likewi&s;e, to beware of cold, moi&s;ture, or whatever may ob&s;truct the per&s;piration, and &s;hould wear flannel next their &s;kin. All violent pa&s;&s;ions of

<HEAD>OF THE DYSENTERY, OR BLOODY-FLUX.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e prevails in the &s;pring and autumn. It is very infectious, and often epidemical. Tho&s;e per&s;ons are mo&s;t liable to it who are much expo&s;ed to the night air, or who live in places where the air is confined and unwhole|&s;ome. Hence it often proves fatal in camps, on &s;hipboard, in jails, ho&s;pitals, and &s;uch like places.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;This di&s;ea&s;e may be occa&s;ioned by any thing that ob&s;tructs the per&s;piration, or renders the hu|mours putrid; as damp beds, wet cloaths, unwhole&s;ome diet, air, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But it is mo&s;t frequently communicated by infection. This ought to make people extremely cautious in going near &s;uch per&s;ons as labour under the di&s;ea&s;e. Even the &s;mell of the patient's excrements has been known to communicate the infection.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;It is known by a flux of the belly, attended with a violent pain of the bowels, a con|&s;tant inclination to go to &s;tool, and generally le&s;s or more of blood in the &s;tools. It begins, like other fevers, with chill|ne&s;s, lo&s;s of &s;trength, a quick pul&s;e, great thir&s;t, and an inclinati|on to vomit. The &s;tools are at fir&s;t grea&s;y or frothy, afterwards they are &s;treaked with blood, and, at la&s;t, have frequently the appearance of pure blood, mixed with &s;mall filaments, or bits of &s;kin, which is part of the internal coat of the in|te&s;tines abraded by the acrimony of the foeces. Sometimes, however, there is no blood in the &s;tools through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. When the patient goes to &s;tool, he feels a bearing down, as if the whole bowels were falling out, and &s;ometimes a part of the inte&s;tine is actually pro|truded, which proves exceeding trouble&s;ome, e&s;pecially in children.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the diarrhoea, or loo&s;ene&s;s, by the acute pain of the bowels, and the blood which generally appears in the &s;tools. It may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the <HI>cholera morbus,</HI> by its not being attended with &s;uch violent and frequent fits of vomiting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the dy&s;entery attacks the old, the delicate, or &s;uch as have been wa&s;ted by &s;corbutic, con&s;umptive, or other lingering di&s;ea&s;es, it generally proves fatal. Vomiting and hiccupping are bad &s;igns, as they &s;hew an inflammation

of the &s;tomach. When the &s;tools have an exceeding di&s;a|greeable &s;mell, are green, black, or mixed with &s;mall glandular &s;ub&s;tances, or bits of &s;kin, the danger is great. It is an unfavourable &s;ymptom when cly&s;ters are immediate|ly returned; but &s;till more &s;o, when the pa&s;&s;age is &s;o ob&s;ti|nately &s;hut, that they cannot be injected. A weak pul&s;e, coldne&s;s of the extremities, with difficulty of &s;wallowing, and convul&s;ions, are &s;igns of approaching death.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;Nothing is of more impor|tance in this di&s;ea&s;e than cleanline&s;s. It contributes great|ly to the recovery of the patient, and no le&s;s to the &s;afety of &s;uch as attend him. In all contagious di&s;ea&s;es, the dan|ger is increa&s;ed, and the infection &s;pread, by the neglect of cleanline&s;s; but in none more than in this. Every thing about the patient &s;hould be frequently changed. The ex|crements &s;hould never be &s;uffered to continue in his cham|ber, but removed immediately, and buried under ground. A co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">nt &s;tream of fre&s;h air &s;hould be admitted into the chamber; and it ought frequently to be &s;prinkled with vi|negar, juice of lemon, or &s;ome other &s;trong acid.</P>
<P>THE patient mu&s;t not be di&s;couraged, but his &s;pirits kept up in hopes of a cure. Nothing tends more to render any putrid di&s;ea&s;e mortal than the fears and apprehen&s;ions of the &s;ick. All di&s;ea&s;es of this nature have a tendency to &s;ink and depre&s;s the &s;pirits, and, when that is increa&s;ed by fears and alarms, from tho&s;e whom the patient believes to be per&s;ons of &s;kill, it cannot fail to have the wor&s;t ef|fects.</P>
<P>A flannel ve&s;t worn next the &s;kin has often a very good effect in a dy&s;entery. This promotes the per&s;piration with|out greatly heating the body. Great caution, however, is nece&s;&s;ary in leaving it off. I have often known a dy&s;entery brought on by imprudently throwing off a flannel ve&s;t be|fore the &s;ea&s;on was &s;ufficiently hot. For, whatever pur|po&s;e this piece of dre&s;s be worn, it &s;hould never be left off but in a warm &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>IN this di&s;ea&s;e the greate&s;t attention mu&s;t be paid to the patient's diet. Fle&s;h, fi&s;h, and every thing that has a ten|dency to turn putrid or rancid on the &s;tomach, mu&s;t be ab&s;tained from. Apples boiled in milk, water pap, and plain light pudding, with broth made of the gelatinous parts of animals, may be eat. Jelly broth not only an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of food, but likewi&s;e of medicine. I have of|ten

Afterwards to boil them till the broth is quite a jelly. A little cinnamon or mace may be added, to give the broth an agreeable flavour, and the pa|tient may take a little of it warm, with toa&s;ted bread, three or four times a-day. A cly&s;ter of it may, likewi&s;e, be given twice a-day. Such as cannot u&s;e the broth made in this way, may have the head and feet &s;kinned; but we have rea&s;on to believe, that this hurts the medicine. It is not our bu&s;ine&s;s here to rea&s;on upon the nature and qualities of medicines, otherwi&s;e this might be &s;hewn to po&s;&s;e&s;s virtues every way &s;uited to the cure of a dy|&s;entery which does not proceed from a putrid &s;tate of the humours. One thing we know, which is preferable to all rea&s;oning, that whole families have often been cured by it, after they had u&s;ed many other medicines in vain. It will, however, be proper that the pati|ent take a vomit, and a do&s;e or two of rhubarb, before he begins to u&s;e the broth. It will, likewi&s;e, be nece&s;&s;ary to continue the u&s;e of it for a con&s;iderable time, and to make it the principal food.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ANOTHER kind of food very proper in the dy&s;entery, which may be u&s;ed by &s;uch as cannot take the broth men|tioned above, is made by boiling a few handfuls of fine flour, tied in a cloth, for &s;ix or &s;even hours, till it be|comes as hard as &s;tarch. Two or three table &s;poonfuls of this may be grated down, and boiled in &s;uch a quantity of new milk and water as to be of the thickne&s;s of pap. This may be &s;weetened to the patient's ta&s;te, and taken for his ordinary food<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">THE learned Dr. Rutherford, late profe&s;&s;or of medicine in the univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, u&s;ed to mention this medicine in his public lectures with great encomiums. He directed it to be made by tying three or four handfuls of the fine&s;t flour, as tight as po&s;&s;i|ble in a linen rag, afterwards to dip it frequently in water, and to dridge the out&s;ide with flour till a cake or cru&s;t be formed around it, which prevents the water from &s;oaking into it while boiling. It is then to be boiled till it becomes a hard dry ma&s;s, as directed above. This will not only an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of food, but may likewi&s;e be given in cly&s;ters.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE patient may likewi&s;e be allowed to eat freely of mo&s;t kinds of good ripe fruit; as apples, grapes, currant ber|ries, &s;trawberries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e may either be eat raw or boiled, with or without milk, as the patient choo&s;es. The prejudice again&s;t fruit in this di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o great, that many believe it to be the common cau&s;e of dy&s;enteries. This, however, is an egregious mi&s;take.

both for the prevention and cure of the mo&s;t dangerous kind of dy&s;entery. In a dy&s;entery ari&s;ing from a putrid &s;tate of humours, fruit is, in every re&s;pect, calculated to counteract that tendency to putrefaction, from whence all the danger proceeds. The patient, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, ought, therefore, to be allowed to eat as much fruit as he plea&s;es, provided it be good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I lately attended a young gentleman who had been &s;eized with a dy&s;entery in North America. All means had been tried for his relief, but to no purpo&s;e. At length, tired out with di&s;appoint|ments from medicine, and reduced to &s;kin and bone, he came over to Britain, rather with a view to die among his relations than with any hopes of a cure. After trying &s;undry medicines here, with no better &s;ucce&s;s than abroad, I advi&s;ed him to leave off the u&s;e of drugs, and to tru&s;t entirely to a diet of milk and fruits, with gentle exerci&s;e. Strawberries was the only fruit he could procure at that &s;ea&s;on. The&s;e he eat with milk twice, and, &s;ometimes, thrice a-day. The con&s;equence was, that, in a &s;hort time, his &s;tools were reduced from upwards of twenty in a day to three or four, and &s;ometimes not &s;o many. He u&s;ed the other fruits as they came in, and was, in a few weeks, &s;o well as to leave the part of the country where I was, with a view to return to America.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t proper drink in this di&s;order is whey. The dy&s;entery has often been cured by the u&s;e of clear whey alone. It may be taken both for drink, and in form of a cly&s;ter. When whey cannot be had, barley water, &s;harp|ened with cream of tartar, may be drank, or a decoction of barley and tamarinds; two ounces of the former, and one of the latter, may be boiled in two Engli&s;h quarts of water to one. Warm water, water gruel, or water where|in hot iron has been frequently quenched, are all very pro|per, and may be drank in turns. Camomile tea, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;tomach will bear it, is an exceeding proper drink. It both &s;trengthens the &s;tomach, and by its anti&s;eptic quality, tends to prevent a mortification of the bowels.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;At the beginning of this di&s;ea&s;e it is always nece&s;&s;ary to clean&s;e the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages. For this purpo&s;e, a vomit of ipecacuanha mu&s;t be given, and wrought off with weak camomile tea. Strong vomits are &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary here. A &s;cruple, or at mo&s;t half a dram of ipecacuanha, is generally &s;ufficient for an adult, and, &s;ometimes, a very few grains will &s;uffice. The day after the vomit, half a dram, or two &s;cruples of rhubarb, mu&s;t be taken. This do&s;e may be repeated every other day for two or three times. Afterwards &s;mall do&s;es of ipecacuanha
<PB N="224" REF="012338_0228_0F88EA3E8DDC5318">
may be taken for &s;ome time. Two or three grains of the powder may be mixed in a table &s;poonful of the &s;yrup of poppies, and taken three times a-day.</P>
<P>THESE evacuations, and the regimen pre&s;cribed above, will &s;eldom fail to perform the cure. Should it, however, happen otherwi&s;e, the following a&s;tringent medicines mu&s;t be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>A cly&s;ter of &s;tarch or fat mutton broth, with twenty or thirty drops of liquid laudanum in it, may be admini&s;tered twice a-day. At the &s;ame time, an ounce of gum Arabic, and half an ounce of gum tragacanth, may be di&s;&s;olved in an Engli&s;h pint of barley water, over a &s;low fire, and a table &s;poonful of it taken every hour.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e have not the de&s;ired effect, the patient may take four times a day, about the bulk of a nutmeg of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aponic confection,</HI> drinking after it a tea cupful of the decoction of logwood; which may be thus made: Boil three or four ounces of the &s;havings of logwood in two Engli&s;h quarts of water to one; towards the end, add two drams of cinna|mon bark. This decoction gives the &s;tools a reddi&s;h co|lour, which is &s;ometimes mi&s;taken for blood. We menti|on this circum&s;tance to prevent the patient from being alarmed at their appearance.</P>
<P>SOME have treated dy&s;enteries very &s;ucce&s;sfully, by giv|ing the patient white wax di&s;&s;olved in milk. Others extol the virtues of the <HI>Corne&s;&s;i</HI> root, the <HI>Simaruba</HI> bark, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e. When other medicines fail, the&s;e &s;trong a&s;tringents may be tried; but we hope they will &s;eldom be found nece&s;&s;ary. At any rate, a&s;trin|gent, or binding medicines, never are to be u&s;ed till proper evacuations have been premi&s;ed, otherwi&s;e they will fix the di&s;ea&s;e in&s;tead of removing it.</P>
<P>PERSONS who have been cured of this di&s;ea&s;e are very li|able to a relap&s;e; to prevent which, great circum&s;pection with re&s;pect to diet is nece&s;&s;ary. The patient mu&s;t ab&s;tain from all fermented liquors, except now and then a gla&s;s of good wine; but he mu&s;t drink no kind of malt liquor. He mu&s;t, likewi&s;e, ab&s;tain from animal food, as fi&s;h and fle&s;h, and mu&s;t live principally upon milk and vegetables.</P>
<P>GENTLE exerci&s;e, and whole&s;ome air, are likewi&s;e of importance. The patient &s;hould go to the country as &s;oon as his &s;trength will permit, and &s;hould take exerci&s;e daily on hor&s;eback, or in a machine. He may, likewi&s;e, u&s;e bitters infu&s;ed in wine or brandy, and may drink twice
<PB N="225" REF="012338_0229_0F88EA3F2DE95F48">
a-day a gill of lime water, mixed with an equal quantity of new milk.</P>
<P>WHEN dy&s;enteries prevail, we would recommend a &s;trict attention to cleanline&s;s, a &s;pare u&s;e of animal food, and the free u&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound ripe fruits, and other vegetables. The night air is to be carefully avoided, and all commu|nication with the &s;ick. Bad &s;mells are likewi&s;e to be &s;hun|ned, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which ari&s;e from putrid animal &s;ub&s;tances. The office hou&s;es where the &s;ick go are very dangerous. Nothing is more apt to occa&s;ion the di&s;ea&s;e than being greatly afraid of it.</P>
<P>WHEN the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of the dy&s;entery appear, the patient ought immediately to take a vomit, to go to bed, and drink plentifully of weak, warm liquor, to promote a &s;weat. This, with a do&s;e or two of rhubarb, would often carry off the di&s;ea&s;e at the beginning. In countries where dy&s;enteries prevail, we would advi&s;e &s;uch as are liable to them, to take either a vomit or a do&s;e of phy&s;ic every &s;pring and autumn, as a preventive.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;undry other fluxes of the belly, as the <HI>lien|tery</HI> and <HI>coeliac pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> which, though le&s;s dangerous than the dy&s;entery, yet merit con&s;ideration. The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es ge|nerally proceed from a relaxed &s;tate of the &s;tomach and in|te&s;tines, which is &s;ometimes &s;o great, that the food pa&s;&s;es through them, without almo&s;t any &s;en&s;ible alteration; and the patient dies merely from the want of nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>WHEN the lientary or coeliac pa&s;&s;ion &s;ucceed a dy&s;entery, they often prove fatal. They are always dangerous in old age, e&s;pecially when the con&s;titution has been broken by exce&s;s, or acute di&s;ea&s;es. If the &s;tools be very frequent, and quite crude, the thir&s;t great, with little urine, the mouth ulcerated, and the face marked with &s;pots of diffe|rent colours, the danger is very great.</P>
<P>THE treatment of the patient is in general the &s;ame as in the dy&s;entery. In all ob&s;tinate fluxes of the belly, from whatever cau&s;e, the cure mu&s;t be attempted, by fir&s;t clean|ing the &s;tomach and bowels with gentle vomits and purges. Afterwards, &s;uch a diet as has a tendency to brace and &s;trengthen the bowels, with opiates and a&s;tringent medi|cines, will generally perfect the cure.</P>
<P>THIS ob&s;ervation, likewi&s;e, holds with re&s;pect to a <HI>tene&s;|mus,</HI> or frequent de&s;ire of going to &s;tool. It re&s;embles the dy&s;entery &s;o much, both in its &s;ymptoms and method of cure, that we think it needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t upon it.</P>

<HEAD>OF A DIABETES, OR EXCESSIVE DISCHARGE OF URINE.</HEAD>
<P>THE diabetes may be called a flux of the kidneys. It is &s;eldom to be met with among young people; but I have often known it happen to labourers in the decline of life, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who followed the more violent employ|ments, and who had been hard drinkers in their youth.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;A diabetes is often the con&s;equence of acute di&s;ea&s;es, as fevers, fluxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where the patient has &s;uffered exce&s;&s;ive evacuations; it may al&s;o be occa&s;ion|ed by exce&s;&s;ive fatigue, as riding long journies upon a hard trotting hor&s;e, carrying heavy burdens, running, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It may be brought on by the u&s;e of &s;trong &s;timulating diuretic medicines, as tincture of cantharides, &s;pirits of turpentine, and &s;uch like. It is often the effect of drinking large quantities of mineral waters. Many imagine that the&s;e will do them no &s;ervice unle&s;s they be drank in large quan|tities, by which mi&s;take it happens, that they often occa&s;i|on wor&s;e di&s;ea&s;es than tho&s;e they were taken to cure. In a word, this di&s;ea&s;e may either proceed from too great a laxi|ty of the organs which &s;ecrete the urine, from &s;omething that &s;timulates the kidneys too much, or from a thin di&s;|&s;olved &s;tate of the blood, which makes too great a quan|tity of it run off by the urinary pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;In a diabetes the urine gene|rally exceeds in quantity all the liquid food and drink which the patient takes. It is thin and pale, of a &s;weeti&s;h ta&s;te, and an agreeable &s;mell. The patient has a continu|al thir&s;t, with &s;ome degree of fever; his mouth is dry, and he &s;pits frequently a frothy &s;pittle. The &s;trength fails, the appetite decays, and the fle&s;h wa&s;tes away, till the pa|tient is reduced to &s;kin and bone. There is a heat of the bowels; and frequently the loins, te&s;ticles, and feet are &s;welled.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e may be cured at the beginning; but, after it has continued long, the cure becomes very difficult. In drunkards, and very old people, a cure is not to be ex|pected.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;Every thing that &s;timulates the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, or tends to relax the habit, mu&s;t be avoided. The patient &s;hould live chiefly on &s;olid food. His thir&s;t may be quenched with acids, or &s;orrel, juice of lemon, or vinegar. The mucilaginous vegetables, as rice, &s;ago,
<PB N="227" REF="012338_0231_0F88EA40ADE0B870">
and &s;alop, with milk, are the mo&s;t proper food. Of ani|mal &s;ub&s;tances, &s;hell-fi&s;h are to be preferred, as oy&s;ters, crabs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE drink may be Bri&s;tol water. When that cannot be obtained, lime water with milk may be drank. This will be better if an ounce of gum Arabic be di&s;&s;olved in every pound of it. The white decoction, with i&s;ingla&s;s di&s;&s;olved in it, is likewi&s;e a very proper drink. It is made by boiling two ounces of calcined hart&s;horn, and half an ounce of gum Arabic, in three Engli&s;h pints of water to two, and afterwards &s;training it.</P>
<P>THE patient ought daily to take exerci&s;e, but it &s;hould be &s;o gentle as not to fatigue him. He &s;hould lie upon a hard bed or matre&s;s. Nothing hurts the kidneys more than ly|ing too &s;oft. A warm dry air, the u&s;e of the fle&s;h bru&s;h, and every thing that promotes per&s;piration, is of &s;ervice. For this rea&s;on, the patient ought to wear flannel next his &s;kin. A large &s;trengthening pla&s;ter may be applied to the back; or, what will an&s;wer the &s;ame end, a broad girdle may be worn about the loins.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;Gentle purges, if the pati|ent be not too much weakened by the di&s;ea&s;e, have a good effect. They tend to promote a flux of the humours towards the inte&s;tines, and, of cour&s;e, to le&s;&s;en the di&s;charge by the kidneys. They may con&s;i&s;t of rhubarb, with cardamum &s;eeds, or any other &s;piceries, infu&s;ed in wine, and may be taken in &s;uch quantities as to keep the belly gently open.</P>
<P>THE patient mu&s;t next have recour&s;e to a&s;tringents and corroborants. Half a dram of powder, made of equal parts of allum and the gum called <HI>dragon's blood,</HI> may be taken four times a-day, or oftener if the &s;tomach will bear it. The allum mu&s;t fir&s;t be melted in a crucible; afterwards they may both be pounded together. Along with every do&s;e of this powder the patient may take a tea cupful of the tinc|ture of ro&s;es. It is made by infu&s;ing in a &s;tone ware ve&s;&s;el, for four hours, an ounce of the dried leaves of red ro&s;es, with one dram of &s;pirit of vitriol, in two Engli&s;h pints of boiling water. Afterwards the tincture may be filtered, and four or five ounces of white &s;ugar added to it.</P>
<P>IF the patient's &s;tomach cannot bear the allum in &s;ub|&s;tance, whey may be made of it, and taken in the do&s;e of three or four ounces three times a-day. The allum whey is prepared by boiling two Engli&s;h quarts of milk over a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low
<PB N="228" REF="012338_0232_0F88EA416FD0C8A0">
fire, with three drams of allum, till it be turned into whey.</P>
<P>OPIATES are of &s;ervice in this di&s;ea&s;e, even though the patient re&s;ts well. They take off &s;pa&s;ms and irritation, and, at the &s;ame time, le&s;&s;en the force of the circulation. Ten or twelve drops of liquid laudanum may be taken in a cup of the patient's drink two or three times a-day.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t corroborants which we know, are the Je&s;uits bark and wine. A dram of bark may be taken in a gla&s;s of red port or claret, three times a-day. The medicine will be more efficacious and le&s;s di&s;agreeable, if fifteen or twenty drops of the acid elixir of vitriol be added to every do&s;e. Such as cannot take the bark in &s;ub&s;tance, may u&s;e the decoction, mixed with an equal quantity of red wine, and &s;harpened as above.</P>
<P>THERE is a di&s;ea&s;e pretty incident to labouring people in the decline of life, called an <HI>incontinency of urine.</HI> This differs intirely from a diabetes, as the water pa&s;&s;es off invo|luntarily by drops, and does not exceed the u&s;ual quantity. This di&s;ea&s;e is rather trouble&s;ome than dangerous. It is owing to a relaxation of the &s;pincter of the bladder, and is often the effect of a pal&s;y. Sometimes it proceeds from hurts, or injuries occa&s;ioned by blows, brui&s;es, preternatural la|bours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Sometimes it is the effect of a fever. It may, likewi&s;e, be occa&s;ioned by a long u&s;e of &s;trong diu|retics, or of &s;timulating medicines, injected into the blad|der.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e may be mitigated by the u&s;e of a&s;tringent and corroborating medicines, &s;uch as have been mentioned above; but we do not remember ever to have &s;een it cured.</P>

<HEAD>OF A SUPPRESSION OF URINE.</HEAD>
<P>IT has already been ob&s;erved, that a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine may proceed from various cau&s;es; as an inflammation of the kidneys, or bladder; &s;mall &s;tones or gravel lodged in the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, hard foeces lying in the <HI>rectum,</HI> a &s;pa&s;m, or contraction of the neck of the bladder, clotted blood in the bladder, a &s;welling of the haemorrhoidal veins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>SOME of the&s;e ca&s;es require the cathater, both to remove the ob&s;tructing matter, and to draw off the urine; but as this in&s;trument can only be managed with &s;afety by per&s;ons &s;killed in &s;urgery, we &s;hall &s;ay nothing further of its u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="012338_0233_0F88EA43A36E1D38">
WE would chiefly recommend, in all ob&s;tructions of urine, fomentations and evacuations. If the patient be young, of a full habit, and if his pul&s;e be hard, frequent bleeding will be nece&s;&s;ary, e&s;pecially where there are &s;ymp|toms of a topical inflammation. Bleeding, in this ca&s;e, not only abates the fever, by le&s;&s;ening the force of the circula|tion, but by relaxing the &s;olids, takes off the &s;pa&s;m, or &s;tricture upon the ve&s;&s;els, which occa&s;ioned the ob&s;tructi|on.</P>
<P>AFTER bleeding, fomentations mu&s;t be u&s;ed.

Some put the herbs them|&s;elves into a flannel bag, and apply them to the part, which is far from being a bad method. The&s;e continue longer warm than cloths dipped in the decoction, and, at the &s;ame time, keep the part equally moi&s;t.</P>
<P>IN all ob&s;tructions of urine, the belly ought to be kept open. This is not, however, to be attempted by bri&s;k purgatives, but by emollient cly&s;ters, or gentle infu&s;ions of &s;enna and manna. Cly&s;ters, in this ca&s;e, not only open the belly, but an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of an internal fomentati|on, and greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t in removing &s;pa&s;ms of the bladder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE food mu&s;t be light, and taken in &s;mall quantities. The drink may be weak broth, or decoctions and infu&s;ions of mucilaginous vegetables, as mar&s;h mallow roots, lime tree buds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A tea &s;poonful of the &s;weet &s;pirits of nitre, or a dram of Ca&s;tile &s;oap, may be frequently put into the patient's drink; and, if there be no inflammation, he may drink &s;mall gin punch, without acid.</P>
<P>IN a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine, nature often attempts to re|lieve the patient by a &s;weat, loo&s;ene&s;s, &s;pitting, gulping up of clear water from the &s;tomach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e di&s;charges ought not to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, but encouraged, as the patient's life often depends upon them.</P>
<P>PERSONS &s;ubject to a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine, ought to live very temperate. Their diet &s;hould be light, and their li|quor diluting.

<HEAD>OF COSTIVENESS.</HEAD>
<P>NO per&s;on can long enjoy good health, who does not go regularly to &s;tool. There is, however, a very great dif|ference of per&s;ons in this re&s;pect, &s;ome being able to bear co&s;tivene&s;s much longer than others.

<P>COSTIVENESS may proceed from an exce&s;&s;ive heat of the liver; drinking rough red wines, or other a&s;tringent li|quors; too much exerci&s;e, e&s;pecially on hor&s;eback: It may, likewi&s;e, proceed from a long u&s;e of cold in&s;ipid food, which does not &s;ufficiently &s;timulate the inte&s;tines. Sometimes it is owing to the bile not de&s;cending to the in|te&s;tines, as in the jaundice; and, at other times, it pro|ceeds from di&s;ea&s;es of the inte&s;tines them&s;elves, as a pal&s;y, &s;pa&s;ms, tumours, a cold dry &s;tate of the inte&s;tines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN co&s;tivene&s;s is con&s;titutional, it may be borne a long time without any bad effects; but when it proceeds from an inflammation or tumour in the inte&s;tines, it is dan|gerous.

I never knew any one get into a habit of taking medicine for keeping the belly open, who could leave it off.

<P>WHEN the belly cannot be kept open without medicine, we would recommend gentle do&s;es of rhubarb to be taken twice or thrice a-week.

<HEAD>OF INVOLUNTARY DISCHARGES OF BLOOD.</HEAD>
<P>SPONTANEOUS, or involuntary di&s;charges of blood, of|ten happen from various parts of the body. They are &s;el|dom, however, attended with great danger, and prove of|ten &s;alutary. When &s;uch di&s;charges are critical, which is frequently the ca&s;e i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> fevers, they ought not to be &s;topped. Nor, indeed, is it proper, at any time, to &s;top them, unle&s;s they be &s;o great as to endanger the patient's life. Mo&s;t people, afraid of the &s;malle&s;t appearance of blood from any part of the body, fly immediately to the u&s;e of &s;tiptic and a&s;tringent medicines, by which means an inflammation of the brain, or &s;ome other fatal di&s;ea&s;e, is occa&s;ioned, which, had the di&s;charge been allowed to go on, might have been prevented.</P>
<P>PERIODICAL di&s;charges of blood, from whatever part of the body they proceed, mu&s;t not be &s;topped. The&s;e are always the efforts of nature to relieve her&s;elf, and fatal di&s;ea&s;es have often been the con&s;equence of ob&s;tructing them. It may, indeed, be &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to check the violence of &s;uch di&s;charges; but even this requires the greate&s;t caution. In&s;tances may be given where the &s;top|ping of a &s;mall periodical flux of blood, from one of the fingers, has proved fatal to the per&s;on's health.</P>
<P>IN the early period of life, bleeding at the no&s;e is mo&s;t common. Tho&s;e who are farther advanced in life, are more liable to a haemoptoe, or di&s;charge of blood from the lungs. After the middle period of life, haemorrhoidal fluxes are mo&s;t common, and in the decline of life, di&s;|charges of blood from the urinary pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>INVOLUNTARY fluxes of blood may proceed from very different, and often from quite oppo&s;ite cau&s;es. Some|times they are hereditary, or owing to a particular con|&s;truction of the body, as a &s;anguine temperament, a lax or plethoric habit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Sometimes they proceed from a deter|mination of the blood towards one particular part, as the head, the haemorrhoidal veins. They may likewi&s;e proceed from an inflammatory di&s;po&s;ition of the blood, in which ca&s;e, there is generally &s;ome degree of fever; this, like|wi&s;e, happens when the flux is occa&s;ioned by an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, or a &s;tricture upon the &s;kin, the bowels, or any particular part of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="012338_0237_0F88EA476EB371C0">
BUT a di&s;&s;olved &s;tate of the blood will, likewi&s;e, occa|&s;ion haemorrhages. Thus, in putrid fevers, the &s;curvy, the malignant &s;mall-pox, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there are often very great di&s;charges of blood from different parts of the body. They may, likewi&s;e, be brought on by the u&s;e of any medicines which tend to di&s;&s;olve the blood, as mercury, cantharides, and the volatile alcaline &s;alts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Food of an acrid or ir|ritating quality, may, likewi&s;e, occa&s;ion haemorrhages; as al&s;o &s;trong purges and vomits, or any thing that greatly &s;ti|mulates the bowels.</P>
<P>VIOLENT pa&s;&s;ions, or agitations of the mind, will al&s;o occa&s;ion haemorrhages. The&s;e often cau&s;e bleeding at the no&s;e, and I have known them &s;ometimes occa&s;ion an haemorrhage in the brain. Violent efforts of the body, by over&s;training or hurting the ve&s;&s;els, may, likewi&s;e, bring on haemorrhages, e&s;pecially when the body is long kept in an unnatural po&s;ture, as hanging the head very low, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE cure of an haemorrhage mu&s;t be adapted to its cau&s;e. When it proceeds from too much blood, or a tendency to inflammation, bleeding, with gentle purges, and other eva|cuations, will be nece&s;&s;ary. It will, likewi&s;e, be proper for the patient, in that ca&s;e, to live chiefly upon a vegeta|ble diet, to avoid all &s;trong liquors, and food that is of an acrid, hot, or &s;timulating quality. The body &s;hould be kept cool, and the mind ea&s;y.</P>
<P>WHEN an haemorrhage is owing to a putrid or di&s;&s;olved &s;tate of the blood, the patient ought to live chiefly upon acid fruits with milk, and vegetables of a nouri&s;hing na|ture, as &s;ago, &s;alop, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> His drink may be wine diluted with water, and &s;harpened with the juice of lemon, vinegar, or &s;pirits of vitriol. The be&s;t medicine, in this ca&s;e, is the Je&s;uits bark. It may be taken as directed in page 228.</P>
<P>WHEN a flux of blood is the effect of acrid food, or of &s;trong &s;timulating medicines, the cure is to be effected by &s;uch &s;oft and mucilaginous diet as is recommended in the dy&s;entery or bloody-flux. The patient may, likewi&s;e, take frequently about the bulk of a nutmeg of Locatelli's bal|&s;am, or the &s;ame quantity of &s;permaceti.</P>
<P>WHEN an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, or a &s;tricture upon any part of the &s;y&s;tem, is the cau&s;e of an haemorrhage, it may be removed by drinking warm diluting liquors, lying in bed, bathing the extremities in warm water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OF BLEEDING AT THE NOSE.</HEAD>
<P>A bleeding at the no&s;e is commonly preceded by &s;ome degree of quickne&s;s of the pul&s;e, a flu&s;hing of the face, pul|&s;ation of the temporal arteries, heavine&s;s in the head, dim|ne&s;s of the &s;ight, heat and itching of the no&s;trils, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>TO per&s;ons who abound with blood, this di&s;charge is very &s;alutary. It often cures a vertigo, the headach, a phrenzy, and even an epilep&s;y. In fevers, where there is a great determination of blood towards the head, it is of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice. It is, likewi&s;e, beneficial in inflammations of the liver and &s;pleen, and often in the gout and rheuma|ti&s;m. In all di&s;ea&s;es where evacuations are nece&s;&s;ary, a &s;pontaneous di&s;charge of blood from the no&s;e, is of much more &s;ervice than the &s;ame quantity let with a lancet.</P>
<P>IN a di&s;charge of blood from the no&s;e, the great point is, to determine whether it ought to be &s;topped or not. It is a common practice to &s;top the bleeding without con&s;idering whether it be a di&s;ea&s;e, or the cure of a di&s;ea&s;e. This con|duct proceeds from fear; but it has many bad, and &s;ome|times even fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>WHEN a di&s;charge of blood from the no&s;e happens in an inflammatory di&s;ea&s;e, there is always rea&s;on to believe, that it may prove &s;alutary; and, therefore, it &s;hould be &s;uf|fered to go on, at lea&s;t as long as the patient &s;eems to bear it well.</P>
<P>WHEN it happens to per&s;ons in perfect health, who are full of blood, it ought not to be &s;topped; e&s;pecially if the &s;ymptoms of a plethora, mentioned above, have pre|ceded it. In this ca&s;e, it cannot be &s;topped without ri&s;king the patient's life.</P>
<P>IN fine, whenever bleeding at the no&s;e relieves any bad &s;ymptom, and does not proceed &s;o far as to endanger the patient's life, it ought not to be &s;topped. But when it re|turns frequently, or continues till the pul&s;e becomes very low, the extremities begin to grow cold, the lips pale, or the patient complains of being &s;ick, or like to faint, it mu&s;t immediately be &s;topped.</P>
<P>THE patient &s;hould be &s;et nearly upright, with his head inclining a little backwards, and his legs immer&s;ed in wa|ter about the warmth of new milk. His hands ought, like|wi&s;e, to be put in lukewarm water, and his garters may be tied a little tighter than u&s;ual, about three inches above the knee. Ligatures may, likewi&s;e, be applied to the arms,
<PB N="235" REF="012338_0239_0F88EA4B71BF90B0">
about the place where they are u&s;ually made for bleeding, and with nearly the &s;ame degree of tightne&s;s. The&s;e mu&s;t be gradually &s;lackened as the blood begins to &s;top, and re|moved intirely as &s;oon as it gives over.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES, dry lint put up the no&s;trils will &s;top the bleeding. When this does not &s;ucceed, do&s;&s;ils of lint dipped in &s;trong &s;pirits of wine, may be put up the no&s;trils, or, if that cannot be had, they may be dipped in brandy. Roman vitriol di&s;&s;olved in water may, likewi&s;e, be u&s;ed for this pur|po&s;e, or a tent dipped in the white of an egg well beat up, may be rolled in a powder made of equal parts of white &s;u|gar, burnt allum, and white vitriol, and put up the no&s;tril from whence the blood i&s;&s;ues.</P>
<P>INTERNAL medicines can hardly take place here, as they have &s;eldom time to operate. It may not, however, be ami&s;s to give the patient half an ounce of Glauber's &s;alt, and the &s;ame quantity of manna, di&s;&s;olved in four or five ounces of barley water. This may be taken at a draught, and repeated if it does not operate in a few hours. Ten or twelve grains of nitre may be taken in a gla&s;s of cold water and vinegar every hour, or oftener, if the &s;tomach will bear it. If a &s;tronger medicine be nece&s;&s;ary, a tea cupful of the tincture of ro&s;es, made as directed in page 227, with twen|ty or thirty drops of the &s;mall &s;pirit of vitriol, may be taken every hour. When the&s;e things cannot be had, the patient may drink water, with a little common &s;alt in it, or equal parts of water and vinegar.</P>
<P>IF the genitals be immer&s;ed in cold water, it will gene|rally &s;top a bleeding at the no&s;e.&mdash;I have never known this fail.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES, when the blood is &s;topped outwardly, it continues to bleed inwardly. This is very dangerous, and requires particular attention, as the patient is apt to be &s;uf|focated with the blood, e&s;pecially if he falls a&s;leep, which be is very ready to do after lo&s;ing a great quantity of blood.</P>
<P>AFTER the bleeding is &s;topped, the patient ought to be kept as ea&s;y and quiet as po&s;&s;ible. He ought not to pick his no&s;e, nor to take away the tents or clotted blood, till they fall off of their own accord, and &s;hould not lie with his head too low.</P>
<P>THOSE who are affected with frequent bleeding at the no&s;e, ought to bathe their feet often in warm water, and keep them warm and dry. They ought to wear nothing tight about their necks, to keep their body as much in an erect po&s;ture as po&s;&s;ible, and never to view any object

obliquely. If they have too much blood, a vegetable diet, with now and then a do&s;e of phy&s;ic, is the &s;afe&s;t way to le&s;&s;en it.</P>
<P>BUT when the di&s;ea&s;e proceeds from a thin di&s;&s;olved &s;tate of the blood, the diet &s;hould be rich and nouri&s;hing; as &s;trong broths with bread, &s;ago gruel with wine and &s;u|gar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Infu&s;ions of the Je&s;uits bark in wine, ought like|wi&s;e to be taken, and per&s;i&s;ted in for a con&s;iderable time.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE BLEEDING AND BLIND PILES.</HEAD>
<P>A di&s;charge of blood from the haemorrhoidal ve&s;&s;els is called the <HI>bleeding piles.</HI> When the ve&s;&s;els only &s;well, and di&s;charge no blood, but are exceeding painful, the di&s;ea&s;e is called the <HI>blind piles.</HI></P>
<P>PERSONS of a loo&s;e &s;pungy texture, of a bulky &s;ize, who live high, and lead a &s;edentary and inactive life, are mo&s;t &s;ubject to this di&s;ea&s;e. It is often owing to a hereditary di&s;po&s;ition. Where this is the ca&s;e, it attacks per&s;ons more early in life than when it is accidental. Men are more liable to it than women, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a &s;anguine plethoric habit, or of a melancholy di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE piles may be occa&s;ioned by an exce&s;s of blood, by &s;trong aloetic purges, high &s;ea&s;oned food, drinking great quantities of &s;weet wines, the neglect of bleeding, or other cu&s;tomary evacuations, much riding, great co&s;tivene&s;s, or any thing that occa&s;ions hard or difficult &s;tools. Anger, grief, and other violent pa&s;&s;ions, will likewi&s;e occa&s;ion the piles. I have often known them brought on by cold, e&s;pe|cially about the <HI>anus.</HI> A pair of thin breeches will occa&s;ion the di&s;order in a per&s;on who is &s;ubject to it, and &s;ometimes even in tho&s;e who never had it before. Pregnant women are often afflicted with the piles.</P>
<P>A flux of blood from the <HI>anus</HI> is not always to be reckon|ed a di&s;ea&s;e. It is even more &s;alutary than bleeding at the no&s;e, and often prevents or carries off di&s;ea&s;es. It is pecu|liarly beneficial in the gout, rheumati&s;m, a&s;thmas, and hy|pochondriacal complaints, and often proves critical in co|lics, and inflammatory fevers.</P>
<P>IN the treatment of this di&s;ea&s;e, regard mu&s;t be had to the patient's habit of body, his age, &s;trength, and manner of living.

It is often occa&s;ioned by exce&s;&s;ive drinking, running, wre&s;tling, &s;inging, or &s;peaking aloud. Such as have weak lungs ought to avoid all violent exertions of that organ, as they value life. They &s;hould, likewi&s;e guard again&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ions, and every thing that occa&s;ions a rapid circulation of the blood.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e may likewi&s;e proceed from wounds of the lungs. The&s;e may either be received from without, or they may be occa&s;ioned by hard bodies getting into the wind-pipe, and &s;o falling down upon the lungs, and hurt|ing their tender ve&s;&s;els. The ob&s;truction of any cu&s;toma|ry evacuation, may occa&s;ion a &s;pitting of blood; as the ne|glect of bleeding or purging at the u&s;ual &s;ea&s;ons, the &s;top|page of the bleeding, piles in men, or the men&s;es in women, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It may likewi&s;e proceed from a polypus, &s;chirrhous
<PB N="239" REF="012338_0243_0F88EA507A55EA08">
concretions, or any thing that ob&s;tructs the circulation of the blood in the lungs. It is often the effect of a long and violent cough; in which ca&s;e, it is generally the forerunner of a con&s;umption. A violent degree of cold, &s;uddenly ap|plied to the external parts of the body, will occa&s;ion an an haemoptoe. It may likewi&s;e be occa&s;ioned by breathing in air which is too much rarified to be able properly to ex|pand the lungs. This is often the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who work in hot places, as furnaces, gla&s;s hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It may likewi&s;e happen to &s;uch as a&s;cend to the top of very high mountains, as the peak of Teneriff, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>SPITTING of blood is not always to be con&s;idered as a primary di&s;ea&s;e. It is often only a &s;ymptom, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, not an unfavourable one. This is the ca&s;e in pleu|ri&s;ies, peripneumonies, and &s;undry other fevers. In a drop&s;y, &s;curvy, or con&s;umption, it is a bad &s;ymptom, and &s;hews that the lungs are ulcerated.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;Spitting of blood is gene|rally preceded by a &s;en&s;e of weight, and oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t, a dry tickling cough, hoar&s;ene&s;s, and a difficulty of breathing. Sometimes it is u&s;hered in with &s;hivering, cold|ne&s;s of the extremities, co&s;tivene&s;s, great la&s;&s;itude, flatu|lence, pains of the back and loins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As the&s;e &s;hew a general &s;tricture upon the ve&s;&s;els, and a tendency of the blood to inflammation, they are commonly the forerunners of a very copious di&s;charge. The&s;e &s;ymptoms do not at|tend a di&s;charge of blood from the gums or fauces, by which means they may always be di&s;tingui&s;hed from an haemoptoe. Sometimes the blood that is &s;pit up is thin, and of a florid red colour; and, at other times, it is thick, and of a dark or blacki&s;h colour; nothing, however, can be inferred from this circum&s;tance, but that the blood has lain a longer or &s;horter time in the brea&s;t before it was di&s;|charged.</P>
<P>SPITTING of blood, in a &s;trong healthy per&s;on, of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound con&s;titution, is &s;eldom dangerous; but when it at|tacks the tender and delicate, or per&s;ons of a weak lax fibre, it is not ea&s;ily removed. When it proceeds from a &s;chirrhous, or polypus of the lungs, it is bad. The danger is greater when the di&s;charge proceeds from the rupture of a large ve&s;&s;el than of a &s;mall one. When the extrava|&s;ated blood is not &s;pit up, but lodges in the brea&s;t, it cor|rupts, and greatly increa&s;es the danger. When the blood
<PB N="240" REF="012338_0244_0F88EA5153253AD8">
proceeds from an ulcer in the lungs, it is generally fa|tal.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;The patient ought to be kept cool, and perfectly at re&s;t. Every thing that heats the blood, or quickens the circulation, increa&s;es the danger. The mind ought likewi&s;e to be &s;oothed, and every occa&s;ion of exci|ting the pa&s;&s;ion avoided. The diet &s;hould be &s;oft, cool|ing, and &s;lender; as rice, boiled with milk, &s;mall broths, barley gruels, panada, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The diet, in this ca&s;e, can &s;carce be too low. Even water gruel is &s;ufficient to &s;up|port the patient for &s;ome days. All &s;trong liquors mu&s;t be avoided. The patient may drink milk and water, bar|ley water, whey, butter milk, and &s;uch like. Every thing &s;hould be drank cold, and in &s;mall quantities at a time. The patient mu&s;t ob&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ilence, or, at lea&s;t, &s;peak with a very low voice.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;This, like the other invo|luntary di&s;charges of blood, ought not to be &s;uddenly &s;top|ped by a&s;tringent medicines. More mi&s;chief is often done by the&s;e than if it were &s;uffered to go on. It may, how|ever, proceed &s;o far as to weaken the patient, and even en|danger his life, in which ca&s;e, proper means mu&s;t be u&s;ed for re&s;training it.</P>
<P>THE belly &s;hould be kept gently open by laxative diet; as roa&s;ted apples, &s;tewed prunes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If the&s;e &s;hould not have the effect, a tea &s;poonful of the lenitive electuary may be taken twice or thrice a-day, as is found nece&s;&s;ary. If the bleeding proves violent, ligatures may be applied to the extremities, as directed for the bleeding at the no&s;e.</P>
<P>IF the patient be hot or feveri&s;h, bleeding, and &s;mall do|&s;es of nitre, will be of u&s;e; a &s;cruple, or half a dram, may be taken in a cup of his ordinary drink, twice or thrice a-day. His drink may likewi&s;e be &s;harpened with acids, as juice of lemons, or a few drops of the &s;pirit of vitriol; or he may take frequently a cup of the tincture of ro&s;es, as di|rected in page 227.</P>
<P>BATHING the feet and legs in lukewarm water, by ta|king off &s;pa&s;ms, has a very good effect in this di&s;ea&s;e. Opi|ates too are &s;ometimes beneficial for that purpo&s;e; but the&s;e mu&s;t be given with the greate&s;t caution. Ten or twelve drops of laudanum may be given in a cup of barley water twice a-day, and continued for &s;ome time, provided they be found beneficial.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="012338_0245_0F88EA5209C85560">
THE con&s;erve of ro&s;es is likewi&s;e a very good medicine in this ca&s;e, provided it be taken in &s;ufficient quantity, and long enough per&s;i&s;ted in. It may be taken to the ex|tent of three or four ounces a-day; and, if the patient be troubled with a cough, it &s;hould be made into an electuary with bal&s;amic &s;yrup, and a little of the &s;yrup of poppies.</P>
<P>IF &s;tronger a&s;tringents be found nece&s;&s;ary, fifteen or twenty drops of the acid elixir of vitriol may be taken in a gla&s;s of water, three or four times a-day.</P>
<P>THOSE who are &s;ubject to frequent returns of this di&s;|ea&s;e, &s;hould be careful to avoid all exce&s;s. Their diet &s;hould be light and cool, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of milk and ve|getables. Above all, let them beware of vigorous efforts of the body, and violent agitations of the mind.</P>

<HEAD>VOMITING OF BLOOD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is not &s;o common as the other di&s;charges of blood which have already been mentioned; but it is more dan|gerous, and requires the greate&s;t attention.</P>
<P>VOMITING of blood is generally preceded by pains in the &s;tomach, &s;ickne&s;s and nau&s;ea, and is accompanied with great anxiety, and frequent fainting fits.</P>
<P>VOMITING of blood is &s;ometimes periodical; in which ca&s;e it is le&s;s dangerous. It often proceeds from an ob|&s;truction of the men&s;es in women; and &s;ometimes from the &s;topping of the haemorrhoidal flux in men. It may be occa&s;ioned by any thing that greatly &s;timulates or wounds the &s;tomach, as &s;trong vomits or purges, acrid poi&s;ons, &s;harp or hard &s;ub&s;tances taken into the &s;tomach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is often the effect of ob&s;tructions in the liver, the &s;pleen, or &s;ome of the other vi&s;cera. It may likewi&s;e proceed from external violence, as blows or brui&s;es, or from any of the cau&s;es which produce inflammation.</P>
<P>A great part of the danger in this di&s;ea&s;e ari&s;es from the extrava&s;ated blood lodging in the bowels, and becoming putrid, by which means a dy&s;entery or putrid fever may be occa&s;ioned. The be&s;t way of preventing this, is to keep the belly gently open, by frequently exhibiting emollient cly&s;ters. Purges mu&s;t not be given till the di&s;charge is &s;topt, otherwi&s;e they will irritate the &s;tomach, and increa&s;e the di&s;order. All the food and drink mu&s;t be of a mild cooling nature, and taken in &s;mall quantities. Even
<PB N="242" REF="012338_0246_0F88EA52B3E873C0">
drinking cold water has &s;ometimes proved a remedy. When there are &s;igns of an inflammation, bleeding may be nece&s;|&s;ary; but the patient's weakne&s;s will &s;eldom permit it. A&s;tringents can &s;eldom be u&s;ed, as they &s;timulate the &s;to|mach, and of cour&s;e increa&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e. Opiates may be of of u&s;e; but they mu&s;t be given in very &s;mall do&s;es, as four or five drops of liquid laudanum twice or thrice a-day. Af|ter the di&s;charge is over, as the patient is generally troubled with gripes, occa&s;ioned by the acrimony of the blood lodged in the inte&s;tines, gentle purges will be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD>OF BLOODY URINE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;order is commonly called <HI>pi&s;&s;ing of blood.</HI> It is a di&s;charge of blood, with or without urine, from the ve&s;&s;els of the kidneys or bladder, which may be either enlarged, broken, or eroded. It is more or le&s;s dangerous according to the different circum&s;tances which attend it.</P>
<P>WHEN pure blood is voided &s;uddenly without interrup|tion and without pain, it proceeds from the kidneys; but if the blood be in &s;mall quantity, of a dark colour, and emitted with heat and pain about the bottom of the belly, it pro|ceeds from the bladder. When bloody urine is occa&s;ioned by a large rough &s;tone de&s;cending from the kidneys to the bladder, which wounds the <HI>ureters,</HI> it is attended with a &s;harp pain in the back and difficulty of making water. If the coats of the bladder are hurt by a &s;tone, and bloody urine follows, it is attended with the mo&s;t acute pain, and a previous &s;toppage of urine.</P>
<P>BLOODY urine may likewi&s;e be occa&s;ioned by falls, blows, the lifting or carrying of heavy burdens, hard riding, or any violent motion. It may al&s;o proceed from ulcers or ero&s;ions of the bladder, from a &s;tone lodged in the kidney<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, or from violent purges, or &s;harp diuretic medicines, e&s;pecially cantharides.</P>
<P>BLOODY urine is always attended with &s;ome degree of danger; but it is peculiarly &s;o when mixed with purulent matter, as this &s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> an ulcer &s;omewhere in the urinary pa&s;&s;ages. Sometime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> this di&s;charge proceeds from exce&s;s of blood, in which ca&s;e it is rather to be con&s;idered as a &s;alu|tary evacuation than a di&s;ea&s;e. If the di&s;charge, however, be very great, it may wa&s;te the patient's &s;trength, and oc|ca&s;ion an ill habit of body, a drop&s;y, or a con&s;umption, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE treatment of this di&s;order mu&s;t be varied according to the different cau&s;es from which it proceeds.</P>

WHEN it is owing to a &s;tone in the bladder, the cure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e|pends upon an operation, which it is not our bu&s;ine&s;s to de|&s;cribe.</P>
<P>IF it be attended with a plethora, and &s;ymptoms of an inflammation, bleeding will be nece&s;&s;ary. The belly mu&s;t likewi&s;e be kept open by emollient cly&s;ters, or cooling pur|gative medicines; as cry&s;tals of tartar, rhubarb, manna, or &s;mall do&s;es of lenitive electuary.</P>

In this ca&s;e, the patient's life depends on the liberal u&s;e of the Je|&s;uits bark and acids, as has already been &s;hewn.</P>
<P>WHEN there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect an ulcer in the kidneys or bladder, the patient's diet mu&s;t be cool, and his drink of a &s;oft, healing, bal&s;amic quality, as decoctions of mar&s;h|mallow roots with liquorice, &s;olutions of gum Arabic, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Three ounces of mar&s;hmallow roots, and half an ounce of liquorice, may be boiled in two Engli&s;h quarts of water to one; two ounces of gum Arabic, and half an ounce of pu|rified nitre, may be di&s;&s;olved in the &s;trained liquor, and a tea cupful of it taken four or five times a-day.</P>
<P>THE early u&s;e of a&s;tringents, in this di&s;ea&s;e has often bad con&s;equences.

It is an u&s;ual &s;ymptom of hurts of the brain; as contu&s;ions, compre&s;&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is likewi&s;e a &s;ymptom of wounds, or inflammations of the diaphragm, inte&s;tines, &s;pleen, liver, kidneys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>VOMITING may be occa&s;ioned by unu&s;ual motions; as riding backwards in a cart or coach, &s;ailing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It may likewi&s;e be excited by violent pa&s;&s;ions, or by the idea of nau&s;eous objects, e&s;pecially of &s;uch things as have formerly produced vomiting. Sometimes it proceeds from a regur|gitation of the bile into the &s;tomach; in this ca&s;e, what the patient vomits is generally of a yellow or greeni&s;h colour, and has a bitter ta&s;te. Per&s;ons who are &s;ubject to nervous affections are often &s;uddenly &s;eized with violent fits of vo|miting. La&s;tly, Vomiting is a common &s;ymptom of preg|nancy. In this ca&s;e, it generally comes on about two weeks after the &s;topping of the <HI>men&s;es,</HI> and continues during the fir&s;t three or four months.</P>
<P>WHEN vomiting proceeds from a &s;oul &s;tomach or indi|ge&s;tion, it is not to be con&s;idered as a di&s;ea&s;e, but as the cure of a di&s;ea&s;e. It ought, therefore, to be promoted by drinking lukewarm water, or thin gruel. If this does not put a &s;top to the vomiting, a do&s;e of ipecacuanha may be taken, and wrought off with weak camomile tea.</P>
<P>WHEN the retroce&s;&s;ion of gouty matter, or the ob&s;truc|tion of cu&s;tomary evacuations occa&s;ion vomiting, all means mu&s;t be u&s;ed to re&s;tore the&s;e di&s;charges; or, if that cannot be effected, their place mu&s;t be &s;upplied by others, as bleed|ing, purging, bathing the extremities in warm water, opening i&s;&s;ues, &s;etons, perpetual bli&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN vomiting proceeds from pregnancy, it may ge|nerally be relieved by bleeding, and keeping, the belly gently open. The bleeding, however, ought to be in &s;mall quantities at a time, and the purgatives &s;hould be of the milde&s;t kind, as figs, &s;tewed prunes, manna or &s;enna. Preg|nant women are mo&s;t apt to vomit in the morning, imme|diately after getting out of bed, which is owing partly to

<PB N="245" REF="012338_0249_0F88EA582AF7BD98">
the change of po&s;ture, but more to the emptine&s;s of the &s;to|mach. It may generally be prevented by taking a di&s;h of tea, or &s;ome light breakfa&s;t in bed. Pregnant women, who are afflicted with vomiting, ought to be kept ea&s;y both in body and mind. They &s;hould neither allow their &s;tomachs to be quite empty, nor &s;hould they eat much at once. Cold water is a very good drink in this ca&s;e; if the &s;tomach be weak, a little brandy may be added to it. If the &s;pirits be low, and the per&s;on apt to faint, a &s;poonful of cinnamon water, with a little marmalade of quinces or oranges, may be taken.</P>
<P>IF vomiting proceeds from weakne&s;s of the &s;tomach, bit|ters will be of &s;ervice, as the Gentian root, camomile and &s;nakeroot, infu&s;ed in brandy or wine. To the&s;e may be added as much rhubarb as will keep the belly gently open. The Je&s;uits bark is likewi&s;e an excellent medicine for bracing and &s;trengthening the &s;tomach. It may be drank in form of tea, or infu&s;ed in wine or brandy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The elixir of vitriol is al&s;o a good medicine in this ca&s;e. It may be taken in the do&s;e of fifteen or twenty drops, twice or thrice a-day, in a gla&s;s of wine or water.</P>
<P>A vomiting which proceeds from acidities in the &s;tomach is relieved by alkaline purges. The be&s;t medicine of this kind is the magne&s;ia alba, a tea &s;poonful of which may be taken in a di&s;h of tea or a little milk, twice or thrice a-day, or oftener, if nece&s;&s;ary, to keep the belly open.</P>
<P>WHEN vomiting proceeds from violent pa&s;&s;ions, or affec|tions of the mind, all kind of evacuations mu&s;t be avoided, e&s;pecially vomits. The&s;e are exceeding dangerous. The patient, in this ca&s;e, ought to be perfectly ea&s;y and quiet, to have the mind &s;oothed, and to take &s;ome gentle cordial, as negas, or a little brandy and water. A few drops of li|quid laudanum may likewi&s;e be taken, to calm the &s;pirits, and take off the irritation upon the nerves.</P>
<P>WHEN vomiting proceeds from &s;pa&s;modic affections of the &s;tomach, mu&s;k, ca&s;tor, and other anti&s;pa&s;modic medi|cines are of u&s;e. Aromatic pla&s;ters have likewi&s;e a good effect. The &s;tomach pla&s;ter of the London or Edinburgh di&s;pen&s;atory may be applied to the pit of the &s;tomach, or rather a little towards the left &s;ide, &s;o as to cover a part of the fal&s;e ribs. Aromatic medicines may likewi&s;e be taken inwardly, as cinnamon tea, mint tea, wine with &s;piceries boiled in it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The region of the &s;tomach may be rubbed with aether, or, if that cannot be had, with &s;trong brandy,
<PB N="246" REF="012338_0250_0F88EA59CA3A58E0">
or other &s;pirits. The belly &s;hould be fomented with warm water, or the patient immer&s;ed up to the brea&s;t in a warm bath.</P>
<P>I have always found the &s;aline draughts mo&s;t effectual in &s;topping a vomiting, from whatever cau&s;e it proceeded. The&s;e may be made by di&s;&s;olving a dram of the &s;alt of tar|tar in an ounce and a half of fre&s;h lemon juice, adding to it an ounce of peppermint water, and half an ounce of &s;pi|ritous cinnamon water. This draught may be &s;weetened with a little white &s;ugar, and taken in the act of efferve|&s;cence. It mu&s;t be repeated every two hours, or every hour, if the vomiting be very violent. I do not remember to have &s;een this medicine, when duly per&s;i&s;ted in, fail to &s;top a vomiting.</P>
<P>AS the lea&s;t motion will often bring on the vomiting again, even after it has been &s;topped, the patient mu&s;t avoid all manner of action.

<P>WHEN a headach proceeds from the &s;toppage of a run|ning of the no&s;e, there is a heavy, obtu&s;e, pre&s;&s;ing pain in the forepart of the head, in which there &s;eems to be &s;uch a weight, that the patient can &s;carce hold it up. When it is occa&s;ioned by the cau&s;tic matter of the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, it generally affects the &s;kull, and often produces a <HI>caries</HI> of the bones.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the headach proceeds from the repul&s;ion, or retroce&s;&s;ion of the morbific matter of the gout, the ery|&s;ipelas, the &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, itch, or other eruptive di&s;ea&s;es. A <HI>hemicrania</HI> generally proceeds from crudities or indige&s;tion.</P>
<P>THERE is likewi&s;e a mo&s;t violent, fixed, con&s;tant, and almo&s;t intolerable headach, which occa&s;ions great debility both of body and mind, prevents &s;leep, di&s;turbs dige&s;tion, de&s;troys the appetite, cau&s;es a <HI>vertigo,</HI> dimne&s;s of &s;ight, a noi&s;e in the years, convul&s;ions, epileptic fits, and &s;ome|times vomiting, co&s;tivene&s;s, coldne&s;s of the extremities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE headach is often &s;ymptomatic in continual and in|termitting fevers, e&s;pecially quartans. It is likewi&s;e a very common &s;ymptom of hy&s;teric and hypochondriac com|plaints.</P>
<P>AN external pain of the head is &s;eldom dangerous. When it attends an acute fever, with pale urine, it is an unfa|vourable &s;ymptom. In exce&s;&s;ive headachs, coldne&s;s of the extremities is a bad &s;ign.

<P>THE cool regimen in general is to be ob&s;erved in this di&s;ea&s;e.

The drink ought to be diluting; as barley water, infu&s;ions of mild mucilaginous vegetables,

decoctions of the &s;udorific woods<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE decoction of woods is thus made: Take &s;havings of gu|aiacum wood, three ounces; rai&s;ins of the &s;un, &s;toned, two oun|ces; &s;a&s;&s;afras wood, &s;haved, one ounce; liquorice, &s;liced, half an ounce: Boil the guaiacum and rai&s;ins in an Engli&s;h gallon of wa|ter, over a gentle fire, to the con&s;umption of one half; adding to|wards the end the &s;a&s;&s;afras and liquorice.

The patient ought, as much as po&s;&s;i|ble, to keep an erect po&s;ture, and not to lie with his head too low.</P>
<P>WHEN the headach is owing to exce&s;s of blood, and in hot bilious con&s;titutions, bleeding is nece&s;&s;ary. The pati|ent may be bled in the jugular vein, and the operation re|peated if there be occa&s;ion.

In &s;ome ca&s;es it will be proper to bli&s;ter the whole head. In per&s;ons of a gro&s;s habit, i&s;|&s;ues, or perpetual bli&s;ters, will be of &s;ervice.

<P>BUT when the headach proceeds from a copious vitiated <HI>&s;erum</HI> &s;tagnating in the membranes, either within or with|out the &s;kull, with a dull, heavy, continual pain, which will neither yield to bleeding nor gentle laxatives, then more powerful purgatives are nece&s;&s;ary, as pills made of aloes, re&s;in of jalap, or the like. It will al&s;o be nece&s;&s;ary in this ca&s;e to bli&s;ter the whole head, and to keep the back part of the neck open for a con&s;iderable time by a perpetual bli&s;ter.</P>

<P>A <HI>hemicrania,</HI> e&s;pecially a periodical one, is generally owing to a foulne&s;s in the &s;tomach, for which gentle vo|mits will be beneficial, as al&s;o purges of rhubarb.

When a collection of matter is felt under the &s;kin, it mu&s;t be di&s;charged by an inci&s;ion, otherwi&s;e it will render the bone carious.</P>
<P>WHEN the headach is &s;o intolerable as to endanger the patient's life, or is attended with continual watching&punc; de|lirium, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to opiates.

<HEAD>OF THE TOOTHACH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o well known, that it needs no de&s;crip|tion. It has great affinity with the rheumati&s;m, and often &s;ucceeds pains of the &s;houlders and other joints.</P>
<P>IT may proceed from various cau&s;es; as ob&s;tructed per|&s;piration, or catching cold; or from any of the common cau&s;es of inflammation. I have often known the toothach
<PB N="250" REF="012338_0254_0F88EA5D55905AF0">
occa&s;ioned by neglecting &s;ome part of the u&s;ual coverings of the head, by &s;itting with the head bare near an open window, or its being any how expo&s;ed to a draught of cold air. Food or drink taken either too hot or too cold, is ve|ry hurtful to the teeth. Great quantities of &s;ugar, or other &s;weet-meats, are likewi&s;e hurtful. Nothing is more de&s;tructive to the teeth than cracking nuts, or chewing any kind of hard &s;ub&s;tances. Picking the teeth with pins, needles, or with any thing that may hurt the enamel with which they are covered, does great mi&s;chief; as the tooth is &s;ure to be &s;poilt whenever the air gets into it. Pregnant women are very &s;ubject to the toothach, e&s;pecially during the fir&s;t three or four months of pregnancy. The tooth|ach often proceeds from &s;corbutic humours affecting the gums. In this ca&s;e, the teeth are &s;ometimes wa&s;ted, and fall out without any con&s;iderable degree of pain. The proximate or immediate cau&s;e of the toothach is a rotten or <HI>carious</HI> tooth.</P>
<P>IN order to relieve the toothach, we mu&s;t endeavour to draw off or divert the humours from the part affected. This may be done by mild purgatives, bleeding and bath|ing the feet frequently in warm water. The per&s;piration ought likewi&s;e to be promoted, by drinking freely of weak wine whey, or other diluting liquors, with &s;mall do&s;es of nitre. Vomits too have often an exceeding good effect in the toothach. It is &s;eldom &s;afe to admini&s;ter opiates, or any kind of heating medicines, or even to draw a tooth till proper evacuations have been premi&s;ed, and the&s;e alone will often effect the cure.</P>
<P>NEXT to evacuations we recommend fomenting the part with warm water, or decoctions of emollient vegetables. Bags filled with boiled camomile flowers, flowers of elder, or the like, may be applied to the part affected, with as great a degree of warmth as the patient can bear, and re|newed as they grow cool. The patient may likewi&s;e re|ceive the &s;teams of warm water into his mouth, through an inverted funnel, or by holding his head over the mouth of a porringer filled with warm water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>GARGLES are likewi&s;e of u&s;e to make a di&s;charge from the part. Rob of elder di&s;&s;olved in &s;mall beer makes a ve|ry proper gargle, or an infu&s;ion of &s;age or mulberry leaves.</P>
<P>SUCH things as promote the di&s;charge of &s;aliva, or cau&s;e the patient to &s;pit, are always proper. For this pur|po&s;e, bitter, hot, or pungent vegetables may be chewed;
<PB N="251" REF="012338_0255_0F88EA5DF5308808">
as gentian, calamus aromaticus, or pellatory of Spain. Allen recommends the root of <HI>yellow water flower-de-luce</HI> in this ca&s;e. This root may either be rubbed upon the tooth or chewed. Brookes &s;ays, he hardly ever knew it fail to ea&s;e the toothach.</P>
<P>MANY other herbs, roots, and &s;eeds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are recom|mended for curing the toothach; as the leaves or roots of millefoil or yarrow chewed, tobacco &s;moaked or chewed, or the a&s;hes put into the hollow tooth, &s;taves acre, or the &s;eeds of mu&s;tard chewed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e bitter, hot, and pungent things, by occa&s;ioning a great flow of <HI>&s;aliva,</HI> fre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ea&s;e in the toothach.</P>
<P>OPIATES often relieve the toothach. For this purpo&s;e a little cotton wet with laudanum may be held between the teeth; or a piece of &s;ticking pla&s;ter, about the bigne&s;s of a &s;ixpence, with a bit of opium in the middle of it, of a &s;ize not to prevent the &s;ticking of the other, may be laid on the temporal artery, where the pul&s;ation is mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible. <HI>De la Motte</HI> affirms, that there are few ca&s;es wherein this will not give relief. If there be a hollow tooth, a &s;mall pill made of equal quantities of camphire and opium, put into the hollow, is often beneficial. When this cannot be had, the hollow tooth may be filled with gum ma&s;tich, wax, lead, or any &s;ub&s;tance that will &s;tick in it, and keep the external air out.</P>
<P>FEW applications give more relief in the toothach than bli&s;tering pla&s;ters. The&s;e may be applied betwixt the &s;houlders, but they have the be&s;t effect when put behind the ears, and made &s;o large as to cover a part of the lower jaw. Burning the nerve within the affected tooth with a hot iron, has frequently given ea&s;e; but this operation ought to be done with care. Applying a hot iron to the <HI>antetragus,</HI> or what is called <HI>the inner bar of the ear,</HI> is like|wi&s;e a noted cure for the toothach. Bli&s;tering, however, is more &s;afe than either of the&s;e, and is not le&s;s efficaci|ous.</P>
<P>HOFFMAN &s;ays, When every thing el&s;e failed, that he had often great &s;ucce&s;s from the following pills.</P>
<P>TAKE of aromatic pill one dram, &s;torax pill half a dram, extract of &s;affron &s;ix grains. Make them into nine pills; of which &s;ix or eight are to be taken at bed time for a do&s;e.</P>
<P>AFTER all, when a tooth is carious, it is often impo&s;&s;i|ble to remove the pain, without drawing the tooth; and,
<PB N="252" REF="012338_0256_0F88EA5EC09A01C8">
as a &s;poilt tooth never becomes &s;ound again, it is prudent to draw it &s;oon, left it &s;hould affect the re&s;t. Tooth drawing, like bleeding, is very much practi&s;ed by mecha|nics as well as per&s;ons of the medical profe&s;&s;ion. The operation however is not without danger, and ought al|ways to be done with care. A per&s;on unacquainted with the &s;tructure of the parts, will be in danger of breaking the jaw-bone, or of drawing a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound tooth in&s;tead of a rotten one, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN a &s;ound tooth has been drawn, if it be replaced immediately, it will grow in again. It is now a common practice to draw a rotten tooth, and put a &s;ound one, taken from the mouth of &s;ome other per&s;on, in its place. It is likewi&s;e an ea&s;y matter to fix artificial teeth &s;o neatly, as to an&s;wer mo&s;t of the purpo&s;es of the natural; but the&s;e are matters which do not properly fall under our con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>WHEN the toothach returns periodically, and the pain chiefly affects the gums, it may be cured by the bark.</P>
<P>SOME pretend to have found great benefit in the tooth|ach, from the application of an artificial magnet to the af|fected tooth. We &s;hall not attempt to account for its mode of operation; but, if it be found to an&s;wer, though only in particular ca&s;es, it certainly de&s;erves a trial, as it is attended with no expence, and cannot do any harm.</P>
<P>PERSONS who have returns of the toothach at certain &s;ea&s;ons, as &s;pring and autu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, might often prevent it by taking a do&s;e of phy&s;ic at the&s;e times.</P>
<P>KEEPING the teeth clean has no doubt a tendency to prevent the toothach. The be&s;t method of doing this is to wa&s;h them daily with &s;alt and water, or with cold water alone. All bru&s;hing and &s;craping of the teeth is dangerous, and, unle&s;s it be performed with great care, mu&s;t do mi&s;|chief.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE EARACH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;order chiefly affects the membrane which lines the inner cavity of the ear, called the <HI>meatus auditorius.</HI> It is often &s;o violent as to occa&s;ion great re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s and anxiety, and even delirium. Sometimes epileptic fits, and other convul&s;ive di&s;orders, have been brought on by ex|treme pain in the ear.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="012338_0257_0F88EA5F8306DF30">
THE earach may proceed from any of the cau&s;es which produce inflammation. It often proceeds from a &s;udden &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of per&s;piration, or from the head being expo&s;ed to cold when covered with &s;weat. It may al&s;o be occa&s;ion|ed by worms, or other in&s;ects getting into the ear, or be|ing bred there; or from any hard body &s;ticking in the ear. Sometimes it proceeds from the tran&s;lation of morbific mat|ter to the ear. This often happens in the decline of malig|nant fevers, and occa&s;ions deafne&s;s, which is generally reckoned a favourable &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>WHEN the earach proceeds from in&s;ects, or any hard body &s;ticking in the ear, every method mu&s;t be taken to remove them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. The membranes may be relaxed by dropping into the ear oil of almonds, or olive oil. Afterwards the patient &s;hould be made to &s;neeze, by taking &s;nuff, or &s;ome &s;trong &s;ternutatory. If this &s;hould not force out the body, it mu&s;t be extracted by art. I have &s;een in&s;ects which have got into the ear, come out of their own accord upon pouring in oil upon them, which is a thing they cannot bear.</P>
<P>WHEN the pain of the ear proceeds from inflammation, it mu&s;t be treated like other topical inflammations, by a cool|ing regimen and opening medicines. Bleeding at the be|ginning, either in the arm or jugular vein, or cupping in the neck, will be proper. The ear may likewi&s;e be fo|mented with &s;teams of warm water, or flannel-bags filled with boiled mallows and camomile flowers may be applied to it warm; or bladders filled with warm milk and water. An exceeding good method of fomenting the ear is to apply it clo&s;e to the mouth of a jug filled with a &s;trong decoction of camomile flowers.</P>
<P>THE patient's feet &s;hould be frequently bathed in luke|warm water, and he ought to take &s;mall do&s;es of nitre and rhubarb, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> a &s;cruple of the former, and ten grains of the latter three times a-day. His drink may be whey, or decoctions of barley and liquorice, with figs or rai&s;ins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The parts behind the ear ought frequently to be rubbed with camphorated oil, or the volatile liniment; and a few drops of the camphorated &s;pirit of wine may be put into the ear with wool or cotton.</P>
<P>WHEN the inflammation cannot be re&s;olved, a poultice of bread and milk, or roa&s;ted onions, may be applied to the ear, and frequently renewed, till it breaks, or the ab&s;ce&s;s can be opened. Afterwards the humours may be diverted
<PB N="254" REF="012338_0258_0F88EA6050AD5538">
from the part by gentle laxatives, bli&s;ters, or i&s;&s;ues; but the di&s;charge mu&s;t not be &s;uddenly dried up by any exter|nal application. I have often known the &s;udden drying of a running of the ear produce fatal con&s;equences.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE HEART-BURN.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT is called the <HI>heart-burn,</HI> is not a di&s;ea&s;e of that organ, but an unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation of heat or acrimony about the pit of the &s;tomach, which is &s;ometimes attended with anxiety, nau&s;ea, and vomiting.</P>
<P>IT may proceed from indige&s;tion, from the acidity of the fluids, or contents of the &s;tomach, or from bilious humours. Stale liquors, vinegar, grea&s;y aliment, wind, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will cau&s;e the heart-burn. In &s;ome con&s;titutions it is occa&s;ioned by the u&s;e of acids, and in others by aromatics. Pregnant wo|men are very &s;ubject to it.</P>
<P>WHEN the heart-burn proceeds from indige&s;tion, or a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oul &s;tomach, the patient ought to take a vomit, and after|wards a purge. After the &s;tomach has been clean&s;ed, he may drink twice or thrice a-day a cup of camomile tea, with fifteen or twenty drops of elixir of vitriol in it, in order to &s;trengthen the &s;tomach and promote dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>WHEN acidity or &s;ourne&s;s of the &s;tomach occa&s;ions the heart-burn, ab&s;orbents are the proper medicines. In this ca&s;e, chalk and water, or what is called the chalk julep, often an&s;wers very well. It is made by mixing an ounce of powdered chalk, half an ounce of fine &s;ugar, and a quarter of an ounce of gum Arabic, in two Engli&s;h pints of water. A tea cupful of this may be taken at plea&s;ure. When the gum Arabic cannot be had, the chalk may be mixed with milk, or taken in water alone. The te&s;tacious powders are very proper here. A tea &s;poonful of prepared oy&s;ter &s;hells, or the powder called crab's eyes, may be taken in a gla&s;s of peppermint water, or &s;imple cinnamon water, as often as there is occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;afe&s;t ab&s;orbent which we know, is the <HI>magne&s;ia alba.</HI> This not only acts as an ab&s;orbent, but by its purg|ing quality clean&s;es the bowels; whereas the chalk, and other ab&s;orbents of that &s;ort, are apt to lie in the inte&s;tines, and occa&s;ion ob&s;tructions. This powder is no way di&s;|agreeable, and may be taken in a cup of tea, a little milk, or a gla&s;s of peppermint water. A large tea &s;poonful is the u&s;ual do&s;e, but there is no danger in taking a much greater
<PB N="255" REF="012338_0259_0F88EA60F7AD6330">
quantity, and it may be repeated as often as is found nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>WHEN the heart-burn proceeds from bilious humours, a tea &s;poonful of the &s;weet &s;pirits of nitre in a gla&s;s of wa|ter, or a cup of tea or coffee, will generally give ea&s;e. If it be cau&s;ed by fat or grea&s;y aliments, a dram of brandy or rum may be taken.</P>
<P>IF wind be the cau&s;e of this complaint, the medicines called carminatives are proper; as ani&s;eeds, juniper berries, cardamum &s;eeds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e may either be chewed, or a gla&s;s of their di&s;tilled waters taken at plea&s;ure. The&s;e, and other warm aromatics, as ginger, canella alba, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> give ea&s;e, but they ought never to be u&s;ed unle&s;s when nece&s;&s;ary. They are only drams in a dry form, and very pernicious to the &s;tomach. One of the &s;afe&s;t medicines of this kind is the tincture made by infu&s;ing an ounce of rhubarb, and a quarter of an ounce of the le&s;&s;er cardamums, in an Engli&s;h pint of brandy. This mu&s;t dige&s;t for two days; afterwards it &s;hould be &s;trained, and four ounces of white &s;ugar-candy in powder added to it. It mu&s;t &s;tand to dige&s;t again till the &s;ugar be di&s;&s;olved. A table &s;poonful may be taken for a do&s;e.</P>

I have often known exerci&s;e remove this complaint, e&s;pecially &s;ailing, or a long journey on hor&s;eback, or in a machine.</P>
<P>WHEN a pain of the &s;tomach proceeds from flatulencies, the patient is con&s;tantly belching up wind, and feels an un|ea&s;y di&s;ten&s;ion of the &s;tomach after meals. This is a mo&s;t deplorable di&s;ea&s;e, and is &s;eldom cured. In general, the pa|tient ought to avoid all windy diet, and every thing that &s;ours on the &s;tomach, as greens, roots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This rule, how|ever, admits of &s;ome exceptions. I have known &s;everal in|&s;tances of per&s;ons very much troubled with wind, who re|ceived great benefit from eating parched peas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THESE are prepared by &s;teeping or &s;oaking peas in water, and afterwards drying them in a pot or kiln till they be quite hard. They may be u&s;ed at plea&s;ure.</NOTE>, though that grain is well known to be of a windy nature. This com|plaint may likewi&s;e be greatly relieved by exerci&s;e, e&s;peci|ally digging, walking, or riding, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I have found the elixir of vitriol an&s;wer very well in flatulencies. It may be taken as directed in page 254.</P>
<P>WHEN a pain of the &s;tomach is occa&s;ioned by the &s;wal|lowing of acrid or poi&s;onous &s;ub&s;tances, they mu&s;t be di&s;|charged by vomit; this may be excited by butter, oils, or other &s;oft things, which &s;heath and defend the &s;tomach from the acrimony of its contents.</P>
<P>WHEN a pain of the &s;tomach proceeds from a tran&s;lation of gouty matter, warm cordials are nece&s;&s;ary. Some have drank a whole bottle of brandy or rum, in this ca&s;e, in a few hours, without being in the lea&s;t intoxicated, or even feeling the &s;tomach warmed by it. Generous wines, how|ever, are more &s;afe, as genuine Madeira, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is impo&s;|&s;ible to a&s;certain the quantities nece&s;&s;ary upon the&s;e occa|&s;ions. This mu&s;t be left to the feelings and di&s;cretion of the patient. It is, however, the &s;afe&s;t way not to go too far. When there is an inclination to vomit, it may be pro|moted by drinking an infu&s;ion of camomile flowers or <HI>car|duus benedictus.</HI></P>
<P>IF a pain of the &s;tomach proceeds from the &s;toppage of cu&s;tomary evacuations, bleeding will, in &s;ome ca&s;es, be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, e&s;pecially in &s;anguine and very full habits. It will

<P>WHEN the di&s;ea&s;e is occa&s;ioned by worms, they mu&s;t be de&s;troyed, or expelled by &s;uch means as are recom|mended in the following &s;ection.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF WORMS.</HEAD>
<P>THESE are chiefly of three kinds, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>taenia,</HI> or tape worm; the <HI>teres,</HI> or round and long worm, and the <HI>a&s;carides,</HI> or round and &s;hort worm. There are many other kinds of worms found in the human body; but as they proceed, in a great mea&s;ure, from &s;imilar cau&s;es, have nearly the &s;ame &s;ymptoms, and require almo&s;t the &s;ame method of cure, we &s;hall not &s;pend time in enumera|ting them.</P>
<P>THE tape worm is white, very long, and all over joint|ed. It is generally bred either in the &s;tomach or &s;mall in|te&s;tines. The round and long worm is likewi&s;e bred in the &s;mall guts, and &s;ometimes in the &s;tomach. The round and &s;hort worms commonly lodge in the <HI>rectum,</HI> or what is called the end gut, and occa&s;ion a di&s;agreeable itching about the <HI>anus.</HI></P>
<P>THE long round worms occa&s;ion &s;queami&s;hne&s;s, vo|miting, an ill breath, gripes, loo&s;ene&s;s, &s;welling of the belly, &s;woonings, loathing of food, and, at other times, a voracious appetite, a dry cough, convul&s;ions, epileptic fits, and &s;ometimes a privation of &s;peech. The&s;e worms have been known to perforate the inte&s;tines, and get into the cavity of the belly. The effects of the tape worm are nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the long and round, but ra|ther more violent.</P>
<P>ANDRY &s;ays, the following &s;ymptoms particularly at|tend the <HI>folium,</HI> which is a &s;pecies of the tape worm, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> &s;woonings, privation of &s;peech, and a voracious appetite. The round worms called <HI>a&s;carides,</HI> be&s;ides an itching of the <HI>anus,</HI> cau&s;e &s;woonings, and tene&s;mus, or an inclination to go to &s;tool.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;Worms may proceed from various cau&s;es; but they are &s;eldom found but in weak and relaxed &s;tomachs, where the dige&s;tion is bad. Sedentary per&s;ons
<PB N="258" REF="012338_0262_0F88EA656C538CA8">
are more liable to them than the active and laborious. Tho&s;e who eat great quantities of unripe fruit, or who live much on raw herbs and roots, are generally &s;ubject to worms. Worms are often a &s;ymptom of fevers, and other acute di&s;ea&s;es. There &s;eems to be a hereditary di&s;po&s;ition in &s;ome per&s;ons to this di&s;ea&s;e. I have often &s;een all the children of a fa|mily &s;ubject to worms of a particular kind. They &s;eem likewi&s;e frequently to be owing to the nur&s;e. Children of the &s;ame family, nur&s;ed by one woman, have often worms, when tho&s;e nur&s;ed by another have none.</P>
<P>CHILDREN are more liable to this di&s;ea&s;e than adults, e&s;pecially after two years of age. Infants while on the brea&s;t, are &s;eldom troubled with worms. To this, how|ever, there are &s;everal exceptions. I lately &s;aw an in&s;tance of a child who pa&s;&s;ed worms before it was three months old. They were indeed of a very particular kind, being real caterpillars. Some of them were above an inch long; they had red heads, and were &s;o bri&s;k as to jump about; they lived &s;everal days after the child had pa&s;&s;ed them. Another child &s;uckled by the &s;ame woman, pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame kind of worms when upon the brea&s;t, and both children &s;uffered extremely before the worms came away.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;The common &s;ymptoms of worms are, palene&s;s of the countenance, and, at other times, an univer&s;al flu&s;hing of the face; itching of the no&s;e, this however is doubtful, as children pick their no&s;es in all di&s;ea&s;es; &s;tarting, and grinding of the teeth in &s;leep; the appetite &s;ometimes bad, at other times quite voracious; loo&s;ene&s;s, a &s;our or &s;tinking breath, a hard &s;welled belly, great thir&s;t, the urine frothy, and &s;ometimes of a whiti&s;h colour, griping, or colic pains, an involuntary di&s;charge of <HI>&s;aliva,</HI> e&s;pecially when a&s;leep; frequent pains of the &s;ide, with a dry cough, and unequal pul&s;e; palpitations of the heart, &s;woonings, drow&s;ine&s;s, cold &s;weats, pal&s;y, epileptic fits, with many other unaccountable nervous &s;ymptoms, which were formerly attributed to witchcraft, or the influence of evil &s;pirits. Small bodies in the excre|ments, re&s;embling melon or cucumber &s;eeds, are &s;ymptoms of the tape worm.</P>
<P>THOUGH this is a very common di&s;ea&s;e, yet it is le&s;s &s;o than is generally imagined. Nur&s;es impute mo&s;t of the di&s;ea&s;es of children to worms, and often give medicine to kill the&s;e vermin where they do not exi&s;t. Even phy&s;ici|ans are often deceived with re&s;pect to worms. I have fre|quently
<PB N="259" REF="012338_0263_0F88EA665B2F88A0">
opened children who were thought to have been killed by them, and found none. In &s;hort there is no certain proof of worms exi&s;ting in the inte&s;tines, but their being pa&s;&s;ed; and that will &s;ometimes happen where no previous &s;ymptoms appeared.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;Though numberle&s;s medi|cines are extolled for killing and expelling worms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A medical writer of the pre&s;ent age, has enumerated upwards of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ty Briti&s;h plants, all famous for killing and expelling worms out of the body.</NOTE>, yet no di&s;ea&s;e&punc; more frequently baffles the phy&s;ician's &s;kill. In general, the mo&s;t proper medicines for their expul&s;ion are&punc; &s;trong purgatives; and to prevent their breeding, &s;toma-chic bitters, with now and then a gla&s;s of good wine.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t purge for an adult is jalap and calomel. Five and twenty or thirty grains of the former, with &s;ix or &s;even of the latter, mixed in &s;yrup, may be taken for a do&s;e. This &s;hould be taken early in the morning. It will be proper that the patient keep the hou&s;e all day, and drink nothing cold. The do&s;e may be repeated once or twice a-week, for a fortnight or three weeks. On the inter|mediate days the patient may take a dram of the powder of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, twice or thrice a day, mixed with &s;yrup, honey, or treacle.</P>
<P>THOSE who do not choo&s;e to take calomel, may make u&s;e of the bitter purgatives; as aloes, hiera picra, tincture of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">enna and rhubarb, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>OILY medicines are likewi&s;e of u&s;e for expelling worms. An ounce of &s;alad oil and a table &s;poonful of common &s;alt, may be taken in a gla&s;s of red port wine thrice a-day, or oftener if the &s;tomach will bear it. But the more com|mon form of u&s;ing oil is in cly&s;ters. Oily cly&s;ters &s;weeten|ed with &s;ugar or honey, are very efficacious in bringing away the &s;hort round worms called <HI>a&s;carides.</HI></P>
<P>THE Harrowgate water is an excellent medicine for ex|pelling worms, e&s;pecially the <HI>a&s;carides.</HI> As this water evi|dently abounds with &s;ulphur, we may hence infer, that &s;ulphur alone mu&s;t be a good medicine in this ca&s;e; this is found to be true in fact. Many practitioners give flour of &s;ulphur in very large do&s;es, and with great &s;ucce&s;s. It may be made into an electuary with honey or treacle, and taken in &s;uch quantity as to purge the patient.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="012338_0264_0F88EA66ED017430">
WHERE Harrowgate water cannot be obtained, &s;ea water may be u&s;ed, which is far from being a contempti|ble medicine in this ca&s;e. If &s;ea water cannot be had, common &s;alt may be di&s;&s;olved in water and drank. I have often &s;een this u&s;ed by country nur&s;es, when they &s;u&s;pect|ed their children were troubled with worms, with very good effect.</P>
<P>BUT worms, though expelled, will &s;oon breed again, if the &s;tomach remains weak and relaxed; to prevent this, we would recommend the Je&s;uits bark. Half a dram of bark in powder may be taken in a gla&s;s of red Port wine, three or four times a-day, after the above medicines have been u&s;ed. Lime water is likewi&s;e good for this purpo&s;e, or a table &s;poonful of the chalybeate wine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE chalybeate wine is made by dige&s;ting three ounces of fi|lings of iron, and half a dram of cochineal, in two Engli&s;h pints of Rheni&s;h wine for three weeks, frequently &s;haking the ve&s;&s;el. Af|terwards the liquor mu&s;t be filtered.</NOTE>, taken twice or thrice a-day. Infu&s;ions or decoctions of bitter herbs may likewi&s;e be drank; as the infu&s;ion of tan&s;y, water trefoil, camomile flowers, tops of wormwood, the le&s;&s;er centaury, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE above directions are calculated for adults; but for children the medicines mu&s;t be more agreeable, and given in &s;maller do&s;es.</P>
<P>FOR a child of four or five years old, ten grains of rhu|barb, five of jalap, and two of calomel, may be mixed in a &s;poonful of &s;yrup or honey, and given in the morning. The child &s;hould keep the hou&s;e all day, and have nothing cold. This do&s;e may be repeated twice a-week for three or four weeks. On the intermediate days the child may take a &s;cruple of powder of tin, and ten grains of aethiops mine|ral, in a &s;poonful of treacle twice a-day. The&s;e do&s;es mu&s;t be increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed according to the age of the pa|tient.</P>
<P>I have frequently known tho&s;e big bellies, which in children are commonly reckoned a &s;ign of worms, quite removed by giving them white &s;oap in their pottage, or other food. Tan&s;y, garlic, and rue, are all good again&s;t worms, and may be u&s;ed various ways. We might here mention many plants, both for external and internal u&s;e, but think the powder of tin, with aethiops mineral, and the purges of rhubarb and calomel, are much more to be de|pended on. It will not, however, be ami&s;s to give a child

who is troubled with worms a gla&s;s of red wine now and then, as every thing that braces and &s;trengthens the &s;tomach is good both for preventing and expelling the&s;e vermine.</P>
<P>PARENTS who would pre&s;erve their children from worms, ought to allow them plenty of exerci&s;e in the open air, to &s;ee that their food be whole&s;ome and &s;ufficiently &s;olid, and, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to prevent their eating raw herbs, roots, or green tra&s;hy fruits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">WE think it nece&s;&s;ary here to warn people of their danger who buy worm cakes and powders at random from quacks, and give them to their children without proper care. The principal ingre|dient in mo&s;t of the&s;e medicines is mercury, which is never to be trifled with. I lately &s;aw a &s;hocking in&s;tance of the danger of this conduct. A girl who had taken a do&s;e of worm-powder, bought of a travelling quack, went out, and I believe might be &s;o imprudent as to drink cold water, during its operation. She immediately &s;welled, and died that very day, with all the &s;ymptoms of having been poi&s;oned.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE JAUNDICE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e is fir&s;t ob&s;ervable in the white of the eye, which appears of a yellowi&s;h colour. Afterwards, the whole &s;kin puts on a yellow, and &s;ometimes a blacki&s;h appearance. The urine too is of a &s;affron hue, and dyes a white cloth, if put into it, of the &s;ame colour.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;The immediate cau&s;e of the jaundice is an ob&s;truction of the bile. The remote or occa&s;ional cau&s;es are, the bites of poi&s;onous animals, as the viper, mad dog, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the bilious or hy&s;teric colic, violent pa&s;&s;ions, as grief, anger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Strong purges or vomits will likewi&s;e oc|ca&s;ion the jaundice. Sometimes it proceeds from ob&s;tinate agues, or from that di&s;ea&s;e being prematurely &s;topped by a&s;tringent medicines. In infants it is often occa&s;ioned by the <HI>meconium</HI> not being &s;ufficiently purged off. Pregnant women are very &s;ubject to it. It is likewi&s;e a &s;ymptom in &s;everal kinds of fevers. Catching cold, or the &s;topping of cu&s;tomary evacuations, as the <HI>men&s;es,</HI> the bleeding piles, i&s;&s;ues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will occa&s;ion the jaundice.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;The patient at fir&s;t complains <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> exce&s;&s;ive wearine&s;s, and has great aver&s;ion to any kind of motion. His &s;kin is dry, and he generally feels a kind of itching or pricking pain over the whole body. The &s;tools are of a whiti&s;h or clay colour, and the urine, as was ob|&s;erved
<PB N="262" REF="012338_0266_0F88EA693126C380">
&s;erved above, is yellow. The breathing is difficult, and the patient complains of an unu&s;ual load or oppre&s;&s;ion on his brea&s;t. There is a heat in the no&s;trils, a bitter ta&s;te in the mouth, loathing of food, &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, vomiting, flatulency, and frequently all objects appear to the eye of a yellow colour.</P>
<P>IF the patient be young, and the di&s;ea&s;e complicated with no other malady, it is &s;eldom dangerous; but in old people, where it continues long, returns frequently, or is complicated with the drop&s;y or hypochondriac &s;ymptoms, it generally proves fatal. The black jaundice is more dan|gerous than the yellow.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;The diet &s;hould be cool, light, and diluting, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of ripe fruits and mild ve|getables; as apples boiled or roa&s;ted, &s;tewed prunes, pre|&s;erved plumbs, boiled &s;pinage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Veal or chicken broth, with light bread, are likewi&s;e very proper. The drink &s;hould be butter milk, whey, &s;weetened with honey, or decoctions of cool opening vegetables; as mar&s;hmal|low roots, with liquorice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE patient &s;hould take as much exerci&s;e as he can bear, either on hor&s;eback or in a machine; walking, run|ning, and even jumping, are likewi&s;e proper, provided he can bear them without pain, and there be no &s;ymptoms of inflammation. Patients have been often cured of this di&s;ea&s;e by a long journey, after medicines had proved inef|fectual.</P>
<P>AMUSEMENTS are likewi&s;e of great u&s;e in the jaundice. The di&s;ea&s;e is often occa&s;ioned by a &s;edentary life, joined to a dull melancholy di&s;po&s;ition. Whatever therefore tends to promote mu&s;cular motion, and to cheer the &s;pirits, mu&s;t have a good effect; as dancing, laughing, &s;inging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;If the patient be young, of a full &s;anguine habit, and complains of pain in the right &s;ide about the region of the liver, bleeding will be nece&s;&s;a|ry. After this a vomit mu&s;t be admini&s;tered; and if the di&s;ea&s;e proves ob&s;tinate, it may be repeated once or twice. No medicines are more beneficial in the jaundice than vo|mits, e&s;pecially where it is not attended with inflammati|on. Half a dram of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ecacuanha in powder will be a &s;uf|ficient do&s;e for an adult. It may be wrought off with weak camomile tea, or lukewarm water.</P>
<P>THE belly mu&s;t likewi&s;e be kept open by mild purga|tives. Ca&s;tile &s;oap, if taken in &s;ufficient quantities, an|&s;wers
<PB N="263" REF="012338_0267_0F88EA6A2CC75930">
this purpo&s;e extremely well. It may be taken from half an ounce to an ounce daily, for a con&s;iderable time. As few people have re&s;olution to &s;wallow &s;uch large quan|tities of &s;oap, I generally give pills made of &s;oap, aloes, and rhubarb, which an&s;wer the &s;ame intention in a &s;maller do&s;e. They may be prepared in the following man|ner:</P>
<P>TAKE &s;ocotrine aloes and Turkey rhubarb in powder, of each a dram, Ca&s;tile &s;oap an ounce. Beat them all to|gether, with a little &s;yrup, into a proper con&s;i&s;tence for pills. Let them be formed into pills of an ordinary &s;ize, and five or &s;ix of them taken three times a-day. They mu&s;t be continued for &s;ome time, and the quantity regulated by the patient's &s;tools, of which he ought at lea&s;t to have one or two every day.</P>
<P>FOMENTING the parts about the region of the &s;tomach and liver, and rubbing them with a warm hand or fle&s;h-bru&s;h, are likewi&s;e beneficial; but it is &s;till more &s;o for the patient to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it in a ve&s;&s;el of warm water up to the brea&s;t. He ought to do this frequently, and &s;hould continue in it as long as his &s;trength will permit.</P>
<P>MANY dirty things are recommended for the cure of the jaundice; as lice, the mill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pedes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the&s;e do more harm than good, as people tru&s;t to them, and ne|glect more valuable medicines; be&s;ides, they are &s;eldom taken in &s;ufficient quantity to produce any effects. Peo|ple always expect that the&s;e <HI>out of the way things</HI> &s;hould act as charms, and con&s;equently &s;eldom per&s;i&s;t in the u&s;e of them. Vomits, purges, fomentations, and exerci&s;e, will &s;eldom fail to cure the jaundice when it is a &s;imple di&s;ea&s;e; and when complicated with the drop&s;y, or other chronic complaints, it is hardly to be cured by any means.</P>
<P>NUMBERLESS Briti&s;h herbs are extolled for the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e. Dr. Short, in his <HI>Medicina Britannica,</HI> men|tions near a hundred, all famous for curing the jaundice. The fact is, this di&s;ea&s;e often goes off of its own accord; in which ca&s;e the la&s;t medicine is always &s;aid to have per|formed the cure. I have however &s;een con&s;iderable benefit in a very ob&s;tinate jaundice, from a decoction of hemp &s;eed. Four ounces of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eed may be boiled in two En|gli&s;h qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ts of ale, and &s;weetened with coar&s;e &s;ugar. The do&s;e is half an Engli&s;h pint every morning. It may be continued for eight or nine days.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="012338_0268_0F88EA6AAAA28D00">
I have known Harrowgate water cure a very ob&s;tinate jaundice. I have known patients, after taking many me|dicines without effect, go thither in the middle of winter, and in few weeks return quite well. They both drank the &s;ulphur water, and bathed.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE DROPSY.</HEAD>
<P>THE drop&s;y is a preternatural &s;welling of the whole bo|dy, or &s;ome part of it, occa&s;ioned by a collection of watery humour. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed by different names, according to the part affected, as the <HI>ana&s;arca,</HI> or a collection of wa|ter under the &s;kin; the <HI>a&s;cites,</HI> or a collection of water in the belly; the <HI>hydrops pectoris,</HI> or drop&s;y of the brea&s;t; the <HI>hydrocephalus,</HI> or drop&s;y of the brain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There is likewi&s;e a &s;pecies of drop&s;y called <HI>tympany,</HI> which is occa|&s;ioned by ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ified air pent up in the cavities or cells of the body.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;A very common cau&s;e of the drop|&s;y is a hereditary di&s;po&s;ition. It may likewi&s;e proceed from drinking ardent &s;pirits, or other &s;trong liquors. It is true, almo&s;t to a proverb, that great drinkers die of a drop|&s;y. The want of exerci&s;e is al&s;o a very common cau&s;e of the drop&s;y. Hence it is ju&s;tly reckoned among the di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;edentary. It often proceeds from exce&s;&s;ive evacua|tions, as frequent and copious bleedings, &s;trong purges of|ten repeated, frequent &s;alivations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The &s;udden &s;top|page of cu&s;tomary or nece&s;&s;ary evacuations, as the <HI>men&s;es,</HI> the haemorrhoids, or fluxes of the belly, may likewi&s;e cau&s;e a drop&s;y.</P>
<P>I have often known the drop&s;y occa&s;ioned by drinking large quantities of cold, weak, watery liquor after violent exerci&s;e, while the body was hot. A low, damp, or mar&s;hy &s;ituation is likewi&s;e a frequent cau&s;e of it. Hence it is a common di&s;ea&s;e in moi&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lat, fenny countries. It may al&s;o be brought on by a long cour&s;e of poor watery diet, or the u&s;e of vi&s;cous aliment, that is hard of dige&s;tion. It is often the effect of other di&s;ea&s;es, as the jaundice, a &s;chirrhous of the liver, a violent ague, of long continuance, a diarr|hoea, a dy&s;entery, an empyema, or a con&s;umption of the lungs. In &s;hort, whatever ob&s;tructs the circulation of the blood, or prevents its being duly prepared, may occa&s;ion a drop&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="012338_0269_0F88EA6DF542EB10">
SYMPTOMS.&mdash;This di&s;ea&s;e generally begins with a &s;welling of the feet and ancles towards night, which for &s;ome time di&s;appears in the morning. In the evening the parts, if pre&s;&s;ed with the finger, will pit. The &s;well|ing gradually a&s;cends towards the belly, which at length grows big. When it is &s;truck with the hand, a fluctuation may be felt, and &s;ometimes heard. Afterwards the breath|ing becomes difficult, the urine is in &s;mall quantity, and the thir&s;t great, the belly is bound, and the per&s;piration is greatly ob&s;tructed. To the&s;e &s;ucceed torpor, heavine&s;s, a &s;low wa&s;ting fever, and a trouble&s;ome cough. This la&s;t is generally a fatal &s;ymptom, as it &s;hews the lungs to be affected. In a tympany, the belly when &s;truck &s;ounds like a drum.</P>
<P>WHEN the di&s;ea&s;e comes &s;uddenly on, and the patient is young and &s;trong, there is rea&s;on to hope for a cure, e&s;pe|cially if medicine be given early. But if the patient be old, has led an irregular or a &s;edentary life, or if there be rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the liver, lungs, or any of the vi&s;cera are un|found, there is great ground to fear that the con&s;equences will prove fatal.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;The patient mu&s;t ab&s;tain, as much as po&s;&s;ible, from all drink, e&s;pecially weak and wa|tery liquors, and mu&s;t quench his thir&s;t with acids, as juice of lemons, oranges, &s;orrel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> His aliment ought to be dry, of a heating and diuretic quality, as toa&s;ted bread, the fle&s;h of birds, or other wild animals, roa&s;ted; pungent and aromatic vegetables, as garlic, mu&s;tard, onions, cre&s;&s;es, hor&s;eradi&s;h, rocambole, &s;halot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They may al&s;o eat &s;ea bi&s;cuit, dipt in wine or brandy. This is not only nou|ri&s;hing, but tends to quench thir&s;t. Some have been actu|ally cured of a drop&s;y by a total ab&s;tinence from all liquids, and living entirely upon &s;uch things as are mentioned above. If the patient mu&s;t have drink, the Spaw water, or Rheni&s;h wine, with diuretic medicines infu&s;ed in it, are the be&s;t.</P>
<P>EXERCISE is of the greate&s;t importance in a drop&s;y. If the patient be able to walk, run, dance, or jump about, he ought to continue the&s;e exerci&s;es as long as he can. If he be not able to walk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he mu&s;t ride on hor&s;eback, or in a machine, and the more violent the motion &s;o much the better, provided he can bear it. His bed ought to be hard, and the air of his apartments warm and dry. If he lives in a damp country, he ought to be removed into a dry one,
<PB N="266" REF="012338_0270_0F88EA6E74DF2800">
and, if po&s;&s;ible, into a warmer climate. In a word, every method mu&s;t be taken to promote the per&s;piration and to brace the &s;olids. For this purpo&s;e, it will likewi&s;e be proper to rub the patient's body two or three times a-day, with a hard cloth or the fle&s;h bru&s;h, and he ought con&s;tantly to wear flan|nel next his &s;kin.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;If the patient be young, his con&s;titution good, and the di&s;ea&s;e has come on &s;uddenly, it may generally be removed by &s;trong vomits, bri&s;k purges, and &s;uch medicines as promote a di&s;charge of &s;weat and urine. For an adult, half a dram of ipecacuanha in pow|der, and half an ounce of oxymel of &s;quills, will be a pro|per vomit. This may be repeated three or four times, if nece&s;&s;ary, three or four days intervening betwixt each do&s;e. The patient mu&s;t not drink much after the vomit, other|wi&s;e he de&s;troys its effect. A cup or two of camomile tea will be &s;ufficient to work it off.</P>
<P>BETWIXT each vomit, on one of the intermediate days, the patient may take the following purge. Take jalap in powder half a dram, cream of tartar two drams, calomel &s;ix grains. The&s;e may be made into a bolus with a little &s;yrup of pale ro&s;es, and taken early in the morning. The le&s;s the patient drinks after it the better. If he be much griped, he may take now and then a cup of chicken broth.</P>
<P>THE patient may likewi&s;e take every night at bedtime the following bolus: Take four or five grains of camphire, one grain of opium, and as much &s;yrup of orange peel as is &s;ufficient to make them into a bolus. This will generally promote a gentle &s;weat, which &s;hould be encouraged by drinking now and then a &s;mall cup of wine whey, with a tea &s;poonful of the &s;pirits of hart&s;horn in it.</P>
<P>THE patient may take, three of four times a-day, a tea cupful of the following infu&s;ion: Take juniper berries, mu&s;tard &s;eed, and hor&s;e radi&s;h, of each half an ounce, a&s;hes of broom half a pound; infu&s;e them in a quart of Rheni&s;h wine or &s;trong ale for a few days, and afterwards &s;train of the liquor. Such as cannot take this infu&s;ion, may u&s;e the de|coction of Seneca root, which is both diuretic and &s;udorific. It may be prepared and taken as directed in page 119.</P>
<P>AS this di&s;ea&s;e is very apt to return; after the water has been drained off, to prevent its collecting again, the patient mu&s;t continue to take exerci&s;e, to u&s;e a dry diet, and &s;uch medicines as &s;trengthen and brace the &s;olids, as wine with &s;teel or bark infu&s;ed in it; warm and aromatic bitters are
<PB N="267" REF="012338_0271_0F88EA6F2BD83A58">
likewi&s;e proper, as the Virginian &s;nakeroot, <HI>canella alba,</HI> orange peel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> infu&s;ed in wine or brandy: The patient mu&s;t avoid all great evacuations, and ought, if he can, to make choice of a dry warm &s;ituation.</P>
<P>THE above cour&s;e will often cure an incidental drop&s;y, if the con&s;titution be good; but when the di&s;ea&s;e proceeds from a bad habit, or an unfound &s;tate of the vi&s;cera, &s;trong purges and vomits are not to be ventured upon. In this ca&s;e, the &s;afer cour&s;e is to palliate the &s;ymptoms by the u&s;e of &s;uch medicines as promote the &s;ecretions, and to &s;upport the patient's &s;trength by warm and nouri&s;hing cor|dials.</P>
<P>THE di&s;charge of urine may be greatly promoted by ni|tre. Brookes &s;ays, he knew a young woman who was cured of a drop&s;y by taking a dram of nitre every morning in a draught of ale, after &s;he had been given over as incu|rable. The powder of &s;quills is likewi&s;e a good diuretic. Six or eight grains of it, with a &s;cruple of nitre, may be given twice a-day in a gla&s;s of &s;trong cinnamon water. Ball &s;ays, a large &s;poonful of unbrui&s;ed mu&s;tard &s;eed taken every night and morning, and drinking half an Engli&s;h pint of the decoction of the tops of green broom after it, has produced a cure, after other powerful methods had proved ineffectual.</P>
<P>TO promote per&s;piration, the patient may u&s;e the de|coction of Seneca root, as directed above; or he may take two &s;poonfuls of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THIS &s;pirit is prepared by gradually pouring di&s;tilled vinegar upon any quantity of the volatile <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">al ammoniac till the efferve&s;cence cea&s;es, occa&s;ionally &s;haking the ve&s;&s;el to promote the action of the vinegar on the &s;alt.</NOTE> Mindererus's &s;pirit, in a cup of wine whey, three of four times a-day. The &s;aline draughts re|commended in page 105, are likewi&s;e very proper in this ca&s;e. The&s;e medicines, with the regimen mentioned above, if they do not cure, will, at lea&s;t, alleviate the di&s;ea&s;e, which, in worn out con&s;titutions, is a &s;afer cour&s;e than at|tempting to extirpate it. When other means fail, re|cour&s;e mu&s;t be had to tapping, which is a &s;afe and ea&s;y ope|ration, though it &s;eldom produces a radical cure.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no di&s;ea&s;e which &s;hews the imperfection of the medical art more than the gout. Nor does any malady
<PB N="268" REF="012338_0272_0F88EA7027DDFE60">
&s;hew the advantages of temperance and exerci&s;e in a &s;tronger light. Few who pay a proper regard to the&s;e are troubled with the gout, unle&s;s when it is hereditary. This points out the true &s;ource from whence that pe&s;t originally &s;prung, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>exce&s;s</HI> and <HI>idlene&s;s.</HI> Few per&s;ons are affected with the gout till the decline of life, except tho&s;e who inherit it from their parents. Men are more liable to it than wo|men, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a full, gro&s;s habit.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;One very common cau&s;e of the gout is a hereditary di&s;po&s;ition. Per&s;ons who know them&s;elves to be tainted this way, ought therefore to guard again&s;t its attack, by &s;teadily pur&s;uing a cour&s;e directly oppo&s;ite to that which occa&s;ions the di&s;ea&s;e. Full living, but e&s;peci|ally indulging in rich, pungent, or &s;timulating &s;auces and generous wines, has a great tendency to bring on the gout. Inten&s;e thought, or application of the mind to ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ub|jects, particularly night &s;tudies, has likewi&s;e this effect. The plentiful u&s;e of acids, as &s;our punch, prickt wines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are al&s;o hurtful; but nothing more certainly induces this di&s;ea&s;e than exce&s;s of venery, e&s;pecially in the early period of life.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the gout has been known to prove infecti|ous; but this is rarely the ca&s;e. It may proceed from an ob&s;truction or defect of any of the u&s;ual di&s;charges, as the per&s;piration, &s;weating of the feet, the men&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A &s;udden chilling of the fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t after &s;weat, or drying them at the fire after being wet and cold, are likewi&s;e bad. The modern cu&s;tom of eating a hot fle&s;h &s;upper, drinking warm &s;trong liquors after it, and &s;itting up the greater part of the night, is one very great cau&s;e of the gout, and indeed of many other di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;A fit of the gout is generally preceded by indige&s;tion, drow&s;ine&s;s, wind, a &s;light head-ach, &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;ometimes vomiting. The patient com|plains of wearine&s;s and dejection of &s;pirits, and has often a pain in the limbs, with a &s;en&s;ation as if wind or cold water were pa&s;&s;ing down the thigh. The appetite is often re|markably keen a day or two before the fit, and there is a &s;light pain in pa&s;&s;ing urine, and &s;ometimes an involuntary &s;hedding of tears. Sometimes the&s;e &s;ymptoms are much more violent, e&s;pecially upon the near approach of the fit; and &s;ome ob&s;erve, that as the fever which u&s;hers in the gout is, &s;o will the fit be; if the fever be &s;hort and &s;harp, the fit will be &s;o likewi&s;e; if it be feeble, long, and lingering,
<PB N="269" REF="012338_0273_0F88EA70AB3DB3C0">
the fit will be &s;uch al&s;o. But this ob&s;ervation can only hold with re&s;pect to very regular fits of the gout.</P>
<P>THE regular gout generally makes its attack in the &s;pring, or beginning of winter, in the following manner: About two or three in the morning, the patient is &s;eized with a pain in his great toe, &s;ometimes in the heel, and at other times in the ancle or calf of the leg. This pain is accom|panied with a &s;en&s;ation, as if cold water were poured upon the part, which is &s;ucceeded by a &s;hivering, with &s;ome de|grees of fever. Afterwards the pain increa&s;es, and fixing among the &s;mall bones of the foot, the patient feels all the different kinds of torture, as if the part were &s;tretched, burnt, &s;queezed, gnawed, or torn in pieces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The part at length becomes &s;o exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible, that the pa|tient cannot bear to have it touched, nor even &s;uffer any per&s;on to walk acro&s;s the room.</P>
<P>THE patient is generally in exqui&s;ite torture for twenty-four hours, from the time of the coming on of the fit: He then becomes ea&s;ier, the part begins to &s;well, appears red, and is covered with a little moi&s;ture. Towards morning he drops a&s;leep, and generally falls into a gentle breathing &s;weat. This terminates the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m, a number of which con&s;titutes a fit of the gout; which is longer or &s;horter according to the patient's age, &s;trength, the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the body to this di&s;|ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE patient is always wor&s;e towards night, and ea&s;ier in the morning. The paroxy&s;ms however generally grow milder every day, till at length the matter is di&s;charged by per&s;piration, urine, and the other evacuations. In &s;ome patients this happens in a few days; in others it requires weeks, and in &s;ome months, to fini&s;h the fit. Tho&s;e whom age and frequent fits of the gout have greatly debili|tated, &s;eldom get free of it before the approach of &s;ummer, and &s;ometimes not till it be pretty far advanced.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;As there are no medicines, yet known, that will cure the gout, we &s;hall confine our ob|&s;ervations mo&s;tly to regimen, both in and out of the fit.</P>
<P>IN THE FIT, if the patient be young and &s;trong, his diet ought to be thin and cooling, and his drink of a diluting nature; but where the con&s;titution is weak, and the pati|ent has been accu&s;tomed to live high, this is not a proper time to retrench. In this ca&s;e, he mu&s;t keep nearly to his u&s;ual diet, and &s;hould take frequently a cup of &s;trong negas,
<PB N="270" REF="012338_0274_0F88EA76C8127F70">
or a gla&s;s of generous wine. Wine whey is a very proper drink in this ca&s;e, as it promotes the per&s;piration without heating the patient. It will an&s;wer this purpo&s;e better, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a tea &s;poonful of <HI>&s;al volatile oleo&s;um,</HI> or &s;pirits of hart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">horn, be put into a cup of it twice or thrice a-day. It will likewi&s;e be proper for the patient to take at bed time a tea &s;poonful of the volatile tincture of <HI>guaiacum</HI> in a large draught of warm wine whey. This will greatly promote per&s;piration through the night.</P>
<P>AS we know no &s;afe way of di&s;charging the gouty matter but by per&s;piration, this ought to be kept up by all means, e&s;pecially in the part affected. For this purpo&s;e, the leg and foot affected &s;hould be wrapt in &s;oft flannel, for or wool. The la&s;t is mo&s;t readily obtained, and &s;eems to an|&s;wer the purpo&s;e as well, if not better, than any thing el&s;e. The people of Lanca&s;hire look upon wool as a kind of &s;pe|cific in the gout. They wrap a great quantity of it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">b|ed about the leg and foot affected, and cover it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of &s;hamoy leather. This they &s;uffer to continue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> eight or ten days, and &s;ometimes for a fortnight or three weeks, or longer if the pain does not cea&s;e. I never knew any external application an&s;wer &s;o well in the gout. I have of|ten &s;een it applied when the &s;welling and inflammation were very great, with violent pain; and have found all the&s;e &s;ymptoms relieved by it in a few days. The wool which they u&s;e is generally grea&s;ed, and carded or combed. They choo&s;e the &s;ofte&s;t which can be had, and &s;eldom or never remove it till the fit be entirely gone off.</P>
<P>THE patient ought likewi&s;e to be kept quiet and ea&s;y during the fit. Every thing that affects the mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the paroxy&s;m, and tends to throw the gout upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> parts. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, all external applications that repel the matter are to be avoided as death. They do not cure the di&s;ea&s;e, but remove it from a &s;afe to a more dangerous part of the body, where it often proves fatal. A fit of the gout is rather to be con&s;idered as Nature's me|thod of curing a di&s;ea&s;e than a di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf, and all that we can do, with &s;afety, is to promote her intentions, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in expelling the enemy in her own way. Evacu|ations by bleeding, &s;tool, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are likewi&s;e hurtful. They do not remove the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, and by weakening the patient, they generally prolong the fit.</P>
<P>MANY things will indeed &s;horten a fit of the gout, and &s;ome will drive it off altogether; but nothing has yet been
<PB N="271" REF="012338_0275_0F88EA77704C6140">
found which will do this with &s;afety to the patient. In pain we eagerly gra&s;p at any thing that promi&s;es immediate ea&s;e, and even hazard life it&s;elf for a momentary relief. This is the true rea&s;on why &s;o many infallible remedies have been propo&s;ed for the gout, and why &s;uch numbers have lo&s;t their lives by them. It would be as prudent to &s;top the &s;mall-pox from ri&s;ing, and to drive them into the blood, as to attempt to repel the gout. The latter is as much an effort of Nature to free her&s;elf from an offending cau&s;e as the former, and ought equally to be promoted. In fine, there is no di&s;ea&s;e which Nature makes a greater effort to cure than the gout; nor is it difficult to &s;ee which way her endeavours tend. She always attempts to throw the di&s;ea&s;e upon the extremities, and when that is accom|pli&s;hed, her work is half done. It may &s;afely lodge there till it be gradually expelled by the vital powers, and it can|not lodge &s;afely any where el&s;e, nor be expelled in any other way.</P>
<P>AFTER the fit is over, the patient ought to take a do&s;e or two of the bitter tincture of rhubarb, or &s;ome other warm &s;tomachic purge. He &s;hould al&s;o drink a weak in|fu&s;ion of &s;tomachic bitters, in &s;mall wine or ale; as genti|an, with cinnamon, or Virginian &s;nakeroot, and orange peel. The diet at this time &s;hould be light, but nouri&s;h|ing, and gentle exerci&s;e &s;hould be taken on hor&s;eback, or in a machine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>OUT OF THE FIT, it is in the patient's power to do ma|ny things towards preventing a return of the di&s;order, or rendering the fit, if it &s;hould return, le&s;s &s;evere. This, however, is not to be attempted by medicine. I have fre|quently known the gout kept off for &s;everal years, by the Je&s;uits bark, and other medicines; but in all the ca&s;es where I had occa&s;ion to &s;ee this tried, the per&s;ons died &s;uddenly, and, to all appearance, for want of a regular fit of the gout. One would be apt, from hence, to con|clude, that a fit of the gout, to &s;ome con&s;titutions, in the decline of life, is rather &s;alutary than hurtful.</P>
<P>THOUGH it may be dangerous to &s;top a fit of the gout by medicine, yet if the con&s;titution can be &s;o changed by diet and exerci&s;e, as to le&s;&s;en or totally prevent its return, there certainly can be no danger in following &s;uch a cour&s;e. It is well known that the whole humours may be &s;o altered by a proper cour&s;e of diet, as quite to eradicate this di&s;ea&s;e;
<PB N="272" REF="012338_0276_0F88EA784DC84260">
and tho&s;e only who have re&s;olution enough to per&s;i&s;t in &s;uch a cour&s;e have rea&s;on to expect a cure.</P>
<P>THE cour&s;e which we would recommend for preventing the gout, is as follows: In the fir&s;t place, <HI>univer&s;al tempe|rance.</HI> In the next place, plenty of <HI>exerci&s;e.</HI> By this we do not mean &s;auntering about in an indolent manner, but labour, &s;weat, and toil. The&s;e only can render the hu|mours whole&s;ome, and keep them &s;o. Going early to bed, and ri&s;ing by times, are of great importance. It is like|wi&s;e proper to avoid night &s;tudies, and all inten&s;e thought. The &s;upper &s;hould be light, and taken early. All &s;trong liquors, e&s;pecially generous wines and &s;our punch, are to be avoided. Above all, we would recommend a milk diet. The u&s;e of milk is not to be gone into all at once, but in|crea&s;ed gradually, till it becomes the principal part of the diet.</P>
<P>WE would likewi&s;e recommend &s;ome do&s;es of <HI>magne&s;ia alba</HI> and rhubarb to be taken every &s;pring and autumn; and afterwards a cour&s;e of &s;tomachic bitters, as tan&s;y or water trefoil tea&punc; an infu&s;ion of gentian and camomile flowers, or a decoction of burdock root, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Any of the&s;e, or an infu&s;ion of any whole&s;ome bitter that is more agreeable to the patient, may be drank for two or three weeks twice a-day. An i&s;&s;ue or perpetual bli&s;ter has a great tendency to prevent the gout. If the&s;e were not ge|nerally u&s;ed, in the decline of life, they would not only often prevent the gout, but al&s;o many other mala|dies. Such as can afford to go to Bath will find great be|nefit from bathing and drinking the water. It both pro|motes dige&s;tion and invigorates the habit.</P>
<P>WHEN the gout attacks the head or lungs, every me|thod mu&s;t be taken to draw it towards the feet. They mu&s;t be frequently bathed in warm water, and acrid catapla&s;ms applied to the &s;oles. Bli&s;tering pla&s;ters ought likewi&s;e to be applied to the ancles or calves of the legs. Bleeding in the feet or ancles is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and warm &s;tomachic purges. The patient ought to keep in bed for the mo&s;t part, if there be any &s;igns of inflammation, and &s;hould be very careful not to catch cold.</P>
<P>IF it attacks the &s;tomach with a &s;en&s;e of cold, the mo&s;t warm cordials are nece&s;&s;ary; as &s;trong wine&punc; cinnamon water, peppermint water, and even brandy or rum. The patient &s;hould keep in bed, and endeavour to promote a &s;weat by drinking warm liquors; and if he &s;hould be trou|bled
<PB N="273" REF="012338_0277_0F88EA78EADD3C70">
with a nau&s;ea, or inclination to vomit, he may drink camomile tea or &s;mall po&s;&s;et.</P>
<P>WHEN the gout attacks the kidneys, and imitates gravel pains, the patient ought to drink freely of a decoction of mar&s;hmallows, and to have the parts fomented with warm water. An emollient cly&s;ter ought likewi&s;e to be given, and afterwards an opiate. If the pain be very violent, twenty or thirty drops of laudanum may be taken in a cup of the decoction.</P>
<P>PERSONS who have had the gout &s;hould be very attentive to any complaints that may happen to them about the time when they have rea&s;on to expect a return of the fit. The gout imitates many other di&s;orders, and by being mi&s;taken for them, and treated accordingly, is often diverted from its proper cour&s;e, to the great danger of the patient's life.</P>
<P>THOSE who never had the gout, but who, from their con&s;titution or manner of living, have rea&s;on to expect it, ought likewi&s;e to be very circum&s;pect with regard to its fir&s;t approach. If the di&s;ea&s;e by wrong conduct or im|proper medicines, be diverted from its proper cour&s;e, the mi&s;erable patient has a chance to be ever after tormented with headachs, coughs, pains of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines; and generally falls, at la&s;t, a victim to its attack upon &s;ome of the more noble parts.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE RHEUMATISM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e has great affinity with the gout. It gene|rally attacks the joints with exqui&s;ite pain, and is &s;ome|times attended with inflammation and &s;welling. It is mo&s;t common in the &s;pring and towards the end of autumn. It is u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;hed into acute and chronic; or the rheumati&s;m attended with a fever, and that which is not.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;The cau&s;es of a rheumati&s;m are fre|quently the &s;ame as tho&s;e of an inflammatory fever, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> an ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, the immoderate u&s;e of &s;trong liquors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Sudden changes of the weather, and all quick tran&s;itions from heat to cold, are very apt to occa&s;i|on the rheumati&s;m. The mo&s;t extraordinary ca&s;e of a rheumati&s;m that I ever &s;aw, where almo&s;t every joint of the body was di&s;torted, was in a man who u&s;ed to work one part of the day by the fire, and the other part of it in the
<PB N="274" REF="012338_0278_0F88EA79F66B3E70">

water. Very ob&s;tinate rheumati&s;ms have likewi&s;e been brought on by per&s;ons, not accu&s;tomed to it, allowing their feet to continue long wet. The &s;ame effects are of|ten produced by wet cloaths, damp beds, or lying upon the ground, e&s;pecially in the night.</P>
<P>THE rheumati&s;m may either be occa&s;ioned by exce&s;&s;ive evacuations or the &s;toppage of u&s;ual di&s;charges. It is often the effect of chronic di&s;ea&s;es, which vitiate the humours; as the &s;curvy, the <HI>lues venerea,</HI> ob&s;tinate autumnal agues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE rheumati&s;m prevails mo&s;t in low, damp, mar&s;hy countries. It is likewi&s;e very common among&s;t the poor|er &s;ort of pea&s;ants, who are ill clothed, live in low, cold hou&s;es, and eat coar&s;e unwhole&s;ome food, which contains but little nouri&s;hment, and is not ea&s;y a&s;&s;imilated.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;The <HI>acute</HI> rheumati&s;m com|monly begins with wearine&s;s, &s;hivering, a quick pul&s;e, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, thir&s;t, and other &s;ymptoms of fever. After|wards the patient complains of flying pains, which are in|crea&s;ed by the lea&s;t motion. The&s;e at length fix in the joints, which are often affected with &s;welling and inflam|mation. If blood be let in this di&s;ea&s;e, it has generally the &s;ame appearance as in the pleuri&s;y.</P>
<P>IN this kind of rheumati&s;m the treatment of the patient is nearly the &s;ame as in an acute or inflammatory fever. If he be young and &s;trong, bleeding is nece&s;&s;ary, which may be repeated according to the exigencies of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>THE belly ought likewi&s;e to be kept open by emollient cly&s;ters, or cool opening liquors; as decoctions of tama|rinds and liquorice, cream of tartar, whey, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The diet &s;hould be light, and in &s;mall quantity, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of roa&s;ted apples groat gruel, or very weak chicken broth. After the feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms have abated, if the pain &s;till continues, the patient mu&s;t keep his bed, and take &s;uch things as promote per&s;piration; as wine whey with <HI>&s;pi|ritus Mendereri,</HI> in the manner directed in page 267. The patient may likewi&s;e take, for a few nights, at bed time, in a cup of wine whey, a dram of cream of tartar, and half a dram of gum guaiacum in powder.</P>
<P>WARM bathing, after proper evacuations, has often an exceeding good effect. The patient may either be put in|to a bath of warm water, or have cloths wrung out of it applied to the parts affected. Great care mu&s;t be taken that he do not catch cold after bathing.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="012338_0279_0F88EA7A6A979468">
THE <HI>chronic</HI> rheumati&s;m is &s;eldom attended with any con|&s;iderable degree of fever, and is generally confined to &s;ome particular part of the body, as the &s;houlders, the back, or the loins. There is &s;eldom any inflammation or &s;welling in this ca&s;e. Per&s;ons in the decline of life are mo&s;t &s;ubject to the chronic rheumati&s;m. In &s;uch patients it often proves extremely ob&s;tinate, and &s;ometimes incurable.</P>
<P>IN this kind of rheumati&s;m the regimen &s;hould be nearly the &s;ame as in the acute. Cool and diluting diet, con&s;i&s;t|ing chiefly of vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, as &s;tewed prunes, cod|dled apples, currants or goo&s;eberries boiled in milk, is mo&s;t proper. Arbuth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot &s;ays, <Q>If there be a &s;pecific in aliment for the rheumati&s;m, it is certainly whey;</Q> and adds, <Q>That he knew a per&s;on &s;ubject to this di&s;ea&s;e, who could never be cured by any other method but a diet of whey and bread.</Q> He likewi&s;e &s;ays, <Q>That cream of tartar in water gruel, taken for &s;everal days, will ea&s;e rheumatic pains con&s;iderably.</Q> This I have often ex|perienced, but found it always more efficacious when join|ed with gum guaiacum, as directed above. In this ca&s;e the pa|tient may take the do&s;e mentioned above twice a-day, and likewi&s;e a tea &s;poonful of the volatile tincture of gum gu|aiacum at bed time in wine whey.</P>
<P>THIS cour&s;e may be continued for a week, or longer, if the ca&s;e proves ob&s;tinate, and the patient's &s;trength will permit. It ought then to be omitted for a few days, and repeated again. At the &s;ame time, leeches or a bli&s;tering pla&s;ter may be applied to the part affected. What I have generally found an&s;wer better than either of the&s;e, in ob&s;ti|nate fixed rheumatic pains, is the <HI>warm pla&s;ter.</HI> It is made by melting over a gentle fire, an ounce of gum pla&s;ter, with two drams of bli&s;tering pla&s;ter. This may be &s;pread upon &s;oft leather, and applied to the part affected. It &s;hould be taken off and wiped every three or four days, and may be renewed once a fortnight. Cupping upon the part af|fected is likewi&s;e often beneficial, and is greatly preferable to the application of leeches.</P>
<P>THOUGH this di&s;ea&s;e may not &s;eem in the lea&s;t to yield to medicines for a long time, yet they ought &s;till to be per|&s;i&s;ted in. Per&s;ons who are &s;ubject to frequent returns of the rheumati&s;m, will often find their account in u&s;ing me|dicines, whether they be immediately affected with it or not. The chronic rheumati&s;m is &s;imilar to the gout in
<PB N="276" REF="012338_0280_0F88EA7D68885F90">
this re&s;pect, that the mo&s;t proper time for u&s;ing medicines to extirpate it, is when the patient is mo&s;t free from it.</P>
<P>TO tho&s;e who can afford to go thither, we would re|commend the warm baths of Buxton or Matlock in Der|by&s;hire. The&s;e have often cured very ob&s;tinate rheuma|ti&s;ms, and are always &s;afe either in or out of the fit. When the rheumati&s;m is complicated with &s;corbutic com|plaints, which is not &s;eldom the ca&s;e, the Harrowgate wa|ters and tho&s;e of Moffat are proper. They &s;hould both be drank and u&s;ed as a warm bath.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal of our own dome&s;tic plants which may be u&s;ed with advantage in the rheumati&s;m. One of the be&s;t of them is the white mu&s;tard &s;eed. A table &s;poon|ful of this may be taken twice or thrice a-day, in a gla&s;s of water or &s;mall wine. The water trefoil is likewi&s;e of great u&s;e in this complaint. It may be infu&s;ed in wine or ale, or drank in form of tea. The ground-ivy, camo|mile, and &s;everal other bitters, are al&s;o beneficial, and may be u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner. No benefit however is to be expected from the&s;e unle&s;s they be u&s;ed for a con&s;ider|able time. Excellent medicines are often de&s;pi&s;ed in this ca&s;e, becau&s;e they do not perform a cure in&s;tantaneou&s;ly; whereas nothing would be more certain than their effect, were they duly per&s;i&s;ted in. The want of per&s;everance in the u&s;e of medicines is one great cau&s;e why chronic di&s;ea|&s;es are &s;o &s;eldom cured.</P>
<P>COLD bathing, e&s;pecially in &s;alt water, often cures the rheumati&s;m. We would al&s;o recommend riding on hor&s;eback, and wearing flannel next the &s;kin. A flannel &s;hirt, in an ob&s;tinate rheumati&s;m, e&s;pecially if the patient be old, is one of the be&s;t medicines we know. I&s;&s;ues are likewi&s;e very proper; they have often been known to cure a chro|nic rheumati&s;m. If the pain affects the &s;houlders, an i&s;&s;ue may be made in the arm; but if it affects the loins, it &s;hould be put in the leg or thigh. Rheumatic per&s;ons ought to make choice of a dry warm air, to avoid wet cloaths as much as po&s;&s;ible, and make frequent u&s;e of the fle&s;h-bru&s;h.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE SCURVY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e prevails chiefly in cold northern countries, e&s;pecially in low damp &s;ituations, near large mar&s;hes, or
<PB N="277" REF="012338_0281_0F88EA7D802E0928">
great quantities of &s;tagnating water. Sedentary people, of a dull melancholy di&s;po&s;ition are mo&s;t &s;ubject to it. It proves often fatal to &s;ailors in long voyages, particularly in &s;hips that are not properly ventilated, and have many peo|ple on board.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;The &s;curvy is occa&s;ioned by cold moi&s;t air, by the long u&s;e of &s;alted or &s;moke-dried provi&s;i|ons, or of any kind of food that is hard of dige&s;tion, and affords little nouri&s;hment. It may al&s;o proceed from ex|ce&s;&s;ive evacuations, or the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of cu&s;tomary di&s;|charges; as the <HI>men&s;es,</HI> haemorrhoidal flux, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is &s;ometimes owing to a hereditary taint, in which ca&s;e a very &s;mall cau&s;e will excite the latent di&s;order. Grief, fear, and other depre&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;ions, have a great tendency to pro|duce this di&s;ea&s;e. It may likewi&s;e proceed from neglect of cleanline&s;s, bad cloathing, the want of proper exerci&s;e, con|fined air, exce&s;s in eating or drinking, or from any di&s;|ea&s;e which greatly weakens the body, or vitiates the hu|mours.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;This di&s;ea&s;e may be known by unu&s;ual wearine&s;s, heavine&s;s of the body, and difficulty of breathing, e&s;pecially after bodily motion; rottenne&s;s of the gums, which are apt to bleed on the &s;lighte&s;t touch&punc; a &s;tinking breath, frequent bleeding of the no&s;e, difficulty of walking; &s;ometimes a &s;welling, and &s;ometimes a falling away of the legs, on which there are livid, yellow, or vio|let coloured &s;pots; the face is generally of a pale or leaden colour. As the di&s;ea&s;e advances, other &s;ymptoms come on; as rottenne&s;s of the teeth, haemorrhages, or di&s;char|ges of blood from various parts of the body, foul ob&s;tinate ulcers, which no applications will cure; the patient com|plains of pains in various parts of the body, e&s;pecially about the brea&s;t, and his body is covered with dry &s;caly eruptions. At la&s;t a wa&s;ting or hectic fever comes on, and the mi&s;e|rable patient is often carried off by a dy&s;entery, or diarr|hoea, a drop&s;y, the pal&s;y, fainting fits, or a mortification of &s;ome of the bowels.</P>
<P>CURE.&mdash;We know no method of curing this di&s;ea&s;e, but by pur&s;uing a cour&s;e directly oppo&s;ite to that which brought it on. It proceeds from a vitiated &s;tate of the humours, occa&s;ioned by errors in diet, air, or exer|ci&s;e; and this can be removed no other way than by a pro|per attention to the&s;e important articles.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="012338_0282_0F88EA7E2FE0D9E8">
IF the patient has been obliged to breathe a cold, damp, or confined air, he &s;hould be removed, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to a dry, open, and moderately warm one. If the di&s;ea&s;e proceeds from a &s;edentary life, or depre&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;ions, as grief, fear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the patient mu&s;t take daily as much exer|ci&s;e in the open air as he can bear, and his mind &s;hould be diverted by cheerful company and other amu&s;ements. No|thing has a greater tendency either to prevent, or remove this di&s;ea&s;e, than con&s;tant cheerfulne&s;s and good humour. But this, alas, is &s;eldom the lot of per&s;ons afflicted with the &s;curvy; they are generally &s;urly, peevi&s;h, &s;our, mo|ro&s;e, and dull.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;curvy has been brought on by a long u&s;e of &s;alted provi&s;ions, the proper medicine is a diet con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of fre&s;h vegetables; as oranges, lemons, apples, tamarinds, water cre&s;&s;es, &s;curvy gra&s;s, brooklime, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The u&s;e of the&s;e with milk, pot herbs, new bread, and fre&s;h beer or cider, will &s;eldom fail to remove a &s;curvy of this kind, if taken before it be too far advanced; but to have this effect they mu&s;t be per&s;i&s;ted in for a con&s;iderable time. When fre&s;h vegetables cannot be had, pickled or pre&s;erved ones may be u&s;ed; and if the&s;e cannot be obtained, the chymical acids may be taken in their &s;tead. All the pati|ent's food and drink mu&s;t be &s;harpened with cream of tar|tar, elixir of vitriol, vinegar, or the &s;pirit of &s;ea &s;alt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THESE things, however, will more certainly prevent than cure the &s;curvy; for which rea&s;on &s;eafaring people, e&s;pecially on long voyages, ought to lay in plenty of them. Cabbage, onions, goo&s;eberries, and many other vegetables, may be kept a long time by pickling, pre&s;erv|ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When the&s;e fail, the chymical acids, mention|ed above, which will keep for any length of time, may be u&s;ed. We have rea&s;on to believe, if &s;hips were well venti|lated, good &s;tore of fruits, greens, and portable &s;oup, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> laid in, and a proper regard paid to cleanline&s;s and warmth, that &s;ailors would be the mo&s;t healthy people in the world, and would &s;eldom &s;uffer either from the &s;curvy or putrid fevers, which are &s;o fatal to that u&s;eful &s;et of men; but it is too much the temper of &s;uch people to de&s;pi&s;e all precau|tion; they will not think of any calamity till they find it, when it is too late to ward off the blow.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t indeed be owned, that many of them have it not in their power to make the provi&s;ion we are &s;peaking of; but in this ca&s;e it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of their employers to
<PB N="279" REF="012338_0283_0F88EA7EEDC525D8">
make it for them; and no man ought to engage in a long voyage without having this article &s;ecured.</P>
<P>I have often &s;een very extraordinary effects in the &s;curvy from a milk diet. This preparation of nature is a mixture of animal and vegetable properties, which of all others is the mo&s;t fit for re&s;toring a decayed con&s;titution, and re|moving that particular acrimony of the humours, which &s;eems to con&s;titute the very e&s;&s;ence of the &s;urvy, and many other di&s;ea&s;es. But men de&s;pi&s;e this whole&s;ome and nou|ri&s;hing food, becau&s;e it is cheap, and guzzle down fle&s;h, and fermented liquors, while milk is only deemed fit for their hogs.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t proper drink in the &s;curvy is whey or butter|milk. When the&s;e cannot be had, &s;ound cider or perry may be u&s;ed. Wort has been found to be a proper drink in the &s;curvy, and may be u&s;ed at &s;ea, as malt will keep during the longe&s;t voyage. A decoction of the tops of the &s;pruce fir is al&s;o good. It may be drank in the quantity of an Engli&s;h pint twice a-day. Tar water may likewi&s;e be u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e, ordecoctions of any of the mild mucila|ginous vegetables; as &s;ar&s;aparilla, mar&s;hmallow roots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Infu&s;ions of the bitter plants, as ground-ivy, the le&s;&s;er cen|taury, mar&s;h trefoil, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are likewi&s;e beneficial. I have &s;een the pea&s;ants in &s;ome parts of Britain expre&s;s the juice of the la&s;t mentioned plant, and drink it with good effect in tho&s;e foul &s;corbutic eruptions with which they are often troubled in the &s;pring &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE Harrowgate water is certainly an excellent medi|cine in the &s;curvy. I have often &s;een patients in the mo&s;t deplorable condition from that di&s;ea&s;e, greatly relieved by drinking the &s;ulphur water, and bathing in it. The cha|lybeate water may al&s;o be u&s;ed with advantage, e&s;pecially with a view to brace the &s;tomach after drinking the &s;ul|phur water, which, though i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;harpens the appetite, never fails to weaken the power of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>A &s;light degree of &s;curvy may be carried off by frequent|ly &s;ucking a little of the juice of a bitter orange, or lemon. When the di&s;ea&s;e affects the gums only, this practice, if continued for &s;ome time, will generally carry it off. We would, however, recommend the bitter orange as greatly preferable to lemon. It &s;eems to be as good an acid, and is not near &s;o hurtful to the &s;tomach. Perhaps our own &s;orrel may be little inferior to either of them. All kinds of &s;alad are good in the &s;curvy, and ought to be eat in great
<PB N="280" REF="012338_0284_0F88EA7FD6665C18">
plenty; as &s;pinage, lettuce, par&s;ley, celery, endive, ra|di&s;h, dandelion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is amazing to &s;ee how &s;oon fre&s;h vegetables in the &s;pring cure the brute animals of any &s;cab or foulne&s;s which is upon their &s;kins. Is it not natural to &s;uppo&s;e that their effects &s;hould be as great upon the human &s;pecies?</P>
<P>THE LEPROSY, which was &s;o common in this country long ago, &s;eems to have been near akin to the &s;curvy. Perhaps its appearing &s;o &s;eldom now, may be owing to the inhabitants of Britain eating more vegetable food than for|merly, living more upon tea and other diluting diet, u&s;ing far le&s;s &s;alted meat, and being greatly more cleanly and better cloathed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;Where this di&s;ea&s;e happens, we would recommend the &s;ame cour&s;e of diet and medicine as in the &s;curvy.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE SCROPHULA, OR KING's EVIL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e chiefly affects the glands, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the neck. Children and young per&s;ons of a &s;edentary life are mo&s;t &s;ubject to it. It is one of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es that may be removed by proper regimen, but &s;eldom yields to medi|cine. The inhabitants of cold, damp, mar&s;hy countries, are mo&s;t liable to the &s;crophula.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;This di&s;ea&s;e may proceed from a hereditary taint, infection, a &s;crophulous nur&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Children who have the misfortune to be born of &s;ickly pa|rents, who&s;e con&s;titutions have been worn out by the French-pox, or other chronic di&s;ea&s;es, are apt to be affect|ed with the &s;crophula. It may likewi&s;e proceed from &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es as weaken the habit or vitiate the humours, as the &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> External injuries; as blows, brui&s;es, compre&s;&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ometimes produce &s;crophulous ulcers; but there is rea&s;on to believe, when this happens, that it is owing either to a predi&s;po&s;ition in the habit to this di&s;ea&s;e, or to the confinement of the patient. In &s;hort, whatever tends to vitiate the humours, or relax the &s;olids, predi&s;po&s;es to this di&s;ea&s;e; as the want of exerci&s;e, too much heat or cold, confined air, unwhole&s;ome food, bad water, the u&s;e of poor, weak, watery aliments, the neglect of cleanline&s;s, or &s;uffering children to continue long wet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="012338_0285_0F88EA825AEDE008">
SYMPTOMS.&mdash;At fir&s;t &s;mall knots appear under the chin or behind the ears, which gradually increa&s;e in number and &s;ize, till they form one large hard tumour. This often continues for a long time without breaking, and when it does break, it only di&s;charges a thin <HI>&s;anies</HI> or watery humour. Other parts of the body are likewi&s;e lia|ble to its attack, as the arm-pits groins, feet, hands, eyes, brea&s;ts, &amp;c. Nor are the internal parts exempt from it. It often affects the lungs, liver or &s;pleen; and I have fre|quently &s;een the glands of the me&s;entery greatly enlarged by it.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;tinate ulcers which break out upon the feet and hands with &s;welling, and little or no redne&s;s, common|ly called the <HI>&s;pina vento&s;a,</HI> are of the &s;crophulous kind. They &s;eldom di&s;charge good matter, and are exceeding dif|ficult to cure. The <HI>white &s;wellings</HI> of the joints &s;eem like|wi&s;e to be of this kind. They can &s;eldom be brought to a &s;uppuration, and when opened they only di&s;charge a thin ichor. There is not a more general &s;ymptom of the &s;crophu|la than a &s;welling of the upper lip and no&s;e. It likewi&s;e frequently begins in a &s;ingle toe or finger, which continues long &s;welled, with no great degree of pain, till at length the bone becomes carious.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;As this di&s;ea&s;e proceeds, in a great mea&s;ure, from relaxation, the diet ought to be generous and nouri&s;hing, but at the &s;ame time light and of ea&s;y dige&s;tion, as good light bread, the fle&s;h and broth of young animals, with now and then a gla&s;s of generous wine, or good ale. The air ought to be open, dry, and not too cold, and the patient &s;hould take as much exerci&s;e as he can bear. Ex|erci&s;e is here of the utmo&s;t importance. Children will &s;el|dom be troubled with the &s;crophula who have enough of exerci&s;e, and if they be, it alone has the greate&s;t chance to cure them.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;The vulgar are remarkably credulous with regard to the cure of the &s;crophula, many of them be|lieving in the virtue of the royal touch, that of the &s;eventh &s;on, &amp;c. The truth is, we know but little either of the nature or cure of this di&s;ea&s;e, and where rea&s;on or medi|cines fail, &s;uper&s;tition always comes in their place. Hence it is, that in di&s;ea&s;es which are the mo&s;t difficult to under|&s;tand, we always hear of the greate&s;t number of miracu|lous cures being performed. Here, however, the decepti|on
<PB N="282" REF="012338_0286_0F88EA857B10AAA0">
on is ea&s;ily accounted for. The &s;crophula at a certain pe|riod of life, often cures of it&s;elf; and, if the patient hap|pens to be touched about this time, the cure is imputed to the touch, and not to nature, who is really the phy&s;ician. In the &s;ame way the in&s;ignificant no&s;trums of quacks and old women often gain applau&s;e when they de&s;erve none.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing more pernicious, than the cu&s;tom of do&s;ing children with &s;trong purgative medicines in the &s;cro|phula. People imagine, that it proceeds from humours which mu&s;t be purged off, without con&s;idering, that the&s;e purgatives increa&s;e the relaxation and aggravate the di&s;ea&s;e. It has indeed been found that keeping the belly gently open, e&s;pecially with &s;ea-water, has a good effect; but this &s;hould only be given in &s;uch quantity as to procure one, or at mo&s;t two &s;tools every day. Bathing in the &s;alt water has like|wi&s;e a very good effect, e&s;pecially in the warm &s;ea&s;on. I have often known a cour&s;e of bathing in &s;alt-water, and drinking it in &s;uch quantities as to keep the belly gently open, cure a &s;crophula, after many medicines had been tried in vain. When &s;alt-water cannot be had, the patient may be bathed in fre&s;h-water, and his belly kept open by &s;mall quantities of &s;alt and water, or &s;ome other mild pur|gative.</P>
<P>NEXT to cold bathing and drinking the &s;alt-water, we would recommend the je&s;uits bark. The cold bath may be u&s;ed in &s;ummer, and the bark in winter. It may either be taken in &s;ub&s;tance mixed with wine, or if the patient cannot be brought to u&s;e it in that form, a decoction of it may be drank. An ounce of the je&s;uits bark, and a dram of Winter's bark gro&s;sly powdered, may be boiled in an Engli&s;h quart of water to a pint; towards the end, half an ounce of &s;liced liquorice-root, and a handful of rai&s;ins may be added, which will both render the medicine le&s;s di&s;agreeable and make it take up more of the bark. The liquor mu&s;t be &s;trained, and two, three, or four &s;poon|fuls, according to the age of the patient, taken three times a day. The patient ought at the &s;ame time to take, twice or thrice a day, a gla&s;s of good wine, with ten, twenty, or thirty drops of volatile tincture of guaiacum in it. I have often given the bark in ob&s;tinate &s;crophulous ca&s;es with very good effect. An adult may take at lea&s;t two drams of it daily, and mu&s;t continue to u&s;e it for &s;everal months.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="012338_0287_0F88EA8619DD0090">
THE Moffat and Harrowgate waters are likewi&s;e very proper medicines in the &s;crophula, e&s;pecially the latter. They ought not however to be drank in large quantities, but &s;hould be taken &s;o as to keep the belly gently open, and mu&s;t be u&s;ed for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>AS to external applications, they are of little avail. Be|fore the tumour breaks, nothing ought to be applied to it, unle&s;s a piece of flannel, or &s;omething to keep it warm. After it breaks, the &s;ore may be dre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome dige&s;tive ointment. What I have always found to an&s;wer be&s;t, was the yellow ba&s;ilicon mixed with about a &s;ixth or eighth part of its weight of red precipitate. The &s;ore may be dre&s;&s;ed with this twice a day; and if it be very fungous, and does not dige&s;t well, a larger proportion of the preci|pitate may be added.</P>
<P>MEDICINES which mitigate this di&s;ea&s;e, tho' they do not cure it, are not to be de&s;pi&s;ed. If the patient can be kept alive by any means till he arrives at the age of puberty, he he has a great chance to get well; but if he does not reco|ver at this time, in all probability he never will. Per&s;ons afflicted with this di&s;ea&s;e ought not to marry. There is no malady which parents are &s;o apt to communicate to their off&s;pring as the &s;crophula, and &s;urely it is a cruel thing to entail mi&s;ery on po&s;terity.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF THE RICKETS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e generally attacks children betwixt the age of nine months and two years. It appeared fir&s;t in Eng|land, about the time when manufactures began to be in|troduced, and &s;till prevails mo&s;t in towns where the inha|bitants follow &s;edentary employments, and by that means neglect either to take proper exerci&s;e them&s;elves, or to give it to their children. It has a great re&s;emblance to the foregoing di&s;ea&s;e both in its cau&s;es and method of cure.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;One cau&s;e of the rickets in children is di&s;ea&s;ed parents. Mothers of a weak relaxed habit, who neglect exerci&s;e, and live upon weak watery diet, can nei|ther be expected to bring forth &s;trong and healthy children, nor to be able to nur&s;e them, after they are brought forth.
<PB N="284" REF="012338_0288_0F88EA86D3044170">
Accordingly we find, that the children of &s;uch women ge|nerally die of the rickets, the &s;crophula, con&s;umptions, &amp;c. Children begotten by men in the decline of life, who are afflicted with the gout, the gravel, or other chronic di&s;|ea&s;es, or who have been often affected with the venereal di&s;|ea&s;e in their youth, are likewi&s;e liable to the rickets.</P>
<P>ANY di&s;order that weakens the con&s;titution, or relaxes the habit of children, as the &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, teething, the hooping-cough, &amp;c. predi&s;po&s;es them to this di&s;ea&s;e. It may likewi&s;e be occa&s;ioned by improper diet, as food that is either too weak and watery, or &s;o vi&s;cid that the &s;tomach cannot dige&s;t it. Too great a quantity of rich and nouri&s;hing diet may likewi&s;e vitiate the humours and occa|&s;ion the rickets. Bad nur&s;ing is often the cau&s;e of this di&s;|ea&s;e. When the nur&s;e is either di&s;ea&s;ed, or has not enough of milk to nouri&s;h the child, it mu&s;t &s;uffer. But children &s;uffer oftner by want of care in nur&s;es than want of food. Allowing an infant to continue long wet, or not keeping it thoroughly clean in its cloaths, &amp;c. has the mo&s;t pernici|ous effects. Wet &s;hoes, &s;tocking, and other cloaths, re|lax the bodies of children, and greatly ob&s;truct their growth. The want of free air, is likewi&s;e very hurtful to children in this re&s;pect. A nur&s;e who lives in a clo&s;e, &s;mall hou&s;e, where the air is damp and confined, and who is too in|dolent to carry her child abroad into the open air, will hardly fail to give it the rickets. But want of exerci&s;e is the chief cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e. A healthy child &s;hould al|ways be in motion, unle&s;s when a&s;leep; but if it be &s;uffer|ed to lie, or &s;it, in&s;tead of being to&s;&s;ed and dandled about, it can hardly e&s;cape this baneful malady.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;At the beginning of this di&s;ea&s;e the child's fle&s;h grows &s;oft and flabby; its &s;trength is dimini&s;h|ed; it lo&s;es its wonted cheerfulne&s;s, looks more grave and compo&s;ed than is natural for its age, and does not care to be moved. The head and belly become too large in pro|portion to the other parts; the face appears full, and the complexion florid. Afterwards the bones begin to be affect|ed, e&s;pecially in the more &s;oft and &s;pungy parts, or to|wards the ends. Hence the wri&s;ts and ancles become thick|er than u&s;ual; the &s;pine or back-bone puts on an unnatu|ral &s;hape; the brea&s;t is likewi&s;e often deformed; and the bones of the arms and legs grow crooked. All tho&s;e &s;ymp|toms vary according to the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e. The
<PB N="285" REF="012338_0289_0F88EA872C7C0BD8">
pul&s;e is generally quick, but feeble; the appetite and di|ge&s;tion, for the mo&s;t part, bad; the teeth come &s;lowly and with difficulty, and they often rot and fall out after|wards. Ricketty children generally have great acutene&s;s of mind, and an under&s;tanding above their years. Whether this be owing to their being more in the company of adults than other children, or the enlargement of the brain, we &s;hall not pretend to determine.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;As this di&s;ea&s;e is always attended with evident &s;igns of weakne&s;s and relaxation, our chief aim in the cure mu&s;t be to brace and &s;trengthen the &s;olids, and to promote the dige&s;tion and due preparation of the fluids. The&s;e important ends will be be&s;t promoted by whole&s;ome nouri&s;hing diet, &s;uited to the age and &s;trength of the patient, and often repeated; by open dry air, and plenty of exerci&s;e. If the child has a bad nur&s;e, who ei|ther neglects her duty, or has not enough of milk, &s;he &s;hould be changed. If the &s;ea&s;on be cold, the child ought to be kept warm; and when the weather is hot it ought to be kept cool; as &s;weating is very apt to weaken it; and too great a degree of cold has the &s;ame effect. The limbs &s;hould be rubbed frequently with a warm hand, and the child &s;hould be kept as cheerful as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE diet ought to be light and dry, as good bread, roa&s;ted fle&s;h, &amp;c. Bi&s;cuit is generally reckoned the be&s;t bread; and pigeons, pullets, veal, rabbets, or mutton roa&s;ted or minced, are the mo&s;t proper fle&s;h. If the child be too young for fle&s;h meats, he may have rice, millet, or pearl barley boiled with rai&s;ins, to which may be added a little wine and &s;pice. His drink may be good claret, of which he may take half a gla&s;s three or four times a day. Tho&s;e who cannot afford claret, may give the child now and then a wine gla&s;s of fine mild ale.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;Medicines are here of little avail. The di&s;ea&s;e may often be cured by the nur&s;e, but &s;eldom by the phy&s;ician. In children of a gro&s;s habit, gentle pur|ges or vomits may &s;ometimes be of u&s;e; but they will never carry off the malady. That mu&s;t depend upon bracing a|lone: For which purpo&s;e, be&s;ides the regimen mentioned above, we would recommend the cold bath, e&s;pecially in the warm &s;ea&s;on. It mu&s;t however be admini&s;tred with prudence, as &s;ome ricketty children cannot bear it. The be&s;t time for u&s;ing the cold bath is in the morning, and
<PB N="286" REF="012338_0290_0F88EA880D8BBA48">
the child &s;hould be well rubbed with a dry cloth immedi|ately after. If the child &s;hould be weakened by the u&s;e of the cold bath, it mu&s;t be di&s;continued.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES i&s;&s;ues have been found beneficial both in this and the foregoing di&s;ea&s;e. They are peculiarly nece&s;&s;a|ry for children who abound with gro&s;s humours. An infu|&s;ion of the je&s;uits-bark, in wine or ale, is likewi&s;e of u&s;e; but it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to bring children to take it. We might here mention many other medicines which have been recommended for the rickets; but, as there is far more danger in tru&s;ting to the&s;e than in neglecting them altoge|ther, we chu&s;e rather to pa&s;s them over, and to depend en|tirely on regimen.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF THE ITCH.</HEAD>
<P>THE ITCH is a di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;kin, and is generally com|municated by infection. It &s;eems originally to proceed from the want of cleanline&s;s, bad air, or unwhole&s;ome diet; as the inmates of jails, ho&s;pitals, and &s;uch as live upon &s;alted and &s;moke dried provi&s;ions are &s;eldom free from it.</P>
<P>IT generally appears in form of &s;mall watery pu&s;tules, fir&s;t about the wri&s;ts, or betwixt the fingers, and afterwards it affects the arms, legs, and thighs, &amp;c. The&s;e pu&s;tules are attended with an intolerable itching, e&s;pecially when the patient is warm in bed, or &s;its near the fire. Sometimes the &s;kin is covered with large blotches or &s;cabs, and at o|ther times with a white &s;curf, or &s;caly eruption. This la&s;t is called the dry itch, and is the mo&s;t difficult to cure.</P>
<P>THE itch is &s;eldom a dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, unle&s;s when it is rendered &s;o by neglect or improper treatment. If it be &s;uffered to continue too long, it may vitiate the whole ma&s;s of humours; and, if it be &s;uddenly drove in, without proper evacuations, it may occa&s;ion fevers, inflammations of the vi&s;cera, or other internal di&s;orders.</P>
<P>THE &s;afe&s;t medicine for the itch is &s;ulphur, which ought to be applied both externally and internally. The parts mo&s;t affected may be rubbed with an ointment made of common &s;ulphur and flower of brim&s;tone, each an ounce; crude &s;al ammonia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, finely powdered, two drams; hog's lard, or butter, four ounces. A &s;cruple, or half a dram of of the e&s;&s;ence of lemon may be added, to take away the di&s;agreeable &s;mell. About the bulk of a nutmeg of this
<PB N="287" REF="012338_0291_0F88EA88AEE72FD8">
may be rubbed upon the extremities; at bed-time, twice or thrice a week. It is &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary to rub any part but the extremities, and even the&s;e ought not all to be rubbed at the &s;ame time, but by turns, as it is dangerous to &s;top too many pores at once.</P>
<P>BEFORE the patient begins to u&s;e the ointment, he ought, if he be of a full habit, to bleed and take a purge or two. It will likewi&s;e be proper, during the u&s;e of it, to take e|very night and morning as much of the flower of brim|&s;tone, in a little treacle or new-milk, as will lie upon a &s;hilling. He &s;hould beware of catching cold, &s;hould wear more cloaths than u&s;ual, and take every thing warm. The &s;ame cloaths, the linen excepted, ought to be kept on all the time of u&s;ing the ointment; and &s;uch cloaths, as have been worn while the patient was under the di&s;ea&s;e, are not to be u&s;ed again, unle&s;s they have been fumigated with brim&s;tone, and thoroughly cleaned, otherwi&s;e they will communicate the infection anew.</P>
<P>I never knew brim&s;tone, if u&s;ed as directed above, fail to cure the itch; and I have rea&s;on to believe, that, if du|ly per&s;i&s;ted in, it never will fail: but if it be only u&s;ed once or twice, and cleanline&s;s be neglected, it is no won|der if the di&s;order returns. The great &s;ecret both for pre|venting and curing the itch is CLEANLINESS. Where it prevails, the itch will &s;eldom approach, and if it &s;hould, it will &s;oon be bani&s;hed. The quantity of ointment men|tioned above will generally be &s;ufficient for the cure of one per&s;on; but, if any &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould appear again, the medicine may be repeated. It is both more &s;afe and efficacious when per&s;i&s;ted in for a con&s;iderable time, than when a large quantity is applied at once. It will like|wi&s;e be proper that the patient, while he is u&s;ing the oint|ment, &s;hould take a purge once a week.</P>
<P>PEOPLE ought to be extremely cautious not to mi&s;take o|ther eruptions for the itch; as the &s;toppage of the&s;e may be attended with fatal con&s;equences. Many of the eruptive di&s;ea&s;es to which children are liable, have a near re&s;em|blance to the itch; and I have often known infants killed by being rubbed with grea&s;y ointments that made the&s;e e|ruptions &s;trike &s;uddenly in, which nature had thrown out to pre&s;erve the patient's life, or prevent &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>MUCH michief is likewi&s;e done by the u&s;e of mercu|ry in this di&s;ea&s;e. I have known &s;ome per&s;ons mad enough
<PB N="288" REF="012338_0292_0F88EA896EABE428">
to wa&s;h the parts affected with a &s;trong &s;olution of the cor|ro&s;ive &s;ublimate, which had almo&s;t proved fatal. Others u&s;e the mercurial ointment without taking the lea&s;t care either to avoid cold or ob&s;erve a proper regimen. The con&s;equences of &s;uch conduct may be ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed. I have known even the mercurial girdles produce tragical effects, and would advi&s;e every per&s;on, as he values his health, to beware how he u&s;es them. Mercury ought never to be u&s;ed as a medicine without the greate&s;t care. Ignorant people look upon the&s;e girdles as a kind of charm, without con&s;idering that the mercury enters the blood.</P>
<P>AS &s;ulphur is both the mo&s;t &s;afe and efficacious medicine for the itch, we &s;hall not recommend any other. Other medicines may be u&s;ed by per&s;ons of &s;kill, but are not to be ventured upon by the ignorant. Tho&s;e who would avoid this dete&s;table di&s;ea&s;e ought to beware of infected per&s;ons, to u&s;e whole&s;ome food, and to &s;tudy univer&s;al cleanline&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE ASTHMA.</HEAD>
<P>THE a&s;thma is a di&s;ea&s;e of the lungs, which &s;eldom admits of a cure. Per&s;ons in the decline of life are mo&s;t liable to this di&s;ea&s;e. It is divided into the moi&s;t and dry, or hu|moural and nervous. The former is attended with expec|toration or &s;pitting; but in the latter the patient &s;eldom &s;pits, unle&s;s &s;ometimes a little tough phlegm by the mere force of coughing.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;The a&s;thma is &s;ometimes hereditary. It may likewi&s;e proceed from a bad formation of the brea&s;t; the fumes of metals or minerals taken into the lungs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know a per&s;on who&s;e lungs were &s;et in a manner &s;tock-&s;till, by the fumes of antimony.

In a word, the di&s;ea&s;e may proceed from any cau&s;e that either impedes the circu|lation of the blood through the lungs, or prevents their be|ing duly expanded by the air.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="012338_0293_0F88EA8A5129F390">
SYMPTOMS.&mdash;An a&s;thma is known by a quick laborious re&s;piration, which is generally performed with a kind of wheezing noi&s;e. Sometimes the difficulty of breath|ing is &s;o great that the patient is obliged to keep an erect po&s;ture, otherwi&s;e he is in danger of being &s;uffocated. A fit or paroxi&s;m of the a&s;thma is very apt to happen after a per&s;on has been expo&s;ed to cold ea&s;terly winds, or has been abroad in thick foggy weather, or has got wet, or continu|ed long in a damp place under ground, or the like.</P>
<P>A fit of the a&s;thma is generally u&s;hered in with great li&s;t|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, want of &s;leep, hoar&s;ene&s;s, cough, belching of wind, a &s;en&s;e of heavine&s;s about the brea&s;t; and difficulty of breathing. To the&s;e &s;ucceed heat, fever, pain of the head, &s;ickne&s;s and nau&s;ea, great oppre&s;&s;ion of the brea&s;t, palpitation of the heart, a weak and &s;ometimes intermitting pul&s;e, an involuntary flow of tears, bilious vomitings, &amp;c. All the &s;ymptoms grow wor&s;e towards night; the patient is ea&s;ier when up than in bed, and is very de&s;irous of cool air.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;The food ought to be light, and of ea&s;y dige&s;tion. Boiled meats are generally preferred to roa&s;ted, and the fle&s;h of young animals to that of old. All windy food, and whatever is apt to &s;well upon the &s;tomach&punc; is to be avoided. Light puddings, white broths, and ripe fruits baked, boiled or roa&s;ted, are proper. Strong liquor of all kinds, e&s;pecially malt-liquor, is hurtful. The pati|ent &s;hould eat a very light &s;upper, or rather none at all. His cloathing &s;hould be warm, e&s;pecially in the winter-&s;ea&s;on. A flannel &s;hirt or wai&s;tcoat, and thick &s;hoes, are of great &s;ervice; as all di&s;orders of the brea&s;t are much re|lieved by keeping the feet warm, and promoting the per&s;pi|ration.</P>
<P>BUT nothing is of &s;o great importance in the a&s;thma as pure and moderately warm air. A&s;thmatic people can &s;el|dom bear either the clo&s;e heavy air of a large town, or the &s;harp, keen atmo&s;phere of a bleak hilly country; a medium between the&s;e is therefore to be cho&s;en. The air near a large town is often better than at a di&s;tance, provided the patient be removed &s;o far as not to be affected by the &s;moke. Some a&s;thmatic patients indeed breathe ea&s;ier in town than in the country; but this is &s;eldom the ca&s;e, e&s;pecially in towns where much coal is burnt. A&s;thmatic per&s;ons who are obliged to be in town all day, ought, at lea&s;t, to &s;leep out of it. Even this will often prove of great &s;ervice. Tho&s;e
<PB N="290" REF="012338_0294_0F88EA8C4AF9D468">
who can afford it ought to travel into a warmer climate. Many a&s;thmatic per&s;ons who cannot live in Britain enjoy very good health in the &s;outh of France, or in Spain or Italy.</P>
<P>EXERCISE is likewi&s;e of very great importance in the a&s;thma, as it promotes the dige&s;tion, and greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ts in the preparation of the blood. The blood of a&s;thmatic per|&s;ons is &s;eldom duly prepared, owing to the proper action of the lungs being impeded. For this rea&s;on &s;uch people ought daily to take as much exerci&s;e, either on foot, hor&s;e|back, or in a machine, as they can bear.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;Almo&s;t all that can be done by medicine in this di&s;ea&s;e, is to relieve the patient when &s;eiz|ed with a violent fit. This indeed requires the greate&s;t ex|pedition, as the di&s;ea&s;e often proves &s;uddenly fatal. In the paroxi&s;m or fit, the body is generally bound, a cly&s;ter ought therefore to be admini&s;tred, and if there be occa&s;ion, it may be repeated two or three times. The patient's feet ought to be put into warm water, and afterwards rubbed with a warm hand, or dry cloth. If there be a violent &s;pa&s;m about the brea&s;t or &s;tomach, warm fomentations, or bladders filled with warm milk and water, may be applied to the part affected, and warm catapla&s;ms to the &s;oles of the feet. The patient mu&s;t drink freely of diluting li|quors, and may take a tea-&s;poonful of the tincture of ca&s;tor and &s;affron, mixed together in a cup of valerian-tea, twice or thrice a-day. Sometimes a vomit has a very good effect, and &s;natches the patient, as it were, from the jaws of death. This will be more &s;afe after other evacuations have been premi&s;ed.</P>
<P>OUT OF THE FIT. In the moi&s;t a&s;thma, &s;uch things as promote expectoration or &s;pitting, ought to be u&s;ed; as the &s;yrup of &s;quills, gum-ammoniac, and &s;uch like. A common &s;poonful of the &s;yrup or oxomell of &s;quills, mixed with an equal quantity of cinnamon-water, may be taken three or four times a-day. Any quantity of gum-ammo|niac, with an equal quantity of a&s;afoetida, may be made into pills, and four or five of them taken every night at bed-time.</P>
<P>IN the convul&s;ive or nervous a&s;thma, anti&s;pa&s;modics and bracers are the mo&s;t proper medicines. The patient may take a tea-&s;poonful of the paregoric elixir twice a-day. The je&s;uits bark is likewi&s;e proper in this ca&s;e. It may be taken in &s;ub&s;tance, or infu&s;ed in wine. In &s;hort, every thing

<HEAD>OF THE APOPLEXY.</HEAD>
<P>THE apoplexy is a &s;udden lo&s;s of &s;en&s;e and motion, wherein the patient is to all appearance dead, only the heart and lungs &s;till continue to move. This di&s;ea&s;e, by a little care, might often be prevented, but can &s;eldom be cured. It chiefly attacks &s;edentary per&s;ons of a gro&s;s ha|bit, who u&s;e a rich and plentiful diet, and indulge in &s;trong liquors. People in the decline of life are mo&s;t &s;ubject to the apoplexy. It prevails mo&s;t in winter, e&s;pecially in long rainy &s;ea&s;ons, and very low &s;tates of the barometer.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;The immediate cau&s;e of an apoplexy is a compre&s;&s;ion of the brain, occa&s;ioned by an effu&s;ion of blood, or of watery humours on that part. The former is called a <HI>&s;anguine,</HI> and the latter a <HI>&s;erous apoplexy.</HI> It may be produced by any cau&s;e that increa&s;es the circulation to|wards the brain, or prevents the return of the blood from the head; as inten&s;e &s;tudy; violent pa&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I knew a woman who in a violent fit of anger was &s;eized with a &s;anguine apoplexy.

<P>SYMPTOMS, and method of cure.&mdash;The u&s;u|al forerunners of an apoplexy are giddine&s;s, pain, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;wimming of the head; lo&s;s of memory; drow&s;ine&s;s; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the ears; the night mare; a &s;pontaneous flux of tears, and laborious re&s;piration. When per&s;ons of an apoplectic make ob&s;erve the&s;e &s;ymptoms, they have rea&s;on to fear the approach of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it, and &s;hould endeavour to prevent it by plentiful bleeding, low diet, and opening medicines.</P>
<P>IN the &s;anguine apoplexy, if the patient does not die &s;uddenly, the countenance appears florid, the face is &s;well|ed or puffed up, and the blood-ve&s;&s;els, e&s;pecially about the neck and temples, are turged; the pul&s;e beats &s;trong; the eyes are prominent and fixed, and the breathing is difficult, and performed with a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orting noi&s;e. The excrements and urine are often voided &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and the patient is &s;ometimes &s;eized with a vomiting.</P>
<P>IN this ca&s;e every method mu&s;t be taken to le&s;&s;en the force of the blood towards the head. The patient &s;hould be kept perfectly ea&s;y and cool. His head &s;hould be rai&s;ed pret|ty high, and his feet &s;uffered to hang down. His cloaths ought to be loo&s;ened, e&s;pecially about the neck, and fre&s;h air admitted into his chamber. His garters &s;hould be tied pretty tight, by which means the motion of the blood from the lower extremities will be retarded. As &s;oon as the patient is placed in a proper po&s;ture, he &s;hould be bled pret|ty freely in the neck or arm, and, if there be occa&s;ion, the operation may be repeated in two or three hours. A laxa|tive cly&s;ter with plenty of &s;weet oil, or fre&s;h butter and a large &s;poonful of common &s;alt in it, may be admini&s;tred eve|ry two hours; and bli&s;tering pla&s;ters applied betwixt the &s;houlders, and to the calves of the legs.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the &s;ymptoms are a little abated, and the pa|tient is able to &s;wallow, he ought to drink freely of &s;ome di|luting opening liquor, as a decoction of tamarinds and li|quorice, cream-tartar-whey, or common whey with cream of tartar di&s;&s;olved in it. Or he may take any cooling purge, as Glauber's &s;alts, or manna di&s;&s;olved in an infu&s;ion of &s;enna, or the like. All &s;pirits and other &s;trong liquors are to be
<PB N="293" REF="012338_0297_0F88EA8EACBBBC88">
avoided. Even volatile &s;alts held to the no&s;e do mi&s;chief. Vomits, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, ought not be given, nor any thing that may increa&s;e the motion of the blood towards the head.</P>
<P>IN the &s;erous apoplexy, the &s;ymptoms are nearly &s;imilar, only the pul&s;e is not &s;o &s;trong, the countenance is le&s;s flo|rid, and the breathing le&s;s difficult. Bleeding is not &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary here, as in the former ca&s;e. It may however ge|nerally be performed once with &s;afety and advantage; but &s;hould not be repeated. The patient &s;hould be placed in the &s;ame po&s;ture as directed above, and &s;hould have bli&s;ter|ing pla&s;ters applied, and receive opening cly&s;ters in the &s;ame manner. Purges are here likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, and the pati|ent may drink &s;trong balm tea. If he be inclined to &s;weat, it ought to be promoted by drinking &s;mall wine whey, or an infu&s;ion of carduus benedictus. A plentiful &s;weat kept up for a con&s;iderable time, has often carried off a &s;erous a|poplexy.</P>
<P>WHEN apoplectic &s;ymptoms proceed from opium, or o|ther narcotic &s;ub&s;tances taken into the &s;tomach, vomits are nece&s;&s;ary. The patient is generally relieved, as &s;oon as he has di&s;charged the poi&s;on in this way.</P>
<P>PERSONS of an apoplectic make, or tho&s;e who have been attacked by it, ought to u&s;e a very &s;pare and &s;lender diet, a|voiding all &s;trong liquors, &s;piceries, and high &s;ea&s;oned food. They ought likewi&s;e to guard again&s;t all violent pa&s;&s;i|ons, and to avoid the extremes of heat and cold. The head &s;hould be &s;haved, and daily wa&s;hed with cold water. The feet ought to be kept warm, and never &s;uffered to con|tinue long wet. The belly mu&s;t, by all means, be kept open, either by food or medicine, and blood ought to be let every &s;pring and fall. Moderate exerci&s;e &s;hould likewi&s;e be taken; but it ought never to be continued too long. No|thing has a greater effect in preventing an apoplexy than i&s;|&s;ues or perpetual bli&s;ters; but great care mu&s;t be taken ne|ver to &s;uffer them to dry up, without opening others in their &s;tead. Apoplectic per&s;ons ought never to go to &s;leep with a full &s;tomach, nor to lie with their heads too low, or wear any thing tight about their necks.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE PALSY.</HEAD>
<P>THE pal&s;y is a lo&s;s or diminution of &s;en&s;e, or motion, or of both, in one or more parts of the body. It is more or le&s;s dangerous, according to the importance of the part af|fected. A pal&s;y of the heart, lungs, or any part nece&s;&s;ary for life, is mortal. When it affects the &s;tomach, the inte&s;|tines, or the bladder, it is highly dangerous. If the face be affected, the ca&s;e is bad, as this &s;hews, that the di&s;ea&s;e proceeds from the brain. If the part affected feels cold, is in&s;en&s;ible, or wa&s;tes away, there is &s;mall hopes of a cure, e&s;pecially, if the judgement and memory begin to fail.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;THE immediate cau&s;e of the pal&s;y is whatever prevents the regular exertion of the nervous pow|er upon any particular mu&s;cle or part of the body. The occa&s;ional and predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es are various, as drunkenne&s;s; wounds of the brain, or &s;pinal marrow; pre&s;&s;ure upon the brain or nerves; very cold or damp air; the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of cu&s;tomary evacuations; &s;udden fear; want of exerci&s;e; or or whatever greatly relaxes the &s;y&s;tem, as drinking much tea,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many people imagine, that tea has no tendency to hurt the nerves, and that drinking the &s;ame quantity of warm water would be equally pernicious. This however &s;eems to be a mi&s;take. I know many per|&s;ons who daily drink three or four cups of warm milk and water with|out feeling any bad con&s;equences; yet the &s;ame quantity of tea will make their hands &s;hake for twenty-four hours.</NOTE> or coffee, &amp;c. Wounds of the nerves them&s;elves, or any thing that ob&s;tructs the regular action of that vital pow|er contained in them, will occa&s;ion a pal&s;y. It may like|wi&s;e proceed from the poi&s;onous fumes of metals or minerals, as mercury, lead, ar&s;enick, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN young per&s;ons of a full habit, where there are &s;ymp|toms of inflammation, the pal&s;y mu&s;t be treated in the &s;ame manner as the &s;anguine apoplexy. The patient mu&s;t be bled, bli&s;tered, and have his belly kept open by &s;harp cly|&s;ters or pugative medicines. But, in old age, or when the di&s;ea&s;e proceeds from relaxation or debility, which is gene|rally the ca&s;e, a quite contrary cour&s;e mu&s;t be pur&s;ued. The diet mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> be warm and attenuating, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of &s;picy and aromatic vegetables, as mu&s;tard, hor&s;e-radi&s;h, &amp;c. The drink may be generous wine, mu&s;tard-whey, or brandy and water. Friction with the fle&s;h bru&s;h, or a warm hand, is extremely proper, e&s;pecially on the parts
<PB N="295" REF="012338_0299_0F88EDC6ED648F48">
affected. Bli&s;tering-pla&s;ters may likewi&s;e be applied to the affected parts with advantage. When this cannot be done, they may be rubbed with the volatile liniment, or the nerve-ointment of the Edinburgh di&s;pen&s;atory. But the be&s;t external application is electricity. The &s;hocks &s;hould be received on the part affected; and they ought daily to be repeated for &s;everal weeks. This is not only proper for curing, but al&s;o for preventing a pal&s;y.</P>
<P>VOMITS are very beneficial in this kind of pal&s;y, and ought to be frequently admini&s;tred. Caephalic &s;nuff, or any thing that makes the patient &s;neeze, is likewi&s;e u&s;eful. Some pretend to have found great benefit from rubbing the parts affected with nettles; but this does not &s;eem to be any ways preferable to bli&s;tering. If the tongue be affected, the patient may gargle his mouth frequently with brandy and mu&s;tard; or he may hold a bit of &s;ugar in his mouth wet with the pal&s;y-drops or compound &s;pirits of lavender. The wild valerian root is a very proper medicine in this ca&s;e. It may either be taken in an infu&s;ion with &s;age|leaves, or half a dram of it in powder may be given in a gla&s;s of wine three times a day. If the patient cannot u&s;e the valerian, he may take of <HI>&s;al volatile oleo&s;um,</HI> compound &s;pirits of lavender, and tincture of ca&s;tor, each half an ounce; mix the&s;e together, and take forty or fifty drops in a gla&s;s of wine, three or four times a day. A table &s;poon|ful of mu&s;tard-&s;eed taken frequently is a very good medi|cine. The patient ought likewi&s;e to chew cinnamon bark, ginger, or other warm &s;piceries.</P>
<P>EXERCISE is of the utmo&s;t importance in the pal&s;y; but the patient mu&s;t beware of cold, damp, and moi&s;t air. He ought to wear flannel next his &s;kin; and, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;hould remove into a warmer climate.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE EPILEPSY, OR FALLING SICKNESS.</HEAD>
<P>THE epilep&s;y is a &s;udden deprivation of all the &s;en&s;es, wherein the patient falls &s;uddenly down, and is affected with violent convul&s;ive motions. Children, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are delicately brought up, are mo&s;t &s;ubject to it. It more frequently attacks men than women, and is very diffi|cult to cure. When the epilep&s;y attacks children, there is rea&s;on to hope it may go off about the time of puberty.
<PB N="296" REF="012338_0300_0F88EDC7CF9B6068">
When it attacks any per&s;on after twenty years of age, the cure is difficult; but when after forty, a cure is hardly to be ex|pected. If the fit continues only for a &s;hort &s;pace, and re|turns &s;eldom, there is rea&s;on to hope; but if it continues long and returns frequently, the pro&s;pect is bad. It is a very unfavourable &s;ymptom, when the patient is &s;eized with the fits in his &s;leep.</P>
<P>CAUSES.&mdash;Sometimes the epilep&s;y is a hereditary di&s;ea&s;e. It may likewi&s;e proceed from a &s;udden fright of the mother when with child of the patient; from blows, brui&s;es, or wounds on the head; a collection of water, blood, or &s;erous humours in the brain; a polypus; tumours or concretions within the &s;kull; exce&s;&s;ive drinking; inten&s;e &s;tudy; exce&s;s of venery; worms; teething; &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of cu&s;tomary evacuations; too great emptine&s;s or repletion; violent pa&s;&s;ions or affections of the mind, as fear, joy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> hy&s;teric affections; contagion received into the body, as the infection of the &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;An epileptic fit is generally pre|ceded by an unu&s;ual wearine&s;s; pain of the head; dulne&s;s; giddine&s;s; noi&s;e in the ears; dimne&s;s of &s;ight; palpitation of the heart; di&s;turbed &s;leep; difficult breathing; the bow|els are inflated with wind; the urine is in great quantity, but thin; the complexion is pale; the extremities are cold, and the patient feels as it were a &s;tream of cold air a&s;cend|ing towards his head.</P>
<P>IN the fit, the patient generally makes an unu&s;ual noi&s;e; his thumbs are drawn in towards the palms of the hands; his eyes are di&s;torted; he &s;tarts, and foams at the mouth; his extremities are bent or twi&s;ted various ways; he often di&s;charges his &s;eed, urine, and foeces involuntarily; and is quite de&s;titute of all &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on. After the fit is over, his &s;en&s;es gradually return, and he complains of a kind of &s;tupor, wearine&s;s, and pain of his head; but has no remem|brance of what happened to him during the fit.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the fits return at &s;tated periods, as at the full or change of the moon: at other times they are excited by violent affections of the mind, a debauch of liquor, ex|ce&s;&s;ive heat, cold, or the like.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e, from the difficulty of inve&s;tigating its cau&s;es, and its &s;trange &s;ymptoms, was formerly attributed to the wrath of the gods, or the agency of evil &s;pirits. In modern times it has often, by the vulgar, been imputed to
<PB N="297" REF="012338_0301_0F88EDC971359860">
witchcraft or fa&s;cination. It depends however as much up|on natural cau&s;es as any other malady; and its cure can only be effected by per&s;i&s;ting in the u&s;e of proper means.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;Epileptic patients ought, if po&s;&s;ible, to breathe a pure and free air. Their diet &s;hould be nouri&s;h|ing, but of ea&s;y dige&s;tion. They ought to drink nothing &s;trong, to avoid &s;wines fle&s;h, water-fowl, and likewi&s;e all windy and oily vegetables, as cabbage, nuts, &amp;c. They ought to keep them&s;elves cheerful, carefully avoiding all occa&s;ions of violent pa&s;&s;ions, as anger, fear, &amp;c<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has already been ob&s;erved that epileptic &s;its are often the effect of fear, and are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by that idle cu&s;tom among young people of frightening one another. Though this be generally done out of mere frolic, it has many dreadful con&s;equences, and ought by all means to be di&s;couraged. It is finely a &s;maller crime to take away a per&s;on's life, than to render him at once mi&s;erable in him&s;elf, and a burden to &s;ociety.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EXERCISE is likewi&s;e of great u&s;e; but the patient mu&s;t be careful to avoid all extremes either of heat or cold, all dangerous &s;ituations, as &s;tanding upon precipices, riding deep waters, &amp;c. Any thing that makes him giddy, is apt to occa&s;ion a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it, as turning round, looking into a deep pit, or the like; all the&s;e ought therefore to be avoided with the utmo&s;t care.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;The intentions of cure mu&s;t vary according to the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e. If the patient be of a &s;anguine temperament, and there be rea&s;on to fear an inflammation in the brain, bleeding and other evacuations will be nece&s;&s;ary. When the di&s;ea&s;e is occa&s;ioned by the &s;toppage of cu&s;tomary evacuations, the&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, mu&s;t be re&s;tored; if this cannot be done, others may be &s;ub&s;ti|tuted in their place. I&s;&s;ues or &s;etons, in this ca&s;e, have often a very good effect. When there is rea&s;on to believe that the di&s;ea&s;e proceeds from worms, proper medicines mu&s;t be u&s;ed to kill or carry off the&s;e vermin. When the di&s;ea&s;e proceeds from teething, the belly &s;hould be kept open by emollient cly&s;ters, the feet frequently bathed in warm wa|ter, and, if the fits prove ob&s;tinate, a bli&s;tering pla&s;ter may be put betwixt the &s;houlders. The &s;ame method is to be followed, when epileptic fits precede the eruption of the &s;mall-pox, or mea&s;les, &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHEN the di&s;ea&s;e is hereditary, or proceeds from a wrong formation of the brain a cure is not to be expected. When it is owing to &s;ome fault in the nervous &s;y&s;tem &s;uch
<PB N="298" REF="012338_0302_0F88EDCA0334DCA0">
medicines as tend to brace and &s;trengthen the nerves may be u&s;ed, as the Je&s;uits bark, Valerian root, mi&s;letoe of the oak, &s;nake-root, &amp;c.</P>
<P>FULLER recommends the following electuary as a mo&s;t excellent <HI>anti-epileptic.</HI> Take Je&s;uits bark in powder three ounces, Virginian &s;nake-root powdered one ounce, as much &s;yrup of paeony or cloves as is &s;ufficient to form it in|to a &s;oft electuary. The do&s;e to an adult is a dram, or a|bout the &s;ize of a nutmeg, morning and evening. It mu&s;t be continued for three or four months, and after|wards repeated, three or four days before the new and full moon, for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>MEAD recommends an electuary again&s;t the epilep&s;y much of the &s;ame nature, only he u&s;es Valerian-root in place of the &s;nake-root. It mu&s;t be taken in the &s;ame manner as the above. The patient ought always to be bled, and to take a purge or two before he begins to u&s;e the&s;e medicines. They will likewi&s;e have a better effect if the patient drinks a tea-cupful of the decoction of <HI>guaiacum</HI> after each do&s;e. It may be made by boiling two ounces of guaiacum &s;havings, and one ounce of rai&s;ins of the &s;un &s;toned, in two Engli&s;h quarts of water to one. Strain the liquor, and afterwards let it &s;tand to &s;ettle, then pour off the clear from the feces.</P>
<P>COLEBATCH &s;ays, that the mi&s;letoe cures an epilep&s;y as certainly as the Je&s;uits bark does an intermittent fever. The do&s;e to an adult is half a dram of the powder, four times a-day, drinking after it a draught of a &s;trong infu&s;ion of the &s;ame plant. Though this medicine has not been found to an&s;wer the high encomiums which have been pa&s;&s;ed upon it, yet in ob&s;tinate epileptic ca&s;es it de&s;erves a trial. It mu&s;t be u&s;ed for a con&s;iderable time, in order to produce any &s;a|lutary effects.</P>
<P>MUSK has &s;ometimes been found to an&s;wer very well in the epilep&s;y. Ten or twelve grains of it, with the &s;ame quantity of factitious cinnabar, may be made up into a bo|lus and taken every night and morning.</P>

<P>CONVULSION FITS proceed from the &s;ame cau&s;es, and mu&s;t be treated in the &s;ame manner as the epilep&s;y.</P>
<P>THERE is one particular &s;pecies of convul&s;ions, which commonly goes by the name of St. Vitus's dance, wherein the patient is agitated with &s;trange motions and ge&s;ticulati|ons, which by the common people are generally believed

to be the effects of witchcraft. This di&s;ea&s;e may be cured by repeated bleedings and purges; and afterwards u&s;ing the medicines pre&s;cribed above for the epilep&s;y, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the je&s;uits-bark, and &s;nake-root, &amp;c.

<P>OF ALL di&s;ea&s;es incident to mankind, tho&s;e of the ner|vous kind are the mo&s;t complicated and difficult to cure. A volume would not be &s;ufficient to point out the various &s;ymptoms.

Like Proteus, they are continual|ly changing &s;hape; and upon every fre&s;h attack, the pati|ent thinks he feels &s;ymptoms which he never experienced before. Nor do they only effect the body, the mind like|wi&s;e &s;uffers, and is often thereby rendered extremely weak and peevi&s;h. The low &s;pirits, timorou&s;ne&s;s, melancho|ly, and ficklene&s;s of temper which generally attend ner|vous di&s;orders, induce many people to believe, that they are entirely di&s;ea&s;es of the mind; but this change of temper is rather a con&s;equence, than the cau&s;e of nervous di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

<P>NERVOUS di&s;orders often proceed from affections of the mind, as grief, di&s;appointments, anxiety, inten&s;e &s;tudy, &amp;c. Few &s;tudious per&s;ons are free from nervous di&s;ea&s;es. Nor is this at all to be wondered at; inten&s;e thinking not only preys upon the &s;pirits, but prevents the per&s;on from taking proper exerci&s;e, by which means the dige&s;tion i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">-im|paired, the nouri&s;hment prevented, the &s;olids relaxed, and the whole ma&s;s of humours vitiated. Grief and di&s;appoint|ment
<PB N="300" REF="012338_0304_0F88EDD06BD32D60">
likewi&s;e produce the &s;ame effects. I have known more hy&s;teric and hypochondriac patients, who dated the commencement of their di&s;orders from the lo&s;s of a hu&s;band, a favourite child, or from &s;ome di&s;appointment in life, than from any other cau&s;e. In a word, whatever weakens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he body, or depre&s;&s;es the &s;pirits, may occa&s;ion nervous di&s;|orders, as unwhole&s;ome air, want of &s;leep, great fatigue, &amp;c.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;We &s;hall only mention &s;ome of the mo&s;t general &s;ymptoms of the&s;e di&s;orders, as it would be both an u&s;ele&s;s and impracticable ta&s;k to point out the whole. They generally begin with windy inflations or di|&s;ten&s;ions of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, e&s;pecially under the fal&s;e ribs of the left &s;ide, where a hard tumour may &s;ome|times be perceived. The appetite and dige&s;tion are general|ly bad; yet &s;ometimes there is an uncommon craving for food, and a quick dige&s;tion. The food often turns &s;our on the &s;tomach; and the patient is troubled with vomiting of clear water, tough phlegm, or a blacki&s;h coloured liquor re&s;embling the grounds of coffee. Excruciating pains are often felt about the navel, attended with a rumbling or murmuring noi&s;e in the bowels. The belly is &s;ometimes loo&s;e, but more commonly bound, which occa&s;ions a reten|tion of wind and great unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE urine is &s;ometimes in &s;mall quantity, at other times very copious and quite clear. There is a great &s;traitne&s;s of the brea&s;t with difficulty of breathing; violent palpitations of the heart; &s;udden flu&s;hings of heat in various parts of the body; at other times a &s;en&s;e of cold, as if water were pour|ed on them; flying pains in the arms and limbs; pains in the back and belly, re&s;embling tho&s;e occa&s;ioned by gravel; the pul&s;e very variable, &s;ometimes uncommonly &s;low, and at other times very quick; yawning, the hiccup, frequent &s;ighings and a &s;en&s;e of &s;uffocation, as if from a ball or lump in the throat; alternate fits of crying and convul&s;ive laugh|ing; the &s;leep is un&s;ound, and &s;eldom refre&s;hing; and the patient is often troubled with the night-mare.</P>
<P>AS the di&s;ea&s;e increa&s;es, the patient is mole&s;ted with headachs, cramps, and fixt pains in various parts of the body; the eyes are clouded, and often affected with pain and dryne&s;s; there is a noi&s;e in the ears, and often a dull|ne&s;s of hearing; in &s;hort, the whole animal functions are impaired. The mind is di&s;turbed on the mo&s;t trivial occa|&s;ions,
<PB N="301" REF="012338_0305_0F88EDD0C22CC340">
and is hurried into the mo&s;t perver&s;e commotions, in|quietudes, terror, &s;adne&s;s, anger, diffidence, &amp;c. The pa|tient is apt to entertain wild imaginations, and extravagant fancies; the memory becomes weak, and the rea&s;on fails. Nothing is more characteri&s;tic of this di&s;ea&s;e than a con&s;tant dread of death. This renders the patients peevi&s;h, fickle, impatient, and apt to run from one phy&s;ician to another; which is one rea&s;on why they &s;eldom reap any benefit from medicine, as they have not &s;ufficient re&s;olution to per&s;i&s;t in any one cour&s;e till it has time to produce its proper effects. They are likewi&s;e apt to imagine that they labour under di&s;|ea&s;es from which they are quite free, and are very angry if any one attempts to laugh them out of their ridiculous no|tions.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;Hy&s;teric and hypochondriac per|&s;ons ought never to fa&s;t long. Their food &s;hould be &s;olid and nouri&s;hing, but of ea&s;y dige&s;tion. Fat meats, and heavy &s;auces, are hurtful. All exce&s;s &s;hould be carefully avoided. They ought never to eat more at a time than they can ea&s;ily dige&s;t. Heavy &s;uppers are to be avoided. If the patient feels him&s;elf weak and faint between meals, he ought to eat a bit of bread, and drink a gla&s;s of wine. Tho' wine in exce&s;s enfeebles the body, and impairs the faculties of the mind, yet taken in moderation, it &s;trengthens the &s;tomach, and promotes dige&s;tion. Wine and water is a very proper drink at meals. If wine &s;ours on the &s;tomach, or the patient is much troubled with wind, brandy and wa|ter will an&s;wer better. Every thing that is windy, or hard of dige&s;tion, mu&s;t be avoided. All weak and warm liquors are hurtful, as tea, coffee, punch, &amp;c. People may find a temporary relief from the&s;e, but they always increa&s;e the malady, as they weaken the &s;tomach, and hurt dige&s;tion. Above all things, drams are to be avoided. Whatever im|mediate ea&s;e the patient may feel from the u&s;e of ardent &s;pi|rits, they are &s;ure to aggravate the malady, and prove cer|tain poi&s;ons at la&s;t. The&s;e cautions are the more nece&s;&s;a|ry here, as all hy&s;teric and hypochondriac per&s;ons are pe|culiarly fond of tea and ardent &s;pirits; to the u&s;e of which many of them fall a victim.</P>
<P>EXERCISE is of &s;uch importance in nervous di&s;orders, that it is worth all other medicines. Riding on hor&s;eback is generally e&s;teemed the be&s;t, as it gives motion to the whole body, without fatiguing it. I have known &s;ome patients,


<PB N="302" REF="012338_0306_0F88EDD183B979D8">
however, with whom walking agreed better, and others who were mo&s;t benefited by riding in a machine. Every one ought to u&s;e that which he finds mo&s;t beneficial. Long &s;ea-voyages have an excellent effect; and to tho&s;e who can afford to take them, and have &s;ufficient re&s;olution, we would by all means recommend this cour&s;e. Even change of place, and the &s;ight of new objects, by diverting the mind, have a great tendency to remove the&s;e complaints. For this rea&s;on a long journey, or a voyage, is of much more advantage than riding &s;hort journeys near home.</P>
<P>A cool and dry air is the be&s;t, as it braces and imparts vigour to the whole body. Nothing tends more to relax and enervate than hot air, e&s;pecially that which is render|ed &s;o by great fires, or &s;toves in &s;mall apartments. But when the &s;tomach or bowels are weak, the body ought to be well guarded again&s;t cold, e&s;pecially in winter, by wear|ing a thin flannel wai&s;tcoat next the &s;kin. This will keep up an equal per&s;piration, and defend the alimentary canal from many impre&s;&s;ions, to which it would otherwi&s;e be &s;ubject, upon every &s;udden change from warm to cold wea|ther. Rubbing the body frequently with a fle&s;h-bru&s;h, or a coar&s;e linen cloth, is likewi&s;e beneficial, as it promotes the circulation, per&s;piration, &amp;c. Per&s;ons who have weak nerves ought to ri&s;e early, and take exerci&s;e before break|fa&s;t, as lying too long a-bed cannot fail to relax the &s;olids. They ought likewi&s;e to be diverted, and to be kept as ea&s;y and cheerful as po&s;&s;ible. Nothing hurts the nervous &s;y&s;tem, or weakens the dige&s;tive powers more than fear, grief, or anx|iety.</P>
<P>MEDICINES.&mdash;Tho' nervous di&s;ea&s;es are &s;el|dom radically cured, yet their &s;ymptoms may &s;ometimes be alleviated, and the patient's life rendered, at lea&s;t, more comfortable, by proper medicines.</P>
<P>WHEN the patient is co&s;tive, he ought to take a little rhubarb, or &s;ome other mild purgative, and &s;hould never &s;uffer his belly to be long bound. All &s;trong and violent purga|tives are however to be avoided, as aloes, jalap, &amp;c. I have generally &s;een an infu&s;ion of &s;enna and rhubarb in brandy an&s;wer very well. This may be made of any &s;trength, and taken in &s;uch quantity as the patient finds nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>WHEN the dige&s;tion is bad, and the &s;tomach relaxed and weak, bitters will be of &s;ervice. The be&s;t of the&s;e are the je&s;uits bark and gentian root, which may be prepared and
<PB N="303" REF="012338_0307_0F88EDD22F2E04A8">
u&s;ed in the following manner. Take je&s;uits bark in pow|der, an ounce and a half, gentian-root and orange peel brui&s;ed, of each half an ounce. Infu&s;e the&s;e ingredients in a bottle of brandy or whi&s;ky, for five or &s;ix days, then &s;train the liquor, and take a table &s;poonful in half a gla&s;s of water an hour before breakfa&s;t, dinner, and &s;upper.</P>
<P>NOTHING tends more to &s;trengthen the nervous &s;y&s;tem than cold bathing. This practice, if duly per&s;i&s;ted in, will produce very extraordinary effects; but when the liver or other <HI>vi&s;cera</HI> are ob&s;tructed, or otherwi&s;e un&s;ound, the cold bath is improper. The mo&s;t proper &s;ea&s;ons for it are &s;ummer and autumn. It will be &s;ufficient, e&s;pecially for per&s;ons of a &s;pare habit, to go into the cold bath three or four times a week. If the patient be weakened by it, or feels chilly for a long time after coming out, it is improper.</P>
<P>IN patients afflicted with wind, I have always ob&s;erved the greate&s;t benefit from the acid elixir of vitriol. It may be taken in the quantity of fifteen, twenty, or thirty drops, twice or thrice a-day, in a gla&s;s of water. This both ex|pels wind, &s;trengthens the &s;tomach, and promotes dige&s;ti|on.</P>
<P>OPIATES are greatly extolled in the&s;e maladies; but as they only palliate the &s;ymptoms, and generally afterwards increa&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e, we would advi&s;e people to be extreme|ly cautious in the u&s;e of them, le&s;t habit render them at la&s;t ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IT would be an ea&s;y matter to enumerate many medicines which have been extolled for relieving nervous di&s;orders; but whoever wi&s;hes for a thorough cure mu&s;t expect it from regimen alone; we &s;hall therefore omit mentioning more medicines, and again recommend the &s;tricte&s;t attention to DIET, AIR, EXERCISE, and AMUSEMENTS.</P>

<HEAD>OF MELANCHOLY AND MADNESS.</HEAD>
<P>MELANCHOLY and madne&s;s are nearly allied. They both proceed from the &s;ame origin, and may be con&s;idered as only different degrees of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e. <HI>A delirium without a fever</HI> is the common definition of madne&s;s: Indeed it is not a very accurate one; but there is no great occa&s;i|on to be &s;olicitous about the definition of a di&s;ea&s;e which every body knows. It is of far greater importance to know how it is occa&s;ioned, and by what means it may be cured.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="012338_0308_0F88EDD2F594FEC8">
CAUSES.&mdash;It may proceed from a hereditary di&s;|po&s;ition; inten&s;e thinking, e&s;pecially where the mind is long occupied about one object; violent pa&s;&s;ions or affecti|ons of the mind, as love, fear, joy, grief, over-weening pride, and &s;uch like. It may al&s;o be occa&s;ioned by exce&s;|&s;ive venery; narcotic or &s;tupifactive poi&s;ons; a &s;edentary life; &s;olitude; the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of cu&s;tomary evacuations; accute fevers, or other di&s;ea&s;es. Violent anger will change melancholy into madne&s;s; and exce&s;&s;ive cold, e&s;pecially of the lower extremities, will force the blood in|to the brain, and produce all the &s;ymptoms of madne&s;s. It may likewi&s;e proceed from the u&s;e of aliment that is hard of dige&s;tion, or which cannot be ea&s;ily a&s;&s;imilated; from a callous &s;tate of the integuments of the brain, or a dryne&s;s of the brain it&s;elf. To all which we may add gloomy or mi&s;taken notions of religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE mind by dwelling too long upon the dark &s;ide of religion, is often, at length, overwhelmed with the deepe&s;t melancholy, which ends in madne&s;s. What a pity that <HI>religion,</HI> which was intended to al|leviate the calamities of life, to keep the mind cheerful, and to rai&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> above di&s;appointment, &s;hould ever be perverted into the means of producing the&s;e very evils it was de&s;igned to cure?</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;When per&s;ons begin to be me|lancholy, they are dull; dejected; timorous; watchful; fond of &s;olitude; fretful; fickle; captious and inqui&s;itive; &s;olicitous about trifles; &s;ometimes niggardly, and at other times prodigal. The belly is generally bound; the urine thin, and in &s;mall quantity; the &s;tomach and bowels in|flated with wind; the complexion pale; the pul&s;e &s;low and weak. The functions of the mind are al&s;o greatly pervert|ed, in &s;o much that the patient often imagines him&s;elf dead, or changed into &s;ome other animal. Some have ima|gined, their bodies were made of gla&s;s, or other brittle &s;ub|&s;tances, and were afraid to move le&s;t they &s;hould be broken in pieces. The unhappy patient, in this ca&s;e, unle&s;s care|fully watched, is apt to put an end to his own mi&s;erable life.</P>
<P>THE &s;igns of approaching madne&s;s are: Redne&s;s of the eyes, with a tremulous and con&s;tant vibration of the eye|lids; a change of di&s;po&s;ition and behaviour; &s;upercilious looks; a haughty carriage; grinding of the teeth; unac|countable malice to particular per&s;ons; exce&s;&s;ive watchful|ne&s;s, violent headachs; quickne&s;s of hearing; noi&s;e in the ears, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="012338_0309_0F88EDD3B4948688">
PERSONS actually mad are in an exce&s;&s;ive rage when pro|voked to anger. Some wander about, others make a hide|ous noi&s;e. Some &s;hun the &s;ight of men; others, if permit|ted, would tear them&s;elves, or tho&s;e whom they meet, to pieces. Some in the highe&s;t degree of the di&s;order &s;ee ima|ges before their eyes, and fancy them&s;elves &s;truck with lightening. To the&s;e we may add incredible &s;trength, and great in&s;en&s;ibility to hunger and cold.</P>
<P>WHEN the di&s;ea&s;e is owing to an ob&s;truction of cu&s;tom|ary evacuations, or any bodily di&s;order, it is ea&s;ier cured than when it proceeds from the mind. Madne&s;s attended with mirth is not &s;o dangerous as that which is accompani|ed with &s;adne&s;s. A di&s;charge of blood from the no&s;e, a vi|olent loo&s;ene&s;s, &s;cabby eruptions, the bleeding piles, or the <HI>men&s;es,</HI> &s;ometimes carry off this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>DISEASES of the mind often intermit for &s;everal years, and return again. In &s;ome they return annually at the &s;ol|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ics; in others about the time of the equinoxes. Some|times the raving fits ob&s;erve the lunar periods; in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e is thought to have &s;ome affinity with the e|pilep&s;y.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;The diet ought to con&s;i&s;t chiefly of vegetables of a cooling and opening quality. Animal food, e&s;pecially &s;alted or &s;moke-dried fi&s;h or fle&s;h, ought to be avoided. All kinds of &s;hell-fi&s;h are bad. Aliments pre|pared with onions, garlic, or any thing that generates thick blood, are likewi&s;e improper. All kinds of fruits that are whole&s;ome may be eat with advantage. Boerhaave gives an in&s;tance of a patient who by a long u&s;e of whey, water, and garden-fruits, evacuated a great quantity of black matter, and recovered his &s;en&s;es. This &s;eems to have been the method of cure practiced at the A&s;&s;yrian court; where we find the monarch him&s;elf, when &s;eized with mad|ne&s;s, was turned out to graze.</P>
<P>STRONG liquors of every kind ought to be avoided as poi&s;on. The mo&s;t proper drink is water, whey, or very &s;mall beer. Tea and coffee are improper. If honey agrees with the patient, it may be eat freely, or his drink &s;weet|ened with it. Infu&s;ions of balm-leaves, penny-royal, the roots of wild valerian, or the flowers of the lime-tree, may be drank freely, either by them&s;elves, or &s;weetened with honey, as the patient &s;hall chu&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="012338_0310_0F88EDD4F1C9CDC8">
THE patient ought to take as much exerci&s;e in the open air as he can bear. This helps to di&s;&s;olve the vi&s;cid humours, it removes ob&s;tructions, promotes the per&s;piration, and all the other &s;ecretions. Every kind of madne&s;s is attended with a dimini&s;hed per&s;piration; all means ought therefore to be u&s;ed to promote that nece&s;&s;ary and &s;alutary di&s;charge. Nothing can have a more direct tendency to increa&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e than the common method of confining the patient to a clo&s;e apartment. Were a proper &s;pace allotted for him to run about in, where he could neither hurt him&s;elf nor others, it would contribute much to promote a cure. It would have &s;till a better effect, if he were obliged to labour a piece of ground. By <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, hoeing, planting, &s;ow|ing, &amp;c. both the body and mind would be exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>A PLAN of this kind, with a &s;trict vegetable diet, would be a more rational method of cure than confining the patient in Bedlam, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ending him to a private mad-hou&s;e. The&s;e in&s;titutions, as they are generally managed, are far more likely to make a wi&s;e man mad than to re&s;tore a madman to his &s;en&s;es. Even running about at large, tho' it may be attended with &s;ome bad con&s;equences, is more likely to re|&s;tore the patient than confining him in a mad-hou&s;e. I have known &s;everal in&s;tances of per&s;ons cured by exerci&s;e, amu&s;ements, and a vegetable diet, who, in all probability, had they been confined, would have continued lunatic for life. A long journey, or a voyage, e&s;pecially into a warm|er climate, with agreeable companions, has often very hap|py effects.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;IN the cure of madne&s;s, great re|gard mu&s;t be paid to the mind. When the patient is in a low melancholy &s;tate, his mind ought to be &s;oothed and di|verted with variety of amu&s;ements, as entertaining &s;tories, pa&s;times, mu&s;ic, &amp;c. This &s;eems to have been the method of curing melancholy among the Jews, as we learn from the &s;tory of King Saul; and indeed it is a very rational one. Nothing can remove di&s;ea&s;es of the mind &s;o effectually as applications to the mind it&s;elf, the mo&s;t efficacious of which is mu&s;ic. The patient's company ought likewi&s;e to con|&s;i&s;t of &s;uch per&s;ons as are agreeable to him. People in this &s;tate are apt to conceive unaccountable aver&s;ions again&s;t particular per&s;ons; and the very &s;ight of &s;uch per&s;ons is &s;ufficient to di&s;tract their minds, and throw them into the
<PB N="307" REF="012338_0311_0F88EDD692826B28">
utmo&s;t perturbation. In all kinds of madne&s;s, it is better to &s;ooth and calm the mind than to ruffle it by contradicti|on.</P>
<P>WHEN the patient is high, evacuations are nece&s;&s;ary. In this ca&s;e he mu&s;t be bled, and have his belly kept open by purging medicines, as manna, rhubarb, cream of tartar, or the &s;olube tartar. I have &s;een the la&s;t have very good ef|fects. It may be taken in the do&s;e of half an ounce, di&s;|&s;olved, in water gruel every day, for &s;undry weeks, or even for months, if nece&s;&s;ary. More or le&s;s may be given according as it operates. Vomits have likewi&s;e a good ef|fect; but they mu&s;t be pretty &s;trong, otherwi&s;e they will not operate.</P>
<P>MADNESS has &s;ometimes been cured by camphire. Ten or twelve grains of it may be rubbed in a mortar with half a dram of nitre, and taken twice a day, or oftner if the &s;tomach will bear it. If it will not &s;it upon the &s;tomach in this form, it may be made into pills with gum a&s;afaetida and Ru&s;&s;ian ca&s;tor, and taken in the quantity above direct|ed. Mu&s;k has likewi&s;e been found efficacious in this ca&s;e; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to have any effect, it mu&s;t be given in large do&s;es. A &s;cruple or twenty five grains may be made into a bolus with a little honey or &s;yrup, and taken twice or thrice a day. The antimonial wine is by &s;ome extolled for the cure of madne&s;s. It may be taken in the do&s;e of forty or fifty drops, twice or thrice a day, in a cup of tea. The tincture of hellebore h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s likewi&s;e been in great e&s;teem; but I never &s;aw any con|&s;iderable effects from it. Each of the above medicines may be of &s;ervice in &s;ome particular ca&s;e, provided it be duly per&s;i&s;ted in, and where one fails, it may not be ami&s;s to try another.</P>
<P>AS it is very difficult to induce patients in this di&s;ea&s;e to take medicines, we &s;hall mention &s;ome outward appli|cations which &s;ometimes do good; the principal of the&s;e are i&s;&s;ues, &s;etons, and cold bathing. I&s;&s;ues may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in any part of the body, but they generally have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ef|fect near the &s;pine of the back. The di&s;charge from the&s;e may be greatly promoted by dre&s;&s;ing them with the mild bli&s;tering ointment, and keeping what are commonly called the orrice peas in them. The &s;alt water is mo&s;t proper for bathing in; but when that cannot be obtained, the patient may be daily immer&s;ed in fre&s;h water. Some
<PB N="308" REF="012338_0312_0F88EDD6AB270EE0">
recommend bathing the body in warm water, and at the &s;ame time pouring cold water upon the head.</P>
<P>THAT kind of madne&s;s or delirium which proceeds from mere weakne&s;s, requires a quite different method of treat|ment. It is often the effect of fevers injudiciou&s;ly treated, wherein the patient's &s;trength has been exhau&s;ted by frequent bleedings and purgings. This mu&s;t be removed by nouri&s;h|ing diet, exerci&s;e proportioned to the patient's &s;trength, and cordial medicines. All evacuations are here carefully to be avoided. The patient may take frequently a gla&s;s of good wine, in which a little je&s;uits bark has been infu&s;ed.</P>

<P>EVERY per&s;on ought, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to be acquaint|ed with the nature and cure of poi&s;ons. They are general|ly taken unawares, and their effects are often &s;o &s;udden and violent, as not to admit of delay, or allow time to procure the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of phy&s;icians.

<P>THE vulgar notion that every poi&s;on is cured by &s;ome counter poi&s;on, as a &s;pecific, has done much hurt. People believe they can do nothing for the patient, unle&s;s they know the particular antidote to that kind of poi&s;on which he has taken.

<P>THERE is no ca&s;e wherein nature points out the method of cure more clearly than in this. Poi&s;on is &s;eldom long in the &s;tomach before it occa&s;ions &s;ickne&s;s with an inclination to vomit. This &s;hews plainly what ought to be done. In|deed common &s;en&s;e dictates to every man, that, if any thing has been taken into the &s;tomach which endangers life, it ought immediately to be di&s;charged. Were this duly re|garded, mo&s;t of the mi&s;chief occa&s;ioned by poi&s;on might be prevented. The method of cure is obvious, and the means of performing it are in the hands of every man.</P>
<P>POISONS, either belong to the animal, vegetable, or mi|neral kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="012338_0313_0F88EDDAC91B5C20">
MINERAL poi&s;ons are commonly of an acrid or corro&s;ive quality, as ar&s;enic, the corro&s;ive &s;ublimate of mercury, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THOSE of the vegetable kind are generally of a narcotic or &s;tupifactive quality, as poppy, hemlock, henbane, ber|ries of the deadly night-&s;hade, &amp;c.</P>
<P>POISONOUS animals communicate their infection, either by the bite or &s;ting. This poi&s;on is very different from the former, both in its &s;ymptoms and cure.</P>
<P>MINERAL POISONS.&mdash;Ar&s;enic is the mo&s;t common of this cla&s;s; and, as the whole of them are pret|ty &s;imilar both in their effects and method of cure, what is &s;aid with re&s;pect to it will be applicable to every other &s;pe|cies of corro&s;ive poi&s;on.</P>
<P>WHEN a per&s;on has taken ar&s;enic, he &s;oon percieves a burning heat, and violent pricking pain in his &s;tomach and bowels, with vomiting and intolerable thir&s;t. The tongue and throat feel rough and dry; and, if proper help be not &s;oon admini&s;tred, the patient is &s;eized with great anxiety, hiccupping, faintings, and coldne&s;s of the extremeties. To the&s;e &s;ucceed black vomits, foetid &s;tools, with a mortifica|tion of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, which are the immedi|ate forerunners of death.</P>
<P>ON the fir&s;t appearance of the&s;e &s;ymptoms, the patient &s;hould drink large quantities of new milk and &s;alad oil till he vomits; or he may drink warm water mixed with oil. Fat broths are al&s;o proper, provided they can be got ready in time. Where no oil is to be had, fre&s;h butter may be melted and mixed with the milk or water. The&s;e things are to be drank as long as the inclination to vomit conti|nues. Some have drank eight or ten Engli&s;h quarts before the vomiting cea&s;ed; and it is never &s;afe to leave off drink|ing while one particle of the poi&s;on remains in the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>THESE oily or fat &s;ub&s;tances not only provoke vomiting, but likewi&s;e blunt the acrimony of the poi&s;on, and prevent its wounding the bowels; but if they &s;hould not make the per&s;on vomit, half a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or two &s;cruples of the powder of ipecacoanha mu&s;t be given, or a few &s;poonfuls of the oxy|mel of &s;quills mixed with the water which he drinks. Vo|miting may likewi&s;e be excited by tickling the in&s;ide of the throat with a feather.</P>
<P>IF the tormenting pains are felt in the lower belly, and there is rea&s;on to fear, that the inte&s;tines are attacked, cly&s;|ters of milk and oil mu&s;t be very frequently thrown up;
<PB N="310" REF="012338_0314_0F88EDDC62066F18">
and the patient mu&s;t drink emollient decoctions of bar|ley, oatmeal, mar&s;hmallows, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>AFTER the poi&s;on has been evacuated, the patient ought, for &s;ome time, to live upon &s;uch things as are of a healing and cooling quality. To ab&s;tain from fle&s;h and all &s;trong liquors, and to live upon milk, broth, gruel, light pud|dings, and other &s;poon mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s of ea&s;y dige&s;tion. His drink &s;hould be barley-water, lin&s;eed-tea, or infu&s;ions of any of the mild mucilaginous vegetables.</P>
<P>VEGETABLE POISONS, be&s;ides heat and pain of the &s;tomach, commonly occa&s;ion &s;ome degree of giddine&s;s, and often a kind of &s;tupidity or folly. Per&s;ons who have taken the&s;e mu&s;t be treated in the &s;ame manner as for the mineral or corro&s;ive.</P>
<P>THOUGH the vegetable poi&s;ons, when allowed to remain in the &s;tomach, often prove fatal; yet the danger is gene|rally over as &s;oon as they are di&s;charged. Not being of &s;uch a cau&s;tic or corro&s;ive nature, they are le&s;s apt to wound and inflame the bowels than mineral &s;ub&s;tances, no time however ought to be lo&s;t in having them expelled the &s;to|mach.</P>
<P>OPIUM, being frequently taken by mi&s;take, merits par|ticular attention. It is u&s;ed as a medicine both in a &s;olid and liquid form, which latter commonly goes by the name of laudanum. It is indeed a valuable medicine when taken in proper quantity; but as an over-do&s;e proves a &s;trong poi&s;on, we &s;hall point out its common effects, to|gether with the method of cure.</P>
<P>TOO great a quantity of opium generally occa&s;ions great drow&s;ine&s;s, with &s;tupor and other apoplectic &s;ymptoms. Sometimes the per&s;on has &s;o great an inclination to &s;leep, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to keep him awake. Every me|thod mu&s;t however be tried for this purpo&s;e. He &s;hould be to&s;&s;ed, &s;haked, and moved about. Sharp bli&s;tering pla&s;ters &s;hould be applied to his legs or arms, and &s;timulating me|dicines, as &s;alts of hart&s;horn, &amp;c. held under his no&s;e. It will al&s;o be proper to let blood. At the &s;ame time every method mu&s;t be taken to make him di&s;charge the poi&s;on. This may be done in the manner directed above, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> by the u&s;e of &s;trong vomits, drinking plenty of warm water with oil, &amp;c.</P>
<P>MEAD, be&s;ides vomits, in this ca&s;e, recommends acid medicines with lixivial &s;alts. He &s;ays, that he has often
<PB N="311" REF="012338_0315_0F88EDDD133A87F8">
given &s;alt of wormwood mixed with juice of lemon in re|peated do&s;es with great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>IF the body &s;hould remain weak and languid after the poi&s;on has been di&s;charged, nouri&s;hing diet and cordials will be nece&s;&s;ary; but when there is rea&s;on to fear that the &s;to|mach or bowels are inflamed, the greate&s;t circum&s;pection is nece&s;&s;ary both with regard to food and medicine.</P>
<P>ANIMAL POISONS.&mdash;We &s;hall begin with the bite of a mad dog, as it is both the mo&s;t common and dangerous animal poi&s;on in this country.</P>
<P>THE creatures naturally liable to contract the hydropho|bia are, &s;o far as we yet know, all o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the dog-kind, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> dogs, foxes, and wolves. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the la&s;t we have none in this i&s;land; and it &s;o &s;eldom happens that any per&s;on is bit by the &s;econd, that they &s;carce de&s;erve to be taken notice of. If &s;uch a thing &s;hould happen, the method of treatment is preci&s;ely the &s;ame as for the bite of a mad dog.</P>
<P>THE &s;ymptoms of madne&s;s in a dog are as follow. At fir&s;t he looks dull, &s;hews an aver&s;ion to food and company: He does not bark as u&s;ual, but &s;eems to murmur, is peevi&s;h, and apt to bite &s;trangers: His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ars and tail droop more than u&s;ual, and he appears drow&s;y. Afterwards he begins to loll out his tongue, and froth at the mouth, his eyes &s;eeming heavy and watery. He now, if not confined, takes off, runs panting along with a kind of dejected air, and endea|vours to bite every one he meets. Other dogs are &s;aid to fly from him. Some think this a certain &s;ign of madne&s;s &s;up|po&s;ing that they know him by the &s;mell; but it is not to be depended on. If he e&s;capes being killed, he &s;eldom runs above two or three days, till he dies exhau&s;ted with heat, hunger, and fatigue.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e is mo&s;t frequent after long dry hot &s;ea&s;ons; and &s;uch dogs as live upon putrid &s;tinking carrion, without having enough of fre&s;h water, are mo&s;t liable to it.</P>
<P>WHEN any per&s;on is bit by a dog, the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry ought to be made, whether the animal be really mad. Many di&s;agreeable con&s;equences ari&s;e from neglecting to a&s;|certain this point. Some people have lived in continual anxiety for many years, becau&s;e they had been bit by a dog which they believed to be mad; but, as he had been killed on the &s;pot, it was impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the fact. This &s;hould induce us, in&s;tead of killing a dog the moment he
<PB N="312" REF="012338_0316_0F88EDDEAC726B00">
has bit any per&s;on, to do all in our power to keep him alive, at lea&s;t till we can be certain whether he be mad or not.</P>
<P>MANY circum&s;tances may contribute to make people imagine a dog mad. He lo&s;es his ma&s;ter, runs about in que&s;t of him, is &s;et upon by other dogs, and perhaps by men. The creature thus frightened, beat, and abu&s;ed, looks wild, and lolls out his tongue as he runs along. Immediately a crowd is after him; while he, finding him&s;elf clo&s;ely pur|&s;ued, and taking every one he meets for an enemy, natu|rally attempts to bite in &s;elf-defence. He &s;oon gets knock|ed on the head, and pa&s;&s;es currently for a mad dog, as it is then impo&s;&s;ible to prove the contrary.</P>
<P>THIS being the true hi&s;tory of, by far, the greater part of tho&s;e dogs which pa&s;s for mad, is it any wonder that numberle&s;s whim&s;ical medicines have been extolled for pre|venting the effects of their bite? This readily accounts for the great variety of infallable remedies for the bite of a mad dog, which are to be met with in almo&s;t every family. Though not one in a thou&s;and has any claim to merit, yet they are all &s;upported by numberle&s;s vouchers. No wonder that imaginary di&s;ea&s;es &s;hould be cured by imaginary reme|dies. In this way credulous people fir&s;t impo&s;e upon them|&s;elves, and then deceive others. The &s;ame medicine that was &s;uppo&s;ed to prevent the effects of the bite, when the dog was not mad, is recommended to a per&s;on who has had the misfortune to be bit by a dog that was really mad. He takes it, tru&s;ts to it, and is undone.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e mi&s;takes we mu&s;t impute the frequent ill &s;uc|ce&s;s in preventing the effects of the bite of a mad dog. It is not owing &s;o much to a defect in medicine, as to wrong applications. I am per&s;uaded if proper medicines were taken immediately after the bite is received, and continued for a &s;ufficient length of time, we &s;hould not lo&s;e one in a thou&s;and of tho&s;e who have the mi&s;fortune to be bit by a mad dog.</P>
<P>THIS poi&s;on is generally communicated by a wound, which, neverthele&s;s, heals as &s;oon as a common wound: But afterwards it begins to feel painful, and as the pain &s;preads towards the neighbouring parts, the per&s;on becomes heavy and li&s;tle&s;s. His &s;leep is unquiet with frightful dreams; he &s;ighs, looks dull, and loves &s;olitude. The&s;e are the forerunners, or rather the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms, of that dreadful di&s;ea&s;e occa&s;ioned by the bite of a mad dog. But
<PB N="313" REF="012338_0317_0F88EDDFC01A2F20">
as we do not propo&s;e to treat the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf, but to point out the method of preventing it, we &s;hall not take up time in &s;hewing its progre&s;s from the fir&s;t inva&s;ion to its com|monly fatal end.</P>
<P>THE common notion, that this poi&s;on may lie in the body for many years, and afterwards prove fatal, &s;eems not to be well founded. It mu&s;t render &s;uch per&s;ons as have had the misfortune to be bit very unhappy, and can have no good effects. If the per&s;on takes proper medicines for for|ty days after being bit, and feels no &s;ymptoms of the di&s;|ea&s;e, there is rea&s;on to believe him out of danger. Some indeed have gone mad twelve months after being bit; but I never knew it happen later; and of this I only remember to have &s;een one in&s;tance.</P>
<P>THE medicines recommended for preventing the effects of the bite of a mad dog, are chiefly &s;uch as promote urine and per&s;piration; to which may be added anti&s;pa&s;modics.</P>
<P>DR MEAD recommends a preventive medicine, which he &s;ays he never knew fail, though in the &s;pace of thirty years he had u&s;ed it a thou&s;and times.</P>
<P>THE medicine is as follows:</P>
<P>"TAKE a&s;h-coloured ground liver-wort, cleaned, dried, and powdered, half an ounce; of black pepper powdered, a quarter of an ounce. Mix the&s;e well together, and divide the powder into four do&s;es; one of which mu&s;t be taken every morning fa&s;ting, for four mornings &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, in half an Engli&s;h pint of cows milk warm.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e four do&s;es are taken, the patient mu&s;t go into the cold bath, or a cold &s;pring or river, every morning fa&s;ting, for a month; he mu&s;t be dipped all over, but not &s;tay in (with his head above water) longer than half a mi|nute, if the water be very cold. After this he mu&s;t go in three times a-week for a fortnight longer.</P>
<P>THE per&s;on mu&s;t be bled before he begins to u&s;e the me|dicine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I was, &s;ome time ago, favoured with the following pre&s;cription for the bite of a mad dog, which had been long kept a &s;ecret in a gentleman's family in the north of England, and is &s;aid never to have failed, when given as a preventive either to man or bea&s;t.&mdash;"Take &s;ix ounces of Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> clean picked and brui&s;ed, four ounces of garlic pealed and brui&s;ed, four ounces of Venice treacle, four ounces of &s;craped tin or pewter.

Le&s;s may be given to a young per&s;on, or one of a weak con&s;titution. Some of the ingredients may be bound upon the wound, if it can be conveni|ently done." This is ordered to be given within nine days after the bite. No doubt the &s;ooner it is given the better.&mdash;The do&s;e ordered for a hor&s;e is twelve &s;poonfuls, the &s;ame quantity for a bullock; and for a &s;heep, hog, or dog, four or five.</NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="012338_0318_0F88EDE06A20D9E0">
WE &s;hall next mention the famous Ea&s;t India &s;pecific, as it is called. This medicine is compo&s;ed of cinnabar and mu&s;k. It is e&s;teemed a great anti&s;pa&s;modic, and by many, thought to be an infallible remedy for preventing the effects of the bite of a mad dog.</P>
<P>"TAKE native and factitious cinnabar, of each twenty-four grains, mu&s;k &s;ixteen grains. Let the&s;e be made into a fine powder, and taken in a gla&s;s of arrack or brandy."</P>
<P>THIS &s;ingle do&s;e is &s;aid to &s;ecure the per&s;on for thirty days, at the end of which it mu&s;t be repeated; but if he has any &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, it mu&s;t be repeated in three hours.</P>
<P>THE following is likewi&s;e a good anti&s;pa&s;modic medicine.</P>
<P>TAKE of Virginian &s;nake-root in powder, half a dram, gum a&s;afoetida twelve grains, gum Camphire &s;even grains; make the&s;e into a bolus with a little &s;yrup of &s;affron.</P>
<P>CAMPHIRE may al&s;o be given in the following manner:</P>
<P>TAKE purified nitre half an ounce, Virginian &s;nake-root in powder two drams, camphire one dram; rub them toge|ther in a mortar, and divide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he whole into ten do&s;es.</P>
<P>MERCURY is another medicine of great efficacy, both in the prevention and cure of this kind of madne&s;s. When u&s;ed as a preventive, it will be &s;ufficient to rub daily a dram of the ointment into the parts about the wound.</P>
<P>VINEGAR is likewi&s;e of con&s;iderable &s;ervice, and &s;hould be taken freely, either in the patient's food or drink.</P>
<P>THESE are the principal medicines recommended for preventing the effects of the bite of a mad dog. We would not however advi&s;e people to tru&s;t to any one of them; but from a proper combination of their different powers, there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to hope for &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>THE great error in the u&s;e of the&s;e medicines lies in not taking them for a &s;ufficient length of time. They are u&s;ed more like charms than medicines intended to produce any change in the body. To this, and not to the in&s;ufficiency
<PB N="315" REF="012338_0319_0F88EDE20BE08ED0">
of the medicines, mu&s;t we impute their frequent want of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>DR MEAD &s;ays, that the virtue of his medicine con|&s;i&s;ts in promoting urine. But how a poi&s;on &s;hould be ex|pelled by urine, with only three or four do&s;es of any medi|cine, however powerful, is not ea&s;y to conceive. More time is certainly nece&s;&s;ary; and here the defect of the Doc|tor's pre&s;cription &s;eems to lie.</P>
<P>THE Ea&s;t-India &s;pecific is &s;till more exceptionable on this account.</P>
<P>AS the&s;e and mo&s;t other medicines, taken &s;ingly, have frequently been found to fail, we &s;hall recommend the fol|lowing cour&s;e.</P>
<P>IF a per&s;on be bit in a fle&s;hly part, where there is no hazard of hurting any large blood-ve&s;&s;el, the parts adjacent to the wound may be cut away. But if this be not done &s;oon after receiving the bite, it will be better to omit it.</P>
<P>THE wound may be wa&s;hed with &s;alt and water, or a pickle made of vinegar and &s;alt, and afterwards dre&s;&s;ed twice a-day with yellow ba&s;ilicon mixed with &s;ome red pre|cipitate.</P>
<P>THE patient &s;hould begin to u&s;e either Dr Mead's me|dicine, or &s;ome of the others mentioned above. If he takes Mead's medicine he may u&s;e it as the Doctor directs for four days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. Let him then omit it for two or three days, and again repeat the &s;ame number of do&s;es as before.</P>
<P>DURING this cour&s;e, he mu&s;t rub into the parts about the wound, daily, one dram of the mercurial or blue oint|ment, as it is called. This may be done for ten or twelve days at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>WHEN this cour&s;e is over, he may take a purge or two, and then begin to u&s;e the cold bath. This mu&s;t be u&s;ed every morning for five or &s;ix weeks; but if the patient &s;hould feel cold and chilly for a long time after coming out of the cold bath, it will be better to u&s;e a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pid one, or to have the water <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> little warmed.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, we would advi&s;e him not to leave off all internal medicines, but to take either one of the bolu&s;es of &s;nake-root, a&s;afoetida and camphire; or one of the pow|ders of nitre, camphire, and &s;nake-root, twice a-day. The&s;e may be continued for a fortnight or three weeks longer.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="012338_0320_0F88EDE2B5915548">
IF the per&s;on has gone through the above cour&s;e of me|dicine, and no &s;ymptoms of madne&s;s appear, he may be reckoned out of danger. It will neverthele&s;s be advi&s;eable, for the greater &s;afety, to take a do&s;e or two of Dr Mead's medicine, at every full or change of the moon, for the three or four &s;ucceeding months.</P>
<P>DURING the u&s;e of the mercurial ointment, the patient mu&s;t keep within doors, and take nothing cold.</P>
<P>A PROPER regimen mu&s;t be ob&s;erved during the whole cour&s;e. The patient &s;hould ab&s;tain from fle&s;h, and all &s;alt|ed and high-&s;ea&s;oned provi&s;ions. He mu&s;t avoid &s;trong li|quors, and live mo&s;tly upon a light and rather &s;pare diet. His mind &s;hould be kept as ea&s;y and cheerful as po&s;&s;ible, and all exce&s;&s;ive heat and violent pa&s;&s;ions avoided with the utmo&s;t care.</P>
<P>I HAVE never &s;een this cour&s;e of medicine, with proper regimen, fail to prevent the hydrophobia, and cannot help again ob&s;erving, that the want of &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t generally be owing either to the application of improper medicines, or not u&s;ing proper ones for a &s;ufficient length of time.</P>
<P>MANKIND are extremely fond of every thing that promi|&s;es a &s;udden or miraculous cure. By tru&s;ting to the&s;e they often lo&s;e their lives, when a regular cour&s;e of medicine would have rendered them ab&s;olutely &s;afe. This holds re|markably in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e: Numbers of people, for ex|ample, believe if they or their cattle be once dipped in the &s;ea, it is &s;ufficient: as if the &s;alt water were a charm again&s;t the effects of the bite. This and &s;uch like whims have proved fatal to many.</P>
<P>SOME people believe, if a per&s;on be bit by a dog that is not m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d, if he &s;hould go mad afterwards, that the per&s;on will be &s;eized with the di&s;order at the &s;ame time. This no|tion is too ridiculous to de&s;erve a &s;erious confutation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;urpri&s;ing that no proper inquiry has ever been made into the truth of the common opinion, that a dog which has been wormed can|not bite after he goes mad.

<P>THE next poi&s;onous animal that we &s;hall mention is the VIPER. The grea&s;e of this animal rubbed into the wound is generally reckoned a cure for the bite. Though this is all that the viper-catchers commonly do when they are

bit, I &s;hould hardly think it &s;ufficient for the bite of an <HI>enraged</HI> viper. It would &s;urely be more &s;afe to have the wound well &s;ucked,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The practice of &s;ucking out poi&s;ons is very ancient; and indeed nothing can be more rational. It is the mo&s;t likely method of extract|ing the poi&s;on where the bite cannot be cut out. There is no danger in performing this office; as the poi&s;on does no harm unle&s;s it be taken into the body by a wound. The per&s;on who &s;ucks the wound ought however to wa&s;h his mouth frequently with &s;alad-oil, which will &s;ecure him from even the lea&s;t inconveniency. The ancient P&s;ylli in Africa, and the Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i in Italy were famed for curing the bites of poi&s;onous ani|mals by &s;ucking the wound; and we are told, that the Indians in North America practice the &s;ame at this day.</NOTE> and afterwards rubbed with warm &s;a|lad oil. A poultice of bread and milk, with plenty of &s;alad oil in it, &s;hould likewi&s;e be applied to the wound, and the patient ought to drink freely of wine whey with &s;ome &s;pirits of hart&s;hhorn; or, if that be not at hand, of water gruel with vinegar in it, to make him &s;weat. If the patient be &s;ick, he may take a vomit. This cour&s;e will be &s;ufficient for the bite of any of the poi&s;onous animals of this country.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE STONE AND GRAVEL.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN &s;mall &s;tones are lodged in the kidneys, or di&s;|charged along with the urine, the patient is &s;aid to be afflic|ted with gravel.

<P>SYMPTOMS.&mdash;SMALL &s;tones or gravel in the kidneys occa&s;ion pain in the loins; &s;ickne&s;s; vomiting; and &s;ometimes bloody urine. When the &s;tone de&s;cends into the <HI>ureter,</HI> and is too large to pa&s;s along with ea&s;e, all the above &s;ymptoms are increa&s;ed; the pain extends to|wards the bladder; the thigh and leg of the affected &s;ide feel benumbed; the te&s;ticles are drawn upwards, and the urine is ob&s;tructed.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="012338_0323_0F88EDE4EC101EF0">
A STONE in the bladder is known from a pain at the time, as well as before and after making water; from the urine coming away by drops, or &s;topping &s;uddenly when in a full &s;tream; by a violent pain in the neck of the blad|der upon motion, e&s;pecially on hor&s;eback or in a coach on rough road; from a white, thick, copious, &s;tinking, mu|cous &s;ediment in the urine; from an itching in the top of the <HI>penis;</HI> from an inclination to go to &s;tool while the urine is di&s;charged; from the patient's pa&s;&s;ing his urine more ea|&s;ily when lying than in an erect po&s;ture; and from a kind of convul&s;ive motion occa&s;ioned by the &s;harp pain in di&s;|charging the la&s;t drops of the urine.</P>
<P>REGIMEN.&mdash;Per&s;ons afflicted with the gravel or &s;tone &s;hould, avoid aliments of a windy or heating nature, as &s;alt-meats, &s;our fruits, &amp;c. Their diet ought chiefly to con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch things as tend to promote the &s;ecretion of u|rine, and to keep the belly open. Artichoaks, a&s;paragus, &s;pinnage, lettuces, &s;uccory, par&s;ley, pur&s;lane, turnip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, po|tatoes, carrots, and radi&s;hes may be &s;afely eat. Onions, leeks, and cellery are, in this ca&s;e, reckoned medicinal. The mo&s;t proper drink is whey, butter-milk, milk and wa|ter, barley-water; decoctions of the roots of mar&s;hmallows, par&s;ley, liquorice; or of other mild mucilaginous vegetables, as lin&s;eed, &amp;c. If the patient has been accu&s;tomed to gene|rous liquors, he may drink &s;mall gin-punch without acid. But &s;pirits mu&s;t be u&s;ed very &s;paringly, as every thing that heats is hurtful.</P>
<P>GENTLE exerci&s;e is proper; but if violent, it is apt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> occca&s;ion bloody urine. We would therefore advi&s;e that it &s;hould be taken in moderation. Per&s;ons afflicted with gra|vel often pa&s;s a great number of &s;tones after riding on hor&s;e|back, or in a machine; but tho&s;e who have a &s;tone in the bladder are &s;eldom able to bear the&s;e kinds of exerci&s;e. Where there is a hereditary tendency to this di&s;ea&s;e, a &s;e|dentary life ought never to be indulged. Were people care|ful, upon the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of gravel, to ob&s;erve a pro|per regimen of diet, and to take &s;ufficient exerci&s;e, it might often be carried off, or, at lea&s;t, prevented from in|crea&s;ing; but if the &s;ame cour&s;e which occa&s;ioned the di&s;|ea&s;e be per&s;i&s;ted in, it cannot fail to become wor&s;e.</P>
<P>MEDICINE.&mdash;In what is called a fit of the gra|vel, which is commonly occa&s;ioned by a &s;tone &s;ticking in the <HI>ureter</HI> or &s;ome part of the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, the patient mu&s;t

<P>DR WHYTT advi&s;es patients who are &s;ubject to fre|quent fits of gravel in the kidneys, but have no &s;tone in the bladder, to drink every morning, two or three hours before breakfa&s;t, an Engli&s;h pint of oy&s;ter or cockle-&s;hell lime-water. The Doctor very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that though this quantity might be too &s;mall to have any &s;en&s;ible effect in di&s;&s;olving a &s;tone in the bladder; yet it may very probably prevent its growth.</P>
<P>WHEN a &s;tone is formed in the bladder, the Doctor re|commends Alicant &s;oap, and oy&s;ter or cockle-&s;hell lime-water<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oy&s;ter-&s;hell lime-water is prepared by pouring an Engli&s;h gallon and a half of boiling water upon a pound of oy&s;ter-&s;hells reduced to quick-lime by being burnt. Where oy&s;ter or cockle-&s;hells cannot be had, common quick lime may be u&s;ed in their &s;tead. After the clear liquor has been poured off, the &s;ame quantity of time will make a &s;e|cond or third quantity of water of nearly the &s;ame &s;trength as the fir&s;t.</NOTE> to be taken in the following manner. The patient mu&s;t &s;wallow every day, in any form that is lea&s;t di&s;agreea|ble, an ounce of the internal part of Alicant &s;oap, and drink three or four Engli&s;h pints of oy&s;ter or cockle-&s;hell lime-water. The &s;oap is to be divided into three do&s;es; the large&s;t to be taken fa&s;ting in the morning early; the &s;e|cond at noon; and the third at &s;even in the evening, drinking above each do&s;e a large draught of the lime-water; the remainder of which he may take any time betwixt din|ner and &s;upper, in&s;tead of other liquors.</P>
<P>THE patient &s;hould begin with a &s;maller quantity of the lime-water and &s;oap than what is mentioned above; at fir&s;t an Engli&s;h pint of the former and three drams of the latter, taken daily, may be enough. This quantity, however, he may increa&s;e by degrees, and ought to per&s;evere in the u&s;e of the&s;e medicines, e&s;pecially if he finds any abatement of his complaints, for &s;everal months; nay, if the &s;tone be very large, for years. It may likewi&s;e be proper for the patient, if he be &s;everely pained, not only to begin with the &s;oap and lime-water in &s;mall quantities, but to take the &s;econd or third lime-water in&s;tead of the fir&s;t. However, after he has been for &s;ome time accu&s;tomed to the&s;e medi|cines

he may not only take the fir&s;t water, but, if he finds he can ea&s;ily bear it, heighten its di&s;&s;olving power &s;till more by pouring it a &s;econd time on fre&s;h calcined &s;hells.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE HICCUP.</HEAD>
<P>THE hiccup is a &s;pa&s;modic or convul&s;ive affection of the &s;tomach and midriff, ari&s;ing from any cau&s;e that irritates their nervous fibres.</P>
<P>IT may proceed from exce&s;s in eating or drinking; from a hurt of the &s;tomach; poi&s;ons; inflammations of the &s;to|mach, inte&s;tines, bladder, midriff, or the re&s;t of the <HI>vi&s;cera.</HI> In gangrenes, acute and malignant fevers, a hiccup is often the forerunner of death.

<P>WHEN the hiccup proceeds from exce&s;s, e&s;pecially from aliment that is flatulent, or hard of dige&s;tion, a draught of generous wine, or a dram of any &s;piritous liquor, will ge|nerally remove it. If poi&s;on be the cau&s;e, plenty of milk and oil mu&s;t be drank, as has been formerly recommended. When it proceeds from an inflammation of the &s;tomach, &amp;c. it is very dangerous. In this ca&s;e the cooling regimen mu&s;t be ob&s;erved. The patient mu&s;t be bled, and take frequent|ly a few drops of the &s;weet &s;pirits of nitre in a cup of wine-whey. His &s;tomach mu&s;t likewi&s;e be fomented with cloths dipped in warm water; or bladders filled with warm milk and water applied to it.</P>
<P>A HICCUP proceeding from a gangrene, or mortificati|on, is generally incurable. In this ca&s;e the Peruvian bark, with other anti&s;eptic medicines, are mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed.

a gentle vomit and purge, if the patient be able to bear them, will be of &s;ervice. If it ari&s;es from flatulencies, the carminatives directed for the heart-burn, page 255. mu&s;t be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>WHEN the hiccup proves very ob&s;tinate, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to the mo&s;t powerful aromatic and anti&s;pa&s;modic medicines. The principal of the&s;e is mu&s;k; fifteen or twenty grains of which may be made into a bolus, and re|peated occa&s;ionally. Opiates are likewi&s;e of &s;ervice; but they mu&s;t be u&s;ed with caution. A bit of &s;ugar dipped in compound &s;pirits of lavender, or the volatile aromatic tinc|ture, may be taken frequently. The Peruvian bark is like|wi&s;e of u&s;e. External applications are &s;ometimes al&s;o be|neficial; as the &s;tomach pla&s;ter, or a catapla&s;m of the Ve|nice treacle of the Edinburgh or London di&s;pen&s;atory, ap|plied to the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>I LATELY attended a patient who had almo&s;t a con&s;tant hiccup for above nine weeks. It was frequently &s;topped by the u&s;e of mu&s;k, opium, wine, and other cordial and anti|&s;pa&s;modic medicines, but always returned. Nothing in|deed gave the patient &s;o much ea&s;e as bri&s;k &s;mall beer. By drinking freely of this, the hiccup was often kept off for &s;everal days, which was more than could be done by the mo&s;t powerful medicines. He was at length &s;eized with a vomiting of blood, which &s;oon put an end to his life.

Per&s;ons of weak nerves, who lead a &s;edentary life, and live full, are mo&s;t commonly afflicted with the night-mare. Nothing tends more to produce it than heavy &s;uppers, e&s;pecially if eat late, or the patient goes to bed &s;oon after. Wind is like|wi&s;e a very frequent cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e; for which rea&s;on tho&s;e who are afflicted with it ought to avoid all flatulent food. Deep thought, anxiety, or any thing that oppre&s;&s;es the mind, ought al&s;o to be avoided.</P>
<P>PERSONS afflicted with the night-mare ought to eat very light &s;uppers. They &s;hould never go to bed immediately after eating, nor lie upon their back with the head low. As they generally moan, or make &s;ome noi&s;e in the fit, they &s;hould be waked, or &s;poken to by &s;uch as hear them, as the unea&s;ine&s;s generally goes off as &s;oon as the patient is awake. Dr Whytt &s;ays he generally found a dram of brandy, taken at bed-time, prevent this di&s;ea&s;e. That, however, is a bad cu&s;tom, and, in time, lo&s;es its effect. We would rather have the patient depend upon cheerfulne&s;s, and exerci&s;e through the day, a light &s;upper taken early, and the u&s;e of food of ea&s;y dige&s;tion, &amp;c. than to accu&s;tom him&s;elf to drams. A draught of cold water will often promote dige&s;tion as much as a gla&s;s of brandy, and is much &s;afer. After a per|&s;on of weak dige&s;tion however has eat flatulent food, a dram may be nece&s;&s;ary; in this ca&s;e we would recommend it as the mo&s;t proper medicine.</P>
<P>PERSONS who are young, and full of blood, if troubled with the night-mare, ought to purge, bleed, and u&s;e a &s;pare diet.</P>

<HEAD>OF SWOONINGS.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal cau&s;es of &s;wooning are, &s;udden tran&s;iti|ons from cold to heat; breathing air that is deprived of its proper &s;pring or ela&s;ticity; great fatigue; exce&s;&s;ive weak|ne&s;s; lo&s;s of blood; long fa&s;ting; fear, grief, and other vi|olent pa&s;&s;ions or affections of the mind.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that per&s;ons who have been long ex|po&s;ed to cold, often faint or fall into a &s;woon, upon coming into the hou&s;e, e&s;pecially if they drink hot liquor, or &s;it near a large fire. This might ea&s;ily be prevented by peo|ple
<PB N="327" REF="012338_0331_0F88EDF06C3B9BC0">
taking care not to go into a warm room immediately after having been expo&s;ed to the cold air, to approach the fire gradually, and not to eat or drink any thing hot, till the body has been gradually brought into a warm tempera|ture.</P>
<P>WHEN any one, in con&s;equence of neglecting the&s;e pre|cautions, falls into &s;woon, he ought immediately to be re|moved to a cooler apartment, to have ligatures applied above his knees and elbows, and to have his hands and face &s;prinkled with vinegar. He &s;hould likewi&s;e be made to &s;mell to vinegar, and &s;hould have a &s;poonful or two of wa|ter, if he can &s;wallow, with about a third part of vinegar mixed with it, poured into his mouth. If the fainting fits prove ob&s;tinate, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to bleed the patient, and afterwards to give him a cly&s;ter,</P>
<P>As air that is breathed over and over lo&s;es its ela&s;ticity or &s;pring, it is no wonder if per&s;ons who re&s;pire in it often fall into &s;wooning or fainting fits. They are, in this ca&s;e, deprived of the very principle of life. Hence it is that fainting fits are &s;o frequent in all crowded a&s;&s;emblies, e&s;pe|cially in hot &s;ea&s;ons. Such fits however mu&s;t be con&s;ider|ed as a kind of temporary death; and, to the weak and de|licate, they &s;ometimes prove fatal in reality. They ought therefore to be avoided with the utmo&s;t care. The method of doing this is obvious. Let a&s;&s;embly rooms, and all o|ther places of public re&s;ort, be well ventilated; and let the weak and delicate avoid &s;uch places, particularly in warm &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>A PERSON who faints, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, ought im|mediately to be carried into the open air; his temples &s;hould be rubbed with &s;trong vinegar or brandy, and volatile &s;pi|rits or &s;alts held to his no&s;e. He &s;hould be laid upon his back with his head low, and have a little wine, or &s;ome o|ther cordial, poured into his mouth, as &s;oon as he is able to &s;wallow it. If the per&s;on has been &s;ubject to hy&s;teric fits, ca&s;tor or a&s;afoetida &s;hould be applied to the no&s;e, or burnt feathers, horn, or leather, &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHEN fainting fits proceed from mere weakne&s;s or ex|hau&s;tion, which is often the ca&s;e after great fatigue, long fa&s;ting, lo&s;s of blood, or the like, the patient mu&s;t be &s;up|ported with generous cordials, as jellies, wines, &s;pirituous liquors, &amp;c. The&s;e however mu&s;t be given at fir&s;t in very &s;mall quantities, and increa&s;ed gradually as the patient is
<PB N="328" REF="012338_0332_0F88EDF0F1B839C8">
able to bear them. He ought to be allowed to lie quite &s;till and ea&s;y upon his back, with his head low, and &s;hould have fre&s;h air admitted into his chamber. His food &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of nouri&s;hing broths, &s;ago-gruel with wine, new milk, and other things of a light and cordial nature. The&s;e things are to be given out of the fit. All that can be done while the per&s;on continues in the fit is, to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t him &s;mell to a bottle of Hungary water, <HI>eau de luc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> or &s;pirits of hart&s;|horn, and to rub his temples with warm brandy, or to lay a compre&s;s dipped in it to the pit of his &s;tomach.</P>
<P>IN fainting fits that proceed from fear, grief, or other vi|olent pa&s;&s;ions to affections of the mind, the patient mu&s;t be very cautiou&s;ly managed. He &s;hould be &s;uffered to remain at re&s;t, and only made to &s;mell to &s;ome vinegar. After he has come to him&s;elf he may drink freely of warm lemonade, or balm tea, with &s;ome orange or lemon peel in it. It will likewi&s;e be proper, if the fainting fits have been long and &s;evere, to clean the bowels by throwing in an emolient cly&s;ter or two.</P>

<HEAD>DISEASES OF WOMEN.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;es peculiar to women ari&s;e chiefly from their monthly evacuations, pregnancy, and child-birth. Fe|males generally begin to men&s;truate about the age of fif|teen, and leave it off about fifty, which renders the&s;e two periods the mo&s;t critical of their lives. About the fir&s;t ap|pearance of this di&s;charge the con&s;titution undergoes a very con&s;iderable change, generally indeed for the better, but &s;ometimes for the wor&s;e. The greate&s;t care is now nece&s;&s;a|ry, as the future health and happine&s;s of the female depends, in a great mea&s;ure, upon her conduct at this period. If a girl about this time of life be confined to the hou&s;e, kept con&s;tantly &s;itting, and neither allowed to romp about, nor employed in &s;ome active bu&s;ine&s;s, which gives exerci&s;e to the whole body, &s;he becomes weak, relaxed and puny; her blood not being duly prepared, &s;he looks pale and wan; her health, &s;pirits, and vigor decline, and &s;he &s;inks into a valetudinary for life. Such is the fate of numbers of tho&s;e unhappy females who either from the indulgence of mo|thers, or their own narrow circum&s;tances, are, at this cri|tical period of life, denied the benefit of exerci&s;e and free air.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="012338_0333_0F88EDF1C0D11370">
A LAZY indolent di&s;po&s;ition proves very hurtful to girls at this period. One &s;eldom meets with complaints from ob&s;tructions among&s;t the more active and laborious part of the &s;ex; whereas the indolent and lazy are &s;eldom free from them. The&s;e are, in a manner, eat up by the <HI>chloro&s;is,</HI> or green &s;ickne&s;s, and other di&s;ea&s;es of this nature. We would therefore recommend it to all who wi&s;h to e&s;cape the&s;e calamities, to avoid indolence and inactivity, as their greate&s;t enemies, and to take as much exerci&s;e, e&s;pecially in the open air, as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing that proves very hurtful to girls about this period of life, is unwhole&s;ome food. Fond of all man|ner of tra&s;h, they often eat every out-of-the-way thing they can get, till their blood and humours are quite vitiated. Hence en&s;ue indige&s;tions, want of appetite, and a whole train of evils. If the fluids be not duly prepared, it is ut|terly impo&s;&s;ible that the &s;ecretions &s;hould be properly per|formed; Accordingly we find that &s;uch girls as lead an in|dolent life, and eat great quantities of tra&s;h, are not only &s;ubject to ob&s;tructions of the <HI>men&s;es,</HI> but likewi&s;e to glan|dular ob&s;tructions; as the &s;crophula or King's evil, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A DULL di&s;po&s;ition is likewi&s;e very hurtful to girls at this period. It is a rare thing to &s;ee a &s;prightly girl who does not enjoy good health, while the grave, moping, me|lancholy creature proves the very prey of vapours and hy|&s;tericks. Youth is the &s;ea&s;on for mirth and cheerfulne&s;s. Let it therefore be indulged. It is an ab&s;olute duty. To lay in a &s;tock of health in time of youth is as nece&s;&s;ary a piece of prudence as to make provi&s;ion again&s;t the decays of old age. While therefore wi&s;e Nature prompts the hap|py youth to join in &s;prightly amu&s;ements, let not the &s;evere dictates of hoary age forbid the u&s;eful impul&s;e, nor damp with &s;erious gloom the &s;ea&s;ons de&s;tined to mirth a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> inno|cent fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing very hurtful to females about this p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|od of life is &s;trait cloaths. They are fond of a fine &s;hape, and fooli&s;hly imagine, that this can be acquired by &s;trait cloaths. Hence by &s;queezing their &s;tomach and bowels they hurt the dige&s;tion, and occa&s;ion many incurable ma|ladies. This error is not indeed &s;o common as it has been; but, as fa&s;hions change, it may come in again, we there|fore think it not improper to mention it. I know many fe|males who, to this day, feel the direful effects of that
<PB N="330" REF="012338_0334_0F88EDF277F253A0">
wretched cu&s;tom which prevailed &s;ome time ago, of &s;queez|ing every girl into as &s;mall a &s;ize in the middle as po&s;&s;ible. Human invention could not po&s;&s;ibly have devi&s;ed a practice more de&s;tructive to health.</P>
<P>AFTER a female has arrived at that period of life when the <HI>men&s;es</HI> u&s;ually begin to flow, and they do not appear, but, on the contrary, her health and &s;pirits begin to de|cline, we would advi&s;e, in&s;tead of &s;hutting the poor girl up in the hou&s;e, and do&s;ing her with &s;teel, a&s;afoetida, and o|ther nau&s;eous drugs, to place her in a &s;ituation where &s;he can enjoy the benefit of free air and agreeable company. There let her eat whole&s;ome food, take plenty of exerci&s;e and amu&s;ements, and we have little rea&s;on to fear but Na|ture, thus a&s;&s;i&s;ted, will do her proper work. She &s;eldom fails unle&s;s where the fault is on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>men&s;es</HI> have once begun to flow, the greate&s;t care &s;hould be taken to avoid every thing that may tend to ob&s;truct them. Females ought to be exceeding careful of what they eat or drink at the time they are out of order. Every thing that is cold, or apt to &s;our on the &s;tomach, ought to be avoided; as fruit, butter milk, and &s;uch like. Fi&s;h, and all kinds of food that are hard of dige&s;tion, are al&s;o to be avoided. As it is impo&s;&s;ible to mention every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that may di&s;agree with individuals at this time, we would recommend it to every female to be very attentive to what di&s;agrees with her own &s;tomach, and carefully to a|void it.</P>
<P>COLD is extremely hurtful to females at this particular period. More of the &s;ex date their di&s;orders from colds, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> while they were out of order, than from all other cau&s;es. This ought &s;urely to put them upon their guard, and to make them very circum&s;pect in their conduct at &s;uch times. A degree of cold that will not in the lea&s;t hurt them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> another time, will, at this period, be &s;ufficient to ruin their health and con&s;titution altogether.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t attention ought at this time to be paid to the mind, which &s;hould be kept as ea&s;y and cheerful as po&s;&s;ible. Every part of the animal oeconomy is influenced by the pa&s;&s;ions, but none more &s;o than this. Anger, fear, grief, and other affections of the mind, often occa&s;ion ob|&s;tructions of the men&s;trual flux, which prove ab&s;olutely in|curable.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="012338_0335_0F88EDF347752A18">
FROM whatever cau&s;e this flux is ob&s;tructed, unle&s;s the female be pregnant, proper means &s;hould be u&s;ed to re&s;tore it. For this purpo&s;e we would rcommend plenty of exerci&s;e, in a dry, open, and rather cool air; whole&s;ome diet, and, if the body be weak and languid, generous liquors; al&s;o cheerful company, and all manner of amu&s;ements. If the&s;e fail, the following medicines may be tried.</P>
<P>IF the ob&s;tructions proceed from a weak relaxed &s;tate of the &s;olids, &s;uch medicines as tend to promote dige&s;tion, to brace the &s;olids, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the body in preparing good blood, ought to be u&s;ed. The principal of the&s;e are iron, the je|&s;uits bark, and other bitter and a &s;tringent medicines. Fi|lings of iron may be infu&s;ed in wine or ale, two ounces to an Engli&s;h quart, and after it has &s;tood in a warm place twenty four hours, it may be &s;trained, and a &s;mall cupful drank three or four times a-day; or they may be reduced to a fine powder, and taken in the do&s;e of half a dram, mixed with a little honey or treacle, three or four times a-day. The bark and other bitters may either be taken in &s;ub&s;tance or infu&s;ion as is mo&s;t agreeable to the patient.</P>
<P>WHEN ob&s;tructions proceed from a vi&s;cid &s;tate of the blood, and the patient is of a gro&s;s full habit, evacuations, and &s;uch medicines as attenuate the humours, are nece&s;&s;a|ry. The patient, in this ca&s;e ought to be bled, to bathe her feet frequently in warm water, to take now and then a do&s;e of cooling phy&s;ic, and to live upon a &s;pare thin diet. Her drink &s;hould be whey, water, or &s;mall beer, and &s;he ought to take plenty of exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN ob&s;tructions proceed from affections of the mind, every method &s;hould be taken to amu&s;e and divert the pati|ent. And that &s;he may the more readily forget the cau&s;e of her affliction, &s;he ought, if po&s;&s;ible, to be removed from the place where it happened. A change of place, by pre|&s;enting the mind with a variety of new objects, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> often a very happy influence in relieving it from the deepe&s;t di&s;|tre&s;s. A &s;oothing, kind, and affable behaviour to per&s;ons in this &s;ituation is al&s;o of the la&s;t importance. This would often prevent, the fatal con&s;equences which proceed from a <HI>har&s;h</HI> treatment of females, who are &s;o unfortunate as to be cro&s;&s;ed in their inclinations; or who meet with di&s;appoint|ments in love, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THO' many di&s;ea&s;es proceed from ob&s;truction, it is not always to be con&s;idered as the cau&s;e, but often as the ef|fect
<PB N="332" REF="012338_0336_0F88EDF426960D40">
of other maladies. When that is the ca&s;e, in&s;tead of giving medicines to force down the <HI>men&s;es,</HI> which might be dangerous, we ought, by all means, to endeavour to re&s;tore the patient's health and &s;trength. When that is effected the other will return of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT the men&s;trual flux may be too great as well as too &s;mall. When that is the ca&s;e, the patient becomes weak, the colour pale, the appetite and dige&s;tion are bad, and oedematous &s;wellings of the feet, drop&s;ies and con&s;umpti|ons often en&s;ue. This frequently happens to women about the age of forty five or fifty, and is very difficult to cure. It may proceed from a &s;edentary life; a full diet, con&s;i&s;t|ing chiefly of &s;alted, high-&s;ea&s;oned, or acrid food; the ex|ce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;piritous liquors; too much exerci&s;e; violent pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, &amp;c.</P>
<P>TO re&s;train this flux, the patient ought to be kept quiet and ea&s;y both in body and mind. If it be very violent, &s;he ought to lie in bed with her head low; to live upon a cool and &s;lender diet, as veal or chicken-broths with bread; and to drink decoctions of nettle-roots, or the greater con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rey. If the&s;e be not &s;ufficient to &s;top the flux, &s;tronger a&s;tringents may be u&s;ed, as allum, dragons blood, &amp;c. As much powdered allum as will lie upon a &s;ixpence may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> taken in a gla&s;s of red wine twice or thrice a-day, or oftener if the patient's &s;tomach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> bear it. Such as cannot take allum in &s;ub&s;tance may u&s;e the allum-whey. Females who have frequent returns of this complaint, ought to u&s;e the je&s;uits bark for a con&s;iderable time. Half a dram of bark may be mixed in a gla&s;s of red wine three or four times a-day, or it may be taken in common water, and &s;harpened with &s;pi|rits of vitriol.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>uterine flux</HI> may offend in quality as well as in quantity. What is u&s;ually called the <HI>fluor albus</HI> or whites, is a very common di&s;ea&s;e, and proves extremely hurtful to delicate women. This di&s;charge is not always white, but &s;ometimes pale, yellow, green, or of a blacki&s;h colour; &s;ometimes it is &s;harp and corro&s;ive; &s;ometimes foul and foe|tid, &amp;c. It is attended with a pale complexion, pain in the &s;pine of the back, lo&s;s of appetite, &s;welling of the feet, &amp;c. It generally proceeds from a relaxed and debilitated &s;tate of the body, ari&s;ing from indolence, the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of tea, coffee, or other weak and watery diet.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="012338_0337_0F88EDF4AD199BC8">
TO remove this di&s;ea&s;e, the patient mu&s;t take as much exerci&s;e as &s;he can bear without fatigue. Her food mu&s;t be &s;olid and nouri&s;hing, but of ea&s;y dige&s;tion; and her drink pretty generous, as red port or claret wine. The&s;e may be drank pure or mixed with water, as the patient inclines. Tea and coffee are to be avoided. I have often known &s;trong broths have an exceeding good effect in this ca&s;e. The patient ought not to lie too long a bed. When medi|cine is wanted, we know none preferable to the je&s;uits bark, which, in this ca&s;e, ought always to be taken in &s;ubstance.</P>
<P>THAT period of life at which the <HI>men&s;es</HI> cea&s;e to flow is likewi&s;e very critical to the &s;ex. The &s;toppage of any cu&s;tomary evacuation, however &s;mall, is &s;ufficient to di&s;|order the whole frame, and often to de&s;troy life itself. Hence it comes to pa&s;s that &s;o many women either fall into chronic di&s;orders, or die about this time: Such of them however as &s;urvive it, without contracting any chronic di&s;|ea&s;e, often become more healthy and hardy than they were before, and enjoy &s;trength and vigour to a very great age.</P>
<P>IF the <HI>men&s;es</HI> cea&s;e all of a &s;udden, in women of a full ha|bit, they ought to abate &s;omewhat of their u&s;ual quantity of food, e&s;pecially of the more nouri&s;hing kind, as fle&s;h, eggs, &amp;c. They ought likewi&s;e to take plenty of exerci&s;e, and to keep the belly open. This may be done by taking, once or twice a-week, a little rhubarb, or an infu&s;ion of hiera picra in wine or brandy.</P>
<P>IT often happens that women of a gro&s;s habit, at this pe|riod of life, have ulcerous &s;ores break out about their an|cles, or in other parts of the body. Such ulcers ought to be con&s;idered as critical, and &s;hould either be &s;uffered to continue open, or artificial drains &s;hould be opened in their &s;tead. Women who will needs have &s;uch &s;ores dried up, are often &s;oon after &s;eized with acute or chronic di&s;ea&s;es, of which they die.</P>
<P>PERSONS of either &s;ex ought to be very cautious in drying up &s;ores which break out towards the decline of life. We would lay it down as a rule, where ever &s;uch &s;ores appear, that before any attempts be made to heal them, an i&s;&s;ue or &s;eton &s;hould be &s;et in &s;ome part of the body. Few things bid fairer for pre&s;erving health, or prolonging life, e&s;peci|ally in per&s;ons who live full, than an i&s;&s;ue, or &s;ome other drain con&s;tantly kept open in the decline of life.

<HEAD>OF PREGNANCY.</HEAD>
<P>PREGNANCY is not a di&s;ea&s;e, but as it &s;ubjects women to &s;everal ailments, it may not be improper to point out the methods of preventing or relieving them.</P>
<P>PREGNANT women are often afflicted with the heart|burn. The method of treating this complaint has already been pointed out in page 254. and the one following. They are likewi&s;e, in the more early periods of pregnancy, often harra&s;&s;ed with &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting, e&s;pecially in the morn|ing. The&s;e complaints may generally be relieved by care|fully ob&s;erving the directions contained in pages 244. and 245. The head-ach and tooth-ach are al&s;o very trouble&s;ome &s;ymp|toms of pregnancy. The former may generally be removed by keeping the belly gently open, by the u&s;e of prunes, figs, roa&s;ted apples, and &s;uch like. When the pain is very vio|lent, bleeding may be nece&s;&s;ary. For the treatment of the latter, we mu&s;t refer the reader to that article page 249.</P>
<P>EVERY pregnant woman is more or le&s;s in danger of a|bortion. This &s;hould be guarded again&s;t with greate&s;t care, as it not only weakens the con&s;titution, but renders the woman liable to the &s;ame misfortune afterwards. Abor|tion may happen at any period of pregnancy, but it is mo&s;t common in the &s;econd or third month. Sometimes howe|ver it happens in the fourth or fifth. If it happens within the fir&s;t month, it is u&s;ually called a fal&s;e conception; if after the &s;eventh month, the child may often be kept alive by proper care.</P>
<P>THE common cau&s;es of abortion are, the death of the child; weakne&s;s or relaxation of the mother; great evacua|ations; violent motion; rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing great weights; reaching too high; vomiting; coughing; convul&s;ion-fits; &s;trokes on the belly; falls; fevers; di&s;agreeable &s;mells; exce&s;s of blood; indolence; high living; or the contrary; violent pa&s;&s;ions or affections of the mind, as fear, grief, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE &s;igns of approaching abortion are, a pain in the joins, or about the bottom of the belly; a dull heavy pain in the in&s;ide of the thighs; a flight degree of coldne&s;s or &s;hivering; &s;ickne&s;s; palpitation of the heart; the brea&s;ts

<P>TO prevent abortion, we would advi&s;e women of a weak or relaxed habit to u&s;e &s;olid food, avoiding great quantities of tea, and other weak and watery liquors; to ri&s;e early, and go &s;oon to bed; to &s;hun damp hou&s;es; to take frequent exerci&s;e in the open air, but to avoid fatigue; and never to go abroad in damp foggy weather, if they can &s;hun it. Women of a full habit ought to u&s;e a &s;pare diet, avoiding &s;trong liquors, and every thing that may tend to heat the body, or increa&s;e the quantity of blood. Their diet &s;hould be of an opening nature, con&s;i&s;ting principally of vegeta|ble &s;ub&s;tances. Every woman with child ought to be kept cheerful and ea&s;y in her mind. All violent pa&s;&s;ions hurt the <HI>foetus,</HI> and endanger an abortion.</P>
<P>WHEN any &s;igns of abortion appear, the woman ought to be laid in bed on a mattre&s;s, with her head low. She &s;hould be kept quiet, and her mind &s;oothed and comforted. She ought not to be kept too warm, nor to take any thing of a heating nature. Her food &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of broths, rice and milk, jellies, or gruels with a very little wine in them.</P>
<P>IF &s;he be able to bear it, &s;he &s;hould lo&s;e, at lea&s;t, half a pound of blood from the arm. Her drink ought to be bar|ley-water &s;harpened with cream of tartar; or &s;he may take half a dram of powdered nitre in a cup of water-gruel, eve|ry five or &s;ix hours. If the woman be &s;eized with a violent loo&s;ene&s;s, &s;he ought to drink the decoction of calcined hart&s;horn prepared. If &s;he be affected with vomiting, let her take frequently one of the &s;aline draughts recommend|ed page 143.</P>
<P>SANGUINE robu&s;t women, who are liable to mi&s;carry at a certain time of pregnancy, ought always to be bled a few days before that period arrives. By this means, and ob&s;er|ving the regimen above pre&s;cribed, they may often e&s;cape that misfortune.</P>
<P>THO' we recommend due care for preventing abortion, we would not be under&s;tood as re&s;training pregnant women from their u&s;ual exerci&s;es. This would operate the quite contrary way. Want of exerci&s;e not only relaxes the body, but induces a plethora, or too great a fulne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els, which are the two principal cau&s;es of abortion.</P>

<HEAD>OF CHILDBIRTH.</HEAD>
<P>MANY di&s;ea&s;es proceed from the want of due care in child-bed. The more hardy part of the &s;ex are apt to de&s;pi&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary precautions after delivery. They think, when the labour-pains are ended, the danger is over; but in truth it may only then be &s;aid to be begun. Nature if left to her&s;elf, will &s;eldom fail to expel the <HI>foetus;</HI> but proper care and management are certainly nece&s;&s;ary for the recove|ry of the mother. No doubt, mi&s;chief may be done by too much as well as by too little care. Hence it is that females who have the greate&s;t number of attendants in child-bed, generally recover wor&s;t. But this is not peculiar to the &s;tate of child-bed. Exce&s;&s;ive care always defeats its own intention, and is generally more dangerous than none at all.</P>
<P>DURING actual labour, nothing of a heating nature mu&s;t be given. The woman may, now and then, take a little panada, and her drink ought to be toa&s;t and water, or thin groat-gruel. Spirits, wines, cordial-waters, and other things, which are given with a view to &s;trengthen the mo|ther, and promote the birth, for the mo&s;t part tend only to increa&s;e the fever, inflame the womb, and retard the la|bour. Be&s;ides, they endanger the woman afterwards, as they often occa&s;ion violent and mortal haemorrhages, or predi&s;po&s;e her to eruptive and other fevers.</P>
<P>WHEN the labour proves tedious and difficult, to pre|vent inflammations, it will be proper to bleed. An emoli|ent cly&s;ter ought likewi&s;e frequently to be admini&s;tered; and the patient &s;hould &s;it over the &s;teams of warm water. The pa&s;&s;age ought to be gently rubbed with a little &s;oft <HI>pomatum</HI> or fre&s;h butter, and cloths wrung out of warm water ap|plied over the belly. If Nature &s;eems to &s;ink, and the wo|man be greatly exhau&s;ted with fatigue, a draught of gene|rous wine, or &s;ome other cordial, may be given, but not otherwi&s;e. The&s;e directions are &s;ufficient in natural la|bours, and in all preternatural ca&s;es, a &s;killful &s;urgeon, or man-midwife, ought to be called as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>WE cannot help taking notice of that ridiculous cu&s;tom which &s;till prevails in &s;ome country-places, of collecting a number of women together upon &s;uch occa&s;ions. The&s;e, in&s;tead of being u&s;eful, &s;erve only to crowd the hou&s;e, and ob&s;truct the nece&s;&s;ary attendants. Be&s;ides, they hurt the

patient with their noi&s;e; and often by their untimely and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">pertinent advice, do much mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>AFTER delivery, the woman ought to be kept as quiet and ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible. Her food &s;hould be light and thin; as gruel, panada, &amp;c. and her drink weak and diluting. To this rule however there are &s;ome exceptions. I have known &s;everal hy&s;teric women, who&s;e &s;pirits could not be &s;upported in child-bed without &s;olid food and generous li|quors; to &s;uch a gla&s;s of wine and a bit of chicken mu&s;t be allowed.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES an exce&s;&s;ive haemorrhage or flooding hap|pens after delivery. In this ca&s;e, the patient &s;hould be laid with her head low, have ligatures applied above her knees and elbows, and be in all re&s;pects treated as for an exce&s;&s;ive flux of the <HI>men&s;es.</HI> If the flooding proves violent, linen cloths, which have been wrung out of a mixture of equal parts of vinegar and water, &s;hould be applied to the belly, the loins, and the thighs: The&s;e mu&s;t be changed as they grow dry; and may be di&s;continued as &s;oon as the flooding abates.</P>
<P>IF there be violent pains after delivery, the patient ought to drink plentifully of warm diluting liquors, as tea with a little &s;affron; or an infu&s;ion of camomile flowers; and to take &s;mall broths, with carroway &s;eeds or a bit of orange-peel in them; an ounce of the oil of &s;weet almonds may likewi&s;e be frequently taken in a cup of any of the above li|quors; and if the patient be re&s;tle&s;s, a &s;poonful of the &s;y|rup of poppies may now and then be mixed with a cup of her drink. If &s;he be hot or feveri&s;h, one of the following powders may be taken in a cup of her u&s;ual drink, every five or &s;ix hours. Take of crabs claws prepared half an ounce, purified nitre two drams, &s;affron powdered half a dram; rub them together in a mortar, and divide the whole into eight or nine do&s;es. When the patient is low &s;pirit|ed, or troubled with hy&s;terical complaints, &s;he ought to take frequently twelve or fifteen drops of the tincture of a&s;afoetida in a cup of penny-royal tea.</P>
<P>AN inflammation of the womb is a dangerous and not un|frequent di&s;ea&s;e after delivery. It is known by pains in the lower part of the belly, which are greatly increa&s;ed upon touching; by the ten&s;ion or tightne&s;s of the parts; great weakne&s;s; change of countenance; a con&s;tant fever, with a weak and hard pul&s;e; a &s;light <HI>delirium</HI> or raving; &s;ome|times
<PB N="338" REF="012338_0342_0F88EDFB97A3C5E8">
ince&s;&s;ant vomiting; a hiccup; a di&s;charge of redi&s;h &s;tinking &s;harp water from the womb; an inclination to go to &s;tool; a heat, and &s;ometimes total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine.</P>
<P>THIS mu&s;t be treated like other inflammatory di&s;orders, by bleeding and plentiful dilution. The drink may be thin gruel or barley water; in a cup of which half a dram of nitre may be di&s;&s;olved, and taken three or four times a day. Cly&s;ters of warm water mu&s;t be frequently admini&s;tred; and the belly &s;hould be fomented by cloths wrung out of warm water, or by applying bladders filled with warm milk and water to it.</P>
<P>A SUPPRESSION of the <HI>lochia,</HI> or u&s;ual di&s;charges after de|livery, and the milk-fever, mu&s;t be treated nearly in the &s;ame manner as an inflammation of the womb. In all the&s;e ca&s;es the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">afest cour&s;e is plentiful dilution, gentle evacuati|ons, and fomentations of the parts affected. In the milk-fever, the brea&s;ts may be embrocated with a little warm lin|&s;eed oil, or the leaves of red cabbage may be applied to them. The child &s;hould be often put to the brea&s;t, or it &s;hould be drawn by &s;ome other per&s;on.</P>
<P>NOTHING would tend more to prevent the milk-fever than putting the child early to the brea&s;t. The cu&s;tom of not allowing children to &s;uck for the fir&s;t two or three days, is contrary to Nature and common &s;en&s;e, and is very hurtful both to the mother and child. Every mother who has milk in her brea&s;ts, ought either to &s;uckle her own child, or to have her brea&s;ts frequently drawn, at lea&s;t for the fir&s;t month. This would prevent many of the di&s;ea&s;es which prove fatal to women in child-bed.</P>
<P>WHEN an inflammation happens in the brea&s;t, attended with redne&s;s, hardne&s;s, and other &s;ymptoms of &s;uppuration, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">afe&s;t application is a poultice of bread and milk, &s;oftened with oil or fre&s;h butter. This may be renewed twice a day till the tumour be either di&s;cu&s;&s;ed or brought to &s;uppuration. Afterwards it may be dre&s;&s;ed with yellow ba&s;ilicon, or any other dige&s;tive ointment. The u&s;e of repellants, in this ca&s;e, is very dangerous; they often occa&s;ion fevers, and &s;ometimes cancers: Whereas a &s;uppuration is &s;eldom attend|ed with any danger, and has often the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects.</P>
<P>WHEN the nipples are fretted or chapt, they may be a|nointed with a mixture of oil and bees-wax, or a little gum arabic may be &s;prinkled on them. I have &s;een Hungary-water applied to the nipples have a very good effect. Should

the complaint prove ob&s;tinate, the nur&s;e ought to be purg|ed, which generally removes it.</P>
<P>THE miliary fever is a di&s;ea&s;e very incident to women in child-bed. But as it has been treated of already, we &s;hall take no farther notice of it here than only, with the celebrat|ed Hoffman, to ob&s;erve, that this fever of child-bed women might generally be prevented, if they, during their preg|nancy, were regular in their diet, u&s;ed moderate exerci&s;e, took now and then a gentle laxative of manna, rhubarb, or cream of tartar; not forgetting to bleed in the fir&s;t months, and avoid all &s;harp air. When the labour is coming on, it is not to be ha&s;tened with forcing medicines, which inflame the blood and humours, or put them into unnatural com|motions. Care &s;hould be taken, after the birth, that the natural excretions proceed regularly; and if the pul&s;e be quick, a little nitrous powder &s;hould be given, &amp;c.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall conclude our ob&s;ervations on child-bed women by recommending it to them, above all things, to beware of cold. Poor women, who&s;e circum&s;tances oblige them to quit their bed too &s;oon, often contract di&s;ea&s;es from cold, of which they never recover. It is pity the poor are not better taken care of in this &s;ituation. But the better &s;ort of women run the greate&s;t hazard from being kept too hot. They are generally kept in a &s;ort of bagnio for the fir&s;t eight or ten days, and then dre&s;&s;ed out to &s;ee company. The danger of this conduct mu&s;t be obvious to every one. The &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;tom of obliging women to keep the hou&s;e till they go to church, is likewi&s;e a very common cau&s;e of catching cold. All churches are damp, and mo&s;t of them cold; con&s;equently they are the very wor&s;t places to which a woman can go to make her fir&s;t vi&s;it, after being confined in a warm room for a month. We make this ob&s;ervation from experience, having often had occa&s;ion to attend wo|men who&s;e di&s;orders were the effect of cold caught in this way.</P>

<HEAD>OF BARRENNESS.</HEAD>
<P>BARRENNESS may be very properly reckoned among the di&s;ea&s;es of females, as few married women who have not children enjoy a good &s;tate of health. It may proceed from various cau&s;es; but we &s;hall only take notice of two, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> high living and relaxation. It is very certain that high
<PB N="340" REF="012338_0344_0F88EDFCEA3F1FE0">
living vitiates the humours, and prevents fecundity. We &s;eldom find a barren woman among the labouring poor, while nothing is more common among&s;t the rich and afflu|ent. The inhabitants of every country are prolific in pro|portion to their poverty, and it would be an ea&s;y matter to adduce many in&s;tances of women who, by being reduced to live entirely upon a milk and vegetable diet, have con|ceived and brought forth children, though they never had any before. Would the rich u&s;e the &s;ame &s;ort of food and exerci&s;e as the better &s;ort of pea&s;ants, they would &s;eldom have cau&s;e to envy their poor va&s;&s;als and dependents the ble&s;&s;ing of a numerous and healthy offspring, while they pine in &s;orrow for the want of even a &s;ingle heir to their ex|ten&s;ive dominions.</P>
<P>AFFLUENCE begets indolence, which not only vitiates the humours, but induces a general relaxation of the &s;olids; a &s;tate highly unfavourable to procreation. As we have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, that relaxation is one of the mo&s;t common cau&s;es of barrenne&s;s, we would recommend the following cour&s;e for removing it. Fir&s;t, plenty of exer|ci&s;e in the open air; &s;econdly, the u&s;e of the cold bath; and la&s;tly, a&s;tringent medicines. It is well known, that many women who had been long barren, have, by the u&s;e of the cold bath not only become mothers, but have after|wards enjoyed a much better &s;tate of health. This &s;hould induce all barren women not only to try the cold bath, but to per&s;i&s;t in the u&s;e of it for a long time, otherwi&s;e it cannot be expected to produce any con&s;iderable effects.</P>
<P>THO' a vegetable diet, plenty of exerci&s;e, and the cold bath, are the medicines mo&s;t to be relied upon, we &s;hall mention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, which has &s;ometimes proved effectual, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> common <HI>allum.</HI> About the third or fourth day of the men&s;trual flux the woman mu&s;t take as much powdered al|lum at bed-time, in a cup of wine or negas, as will lie up|on &s;ixpence. This mu&s;t be repeated for three or four nights running. If it has not the de&s;ired effect, it may be taken in the &s;ame manner next time the <HI>men&s;es</HI> return. I have known &s;everal women who always conceived after taking this medicine, and never without it.</P>
<P>THE above ob&s;ervations on diet, air, and exerci&s;e, are applicable to men as well as to women. Dr Chyne avers, that want of children is oftener the fault of the male than of the female, and &s;trongly recommends a milk and veget|able

diet to the former as well as the latter; adding, that his friend Dr Taylor, whom he calls the milk Doctor of Croyden, had brought &s;undry opulent families in his neigh|bourhood, who had continued &s;ome years after marriage without progeny, to have &s;everal fine children, by keeping both parents, for a con&s;iderable time, to a milk and veget|able diet.</P>

<HEAD>RETENTION OF THE MECONIUM.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tomach and bowels of a new-born infant are filled with a blacki&s;h coloured matter of the con&s;i&s;tence of &s;yrup, commonly called the <HI>meconium.</HI> This is generally pa&s;&s;ed &s;oon after the birth by the mere effort of nature, in which ca&s;e it is not nece&s;&s;ary to give the infant any kind of medi|cine.

<HEAD>THE APHTHAE OR THRUSH.</HEAD>
<P>THE aphthae are little whiti&s;h ulcers affecting the whole in&s;ide of the mouth, tongue, throat, and &s;tomach of in|fants. Sometimes they reach through the whole inte&s;tinal
<PB N="342" REF="012338_0346_0F88EDFE69F33260">
canal; in which ca&s;e they are very dangerous, and often put&punc; an end to the infant's life.</P>
<P>IF the aphthae are of a pale colour, pellucid, few in number, &s;oft, &s;uperficial, and fall ea&s;ily off, they are not dangerous; but if opake, yellow, brown, black, thick, or running together, they are bad.</P>
<P>IT is generally thought that the aphthae owe their origin to acid humours; but we have rea&s;on to believe that the&s;e, and &s;everal other eruptive di&s;ea&s;es of infants, are, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to too hot a regimen both of the mother and child. It is a rare thing to find a child who is not do&s;ed with wine, punch, cinnamon waters, or &s;ome other hot and inflaming liquors, almo&s;t as &s;oon as it is born. It is well known that the&s;e will occa&s;ion inflammatory di&s;orders even in adults; is it any wonder then that they &s;hould heat and inflame the tender bodies of infants, and &s;et, as it were, the whole con&s;titution on a blaze?</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t proper medicines for the aphthae are tho&s;e of a cooling and gentle opening nature. Five grains of rhu|barb and a dram of <HI>magne&s;ia alba</HI> may be rubbed together, and divided into &s;ix do&s;es, one of which may be given to the child every five or &s;ix hours. The&s;e powders may ei|ther be given in the child's food or a little of the &s;yrup of pale ro&s;es, and may be repeated as often as is found nece&s;&s;a|ry to keep the belly open.</P>
<P>MANY things have been recommended for gargling the mouth and throat in this di&s;ea&s;e; but it is not ea&s;y to apply the&s;e in very young infants; we would therefore recommend it to the nur&s;e to rub the child's mouth frequently with a little borax and honey; or with the following mixture. Take fine honey an ounce, borax a dram, burnt allum half a dram, ro&s;e-water two drams; mix them together. The&s;e may be applied with the finger, or by means of a bit of &s;oft rag tied to the end of a probe.</P>

<HEAD>OF ACIDITIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE food of children being, for the mo&s;t part, of an ace&s;cent nature, it readily turns four upon the &s;tomach, e|&s;pecially if the body be any how di&s;ordered. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es of children are accompa|nied with evident &s;igns of acidity, as green &s;tools, gripes, &amp;c. The&s;e appearances have induced many to believe,
<PB N="343" REF="012338_0347_0F88EDFF52C26228">
that all the di&s;ea&s;es of children were owing to an acid a|bounding in the &s;tomach and bowels; but whoever con&s;iders the matter attentively, will find, that the&s;e &s;ymptoms of a|cidity are oftener the effect than the cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>NATURE evidently intended, that the food of children &s;hould be ace&s;cent; and until the body be di&s;ordered, or the dige&s;tion hurt, from &s;ome other cau&s;e, we will venture to &s;ay, that the ace&s;cent quality of their food is &s;eldom in|jurious to them. Acidity however is often a &s;ymptom of infantile di&s;orders, and, as it is a very trouble&s;ome one, we &s;hall point out the method of relieving it.</P>
<P>WHEN green &s;tools, gripes, purgings, &amp;c. &s;hew, that the bowels abound with an acid, the child &s;hould have a little &s;mall broth in&s;tead of milk, with light white bread in it; and &s;hould have plenty of exerci&s;e in order to promote the dige&s;tion. It has been cu&s;tomary in this ca&s;e to give the pearl-julep, chalk, crabs eyes, and other te&s;taceous pow|ders. The&s;e indeed, by their ab&s;orbent quality, may cor|rect the acidity; but they are attended with this inconve|niency, that they are apt to lodge in the bowels, and occa|&s;ion a co&s;tivene&s;s, which may prove very hurtful to the in|fant. For this rea&s;on they &s;hould never be given unle&s;s mixed with purgative medicines; as rhubarb, manna, or &s;uch like.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t medicine which we know, in all ca&s;es of aci|dity, is that fine in&s;ipid powder called <HI>magne&s;ia alba.</HI> It purges, and, at the &s;ame time, corrects the acidity; by which means it not only removes the di&s;ea&s;e, but carries off its cau&s;e. It may be given in any kind of food, from ten grains to a tea&s;poonful, according to the age of the pa|tient. I have often known it have good effects when given in the following manner. Take of <HI>magne&s;ia alba</HI> two drams, fine rhubarb in powder half a dram, pepper-mint water and common water, of each two ounces, as much &s;yrup of &s;ugar as will make it agreeable. Shake the bottle, and give the child a table-&s;poonful three or four times a-day.</P>
<P>WHEN an infant is troubled with gripes, it ought not to be do&s;ed with brandy, &s;piceries, and other hot things, but &s;hould have its belly opened with an emolient cly&s;ter, or the medicine mentioned above; and at the &s;ame time a little brandy may be rubbed on its belly with a warm hand before the fire. I have &s;eldom &s;een this fail to ea&s;e the

gripes of infants. It is often more effectual, and always more &s;afe than brandy taken inwardly.</P>

<HEAD>GALLING AND EXCORIATION.</HEAD>
<P>THESE are very trouble&s;ome to children. They happen chiefly about the groin and wrinkles of the neck, under the arms, behind the ears, and in other parts that are moi&s;ten|ed by the &s;weat or urine.</P>
<P>AS the&s;e complaints are, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to want of cleanline&s;s, the mo&s;t effectual means of prevent|ing them are, to wa&s;h the parts frequently with water, to change the linen often, and in a word, to keep the child, in all re&s;pects, thoroughly clean. When this is not &s;uffi|cient, the excoriated parts may be &s;prinkled with ab&s;orbent or drying powders; &s;uch as burnt hart&s;horn, tutty, chalk, crabs claws prepared, &amp;c.

<P>WHEN the parts affected are very &s;ore, and tend to a real ulceration, it will be proper to add a little &s;ugar of lead to the powders; or to anoint the place with a little cam|phorated ointment.

<HEAD>OF ERUPTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>CHILDREN, while on the brea&s;t, are &s;eldom free from e|ruptions of one kind or other. The&s;e however are not often dangerous, and ought never to be &s;topped but with the greate&s;t caution. They tend to free the bodies of infants from hot and acrid humours, which, if retained, might produce fatal di&s;orders.</P>
<P>THE eruptions of children are chiefly owing to the fol|lowing cau&s;es, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> improper food, and neglect of cleanli|ne&s;s. If a child be &s;tuffed at all hours with food that his &s;tomach is not able to dige&s;t, &s;uch food, not being proper|ly a&s;&s;imilated, in&s;tead of nouri&s;hing the body, fills it with gro&s;s humours. The&s;e mu&s;t either break out in form of e|ruptions upon the &s;kin, or remain in the body, and occa&s;i|on fevers and other internal di&s;orders. That neglect of cleanline&s;s is a very general cau&s;e of eruptive di&s;orders, mu&s;t be obvious to every one. The children of the poor, and of all who de&s;pi&s;e cleanline&s;s, are almo&s;t con&s;tantly found to &s;warm with vermin, and are generally covered over with the &s;cab, itch, and other eruptions.</P>
<P>WHEN eruptions are the effect of improper food, or want of cleanline&s;s, a proper attention to the&s;e alone will generally be &s;ufficient to remove them. If this &s;hould not be the ca&s;e, &s;ome drying medicines will be nece&s;&s;ary; but they &s;hould never be applied without the greate&s;t caution. If drying medicines are applied, the belly ought at the &s;ame time to be kept open, and cold is carefully to be avoided. We know no medicine that is more &s;afe for dry|ing up cutaneous eruptions than &s;ulphur, provided it be &s;paringly u&s;ed. A little of the flowers of &s;ulphur may be mixed with the white ointment or hog's lard, and the parts affected frequently touched with it.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t ob&s;tinate of all the eruptions incident to chil|dren are, the <HI>tinea capitis,</HI> or &s;cabbed head, and chilblains. The &s;cabbed head is often exceeding difficult to cure, and &s;ometimes indeed the cure proves wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e. I have frequently known children &s;eized with internal di&s;or|ders, of which they died &s;oon after their &s;cabbed heads had been healed by the application of drying medicines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I SOME time ago &s;aw a very &s;triking in&s;tance of the danger of &s;ub&s;ti|tuting drying medicines in the place of cleanline&s;s and whol&s;ome food.</P>
<P>BEING con&s;ulted for the children of a certain Ho&s;pital in England, who were grievou&s;ly afflicted with &s;cabbed heads, and other cutaneous di&s;orders. I found, upon inquiry, that the children were fed upon po|tatoes, and other crude vegetables, thro' the whole year, and that cleanline&s;s was totally neglected. My advice was to give them more whole&s;ome food, and to keep them thoroughly clean. This advice however was not followed. It was too trouble&s;ome to the &s;ervants, &s;u|perintendents, &amp;c. The bu&s;ine&s;s was to be done by medicine; which was accordingly attempted, but had like to have proved fatal to the whole hou&s;e. Fevers and other internal di&s;orders immediately appeared, and, at length, a putrid dy&s;entery broke out which carried off a great many of the children.</P></NOTE>. The
<PB N="346" REF="012338_0350_0F88EE025CA0BC40">
cure ought always fir&s;t to be attempted by keeping the head very clean, cutting off the hair, combing and bru&s;hing a|way the &s;cabs, &amp;c. If this be not &s;ufficient, let the head be &s;haved once a-week, and wa&s;hed daily with &s;oap and warm water, or with lime-water. Should the&s;e fail, a pla&s;ter of black pitch may be applied, in order to pull out the hair by the roots. And if there be proud fle&s;h, it &s;hould be touched with a bit of blue vitriol, or &s;prinkled with a lit|tle burnt allum. While the&s;e things are doing, the pati|ent mu&s;t be kept to a regular light diet, his belly &s;hould be kept gently open; and cold, as far as po&s;&s;ible, ought to be avoided. To prevent any bad con&s;equences from &s;topping this di&s;charge, it will be proper, e&s;pecially in children of a delicate habit, to make an i&s;&s;ue in the neck or arm, which may be kept open till the patient becomes more &s;trong, and the con&s;titution be &s;omewhat confirmed.</P>
<P>CHILBLAINS commonly attack children in cold weather. They are generally occa&s;ioned by the feet or hands being kept long wet or cold, and afterwards &s;uddenly heated. When children are cold, in&s;tead of taking exerci&s;e to warm them&s;elves gradually, they run to the fire. This occa&s;ions a &s;udden rarefaction of the humours, and an infarction of the ve&s;&s;els; which being often repeated, the ve&s;&s;els are, at la&s;t, over-di&s;tended, and forced to give way.</P>
<P>To prevent it, violent cold and &s;udden heat mu&s;t be e|qually avoided. When the parts begin to look red and &s;well, the patient ought to be purged, and to have the affected parts frequently rubbed with mu&s;tard and brandy, or &s;omething of a warm nature. They ought likewi&s;e to be covered with flannel, and kept warm and dry. Some apply warm a&s;hes betwixt cloths to the &s;welled parts, which frequently help to reduce them. When there is a &s;ore, it

mu&s;t be dre&s;&s;ed with Turner's cerate, or &s;ome other drying ointment; as the ointment of tutty, the pla&s;ter of ceru&s;s, &amp;c. The&s;e &s;ores are indeed trouble&s;ome, but &s;eldom dan|gerous. They generally heal as &s;oon as the warm weather &s;ets in.</P>

<HEAD>OF DIFFICULT BREATHING.</HEAD>
<P>CHILDREN are often &s;eized very &s;uddenly with a great difficulty of breathing, which, if not quickly relieved, proves mortal. This di&s;ea&s;e is known by various names in different parts of the country. In the Ea&s;t coa&s;t of Scot|land it is called the <HI>croup.</HI> On the We&s;t they call it the <HI>chock</HI> or <HI>&s;tuffing.</HI> In &s;ome parts of England, where I have met with it, the good women call it the ri&s;ing of the lights. It &s;eems to be a &s;pecies of <HI>a&s;thma,</HI> attended with very acute and violent &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e generally prevails in cold and wet &s;ea&s;ons. It is mo&s;t common upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and in low mar&s;hy countries. Children of a gro&s;s and lax habit are mo&s;t lia|ble to it. I have &s;ometimes known it hereditary. It gene|rally attacks children in the night, after having been much expo&s;ed to damp cold ea&s;terly winds through the day. Damp hou&s;es, wet feet, thin &s;hoes, wet cloaths, or any thing that ob&s;tructs the per&s;piration, may occa&s;ion this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is attended with a frequent pul&s;e, quick and labori|ous breathing, which is performed with a peculiar kind of croaking noi&s;e that may be heard at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The voice is &s;harp and &s;hrill, and the face is generally much flu&s;hed, tho' &s;ometimes it is of a livid colour.</P>
<P>WHEN a child is &s;eized with the above &s;ymptoms, his feet &s;hould be put into warm water. He ought likewi&s;e to be bled, and to have a laxative cly&s;ter admini&s;tered as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. He &s;hould be made to breathe over the &s;teams of warm water, or an emolient decoction, and emolient ca|tapla&s;ms or fomentations may be applied round his neck. If the &s;ymptoms do not abate, a bli&s;tering pla&s;ter mu&s;t be applied round the neck, or betwixt the &s;houlders, and the child may take frequently a table-&s;poonful of the following julep. Take penny-royal water three ounces, &s;yrup of al|thea and bal&s;amic &s;yrup, each one ounce, mix them toge|ther.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="012338_0352_0F88EE03AA2D64D0">
SOME, in this ca&s;e, recommend a&s;afoetida. It may both be given in form of cly&s;ter, and taken by the mouth. Two drams of a&s;afoetida may be di&s;&s;olved in one ounce of Minde|rerus's &s;pirit, and three ounces of penny-royal water. A table-&s;poonful of this mixture may be given every hour, or oftener if the patient's &s;tomach be able to bear it. If the patient cannot be brought to take this medicine, two drams of the a&s;afoetida may be di&s;&s;olved in a common cly&s;ter, and admini&s;tered every &s;ix or eight hours, till the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e abates.</P>
<P>To prevent a return of this di&s;ea&s;e, all tho&s;e things which occa&s;ion it mu&s;t be carefully avoided; as wet feet, cold, damp ea&s;terly winds, &amp;c. Children who have had frequent returns of this di&s;ea&s;e, or who&s;e con&s;titution &s;eems to predi&s;po&s;e them to it, ought to have their diet properly regulated; all food that is vi&s;cid or hard of dige&s;tion, and all crude, raw, tra&s;hy fruits, are to be avoided. They ought likewi&s;e to have a drain con&s;tantly kept open in &s;ome part of their body, by means of a &s;eton or i&s;&s;ue. I have &s;ometimes known a Burgundy pitch pla&s;ter, worn continually betwixt the &s;houlders for &s;everal years, have a very happy effect in preventing the return of this dreadful di&s;order.</P>

<HEAD>OF TEETHING.</HEAD>
<P>DR Arbuthnot ob&s;erves, that above a tenth part of in|fants die in teething, by &s;ymptoms proceeding from the ir|ritation of the tender nervous parts of the jaws, occa&s;ioning inflammations, fevers, convul&s;ions, gangrenes, &amp;c. The&s;e &s;ymptoms are, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the great deli|cacy and exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility of the nervous &s;y&s;tem at this time of life. But this natural &s;en&s;ibility of the nerves in infancy is too often increa&s;ed by an effeminate education. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that children who are delicately brought up always &s;uffer mo&s;t in teething, and often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">all by convul&s;ive di&s;orders.</P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;ixth or &s;eventh month the teeth generally begin to make their appearance; fir&s;t the <HI>inci&s;ores,</HI> or fore|teeth; next the <HI>canini,</HI> or dog-teeth; and la&s;tly, the <HI>mola|res,</HI> or grinders. About the &s;eventh year there comes a new &s;et; and about the twentieth the two inner grinders, called <HI>dentes &s;apientiae,</HI> the teeth of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="012338_0353_0F88EE0554CED010">
CHILDREN, about the time of cutting their teeth, &s;laver much, and have generally a loo&s;ene&s;s, which is no bad &s;ign; but when the teething is difficult, e&s;pecially when the dog-teeth begin to make their way through the gums, the child has &s;tartings in his &s;leep, tumours of the gums, in|quietude, watchings, gripes, green &s;tools, the thru&s;h, fe|ver, difficult breathing, convul&s;ions, and epilep&s;ies, which often end in death.</P>
<P>DIFFICULT teething is; in all re&s;pects, to be treated as an inflammatory di&s;ea&s;e. If the belly be bound, it mu&s;t be opened either by emollient cly&s;ters or gentle purgatives; as manna, <HI>magne&s;ia alba,</HI> rhubarb, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">enna, &amp;c. The food &s;hould be light, and in &s;mall quantity; the drink plentiful, but weak and diluting, as infu&s;ions of balm, or of the lime-tree flowers; to which about a third or fourth part of milk may be added.</P>
<P>IF the fever be very high, bleeding will be nece&s;&s;ary; but this, in very young children, ought always to be &s;paringly performed. It is an evacuation which they bear the wor&s;t of any. Purging, vomiting, or &s;weating, agree much better with them, and are generally more beneficial. Harris however ob&s;erves, that, when an inflammation appears, the phy&s;ician will labour in vain, if the <HI>cure</HI> be not begun with applying a leech under each ear. If the child be &s;eized with convul&s;ion fits, a bli&s;tering pla&s;ter may be applied betwixt the &s;houlders, or one behind each ear.</P>
<P>DR Sydenham &s;ays, that in fevers occa&s;ioned by teeth|ing, he never could find any remedy &s;o effectual as two, three, or four drops of &s;pirits of hart&s;horn in a &s;poonful of &s;imple water, or other convenient vehicle, given every four hours. The number of do&s;es may be four, five, or &s;ix. I have often pre&s;cribed this medicine with &s;ucce&s;s, but al|ways <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound a larger do&s;e nece&s;&s;ary. It may be given from five drops to fifteen or twenty, according to the age of the child.</P>
<P>IN Scotland, it is very common, when children are cut|ting their teeth, to put a &s;mall Burgundy pitch pla&s;ter be|tween their &s;houlders. This generally ea&s;es the tickling cough which attends teething, and is by no means an u&s;e|le&s;s application. When the teeth are bred with difficulty, it ought to be kept on during the whole time of teething.
<PB N="350" REF="012338_0354_0F88EE05E830A2A0">
It may be enlarged as occa&s;ion requires, and ought to be renewed, at lea&s;t, once a month.</P>
<P>SEVERAL things have been recommended for rubbing the gums, as oils, mucilages, &amp;c.; but from the&s;e much is not to be expected. What we would recommend for this pur|po&s;e is virgin-honey. A little of this may be rubbed on with the finger three or four times a-day. Children are generally at this time di&s;po&s;ed to chew whatever they get into their hands. For this rea&s;on they ought never to be without &s;omewhat that will yield a little to the pre&s;&s;ure of their gums, as a cru&s;t of bread, a wax-candle, a bit of li|quorice-root, or &s;uch like. The&s;e are far more proper than corral, ivory, &s;ilver, or any other impenetrable &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>WITH regard to cutting the gums, we have &s;eldom known it of any real advantage. In ob&s;tinate ca&s;es it ought however to be tried; but as it is generally performed by a &s;urgeon, we &s;hall not &s;pend time in de&s;cribing the operation.</P>
<P>IN order to render the teething le&s;s difficult, parents ought to take care that their childrens food be light and whole&s;ome, and that their nerves be braced by plenty of exerci&s;e without doors, and the u&s;e of the cold bath, &amp;c. Were the&s;e things duly regarded, few children would die of teething.</P>
<P>AS the limits of this performance will not permit us to treat the di&s;ea&s;es of infants at more length, we &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that, if properly nur&s;ed, their di&s;ea&s;es would be very few, and would &s;eldom prove fatal. The nur&s;e may, for the mo&s;t part, do the bu&s;ine&s;s of the phy&s;ician; but the phy&s;ician can never do that of the nur&s;e.</P>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;es of children are far le&s;s complicated than tho&s;e of adults, and con&s;equently much ea&s;ier under|&s;tood; the method of curing them is likewi&s;e very &s;imple, and cannot readily be mi&s;taken. In all the acute di&s;ea&s;es of children, cool air, diluting liquors, and gentle evacuati|ons, are almo&s;t the only things needful; and in their chro|nic di&s;ea&s;es, re&s;torative diet, free air, and proper exerci&s;e, are what the cure mu&s;t chiefly depend upon.</P>

<HEAD>OF WOUNDS.</HEAD>
<P>NO part of medicine has been more mi&s;taken than the treatment and cure of wounds. Mankind in general believe, that certain herbs, ointments, and &s;alves are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
<PB N="351" REF="012338_0355_0F88EE0AAF8B3FD8">
wonderful healing virtues, and imagine that no wound can be cured without the application of them. It is however a fact, that no external application whatever contributes to|wards the cure of a wound, any other way than by keep|ing the parts &s;oft, and defending them from the external air, which may be as effectually done by &s;oft lint as by the mo&s;t pompous applications, while it is exempt from many of the bad con&s;equences attending them.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame ob&s;ervation holds with re&s;pect to internal ap|plications. The&s;e only promote the cure of wounds in &s;o far as they tend to prevent a fever, or to remove any cau&s;e that might ob&s;truct or impede the operations of Nature. It is Nature alone that cures wounds; all that art can do is to remove ob&s;tacles, and to put the parts in &s;uch a condition as is the mo&s;t favourable to Nature's efforts.</P>
<P>WITH this &s;imple view, we &s;hall con&s;ider the treatment of wounds, and endeavour to point out &s;uch &s;teps as ought to be taken to facilitate their cure.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing to be done when any per&s;on has received a wound is to examine whether any foreign body be lodged in it, as wood, &s;tone, iron, lead, gla&s;s, dirt, bits of cloth, &amp;c. The&s;e, if it can be ea&s;ily done, ought to be extract|ed, and the wound cleaned, before any dre&s;&s;ings be appli|ed. When that cannot be effected with &s;afety, on account of the patient's weakne&s;s, or lo&s;s of blood, &amp;c. they mu&s;t be &s;uffered to remain in the wound, and be afterwards ex|tracted when the patient is more able to bear it.</P>
<P>WHEN a wound penetrates into any of the cavities of the body, as the brea&s;t, the bowels, &amp;c. or where any con|&s;iderable blood-ve&s;&s;el is cut, a &s;killful &s;urgeon ought imme|diately to be called, otherwi&s;e the patient may lo&s;e his life. But &s;ometimes the di&s;charge of blood is &s;o great, that if it be not &s;topt, the patient may die even before a &s;urgeon, tho' at no great di&s;tance, can arrive. In this ca&s;e, &s;ome|thing mu&s;t be done by tho&s;e who are pre&s;ent. If the wound be in any of the limbs, the bleeding may generally be &s;topt by applying a tight ligature or bandage round the member a little above the wound. The be&s;t method of doing this is to put a &s;trong broad garter round the part, but &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lack as ea&s;ily to admit a &s;mall piece of &s;tick to be put under it, which mu&s;t be twi&s;ted, in the &s;ame manner as a country|man does a cart-rope to &s;ecure his loading, till the bleeding &s;tops. Whenever this is the ca&s;e, he mu&s;t take care to
<PB N="352" REF="012338_0356_0F88EE0C57A28980">
twi&s;t it no longer, as &s;training too tight might occa&s;ion an inflammation of the parts and endanger a gangrene.</P>
<P>IN parts where this bandage cannot be applied, various other methods may be tried to &s;top the bleeding, as the ap|plication of &s;typtics, a&s;tringents, &amp;c. Cloths dipped in a &s;olution of blue vitriol in water, or the <HI>&s;typtic water</HI> of the Di&s;pen&s;atories, may be applied to the wound. When the&s;e cannot be obtained, &s;trong &s;pirits of wine may be u&s;ed. Some recommend the <HI>Agaric</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr Ti&s;&s;ot, in his <HI>Advice to the people,</HI> gives the following directions for gathering, preparing, and applying the agaric.&mdash;"Gather in au|tumn, while the fine weather la&s;ts, the agaric of the oak, which is a kind of fungus or excre&s;cence i&s;&s;uing from the wood of that tree. It con&s;i&s;ts at fir&s;t of four parts, which pre&s;ent them&s;elves &s;ucce&s;&s;ively: 1. The outward rind or &s;kin, which may be thrown away. 2. The part immediately under this rind, which is the be&s;t of all. This is to be beat well with a hammer, till it becomes &s;oft and very pliable. This is the only preparation it requires, and a &s;lice of it of a proper &s;ize is to be applied directly over the bur&s;ting open blood ve&s;&s;els. It con&s;tringes and brings them clo&s;e together, &s;tops the bleeding, and generally falls off at the end of two days. 3. The third part adhering to the &s;econd may &s;erve to &s;top the bleeding from the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els: and the fourth and la&s;t part may be reduced to powder as conducing to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e.&mdash;That agaric which &s;prings from tho&s;e parts of the tree from whence large boughs have been lopped, is generally reckoned the be&s;t."</NOTE> of the oak as preferable to a|ny of the other &s;typtics; and indeed it de&s;erves con&s;iderable encomiums. It is ea&s;ily obtained, and ought to be kept in every family, in ca&s;e of accidents. A piece of it mu&s;t be laid upon the wound and covered with a good deal of lint, above which a bandage mu&s;t be applied &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight as to keep it firmly on.</P>
<P>THO' &s;pirits, tincture, and hot bal&s;ams may be u&s;ed, in order to &s;top the bleeding when it is exce&s;&s;ive, they are im|proper at other times. They do not promote but retard the cure, and often change a &s;imple wound into an ulcer. People imagine, becau&s;e hot bal&s;ams congeal the blood, and &s;eem, as it were, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">older up the wound, that they therefore heal it; but this is only a deception. They may indeed &s;top the flowing blood, by &s;earing the mouths of the ve&s;&s;els; but, by rendering the parts callous, they ob&s;truct the cure.</P>
<P>IN &s;light wounds which do not penetrate much deeper than the &s;kin, the be&s;t application is a bit of the common black &s;ticking pla&s;ter. This keeps the &s;ides of the wound
<PB N="353" REF="012338_0357_0F88EE0DB92CFA68">
together, and prevents the air from getting into it, which is all that is nece&s;&s;ary. When a wound penetrates deep, it is not &s;afe to keep its lips quite clo&s;e; this keeps in the matter, and is apt to make the wound fe&s;ter. In this ca&s;e the be&s;t way is to fill the wound with &s;oft lint commonly called <HI>caddis.</HI> This however mu&s;t not be &s;tuffed in too hard otherwi&s;e it will do hurt. It may be covered over with a cloth dipped in oil, or &s;pread with the common wax<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE wax pla&s;ter is made by melting together over a &s;low fire, a pound of yellow wax; white re&s;in, and mutton &s;uet, of each half a pound. This not only &s;upplies the place of melilot pla&s;ter, formerly &s;o much in vogue, but makes a very proper application to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light wounds, and to large ones after they are nearly heal.</NOTE> pla&s;|&s;ter; and the whole mu&s;t be kept on by a proper bandage.</P>

IF the wound be large, and there is rea&s;on to fear an in|flammation, the patient mu&s;t be kept on a very low diet.

But when the patient has been greatly weakened by lo&s;s of blood from the wound, it will be dangerous to bleed him, even tho' a fever &s;hould en&s;ue. Nature &s;hould never be too far exhau&s;ted.

<P>BRUISES are generally productive of wor&s;e con&s;equence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> than wounds. The danger from them does not appear immediately, by which means it often happens that they are neglected till pa&s;t cure.

<P>WHEN a brui&s;e is very violent, the patient ought imme|diately to be bled, and put upon a proper regimen.

The brui&s;ed part mu&s;t be bathed with vinegar and water, as directed above; and a poultice made by boiling crumbs of bread, elder flowers, and camomile flowers, in equal quantities of vinegar and water, applied to it. This poultice is peculiarly proper when a wound is joined to the brui&s;e. It may be renewed two or three times a-day.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="012338_0360_0F88EE0FACC61110">
As the &s;tructure of the ve&s;&s;els is totally de&s;troyed by a violent brui&s;e, there often en&s;ues a great lo&s;s of &s;ub&s;tance, which produces an ulcerous &s;ore very difficult to cure. If the bone be affected, the &s;ore will not heal before an exfo|liation takes place, that is, before the di&s;ea&s;ed part of the bone &s;eparates, and comes out through the wound. This is often a very &s;low operation, and may even require &s;everal years to be compleated. Hence it happens, that the&s;e &s;ores are frequently mi&s;taken for the King's evil, and treated as &s;uch, though, in fact, they proceed &s;olely from the injury which the &s;olid parts received from the blow.</P>
<P>PATIENTS in this &s;ituation are pe&s;tered with different ad|vices. Every per&s;on who &s;ees them propo&s;es a new remedy, till the &s;ore is in a manner, poi&s;oned with various and oppo|&s;ite applications, and, is often at length rendered ab&s;o|lutely incurable. The be&s;t method of managing &s;uch &s;ores is, to take care that the patient's con&s;titution does not &s;uffer by confinement, or improper medicine, and to apply nothing to them but &s;ome &s;imple ointment &s;pread upon &s;oft lint, over which a poultice of bread and milk, with boiled camomile flowers, or the like, may be put to nouri&s;h the part, and keep it &s;oft and warm.

<HEAD>OF DISLOCATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>DISLOCATIONS are generally occa&s;ioned by falls, blows, or the like. They are always dangerous, and &s;ometimes, unle&s;s immediately reduced, they prove fatal. A per&s;on who has the misfortune, by a fall from his hor&s;e, or the like, to di&s;locate his neck, is often left to peri&s;h, while it is in the power of every per&s;on pre&s;ent to do all that is nece&s;|&s;ary for his recovery. But people are &s;eized with a kind of panic upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, and are often &s;o much afraid of doing wrong, that they do nothing at all. This is, in fact, allowing a per&s;on to die for fear of hurting him.</P>
<P>WHEN the neck is di&s;located, or put out of joint, the patient is immediately deprived of all &s;en&s;e and motion; his countenance &s;oon turns bloated and blacki&s;h; his neck &s;wells; and his face is generally turned toward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> one &s;houl|der.

&s;uch a manner, as to be able to lay hold of his head with both his hands, while he makes a re&s;i&s;tance by placing his knees again&s;t the patient's &s;houlders. In this po&s;ition, with one hand under the chin, and the other under the hinder part of the head, he mu&s;t pull with con&s;iderable force, gently twi&s;t|ing it at the &s;ame time, if the face be turned to one &s;ide, till he perceives that the joint is replaced. This is ea&s;ily known from the noi&s;e which bones generally makes upon one ano|ther in the very act of reduction, from the patient's beginning &s;oon after to breathe, and from the head continuing in its proper po&s;ition, &amp;c. This operation, like many others, is ea&s;ier performed than de&s;cribed, and requires only common prudence and &s;ufficient re&s;olution in the operator. I have known in&s;tances of its being happily performed even by women, and frequently by men of no medical education.</P>
<P>THO' di&s;locations of the limbs are le&s;s dangerous, they ought neverthele&s;s to be reduced as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. When the operation is long delayed it becomes very difficult, and &s;ometimes even impractible. Be&s;ides, when a bone has been di&s;located for a con&s;iderable time, it can &s;eldom be kept in its place after it has been reduced. A mechanical genius, with a very &s;light notion of the &s;tructure of the human body, will enable any per&s;on to reduce a di&s;located bone.

a man to be u&s;eful in this way. We would however advi&s;e people never to tru&s;t &s;uch operators when an expert and &s;kilful &s;urgeon can be had; but when that is imprac|ticable, they mu&s;t be employed; we &s;hall therefore recom|mend the following hints to their con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>WHEN a large bone is broken, the patient's diet ought, in all re&s;pects to be the &s;ame as that of a per&s;on in a fever. He &s;hould likewi&s;e be kept quiet and cool, and his belly &s;hould be kept gently open either by emollient cly&s;ters, or, if the&s;e cannot be conveniently admini&s;tered, by food that is of an opening quality; as &s;tewed prunes, apples boiled in milk, boiled &s;pinnage, &amp;c. It ought however to be here remarked, that per&s;ons who have been accu&s;tomed to live high, are not all of a &s;udden to be reduced to a very low diet. This might have fatal con&s;equences. There is often a nece&s;&s;ity of indulging bad habits, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, even where the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e might require a different treatment.</P>
<P>IT will generally be nece&s;&s;ary to bleed the patient after a fracture, e&s;pecially if he be young, of a full habit, or has, at the &s;ame time, received any brui&s;e or contu&s;ion. This operation &s;hould be performed as &s;oon after the accident happens as po&s;&s;ible, and if the patient be very feveri&s;h, it may be repeated next day. When &s;everal of the ribs are broken, bleeding is peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IF any of the large bones which &s;upport the weight of the body be broken, the patient mu&s;t keep his bed for &s;everal weeks. It is by no means however nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould lie all this while, as is cu&s;tomary, upon his back. This &s;ituation &s;inks the &s;pirits, galls and frets the patients &s;kin, and renders him very unea&s;y. After the &s;econd week he may be gently rai&s;ed up, and may &s;it &s;everal hours, &s;upport|ed by a bed chair, or the like, which will greatly relieve him. Great care however mu&s;t be taken in rai&s;ing him up, and laying him down, that he exert no &s;trength of his own, otherwi&s;e the action of the mu&s;cles may pull the bone out of its place.</P>
<P>IT is of great importance to keep the patient dry and clean while in this &s;ituation. By neglecting this he is of|ten &s;o galled and excoriated, that he is forced to keep &s;hift|ing places for ea&s;e. I have &s;ometimes known a fractured thigh bone, after it had lain &s;trait for above a fortnight, mi&s;placed by this means, and continue bent for life, in &s;pite of all that could be done.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="012338_0363_0F88EE11E8C4B0F8">
BONE-SETTERS ought carefully to examine whether the bone be not &s;hattered, or broken into a great many pieces. In this ca&s;e it will generally be nece&s;&s;ary to have the limb taken off, otherwi&s;e a gangrene or mortification may en&s;ue. The horror which attends the very idea of an amputation often occa&s;ions its being delayed in &s;uch ca&s;es till too late. I, &s;ome time ago, &s;aw a &s;hocking in&s;tance of this in a ma&s;on, who had the misfortune to fall from the third &s;tory of a hou&s;e. In one of his legs, which had &s;truck a beam, the bones were &s;o &s;hattered and &s;plit near the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ncle, that they felt almo&s;t like a bag of &s;mall &s;tones. Some of their &s;harp points had likewi&s;e penetrated the &s;kin. It was advi&s;ed that the leg &s;hould immediately be taken off; but to this the patient's friends would not con&s;ent. After tak|ing three or four days to con&s;ider of it, the operation was at la&s;t determined upon, and was accordingly performed; but alas, it was in vain! The mortification had already proceeded too far to be &s;topped, and the mi&s;erable patient died in two days.</P>
<P>WHEN a fracture is accompanied with a wound, it mu&s;t be dre&s;&s;ed in all re&s;pects as a common wound.</P>
<P>All that art can do towards the cure of a broken bone, is to lay it perfectly &s;traight, and to keep it quite ea&s;y. All tight bandages do hurt. They had much better be wanting altogether. A great many of the bad con&s;equences which proceed from fractured bones are owing to tight bandages. This is one of the ways in which the exce&s;s of art, or rather the abu&s;e of art, does more mi&s;chief than would be occa&s;i|oned by the want of it. Some of the mo&s;t &s;udden cure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of broken bones which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re ever known, happened when no bandages were applied at all. Some method however mu&s;t be taken to keep the member &s;teady; but this may be done many ways without bracing it with a tight bandage. We are not however again&s;t the u&s;e of bandages altogether. It is only the wrong application of them which we find fault with.</P>
<P>IN fractures of the ribs, where a bandage cannot be pro|perly u&s;ed, an adhe&s;ive pla&s;ter may be applied over the part. The patient in this ca&s;e ought to keep him&s;elf quite ea&s;y, avoiding every thing that may occa&s;ion &s;neezing, laughing, coughing or the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

con&s;tantly di&s;tended, by taking frequently &s;ome light food, and drinking freely of weak watery liquors.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t proper external application for a fracture is <HI>oxycrate,</HI> or a mixture of vinegar and water. The banda|ges &s;hould be wet with this at every dre&s;&s;ing before they be applied, and the part may be frequently &s;prinkled with it.</P>

<HEAD>OF STRAINS.</HEAD>
<P>STRAINS are often attended with wor&s;e con&s;equences than broken bones. The rea&s;on is obvious; they are generally neglected. When a bone is broken, the patient is under a nece&s;&s;ity of keeping it ea&s;y, becau&s;e he cannot make u&s;e of it; but when a joint is only &s;trained, the per&s;on finding he can &s;till make a &s;hift to move it, is &s;orry to lo&s;e his time for &s;o trifling an ailment. In this way he deceives him&s;elf, and converts into an incurable malady what might have been removed by only keeping the part ea&s;y for a few days.</P>
<P>COUNTRY people generally immer&s;e a &s;trained limb in cold water. This is very proper, provided it be done im|mediately, and not kept in too long. But the cu&s;tom of keeping the part immer&s;ed in cold water for many hours together, is certainly dangerous. This relaxes in&s;tead of bracing the part, and is more likely to produce a di&s;ea&s;e than remove one.</P>
<P>WRAPPING a garter, or &s;ome other bandage, pretty tight about the &s;trained part, is likewi&s;e of u&s;e. It helps to re&s;tore the proper tone of the ve&s;&s;els, and prevents the ac|tion of the parts from encrea&s;ing the di&s;ea&s;e. It &s;hould not however be applied too tight. I have frequently known bleeding near the affected part, in violent &s;trains, have a ve|ry good effect.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF ULCERS.</HEAD>
<P>ULCERS may be the con&s;equence of wounds, brui&s;es, or tumours, improperly treated; but they generally proceed from an ill &s;tate of the humours, or what may be called a bad habit of body.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="012338_0365_0F88EE1368935058">
WHEN this is the ca&s;e they ought not to be ha&s;tily dried up, otherwi&s;e it may prove fatal to the patient. Ulcers happen mo&s;t commonly in the decline of life; and per&s;ons who neglect exerci&s;e and live full, are mo&s;t liable to them. They might often be prevented by retrenching &s;ome part of the &s;olid food, or by opening artificial drains, as i&s;&s;ues, &s;etons, or the like.</P>
<P>AN ulcer may be known from a wound by its di&s;charg|ing a thin watery humour, which is often &s;o acrid as to in|flame and corrode the &s;kin; by the hardne&s;s and perpen|dicular &s;ituation of its &s;ides or edges, and by the time of its duration, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IT requires con&s;iderable &s;kill to be able to judge when an ulcer ought to be healed, and when not. In general, all ulcers which proceed from a bad habit of body &s;hould be &s;uffered to continue open at lea&s;t till the con&s;titution be &s;o far changed by proper regimen, or the u&s;e of medicine; that they &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed to heal of their own accord. Ul|cers which are the effect of malignant fevers, or acute di&s;|ea&s;es, may generally be healed with &s;afety after the health has been re&s;tored for &s;ome time. The cure ought not however to be attempted too &s;oon, nor at any time without the u&s;e of purging medicines and a proper regimen. When wounds or brui&s;es have by wrong treatment, degenerated into ulcers, if the con&s;titution be good, they may generally be healed with &s;afety. Whenulcers either accompany chro|nical di&s;ea&s;es, or come in their &s;tead, they mu&s;t be cautiou&s;ly healed. If an ulcer conduces to the patient's health, it ought never to be healed; but if, on the contrary, it wa&s;tes the &s;trength, and con&s;umes the patient by a &s;low <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ever, it &s;hould be healed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>WE would earne&s;tly recommend a &s;trict attention to the&s;e particulars, to all who have the misfortune to labour under this di&s;order, as we have frequently known people throw away their lives by the want of it, while they were extolling and generou&s;ly rewarding tho&s;e whom they ought to have looked upon as their murderers.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t proper regimen for promoting the cure of ulcers, is to avoid all &s;pices, all &s;alted and high &s;ea&s;oned food, all &s;trong liquors, and to le&s;&s;en the u&s;ual quantity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fle&s;h meat. The belly ought to be kept gently open by a diet con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of cooling laxative vegetables and by drinking butter-milk, or whey &s;weetned with honey or the like. The patient ought to be con&s;tantly cheerful, and
<PB N="362" REF="012338_0366_0F88EE1780C2A038">
&s;hould take as much exerci&s;e as he can ea&s;ily bear.</P>
<P>WHEN the bottom and &s;ides of an ulcer &s;eem hard and callous, they may be &s;prinkled twice a day with a little red precipitate of mercury, and afterwards dre&s;&s;ed with the yellow <HI>ba&s;ilicon</HI> ointment. Some chu&s;e to have the edges of the ulcer &s;carified with a lancet; but this operation ought to be performed by a &s;urgeon.</P>
<P>LIME-WATER has frequently been known to have very happy effects in the cure of ob&s;tinate ulcers. It may be u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner as directed for the &s;tone and gravel.</P>
<P>MY late learned and ingenious friend, Dr Whytt, &s;trongly recommends the u&s;e of a &s;olution of the corro&s;ive &s;ublimate of mercury in brandy, for the cure of ob&s;tinate ill conditioned ulcers. I have frequently found this medi|cine, when given according to the Doctor's directions, prove very &s;ucce&s;sful; but it &s;hould never be admini&s;tred without the greate&s;t care. It is made by di&s;&s;olving four grains of the corro&s;ive &s;ublimate of mercury in eight ounces of the be&s;t French brandy. The do&s;e is a table-&s;poonful night and morning; at the &s;ame time wa&s;hing the &s;ore twice or thrice a-day with it. In a letter which I had from the Doctor a little before his death, he informs me, "That he ob&s;erved wa&s;hing the &s;ore thrice a-day with a &s;olution of trible &s;trength was very u&s;eful." This me|dicine ought always to be prepared with the greate&s;t care, and ought never to be admini&s;tred but under the eye of &s;ome per&s;on of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in phy&s;ic.</P>

<HEAD>OF IMPOSTHUMES, OR BOILS.</HEAD>
<P>BOILS are generally the efforts of Nature to expel noxi|ous humours out of the body. Their &s;uppuration ought therefore by all means to be promoted. I do not remember ever to have &s;een one in&s;tance of the con&s;titution being hurt by them, but have often known it greatly mended, e&s;pecially when care was taken to promote a full and free &s;uppuration.</P>
<P>IMPOSTHUMES may proceed from the u&s;e of tra&s;hy fruits, or any other unwhole&s;ome food, from hunger, exce&s;&s;ive labour, or the like. They are attended with acute pain, hardne&s;s, redne&s;s of the part, and all the &s;ymptoms of in|flammation.</P>
<P>BLEEDING and purging will &s;ometimes di&s;cu&s;s the&s;e tu|mours at the beginning; but as &s;oon as it is evident that
<PB N="363" REF="012338_0367_0F88EE1928344068">
matter is collecting, it will be proper to apply a poultice of bread and milk, with a little oil or fre&s;h butter. This may be renewed twice a-day; and if the &s;uppuration goes &s;low|ly on, a raw onion may be cut into &s;mall pieces, or brui&s;ed in a mortar, and &s;pread upon the top of the poultice. This will promote the &s;uppuration more in one day than a &s;imple poultice will do in three or four.</P>
<P>WHEN the boil turns &s;oft, appears of a white or yel|lowi&s;h colour, and is quite full of matter, if it does not break of it&s;elf, it &s;hould be opened with a lancet. This operation is no ways dangerous, and is very little painful, as the &s;kin is very thin and greatly di&s;tended. If no other in&s;trument be at hand, it may be opened with a large needle; but it is always better to make u&s;e of a lancet or &s;ome in&s;trument that will make a pretty large wound, in order that the matter may be di&s;charged freely.</P>
<P>AFTER the impo&s;thume has broke, or been opened, it may be dre&s;&s;ed twice a-day with yellow <HI>ba&s;ilicon</HI> ointment, &s;pread upon lint, or a bit of &s;oft rag. It will &s;till however be proper to keep the poultice applied to it, till &s;uch time as the matter be entirely di&s;charged. After the matter has been di&s;charged, the patient ought to be purged.</P>
<P>WHEN boils return frequently, it &s;hews a bad &s;tate of the humours, and merits particular attention. The patient ought to be peculiarly attentive to his diet, and, if the di&s;|ea&s;e proceeds from any error in it, it &s;hould be changed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Repeated purges are generally nece&s;&s;ary in the ca&s;e; and infu&s;ions of the bitter plants, as water-trefoil, camomile-flowers, &amp;c. ought to be drank freely. Tho&s;e who are able to afford it, &s;hould take a cour&s;e of the purging mineral waters.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF WHITLOWS.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>whitlow</HI> is a painful tumour appearing near the end of a finger, the humour of which is often &s;o &s;harp as to corrode the tendons and nerves, and &s;ometimes even the bone it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THESE tumours &s;ometimes proceed from the puncture of a &s;harp body, as a thorn, a pin, a &s;plinter, or the like. But their mo&s;t general cau&s;es, as was formerly ob&s;erved, are &s;udden changes from cold to heat, or the contrary. Hence the di&s;ea&s;e is very common among milk-maids, e&s;pecially at that &s;ea&s;on of the year when they go a milking in a cold
<PB N="364" REF="012338_0368_0F88EE1A2AB89988">
nipping fro&s;ty morning, and, as &s;oon as they get home, plunge their hands into warm water, or hold them near the fire.</P>
<P>THE pain of a whitlow is commonly &s;o great, as to render the patient exceeding re&s;tle&s;s. It is attended with an inflammation and often with an evident pul&s;ation. When the humour lies deep, the inflammation &s;preads over the whole hand, and &s;ometimes it extends up the arm even to the &s;houlder. The pain, inflammation, and fever have &s;ometimes been &s;o violent, in this ca&s;e, as to prove mortal.</P>
<P>MANY things are recommended for di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the in|flammation; as bleeding, bli&s;tering, the patient, the hold|ing the part in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> vinegar, dipping it frequently in &s;calding-hot water, and &s;uch like. The&s;e may &s;ometimes &s;ucceed at the beginning, but they do no good afterwards. The &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e is to promote the &s;uppuration, by apply|ing catapla&s;ms, or poultices of bread and milk, with boiled camomile flowers. Or, if a more active and ripening poul|tice be nece&s;&s;ary, the white lilly-root, or a little honey may be added; but the&s;e &s;hould not be applied till there be evi|dent &s;igns of a &s;uppuration.</P>
<P>WHEN the inflamation and fever run very high, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to bleed the patient, and to keep him upon a low diet, allowing him to drink freely of diluting liquors.</P>
<P>WHEN the matter is lodged deep, it is not &s;afe to wait till the tumour breaks and di&s;charges it&s;elf. In this ca&s;e the matter mu&s;t be let out by making a deep inci&s;ion, otherwi&s;e it will corrode and de&s;troy the bone. This o|peration &s;hould always be performed by a &s;urgeon if one can be had. I have frequently &s;een one bone of the finger lo&s;t by the matter remaining too long in contact with it. Indeed whenever the inflammation beings very deep, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to &s;ave the bone.</P>
<P>AFTER the tumor has bur&s;t, or been laid open, it may be dre&s;&s;ed with the yellow <HI>ba&s;ilicon</HI> ointment, or &s;ome other dige&s;tive, and a poultice applied over it. If proud fle&s;h ap|pears, it may be kept down by &s;prinkling a little burnt al|lum over it.</P>
<P>IF any &s;ymptoms of a gangrene or mortification appear, as a black, pale or lived colour of the parts, &amp;c. the patient mu&s;t have immediate recour&s;e to the bark, a dram of which mu&s;t be taken every two or three hours. The part mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;carified, and fomented with a &s;trong decoction of the bark, or camomile flowers; to which &s;ome &s;pirit of &s;ea-&s;alt or &s;trong vinegar, may be added.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="012338_0369_0F88EE1AED3C0C30">
As whitlows and mortifications of the extremities are often the effects of violent cold, we would advi&s;e people who have been expo&s;ed to an exce&s;&s;ive degree of it, if their hands or feet are greatly benumbed, to wa&s;h them in cold water, or rub them, for &s;ome time with &s;now, and to keep at a di&s;tance from the fire. This would not only prevent whitlows, but is the only method of re&s;toring frozen limbs, and of pre|venting a mortification from extreme cold.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF RUPTURES.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e happens mo&s;t frequently to children and old people. Men are greatly more liable to it than wo|men, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are naturally of a weak and relaxed habit. In infants it is generally occa&s;ioned by ex|ce&s;&s;ive crying, violent coughing, repeated efforts to vomit, &amp;c. In adults it is commonly the effect of blows, violent exertions of the &s;trength, as leaping, carrying great weights, &amp;c. An oily or very moi&s;t diet, by inducing a general re|laxation of the &s;olids, is commonly thought to predi&s;po&s;e the body to ruptures.</P>
<P>ON the fir&s;t appearance of a rupture in an infant it ought to be laid upon its back, with its head very low. While in this po&s;ture, if the gut does not return of it&s;elf, it may ea|&s;ily be put up by gentle pre&s;&s;ure. After it is returned, a piece of &s;ticking pla&s;ter may be applied over the part, and a proper tru&s;s or bandage mu&s;t be con&s;tantly worn for a con|&s;iderable time. The method of making and applying the&s;e rupture-bandages for children is pretty well known. The child mu&s;t, as far as po&s;&s;ible, be kept from crying, and from all violent motion, till the rupture is quite healed.</P>
<P>IN adults, when the gut has been forced down with great violence, or happens, from any cau&s;e, to be inflamed, it is often very difficult to return it, and &s;ometimes quite impracticable without an operation which it is not our bu|&s;ine&s;s to de&s;cribe. As I have been fortunate enough how|ever always to &s;ucceed in my attempts to return the gut, without having recour&s;e to any other means than what are in the power of every man, I &s;hall very briefly mention the method which I generally pur&s;ue. After the patient has been bled, he mu&s;t be laid upon his back, with his head very low, and his breech rai&s;ed high with pillows. In this &s;ituation flannel-cloths wrung out of a decoction of mallows and camomile-flowers, or, if the&s;e are not at hand,
<PB N="366" REF="012338_0370_0F88EE1BAD6F60D0">
of warm water, mu&s;t be applied for a con&s;iderable time. A cly&s;ter made of this decoction, with a large &s;poonful of but|ter and a little &s;alt, may be afterwards thrown up. If the&s;e &s;hould not prove &s;ucce&s;sful, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to pre&s;|&s;ure. If the tumour be very hard, con&s;iderable force will be nece&s;&s;ary; but it is not force alone which &s;ucceeds here. The operator, at the &s;ame time that he makes a pre&s;&s;ure with the palms of his hand, mu&s;t with his fingers conduct the gut in by the &s;ame aperture thro' which it came out. The manner of doing this can be much ea&s;ier conceived than de&s;cribed. Should all the&s;e endeavours prove ineffec|tual, cly&s;ters of the &s;moke of tobacco mu&s;t be tried. The&s;e have been often known to &s;ucceed where every other me|thod <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed.</P>
<P>AN adult, after the gut has been returned, mu&s;t wear a &s;teel-bandage. It is needle&s;s to de&s;cribe the&s;e, as they are only to be had from the arti&s;ts who make them. They are generally unea&s;y to the wearer for &s;ome time, but by cu&s;tom they become quite ea&s;y. No per&s;on who has had a rupture after he arrived at man's e&s;tate, &s;hould ever be without one of the&s;e bandages.</P>
<P>PERSONS who have a rupture ought carefully to avoid all violent exerci&s;e, carrying great weights, leaping, running, and the like. They &s;hould likewi&s;e avoid windy aliment and &s;trong liquors; and &s;hould carefully guard again&s;t catching cold.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF CASUALTIES.</HEAD>
<P>AS it is often impracticable to obtain even the &s;malle&s;t degree of medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance in many of tho&s;e accidents which endanger life, we &s;hall conclude with a few ob&s;er|vations upon &s;ome of the mo&s;t common and hazardous of them.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t we &s;hall name is <HI>the &s;toppage of &s;ub&s;tances be|tween the mouth and the &s;tomach.</HI> Though accidents of this kind are unavoidable, yet, generally &s;peaking, they are the effect of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. Children have a &s;trong inclination to put every thing in their mouths which they get hold of. This ought to make nur&s;es careful in keeping every thing from them that they can &s;wallow, which would be hurtful. Even adults are far le&s;s careful in this re&s;pect than they ought to be. Nothing &s;hould ever be held in the mouth which it would be dangerous to &s;wallow, as a fit of cough|ing,
<PB N="367" REF="012338_0371_0F88EE1CA7FA2568">
or &s;ome other accident, may force it over. Notwith|&s;tanding the numberle&s;s accidents which are daily occa&s;ion|ed by holding pins in the mouth, many women have their mouths, for the mo&s;t part, full of them through the day; and &s;ome of them even &s;leep with them there all night.</P>
<P>WHEN a pin, or any other &s;harp body is &s;wallowed, it will generally de&s;cend into the &s;tomach, if its head, or blunt end goes foremo&s;t; but if the point goes foremo&s;t, it is apt to &s;top, and when that happens, every effort to force it down will only &s;erve to fix it fa&s;ter in. In this ca&s;e the be&s;t way is to make the patient vomit, either by tickling his throat with a feather, or giving him a vomit. I have fre|quently known pins which had &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uck in the gullet for &s;eve|ral days, brought up by &s;wallowing a bit of tough meat ti|ed to a &s;trong thread, and drawing it quickly up again.</P>
<P>ALL hard or &s;harp &s;ub&s;tances, which might hurt or wound the bowels, ought, if po&s;&s;ible, to be di&s;charged upwards. Sub&s;tances that will di&s;&s;olve in the &s;tomach, if they cannot be brought up, may be pu&s;hed down. When a mouthful of &s;olid food &s;tops in the gullet, it may often be forced up by giving the per&s;on a blow on the back betwixt the &s;houl|ders. If this &s;hould not &s;ucceed, the throat may be tickled with the finger or a feather. I lately &s;aw a halfpenny, which had &s;tuck fa&s;t in the gullet of a boy about eight years old, thrown up by only thru&s;ting a finger down his throat.</P>
<P>PERSONS who have the misfortune to fall into the water are often given up for dead, when it is certain they might, by proper care, be recovered. The great intention which &s;hould be kept in view is to re&s;tore the natural <HI>warmth</HI> and renew the <HI>circulation</HI> and <HI>breathing.</HI> Tho' cold is by no means the cau&s;e of the per&s;on's death, yet it will prove an effectual ob&s;tacle to his recovery. For this rea&s;on, after &s;tripping him of his wet cloaths, if he had any on when the accident happened, his body mu&s;t be &s;trongly rubbed for a con&s;iderable time with coar&s;e linen cloths as warm as they can be made. As &s;oon as a bed can be got ready, and well heated, he may be laid in it, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ubbing &s;till conti|nued. Warm cloth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould be laid to his &s;tomach and bowels, and hot bricks, or bottles filled with warm water, to the &s;oles of his feet. He &s;hould likewi&s;e be bled. The mo&s;t proper part for this operation is in the jugular vein, both becau&s;e it is mo&s;t likely to bleed, and affords the mo&s;t &s;udden relief to the head.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="012338_0372_0F88EE1D4C9AA770">
IN order to renew the breathing, a &s;trong per&s;on may blow his own breath into the patient's mouth with all the force he can; or, what will &s;ucceed better, the &s;moke of tobacco may be blown into the lungs, by means of a pipe or funnel. I have known a pig drowned and re&s;tored to life, two or three different times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, by blowing air into its mouth with a pair of bellows. It will likewi&s;e be proper to throw up the &s;moke of tobacco into the inte&s;|tines, in form of a cly&s;ter, by means of a proper pipe. Strong volatile &s;alts ought al&s;o to be applied to the no&s;e, or &s;pirits of hart&s;horn, burnt feathers, &amp;c. The no&s;e ought likewi&s;e to be tickled with a feather dipped in volatile &s;pi|rits, and warm &s;pirits of wine &s;hould be rubbed upon the temples, pit of the &s;tomach, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e do not &s;ucceed, the per&s;on may be put into a warm bath, or laid among warm a&s;hes. Dr T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ot menti|ons an in&s;tance of a girl who was re&s;tored to li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, after be|ing taken out of the water to all appearance dead, by lay|ing her naked body upon hot or warm a&s;hes; by covering her with others equally hot; by putting a bonnet round her head, with a &s;tocking round her neck &s;tuffed with the &s;ame, and heaping coverings over all.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame method mu&s;t be pur&s;ued for the recovery of per&s;ons &s;trangled as for tho&s;e who are drowned.&mdash;Such as have the misfortune to be &s;tunned by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">all, a blow, or the like, mu&s;t al&s;o be treated nearly upon the &s;ame princi|ples. Every method mu&s;t be taken to keep up the genial warmth, and to re&s;tore the vital functions. Nor ought we to de&s;pair too &s;oon of &s;ucce&s;s. I have been happy enough to recover a per&s;on who was taken up for dead by a fall from a hor&s;e, after &s;ix hours endeavours, during the great|er part of which time he hardly &s;hewed any &s;igns of life.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more certain than that life, when &s;eeming|ly lo&s;t, might often be re&s;tored by per&s;i&s;ting for a &s;ufficient time in the u&s;e of proper means; and that many of tho&s;e unhappy per&s;ons who peri&s;h by accidents, are really lo&s;t for want of due care. Surely all the laws of religion and hu|manity call upon us to do every thing in our power to &s;ave the lives of our fellow-men. Who would not chu&s;e to be the happy in&s;trument of pre&s;erving an u&s;eful member of &s;ociety, and perhaps of preventing the ruin of an innocent family?</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO enjoy good health is better than to command the world, &s;ays a celebrated practical philo&s;opher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Evremond.</NOTE>, who under&s;tood the u&s;e and value of life and health better than mo&s;t men; for in exile, with a &s;mall income, and no very good con&s;titution, he cultivated an uncommon length of days into a rational &s;eries of plea&s;ures; and what is much more, an uninterrupted cour&s;e of happine&s;s. But, as far as I can find, he was almo&s;t the only man that did &s;o. The generali|ty of men &s;eem to me not to be&s;tow a thought upon either, till it be too late to reap the benefit of their conviction; &s;o that health, like time, becomes valuable only when it is lo&s;t; and we can no longer think of it but with retro&s;pect and regret.</P>
<P>THAT men in good health, the young and gay in their ca|reer, &s;hould be negligent of it, or abu&s;e it, refu&s;ing to &s;top and li&s;ten to, or take warning from others, is no great won|der; but it is very &s;uprizing that mankind in general &s;hould be mi&s;taken and mi&s;led forever in the &s;ame perpetual round of fruitle&s;s attempts to repair and e&s;tabli&s;h it; not the ignorant vulgar only, but the &s;en&s;ible, the judicious, men of parts and knowledge in other things, in this ca&s;e equally blind, &s;hould pur&s;ue, with the &s;ame vain hope, after repeated di&s;appoint|ments, the thou&s;and and ten thou&s;and idle arts and tricks of medication and quackery.</P>
<P>IT has been of great di&s;&s;ervice, as well as di&s;credit to the art of Phy&s;ic, and every fair practi&s;er of it, that men's expec|tations have been rai&s;ed by the ignorant and pre&s;uming, or the di&s;hone&s;t and artful, to hope for too much from it, more than it ever did, or can do. Re&s;pite and relief may be had in mo&s;t chronic ca&s;es; remedy, I fear, but in very few, if it be expected from art alone. But a &s;kilful and hone&s;t phy&s;ician (unle&s;s he be &s;ent for too late and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed too &s;oon, which is generally the ca&s;e) will employ tho&s;e intervals of relief to introduce the powers of life and nature to act for them&s;elves,
<PB N="iv" REF="012338_0375_0F88EE1F9DFEA278">
and in&s;en&s;ibly withdrawing, all his medicines, and watching carefully over his patient's whole conduct, leave him confirm|ed, from conviction of their nece&s;&s;ity, in &s;uch good and &s;alu|tary habits as cannot fail to e&s;tabli&s;h his health for life.</P>
<P>POSSIBLY, if men were better informed of the real cau&s;es of their di&s;ea&s;es, they might be le&s;s unrea&s;onable in their de|mands, and learn to be contented with pre&s;ent relief, &s;ubmit|ting with patience to that plan of life which alone can lead them to, and pre&s;erve them in, permanent health. With this view of engaging men's attention to their own happine&s;s, and undeceiving them in their vain and groundle&s;s hopes of reme|dy, and diverting them from the delu&s;ions of art to the reali|ties of nature, I have ventured to publi&s;h the following Di&s;&s;er|tation, which I mu&s;t beg the Reader to con&s;ider as, what it really is, a ha&s;ty extract of a much larger work, intended to take in the whole circle of Chronic Di&s;ea&s;es, here comprehended only in their repre&s;entative the Gout. If what I have &s;aid may &s;eem to want farther illu&s;tration, or more demon&s;trative proof, he will look upon it only as a &s;ketch to furni&s;h hints for his own thoughts and reflections, either to improve mine or reject them entirely, as may &s;eem good unto him. If he thinks, from what I have &s;aid here, or in the <HI>brochure</HI> it|&s;elf, that I mean to impeach the practice of phy&s;ic in general; I &s;ay that it is not my intention. I would decry all quacks, from AE&s;culapius to the pre&s;ent, either as ignorant fools, or &s;elf-convicted impo&s;tors, adverti&s;ing daily lies, whether mount|ed on &s;tages, or riding in chariots. But the art of phy&s;ic fair|ly and hone&s;tly practi&s;ed I honour as the fir&s;t of profe&s;&s;ions, comprehending the mo&s;t u&s;eful, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and univer|&s;al knowledge of nature. I think a real Phy&s;ician the mo&s;t liberal of characters upon earth; by which I do not mean every Doctor that goes about taking guineas, but him who will neither flatter the great nor deceive the ignorant, and who would prefer the &s;atisfaction of making one invalid a healthy man, to the wealth of <HI>Radcliff</HI> or the vogue of <HI>Ward.</HI> But there is an evil &s;pirit of quackery gone forth, that has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all orders of men among us. I would lay it, if I could, together with every demon of &s;uper&s;tition and error, and re&s;tore the world to truth and nature.</P>

this matter may be well worth our trouble; the ta&s;k &s;eems to have been left for me, and I will perform it mo&s;t &s;incerely.</P>
<P>I HAVE long had it in my mind to write upon chronic di&s;|ea&s;es in general, in the hope of giving mankind, what mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly they have never yet had, a few rational ideas about them; thinking that, if the true original cau&s;es of them were fully and fairly &s;et forth, men could not be &s;o capitally mi&s;ta|ken to impute them, as they do, to the fal&s;e and imaginary, and therefore apply fal&s;e and imaginary remedies; nor think that the general health of mankind were to be over&s;et by every trifle, and the recovery of it lay hid in a few drops or powders of any kind. Did they better under&s;tand the nature of chro|nic di&s;ea&s;es in general, and whence they proceed, they could not be &s;o unrea&s;onable to think they might live as they li&s;t with impunity, expecting repeated remedy from art; or, did they know any thing o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the nature of medicine, they would find that, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of pain have been relieved, or &s;ickne&s;s cured by it for a time, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of health is a very different thing, depending upon other powers and principles: the fir&s;t may be and often is done by medicine, the other never. That their opinion of medicine is vain and ridiculous mu&s;t ap|pear, I think, very evidently to any one who recollects that the art of phy&s;ic ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> now been practi&s;ed, more or le&s;s regular|ly, above two thou&s;and years; and mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly there is not yet di&s;covered any one certain remedy for any di&s;ea&s;e. Ought not this to make us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat there is no &s;uch thing? How can it be, when different degrees of the very &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es re|quire various means and methods, and the &s;ame thing that in one degree would relieve, or perhaps cure, in another might kill? It is by plan, by regimen, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive intenti|on, that di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t be cured, when they are curable; or relieved and palliated when they are not. The &s;kilful in me|dicine, and learned in nature, know well that health is not to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by medicine; for its effects are but momen|tary, and the frequent repetition of it de&s;tructive to the &s;trong|e&s;t frames; that if it is to be re&s;tored, it mu&s;t be by gently calling forth the powers of the body to act for them&s;elves, in|troducing gradually a little more and more activity, cho&s;en di|et, and, above all, peace of mind, changing intirely that cour&s;e of life which fir&s;t brought on the di&s;ea&s;e: medicine co|operating a little. That this is the truth, all who know any thing of nature or art mu&s;t know: and I may &s;afely take up|on me to &s;ay, that, though I firmly believe health may be re|&s;tored in mo&s;t ca&s;es that are not ab&s;olutely mortal, I am very &s;ure that no invalid was ever made a healthy man by the mere

power of medicine. If this be the ca&s;e, how mu&s;t the initiated, according as their humanity is touched, either laugh at or pi|ty the poor fooli&s;h world, &s;urrendering at di&s;cretion to the mo&s;t ignorant of quacks, pretending to infalliable remedies which are not in nature. But what is &s;till more ridiculous, the pa|tient's them&s;elves are often &s;o a&s;hamed to own they have been deluded, that they favour the cheat, by pretending to relief which they never felt.</P>
<P>I HAVE collected a few materials for this work which I in|tend to put in order, as &s;oon as I can find time and indu&s;try enough to &s;et about it in earne&s;t; and, if I can fini&s;h it to my own &s;atisfaction, perhaps I may &s;ome time or other trouble the world with it. At pre&s;ent I think my&s;elf particularly called upon to &s;ay &s;omething of the gout, as that di&s;ea&s;e was to make a con&s;iderable part of my plan; and, as I &s;ee now &s;o many, and hear of more, who are throwing away, not only their money very fooli&s;hly, but, as I verily believe, the future health of their lives al&s;o, in hopes of a medical cure for it, to &s;hew that &s;uch hopes are chymerical, and contradictory to every idea of true philo&s;ophy and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>I SHALL therefore take a few extracts from this general plan, &s;ufficient to &s;hew the real original cau&s;es of all chronic di&s;ea&s;es; which, though they have been multiplied without end, and numberle&s;s cau&s;es been a&s;&s;igned them, are certainly not many, and their fir&s;t cau&s;es very few. I think they may very fairly be reduced to the&s;e three: Indolence, Intemperance, and Vexation.</P>
<P>FROM one or more of the&s;e three cau&s;es, I have undertaken to prove that all or mo&s;t chronic di&s;ea&s;es are produced; for different di&s;ea&s;es may have the &s;ame original cau&s;e, the diffe|rence proceeding from the various degrees of &s;trength and vi|gor in bodies; &s;o that what would be gout in one, in another might be rheumati&s;m, &s;tone, colic, jaundice, pal&s;y, &amp;c. The gout is manife&s;tly, and I think confe&s;&s;edly, a di&s;ea&s;e of the be&s;t con&s;titution, and may therefore fairly &s;tand as a repre&s;en|tative of all the re&s;t: as &s;uch I &s;hall con&s;ider it for the pre&s;ent, and &s;peak of the&s;e cau&s;es in their order: but it may be nece&s;&s;a|ry to &s;ay a word or two of the gout it&s;elf before we enquire into its cau&s;es.</P>
<P>THE gout is &s;o common a di&s;ea&s;e, that there is &s;carcely a man in the world, whether he has had it or not, but thinks he knows perfectly what it is. So does a cook-maid think &s;he knows what fire is as well as Sir I&s;aac Newton. It may there|fore &s;eem needle&s;s at pre&s;ent to trouble our&s;elves about a defi|nition, to &s;ay what it is: but I will venture to &s;ay what I am

per&s;uaded it is not, though contrary to the general opinion. It is not hereditary, it is not periodical, and it is not incura|ble.</P>
<P>IF it were hereditary, it would be nece&s;&s;arily tran&s;mitted from father to &s;on, and no man who&s;e father had it could po&s;&s;ibly be free from it: but this is not the ca&s;e, there are many in|&s;tances to the contrary: it is therefore not nece&s;&s;arily &s;o; but the father's having it inclines or di&s;po&s;es the Son to it. This is the <HI>cau&s;a pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">egum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">na or praedi&s;ponent</HI> of the learned, which of it&s;elf never produced any effect at all; there mu&s;t be joined the <HI>cau&s;a procatarctica,</HI> or active efficient cau&s;e, that is, our own intemperance or mi&s;taken habit of li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, to produce it; and ac|cordingly, as this operates more or le&s;s, &s;o will the gout be. Our parents undoubtedly give us con&s;titutions &s;imilar to their own, and, if we live in the &s;ame manner they did, we &s;hall very probably be troubled with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es; but this by no means proves them to be hereditary: it is what we do our|&s;elves that will either bring them on, or keep us free.</P>
<P>IF it were hereditary, it would appear in infancy and in wo|men, which in general it does not. I may be told of &s;ome women who have had it. I believe never very young, nor till they had contributed to it them&s;elves; for women, as well as men, may abu&s;e a good con&s;titution. I have heard likewi&s;e of a boy or two out of a million that had it, or &s;omething like it; but the&s;e boys have been &s;uffered to &s;ip wine very early, and been fed and indulged every way mo&s;t unwhole&s;omely.</P>
<P>No di&s;ea&s;es are hereditary but tho&s;e of taint or infection, and maleformation; the gout is none of the&s;e, and therefore is not hereditary.</P>
<P>IF the gout be a di&s;ea&s;e of indige&s;tion, and therefore of our own acquiring, we mu&s;t rea&s;on very ill, or rather not rea&s;on at all, when we &s;ay it is hereditary; for &s;urely no man will &s;ay that indige&s;tion is hereditary, any more than intemperance. There are whole nations of active people knowing no luxury, who for ages have been free from it, but have it now &s;ince the Europeans have brought them wine and &s;pirits.</P>
<P>IF the gout be thought hereditary becau&s;e it is incurable by medicine, the &s;ame may be &s;aid of every other chronic di&s;|ea&s;e, none of which ever are cured by it, I mean, &s;o as not to re|turn again. When was there a man who, having had one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it of rheumati&s;m, &s;tone, colic, &amp;c. however happily relieved by art for a time, had it not again and again, or &s;omething wor&s;e in the place of it; till he became a confirmed invalid, and di|ed long before his time; unle&s;s &s;ome very remarkable altera|tion took place in the cour&s;e of his life to confirm his health?
<PB N="5" REF="012338_0380_0F88EE27500EFA28">
So it is in the gout: a man gets a fit of it, and by ab&s;tinence, patience, time and nature, the crude acrimony producing it is &s;ubdued and exhau&s;ted, and he is relieved for that time; (he might be &s;o much &s;ooner, and very &s;afely too, by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of art, judiciou&s;ly employed) he recovers however, and in a few months is taken again. Why? Not from any thing inherent in his con&s;titution, but becau&s;e he returned to his former habit of life that produced it at fir&s;t, and will forever produce it, while the &s;trength of his body la&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE truth is, we breed it at fir&s;t, we renew it again and a|gain, and bring it on our&s;elves by our own mi&s;takes or faults, which we would fain excu&s;e by throwing them back upon our parents, that our complaints may be more ju&s;tly founded. And as bankrupts, undone by idlene&s;s and extravagance, for ever plead lo&s;&s;es and misfortunes; &s;o do we inheritance to excul|pate our&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT is natural enough for tho&s;e who believe the gout here|ditary to think it al&s;o periodical, as if &s;omething innate and inherent in our con&s;titutions produced it at certain times: but this is a great mi&s;take; for, if it were periodical, it mu&s;t be regularly &s;o. The only periodical di&s;ea&s;e I know is the inter|mittent fever, which, till it be di&s;turbed by the bark or any other febrifuge, is as regular as a good clock. The returns of the gout are always very uncertain, according to the quantity or quality of accumulated indige&s;tion within, and the &s;trength of our bodies.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;hew that the gout is not incurable. If by the cure of the gout be meant the admini&s;tering a pill or a powder or medicine of any kind to do it, I fear the gout is and ever will be incurable. It has been long and often attempted in vain, from the origin of phy&s;ic to this day, from the fir&s;t quack to the pre&s;ent. Indeed there is a mo&s;t glaring ab&s;urdi|ty at fir&s;t &s;ight, that mu&s;t &s;top any man of common &s;en&s;e, who has the lea&s;t in&s;ight into nature, or knowledge of the human frame: for if the gout be the nece&s;&s;ary effect of intemperance, as I hope to &s;hew very evidently that it is, a medicine to cure it mu&s;t be &s;omething that will enable a man to bear the daily intemperance of his future life unhurt by the gout or any o|ther di&s;ea&s;e; that is, &s;omething given now that will take a|way the effect of a future cau&s;e. As well might a medicine be given now to prevent a man's breaking his leg or his neck &s;e|ven years hence. One would think the utmo&s;t that any rati|onal man could expect from medicine was, that it &s;hould have power to relieve and quite remove pre&s;ent di&s;orders, leaving the body free, without pretending to in&s;ure it from further inju|ries.
<PB N="6" REF="012338_0381_0F88EE27AB320B60">
Here lies the error: men think the gout to be &s;omething latent in the body now, which, once well eradicated would ne|ver return; not &s;u&s;pecting it to be no more than each days indi|ge&s;tion accumulated to a certain pitch; that, as long as the vigor of life la&s;ts, always brings on every fit, which once well over, the man has no more gout nor &s;eeds of gout in him than he who never had it; and, if he did not breed it again, mo&s;t certainly would never have it again. A proof of this is, that the gout has often been cured by a milk diet, which, as long as it la&s;ted, has generally kept the patient free. But this me|thod of cure I cannot approve, becau&s;e it relaxes and enervates the man, and does not &s;ufficiently &s;upport the health and vigor of his body.</P>
<P>THOUGH I think the gout incurable by medicine, it is &s;o far from being incurable in its nature, that I am firmly per|&s;uaded it may be more ea&s;ily and more perfectly cured than almo&s;t any other chronic di&s;ea&s;e; and this is another &s;trong argu|ment that proves it not hereditary. My rea&s;on is, that it is confe&s;&s;edly a di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t con&s;titution re|lieving it&s;elf by throwing off har&s;h and bad humours from the vitals and out of the blood upon the extremities, where they do lea&s;t harm to the powers and principles of life and health; and as the&s;e humours can be nothing more than the daily ac|cumulations of indige&s;tion, if a man can live without breeding-con&s;tantly this indige&s;ted acrimony, he may mo&s;t undoubted|ly live free not only from the gout, but every other chronic di&s;ea&s;e al&s;o. And that he may live &s;o, not in a perpetual &s;tate of mortification and &s;elf-denial, but with great ea&s;e and com|fort to him&s;elf, in the true&s;t, mo&s;t philo&s;ophic luxury, I &s;hall endeavour to prove, I hope to the &s;atisfaction of all thinking rea&s;onable men.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that Indolence. Intemperance, and Vexation, are the original cau&s;es of all or mo&s;t of our chronic di&s;ea&s;es: perhaps a few accidents mu&s;t be excepted, to which the &s;trong|e&s;t and healthie&s;t are mo&s;t liable, and the effects of fevers not happily ended; and which I except, to obviate all cavil and di&s;pute with the men of art. I believe, to every con&s;iderate man, who&s;e eyes have been opened &s;o as to give him the lea&s;t in&s;ight into nature, the truth of this propo&s;ition will be &s;o &s;elf-evident, that he mu&s;t in&s;tantly perceived it; and every invalid that will be candid enough to do it, may fairly trace all his complaints up to one or other of the&s;e cau&s;es. But it may re|quite &s;ome explanation to the generality of men, who are &s;o &s;hort-&s;ighted as never to look back or forward far beyond the ken of their no&s;e, and therefore never &s;ee either di&s;tant cau&s;es

An accidental cold or even debauch that happens but &s;eldom can have no &s;uch effect; and men otherwi&s;e healthy, living in good habits, &s;oon get rid of both. It is the con&s;tant cour&s;e of life we lead, what we do, or neglect to do, habitually every day, that if right e&s;tabli&s;hes our health, if wrong, makes us invalids for life.</P>
<P>MEN ignorant of the ways of nature in the production and &s;upport of animals, not knowing what &s;he requires to pre&s;erve them in health and vigour to their utmo&s;t period, have con|ceived very &s;trange and mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly very fal&s;e ideas of di&s;|ea&s;es in general, and &s;eem to think every di&s;ea&s;e a di&s;tinct kind of being or thing, and that there are medicines oppo&s;ed to each that will certainly remove and cure it. This makes them &s;o &s;ollicitous to know the name of their complaint, which once a&s;certained, they think the remedy not far off. Poor men! Is not the gout &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed? But where is the remedy? Certainly not in the precarious &s;kill of pre&s;cribing doctors, or the &s;ecret of ignorant and enterprizing quacks. They fancy too that there is great variety of con&s;titutions, with di&s;ea&s;es unavoidably peculiar to each: that certain times of life mu&s;t produce many, and that it is impo&s;&s;ible to grow old without &s;ickne&s;s of &s;ome kind or other. There is certainly no foundation in nature for any of the&s;e opinions, nor is there any real e&s;&s;ential difference of con&s;titution, but of &s;trong or weak, and this is produced more by habit than nature. The &s;trong by bad habits will become weaker, and by good the weak &s;tronger. But the mo&s;t delicate frames may be as healthy as the &s;tronge&s;t, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that a &s;parrow may be as healthy as an elephant. There is no di&s;ea&s;e nece&s;&s;arily peculiar to any time of life, however the changes into the different &s;ta|ges of it may effect the valetudinary. And it is po&s;&s;ible for men to live to great age without any di&s;ea&s;e at all, for many have lived to upwards of an hundred with uninterrupted health.</P>
<P>NOT from the natural defects of our con&s;titutions therefore, but the abu&s;e of them, proceed all our chronic di&s;ea&s;es. That is, from Indolence, Intemperance, or Vexation.</P>
<P>LET us now proceed to enquire what mu&s;t be the nece&s;&s;ary effects of one or more of the&s;e cau&s;es acting daily upon the bo|dy; whether in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t vigorous frames it mu&s;t not be the gout; in weaker, rheumati&s;m, colic, &s;tone, pal&s;y, &amp;c. or any or all of the nervous and hy&s;terical cla&s;s.</P>

<P>IT &s;eems to have been the de&s;ign of Providence, that all men &s;hould labour, every one for him&s;elf: that &s;ome are rich enough to purcha&s;e the labour of others is a mere accident with regard to individuals, in which the care of Providence appears to be no otherwi&s;e concerned, than having unequally di&s;tributed tho&s;e powers and abilities by which active and fiery &s;pirits ri&s;e uppermo&s;t to pre&s;erve the harmony of &s;ubordina|tion, without which &s;ociety could never exi&s;t. The rich and great have &s;o far forgot this fir&s;t principle of nature, that they renounce all bodily labour as unworthy their condition, and thus &s;acrificing health to indulgence and dignity, they do not enjoy tho&s;e advantages their &s;uperior &s;tations and fortunes give them; but in happine&s;s fall often below the labouring hind. I remember to have &s;een a very ingenious little book upon the origin of evil, in which labour is con&s;idered as a great evil. The agreeable author mu&s;t &s;urely mean when it is exce&s;&s;ive, and urged on to the wearing and wa&s;ting the body. In general labour is the fir&s;t principle of good to mankind; I mean the laborious them&s;elves. Does he mean that it would be better for us all, did the earth &s;pontaneou&s;ly bring forth her fruits in &s;uch abundance that we &s;hould no more labour or con|tend for them than we do for the air, and have nothing to do but ba&s;k in ea&s;e, and riot in enjoyment? If &s;o, I can by no means agree with him; for &s;oon, very &s;oon, in &s;uch a &s;tate of things, there would not be one healthy man upon the earth, and the whole race mu&s;t quickly peri&s;h. Indeed, I am afraid, not|with&s;tanding all our unrea&s;onable and unphilo&s;ophical complain|ings, the utmo&s;t wit of man can not remove the lea&s;t evil out of nature, without taking with it all the good. But begging pardon for this little digre&s;&s;ion, and to come back to my own purpo&s;e, I think he had been nearer the truth, had he put In|dolence in its &s;tead, which is a &s;ource of great evil. Nothing undermines the foundation of all our happine&s;s, the health and vigour of the body, like it, or lays &s;uch a train of di&s;ea&s;es to come.

Now the &s;trength of the heart and arteries alone, in a &s;edentary cour&s;e of life, is by no means &s;ufficient to keep up and perpetuate this motion thro' the&s;e capillaries, but requires the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and joint force of all the mu&s;cles of the body to act by intervals, com|pre&s;s the veins, propel and accelerate the circulation of the whole ma&s;s of blood, in order to force and clear the&s;e pipes, and to triturate, cribate, and purify the fluid pa&s;&s;ing through, forming every particle of it into a perfect globule, which is the form all the atoms of matter mu&s;t take from much agitation. Without this extraordinary occa&s;ional aid, the little ve&s;&s;els would, by their natural ela&s;ticity, clo&s;e up into fibres, or be ob&s;tructed by rough angular particles &s;ticking in them, and &s;topping all pa&s;&s;age. Numberle&s;s evils of the chronic kind, e&s;pecially all nervous di&s;ea&s;es, owe their origin to this cau&s;e a|lone. Accordingly we &s;ee mo&s;t of tho&s;e who have liv'd for any time in a &s;tate of indolence, grow emaciated and pale by the drying up of the&s;e fine ve&s;&s;els; or if they happen to be of a lax habit, having a good appetite, and nothing to vex them, they may be loaded with fat; but they grow pale with|al, many of tho&s;e fine pipes being neverthele&s;s clo&s;ed up; &s;o that they appear bloated, and their fat unwhole&s;ome, having much le&s;s blood in their veins than thinner people. Hence we may learn why the&s;e languid pale per&s;ons upon the lea&s;t moti|on

Unle&s;s this can be done, I will venture to pronounce that there is no &s;uch thing as a la&s;ting cure either for the gout or any o|ther chronic di&s;ea&s;e. yes, Sir, &s;ays a common practitioner, cordials, volatiles, bracers, &s;trengtheners, will do this, will keep up an increa&s;ed circulation. Po&s;&s;ibly they may for a few hours, by doing mi&s;chief for many days: but their action &s;oon &s;ub&s;ides, and the &s;timulus cea&s;es; they mu&s;t therefore be re|peated and repeated for life. Woe be to him that takes them, and to him that leaves them off, unle&s;s it be done with great judgment.

No, art can ever come up to nature in this mo&s;t &s;alutary of all her operations.</P>

In a &s;tate of inactivity the old hu|mours pa&s;s off &s;o &s;lowly, the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration is &s;o in|con&s;iderable, that there is no void to be filled, con&s;equently by degrees the appetite, which is the la&s;t thing that decays, that is, the de&s;ire of &s;upply, mu&s;t daily dimini&s;h, and at la&s;t be totally lo&s;t.

all, by increa&s;ing the general circulation, and forcing off a few of tho&s;e humours that had circulated too long in the body, and were becoming acrid: for the quantity they di&s;charge is &s;o trifling, that there could be no phy&s;iology, nor even com|mon &s;en&s;e, in &s;uppo&s;ing the evacuation to be the benefit pro|cured. By a vomit or purge the di&s;charge is a hundred fold more, but the good obtained not always &s;o great, becau&s;e by the&s;e the humours are indi&s;criminately thrown off, and much more of the new than the old.

<HEAD>Of INTEMPERANCE.</HEAD>
<P>I COME now to &s;peak of Intemperance, for Indolence, blunting all our &s;en&s;ations, naturally leads us to Intempe|rance: we want the whip and &s;pur of luxury to excite our jaded appetites. There is no enduring the perpetual moping languor of indolence: we fly to the &s;timulating &s;en&s;ualities of the table and the bottle, friend provokes friend to exceed and accumulate one evil upon another; a joyous momentary relief is obtained, to be paid for &s;everely &s;oon after: the next morn|ing our horrors increa&s;e, and in this cour&s;e there is no remedy but repetition. Thus whoever is indolent is intemperate al&s;o, and partly from nece&s;&s;ity; and the evils nece&s;&s;arily following both the&s;e cau&s;es often make the rich and great more wretched than the poor, and the balance of happine&s;s is held more e|qually between them; for however other things may be di&s;tri|buted, happine&s;s like water always finds its level among men. I wi&s;h this ob&s;ervation might cure the&s;e of their envy, and teach the others how to enjoy their wealth.</P>
<P>BEFORE I return to my &s;ubject, I fear I mu&s;t make an apo|logy for what I am going to &s;ay, and hope no one will be of|fended when I venture to &s;ay that nine in ten of all the chronic di&s;ea&s;es in the world, particularly the gout, owe their fir&s;t ri&s;e to intemperance. Many a good man, who piques him&s;elf up|on being the mo&s;t &s;ober regular creature alive, and never eats but of one or two plain di&s;hes, as he calls them, nor exceeds his pint of wine at any meal; keeps good hours, and never &s;leeps above eight or nine, may be &s;urpri&s;ed, if not affronted, to have his di&s;ea&s;es imputed to intemperance; which he con|&s;iders as a great crime. And yet he is often ill, &s;ick in his &s;tomach, troubled with indige&s;tion, and crippled by the gout. The ca&s;e is, we judge of temperance and intemperance from our own habits, without any ju&s;t idea of either. What we are u&s;ed to do, and &s;ee others do, we think right, and ne|ver go up to nature for our knowledge. The be&s;t way to ex|plain what I mean by intemperance, may be to enquire what is nature's law of temperance, and to deviate from that mu&s;t be con&s;idered as intemperance. And here I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, that temperance is a thing of which no Engli&s;hman has or can have the lea&s;t idea, if he judges from his own or his neighbours habits. To form &s;ome notion of it he mu&s;t have &s;een other countries, particularly Spain, Portugal or
<PB N="14" REF="012338_0389_0F88EE2DD91EC558">
Italy, and ob&s;erved how men live there. What they call temperance or even tolerable living, with us would be thought downright &s;tarving. In this view temperance is local and comparative; but what I mean is natural temperance not de|pending upon place or cu&s;tom (for I do not mean fa&s;ting or ab&s;tinence, which can never be &s;alutary but after repletion) and we mu&s;t not judge of it from countries where a piece of bad bread and an onion with a draught of water is thought a tolerable meal; nor from our own, where beggars live better than the nobles of &s;ome countries, and where we riot in the choice of plenty native and exotic every day.</P>
<P>To come then to my idea of it, I think there is an ab&s;o|lute, determined temperance, to be mea&s;ured by every man's natural unprovoked appetite, dige&s;tion and con&s;umption, while he continues in a good &s;tate of health, and right habit of life. As long as a man eats and drinks no more than his &s;tomach calls for and will bear without the lea&s;t pain, di&s;|tention, eructation or unea&s;ine&s;s of any kind; nor than his bo|dy con&s;umes and throws off to the la&s;t grain; he may be &s;aid to live in a very prudent well-regulated &s;tate of temperance, that will probably pre&s;erve him in health and &s;pirits to great old age.</P>
<P>THIS is nature's law: and the rever&s;e of it, or indeed any great deviation from it, mu&s;t be intemperance. When we eat without appetite, or urge beyond moderate &s;atiety, pro|voked by incentives of any kind: when we drink without thir&s;t for the &s;ake of the liquor; indeed I cannot allow him to be &s;trictly temperate who drinks any wine or &s;trong liquor at all, unle&s;s it be medicinally, or now and then for the &s;ake of &s;ociety and good humor, but by no means every day.</P>
<P>Now let us compare this &s;imple idea of temperance with the common cour&s;e of mo&s;t men's lives, and ob&s;erve their pro|gre&s;s from health to &s;ickne&s;s. For I fear we &s;hall find but ve|ry few who have any preten&s;ions to real temperance. In ear|ly youth we are in&s;en&s;ibly led into intemperance by the in|dulgence and mi&s;taken fondne&s;s of parents and friends wi&s;hing to make us happy by anticipation. Having thus exhau&s;ted the fir&s;t degrees of luxury before we come to the dominion of our&s;elves, we &s;hould find no plea&s;ure in our liberty did we not advance in new &s;en&s;ations, nor feel our&s;elves free but as we a|bu&s;e it. Thus we go on till &s;ome friendly pain or di&s;ea&s;e bids, or rather forces us to &s;top. But in youth all the parts of our bodies are &s;trong and flexible, and bear the fir&s;t loads of exce&s;s with le&s;s hurt, and throw them off &s;oon by their own natural vigor and action, or with very little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from ar|tificial

evacuation. As we grow older, either by nature in d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> time, or repeated exce&s;&s;es before our time, the body is le&s;s able to free it&s;elf and wants more aid from art. The man however goes on taking daily more than he wants or can po&s;&s;ibly get rid of, he feels him&s;elf replete and oppre&s;s'd, and his appetite failing his &s;pirits &s;ink for want of fre&s;h &s;upply. He has re|cour&s;e to dainties, &s;auces, pickles, provocatives of all &s;orts.

In vain would the phy&s;ician, moved by particular friend&s;hip to the man, or that integrity he owes to all men, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ve him the be&s;t advice in two words, <HI>quaere &s;udando,</HI> &s;eek it by labor. He would be thought a man void of all knowledge and &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion, if he did not immediately, or after a few evacuations, pre|&s;cribe &s;tomachics, bitter &s;picy infu&s;ions in wine or brandy, vitriolic elixirs, bark, &s;teel, &amp;c. By the u&s;e of the&s;e things the &s;tomach, rou&s;ed to a little extraordinary action, frees it|&s;elf, by di&s;charging its crude, au&s;tere, coagulated contents into the bowels, to be thence forwarded into the blood. The man is freed for a time, finds he can eat again, and thinks all well. But this is a &s;hort-liv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d delu&s;ion. If he is robu&s;t, the acrimony floating in the blood will be thrown out, and a fit of gout &s;ucceeds; if le&s;s &s;o, rheumati&s;m or colic, &amp;c. as I have already &s;aid.

<P>I BELIEVE I mu&s;t here explain a little more fully what I mean by provoking the appetite; which I take to be the ge|neral mode of intemperance among men, for cu&s;tom has made all kinds of incentives to exce&s;s &s;o common, that tho&s;e of daily u&s;e, far from being con&s;idered in the cla&s;s of intemperance, are by mo&s;t people thought to be not only &s;alutary but nece&s;|&s;ary; and they never &s;u&s;pect the lea&s;t evil from the common decoraments of the table, &s;alt, pepper, mu&s;tard, vinegar; and yet, however extraordinary it may &s;eem, I will venture to pronounce that exce&s;s in any of the&s;e mu&s;t be doubly prejudi|cial to health; hurtful in them&s;elves by their acrimony, they provoke the appetite beyond natural &s;atiety to receive an op|pre&s;&s;ive load, which the &s;tomach it&s;elf would &s;oon feel, were it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot artificially &s;timulated to di&s;charge it into the blood by wine and &s;trong liquors immediately after.

<P>THESE men may tell me, perhaps, that I have made a mighty fine declamation again&s;t luxury and intemperance; but what is this to the purpo&s;e? they de&s;ire not to be told of their faults, not to hear di&s;agreeable truths which they know already.

IN England all degrees of men are furni&s;h'd with the means of intemperance, and therefore it is no wonder that mo&s;t men are intemperate. If they are le&s;s &s;o in other coun|tries, it is not that they have more virtue, but they want the means: their oppre&s;&s;ive governments, the precarious &s;tate of property, and their &s;uper&s;titious religion, keep them &s;o poor that luxury is not in their power. They have however this advantage from it, that they are much le&s;s afflicted with chro|nic di&s;ea&s;es than we are. I verily believe there are more gouts in England, than in all the re&s;t of Europe: a proof that good living is more univer&s;al. But not to the advocates for this good living do I wi&s;h to addre&s;s my&s;elf; I fear they will be as incorrigible as their &s;uperiors in higher and more refined luxury. But there are &s;ome not intemperate from choice, but example, habit, cu&s;tom, mi&s;take, not knowing their daily diet to be unwhole&s;ome and productive of their di&s;ea&s;es. To the&s;e it may be of &s;ome u&s;e to have the unwhole&s;ome pointed out, and their choice directed to better things. Men of laborious occupations, who work in the open air, can and do bear great exce&s;&s;es and much unwhole&s;ome diet, without much hurt: I never knew a &s;ick or gouty gardener that was not a remarka|ble &s;ot. But men of &s;edentary trades and bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hopkeep|ers of all kinds, feel much &s;ooner and more heavily the ill ef|fects of intemperance or mi&s;taken choice in their meat and drink. Their fir&s;t care therefore ought to be not to add the di&s;ea&s;es of intemperance to tho&s;e of inactivity, but proportion what they take as well in quantity as in quality to their con|&s;umption. But let us &s;ee how well they do this. They all &s;ay they live upon plain things, and never indulge in made di&s;hes; but they will eat heartily of a goo&s;e or duck, with a large quantity of &s;age, onion, pepper and &s;alt, a pig with &s;imilar preparation, and a hare with higher and more compounded &s;ea|&s;oning. Do they ever eat veal without &s;tuffing, or even a leg of mutton without caper-&s;auce? If ever they eat a &s;teak or a chop, if it is &s;ometimes without pepper, I believe it is never without pickles, the wor&s;t of all poi&s;ons. They are &s;urprized that &s;uch meals &s;hould ri&s;e on their &s;tomachs with flatulence, &s;our and bitter hiccups and eructations, which if they did not keep them down with a &s;ufficient quantity of wine or &s;ometimes a dram, they would be troubled with all the time of dige&s;tion. If this method &s;ucceeds &s;o far as to quiet their &s;tomachs for the pre&s;ent, they go on with it, regardle&s;s or ignorant of future and di&s;tant con&s;equences. Thus are the&s;e &s;harp, har&s;h, hot and inflammatory things forced out of the &s;tomach into the blood, before it has had time to dilute and &s;ubdue, or reject
<PB N="19" REF="012338_0394_0F88EE35F50136C0">
them, and the &s;uperfluous load they bring along with them. And thus is laid the foundation of every di&s;ea&s;e, that appears when the&s;e acrid and fiery particles are accumulated in the blood to a certain degree.</P>
<P>THERE are others who&s;e preten&s;ions to plain diet may &s;eem better founded, but who neverthele&s;s eat and are very fond of things unwhole&s;ome, and very unfit for men of &s;edentary lives, &s;uch as &s;alted and &s;moked fle&s;h and fi&s;h of all kinds, hams, tongues, heavy flour puddings, toa&s;ted chee&s;e, &amp;c. all which are of &s;uch hard and indi&s;&s;oluble texture, that they ne|ver di&s;&s;olve well in the &s;tomach of a plowman: the &s;ame &s;alt, &s;ea&s;oning, and &s;moke, which harden and pre&s;erve them from putrefaction before they are eaten, keep them from di&s;&s;olution afterwards, &s;o that they never are dige&s;ted at all; nor is it po&s;&s;ible any good nouri&s;hment &s;hould ever come from them: the &s;alts they contain are indeed melted in the inte&s;tinal juices, and get into the blood, producing, in the be&s;t con&s;titutions, tho&s;e tettery, itchy, or &s;caly eruptions, commonly but very erroneou&s;ly called the &s;curvy, which is quite another kind of di&s;ea&s;e. To this kind of food is owing the bad health of country people, and their children's rickety heads and limbs, and big and hard bellies.</P>
<P>ANOTHER capital mi&s;take many people fall into, who in other re&s;pects are very moderate in their diet, is, that the fle&s;h-meat they eat is always over-done; if boiled too much&punc; the juices are lo&s;t; if over roa&s;ted, fried, or broiled, the ac|tion of the fire, continued too long, changes the mild animal fle&s;h into &s;omething of another quality; the fat is made bitter and rancid, which fire will always do by the &s;weete&s;t oil; and the &s;corched out&s;ide of the lean, dry and acrimonious: the le&s;s therefore all fle&s;h meat undergoes the power of fire, the mild|er and whole&s;omer it is. I do not mean by this to recommend the cu&s;toms of Cannibals or bea&s;ts of prey, that devour ani|mals alive: but it may be ob&s;erved, that the fir&s;t are free from our di&s;ea&s;es, and the other amazingly &s;trong and vigorous. We may learn this from them at lea&s;t, that our meat cannot be the whole&s;omer for being, as &s;ome call it, thoroughly done; and that we &s;hould learn to like it with &s;ome of its red juices un&s;poiled by the fire. Upon this principle the Engli&s;h cookery is to be preferred to the French, who &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew and roa&s;t to rags; and of Engli&s;h cookery broiling mu&s;t be the be&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS leads me to another ob&s;ervation, which perhaps none but phy&s;icians, or tho&s;e who have &s;tudied well the nature of man and his aliments, are able to make. It is this: that man being born to devour mo&s;t of the fruits and animals of the
<PB N="20" REF="012338_0395_0F88EE36AC668420">
earth and water, there ought to be a certain proportion of a|nimal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances in his food; the animal tend|ing &s;pontaneou&s;ly to putrefaction, the vegetable correcting that tendency from going too far: thus from the due mixture of both qualities re&s;ults that neutral property, equally di&s;tant from acid as alcali, that is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to produce good blood. This is &s;o manife&s;t, that whoever will ob&s;erve attentively may &s;ee, whenever either of the&s;e prevails in the body, there is &s;o &s;trong a de&s;ire and longing for things of the other &s;ort, as well as plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation in the palate and &s;to|mach when they are taken, as plainly indicates the natural want. Let a man have lived long upon fle&s;h-meat wholly, he will have a more eager appetite for fruit and vegetables; and if kept too long without them, as is the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who have lived &s;ome time at &s;ea, will grow &s;ick of the real &s;curvy: but if before they are too far gone they reach the land, they will eat the fir&s;t common gra&s;s they can come at with more a|vidity than a hor&s;e or ox, and be perfectly cured by it. In like manner they who have lived long upon vegetables (which regimen is often pre&s;cribed to invalids, e&s;pecially in the gout) will have great craving for fle&s;h meat. We ought to learn from all this to attend diligently to the calls of nature, and ba|lance the mixture with due proportion, not only that our vi|tals may have the le&s;s labour in preparing and making our jui|ces fit for nouri&s;hment, but to prevent the di&s;ea&s;es that are pe|culiar to the predominancy of either. And here I may ob|&s;erve, that the error of mo&s;t men's diet in every cla&s;s of life is, that the acid, crude and au&s;tere almo&s;t always abound; not that they do not eat fle&s;h-meat enough, but they &s;poil it in the preparation and cookery, changing its animal nature into &s;omething wor&s;e than vegetable, taking off entirely all its tendency to di&s;&s;olution and putrefaction by &s;alting, &s;moking, pickling, potting, and pre&s;erving things that in their own &s;imple nature would &s;oon corrupt and di&s;&s;olve; but by the&s;e preparations are hardened and embalmed to keep for years like mummies. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of every kind of made di&s;hes; the &s;alts, &s;pices, hot herbs, and acids with which they are &s;ea&s;oned and compounded, pre&s;erve and harden them to keep for ever: the &s;auces and gravies they &s;wim in have the &s;ame effect as &s;o much pickle. The things we feed upon ought all to be in a peri&s;hable &s;tate, or they will never furni&s;h the materials of good blood; and whatever is harden|ed or &s;ea&s;oned &s;o as to keep long before it be eaten, ought not to be eaten at all, for it will never di&s;&s;olve in the &s;tomach.</P>

whoever they are that take it con&s;tantly, is wine: wine alone produces more di&s;ea&s;es than all the other cau&s;es put to|gether. All men allow that wine taken to exce&s;s is hurtful: they &s;ee the immediate evils that follow; but di&s;tant effects, that require more attentive and deducive ob&s;ervation, very few &s;ee or believe; and, judging from pre&s;ent and agreeable &s;eelings, they &s;ay that a little wine is whole&s;ome, and good for every one, and accordingly take it every day, give it their children, and teach them to like it by debauching their na|tural ta&s;te in the earlie&s;t infancy: thus they come to reli&s;h it by habit, and to be unea&s;y without it like &s;nuff-takers without their tobacco: the want is equally habitual and unnatural in both ca&s;es; for the &s;tomach wants wine no more than the no&s;e does &s;nuff: the immediate &s;en&s;ation of both, after a little u&s;e, is plea&s;ant; but the remote effect of the wine taken con|&s;tantly infinitely more pernicious than of the &s;nuff. This hurts the no&s;e only; the other accumulating a little indige&s;ti|on every day, corrupts all the juices of the body mo&s;t e&s;&s;enti|ally. And though it be often taken with a view to promote dige&s;tion and a&s;&s;i&s;t the operations of the &s;tomach, it manife&s;t|ly does harm to both. In&s;tead of dige&s;ting and di&s;&s;olving, it hardens, and prevents di&s;&s;olution, and curdles and corrupts the milky chyle and fir&s;t juices produced from our food. It warms indeed and &s;timulates the &s;tomach to greater exertion than is natural or nece&s;&s;ary, and thereby enables it to di&s;charge its contents the &s;ooner; whence that agreeable feel of warmth and comfort from its immediate action. But by this extraor|dinary action it forces our food out of the &s;tomach too &s;oon, before it is &s;oftened, di&s;&s;olved, and properly prepared, and &s;ends it into the bowels crude, hard, and au&s;tere, in that ca&s;e to be carried into the blood, there to produce every kind of di&s;ea&s;e. Whatever therefore the advocates for a little wine every day may think, or argue in favour of it, they are mo&s;t undoubtedly in a very great error, and it were certainly much better and &s;afer to drink a bottle and get a little merry once a week, drinking water only or &s;mall beer at all other times: in which interval nature might totally &s;ubdue it and recover intirely. Water is the only liquor nature knows of or has provided for all animals; and whatever nature gives us, we may depend upon it, is be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t for us. Accordingly we &s;ee that when we have committed any exce&s;&s;es or mi&s;takes of any kind, and &s;uffer from them, it is water that relieves.

mineral virtues they contain may make them tolerable to the the &s;tomach in their pa&s;&s;age, but do, as I believe, little more in the body: it is the water that cures. Wine, if it be not one of our own inventions, was given us as a cordial in &s;ick|ne&s;s, wearine&s;s, &s;orrow, and old age, and a mo&s;t &s;alutary charm it would be for mo&s;t of the&s;e evils, did we not exhau&s;t its power by daily u&s;e, and in&s;tead of taking it as &s;uch, drink it up as common draught in youth and health to make us mad. I know this is a very tender topic to touch upon, and too fa|vourite a plea&s;ure to argue again&s;t with any rea&s;onable hope of convincing; mo&s;t men having &s;o indulged them&s;elves in this bewitching habit, that they think they cannot live with|out a little wine every day, and their very exi&s;tence depends upon it; their &s;tomachs require it, nature calls for it, St. Paul advi&s;es it, it mu&s;t be good. Thus men catch at every &s;hadow of an argument that favours their inclinations. St. Paul advi&s;es it as a medicine &s;ometimes, but certainly not e|very day. There is no medicine I know of, that taken eve|ry day, will not either cea&s;e to act entirely, or by acting too much do harm. It will be &s;aid, that many drink wine every day without gout, &s;tone, or any di&s;ea&s;e at all in con&s;equence of it. I believe not many, or I &s;hould know &s;ome of them. If any are &s;o &s;trong as to bear it to old age unhurt, they mu&s;t be very active as well as &s;trong to &s;ubdue it. But I have nothing to &s;ay to the&s;e; my bu&s;ine&s;s is with invalids who complain, and certainly ought not to mea&s;ure con&s;titutions with tho&s;e a|bove their match. The &s;ame arguments will hold equally in favour of every other bad habit. Your no&s;e will want its &s;nuff, your palate its &s;pices; and when the fa&s;hion was for women to be &s;mall wa&s;ted, their galled &s;ides grown callous by the long impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;tays wanted their &s;upport. Nature, like a true female, cries out at the fir&s;t violence, but &s;ubmits in time, is reconciled, and grows fond of the ravi&s;her. But it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of philo&s;ophers to di&s;tingui&s;h carefully be|tween the real wants of nature and the artificial calls of ha|bit; and when we find th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e begin to hurt us, we ought to make the utmo&s;t per&s;evering efforts to break the enchantment of bad cu&s;toms; and though it co&s;t us &s;ome unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations at fir&s;t, we mu&s;t bear them patiently; they will not kill; and a very little time will reconcile us to better modes of life.</P>

I know the rea&s;oning and ar|guments may be much improved and carried farther, and if I had more lei&s;ure I might have attempted it: but I am well a|ware of the un&s;urmountable difficulty of convincing men a|gain&s;t their will by any arguments at all. I chu&s;e therefore at pre&s;ent to invite them to &s;elf-conviction from their own ob&s;er|vations and experience. I flatter my&s;elf they will find it well worth their pains, to rea&s;on a little more than they do with and for them&s;elves; and it will be a great point gained for them, if it turns their mi&s;led opinions from all that imaginary power of re&s;toring health in any of that multitude of ridicu|lous and mo&s;t truly contemptible medicines, that are daily obtruded upon the public, with endle&s;s lies to recommend them, by a &s;et of the poore&s;t, mo&s;t ignorant and paultry rogues in the nation; and engage their attention to their true remedy, a right in&s;titution of life.

Let the &s;ame thing happen after he has made a hear|ty chearful meal, as &s;uddenly the action of his &s;tomach, the whole power of dige&s;tion is cut off totally, as if it were be|come paralytic; and what he has eaten lies a mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive load. Perhaps as the exce&s;s of weakne&s;s is often convul&s;ion, it may be rejected with a violent vomit, or do greater mi&s;|chief. For which rea&s;on &s;uch &s;trokes of di&s;tre&s;s are le&s;s hurt|ful received upon an empty than a full &s;tomach. But why is this? what connexion is there between a piece of bad news and a man's &s;tomach full or empty? whatever the cau&s;e be, the effect is certain and invariably. It is becau&s;e the animal &s;pirits, or the action of the nerves, whatever be the &s;ecret cau&s;e of their power, is called off to &s;upply and &s;upport the tumultuous agitation of the brain, and the &s;tomach, with all its appendages and their &s;ecretions, is left powerle&s;s and para|lytic, and mu&s;t therefore either act convul&s;ively or not at all&punc;</P>
<P>BESIDES this pernicious effect of preventing the natural ac|tion of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, the whole circulation of the blood is di&s;turbed. The contraction and dilatation of the heart, that is, the alternate action by which it opens to re|ceive the blood from the veins, and clo&s;es again to force it out through the arteries; which operation ought to be as true and certain as the vibrations of a pendulum, are broken and uneven: the heart flutters, palpitates; now is overloaded with blood and in danger of &s;uffocation, now recieve none at all: con&s;equently all the &s;ecretions mu&s;t be as irregular, &s;ome of the glands receiving too abundant a

&s;upply that either hurries through, or oppre&s;&s;es and over|powers them, others none at all. Hence that ha&s;ty gu&s;h|ing of pale limpid urine in amazing quantities, tho&s;e &s;udden bur&s;ts&punc; of unmeaning tears: &s;ometimes great dryne&s;s and choaking thir&s;t, &s;ometimes the overflowing of the mouth with water in&s;tead of &s;aliva, and many other nervous and hy&s;terical affections, fits, &s;yncope, epilep&s;y, &amp;c. All which indicate the greate&s;t tumults and perturbations in the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the nervous and vital frame. Many kinds of di&s;ea&s;es have &s;prung from this fountain, of &s;uch unaccountable horrid and terrify|ing appearances, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> formerly they could no otherwi&s;e ac|count for them but by the malefice of &s;orcery, and the imme|diate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of devils.</P>
<P>IN &s;lower, more &s;ilent, but longer continued grief, the ef|fects are &s;imilar, but not &s;o violent. Many little &s;trokes re|peated will do the &s;ame thing in time that a great blow does at once. The function of the &s;tomach will be more gently di&s;turbed and preverted, its juices vitiated, and all its contents will for ever turn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our, bitter or rancid; &s;o that no mild milky chyle, or whol&s;ome material of nouri&s;hment, can ever come into the blood. The patient mu&s;t langui&s;h with cahec|tic inanition, univer&s;al bad habit of body, or pine and wa&s;te with atrophy, the want of nouri&s;hing &s;upply; whence ari&s;e complications of various di&s;ea&s;es &s;ucceeding each other always from bad to wor&s;e: and unle&s;s he can &s;ubdue his anxiety, and re&s;tore peace of mind, he mu&s;t in time &s;ink under it, and die, as it is &s;aid, of a broken heart.</P>
<P>WHOEVER vexes long, mu&s;t certainly want nouri&s;hment; for, be&s;ides the di&s;turbed &s;tate of the &s;tomach, it's broken ap|petite and bad dige&s;tion, from whence what &s;upply there is mu&s;t come not only ill-prepared, but vitiated into the blood; there can be no &s;leep in this &s;tate of mind: the perturbed &s;pirit cannot re&s;t: and it is in &s;leep that all nouri&s;hment is performed, and the finer parts of the body, cha&s;ed and worn with the fatigue of the day, are repaired and re&s;tored to their natural vigour. While we are awake this cannot &s;o well be done; becau&s;e the ince&s;&s;ant action of the body or mind being always partial and irregular, prevents that equal di&s;tribution of the blood to all parts alike, from which each fibre and fila|ment receives that &s;hare or portion that &s;uits it be&s;t. In &s;leep, when it is quiet and natural, all the mu&s;cles of the body, that is, all its active powers that are &s;ubject to our will, are lulled to re&s;t, compo&s;ed and relaxed into a genial temporary kind of pal&s;y, that leaves not the lea&s;t ob&s;truction or hindrance

of the pa&s;&s;age of the blood to every atom. Accordingly the pul&s;e is always &s;lower and more equal, the re&s;piration deeper and more regular, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and the &s;ame degree of vital warmth dif|fu&s;ed alike through every part; &s;o that the extremities are equally warm with the heart.</P>
<P>VEXATION operating in this manner upon the organs of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ge&s;tion and concoction, and di&s;turbing and ob&s;tructing the natural progre&s;s of nutrition, mu&s;t often produce di&s;ea&s;es &s;imilar to tho&s;e of long continued intemperance; it's fir&s;t ef|fect being indige&s;tion with all it's &s;ymptoms, wind, eructation, heart-burn, hiccup, &amp;c. It is no wonder therefore it &s;hould &s;ome|times bring on a fit of the gout, which, as I have &s;aid is mani|fe&s;tly a di&s;ea&s;e of crudity and indige&s;tion; and often the gout in the &s;tomach and bowels. Indeed mo&s;t cold crude coli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s are of this kind. Schirrous concretions will al&s;o be formed in the &s;pleen, liver, glands of the me&s;entery, and throughout the whole &s;y&s;|tem of the belly. Many of the&s;e indurated tumors will appear outwardly, &s;o as to be felt by the hand; the&s;e in time will degenerate into cancers and cancerous ulcerations, and many fatal evils, not the lea&s;t of which, in my opinion, is, that the patient will &s;uffer a long time before he dies.</P>
<P>ALL the pa&s;&s;ions when they are inordinate may have inju|rious effects upon the vital frame: exce&s;&s;ive joy has &s;ometimes given a fatal blow, and &s;udden bur&s;ts of laughter done great mi&s;chiefs, e&s;pecially to delicate or weakly people, who have often been thrown into &s;pa&s;ms, cramps, convul&s;ions, hy&s;teric fits and haemorrhages by them. But as I think the word Vexation comprehends the chief of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions that hurt us mo&s;t, and mean not to make a metaphy&s;ical enquiry about them, it is needle&s;s to be particular upon each. It may &s;uf|fice to have &s;hewn the immediate and remote influence of vex|ation upon the human body.</P>
<P>WHATEVER men may think of their di&s;ea&s;es, their &s;trange &s;ymptoms and appearances, and their unaccountable cau&s;es, the&s;e are the three original great &s;ources of mo&s;t of the chro|nic di&s;ea&s;es of mankind; which I have endeavoured to &s;et forth and explain in &s;o familiar a manner, that I hope I have been perfectly intelligible to every one who will venture to think and judge for him&s;elf. To &s;uch rational people only I addre&s;s my&s;elf; and to enable them to do this the better, I have furni&s;hed the&s;e hints and ob&s;ervations, which may be extended, improved and applied to particular ca&s;es. I want not, nor wi&s;h to obtrude my ideas upon any man, however warranted I may think my&s;elf from the ob&s;ervation and ex|perience

of my whole life: my principal aim has been only to make men &s;top a little in their career, and con&s;ider with them|&s;elves whether it may not be po&s;&s;ible for them to be mi&s;taken, even in that cour&s;e of diet and tho&s;e habits of life which they never &s;u&s;pected. If they are ill, and for any time, there mu&s;t be a more &s;ub&s;tantial cau&s;e for it, than they are in general willing to allow. It is not always catching cold, for we do not catch cold &s;o often as we think we do; and when a heal|thy robu&s;t, per&s;on takes cold, which can happen but rarely, if this be the whole of the di&s;ea&s;e, it cannot la&s;t long. But the truth is, when the crudity, &s;uperfluity and acrimony of an indo|lent, intemperate life have accumulated to &s;uch a degree as to make us &s;ick, then we &s;ay we have taken cold, or complain of a bad con&s;titution, when we have &s;poiled perhaps a very good one; or with Sydenham, that the epedemic con&s;titution of the air has infected us, or that this or that trifle has di&s;agreed. I am fully and firmly per&s;uaded, that whoever will reflect with &s;ome degree of intelligence and &s;anity, be ju&s;t to him&s;elf, and candid with his phy&s;ician, will in general be able to trace his complaints and di&s;ea&s;es up to one or other of the&s;e three cau&s;es. And whoever does this, mu&s;t infallibly &s;ee how vain and idle all his hopes and expectations of la&s;ting remedy and e&s;tabli&s;hed health mu&s;t be from any kind of quack medicines, or indeed the common and too general practice of phy&s;ic, when the whole is re&s;ted upon &s;omething given to &s;wallow; how ina|dequate the means are to the end propo&s;ed and hoped for; how ill vomiting and purging can &s;upply the place of temperance; bleeding bli&s;tering and all artificial evacuation, of activity; cor|dials and opium, of peace of mind. Is not this to fill the body with har&s;h and unwhole&s;ome juices, and then tear it to pieces to get them out again? To make artificial holes and &s;ores in the &s;kin to renew the blood and di&s;charge &s;uperfluities, in&s;tead of employing mu&s;cular motion to rub off and grind down all the acrimony of angular aculeated particles, and make them &s;mooth and round, and ea&s;ily divi&s;ible; and to employ in|toxication and &s;tupefaction to take off the &s;en&s;e of pain, and leave the cau&s;e where it was, or fix it fa&s;ter? Can any re&s;on|able per&s;on hope for health or long life by any of the&s;e un|natural methods, when the&s;e only are employed? Let him look round among his neighbours and acquaintance; and tell me whether, not only all the gouty, but rheumatic, colicky, jaundiced, paralytic, drop&s;ical people he has ever &s;een, are not either always &s;o, or by fits &s;o; and whether tho&s;e return|ing paroxy&s;ms or fits of the&s;e di&s;orders do not always grow

<HEAD>Of the Cure of the Gout and all other Chronic Di&s;ea&s;es, and the Repair of a broken Con&s;titution.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;et forth the real cau&s;es of the gout, and all it's congenial di&s;ea&s;es. I come now to the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part, to admini&s;ter all po&s;&s;ible comfort to tho&s;e whom great pain and long &s;uffering may have made attentive and docile, and willing to take health upon the terms it is po&s;&s;ible to have it. To the young and voluptuous, who are yet in their career, and declare for a &s;hort life and a merry one, I have nothing to &s;ay but this, that a &s;hort life is very &s;eldom a merry one; on the contrary, it is generally made up of a few years of riot|ous plea&s;ure without happine&s;s, to be &s;everely paid for by as many more of pain and &s;ickne&s;s, regret and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;hewn that the gout is not hereditary, not inhe|rent in our con&s;titutions, but produced by the daily accumu|lations of indige&s;ted, un&s;ubdued acrimony and &s;uperfluity, which, when they abound to a certain degree, mu&s;t end either in a fit of the gout, or &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;e, according to the con&s;titution, as long as any vigour is left in the body: for nature will for ever free or endeavour to free it&s;elf, and purge the blood of its impurities by gout, by fever, by pain of one kind or other, that takes off the appetite, and for a time gives re&s;pite, and prevents the pouring in of more and more enemies to di&s;turb it's operation, and make it ineffectual. Thus young people, after a fit of the gout is happily and well gone off, are as free from it, as if they ne|ver had it; and if they would take warning and be careful not to breed it again, mo&s;t certainly would for ever remain
<PB N="30" REF="012338_0405_0F88EE412DA2B958">
free. How ab&s;urd therefore, how ridicou&s;ly ignorant mu&s;t be every attempt to cure the gout <HI>in futuro</HI> by medicine, before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be yet formed, before it has any exi&s;tence! Can &s;uch a medi|cine give &s;upernatural &s;trength, and enable an old man living in indolence to dige&s;t and con&s;ume, or di&s;charge the &s;uper|fluities of his daily intemperance? that is, to give him more vigorous powers than nature gave him at one-and-twenty, or when the gout came fir&s;t upon him. The Duke of Portland's powder promi&s;ed to do &s;omething like this, and mo&s;t certain|ly kept off the gout for two or three years. But what was it? And what did it really do? It was a &s;trong &s;picy bitter taken in &s;ub&s;tance, in a large quantity, for a long time; it's effect was to keep up a con&s;tant fever as long as it was taken; this kept the gouty matter always afloat, and prevented it's fixing any where. But there was no living long with a con|&s;tant fever; accordingly many of tho&s;e who took it died very &s;oon. I my&s;elf ob&s;erved between fifty and &s;ixty of it's advocates, &s;ome my patients, &s;ome my acquaintance or neighbours, who were apparently cured by it; but in le&s;s than &s;ix years time, <HI>omnes ad internecionem cae&s;i,</HI> they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> died to a man.</P>
<P>MANY &s;imilar attempts have been made with other Medi|cines to cure not only the gout, but mo&s;t other chronic di&s;ea&s;es, and with the &s;ame fatal effects. Antimony and Mercury ela|borated into poi&s;ons by chemi&s;try have been admini&s;tred, par|ticulary the &s;olution of &s;ublimate has torn many a &s;tomach to rags, &s;o that it could never bear common food afterwards. The deadly night-&s;hade, and hemlock, and many &s;uch dread|ful poi&s;ons, have been given as alteratives to re&s;tore health. The intention here &s;eems to be, to kill or cure, to rai&s;e a vio|lent agitation or fever in the body, in hopes it may prove &s;trong enough to throw off the di&s;ea&s;e and medicine together. The effect has ever been, notwith&s;tanding a little apparent and de|ceitful relief may have been perceived from the fir&s;t efforts, that it has &s;unk under both loads, and exhau&s;ted by repeated &s;training, much &s;ooner than by the di&s;ea&s;e alone.</P>
<P>CAN any one in his &s;en&s;es &s;uppo&s;e that di&s;ea&s;es a man has been his whole life contracting, and to which he is adding every day by per&s;everance in unwhole&s;ome diet, and bad ha|bits, are to be thus removed by a <HI>coup de main on de baguette?</HI> or that they will not return, be they cured or conjured away ever &s;o often, whil&s;t he continues the &s;ame mode of life that brought them on at fir&s;t?</P>
<P>WHAT then is to be done? how and in what manner are chronic di&s;ea&s;es and cachexies to be cured, and health re&s;tored and e&s;tabli&s;hed? I have already &s;hewn that the cau&s;es of the&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="012338_0406_0F88EE41F17B86B8">
evils are Indolence, Intemperance, and Vexation; and if there be any truth or weight in what I have &s;aid, the remedies are obvious. Activity, Temperance and Peace of Mind. It will be &s;aid, the remedies are obvious, but impractible. Would you bid the feeble cripple, who cannot &s;tand, take up his bed and walk? the man who has lo&s;t all appetite, ab&s;tain? and the &s;leeple&s;s wretch rack'd with pain enjoy peace of mind? No certainly; I am not &s;o ab&s;urd. The&s;e mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by medicine; and if they have not exhau&s;ted all its power already, a little re|&s;pite, a favourable interval may be obtained, that with other artificial aids co-operating, may be greatly improved to their advantage, and if rightly employed they may get on from &s;trength to &s;trength, till they recover into perfect health. But it it is not my de&s;ign at pre&s;ent to expatiate upon that particular kind of medical relief which every chronic ca&s;e may require; it would lead me into too wide a field, and too far from my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, which is to &s;hew that the gout, in mo&s;t of its &s;tages and degrees, may be cured, a pre&s;ent pa|roxy&s;m or fit relieved, its return for ever &s;afely prevented, and the patient e&s;tabli&s;hed in perfect health.</P>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e the ca&s;e of a man from forty to fifty years of age, who has had at lea&s;t twenty fits of gout; by which mo&s;t of his joints have been &s;o clogg'd and ob&s;tructed, as to make walking or any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ind of motion very unea&s;y to him: let him have had it &s;ometimes in his &s;tomach, a little in his head, and often all over him, &s;o as to make him univer&s;ally &s;ick and low-&s;pirited, e&s;pecially before a regular fit has come to relieve him. This I apprehend to be as bad a ca&s;e as we need propo&s;e, and that it will not be expected that every old cripple who&s;e joints are burnt to chalk, and his bones grown together and united by anchilo&s;is, who mu&s;t be carried from his bed to his table and back again, &s;hould be propo&s;ed as an object of medication and cure: and yet even he might per|haps receive &s;ome relief and palliation in pain, if he has any great degree of it, which is not very common in this ca&s;e. Let us therefore &s;uppo&s;e the fir&s;t example.</P>
<P>IF the point be to a&s;&s;uage the violent raging of a pre&s;ent paroxy&s;m; this may be &s;afely done by giving &s;ome &s;oft and &s;lowly-operating laxative, neither hot nor cold, but warm, either in &s;mall do&s;es repeated &s;o as to move the patient once on twice in twenty-four hours, or by a larger do&s;e oftner in le&s;s time, according to the &s;trength and exigency. This may be followed by a few lenient ab&s;orbent correctors of acrimony or even gentle anodynes: proper catapla&s;ms may al&s;o be &s;afely applied to the raging part, which often a&s;&s;uage pain
<PB N="32" REF="012338_0407_0F88EE42AA98A1F0">
&s;urprizingly; with as much mild and &s;pontaneou&s;ly-di&s;&s;olv|ing nouri&s;hment as may keep the &s;pirits from &s;inking too low: but I would wi&s;h them to &s;ink a little, and exhort the patient to bear that lowne&s;s with patience and re&s;ignation, till nature, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;oft and &s;ucculent food, can have time to relieve him. This ea&s;y method of treating a fit of the gout would an&s;wer in any age; and if the patient was young and vigor|ous, and the pain violent, there could be no danger in taking away a little blood. Thus in two or three days time I have often &s;een a &s;evere fit mitigated and made tolerable; and this is a better way of treating it with regard to future con&s;equen|ces, than bearing it with patience and &s;uffering it to take its cour&s;e: for the &s;ooner the joints are relieved from di&s;ten&s;ion and pain, the le&s;s danger there is of their being calcined and utterly de&s;troyed. But in&s;tead of this, the general practice is quite the rever&s;e. Oh! keep up your &s;pirits, they cry; keep it out of your &s;tomach at all events; where, whenever it rages in a di&s;tant part, it is not at all inclined to come. As you cannot eat, you mu&s;t drink the more freely. So they take cordials, &s;trong wines, and rich &s;poon-meats. By urging in this manner, a great fever is rai&s;ed, the pain enraged and prolonged; and a fit, that would have ended &s;pontaneou&s;ly in le&s;s than a week, protracted to a month or &s;ix weeks and when it goes off at la&s;t, leaves &s;uch ob&s;truction and weakne&s;s in the parts, as cripple the man ever after. All this I hope will be fairly and candidly under&s;tood; for there are doubt|le&s;s a great variety of gouty ca&s;es, but no ca&s;e that will not admit of medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance judiciou&s;ly admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t capital point of all, and what is mo&s;tly de&s;ired by all, is to prevent its return, or changing into any other di&s;|ea&s;e, and to e&s;tabli&s;h health. Mo&s;t men would be very well plea&s;ed and happy could this be done by any medical trick or no&s;trum, with full liberty of living as they li&s;t, and indulging every appetite and pa&s;&s;ion without controul. Some poor filly creatures, ignorant of all philo&s;ophy and the nature of cau&s;es and effects, have been led into experiments of this kind by a few artful rogues, very much to the prejudice of their future health, and danger of their lives al&s;o; expecting from medi|cine what it never did or can perform alone, the cure of chro|nic di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>I THINK it needle&s;s here to take any pains to &s;hew the ineffi|cacy of all the common modes of practice, vomiting, purging, bleeding, bli&s;tering, i&s;&s;ues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They have been found inef|fectual not only in the gout, but all other chronic ca&s;es. All &s;en&s;ible practitioners mu&s;t know their effects to be but temporary,
<PB N="33" REF="012338_0408_0F88EE4368306FD8">
and that they are meant and u&s;ed only as means of pre&s;ent relief. Let us &s;ee therefore by what practicable plan or regimen the per&s;on here de&s;cribed, when a fit of the gout is happily ended, may for ever prevent it's return, and &s;o confirm his general health that it &s;hall not again be over&s;et by every &s;light cold or trifling accident.</P>
<P>I HAVE already &s;hewn that a certain degree of activity or bodily motion is nece&s;&s;ary at intervals every day, to rai&s;e the circulation to that pitch, that will keep the fine ve&s;&s;els open and the old blood pure, and al&s;o make new from the fre&s;h juices. If the patient cannot be brought to this, he has no chance of recovering to perfect health. If therefore he can neither walk nor ride at all, he mu&s;t by degrees be brought to do both by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others, which may be given him in the following manner; Let a handy active &s;er|vant or two be employed to rub him all over as he lies in bed with flannels, or flannel gloves, fumigated with gums and &s;pices, which will contribute greatly to brace and &s;trengthen his nerves and fibres, and move his blood without any fatigue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o him&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This may &s;eem but a trifling pre&s;cription to tho&s;e who have never tried it &s;ufficiently, but is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, and its effects are amazing; e&s;pecially to all tho&s;e who are too weak to u&s;e any mu&s;cular motion them&s;elves. A little friction may have little or no effect, but long continued, and repeated often, with fumigated flannels, it will do more to recover health, and &s;upport it afterwards, than mo&s;t other things or methods. It promote; circulation and per&s;piration, opens the pores, forces the fine ve&s;&s;els, &s;trains and purifies the blood, and this without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any internal &s;timulation.

&s;ea&s;ons. But becau&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I have made what enquiries I could upon this capital article from living witne&s;&s;es; for I do not always pin my faith upon books, knowing it to be no uncommon thing for authors, in&s;tead of framing their &s;y&s;tem from ob&s;ervation and experience, to wre&s;t and explain both to &s;upport their opinions. I have been a&s;&s;ured by a phy&s;ician who practi&s;ed above thirty years in Turkey, that from the Danube to the Eu|phrates he never had &s;een a gouty Turk. I have al&s;o been in|formed by &s;ome of our mini&s;ters who had re&s;ided many years in Con|&s;tantinople, that the gout, and other di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;ame cla&s;s, were not uncommon at court; but the courtiers, it &s;eems, were not as good Mahometans as tho&s;e who lived in the country; for they drink wine, drams, liquers of all &s;orts, without re&s;traint.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o been very credibly informed, that the Gentoos or Marra|tas, a people of India living in the mo&s;t temperate &s;implicity, chiefly upon rice, have no &s;uch thing as the gout or indeed any other chronic di&s;ea&s;e among them.</P></NOTE> wine undoubtedly produces nine in ten of all the gouts in the world, wine mu&s;t be avoided, or taken very &s;paringly, and but &s;eldom. How is this to be done? Can a man u&s;ed to it every day, who thinks he cannot live without it, and that his exi&s;tence depends upon it, leave it off &s;afely? If he thinks he mu&s;t die of the experiment doing it all at once, he may do it by degrees, and drink but half the quantity of ye&s;terday till he has brought it to nothing. But the danger of attempting it in this manner is, that it will never be done; and like a procra&s;tinating &s;inner he will forever put off his penitential re&s;olution till to-morrow. If he did it all once, I would be hanged if he died of the at|tempt; he would be unea&s;y for three or four days, that's all. He may change his liquor, and drink a little good porter, and by degrees come to &s;mall beer, the whol&s;ome&s;t and be&s;t of all liquors except good &s;oft water. But I do not mean that this rigorous ab&s;tinence from wine is to la&s;t for life, but only during the conflict with the di&s;ea&s;e. As &s;oon as he has recovered health and &s;trength to u&s;e exerci&s;e enough to &s;ub|due it, he may &s;afely indulge once a week, or perhaps twice, with a pint of wine for the &s;ake of good humour and good company, if they cannot be enjoyed without it; for I would not be &s;uch a churl as to forbid, or even damp, one of the greate&s;t joys of human life.</P>
<P>If any man &s;hould &s;ay it is better to have a little gout than take all the&s;e pains, and &s;ubmit to this di&s;cipline; this is not the alternative: perhaps it may be more eligible to live at large, and have but a little gout now and then, that goes off well, and leaves no trace behind; but this is very &s;eldom the ca&s;e.
<PB N="36" REF="012338_0411_0F88EE469D663308">
The misfortune is, that a little gout mo&s;t commonly comes again and again more &s;everely, till it becomes a great gout, till it cripples the man, and &s;hortens his life at lea&s;t twenty years, embittering all the latter part of it. If any one thinks this de&s;cription of it, which is the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e nine times in ten, preferable to that gradual exertion of his own powers and &s;trictne&s;s of regimen, or rather attention to him|&s;elf with very moderate ab&s;tinence or &s;elf-denial for a year or two, as here recommended; I have no reply to make him, but mu&s;t give him up to his own choice.</P>
<P>The &s;everity of the&s;e efforts and this ab&s;temious care need be continued no longer than the di&s;ea&s;e or the effects of it remain. When by per&s;everance in the practice of them, to|gether with the medical aids here recommended, the patient &s;hall have recovered his &s;tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gth and locomotive powers, he may pre&s;erve and perpetuate them, and his title to longevity, upon the following plan.</P>
<P>HE mu&s;t never lo&s;e &s;ight of the three great principles of health and long life, Activity, Temperance, and Peace of Mind. With the&s;e ever in view, he may eat and drink of every thing the earth produces, but his diet mu&s;t be plain, &s;imple, &s;olid and tender, or in proportion to his con&s;umption; he mu&s;t eat but of one thing or two at mo&s;t at a meal, and this will &s;oon bring him to be &s;atisfied with about half his u&s;ual quantity: for all men eat about twice as much as they ought to do, provoked by variety: he mu&s;t drink but little of any liquor, and never till he has done eating: the drier every man's diet is, the better. No wine oftener than once or twice a week at mo&s;t; and this mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a luxurious indulgence. If he be &s;ometimes led unawares into a debauch, it mu&s;t be expiated by ab&s;tinence and double exerci&s;e the next day, and he may take a little of my magne&s;ia and rhubarb as a good antidote: or if he cannot &s;leep with his unu&s;ual load, he may drink water, and with his finger in his throat throw it up. I have known &s;ome old &s;oldiers by this trick alone, never taking their do&s;e to bed with them, live to kill their acquaintance two or three times over. One moderate meal a day is abundantly &s;ufficient; therefore it is better to omit &s;upper, becau&s;e dinner is not &s;o ea&s;ily avoided. In&s;tead of &s;upper, any good ripe fruit of the &s;ea&s;on would be very &s;alu|tary, preventing co&s;tivene&s;s, and keeping the bowels free and open, and cooling, correcting, and carrying off the heats and crudities of his indige&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="012338_0412_0F88EE47288D9780">
HIS activity need be no more than to per&s;evere in the habit of rubbing all over night and morning for eight or ten mi|nutes, and walking three or four miles every day, or riding ten, or u&s;ing any bodily labor or exerci&s;e equivalent to it. In bad weather I can &s;ee no great evil in throwing a cloak round his &s;houlders and walking even in the rain; the only difficulty is to &s;ummon re&s;olution enough to venture out; and a little u&s;e would take off all danger of catching cold, by hardening and &s;ecuring him again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of it upon that and all other occa&s;ions. If he dares not ri&s;que this, &s;ome &s;uccedaneum mu&s;t be u&s;ed within doors; more e&s;pecially when bad weather continues any time. I recommend it to all men to wa&s;h their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eet every day, the gouty in particular, and not lie a-bed above &s;even hours in &s;ummer, and eight in winter.</P>
<P>WHOEVER thinks there cannot be luxury enough in this cour&s;e of life, I am per&s;uaded will not find more in any other: for good health, with all its natural appetites and &s;en&s;ati|ons in perfect order, is the only true foundation of luxury. And whoever cultivates it upon the fal&s;e principles of culina|ry or medical art, urging to exce&s;s by &s;timulating provocatives of any kind, in&s;tead of plea&s;ure and enjoyment will meet with pain and di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>Some perhaps may be rea&s;onable enough to ob&s;erve and &s;ay, This plan of yours is very &s;imple; there is nothing marvellous in it; no wonderful di&s;covery of any of the latent powers of medicine: but will a regimen &s;o ea&s;y to be complied with as this, cure the gout, &s;tone, drop&s;y, &amp;c? Will it repair broken con&s;titutions and re&s;tore old invalids to health? My an&s;wer is that if I may tru&s;t the experience of my whole life and above all the experience I have had in my own per&s;on, having not only got rid of the gout, of which I have had four &s;evere fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s in my younger days, but al&s;o emerged from the lowe&s;t ebb of life, that a man could po&s;&s;ibly be reduced to by cholic, jaundice, and a complication of complaints, and recovered to perfect health; which I have now uninterruptedly enjoyed above ten years: I &s;ay, if I may rely upon all this, I may with great &s;afety pronounce and promi&s;e that the plan here recommended, a&s;|&s;i&s;ted at fir&s;t with all the collateral aids of medicine peculiar to each ca&s;e, correcting many an untoward concomitant &s;ymptom, pur&s;ued with re&s;olution and patience, will certain|ly procure to others the &s;ame benefits I received from it, and cure every curable di&s;ea&s;e. If this be thought too much to promi&s;e, I beg it may be con&s;idered, that a life of bad habits produces all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e di&s;ea&s;es: nothing therefore &s;o likely as good ones long continued to re&s;tore or pre&s;erve health.</P>

<P>WE are all &s;o much the creatures of habit, which forms and fa&s;hions us to good or ill almo&s;t as much as nature it&s;elf, that we ought to be very attentive and careful that our daily habits may ever tend to the confirmation not the de&s;truction of health. It is not what we do now and then that can injure us greatly, but what we do every day mu&s;t either do us great good or harm; either e&s;tabli&s;hing our health, or fixing our di&s;ea&s;es, for life.</P>
<P>IF, after all, any man &s;hould &s;ay, the&s;e re&s;traints, this care in choo&s;ing what is whol&s;ome, this con&s;tant watching over all we do, would make life &s;o grievous, that health were not worth having upon the&s;e terms; I wi&s;h him to &s;top a little, and con&s;ider them well before he rejects them intirely; and whether there be any better for him. It can do him no great harm to try a month or two; if he does, I flatter my&s;elf he will find that cu&s;tom will take off the greate&s;t part of the grie|vance, and per&s;everence make them not only tolerable but plea&s;ant. If he thinks health may be enjoyed upon ea&s;ier terms, I fear he will be mi&s;erably deceived; for health, like beauty, may be won by our own attention, efforts and a&s;&s;iduities, but cannot be had by purcha&s;e. Whoever thinks to buy either, will have the misfortune to find it not long his own, though he has paid for it.</P>

BUT there may be others whom long &s;uffering has made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re patient and rea&s;onable; the&s;e may be glad to hear that a little health is to be had on any terms; and it may be very comfortable to them to know that there is &s;carcely any &s;tate of weakne&s;s &s;o low, &s;uppo&s;ing the vitals not mortally hurt, from which they may not recover into very de&s;irable health and &s;trength, and by the&s;e means, exerted with per&s;evering patience.

Whatever chronic di&s;ea&s;es will not give way to this &s;y&s;tem of medication, will be found, I greatly fear, too hard for any other.
