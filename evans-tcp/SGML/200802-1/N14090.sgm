<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS not &s;trange that reports various and con|tradictory &s;hould have circulated on &s;o inter|e&s;ting and terribl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;ubject as that of a man's con|&s;igning to the grave him&s;elf and family in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oment of apparent ea&s;e and tranquility. The agitation of mind which mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of being near &s;uch a &s;cene of horror, will &s;ufficiently apologize for not an&s;wering your reque&s;t for the particulars e'er this. Our ignorance of the hi&s;tory of this man at fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t precluded a po&s;&s;ibility of giving you &s;atisfaction on this head. Perhaps no one in this town had more favorable opportunities of obtaining the particulars of his hi&s;tory: y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, could never induce him to men|tion a &s;ingle &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">llable relating to his age, parentage, or early occupation. To have a&s;ked him directly would have been rude when he evidently meant to be &s;ilent on the&s;e &s;ubjects. My conjecture was that he was the natural &s;on of &s;ome gentleman in
<PB N="6" REF="017828_0004_0FB81A2E356C9ED8">
England, and that he had been brought up in or near London, and had been about the Court. Since his decea&s;e have been able to learn from undoubted authority, that he was born in the county of E&s;&s;ex, in a village not far from London. As to his bu&s;i|ne&s;s in youth am &s;till left in the dark, but find he has once mentioned to a gentleman, &s;ome little inci|dents which happened to him while in company with his father, and that he very early became acquainted with a club in London who were Dei&s;ts, where 'tis probable he received the fir&s;t rudiments in tho&s;e prin|ciples. While in England, where he left a mother and &s;i&s;ter, he had a fair character for integrity and hone&s;ty. In the year 1755 he went out to the I&s;land of Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">adoes, in the family of Charles Pinfold, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Governor of that I&s;land, where he tarried &s;ix years, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> returned to England, purcha&s;ed &s;ome merchan|dize, and from thence came to New-York in the year 1762, and immediately removed to Stratford in this State, from thence to Darby, and then to Fairfield, where he married &amp; dwelt &s;ome years.&mdash;By this time he had acquired about twelve hundred pounds property, with which he removed to this town, about ten years &s;ince, where he re&s;ided until his death. His bu&s;ine&s;s was that of retailing, he formerly credited his goods, but &s;ince his re&s;idence in this town he has refu&s;ed to give any credit, intending to keep his property with|in his own reach, believing it always &s;ecure while his eye was upon it. While here he added con&s;iderable to his &s;tock, none of which he ever ve&s;ted in real e|&s;tate; the Continental currency taught him that wealth could take to it&s;elf wings and fly away: Not|with&s;tanding all his vigilance.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="017828_0005_0FB81A2F45A98A08">
When the war commenced he had on hand a very hand&s;ome a&s;&s;ortment of goods for a country &s;tore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hich he &s;old for the currency of the country, with|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut any advance in the price; the money he laid by, waiting and expecting the time would &s;oon arrive when he might therewith replace his goods, re&s;olv|ing not to part with it until it &s;hould be in as good demand as when received by him. His expectations from this quarter daily le&s;&s;ening, finally lo&s;t all hope, and was thrown into a &s;tate little better than di&s;pair, as appears from his writings; he adopted a plan of the mo&s;t rigid family oeconomy, but &s;till kept up the outward appearance of his former affluence, and ever to the la&s;t entertained his friend with his u&s;ual decent ho&s;pitality, although nothing appeared in his outward deportment, which evinced the uncommon pride of his heart; his writtings &s;hew clearly that he was de|termined not to bear the mortification of being thought by his friends poor and dependent. On this &s;ubject he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the following extraordinary manner: "If a man, who has once lived well, meant well and done well, falls by unavoidable accident in|to poverty, and then &s;ubmits to be laughed at, de|&s;pi&s;ed and trampled on, by a &s;et of mean wretches as far below him as the moon is below the &s;un; I &s;ay, if &s;uch a man &s;ubmits, he mu&s;t become meaner than meanne&s;s it&s;elf, and I &s;incerely wi&s;h he might have ten years added to his natural life to puni&s;h him for his folly."</P>
<P>He fixed upon the night &s;ucceeding the 18th of November for the execution of his nefarious purpo&s;e, and procured a &s;upper of oy&s;ters, of which the fami|ly eat very plentifully; that evening he writes as fol|lows:
<PB N="8" REF="017828_0006_0FB81A3236080030">
"I have prepared a noble &s;upper of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ters, that my flock and I may eat and drink together, thank God and die." After &s;upper he &s;ent the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d with a &s;tudied errand to a friend's hou&s;e at &s;ome di&s;tance, directing her to &s;tay until &s;he obtained an an&s;wer to an in&s;ignificant letter he wrote his friend, intending &s;he &s;hould not return that evening&mdash;&s;he did howe|ver return, perhaps her return di&s;concerted him and prevented him for that time. The next day he car|ried his pi&s;tols to a &s;mith for repair; it may be, the ill condition of his pi&s;tols might be an additional rea|&s;on for the delay.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 10th of December &s;ome per|&s;ons were with him at his hou&s;e, to whom he ap|peared as chearful and &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ene as u&s;ual; he attend|ed to the little affairs of his family as if nothing un|common was in contemplation. The company left him about nine o'clock in the evening, when he was urgent as u&s;ual for their &s;tay; whether he &s;lept that night is uncertain, but it is believed he went to bed. The children and maid &s;lept in one chamber; in the grey of the morning of the 11th of December he went to their bed chamber, awaked the maid and ordered her to ari&s;e gently without di&s;turbing the children; when &s;he came down &s;tairs he gave her a line to the family phy&s;ician, who lived at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, ordered her to carry it imme|diately, at the &s;ame time declaring that Mrs. Beadle had been ill all night, and directing her to &s;tay until the phy&s;ician &s;hould come with her; this he repeat|ed &s;undry times with a degree of ardor. There is much rea&s;on to believe he had murdered Mrs. Beadle be|fore he awaked the maid. Upon the maid's leaving
<PB N="9" REF="017828_0007_0FB81A361D4D28E0">
the hou&s;e he immediately proceeded to execute his purpo&s;e on the children and him&s;elf. It appears he had for &s;ome time before, carried to his be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ide e|very night an ax and a carving knife; he &s;mote his wife and each of the children with the ax on the &s;ide of the head as they lay &s;leeping in their beds; the wo|man had two wounds in the head, the &s;cull of each of them was fractured; he then with the carving knife cut their throats from ear to ear; the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">man and little boy were drawn partly over the &s;ide of their beds, as if to prevent the bedding from being be&s;mear|ed with blood&punc; the three daughters were taken from the bed and laid upon the floor &s;ide by &s;ide, like three lambs, before their throats were cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; they were co|vered with a blanket, and the woman's face with an handkerchief. He then proceeded to the lower floor of the hou&s;e, leaving marks of his foot&s;teps in blood on the &s;tairs, carrying with him the ax and knife&punc; the latter he laid upon the table in the room where he was found, reeking with the blood of his family. Perhaps he had thoughts he might u&s;e it again&s;t him|&s;elf if his pi&s;tols &s;hould fail; it appears he then &s;eated him&s;elf in a Wind&s;or chair, with his arms &s;upported by the arms of the chair; he fixed the muzles of the pi&s;tols into his two ears and fired them at the &s;ame in&s;tant: The balls went through the head in tran&s;|ver&s;e directions. Although the neighbours were ve|ry near and &s;ome of them awake, none hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d the report of the pi&s;tols. The capital facts of the ma&s;&s;a|cre you have &s;een in the public papers; a minu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e de|tail was too horrible to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iven at fir&s;t, until the mind (e&s;pecially of the relatives of the unhappy wo|man) had been prepared by a &s;ummary narrative,
<PB N="10" REF="017828_0008_0FB81A4019CD8F70">
and even now 'tis enough to give feelings to apathy it&s;elf, to relate the horrid tale.</P>
<P>The line to the phy&s;ician ob&s;curely announced the intentions of the man; the hou&s;e was &s;oon opened, but alas too late! The bodies were pale and motion|le&s;s, &s;wimming in their blood, their faces white as mountain &s;now, yet life &s;eemed to tremble at their lips; de&s;cription can do no more than faintly ape and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">fle with the real figure.</P>
<P>Such a tragical &s;cene filled every mind with the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s; nature recoiled and was on the rack with di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orting pa&s;&s;ions; the mo&s;t poignant &s;orrow and tender pity for the lady and her innocent babes, who were the haple&s;s victims of the brutal, &s;tudied cruelty of a hu&s;band and father, in who&s;e embraces they expected to find &s;ecurity, melted every heart.&mdash;Shocking effects of pride and fal&s;e notions about re|ligion.</P>

So awful and terrible a di&s;a&s;ter wrought wonderfully on the minds of the neighbourhood; nature it&s;elf &s;eemed ruffled, and refu&s;ed the kindly aid of balmy &s;leep for a time.</P>
<P>Near the clo&s;e of the day on the 12th of De|cember, the bodies being &s;till unburied, the people, who had collected in great numbers, grew almo&s;t frantic wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h rage, and in a manner demanded the bo|dy of the murderer; the law being &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, it was difficult to determine where decency required the body &s;hould be placed, many propo&s;ed it &s;hould be in an ignominious manner where four roads met, without any coffin or in&s;ignia of re&s;pect, and perforated by a &s;take. Upon which a que&s;tion aro&s;e, where that place could be found which might be unexceptionable to the neighbourhood&mdash;but no one would con&s;ent it &s;hould be near his hou&s;e or land. After &s;ome con&s;ultation it was thought be&s;t to place it on the bank of the river between high and low wa|ter mark; the body was handed out of the window and bound with cords on a &s;led, with the cloaths on as it was found, and the bloody knife tied on his brea&s;t, without coffin or box, and the hor&s;e he u&s;ua|ly rode was made fa&s;t to the fled&mdash;the hor&s;e, unac|cu&s;tomed to the draught, proceeded with great un|&s;teadine&s;s, &s;ometimes running full &s;peed, then &s;top|ping, followed by a multitude, until arriving at the water's edge, the body was tumbled into a hole dug for the purpo&s;e, like the carca&s;e of a bea&s;t.

<P>On the 13th of December the bodies of the mur|dered were interred in a manner much unlike that of the unnatural murderer.&mdash;The remains of the chil|dren were borne by a &s;uitable numb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r of equal age, attended with a &s;ad proce&s;&s;ion of youths of the town, all bathed in tears; &s;ide by &s;ide the haple&s;s woman's corp&s;e was carried in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion to the pari&s;h church yard, followed by a great concour&s;e, who with affectiona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e concern and every token of re&s;pect were anxious to expre&s;s their heart felt &s;orrows in performing the la&s;t mournful duties.</P>
<P>The per&s;on of Mr. Beadle was &s;mall, his features &s;triking and full of expre&s;&s;ion, with the a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ect of fiercene&s;s and determination; his mind was contem|plative, when once he had formed an opinion, was remarkably tenacious; as a merchant or trader, he was e&s;teemed a man of &s;trict honor and integrity, and would not de&s;cend to any low or mean artifice to advance his fortune. He was turned of 52 years of age when he died.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">le was born at Plymouh, in Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, of reputable parents&mdash;a comely per&s;on, of good

<P>The children (the elde&s;t of which was a &s;on, aged 12 years the other three, daughters, the younge&s;t aged 6 years) were &s;uch as cheared the hearts of their parents, who w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> uncommonly fond of di&s;playing their virtues and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">lencies, and &s;eemed to antici|pate a continuance of growing parental &s;atisfaction; alas! like early tender <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uds nipped by untimely fro&s;ts, they did but begin to live!</P>
<P>It is more than probable, this man had for months pa&s;t de&s;ired that &s;ome or all of his children might be taken out of the world by accident; he removed all means of &s;ecurity from a well near his hou&s;e, which he was careful heretofore to keep covered.

<P>He ever &s;poke lightly of death as a bugbear the world cau&s;ele&s;sly feared. It appears from his writings, he at fir&s;t had doubts whether it was ju&s;t and rea&s;onable for him to deprive his wife of life, and offers again&s;t it, only this rea&s;on, that he had no hand in bringing her into exi&s;tence and con&s;equently had no power over her life.&mdash;She &s;et out about the fir&s;t of November on a journey to Fairfield, which he thought was by direction of Heaven to clear him of his doubts and remove her out of the way, at the time the bu&s;i|ne&s;s was to be done; and his intention was to have execu|ted his de&s;ign on him&s;elf and children in her ab&s;ence. She

Yet this was the ca&s;e in this in|&s;tance, there was no vi&s;ible alteration in his conduct.

<HEAD>Extracts from the Rev. Mr. Mar&s;h's Sermon, preached at the Funeral of the Wife and Children of William Beadle.</HEAD>
<P>THE very &s;hocking and execrable deeds perpe|trated la&s;t Wedne&s;day morning by a man in this &s;ociety have led me to make the following ob&s;erva|tions.</P>
<P>That a per&s;on, favoured with Chri&s;tian light and liber|ty, who appeared to be an affectionate hu&s;band, and a tender, fond parent, &s;hould, with deliberation and in cool blood, ma&s;&s;acre an amiable wife, and four lovely and pro|mi&s;ing children, and then take away his own life, is an event &s;o extraordinary, &s;urprizing, and unheard of, that we can &s;carcely believe it a reality, though the corp&s;es of the unhappy woman and chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dren, with the mo&s;t affecting marks of violence upon them, are here pre&s;ent before our eyes.</P>
<P>Had he left no written account of his intentions and views re&s;pecting the de&s;truction of him&s;elf and family we &s;hould have been ready to con&s;ider it as the effect of a &s;udden and mo&s;t vehement frenzy. But by his writings he appears to have had it in contemplation for three years.</P>
<P>The time he fir&s;t fixed upon for carrying into exe|cution his horrid and dete&s;table purpo&s;e was the 18th of Nov. 1782. Not long before this he writes thus: "I mean to clo&s;e the eyes of &s;ix per&s;ons thro' perfect humani|ty, and the mo&s;t endearing fondne&s;s and friend&s;hip; for mortal father never felt more of the&s;e tender ties than my&s;elf.&mdash;How I &s;hall really perform the ta&s;k I have un|dertaken I know not 'till the moment arrives; but I be|lieve

I &s;hall perform it as deliberately, and as &s;teadily as I would go to &s;upper, or to bed."</P>
<P>In one of the la&s;t letters he wrote, there is the follow|ing pa&s;&s;age: "Any man that undertakes any great affair, and at the &s;ame time thinks, ought to be very deliberate indeed; and think and reflect again and again. On the morning of the &s;ixth of December I ro&s;e before the &s;un, felt calm, and left my wife between &s;leep and wake, went into the room where my infants lay, found them all &s;ound a&s;leep; the means of death were with me, but I had not before determined whether to &s;trike or not, but yet tho't it a good opportunity. I &s;tood over them and a&s;ked my God whether it was right or not, now to &s;trike; but no an|&s;wer came, nor I believe ever does to man while on earth. I then examined my&s;elf, there was neither fear, trembling nor horror about me. I then went into a chamber next to that, to look at my&s;elf in the gra&s;s; but I could di&s;cover no alteration in my countenance or feelings: this is true as God reigns, but for further trial I yet po&s;tpon|ed it." And when the fatal morning was come it does not appear by any one circum&s;tance, but that he &s;et him|&s;elf about and went thro' the ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">minable work of mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">der|ing his wife, four children and him&s;elf, with as much &s;teadine&s;s, compo&s;ure and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mne&s;s as he &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hould.</P>
<P>What a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;ter of a man was this! What were his principles that could lead him into &s;uch dete&s;table and more than &s;avage conduct? Surely it concerns us to know that we may guard again&s;t and avoid them as mo&s;t pernici|ous to individuals and &s;ocieties. Tho&s;e he has left a writ|ten account of.</P>
<P>Speaking of the Chri&s;tian religion he &s;ays, "It is a mo&s;t benevolent &s;y&s;tem, and would produce grand effects, if it was really believed and univer&s;ally practi&s;ed. I firmly believed it for many years; but my adherence to its pre|cepts when every one el&s;e for&s;ook them, has been my bane on earth: But never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ind that, if it is really true I &s;hall be &s;aved by it yet. And now I mu&s;t generou&s;ly own that I have as many doubts about the truth of that, as I have about the truth of any other &s;cheme of religion, that ever appeared in the world.&mdash;When I con&s;ider men as Chri&s;tians, I look on them as free agents; I have examin|ed both old and now Te&s;taments, and mu&s;t think T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">AT

is their true meaning and intent. But when I con&s;ider man as a Dei&s;t, or one that does not believe revelation, I think him a perfect machine, and that he can do nothing, but as he is operated upon by &s;ome &s;uperior power&mdash;I have renounced all the popular religions in the world, and mean to die a proper Dei&s;t. I really think there never was any thing done wrong in the world, but believe that all is right;&mdash;that we are all impelled to &s;ay and act, every thing that we do &s;ay and act.&mdash;That a tyrant king, or two or three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ce republicans deluging three quarters of the world in blood&mdash;that my killing my family&mdash;that a man's de&s;troying a ne&s;t of wa&s;ps, or a fly, is as much directed by the hand of heaven as the making this whole world was&mdash;And if this is the ca&s;e th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is no &s;uch thing as &s;in.</P>
<P>Thus he frankly owns that he had apo&s;tatized from the Chri&s;tian religion and embraced the principle of dei&s;m and fatali&s;m,&mdash;that he believed men to be meer machines, and God the author of all their actions in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as to ex|clude the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;in from the world. The idea of future puni&s;hment he al&s;o rejects, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the good|ne&s;s of God, though he &s;ays, "I know by experience there is no want of hells in this &s;tate of things." And &s;eems to be full in the opinion that he and his &s;hall be happy in the future world whether he be rig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> or not in rejecting the Chri&s;tian revelation.</P>
<P>The&s;e principles appear to have had a main influence in reconciling him to actions, which have a &s;elf-evident criminality in them, which every man's mind, at fir&s;t view, cannot but abhor and condemn.</P>
<P>Pride, imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tience, and cowardice fir&s;t led him to think of de&s;troying him&s;elf and family, and operated power|fully in bringing him to determine upon it. He had a high opinion of his intellectual abilities; and was un|ea&s;y with the meanne&s;s of his per&s;onal appearance, and &s;lenderne&s;s of his fortune. He writes, "My per&s;on is &s;mall and mean to look on, and my circum&s;tances were always rather narrow; which were great di&s;advantages in this world: But I have great rea&s;on to think that my &s;oul is above the common mould.&mdash;There are but few men ca|pable of dei&s;m: they are when &s;ound like a diamond among millions of pebbles."</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="017828_0019_0FB81A6168AF4C68">
He murmured and complained of Providence in the following language; "I was determined not to ha&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the matter" (of de&s;troying him&s;elf and family) "but kept hoping that yet Providence would turn up &s;omething to prevent it, if the intent were wrong: but in&s;tead of that every circum&s;tance, from the greate&s;t to the &s;malle&s;t tri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e, during the whole of that term" (i. e. three years) "and long before only tended to convince me that the u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mo&s;t malevolence of fortune was, and is, again&s;t me, on earth. I have borne "the &s;tings and arrows of out|ragous fortune" long enough; and "by oppo&s;ing I can only end them.</P>
<P>Being too haughty to &s;ubmit to the humbling di&s;pen&s;a|tions of Providence, and not having fortitude and courage enough to encounter and &s;u&s;tain the inconveniences ari&s;|ing from &s;traitened circum&s;tances, he entertained the cowardly thought of flying from them and taking &s;anctu|ary in the unknown world: But the guilt and danger of &s;uch conduct, upon &s;uppo&s;ition of the truth of the &s;ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed &s;criptures, were too apparant to &s;uffer him to re&s;olve upon it, before he had brought him&s;elf to di&s;believe and re|ject them. And to render it &s;till le&s;s hazardous in his view he gave into the fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ali&s;tic &s;cheme, judging God to be &s;o far the author of all the actions of men, as to allow them no other agency than that of meer machines; and upon this Hypothe&s;is concluded that there is no &s;in. In which he is doubtle&s;s more con&s;i&s;tent than tho&s;e who admit the &s;ame hypothe&s;is, and yet hold that men are account|able for their conduct.</P>
<P>But even &s;uch a view of the actions of men, added to his profe&s;&s;ed di&s;belief of the Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e bible and future puni&s;hment, was not &s;ufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">isfy him with re|&s;pect to his &s;afety in perpetrating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eeds &s;o unnatural and at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ious; and therefore he called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n the aid of &s;anatici&s;m and &s;uper&s;tition.</P>

<P>In another letter, &s;peaking of the intended ma&s;&s;acre of him&s;elf and family, he &s;ays, "In fine clear days, when I am mo&s;t chearful, and in a morning when I fir&s;t wake, free from any di&s;turbance, I &s;eem to be con|vinced in a &s;teady, calm and rea&s;onable way, that it is appointed for me to do it&mdash;that it is my duty and mu&s;t be done.

Such dreams, related in the manner we may &s;uppo&s;e they were by her, had a natural tendency to move the ten|der pa&s;&s;ions, and give a check to his pernicious de&s;igns.

<P>Can we &s;uppo&s;e it &s;trange, that &s;uch an one &s;hould be given over by God to "&s;trong delu&s;ion, that he &s;hould believe a lie&punc; that he might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had plea&s;ure in unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s?"</P>
<P>The horrid deeds perpetrated by this man under the influence of &s;uch principles, are a more effectual con|futation of tho&s;e principles, than any it is in the pow|er of language to produce.</P>

The terrible judgment of heaven in permitting one, who prided him&s;elf in the character of a dei&s;t and fatali&s;t, to be carried by his error to &s;o dreadful a length as with deliberation and di&s;pa&s;&s;ion to murder him&s;elf and his whole family, I am ready to think, will, wherever it is known, &s;trike terror into the minds of all who glory in &s;uch a character, if any thing will produce &s;uch an effect, &s;hort of the coming of the Judge of the world in flaming fire, to take vengeance on his enemies.</P>
