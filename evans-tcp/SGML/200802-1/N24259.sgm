<P>I BEGAN this Di&s;&s;ertation before I &s;aw Dr. We&s;t's &s;econd edition of his <HI>Fir&s;t Part</HI> publi&s;hed with his <HI>Second Part:</HI> But on hearing, that he was about to publi&s;h his &s;entiments on Liberty and Nece&s;&s;ity more largely, I &s;u&s;pended the pro&s;ecution of my de&s;ign, that I might &s;ee what he &s;hould further publi&s;h. Since the pub|lication of the &s;econd part, I have been nece&s;&s;arily though reluctantly kept back till this time, from fini&s;hing what I had begun. At length I &s;end it forth, reque&s;ting the candour of all who &s;hall read it.

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. Of Natural and Moral Nece&s;&s;ity and Inability.</HEAD>
<P>_PRESIDENT Edwards, in his book on <HI>the Freedom of Will,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hes between <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity and inability. By <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity he tells us, he means,
<Q>That nece&s;&s;ity of connection and con&s;equence, which ari&s;es from &s;uch moral cau&s;|es, as the &s;trength of inclination or motives, and the connection which there is in many ca&s;es between the&s;e and certain volitions and actions.</Q>
P. 21. By <HI>natural</HI> nece&s;&s;ity he explains him&s;elf to mean,
<Q>Such nece&s;&s;ity as men are under, through the force of <HI>natural</HI> cau&s;es, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from what are call|ed <HI>moral</HI> cau&s;es; &s;uch as habits and di&s;po&s;itions of heart, and moral motives and inducements.</Q>
Ibid. He further holds, that
<Q>the difference between the&s;e two kinds of nece&s;&s;ity, does not lie &s;o much in the <HI>nature</HI> of the connection, as in the <HI>two terms</HI> con|nected;</Q>
that in moral nece&s;&s;ity,
<Q>the cau&s;e &mdash; is of a <HI>moral</HI> nature, either &s;ome <HI>previous habitual di&s;|po&s;ition,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="032073_0004_0FF11096C37A1360">
or &s;ome <HI>motive</HI> exhibited to the under&s;tand|ing: And the effect is al&s;o &mdash; of a moral nature &mdash; &s;ome <HI>inclination</HI> or <HI>volition</HI> of the &s;oul or <HI>vol|untary action.</HI></Q>
P. 22. Al&s;o he held, that natural nece&s;&s;ity always
<Q>has reference to &s;ome &s;uppo&s;able voluntary oppo&s;ition or endeavour, which is in&s;uffi|cient. But no &s;uch oppo&s;ition or contrary will and endeavour is &s;uppo&s;able in the ca&s;e of moral nece&s;&s;i|ty, which is <HI>a certainty of the inclination and will it|&s;elf,</HI> which does not admit of the &s;uppo&s;ition of a will to oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t it. For it is ab&s;urd to &s;up|po&s;e the &s;ame individual will to oppo&s;e it&s;elf <HI>in its pre&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t act.</HI></Q>
P. 23, 24. And p. 16.
<Q>Philo&s;ophical <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> is really nothing el&s;e than the full and fixed connection between the things &s;ignified by the &s;ub|ject and predicate of a propo&s;ition. When there is &s;uch a connection, then the thing affirmed in the propo&s;ition is nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;In this &s;en&s;e I u&s;e the word <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> &mdash; when I endeavor to prove, that <HI>nece&s;&s;ity is not incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty.</HI></Q>
Ibid.
<Q>Philo&s;ophical nece&s;&s;ity is nothing different from the certainty that is in things them&s;elves, which is the foundation of the certainty of the knowledge of them.</Q></P>
<P>This is the account given by Pre&s;ident Edwards, of the di&s;tinction, which he made between natural and moral nece&s;&s;ity. Moral nece&s;&s;ity is the certain or nece&s;&s;ary connection between moral cau&s;es and moral effects; natural nece&s;&s;ity is the connection between cau&s;es and effects, which are not of a moral nature. The difference between the&s;e two kinds of nece&s;&s;ity lies chiefly in the nature of <HI>the two terms</HI> connected by it. Natural nece&s;&s;ity admits of voluntary, but in|effectual oppo&s;ition from him who is &s;ubject to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity; the immediate effect, produced by that ne|ce&s;&s;ity, may be oppo&s;ed by the will of the &s;ubject. But with re&s;pect to moral nece&s;&s;ity, which is a pre|vious certainty of the exi&s;tence of a volition or volun|tary action, it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>in that act</HI> the
<PB N="7" REF="032073_0005_0FF10FDCFA325890">
will &s;hould either oppo&s;e it&s;elf, or the nece&s;&s;ity from which the act ari&s;es.&mdash;The di&s;tinction between natu|ral and moral inability is analogous to this. Inability is the rever&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Now Dr. We&s;t tells us, that this
<Q>is a di&s;tinction without a difference, p. 8.</Q>
But if the terms con|nected in the&s;e ca&s;es be different, as Pre&s;ident Ed|wards &s;uppo&s;es; if in one ca&s;e
<Q>the cau&s;e, with which the effect is connected, be &s;ome previous habitual di&s;|po&s;ition, or &s;ome motive exhibited to the under|&s;tanding; and the effect be a volition or voluntary action; in the other, the cau&s;e be neither an habit|ual di&s;po&s;ition nor a motive exhibited to the under|&s;tanding, and the effect be neither a volition nor a voluntary action; it is manife&s;t, that there is that ve|ry difference in the two ca&s;es, which Pre&s;ident Ed|wards's di&s;tinction &s;uppo&s;es.</Q>
To &s;ay, that this is a di&s;|tinction without a difference, is to &s;ay, that an habitu|al di&s;po&s;ition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gentlemen may differ in their explanations of that habitual di&s;po&s;ition or bias, which is the cau&s;e or antecedent of volition or voluntary action; &s;ome &s;up|po&s;ing it to be a certain ca&s;t or mould of the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;oul; others &s;up|po&s;ing it to con&s;i&s;t in a divine con&s;titution, that volitions of a certain kind, &s;hall, in a regular manner and on certain conditions, &s;ucceed each other in the mind. But it does not appear, that Pre&s;ident Edwards meant to decide this que&s;tion.</NOTE> or a motive, is the &s;ame with &s;omething, which is not an habitual di&s;po&s;ition or motive; and that a volition or voluntary action, is the &s;ame with what is not a volition or voluntary action.</P>
<P>But Dr. We&s;t endeavours to &s;upport his charge of a di&s;tinction without a difference. Let us attend to what he offers with this view: It is this, "That," according to Pre&s;ident Edwards,
<Q>the principal, if not the only difference between natural&mdash;and moral nece&s;&s;ity and inability, is, that in the former ca&s;e, the oppo&s;i|tion and endeavour again&s;t what does take place, is overcome and borne down by a &s;uperiour force; but in the latter kind of nece&s;&s;ity and inability there is no oppo&s;ition and endeavour, that is overcome by any &s;uperiour force. But that Mr. Edwards's moral ne|ce&s;&s;ity and inability are attended with as much in&s;uf|ficient oppo&s;ition and endeavour, as his natural nece&s;|&s;ity
<PB N="8" REF="032073_0006_0FF1101676420B90">
and inability; p. 8.</Q>
Whether this, which is here &s;aid to be, be indeed according to Pre&s;ident Edwards the only or the principal difference between natural and moral nece&s;&s;ity and inability, I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent &s;tand to di&s;pute. It is &s;ufficient for my pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e to &s;how, that Pre&s;ident Edwards's moral nece&s;&s;ity and inability are not, and cannot be attended with as much in&s;ufficient oppo&s;ition and endeavour, as his nat|ural nece&s;&s;ity and inability.</P>
<P>Natural nece&s;&s;ity may compel a man to that, to which his whole will is entirely oppo&s;ed, and again&s;t which he puts forth all the oppo&s;ition, of which his &s;trength of body and mind admits: As when he is thrown from a precipice or is dragged to pri&s;on. But a man's whole will is never oppo&s;ed to the influence of that bias, di&s;po&s;ition or motive, or of any moral ne|ce&s;&s;ity, with which he complies. Whenever any of the&s;e influences a man to put forth a volition or a vol|untary external action, it prevails on his will; his will therefore con&s;ents, though it may be with &s;ome degree of reluctance occa&s;ioned by the other bias or motive. Nothing is more common than &s;uch oppo&s;ition between rea&s;on or con&s;cience, and depraved appetite; between covetou&s;ne&s;s and ambition; indolence and a wi&s;h for gain, &amp;c. But whenever any of the&s;e principles be|comes &s;tronger than its oppo&s;ite, the will con&s;ents, and the man acts voluntarily under the influence of moral nece&s;&s;ity; and though he may act with &s;ome degree of reluctance from the oppo&s;ite principle, yet no man will &s;ay, that he is compelled to act again&s;t his <HI>whole</HI> will, or even again&s;t his &s;tronge&s;t inclination; for by the very ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed, he acts agreeably to his &s;trong|e&s;t inclination.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By <HI>inclination, di&s;po&s;ition</HI> or <HI>bias</HI>&punc; I mean &s;omething di&s;tinct from volition. This di&s;tinction is made by Dr. We&s;t, p. 13.</NOTE> But by natural nece&s;&s;ity he is or may be compelled to that, to which every inclination and act of his will, the &s;tronge&s;t as well as the mo&s;t feeble, is mo&s;t directly oppo&s;ed. A man dragged to pri&s;on may be compelled to enter it, in direct oppo&s;ition to
<PB N="9" REF="032073_0007_0FF1101800900EE8">
every act of his will. This is natural nece&s;&s;ity. But an indolent man, who is influenced to labour by the pro&s;pect of gain, is not compelled to labour in oppo|&s;ition to every inclination or act of his will, but complies with the &s;tronger inclination and act, in oppo&s;ition to the weaker, which would lead him to indulge him&s;elf in ca&s;e. This is an in&s;tance of moral nece&s;&s;ity.&mdash;One difference between natural nece&s;&s;ity and moral, is, that every inclination and act of the will does or may di|rectly oppo&s;e natural nece&s;&s;ity; but every act of will always coincides with that moral nece&s;&s;ity, from which it ari&s;es, and when there is a &s;truggle between differ|ent inclinations or propen&s;ities and their acts, the acts of that which prevails, never oppo&s;e the moral nece&s;&s;i|ty by which they take place.</P>
<P>When Pre&s;ident Edwards &s;ays, that no voluntary in|&s;ufficient oppo&s;ition or endeavour is &s;uppo&s;able in the ca&s;e of moral nece&s;&s;ity; his evident meaning is, that it is not &s;uppo&s;able, that an act of the will &s;hould be op|po&s;ed to that moral nece&s;&s;ity, by which it takes place. For in&s;tance, if a man be under a moral nece&s;&s;ity of choo&s;ing a virtuous cour&s;e of life, this choice is not op|po&s;ed to the nece&s;&s;ity, which is the &s;ource of it, nor is it &s;uppo&s;able, that it &s;hould be oppo&s;ed to it or at all re|&s;i&s;t it. The ca&s;e is very different with regard to natu|ral nece&s;&s;ity. A man dragged to execution may in every re&s;pect oppo&s;e with his will, that nece&s;&s;ity, by which he is carried on.</P>
<P>But though a man, who is determined by moral ne|ce&s;&s;ity to choo&s;e a virtuous cour&s;e, cannot <HI>in that act</HI> oppo&s;e that choice or the cau&s;e of it; yet he may <HI>in other acts</HI> of his will oppo&s;e both this choice and the cau&s;e, and thus in different acts choo&s;e and act incon|&s;i&s;tently. He may from prevailing motives and from moral nece&s;&s;ity, choo&s;e virtue. He may at the &s;ame time from weaker motives and ineffectual temptations, choo&s;e vice, and &s;o far feel reluctant or indi&s;po&s;ed to virtue. And this weaker choice is no more oppo&s;ed to the moral nece&s;&s;ity, which cau&s;es it, than the &s;tronger
<PB N="10" REF="032073_0008_0FF10FF6B37DF608">
choice of virtue is to the moral nece&s;&s;ity which cau&s;es that. In both there is no &s;uppo&s;able oppo&s;ition to their re&s;pective nece&s;&s;ities, which are their cau&s;es. This is true with re&s;pect to every choice whether &s;tronger or weaker, whether prevailing to govern the heart and conduct, or not. Yet there is a mutual op|po&s;ition between the forementioned different acts of choice, the choice of virtue and choice of vice. In|deed the&s;e two oppo&s;ite choices cannot both prevail, &s;o as to govern the heart and life at the &s;ame time. They may in particular ca&s;es be equal, or &s;o nearly equal, that neither of them at that in&s;tant appears to pre|vail, and the man "is in a &s;trait betwixt two." In oth|er in&s;tances they may for a time at lea&s;t alternately pre|vail, and exhibit a man of very incon&s;i&s;tent conduct. In other in&s;tances one may generally prevail, and de|nominate the &s;ubject a virtuous or vicious man, accord|ingly as the choice and love of virtue, or of vice, pre|vails and governs him. Thus we &s;hall have all tho&s;e four modes of in&s;ufficient oppo&s;ition to moral nece&s;&s;i|ty, which Dr. We&s;t &s;ays, p. 10, Pre&s;ident Edwards al|lows may take place, and from which he argues that Pre&s;ident Edwards's moral nece&s;&s;ity may be attended with as much in&s;ufficient oppo&s;ition, as his natural ne|ce&s;&s;ity; and that therefore Pre&s;ident Edwards's di&s;tinc|tion between natural and moral nece&s;&s;ity is without a difference. 1. The weaker motives to vice may oppo&s;e the &s;tronger motives to virtue. 2. The man may <HI>now</HI> have &s;trong and prevailing acts, de&s;ires and re&s;olutions again&s;t tho&s;e acts of vice, to which he fore&s;ees he &s;hall in certain circum&s;tances be expo&s;ed, and which be ac|tually indulges, when the fore&s;een circum&s;tances take place. 3. The will may remotely and indirectly re&s;i&s;t it&s;elf, not in the &s;ame acts, but in different acts; the depraved appetites may &s;truggle again&s;t the principles of virtue. 4. Rea&s;on pleading in favour of virtue, may re&s;i&s;t the pre&s;ent acts, which incline, and perhaps pre|vailingly, to vice. Nor is there any thing in all this, but what was long &s;ince ob&s;erved by the poet, and has
<PB N="11" REF="032073_0009_0FF10FFD145DB6F0">
always been noticed by all attentive ob&s;ervers of hu|man nature:
<Q>"Video meliora, proboque; deteriora &s;equor."</Q></P>
<P>Now, it will not be pretended, that this oppo&s;ition of one act of the will, to another, is parallel to the en|tire oppo&s;ition of the will which there is or may be, to natural nece&s;&s;ity; <HI>e. g.</HI> to falling when a man is thrown down a precipice, or to going to the gallows, when a man is forced thither. In the latter ca&s;e, there is or may be an entire and perfect oppo&s;ition of the whole will, to the nece&s;&s;ity. In the former, there is a con|&s;ent of the will to the nece&s;&s;ity, though there may be a degree of oppo&s;ite choice ari&s;ing from &s;ome other motive, bias, cau&s;e or nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t infers from this actual or po&s;&s;ible oppo&s;i|tion of the acts of one propen&s;ity in human nature, to tho&s;e of another, acknowledged by Pre&s;ident Edwards, that all tho&s;e acts which admit of this oppo&s;ition are nece&s;&s;ary with natural nece&s;&s;ity. If this inference be ju&s;t, doubt|le&s;s every act of the human will is nece&s;&s;ary with na|tural nece&s;&s;ity. If a man choo&s;e virtue, he doubtle&s;s does or may from temptation feel &s;ome inclination to vice. In this ca&s;e then his choice of virtue is, accord|ing to the rea&s;oning of Dr. We&s;t, the effect of natural nece&s;&s;ity; for natural nece&s;&s;ity is, according to that rea|&s;oning, that which admits of any voluntary oppo&s;ition. And as there is no propen&s;ity in human nature, which may not be oppo&s;ed by &s;ome other propen&s;ity; and as the human mind is not capable of any act, which may not be attended with &s;ome degree of reluctance at lea&s;t; there|fore human nature is not capable of any act, which is not nece&s;&s;itated with a natural nece&s;&s;ity, a nece&s;&s;ity, which is equally incon&s;i&s;tent with prai&s;e and blame, as that by which a man falls, when he is thrown from an eminence.</P>
<P>This oppo&s;ition of one propen&s;ity in human nature to another, and of one act of the will to another, is a|bundantly granted by Dr. We&s;t: So that if this prove or imply a natural nece&s;&s;ity, he holds that the acts of the will are &s;ubject to natural nece&s;&s;ity. P. 14.
<Q>A
<PB N="12" REF="032073_0010_0FF110988D7FCB98">
man may <HI>love</HI> a per&s;on, whom he knows to be utterly unworthy of his affections, and may really <HI>choo&s;e</HI> to eradicate this propen&s;ion from his mind; and yet he may find this pa&s;&s;ion ri&s;ing in his brea&s;t, in direct op|po&s;ition to his <HI>will</HI> or <HI>choice.</HI> And the &s;ame ob&s;erva|tions may be made with re&s;pect to every other pro|pen&s;ion in the human mind. <HI>They may all be in di|rect oppo&s;ition to pre&s;ent acts of the will and choice.</HI> Were not this the ca&s;e, there could be no &s;truggle in the mind, to overcome wrong propen&s;ions and vicious habits. But common experience will teach us, that there is frequently a very great &s;truggle in the mind, to gain the victory over vile affections.</Q>
Whatever di&s;tinction Dr. We&s;t makes between propen&s;ion and volition, he will doubtle&s;s grant, that there may be acts of the will agreeable to a propen&s;ion, as well as in op|po&s;ition to it; that there may be volitions and actions agreeable to a vicious propen&s;ion, and yet there may be a &s;truggle of virtuous propen&s;ion and volition in op|po&s;ition to the vicious. On the other hand, there may be a &s;truggle of vicious propen&s;ion and volition in op|po&s;ition to the virtuous. Dr. We&s;t will not deny that love to God, to his law and to virtue, is a voluntary exerci&s;e. Now he who has a degree of voluntary love to God and true virtue, and a degree of volun|tary love to vice, has an oppo&s;ition not only of pro|pen&s;ions, but of voluntary acts and exerci&s;es, <HI>i. e.</HI> of volitions. Yet would Dr. We&s;t allow, that this love of virtue, which is oppo&s;ed by a degree of love to vice, is nece&s;&s;itated by a natural nece&s;&s;ity? This will follow from the principle of his argument to prove, that Pre&s;i|dent Edwards's moral nece&s;&s;ity is really a natural nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t, p. 14, a&s;&s;erts,
<Q>that it is ab&s;urd, that the will &s;hould directly oppo&s;e its own pre&s;ent acts;</Q>
and yet in p. 9, he &s;ays,
<Q>there may be will and en|deavour again&s;t, or diver&s;e from <HI>pre&s;ent acts of the will.</HI></Q>
The&s;e propo&s;itions &s;eem incapable of recon|ciliation, unle&s;s on the ground of the di&s;tinction, which I have made between the will oppo&s;ing it&s;elf
<PB N="13" REF="032073_0011_0FF1101B27A932C0">
in the &s;ame acts, and in different acts ari&s;ing from dif|ferent motives or propen&s;ities.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ident Edwards con&s;tantly holds, that natural nece&s;&s;ity and inability are incon&s;i&s;tent with blame in any in&s;tance. The rea&s;on of this is, that all our &s;in|cere and mo&s;t ardent de&s;ires and acts of will, as well as external endeavours, may be re&s;i&s;ted, oppo&s;ed and overcome as to their effects. But this is not the ca&s;e in moral nece&s;&s;ity and inability; therefore they do not excu&s;e from blame. When under a moral ne|ce&s;&s;ity we will to do an action, our &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and acts of will coincide with the moral nece&s;&s;ity, and we voluntarily act agreeably to it. And if we have weaker wi&s;hes and de&s;ires oppo&s;ing the nece&s;&s;i|ty and the &s;tronger de&s;ires and acts of our will, which follow from that nece&s;&s;ity, we are not to be excu&s;ed from blame on that account, becau&s;e on the whole we con&s;ent to do the action. No man will pretend, that he who is influenced by the malice of his own heart, to murder his neighbour, is excu&s;able in that action, becau&s;e he has &s;ome weak and ineffectual re|luctance ari&s;ing from a knowledge of the divine law and from the dictates of his own con&s;cience.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid by &s;ome of our opponents in this di&s;qui&s;ition, that they cannot find out what we mean by moral nece&s;&s;ity, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from natural or phy&s;ical. If it be not &s;ufficiently plain from his own writings, what Pre&s;ident Edwards meant by it, I can only give my opinion concerning his meaning. But concerning my own meaning I have a right to &s;peak more peremptorily, that I mean all nece&s;&s;ity or pre|vious certainty of the volition or voluntary action of a rational being, whatever be the cau&s;e or influence, by which that nece&s;&s;ity is e&s;tabli&s;hed, or the volition brought into exi&s;tence, and however great and effica|cious that influence be. When "God's people are made willing in the day of his power," there is doubt|le&s;s a nece&s;&s;ity of their being willing. This nece&s;&s;ity I call a moral nece&s;&s;ity. Again&s;t this willingne&s;s, or
<PB N="14" REF="032073_0012_0FF10FF93445ED70">
the nece&s;&s;ity, or the nece&s;&s;itating cau&s;e, from which it ari&s;es, the will of him who is made willing, does not and cannot po&s;&s;ibly make entire and direct oppo&s;i|tion. By the very &s;uppo&s;ition he is made willing, his will therefore coincides with the nece&s;&s;ity and con|&s;ents to it; and &s;o far as it con&s;ents, it cannot di&s;&s;ent or make oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Some &s;eem to imagine, that the difference between natural and moral nece&s;&s;ity, is, that the former is the effect of a &s;trong and irre&s;i&s;tible cau&s;e; but the lat|ter of a weak one, which may be re&s;i&s;ted and over|come; and that entire oppo&s;ition of will is &s;uppo&s;able in both ca&s;es; though with this difference, that in nat|ural nece&s;&s;ity it is ineffectual, but in moral it may be ef|fectual. Whereas the truth is, that let the cau&s;e of a moral act be what it will, it involves a moral nece&s;|&s;ity only, becau&s;e it is not &s;uppo&s;able, that the will &s;hould be entirely oppo&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons abovementioned object to the appli|cation of &s;uch &s;trong epithets as <HI>infallible, unavoidable, unalterable, unfru&s;trable,</HI> &amp;c. to moral nece&s;&s;ity and inability, &s;uppo&s;ing that they imply a natural nece&s;&s;i|ty incon&s;i&s;tent with prai&s;e and blame. But when our Lord had given the prediction, was there not an in|fallible, unavoidable, unalterable and unfru&s;trable cer|tainty, that Judas would betray his Lord? And will it be pretended, that on that account he was not to be blamed for &s;o doing? Yet this action of Judas was rendered no more unfru&s;trably nece&s;&s;ary by the prediction, than it was before, as it was before cer|tainly foreknown. Nor was it more c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tainly fore|known, than every event and every moral action, which ever has or will come to pa&s;s. Therefore all moral actions are unfru&s;trably certain previou&s;ly to their exi&s;tence; and all tho&s;e epithets are as prop|erly applicable to them, as to the treachery of Judas, after it was divinely predicted.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that till the mea&s;ure of influence implied in moral nece&s;&s;ity, is di&s;tinctly known, it is
<PB N="15" REF="032073_0013_0FF1101CB6488BA0">
impo&s;&s;ible to tell, when or how far a per&s;on is re|wardable or puni&s;hable. But this is &s;aid, under a mi&s;taken idea of moral nece&s;&s;ity, viz. that moral ne|ce&s;&s;ity implies a low degree of influence only. Mor|al nece&s;&s;ity is the real and certain connection be|tween &s;ome moral action and its cau&s;e; and there is no moral <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> in the ca&s;e, unle&s;s the connection be real and ab&s;olutely certain, &s;o as to <HI>en&s;ure</HI> the ex|i&s;tence of the action. And will it be pretended, that if the mea&s;ure of influence be increa&s;ed beyond this, the nece&s;&s;ity cea&s;es to be moral and becomes natural? That if a motive or a malicious temper be barely &s;uf|ficient certainly and infallibly to influence a man to murder his neighbour, the nece&s;&s;ity is moral and the man is blamable; but if it become more than barely &s;ufficient for this, &s;o as to excite him to perpetrate the action with great eagerne&s;s and with the overflow|ing of malice, that in this ca&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity is natur|al and the man entirely unblamable?&mdash;The truth is, that there is no incon&s;i&s;tence between the mo&s;t ef|ficacious influence in moral nece&s;&s;ity and accounta|blene&s;s. Let the influence be ever &s;o great, &s;till the man acts voluntarily, and there is no &s;uppo&s;able en|tire oppo&s;ition of will; and as he is a rational crea|ture, he is accountable for his voluntary actions. The contrary &s;uppo&s;ition implies, that in order to account|ablene&s;s a man mu&s;t have a liberty of <HI>contingence,</HI> and it mu&s;t be, previou&s;ly to his acting, <HI>uncertain</HI> how he will act. A bare previous certainty of the voluntary action of an intelligent being is as incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty and accountablene&s;s, as any po&s;&s;ible degree of influence producing &s;uch an action. In either ca&s;e there is an equal con&s;ent of the will, and an entire oppo&s;ition of the will is no more &s;uppo&s;able in the one ca&s;e, than in the other.</P>
<P>Some in&s;i&s;t, that moral nece&s;&s;ity and inability are always of our own procuring; and whatever nece&s;&s;i|ty is not cau&s;ed by our&s;elves is not moral nece&s;&s;ity. But moral nece&s;&s;ity is the previous certainty of a
<PB N="16" REF="032073_0014_0FF1101F0DE87878">
moral action. Now as it was divinely foretold, ages before it came to pa&s;s, that the Jews would crucify our Lord, and that the man of &s;in would per&s;ecute the &s;aints, &amp;c. &amp;c. there was a moral nece&s;&s;ity, that tho&s;e facts &s;hould come to pa&s;s: And as this nece&s;&s;i|ty exi&s;ted long before the perpetrators of tho&s;e facts exi&s;ted, they did not cau&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity. Therefore according to this account of moral and natural nece&s;&s;i|ty, it was a natural nece&s;&s;ity, and the Jews and the man of &s;in were in tho&s;e actions, as innocent as they were in breathing or in any involuntary motion.&mdash;Further, as all the actions of rational creatures are foreknown by God, before the authors of them come into exi&s;tence, they are equally certain and nece&s;&s;ary, as tho&s;e which are predicted. But this nece&s;&s;ity, for the rea&s;on already given, cannot be the effect of tho&s;e, who&s;e actions they are. Therefore either this is not a natural ne|ce&s;&s;ity, or there never was, is now nor can be any crime or &s;in in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Dr. Clarke in his Remarks on Collins gives a true account of moral nece&s;&s;ity; p. 16.
<Q>By <HI>moral nece&s;&s;i|ty</HI> con&s;i&s;tent writers never mean any more than to expre&s;s in a figurative manner, the <HI>certainty</HI> of &s;uch an event.</Q>
And he illu&s;trates it by the impo&s;&s;ibili|ty, that the world &s;hould come to an end this year, if God have promi&s;ed that it &s;hall continue anoth|er year. Yet in his di&s;pute with <HI>Leibnitz</HI> he gives a very different account of it; p. 289.
<Q>That a good being, continuing to be good, cannot do evil; or a wi&s;e being, continuing to be wi&s;e, cannot do un|wi&s;ely; or a veracious per&s;on, continuing to be ve|racious, cannot tell a lie; is <HI>moral nece&s;&s;ity.</HI></Q>
This la&s;t account implies no other nece&s;&s;ity, than that a thing mu&s;t be when it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be; which is no more than the trifling propo&s;ition, that <HI>what is, is.</HI> But the certainty implied in the divine prediction, that the world will continue to a particular period, is a very different matter.&mdash;Dr. We&s;t, if I under&s;tand him, has adopted the la&s;t account given by Dr. Clarke of mor|al
<PB N="17" REF="032073_0015_0FF110209FBB7578">
nece&s;&s;ity. No doubt he and Dr. Clarke had a right to give their own definitions of moral nece&s;&s;ity; but Dr. We&s;t had no right to impute his idea to Pre&s;ident Edwards, and then di&s;pute again&s;t it as belonging to him. Dr. Clarke's la&s;t de&s;cribed moral nece&s;&s;ity would exi&s;t, if human volitions came into exi&s;tence by a &s;elf-determining power or by mere chance. On ei|ther of tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, <HI>what is, is,</HI> and mu&s;t be, &s;o long as it is. But Pre&s;ident Edwards's idea of moral nece&s;&s;ity is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with volitions' coming into exi&s;tence by chance, or by &s;elf-determination, unle&s;s &s;elf-determination be previou&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>In all matters of di&s;pute, it ought to be con&s;idered how far the parties are agreed, and wherein they dif|fer. As to natural and moral nece&s;&s;ity, I believe both parties are agreed, in this, that all nece&s;&s;ity incon&s;i&s;t|ent with moral agency, or prai&s;e and blame, is natur|al nece&s;&s;ity; and that all nece&s;&s;ity con&s;i&s;tent with prai&s;e and blame, is moral nece&s;&s;ity. Therefore if&punc; all ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the volitions of rational beings, be con&s;i&s;tent with prai&s;e and blame; all &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity is moral ne|ce&s;&s;ity. But if any nece&s;&s;ity of the volitions of a ra|tional being, be incon&s;i&s;tent with prai&s;e and blame; then I have given an erroneous account of moral ne|ce&s;&s;ity. Therefore on this let us join i&s;&s;ue. If an in|&s;tance can be produced of the volition of a rational being in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, as to be on that ac|count the proper object of neither prai&s;e nor blame; I will confe&s;s, that I am mi&s;taken in my idea of moral nece&s;&s;ity. But until &s;uch an in&s;tance can be produced, may I not fairly pre&s;ume, that my idea is right?&mdash; If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that no volitions of rational crea|tures are in any &s;en&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, or that they are not previou&s;ly certain; I recur to the in&s;tances of Judas's treachery, Peter's fal&s;ehood, Pharaoh's refu&s;al to let I&s;|rael go, and to every other voluntary action of a ra|tional being divinely predicted or foreknown.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould di&s;pute, whether this previous cer|tainty of voluntary actions, be properly called <HI>nece&s;&s;i|ty;</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="032073_0016_0FF11023257F26D0">
this would be a merely <HI>verbal</HI> di&s;pute, which they who choo&s;e, may agitate to their full &s;atisfaction. It is &s;ufficient to inform them, that it is what we mean by moral nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>I have already &s;hown that Dr. We&s;t grants the mutual oppo&s;ition of different propen&s;ions and volitions; it may be further ob&s;erved that, though he &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly di&s;|putes again&s;t the di&s;tinction between natural and moral nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;ays it is made without a difference; yet the &s;ame di&s;tinction is abundantly implied in his book, particularly in his third e&s;&s;ay. He there holds forth, that a man may have a <HI>phy&s;ical power</HI> to do an action, and yet <HI>not exert</HI> that power; that it may be <HI>certain,</HI> there may be <HI>a certainty,</HI> and it may be <HI>certainly foreknown,</HI> that a man will do &s;omething, which he has a <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> power not to do; p. 46. That a bare <HI>certainty,</HI> that an agent will do &s;uch a thing, does not imply, that he had not a power to refrain from doing it; p. 45. Now by moral nece&s;&s;ity we mean the previous certainty of any moral action. Therefore when Dr. We&s;t, p. 46, holds, <HI>that there may be a</HI> CERTAINTY, <HI>that a man will do &s;uch a thing, though he may have at the &s;ame time a phy&s;ical power of not doing it;</HI> he holds, that there may be the very thing which Pre&s;ident Edwards calls a <HI>moral ne|ce&s;&s;ity,</HI> that the man will do the thing, though he may have at the &s;ame time a <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> or <HI>natural</HI> power not to do it.&mdash;Thus Dr. We&s;t makes and abundantly in&s;i&s;ts on that very di&s;tinction, which he reprobates in Pre&s;ident Edwards, and which he declares to be made without any difference. Indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible for any man to write &s;en&s;ibly or plau&s;ibly on this &s;ubject, without going on the ground of this di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>It has been inquired concerning Pre&s;ident Edwards's moral inability, whether the man, who is the &s;ubject of it, <HI>can remove</HI> it? I an&s;wer, yes, he has the &s;ame phy&s;ical power to remove it and to do the action, which he is morally unable to do, which the man, concern|ing whom Dr. We&s;t &s;uppo&s;es there is a certainty, that he will not do an action, has to do the action
<PB N="19" REF="032073_0017_0FF1102676A99B48">
and &s;o to defeat or remove the &s;aid certainty. I agree with Dr. We&s;t, that he has a phy&s;ical power &s;o to do.</P>
<P>Perhaps after all &s;ome will in&s;i&s;t, that natural and moral nece&s;&s;ity are the &s;ame. It is ardently to be wi&s;h|ed, that &s;uch per&s;ons would tell us, in what re&s;pects they are the &s;ame. We have informed them, in what re&s;pects we hold them to be different. We wi&s;h them to be equally explicit and candid. If they mean, that natural and moral nece&s;&s;ity are the &s;ame in this re&s;pect, that they are or may be equally certain and fixed, and may equally en&s;ure their re&s;pective con&s;equences or effects; I grant it. Still they may be different in oth|er re&s;pects, particularly this, that natural nece&s;&s;ity re|&s;pects tho&s;e events or things only, which are not of a moral nature, while moral nece&s;&s;ity re&s;pects tho&s;e only, which are of a moral nature; and there may be an entire oppo&s;ition of will to the former, but not to the latter. If they mean, that they are the &s;ame as to vir|tue and vice, prai&s;e and blame, &amp;c. this is not grant|ed, and to a&s;&s;ert it, is a mere begging of the que&s;tion. If they mean, that both tho&s;e kinds of nece&s;&s;ity may ari&s;e from <HI>nature;</HI> meaning by this the fixed proper|ties of beings and the e&s;tabli&s;hed cour&s;e of things and events; this is granted. Still there may be the grounds of di&s;tinction before mentioned. If they &s;ay, that moral nece&s;&s;ity is <HI>natural</HI> nece&s;&s;ity, becau&s;e it is or may be <HI>born with us;</HI> I grant it. But this is mere quibbling on the word <HI>natural.</HI> Though volitions may be the effects of a bias of mind born with us, yet tho&s;e volitions are moral acts, and therefore the nece&s;&s;ity from which they proceed, is a <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity. A man born with a contracted, &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, &s;till has a phy&s;ical power to be benevolent, and it is not &s;uppo&s;|able, that his will or di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould be entirely op|po&s;ed to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, whenever he is the &s;ubject of it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. Of Liberty.</HEAD>
<P>DR. We&s;t &s;ays, p. 16,
<Q>By liberty we mean <HI>a power</HI> of acting, willing or choo&s;ing; and by <HI>a power</HI> of acting, we mean, that when all circum&s;tan|ces nece&s;&s;ary for action have taken place, the mind <HI>can</HI> act or <HI>not act.</HI></Q>
This is not explicit: There is an ambiguity in the words <HI>power, can, not act.</HI> If by <HI>pow|er</HI> and <HI>can,</HI> he mean <HI>natural</HI> power, as it has been ex|plained in the preceding chapter; I agree that in any given ca&s;e we have a power to act or decline the pro|po&s;ed action. A man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es liberty when he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a natural or phy&s;ical power to do an action, and is un|der no natural inability with re&s;pect to that action. The word liberty &s;ugge&s;ts a negative idea, and means the ab&s;ence of certain ob&s;tacles, confinement or re|&s;triction. A bird not, confined in a cage, but let loo&s;e in the open air, is free; a man not &s;hut up in pri&s;on, is in that re&s;pect, free; a &s;ervant delivered from the control of his ma&s;ter, is free; a man, who has di&s;engaged him|&s;elf from the tie of a civil bond, is in that re&s;pect free. In all the&s;e ca&s;es liberty implies &s;ome exemption, or &s;ome negation. In a moral &s;en&s;e and with re&s;pect to moral conduct, a man is free or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es liberty, when he is under no involuntary re&s;traint or compul&s;ion; <HI>i. e.</HI> when he is under no re&s;traint or compul&s;ion, to which his will does not con&s;ent, or to which it is or may be entirely oppo&s;ed. An exemption from this re&s;traint or compul&s;ion, is liberty, moral liberty, the liberty of a moral agent; and this is an exemption from natural nece&s;&s;ity and inability as before explained. He who is thus exempted, has a natural power of acting, ju&s;t &s;o far as this exemption extends. Even though
<Q>all cir|cum&s;tances nece&s;&s;ary for action, have taken place,</Q>
yet "then the mind can," in this &s;en&s;e, "act" in any
<PB N="21" REF="032073_0019_0FF11029C36A7F18">
particular manner, or decline that action. For in|&s;tance, when all circum&s;tances nece&s;&s;ary for Judas's betraying his Lord, had taken place, &s;till he had a nat|ural power either to betray him or not betray him. He was under no compul&s;ion to betray him, to which his will did not con&s;ent. He was not, nor could he po&s;&s;ibly be, under any &s;uch compul&s;ion to <HI>choo&s;e</HI> to betray him. It is a contradiction, that the mind &s;hould <HI>choo&s;e</HI> to do a thing <HI>involuntarily</HI> and with an entire oppo&s;ition of will.</P>
<P>If this be the liberty, for which Dr. We&s;t pleads, he has no ground of controver&s;y on this head, with Pre&s;ident Edwards, or with any who embrace his &s;y&s;|tem. There is nothing in this incon&s;i&s;tent with the influence of motives on the will, to produce volition; or with the dependence of volition on &s;ome cau&s;e ex|trin&s;ic to it&s;elf, extrin&s;ic to the power of will, or to the mind in which it exi&s;ts. What if motives do ex|cite to volition? What if the connection between motive and volition be &s;uch, that volition never takes place without motive, and always takes place, when a proper motive appears? What if volition be the effect of a cau&s;e extrin&s;ic to the will? Still it is true, that volition never takes place without the con&s;ent or with the entire oppo&s;ition of the will. The will or mind then is &s;till free, as it is exempted from natural nece&s;&s;ity and has a natural or phy&s;ical power to act otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that it is not &s;ufficient to liberty, that the mind act <HI>with</HI> its own con&s;ent, <HI>in the act it&s;elf;</HI> but it mu&s;t in every free act, act <HI>from</HI> its own con|&s;ent <HI>previous</HI> to the free act; I ob&s;erve, that this im|plies, that in order to any free act, there mu&s;t be an infinite &s;eries of free acts following one another. For in&s;tance, the objection &s;uppo&s;es, that if I now freely choo&s;e to write remarks on Dr. We&s;t, this free choice mu&s;t <HI>ari&s;e from</HI> a <HI>previous</HI> con&s;ent of my will, or from a previous choice, to write &s;uch remarks. Again, this previous choice, in order to be free, mu&s;t for
<PB N="22" REF="032073_0020_0FF1102CE1D59B18">
the &s;ame rea&s;on ari&s;e from another previous free choice; and &s;o on <HI>infinitely,</HI> which is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Or if it &s;hould be &s;aid, that liberty implies not on|ly an exemption from all <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> nece&s;&s;ity, but al&s;o an exemption from all <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity; then, as moral nece&s;&s;ity is nothing but a previous certainty of the exi&s;tence of any moral act, it will follow that any act, in order to be free, mu&s;t come into exi&s;t|ence without any previous certainty in the nature of things or in the divine mind, that it would exi&s;t; <HI>i. e.</HI> no act can be free, unle&s;s it come into exi&s;tence by <HI>pure contingence</HI> and <HI>mere chance.</HI></P>
<P>But let us proceed to con&s;ider what Dr. We&s;t &s;ays in further explanation of his idea of liberty.</P>
<P>"To act," &s;ays he,
<Q>to will or to choo&s;e, is to be free.</Q>
P. 16. If this be liberty, &s;urely Dr. We&s;t could not imagine, that Pre&s;ident Edwards, or any man in his &s;en&s;es, ever denied that we are free. It is to be pre&s;umed, that no man ever denied, that we deter|mine, that we will, or that we choo&s;e. However, though I allow all the&s;e things, yet I cannot allow, that this is a true account of liberty. Will Dr. We&s;t pretend, that we are never free, but when we are in action? That we have no liberty to determine, be|&s;ide when we do actually determine? That we have no liberty to will or choo&s;e, but when we are in the exerci&s;e of volition or choice? Will he &s;ay, that he him&s;elf had no liberty to determine to write e&s;&s;ays on liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, before he actually determin|ed to write them? Dr. We&s;t, in p. 46, holds that there may be a certainty, that a man will do an ac|tion; yet that he may have a phy&s;ical power of doing the contrary. He would therefore doubtle&s;s grant, that he is at liberty to do the contrary, though he ac|tually does it not; and this whether the action be external or mental. Be&s;ides; this definition of lib|erty is wholly incon&s;i&s;tent with the other favorite one of Dr. We&s;t, viz. <HI>a power to act or not.</HI> If liberty be a <HI>power,</HI> &s;urely it is not an <HI>action;</HI> but
<Q>to act, to
<PB N="23" REF="032073_0021_0FF1102F4A8A22A8">
will or to choo&s;e, is an action.</Q>
E&s;pecially if liberty be a power to <HI>not act,</HI> it cannot be <HI>an action.</HI> And if a power of acting, be action; a power of willing be volition; and a power of choo&s;ing be choice; then a power of walking or writing, and actual walking and writing is the &s;ame thing; and whoever, is able to write, and &s;o long as he is able, is actually employed in writing. Does Dr. We&s;t find by experience, that this is true?</P>
<P>I know there is a cla&s;s of divines, who have holden, that God is free to good only, becau&s;e he does good only; that the &s;aints and angels in heaven are for the &s;ame rea&s;on free to good only; that Adam in paradi&s;e was free to both good and evil; that unregenerate &s;inners and devils are free to evil only; and that the regenerate in the pre&s;ent life are free to both good and evil. But I pre&s;ume Dr. We&s;t would not choo&s;e to rank him&s;elf in this cla&s;s.</P>
<P>Dr. S. Clarke is equally incon&s;i&s;tent in his defini|tion of liberty, as Dr. We&s;t.
<Q>The whole e&s;&s;ence of liberty,</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q>con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>power</HI> of acting. <HI>Action</HI> and <HI>liberty</HI> are <HI>identical</HI> ideas: And the true <HI>definition</HI> of a free being, is one that is endued with a <HI>power</HI> of acting.</Q>
Remarks on Collins, p. 15. How true it is, that great men are not always wi&s;e! And how &s;urpri&s;ing, that Dr. Clarke, whom the advo|cates for &s;elf-determination, &s;et up as unequalled in metaphy&s;ical acutene&s;s, &s;hould contradict him&s;elf twice in four lines, in what required &s;o much accuracy, as the definition of liberty! 1. The whole e&s;&s;ence of lib|erty is here &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in a <HI>power</HI> of acting. 2. <HI>Ac|tion</HI> and liberty are &s;aid to be identical ideas; and therefore the <HI>power</HI> of action and liberty are not iden|tical ideas, unle&s;s the <HI>power</HI> of action and <HI>action</HI> are identical ideas. 3. The true definition of a free be|ing is &s;aid to be one that is endued with the <HI>power</HI> of acting. Thus the Doctor ends where he began, for|getful of the middle.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="032073_0022_0FF110614E9AF7C8">But that part of Dr. We&s;t's account of liberty, with which he &s;eems to be mo&s;t plea&s;ed, and on which he &s;eems mo&s;t to depend, remains yet to be con&s;idered. It is this, <HI>a power to act or not act,</HI> in all ca&s;es whatev|er. On this I ob&s;erve, that if by <HI>acting or not acting,</HI> the Doctor mean choo&s;ing or refu&s;ing, I grant, that we have a <HI>natural</HI> power to do either of the&s;e in any ca&s;e. But refu&s;ing is as real an act of the mind, as choo&s;ing, and therefore is very improperly called <HI>not acting.</HI> I grant, that we have a <HI>natural</HI> power to choo&s;e or refu&s;e in any ca&s;e; but we have no <HI>moral</HI> power, or power oppo&s;ed to <HI>moral nece&s;&s;ity:</HI> For mor|al nece&s;&s;ity is previous certainty of a moral action; and a power oppo&s;ed to this mu&s;t imply a previous uncertainty. But no event moral or natural is or can be uncertain previou&s;ly to its exi&s;tence.&mdash;But if by a power to act or not act, the Doctor mean a power either to choo&s;e an object propo&s;ed, or to refu&s;e it, or to do neither; this is an impo&s;&s;ibility. Whenever an object is propo&s;ed for our choice, if there be any me|dium between choo&s;ing and refu&s;ing, it is a &s;tate of perfect blocki&s;h inaction and in&s;en&s;ibility or <HI>torpor;</HI> and this inaction mu&s;t be <HI>involuntary;</HI> as a <HI>voluntary</HI> inaction implies an act or volition, which is incon&s;i&s;t|ent with perfect inaction. A voluntary &s;tate of inac|tion and torpor is a contradiction in terms: It implies, that the mind is the &s;ubject of no act at all, and yet at the &s;ame time is the &s;ubject of a volition, by which it con&s;ents to inaction. Or if it &s;hould be &s;aid, that a voluntary &s;tate of inaction means a &s;tate, to which the mind is indeed reduced by an act of volition, and that the volition having accompli&s;hed a &s;tate of inac|tion, cea&s;es it&s;elf to exi&s;t, and thus perfect and uni|ver&s;al inaction follows; I ob&s;erve, (1) That &s;till this plea does not rid the matter of the contradiction. The cau&s;e of the perfect inaction is a volition. This cau&s;e mu&s;t continue in exi&s;tence and in operation, till the effect is accompli&s;hed; <HI>i. e.</HI> till entire and perfect inaction has actually taken place. And yet &s;o long as
<PB N="25" REF="032073_0023_0FF11030DD2C27A8">
this cau&s;e continues to exi&s;t, it is a contradiction, that perfect and entire inaction &s;hould take place. (2) Be&s;ides this contradiction, if the mind could by an act of volition or by other means be reduced to a &s;tate of entire inaction and torpitude, this &s;tate would be utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the exerci&s;e of any liber|ty. The man in this &s;tate can no more exerci&s;e lib|erty, than if he were under ever &s;o great <HI>natural</HI> ne|ce&s;&s;ity, or than if he were turned into a &s;tock or &s;tone. During this &s;tate he cannot po&s;&s;ibly put forth any act, to arou&s;e him&s;elf from this <HI>torpor.</HI> It is in the power of no man, to reduce him&s;elf to this &s;tate, with re&s;pect to any object propo&s;ed to his choice; or when he is re|duced to it, to recover him&s;elf from it.</P>
<P>If to this it &s;hould be objected, that we are entire|ly indifferent with regard to many objects; we nei|ther choo&s;e nor refu&s;e them: I an&s;wer, be this as it may with re&s;pect to objects not propo&s;ed for our choice; it is not true with re&s;pect to tho&s;e, which are propo&s;ed for our choice; and this is all that I have a&s;&s;erted, and all that the &s;ubject requires me to a&s;&s;ert; for Dr. We&s;t's account of liberty is
<Q>a power of act|ing; and by a power of acting, we mean, that when all circum&s;tances nece&s;&s;ary for action have taken place, the mind can act or not act; <HI>i. e.</HI> when an occa&s;ion for volition, choice or determination, is pre|&s;ented; or when an object of choice, or an object, with re&s;pect to which we are to will or determine, is exhibited.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Locke's ob&s;ervations on this point are very pertinent and convincing: They are as follows;
<Q>A man in re&s;pect of willing, or the act of volition, when an action in his power is once propo&s;ed to his thoughts as pre&s;ently to be done, cannot be free. The rea&s;on whereof is manife&s;t &mdash; he cannot avoid willing the exi&s;tence or not exi&s;tence of that action; it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that he will the one or the other, <HI>i. e.</HI> prefer the one to the other, &s;ince one of them mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow; and that
<PB N="26" REF="032073_0024_0FF11033F6DCDC60">
which does follow, follows by the choice and deter|mination of his mind, that is, by his willing it. For if he did not will it, it would not be. So that in re|&s;pect of the act of willing, a man in &s;uch a ca&s;e is not free: Liberty con&s;i&s;ting in a power to act or not act, which in regard of volition, a man upon &s;uch a propo&s;al has not. For it is unavoidably nece&s;&s;ary to prefer the doing or forbearance of an action in a man's power, which is once propo&s;ed to a man's thoughts. A man mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily will the one or the other of them, upon which preference or voli|tion the action or its forbearance certainly follows and is truly voluntary. But the act of volition or preferring one of the two, being that, which he can|not avoid, a man in re&s;pect of that act of willing is under a nece&s;&s;ity.&mdash;This then is evident, that in all propo&s;als of pre&s;ent action, a man is not at liber|ty to will or not to will; becau&s;e he cannot forbear willing.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>A man that is walking, to whom it is propo&s;ed to give off walking, is not at liberty, whether he <HI>will</HI> determine him&s;elf to walk or give off walking, or no. <HI>He mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily prefer one or t'other of them,</HI> walking or not walking.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>The mind in that ca&s;e has not a power to forbear willing: It cannot avoid <HI>&s;ome</HI> determination.&mdash;It is man|ife&s;t, that it orders and directs one in preference to, or in the neglect of the other.</Q>
Dr. We&s;t him&s;elf gives up his favourite power of <HI>not acting,</HI> in the fol|lowing pa&s;&s;age:
<Q>As &s;oon as ideas are pre&s;ented to the mind its active faculty is exerted, and the mind continues con&s;tantly acting, as long as it has ideas, ju&s;t as the act of &s;eeing takes place the very in&s;tant the eye is turned to the light, and continues as long as the light &s;trikes the eye.</Q>
Part II. p. 9.
<Q>The mind is always acting.</Q>
P. 10. If it continue to act as long as it has ideas, as the eye continues to &s;ee as long as the light &s;trikes it; then the mind has no power of not acting, while it has ideas. And I think it will not be pretended that the mind has a power to
<PB N="27" REF="032073_0025_0FF1103583018800">
bani&s;h from it&s;elf, all ideas at plea&s;ure. This would be a <HI>torpor</HI> indeed! a torpor of the under&s;tanding as well as of the will! And if the mind be always acting, it never exerci&s;es the power of not acting.</P>
<P>Doctor We&s;t thinks it &s;trange, that his private cor|re&s;pondent does not know what the Doctor means by <HI>a power to act or not act;</HI> and the Doctor proceeds to give &s;everal in&s;tances of it, as of a man, who had been confined in pri&s;on, &s;et at liberty to go out or &s;till to tarry in pri&s;on; and of an hu&s;bandman, who has the offer of a farm, on certain conditions, and he is at lib|erty to take the farm or not. But neither of the&s;e is an in&s;tance of <HI>a power to act or not act;</HI> they are mere in&s;tances of a natural power to act differently, to act one way or another. If the man who has the offer to go out of the pri&s;on, choo&s;e to tarry in it; he as re|ally acts as if he had cho&s;en to go out. If the hu&s;|bandman choo&s;e to decline the farm offered him, this is as real and po&s;itive an act, as if he had cho&s;en to take it. And the Doctor, though he has attempt|ed to give an in&s;tance of a power to act or not act, has not given one. For this rea&s;on, as well as from the nature of the ca&s;e, I believe it is not in his power to give an in&s;tance of it. If it be in his power, I wi&s;h him to do it. He acknowledges this to be
<Q>the main point, on which the hinge of the whole contro|ver&s;y turns.</Q>
A power to act or not act, is his def|inition of that liberty, for which he contends, and in &s;upport of which he has written his two books. And if he be not able to give a &s;ingle in&s;tance of &s;uch a power, it is high time for him to give it up, and the whole controver&s;y, of which this is the hinge. No wonder Dr. We&s;t's corre&s;pondent did not under&s;tand what the Doctor meant by this power, if the Doctor him&s;elf did not under&s;tand it &s;o far as to be able to give an in&s;tance of it.&mdash;<HI>A power to act or not act</HI> mu&s;t either mean a power to choo&s;e or refu&s;e; or a power to act, or to cea&s;e from all action in either choo&s;ing or refu&s;ing. If the former be the meaning,
<PB N="28" REF="032073_0026_0FF11076BA2DDC20">
it is no more than we all grant, provided by power be meant <HI>natural</HI> power. But if in this ca&s;e <HI>moral</HI> pow|er be intended, a power oppo&s;ed to moral nece&s;&s;ity, which is the previous certainty of a moral action; this we utterly deny, becau&s;e it implies, that there is a pre|vious perfect uncertainty in the nature of things and in the divine mind, whether we &s;hall choo&s;e or refu&s;e the propo&s;ed object.&mdash;If the la&s;t be the meaning of <HI>a power to act or not act,</HI> as this is a power to &s;ink our|&s;elves into a &s;tate of unfeeling and blocki&s;h torpor, I ap|peal to the reader, whether Dr. We&s;t, or Limborch, or any other man, has ever had or can have any idea of &s;uch a power; or if they have, whether it would be any de&s;irable liberty, or would imply any qualification for moral agency.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that Dr. We&s;t tells us, that he has given a definition of "a power to act or not act," and that this definition is,
<Q>that there is no infallible con|nection between motive and volition.</Q>
But this, which he calls a definition, does not at all relieve the difficulty. If it mean, that when motives are pre&s;ent|ed, the per&s;on can comply with them, or can refu&s;e to comply, or can neither comply nor refu&s;e; I deny it, declare it to be an impo&s;&s;ibility, and call on Dr. We&s;t to &s;hew the po&s;&s;ibility of it. If when he &s;ays, there is no infallible connection between motive and volition, he mean, that the mind may act, whether in choo&s;ing or refu&s;ing, without motive; this is contrary to Dr. We&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Doctor, in p. 86 and 87, Part II, re&s;umes the que&s;tion of acting or not acting, and mentions &s;everal ca&s;es, which he con&s;iders as in&s;tances of not acting; <HI>e. g.</HI> when of two objects one is cho&s;en and the other not; when of the &s;pots on a che&s;s-board, A is touched and B not, &amp;c. But not one of the&s;e is a better in&s;tance of not acting, than there always is, when any one thing is cho&s;en and not another, or in preference to another. Suppo&s;e a man to offer a beggar a &s;hilling and a guinea, of which he may have
<PB N="29" REF="032073_0027_0FF11037FB846B70">
his choice, and he take the guinea; will it be &s;aid, that his leaving the &s;hilling is an in&s;tance of not act|ing? Then we never do any thing, without at the &s;ame time not acting; <HI>i. e.</HI> while we do one thing, we omit many other things, which we might do. If this be what Dr. We&s;t means by not acting, it is read|ily granted; but it comes to little or nothing; it is a mere power to do &s;ome things and to refu&s;e or omit &s;ome other things. This power is con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t infallible connection between motives and voli|tions. Whenever under the influence of motives, we do &s;ome things, we certainly have a power to do tho&s;e things, and to omit other things, which in fact we do not.</P>
<P>Dr. Clarke in his Remarks on Collins, p. 6, &s;ays,
<Q>All power of acting e&s;&s;entially implies, at the &s;ame time, <HI>a power</HI> of not acting: Otherwi&s;e it is not <HI>act|ing,</HI> but barely a <HI>being acted upon</HI> by that power, which cau&s;es the action.</Q>
If he mean by <HI>power, natural</HI> or <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> power, as before explained; and if by <HI>not acting</HI> he mean, <HI>refu&s;ing</HI> or <HI>voluntary forbearing</HI> to act in a certain propo&s;ed manner; I agree with Dr. Clarke. But if by <HI>power</HI> to act, he mean &s;omething oppo&s;|ed to moral nece&s;&s;ity or inability, which is a previ|ous certainty, that the action will or will not take place, in this ca&s;e power to act will be a previous uncer|tainty concerning the exi&s;tence of the action: And in this &s;en&s;e of the words, the Doctor's propo&s;ition, that a
<Q>power of acting e&s;&s;entially implies a power of not acting,</Q>
will amount to this merely, that a previ|ous uncertainty concerning the exi&s;tence of an action, e&s;&s;entially implies a previous uncertainty concerning the non-exi&s;tence of the &s;ame action: Which is mere trifling.&mdash;If the Doctor mean by <HI>not acting,</HI> entire inaction, I deny that a natural power to act implies a power to fall into entire inaction and torpitude. Nor does an uncertainty whether we &s;hall act in any par|ticular manner, imply an uncertainty whether we &s;hall be perfectly inactive and torpid.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="032073_0028_0FF1103A23F5FA78">Dr. We&s;t, &s;uppo&s;es <HI>&s;elf-determination</HI> is e&s;&s;ential to liberty; but his account of &s;elf-determination is equally inexplicit, as his account of liberty.

P. 17.&mdash;Now one would expect, that in all this profu&s;ion of words, in this variety of expre&s;&s;ion, with the help of three <HI>i. e</HI>'s. we &s;hould have a mo&s;t clear and explicit account of &s;elf-determination. But the account is entirely inexplicit, and equally con&s;i&s;tent with Pre&s;ident Edwards's &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity, as with the oppo&s;ite &s;cheme. He holds, that we our&s;elves determine; but he does not hold, that we are the ef|ficient cau&s;es of our own determinations. Nor can Dr. We&s;t con&s;i&s;tently hold this; as this would imply, that our determinations or volitions are effects, which Dr. We&s;t denies. Pre&s;ident Edwards holds, that we our&s;elves will or choo&s;e; that we our&s;elves act and are agents: But he does not hold, that we efficiently cau&s;e our own mental acts: Nor for the rea&s;on already given, can Dr. We&s;t con&s;i&s;tently hold this. Be&s;ides, this would imply, that
<Q>&s;elf acts on &s;elf and produces volition,</Q>
or that "the mind &s;ome how determines to will;" <HI>i. e.</HI> "wills to will, or choo&s;es to choo&s;e," which the Doctor renounces.

his &s;y&s;tem are ready to join i&s;&s;ue with Dr. We&s;t, on this point. Though we hold that our volitions are the effects of &s;ome extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, and that we are pa&s;&s;ive, as we are the &s;ubjects of the influence of that cau&s;e; yet we hold, that we are not <HI>merely</HI> pa&s;|&s;ive; but that volition is in its own nature an act or action, and in the exerci&s;e of it we are active, though in the cau&s;ation of it we are pa&s;&s;ive &s;o far as to be the &s;ubjects of the influence of the efficient cau&s;e. This we concede; and let our opponents make the mo&s;t of it: We fear not the con&s;equence. In this &s;en&s;e we hold,
<Q>that we are determiners in the active voice, and not <HI>merely</HI> determined in the pa&s;&s;ive voice.</Q>
We hold, that we are determiners in the active voice, in every &s;en&s;e which does not imply, that
<Q>&s;elf acts on &s;elf and produces volition; or that the mind &s;ome how wills to will, and choo&s;es to choo&s;e,</Q>
which Dr. We&s;t utterly denies; and
<Q>he entirely joins with Mr. Edwards in exploding the idea, that the will determines all the pre&s;ent acts of the will.</Q></P>
<P>Though we are determiners in the active voice, and not <HI>merely</HI> determined in the pa&s;&s;ive voice; yet our determination may be the con&s;equence of &s;uffi|cient motive or the effect of &s;ome other extrin&s;ic cau&s;e. We &s;ee, hear, feel, love and hate, in the ac|tive voice; yet we are or may be cau&s;ed to &s;ee, hear, &amp;c.

of the word, as they mean by action, <HI>&s;elf-determina|tion:</HI> But in&s;tead of taking it for granted, that this is the true &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>action,</HI> they ought to &s;how the reality and po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch an action, and re|move the ab&s;urdities, which are &s;aid to be in&s;epara|ble from it.&mdash;To &s;ay, that we are &s;elf-determined or &s;elf-moved, becau&s;e we our&s;elves determine and move, is as improper and groundle&s;s, as to &s;ay, that a body is &s;elf-moved and &s;elf-determined in its motion, becau&s;e the body it&s;elf moves.

<P>The Doctor puts the ca&s;e of his choo&s;ing coffee, when that, tea and chocolate were offered him, and all appeared equally eligible; and &s;ays,
<Q>I believe, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible in this and a multitude of &s;imi|lar in&s;tances, to a&s;&s;ign any accident or circum&s;tance, which determines the mind to its choice among things, which appear equally fit and eligible. Con&s;equently here is an undeniable proof of the liberty for which we contend.</Q>
The liberty for which he here con|tends, is a power to choo&s;e one of &s;everal equally eli|gible things. If by <HI>power</HI> he mean <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> power, I grant, that we have &s;uch a power to choo&s;e not only one of &s;everal things equally eligible, if any &s;uch there be, but one of things ever &s;o unequally el|igible, and to take the lea&s;t eligible. A man may be under no involuntary re&s;traint from taking an object ever &s;o ineligible. But if by power to choo&s;e one of &s;everal equally eligible things, he mean a power oppo&s;|ed to moral nece&s;&s;ity, it is a previous uncertainty which he will choo&s;e. But there is in this ca&s;e no more pre|vious uncertainty in the nature of things and in the divine mind, than in any ca&s;e whatever.</P>
<P>The Doctor denies, that
<Q>any accident or circum|&s;tance,</Q>
or any extrin&s;ic cau&s;e,
<Q>determines the mind to its choice among things which appear equally eli|gible.</Q>
If this were granted, though it is not, what would follow? Doubtle&s;s either that the choice is de|termined and cau&s;ed by the mind it&s;elf, or that it
<PB N="33" REF="032073_0031_0FF110648DE111F0">
comes into exi&s;tence without cau&s;e. But Dr. We&s;t cannot with con&s;i&s;tency hold either of the&s;e. To hold that choice or volition is cau&s;ed by the mind, is to hold, that it is an effect and has a cau&s;e, which Dr. We&s;t denies, and has written an e&s;&s;ay to prove it. It is al&s;o to hold, that
<Q>&s;elf acts on &s;elf and produces volition; or that the mind &s;ome how determines to will, <HI>i. e.</HI> wills to will or choo&s;es to choo&s;e, and that "the will determines the pre&s;ent acts of the will;" all which are denied by Dr. We&s;t.</Q>
On the other hand, that volition comes into exi&s;tence without cau&s;e, though this is maintained by the Doctor, in that he maintains, that "volition is no effect and has no cau&s;e;" yet it is al&s;o denied and renounced by him, in that he &s;ays, p. 27,
<Q>We cannot be charged with holding, that e|vents take place without cau&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>In p. 19, he &s;ays,
<Q>All who believe there is a De|ity, mu&s;t grant, that he has a &s;elf-determining power: For he being the fir&s;t cau&s;e, his volitions cannot be determined by any cau&s;e antecedent or extrin&s;ic to him&s;elf.</Q>
If by &s;elf-determining power here be meant, what Dr. We&s;t &s;ays he means <HI>&s;imply,</HI> That the Deity him&s;elf has a power to determine; that he him|&s;elf has a power to will or choo&s;e; we grant, that not only the Deity, but all intelligent beings have a &s;elf-determining power. A &s;elf-determining power accord|ing to this definition, is nothing but a power of will, which we all grant belongs to every intelligent and moral agent. Nor does this imply any thing incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the idea, that the Deity and all other intelli|gent beings are governed by motives, in the only &s;en&s;e in which we hold government by motives; which is, that the Deity does every thing which he does, be|cau&s;e there is a motive to do it, ari&s;ing from his own infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s.&mdash;But if by &s;elf deter|mining power, be meant a power by which God pro|duces volition in him&s;elf, by which
<Q>&s;elf acts on &s;elf and produces volition, we join with Dr. We&s;t in reprobating &s;uch a power.</Q>
He expre&s;sly &s;ays,
<Q>The
<PB N="34" REF="032073_0032_0FF10FFF62D6A7C8">
divine volitions are no effects produced by the Dei|ty.</Q>
P. 28.&mdash;If any thing el&s;e be meant, when|ever Dr. We&s;t will inform us what it is, (as we cannot imagine any be&s;ide one or other of the forementioned &s;en&s;es) we will inform him, whether we allow or deny it, and will give our rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>As to the argument, that
<Q>The Deity being the fir&s;t cau&s;e, his volitions cannot be determined by any cau&s;e antecedent or extrin&s;ic to him&s;elf; it may be an&s;wered, Still he may will as he does, becau&s;e of mo|tives and rea&s;ons ari&s;ing from his own infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s.</Q>
It may be further &s;aid, that the &s;ame argument, which Dr. We&s;t here u&s;es to prove, that God determines him&s;elf, will prove, that God created him&s;elf: Thus, All who believe that there is a Deity, mu&s;t grant, that he has a &s;elf-creating power and did create him&s;elf. For he being the fir&s;t cau&s;e, his exi&s;t|ence cannot be cau&s;ed by any thing antecedent or ex|trin&s;ic to him&s;elf. But it no more follows from the con&s;ideration, that God's <HI>volitions</HI> were not cau&s;ed by any thing antecedent or extrin&s;ic to God, that they were cau&s;ed by God, than from the con&s;ideration, that his <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> was not cau&s;ed by any thing antecedent or extrin&s;ic to him&s;elf, it follows, that it was cau&s;ed by him&s;elf. The truth is the divine volitions were no more cau&s;ed, whether by God him&s;elf or by any other cau&s;e, than the divine exi&s;tence was. The divine vo|litions are the divine holine&s;s uncreated and &s;elf-exi&s;t|ent. And one attribute of God is not more cau&s;ed or created, than all his attributes, or than his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>An exemption from extrin&s;ic cau&s;ality, in the acts of the mind, is e&s;&s;ential to Dr. We&s;t's idea of liberty. Suppo&s;e then, that a free volition is one that comes into exi&s;tence without any dependence on a cau&s;e ex|trin&s;ic to the mind, which is the &s;ubject of that voli|tion; the con&s;equence is, that either &s;uch a volition is cau&s;ed by the mind it&s;elf, and
<Q>&s;elf acts on &s;elf and produces volition; or it is ab&s;olutely without cau&s;e, and comes into exi&s;tence by mere chance; neither of
<PB N="35" REF="032073_0033_0FF11078535A1618">
which will Dr. We&s;t avow:</Q>
Indeed he has already expre&s;sly di&s;avowed them both. And if he either ex|pre&s;sly, or by nece&s;&s;ary implication, avows them both, that does not help the matter; to be incon&s;i&s;tent re|lieves no difficulty.</P>
<P>Liberty is by &s;ome writers di&s;tingui&s;hed into ex|ternal and internal. Internal or the liberty of the mind, is the principal &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent inquiry; and this, as is implied in what has been &s;aid already, con&s;i&s;ts in the power or faculty of will. Every intel|ligent being who has this power, is free, or has inter|nal liberty, and &s;o long as he retains this power, can|not be dive&s;ted of liberty. I am &s;en&s;ible, that our opponents &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;omething further, viz. a &s;elf-determining power is nece&s;&s;ary to liberty: And to this I &s;hall particularly attend in the next chapter. As internal liberty con&s;i&s;ts in the very faculty of the will, &s;o that which is external con&s;i&s;ts in opportunity externally to execute our determinations and wi&s;hes. To define internal moral liberty to be,
<Q>an opportu|nity and capacity of choo&s;ing and acting otherwi&s;e than the &s;ubject in fact does, is nothing di&s;tingui&s;h|ing between the &s;y&s;tem of tho&s;e who hold, that all moral actions are morally nece&s;&s;ary, and that of tho&s;e who deny it.</Q>
<Q>Opportunity and capacity of choo&s;|ing otherwi&s;e, may mean more <HI>natural</HI> power, as be|fore explained.</Q>
When Pharaoh cho&s;e to retain the Israelites, he was under no natural inability of choo&s;|ing to let them go. Still it was a matter of previous ab&s;olute certainty, that he would for a time refu&s;e to let them go, and had been divinely foretold.&mdash;If
<Q>opportunity and capacity of choo&s;ing otherwi&s;e, than the &s;ubject in fact does, mean any thing incon&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity, it mu&s;t mean a previous uncertainty how he will choo&s;e:</Q>
And if this be the meaning in the afore&s;aid definition of mor|al liberty; I deny that any man has in this &s;en&s;e op|portunity to choo&s;e otherwi&s;e than he does. Every event and con&s;equently every act of choice, is previ|ou&s;ly
<PB N="36" REF="032073_0034_0FF1107A2EBCA538">
foreknown by God and therefore is previou&s;ly certain: And to take it for granted, that any is pre|viou&s;ly to its exi&s;tence, uncertain in the divine mind and in reality, is an intolerable begging of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The following account has been given of liberty, as oppo&s;ed to moral nece&s;&s;ity:
<Q>I find I can ab&s;tain from any particular good; I can defer u&s;ing it; I can prefer &s;omething el&s;e to it; I can he&s;itate in my choice; in &s;hort, I am my own ma&s;ter to choo&s;e, or which is the &s;ame thing, I am <HI>free.</HI></Q>
Perhaps this is as popular a repre&s;entation of liberty and as agreeable to the ideas of tho&s;e who are the most zeal|ous advocates for liberty as oppo&s;ed to moral nece&s;&s;i|ty, as can be given.&mdash;But all this is talking in the dark and confounding the &s;ubject by the u&s;e of am|biguous words; particularly the word <HI>can.</HI> To &s;ay, "I <HI>can</HI> ab&s;tain from any particular good," is the very &s;ame as to &s;ay, I have <HI>power</HI> to ab&s;tain, &amp;c. But there are two &s;en&s;es to the words power and inability already noticed and explained. In one &s;en&s;e Pharaoh had power to let the I&s;raelites go; he was under no <HI>natural</HI> inability in the ca&s;e. Still there was an ab&s;o|lute previous certainty, that he would not for a time let them go. Therefore there was a moral nece&s;&s;ity, that he &s;hould not let them go, and he was morally unable to let them go; and in this &s;en&s;e he was not free; it was not a matter of uncertainty whether he would let them go or not.&mdash;This account of liber|ty reminds me of the argument, by which a certain man endeavoured to convince his neighbour, that there were no divine ab&s;olute decrees. The argument was, that having a child newly born, he felt him&s;elf at lib|erty to call it by what name he plea&s;ed, without re|gard to any divine decree. As if God had decreed, that he &s;hould call his child by a particular name, whether with or without his own con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Liberty or freedom mu&s;t mean freedom from &s;ome|thing. If it be a freedom from coaction or natural nece&s;&s;ity, this is what we mean by freedom. The
<PB N="37" REF="032073_0035_0FF1103C6E2314B8">
mind in volition is in its own nature free. But our opponents mean by freedom an exemption from all extrin&s;ic cau&s;al influence, and from all previous cer|tainty. And when they hold, that the mind cau&s;es its own volitions, they mu&s;t, to be con&s;i&s;tent, hold that it cau&s;es them contingently and without any previous certainty that it would cau&s;e them; and they mu&s;t deny that the mind's cau&s;ation of them is determined, fixed or limited by any cau&s;e whatever. For that the mind &s;hould cau&s;e them according to a previous e&s;|tabli&s;hment, would be as incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty, as that it &s;hould not cau&s;e them at all, as it implies an entire limitation of the mind in its operations.</P>
<P>The very inquiry, whether the mind in the exerci&s;e of the will, or as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power of will, be free, is apt to lead into error. It &s;eems to imply, that freedom is &s;omething el&s;e than the freedom of the will. To inquire whether the mind as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of will be free, is to inquire whether the mind as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of freedom be free; or whether freedom be freedom.</P>
<P>Men in general have no other idea of freedom, than a power of will, or an exemption from coaction or natural nece&s;&s;ity, as their language on the &s;ubject im|plies no more than this. With them to act <HI>freely,</HI> and to act <HI>voluntarily</HI> is the &s;ame thing, and they never once think of propagating one free act by an antecedent free act, or that in order to freedom it is requi&s;ite, that the acts of their wills &s;hould come to pa&s;s with|out cau&s;e and by mere chance: Nor do they once imagine, that in order to freedom, there mu&s;t be no previous certainty what their acts will be; or that the divine foreknowledge or prediction is incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty.</P>
<P>Liberty in the &s;en&s;e of our opponents, is not po&s;&s;i|ble or conceivable. By liberty they mean a power to cau&s;e all our own volitions, and to cau&s;e them free|ly. But that we &s;hould thus cau&s;e them, is neither po&s;&s;ible nor conceivable. If we &s;hould thus cau&s;e a volition, we &s;hould doubtle&s;s cau&s;e it by a cau&s;al act:
<PB N="38" REF="032073_0036_0FF1103FB5DE5820">
It is impo&s;&s;ible, that we cau&s;e any thing without a cau&s;al act. And as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that we cau&s;e it freely, the cau&s;al act mu&s;t be a <HI>free</HI> act, <HI>i. e.</HI> an act of the will or a volition. And as the &s;uppo&s;ition is, that all our volitions are cau&s;ed by our&s;elves, the cau&s;al volition mu&s;t be cau&s;ed by another, and &s;o on infi|nitely: Which is both impo&s;&s;ible and inconceivable. It is no more po&s;&s;ible or conceivable, that we &s;hould cau&s;e all our own volitions, than that all men &s;hould beget them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Some have &s;aid, that volition or voluntary exerci&s;e is <HI>liberty.</HI> It is undoubtedly a <HI>free act</HI> and liberty is a property of that act; but it is not more proper to call it <HI>liberty</HI> it&s;elf, than to call the apprehen&s;ion of the equality between the three angles of a triangle and two rights, <HI>intellect,</HI> becau&s;e it is an act of intellect. The flying of a bird at large in the open air is a <HI>free act,</HI> but not <HI>liberty</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Our opponents &s;ay, they plead for <HI>that liberty, in men to do as they plea&s;e.</HI> By this with re&s;pect to the mind, they mu&s;t mean, either that the mind cau&s;es its own volitions, or that it acts voluntarily. As to the fir&s;t, it has been in part con&s;idered already, and &s;hall be further attended to in the next chapter. The la&s;t is no more than we all allow; and for our opponents to mean this only, is to give up the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>It is generally if not univer&s;ally granted by our opponents, that God is <HI>nece&s;&s;arily holy;</HI> and to be &s;ure, the &s;cripture a&s;&s;ures us, that "he cannot lie," and "cannot deny him&s;elf." And Dr. We&s;t grants, that he is <HI>perfectly holy,</HI> p. 38; and that he is <HI>immutable,</HI> ibid. Therefore he is <HI>immutably</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> holy. Yet the Doctor &s;uppo&s;es God to po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;elf-deter|mining power. And although his <HI>definition</HI> of &s;elf-de|termination, as ob&s;erved before, is not at all incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the nece&s;&s;ity which we hold; yet it is mani|fe&s;t, that he &s;uppo&s;es &s;elf-determination to be incon|&s;i&s;tent with that nece&s;&s;ity. And did he mean, in a&s;cribing &s;elf-determination to the Deity, to a&s;cribe
<PB N="39" REF="032073_0037_0FF1109CAE72DA98">
&s;omething to him incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>immutable</HI> and <HI>nec|e&s;&s;ary</HI> holine&s;s? Does he believe, that it is not <HI>ab&s;o|lutely certain,</HI> that God will for ever continue to be holy? Yet ab&s;olute <HI>certainty,</HI> as I have often &s;aid, is all the nece&s;&s;ity for which we plead. The Doctor therefore has fallen into a dilemma, or rather a trilem|ma, and he may make his choice, whether to concede, that there is no &s;elf-determination in God, and that therefore it is not nece&s;&s;ary to liberty; or that &s;elf-determination is not at all incon&s;i&s;tent with ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity, and then he will give up the di&s;pute; or to hold that God is not nece&s;&s;arily holy, and that he <HI>can lie</HI> and <HI>can deny him&s;elf.</HI> I wait for the Doc|tor's deci&s;ion or explanation.</P>
<P>It is well known, that Dr. S. Clarke places liberty in &s;elf-determination or &s;elf-motion; and he holds, that
<Q>liberty in the highe&s;t and complete&s;t degree is in God him&s;elf;</Q>
and
<Q>that God is a mo&s;t perfect|ly free agent;</Q>
yet he immediately adds, that
<Q>he <HI>cannot but</HI> do always what is be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t in the whole. The rea&s;on is evident; becau&s;e perfect wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s are as <HI>&s;teady</HI> and <HI>certain</HI> prin|ciples of action, as <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> it&s;elf.</Q>
Perfect wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s therefore imply a <HI>certainty</HI> of action. But <HI>certainty</HI> is the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> in que&s;tion. How then can any liberty or &s;elf-determination incon&s;i&s;tent with ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity, coexi&s;t in the Deity with that nece&s;&s;ity?&mdash;Thus the mo&s;t able advocates for &s;elf-determination, and Dr. Clarke as much as any of them, are nece&s;&s;itated by their ab&s;urd and contradic|tory &s;y&s;tem, perpetually to contradict them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of our opponents hold, that we are the effi|cient cau&s;es of our own volitions, and that in this our liberty con&s;i&s;ts. But Dr. We&s;t expre&s;sly denies this with regard to the Deity; p. 28;
<Q>The divine vo|litions are no effects, either produced by the Deity, or by any extrin&s;ic cau&s;e.</Q>
Indeed that volitions are no effects of any cau&s;e, is a favourite and princi|pal doctrine of Dr. We&s;t. Therefore the &s;elf-deter|mination
<PB N="40" REF="032073_0038_0FF10FDE94B58768">
which he a&s;cribes to both God and man, produces no volition in either. What then does it? How does it contribute at all to liberty? In the De|ity it is con&s;i&s;tent with ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity, as we have ju&s;t &s;een; and what rea&s;on can be given, why it is not as con&s;i&s;tent with the like nece&s;&s;ity in man?</P>
<P>Or does liberty in God con&s;i&s;t in a contingence or previous uncertainty of his volitions? This, it is pre|&s;umed, will not be pretended; as it overthrows the divine immutability, and is directly contradictory to what our opponents, particularly Dr. Clarke and Dr. We&s;t&punc; hold&punc; of the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of God's moral perfections. And if liberty in God do not require &s;uch contin|gence and uncertainty, let a rea&s;on be given why it &s;hould in man.&mdash;We deny, that cau&s;ing our own volitions and acting by chance are either realities or po&s;&s;ibilities; but if they were both po&s;&s;ible and real; &s;ince they do not belong to the liberty of God, need we wi&s;h for any more liberty or higher kind of liberty and power, than God has? Or &s;hall we vainly imagine, that we po&s;&s;e&s;s it?</P>
<P>Liberty is no <HI>po&s;itive</HI> exi&s;tence. Exi&s;tence or be|ing is divided into <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> and <HI>mode.</HI> But liberty is certainly no <HI>&s;ub&s;tance.</HI> Modes are divided into ab|&s;olute or po&s;itive, and relative. Liberty, as it is a power, falls into the latter cla&s;s; it is a relative mode. All powers are relations or relative modes. It is then, as I &s;aid, no <HI>po&s;itive</HI> exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>I have long &s;ince thought, that this controver&s;y concerning <HI>liberty</HI> and nece&s;&s;ity, &s;o long agitated, might be ea&s;ily &s;ettled to mutual general &s;atisfaction, if the di&s;putants would but fully explain their own ideas of the &s;ubjects of the di&s;pute. But till this is done, what pro&s;pect or po&s;&s;ibility is there of &s;ettling it? Our opponents accu&s;e us of denying the liberty of moral agents. Now the truth or fal&s;ehood of this charge depends on the ideas they affix to the word <HI>liberty.</HI> If by <HI>liberty</HI> be meant what Law in his notes on King, p. 248, defines it to be,
<Q>A certain phy&s;ical
<PB N="41" REF="032073_0039_0FF10FD057A81F30">
indifference or indeterminatene&s;s in its own exer|ci&s;e; then we do deny liberty.</Q>
We deny that a man is or can be indifferent in the exerci&s;e of his liberty or his will.&mdash;Or if by liberty be meant, an exemption from all previous certainty, &s;o that it is a matter of uncertainty and mere chance, what our vo|litions are to be; in this &s;en&s;e al&s;o we deny liber|ty.&mdash;Further, if by liberty be meant, an exemption from all extrin&s;ic cau&s;ality or influence, &s;o that our volitions are efficiently cau&s;ed by our&s;elves; this al|&s;o we deny.&mdash;But if by liberty be meant a power of willing and choo&s;ing, an exemption from coaction and natural nece&s;&s;ity, and power, opportunity and advantage to execute our own choice; in this &s;en&s;e we hold liberty.</P>
<P>We wi&s;h our opponents to tell us with the &s;ame preci&s;ion, what <HI>they</HI> mean by liberty and in what &s;en&s;e they contend for it. Unle&s;s they do this, it &s;ignifies nothing for them to tell us, that we deny all liberty, and that they are contending for liberty again&s;t nece&s;|&s;ity; and as Dr. We&s;t has done, to give &s;uch gener|al and vague definitions of liberty, of &s;elf-determina|tion, &amp;c. as are perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with our ideas of liberty and free action.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. Of Self-Determination.</HEAD>
<P>LIBERTY and &s;elf-determination are &s;o blended by our opponents in this controver&s;y, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to write a chapter on one of the&s;e &s;ubjects, with proper attention to the &s;entiments of our oppo|nents, without running into the other. Therefore in the la&s;t chapter I was nece&s;&s;itated to &s;ay many things concerning &s;elf-determination. Yet I wi&s;h to make &s;ome further ob&s;ervations on the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>All our opponents agree, that &s;elf-determination is e&s;&s;ential to liberty. Let us fir&s;t attend to what Dr. We&s;t &s;ays on this &s;ubject; then we &s;hall make &s;ome remarks on what Dr. Clarke and others have &s;aid.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t tells us, that
<Q>determining, when we ap|ply it to the active faculty, is the &s;ame with volition. P. 16, 17.</Q>
And
<Q>the &s;en&s;e in which we u&s;e <HI>&s;elf-de|termination</HI> is &s;imply this, that we our&s;elves deter|mine; <HI>i. e.</HI> that we our&s;elves will or choo&s;e.</Q>
Now I cannot believe, that Dr. We&s;t imagined, that Pre&s;i|dent Edwards, or any of his followers, would deny, that we our&s;elves determine, will and choo&s;e. We doubt|le&s;s will and choo&s;e as really as we think, &s;ee, hear, feel, &amp;c. But who or what is the efficient cau&s;e in either ca&s;e, remains to be con&s;idered. To &s;ay, that we are determiners in the active voice, and not the deter|mined in the pa&s;&s;ive voice, gives no &s;atisfaction. We grant, that we are determiners in the active; and yet a&s;&s;ert, that we are determined, or are cau&s;ed to de|termine, by &s;ome extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, at the &s;ame time, and with re&s;pect to the &s;ame act: As when a man hears a &s;ound, he is the hearer in the active voice, and yet is cau&s;ed to hear the &s;ame &s;ound, by &s;omething ex|trin&s;ic to him&s;elf. It will not be pretended, that a man is the efficient cau&s;e of his own hearing, in every in|&s;tance in which he hears in the active voice.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="032073_0041_0FF10FE0750CE308">Though Dr. We&s;t in general maintains, and has written an e&s;&s;ay to prove, that volition is no effect and has no cau&s;e; yet he &s;ometimes forgets him&s;elf and falls in with the generality of the defenders of the &s;elf-determining power, who hold, that the mind is the efficient cau&s;e of its own volitions. He every where maintains, that volition is not the effect of an <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e? Why does he expre&s;s him&s;elf thus, if he do not &s;uppo&s;e it to be the effect of an <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e? The expre&s;&s;ion implies this. This is not all. In p. 24, he puts the que&s;tion,
<Q>whether the mind in choo&s;|ing or acting, do not modify it&s;elf?</Q>
which he an|&s;wers in the affirmative, and &s;ays, that this
<Q>modifi|cation is the effect of the mind willing or choo&s;|ing.</Q>
The mind then in willing modifies it&s;elf, <HI>i. e.</HI> brings it&s;elf into the mode of willing. This mode then is volition; and this volition is the effect of the mind willing, or the effect of volition. So that Dr. We&s;t here, in direct contradiction to his general doctrine, a&s;&s;erts, agreeably to Dr. Clarke and mo&s;t writers of his cla&s;s, that volition is an effect and has a cau&s;e; is the effect of the mind who&s;e volition it is, and is the effect of the mind willing or of a volition of that mind. Agreeably to this he &s;ays, p. 28,
<Q>No agent can bring any effects to pa&s;s, but what are <HI>con&s;equent</HI> upon his acting; <HI>i. e.</HI> that all effects are in con&s;equence of the activene&s;s or operativene&s;s of &s;ome being:</Q>
And p. 22,
<Q>No being can become a cau&s;e, <HI>i. e.</HI> an effi|cient, or that which produces an effect, but by FIRST <HI>operating, acting</HI> or <HI>energi&s;ing:</HI></Q>
And in the &s;ame page,
<Q>Volition, when u&s;ed intelligibly &mdash; is real|ly an efficient cau&s;e.</Q>
Volition then is an efficient cau&s;e, and an efficient cau&s;e of a modification of the mind, which is another volition, and this by <HI>fir&s;t</HI> op|erating, acting or energi&s;ing: And doubtle&s;s this ope|ration, act or energi&s;ing is a volition. So that here we have three volitions in train, all nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;t|ence of one volition and of every volition. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> volition is an efficient cau&s;e of a <HI>&s;econd,</HI> called by Dr.
<PB N="44" REF="032073_0042_0FF1109FB7756728">

<Q>&s;elf act|ing on &s;elf and producing volition, and this by the in&s;trumentality of an intermediate volition.</Q>
Dr. We&s;t cannot con&s;i&s;tently deny any of the&s;e ab&s;urdities of his &s;cheme. He cannot &s;ay, that one volition, as an efficient cau&s;e, does not produce a &s;econd; as he holds, that "the mind in willing modifies it&s;elf." But according to him volition is the mind willing. He al|&s;o holds, that the &s;aid
<Q>modification is the effect of the mind willing; <HI>i. e.</HI> by his own definition, the effect of volition; volition then is the <HI>efficient cau&s;e</HI> of the &s;aid modification.</Q>
That this modification is voli|tion he will not deny. Then we have one volition as an efficient cau&s;e, producing another volition as its effect. But he grants that
<Q>no being can produce an effect, but by <HI>fir&s;t&punc; acting</HI> or <HI>energi&s;ing.</HI></Q>
This gives us the intermediate volition.</P>

without cau&s;e. If it happen without cau&s;e, our re|flections could no more afford us an example of an effi|cient cau&s;e, than they would on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that it is the effect of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e. So that the Doctor's ar|gument nece&s;&s;arily implies, that volition is produced by the mind as the efficient cau&s;e. In the &s;econd quotation above, he &s;peaks of our being &s;elf-determined, as in di|rect oppo&s;ition to our volitions being effects of an ex|trin&s;ic cau&s;e. But there is no &s;uch oppo&s;ition unle&s;s by our being &s;elf-determined be meant, that our volitions are the effects of an intrin&s;ic cau&s;e.

So that there appears to be no meaning in this pa&s;|&s;age, unle&s;s, in direct contradiction to what Dr. We&s;t el&s;ewhere holds, it mean, that our volitions are <HI>effects</HI> and have an <HI>efficient cau&s;e;</HI> that this cau&s;e is our own mind; and this efficient cau&s;e, as the Dr. declares all efficient cau&s;es do, produces its effect,

<Q>con&s;cious, that we our&s;elves are the determiners, and not the determin|ed,</Q>
we &s;hould thence derive no
<Q>idea of our inde|pendence in willing and choo&s;ing, if our willing and choo&s;ing either were the effect of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, or happened without cau&s;e; or unle&s;s we were the ef|ficient cau&s;es of our own willing and choo&s;ing.</Q></P>
<P>Though all this is abundantly denied and renounc|ed by Dr. We&s;t, as appears by quotations already made; yet it is the real ground work of his book, and the only ground, on which he could con&s;i&s;tently oppo&s;e the doctrine of moral nece&s;&s;ity and extrin&s;ic cau&s;ality of volitions: And this is the common doc|trine of the advocates for &s;elf-determination. Thus Dr. Clarke, in Papers between him and Leibnitz, p. 289, tells us,
<Q>The true and only que&s;tion concern|ing
<PB N="46" REF="032073_0044_0FF1104146BE6120">
liberty, is, whether the immediate phy&s;ical cau&s;e or principle of action be indeed in him, whom we call the agent; or whether it be &s;ome other rea&s;on &s;ufficient, which is the real cau&s;e of the action, by operating upon the agent and making him to be, not the agent but a mere patient.</Q>
I under&s;tand the Doctor by phy&s;ical cau&s;e, to mean efficient, pro|ducing cau&s;e; otherwi&s;e it is not to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Dr. Chauncy is &s;till more explicit.
<Q>Self-deter|mination <HI>gives ri&s;e</HI> to our volitions &mdash; and is the cau&s;e of them.</Q>
<HI>Benevolence of the Deity,</HI> p. 128.
<Q>A power in man, that &s;ubjects <HI>his volitions to his command,</HI> is the only bottom, upon which agency can be founded.</Q>
Ibid, p. 129. And in the next page he &s;ays, the &s;ame power
<Q>con&s;titutes us agents, or beings that are <HI>efficiently the cau&s;es</HI> of their own volitions.</Q></P>
<P>Now this &s;elf-determination, which "gives ri&s;e to our volitions," and in which we are
<Q>the efficient cau&s;es of our own volitions, is a determination or act either of the will, or of &s;ome other faculty.</Q>
If it be an act of the will, it is a volition. So that here we have one volition cau&s;ed by another: And as the doctrine is, that all our volitions are the effect of &s;elf-determination, they are all the effect of volition, the cau&s;ing act the effect of a preceding act, and the fir&s;t the effect of one before that. This ab&s;urdity attend|ing the &s;cheme of &s;elf-determination, has been long &s;ince pointed out; nor have the advocates of that &s;cheme been able to &s;how, that their &s;cheme does not really labour under that ab&s;urdity, if by that &s;elf-de|termination, which is the cau&s;e of volition, they mean an act of the will.</P>
<P>But if this &s;elf-determination be an act of the un|der&s;tanding; then it &s;eems, that the will or mind wil|ling, is influenced to volition by a dictate of the un|der&s;tanding, or by a motive. Then we are at once involved in what is &s;o hideous to Dr. We&s;t, and all other believers in &s;elf-determination, the government
<PB N="47" REF="032073_0045_0FF110A2089451D0">
by motives and the moral nece&s;&s;ity implied in it: Al&s;o our volitions are determined by extrin&s;ic cau&s;es and we are the pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubjects of the operation of tho&s;e cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Or if we &s;uppo&s;e the determining act to proceed from any other faculty, if other there be, the difficulty will re|main. Dr. We&s;t holds,
<Q>that there are three e&s;&s;en|tial faculties of the mind, which ought always to be con&s;idered di&s;tinctly; and the&s;e are <HI>perception, pro|pen&s;ion</HI> and <HI>will</HI>;</Q>
and that
<Q>the la&s;t only is prop|erly the active faculty.</Q>
Then doubtle&s;s that &s;elf-determination, which is an <HI>action,</HI> and which gives ri&s;e to volition, is an act of this active faculty. In this ca&s;e we have will putting forth &s;elf-determin|ation, in order to give ri&s;e to volition; as we had be|fore volition as an efficient cau&s;e, fir&s;t operating, act|ing or energi&s;ing, in order to produce the effect vo|lition. As the will is, according to the Doctor,
<Q>the only active faculty, he will not pretend, that voli|tion produced by &s;elf-determination, is the effect of either of the other two faculties, as he reckons them, perception and propen&s;ion.</Q>
If he &s;hould &s;ay, that it is the effect of <HI>perception;</HI> this it &s;eems is a pa&s;&s;ive faculty; and then &s;elf-determination and all volition are the effects of a pa&s;&s;ive faculty and of pa&s;&s;ion, of which alone that faculty is by the terms capable; and therefore, it &s;eems, &s;elf-determination and volition mu&s;t them&s;elves be pa&s;&s;ions or mere impre&s;&s;ions, and we are pa&s;&s;ive in them. Be&s;ides, perception con&s;id|ered as a faculty, as Dr. We&s;t &s;ingularly con&s;iders it, appears to be nothing el&s;e, than intellect or the pow|er of under&s;tanding. And if &s;elf-determination pro|ceed from this, the con&s;equence is, that the will is governed by the under&s;tanding and by the dictates and motives which it &s;ugge&s;ts; which brings us where we were before, into the mid&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity. The &s;ame con&s;equence will follow, if we &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;elf-deter|mination proceed from <HI>perception</HI> in the common &s;en&s;e of the word, meaning <HI>an act</HI> of the under&s;tand|ing.
<PB N="48" REF="032073_0046_0FF11001AE1BECB0">
&mdash;If Dr. We&s;t &s;ay, that &s;elf-determination pro|ceeds from <HI>propen&s;ion;</HI> then he entirely coincides with Pre&s;ident Edwards, who a&s;cribes a great part of our volitions to di&s;po&s;ition, inclination, pa&s;&s;ion and habit, meaning certain bia&s;es of the mind di&s;tinct from volition and prior to it.&mdash;Be&s;ides; as propen|&s;ion is according to the Doctor a pa&s;&s;ive faculty, if volition and &s;elf-determination proceed from this they are pa&s;&s;ions or impre&s;&s;ions, they proceed from an ex|trin&s;ic cau&s;e and we are pa&s;&s;ive in them.</P>
<P>The cau&s;ing of one act of volition by another is attended with this ab&s;urdity al&s;o, it &s;uppo&s;es the cau&s;|ing act in this ca&s;e to be di&s;tinct from the act cau&s;ed; when in reality they coale&s;ce and are one and the &s;ame. For in&s;tance, to choo&s;e to have a choice of virtue, is nothing but a choice of virtue; to choo&s;e the choice of an apple, is to choo&s;e an apple: So that we have the volition before we have it, and in order that we may have it.</P>
<P>Some &s;en&s;ible of the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing, that the mind determines one volition by another, as this runs into an infinite &s;eries of volitions, and im|plies that there is volition before the fir&s;t volition, have renounced this idea of &s;elf-determination. A|mong the&s;e we may reckon Dr. We&s;t. But at the &s;ame time he gives up &s;elf-determination in every &s;en&s;e in which we di&s;pute it, and in every &s;en&s;e incon|&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity. This has been already illu&s;trated.&mdash;Others, to avoid the &s;ame difficulty expre&s;s them&s;elves differently: They profe&s;s to mean, that volition is cau&s;ed not by a pre|ceding volition, but by <HI>the man</HI> or <HI>the mind,</HI> who&s;e volition it is. But this gives no &s;atisfaction. Sup|po&s;ing it &s;hould be &s;aid, that a certain carpenter him|&s;elf was the efficient cau&s;e or builder of &s;uch a &s;hip; and it &s;hould be thence inferred, that he built it by working, labouring or exerting him&s;elf to the end of building the &s;hip; would not this be a natural and a nece&s;&s;ary inference? Would not the man, who &s;hould
<PB N="49" REF="032073_0047_0FF11066D41BB868">
a&s;&s;ert, that the carpenter did indeed him&s;elf immedi|ately build the &s;hip, but not by any labour or exertion, whether of body or mind, be univer&s;ally con&s;idered as talking ab&s;urdly and contradictorily? And does not the man talk as ab&s;urdly and contradictorily, who a&s;&s;erts, that a man is the efficient cau&s;e of his own volition, yet puts forth no exertion, in order to cau&s;e it? If any other way of efficiently cau&s;ing an effect, than by act or exertion previous to the effect, be po&s;|&s;ible or conceivable, let it be pointed out: Till this be done, we who conceive &s;uch a way to be impo&s;&s;i|ble and inconceivable, have a right to &s;ay &s;o, and to pre&s;ume, that our opponents, who a&s;&s;ert that there is &s;uch a way, are unable to point it out, and have no more idea of it, than we have. If upon trial, they &s;hall find, that they are unable to point out the way, let them hone&s;tly confe&s;s, that all they mean by &s;elf-determination is what we and all allow, that they are the <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of volition, and as Dr. We&s;t expre&s;&s;es it, that <HI>they them&s;elves will and choo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I perfectly agree with Dr. We&s;t when he &s;ays, p. 22,
<Q>No being can become an efficient cau&s;e, but by FIRST <HI>operating, acting</HI> or <HI>energi&s;ing.</HI></Q>
Operation, act or energi&s;ing is as much pre&s;uppo&s;ed in order to an effect, as an efficient cau&s;e is pre&s;uppo&s;ed in order to it. To &s;uppo&s;e an efficient cau&s;e to produce an effect without any act by which he produces it, is the &s;ame as to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame cau&s;e produces the effect, without any <HI>efficiency:</HI> It is as ab&s;urd, as it would be to &s;uppo&s;e, that Dr. We&s;t wrote his e&s;&s;ays without any exertion in order to the production of them, or that God created the world, without any creating act. If this be not true, let the fal&s;ehood of it be made to appear. Let any man &s;how, that an effect cannot as well come to pa&s;s without an efficient cau&s;e, as without a cau&s;|ing act; and that the world could not as well have come into exi&s;tence without a Creator, as without a creating act.</P>

<P>That we have a power of will or of determining is granted on all hands: But that we &s;hould effi|ciently cau&s;e our power of will, to put forth a voli|tion, without exerting any efficiency to this effect; only wants proof to make it credible, and explanation to make it intelligible or conceivable. Merely the circum&s;tance, that we have a power to will and de|termine, no more proves, that without motive or any influence from without; and without any cau&s;ing act within, we cau&s;e that power to exert it&s;elf; than the circum&s;tance, that we have a power of hearing proves, that without any pul&s;ation in the air, any cau&s;ation

from without or from within, we cau&s;e our&s;elves to hear a particular &s;ound.</P>
<P>Some others, as well as Dr. We&s;t, have denied, that by &s;elf-determination they mean the cau&s;ing of one act of the will by another. We have no objection to their denying this: But then we wi&s;h them to inform us explicitly, what they do mean. If they have any meaning they doubtle&s;s can expre&s;s it intelligibly&punc; And &s;o long as they do not expre&s;s a meaning differ|ent from what we mean by willing or choo&s;ing; and &s;o long as their definitions of &s;elf-determination ex|pre&s;s, either bare vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tion, or the cau&s;ing of one voli|tion by another, though they in&s;i&s;t, that they mean &s;omething different from either of the&s;e; I leave the reader to judge, whether they have any clear mean|ing to that word at all.</P>
<P>In conver&s;ation once with a gentleman of eminence among the advocates for &s;elf-determination he told me, that Pre&s;ident Edwards had abu&s;ed tho&s;e who write in favour of &s;elf-determination, in repre&s;enting them as holding, that the mind cau&s;es one act of volition by another. On my inquiring of the gentleman what then they did mean; his an&s;wer was, "They mean, that in determining the mind determines." Whether this an|&s;wer at all explained the matter; or whether it con|vey any other idea, than that <HI>the mind does determine, and has a volition,</HI> without touching the que&s;tion con|cerning the cau&s;e, extrin&s;ic or intrin&s;ic; I &s;ubmit to the reader. If a man &s;hould &s;ay, that in walking, he walks; in writing he writes; in hearing he hears; it is pre&s;umed, that no man could certainly hence con|clude, that the &s;peaker meant, that he was not influ|enced to walk or write, by motive or by &s;ome extrin|&s;ic cau&s;e; or that his hearing was &s;elf-determined.</P>
<P>If we cau&s;e our own volitions at all, we cau&s;e them either by a previous volition, or without &s;uch volition. If we cau&s;e them by a previous volition, this is what I have been particularly con&s;idering, and &s;hall &s;ay no more upon it. If we cau&s;e them without &s;uch voli|tion,
<PB N="52" REF="032073_0050_0FF10FECE8314E80">
we cau&s;e them involuntarily, without any de&s;ign, any motive or agents. Now I wi&s;h it may be inquir|ed, whether &s;uch a cau&s;ation of volition as this, if it be po&s;&s;ible or conceivable, as I contend it is not, be at all more favourable to liberty, than that volition &s;hould proceed from the influence of motive or &s;ome other extrin&s;ic cau&s;e; and whether it would be any advantage or privilege in any re&s;pect; and whether it would not be a great di&s;advantage and calamity to mankind, and an in&s;upportable incumbrance on the influence of rea&s;on, revelation, virtue, duty and hap|pine&s;s both here and hereafter. For whatever any of the&s;e may dictate, and with whatever motives they en|force tho&s;e dictates; whatever virtue and our own happine&s;s may require, &s;ince the &s;elf-determining pow|er is not influenced by the&s;e or any other motives; and &s;ince, as Dr. Clarke &s;ays,
<Q>There is no connec|tion at all between the perception of the under&s;tand|ing and the exertion of the active faculty; all tho&s;e dictates and motives would be in vain; the &s;elf-deter|mining power is a &s;overeign, ungovernable principle, perfectly deaf and unmoved by any motive, rea&s;on, argument or repre&s;entation whether of duty or inter|e&s;t.</Q>
It therefore de&s;troys the very u&s;e not only of our rea&s;on, of revelation and of the motives of both; but of our affections, pa&s;&s;ions, appetites and &s;en&s;es, in every part of our conduct as moral agents. For &s;o far as we are influenced by any of the&s;e, we are not &s;elf-determined, and therefore, according to our oppo|nents, we are incapable of moral action; and e&s;pecial|ly are we not &s;elf-determined in the &s;en&s;e now partic|ularly under con&s;ideration; cau&s;ing our own volitions involuntarily and without a previous volition.</P>
<P>Self-determination uninfluenced by motive, is in|con&s;i&s;tent with all religion and morality and with all virtue and vice. To love God without motive, prin|ciple, aim or end, is no religion. To love and do good to mankind in like manner, is no virtue. To hate God or mankind in like manner, is no irrelig|ion
<PB N="53" REF="032073_0051_0FF10FEF47C14E48">
or vice. Ju&s;t &s;o as to &s;tealing, robbing, kill|ing, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The &s;elf-determining power is, as I &s;aid, an ungov|ernable principle. It not only cannot be governed by rea&s;on, revelation, &amp;c. But not by any laws human or divine; for the&s;e are only motives. Nay, it can|not be governed by God, his providence or his grace. To be governed by either of the&s;e would be to be governed by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, and under &s;uch gov|ernment men would be pa&s;&s;ive. If God in his provi|dence govern and control them and their actions, they are limited, and act only by permi&s;&s;ion, and have no power to act or not act, no liberty to either &s;ide, but are confined to one &s;ide. Where then is &s;elf-determina|tion?&mdash;On the other hand, if men determine and control all their own actions, none of their actions are controlled by God.</P>
<P>Dr. Reid, a late &s;trenuous advocate for &s;elf-deter|mination &s;ays,
<Q>The name of a cau&s;e and of an agent, is properly given to that being only, which by its active power, produces &s;ome change in it&s;elf, or in &s;ome other being. The change, whether it be of thought, of will, or of motion, is the effect. Active power therefore is a quality in the cau&s;e, which en|ables it to produce the effect. And the <HI>exertion of that active power</HI> in producing the effect, is called action, agency, efficiency. In order to the produc|tion of any effect, there mu&s;t be in the cau&s;e, <HI>not on|ly power,</HI> but the <HI>exertion</HI> of that power: For power that is not exerted produces no effect.</Q>
E&s;&s;ays on the Active Powers, p. 259. Therefore if we be the efficient cau&s;es of our own volitions, as Dr. Clarke, Dr. Chauncy, &amp;c. held, we mu&s;t not only have <HI>a power</HI> to produce them, but there mu&s;t be an <HI>exertion</HI> of power in order to the production of volition. This exertion is doubtle&s;s an exertion of the will. Thus we run into the infinite &s;eries &s;everal times mentioned. And however others attempt to evade the ab&s;urdities
<PB N="54" REF="032073_0052_0FF10FD5029E0758">
of this infinite &s;eries, Dr. Ried and his followers mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ll into them.</P>
<P>"All our power," &s;ays Dr. Reid, ibid, 299,
<Q>is direct|ed by our will; we can form no conception of power, properly &s;o called, that is not under the direction of our will.</Q>
Then we have no power to direct or de|termine our will, unle&s;s we go round in a circle. If our will direct <HI>all</HI> our power, as the Doctor a&s;&s;erts; and our &s;elf-determining power direct and determine our will, then we go round in a circle, our will direct|ing all our power, and our &s;elf-determining power di|recting our will. Glorious liberty this! And this mu&s;t be an age of glorious improvement and illumi|nation, or we &s;hould never have made &s;uch di&s;cove|ries as the&s;e! Yet Dr. Reid had great rea&s;on to &s;ay, that all our power is directed by our will, otherwi&s;e &s;ome of our power might act involuntarily and our &s;elf-determining power (if we have any) might direct and govern us without our con&s;ent; with which Dr. Reid's &s;cheme would very ill agree. Still the Doctor in this gives up a point, which he had before po&s;itive|ly a&s;&s;erted and had laboured hard to e&s;tabli&s;h, "that if the will be not, "nothing el&s;e is, in our pow|er;" p. 258. Now if the will be in our power, it is under our direction, or is directed by our power. So that we have the circle complete; all "our power is directed by our will;" and yet our will is directed by our power. Into what glaring in|con&s;i&s;tences will not men run, rather than give up a favourite and indefen&s;ible hypothe&s;is! Yet they are &s;o blinded by their attachment to that hypothe&s;is, that they &s;ee no incon&s;i&s;tency attending it.&mdash;The truth is, that both the&s;e principles, <HI>that all our power is direct|ed by our will;</HI> and that <HI>our will is directed by our &s;elf-determining power,</HI> are e&s;&s;ential to the Doctor's &s;cheme, and to the &s;cheme of all who hold a &s;elf-determining power. To reconcile the&s;e two principles deeply con|cerns them. But they have never yet been able to do it; nor, it is pre&s;umed, ever will be able.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="032073_0053_0FF1108045780640">Some of the writers in favour of &s;elf-determination &s;eem to be &s;en&s;ible of the <HI>my&s;tery</HI> in it; particularly Dr. Chauncy. "It is readily allowed," &s;ays he,
<Q>lib|erty in man, in oppo&s;ition to nece&s;&s;ity, is one of <HI>the great wonders of God.</HI> The power in our nature, that con&s;titutes us free agents, is an <HI>amazing</HI> contriv|ance of infinite wi&s;dom. The modus of its opera|tion is <HI>too great a deep</HI> for us to fathom. It has <HI>tri|ed</HI> and <HI>puzzled</HI> the greate&s;t geniu&s;es in all parts of the world.</Q>
<HI>Benevolence of the Deity,</HI> p. 135. No wonder then, that nobody has ever been able to give a con&s;i&s;tent or intelligible account of this power. So long as tho&s;e who believe in it, are puzzled with it, we may expect, that their accounts of it will be con|fu&s;ed, unintelligible and contradictory. But the ac|count of no one of them appears to be more contra|dictory than that of Dr. We&s;t. He gives up the idea of Dr. Clarke and Dr. Chauncy, that the mind is the efficient cau&s;e of its own volitions; yet he falls into the &s;ame, in holding, that the mind in willing modifies it&s;elf, and that this modification is <HI>the effect</HI> of the mind willing, p. 24; and that we are independent in will|ing, p. 25. He holds that volition has no cau&s;e; yet holds, that the modification made of the mind by it|&s;elf in willing, is <HI>the effect</HI> of the mind willing. He holds that volitions have no cau&s;e; yet denies, that he can be ju&s;tly charged with holding, that events take place without a cau&s;e; p. 27. Surely the Doctor can never expect, that his unbia&s;ed readers will re|ceive his &s;y&s;tem, until he &s;hall have removed the&s;e incon&s;i&s;tences.</P>
<P>Archbi&s;hop King is gro&s;sly incon&s;i&s;tent with him|&s;elf, in holding, that the will determines it&s;elf to choo&s;e certain objects, without the influence of motive or any cau&s;e out of the will; and yet holding, that the will is determined to choo&s;e tho&s;e objects, becau&s;e of the plea&s;ure which will be in con&s;equence of that choice. Law's <HI>edition,</HI> p. 276. In &s;uch a ca&s;e the will is as much determined by motive, as if a man
<PB N="56" REF="032073_0054_0FF10FD7624FEB98">
were determined to go to a debauch, in the pro&s;pect of the &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, which he expected there.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t &s;ays, p. 23,
<Q>Every effect is wholly pa&s;|&s;ive with regard to the cau&s;e, which produces it.</Q>
And this equally holds, whether the cau&s;e be extrin|&s;ic or intrin&s;ic.
<Q>Con&s;equently, if human volition be an effect</Q>
even of an intrin&s;ic cau&s;e,
<Q>the man mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ive in willing. But if man be pa&s;&s;ive in willing, he can be active in nothing el&s;e; <HI>i. e.</HI> he is no agent, but a mere pa&s;&s;ive machine.</Q>
What then is the great advantage, which the advocates for &s;elf-determining power and the intrin&s;ic cau&s;ation of volition, would gain, could they e&s;tabli&s;h their favour|ite doctrine? According to their own &s;cheme, every volition would be an <HI>effect,</HI> a <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> effect, and
<Q>man mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ive in willing. But if man be pa&s;&s;ive in willing, he can be active in nothing el&s;e: <HI>i. e.</HI> he is no agent, but a mere pa&s;&s;ive machine.</Q>
Ibid. More than this cannot be &s;aid on this head, if we &s;up|po&s;e volition to be the effect of an <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e. Therefore they are gro&s;sly incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves in rejecting one of two hypothe&s;es, on account of &s;up|po&s;ed ab&s;urdities, which equally attend the other, and yet retaining that other.</P>
<P>Although Dr. Clarke and others a&s;&s;ert, that the true and only que&s;tion concerning liberty, is, whether we be the efficient cau&s;es of our own volitions; yet they them&s;elves would not abide by this conce&s;&s;ion. For if it were previou&s;ly fixed and e&s;tabli&s;hed, what par|ticular volitions we &s;hould efficiently cau&s;e in our|&s;elves, this would be as incon&s;i&s;tent with their ideas of liberty, as the &s;uppo&s;ition, that they are produced by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e. Gentlemen of that cla&s;s uni|ver&s;ally hold, that ab&s;olute decrees are incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty, becau&s;e they e&s;tabli&s;h the actions decreed. Therefore if God have decreed that we our&s;elves &s;hall efficiently cau&s;e &s;uch and &s;uch volitions in our own minds; this as effectually e&s;tabli&s;hes and &s;ecures the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e volitions, as if he had decreed,
<PB N="57" REF="032073_0055_0FF110A3FB61F338">
that they &s;hould be effected by any other cau&s;e. Therefore not only does their idea of liberty require &s;elf-determination, but it equally requires perfect pre|vious uncertainty and chance, and an entire exemp|tion from all rule, limitation or confinement, &s;o that the mind not only produces its own volitions; but produces them at random and by mere chance, with|out the influence of motive and without any previous certainty, what particular acts it &s;hall produce, and whether any. Thus according to them &s;elf-determin|ation is acting by chance and becoming the &s;ubject of volitions without any proper cau&s;e at all: For a cau&s;e that acts by chance and &s;tupidly, without motive or de&s;ign, is no proper efficient cau&s;e at all.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t &s;ays, p. 17,
<Q>We have &s;et a&s;ide the no|tion, that the will determines all the pre&s;ent acts of the will: For we entirely join with Mr. Edwards in exploding that idea.</Q>
What my&s;tery there may be couched under the <HI>will,</HI> I will not pretend to &s;ay. But as he
<Q>entirely agrees with Mr. Edwards in ex|ploding that idea, Dr. We&s;t mu&s;t hold not only, that the will as a di&s;tinct power of the mind does not determine the pre&s;ent acts of the will; but that the <HI>mind</HI> in the exerci&s;e of the power of will, does not determine tho&s;e acts.</Q>
For this is equally exploded by Mr. Edwards, as the other. The Doctor &s;ays, that
<Q>the will does not determine <HI>all</HI> the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> acts of the will.</Q>
But does it determine <HI>any</HI> of the acts of the will, whether <HI>pre&s;ent, pa&s;t</HI> or <HI>future?</HI> As he agrees in this particular with Mr. Edwards, he mu&s;t an&s;wer in the negative. All <HI>pa&s;t</HI> acts of the will were once pre&s;ent; and when they were pre&s;ent Dr. We&s;t denies, that the will determined them: And he will not &s;ay, that the will determines them now that they are pa&s;t. Al&s;o all future acts of the will erelong will be pre&s;ent; and when they &s;hall be pre&s;ent, they will not, according to Dr. We&s;t's conce&s;&s;ion, be determin|ed by the will. Therefore he will not &s;ay, that they are determined by the will now, before they come in|to

exi&s;tence. Doubtle&s;s by whatever they are deter|mined, they are determined by it at the very in&s;tant of their coming into exi&s;tence. No cau&s;e produces an effect, at a time before or after the exi&s;tence of that effect: Therefore by this conce&s;&s;ion of Dr. We&s;t it &s;eems he holds, that no volition, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent or future is determined by the will, or by the mind in the exerci&s;e of the will. Yet Dr. We&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly pleads for a &s;elf-determining power: But what good purpo&s;e does this power an&s;wer, &s;ince it determines no act of will? It &s;eems it is a very innocent and harmle&s;s thing, becau&s;e it is very inefficacious and dormant, doing neither good nor hurt.</P>
<P>Dr. Clarke, in papers between Leibnitz and him|&s;elf, p. 73, grants, that
<Q>nothing <HI>is,</HI> without a &s;uffi|cient rea&s;on why it is, rather than not; and why it is <HI>thus,</HI> rather than otherwi&s;e. But</Q>
&s;ays, that
<Q>in things in their own nature indifferent, <HI>mere will,</HI> without any thing external to influence it, is alone that &s;ufficient rea&s;on.</Q>
By <HI>will</HI> the Doctor mu&s;t mean either an <HI>act</HI> of volition, or the <HI>power</HI> of the will. If he mean that the former is the rea&s;on or ground of our acts of the will, he runs into the infi|nite &s;eries. If he mean the latter it is as ab&s;urd as to &s;ay, The ability of Dr. Clarke to write his replies to Leibnitz, was <HI>alone</HI> the &s;ufficient rea&s;on why he wrote them.</P>
<P>Dr. Price in his corre&s;pondence with Dr. Prie&s;tly, p. 136, &s;ays,
<Q>It cannot be ju&s;tly &s;aid, that &s;elf-deter|mination implies an effect without a cau&s;e. Does it follow, that becau&s;e I am my&s;elf the cau&s;e, there is no cau&s;e?</Q>
To this I an&s;wer, that though it does indeed not follow, that becau&s;e I am my&s;elf the cau&s;e of a volition, there is no cau&s;e; as it is tak|en for granted, that there is a cau&s;e, and that I am that cau&s;e; yet from the &s;uppo&s;ition, that volition is not the effect of a cau&s;e extrin&s;ic to the mind in which it takes place, it will follow, that there is no cau&s;e of it; becau&s;e it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, that the mind
<PB N="59" REF="032073_0057_0FF110A754B1A350">
it&s;elf &s;hould be the cau&s;e of it. The impo&s;&s;ibility of this has been already &s;tated in the preceding di&s;cour&s;e, and more largely illu&s;trated by other writers: And if any man will &s;how the po&s;&s;ibility of the mind's cau&s;|ing its own volitions, and will remove the ab&s;urdities attending that &s;uppo&s;ition; <HI>erit mihi Magnus Apollo:</HI> It will then, and not till then, be incumbent on us to &s;peak of &s;elf-determination in a very different &s;train.</P>
<P>In fine; tho&s;e who plead for a &s;elf-determining pow|er, either mean what Dr. We&s;t declares he means, that we our&s;elves de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ine whenever we do deter|mine; which is no par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the &s;ubject of this contro|ver&s;y, is di&s;puted by none and is nothing oppo&s;ite to moral nece&s;&s;ity, extrin&s;ic cau&s;ality of volition, &amp;c. but amounts to this merely, that we are the &s;ubjects of volition: Or they mean, that we are the efficient cau&s;es of our own volitions. But the&s;e men &s;eem never to have reflected &s;o far on the &s;ubject, as to &s;ee, that this idea of &s;elf-determination runs into what has been &s;o often charged upon them, an infinite &s;e|ries of volitions cau&s;ing one another: And therefore when this difficulty is &s;ugge&s;ted to them, they are ei|ther &s;ilenced and have nothing to an&s;wer, or el&s;e an|&s;wer in &s;uch a manner as to &s;how, that by efficiently cau&s;ing our own volitions they mean merely what Dr. We&s;t profe&s;&s;es to mean, that we <HI>will</HI> or are the &s;ub|jects of volition, which no more implies, that we cau&s;e them, than that we cau&s;e all our own perceptions and feelings follows from our being the &s;ubjects of them.</P>
<P>"I take it to be an important truth," &s;ays the Doc|tor, Part II, p. 19,

What a pity, that the Doctor &s;hould under|take the defence of a propo&s;ition, which he is nece&s;&s;i|tated perpetually to beg! Or if he be not nece&s;&s;itat|ed to beg it, what a pity that he &s;hould do it without nece&s;&s;ity! He knows or ought to have known, that this which he here takes for granted, is not conceded; that Pre&s;ident Edwards and all his followers hold, that

the mo&s;t ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity is con&s;i&s;tent with perfect liberty, and that an agent acting under moral nece&s;&s;ity, is &s;o far from a contradiction, that neither God nor creature is or can be any other agent. If Dr. We&s;t &s;hould &s;ay, that a nece&s;&s;ary agent is a con|tradiction according to <HI>his idea</HI> of agent, <HI>i. e.</HI> a &s;elf-determinate agent or one acting by chance: Be it &s;o; he ought to prove, and not a&s;&s;ume, that his idea is po&s;&s;ible and according to truth.</P>
<P>"When a man con&s;iders," (&s;ays Dr. We&s;t, p. 23, Part II,)
<Q>that he is not moved by any extrin&s;ic cau&s;e to do evil, but that his wickedne&s;s has <HI>origin|ated wholly from him&s;elf,</HI> he mu&s;t feel him&s;elf ex|ceedingly vile and unworthy of any divine favour.</Q>
This is talking altogether in the clouds: What does he mean by wickedne&s;s originated from a man's &s;elf? He cannot con&s;i&s;tently mean, that
<Q>&s;elf acts on &s;elf and produces wickedne&s;s; for this he rejects as ab&s;urd.</Q>
If he mean, that a man is him&s;elf the &s;ub|ject of wickedne&s;s, wicked volitions or actions; this is granted; but it is not at all oppo&s;ed to his being moved by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e to that wickedne&s;s, any more than a man's being the &s;ubject of pain is incon|&s;i&s;tent with the pain's being effected by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e.

That men have an exi&s;tence and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s di&s;tinct from Deity, is granted; but that it thence follows, that they have a &s;elf-determining power, if by that be meant any thing di&s;tinct from a faculty of will influenced by extrin&s;ic motives and cau&s;es is not granted, and ought not to have been taken for granted, nor a&s;&s;erted without proof.

brutes have a &s;elf-determining power; which is not generally allowed by the advocates for that power. For brutes have both an exi&s;tence and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s di&s;tinct from the Deity.</P>
<P><Q>He that cannot govern his own mind; but is con&s;tantly determined by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, is cer|tainly the &s;ubject of mere chance and accident; ibid, p. 28.</Q>

<P><Q>Our doctrine of &s;elf-determination implying, that when the mind acts, it always has an object in view, and that there is always a rea&s;on for acting, is as fully con&s;i&s;tent with our being the &s;ubjects of com|mands and promi&s;es, prohibitions and threatenings, and e&s;tabli&s;hes as &s;ure a connection between means and ends, as he [Pre&s;ident Edwards] can &s;uppo&s;e to ari&s;e from the doctrine of Nece&s;&s;ity.</Q>
Ibid, p. 29. Yet the Doctor's doctrine is,
<Q>that men are not always governed by the &s;tronge&s;t motive, and that there is no &s;ure connection between motives and ac|tion.</Q>
Ibid, p. 6. Now the Doctor is &s;peaking of the means and ends of moral agents and moral actions; and particularly of commands and promi&s;es, prohibi|tions and threatenings, con&s;idered as motives and means of action. And does that doctrine which teaches that there is no &s;ure connection between the &s;tronge&s;t motive, or even any motives, whether &s;trong|er or weaker, and action, e&s;tabli&s;h as &s;ure a connec|tion between &s;uch means and their ends, which are moral actions, as that doctrine which teaches, that there is a &s;ure and infallible connection between &s;uch means and their ends? Is it not &s;urpri&s;ing, that the Doctor &s;hould a&s;&s;ert &s;uch a thing?</P>
<P>He tells us, ibid, p. 29,
<Q>That he holds no &s;uch kind of &s;elf-determination, as a power to act without

and again&s;t every kind of rea&s;on or argument.</Q>
But he does hold a power to act without and again&s;t the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t</HI> rea&s;ons and arguments: Therefore he ought much more to hold a power to act without and again&s;t the weaker; and con&s;equently a power to act without and again&s;t every kind of rea&s;on and argument. Nay, the Doctor does expre&s;sly hold a power to <HI>re&s;i&s;t</HI> all motives, rea&s;ons and arguments, and a power to remain <HI>inactive</HI> notwith&s;tanding the &s;olicitations of them all. And is it not &s;trange, that he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a power to re&s;i&s;t and remain inactive, without and again&s;t every kind of rea&s;on and argument; has not al&s;o a power to re&s;i&s;t them in acting again&s;t them?</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. Of Motives and their Influence.</HEAD>
<P>DR. We&s;t has given his definition of a motive, p. 17;
<Q>It is the occa&s;ion, rea&s;on, end or de&s;ign, which an agent has in view, when he acts.</Q>
And he grants, ibid,
<Q>that the mind acts upon motives; <HI>i. e.</HI> when the mind acts or choo&s;es, it always has &s;ome end, de&s;ign or rea&s;on, which is the occa&s;ion of its acting or choo&s;ing. Therefore motives, in our &s;en&s;e of the term, are the previous circum&s;tances, which are nece&s;&s;ary for action.</Q>
And, Part II, p. 93;
<Q>Action <HI>cannot</HI> take place without &s;ome object, rea|&s;on or motive; and the motive or rea&s;on for acting <HI>mu&s;t be prior</HI> to the action of the mind, and be <HI>perceived</HI> by it, before it <HI>can act.</HI></Q>
<Q>Nothing <HI>can</HI> become an object of choice, except it appears to be eligible; p. 95, Part II.</Q>
Yet he maintains,
<Q>that there is no infallible connec|tion between motive and action;</Q>
and that
<Q>when mo|tives have done all that they can do, the mind may act or not act.</Q>
The rea&s;on which he a&s;&s;igns for this, is,
<Q>that though the mind never acts without &s;ome rea&s;on or de&s;ign in acting; yet there is no need of a&s;&s;igning a rea&s;on for <HI>not acting.</HI></Q>
P. 17, 18.&mdash;If by <HI>acting or not acting</HI> he mean a volunta|ry acting or not acting, or a choo&s;ing or refu&s;ing of the motives pre&s;ented; it is to be ob&s;erved, as I have already ob&s;erved, that refu&s;ing is as real an action as choo&s;ing; and a voluntary not acting is a <HI>voluntary</HI> refu&s;al to act and to comply with the motives propo&s;|ed, and is as real a volition as any other; and there|fore by his own conce&s;&s;ion,
<Q>motive is nece&s;&s;ary to it,</Q>
equally nece&s;&s;ary as for any other volition or action.&mdash;Or if by <HI>not acting</HI> Dr. We&s;t mean no act of either choo&s;ing or refu&s;ing, but a perfect inaction; then what he &s;ays, will come to this&punc; That when mo|tives
<PB N="64" REF="032073_0062_0FF1104819344158">
are propo&s;ed, the mind may choo&s;e to comply with them, or it may refu&s;e to comply with them, or it may do neither. But the impo&s;&s;ibility of this I en|deavoured to illu&s;trate in the &s;econd chapter, and &s;hall &s;ay no more on it at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But if it were po&s;&s;ible, that on the propo&s;al of mo|tives, the mind &s;hould <HI>not act at all</HI>; how would it follow, as Dr. We&s;t &s;ays, that there is no infallible connection between motive and <HI>action?</HI> It is granted by Dr. We&s;t that motive is nece&s;&s;ary to every action, whether of choice or refu&s;al; and to &s;ay as the Doctor does, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>not acting,</HI> amounts to this merely, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary for involuntary, block|i&s;h inaction or torpitude.&mdash;By infallible connection we mean no more than con&s;tant invariable connection, &s;o that whenever the mind acts, whether in choice or refu&s;al, it is under the per&s;ua&s;ive influence of &s;ome motive, which, as Dr. We&s;t grants,
<Q>is the rea&s;on and occa&s;ion of its acting</Q>
and
<Q>a circum&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary for action.</Q>
We pretend not but that the man, when motives are pre&s;ented, may po&s;&s;ibly fall into a &s;woon or other &s;tate of involuntary &s;tupidi|ty. If this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, it would be nothing to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. For the que&s;tion before us is, whether volition be or be not in all ca&s;es accord|ing to motive in the large &s;en&s;e of Pre&s;ident Edwards, including rea&s;ons, and external objects, with the ta&s;te and bias of the mind. This is what is meant by a determination by motive. Let what will be the cau&s;e of involuntary and torpid inaction; &s;o long as it is granted, as Dr. We&s;t does grant, that motive is nec|e&s;&s;ary to volition, and that every volition, whether choice or refu&s;al, is occa&s;ioned by motive, and never exi&s;ts without it, every thing is granted on this head, for which we contend.</P>

<Q>I &s;ometimes u&s;e the word cau&s;e in this <HI>In|quiry,</HI> to &s;ignify <HI>any antecedent</HI> either natural or mor|al, po&s;itive or negative, on which an event, either a thing or the manner and circum&s;tance of a thing, &s;o depends, that it is the ground and rea&s;on, either in whole or in part, why it is rather than not; or why it is rather than otherwi&s;e. Or in other words, any antecedent with which a con&s;equent event is &s;o connected, that it truly belongs to the rea&s;on why the propo&s;ition, which affirms that event, is true; whether it has any po&s;itive influence or not.</Q>
Now, does Dr. We&s;t deny, that motive is an antece|dent, on which volition either in whole or part de|pends? Or that it is a ground or rea&s;on, either in whole or part, either by po&s;itive influence or not, why it is rather than not? Surely he cannot with con&s;i&s;tence deny this, &s;ince he does &s;ay, "By mo|tive we
<Q>under&s;tand the <HI>occa&s;ion, rea&s;on,</HI> end or de|&s;ign, which an agent has in view, when he acts;</Q>
and that motives are the <HI>previous</HI>
<Q>circum&s;tances, which are <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for action?</Q>
Surely a previous circum&s;tance, which is nece&s;&s;ary for action or voli|tion, is an "antecedent on which volition depends;" and
<Q>a rea&s;on which an agent has in view, when he acts,</Q>
and
<Q>a rea&s;on which is the occa&s;ion of his acting,</Q>
<Q>is a rea&s;on either in whole or part, why the action is.</Q>
So that however de&s;irous Dr. We&s;t may be, to be thought to differ, in this point, from Pre&s;ident Edwards, it appears, that he mo&s;t exactly agrees with him. Yet he &s;ays, p. 11,
<Q>Mr. Edwards, by making motives the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of acts of the will, and by declaring, that the exi&s;tence of the acts of the will is the effect of their motives, appears full as un|intelligible <HI>to me,</HI> as Chubb could po&s;&s;ibly appear to him.</Q>
But as it appears, that Pre&s;ident Edwards has explained him&s;elf to mean by <HI>cau&s;e</HI> no other than <HI>occa&s;ion, rea&s;on</HI> or <HI>previous circum&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary for volition;</HI> and that in this Dr. We&s;t entirely agrees with him; if Pre&s;ident Edwards appear ab&s;urd to
<PB N="66" REF="032073_0064_0FF1108456A5F170">
Dr. We&s;t, Dr. We&s;t mu&s;t appear ab&s;urd to him&s;elf, even as ab&s;urd as Chubb could po&s;&s;ibly appear to Pre&s;ident Edwards.</P>
<P>I do not pretend, that motives are the <HI>efficient</HI> cau&s;es of volition. If any expre&s;&s;ion importing this, have dropped from any defender of the connection between motive and volition; either it mu&s;t have happened through inadvertence, or he mu&s;t have meant, that motive is an <HI>efficient cau&s;e</HI> in no other &s;en&s;e than rain and the rays of the &s;un are the efficient cau&s;e of the growth of vegetables, or than medicine is the efficient cau&s;e of health.</P>
<P>When we a&s;&s;ert, that volition is determined by mo|tive, we mean not that motive is the efficient cau&s;e of it; but we mean, that there is a &s;tated connection between volition and motive, &s;o that as Dr. We&s;t &s;ays,
<Q>Whenever the mind acts or choo&s;es, it ALWAYS has &s;ome rea&s;on</Q>
or motive,
<Q>which is the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of its acting or choo&s;ing,</Q>
and
<Q>is a previous circum|&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary for action or volition.</Q>
This a|mounts to all we mean by an infallible connection be|tween motive and volition; and therefore though Dr. We&s;t denies &s;uch a connection, he in fact holds it, as much as we do. By infallible connection be|tween motive and volition, we mean, that volition never takes place without &s;ome motive, rea&s;on or cau&s;e of its exi&s;tence, either in the views of the mind of him, who is the &s;ubject of the volition, in the di&s;|po&s;ition, bias or appetite of his mind or body, or from the influence of &s;ome extrin&s;ic agent. In a &s;en&s;e large enough to comprehend all the&s;e Pre&s;ident Edwards explains him&s;elf to u&s;e the word <HI>motive.</HI> His words are,
<Q>By motive I mean the whole of that which moves, excites or invites the mind to volition, whether that be one thing &s;ingly, or many things con|junctly; p. 5.</Q>
He then proceeds to enumerate &s;ev|eral things which operate as motives, viz. the <HI>views</HI> of the mind, the <HI>&s;tate, frame</HI> and <HI>temper,</HI> &amp;c. which the mind may have by nature, or which may have been
<PB N="67" REF="032073_0065_0FF11049A8DDAF68">
introduced by education, example, cu&s;tom or <HI>other means.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t grants an infallible connection between motive and volition;&mdash;1. In that he grants, that motive is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to volition;&mdash;2. In that he grants, that "there is <HI>always</HI> a <HI>rea&s;on</HI> for the mind's acting or choo&s;ing, and that
<Q>when the mind acts, it always has &s;ome end, de&s;ign or <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> which is the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of its acting; and in that he defines <HI>motive</HI> to be the <HI>occa&s;ion, rea&s;on,</HI> end or de&s;ign, which an agent has in view, when he acts.</Q>
In the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions not only does he expre&s;sly grant, that whenever there is a volition there is a motive; but he implicitly grants al&s;o, that whenever there is a motive there is a volition. He expre&s;sly grants, that motive is the rea|&s;on of the mind's acting. But the rea&s;on of the mind's acting is infallibly connected with its acting: Other|wi&s;e it is not the rea&s;on of its acting. If either the mind &s;hould act without the &s;uppo&s;ed rea&s;on; or if when the &s;uppo&s;ed rea&s;on exi&s;ts, the action does not follow; this fact in either ca&s;e &s;hows plainly, that the &s;uppo&s;ed rea&s;on is not the real rea&s;on of the action.&mdash;Again, motive is conceded to be the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of the mind's acting. But if the motive exi&s;t and the action do not follow; it is plain, that the motive is not the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of the action.&mdash;As motive is allowed to be the <HI>rea|&s;on</HI> of the action of the mind, it is as ab&s;urd, that the motive &s;hould exi&s;t without the action, as that the rea&s;on of an action &s;hould exi&s;t without the action; indeed it is the &s;ame thing. Let what will be &s;uppo&s;|ed to be the rea&s;on of an action, if that &s;uppo&s;ed rea|&s;on exi&s;t, and the action do not follow, this proves, the &s;uppo&s;ed rea&s;on is fal&s;ely &s;uppo&s;ed to be the rea|&s;on; and that either &s;omething el&s;e is the true rea&s;on, or that the action came into exi&s;tence without rea|&s;on.&mdash;If then motive be, as Dr. We&s;t grants, the occa&s;ion and rea&s;on of action, it is as ab&s;urd and con|tradictory to &s;ay, that there is not an infallible con|nection between action and motive, as that there
<PB N="68" REF="032073_0066_0FF1104B907EAFD0">
is not &s;uch a connection between a thing and its cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t argues, that motives cannot be univer|&s;ally the cau&s;es of volition, as this would imply, that they are the cau&s;e of the divine volitions: But that
<Q>motives cannot be the cau&s;e of the divine volitions; for this would be to a&s;&s;ert, that motives were the cau&s;e of the fir&s;t cau&s;e.</Q>
Now the &s;ame rea&s;oning will equally confute Dr. We&s;t's &s;cheme of motives; thus, Motives cannot be nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions of voli|tions, as this would imply, that they are the nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions of the divine volitions. But to a&s;&s;ert this, would be to a&s;&s;ert, that motives are the nece&s;&s;ary oc|ca&s;ions of the fir&s;t cau&s;e.</P>
<P>As volition always implies and &s;uppo&s;es a motive; &s;o does a motive as evidently imply and infer a voli|tion. For by the very terms, that is no motive to a man, which does not per&s;uade, move or excite him to volition. This is the &s;en&s;e in which Pre&s;ident Ed|wards u&s;es the word motive. It is not pretended by the mo&s;t zealous advocate for the influence of mo|tives, that the &s;ame objects and rea&s;ons will always alike influence a man, and in like manner <HI>move</HI> or <HI>be motives</HI> to him; unle&s;s it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the &s;tate of the mind and every thing relating to it, be the &s;ame. The mind of man is from various cau&s;es exceedingly changeable, and by no means at all times &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ions from the &s;ame intellectual views and from the &s;ame bia&s;es. The intellectual views may be the &s;ame, and the bia&s;es may be differ|ent; and the bia&s;es may be the &s;ame and the intel|lectual views may be different. It will not be deni|ed, that there is an infallible connection between cau&s;e and effect: Yet this does not imply, that the &s;ame ef|fect always follows from the &s;ame cau&s;e, unle&s;s by the &s;ame cau&s;e be meant, all the &s;ame things and circum|&s;tances, which related to the effect, or may have had influence to produce it. And with the like explana|tion
<PB N="69" REF="032073_0067_0FF1104EC73229C0">
of the word motive, it is true, that the &s;ame mo|tive is always attended with the &s;ame volition.</P>
<P>Since then wherever there is a volition, there is a motive, and wherever there is a motive, or, which is Dr. We&s;t's explanation of motive, wherever there is the rea&s;on and occa&s;ion of volition, there is volition, and al&s;o &s;ince wherever there is the &s;ame motive in the &s;en&s;e ju&s;t now explained, there is the &s;ame voli|tion; what is wanting to &s;upport the propo&s;ition, that there is an infallible connection between motive and volition? A connection ju&s;t as infallible as that between cau&s;e and effect?</P>
<P>Since our volitions are thus entirely limited, bound|ed and determined <HI>according to</HI> motives; wherein con&s;i&s;ts the impropriety of &s;aying, that our volitions are determined <HI>by motives?</HI> We mean no more by the latter expre&s;&s;ion, than we do by the former.</P>
<P>If all our volitions be in this &s;en&s;e determined by motives, in what &s;en&s;e can it be pretended, that they are &s;elf-determined; or that we determine and cau&s;e our own volitions? And what will become of the whole doctrine of &s;elf-determination? It will not be pretended, that we cau&s;e all the objects, with which we are &s;urrounded, and which pre&s;ent them&s;elves to us as objects of choice; nor that we cau&s;e all our nat|ural bia&s;es, ta&s;tes and appetites, which are the &s;ources of &s;o many volitions.&mdash;If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that we determine our own motives, determine which motives we will comply with and which we will reject; &s;till as this very determination is the act of the will, a motive is nece&s;&s;ary to that. Thus we &s;hall go round in a circle; motive, determining, or (in the language of Dr. We&s;t) <HI>being previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to volition, and volition being nece&s;&s;ary to motive.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, that allowing what Dr. We&s;t does allow, no man can hold &s;elf-determination, in any other &s;en&s;e than one of the&s;e two; (1) That we our&s;elves deter|mine, as we our&s;elves think, perceive, hear, ta&s;te, &amp;c. which is no more than we all allow; and to explain
<PB N="70" REF="032073_0068_0FF110862B279F68">
&s;elf-determination thus, is to explain it away and give it up; and, as has been &s;hown, it is thus given up by Dr. We&s;t.&mdash;(2) That we efficiently cau&s;e our own volitions, but invariably according to motives, rea&s;ons or pree&s;tabli&s;hed antecedents. This cannot be con|&s;i&s;tently avowed by Dr. We&s;t, both becau&s;e he main|tains, that volition is no effect and has no cau&s;e, there|fore we cannot be the cau&s;e of it; and becau&s;e to be the efficient cau&s;es of our own volitions implies, that "&s;elf acts on &s;elf and produces volition;" which is ex|pre&s;sly renounced by him.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t, to prove, that there is no infallible con|nection between motive and volition &s;ays, p. 17, 18;
<Q>Though it is true, that the mind never acts without &s;ome rea&s;on or de&s;ign in acting; yet there is no need of a&s;&s;igning a rea&s;on for <HI>not acting.</HI></Q>
By <HI>not acting,</HI> Dr. We&s;t means, as ob&s;erved before, either <HI>re|fu&s;ing</HI> and <HI>voluntary neglect,</HI> or <HI>entire inaction.</HI> If he mean the former, it is a real act of the mind and by his own conce&s;&s;ion therefore is not
<Q>without a rea&s;on and de&s;ign.</Q>
If he mean the latter, his argument is ju&s;t as conclu&s;ive to di&s;prove an infallible connection between motive and volition, as the &s;ame argument is to di&s;prove the connection between cau&s;e and effect&punc; Thus though it be true, that an effect never comes to pa&s;s without a cau&s;e; yet there is no need of a&s;&s;ign|ing a cau&s;e for <HI>no effect.</HI> It is undoubtedly true, that perfect nihility requires no cau&s;e: But no man in his &s;en&s;es would hence infer, that an effect requires no cau&s;e, or that there is not an infallible connection be|tween cau&s;e and effect. In like manner
<Q>there is no need of a&s;&s;igning a rea&s;on or motive for perfect in|action, which is pure nihility.</Q>
But it cannot be hence inferred, that there is no need of a motive for action, or that there is not an infallible connection between motive and action. Dr. We&s;t denies an infallible connection between motive and action, and he en|deavours to prove it by making it out that there is no connection between motive and <HI>inaction:</HI> And what
<PB N="71" REF="032073_0069_0FF110516C49BCF0">
is this to the purpo&s;e? How does it hence follow, that there is not an infallible connection between motive and <HI>action?</HI></P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t puts the &s;uppo&s;ition, that at a gentleman's table he has the offer of tea, coffee or chocolate; that they can all be had with equal ea&s;e, and all appear equally eligible to his mind, and that he determines to take coffee. He then adds, p. 18,
<Q>I believe, that it is impo&s;&s;ible in this and a multitude of &s;imilar in&s;tances to a&s;&s;ign any accident or circum&s;tance, which deter|mines the mind to its choice among things, which ap|pear equally fit and eligible. Con&s;equently here is an undeniable proof of the liberty for which we contend. And this in&s;tance will explain my idea, that there is always a rea&s;on for acting or choo&s;ing: But that there is not always a rea&s;on for not acting; and that things may appear eligible to us, and yet not be cho&s;en; <HI>e. g.</HI> I accepted the coffee, becau&s;e I wanted &s;ome refre&s;hment. Coffee appeared to me properly &s;uited to an&s;wer my de&s;ire. This was a &s;uffi|cient rea&s;on for my receiving coffee. The other two appeared equally eligible. About them I exerted no acts: But this being a <HI>mere negation,</HI> could require no po&s;itive rea&s;on.</Q>
&mdash;On this I remark,</P>
<P N="1">1. If it were ever &s;o true, that in choo&s;ing between things perfectly indifferent, (if any &s;uch there be) the mind acts without motive, how would this prove, that it acts without motive in any other ca&s;e? And the in&s;tances of its choo&s;ing things perfectly indifferent are &s;o rare, that with re&s;pect to the main object of this di&s;pute, they &s;eem hardly worth mentioning. The great object of this di&s;pute is, to inve&s;tigate that liber|ty which is nece&s;&s;ary to virtue and vice, prai&s;e and blame. Dr. We&s;t, if I under&s;tand him, contends, that an exemption from an infallible connection between motive and volition is e&s;&s;ential to that liberty. Or if I do not under&s;tand him aright in this in&s;tance, he is at liberty to make his choice, whether or not to main|tain, that an exemption from &s;uch connection be e&s;|&s;ential
<PB N="72" REF="032073_0070_0FF10FE88AEA76D0">
to that liberty, without which we cannot prac|ti&s;e virtue or vice. If he maintain, that this exemp|tion is e&s;&s;ential to that liberty, I a&s;k, Do we exerci&s;e virtue or vice in tho&s;e in&s;tances only, in which we choo&s;e one of things perfectly indifferent; or does it follow from the &s;uppo&s;ition, that we act without mo|tive in tho&s;e in&s;tances, in which we do choo&s;e one of things perfectly indifferent, that we al&s;o act without motive in other in&s;tances; viz. in choo&s;ing one of things perfectly different, as virtue and vice, wi&s;dom and folly, out eternal happine&s;s and eternal mi&s;ery? If it be not true, that we exerci&s;e virtue or vice in tho&s;e in&s;tances only in which we choo&s;e one of things perfectly indifferent; nor that from the &s;uppo&s;ition, that there are things perfectly indifferent, and that we act without motive when we choo&s;e one of &s;uch things, it follows that we act without motive in other ca&s;es too; what is the great advantage of a power of choo&s;|ing without motive in &s;uch a rare ca&s;e? And is it worth while to di&s;pute about it? If we exerci&s;e moral agency in tho&s;e in&s;tances only, in which we choo&s;e one of things perfectly indifferent; our moral agency is confined to very narrow limits indeed, not extend|ing to one of ten thou&s;and of our rational voluntary actions, as, I pre&s;ume, our opponents them&s;elves will grant. If we exerci&s;e moral agency in tho&s;e in&s;tances, in which we choo&s;e one of things entirely different, either we are per&s;uaded and influenced by the differ|ence and &s;o are governed by motive, and then the in|fluence of motives is not incon&s;i&s;tent with moral agen|cy or with liberty; or we choo&s;e and act without any regard to the difference of the propo&s;ed objects: But this mu&s;t be proved, to obtain credit. If our oppo|nents &s;uppo&s;e that it follow from our acting without motive, when (as they &s;ay) we choo&s;e one of things indifferent, that al&s;o we act without motive, when we choo&s;e one of things not indifferent; let them &s;how that it does follow. They have not as yet done it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="73" REF="032073_0071_0FF110064ED7D5D0">2. In the pa&s;&s;age quoted above, Dr. We&s;t con&s;id|ers his choice of coffee, as a real act of his mind a|ri&s;ing from a rea&s;on or motive; but his neglect or re|fu&s;al of tea and chocolate as a mere <HI>negation,</HI> which requires no rea&s;on or motive. But I appeal to every candid reader, whether a voluntary refu&s;al of any ob|ject, be not as real an act of the mind, as a choice. If &s;o, in truth and according to Dr. We&s;t's conce&s;&s;ion, it requires a rea&s;on and motive, as much as any other act. I do not mean, that his refu&s;al of tea and cho|colate in the ca&s;e put, is nece&s;&s;arily a di&s;tinct act from his choice of coffee: It may be no more a dictinct act, than &s;uppo&s;ing coffee alone had been offered him, and he had accepted it rather than nothing, his ac|ceptance of it and his refu&s;al of nothing had been two entirely di&s;tinct acts. The truth is, that his choice of coffee is one complex comparative act, implying a <HI>preference</HI> of coffee to tea and chocolate. I am &s;en|&s;ible, that Dr. We&s;t holds,
<Q>that choice, when u&s;ed about the determination of the mind re&s;pecting the things that appear to us equally eligible, does not include in it the idea of <HI>preference;</HI> p. 16.</Q>
But what el&s;e is meant by <HI>preference,</HI> than the choo&s;ing of one thing rather than another or in the neglect of that other, when both are offered? If Dr. We&s;t mean by <HI>preference</HI> any thing different from this, he ought in all rea&s;on to inform us what it is. The rea&s;on which the Doctor gives, to &s;how that a choice of one of two equally eligible things, is not a preference is, that "they are both con&s;idered as equally eligible:" P. 16: <HI>i. e.</HI> they are, (if I may &s;o &s;ay) equally <HI>choo&s;able</HI> or equally worthy of choice. And if one cannot be <HI>preferred,</HI> becau&s;e they are equally worthy of choice; let it be &s;hown, that it is not equally impo&s;&s;ible that one of them &s;hould be <HI>cho&s;en</HI> when they are equally worthy of choice. If the con&s;ideration that they are equally worthy of choice, preclude the po&s;&s;ibility of <HI>preference,</HI> why does it no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> equally preclude the po&s;|bility of <HI>election</HI> or <HI>choice?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="032073_0072_0FF11008908ECCD0">Dr. We&s;t &s;ays, that his acceptance of coffee, as it was an act, required a rea&s;on; but about tea and chocolate he exerted no act; and this being a mere negation, could require no po&s;itive rea&s;on. Now if coffee or nothing had been offered him, and he had accepted the coffee, he might as well have &s;aid, that his acceptance of coffee, as it was an act, required a rea&s;on; but about nothing he exerted no act; and this being a mere negation, could require no po&s;itive rea&s;on. The truth is, every act of choice is a com|parative act, whether one or more things be offered to our choice. When only one thing is offered, the com|pari&s;on is between that and nothing. When one of &s;everal things is offered, the compari&s;on is between tho&s;e &s;everal things. And if we accept the one thing, which alone is offered, we no more refu&s;e or decline the alternative <HI>nothing</HI> or the ab&s;ence of that one thing, than when we accept one of &s;everal things we refu&s;e the re&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. If when &s;everal things, which Dr. We&s;t calls equally eligible, are offered, and a man choo&s;e one of them, it be true, that he exerts no act about the re&s;t; the &s;ame would hold, though the things were not equally eligible and the things refu&s;ed were manife&s;t|ly mo&s;t eligible: And thus it would be mo&s;t ea&s;y to account for an act of preference of a mo&s;t inferiour object, to a mo&s;t &s;uperiour one. It is but &s;aying, that about the la&s;t
<Q>I exerted no act: And this be|ing a mere negation would require no po&s;itive rea&s;on.</Q>
Thus &s;uppo&s;e a guinea and a &s;hilling be offered to a beggar: He takes the &s;hilling, but leaves the guinea. May not the beggar account for his conduct in the &s;ame way that Dr. We&s;t accounts for his, in taking the coffee in the neglect of the tea and the chocolate? He might &s;ay,
<Q>I accepted the &s;hilling, becau&s;e I wanted a little money: The &s;hilling appeared prop|erly &s;uited to an&s;wer my de&s;ire. The guinea ap|peared equally</Q>
and much more
<Q>eligible: About that I exerted no act. But this being a mere ne|gation,
<PB N="75" REF="032073_0073_0FF110892DFE1FC8">
could require no po&s;itive rea&s;on.</Q>
But the que&s;tion would &s;till remain unan&s;wered, Why did not the beggar exert an act about the guinea, as well as about the &s;hilling, or even in preference to it? Or, which comes to the &s;ame, why did he exert an act about the &s;hilling in the neglect of the guinea? Ju&s;t &s;o, why did Dr. We&s;t exert an act about coffee, in the neglect of tea and chocolate? Whatever be the proper an&s;wer to the la&s;t que&s;tion, will doubtle&s;s as properly an&s;wer the former. Nor need Dr. We&s;t puzzle him&s;elf and his readers about things <HI>equally eligi|ble.</HI> His principles are ju&s;t as applicable to any oth|er things, and equally prove that there is no connec|tion at all between motive and volition, as that there is not an infallible and univer&s;al connection.</P>
<P N="4">4. Dr. We&s;t grants, that
<Q>when the mind choo&s;es, it always has &s;ome <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> which is the occa&s;ion of its choo&s;ing.</Q>
Therefore when he cho&s;e coffee in the neglect of tea or chocolate, there was &s;ome rea&s;on for it. But I appeal to the reader, whether accord|ing to the Doctor's own &s;tatement of the ca&s;e, there was any rea&s;on why he &s;hould choo&s;e coffee in the neglect of tea and chocolate, and whether there was not the very &s;ame rea&s;on why he &s;hould have cho&s;en tea or chocolate in the neglect of coffee. He &s;ays, they all appeared equally eligible to him. Therefore there was no rea&s;on, according to him, why he &s;hould choo&s;e one, to the neglect of the others.</P>
<P>In his &s;econd part as well as in his fir&s;t the Doctor grants, that
<Q>the mind never acts without &s;ome rea|&s;on for acting.</Q>
P. 14, and 29. Yet he holds, that of things equally agreeable, it &s;ometimes choo&s;es one and leaves the re&s;t. Now what is the rea&s;on of its acting in this ca&s;e? It is not enough to a&s;&s;ign a rea|&s;on why the mind &s;hould take <HI>&s;ome one</HI> of &s;ever|al things propo&s;ed. As all tho&s;e things are &s;uppo&s;|ed to be equally eligible, a rea&s;on ought to be given why it finally takes one particular one in the neglect of the re&s;t. Unle&s;s this be done, no rea&s;on is given
<PB N="76" REF="032073_0074_0FF10FDA915DADC0">
why it acts in this manner, in this ca&s;e; and therefore for ought that appears, it acts without rea&s;on, which is contrary to the Doctor's conce&s;&s;ion. Therefore let the Doctor either retract his conce&s;&s;ion, and hold that the mind &s;ometimes acts without any rea&s;on; or re|nounce the idea, that it &s;ometimes choo&s;es one of &s;ev|eral things equally eligible, in the neglect of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Doctor &s;ays, p. 28, Part II,
<Q>When two ob|jects are equally fit, if one is taken and the other left; the mind had a purpo&s;e to an&s;wer.</Q>
We &s;hould have been greatly gratified, if the Doctor had pointed out, what purpo&s;e the mind had to an&s;wer in taking that one which it did take, and in leaving the re&s;t by &s;uppo&s;ition equally fit to an&s;wer the &s;ame pur|po&s;e, for which the one is taken. Until he does point out the purpo&s;e, he mu&s;t excu&s;e us in withholding our a&s;&s;ent and denying his propo&s;ition.&mdash;The Doctor in this repeats what he had &s;aid in his fir&s;t part, that "about that which is not taken the mind exerci&s;es no act at all" To this I have already an&s;wered, that the mind does exerci&s;e an act about it; that the act of the mind is complex and comparative, having a re&s;pect to more objects than one, becau&s;e more are &s;uppo&s;ed to be offered and brought into the view of the mind; that the mind does as really exerci&s;e an act about the object left, as if it were ever &s;o inferiour or &s;uperiour to the one taken; and that the Doctor's rea&s;oning, if it prove any thing, proves too much, viz. that if things ever &s;o unequal be offered and the mind choo&s;e the ba&s;e&s;t and that which is in the lowe&s;t degree &s;uited to an&s;wer its purpo&s;e, it may be &s;till &s;aid to have a rea|&s;on for the action.
<Q>But about the other, which is not taken, the mind exerci&s;es no act at all &mdash; no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for the nonexi&s;tence of that which is not.</Q></P>
<P>However, perhaps the Doctor will avow this la&s;t ob&s;ervation, though he has not expre&s;sly done it as yet: For he
<Q>denies, that men are always governed by the &s;tronge&s;t motive.</Q>

avoid all di&s;pute about words, let it be remembered, that by being <HI>governed</HI> by the &s;tronge&s;t motive, is meant no more than that the mind always <HI>follows,</HI> or <HI>coincides with</HI> the &s;tronge&s;t motive: And by <HI>&s;tronge&s;t</HI> motive Pre&s;ident Edwards has explained him&s;elf to mean,
<Q>that which has the greate&s;t degree of previous tendency to excite choice; p. 6.</Q>
Or it is the mo&s;t <HI>per&s;ua&s;ive</HI> motive. Now will Dr. We&s;t &s;ay, that when &s;everal motives are propo&s;ed to a man, he &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;es by the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive, and follows the lea&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive? If &s;o, what is the rea&s;on and what is the motive of its action in this ca&s;e? He allows, that there is a rea&s;on and a motive for every action: Let him point out the rea&s;on and the motive in this action.</P>
<P>The Doctor, p. 31, Part II, &s;ays,
<Q>If the mind never acts without &s;ome motive or rea&s;on for acting, then it follows, that the motives or rea&s;ons for a vir|tuous conduct, and the rea&s;ons and arguments again&s;t the practice of iniquity, ought to be &s;et before us in the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t</HI> light, to <HI>enable</HI> us to choo&s;e virtue and to avoid vice.</Q>
&mdash;1. Are we then unable to choo&s;e virtue and to avoid vice, unle&s;s the motives to the former and again&s;t the latter, "be &s;et before us in the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t</HI> light?" It &s;eems then, that unle&s;s tho&s;e mo|tives be <HI>thus</HI> &s;et before us, we are under no obliga|tion to choo&s;e virtue and to avoid vice, becau&s;e we are not <HI>able</HI> to do it: For it is no part of Dr. We&s;t's &s;y&s;tem, that our duty extends beyond our <HI>ability.</HI> He denies the di&s;tinction between natural and moral ne|ce&s;&s;ity and inability, and holds, that where nece&s;&s;ity or inability begins, liberty and moral agency end. Part II, p. 19.&mdash;2. Of what advantage can it be
<Q>to &s;et the motives to virtue and again&s;t vice in the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t</HI> light, if there be no connection between the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t motives,</HI> and volition?</Q>
Surely none at all. It is therefore implied in the pa&s;&s;age ju&s;t quoted, as in many other pa&s;&s;ages in Dr. We&s;t's book, that there is a connection between &s;uch motives and volition, and that &s;uch connection is not incon&s;i&s;tent with liber|ty.
<PB N="78" REF="032073_0076_0FF1108ACEECA9D8">
Yet as the Doctor
<Q>denies, that we are always governed by the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t motives,</HI> he mu&s;t hold, that there is no <HI>&s;ure</HI> connection between the &s;tronge&s;t motive and volition.</Q>
Then the que&s;tion ari&s;es, What degree of connection between the &s;tronge&s;t motive and volition does he grant to exi&s;t and to be con&s;i&s;t|ent with liberty? If the highe&s;t degree of probability, reaching to the &s;tep next to certainty, be allowed in the ca&s;e, what &s;hould render the only remaining &s;tep &s;o baleful to liberty, as to be incon&s;i&s;tent with it? Or if it be allowed, that the probability, according to the degree of it, does indeed dimini&s;h liberty; then it dimini&s;hes moral agency too; and therefore &s;uch a repre&s;entation of the motives to virtue, as
<Q>&s;ets them in the &s;tronge&s;t light, and makes it more or le&s;s probable, that they will influence to a certain conduct, has in reality no tendency to per&s;uade to a <HI>virtuous</HI> conduct; becau&s;e ju&s;t &s;o far as it has a tendency to lead to any particular conduct, it de&s;troys moral agency and precludes the po&s;&s;ibility of <HI>virtue.</HI></Q>
And &s;uch a repre|&s;entation is &s;o far from
<Q>enabling us to choo&s;e vir|tue, that &s;o far as it has any effect on us, it ren|ders it impo&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould choo&s;e it <HI>morally;</HI> and any other than a <HI>moral</HI> choice of virtue, if other there be, is no &s;ubject of exhortation.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctor a&s;&s;erts,
<Q>that there is not an infallible connection between motives and volition; p. 80, Part II.</Q>
And in the &s;ame page,
<Q>That the infalli|ble connection between motives and volition can|not take place, till the mind has determined to ex|amine the &s;everal motives or rea&s;ons for acting in any particular manner, in order that it may adopt the be&s;t. In that ca&s;e the mind will <HI>certainly</HI> choo&s;e <HI>that which appears the be&s;t.</HI></Q>
Indeed! This is com|ing down wonderfully: This is acknowledging an in|fallible connection between motive and volition in all ca&s;es, in which the mind <HI>examines the &s;everal motives or rea&s;ons for acting:</HI> It is al&s;o acknowledging, that in every &s;uch ca&s;e the mind is governed by the <HI>&s;trong|e&s;t</HI>
<PB N="79" REF="032073_0077_0FF1108E434D7580">
motive, as
<Q>it will certainly <HI>choo&s;e that which</HI> ap|pears to be the be&s;t.</Q>
Of cour&s;e there is an infalli|ble connection between motives and volition in all ca&s;es, except tho&s;e in which the mind acts abruptly and without due con&s;ideration. And is it indeed true, that when the mind acts abruptly, it does not choo&s;e that which <HI>appears</HI> to be be&s;t, but that which at the time appears to be wor&s;t, or at lea&s;t le&s;s good and eligible, than &s;omething el&s;e, at the &s;ame time in view of the mind? When men act abruptly and with|out due con&s;ideration, no wonder if they be mi&s;led by mere appearance, which is not always well found|ed. But do they in &s;uch a ca&s;e, act without regard to any appearance well or ill founded, and even con|trary to the greate&s;t appearance of good? That this is generally fact, needs to be confirmed by &s;omething &s;tronger, than mere a&s;&s;ertion or implication.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t, throughout his books in general oppo&s;es the infallible connection between motive and volition, as incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty and moral agency: But in the pa&s;&s;age on which I am now remarking, grants &s;uch a connection whenever "the mind" acts with proper deliberation, and
<Q>examines the &s;everal mo|tives and rea&s;ons for acting in a particular manner.</Q>
It &s;eems then, that on Dr. We&s;t's plan, whenever the mind acts with proper deliberation, it is under &s;uch an infallible nece&s;&s;ity of &s;o acting, as is incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty and moral agency, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be de&s;titute of liberty and moral agency; and that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es liberty and moral agency then only, when it acts abruptly and without proper deliberation. Will the Doctor avow this con&s;equence? Or if he &s;hould &s;ay, that althou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h when

If it do not
<PB N="80" REF="032073_0078_0FF1106CF572E068">
infringe liberty and moral agency, why is it &s;o vio|lently oppo&s;ed?</P>
<P>The Doctor, in p. 85, Part II, quotes the&s;e lines from Pre&s;ident Edwards;
<Q>I &s;uppo&s;e none will de|ny, that it is po&s;&s;ible for motives to be &s;et before the mind &s;o powerful &mdash; as to be invincible;</Q>
and then he remarks on them,
<Q>If he means, that <HI>argu|ments</HI> may be placed before the under&s;tanding in &s;o &s;trong a light, as to become invincible, and &s;uch as the mind cannot but yield to, it is readily granted, and is nothing to the purpo&s;e: For the under&s;tand|ing is not the active, but the perceptive faculty of the mind; and liberty is placed in the will, which is the only active faculty of the mind. But if the meaning is, that motives may be &s;o &s;trong, as <HI>nece&s;|&s;arily to determine the will,</HI> this is denied to be po&s;|&s;ible, while the mind has the free exerci&s;e of <HI>rea&s;on.</HI> But when the mind is &s;o violently agitated, as to lo&s;e the free exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, as in the ca&s;e of running in a fright &mdash; liberty is de&s;troyed.&mdash; Things that are not eligible in them&s;elves nor in their con&s;equences, cannot become objects of choice; which is to &s;ay, there can be no motive to choo&s;e them, though we may find it difficult, and in &s;ome ca&s;es impracticable to bring our propen&s;ities to &s;ub|mit to our choice. When one is convinced, that he has contracted a wrong habit, he finds no diffi|culty in <HI>choo&s;ing</HI> to overcome that habit; but he will have a va&s;t deal of difficulty in his en|deavours to overcome it, becau&s;e in every unguard|ed hour, he will be liable to be led a&s;tray by his evil habit. And therefore &s;uch a per&s;on may &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, <HI>To will is pre&s;ent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not; for the good that I would, I do not; but the evil that I would not, that I do.</HI> Here we &s;ee, that we may have a power to choo&s;e, when we find it extremely difficult and in &s;ome ca&s;es impo&s;&s;ible to do the things which we
<PB N="81" REF="032073_0079_0FF1100A8EA0B488">
have cho&s;en. This &s;hows the <HI>ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of divine grace to <HI>&s;trengthen</HI> us to do our duty.</Q></P>
<P>On this remarkable pa&s;&s;age, I beg leave to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. That Dr. We&s;t, according to his own principles, cannot con&s;i&s;tently maintain, that
<Q>when the mind lo&s;es the free exerci&s;e of <HI>rea&s;on</HI> its <HI>liberty</HI> is de&s;troy|ed.</Q>
For <HI>rea&s;on</HI> belongs to
<Q>the under&s;tanding, the perceptive faculty,</Q>
and not
<Q>to the will, the only active faculty;</Q>
but
<Q>liberty is placed in the will.</Q>
Therefore according to him liberty is not affected by what takes place in the under&s;tanding, as the free exerci&s;e of <HI>rea&s;on</HI> does. On this ground it is, that he pleads, that tho&s;e arguments which are invin|cible to the under&s;tanding, are nothing to the purpo&s;e as to the que&s;tion concerning liberty, which is placed in the will. The ground of the argument manife&s;tly is, that there is no certain connection between the un|der&s;tanding and the will; and therefore that which overbears the under&s;tanding, does not at all, on that account, affect the will. Therefore that fear, which overbears rea&s;on, does not on that account affect the will or liberty. Otherwi&s;e if that fear which overbears rea&s;on and the right exerci&s;e of the under&s;tanding, do on that account affect and de&s;troy liberty; why do not tho&s;e arguments, which are invincible to the un|der&s;tanding and overbear it, al&s;o affect and de&s;troy liberty; which is denied by Dr. We&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. In this pa&s;&s;age, Dr. We&s;t, however incon&s;i&s;tently with him&s;elf, holds, that motives nece&s;&s;arily determine the will. In the fir&s;t place he declares, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible, that motives &s;hould be &s;o &s;trong as nece&s;&s;a|rily to determine the will, while rea&s;on remains. Yet in the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age he a&s;&s;erts, that
<Q>when once we are convinced, that things are for our greate&s;t good, we can ea&s;ily choo&s;e them,</Q>
and
<Q>things that are not eligible in them&s;elves nor in their con&s;equences,</Q>
and of cour&s;e things that we do not "<HI>perceive</HI>" to be in either of the&s;e re&s;pects eligible,
<Q>cannot become objects of choice.</Q>
In p. 93, Part II, the Doctor
<PB N="82" REF="032073_0080_0FF10FEA64F0A270">
&s;ays,
<Q>The object, <HI>motive</HI> or <HI>rea&s;on</HI> for acting mu&s;t be prior to the action of the mind and <HI>perceived</HI> by it, before it can act.</Q>
<Q>Nothing <HI>can</HI> become an ob|ject, except it appears to be eligible.</Q>
Ibid, p. 95.
<Q>There <HI>mu&s;t appear</HI> &s;ome fitne&s;s or plea&s;ingne&s;s to the mind, antecedent to its choice.</Q>
Ibid. Nothing then can be an object of choice or be cho&s;en, which is not and does not <HI>appear</HI> to be <HI>eligible, fit</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ing.</HI> Now all objects of choice are of two kinds, po&s;itive or neg|ative, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or ab&s;ence of the things propo&s;ed for choice. And things which do not on the whole appear to be eligible, cannot be cho&s;en; then the ab|&s;ence of them being propo&s;ed for choice, is of cour&s;e cho&s;en, and mu&s;t be cho&s;en, becau&s;e it mu&s;t appear eligible. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and the want, the pre&s;ence and the ab&s;ence, of the &s;ame things cannot, upon the whole, be at the &s;ame time eligible: This would im|ply a contradiction.&mdash;To refu&s;e an object is to choo&s;e the ab&s;ence or want of it. Therefore to refu&s;e tho&s;e things which appear to be eligible is impo&s;&s;ible: Of cour&s;e &s;uch things mu&s;t be cho&s;en; there is a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of it, otherwi&s;e that would be cho&s;en, which does not appear to be eligible, which Dr. We&s;t de|clares to be impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing may be more briefly and perhaps more clearly expre&s;&s;ed thus; Dr. We&s;t grants that nothing can be cho&s;en which does not appear to be eligible. Therefore the ab&s;ence of that which appears eligible cannot be cho&s;en, becau&s;e that cannot on the whole appear eligible while the pre&s;ence and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the object appears eligible: And as the ab|&s;ence of the object cannot be cho&s;en, or, which is the &s;ame thing, the object cannot be refu&s;ed; of con&s;e|quence it mu&s;t be cho&s;en; and &s;o there is an infalli|ble connection between motive and volition, and mo|tives nece&s;&s;arily determine the will.</P>
<P>If to this it &s;hould be an&s;wered, that though tho&s;e things, which are not &s;een to be eligible, cannot be|come objects of choice, and therefore we cannot refu&s;e
<PB N="83" REF="032073_0081_0FF1106F401C1F38">
or choo&s;e the ab&s;ence of tho&s;e things which we perceive to be eligible; yet we may not act at all with re&s;pect to them; and may neither choo&s;e nor refu&s;e them; I reply, as I have &s;aid before, that is an impo&s;&s;ibility; there is no medium with re&s;pect to any thing offered as an object of choice, between choo&s;ing and refu&s;ing; neither to choo&s;e nor refu&s;e in &s;uch a ca&s;e is to be block|i&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly in&s;en&s;ible. Or if it be &s;aid, that we only con&s;ider and deliberate on the offer; &s;till we <HI>choo&s;e</HI> to deliberate.</P>
<P N="3">3. According to this pa&s;&s;age, a man can never choo&s;e vice or &s;in. For &s;urely they are neither eligi|ble in them&s;elves, nor in their con&s;equences, and therefore according to this pa&s;&s;age,
<Q>cannot become objects of choice, <HI>i. e.</HI> cannot be cho&s;en.</Q>
But will Dr. We&s;t abide by this? Or if to avoid this con&s;e|quence, the Dr. &s;hould &s;ay, that his meaning is, that a thing which is not <HI>&s;een</HI> or <HI>veiwed,</HI> as eligible in either of tho&s;e re&s;pects, cannot be cho&s;en; I an&s;wer, this implies, that the will in all its acts complies with the dictates of the under&s;tanding, and is nece&s;&s;arily deter|mined by motive, as I have ju&s;t now endeavoured to illu&s;trate; nor, as I can conceive, is there any way to avoid this con&s;equence, but by recurring to what is denied to be po&s;&s;ible, a &s;uppo&s;ed power of the mind, to act or not act at all, and to be perfectly torpid, in view of whatever motives. To take this for granted is a pro&s;trate begging of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P N="5">5. As this pa&s;&s;age holds forth, that the human mind always acts upon motive and cannot act without it, and therefore as is illu&s;trated in a preceding paragraph, is always determined by motive; &s;o it follows, that it is always determined by the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t</HI> motive, that which appears the mo&s;t eligible, or has the greate&s;t previous tendency to induce volition. Surely there can be no motive or rea&s;on to act on a weaker mo|tive in preference to a &s;tronger: This can never appear eligible; and Dr. We&s;t holds, that the mind never acts without &s;ome rea&s;on or motive; without the ap|pearance of &s;omething as eligible.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="84" REF="032073_0082_0FF11070D63D0610">6. As the will is the only active faculty, and the &s;eat of liberty and moral agency, &s;o there is no moral|ity in any other faculty, actions or impre&s;&s;ions, than tho&s;e of the will; and Dr. We&s;t &s;uppo&s;es in this very pa&s;&s;age, as well as el&s;ewhere, that our propen&s;ities and habits do not belong to will. Therefore, provid|ed we <HI>choo&s;e</HI> things, which are for our greate&s;t good, it is of no con&s;equence, as to morality, whether or not
<Q>we find it difficult and impracticable to bring our propen&s;ities to &s;ubmit to our choice; of no more con&s;equence, than whether we can bring our under|&s;tandings to be as acute and comprehen&s;ive, as we may choo&s;e.</Q>
And though we have contracted a wrong habit, if we "choo&s;e to overcome it," it is of no more con&s;equence in a moral view, that we find
<Q>a va&s;t deal of difficulty in our endeavours to overcome it;</Q>
or that we are
<Q>liable to be &s;educed and led a&s;tray by it; than that we find a va&s;t deal of difficul|ty in our endeavours to overcome our ignorance of a&s;|tronomy, and then that we are liable to be led a&s;tray by fal&s;e guides and fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es.</Q>
For &s;o long as our will and choice are right, all in which there is liberty and moral agency, is right, and &s;o long we cannot po&s;&s;ibly be led a&s;tray from our duty. And if our wrong propen&s;ities and habits, under the&s;e circum|&s;tances be not &s;ubdued, it will imply no fault in us, provided, as is &s;uppo&s;ed by Dr. We&s;t, tho&s;e pro|pen&s;ities and habits con&s;i&s;t not in the active or moral faculty or depend not on it: For on this &s;uppo&s;ition they are not of a moral nature and imply nothing mor|ally wrong.</P>
<P N="7">7. Nor is it true, as Dr. We&s;t here a&s;&s;erts, that though we ea&s;ily choo&s;e that which is good, we &s;tand
<Q>in <HI>ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of divine grace, to &s;trengthen us to our duty.</Q>
So far as we choo&s;e that which is good, our wills are right, and our moral part is right. So far therefore we actually do our duty, and have no nece&s;&s;ity of divine grace to &s;trengthen us, to do that which we have done already. Does the Doctor &s;up|po&s;e,
<PB N="85" REF="032073_0083_0FF1109137ABC138">
that our duty calls us beyond our &s;trength? And that it obliges us to act again&s;t <HI>ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.</HI>?</P>
<P N="8">8. Nor if we were to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by divine power to perform any thing beyond the reach of our moral fac|ulties, would there be any <HI>grace</HI> in &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It is <HI>grace</HI> to enable a man to perform his duty; but it is no grace, to enable him to perform that which is not his duty; <HI>e. g.</HI> to fly to the moon.</P>
<P>The Doctor &s;uppo&s;es, that Pre&s;ident Edwards held, that there is always <HI>a rea&s;on for not acting.</HI> No doubt there is always a rea&s;on for the mind's refu&s;ing an ob|ject offered. But Pre&s;ident Edwards never held, that the mind ever &s;inks it&s;elf into perfect inaction and torpor; and of cour&s;e he did not hold, that there is a rea&s;on for this.</P>
<P>The Doctor in&s;i&s;ts, that
<Q>The mind determines <HI>up|on</HI> motives, and is not properly determined <HI>by</HI> mo|tives; p. 87.</Q>
This &s;eems to be a mere di&s;pute about words. The Doctor might as well have &s;aid, that veg|etables grow <HI>upon,</HI> or <HI>in con&s;equence</HI> of the rain, and not <HI>by</HI> the rain. And would it be worth while to di&s;|pute that matter with him?</P>
<Q><L>"Strange &s;o much difference there &s;hould be</L>
<L>"'Twixt <HI>tweedle-dum</HI> and <HI>tweedle-dee.</HI>"</L></Q>
<P>It is con&s;idered by the compilers of the <HI>Encyclopae|dia</HI> lately printed at Philadelphia, as an invincible ar|gument again&s;t the infallible connection between mo|tive and volition, that if equal motives were &s;et before a man to travel an ea&s;tern road and to travel a &s;outh|ern road, he would, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch a con|nection, travel in a diagonal line, to the &s;outhea&s;t. But this is contrary to fact and experience. There|fore they conclude, there is no &s;ure connection be|tween motive and action. They might ju&s;t as conclu|&s;ively have proved, that there is no infallible connec|tion between evidence and the opinions of men. Thus, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the arguments, that the world was created in the &s;pring and that it was creat|ed in autumn, balance each other, the conclu&s;ion
<PB N="86" REF="032073_0084_0FF110AB5BB9D2F8">
mu&s;t be, that it was created in neither of tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, but midway between them. If the arguments, that Dr. We&s;t wrote the E&s;&s;ays on liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, and that &s;ome other per&s;on wrote them, &s;hould be equal; we ought to believe that neither of them wrote them; but a middle man between them.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t, in his &s;econd part, in&s;i&s;ts more largely on the &s;ubject of choo&s;ing between things equally eligible, than in his fir&s;t part; and puts the ca&s;e of four equal lines, one of which is to be touched; and he &s;uppo&s;es that he determines to touch one of them, and this deter|mination he &s;uppo&s;es to be without motive and with|out extrin&s;ic cau&s;e. Now in any &s;uch ca&s;e there ap|pears to be no more difficulty in accounting for my determination to take or choo&s;e one in particular, than there is in accounting for my &s;eeing or thinking of one in particular. Though our thoughts roam freely and apparently without control, yet Dr. We&s;t will not pretend, that they happen by mere chance and without a cau&s;e. Ju&s;t &s;o as to our volitions; they no more happen in any ca&s;e without a cau&s;e, than any other events. Nor can the mind it&s;elf, in which they take place, be the efficient cau&s;e of them, without running into an infinite &s;eries of volitions, and implying volition before the fir&s;t volition.&mdash; Therefore let the Doctor bring as many in&s;tances as he plea&s;es, of things apparently indifferent, &s;o long as choice among them has a cau&s;e, and a cau&s;e extrin&s;ic to the mind too; they make nothing to his purpo&s;e. I a&s;k Dr. We&s;t, Is his determination to touch one of his equal lines, which he calls C, an uncau&s;ed event? He will not pretend it. Is it efficiently cau&s;|ed by the mind it&s;elf, in any other &s;en&s;e, than as the mind is the &s;ubject of it, or as it is the cau&s;e of all its own thoughts and feelings? To an&s;wer in the af|firmative, and not to clear the an&s;wer of the ab&s;urdi|ties and impo&s;&s;ibility charged upon it, is mere dog|matizing.&mdash;To all in&s;tances, in which creatures are &s;uppo&s;ed to choo&s;e one of &s;everal indifferent things,
<PB N="87" REF="032073_0085_0FF1105335370C00">
my an&s;wer is, that though we cannot point out the particular motive or accident, which is the occa&s;ion of the choice of that particular one; &s;till this choice has a cau&s;e, and a cau&s;e extrin&s;ic to the mind too, and it is as ea&s;y to account for our choo&s;ing one of &s;everal indifferent things, as to account for our think|ing of one of them in particular.</P>
<P>But perhaps the Doctor meant to evade this, by &s;aying, that in the very act of determining to touch one of his equal lines, viz. C, he "voluntarily called it to mind." What does the Doctor mean by this? That he fir&s;t wi&s;hed to think of C, and that in con&s;e|quence of this wi&s;h, it came to his mind? If he did mean this, it is to be pre&s;umed, that he will not un|dertake to defend it. And as I can imagine no oth|er meaning of "voluntarily calling C to mind," I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed from further an&s;wer until I am better in|formed. If the Doctor mean, that he wi&s;hed to think of one of his lines, and then C came to his mind; the que&s;tion returns, What made <HI>C</HI> come to his mind?</P>
<P>But the Doctor argues, that the <HI>Creator</HI> has a &s;elf-determining power, and that he does or may exert that power in creating two or more perfectly &s;imilar bodies and in placing them in different &s;ituations, or in cau&s;ing one of them to move, while the other is at re&s;t, &amp;c. As to all &s;uch ca&s;es I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. That every determination of God is as eternal, as unchangeable and nece&s;&s;ary, as his exi&s;tence is, and therefore none of his acts are any more &s;elf-determin|ed, than his exi&s;tence. To &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e is to &s;uppo&s;e that the Deity is mutable. If therefore he have determined to create ever &s;o many bodies per|fectly alike, and to di&s;po&s;e of them in different cir|cum&s;tances, this is no proof of &s;elf-determination in the Deity, if by that term be meant any thing oppo&s;ite to the mo&s;t ab&s;olute and irrever&s;ible moral nece&s;&s;ity: I &s;ay <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity, becau&s;e all nece&s;&s;ity of moral acts, is moral nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="88" REF="032073_0086_0FF110ADEFD9D508">2. If God have created two bodies perfectly alike, and placed them in different &s;ituations; it will not follow, that he has done it without wi&s;e de&s;ign and motive.</P>
<P N="3">3. But why did he not place them in a rever&s;e of &s;ituations, that which is on the right hand, on the left, and that which is on the left hand, on the right? And &s;o with re&s;pect to re&s;t and motion.&mdash;The an&s;wer has been long &s;ince given by Pre&s;ident Edwards: The&s;e bodies, though &s;aid to be numerically different, are no more different than the &s;ame &s;ound repeated at different times. The&s;e &s;ounds are as numerically different as the bodies, and with the &s;ame rea&s;on it may be a&s;ked, why was not the fir&s;t &s;ound made la&s;t and the la&s;t fir&s;t? Or why were not the&s;e numerically different &s;ounds interchanged? The ab&s;urdity of put|ting this que&s;tion mu&s;t appear to every one, becau&s;e it implies, contrary to the very &s;uppo&s;ition, that the &s;ounds are different in &s;ome other re&s;pect than time. So the que&s;tion, why the two perfectly alike bodies were not interchanged in their &s;ituation, implies, con|trary to the &s;uppo&s;ition, that tho&s;e bodies differ in &s;ome other re&s;pect be&s;ide their &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The Doctor &s;ugge&s;ts &s;everal con&s;iderations to &s;how, that the&s;e bodies do differ in &s;ome other re&s;pect be|&s;ide their &s;ituation; as that one of them may be in motion, the other at re&s;t. And what is motion but a change of &s;ituation? So the &s;ame &s;ound may move from one place to another; yet no body would con|clude from that merely, that it was a different &s;ound from a perfectly &s;imilar &s;ound, <HI>i. e.</HI> different from a repetition of the &s;ame &s;ound in a different place or at a different time.&mdash;Al&s;o the Doctor in&s;i&s;ts, that tho&s;e &s;imilar bodies are <HI>numerically</HI> different; that is, they differ in number, &s;o that you may number them, and if you plea&s;e, may call that on the right hand No. 1 or A, and that on the left hand No. 2 or B. And in the &s;ame manner you may number the &s;ounds; and you may as well a&s;k why &s;ound No. 2, was not
<PB N="89" REF="032073_0087_0FF11092C26991A8">
made fir&s;t, as why No. 2 of the bodies was not placed on the left hand. If two bodies be different numer|ically only, they differ in no other re&s;pect, than in &s;ituation; for if they did not differ in &s;ituation, they would become one body.</P>
<P>The Doctor proceeds, p. 15,
<Q>That they [the bodies] are numerically different from each other, appears from this con&s;ideration, that if the globe A, on the right hand, &s;hould he removed to a far di&s;|tant place, the Deity could create another ju&s;t like it, and put it in the &s;ame place from which A was removed.</Q>
So if &s;ound A &s;hould be removed from the place in which it was fir&s;t made to a far di&s;|tant place, the Deity could cau&s;e another &s;ound ju&s;t like it, in the &s;ame place, from which A had been re|moved.&mdash;P. 16.
<Q>It is evident, that the&s;e two globes are as really two, as though they were ever &s;o di&s;&s;imilar.</Q>
This is no more evident, than that the two &s;ounds are as really two, as though they had been ever &s;o di&s;&s;imilar.&mdash;Ibid.
<Q>And they were made to an&s;wer different purpo&s;es; and yet being perfectly &s;imilar, A could have an&s;wered the pur|po&s;es of B and B of A.</Q>
So the &s;ound A may have been made to relieve Saul troubled by an evil &s;pirit; and the &s;ound B may have been made to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of the temple wor&s;hip. Yet being perfectly &s;imilar and indeed no more than the repetition of the &s;ame &s;ound, A could have an&s;wer|ed the purpo&s;e of B, and B of A.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t &s;ays, that Pre&s;ident Edwards, in &s;uppo&s;|ing that two globes perfectly alike, are the &s;ame in every re&s;pect except their &s;ituation, has confounded &s;imilar|ity with identity; p. 16, Part II. Pre&s;ident Edwards does indeed &s;uppo&s;e, that two globes perfectly alike in all re&s;pects except their &s;ituation, are the &s;ame in all re&s;pects except their &s;ituation; and if they could be alike in their &s;ituation too, as they then would be in the &s;ame place, no doubt Dr. We&s;t will grant, that in that ca&s;e they would become one and the &s;ame
<PB N="90" REF="032073_0088_0FF1100C2B0A8248">
globe: If not let him point out in what re&s;pect they would not be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Doctor dwells long on the ca&s;e of the two globes, and yet every thing that he &s;ays to make out, that they are two in any re&s;pect be&s;ide place, may be &s;aid to make out, that perfectly &s;imilar &s;ounds given in different times or places, are not the &s;ame &s;ound re|peated. What he &s;ays, p. 16, may be applied to the ca&s;e of the &s;ounds thus; "What &s;uperiour fitne&s;s has" the &s;ound A, to the &s;ound B,
<Q>that makes it nece&s;&s;a|ry, that it &s;hould be given fir&s;t and be continued in one place?</Q>
"Or what &s;uperiour fitne&s;s has" the &s;ound B to the &s;ound A,
<Q>that makes it nece&s;&s;ary, that it &s;hould be given in the &s;econd place in point of time, and &s;hould be moved to another place in point of &s;ituation?</Q>
<Q>It is certain no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned: For they being perfectly &s;imilar, one cannot in the nature of things be more fit than the other. So then, here are two very different effects of the divine power, without any po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on why &s;ound A &s;hould not be given in the &s;econd place and be moved, and &s;ound B, in the fir&s;t place and not be moved.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctor conceives, p. 17, that the ideas ad|vanced imply,
<Q>that one and the &s;ame body may be in two different places at the &s;ame time.</Q>
No doubt they do imply, that a body which is in all re|&s;pects one and the &s;ame with another body, except &s;ituation, may be in a different place from that other body at the &s;ame time; and may be the &s;ubject of effects different and contrary to tho&s;e, of which that other body may at the &s;ame time be the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>All that the Doctor &s;ays on this &s;ubject, implies, that a body different from another numerically only, differs from it in &s;ome other re&s;pect be&s;ide &s;ituation. But he will doubtle&s;s perceive, that this is an error, if he reflect, that provided the diver&s;ity of &s;ituation were removed and they were at the &s;ame time in the &s;ame place, they would no longer be numerically differ|ent.
<PB N="91" REF="032073_0089_0FF1100DC1602858">
&mdash;Yet Dr. We&s;t &s;ays, p. 17,
<Q>If they differed only in place, then put A in the place of B, and it would become B; and B, by changing with A, would become A; which is not the ca&s;e: For &s;hould we &s;ee A and B change places, &s;till we &s;hould call each by the &s;ame name we did before.</Q>
If you put A in the place of B, it would become B, in the &s;ame and no other &s;en&s;e, than if you make the &s;ound A, in the place and time of the &s;ound B, it will become B. If we &s;hould &s;ee tho&s;e two bodies change their places with each other, &s;till they would be all the while in different places, as much &s;o as two &s;ounds would be, if we &s;hould hear the &s;ound, which is now in this apartment, gradually move to another place, and the perfectly &s;imilar &s;ound, which is now made in the adjoining apartment, gradually move into this apartment. Tho&s;e &s;ounds being all the while thus different in place, do not become in all re&s;pects one &s;ound; the difference of place &s;till remains: And is all the difference of the bodies &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;een to interchange places.&mdash;And if the globes &s;hould be annihilated and then be created anew, and that which is now on the right hand &s;hould be created on the left, and <HI>vice ver&s;a;</HI> this would be as ab&s;urd a &s;uppo&s;ition, as to &s;uppo&s;e, that if the two perfectly &s;imilar &s;ounds now exi&s;ting in this apartment and in the adjoining apartment, &s;hould cea&s;e; that which is now in the adjoining apartment could be renewed in this apartment, and that which now exi&s;ts in this a|partment could be renewed in the adjoining, in the &s;tead of the one which is now there. Every one mu&s;t &s;ee, that this implies, that the &s;ounds are differ|ent from each other, in &s;ome other re&s;pect, than their place; which is contrary to the &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Doctor proceeds, ibid,
<Q>If one of the globes &s;hould be da&s;hed in pieces, it would not in the lea&s;t affect the other, but it would be as whole as it was before.</Q>
So if one of the perfectly &s;imilar &s;ounds made in different places, though at fir&s;t entirely me|lodious,
<PB N="92" REF="032073_0090_0FF110950E7153A0">
&s;hould become har&s;h and grate on the ear, it would not in the lea&s;t affect the other. Yet Dr. We&s;t grants, that the&s;e before the alteration of one, are only the repetition of the &s;ame &s;ound.</P>
<P>The Doctor continues,
<Q>If the two globes were one and the &s;ame in every re&s;pect, except their oc|cupying two places at the &s;ame time, then whatever accident &s;hould take place with re&s;pect to one, would equally take place with re&s;pect to the other: That is, if A be da&s;hed in pieces, B mu&s;t &s;hare the &s;ame fate; which we &s;ee is not the ca&s;e.</Q>
This is &s;aid without proof or rea&s;on given for its &s;upport, and therefore a bare denial is a &s;ufficient an&s;wer. If two &s;ounds in every other re&s;pect one and the &s;ame, &s;hould be made in two places, whatever accident &s;hould take place with re&s;pect to one, might not in the lea&s;t affect the other.</P>
<P>The &s;um of my an&s;wer concerning the two globes, is, That they are no more two, than two perfectly &s;im|ilar &s;ounds made in different places or times; that the &s;uppo&s;ition of their being interchanged, is as ab|&s;urd as the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the two &s;ounds &s;hould be interchanged; that it implies, contrary to what is &s;up|po&s;ed, that they are different from each other, in &s;ome other re&s;pect be&s;ide &s;ituation; and finally, that it is no more in the power of the Deity to interchange them, than to interchange the two &s;ounds.&mdash;If Dr. We&s;t &s;hould reply to this, as he often has done in other ca&s;es, that "this is pa&s;t his power to conceive:" Be it &s;o; what follows? That therefore it cannot be true? And is Dr. We&s;t's &s;kill to conceive the &s;tand|ard of truth?</P>
<P><Q>To &s;ay, that no two things can have equal de|grees of eligibility and fitne&s;s in the divine mind, is to confound the rea&s;on of acting, with action it&s;elf; and to make the Deity a mere pa&s;&s;ive being, or a mechanical medium of fate.</Q>
Part II, p. 19.&mdash; The Doctor has not told how this confounds the rea|&s;on of acting with action, and he mu&s;t not expect,
<PB N="93" REF="032073_0091_0FF11055E7688FE0">
that all his readers will receive it upon his mere a&s;|&s;ertion. It is to be pre&s;umed, that many of them will &s;till believe, that the divine mind always acts accord|ing to the dictates of wi&s;dom, and on account of &s;u|periour fitne&s;s choo&s;es whatever it does choo&s;e, and that this is not to confound the rea&s;on of acting with action, but to pre&s;erve them di&s;tinct.&mdash;If for the Deity to act always voluntarily according to the dic|tates of perfect wi&s;dom, be what the Doctor means by his being "a mere pa&s;&s;ive being," we grant it; but we appeal to the reader, whether the Doctor be not in this ca&s;e guilty of a perver&s;ion of language; or at lea&s;t whether he be not guilty of begging the que&s;|tion, in &s;uppo&s;ing, that there is no action but that which is &s;elf-determinate; as that is manife&s;tly &s;up|po&s;ed in the propo&s;ition now under con&s;ideration.&mdash; As to "the mechanical medium of fate," the reader will &s;ay, whether it be not <HI>mere rant,</HI> unworthy of a grave philo&s;opher and divine.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t frequently &s;ays, and every where takes it for granted, that in the divine mind there may be innumerable things, which differ in many re&s;pects, which yet may have equal degrees of eligibility and fitne&s;s to an&s;wer God's particular purpo&s;es; and among the&s;e innumerable things the Deity can choo&s;e one and not another, and, with re&s;pect to any of them can act or not act.&mdash;That things thus different may be equally fit to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of God is not grant|ed and ought not to have been a&s;&s;erted without proof or in&s;tance. It appears to be a mere conjecture; and if mere conjectures be admitted as truth, truth is the mo&s;t uncertain thing in the world. Be&s;ides, it is very improbable, that things differing in &s;everal re|&s;pects, &s;hould be equally adapted to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e. As to the idea that God can in any ca&s;e act or <HI>not act,</HI> this appears to be an impo&s;&s;ibility, for the rea|&s;ons already mentioned.</P>

<Q>&s;uppo&s;e, that there mu&s;t be a particular rea&s;on why every determination of mind &mdash; is in this partic|ular manner, rather than any other &mdash; which will imply, that there can be no two objects in the mind &mdash; equally eligible.&mdash;The contrary we know to be true by OUR own experience.</Q>

attended to, is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on, why that rather than any of the re&s;t &s;hould be taken or touched: And when this circum&s;tance takes place with regard to any one of &s;everal guineas for in&s;tance, they are not all, or do not appear, equally eligible. That which is the immediate object of &s;ight or attention is, for that rea&s;on, mo&s;t eligible: And how that came to be more particularly the object of &s;ight or attention, I am under no more obligation to account, than Dr. We&s;t or any other man.</P>
<P>It is a &s;entiment entertained by &s;ome, that we ef|ficiently cau&s;e our own volitions, but invariably ac|cording to motives, rea&s;ons or pree&s;tabli&s;hed antece|dents. Dr. Clarke expre&s;&s;es this in various parts of his metaphy&s;ical works; as in the following,
<Q>The true, proper, immediate, phy&s;ical cau&s;e of action, is the power of &s;elf-motion in men, which exerts it&s;elf <HI>freely</HI> in con&s;equence of the la&s;t judgment of the un|der&s;tanding. But the la&s;t judgment of the under&s;tand|ing is not it&s;elf a phy&s;ical efficient, but merely a <HI>moral motive upon which</HI> the phy&s;ical efficient, or motive pow|er begins to act.</Q>
<HI>Being and Attributes,</HI> p. 93.
<Q>The experience of a man's ever doing what he judges rea|&s;onable to do, is not at all an experience of his being under any <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> &s;o to do. For <HI>concomitancy</HI> in this ca&s;e is no evidence at all of phy&s;ical connec|tion. Upon &s;uppo&s;ition of <HI>perfect liberty,</HI> a rea&s;on|able being would <HI>&s;till con&s;tantly</HI> do what <HI>appeared rea&s;onable</HI> it &s;hould do: And its <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> doing &s;o, is no proof at all of its wanting liberty or a phy&s;ical power of doing otherwi&s;e.</Q>
<HI>Remarks on Collins,</HI> p. 25.&mdash;Dr. Price entirely agrees in this &s;entiment with Dr. Clarke.
<Q>A &s;elf-determining power, which is <HI>under no influence of motives</HI> &mdash; has never been contended for or meant by any advocates for liberty.&mdash;Every being who acts at all, mu&s;t act for &s;ome <HI>end</HI> and with &s;ome <HI>view.</HI></Q>

perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with liberty, and indeed &s;uppo&s;es it.</Q>
<HI>Reid on the Active Powers,</HI> p. 275.</P>
<P>On the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages I remark&punc;</P>
<P N="1">1. Dr. Clarke, as well as the other advocates for &s;elf-determination, abundantly contradicts the&s;e &s;enti|ments. Thus in his &s;econd letter to the gentleman at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> &s;peaking of the final perception of the under&s;tanding and fir&s;t operation of the active faculty, he &s;ays,
<Q>I think there is no connection at all be|tween them; and that in their not being connected lies the difference between action and pa&s;&s;ion, which difference is e&s;&s;ential to liberty.</Q>
&mdash;But if a man "on the &s;uppo&s;ition of perfect liberty,"
<Q>con&s;tantly do what appears rea&s;onable; then a man may in a con&s;i&s;tence with perfect liberty con&s;tantly act agreea|bly to the final perception of his under&s;tanding; <HI>i. e.</HI> the final perception of the under&s;tanding and action, or "the operation of the active faculty," may be con|&s;tantly connected con&s;i&s;tently with liberty.</Q>
And i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con&s;tant connection, no connection at all? And if in their not being connected lies the e&s;&s;ence of liberty, the e&s;&s;ence of liberty cannot be con&s;i&s;tent with their con&s;tant connection.</P>
<P N="2">2. That Dr. Clarke places liberty in a <HI>phy&s;ical power</HI> to do an action. His words are,
<Q>A being's con&s;tantly doing what appears rea&s;onable it &s;hould do, is no proof of its wanting liberty or a phy&s;ical power of doing otherwi&s;e.</Q>
He evidently u&s;es <HI>liber|ty</HI> and <HI>phy&s;ical power,</HI> as &s;ynonymous expre&s;&s;ions. Ma|ny other pa&s;&s;ages might be quoted from Dr. Clarke, Dr. Price, and other principal authors of that cla&s;s, in which they expre&s;sly a&s;&s;ert or evidently &s;uppo&s;e, that whoever has a <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> power to do an action, is free; and that the rea&s;on why motives are not incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty, is, that they infer not a phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;i|ty or inability. But this is no more than we all grant. Peter had the &s;ame phy&s;ical or natural power to con|fe&s;s his Lord, which he had to deny him; and Judas, the &s;ame phy&s;ical power to be faithful to him, as to
<PB N="98" REF="032073_0096_0FF11072B6B979C8">
betray him. Nor do the mo&s;t ab&s;olute decrees and predictions de&s;troy this phy&s;ical power. So that ab|&s;olute decrees and predictions are, on this plan, per|fectly con&s;i&s;tent with liberty.</P>
<P N="3">3. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages imply, that though the mind is the efficient cau&s;e of its own volitions; yet this effi|ciency is limited to exert it&s;elf or to be exerted, ac|cording to motives and the dictates of the under|&s;tanding. But this, on the plan of tho&s;e who deny that volition can be free and yet be the effect of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, is no more liberty than the &s;lave exerci&s;es, who moves and acts at the control of his ma&s;ter; or than the man has, who walks in a pri&s;on and who&s;e liberty is bounded and determined by the walls and gates of the pri&s;on, and by the con&s;ent of the gaoler. We might as well &s;ay, that a &s;lave is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his liberty and is not controlled by the will of his ma&s;ter, but controls him&s;elf ac|cording to the will of his ma&s;ter; as that we are free with the liberty of &s;elf-determination and contingence, and yet be always limited to determine our&s;elves ac|cording to the influence of motives. If there be a real connection between motive and volition, that connection is as incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty as if motives were the efficient cau&s;es of volition; provided liber|ty mean contingence or previous uncertainty of ac|tion: And if liberty mean &s;elf-cau&s;ation of volition, and this &s;elf-cau&s;ation be under the control of mo|tives or any extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, &s;till where is liberty in the &s;en&s;e contended for by our opponents? Volition in this ca&s;e is equally limited and controlled, as if it were efficiently produced by motive.</P>
<P>Such &s;elf-determination as this, is not at all incon|&s;i&s;tent with efficacious grace, ab&s;olute decrees, and the mo&s;t firm pree&s;tabli&s;hment of all events and voli|tions. If &s;elf-determination exert it&s;elf according to motives only, let God in his providence bring the proper motives into view, and we are efficaciou&s;ly de|termined, or if you plea&s;e, it is efficaciou&s;ly brought
<PB N="99" REF="032073_0097_0FF1105F0C17A848">
to pa&s;s, that we &s;hall determine our&s;elves in a partic|ular limited manner; and let God decree ab&s;olutely that tho&s;e motives &s;hall come into view, and he ab&s;o|lutely decrees and foreordains what our conduct &s;hall be. So that this kind of &s;elf-determination does not at all an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of avoiding the dread+ful doctrine of ab&s;olute decrees, the fatality implied in that doctrine, or other doctrines connected with it.</P>
<P N="4">4. If a man cau&s;e his own volitions according to motives only, and this be a univer&s;al rule; doubtle&s;s this rule was e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;ome cau&s;e. This rule is an e&s;tabli&s;hment; this e&s;tabli&s;hment is an effect, and requires a cau&s;e as much as any other effect. Who or what is that cau&s;e? It is doubtle&s;s either the Fir&s;t Cau&s;e, or &s;ome &s;ubordinate cau&s;e appointed by him. In either ca&s;e the original cau&s;e of this e&s;tabli&s;hment, by which intelligent creatures cau&s;e their own voli|tions according to motives, is God. Al&s;o be in the cour&s;e of his providence brings all tho&s;e motives into our view, on which we act. And doubtle&s;s both this e&s;tabli&s;hment and the coming of the motives into our view were cau&s;ed by him, in con&s;equence of a previ|ous determination to cau&s;e them. Therefore this &s;cheme of &s;elf-determination not only is con&s;i&s;tent with ab&s;olute decrees and the efficacious providence of God; but it nece&s;&s;arily implies both the&s;e. It nece&s;|&s;arily implies, that God has decreed all our volitions and is either mediately or immediately the cau&s;e of them all. Therefore it is incon&s;i&s;tent, that tho&s;e who e&s;pou&s;e this &s;cheme of liberty and &s;elf-determination according to motives, &s;hould oppo&s;e the doctrines of God's ab&s;olute decrees and efficacious grace.</P>
<P N="5">5. Be&s;ide this, the common ab&s;urdity of &s;elf-deter|mination equally attends this &s;cheme of determining our&s;elves according to motives; I mean the ab&s;urdi|ty of an infinite &s;eries of volitions cau&s;ing one anoth|er. If all free volitions be cau&s;ed by the &s;ubject, that volition in which a man complies with a motive, mu&s;t have been cau&s;ed by him&s;elf and by a preceding vo|lition;
<PB N="100" REF="032073_0098_0FF110B22AD1AF68">
and this la&s;t volition, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, mu&s;t have been cau&s;ed by one preceding that, and &s;o on infinitely.</P>
<P N="6">6. Nor is this all. The doctrine now under con|&s;ideration is, that every volition is according to a mo|tive, and is under the per&s;ua&s;ive influence of it. Therefore every one of that infinite &s;eries of volitions mu&s;t have been put forth in the view of &s;ome motive. So that here we have not only an infinite &s;eries of vo|litions producing one another; but an infinite &s;eries of motives, according to which they do produce one another.</P>
<P>Dr. Reid holds, that
<Q>there are innumerable ac|tions done by a cool and calm determination of the mind, with fore-thought and will, but <HI>without motive.</HI></Q>
<HI>Active Powers,</HI> p. 275. This is directly contrary to Dr. We&s;t. He holds, as before quoted,
<Q>That the infallible connection between motives and volition cannot take place, till the mind has determined to examine the &s;everal motives or rea&s;ons for act|ing&mdash;In that ca&s;e the mind will certainty choo&s;e that which appears the be&s;t; Part II, p. 80; <HI>i. e.</HI> will certainly act <HI>with</HI> motive.</Q>
&mdash;It is equally con|trary to Dr. Reid him&s;elf. In the next page he grants,
<Q>that an action done without any motive can neither have merit nor demerit; and &s;ays, that this is a &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition, and that he knows of no au|thor that ever denied it.</Q>
Now an action in which there is neither merit nor demerit, is not a moral ac|tion. But is not every action done by a cool and calm determination of the mind, with fore-thought and will, a moral action? If it be, &s;ince according to Dr. Reid, &s;uch an action may be done without a motive, it follows, that, directly contrary to what Dr. Reid him|&s;elf a&s;&s;erts, an action done without a motive, can have merit or demerit: Or a moral action may have no merit or demerit in it. Or if an action done by a cool and calm determination of mind, be not a moral action, then in this controver&s;y we have no more to do with it, than we have with the beating of the pul&s;e
<PB N="101" REF="032073_0099_0FF11139CC8016A8">
or winking of the eyes: For this controver&s;y re&s;pects moral actions only.&mdash;Again, in the page la&s;t referred to, Dr. Reid tells us,
<Q>If a man could not act with|out motive, he would have no power at all.</Q>
But if we have a power to act without motive, this power, according to Dr. Reid, does not enable us to do tho&s;e ac|tions, which have either merit or demerit; <HI>i. e.</HI> mor|al actions. Therefore for the purpo&s;es of morality, of virtue and vice, reward and puni&s;hment, &s;uch a power would do us no good. So that according to Dr. Reid, we have no power to perform any moral action. For according to him, power to act with mo|tive only, is no power at all. Therefore whatever power we have, is a power to act without motive. But a power to act without motive, is a power to per|form tho&s;e actions only, which have neither merit nor demerit; <HI>i. e.</HI> which are no moral actions.&mdash;Yet in p. 277, he &s;ays,
<Q>The actions, which are done with|out a motive, are of moment in the que&s;tion con|cerning <HI>moral liberty.</HI></Q>
By <HI>moral</HI> liberty I conclude, he means that liberty, in the exerci&s;e of which we act morally, or with merit or demerit. Therefore que&s;|tions concerning this liberty are que&s;tions concerning <HI>moral</HI> actions. But how can tho&s;e actions, which have no morality in them, be of moment in que&s;tions con|cerning <HI>moral</HI> actions? Can the peri&s;taltic motion or the action of the &s;olids on the fluids in the human con&s;titution, be of moment in a que&s;tion concerning malice or envy?</P>
<P>In the page la&s;t quoted, Dr. Reid &s;ays,
<Q>If we have a power of acting without motive, that power joined to a weaker motive, may counterbalance a &s;tronger.</Q>
What if it may? The action or actions, which &s;hould be the re&s;ult in &s;uch a ca&s;e, would not be of a moral nature. For if an action done entirely without motive be not of a moral nature, as Dr. Reid grants, that which is done again&s;t the &s;tronger motive, being on the whole done without motive, mu&s;t al&s;o be not of a moral nature. As the weaker motive is
<PB N="102" REF="032073_0100_0FF111190A469D80">
with&s;tood and balanced by a part of the &s;trength of the &s;tronger, &s;o far as a man acts again&s;t the exce&s;s of the &s;trength of the &s;tronger, he mu&s;t act without mo|tive. Therefore if a man be influenced by a regard to his duty, as with the force of 1, to pre&s;erve his tem|perance; and be influenced by his appetite, as with the force of 2, to intemperance, and then by a &s;elf-de|termining power determine him&s;elf to temperance again&s;t the &s;tronger motive; there is according to Dr. Reid's own conce&s;&s;ion, no virtue and no morality is the determination. Who then would wi&s;h for &s;uch a power as this? And why did Dr. Reid think it worth his while, to di&s;pute for it? Surely in di&s;puting for it, he &s;pent his time and &s;trength in a very u&s;ele&s;s manner.</P>
<P>Though Dr. Reid holds, as ju&s;t quoted, that
<Q>if a man could not act without motive, he would have no power at all;</Q>
yet he holds, as has been quoted al&s;o, that
<Q>the influence of motives is perfectly con|&s;i&s;tent with liberty and indeed &s;uppo&s;es it.</Q>
And he defines liberty, p. 251, to be
<Q>a power over the determinations of the will.</Q>
Therefore as
<Q>the in|fluence of motives is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>liber|ty</HI> and &s;uppo&s;es it;</Q>
and as
<Q>a power over the de|terminations of the will</Q>
is liberty; the influence of motives is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with
<Q>a power over the determinations of the will:</Q>
And if a man could not act without motive, but always acted under the influence of it, he in the fir&s;t place, "would have no power at all;" in the &s;econd place, he would have &s;ome power; viz.
<Q>a power over the determinations of his own will, which according to him, is <HI>liberty,</HI> and not only is con&s;i&s;tent, with the influence of mo|tive, but is &s;uppo&s;ed in it.</Q>
&mdash;But the defenders of the &s;elf-determining power are fated to incon&s;i&s;tency, and &s;elf-contradiction, and not one of them more &s;o than this Dr. Reid.</P>
<P>He al&s;o holds, that in order to have any power at all, we mu&s;t have a power to act without motive, and
<PB N="103" REF="032073_0101_0FF110EB935F2EC8">
therefore without the influence of motive. But the influence of motive is, according to his own conce&s;|&s;ion, &s;uppo&s;ed in liberty. Therefore to have any power at all, we mu&s;t have a power to act without that which is &s;uppo&s;ed in liberty and therefore without lib|erty it&s;elf: And if we have that which is &s;uppo&s;ed in liberty, and of cour&s;e have liberty it&s;elf, we have no power at all; <HI>i. e.</HI> if we have a power over the deter|minations of our own will, which is liberty; we have no power at all and have no liberty; or if we have power and liberty, we have no power nor liberty.&mdash; But it is endle&s;s to trace the ab&s;urdities of the &s;elf-de|termining power and of the mo&s;t acute writer that ev|er undertook the defence of it. It is indeed a bur|den&s;ome &s;tone, which like that of <HI>Si&s;yphus,</HI> will forever roll down on the heads of tho&s;e who give it a place in their building.</P>
<P>If we have a power to act without motive, we have a power to act without end or de&s;ign; and &s;uch an action is as totally without morality, as the blowing of the wind, or the motion of a cannon-ball: And a power to perform &s;uch an action, is not a power to perform any moral action, nor can &s;uch a power be called <HI>moral</HI> liberty; but it is a power to dive&s;t our|&s;elves, in that action at lea&s;t, of all moral agency.</P>
<P>To choo&s;e any thing without motive, is really a contradiction; it is to choo&s;e it and not choo&s;e it, at the &s;ame time. Whatever is cho&s;en, is cho&s;en as be|ing agreeable in &s;ome re&s;pect or other; and whatever is agreeable, is agreeable either in it&s;elf immediately, or on account of its connection with &s;omething el&s;e and its &s;ub&s;erviency to it, which &s;omething is immedi|ately agreeable in it&s;elf. Now whatever is agreeable on account of its connection with &s;omething el&s;e, is cho&s;en on account of that &s;omething el&s;e, as the mo|tive. Whatever is in it&s;elf agreeable to a man, is cho&s;en from the motive of his appetite, ta&s;te or bias, which is included in Pre&s;ident Edwards's &s;en&s;e of motive. And whatever is not agreeable to a man on one or
<PB N="104" REF="032073_0102_0FF111068C607CD0">
other of the&s;e accounts, is not agreeable at all, and therefore it not cho&s;en.</P>
<P>To choo&s;e an object without motive, is to choo&s;e it without any end or de&s;ign, either of immediate or re|mote gratification of any principle in him, who makes the choice: And whether this be po&s;&s;ible or conceiv|able, I wi&s;h every candid per&s;on to judge.</P>
<P>An act of choice without a motive, in the large &s;en&s;e of motive as defined by Pre&s;ident Edwards, is an event without a cau&s;e: For every cau&s;e of voli|tion is included in Pre&s;ident Edwards's definition of motive. "By motive," &s;ays he,
<Q>I mean the whole of that which <HI>moves,</HI> excites or invites the mind to volition, whether it be one thing &s;ingly, or many things conjunctly; p. 5.</Q>
Accordingly in his fur|ther explanation of his idea of motive, he mentions all agreeable objects and views, all <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> and arguments, and all internal bia&s;es and tempers, which have a ten|dency to volition; <HI>i. e.</HI> every <HI>cau&s;e</HI> or occa&s;ion of volition. And if an immediate divine influence or any other extrin&s;ic influence, be the cau&s;e of volition, it may be called a <HI>motive</HI> in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that a bi|as is. Now, if an act of choice be without motive in this &s;en&s;e, it is ab&s;olutely without a cau&s;e. The eva&s;ion of Doctor Clarke and others, that the mind it&s;elf is the cau&s;e of its own volitions, has been already con&s;idered; be&s;ide other ab&s;urdities, it has been found to lead to an infinite &s;eries of volitions cau&s;ing one another; which is as great an ab&s;urdity, as an infinite &s;eries of men begetting one another.&mdash;Or if it were allowed, that a man does efficiently cau&s;e his own volitions without motive; &s;till he mu&s;t cau&s;e them without de&s;ign or end, and therefore mu&s;t cau&s;e them in the dark and by mere chance.</P>
<P>Archbi&s;hop King in Law's edition, p. 394, &s;ays, "The will cannot be determined to good by objects." Then all the good and evil in the univer&s;e cannot de|termine one act of the will. In p. 354, he &s;ays,
<Q>The more free any one is and the le&s;s liable to ex|ternal
<PB N="105" REF="032073_0103_0FF1110817F8E2F8">
motions, the more perfect he is.</Q>
Therefore the le&s;s liable a man is to be influenced by the di|vine law and its precepts, by the beauty of virtue, by right and wrong, by the divine glory, or by the re|wards and puni&s;hments of virtue and vice here or hereafter; the more perfect he is!!!</P>
<P>If motives have not influence on men they are not capable of moral government. The whole of moral government depends on influencing the &s;ubject by the motives of laws, precepts, penalties, rewards and puni&s;hments, &amp;c.</P>
<P>However, the Archbi&s;hop is perhaps the mo&s;t con|&s;i&s;tent advocate for &s;elf-determination, that has ever written. Clarke, John&s;on, Price and Reid grant too much. They grant, though they do not hold to it throughout, that the will always acts according to mo|tives, and allow the influence of motives; yet they hold, that the will determines it&s;elf and cau&s;es its own acts; which is ju&s;t like the idea of &s;ome concerning the power of the civil magi&s;trate, a power to govern the people, who have the entire government of the magi&s;trate. But Archbi&s;hop King &s;trikes a bold &s;troke. He holds, that there is "a faculty" in human nature
<Q>naturally inclined to exerci&s;e, and that one exerci&s;e is more agreeable than another, not from any nat|ural fitne&s;s in one rather than another; but from the application of the faculty it&s;elf: For another would often be no le&s;s agreeable, if it had <HI>happened</HI> to be determined to that.</Q>
Ibid, p. 269.
<Q>It is the very nature of an <HI>active</HI> power, to make an object agree|able to it&s;elf, <HI>i. e.</HI> good, by its own proper act. For here the goodne&s;s of the object does not pre|cede the act of election, &s;o as to excite it, but elec|tion makes the goodne&s;s in the object; that is, the thing is agreeable becau&s;e cho&s;en, and not cho&s;en becau&s;e agreeable. We cannot therefore ju&s;tly in|quire after any other cau&s;e of election, than the power it&s;elf.</Q>
Ibid, p. 279, 280. It &s;eems then, that it is the nature of a &s;elf-determining power to
<PB N="106" REF="032073_0104_0FF110EDDBCFE368">
exerci&s;e it&s;elf, not in any particular manner, but in any manner and every po&s;&s;ible manner. It pre&s;&s;es like water in a ci&s;tern on every &s;ide alike, endeav|ouring to flow out in exerci&s;e. And whenever it does in fact flow out in any particular exerci&s;e, there was no cau&s;e or rea&s;on for this exerci&s;e, more than for any other po&s;&s;ible exerci&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: The only cau&s;e or rea|&s;on is the natural inclination of this power to flow out in any and all po&s;&s;ible exerci&s;es. This is ju&s;t as good accounting for any particular exerci&s;e of this power as it would be, to account for the Archbi&s;hop's writ|ing his book, by &s;aying, that he had a general power and inclination to write &s;omething or other.</P>
<P>In this &s;cheme of Dr. King, we &s;ee the genuine idea of <HI>liberty of indifference:</HI> It is an equal inclina|tion, previou&s;ly to election, to all po&s;&s;ible elections and volitions, and a perfect indifference to all con|ceivable objects; &s;o that no particular object or &s;it|uation is more &s;uited to give plea&s;ure or mi&s;ery to a man, than another; and plea&s;ure and pain are the con&s;equence and depend entirely on a man's own choice and will; &s;o that it is entirely in a man's pow|er and depends entirely on his own will, to render Nebuchadnezzar's furnace more plea&s;ant, than a bed of down perfumed with ro&s;es.</P>
<P>It is further ob&s;ervable, that according to this account of the &s;elf-determining power, whenever it does exer|ci&s;e it&s;elf, it does it by <HI>mere chance,</HI> or as Dr. King him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it, it <HI>happens</HI> to be determined to that exerci&s;e. Thus we have the famous liberty of contingence or perfect uncertainty, a liberty of blind fate or chance!</P>
<P>Our opponents hold, that the governing influence of motive is incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty and moral agen|cy; then if a man be influenced by any motive to a compliance with the go&s;pel and its precepts, or by any temptation to the commi&s;&s;ion of any action com|monly reputed ever &s;o criminal; in reality there is no virtue in the former nor vice in the latter: Be|cau&s;e
<PB N="107" REF="032073_0105_0FF110E1A54703B8">
the influence of the motive de&s;troys liberty and moral agency, the man is wrought upon by an extrin|&s;ic cau&s;e and therefore is a mere patient and not an agent. Therefore no man needs to be at all afraid of any temptation, nor according to this &s;cheme ought <HI>the Lord's Prayer</HI> to remain any longer without cor|rection: The light of this improved age requires a new edition of it <HI>corrected</HI> and <HI>improved.</HI></P>
<P>If it be objected, that motives do indeed have an influence to per&s;uade men, but not a <HI>certain infallible</HI> influence; I an&s;wer, ju&s;t &s;o far as they have influ|ence, their influence <HI>is</HI> certain and infallible, becau&s;e it is an influence that really exi&s;ts. That which does exi&s;t, <HI>certainly</HI> exi&s;ts, and it is an infallible truth, that it does exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Or if it be pleaded, that the mind is &s;till free, be|cau&s;e motives are not the efficient cau&s;es of volition; I an&s;wer, that the &s;ame plea would prove, that a We&s;t-India &s;lave is free, becau&s;e his actions are not efficiently cau&s;ed by his ma&s;ter or driver, and they only exhibit &s;uch motives as influence the &s;lave him|&s;elf to perform tho&s;e actions: And the &s;ame plea will prove, that moral nece&s;&s;ity is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with liberty. For moral nece&s;&s;ity is a mere previous cer|tainty of a moral action; and this is no more the ef|ficient cau&s;e of the action, than the per&s;ua&s;ive motive, which is the occa&s;ion of an action.</P>
<P>I am entirely willing, that the advocates for the &s;elf-determining power &s;hould take their choice of either Dr. Clarke's &s;cheme of <HI>con&s;tant concomitancy</HI> of mo|tives and volitions; or Archbi&s;hop King's &s;cheme, that motives have no influence, and that previou&s;ly to election all things are perfectly indifferent to the man who makes the election. If they choo&s;e to a|dopt the &s;cheme of <HI>con&s;tant concomitancy,</HI> they at once allow an infallible connection between motives and volition; they mu&s;t give up the power to act or not act, the liberty to either &s;ide, and their favourite ar|gument from choo&s;ing one of &s;everal indifferent things;
<PB N="108" REF="032073_0106_0FF110E49F421340">
they mu&s;t renounce the independence and &s;overeign|ty of the will, and allow that it is as really bounded, limited and controlled by motives, as the &s;lave is by his driver, or as the will is by moral nece&s;&s;ity; and there is nothing of their boa&s;ted liberty left worth contending for, nothing but the pitiful power of man|ufacturing volitions according to the mandates of mo|tives; ju&s;t as a We&s;t-India negro manufactures &s;ug|ar under the la&s;h of his driver.</P>
<P>Or if they choo&s;e Archbi&s;hop King's &s;cheme; ab|&s;urdities no le&s;s glaring will follow. If all things be|fore election be indifferent, then every election is made without motive, rea&s;on, end, de&s;ign or any con|&s;ideration right or wrong; every act of choice is an act of as perfect &s;tupidity, as the motion of a canon ball or the falling of a &s;tone; every man by choice or rejection makes any object either agreeable or dis|agreeable, good or bad, to him&s;elf; every man, in every &s;ituation has the perfect control of his own hap|pine&s;s and mi&s;ery; and it is but for him to choo&s;e to lie on a gridiron, which he can as ea&s;ily do, as choo&s;e any thing el&s;e, and he converts it into a bed of ro&s;es.&mdash;This is &s;elf-determination <HI>to &s;ome purpo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Such exclamations as the following have been made, in relation to this &s;ubject;
<Q>If man be gov|erned by motives, how is he free? Where is free|dom? What liberty has man more than a bea&s;t? All his actions are &s;ubject to a fatal chain of cau&s;es and effects?</Q>
But &s;uch exclamations may ju&s;tly be retorted, on either of the forementioned hypothe&s;es of determining our own volitions agreeably to motives, or without motives. If we determine them agreea|bly to motives only; then we are limited to mo|tives, we can go in one track only, we can act no oth|erwi&s;e than according to the dictates of &s;overeign and all controlling motives. Then
<Q>how is man free? Where is freedom? What liberty has man more than a bea&s;t? All his actions are &s;ubject to a fatal chain of motives.</Q>
&mdash;Or if it be &s;aid, that we de|termine
<PB N="109" REF="032073_0107_0FF110EFDF900078">
our own volitions without motives, end, de|&s;ign or any con&s;ideration good or bad; as in this ca&s;e we act with perfect &s;tupidity, it may with the greate&s;t propriety be demanded,
<Q>How are we free? Where is freedom? What liberty has man more than a bea&s;t?</Q></P>
<P>If there be, as Dr. Clarke, Dr. Price, &amp;c. allow, a con&s;tant concomitancy or connection between motives and volitions; this connection is an e&s;tabli&s;hed law; as really &s;uch, as the connection between a certain temperature of the &s;ea&s;ons and the growth of vegeta|bles. Now of this e&s;tabli&s;hment there is &s;ome author: It is an effect and has an efficient cau&s;e. Nor will it be pretended, that the mind, which is the &s;ubject of the volitions, is the efficient cau&s;e of this e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. This be&s;ide other difficulties attending it, would imply a direct contradiction; as it is now granted, that the mind acts invariably according to motives; and yet in e&s;tabli&s;hing the influence of mo|tives, it mu&s;t act without that influence, <HI>i. e.</HI> without motive. For a motive can have no influence, be|fore influence is given to it; and nothing can be a motive, which has no per&s;ua&s;ive influence or tenden|cy. Therefore the influence of motives and the con|nection between them and volitions, are the effects of &s;ome cau&s;e extrin&s;ic to the mind. And this cau&s;a|tion of the influence and con&s;equences of motives, or of the connection between motive and volition, is really a cau&s;ation of volitions them&s;elves, and that by an ex|trin&s;ic cau&s;e.&mdash;Thus the authors ju&s;t mentioned and tho&s;e who with them acknowledge a con&s;tant con|comitancy of motives and volitions, are brought into a dilemma. If they hold that this concomitancy and con&s;tant connection is cau&s;ed by the mind it&s;elf, they mu&s;t grant, that it is cau&s;ed without motive, and &s;o contradict the very principle they grant, of con&s;tant concomitancy. If they allow, that this connection is cau&s;ed by &s;ome other cau&s;e, than the mind it&s;elf; they mu&s;t of cour&s;e grant, that volitions are the ef|fects of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="032073_0108_0FF1111B4DCB4000">"If volition and agreeable perception," &s;ays Dr. We&s;t, p. 12,
<Q>be one and the &s;ame thing, then mo|tive and volition are one and the &s;ame thing: For nothing can be a motive, but an agreeable percep|tion; or &mdash; motive is the perceiving of the fitne&s;s of an object to an&s;wer a particular purpo&s;e.</Q>
Hence he argues, that
<Q>if motive be agreeable per|ception, and agreeable perception be a volition, and motive be the cau&s;e of an act of the will, then an act of the will is the cau&s;e of an act of the will.</Q>
And that
<Q>motive and volition are one and the &s;ame thing.</Q>
&mdash;No doubt Dr. We&s;t has a right to tell his own &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>motive.</HI> But when Pre&s;ident Edwards has particularly given his &s;en&s;e of that word, and it appears to be entirely different from that of Dr. We&s;t, the Doctor has no right to argue from his &s;en&s;e, to confute the Pre&s;ident. He by motive meant not only a perception of the fitne&s;s of an object to a particular purpo&s;e, but, as has been already ob|&s;erved,
<Q>the whole of that which moves, excites or invites the mind to volition;</Q>
and not only
<Q>the views of the mind,</Q>
but
<Q>the &s;tate, frame, temper and habit of the mind, however cau&s;ed.</Q>
Therefore many volitions may be cau&s;ed or occa&s;ioned by motive in this &s;en&s;e, which are not cau&s;ed by any perception at all, but by appetite, bias, ta&s;te, &amp;c. And if a man perceive ever &s;o clearly the fitne&s;s of an object to an|&s;wer a particular purpo&s;e, and in this re&s;pect its agree|ablene&s;s, this is not the &s;ame as actual choice of that object, all things con&s;idered. A man may perceive, that hard and con&s;tant labour is well fitted to the in|crea&s;e of his property; yet he may not choo&s;e it.</P>
<P>Though it &s;hould be &s;aid, that every agreeable per|ception is a volition; it would not follow, that a vo|lition is a motive to it&s;elf, which is what Dr. We&s;t means, if he mean to fix any ab&s;urdity, in &s;aying, that motive and volition are one and the &s;ame. There is no ab&s;urdity in the &s;uppo&s;ition, that one volition &s;hould be a motive to another volition; that a &s;trong

wi&s;h for honour &s;hould be a motive to determine a man to genero&s;ity, ho&s;pitality, a general good treat|ment of his neighbours, and many &s;ervices u&s;eful to the public; and charity requires us to believe, that a de&s;ire to do good, was the motive, which made Dr. We&s;t willing to write and publi&s;h his <HI>E&s;&s;ays on Liber|ty and Nece&s;&s;ity.</HI>&mdash;The principle from which Dr. We&s;t endeavours to fa&s;ten an ab&s;urdity on Pre&s;ident Edwards, is that nothing can be a motive but an agree|able perception; which is both contrary to truth and contrary to Pre&s;ident Edwards.</P>
<P>Archbi&s;hop King &s;peaks abundantly of "depraved elections." What does he mean by <HI>depraved elec|tions?</HI> Elections not according to truth, rea&s;on or di|vine revelation? But if a man were to choo&s;e accord|ing to the&s;e, he mu&s;t not be per&s;uaded to &s;uch elec|tion by <HI>any regard</HI> to truth, rea&s;on or divine revela|tion; this would imply, that all things were not per|fectly indifferent to him before election, and that &s;ome things are cho&s;en, becau&s;e they are previou&s;ly adapt|ed to excite choice, and not agreeable merely becau&s;e they are cho&s;en, as he holds in places before quoted. Be&s;ides; if a man choo&s;e what is agreeable to truth, rea&s;on or revelation, <HI>from a regard to</HI> truth, rea&s;on or revelation, or which is the &s;ame thing, from the mo|tive of truth, rea&s;on or revelation, he is <HI>per&s;uaded, in|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uenced</HI> and <HI>wrought upon</HI> by tho&s;e motives; con&s;e|quently he is <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> in being the &s;ubject of this influ|ence of the motives, and not free in the &s;en&s;e of free|dom, which the Archbi&s;hop holds&mdash;Again, if a man choo&s;e what is dictated by truth, rea&s;on or revelation, from regard to any thing el&s;e than truth, rea&s;on or rev|elation; as he is influenced by motive, which is the thing which he regards, he is in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e not free. Therefore to be free in that &s;en&s;e he mu&s;t choo&s;e it from no regard to any thing, but without motive, end or de&s;ign. And in &s;uch a choice what there is of depravity or virtue, more than there
<PB N="112" REF="032073_0110_0FF111204F2647D8">
is in the &s;hining of the &s;un or in the blowing of the wind, let any man point out.</P>
<P>Whether there be an infallible connection between motives and volitions or not; &s;till &s;o far as they influ|ence and have effect; &s;o far the &s;ubject is wrought upon by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e and is pa&s;&s;ive; and there|fore according to our opponents, &s;o far his liberty and moral agency are de&s;troyed. Why then &s;hould mo|tives ever be u&s;ed with any man? We ought not to u&s;e them, wi&s;hing that they may have no effect or in|fluence at all. Nor ought we to u&s;e them, to de&s;troy moral agency, and to turn men into machines. For what purpo&s;e then &s;hould we u&s;e them? We common|ly u&s;e them to per&s;uade. But to per&s;uade is to influ|ence a man by motive, which is an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e; and under the influence of motive, he is pa&s;&s;ive; and in &s;uch a ca&s;e our opponents &s;ay his liberty and mor|al agency is de&s;troyed. But if they be not in this way de&s;troyed; an infallible connection between motive and volition is not incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty; and there|fore why &s;hould Dr. We&s;t or any other man di&s;pute again&s;t it?</P>
<P>Mo&s;t, if not all writers in favour of &s;elf-determina|tion allow, that men <HI>generally</HI> act on motive; and I pre|&s;ume they would not deny, that whenever they do act on motive, they are <HI>per&s;uaded</HI> to act <HI>by the motive.</HI> Therefore on their principles, men are generally de|prived of liberty and moral agency, generally act as mere machines and pa&s;&s;ive in&s;truments; and all their objections again&s;t an infallible connection between mo|tives and volition, may be retorted, with re&s;pect to the general conduct of mankind: And as to the liberty and moral agency exerci&s;ed in &s;ome rare in&s;tances, when men act without motive, as when they are &s;up|po&s;ed to choo&s;e between things perfectly indifferent; it is a mere trifle not worth di&s;puting about.</P>
<P>Dr. Price declares (Corre&s;pondence with Prie&s;tly, p. 347,) "That by determining as we plea&s;e," he means,
<Q>our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a power to make either of two
<PB N="113" REF="032073_0111_0FF110F23169C7C0">
motives the &s;tronge&s;t; <HI>i. e.</HI> to make either of them the motive that &s;hall prevail, and the motive on which we &s;hall plea&s;e to determine.</Q>
But this act, by which we make one motive the &s;tronge&s;t, mu&s;t be without motive. If it be not without, but be under the influence of motive, not we, but that prior motive makes that motive &s;tronge&s;t, on which we plea&s;e to determine. And as the compliance with that prior motive is an act in which we determine as we plea&s;e, a &s;till prior motive is nece&s;&s;ary to that act, and we mu&s;t give &s;trength to that motive too, and &s;o on to infinity.&mdash;On the other hand, if without motive we make one motive &s;tronger than another, we in this ca&s;e at lea&s;t act without motive; which is contrary to what Dr. Price abundantly profe&s;&s;es: He &s;ays,
<Q>A &s;elf-determining power which is under <HI>no influ|ence from motives,</HI> has never been meant by any advocates for liberty.</Q>
&mdash;But if we may and do act without motive in making one motive to prevail; why may we not immediately act without motive, as well as fir&s;t without motive make one motive the &s;tronge&s;t, that we may comply with it? Be&s;ides; to give &s;trength to a motive, that we may comply with it, is really, in the act of giving that &s;trength, to com|ply with the motive, and to choo&s;e the object which it recommends. It is like giving money to a friend, that he may procure for us a certain commodity. This certainly implies, that we choo&s;e and wi&s;h for that commodity.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame page Dr. Price puts the que&s;tion;
<Q>Has a man urged by contrary inclinations, no con|trolling power over his inclinations, to make one of them preferably to the other, the inclination which he will follow?</Q>
I an&s;wer, no; there is a contra|diction in it. The &s;uppo&s;ition implies, that before he
<Q>makes one of them the inclination that he will follow, it is not the inclination which he choo&s;es to follow.</Q>
But this is not true: In that he volunta|rily makes it the inclination that he will follow, it is
<PB N="114" REF="032073_0112_0FF1110A5DC3E750">
implied that he is inclined to follow it. He is willing and choo&s;es to follow it, and therefore he voluntari|ly makes it the inclination, which he will follow. Thus it is previou&s;ly what he makes it to be; and he is willing before he is willing. In making it the inclination, which he will follow, he does follow it. He follows it before he follows it.</P>
<P>Dr. Price in the &s;ame book, p. 348, &s;ays,
<Q>I am &s;en&s;ible, that it is non&s;en&s;e, to deny the influence of motives, or to maintain that there are no fixt principles and ends, by which the will is guided.</Q>
Then is it not non&s;en&s;e, to a&s;&s;ert, that we give &s;trength to motives? And that we make an inclination, the inclination that we will follow? This &s;eems to be the inevitable con&s;equence, unle&s;s we give &s;trength to one motive, under the influence of another, and &s;o run in|to the infinite &s;eries.</P>
<P>Dr. Clarke in his Remarks on Collins, p. 12, 13, &s;uppo&s;es, that motives have <HI>&s;ome</HI> influence, but not a prevailing, governing one; and that over and above the per&s;ua&s;ive influence of motives, the &s;elf-determin|ing power mu&s;t by its own force exert it&s;elf to pro|duce volition. Thus, p. 12, he reprobates the &s;uppo|&s;ition, that if a man be not determined by motives nece&s;&s;arily, <HI>i. e.</HI> certainly and really; he can in no degree be influenced by them. But to be influenced by motives, is to be really and effectually influenced, ju&s;t &s;o far as the &s;ubject is influenced by them at all: And &s;o far as he is influenced or per&s;uaded by them, &s;o far is he governed and determined by them: For that is what we mean by a determination by motives. On the other hand, &s;o far as a man is not influenced or determined by motive, he acts without motive and without regard to it. So that there is no medium between no real or per&s;ua&s;ive influence of motive, and a <HI>determining governing</HI> influence.</P>
<P>Again, p. 14, he reprobates the idea,
<Q>that mo|tives and rea&s;ons can be of no weight and no u&s;e at all to men, unle&s;s they <HI>nece&s;&s;itate</HI> them; and that
<PB N="115" REF="032073_0113_0FF1110DE811F328">
if a per&s;on be not determined <HI>irre&s;i&s;tibly,</HI> then he mu&s;t be totally indifferent to all actions alike, and can have no regard to motives and rea&s;ons of ac|tion at all.</Q>
By <HI>nece&s;&s;itating</HI> and <HI>determining irre|&s;i&s;tibly,</HI> if he mean any thing to the purpo&s;e, he mu&s;t mean really and actually to influence by per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;o as to give &s;ome bias or inclination to the will. And it is plain, that if motives do not at all bias or incline the will, the man remains in a &s;tate of total indifference, and
<Q>has no regard to motives or rea|&s;ons of action at all.</Q>
Nor is there any medium between an inclination of the will and total indiffer|ence; for this is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, that there is no medium between an inclination of the will and no in|clination of it. And if "motives and rea&s;ons" do not incline men's wills and have no previous tenden|cy to incline them,
<Q>they are of no weight or u&s;e at all to men; and if a per&s;on be not really inclined by them, he is totally indifferent to them.</Q></P>
<P>In the &s;ame page, the Doctor con&s;iders it as need|ing proof,
<Q>that a &s;elf-moving power is incon&s;i&s;tent with having any regard to rea&s;ons of acting.</Q>
So far as a per&s;on is per&s;uaded to act, by rea&s;ons and motives; &s;o far he is <HI>influenced</HI> by motives, in the &s;en&s;e, in which we hold, that any per&s;on is influenc|ed by them; therefore &s;o far is not &s;elf-determined or &s;elf-moved. Or if by &s;elf-determination be meant, that under the effectual per&s;ua&s;ion of motives, we cau&s;e our own volitions; (though we deny the po&s;&s;i|bility of cau&s;ing our own volitions) yet as to liberty in the &s;en&s;e in which I oppo&s;e it, it would come to the &s;ame. The &s;lave, who always acts by motives exhibited by his ma&s;ter, is as ab&s;olutely controlled by his ma&s;ter, as the whip in the ma&s;ter's hand. Be|&s;ides, to be effectually per&s;uaded by motive to voli|tion, and to cau&s;e our own volition independently of extrin&s;ic influence, is a direct contradiction.</P>
<P><Q>The doing of any thing <HI>upon</HI> or <HI>after</HI> or <HI>in con&s;e|quence of,</HI> that perception (the perception of mo|tive)
<PB N="116" REF="032073_0114_0FF1113D2E3BD4A8">
this is the power of &s;elf-motion or action, which &mdash; in moral agents we call <HI>liberty.</HI></Q>
&mdash; If the doing be merely in con&s;equence of motive, without any <HI>influence</HI> of the motive per&s;uading to the doing; that which in this ca&s;e is called a motive, is very improperly &s;o called. So a motive would be no rea&s;on at all for the doing. If it be a rea&s;on and properly a <HI>motive,</HI> it <HI>moves</HI> the agent to the doing; con&s;equently the doing is not <HI>&s;elf</HI>-motion, unle&s;s &s;elf-motion and motion excited by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e are one and the &s;ame. Nor is this motion a <HI>free action</HI> in a &s;en&s;e oppo&s;ed to moral nece&s;&s;ity. It is not free from extrin&s;ic cau&s;ality, nor of cour&s;e free from a de|pendence on an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e. Every effect is de|pendent on its cau&s;e. Nor is it free with a liberty of contingence. This implies, that &s;omething happens without a cau&s;e.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that motive in this ca&s;e is not the <HI>efficient</HI> of the action or doing: This is granted; but at the &s;ame time, for rea&s;ons already given, it is denied, that the man him&s;elf is the efficient cau&s;e of it. He who e&s;tabli&s;hed the laws of nature, &s;o called, is the primary cau&s;e of all things. What is meant by efficient cau&s;e in any ca&s;e, in which an effect is pro|duced according to e&s;tabli&s;hed laws? For in&s;tance, what is the efficient cau&s;e of the &s;en&s;ation of heat from fire? If it be an&s;wered, fire is the efficient cau&s;e; I al&s;o an&s;wer, that the motive is the efficient cau&s;e of the volition and doing afore&s;aid. If it be &s;aid, that the Great Fir&s;t Cau&s;e is the efficient of the &s;en&s;ation of heat; the &s;ame Great Agent is the efficient cau&s;e of volition, in the &s;ame way, by a general law e&s;tabli&s;h|ing a connection between motives and volitions; as there is a connection between fire in certain &s;ituations and the &s;en&s;ation of heat.</P>
<P>To allow, that we are free, though we always act in con&s;equence of motives, unle&s;s by acting be meant an action not excited or influenced by motive, and of which the motive is no rea&s;on, is to plead for no oth|er
<PB N="117" REF="032073_0115_0FF1111045690E38">
liberty, than is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity and with ab&s;olute decrees.</P>
<P>Doctors Clarke and Price con&s;ider the man free, who efficiently cau&s;es his own volitions according to motives, becau&s;e he him&s;elf and not the motives, is the efficient cau&s;e. Yet as by the &s;uppo&s;ition he cau&s;es them according to motives, he is limited by them. And is a &s;lave free, who manufactures a com|modity under the control and la&s;h of his ma&s;ter? Or is the convict free, who him&s;elf walks around the &s;take, to which he is chained? Yet according to the &s;y&s;tem of the &s;aid gentlemen, the &s;lave and not the ma&s;ter is the efficient cau&s;e of his own volition to labour. The convict and not the &s;take, is the efficient cau&s;e of his own volition to walk around the &s;take. Nor is the ma&s;ter the efficient cau&s;e of the limitation of the vo|litions of his &s;lave; he merely exhibits the motives to their limitation: And it will not be pretended, that the &s;take is the efficient cau&s;e of the limitation of the volition of the convict.</P>
<P>Dr. Price, in Corre&s;pondence with Prie&s;tly, p. 341, &s;ays,
<Q>that no influence of motives, which is &s;hort of making them phy&s;ical efficients or agents, can cla&s;h with liberty.</Q>
Now the walls, gates and bars of a pri&s;on are not <HI>phy&s;ical efficients or agents,</HI> yet they are as incon&s;i&s;tent with the liberty of the pri&s;oner, as if they were &s;uch efficients and agents, and &s;tood around him with gun and bayonet, to confine him to the &s;pot; or as if they had built and made them&s;elves for the purpo&s;e of his confinement. So if man be limited to act agreeably to motives only, they are as incon&s;i&s;tent with his liberty, as they would be, if they were intelli|gent agents, had created them&s;elves and had e&s;tabli&s;h|ed the connection between them&s;elves and volition. It is as to liberty, immaterial who or what has e&s;tab|li&s;hed the connection between motives and volitions, provided the connection be infallibly e&s;tabli&s;hed: As it is immaterial as to the liberty of a pri&s;oner, who or what made the walls, gates and bars of the pri&s;on,
<PB N="118" REF="032073_0116_0FF110F4D800DDF0">
whether the walls, gates and bars them&s;elves, any ex|trin&s;ic cau&s;e, or even the pri&s;oner him&s;elf. If he had built and made them all, had locked him&s;elf in and had flung the key through the grates, he would be as effectually deprived of his liberty, as if the &s;ame things had been done by any other agent.&mdash;The&s;e ob&s;er|vations lead to a further an&s;wer to the plea, that we give &s;trength to the motive which determines us. What if a man &s;hould give &s;trength to a motive? Af|ter it is thus become &s;trong, it as effectually governs the man, and as really deprives him of his liberty, as if it had derived its &s;trength from any other &s;ource. Suppo&s;e a man were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of creating power, and &s;hould create another man &s;tronger than him&s;elf, and this other man &s;hould bind the former hand and foot: Would he not be as effectually deprived of his liberty, as if he had been in the &s;ame manner bound by any other man?</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER V. In which it is inquired, whether Volition be an Effect and have a Cau&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THE title of Dr. We&s;t's &s;econd <HI>e&s;&s;ay</HI> is,
<Q>That vo|lition is not properly an effect, which has a cau&s;e.</Q>
Whether his meaning be, that it is an ef|fect which has no cau&s;e, or that it is not an effect at all, the words do not determine; but from the &s;equel I conclude, the latter is his meaning. This, as has been already noticed, is indeed contradicted by the Doctor, as in this pa&s;&s;age, p. 24,
<Q>The modification in que&s;tion (<HI>i. e.</HI> the modification which the mind gives it&s;elf in willing or acting, which the Doctor explains to be volition) is the con&s;equence or EFFECT of the mind willing or choo&s;ing.</Q>
Then volition is an <HI>ef|fect;</HI> and an effect of a preceding volition.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume the Doctor has the merit of originality in this part of his &s;y&s;tem. Many things in the common &s;cheme of &s;elf-determination do indeed imply, that vo|lition has no cau&s;e; viz. Liberty as oppo&s;ed to all nece&s;&s;ity or certainty; the &s;overeignty and indepen|dence of the will; its exemption from all influence of motive or extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, &amp;c. Still I have not met with one writer before Dr. We&s;t, who had boldne&s;s enough expre&s;sly to avow the &s;entiment. Dr. Clarke and all the re&s;t hold, that volition is the effect of the mind it&s;elf in the exerci&s;e of its &s;elf-moving or &s;elf-de|termining power. And Doctor Price, when charged by Dr. Prie&s;tly with holding, that volitions come to pa&s;s without a cau&s;e, rejects the imputation and takes it hardly, that ever it &s;hould have been made to him or his &s;y&s;tem. Corre&s;pondence with Prie&s;tly, p. 349.</P>
<P>But let us examine the rea&s;ons, by which Dr. We&s;t endeavours to &s;upport this doctrine. They are the following;</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="120" REF="032073_0118_0FF11122A144A1D0">1. That volition is an ab&s;tract term and &s;ignifies &s;omething, which cannot exi&s;t without a &s;ubject; or volition is nothing but the mind willing or acting; and therefore is not an effect; p. 21.&mdash;But &s;uppo&s;e vo|lition be nothing but <HI>the mind willing</HI> or <HI>acting;</HI> is that &s;tate of the mind or the mind in that &s;tate, not an effect? Dr. We&s;t will not deny, that the mind ab&s;o|lutely con&s;idered is an effect. If then the mind <HI>will|ing</HI> or in the exerci&s;e of volition, is not an effect; it &s;eems, that the mind while without volition is an effect or a creature; but in the exerci&s;e of volition cea&s;es to be an effect, and therefore cea&s;es to be a creature. Will Dr. We&s;t avow this?&mdash;Motion is an ab&s;tract term and &s;ignifies &s;omething, which cannot exi&s;t with|out a &s;ubject; or motion is nothing but a body mov|ing. But will it hence follow, that motion or a body moving is not an effect? No more does it follow from the argument of Dr. We&s;t now under con&s;ideration, that volition is not an effect? The Doctor grants, that volition is the modification or mode of the mind; and is not that mode an effect? If it be not an effect, be|cau&s;e it is a mode of the mind, then doubtle&s;s no oth|er mode of the mind is an effect. And &s;trip the mind of all its modes, and you will take away the mind it|&s;elf; becau&s;e &s;ome of tho&s;e modes are <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> modes. If all the modes of the mind, e&s;&s;ential and accidental, taken &s;ingly and collectively, be not effects; the mind it&s;elf is not an effect.&mdash;On the principle of Doctor We&s;t's argument, no mode whatever is an effect. The principle is this, That whatever cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t of it&s;elf out of any &s;ubject, is not an effect. But no mode, &s;o|lidity, exten&s;ion, figure, colour or motion, can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without a &s;ubject. Therefore not one of them nor any other mode is an effect. And if not one of tho&s;e modes by it&s;elf, is an effect, all of them taken together are not an effect; and therefore body or matter is not an effect: Yea neither matter nor &s;pirit is an effect. And as matter and &s;pirit with their modes, comprehend the whole creation; it will follow,
<PB N="121" REF="032073_0119_0FF11125099F5D18">
that no <HI>creature</HI> is an effect; <HI>i. e.</HI> no creature is a creature.</P>
<P N="2">2. That volition or the mind willing, is not an ef|fect, becau&s;e it is an efficient cau&s;e.&mdash;Dr. We&s;t be|lieves, that a carpenter is the efficient cau&s;e of a &s;hip&punc; And does he therefore believe, that the carpenter in building the &s;hip is not a creature? This would fol|low on the principles of this argument. The princi|ple is, that whatever is an efficient cau&s;e, cannot be an effect. Therefore as a carpenter is the efficient cau&s;e of a &s;hip, he is not an effect, or not a creature. Dr. We&s;t and others take it for granted, that if voli|tion be an effect, it cannot be a cau&s;e. This is ju&s;t as ab&s;urd as to hold, that unle&s;s a carpenter be un|cau&s;ed, he cannot build a &s;hip; and that a creature can be the cau&s;e of nothing.</P>
<P N="3">3. That if the operation or action, which is e&s;&s;en|tial to the idea of a cau&s;e, be it&s;elf an effect; then its cau&s;e mu&s;t operate to produce the &s;aid effect; and con&s;equently the la&s;t mentioned operation being an effect, mu&s;t have another cau&s;e to produce it, and &s;o on <HI>in infinitum;</HI> and this infinite &s;eries of cau&s;es and effects entirely excludes the fir&s;t cau&s;e and any efficient cau&s;e; p. 22.&mdash;But it is denied, that in the ca&s;e here &s;uppo&s;ed, an infinite &s;eries of cau&s;es and effects is involved. Suppo&s;e it be true, that the ac|tion which is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a man an efficient cau&s;e, be the effect of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e; how does it follow, that there mu&s;t be, in this ca&s;e, an infinite &s;eries of cau&s;es? We maintain that action may be the effect of a divine influence; or that it may be the ef|fect of one or more &s;econd cau&s;es, the fir&s;t of which is immediately produced by the Deity. Here then is not an infinite &s;eries of cau&s;es, but a very &s;hort &s;e|ries, which terminates in the Deity or fir&s;t cau&s;e.&mdash; I know that it is often <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;erted</HI> by Dr. We&s;t, that volition cannot be an effect at all; and that it is <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> by all others, who maintain Dr. We&s;t's general &s;cheme, that it cannot be an effect of an ex|trin&s;ic
<PB N="122" REF="032073_0120_0FF110F80518BBB8">
cau&s;e. But their &s;uppo&s;ing it is a mere a&s;&s;ump|tion of the thing in di&s;pute, in this part of the argu|ment. Let them <HI>prove</HI> it and they will do &s;omething to the purpo&s;e.&mdash;Again; the cau&s;e or &s;eries of cau&s;es, which is implied in the idea, that volition is an effect, is &s;o far from excluding the fir&s;t cau&s;e and any efficient cau&s;e, as Dr. We&s;t &s;ays, that it inevitably leads to the fir&s;t cau&s;e, and implies, that there is an efficient cau&s;e of all volition in creatures, as well as of every thing el&s;e &s;hort of the fir&s;t cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. That volition in the Deity is no effect, but is on|ly the Deity con&s;idered as willing or cau&s;ing; and therefore to a&s;&s;ert, that volition is no effect, is not in it&s;elf an ab&s;urdity. Why then may we not a&s;&s;ert, that volition in the creature is no effect? P. 23.&mdash;On this I ob&s;erve, It is granted, that volition in the Dei|ty is not an effect; but it no more hence follows, that volition in the creature is not an effect, than that ex|i&s;tence and knowledge in the creature, are not effects, becau&s;e they are not effects in the Creator.</P>
<P N="5">5. That if human volition be an effect, then man mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ive in willing, but if he be pa&s;&s;ive in willing, he can be active in nothing el&s;e; <HI>i. e.</HI> he is no agent, but a mere pa&s;&s;ive machine. But if man be active in willing, then volition cannot be the effect of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, and will be nothing but the mind acting or operating; p. 23. &mdash;No doubt if human volition be an effect, man is &s;o far pa&s;&s;ive in willing, as to be the &s;ubject of the influence of that cau&s;e which produces volition; &s;till he is active too in volition, is &s;till an agent and not a <HI>mere</HI> pa&s;&s;ive machine. In volition man is both pa&s;&s;ive and active; pa&s;&s;ive as he is the &s;ubject of the influence of the cau&s;e which excites volition, and active in the exerci&s;e of it. As the day-labourer is pa&s;&s;ive in that he is influ|enced by the pro&s;pect of wages, to con&s;ent to labour, and active in exerting and in con&s;enting to exert him|&s;elf in labour. Nor does it follow from a man's being active in volition, that volition cannot be the effect of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e. The idea, that it does follow, takes
<PB N="123" REF="032073_0121_0FF11128661B4B78">
for granted the very thing in que&s;tion, viz. that an ac|tion cannot be an effect, e&s;pecially of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e. Dr. We&s;t ought to have proved this.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; why does the Doctor &s;ay,
<Q>If man be active in willing, then volition cannot be the effect of any <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e?</Q>
Ibid. His doctrine equally implies, that it is not the effect of an <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e. His doctrine is, that volition is, in general terms, not an effect and has no cau&s;e. But now, it &s;eems the Doctor recedes from this, and holds only, that voli|tion is not the effect of an <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e, implicitly granting, that it is <HI>an effect,</HI> and an effect of an <HI>intrin|&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The Doctor tells us, that
<Q>if man be pa&s;&s;ive in willing &mdash; he is&mdash;a <HI>mere pa&s;&s;ive machine</HI>; p. 23.</Q>
&mdash;How does this appear? A man is pa&s;&s;ive in his intellectual views; but is he in tho&s;e views a mere pa&s;&s;ive <HI>machine?</HI> The human intellect is very different from what we commonly call a <HI>machine.</HI> Or if by <HI>machine</HI> the Doctor mean any thing that is influenced by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e; I grant, that in this &s;en&s;e, both the human intellect and human will are <HI>machines;</HI> and in granting this, I grant no more than is implied in the moral nece&s;&s;ity for which I plead. Yet &s;uch an application of the word <HI>machine,</HI> would be a gro&s;s perver&s;ion of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the Deity has not only acted from all eter|nity; but is continually acting upon the whole crea|tion, for the pre&s;ervation and government of it. Yet the&s;e operations and energies of the Deity are not ef|fects, though they take place in time. Therefore the energies or volitions of the human mind are not ef|fects, though they al&s;o take place in time; p. 24.&mdash; But I deny, that the operations or energies of the Deity <HI>begin</HI> in time, though the effects of tho&s;e opera|tions do. They no more begin in time, than the di|vine exi&s;tence does; but human volitions all begin in time. There is no &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the divine mind; therefore no new operations take place there. All
<PB N="124" REF="032073_0122_0FF1113F411CFD08">
the divine acts are equally from eternity, nor is there any <HI>time</HI> with God.
<Q>One day is with the Lord as a thou&s;and years and a thou&s;and years as one day.</Q>
The <HI>effects</HI> of tho&s;e divine acts do indeed all take place in time and in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.&mdash;If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that on this &s;uppo&s;ition the effects take place not till long after the acts, by which they are produc|ed; I an&s;wer, they do &s;o in our view, but not in the view of God. With him there is no time, no before nor after with re&s;pect to time; nor has time any ex|i&s;tence either in the divine mind or in the nature of things, independently of the minds and perceptions of creatures; but it depends on the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e perceptions. So that from the con&s;ideration, that the divine energies and operations are no effects, it no more follows, that human volitions are no ef|fects, than from the con&s;ideration that the divine ex|i&s;tence and knowledge are no effects it follows, that <HI>our</HI> exi&s;tence and knowledge are no effects.</P>
<P N="7">7. That if volition were an effect, we could not be the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of any effects: At the mo&s;t we &s;hould be <HI>mere pa&s;&s;ive in&s;truments;</HI> p. 25.&mdash;This wholly de|pends on the meaning of <HI>words,</HI> as mo&s;t of Dr. We&s;t's arguments do. If by <HI>cau&s;e</HI> the Dr. mean a <HI>&s;elf-deter|minate</HI> cau&s;e, he, <HI>as u&s;ual,</HI> begs what he has no right to expect will be given him. But if by <HI>cau&s;e</HI> he mean a rational, voluntary agent, acting under the per&s;ua|&s;ive influence of light and motives; we may be &s;uch cau&s;es, though volition is an effect; and acting as &s;uch cau&s;es we may produce effects. Thus Noah built the ark; Mo&s;es hewed two tables of &s;tone, &amp;c.&mdash;And if under the name of a <HI>pa&s;&s;ive in&s;trument</HI> the Doctor mean to include &s;uch a rational, volunta|ry agent, as I have ju&s;t de&s;cribed; I grant, that in this &s;en&s;e we are pa&s;&s;ive in&s;truments, and it is impo&s;&s;i|ble, that a rational creature &s;hould be any other than &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ive in&s;trument. But I reprobate the call|ing of &s;uch an agent a mere pa&s;&s;ive in&s;trument, as a great abu&s;e of language.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="032073_0123_0FF111425ABA0A80">But &s;uppo&s;e volition were not an effect; &s;hould we then be cau&s;es of effects? or &s;hould we then be le&s;s pa&s;&s;ive in&s;truments? If volition were no effect, we our&s;elves &s;hould no more be the cau&s;es of it, than any extrin&s;ic cau&s;e. It would happen in us by mere chance. And &s;hould we in the exerci&s;e of that voli|tion, which is without cau&s;e and is merely accidental, be any more cau&s;es of an effect, than we &s;hould be in the exerci&s;e of a volition excited by a proper mo|tive? If any rea&s;on can be given to &s;how, that we &s;hould, let it be given. Though it may be pleaded, that when we become the &s;ubjects of volition by mere chance, we are not the &s;ubjects of the operation of a cau&s;e in the production of volition, and in that &s;en&s;e are not pa&s;&s;ive; yet in this ca&s;e volition takes place in our minds equally without our cau&s;ation, our pre|vious agency or con&s;ent, as if the &s;ame volition were cau&s;ed by &s;omething extrin&s;ic. So that if we be not equally <HI>wrought upon</HI> in the&s;e two ca&s;es, we are e|qually <HI>inactive,</HI> and therefore can no more be <HI>cau&s;es</HI> in the one ca&s;e, than in the other: And there is nothing more favourable to liberty or &s;elf-determina|tion in the one ca&s;e than in the other.</P>
<P N="8">8. That if volition were an effect, we could have no more ideas of cau&s;e and effect, than a blind man has of colours. For we being pa&s;&s;ive in our ideas of &s;en&s;ations, they could never &s;ugge&s;t to us the ideas of cau&s;e and effect; and if volition or internal action be the effect of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, our reflections could never afford an example of an efficient cau&s;e, and &s;o we mu&s;t for ever be de&s;titute of the ideas of cau&s;e and effect; p. 25.&mdash;On this I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) It wholly depends on the meaning of the word <HI>cau&s;e.</HI> If as I before ob&s;erved, it mean a &s;elf-determin|ate cau&s;e, which "acts on it&s;elf and produces voli|tion;" I grant, that we have no idea of &s;uch a cau&s;e, more than a blind man has of colours. Nor has Dr. We&s;t any idea of &s;uch a cau&s;e, as he reprobates it and does not believe in its exi&s;tence. Neither God
<PB N="126" REF="032073_0124_0FF1112B0B988568">
nor creature can be &s;uch a cau&s;e as this; it is an im|po&s;&s;ibility; it is perfectly like the animal, which Pre&s;ident Edwards &s;uppo&s;ed the traveller profe&s;&s;ed to have &s;een in <HI>Terra del fuego.</HI> But if cau&s;e mean a rational. voluntary agent producing effects under the influence of motives; &s;uch cau&s;es we our&s;elves are or may be; and the idea of &s;uch a cau&s;e we derive from every artificer, whom we &s;ee employed at his trade, from every hu&s;bandman, who in our view tills the ground, and from every external action which we perform.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Though we are pa&s;&s;ive in our ideas of &s;en&s;a|tion, yet every idea of that kind, for the very rea&s;on that we are pa&s;&s;ive in it, &s;ugge&s;ts to us the ideas of both cau&s;e and effect. In that we are pa&s;&s;ive in tho&s;e ideas both cau&s;e and effect are implied. If no cau&s;e operated upon us to produce the effect, &s;en&s;ation, we &s;hould not be pa&s;&s;ive in &s;en&s;ation. It is true, the be|coming pa&s;&s;ively the &s;ubjects of &s;en&s;ation, does not &s;ugge&s;t to us the idea of a &s;elf-determinate or &s;elf-ac|tuating cau&s;e; for &s;uch a cau&s;e does not exi&s;t, is an impo&s;&s;ibility, and therefore no idea of it can be con|ceived; as I have already endeavoured to &s;how.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) This argument &s;uppo&s;es, that we get the idea of an efficient cau&s;e by the experience, that we our|&s;elves are the efficient cau&s;es of volition. But in the fir&s;t place we deny, that we ever do experience our&s;elves to be the efficient cau&s;es of volition: And in the &s;econd place, if we did, it would be entirely incon&s;i&s;tent with Dr. We&s;t's propo&s;ition now under con&s;ideration; it would prove, that volition is an ef|fect, and that we our&s;elves are the efficient cau&s;es of it.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) Be it &s;o that
<Q>our reflections can never afford us an example of an efficient cau&s;e; what ab|&s;urdity follows?</Q>
We avow that our reflections can|not afford us an example of &s;uch a cau&s;e. We nei|ther efficiently cau&s;e our own volitions nor our own perceptions. Yet we are not de&s;titute of ideas of
<PB N="127" REF="032073_0125_0FF11144B0287208">
cau&s;e and effect, as I have already &s;hown.&mdash;But certainly according to Dr. We&s;t our reflections do not afford us an example of an efficient cau&s;e of vo|lition; for volition is, according to him, no effect and has no cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="9">9. That if our volitions were the effects of an extrin|&s;ic cau&s;e, we could never have the idea of dependence and independence, and therefore could not connect our ideas together, <HI>i. e.</HI> could not be rational beings. And as we are rational beings, it follows, that our volitions are not the effects of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, but that we are &s;elf-determinate, and that we get the ideas of de|pendence and independence, by experiencing in our|&s;elves, that in willing and choo&s;ing we act independ|ently of any extrin&s;ic cau&s;e; p. 25.</P>
<P>This implies, that in volition we act independently, and that from &s;uch independent actions we derive the idea of independence. But this again is a &s;heer beg|ging of the que&s;tion. How does it appear, that we act independently? The Doctor might as well have taken it for granted, that we act &s;elf-determinately. We no more grant, that we acquire the idea of inde|pendence, by experiencing it in volition, than that we acquire the idea of an efficient cau&s;e by experiencing our&s;elves to be the efficient cau&s;es of our own voli|tions. And if any man have the idea, that any crea|ture is in volition independent of all extrin&s;ic cau&s;es, this idea is not allowed to be according to truth. As to the divine independence, which is indeed entire and ab&s;olute, Dr. We&s;t will not pretend, that we get the idea of this by experiencing the like independ|ence in our&s;elves. We no more get that idea in this way, than we get the idea of the divine omnipotence, by experiencing omnipotence in our&s;elves. So that though we have the ideas of dependence and inde|pendence, can connect our ideas together and are ra|tional beings, it by no means follows, as Dr. We&s;t in|fers,
<Q>that our volitions are not the effects of an <HI>ex|trin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e, and that we are &s;elf-determinate.</Q>

And why does the Doctor continually deny volition to be the effect of an <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e? The propo&s;i|tion which he has undertaken to &s;upport, equally im|plies, that it is not the effect of an <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="10">10. That volition is only the relation of the energy of a cau&s;e in producing an effect, and therefore is not an effect, and has no proper exi&s;tence of its own; p. 26.&mdash;If volition be only the <HI>relation</HI> of the energy of a cau&s;e, it is not the <HI>energy</HI> it&s;elf or <HI>action</HI> of a cau&s;e; and how then is it a part of the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent inquiry? The pre&s;ent inquiry and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion relate to the voluntary <HI>actions</HI> of a rational being. As to the relations and external denominations of tho&s;e actions, they may be and commonly are different in every action, yet the actions them&s;elves may be the &s;ame.&mdash;Be&s;ides; the Doctor will not pretend to de|ny, that volition is an action of the mind, or as he choo&s;es to expre&s;s it, <HI>the mind acting.</HI> And is the mind acting only the relation of the energy or action of that mind? And has the mind acting
<Q>no proper exi&s;tence of its own?</Q>
If it have, it is an effect doubtle&s;s, becau&s;e it is a creature. An action of the human mind is an event, and an event coming to pa&s;s in time, and therefore has a cau&s;e: And Dr. We&s;t &s;ays, he
<Q>cannot be charged with holding, that events take place without a cau&s;e; p. 27.</Q></P>
<P N="11">11. That no agent can bring any effect to pa&s;s, but what is con&s;equent on his acting. Therefore it is very ab&s;urd to call the acting or activene&s;s of a being, an effect; becau&s;e it introduces the utmo&s;t ab&s;urdity in|to language, by confounding and blending things to|gether, which are very different; p. 28.&mdash;It is an undoubted truth, that no agent can bring any effect to pa&s;s, but what is con&s;equent on his acting. But how does it hence follow, that it is very ab&s;urd to call the action of a being an effect? And how does this confound and blend things together, which are very dif|ferent? It will not be denied, that the prophe&s;ying of a prophet may be the act of that prophet; yet acting

by in&s;piration he is excited to that act by a divine agency. No doubt the Divine Being brings to pa&s;s this effect by a previous act or exertion of him&s;elf. But where is the ab&s;urdity of calling this prophe&s;ying an effect of the divine influence? How does the call|ing of it &s;o, confound and blend the divine influence and the act of the prophet, which are acknowledged to be very different from each other?</P>
<P N="12">12. That cau&s;e and effect are not &s;ynonymous terms; and therefore
<Q>in whatever &s;en&s;e any thing is a cau&s;e, in that &s;en&s;e it is not proper to call it an effect; for this rea&s;on, that cau&s;es con&s;idered as cau&s;es, are not effects.</Q>
Part II, p. 90. This is ju&s;t as conclu&s;ive rea&s;oning as if the Doctor had &s;aid, the words <HI>tree</HI> and <HI>effect</HI> are not &s;ynonymous terms. Therefore in whatever &s;en&s;e any thing is a <HI>tree,</HI> in that &s;en&s;e it is not proper to call it an <HI>effect;</HI> for this rea&s;on, that <HI>trees</HI> con&s;idered as <HI>trees</HI> are not <HI>effects.</HI> Rain con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of the growing of gra&s;s, is an effect; a medicine con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of a cure, is &s;till an effect; and Dr. We&s;t con&s;idered as the author of &s;everal e&s;&s;ays on liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, is as really a creature of God, as he is when he is con&s;idered to be in the exerci&s;e of his favourite liber|ty or power of <HI>not acting</HI> and is in perfect <HI>torpor.</HI>&mdash; The Doctor proceeds,
<Q>The mind acting is the mind cau&s;ing; for I conceive, whenever the mind acts, it produces &s;ome effect.</Q>
Ibid. If the Doctor mean that whenever the mind is the &s;ubject of an <HI>internal</HI> act or volition, it produces &s;ome <HI>external</HI> effect; this is manife&s;tly a mi&s;take, and the Doctor him&s;elf will not avow it. If he mean, that whenever it is the &s;ub|ject of volition, it produces that volition as an <HI>effect;</HI> this in the fir&s;t place is giving up what he him&s;elf had written an e&s;&s;ay to prove, viz. that volition is not an effect; and &s;econdly it is a begging of the main point. In &s;hort, Dr. We&s;t is a mo&s;t &s;turdy metaphy&s;ical beg|gar. But as charity demands no gratuities to &s;uch beggars, he is to expect none.&mdash;He adds to the

la&s;t quotation, it
<Q>will introduce the greate&s;t confu|&s;ion in language, to &s;peak of the mind, con&s;idered as cau&s;ing, as being an effect.</Q>
But what confu&s;ion of language is it, to &s;peak of Dr. We&s;t con&s;idered as the author of e&s;&s;ays on liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, as being a creature? I hope, when the Doctor &s;hall write again, he will <HI>&s;how</HI> that it confounds language, and not mere|ly <HI>a&s;&s;ert</HI> it.</P>
<P>The Doctor, in the page la&s;t quoted, &s;ays,
<Q>The que&s;tion is, whether every act of the will is a new effect produced by the Deity or by &s;ome other extrin&s;ic cau&s;e.</Q>
I do not allow this to be the que&s;|tion. The Doctor a&s;&s;erts in general terms, that voli|tion is not properly an effect. The que&s;tion is entire|ly general, whether volition be an effect of any cau&s;e, <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> or <HI>intrin&s;ic.</HI> When this que&s;tion &s;hall have been &s;ettled, a &s;ub&s;equent one may ari&s;e, whether it be an effect of <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus I have con&s;idered Dr. We&s;t's arguments to prove, that volition is not an effect and has no cau&s;e. Whether they do really prove it, the reader will judge.</P>
<P>Dr. Price in his Corre&s;pondence with Prie&s;tly, p. 341, &s;ays,
<Q>An agent that does not put him&s;elf in mo|tion, is an agent that is always acted upon, and an agent that never acts.</Q>
On this I remark, that it is not true, that every agent, who does not put him|&s;elf in motion, is always acted upon, by an extrin&s;ic agent. The Deity did not at fir&s;t put him&s;elf in mo|tion, meaning by <HI>motion</HI> volition.&mdash;If he did, he was before without motion or volition. And Dr. Price would not pretend, that God exi&s;ted from eter|nity without any volition, and that when he came down within the limits of time, he put him&s;elf into volition, <HI>i. e.</HI> he created volition in his own mind. Or if by being <HI>acted upon,</HI> Dr. Price meant, the Deity's acting according to the mo&s;t wi&s;e and holy rea&s;ons, which his infinite un|der&s;tanding can &s;ugge&s;t; no doubt in this &s;en&s;e the Dei|ty him&s;elf is acted upon; and if this be incon&s;i&s;tent with agency, in&s;tead of but one, as Dr. Price &s;ays,
<PB N="131" REF="032073_0129_0FF110FBFB2622B8">
there is <HI>not one</HI> agent in the univer&s;e. God no more put him&s;elf in motion or volition at fir&s;t, than he put him&s;elf into exi&s;tence. Nor has he at any time put him&s;elf into any particular volition. This would im|ply a new thing and a change in God.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, that an agent that is acted upon cannot act, is as groundle&s;s, as to &s;ay that a body acted upon, cannot move; unle&s;s the main que&s;tion is begged, by &s;uppo&s;ing, that action means &s;elf-determinate action.</P>
<P>The advocates for &s;elf-determination are in like manner guilty of begging the que&s;tion, by u&s;ing <HI>active power</HI> to mean a &s;elf-determining or &s;elf-moving pow|er; a power which puts it&s;elf into exerci&s;e, without the agency or influence of any extrin&s;ic cau&s;e. We deny the exi&s;tence and po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a power: We hold, that it is as impo&s;&s;ible, as that an animal &s;hould beget it&s;elf, or take one &s;tep before the fir&s;t &s;tep. If this be meant by <HI>active power,</HI> we deny that any being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it; and our opponents ought to be a&s;hamed to beg it.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t holds, that volition is no effect and has no cau&s;e: He al&s;o holds, that volition is a modifica|tion of the mind. Indeed it is manife&s;t, that the mind willing, is the mind in a different mode or differently modified, from what it was, when not willing. Now is the event of this modification taking place in the mind, not an effect? And is it uncau&s;ed? Then not only does an event come to pa&s;s without cau&s;e, which Dr. We&s;t denies; but it happens by mere blind, &s;tu|pid, unde&s;igning chance.&mdash;It might as well be &s;aid, that the event of a canon ball moving is not an effect, as that the event of the mind willing is not an effect.</P>
<P>It is pleaded, that if volition be the effect of an <HI>ex|trin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e, it is wholly pa&s;&s;ive: Dr. We&s;t joins with others in this plea, p. 23. But if volition be the effect of an <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e, it is equally pa&s;&s;ive. For as Dr. We&s;t him&s;elf &s;ays very rightly, p. 23,
<Q>Every effect is wholly pa&s;&s;ive with regard to the cau&s;e which produces it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="032073_0130_0FF110FD8AA82258">Dr. We&s;t &s;ays, volition is "a property of a mind." P. 21, 22. Therefore when volition exi&s;ts in the mind, it is the &s;ubject of a property of which before it was de&s;titute. Now is not this an effect? Does not &s;ome efficient cau&s;e, either the mind it&s;elf or &s;ome other cau&s;e, endue it with that property, as really as if it were endued with any other property? Or as if a body were endued with a particular colour?</P>
<P>He further holds, page 6 and 7, that
<Q>virtue and vice are mere modes or attributes of a rational agent.</Q>
But virtue and vice are voluntary acts of the mind, or volitions. Therefore volitions are modes or attri|butes of a rational agent. But according to him the&s;e modes have no cau&s;e and are no effects. And if &s;ome modes be not effects, how &s;hall we know, that other modes or any modes are effects? If no modes be ef|fects, &s;ince we know nothing of &s;ub&s;tances but by their &s;en&s;ible modes and qualities; how &s;hall we know, that &s;ub&s;tances them&s;elves are effects?</P>
<P>Volitions are acts and events: And if &s;ome e|vents be uncau&s;ed, why may not all?</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t contradicts and gives up his doctrine, that volition has no cau&s;e, in all tho&s;e places, in which he allows, that volition is not without motive: As when he grants, "that the mind acts upon mo|tives" &mdash;
<Q>that when the mind acts or choo&s;es, it always has &s;ome end, de&s;ign or rea&s;on, which is the occa&s;ion of its acting or choo&s;ing</Q>
&mdash; that
<Q>motives are the previous circum&s;tances which are nece&s;&s;ary for action, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q>
Motives then are the rea&s;ons, the occa&s;ions, the nece&s;&s;ary previous cir|cum&s;tances or antecedents of volition. And what are the&s;e but <HI>&s;econd cau&s;es?</HI> Cau&s;es in the &s;en&s;e, in which Pre&s;ident Edwards explains him&s;elf to u&s;e the word <HI>cau&s;e</HI> with relation to this very &s;ubject, p. 41, 42.&mdash; We &s;ay, that fire is the cau&s;e of the &s;en&s;ation of heat; that rain and &s;un-&s;hine are the cau&s;es of vegetation, &amp;c. Yet they are no more than the &s;tated antece|dents. In the &s;ame &s;en&s;e motives, according to Dr.
<PB N="133" REF="032073_0131_0FF111128B3D5D78">
We&s;t, are cau&s;es of volitions. Be&s;ides, all &s;econd cau&s;es are the effects of the fir&s;t cau&s;e. Therefore ultimately volitions are effects of the Great Fir&s;t Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>If volition be no effect, it is not the effect of the mind in which it exi&s;ts. That mind has no control over it: It comes to pa&s;s without its wi&s;h or con&s;ent, as fully as if it were the effect of &s;ome extrin&s;ic cau&s;e. How then is the mind any more, or in any more de|&s;irable &s;en&s;e, free, than if volition were produced by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e? Which would a wi&s;e man choo&s;e? to have all volitions take place by pure accident, by blind chance and fate? or to have them ordered by a wi&s;e and good cau&s;e, in the application of proper motives? And are we agents in the former of the&s;e ca&s;es, more than in the latter? On this hypothe&s;is voli|tions are his, in who&s;e mind they exi&s;t, in this &s;en&s;e only, that he is the &s;ubject of them. And this is true on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that they are cau&s;ed by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e. And how on this plan, are we more accountable for our volitions and actions, than on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that they are produced in us by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e?</P>
<P>If volition be no effect and have no cau&s;e, it pro|ceeds from no power or faculty in human nature as its cau&s;e; not from the power of will, nor even from any <HI>&s;elf-determining power,</HI> whether it con&s;i&s;t in the will or in any other part of human nature. What then is the advantage of the &s;elf-determining power &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly advocated? It cannot produce one voli|tion nor one free act. How then does liberty con&s;i&s;t in it? or depend on it? Or how does it contribute any aid toward liberty? And what becomes of the boa&s;ted independence and &s;overeignty of the will?</P>
<P>That a volition is produced in me by &s;ome extrin|&s;ic cau&s;e, is not at all oppo&s;ed to liberty, unle&s;s by <HI>liberty</HI> be intended <HI>contingence</HI> or an exemption from all cau&s;ality. If I could cau&s;e a volition in my&s;elf, it would be as nece&s;&s;ary, as if it were produced by &s;ome other cau&s;e. Dr. We&s;t rightly ob&s;erves, that
<Q>every effect is wholly pa&s;&s;ive with regard to the cau&s;e,
<PB N="134" REF="032073_0132_0FF1112F87A07BF0">
which produces it.</Q>
As the volition then produced by my&s;elf is wholly pa&s;&s;ive, it could not be more pa&s;|&s;ive, if it were produced by &s;ome extrin&s;ic cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t, in p. 25, &s;ays,
<Q>Our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that we are &s;elf-active, &s;ugge&s;ts to us the ideas of cau&s;e and effect, of dependence and independence: <HI>i. e.</HI></Q>
Our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that we are the bare &s;ubjects of vo|litions, which are no effects at all, whether of our&s;elves or of any other cau&s;e, and therefore are not dependent on any cau&s;e, &s;ugge&s;ts to us the ideas of cau&s;e and ef|fect, dependence and independence. Whether this be rational, let the reader judge.</P>
<P>In p. 26, Dr. We&s;t explains him&s;elf to mean by <HI>vo|lition,</HI>
<Q>the <HI>relation</HI> of energy exerted by a cau&s;e in producing an effect;</Q>
and &s;ays,
<Q>It cannot be con|&s;idered as being an effect of any cau&s;e whatever, or as having any proper exi&s;tence of its own.</Q>
In &s;up|port of this idea he quotes Pre&s;ident Edwards, where he &s;ays, that action and pa&s;&s;ion are &s;ometimes u&s;ed to &s;ignify the mere relations of activene&s;s of &s;omething on another, and of pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s or of being acted up|on by another thing; and that in this ca&s;e they do not &s;ignify any po&s;itive effect or cau&s;e or any real ex|i&s;tences. Hence Dr. We&s;t infers, that according to Pre&s;ident Edwards, he cannot be charged with hold|ing that events take place without a cau&s;e.&mdash;On this it may be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P N="1">1. Pre&s;ident Edwards tells us, that whenever the word action is u&s;ed to &s;ignify a <HI>mere relation,</HI> it does not &s;ignify <HI>an action</HI> or &s;ome motion or exerci&s;e of body or mind. But Dr. We&s;t generally u&s;es volition to &s;ignify <HI>an action</HI> or exerci&s;e of the mind: And yet in the pa&s;&s;age now under con&s;ideration, he gives an explanation of volition, in which he &s;ays it &s;ignifies "the <HI>relation</HI> of the energy of a cau&s;e," and therefore not the energy it&s;elf, the exerci&s;e, exertion or act of that cau&s;e. Pre&s;ident Edwards did not &s;uppo&s;e, that the word <HI>action</HI> generally and properly &s;ignifies a mere relation; but that it generally and properly &s;ignifies a
<PB N="135" REF="032073_0133_0FF111008EED1F08">
po&s;itive exi&s;tence,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will be remembered, that logicians and metaphy&s;icians divide beings in|to &s;ub&s;tance and mode, and con&s;ider modes as having as real and po&s;itive an exi&s;tence, as &s;ub&s;tance.</NOTE> or an event which has as real an exi&s;tence, as any fact or event. As to the word <HI>vo|lition,</HI> Pre&s;ident Edwards never con&s;iders that as &s;igni|fying a mere relation. Whereas Dr. We&s;t con&s;iders this to be the proper meaning of volition.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the pa&s;&s;age, which Dr. We&s;t quotes from Pre&s;ident Edwards, the latter had good rea&s;on to &s;ay, that when the <HI>action</HI> is u&s;ed to expre&s;s not any exer|tion, fact or event, but the <HI>mere relation</HI> of activity with re&s;pect to &s;omething as the &s;ubject; it &s;ignifies no effect or cau&s;e and no real exi&s;tence. This may be illu&s;trated by &s;ome other relation; as &s;on&s;hip, the relation between father and &s;on. A father is a real exi&s;tence, and every created father is an effect. So is a &s;on. But <HI>&s;on&s;hip</HI> is no real exi&s;tence; nor is it a proper effect or cau&s;e, more than the relation between the three angles of a triangle and two right ones. Now volition is not &s;uch a mere relation: It is a real po&s;i|tive act, motion or exerci&s;e of a mind, and Dr. We&s;t abundantly grants this.</P>
<P N="3">3. If volition be a mere relation of energy, it is not "an exertion of an active principle,"
<Q>an act of the will, "an exerci&s;e of the mind," &amp;c. as Dr. We&s;t a&s;&s;erts it to be.</Q>
Be&s;ides, if it be a mere
<Q><HI>rela|tion</HI> of the energy exerted by a cau&s;e or mind, what is the energy, act, exerci&s;e or exertion of which volition is the relation?</Q>
Surely an act or exertion, and the relation of that act; a thing and the relations of that thing, are not one and the &s;ame. The &s;ame thing may have different and oppo&s;ite relations. The &s;ame man may &s;u&s;tain the oppo&s;ite relations of a father and a &s;on. And if &s;uch a man be the &s;ame thing with his relations, he is the &s;ame thing with his &s;on&s;hip, and the &s;ame thing with his fatherhood. Thus, as two things which agree with a common mea&s;ure, agree be|tween them&s;elves, it will follow, that &s;on&s;hip and fa|therhood are the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="136" REF="032073_0134_0FF1113297992340">4. By volition Dr. We&s;t means either an act of the mind, or not. If he do mean an act of the mind, vo|lition with him is not a mere relation, but a proper po&s;itive event or fact; and therefore mu&s;t be an ef|fect and have a cau&s;e; or an event takes place with|out a cau&s;e. If he do not by volition mean an act of the mind, it is &s;urely not a <HI>free</HI> act; and if we do not act freely in volition, we do not act freely at all, <HI>i. e.</HI> we are not free agents. It is generally granted, and to be &s;ure Dr. We&s;t's whole book implies, that all the moral liberty which we have is exerci&s;ed in volition. But if volition be a <HI>mere relation,</HI> and not an act and a free act; we have no liberty; and by holding, that volition is a mere relation and not an act, Dr. We&s;t gives up all that liberty for which he di&s;putes.</P>
<P>The Doctor, in his &s;econd part, p. 12, grants that
<Q>acts of the will, volition, choice and determination of the mind may with <HI>propriety</HI> be called effects, when they &s;ignify tho&s;e determinations or conclu&s;ions, which the mind makes in con&s;equence of its comparing two or more things together.</Q>
Therefore &s;ome acts of the will are effects. How is this con&s;i&s;tent with what the Doctor holds both in his former book and in this, that volition cannot be properly called an effect? Be&s;ides; what the Doctor here &s;ays, is applicable to all volitions, and therefore all volitions are according to his own account, effects. For all volitions are
<Q>de|terminations or conclu&s;ions, which the mind makes in con&s;equence of its comparing two or more things together.</Q>
If two or more things be expre&s;sly pro|po&s;ed, and one of them be cho&s;en, it is the very ca&s;e here &s;tated by Dr. We&s;t. Or if one thing only be expre&s;sly and po&s;itively propo&s;ed as the object of our choice, &s;till there is a real competition between this thing and the ab&s;ence or neglect of it; and the mind comes to a determination in con&s;equence of its com|paring the&s;e two together. Therefore according to Dr. We&s;t's own account every volition
<Q>may with propriety be called an effect;</Q>
and yet according to
<PB N="137" REF="032073_0135_0FF111023239B638">
the &s;ame Dr. We&s;t, "volition cannot be properly call|ed an effect." "How can the&s;e things be?"</P>
<P>But Dr. We&s;t endeavours to evade this con&s;equence, by &s;aying,
<Q>I have u&s;ed the term <HI>volition</HI> to &s;ignify <HI>the mind con&s;idered as acting.</HI> In this &s;en&s;e and in this only, I &s;ay volition is not <HI>an effect.</HI></Q>
But the mind con&s;idered as acting, acts in con&s;equence of comparing two or more things together, and &s;uch an act Dr. We&s;t allows to be an effect. Al&s;o he grants,
<Q>that the human mind and all its powers and facul|ties are effects; p. 13.</Q>
But will he &s;ay, that the human mind with all its powers and faculties <HI>dormant</HI> and <HI>inactive,</HI> is an effect, but the &s;ame mind with its powers and faculties <HI>acting,</HI> is not an effect? And does it cea&s;e to be an effect or a creature, as &s;oon as it begins to act?</P>
<P><Q>If volition be only the mind acting; and if the mind acting is properly a cau&s;e, then it is not prop|er to call it an effect.</Q>
Ibid, p. 13. But what or where is the impropriety of calling it an effect? In &s;uch a di&s;pute as this, to a&s;&s;ert &s;uch a novel propo&s;i|tion without proof or illu&s;tration, is unrea&s;onable. By the &s;ame rea&s;oning it may be proved, that any man who makes any thing is him&s;elf not an effect or crea|ture. Thus, If a carpenter at work be properly a cau&s;e of a &s;hip, then it is not proper to call him an ef|fect or creature; and if Dr. We&s;t writing be proper|ly the cau&s;e of &s;everal e&s;&s;ays on liberty and nece&s;&s;ity; then it is not proper to call him a creature.</P>
<P><Q>When volition is u&s;ed to &s;ignify the mind act|ing, in that view it is properly a cau&s;e and not an effect; ibid, p. 28.</Q>
What if it be properly a cau&s;e? This does not prevent its being properly an effect too, any more than the Doctor's being properly the cau&s;e of &s;everal e&s;&s;ays prevents his being, or proves that he is not, properly a creature of God.&mdash;
<Q>Cau&s;es as cau&s;es, are not effects; ibid, p. 13.</Q>
Then authors as authors, are not the creatures of God.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="032073_0136_0FF110E66BDE2DC8">The Dr. argues, ibid, p. 94, That an action can|not be the effect of the Deity, becau&s;e
<Q>an effect is mo&s;t certainly pa&s;&s;ive in coming into being &mdash; but this will imply <HI>pa&s;&s;ive action</HI> or <HI>inactive action,</HI> which is ab&s;urd.</Q>
I grant, that an effect is in this &s;en&s;e pa&s;&s;ive, that it is produced by the agency of the effi|cient cau&s;e; and in that &s;en&s;e a volition cau&s;ed by the Deity or other efficient cau&s;e is pa&s;&s;ive. If Dr. We&s;t mean by pa&s;&s;ive action, an action which in its production is cau&s;ed by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, I grant it; and however Dr. We&s;t pronounces it <HI>ab&s;urd,</HI> he knows, that it is as ea&s;y for another to pronounce it <HI>not ab&s;urd;</HI> and the one pronunciation is ju&s;t as good proof as the other. Volition is action, and if the Doctor will prove to the conviction of candid inquir|ers, that &s;uch an action cannot be the effect of a di|vine agency or other extrin&s;ic cau&s;e; he will do &s;omething more than affirm the contrary to be ab|&s;urd. As to the expre&s;&s;ion <HI>inactive action,</HI> if by this he mean, that the action is the effect of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, I grant it, and demand proof that the idea of &s;uch an action is ab&s;urd. If he mean an action, which is not voluntary; I know of no per&s;on who pleads for &s;uch an action.</P>
<P>What the Doctor &s;ays here, as well as almo&s;t his whole book, may be ea&s;ily retorted. Suppo&s;e voli|tion is not from an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, but from the &s;ub|ject as the cau&s;e; &s;till it is as really and fully pa&s;&s;ive with re&s;pect to its cau&s;e and in coming into exi&s;tence, as if it were the effect of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e. It would as much be the &s;ubject of the operation of this intrin&s;ic cau&s;e, in order to its exi&s;tence. Therefore in this ca&s;e too we have <HI>pa&s;&s;ive action</HI> and <HI>inactive action.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctor in p. 23, Part I, &s;ays,
<Q>How can he [man] be an agent, if volition be the effect of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e?</Q>

an agent, if it be the effect of an intrin&s;ic cau&s;e? The volition is &s;till as pa&s;&s;ive in this ca&s;e and equally pro|duced by the efficiency of its cau&s;e, as it is when pro|duced by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e. And how can man be an agent, if as the Doctor holds, volition be the effect of no cau&s;e, extrin&s;ic or intrin&s;ic? In that ca&s;e, it is merely ca&s;ual or accidental, like the motion of one of Epicurus's atoms in the infinite void.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI. Of Foreknowledge and the Certainty or Nece&s;&s;ity impli|ed in it.</HEAD>
<P>DR. We&s;t begins his third e&s;&s;ay thus;
<Q>We &s;hall endeavour to &s;how, in this e&s;&s;ay, that infalli|ble foreknowledge in the Deity does not prove, that events take place in con&s;equence of an antecedent or previous nece&s;&s;ity; p. 29.</Q>
Let foreknowledge prove or not prove what it will, unle&s;s events take place ab&s;olutely without a cau&s;e, they do take place in con&s;equence of an antecedent or previous nece&s;&s;i|ty. Unle&s;s they take place ab&s;olutely without a cau&s;e, they are effects; and every effect nece&s;&s;arily follows its cau&s;e. Dr. We&s;t grants, p. 23,
<Q>that every ef|fect is wholly pa&s;&s;ive with regard to the cau&s;e which produces it.</Q>
And as it is pa&s;&s;ive, it is brought into exi&s;tence by the cau&s;ing or nece&s;&s;itating influence of its cau&s;e. Its exi&s;tence therefore
<Q>takes place in con&s;equence of an antecedent or previous nece&s;&s;ity; and this is true of all events, which happen without cau&s;e.</Q>
But Dr. We&s;t denies, that any events take place without a cau&s;e. Therefore he mu&s;t concede, that all events
<Q>take place in con&s;equence of as antecedent nece&s;&s;ity.</Q></P>
<P>If to this it &s;hould be &s;aid, that though all events are effects, and are nece&s;&s;itated by their re&s;pective cau&s;es, and in that re&s;pect take place in con&s;equence of an antecedent nece&s;&s;ity: Yet as volitions are the effects of the mind, in which they exi&s;t, this cau&s;e does not <HI>produce</HI> them or exert its producing act, in con&s;equence of an antecedent nece&s;&s;ity; I an&s;wer, The mind, if it do efficiently cau&s;e volitions, cau&s;es them either in con&s;equence of an antecedent certainty, or without that certainty. If it cau&s;e them in con&s;equence of antecedent certainty, it cau&s;es them under the influ|ence
<PB N="141" REF="032073_0139_0FF11115892C4440">
of moral nece&s;&s;ity; for antecedent certainty of moral actions is all we mean by moral nece&s;&s;ity. If it cau&s;e them without that certainty, it cau&s;es them contingently and by mere chance or blind fate.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if the mind cau&s;e its own volitions, it ne|ce&s;&s;itates them into exi&s;tence, and therefore they come into exi&s;tence under the influence of antecedent ne|ce&s;&s;ity; and the cau&s;ing act is an event and there|fore mu&s;t have a cau&s;e, and <HI>this</HI> cau&s;e mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;itate <HI>this</HI> event into exi&s;tence; and &s;o it runs into an infinite &s;eries of acts cau&s;ing one another, every one of which comes into exi&s;tence in con&s;equence of an antecedent nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>That the infallible divine foreknowledge of any event does imply all that antecedent nece&s;&s;ity of the future exi&s;tence of that event, for which we contend, may appear thus:&mdash;The infallible or certain fore|knowledge of any event is a knowledge of the certainty or certain truth, that the event will come into exi&s;tence; and that certainty which is the object of this knowledge, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all the nece&s;&s;ity, for which we contend. This is what Pre&s;ident Edwards calls philo&s;ophical nece&s;&s;ity, which with regard to moral actions is moral nece&s;&s;ity; and it mu&s;t exi&s;t at the time the knowledge of it exi&s;ts, and in|deed in order to be the object of knowledge: And as the knowledge is by the &s;uppo&s;ition <HI>foreknowledge,</HI> there|fore it mu&s;t exi&s;t before the event foreknown, and therefore the certainty or nece&s;&s;ity of that event mu&s;t exi&s;t before the event it&s;elf; of cour&s;e it is <HI>antecedent</HI> nece&s;&s;ity. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e is to &s;uppo&s;e, that a certainty or certain truth may be &s;een and known be|fore it exi&s;ts, and that what is not, may be &s;een and known to be.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t argues, p. 32, that becau&s;e
<Q>the Deity is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an underived &s;elf-exi&s;ting knowledge, which is independent of any cau&s;e or medium what|ever, and his knowledge can extend to all futuri|ties, independent of the imperfect mode of inferring conclu&s;ions from their premi&s;es; con&s;equently in|fallible
<PB N="142" REF="032073_0140_0FF110B862E08720">
pre&s;cience in the Deity cannot imply any antecedent nece&s;&s;ity of the event foreknown.</Q>
By antecedent nece&s;&s;ity we mean antecedent certainty or antecedent certain truth. Now does Dr. We&s;t mean, that &s;ince the Deity po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an underived and &s;elf-exi&s;tent knowledge, therefore he &s;ees and knows, that there is a certainty of the future exi&s;tence of an event, when there really is no &s;uch certainty? Or that God knows that to exi&s;t, which does not exi&s;t? He does mean this, if he mean any thing to the purpo&s;e. For if he mean, that God &s;ees a certainty which exi&s;ts, it does exi&s;t in order to be &s;een; and therefore antece|dent certainty or moral nece&s;&s;ity is implied in the di|vine pre&s;cience. But let the knowledge of God be ever &s;o underived, &s;elf-exi&s;tent and independent, it will not enable him to di&s;cern that which is not, to &s;ee truth or certainty, before it exi&s;ts, or to &s;ee truth to be fal&s;ehood and fal&s;ehood to be truth.&mdash;If by <HI>inde|pendent</HI> knowledge he mean a knowledge which is not dependent on the truth and has not truth for its foun|dation and object; he mu&s;t &s;till mean, that God can know a propo&s;ition to be true which is not true.</P>
<P>It is manife&s;tly implied in what Dr. We&s;t &s;ays on this &s;ubject, that if divine foreknowledge were deriv|ed through any <HI>medium,</HI> or if it be founded on decrees, it would be utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with human liberty. But &s;ince it is, as he &s;uppo&s;es, immediate and not de|pendent on decrees, it is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with hu|man liberty.&mdash;That there will be a general rejection of antichri&s;t and antichri&s;tian errours, we know by the medium of divine prediction: And does the Doctor believe that this our knowledge is more incon&s;i&s;tent with the liberty of tho&s;e, who &s;hall reject antichri&s;t, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he ab&s;olute and underived knowledge of God? O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> than our own knowledge of the &s;ame fact, if it were intuitive and underived?</P>
<P>The Doctor adds, "If this definition of the divine knowledge," viz. that it is underived, &s;ell exi&s;tent and independent,
<Q>be ju&s;t; then it will follow that there
<PB N="143" REF="032073_0141_0FF1114649B14320">
is no previous or antecedent <HI>certainty in the things them&s;elves,</HI> upon which divine pre&s;cience is founded.</Q>
This manife&s;tly implies, that God foreknows things before they are future, and &s;ees a certainty before it is. "By certainty," &s;ays the Doctor,
<Q>in the things them&s;elves, previous to the divine knowledge, <HI>mu&s;t be meant</HI> &s;ome medium di&s;tinct from the things them|&s;elves, by which they render them&s;elves evident to the divine knowledge.</Q>
He here a&s;&s;erts, but brings nothing to prove what he a&s;&s;erts. And what &s;ignify &s;uch bare a&s;&s;ertions? Does the Doctor expect his readers will receive them as proofs? May they not ju&s;tly demand evidence, that this <HI>medium</HI> which he here mentions, mu&s;t be meant by certainty in things them&s;elves? By that certainty I mean no &s;uch thing: But po&s;itively I do mean what Pre&s;ident Edwards de|clares that he meant,
<Q>The firm and infallible con|nection between the &s;ubject and predicate of the propo&s;ition, which affirms them to be connected; or the <HI>real truth</HI> of the propo&s;ition.</Q>
For in&s;tance it is a real truth, that I am now writing, and the certain|ty or reality of this truth or fact, is the ground of the divine knowledge of it; and this certainty con&s;i&s;ts in the firm and indi&s;&s;oluble connection of the &s;ubject and predicate of the propo&s;ition which affirms, that I am writing. This certainty or truth of the thing is no "medium di&s;tinct from the thing" or fact
<Q>it&s;elf, by which it renders it&s;elf evident to the divine knowl|edge; but it is the real exi&s;tence of the very thing or fact.</Q>
&mdash;Again, it is to all Chri&s;tians a real and cer|tain futurity and truth, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t will judge in righteou&s;ne&s;s. But the truth and certainty of this fu|ture event is not a <HI>medium</HI> di&s;tinct from the futu|rity of the event it&s;elf, by which it renders it&s;elf ev|ident to the divine mind; but it is the real and infal|lible futurity of the event it&s;elf and con&s;i&s;ts in the firm and infallible connection between the &s;ubject and predicate of the propo&s;ition which affirms the futurity of the event. Now will Dr. We&s;t pretend, that there
<PB N="144" REF="032073_0142_0FF11148EA287330">
is no truth or no firm and infallible connection be|tween the &s;ubject and predicate of the propo&s;ition, that <HI>I am now writing,</HI> which is the foundation of the divine knowledge of that event? If this were &s;o, real truth and fact would not be the foundation, rule or object of the divine knowledge; but God might in|differently know truth to be fal&s;ehood and fal&s;ehood truth.</P>
<P>Or if by
<Q>the medium by which things render them&s;elves evident, the Doctor mean <HI>the truth and reality of things;</HI> I grant that what ever is known whether to God or creatures, is known by this medium; and this is true of the mo&s;t &s;elf-evident propo&s;itions and of the mo&s;t independent and underived knowl|edge.</Q>
But to call this <HI>a medium</HI> of knowledge is a perver&s;ion of language. Surely truth is not the me|dium by which it&s;elf is known.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t him&s;elf notwith&s;tanding his abundant la|bour
<Q>to &s;how, that infallible foreknowledge in the Deity does not prove, that events take place in con|&s;equence of an antecedent nece&s;&s;ity;</Q>
fully and fre|quently grants all that we maintain. Thus, p. 37.
<Q>That the Deity does perfectly di&s;cern all connec|tions between &s;ubjects and predicates &mdash; is readily granted.</Q>
Now this implies, that the &s;aid &s;ubjects and predicates are really and in them&s;elves con|nected, and in order of nature before that connection is di&s;cerned. This real and certain connection is the certainty or certain truth of things them&s;elves, of which we have been &s;peaking; and which with regard to moral events and actions is moral nece&s;&s;ity. P. 41.
<Q>The future volitions of moral agents are &s;o infalli|bly and indi&s;&s;olubly connected with the divine fore|knowledge, which has had exi&s;tence from a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> eterni|ty, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, that the Deity &s;hould be de|ceived; and therefore all the&s;e volitions will mo&s;t <HI>certainly</HI> take place.</Q>
P. 46.
<Q>There may be a <HI>certainly</HI> &mdash; that &s;uch a thing will take place, &s;peaking of an human action.</Q>
But certainty with re|gard
<PB N="145" REF="032073_0143_0FF11117535C5838">
to moral actions is moral nece&s;&s;ity, and if all vo|litions foreknown by God will <HI>certainly</HI> take place, they will take place by moral nece&s;&s;ity.&mdash;P. 52.
<Q>All things from eternity to eternity being pre&s;ent to the divine mind, <HI>he &s;ees all things as they are.</HI></Q>
Therefore if he &s;ee &s;ome events as certainly future, they are certainly future; for he &s;ees them as they are. And this certain futurity is the object of the divine knowledge, and in the order of nature is an|tecedent to it, as really as the exi&s;tence of this paper, on which I am writing, is in the order of nature antecedent to my &s;ight of it. But this antecedent certain futurity of any moral action, is antecedent moral nece&s;&s;ity. Therefore as all moral actions are <HI>foreknown</HI> by God in con&s;equence of an antecedent moral nece&s;&s;ity, much more do they <HI>come into exi&s;t|ence</HI> in con&s;equence of &s;uch an antecedent nece&s;&s;i|ty.&mdash;P. 53.
<Q>Deity would from all eternity have infallibly foreknown this propo&s;ition, <HI>as a certain truth,</HI> viz. the propo&s;ition concerning Peter and Judas denying and betraying their Lord.</Q>
It &s;eems then that whatever propo&s;ition concerning a future event is infallibly foreknown by God, is foreknown as a certain and infallible truth; or which is the &s;ame thing, it is known, as an infallible truth, that the event will come to pa&s;s; and therefore it is a certain and infallible truth antecedently in the order of nature to the knowledge of it: and therefore the event being a moral act, was morally nece&s;&s;ary antecedently to the foreknowledge, and much more antecedently to the event it&s;elf.&mdash;P. 52.
<Q>This nece&s;&s;ity being only a con&s;equence founded upon <HI>the certainty of the thing</HI> foreknown.</Q>
Thus notwith&s;tanding all Dr. We&s;t's clamour again&s;t Pre&s;ident Edwards, becau&s;e he had &s;poken of a <HI>certainty in things them&s;elves,</HI> he him&s;elf here expre&s;sly holds the very &s;ame. And will Dr. We&s;t deny, that this "certainty of the thing foreknown" is the ground of the divine foreknowl|edge of that thing, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, that my pre&s;ent
<PB N="146" REF="032073_0144_0FF11104EFEB22B8">
exi&s;tence is the ground of the divine knowledge, that I exi&s;t? If this be not denied, it cannot be denied, that certainty or moral nece&s;&s;ity is in order of nature antecedent to the foreknowledge, and much more an|tecedent to the exi&s;tence, of a moral action.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t will not deny, that any future event foreknown by God, will certainly come to pa&s;s. Then there is a certainty, or it is an infallible truth, that every &s;uch event will come to pa&s;s, and this cer|tainty now exi&s;ts antecedently to the exi&s;tence of the event. But this certainty with regard to moral events, is moral nece&s;&s;ity. Therefore there is a nece&s;&s;ity of the exi&s;tence of all events divinely foreknown, and this nece&s;&s;ity is antecedent to the exi&s;tence of the events. Thus, mere foreknowledge is an infallible proof of antecedent nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P><Q>We frequently &s;ay, It is a pity &s;uch a per&s;on did &s;o; there was no occa&s;ion for it; he might ea&s;ily have omitted the doing of the thing in the time of it, if he would. Why may we not as well &s;ay, A man <HI>will certainly</HI> do a particular thing, though he will have power to forbear doing it? There could not be the lea&s;t appearance of ab&s;urdity or contra|diction in &s;peaking in this manner about a future action, any more than about a pa&s;t action, were it not for the great difficulty or &s;uppo&s;ed impo&s;&s;ibility of conceiving how a thing can be foreknown, un|le&s;s it be connected with &s;omething that now ex|i&s;ts; that is, a thing cannot be foreknown, unle&s;s there is a medium, which has a pre&s;ent exi&s;tence.</Q>
P. 30.&mdash;On this pa&s;&s;age I remark,</P>
<P N="1">1. Here again Dr. We&s;t holds that certainty in things, which he &s;o abundantly reprobates in Pre&s;i|dent Edwards. He &s;ays, "a man <HI>will certainly</HI> do a particular thing;" and he doubtle&s;s means, that it is a certain futurity, the event it&s;elf is certain, or it is a certain and infallible truth, that the man will do the thing; and not merely that this truth is known, whether by God or creature. Truth is truth wheth|er
<PB N="147" REF="032073_0145_0FF110BF72EB04D8">
known or not: And this infallible truth is the very certainty in the things them&s;elves, of which Pre&s;|ident Edwards &s;peaks.</P>
<P N="2">2. What does Dr. We&s;t mean, when he &s;ays,
<Q>He might ea&s;ily have omitted the doing of the thing, <HI>if he would?</HI></Q>
Suppo&s;e the thing done was an <HI>in|ternal</HI> act, a volition to go to a debauch: In what &s;en&s;e does Dr. We&s;t mean, that the man could have avoided this volition, <HI>if he would?</HI> Does he mean, that if he had not had the volition, he would not have had it? This is an undoubted truth, but does not di&s;prove the nece&s;&s;ity of it. If God had not always &s;poken the truth, he would not have &s;poken the truth. But it does not hence follow, that God does not al|ways nece&s;&s;arily &s;peak the truth, when he &s;peaks at all, or that he can lie. If there had been no God, there would indeed have been no God; but does it hence follow, that the divine exi&s;tence is not nece&s;|&s;ary?&mdash;To &s;ay, that if a man had cho&s;en not to go to a debauch, he would indeed have cho&s;en not to go to it, is too great trifling to be imputed to Dr. We&s;t. Yet to &s;ay, that the man could have avoided the <HI>external action</HI> of going to the debauch, if he would, would be equal trifling; for the que&s;tion be|fore us is concerning the liberty of the <HI>will</HI> or <HI>mind</HI> and not of the body.&mdash;On the whole, we have before us one of Dr. We&s;t's <HI>things hard to be under&s;tood,</HI> and we mu&s;t wait for an explanation.</P>
<P N="3">3. When we &s;ay concerning any pa&s;t action of a man,
<Q>There was no occa&s;ion for it; he might ea&s;i|ly have omitted the doing of the thing in the time of it, if he would; if we mean, that there was no antecedent certainty, that he would perform that ac|tion, we mean a fal&s;ehood.</Q>
That action was as much from eternity the object of the divine omni&s;cience, as any action which is now future; therefore the cer|tainty of its then future exi&s;tence preceded its actual exi&s;tence. And this certainty was as fixed, unalterable and indefea&s;ible, as the divine foreknowledge or the
<PB N="148" REF="032073_0146_0FF110DFF943B6B8">
divine decree. The foreknowledge and decree of God imply no other kind or degree of nece&s;&s;ity, than the afore&s;aid ab&s;olute certainty. A futurity that is ab&s;olutely certain is implied in the divine foreknowl|edge; and the addition of a decree cannot increa&s;e that certainty.</P>
<P N="4">4. When we &s;ay, A per&s;on might ea&s;ily have omit|ted a certain pa&s;t action, in the time of it, if he would; we commonly mean, that he was under no compul|&s;ion or coaction, or no <HI>natural</HI> nece&s;&s;ity; and that he had a <HI>natural power</HI> to omit the action. This un|doubtedly every man has with regard to every volun|tary action, and this however that action be foreknown or decreed by God. Though Judas betrayed his Ma&s;ter,
<Q>according to the determinate coun&s;el and foreknowledge of God; yet he was under no <HI>nat|ural</HI> nece&s;&s;ity to betray him, but had a full <HI>natural power</HI> to do otherwi&s;e.</Q>
Now Dr. We&s;t reconciles foreknowledge with liberty, on the ground that we have &s;till <HI>a phy&s;ical</HI> or natural power to do otherwi&s;e. On the &s;ame ground we may reconcile ab&s;olute de|crees with liberty.</P>
<P N="5">5. In the &s;ame &s;en&s;e
<Q>we may as well &s;ay, Such a man will <HI>certainly</HI> do a particular thing, though he will have power to forbear the doing of it.</Q>
He may doubtle&s;s have a <HI>natural</HI> power to forbear; &s;till this does not at all dimini&s;h the <HI>certain futurity</HI> of the action; and that whether the action be foreknown only, or foreknown and decreed. And a natural pow|er is all the power, which the man will have to for|bear the action. Any power oppo&s;ed to moral nece&s;&s;ity or the certain futurity of the action, would imply that it is uncertain, whether he will perform that action&punc; which is contrary to the &s;uppo&s;ition made by Dr. We&s;t, "that the man <HI>will certainly</HI> do the thing."</P>
<P N="6">6. As to
<Q>the great difficulty or &s;uppo&s;ed impo&s;&s;i|bility of conceiving, <HI>how</HI> a thing can be foreknown, un|le&s;s it be connected with &s;omething that now exi&s;ts; this is needle&s;sly brought in here.</Q>

argument we are under no nece&s;&s;ity of inquiring or &s;howing <HI>how</HI> God foreknows future events, but may, &s;o far as relates to the certain futurity of all events foreknown by God and the antecedency of that cer|tainty to the exi&s;tence of the events, allow, that God foreknows future events in the independent and un|derived manner, which Dr. We&s;t maintains. This would equally imply a certainty antecedent to the ex|i&s;tence of the events foreknown, as a foreknowledge founded on a decree would imply it. Dr. We&s;t's ac|count of the divine foreknowledge implies, as I have &s;hown, all that certainty or nece&s;&s;ity, for which we plead. Be&s;ide what has been already &s;aid to &s;how this, I add, that Dr. We&s;t grants, that foreknowledge has no cau&s;al influence to bring things into exi&s;tence, or to make their exi&s;tence more certain, than it would be without foreknowledge.
<Q>I &s;uppo&s;e it will be readily granted on all &s;ides, that even the divine foreknowledge it&s;elf has no influence or cau&s;al force, with regard to the thing foreknown, either to bring it into exi&s;tence or to hinder its happening; but that all things would take place ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner, if they were not foreknown, as they do now; p. 45.</Q>
Dr. We&s;t al&s;o grants, that all future events are foreknown by God, and that all things which are foreknown by him, will certainly and infal|libly come to pa&s;s. Now as this certainty is not cau&s;|ed by foreknowledge, it mu&s;t exi&s;t independently of it. And as God &s;ees all things as they are; therefore when he &s;ees them to be certainly future, they <HI>are</HI> certainly future; and this certain futurity, which is the object of the divine knowledge, exi&s;ted in the order of nature antecedently to the divine knowledge, and much more antecedently to the actual exi&s;tence of the events them&s;elves. Otherwi&s;e God would &s;ee events to be certainly future, while they are not cer|tainly future.</P>
<P>"The obvious rea&s;on," &s;ays Dr. We&s;t, p. 31,
<Q>why we cannot know things but only by intuition

or proof, is becau&s;e all our knowledge is entirely <HI>ab extra.</HI></Q>
And does the Doctor believe, that if part of our knowledge were not <HI>ab extra,</HI> we &s;hould know &s;ome things neither by intuition nor by proof? What|ever is known by intuition is &s;elf-evident; and what|ever is known by proof, is evident by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;omething el&s;e. And whatever is known at all, is ei|ther evident by it&s;elf immediately, or is evident by &s;omething el&s;e mediately. Therefore Dr. We&s;t, in &s;uppo&s;ing, that if our knowledge were not all <HI>ab extra,</HI> we &s;hould know &s;ome things neither by intuition nor by proof, &s;uppo&s;es that &s;ome things would be evident to us, neither immediately nor mediately, neither by them&s;elves nor by any thing el&s;e: And what kind of a &s;ource of knowledge we &s;hould then have, I leave the Doctor to explain.</P>
<P><Q>If previous certainty in things them&s;elves means nothing di&s;tinct from the things them&s;elves, then all that can be meant by this previous certainty in things them&s;elves, upon which the divine knowledge is founded, is only this, that the Deity cannot know that things will exi&s;t, which he knows never will ex|i&s;t. And therefore to &s;ay, that there is a previous certainty in things them&s;elves, upon which the di|vine knowledge is founded, is only &s;aying in other words, that the divine knowledge is founded on the divine knowledge; p. 34.</Q>
By certainty in things them&s;elves I have already explained my&s;elf to mean the <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>reality</HI> of things them&s;elves, or the truth of the propo&s;ition which a&s;&s;erts their exi&s;tence or re|lation: And <HI>previous</HI> certainty of things them&s;elves means nothing different from the truth of the propo&s;i|tion, which a&s;&s;erts their future exi&s;tence, or its being a real truth, that tho&s;e things will exi&s;t. Now, wheth|er to &s;ay, that the divine foreknowledge of an event, is founded on the truth, that the event will come into exi&s;tence, be the &s;ame as to &s;ay,
<Q>that the divine fore|knowledge is founded on the divine foreknowledge, I am willing any candid per&s;on &s;hould judge.</Q></P>

<Q>That knowledge in the Deity mu&s;t mean the &s;ame thing with certainty.</Q>
No doubt knowledge in the Deity is the &s;ame thing with <HI>&s;ubjective</HI> certainty of certain knowledge; but it is not the &s;ame with <HI>objective</HI> certainty, or the truth which is the object of the divine knowledge.</P>
<P>The Doctor grants, p. 41,
<Q>That the future vo|litions of moral agents are &s;o infallibly and indi&s;&s;o|lubly connected with the divine foreknowledge, which has had exi&s;tence from all eternity, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, that the Deity &s;hould be deceived; and therefore the&s;e volitions will mo&s;t <HI>certainly</HI> take place. For by <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> here he [Pre&s;ident Ed|wards] can &mdash; mean nothing di&s;tinct from <HI>in|fallible certainty.</HI> But how does their being nece&s;&s;a|ry in this &s;en&s;e, <HI>i. e. infallibly certain,</HI> prove that the volitions of moral agents are effects produced by an <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e.</Q>
&mdash;Undoubtedly by nece&s;&s;ity in this ca&s;e Pre&s;ident Edwards means nothing di&s;tinct from infallible certainty. This is the very thing which he abundantly declares him&s;elf to mean.
<Q>And as the divine foreknowledge,</Q>
by Dr. We&s;t's conce&s;|&s;ion, "has had exi&s;tence from eternity;" and as
<Q>the volitions of moral agents are indi&s;&s;olubly connected with that foreknowledge,</Q>
and
<Q>tho&s;e volitions will mo&s;t certainly take place; of cour&s;e there was an infallible eternal certainty, that all human volitions would come into exi&s;tence ju&s;t as they do exi&s;t, and Dr. We&s;t grants all that we hold on this head.</Q>
What then becomes of liberty <HI>to either &s;ide, to act or not act?</HI> For in&s;tance, it is now divinely foreknown, that <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> will ri&s;e and compa&s;s the camp of the &s;aints. Therefore when <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> &s;hall come into exi&s;tence, they will no more have a liberty <HI>to act or not act,</HI> as to this in&s;tance of their conduct, than they would have, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the &s;ame conduct were decreed.&mdash;It is true, there would be this difference in the ca&s;es, that the decree would <HI>cau&s;e</HI> the certain futurity of that conduct, but the
<PB N="152" REF="032073_0150_0FF110D698E421A0">
foreknowledge would not <HI>cau&s;e</HI> it: Nor is it of any importance as to liberty, by whom or by what this certain futurity is cau&s;ed, or whether it be without cau&s;e. If a pri&s;on when built, be no ob&s;truction to liberty, then the agency of the ma&s;on and carpenter who built it was nothing oppo&s;ed to liberty. So if <HI>certain futurity,</HI> when e&s;tabli&s;hed, be not incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty; then the divine decree, by which it is e&s;tabli&s;hed, is not incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that God fore&s;ees, that <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> will influence them&s;elves to the conduct ju&s;t now mentioned; be it &s;o; then it is now infallibly cer|tain, that <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> will influence them&s;elves to that conduct. Where then is their liberty to act or not act? It is not left loo&s;e and undetermined, whether they &s;hall influence them&s;elves to that conduct; but it is previou&s;ly certain, that they will influence them|&s;elves to it.</P>
<P>The Doctor in the la&s;t quotation, a&s;ks,
<Q>How does their being infallibly certain, prove that the volitions of moral agents are effects produced by an <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e?</Q>
&mdash;Suppo&s;e they are not ef|fects of an <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> cau&s;e, but are effected by the &s;ubject of tho&s;e volitions, if that were po&s;&s;ible; yet if it be previou&s;ly and from all eternity certain, that the &s;ub|ject will produce the&s;e volitions in him&s;elf; &s;till there is no <HI>liberty to either &s;ide, to act or not act;</HI> but he is lim|ited to produce in him&s;elf tho&s;e very definite voli|tions, which are divinely fore&s;een, and therefore he is confined <HI>to one &s;ide,</HI> is confined <HI>to act</HI> and that definitely.</P>
<P>Or &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e volitions are produced by no cau&s;e&punc; whatever, then God fore&s;ees that they are a|bout to happen ab&s;olutely without cau&s;e and by mere chance; &s;till there is in this ca&s;e no liberty to either &s;ide, but the volitions are without cau&s;e confined to one &s;ide only.</P>
<P>It is abundantly pleaded by Dr. We&s;t and others, that the circum&s;tance that the divine foreknowledge is not the efficient cau&s;e of human volitions, renders
<PB N="153" REF="032073_0151_0FF11169834FEE50">
that foreknowledge entirely con&s;i&s;tent with their idea of liberty, even as the divine knowledge of a volition in pre&s;ent exi&s;tence is con&s;i&s;tent with the liberty of that volition.&mdash;If by liberty in this ca&s;e they mean &s;elf-determination or the cau&s;ation of volition by the &s;ubject him&s;elf; I grant, that the mo&s;t ab&s;olute foreknowledge is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with this idea of liberty: And &s;o is an ab&s;olute decree as con&s;i&s;t|ent with it. If God were ab&s;olutely to decree, that a particular man &s;hall cau&s;e in him&s;elf a particu|lar volition, the man would accordingly cau&s;e that volition in him&s;elf, and therefore according to the definition of liberty now given, he would be free.&mdash; But if by liberty in this ca&s;e be meant, what the writ|ers to whom I am oppo&s;ed, call <HI>a liberty to either &s;ide,</HI> and <HI>a power to act or not act,</HI> as oppo&s;ed to moral ne|ce&s;&s;ity; the divine foreknowledge of a volition is ut|terly incon&s;i&s;tent with the liberty of that volition. For according to this definition, liberty implies, that the volition is not fixed or determined, and therefore it is uncertain what it will be, or whether it will be at all. But divine foreknowledge implies, that it is ab&s;olutely certain, that a volition foreknown will be, and what it will be, as Dr. We&s;t grants.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance, that foreknowledge does not ef|ficiently <HI>cau&s;e</HI> an event to be certainly future, is noth|ing to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. We are not now inquir|ing what <HI>cau&s;es</HI> an event to be certainly future, but whether it <HI>be</HI> certainly future. If it be certainly fu|ture it is nece&s;&s;ary, in the &s;en&s;e in which we u&s;e the word <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> let what will be the cau&s;e of that futuri|ty, or if the futurity be uncau&s;ed. Divine prophecy is not the cau&s;e of the futurity of the event foretold, yet no man will &s;ay, that it does not prove the cer|tain futurity of that event. But prophecy no more implies or proves the certain futurity of the event foretold, than the divine foreknowledge implies and proves the certain futurity of the event foreknown.&mdash; To &s;ay, that a divine decree is incon&s;i&s;tent with liber|ty,
<PB N="154" REF="032073_0152_0FF110D89D375308">
becau&s;e it <HI>makes</HI> the action certainly future, when the certain futurity it&s;elf is allowed to be con&s;i&s;tent with liberty, is very &s;trange! What if it does make it certainly future? That certain futurity, when made, is not incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty. So long as this is granted, to hold that the divine decree as making or producing that certain futurity is incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty, is as ab&s;urd as to grant that a free circulation of the fluids in the animal con&s;titution is con&s;i&s;tent with health&punc; and yet to hold, that exerci&s;e <HI>as produc|ing</HI> and merely becau&s;e it produces that free circula|tion, is incon&s;i&s;tent with health.</P>
<P>I grant, that divine foreknowledge is as con&s;i&s;tent with liberty, as the divine knowledge of a pre&s;ent volition is. If by liberty be meant the cau&s;ation of volition by the &s;ubject, God may undoubtedly as well fore&s;ee this, as &s;ee it pre&s;ent. But if by liberty be meant a liberty to either &s;ide, a liberty to act or not act, as oppo&s;ed to moral nece&s;&s;ity; &s;ince this im|plies, with regard to an act now in exi&s;tence, uncer|tainty whether the act does exi&s;t, and with regard to a future act, uncertainty in the nature of things and in the divine mind, whether it will exi&s;t; I &s;ay, no &s;uch uncertainty is or can be with regard either to an act &s;een by God to be now in exi&s;tence, or an act divinely fore&s;een. As therefore the divine knowledge of the pre&s;ent exi&s;tence of an act, is utterly incon&s;i&s;t|ent with this kind of liberty in that act; we need not and we do not pretend, that the divine foreknowledge of an act is more incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ame kind of liberty in the act foreknown.&mdash;There is this differ|ence however in the ca&s;es; knowledge of a pre&s;ent act does not imply, that the act was certain <HI>previ|ou&s;ly</HI> to its exi&s;tence. But the foreknowledge of an act does imply this. This difference ought carefully to be noticed, or we &s;hall run into great errour. If, when it is &s;aid, that foreknowledge no more proves a nece&s;&s;ity of the act foreknown, than the knowledge of an act at pre&s;ent exi&s;ting, proves the nece&s;&s;ity of
<PB N="155" REF="032073_0153_0FF110C2AC29FFF0">
this act, the meaning be, that foreknowledge no more proves, that the future act foreknown is certainly fu|ture <HI>previou&s;ly</HI> to the exi&s;tence of it, than the knowl|edge of a pre&s;ent act proves, that this act was certain|ly future <HI>previou&s;ly</HI> to its exi&s;tence; the truth of this propo&s;ition is by no means allowed. Foreknowledge by the very term re&s;pects a future event; of cour&s;e the foreknowledge exi&s;ts before the event. And as it is granted on all hands, that foreknowledge implies a certainty of the event foreknown; it follows, that there is a certainty of the future exi&s;tence of every event fore|known, and this certainty is previous to the exi&s;tence of the event. But the knowledge of a pre&s;ent event may not exi&s;t before the event it&s;elf; if it does, it is then <HI>foreknowledge.</HI> And as it does not, &s;o far as it is the bare knowledge of a pre&s;ent event, exi&s;t before the event; it does not imply a <HI>previous</HI> certainty, that the event would come into exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>My &s;eeing a man perform an action does not prove, that it was certain beforehand, that he could perform it. But if a prophet under in&s;piration &s;ee, that a man will tomorrow perform a certain action, this does prove, that it is beforehand certain, that he will per|form it. And &s;urely the fore&s;ight of a prophet no more proves this, than the foreknowledge of God.&mdash; Suppo&s;e the act foreknown by God, is about to be &s;elf-originated, &s;till it is as nece&s;&s;ary or certain before|hand, as if it were not to be &s;elf-originated; becau&s;e the foreknowledge is from eternity and therefore pre|cedes the exi&s;tence of the act out of the divine mind. For though all things are always pre&s;ent <HI>in the divine mind;</HI> yet all things are not always in pre&s;ent exi&s;tence <HI>out of the divine mind,</HI> any more than all creatures exi&s;ted from eternity.&mdash;Be it &s;o, that in the divine foreknowl|edge all things are pre&s;ent; then all human volitions are from eternity as fixed and certain, as if they exi&s;ted from eternity not only in the divine mind, but out of the divine mind, and are as incapable of not exi&s;ting, as the divine mind is incapable of delu&s;ion or errour.</P>

<Q>Bare <HI>certainty,</HI> that an agent will do &s;uch a thing, does not imply in it, that he had not in him&s;elf a <HI>power</HI> to refrain from doing it; p. 45.</Q>
This de|pends on the meaning of the word <HI>power</HI> to refrain. If this mean <HI>natural</HI> power, as it has been explained, it is granted, that ever &s;o great certainty and even a divine ab&s;olute decree, that an agent &s;hall do &s;uch a thing, does not imply in it, that he has not in him&s;elf a power to refrain from doing it. But if by <HI>power</HI> to refrain be meant <HI>moral</HI> power, or a power oppo&s;ite to moral nece&s;&s;ity, which is the bare certainty of a moral action, it is ab&s;urd and &s;elf-contradictory to &s;ay, that the bare certainty that an agent will do &s;uch a thing, does not imply in it, that he has not a power to refrain from doing it. It is the very &s;ame ab&s;urd|ity and contradiction, as to &s;ay, that a bare certainty, that an agent will do &s;uch a particular thing, does not imply in it a certainty, that he will do it.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame page the Doctor tells us,
<Q>The only que&s;tion is, whether &s;uppo&s;ing it to be foreknown, that an agent will conduct in &s;uch a manner, at &s;uch a time, it will be any contradiction to affirm, that the &s;aid agent will have a power, at the &s;ame time, to act in a different manner.</Q>
If it be fore|known, that an agent will act in a particular manner, at a particular time; it will be granted, that there is a certainty, that he will act in that particular. But certainty of moral action is <HI>moral nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> and moral inability of the contrary. And to a&s;&s;ert, that an agent is under a moral inability to act in a different man|ner, and yet has a moral power to act in a different manner, is a direct contradiction.</P>
<P>The Doctor &s;ays, p. 29,
<Q>That infallible fore|knowledge in the Deity does not prove, that events take place in con&s;equence of an antecedent or pre|vious nece&s;&s;ity; that it only proves a <HI>logical</HI> nece&s;|&s;ity or a nece&s;&s;ity <HI>of con&s;equence; i. e.</HI> it being <HI>cer|tain,</HI> that a thing will take place, it follows, that to a&s;&s;ert that it will not take place, mu&s;t be fal&s;e and
<PB N="157" REF="032073_0155_0FF1116B783D7218">
cannot be true.</Q>
&mdash;As the Doctor makes much of this, which he calls a <HI>logical</HI> nece&s;&s;ity, or a nece&s;&s;i|ty <HI>of con&s;equence,</HI> let us examine it.</P>
<P>The foreknowledge of God is here &s;aid to prove a logical nece&s;&s;ity only, or a nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;equence; which is &s;aid to be this, that
<Q>it being certain, that a thing will take place, it follows, that to a&s;&s;ert that it will not take place, mu&s;t be fal&s;e and cannot be true.</Q>
Here one thing is &s;aid to follow from an|other, by a logical nece&s;&s;ity or a nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;e|quence. Let us take an example: It is a certain truth that the dead will ri&s;e; and does it hence <HI>fol|low,</HI> that it is a fal&s;ehood, that the dead will not ri&s;e? No, the latter is no more a con&s;equence from the former, than the former is a con&s;equence from the latter; or than that twice two are not unequal to four, is a con&s;equence from this propo&s;ition, that twice two are equal to four; or than from its being true, that a thing <HI>is,</HI> it follows as a con&s;equence that it is not true, that it <HI>is not.</HI> The one is no con&s;equence from the other, but is preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing expre&s;&s;ed in dif|ferent words, which convey the very &s;ame idea. You might as well &s;ay, that if a man be <HI>kind,</HI> it follows as a con&s;equence, that he is <HI>benevolent</HI>; or that if a man be <HI>bu&s;y,</HI> it follows as a con&s;equence, that he is employed in <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> Thus we may argue and draw con&s;equences all day long, yet make no more progre&s;s, than the &s;oldier who marches without gaining ground.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t &s;ays, p. 32,
<Q>No nece&s;&s;ity is implied in divine pre&s;cience, except merely a logical one; but this &mdash; is in the nature of things <HI>&s;ub&s;equent</HI> to the infallible foreknowledge of the exi&s;tence of the thing foreknown.</Q>
But does Dr. We&s;t mean, that in foreknowledge God fore&s;ees an event as uncertain, and that in con&s;equence of this fore&s;ight the event becomes certain? Surely the Doctor did not well con&s;ider the &s;ubject, if this be his meaning. To fore|know is certainly to fore&s;ee: And certainly to fore|&s;ee, is to &s;ee a future event as certainly about to be.
<PB N="158" REF="032073_0156_0FF110C44909D3D8">
This certainty of its futurity is &s;uppo&s;ed and implied in foreknowledge, and is not the <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of it. Dr. We&s;t &s;ays,
<Q>It will be readily granted on all &s;ides, that even the divine foreknowledge it&s;elf has no in|fluence nor cau&s;al force, with regard to the thing foreknown, either to bring it into exi&s;tence, or to hinder its happening.</Q>
Therefore it has no influ|ence to make its exi&s;tence certain or nece&s;&s;ary; how then is the nece&s;&s;ity <HI>&s;ub&s;equent</HI> to foreknowledge? The certainty of its exi&s;tence is <HI>antecedent</HI> in the order of nature to the foreknowledge, and is the ground or the object of it. This al&s;o is abundantly implied in va|rious pa&s;&s;ages of Dr. We&s;t's book, as has been &s;hown above. In p. 53, the Doctor &s;peaks of his logical nece&s;&s;ity as
<Q>only a <HI>con&s;equence founded</HI> upon the certainty of the thing foreknown.</Q>
But this cer|tainty of moral actions is the very moral nece&s;&s;ity, for which we plead. If the Doctor mean this by his log|ical nece&s;&s;ity, it is pre&s;umed, that the reader &s;ees the ab&s;urdity of &s;aying, that this nece&s;&s;ity is <HI>con&s;equent</HI> on the divine foreknowledge; and al&s;o the ab&s;urdity of &s;aying that it is <HI>founded on</HI> the certainty of the thing foreknown. A thing is not con&s;equent on it&s;elf nor on that which is founded on it&s;elf, as foreknowledge is founded on the certainty of the thing foreknown. If the Doctor mean any thing el&s;e by his logical ne|ce&s;&s;ity, I wi&s;h to be informed how he means any thing to the purpo&s;e of oppo&s;ing that moral nece&s;&s;ity of hu|man actions, which Pre&s;ident Edwards had advanced, and by which he explained him&s;elf to mean the certain|ty of moral actions. A logical nece&s;&s;ity con&s;equent on that certainty is a different thing from the certainty it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But allowing, what Dr. We&s;t holds, That fore|knowledge proves a nece&s;&s;ity con&s;equential to fore|knowledge; this nece&s;&s;ity would be as incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty, as one that is antecedent to foreknowl|edge; becau&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity would exi&s;t antecedently to the actions of creatures, as it follows immediately from foreknowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="032073_0157_0FF110C5D1B3A978">The Doctor, in his Second Part, p. 92, &s;ays,
<Q>Mr. Edwards had rai&s;ed a &s;pectre, which he could not lay. With him nece&s;&s;ity was nece&s;&s;ity; and with him it was all one, whether the nece&s;&s;ity was previ|ous to the thing in que&s;tion, or a con&s;equence drawn from the &s;uppo&s;ition of its having taken place.</Q>
This is an injurious repre&s;entation. The nece&s;&s;ity for which Pre&s;ident Edwards pleads, is
<Q>previous to the thing in que&s;tion,</Q>

<Q>a con&s;equence drawn from the mere &s;uppo&s;ition of its having taken place.</Q>
The nece&s;&s;i|ty for which he pleads, is that which is implied in di|vine foreknowledge; and as this exi&s;ts before the event foreknown, &s;o the nece&s;&s;ity which is implied in it and proved by it, is al&s;o previous to that event, and does not follow or begin to exi&s;t in con&s;equence even of that foreknowledge, and much le&s;s in con&s;equence of the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the thing foreknown has taken place. The only thing, &s;o far as I know, which could give occa&s;ion for this repre&s;entation by Dr. We&s;t is, that Pre&s;ident Edwards calls this nece&s;&s;ity <HI>a nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;equence,</HI> and &s;ays, that a thing nece&s;&s;ary in its own nature, or one that has already come into exi&s;t|ence, being &s;uppo&s;ed, another thing nece&s;&s;arily con|nected with either of the former, and the nece&s;&s;ity of who&s;e exi&s;tence is in que&s;tion, certainly follows; <HI>i. e.</HI> the nece&s;&s;ity of this la&s;t thing certainly follows from the exi&s;tence or &s;uppo&s;ition of the exi&s;tence, of either of the former. For in&s;tance, when the divine decree or foreknowledge of an event is &s;uppo&s;ed, the exi&s;t|ence of the event decreed or foreknown will certain|ly follow. But the nece&s;&s;ity, which Dr. We&s;t inju|riou&s;ly imputes to Pre&s;ident Edwards, is not the ne|ce&s;&s;ary exi&s;tence of <HI>one thing,</HI> implied in the &s;uppo&s;ed exi&s;tence of <HI>another;</HI> but the nece&s;&s;ary exi&s;tence of <HI>one and the &s;ame thing,</HI> &s;o long as it is &s;uppo&s;ed to ex|i&s;t; and this nece&s;&s;ary exi&s;tence amounts to no more than the mere identical, trifling propo&s;ition, that <HI>what is, is.</HI> Of &s;uch trifling Pre&s;ident Edwards was inca|pable,
<PB N="160" REF="032073_0158_0FF1116D1988A6D0">
and the implicit imputation, that he has writ|ten an octavo volume in &s;upport of a propo&s;ition &s;o in&s;ignificant, ought either never to have been made, or to have been better &s;upported, than by mere a&s;|&s;ertion.</P>
<P>In the latter part of his third e&s;&s;ay, the Doctor has &s;pent a number of pages to &s;how, that a certainty that a man will perform particular actions does not imply that he is under a nece&s;&s;ity of performing them, or that he has no power to avoid them. But all this is labour lo&s;t, and is ea&s;ily an&s;wered by making the di&s;|tinction between natural and moral inability; or it all depends on the ambiguity of words and is mere logomachy.</P>
<P>Dr. Clarke endeavours to evade the argument for moral nece&s;&s;ity drawn from the divine foreknowledge, by &s;aying, that foreknowledge no more implies nece&s;|&s;ity, than the truth of a propo&s;ition a&s;&s;erting &s;ome fu|ture event implies nece&s;&s;ity. This may be granted. If a propo&s;ition a&s;&s;erting &s;ome future event, be a re|al and ab&s;olute truth, there is an ab&s;olute certainty of the event; &s;uch ab&s;olute certainty is all that is impli|ed in the divine foreknowledge; and all the moral nece&s;&s;ity for which we plead. And though this cer|tainty is con&s;i&s;tent with a phy&s;ical or natural ability to do otherwi&s;e, it is not con&s;i&s;tent with the contingence or uncertainty of the event. So that there is no lib|erty of contingence in the ca&s;e, no liberty to either &s;ide, to act or not act, no liberty incon&s;i&s;tent with previous certainty of moral action, which is moral nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;es the doctrine, that the divine decrees are the foundation of God's foreknowl|edge. As I have already ob&s;erved, this que&s;tion &s;eems to be foreign from the di&s;pute concerning lib|erty; therefore I do not wi&s;h to bring it in here; otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have no objection to entering on the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of it. But &s;uppo&s;e the contrary were true, that foreknowledge is the foundation of decrees;
<PB N="161" REF="032073_0159_0FF1116F600CC1F8">
I pre&s;ume it would be granted, that decrees immedi|ately follow foreknowledge. Therefore all events are decreed before they come to pa&s;s. And as de|crees e&s;tabli&s;h, or imply an e&s;tabli&s;hment of the e|vents decreed, and this antecedently to their exi&s;tence; therefore on this plan there is an ab&s;olute certainty of all events and moral actions, and that antecedent|ly to the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e actions; becau&s;e they are all ab&s;olutely decreed by God immediately on his fore|knowledge of them and before they come into exi&s;t|ence.</P>
<P><Q>If this does not imply, that foreknowledge is not an e&s;&s;ential, attribute, I am under a great mi&s;take; p. 35.</Q>
Be it &s;o, that Dr. We&s;t is under a great mi&s;take; what follows? Is it impo&s;&s;ible, that he &s;hould be un|der a great mi&s;take? If foreknowledge be an e&s;&s;en|tial attribute, it doubtle&s;s exi&s;ts antecedently to hu|man actions, and therefore implies a certainty of them antecedent to their exi&s;tence. The truth is, that the foreknowledge of any particular event is no more an e&s;&s;ential attribute of God, than the knowledge of any pre&s;ent or pa&s;t event. Knowledge in general is an e&s;&s;ential attribute; but any par|ticular perception of the divine mind is no more an e&s;&s;ential attribute, than any particular act of the di|vine will, or any one decree of God. Will in gener|al is an e&s;&s;ential attribute; but Dr. We&s;t will not pre|tend, that every act of the divine will is an e&s;&s;ential attribute. Or if it be, doubtle&s;s every in&s;tance of foreknowledge is an e&s;&s;ential attribute. By the &s;ame argument by which Dr. We&s;t proves, that according to our ideas of decrees and foreknowledge, knowledge is not an e&s;&s;ential attribute; it may be proved, that according to Dr. We&s;t's ideas of tho&s;e &s;ubjects, will is not an e&s;&s;ential attribute of God. The Doctor, p. 36, tells us, "That the divine determinations are the Dei|ty decreeing and willing;" <HI>i. e.</HI> they are the will of God. But according to him the divine determina|tions or decrees are founded on foreknowledge. There|fore
<PB N="162" REF="032073_0160_0FF111725AE6AC48">
the divine will is founded on God's foreknowl|edge and is not an e&s;&s;ential attribute of God, but is &s;elf-created, or a creature of the divine under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The advocates for liberty to act or not act,
<Q>pre|tend not to be able to &s;olve the difficulty ari&s;ing from divine pre&s;cience.</Q>
This is an hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion. Yet with this acknowledged in&s;uperable difficulty attending this favourite doctrine, they are determined to adhere to it. This confe&s;&s;ion Dr. Price in particular makes in the following words;
<Q>The foreknowledge of a contingent event carrying the appearance of a contra|diction, is indeed a difficulty; and I do not pretend to be capable of removing it.</Q>
Corre&s;pondence with Prie&s;tley, p. 175.&mdash;If this be a &s;ufficient apology for holding a doctrine, which cannot be reconciled with an acknowledged truth, it will be ea&s;y to apologize for holding any doctrine whatever; <HI>e. g.</HI> the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. It is only nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, "That a body &s;hould be turned into fle&s;h, and yet retain all the &s;en&s;ible qualities of bread, as it carries the ap|pearance of a contradiction, is indeed a difficulty; and we do not pretend to be capable of removing it.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t holds, p. 53, that what is foreknown by God, is <HI>eternal truth;</HI> yet, p. 33, he holds, that
<Q>there is no antecedent certainty in things them&s;elves, on which divine pre&s;cience is founded: <HI>i. e.</HI></Q>
God knows a propo&s;ition to be a certain truth, before it is a certain truth, and after his knowledge of it, it becomes a certain and eternal truth; yet the divine knowledge has no cau&s;al influence to make it a truth.&mdash;He &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;es the idea, that human moral actions are certainly future antecedently to the divine fore|knowledge of them; at the &s;ame time, he grants, that they are not <HI>made</HI> certainly future by the divine fore|knowledge; and yet holds, that as foreknown by God, they are <HI>eternal truths.</HI> If they be eternal truths, doubtle&s;s the propo&s;itions which a&s;&s;ert them, were certainly true from eternity, and therefore in the di|vine foreknowledge of them God perceived that eter|nal
<PB N="163" REF="032073_0161_0FF111749FC28DE0">
truth and certainty, and that certainty was the ob|ject and &s;o the ground of the divine foreknowledge, and therefore there was
<Q>an antecedent certainty in things them&s;elves, on which the divine pre&s;cience is founded.</Q>
&mdash;Be&s;ides, as the Doctor grants that foreknowledge has no influence to cau&s;e that certain|ty, I a&s;k, By what is it cau&s;ed? Is it cau&s;ed by noth|ing? According to the Doctor the certain futurity of the things foreknown by God, does not exi&s;t antece|dently to foreknowledge, and is not cau&s;ed by it; yet it exi&s;ts from eternity; and it is that very eternal truth which there is in all things foreknown by God.</P>
<P>In page 45, he grants,
<Q>that all things would take place ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner, if they were not fore|known, as they do now.</Q>
Then all things and all e|vents are fixed and e&s;tabli&s;hed independently of fore|knowledge and antecedently to it, and were indepen|dently of foreknowledge certainly about to be. With what con&s;i&s;tency then does Dr. We&s;t deny a certainty in things them&s;elves antecedent to foreknowledge. And on what ground can he oppo&s;e the doctrine of di|vine decrees, which repre&s;ents tho&s;e decrees as antece|dent in the order of nature to foreknowledge?</P>
<P>If God from all eternity knew events to be future, they were future, and future in the order of nature before foreknowledge, and were future by the divine agency or by the agency of &s;ome other cau&s;e, or of no cau&s;e at all. If they were future by the agency of God, that is all that the doctrine of ab&s;olute decrees im|plies. If they were future by the agency of any oth|er cau&s;e, this &s;uppo&s;es another eternal cau&s;e. If they were future by no cau&s;e, they may and will come in|to exi&s;tence by no cau&s;e; which is ab&s;urd. To im|agine, that they are from eternity future by the agen|cy of human free will, is to &s;uppo&s;e, that human free will either exi&s;ted from eternity, or could and did pro|duce effects eternal ages before it exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that there is properly no foreknowledge in God, that all his knowledge is pre&s;ent knowledge,
<PB N="164" REF="032073_0162_0FF11176376D21F8">
and that pa&s;t, pre&s;ent and future, are now all pre&s;ent in the divine mind.&mdash;Still God does not view all <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> things as pre&s;ent. The <HI>exi&s;tence</HI> of &s;ome things is pre&s;ent to God; only the po&s;&s;ibility of other things is pre&s;ent to him. Whence ari&s;es this difference? What gives &s;ome things a pre&s;ent exi&s;tence in the di|vine mind, when other things have only a po&s;&s;ible ex|i&s;tence in the &s;ame mind? This difference is an ef|fect; otherwi&s;e all real exi&s;tences and events are ne|ce&s;&s;ary exi&s;tences, or tho&s;e which are not nece&s;&s;ary, become future, and finally come into exi&s;tence, with a cau&s;e. The difference between po&s;&s;ible and future volitions cannot be the effect of the mind of the crea|ture; becau&s;e it exi&s;ted before that mind exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>By all things being pre&s;ent in the divine mind, is meant not that God now &s;ees them to be pre&s;ent to creatures and in their view; but that his view of all things, &s;o far as relates to him&s;elf, is the &s;ame as it will be, when they &s;hall have come into exi&s;tence in the view of creatures. He &s;ees them not to be in exi&s;t|ence as to us, but &s;ees their exi&s;tence to be as to us future. And this is all that we mean by foreknowledge. So that &s;aying, that all knowledge in God is pre&s;ent knowledge, does not &s;how, that there is no foreknowl|edge in him. A knowledge of things as future with re|&s;pect to creatures, is foreknowledge: And the whole ob|jection, that the divine knowledge is all pre&s;ent knowl|edge, is founded on the ambiguity of words, or of the phra&s;e, <HI>all things are pre&s;ent in the divine mind,</HI> or this, that, <HI>all the divine knowledge is pre&s;ent knowledge.</HI> If the meaning of that phra&s;e be, that God &s;ees now, that certain things will at &s;ome future time be in ex|i&s;tence in the view of creatures; this is granted on all hands; and what follows from it? Surely not that there is no certainty previous to the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e things in the view of creatures, that they will thus be in exi&s;tence; but, that there is &s;uch a certainty. Therefore in this &s;en&s;e of the phra&s;e it is not at all op|po&s;ed to, but implies the doctrine of previous certainty
<PB N="165" REF="032073_0163_0FF11177E186BF98">
and moral nece&s;&s;ity, which we maintain. If that phra&s;e mean, that God now &s;ees all events, which ever take place, to have a pre&s;ent exi&s;tence in the view of crea|tures; this is not true and will not be pretended by our opponents. Yet this is the only &s;en&s;e of the phra&s;e, which oppo&s;es the doctrine of previous certain|ty as argued from the divine foreknowledge. That all things are pre&s;ent in the divine mind, can mean no more, than that all things are now &s;een by God, and that there is no pa&s;t nor future with him. Still he views &s;ome things to be pa&s;t, and other things to be future, with re&s;pect to creatures: And his view of &s;ome things as future with re&s;pect to creatures, is what we mean by the divine foreknowledge; not that he views things as future with re&s;pect to him&s;elf. If therefore God now &s;ees, that certain volitions will hereafter take place in the minds of <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Ma|gog,</HI> according to prophecy, they will <HI>certainly</HI> take place, and there is a moral nece&s;&s;ity of it, and a moral nece&s;&s;ity <HI>now exi&s;ting</HI> ages before tho&s;e volitions will have an exi&s;tence in the minds of tho&s;e men. The con&s;ideration, that all things are pre&s;ent with God, does, as before ob&s;erved, not at all prove, that there is not now a previous certainty or moral nece&s;&s;ity, that tho&s;e volitions will come into exi&s;tence; but ev|idently proves that there is &s;uch certainty, and that in two re&s;pects; (1.) A certainty previous in order of time to the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e volitions in the minds of <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog.</HI> (2.) A certainty previous in the order of nature to the divine foreknowledge it&s;elf, and which is the foundation of that foreknowledge.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t or all the objections brought again&s;t moral nece&s;&s;ity, may be brought with equal force again&s;t di|vine foreknowledge. For example;
<Q>If there be an ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity, that John go on in &s;in, and be finally damned, there is no po&s;&s;ibility that he be &s;aved. Then why &s;hould he or any other per&s;on u&s;e any endeavours toward his &s;alvation?</Q>
&mdash;If there be force in this objection, it is equally forcible again&s;t
<PB N="166" REF="032073_0164_0FF11150205ADA28">
divine foreknowledge: Thus, If God foreknow, that John will go on in &s;in and be finally damned, there is an ab&s;olute certainty or moral nece&s;&s;ity of it. There|fore there is no po&s;&s;ibility of John's &s;alvation; and why &s;hould he or any other per&s;on put forth any en|deavours toward it? This and all objections of the kind imply, that all moral events are left in a &s;tate of per|fect uncertainty, till they come to pa&s;s, that they come to pa&s;s by mere chance, and that they are not, and can|not po&s;&s;ibly be, the objects of foreknowledge.</P>
<P>It has been already ob&s;erved, that though divine foreknowledge is not the efficient cau&s;e of the certain futurity of any event; yet it implies, that the event is certainly future, and this certainty, let it be cau&s;ed by what it will, or though it be uncau&s;ed, is with re&s;pect to a moral event, moral nece&s;&s;ity, and equally con&s;i&s;t|ent or incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty, as if it were cau&s;ed by foreknowledge. I now ob&s;erve further, that this cer|tain futurity undoubtedly is cau&s;ed <HI>by &s;omething.</HI> It is equally ab&s;urd to imagine, that an event may become <HI>future</HI> without a cau&s;e, as that it may come <HI>into exi&s;t|ence</HI> without a cau&s;e. Certain futurity implies, that the actual exi&s;tence of the event is &s;ecured to take place in due time. And whatever is able thus to &s;e|cure the event, is able to bring it into exi&s;tence. If it may be &s;ecured without a cau&s;e, it may be brought into exi&s;tence without a cau&s;e. This certain futurity of all events from eternity is an effect, and cannot be the effect of any creature, becau&s;e no creature exi&s;ted from eternity. It mu&s;t therefore be the effect of the Creator, who alone exi&s;ted from eternity, and who alone there|fore could from eternity give futurity to any event.</P>
<P>Therefore however frightened Dr. We&s;t and other writers be at the idea, that moral actions &s;hould be the effect of a cau&s;e extrin&s;ic to the &s;ubject of tho&s;e actions, we &s;eem to be nece&s;&s;itated to give into this idea, from the con&s;ideration, that all moral actions of creatures were from eternity foreknown and therefore were certainly future. This eternal futurity mu&s;t be
<PB N="167" REF="032073_0165_0FF1117A2DE6D6D8">
an effect of a cau&s;e extrin&s;ic to all creatures. This extrin&s;ic cau&s;e &s;ecures their exi&s;tence, and in due time actually brings them into exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that God knows all things from eternity, as we know things pre&s;ently exi&s;ting before our eyes. Now the actual exi&s;tence of things out of our minds is the foundation of our knowledge in the ca&s;e. But it will not be &s;aid, that all things exi&s;ted from eternity out of the divine mind, and that this exi&s;tence of them is the foundation of the divine eternal knowl|edge of them or of their exi&s;tence in the divine mind. If they did eternally exi&s;t out of the divine mind, they were nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;tent in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in which God is; and con&s;equently none of our actions are cau&s;ed by our&s;elves or by our &s;elf-determining power: They are as uncau&s;ed, as nece&s;&s;ary and as eternal, as the divine exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Dr. Clarke in his remarks on Collins, p. 39, &s;ays, that
<Q>in the argument drawn again&s;t liberty from the divine pre&s;cience, or power of judging infallibly con|cerning free events, it mu&s;t be proved, that things otherwi&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed free, will thereby unavoidably become nece&s;&s;ary.</Q>
On this I remark, (1.) That if by the word <HI>free</HI> the Doctor mean any thing oppo|&s;ite to the mo&s;t ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity, he mu&s;t mean <HI>contingent, uncertain, not certainly future.</HI> But nothing is in this &s;en&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed, or allowed, to be free.&mdash;(2.) We do not pretend from the divine pre&s;cience to prove, that "thereby things unavoida|bly <HI>become</HI> nece&s;&s;ary," or certainly future. But we do pretend from pre&s;cience to prove, that all events <HI>were</HI> certainly future, in the order of nature, antece|dently to the pre&s;cience; and that they are certainly future in the order of time, antecedently to their ex|i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Dr. Clarke in his <HI>Being and Attributes,</HI> p. 95, &amp;c. grants, that all things are and were certain from eter|nity, and yet &s;uppo&s;es, p. 97, that an univer&s;al fatali|ty would be incon&s;i&s;tent with morality. But it &s;eems,
<PB N="168" REF="032073_0166_0FF110CF42F80280">
that according to the Doctor an univer&s;al and eternal certainty of all things is not incon&s;i&s;tent with morali|ty; and if by fatality he meant any thing different from certainty, he oppo&s;es what nobody holds.&mdash; Ibid, p. 98, the Doctor &s;ays,
<Q>mere certainty of event does not imply nece&s;&s;ity.</Q>
But mere cer|tainty of event doubtle&s;s implies it&s;elf, and that is all the nece&s;&s;ity, for which we plead. The Doctor's ar|gument to prove, that certainty does not imply nece&s;|&s;ity, is, that foreknowledge implies no more certainty, than would exi&s;t without it. At the &s;ame time he grants, that there is
<Q>the &s;ame certainty of event in every one of man's actions, as if they were never &s;o fatal and nece&s;&s;ary.</Q>
Now any other certainty or ne|ce&s;&s;ity than this we do not pretend to be implied in foreknowledge. And as the Doctor him&s;elf grants this nece&s;&s;ity to exi&s;t, whether there be or be not fore|knowledge; then in either ca&s;e all that nece&s;&s;ity, for which we plead, is granted to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t, in p. 20, 21, Part II, thinks Pre&s;ident Edwards incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, in denying, that the divine decrees are founded on foreknowledge, and yet holding, that
<Q>the perfection of his under&s;tanding is the foundation of his decrees.</Q>
The Doctor ar|gues, that
<Q>If foreknowledge in the Deity, is part of the perfection of the divine under&s;tanding. Then is it the foundation of his wi&s;e purpo&s;es and decrees; and &s;o his objection lies ju&s;t as &s;trong again&s;t him, as again&s;t us.</Q>
Doubtle&s;s the perfection of the di|vine under&s;tanding; <HI>i. .e</HI> God's perfect view of the fitne&s;s of certain things to certain u&s;es and ends, is the rea&s;on why he decrees and appoints tho&s;e things to tho&s;e u&s;es and ends. But this is very different from &s;uppo&s;ing that foreknowledge is the foundation of de|crees, and that God fir&s;t fore&s;ees certain events about to take place, and then decrees to permit them to take place. And the inconclu&s;ivene&s;s of Dr. We&s;t's argu|ment ju&s;t quoted, may appear thus; If after-knowledge, or a knowledge, that events have taken place, be a part
<PB N="169" REF="032073_0167_0FF11151EA34C388">
of the divine under&s;tanding; then it is the foundation of his wi&s;e purpo&s;es and decrees. But it will not be pre|tended, that the con&s;equent in this ca&s;e ju&s;tly follows from the antecedent. Yet it follows as ju&s;tly as in the argument of the Doctor. Not every perception which belongs to the divine under&s;tanding is the foundation of God's decrees univer&s;ally or generally: Be&s;ide the in&s;tance already mentioned, I might men|tion God's perfect knowledge of geometry, mechanics, &amp;c. The divine perfect knowledge of tho&s;e &s;ciences is not the foundation of all God's decrees: No more is God's foreknowledge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII. Objections con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is argued, that we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;elf-deter|mining power and a liberty to either &s;ide, be|cau&s;e we find, that we have a power to con&s;ider and examine an action propo&s;ed to us, and to <HI>&s;u&s;pend</HI> our determination upon it, till we &s;hall have duly con&s;id|ered it.&mdash;But as the determination to &s;u&s;pend and examine is a voluntary act, it no more appears to be without motive or without moral nece&s;&s;ity than any other voluntary act.&mdash;Su&s;pen&s;ion is either a vol|untary act or not. If it be a voluntary act, it no more appears to be without motive and moral nece&s;|&s;ity, than any other voluntary act. If it be not a volun|tary act, it is not a <HI>free</HI> act, nor is any liberty exerci&s;ed in it; and therefore it is nothing to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To argue, that we have a power of &s;elf-determina|tion, becau&s;e we have a power to &s;u&s;pend an action, is as groundle&s;s, as to argue, that we have a power of &s;elf-determination, becau&s;e we have a power to choo&s;e to act, or becau&s;e we have a power of will. Su&s;pen|&s;ion is a voluntary act or a volition, and the argument under con&s;ideration is this; A man has a volition, not at pre&s;ent to determine in a certain ca&s;e; therefore he has a power efficiently to cau&s;e volition in him|&s;elf. This argument is ju&s;t as conclu&s;ive as the fol|lowing; A man has a volition at pre&s;ent to determine in a certain ca&s;e; therefore he has a power efficiently to cau&s;e volition in him&s;elf: Or as this; A man has a a volition, therefore he has a power efficiently to cau&s;e volition in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But if &s;u&s;pen&s;ion be no voluntary act, but a total &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of all volition, it is, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till le&s;s a proof of &s;elf-determination. Self-determination is a vol|untary act, and &s;u&s;pen&s;ion is brought as an in&s;tance
<PB N="171" REF="032073_0169_0FF1115666AC5C30">
of &s;elf-determination. But how can that, which is no voluntary act be an in&s;tance of a voluntary act? This is as ab&s;urd as to argue &s;elf-determination from any intellectual perception, or from the perfect in&s;en&s;ibil|ity of a dead corp&s;e.&mdash;But this mode of arguing is familiar with Dr. We&s;t, who con&s;tantly argues a &s;elf-determining power, from a power to <HI>not act,</HI> a power to be perfectly torpid.</P>
<P N="2">2. Self-determination is argued from our own con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and experience. Dr. We&s;t &s;ays, page 26, that <Q>we experience in our&s;elves, that in willing and choo&s;ing we act independently of any extrin&s;ic cau&s;e.</Q>
Others hold, that we are <HI>con&s;cious</HI> of &s;elf-de|termination and an exemption from extrin&s;ic cau&s;al|ity.&mdash;When gentlemen &s;peak of experience and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, they ought to confine their ob&s;ervations to them&s;elves; as no man is con&s;cious of more than pa&s;&s;es in his own mind, and in &s;uch things a man can with certainty tell his own experience only. For my own part, I am not con&s;cious of either &s;elf-cau&s;a|tion of volition, or an exemption from extrin&s;ic cau&s;|ality; and to be &s;ure I am not con&s;cious, that my volitions take place without cau&s;e and by mere chance. I am con&s;cious of volitions of various kinds; but I never yet caught my&s;elf in the act of <HI>making a volition,</HI> if this mean any thing more than <HI>having</HI> a volition or being the &s;ubject of it. If any man be con&s;cious, that he makes his own volitions, he is doubtle&s;s con|&s;cious of two di&s;tinct acts in this, one <HI>the act made</HI> by him&s;elf, another <HI>the act making</HI> or by which he makes <HI>the act made.</HI> Now will any man profe&s;s to the world, that he is or ever has been con&s;cious of the&s;e di&s;tinct acts? If not, let him tell the world what he means by being the efficient cau&s;e of his own volitions. If he mean, that he has volitions, this is no more than the advocates for moral nece&s;&s;ity are con&s;cious of, and to grant that this is all that is meant, is to give up the argument. If it be meant, that he cau&s;es them by <HI>the mind it&s;elf</HI> or by &s;ome <HI>power</HI> of the mind and not

by any <HI>act</HI> of the mind or of tho&s;e powers; I appeal to the reader, whether this be, or can be, a matter of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. I take it to be univer&s;ally granted, that no man can be con&s;cious of more than the <HI>acts</HI> and perceptions of his own mind. The exi&s;tence of the mind and of its powers, is <HI>inferred</HI> from the acts, and we are not properly con&s;cious of them. Dr. Reid may be an authority with the gentlemen, with whom I am now concerned. "<HI>Power,</HI>" &s;ays he,
<Q>is not an object of any of our external &s;en&s;es, nor even an object of <HI>con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> That it is not &s;een, nor heard, nor touched, nor ta&s;ted, nor &s;mels, needs no proof. That we are not con&s;cious of it, in the proper &s;en&s;e of the word, will be no le&s;s evident, if we reflect, that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is that power of the mind, by which it has an immediate knowledge of its own <HI>operations.</HI> Power is not an operation of the mind, and therefore is <HI>no object of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Indeed every operation of the mind is the exertion of &s;ome power of the mind; but we are con&s;cious of the <HI>operation only,</HI> and the power lies behind the &s;cene: And though we may ju&s;tly <HI>infer</HI> the power from the operation, it mu&s;t be remembered, that <HI>inferring</HI> is not the province of <HI>con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> but of <HI>rea&s;on.</HI></Q>
<HI>E&s;&s;ays on Active Powers,</HI> p. 7.</P>
<P>If from our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of volitions, it follows, that we <HI>efficiently cau&s;e</HI> tho&s;e volitions, let a rea&s;on be given, why it will not equally follow from our con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of any perception, <HI>e. g.</HI> the &s;ound of thun|der, that we efficiently cau&s;e that too.</P>
<P>If we be the efficient cau&s;es of our own volitions, they are effects. But an effect is produced by a pre|vious exertion of the efficient cau&s;e, which act is as di&s;tinct from the effect, as the divine creating act was di&s;tinct from the world created. Every effect is pa&s;|&s;ive with regard to its cau&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ive in this re&s;pect, that the cau&s;al act of the efficient operates upon it: Therefore the volition is and mu&s;t be di&s;tinct from the act of the efficient by which it is cau&s;ed. If a man
<PB N="173" REF="032073_0171_0FF1117DD0836EA8">
be the efficient cau&s;e of his own volition and he be con&s;cious of it, he is con&s;cious of an act of his own mind previous to every volition cau&s;ed by him&s;elf, efficiently cau&s;ing that volition, and as this cau&s;ing act mu&s;t be a voluntary act, in order to be a free one, there mu&s;t be an infinite &s;eries of voluntary acts cau&s;|ing one another, or one act before the fir&s;t: And of this the man who is &s;ubject, mu&s;t have a con&s;cious experience, or el&s;e he cannot be con&s;cious of &s;elf-de|termination. Whether any man will profe&s;s to be con&s;cious of all this, we mu&s;t wait to &s;ee. It is to be pre&s;umed however, that no man will profe&s;s to have experienced an infinite &s;eries of acts, or one act before the fir&s;t act.</P>
<P>As to knowing by con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and experience, that our volitions are not the effect of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e; this I conceive is an ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility, unle&s;s we know by experience and are con&s;cious, that we our&s;elves efficiently cau&s;e them in the manner ju&s;t now de&s;cribed, viz. in an infinite &s;eries, or with one act before the fir&s;t. Unle&s;s we be con&s;cious, that we cau&s;e our own fir&s;t volition by a previous act, we can|not be con&s;cious, that we cau&s;e it at all. And if we be not con&s;cious, that we cau&s;e that, we cannot be con&s;cious but that it was cau&s;ed extrin&s;ically. If we do not experience that we cau&s;e our volitions by our own previous acts, we do not experience, that we cau&s;e them at all. All we experience is the volitions them&s;elves, and we have no more evidence, that they are not the effects of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, than from the experience of any of our ideas of &s;en&s;ation, we have evidence that tho&s;e ideas are not excited by an ex|trin&s;ic cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Let an in&s;tance be taken and I pre&s;ume no man will pretend, that he is con&s;cious, that he cau&s;es one volition by another: <HI>e. g.</HI> a volition to give to the poor. Will any man pretend, that he is con&s;cious, that he cau&s;es in him&s;elf a volition to give to the poor, by a previous volition; and that he in the fir&s;t place
<PB N="174" REF="032073_0172_0FF1117FCC52FFB0">
finds, by con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that he choo&s;es to have a vo|lition to give to the poor before he has it, and that by this previous choice he becomes willing to give to the poor? If no man will pretend this, but every man by the bare &s;tating of the ca&s;e &s;ees, that it implies the ab|&s;urdity that he is willing before he is willing, &s;urely it is high time to give up this argument from experi|ence and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that we <HI>perceive</HI> no extrin&s;ic influ|ence producing our volitions. Nor do we perceive any extrin&s;ic influence producing a great part of our thoughts and perceptions, which yet it will not be pre|tended, that we our&s;elves cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for a man to be con&s;cious of a negative, otherwi&s;e than as he is either not con&s;cious of it, or is con&s;cious of the oppo&s;ite po&s;itive. Therefore when it is &s;aid, that we are con&s;cious, that our volitions are not the effect of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, the meaning mu&s;t be ei|ther that we are not con&s;cious, that they are the effect of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, or that we are con&s;cious, that we do efficiently cau&s;e them our&s;elves. That we are not con&s;cious, that our volitions are the effect of an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, is no proof, that they are in fact not the effect of &s;uch a cau&s;e, becau&s;e if they were the effect of &s;uch a cau&s;e, &s;till we &s;hould not be con|&s;cious of it. If whether they be the effect of &s;uch a cau&s;e or not, we &s;hould not be con&s;cious, that they are the effect of &s;uch a cau&s;e, then the circum&s;tance that we are not con&s;cious, that they are the effect of &s;uch a cau&s;e, is no proof either way. Nor are we con&s;cious, that we do efficiently cau&s;e our own voli|tions, as it is pre&s;umed appears by what has been al|ready &s;aid in this and former chapters.</P>
<P>But if we were con&s;cious, that we do efficiently cau&s;e our own volitions, this would be no argument again&s;t the ab&s;olute previous certainty or moral ne|ce&s;&s;ity of all our volitions. Such efficiency may have been from eternity the object of the divine ab|&s;olute foreknowledge or decree. So that to a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="175" REF="032073_0173_0FF11158D3531908">
of liberty as oppo&s;ed to moral nece&s;&s;ity, it is requi&s;ite, that we be con&s;cious not only, that we effi|ciently cau&s;e our own volitions, but that we cau&s;e them, with the circum&s;tance, that it was previou&s;ly uncer|tain, whether we &s;hould cau&s;e them or not. But of this circum&s;tance it is impo&s;&s;ible, that we &s;hould be con&s;cious; it is no act or perception of the mind, and therefore cannot be an object of con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Archbi&s;hop King &s;peaks of a man's being
<Q>con|&s;cious, that it was in his power, to have done other|wi&s;e than he has done.</Q>
If this mean any thing op|po&s;ite to moral nece&s;&s;ity, it mu&s;t mean, that a man is con&s;cious, that it was not previou&s;ly certain, that he would do as he has done. But of this no man can be con&s;cious, for the rea&s;on already given.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is further argued, that we act as if we were under no nece&s;&s;ity, but at perfect liberty; and that therefore the doctrine of moral nece&s;&s;ity is contra|dicted by all our conduct, and the maxims of it.&mdash; To this I an&s;wer, that our conduct does by no means &s;how, that we are not influenced by motives, or that we act without motives, without de&s;ign, with|out bia&s;es, ta&s;tes&punc; appetites or any &s;uch principles, and in perfect indifference, in&s;en&s;ibility and &s;tupidity. On the other hand, the conduct of all mankind &s;hows, that they are actuated by motives, bia&s;es, various pa&s;|&s;ions and appetites, which have as &s;tated and regular an effect on their minds and conduct, as &s;econd cau&s;es have in the natural world. The conduct of men does by no means &s;how, that their conduct is previou&s;ly altogether uncertain and left to mere chance. It does indeed &s;how, that they are free agents in the proper &s;en&s;e; <HI>i. e.</HI> intelligent, voluntary agents, acting upon motives and various principles in human nature, natural and acquired; and therefore we u&s;e ar|guments and motives with one another to in|fluence each other's conduct. All this is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;cheme of moral nece&s;&s;ity for
<PB N="176" REF="032073_0174_0FF11182DA2BB500">
which I plead, and is implied in it: And all govern|ment civil and dome&s;tic is not only con&s;i&s;tent with that &s;cheme, but is built upon it; otherwi&s;e in vain would be all the motives of rewards and puni&s;hments exhibited as the means of government, and by which government is carried into effect.</P>
<P>If moral nece&s;&s;ity be incon&s;i&s;tent with the practice of mankind, &s;o is that previous certainty implied in the divine foreknowledge; for that, with re&s;pect to moral actions, is moral nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is objected, that on this plan all agency and action are de&s;troyed or precluded.&mdash;An&s;wer; If by agency and action be meant &s;elf-determinate or con|tingent agency and action, I grant that this &s;cheme does preclude them and means to preclude them. But it is not allowed, that &s;uch agency and action are nece&s;&s;ary to a rational, moral being, or are at all de|&s;irable or even po&s;&s;ible: And to take the&s;e for grant|ed, is to beg the main points in di&s;pute. Let it be &s;hown that &s;uch agency and action are nece&s;&s;ary, de&s;irable, or po&s;&s;ible, and &s;omething to the purpo&s;e will be done. But rational voluntary agency or action, ari&s;ing from motive and principle, and directed to &s;ome end, is not precluded, but &s;uppo&s;ed and e&s;tabli&s;hed by this &s;cheme.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that on the hypothe&s;is of a divine agen|cy in all things, there is <HI>but one agent</HI> in the univer&s;e. But the Deity is no &s;elf-determinate agent: He is no more the efficient cau&s;e of his own volitions than he is of his own exi&s;tence. If he were, his volitions would not be from eternity, nor would he be unchangeable. Therefore with as much rea&s;on, as it is &s;aid, that there is <HI>but one</HI> agent in the univer&s;e, it might have been &s;aid, that there is <HI>not one.</HI> Self-efficiency of volition is either nece&s;&s;ary to agency and action, or it is not. If it be nece&s;&s;ary, God is not an agent. If it be not nece&s;&s;ary, we are agents and God too.</P>
<P>It is further &s;aid, that on this plan of a moral ne|ce&s;&s;ity e&s;tabli&s;hed by God, all human actions are
<PB N="177" REF="032073_0175_0FF110DAF7858040">
nothing but the operations of God actuating men, as the &s;oul actuates the body.&mdash;If this mean, that God is the remote and fir&s;t cau&s;e of all things, and that he brings to pa&s;s all things and all human actions, either by an immediate influence, or by the intervention of &s;econd cau&s;es, motives, temptations, &amp;c. we allow it: We firmly believe, that the&s;e are under the con|trol and at the di&s;po&s;al of Providence. But becau&s;e the devil tempted Eve, it will not be pretended, that &s;he acted nothing, and was merely acted upon by the devil, as the human body is actuated by the &s;oul; that becau&s;e God &s;ent his prophets to the I&s;raelites, to preach to them, the prophets acted nothing; that when God affords the aids of his grace to any man, &s;o far as he is influenced by the&s;e aids to an action, it is no action of his; that when the goodne&s;s of God leadeth a &s;inner to repentance, the &s;inner does nothing, does not repent; but this repentance is the act or exer|ci&s;e of the divine mind, and in it God repents.</P>
<P>If when it is objected, the &s;cheme of moral nece&s;&s;ity precludes action, action mean volition; the objection is groundle&s;s: We hold as &s;trenuou&s;ly as our opponents, that we all have action in this &s;en&s;e. But if by action they mean any thing el&s;e, they mu&s;t mean &s;omething in which there is no volition. But that any &s;uch thing &s;hould be an action is ab&s;urd and what they will not pretend. The circum&s;tance, that a man cau&s;es his own volitions, if it were po&s;&s;ible, would not imply a|gency or action, unle&s;s the cau&s;ation or cau&s;ing act were a volition. For in&s;tance, if a man in a convul|&s;ion, having a &s;word in his hand, involuntarily thru&s;t it into his friend's bo&s;om, this is not agency: Yet the man cau&s;es the thru&s;t and the wound. But if the cau&s;ing act be a volition, it runs into the ab&s;urdity of an in|finite &s;eries of volitions cau&s;ing one another.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t, in Part II, p. 8, &s;ays,
<Q>If the Deity is the proper efficient cau&s;e of volition, then the mind is entirely pa&s;&s;ive in all its volitions, and con&s;equently cannot be in any <HI>proper</HI> &s;en&s;e <HI>an agent.</HI></Q>
We grant,
<PB N="178" REF="032073_0176_0FF111851F6BCED8">
that the Deity is the primary efficien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cau&s;e of all things, and that he produces volitions in the human mind by &s;uch &s;econd cau&s;es as motives, appetites, bia&s;es, &amp;c. and the human mind, in being the &s;ubject of the di|vine agency whether mediate or immediate, is pa&s;&s;ive. Still we hold, that volition is <HI>an action,</HI> as has been al|ready explained. Nor is there the lea&s;t ab&s;urdity in the &s;uppo&s;ition, that an action &s;hould be the effect of a divine or other extrin&s;ic agency, unle&s;s by action or volition be meant a &s;elf-cau&s;ed or an uncau&s;ed action or volition. But for Dr. We&s;t in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e to mean this <HI>by action in the proper &s;en&s;e,</HI> is to beg the que&s;tion. The very que&s;tion is, whether action in the proper &s;en&s;e of the word, be &s;elf-cau&s;ed or uncau&s;|ed. And if, when he &s;ays,
<Q>If the Deity is the effi|cient cau&s;e of volition, the mind cannot be in any <HI>proper</HI> &s;en&s;e an agent; he mean an agent, who efficiently produces an act of will in him&s;elf, or who is the &s;ubject of a volition which is uncau&s;ed; I grant, that the mind cannot be &s;uch an agent; I believe, that &s;uch agency is an ab&s;urdity and impo&s;&s;ibilty, and call on Dr. We&s;t to clear it of the ab&s;urdity and im|po&s;&s;ibility, which has long &s;ince been pointed out to be implied in it.</Q></P>
<P>Be&s;ides; the Doctor's rea&s;oning may be retorted, thus; If the mind it&s;elf be the proper efficient cau&s;e of volition, then the mind is entirely pa&s;&s;ive in its vo|litions, and con&s;equently in volition cannot be in any proper &s;en&s;e an agent. For every effect mu&s;t be pa&s;|&s;ive, &s;eeing it cannot contribute any thing towards its own exi&s;tence. Volition or the mind acting is either an effect, or it exi&s;ted from eternity, or it came into exi&s;tence without cau&s;e. Neither of the two la&s;t will be pretended. Therefore it is an effect; and as every effect is pa&s;&s;ive, the mind in volition is, on the ground of Dr. We&s;t's argument, in no proper &s;en&s;e an agent in volition.</P>
<P>The Doctor proceeds, ibid, p. 8.
<Q>Either volition is only the immediate action of the Deity on the mind,
<PB N="179" REF="032073_0177_0FF110D204B18DA8">
or it is di&s;tinct from it. If volition is di&s;tinct from the action of the Deity on the mind, then the action of the Deity on the mind, is only to produce all the requi&s;ites for action; and con&s;equently there is no ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing, that when all the&s;e requi&s;ites have taken place, the mind is then only put in a ca|pacity for acting.</Q>
&mdash;On this I remark, Volition is granted to be entirely di&s;tinct from the action of the Deity, as di&s;tinct from it, as the motion of a plan|et is. But it is not granted to follow hence, that the action of the Deity does no more than produce all the nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ites for action. Dr. We&s;t will grant, that when the Deity cau&s;es a planet to move, he does more than to produce the requi&s;ites for its mo|tion, unle&s;s in requi&s;ites for its motion be compre|hended the actual production of its motion. If this be his meaning with regard to the action of the mind, there is an ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing, that when all tho&s;e requi&s;ites have taken place, the mind is only put into a capacity for acting or not acting. And whatever be his meaning in producing requi&s;ites, I do not allow they do or can put the mind into a capacity of <HI>not acting, i. e.</HI> of &s;inking it&s;elf into perfect torpitude.</P>
<P>What immediately follows the la&s;t quotation is,
<Q>If be&s;ides pre&s;enting to the mind the requi&s;ites for ac|tion, the Deity does produce a certain modification of the mind called volition, in which modification the mind is wholly pa&s;&s;ive, then there is no action, but on|ly the immediate action of the Deity on the mind; and volition is nothing di&s;tinct from the immediate action of the Deity.</Q>
The very &s;ame mode of rea&s;oning will prove, that bodily motion is nothing di&s;tinct from the action of the Deity; thus, If be&s;ides producing the requi&s;ites for motion, the Deity produce a certain modification of matter, called motion, in which matter is wholly pa&s;|&s;ive, then there is only the immediate action of the Deity on matter, and motion is nothing di&s;tinct from the imme|diate action of the Deity.&mdash;Yet it is pre&s;umed, that Dr. We&s;t will not pretend, that when God cau&s;es a plan|et
<PB N="180" REF="032073_0178_0FF1115A5E9210A8">
to move round in its orbit, the Deity him&s;elf and he only moves round in that orbit; or that the mo|tion of the planet is nothing di&s;tinct from the action of the Deity. Now volition, though cau&s;ed by the Deity, is as di&s;tinct from the action of the Deity, by which it is cau&s;ed, as the motion of a planet is from the action of God by which that is cau&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Doctor &s;ays, p. 10,
<Q>If when the mind acts on any particular object, the Deity produces <HI>a new act</HI> or a new operativene&s;s in the mind, then there mu&s;t be a change in the mind.</Q>
Doubtle&s;s there is &s;o far a change, as is implied in the new act: And what then? Why the Doctor
<Q>upon the clo&s;e&s;t examination can|not find any change in the <HI>operativene&s;s</HI> of his mind.</Q>
Be it &s;o; yet as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that his mind is the &s;ub|ject of a new <HI>act,</HI> he can doubtle&s;s find a change in the <HI>act</HI> of his mind; and if he cannot find a change in the <HI>operativene&s;s</HI> of it, it mu&s;t be becau&s;e operative|ne&s;s, which is a peculiar and favourite word with the Doctor, means &s;omething different from <HI>act,</HI> and there|fore is nothing to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, as the &s;ubject under con&s;ideration is the production of a new act by the Deity: And we do not pretend, that when the Deity produces a new <HI>act</HI> in the mind, he produces a new <HI>operativene&s;s</HI> too, unle&s;s act and operativene&s;s be the &s;ame.

<P N="6">6. It is &s;aid to be &s;elf-evident, that <HI>ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity</HI> is incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>liberty.</HI>&mdash;An&s;wer; This wholly depends on the meaning of the words <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</HI> Ab&s;olute <HI>natural</HI> nece&s;&s;ity is allowed to be incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty; but the &s;ame conce&s;&s;ion is not made with regard to ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity. All that is requi&s;ite to an&s;wer this and &s;uch like ob|jections is to explain the words liberty and nece&s;&s;ity. If by <HI>liberty</HI> be meant <HI>uncertainty,</HI> undoubtedly ab&s;o|lute moral nece&s;&s;ity, which is the certainty of a moral event, is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty. But if by liberty be meant exemption from <HI>natural</HI> nece&s;&s;ity, there is not the lea&s;t incon&s;i&s;tence between the mo&s;t ab&s;olute <HI>moral</HI> nece&s;&s;ity and the mo&s;t perfect freedom or exemption from natural nece&s;&s;ity. The mo&s;t per|fect exemption from natural nece&s;&s;ity is con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute previous certainty of a moral action. Judas in betraying his Lord "according to the deter|minate coun&s;el and foreknowledge of God," was en|tirely exempted from natural nece&s;&s;ity; yet his con|duct was according to an ab&s;olute previous certainty.</P>
<P N="7">7. That we have liberty of &s;elf-determination is ar|gued from our <HI>moral di&s;cernment,</HI> or &s;en&s;e of right and wrong and of de&s;ert of prai&s;e and blame. And &s;ome are &s;o confident of the &s;ufficiency of this argument a|gain&s;t moral nece&s;&s;ity, that they are willing to re&s;t the whole cau&s;e on this &s;ingle point. It is therefore a very important point. It is &s;aid, that our e&s;timating the moral character of the man, from his internal di&s;|po&s;itions
<PB N="182" REF="032073_0180_0FF11189D4710070">
and acts, is on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the&s;e are <HI>within the power of</HI> the man. But the word <HI>power</HI> is equivocal; if it mean <HI>natural</HI> power, and that the agent is under no <HI>natural</HI> inability, (as before ex|plained) to other di&s;po&s;itions and acts; it is granted, that in this &s;en&s;e they are in his power. But if it mean, that there was no previous certainty, that he would have tho&s;e very di&s;po&s;itions and acts; and that no man will or can rea&s;onably blame him&s;elf or an|other but in ca&s;e of a perfect previous uncertainty with re&s;pect to tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions and acts; this is not granted, nor is it proved.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that no man ever did commend or blame him&s;elf for what he knew to be <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> and <HI>unavoid|able,</HI> not within his power, or not determined by him|&s;elf. This &s;tript of the ambiguity of words is this merely; that no man ever did commend or blame him|&s;elf for what he knew to be previou&s;ly certain, and was not entirely ca&s;ual. But this is manife&s;tly fal&s;e; becau&s;e every man knows or may know, that all things are previou&s;ly certain, as they are the objects of the in|fallible foreknowledge of God: And if no man can com|mend or blame him&s;elf for what is previou&s;ly certain, no man can commend or blame him&s;elf for any thing.</P>
<P>Will it be pretended, that we are more blamable for an action, which is previou&s;ly uncertain and ca&s;u|al, and which we perform by chance without motive, end or de&s;ign, than for that which is previou&s;ly cer|tain and future, and which we do from motive, and with an end and de&s;ign? Take the in&s;tance of Judas's treachery. The fact is, that this treachery was pre|viou&s;ly certain and infalliby foreknown by God. Now, was Judas le&s;s blamable than if his conduct had been previou&s;ly uncertain, and had taken place by pure chance? To &s;ay, that he was blamable, if this conduct proceeded from &s;elf-determination, affords no &s;atisfaction, unle&s;s this &s;elf-determination were by chance. For otherwi&s;e the &s;elf-determining act was pre|viou&s;ly certain and morally nece&s;&s;ary, and therefore li|able

to all the objections, which are brought again&s;t moral nece&s;&s;ity in any ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Blameworthine&s;s is nothing but moral turpitude or odiou&s;ne&s;s; prai&s;eworthine&s;s is nothing but moral amiablene&s;s or excellence. But the moral amiable|ne&s;s of an action does not depend on the circum&s;tance, that it is efficiently cau&s;ed by our&s;elves; becau&s;e this runs into the ab&s;urdity and impo&s;&s;ibility of an infinite &s;eries of actions cau&s;ing one another. Nor does it depend on this circum&s;tance, that the action is, as Dr. We&s;t holds, uncau&s;ed; for no actions of creatures fall under this de&s;cription. Either of tho&s;e hypothe|&s;es would &s;hut moral amiablene&s;s and odiou&s;ne&s;s out of the world.</P>
<P>That moral nece&s;&s;ity or previous certainty of mor|al conduct is con&s;i&s;tent with moral di&s;cernment, may be argued from the ca&s;e of the &s;aints and angels in heaven. It will not be pretended, but that there is a certainty, that they will continue in their &s;tate of perfect holine&s;s and happine&s;s to eternity. Nor will it be pretended, but that they are the &s;ubjects of mor|al di&s;cernment and of that virtue and holine&s;s which is truly amiable in the moral &s;en&s;e, and the proper object of approbation and reward. Therefore moral nece&s;&s;ity is not incon&s;i&s;tent with prai&s;e and blame.</P>
<P>I need not in&s;i&s;t on the nece&s;&s;ary holine&s;s of God and of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The writers in oppo&s;ition to moral nece&s;&s;ity in&s;i&s;t much on its incon&s;i&s;tence with accountablene&s;s. This is really no other than to in&s;i&s;t, that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with prai&s;e and blame or with moral agency; and is the &s;ame objection, which we have been con&s;idering. To be accountable is to be liable to be called to an account for an action, and to be the proper &s;ubject of reward or puni&s;hment. But this is no other than to be worthy of prai&s;e or blame, and to de&s;erve love or hatred, complacency or di&s;approbation, on account of moral temper or conduct. So that what has been
<PB N="184" REF="032073_0182_0FF1115D74A7E778">
&s;aid concerning prai&s;e and blame, is equally applica|ble to accountablene&s;s.</P>
<P>It has been long &s;ince &s;hown by Pre&s;ident Edwards, that the moral amiablene&s;s and odiou&s;ne&s;s of actions, and their de&s;ert of prai&s;e or blame, or the e&s;&s;ence of virtue and vice, depend not on the circum&s;tance, that actions are efficiently cau&s;ed by the &s;ubject; but that the acts them&s;elves, without any con&s;ideration of their efficient cau&s;e, are amiable or odious: As oth|erwi&s;e virtue and vice will be thrown back from the cau&s;ed act, to the cau&s;ing act, till they are thrown out of the univer&s;e. If they con&s;i&s;t not in acts of the will them&s;elves, but in the acts by which they are cau&s;ed, as the&s;e cau&s;ing acts are al&s;o cau&s;ed, virtue and vice mu&s;t for the &s;ame rea&s;on con&s;i&s;t not in them, but tho&s;e by which they are cau&s;ed, and &s;o on to an act which is not cau&s;ed. But this being not cau&s;ed by the &s;ubject, can, on the principle of our opponents, have no virtue or vice in it. Thus there would be no place found in the univer&s;e for virtue and vice: Not in the cau&s;ed acts, becau&s;e virtue and vice con|&s;i&s;t not in them, but in their cau&s;e. Not in any un|cau&s;ed act or acts, becau&s;e they, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, are not cau&s;ed by their &s;ubject. There is no way to avoid this con&s;equence, but to allow that virtue and vice, de&s;ert of prai&s;e and blame, con&s;i&s;t, in the acts them&s;elves and not in their cau&s;e; or if there be any virtue or vice in the cau&s;e, this is di&s;tinct from the virtue or vice, which there is in the acts them|&s;elves. If I be accountable for any volition, for the &s;ole rea&s;on, that I cau&s;e it; then I am accountable for the act, by which I cau&s;e it, for the &s;ole rea&s;on, that I cau&s;e that, and &s;o on in an infinite &s;eries.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; the mere circum&s;tance, that I cau&s;e my own volition, does not on the principles of our oppo|nents, make me accountable for it: Becau&s;e that I &s;hould cau&s;e it may be a matter of previous certain|ty, as it may be foreknown, and even decreed, by God, that I &s;hall cau&s;e it; and therefore I cau&s;e it
<PB N="185" REF="032073_0183_0FF1115FCF4E9FF8">
not freely in the &s;en&s;e of our opponents, but nece&s;&s;a|rily, under the influence of ab&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>But Dr. We&s;t holds, that all our volitions are with|out cau&s;e. Then they take place by blind fate or chance. And how, on his principles, are we accountable for them?</P>
<P>The true ground of accountablene&s;s and of prai&s;e and blame, is not the circum&s;tance, that we our&s;elves efficiently cau&s;e our own volitions&punc; or the circum|&s;tance, that they take place without cau&s;e, by mere chance; but the nature, moral a&s;pect and tendency of tho&s;e volitions, and of the actions which flow from them.</P>
<P>Our opponents ob&s;erve, that we allow, that men mu&s;t be the voluntary cau&s;es of their external actions, in order to be accountable for them: And then they a&s;k, why we do not for the &s;ame rea&s;on allow, that we mu&s;t be the voluntary cau&s;es of our acts of will, that we may be accountable for them? The an&s;wer is, that external actions are not volitions. The volitions of rational beings, are in their own nature moral acts, and for that rea&s;on the &s;ubjects of them are accountable for them. But external actions are not of a moral nature in them&s;elves, and therefore the &s;ubjects of them are ac|countable for them then only, when they are the effects of volition. Be&s;ides; that external actions &s;hould be the effects of volition does not run into the ab&s;urdity of an infinite &s;eries, as is implied in the &s;uppo&s;ition, that all volitions are the effects of previous volitions.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t &s;ays,

Where he has &s;hown this, he has not informed us. If he had, perhaps his readers, on pe|ru&s;al of the pa&s;&s;age, would not have joined with him in the opinion, that he had &s;hown it. For my part, I cannot find, that he has &s;hown it in any part of his two books.&mdash;If moral nece&s;&s;ity, which is previous certain futurity of a moral act,

of things, or in divine foreknowledge, what his actions will be; <HI>i. e.</HI> he mu&s;t act by mere chance.</Q></P>
<P N="8">8. It is objected, that this doctrine of moral nece&s;|&s;ity makes men mere machines.&mdash;This objection, which is frequently made by all our opponents, de|pends on the &s;en&s;e affixed to the word <HI>machine.</HI> If it mean an intelligent voluntary agent, who does not act by perfect contingence or chance, and who does not take one &s;tep before his fir&s;t &s;tep; but acts from &s;uch motives and pur&s;ues &s;uch objects, as appear to him mo&s;t eligible; I grant, that we are machines: And in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e the &s;aints and angels in heaven, and all intelligent beings, are machines. But whether it be not a great abu&s;e of language, and whether it be not an artifice of our opponents, to excite a popular pre|judice and clamour again&s;t our doctrine, to u&s;e the word <HI>machine</HI> in this &s;en&s;e; I leave the reader to judge.&mdash;If by <HI>machine</HI> be meant, what is common|ly meant by it, a mere material engine, without voli|tion, knowledge or thought in it&s;elf; I pre&s;ume, that our opponents them&s;elves will not pretend, that on our principles, men are &s;uch machines as this.</P>
<P>Do tho&s;e who make this objection, hold, that the human under&s;tanding is a <HI>machine?</HI> Or that, in under|&s;tanding, rea&s;oning, judging, remembering, &amp;c. man acts mechanically? Yet all grant, that in the&s;e things he acts nece&s;&s;arily.</P>
<P>If moral nece&s;&s;ity imply, that we are machines, then whatever induces a moral nece&s;&s;ity, or actually influ|ences or per&s;uades us to any conduct, turns us into ma|chines. Now the oppo&s;ers of moral nece&s;&s;ity often &s;peak of the aids of grace and of the Spirit, as nece&s;|&s;ary and influential to virtue and religion. But if any man become the &s;ubject of true virtue or piety <HI>by the aids of God's grace,</HI> &s;o far he is pa&s;&s;ive, he is wrought upon and governed by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, and his conduct is the effect of that cau&s;e. But every effect is <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> with re&s;pect to its cau&s;e. Therefore whoever is led by this cau&s;e to virtue or
<PB N="187" REF="032073_0185_0FF1118C1DA82DA8">
piety, is led nece&s;&s;arily, and according to the objec|tion now before us&punc; is turned into a mere <HI>machine.</HI>&mdash; On the ground of this objection all &s;inners abandon|ed by God, all the damned and devils in hell, all the &s;aints and angels in heaven, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and even God him&s;elf, are mere <HI>machines.</HI>&mdash;How nece&s;|&s;ary it is, that tho&s;e who make an objection to any &s;y&s;tem, &s;hould con&s;ider fir&s;t whether the objection be not equally forcible again&s;t doctrines which they them&s;elves hold!</P>
<P N="9">9. It is further objected, that moral nece&s;&s;ity places men, with re&s;pect to liberty, on a level with brutes.&mdash; If by liberty be meant contingence or previous un|certainty, I grant that the actions of men and brutes are in this &s;en&s;e equally void of liberty; a previous certainty attends them equally. Or if it could be made to appear, that the actions of men are previ|ou&s;ly uncertain; I &s;hould maintain, that tho&s;e of brutes are equally uncertain, and in this &s;en&s;e equally free.&mdash;If by liberty be meant exemption from ex|trin&s;ic cau&s;ality of volition; I grant, that in this &s;en&s;e al&s;o the actions of men and brutes are equally void of liberty. Men no more manufacture their own volitions, than brutes; and there is no more ev|idence, that men act without motive or de&s;ign, than that brutes do. But if by liberty be meant <HI>rational</HI> liberty, the liberty of <HI>a moral</HI> agent, I hold that men are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this, and brutes not. Brutes are no moral agents; but it is for the want of rea&s;on and intelligence, not of any power of will. If Sir I&s;aac Newton's hor&s;e had had as much rea&s;on and knowl|edge as his ma&s;ter, he no doubt would have had as much moral liberty, and would have been equally a moral agent and equally accountable. Without rea|&s;on and intelligence, though a hor&s;e &s;hould have a liberty of perfect uncertainty and act by the pure&s;t chance; and though he &s;hould propagate one voli|tion by another, or without another, with ever &s;o great dexterity; he would be a brute &s;till, and no more a
<PB N="188" REF="032073_0186_0FF110C8E12780C8">
moral agent, than he is now that he acts by motive or appetite. So that the difference between a man and a bea&s;t, as to moral agency, con&s;i&s;ts not in liber|ty of contingence or liberty of &s;elf-determination; but in rea&s;on and knowledge.</P>
<P>We might on this &s;ubject venture to turn the tables on our opponents, and hold, that if a power of &s;elf-de|termination be liberty, brutes are free as well as men. The a&s;s determining to eat of one of two equally good bundles of hay, is as good an in&s;tance to prove, that &s;he has a &s;elf-determining power, as any brought to prove it in men. So that if tho&s;e in&s;tances prove it in men, this proves it in brutes. Self-determining power then is nothing di&s;tinctive between men and brutes.</P>
<P>The capacity of con&s;idering and judging, of di&s;|tingui&s;hing virtue and vice, of deliberating, rea&s;oning, reflecting, and &s;u&s;pending, have been mentioned as di&s;tingui&s;hing between men and brutes. But all the&s;e, except <HI>&s;u&s;pending,</HI> are acts of the intellect, not of the will: And &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, though an act of the will, does not appear to imply &s;elf-determination more than any other act of the will. Be&s;ides; brutes &s;u&s;|pend, as well as men. A dog in que&s;t of his ma&s;ter, will &s;u&s;pend proceeding in any road, till he is &s;atisfied, in which his ma&s;ter has gone. And &s;heep, a more &s;tupid race, on hearing a dog bark, will often &s;u&s;|pend their flight, till they &s;ee from what quarter their enemy is approaching.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that external liberty and &s;pontaneity be|long to brutes and mad men, as well as to rational men. Be it &s;o; yet the power and proper exerci&s;e of rea&s;on does not belong to them.&mdash;It is &s;aid, that if an action's being voluntary makes it virtuous or vicious; then brutes would be the &s;ubjects of virtue or vice. But merely that an action is voluntary does not con&s;titute it virtuous or vicious. It mu&s;t be&s;ides be the action of a rational being.</P>
<P>Dr. Clarke, the greate&s;t champion for the &s;elf-determining power, expre&s;sly grants that chil|dren,
<PB N="189" REF="032073_0187_0FF1118DC7A2E138">
bea&s;ts and even every living creature po&s;&s;e&s;s it. Remarks on Collins, p. 27.
<Q>The actions of <HI>chil|dren,</HI> and the actions of <HI>every living creature</HI> are all of them <HI>e&s;&s;entially free.</HI> The mechanical and involuntary motion of their bodies, &s;uch as the pul|&s;ation of the heart and the like, are indeed all nec|e&s;&s;ary; but they are none of them <HI>actions.</HI> Every <HI>action,</HI> every motion ari&s;ing from the <HI>&s;elf-moving principle,</HI> is e&s;&s;entially <HI>free.</HI> The difference is this only, in men this phy&s;ical liberty is joined with a &s;en&s;e or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of moral good or evil, and is therefore eminently called liberty. In bea&s;ts the &s;ame phy&s;ical liberty or &s;elf-moving power, is wholly &s;eparate from a &s;en&s;e or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s or ca|pacity of judging of moral good or evil and is vul|garly called &s;pontaneity. In <HI>children</HI> the &s;ame phy&s;ical liberty always is from the very beginning; and in proportion as they increa&s;e in age and in ca|pacity of judging, they grow continually <HI>in degree</HI> not more <HI>free,</HI> but more <HI>moral,</HI> agents.</Q>
Thus we have the Doctor's authority, that children and bea&s;ts po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;elf-determining power, as well as men, and that they are not only as really free as men, but that their freedom is <HI>in degree</HI> equal to that of men; and that what they want to con&s;titute them <HI>moral</HI> agents, is not <HI>liberty,</HI> but <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and a capacity of judging.</P>
<P N="10">10. Much has been &s;aid by Dr. Clarke and oth|ers after him, concerning the <HI>beginning of motion;</HI> by <HI>motion</HI> meaning <HI>volition,</HI> if they mean any thing to the purpo&s;e. The argument is, that if motion, <HI>i. e.</HI> volition, had a beginning, it was begun by God, and of cour&s;e he had a &s;elf-moving or &s;elf-determining power, a power efficiently to cau&s;e volition in him|&s;elf, and actually did thus cau&s;e it. That volition even in the Deity had a beginning, the Doctor ar|gues thus;
<Q>Motion mu&s;t either finally be re&s;olved into a fir&s;t mover, in whom con&s;equently there is liberty of action,</Q>
<HI>i. e.</HI> &s;elf-determination,
<Q>or el&s;e into an infinite chain of cau&s;es and effects without
<PB N="190" REF="032073_0188_0FF1114E86260D08">
any cau&s;e at all; which is an expre&s;s contradiction, except motion could be nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;tent in its own nature; which that it is not, is evident, be|cau&s;e the idea of re&s;t is no contradiction; and al&s;o be|cau&s;e there being no motion without a particular determination one certain way, and no one deter|mination being more nece&s;&s;ary than another, an e&s;|&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary tendency to motion in all de|terminations equally, could never have produced any motion at all.</Q>
<HI>Remarks on Collins,</HI> p. 11, 12. Motion throughout this quotation means internal mo|tion or volition&punc; or the whole is nothing to the pur|po&s;e. I grant that external motion, the motion of matter, had a beginning, and that after the creation of matter. But the whole que&s;tion is concerning vo|lition, the act or motion of the mind. That this is not nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;tent, and therefore not from eter|nity, the Doctor argues fir&s;t from this, that "the idea of re&s;t," <HI>i. e.</HI> of an entire ab&s;ence or non-exi&s;tence of volition, "is no contradiction." It is doubtle&s;s as much and in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e a contradiction, as the idea of the entire non-exi&s;tence of knowledge or in|telligence, or of all being: And if this argument prove, that volition had a beginning, it will equally prove, that knowledge or the divine exi&s;tence had a begin|ning. Volition is ju&s;t as nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;tent as God is; without volition he would not be God. It is impo&s;|&s;ible, that God &s;hould from eternity have intelligence and not from eternity have volition.</P>
<P>The Doctor goes on to argue the beginning of vo|lition thus;
<Q>There being no motion, <HI>i. e.</HI> volition, without a particular determination one certain way, and no one determination being in nature more nece&s;&s;ary than another, an e&s;&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary tendency to volition in all determinations equally, could never have produced any volition at all.</Q>
On this I ob&s;erve,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That by the &s;ame argument all intellectual ideas and perceptions of happine&s;s in the divine mind have

a beginning; thus, There being no intellectual idea without a particular determination one way, and no one determination being in nature more nece&s;&s;ary than another, an e&s;&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary tendency to all determinations of idea equally, could never have produced any idea at all.

But an e&s;&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary tendency to exi&s;tence in all forms and kinds equally, could never have been the foundation of any particular being at all.</P>
<P>If in the&s;e ca&s;es it &s;hould be objected, that one determination of idea is in nature more nece&s;&s;ary than another; that which is according to truth and fact, is more nece&s;&s;ary than that which is contrary to truth; and that feeling of happine&s;s, and that form of exi&s;t|ence which is mo&s;t complete and perfect, is more nece&s;&s;ary, than that which is le&s;s perfect: I an&s;wer, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, it mu&s;t be granted, that the vo|lition which is mo&s;t rational, wi&s;e and holy, is more nece&s;&s;ary, than that which is le&s;s wi&s;e and holy; and therefore this particular volition or determination of will is nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;tent in its own nature, and is without beginning.</P>
<P N="2">2. From the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the volitions of God are not eternal and as nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;tent as the di|vine knowledge or divine exi&s;tence, it follows, that he is very far from an unchangeable being; that from eternity he exi&s;ted without any volition or choice of

one thing in preference to another; that when the eternity <HI>a parte ante,</HI> as it is called, had run out, he began to will and choo&s;e, and from that time he has been the &s;ubject of various acts of will, but never before, and therefore has been the &s;ubject of a very great change.</P>
<P>That God &s;hould from eternity exi&s;t without vo|lition, and that in time he &s;hould become the &s;ubject of volition, implies not only a very great change in God, but that from eternity he was not a voluntary agent, and therefore no agent at all. So that the very argument which Dr. Clarke u&s;es to prove, that God is a &s;elf-determinate agent, in fact does, directly contrary to his intention, prove, that he was from eter|nity no agent at all.</P>
<P>If God began volition in him&s;elf, he began it either voluntarily or involuntarily. If he began it voluntarily, he would be the &s;ubject of an infinite &s;eries of volitions cau&s;ing one another; which is an ab&s;urdity, impo&s;&s;ibili|ty and contradiction. If he began it involuntarily, he did not begin it freely.</P>
<P>In his remarks on Collins, p. 6, Dr. Clarke &s;ays,
<Q>To be an agent &s;ignifies, to have a power of begin|ning motion.</Q>
<HI>Motion</HI> here, if it be at all to the purpo&s;e, mu&s;t mean <HI>volition</HI>: And to &s;ay,
<Q>To be an agent &s;ignifies to have a power of beginning volition. is a &s;ervile begging of the que&s;tion, utterly unworthy of Dr. Clarke.</Q></P>
<P>In the &s;ame book, p. 44, he ob&s;erves,
<Q>That if mo|tion exi&s;t nece&s;&s;arily of it&s;elf&mdash;with a determina|tion one certain way; then that determination is nece&s;&s;ary, and con&s;equently all other determina|tions impo&s;&s;ible; which is contrary to experience.</Q>
And how does it appear by experience, that any oth|er determinations of will are, or ever were, po&s;&s;ible in the divine mind, than that which actually exi&s;ts in it? Did Dr. Clarke experience divine exerci&s;es, and find by that experience, that other volitions are po&s;|&s;ible in God than what actually exi&s;t? Surely this
<PB N="193" REF="032073_0191_0FF11135BAA20A50">
was written by the Doctor with great inattention!&mdash; If to &s;ave the Doctor it &s;hould be &s;aid, that this ob|&s;ervation relates not to volition, but to the motion of matter; this, if it were the meaning of the Doctor, would argue equal inattention. Would he have im|agined, that becau&s;e the motion of matter is not from eternity and nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;tent; therefore the &s;ame is true of thought and volition?</P>
<P N="11">11.

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII. In which is con&s;idered the Objection, that Moral Nece&s;&s;i|ty implies, that God is the Author of Sin.</HEAD>
<P>IT is objected to the doctrine of moral nece&s;&s;ity, that &s;ince this nece&s;&s;ity and the connection between motives and volitions are e&s;tabli&s;hed by God, he is the author of all the &s;in and wickedne&s;s in the uni|ver&s;e; that he by the motives which he lays before creatures, tempts them to &s;in, and is him&s;elf an&s;wera|ble for all the &s;in committed by them. And a great deal of vehement declamation is poured out on this &s;ubject, well &s;uited to take hold of the feelings and pa&s;&s;ions of men, but not to inform their under&s;tand|ings and a&s;&s;i&s;t their rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to a more direct and particular con&s;ideration of this objection, it is proper to &s;how in what &s;en&s;e the advocates for moral nece&s;&s;ity hold that the divine agency is concerned in the exi&s;tence of &s;in.</P>
<P N="1">1. They do hold, that all nece&s;&s;ity and certainty or certain futurity, whether of natural or moral events, is e&s;tabli&s;hed by God; of cour&s;e that the connection between all cau&s;es and effects, and particularly the connection between motives and volitions, is e&s;tab|li&s;hed by the &s;ame &s;upreme agent.</P>
<P N="2">2. They hold, that all things, which come to pa&s;s in time, were certainly foreordained by God from e|ternity; that he foreordained them not in con&s;equence of fore&s;eeing, that the free will of man will bring them into exi&s;tence&punc; but the free will of man brings them into exi&s;tence, in con&s;equence of the divine de|cree, &s;o far as that will does at all bring them into ex|i&s;tence.</P>
<P N="3">3. They hold, that whatever &s;in takes place among creatures, takes place not by the bare permi&s;&s;ion or non-influence of God; but under his &s;uperintend|ing
<PB N="196" REF="032073_0194_0FF1116642C17D78">
providence, and in con&s;equence of his di&s;po&s;ing things &s;o, that &s;in certainly or with moral nece&s;&s;ity, follows.&mdash;Pre&s;ident Edwards has explained him&s;elf fully on this head. Inquiry, p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">4;
<Q>If by <HI>the au|thor of &s;in</HI> be meant the <HI>&s;inner,</HI> the <HI>agent</HI> or <HI>actor</HI> of &s;in, or the doer of a wicked thing; &s;o it would be a reproach and bla&s;phemy, to &s;uppo&s;e God to be <HI>the author of &s;in.</HI> In this &s;en&s;e I utterly deny God to be the author of &s;in; rejecting &s;uch an imputation on the Mo&s;t High, as what is infinitely to be abhor|red; and deny any &s;uch thing to be the con&s;e|quence of what I have laid down. But if by <HI>author of &s;in</HI> is meant the permitter or not hinderer of &s;in, and at the &s;ame time, a <HI>di&s;po&s;er of the &s;tate of events in &s;uch a manner,</HI> for wi&s;e, holy and mo&s;t excellent ends and purpo&s;es, THAT SIN, if it be permitted and not hinder|ed, WILL MOST CERTAINLY FOLLOW&mdash;I do not deny, that God is the author of &s;in&mdash;it is no re|proach for the Mo&s;t High to be <HI>thus</HI> the author of &s;in.</Q></P>
<P>The objections again&s;t &s;uch an agency of God in the exi&s;tence of &s;in, as has been now de&s;cribed, are two; (1) That &s;uch divine agency is incon&s;i&s;tent with human liberty, moral agency and accountablene&s;s: (2) That it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the perfect holine&s;s of God.&mdash;Before I an&s;wer the&s;e objections di&s;tinctly, I wi&s;h it to be ob&s;erved, that they are incon&s;i&s;tent and mutually de&s;troy each other.</P>
<P>If the divine agency in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of moral nece&s;&s;ity and the connection between motives and vo|litions, be incon&s;i&s;tent with our liberty and moral a|gency; then God in e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity of any action in us, which we call &s;in, is not the cau&s;e or author of <HI>&s;in</HI>; for his agency &s;o far from produc|ing &s;in in us, renders us <HI>incapable</HI> of &s;in. Suppo&s;e God with moral nece&s;&s;ity influence a man to kill an|other with malice prepen&s;e; if this nece&s;&s;itating influ|ence as really de&s;troy his moral agency, as if it turn|ed him into a windmill, though the man kills the other&punc; he commits no more &s;in in it, than if a windmill
<PB N="197" REF="032073_0195_0FF11137846899E0">
had killed him; and con&s;equently God is no more the author of &s;in in this in&s;tance, than if he had in|fluenced the windmill to kill him, or had fir&s;t turned the man into a windmill, and this windmill had in the cour&s;e of providence been the in&s;trument of his death. So that they who hold, that moral nece&s;&s;ity is incon&s;i&s;tent with moral agency, mu&s;t never object, that God is <HI>the author of &s;in,</HI> by e&s;tabli&s;hing that nece&s;+&s;ity, and thus acts incon&s;i&s;tently with his perfect holine&s;s.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if God do influence any man to <HI>commit &s;in,</HI> and thus act incon&s;i&s;tently with his perfect holine&s;s, the man is a moral agent notwith&s;tanding &s;uch influence, and there is no foundation to object, that the influence is incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty and moral agen|cy; and they who object that &s;uch influence implies, that God is the author of <HI>&s;in,</HI> mu&s;t forever be &s;ilent concerning the incon&s;i&s;tency of that influence with human liberty and moral agency.</P>
<P>If moral nece&s;&s;ity be incon&s;i&s;tent with moral agency, it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible and contradictory for God to di&s;po&s;e things &s;o, that &s;in will certainly or with moral nece&s;&s;ity follow. For on this &s;uppo&s;ition whatever cer|tainly follows &s;uch a di&s;po&s;al cannot be &s;in or any other moral act, as moral agency is in the ca&s;e de&s;troyed by the di&s;po&s;al. Therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible, that God in this way &s;hould cau&s;e &s;in, and therefore it is ab&s;urd and &s;elf-contradictory in tho&s;e who hold, that moral nece&s;&s;ity is incon&s;i&s;tent with moral agency, to charge us with bla&s;phemy, as they frequently do, becau&s;e we avow the &s;entiment, that God &s;o di&s;po&s;es events that &s;in certainly follows.</P>
<P>Yet &s;o far as I know, all tho&s;e who oppo&s;e moral nece&s;&s;ity, make both the objections before mentioned, and thus pull down with one hand, what they build up with the other. This is eminently true of Dr. We&s;t.</P>
<P>I now proceed to con&s;ider tho&s;e objections di&s;|tinctly.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is objected, that a divine agency e&s;tabli&s;hing a moral nece&s;&s;ity of &s;in, is incon&s;i&s;tent with human
<PB N="198" REF="032073_0196_0FF1119225865A90">
liberty, moral agency and accountablene&s;s.&mdash; An&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">: The divine agency in this ca&s;e is no more incon&s;i&s;tent with human liberty, &amp;c. than the moral nece&s;&s;ity which it e&s;tabli&s;hes. If this nece&s;&s;ity be incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty, be it &s;o; the divine agency which cau&s;es it, does not increa&s;e the incon&s;i&s;tency, beyond what would be, if that nece&s;&s;ity took place without &s;uch agency. A mountain placed acro&s;s the channel of a river, may be incon&s;i&s;tent with the river's flowing in that channel. But whether it were placed there by God, were con&s;tructed there by human art and labour, or happened there without cau&s;e, are que&s;tions immaterial as to the river's running in that channel, &s;o long as the mountain is the very &s;ame. Therefore let our opponents prove, that moral nece&s;|&s;ity or a previous certainty of moral actions, is incon&s;i&s;t|ent with moral agency, and that moral agents mu&s;t act by perfect contingence, mere chance and blind fate, and they will carry their point, without &s;aying a word concerning the divine agency: And until they prove this, whatever they may &s;ay concerning the divine agency, will &s;erve no good purpo&s;e to their cau&s;e, as to this part of the argument.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is objected, that for God to e&s;tabli&s;h a moral nece&s;&s;ity of &s;in, or as Pre&s;ident Edwards expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q>for God to di&s;po&s;e of the &s;tate of events in &s;uch a manner, for wi&s;e, holy and mo&s;t excellent ends, that &s;in will mo&s;t certainly and infallibly follow; is incon&s;i&s;tent with the perfect holine&s;s of God.&mdash;</Q>
But in what re&s;pects is it incon&s;i&s;tent with his holine&s;s? Or for what rea&s;ons are we to conclude, that it is in|con&s;i&s;tent with his holine&s;s? So far as I have been able to collect the rea&s;ons from the able&s;t writers on that &s;ide of the que&s;tion, they are the&s;e:</P>
<P N="1">(1) That whatever is in the effect is in the cau&s;e, and the nature of every cau&s;e may be known by the effect. Therefore if God &s;o order things, that &s;in will certainly follow, he is the cau&s;e of &s;in, and therefore is &s;inful him&s;elf.&mdash;If this argument be good, God
<PB N="199" REF="032073_0197_0FF1114C25CF13C0">
is the &s;ubject of pain, &s;ickne&s;s and death, &s;ince he is the cau&s;e of them: He is material and is the &s;ubject of all the properties of matter, exten&s;ion, &s;olidity, mo|bility, figure, colour, &amp;c. becau&s;e he created matter and all its properties. Yea he &s;uffers the torments of hell, becau&s;e he inflicts them.&mdash;This argument, though urged by men of great fame, is too weak and ab&s;urd to bear in&s;pection!</P>
<P N="2">(2) If God di&s;po&s;e things &s;o, that &s;in will certainly follow; he doubtle&s;s takes plea&s;ure in &s;in, and this implies &s;in in God him&s;elf.&mdash;If God do take a di|rect and immediate complacency in &s;in, it is granted, that this would imply &s;in in God. But if he choo&s;e the exi&s;tence of &s;in as a mean of good only, as pain and &s;ickne&s;s may be the means of good; this implies no &s;in in God. Nor does it follow from his di&s;po&s;ing things &s;o, that &s;in certainly takes place, that he do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> directly delight in &s;in it&s;elf ab&s;tractly con&s;idered, any more than it follows from his inflicting &s;ickne&s;s and mi&s;ery on his creatures, that he takes a direct com|placency in the&s;e. And we do not allow, but utterly deny, that God from a direct complacencey in &s;in di&s;po&s;es things &s;o, that it certainly follows. If our op|ponents believe that a direct complacency of God in &s;in is implied in our doctrine, it behoves them to make it out, and not to take it for granted.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t in&s;i&s;ts on this argument, Part II, p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.
<Q>If the Deity produces &s;inful volitions&mdash;then &s;in is his own work&mdash;and then he cannot hate &s;in, but mu&s;t love it and delight in it.</Q>
It &s;eems the Doctor fore&s;aw that to this argument it would be an|&s;wered that God's producing &s;in in the manner before explained, no more implies a direct complacency in it, than his producing <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> implies a direct compla|cency in that; and he replies, that
<Q>the two ca&s;es are by no means parallel&mdash;that the Deity is no where repre&s;ented as being angry at his creatures, becau&s;e they &s;uffer pain and di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;whereas with regard to moral evil, God is always repre&s;ented
<PB N="200" REF="032073_0198_0FF111B0C1EEB0A0">
as hating it, and puni&s;hing the impenitent.</Q>
To this I rejoin, that the want of paralleli&s;m does not ap|pear. For though God is not repre&s;ented to be an|gry at <HI>pain</HI> and <HI>mi&s;ery,</HI> as they are not the prope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ob|jects of anger; yet he is repre&s;ented to be di&s;plea&s;ed with them; and anger is only one kind of di&s;plea&s;ure, di&s;plea&s;ure at moral evil. And if God do produce a thing, with which he is di&s;plea&s;ed, why may he not produce a thing with which he is angry, and which he is di&s;po&s;ed to puni&s;h as it de&s;erves? Let a rea&s;on be given, why he may not do the latter, as well as the former.</P>
<P N="3">(3) God hates &s;in and doubtle&s;s he mu&s;t hate to bring it into exi&s;tence; and therefore he will not &s;o di&s;|po&s;e things, that it will certainly come into exi&s;tence. But God hates the pain, mi&s;ery and death of his crea|tures in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, that he hates &s;in; yet we find in fact, that he does di&s;po&s;e things &s;o, that they do take place among his creatures.</P>
<P N="4">(4) That God &s;hould &s;o di&s;po&s;e of events, that &s;in is the certain con&s;equence, is doing evil, that good may come of it; which is contrary to &s;cripture, as well as rea&s;on.&mdash;This is merely a&s;&s;erting, but not proving what is a&s;&s;erted. How does it appear, that for God &s;o to di&s;po&s;e of events, that &s;in is the certain con&s;equence, and this to &s;ub&s;erve the mo&s;t wi&s;e and holy purpo&s;es, is doing evil? To do evil is to commit &s;in; and to &s;ay that this is to commit &s;in, is to beg the que&s;tion. Let it be proved to imply, that God commits &s;in, and the point is gained. We a&s;|&s;ert, that to &s;ay, &s;uch a di&s;po&s;al implies, that God com|mits &s;in, is as groundle&s;s a propo&s;ition, as to &s;ay, that if God &s;o di&s;po&s;e of events, that &s;ickne&s;s is the certain con&s;equence, implies, that God him&s;elf is &s;ick. I pre&s;ume, it will not be denied, that God did &s;o di&s;|po&s;e of events, that the certain con&s;equence would be that Jo&s;eph &s;hould be &s;old into Egypt, and that our Saviour &s;hould be crucified. Nor will it be denied, that God made this di&s;po&s;ition of events with a holy

and wi&s;e purpo&s;e. And if God may do this in one or two in&s;tances; why may he not do the &s;ame in every in&s;tance, in which &s;in actually exi&s;ts?</P>
<P N="5">(5) That God &s;hould make an e&s;tabli&s;hment where|by any creature is laid under a moral nece&s;&s;ity of &s;in|ning is a great injury, both to the creature him&s;elf, and al&s;o to the &s;y&s;tem; as all &s;in is injurious to the &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;An&s;wer: What injury can be pretended to be done to the creature, who is the &s;ubject of the &s;in, in the ca&s;e de&s;cribed, &s;o long as his liberty and moral agency remain entire? And they do remain entire by the &s;uppo&s;ition; el&s;e he would be incapable of &s;in. A creature which is not, and &s;o long as it remains to be, not a moral agent, cannot be influenced even by God him&s;elf to commit &s;in: It would imply a contra|diction. So that there is no foundation for com|plaint, that the &s;ubject is injured, by being laid un|der a moral nece&s;&s;ity, or previous certainty, of &s;in|ning.&mdash;Be&s;ides; this objection implies, that every moral agent is injured, unle&s;s it be a matter of per|fect uncertainty, what his future actions &s;hall be, un|certainty not only to him&s;elf and all creatures, but to God and in the nature of things: <HI>i. e.</HI> every moral agent is injured, unle&s;s he be left to act by pure chance.</P>
<P>With regard to injury to the &s;y&s;tem of intelligent beings, there is, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till le&s;s foundation for ob|jection on this ground. For it is a part of the doc|trine of moral nece&s;&s;ity, that God never e&s;tabli&s;hes it, excepting when it's e&s;tabli&s;hment is &s;ub&s;ervient and nece&s;&s;ary to the general good of that &s;y&s;tem, implying the divine glory; and to be &s;ure, that God never &s;o di&s;po&s;es of events, that &s;in certainly follows, unle&s;s &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ation is nece&s;&s;ary to the general good: Nor ought the contrary to be taken for granted. If God do in any in&s;tance &s;o di&s;po&s;e of events, that &s;in certainly follows, when the exi&s;tence of that &s;in is not nece&s;&s;ary to the general good, but injurious to it; I confe&s;s, I &s;ee not how in this ca&s;e, the divine holine&s;s
<PB N="202" REF="032073_0200_0FF111A01DB7BA20">
can be vindicated. But this is nothing peculiar to the introduction of &s;in. It would al&s;o be incon&s;i&s;tent with the divine perfect holine&s;s and wi&s;dom to create matter, or to cau&s;e holine&s;s, in &s;uch circum&s;tances as to di&s;&s;erve the general good.</P>
<P N="6">(6) It is inquired, Where is the con&s;i&s;tence between God's laying a man under a moral nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning, and then puni&s;hing him for that &s;in?&mdash;I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. How can God con&s;i&s;tently make a man &s;ick, and then apply medicines or any remedy toward his re&s;toration? Puni&s;hment is inflicted to prevent either the &s;ubject of the puni&s;hment, or others, from falling into the &s;ame practice. If there be no incon&s;i&s;tence in bringing &s;ickne&s;s on a man, and then healing him by medicine; where is the incon&s;i&s;tence in bringing &s;in, which is moral &s;ickne&s;s, on a man, and whereby both he and that &s;y&s;tem are &s;o far morally di&s;ea&s;ed, and then by puni&s;hment healing him or the &s;y&s;tem?</P>
<P N="2">2. There is no con&s;i&s;tence in the ca&s;e, if moral nece&s;&s;ity be incompatible with moral agency. But if it be entirely compatible with moral agency, there is no incon&s;i&s;tence in the ca&s;e: For in laying a man under a moral nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>&s;inning,</HI> as he is &s;uppo&s;ed &s;till to <HI>&s;in,</HI> nothing is done to impair his moral agency or his de&s;ert of puni&s;hment. On this &s;uppo&s;ition it is immaterial as to de&s;ert of puni&s;hment, who or what is the cau&s;e of the moral nece&s;&s;ity, whether God or any other being, or whether it happen without cau&s;e. Therefore God may as con&s;i&s;tently puni&s;h a &s;inner, whom he him&s;elf has laid under a moral nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning, as he may puni&s;h him, provided he be laid under the &s;ame moral nece&s;&s;ity by any other being, or by mere chance. If moral nece&s;&s;ity be entirely con&s;i&s;tent with de&s;ert of puni&s;hment, it is as imper|tinent to a&s;k how God can con&s;i&s;tently lay a man un|der a moral nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning and then puni&s;h him for it, as to a&s;k how God can con&s;i&s;tently make a man of a dark complexion or a low &s;tature and then pun|i&s;h him, for any &s;ins, which he may commit. For
<PB N="203" REF="032073_0201_0FF11199639A8080">
moral nece&s;&s;ity is no more incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;in and de&s;ert of puni&s;hment, than a dark complexion or a low &s;tature. To lay a man under a moral nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning, is to make it certain, that he will &s;in: And to a&s;k how God can con&s;i&s;tently make it certain, that he will &s;in, and then puni&s;h him for that &s;in, implies that previous certainty is incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;in, and that in order to &s;in a man mu&s;t act by mere chance.</P>
<P>It is no more incon&s;i&s;tent, for God to forbid men to &s;in, and yet &s;o di&s;po&s;e things, that they certainly will commit &s;in; than it is to forbid them to &s;in, and yet voluntarily to &s;uffer other cau&s;es to lead them into &s;in. Nay, &s;ince liberty is out of the que&s;tion, as by the very &s;tatement of the objection, it allows, that not|with&s;tanding the divine di&s;po&s;al, the man who is the &s;ubject of that di&s;po&s;al does commit <HI>&s;in;</HI> it is no more incon&s;i&s;tent for God to forbid men to &s;in, and yet &s;o di&s;po&s;e things, that &s;in will follow, than it is for him to forbid it, and yet voluntarily permit men to &s;in by &s;elf-determination. For in di&s;po&s;ing things &s;o that &s;in follows, when the di&s;po&s;al is &s;uppo&s;ed to be con&s;i&s;tent with &s;in and moral agency, nothing can be pretended to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the prohibition of &s;in, unle&s;s it be the divine con&s;ent, that &s;in &s;hould come into exi&s;tence; and this equally exi&s;ts in the ca&s;e of bare permi&s;&s;ion, as in the ca&s;e of the afore&s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. The law of God, which forbids all &s;in, does not imply, that God will prevent &s;in, by introducing the greater evil of de&s;troying moral agency. Nor does it imply, that he will not con&s;ent in his own mind, that it be committed by men or other moral agents, rather than the &s;aid greater evil or other as great evil &s;hould take place. Therefore rather than that the &s;ame or as great an evil &s;hould take place, the Deity may not only con&s;ent to the exi&s;t|ence of &s;in, but may con&s;ent, that &s;econd cau&s;es, mo|tives, temptations, &amp;c. &s;hould do whatever they can do, toward the introduction of it, con&s;i&s;tently with the freedom of the creature. He may do all this without
<PB N="204" REF="032073_0202_0FF111BA6B11D548">
incon&s;i&s;tence and in&s;incerity. The prohibition of &s;in in the law does not imply a wi&s;h or choice of the di|vine mind, all things con&s;idered, that &s;in &s;hould not be committed. It barely points out our duty, but reveals nothing of God's de&s;ign, whether or not to per|mit it, or to di&s;po&s;e things &s;o, that it will follow. Therefore there is no incon&s;i&s;tence between this pro|hibition and &s;uch a di&s;po&s;al in providence, as will be followed by &s;in.&mdash;A good ma&s;ter may &s;trictly for|bid his &s;ervant to &s;teal; yet convinced, that he does &s;teal, the ma&s;ter may in a particular ca&s;e, wi&s;h him to &s;teal, and even leave money expo&s;ed to him, that he may &s;teal, and ultimately with a de&s;ign that an advan|tage may be put into the ma&s;ter's hand, to convict, pun|i&s;h and reform his &s;ervant. There is no incon&s;i&s;tence in the ma&s;ter's thus forbidding theft, and yet from the motive before mentioned wi&s;hing to have it committed.</P>
<P N="7">(7) It is &s;aid, that if God choo&s;e that the &s;infulne&s;s of volitions &s;hould come into exi&s;tence, and if he &s;o di&s;po&s;e events, that it will certainly come into exi&s;t|ence; there is no difference between this, and God's being him&s;elf the &s;ubject of &s;inful volitions.&mdash;I an|&s;wer, there is the &s;ame difference in this ca&s;e, as there is between God's choo&s;ing that a man &s;hould be &s;ick, and being the &s;ubject of &s;ickne&s;s him&s;elf; as there is between creating matter, and being him&s;elf material; and as there is between willing and cau&s;ing the damna|tion of a &s;inner, and being him&s;elf the &s;ubject of dam|nation. It will not be pretended, that if God di&s;po&s;e events and circum&s;tances in &s;uch a manner, that re|pentance, godly &s;orrow, faith in a Redeemer, &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion and holy fear, take place in the heart of a man, God him&s;elf is the &s;ubject of tho&s;e exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>If, though human liberty be left entire, God can|not &s;o di&s;po&s;e things, that &s;in will certainly follow, without being him&s;elf the &s;ubject of a di&s;po&s;ition friendly to &s;in; he cannot without the &s;ame implica|tion choo&s;e, that &s;in &s;hould take place, rather than a greater evil. But our opponents allow, that God did

choo&s;e, that &s;in &s;hould take place, rather than a great|er evil; they allow, that he had a perfect foreknowl|edge, that if he &s;hould create man with a &s;elf-deter|mining power, and leave him to the free exerci&s;e of that power, the con&s;equence would be, that he would commit &s;in. Therefore they allow, that God cho&s;e, that &s;in &s;hould come into exi&s;tence, rather than hu|man liberty &s;hould be de&s;troyed, and rather than free agents &s;hould not be brought into exi&s;tence. So that in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, in which we hold, that God cho&s;e or was willing, that &s;in &s;hould come into exi&s;tence, our opponents hold the &s;ame. We hold, that God cho&s;e that &s;in &s;hould take place, rather than a greater evil; and therefore di&s;po&s;ed of events con&s;i&s;tently with human liberty, &s;o that it certainly followed. They hold, that God cho&s;e, that &s;in &s;hould take place, rather than a greater evil, and therefore di&s;po&s;ed of events, con&s;i&s;tently with human liberty, &s;o that it cer|cainly followed, and when God certainly fore&s;aw, that it would follow.</P>
<P>In that our opponents charge us with holding prin|ciples, which imply, that God is <HI>the author of &s;in,</HI> they allow, that whatever God does according to our prin|ciples toward the introduction of &s;in, is con&s;i&s;tent with free agency in the &s;ubject of &s;in. This mu&s;t be con|ceded by them; el&s;e their charge is perfectly incon|&s;i&s;tent and &s;elf-contradictory, as has been &s;hown. Therefore &s;ince it is allowed, that whatever God has done toward the exi&s;tence of &s;in, is con&s;i&s;tent with the creature's free agency, the only que&s;tion remain|ing, is, whether he have acted in this affair, with a holy and wi&s;e de&s;ign, a de&s;ign to promote the gener|al good: And we argue from the e&s;&s;ential perfections of God, that whatever he has done in this, as well as in every other in&s;tance, mu&s;t have been done with &s;uch a de&s;ign.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that &s;in cannot even by the Deity, be made &s;ub&s;ervient to good; the que&s;tion will ari&s;e, why then did he &s;o di&s;po&s;e circum&s;tances that it did
<PB N="206" REF="032073_0204_0FF111BC0FBE8C50">
come into exi&s;tence, and this when he fore&s;aw the con&s;equence? To an&s;wer, that he could not, con&s;i&s;t|ently with free agency, keep it out of exi&s;tence, is on the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition groundle&s;s. It is now &s;uppo&s;|ed, that God did bring it into exi&s;tence, con&s;i&s;tently with free agency; and therefore he could doubtle&s;s keep it out of exi&s;tence, con&s;i&s;tently with the &s;ame free agency.</P>
<P>If the exi&s;tence of &s;in be ultimately made &s;ub&s;ervi|ent to good, or if it be nece&s;&s;ary to the prevention of greater evil; what rea&s;on in the world, can be given, why God &s;hould not bring it into exi&s;tence, in a way con&s;i&s;tent with human free agency? In this way it mu&s;t be brought into exi&s;tence, if at all.&mdash;Our op|ponents them&s;elves allow, as has been ob&s;erved, that the exi&s;tence of it was nece&s;&s;ary to the prevention of greater evil, the evil of de&s;troying human liberty, or of the non-exi&s;tence of free agents: And for God in this view to con&s;ent to the exi&s;tence of &s;in, as our oppo|nents grant that he did, is as incon&s;i&s;tent with his moral character, as to give the &s;ame con&s;ent and to put forth any exertion toward its exi&s;tence, con&s;i&s;tent with human liberty. So long as the exertion is con|&s;i&s;tent with liberty, it cannot be pretended, that there is any thing in it more oppo&s;ite to the moral charac|ter of God or more friendly to &s;in, than there is in the con&s;ent implied in that permi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, which our opponents hold. Therefore their plan is in this re&s;pect equally liable to the &s;ame objection of being incon&s;i&s;tent with the moral character of God, as our's.</P>
<P N="8">(8) Dr. We&s;t argues, that if the Deity order things &s;o that &s;inful volition follow,
<Q>he mu&s;t place the ob|ject in &s;uch a view before the mind, as to make it appear the greate&s;t good under pre&s;ent circum&s;tan|ces; which implies, that he pre&s;ents the object in a fal&s;e point of light, and effectually deceives the mind;</Q>
and
<Q>the apo&s;tle was under a great mi&s;take, when he &s;aid, it was impo&s;&s;ible for God to lie; and to lie is &s;in.</Q>
The Doctor, as u&s;ual, tells us,
<Q>I
<PB N="207" REF="032073_0205_0FF111B4C2F9A860">
can have no idea, that the Deity can produce a &s;in|ful volition in the human mind, in any other way, than what I have now de&s;cribed; Part II, p. 41.</Q>
&mdash;On this I remark;</P>
<P N="1">1. It is very immaterial to others, what Dr. We&s;t can, and what he cannot, have an idea of. Does the Doctor mean this as an argument, that no other per|&s;on can have an idea of it, or that it cannot be true?</P>
<P N="2">2. If when he &s;peaks of God's making &s;in appear the greate&s;t good, he mean, that he makes it appear &s;o to a man's unbia&s;ed rea&s;on, this is not true, nor is it pretended by any man.</P>
<P N="3">3. When &s;in appears to any man the greate&s;t good, it is in con&s;equence of the influence of his cor|rupt appetites, and not by the dictates of his unbia&s;ed rea&s;on. How a man becomes the &s;ubject of corrupt appetite, I do not undertake to &s;ay any further than Pre&s;ident Edwards has &s;aid already, that God has di&s;|po&s;ed things &s;o, that it takes place as an infallible con&s;e|quence. But if God &s;o di&s;po&s;e things, that an inordi|nate appetite for &s;trong drink take place in the mind of a man, and by the influence of &s;uch appetite &s;trong drink appear to him the greate&s;t good; does it hence follow, that God is a liar? Will Dr. We&s;t a&s;&s;ert it? If not, the ground of his argument fails.</P>
<P>The Doctor further ob&s;erves, that
<Q>if God is the author of men's lu&s;ts, he deceives them, by cau&s;ing them to view things through the fal&s;e medium of their lu&s;ts; ibid, p. 42, 43.</Q>
&mdash;The expre&s;&s;ion, "God is the author of men's lu&s;ts," is the Doctor's, not Pre&s;ident Edwards's. It tends to mi&s;lead, and cannot be admitted, without explanation and qualifying. Suppo&s;e a man by leading his neighbour frequently into the immoderate u&s;e of &s;trong drink, &s;hould pro|duce an appetite for it in his neighbour, &s;o that hence|forward &s;trong drink &s;hould appear to him the greate&s;t good; is the man, who does this, a liar? Whether he be guilty of other &s;in, than lying, is nothing to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; for Dr. We&s;t's argument is, that
<PB N="208" REF="032073_0206_0FF111D82A69AA80">
God by producing lu&s;t in men, deceives the man in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, as to di&s;prove the words of the apo&s;tle, <HI>that God cannot lie.</HI> If the man above &s;uppo&s;ed be not guilty of lying, neither is the Deity in &s;o di&s;po&s;ing things, that lu&s;t infallibly follows.</P>
<P N="9">(9)
<Q>If the Deity be the po&s;itive efficient cau&s;e of &s;in, then there can be no foundation for repentance: For how can a man repent or be &s;orry, that he is ju&s;t &s;uch a creature, in every re&s;pect, as the Almighty has been plea&s;ed to make him?</Q>
Ibid, p. 44.&mdash;With the &s;ame objection to the expre&s;&s;ion, "po&s;itive efficient cau&s;e of <HI>&s;in,</HI>" I ob&s;erve, that this argument is equally good with re&s;pect to pain, &s;ickne&s;s and calamity; and will prove that no man ought to be &s;orry for any calamity befalling him&s;elf or others: For "how can a man be &s;orry, that he is ju&s;t &s;uch a creature," ju&s;t as mi&s;era|ble, "as God has made him?" If the Doctor &s;ay, that though calamity in it&s;elf is an evil and therefore to be regretted; yet as God &s;ends it, he will overrule it for good, and that in that view it is not to be regret|ted; the &s;ame ob&s;ervations are applicable to the ex|i&s;tence of &s;in. Sin in it&s;elf con&s;idered is infinitely vile and abominable, and proper matter of &s;orrow and repentance. But con&s;idering that it no more came into exi&s;tence without the de&s;ign and providence of God, than calamity did; and con&s;idering, that its ex|i&s;tence will be certainly overruled for final good; its exi&s;tence is no more to be regretted, than the exi&s;t|ence of calamity and mi&s;ery, e&s;pecially extreme and eternal mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The Doctor proceeds;
<Q>What remor&s;e of con|&s;cience can there be, when the &s;inner believes that every &s;inful volition was formed in him by the De|ity?</Q>
Ibid. Sinful volitions proceed from &s;ome cau&s;e, or no cau&s;e. If they proceed from no cau&s;e, what remor&s;e of con&s;cience can there be, when the &s;inner believes and knows, that every &s;inful volition happen|ed in him by pure chance? If &s;inful volitions pro|ceed from &s;ome cau&s;e, that cau&s;e is either the &s;inner
<PB N="209" REF="032073_0207_0FF111AE81E52738">
him&s;elf or &s;ome extrin&s;ic cau&s;e. If they proceed from any other extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, be&s;ide the Deity, the &s;ame difficulty will ari&s;e, and it may be a&s;ked with the &s;ame pertinency, as the above que&s;tion is a&s;ked by Dr. We&s;t, What remor&s;e of con&s;cience can there be, when the &s;inner believes, that every &s;inful volition was formed in him by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e? If the effi|cient cau&s;e be the &s;inner him&s;elf, then "&s;elf acts on &s;elf and produces volition," which the Doctor denies: And if he did not deny it, it is ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible, as it runs into an infinite &s;eries of volitions propagating one another, and yet all this &s;eries would really amount to but one &s;ingle volition, and this, as there would not then be a preceding cau&s;al volition, would not be efficient|ly, voluntarily and freely cau&s;ed by the &s;ubject him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; if the &s;ubject efficiently cau&s;e his own volitions, he either cau&s;es them under the influence of motives or not. If he cau&s;e them under the in|fluence of motives, he cau&s;es them nece&s;&s;arily, and acts nece&s;&s;arily in cau&s;ing them; and Dr. We&s;t &s;ays,
<Q>Where nece&s;&s;ity begins, liberty ends; ibid, p. 19.</Q>
There|fore if a man efficiently cau&s;e his own volitions &s;o as to be free from nece&s;&s;ity, he mu&s;t cau&s;e them with|out motive, aim or end; <HI>i. e.</HI> he mu&s;t cau&s;e them in perfect &s;tupidity, and in the exerci&s;e of Dr. We&s;t's torpid liberty of <HI>not acting.</HI> And then I a&s;k, what remor&s;e of con&s;cience can there be, when the &s;inner believes, that he him&s;elf cau&s;ed every &s;inful volition in him&s;elf, as involuntarily as a man in a convul&s;ion &s;trikes his friend, and as &s;tupidly and unmeaningly as a door turns on its hinges?</P>
<P>Remor&s;e of con&s;cience is a &s;en&s;e of having done wrong; and whenever a per&s;on has done wrong, there is a foundation for remor&s;e of con&s;cience; and to take it for granted, that there can be no remor&s;e of con&s;cience, unle&s;s we determine our own volitions, is to take it for granted, that without &s;elf-determination we can do no wrong and are no moral agents; which is to beg the main que&s;tion in this controver&s;y. Let it
<PB N="210" REF="032073_0208_0FF111A341B4A540">
be &s;hown, that without &s;elf-determination, we are not moral agents, and one important &s;tep will be taken toward &s;ettling this controver&s;y. Yet even this &s;tep will not be deci&s;ive: It mu&s;t be al&s;o &s;hown, that our &s;elf-determination was not previou&s;ly certain, but is exerci&s;ed by mere chance: For if it be previou&s;ly certain, it is morally nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="10">(10) If God have &s;o di&s;po&s;ed of events, that &s;in certainly follows, it is his work; and to be oppo&s;ed to &s;in is "to be oppo&s;ed to God's work, and to be op|po&s;ed to God;" ibid.&mdash;So calamity is the work of God, and to be oppo&s;ed to that, is to be oppo&s;ed to God's work, and to be oppo&s;ed to God.

&mdash;The difficulty attend|ing mo&s;t of Dr. We&s;t's arguments, is, that if they prove any thing, they prove too much, and confute principles and facts, which he will not dare to deny.

<Q>on a man, becau&s;e his glory could not be promoted without them; then &s;urely the &s;inner, if he loves God, mu&s;t love him, becau&s;e he has made him a mi&s;erable "creature, and ought to thank him for all" the calamity and mi&s;ery, which he &s;uffers, for all his &s;ickne&s;s and dangers, for the death of his wife, chil|dren, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> And if a man ought to thank God for the&s;e things, no doubt,
<Q>a &s;inner ought to thank God for damnation.</Q>
If the&s;e con&s;equences do not in|evitably follow from the principle of Dr. We&s;t's ar|gument, let the contrary be &s;hown, and not merely a&s;&s;erted.&mdash;Again; "If we are to thank God for
<PB N="211" REF="032073_0209_0FF111BE6375BA70">
all the calamities and mi&s;eries which we do or &s;hall &s;uffer; "this will imply, that" calamity and mi&s;ery
<Q>are ble&s;&s;ings or favours; and con&s;equently, if the &s;inner is to thank God for damnation, then damna|tion is a ble&s;&s;ing and favour&mdash;Hence &s;inners who believe this doctrine, will be apt to conclude, that it is a matter of no con&s;equence, whether they be &s;aved or damned; &s;eeing upon either &s;uppo&s;ition, they are &s;ure that whatever they receive from God will be &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing, that they ought to be thank|ful for it.</Q>
Ibid, p. 45.&mdash;Thus may the Doctor's arguments be retorted again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>If the Doctor &s;hould an&s;wer, Though calamity and mi&s;ery in them&s;elves are no ble&s;&s;ings, yet when they are overruled by God to the good of tho&s;e who &s;uffer them, or to the general good, they become ble&s;&s;ings; I acknowledge the &s;ufficiency of the an&s;wer. But the &s;ame an&s;wer may with equal truth and force be made to his ob&s;ervations concerning &s;in. The Doc|tor grants, that the wickedne&s;s of the vicious &s;hall be overruled to the glory of God and the advancement of the happine&s;s of the righteous; ibid, p. 19. Though wickedne&s;s is in it&s;elf no ble&s;&s;ing and no matter of thankfulne&s;s; yet when God overrules it to good, greater good than could have been effected in any other way; in this connection it is in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e a ble&s;&s;ing, and matter of thankfulne&s;s, as calamity and mi&s;ery are.</P>
<P N="12">(12) On the plan of moral nece&s;&s;ity, God tempts mankind to &s;in.&mdash;If the meaning of this be, that God e&s;tabli&s;hes a connection between motives and volitions, and a previous certainty of tho&s;e volitions; and in the cour&s;e of his providence brings into the view of men motives which actually influence them to &s;in; I grant, that God does in this &s;en&s;e tempt mankind to &s;in; as he did our fir&s;t parents, Judas, &amp;c. Nor is there any ground, on which this can be denied, unle&s;s it be allowed, that this previous cer|tainty is e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;ome other cau&s;e than the De|ity, or that it exi&s;ts without cau&s;e, or that volitions
<PB N="212" REF="032073_0210_0FF111AA7A584B68">
are not previou&s;ly certain, but happen by chance. To hold that the previous certainty of all volitions is e&s;|tabli&s;hed by &s;ome other cau&s;e than God, is to run in|to the Manichean &s;cheme of two Gods, and at the &s;ame time to hold, that the &s;econd God is an involun|tary agent and is the cau&s;e of all the volitions of the voluntary God, as well as of all creatures. If we &s;ay, this previous certainty of all volitions is uncau&s;ed, we may as well &s;ay, that every thing el&s;e is uncau&s;ed. If we &s;ay, that volitions are not previou&s;ly certain, but happen by mere chance, we may as well &s;ay, that every thing el&s;e happens by chance.</P>
<P>But if by <HI>tempting</HI> be meant &s;oliciting or enticing to &s;in, as the devil tempts men, we deny that this is implied in our doctrine.</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t makes &s;ome remarks, Part II, p. 75, &amp;c. on Jam. i.13&mdash;16, which appear to be remarka|ble.&mdash;1. He tells us, that
<Q>a man is tempted, when he con&s;ents to the gratification of his own lu&s;t; <HI>i. e.</HI> when he commits &s;in.</Q>
Indeed! Is no man tempt|ed, but he who actually commits &s;in in con&s;equence of the temptation? The apo&s;tle Paul declares, Acts xx.19, that he
<Q>&s;erved the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears and <HI>temptations,</HI> which befel him by the lying in wait of the Jews.</Q>
And were all the&s;e temptations &s;ucce&s;sful with the apo&s;tle? The very text implies the contrary. Gal. iv.14.
<Q>And my temptation, which was in my fle&s;h, ye de&s;|pi&s;ed not nor rejected, but received me as an angel of God, even as Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q>
Jam. i.2.
<Q>Count if all joy, when ye fall into divers temptations.</Q>
V. 12. "Ble&s;&s;ed is the man, that endureth temptation: For when he is tried, he &s;hall receive the crown of life."</P>
<P>Or if Dr. We&s;t &s;hall allow, that a man is or may be tempted without falling into &s;in, this will &s;poil his ar|gument. His words immediately following tho&s;e la&s;t quoted from him, are, <Q>This proves, that when it is &s;aid, neither tempteth he any man, the &s;en&s;e is, God cau&s;eth no man to &s;in.</Q> But if a man may be
<PB N="113" REF="032073_0211_0FF111C009DAFEB8">
tempted without committing &s;in, then God may tempt a man, without cau&s;ing him to &s;in.</P>
<P N="2">2. He ob&s;erves from <HI>Leigh,</HI> that the Greek verb <GAP DESC="foreign">, u&s;ed in the pa&s;&s;age in James now under con|&s;ideration, &s;ignifies to <HI>make trial, i. e. to try</HI> a per&s;on. But becau&s;e James &s;ays of God, <HI>neither tempteth he any man,</HI> will Dr. We&s;t adventure to &s;ay, that God never <HI>tries</HI> any man? and particularly that he did not try Abraham?</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e this text declares, that God does not <HI>tempt, i. e.</HI> according to the Doctor's explanation, <HI>try</HI> any man, he infers that God
<Q>does not cau&s;e them to &s;in.</Q>
This con&s;equence follows not from the prin|ciple premi&s;ed. Whether God do or do not, try men, he may &s;o di&s;po&s;e things that &s;in will be the cer|tain con&s;equence; and this may be done not to <HI>try</HI> any man.</P>
<P N="4">4. He &s;ays, that
<Q>a voluntary con&s;ent to indulge or gratify lu&s;t, is &s;in.</Q>
Yet in the next &s;entence he &s;ays,
<Q>the apo&s;tle makes every &s;in to be the <HI>effect</HI> of a con&s;ent to gratify &s;ome particular lu&s;t: <HI>i. e.</HI> eve|ry &s;in is the effect of &s;in.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5. The whole force of this text, to prove, that God does not di&s;po&s;e things &s;o, that &s;in is the certain con&s;equence, if it prove any thing to this effect, lies in the&s;e words, "Neither tempteth he any man." The Doctor &s;ays,
<Q>the&s;e mu&s;t mean, Neither cau&s;eth he any man to &s;in; ibid, p. 75.</Q>
&mdash;But if
<Q>the Deity infallibly and perfectly regulate, govern and &s;et bounds to the actions of all rational creatures, and overrule all tho&s;e actions to accompli&s;h his pur|po&s;es, if he <HI>make</HI> them perform his purpo&s;es infal|libly; as Dr. We&s;t &s;ays; then every thing which they in fact do, and every &s;in which they commit, was God's purpo&s;e and he <HI>makes</HI> them perform it.</Q>
Is he then in no &s;en&s;e the cau&s;e of their &s;in? Does he not at lea&s;t &s;o di&s;po&s;e things, that &s;in is the certain con&s;equence?</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t abundantly a&s;&s;erts tho&s;e things which nece&s;&s;arily imply both ab&s;olute decrees and &s;uch di&s;|po&s;al
<PB N="214" REF="032073_0212_0FF111D9C6B091F8">
of God, that &s;in certainly and infallibly follows. "The creature," &s;ays he,
<Q>in every moment of its exi&s;tence, is &s;ubject to the divine <HI>control;</HI> con&s;e|quently <HI>no act can take place,</HI> but what the Deity fore&s;aw and <HI>determined</HI> from all eternity to <HI>overrule</HI> to his own glory and the general good. If the Dei|ty fore&s;aw, that a creature &mdash; would do that which could not be overruled to the divine glory and the general good &mdash; he would <HI>re&s;train</HI> him from doing that; Part II, p. 22.</Q>
<Q>He who has made all things &mdash; does <HI>regulate</HI> and <HI>govern</HI> all things, and <HI>&s;ets bounds to the actions of all ration|al creatures.</HI>&mdash;The Deity, by his permi&s;&s;ive de|cree, <HI>&s;uperintends</HI> and <HI>governs all the actions</HI> of his creatures to accompli&s;h <HI>his own purpo&s;es, in as &s;trong a &s;en&s;e, as though he brought them to pa&s;s by his po&s;|itive efficiency;</HI> ibid, p. 46.</Q>
<Q>We believe, that the Deity <HI>governs</HI> and overrules the actions of the&s;e beings [rational creatures] to bring about his own purpo&s;es and de&s;igns <HI>as infallibly,</HI> &mdash; as though they were <HI>mere pa&s;&s;ive</HI> beings; ibid, p. 47.</Q></P>
<P>Now if the&s;e things be &s;o; no act of the creature <HI>can</HI> take place, but what God determined from all e|ternity, to overrule to his own glory. If God <HI>re|&s;train</HI> the creature from the contrary; if he <HI>overrule</HI> all tho&s;e actions to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;es, in as &s;trong a &s;en&s;e, as though he brought them to pa&s;s by his po&s;itive efficiency, and as infallibly as though they were mere pa&s;&s;ive beings; then certainly he does di&s;po&s;e things &s;o, that all tho&s;e actions do infallibly take place. To be &s;ubject to the <HI>control</HI> of our Creator in every moment of our exi&s;tence, &s;o that no act <HI>can</HI> take place in us, but what God from eternity <HI>deter|mined</HI>; to be <HI>regulated</HI> and <HI>governed</HI> by God in <HI>all things</HI>; if he &s;et bounds to <HI>all</HI> our actions; and if he <HI>govern</HI> and <HI>overrule</HI> all our actions in as &s;trong a &s;en&s;e as if he brought them to pa&s;s by his <HI>po&s;itive efficiency,</HI> and as <HI>infallibly</HI> as though they were mere <HI>pa&s;&s;ive beings;</HI> &s;urely all this implies, that God does &s;o di&s;po&s;e of e|vents,
<PB N="215" REF="032073_0213_0FF1119BE28D2B48">
that &s;in certainly follows. And on this plan, where is &s;elf-determination? Where is liberty to ei|ther &s;ide? liberty to act or not act? All the actions of rational creatures are limited, bounded and re&s;trained to certain definite objects and purpo&s;es, which God, from eternity had in view. They are therefore &s;hut up to act one way only, and cannot act otherwi&s;e. They can act in &s;uch a manner only, as God from all eternity &s;aw would accompli&s;h his glorious purpo&s;es, <HI>i. e.</HI> his glorious <HI>decrees.</HI> Therefore all the actions of crea|tures are decreed from eternity to be preci&s;ely what they are, and all creatures are as infallibly re&s;trained from acting contrary to the decrees of God, as if he brought their actions to pa&s;s by his po&s;itive efficiency, and as though they were mere pa&s;&s;ive beings.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that though God bounds and re&s;trains his creatures from acting in a manner which is oppo&s;ite to his purpo&s;es and decrees; yet he does not nece&s;&s;itate them to act at all, but leaves them at liberty to act or not act:&mdash;On this I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. As I have already &s;aid, whenever any thing is propo&s;ed to any intelligent being, as the object of his choice, it is, as Mr. Locke has long &s;ince thought, ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for that being not to act. He may indeed either choo&s;e or refu&s;e the object. But to refu&s;e it is to act, equally as to choo&s;e it. In ei|ther ca&s;e the being acts and cannot avoid acting, un|le&s;s he be &s;unk into a &s;tate of perfect unfeeling &s;tu|pidity.</P>
<P N="2">2. If it were po&s;&s;ible for a creature to act or not act; &s;till according to Dr. We&s;t he could do neither the one nor the other, unle&s;s it were &s;ub&s;ervient to the glorious purpo&s;es of God. For if God will in|fallibly re&s;train creatures from acting in all in&s;tances, in which their acting is not &s;ub&s;ervient to his pur|po&s;es; will he not re&s;train them from <HI>not acting, i. e.</HI> prevent their &s;inking into unfeeling &s;tupidity, and ex|cite them to action, in all in&s;tances in which not act|ing would not in like manner be &s;ub&s;ervient to his
<PB N="216" REF="032073_0214_0FF0D3BAC4EEB200">
purpo&s;es? If not, let a rea&s;on be given; a rea&s;on why God will not prevent creatures from counteract|ing his purpo&s;es by <HI>not acting,</HI> as well as by <HI>acting.</HI> Surely it will not be pretended, that to excite by ra|tional motives and con&s;iderations, a creature to ac|tion, is more incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty, than infallibly to re&s;train, whether by motives or without motives, the &s;ame creature from action.</P>
<P N="3">3. I appeal to the reader, whether the Doctor have not in the pa&s;&s;ages above quoted, given up the whole que&s;tion both with re&s;pect to liberty as oppo&s;ed to infallible moral nece&s;&s;ity or certainty of moral action, and with re&s;pect to ab&s;olute decrees. If all men be limited and bounded by God, to act in all ca&s;es according to his purpo&s;es; if they be &s;hut up to this way of acting, and cannot voluntarily refu&s;e to act in this way, as that would be to act contrary to God's purpo&s;e; if they cannot ab&s;olutely cea&s;e from all action when an object is propo&s;ed to their choice, but mu&s;t either choo&s;e or refu&s;e, and that according to God's purpo&s;e; if, as Doctor We&s;t expre&s;sly declares to be according to his &s;entiments,
<Q>Every thing is as firmly fixed in the divine mind, by his permi&s;&s;ive decree, and &s;hall be as infallibly accompli&s;hed, as though he was the im|mediate author or efficient cau&s;e of all the actions of creatures; ibid, p. 49.</Q>
Let the candid reader judge, whether the Doctor do not grant both ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity and ab&s;olute decrees.</P>
<P>He as we have &s;een in his Part II, p. 22, allows, that God permits and overrules &s;in to his own glory and the general good; but thinks this a demon|&s;trative proof of &s;elf-determination. Let us con&s;ider what he &s;ays on this &s;ubject.&mdash;Ibid, p. 34;
<Q>If the doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity be true, and we are not &s;elf-determined, then it will follow, that we are con&s;tant|ly determined by the po&s;itive efficiency of the Deity.</Q>
If it be true, as the Doctor holds, that God <HI>regulates</HI>
<Q>and <HI>governs</HI> all things, and <HI>&s;ets bounds</HI> to the actions of <HI>all</HI> rational creatures, to bring about <HI>infallibly</HI>
<PB N="217" REF="032073_0215_0FF111C56C967D60">
his own purpo&s;es;</Q>
if he
<Q>govern <HI>free agents</HI> as perfectly <HI>and</HI> make them perform <HI>his purpo&s;es as in|fallibly,</HI> as if they had no agency at all; I leave the reader to judge, whether we, in all our actions, be not, mediately or immediately, determined by the po&s;i|tive efficiency of the Deity.</Q>
"If God make them perform his purpo&s;es <HI>infallibly,</HI>" it &s;eems he mu&s;t by his po&s;itive efficiency determine them to the perform|ance; for what is it <HI>to make</HI> men perform a purpo&s;e, but to put forth po&s;itive exertions to this end? This is al&s;o by po&s;itive efficiency to aboli&s;h all liberty of &s;elf-determination.&mdash;If the&s;e things be denied, and it be affirmed, that &s;till the man is at liberty to act in that particular manner, which is &s;ub&s;ervient to the di|vine purpo&s;e, or not to act at all, and thus there is room for &s;elf-determination; I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is not allowed, that a man on a propo&s;al to act, can po&s;&s;ibly <HI>not act at all;</HI> and this ought not to be taken for granted.</P>
<P N="2">2. Then God does not infallibly make men com|ply with his purpo&s;e, but leaves them to comply or not; which is directly contrary to Dr. We&s;t him&s;elf, in the quotations made above.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the Deity by his po&s;itive efficiency prevent his creature from every action, but that which is agreeable to his purpo&s;e, he will prevent him by his po&s;itive efficiency from refu&s;ing to comply with that purpo&s;e, and this is by po&s;itive efficiency to deter|mine him to comply with that purpo&s;e. And the Doctor grants, that all the actions of rational creatures are agreeable to God's purpo&s;es. Therefore all ra|tional creatures in all their actions are determined by the po&s;itive efficiency of God. And all tho&s;e which Dr. Samuel We&s;t mentions as ab&s;urd con&s;equences of the &s;entiments of Dr. Stephen We&s;t, may be retorted on the former, thus; Since God infallibly <HI>makes</HI> and determines all men to perform his purpo&s;es, in all their actions,
<Q>&s;in is as much the work of God, as any thing that he has made. But that the Deity
<PB N="218" REF="032073_0216_0FF111C6F58B13B8">
&s;hould have an infinite aver&s;ion and an immutable hatred to his works, is inconceivable. It is &s;ome|times &s;aid, that the tendency of &s;in is to dethrone the Almighty, to kill and utterly to de&s;troy his ex|i&s;tence. But is the Deity con&s;tantly working to de&s;troy him&s;elf? This will make the Deity a &s;trange contradiction to him&s;elf, and will con&s;titute &s;uch a be|ing, as cannot exi&s;t in the univer&s;e. If the Deity forms wicked volitions in the human mind, and then infinitely hates and abhors tho&s;e very works of his, he mu&s;t be infinitely mi&s;erable and wretched. God is &s;aid to rejoice in his own works&mdash;If then &s;in is God's work he rejoices in it&mdash;God is the greate&s;t lover of &s;in in the univer&s;e.</Q>
Whatever ab&s;urdities the&s;e be, it concerns Dr. Samuel We&s;t, as much as any man, to remove them. As appears, it is pre&s;umed, by what has been &s;aid already.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; mo&s;t or all the&s;e objections lie with equal force again&s;t the divine efficiency of pain, mi&s;ery or death. The Doctor will not deny, that the&s;e are in|flicted by God. Therefore mi&s;ery and death
<Q>are as much the works of God, as any that he has made.</Q>
Yet
<Q>he does not willingly afflict and grieve the children of men.</Q>
And
<Q>he has no plea&s;ure in the death of even "the wicked."</Q>
Therefore
<Q>God has an in|finite aver&s;ion and an irreconcilable hatred to his own works:</Q>
And if this be inconceivable to Dr. We&s;t he will not deny it to be fact; and therefore that a thing is inconceivable to him, is no proof, that it is not true. And that the Deity &s;hould hate mi&s;ery and death and yet cau&s;e them, would equally as in the ca&s;e &s;tated by Dr. We&s;t concerning the introduction of &s;in,
<Q>make the Deity a &s;trange contradiction to him&s;elf, and would con&s;titute &s;uch a being as can|not exi&s;t in the univer&s;e.</Q>
"If the Deity forms" mi&s;ery and death,
<Q>and then infinitely hates and ab|hors the&s;e very works of his hands, he mu&s;t be in|finitely mi&s;erable and wretched. God is &s;aid to re|joice in his own works. If then</Q>
mi&s;ery and death
<PB N="219" REF="032073_0217_0FF111C8A42D4E88">
<Q>be his works, he rejoices in them, and God is the greate&s;t lover</Q>
of all the mi&s;ery and death
<Q>in the univer&s;e.</Q>
Whenever Dr. We&s;t will an&s;wer the&s;e ob&s;ervations concerning the divine efficiency of mi&s;|ery and death, he will furni&s;h him&s;elf with an an&s;wer to his own &s;imilar ob&s;ervations concerning the divine agency in the introduction of moral evil. If he &s;hall &s;ay, that God does indeed hate mi&s;ery and death in them&s;elves con&s;idered, and inflicts them, becau&s;e they are nece&s;&s;ary to greater good, and to the ac|compli&s;hment of his own mo&s;t benevolent purpo&s;es; the &s;ame may be &s;aid concerning moral evil.</P>
<P>The Doctor quotes the following pa&s;&s;age from Dr. Hopkins;
<Q>If God be the origin or cau&s;e of moral evil this is &s;o far from imputing moral evil to him, or &s;uppo&s;ing, that there is any thing of moral evil in him, that it nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es the contrary:</Q>
On which he remarks,
<Q>Con&s;equently, if God be the or|igin and cau&s;e of holine&s;s, this by the &s;ame kind of rea&s;oning, is &s;o far from imputing holine&s;s to him, or &s;uppo&s;ing, that there is any thing of that nature in him, that it nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es the contrary; that is to &s;ay, that the Deity has no moral character at all.</Q>
In the above quotation, Dr. Hopkins evi|dently means, If God be the cau&s;e of <HI>all</HI> moral evil, or of the fir&s;t which exi&s;ted in the univer&s;e. This the word <HI>origin</HI> implies; he evidently u&s;es it to mean <HI>orig|inal</HI> cau&s;e. Now whatever is in God, is uncau&s;ed. Therefore if there be moral evil in him, neither be nor any other being is the cau&s;e of that; of cour&s;e whatever moral evil he cau&s;es, mu&s;t all be out of him|&s;elf; and if he cau&s;e all moral evil, it mu&s;t all be out of him&s;elf and none of it in him. So that Dr. Hop|kins's propo&s;ition on this head is manife&s;tly true. Suppo&s;e the Doctor had &s;aid, If God be the cau&s;e of all matter, this &s;o far from &s;uppo&s;ing matter in him&punc; ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es the contrary; no doubt Dr. We&s;t him&s;elf would have acknowledged the truth of the propo&s;ition: And let a rea&s;on be given why the form|er
<PB N="220" REF="032073_0218_0FF111B76E644FF0">
propo&s;ition, in the &s;en&s;e now given of it, is not as true as the latter. As to the con&s;equence which Dr. We&s;t draws from Dr. Hopkins's propo&s;ition,
<Q>that if God be the cau&s;e of holine&s;s [of <HI>all</HI> holine&s;s] this is &s;o far from &s;uppo&s;ing holine&s;s in God, that it ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es the contrary; this is &s;o far from an ab&s;urdity, as Dr. We&s;t imagines, that it is a man|fe&s;t truth.</Q>
Holine&s;s in God is no more cau&s;ed or created, than the divine e&s;&s;ence. If then there be no other holine&s;s, than created holine&s;s, there is and can be none in God.</P>
<P>On a pa&s;&s;age in which Dr. Hopkins a&s;&s;erts, that moral evil and holine&s;s are equally the con&s;equence of the divine di&s;po&s;al, but whether by the &s;ame mode of operation he could not tell; Dr. We&s;t remarks,
<Q>This makes it extremely unhappy for us; for we &s;eem to have no way to know a true revelation from a fal&s;e one, both equally coming from the De|ity; p. 46, Part II.</Q>
But how this con&s;equence fol|lows from the a&s;&s;ertion of Dr. Hopkins, Dr. We&s;t does not illu&s;trate. God may &s;o di&s;po&s;e things, that &s;in in|fallibly follows, and yet not be the author of a fal&s;e revelation: And as the Doctor merely a&s;&s;erts, with|out attempting to prove what he a&s;&s;erts, he has no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight to expect, that his a&s;&s;ertion &s;hould be received as truth. If the Doctor take it for granted, that if God, in the way which I have explained, introduce &s;in, he is him&s;elf as real a &s;inner, as he would be, if he were to give a fal&s;e revelation, he takes for grant|ed the very thing in que&s;tion, which is to be fairly proved, not pitifully begged.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame page, he &s;ays,
<Q>According to Dr. Hopkins will it not follow, that many who are led by the Spirit of God, are the children of the devil?</Q>
This implies, that whenever God, by means of mo|tives or in any other way, &s;o di&s;po&s;es of things, that &s;in infallibly follows, the man who is the &s;ubject of that &s;in, is in that &s;in led by the Spirit of God. The principle on which this argument is built, is,
<PB N="221" REF="032073_0219_0FF111A50A1471C0">
that whenever God &s;o di&s;po&s;es things, that an action is the certain con&s;equence, in that action the man is led by the Spirit of God. But Dr. We&s;t will not a|vow and abide by this principle: For he grants, that men always act upon &s;ome motive and never without motive. Nor will he deny, that the con&s;titution, that men &s;hould always act upon motive and never with|out, is e&s;tabli&s;hed by God. Yea, the Doctor expre&s;s|ly a&s;&s;erts, that
<Q>God overrules <HI>all the actions of his creatures</HI> to accompli&s;h his own purpo&s;es in as &s;trong a &s;en&s;e as though he brought them to pa&s;s by his <HI>po&s;itive efficiency.</HI></Q>
Yet he will not pretend, that in all tho&s;e actions they are led by the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>The Doctor proceeds;
<Q>The Deity is called the Father of lights, from whom proceeds every good and perfect gift. But according to the&s;e principles, may he not, with as much propriety, be called the Father of darkne&s;s, from whom proceeds all ma|lignity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wickedne&s;s?</Q>
Since the Doctor holds, that
<Q>The Deity governs free agents as perfectly and <HI>makes</HI> them perform his purpo&s;e as infallibly, as if they had no agency at all; the que&s;tion which the Doctor here propo&s;es concerning the principles of Dr. Hopkins may with equal propriety be propo&s;ed on his own principles.</Q>
And notwith&s;tanding any agency which God exerci&s;es toward the production of moral evil, he may with the &s;ame truth and propriety be called <HI>the Father of lights,</HI> as he is called <HI>the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort,</HI> although all the pains and mi&s;eries, which his creatures &s;uffer, whether in this world or the future, are inflicted by him.</P>
<P>The Doctor &s;eems to attempt to &s;creen him&s;elf from tho&s;e, which he &s;uppo&s;es to be ab&s;urd con&s;e|quences of Dr. Hopkins's &s;cheme, by repre&s;enting, that he holds, that God barely <HI>permits &s;in.</HI> But to <HI>&s;uperintend, govern</HI> and <HI>overrule</HI> the actions of ration|al creatures
<Q>as infallibly, as if they were mere pa&s;|&s;ive beings;</Q>

Barely to permit them to act of them&s;elves, by which the Doctor explains him&s;elf to mean,
<Q>ordaining things contingently, <HI>i. e.</HI> avoidably, and with a po&s;&s;i|bility of not coming to pa&s;s, ibid, p. 47; is not to govern them at all, but to leave them to govern them|&s;elves; it is not to overrule their actions, but to leave them to overrule their own actions; it is not to <HI>make</HI> them perform his purpo&s;es, but to leave them loo&s;e to perform or to omit tho&s;e purpo&s;es.</Q>
And much le&s;s is it to govern and overrule their actions <HI>as infallibly as if they were mere pa&s;&s;ive beings, and in as &s;trong a &s;en&s;e as though he brought them to pa&s;s by his po&s;itive ef|ficiency;</HI> to <HI>fix</HI> tho&s;e actions as <HI>infallibly as though he was the immediate author of them;</HI> or to <HI>govern</HI> them as <HI>perfectly</HI> and to <HI>make</HI> them perform his purpo&s;es <HI>as infallibly, as though they had no agency at all.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t con&s;tantly in&s;i&s;ts, that
<Q>the Deity has communicated to man a &s;elf-moving or &s;elf-active principle.</Q>
But what kind of a &s;elf-moving prin|ciple is that, which is always and in all its actions in|fallibly and perfectly regulated, governed and over|ruled by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e? and which is made by God as infallibly to perform his purpo&s;es, as if it were no &s;elf-moving principle at all? Such a &s;elf-moving principle as this, is &s;o like a principle that never moves it&s;elf, but is always moved by an extrin&s;ic cau&s;e, that I reque&s;t Dr. We&s;t to point out the difference.</P>
<P>The Doctor grants, that
<Q>there is a &s;en&s;e in which God <HI>hardens</HI> the hearts of men,</Q>
and that this is by his
<Q>taking from <HI>them</HI> what he had granted them, as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment of their neglect and abu&s;e of the advantages which they enjoyed; Part II, p. 52.</Q>
He
<PB N="223" REF="032073_0221_0FF111DB55BB7DE8">
grants therefore, that God may con&s;i&s;tently with his holine&s;s harden the heart, and cau&s;e &s;in in men, in &s;ome ca&s;es; viz. when they de&s;erve it as a ju&s;t pun|i&s;hment of their &s;in. But the only rea&s;on, which renders it con&s;i&s;tent with the divine perfections, to in|flict this or any other ju&s;t puni&s;hment, is, that the glo|ry of God and the general good of his kingdom re+quire it. Now no one pretends, that God ever in any &s;en&s;e cau&s;es &s;in to take place, unle&s;s its exi&s;t|ence be &s;ub&s;ervient to the glory of God and the good of his kingdom. And if this rea&s;on will in one ca&s;e ju&s;tify his &s;o di&s;po&s;ing of things, that &s;in is the infalli|ble con&s;equence, why not in another? Until a rea&s;on is given to the contrary, we may pre&s;ume, that when|ever the glory of God and the general good of the crea|tion require it, God may and does &s;o di&s;po&s;e things, that &s;in is the infallible con&s;equence.</P>
<P><Q>A man's becoming a ve&s;&s;el to honour or di&s;hon|our, is in con&s;equence of his own conduct and be|haviour.</Q>
Part II, p. 54. If by becoming a ve&s;|&s;el to di&s;honour the Doctor mean, <HI>being puni&s;hed,</HI> no doubt it is in con&s;equence of a man's own mi&s;conduct, and to a&s;&s;ert this is to a&s;&s;ert nothing very great or pertinent to the que&s;tion concerning the cau&s;e of &s;in. But if he mean by it committing &s;in; this is not, nor can be always in con&s;equence of the &s;inner's own mi&s;|conduct; becau&s;e this like the &s;elf-determining power, implies the ab&s;urdity of an infinite &s;eries of actions, in con&s;equnce of each other; and that a man is doomed to commit &s;in in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, in con&s;equence of a prior &s;in committed by him.</P>
<P><Q>God does not harden the hearts of men, by any po&s;itive efficiency in forming or infu&s;ing any wick|edne&s;s into their heart, but only taking from them tho&s;e things, which were de&s;igned to re&s;train them from the committing of &s;in, and by permitting them to walk in their own wicked ways; ibid, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">5.</Q>
Of all men Dr. We&s;t &s;o long as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olds&punc; that God as perfectly and infallibly regulates, governs and over|rules

all the actions of free agents, and makes them conform to his purpo&s;es, as perfectly as if they had no agency at all, &s;hould be the la&s;t to object to the idea of God's po&s;itive efficiency of &s;in; as has been already illu&s;trated. But a&s;ide from this, if God by taking from men what is nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train them from &s;in, lay them under an infallible certainty or ab|&s;olute moral nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning; what advantage is gained by this mode of repre&s;enting the matter? Is it at all more favourable either to the liberty of men, or to the holine&s;s of God? To be &s;ure this repre&s;enta|tion implies all that nece&s;&s;ity, for which Pre&s;ident Ed|wards pleads in the ca&s;e. It is &s;o to di&s;po&s;e things, that &s;in is the infallible con&s;equence. Or if this tak|ing away of re&s;traints be attended with no certain con&s;e|quence of &s;in, how does God by it harden the &s;in|ner? It &s;eems, that after all he is left in a &s;tate of un|certainty, <HI>i. e.</HI> Dr. We&s;t's perfect liberty, whether he will &s;in or not. Where then is hardne&s;s of heart? Does it con&s;i&s;t in perfect liberty? It is further to be ob&s;erved, that if &s;in, for in&s;tance, an act of malice, envy or inordinate &s;elf-love, &s;hould come into exi&s;tence, without any po&s;|itive cau&s;ation, whether by motive or in &s;ome other way; why may not any other po&s;itive thing, either &s;ub&s;tance or mode, and even the whole material uni|ver&s;e, come into exi&s;tence in the &s;ame way?</P>
<P>Dr. We&s;t remarks on I&s;ai. lxiii.17. <HI>O Lord, why ha&s;t thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our hearts from thy fear?</HI>
<Q>Now it is certain from the texts that have been already examined, that nothing more is intended, than that God leaves men to err, and to harden their own hearts; ibid, p. 51.</Q>
This po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion led me to review the Doctor's remarks on tho&s;e texts, and I am very willing the candid &s;hould judge concerning the Doctor's ex|hibition of certainty, that nothing more is intended, by God's hardening the hearts of men, than that God leaves them to harden their own hearts. He &s;ays, p. 52, in what &s;en&s;e God hardens the heart, our Saviour
<PB N="225" REF="032073_0223_0FF1119789CB81E0">
will inform us, Mat. xiii.14, 15.
<Q>This people's heart is waxed gro&s;s, and their ears are dull of hear|ing, and their eyes <HI>they</HI> have clo&s;ed.</Q>
In an&s;wer to this it may be &s;aid with equal force, In what &s;en&s;e God hardens the heart, we are informed in Joh. xii.40.
<Q><HI>He</HI> hath blinded their minds, and hardened their hearts, that they &s;hould not &s;ee with their eyes, &amp;c.</Q>
Whatever right the Doctor has to &s;uppo&s;e, and without a rea&s;on to deliver the <HI>opinion</HI> as truth, that Joh. xii.40, is to be explained by Mat. xiii.15; any other per&s;on has the &s;ame right to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> and to deliver the opinion as truth, that Mat. xiii.15, is to be ex|plained by Joh. xii.40.</P>
<P>The Doctor con&s;tantly in&s;i&s;ts, that
<Q>God never hard|ens any man or withdraws his &s;pirit and grace, ibid, p. 52, but in con&s;equence of his abu&s;e of them.</Q>
If this were ever &s;o true, it would not &s;ettle the que&s;tion concerning the origin of moral evil. For the que&s;|tion is not what is the cau&s;e or &s;ource of &s;in in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, as in hardening the heart, in con&s;e|quence of a former &s;in or &s;ins; but what is the cau&s;e of all &s;in, and particularly of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;in, whether in man or in the univer&s;e. Now to an&s;wer this que&s;|tion by &s;aying, that when a man has "abu&s;ed God's &s;pirit and grace," God delivers him up to &s;in, is as ab|&s;urd as to an&s;wer the que&s;tion concerning the origin of the human race, by &s;aying, that after Adam had lived a while, he begat a &s;on.</P>
<P>Although the Doctor thinks it certain from the texts, which he had examined, that I&s;ai. lxiii.17,
<Q>in|tends nothing more than that God leaves men to err and to harden their own hearts;</Q>
he does not choo&s;e to re&s;t the matter on that foundation; but ob|&s;erves, that
<Q>Hebrew verbs in Hiphil often &s;ignify only permi&s;&s;ion.</Q>
If this were ever &s;o true, it would de|cide nothing concerning I&s;ai. lxiii.17. If verbs in Hiphil do often &s;ignify only permi&s;&s;ion, this implies, that they often do not &s;ignify that only. Then the que&s;tion would be, what does it &s;ignify in this text?
<PB N="226" REF="032073_0224_0FF111DE743B0478">
Neither Dr. We&s;t nor any other Hebrai&s;t, will pretend, that a verb in Hiphil <HI>naturally</HI> &s;ignifies per|mi&s;&s;ion only. If therefore any verb in that conjuga|tion do &s;ignify that only, it mu&s;t be for &s;ome other rea&s;on, than merely becau&s;e it is in that conjugation. If there be any &s;uch rea&s;on in this ca&s;e, the Doctor has not informed us of it. Nor can I conceive of any, unle&s;s it be the &s;uppo&s;ed ab&s;urdity of under&s;tand|ing the text as it is tran&s;lated. But the Doctor mu&s;t on reflection be &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of taking that &s;uppo&s;ed ab&s;urdity for granted. Let him prove it, and he will oblige us to believe him.</P>
<P>On 1 Sam. xvi.14,
<Q>The &s;pirit of the Lord de|parted from Saul, and an evil &s;pirit from God troub|led him,</Q>
the Doctor remarks,
<Q><HI>i. e.</HI> he was left of God to his own gloomy and frightful imagina|tions; ibid, p. 57:</Q>
But who was the efficient cau&s;e of his own gloomy imaginations? Surely they did not happen out of nothing, like the athei&s;t's world. Nor will the Doctor pretend, that Saul de&s;ignedly pro|duced them in his own mind. So that he gives no account of the cau&s;e of tho&s;e imaginations, and no explanation of the text.</P>
<P><Q>If then the Deity creates &s;in, in the &s;en&s;e in which he creates darkne&s;s, it will follow, that as darkne&s;s is the con&s;equence of God's withdrawing light, &s;o the con&s;equence of God's withdrawing his &s;pirit and grace from any per&s;on, is &s;in; which will fall in exactly with our &s;en&s;e of God's hardening the heart.</Q>
If &s;in in no in&s;tance take place, but in con&s;equence of God's withdrawing his &s;pirit and grace from a per|&s;on; then God's &s;pirit and grace are &s;ometimes with|drawn from a per&s;on, antecedently to his &s;inning: And in tho&s;e ca&s;es they are not withdrawn in righteous judgment, and as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment of &s;in; becau&s;e the per&s;on, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, has been guilty of no ante|cedent &s;in. Yet the Doctor every where con&s;iders the withdrawment of God's &s;pirit and grace as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment of the &s;in of tho&s;e from whom it is with|drawn;
<PB N="227" REF="032073_0225_0FF111CE21144AD0">
as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment of the neglect and abu&s;e of the advantages, which they enjoyed, &amp;c. &amp;c. And on this ground only he attempts to ju&s;tify the with|drawment. If on the other hand, &s;in in any in&s;tance, do take place when there has been no withdrawment of the divine &s;pirit and grace; then the Doctor has here given no account of the exi&s;tence of &s;in in that in&s;tance; and &s;uch an in&s;tance there was, when &s;in fir&s;t came into exi&s;tence; it took place without a withdrawment of grace, in the way of righteous judg|ment.</P>
<P>It may here be added, that though darkne&s;s, a mere non-entity, will take place in con&s;equence of the withdrawment of light; yet malice, envy and inordi|nate &s;elf-love, po&s;itive acts of the mind, will no more take place in con&s;equence of mere withdrawment of influence, than benevolence or &s;upreme love to God, or the whole material creation, would come into ex|i&s;tence in con&s;equence of a mere withdrawment of the influence of God.</P>
<P><Q>We &s;ee in what &s;en&s;e God is &s;aid to move, &s;tir up or incline men to evil actions; viz. by permit|ting Satan to tempt men to evil, or by permitting things to take place, which <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> men to become perver&s;e.</Q>
Ibid, p. 64. If the Doctor by
<Q><HI>permitting</HI> things to take place, mean that God &s;o di&s;po&s;es things that certain definite events will infallibly fol|low&punc; this is all for which I plead, and which Pre&s;i|dent Edwards held on this head.</Q>
And &s;urely the Doctor does not mean, that things are of their own accord and by their own native power, independently of the divine agency, endeavouring to take place, and will effect the object of their endeavour, if they be permitted by the Deity; as a high mettled &s;teed, when permitted by his rider, leaps into a race. This would &s;avour too much of athei&s;m, to be holden by a Chri&s;tian divine. As to the human mind's making one volition by another or without another, I have nothing more to &s;ay; nor do I wi&s;h to &s;ay any more

<Q>implies no more than that the Deity meant to pun|i&s;h the Jews, by <HI>letting loo&s;e</HI> the King of A&s;&s;yria upon them; ibid. p. 67.</Q>
Yet in the &s;ame page he &s;ays, that the king of A&s;&s;yria
<Q>was as much under the control of the Deity&punc; as the axe and the &s;aw are un|der the control of the workman.</Q>
Yet this control over that king implies no more, it &s;eems, than that God let him loo&s;e on the Jews. And is no more implied in the control which the workman has over the axe and the &s;aw, than that he <HI>lets them loo&s;e</HI> on the timber? I appeal to the reader, whether if the king of A&s;&s;yria
<Q>was as much under the control of the Deity, as the axe and the &s;aw are under the control of the work|man; a po&s;itive and efficacious influence, and not a <HI>bare permi&s;&s;ion,</HI> be not implied in &s;uch con|trol.</Q></P>
<P>On Rev. xvii.17,
<Q>For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree and give their kingdom unto the bea&s;t, until the words of God &s;hall be fulfilled;</Q>
the Doctor remarks,
<Q>The&s;e ten kings are to agree &mdash; in giving their kingdom to the bea&s;t, that by his protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they may be able &mdash; entirely to de&s;troy the whore, by whom they have been long oppre&s;&s;ed.</Q>
Ibid, p. 68. Thus the Doctor &s;uppo&s;es, that the end, for which the&s;e ten kings give their power to the bea&s;t, is that by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance they may de&s;troy the great whore. But this is a mere <HI>&s;uppo&s;ition,</HI> un&s;upported by any thing in the text or context; nor does the Doctor give any rea&s;on toward its &s;upport. Be&s;ides, what advantage is there in this &s;uppo&s;ition? Is the bea&s;t mentioned a friend to virtue and religion? And did tho&s;e kings do their duty in giving their power into his hands? If they did not; of cour&s;e they did wrong;
<PB N="229" REF="032073_0227_0FF111CFCB1094A0">
and then the difficulty of God's putting it into their hearts to do this wrong &s;till remains.</P>
<P>On quoting I&s;ai. v.4;
<Q>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? Wherefore, when I looked, that it &s;hould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</Q>
the Doctor adds,
<Q>according to the &s;cheme I am oppo&s;ing, all that the Deity has done to his vine|yard, was to make it bring forth wild grapes. How could he then appeal to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem, to judge between him and his vineyard?</Q>
Ibid, p. 71, &amp;c. Now this and all the re&s;t that the Doctor adds in his remarks on that text, lies equally again&s;t the &s;cheme of a permi&s;&s;ive decree "perfectly and infallibly bounding,"
<Q>re&s;train|ing,</Q>
"marking out" and
<Q>fixing bounds to the ac|tions of men, beyond which they cannot pa&s;s.</Q>
For "according to this &s;cheme" of the Doctor,
<Q>all that the Deity has done to his vineyard was</Q>
by re|&s;training them from all other actions, by bounding them to tho&s;e very actions which they have perform|ed, and by fixing &s;uch bounds as they could not pa&s;s,
<Q>to make them bring forth wild grapes. How then could he appeal to the men of Judah and Jeru&s;alem to judge, between him and his vineyard? Will it be &s;aid, that the means u&s;ed with them were &s;uch, that if they had been rightly improved they would have enabled them to have brought forth good grapes? The an&s;wer &mdash; is very ea&s;y; the&s;e means could have no effect but &s;uch as the Deity de&s;igned them to have;</Q>
becau&s;e
<Q>the Deity fixed their bounds, beyond which they could not pa&s;s,</Q>
<Q>and they mu&s;t produce either good or bad grapes, according to the bounds fixed by the Deity.</Q>

Therefore, in&s;tead of appealing to &s;o uncer|tain a judge, I call on the Doctor him&s;elf, or any oth|er Hebrician good or bad, to point out the in&s;tances, whether frequent or unfrequent, in which <GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;igni|fies merely to <HI>permit</HI> or <HI>&s;uffer.</HI> Be&s;ide this, &s;ufficient rea&s;ons mu&s;t be given to convince the candid and ju|dicious, that it is u&s;ed in this &s;en&s;e, in the text now under con&s;ideration, and rea&s;ons which do not beg the main point, that God can do nothing toward the exi&s;tence of &s;in, but barely to permit it. When the&s;e things &s;hall have been done, we &s;hall have better ground, on which to believe the Doctor's critici&s;m, than his mere round a&s;&s;ertion.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now fini&s;hed my remarks on Dr. We&s;t's <HI>E&s;&s;ays on Liberty and Nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> If he &s;hall think proper to write again on tho&s;e &s;ubjects and to reply to the&s;e remarks, I reque&s;t him to attend to tho&s;e points only, which are material and affect the merits of the cau&s;e. If I have expo&s;ed my&s;elf by ever &s;o many inadvertencies, which do not affect the merits of the cau&s;e, to take up his own time and that of his readers, to exhibit them, &s;eems not worth while. In di&s;putes of this kind &s;uch inadvertencies are frequent. Al&s;o &s;uch di&s;putes are apt to degenerate into mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions, per&s;onal reflections and logomachy. How far I have fallen into any of the&s;e, it is not proper for me to &s;ay. However, I may &s;ay, that I have endeavour|ed to avoid them. I hope the Doctor will be &s;ucce&s;s|ful in the &s;ame endeavour.</P>
<P>If he &s;hall write again, I reque&s;t him to inform us more clearly, what he means by &s;elf-determination. If he mean no more than he hitherto profe&s;&s;es to mean, "that we our&s;elves determine;" he will in|form us, wherein on that head he differs from Pre&s;i|dent Edwards or any other man; and whether it be his opinion, that we determine our own volitions in any other &s;en&s;e, than we determine all our perceptions and feelings. &mdash; If he &s;hall be of the opinion, that we efficiently cau&s;e our own volitions; I reque&s;t him to inform us, how we do or can do this otherwi&s;e than by antecedent volitions. If he &s;hall grant, that this is the way, in which we cau&s;e them; he will plea&s;e to remove the ab&s;urdities &s;uppo&s;ed to attend that &s;uppo|&s;ition; and al&s;o decide whether or not we cau&s;e them without any re&s;traint by previous certainty, <HI>i. e.</HI> wheth|er we cau&s;e them by mere chance, and at hap-hazard.</P>
<P>If he &s;hall &s;till be of the opinion, that volition is no effect; he will plea&s;e to inform us how to recon|cile
<PB N="232" REF="032073_0230_0FF111D5E38097B0">
that with the idea, that it proceeds from an intrin|&s;ic cau&s;e and is originated by him who is the &s;ubject of it. If volition have a cau&s;e, whether intrin&s;ic or extrin&s;ic, it is of cour&s;e an effect.&mdash;He will al&s;o be &s;o kind as to inform us, whether every human volition exi&s;ted from eternity, or whether it came into exi&s;tence without cau&s;e.</P>
<P>If he &s;till maintain, that with re&s;pect to prai&s;e and blame, there is no difference between natural and mo|ral nece&s;&s;ity; I wi&s;h him to inform us, whether Judas were as blamele&s;s in betraying his Lord, becau&s;e it was previou&s;ly certain and certainly foretold, that he would do it, as he was for being attached to the &s;ur|face of the earth, and not a&s;cending to heaven as Eli|jah did.</P>
<P>I hope the Doctor will explain him&s;elf concerning antecedent and con&s;equent nece&s;&s;ity. If he mean, that before the exi&s;tence of any human action, there was no certainty, that it would exi&s;t; he will plea&s;e to reconcile this both with divine foreknowledge, and with the prophecies of &s;cripture. If by antecedent nece&s;&s;ity, he mean any thing el&s;e than antecedent cer|tainty, he will plea&s;e to &s;how how it is to the purpo&s;e, or how it oppo&s;es what we mean by antecedent ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>I reque&s;t him to &s;how the con&s;i&s;tency between the&s;e two propo&s;itions, that motive is nece&s;&s;ary to every volition; and that men do not always act on the &s;tronge&s;t motive. He will of cour&s;e &s;how, what the motive is which per&s;uades a man to pa&s;s by the &s;trong|e&s;t motive, and to act on a weaker.</P>
<P>It is to be wi&s;hed, that the Doctor would explain his favourite power <HI>to act or not act.</HI> If he &s;hall own, that he means a power to choo&s;e or refu&s;e merely, it is pre&s;umed, that his candour will lead him to own al|&s;o, that he means nothing on this head different from Pre&s;ident Edwards, unle&s;s by <HI>power</HI> he mean previous <HI>uncertainty,</HI> and by a man's power to choo&s;e or refu&s;e, he mean, that it is in it&s;elf and in the divine view <HI>un|certain,</HI>
<PB N="233" REF="032073_0231_0FF111E1B6C10B48">
whether he will choo&s;e or refu&s;e: And if he mean this, I wi&s;h him to avow it.</P>
<P>I hope he will not &s;pend time in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing que&s;|tions, which are merely verbal, &s;uch as whether mo|tive be the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> or the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> of volition. All that Pre&s;ident Edwards means by <HI>cau&s;e</HI> in this ca&s;e, is <HI>&s;tat|ed occa&s;ion</HI> or <HI>antecedent.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps the Doctor will find his book to be no le&s;s u&s;eful, if he &s;hall confine him&s;elf more to <HI>argument,</HI> and indulge him&s;elf le&s;s in <HI>hi&s;tory.</HI> Narratives, how|ever true and accurate, of his own opinion without his rea&s;ons, and of his ability or inability whether to do or to conceive, are very unintere&s;ting to tho&s;e who think for them&s;elves, and do not depend on the Doc|tor as an authority. If he had hitherto &s;pared all &s;uch narratives, his books had been con&s;iderably &s;horter and no le&s;s demon&s;trative.</P>
<P>I hope the Doctor will be very explicit in commu|nicating his idea of liberty. I pre&s;ume he will join with me in the opinion, that the whole controver&s;y turns on this. If the liberty nece&s;&s;ary to moral ac|tion be an exemption from all extrin&s;ic influence, we hold that the certain con&s;equence is that either we cau&s;e one volition by another; or that our volitions come into exi&s;tence without cau&s;e and by mere chance. Therefore the Doctor will plea&s;e to &s;how, that nei|ther of the&s;e con&s;equences follows; or will avow whichever he believes does follow.</P>
<P>He &s;uppo&s;es &s;elf-determination is free action. Now I wi&s;h him to inform us, whether &s;elf-determination, that is limited, bounded, governed and overruled, to a conformity to the divine purpo&s;e, as he a&s;&s;erts all the actions of rational creatures to be, is free action. If it be, I reque&s;t him to inform us, why an action decreed to be conformed to the &s;ame divine purpo&s;e, is not al&s;o free.</P>
<P>I rejoice, that this important &s;ubject has been tak|en up by &s;o able an advocate as Dr. We&s;t. From his high character we have a right to expect, that if
<PB N="234" REF="032073_0232_0FF111E35AE3B290">
the cau&s;e which he has undertaken, be capable of &s;upport, it will be &s;upported by the Doctor. I wi&s;h the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion had an advocate able to do it ju&s;tice. However, &s;ince I have embarked in the cau&s;e, I &s;hall, &s;o long as important matter is brought forward, do as well as I can, till I &s;hall either be con|vinced that the cau&s;e is a bad one, or find my&s;elf un|able to reply: And I doubt not, that my failure will draw forth to the &s;upport of the truth, &s;ome more able advocate, who now through mode&s;ty or &s;ome other cau&s;e, does not appear for its defence.</P>
<P>I think it is but fair, that Dr. We&s;t, and all others who write again&s;t moral nece&s;&s;ity, &s;hould take the ex|planations, which we give of moral and natural nece&s;|&s;ity and inability, and all other important terms in this di&s;qui&s;ition. And &s;o far as they oppo&s;e any doctrine which we hold, they ought to oppo&s;e it in the &s;en&s;e in which we hold it, and not in a &s;en&s;e which they may find it convenient to impute to us, becau&s;e they can more ea&s;ily confute it. Such a management of any que&s;tion as the la&s;t mentioned, will never bring it to an i&s;&s;ue, and be&s;ides is exceedingly di&s;ingenuous, and gives rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the goodne&s;s of the cau&s;e, in favour of which it is employed.</P>
<P>As this que&s;tion concerning liberty and nece&s;&s;ity affects the mo&s;t important &s;ubjects of morality and religion; it is to be wi&s;hed, that the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of it may finally conduce to the more clear under&s;tanding and the more &s;incere and cheerful practice of virtue and piety, and to the glory of our God and Redeemer.</P>
