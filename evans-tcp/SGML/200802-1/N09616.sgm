<HEAD>The TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the great Utility of tho&s;e medical Directions, with which the following Treati&s;e is thoroughly repleni&s;hed, will be &s;ufficiently evident to every plain and &s;en&s;ible Peru&s;er of it; and its extraordinary Reception on the Continent is recited in the very worthy Author's Preface; yet &s;omething, it &s;hould &s;eem, may be pertinently added, with regard to this Tran&s;lation of it, by a Per&s;on who has been &s;trictly attentive to the Original: a Work, who&s;e Purpo&s;e was truly nece&s;&s;ary and benevolent; as the Execu|tion, in general, is very happily accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>It will be &s;elf-evident, I apprehend, to every di&s;cerning Phy&s;i|cian, that a radical knowledge of the Principles, and much Ex|perience in the Exerci&s;e of their Profe&s;&s;ion, were nece&s;&s;ary to ac|commodate &s;uch a Work to the Comprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e, for whom it was more particularly calculated. Such Gentlemen mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, that the certain Axiom of <HI>Nature's curing Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> which is equally true in our Day, as it was in that of HIPPOCRATES, &s;o habitually animates this Treati&s;e, as not to require the lea&s;t par|ticular Reference. This <HI>Hippocratic</HI> Truth as certain (though much le&s;s &s;ubject to general Ob&s;ervation) as that Di&s;ea&s;e, or Age, is finally prevalent over all &s;ublunary Life, the mo&s;t attentive Phy|&s;icians di&s;cern the &s;oone&s;t, the mo&s;t ingenuous readily confe&s;s: and hence &s;pring that whole&s;ome Zeal and Severity, with which Dr. TISSOT encounters &s;uch Prejudices of poor illiterate Per&s;ons, as either oppo&s;e, or very ignorantly precipitate, her Operations, in her Attainment of Health. The&s;e Prejudices indeed may &s;eem, from his Work, to be &s;till more numerous, and perhaps gro&s;&s;er too, in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland</HI> than among our&s;elves; though it is certain there is but too much Room for the Application of his &s;alutary Cautions and Directions, even in this Capital; and doubtle&s;s abun|dantly more at a great Di&s;tance from it. It may be very ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed, for <HI>one</HI> In&s;tance, that in mo&s;t of tho&s;e Ca&s;es in the &s;mall Pocks, in which the Mother undertakes the Cure of her Child, or confides it to a Nur&s;e, that Saffron, in a greater or le&s;s Quan|tity, and Sack or Mountain Whey, are generally &s;till u&s;ed in the Sickening before Eruption; to accelerate that very Eruption, who&s;e gradual Appearance, about the fourth Day, from that of Seizure inclu&s;ive, is &s;o favourable and promi&s;ing to the Patient; and the Precipitation of which is often &s;o highly pernicious. Mo&s;t of, or rather all, his other Cautions and Corrections &s;eem equally nece&s;&s;ary here, as often as the Sick are &s;imilarly circum&s;tanced, under the different acute Di&s;ea&s;es in which he enjoins them.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="012243_0003_0F8A37A8E3BC50C0">Without the lea&s;t Detraction however from our excellent Au|thor, it may be admitted that a few others, in different Countries, might have &s;ufficient Abilities and Experience for the Production of a like Work, on the &s;ame good Plan. This, we find Dr. HIR|ZEL, principal Phy&s;ician of <HI>Zurich,</HI> had in Meditation, when the pre&s;ent Treati&s;e appeared, which he thought had &s;o thoroughly fulfilled his own Intention, that it prevented his attempting to execute it. But the great Difficulty con&s;i&s;ted in di&s;covering a Phy&s;ician, who, with equal Abilities, Reputation and Practice, &s;hould be qualified with that <HI>much rarer</HI> Qualification, of caring &s;o much more for the Health of tho&s;e, who could never pay him for it, than for his own Profit or Ea&s;e, as to determine him to project and to accompli&s;h &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and yet &s;o &s;elf-denying a Work. For as the Simplicity he propo&s;ed in the Style and Manner of it, (by conde&s;cending, in the plaine&s;t Terms, to the humble&s;t Capa|cities) obliged him to depre&s;s him&s;elf, by writing rather beneath the former Treati&s;es, which had acquired him the Reputation of medical Erudition, Rea&s;oning and Elegance; we find that the Love of Fame it&s;elf, &s;o &s;timulating even to many ingenuous Minds, was as impotent as that of Wealth, to &s;educe him from &s;o benign, &s;o generous a Purpo&s;e. Though, upon Reflection, it is by no Means &s;trange to &s;ee wi&s;e Men found their Happine&s;s, which all [however variou&s;ly and even oppo&s;itely] pur&s;ue, rather in Con|&s;cience, than on Applau&s;e: and this naturally reminds us of that celebrated Expre&s;&s;ion of CATO, or &s;ome other excellent Antient, "that he had rather <HI>be</HI> good, than <HI>be reputed</HI> &s;o."</P>
<P>However &s;ingular &s;uch a Determination may now appear, the number of reputable medical Tran&s;lators into different Lan|guages, which this original Work has employed on the Conti|tinent, makes it evident that real Merit will, &s;ooner or later, have a pretty general Influence; and induce many to imitate that Example, which they either could not, or did not, propo&s;e. As the truly mode&s;t Author has profe&s;&s;edly di&s;claimed all Applau&s;e on the Performance, and contented him&s;elf with hoping an Ex|emption from Cen&s;ure, through his Reader's Reflection on the peculiar Circum&s;tances and Addre&s;s of it; well may his be&s;t, his faithfulle&s;t Tran&s;lators, who&s;e Merit and Pains mu&s;t be of a very &s;econdary Degree to his own, re&s;t &s;atisfied with a &s;imilar Exemp|tion: e&s;pecially when joined to the Plea&s;ure, that mu&s;t re&s;ult from a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their having endeavoured to extend the Bene|fits of their Author's Treati&s;e, to Multitudes of their own Coun|try and Language.</P>
<P>For my own particular, when, after reading the Introduction to the Work, and much of the Sequel, I had determined to tran&s;|late it; to be as ju&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to the Author, and to his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Readers, I determined not to interpolate any Sentiment of my own into the Text, nor to omit one Sentence of the Original, which, be&s;ides its being <HI>Detraction</HI> in a literal Sen&s;e, I thought might imply it in its wor&s;t, its figurative one; for which there
<PB N="v" REF="012243_0004_0F8A37A98C5C7978">
was no Room. To conform as fully as po&s;&s;ible to the Plainne&s;s and Per&s;picuity he propo&s;ed I have been pretty often obliged in the anatomical Names of &s;ome Parts, and &s;ometimes of the Symp|toms, as well as in &s;ome pretty familiar, though not entirely po|pular Words, to explain all &s;uch by the mo&s;t common Words I have heard u&s;ed for them; as after mentioning the <HI>Diaphragm,</HI> to add, or <HI>Midriff</HI>&mdash;the <HI>Trachoea</HI>&mdash;or <HI>Windpipe&mdash;acrimonious,</HI> or <HI>very &s;harp,</HI> and &s;o of many others. This may a little, though but a little, have extended the Tran&s;lation beyond the Original; as the great Affinity between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> and between the for|mer and many <HI>Latin</HI> Words borrowed from the <HI>Greek,</HI> generally makes the &s;ame anatomical or medical Term, that is technical with us, vernacular or common with them. But this unavoidable Tautology, which may be irk&s;ome to many Ears, tho&s;e medical Readers, for whom it was not intended, will readily forgive, from a Con&s;ideration of the general Addre&s;s of the Work: while they reflect that a plain intelligible Style is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary in tho&s;e Books, which wholly con&s;i&s;t of very u&s;eful, and generally intere&s;ting, Matter.</P>
<P>As many of the Notes of the Editor of <HI>Lyons,</HI> as I have retained in this Ver&s;ion (this Tran&s;lation being made from that Edition) are &s;ub&s;cribed <HI>E. L.</HI> I have di&s;pen&s;ed with &s;everal, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e, as evi|dently le&s;s within Dr. TISSOT's Plan, from tending to theorize, however ju&s;tly or practically, where he mu&s;t have had his own Rea&s;ons for omitting to theorize: a few others, as manife&s;tly needle&s;s, from what the Author had either premi&s;ed, or &s;peedily &s;ubjoined, on the very &s;ame Circum&s;tance: be&s;ides, a very few, from their local Confinement to the Practice at <HI>Lyons,</HI> which lies in a Climate &s;omewhat more different from our own than that of <HI>Lau&s;anne.</HI> It is probable, neverthele&s;s, I have retained a few more of tho&s;e Notes, than were nece&s;&s;ary in a profe&s;&s;ed Tran&s;lation of the original Work: but wherever I have done this, I have gene|rally &s;ubjoined my Motive for it; of whatever Con&s;equence that may appear to the Reader. I have retained all the Author's own Notes, with his Name annexed to them; and wherever the An|notator was uncertain to me, I have declared who&s;e Note I &s;up|po&s;ed it to be.</P>
<P>Such as I have added from my own Experience or Ob&s;ervation are &s;ub&s;cribed <HI>K.</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the former; and that the Demerit of any of them may neither be imputed to the learn|ed Author, nor to that Editor. Their principal Recommenda|tion, or Apology is, that whatever Facts I have mentioned are certainly true. I have endeavoured to be temperate in their Num|ber and Length, and to imitate that &s;trict Pertinence, which pre|vails throughout the <HI>Author</HI>'s Work. If any may have ever con|de&s;cended to con&s;ider my Way of Writing, they will conceive this Re&s;traint has co&s;t me at lea&s;t as much Pains, as a further In|dulgence of my own Conceptions could have done. The few Pre&s;criptions I have included in &s;ome of them, have been &s;o con|ducted,
<PB N="vi" REF="012243_0005_0F8A37AA4E77BC40">
as not to give the Readers the lea&s;t Confu&s;ion with re|&s;pect to tho&s;e, which the Author has given in his Table of Re|medies, and which are referred to by numerical Figures, through|out the Cour&s;e of this Book.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Edition of this Tran&s;lation is taken from my &s;e|cond, but with the Addition of &s;ome more Notes of my own, which &s;eemed to me material, be&s;ides a very few &s;ugge&s;ted by a learned and experienced Friend, which I have adopted. A new <HI>French</HI> Edition of this Work has lately appeared at <HI>Paris,</HI> though not under Dr. TISSOT's Direction; in which there are two or three Chapters on as many chronical Di&s;ea&s;es; but which our Author, who confined his valuable Work &s;olely to acute Di&s;|ea&s;es, had of cour&s;e excluded from his Plan. The&s;e we have therefore, and we think very con&s;i&s;tently, omitted to tran&s;late; as we deemed it rather improper and illiberal, to blend the Inter|polations of another Writer, (who is anonymous too) with Dr. TISSOT's original Work; the&s;e Interpolations being on &s;uch Ar|ticles too, as he had for excellent Rea&s;ons, which he &s;pecifies in his own Preface, declined to treat of. Whether &s;uch Additions then were officiou&s;ly made by any Volunteer Phy&s;ician, or pro|cured by a Book&s;eller, doubtle&s;s the Intention was either to in|crea&s;e the intrin&s;ic Value, or to extend the Sale of their new Edition of the <HI>Avis au Peuple</HI>: though it is much likelier the&s;e Additions may chance to be read, more in Con&s;equence of the Merit of his original Work, than on that of their own; in|to which however I confe&s;s I have very little enquired. But whatever that Merit may prove, it was certainly a probable Ex|pedient to introduce it; notwith&s;tanding the Ingraftment of the&s;e Chapters gives them the Air of a Tumour or Excre&s;cence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This additional Paragraph to the Tran&s;lator's former Preface, favours him with an Opportunity of acknowledging his Obligations to the great Candour and indulgence of the Public, in regard to his Tran&s;lation of this Work.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The moderate Number of Dr. TISSOT's Pre&s;criptions, in his Table of Remedies, amounting but to &s;eventy-one, and the Ap|parent Simplicity of many of them, may po&s;&s;ibly di&s;gu&s;t &s;ome Admirers of pompous and complex Pre&s;cription. But his Re|&s;erve, in this important Re&s;pect, has been thoroughly con&s;i&s;tent with his Notion of Nature's curing Di&s;ea&s;es; which &s;ugge&s;ted to him the fir&s;t, the e&s;&s;ential Nece&s;&s;ity of cautioning his Readers a|gain&s;t doing, giving or applying any thing, that might oppo&s;e her healing Operations (a mo&s;t capital Purpo&s;e of his Work) which important Point being gained, the milde&s;t, the &s;imple&s;t and lea&s;t hazardous Remedies would often prove &s;ufficient a&s;&s;i&s;tants to her. Neverthele&s;s, under more &s;evere and painful Conflicts, he is not wanting to direct the mo&s;t potent and efficacious ones. The Circum&s;tances of the poor Subjects of his medical Con&s;idera|tion, became al&s;o a very natural Object to him; and was in no
<PB N="vii" REF="012243_0006_0F8A37AB0E63D680">
wi&s;e unworthy the Regard of the humane Tran&s;lator of BIL|GUER <HI>on</HI> AMPUTATIONS, or rather <HI>again&s;t</HI> the crying Abu&s;e of them; an excellent Work, which does real Honour to them both; and which can be di&s;approved by none, who do not prefer the fre|quently unnece&s;&s;ary Mutilation of the Afflicted, to the ingro&s;&s;ing a greater Portion of their Time; whence they may apprehend a Contraction of their Employment.</P>
<P>Some Per&s;ons may imagine that a Treati&s;e of this Kind, com|po&s;ed for the benefit of labouring People in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> may be little applicable to tho&s;e of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> I&s;lands. This, in a very few Particulars, and in a &s;mall Degree, may be true indeed. But as we find their common Prejudices are often the very &s;ame; as the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> are the Inhabitants of a colder Climate than <HI>France,</HI> and generally, as Dr. TISSOT often ob&s;erves, accu&s;tomed to drink (like our&s;elves) more &s;trong Drink than the <HI>French</HI> Pea&s;antry; and to indulge more in eating Fle&s;h too, which the Religion of <HI>Berne,</HI> like our own, does not re&s;train; the Application of his Advice to them will pretty generally hold good here. Where he forbids them Wine and Fle&s;h, all Butchers Meat, and in mo&s;t Ca&s;es all Fle&s;h, and all &s;trong Drink &s;hould be prohibited here: e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider, that his Directions are confined to the Treat|ment of acute Di&s;ea&s;es, of which the very young, the youthful, and frequently even the robu&s;t are more generally the Subjects. Be&s;ides, in &s;ome few of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lator's Notes, he has ta|ken the Liberty of moderating the Coolers, or the Quantities of them (which may be well adapted to the great Heats and violent <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Summers Dr. TISSOT talks of) according to the Tempera|ture of our own Climate, and the general Habitudes of our own People. It may be ob&s;erved too, that from the &s;ame Motive, I have &s;ometimes a&s;&s;umed the Liberty of di&s;&s;enting from the Text in a very few Notes; as for In&s;tance, on the Article of Pa&s;try, which perhaps is generally better here than in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland</HI> (where it may be as bad as our coar&s;e vile Tra&s;h that is hawked about and &s;old to meer Children) as I have frequently, in preparing for Inoculation admitted the be&s;t Pa&s;try (but never of Meat, and very &s;eldom any Chee&s;ecakes) into the limited Diet of the Sub|jects of Inoculation, and con&s;tantly without the lea&s;t ill Con|&s;equence. Thus al&s;o in Note * Page 145, 146, I have pre&s;umed to affirm the Fact, that a &s;trong &s;pirituous Infu&s;ion of the Bark has &s;ucceeded more &s;peedily in &s;ome Intermittents, in particular Habits, than the Bark in Sub&s;tance. This I humbly conceive may be owing to &s;uch a <HI>Men&s;truum's</HI> extracting the Re&s;in of the Bark more effectually (and &s;o conveying it into the Blood) than the Juices of the Stomach and of the alimentary Canal did, or could. For it is very conceivable that the <HI>Cra&s;is,</HI> the Con&s;i&s;tence, of the fibrous Blood may &s;ometimes be affected with a morbid Laxity or Weakne&s;s, as well as the general Sy&s;tem of the mu&s;cu|lar Fibres.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="012243_0007_0F8A37ABCBC0ED28">The&s;e and any other like Freedoms I am certain the Author's Candour will abundantly pardon; &s;ince I have never di&s;&s;ented from him, for the &s;ake of di&s;&s;enting; and have the Honour of harmonizing very generally in Judgment with him. If <HI>one</HI> u&s;e|ful Hint or Ob&s;ervation occurs throughout my Notes, his Bene|volence will exult in that e&s;&s;ential Adherence to his Plan, which &s;ugge&s;ted it to me: While an invariable echoing A&s;&s;entation throughout &s;uch Notes, when there really was any &s;alutary Room for doubting, or for adding (with re&s;pect to our&s;elves) would di&s;cover a Servility, that mu&s;t have di&s;gu&s;ted a liberal manly Writer. One common good Purpo&s;e certainly &s;prings from the generous Source, and repleni&s;hes the many Chanels in|to which it is derived; all the Variety and little Deviations of which may be con&s;idered as more expan&s;ive Di&s;tributions of its Benefits.</P>
<P>Since the natural Feelings of Humanity generally di&s;po&s;e us, but e&s;pecially the more tender and compa&s;&s;ionate Sex, to advi&s;e Re|medies to tho&s;e Sick, who are additionally mi&s;erable, from their being poor; &s;uch a Knowledge of their real Di&s;ea&s;e, as would prevent their Patrons, Neighbours and A&s;&s;i&s;tants from advi&s;ing a wrong Regimen, or an improper or ill-timed Medicine, is truly e&s;&s;ential to relieving them: and &s;uch we &s;eriou&s;ly think the pre|&s;ent Work is capable of imparting, to all commonly &s;en&s;ible and con&s;iderate Peru&s;ers of it. A Vein of unaffected Probity, of man|ly &s;en&s;e, and of great Philanthrophy, concur to &s;u&s;tain the Work: and whenever the Prejudices of the ignorant require a forcible Eradication; or the crude Temerity and Impudence of Knaves and Impo&s;tors cry out for their own Extermination, a happy Mix|ture of &s;trong Argument; ju&s;t Ridicule, and hone&s;t Severity, gives a poignant and plea&s;ant Sea&s;oning to the Work, which renders it occa&s;ionally entertaining, as it is continually in&s;tructive.</P>
<P>A general Reader may be &s;ometimes diverted with &s;uch Cu&s;|toms and Notions of the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Pea&s;ants, as are occa&s;ionally men|tioned here: and po&s;&s;ibly our meere&s;t Ru&s;tics may laugh at the brave &s;imple <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> on his introducing a Sheep into the Chamber of a very &s;ick Per&s;on, to &s;ave the Life of the Patient, by catching its own Death. But the Pea&s;antry of both Nations are agreed in &s;uch a Number of their ab&s;urd unhealthy Prejudices, in the Treat|ment of Di&s;ea&s;es, that it really &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to offer our own the Cautions and Coun&s;els of this principal Phy&s;ician, in a very re&s;pectable Prote&s;tant Republick, in order to prevent their Conti|nuance. Nor is it unrea&s;onable to pre&s;ume, that under &s;uch a Form of Government, (if hone&s;tly admini&s;tred upon its ju&s;te&s;t Principles) the People may be rather more tenderly regarded, than under the Pomp and Rage of De&s;poti&s;m, or the Oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome tumultuous Ari&s;tocracies.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the different Conditions of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of all the&s;e the Schoolma&s;ters, <HI>with us,</HI> may &s;eem the mo&s;t rea&s;onably ex|empted from this Duty.</NOTE> Per&s;ons, to whom our

Author recommends the Patronage and Execution of his Scheme, in his Introduction, it is conceived this Book mu&s;t be &s;erviceable to many young Practioners, and to great Numbers of Apotheca|ries, by furni&s;hing them with &s;uch exact and &s;triking De&s;criptions of each acute Di&s;ea&s;e and its Symptoms, as may prevent their mi&s;taking it for any other; a Deception which has certainly of|ten been injurious, and &s;ometimes even fatal: for it is dreadful but to contemplate the De&s;truction or Mi&s;ery, with which Teme|rity and Ignorance, &s;o frequently combined, overwhelm the Sick. Thus (if better informed and in&s;tructed) more Succe&s;s and Re|putation, with the Enjoyment of a better Con&s;cience, would crown their Endeavours, by a more general Recovery of, or Re|lief to, their Patients. To effect this, to improve every Opportu|nity of e&s;chewing medical Evil, and of doing medical Good, was the Author's avowed Intention; which he informs us in his Pre|face, he has heard, from &s;ome intelligent and charitable Per&s;ons, his Treati&s;e had effected, even in &s;ome violent Di&s;ea&s;es. That the &s;ame good Con&s;equences may every where attend the nume|rous Tran&s;lations of it, mu&s;t be the fervent Wi&s;h of all, except the Quacks and Impo&s;tors he &s;o ju&s;tly characteri&s;es in his thirty-third Chapter! and particularly of all, who may be di&s;tingui&s;hably qua|lified, like him&s;elf, to,

<HEAD>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF Vanity too often di&s;po&s;es many to &s;peak of them&s;elves, there are &s;ome Occa&s;ions, on which a total Silence might be &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ult from a &s;till higher Degree of it: And the very general Reception of the <HI>Ad|vice to the People</HI> has been &s;uch, that there would be room to &s;u&s;pect me of that mo&s;t &s;hocking Kind of Pride, which receives Applau&s;e with Indifference (as deeming its own Merit &s;uperior to the greate&s;t) if I did not appear to be &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of that great Favour of the Publick, which has been &s;o very obliging, and &s;o highly agreeable, to me.</P>
<P>Unfeignedly affected with the unhappy Situation of the poor Sick in Coun|try Places in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> where they are lo&s;t from a Scarcity of the be&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and from a fatal Superfluity of the wor&s;t, my &s;ole Purpo&s;e in writing this Treati&s;e has been to &s;erve, and to comfort them. I had in|tended it only for a &s;mall Extent of Country, with a moderate Number of Inhabitants; and was greatly &s;urprized to find, that within five or &s;ix Months after its Publication, it was become one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ively pub|li&s;hed Books in <HI>Europe</HI>; and one of tho&s;e Treati&s;es, on a &s;cientific Sub|ject, which has been peru&s;ed by the greate&s;t Number of Readers of all Ranks and Conditions. To con&s;ider &s;uch Succe&s;s with Indifference, were to have been unworthy of it, which Demerit, at lea&s;t on this Account, I cannot ju&s;tly be charged with; &s;ince Indifference has not been my Ca&s;e, who have felt as I ought this Gratification of &s;elf-love; which, under ju&s;t and pru|dent Re&s;trictions, may perhaps be even politically cheri&s;hed: as the Delight na|turally ari&s;ing from having been approved, is a Source of that laudable E|mulation, which has &s;ometimes produced the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential good Con&s;equen|ces to Society it&s;elf. For my own particular, I can truly aver, that my Satisfaction has been exqui&s;itely heightened on this Occa&s;ion, as a Lover of my Species: &s;ince judging from the Succe&s;s of this Work (a Succe&s;s which has exceeded my utmo&s;t Expectations) of the Effects that may rea&s;onably be hoped for from it, I am happily con&s;cious of that Satisfaction, or even Joy, which every truly hone&s;t Man mu&s;t receive, from rendering e&s;&s;ential good Offices to others. Be&s;ides which, I have enjoyed, in its utmo&s;t Ex|tent, that Satisfaction which every grateful Man mu&s;t receive, from the Approbation and Beneficence of his Sovereign, when I was di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="xiv" REF="012243_0012_0F8A37B050CD0680">
with the precious Medal, which the illu&s;trious Chamber of Health of the Republick of <HI>Berne</HI> honoured me with, a few Months after the Publica|on of this Treati&s;e; together with a Letter &s;till more e&s;timable, as it a&s;|&s;ured me of the extraordinary Satisfaction the Republick had te&s;tified on the Impre&s;&s;ion of it; a Circum&s;tance, which I could not avoid this publick Ac|knowledgement of, without the greate&s;t Vanity and Ingratitude. This has al&s;o been a very influencing Motive with me, to exert my utmo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ties in perfecting this new Edition, in which I have made many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> that render it greatly preferable to the fir&s;t; and of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;hall give a brief Account, after &s;aying &s;omewhat of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> which have appeared el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is that, which Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Heidegger,</HI> the Book&s;ellers, publi&s;hed in the <HI>German</HI> Language at <HI>Zurich,</HI> about a year &s;ince. I &s;hould have been highly delighted with the meer Approbation of <HI>M. HIRZEL,</HI> fir&s;t Phy&s;ician of the Canton of <HI>Zurich,</HI> &amp;c. who&s;e &s;uperior and univer&s;al Ta|lents; who&s;e profound Knowledge in the Theory of Phy&s;ick; and the Ex|tent and Succe&s;s of who&s;e Practice have ju&s;tly elevated him among the &s;mall Number of extraordinary Men of our own Times; he having lately obtained the e&s;teem and the Thanks of all <HI>Europe,</HI> for the Hi&s;tory of one of her <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Le Socrate ru&s;tique,</HI> a Work, which every Per&s;on &s;hould read.</NOTE> Sages. But I little expected the Honour this Gentleman has done me, in tran&s;lating the <HI>Advice to the People</HI> into his own Language. Highly &s;en&s;ible neverthele&s;s as I am of this Honour, I mu&s;t always reflect with Re|gret, that he has con&s;umed that important Time, in rendering my Directi|ons intelligible, to his Countrymen, which he might have employed much more u&s;efully, in obliging the World with his own.</P>
<P>He has enriched his Tran&s;lation with an excellent Preface, which is chiefly employed in a ju&s;t and beautiful Portrait and Contra&s;t of the true, and of the fal&s;e Phy&s;ician; with which I &s;hould have done my&s;elf the Plea|&s;ure to have adorned the pre&s;ent <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This Preface is indeed premi&s;ed to this <HI>French</HI> Edition, but a Tran&s;lation of it was omitted, to avoid extending the Bulk and Price of the Work. Dr. TISSOT mu&s;t then have been ignorant of this Addition, when fir&s;t publi&s;hed at <HI>Lyons.</HI></NOTE> Edition; if the Size of this Volume, al|ready too large, had not proved an Ob&s;tacle to &s;o con&s;iderable an Addition; and if the Manner, in which <HI>Mr. HIRZEL</HI> &s;peaks of its Author, had permitted me with Decency to publi&s;h his Preface. I have been informed by &s;ome Letters, that there have been two other <HI>German</HI> Tran&s;lations of it; but I am not informed by whom. However, <HI>Mr. HIRZEL's</HI> Preface, his own Notes, and &s;ome Additions with which I have furni&s;hed him, render his Edition preferable to the fir&s;t in <HI>French,</HI> and to the other <HI>German</HI> Tran&s;lations already made.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Edition is that, which the younger <HI>DIDOT,</HI> the Book&s;eller, publi&s;hed towards the End of the Winter at <HI>Paris.</HI> He had reque&s;ted me to furni&s;h him with &s;ome Additions to it, which I could not readily comply with.</P>
<P>The third Edition is a <HI>Dutch</HI> Tran&s;lation of it, which will be very &s;pee|dily publi&s;hed by <HI>M. RENIER AREMBERG,</HI> Book&s;eller at <HI>Rotterdam.</HI> He had begun the Tran&s;lation from my fir&s;t Edition; but having wrote to
<PB N="xv" REF="012243_0013_0F8A37B10D284170">
know whether I had not &s;ome Additions to make, I de&s;ired him to wait for the Publication of this. I have the good Fortune to be very happy in my Tran&s;lators: it being <HI>M. BIKKER,</HI> a celebrated Phy&s;ician at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> (&s;o very advantageou&s;ly known in other Countries, by his beautiful <HI>Di&s;&s;er|tation on Human Nature</HI>: throughout which Genius and Knowledge proceed Hand in Hand) who will pre&s;ent his Countrymen with the <HI>Advice to the People,</HI> in their own Language: and who will improve it with &s;uch Notes, as are nece&s;&s;ary for a &s;afe and proper Application of its Contents in a Climate, different from that in which it was wrote. I have al&s;o heard, there has been an <HI>Italian</HI> Tran&s;lation of it.</P>
<P>After this Account of the foreign Editions, I return to the pre&s;ent one, which is the &s;econd of the original <HI>French</HI> Treati&s;e. I &s;hall not affirm it is greatly corrected, with re&s;pect to fundamental Points: for as I had advanced no|thing in the fir&s;t, that was not e&s;tabli&s;hed on Truth and Demon&s;tration, there was no Room for Correction, with regard to any e&s;&s;ential Matters. Neverthele&s;s, in this I have made, <HI>1,</HI> a great Number of &s;mall Alterations in the Diction, and added &s;everal Words, to render the Work &s;till more &s;imple and per&s;picuous. <HI>2,</HI> The typographical Execution of this is con&s;iderably improved in the Type, the Paper and Ink, Spelling, Pointing, and Ar|rangement of the Work. <HI>3,</HI> I have made &s;ome con&s;iderable Additions, which are of three Kinds. Not a few of them are new Articles on &s;ome of the Subjects formerly treated of; &s;uch as the Articles concerning Tarts and other Pa&s;try Ware; the Addition concerning the Regimen for Per&s;ons, in a State of Recovery from Di&s;ea&s;es; the Preparation for the Small Pocks; a long Note on the Je&s;uits Bark; another on acid Spirits; one on the Ex|tract of Hemlock, be&s;ides &s;ome new Matter which I have in&s;erted; &s;uch as an Article with regard to proper Drinks; one on the Convul&s;ions of In|fants; one on Chilblains; another on Punctures from Thorns; one upon the Rea&s;on of the Confidence repo&s;ed in Quacks, and the thirty-fir&s;t Chapter entirely: in which I have extended the Con&s;ideration of &s;ome for|mer Articles, that &s;eemed to me a little too &s;uccinct and &s;hort. There are &s;ome Alterations of this la&s;t, this additional, Kind, inter&s;per&s;ed almo&s;t throughout the whole Sub&s;tance of this Edition; but e&s;pecially in the two Chapters relating to Women and Children.</P>
<P>The objects of the <HI>XXXI</HI> Chapter are &s;uch as require immediate A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, <HI>viz.</HI> Swoonings, Haemorrhages, that is, large &s;pontaneous Bleed|ings; the Attacks of Convul&s;ions, and of Suffocations; the Con&s;equences of Fright and Terror; Di&s;orders occa&s;ioned by unwhole&s;ome or deadly Va|pours; the Effects of Poi&s;on, and the &s;udden Inva&s;ions of exce&s;&s;ive Pain.</P>
<P>The Omi&s;&s;ion of this Chapter was a very material Defect in the original Plan of this Work. The Editor of it at <HI>Paris</HI> was very &s;en&s;ible of this Cha&s;m, or Blank, as it maybe called, and has filled it up very properly: and if I have not made u&s;e of his Supplement, in&s;tead of enlarging my&s;elf upon the Articles of which he has treated, it has only been from a Purpo&s;e of rendering the whole Work more uniform; and to avoid that odd Diver&s;i|ty, which &s;eems &s;carcely to be avoided in a Treati&s;e compo&s;ed by two Per|&s;ons. Be&s;ides which, that Gentleman has &s;aid nothing of the Articles,
<PB N="xvi" REF="012243_0014_0F8A37B1CD6732B8">
which employ the greate&s;t Part of that Chapter, <HI>viz.</HI> the Swoonings, the Con&s;equences of great Fear, and of noxious Vapours.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I ought to ju&s;tify my&s;elf, as well as po&s;&s;ible, to a great Number of very re&s;pectable Per&s;ons, both here and abroad, (to whom I can refu&s;e nothing without great Chagrin and Reluctance) for my not hav|ing made &s;uch Additions as they de&s;ired of me. This however was impo&s;&s;ible as the Objects, in which they concurred, were &s;ome chronical Di&s;tempers, that are entirely out of the Plan, to which I was &s;trictly attached, for many Rea&s;ons. The fir&s;t is, that it was my original Purpo&s;e to oppo&s;e the Errors incurred in Country Places, in the Treatment of acute Di&s;ea&s;es; and to di&s;play the be&s;t Method of conducting &s;uch, as do not admit of waiting for the Arrival of di&s;tant Succour; or of removing the Patients to Cities, or large Towns. It is but too true indeed, that chronical Di&s;ea&s;es are al&s;o liable to improper Treatment in &s;mall Country Places: but then there are both Time and Convenience to convey the Patients within the Reach of better Advice; or for procuring them the Attendance of the be&s;t Advi&s;ers, at their own Places of Re&s;idence. Be&s;ides which, &s;uch Di&s;tem|pers are con&s;iderably le&s;s common than tho&s;e, to which I had re&s;trained my Views: and they will become &s;till le&s;s frequent, whenever acute Di&s;ea&s;es, of which they are frequently the Con&s;equences, &s;hall be more rationally and &s;afely conducted.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Rea&s;on, which, if alone, would have been a &s;ufficient one, is, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ubject the Treatment of chronical Di&s;tempers to the Capacity and Conduct of Per&s;ons, who are not Phy&s;icians. Each acute Di&s;temper generally ari&s;es from one Cau&s;e, and the Treatment of it is &s;im|ple and uniform; &s;ince tho&s;e Symptoms, which manife&s;t the Malady, point out its Cau&s;e and Treatment. But the Ca&s;e is very Differently cir|cum&s;tanced in tedious and languid Di&s;ea&s;es; each of which may depend on &s;o many and various Cau&s;es (and it is only the real, the true Cau&s;e, which ought to determine us in &s;electing its proper Remedies) that though the Di&s;|temper and its Appellation are evidently known, a meer By-&s;tander may be very remote from penetrating into its true Cau&s;e; and con&s;equently be inca|pable of chu&s;ing the be&s;t Medicines for it. It is this preci&s;e and di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Di&s;cernment of the real particular Cau&s;e [<HI>or of the contingent Concurrence of more than one</HI>] that nece&s;&s;arily requires the Pre&s;ence of Per&s;ons conver&s;ant in the Study and the Practice of all the Parts of Phy&s;ick; and which Knowledge it is impo&s;&s;ible for People, who are Stran|gers to &s;uch Studies, to arrive at. Moreover, their frequent Complexne&s;s; the Variety of their Symptoms; the different Stages of the&s;e tedious Di&s;ea&s;es [not exactly attended to even by many competent Phy&s;icians] the Difficulty of a&s;certaining different Do&s;es of Medicines, who&s;e Activity may make the &s;malle&s;t Error highly dangerous, &amp;c. &amp;c. are really &s;uch trying Circum|&s;tances, as render the fitte&s;t Treatment of the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es &s;ufficiently difficult and embarra&s;&s;ing to the mo&s;t experienced Phy&s;icians, and unattainable by tho&s;e who are not Phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>A third Rea&s;on is, that, even &s;uppo&s;ing all the&s;e Circum&s;tances might be made &s;o plain and ea&s;y, as to be comprehended by every Reader, they would require a Work of an exce&s;&s;ive Length; and thence be di&s;proportioned to
<PB N="xvii" REF="012243_0015_0F8A37B28D45F300">
the Faculties of tho&s;e, for whom it was intended. One &s;ingle chronical Di&s;ea&s;e might require as large a Volume as the pre&s;ent one.</P>
<P>But finally, were I to acknowledge, that this Compliance was both ne|ce&s;&s;ary and practicable, I declare I find it exceeds my Abilities; and that I am al&s;o far from having &s;ufficient Lei&s;ure for the Execution of it. It is my Wi&s;h that others would attempt it, and may &s;ucceed in accompli&s;hing it; but I hope the&s;e truly worthy Per&s;ons, who have honoured me by propo&s;ing the Atchievement of it to my&s;elf, will perceive the Rea&s;ons for my not complying with it, in all their Force; and not a&s;cribe a Refu&s;al, which ari&s;es from the very Nature of the thing, either to Ob&s;tinacy, or to any Want of an In|clination to oblige them.</P>
<P>I have been informed my Citations, or rather References, have puzzled &s;ome Readers. It was difficult to fore&s;ee this, but is ea&s;y to prevent it for the future. The Work contains Citations only of two Sorts; one, that points to the Remedies pre&s;cribed; and the other, which refers to &s;ome Pa&s;&s;age in the Book it&s;elf, that &s;erve to illu&s;trate tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages in which I cite. Neither of the&s;e References could have been omitted. The fir&s;t is marked thus, <HI>No.</HI> with the proper Figure to it, as <HI>1, 2,</HI> &amp;c. This &s;ignifies, that the Medicine I direct is de&s;cribed in the Table of Remedies, according to the Number annexed to that Character. Thus when we find directed, in any Page of the Book, the warm Infu&s;ion <HI>No. 1,</HI> in &s;ome other, the Pti&s;an <HI>No. 2</HI>; or in a third, the Almond Milk, or Emul&s;ion <HI>No. 4,</HI> it &s;ignifies, that &s;uch Pre&s;criptions will be found the Numbers <HI>1, 2,</HI> and 4; and this Table is printed at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ook.</P>
<P>If in&s;tead of forming this Table, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> thus referring to the Pre&s;crip|tions by their Numbers, I had repeated each Pre&s;cription as often as I di|rected it, this Treati&s;e mu&s;t have been doubled in Bulk, and in&s;ufferably tire&s;ome to peru&s;e. I mu&s;t repe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere, that what I have already &s;aid in the former Edition, that the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rea&s;ons for omitting the Prices <HI>here,</HI> may be &s;een Page 12 of this Tran&s;lation.</NOTE> Prices of the Medicines, or of a great Number of them, are tho&s;e at which the Apothecaries may afford them, without any Lo&s;s, to a Pea&s;ant in humble Circum&s;tances. But it &s;hould he remembered, that they are not &s;et down at the full Prices which they may hone&s;tly demand; &s;ince that would be unju&s;t for &s;ome to in&s;i&s;t on them at. Be&s;ides, there is no Kind of Tax in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> and I have no Right to impo&s;e one.</P>
<P>The Citations of the &s;econd Kind are very plain and &s;imple. The whole Work is divided into numbered Paragraphs di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Mark &sect;. And not to &s;well it with needle&s;s Repetitions, when in one Place I might have even pertinently repeated &s;omething already ob&s;erved, in&s;tead of &s;uch Repetition at Length, I have only referred to the Paragraph, where it had been ob&s;erved. Thus, for Example, when we read Page <HI>40, &sect; 50&mdash; When the Di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o circum&s;tanced as we have de&s;cribed, &sect; 46.</HI>&mdash;this imports that, not to repeat the De&s;cription already given, I refer the Reader to that la&s;t &sect; for it.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="012243_0016_0F8A37B34C7C6170">The U&s;e of the&s;e Citations is not the lea&s;t Innovation, and extremely com|modius and ea&s;y: but were there only a &s;ingle Reader likely to be puzzled by them I ought not to omit this Explanation of them, as I can expect to be generally u&s;eful, only in Proportion as I am clear: and it mu&s;t be obvi|ous, that a De&s;ire of being exten&s;ively u&s;eful is the &s;ole Motive of this Work. I have long &s;ince had the Happine&s;s of knowing, that &s;ome charitable and intelligent Per&s;ons have applied the Directions it contains, with extraordina|ry Succe&s;s, even in violent Di&s;ea&s;es: And I &s;hall arrive at the Height of my Wi&s;hes, if I continue to be informed, that it contributes to alleviate the Sufferings, and to prolong the Days, of my rational Fellow Creatures.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Decrea&s;e of the Number of Inhabitants, in mo&s;t of the States of Europe, is a Fact, which impre&s;&s;es e|very reflecting Per&s;on, and is become &s;uch a general Complaint, as is but too well e&s;tabli&s;hed on plain Cal|culations. This Decrea&s;e is mo&s;t remarkable in Country Places. It is owing to many Cau&s;es; and I &s;hall think my&s;elf happy, if I can contribute to remove one of the greate&s;t of them, which is the pernicious Manner of treating &s;ick People in Country Places. This is my &s;ole Object, tho' I may be excu&s;ed perhaps for pointing out the other concurring Cau&s;es, which may be all included with|in the&s;e two general Affirmations; That greater Numbers than u&s;ual emigrate from the Country; and that the People increa&s;e le&s;s every where.</P>
<P>There are many Sorts of Emigration. Some leave their Coun|try to enli&s;t in the Service of different States by Sea and Land; or to be differently employed abroad, &s;ome as Traders, others as Do|me&s;tics, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Military Service, by Land or Sea, prevents Population in vari|ous Re&s;pects. In the fir&s;t Place, the Numbers going abroad are always more, often <HI>much</HI> more, than tho&s;e who return. Gene|ral Battles, with all the Hazards and Fatigues of War; detach|ed Encounters, bad Provi&s;ions, Exce&s;s in drinking and eating; Di&s;ea&s;es that are the Con&s;equences of Debauches, the Di&s;orders that are peculiar to the Country; epidemical, pe&s;tilential or con|tagious Di&s;tempers, cau&s;ed by the unwhole&s;ome Air of Flanders, Holland, Italy and Hungary; long Crui&s;es, Voyages to the Ea&s;t or We&s;t Indies, to Guinea, &amp;c. de&s;troy a great Number of Men. The Article of De&s;ertion al&s;o, the Con&s;equences of which they dread on returning home, di&s;po&s;es many to abandon their Coun|try for ever. Others, on quitting the Service, take up with &s;uch E&s;tabli&s;hments, as it has occa&s;ionally thrown in their Way; and which nece&s;&s;arily prevent their Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n. But in the &s;econd Place, &s;uppo&s;ing they were all to come back, their Country &s;uffers equal|ly from their Ab&s;ence; as thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery generally happens during that Period of Life, when they are be&s;t adapted for Propagation; &s;ince that Qualification on their Return is impaired by Age, by Infirmities and Debauches: and even when they do marry, the
<PB N="2" REF="012243_0022_0F8A37B88BAE99C0">
Children often peri&s;h as Victims to the Exce&s;&s;es and Irregularities of their Fathers: they are weak, langui&s;hing, di&s;tempered, and either die young, or live incapable of being u&s;eful to Society. Be|&s;ides, that the prevailing Habit of Libertinage, which many have contracted, prevents &s;everal of them from marrying at all. But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e inconvenient Con&s;equences are real and notorious; yet as the Number of tho&s;e, who leave their Country on the&s;e Accounts, is limited, and indeed rather incon&s;iderable, if compared with the Number of Inhabitants which mu&s;t remain at home: as it may be affirmed too, that this relinqui&s;hing of their Country may have been even nece&s;&s;ary at &s;ome times, and may become &s;o again, if the Cau&s;es of Depopulation &s;hould cea&s;e, this Sort of Emigration is doubtle&s;s the lea&s;t grievous of any, and the la&s;t which may require a &s;trict Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>But that abandoning of their Country, or <HI>Expatriation,</HI> as it may be termed, the Object of which is a Change of the Emi|grant's Condition, is more to be con&s;idered, being more nume|rous. It is attended with many and peculiar Inconveniences, and is unhappily become an epidemical Evil, the Ravages of which are &s;till increa&s;ing; and that from one &s;imple and ridiculous Source, which is this; that the Succe&s;s of one Individual determines a hundred to run the &s;ame Ri&s;que, ninety and nine of whom may probably be di&s;appointed. They are &s;truck with the apparent Suc|ce&s;s of one, and are ignorant of the Mi&s;carriage of others. Sup|po&s;e a hundred Per&s;ons might have &s;et out ten Years ago, to <HI>&s;eek their Fortune,</HI> as the Saying is, at the End of &s;ix Months they are all forgotten, except by their Relations; but if one &s;hould return the &s;ame Year, with more Money than his own Fortune, more than he &s;et out with; or if one of them has got a moderate Place with little Work, the whole Country rings with it, as a Subject of general Entertainment. A Croud of young People are &s;educed by this and &s;ally forth, becau&s;e not one reflects, that of the ninety-nine, who &s;et out with the hundredth Per&s;on, one half has peri&s;h|ed, many are mi&s;erable, and the Remainder come back, without having gained any thing, but an Incapacity to employ them&s;elves u&s;efully at home, and in their former Occupations: and having deprived their Country of a great many Cultivators, who, from the Produce of the Lands, would have attracted con&s;iderable Sums of Money, and many comfortable Advantages to it. In &s;hort, the very &s;mall Proportion who &s;ucceed, are continually talked of; the Croud that &s;ink are perpetually forgot. This is a very great and real Evil, and how &s;hall it be prevented? It would be &s;ufficient perhaps to publi&s;h the extraordinary Ri&s;que, which may be ea&s;ily demon&s;trated: It would require nothing more, than to keep an exact yearly Regi&s;ter of all the&s;e Adventur|ers, and, at the Expiration of &s;ix, eight, or ten Years, to publi&s;h the Li&s;t, with the Fate of every Emigrant. I am greatly deceiv|ed, or at the End of a certain Number of Years, we &s;hould not &s;ee &s;uch Multitudes for&s;ake their native Soil, in which they might
<PB N="3" REF="012243_0023_0F8A37B94D60F128">
live comfortably by working, to go in Search of E&s;tabli&s;hments in others; the Uncertainty of which &s;uch Li&s;ts would demon&s;trate to them; and al&s;o prove, how preferable their Condition in their own Country would have been, to that they have been reduced to. People would no longer &s;et out, but on almo&s;t certain Advanta|ges: fewer would undoubtedly emigrate, more of whom, from that very Circum&s;tance, mu&s;t &s;ucceed. Meeting with fewer of their Country-men abroad, the&s;e fortunate few would oftener re|turn. By this Means more Inhabitants would remain in the Country, more would return again, and bring with them more Money to it. The State would be more populous, more rich and happy; as the Happine&s;s of a People who live on a fruitful Soil, depends e&s;&s;entially on a great Number of Inhabitants, with a mo|derate Quantity of pecuniary Riches.</P>
<P>But the Population of the Country is not only nece&s;&s;arily le&s;&s;en|ed, merely in Con&s;equence of the Numbers that leave it; &s;ince e|ven tho&s;e who remain increa&s;e le&s;s, than an equal Number for|merly did. Or, which amounts to the &s;ame thing, among the &s;ame Number of Per&s;ons, there are fewer Marriages than former|ly; and the &s;ame Number of Marriages produce fewer Chri&s;ten|ings. I do not enter upon a Detail of the Proofs, &s;ince merely looking about us mu&s;t furni&s;h a &s;ufficient Conviction of the Truth of them. What then are the Cau&s;es of this? There are two capi|tal ones, Luxury and Debauchery, which are Enemies to Popula|tion on many Accounts.</P>
<P>Luxury compels the wealthy Man, who would make a Figure; and the Man of a moderate Income, but who is his Equal in every other Re&s;pect, and who <HI>will</HI> imitate him, to be afraid of a numer|ous Family; the Education of which mu&s;t greatly contract that Expence he had devoted to Parade and O&s;tentation: And be&s;ides, if he mu&s;t divide his E&s;tate among a great many Children, each of them would have but a little, and be unable to keep up the State and the Train of the Father's. Since Merit is unju&s;tly e&s;timated by exterior Shew and Expence, one mu&s;t of cour&s;e endeavour to attain for him&s;elf, and to leave his Children in, a Situation capa|ble of &s;upporting that Expence. Hence the fewer Marriages of People who are not opulent, and the fewer Children among Peo|ple who marry.</P>
<P>Luxury is further prejudicial to the Increa&s;e of the People, in another Re&s;pect. The irregular Manner of Life which it intro|duces, depre&s;&s;es Health; it ruins the Con&s;titutions, and thus &s;en|&s;ibly affects Procreation. The preceding Generation counted &s;ome Families with more than twenty Children: the living one counts le&s;s than twenty Cou&s;ins. Very unfortunately this Way of thinking and acting, &s;o preventive of Increa&s;e, has extended it|&s;elf even into Villages: and they are no longer convinced there; that the Number of Children makes the Riches of the Country|man. Perhaps the next Generation will &s;carcely be acquainted with the Relation of Brotherhood.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="012243_0024_0F8A37BA0D99EB18">A third Inconvenience of Luxury is, that the Rich retreat from the Country to live in Cities; and by multiplying their Dome&s;tics there, they drain the former. This augmented Train is prejudi|cial to the Country, by depriving it of Cultivaters, and by dimi|ni&s;hing Population. The&s;e Dome&s;tics, being &s;eldom &s;ufficiently employed, contract the Habit of Lazine&s;s; and they prove inca|pable of returning to that Country Labour, for which Nature in|tended them. Being deprived of this Re&s;ource they &s;carcely ever marry, either from apprehending the Charge of Children, or from their becoming Libertines; and &s;ometimes, becau&s;e many Ma&s;|ters will not employ married Servants. Or &s;hould any of them marry, it is often in the Decline of Life, whence the State mu&s;t have the fewer Citizens.</P>
<P>Idlene&s;s of it&s;elf weakens them, and di&s;po&s;es them to tho&s;e De|bauches, which enfeeble them &s;till more. They never have more than a few Children, and the&s;e &s;ickly; &s;uch as have not Strength to cultivate the Ground; or who, being brought up in Cities, have an Aver&s;ion to the Country.</P>
<P>Even tho&s;e among them who are more prudent, who pre&s;erve their Morals, and make &s;ome Savings, being accu&s;tomed to a Ci|ty Life, and dreading the Labour of a Country one (of the Re|gulation of which they are al&s;o ignorant) chu&s;e to become little Merchants, or Trade&s;men; and this mu&s;t be a Drawback from Population, as any Number of Labourers beget more Children than an equal Number of Citizens; and al&s;o by Rea&s;on, that out of any given Number, more Children die in Cities, than in the Country.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Evils al&s;o prevail with Regard to Female Servants. After ten or twelve Years Servitude, the Maid-Servants in Cities cannot acquit them&s;elves as good Country Servants; and &s;uch of them as chu&s;e this Condition, quickly fail under that Kind or Quantity of Work, for which they are no longer con&s;tituted. Were we to &s;ee a Woman married in the Country, a Year after her leaving Town, it would be ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, how much that Way of living in the Country has broke her. Frequently their fir&s;t Child|bed, in which Term they have not all the Attendance their Deli|cacy demands, proves the Lo&s;s of their Health; they remain in a State of Langour, of Feeblene&s;s, and of Decay; they have no more Children; and this renders their Hu&s;bands unu&s;eful to|wards the Population of the State.</P>
<P>Abortions, Infants carried out of their Country after a con|cealed Pregnancy, and the Impo&s;&s;ibility of their Mother's getting Hu&s;bands afterwards, are frequently the Effects of their Liber|tinage.</P>
<P>It is to be apprehended too the&s;e bad Effects are rather increa&s;|ing with us; &s;ince, either for want of &s;ufficient Numbers, or from oeconomical Views, it has become a Cu&s;tom, in&s;tead of Women Servants, to employ Children, who&s;e Manners and who&s;e Con&s;ti|tutions are not yet formed; and who are ruined in the &s;ame Man|ner,

by their Re&s;idence in Town, by their Lazine&s;s, by bad Ex|amples, and bad Company.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s much remains &s;till un&s;aid on the&s;e important Heads; but be&s;ides my Intention not to &s;well this Treati&s;e immoderately, and the many Avocations, which prevent me from launching too far into what may be le&s;s within the Bounds of Medicine, I &s;hould be fearful of digre&s;&s;ing too far from my Subject. What I have hitherto &s;aid, however, I think cannot be wholly foreign to it; &s;ince in giving Advice to the People, with Regard to their Health, it was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;play to them the Cau&s;es which impaired it; though what I might be able to add further on this Head, would probably be thought more remote from the Subject.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add then but a &s;ingle Hint on the Occa&s;ion. Is it not practicable, in order to remedy tho&s;e Evils which we cannot prevent, to &s;elect &s;ome particular Part or Canton of the Coun|try, wherein we &s;hould endeavour by Rewards, 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> Irremo|vably to fix all the Inhabitants? 2<HI>dly.</HI> To encourage them by o|ther Rewards to a plentiful and legitimate Increa&s;e? They &s;hould not be permitted to go out of it, which mu&s;t prevent them from being expo&s;ed to the Evils I have mentioned. They &s;hould by no Means intermarry with any Strangers, who might introduce &s;uch Di&s;orders among them. Thus very probably this Canton, after a certain Time, would become even overpeopled, and might &s;end out Colonies to the others.</P>
<P>One Cau&s;e, &s;till more con&s;iderable than tho&s;e we have already mentioned, has, to this very Moment, prevented the Increa&s;e of the People in France. This is the Decay of Agriculture. The Inhabitants of the Country, to avoid &s;erving in the Militia; to e|lude the Days-Service impo&s;ed by their Lords, and the Taxes; and being attracted to the City by the Hopes of Intere&s;t, by La|zine&s;s and Libertinage, have left the Country nearly de&s;erted. Tho&s;e who remain behind, either not being encouraged to work, or not being &s;ufficient for what there is to do, content them&s;elves with cultivating ju&s;t as much as is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their Sub&s;i&s;tence. They have either lived &s;ingle, or married but late; or perhaps, after the Example of the Inhabitants of the Cities, they have refu&s;ed to fulfil their Duty to Nature, to the State, and to a Wife. The Country deprived of Tillers, by this Expatria|tion and Inactivity, has yielded nothing; and the Depopulation of the State has daily increa&s;ed, from the reciprocal and nece&s;&s;ary Proportion between Sub&s;i&s;tence and Population, and becau&s;e A|griculture alone can increa&s;e Sub&s;i&s;tence. A &s;ingle Compari&s;on will &s;ufficiently evince the Truth and the Importance of the&s;e Prin|ciples, to tho&s;e who have not &s;een them already divulged and de|mon&s;trated in the Works of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Marquis of Mirabeau.</NOTE> Friend of Man.</P>
<P><Q>An old Roman, who was always ready to return to the Cul|tivation of his Field, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted him&s;elf and his Family from one Acre of Land. A Savage who neither &s;ows nor cultivates, con&s;umes, in his &s;ingle Per&s;on, as much Game as require fifty
<PB N="6" REF="012243_0026_0F8A37BB94E021A8">
Acres to feed them. Con&s;equently <HI>Tullus Ho&s;tilius,</HI> on a thou|&s;and Acres, might have five thou&s;and Subjects; while a Savage Chief, limited to the &s;ame Extent of Territory, could &s;carcely have twenty: &s;uch an immen&s;e Di&s;proportion does A|griculture furni&s;h, in favour of Population. Ob&s;erve the&s;e two great Extremes. A State becomes di&s;peopled or peopled in that Proportion, by which it recedes from one of the&s;e Me|thods, and approaches to the other.</Q>
Indeed it is evident, that wherever there is an Augmentation of Sub&s;i&s;tence, an Increa&s;e of Population will &s;oon follow; which again will &s;till further fa|cilitate the Increa&s;e of Provi&s;ions. In a State thus circum&s;tanced Men will abound, who, after they have furni&s;hed &s;ufficient Num|bers for the Service of War, of Commerce, of Religion, and for Arts and Profe&s;&s;ions of every kind, will further al&s;o furni&s;h a Source for Colonies, who will extend the Name and the Pro&s;peri|ty of their Nation to di&s;tant Regions. There will en&s;ue a Plenty of Commodities, the Superfluity of which will be exported to other Countries, to exchange for other Commodities, that are not pro|duced at home; and the Balance, being received in Money, will make the Nation rich, re&s;pectable by its Neighbours, and happy. Agriculture, vigorou&s;ly pur&s;ued, is equal to the Production of all the&s;e Benefits; and the pre&s;ent Age will enjoy the Glory of re|&s;toring it, by &s;avouring and encouraging Cultivaters, and by forming Societies for the Promotion of Agriculture.</P>
<P>I proceed at length to the fourth Cau&s;e of Depopulation, which is the Manner of treating &s;ick People in the Country. This has often affected me with the deepe&s;t Concern. I have been a Wit|ne&s;s that Maladies, which, in them&s;elves, would have been gen|tle, have proved mortal from a pernicious Treatment: I am con|vinced that this Cau&s;e alone makes as great a Havock as the for|mer; and certainly it requires the utmo&s;t Attention of Phy&s;icians, who&s;e Duty it is to Labour for the Pre&s;ervation of Mankind. While we are employing our a&s;&s;iduous Cares on the more poli&s;hed and fa&s;hionable Part of them in Cities, the larger and more u&s;e|ful Moiety peri&s;h in the Country; either by particular, or by highly epidemical, Di&s;ea&s;es, which, within a few Years pa&s;t, have appeared in different Villages, and made no &s;mall Ravage. This afflicting Con&s;ideration has determined me to publi&s;h this little Work, which is &s;olely intended for tho&s;e Patients, who, by their Di&s;tance from Phy&s;icians, are deprived of their A&s;&s;i&s;tance. I &s;hall not give a Detail of my Plan, which is very &s;imple, in this Part; but content my&s;elf with affirming, I have u&s;ed my utmo&s;t Care to render it the mo&s;t u&s;eful I po&s;&s;ibly could: and I dare hope, that if I have not fully di&s;played its utmo&s;t Advantages, I have at lea&s;t &s;ufficiently &s;hewn tho&s;e pernicious Methods of treat|ing Di&s;ea&s;es, that &s;hould inconte&s;tably be avoided. I am tho|roughly convinced, the De&s;ign might be accompli&s;hed more com|pleatly than I have done it; but tho&s;e who are &s;o capable of, do not attempt, it: I happen to be le&s;s timid; and I hope that
<PB N="7" REF="012243_0027_0F8A37BC4D54EEF0">
thinking Per&s;ons will rather take it in good part of me, to have publi&s;hed a Book, the compo&s;ing of which is rather di&s;agreeable from its very Facility; from the minute Details, which however are indi&s;pen&s;able; and from the Impo&s;&s;ibility of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing any Part of it (con&s;i&s;tently with the Plan) to the Bottom of the Sub|ject; or of di&s;playing any new and u&s;eful Pro&s;pect. It may be Compared, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, to the Works of a &s;piritual Guide, who was to write a Catechi&s;m for little Children.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time I am not ignorant there have already been a few Books calculated for Country Patients, who are remote from Succour: but &s;ome of the&s;e though publi&s;hed with a very good Purpo&s;e, produce a bad Effect. Of this kind are all Collections of Receipts or Remedies, without the lea&s;t De&s;cription of the Di&s;|ea&s;e; and of cour&s;e without ju&s;t Directions for the Exhibition, or Application, of them. Such, for Example, is the famous Collection of Madam FOUQUET, and &s;ome more in the &s;ame manner. Some others approach towards my Plan; but many of them have taken in too many Di&s;tempers, whence they are be|come too voluminous. Be&s;ides, they have not dwelt &s;ufficiently upon the Signs of the Di&s;ea&s;es; upon their Cau&s;es; the general Regimen in them, and the Mi&s;management of them. Their Re|ceipts are not generally as &s;imple, and as ea&s;y to prepare, as they ought to be. In &s;hort, the greater Part of their Writers &s;eem, as they advanced, to have grown tired of their melancholy Ta&s;k, and to have hurried them out too expeditiou&s;ly. There are but two of them, which I mu&s;t name with Re&s;pect; and which being propo&s;ed on a Plan very like my own, are executed in a &s;uperior Manner, that merits the highe&s;t Acknowledgements of the Publick. One of the&s;e Writers is M. ROSEN, fir&s;t Phy&s;ician of the Kingdom of <HI>Swe|den</HI>; who, &s;ome Years &s;ince, employed his ju&s;t Reputation to ren|der the be&s;t Services to his Country Men. He has made them re|trench from the Almanacs tho&s;e ridiculous Tales; tho&s;e extraor|dinary Adventures; tho&s;e pernicious a&s;trological Injunctions, which there, as well as here, an&s;wer no End but that of keeping up Ignorance, Credulity, Super&s;tition, and the fal&s;e&s;t Prejudices on the intere&s;ting Articles of Health, of Di&s;ea&s;es, and of Reme|dies. He has al&s;o taken Care to publi&s;h &s;imple plain Treati&s;es on the mo&s;t popular Di&s;tempers; which he has &s;ub&s;tituted in the Place of the former Heap of Ab&s;urdities. The&s;e conci&s;e Works however, which appear annually in their Almanacs, are not yet tran&s;lated from the <HI>Swedi&s;h,</HI> &s;o that I was unqualified to make any Extracts from them. The other is the Baron VAN SWEITEN, fir&s;t Phy&s;ician to their Imperial Maje&s;ties, who, about two Years &s;ince, has effected for the U&s;e of the Army, what I now attempt for &s;ick People in the Country. Though my Work was greatly advanced, when I fir&s;t &s;aw his, I have taken &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages from it: and had our Plans been exactly alike, I &s;hould imagine I had done the Public more Service, by endeavouring to extend the Reading of his Book, than by publi&s;hing a new one. Neverthe|le&s;s,
<PB N="8" REF="012243_0028_0F8A37BE27C1FE68">
as he is &s;ilent on many Articles, of which I have treated dif|fu&s;ively; as he has treated of many Di&s;tempers, which did not come within my Plan; and has &s;aid nothing of &s;ome others which I could not omit; our two Works, without entering into the Par|ticulars of the &s;uperior Merit of the Baron's, are very different, with Regard to the Subject of the Di&s;ea&s;es: tho' in &s;uch as we have both con&s;idered, I account it an Honour to me to find, we have almo&s;t con&s;tantly proceeded upon the &s;ame Principles.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Work is by no means addre&s;&s;ed to &s;uch Phy&s;icians, as are thoroughly accompli&s;hed in their Profe&s;&s;ion; yet po&s;&s;ibly, be&s;ides my particular medical Friends, &s;ome others may read it. I beg the Favour of all &s;uch fully to con&s;ider the Intention, the Spirit, of the Author, and not to cen&s;ure him, as a Phy&s;ician, from the Compo&s;ition of this Book. I even advi&s;e them here ra|ther to forbear peru&s;ing it; as a Production that can teach them nothing. Such as read, in order to criticize, will find a much greater Scope for exerci&s;ing that Talent on the other Pamphlets I have publi&s;hed. It were certainly unju&s;t that a Performance, who&s;e &s;ole ab&s;tracted Object is the Health and Service of my Countrymen, &s;hould &s;ubject me to any di&s;agreeable Con&s;equen|ces: and a Writer may fairly plead an Exemption from any Se|verity of Cen&s;ure, who has had the Courage to execute a work, which cannot pretend to a Panegyric.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed thus much in general, I mu&s;t; enter into &s;ome Detail of tho&s;e Means, that &s;eem the mo&s;t likely to me, to facili|tate the beneficial Con&s;equences, which, I hope, may re&s;ult to o|thers, from my pre&s;ent Endeavours. I &s;hall afterwards give an Explanation of &s;ome Terms which I could not avoid u&s;ing, and which, perhaps, are not generally under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The Title of <HI>Advice to the People,</HI> was not &s;ugge&s;ted to me by an Illu&s;ion, which might per&s;uade me, this Book would become a Piece of Furniture, as it were, in the Hou&s;e of every Pea&s;ant. Nineteen out of twenty will probably never know of its Exi&s;tence. Many may be unable to read, and &s;till more unable to under|&s;tand, it, plain and &s;imple as it is. I have principally calculated it for the Peru&s;al of intelligent and charitable Per&s;ons who live in the Country; and who &s;eem to have, as it were, a Call from Pro|vidence, to a&s;&s;i&s;t their le&s;s intelligent poor Neighbours with their Advice.</P>
<P>It is obvious, that the fir&s;t Gentlemen I have my Eye upon, are the Clergy. There is not a &s;ingle Village, a Hamlet, nor even the Hou&s;e of an Alien in the Country, that has not a Right to the good Offices of &s;ome one of this Order: And I a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf there are a great Number of them, who, heartily affected with the Di&s;tre&s;s of their ailing Flocks, have wi&s;hed many hundred times, that it were in their Power to give their Pari&s;honers &s;ome bodily Help, at the very time they were di&s;po&s;ing them to pre|pare for Death; or &s;o far to Delay the Fatality of the Di&s;temper, that the Sick might have an Opportunity of living more religiou&s;|ly
<PB N="9" REF="012243_0029_0F8A37BEAF92A660">
afterwards. I &s;hall think my&s;elf happy, if &s;uch truly re&s;pecta|ble Eccle&s;ia&s;tics &s;hall find any Re&s;ources in this Performance, that may conduce to the Accompli&s;hment of their beneficent Intentions. Their Regard, their Love for their People; their frequent In|vitations to vi&s;it their principal Neighbours; their Duty to root out all unrea&s;onable Prejudices, and Super&s;tition; their Charity, their Learning; the Facility, with which their general Know|ledge in Phy&s;ics, qualifies them to comprehend thoroughly all the medical Truths, and Contents of this Piece, are &s;o many Argu|ments to convince me, that they will have the greate&s;t Influence to procure that Reformation, in the Admini&s;tration of Phy&s;ick, to poor Country People, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o de&s;irable an Ob|ject.</P>
<P>In the next Place, I dare a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf of the Concurrence of Gentlemen of Quality and Opulence, in their different Pari&s;hes and E&s;tates, who&s;e Advice is highly regarded by their Inferiors; who are &s;o powerfully, adapted to di&s;courage a wrong, and to promote a right Practice, of which they will ea&s;ily di&s;cern all the Advanta|ges. The many In&s;tances I have &s;een of their entering, with great Facility, into all the Plan and Conduct of a Cure; their Readi|ne&s;s and even Earne&s;tne&s;s to comfort the Sick in their Villages; and the Genero&s;ity with which they prevent their Nece&s;&s;ities, in|duce me to hope, from judging of tho&s;e I have not the Plea&s;ure to know, by the&s;e whom I have, that they will eagerly embrace an Opportunity of promoting a new Method of doing good in their Neighbourhood. Real Charity will apprehend the great Probability there is of doing Mi&s;chief, tho' with the be&s;t Inten|tion, for want of a proper Knowledge of material Circum&s;tances; and the very Fear of that Mi&s;chief may &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pend the Ex|erci&s;e of &s;uch Charity; notwith&s;tanding it mu&s;t &s;eize, with the mo&s;t humane Avidity, every Light that can contribute to its own beneficent Exertion.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Per&s;ons who are rich, or at lea&s;t in ea&s;y Circum&s;tan|ces, whom their Di&s;po&s;ition, their Employments, or the Nature of their Property, fixes in the Country, where they are happy in doing good, mu&s;t be delighted to have &s;ome proper Directions, for the Conduct and Effectuation of their charitable Intentions.</P>
<P>In every Village, where there are any Per&s;ons, of the&s;e three Conditions, they are always readily apprized of the Di&s;tempers in it, by their poor Neighbours coming to intreat a little Soup, Venice Treacle, Wines, Bi&s;cuits, or any thing they imagine ne|ce&s;&s;ary for their &s;ick Folks. In Con&s;equence of &s;ome Que&s;tions to the By&s;tanders, or of a Vi&s;it to the &s;ick Per&s;on, they will judge at lea&s;t of <HI>what kind</HI> the Di&s;ea&s;e is; and by their prudent Advice they may be able to prevent a Multitude of Evils. They will give them &s;ome Nitre in&s;tead of Venice Treacle; Barley, or &s;weet Whey, in lieu of Soup. They will advi&s;e them to have Recour&s;e to Gly&s;ters, or Bathings of their Feet, rather than to Wine; and order them Gruel rather than Bi&s;cuits. A Man would &s;carcely be|lieve,
<PB N="10" REF="012243_0030_0F8A37BF4C902BD8">
'till after the Expiration of a few Years, how much Good might be effected by &s;uch proper Regards, &s;o ea&s;ily comprehend|ed, and often repeated. At fir&s;t indeed there may be &s;ome Dif|ficulty in eradicating old Prejudices, and inveterately bad Cu&s;toms; but whenever the&s;e were removed, good Habits would &s;trike forth full as &s;trong Roots, and I hope that no Per&s;on would be inclined to de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>It may be unnece&s;&s;ary to declare, that I have more Expectation from the Care and Goodne&s;s of the Ladies, than from tho&s;e of their Spou&s;es, their Fathers or Brothers. A more active Charity, a more durable Patience, a more dome&s;tic Life; a Sagacity, which I have greatly admired in many Ladies both in Town and Coun|try, that di&s;po&s;es them to ob&s;erve, with great Exactne&s;s; and to unravel, as it were, the &s;ecret Cau&s;es of the Symptoms, with a Facility that would do Honour to very good Practitioners, and with a Talent adapted to engage the Confidence of the Patient: &mdash;All the&s;e, I &s;ay, are &s;o many characteri&s;tical Marks of their Vo|cation in this important and neighbourly Duty; nor are they a few, who fulfil it with a Zeal, that merits the highe&s;t Commenda|tion, and renders them excellent Models for the Imitation of others.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the Education of Youth, may al&s;o be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ufficiently intelligent to take &s;ome Part in this Work; and I am &s;atisfied that much Good might re&s;ult from their undertaking it. I heartily wi&s;h they would not only &s;tudy to <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h the Di&s;temper</HI> (in which the principal, but by no means an in&s;uperable, Difficulty con&s;i&s;ts; and to do which I hope I have con&s;iderably put them in the Way) but I would have them learn al&s;o the Manner of applying Remedies. Many of them &s;have; I have known &s;ome who bleed, and who have given Gly&s;ters very expertly. This however all may ea&s;ily learn; and perhaps it would not be imprudent, if the Art of bleeding well and &s;afely were reckoned a nece&s;&s;ary Qualification, when they are examined for their Employment. The&s;e Faculties, that of e&s;timating the De|gree of a Fever, and how to apply and to dre&s;s Bli&s;ters, may be of great U&s;e within the Neighbourhood of their Re&s;idence. Their Schools, which are not frequently over-crouded, employ but a few of their daily Hours; the greater Part of them have no Land to cultivate; and to what better U&s;e can they apply their Lei&s;ure, than to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Comfort of the Sick? The moderate Price of their Service may be &s;o a&s;certained, as to incommode no Per&s;on; and this little Emolument might render their own Situ|ation the more agreeable: be&s;ides which, the&s;e little Avocations might prevent their being drawn a&s;ide &s;ometimes, by Rea&s;on of their Facility and frequent Lei&s;ure, &s;o as to contract a Habit of drinking too often. Another Benefit would al&s;o accrue from ac|cu&s;toming them to this kind of Practice, which is, that being ha|bituated to the Care of &s;ick People, and having frequent Occa&s;i|ons to write, they would be the better qualified, in difficult Ca&s;es,
<PB N="11" REF="012243_0031_0F8A37C00B998738">
to advi&s;e with tho&s;e, who were thought further nece&s;&s;ary to be con&s;ulted.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, even among Labourers, there may be many, for &s;ome &s;uch I have known, who being endued with good natural Sen&s;e and Judgment, and abounding with Benevolence, will read this Book with Attention, and eagerly extend the Maxims and the Methods it recommends.</P>
<P>And finally I hope that many Surgeons, who are &s;pread about the Country, and who practice Phy&s;ic in their Neighbourhood, will peru&s;e it; will carefully enter into the Principles e&s;tabli&s;hed in it, and will conform to its Directions; tho' a little different perhaps from &s;uch as they may have hitherto practi&s;ed. They will perceive a Man may learn at any Age, and of any Per&s;on; and it may be hoped they will not think it too much Trouble, to reform &s;ome of their Notions in a Science, which is not properly within their Profe&s;&s;ion (and to the Study of which they were ne|ver in&s;tituted) by tho&s;e of a Per&s;on, who is &s;olely employed in it, and who has had many A&s;&s;i&s;tances of which they are deprived.</P>
<P>Midwives may al&s;o find their Attendance more efficacious, as &s;oon as they are thoroughly di&s;po&s;ed to be better informed.</P>
<P>It were heartily to be wi&s;hed, that the greater Part of them had been better in&s;tructed in the Art they profe&s;s. The In&s;tances of Mi&s;chief that might have been avoided, by their being better qualified, are frequent enough to make us with there may be no Repetition of them, which it may be po&s;&s;ible to prevent. No|thing &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible, when Per&s;ons in Authority are zealou&s;ly inclined to prevent every &s;uch Evil; and it is time they &s;hould be properly informed of one &s;o e&s;&s;entially hurtful to Society.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;criptions I have given con&s;i&s;t of the mo&s;t &s;imple Reme|dies, and I have adjoined the Manner of preparing them &s;o fully, that I hope no Per&s;on can be at any Lo&s;s in that Re&s;pect. At the &s;ame time, that no one may imagine they are the le&s;s u&s;eful and efficacious for their Simplicity, I declare, they are the &s;ame I or|der in the City for the mo&s;t opulent Patients. This Simplicity is founded in Nature: the Mixture, or rather the Confu&s;ion, of a Multitude of Drugs is ridiculous. If they have the very &s;ame Virtues, for what Purpo&s;e are they blended? It were more judi|cious to confine our&s;elves to that, which is the mo&s;t effectual. If their Virtues are different, the Effect of one de&s;troys, or le&s;&s;ens, the Effect of the other; and the Medicine cea&s;es to prove a Re|medy.</P>
<P>I have given no Direction, which is not very practicable and ea&s;y to execute; neverthele&s;s it will be di&s;cernible, that &s;ome few are not calculated for the Multitude, which I readily grant. However I have given them, becau&s;e I did not lo&s;e Sight of &s;ome Per&s;ons; who, tho' not &s;trictly of the Multitude, or Pea&s;antry, do live in the Country, and cannot always procure a Phy&s;ician as &s;oon, or for as long a Time, as they gladly would.</P>

But &s;hould the Price of the Medicine, however moderate, exceed the Circum&s;tances of the Sick, doubtle&s;s the Common Pur&s;e, or the Poors-Box will defray it. Moreover there are in many Country Places Noblemens Hou&s;es, &s;ome of whom charitably contribute an annual Sum towards buying of Medicines for poor Patients; without adding to which Sum, I would only intreat the Favour of each of them to alter the Objects of it, and to allow their &s;ick Neighbours the Remedies and the Regimen directed here, in&s;tead of &s;uch as they formerly di&s;tributed among them.</P>
<P>It may &s;till be objected, that many Country Places are very di&s;|tant from large Towns; from which Circum&s;tance a poor Pea|&s;ant is incapable of procuring him&s;elf a &s;ea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary Supply in his Illne&s;s. I readily admit, that in fact, there are many Villages very remote from &s;uch Places as Apothecaries re&s;ide in. Yet, if we except a few among the Mountains, there are but very few of them above three or four Leagues from &s;ome little Town, where there always lives &s;ome Surgeon, or &s;ome Vender of Drugs. Perhaps however, even at this Time, indeed, there may not be many thus provided; but they will take Care to fur|ni&s;h them&s;elves with &s;uch Materials, as &s;oon as they have a good Pro&s;pect of &s;elling them, which may con&s;titute a &s;mall, but new, Branch of Commerce for them. I have carefully &s;et down the Time, for which each Medicine will keep, without &s;poiling. There is a very frequent Occa&s;ion for &s;ome particular ones, and of &s;uch the School-ma&s;ters may lay in a Stock. I al&s;o imagine, if they heartily enter into my Views, they will furni&s;h them&s;elves with &s;uch Implements, as may be nece&s;&s;ary in the Cour&s;e of their Attendance. If any of them were unable to provide them&s;elves
<PB N="13" REF="012243_0033_0F8A37C18D468F40">
with a &s;ufficient Number of good Lancets, an <HI>Apparatus</HI> for Cup|ping, and a Gly&s;ter Syringe (for want of which la&s;t a Pipe and Bladder may be occa&s;ionally &s;ub&s;tituted) the Pari&s;h might pur|cha&s;e them, and the &s;ame In&s;truments might do for the &s;ucceed|ing School-ma&s;ter. It is hardly to be expected, that all Per&s;ons in that Employment would be able, or even inclined, to learn the Way of u&s;ing them with Addre&s;s; but one Per&s;on who did, might be &s;ufficient for whatever Occa&s;ions &s;hould occur in this Way in &s;ome contigious Villages; with very little Neglect of their Functions among their Scholars.</P>
<P>Daily In&s;tances of Per&s;ons, who come from different Parts to con&s;ult me, without being capable of an&s;wering the Que&s;tions I a&s;k them, and the like Complaints of many other Phy&s;icians on the &s;ame Account, engaged me to write the la&s;t Chapter of this Work. I &s;hall conclude this Introduction with &s;ome Remarks, nece&s;&s;ary to facilitate the Knowledge of a few Terms, which were unavoidable in the Cour&s;e of it.</P>
<P>The Pul&s;e commonly beats in a Per&s;on in good Health, from the Age of eighteen or twenty to about &s;ixty-&s;ix Years, between &s;ixty and &s;eventy Times in a Minute. It &s;ometimes comes &s;hort of this in old Per&s;ons, and in very young Children it beats quic|ker: until the Age of three or four Years the Difference amounts at lea&s;t to a third; after which it dimini&s;hes by Degrees.</P>
<P>An intelligent Per&s;on, who &s;hall often touch and attend to his own Pul&s;e, and frequently to other People's, will be able to judge, with &s;ufficient Exactne&s;s, of the Degree of a Fever in a &s;ick Per|&s;on. If the Strokes are but one third above their Number in a healthy State, the Fever is not very violent: which it is as often as it amounts to half as many more as in Health. It is very high|ly dangerous, and may be generally pronounced mortal, when there are two Strokes in the Time of one. We mu&s;t not however judge of the Pul&s;e &s;olely by its Quickne&s;s, but by its Strength or Weakne&s;s; its Hardne&s;s or Softne&s;s; and the Regularity or Ir|regularity of it.</P>
<P>There is no Occa&s;ion to define the &s;trong and the feeble Pul&s;e. The Strength of it generally affords a good Progno&s;tic, and, &s;uppo&s;ing it too &s;trong, it may ea&s;ily be lowered. The weak Pul&s;e is often very menacing.</P>
<P>If the Pul&s;e, in meeting the Touch, excites the Notion of a dry Stroke, as though the Artery con&s;i&s;ted of Wood, or of &s;ome Me|tal, we term it <HI>hard</HI>; the oppo&s;ite to which is called <HI>&s;oft,</HI> and ge|nerally promi&s;es better. If it be &s;trong and yet &s;oft, even though it be quick, it may be con&s;idered as a very hopeful Circum&s;tance. But if it is &s;trong and hard, that is commonly a Token of an In|flammation, and indicates Bleeding and the cooling Regimen. Should it be, at the &s;ame time, &s;mall, quick and hard, the Dan|ger is indeed very pre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>We call that Pul&s;e regular, a continued Succe&s;&s;ion of who&s;e Strokes are made in equal Intervals of Time; and in which In|tervals
<PB N="14" REF="012243_0034_0F8A37C24D7A64C8">
not a &s;ingle Stroke is wanting (&s;ince if that is its State, it is called an intermitting Pul&s;e.) The Beats or Pul&s;ations are al|&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;emble each other &s;o exactly in Quality too, that one is not &s;trong, and the next alternately feeble.</P>
<P>As long as the State of the Pul&s;e is promi&s;ing, and Re&s;piration or Breathing is free; when the Brain does not &s;eem to be greatly affected; while the Patient takes his Medicines, and they are at|tended with the Con&s;equence that was expected; and he both pre&s;erves his Strength pretty well, and continues &s;en&s;ible of his Situation, we may rea&s;onably hope for his Cure. As often as all, or the greater Number of the&s;e characterizing Circum&s;tances are wanting, he is in very con&s;iderable Danger.</P>
<P>The Stoppage of Per&s;piration is often mentioned in the Cour&s;e of this Work. We call the Di&s;charge of that Fluid which conti|nually pa&s;&s;es off through the Pores of the Skin, <HI>Tran&s;piration</HI>; and which, though invi&s;ible, is very con&s;iderable. For if a Per|&s;on in Health eats and drinks to the Weight of eight Pounds daily, he does not di&s;charge four of them by Stool and Urine to|gether, the Remainder pa&s;&s;ing off by in&s;en&s;ible Tran&s;piration. It may ea&s;ily be conceived, that if &s;o con&s;iderable a Di&s;charge is &s;topt, or con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened; and if this Fluid, which ought to tran&s;pire through the Skin, &s;hould be transferred to any in|ward Part, it mu&s;t occa&s;ion &s;ome dangerous Complaint. In fact this is one of the mo&s;t frequent Cau&s;es of Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>To conclude very briefly&mdash;All the Directions in the following Treati&s;e are &s;olely de&s;igned for &s;uch Patients, as cannot have the Attendance of a Phy&s;ician. I am far from &s;uppo&s;ing, they ought to exclude one, even in tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, of which I have treated in the fulle&s;t Manner: and the Moment a Phy&s;ician arrives, they ought to be laid a&s;ide. The Confidence repo&s;ed in him &s;hould be entire, or there &s;hould be none: the Succe&s;s of the E|vent is founded in that. It is his Province to judge of the Di&s;ea&s;e, to &s;elect Medicines again&s;t it; and it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee the Incon|veniences that may follow, from propo&s;ing to him to con&s;ult with any others, preferably to tho&s;e he may chu&s;e to con&s;ult with; on|ly becau&s;e they have &s;ucceeded in the Treatment of another Pa|tient, who&s;e Ca&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e to have been nearly the &s;ame with the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. This were much the &s;ame, as to order a Shoe|maker to make a Shoe for one Foot by the Pattern of another Shoe, rather than by the Mea&s;ure he has ju&s;t taken.<NOTE PLACE="foot">N. B. Though a great Part of this judicious Introduction is le&s;s applicable to the political Circum&s;tances of the Briti&s;h Empire, than to tho&s;e of the Govern|ment for which it was calculated; we think the good Sen&s;e and the unaffected Pa|trioti&s;m which animate it, will &s;upercede any Apology for our tran&s;lating it. &mdash; The &s;erious Truth is this, that a thorough Attention to Population &s;eems never to have been more expedient for our&s;elves, than after &s;o bloody and expen&s;ive, though &s;uch a glorious and &s;ucce&s;sful War, while our enterprizing Neighbours, who will never be our Friends, are &s;o earne&s;t to recruit their Numbers; to in|crea&s;e their Agriculture; and to force a Vent for their Manufactures, which can|not be con&s;iderably effected, without a &s;en&s;ible Detriment to our own. Be&s;ides which, the unavoidable Drain from the People here, towards an effectual Cul|tivation, Improvement, and Security of our Conque&s;ts, demands a further Con|&s;ideration. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE></P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I. Of the mo&s;t u&s;ual Cau&s;es of popular Maladies.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 1. THE mo&s;t frequent Cau&s;es of Di&s;ea&s;es commonly incident to Country People are, 1. Exce&s;&s;ive La|bour, continued for a very con&s;iderable Time.&mdash; Sometimes they &s;ink down at once in a State of Ex|hau&s;tion and Faintne&s;s, from which they &s;eldom re|cover: but they are oftener attacked with &s;ome in|flammatory Di&s;ea&s;e, as a Quin&s;ey, a Pleuri&s;y, or an Inflammation of the Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>There are two Methods of preventing the&s;e Evils: one is, to avoid the Cau&s;e which produces them; but this is frequently im|po&s;&s;ible. Another is, when &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive Labour has been una|voidable, to allay their Fatigue, by a free U&s;e of &s;ome temperate refre&s;hing Drink; e&s;pecially by &s;weet Whey, by Butter-milk, or by <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;uppo&s;es they are not greatly heated, as well as fatigued, by their La|bour or Exerci&s;e, in which Circum&s;tance free and &s;udden Draughts of cooling Li|quors might be very pernicious; and it evidently al&s;o &s;uppo&s;es tho&s;e Drinks to be thus given, rather in Summer than in very cold Weather, as the Juice of the unripe Grapes, and the other fre&s;h Fruits &s;ufficiently a&s;certain the Sea&s;on of the Year. We think the Addition of Vinegar to their Water will &s;carcely ever be nece&s;&s;ary in this or the adjoining I&s;land, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions. The Caution re|commended in this Note is indeed abundantly enforced by Dr. TISSOT, &sect; 4: but con&s;idering the Per&s;ons to whom this Work is more particularly addre&s;&s;ed, we were willing to prevent every Po&s;&s;ibility of a Mi&s;take, in &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;ometimes &s;o vital, a Point. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> Water, to a Quart of which a Wine-gla&s;s of Vinegar may
<PB N="16" REF="012243_0036_0F8A37C3CEB993B8">
be added; or in&s;tead of that, the expre&s;&s;ed Juice of Grapes not fully ripe, or even of Goo&s;beries or Cherries: which whole&s;ome and agreeable Liquors are refre&s;hing and cordial. I &s;hall treat a little lower, of inflammatory Di&s;orders. The Inanition or Emp|tine&s;s, though accompanied with Symptoms different from the former, has yet &s;ome Affinity to them, with Re&s;pect to their Cau&s;e, which is a kind of general Ex&s;iccation or Dryne&s;s. I have known &s;ome cured from this Cau&s;e by Whey, &s;ucceeded by tepid Baths, and afterwards by Cow's Milk; for in &s;uch Ca&s;es hot Medicines and high Nouri&s;hment are fatal.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. There is another Kind of Exhau&s;tion or Emptine&s;s, which may be termed real Emptine&s;s, and is the Con&s;equence of great Po|verty, the Want of &s;ufficient Nouri&s;hment, bad Food, unwhole|&s;ome Drink, and exce&s;&s;ive Labour. In Ca&s;es thus circum&s;tances, good Soups and a little Wine are very proper. Such hap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n however very &s;eldom in this Country: I believe they are frequent in &s;ome others, e&s;pecially in many Provinces of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 3. A &s;econd and very common Source of Di&s;orders ari&s;es, from Peoples' lying down and repo&s;ing, when very hot, in a cold Place. This at once &s;tops Per&s;piration, the Matter of which being thrown upon &s;ome internal Part, proves the Cau&s;e of many violent Di&s;ea&s;es, particularly of Quin&s;eys, Inflammations of the Brea&s;t, Pleuri&s;ies, and inflammatory Cholics. The&s;e Evils, from this Cau&s;e, may always be avoided by avoiding the Cau&s;e, which is one of tho&s;e that de&s;troy a great Number of People. However, when it has occurred, as &s;oon as the fir&s;t Symptoms of the Mala|dy are perceivable, which &s;ometimes does not happen till &s;everal Days after, the Patient &s;hould immediately be bled; his Legs &s;hould be put into Water moderately hot, and he &s;hould drink plentifully of the tepid Infu&s;ion marked No. 1. Such A&s;&s;i&s;tances frequently prevent the Increa&s;e of the&s;e Di&s;orders; which, on the contrary, are greatly aggravated, if hot Medicines are given to &s;weat the Patient.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. A third Cau&s;e is drinking cold Water, when a Per&s;on is extremely hot. This acts in the &s;ame Manner with the &s;econd; but its Con&s;equences are commonly more &s;udden and violent. I have &s;een mo&s;t terrible Examples of it, in Quin&s;eys, Inflammations of the Brea&s;t, Cholics, Inflammations of the Liver, and all the Parts of the Belly, with prodigious Swellings, Vomitings, Sup|pre&s;&s;ions of Urine, and inexpre&s;&s;ible Angui&s;h. The mo&s;t availa|ble Remedies in &s;uch Ca&s;es, from this Cau&s;e, are, a plentiful
<PB N="17" REF="012243_0037_0F8A37C5A8D3F720">
Bleeding at the On&s;et, a very copious Drinking of warm Water, to which one fifth Part of Whey &s;hould be added; or of the Pti&s;an No. 2, or of an Emul&s;ion of Almonds, all taken warm. Fomentations of warm Water &s;hould al&s;o be applied to the Throat, the Brea&s;t and Belly, with Gly&s;ters of the &s;ame, and a little Milk. In this Ca&s;e, as well as in the preceding one, (&sect; 3.) a <HI>Semicupium,</HI> or Half-bath of warm Water has &s;ometimes been attended with immediate Relief. It &s;eems really a&s;toni&s;hing, that labouring People &s;hould &s;o often habituate them&s;elves to this pernicious Cu&s;tom, which they know to be very dangerous even to their Bea&s;ts. There are none of them, who will not prevent their Hor|&s;es from drinking while they are hot; e&s;pecially if they are ju&s;t going to put them up. Each of them knows that if he lets them drink in that State, they might po&s;&s;ibly bur&s;t with it; neverthe|less he is not afraid of incurring the like Danger him&s;elf. How|ever, this is not the only Ca&s;e, in which the Pea&s;ant &s;eems to have more Attention to the Health of his Cattle, than to his own.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. The fourth Cau&s;e, which indeed affects every Body, but more particularly the Labourer, is, the Incon&s;tancy of the Wea|ther. We &s;hift all at once, many times a Day, from Heat to Cold, and from Cold to Heat, in a more remarkable Manner, and more &s;uddenly, than in mo&s;t other Countries. This makes Di&s;tempers from Defluction and Cold &s;o common with us: and it &s;hould make us careful to go rather a little more warmly cloathed, than the Sea&s;on may &s;eem to require; to have Recour&s;e to our Winter-cloathing early in Autumn, and not to part with it too early in the Spring. Prudent Labourers, who &s;trip while they are at Work, take care to put on their Cloaths in the Evening when they return home.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This good Advice is enforced in a Note, by the Editor of <HI>Lyons,</HI> who ob&s;erves, it &s;hould be &s;till more clo&s;ely attended to, in Places, where Rivers, Woods, or Mountains retain, as it were, a con&s;iderable Humidity; and where the Evenings are, in every Sea&s;on, cold and moi&s;t. It is a very proper Caution too in our own variable Climate, and in many of our Colonies in North <HI>America. K.</HI></NOTE> Tho&s;e, who from Negligence, are &s;atisfied with hang|ing them upon their Country Tools, frequently experience, on their Return, the very unhappy Effects of it. There are &s;ome, tho' not many Places, where the Air it&s;elf is unwhole&s;ome, more from its particular (Quality, than from its Changes of Tempera|ture, as at <HI>Villeneuve,</HI> and &s;till more at <HI>Noville,</HI> and in &s;ome other Villages &s;ituated among the Mar&s;hes which border on the <HI>Rhone.</HI> The&s;e Countries are particularly &s;ubject to intermitting Fevers, of which I &s;hall treat briefly hereafter.</P>
<P>&sect; 6. Such &s;udden Changes are often attended with great Show|ers of Rain, and even cold Rain, in the middle of a very hot day; when the Labourer who was bathed, as it were, in a hot Sweat, is at once moi&s;tened in cold Water; which occa&s;ions the &s;ame Di&s;tempers, as the &s;udden Tran&s;ition from Heat to Cold, and re|quires the &s;ame Remedies. If the Sun or a hot Air &s;ucceed imme|diately
<PB N="18" REF="012243_0038_0F8A37C6244F9BC8">
to &s;uch a Shower, the Evil is con&s;iderably lighter: but if the Cold continues, many are often greatly incommoded by it.</P>
<P>A Traveller is &s;ometimes thoroughly and unavoidably wet with Mud; the ill Con&s;equence of which is often incon&s;iderable, pro|vided he changes his Cloaths immediately when he &s;ets up. I have known fatal Pleuri&s;ies en&s;ue from omitting this Caution. Whenever the Body or the Limbs are wet, nothing can be more u&s;eful than bathing them in warm Water. If the Legs only have been wet, it may be &s;ufficient to bath them. I have radically, tho|roughly, cured Per&s;ons &s;ubject to violent Cholics, as often as their Feet were wet, by per&s;uading them to pur&s;ue this Advice. The Bath proves &s;till more effectual, if a little Soap be di&s;&s;olved in it.</P>
<P>&sect; 7. A fifth Cau&s;e, which is &s;eldom attended to, probably in|deed becau&s;e it produces le&s;s violent Con&s;equences, and yet is cer|tainly hurtful, is the common Cu&s;tom in all Villages, of having their Ditches or Dunghills directly under their Windows. Cor|rupted Vapours are continually exhaling from them, which in time cannot fail of being prejudicial, and mu&s;t contribute to pro|duce putrid Di&s;ea&s;es. Tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to the Smell, be|come in&s;en&s;ible of it: but the Cau&s;e neverthele&s;s, does not cea&s;e to be unwhole&s;omely active; and &s;uch as are unu&s;ed to it per|ceive the Impre&s;&s;ion in all its Force.</P>
<P>&sect; 8. There are &s;ome Villages, in which, after the Curtain Lines are era&s;ed, watery mar&s;hy Places remain in the Room of them. The Effect of this is &s;till more dangerous, becau&s;e that putrified Water, which &s;tagnates during the hot Sea&s;on, &s;uffers its Vapours to exhale more ea&s;ily, and more abundantly, than that in the Cur|tain Lines did. Having &s;et out for <HI>Pully le Grand</HI> in 1759, on Ac|count of an epidemical putrid Fever which raged there, I was &s;en&s;ible, on traver&s;ing the Village, of the Infection from tho&s;e Mar&s;hes; nor could I doubt of their being the Cau&s;e of this Di&s;|ea&s;e, as well as of another like it, which had prevailed there five Years before. In other Re&s;pects the Village is whole&s;omly &s;ituat|ed. It were to be wi&s;hed &s;uch Accidents were obviated by avoid|ing the&s;e &s;tagnated Places: or, at lea&s;t, by removing them and the Dunghills, as far as po&s;&s;ible from the Spot, where we live and lodge.</P>
<P>&sect; 9. To this Cau&s;e may al&s;o be added the Neglect of the Pea|&s;ants to air their Lodgings. It is well known that too clo&s;e an Air occa&s;ions the mo&s;t perplexing malignant Fevers; and the poor Country People breath no other in their own Hou&s;es. Their Lodgings, which are very &s;mall, and which notwith&s;tanding in|clo&s;e, (both Day and Night) the Father, Mother, and &s;even or eight Children, be&s;ides &s;ome Animals, are never kept open during &s;ix Months in the Year, and very &s;eldom during the other &s;ix. I have found the Air &s;o bad in many of the&s;e Hou&s;es, that I am per&s;uad|ed, if their Inhabitants did not often go out into the free open Air, they mu&s;t all peri&s;h in a little time. It is ea&s;y, however, to pre|vent all the Evils ari&s;ing from this Source, by opening the Win|dows
<PB N="19" REF="012243_0039_0F8A37C6CF9AACB8">
daily: &s;o very practicable a Precaution mu&s;t be followed with the happie&s;t Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>&sect; 10. I con&s;ider Drunkenne&s;s as a &s;ixth Cau&s;e, not indeed as producing epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es, but which de&s;troys, as it were, by Retail, at all times, and every where. The poor Wretches, who abandon them&s;elves to it, are &s;ubject to frequent Inflammations of the Brea&s;t, and to Pleuri&s;ies, which often carry them off in the Flower of their Age. If they &s;ometimes e&s;cape through the&s;e vi|olent Maladies, they &s;ink, a long time before the ordinary Ap|proach of old Age, into all its Infirmities; and e&s;pecially into an A&s;thma, which terminates in a Drop&s;y of the Brea&s;t. Their Bo|dies worn out by Exce&s;s, do not comply and concur, as they ought, with the Force or Operation of Remedies; and Di&s;ea&s;es of Weak|ne&s;s, re&s;ulting from this Cau&s;e, are almo&s;t always incurable. It &s;eems happy enough, that Society lo&s;es nothing in parting with the&s;e Subjects, who are a Di&s;honour to it; and who&s;e brutal Souls are, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, dead, long before their Carca&s;es.</P>
<P>&sect; 11. The Provi&s;ions of the common People are al&s;o frequently one Cau&s;e of popular Maladies. This happens 1&s;t, whenever the Corn, not well ripened, or not well got in, in bad<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus I have ventured to tran&s;late <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> (<HI>Summers</HI>) to apply it to this and the neighbouring I&s;lands. Their Harve&s;ts in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland</HI> perhaps are earlier, and may occur in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and that of &s;ome particular Grain, probably &s;till earlier. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Harve&s;ts,</HI> has contracted an unwhole&s;ome Quality. Fortunately however this is &s;eldom the Ca&s;e; and the Danger attending the U&s;e of it may be le&s;&s;ened by &s;ome Precautions, &s;uch as tho&s;e of wa&s;hing and drying the Grain compleatly; of mixing a little Wine with the Dough, in kneading it; by allowing it a little more Time to &s;well or ri&s;e, and by baking it a little more. 2dly, The fairer and better &s;aved Part of the Wheat is &s;ometimes damaged in the Farmer's Hou&s;e: either becau&s;e he does not take due Care of it, or becau&s;e he has no convenient Place to pre&s;erve it, only from one Summer to the next. It has often happened to me, on enter|ing one of the&s;e bad Hou&s;es to be &s;truck with the Smell of Wheat that has been &s;poiled. Neverthele&s;s, there are known and ea&s;y Methods to provide again&s;t this by a little Care; though I &s;hall not enter into a Detail of them.

A hardy Labourer is not immediately &s;en&s;ible of the bad Influence of this moi&s;t and mar&s;hy Habitation; but they ope|rate at the long Run, and I have abundantly ob&s;erved their mo&s;t evident bad Effects, e&s;pecially on Women in Child-bed, on Chil|dren, and in Per&s;ons recovering of a preceding Di&s;ea&s;e.

This Object, perhaps, may well de&s;erve the Attention of the Pub|lick; and I earne&s;tly advi&s;e as many as do build, to ob&s;erve the nece&s;&s;ary Precautions on this Head. Another, which would co&s;t &s;till le&s;s Trouble, is to give the Front of their Hou&s;es an Expo&s;ure to the South-Ea&s;t.

<P>When Water is unclean and turbid, it is generally &s;ufficient to let it &s;ettle in order to clear it&s;elf, by dropping its Sediment.

When this Agitation is over, the Sand, in falling to the Bottom of the Ve&s;&s;el, will attract &s;ome of the Foulne&s;s &s;u&s;pended in the Water. Or, which is &s;till better, and very ea&s;y to do, two large Ve&s;&s;els may be &s;et near together, one of which &s;hould be placed con&s;iderably higher than the other.

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. Of the Cau&s;es which aggravate the Di&s;ea&s;es of the People. General Con&s;iderations.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 14. THE Cau&s;es already enumerated in the fir&s;t Chapter oc|ca&s;ion Di&s;ea&s;es; and the bad Regimen, or Conduct of the People, on the Inva&s;ion of them, render them &s;till more perplexing, and very often mortal.</P>
<P>There is a prevailing Prejudice among them, which is every Year attended with the Deaths of &s;ome Hundreds in this Country, and it is this &mdash;That all Di&s;tempers are cured by Sweat; and that to procure Sweat, they mu&s;t take Abundance of hot and heating things, and keep them&s;elves very hot. This is a Mi&s;take in both Re&s;pects, very fatal to the Population of the State; and it can|not be too much inculcated into Country People; that by thus en|deavouring to force Sweating, at the very Beginning of a Di&s;ea&s;e, they are, with great Probability, taking Pains to kill them&s;elves. I have &s;een &s;ome Ca&s;es, in which the continual Care to provoke this Sweating, has as manife&s;tly killed the Patient, as if a Ball had been &s;hot through his Brains; as &s;uch a precipitate and untimely Di&s;charge carries off the thinner Part of the Blood, leaving the Ma&s;s more dry more vi&s;cid and inflamed. Now as in all acute Di&s;ea&s;es (if we except a very few, and tho&s;e too much le&s;s frequent) the Blood is already too thick; &s;uch a Di&s;charge mu&s;t evidently increa&s;e the Di&s;order, by co-operating with its Cau&s;e. In&s;tead of forcing out the watery, the thinner Part of the Blood, we &s;hould rather endeavour to increa&s;e it. There is not a &s;ingle Pea&s;ant per|haps who does not &s;ay, when he has a Pleuri&s;y, or an Inflamma|tion of his Brea&s;t, that his Blood is too thick, and that it cannot circulate. On &s;eeing it in the Ba&s;on after Bleeding, he finds it
<PB N="24" REF="012243_0044_0F8A37CA8B6E9ED8">
<HI>black, dry, burnt</HI>; the&s;e are his very Words. How &s;trange is it then, that common Sen&s;e &s;hould not a&s;&s;ure him, that, far from forcing out the <HI>Serum,</HI> the watery Part, of &s;uch a Blood by &s;weat|ing, there is a Nece&s;&s;ity to increa&s;e it?</P>
<P>&sect; 15. But &s;uppo&s;ing it were as certain, as it is erroneous, that Sweating was beneficial at the Beginning of Di&s;ea&s;es, the Means which they u&s;e to excite it would not prove the le&s;s fatal. The fir&s;t Endeavour is, to &s;tifle the Patient with the Heat of a clo&s;e A|partment, and a Load of Covering. Extraordinary Care is taken to prevent a Breath of fre&s;h Air's getting into the Room; from which Circum&s;tance, the Air already in it is &s;peedily and extreme|ly corrupted; and &s;uch a Degree of Heat is procured by the Weight of the Patient's Bed-cloaths, that the&s;e two Cau&s;es alone are &s;ufficient to excite a mo&s;t ardent Fever, and an Inflammation of the Brea&s;t, even in a healthy Man. More than once have I found my&s;elf &s;eized with a Difficulty of breathing, on entering &s;uch Chambers, from which I have been immediately relieved, on obliging them to open all the Windows. Per&s;ons of Educa|tion mu&s;t find a Plea&s;ure, I conceive, in making People un|der&s;tand on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, which are &s;o frequent, that the Air being more indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to us, if po&s;&s;ible, than Water is to a Fi&s;h, our Health mu&s;t immediately &s;uffer, whenever that cea&s;es to be pure; and in a&s;&s;uring them al&s;o, that nothing cor|rupts it &s;ooner than tho&s;e Vapours, which continually &s;team from the Bodies of many Per&s;ons inclo&s;ed within a little Chamber, from which the Air is excluded. The Ab&s;urdity of &s;uch Conduct is a &s;elf-evident Certainty: let in a little fre&s;h Air on the&s;e mi&s;er|able Patients, and le&s;&s;en the oppre&s;&s;ing Burthen of their Coverings, and you generally &s;ee upon the Spot, their Fever and Oppre&s;&s;ion, their Angui&s;h and Raving, to abate.</P>
<P>&sect; 16. The &s;econd Method taken to rai&s;e a Sweat in the&s;e Pa|tients is, to give them nothing but hot things, e&s;pecially Venice Treacle, Wine, or &s;ome <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Word, which mu&s;t be of <HI>German,</HI> not of <HI>French,</HI> Extraction, &s;trictly &s;ignifies, <HI>Drink for a Fall,</HI> as we &s;ay <HI>Pulvis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;um,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>&sect; 17. But I &s;hall be told perhaps, that Di&s;ea&s;es are often car|ried off by Sweat, and that we ought to be guided by Experience. To this I an&s;wer, it is very true, that Sweating cures &s;ome parti|cular Di&s;orders, as it were, at their very On&s;et; for In&s;tance, tho&s;e Stitches that are called &s;purious or fal&s;e Pleuri&s;ies, &s;ome rheuma|tic Pains, and &s;ome Colds or De&s;tructions. But this only happens when the Di&s;orders depend &s;olely and &s;imply on &s;topt or abated Per&s;piration, to which &s;uch Pain in&s;tantly &s;ucceeds; where im|mediately, before the Fever has thickened the Blood, and inflam|ed the Humours; and where before any internal Infarction, any Load is formed, &s;ome warm Drinks are given, &s;uch as <HI>Faltranc</HI> and Honey; which, by re&s;toring Tran&s;piration, remove the very Cau&s;e of the Di&s;order. Neverthele&s;s, even in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, great Care &s;hould be had not to rai&s;e too violent a Commotion in the Blood, which would rather re&s;train, than promote Sweat; to ef|fect which Elder-flowers are in my Opinion preferable to <HI>Faltranc.</HI> Sweating is al&s;o of Service in Di&s;ea&s;es, when their Cau&s;es are ex|tingui&s;hed, as it were, by plentiful Dilution: then indeed it re|lieves, by drawing off, with it&s;elf, &s;ome Part of the di&s;tempered Humours; which being affected, their gro&s;&s;er Parts have pa&s;&s;ed off by Stool and by Urine: be&s;ides which, the Sweat has al&s;o &s;erved to carry off that extraordinary Quantity of Water, we were obliged to convey into the Blood, and which was become &s;uper|fluous there. Under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, and at &s;uch a Juncture, it is of the utmo&s;t Importance indeed, not to check the Sweat, whether by Choice, or for Want of Care. There might often be as much Danger in doing this, as there would have been in en|devouring to force a Sweat, immediately upon the Inva&s;ion of the Di&s;order; &s;ince the arre&s;ting of this Di&s;charge, under the preceding Circum&s;tances, might frequently occa&s;ion a more dan|gerous Di&s;temper, by repelling the Humours on &s;ome inward vi|tal Part. As much Care therefore &s;hould be taken not to check, imprudently, that Evacuation by the Skin, which naturally oc|curs towards the Conclu&s;ion of Di&s;ea&s;es, as not to force it at their Beginning; the former being almo&s;t con&s;tantly beneficial, the lat|ter as con&s;tantly pernicious. Be&s;ides, were it even nece&s;&s;ary, it might be very dangerous to force it violently; &s;ince by heating the Patients greatly, a vehement Fever is excited; they become &s;corched up in a Manner, and the Skin proves extremely dry. Warm Water, in &s;hort, is the be&s;t of Sudorifics.</P>
<P>If the Sick are &s;weated very plentifully for a Day or two, which may make them ea&s;ier for &s;ome Hours, the&s;e Sweats &s;oon terminate, and cannot be excited again by the &s;ame Medicines. The Do&s;e thence is doubled, the Inflammation is increa&s;ed, and the Patient

expires in terrible Angui&s;h, with all the Marks of a general In|flammation. His Death is a&s;cribed to his Want of Sweating; when it really was the Con&s;equence of his Sweating too much at fir&s;t; and of his taking Wine and hot Sudorifics. An able <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Phy&s;ician had long &s;ince a&s;&s;ured his Countrymen that Wine was fatal to them in Fevers; I take leave to repeat it again and again, and wi&s;h it may not be with as little Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Our Country Folks, who in Health, naturally di&s;like red Wine, prefer it when Sick; which is wrong, as it binds them up more than white Wine. It does not promote Urine as well; but in|crea&s;es the Force of the circulating Arteries, and the Thickne&s;s of the Blood, which were already too con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>&sect; 18. Their Di&s;ea&s;es are al&s;o further aggravated by the Food that is generally given them. They mu&s;t undoubtedly prove weak, in Con&s;equence of their being &s;ick; and the ridiculous Fear of the Patient's dying of Weakne&s;s, di&s;po&s;es their Friends to force them to eat; which, increa&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir Di&s;order, renders the Fever mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">al.

Whatever &s;olid Food is taken corrupts, and proves a Source of Putridity, which adds nothing to the Strength of the Sick, but greatly to that of the Di&s;temper. There are in fact a thou&s;and Examples to prove, that it becomes a real Poi&s;on: and we may &s;en&s;ibly perceive that the&s;e poor Creatures, who are thus com|pelled to eat, lo&s;e their Strength, and fall into Anxiety and Rav|ings, in Proportion as they &s;wallow.</P>
<P>&sect; 20. They are al&s;o further injured by the Quality, as well as the Quantity of their Food. They are forced to &s;up &s;trong gra|vey Soups, Eggs, Bi&s;cuits, and even Fle&s;h, if they have but ju&s;t Strength and Re&s;olution to chew it. It &s;eems ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for them to &s;urvive all this Tra&s;h. Should a Man in perfect Health be compelled to eat &s;tinking Meat, rotten Eggs, &s;tale &s;our Broth, he is attacked with as violent Symptoms, as if he had taken real Poi&s;on, which, in Effect, he has. He is &s;eized with Vomiting, Angui&s;h, a violent Purging, and a Fever, with Raving and erup|tive Spots, which we call the Purple Fever. Now when the very &s;ame Articles of Food, in their &s;ounde&s;t State, are given to a Per&s;on in a Fever, the Heat and the morbid Matter already in his Stomach, quickly putrify them; and after a few Hours produce all the above mentioned Effects. Let any Man judge then, if the lea&s;t Service can be expected from them.</P>
<P>&sect; 21. It is a Truth e&s;tabli&s;hed by the fir&s;t of Phy&s;icians, above two thou&s;and Years pa&s;t, and &s;till further ratified by his Succe&s;&s;ors, that as long as a &s;ick Per&s;on has a bad Humour or Ferment in his
<PB N="27" REF="012243_0047_0F8A6B499812D780">
Stomach, his Weakne&s;s increa&s;es, in Proportion to the Food he receives. For this being corrupted by the infected Matter it meets there, proves incapable of nouri&s;hing, and becomes a conjunct or additional Cau&s;e of the Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t ob&s;erving Per&s;ons con&s;tantly remark<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t whenever a feveri&s;h Patient &s;ups, what is commonly called &s;ome good Broth, the Fever gathers Strength and the Patient Weakne&s;s. The giv|ing &s;uch a Soup or Broth, though of the fre&s;he&s;t &s;ounde&s;t Meat, to a Man who has a high Fever, or putrid Humours in his Sto|mach, is to do him exactly the &s;ame Service, as if you had given him (two or three Hours later) &s;tale putrid Soup.</P>
<P>&sect; 22. I mu&s;t al&s;o affirm, that this fatal Prejudice, of keeping up the Patient's Strength by Food, is &s;till too much propagated, even among tho&s;e very Per&s;ons, who&s;e Talents and who&s;e Edu|cation might be expected to exempt them from any &s;uch gro&s;s Er|ror. It were happy for Mankind, and the Duration of their Lives would generally be more extended, if they could be thoroughly per&s;uaded of this medical, and &s;o very demon&s;trable, Truth;&mdash; &mdash;That the only things which can &s;trengthen &s;ick Per&s;ons are tho&s;e which are able to weaken their Di&s;ea&s;e; but their Ob&s;tinacy in this Re&s;pect is inconceivable; it is another Evil &s;uperadded to that of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;ometimes the more grievous one. Out of twen|ty &s;ick Per&s;ons, who are lo&s;t in the Country, more than two Thirds might often have been cured, if being only lodged in a Place defended from the Injuries of the Air, they were &s;upplied with Abundance of good Water. But that mo&s;t mi&s;taken Care and Regimen I have been treating of, &s;carcely &s;uffers one of the twenty to &s;urvive them.</P>
<P>&sect; 23. What further increa&s;es our Horror at this enormous Pro|pen&s;ity to heat, dry up, and cram the Sick is, that it is totally oppo&s;ite to what Nature her&s;elf indicates in &s;uch Circum&s;tances. The burning Heat of which they complain; the Dryne&s;s of the Lips, Tongue and Throat; the flaming high Colour of their U|rine; the great Longing they have for cooling things; the Plea|&s;ure and &s;en&s;ible Benefit they enjoy from fre&s;h Air, are &s;o many Signs or rather Proofs, which cry out with a loud Voice, that we ought to attemperate and cool them moderately, by all means. Their &s;oul Tongues, which &s;hew the Stomach to be in the like Condition; their Loathing, their Propen&s;ity to vomit, their utter Aver&s;ion to all &s;olid Food, and e&s;pecially to Fle&s;h; the di&s;agreea|ble Stench of their Breath; their Di&s;charge of fetid Wind up|wards and downwards, and frequently the extraordinary Offen|&s;ivene&s;s of their Excrements, demon&s;trate that their Bowels are full of putrid Contents, which mu&s;t corrupt all the Aliments &s;u|peradded to them: and that the only thing which can prudent|ly be done, is to dilute and attemper them by plentiful Draughts of refre&s;hing cooling Drinks, which may promote an ea&s;y Di&s;charge of them. I affirm it again, and I heartily wi&s;h it may be tho|roughly attended to, that as long as there is any Ta&s;te of Bitter|ne&s;s,
<PB N="28" REF="012243_0048_0F8A6B49E636CA88">
or of Putre&s;ence; as long as there is a <HI>Nau&s;ea</HI> or Loathing, a bad Breath, Heat and Feveri&s;hne&s;s, with fetid Stools, and little and high coloured Urine; &s;o long all Fle&s;h and Fle&s;h-Soup, Eggs, and all kinds of Food compo&s;ed of them, or of any of them, and all Venice Treacle, Wine, and all heating things are &s;o many ab&s;olute Poi&s;ons.</P>
<P>&sect; 24. I may po&s;&s;ibly be cen&s;ured as extravagant and exce&s;&s;ive on the&s;e Heads by the Publick, and even by &s;ome Phy&s;icians: but the true and enlightened Phy&s;icians, tho&s;e who attend to the Ef|fects of every Particular, will find on the contrary, that far from exceeding in this Re&s;pect, I have rather feebly expre&s;&s;ed their own Judgment, in which they agree with that of all the good ones, who have exi&s;ted within more than two thou&s;and Years; that very Judgment which Rea&s;on approves, and continual Experience con|firms. The Prejudices I have been contending again&s;t have co&s;t <HI>Europe</HI> &s;ome Millions of Lives.</P>
<P>&sect; 25. Neither &s;hould it be omitted, that even when a Patient has very fortunately e&s;caped Death, notwith&s;tanding all this Care to obtain it, the Mi&s;chief is not ended; the Con&s;equences of the high Aliments and heating Medicines being, to leave behind the Seed, the Principle, of &s;ome low and chronical Di&s;ea&s;e; which increa&s;ing in&s;en&s;ibly, bur&s;ts out at length, and finally procures him the Death he has even wi&s;hed for, to put an End to his te|dious Sufferings.</P>
<P>&sect; 26. I mu&s;t al&s;o take Notice of another dangerous common Practice; which is that of purging, or vomiting a Patient, at the very Beginning of a Di&s;temper. Infinite Mi&s;chiefs are occa&s;ioned by it. There are &s;ome Ca&s;es indeed, in which gently evacuating Medicines, at the Beginning of a Di&s;ea&s;e, are convenient, and e|ven nece&s;&s;ary. Such Ca&s;es &s;hall be particularly mentioned in &s;ome other Chapters: but as long as we are unacquainted with them, it &s;hould be con&s;idered as a general Rule, that they are hurtful at the Beginning; this being true very often; and always, when the Di&s;ea&s;es are &s;trictly inflammatory.</P>
<P>&sect; 27. It is hoped by their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, at that Time, to remove the Load and Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Stomach, the Cau&s;e of a Di&s;po&s;i|tion to vomit, of a dry Mouth, of Thir&s;t, and of much Unea&s;i|ne&s;s; and to le&s;&s;en the Leaven or Ferment of the Fever. But in this Hope they are very often deceived; &s;ince the Cau&s;es of the&s;e Symptoms are &s;eldom of a Nature to yield to the&s;e Evacuations. By the extraordinary Vi&s;cidity or Thickne&s;s of the Humours, that &s;oul the Tongue, we &s;hould form our Notions of tho&s;e, which line the Stomach and the Bowels. It may be wa&s;hed, gargled and even &s;craped, to very little good Purpo&s;e. It does not hap|pen until the Patient has drank for many Days, and the Heat, the Fever, and the great Sizine&s;s of the Humours are abated, that this Filth can be thoroughly removed, which by Degrees &s;eparates of it&s;elf. The State of the Stomach being conformable to that of the Tongue, no Method can effectually &s;cour and clean it at the
<PB N="29" REF="012243_0049_0F8A6B4AADA12700">
Beginning: but by giving refre&s;hing and diluting Remedies plen|tifully, it gradually frees it&s;elf; and the Propen&s;ity to vomit, with its other Effects and Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, go off naturally and without Purges.</P>
<P>&sect; 28. Neither are the&s;e Evacuations only negatively wrong, merely from doing no Good; for con&s;iderable Evil po&s;itively en|&s;ues from the Application of tho&s;e acrid irritating Medicines, which increa&s;e the Pain and Inflammation; drawing the Humours upon tho&s;e Parts that were already overloaded with them; which by no means expel the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, that not being at this Time fitted for Expul&s;ion, as not &s;ufficiently concocted or ripe: and yet which Evacuations, at the &s;ame Time, di&s;charge the thin|ne&s;t Part of the Blood, whence the Remainder becomes more thick; in &s;hort which carry off the u&s;eful, and leave the hurtful Humours behind.</P>
<P>&sect; 29. The Vomit e&s;pecially, being given in an inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;e, and even without any Di&s;tinction in all acute ones, be|fore the Humours have been dimini&s;hed by Bleeding, and diluted by plentiful &s;mall Drinks, is productive of the greate&s;t Evils; of Inflammations of the Stomach, of the Lungs and Liver, of Suffo|cations and Frenzies. Purges &s;ometimes occa&s;ion a general In|flammation of the Guts, which <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is pretty common to <HI>bear</HI> of Per&s;ons recovering from Inflammations of the Bowels, or Guts, which our Author more ju&s;tly and ingenuou&s;ly con&s;iders as general Pa&s;&s;ports to Death: for it is difficult to conceive, that a real and <HI>con|&s;iderable</HI> Inflammation of &s;uch thin, membranous, irritable Parts, lined with &s;uch putre&s;cent Humours and Contents, and in &s;o hot and clo&s;e a Situation, could be re&s;tored to a &s;ound and healthy State <HI>as often</HI> as Rumour affirms it. This makes it &s;o important a Point, to avert every Tendency to an Inflamma|tion of the&s;e feculent Parts, as to ju&s;tify a Bleeding directed, &s;olely, from this Precaution; and which might have been no otherwi&s;e indicated by a Di&s;ea&s;e, at|tended with any Symptom, that threatened &s;uch an Inflammation. But when a Per&s;on recovers, there can be no anatomical Search for &s;uch Inflammations, or their Effects, the real or imaginary Cure of which may well amaze the Patient, and mu&s;t greatly redound to the Honour of his Pre&s;criber; &s;o that there may be Policy &s;ometimes in giving a moderate Di&s;ea&s;e a very bad Name. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> terminates in Death. Some In|&s;tances of each of the&s;e terrible Con&s;equences have I &s;een, from blundering Temerity, Imprudence and Ignorance. The Effect of &s;uch Medicines, in the&s;e Circum&s;tances, are much the &s;ame with tho&s;e we might rea&s;onably expect, from the Application of Salt and Pepper to a dry, inflamed and foul Tongue, in order to moi|&s;ten and clean it.</P>
<P>&sect; 30. Every Per&s;on of &s;ound plain Sen&s;e is capable of percei|ving the Truth of whatever I have advanced in this Chapter: and there would be &s;ome Degree of Prudence, even in tho&s;e who do not perceive the real good Tendency of my Advice, not to de|fy nor oppo&s;e it too hardily. The Que&s;tion relates to a very im|portant Object; and in a matter quite foreign to them&s;elves, they undoubtedly owe &s;ome Deference to the Judgment of Per&s;ons, who have made it the Study and Bu&s;ine&s;s of their whole Lives.

It is not to my&s;elf that I hope for their Attention, but to the greate&s;t Phy&s;icians, who&s;e feeble In&s;trument and Eccho I am.&mdash; What Intere&s;t have any of us in forbidding &s;ick People to eat, to be &s;tifled, or to drink &s;uch heating things as heighten their Fever? What Advantage can accrue to us from oppo&s;ing the fatal Tor|rent, which &s;weeps them off? What Arguments can per&s;uade People, that &s;ome thou&s;and Men of Genius, of Knowledge, and of Experience, who pa&s;s their Lives among a Croud and Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of Patients; who are entirely employed to take Care of them, and to ob&s;erve all that pa&s;&s;es, have been only amu&s;ing and deceiving them&s;elves, on the Effects of Food, of Regimen and of Remedies?

<HEAD>CHAPTER III. Of the Means that ought to be u&s;ed at the Beginning of Di&s;ea&s;es; and of the Diet in acute Di&s;ea&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 31. I Have clearly &s;hewn the great Dangers of the Regimen, or Diet, and of the principal Medicines too generally made U&s;e of by the Bulk of the People on the&s;e Occa&s;ions. I mu&s;t now point out the actual Method they may pur&s;ue, without any Ri&s;que, on the Inva&s;ion of &s;ome acute Di&s;ea&s;es, and the general Diet which agrees with them all. As many as are de&s;irous of reap|ing any Benefit from this Treati&s;e, &s;hould attend particularly to this Chapter; &s;ince, throughout the other Parts of it, in order to avoid Repetitions, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the Diet, except the particular Di&s;temper &s;hall require a different one from that, of which I am now to give an exact Detail. And whenever I &s;hall &s;ay in general, that a Patient is to be put upon a <HI>Regimen,</HI> it will &s;ignify, that he is to be treated according to the Method pre&s;cri|bed in this Chapter; and all &s;uch Directions are to be ob&s;erved, with Regard to Air, Food, Drink and Gly&s;ters; except when I expre&s;sly order &s;omething el&s;e, as different Pti&s;ans, Gly&s;ters, &amp;c.</P>

The greater Part of Di&s;ea&s;es (by which I always under|&s;tand acute and feveri&s;h ones) frequently give &s;ome Notice of their Approach a few Weeks, and, generally, &s;ome Days before their actual Inva&s;ion; &s;uch as a light La&s;&s;itude, or Wearine&s;s, Stiff|ne&s;s or Numbne&s;s; le&s;s Activity than u&s;ual, le&s;s Appetite, a &s;mall Load or Heavine&s;s at Stomach; &s;ome Complaint in the Head: a profounder Degree of Sleep, yet le&s;s compo&s;ed, and le&s;s refre&s;h|ing than u&s;ual; le&s;s Gaiety and Liveline&s;s; &s;ometimes a light Op|pre&s;&s;ion of the Brea&s;t, a le&s;s regular Pul&s;e; a Propen&s;ity to be cold; an Aptne&s;s to &s;weat; and &s;ometimes a Suppre&s;&s;ion of a former Di&s;po&s;ition to &s;weat. At &s;uch a Term it may be practi|cable to prevent, or at lea&s;t con&s;iderably to mitigate the mo&s;t per|plexing Di&s;orders, by carefully ob&s;erving the four following Points.</P>
<P>1. To omit all violent Work or Labour, but yet not &s;o, as to di&s;continue a gentle ea&s;y Degree of Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>2. To bring the Complainant to content him&s;elf without any, or with very little, &s;olid Food; and e&s;pecially to renounce all Fle&s;h, Fle&s;h-broth, Eggs and Wine.</P>
<P>3. To drink plentifully, that is to &s;ay, at lea&s;t three Pints, or even four Pints daily, by &s;mall Gla&s;&s;es at a Time, from half hour to half hour, of the Pti&s;ans No. 1 and 2, or even of warm Water, to each Quart of which may be added half a Gla&s;s of Vinegar. No Per&s;on can be de&s;titute of this very attainable A&s;&s;i&s;tance. But &s;hould there be a Want even of Vinegar, a few Grains of com|mon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Direction of our Author's, which may &s;urprize &s;ome, probably ari&s;es from his preferring a &s;mall Quantity of the marine Acid to <HI>no</HI> Acid at all: For though a great Proportion of Salt, in &s;aving and &s;ea&s;oning Fle&s;h and other Food, generally excites Thir&s;t, yet a little of it &s;eems to have rather a different Effect, by gently &s;timulating the &s;alivary Glands: And we find that Nature very &s;eldom leaves the great diluting Element wholly void of this quickening, anti|putre&s;cent Principle, <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> Salt may be added to a Quart of warm Water for Drink. Tho&s;e who have Honey will do well to add two or three Spoon|fuls of it to the Water. A light Infu&s;ion of Elder-flowers, or of tho&s;e of the Linden, the Lime-tree, may al&s;o be advantageou&s;ly u&s;ed, and even well &s;ettled and clear &s;weet Whey.</P>
<P>4. Let the Per&s;on affected with &s;uch previous Complaints, re|ceive Gly&s;ters of warm Water, or the Gly&s;ter No. 5. By pur|&s;uing the&s;e Precautions &s;ome grievous Di&s;orders have often been happily rooted out: and although they &s;hould not prove &s;o tho|roughly efficacious, as to prevent their Appearance, they may at lea&s;t be rendered more gentle, and much le&s;s dangerous.</P>
<P>&sect; 33. Very unhappily People have taken the directly contrary Method. From the Moment the&s;e previous, the&s;e forerunning Complaints are perceived, they allow them&s;elves to eat nothing but gro&s;s Meat, Eggs, or &s;trong Meat-Soups. They leave off Garden-Stuff and Fruits, which would be &s;o proper for them; and they drink heartily (under a Notion of &s;trengthening the Stomach and expelling Wind) of Wine and other Liquors, which
<PB N="32" REF="012243_0052_0F8A6B4D083B48D8">
&s;trengthen nothing but the Fever, and expel what Degree of Health might &s;till remain. Hence all the Evacuations are re&s;trained; the Humours cau&s;ing and nouri&s;hing the Di&s;ea&s;es are not at all attempered, diluted, nor rendered proper for Evacuation. Nay, on the very contrary, they become more &s;harp, and more difficult to be di&s;charged: while a &s;ufficient Quantity of diluting refre&s;h|ing Liquor a&s;&s;wages and &s;eparates all Matters foreign to the Blood, which it purifies; and, at the Expiration of &s;ome Days, all that was noxious in it is carried off by Stool, by Urine, or by Sweat.</P>
<P>&sect; 34. When the Di&s;temper is further advanced, and the Pa|tient is already &s;eized with that Coldne&s;s or Shuddering, in a greater or le&s;s Degree, which u&s;hers in all Di&s;ea&s;es; and which is commonly attended with an univer&s;al Oppre&s;&s;ion, and Pains over all the Surface of the Body: the Patient, thus circum&s;tanced, &s;hould be put to Bed, if he cannot keep up; or &s;hould &s;it down as quietly as po&s;&s;ible, with a little more Covering than u&s;ual: he &s;hould drink every Quarter of an Hour a &s;mall Gla&s;s of the Pti&s;an, No. 1 or 2, warm: or, if that is not at Hand, of &s;ome one of tho&s;e Liquids I have recommended &sect; 32.</P>
<P>&sect; 35. The&s;e Patients earne&s;tly covet a great Load of Covering, during the Cold or Shivering; but we &s;hould be very careful to lighten them as &s;oon as it abates; &s;o that when the &s;ucceeding Heat begins, they may have no more than their u&s;ual Weight of Covering. It were to be wi&s;hed, <HI>perhaps,</HI> they had rather le&s;s. The Country People lie upon a Feather-bed, and under a downy Coverlet, or Quilt, that is commonly extremely heavy; and the Heat which is heightened and retained by Feathers, is particu|larly trouble&s;ome to Per&s;ons in a Fever. Neverthele&s;s, as it is what they are accu&s;tomed to, this Cu&s;tom may be complied with for one Sea&s;on of the Year: but during our Heats, or whenever the Fever is very violent, they &s;hould lie on a Pallet (which will be infinitely better for them) and &s;hould throw away their Coverings of Down, &s;o as to remain covered only with Sheets, or &s;omething el&s;e, le&s;s injurious than Feather-Coverings. A Per|&s;on could &s;carcely believe, who had not been, as I have, a Wit|ne&s;s of it, how much Comfort a Patient is &s;en&s;ible of, in being ea&s;ed of his former Coverings. The Di&s;temper immediately puts on a different Appearance.</P>
<P>&sect; 36. As &s;oon as the Heat after the <HI>Rigor,</HI> or Coldne&s;s and Shuddering, approaches, and the Fever is manife&s;tly advanced, we &s;hould provide for the Patient's Regimen. And</P>
<P>1, Care &s;hould be taken that the Air, in the Room where he lies, &s;hould not be too hot, the milde&s;t Degree of Warmth being very &s;ufficient; that there be as little Noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, and that no Per&s;on &s;peak to the Sick, without a Nece&s;&s;ity for it. No ex|ternal Circum&s;tance heightens the Fever more, nor inclines the Patient more to a <HI>Delirium</HI> or Raving, than the Per&s;ons in the Chamber, and e&s;pecially about the Bed. They le&s;&s;en the Spring, the ela&s;tic and refre&s;hing Power, of the Air; they prevent a Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="33" REF="012243_0053_0F8A6B4F134D8740">
of fre&s;h Air; and the Variety of Objects occupies the Brain too much. Whenever the Patient has been at Stool, or has made Urine, the&s;e Excrements &s;hould be removed immediately. The Windows &s;hould certainly be opened Night and Morning, at lea&s;t for a Quarter of an Hour each time; when al&s;o a Door &s;hould be opened, to promote an entire Renovation or Change of the Air in the Room. Neverthele&s;s, as the Patient &s;hould not be expo&s;ed at any time to a Stream or Current of Air, the Curtains of his Bed &s;hould be drawn on &s;uch Occa&s;ions; and, if he lay without any, Chairs, with Blankets or Cloaths hung upon them, &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted in the Place of Curtains, and &s;urround the Bed, while the Windows continue open, in order to defend the Patient from the Force of the ru&s;hing Air. If the Sea&s;on, how|ever, be rigidly cold, it will be &s;ufficient to keep the Windows o|pen, but for a few Minutes each time. In Summer, at lea&s;t one Window &s;hould be &s;et open Day and Night. The pouring a lit|tle Vinegar upon a red-hot Shovel al&s;o greatly conduces to re&s;tore the Spring, and to correct the Putridity, of the Air. In our greate&s;t Heats, when that in the Room &s;eems nearly &s;corching, and the &s;ick Per&s;on is &s;en&s;ibly and greatly incommoded by it, the Floor may be &s;prinkled now and then; and Branches of Willow or A&s;h-trees, dipt a little in Pails of Water, may be placed about the Room.</P>
<P>&sect; 37. 2. With Re&s;pect to the Patient's Nouri&s;hment, he mu&s;t entirely ab&s;tain from all Food; but he may always be allowed, and have daily prepared, the following Su&s;tenance, which is one of the whole&s;ome&s;t, and indi&s;putably the &s;imple&s;t one. Take half a Pound of Bread, a Mor&s;el of the fre&s;he&s;t Butter about the Size only of a Hazel Nut (which may even be omitted too) three Pints and one quarter of a Pint of Water. Boil them 'till the Bread be entirely reduced to a thin Con&s;i&s;tence. Then &s;train it, and give the Patient one eighth Part of it every three, or every four, Hours; but &s;till more rarely, if the Fever be vehemently high. Tho&s;e who have Groats, Barley, Oatmeal, or Rice, may boil and pre|pare them in the &s;ame Manner, with &s;ome Grains of Salt.</P>
<P>&sect; 38. The Sick may al&s;o be &s;ometimes indulged, in lieu of the&s;e different Spoon-meats, with raw Fruits in Summer, or in Winter with Apples baked or boiled, or Plumbs and Cherries dried and boiled. Per&s;ons of Knowledge and Experience will be very little, or rather not at all, &s;urprized, to &s;ee various Kinds of Fruit di|rected in acute Di&s;ea&s;es; the Benefit of which they may here have frequently &s;een. Such Advice can only di&s;gu&s;t tho&s;e, who remain &s;till ob&s;tinately attached to old Prejudices. But could they pre|vail on them&s;elves to reflect a little, they mu&s;t perceive that the&s;e Fruits which allay Thir&s;t; which cool and abate the Fever; which correct and attemper the putrid and heated Bile; which gently di&s;po&s;e the Belly to be rather open, and promote the Secretion and Di&s;charge of the Urine, mu&s;t prove the propere&s;t Nouri&s;hment for Per&s;ons in acute Fevers. Hence we &s;ee, as it were by a &s;trong
<PB N="34" REF="012243_0054_0F8A6B4FC93B7EB0">
Admonition from Nature her&s;elf, they expre&s;s an ardent Long|ing for them; and I have known &s;everal who would not have re|covered, but for their eating &s;ecretly large Quantities of tho&s;e Fruits they &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired, and were refu&s;ed. As many however, as are not convinced by my Rea&s;oning in this Re&s;pect, may at lea&s;t make a Trial of my Advice, on my Affirmation and Experience; when I have no Doubt but their own will &s;peedily convince them of the real Benefit received from this Sort of Nou|ri&s;hment. It will then be evident, that we may &s;afely and boldly allow, in all continual Fevers, Cherries red and black, Strawberries, the be&s;t cured Rai&s;ins, Ra&s;pberries, and Mulberries; pro|vided that all of them be perfectly ripe. Apples, Pears and Plumbs are le&s;s melting and diluting, le&s;s &s;ucculent, and rather le&s;s proper. Some Kinds of Pears however are extremely juicy, and even watery almo&s;t, &s;uch as the Dean or Valentia Pear, dif|ferent Kinds of the Buree Pear; the St. Germain, the Virgoleu&s;e, the green &s;ugary Pear, and the Summer Royal, which may all be allowed; as well as a little Juice of very ripe Plumbs, with the Addition of Water to it. This la&s;t I have known to a&s;&s;wage Thir&s;t in a Fever, beyond any other Liquor. Care &s;hould be taken at the &s;ame time, that the Sick &s;hould never be indulged in a great Quantity of any of them at once, which would overload the Stomach, and be injurious to them; but if they are given a little at a time and often, nothing can be more &s;alutary. Tho&s;e who&s;e Circum&s;tances will afford them China Oranges, or Lemons, may be regaled with the Pulp and Juice as &s;ucce&s;sfully: but with|out eating any of their Peel, which is hot and inflaming.</P>
<P>&sect; 39. 3. Their Drink &s;hould be &s;uch as allays Thir&s;t, and abates the Fever; &s;uch as dilutes, relaxes, and promotes the E|vacuations by Stool, Urine and Per&s;piration. All the Liquids which I have recommended in the preceding Chapters, jointly and &s;everally po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e Qualities. A Gla&s;s or a Gla&s;s and a half of the Juice of &s;uch Fruit as I have ju&s;t mentioned, may al|&s;o be added to three full Pints of Water.</P>
<P>&sect; 40. The Sick &s;hould drink at lea&s;t twice or thrice that Quan|tity daily, often, and a little at once, between three and four Ounces, every Quarter of an Hour. The Coldne&s;s of the Drink &s;hould ju&s;t be taken off.</P>
<P>&sect; 41. 4. If the Patient has not two Motions in the 24 Hours; if the Urine be in &s;mall Quantity and high coloured; if he rave, the Fever rage, the Pain of the Head and of the Loins be con&s;i|derable, with a Pain in the Belly, and a Propen&s;ity to vomit, the Gly&s;ter No. 5 &s;hould be given at lea&s;t once a Day. The People have generally an Aver&s;ion to this Kind of Remedy; notwith&s;tand|ing there is not any more u&s;eful in feveri&s;h Di&s;orders, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e I have ju&s;t recounted; and one Gly&s;ter commonly gives more Relief, than if the Patient had drank four or five times the Quantity of his Drinks. The U&s;e of Gly&s;ters, in different Di&s;|ea&s;es, will be properly a&s;certained in the different Chapters which
<PB N="35" REF="012243_0055_0F8A6B52AE56CB00">
treat of them. But it may be ob&s;erved in this Place, that they are never to be given at the very time the Patient is in a Sweat, which &s;eems to relieve him.</P>
<P>&sect; 42. 5. As long as the Patient hath &s;ufficient Strength for it, he &s;hould &s;it up out of Bed one Hour daily, and longer if he can bear it; but at lea&s;t half an Hour. It has a Tendency to le&s;&s;en the Fever, the Head-ach, and a Light-headine&s;s or Raving. But he &s;hould not be rai&s;ed, while he has a hopeful Sweating; though &s;uch Sweats hardly ever occur, but at the Conclu&s;ion of Di&s;ea&s;es, and after the Sick has had &s;everal other Evacuations.</P>
<P>&sect; 43. 6. His Bed &s;hould be made daily while he &s;its up; and the Sheets of the Bed, as well as the Patient's Linen, &s;hould be changed every two Days, if it can be done with Safety. An un|happy Prejudice has e&s;tabli&s;hed a contrary, and a really danger|ous, Practice. The People about the Patient dread the very Thought of his ri&s;ing out of Bed; they let him continue there in na&s;ty Linen loaden with putrid Steams and Humours; which con|tribute not only to keep up the Di&s;temper, but even to heighten it into &s;ome Degree of Malignity. I do again repeat it here, that nothing conduces more to continue the Fever and Raving, than confining the Sick con&s;tantly to Bed, and withholding him from changing his foul Linen: by relieving him from both of which Circum&s;tances I have, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of any other Reme|dy, put a Stop to a continual Delirium of twelve Days uninter|rupted Duration. It is u&s;ually &s;aid, the Patient is too weak, but this is a very weak Rea&s;on. He mu&s;t be in very nearly a dying Condition, not to be able to bear the&s;e &s;mall Commotions, which, in the very Moment when he permits them, increa&s;e his Strength, and immediately after abate his Complaints. One Advantage the Sick gain by &s;itting up a little out of Bed, is the increa&s;ed Quantity of their Urine, with greater Facility in pa&s;&s;ing it. Some have been ob&s;erved to make none at all, if they did not ri&s;e out of Bed.</P>
<P>A very con&s;iderable Number of acute Di&s;ea&s;es have been radi|cally, effectually cured by this Method, which mitigates them all. Where it is not u&s;ed, as an A&s;&s;i&s;tance at lea&s;t, Medicines are very often of no Advantage. It were to be wi&s;hed the Patient and his Friends were made to under&s;tand, that Di&s;tempers are not to be expelled at once with rough and precipitate U&s;age; that they mu&s;t have their certain Career or Cour&s;e; and that the U&s;e of the vi|olent Methods and Medicines they chu&s;e to employ, might indeed abridge the Cour&s;e of them, by killing the Patient, yet never o|therwi&s;e &s;hortened the Di&s;ea&s;e; but, on the contrary, rendered it more perplexing, tedious and ob&s;tinate; and often entailed &s;uch unhappy Con&s;equences on the Sufferer, as left him feeble and languid for the re&s;t of his Life.</P>
<P>&sect; 44. But it is not &s;ufficient to treat, and, as it were, to con|duct the Di&s;temper properly. The Term of Recovery from a Di&s;|ea&s;e requires con&s;iderable Vigilance and Attention, as it is always a State of Feeblene&s;s, and, thence, of Depre&s;&s;ion and Faintne&s;s.
<PB N="36" REF="012243_0056_0F8A6B52D119DA78">
The &s;ame Kind of Prejudice which de&s;troys the Sick, by compell|ing them to eat, during the Violence of the Di&s;ea&s;e, is extended al&s;o into the Stage of Convale&s;cence, or Recovery; and either renders it trouble&s;ome and tedious; or produces fatal Relap&s;es, and often chronical Di&s;tempers. In Proportion to the Abatement, and in the Decline of the Fever, the Quantity of Nouri&s;hment may be gradually increa&s;ed: but as long as there are any Re|mains of it, their Qualities &s;hould be tho&s;e I have already recom|mended. Whenever the Fever is compleatly terminated, &s;ome different Foods may be entered upon; &s;o that the Patient may venture upon a little white Meat, provided it be tender; &s;ome <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The mo&s;t allowable of the&s;e are Whitings, Flounders, Plaice, Dabbs, Smelts, or Gudgeons; e&s;pecially &s;uch of the la&s;t as are taken out of clear cur|rent Streams with gravelly Bottoms. Salmon, Eels, Carp, all the Skate Kind, Haddock, and the like, &s;hould not be permitted, before the Sick return to their u&s;ual Diet when in Health. It is be&s;t to begin with Fi&s;h boiled. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> Fi&s;h; a little Fle&s;h-Soup, a few Eggs at times, with Wine pro|perly diluted. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved at the &s;ame time, that the&s;e very proper Aliments which re&s;tore the Strength, when taken mo|derately, delay the perfect Cure, if they exceed in Quantity, tho' but a little; becau&s;e the Action of the Stomach being extremely weakened by the Di&s;ea&s;e and the Remedies, is capable only, as yet, of a &s;mall Degree of Dige&s;tion; and if the Quantity of its Contents exceed its Powers, they do not dige&s;t, but become pu|trid: frequent Returns of the Fever &s;upervene; a continual Fain|ti&s;hne&s;s; Head-achs; a heavy Drow&s;ine&s;s without a Power of &s;leeping comfortably; flying Pains and Heats in the Arms and Legs; Inquietude; Peevi&s;hne&s;s; Propen&s;ity to vomit; Loo&s;e|ne&s;s; Ob&s;tructions, and &s;ometimes a &s;low Fever, with a Collec|tion of Humours that comes to Suppuration.</P>
<P>All the&s;e bad Con&s;equences are prevented, by the recovering Sick contenting them&s;elves, for &s;ome time, with a very moderate Share of proper Food. We are not nouri&s;hed in Proportion to the Quan|tity we &s;wallow, but to that we dige&s;t. A Per&s;on on the mend|ing Hand, who eats moderately, dige&s;ts it and grows &s;trong from it. He who &s;wallows abundantly does not dige&s;t it, and in&s;tead of being nouri&s;hed and &s;trengthened, he withers in&s;en&s;ibly away.</P>
<P>&sect; 45. We may reduce, within the few following Rules, all that is mo&s;t e&s;pecially to be ob&s;erved, in order to procure a compleat, a perfect Termination of acute Di&s;ea&s;es; and to prevent their leaving behind them any Impediments to Health.</P>
<P>1. Let tho&s;e who are recovering, as well as tho&s;e who are ac|tually &s;ick, take very little Nouri&s;hment at a time, and take it often.</P>
<P>2. Let them take but one &s;ort of Food at each Meal, and not change their Food too often.</P>
<P>3. Let them chew whatever &s;olid Victuals they eat, very care|fully.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="012243_0057_0F8A6B53A7DBFEA8">4. Let them dimini&s;h their Quantity of Drink. The be&s;t for them in general is Water <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have known many who had an Aver&s;ion to Water, and with whom, on that very Account, it might probably agree le&s;s, find Water very grateful, in which a thoroughly baked and hot, not burnt, Slice of Bread had been infu&s;ed, until it attained the Colour of fine clear Small-beer, or light Amber coloured Beer; and I never &s;aw any Inconvenience re&s;ult from it. Doubtle&s;s pure, un|toa&s;ted, elemental Water may be preferable for tho&s;e who like, and have been accu&s;tomed to it. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE>, with a fourth or third Part of white Wine. Too great a Quantity of Liquids at this time prevents the Stomach from recovering its Tone and Strength; it impairs Di|ge&s;tion; keeps up Weakne&s;s; increa&s;es the Tendency to a Swell|ing of the Legs; &s;ometimes even occa&s;ions a flow Fever; and throws back the Per&s;on recovering into a languid State.</P>
<P>5. Let them go abroad as often as they are able, whether on Foot, in a Carriage, or on Hor&s;eback. This la&s;t Exerci&s;e is the healthie&s;t of all, and three fourths of the labouring People in this Country, who have it in their Power to procure it without Expence, are in the wrong to neglect it. They, who would practi&s;e it, &s;hould mount before their principal Meal, which &s;hould be about Noon, and never ride after it. Exerci&s;e taken before a Meal &s;trengthens the Organs of Dige&s;tion, which is promoted by it. If the Exerci&s;e is taken &s;oon after the Meal, it impairs it.</P>
<P>6. As People in this State are &s;eldom quite as well towards Night, in the Evening they &s;hould take very little Food. Their Sleep will be the le&s;s di&s;turbed for this, and repair them the more, and &s;ooner.</P>
<P>7. They &s;hould not remain in Bed above &s;even or eight Hours.</P>
<P>8. The &s;welling of the Legs and Ancles, which happens to mo&s;t Per&s;ons at this time, is not dangerous, and generally di&s;appears of it&s;elf; if they live &s;oberly and regularly and take moderate Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>9. It is not nece&s;&s;ary, in this State, that they &s;hould go con|&s;tantly every Day to Stool; though they &s;hould not be without one above two or three. If their Co&s;tivene&s;s exceeds this Term, they &s;hould receive a Gly&s;ter the third Day, and even &s;ooner, if they are heated by it, if they feel puffed up, are re&s;tle&s;s, and have any Pains in the Head.</P>
<P>10. Should they, after &s;ome time, &s;till continue very weak; if their Stomach are di&s;ordered; if they have, from time to time, a little irregular Fever, they &s;hould take three Do&s;es daily of the Pre&s;cription No. 14. which fortifies the Dige&s;tions, recovers the Strength, and drives away the Fever.</P>
<P>11. They mu&s;t by no means return to their Labour too &s;oon. This erroneous Habit daily prevents many Pea&s;ants from ever getting perfectly well, and recovering their former Strength. From not having been able to confine them&s;elves to Repo&s;e and Indolence for &s;ome Days, they never become as hearty hardy

Workmen as they had been: and this premature ha&s;ty Labour makes them lo&s;e in the Con&s;equence, every following Week of their Lives, more time than they ever gained, by their over-early re&s;uming of their Labour. I &s;ee every Day weakly Labourers, Vineroons, and other Workmen, who date the Commencement of their Weakne&s;s from that of &s;ome acute Di&s;ea&s;e, which, for want of proper Management through the Term of their Recove|ry, was never perfectly cured. A Repo&s;e of &s;even or eight Days, more than they allowed them&s;elves, would have prevented all the&s;e Infirmities; notwith&s;tanding it is very difficult to make them &s;en&s;ible of this. The Bulk, the Body of the People, in this and in many other Ca&s;es, look no further than the pre&s;ent Day; and never extend their Views to the following one. They are for ma|king no Sacrifice to Futurity; which neverthele&s;s mu&s;t be done, to render it favourable to us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IV. Of an Inflammation of the Brea&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 46. THE Inflammation of the Brea&s;t, or Peripneumony, or a Fluxion upon the Brea&s;t, is an Inflammation of the Lungs, and mo&s;t commonly of one only, and con&s;equently on one Side. The Signs by which it is evident are a Shivering, of more or le&s;s Continuance, during which the Per&s;on affected is &s;ometimes very re&s;tle&s;s and in great Angui&s;h, an e&s;&s;ential and in&s;eparable Symp|tom; and which has helped me more than once to di&s;tingui&s;h this Di&s;ea&s;e certainly, at the very In&s;tant of its Inva&s;ion. Be&s;ides this, a con&s;iderable Degree of Heat &s;ucceeds the Shivering, which Heat, for a few en&s;uing Hours, is often blended as it were, with &s;ome Returns of Chilline&s;s. The Pul&s;e is quick, pretty &s;trong, moderately full, hard and regular, when the Di&s;temper is not ve|ry violent; but &s;mall, &s;oft and irregular, when it is very dan|gerous. There is al&s;o a Sen&s;ation of Pain, but rather light and tolerable, in one Side of the Brea&s;t; &s;ometimes a Kind of Strait|ning or Pre&s;&s;ure on the Heart; at other times Pains through the whole Body, e&s;pecially along the Reins; and &s;ome Degree of Oppre&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t very often; for &s;ometimes it is but very in|con&s;iderable. The Patient finds a Nece&s;&s;ity of lying almo&s;t con|tinually upon his Back, being able to lie but very rarely upon ei|ther of his Sides. Sometimes his Cough is dry, and is then at|tended with the mo&s;t Pain; at other times it is accompanied with a Spitting or Hawking up, blended with more or le&s;s Blood, and &s;ometimes with pure &s;heer Blood. There is al&s;o &s;ome Pain, or
<PB N="39" REF="012243_0059_0F8A6B55E8940BD8">
at lea&s;t a Sen&s;ation of Weight and Heavine&s;s in the Head; and frequently a Propen&s;ity to rave. The Face is almo&s;t continually flu&s;hed and red; though &s;ometimes there is a Degree of Palene&s;s and an Air of A&s;toni&s;hment, at the Beginning of the Di&s;ea&s;e, which portend no little Danger. The Lips, the Tongue, the Pa|late, the Skin are all dry; the Breath hot; the Urine little and high coloured in the fir&s;t Stage; but more plentiful, le&s;s flaming, and letting fall much Sediment afterwards. There is a frequent Thir&s;t, and &s;ometimes an Inclination to vomit; which impo&s;ing on the ignorant A&s;&s;i&s;tants, have often inclined them to give the Patient a Vomit, which is mortal, e&s;pecially at this Juncture. The Heat becomes univer&s;al. The Symptoms are heightened almo&s;t every Night, during which the Cough is more exa&s;perated, and the Spitting or Expectoration is in le&s;s Quantity. The be&s;t Ex|pectoration is of a middling Con&s;i&s;tence, neither too thin, nor too hard and tough, like tho&s;e which are brought up at the Ter|mination of a Cold; but rather more yellow, and mixed with a little Blood, which gradually becomes &s;till le&s;s, and commonly di&s;appears entirely before the &s;eventh Day. Sometimes the In|flammation a&s;cends along the Wind-pipe, and in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;uffocates the Patient, paining him con&s;iderably in &s;wallowing, which makes him think he has a &s;ore Throat.</P>
<P>&sect; 47. Whenever the Di&s;ea&s;e is very violent at fir&s;t, or increa&s;es to be &s;uch, the Patient cannot draw his Breath, but when he fits up. The Pul&s;e becomes very &s;mall and very quick; the Coun|tenance livid, the Tongue black; the Eyes &s;tare wildly; and he &s;uffers inexpre&s;&s;ible Angui&s;h, attended with ince&s;&s;ant Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and Agitation in his Bed. One of his Arms is &s;ometimes affected with a &s;ort of Pal&s;y; he raves without Intermi&s;&s;ion, and can nei|ther thoroughly wake nor &s;leep. The Skin of his Brea&s;t and of his Neck is covered (e&s;pecially in clo&s;e &s;ultry Weather, and when the Di&s;temper is extremely violent) with livid Spots, more or le&s;s remarkable, which &s;hould be called <HI>petechial</HI> ones, but are impro|perly termed the <HI>pourpre,</HI> or purple. The natural Strength be|comes exhau&s;ted; the Difficulty of breathing increa&s;es every Mo|ment; he &s;inks into a Lethargy, and &s;oon dies a terrible Death in Country Places, by the very Effects of the inflaming Medicines they employ on &s;uch Occa&s;ions. It has been known in fact, that the U&s;e of them has rai&s;ed the Di&s;temper to &s;uch a Height, that the very Heart has been rent open, which the Di&s;&s;ection of the Body has demon&s;trated.</P>
<P>&sect; 48. If the Di&s;ea&s;e ru&s;hes on at once, with a &s;udden and vio|lent Attack; if the Horror, the Cold and Shivering la&s;t many Hours, and are followed with a nearly &s;corching Degree of Heat; if the Brain is affected from the very On&s;et; if the Patient has a &s;mall Purging, attended with a <HI>Tene&s;mus,</HI> or &s;training to Stool, often termed a <HI>Needy</HI>; if he abhors the Bed; if he either &s;weat exce&s;&s;ively, or if his Skin be extremely dry; if his natural Manner
<PB N="40" REF="012243_0060_0F8A6B5705814188">
and Look are con&s;iderably changed; and if he &s;pits up with much Difficulty, the Di&s;ea&s;e is extremely dangerous.</P>
<P>&sect; 49. He mu&s;t directly, from the fir&s;t Seizure in this State, be put upon a Regimen, and his Drink mu&s;t never be given cold. It &s;hould either be the Barley Water No. 2, the Almond Emul|&s;ion No. 4, or that of No. 7. The Juices of the Plants, which enter into the la&s;t of the&s;e Drinks, are excellent Remedies in this Ca&s;e; as they powerfully attenuate, or melt down, the vi&s;cid thick Blood, which cau&s;es the Inflammation.</P>
<P>As long as the Fever keeps up extremely violent; while the Pa|tient does not expectorate &s;ufficiently; continues raving; has a violent Head-ach, or rai&s;es up pure Blood, the Gly&s;ter No. 5 mu&s;t be given thrice, or at lea&s;t twice, in twenty four Hours. However the principal Remedy is Bleeding. As &s;oon as ever the preceding cold A&s;&s;ault is over, twelve Ounces of Blood mu&s;t be taken away at once; and, if the Patient be young and &s;trong, fourteen or even &s;ixteen. This plentiful Bleeding gives him more Ea&s;e, than if twenty four Ounces had been drawn, at three dif|ferent Times.</P>
<P>&sect; 50. When the Di&s;ea&s;e is circum&s;tanced as de&s;cribed (&sect; 46) that fir&s;t Bleeding makes the Patient ea&s;y for &s;ome Hours; but the Complaint returns; and to obviate its Violence, as much as po&s;&s;ible, we mu&s;t, except things promi&s;e extremely well, repeat the Bleeding four Hours after the fir&s;t, taking again twelve Oun|ces of Blood, which pretty often proves &s;ufficient. But if, at a|bout the Expiration of eight or ten Hours, it appears to kindle up again, it mu&s;t be repeated a third, or even a fourth Time. Yet, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of other proper Remedies, I have &s;eldom been obliged to bleed a fourth time, and have &s;ometimes found the two fir&s;t Bleedings &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>If the Di&s;ea&s;e has been of &s;everal Days Duration, when I have fir&s;t been called; if the Fever is &s;till very high; if there be a Dif|ficulty of Breathing; if the Patient does not expectorate at all, or brings up too much Blood; without being too &s;olicitous a|bout the Day of the Di&s;ea&s;e, the Patient &s;hould be bled, though it were on the tenth. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">We &s;hould however, with the greater Circum&s;pection (of how much the lon|ger &s;tanding the Di&s;ea&s;e has been, and by how much the more difficult the vi&s;|cous Humours are to be melted down and di&s;lodged) attend to the Coction of the Matter of Expectoration; which Nature does not often ea&s;ily effect, and which the effects the more imperfectly and &s;lowly, the weaker &s;he is. Her la&s;t Efforts have often been attended with &s;uch high Paroxy&s;ms, as have impo&s;ed even upon very competent Phy&s;icians, and have made them open a Vein a few Hours before the Patient's Death, from their Pul&s;es being &s;trong, hard and frequent. Exce&s;|&s;ive Weakne&s;s is the Sign, by which we may di&s;cover &s;uch unavailing Efforts to be the la&s;t. <HI>E. L.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>&sect; 51. In this, and in all other inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;es, the Blood is in a very thick vi&s;cid State: and almo&s;t immediately on its being drawn, a white tough Skin, &s;omewhat like Leather, is
<PB N="41" REF="012243_0061_0F8A6B575CA95760">
formed on its Top, which mo&s;t People have &s;een, and which is called the <HI>pleuritic Cru&s;t.</HI> It is thought a promi&s;ing Appearance, when at each Bleeding it &s;eems le&s;s hard, and le&s;s thick, than it was at the preceding ones: and this is very generally true, if the Sick feels him&s;elf, at the &s;ame time, &s;en&s;ibly better: but whoever &s;hall attend <HI>&s;olely</HI> to the Appearance of the Blood, will find him|&s;elf often deceived. It will happen, even in the mo&s;t violent In|flammation of the Brea&s;t, that this Cru&s;t is not formed, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a very unpromi&s;ing Sign. There are al&s;o, in this Re&s;pect, many odd Appearances, which ari&s;e from the &s;malle&s;t Circum&s;tances; &s;o that we mu&s;t not regulate the Repetitions of our bleeding &s;olely by this Cru&s;t: and in general we mu&s;t not be over credulous in &s;uppo&s;ing, that the Appearances in the Blood, received into the Ba&s;on, can enable us to determine, with Cer|tainty, of its real State in the Body.</P>
<P>&sect; 52. When the &s;ick Per&s;on is in the Condition de&s;cribed (&sect; 47) the Bleeding is not only unattended with Ea&s;e; but &s;ometimes it is al&s;o pernicious, by the &s;udden Weakne&s;s to which it reduces him. Generally in &s;uch a Ca&s;e all Medicines and Means are in|&s;ignificant: and it is a very bad Sign in this Di&s;ea&s;e, when this Di&s;charge is not attended with Ea&s;e and Benefit to the Sick; or when there are &s;ome Circum&s;tances, which oblige us to be &s;paring of it.</P>
<P>&sect; 53. The Patient's Legs &s;hould every Day, for one half Hour, be put into a Bath of warm Water, wrapping him up clo&s;ely; that the Cold may not check that Per&s;piration, which the Bath promotes.</P>
<P>&sect; 54. Every two Hours he &s;hould take two Spoonfuls of the Mixture No. 8, which promotes all the Di&s;charges, and chiefly that of Expectoration.</P>
<P>&sect; 55. When the Oppre&s;&s;ion and Straitne&s;s are con&s;iderable, and the Cough dry, the Patient may receive the Vapour of boiling Water, to which a little Vinegar has been added. There are two ways of affecting this; either by placing below his Face, after &s;etting him up, a Ve&s;&s;el filled with &s;uch boiling hot Water, and covering the Patient's Head and the Ve&s;&s;el with a Linen Cloth, that may inclo&s;e the Steam; or el&s;e by holding before his Mouth a Spunge dipped in the &s;ame boiling Liquor. This la&s;t Method is the lea&s;t effectual, but it fatigues the Patient con&s;iderably le&s;s. When this bad Symptom is extremely pre&s;&s;ing, Vinegar alone &s;hould be u&s;ed without Water; and the Vapour of it has often &s;aved Patients, who &s;eemed to have one Foot in the Grave; but it &s;hould be continued for &s;everal Hours.</P>
<P>&sect; 56. The outward Remedies directed in No. 9. are al&s;o ap|plied with Succe&s;s to the Brea&s;t, and to the Throat.</P>
<P>&sect; 57. When the Fever is extremely high, the Sick &s;hould take every Hour, a Spoonful of the Mixture No. 10. in a Cup of the

<P>I have cho&s;en to retain this Note of the Editor of <HI>Lyons,</HI> from having fre|quently &s;een the Inefficacy, and &s;ometimes, I have even thought, the ill Effects of Acids in Peripneumonies and Pleuri&s;ies, in a Country far &s;outh of <HI>Swi&s;&s;er|land</HI>; and where the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es are very frequent, acute and fatal. On the other hand I &s;hall add the Sub&s;tance of what Dr. TISSOT &s;ays on this Head in a Note to his Table of Remedies, wherein he affirms, that he has given in this Di&s;ea&s;e very large Do&s;es of them, ri&s;ing gradually from &s;mall ones, and always with great Succe&s;s; intreating other Phy&s;icians to order this Acid (the Spirit of Sul|phur) in the &s;ame large Do&s;es which he directs in this Chapter, and a&s;&s;uring him&s;elf of their Thanks, for its good Con&s;equences.&mdash;Now the only ill Ef|fect I can &s;urmize here, from &s;hewing this Diver&s;ity of Opinion in the&s;e two learned Phy&s;icians, and my own Doubts, is, that the Subjects of this Di&s;ea&s;e in Country Places may prove &s;omewhat confu&s;ed and irre&s;olute by it, in their Con|duct in &s;uch Ca&s;es. But as all of us certainly concur in the great Intention of doing all po&s;&s;ible Good, by the exten&s;ive Publication of this Treati&s;e, I &s;hall take Leave to ob&s;erve that in this Di&s;ea&s;e, and in Pleuri&s;ies, more &s;olid Benefit has been received in <HI>Carolina, Virginia,</HI> &amp;c. from the U&s;e of the <HI>Seneka</HI> Rattle|&s;nake Root, than from any other Medicine whatever. Bleeding indeed is nece&s;|&s;arily premi&s;ed to it; but it has often &s;aved the Nece&s;&s;ity of many repeated Bleedings. This Medicine, which is termed in Latin, the <HI>Polygala Virginiana,</HI> is certainly rather of a &s;aponaceous attenuating Quality, and betray not any Marks of Acidity, being rather moderately acrid. There will be occa&s;ion to mention it more particularly in the &s;ub&s;equent chapter, as &s;uch a liberty can need no Apology to any philo&s;ophical Phy&s;ician. <HI>K.</HI></P></NOTE> but without dimini&s;hing on this Account the u&s;ual Quantity of his other Drinks, which may be taken immediately after it.</P>
<P>&sect; 58. As long as the Patient &s;hall grow wor&s;e, or only continue equally bad, the &s;ame Medicines are to be repeated. But if on the third Day (though it rarely happens &s;o &s;oon) or fourth, or fifth, the Di&s;ea&s;e takes a more favourable Turn; if the Exa&s;pera|tion returns with le&s;s Violence; the Cough be le&s;s &s;evere; the Matter coughed up le&s;s bloody: if Re&s;piration becomes ea&s;ier; the Head be le&s;s affected; the Tongue not quite &s;o dry; if the high Colour of the Urine abates, and its Quantity be increa&s;ed, it may be &s;ufficient then to keep the Patient carefully to his Regi|men, and to give him a Gly&s;ter every Evening. The Exa&s;pera|tion that occurs the fourth Day is often the highe&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect; 59. This Di&s;temper is mo&s;t commonly terminated and car|ried off by Expectoration, and often by Urine, which on the &s;e|venth, the ninth, or the eleventh Day, and &s;ometimes on the Days between them, begins to let fall a plentiful Sediment, or Settling, of a pale red Colour, and &s;ometimes real <HI>Pus</HI> or ripe Matter. The&s;e Di&s;charges are &s;ucceeded by Sweats, which are
<PB N="43" REF="012243_0063_0F8A6B58DA90EF10">
as &s;erviceable then, as they were injurious at the Beginning of the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; 60. Some Hours before the&s;e Evacuations appear, there come on, and not &s;eldom, &s;ome very alarming Symptoms, &s;uch as great Angui&s;h; Palpitations; &s;ome Irregularity in the Pul&s;e; an increa&s;ed Oppre&s;&s;ion, convul&s;ive Motions (this being what is called the <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> the Height, or Turn of the Di&s;temper) but they are no ways dangerous, provided they do not occa&s;ion any im|proper Treatment. The&s;e Symptoms depend on the morbid and purulent Matter, which, being di&s;lodged, circulates with the Hu|mours, and irritates different Parts, until the Di&s;charge of it has fairly begun; after which all &s;uch Symptoms di&s;appear, and Sleep generally en&s;ues. However I cannot too &s;trongly in&s;i&s;t on the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of great Prudence in &s;uch Circum&s;tances. Sometimes it is the Weakne&s;s of the Patient, and at other times Convul&s;ions, or &s;ome other Symptoms, that terrify the By-&s;tanders. If, which is mo&s;t generally the Ca&s;e, the ab&s;urd Practice of directing parti|cular Remedies for &s;uch Accidents takes place, &s;uch as &s;pirituous Cordials, Venice Treacle, Confections, Ca&s;tor and Rue; the Con&s;equence is, that Nature being di&s;turbed in her Operations, the <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> or Turn is not effected; the Matter which &s;hould be di&s;charged by Stool, by Urine or by Sweat, is not di&s;charged out of the Body; but is thrown upon &s;ome internal or external part of it. Should it be on &s;ome inward part, the Patient either dies at once; or another Di&s;temper &s;ucceeds, more trouble&s;ome and incurable than the fir&s;t. Should it be expelled to &s;ome outward part, the Danger indeed is le&s;s; and as &s;oon as ever &s;uch Tu|mour appears, ripening Poultices &s;hould be applied to bring it to a Head, after which it &s;hould immediately be opened.</P>
<P>&sect; 61. In order to prevent &s;uch unhappy Con&s;equences, great Care mu&s;t be taken, whenever &s;uch terrifying Symptoms come on, [about the Time of the <HI>Cri&s;is</HI>] to make no Change in the Di|et, nor in the Treatment of the Patient; except in giving him the loo&s;ening Gly&s;ter No. 5; and applying every two Hours a Flanel, &s;queezed out of warm Water, which may cover all the Belly, and in a Manner go round the Body behind the Reins. The Quanti|ty of his Drink may al&s;o be increa&s;ed a little; and that of his Nouri&s;hment le&s;&s;ened, as long as the high and violent State con|tinues.</P>
<P>&sect; 62. I have not &s;poken of Vomits or Purges, as being directly contrary to the Nature of this Di&s;ea&s;e; Anodynes, or Opiates, to procure Sleep are al&s;o, in general, very improper. In a few Ca&s;es, however, they may po&s;&s;ibly be u&s;eful; but the&s;e Ca&s;es are &s;o very difficult to be &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed, that Opiates &s;hould never be admitted in this Di&s;ea&s;e, without the Pre&s;ence and Advice of a Phy&s;ician. I have &s;een many Patients who have been thrown into an incurable Hectic, by taking them improperly. When the Di&s;ea&s;e is not received in a mortal Degree, nor has been injudiciou&s;ly treated, and proceeds in a benign regular Man|ner,
<PB N="44" REF="012243_0064_0F8A6B598AA80700">
the Patient may be called very well and &s;afe by the fourteenth Day; when he may, if he has an Appetite, be put upon the Di|et of People who are recovering. But if he &s;till retains an Aver|&s;ion to Food; if his Mouth is foul and furred, and he is &s;en&s;ible of &s;ome Heavine&s;s in his Head, he &s;hould take the purging Po|tion No. II.</P>
<P>&sect; 63. Bleedings from the No&s;e occur &s;ometimes naturally in this Di&s;ea&s;e, even after repeated Bleedings by Art; the&s;e are ve|ry benign and favourable, and are commonly attended with more Ea&s;e and Relief than artificial Bleedings. Such voluntary Di&s;|charges may &s;ometimes be expected, when the Patient is &s;en&s;ibly mended in many Re&s;pects after the U&s;e of the Lancet; and yet complains of a great Pain in his Head, accompanied with quick &s;parkling Eyes, and a Redne&s;s of the No&s;e. Nothing &s;hould be done to &s;top the&s;e voluntary Bleedings, &s;ince it would be very dangerous; for when Nature has fulfilled her Intention by them, they cea&s;e of them&s;elves. At other times, but more rarely, the Di&s;temper is carried off by a natural Purging, attended with mo|derate Pain, and the Di&s;charge of bilious Matter.</P>
<P>&sect; 64. If the Expectoration, or hawking up of Matter, &s;tops very &s;uddenly, and is not &s;peedily attended with &s;ome other Eva|cuation; the Oppre&s;&s;ion and Angui&s;h of the Patient immediately return, and the Danger is great and pre&s;&s;ing. If the Di&s;temper, at this Juncture, is not of many Days &s;tanding; if the Patient is a &s;trong Per&s;on; if he has not as yet been plentifully bled; if there be &s;till &s;ome Blood mixed with the Humour he expectorates; or if the Pul&s;e be &s;trong and hard, he &s;hould be bled immediately in the Arm; and con&s;tantly receive the Steam of hot Water and Vinegar by the Mouth, and drink plentifully of the Pti&s;an No. 2, &s;omething hotter than ordinary. But if his Circum&s;tances, after this Suppre&s;&s;ion, are different from the&s;e ju&s;t mentioned; in&s;tead of bleeding him, two Bli&s;ters &s;hould be applied to the Legs; and he &s;hould drink plentifully of the Pti&s;an No. 12.</P>
<P>The Cau&s;es which oftene&s;t produce this Suppre&s;&s;ion of his Ex|pectoration are, 1, a &s;harp and &s;udden cold Air. 2, too hot a one. 3, over hot Medicines. 4, exce&s;&s;ive Sweating. 5, a Purge prematurely and injudiciou&s;ly timed. And 6, &s;ome immo|derate Pa&s;&s;ion of the Mind.</P>
<P>&sect; 65. When the Sick has not been &s;ufficiently bled, or not &s;oon enough; and even &s;ometimes, which I have &s;een, when he has been greatly weakened by exce&s;&s;ive Bleeding; &s;o that the Di&s;|charges by Stool, Urine, Expectoration and Per&s;piration, have not been &s;ufficiently made; when the&s;e Di&s;charges have been con|fu&s;ed by &s;ome other Cau&s;es; or the Di&s;ea&s;e has been injudiciou&s;ly treated; then the Ve&s;&s;els that have been inflamed, do not unload them&s;elves of the Humours which &s;tuff up and oppre&s;s them; but there happens in the Sub&s;tance of the affected Lung, the &s;ame Cir|cum&s;tance we &s;ee daily occur on the Surface of the Body. If an inflammatory Tumour or Swelling does not di&s;per&s;e it&s;elf, and di&s;|appears
<PB N="45" REF="012243_0065_0F8A6B5ABB582F38">
in&s;en&s;ibly, it forms an Impo&s;thume or Ab&s;ce&s;s. Thus exactly al&s;o in the inflamed Lung, if the Inflammation is not di&s;&s;i|pated, it forms an Ab&s;ce&s;s, which, in that part, is called a <HI>Vomi|ca</HI>: and the Matter of that Ab&s;ce&s;s, like the external ones, remains often long inclo&s;ed in its Sac or Bag, without bur&s;ting open its Membrane or Ca&s;e, and di&s;charging the Matter it contains.</P>
<P>&sect; 66. If the Inflammation was not very deeply &s;eated in the inward Sub&s;tance of the di&s;ea&s;ed Lung; but was extended to its Surface, that is very near the Ribs, the Sac will bur&s;t on the Sur|face of the Lung; and the Matter contained in it mu&s;t be di&s;|charged into the Cavity, or Hollowne&s;s of the Brea&s;t, between the Lung, the Ribs, and the Diaphragm or Midriff, which is the Membrane that divides the Brea&s;t and the Belly. But when the Inflammation is con&s;iderably deeper, the Impo&s;thume bur&s;ts with-in&s;ide of the Lung it&s;elf. If its Orifice, or Opening is &s;o &s;mall, that but little can get out at once; if the Quantity of all the Mat|ter be incon&s;iderable, and the Patient is at the &s;ame time pretty &s;trong, he coughs up the Matter, and is very &s;en&s;ibly relieved. But if this <HI>Vomica</HI> be large, or if its Orifice is wide, and it throws out a great Quantity of Matter at once; or if the Patient is very weak, he dies the Moment it bur&s;ts, and that &s;ometimes when it is lea&s;t expected. I have &s;een one Patient &s;o circum&s;tanced ex|pire, as he was conveying a Spoonful of Soup to his Mouth; and another while he was wiping his No&s;e. There was no pre&s;ent Symptom in either of the&s;e Ca&s;es, whence a Phy&s;ician might &s;up|po&s;e them likelier to die at that In&s;tant, than for &s;ome Hours be|fore. The <HI>Pu&s;,</HI> or Matter, is commonly di&s;charged through the Mouth after Death, and the Bodies very &s;oon become putrified.</P>
<P>&sect; 67. We call that <HI>Vomica</HI> which is not bur&s;t, an <HI>occult</HI> or hidden, and that which is, an evident or open one. It is of con&s;iderable Importance to treat exactly and clearly of this Topic; as a great Number of Country People die of the&s;e Impo&s;thumes, even with|out a Su&s;picion of the Cau&s;e of their Death. I had an In&s;tance of it &s;ome Days &s;ince, in the School-ma&s;ter of a Village. He had an occult and very con&s;iderable <HI>Vomica</HI> in the left Lung, which was the Con&s;equence of an Inflammation of the Brea&s;t, that had been treated improperly at the Beginning. He &s;eemed to me not likely to live twenty four Hours; and in fact died in the Night, after inexpre&s;&s;ible Angui&s;h. It is highly probable he died as &s;oon as the <HI>Vomica</HI> bur&s;t, a large Quantity of Matter being di&s;charged from his Mouth after his Death.</P>
<P>&sect; 68. Whatever Di&s;temper is included within the Brea&s;t of a living Patient, is neither an Object of the Sight nor Touch; whence the&s;e <HI>Vomicas,</HI> the&s;e inward Tumours, are &s;o often unknown, and indeed un&s;u&s;pected. The Evacuations that were nece&s;&s;ary for the Cure, or &s;ometimes for the Prevention, of them, have not taken Place during the fir&s;t fourteen Days. At the End of this Term, the Patient, far from being cured, is not very con&s;idera|bly relieved; but, on the contrary, the Fever continues to be
<PB N="46" REF="012243_0066_0F8A6B5B4918B470">
pretty high, with a Pul&s;e continually quick; in general &s;oft and weak; though &s;ometimes pretty hard, and often fluctuating, or, as it were, waving. His Breathing is &s;till difficult and oppre&s;&s;ed; with &s;mall cold Shudderings from time to time; an Exa&s;peration of the Fever; flu&s;hed Cheeks, dry Lips, and Thir&s;t.</P>
<P>The Increa&s;e of the&s;e Symptoms declares, that <HI>Pus</HI> or Matter is thoroughly formed: the Cough then becomes more continual, being exa&s;perated with the lea&s;t Motion; or as &s;oon as ever the Patient has taken any Nouri&s;hment. He can repo&s;e only on the Side affected. It often happens indeed that he cannot lie down at all; but is obliged to be &s;et up all Day; &s;ometimes even with|out daring to lean a little upon his Loins, for fear of increa&s;ing the Cough and Oppre&s;&s;ion. He is unable to &s;leep; has a conti|nual Fever, and his Pul&s;e frequently intermits.</P>
<P>The Fever is not only heightened every Evening; but the &s;malle&s;t Quantity of Food, the gentle&s;t Motion, a little Cough|ing, the lighte&s;t Agitation of the Mind, a little more than u&s;ual Heat in the Chamber, Soup either a little too &s;trong, or a little too &s;alt, increa&s;e the Quickne&s;s of his Pul&s;e the Moment they oc|cur, or are given. He is quite re&s;tle&s;s, has &s;ome &s;hort Attacks of the mo&s;t terrible Angui&s;h, accompanied and &s;ucceeded by Sweat|ings on his Brea&s;t, and from his whole Countenance. He &s;weats &s;ometimes the whole Night; his Urine is reddi&s;h, now frothy, and at other times oily, as it were. Sudden Flu&s;hings, hot as Flames, ri&s;e into his whole Vi&s;age. The greater Number of the Sick are commonly &s;en&s;ible of a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable Ta&s;te in their Mouths; &s;ome of old &s;trong Chee&s;e; others of rotten Eggs; and others again of &s;tinking Meat, and fall greatly away. The Thir&s;t of &s;ome is unquenchable; their Mouths and Lips are parched; their Voice is weak and hoar&s;e; their Eyes are hollow, with a Kind of Wildne&s;s in their Looks. They have a general Di&s;gu&s;t to all Food: and if they &s;hould a&s;k for &s;ome particular Nouri&s;hment without &s;eeing it, they reject it the Moment it is brought them; and their Strength at length &s;eems wholly ex|hau&s;ted.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Symptoms, a little Inflation, or <HI>Bloatedne&s;s,</HI> as it were, is &s;ometimes ob&s;erved on the Brea&s;t, towards the Side af|fected; with an almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible Change of Colour. If the <HI>Vo|mica</HI> be &s;ituated at the Bottom of the affected Lobe of the Lungs, and in its internal Part, that is, nearly in the Middle of the Brea&s;t, &s;ome <HI>Puffine&s;s</HI> or light Swelling may be perceived in &s;ome Bodies, by gently pre&s;&s;ing the Pit of their Stomach; e&s;pecially when the Patient coughs. In &s;hort, according to the Ob&s;erva|tions of a <HI>German</HI> Phy&s;ician, if one &s;trike the open Hand on the Brea&s;t, covered only with a Shirt, it retains in the Spot, which is directly oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Vomica,</HI> a flat heavy Sound, as if one &s;truck a Piece of Fle&s;h; while in &s;triking on the other Side it gives a clear loud Sound, as from a Drum. I &s;till doubt how|ever, whether this Ob&s;ervation will generally hold true; and it
<PB N="47" REF="012243_0067_0F8A6B5D4616AB88">
would be hazardous to affirm there is no Ab&s;ce&s;s in a Brea&s;t, which does not return this heavy Sound.</P>
<P>&sect; 69. When a <HI>Vomica</HI> is formed, as long as it is not emptied, all the Symptoms I have already enumerated increa&s;e, and the <HI>Vomica</HI> grows in Size: the whole Side of the Lung affected &s;ome|times becomes a Bag or Sac of Matter. The &s;ound Side is com|pre&s;&s;ed; and the Patient dies after dreadful Angui&s;h, with the Lungs full of <HI>Pus,</HI> and without having ever brought up any.</P>
<P>To avoid &s;uch fatal Con&s;equences, it is nece&s;&s;ary to procure the Rupture and Di&s;charge of this inward Ab&s;ce&s;s, as &s;oon as we are certain of its Exi&s;tence: And as it is &s;afer it &s;hould break within the Lobe affected, from whence it may be di&s;charged by hawk|ing up; than that it &s;hould bur&s;t and void it&s;elf into the Cavity of the Brea&s;t, (for Rea&s;ons I &s;hall give hereafter) we mu&s;t endea|vour, that this Rupture may be affected within the internal Sub|&s;tance of the Lungs.</P>
<P>&sect; 70. The mo&s;t effectual Methods to procure this are, 1. To make the Patient continually receive, by his Mouth, the Vapour of warm Water. 2. When by this Means that part of the Sac or Ab&s;ce&s;s is &s;oftened, where we could wi&s;h the Rupture of it to hap|pen, the Patient is to &s;wallow a large Quantity of the mo&s;t emo|lient Liquid; &s;uch as Barley Water, Almond Milk, light Veal Broth, or Milk and Water. By this Means the Stomach is kept always full: &s;o that the Re&s;i&s;tance to the Lungs being con&s;idera|ble on that Side, the Ab&s;ce&s;s and its Contents will naturally be pre&s;&s;ed towards the Side of the Wind-pipe, as it will meet with le&s;s Re&s;i&s;tance there. This Fulne&s;s of the Stomach will al&s;o in|cline the Patient to cough, which may concur to produce a good Event. Hence, 3, we &s;hould endeavour to make the Patient cough, by making him to &s;mell &s;ome Vinegar, or even to &s;nuff up a little; or by injecting into his Throat, by the Means of a &s;mall Syringe or Pipe, &s;uch as Children make out of &s;hort Pieces of El|der boughs, a little Water or Vinegar. 4. He &s;hould be advi&s;ed to bawl out aloud, to read loud, or to laugh heartily; all which Means contribute to bur&s;t open the Ab&s;ce&s;s, as well as the two fol|lowing ones. 5. Let him take every two Hours a Soup-Ladle of the Potion No. 8. 6. He &s;hould be put into a Cart, or &s;ome o|ther Carriage; but not before he has drank plentifully of &s;uch Liquors as I have ju&s;t mentioned: after which the Shaking and Jolting in the Carriage have &s;ometimes immediately procured that Rupture, or breaking of the Bag or Ab&s;ce&s;s, we wi&s;hed for.</P>
<P>&sect; 71. Some Years &s;ince I &s;aw a Country Maid Servant, who was left in a langui&s;hing Condition after an Inflammation of the Brea&s;t; without any Per&s;on's &s;u&s;pecting her Ailment. This Wo|man being put into a Cart that was &s;ent for a Load of Hay, one of the Wheels ran violently again&s;t a Tree: &s;he &s;wooned away, and at the &s;ame time brought up a great Quantity of dige&s;ted Matter: She continued to bring up more; during which I was informed of her Ca&s;e, and of the Accident, which effectually cured her.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="012243_0068_0F8A6B5D687E1E90">A <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> Officer, who &s;erved in <HI>Piedmont,</HI> had been in a languid State of Health for &s;ome Months; and returned home to &s;et him|&s;elf down as ea&s;ily as he could, without conceiving any con&s;iderable Hopes of Recovery. Upon entering into his own Country, by the Way of <HI>Mount Bernard</HI>; and being obliged to go &s;ome Paces on Foot, he fell down, and remained in a Swoon above a Quarter of an Hour: during which time he threw up a large Quantity of Mat|ter, and found him&s;elf that very Moment very greatly relieved. I ordered him a proper Diet, and &s;uitable Medicines: his Health became perfectly e&s;tabli&s;hed; and the Pre&s;ervation of his Life was principally owing to this lucky Fall.</P>
<P>Many Per&s;ons afflicted with a <HI>Vomica,</HI> faint away the very In|&s;tant it breaks. Some &s;harp Vinegar &s;hould be directly held to their No&s;e. This &s;mall A&s;&s;i&s;tance is generally &s;ufficient, where the bur&s;ting of it is not attended with &s;uch Appearances as &s;hew it to be mortal, in which Ca&s;e every Application is in&s;ignificant.</P>
<P>&sect; 72. If the &s;ick Per&s;on was not extremely weak before the bur&s;ting of the Ab&s;ce&s;s; if the Matter was white, and well condi|tioned; if the Fever abates after it; if the Angui&s;h, Oppre&s;&s;ion and Sweats terminate; if the Cough is le&s;s violent; if the Patient is &s;en&s;ibly ea&s;ier in his Situation or Po&s;ture; if he recovers his Sleep and Appetite; if his u&s;ual Strength returns; if the Quanti|ty he expectorates, or brings up, becomes daily and gradually le&s;s; and if his Urine is apparently better, we may have room to hope, that by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Remedies I &s;hall immediately direct, he may be radically, compleatly cured.</P>
<P>&sect; 73. But if on the contrary; when his Strength is exhau&s;ted before the bur&s;ting of the Ab&s;ce&s;s; when the Matter is too thin and tran&s;parent, brown, green, yellow, bloody and of an offen|&s;ive Smell; if the Pul&s;e continues quick and weak; if the Pa|tient's Appetite, Strength and Sleep do not improve, there re|mains no Hope of a Cure, and the be&s;t Medicines are ineffectual: Neverthele&s;s we ought to make &s;ome Trial of them.</P>
<P>&sect; 74. They con&s;i&s;t of the following Medicines and Regulations. I. Give every four Hours a little Barley or Rice Cream. 2. If the Matter brought up is thick and glewy, &s;o that it is very dif|ficult to be loo&s;ened and di&s;charged, give every two Hours a Soup-ladle of the Potion No. 8; and between the giving the&s;e two, let the Patient take every half Hour a Cup of the Drink No. 13.&mdash; 3. When the Con&s;i&s;tence of the Matter is &s;uch, that there is no Occa&s;ion for the&s;e Medicines to promote the Di&s;charge of it, they mu&s;t be omitted; tho' the &s;ame Sort and Quantity of Food are to be continued; but with the Addition of an equal Quantity of Milk: or, which would be &s;till more beneficial, in&s;tead of this Mixture, we &s;hould give the &s;ame Quantity of New-Milk, ta|ken from a good Cow, which, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, may com|po&s;e the whole Nouri&s;hment of the Patient. 4. He &s;hould take four times a Day, beginning early in the Morning, and at the Di&s;tance of two Hours, a Do&s;e of the Powder No. 14, diluted
<PB N="49" REF="012243_0069_0F8A6B5E12679BE0">
in a little Water, or made into a <HI>Bolus,</HI> or Mor&s;el, with a little Syrup or Honey. His common Drink &s;hould be Almond E|mul&s;ion, commonly called Almond Milk, or Barley Water, or fre&s;h Water with a fourth Part Milk. 5. He &s;hould air and ex|erci&s;e every Day on Hor&s;eback, or in a Carriage, according as his Strength and his Circum&s;tances will allow him. But of all Sorts of Exerci&s;e, that upon a trotting Hor&s;e is, beyond all Com|pari&s;on, the very be&s;t, and the ea&s;ie&s;t to be procured by every Bo|dy; provided the Di&s;ea&s;e be not too far advanced; &s;ince in &s;uch a Situation, any Exerci&s;e that was only a little violent, might prove pernicious.</P>
<P>&sect; 75. The Multitude, who are generally illiterate, &s;eldom con|&s;ider any thing as a Remedy, except they &s;wallow it. They have but little Confidence in Regimen, or any A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Way of Diet, and con&s;ider riding on Hor&s;eback as wholly u&s;ele&s;s to them. This is a dangerous Mi&s;take, of which I &s;hould be glad to unde|ceive them: &s;ince this A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which appears &s;o in&s;ignificant to them, is probably the mo&s;t effectual of any: it is that, in fact, without which they can &s;carcely expect a Cure, in the highe&s;t Degrees of this Di&s;ea&s;e: it is that, which perhaps alone may re|cover them, provided they take no improper Food. In brief it is con&s;idered, and with Rea&s;on, as the real Specific for this Di&s;|ea&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; 76. The Influence of the Air is of more Importance in this Di&s;order, than in any others; for which Rea&s;on great Care &s;hould be taken to admit the be&s;t, into the Patient's Chamber. For this Purpo&s;e it &s;hould often be ventilated, or have an Admi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h Air; be &s;weetened from time to time, tho' very lightly, by &s;prinkling about a little good Vinegar; and in the Sea&s;on it &s;hould be plentifully &s;upplied with agreeable Herbs, Flowers and Fruits. Should the Sick be unfortunately &s;ituated, and confined in an un|whole&s;ome Air, there can be but little Pro&s;pect of curing him, without altering it.</P>
<P>&sect; 77. Out of many Per&s;ons affected with the&s;e Di&s;orders, &s;ome have been cured by taking nothing what&s;oever but Butter-milk; others by Melons and Cucumbers only; and others again by Summer Fruits of every Sort. Neverthele&s;s, as &s;uch Ca&s;es are &s;ingular, and have been but few, I advi&s;e the Patient to ob&s;erve the Method I have directed here, as the &s;ure&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect; 78. It is &s;ufficient if he have a Stool once in two, or even in three Days. Hence there is no Rea&s;on for him, in this Ca&s;e, to accu&s;tom him&s;elf to Gly&s;ters: they may excite a Loo&s;ene&s;s, which would be very dangerous.</P>
<P>&sect; 79. When the Di&s;charge of the Matter from the Brea&s;t dimini&s;hes, and the Patient is perceivably mended in every Re&s;pect, it is a Proof that the Wound in the Ab&s;ce&s;s is deterged, or clean, and that it is di&s;po&s;ed to heal up gradually. If the Suppuration, or Di&s;charge, continues in great Quantity; if it &s;eems but of an indifferent Con&s;i&s;tence; if the Fever returns every Evening, it may
<PB N="50" REF="012243_0070_0F8A6B6076CDDC88">
be apprehended that the Wound, in&s;tead of healing, may degene|rate into an Ulcer, which mu&s;t prove a mo&s;t embarra&s;&s;ing Con&s;e|quence. Under &s;uch a Circum&s;tance, the Patient would fall into a confirmed Hectic, and die after &s;ome Months Sickne&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; 80. I am not acquainted with any better Remedy, in &s;uch a dangerous Ca&s;e, than a Per&s;everance in the&s;e already directed, and e&s;pecially in moderate Exerci&s;e on Hor&s;eback. In &s;ome of them indeed, Recour&s;e may be had to the &s;weet Vapours of &s;ome vulnerary Herbs in hot Water, with a little Oil of Turpentine, as directed No. 15. I have &s;een them &s;ucceed; but the &s;afe&s;t Way is to con&s;ult a Phy&s;ician, who may examine and con&s;ider, if there is not &s;ome particular Circum&s;tance combined with the Di&s;|ea&s;e, that proves an Ob&s;tacle to the Cure of it. If the Cough prevents the Patient from Sleeping, he may take in the Evening two or three Table Spoonfuls of the Pre&s;cription No. 16, in a Gla&s;s of Almond Milk or Barley Water.</P>
<P>&sect; 81. The very &s;ame Cau&s;es which &s;uddenly &s;uppre&s;s the Ex|pectoration, in an Inflammation of the Brea&s;t, may al&s;o check the Expectoration from a <HI>Vomica</HI> already begun: in which Circum|&s;tance the Patient is &s;peedily afflicted with an Oppre&s;&s;ion and An|gui&s;h, a Fever and evident Feeblene&s;s. We &s;hould immediately endeavour to remove this Stoppage, by the Vapour of hot Water; by giving a Spoonful of the Mixture No. 3. every Hour; by a large Quantity of the Pti&s;an No. 12, and by a proper Degree of Motion or Exerci&s;e. As &s;oon as ever the Expectoration returns, the Fever and the other Symptoms di&s;appear. I have &s;een this Suppre&s;&s;ion in &s;trong Habits quickly followed with an Inflamma|tion about the Seat of the <HI>Vomica,</HI> that has obliged me to bleed, after which the Expectoration immediately returned.</P>
<P>&sect; 82. It happens &s;ometimes, that the <HI>Vomica</HI> is entirely clean&s;ed; the Expectoration is entirely fini&s;hed, or drained off, the Patient &s;eems well, and thinks him&s;elf compleatly cured: but &s;oon after the Unea&s;ine&s;s, Oppre&s;&s;ion, Cough and Fever are renewed, be|cau&s;e the Membrane or Bag of the <HI>Vomica</HI> fills again: again it empties it&s;elf, the Patient expectorates for &s;ome Days, and &s;eems to recover. After &s;ome time however, the &s;ame Scene is repeat|ed; and this Vici&s;&s;itude, or Succe&s;&s;ion of moderate and of bad Health, often continues for &s;ome Months and even &s;ome Years. This happens when the <HI>Vomica</HI> is emptied and is gradually deterged; &s;o that its Membranes, or Sides, touch or approach each other; but without cicatrizing or healing firmly; and then there drops or leaks in very gradually fre&s;h Matter. For a few Days this &s;eems no ways to incommode the Patient; but as &s;oon as a cer|tain Quantity is accumulated, he is vi&s;ited again with &s;ome of the former Symptoms, 'till another Evacuation en&s;ues. People thus circum&s;tanced, in this Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ometimes appear to enjoy a toler|able Share of Health. It may be con&s;idered as a Kind of internal I&s;&s;ue, which empties and clean&s;es it&s;elf from time to time; pretty frequently in &s;ome Con&s;titutions, more &s;lowly in others; and un|der
<PB N="51" REF="012243_0071_0F8A6B615540D778">
which &s;ome may attain a good middling Age. When it ar|rives however at a very con&s;iderable Duration, it proves incurable. In its earlie&s;t State it gives way &s;ometimes to a Milk-diet, to rid|ing on Hor&s;eback, and to the Medicine No. 14.</P>
<P>&sect; 83. Some may be &s;urprized, that in treating of an Ab&s;ce&s;s of the Lungs, and of the Hectic, which is a Con&s;equence of it, I &s;ay nothing of tho&s;e Remedies, commonly termed <HI>Bal&s;amics,</HI> and &s;o frequently employed in them, for in&s;tance, Turpentines, Bal&s;am of Peru, of Mecca, Frankincen&s;e, Ma&s;tich, Myrrh, Storax and Bal&s;am of Sulphur. I &s;hall however &s;ay briefly here (becau&s;e it is equally my De&s;ign to de&s;troy the Prejudices of the People, in favour of improper Medicines, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the Reputation of good ones) that I never in &s;uch Ca&s;es made u&s;e of the&s;e Medi|cines; becau&s;e I am convinced, that their Operation is generally hurtful in &s;uch Ca&s;es; becau&s;e I &s;ee them daily productive of real Mi&s;chief, that they protract the Cure, and often change a &s;light Di&s;order into an incurable Di&s;ea&s;e. They are incapable of per|fect Dige&s;tion, they ob&s;truct the fine&s;t Ve&s;&s;els of the Lungs, who&s;e Ob&s;tructions we &s;hould endeavour to remove; and evidently oc|ca&s;ion, except their Do&s;e be extremely &s;mall, Heat and Oppre&s;&s;ion. I have very often &s;een to a Demon&s;tration, that Pills compounded of Myrth, Turpentine and Bal&s;am of Peru, have, an Hour after they were &s;wallowed, occa&s;ioned a Tumult and Agitation in the Pul&s;e, high Flu&s;hings, Thir&s;t and Oppre&s;&s;ion. In &s;hort, it is de|mon&s;trable to every unprejudiced Per&s;on, that the&s;e Remedies, as they have been called, are truly prejudicial in this Ca&s;e; and I heartily wi&s;h People may be di&s;abu&s;ed with re&s;pect to them; and that they may lo&s;e that Reputation &s;o unhappily a&s;cribed to them.</P>
<P>I know that many Per&s;ons, very capable in other Re&s;pects, dai|ly make u&s;e of them in the&s;e Di&s;tempers: &s;uch however cannot fail of di&s;u&s;ing them, as &s;oon as they &s;hall have ob&s;erved their Effects, ab&s;tracted from the Virtues of the other Medicines to which they add them, and which mitigate the Danger of them. I &s;aw a Patient, whom a foreign Surgeon, living at <HI>Orbe,</HI> attempt|ed to cure of a Hectic with melted Bacon, (much the &s;ame as Hog's Lard) which aggravated the Di&s;ea&s;e. This Advice &s;eemed, and certainly was, ab&s;urd; neverthele&s;s the Bal&s;amics ordered in &s;uch Ca&s;es are probably not more dige&s;tible than fat Bacon. The Powder No. 14 po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es whatever the&s;e Bal&s;amics pretend to: it is attended with none (of the Inconveniences they produce; and has all the good Qualities a&s;cribed to them. Notwith&s;tanding which, it mu&s;t not be given while the Inflammation exi&s;ts; nor when it may revive again; and no other Aliment &s;hould be mix|ed with the Milk.</P>
<P>The famous Medicine called the <HI>Antihectic, (Antihecticum Poterii)</HI> has not, any more than the&s;e Bal&s;amics, the Virtues a&s;cribed to it in &s;uch Ca&s;es. I very often give it in &s;ome ob&s;tinate Coughs to Infants with their Milk, and then it is very u&s;eful: but I have &s;el|dom &s;een it attended with con&s;iderable Effects in grown Per&s;ons; and in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;es I &s;hould be fearful of its doing Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="012243_0072_0F8A6B61CCA5ABC0">&sect; 84. If the <HI>Vomica,</HI> in&s;tead of breaking within the Sub&s;tance of the Lungs affected, &s;hould break without it, the Pus mu&s;t be re|ceived into the Cavity of the Brea&s;t. We know when that has happened, by the Sen&s;ation or Feeling of the Patient; who per|ceives an uncommon, a &s;ingular Kind of Movement, pretty ge|nerally accompanied with a Fainting. The Oppre&s;&s;ion and An|gui&s;h cea&s;e at once; the Fever abates; the Cough however com|monly continues, tho' with le&s;s Violence, and without any Ex|pectoration. But this &s;eeming Amendment is of a &s;hort Duration, &s;ince from the daily Augmentation of the Matter, and its growing more acrid or &s;harp, the Lungs become oppre&s;&s;ed, irritated and eroded. The Difficulty of Breathing, Heat, Third, Wakeful|ne&s;s, Di&s;ta&s;te, and Deafne&s;s return, with many other Symptoms unnece&s;&s;ary to be enumerated, and e&s;pecially with frequent Sink|ings and Weakne&s;s. The Patient &s;hould be confined to his Regi|men, to retard the Increa&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e as much as po&s;&s;ible; notwith&s;tanding no other effectual Remedy remains, except that of opening the Brea&s;t between two of the Ribs, to di&s;charge the Matter, and to &s;top the Di&s;order it occa&s;ions. This is called the Operation for the <HI>Empyema.</HI> I &s;hall not de&s;cribe it here, as it &s;hould not be undertaken but by Per&s;ons of Capacity and Experi|ence, for whom this Treati&s;e was not intended. I would only ob|&s;erve, it is le&s;s painful than terrifying; and that if it is delayed too long, it proves u&s;ele&s;s, and the Patient dies mi&s;erably.</P>
<P>&sect; 85. We may daily &s;ee external Inflammations turn gangre|nous, or mortify. The &s;ame thing occurs in the Lungs, when the Fever is exce&s;&s;ive, the Inflammation, either in its own Nature, extremely violent, or rai&s;ed to &s;uch a Height by hot Medicines. Intolerable Angui&s;h, extreme Weakne&s;s, frequent Faintings, Coldne&s;s of the Extremities, a livid and foetid thin Humour brought up in&s;tead of concocted Spitting, and &s;ometimes black|i&s;h Stripes on the Brea&s;t, &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h this mi&s;erable State. I have &s;melt in one Ca&s;e of this Kind, where the Patient had been attacked with this Di&s;ea&s;e (after a forced March on Foot, having taken &s;ome Wine with Spices to force a Sweat) his Breath &s;o horribly, &s;tinking, that his Wife had many Sinkings from attending him. When I &s;aw him, I could di&s;cern neither Pul&s;e nor Intellect, and ordered him nothing. He died an Hour afterwards, about the Beginning of the third Hour.</P>
<P>&sect; 86. An Inflammation may al&s;o become hard, when it forms what we call a <HI>Scirrhus,</HI> which is a very hard Tumour, indolent, or unpainful. This is known to occur, when the Di&s;ea&s;e has not terminated in any of tho&s;e Manners I have repre&s;ented; and where, tho' the Fever and the other Symptoms di&s;appear, the Re&s;piration, or Breathing, remains always a little oppre&s;&s;ed; the Patient &s;till retains a trouble&s;ome Sen&s;ation in one Side of his Brea&s;t; and has from time to time a dry Cough, which increa|&s;es after Exerci&s;e, and after eating, This Malady is but &s;eldom
<PB N="53" REF="012243_0073_0F8A6B628B216938">
cured; though &s;ome Per&s;ons attacked with it la&s;t many Years without any other con&s;iderable Complaint. They &s;hould avoid all Occa&s;ions of over-heating them&s;elves; which might readily produce a new Inflammation about this Tumour, the Con&s;equen|ces of which would be highly dangerous.</P>
<P>&sect; 87. The belt Remedies again&s;t this Di&s;order, and from which I have &s;een &s;ome good Effects, are the medicated Whey No. 17, and the Pills No. 18. The Patient may take twenty Pills, and a Pint and a half of the Whey every Morning for a long Continu|ance; and receive inwardly, now and then, the Vapour of hot Water.</P>
<P>&sect; 88. Each Lung, in a perfect State of Health, touches the <HI>Pleura,</HI> the Membrane, that lines the In&s;ide of the Brea&s;t; though it is not connected to it. But it often happens, after an Inflam|mation of the Brea&s;t, after a Pleuri&s;y, and in &s;ome other Ca&s;es, that the&s;e two Parts adhere clo&s;ely to each other, and are never afterwards &s;eparated. However this is &s;carcely to be con&s;idered as a Di&s;ea&s;e; and remains commonly unknown, as the Health is not impaired by it, and nothing is ever pre&s;cribed to remove it. Neverthele&s;s I have &s;een a few Ca&s;es, in which this Adhe&s;ion was manife&s;tly prejudicial.</P>

<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER V. Of the Pleuri&s;y.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 89. THE Pleuri&s;y, which is chiefly known by the&s;e four Symptoms, a &s;trong Fever, a Difficulty of Breathing, a Cough, and an acute Pain about the Brea&s;t; the Pleuri&s;y, I &s;ay, is not a diffe|rent Malady from the Peripneumony, or Inflammation of the Brea&s;t, the Subject of the preceding Chapter; &s;o that I have very little to &s;ay of it, particularly, or apart.</P>
<P>&sect; 90. The Cau&s;e of this Di&s;ea&s;e then is exactly the &s;ame with that of the former, that is, an Inflammation of the Lungs; but an Inflammation, that &s;eems rather a little more external. The only con&s;iderable Difference in the Symptoms is, that the Pleuri|&s;y is accompanied with a mo&s;t acute Pain under the Ribs, and which is commonly termed a <HI>Stitch.</HI> This Pain is felt indifferent|ly over every Part of the Brea&s;t; though more commonly about the Sides, under the more fle&s;hy Parts of the Brea&s;t, and oftene&s;t on the right Side. The Pain is greatly increa&s;ed whenever the Patient coughs, or draws in the Air in breathing; and hence a Dread of increa&s;ing it, (making &s;ome Patients forbear to cough or re&s;pire, as much as they po&s;&s;ibly can) which aggravates the Di&s;ea&s;e, by &s;topping the Cour&s;e of the Blood in the Lungs, that
<PB N="54" REF="012243_0074_0F8A6B635461C218">
are &s;oon overcharged with it. Hence the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">flammation of this Bowel becomes general; the Blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ounts up to the Head; the Countenance looks deeply red, or as it were livid; the Patient becomes nearly &s;uffocated, and falls into the State de&s;cribed &sect; 47.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Pain is &s;o extremely violent, that if the Cough is very urgent at the &s;ame time, and the Sick cannot &s;uppre&s;s or re&s;train it, they are &s;eized with Convul&s;ions, of which I have &s;een many In&s;tances, but the&s;e occur almo&s;t always to Women; though they are much le&s;s &s;ubject than Men to this Di&s;ea&s;e, and indeed to all inflammatory ones. It may be proper however to ob&s;erve here, that if Women &s;hould be attacked with it, during their monthly Di&s;charges, that Circum&s;tance &s;hould not prevent the repeated and nece&s;&s;ary Bleedings, nor occa&s;ion any Altera|tion in the Treatment of the Di&s;ea&s;e. And hence it appears that the Pleuri&s;y is really an Inflammation of the Lungs, accompanied with acute Pain,</P>
<P>&sect; 91. I am &s;en&s;ible that &s;ometimes an Inflammation of the Lungs is communicated al&s;o to that Membrane, which, lining the In&s;ide of the Brea&s;t, is called the <HI>Pleura</HI>; and from thence to the Mu&s;cles, the fle&s;hy Parts, over and between the Ribs. This how|ever is not very frequently the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; 92. Spring is commonly the Sea&s;on mo&s;t productive of Pleu|ri&s;ies: in general there are few in Summer: notwith&s;tanding that in the Year 1762, there were a great many during the hot|te&s;t Sea&s;on, which then was exce&s;&s;ively &s;o. The Di&s;ea&s;e u&s;ually begins with a violent Shivering, &s;ucceeded by a con&s;iderable Heat, with a Cough, and Oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;ometimes with a &s;en|&s;ible Straitning, or Contraction, as it were, all over the Brea&s;t; and al&s;o with a Head-ach, a Redne&s;s of the Cheeks, and with Reachings to vomit. The Stitch does not always happen at the very fir&s;t On&s;et; often not till &s;everal Hours from the fir&s;t Com|plaint; &s;ometimes not before the &s;econd or even the third Day. Sometimes the Patient feels two Stitches, in different Parts of the Side; though it &s;eldom happens that they are equally &s;harp, and the lighte&s;t &s;oon cea&s;es. Sometimes al&s;o the Stitch &s;hifts its Place, which promi&s;es well if the Part fir&s;t attacked by it continues per|fectly free from Pain: but it has a bad Appearance, if, while the fir&s;t is pre&s;ent, another al&s;o &s;upervenes, and both continue. The Pul&s;e is u&s;ually very hard in this Di&s;temper; but in the dreadful Ca&s;es de&s;cribed &sect; 47 and 90, it becomes &s;oft and &s;mall. There often occurs at, or very quickly after, the Inva&s;ion, &s;uch an Ex|pectoration, or hawking up, as happens in an Inflammation of the Brea&s;t; at other Times there is not the lea&s;t Appearance of it, whence &s;uch are named dry Pleuri&s;ies, which happen pretty often. Sometimes the Sick cough but little or not at all. They often lie more at Ea&s;e upon the Side affected, than on the &s;ound one. The Progre&s;s of this Di&s;ea&s;e advances exactly like that de&s;cribed in the preceding Chapter; for how can they differ con&s;iderably? and the Treatment of both is the &s;ame. Large Haemorrhages,
<PB N="55" REF="012243_0075_0F8A6B642E278958">
or Bleedings from the No&s;e, frequently happen, to the great Re|lief of the Patient; but &s;ometimes &s;uch Di&s;charges con&s;i&s;t of a kind of corrupted Blood, when the Patient is very ill, and the&s;e portend Death.</P>
<P>&sect; 93. This Di&s;temper is often produced by drinking cold Wa|ter, while a Per&s;on is hot; from which Cau&s;e it is &s;ometimes &s;o violent, as to kill the Patient in three Hours. A young Man was found dead at the Side of the Spring, from which he had quenched his Thir&s;t: neither indeed is it uncommon for Pleuri|&s;ies to prove mortal within three Days.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Stitch di&s;appears, whence the Patient complains le&s;s; but at the &s;ame Time his Countenance changes; he grows pale and &s;ad; his Eyes look dull and heavy, and his Pul&s;e grows feeble. This &s;ignifies a Tran&s;lation of the Di&s;ea&s;e to the Brain, a Ca&s;e which is almo&s;t con&s;tantly fatal.</P>
<P>There is no Di&s;ea&s;e in which the critical Symptoms are more violent, and more &s;trongly marked, than in this. It is proper this &s;hould be known, as it may prevent or le&s;&s;en our exce&s;&s;ive Terror. A perfect Cure &s;upervenes &s;ometimes, at the very Mo|ment when Death was expected.</P>
<P>&sect; 94. This Malady is one of the mo&s;t common and the mo&s;t de&s;troying kind, as well from its own violent Nature, as through the pernicious Treatment of it in Country Places That Preju|dice which in&s;i&s;ts on curing all Di&s;ea&s;es by Sweating, entirely regulates their Conduct in treating a Pleuri&s;y; and as &s;oon as a Per&s;on is afflicted with a Stitch, all the hot Medicines are imme|diately &s;et to work. This mortal Error de&s;troys more People than Gunpowder; and it is by &s;o much the more hurtful, as the Di&s;temper is of the mo&s;t violent kind; and becau&s;e, as there is commonly not a Moment to be lo&s;t, the whole depends on the Method immediately recurred to.</P>
<P>&sect; 95. The proper Manner of treating this Di&s;ea&s;e is exactly the &s;ame in all Re&s;pects, with that of the Peripneumony; becau&s;e, I again affirm, it is the very &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e. Hence the Bleedings, the &s;oftening and diluting Drinks, the Steams, the Gly&s;ters, the Potion No. 8, and the emolient Poultices are the real Remedies. The&s;e la&s;t perhaps are &s;till more effectual in the Pleuri&s;y; and therefore they &s;hould be continually applied over the very Stitch.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Bleeding, e&s;pecially if there has been a con&s;iderable Di&s;charge, almo&s;t con&s;tantly abates the Stitch, and often entirely removes it: though it more commonly returns after an Intermi&s;|&s;ion of &s;ome Hours, either in the &s;ame Spot, or &s;ometimes in an|other. This &s;hifting of it is rather favourable, e&s;pecially if the Pain, that was fir&s;t felt under the Brea&s;t, &s;hifts into the Shoul|ders to the Back, the Shoulder-blade, or the Nape of the Neck.</P>
<P>When the Stitch is not at all abated, or only a little; or if, after having abated, it returns as violently as at fir&s;t, and e&s;peci|ally if it returns in the &s;ame Spot, and the Height of the other Symptoms continues, Bleeding mu&s;t be repeated. But if a &s;en&s;i|ble
<PB N="56" REF="012243_0076_0F8A6B64CF404048">
Abatement of the Stitch continues; and if, though it returns, it &s;hould be in a &s;maller Degree, and by Intervals, or in tho&s;e Places I have mentioned above; if the Quickne&s;s, or the Hardne&s;s of the Pul&s;e, and all the other Symptoms are &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hed, this repeated Bleeding may &s;ometimes be omitted. Neverthele&s;s, in a very &s;trong Subject, it &s;eems rather prudent not to omit it, &s;ince in &s;uch Circum&s;tances it can do no Mi&s;chief; and a con&s;i|derable Hazard may &s;ometimes be incurred by the Omi&s;&s;ion. In very high and dangerous Pleuri&s;ies a frequent Repetition of bleed|ing is nece&s;&s;ary; except &s;ome Impediment to it &s;hould ari&s;e from the particular Con&s;titution of the Patient, from his Age, or &s;ome other Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>If, from the Beginning of the Di&s;ea&s;e, the Pul&s;e is but a little quicker and harder than in a healthy State; if it is not manife&s;tly &s;trong; if the Head-ach and the Stitch are &s;o moderate as to prove &s;upportable; if the Cough is not too violent; if there is no &s;en&s;ible Oppre&s;&s;ion or Straitne&s;s, and the Patient expectorate, or cough up, Bleeding may be omitted.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the admini&s;tering of other Remedies, the &s;ame Directions are to be exactly followed, which have been already given in the preceding Chapter, to which the Reader is referred from &sect; 53 to 66.</P>
<P>&sect; 96. When the Di&s;ea&s;e is not very acute or pre&s;&s;ing, I have often cured it in a very few Days by a &s;ingle Bleeding, and a large Quantity of a Tea or Infu&s;ion of Elder-flowers, &s;weetened with Honey. It is in &s;ome Ca&s;es of this Kind, that we often find the Water <HI>Faltranc</HI> to &s;ucceed, with the Addition of &s;ome Honey, and even of Oil: though the Drink I have ju&s;t directed is con&s;i|derably preferable. That Drink which is compounded of equal Quantities of Wine and Water, with the Addition of much Venice Treacle, annually de&s;troys a great Number of People in the Coun|try.</P>
<P>&sect; 97. In tho&s;e dry Pleuri&s;ies, in which the Stitch, the Fever, and the Head-ach are &s;trong and violent; and where the Pul&s;e is very hard and very full, with an exce&s;&s;ive Dryne&s;s of the Skin and of the Tongue, Bleeding &s;hould be frequently repeated, and at &s;mall Intervals from each other. This Method frequently cures the Di&s;ea&s;e effectually, without u&s;ing any other Evacuation.</P>
<P>&sect; 98. The Pleuri&s;y terminates, like any other inward Inflam|mation, either by &s;ome Evacuation; by an Ab&s;ce&s;s; in a Morti|fication; or in a Scirrho&s;ity or hard Tumour; and it often leaves Adhe&s;ions in the Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Gangrene or Mortification &s;ometimes appears on the third Day, without having been preceded by very vehement Pains. In &s;uch Ca&s;es the Body after Death often looks very black, e&s;pecially in the Parts near the Seat of the Di&s;ea&s;e; and in &s;uch the more &s;uper&s;titious a&s;cribe it to &s;ome &s;upernatural Cau&s;e; or draw &s;ome unhappy Pre&s;age from it, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who are yet unat|tacked by it. This Appearance however is purely a natural Con|&s;equence,
<PB N="57" REF="012243_0077_0F8A6B6590312440">
quite &s;imple, and cannot be otherwi&s;e; and the hot Regimen and Medicines are the mo&s;t prevailing Cau&s;es of it. I have &s;een it thus circum&s;tanced in a Man in the Flower of his Age, who had taken Venice Treacle in Cherry Water, and the Ingredients of <HI>Faltranc</HI> infu&s;ed in Wine.</P>
<P>&sect; 99. <HI>Vomicas</HI> are &s;ometimes the Con&s;equence of Pleuri&s;ies; but their particular Situation di&s;po&s;es them more to break <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is, undoubtedly, Baron <HI>Van Swieten,</HI> with whom he had premi&s;ed, he agreed con&s;iderably, in all the Di&s;ea&s;es they had both treated of. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> out|wardly; which is the mo&s;t frequent Cau&s;e of an <HI>Empyema</HI> &sect; 84.
<Q>To prevent this, it is highly proper to apply, at the fir&s;t In|va&s;ion of the Di&s;ea&s;e, to the Spot where the Pain chiefly rages, a &s;mall Plai&s;ter, which may exactly fit it; &s;ince if the Pleuri&s;y &s;hould terminate in an Ab&s;ce&s;s or Impo&s;thume, the purulent Matter will be determined to that Side.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As &s;oon then as it is fore&s;een that an Ab&s;ce&s;s is forming (&s;ee &sect; 68) we &s;hould erode, by a light Cau&s;tic, the Place where it is expected; and as &s;oon as it is removed, Care &s;hould be ta|ken to promote Suppuration there. By this Means we may en|tertain a rea&s;onable Hope, that the Ma&s;s of Matter will incline its Cour&s;e to that Spot, where it will meet with the lea&s;t Re|&s;i&s;tance, and be di&s;charged from thence. For this Heap of Matter is often accumulated between the <HI>Pleura,</HI> and the Parts which adhere to it.</Q></P>
<P>This is the Advice of a very great <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That is, into the Cavity of the Brea&s;t, rather than within the Sub&s;tance of the Lungs.</NOTE> Phy&s;ician; but I mu&s;t in|form the Reader, there are many Ca&s;es, in which it can be of no Service; neither ought it to be attempted, but by Per&s;ons of un|doubted Abilities.</P>
<P>With Regard to Scirrho&s;ity, or Hardne&s;s, and to the Circum|&s;tances of Adhe&s;ions, I can add nothing to what I have &s;aid in &sect; 86 and 87.</P>
<P>&sect; 100. It has been ob&s;erved that &s;ome Per&s;ons, who have been once attacked by this Di&s;ea&s;e, are often liable to Relap&s;es of it, e&s;pecially &s;uch as drink hard. I knew one Man who reckoned up his Pleuri&s;ies by Dozens. A few Bleedings, at certain proper In|tervals, might prevent the&s;e frequent Returns of it; which, join|ed to their exce&s;&s;ive Drinking, make them languid and &s;tupid, in the very Flower of their Age. They generally fall into &s;ome Spe|cies of an A&s;thma, and from that into a Drop&s;y, which proves the melancholly, though not an improper Conclu&s;ion of their Lives. Such as can confine them&s;elves to &s;ome proper Precau|tions may al&s;o prevent the&s;e frequent Returns of this Di&s;ea&s;e, even without Bleeding; by a temperate Regimen; by ab&s;taining from time to time, from eating Fle&s;h and drinking Wine; at which times they &s;hould drink Whey, or &s;ome of tho&s;e Diet-drinks, No. 1. 2.
<PB N="58" REF="012243_0078_0F8A6B6794B6E310">
4; and by bathing their Legs &s;ometimes in warm Water; e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Sea&s;ons when this Di&s;ea&s;e is the mo&s;t likely to return.</P>
<P>&sect; 101. Two Medicines greatly e&s;teemed in this Di&s;ea&s;e among the Pea&s;antry, and even extolled by &s;ome Phy&s;icians, are the Blood of a wild He-Goat, and the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, with great Probability, means that &s;mall black Sub&s;tance often vi&s;i|ble in a rotten Egg, which is undoubtedly of a violent, or even poi&s;onous Qua|lity.

I do not conte&s;t the Cure or Recovery of many Per&s;ons, who have taken the&s;e Remedies; notwith&s;tanding it is not le&s;s true, that both of them, as well as the Egg in which the Soot is taken, are dange|rous; for which Rea&s;on it is prudent, at lea&s;t, never to make u&s;e of them; as there is great Probability, they may do a little Mi&s;chief; and a Certainty that they can do no good. The <HI>Ge|nipi,</HI> or <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Lewis,</HI> who has not taken Notice of this Species of Wormwood in his Improvement of <HI>Quincy</HI>'s Di&s;pen&s;atory, has mentioned it in his late <HI>Materia Medica.</HI> K.</NOTE> Wormwood of the Alps, has al&s;o acquired great Repu|tation in this Di&s;ea&s;e, and occa&s;ioned many Di&s;putes between &s;ome very zealous Eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and a ju&s;tly celebrated Phy&s;ician. It &s;eems not difficult however to a&s;certain the proper U&s;e of it. This Plant is a powerful Bitter; it heats and excites Sweat: it &s;eems clear, that from &s;uch Con&s;equences, it &s;hould never be em|ployed in a Pleuri&s;y, while the Ve&s;&s;els are full, the Pul&s;e hard, the Fever high, and the Blood inflamed. In all &s;uch Circum&s;tan|ces it mu&s;t aggravate the Di&s;ea&s;e; but towards the Conclu&s;ion of it, when the Ve&s;&s;els are con&s;iderably emptied, the Blood is dilut|ed, and the Fever abated, it may then be recurred to; but with a con&s;tant Recollection that it is hot, and not to be employed without Reflection and Prudence. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This being a proper Place for directing the Seneka Rattle Snake Root, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that the be&s;t Way of exhibiting it is in Decoction, by gradually &s;immering and boiling two Ounces of it in gro&s;s Powder, in two Pints and a half of water, to a Pint and a Quarter; and then giving three Spoonfuls of it to a grown Per&s;on, every &s;ix Hours. If the Stitch &s;hould continue, or return, after taking it, Bleeding, which &s;hould be premi&s;ed to it, mu&s;t be occa&s;ionally repeated; though it &s;eldom proves nece&s;&s;ary, after a few Do&s;es of it. It great|ly promotes Expectoration, keeps the Body gently open, and &s;ometimes operates by Urine and by Sweat; very &s;eldom proving at all emetic in Decoction. The Regimen of Drinks directed here in Pleuri&s;ies is to be ob&s;erved as u&s;ual Dr. <HI>Tennant,</HI> the Introducer of this valuable Medicine, confided &s;olely in it, in Ba&s;|tard Peripneumonies, without Bleeding, Bli&s;tering, or any other Medicines. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VI. Of the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Throat.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 102. THE Throat is &s;ubject to many Di&s;ea&s;es: one of the mo&s;t frequent and the mo&s;t dangerous, is that Inflammation of it, commonly termed a Quin&s;ey. This in Effect is a Di&s;temper of the &s;ame Nature with an Inflammation of the Brea&s;t; but as it occurs in a different Part, the Symptoms, of cour&s;e, are very different. They al&s;o vary, and not a little, according to the dif|ferent Parts of the Throat which are inflamed.</P>
<P>&sect; 103. The general Symptoms of an Inflammation of the Throat are, the Shivering, the &s;ub&s;equent Heat, the Fever, the Head-ach, red high-coloured Urine, a con&s;iderable Difficulty, and &s;ometimes even an Impo&s;&s;ibility, of &s;wallowing any Thing what&s;oever. But if the neare&s;t Parts to the <HI>Glottis,</HI> that is, of the Enterance into the Windpipe or Conduit through which we breath, are attacked, Breathing becomes exce&s;&s;ively difficult; the Patient is &s;en&s;ible of extreme Angui&s;h, and great Approaches to Suffocation; the Di&s;ea&s;e is then extended to the <HI>Glottis,</HI> to the Bo|dy of the Wind-pipe, and even to the Sub&s;tance of the Lungs, whence it becomes &s;peedily fatal.</P>
<P>The Inflammation of the other Parts is attended with le&s;s Dan|ger: and this Danger becomes &s;till le&s;s, as the Di&s;ea&s;e is more extend|ed to the outward and &s;uperficial parts. When the Inflammation is general, and &s;eizes all the internal Parts of the Throat, and particularly the Ton&s;ils or Almonds, as they are called, the <HI>U|vula,</HI> or Proce&s;s of the Palate, and the <HI>Ba&s;is,</HI> or remote&s;t, deepe&s;t Part of the Tongue, it is one of the mo&s;t dangerous and dreadful Maladies. The Face is then &s;welled up and enflamed; the whole In&s;ide of the Throat is in the &s;ame Condition; the Patient can get nothing down; he breathes with a Pain and Angui&s;h, which concur, with a Stuffing or Ob&s;truction in his Brain, to throw him into a Kind of furious <HI>Delirium,</HI> or Raving. His Tongue is bloated up, and is extended out of his Mouth; his No&s;trils are dilated, as tho' it were to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his Breathing; the whole Neck, e|ven to the Beginning of the Brea&s;t, is exce&s;&s;ively tumified or &s;well|ed up; the Pul&s;e is very quick, very weak, and often intermits; the mi&s;erable Patient is deprived of all his Strength, and common|ly dies the &s;econd or third Day. Very fortunately this Kind, or Degree of it, which I have often &s;een in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> happens very rarely in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> where the Di&s;ea&s;e is le&s;s violent: and where I have only &s;een People die of it, in Con&s;equence of its being per|niciou&s;ly treated; or by rea&s;on of &s;ome accidental Circum&s;tances,
<PB N="60" REF="012243_0080_0F8A6B69C85C9448">
which were foreign to the Di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf. Of the Multitude of Pa|tients I have attended in this Di&s;order, I have known but one to fail under it, who&s;e Ca&s;e I &s;hall mention towards the Clo&s;e of this Chapter.</P>
<P>&sect; 104. Sometimes the Di&s;ea&s;e &s;hifts from the internal to the external Parts: the Skin of the Neck and Brea&s;t grows very red, and becomes painful, but the Patient finds him&s;elf better.</P>
<P>At other Times the Di&s;order quits the Throat, but is transferred to the Brain, or upon the Lungs. Both the&s;e Tran&s;lations of it are mortal, when the be&s;t Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance cannot be imme|diately procured; and it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that even the be&s;t are often ineffectual.</P>
<P>&sect; 105. The mo&s;t u&s;ual Kind of this Di&s;ea&s;e is that which af|fects only the Ton&s;ils (the Almonds) and the Palate, or rather its Proce&s;s, the <HI>Uvula, commonly called</HI> the Palate. It generally fir&s;t invades one of the Ton&s;ils, which becomes enlarged, red and painful, and does not allow the afflicted to &s;wallow, but with great Pain. Sometimes the Di&s;order is confined to one Side; but mo&s;t com|monly it is extended to the <HI>Uvula,</HI> (the Palate) from whence it is extended to the other Ton&s;il. If it be of a mild Kind, the Ton|&s;il fir&s;t affected is generally better, when the &s;econd is attacked. Whenever they are both attacked at once, the Pain and the An|gui&s;h of the Patient are very con&s;iderable; he cannot &s;wallow, but with great Difficulty and Complaint, and the Torment of this is &s;o vehement, that I have &s;een Women affected with Con|vul&s;ions, as often as they endeavoured to &s;wallow their Spittle, or any other Liquid. They continue, even for &s;everal Hours &s;ome|times, unable to take any thing whatever; all the upper inward Part of the Mouth, the Bottom of the Palate, and the de&s;cend|ing Part of the Tongue become lightly red, or inflamed.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable Proportion of Per&s;ons under this Di&s;ea&s;e &s;wallow Liquids more difficultly than Solids; by rea&s;on that Liquids re|quire a greater Action of &s;ome Part of the Mu&s;cles, in order to their being properly directed into their Conduit or Chanel. The De|glutition (the Swallowing) of the Spittle is attended with &s;till more Unea&s;ine&s;s than that of other Liquids; becau&s;e it is a little more thick and vi&s;cid, and flows down with le&s;s Ea&s;e. This Difficulty of &s;wallowing, joined to the Quantity thence accumulated, produces that almo&s;t continual hawking up, which oppre&s;&s;es &s;ome Patients &s;o much the more, as the In&s;ide of their Cheeks, their whole Tongue, and their Lips are often galled, and even &s;tead as it were. This al&s;o prevents their Sleeping, which however &s;eems no con&s;iderable Evil; Sleep being <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> but of little Service in Di&s;ea&s;es attended with a Fever; and I have often &s;een tho&s;e, who thought their Throats almo&s;t entirely well in the Evening, and yet found them very bad after &s;ome Hours Sleep.</P>
<P>The Fever in this Species of the Di&s;ea&s;e, is &s;ometimes very high; and the Shivering often endures for many Hours. It is &s;ucceeded by con&s;iderable Heat, and a violent Head-ach, which
<PB N="61" REF="012243_0081_0F8A6B6A56646818">
yet is &s;ometimes attended with a Drow&s;ine&s;s. The Fever is com|monly pretty high in the Evening, though &s;ometimes but incon&s;i|derable, and by the Morning perhaps there is none at all.</P>
<P>A light Inva&s;ion of this Di&s;ea&s;e of the Throat often precedes the Shivering; though mo&s;t commonly it does not become manife&s;t 'till after it, and at the &s;ame time when the Heat comes on.</P>
<P>The Neck is &s;ometimes a little inflated, or puffed up; and many of the Sick complain of a pretty &s;mart Pain in the Ear of that Side, which is mo&s;t affected. I have but very &s;eldom ob&s;erved that they had it in both.</P>
<P>&sect; 106. The Inflammation either di&s;appears by Degrees, or an Ab&s;ce&s;s is formed in the Part which was chiefly affected. It has never happened, at lea&s;t within my Knowledge, that this Sort of the Di&s;ea&s;e, prudently treated, has ever terminated either in a Mortification, or a Scirrhus: but I have been a Witne&s;s to either of the&s;e &s;upervening, when Sweating was extorted in the Begin|ing of it, by hot Medicines.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o very rare to meet with tho&s;e highly dangerous Tran&s;|lations of this Di&s;ea&s;e upon the Lungs, &s;uch as are de&s;cribed in that Species of it from &sect; 103, 104. It is true indeed they do not occur more frequently, even in that Species there de&s;cribed, when|ever the Di&s;ea&s;e is thrown out upon the more external Parts.</P>
<P>&sect; 107. The Treatment of the Quin&s;ey, as well as of all other inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;es, is the &s;ame with that of an Inflammation of the Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Sick is immediately to be put upon a Regimen; and in that Sort de&s;cribed &sect; 103, Bleeding mu&s;t be repeated four or five Times within a few Hours; and &s;ometimes there is a Nece&s;&s;ity to recur &s;till oftner to it. When it a&s;&s;aults the Patient in the mo&s;t vehement Degree, all Medicines, all Means, are very generally ineffectual: they &s;hould be tried however. We &s;hould give as much as can be taken of the Drinks No. 2. and 4. But as the Quantity they are able to &s;wallow is often very incon&s;iderable; the Gly&s;ter No. 5 &s;hould be repeated every three Hours; and their Legs &s;hould be put into a Bath of warm Water, thrice a Day.</P>
<P>&sect; 108. Cupping Gla&s;&s;es, with Scarification, applied about the Neck, after bleeding twice or thrice, have often been experienced to be highly u&s;eful. In the mo&s;t de&s;perate Ca&s;es, when the Neck is exce&s;&s;ively &s;welled, one ot two deep Inci&s;ions made with a Ra|zor, on this external Tumour, have &s;ometimes &s;aved a Patient's Life.</P>
<P>&sect; 109. In that Kind, and tho&s;e Circum&s;tances, of this Di&s;ea&s;e de&s;cribed &sect; 105, we mu&s;t have very frequent Recour&s;e to Bleed|ing; and it &s;hould never be omitted, when the Pul&s;e is very per|ceivably hard and full. It is of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to do it in&s;tantly; &s;ince it is the only Means to prevent the Ab&s;ce&s;s, which forms very readily, if Bleeding has been neglected, only for a
<PB N="62" REF="012243_0082_0F8A6B6C6D2B9558">
few Hours. Sometimes it is nece&s;&s;ary to repeat it a &s;econd time, but very rarely a third.</P>
<P>This Di&s;ea&s;e is frequently &s;o gentle and mild, as to be cured without Bleeding, by the Means of much good Management. But as many as are not Ma&s;ters of their own time, nor in &s;uch an ea&s;y Situation as to be properly attended, ought, without the lea&s;t He&s;itation, to be bled directly, which is &s;ometimes &s;ufficient to remove the Complaint; e&s;pecially if, after Bleeding, the Patient drinks plentifully of the Pti&s;an No. 2.</P>
<P>In this light Degree of the Di&s;ea&s;e, it may &s;uffice to bath the Legs, and al&s;o to receive a Gly&s;ter, once a Day; the fir&s;t to be u&s;ed in the Morning, and the la&s;t in the Evening. Be&s;ides the general Remedies again&s;t Inflammations, a few particular ones, calculated preci&s;ely for this Di&s;ea&s;e, may be applied in each Kind or Degree of it. The bell are, fir&s;t the emollient Poultices, No. 9, laid over the whole Neck. <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> avail them&s;elves con&s;iderably in this Di&s;ea&s;e, of a Mixture of equal Parts of Sallad Oil and Spirit of Sal Ammoniac, or of Oil and Spirit of Hart&s;horn, as a Liniment and Application round the Neck. This Remedy cor|re&s;ponds with many Indications; and de&s;erves, perhaps, the fir&s;t Place among&s;t local Applications again&s;t the inflammatory Quin&s;ey. <HI>E.

<P>3. The Steam of hot Water, as directed &sect; 55, &s;hould be repeat|ed five or &s;ix times a Day; a Poultice &s;hould be con&s;tantly kept on, and often renewed; and the Patient &s;hould frequently gargle.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Per&s;ons, be&s;ides Children, who cannot gargle them&s;elves: and in fact the Pain occa&s;ioned by it makes it the more difficult. In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, in&s;tead of gargling, the &s;ame Gargari&s;m (No. 19.) may be injected with a &s;mall Syringe. The Injection reaches farther than Gargling, and often cau&s;es the Pa|tient to hawk up a con&s;iderable Quantity of glairy Matter (which has grown &s;till thicker towards the Bottom of the Throat) to his &s;en&s;ible Relief. This Injection &s;hould be often repeated. The little hollowed Pipes of Elder-Wood, which all the Children in the Country can make, may be conveniently employed for this Pur|po&s;e. The Patient &s;hould breathe out, rather than in&s;pire, during the Injection.</P>
<P>&sect; 110. Whenever the Di&s;ea&s;e terminates without Suppuration, the Fever, the Head-ach, the Heat in the Throat, and the Pain in

&s;wallowing, begin to abate from the fourth Day, &s;ometimes from the third, often only from the fifth; and from &s;uch Period that Abatement increa&s;es at a great Rate, &s;o that at the End of two, three, or four Days, on the &s;ixth, &s;eventh, or eighth, the Pa|tient is entirely well. Some few however continue to feel a light Degree of Pain, and that only on one Side, four or five Days longer, but without a Fever, or any con&s;iderable Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; 111. Sometimes the Fever and the other Symptoms abate, after the Bleeding and other Remedies; without any &s;ub&s;equent Amendment in the Throat, or any Signs of Suppuration. In &s;uch Ca&s;es we mu&s;t chiefly per&s;i&s;t in the Gargari&s;ms and the Steams; and where an experienced and dexterous Surgeon can be procur|ed, it were proper he &s;hould &s;carify the inflamed Ton&s;ils. The&s;e di&s;charge, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, a moderate Quantity of Blood; and this Evacuation relieves, very readily, as many as make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>&sect; 112. If the Inflammation is in no ways di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;per&s;e, &s;o that an Ab&s;ce&s;s is forming, which almo&s;t ever happens, if it has not been obviated at the Inva&s;ion of the Di&s;ea&s;e; then the Symp|toms attending the Fever continue, though raging a little le&s;s af|ter the fourth Day: the Throat continues red, but of a le&s;s florid and lively Redne&s;s: a Pain al&s;o continues, though le&s;s acute, ac|companied &s;ometimes with Pul&s;ations, and at other times entirely without any, of which it is proper to take Notice: the Pul&s;e com|monly grows a little &s;ofter; and on the fifth or &s;ixth Day, and &s;ometimes &s;ooner, the Ab&s;ce&s;s is ready to break. This may be di&s;covered by the Appearance of a &s;mall white and &s;oft Tumour, when the Mouth is open, which commonly appears about the Cen|ter or Middle of the Inflammation. It bur&s;ts of it&s;elf; or, &s;hould it not, it mu&s;t be opened. This is effected by &s;trongly &s;ecuring a Lancet to one End of a &s;mall Stick or Handle, and enveloping, or wrapping up the whole Blade of it, except the Point and the Length of one fourth or a third of an Inch, in &s;ome Folds of &s;oft Linen; after which the Ab&s;ce&s;s is pierced with the Point of this Lancet. The in&s;tant it is opened, the Mouth is filled with the Di&s;charge of a Quantity of <HI>Pus,</HI> of the mo&s;t intolerable Savour and Smell. The Patient &s;hould gargle him&s;elf, after the Di&s;|charge of it, with the deter&s;ive, or clean&s;ing Gargari&s;m No. 19. It is &s;urprizing &s;ometimes to &s;ee the Quantity of Matter di&s;charg|ed from this Impo&s;thumation. In general there is but one; tho' &s;ometimes I have &s;een two of them.</P>
<P>&sect; 113. It happens, and not &s;eldom, that the Matter is not col|lected exactly in the Place, where the Inflammation appeared, but in &s;ome le&s;s expo&s;ed and le&s;s vi&s;ible Place; whence a Facility of &s;wallowing is almo&s;t entirely re&s;tored; the Fever abates; the Pa|tient &s;leeps; he imagines he is cured, and that no Inconvenience remains, but &s;uch as ordinarily occurs in the earlie&s;t Stage of Re|covery. A Per&s;on who is neither a Phy&s;ician, nor a Surgeon, may ea&s;ily deceive him&s;elf, when in this State: but the following Signs may enable him to di&s;cover that there is an Ab&s;ce&s;s, viz. A
<PB N="64" REF="012243_0084_0F8A6B7023B5A1D0">
certain Inquietude and general Unea&s;ine&s;s; a Pain throughout the Mouth; &s;ome Shiverings from time to time: frequently &s;harp, but &s;hort and tran&s;ient, Heat; a Pul&s;e moderately &s;oft, but not in a natural State; a Sen&s;ation of Thickne&s;s and Heavine&s;s in the Tongue; &s;mall white Eruptions on the Gums, on the In&s;ide of the Cheek, on the In&s;ide and Out&s;ide of the Lips, and a di&s;agree|able Ta&s;t and Odour.</P>
<P>&sect; 114. In &s;uch Ca&s;es Milk or warm Water &s;hould frequently be retained in the Mouth; the Vapour of hot Water &s;hould be conveyed into it; and emollient Catapla&s;ms may be applied about the Neck. All the&s;e Means concur to the &s;oftening and breaking of the Ab&s;ce&s;s. The Finger may al&s;o be introduced to feel for its Situation, and when di&s;covered, the Surgeon may ea&s;ily open it. I happened once to break one under my Finger, without hav|ing made the lea&s;t Effort to do it. Warm Water may be injected pretty forcibly, either by the Mouth or the No&s;trils: this &s;ometimes occa&s;ions a Kind of Cough, or certain Efforts which tend to break it, and which I have &s;een happen even from laughing. As to the re&s;t, the Patient &s;hould not be too anxious or unea&s;y about the E|vent. I never &s;aw a &s;ingle In&s;tance of a Per&s;on's dying of a Quin|&s;ey of this Kind, after the Suppuration is truly effected; neither has it happened perhaps after the Time it is forming for Suppuration.</P>
<P>&sect; 115. The glairy Matter with which the Throat is overcharg|ed, and the very Inflammation of that Part, which, from its Irri|tation, produces the &s;ame Effect as the Introduction of a Finger into it, occa&s;ions &s;ome Patients to complain of ince&s;&s;ant Propen|&s;ities to vomit. We mu&s;t be upon our Guard here, and not &s;up|po&s;e that this Heart-Sickne&s;s, as &s;ome have called it, re&s;ults from a Di&s;order of, or a Load within, the Stomach, and that it re|quires a Vomit for its Removal. The giving one here would of|ten prove a very unfortunate Mi&s;take. It might, in a high In|flammation, further aggravate it; or we might be obliged (even during the Operation of the Vomit) to bleed, in order to le&s;&s;en the Violence of the Inflammation. Such Imprudence with its bad Con&s;equences, often leaves the Patient, even after the Di&s;|ea&s;e is cured, in a State of Langour and Weakne&s;s for a con&s;ider|able time. Neverthele&s;s, there are &s;ome particular Di&s;orders of the Throat, attended with a Fever, in which a Vomit may be pru|dently given. But this can only be, when there is no Inflamma|tion, or after it is di&s;per&s;ed; and there &s;till remains &s;ome putrid Matter in the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages. Of &s;uch Ca&s;es I &s;hall &s;peak here|after. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">In Di&s;ea&s;es of the Throat, which have been preceded by &s;uch Exce&s;&s;es in Food or &s;trong Drink, as occur too often in many Countries, when the Patient has very &s;trong Reachings to vomit, and the Tongue is moi&s;t at the &s;ame time; we &s;hould not he&s;itate, after appea&s;ing the fir&s;t Symptoms of the Inflammation [by &s;ufficient Bleedings, &amp;c.] to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Efforts of Nature, and to give a &s;mall Do&s;e of Tartar emetic, di&s;&s;olved in &s;ome Spoonfuls of Water. This Reme|dy in this Ca&s;e, promotes the Di&s;per&s;ion of the Inflammation, beyond any o|ther. <HI>E. L.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="012243_0085_0F8A6B7223427188">&sect; 116. We often &s;ee in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland</HI> a Di&s;order different from the&s;e of the Throat, of which we have ju&s;t treated; though, like the&s;e, attended with a Difficulty of &s;wallowing. It is termed in <HI>French</HI> the <HI>Oreillons,</HI> and often the <HI>Ourles,</HI> or &s;welled Ears. It is an Over|fulne&s;s and Ob&s;truction of tho&s;e Glands and their Tubes, which are to furni&s;h the <HI>Saliva</HI> or Spittle; and particularly of the two large Glands which lie between the Ear and the Jaw, which are called the <HI>Parotides</HI>; and of two under the Jaw, called the <HI>Maxil|lares.</HI> All the&s;e being con&s;iderably &s;welled in this Di&s;ea&s;e, do not only produce a great Difficulty of &s;wallowing, but al&s;o prevent the Mouth from opening; as an Attempt to do it is attended with violent Pain. Young Children are much more liable to this Di&s;ea&s;e than grown Per&s;ons. Being &s;eldom attended with a Fe|ver, there is no Occa&s;ion for Medicines: It is &s;ufficient to defend the Part affected from the external Air; to apply &s;ome proper Poultice over them; to le&s;&s;en the Quantity of their Food con&s;i|derably, denying them Fle&s;h and Wine; but indulging them plentifully in &s;ome light warm Liquid, to dilute their Humours and re&s;tore Per&s;piration. I cured my&s;elf of this Di&s;order in 1754, by drinking nothing, for four Days, but Bawm Tea, to which I added one fourth part Milk, and a little Bread. The &s;ame Re|gimen has often cured me of other light Complaints of the Throat.</P>
<P>&sect; 117. In the Spring of 1761, there were an a&s;toni&s;hing Num|ber of Per&s;ons attacked with Di&s;orders of the Throat, of two dif|ferent Kinds. Some of them were &s;eized with that common Sort which I have already de&s;cribed. Without adding any thing more particularly, in re&s;pect to this Species, it happened frequently to grown Per&s;ons, who were perfectly cured by the Method already recited. The other Species, on which I &s;hall be more particular in this Place (becau&s;e I know they have abounded in &s;ome Villa|ges, and were very fatal) invaded Adults, or grown Per&s;ons, al|&s;o; but e&s;pecially Children, from the Age of one Year, and even under that, to the Age of twelve or thirteen.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Symptoms were the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the common Quin&s;ey, &s;uch as the Shivering, the en&s;uing Heat or Fever, De|jection, and a Complaint of the Throat: but the following Symp|toms di&s;tingui&s;hed the&s;e from the common inflammatory Quin&s;eys.</P>
<P>1. The Sick had often &s;omething of a Cough, and a little Op|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>2. The Pul&s;e was quicker, but le&s;s hard, and le&s;s &s;trong, than u&s;ually happens in Di&s;ea&s;es of the Throat.</P>
<P>3. The Patients were afflicted with a &s;harp, &s;tinging and dry Heat, and with great Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>4. They &s;pat le&s;s than is u&s;ual in a common Quin&s;ey: and their Tongues were extremely dry.</P>
<P>5. Though they had &s;ome Pain in &s;wallowing, this was not the principal Complaint, and they could drink &s;ufficiently.</P>
<P>6. The Swelling and Redne&s;s of the Ton&s;ils, of the Palate, and
<PB N="66" REF="012243_0086_0F8A6B73ADB848E0">
of its Proce&s;s were not con&s;iderable; but the parotid and maxil|lary Glands, and e&s;pecially the former, being extremely &s;welled and inflamed, the Pain they chiefly complained of, was this out|ward one.</P>
<P>7. When the Di&s;ea&s;e proved con&s;iderably dangerous, the whole Neck &s;welled; and &s;ometimes even the Veins, which return the Blood from the Brain, being overladen, as it were, the Sick had &s;ome Degree of Drow&s;ine&s;s, and of a <HI>Delirium,</HI> or Raving.</P>
<P>8. The Paroxy&s;ms, or Returns, of the Fever were con&s;iderably irregular.</P>
<P>9. The Urine appeared to be le&s;s inflamed, than in other Di&s;|ea&s;es of the Throat.</P>
<P>10. Bleeding and other Medicines did not relieve them, as &s;oon as in the other Kind; and the Di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf continued a longer time.</P>
<P>11. It did not terminate in a Suppuration like other Quin&s;eys, but &s;ometimes the Ton&s;ils were ulcerated.</P>
<P>12. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;eems to have been the &s;ame kind of Quin&s;ey, of which Drs. <HI>Huxham, Fothergil, Cotton,</HI> and others wrote, tho' under different Appelations. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> Almo&s;t every Child, and indeed a great many of the grown Per&s;ons a&s;&s;aulted with this Di&s;ea&s;e, threw out, either on the fir&s;t Day, or on &s;ome &s;ucceeding one, within the fir&s;t &s;ix Days, a certain Efflore&s;cence, or Eruptions, re&s;embling the Mea|&s;les con&s;iderably in &s;ome, but of a le&s;s lively Colour, and with|out any Elevation, or ri&s;ing above the Skin. It appeared fir&s;t in the Face, next in the Arms, and de&s;cended to the Legs, Thighs and Trunk di&s;appearing gradually at the End of two or three Days, in the &s;ame Order it had ob&s;erved in breaking out. A few others (I have &s;een but five In&s;tances of it) &s;uffered the mo&s;t grievous Symptoms before the Eruption: and threw out the genuine <HI>purpura,</HI> or white miliary Eruption.</P>
<P>13. As &s;oon as the&s;e Efflore&s;cences or Eruptions appeared, the Sick generally found them&s;elves better. That, la&s;t mentioned, continued four, five, or &s;ix Days, and frequently went off by Sweats. Such as had not the&s;e Ebullitions, which was the Ca&s;e of many Adults, were not cured without very plentiful Sweats towards the Termination of the Di&s;ea&s;e; tho&s;e which occurred at the Inva&s;ion of it being certainly unprofitable, and always hurt|ful.</P>
<P>14. I have &s;een &s;ome Patients, in whom the Complaint of the Threat di&s;appeared entirely, without either Eruption or Sweats: but &s;uch &s;till remained in very great Inquietude and Angui&s;h, with a quick and &s;mall Pul&s;e. I ordered them a &s;udorific Drink, which being &s;ucceeded by the Eruption, or by Sweating, they found them&s;elves &s;en&s;ibly relieved.</P>
<P>15. But whether the Sick had, or had not, the&s;e external Redne&s;&s;es or Eruptions, every one of them parted with their Cuticle or Scarf Skin, which fell off, in large Scales, from the
<PB N="67" REF="012243_0087_0F8A6B73D0F0DE48">
whole Surface of the Body: &s;o great was the Acrimony or Sharp|ne&s;s of that Matter, which was to be di&s;charged through the Skin.</P>
<P>16. A great Number &s;uffered a &s;ingular Alteration in their Voice, different from that which occurs in common Quin&s;eys, the In&s;ides of their No&s;trils being extremely dry.</P>
<P>17. The Sick recovered with more Difficulty after this, than after the common Quin&s;eys: and if they were negligent or irre|gular, during their Recovery; particularly if they expo&s;ed them|&s;elves too &s;oon to the Cold, a Relap&s;e en&s;ued, or &s;ome different Symptoms; &s;uch as a Stuffing with Oppre&s;&s;ion, a Swelling of the Belly, windy Swellings in different Parts; Weakne&s;s, Loathings, Ulcerations behind the Ears, and &s;omething of a Cough and Hoar&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>18. I have been &s;ent for to Children, and al&s;o to &s;ome young Folks, who, at the End of &s;everal Weeks, had been taken with a general Inflammation of the whole Body, attended with great Oppre&s;&s;ion, and a con&s;iderable Abatement of their Urine, which was al&s;o high-coloured and turbid, or without Separation. They &s;eemed al&s;o in a very &s;ingular State of Indifference, or Di&s;regard, with re&s;pect to any Object or Circum&s;tance. I recovered every one of them entirely by Bli&s;ters, and the Powder No. 25. The fir&s;t Operation of this Medicine was to vomit them: to this &s;uc|ceeded a Di&s;charge by Urine, and at la&s;t very plentiful Sweating, which compleated the Cure. Two Patients only, of a bad Con|&s;titution, who were a little ricketty, and di&s;po&s;ed to glandular Scirrho&s;ity or Knottine&s;s, relap&s;ed and died, after being recovered of the Di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf for &s;ome Days.</P>
<P>&sect; 118. I have bled &s;ome adult Per&s;ons, and made U&s;e of the cooling Regimen, as long as there was an evident Inflammation: it was nece&s;&s;ary after this to unload the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages; and at la&s;t to excite moderate Sweats. The &s;ame Powders No. 25 have of|ten effected both the&s;e Di&s;charges, and with entire Succe&s;s. In other Ca&s;es I have made u&s;e of Ipecacuanha, as directed No. 35.</P>
<P>In &s;ome Subjects there did not appear any inflammatory Symp|tom; and the Di&s;temper was &s;olely owing to a Load of putrid Matter in the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages. Some Patients al&s;o di&s;charged Worms. In &s;uch Ca&s;es I never bled; but the Vomit had an ex|cellent Effect, at the very On&s;et of the Di&s;ea&s;e; it produced a perceivable Abatement of all the Symptoms; Sweating en&s;ued very kindly and naturally, and the Patient recovered entirely a few Hours after.</P>
<P>&sect; 119. There were &s;ome Places, where no Symptom or Cha|racter of Inflammation appeared; and in which Ca&s;es it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to omit Bleeding, that having been attended with bad Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>I never directed Infants to be bled. After opening the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages, Bli&s;ters and diluting Drinks proved their only Reme|dies.

A &s;imple Infu&s;ion of Elder-flowers, and tho&s;e of the Lime Tree, has done great Service to tho&s;e who drank plentifully of it.</P>
<P>&sect; 120. I am &s;en&s;ible that in many Villages a great Number of Per&s;ons have died, with a prodigious Inflation or Swelling of the Neck. Some have al&s;o died in the City, and among others a young Woman of twenty Years of Age, who had taken nothing but hot &s;weating Medicines and red Wine, and died the fourth Day, with violent Suffocations, and a large Di&s;charge of Blood from the No&s;e. Of the great Number I have &s;een in Per&s;on, only two died. One was a little Girl of ten Months old. She had an Efflore&s;cence which very &s;uddenly di&s;appeared: at this time I was called in; but the Humour had retreated to the Brea&s;t, and ren|dered her Death inevitable. The other was a &s;trong Youth from &s;ixteen to &s;eventeen Years old, who&s;e &s;udden Attack of the Di&s;ea&s;e manife&s;ted, from the very Beginning, a violent Degree of it. Neverthele&s;s, the Symptoms &s;ub&s;iding, and the Fever near|ly terminating, the Sweats which approached would probably have &s;aved him: but he would not &s;uffer them to have their Cour&s;e, continually &s;tripping him&s;elf quite naked. The Inflam|mation was immediately repelled upon the Lungs, and de&s;troyed him within the Space of thirty Hours. I never &s;aw a Per&s;on die with &s;o very dry a Skin. The Vomit affected him very little up|wards, and brought on a Purging. His own bad Conduct &s;eems to have been the Occa&s;ion of his Death; and may this &s;erve as one Example of it!</P>
<P>&sect; 121. I cho&s;e to expatiate on this Di&s;ea&s;e, as it may happen to reach other Places, where it may be u&s;eful to have been ap|prized of its Marks, and of its Treatment, which agrees as much with that of putrid Fevers, of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter, as with that of the inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;es I have already con&s;idered; &s;ince in &s;ome Subjects the Complaint of the Throat has evidently been a Symptom of a putrid Fever, rather than of the chiefly ap|parent Di&s;ea&s;e, a Quin&s;ey. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">I re&s;erve &s;ome other intere&s;ting Reflections on this Di&s;ea&s;e, for the &s;e|cond Edition of my Treati&s;e on Fevers; and the Editor at <HI>Paris</HI> has very well ob&s;erved, that it has &s;ome Relation to the gangrenous &s;ore Throat, which has been epidemical the&s;e twenty Years pa&s;t, in many Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI>&mdash;This Note is from Dr. TISSOT him&s;elf.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII. Of Colds.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 123. THERE are many erroneous Prejudices, with regard to Colds, all of which may be attended with pernicious Con|&s;equences. The fir&s;t is, that a Cold is never dangerous; an Er|ror which daily de&s;troys the Lives of many. I have already com|plained of it for many Years pa&s;t; and I have &s;ince beheld a Mul|titude of &s;uch Examples of it, as have but too &s;ufficiently war|ranted my Complaints.</P>
<P>No Per&s;on however, it is certain, dies merely of a Cold, as long as it is nothing but a Cold &s;imply; but when, from Inatten|tion and Neglect, it is thrown upon, and occa&s;ions Di&s;tempers of the Brea&s;t, it may, and often does, prove mortal. <HI>Colds de&s;troy more than Plagues,</HI> was the An&s;wer of a very &s;agacious and expe|rienced Phy&s;ician to one of his Friends, who, being a&s;ked, how he was in Health, replied, Very well, I have nothing but a Cold.</P>
<P>A &s;econd erroneous Prejudice is, that Colds require no Means, no Medicines, and that they la&s;t the longer for being nur&s;ed or tampered with. The la&s;t Article may be true indeed with re&s;pect to the Method, in which the Per&s;on affected with them, treats them, but the Principle it&s;elf is fal&s;e. Colds, like other Di&s;or|ders, have their proper Remedies; and are removed with more or le&s;s Facility, as they are conducted better or wor&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; 124. A third Mi&s;take is, that they are not only con&s;idered as not dangerous, but are even &s;uppo&s;ed whole&s;ome too. Doubt|le&s;s a Man had better have a Cold than a more grievous Di&s;ea&s;e; though it mu&s;t be &s;till better to have neither of them. The mo&s;t that can rea&s;onably be &s;aid and admitted on this Point, is, that when a checked, or an ob&s;tructed Per&s;piration becomes the Cau&s;e of a Di&s;temper, it is fortunate that it produces rather a Cold, than any very dreadful Di&s;ea&s;e, which it frequently does: though it were to be wi&s;hed, that neither the Cau&s;e, nor its Effect exi&s;ted. A Cold con&s;tantly produces &s;ome Di&s;order or Defect in the Func|tions of &s;ome Part or Parts of the Body, and thus becomes the Cau&s;e of a Di&s;ea&s;e. It is indeed a real Di&s;order it&s;elf, and which, when in a violent Degree, makes a very perceivable A&s;&s;ault upon our whole Machine. Colds, with their Defluctions, con&s;iderably weaken the Brea&s;t, and &s;ooner or later con&s;iderably impair the Health. Per&s;ons &s;ubject to frequent Colds are never robu&s;t or &s;trong; they often &s;ink into languid Di&s;orders; and a frequent Aptitude to take Cold is a Proof, that their Per&s;piration may be ea&s;ily checked and re&s;trained; whence the Lungs become op|pre&s;&s;ed

pre&s;&s;ed and ob&s;tructed, which mu&s;t always be attended with con|&s;iderable Danger.</P>
<P>&sect; 125. We may be convinced of the Weakne&s;s and Fallacy of the&s;e Prejudices, by con&s;idering attentively the Nature of Colds; which are nothing el&s;e than the very Di&s;ea&s;es already de&s;cribed in the three preceding Chapters, though in the lighte&s;t Degree only of &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>A Cold in truth is almo&s;t con&s;tantly an inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;e; a light Inflammation of the Lungs, or of the Throat; of the Membrane or very thin Skin, which lines the No&s;trils, and the In&s;ide of certain Cavities in the Bones of the Checks and Fore|head. The&s;e Cavities communicate with the No&s;e in &s;uch a Man|ner, that when one Part of this Membrane is affected with an In|flammation, it is ea&s;ily communicated to the other Parts.</P>
<P>&sect; 126. It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe the Symptoms of a Cold, and it may be &s;ufficient to remark, 1, That their chief Cau&s;e is the &s;ame with that, which mo&s;t commonly produces the Di&s;ea&s;es already treated of, that is, an ob&s;tructed Per&s;piration, and a Blood &s;omewhat inflamed. 2, That whenever the&s;e Di&s;|ea&s;es affect great Numbers, many Colds prevail at the &s;ame time. 3, That the Symptoms which manife&s;t a violent Cold, greatly re|&s;emble tho&s;e which precede or u&s;her in the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es. People are rarely attacked by great Colds, without a Shivering and Fever; which la&s;t &s;ometimes continues for many Days. There is a Cough, a dry Cough, for &s;ome time; after which &s;ome Expectoration en|&s;ues, which allays the Cough, and lightens the Oppre&s;&s;ion: at which time the Cold may be &s;aid to be maturated, or ripe. There are pretty often flight Stitches, but unfixed or flying about, with a little Complaint of the Throat. When the No&s;trils happen to be the Seat of the Di&s;order, which is then very improperly termed a Cold of the Brain, it is often attended with a vehement Head-ach, that &s;ometimes depends on an Irritation of the Membrane, which lines the Cavities in the Bone of the Forehead, or the max|illary Sinu&s;es, that is, the Cavities in the Jaws. At fir&s;t the run|ing from the No&s;e is very clear, thin and &s;harp; afterwards, in Proportion to the Abatement of the Inflammation, it becomes thicker; and the Con&s;i&s;tence and Colour of it re&s;emble tho&s;e of what others cough up. The Smell, the Ta&s;t, and the Appetite are commonly impaired by it.</P>
<P>&sect; 127. Colds &s;eem to be of no certain Duration or Continu|ance. Tho&s;e of the Head or Brain generally la&s;t but a few Days; of the Brea&s;t longer. Some Colds neverthele&s;s terminate in four or five Days. If they extend beyond this Term they prove really hurtful. 1, Becau&s;e the Violence of the Cough di&s;orders the whole Machine; and particularly, by forcing up the Blood to the Head. 2, By depriving the Per&s;on afflicted of his u&s;ual Sleep, which is almo&s;t con&s;tantly dimini&s;hed by it. 3, By im|pairing the Appetite, and confu&s;ing the Dige&s;tion, which is un|avoidably le&s;&s;ened by it. 4, By weakening the Lungs them&s;elves
<PB N="71" REF="012243_0091_0F8A6B76D1ECE9B8">
through the continual Agitation from Coughing; whence all the Humours being gradually determined towards them, as the weak e&s;t Part, a continual Cough &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. Hence al&s;o they become o|vercharged with Humours, which grow vi&s;cid there; the Re&s;pi|ration is overloaded and oppre&s;&s;ed; a flow Fever appears; Nu|trition almo&s;t cea&s;es; the Patient becomes very weak; &s;inks into a Wa&s;ting, an ob&s;tinate Wakefulne&s;s and Angui&s;h, and often dies in a &s;hort time, 5, By Rea&s;on that the Fever, which almo&s;t con|&s;tantly accompanies a great Cold, concurs to wear the Body down.</P>
<P>&sect; 128. Wherefore, &s;ince a Cold is a Di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;ame Kind with Quin&s;eys, Peripneumonies and Inflammations of the Brea&s;t, it ought to be treated in the &s;ame Manner. If it is a violent one, Blood &s;hould be taken from the Arm, which may con&s;iderably &s;horten its Duration: and this becomes more e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, whenever the Patient is of a &s;anguineous ruddy Complexion, a bounds with Blood, and has a &s;trong Cough, and great Head-ach.</P>
<P>The Drinks No. 1, 2, 3, 4, &s;hould be very plentifully u&s;ed. It is advantageous to bathe the Feet in warm Water every Night at going to Bed. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">It frequently happens, that the Bathings alone remove the Head-ach, and the Cough too, by relaxing the lower Parts, and the entire Surface of the Body. If the Patient is co&s;tive, he &s;hould receive Gly&s;ters of warm Water, in which &s;ome Bran has been boiled, with the Addition of a little common Soap or Butter. <HI>E. L.</HI></NOTE> In a Word, if the Patient is put into a Re|gimen, the Cure is very &s;peedily effected.</P>
<P>&sect; 129. The Di&s;order, indeed, however, is often &s;o very &s;light, that it may be thought to require very little, if any medical Treatment, and may be ea&s;ily cured without Phy&s;ick, by ab&s;tain|ing from Fle&s;h, Eggs, Broth and Wine; from all Food that is &s;harp, fat and heavy; and by dieting upon Bread, Puls, Fruit and Water; particularly by eating little or no Supper; and drink|ing, if thir&s;ty, a &s;imple Pti&s;an of Barley, or an Infu&s;ion of Elder flowers, with the Addition of a third or fourth Part of Milk. Bathing the Feet, and the Powder No. 20 contribute to di&s;po&s;e the Patient to &s;leep. Five Tea-Cups of an Infu&s;ion of the red, or wild Poppy Leaves may al&s;o be ventured on &s;afely.</P>
<P>&sect; 130. When the Fever, Heat and Inflammation wholly di&s;ap|pear; when the Patient has kept to his Regimen for &s;ome Days, and his Blood is well diluted, if the Cough and Want of Sleep &s;till continue, he may take in the Evening a Do&s;e of Storax <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Under the&s;e Circum&s;tances of a tickling Cough from a Cold, without a Fe|ver, and with very little Inflammation, I have known great and very frequent Succe&s;s from a Do&s;e of <HI>Elixir paregoricum,</HI> taken at Bed-time, after a very light thin Supper. If the Patient be &s;anguine, &s;trong and co&s;tive, Bleeding in a &s;uit|able Quantity, and a gently opening Potion, or purging Gly&s;ter, may be pru|dently premi&s;ed to it.

or of Venice Treacle with Elder-flower Tea, after bathing his Feet. The&s;e Remedies by &s;tilling the Cough, and re&s;toring Per|&s;piration, frequently cure the Cold in the Space of one Night. I confe&s;s at the &s;ame time, I have &s;een bad Con&s;equences from &s;uch Opiates, when given too early in the Complaint. It is al&s;o nece&s;|&s;ary, when they are given, that the Patient &s;hould have &s;upt but very moderately, and that his Supper &s;hould be dige&s;ted.</P>
<P>&sect; 131. An immen&s;e Number of Remedies are cried up for the Cure of Colds, &s;uch as Pti&s;ans of Apples or Pippins, of Liquorice, of dry Rai&s;ins, of Figs, of Borage, of Ground-Ivy, of <HI>Veronica,</HI> or Speedwell, of Hy&s;op, of Nettles, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> I have no De&s;ign to depreciate them; as all of them may po&s;&s;ibly be u&s;eful: But unfortunately, tho&s;e who have &s;een any particular one of them &s;ucceed in one Ca&s;e, readily conclude it to be the mo&s;t excellent of them all; which is a dangerous Error, becau&s;e no one Ca&s;e is a &s;ufficient Foundation to decide upon: neither indeed are any qua|lified to decide, who have not &s;een a great Number of &s;uch Ca&s;es; and who do not &s;o attentively ob&s;erve the Effects of different Me|dicines, as to determine on tho&s;e which mo&s;t frequently agree with the Di&s;order; and which, in my Judgment, are tho&s;e I have ju&s;t enumerated. I have known a Tea or Infu&s;ion of Cherry Stalks, which is not a di&s;agreeable Drink, to cure a very invete|rate Cold.</P>
<P>&sect; 132. In Colds of the Head or Brain, the Steam of warm Wa|ter alone, or that in which Elder-flowers, or &s;ome other mild a|romatic Herbs, have been boiled, commonly affords a pretty &s;peedy Relief. The&s;e are al&s;o &s;erviceable in Colds fallen on the Brea&s;t. See &sect; 55.</P>
<P>It has been a Practice, though of no very long &s;tanding, to give the Fat of a Whale in the&s;e Ca&s;es; but this is a very crude indige&s;tible Kind of Fat, and grea&s;y oily Medicines &s;eldom agree with Colds. Be&s;ides, this Whale's Fat is very di&s;agreeable and rancid, that is rank; &s;o that it were better to forbear u&s;ing it: I have &s;ometimes &s;een ill Effects from it, and rarely any good ones <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">This &s;eems but too applicable to the very popular U&s;e of <HI>Spermaecti,</HI> &amp;c. in &s;uch Ca&s;es, which can only grea&s;e the Pa&s;&s;age to the Stomach; mu&s;t impair its dige&s;tive Faculty, and cannot operate again&s;t the Cau&s;e of a Cold; tho' that Cure of it, which is effected by the Oeconomy of Nature in due time, is often a&s;cribed to &s;uch Medicines, as may rather have retarded it. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; 133. Such Per&s;ons as abate nothing of the u&s;ual Quantity of their Food, when &s;eized with a Cold, and who &s;wallow down large Quantities of hot Water, ruin their Health. Their Dige&s;|tion cea&s;es; the Cough begins to affect the Stomach, without cea&s;ing to afflict the Brea&s;t; and they incur a Chance of &s;inking into the Condition de&s;cribed &sect; 127, No. 4.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="012243_0093_0F8A6B784CB43A50">Burnt Brandy and &s;piced Wine are very pernicious in the Be|ginning of Colds, and the Omi&s;&s;ion of them mu&s;t be a very pru|dent Omi&s;&s;ion. If any good Effects have ever been known to at|tend the U&s;e of them, it has been towards the going off of the Cold; when the Di&s;order maintained its Ground, &s;olely from the Weakne&s;s of the Patient. Whenever this is the Ca&s;e, there is not the lea&s;t Room for farther Relaxation; but the Powders No. 14, &s;hould be taken every Day in a little Wine; and &s;hould the Hu|mours &s;eem likely to be thrown upon the Lungs, Bli&s;ters ought to be applied to the fle&s;hy Part of the Legs.</P>
<P>&sect; 134. Drams, or <HI>Liqueurs,</HI> as they are called in <HI>French,</HI> agree &s;o very little in this la&s;t State, that frequently a very &s;mall Quan|tity of them revives a Cold that was ju&s;t expiring. There really are &s;ome Per&s;ons who never drink them without taking Cold, which is not to be wondered at, as they occa&s;ion a light Inflam|mation in the Brea&s;t, which is equivalent to a Cold or Defluc|tion.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons labouring under this Di&s;order &s;hould not, however, expo&s;e them&s;elves to violent cold Weather, if there is a Po&s;&s;ibility of avoiding it: though they &s;hould equally guard too again&s;t ex|ce&s;&s;ive Heat. Tho&s;e, who inclo&s;e them&s;elves in very hot Rooms, never get quite cured; and how is it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be cured in &s;uch a Situation? Such Rooms; ab&s;tracted from the Danger of coming out of them, produce Colds in the &s;ame Manner that Drams do, by producing a light Inflammation in the Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect; 135. Per&s;ons &s;ubject to frequent Colds, which Habits are &s;ometimes termed <HI>fluxionary,</HI> or liable to Defluxions, imagine they ought to keep them&s;elves very hot. This is an Error which tho|roughly de&s;troys their Health. Such a Di&s;po&s;ition to take Cold ari&s;es from two Cau&s;es; either becau&s;e their Per&s;piration is ea&s;ily impaired; or &s;ometimes from the Weakne&s;s of the Stomach or the Lungs, which require particular Remedies. When the Com|plaint ari&s;es from the Per&s;piration's being ea&s;ily di&s;turbed and le&s;&s;ened, the hotter they keep them&s;elves, the more they &s;weat, and increa&s;e their Complaint the more. This ince&s;&s;antly warm Air lets down and weakens the whole Machine, and more particu|larly the Lungs; where the Humours finding le&s;s Re&s;i&s;tance, are continually derived, and are accumulated there. The Skin be|ing con&s;tantly bathed in a &s;mall Sweat, becomes relaxed, &s;oft, and incapable of compleating its Functions: from which Failure the &s;lighte&s;t Cau&s;e produces a total Ob&s;truction of Per&s;piration; and a Multitude of languid Di&s;orders en&s;ue.</P>
<P>The&s;e Patients, thus circum&s;tanced, redouble their Precautions again&s;t the Cold, or even the Coolne&s;s of the Air, while their utmo&s;t Cautions are but &s;o many effectual Means to lower their Health; and this the more certainly, as their Dread of the free Air nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubjects them to a fedentary Life, which increa&s;es all their Symptoms; while the hot Drinks they indulge in com|pleat their Severity. There is but one Method to cure People
<PB N="74" REF="012243_0094_0F8A6B792D8D6468">
thus &s;ituated; that is, by accu&s;toming them gradually to the Air; to keep them out of hot Chambers; to le&s;&s;en their Cloathing by Degrees; to make them &s;leep cool; and let them eat or drink nothing but what is cold, Ice it&s;elf being whole&s;ome in their Drink: to make them u&s;e much Exerci&s;e; and finally, if the Di&s;order be inveterate, to give them for a con&s;iderable time the Powder No. 14, and make them u&s;e the cold Bath. This Method &s;ucceeds equally too with tho&s;e, in whom the Di&s;ea&s;e originally depended on a Weakne&s;s of the Stomach, or of the Lungs: and in fact, at the End of a certain Period, the&s;e three Cau&s;es are al|ways combined. Some Per&s;ons who have been &s;ubject, for many Years, to catch Colds throughout the Winter; and who, during that Sea&s;on, never went out, and drank every thing warm, have been evidently the better, during the Winters of 1761 and 1762, for the Directions I have given here. They now walk out every Day; drink their Liquids cold; and by this Means entirely e&s;|cape Colds, and enjoy perfect Health.</P>
<P>&sect; 236. It is more cu&s;tomary indeed in Town, than in the Country, to have different Sorts of Troches, and Compo&s;itions in the Mouth. I am not for excluding this Habit; though I think nothing is &s;o efficacious as Juice of Liquorice; and provi|ded a &s;ufficient Do&s;e be given, it affords certain Relief. I have taken an Ounce and a half in one Day, and have felt the good Con&s;equences of it very remarkably.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VIII. Of the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Teeth.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 137. THE Di&s;ea&s;es of the Teeth, which are &s;ometimes &s;o tedious and &s;o violent, as to cau&s;e ob&s;tinate Wakefulne&s;s, a con&s;i|derable Degree of Fever, Raving, Inflammations, Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, Rot|tenne&s;s of the Bones, Convul&s;ions, and Faintings, depend on three principal Cau&s;es. 1, On a <HI>Caries</HI> or Rottenne&s;s of the Teeth. 2, On an Inflammation of the Nerves of the Teeth, or of the Membrane which inve&s;ts and covers them; and which affects the Membrane of the Gums. 3, On a cold Humour or Defluction that is determined to the Teeth, and to their Nerves and Mem|brane.</P>
<P>&sect; 138. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e Ca&s;es, the <HI>Caries</HI> having eat down to, and expo&s;ed the naked Nerve, the Air, Food, and Drink ir|ritate, or, as it were, &s;ting it; and this Irritation is attended with Pain more or le&s;s violent. Every thing that increa&s;es the
<PB N="75" REF="012243_0095_0F8A6B79FA10B348">
Motion or Action of the affected Part, as Exerci&s;e, Heat, or Food, will be attended with the &s;ame Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>When the Tooth is greatly decayed, there is no other Cure be|&s;ides that by extracting it, without which the Pain continues; the Breath becomes very offen&s;ive; the Gum is eat down; the o|ther Teeth, and &s;ometimes even the Jaw-bone, are infected with the Rottenne&s;s: be&s;ides, that it al&s;o prevents the U&s;e of the other Teeth, which are infe&s;ted with a Kind of tartarous Matter, and Decay.</P>
<P>But when the Di&s;order is le&s;s con&s;iderable, the Progre&s;s of it may &s;ometimes be re&s;trained, by burning the Tooth with a hot I|ron, or by filling it with Lead, if it is fitted to receive and to re|tain it. Different corroding Liquids are &s;ometimes u&s;ed on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, <HI>Aqua Fortis</HI> it&s;elf, and Spirit of Vitriol: but &s;uch Ap|plications are highly dangerous, and ought to be excluded. When the Patients, from Dread, reject the Operations ju&s;t mentioned, a little Oil of Cloves may be applied, by introducing a &s;mall Pel|let of Cotton, dipt in it, to the rotten hollow Tooth; which of|ten affords con&s;iderable Ea&s;e and Re&s;pite. Some make u&s;e of a Tincture of Opium, or Laudanum, after the &s;ame Manner; and indeed the&s;e two Medicines may be u&s;ed together in equal Quanti|ties. I have often &s;ucceeded with <HI>Hoffman</HI>'s mineral Anodyne Liquor; which &s;eemed indeed for a few Moments, to increa&s;e the Pain; but Ea&s;e generally en&s;ues after &s;pitting a little time. A Gargari&s;m made of the Herb <HI>Argentina,</HI> that is Silver-weed, or wild Tan&s;ey, in Water, frequently appea&s;es the Pain that re&s;ults from a <HI>Caries</HI> of the Teeth: and in &s;uch Ca&s;es many People have found them&s;elves at Ea&s;e, under a con&s;tant U&s;e of it. It certain|ly is an Application that cannot hurt, and is even beneficial to the Gums. Others have been relieved by rubbing their Faces over with Honey.</P>
<P>&sect; 139. The &s;econd Cau&s;e is the Inflammation of the Nerve with|in the Sub&s;tance, or of the Membrane on the Out&s;ide of the Tooth. This is di&s;covered by the Patient's Temperament Age and Man|ner of living. They who are young, &s;anguine, who heat them|&s;elves much, whether by Labour, by their Food, their Drink, by &s;itting up late, or by any other Exce&s;s; they who have been accu&s;tomed to any Di&s;charges or Eruptions of Blood, whether na|tural or artificial, and who cea&s;e to have them as u&s;ual, are much expo&s;ed to the Tooth-ach, from this Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This Pain, or rather Torment, if in an acute Degree, com|monly happens very &s;uddenly, and often after &s;ome heating Cau&s;e. The Pul&s;e is &s;trong and full; the Countenance con&s;iderably red; the Mouth extremely hot: there is often a pretty high Fever, and a violent Head-ach. The Gums, or &s;ome Part of them, become inflamed, &s;welled, and &s;ometimes an Ab&s;ce&s;s appears. At other times the Humours throw them&s;elves upon the more external Parts; the Cheek &s;wells, and the Pain abates. When the Cheek
<PB N="76" REF="012243_0096_0F8A6ADEE2AA8AD0">
&s;wells, but without any Diminution of the Pain, it then becomes an Augmentation, but no e&s;&s;ential Change, of the Di&s;order.</P>
<P>&sect; 140. In this Species of the Di&s;ea&s;e, we mu&s;t have Recour&s;e to the general Method of treating inflammatory Di&s;orders, and direct Bleeding, which often produces immediate Ea&s;e, if per|formed early. After Bleeding, the Patient &s;hould gargle with Barley Water, or Milk and Water; and apply an emollient Cata|pla&s;m to the Cheek. If an Ab&s;ce&s;s or little Impo&s;thume appears, the Suppuration or ripening of it is to be promoted, by holding continually in the Mouth &s;ome hot Milk, or Figs boiled in &s;ome Milk: and as &s;oon as ever it &s;eems ripe, it &s;hould be opened, which may be done ea&s;ily, and without any Pain. The Di&s;order, when depending on this Cau&s;e, is &s;ometimes not &s;o violent, but of a longer Duration and returns whenever the Patient heats him|&s;elf; when he goes to Bed; or as &s;oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s he takes any heating Food, or Drink, Wine. or Coffee. In this Ca&s;e he &s;hould be bled, without which his other Medicines will have little Effect; and he &s;hould bath his Feet in warm Water for &s;ome Evenings &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, taking one Do&s;e of the Powder No. 20. Entire Ab|&s;tinence from Wine and Meat; e&s;pecially at Night, has cured &s;e|veral Per&s;ons of inveterate and ob&s;tinate Maladies of the Teeth.</P>
<P>In this Species of Tooth-ach, all hot Remedies are pernicious; and it often happens that Opium, Venice Treacle, and Storax Pills, are &s;o far from producing the Relief expected from them, that they have aggravated the Pain.</P>
<P>&sect; 141. When the Di&s;ea&s;e ari&s;es from a cold Di&s;tillation, or Humour, tending to the&s;e Parts, it is commonly (though equal|ly painful) attended with le&s;s violent Symptoms. The Pul&s;e is neither &s;trong, full nor quick; the Mouth is le&s;s heated and le&s;s &s;welled. In &s;uch Ca&s;es the afflicted &s;hould be purged with the Powder No. 21, which has &s;ometimes perfectly cured very ob&s;ti|nate Complaints of this Sort. After purging they &s;hould make u&s;e of the Diet Drink of the Woods No. 22. This has cured Tooth achs, which have baffled other Attempts for many Years; but it mu&s;t be added, this Drink would be hurtful in the Di&s;ea&s;e from a different Cau&s;e. Bli&s;ters to the Nape of the Neck, or <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;mall Bli&s;ter behind the Ear of the affected Side, or both Ears, has very often removed the Pain, when from a Defluction. It is not uncommon for the Subjects of this Di&s;ea&s;e to be very co&s;tive, during the Exacerbations of it, which I have &s;ometimes experienced to be pretty regularly and &s;everely quotidian, for a Week or two. The Cu&s;tom of &s;moking Tobacco very often, which the Vehe|mence of this Pain has &s;ometimes introduced, often di&s;po&s;es to a Blackne&s;s, and premature Decay of the Teeth, to which the Chewers of it &s;eem le&s;s obnoxious: and this Difference may re&s;ult from &s;ome Particles of its chemical Oil ri&s;ing by Fumigation, and being retained in the Teeth, which Particles are not extracted by Ma&s;tication. But with regard to the habitual U&s;e of this very acrid and internal|ly violent Herb, for, but chiefly after, this Di&s;ea&s;e, it &s;hould be con&s;idered well, whether in &s;ome Con&s;titutions it may not pave the Way to a more dange|rous one, than that it was introduced to remove. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> el&s;ewhere, it matters not greatly where, have often extraordinary good Effects, by diverting the Humour and re&s;toring a compleat Per&s;piration.

As this la&s;t Cau&s;e is often the Con&s;equence of a Weak|ne&s;s in the Stomach, it daily happens that we &s;ee &s;ome People, who&s;e Di&s;order from this Cau&s;e is augmented, in Proportion as they indulge in a cooling, refre&s;hing Way of living. The In|crea&s;e of the Di&s;order di&s;po&s;es them to increa&s;e the Do&s;e of what they mi&s;take for its Remedy, in Proportion to which their Pain only increa&s;es. There is a Nece&s;&s;ity that &s;uch Per&s;ons &s;hould alter this Method; and make u&s;e of tho&s;e Medicines which are proper to &s;trengthen the Stomach, and to re&s;tore Per&s;piration. The Pow|der No. 14 has often produced the be&s;t Con&s;equences, when I have ordered it in the&s;e Ca&s;es; and it never fails to di&s;&s;ipate that Tooth-ach very &s;peedily, which returns periodically at &s;tated Days and Hours.

When it is of a &s;corbutic Nature, the wild Hor&s;e-radi&s;h (Pepper|wort) Water Cre&s;&s;es, Brooklime, Sorrel, and Wood-&s;orrel cor|rect and cure it. If it is of a different Nature, it requires different Remedies. But very particular Details do not come within the Plan of this Work. As the Malady is of the chronical or tedious Kind, it allows time to con&s;ider and con&s;ult more particularly a|bout it.</P>
<P>The Gout and the Rheumati&s;m are &s;ometimes transferred to the Teeth, and give Ri&s;e to the mo&s;t excruciating Pains; which mu&s;t be treated like the Di&s;ea&s;es from which they ari&s;e.</P>

Now the plain Rea&s;on of this is, that the&s;e Applications are always di|rected,
<PB N="78" REF="012243_0098_0F8A6AE01A104590">
without an exact Knowledge of the particular Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, in different Subjects and Circum&s;tances; whence the Pain from a rotten Tooth is treated like that from an Inflamma|tion; that from an Inflammation, like the Pain from a cold Hu|mour or Fluxion; and this la&s;t like a Pain cau&s;ed by a &s;corbutic Acrimony: &s;o that the Di&s;appointment is not in the lea&s;t &s;ur|prizing. Perhaps Phy&s;icians them&s;elves do not always attend di&s;|tinctly enough to the Nature of each particular Di&s;order: and e|ven when they do, they content them&s;elves with directing &s;ome of the le&s;s potent Medicines, which may be inadequate to accompli&s;h the nece&s;&s;ary Effect. If the Di&s;temper truly be of an inflammatory Di&s;po&s;ition, Bleeding is indi&s;pen&s;ible to the Cure.</P>
<P>It happens in fact, with Regard to the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Teeth, as well as to all other Di&s;ea&s;es, that they ari&s;e from different Cau&s;es; and if the&s;e Cau&s;es are not oppo&s;ed by Medicines &s;uited to them, the Di&s;ea&s;e, far from being cured, is aggravated.</P>
<P>I have cured violent Tooth-achs, of the lower Jaw, by apply|ing a Plai&s;ter of Meal, the White of an Egg, Brandy, and Ma&s;|tich, at the Corner of that Jaw, over the Spot where the Pul&s;a|tion of the Artery may be perceived: and I have al&s;o mitigated the mo&s;t excruciating Pains of the Head, by applying the &s;ame Plai&s;ter upon the temporal Artery.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER IX. Of the Apoplexy.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 145. EVERY Per&s;on has &s;ome Idea of the Di&s;ea&s;e termed an Apo|plexy, which is a &s;udden Privation or Lo&s;s of all Sen&s;e, and of all voluntary Motion; the Pul&s;e at the &s;ame time being kept up, but Re&s;piration or Breathing being oppre&s;&s;ed. I &s;hall treat of this Di&s;ea&s;e only in a brief Manner, as it is not common in our Country Villages; and as I have expatiated on it in a different Manner in a Letter to Dr. HALLER, publi&s;hed in 1761.</P>
<P>&sect; 146. This Di&s;ea&s;e is generally di&s;tingui&s;hed into two Kinds, the &s;anguineous and &s;erous Apoplexy. Each of them re&s;ults from an Overfulne&s;s of the Blood Ve&s;&s;els of the Brain, which pre&s;&s;es up|on, and prevents or impairs the Functions of the Nerves. The whole Difference between the&s;e two Species con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the &s;anguineous Apoplexy prevails among &s;trong robu&s;t Per&s;ons, who have a rich, heavy, thick, and inflammable Blood, and that in a large Quantity; in which Circum&s;tance it becomes a genuine inflammatory Di&s;temper. The &s;erous, or humoral Apoplexy in|vades Per&s;ons of a le&s;s robu&s;t Con&s;titution; who&s;e Blood is more
<PB N="79" REF="012243_0099_0F8A6AE0CFEDE950">
dilute or watery; and rather vi&s;cid, or lightly gelatinous, than heavy or rich; who&s;e Ve&s;&s;els are in a more relaxed State; and who abound more in other Humours than in red Blood.</P>
<P>&sect; 147. When the fir&s;t Kind of this Di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ts in its mo&s;t vi|olent Degree, it is then &s;ometimes termed, an apoplectic Stroke, or thundering Apoplexy, which kills in a Moment or in&s;tantane|ou&s;ly, and admits of no Remedies. When the A&s;&s;ault is le&s;s vi|olent, and we find the Patient with a &s;trong, full and rai&s;ed Pul&s;e, his Vi&s;age red and bloated, and his Neck &s;welled up; with an oppre&s;&s;ed and loud hoar&s;e Re&s;piration; being &s;en&s;ible of nothing, and capable of no other Motions, except &s;ome Efforts to vomit, the Ca&s;e is not always equally de&s;perate. We mu&s;t there|fore immediately,</P>
<P>1, Entirely uncover the Patient's Head, covering the re&s;t of his Body but very lightly; procure him in&s;tantly very fre&s;h free Air, and leave his Neck quite unbound and open.</P>
<P>2, His Head &s;hould be placed as high as may be, with his Feet hanging down.</P>
<P>3, He mu&s;t lo&s;e from twelve to &s;ixteen Ounces of Blood, from a free open Orifice in the Arm; the Strength or Violence with which the Blood &s;allies out, &s;hould determine the Surgeon to take a few Ounces more or le&s;s. It &s;hould be repeated to the third or fourth time, within the Space of three or four Hours, if the Symp|toms &s;eem to require it, either in the Arm, or in the Foot.</P>
<P>4, A Gly&s;ter &s;hould be given of a Decoction of the fir&s;t emol|lient opening Herbs that can be got, with four Spoonfuls of Oil, and one Spoonful of Salt; which &s;hould be repeated every three Hours.</P>
<P>5, If it is po&s;&s;ible, he &s;hould be made to &s;wallow Water plenti|fully, in each Pot, or three Pounds and a Quarter, of which three Drachms of Nitre are to be di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>6, As &s;oon as the Height and Violence of the Pul&s;e abates, when the Patient's Breathing becomes le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed and difficult, and his Countenance le&s;s inflamed, he &s;hould take the Decoction No. 23; or, if it cannot be got ready in time, he &s;hould take three Quarters of an Ounce of Cream of Tartar, and drink Whey plentifully after it. This Medicine &s;ucceeded extremely well with me in a Ca&s;e where I could not readily procure any other.</P>
<P>7, He &s;hould avoid all &s;trong Liquor, Wine, di&s;tilled Spirit, whether inwardly or by outward Application, and &s;hould even be prevented from <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have been very authentically a&s;&s;ured of the Death of a hale Man, which happened in the very act of pouring out a large Quantity of di&s;tilled Spirits, by Gallons or Bucket-fuls, from one Ve&s;&s;el into another. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> &s;melling them.</P>
<P>8, The Patient &s;hould be &s;tirred, moved, or even touched, as little as it is po&s;&s;ible: in a word, every thing mu&s;t be avoided that can give him the lea&s;t Agitation. This Advice, I am &s;en&s;i|ble,
<PB N="80" REF="012243_0100_0F8A6AE19384A4A0">
is directly contrary to the common Practice; notwith&s;tand|ing which it is founded in Rea&s;on, approved by Experience, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. In fact, the whole Evil re&s;ults from the Blood being driven up with too much Force, and in too great a Quantity, to the Brain; which being thence in a State of Com|pre&s;&s;ion, prevents every Movement and every Influence of the Nerves. In order, therefore, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the&s;e Movements, the Brain mu&s;t be unloaded, by dimini&s;hing the Force of the Blood. But &s;trong Liquors, Wines, Spirits, volatile Salts, all Agitations and Frictions augment it, and by that very Means in|crea&s;e the Load, the Embarra&s;&s;ment of the Brain, and thus heighten the Di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf. On the contrary, every thing that calms the Circulation, contributes to recall Sen&s;ation and volun|tary Motion the &s;ooner.</P>
<P>9. Strong Ligatures &s;hould be made about the Thighs under the Ham: By this Means the Blood is prevented in its A&s;cent from the Legs, and le&s;s is carried up to the Head.</P>
<P>If the Patient &s;eems gradually, and in Proportion as he takes proper Medicines, to advance into a le&s;s violent State, there may be &s;ome Hopes. But if he rather grows wor&s;e after his earlie&s;t Evacuations, the Ca&s;e is de&s;perate.</P>
<P>&sect; 148. When Nature and Art effect his Recovery, his Sen&s;es return: though there frequently remains a little <HI>Delirium</HI> or Wan|dering for &s;ome time; and almo&s;t always a paralytic Defect, more or le&s;s of the Tongue, the Arm, the Leg, and the Mu&s;cles of the &s;ame Side of the Face. This Pal&s;y &s;ometimes goes off gradually, by the Help of cooling Purges from time to time, and a Diet that is but very moderately and lightly nouri&s;hing. All hot Medicines are extremely hurtful in this Ca&s;e, and may pave the Way to a re|peated Attack. A Vomit might be even fatal, and has been more than once &s;o <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vomits, which are &s;o pernicious in the &s;anguineous Apoplexy, where the Patient's Countenance and Eyes are inflamed; and which are al&s;o dangerous or u&s;ele&s;s, when a Per&s;on has been very moderate in his Meals, or is weakened by Age or other Circum&s;tances, and who&s;e Stomach is far from being overloaded with Aliment, are neverthele&s;s very proper for gro&s;s Feeders, who are accu&s;tomed to exceed at Table, who have Indige&s;tions, and have a Ma&s;s of vi&s;cid glairy Hu|mours in their Stomachs; more e&s;pecially, if &s;uch a one has a little while before indulged him&s;elf exce&s;&s;ively, whence he has vomited without any other evident Cau&s;e, or at lea&s;t had very &s;trong <HI>Nau&s;eas,</HI> or Loathings.

or Ma&s;s in the Stomach; but on the Oppre&s;&s;ion and Embarra&s;&s;|ment of the Brain: and the more con&s;iderable &s;uch Efforts are, the more &s;uch Oppre&s;&s;ion is increa&s;ed; by rea&s;on that as long as they continue, the Blood cannot return from the Head, by which Means the Brain remains overcharged.</P>
<P>&sect; 149. The other Species of Apoplexy is attended with the like Symptoms, excepting the Pul&s;e not being &s;o high nor &s;trong; the Countenance being al&s;o le&s;s red, &s;ometimes even pale; the Breathing &s;eems le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed; and &s;ometimes the Sick have a greater Facility to vomit, and di&s;charge more upwards.</P>
<P>As this Kind of the Di&s;ea&s;e attacks Per&s;ons who abound le&s;s in Blood; who are le&s;s &s;trong, and le&s;s heated or inflamed, Bleeding is not often at all nece&s;&s;ary; at lea&s;t the Repetition of it is &s;carcely ever &s;o: and &s;hould the Pul&s;e have but a &s;mall Fullne&s;s, and not the lea&s;t unnatural Hardne&s;s, Bleeding might even be pernicious.</P>
<P>1. The Patient however &s;hould be placed as was directed in the former Mode of this Di&s;ea&s;e; though it &s;eems not equally nece&s;|&s;ary here.</P>
<P>2. He &s;hould receive a Gly&s;ter, but without Oil, with double the Quantity of Salt, and a Bit of Soap of the Size of a &s;mall Egg; or with four or five Sprigs of Hedge Hy&s;&s;op. It may be repeated twice a Day.</P>
<P>3. He &s;hould be purged with the Powder No. 21.</P>
<P>4. His common Drink may be a &s;trong Infu&s;ion of Leaves of Bawm.</P>
<P>5. The Purge &s;hould be repeated the third Day.</P>
<P>6. Bli&s;ters &s;hould immediately be applied to the fle&s;hy Part of the Legs, or between the Shoulder Blades. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The&s;e Bli&s;ters may be preceded by Cupping with Scarification on the Nape of the Neck. This Remedy, often u&s;ed by the ancient Phy&s;icians, hut too lit|tle practi&s;ed in <HI>France,</HI> is one of the mo&s;t &s;peedy, and not the lea&s;t efficacious, Applications in both &s;anguine and &s;erous Apoplexies. <HI>E. L.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>7. Should Nature &s;eem di&s;po&s;ed to relieve her&s;elf by Sweating, it &s;hould be encouraged; and I have often known an Infu&s;ion of the <HI>Carduus Benedictus,</HI> or ble&s;&s;ed Thi&s;tle, produce this Effect very &s;ucce&s;sfully. If this Method be entered upon, the Sweat ought to be kept up (without &s;tirring if po&s;&s;ible) for many Days. It has then &s;ometimes happened, that at the End of nine Days, the Pa|tient has been totally freed from the Pal&s;y, which commonly &s;uc|ceeds this Species of the Apoplexy, ju&s;t as it does the other.</P>
<P>&sect; 150. Per&s;ons who have been attacked with either Kinds of this Di&s;ea&s;e, are liable to &s;ub&s;equent ones; each of which is more dangerous than that preceding: whence an Endeavour to obvi|ate or prevent &s;uch Relap&s;es becomes of the utmo&s;t Importance. This is to be effected in each Sort by a very exact, and rather &s;evere Diet, even to dimini&s;hing the u&s;ual Quantity of the Patient's Food; the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Precaution, to be ob&s;erved by any who have been once a&s;&s;aulted with it, being entirely to leave off Sup|pers.
<PB N="82" REF="012243_0102_0F8A6AE421FB5358">
Indeed tho&s;e, who have been once attacked with the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the <HI>&s;anguineous Apoplexies,</HI> &s;hould be &s;till more exact, more upon their Guard, than the others. They &s;hould deny them&s;elves whatever is rich and juicy, hot or aromatic, &s;harp, Wine, di&s;til|led Liquors and Coffee. They &s;hould chiefly confine them&s;elves to Garden-Stuff, Fruits and Acids; &s;uch &s;hould eat but little Fle&s;h, and only tho&s;e called white; taking every Week two or three Do&s;es of the Powder No. 24, in a Morning fa&s;ting, in a Gla&s;s of Water. They &s;hould be purged twice or thrice a Year with the Draught No. 23; u&s;e daily Exerci&s;e; avoid very hot Rooms, and the violent Heat of the Sun. They &s;hould go to Bed betimes, ri&s;e early, never lie in Bed above eight Hours; and if it is ob&s;erved that their Blood increa&s;es con&s;iderably, and has a Ten|dency towards the Head, they &s;hould be bled without He&s;itation; and for &s;ome Days re&s;train them&s;elves entirely to a thin and low Regimen, without taking any &s;olid Food. In the&s;e Circum&s;tances warm Bathings are hurtful. In the other, the &s;erous Apoplexy, in&s;tead of purging with No. 23, the Patient &s;hould take the Purge No. 21.</P>
<P>&sect; 151. The &s;ame Means, that are proper to prevent a Relap&s;e, might al&s;o obviate or keep off a primary or fir&s;t A&s;&s;ault, if em|ployed in time; for notwith&s;tanding it may happen very &s;uddenly, yet this Di&s;ea&s;e fore&s;hews it&s;elf many Weeks, &s;ometimes many Months, nay even Years beforehand, by Vertigos, Heavine&s;s of the Head; &s;mall Defects of the Tongue or Speech; &s;hort and momentary Pal&s;ies, &s;ometimes of one, &s;ometimes of another Part; &s;ometimes by Loathings and Reachings to vomit; with|out &s;uppo&s;ing any Ob&s;truction or Load in the fir&s;t: Pa&s;&s;ages, or any other Cau&s;e in the Stomach, or the adjoining Parts.

<P>Some Per&s;ons are liable to certain Symptoms and Appearances, which ari&s;e from the &s;ame Cau&s;e as an Apoplexy; and which in|deed may be con&s;idered as very light mild Apoplexies, of which they &s;u&s;tain many Attacks, and yet without any con&s;iderable An|noyance of their Health. The Blood, all at once as it were, flu&s;hes up to their Heads; they appear heedle&s;s or blundering; and have &s;ometimes Di&s;gu&s;ts and <HI>Nau&s;eas,</HI> and yet without any Abatement of their Under&s;tanding, their Sen&s;es, or Motion of any Sort.

<HEAD>CHAPTER X. Of the violent Influence, or Strokes, of the Sun.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 152. THIS Appellation is applied to tho&s;e Di&s;orders, which ari&s;e from too violent an Influence of the Heat of the Sun, im|mediately upon the Head; and which, in one Word, may ba termed <HI>In&s;olation.</HI></P>
<P>If we con&s;ider that Wood, Stone, and Metals, when long ex|po&s;ed to the Sun, become very hot, and that even in temperate Climates, to &s;uch a Degree, that they can &s;carcely be touched without &s;ome Sen&s;ation of burning, we may ea&s;ily conceive the Ri&s;k a Per&s;on undergoes, in having his Head expo&s;ed to the &s;ame Degree of Heat. The Blood-Ve&s;&s;els grow dry, the Blood it&s;elf becomes conden&s;ed or thickened, and a real Inflammation is formed, which has proved mortal in a very little time. It was this Di&s;temper, a Stroke of the Sun, which killed <HI>Mana&s;&s;es,</HI> the Hu&s;band of <HI>Judith.</HI>
<Q>For as he was among the Labourers who bound up the Sheafs in the Fields, the Heat &s;truck upon his Head, and he was taken ill; he went to Bed, and he died.</Q>
The Signs which precede and attend this Di&s;ea&s;e are, being ex|po&s;ed in a Place where the Sun &s;hines forth with great Force and Ardour; a violent Head-ach, attended with a very hot and ex|tremely dry Skin: the Eyes are al&s;o dry and red, being neither able to remain open, nor yet to bear the Light; and &s;ometimes there is a Kind of continual and involuntary Motion in the Eye|lid; while &s;ome Degree of Relief is perceivable from the Appli|cation of any cooling Liquor. It often happens that &s;ome can|not po&s;&s;ibly &s;leep; and at other times they have a great Drow&s;i|ne&s;s, but interrupted with outrageous Wakenings: there is a very &s;trong Fever, a great Faintne&s;s, and a total Di&s;reli&s;h and Loathing. Sometimes the Patient is very thir&s;ty, and at other times not at all: and the Skin of his Face often looks as though it were burnt.</P>
<P>&sect; 153. People may be afflicted with the Di&s;ea&s;e from this Cau&s;e, at two different Sea&s;ons of the Year; that is, either in the Spring, or during the very raging Heats; but their Events are very different. Country People and Labourers are but little liable to the former. It chiefly affects the Inhabitants of Cities,
<PB N="84" REF="012243_0104_0F8A6AE61D488948">
and delicate Per&s;ons, who have u&s;ed very little Exerci&s;e in the Winter, and abound with &s;uperfluous Humours. If, thus cir|cum&s;tanced, they expo&s;e them&s;elves to the Sun, as even in the Spring he attains a con&s;iderable Force; and, by the Cour&s;e of Life they have led, their Humours are already much di&s;po&s;ed to mount to the Head; while the Coolne&s;s of the Soil, e&s;pecially when it has rained, prevents their Feet from being &s;o ea&s;ily warmed; the Power of the Sun acts upon the Head like a Bli&s;ter, attracting a great Quantity of Humours to it. This produces ex|cruciating Pains of the Head, frequently accompanied with quick and violent Shootings, and with Pain in the Eyes; notwith&s;tand|ing this Degree of the Malady is &s;eldom dangerous. Country People, and even &s;uch Inhabitants of Cities and Towns, as have not forborn to exerci&s;e them&s;elves in Winter, have no Sort of Dread of the&s;e Strokes of the Sun, in the Spring of the Year. Its Summer Strokes are much more trouble&s;ome and vehement, and a&s;&s;ault Labourers and Travellers, who are for a long time expo&s;ed to the Fervour of it. Then it is that the Di&s;ea&s;e is ag|gravated to its highe&s;t Pitch, tho&s;e who are thus &s;truck often dying upon the Spot. In the hot Climates this Cau&s;e de&s;troys many in the very Streets, and makes dreadful Havock among Armies on the March, and at Sieges. Some tragical Effects of it, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, are &s;een even in the temperate Countries. After hav|ing marched a whole Day in the Sun, a Man &s;hall fall into a Le|thargy, and die within &s;ome Hours, with the Symptoms of raving Madne&s;s. I have &s;een a Tyler, in a very hot Day, complaining to his Comrade of a violent Pain in his Head, which increa&s;ed almo&s;t every Moment; and at the very In&s;tant when he purpo&s;ed to retire out of the Sun, he &s;unk down dead, and fell from the Hou&s;e which he was &s;lating. This &s;ame Cau&s;e produces very of|ten in the Country &s;ome mo&s;t dangerous Phrenzies, which are cal|led there hot or burning Fevers. Every Year furni&s;hes but too many of them.</P>
<P>&sect; 154. The Vehemence of the Sun is &s;till more dangerous to tho&s;e, who venture to &s;leep expo&s;ed to it. Two Mowers who fell a&s;leep on a Haycock, being wakened by &s;ome others, immediately on waking, &s;taggered, and pronouncing a few incoherent un|meaning Words, died. When the Violence of Wine and that of the Sun are combined, they kill very &s;uddenly: nor is there a &s;ingle Year in which Pea&s;ants are not found dead on the High|roads; who, being drunk, endeavoured to lie down in &s;ome Corner, where they peri&s;hed by an Apoplexy, from the Heat of the Sun and of &s;trong Drink. Tho&s;e of them who e&s;cape &s;o &s;peedy and premature a Death, are &s;ubject, for the Remainder of their Lives, to chronical, or tedious Head-achs; and to &s;uffer &s;ome little Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion in their Ideas. I have &s;een &s;ome Ca&s;es, when after violent Head-achs of &s;ome Days Conti|nuance, the Di&s;ea&s;e has been transferred to the Eyelids, which continued a long Time red and di&s;tended, &s;o that they could not
<PB N="85" REF="012243_0105_0F8A6AE9095505D8">
be kept a&s;under or open. It has al&s;o been known, that &s;ome Per&s;ons have been &s;truck by the Sun into a <HI>Delirium</HI> or Raving, without a Fever, and without complaining of a Head-ach. Some|times a <HI>Gutta Serena</HI> has been its Con&s;equence; and it is very com|mon to &s;ee People, who&s;e long Continuance under the &s;trong Light and Influence of the Sun, has made &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Eyes, as pre&s;ents them with different Bodies flying about in the Air, which di&s;tract and confu&s;e their Sight.</P>
<P>A Man of forty-two Years of Age, having been expo&s;ed for &s;everal Hours to the violent Heat of the Sun, with a very &s;mall Cap or Bonnet; and having pa&s;t the following Night in the open Air, was attacked the next Day with a mo&s;t &s;evere Head-ach, a burning Fever, Reachings to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">omit, great Angui&s;h, and red and &s;parkling Eyes. Notwith&s;tanding the be&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;everal Phy|&s;icians, he became phrenitic on the fifth Day, and died on the ninth. Suppurated Matter was di&s;charged from his Mouth, one of his No&s;trils, and his right Ear, a few Hours before his Death; upon Di&s;&s;ection a &s;mall Ab&s;ce&s;s, was found within the Skull; and the whole Brain, as well as all the Membranes inclo&s;ing it, were entirely corrupted.</P>
<P>&sect; 155. In very young Children, who are not, or never &s;hould be, expo&s;ed for any long Time to &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive Heat (and whom a &s;light Cau&s;e will often affect) this Malady di&s;covers it&s;elf by a heavy deep Drow&s;ine&s;s, which la&s;ts for &s;everal Days; al&s;o by in|ce&s;&s;ant Ravings mingled with Rage and Terror, much the &s;ame as when they are affected with violent Fear; and &s;ometimes by convul&s;ive Twitchings; by Head-achs which return at certain Pe|riods, and continual Vomitings. I have &s;een Children, who, after a Stroke of the Sun, have been harra&s;&s;ed a long time with a little Cough.</P>
<P>&sect; 156. Old Men who often expo&s;e them&s;elves imprudently to the Sun, are little apprized of all the Danger they incur by it. A certain Per&s;on, who purpo&s;ely &s;unned him&s;elf for a con&s;idera|ble time, in the clear Day of an intermitting tertian Fever, un|derwent the A&s;&s;ault of an Apoplexy, which carried him off the following Day. And even when the Di&s;ea&s;e may not be &s;o &s;peedy and violent, yet this Cu&s;tom (of &s;unning in hot Weather) certainly di&s;po&s;es to an Apoplexy, and to Di&s;orders of the Head. One of the &s;lighte&s;t Effects of much &s;olar Heat upon the Head is, to cau&s;e a Defluxion from the Brain, a Swelling of the Glands of the Neck, and a Dryne&s;s of the Eyes, which &s;ometimes conti|nues for a con&s;iderable Term after it.</P>
<P>&sect; 157. The Effect of too much culinary, or common Fire, is of the &s;ame Quality with that of the Sun. A Man who fell a&s;leep with his Head directly oppo&s;ite, and probably, very near to the Fire, went off in an Apoplexy, during his Nap.</P>
<P>&sect; 158. The Action of too violent a Sun is not only pernicious, when it falls upon the Head; but it is al&s;o hurtful to other Parts; and tho&s;e who continue long expo&s;ed to it, though their Heads
<PB N="86" REF="012243_0106_0F8A6AE93908A5A0">
&s;hould not be affected, experience violent Pains, a di&s;agreeable Sen&s;ation of Heat, and a con&s;iderable Stiffne&s;s in the Parts that have been, in &s;ome Manner, parched by it; as in the Legs, the Knees, the Thighs, Reins, and Arms; and &s;ometimes they prove feveri&s;h.</P>
<P>&sect; 159. In contemplating the Ca&s;e of a Patient, <HI>Sun-&s;truck,</HI> as we may term it, we mu&s;t endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h, whether there may not be al&s;o &s;ome other joint Cau&s;es concurring to the Ef|fect. A Traveller, a labouring Man, is often as much affected by the Fatigue of his Journey, or of his Labour, as he is by the In|fluence of &s;olar Heat.</P>
<P>&sect; 160. It is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et about the Cure of this Di&s;ea&s;e, as as &s;oon as ever we are &s;atisfied of its Exi&s;tence: for &s;uch as might have been ea&s;ily pre&s;erved by an early Application, are con&s;idera|bly endangered by a Neglect of it. The Method of treating this is very much the &s;ame, with that of the inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;es al|ready mentioned; that is, by Bleeding, and cooling Medicines of various Kinds in their Drinks, by Bathings, and by Gly&s;ters. And 1. If the Di&s;ea&s;e be very high and urgent, a large Quantity of Blood &s;hould be taken away, and occa&s;ionally re|peated. LEWIS the XIV. was bled nine times to prevent the Fa|tality of a Stroke of the Sun, which he received in Hunting in 1658.</P>
<P>2. After Bleeding, the Patient's Legs &s;hould be plunged into warm Water. This is one of the Applications that affords the mo&s;t &s;peedy Relief; and I have &s;een the Head-ach go off and re|turn again, in Proportion to the Repetition, and the Duration of the&s;e Bathings of the Legs. When the Di&s;order is highly dan|gerous, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to treat the Patient with <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">pia,</HI> or warm Baths, in which he may &s;it up to his Hips; and in the mo&s;t dangerous Degrees of it, even to bathe the whole Body: but the Water in this Ca&s;e, as well as in Bathings of the Feet, &s;hould be only &s;en&s;ibly warm: the U&s;e of hot would be highly pernicious.</P>
<P>3. Gly&s;ters made from a Decoction of any of the emollient Herbs are al&s;o very effectual.</P>
<P>4. The Patient &s;hould drink plentifully of Almond Emul&s;ion No. 4; of Limonade, which is a Mixture of the Juice of Lemons and Water, (and is the be&s;t Drink in this Di&s;ea&s;e) of Water and Vinegar, which is a very good Sub&s;titute for Limonade; and of, what is &s;till more efficacious, very clear Whey, with the Addition of a little Vinegar. The&s;e various Drinks may all be taken cold; Linen Cloths dipt in cold Water and Vinegar of Ro&s;es may be ap|plied to the Forehead, the Temples, or all over the Head, which is equivalent to every other Application u&s;ed upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions. Tho&s;e which are the mo&s;t cried up, are the Juice of Pur&s;lain, of Lettuce, of Hou&s;eleek, and of Vervain. The Drink No. 32 is al&s;o &s;erviceable, taken every Morning fa&s;ting.</P>
<P>&sect; 161. Cold Baths have &s;ometimes recovered Per&s;ons out of &s;uch violent Symptoms, from this Cau&s;e, as have been almo&s;t quite de&s;paired of.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="012243_0107_0F8A6AEA3A50D158">A Man twenty Years of Age, having been a very long time ex|po&s;ed to the &s;corching Sun, became violently delirious, without a Fever, and proved really mad. After repeated Bleedings, he was thrown into a cold Bath, which was al&s;o frequently repeated; pouring cold Water, at the &s;ame time, upon his Head. With &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance he recovered, though very gradually.</P>
<P>An Officer who had rode Po&s;t for &s;everal Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, in very hot Weather, &s;wooned away, immediately on di&s;mounting; from which he could not be recovered by the ordinary A&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;uch Ca&s;es. He was &s;aved however, in Con&s;equence of being plunged into a Bath of freezing Water. It &s;hould be ob&s;erved however, that in the&s;e Ca&s;es the cold Bath &s;hould never be re|curred to, without previous Bleeding.</P>
<P>&sect; 162. It is pa&s;t Doubt, that if a Per&s;on &s;tands &s;till in the vio|lent Heat of the Sun, he is more liable to be &s;truck with it, than if he walks about; and the U&s;e of white Hats, or of &s;ome Folds of clean white Paper under a black one, may &s;en&s;ibly contribute to prevent any Injury from the con&s;iderable Heat of the Sun; though it is a very incompetent Defence again&s;t a violent Degree of it.</P>
<P>The natural Con&s;titution, or even that Con&s;titution, which has been formed from long Cu&s;tom and Habit, makes a very great Difference between the Effects of &s;olar Heat on different Per&s;ons, People in&s;en&s;ibly accu&s;tom them&s;elves to the Impre&s;&s;ions of it, as they do to tho&s;e of all the other Bodies and Elements, which are continually acting upon us; and by Degrees we arrive at a Power of &s;u&s;taining his violent Heat with Impunity; ju&s;t as others arrive at the Hardine&s;s of bearing the mo&s;t rigid Colds, with very little Complaint or Inconvenience. The human Body is capable of &s;up|porting many more Violences and Extremes, than it commonly does. Its natural Force is &s;carcely ever a&s;certained among civi|lized Nations; becau&s;e their Education generally tends to impair and le&s;&s;en it, and always &s;ucceeds in this Re&s;pect. If we were inclined to con&s;ider a purely natural, a &s;imply phy&s;ical Man, we mu&s;t look for him among &s;avage Nations; where only we can di&s;cover what we are able to be, and to bear. We certainly could not fail of being Gainers, by adopting their corporal Education; neither does it &s;eem as yet to have been infallibly demon&s;trated, that we &s;hould be great Lo&s;ers in commuting our moral Education for theirs.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As &s;ome may think an Apology nece&s;&s;ary for a Tran&s;lation of this Chapter on a Di&s;ea&s;e, which never, or very &s;eldom, exi&s;ts in this or the adjacent I&s;land, I &s;hall ob&s;erve here, that, ab&s;tracted from the Immorality of a narrow and local Solicitude only for our&s;elves, we are politically intere&s;ted as a Nation always in Trade, and often at War, (and who&s;e Subjects are extended into very di&s;tant and and different Climates,) to provide again&s;t a &s;udden and acute Di&s;temper, to which our Armies, our Sailors and Colonies are certainly often expo&s;ed. A Fatality from this Cau&s;e is not re&s;trained to our I&s;lands within the Tropic, where &s;everal In&s;tances of it have occurred during the late War; but it has al&s;o been known to prevail as far northward as <HI>Pen&s;ylvania,</HI> in their Summers, and even in their Harve&s;ts, I once received a &s;en&s;ible Scald on the Back of my Thumb, from the Sun &s;uddenly darting out through a clear Hole, as it were, in a Cloud, after a &s;hort and impetuous Shower in Summer; which Scald manife&s;tly bli&s;tered within &s;ome Minutes after.

<HEAD>CHAPTER XI. Of the Rheumati&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 163. THE Rheumati&s;m may exi&s;t either with or without a Fever. The fir&s;t of the&s;e may be cla&s;&s;ed among the Di&s;ea&s;es, of which I have already treated; being an Inflammation which is manife&s;t|ed by a violent Fever, preceded by Shivering, a &s;ub&s;equent Heat, hard Pul&s;e, and a Head-ach. Sometimes indeed an extraordina|ry Coldne&s;s, with general Unea&s;ine&s;s and Inquietude, exi&s;ts &s;eve|ral Days before the Fever is perceived. On the &s;econd or third Day, and &s;ometimes even on the fir&s;t, the Patient is &s;eized with a violent Pain in &s;ome Part of his Body, but e&s;pecially about the Joints, which entirely prevents their Motion, and which is often accompanied with Heat, Redne&s;s, and a Swelling of the Part. The Knee is often the fir&s;t Part attacked, and &s;ometimes both the Knees at once. When the Pain is fixed, an Abatement of the Fever frequently happens; though in &s;ome Per&s;ons it conti|nues for &s;everal Days, and increa&s;es every Evening. The Pain dimini&s;hes in one Part after a Duration of &s;ome Days, and then invades &s;ome other. From the Knee it de&s;cends to the Foot, or mounts to the Hip, to the Loins, the Shoulder-blades, Elbow, Wri&s;t, the Nape of the Neck, and frequently is felt in the inter|mediate Parts. Sometimes one Part is quite free from Pain, when another is attacked; at other times many Parts are &s;eized nearly at the &s;ame In&s;tant; and I have &s;ometimes &s;een every Joint afflict|ed at once. In this Ca&s;e the Patient is in a very terrible Situa|tion, being incapable of any Motion, and even dreading the A&s;&s;i&s;|tance of his Attendants, as he can &s;carcely admit of touching, without a &s;en&s;ible Aggravation of his Pains. He is unable to bear even the Weight of the Bed-cloths, which mu&s;t be, as it were, arched over his Limbs by a proper Contrivance, to prevent their Pre&s;&s;ure: and the very walking acro&s;s the Chamber increa&s;es his Torments. The Parts in which they are the mo&s;t excruciating,
<PB N="89" REF="012243_0109_0F8A6AEB5908BCB8">
and ob&s;tinate, are the Region of the Loins, the Hips, and the Nape or hinder Part of the Neck.</P>
<P>&sect; 164. This Di&s;ea&s;e is al&s;o often extended over the Scalp and the Surface of the Head; and there the Pains are exce&s;&s;ive. I have &s;een them affect the Eyelids and the Teeth with inex|pre&s;&s;ible Torment. As long as the Di&s;temper is &s;ituated in the more external Parts, the Patient, however painful his Situation may prove, is in no great Danger, if he be properly treated: but if by &s;ome Accident, &s;ome Error, or by any latent Cau&s;e, the Di&s;ea&s;e be repelled upon an internal Part or Organ, his Ca&s;e is extremely dangerous. If the Brain is attacked, a frantic raging <HI>Delirium</HI> is the Con&s;equence; if it falls upon the Lungs, the Pa|tient is &s;uffocated: and if it attacks the Stomach or the Bowels, it is attended with the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing Pains, which are cau&s;ed by the Inflammation of tho&s;e Parts, and which Inflammation, if violent, is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note * to Page 29.</NOTE> &s;peedily fatal. About two Years &s;ince I was called to a robu&s;t Man, who&s;e Guts were already in a gangrenous State, which was the Con&s;equence of a Rheumati&s;m, that fir&s;t attacked one Arm and one Knee; the Cure of which had been attempted by &s;weating the Patient with &s;ome hot Remedies. The&s;e indeed brought on a plentiful Sweat; but the inflammatory Humour &s;eized the Inte&s;tines, who&s;e Inflammation degenerated into a Gan|grene, after a Duration of the mo&s;t acute Pain for thirty-&s;ix Hours; his Torments terminating in Death two Hours after I &s;aw him.</P>
<P>&sect; 165. This Malady however is often in a le&s;s violent Degree; the Fever is but moderate, and cea&s;es entirely when the Pain be|gins; which is al&s;o confined to one; or not more than two Parts.</P>
<P>&sect; 166. If the Di&s;ea&s;e continues fixed, for a con&s;iderable time, in one Joint, the Motion of it is impaired for Life. I have &s;een a Per&s;on who has now a wry Neck, of twenty Years &s;tanding, in Con&s;equence of a Rheumati&s;m in the Nape of the Neck; and I al&s;o &s;aw a poor young Man from <HI>Jurat,</HI> who was Bed-ridden, and who had lo&s;t the Motion of one Hip and both Knees. He could neither &s;tand nor &s;it, and there were but a few Po&s;tures in which he could even lie in Bed.</P>
<P>&sect; 167. An ob&s;tructed Per&s;piration, and inflammatory Thick|ne&s;s of the Blood, con&s;titute the mo&s;t general Cau&s;e of the Rheu|mati&s;m. This la&s;t concurring Cau&s;e is that we mu&s;t immediately encounter; &s;ince, as long as that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, Per&s;piration cannot be perfectly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, which follows of Cour&s;e, when the Inflam|mation is cured. For which Rea&s;on this Di&s;temper mu&s;t be con|ducted like the other inflammatory ones, of which I have already treated.</P>
<P>&sect; 168. As &s;oon as it is &s;ufficiently manife&s;t, the Gly&s;ter No. 5 &s;hould be injected; and twelve Ounces of Blood be taken from
<PB N="90" REF="012243_0110_0F8A6AEC20F84EC0">
the Arm an Hour after. The Patient is to enter upon a Regi|men, and drink plentifully of the Pti&s;an No. 2, and of Almond Milk or Emul&s;ion No. 4. As this la&s;t Medicine may be too co&s;t|ly in Country Places for the poor Pea&s;antry; they may drink, in lieu of it, very clear Whey, &s;weetened with a little Honey. I have known a very &s;evere Rheumati&s;m cured, after twice bleed|ing, without any other Food or Medicine, for the Space of thir|teen Days. The Whey al&s;o may be happily u&s;ed by Way of Gly&s;ter.</P>
<P>&sect; 169. If the Di&s;temper is not con&s;iderably a&s;&s;waged by the fir&s;t Bleeding, it &s;hould be repeated &s;ome Hours after. I have or|dered it four times within the fir&s;t two Days; and &s;ome Days af|ter I have even directed a fifth Bleeding. But in general the Hardne&s;s of the Pul&s;e becomes le&s;s after the &s;econd: and notwith|&s;tanding the Pains may continue as &s;evere as before, yet the Pa|tient is &s;en&s;ible of le&s;s Inquietude. The Gly&s;ter mu&s;t be repeated every Day, and even twice a Day, if each of them is attended only with a &s;mall Di&s;charge; and particularly if there be a vio|lent Head-ach. In &s;uch Ca&s;es as are exce&s;&s;ively painful, the Pa|tient can &s;carcely di&s;po&s;e him&s;elf into a proper Attitude or Po&s;ture to receive Gly&s;ters; and in &s;uch Circum&s;tances his Drinks &s;hould be made as opening as po&s;&s;ible; and a Do&s;e of the Cream of Tar|tar No. 24 &s;hould be given Night and Morning. This very Me|dicine, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Whey, cured two Per&s;ons I advi&s;ed it to, of rheumatic Pains, with frequent Returns of which they had been infe&s;ted for many Years, and which were attended with a &s;mall Fever.</P>
<P>Apples coddled, Prunes &s;tewed, and well ripened Summer Fruits are the propere&s;t Nouri&s;hment in this Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>We may &s;ave the Sick a good deal of Pain, by putting one &s;trong Towel always under their Back, and another under their Thighs, in order to move them the more ea&s;ily. When their Hands are without Pain, a third Towel hung upon a Cord, which is fa&s;tened acro&s;s the Bed, mu&s;t con&s;iderably a&s;&s;i&s;t them in mov|ing them&s;elves.</P>
<P>&sect; 170. When the Fever entirely di&s;appears, and the Hardne&s;s of the Pul&s;e is removed, I have ordered the Purge No. 23, with a very good Effect; and if it is attended with five or &s;ix Motions, the Patient is very &s;en&s;ibly relieved. The Day but one after, it may be repeated &s;ucce&s;sfully, and a third time, after an Interval of a greater Number of Days.</P>
<P>&sect; 171. When the Pains are extremely violent, they admit of no Application: Vapour-Baths however may be employed, and provided they are often u&s;ed, and for a con&s;iderable time, they prove very efficacious. The Purpo&s;e of the&s;e Baths is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly to convey the Steam of boiling Water to the Parts affected; which may always ea&s;ily be effected; by a Variety of &s;imple and ea&s;y Contrivances; the Choice of which mu&s;t depend on the different Circum&s;tances and Situation of the Sick.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="012243_0111_0F8A6AECDBD5CB20">Whenever it is po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome of the emollient Applications, No. 9, &s;hould be continually employed. A half Bath, or an entire Bath of warm Water, in which the Patient &s;hould remain an Hour, after &s;ufficient Bleedings and many Gly&s;ters, affords the greate&s;t Relief. I have &s;een a Patient, under the mo&s;t acute Pains of the Loins, of the Hips, and of one Knee, put into one. He continued &s;till under extreme Torment in the Bath, and on being taken out of it: but an Hour after he had been put to Bed, he &s;weated, to an incredible Quantity, for thirty-&s;ix Hours, and was cured. The Bath &s;hould never be made u&s;e of, until af|ter repeated Bleeding&s;, or at lea&s;t other equivalent Evacuations: for otherwi&s;e timed, it would aggravate the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; 172. The Pains are generally mo&s;t &s;evere in the Night; whence it has been u&s;ual to give compo&s;ing &s;oporific Medicines. This however has been very erroneous, as Opiates really augment the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e; they de&s;troy the Efficacy of the proper Remedies: and, even not &s;eldom, far from a&s;&s;waging the Pains, they increa&s;e them. Indeed they agree &s;o little in this Di&s;ea&s;e, that even the Patient's natural Sleep at the Inva&s;ion of this Com|plaint, is rather to his Detriment. They feel, the very Moment they are dropping a&s;leep, &s;uch violent Jirks as awaken them with great Pain: or if they do &s;leep a few Minutes, the Pains are &s;tronger when they awake.</P>
<P>&sect; 173. The Rheumati&s;m goes off either by Stool, by turbid thick Urine which drops a great Proportion of a yellowi&s;h Sedi|ment, or by Sweats; and it generally happens that this la&s;t Di&s;|charge prevails towards the Conclu&s;ion of the Di&s;ea&s;e. It may be kept up by drinking an Infu&s;ion of Elder-flowers. At the Be|ginning however Sweating is pernicious.</P>
<P>&sect; 174. It happens al&s;o, though but very &s;eldom, that Rheu|mati&s;ms determine by depo&s;iting a &s;harp Humour upon the Legs; where it forms Ve&s;ications, or a kind of Bli&s;terings, which bur&s;t open and form Ulcers, that ought not to be healed and dried up too ha&s;tily; as this would occa&s;ion a &s;peedy Return of the rheu|matic Pains. They are di&s;po&s;ed to heal naturally of them&s;elves, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a temperate regular Diet, and a few gentle Purges.</P>
<P>&sect; 175. Sometimes again, an Ab&s;ce&s;s is formed either in the af|fected Part, or in &s;ome neighbouring one. I have &s;een a Vine|yard Dre&s;&s;er, who after violent Pains of the Loins, had an Ab&s;ce&s;s in the upper Part of the Thigh, which he neglected for a long time. When I &s;aw him it was of a mon&s;trous Size. I ordered it to be opened, when at once above three Pots of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, according to our Author's E&s;timation of the Pot-Mea&s;ure at <HI>Berne,</HI> which is that he always means, and which he &s;ays contains exactly (of Water we &s;uppo&s;e) fifty one Ounces and a Quarter (though without a material Error it may be computed at three Pounds and a Quarter) will amount at lea&s;t to nine Pounds and three Quarters of Matter, &s;uppo&s;ing this no heavier than Water. By Mea&s;ure it will want but little of five of our Quarts; a very extraordinary Bathings indeed of <HI>Pus</HI> at once, and not unlikely to be attended by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which &s;oon followed.</NOTE> Matter ru&s;hed

out of it: but the Patient, being exhau&s;ted, died &s;ome time after it.</P>
<P>Another Cri&s;is of the Rheumati&s;m has happened by a kind of Itch, which breaks out upon all the Parts adjacent to the Seat of this Di&s;ea&s;e. Immediately after this Eruption the Pains vani&s;h: but the Pu&s;tules &s;ometimes continue for &s;everal Weeks.</P>
<P>&sect; 176. I have never ob&s;erved the Pains to la&s;t, with con&s;idera|ble Violence, above fourteen Days, in this Species of the Rheu|mati&s;m; though there remains a Weakne&s;s, Numbne&s;s, and &s;ome Inflation, or Puffing, of the adjoining Parts: and it will al&s;o be many Weeks, and &s;ometimes even Months; e&s;pecially if the Di&s;|temper attacked them in the Fall,) before the Sick recover their u&s;ual Strength. I have known &s;ome Per&s;ons, who, after a very painful Rheumati&s;m, have been troubled with a very di&s;agreeable Sen&s;ation of La&s;&s;itude; which did not go off till after a great E|ruption, all over the Body, of little Ve&s;ications or Bli&s;terings, full of a watery Humour; many of them bur&s;t open, and others withered and dried up without bur&s;ting.</P>
<P>&sect; 177. The Return of Strength into the Parts affected may be promoted by Frictions Night and Morning, with Flanel or any other woollen Stuff; by u&s;ing Exerci&s;e; and by conforming ex|actly to the Directions given in the Chapter on Convale&s;cence, or Recovery from acute Di&s;ea&s;es. The Rheumati&s;m may al&s;o be prevented by the Means I have pointed out, in treating of Pleuri|&s;ies and Quinceys.</P>
<P>&sect; 178. Sometimes the Rheumati&s;m with a Fever, invades Per|&s;ons who are not &s;o &s;anguine, or abounding in Blood; or who&s;e Blood is not &s;o much di&s;po&s;ed to Inflammation; tho&s;e who&s;e Fle&s;h and Fibres are &s;ofter; and in who&s;e Humours there is more Thinne&s;s and Sharpne&s;s, than Vi&s;cidity and Thickne&s;s. Bleed|ing proves le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for Per&s;ons &s;o con&s;tituted, notwith&s;tand|ing the Fever &s;hould be very &s;trong. Some Con&s;titutions require more Di&s;charges by Stool; and after they are properly evacuated, &s;ome Bli&s;ters &s;hould be applied, which often afford them a &s;en&s;i|ble Relief as &s;oon as ever they begin to operate. Neverthele&s;s they &s;hould never be u&s;ed where the Pul&s;e is hard. The Powder No. 25 an&s;wers very well in the&s;e Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>&sect; 179. There is another Kind of Rheumati&s;m called chroni|cal or la&s;ting. It is known by the following Characters or Marks. 1. It is commonly unattended with a Fever. 2. It continues a very long time. 3. It &s;eldom attacks &s;o many Parts at once as the former. 4. Frequently no vi&s;ible Alteration appears in the affected Part, which is neither more hot, red, or &s;welled, than in its healthy State; though &s;ometimes one or other of the&s;e Symp|toms is evident. 5. The former, the inflammatory Rheumati&s;m, a&s;&s;aults &s;trong, vigorous, robu&s;t Per&s;ons: but this rather invades People arrived at a certain Period of Life, or &s;uch as are weak and langui&s;hing.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="012243_0113_0F8A6AEE4F221D70">&sect; 180. The Pain of the chronical Rheumati&s;m, when left to it&s;elf, or injudiciou&s;ly treated, la&s;ts &s;ometimes many Months, and even Years. It is particularly and extremely ob&s;tinate, when it is exerted on the Head, the Loins, or on the Hip, and along the Thighs, when it is called the <HI>Sciatica.</HI> There is no Part indeed which this Pain may not invade; &s;ometimes it fixes it&s;elf in a &s;mall Spot, as in one Corner of the Head; the Angle of the Jaw; the Extremity of a Finger; in one Knee; on one Rib, or on the Brea&s;t, where it often excites Pains, which make the Patient ap|prehen&s;ive of a Cancer. It penetrates al&s;o to the internal Parts. When it affects the Lungs, a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate Cough is the Con&s;e|quence; which degenerates at length into very dangerous Di&s;or|orders of the Brea&s;t. In the Stomach and Bowels it excites mo&s;t violent Pains like a Cholic; and in the Bladder, Symptoms &s;o greatly re&s;embling tho&s;e of the Stone, that Per&s;ons who are nei|ther deficient in Knowledge nor Experience, have been more than once deceived by them.</P>
<P>&sect; 181. The Treatment of this chronical Rheumati&s;m does not vary con&s;iderably from that of the former. Neverthele&s;s, in the fir&s;t Place, if the Pain is very acute, and the Patient robu&s;t, a &s;in|gle Bleeding at the On&s;et is very proper and efficacious. 2. The Humours ought to be diluted, and their Acrimony or Sharpne&s;s &s;hould be dimini&s;hed, by a very plentiful U&s;e of a Pti&s;an of <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Half a Pint of a pretty &s;trong Infu&s;ion of the Leaves of Buckbean, which grows wild here, taken once a Day rather before Noon, has al&s;o been found ve|ry &s;erviceable in that Species of a chronical Rheumati&s;m, which con&s;iderably re|&s;ults from a &s;corbutic State of the Con&s;titution. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> Burdock Roots No. 26. 3. Four or five Days after drinking a|bundantly of this, the Purging <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Another very good Purge, in this Kind of Rheumati&s;m, may al&s;o be compounded of the be&s;t Gum Guiacum in Powder from twenty-five to forty Grains; di&s;&s;olved in a little Yolk of a fre&s;h Egg; adding from five to ten Grains of Jallap powdered, and from three to five Grains of powdered Ginger, with as much plain or Surfeit Water, as will make a purging Draught for a &s;tronger or weaker grown Patient. Should the Pains frequently infe&s;t the Sto|mach, while the Patient continues co&s;tive, and there is no other Fever than &s;uch a &s;mall &s;ymptomatic one, as may ari&s;e &s;olely from Pain, he may &s;afely take, if grown up and &s;trong, from thirty to forty, and, if weaker, from twenty to thirty Drops of the volatile Tincture of Gum Guiacum, in any diluting Infu|&s;ion, that may not coagulate or &s;eparate the Gum. It generally di&s;po&s;es at fir&s;t to a gentle <HI>Diaphore&s;is</HI> or Sweat, and &s;everal Hours after to one, and &s;ometimes to a &s;econd Stool, with little or no Griping. It may be taken at going to Bed. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> Powder No. 21, may be taken with Succe&s;s. In this Species of the Rheumati&s;m a certain Medi|cine is &s;ometimes found &s;erviceable.

I &s;hall ob&s;erve, however, that this Medicine has done Mi&s;chief in the inflammatory Rheumati&s;m, and even in

this, as often as the Per&s;ons afflicted with it are feeble, thin and of a hot Temperament; and either when they have not previou&s;|ly taken diluting Drinks, or when it has been u&s;ed too long. For, in &s;uch a Circum&s;tance, it is apt to throw the Patient into an ir|recoverable Weakne&s;s. The Compo&s;ition con&s;i&s;ts of the hotte&s;t Spices, and of very &s;harp Purgatives.</P>
<P>&sect; 182. When general Remedies have been u&s;ed, and the Di&s;|order &s;till continues, Recour&s;e &s;hould be had to &s;uch Medicines, as are available to re&s;tore Per&s;piration; and the&s;e &s;hould be per|&s;i&s;ted in for a con&s;iderable Time. The Pills No. 18, with a &s;trong Infu&s;ion of Elder-flowers, have often &s;ucceeded in this Re&s;pect: and then after a long Continuance of diluting Drinks, if the Fe|ver is entirely &s;ubdued; if the Stomach exerts its Functions well; if the Patient is no ways co&s;tive; if he is not of a dry Habit of Body; and if the Part affected remains without Inflammation, the Patient may &s;afely take the Powder <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was erroneou&s;ly printed in the &s;econd Edition, No. 29.</NOTE> No. 25, at Night going to Bed, with a Cup or two of an Infu&s;ion of <HI>Carduus Benedictus,</HI> or the ble&s;&s;ed Thi&s;tle, and a Mor&s;el of Venice Treacle of the Size of a Hazel Nut, or a Filberd. This Remedy brings on a very co|pious Sweating, which often expels the <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Gum Guiacum, given from &s;ix to ten Grains Morning and Night, is of|ten very &s;ucce&s;sful in the&s;e Ca&s;es.

The&s;e Sweats may be rendered &s;till more effectual, by wrapping up the affected Part in a Flanel dipt in the Decoction No. 27.</P>
<P>&sect; 183. But of all the&s;e Pains, the Sciatica is one of the mo&s;t te|dious and ob&s;tinate. Neverthele&s;s I have &s;een the greate&s;t Suc|ce&s;s, from the Application of &s;even or eight Cupping-Gla&s;&s;es to the tormented Part; by which, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of any o|ther Remedy, I have cured, in a few Hours, Sciaticas of many Years &s;tanding, which had baffled other Remedies. Bli&s;ters, or any &s;uch &s;timulating Plai&s;ters, as bring on a Suppuration and Di&s;|charge from the afflicted Part, contribute al&s;o frequently to the Cure: tho' le&s;s effectually than Cupping, which &s;hould be repeat|ed &s;everal times. Green Cere-cloth, commonly called Oil-cloth, (whether the Ingredients be &s;pread on Taffity or on Linen) being applied to the di&s;ea&s;ed Part, di&s;po&s;es it to &s;weat abundantly, and thus to di&s;charge the &s;harp Humour which occa&s;ions the Pain. Sometimes both the&s;e Applications, but e&s;pecially that &s;pread on Silk (which may be applied more exactly and clo&s;ely to the Part, and which is al&s;o &s;pread with a different Compo&s;ition) rai&s;e a little Ve&s;ication on the Part as Bli&s;ters do. A Plai&s;ter of Quick|lime and Honey blended together has cured inveterate Sciaticas. Oil of Eggs has &s;ometimes &s;ucceeded in &s;uch Ca&s;es. A Seton has al&s;o been &s;ucce&s;sfully made in the lower Part of the Thigh. Fi|nally &s;ome Pains which have not yielded to any of the&s;e Applica|tions, have been cured by actual burning, inflicted on the very
<PB N="95" REF="012243_0115_0F8A6AEFF8DB6798">
Spot, where the mo&s;t violent Pain has been felt; except &s;ome par|ticular Rea&s;on, drawn from an anatomical Knowledge of the Part, &s;hould determine the Surgeon not to apply it there. The Scull or Head &s;hould never be cauterized with a burning Iron.</P>
<P>&sect; 184. The hot Baths of <HI>Bourbon, Plombiers, Aix-la-Chapelle,</HI> and many others are often very efficacious in the&s;e chronical Pains; notwith&s;tanding I really think, there is no rheumatic Pain that may not be cured without them. The common People &s;ub&s;titute to the&s;e a Bath made of the Hu&s;k of Grapes, after their Juice is expre&s;&s;ed, which cure &s;ome by making them &s;weat abundantly. Cold Baths however are the be&s;t to keep off this Di&s;ea&s;e; but then they cannot always be &s;afely ventured on. Many Circum&s;tances render the U&s;e of them impracticable to particular Per&s;ons. Such as are &s;ubject to this chronical Rheumati&s;m, would do very well to rub their whole Bodies every Morning, if they could, but e|&s;pecially the afflicted Parts, with Flanel. This Habit keeps up Per&s;piration beyond any other A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and indeed &s;ometimes even increa&s;es it too much. It would be &s;erviceable al&s;o, if &s;uch Subjects of this cruel Di&s;ea&s;e wore Flanel all over their Skin, dur|ing the Winter. After a violent Rheumati&s;m, People &s;hould long be careful to avoid that cold and moi&s;t Air, which di&s;po&s;es them to relap&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; 185. Rheumatic People have too frequent a Recour&s;e to very improper and hurtful Medicines in this Di&s;temper, which daily produce very bad Con&s;equences. Such are &s;pirituous Medicines, Brandy, and Arquebu&s;ade Water. They either render the Pain more ob&s;tinate and fixed, by hardening the Skin; or they repell the Humour to &s;ome inward Part. And In&s;tances are not wanting of Per&s;ons who have died &s;uddenly, from the Application of Spirit of Wine upon the Parts that were violently afflicted with the Rheu|mati&s;m. It al&s;o happens &s;ometimes that the Humour, having no Outlet through the Skin, is thrown internally on the Bone and af|fects it. A very &s;ingular Fact occurred in this Re&s;pect, an Account of which may be &s;erviceable to &s;ome Per&s;ons afflicted with the Di&s;|ea&s;e. A Woman at Night was chaffing the Arm of her Hu&s;band, who had the Rheumati&s;m there, with Spirit of Wine; when a very lucky Accident prevented the Mi&s;chief &s;he might have occa|&s;ioned by it. The Spirit of Wine took Fire from the Flame of the Candle &s;he made u&s;e of, and burned the di&s;ea&s;ed Part. It was dre&s;t of cour&s;e, and the Suppuration that attended it, entire|ly cured the Rheumati&s;m.</P>
<P>Sharp and grea&s;y Unctions or Ointments produce very bad ef|fects, and are equally dangerous. A <HI>Caries,</HI> a Rottenne&s;s of the Bones, has en&s;ued upon the U&s;e of a Medicine called, the Bal&s;am of Sulphur with Turpentine. I was con&s;ulted in 1750, three Days before her Decea&s;e, about a Woman who had long endured acute rheumatic Pains. She had taken various Medicines, and, among the re&s;t, a con&s;iderable Quantity of a Pti&s;an, in which Antimony was blended with &s;ome purging Medicines, and a grea&s;y
<PB N="96" REF="012243_0116_0F8A6AF0B4CBDE80">
&s;pirituous Bal&s;am had been rubbed into the Part. The Fever, the Pains, and the Dryne&s;s of the Skin &s;oon increa&s;ed: the Bones of the Thighs and Arms became carious: and in moving the Pa|tient no more than was nece&s;&s;ary for her Relief and Convenience, without taking her out of her Bed, both Thighs and one Arm broke. So dreadful an Example &s;hould make People cautious of giving or applying Medicines incon&s;iderately, even in &s;uch Di&s;|ea&s;es, as appear but trifling in them&s;elves. I mu&s;t al&s;o inform my Readers, there are &s;ome rheumatic Pains, which admit of no Application; and that almo&s;t every Medicine aggravates them, In &s;uch Ca&s;es the afflicted mu&s;t content them&s;elves with keeping the Parts affected from the Impre&s;&s;ions of the Air, by a Flanel, or the Skin of &s;ome Animal with the Fur on.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o more advi&s;eable &s;ometimes to leave a &s;ufferable and inveterate Pain to it&s;elf, e&s;pecially in old or weakly People, than to employ too many Medicines, or &s;uch violent ones, as &s;hould affect them more importantly than the Pains did.</P>
<P>&sect; 186. If the Duration of the Pains fixed in the &s;ame Place, &s;hould cau&s;e &s;ome Degree of Stiffne&s;s in the Joint affected, it &s;hould be expo&s;ed twice a Day to the Vapour of warm Water, and dried well afterwards with hot Linen: then it &s;hould be well chaffed, and la&s;tly touched over with Ointment of Mar&s;h-mal|lows. Pumping, if &s;uperadded to this Vapour, con&s;iderably in|crea&s;es its Efficacy. I directed, for a Ca&s;e of this Sort, a very &s;imple Machine of white Tin, or Lattin, which combined the Application of the Steam and the Pump.</P>
<P>&sect; 187. Very young Children are &s;ometimes &s;ubject to &s;uch Vi|olent Pains, and &s;o general too, that they cannot bear touching in any Part without exce&s;&s;ive Crying. We mu&s;t be careful to a|void mi&s;taking the&s;e Ca&s;es, and not to treat them like Rheuma|ti&s;ms. They &s;ometimes are owing to Worms, and go off when the&s;e have been di&s;charged.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XII. Of the Bite of a mad Dog.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 188. MEN may contract the particular and raging Symptom, which is very generally peculiar to, and has thence been &s;uppo&s;ed characteri&s;tical of, this Di&s;ea&s;e from this mo&s;t common Cau&s;e, and that even without any Bite; but this happens very rarely indeed. It is properly a Di&s;temper belonging to the ca|nine <HI>Genus,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of the three Species of Dogs, Wolves, and Foxes, to whom only it &s;eems inherent and natural; &s;carcely e|ver
<PB N="97" REF="012243_0117_0F8A6AF1675E4328">
ari&s;ing in other Animals, without its being inflicted by them. Whenever there occurs one of them who breeds it, he bites o|thers, and thus the Poi&s;on, the Cau&s;e of this terrible Di&s;ea&s;e, is diffu&s;ed. Other Animals be&s;ides the canine Species, and Men them&s;elves being expo&s;ed to this Accident, do &s;ometimes contract the Di&s;ea&s;e in all its Rage and Horror: though it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that this is always an unfailing con&s;equence.</P>
<P>&sect; 189. If a Dog who u&s;ed to be lively and active, becomes all at once moapi&s;h and moro&s;e; if he has an Aver&s;ion to eat; a par|ticular and unu&s;ual Look about his Eyes; a Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, which appears from his continually running to and fro, we may be appre|hen&s;ive he is likely to prove mad; at which very In&s;tant he ought to be tied up &s;ecurely, that it may be in our Power to de&s;troy him as &s;oon as the Di&s;temper is evident. Perhaps it might be even &s;till &s;afer to kill him at once.</P>
<P>Whenever the Malady is certain, the Symptoms heighten pretty &s;oon. His Aver&s;ion to Food, but e&s;pecially to Drink, grows &s;tronger. He no longer &s;eems to know his Ma&s;ter; the Sound of his Voice changes; he &s;uffers no Per&s;on to handle or approach him; and bites tho&s;e who attempt it. He quits his ordinary Ha|bitation, marching on with his Head and his Tail hanging down|wards; his Tongue lolling half out, and covered with Foam or Slaver, which indeed not &s;eldom happens indifferently to all Dogs, Other Dogs &s;cent him, not &s;eldom at a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance, and fly him with an Air of Horror, which is a certain Indication of his Di&s;ea&s;e. Sometimes he contents him&s;elf with biting only tho&s;e who happen to be near him: while at other times becoming more enraged, he &s;prings to the right and left on all Men and Animals about him. He hurries away with manife&s;t Dread from whatever Waters occur to him: at length he falls down as &s;pent and ex|hau&s;ted; &s;ometimes he ri&s;es up again, and drags him&s;elf on for a little time, commonly dying the third, or, at the late&s;t, on the fourth Day after the manife&s;t Appearance of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;ometimes even &s;ooner.</P>
<P>&sect; 190. When a Per&s;on is bit by &s;uch a Dog, the Wound com|monly heals up as readily as if it was not in the lea&s;t poi&s;onous: but after the Expiration of a longer or &s;horter Term, from three Weeks to three Months, but mo&s;t commonly in about &s;ix Weeks, the Per&s;on bitten begins to perceive, in the Spot that was bit, a cer|tain dull obtu&s;e Pain. The Scar of it &s;wells, inflames, bur&s;ts open, and weeps out a &s;harp, foetid, and &s;anious, or &s;omewhat bloody Humour. At the &s;ame time the Patient becomes &s;ad and melan|cholly: he feels a kind of Indifference, In&s;en&s;ibility, and gene|ral Numbne&s;s; an almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant Coldne&s;s; a Difficulty of breathing; a continual Angui&s;h, and Pains in his Bowels. His Pul&s;e is weak and irregular, his Sleep re&s;tle&s;s, turbid, and con|fu&s;ed with Ravings, with &s;tarting up in Surprize, and with terri|ble Frights. His Di&s;charges by Stool are often much altered and irregular, and &s;mall cold Sweats appear at very &s;hort Intervals,
<PB N="98" REF="012243_0118_0F8A6AF319471990">
Sometimes there is al&s;o a &s;light Pain or Unea&s;ine&s;s in the Throat. Such is the fir&s;t Degree of this Di&s;ea&s;e, and it is called by &s;ome Phy&s;icians the dumb Rage, or Madne&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; 191. Its &s;econd Degree, the confirmed or downright Mad|ne&s;s, is attended with the following Symptoms. The Patient is afflicted with a violent Thir&s;t, and a Pain in drinking. Soon after this he avoids all Drink, but particularly Water, and within &s;ome Hours after, he even abhors it. This Horror becomes &s;o violent, that the bringing Water near his Lips, or into his Sight, the ve|ry Name of it, or of any other Drink; the Sight of Objects, which, from their Tran&s;parence, have any Re&s;emblance of Wa|ter, as a Looking-Gla&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> afflicts him with extreme Angui&s;h, and &s;ometimes even with Convul&s;ions. They continue however &s;till to &s;wallow (though not without violent Difficulty) a little Meat or Bread, and &s;ometimes a little Soup. Some even get down the liquid Medicines that are pre&s;cribed them, provided there be no Appearance of Water in them; or that Water is not mentioned to them, at the &s;ame time. Their Urine becomes thick and high-coloured, and &s;ometimes there is a Suppre&s;&s;ion or Stop|page of it. The Voice either grows hoar&s;e, or is almo&s;t entirely aboli&s;hed: but the Reports of the bitten barking like Dogs, are ridiculous and &s;uper&s;titious Fictions, void of any Foundation; as well as many other Fables that have been blended with the Hi&s;tory of this Di&s;temper. The Barking of Dogs, however, is very di&s;|agreeable to them. They are troubled with &s;hort <HI>Deliriums</HI> or Ravings, which are &s;ometimes mixed with Fury. It is at &s;uch Times that they &s;pit all around them; that they attempt al&s;o to bite, and &s;ometimes unhappily effect it. Their Looks are fixed, as it were, and &s;omewhat furious, and their Vi&s;age frequently red. It is pretty common for the&s;e mi&s;erable Patients to be &s;en&s;i|ble of the Approach of their raging Fit, and to conjure the By|&s;tanders to be upon their Guard. Many of them never have an In|clination to bite.

<P>&sect; 192. It is with the Spittle, and the Spittle only, that this dreadful Poi&s;on unites it&s;elf. And here it may be ob&s;erved, 1, That if the Wounds have been made through any of the Patient's Cloaths, they are le&s;s dangerous than tho&s;e inflicted immediately on the naked Skin. 2, That Animals who abound in Wool, or have very thick Hair, are often pre&s;erved from the mortal Impre&s;|&s;ion of the Poi&s;on; becau&s;e in the&s;e various Circum&s;tances, the Cloaths, the Hair, or the Wool have wiped, or even dried up, the Slaver of their Teeth. 3, The Bites inflicted by an infected Animal, very &s;oon after he has bitten many others, are le&s;s dan|gerous than the former Bites, becau&s;e their Slaver is le&s;&s;ened or exhau&s;ted. 4, If the Bite happens in the Face, or in the Neck, the Danger is greater, and the Operation of the Venom is quicker

<P>&sect; 193. A great Number of Remedies have been highly cried up, as famous for the Cure of this Di&s;ea&s;e; and, in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland</HI> particularly, the Root of the Eglantine or wild Ro&s;e, gathered at &s;ome particular times, under the favourable A&s;pects of the Moon, and dried with &s;ome extraordinary Precautions.

<P>&sect; 194. In &s;hort there is a Nece&s;&s;ity for de&s;troying or expelling the Poi&s;on it&s;elf, which Mercury effects, and is con&s;equently the Counterpoi&s;on of it.

<P>&sect; 196. If the raging Symptom, the Dread of Water, has alrea|dy appeared, and the Patient is &s;trong, and abounds with Blood, he &s;hould, 1, Be bled to a con&s;iderable Quantity, and this may be repeated twice, thrice, or even a fourth Time, if Circum&s;tan|ces require it.</P>

<P>6, Every three Hours a Do&s;e of the Powder No. 30, &s;hould be taken in a Cup of the Infu&s;ion of Lime-tree and Elder-flowers.</P>

<P>&sect; 198. It is certain that a Boy, in whom the raging Symptom of this Di&s;ea&s;e had ju&s;t appeared, was perfectly cured, by bathing all about the wounded Part with Sallad-oil, in which &s;ome Cam|phire and Opium were di&s;&s;olved; with the Addition of repeated Frictions of the Ointment No. 28, and making him take &s;ome <HI>Eau de Luce</HI> with a little Wine.

<P>&sect; 199. Dogs may be cured by rubbing in a triple Quantity of the &s;ame Ointment directed for Men, and by giving them the Bo|lus No. 33. But both the&s;e Means &s;hould be u&s;ed as &s;oon as ever they are bit. When the great Symptom is manife&s;t, there would be too much Danger in attempting to apply one, or to give the other; and they &s;hould be immediately killed. It might be well, however, to try if they would &s;wallow down the Bolus, on its being thrown to them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as ever Dogs are bit, they &s;hould be &s;afely tied up, and not let loo&s;e again, before the Expiration of three or four Months.</P>
<P>&sect; 200. A fal&s;e and dangerous Prejudice has prevailed with Re|gard to the Bites from Dogs, and it is this&mdash;That if a Dog who had bit any Per&s;on, without being mad at the time of his biting, &s;hould become mad afterwards, the Per&s;on &s;o formerly bitten, would prove mad too at the &s;ame time. Such a Notion is full as ab&s;urd, as it would be to affirm, that if two Per&s;ons had &s;lept in the &s;ame Bed, and that one of them &s;hould take the Itch, the Small-Pocks, or any other contagious Di&s;ea&s;e, ten or twelve Years af|terwards, that the other &s;hould al&s;o be infected with that he took, and at the &s;ame time too.</P>
<P>Of two Circum&s;tances, whenever a Per&s;on is bit, one mu&s;t cer|tainly be, either the Dog which gives the Bite, is about to be mad him&s;elf, in which Ca&s;e this would be evident in a few Days, and then it mu&s;t be &s;aid the Per&s;on was bitten by a mad Dog: Or el&s;e, that the Dog was ab&s;olutely found, having neither conceived, or bred in him&s;elf, nor received from without the Cau&s;e, the Prin|ciple of Madne&s;s: in which la&s;t Ca&s;e I a&s;k any Man in his Sen|&s;es,
<PB N="103" REF="012243_0123_0F8A6AFAA36EADC0">
if he could communicate it. No Per&s;on, no Thing imparts what it has not. This fal&s;e and crude Notion excites tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with it to a dangerous Action: they exerci&s;e that Li|berty the Laws unhappily allow them of killing the Dog; by which Means they are left uncertain of his State, and of their own Chance. This is a dreadful Uncertainty, and may be atten|ded with embarra&s;&s;ing and trouble&s;ome Con&s;equences, indepen|dant of the Poi&s;on it&s;elf. The rea&s;onable Conduct would be to fecure and ob&s;erve the Dog very clo&s;ely, in order to know cer|tainly whether he is, or is not, mad.</P>
<P>&sect; 201. It is no longer nece&s;&s;ary to repre&s;ent the Horror, the Barbarity and Guilt of that cruel Practice, which prevailed, not very long &s;ince, of &s;uffocating Per&s;ons in the Height of this Di&s;|ea&s;e, with the Bed-cloaths. or between Matra&s;&s;es. It is now pro|hibited in mo&s;t Countries; and doubtle&s;s will be puni&s;hed, or at lea&s;t ought to be, even in tho&s;e where as yet it is not.</P>
<P>Another Cruelty, of which we hope to &s;ee no repeated In&s;tance, is that of abandoning tho&s;e mi&s;erable Patients to them&s;elves, with|out the lea&s;t Re&s;ource or A&s;&s;i&s;tance: a mo&s;t dete&s;table Cu&s;tom e|ven in tho&s;e Times, when there was not the lea&s;t Hope of &s;aving them; and &s;till more criminal in our Days, when they may be re|covered effectually. I do again affirm, that it is not very often, the&s;e afflicted Patients are di&s;po&s;ed to bite; and that even when they are, they are afraid of doing it; and reque&s;t the By&s;tanders to keep out of their Reach: So that no Danger is incurred; op where there is any, it may ea&s;ily be avoided by a few Precau|tions.</P>

<P>&sect; 204.

<P><PB N="105" REF="012243_0125_0F8A6AFBE85E7CE8">This State continues for &s;ome Hours, at the Expiration of which the Fever abates a little in a Sweat, which is &s;ometimes a very large one: the Patient then finds him&s;elf better, but is not|with&s;tanding ca&s;t down, torpid or heavy, very &s;queami&s;h, with a Head-ach and Pain in the Back, and a Di&s;po&s;ition to be drow&s;y. The la&s;t Symptom indeed is not very common, except in Chil|dren, le&s;s than &s;even or eight Years of Age.</P>
<P>The Abatement of the Fever is of &s;mall Duration; and &s;ome Hours after, commonly towards the Evening, it returns with all its Attendants, and terminates again by Sweats, as before.</P>
<P>This State of the Di&s;ea&s;e la&s;ts three or four Days; at the End of which Term, and &s;eldom later, the fir&s;t Eruptions appear among the Sweat, which terminates the Paroxy&s;m or Return of the Fever. I have generally ob&s;erved the earlie&s;t Eruption to ap|pear in the Face, next to that on the Hands, on the fore Part of the Arms, on the Neck, and on the upper Part of the Brea&s;t. As &s;oon as the Eruption appears, if the Di&s;temper is of a gentle Kind and Di&s;po&s;ition, the Fever almo&s;t entirely vani&s;hes: the Pa|tient continues to &s;weat a little, or tran&s;pire; the Number of Eruptions increa&s;es, others coming out on the Back, the Sides, the Belly, the Thighs, the Legs, and the Feet. Sometimes they are pu&s;hed out very numerou&s;ly even to the Soles of the Feet; where, as they increa&s;e in Size, they often excite very &s;harp Pain, by Rea&s;on of the great Thickne&s;s and Hardne&s;s of the Skin in the&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>Frequently on the fir&s;t and &s;econd Day of Eruption (&s;peaking hitherto always of the mild Kind and Degree of the Di&s;ea&s;e) there returns again a very gentle Revival of the Fever towards the Evening, which, about the Termination of it, is attended with a con&s;iderable and final Eruption: though as often as the Fever ter|minates perfectly after the earlie&s;t Eruption, a very di&s;tinct and very &s;mall one is a pretty certain Con&s;equence. For though the Eruption is already, or &s;hould prove only moderate, the Fever, as I have before &s;aid, does not totally di&s;appear; a &s;mall Degree of it &s;till remaining, and heightening a little every Evening.</P>
<P>The&s;e Pu&s;tules, or Efflore&s;cences, on their fir&s;t Appearances, are only &s;o many very little red Spots, con&s;iderably re&s;embling a Flea|bite; but di&s;tingui&s;hable by a &s;mall white Point in the Middle, a little rai&s;ed above the re&s;t, which gradually increa&s;es in Size, with the Redne&s;s extended about it. They become whiter, in Propor|tion as they grow larger; and generally upon the &s;ixth Day, in|cluding that of their fir&s;t Eruption, they attain their utmo&s;t Mag|nitude, and are full of <HI>Pus</HI> or Matter. Some of them grow to the Size of a Pea, and &s;ome &s;till a little larger; but this never happens to the greate&s;t Number of them. From this time they begin to look yellowi&s;h, they gradually become dry, and fall off in brown Scales, in ten or eleven Days from their fir&s;t Appearance. As their Eruption occurred on different Days, they al&s;o wither and fall off &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. The Face is &s;ometimes clear of them,
<PB N="106" REF="012243_0126_0F8A6AFC9B40BEE0">
while Pu&s;tules &s;till are &s;een upon the Legs, not fully ripe, or &s;up|purated: and tho&s;e in the Soles of the Feet often remain much longer.</P>
<P>&sect; 205. The Skin is of cour&s;e extended or &s;tretched out by the Pu&s;tules; and after the Appearance of a certain Quantity, all the Inter&s;tices, or Parts between the Pu&s;tules, are red and bright, as it were, with a proportionable Inflation or Swelling of the Skin. The Face is the fir&s;t Part that appears bloated, from the Pu&s;tules there fir&s;t attaining their utmo&s;t Size: and this Inflation is &s;ome|times &s;o con&s;iderable, as to look mon&s;trous; the like happens al|&s;o to the Neck, and the Eyes are entirely clo&s;ed up by it. The Swelling of the Face abates in Proportion to the &s;cabbing and drying up of the Pu&s;tules; and then the Hands are puffed up prodigiou&s;ly. This happens &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to the Legs, the Tumour or Swelling being the Con&s;equence of the Pu&s;tules attaining their utmo&s;t Size, which happens by Succe&s;&s;ion, in the&s;e different Parts.</P>
<P>&sect; 206. Whenever there is a very con&s;iderable Eruption, the Fever is heightened at the time of Suppuration, which is not to be wondered at; one &s;ingle Boil excites a Fever: How is it po&s;&s;i|ble then that &s;ome hundreds, nay &s;ome thou&s;ands, of the&s;e little Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es &s;hould not excite one? This Fever is the mo&s;t dangerous Period, or Time of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and occurs between the ninth and the thirteenth Days; as many Circum&s;tances vary the Term of Suppuration, two or three Days. At this painful and perilous Sea&s;on then, the Patient becomes very hot, and thir&s;ty: he is harra&s;&s;ed with Pain; and finds it very difficult to di&s;cover a fa|vourable ea&s;y Po&s;ture. If the Malady runs very high, he has no Sleep; he raves, becomes greatly oppre&s;&s;ed, is &s;eized with a heavy Drow&s;ine&s;s; and when he dies, he dies either &s;uffocated or le|thargic, and &s;ometimes in a State compounded of both the&s;e Symptoms</P>
<P>The Pul&s;e, during this Fever of Suppuration, is &s;ometimes of an a&s;toni&s;hing Quickne&s;s, while the Swelling of the Wri&s;ts makes it &s;eem, in &s;ome Subjects, to be very &s;mall. The mo&s;t critical and dangerous Time is, when the Swellings of the Face, Head and Neck are in their highe&s;t Degree. Whenever the Swelling begins to fall, the Scabs on the Face to dry [<HI>&s;uppo&s;ing neither of the&s;e to be too &s;udden and premature, for the vi&s;ible Quantity of the Pu&s;|tules</HI>] and the Skin to &s;hrivel, as it were, the Quickne&s;s of the Pul&s;e abates a little, and the Danger dimini&s;hes. When the Pu&s;tules are very few, this &s;econd Fever is &s;o moderate, that it re|quires &s;ome Attention to di&s;cern it, &s;o that the Danger is next to none.</P>
<P>&sect; 207. Be&s;ides the&s;e Symptoms, there are &s;ome others, which require con&s;iderable Attention and Vigilance. One of the&s;e is the Sorene&s;s of the Throat, with which many Per&s;ons in the Small-Pocks are afflicted, as &s;oon as the Fever grows pretty &s;trong. It continues for two or three Days; feels very &s;trait and trouble|&s;ome

in the Action of Swallowing; and whenever the Di&s;ea&s;e is extremely acute, it entirely prevents Swallowing. It is commonly a&s;cribed to the Eruption of Pu&s;tules in the Throat; but this is a Mi&s;take, &s;uch Pu&s;tules being almo&s;t con&s;tantly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As Pu&s;tules are, and not very &s;eldom, vi&s;ible on the Tongue, and &s;ome|times on the Roof, even to its Proce&s;s called the Palate, which I have plainly &s;een; it &s;eems not very ea&s;y to a&s;&s;ign any in&s;uperable Ob&s;tacle to the Exi&s;tence of a few within the Throat; tho' this &s;carcely ever occurs, in the di&s;tinct Small-Pocks.

It be|gins, mo&s;t frequently, before the Eruption appears; if this Com|plaint is in a light Degree, it terminates upon the Eruption; and whenever it revives again in the Cour&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, it is al|ways in Proportion to the Degree of the Fever. Hence we may infer it does not ari&s;e from the Pu&s;tules, but is owing to the In|flammation; and as often as it is of any con&s;iderable Duration, it is almo&s;t ever attended with another Symptom, the Salivation, or a Di&s;charge of a great Quantity of Spittle, This Salivation rarely exi&s;ts, where the Di&s;ea&s;e is very gentle, or the Patient very young; and is full as rarely ab&s;ent, where it is &s;evere, and the Patient is pa&s;t &s;even or eight Years old; but when the Eruption is very confluent, and the Patient adult, or grown up, the Di&s;|charge is &s;urprizing. Under the&s;e Circum&s;tances it flows out in|ce&s;&s;antly, allowing the afflicted Patient no Re&s;t nor Re&s;pite, often incommoding him more than any other Symptom of the Di&s;tem|per; and &s;o much the more, as after its Continuance for &s;ome Days, the Lips, the In&s;ide of the Cheeks, the Tongue, and the Roof of the Mouth are entirely peeled or flead, as it were. Ne|verthele&s;s, however painful and embarra&s;&s;ing this Di&s;charge may prove, it is very important and &s;alutary. Meer Infants are le&s;s &s;ubject to it, &s;ome of them having a Loo&s;ene&s;s, in lieu of it: and yet I have ob&s;erved even this la&s;t Di&s;charge to be con&s;iderably le&s;s frequent in them, than a Salivation is in grown People.</P>
<P>&sect; 208. Children, to the Age of five or &s;ix Years, are liable to Convul&s;ions before Eruption: the&s;e however are not dangerous, if they are not accompanied with other grievous and violent Symp|toms. But &s;uch Convul&s;ions as &s;upervene either when Eruption, having already occured, &s;uddenly retreats, or <HI>&s;trikes in,</HI> accord|ing to the common Phra&s;e; or during the Cour&s;e of the Fever of Suppuration, are greatly more terrifying.</P>
<P>Involuntary Di&s;charges of Blood from the No&s;e often occur, in the fir&s;t Stages of this Di&s;temper, which are extremely &s;ervicea|ble, and commonly le&s;&s;en, or carry off, the Head-ach.

The Small-Pocks is commonly di&s;tingui&s;hed into two Kinds, the confluent and the di&s;tinct, &s;uch a Di&s;tinction really exi&s;ting in Nature: but as the Treatment of each of them is the &s;ame; and as the Quantity or Do&s;e of the Medicines is only to be varied, in Proportion to the Danger of the Patient (not to en|ter here into very tedious Details, and &s;uch as might exceed the Comprehen&s;ion of many of our Readers; as well as whatever might relate particularly to the malignant Small-Pocks) I &s;hall limit my&s;elf within the De&s;cription I have premi&s;ed, which in|cludes all the Symptoms common to both the&s;e Kinds of the Small-Pocks. I content my&s;elf with adding here, that we may expect a very confluent and dangerous Pock, if, at the very time of Sei|zure, the Patient is immediately attacked with many violent Symptoms; more e&s;pecially if his Eyes are extremely quick, live|ly, and even gli&s;tening, as it were; if he vomits almo&s;t continu|ally; if the Pain of his Loins be violent; and if he &s;uffers at the &s;ame time great Angui&s;h and Inquietude: if in Infants there is great <HI>Stupor</HI> or Heavine&s;s; if Eruption appears on the third Day, and &s;ometimes even on the &s;econd; as the ha&s;tier Eruptions in this Di&s;ea&s;e &s;ignify the mo&s;t dangerous Kind and Degree of it; and on the contrary, the flower Eruption is, it is the &s;afer too; &s;uppo|&s;ing this Slowne&s;s of the Eruption not to have been the Con&s;e|quence of great Weakne&s;s, or of &s;ome violent inward Pain.</P>
<P>&sect; 210. The Di&s;order is &s;ometimes &s;o very mild and &s;light, that Eruption appears with &s;carcely any Su&s;picion of the Child's having the lea&s;t Ailment, and the Event is as favourable as the Inva&s;ion. The Pu&s;tules appear, grow large, &s;uppurate, and attain their Ma|turity, without confining the Patient to his Bed, or le&s;&s;ening either his Sleep, or Appetite.</P>
<P>It is very common to &s;ee Children in the Country (and they are &s;eldom more than Children who have it &s;o very gently) run about in the open Air, through the whole Cour&s;e of this Di&s;ea&s;e, and feeding ju&s;t as they do in Health. Even tho&s;e who take it in a &s;omewhat higher Degree, commonly go out when Eruption is fini&s;hed, and give them&s;elves up, without Re&s;erve, to the Vora|city of their Hunger. Notwith&s;tanding all this Neglect, many get perfectly cured; though &s;uch a Conduct &s;hould never be pro|po&s;ed for Imitation, &s;ince Numbers have experienced its pernici|ous Con&s;equences; and &s;everal of the&s;e Children have been brought to me, e&s;pecially from <HI>Jurat,</HI> who, after &s;uch Neglect, in the Cour&s;e of the mild and kindly Sort of this Di&s;temper, have con|tracted Complaints and Infirmities of different Kinds which have been found very difficult to &s;ubdue.</P>
<P>&sect; 211. This &s;till continues to be one of tho&s;e Di&s;tempers, who&s;e Danger has long been increa&s;ed by its improper Treatment, and e&s;pecially by forcing the Patients into Sweats: and it &s;till conti|nues to be increa&s;ed, particularly among Country People. They have &s;een Eruption appear, while the Patient &s;weats, and ob&s;erved he found him&s;elf better after its Appearance: and hence they
<PB N="109" REF="012243_0129_0F8A6AFECC4E19C8">
conclude that, by quickening and forcing out this Eruption, they contributed to his Relief: and &s;uppo&s;e, that by increa&s;ing the Quantity of his Sweats, and the Number of his Eruptions, the Blood is the better cleared and purified from the Poi&s;on. The&s;e are mortal Errors, which daily Experience has demon&s;trated, by their tragical Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>When the Contagion or Poi&s;on, which generates this Di&s;ea&s;e, has been admitted into the Blood, it requires a certain Term to pro|duce its u&s;ual Effects: at which time the Blood being tainted by the Venom it has received, and by that which &s;uch Venom has formed or a&s;&s;imilated from it, Nature makes an Effort to free her|&s;elf of it, and to expel it by the Skin, preci&s;ely at the time when every thing is predi&s;po&s;ed for that Purpo&s;e. This Effort pretty generally &s;ucceeds being very often rather too rapid and violent, and very &s;eldom too weak. Hence it is evident, that whenever this Effort is deficient, it ought not to be heightened by hot Me|dicines or Means, which make it too violent and dangerous: for when it already exceeds in this Re&s;pect, a further Increa&s;e of &s;uch Violence mu&s;t render it mortal. There are but few Ca&s;es in which the Efforts of Nature, on this Occa&s;ion, are too languid and feeble, e&s;pecially in the Country; and whenever &s;uch rare Ca&s;es do occur, it is very difficult to form a ju&s;t and proper E&s;ti|mation of them: for which Rea&s;on we &s;hould be very re&s;erved and cautious in the U&s;e of heating Medicines, which are &s;o mor|tally pernicious in this Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Wine, Venice Treacle, cordial Confections, hot Air, and Loads of Bed-cloths, annually &s;weep off thou&s;ands of Children, who might have recovered, if they had taken nothing but warm Wa|ter; and every Per&s;on who is intere&s;ted in the Recovery of Pa|tients from this Di&s;temper, ought carefully to prevent the &s;malle&s;t U&s;e of &s;uch Drugs; which, if they &s;hould not immediately ag|gravate it to a fatal Degree, yet will certainly increa&s;e the Seve|rity and Torment of it, and annex the mo&s;t unhappy and tragi|cal Con&s;equences to it.</P>
<P>The Prejudice in this Point is &s;o &s;trongly rooted, that a total Eradication of it mu&s;t be very difficult: but I only de&s;ire Peo|ple would be convinced by their own Eyes, of the different Suc|ce&s;s of the hot Regimen, and of that I &s;hall propo&s;e. And here indeed I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I found more Attention and Docility, on this Point, among the Inhabitants of the City, and e&s;pecially in the la&s;t epidemical &s;preading of the Small-Pocks, than I pre|&s;umed to hope for. Not only as many as con&s;ulted me on the Inva&s;ion of it, complied exactly with the cooling Regimen I ad|vi&s;ed them; but their Neighbours al&s;o had Recour&s;e to it, when their Children &s;ickened: and being often called in when it had been many Days advanced, I ob&s;erved with great Plea&s;ure, that in many Hou&s;es, not one heating Medicine had been given; and great Care had been taken to keep the Air of the Patient's Cham|ber refre&s;hingly cool and temperate. This encourages me to ex|pect,
<PB N="110" REF="012243_0130_0F8A6AFFF14E1DB8">
that this Method hereafter will become general here. What certainly ought mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially to conduce to this is, that not|with&s;tanding the Diffu&s;ion or &s;preading of this Di&s;ea&s;e was as nu|merous and exten&s;ive as any of the former, the Mortality, in Con|&s;equence of it, was evidently le&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; 212. At the very Beginning of the Small-Pocks (which may be rea&s;onably &s;u&s;pected, from the Pre&s;ence of the Symptoms I have already de&s;cribed; &s;uppo&s;ing the Per&s;on complaining never to have had it, and the Di&s;ea&s;e to prevail near his Re&s;idence) the Patient is immediately to be put on a &s;trict Regimen, and to have his Legs bathed Night and Morning in warm Water. This is the mo&s;t proper and promi&s;ing Method to le&s;&s;en the Quantity of E|ruption in the Face and Head, and to facilitate it every where el&s;e on the Surface. Gly&s;ters al&s;o greatly contribute to abate the Head-ach, and to dimini&s;h the Reachings to vomit, and the ac|tual Vomitings, which greatly di&s;tre&s;s the Patient; but which however it is highly ab&s;urd and pernicious to &s;top by any &s;toma|chic cordial Confection, or by Venice Treacle; and &s;till more dangerous to attempt removing the Cau&s;e of them, by a Vomit or Purge, which are hurtful in the beginning of the Small-Pocks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Ti&s;&s;ot</HI> ju&s;tly propo&s;es Gly&s;ters in the inflammatory Apparatus of the Small-Pocks, and as judiciou&s;ly rejects the Practice of &s;topping the Reachings to vomit, by any cordial Confection or Opiate. But it is probable the Caution he gives again&s;t attempting to abate them by a Vomit or Purge, &s;hould, in &s;ome Ca&s;es at lea&s;t, be re&s;trained only to &s;uch of tho&s;e Evacuants, as have any Vio|lence in their Operation. Indi&s;putably this is an improper Stage for &s;timulating, or adding to the Agitation of the Blood; but where there was a rational Proba|bility of abating this Stimulation, and of guarding, or relieving the Head, either by gently indulging the Puking, if manife&s;tly bilious, with Draughts of warm Water, or of very light green Tea, we think this may be &s;afely and di&s;cretely al|lowed. In Ca&s;es too where a con&s;iderable Co&s;tivene&s;s had preceded the Attack of this Di&s;ea&s;e, and the Eyes and Countenance were highly inflamed, a little Man|na with Magne&s;ia Alba, or Cream of Tartar, or perhaps a Drachm or two of Glauber Salt, according to the Patient's Age, &amp;c. might be prudently ventured on: And if this, or the like Laxative, was not attended with any Di&s;charge in three or four Hours, one might be promoted by inviting it downward, with a moderately opening Gly&s;ter. The&s;e Means promi&s;e rationally to abate the vio|lent Efferve&s;cence, to re&s;train the Fever, &amp;c. as it is very common for Patients un|der frequent bilious Pukings before Eruption, to confe&s;s them&s;elves immediately ea&s;ier upon each Di&s;charge. After Eruption I have given a very &s;en&s;ible and im|mediate Relief to an inoculated Patient of twenty four Years, by allowing him to drink a Pint, or better of &s;mall, and pretty warm, green Tea, which brought on a con&s;iderable and very bitter Di&s;charge from his Stomach, and entirely re|moved his Oppre&s;&s;ion and Nau&s;ea. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

If the Di&s;charge by &s;pitting, and the Brightne&s;s and Quantity of Suppuration, have been in Proportion to the Number of Erup|tions; though the Conflict from the &s;econdary Fever, where the&s;e have been numerous, is often acute and high; and the Patient, who is in great Angui&s;h, is far from being out of Danger; yet Nature pretty generally proves &s;tronger than the Di&s;ea&s;e, in &s;uch Circum&s;tances. As the <HI>Elect. Catholicon</HI> is little u&s;ed, or made here, the lenitive Electuary of our Di&s;pen&s;atory may be &s;ub&s;tituted for it, or that of the <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Di&s;pen&s;atory, which was calculated particularly for Gly&s;ters. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> Body very open. For this Purpo&s;e, &agr; an Ounce of <HI>Catholicon</HI> &s;hould be added to the Gly&s;ter; or they might be &s;imply made of Whey, with Honey, Oil and Salt. &bgr; Give the Patient three times every Morning, at the Interval of two Hours between each, three Gla&s;&s;es of the Pti&s;an No. 32. &ggr; Purge him <HI>after</HI> two Days, with the Potion No. 23, but on that Day, he mu&s;t not take the Pti&s;an No. 32.</P>
<P>2. He mu&s;t, if the Di&s;temper be very violent, take a double Do&s;e of the Mixture No. 10.</P>
<P>3. The Patient &s;hould be taken out of Bed, and kept up in a Room well aired Day and Night, until the Fever has abated. Many Per&s;ons will probably be &s;urprized at this Advice; never|thele&s;s it is that which I have often experienced to be the mo&s;t ef|ficacious, and without which the others are ineffectual. They will &s;ay, how &s;hall the Patient &s;leep at this rate? To which it may be an&s;wered, Sleep is not nece&s;&s;ary, nay, it is hurtful in this State and Stage of the Di&s;ea&s;e. Be&s;ides, he is really unable to &s;leep; the continual Salivation prevents it, and it is very nece&s;&s;ary to keep up the Salivation; which is facilitated by often injecting
<PB N="113" REF="012243_0133_0F8A6B01CB551B98">
warm Water and Honey into his Throat. It is al&s;o of con&s;idera|ble Service to throw &s;ome up his No&s;trils, and often thus to clean&s;e the Scabs which form within them. A due Regard to the&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances not only contributes to le&s;&s;en the Patient's Unea&s;ine&s;s, but very effectually al&s;o to his Cure.</P>
<P>4. If the Face and Neck are greatly &s;welled, emolient Cata|pla&s;ms ought to be applied to the Soles of the Feet; and if the&s;e &s;hould have very little Effect, Sinapi&s;ms &s;hould be applied. The&s;e are a kind of Plai&s;ter or Application compo&s;ed of Yea&s;t, Mu&s;tard|flower, and &s;ome Vinegar. They &s;ometimes occa&s;ion &s;harp and almo&s;t burning Pain; but in Proportion to the Sharpne&s;s and In|crea&s;e of the&s;e Pains, the Head and Neck are remarkably relieved.</P>
<P>&sect; 215. The Eyelids are puffed up and &s;welled when the Di&s;|ea&s;e runs high, &s;o as to conceal the Eyes, which are clo&s;ed up fa&s;t for &s;everal Days. Nothing further &s;hould be attempted, with Re&s;pect to this Circum&s;tance, but the frequent moi&s;tening of them with a little warm Milk and Water. The Precautions which &s;ome take to &s;troke them with Saffron, a Gold Ducat, or Ro&s;e|water, are equally childi&s;h and in&s;ignificant. What chiefly con|duces to prevent the Redne&s;s or Inflammation of the Eyes after the Di&s;ea&s;e, and in general all its other bad Con&s;equences, is to be content for a con&s;iderable time, with a very moderate Quanti|ty of Food, and particularly to ab&s;tain from Fle&s;h and Wine. In the very bad Small-Pocks, and in little Children, the Eyes are clo&s;ed up from the Beginning of the Eruption.</P>
<P>&sect; 216. One extremely &s;erviceable A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and which has not been made u&s;e of for a long time pa&s;t, except as a Means to pre|&s;erve the Smoothne&s;s and Beauty of the Face; but yet which has the greate&s;t Tendency to pre&s;erve Life it&s;elf, is the Opening of the Pu&s;tules, not only upon the Face, but all over the Body. In the fir&s;t Place, by opening them, the Lodgment or Retention of <HI>Pus</HI> is prevented, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to prevent any Ero&s;ion, or eating down, from it; whence Scars, deep Pits, and other De|formities are obviated. Secondly, in giving a Vent to the Poi|&s;on, the Retreat of it into the Blood is cut off, which removes a principal Cau&s;e of the Danger of the Small-Pocks. Thirdly, the Skin is relaxed; the Tumour of the Face and Neck dimini&s;h in Proportion to that Relaxation; and thence the Return of the Blood from the Brain is facilitated, which mu&s;t prove a great Ad|vantage. The Pu&s;tules &s;hould be opened every where, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively as they ripen. The preci&s;e time of doing it is when they are en|tirely white; when they ju&s;t begin to turn but a very little yellow|i&s;h; and when the red Circle &s;urrounding them is quite pale. They &s;hould be opened with very fine &s;harp-pointed Sci&s;&s;ars; this does not give the Patient the lea&s;t Pain; and when a certain Num|ber of them are opened, a Spunge dipt in a little warm Water is to be repeatedly applied to &s;uck up and remove that <HI>Pus,</HI> which would &s;oon be dried up into Scabs. But as the Pu&s;tules, when emptied thus, &s;oon fill again, a Di&s;charge of this fre&s;h Matter

mu&s;t be obtained in the &s;ame Manner &s;ome Hours after; and this mu&s;t &s;ometimes be repeated five or even &s;ix times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. Such extraordinary Attention in this Point may probably be con|&s;idered as minute, and even trivial, by &s;ome; and is very unlike|ly to become a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Practice which I had heard of, and even &s;ugge&s;ted to my&s;elf, but ne|ver &s;een actually enterprized, &s;eems &s;o very rational as highly to de&s;erve a fair Trial in the confluent Degrees of the Small-Pocks [for in the very di&s;tinct it can &s;carcely be nece&s;&s;ary] wherein every probable A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be employed, and in which the mo&s;t potent Medicines are frequently un&s;ucce&s;sful. We have but too many Opportunities of trying it &s;ufficiently; and it certainly has a more pro|mi&s;&s;ing A&s;pect than a Practice &s;o highly recommended many Years ago, of cover|ing all the Pu&s;tules (which is &s;ometimes the whole Surface of the Patient) in Melilot, or &s;uppo&s;e any other &s;uppurating, Plai&s;ter; which mu&s;t effectually pre|vent all Per&s;piration, and greatly increa&s;e the Sorene&s;s, Pain, and Embarra&s;&s;|ment of the Patient, at the Height of the Di&s;ea&s;e. I can conceive but one bad Con&s;equence that might po&s;&s;ibly &s;ometimes re&s;ult from the former; but this (be|&s;ides the Means that may be u&s;ed to avert it) is rather remote, and &s;o uncertain, until the Trial is repeatedly made, that I think it ought not to be named, in Competition with the Benefits that may po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from it in &s;uch Ca&s;es, as &s;eem, otherwi&s;e, too generally irrecoverable. I own indeed, that Dr. GATTI gives his Suffrage &s;trongly again&s;t this Practice, in his late Tract concerning Ino|culation; RHAZES however u&s;ed and recommended it, which I recollect the more readily, from having lately read the learned Mr. CHANNING's clear and elegant <HI>Latin</HI> Tran&s;lation of him, from the original <HI>Arabic,</HI> which is printed in the oppo&s;ite Pages. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> general Practice: but I do again affirm it to be of much more Importance than many may imagine; and that as often as the Fever attending Suppuration is violent and menacing, a very general, exact and repeated opening, emptying and ab&s;orb|ing of the ripened Pu&s;tules, is a Remedy of the utmo&s;t Importance and Efficacy; as it removes two very con&s;iderable Cau&s;es of the Danger of this Di&s;ea&s;e, which are the Matter it&s;elf, and the great Ten&s;ion and Stiffne&s;s of the Skin.</P>
<P>&sect; 217. In the Treatment of this Di&s;ea&s;e, I have &s;aid nothing with Re&s;pect to Anodynes, or &s;uch Medicines as procure Sleep, which I am &s;en&s;ible are pretty generally employed in it; but which I &s;carcely ever direct in this violent Degree of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and the Danger of which Medicine in it I have demon&s;trated in the Letter to Baron HALLER, which I have already mentioned. For which Rea&s;on, wherever the Patient is not under the Care and Direc|tion of a Phy&s;ician, they &s;hould very carefully ab&s;tain from the U&s;e of Venice Treacle, Laudanum, <HI>Diacodium,</HI> that is, the Sy|rup of white Poppies, or even of the wild red Poppy; Syrup of Amber, Pills of Storax, of <HI>Cynoglo&s;&s;um</HI> or Hounds-tongue, and, in one Word, of every Medicine which produces Sleep. But &s;till more e&s;pecially &s;hould their U&s;e be entirely bani&s;hed, throughout the Duration of the &s;econdary Fever, when even natural Sleep it|&s;elf is dangerous. One Circum&s;tance in which their U&s;e may &s;ome|times be permitted, is in the Ca&s;e of weakly Children, or &s;uch as are liable to Convul&s;ions, where Eruption is effected not without Difficulty. But I mu&s;t again inculcate the greate&s;t Circum&s;pecti|on,
<PB N="115" REF="012243_0135_0F8A6B08790D0E88">
in the U&s;e of &s;uch Medicines, who&s;e Effects are fatal <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The U&s;e of Opiates in this Di&s;ea&s;e undoubtedly requires no &s;mall Con&s;idera|tion, the great SYDENHAM him&s;elf not &s;eeming always &s;ufficiently guarded in the Exhibition of them; as far as Experience &s;ince his Day has enabled Phy&s;i|cians to judge of this Matter. In general our Author's Limitations of them &s;eem very ju&s;t; though we have &s;een a few clear In&s;tances, in which a light Ra|ving, which evidently aro&s;e from Want of Sleep (joined to &s;ome Dread of the E|vent of the Di&s;ea&s;e by Inoculation) was happily removed, with every other con|&s;iderable Complaint, by a moderate Opiate. In &s;ore and fretful Children too, under a large or middling Eruption, as the time gained to Re&s;t is taken from Pain, and from wa&s;ting their Spirits in Crying and Clamour, I have &s;een Suppu|ration very benignly promoted by <HI>Diacodium.</HI> But in the <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> of the &s;econdary Fever in the confluent or coherent Pock, when there is a morbid Fulne&s;s, and Nature is &s;truggling to unload her&s;elf by &s;ome other Outlets than tho&s;e of the Skin, which now are totally ob&s;tructed (and which &s;eems the only Evacuation, that is not re&s;trained by Opiates) the giving and repeating them then, as has too often been practi&s;ed, &s;eems importantly erroneous: for I think Dr. SWAN has taken a judicious Liberty of di&s;&s;enting from the great Author he very ju&s;tly tran&s;lates, in forbidding an Opiate, if the Spitting abates, or grows &s;o tough and ropy, as to endanger Suffocation. As the Difference of our Oeconomy in the Admini&s;tration of Phy&s;ic from that in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> and Dr. TISSOT's ju&s;t Re|putation, may di&s;po&s;e many Country Practitioners to peru&s;e this Treati&s;e, I take the Liberty of referring &s;uch Readers for a Recollection of &s;ome of my Senti|ments on Opiates, (long before the Appearance of this Work in <HI>French</HI>) to the &s;econd Edition of the Analy&s;is from P. 94 to 97, <HI>&amp;c..</HI> And here I adopt with Plea&s;ure, the following judicious Remark of a learned and experienced Gentle|man, who has done me the Favour of attentively peru&s;ing my &s;econd Edition, in order to this third and more correct one.&mdash;
<Q>Opiates &s;hould never be given to procure Sleep, but Ea&s;e, in this Di&s;temper; and their Do&s;es mu&s;t be &s;mall, ju&s;t enough to take off the Sen&s;e of Sorene&s;s, and no more. <HI>Diacodium</HI> is the be&s;t of all, and never hinders the Expectoration.</Q>
&mdash;It may be added indeed, that Sleep will very often naturally attend the Ea&s;e procured by the Opiate (e&s;|pecially if long Wakefulne&s;s has preceded) but there will rarely, if ever, be any ill Con&s;equence, from that moderate Portion of Sleep, which this gentle tempe|rate Opiate, in a prudent Do&s;e, di&s;po&s;es to. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> when the Blood-ve&s;&s;els are turgid or full; whenever there is Inflamma|tion, Fever, a great Di&s;tention of the Skin; whenever the Patient raves, or complains of Heavine&s;s and Oppre&s;&s;ion; and when it is nece&s;&s;ary that the Belly &s;hould be open; the Urine plentifully di&s;|charged; and the Salivation be freely promoted.</P>
<P>&sect; 218. If Eruption &s;hould &s;uddenly retreat, or &s;trike in, heating, &s;oporific, &s;pirituous, and volatile Remedies &s;hould care|fully be avoided: but the Patient may drink plentifully of the In|fu&s;ion No. 12 pretty hot, and &s;hould be bli&s;tered on the fle&s;hy Part of the Legs. This is a very embarra&s;&s;ing and difficult Ca&s;e, and the different Circum&s;tances attending it may require different Means and Applications, the Detail and Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which are beyond my Plan here. Sometimes a &s;ingle Bleeding has effectual|ly recalled Eruption at once.</P>
<P>&sect; 219. The only certain Method of &s;urmounting all the Dan|ger of this Malady, is to inoculate. But this mo&s;t &s;alutary Me|thod, which ought to be regarded as a particular and gracious Di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence, can &s;carcely be attainable by, or &s;er|viceable to, the Bulk of the People; except in the&s;e Countries,

In tho&s;e where as yet there are none, the only Re&s;ource that is left for Children who cannot be inoculated at home, is to di&s;po&s;e them happily for the Di&s;temper, by a &s;imple ea&s;y Preparation.</P>
<P>&sect; 220. This Preparation con&s;i&s;ts, upon the whole, in removing all Want of, and all Ob&s;tructions to, the Health of the Per&s;on &s;ubject to this Di&s;ea&s;e, if he have any &s;uch; and in bringing him into a mild and healthy, but not into a very robu&s;t and vigorous State; as this Di&s;temper is often exceedingly violent in the la&s;t.</P>
<P>It is evident, that &s;ince the Defects of Health are very different in different Bodies, the Preparations of them mu&s;t as often vary; and that a Child &s;ubject to &s;ome habitual Di&s;order, cannot be pre|pared in the &s;ame Method with another who has a very oppo&s;ite one. The Detail and Di&s;tinctions which are nece&s;&s;ary on this im|portant Head, would be improper here, whether it might be ow|ing to their unavoidable Length; or to the Impo&s;&s;ibility of giv|ing Per&s;ons, who are not Phy&s;icians, &s;ufficient Knowledge and Information, to qualify them for determining on, and preferring, the mo&s;t proper Preparation in various Ca&s;es. Neverthele&s;s I will point out &s;ome &s;uch as may be very likely to agree, pretty gene|rally, with Re&s;pect to &s;trong and healthy Children <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Subject of this Section flows from the Combination of an excellent Under&s;tanding with great Experience, mature Reflection, and real Probity; and fundamentally expo&s;es both the Ab&s;urdity of &s;uch as univer&s;ally decry any Pre|paration of any Subject previous to Inoculation, (which is &s;aid to be the Practice of a pre&s;ent very popular Inoculator in <HI>Paris,</HI>) and the oppo&s;ite Ab&s;urdity of giving one and the very &s;ame Preparation to all Subjects, without Di&s;tinction; tho' this was avowed to have been &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> &s;ome Years &s;ince; which the Reader may &s;ee Analy&s;. Ed. 2, from P. 329 to 331, and the Note there. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Step then is an Abatement of their u&s;ual Quantity of Food. Children commonly eat too much. Their Limitation &s;hould be in Proportion to their Size and Growth, wherever we can exactly a&s;certain them: but with Regard to all, or to much the greater Number of them, we may be allowed to make their Supper very light and very &s;mall.</P>
<P>Their &s;econd Advantage will con&s;i&s;t in the Choice of their Food. This Circum&s;tance is le&s;s within the Attainment of, and indeed le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for, the common People, who are of cour&s;e limited to a very few, than to the Rich, who have Room to make great Retrenchments on this Account. The Diet of Country People be|ing of the &s;imple&s;t Kind, and almo&s;t &s;olely con&s;i&s;ting of Vegeta|bles and of Milk-meats, is the mo&s;t proper Diet towards prepar|ing for this Di&s;ea&s;e. For this Rea&s;on, &s;uch Per&s;ons have little more to attend to in this Re&s;pect, but that &s;uch Aliments be &s;ound
<PB N="117" REF="012243_0137_0F8A6B0949B46FA0">
and good in their Kind; that their Bread be well baked; their Puls dre&s;&s;ed without Bacon, or rancid &s;trong Fat of any Sort; that their Fruits &s;hould be well ripened; that their Children &s;hould have no Cakes or Tarts, [But &s;ee Note * P. 20.] and but little Chee&s;e. The&s;e &s;imple Regulations may be &s;ufficient, with Regard to this Article of their Preparation.</P>
<P>Some Judgment may be formed of the good Con&s;equences of their Care in the&s;e two Points, concerning the Quantity and Qua|lity of the Children's Diet, by the moderate Shrinking of their Bellies; as they will be rendered more lively and active by this Alteration in their living; and yet, notwith&s;tanding a little le&s;s Ruddine&s;s in their Complexion, and &s;ome Abatement of their common Plight of Body, their Countenances, upon the whole, will &s;eem improved.</P>
<P>The third Article I would recommend, is to bathe their Legs now and then in warm Water, before they go to Bed. This pro|motes Per&s;piration, cools, dilutes the Blood, and allays the Sharp|ne&s;s of it, as often as it is properly timed.</P>
<P>The fourth Precaution is the frequent u&s;e of very clear Whey. This agreeable Remedy, which con&s;i&s;ts of the Juices of Herbs filtred through and concocted, or as it were, &s;weetened by the Or|gans of a healthy Animal, an&s;wers every vi&s;ible Indication: (I am &s;till &s;peaking here of &s;ound and hearty Children.) It imparts a Flexibility or Souplene&s;s to the Ve&s;&s;els; it abates the Den&s;ity, the heavy Con&s;i&s;tence and Thickne&s;s of the Blood; which being augmented by the Action of the poi&s;onous Cau&s;e of the Small-Pocks, would degenerate into a mo&s;t dangerous inflammatory <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">There may certainly be an inflammatory Acrimony or Thinne&s;s, as well as Thickne&s;s, of the Blood; and many medical Readers may think a morbid Fu&s;i|on of the red Globules to be a more frequent Effect of this Contagion, than an increa&s;ed Vi&s;cidity, or Den&s;ity, of them. See Analy&s;. Ed. 2d. P. 75 to 83. But this Tran&s;lation, conforming to the Spirit of its Original, admits very little Theory, and &s;till le&s;s Controver&s;y, into its Plan. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> Vi&s;cidity or Thickne&s;s. It removes all Ob&s;tructions in the <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> or Bowels of the lower Cavity, the Belly. It opens the Pa&s;&s;ages which &s;train off the Bile; &s;heaths, or blunts, its Sharpne&s;s, gives it a proper Fluidity, prevents its Putridity, and &s;weetens whate|ver exce&s;&s;ive Acrimony may re&s;ide throughout the Ma&s;s of Hu|mours. It likewi&s;e promotes Stools, Urine, and Per&s;piration; and, in a Word, it communicates the mo&s;t favorable Di&s;po&s;ition to the Body, not to be too violently impre&s;&s;ed and agitated by the Operation of an inflammatory Poi&s;on: And with Regard to &s;uch Children as I have mentioned, for tho&s;e who are either &s;anguine or bilious, it is beyond all Contradiction, the mo&s;t effectual pre|paratory Drink, and the mo&s;t proper to make them amends for the Want of Inoculation.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that it may al&s;o be u&s;ed to great Advantage, during the Cour&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e: but I mu&s;t further
<PB N="118" REF="012243_0138_0F8A6B0A5BCE6498">
ob&s;erve, that however &s;alutary it is, in the Ca&s;es for which I have directed it, there are many others in which it would be hurtful. It would be extremely pernicious to order it to weak, langui&s;hing, &s;chirrous, pale Children, &s;ubject to Vomitings, Purgings, Acidi|ties, and to all Di&s;ea&s;es which prove their Bowels to be weak, their Humours to be &s;harp: &s;o that People mu&s;t be very cautious not to regard it as an univer&s;al and infallible Remedy, towards preparing for the Small-Pocks. Tho&s;e to whom it is advi&s;ed, may take a few Gla&s;&s;es every Morning, and even drink it daily, for their common Drink; they may al&s;o &s;up it with Bread for Break|fa&s;t, for Supper, and indeed at any time.</P>
<P>If Country People will pur&s;ue the&s;e Directions, which are very ea&s;y to ob&s;erve and to comprehend, whenever the Small-Pocks rages, I am per&s;uaded it mu&s;t le&s;&s;en the Mortality attending it. Some will certainly experience the Benefit of them; &s;uch I mean as are very &s;en&s;ible, and di&s;creet, and &s;trongly influenced by the true&s;t Love of their Children. Others there are, alas! who are too &s;tupid to di&s;cern the Advantage of them, and too unnatural to take any ju&s;t Care of their Families.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIV. Of the Mea&s;les.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 221. THE Mea&s;les, to which the human Species are as generally liable, as to the Small-Pocks, is a Di&s;temper con&s;iderably related to it; though, generally &s;peaking, it is le&s;s fatal; not|with&s;tanding which, it is not a little de&s;tructive in &s;ome Coun|tries.

<P>It happens now and then that the Small-Pocks and the Mea&s;les rage at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame Place; though I have more frequently ob&s;erved, that each of them was epidemical in different Years. Sometimes it al&s;o happens that both the&s;e Di&s;|ea&s;es are combined at once in the &s;ame Per&s;on; and that one &s;u|pervenes before the other has fini&s;hed its Cour&s;e, which makes the Ca&s;e very perilous.</P>

In &s;ome Con&s;titutions the Mea&s;les gives Notice of its Approach, many Days before its evident Inva&s;ion, by a &s;mall, frequent; and dry Cough, without any other &s;en&s;ible Complaint; though more frequently by a general Unea&s;ine&s;s; by Succe&s;&s;ions of Shivering and of Heat; by a &s;evere Head-ach in grown Per|&s;ons;
<PB N="119" REF="012243_0139_0F8A6B0C5697C488">
a Heavine&s;s in Children; a con&s;iderable Complaint of the Throat; and, by what particularly characterizes this Di&s;temper, an Inflammation and a con&s;iderable Heat in the Eyes, attended with a Swelling of the Eye-lids, with a Defluxion of &s;harp Tears, and &s;o acute a Sen&s;ation, or Feeling of the Eyes, that they can|not bear the Light; by very frequent Sneezings and a Dripping from the No&s;e of the &s;ame Humour with that, which trickles from the Eyes.</P>
<P>The Heat and the Fever increa&s;e with Rapidity; the Patient is afflicted with a Cough, a Stuffing, with Angui&s;h, and continual Reachings to vomit; with violent Pains in the Loins; and &s;ome|times with a Loo&s;ene&s;s, under which Circum&s;tance he is le&s;s per|&s;ecuted with Vomiting. At other times, and in other Subjects, Sweating chiefly prevails, though in le&s;s Abundance than in the Small-Pocks. The Tongue is foul and white; the Thir&s;t is of|ten very high; and the Symptoms are generally more violent than in the mild Small-Pocks.</P>
<P>At length, on the fourth or fifth Day, and &s;ometimes about the End of the third, a &s;udden Eruption appears, and in a very great Quantity, e&s;pecially about the Face; which in a few Hours is covered with Spots, each of which re&s;embles a Flea-bite; many of them &s;oon joining form red Streaks or Suffu&s;ions larger or &s;maller, which inflame the Skin, and produce a very perceivable Swelling of the Face; whence the very Eyes are &s;ometimes clo&s;|ed. Each &s;mall Spot or Suffu&s;ion is rai&s;ed a little above the Sur|face, e&s;pecially in the Face, where they are manife&s;t both to the Sight and the Touch. In the other Parts of the Body, this E|levation or Ri&s;ing is &s;carcely perceivable by any Circum&s;tance, but the Roughne&s;s of the Skin.</P>
<P>The Eruption, having fir&s;t appeared in the Face, is afterwards extended to the Brea&s;t, the Back, the Arms, the Thighs and Legs. It generally &s;preads very plentifully over the Brea&s;t and the Back, and &s;ometimes red Suffu&s;ions are found upon the Brea&s;t, before any Eruption has appeared in the Face.</P>
<P>The Patient is often relieved, as in the Small-Pocks, by plenti|ful Di&s;charges of Blood from the No&s;e, which carry off the Com|plaints of the Head, of the Eyes, and of the Throat.</P>
<P>Whenever this Di&s;temper appears in its milde&s;t Character, al|mo&s;t every Symptom abates after Eruption, as it happens in the Small-Pocks; though, in general, the Change for the better is not as thoroughly perceivable, as it is in the Small-Pocks. It is certain the Reachings and Vomitings cea&s;e almo&s;t entirely; but the Fever, the Cough, the Head-ach continue; and I have &s;ome|times ob&s;erved that a bilious Vomiting, a Day or two after the E|ruption, proved a more con&s;iderable Relief to the Patient than the Eruption had proved. On the third or fourth Day of the E|ruption, the Redne&s;s dimini&s;hes; the Spots, or very &s;mall Pu&s;tu|les, dry up and fall off in very little branny Scales; the Cuticle, or &s;uperficial Skin al&s;o &s;hrivels off, and is replaced by one &s;ucceed|ing beneath it. On the 9th Day, when the Progre&s;s of the Mala|dy
<PB N="120" REF="012243_0140_0F8A6B0D63F1FB08">
has been &s;peedy, and on the eleventh, when it has been very &s;low, no Trace of the Redne&s;s is to be found; and the Surface immediately re&s;umes its u&s;ual Appearance.</P>
<P>&sect; 223. Notwith&s;tanding all which the Patient is not &s;afe, ex|cept, during the Cour&s;e of the Di&s;temper, or immediately after it, he has had &s;ome con&s;iderable Evacuation; &s;uch as the Vomit|ing I have ju&s;t mentioned; or a bilious Loo&s;ene&s;s; or con&s;idera|ble Di&s;charges by Urine; or very plentiful Sweating. For when any of the&s;e Evacuations &s;upervenes, the Fever vani&s;hes; the Pa|tient re&s;umes his Strength, and perfectly recovers. It happens &s;ometimes too, and even without any of the&s;e perceivable Di&s;|charges, that in&s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration expels the Relics of the poi&s;o|nous Cau&s;e of this Di&s;ea&s;e, and the Patient recovers his Health. Yet it occurs too often, that this Venom not having been entirely expelled (or its internal Effects not having been thoroughly effa|ced) it is repelled upon the Lungs, where it produces a &s;light In|flammation. In Con&s;equence of this the Oppre&s;&s;ion, the Cough, the Angui&s;h and Fever return, and the Patient's Situation be|comes very dangerous. This Outrage is frequently le&s;s vehement, but it proves tedious and chronical, leaving a very ob&s;tinate Cough behind it, with many Re&s;emblances of the Whooping-Cough. In 1758 there was a very epidemic &s;tate of the Mea&s;les at <HI>Lau&s;anne,</HI> which affected great Numbers: Almo&s;t all who had it, and who were not very carefully and judiciou&s;ly attended, were &s;eized in Con&s;equence of it with that Cough, which proved very violent and ob&s;tinate.</P>
<P>&sect; 224. However, notwith&s;tanding this be the frequent Progre&s;s and Con&s;equence of this Di&s;ea&s;e, when left entirely to it&s;elf, or erroneou&s;ly treated, and more particularly when treated with a hot Regimen; yet when proper Care was taken to moderate the Fever at the Beginning, to dilute, and to keep up the Evacua|tions, &s;uch unhappy Con&s;equences have been very rare.</P>
<P>&sect; 225. The proper Method of conducting this Di&s;temper is much the &s;ame with that of the Small-Pocks.</P>
<P>1, If the Fever be high, the Pul&s;e hard, the Load and Op|pre&s;&s;ion heavy, and all the Symptoms violent, the Patient mu&s;t be bled once or twice.</P>
<P>2, His Legs mu&s;t be bathed, and he mu&s;t take &s;ome Gly&s;ters: the Vehemence of the Symptoms mu&s;t regulate the Number of each.</P>
<P>3, The Pti&s;ans No. 3 or 4 mu&s;t be taken, or a Tea of Elder and Lime-tree flowers, to which a fifth Part Milk may be added.</P>
<P>4, The Vapour, the Steam of warm Water &s;hould al&s;o be em|ployed, as very conducive to a&s;&s;wage the Cough, the Sorene&s;s of the Throat, and the Oppre&s;&s;ion the Patient labours under.</P>
<P>5, As &s;oon as the Efflore&s;cence, the Redne&s;s, becomes pale, the Patient is to be purged with the Draught No. 23.</P>
<P>6, He is &s;till to be kept &s;trictly to his Regimen, for two Days
<PB N="121" REF="012243_0141_0F8A6B0E1F8F4CC8">
after this Purge; after which he is to be put upon the Diet of tho&s;e who are in a State of Recovery.</P>
<P>7, If during the Eruption &s;uch Symptoms &s;upervene as occur [at the &s;ame Term] in the Small-Pocks, they are to be treated in the Manner already directed there.</P>
<P>&sect; 226. Whenever this Method has not been ob&s;erved, and the Accidents de&s;cribed &sect; 223 &s;upervene, the Di&s;temper mu&s;t be treated like an Inflammation in its fir&s;t State, and all mu&s;t be done as di|rected &sect; 225. If the Di&s;ea&s;e is not vehement, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Our Author very prudently limits this Di&s;charge, and the Repetition of it, in this Di&s;ea&s;e (&sect; 225) as an erroneous Exce&s;s of it has &s;ometimes prevailed. I have &s;een a very epidemical Sea&s;on of the Mea&s;les, where Bleeding was not indi|cated in one third of the infected. And yet I have known &s;uch an Abu&s;e of Bleeding in it, that being repeated more than once in a Ca&s;e before Eruption (the Mea&s;les probably not being &s;u&s;pected) the Eruption was retarded &s;everal Days; and the Patient, a young Lady of Condition, remained exceeding low, faint, and &s;icki&s;h; 'till after recruiting a very little, the Mea&s;les appeared, and &s;he reco|vered. In a Youth of a lax Fibre, where the Mea&s;les had appeared, a &s;eventh or eighth Bleeding was ordered on a Stitch in the Side, &s;upervening from their too early Di&s;appearance, and the Ca&s;e &s;eemed very doubtful. But Nature conti|nued very ob&s;tinately favourable in this Youth, who at length, though very &s;lowly, recovered. His Circulation remained &s;o languid, his Strength, with his Juices, &s;o exhau&s;ted, that he was many Weeks before he could &s;it upright in a Chair; being obliged to make U&s;e of a Cord depending from the Ceiling, to rai&s;e him&s;elf erectly in his Seat. The&s;e certain In&s;tances of the Abu&s;e of Bleeding in this Di&s;ea&s;e, are neverthele&s;s by no Means intended to prohibit the U&s;e of it, when clearly indicated, as it often is. The medical Reader may &s;ee Dr. MEAD's rational Sentiments on this Head, in his Book <HI>De variol. et morbil.</HI> from P. 94 to 95.</NOTE> Bleeding may be omitted. If it is of &s;ome &s;tanding in gro&s;s Children, loaded with Humours, inactive, and pale, we mu&s;t add to the Medicines al|ready pre&s;cribed the Potion No. 8, and Bli&s;ters to the Legs.</P>
<P>&sect; 227. It often happens from the Di&s;tance of proper Advice, that the Relics, the Dregs as it were, of the Di&s;ea&s;e have been too little regarded, e&s;pecially the Cough; in which Circum&s;tance it forms a real Suppuration in the Lungs, attended with a &s;low Fever. I have &s;een many Children in Country Villages de&s;troyed by this Neglect. Their Ca&s;e is then of the &s;ame Nature with that de&s;cribed &sect; 68 and 82, and terminates in the &s;ame Manner in a Loo&s;ene&s;s, (attended with very little Pain) and &s;ometimes a very foetid one, which carries off the Patient. In &s;uch Ca&s;es we mu&s;t recur to the Remedies pre&s;cribed &sect; 74, Article 3, 4, 5; to the Powder No. 14; and to Milk and Exerci&s;e. But it is &s;o very dif|ficult to make Children take the Powder, that it may be &s;ome|times nece&s;&s;ary to tru&s;t to the Milk without it, which I have of|ten &s;een in &s;uch Situations accompli&s;h a very difficult Cure. I mu&s;t advi&s;e the Reader at the &s;ame time, that it has not &s;o com|pleat an Effect, as when it is taken &s;olely, unjoined by any other Aliment; and that it is of the la&s;t Importance not to join it with any, which has the lea&s;t Acidity or Sharpne&s;s. Per&s;ons in ea&s;y
<PB N="122" REF="012243_0142_0F8A6B0E9E622ED8">
Circum&s;tances may &s;ucce&s;sfully take, at the &s;ame time, <HI>Pfeffer.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Water will be no bad Sub&s;titute for any of the&s;e, in &s;uch Ca&s;es. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> Seltzer, Peter&s;tal,</HI> or &s;ome other light Waters, which are but mo|derately loaded with mineral Ingredients. The&s;e are al&s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully employed in all the Ca&s;es, in which the Cure I have men|tioned is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>&sect; 228. Sometimes there remains, after the Cour&s;e of the Mea&s;les, a &s;trong dry Cough, with great Heat in the Brea&s;t, and throughout the whole Body, with Thir&s;t, an exce&s;&s;ive Dryne&s;s of the Tongue, and of the whole Surface of the Body. I have cured Per&s;ons thus indi&s;po&s;ed after this Di&s;temper, by making them breathe in the Vapour of warm Water; by the repeated U&s;e of warm Baths; and by allowing them to take nothing for &s;everal Days but Water and Milk.</P>
<P>Before I take leave of this Subject, I a&s;&s;ure the Reader again, that the contagious Cau&s;e of the Mea&s;les is of an extremely &s;harp and acrid Nature. It appears to have &s;ome Re&s;emblance to the bilious Humour, which produces the <HI>Eri&s;ipelas,</HI> or St. Anthony's Fire; and thence it demands our particular Attention and Vigi|lance; without which very trouble&s;ome and dangerous Con&s;e|quences may be apprehended. I have &s;een, not long &s;ince, a young Girl, who was in a very languid State after the Mea&s;les, which &s;he had undergone three Years before: It was at length attended with an Ulceration in her Neck, which was cured, and her Health finally re&s;tored by <HI>Sar&s;aparilla</HI> with Milk and Water.</P>
<P>&sect; 229. The Mea&s;les have been communicated by <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The only Account I have read of this Practice, is in the learned Dr. HOME's <HI>Medical Facts and Experiments,</HI> publi&s;hed in 1759, which admits, that but nine out of fifteen of the Subjects of this Practice took. Cotton dipt in the Blood of a Patient in the Mea&s;les was in&s;erted into the Arms of twelve; and three re|ceived the Cotton into their No&s;trils, after the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Manner of infu&s;ing the Small-Pocks; but of the&s;e la&s;t not one took, and one of tho&s;e who had taken, had the Mea&s;les again two Months after. I think the &s;harp hot Lymph di&s;til|ling from the inflamed Eyes of Per&s;ons in this Di&s;ea&s;e, a likelier Vehicle to com|municate it than the Blood, e&s;pecially the dry Blood, which was &s;ometimes tried; &s;ince the human <HI>Serum</HI> &s;eems the Fluid more particularly affected by it; and this mu&s;t have been evaporated, when the Blood grew dry. A few practical Stric|tures on this Work, and particularly on this Practice de&s;cribed in it, appeared in the Monthly Review, Vol. XXI. P. 68 to 75. One Dr. <HI>Cooke,</HI> who treats the Public &s;ometimes, with a few medical Crumbs in the News-Papers, has a&s;&s;umed (without the lea&s;t Reference or Acknowledgement) this Notion of inoculating the Mea&s;les from the watery Di&s;charge by the Eyes in it. Of this however, of whatever Con&s;equence it may prove, I was certainly the fir&s;t Propo&s;er, though I have never made any Experiment of its Event; but only mentioned it to my Lord HOME, who a&s;&s;ured me he would communicate it to Dr. HOME. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> Inoculation in &s;ome Countries, where it is of a very malignant Di&s;po&s;ition; and that Method might al&s;o be very advantageous in this Di&s;ea&s;e. But what we have already ob&s;erved, with Re&s;pect to the Inocula|tion of the Small-Pocks, <HI>viz.</HI> That it cannot be extended to the general Benefit of the People, without the Foundation of Ho&s;pi|tals for that very Purpo&s;e, is equally applicable to the Inoculation of the Mea&s;les.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XV. Of the ardent or burning Fever.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 230. THE much greater Number of the Di&s;ea&s;es I have hitherto con&s;idered, re&s;ult from an Inflammation of the Blood, com|bined with the particular Inflammation of &s;ome Part; or occa|&s;ioned by &s;ome Contagion or Poi&s;on, which mu&s;t be evacuated. But when the Blood is &s;olely and &s;trongly inflamed, without an Attack on any particular Part, this Fever, which we term hot or burning, is the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>&sect; 231. The Signs which make it evident are, a Hardne&s;s and Fulne&s;s of the Pul&s;e in a higher Degree than happens in any other Malady; an exce&s;&s;ive Heat; great Thir&s;t; with an extraordinary Dryne&s;s of the Eyes, No&s;trils, Lips, of the Tongue, and of the Throat; a violent Head-ach; and &s;ometimes a Raving at the Height of the Paroxy&s;m, or Increa&s;e of the Fever, which ri&s;es con&s;iderably every Evening. The Re&s;piration is al&s;o &s;omewhat oppre&s;&s;ed, but e&s;pecially at the Return of this Paroxy&s;m, with a Cough now and then: though without any Pain in the Brea&s;t, and without any Expectoration, or coughing up. The Body is co&s;tive; the Urine very high coloured, hot, and in a &s;mall Quan|tity, The Sick are al&s;o liable to &s;tart &s;ometimes, but e&s;pecially when they &s;eem to &s;leep; for they have little &s;ound refre&s;hing Sleep, but rather a kind of Drow&s;ine&s;s, that makes them very little attentive to, or &s;en&s;ible of, whatever happens about them, or even of their own Condition. They have &s;ometimes a little Sweat or Moi&s;ture; though commonly a very dry Skin; they are manife&s;tly weak, and have either little or no Smell or Ta&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect; 232. This Di&s;ea&s;e, like all other inflammatory ones, is pro|duced by the Cau&s;es which thicken the Blood, and increa&s;e its Motion; &s;uch as exce&s;&s;ive Labour, violent Heat, Want of Sleep, the Abu&s;e of Wine or other &s;trong Liquors; the long Continu|ance of a dry Con&s;titution of the Air, Exce&s;s of every Kind, and heating inflaming Food.</P>
<P>&sect; 233. The Patient, under the&s;e Circum&s;tances, ought, 1, immediately to be put upon a Regimen; to have the Food al|lowed him given only every eight Hours, and, in &s;ome Ca&s;es only twice a Day: and indeed, when the Attack is extremely violent, Nouri&s;hment may be wholly omitted.</P>
<P>2, Bleeding &s;hould be performed and repeated, 'till the Hard|ne&s;s of the Pul&s;e is &s;en&s;ibly abated. The fir&s;t Di&s;charge &s;hould be con&s;iderable, the &s;econd &s;hould be made four Hours after. If
<PB N="124" REF="012243_0144_0F8A6B10100A4320">
the Pul&s;e is &s;oftened by the fir&s;t, the &s;econd may be &s;u&s;pended, and not repeated before it becomes &s;ufficiently hard again to make us apprehen&s;ive of Danger; but &s;hould it continue &s;trong and hard, the Bleeding may be repeated on the &s;ame Day to a third Time, which often happens to be the utmo&s;t Repetition that is nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>3, The Gly&s;ter No. 5, &s;hould be given twice, or even thrice, daily.</P>
<P>4, His Legs are to be bathed twice a Day in warm Water: his Hands may be bathed in the &s;ame Water. Linen or Flanel Cloths dipt in warm Water may be applied over the Brea&s;t, and upon the Belly; and he &s;hould regularly drink the Almond Milk No. 4 and the Pti&s;an No. 7. The poore&s;t Patients may content them|&s;elves with the la&s;t, but &s;hould drink very plentifully of it; and after the Bleeding properly repeated, fre&s;h Air and the plentiful Continuance of &s;mall diluting Liquors generally e&s;tabli&s;h the Health of the Patient.</P>
<P>5, If, notwith&s;tanding the repeated Bleedings, the Fever &s;till rages highly, it may be le&s;&s;ened by giving a Spoonful of the Po|tion No. 10 every Hour 'till it abates; and afterwards every three Hours, untill it becomes very moderate.</P>
<P>&sect; 234. Haemorrhages, or Bleedings from the No&s;e frequently occur in this Fever, greatly to the Relief and Security of the Patient.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Appearances of Amendment are a &s;oftening of the Pul&s;e, (which however does not wholly lo&s;e all its Hardne&s;s, before the Di&s;ea&s;e entirely terminates) a &s;en&s;ible Abatement of the Head-ach; a greater Quantity of Urine, and that le&s;s high coloured; and a manife&s;tly approaching Moi&s;ture of the Tongue. The&s;e favour|able Signs keep increa&s;ing in their Degree, and there frequently en|&s;ue, between the ninth and the fourteenth Day, and often after a Flurry of &s;ome Hours Continuance, very large Evacuations by Stool; a great Quantity of Urine, which lets fall a palely reddi&s;h Sediment, the Urine above it being very clear, and of a natural Colour; and the&s;e accompanied with Sweats in a le&s;s or greater Quantity. At the &s;ame Time the No&s;trils and the Mouth grow moi&s;t: the brown and dry Cru&s;t which covered the Tongue, and which was hitherto in&s;eparable from it, peels off of it&s;elf; the Thir&s;t is dimini&s;hed; the Clearne&s;s of the Faculties ri&s;es; the Drow&s;ine&s;s goes off, it is &s;ucceeded by comfortable Sleep, and the natural Strength is re&s;tored. When Things are evidently in this Way, the Patient &s;hould take the Potion No. 23, and be put upon the Regimen of tho&s;e who are in a State of Recovery. It &s;hould be repeated at the End of eight or ten Days. Some Patients have perfectly recovered from this Fever, without the lea&s;t Sediment jn their Urine.</P>
<P>&sect; 235. The augmenting Danger of this Fever may be di&s;cern|ed, from the continued Hardne&s;s of the Pul&s;e, though with an Abatement of its Strength; if the Brain becomes more confu&s;ed;
<PB N="125" REF="012243_0145_0F8A6B10EAC1EC40">
the Breathing more difficult; if the Eyes, No&s;e, Lips, and Tongue become &s;till more dry, and the Voice more altered. If to the&s;e Symptoms there be al&s;o added a Swelling of the Belly; a Diminution of the Quantity of Urine; a con&s;tant Raving; great Anxiety, and a certain Wildne&s;s of the Eyes, the Ca&s;e is in a manner de&s;perate; and the Patient cannot &s;urvive many Hours. The Hands and Fingers at this Period are ince&s;&s;antly in Motion, as if feeling for &s;omething upon the Bed-cloths, which is com|monly termed, their hunting for Flies.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVI. Of putrid Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 236. HAVING treated of &s;uch feveri&s;h Di&s;tempers as ari&s;e from an Inflammation of the Blood, I &s;hall here treat of tho&s;e produced by corrupt Humours, which &s;tagnate in the Stomach, the Guts, or other Bowels of the lower Cavity, the Belly; or which have already pa&s;&s;ed from them into the Blood. The&s;e are called putrid Fevers, or &s;ometimes bilious Fevers, when a certain Degeneracy or Corruption of the Bile &s;eems chiefly to prevail in the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; 237. This Di&s;temper frequently gives Notice of its Approach, &s;everal Days before its manife&s;t Attack; by a great Dejection, a Heavine&s;s of the Head; Pains of the Loins and Knees; a Foul|ne&s;s of the Mouth in the Morning; little Appetite; broken Slum|ber; and &s;ometimes by an exce&s;&s;ive Head-ach for many Days, without any other Symptom. After this, or the&s;e Di&s;orders, a Shivering comes on, followed by a &s;harp and dry Heat: the Pul&s;e, which was &s;mall and quick during the Shivering, is rai&s;ed during the Heat, and is often very &s;trong, though it is not attended with the &s;ame Hardne&s;s, as in the preceding Fever; except the putrid Fever be combined with an inflammatory one, which it &s;ometimes is. During this Time, that is the Duration of the Heat, the Head-ach is commonly extremely violent; the Patient is almo&s;t con&s;tantly affected with Loathings, and &s;ometimes even with Vo|miting; with Thir&s;t, di&s;agreeable Ri&s;ings, a Bitterne&s;s in the Mouth; and very little Urine. This Heat continues for many Hours, frequently the whole Night; it abates a little in the Morn|ing, and the Pul&s;e, though always feveri&s;h, is then &s;omething le&s;s &s;o, while the Patient &s;uffers le&s;s, though &s;till greatly dejected.</P>
<P>The Tongue is white and furred, the Teeth are foul, and the Breath &s;mells very di&s;agreeably. The Colour, Quantity and Con&s;i&s;tence of the Urine, are very various and changeable. Some
<PB N="126" REF="012243_0146_0F8DFBD126583D08">
Patients are co&s;tive, others frequently have &s;mall Stools, without the lea&s;t Relief accruing from them. The Skin is &s;ometimes dry, and at other times there is &s;ome &s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration, but without any Benefit attending it. The Fever augments every Day, and frequently at unexpected irregular Periods. Be&s;ides that <HI>great</HI> Pa|roxy&s;m or Increa&s;e, which is perceivable in all the Subjects of this Fever, &s;ome have al&s;o other <HI>le&s;s</HI> intervening ones.</P>
<P>&sect; 238. When the Di&s;ea&s;e is left to it&s;elf, or injudiciou&s;ly treat|ed; or when it proves more powerful than the Remedies again&s;t it, which is by no Means &s;eldom the Ca&s;e, the Aggravations of it be|come longer, more frequent and irregular. There is &s;carcely an Interval of Ea&s;e. The Patient's Belly is &s;welled out like a Foot|ball: a <HI>Delirium</HI> or Raving comes on; he proves in&s;en&s;ible of his own Evacuations, which come away involuntarily; he rejects A&s;|&s;i&s;tance, and keeps muttering continually, with a quick, &s;mall, ir|regular Pul&s;e. Sometimes little Spots of a brown, or of a livid Colour appear on the Surface, but particularly about the Neck, Back and Brea&s;t. All the Di&s;charges from his Body have a mo&s;t foetid Smell: convul&s;ive Motions al&s;o &s;upervene, e&s;pecially in the Face; he lies down only on his Back, &s;inks down in&s;en&s;ibly to|wards the Feet of the Bed, and picks about, as if catching Flies; his Pul&s;e becomes &s;o quick and &s;o &s;mall, that it cannot be perceived without Difficulty, and cannot be counted. His Angui&s;h &s;eems inexpre&s;&s;ible: His Sweats &s;tream down from Agony: his Brea&s;t &s;wells out as if di&s;tended by Fullne&s;s, and he dies mi&s;erably.</P>
<P>&sect; 239. When this Di&s;temper is le&s;s violent, or more judiciou&s;ly treated, and the Medicines &s;ucceed well, it continues for &s;ome Days in the State de&s;cribed &sect; 237, without growing wor&s;e, though without abating, None of the&s;e Symptoms however appear, de|&s;cribed &sect; 238; but, on the contrary, all the Symptoms become milder, the Paroxy&s;ms, or Aggravations, are &s;horter and le&s;s violent, the Head-ach more &s;upportable; the Di&s;charges by Stool are le&s;s frequent, but more at once, and attended with Relief to the Patient. The Quantity of Urine is very con&s;iderable, though it varies at different Times in Colour and Con&s;i&s;tence, as before. The Patient &s;oon begins to get a little Sleep, and grows more com|po&s;ed and ea&s;y. The Tongue di&s;engages it&s;elf from its Filth and Furrine&s;s, and Health gradually, yet daily, advances.</P>
<P>&sect; 240. This Fever &s;eems to have no critical Time, either for its Termination in Recovery, or in Death. When it is very violent, or very badly conducted, it proves &s;ometimes fatal on the ninth Day. Per&s;ons often die of it from the eighteenth to the twentieth; &s;ometimes only about the fortieth; after having been alternately better and wor&s;e.</P>
<P>When it happens but in a light Degree, it is &s;ometimes cured within a few Days, after the earlie&s;t Evacuations. When it is of a very different Character, &s;ome Patients are not out of Danger before the End of &s;ix Weeks, and even &s;till later. Neverthele&s;s it is certain that the&s;e Fevers, extended to this Length of Duration,
<PB N="127" REF="012243_0147_0F8DFBD5B1DBBF88">
often depend in a great Mea&s;ure on the Manner of treating them; and that in general their Cour&s;e mu&s;t be determined, &s;ome time from the fourteenth to the thirtieth Day.</P>
<P>&sect; 241. The Treatment of this Species of Fevers is comprized in the following Method and Medicines.</P>
<P>1, The Patient mu&s;t be put into a Regimen; and notwith&s;tand|ing he is far from co&s;tive, and &s;ometimes has even a &s;mall Purging, he &s;hould receive one Gly&s;ter daily. His common Drink &s;hould be Lemonade, (which is made of the Juice of Lemons. Sugar and Water) or the Pti&s;an No. 3. In&s;tead of Juice of Lemons, Vinegar may be occa&s;ionally &s;ub&s;tituted, which, with Sugar and Water, makes an agreeable and very whole&s;ome Drink in the&s;e Fevers.</P>
<P>2, If there be an Inflammation al&s;o, which may be di&s;covered by the Strength and the Hardne&s;s of the Pul&s;e, and by the Tem|perament and Complexion of the Patient; if he is naturally ro|bu&s;t, and has heated him&s;elf by any of the Cau&s;es de&s;cribed, &sect; 232, he &s;hould be bled once, and even a &s;econd time, if nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ome Hours after. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, however, that very frequently there is no &s;uch Inflammation, and that in &s;uch a Ca&s;e Bleeding would be hurtful.</P>
<P>3, When the Patient has drank very plentifully for two Days of the&s;e Liquids, if his Mouth &s;till continues in a very foul State, and he has violent Reachings to vomit, he mu&s;t take the Powder No. 34, di&s;&s;olved in half a <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That is about two Ounces more than a Pint and half of our Mea&s;ure.</NOTE> Pot of warm Water; a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About three Ounces.</NOTE> Gla&s;s of it being to be drank every half Quarter of an Hour. But as this Medicine vomits, it mu&s;t not be taken, except we are certain the Patient is not under any Circum&s;tance which forbids the U&s;e of a Vomit: all which Circum&s;tances &s;hall be particularly mentioned in the Chapter, re&s;pecting the U&s;e of &s;uch Medicines, as are ta|ken by way of Precaution, or Prevention. If the fir&s;t Gla&s;&s;es excite a plentiful Vomiting, we mu&s;t forbear giving another, and be content with obliging the Patient to drink a con&s;iderable Quan|tity of warm Water. But if the former Gla&s;&s;es do not occa&s;ion Vomiting, they mu&s;t be repeated, as already directed until they do. Tho&s;e who are afraid of taking this Medicine, which is u&s;ually called the Emetic, may take that of No. 35, al&s;o drink|ing warm Water plentifully during its Operation; but the former is preferable, as more prevalent, in dangerous Ca&s;es. We mu&s;t caution our Readers at the &s;ame time, that wherever there is an Inflammation of any Part, neither of the&s;e Medicines mu&s;t be gi|ven, which might prove a real Poi&s;on in &s;uch a Circum&s;tance; and even if the Fever is extremely violent, though there &s;hould be no particular Inflammation, they &s;hould not be given.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="012243_0148_0F8DFBD694896E58">The Time of giving them is &s;oon after the End of the Pa|roxy&s;m, when the Fever is at the lowe&s;t. The Medicine No. 34 generally purges, after it cea&s;es to make the Patient vomit: But No. 35 is &s;eldom attended with the &s;ame Effect.</P>
<P>When the Operation of the Vomit is entirely over, the Sick &s;hould return to the U&s;e of the Pti&s;an; and great Care mu&s;t be taken to prohibit them from the U&s;e of Fle&s;h Broth, under the Pretext of working off a Purging with it. The &s;ame Method is to be continued on the following Days as on the fir&s;t; but as it is of Importance to keep the Body open, he &s;hould take every Morning &s;ome of the Pti&s;an No. 32. Such, as this would be too expen&s;ive for, may &s;ub&s;titute, in the room of it, a fourth Part of the Powder No. 34, that is, one Grain and a half of Tartar emetic, in five or &s;ix Gla&s;&s;es of Water, of which they are to take a Cup every two Hours, beginning early in the Morning. Ne|verthele&s;s, if the Fever be very high, No. 32 &s;hould be preferred to it.</P>
<P>4, After the Operation of the Vomit if the Fever &s;till continue, if the Stools are remarkably foetid; and if the Belly is ten&s;e and di&s;tended as it were, and the Quantity of Urine is &s;mall, a Spoon|ful of the Potion No. 10 &s;hould be given every two Hours which checks the Putridity, and abates the Fever. Should the Di&s;tem|per become violent, and very pre&s;&s;ing, it ought to be taken every Hour.</P>
<P>5, Whenever, notwith&s;tanding the giving all the&s;e Medicines as directed, the Fever continues ob&s;tinate; the Brain is manife&s;tly di&s;ordered; there is a violent Head-ach, or very great Re&s;tle&s;&s;|ne&s;s, two bli&s;tering Plai&s;ters No. 36 mu&s;t be applied to the in&s;ide and fle&s;hy Part of the Legs, and their Suppuration and Di&s;charge &s;hould be continued as long as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>6, If the Fever is extremely violent indeed, there is a Nece&s;&s;ity ab&s;olutely to prohibit the Patient from receiving the lea&s;t Nouri&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>7, When it is thought improper, or un&s;afe, to give the Vomit, the Patient &s;hould take in the Morning, for two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Days, three Do&s;es of the Powder No. 24, at the Interval of one Hour be|tween each: This Medicine produces &s;ome bilious Stools, which greatly abate the Fever, and con&s;iderably le&s;&s;en the Violence of all the other Symptoms of the Di&s;ea&s;e. This may be done with Succe&s;s, when the exce&s;&s;ive Height of the Fever prevents us from giving the Vomit: and we &s;hould limit our&s;elves to this Medicine, as often as we are uncertain, whether the Circum&s;tances of the Di&s;ea&s;e and the Patient will admit of the Vomiting; which may al&s;o be di&s;pen&s;ed with, in many Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>8, When the Di&s;temper has manife&s;tly and con&s;iderably de|clined, the Paroxy&s;ms are more &s;light; and the Patient continues without any Fever for &s;everal Hours, the daily U&s;e of the purg|ing opening Drinks &s;hould be di&s;continued. The common Pti&s;ans however &s;hould be &s;till made u&s;e of; and it will be proper to give
<PB N="129" REF="012243_0149_0F8DFBD745FA51B8">
every other Day two Do&s;es of the Powder No. 24, which &s;uffici|ently obviates every ill Con&s;equence from this Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>9, If the Fever has been clearly off for a long Part of the Day; if the Tongue appears in a good healthy State; if the Patient has been well purged; and yet one moderate Paroxy&s;m of the Fever returns every Day, he &s;hould take four Do&s;es <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As the&s;e contain but half a Drachm of the Bark, the Quantity of each Do&s;e might be doubled in large adult Per&s;ons: tho&s;e who were younger and &s;mall, might take two Scruples for each Do&s;e in the Intervals; and half a Drachm might &s;uffice for all from nine or ten Years to fourteen or fifteen. Howe|ver, if the Paroxy&s;ms have been gentle and regular, there is no Doubt but the Do&s;e directed by Dr. TISSOT might have a very good Effect; the Severity of the Fits and Symptoms requiring the large&s;t Quantities of the Bark, to be given during the Intermi&s;&s;ion. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> of the Powder No. 14, between the End of one Return and the Beginning of the next, and continue this Repetition &s;ome Days. People who can|not ea&s;ily procure this Medicine, may &s;ub&s;titute, in&s;tead of it, the bitter Decoction, No. 37, four Gla&s;&s;es of which may be taken at equal Intervals, between the two Paroxy&s;ms or Returns of the Fever.</P>
<P>10. As the Organs of Dige&s;tion have been con&s;iderably wea|kened through the Cour&s;e of this Fever, there is a Nece&s;&s;ity for the Patient's conducting him&s;elf very prudently and regularly long af|ter it, with Regard both to the Quantity and Quality of his Food. He &s;hould al&s;o u&s;e due Exerci&s;e, as &s;oon as his Strength will per|mit; without which he may be liable to fall into &s;ome chronical and langui&s;hing Di&s;order, productive of con&s;iderable Langour and Weakne&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As our Jail, Ho&s;pital, Camp, and often Ship Fevers may generally be ran|ged in this Cla&s;s, as of the mo&s;t putrid Kind, and not &s;eldom occa&s;ioned by bad Food, bad Air, unclean unwhole&s;ome Lodging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a judicious U&s;e may cer|tainly be made of a &s;mall Quantity of genuine, and not ungenerous Wine in &s;uch of them, as are not blended with an inflammatory Cau&s;e, or inflammable Con&s;titution, or which do not greatly re&s;ult from a bilious Cau&s;e; though in the&s;e la&s;t, where there is manife&s;t Lowne&s;s and Dejection, perhaps a little Rhe|ni&s;h might be properly interpo&s;ed between the Lemonade and other Drinks di|rected &sect; 241. Doubtle&s;s Dr. TISSOT was perfectly apprized of this &s;alutary U&s;e of it in &s;ome low Fevers; but the Nece&s;&s;ity of its being regulated by the Pre&s;ence of a Phy&s;ician has probably di&s;po&s;ed him rather to omit mentioning it, than to leave the Allowance of it to the Di&s;cretion of a &s;imple Country Patient, or his ignorant A&s;&s;i&s;tants. Wine, we know, was not the &s;malle&s;t Article in the Practice of Hippocrates, even in &s;ome feveri&s;h Di&s;orders; and, indeed, when greatly diluted, it becomes manife&s;tly acetous (acid) and may be &s;o managed, as to prove attemperating, if not even cooling. But what makes &s;till more for the prudent Exhibition of Wine, in this kind of Fevers, is the Experience of Dr. de Monchy, in his Account of Di&s;ea&s;es occurring in Voyages to the We&s;t Indies; who a&s;&s;ures us, that in the Treatment of a putrid Fever, on a Voyage to South America, he found a well regulated U&s;e, even of undiluted Wine, which the Pa|tients greatly coveted, very conducive to their Cure. All who have peru&s;ed the ingenious Dr. Pringle's Account of Camp Fevers, mu&s;t be abundantly convinced of the frequent Utility of Wine in them. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVII. Of malignant Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 242. THOSE Fevers are termed malignant, in which the Danger is more than the Symptoms would make us apprehen&s;ive of: they have frequently a fatal Event, without appearing &s;o ve|ry perilous; on which Account it has been well &s;aid of this Fe|ver, that it is a Dog which bites without barking.</P>
<P>&sect; 243, The di&s;tingui&s;hing <HI>Criterion</HI> or Mark of malignant Fe|vers is a total Lo&s;s of the Patient's Strength, immediately on their fir&s;t Attack. They ari&s;e from a Corruption of the Humours, which is noxious to the very Source and Principle of Strength, the Impairing or De&s;truction of which is the Cau&s;e of the Feeblene&s;s of the Symptoms; by Rea&s;on none of the Organs are &s;trong e|nough to exert an Oppo&s;ition &s;ufficiently vigorous, to &s;ubdue the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>If, for In&s;tance or Illu&s;tration, we were to &s;uppo&s;e, that when two Armies were on the Point of engaging, one of them &s;hould be nearly deprived of all their Weapons, the Conte&s;t would not appear very violent, nor attended with great Noi&s;e or Tumult, though with a horrible Ma&s;&s;acre. The Spectator (who, from be|ing ignorant of the Di&s;armament of one Army,) would not be a|ble to calculate the Carnage of the Battle, but in Proportion to its Noi&s;e and Tumult, mu&s;t be extremely deceived in his Conception of it. The Number of the Slain would be a&s;toni&s;hing, which might have been much le&s;s (though the Noi&s;e and Clangor of it had been greater) if each Army had been equally provided for the Combat.</P>
<P>&sect; 244. The Cau&s;es of this Di&s;ea&s;e are a long U&s;e of animal Food or Fle&s;h alone, without Puls, Fruits or Acids; the conti|nued U&s;e of other bad Provi&s;ions, &s;uch as Bread made of damaged Corn or Grain, or very &s;tale Meat. Eight Per&s;ons who dined to|gether on corrupt Fi&s;h, were all &s;eized with a malignant Fever, which killed five of them, notwith&s;tanding the Endeavours of the mo&s;t able Phy&s;icians. The&s;e Fevers are al&s;o frequently the Con|&s;equence of a great Dearth or Famine; of too hot and moi&s;t an Air, or an Air, which highly partakes of the&s;e two Qualities; &s;o that they happen to &s;pread mo&s;t in hot Years, in Places abounding with Mar&s;hes and &s;tanding Waters. They are al&s;o the Effects of a very clo&s;e and &s;tagnant Air, e&s;pecially if many Per&s;ons are crouded together in it, this being a Cau&s;e that particularly tends to corrupt the Air. Tedious Grief and Vexation al&s;o contribute to generate the&s;e Fevers.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="012243_0151_0F8DFBD8B3B021C8">&sect; 245. The Symptoms of malignant Fevers are, as I have al|ready ob&s;erved, a total and &s;udden Lo&s;s of Strength, without a|ny evident preceding Cau&s;e, &s;ufficient to procure &s;uch a Lo&s;s of it. At the &s;ame time there is al&s;o an utter Dejection of the Mind, which becomes almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible and inattentive to every thing, and even to the Di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf; a &s;udden Alteration in the Coun|tenance, e&s;pecially in the Eyes; &s;ome &s;mall Shiverings, which are varied throughout the Space of twenty-four Hours, with little Paroxy&s;ms or Vici&s;&s;itudes of Heat; &s;ometimes there is a great Head-ach and a Pain in the Loins; at other Times there is no perceivable Pain in any Part; a kind of Sinkings or Faintings, immediately from the Inva&s;ion of the Di&s;ea&s;e, which is always very unpromi&s;ing; not the lea&s;t refre&s;hing Sleep; frequently a kind of half Sleep, or Drow&s;ine&s;s; a light and &s;ilent or inward Raving, which di&s;covers it&s;elf in the unu&s;ual and a&s;toni&s;hed Look of the Patient, who &s;eems profoundly employed in medita|ting on &s;omething, but really thinks of nothing, or not at all: Some Patients have, however, violent Ravings; mo&s;t have a Sen|&s;ation of Weight or Oppre&s;&s;ion, and at other times of a Binding or Tightne&s;s about, or around, the Pit of the Stomach.</P>
<P>The &s;ick Per&s;on &s;eems to labour under great Angui&s;h: he has &s;ometimes &s;light convul&s;ive Motions and Twitchings in his Face and his Hands, as well as in his Arms and Legs. His Sen&s;es &s;eem torpid, or as it were benumbed. I have &s;een many who had lo&s;t, to all Appearance, the whole five, and yet &s;ome of them have re|covered. It is not uncommon to meet with &s;ome, who neither &s;ee, under&s;tand, nor &s;peak. Their Voices change, become weak, and are &s;ometimes quite lo&s;t. Some of them have a fixed Pain in &s;ome Part of the Belly: this ari&s;es from a Stuffing or Ob&s;truction, and often ends in a Gangrene, whence this Symptom is highly dangerous and perplexing.</P>
<P>The Tongue is &s;ometimes very little altered from its Appear|ance in Health; at other times it is covered over with a yellowi&s;h brown Humour; but it is more rarely dry in this Fever than in the others; and yet it &s;ometimes does re&s;emble a Tongue that has been long &s;moaked.</P>
<P>The Belly is &s;ometimes very &s;oft, and at other Times ten&s;e and hard. The Pul&s;e is weak, &s;ometimes pretty regular, but always more quick than in a natural State, and at &s;ometimes even very quick; and &s;uch I have always found it, when the Belly has been di&s;tended.</P>
<P>The Skin is often neither hot, dry, nor moi&s;t: it is frequent|ly over&s;pread with petechial or eruptive Spots (which are little Spots of a reddi&s;h livid Colour) e&s;pecially on the Neck, about the Shoulders, and upon the Back. At other times the Spots are larger and brown, like the Colour of Wheals from the Strokes of a Stick.</P>
<P>The Urine of the Sick is almo&s;t con&s;tantly crude, that is of a lighter Colour than ordinary. I have &s;een &s;ome, which could
<PB N="132" REF="012243_0152_0F8DFBD9695FDBA0">
not be di&s;tingui&s;hed, merely by the Eye, from Milk. A black and &s;tinking Purging &s;ometimes attends this Fever, which is mortal, except the Sick be evidently relieved by the Di&s;charge.</P>
<P>Some of the Patients are infe&s;ted with livid Ulcers on the In|&s;ide of the Mouth, and on the Palate. At other times Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es are formed in the Glands of the Groin, of the Arm-pit, in tho&s;e between the Ears and the Jaw; or a Gangrene may appear in &s;ome Part, as on the Feet, the Hands, or the Back. The Strength proves entirely &s;pent, the Brain is wholly confu&s;ed: the mi&s;era|ble Patient, &s;tretched out on his Back, frequently expires under Convul&s;ions, an enormous Sweat, and an oppre&s;&s;ed Brea&s;t and Re&s;piration. Haemorrhages al&s;o happen &s;ometimes and are mor|tal, being almo&s;t unexceptionably &s;uch in this Fever. There is al&s;o in this, as in all other Fevers, an Aggravation of the Fever in the Evening.</P>
<P>&sect; 246. The Duration and <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> of the&s;e malignant, as well as tho&s;e of putrid Fevers, are very irregular. Sometimes the Sick die on the &s;eventh or eighth Day, more commonly between the twelfth and the fifteenth, and not infrequently at the End of five or &s;ix Weeks. The&s;e different Durations re&s;ult from the different Degree and Strength of the Di&s;ea&s;e. Some of the&s;e Fevers at their fir&s;t Inva&s;ion are very &s;low; and during a few of the fir&s;t Days, the Patient, though very weak, and with a plainly diffe|rent Look and Manner, &s;carcely thinks him&s;elf &s;ick.</P>
<P>The Term or Period of the Cure or the Recovery, is as uncer|tain as that of Death, in this Di&s;temper. Some are out of Dan|ger at the End of fifteen Days, and even &s;ooner; others not be|fore the Expiration of &s;everal Weeks.</P>
<P>The Signs which portend a Recovery are, a little more Strength in the Pul&s;e; a more concocted Urine; le&s;s Dejection and Di&s;|couragement; a le&s;s confu&s;ed Brain; an equal kindly Heat; a pretty warm or hot Sweat in a moderate Quantity, without In|quietude or Angui&s;h; the Revival of the different Sen&s;es that were extingui&s;hed, or greatly &s;u&s;pended, in the Progre&s;s of the Di&s;ea&s;e; though the Deafne&s;s is not a very threatening Symptom, if the others amend while it continues.</P>
<P>This Malady commonly leaves the Patient in a very weak Con|dition; and a long Interval will en&s;ue between the End of it, and their recovering their full Strength.</P>
<P>&sect; 247. It is, in the fir&s;t place, of greater Importance in this Di&s;temper than in any other, both for the Benefit of the Patients, and tho&s;e who attend them, that the Air &s;hould be renewed and purified. Vinegar &s;hould often be evaporated from a hot Tile or Iron in the Chamber, and one Window kept almo&s;t con&s;tantly o|pen.</P>
<P>2, The Diet &s;hould be light; and the Juice of Sorrel may be mixed with their Water; the Juice of Lemons may be added to Soups prepared from different Grains and Puls; the Patient may
<PB N="133" REF="012243_0153_0F8DFBDA38F7E0A8">
eat &s;harp acid Fruits, &s;uch as tart juicy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>French</HI> Word is <HI>Griottes,</HI> which <HI>Boyer</HI> engli&s;hes, <HI>the Agriot the red or &s;our Cherry</HI>; and <HI>Chambaud. the &s;weeter large black Cherry or Mazzard</HI>&mdash;But as Dr. TISSOT was recommending the U&s;e of Acids, it is more probably the fir&s;t of the&s;e: &s;o that our Morellas, which make a plea&s;ant Pre&s;erve, may be a good Sub&s;titute to them, &s;uppo&s;ing them not to be the &s;ame.

<P>3, The Patient's Linen &s;hould be changed every two Days.</P>
<P>4, Bleeding is very rarely nece&s;&s;ary, or even proper, in this Fever; the Exceptions to which are very few, and cannot be thoroughly a&s;certained, as fit and proper Exceptions to the O|mi&s;&s;ion of Bleeding, without a Phy&s;ician, or &s;ome other very &s;kilful Per&s;on's &s;eeing the Patient.</P>
<P>5, There is often very little Occa&s;ion for Gly&s;ters, which are &s;ometimes even dangerous in this Fever.</P>
<P>6, The Patient's common Drink &s;hould be Barley Water, made acid with the Spirit No. 10, at the Rate of one Quarter of an Ounce to at lea&s;t full three Pints of the Water, or acidulated a|greeably to his Ta&s;t. He may al&s;o drink Lemonade.</P>
<P>7, It is nece&s;&s;ary to open and evacuate the Bowels, where a great Quantity of corrupt Humours is generally lodged. The Powder No. 35 may be given for this Purpo&s;e, after the Opera|tion of which the Patient generally finds him&s;elf better, at lea&s;t for &s;ome Hours, It is of Importance not to omit this at the Be|ginning of the Di&s;ea&s;e; though if it has been omitted at fir&s;t, it were be&s;t to give it even later, provided no particular Inflamma|tion has &s;upervened, and the Patient has &s;till &s;ome Strength.

<P>8, Having by this Medicine expelled a con&s;iderable Portion of the bad Humours, which contribute to feed and keep up the Fe|ver, the Patient &s;hould take every other Day, during the Conti|nuance of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;ometimes even every Day, one Do&s;e of the Cream of Tartar and Rhubarb No. 38. This Remedy e|vacuates the corrupt Humours, prevents the Corruption of the o|thers; expells the Worms that are very common in the&s;e Fevers, which the Patient &s;ometimes di&s;charges upwards and downwards; and which frequently conduce to many of the odd and extraordi|nary Symptoms, that are ob&s;erved in malignant Fevers. In &s;hort, it &s;trengthens the Bowels, and, without checking the nece&s;&s;ary E|vacuations, it moderates the Loo&s;ene&s;s, when it is hurtful.</P>

This Medicine, as the for|mer, is to be taken in the Morning; two Hours after, the Sick mu&s;t begin with the Potion, No. 40, and repeat it regularly e|very three Hours; until it be interrupted by giving one of the Me|dicines No. 38 or 39: After which the Potion is to be repeated again, as already directed, till the Patient grows con&s;iderably better.</P>
<P>10, If the Strength of the Sick be very con&s;iderably depre&s;&s;ed, and he is in great Dejection and Angui&s;h, he &s;hould take, with e|very Draught of the Potion, the Bolus, or Mor&s;el No. 41, If the <HI>Diarrhaea,</HI> the Purging is violent, there &s;hould be added, once or twice a Day to the Bolus, the Weight of twenty Grains, or the Size of a very &s;mall Bean, of <HI>Dia&s;cordium</HI>; or, if that is not rea|dily to be got, as much Venice Treacle.</P>

Their Suppuration and Di&s;charge is to be promoted abundantly; and, if they dry up within a few Days, others are to be applied, and their Evacuation is to be kept up for a con&s;iderable Time.</P>

<P>&sect; 248. It is nece&s;&s;ary to eradicate a Prejudice that prevails a|mong Country People, with Regard to the Treatment of the&s;e Fe|vers; not only becau&s;e it is fal&s;e and ridiculous, but even dange|rous too. They imagine that the Application of Animals can draw out the Poi&s;on of the Di&s;ea&s;e; in Con&s;equence of which they apply Poultry, or Pigeons, Cats, or &s;ucking Pigs to the Feet, or upon the Head of the Patient, having fir&s;t &s;plit the living Animals open. Some Hours after they remove their &s;trange Ap|plication, corrupted, and &s;tinking very offen&s;ively; and then a|&s;cribe &s;uch Corruption and horrid Stink to the Poi&s;on they &s;up|po&s;e their Application to be charged with; and which they &s;up|po&s;e to be the Cau&s;e of this Fever. But in this &s;uppo&s;ed Extrac|tion of Poi&s;on, they are gro&s;ly mi&s;taken, &s;ince the Fle&s;h does not &s;tink in Con&s;equence of any &s;uch Extraction, but from its being corrupted through Moi&s;ture and Heat: and they contract no o|ther Smell but what they would have got, if they had been put in any other Place, as well as on the Patient's Body, that was e|qually hot and moi&s;t. Very far from drawing out the Poi&s;on, they augment the Corruption of the Di&s;ea&s;e; and it would be &s;ufficient to communicate it to a &s;ound Per&s;on, if he was to &s;uffer many of the&s;e animal Bodies, thus ab&s;urdly and u&s;ele&s;sly butcher|ed, to be applied to various Parts of his Body in Bed; and to lie &s;till a long time with their putrified Carca&s;es fa&s;tened about him, and corrupting whatever Air he breathed there.</P>
<P>With the &s;ame Intention they fa&s;ten a living Sheep to the Bed's-&s;oot for &s;everal Hours: which, though not equally dangerous, is in &s;ome Mea&s;ure hurtful; &s;ince the more Animals there are in a Chamber, the Air of it is proportionably corrupted, or alter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d at lea&s;t from its natural Simplicity, by their Re&s;piration and Ex|halations; but admitting this to be le&s;s pernicious, it is equally ab&s;urd. It is certain indeed the Animals, who are kept very near the &s;ick Per&s;on, breathe in the poi&s;onous, or noxious Vapours which exhale from his Body, and may be incommoded with them, as well as his Attendants: but it is ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e their be|ing kept near the Sick cau&s;es &s;uch Poi&s;on to come out of their Bodies. On the very contrary, in contributing &s;till further to the Corruption of the Air, they increa&s;e the Di&s;ea&s;e. They draw a fal&s;e Con&s;equence, and no Wonder, from a fal&s;e Principle; &s;ay|ing, if the Sheep dies the Sick will recover. Now, mo&s;t frequent|ly the Sheep does not die; notwith&s;tanding which the Sick &s;ometimes recover; and &s;ometimes they both die.</P>

It is blended, for In&s;tance, with the Poi&s;on of the Small-Pocks, or of the Mea&s;les.

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVIII. Of intermitting Fevers.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 250. INTERMITTING Fevers, commonly called here, Fevers and A|gues, are tho&s;e, which, after an Inva&s;ion and Continuance for &s;ome Hours, abate very perceivably, as well as all the Symp|toms attending them, and then entirely cea&s;e: neverthele&s;s, not without &s;ome periodical or &s;tated Return of them.</P>
<P>They were very frequent with us &s;ome Years &s;ince; and indeed might even be called epidemical: but for the five or &s;ix la&s;t Years, they have been much le&s;s frequent throughout the greater Part of <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland</HI>: notwith&s;tanding they &s;till continue in no &s;mall Number, wherever the Inhabitants breathe the Air that prevails in all the mar&s;hy Borders of the <HI>Rhone,</HI> and in &s;ome other Situa|tions that are expo&s;ed to much the &s;ame humid Air and Exhala|tions.</P>
<P>&sect; 251. There are &s;everal Kinds of intermitting Fevers, which take their different Names from the Interval, or different Space of time, in which the Fits return.</P>
<P>If the Paroxy&s;m or Fit returns every Day, it is either a true Quotidian, or a double Tertian Fever: The fir&s;t of the&s;e may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the la&s;t by this Circum&s;tance, that in the Quo|tidian, or one Day Fever, the Fits are long; and corre&s;pond pret|ty regularly to each other in Degree and Duration. This how|ever is le&s;s frequent in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland.</HI> In the double Tertian, the Fits are &s;horter, one being alternately light, and the other more &s;evere.</P>
<P>In the &s;imple Tertian, or third Day's Fever, the Fits return e|very other Day; &s;o that three Days include one Paroxy&s;m, and the Return of another.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="012243_0157_0F8DFBDDE63B2F88">In a Quartan, the Fit returns every fourth Day, including the Day of the fir&s;t and that of the &s;econd Attack: &s;o that the Pa|tient enjoys two clear Days between the two &s;ick ones.</P>
<P>The other kinds of Intermittents are much rarer. I have &s;een however one true Quintan, or fifth Day Ague, the Patient hav|ing three clear Days between two Fits; and one regularly weekly Ague, as it may be called, the Vi&s;itation of every Return happen|ing every Sunday.</P>
<P>&sect; 252. The fir&s;t Attack of an intermittent Fever often happens, when the Patient thought him&s;elf in perfect Health. Sometimes however it is preceded by a Sen&s;ation of Cold, and a kind of Numbne&s;s, which continue &s;ome Days before the manife&s;t Inva|&s;ion of the Fit&punc; It begins with frequent Yawnings, a La&s;&s;itude, or Sen&s;ation of Wearine&s;s, with a general Weakne&s;s, with Cold|ne&s;s, Shivering and Shaking: There is al&s;o a Palene&s;s of the ex|treme Parts of the Body, attended with Loathings, and &s;ome|times an actual Vomiting. The Pul&s;e is quick, weak, and &s;mall, and there is a con&s;iderable Degree of Thir&s;t.</P>
<P>At the End of an Hour or two, and but &s;eldom &s;o long as three or four Hours, a Heat &s;ucceeds, which increa&s;es in&s;en&s;ibly, and becomes violent at its Height. At this Period the whole Body grows red, the Anxiety of the Patient abates; the Pul&s;e is very &s;trong and large, and his Thir&s;t proves exce&s;&s;ive. He complains of a violent Head-ach, and of a Pain in all his Limbs; but of a different. Sort of Pain from that he was &s;en&s;ible of, while his Coldne&s;s continued. Finally, having endured this hot State, four, five, or &s;ix Hours, he falls into a general Sweat for a few more: upon which all the Symptoms already mentioned abate, and &s;ometimes Sleep &s;upervenes.</P>
<P>At the Conclu&s;ion of this Nap the Patient often wakes without any &s;en&s;ible Fever; Complaining only of La&s;&s;itude and Weakne&s;s. Sometimes his Pul&s;e returns entirely to its natural State between the two Fits; though it often continues a little quicker than in perfect Health; and does not recover its fir&s;t Di&s;tinctne&s;s and Slowne&s;s, till &s;ome Days after the la&s;t Fit.</P>
<P>One Symptom, which mo&s;t particularly characteri&s;es the&s;e &s;eve|ral Species of intermitting Fevers, is the Quality of the Urines which the Sick pa&s;s after the Fit. They are of a reddi&s;h Colour, and let fall a Sediment, or Settling, which exactly re&s;embles Brick-du&s;t. They are &s;ometimes frothy too, and a Pellicle, or very thin filmy Skin, appears on the Top, and adheres to the Sides of the Gla&s;s that contains them.</P>
<P>&sect; 253. The Duration of each Fit is of no fixed Time or Ex|tent, being various according to the particular &s;ort of Intermit|tents, and through many other Circum&s;tances. Sometimes they return preci&s;ely at the very &s;ame Hour; at other times they come one, two or three Hours &s;ooner; and in other In&s;tances as much later than the former. It has been imagined that tho&s;e Fevers,
<PB N="138" REF="012243_0158_0F8DFBE22E9DA7A0">
who&s;e Paroxy&s;ms returned &s;ooner than u&s;ual, were &s;ooner finally terminated: but there &s;eems to be no general Rule in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; 254. Intermitting Fevers are di&s;tingui&s;hed into tho&s;e of Spring and Autumn. The former generally prevail from Febru|ary to June: the latter are tho&s;e which reign from July to Janu|ary. Their e&s;&s;ential Nature and Characters are the very &s;ame, as they are not different Di&s;tempers; though the various Circum|&s;tances attending them de&s;erve our Con&s;ideration. The&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances depend on the Sea&s;on it&s;elf, and the Con&s;titution of the Patients, during &s;uch Sea&s;on. The Spring Intermittents are &s;ometimes blended with an inflammatory Di&s;po&s;ition, that being the u&s;ual Di&s;po&s;ition of Bodies in that Sea&s;on; but as the Wea|ther then advances daily into an improving State, the Spring Fe|vers are commonly of a &s;horter Duration. The autumnal Fe|vers are frequently combined and aggravated with a Principle of Putrefaction; and as the Air of that Sea&s;on rather degenerates, they are more tedious and ob&s;tinate.</P>
<P>&sect; 255. The autumnal Fevers &s;eldom begin quite &s;o early as July, but much oftner in Augu&s;t: and the Duration to which they are frequently extended, has increa&s;ed the Terror which the People entertain of Fevers that begin in that Month. But that Prejudice which a&s;cribes their Danger to the Influence of Augu&s;t, is a very ab&s;urd Error; &s;ince it is better they &s;hould &s;et in then, than in the following Months; becau&s;e they are ob&s;tinate in Pro|portion to the Tardine&s;s, the Slowne&s;s, of their Approach. They &s;ometimes appear at fir&s;t con&s;iderably in the Form of putrid Fe|vers. not a&s;&s;uming that of Intermittents till &s;ome Days after their Appearance: but very happily there is little or no Danger in mi&s;|taking them for putrid Fevers, or in treating them like &s;uch. The Brick-coloured Sediment, and particularly the Pellicle or Film on the Surface of the Urine, are very common in autumnal Intermittents, and are often wanting in the Urine of putrid Fe|vers. In the&s;e latter, it is generally le&s;s high coloured, and lean|ing rather to a yellow, a kind of Cloudine&s;s is &s;u&s;pended in the Middle of it. The&s;e al&s;o depo&s;ite a white Sediment, which af|fords no bad Progno&s;tic.</P>
<P>&sect; 256. Generally &s;peaking, intermitting Fevers are not mortal; often terminating in Health of their own Accord (without the U&s;e of any Medicines) after &s;ome Fits. In this la&s;t Re&s;pect In|termittents in the Spring differ con&s;iderably from tho&s;e in the Fall, which continue a long time, and &s;ometimes even until Spring, if they are not removed by Art, or if they have been im|properly treated.</P>
<P>Quartan Fevers are always more ob&s;tinate and inveterate than Tertians; the former &s;ometimes per&s;evering in certain Con&s;titu|tions for whole Years. When the&s;e Sorts of Fevers occur in bog|gy mar&s;hy Countries, they are not only very chronical or tedious, but Per&s;ons infe&s;ted with them are liable to frequent Relap&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="012243_0159_0F8DFBE39DDDC850">&sect; 257. A few Fits of an Intermittent are not very injurious, and it happens &s;ometimes, that they are attended with a favoura|ble Alteration of the Habit in Point of Health; by their exter|minating the Cau&s;e or Principle of &s;ome languid and tedious Di&s;|order; though it is erroneous to con&s;ider them as &s;alutary. If they prove tedious and ob&s;tinate, and the Fits are long and violent, they weaken the whole Body, impairing all its Functions, and particularly the Dige&s;tions: They make the Humours &s;harp and unbalmy, and introduce &s;everal other Maladies, &s;uch as the Jaun|dice, Drop&s;y, A&s;thma, and &s;low wa&s;ting Fevers. Nay &s;ome|times old Per&s;ons, and tho&s;e who are very weak, expire in the Fit; though &s;uch an Event never happens but in the cold Fit.</P>
<P>&sect; 258. Very happily Nature has afforded us a Medicine, that in|fallibly cures the&s;e Fevers; this is the <HI>Kinkina,</HI> or Je&s;uits Bark; and as we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this certain Remedy, the only remain|ing Difficulty is to di&s;cover, if there be not &s;ome other Di&s;ea&s;e combined with the&s;e Fevers, which Di&s;ea&s;e might be aggravated by the Bark. Should any &s;uch exi&s;t, it mu&s;t be removed by Me|dicines adapted to it, before the Bark is given. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This admirable Medicine was unknown in <HI>Europe,</HI> 'till about one hundred and twenty years pa&s;t; we are obliged to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for it, who found it in the Province of <HI>Quito</HI> in <HI>Peru</HI>; the Counte&s;s of <HI>Chinchon</HI> being the fir&s;t <HI>European</HI> who u&s;ed it in <HI>America,</HI> whence it was brought to <HI>Spain,</HI> under the Name of the Counte&s;s's Powder. The Je&s;uits having &s;oon di&s;pen&s;ed and di&s;tributed it abroad, it became &s;till more publick by the Name of the Je&s;uits Powder: and &s;ince it has been known by that of <HI>Kinkina</HI> or the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Bark. It met with great Oppo|&s;ition at fir&s;t; &s;ome deeming it a Poi&s;on, while others con&s;idered it as a divine Remedy: &s;o that the Prejudices of many being heightened by their Animo&s;ity, it was nearly a full Century, before its true Virtue and its U&s;e were agreed to: and about twenty Years &s;ince the mo&s;t unfavourable Prejudices again&s;t it pretty ge|nerally &s;ub&s;ided. The In&s;ufficience of other Medicines in &s;everal Ca&s;es; its great Efficaciou&s;ne&s;s; and the many and &s;urprizing Cures which it did, and daily does effect; the Number of Di&s;tempers; the different Kinds of Fevers, in which it proves the &s;overeign Remedy; its Effects in the mo&s;t difficult chirurgical Ca&s;es; the Comfort, the Strength and Spirits it gives tho&s;e who need and take it, have at length opened every Per&s;on's Eyes; &s;o that it has almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly obtained the fir&s;t Reputation, among the mo&s;t efficacious Medicines. The World is no longer amu&s;ed with Apprehen&s;ions of its injuring the Stomach; of its fixing or <HI>&s;hutting up</HI> the Fever (as the Phra&s;e has been) without curing it; that it &s;huts up the Wolf in the Sheepfold; that it throws tho&s;e who take it into the Scurvy, the A&s;thma, the Drop&s;y, the Jaundice. On the contrary, they are per&s;uaded it prevents the&s;e very Di&s;ea&s;es; and, that if it is ever hurtful, it is only when it is either adul|terated, as mo&s;t great Remedies have been; or has been wrongly pre&s;cribed, or improperly taken; or la&s;tly, when it meets with &s;ome latent, &s;ome unknown Particularities in a Con&s;titution, which Phy&s;icians term an <HI>Idio&s;yncra&s;y,</HI> and which prevent or pervert its very general Effects.

<P>&sect; 259. In the Vernal, or Spring-Fevers, if the Fits are not very &s;evere; if the Patient is evidently well in their Intervals; if his Appetite, his Strength, and his Sleep continue as in Health, no Medicine &s;hould be given, nor any other Method be taken, but that of putting the Per&s;on, under &s;uch a gentle Intermittent, upon the Regimen directed for Per&s;ons in a State of Recovery.
<PB N="140" REF="012243_0160_0F8DFBE46F47A728">
This is &s;uch a Regimen as pretty generally agrees with all the Sub|jects of the&s;e Fevers: for if they &s;hould be reduced to the Regi|men proper in acute Di&s;ea&s;es, they would be weakened to no Pur|po&s;e, and perhaps be the wor&s;e for it. But at the &s;ame time if we were not to retrench from the Quantity, nor &s;omewhat to vary the Quality, of their u&s;ual Food in a State of Health; as there is not the lea&s;t Dige&s;tion made in the Stomach, during the whole Term of the Fit; and as the Stomach is always weakened a little by the Di&s;ea&s;e, crude and indige&s;ted Humours would be pro|duced, which might afford a Fuel to that Di&s;ea&s;e. Not the lea&s;t &s;olid Food &s;hould be allowed, for at lea&s;t two Hours before the u&s;ual Approach of the Fit.</P>
<P>&sect; 260.

Should the Fits be very &s;trong, the Pain of the Head violent, the Vi&s;age red, the Pul&s;e full and hard; if there is any Cough; if even after the Fit is over, the Pul&s;e &s;till is perceiva|bly hard; if the Urine is inflamed, hot and high-coloured, and the Tongue very dry, the Patient mu&s;t be bled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This does not &s;eem directed, with Re&s;pect to the Cure of the Intermittent, but from a judicious Caution to prevent its degenerating into a continual Fever; into which, in &s;uch full and &s;anguine Habits, as are mo&s;t liable to the&s;e acute Symptoms, it certainly &s;ometimes has degenerated. Bleeding therefore, under the&s;e Circum&s;tances, has a very probable Tendency to fix it, as an Intermittent, which is by much the le&s;s dangerous Di&s;ea&s;e. But bleeding Patients of low lax Habits in, or &s;oon after, the Cure of Intermittents, whether with or without the Bark, as well as &s;evere or un&s;ea&s;onable Purging, has certainly been found to oc|ca&s;ion Relap&s;es, and to render the Di&s;ea&s;e more chronical. Rhubarb in Powder &s;eems the be&s;t Purge, where Purging may be nece&s;&s;ary, after an Intermittent; and it would be &s;till the better, if a third Part of the Bark were given with it. <HI>K.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. TISSOT's own Sentiments on the&s;e Evacuations in this Di&s;ea&s;e, e&s;pecially in Quartans, follow &sect; 262 and 3.</P></NOTE>, and drink plen|tifully of Barley Water No. 3. The&s;e two Remedies generally bring the Patient into the State de&s;cribed &sect; 259: in which State he may take on a Day, when the Fever is entirely off, three or four Do&s;es of the Powder No. 24, and then leave the Fever to pur&s;ue its own Cour&s;e for the Space of a few Fits. But &s;hould it not then terminate of it&s;elf, the Bark mu&s;t be recurred to.</P>
<P>If the Patient, even in the Interval of the Returns, has a foetid, furred Mouth, a Loathing, Pains in the Loins, or in the Knees, much Anxiety, and bad Nights, he &s;hould be purged with the Powder No. 21 or the Potion No. 23, before he takes the Bark.</P>
<P>&sect; 262. If Fevers in Autumn appear to be of the continual Kind, and very like putrid Fevers, the Patients &s;hould drink abun|dantly of Barley Water; and if at the Expiration of two or three Days, there &s;till appears to be a Load or Oppre&s;&s;ion at the Stomach, the Powder No. 34 or that of 35 is to be given (but &s;ee &sect; 241): and if, after the Operation of this, the Signs of Pu|tridity continue, the Body is to be opened with repeated Do&s;es of the Powder No. 24; or where the Patients are very robu&s;t, with No. 21; and when the Fever becomes quite regular, with di&s;tinct <HI>Remi&s;&s;ions</HI> at lea&s;t, the Bark is to be given as directed &sect; 260.</P>
<P>But as autumnal Fevers are more ob&s;tinate; after having di&s;|continued the Bark for eight Days; and notwith&s;tanding there has been no Return of the Fever, it is proper to re&s;ume the Bark, and to give three Do&s;es of it daily for the &s;ucceeding eight Days, more e&s;pecially if it was a Quartan; in which Species I have or|dered it to be repeated, every other eight Days, for &s;ix times.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="012243_0162_0F8DFBE56A266BA8">Many People may find it difficult to comply with this Method of Cure, which is unavoidably expen&s;ive, through the Price of the Bark. I thought however this ought not to prevent me from averring it to be the only certain one; &s;ince nothing can be an equivalent <HI>Succedaneum</HI> or Sub&s;titute to this Remedy, which is the only &s;ure and &s;afe one in all the&s;e Ca&s;es. The World had long been prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with Prejudices to the contrary: it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be hurtful to the Stomach; to prevent which it has been u&s;ual to make the Sick eat &s;omething an Hour after it. Neverthele&s;s, very far from injuring the Stomach, it is the be&s;t Medicine in the Univer&s;e to &s;trengthen it; and it is a pernicious Cu&s;tom, when a Patient is obliged to take it often, to eat an Hour after it. It had al&s;o been imagined to cau&s;e Ob&s;tructions, and that it &s;ubjected Pa|tients to a Drop&s;y: but at pre&s;ent we are convinced, it is the ob&s;ti|nate and inveterate Duration of the Intermittent, that cau&s;es Ob|&s;tructions, and paves the Way to a Drop&s;y. The Bark, in Con|&s;equence of its &s;peedily curing the Fever, does not only prevent the former Di&s;ea&s;e; but when it continues, through an injudici|ous Omi&s;&s;ion of the Bark, a proper U&s;e of it is &s;erviceable in the Drop&s;y. In a Word, if there is any other Malady combined with the Fever, &s;ometimes <HI>that</HI> indeed prevents the Succe&s;s of the Bark, yet without rendering it hurtful. But whenever the intermitting Fever is &s;imple and uncombined, it ever has, and will render the Patient all po&s;&s;ible Service. In another Place I &s;hall mention &s;uch Means and Methods as may in &s;ome Degree, though but inadequately, be &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of it.</P>
<P>After the Patient has begun with the Bark, he mu&s;t take no purging Medicine, as that Evacuation would, with the greate&s;t Probability, occa&s;ion a Return of the Fever.</P>
<P>&sect; 263. Bleeding is never, or extremely &s;eldom indeed, nece&s;&s;ary in a Quartan Ague, which occurs in the Fall oftner than in the Spring; and with the Symptoms of Putridity, rather than of Inflammation. See Note * &sect; 261.</P>
<P>&sect; 264. The Patient ought, two Hours before the Inva&s;ion of the Fit, to drink a &s;mall Gla&s;s of warm Elder-flower Tea, &s;weet|ened with Honey, every Quarter of an Hour, and to walk about moderately: this di&s;po&s;es him to a very gentle Sweat, and thence renders the en&s;uing Coldne&s;s and the whole Fit milder. He is to continue the &s;ame Drink throughout the Duration of the cold Fit; and when the hot one approaches, he may either continue the &s;ame, or &s;ub&s;titute that of No. 2, which is more cooling. It is not nece&s;&s;ary however, in this State, to drink it warm, it is &s;uf|ficient that it be not over cold. When the Sweat, at the Termi|nation of the hot Fit, is concluded, the Patient &s;hould be well wiped and dried, and may get up. If the Fit was very long, he may be allowed a little Gruel, or &s;ome other &s;uch Nouri&s;hment during the Sweat.</P>
<P>&sect; 265. Sometimes the fir&s;t, and a few &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Do&s;es of the Bark purge the Patient. This is no otherwi&s;e an ill Con&s;equence,
<PB N="143" REF="012243_0163_0F8DFBE646ED21E0">
than by its retarding the Cure; &s;ince, when it purges, it does not commonly [<HI>though &s;ometimes</HI>] prevent the Return of the Fever; &s;o that the&s;e Do&s;es may be con&s;idered as to no Purpo&s;e, and others &s;hould be repeated, which, cea&s;ing to purge, do prevent it. Should the Loo&s;ene&s;s notwith&s;tanding continue, the Bark mu&s;t be di&s;continued for one entire Day, in order to give the Patient half a Quarter of an Ounce of Rhubarb: after which the Bark is to be re&s;umed again; and if the Loo&s;ene&s;s &s;till per&s;everes, fifteen Grains of Venice Treacle &s;hould be added to each Do&s;e, but not otherwi&s;e. All other Medicines which are &s;uperadded, very ge|nerally &s;erve only to increa&s;e the Bulk of the Do&s;e, while they le&s;&s;en its Virtue.</P>
<P>&sect; 266. Before our thorough Experience of the Bark, other bit|ter Medicines were u&s;ed for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e: the&s;e indeed were not de&s;titute of Virtue in &s;uch Ca&s;es, though they were con&s;idera|bly le&s;s available than the Bark. Under No. 43, &s;ome valuable Pre&s;criptions of that kind may be &s;een, who&s;e Efficacy I have of|ten experienced: though at other times I have been obliged to leave them off, and recur to the Bark more &s;ucce&s;sfully. Filings of Iron, which enter into the third Pre&s;cription, are an excellent Febrifuge in particular Ca&s;es and Circum&s;tances. In the Middle of the Winter 1753, I cured a Patient of a Quartan Ague with it, who would not be prevailed on to take the Bark. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed he was perfectly regular in ob&s;erving the Regimen direct|ed for him; and that, during the mo&s;t rigid Severity of the Win|ter, he got every Day on Hor&s;eback, and took &s;uch a Degree of other Exerci&s;e in the open Air, as di&s;po&s;ed him to per&s;pire abun|dantly.</P>
<P>&sect; 267. Another very practicable ea&s;y Method, of which I have often availed my Patients, under Tertian Fevers (but which &s;uc|ceeded with me only twice in Quartans) was to procure the Suf|ferer a very plentiful Sweat, at the very time when the Fit was to return, in its u&s;ual Cour&s;e. To effect this he is to drink, three or four Hours before it is expected, an Infu&s;ion of Elder-flowers &s;weetened with Honey, which I have already recommended &sect; 264; and one Hour before the u&s;ual Inva&s;ion of the Shivering, he is to go into Bed, and take, as hot as he can drink it, the Pre&s;cription No. 44.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o cured &s;ome Tertians and even Quartans, in 1751 and 1752, by giving them, every four Hours between the Fits, the Powder No. 45. But I mu&s;t acknowledge that, be&s;ides its having often failed me, and its never &s;ucceeding &s;o &s;peedily as the Bark, I have found it weaken &s;ome Patients; it di&s;orders, or di&s;|agrees with, their Stomachs: and in two Ca&s;es, where it had re|moved the Fever, I was obliged to call in the Bark, for a tho|rough E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Patient's Health. Neverthele&s;s as the&s;e Medicines are very cheap and attainable, and often do &s;uc|ceed, I thought I could not properly omit them.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="012243_0164_0F8DFBE6E6CE18E8">&sect; 268. A Multitude of other Remedies are cried up for the Cure of Fevers: though none of them are equally efficacious with tho&s;e I have directed; and as many of them are even dan|gerous, it is prudent to ab&s;tain from them. Some Years &s;ince certain Powders were &s;old here, under the Name of the <HI>Berlin</HI> Powders; the&s;e are nothing but the Bark ma&s;qued or di&s;gui&s;ed (which has &s;ometimes been publickly di&s;covered) and have always been &s;old very dear: though the Bark well cho&s;en, and fre&s;hly powdered when wanted, is greatly preferable.</P>
<P>&sect; 269. I have often known Pea&s;ants, who had laboured for &s;everal Months under intermitting Fevers; having made U&s;e of many bad Medicines and Mixtures for them, and ob&s;erved no Manner of Regimen. Such I have happily treated by giving them the Remedies No. 34, or 35; and afterwards, for &s;ome Days, that of No. 38; at the End of which time, I have ordered them the Bark, (See &sect; 260,) or other Febrifuges, as at &sect; 266, 267: and then finally directed them for &s;ome Days, to take Mor|&s;els of the poor Man's Treacle (See &sect; 247, <HI>Art.</HI> 13,) to &s;trengthen and confirm their Dige&s;tions, which I have found very weak and irregular.</P>
<P>&sect; 270. Some Intermittents are di&s;tingui&s;hed as pernicious or malignant, from every Fit's being attended with the mo&s;t violent Symptoms. The Pul&s;e is &s;mall and irregular, the Patient exceed|ingly dejected, and frequently &s;wooning; afflicted with inexpre&s;&s;i|ble Angui&s;h, Convul&s;ions, a deep Drow&s;ine&s;s, and continual Ef|forts to go to Stool, or make Urine, but ineffectually. This Di&s;|ea&s;e is highly pre&s;&s;ing and dangerous; the Patient may die in the third Fit, and rarely &s;urvives the &s;ixth, if he is not very judici|ou&s;ly treated. Not a Moment &s;hould be lo&s;t, and there is no other Step to be taken, but that of giving the Bark continually, as directed &sect; 260, to prevent the &s;ucceeding Fits. The&s;e wor&s;t Kinds of Intermittents are often combined with a great Load of putrid Humours in the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages: and as often as &s;uch an ag|gravating Combination is very evident, we &s;hould immediately after the End of one Fit, give a Do&s;e of Ipecacuana No. 35, and when its Operation is fini&s;hed, give the Bark. But I chu&s;e to enter into very few Details on this Species of Intermittents, both as they occur but &s;eldom, and as the Treatment of them is too difficult and important, to be &s;ubmitted to the Conduct of any one but a Phy&s;ician. My Intention has only been to repre&s;ent them &s;ufficiently, that they may be &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed when they do oc|cur, as to apprize the People of their great Danger.</P>
<P>&sect; 271. The &s;ame Cau&s;e which produces the&s;e intermitting Fe|vers, frequently al&s;o occa&s;ions Di&s;orders, that return periodically at the &s;ame Hour, without Shivering, without Heat, and often without any Quickne&s;s of the Pul&s;e. Such Di&s;orders generally ob&s;erve the Intermi&s;&s;ions of quotidian or tertian Fevers, but much &s;eldomer tho&s;e of Quartans. I have &s;een violent Vomitings, and Reachings to vomit, with inexpre&s;&s;ible Anxiety; the &s;evere&s;t Op|pre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="145" REF="012243_0165_0F8DFBE8688AE030">
the mo&s;t racking Cholics; dreadful Palpitations and ex|ce&s;&s;ive Tooth-achs; Pains in the Head, and very often an unac|countable Pain over one Eye, the Eyelid, Eyebrow and Temple, on the &s;ame Side of the Face; with a Redne&s;s of that Eye, and a continual, involuntary trickling of Tears. I have al&s;o &s;een &s;uch a prodigious Swelling of the affected Part, that the Eye pro|jected, or &s;tood out, above an Inch from the Head, covered by the Eyelid, which was al&s;o extremely inflated, or puffed up. All the&s;e Maladies begin preci&s;ely at a certain Hour, la&s;t about the u&s;ual time of a Fit; and terminating without any &s;en&s;ible Evacu|ation, return exactly at the &s;ame Hour, the next Day, or the next but one.</P>
<P>There is but one known Medicine that can effectually oppo&s;e this Sort, which is the Bark, given as directed &sect; 260. Nothing affords Relief in the Fit, and no other Medicine ever &s;u&s;pends or puts it off. But I have cured &s;ome of the&s;e Di&s;orders with the Bark, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e affecting the Eyes, which happen of|tener than the other Symptoms, after their Duration for many Weeks, and after the ineffectual U&s;e of Bleeding, Purging, Baths, Waters, Bli&s;ters, and a great Number of other Medicines. If a &s;ufficient Do&s;e of it be given, the next fit is very mild; the &s;e|cond is prevented; and I never &s;aw a Relap&s;e in the&s;e Ca&s;es, which &s;ometimes happens after the Fits of common Intermittents &s;eemed cured.</P>
<P>&sect; 272. In Situations where the Con&s;titution of the Air renders the&s;e Fevers very common, the Inhabitants &s;hould frequently burn in their Rooms, at lea&s;t in their lodging Rooms, &s;ome aromatic Wood or Herbs. They &s;hould daily chew &s;ome Juniper Berries, and drink a fermented Infu&s;ion of them. The&s;e two Remedies are very effectual to fortify the weake&s;t Stomachs, to prevent Ob|&s;tructions, and to promote Per&s;piration. And as the&s;e are the Cau&s;es which prolong the&s;e Fevers the mo&s;t ob&s;tinately; nothing is a more certain Pre&s;ervation from them than the&s;e cheap and ob|vious A&s;&s;i&s;tances. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I have &s;een &s;everal Ca&s;es in very mar&s;hy maratime Countries, with little good drinking Water, and far South of <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> where intermitting Fevers, with Agues at different Intervals, are annually endemic, very popular, and often &s;o ob&s;tinate as to return repeatedly, whenever the weekly precautionary Do&s;es of the Bark have been omitted, (through the Patient's nau&s;eating the fre|quent Swallowing of it,) &s;o that the Di&s;ea&s;e has &s;ometimes been extended be|yond the Term of a full Year, and even far into a &s;econd, including the tempo|rary Removals of it by the Bark. Neverthele&s;s, in &s;ome &s;uch ob&s;tinate inter|mittents, and particularly Quartans there, wherein the Bark alone has had but a &s;hort and imperfect Effect, I have known the following Compo&s;ition, after a good Vomit, (taken about an Hour before the u&s;ual Return of the Fit, at which Juncture it operates bri&s;kly,) attended with &s;peedy and final Succe&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> Take of fre&s;h Sa&s;&s;afras Bark, of <HI>Virginia</HI> Snake-root, of Roch-Allom, of Nutmeg, of diaphoretic Antimony, of Salt of Wormwood, of each one Drachm. To the&s;e well rubbed together into fine Powder, add the Weight of the whole, of the be&s;t and fre&s;he&s;t Bark; then drop in three or four Drops of the chemical Oil of Mint, and with Syrup of Cloves, or Saffion, make it into the Con&s;i&s;tence of an Electu|ary or Bolus, for twelve Do&s;es for a grown Per&s;on, to be taken at the Di&s;tance of three or four Hours from each other, while the Patient is awake, according to the longer or &s;horter Intermi&s;&s;ion of the Fever.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o known, particularly in ob&s;tinate autumnal Agues there, an Infu|&s;ion of two Ounces of the be&s;t Bark in fine Powder, or two Ounces and a Half in gro&s;s Powder, in a Quart of the be&s;t Brandy, for three or four Days (a &s;mall Wine Gla&s;s to be taken by grown Per&s;ons at the Di&s;tance of from four to &s;ix Hours) effectually and &s;peedily terminate &s;uch inveterate Agues, as had given but little Way to the Bark in Sub&s;tance. This was certainly mo&s;t &s;uitable for tho&s;e who were not of a light delicate Habit and Temperament, and who had not been remarkable for their Ab&s;tinence from &s;trong Liquors: the inebriating Force of the Brandy being remarkably le&s;&s;ened by the Addition, and long Infu|&s;ion, of the Bark. The&s;e Facts which I &s;aw, are the le&s;s to be wondered at, as in &s;uch inveterate, but perfectly clear and di&s;tinct Intermittents, both the State of the Fluids and Solids &s;eem very oppo&s;ite to their State in an acutely inflam|matory Di&s;ea&s;e. <HI>K.</HI></P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIX. Of the Eri&s;ipelas, and the Bites of Animals.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 273. THE Eri&s;ipelas, commonly called in Engli&s;h, St. Anthony's Fire, and in Swi&s;&s;erland <HI>the Violet,</HI> is &s;ometimes but a very &s;light Indi&s;po&s;ition which appears on the Skin, without the Per|&s;on's being &s;en&s;ible of any other Di&s;order; and it mo&s;t common|ly breaks out either in the Face, or on the Legs. The Skin be|comes ten&s;e, or &s;tiff, rough and red; but this Redne&s;s di&s;appears on pre&s;&s;ing the Spot with a Finger, and returns on removing it. The Patient feels in the Part affected a burning Heat which makes him unea&s;y, and &s;ometimes hinders him from &s;leeping. The Di&s;|order increa&s;es for the Space of two or three Days; continues at its Height one or two, and then abates. Soon after this, that Part of the Skin which was affected, falls off in pretty large Scales, and the Di&s;order entirely terminates.</P>
<P>&sect; 274. But &s;ometimes this Malady is con&s;iderably more &s;evere, beginning with a violent Shivering, which is &s;ucceeded by a burn|ing Heat, a vehement Head-ach, a Sickne&s;s at Heart, as it is commonly termed, or Reachings to vomit, which continue till the <HI>Eri&s;ipelas</HI> appears, which &s;ometimes does not happen before the &s;econd, or even the third Day. The Fever then abates, and the Sickne&s;s goes off, though frequently a le&s;s Degree of Fever, and of Sickne&s;s or Loathing remain, during the whole Time, in which the Di&s;ea&s;e is in its increa&s;ing State. When the Eruption and Inflammation happen in the Face, the Head-ach continues
<PB N="147" REF="012243_0167_0F8DFBEC4981EDF0">
until the Decline, or going off, of the Di&s;ea&s;e, The Eyelid &s;wells, the Eye is clo&s;ed, and the Patient has not the lea&s;t Ea&s;e or Tranquillity. It often pa&s;&s;es from one Cheek to the other, and extends &s;ucce&s;&s;ively over the Forehead, the Neck, and the Nape of the Neck; under which Circum&s;tance the Di&s;ea&s;e is of a more than ordinary Duration. Sometimes al&s;o when it exi&s;ts in a very high Degree, the Fever continues, the Brain is ob&s;tructed and oppre&s;&s;ed; the Patient raves; his Ca&s;e becomes extremely dan|gerous; whence &s;ometimes, if he is not very judiciou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted, he dies, e&s;pecially if of an advanced Age. A violent <HI>Eri&s;ipelas</HI> on the Neck brings on a Quin&s;ey, which may prove very grievous or even fatal.</P>
<P>When it attacks the Leg, the whole Leg &s;wells up; and the Heat and Irritation from it is extended up to the Thigh.</P>
<P>Whenever this Tumour is con&s;iderable, the Part it &s;eizes is co|vered with &s;mall Pu&s;tules filled with a clear watery Humour, re|&s;embling tho&s;e which appear after a Burn, and drying afterwards and &s;caling off. I have &s;ometimes ob&s;erved, e&s;pecially when this Di&s;temper affected the Face, that the Humour, which i&s;&s;ued from the&s;e little Pu&s;tules, was extremely thick or glewy, and formed a thick Scurf, or Scabs nearly re&s;embling tho&s;e of &s;ucking Chil|dren: they have continued fa&s;t on the Face many Days before they fell off.</P>
<P>When the Di&s;ea&s;e may be termed violent, it &s;ometimes conti|nues eight, ten, twelve Days at the &s;ame Height; and is at la&s;t terminated by a very plentiful Sweat, that may &s;ometimes be pre|dicted by a Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s attended with Shiverings, and a little Anx|iety of &s;ome Hours Duration. Throughout the Progre&s;s of the Di&s;ea&s;e, the whole Skin is very dry, and even the In&s;ide of the Mouth.</P>
<P>&sect; 275. An <HI>Eri&s;ipelas</HI> rarely comes to Suppuration, and when it does, the Suppuration is always unkindly, and much di&s;po&s;ed to degenerate into an Ulcer. Sometimes a malignant kind of <HI>E|ri&s;ipelas</HI> is epidemical, &s;eizing a great Number of Per&s;ons, and fre|quently terminating in Gangrenes.</P>
<P>&sect; 276. This Di&s;temper often &s;hifts its Situation; it &s;ometimes retires &s;uddenly; but the Patient is unea&s;y and di&s;ordered; he has a Propen&s;ity to vomit, with a &s;en&s;ible Anxiety and Heat: the <HI>Eri&s;ipelas</HI> appears again in a different Part, and he feels him&s;elf quite relieved from the preceding Symptoms. But if in&s;tead of re-appearing on &s;ome other Part of the Surface, the Humour is thrown upon the Brain, or the Brea&s;t, he dies within a few Hours; and the&s;e fatal Changes and Tran&s;lations &s;ometimes occur, without the lea&s;t Rea&s;on or Colour for a&s;cribing them either to any Error of the Patient, or of his Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>If the Humour has been transferred to the Brain, the Patient im|mediately becomes delirious, with a highly flu&s;hed Vi&s;age, and very quick &s;parkling Eyes: very &s;oon after he proves downright frantic, and goes off in a Lethargy.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="012243_0168_0F8DFBED97E5CC40">If the Lungs are attacked, the Oppre&s;&s;ion, Anxiety and Heat are inexpre&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>&sect; 277. There are &s;ome Con&s;titutions &s;ubject to a very frequent, and, as it were, to an habitual <HI>Eri&s;ipelas.</HI> If it often affects the Face, it is generally repeated on the &s;ame Side of it; and that Eye is, at length, con&s;iderably weakened by it.</P>
<P>&sect; 278. This Di&s;temper re&s;ults from two Cau&s;es; the one an a|crid &s;harp Humour, which is commonly bilious, diffu&s;ed through the Ma&s;s of Blood; the other con&s;i&s;ts in that Humour's not being &s;ufficiently di&s;charged by Per&s;piration.</P>
<P>&sect; 279. When this Di&s;ea&s;e is of a gentle Nature, &s;uch as it is de&s;cribed &sect; 273, it will be &s;ufficient to keep up a very free Per|&s;piration, but without heating the Patient; and the be&s;t Method to an&s;wer this Purpo&s;e is putting him upon the Regimen &s;o often already referred to, with a plentiful U&s;e of Nitre in Elder-flower Tea. Fle&s;h, Eggs and Wine are prohibited of cour&s;e, allowing the Patient a little Puls and ripe Fruits. He &s;hould drink El|der-flower Tea abundantly, and take half a Drachm of Nitre e|very three Hours; or, which amounts to the &s;ame thing, let three Drachms of Nitre be di&s;&s;olved in as much Infu&s;ion of Elder-flowers, as he can drink in twenty-four Hours. Nitre may be given too in a Bolus with Con&s;erve of Elder-berries. The&s;e Medicines keep the Body open, and increa&s;e Urine and Per&s;piration.</P>
<P>&sect; 280. When the Di&s;temper prevails in a &s;everer Degree, if the Fever is very high, and the Pul&s;e, at the &s;ame time, &s;trong or hard, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to bleed once: but this &s;hould never be permitted in a large Quantity at a time in this Di&s;ea&s;e; it being more advi&s;eable, if a &s;ufficient Quantity has not been taken at once, to bleed a &s;econd time, and even a third, if the Fever &s;hould prove very high, as it often does, and that &s;ome|times in &s;o violent a Degree, as to render it extremely danger|ous; and in a few &s;uch Ca&s;es Nature has &s;ometimes &s;aved the Patients by effecting a large Haemorrhage, or Bleeding, to the Quantity of four or five Pounds. This Conduct a very intelli|gent and prudent Phy&s;ician may pre&s;ume to imitate; but I dare not advi&s;e the &s;ame Conduct to that Cla&s;s of Phy&s;icians, for which only I write: it being &s;afer for them to u&s;e repeated Bleed|ings in &s;uch Ca&s;es, than one in an exce&s;&s;ive Quantity. The&s;e e|ri&s;ipelatous Fevers are often excited by a Per&s;on's being too long over-heated.</P>
<P>After Bleeding the Patient is to be re&s;trained to his Regimen; Gly&s;ters are to be given until there is a &s;en&s;ible Abatement of the Fever: and he &s;hould drink the Barley Water freely, No. 3.</P>
<P>When the Fever is &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed, either the Purge No. 23 &s;hould be given, or a few Do&s;es of Cream of Tartar No. 24, every Morning. Purging is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to carry off the &s;tagnant Bile, which is generally the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of the violent Degrees of this Di&s;temper. It may &s;ometimes be really nece&s;&s;ary too, if the Di&s;ea&s;e is very tedious; if the Loathing and Sickne&s;s
<PB N="149" REF="012243_0169_0F8DFBEE792F34B8">
at Stomach is ob&s;tinate; the Mouth ill-&s;avoured, and the Tongue foul, (provided there be only a &s;light Fever, and no Fear of an Inflammation) to give the Medicines No. 34 or 35, which, in Con|&s;equence of the Agitation, the Shaking they occa&s;ion, remove the&s;e Impediments &s;till better than Purges.</P>
<P>It commonly happens that this Di&s;ea&s;e is more favourable after the&s;e Evacuations; neverthele&s;s it is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to re|peat them the next Day, or the next but one; e&s;pecially if the Malady affects the Head. Purging is the true Evacuation for curing it, whenever it attacks this Part. By carrying off the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, they dimini&s;h it, and prevent its wor&s;t E|vents.</P>
<P>Whenever, even after the&s;e Evacuations, the Fever &s;till conti|nues to be very &s;evere, the Patient &s;hould take every two Hours, or, occa&s;ionally, oftner, two Spoonfuls of the Pre&s;cription No. 10, added to a Gla&s;s of Pti&s;an.</P>
<P>It will be very u&s;eful, when this Di&s;ea&s;e is &s;eated in the Head or Face, to bath the Legs frequently in warm Water; and, where it is violent there, al&s;o to apply Sinapi&s;ms to the Soles of the Feet. I have &s;een this Application, in about four Hours at|tract, or draw down an <HI>Eri&s;ipelas</HI> to the Legs, which had &s;pread over the No&s;e, and both the Eyes. When the Di&s;temper once begins to go off by Sweating, this &s;hould be promoted by Elder-flower Tea and Nitre (See &sect; 279) and the Sweating may be en|couraged to Advantage for &s;ome Hours.</P>
<P>&sect; 281. The be&s;t Applications that can be made to the affected Part are 1&s;t, The Herb Robert, a Species of <HI>Geranium,</HI> or Crane's Bill; or Chervil, or Par&s;ley, or Elder Flowers: and if the Com|plaint be of a very mild Di&s;po&s;ition, it may be &s;ufficient to ap|ply a very &s;oft &s;mooth Linen over it, which &s;ome People du&s;t o|ver with a little dry Meal.</P>
<P>2, If there is a very con&s;iderable Inflammation, and the Pa|tient is &s;o circum&s;tanced as to be very tractable and is regularly at|tended, Flanels wrung out of a &s;trong Decoction of Elder-flowers and applied warm, afford him the &s;peedie&s;t Ea&s;e and Relief. By this &s;imple Application I have appea&s;ed the mo&s;t violent Pains of a St. Anthony's Fire, which is the mo&s;t cruel Species of an <HI>Eri&s;i|pelas,</HI> and has &s;ome peculiar Marks or Symptoms extraordinary.</P>
<P>3, The Plai&s;ter of Smalt, and Smalt it&s;elf No. 46, are al&s;o very &s;ucce&s;sfully employed in this Di&s;order. This Powder, the farina|cious, that is the mealy ones, or others recommended for it, a|gree be&s;t when a thin watery Humour di&s;tils or weeps from the li|tle Ve&s;ications attending it, which it is convenient to ab&s;orb by &s;uch Applications; without which Precaution this Humour might gall, or even ulcerate, the Part.</P>
<P>All other Plai&s;ters, which are partly compounded of grea&s;y, or of re&s;inous Sub&s;tances, are very dangerous: they often repel, or &s;trike in the <HI>Eri&s;ipelas,</HI> occa&s;ioning it to ulcerate, or even to gan|grene. If People who are naturally &s;ubject to this Di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould
<PB N="150" REF="012243_0170_0F8DFBEF292128D8">
apply any &s;uch Plai&s;ter to their Skin, even in its &s;ounde&s;t State, an <HI>Eri&s;ipelas</HI> is the &s;peedy Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>&sect; 282. Whenever the Humour occa&s;ioning the Di&s;temper is re|pelled, and thrown upon the Brain, the Throat, the Lungs, or any internal Part, the Patient &s;hould be bled; Bli&s;ters mu&s;t be applied to the Legs; and Elder Tea, with Nitre di&s;&s;olved in it, &s;hould be plentifully drank.</P>
<P>&sect; 283. People who are liable to frequent Returns of an <HI>Eri&s;ipe|las,</HI> &s;hould very carefully avoid u&s;ing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;hould think it would not always be nece&s;&s;ary to extend this Re&s;triction to fre&s;h clarified Whey; e&s;pecially if a &s;mall Quantity of the Leaves of Wood-Sor|rel, or of <HI>French</HI> Sorrel, had been infu&s;ed &s;ometime in it; or if the Milk had been turned with the Juice of a good ripe Lemon.

<HEAD>CHAPTER XX. Of &s;purious, or fal&s;e Inflammations of the Brea&s;t, and of &s;purious, bilious Pleuri&s;ies.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 285. THE Inflammation of the Brea&s;t and that Pleuri&s;y, which is called <HI>bilious,</HI> are the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e. It is properly a putrid Fever, attended with an Infarction or Stuffing of the Lungs, though without Pain; in which Circum&s;tance it is called a putrid or bilious Peripneumony: but when attended with a Pain of the Side, a Stitch, it is called a &s;purious or ba&s;tard Pleuri&s;y.</P>
<P>&sect; 286. The Signs which di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es from the in|flammatory ones of the &s;ame Name, de&s;cribed Chap. IV and V, are a le&s;s hard and le&s;s &s;trong, but a quicker Pul&s;e, though un|accompanied with the &s;ame Symptoms which con&s;titute the inflam|matory ones, (See &sect; 47 and 90.) The Mouth is foul, and has a Sen&s;ation of Bitterne&s;s; the Patient is infe&s;ted with a &s;harp and dry Heat; he has a Feeling of Heavine&s;s and Anxiety all about
<PB N="152" REF="012243_0172_0F8DFBF0ADA17CF0">
his Stomach, with Loathings: he is le&s;s flu&s;hed and red in the&s;e, than in the inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;es, but rather a little yellow. He has a dejected wan Look; his Urine re&s;embles that in putrid Fe|vers, and not that of inflammatory ones; and he has very often a &s;mall bilious Loo&s;ene&s;s, which is extremely offen&s;ive. The Skin is commonly very dry in this Di&s;ea&s;e; the Humour &s;pit up is le&s;s thick, le&s;s reddi&s;h, and rather more yellow, than in the in|flammatory Di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;ame Names.</P>
<P>&sect; 287. The&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t be treated like putrid Fevers, as in &sect; 241. Suppo&s;ing &s;ome little Degree of Inflammation to be com|bined with the Di&s;ea&s;e, it may be removed by a &s;ingle Bleeding. After this the Patient is to drink Barley Water No. 3, to make U&s;e of Gly&s;ters; and as &s;oon as all Symptoms of any Inflamma|tion wholly di&s;appear, he is to take the vomiting and purging Draught No. 34. But the utmo&s;t Caution mu&s;t be taken not to give it, before every Appearance of any Inflammation is totally re|moved; as giving it &s;ooner would be certain Death to the &s;ick: and it is dreadful but to think of agitating, by a Vomit, Lungs that are inflamed, and overloaded with Blood, who&s;e Ve&s;&s;els bur&s;t and di&s;charge them&s;elves, only from the Force of Expecto|ration. After an Interval of &s;ome Days, he may be purged again with the Medicine No. 23. The Pre&s;cription No. 25 &s;ucceeds al|&s;o very well as a Vomit. If the Fever is violent, he mu&s;t drink plentifully of the Potion No. 10.</P>
<P>Bli&s;ters to the Legs are very &s;erviceable, when the Load and Oppre&s;&s;ion are not con&s;iderably abated after general Evacuations.</P>
<P>&sect; 288. The fal&s;e Inflammation of the Brea&s;t is an Over-fulne&s;s or Ob&s;truction in the Lungs, accompanied with a Fever; it is cau&s;ed by extremely thick and tenacious Humours: and not by a really inflammatory Blood, or by any putrid or bilious Humour.</P>
<P>&sect; 289. This Di&s;temper happens more frequently in the Spring, than in any other Sea&s;on. Old Men, puny, ill-con&s;titutioned Chil|dren, languid Women, feeble young Men, and particularly &s;uch as have worn their Con&s;titutions out by drinking, are the Subjects mo&s;t frequently attacked by it; e&s;pecially if they have u&s;ed but little Exerci&s;e throughout the Winter; if they have fed on vi&s;cid, mealy and fat Aliments, as Pa&s;try, Che&s;nuts, thick Milk or Pap, and Chee&s;e. All their Humours have contracted a thick glutinous Quality; they are circulated with Difficulty, and when Heat or Exerci&s;e in the Spring increa&s;es their Motion at once, the Hu|mours already &s;tuffing up the Lungs, &s;till more augment that Ple|nitude, whence the&s;e vital Organs are fatally extended, and the Patient dies.</P>
<P>&sect; 290. This Di&s;temper is known to exi&s;t,</P>
<P>1, By the previous Exi&s;tence of the Cau&s;es already mentioned.</P>
<P>2, By the Symptoms which precede and u&s;her it in: For Ex|ample, the Patient many Days before-hand has a &s;light Cough; a &s;mall Oppre&s;&s;ion when he moves about; a little Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and is &s;ometimes a little choleric or fretful. His Countenance is high|er
<PB N="153" REF="012243_0173_0F8DFBF16D4E30B8">
coloured than in Health; he has a Propen&s;ity to &s;leep, but at|tended with Confu&s;ion and without Refre&s;hment, and has &s;ome|times an extraordinary Appetite.</P>
<P>3, When this State has continued for &s;ome Days, there comes on a cold Shivering, though more con&s;iderable for its Duration than its Violence; it is &s;ucceeded by a moderate Degree of Heat; but that attended with much Inquietude and Oppre&s;&s;ion. The &s;ick Per&s;on cannot confine him&s;elf to the Bed; but walks to and fro in his Chamber, and is greatly dejected. The Pul&s;e is weak and pretty quick; the Urine is &s;ometimes but little changed from that in Health; at other times it is di&s;charged but in a &s;mall Quantity, and is higher coloured: he coughs but mode|rately, and does not expectorate, or cough up, but with Difficul|ty. The Vi&s;age becomes very red, and even almo&s;t livid; he can neither keep awake, nor &s;leep well; he raves for &s;ome Moments, and then his Head grows clear again. Sometimes it happens, e&s;|pecially to Per&s;ons of advanced Age, that this State &s;uddenly terminates in a mortal Swoon or Fainting: at other times and in other Ca&s;es, the Oppre&s;&s;ion and Angui&s;h increa&s;e; the Patient cannot breathe but when &s;itting up, and that with great Difficul|ty and Agony: the Brain is utterly di&s;turbed and embarra&s;&s;ed; this State la&s;ts for &s;ome Hours, and then terminates of a &s;udden.</P>
<P>&sect; 291. This is a very dangerous Di&s;temper; becau&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, it chiefly attacks tho&s;e Per&s;ons who&s;e Temperament and Con&s;titution are deprived of the ordinary Re&s;ources for Health and Recovery: in the &s;econd place, becau&s;e it is of a pre|cipitate Nature, the Patient &s;ometimes dying on the third Day, and but &s;eldom &s;urviving the &s;eventh; while the Cau&s;e of it re|quires a more con&s;iderable Term for its Removal, or Mitigation. Be&s;ides which, if &s;ome Indications pre&s;ent, for the Employment of a Remedy, there are frequently others which forbid it; and all that &s;eems to be done is, as follows;</P>
<P>1, If the Patient has &s;till a pretty good Share of Health; if he is not of too advanced an Age; if the Pul&s;e has a perceivable Hardne&s;s, and yet at the &s;ame time &s;ome Strength; if the Wea|ther is dry, and the Wind blows from the North, he &s;hould be bled once, to a moderate Quantity. But if the greater Part of the&s;e Circum&s;tances are wanting, Bleeding would be very preju|dicial. Were we obliged to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome general and po&s;itive Rule in this Ca&s;e, it were better to exclude Bleeding, than to ad|mit it.</P>
<P>2, The Stomach and the Bowels &s;hould be unloaded from their vi&s;cid glutinous Contents; and the Medicines which &s;ucceed the be&s;t in this Re&s;pect are No. 35, when the Symptoms &s;hew there is a great Nece&s;&s;ity for vomiting, and there is no Inflammation; or the Pre&s;cription No. 25, which after vomiting, purges by Stool, promotes Urine, breaks down and divides the vi&s;cid Humours, that occa&s;ion the Di&s;ea&s;e, and increa&s;es Per&s;piration. When we are afraid of hazarding the Agitations of a Vomit and its Con|&s;equences,
<PB N="154" REF="012243_0174_0F8DFBF22D237738">
the Potion, No. 11 may be given; but we mu&s;t be very cautious, in Regard to old Men, even with this; as &s;uch may expire during the Operation of it.</P>
<P>3, They &s;hould, from the Beginning of the Di&s;ea&s;e, drink plentifully of the Pti&s;an No. 26, which is the be&s;t Drink in this Di&s;ea&s;e; or that of No. 12, adding half a Dram of Nitre to every Pint of it.</P>
<P>4, A Cup of the Mature No. 8 mu&s;t be taken every two Hours.</P>
<P>5, Bli&s;ters are to be applied to the In&s;ides of the Legs.</P>
<P>When the Ca&s;e is very doubtful and perplexing, it were be&s;t to confine our&s;elves to the three la&s;t-mentioned Remedies, which have often been &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;evere Degrees of this Di&s;ea&s;e; and which can occa&s;ion no ill Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>&sect; 292. When this Malady invades old People, though they partly recover, they never recover perfectly, entirely, from it: and if due Precaution is not taken, they are very liable to fall into a Drop&s;y of the Brea&s;t after it.</P>
<P>&sect; 293. The &s;purious or fal&s;e Pleuri&s;y is a Di&s;temper that does not affect the Lungs, but only the Teguments, the Skin, and the Mu&s;cles which cover the Ribs. It is the Effect of a Rheumatic Humour thrown upon the&s;e Parts, in which, as it produces very &s;harp Pains re&s;embling that which is called a <HI>Stitch,</HI> it has, from this Circum&s;tance, been termed a Pleuri&s;y.</P>
<P>It is generally &s;uppo&s;ed by the meer Multitude, and even by &s;ome of a different Rank, that a fal&s;e Pleuri&s;y is more dangerous than a genuine, a true one; but this is a Mi&s;take. It is often u&s;hered in by a Shivering, and almo&s;t ever attended with a little Fever, a &s;mall Cough, and a &s;light Difficulty of breathing; which, as well as the Cough, is occa&s;ioned from the Circum&s;tance of a Patient's (who feels Pain in Re&s;piration, or Breathing) checking Breathing as much as he can; this accumulates a little too much Blood in the Lungs; but yet he has no Angui&s;h, not the other Symptoms of acute true Pleuri&s;ies. In &s;ome Patients this Pain is extended, almo&s;t over the whole Brea&s;t, and to the Nape of the Neck. The &s;ick Per&s;on cannot repo&s;e him&s;elf on the Side affected.</P>
<P>This Di&s;order is not more dangerous than a Rheumati&s;m, ex|cept in two Ca&s;es, 1, When the Pain is &s;o very &s;evere, that the Patient &s;trongly endeavours not to breathe at all, which brings on a great Infarction or Stoppage in the Lungs. 2, When this Hu|mour, like any other rheumatic one, is transferred to &s;ome inter|nal Part.</P>
<P>&sect; 294. It mu&s;t be treated exactly like a Rheumati&s;m. See &sect; 168 and 169.</P>
<P>After bleeding once or more, a Bli&s;ter applied to the affected Part is often attended with a very good Effect: this being indeed the Kind of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Seneka Rattle-&s;nake-root, already recommended in true Pleuri&s;ies, will, with the greate&s;t Probability, be found not le&s;s effectual in the&s;e fal&s;e ones, in which the Inflammation of the Blood is le&s;s. The Method of giving it may be &s;een P. 58, N. (a.)

This Malady &s;ometimes gives way to the fir&s;t Bleeding; often terminating on the third, fourth or fifth Day, by a very plentiful Sweat, and rarely la&s;ting beyond the &s;eventh. Some|times it attacks a Per&s;on very &s;uddenly, after a Stoppage of Per|&s;piration; and then, if at once, before the Fever commences, and has had time to inflame the Blood, the Patient takes &s;ome <HI>Fal|trank,</HI> it effects a &s;peedy Cure by re&s;toring Per&s;piration. They are &s;uch Ca&s;es as the&s;e, or that mentioned &sect; 96, which have given this Compo&s;ition the Reputation it has obtained in this Di&s;ea&s;e; a Reputation neverthele&s;s, which has every Year proved tragical in its Con&s;equences to many Pea&s;ants, who being deceived by &s;ome mi&s;leading Re&s;emblances in this Di&s;temper, have ra&s;hly and ignorantly made U&s;e of it in true inflammatory Pleuri&s;ies.</P>

<PB N="156" REF="012243_0176_0F8DFBF3B9873FC8">
the Inte&s;tines. It begins mo&s;t commonly without any Shivering, by a vehement Pain in the Belly, which gradually becomes &s;till more &s;o. The Pul&s;e grows quick and hard; a burning Pain is felt through the whole Region of the Belly; &s;ometimes there is a watery <HI>Diarrhoea,</HI> or Purging; at other Times the Belly is ra|ther co&s;tive, which is attended with Vomiting, a very embarra&s;|&s;ing and dangerous Symptom: the Countenance becomes highly flu&s;hed; the Belly ten&s;e and hard; neither can it be touched &s;carcely without a cruel Augmentation of the Patient's Pain, who is al&s;o afflicted with extreme Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s; his Thir&s;t is very great, being unquenchable by Drink; the Pain often extends to the Loins, where it proves very &s;harp, and &s;evere; little Urine is made, and that very red, and with a Kind of burning Heat. The tormented Patient has not a Moment's Re&s;t, and now and then raves a little. If the Di&s;ea&s;e is not removed or moderated, before the Pains ri&s;e to their utmo&s;t Height and Violence, the Pa|tient begins at length to complain le&s;s; the Pul&s;e becomes le&s;s &s;trong and le&s;s hard than before, but quicker; his Face fir&s;t abates of its Flu&s;h and Redne&s;s, and &s;oon after looks pale; the Parts under the Eyes become livid; the Patient &s;inks into a low &s;tupid Kind of <HI>Delirium,</HI> or Raving; his Strength entirely de&s;erts him; the Face, Hands, Feet, and the whole Body, the Belly only ex|cepted, become cold: the Surface of the Belly appears blui&s;h; extreme Weakne&s;s follows, and the Patient dies. There fre|quently occurs, ju&s;t a Moment before he expires, an abundant Di&s;charge of exce&s;&s;ively foetid Matter by Stool; and during this Evacuation he dies, with his Inte&s;tines quite gangrened, or mor|tified.</P>
<P>When the Di&s;temper a&s;&s;aults the Stomach, the Symptoms are the very &s;ame, but the Pain is felt higher up, at the Pit of the Stomach. Almo&s;t every Thing that is &s;wallowed is ca&s;t up again; the Angui&s;h of the tortured Patient is terrible, and the Raving comes on very &s;peedily. This Di&s;ea&s;e, proves mortal in a few Hours.</P>
<P>&sect; 298. The only Method of &s;ucceeding in the Cure of it is as follows:</P>
<P>1, Take a very large Quantity of Blood from the Arm; this almo&s;t immediately dimini&s;hes the Violence of the Pains, and al|lays the Vomiting; be&s;ides its contributing to the greater Suc|ce&s;s of the other Remedies. It is often nece&s;&s;ary to repeat this Bleed|ing within the Space of two Hours.</P>
<P>2, Whether the Patient has a Loo&s;ene&s;s, or has not, a Gly&s;ter of a Decoction of Mallows, or of Barley Water and Oil, &s;hould be given every two Hours.</P>
<P>3, The Patient &s;hould drink very plentifully of Almond Milk No. 4; or a Pti&s;an of Mallow Flowers, or of Barley, all which &s;hould be warm.</P>
<P>4, Flanels dipt in hot, or very warm Water, &s;hould be conti|nually
<PB N="157" REF="012243_0177_0F8DFBF71B35FCF8">
applied over the Belly, &s;hifting them every Hour, or rather oftner; for in this Ca&s;e they very quickly grow dry.</P>
<P>5, If the Di&s;ea&s;e, notwith&s;tanding all this, continues very ob|&s;tinate and violent, the Patient &s;hould be put into a warm Water Bath, the extraordinary Succe&s;s of which I have ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>When the Di&s;temper is over, that is to &s;ay, when the Pains have terminated, and the Fever has cea&s;ed, &s;o that the Patient recovers a little Strength, and gets a little Sleep, it will be proper to give him a Purge, but a very gentle one. Two Ounces of Manna, and a Quarter of an Ounce of Sedlitz <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Glauber or Ep&s;om Salt may be &s;ub&s;tituted, where the other is not readily to be procured. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> Salt di&s;&s;olved in a Gla&s;s of clear Whey are generally &s;ufficient, at this Period, to purge the mo&s;t robu&s;t and hardy Bodies. Manna alone may &s;uf|fice for more delicate Con&s;titutions: as all acri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;harp Purges would be highly dangerous, with Regard to the great Sen&s;ibility and tender Condition of the Stomach and of the Inte&s;tines, after this Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; 299. It is &s;ometimes the Effect of a general Inflammation of the Blood; and is produced, like other inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;es, by extraordinary Labour, very great Heat, heating Meats or Drinks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is often the Con&s;equence of other Cholics which have been injudiciou&s;ly treated, and which otherwi&s;e would not have degene|rated into inflammatory ones; as I have many times &s;een the&s;e Cholics introduced after the u&s;e of heating Medicines; one In|&s;tance of which may be &s;een &sect; 164.</P>
<P>&sect; 300. Ten Days after I had recovered a Woman out of a &s;e|vere Cholic, the Pains returned violently in the Night. She, &s;up|po&s;ing them to ari&s;e only from Wind, hoped to appea&s;e them by drinking a deal of di&s;tilled Walnut water; which, far from pro|ducing any &s;uch Effect, rendered them more outrageous. They were &s;oon heightened to a &s;urpri&s;ing Degree, which might rea|&s;onably be expected. Being &s;ent for very early in the Morning. I found her Pul&s;e hard, quick, &s;hort; her Belly was ten&s;e and hard; &s;he complained greatly of her Loins; her Urine was al|mo&s;t entirely &s;topt. She pa&s;t but a few Drops, which felt as it were &s;calding hot, and the&s;e with exce&s;&s;ive Pain. She went very frequently to the Clo&s;e-&s;tool, with &s;carcely any Effect; her An|gui&s;h, Heat, Thir&s;t, and the Dryne&s;s of her Tongue were even terrifying; and her wretched State, the Effect of the &s;trong hot Liquor &s;he had taken, made me very apprehen&s;ive for her. One Bleeding, to the Quantity of fourteen Ounces, &s;omewhat abated all the Pains; &s;he took &s;everal Gly&s;ters, and drank off a few Pots of <HI>Orgeat</HI> in a few Hours. By the&s;e Means the Di&s;ea&s;e was a little mitigated; by continuing the &s;ame Drink and the Gly&s;ters the Loo&s;ene&s;s abated; the Pain of the Loins went off, and &s;he pa&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable Quantity of Urine, which proved turbid, and then
<PB N="158" REF="012243_0178_0F8DFBF8863BB7E8">
letting fall a Sediment, the Patient recovered, Neverthele&s;s I verily believe, if the Bleeding had been delayed two Hours longer, this &s;pirituous Walnut Water would have been the Death of her. During the Progre&s;s of this violent Di&s;ea&s;e, no Food is to be al|lowed; and we &s;hould never be too inattentive to &s;uch Degrees of Pain, as &s;ometimes remain after their Severity is over; le&s;t a <HI>Schirrus,</HI> an inward hard Tumour, &s;hould be generated, which may occa&s;ion the mo&s;t inveterate and tedious Maladies.</P>
<P>&sect; 301. An Inflammation of the Inte&s;tines, and one of the Sto|mach, may al&s;o terminate in an Ab&s;ce&s;s, like an Inflammation of any other Part; and it may be apprehended that one is forming, when, though the Violence of the Pain abates, there &s;till remains a &s;low, obtu&s;e, heavy Pain, with general Inquietude, little Ap|petite, frequent Shiverings; the Patient at the &s;ame time not re|covering any Strength. In &s;uch Ca&s;es the Patient &s;hould be al|lowed no other Drinks, but what are already directed in this Chapter, and &s;ome Soops made of Puls, or other farinaceous Food.</P>
<P>The Breaking of the Ab&s;ce&s;s may &s;ometimes be di&s;covered by a &s;light Swoon or fainting Fit; attended with a perceivable Ce&s;&s;a|tion of a Weight or Heavine&s;s in the Part, where it was lately felt: and when the <HI>Pus,</HI> or ripe Matter, is effu&s;ed into the Gut, the Patient &s;ometimes has Reachings to vomit, a <HI>Vertigo,</HI> or Swim|ming in the Head, and the Matter appears in the next Stools. In this Ca&s;e there remains an Ulcer within the Gut, which, if either neglected, or improperly treated, may pave the Way to a &s;low wa&s;ting Fever, and even to Death. Yet this I have cured by mak|ing the Patient live &s;olely upon &s;kimmed Milk, diluted with one third Part Water, and by giving every other Day a Gly&s;ter, con|&s;i&s;ting of equal Parts of Milk and Water, with the Addition of a little Honey.</P>
<P>When the Ab&s;ce&s;s breaks on the Out&s;ide of the Gut, and di&s;|charges its Contents into the Cavity of the Belly, it becomes a very mi&s;erable Ca&s;e, and demands &s;uch further A&s;&s;i&s;tance as cannot be particularized here.</P>

<HEAD>Of the bilious Cholic.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 302. The bilious Cholic di&s;covers it&s;elf by very acute Pains, but is &s;eldom accompanied with a Fever; at lea&s;t not until it has la&s;ted a Day or two. And even if there &s;hould be &s;ome Degree of a Fever, yet the Pul&s;e, though quick, is neither &s;trong nor hard: the Belly is neither ten&s;e or &s;tretched as it were, nor burning hot, as in the former Cholic; the Urine comes away with more Ea&s;e, and is le&s;s high-coloured. Neverthele&s;s the inward Heat and Thir&s;t are con&s;iderable; the Mouth is bitter; the Vomiting or Purging, when either of them attend it, di&s;charges a yellowi&s;h Humour or Excrement; and the Patient's Head is often vertigi|nous or dizzy.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="012243_0179_0F8DFBF95CACCE18">&sect; 303. The Method of curing this is,</P>
<P>1, By injecting Gly&s;ters of Whey and Honey; or, if Whey is not readily procurable, by repeating the Gly&s;ter No. 5.</P>
<P>2, By making the Sick drink con&s;iderably of the &s;ame Whey, or of a Pti&s;an made of the Root of Dog's-Gra&s;s (the common Gra&s;s) and a little Juice of Lemon; for want of which a little Vinegar and Honey may be &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pullet, or rather chicken Water, but very weak, may often do in&s;tead of Pti&s;an, or &s;erve for a little Variety of Drink to &s;ome Patients. <HI>E. L.</HI>&mdash;K.</NOTE></P>
<P>3, By giving every Hour one Cup of the Medicine No. 32; or, where this is not to be had, half a Drachm of Cream of Tartar at the &s;ame &s;hort Intervals.</P>
<P>4, Fomentations of warm Water and Half-baths are al&s;o very proper.</P>
<P>5, If the Pains are &s;harp and violent, in a robu&s;t &s;trong Per&s;on, and the Pul&s;e is &s;trong and ten&s;e, Bleeding &s;hould be u&s;ed to pre|vent an Inflammation.</P>
<P>6, No other Nouri&s;hment &s;hould be given, except &s;ome maigre Soops, made from Vegetables, and particularly from Sorrel.</P>
<P>7, After plentiful Dilution with the proper Drink, if no Fever &s;upervenes; if the Pains &s;till continue, and the Patient di&s;charges but little by Stool, he &s;hould take a moderate Purge. That di|rected No. 47 is a very proper one.</P>
<P>&sect; 304. This bilious Cholic is habitual to many Per&s;ons; and may be prevented or greatly mitigated by an habitual U&s;e of the Powder No. 24; by &s;ubmitting to a moderate Retrenchment in the Article of Fle&s;h-meat; and by avoiding heating and grea&s;y Food, and the U&s;e of Milk.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Cholics from Indige&s;tions, and of Indige&s;tion.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 305. Under this Appellation I comprehend all tho&s;e Cholics, which are either owing to any overloading Quantity of Food ta|ken at once; or to a Ma&s;s or Accumulation of Aliments formed by Degrees in &s;uch Stomachs, as dige&s;t but very imperfectly; or which re&s;ult from noxious Mixtures of Aliment in the Stomach, &s;uch as that of Milk and Acids; or from Food either not whole|&s;ome in its &s;elf, or degenerated into an unwhole&s;ome Condition.</P>
<P>This Kind of Cholic may be known from any of the&s;e Cau&s;es having preceded it; by its Pains, which are accompanied with great Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and come on by Degrees, being le&s;s fixed than in the Cholics before treated of. The&s;e Cholics are al&s;o without any Fever, Heat, or Thir&s;t, but accompanied with a Giddine&s;s of the Head, and Efforts to vomit, and rather with a pale, than a high-coloured Vi&s;age.</P>
<P>&sect; 306. The&s;e Di&s;orders, from the&s;e la&s;t Cau&s;es, are &s;carcely e|ver dangerous in them&s;elves; but may be made &s;uch by injudici|ous
<PB N="160" REF="012243_0180_0F8DFBF9B7086100">
Management, and doing more than is nece&s;&s;ary or proper: as the only thing to be done is, to promote the Di&s;charges by warm Drinks. There are a con&s;iderable Variety of them, which &s;eem equally good, &s;uch as warm Water, or even cold Water with a Toa&s;t, with the Addition either of a little Sugar, or a little Salt: a light Infu&s;ion of Camomile, or of Elder-flowers, common Tea, or Baum, it imports little which, provided the Patient drink plen|tifully of them: in Con&s;equence of which the offending Matter is di&s;charged, either by vomiting, or a con&s;iderable purging; and the &s;peedier and more in Quantity the&s;e Di&s;charges are, the &s;oo|ner the Patient is relieved.</P>
<P>If the Belly is remarkably full and co&s;tive, Gly&s;ters of warm Wa|ter and Salt &s;hould be injected.</P>
<P>The Expul&s;ion of the ob&s;tructing Matter is al&s;o facilitated, by rubbing the Belly heartily with hot Cloths.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Humours, or other retained Contents of the Bel|ly, are more pernicious from their Quality, than their Quantity; and then the Malady may be di&s;&s;ipated without the former Di&s;|charges, by the irritating &s;harp Humour being diluted, or even drowned, as it were, in the Abundance of &s;mall watery Drinks. When the Pains invade fir&s;t in the Stomach, they become le&s;s &s;harp, and the Patient feels le&s;s Inquietude, as &s;oon as the Cau&s;e of the Pain has de&s;cended out of the Stomach into the Inte&s;tines, who&s;e Sen&s;ations are &s;omething le&s;s acute than, or &s;omewhat dif|ferent from, tho&s;e of the Stomach.</P>
<P>It is often found that after the&s;e plentiful Di&s;charges, and when the Pains are over, there remains a very di&s;agreeable Ta&s;t in the Mouth, re&s;embling the Savour of rotten Eggs. This may be re|moved by giving &s;ome Do&s;es of the Powder No. 24, and drink|ing largely of good Water:</P>
<P>It is an e&s;&s;ential Point in the&s;e Ca&s;es to take no Food, before a perfect Recovery.</P>
<P>&sect; 307. Some have been ab&s;urd enough in them, to fly at once to &s;ome heating Cordial Confection, to Venice Treacle, Ani&s;eed Water, Geneva, or red Wine to &s;top the&s;e Evacuations; but there cannot be a more fatal Practice: &s;ince the&s;e Evacuations are the only thing which can cure the Complaint, and to &s;top them is to deprive the Per&s;on, who was in Danger of drowning, of the Plank which might &s;ave him. Nay, &s;hould this Endeavour of &s;topping them unhappily &s;ucceed, the Patient is either throws into a putrid Fever, or &s;ome chronical tedious Malady; unle&s;s Na|ture, much wi&s;er than &s;uch a mi&s;erable A&s;&s;i&s;tant, &s;hould prevail over the Ob&s;tacles oppo&s;ed to her Recovery, and re&s;tore the ob|&s;tructed Evacuations by her own Oeconomy, in the Space of a few Days.</P>
<P>&sect; 308. Sometimes an Indige&s;tion happens with very little Pain or Cholic, but with violent Reachings to vomit, inexpre&s;&s;ible An|gui&s;h, Faintings, and cold Sweats: and not &s;eldom al&s;o the Ma|lady begins, only with a very &s;udden and unexpected Fainting:
<PB N="161" REF="012243_0181_0F8DFBFA6D88C4D0">
the Patient immediately lo&s;es all his Sen&s;es, his Face is pale and wan: he has &s;ome Hiccups rather than Reachings to vomit, which joined to the Smallne&s;s of his Pul&s;e, to the Ea&s;ine&s;s of his re&s;piring or breathing, and to the Circum&s;tance of his being at|tacked immediately, or very &s;oon, after a Meal, makes this Di&s;|order di&s;tingui&s;hable from a real Apoplexy. Neverthele&s;s, when it ri&s;es to this Height, with the&s;e terrible Symptoms, it &s;ome|times kills in a few Hours. The fir&s;t thing to be done is to throw up a &s;harp Gly&s;ter, in which Salt and Soap are to be di&s;&s;olved; next to get down as much Salt and Water as he can &s;wallow; and if that is ineffectual, the Powder No. 34 is to be di&s;&s;olved in three Cups of Water; one half of which is to be given directly; and, if it does not operate in a Quarter of an Hour, the other half. Generally &s;peaking the Patient's Sen&s;e begins to return, as &s;oon as he begins to vomit.</P>

<HEAD>Of the flatulent or windy Cholic.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 309. Every Particular which con&s;titutes our Food, whether &s;olid or liquid, contains much Air, but &s;ome of them more than others. If they do not dige&s;t &s;oon enough, or but badly, which occa&s;ions a &s;en&s;ible E&s;cape of &s;uch Air; if they are &s;uch as con|tain an extraordinary Quantity of Air; or if the Guts being &s;traitened or compre&s;&s;ed any where in the Cour&s;e of their Extent, prevent that Air from being equally diffu&s;ed (which mu&s;t occa&s;ion a greater Proportion of it in &s;ome Places) then the Stomach and the Guts are di&s;tended by this Wind; and this Di&s;tention occa&s;i|ons the&s;e Pains, which are called flatulent, or windy.</P>
<P>This Sort of Cholic rarely appears alone and &s;imple; but is of|ten complicated with, or added, as it were, to the other Sorts, of which it is a Con&s;equence; and is more e&s;pecially joined with the Cholic from Indige&s;tions, who&s;e Symptoms it multiplies and heightens. It may be known, like that, by the Cau&s;es which have preceded it, by its not being accompanied either with Fever, Heat, or Thir&s;t; the Belly's being large and full, though without Hardne&s;s, being unequal in its Largene&s;s, which prevails more in one Part of it, than in another, forming &s;omething like Pockets of Wind, &s;ometimes in one Part, &s;ometimes in another; and by the Patient's feeling &s;ome Ea&s;e, merely from the rubbing of his Belly, as it moves the Wind about; which e&s;caping either up|wards or downwards affords him &s;till a greater Relief.</P>
<P>&sect; 310. When it is combined with any different Species of the Cholic, it requires no di&s;tinct Treatment from that Species; and it is removed or di&s;&s;ipated by the Medicines which cure the princi|pal Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Sometimes however it does happen to exi&s;t alone, and then it depends on the Windine&s;s of the &s;olid and liquid Food of the Per&s;on affected with it, &s;uch as the <HI>Mu&s;t</HI> or new Wine, Beer, e&s;|pecially very new Beer, certain Fruits and Garden-&s;tuff. It may
<PB N="162" REF="012243_0182_0F8DFBFB36EA0390">
be cured by a Gly&s;ter; by chaffing the Body with hot Cloths; by the U&s;e of Drink moderately &s;piced; and e&s;pecially by Camo|mile Tea, to which a little cordial Confection, or even Venice Treacle, may be added. When the Pains are almo&s;t entirely va|ni&s;hed, and there is no Fever, nor any unhealthful Degree of Heat; and if the Patient is &s;en&s;ible of a Weakne&s;s at Stomach, he may take a little aromatic, or &s;piced Wine, or even a &s;mall cordial &s;tomachic Dram. It &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e are not to be allowed in any other Kind of Cholic.</P>
<P>&sect; 311. When any Per&s;on is frequently &s;ubject to cholic-like Pains, it is a Proof that the dige&s;tive Faculty is impaired, the re|&s;toring of which &s;hould be carefully attended to; &s;ince, without this, the Health of the Patient mu&s;t &s;uffer con&s;iderably, and he mu&s;t be very likely to contract many tedious and trouble&s;ome Di&s;orders.</P>

<HEAD>Of Cholics from Cold.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 312. When any Per&s;on has been very cold, and e&s;pecially in his Feet, it is not uncommon for him to be attacked, within a few Hours after it, with violent Cholic Pains, in which heating and &s;pirituous Medicines are very pernicious: but which are ea&s;ily cured by rubbing the Legs well with hot Cloths, and keeping them afterwards for a con&s;iderable time in warm Water; advi&s;ing the Patient at the &s;ame time to drink freely of a light Infu&s;ion of Camomile or Elder-flowers.</P>
<P>The Cure will be effected the &s;ooner, if the Patient is put to Bed and &s;weats a little, e&s;pecially in the Legs and Feet.</P>
<P>A Woman who had put her Legs into a pretty cool Spring, af|ter travelling in the Height of Summer, was very quickly after at|tacked with a mo&s;t violent Cholic. She took different hot Medi|cines; &s;he became &s;till wor&s;e; &s;he was purged, but the Di&s;temper was &s;till further aggravated.

In &s;hort they &s;hould never be given, and when it is difficult to di&s;cover the real Cau&s;e of the Cholic, I advi&s;e Country People to confine them&s;elves to the three following Remedies, which cannot be hurtful in any Sort of Cholic, and may remove as many as are not of a violent Nature. Fir&s;t then, let Gly&s;ters be frequently repeated. 2, Let the Patient drink warm Water plentifully, or Elder-flower Tea. 3, Let the Belly be often fomented in pretty warm Wa|ter, which is the mo&s;t preferable Fomentation of any.</P>

Chronical Di&s;ea&s;es not coming within the Plan of this Work, I purpo&s;ely forbear treating of any Kind of tho&s;e tedious Cholics, which afflict &s;ome People for many Years: but I think it my Duty to admoni&s;h &s;uch, that their Torments being very ge|nerally occa&s;ioned by Ob&s;tructions in the <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> or different Bo|wels of the Belly, or by &s;ome other Fault, and more particular|ly in tho&s;e Organs, which are intended to prepare the Bile, they &s;hould, 1, avoid with the greate&s;t Care, the U&s;e of &s;harp, hot, violent Medicines, Vomits, &s;trong Purges, Elixirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2, They &s;hould be thoroughly on their Guard again&s;t all tho&s;e, who pro|mi&s;e them a very &s;peedy Cure, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome &s;pecific Remedy; and ought to look upon them as Mountebanks, into who&s;e Hands it is highly dangerous to tru&s;t them&s;elves. 3, They &s;hould be per&s;uaded, or rather convinced, that they can entertain no rea&s;onable Hope of being cured, without an exact Conformity to a proper and judicious Regimen; and a long Per&s;everance in a Cour&s;e of mild and &s;afe Remedies. 4, They &s;hould continually reflect with them&s;elves, that there is little Difficulty in doing them great Mi&s;chief; and that their Complaints are of that Sort, which require the greate&s;t Knowledge and Prudence in tho&s;e Per|&s;ons, to whom the Treatment and Cure of them are confided.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXII. Of the Iliac Pa&s;&s;ion, and of the Cholera-morbus.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 316. THESE violent Di&s;ea&s;es are fatal to many Country People, while their Neighbours are frequently &s;o ignorant of the
<PB N="164" REF="012243_0184_0F8DFBFCA960F4E0">
Cau&s;e of their Death, that Super&s;tition has a&s;cribed it to Poi&s;on, or to Witchcraft.</P>
<P>&sect; 317. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, the <HI>Mi&s;erere,</HI> or Iliac Pa&s;&s;ion, is one of the mo&s;t excruciating Di&s;tempers. If any Part of the Inte&s;tines, the Cavity of the Guts is clo&s;ed up, whatever may have occa&s;ion|ed it, the Cour&s;e or De&s;cent of the Food they contain is nece&s;&s;a|rily &s;topped; in which Ca&s;e it frequently happens, that the con|tinual Motion ob&s;erved in the Guts of a living Animal di&s;&s;ected, and which was intended to detrude, or force their Contents downwards, is propagated in a directly contrary Manner, from the Guts towards the Mouth.</P>
<P>This Di&s;ea&s;e &s;ometimes begins after a Con&s;tipation, or Co&s;tive|ne&s;s, of &s;ome Days; at other times without that Co&s;tivene&s;s, having been preceded by Pains in any Part of the Belly, e&s;pecially around the Navel; but which Pains, gradually increa&s;ing after their Commencement, at length become extremely violent, and throw the Patient into exce&s;&s;ive Angui&s;h. In &s;ome of the&s;e Ca&s;es a hard Tumour may be felt, which &s;urrounds the Belly like a Cord. The Flatulences within become very audible, &s;ome of them are di&s;charged upwards; in a little time after, Vomitings come on, which increa&s;e till the Patient has thrown up all he had taken in, with a &s;till further Augmentation of the exce&s;&s;ive Pain. With the fir&s;t of his Vomitings he only brings up the la&s;t Food he had taken, with his Drink and &s;ome yellowi&s;h Humour: but what comes up afterwards proves &s;tinking; and when the Di&s;ea&s;e is greatly heightened, they have what is called the Smell of Excre|ment or Dung; but which rather re&s;embles that of a putrid dead Body. It happens too &s;ometimes, that if the Sick have taken Gly&s;ters compo&s;ed of Materials of a &s;trong Smell; the &s;ame Smell is perceivable in the Matter they vomit up. I confe&s;s, however, I never &s;aw either real Excrements, or the Sub&s;tance of their Gly&s;|ters, brought up, much le&s;s the Suppo&s;itories that were intro|duced into the Fundament: and were it credible that In&s;tances of this Kind had occurred, they mu&s;t be allowed very difficult to ac|count for. Throughout this whole Term of the Di&s;ea&s;e, the Pa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ent has not a &s;ingle Di&s;charge by Stool; the Belly is greatly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;tended; the Urine not &s;eldom &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and at other times <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hick and foetid. The Pul&s;e, which at fir&s;t was pretty hard, be|comes quick and &s;mall; the Strength entirely vani&s;hes; a Raving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">omes on; a Hiccup almo&s;t con&s;tantly &s;upervenes, and &s;ometimes general Convul&s;ions; the Extremities grow cold, the Pul&s;e is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">carcely perceivable; the Pain and the Vomiting cea&s;e, and the Patient dies very quickly after.</P>
<P>&sect; 318 As this Di&s;ea&s;e is highly dangerous, the Moment it is &s;trongly apprehended, it is nece&s;&s;ary to oppo&s;e it by proper Means and Remedies: the &s;malle&s;t Error may be of fatal Con&s;equence, and hot inflaming Liquids have been known to kill the Patient in a few Hours. I was called in the &s;econd Day of the Di&s;ea&s;e to a young Per&s;on, who had taken a good deal of Venice Treacle: no|thing
<PB N="165" REF="012243_0185_0F8DFBFDCD3D30D0">
could afford her any Relief, and &s;he died early on the third Day.</P>
<P>This Di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould be treated preci&s;ely in the &s;ame Manner as an inflammatory Cholic; the principal Difference being, that in the former there are no Stools, but continual Vomitings.</P>
<P>1, Fir&s;t of all then the Patient &s;hould be plentifully bled, if the Phy&s;ician has been called in early enough, and before the Sick has lo&s;t his Strength.</P>
<P>2, He &s;hould receive opening Gly&s;ters made of a Decoction of Barley Water, with five or &s;ix Ounces of Oil in each.</P>
<P>3, We &s;hould endeavour to allay the violent Efforts to vomit, by giving every two Hours a Spoonful of the Mixture No. 48.</P>
<P>4, The Sick &s;hould drink plentifully, in very &s;mall Quantities, very often repeated, of an appea&s;ing, diluting, refre&s;hing Drink, which tends at the &s;ame time to promote both Stools and Urine. Nothing is preferable to the Whey No. 49, if it can be had im|mediately: if not, give &s;imple clear Whey &s;weetened with Honey, and the Drinks pre&s;cribed &sect; 298, Art. 3.</P>
<P>5, The Patient is to be put into a warm Bath, and kept there as long as he can bear it; repeating it as often daily too, as his Strength will permit.</P>
<P>6, After Bleeding, warm Bathing, repeated Gly&s;ters and Fo|mentations, if each and all of the&s;e have availed nothing; the Fume or Smoak of Tobacco may be introduced in the Manner of a Gly&s;ter, of which I &s;hall &s;peak further, in the Chapter on Per|&s;ons drowned.</P>
<P>I cured a Per&s;on of this Di&s;ea&s;e, by conveying him into a Bath, immediately after bleeding him, and giving him a Purge on his going into the Bath.</P>
<P>&sect; 319. If the Pain abates before the Patient has quite lo&s;t his Strength; if the Pul&s;e improves at the &s;ame time; if the Vomit|ings are le&s;s in Number, and in the Quantity of the Matter brought up; if that Matter &s;eems in a le&s;s putrid offen&s;ive State; if he feels &s;ome Commotion and Rumbling in his Bowels; if he has &s;ome little Di&s;charge by Stool; and if at the &s;ame time he feels him&s;elf a little &s;tronger than before, his Cure may rea&s;ona|bly be expected; but if he is otherwi&s;e circum&s;tanced he will &s;oon depart. It frequently happens, a &s;ingle Hour before Death, that the Pain &s;eems to vani&s;h, and a &s;urprizing Quantity of extremely foetid Matter is di&s;charged by Stool: the Patient is &s;uddenly &s;eiz|ed with a great Weakne&s;s and Sinking, falls into a cold Sweat, and immediately expires.</P>
<P>&sect; 320. This is the Di&s;ea&s;e which the common People attribute to, and term, the <HI>Twi&s;ting of the Guts</HI>; and in which they make the Patient &s;wallow Bullets, or large Quantities of Quick-&s;ilver. This twi&s;ting, tangling, or knotting of the Guts is an utter, an im|po&s;&s;ible Chimera; for how can they admit of &s;uch a Circum&s;tance, as one of their Extremities, their Ends, is connected to the Sto|mach, and the other irremovably fa&s;tened to the Skin of the Fork

or Cleft of the Buttocks? In fact this Di&s;ea&s;e re&s;ults from a Vari|ety of Cau&s;es, which have been di&s;covered on a Di&s;&s;ection of tho&s;e who have died of it. It were to be wi&s;hed indeed this prudent Cu&s;tom, &s;o extremely conducive to enrich, and to perfect, the Art of Phy&s;ic, were to prevail more generally; and which we ought rather to con&s;ider as a Duty to comply with, than a Difficulty to &s;ubmit to; as it is our Duty to contribute to the Perfection of a Science, on which the Happine&s;s of Mankind &s;o con&s;iderably de|pends. I &s;hall not enter into a Detail of the&s;e Cau&s;es; but what|ever they are, the Practice of &s;wallowing Bullets in the Di&s;ea&s;e is always pernicious, and the like U&s;e of Mercury mu&s;t be often &s;o<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notwith&s;tanding this, a Practitioner of great Probity and Experience a&s;&s;ures me, he has &s;een a Cure affected in this Ca&s;e, by giving two Ounces of Quick&s;il|ver, every third Hour, when every other Remedy had been ineffectual. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE>.

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Cholera-morbus.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 321. This Di&s;ea&s;e is a &s;udden, abundant, and painful Eva|cuation, by vomiting and by Stool.</P>
<P>It begins with much Flatulence, or Wind, with &s;welling and &s;light Pains in the Belly, accompanied with great Dejection; and followed with large Evacuations either by Stool or by Vomit at fir&s;t, but whenever either of them has begun, the other quickly follows. The Matter evacuated is either yellowi&s;h, green, brown, whiti&s;h, or black; the Pains in the Belly are violent; the Pul&s;e, (almo&s;t con&s;tantly feveri&s;h,) is &s;ometimes &s;trong at fir&s;t, but &s;oon &s;inks into Weakne&s;s, in Con&s;equence of the prodigious Di&s;charge. Some Patients purge a hundred times in the Compa&s;s of a few Hours; they may even be &s;een to fall away; and if the Di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ts in a violent Degree, they are &s;carcely to be known within three or four Hours from the Commencement of the&s;e Di&s;charges. After a great Number of them they are afflicted with Spa&s;ms or Cramps, in their Legs, Thighs, and Arms, which torment them as much as the Pains in the Belly. When the Di&s;ea&s;e rages too highly to be a&s;&s;waged, Hiccups, Convul&s;ions, and a Coldne&s;s of the Extremities approach; there is a &s;carcely intermitting Succe&s;|&s;ion of fainting, or &s;wooning Fits, the Patient dying either in one of them, or in Convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>&sect; 322. This Di&s;ea&s;e, which con&s;tantly depends on Bile rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t Acrimony, commonly prevails towards the End of July and in Augu&s;t: e&s;pecially if the Heats have been very vio|lent, and there have been little or no Summer Fruits, which greatly conduce to attemper and allay the putre&s;cent Acrimony of the Bile.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="012243_0187_0F8DFBFF77F1F1F8">&sect; 323. Neverthele&s;s, however violent this Di&s;temper may be, it is le&s;s dangerous, and al&s;o le&s;s tormenting than the former, many Per&s;ons recovering from it.</P>
<P>1, Our fir&s;t Endeavour &s;hould be to dilute, or even to drown this acrid Bile, by Draughts, by Deluges, of the mo&s;t mitigat|ing Drinks; the Irritation being &s;o very great, that every thing having the lea&s;t Sharpne&s;s is injurious. Wherefore the Patient &s;hould continually take in, by Drink, and by Way of Gly&s;ter, ei|ther Barley Water, Almond-Milk, or pure Water; with one eighth Part Milk, which has &s;ucceeded very well in my Practice. Or he may u&s;e a very light Decoction, or Pti&s;an, as it were, of Bread, which is made by gently boiling a Pound of toa&s;ted Bread in three or four Pots of Water for half an Hour. In <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland</HI> we prefer Oat-bread. We al&s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;e pounded Rye, ma|king a light Pti&s;an of it.</P>
<P>A very light thin Soup made of a Pullet, a Chicken, or of one Pound of lean Veal, in three Pots of Water, is very proper too in this Di&s;ea&s;e. Whey is al&s;o employed to good Purpo&s;e; and in tho&s;e Places where it can ea&s;ily be had, Butter-milk is the be&s;t Drink of any. But, whichever of the&s;e Drinks &s;hall be thought preferable, it is a nece&s;&s;ary Point to drink very plentifully of it; and the Gly&s;ters &s;hould be given every two Hours.</P>
<P>2, If the Patient is of a robu&s;t Con&s;titution, and &s;anguine Com|plexion, with a &s;trong Pul&s;e at the Time of the Attack, and the Pains are very &s;evere, a fir&s;t, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es a &s;econd Bleed|ing, very early on the Inva&s;ion, a&s;&s;wages the Violence of the Ma|lady, and allows more Lei&s;ure for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of other Reme|dies. I have &s;een the Vomiting cea&s;e almo&s;t entirely, after the fir&s;t Bleeding.</P>
<P>The Rage of this Di&s;ea&s;e abates a little after a Duration of five or &s;ix Hours: We mu&s;t not however, during this Remi&s;&s;ion, or Abatement, forbear to throw in proper Remedies; &s;ince it returns &s;oon after with great Force, which Return however indicates no Alteration of the Method already entered upon.</P>
<P>3, In general, the warm Bath refre&s;hes the Patient while he continues in it: but the Pains frequently return &s;oon after he is taken out; which, however, is no Rea&s;on for omitting it, &s;ince it has frequently been found to give a more durable Relief. The Patient &s;hould continue in it a con&s;iderable Time, and, during that Time, he &s;hould take &s;ix or &s;even Gla&s;&s;es of the Potion No. 32, which has been very efficacious in this Di&s;ea&s;e. By the&s;e Means the Vomiting has been &s;topt; and the Patient, upon go|ing out of the Bath, has had &s;everal large Stools, which very con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed the Violence of the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>4, If the Patient's Attendants are terrified by the&s;e great E|vacuations, and determine to check them (however prematurely) by Venice Treacle, Mint Water, Syrup of white Poppies, called Diacodium, by Opium or Mithridate, it either happens, that the Di&s;ea&s;e and all its Symptoms are heightened, to which I have
<PB N="168" REF="012243_0188_0F8DFBFFA5F77F68">
been a Witne&s;s; or, if the Evacuations &s;hould actually be &s;topt, the Patient, in Con&s;equence of it, is thrown into a more dange|rous Condition. I have been obliged to give a Purge, in order to renew the Di&s;charges, to a Man, who had been thrown into a violent Fever, attended with a raging <HI>Delirium,</HI> by a Medicine compo&s;ed of Venice Treacle, Mithridate and Oil. Such Medi|cines ought not to be employed, until the Smallne&s;s of the Pul&s;e, great Weakne&s;s, violent and almo&s;t continual Cramps, and even the In&s;ufficience of the Patient's Efforts to vomit, make us appre|hen&s;ive of his &s;inking irrecoverably. In &s;uch Circum&s;tances in|deed he &s;hould take every Quarter or half Quarter of an Hour, a Spoonful of the Mixture No. 50, &s;till continuing the diluting Drinks. After the fir&s;t Hour, they &s;hould only be given every Hour, and that only to the Extent of eight Do&s;es. But I de&s;ire to in&s;i&s;t upon it here, that this Medicine &s;hould not be given too early in this Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>&sect; 324. If the Patient is likely to recover, the Pains and the E|vacuations gradually abate; the Thir&s;t is le&s;s; the Pul&s;e conti|nues very quick, but it becomes regular. There have been In|&s;tances of their Propen&s;ity to a heavy Kind of Drow&s;ine&s;s at this time; for perfect refre&s;hing Sleep advances but &s;lowly after this Di&s;ea&s;e. It will &s;till be proper to per&s;evere in the Medicines al|ready directed, though &s;omewhat le&s;s frequently. And now we may begin to allow the Patient a few Soups from farinaceous mea|ly Sub&s;tances; and as &s;oon as the Evacuations accompanying this Di&s;ea&s;e are evidently cea&s;ed, and the Pains are vani&s;hed, though an acute Sen&s;ibility and great Weakne&s;s continue, be&s;ide &s;uch Soups, he may be allowed &s;ome new-laid Eggs, very lightly boiled, or even raw, for &s;ome Days. After this he mu&s;t be re|ferred to the Regimen &s;o frequently recommended to Per&s;ons in a State of Recovery: when the concurring U&s;e of the Powder No. 24, taken twice a Day, will greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t to ha&s;ten and e&s;tabli&s;h his Health.</P>

<P>There are certain very chronical, or tedious and ob&s;tinate ones, which ari&s;e from &s;ome e&s;&s;ential Fault in the Con&s;titution. Of &s;uch, as foreign to my Plan, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="012243_0189_0F8DFC02B71E6D88">Tho&s;e which come on &s;uddenly, without any preceding Di&s;or|der, except &s;ometimes a &s;light Qualm or &s;hort Loathing, and a Pain in the Loins and Knees; which are not attended with &s;mart Pains nor a Fever (and frequently without any Pain, or any other Complaint) are oftner of Service than prejudicial. They carry off a Heap of Matter that may have been long ama&s;&s;ed and cor|rupted in the Body; which, if not di&s;charged, might have pro|duced &s;ome Di&s;temper; and, far from weakening the Body, &s;uch Purgings as the&s;e render it more &s;trong, light and active.</P>
<P>&sect; 326. Such therefore ought by no Means to be &s;topped, nor even &s;peedily checked: they generally cea&s;e of them&s;elves, as &s;oon as all the noxious Matter is di&s;charged; and as they require no Medicine, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to retrench con&s;iderably from the ordinary Quantity of Nouri&s;hment; to ab&s;tain from Fle&s;h, Eggs and Wine or other &s;trong Drink; to live only on &s;ome Soaps, on Puls, or on a little Fruit, whether raw or baked, and to drink ra|ther le&s;s than u&s;ual. A &s;imple Pti&s;an with a little Syrup of <HI>Ca|pillaire,</HI> or Maiden hair, is &s;ufficient in the&s;e Purgings, which re|quire no Venice Treacle, Confection, nor any Drug whatever.</P>
<P>&sect; 327. But &s;hould it continue more than five or &s;ix Days, and manife&s;tly weaken the Patient: if the Pain attending it grows a little &s;evere; and e&s;pecially if the Irritation, the urging to Stool, proves more frequent, it becomes &s;ea&s;onable to check or to &s;top it. For this Purpo&s;e the Patient is to be put into a Regimen; and if the Loo&s;ene&s;s has been accompanied with a great Loathing, with Ri&s;ings or Wamblings at Stomach, with a foul furred Tongue, and a bad Ta&s;t in the Mouth, he mu&s;t take the Powder No. 35. But if the&s;e Symptoms do not appear, give him that of No. 51: and during the three following Hours, let him take, every half Hour, a Cup of weak light Broth, without any Fat on it.</P>
<P>If the Purging, after being re&s;trained by this Medicine, &s;hould return within a few Days, it would &s;trongly infer, there was &s;till &s;ome tough vi&s;cid Matter within, that required Evacuation. To effect this he &s;hould take the Medicines No. 21, 25 or 27; and afterwards take fa&s;ting, for two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Mornings, half the Powder No. 51.</P>
<P>On the Evening of that Day when the Patient took No. 35, or No. 51, or any other Purge, he may take a &s;mall Do&s;e of Venice Treacle.</P>
<P>&sect; 328. A Purging is often neglected for a long time, without ob&s;erving the lea&s;t Regimen, from which Neglect they degenerate into tedious, and as it were, habitual, perpetual ones, and en|tirely weaken the Patient.

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIV. Of the Dy&s;entery, or Bloody-flux.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 329. THE Dy&s;entery is a Flux or Loo&s;ene&s;s of the Belly, attended with great Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and Angui&s;h, with &s;evere Gripings, and frequent Propen&s;ities to go to Stool. There is generally a lit|tle Blood in the Stools, though this is not a con&s;tant Symptom, and is not e&s;&s;ential to the Exi&s;tence of a Dy&s;entery; notwith|&s;tanding it may not be much le&s;s dangerous, for the Ab&s;ence of this Symptom.</P>
<P>&sect; 330. The Dy&s;entery is often epidemical; beginning &s;ome|times at the End of July, though oftner in Augu&s;t, and going off when the Fro&s;ts &s;et in. The great preceding Heats render the Blood and the Bile acrid and &s;harp; and though during the Con|tinuance of the Heat, Per&s;piration is kept up (See Introduct. P. 14) yet as &s;oon as the Heat abates, e&s;pecially in the Mornings and Evenings, that Di&s;charge is dimini&s;hed; and by how much the more Vi&s;cidity or Thickne&s;s the Humours have acquired, in Con&s;equence of the violent Heats, (the Di&s;charge of the &s;harp Humour by Per&s;piration being now checked,) it is thrown upon the Bowels, which it irritates, producing Pains in, and Evacua|tions from them.</P>
<P>This Kind of Dy&s;entery may happen at all times, and in all Countries; but if other Cau&s;es, capable of producing a Putri|dity of the Humours, be complicated with it; &s;uch as the croud|ing up a great Number of People into very little Room, and very clo&s;e Quarters, as in Ho&s;pitals, Camps, or Pri&s;ons, this intro|duces a malignant Principle into the Humours, which, co-ope|rating with the &s;imple Cau&s;e of the Dy&s;entery, renders it the more difficult and dangerous.</P>
<P>&sect; 331. This Di&s;ea&s;e begins with a general Coldne&s;s rather than a Shivering, which la&s;ts &s;ome Hours; the Patient's Strength &s;oon abates, and he feels &s;harp Pains in his Belly, which &s;ometimes continue for &s;everal Hours, before the Flux begins. He is affected with <HI>Vertigos,</HI> or Swimmings in the Head, with Reachings to vomit, and grows pale; his Pul&s;e at the &s;ame time being very little, if at all, feveri&s;h, but commonly &s;mall, and at length the Purging begins. The fir&s;t Stools are often thin, and yellowi&s;h; but in a little time they are mixt with a vi&s;cid ropy Matter, which

is often tinged with Blood. Their Colour and Con&s;i&s;tence are va|rious too, being either brown, greeni&s;h, or black, thinner or thicker, and foetid. The Pains increa&s;e before each of the Di&s;|charges, which grow very frequent, to the Number of eight, ten, twelve, or fifteen in an Hour: then the Fundament becomes con&s;iderably irritated, and the <HI>Tene&s;mus</HI> (which is a great Urgency to go to Stool, though without any Effect) is joined to the Dy|&s;entery or Flux, and often brings on a Protru&s;ion or falling down of the Fundament, the Patient being now mo&s;t &s;everely afflicted. Worms are &s;ometimes voided, and glairy hairy Humours, re|&s;embling Pieces of Peelings of Guts, and &s;ometimes Clots of Blood.</P>
<P>If the Di&s;temper ri&s;es to a violent Height, the Guts become inflamed, which terminates either in Suppuration or in Mortifica|tion; the mi&s;erable Patient di&s;charges <HI>Pus,</HI> or black and foetid watery Stools: The Hiccup &s;upervenes; he grows delirious; his Pul&s;e &s;inks; and he falls into cold Sweats and Faintings which terminate in Death.</P>
<P>A kind of Phrenzy, or raging <HI>Delirium,</HI> &s;ometimes comes on before the Minute of Expiration. I have &s;een a very unu&s;ual Symptom accompany this Di&s;ea&s;e in two Per&s;ons, which was an Impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;wallowing, for three Days before Death.</P>
<P>But in general this Di&s;temper is not &s;o extremely violent; the Di&s;charges are le&s;s frequent, being from twenty-five to forty within a Day and Night. Their Contents are le&s;s various and uncommon, and mixed with very little Blood; the Patient re|tains more Strength; the Number of Stools gradually decrea&s;es; the Blood di&s;appears; the Con&s;i&s;tence of the Di&s;charges im|proves; Sleep and Appetite return, and the Sick recover.</P>
<P>Many of the Sick have not the lea&s;t Degree or Fever, nor of Thir&s;t, which perhaps is le&s;s common in this Di&s;ea&s;e, than in a &s;imple Purging or Loo&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>Their Urine &s;ometimes is but in a &s;mall Quantity; and many Patients have ineffectual Endeavours to pa&s;s it, to their no &s;mall Affliction and Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; 332. The mo&s;t efficacious Remedy for this Di&s;ea&s;e is a Vo|mit. That of No. 34. (when there is no pre&s;ent Circum&s;tance that forbids the giving a Vomit) if taken immediately on the fir&s;t Inva&s;ion of it, often removes it at once; and always &s;hortens its Duration. That of No. 35 is not le&s;s effectual; it has been con|&s;idered for a long time, even as a certain Specific, which it is not, though a very u&s;eful Medicine. If the Stools prove le&s;s frequent after the Operation of either of them, it is a good Sign; if they are no ways dimini&s;hed, we may apprehend the Di&s;ea&s;e is like to be tedious and ob&s;tinate.</P>
<P>The Patient is to be ordered to a Regimen, ab&s;taining from all Fle&s;h-meat with the &s;tricte&s;t Attention, until the perfect Cure of the Di&s;ea&s;e. The Pti&s;an No. 3 is the be&s;t Drink for him.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="012243_0192_0F8DFC05C4FA6230">The Day after the Vomit, he mu&s;t take the Powder No. 51 di|vided into two Do&s;es: the next Day he &s;hould take no other Medicine but his Pti&s;an; on the fourth the Rhubarb mu&s;t be re|peated, after which the Violence of the Di&s;ea&s;e commonly abates. His Diet during the Di&s;ea&s;e is neverthele&s;s to be continued exactly for &s;ome Days; after which he may be allowed to enter upon that of Per&s;ons in a State of Recovery.</P>
<P>&sect; 333. The Dy&s;entery &s;ometimes commences with an inflam|matory Fever; a feveri&s;h, hard, full Pul&s;e, with a violent Pain in the Head, and Loins, and a &s;tiff di&s;tended Belly. In &s;uch a Ca&s;e the Patient mu&s;t be bled once; and daily receive three or even four of the Gly&s;ters No. 6, drinking plentifully of the Drink No. 3.</P>
<P>When all Dread of an Inflammation is entirely over, the Pa|tient is to be treated in the Manner ju&s;t related; though often there is no Nece&s;&s;ity for the Vomit: and if the inflammatory Symptoms have run high, his fir&s;t Purge &s;hould be that of No. 11, and the U&s;e of the Rhubarb may be po&s;tponed, till about the manife&s;t Conclu&s;ion of the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I have cured many Dy&s;enteries, by ordering the Sick no other Remedy, but a Cup of warm Water every Quarter of an Hour; and it were better to rely only on this &s;imple Remedy, which mu&s;t be of &s;ome Utility, than to employ tho&s;e, of who&s;e Effects Country People are ignorant, and which are often productive of very dangerous ones.</P>
<P>&sect; 334. It &s;ometimes happens that the Dy&s;entery is combined with a putrid Fever, which makes it nece&s;&s;ary, after the Vomit, to give the Purges No. 23 or 47, and &s;everal Do&s;es of No. 24, be|fore the Rhubarb is given. No. 32 is excellent in this combined Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>There was in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> in the Autumn of 1755, after a very numerous Prevalence of epidemical putrid Fevers had cea&s;ed, a Multitude of Dy&s;enteries, which had no &s;mall Affinity with, or Relation to, &s;uch Fevers. I treated them fir&s;t, with the Pre&s;crip|tion No. 34, giving afterwards No. 32; and I directed the Rhu|barb only to very few, and that towards the Conclu&s;ion of the Di&s;ea&s;e. By much the greater Number of them were cured at the End of four or five Days. A &s;mall Proportion of them, to whom I could not give the Vomit, or who&s;e Ca&s;es were more compli|cated, remained languid a con&s;iderable time, though without Fatality or Danger</P>
<P>&sect; 335. When the Dy&s;entery is blended with Symptoms of Ma|lignity (See &sect; 245.) after premi&s;ing the Pre&s;cription No. 35, tho&s;e of No. 38 and 39 may be called in &s;ucce&s;sfully.</P>
<P>&sect; 336. When the Di&s;ea&s;e has already been of many Days &s;tand|ing, without the Patient's having taken any Medicines, or only &s;uch as were injurious to him, he mu&s;t be treated as if the Di|&s;temper had but ju&s;t commenced; unle&s;s &s;ome Symptoms, fo|reign to the Nature of the Dy&s;entery, have &s;upervened upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="012243_0193_0F8DFC066EA24738">&sect; 337. Relap&s;es &s;ometimes occur in Dy&s;enteries, &s;ome few Days after the Patients appeared well; much the greater Number of which are occa&s;ioned either by &s;ome Error in Diet, by cold Air, or by being con&s;iderably over-heated. They are to be prevented by avoiding the&s;e Cau&s;es of them; and may be removed by put|ting the Patient on his Regimen, and giving him one Do&s;e of the Pre&s;cription No. 51. Should it return even without any &s;uch di&s;coverable Cau&s;es, and if it manife&s;ts it&s;elf to be the &s;ame Di|&s;temper renewed, it mu&s;t be treated as &s;uch.</P>
<P>&sect; 338. This Di&s;ea&s;e is &s;ometimes combined too with an inter|mitting Fever; in which Ca&s;e the Dy&s;entery mu&s;t be removed fir&s;t, and the Intermittent afterwards. Neverthele&s;s, if at each Acce&s;s, the Fits of the Fever have been very &s;trong, Bark mu&s;t be given as directed, &sect; 259.</P>
<P>&sect; 339. One pernicious Prejudice, which &s;till generally prevails is, that Fruits are noxious in a Dy&s;entery, that they even give it, and aggravate it; and this perhaps is an extremely ill-grounded one. In truth bad Fruits, and &s;uch as have not ripened well, in un&s;ea&s;onable Years, may really occa&s;ion Cholics, a Loo&s;ene&s;s (though oftner a Co&s;tivene&s;s) and Di&s;orders of the Nerves, and of the Skin; but never can occa&s;ion an epidemical Dy&s;entery or Flux. Ripe Fruits, of whatever Species, and e&s;pecially Summer Fruits, are the real Pre&s;ervatives from this Di&s;ea&s;e. The greate&s;t Mi&s;chief they can effect, mu&s;t re&s;ult from their thinning and wa&s;h|ing down the Humours, e&s;pecially the mick glutinous Bile, if they are in &s;uch a State; good ripe Fruits being the true Di&s;&s;ol|vents of &s;uch; in Con&s;equence of which indeed they may bring on a Purging, but &s;uch a one, as is rather a Guard again&s;t a Dy|&s;entery.</P>
<P>We had a great, an extraordinary Abundance of Fruit in 1759 and 1760, but &s;carcely any Dy&s;enteries. It has even been ob|&s;erved to be more rare, and le&s;s dangerous than formerly; and if the Fact is certain, it cannot be attributed to any thing more pro|bably, than to the very numerous Plantations of Trees, which have rendered Fruit very plenty, cheap and common. Whene|ver I have ob&s;erved Dy&s;enteries to prevail. I made it a Rule to eat le&s;s Fle&s;h, and Plenty of Fruit; I have never had the &s;lighte&s;t At|tack of one; and &s;everal Phy&s;icians u&s;e the &s;ame Caution with the &s;ame Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>I have &s;een eleven Patients in a Dy&s;entery in one Hou&s;e, of whom nine were very tractable: they eat Fruit and recovered. The Grandmother and one Child, whom &s;he loved more than the re&s;t, were carried off. She managed the Child after her own F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hion, with burnt Wine, Oil, and &s;ome Spices, but no Fruit. She conducted her&s;elf in the very &s;ame Manner, and both died.</P>
<P>In a Country Seat near <HI>Berne,</HI> in the Year 1751, when the&s;e Fluxes made great Havock, and People were &s;everely warned a|gain&s;t the U&s;e of Fruits, out of eleven Per&s;ons in the Family, ten eat plentifully of Plums, and not one of them was &s;eized with it;
<PB N="174" REF="012243_0194_0F8DFC0726DB20D8">
The poor Coachman alone rigidly ob&s;erved that Ab&s;tinence from Fruit injoined by this Prejudice, and took a terrible Dy&s;entery.</P>
<P>This &s;ame Di&s;temper had nearly de&s;troyed a Swi&s;s Regiment in Garri&s;on in the South of <HI>France</HI>; the Captains purcha&s;ed the whole Crop of &s;everal Acres of Vineyard; there they carried the &s;ick Soldiers, and gathered the Grapes for &s;uch as could not bear being carried into the Vineyard; tho&s;e who were well eating no|thing el&s;e; after this not one more died, nor were any more even attacked with the Dy&s;entery.</P>
<P>A Clergyman was &s;eized with a Dy&s;entery, which was not in the lea&s;t mitigated by any Medicines he had taken. By meer Chance he &s;aw &s;ome red Currans; he longed for them, and eat three Pounds of them between &s;even and nine o'Clock in the Morning; that very Day he became better, and was entirely well on the next.</P>
<P>I could greatly enlarge the Number of &s;uch In&s;tances; but the&s;e may &s;uffice to convince the mo&s;t incredulous, whom I thought it might be of &s;ome Importance to convince. Far from forbid|ding good Fruit, when Di&s;enteries rage, the Patients &s;hould be encouraged to eat them freely; and the Directors of the Police, in&s;tead of prohibiting them, ought to &s;ee the Markets well pro|vided with them. It is a Fact of which Per&s;ons, who have care|fully informed them&s;elves, do not in the lea&s;t doubt. Experi|ence demon&s;trates it, and it is founded in Rea&s;on, as good Fruit counter-operates all the Cau&s;es of Dy&s;enteries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Experience of all Countries and Times &s;o &s;trongly confirms the&s;e im|portant Truths, that they cannot be too often repeated, too generally publi&s;hed, whenever and wherever this Di&s;ea&s;e rages.

<P>I have retained the preceding Note, abridged from this Gentleman, as it con|tains the Suffrage of another experienced Phy&s;ician again&s;t that Prejudice of ripe Fruits occa&s;ioning Fluxes, which is too popular among our&s;elves, and proba|bly more &s;o in the Country than in <HI>London.</HI> I have been al&s;o very credibly a&s;|&s;ured, that the Son of a learned Phy&s;ician was perfectly cured of a very o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ti|nate Purging, of a Year's Continuance (in Spite of all the u&s;ual officinal Reme|dies) by his devouring large Quantities of ripe Mulberries (for which he ardently longed) and at length drinking very freely of their expre&s;&s;ed Juice.

<P>&sect; 341. It has happened, by &s;ome unaccountable Fatality, that there is no Di&s;ea&s;e, for which a greater Number of Remedies are advi&s;ed, than for the Dy&s;entery.

Of the&s;e many boa&s;ted Compo&s;i|tions, &s;ome are only indifferent, but others pernicious. I &s;hall not pretend to detail all I know my&s;elf, but after repeatedly affirm|ing, that the only true Method of Cure is that I have advi&s;ed here, the Purpo&s;e of which is evacuating the offending Matter; I al&s;o affirm that all tho&s;e Methods, which have a different Scope or Drift, are pernicious; but &s;hall particularly ob&s;erve, that the Method mo&s;t generally followed, which is that of &s;topping the Stools by A&s;tringents, or by Opiates, is the wor&s;t of all, and even &s;o mortal a one, as to de&s;troy a Multitude of People annually, and which throws others into incurable Di&s;ea&s;es.

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXV. Of the Itch.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 344. THE Itch is an infections Di&s;order, contracted by touching infected Per&s;ons or Cloaths, but not imbibed from the Air: So that by carefully avoiding the <HI>Medium,</HI> or Means of Conta|gion, the Di&s;order may be certainly e&s;caped.</P>
<P>Though any Part of the Body may be infe&s;ted with the Itch, it commonly &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ws it&s;elf on the Hands, and chiefly between the Fingers. At fir&s;t one or two little Pimples or Pu&s;tules appear, filled with a Kind of clear Water, and excite a very di&s;agreeable Itching. If the&s;e Pu&s;tules are broke by &s;cratching them, the Water oozing from them infects the neighbouring Parts. At the Beginning of this Infection it can &s;carcely be di&s;tingui&s;hed, if a Per&s;on is not well apprized of its Nature; but in the Progre&s;s of it, the little Pu&s;tules increa&s;e both in Number and Size; and when they are opened by &s;cratching, a loath&s;ome Kind of Scab is

formed, and the Malady extends over the whole Surface. Where they continue long, they produce &s;mall Ulcers, and are at that time highly contagious.</P>
<P>&sect; 345. Bad Diet, particularly the U&s;e of &s;alted Meat, bad un|ripe Fruit, and Uncleanline&s;s occa&s;ion this Di&s;ea&s;e: though it is oftne&s;t taken by Contagion. Some very good Phy&s;icians &s;uppo&s;e it is never contracted otherwi&s;e; but I mu&s;t take Leave to di&s;&s;ent, as I have certainly &s;een it exi&s;t without Contagion.</P>
<P>When it happens to a Per&s;on, who cannot &s;u&s;pect he has re|ceived it by Contact, his Cure &s;hould commence with a total Ab|&s;tinence from all &s;alt, &s;our, fat, and &s;picy Food. He &s;hould drink a Pti&s;an of wild and bitter Succory, or that of No. 26, five or &s;ix Gla&s;&s;es of which may be daily taken; at the End of four or five Days, he may be purged with No. 21, or with an Ounce of <HI>Sedlitz</HI> [or <HI>Glauber</HI>] Salt. His Ab&s;tinence, his Regimen is to be continued; the Purge to be repeated after &s;ix or &s;even Days; and then all the Parts affected, and tho&s;e very near them, are to be rubbed in the Morning fa&s;ting, with a fourth Part of the Oint|ment No. 52. The three following Days the &s;ame Friction is to be repeated, after which the &s;ame Quantity of Ointment is to be procured, and u&s;ed in the &s;ame Proportion; but only every other Day. It happens but &s;eldom that this Method fails to remove this di&s;agreeable Malady; &s;ometimes however it will return, in which Ca&s;e the Patient mu&s;t be purged again, and then recur to the Ointment, who&s;e good Effects I have experienced, and continu|ally do.</P>
<P>If the Di&s;ea&s;e has been very lately contracted, and mo&s;t cer|tainly by Contact, the Ointment may be fearle&s;sly employed, as &s;oon as it is di&s;covered, without taking any Purge before it. But if, on the contrary, the Di&s;ea&s;e has been long neglected, and has ro&s;e to a high Degree, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train the Pa|tient a long time to the Regimen I have directed; he mu&s;t be re|peatedly purged, and then drink plentifully of the Pti&s;an No. 26, before the Ointment is rubbed in. When the Malady is thus cir|cum&s;tanced, I have always begun with the Ointment No. 28, half a Quarter of which is to be u&s;ed every Morning. I have al|&s;o frequently omitted the U&s;e of that No. 52, having always found the former as certain, but a little flower in its Effects.</P>
<P>&sect; 346.

<P>The Linen of a Per&s;on in this Di&s;ea&s;e ought to be often chang|ed; but his upper Cloaths mu&s;t not be changed: becau&s;e the&s;e having been infected, might, when worn again, communicate the Itch to the Wearer again, after he had been cured.</P>
<P>Shirts, Breeches, and Stockings may be fumigated with Sul|phur, before they are put on; and this Fumigation &s;hould be made in the open Air.</P>
<P>&sect; 347. If this Di&s;order becomes very inveterate and tedious, it exhau&s;ts the Patient in Con&s;equence of its not &s;uffering him to &s;leep at Nights, as well as by his re&s;tle&s;s Irritation; and &s;ometimes even brings on a Fever, &s;o that he falls away in Fle&s;h, and his Strength abates.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a Ca&s;e he mu&s;t take, 1, a gentle Purge.</P>
<P>2, Make U&s;e frequently of warm Baths.</P>
<P>3, He mu&s;t be put on the Regimen of Per&s;ons in a State of Re|covery.</P>
<P>4, He mu&s;t take Morning and Evening, fifteen Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly, the Powder No. 53, with the Pti&s;an No. 26.</P>
<P>This Malady is often very ob&s;tinate, and then the Medicines mu&s;t be varied according to the Circum&s;tances, the Detail of which I avoid here.</P>
<P>&sect; 348. After giving repeated Purges in &s;uch ob&s;tinate Ca&s;es, mineral Waters abounding with Sulphur, &s;uch as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sea Water, and tho&s;e of <HI>Dulwich, Harrigate, Shadwell,</HI> &amp;c. will be full as effectual. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> tho&s;e of <HI>Y|verdun,</HI> &amp;c. often effect a Cure; and &s;imple cold Bathings in Ri|vers or Lakes, have &s;ometimes &s;ucceeded in very inveterate Ca&s;es of this Di&s;order.</P>
<P>Nothing conduces more to the long Continuance of this Ma|lady, than the Abu&s;e of hot Waters, &s;uch as Infu&s;ions of Tea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 349. I &s;hall conclude this Chapter, with a repeated Injunc|tion not to be too free or ra&s;h in the U&s;e of the Ointment No. 52,

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVI. The Treatment of Di&s;ea&s;es peculiar to Women.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 350. BESIDES all the preceding Di&s;ea&s;es to which Women are liable in common with Men, their Sex al&s;o expo&s;es them to others peculiar to it, and which depend upon four principal Sour|ces; which are their monthly Di&s;charges, their Pregnancy, their Labours in Child-birth&punc; and the Con&s;equences of their Labours. It is not my pre&s;ent De&s;ign to treat profe&s;&s;edly on each of the Di&s;|ea&s;es ari&s;ing from the&s;e Cau&s;es, which would require a larger Vo|lume than I have propo&s;ed; but I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to certain general Directions on the&s;e four Heads.</P>
<P>&sect; 351. Nature, who intended Women for the Increa&s;e, and the Nouri&s;hment of the human Race at the Brea&s;t, has &s;ubjected them to a periodical Efflux, or Di&s;charge, of Blood: which Circum|&s;tance con&s;titutes the Source, from whence the Infant is after|wards to receive his Nutrition and Growth.</P>
<P>This Di&s;charge generally commences, with us, between the Age of &s;ixteen and eighteen. Young Maidens, before the Appearance of this Di&s;charge, are frequently, and many for a long time, in a State of Weakne&s;s, attended with various Complaints, which is termed the <HI>Chloro&s;is,</HI> or Green Sickne&s;s, and Ob&s;tructions: and when their Appearance is extremely &s;low and backward, it occa|&s;ions very grievous, and &s;ometimes even mortal Di&s;ea&s;es. Ne|verthele&s;s it is too u&s;ual, though very improper, to a&s;cribe all the Evils, to which they are &s;ubject at this Term of Life, &s;olely to this Cau&s;e, while they really often re&s;ult from a diffe|rent Cau&s;e, of which the Ob&s;tructions them&s;elves are &s;ometimes only the Effect; and this is the natural, and, in &s;ome Degree, even nece&s;&s;ary Feeblene&s;s of the Sex. The Fibres of Women which are intended to be relaxed, and to give Way, when they are unavoidably extended by the Growth of the Child, and its inclo&s;ing Membranes (which frequently ari&s;e to a very con&s;idera|ble Size) &s;hould nece&s;&s;arily be le&s;s &s;tiff and rigid, le&s;s &s;trong, and more lax and yielding than the Fibres of Men. Hence the Circu|lation
<PB N="180" REF="012243_0200_0F8A6D33C9AA0790">
of their Blood is more &s;low and languid than in Males; their Blood is le&s;s compact and den&s;e, and more watery; their Fluids are more liable to &s;tagnate in their different Bowels, and to form Infarctions and Ob&s;tructions.</P>
<P>&sect; 352. The Di&s;orders to which &s;uch a Con&s;titution &s;ubjects them might, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure be prevented, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting that Langour or Feeblene&s;s of their natural Movements, with &s;uch an Increa&s;e of their Force as Exerci&s;e might contribute to: But this A&s;&s;i&s;|tance, which in &s;ome Manner is more nece&s;&s;ary for Females than Males, they are partly deprived of, by the general Education and Habitude of the Sex; as they are u&s;ually employed in managing Hou&s;hold Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;uch light &s;edentary Work, as affords them le&s;s Exerci&s;e and Motion, than the more active Occupations of Men. They &s;tir about but little, whence their natural Ten|dency to Weakne&s;s increa&s;es from Habit, and thence becomes morbid and &s;ickly. Their Blood circulates imperfectly; its Qua|lities become impaired; the Humours tend to a pretty general Stagnation; and none of the vital Functions are compleatly di&s;|charged.</P>
<P>From &s;uch Cau&s;es and Circum&s;tances, they begin to &s;ink into a State of Weakne&s;s, &s;ometimes while they are very young, and many Years before this periodical Di&s;charge could be expected. This State of Langour di&s;po&s;es them to be inactive; a little Ex|erci&s;e &s;oon fatigues them, whence they take none at all. It might prove a Remedy, and even effect a Cure, at the Beginning of their Complaint; but as it is a Remedy, that is painful and di&s;agreea|ble to them, they reject it, and thus increa&s;e their Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Their Appetite declines with the other vital Functions, and gradually becomes &s;till le&s;s; the u&s;ual &s;alutary Kinds of Food never exciting it; in&s;tead of which they indulge them&s;elves in whim&s;i|cal Cravings, and often of the odde&s;t and mo&s;t improper Sub&s;tan|ces for Nutrition, which entirely impair the Stomach with its di|ge&s;tive Functions, and con&s;equently Health it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But &s;ometimes after the Duration of this State for a few Years, the ordinary time of their monthly Evacuations approaches, which however make not the lea&s;t Appearance, for two Rea&s;ons. The fir&s;t is, that their Health is too much impaired to accompli&s;h this new Function at a time when all the others are &s;o languid: and the &s;econd is, that under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, the Evacuations them|&s;elves are unnece&s;&s;ary; &s;ince their final Purpo&s;e is to di&s;charge (when the Sex are not pregnant) that &s;uperfluous Blood, which they were intended to produce, and who&s;e Retention would be unhealthy, when not applied to the Growth of the Foetus, or Nouri&s;hment of the Child: and this Superfluity of Blood does not exi&s;t in Women who have been long in a very low and lan|gui&s;hing State.</P>
<P>&sect; 353. Their Di&s;order, however, continues to increa&s;e, as e|very one daily mu&s;t, which does not terminate. This Increa&s;e of it is attributed to the Suppre&s;&s;ion or Non-appearance of their
<PB N="181" REF="012243_0201_0F8A6D3453C0DE98">
monthly Efflux, which is often erroneous; &s;ince the Di&s;order is not always owing to that Suppre&s;&s;ion, which is often the Effect of that Di&s;temperature. This is &s;o true, that even when the Ef|flux happens, if their Weakne&s;s &s;till continues, the Patients are far from being the better for it, but the rever&s;e. Neither is it un|u&s;ual to &s;ee young Lads, who have received from Nature, and from their Parents, a Sort of feminine Con&s;titution, Education, and Habitude, infe&s;ted with much the &s;ame Symptoms, as ob|&s;tructed young Women.</P>
<P>Country Girls, who are generally more accu&s;tomed to &s;uch har|dy Work and Exerci&s;e as Country Men, are le&s;s &s;ubject to the&s;e Complaints, than Women who live in Cities.</P>
<P>&sect; 354. Let People then be careful not to deceive them&s;elves on this important Account; &s;ince all the Complaints of young Mai|dens are not owing to the want of their Cu&s;toms. Neverthele&s;s it is certain there are &s;ome of them, who are really afflicted from this Cau&s;e. For In&s;tance, when a &s;trong young Virgin in full Health, who is nearly arrived to her full Growth, and who manife&s;tly abounds with Blood, does not obtain this Di&s;charge at the u&s;ual time of Life, then indeed this &s;uperfluous Blood is the Fountain of very many Di&s;orders, and greatly more violent ones than tho&s;e, which re&s;ult from the contrary Cau&s;es already mentioned.</P>
<P>If the lazy inactive City Girls are more &s;ubject to the Ob|&s;tructions, which either ari&s;e from the Weakne&s;s and Langour I have formerly taken Notice of, or which accompany it; Coun|try Girls are more &s;ubject to Complaints from this latter Cau&s;e (too great a Retention of &s;uperfluous Blood) than Women who live in Cities: and it is this la&s;t Cau&s;e that excites tho&s;e &s;ingular Di&s;orders, which appear &s;o &s;upernatural to the common People, that they a&s;cribe them to Sorcery.</P>
<P>&sect; 355. And even after the&s;e periodical Di&s;charges have ap|peared, it is known that they have often been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, without the lea&s;t unhealthy Con&s;equence re&s;ulting from that Suppre&s;&s;ion. They are often &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, in the Circum&s;tances mentioned &sect; 351, by a Continuance of the Di&s;ea&s;e, which was fir&s;t an Ob&s;tacle or Retardment to their Appearance; and in other Ca&s;es, they have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by other Cau&s;es, &s;uch as Cold, Moi&s;ture, violent Fear, any very &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ion; by too chilly a Cour&s;e of Diet, with Indige&s;tion; or too hot and irritating Diet; by Drinks cooled with Ice, by Exerci&s;e too long continued, and by unu&s;ual Watching. The Symptoms, occa&s;ioned by &s;uch Suppre&s;&s;ions, are &s;ometimes more violent than tho&s;e, which preceded the fir&s;t Ap|pearance of the Di&s;charge.</P>
<P>&sect; 356. The great Facility with which this Evacuation may be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, dimini&s;hed, or di&s;ordered, by the Cau&s;es already a&s;|&s;igned; the terrible Evils which are the Con&s;equences of &s;uch In|terruptions and Irregularities of them; &s;eem to me very cogent Rea&s;ons to engage the Sex to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Care, in every Re|&s;pect,
<PB N="182" REF="012243_0202_0F8A6D351FCE4DB0">
to pre&s;erve the Regularity of them; by avoiding, during their Approach and Continuance, every Cau&s;e that may prevent or le&s;&s;en them. Would they be thoroughly per&s;uaded, not &s;ole|ly by my Advice, but by that of their Mothers, their Relations, their Friends, and by their own Experience, of what great Im|portance it is to be very attentive to them&s;elves, at tho&s;e critical times, I think there is not one Woman, who from the fir&s;t, to the very la&s;t Appearance of them, would not conduct her&s;elf with the the mo&s;t &s;crupulous Regularity.</P>
<P>Their Demeanour, in the&s;e Circum&s;tances, very fundamentally intere&s;ts their own Health, as well as that of their Children: and con&s;equently their own Happine&s;s, as well as that of their Hu&s;|bands and Families.</P>
<P>The younger and more delicate they are, Caution becomes the more nece&s;&s;ary for them. I am very &s;en&s;ible a &s;trong Country Girl is too negligent in regulating her&s;elf at tho&s;e critical Sea&s;ons, and &s;ometimes without any ill Con&s;equence; but at another time &s;he may &s;uffer feverely for it; and I could produce a long Li&s;t of many, who, by their Imprudence on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, have thrown them&s;elves into the mo&s;t terrible Condition.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Caution with which Females &s;hould avoid the&s;e ge|neral Cau&s;es, ju&s;t mentioned in the preceding Section, every Per|&s;on ought to remember what has mo&s;t particularly di&s;agreed with her during that Term, and forever con&s;tantly to reject it.</P>
<P>&sect; 357. There are many Women who&s;e Cu&s;toms vi&s;it them with|out the &s;lighte&s;t Impeachment of their Health: others are &s;en&s;i|bly di&s;ordered on every Return of them; and to others again they are very tormenting, by the violent Cholics, of a longer or a &s;horter Duration, which precede or accompany them. I have known &s;ome of the&s;e violent Attacks la&s;t but &s;ome Minutes, and others which continued a few Hours. Nay &s;ome indeed have per|&s;i&s;ted for many Days, attended with Vomiting, Fainting, with Convul&s;ions from exce&s;&s;ive Pain, with Vomiting of Blood, Bleed|ings from the No&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which, in &s;hort, have brought them to the very Jaws of Death. So very dangerous a Situation requires the clo&s;e&s;t Attention: though, as it re&s;ults from &s;everal and fre|quently very oppo&s;ite Cau&s;es, it is impo&s;&s;ible, within the pre&s;ent Plan, to direct the Treatment that may be proper for each Indivi|dual. Some Women have the Unhappine&s;s to be &s;ubject to the&s;e Symptoms every Month, from the fir&s;t Appearance, to the final Termination of the&s;e Di&s;charges; except proper Remedies and Regimen, and &s;ometimes a happy Child-birth, remove them. Others complain but now and then, every &s;econd, third, or fourth Month; and there are &s;ome again, who have &s;uffered very &s;evere|ly durng the fir&s;t Months, or Years, after their fir&s;t Eruptions, &s;uffer no more afterwards. A fourth Number, after having had their Cu&s;toms for a long Time, without the lea&s;t Complaint, find them&s;elves afflicted with cruel Pains, at every Return of them; if by Imprudence, or &s;ome inevitable Fatality, they have incurred
<PB N="183" REF="012243_0203_0F8A6D3625287B50">
any Cau&s;e, that has &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, dimini&s;hed, or delayed them. This Con&s;ideration ought to &s;ugge&s;t a proper Caution even to &s;uch, as generally undergo the&s;e Di&s;charges, without Pain or Complaint: &s;ince all may be a&s;&s;ured, that though they &s;uffer no &s;en&s;ible Di&s;order at that Time, they are neverthele&s;s more deli|cate, more impre&s;&s;ible by extraneous Sub&s;tances; more ea&s;ily af|fected by the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind; and have al&s;o weaker Sto|machs at the&s;e particular Periods.</P>
<P>&sect; 358. The&s;e Di&s;charges may al&s;o be &s;ometimes too profu&s;e in Quantity, in which Ca&s;e the Patients become conoxious to very grievous Maladies; into the Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which however I &s;hall not enter here, as they are much le&s;s frequent than tho&s;e, ari&s;ing from a Suppre&s;&s;ion of them. Be&s;ides which, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, Re|cour&s;e may be had to the Directions I &s;hall give hereafter; when I treat of the Quantity of Blood, which it may be expedient to part with, during the Cour&s;e of Gravidation or Pregnancy. See &sect; 365.</P>
<P>&sect; 359. Finally even when they are the mo&s;t regular, after their Continuance for a pretty certain Number of Years (rarely exceeding thirty-five) they go off of their own Accord, and ne|ce&s;&s;arily between the Age of forty-five and fifty; &s;ometimes even &s;ooner, but &s;eldom continuing longer: and this <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> of their cea&s;ing is generally a very trouble&s;ome, and often a very danger|ous one for the Sex.</P>
<P>&sect; 360. The Evils mentioned &sect; 352 may be prevented, by avoid|ing the Cau&s;es producing them; and, 1, by obliging young Mai|dens to u&s;e con&s;iderable Exerci&s;e; e&s;pecially as &s;oon as there is the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the Approach of this Di&s;order, the <HI>Chloro&s;is,</HI> or Green Sickne&s;s.</P>
<P>2. By watching them carefully, that they eat nothing un|whole&s;ome or improper; as there are &s;carcely any natural Sub|&s;tances, even among &s;uch as are mo&s;t improper for them, and the mo&s;t di&s;ta&s;teful, which have not &s;ometimes been the Objects of their &s;ickly, their unaccountable Cravings. Fat Aliments, Pa&s;try, farinaceous or mealy, and &s;our and watery Foods are pernicious to them. Herb-Teas, which are frequently directed as a Medicine for them, are &s;ufficient to throw them into the Di&s;order, by in|crea&s;ing that Relaxation of their Fibres, which is a principal Cau&s;e of it. If they mu&s;t drink any &s;uch Infu&s;ions, as medicated Drinks, let them be taken cold: but the be&s;t Drink for them is Water, in which red hot Iron has been extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>3. They mu&s;t avoid hot &s;harp Medicines, and &s;uch as are &s;olely in|tended to force down their Terms, which are frequently attended with very pernicious Con&s;equences, and never do any good: and they are &s;till the more hurtful, as the Patient is the younger.</P>
<P>4, If the Malady increa&s;es, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give them &s;ome Remedies: but the&s;e &s;hould not be Purges, nor con&s;i&s;t of Diluters, and Decoctions of Herbs, of Salts, and a Heap of other u&s;ele&s;s and noxious Ingredients; but they &s;hould take Filings of
<PB N="184" REF="012243_0204_0F8A6D36C3AD9AC8">
Iron, which is the mo&s;t certain Remedy in &s;uch Ca&s;es. The&s;e Filings &s;hould be of true &s;imple Iron, and not from Steel; and Care &s;hould be taken that it be not ru&s;ty, in which State it has very little Effect.</P>
<P>At the Beginning of this Di&s;temper, and to young Girls, it is &s;ufficient to give twenty Grains daily, enjoining due Exerci&s;e, and a &s;uitable Diet. When it prevails in a more &s;evere Degree, and the Patient is not &s;o young, a Quarter of an Ounce may be &s;afely ventured on: certain Bitters or Aromatics may be advantageou&s;|ly joined to the Filings, which are numbered in the Appendix, 54, 55, 56, and con&s;titute the mo&s;t effectual Remedies in this Di&s;temper, to be taken in the Form of Powder, of vinous Infu|&s;ion, or of Electuary <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>French</HI> Word here, <HI>Opiat,</HI> is &s;ometimes u&s;ed by them for a compound Medicine of the Con&s;i&s;tence of an Electuary: and cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, in this Place, to mean any Preparation, into which <HI>Opium</HI> enters. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE>. When there is a ju&s;t Indication to bring down the Di&s;charge, the vinous Infu&s;ion No. 55 mu&s;t be given, and generally &s;ucceeds: but I mu&s;t again repeat it (as it &s;hould carefully be con&s;idered) that the Stoppage or Ob&s;truction of this Di&s;charge is frequently the Effect, not the Cau&s;e of this Di&s;ea&s;e; and that there &s;hould be no Attempt to force it down, which, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, may &s;ometimes prove more hurtful than beneficial; &s;ince it would naturally return of its own Accord, on the Recovery, and with the Strength, of the Patient: as their Return &s;hould follow that of perfect Health, and neither can precede Health, nor introduce it. There are &s;ome Ca&s;es particularly, in which it would be highly dangerous to u&s;e hot and active Medicines, &s;uch Ca&s;es for In&s;tance, as are attended with &s;ome Degree of Fever, a frequent Coughing, a Haemorrhage or Bleeding, with great Leanne&s;s and con&s;iderable Thir&s;t: all which Complaints &s;hould be removed, before any hot Medicines are given to force this Evacuation, which many very ignorantly imagine cures all other female Di&s;orders; an Error, that has prematurely occa&s;i|oned the Lo&s;s of many Women's Lives.</P>
<P>&sect; 361. While the Patient is under a Cour&s;e of the&s;e Medicines, &s;he &s;hould not take any of tho&s;e I have forbidden in the preceding Sections; and the Efficacy of the&s;e &s;hould al&s;o be furthered with proper Exerci&s;e. That in a Carriage is very healthy; Dancing is &s;o too, provided it be not extended to an Exce&s;s. In Ca&s;e or a Relap&s;e in the&s;e Di&s;orders, the Patient is to be treated, as if it were an original Attack.</P>
<P>&sect; 362. The other Sort of Ob&s;tructions, de&s;cribed &sect; 354, re|quires a very different Treatment. Bleeding, which is hurtful in the former Sort, and the U&s;e, or rather Abu&s;e, of which has thrown &s;everal young Women into irrecoverable Weakne&s;&s;es, has often removed this latter Species, as it were, in a Moment.

<P>&sect; 363. When the&s;e Evacuations naturally cea&s;e through Age (See &sect; 359) if they &s;top &s;uddenly and all at once, and had for|merly flowed very largely, Bleeding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 1, nece&s;&s;arily be direct|ed, and repeated every &s;ix, every four, or even every three Months.</P>
<P>2, The u&s;ual Quantity of Food &s;hould be &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed, e&s;pecially of Fle&s;h, of Eggs, and of &s;trong Drink.</P>
<P>3, Exerci&s;e &s;hould be increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>4, The Patient &s;hould frequently take, in a Morning fa&s;ting, the Powder No. 24, which is very beneficial in &s;uch Ca&s;es; as it moderately increa&s;es the natural Excretions by Stool, Urine, and Per&s;piration; and thence le&s;&s;ens that Quantity of Blood, which would otherwi&s;e &s;uperbound.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, &s;hould this total Ce&s;&s;ation of the monthly Di&s;|charge be preceded by, or attended with, any extraordinary Lo&s;s of Blood, which is frequently the Ca&s;e, Bleeding is not &s;o nece&s;&s;a|ry; but the Regimen and Powder ju&s;t directed are very much &s;o; to which the Purge No. 23 &s;hould now and then be joined, at mo|derate Intervals. The U&s;e of a&s;tringent Medicines at this criti|cal time might di&s;po&s;e the Patient to a Cancer of the Womb.</P>
<P>Many Women die about this Age, as it is but too ea&s;y a Mat|ter to injure them then; a Circum&s;tance that &s;hould make them very cautious and prudent in the Medicines they recur to. On the other hand it al&s;o frequently happens, that their Con&s;titutions al|ter for the better, after this critical time of Life; their Fibres grow &s;tronger; they find them&s;elves &s;en&s;ibly more hearty and hardy; many former &s;light Infirmities di&s;appear, and they enjoy a healthy and happy old Age.

<HEAD>Of Di&s;orders attending Gravidation, or the Term of going with Child.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 364. Gravidation is generally a le&s;s ailing or unhealthy State in the Country, than in very populous Towns. Neverthele&s;s Country Women are &s;ubject, as well as Citizens, to Pains of the Stomach, to vomiting in a Morning, to Head-ach and Tooth-ach; but the&s;e Complaints very commonly yield to Bleeding,

which is almo&s;t the only Remedy nece&s;&s;ary <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Too great a Fulne&s;s of Blood is undoubtedly the Cau&s;e of all the&s;e Com|plaints; but as there are different Methods of oppo&s;ing this Cau&s;e, the gentle&s;t &s;hould always be preferred; nor &s;hould the Con&s;titution become habituated to &s;uch Remedies, as might either impair the Strength of the Mother, or of her Fruit. Some Expedients therefore &s;hould be thought of, that may compen&s;ate for the Want of Bleeding, by enjoining proper Exerci&s;e in a clear Air, with a le&s;s nouri&s;hing, and le&s;s juicy Diet. <HI>E. L.</HI></P>
<P>This Note might have its U&s;e &s;ometimes, in the Ca&s;es of &s;uch delicate and hy&s;terical, yet pregnant Women, as are apt to &s;uffer from Bleeding, or any other Evacuation, though no Ways immoderate. But it &s;hould have been con&s;idered, that Dr. TISSOT was profe&s;&s;edly writing here to hearty active Country Wives, who are very rarely thus con&s;tituted; and whom he might be unwilling to con|fu&s;e with &s;uch multiplied Di&s;tinctions and Directions, as would very &s;eldom be nece&s;&s;ary, and might &s;ometimes prevent them from doing what was &s;o. Be&s;ides which, this Editor might have &s;een, our Author has hinted at &s;uch Ca&s;es very &s;oon after. <HI>K.</HI></P></NOTE> for pregnant Wo|men.</P>
<P>&sect; 365. Sometimes after carrying too heavy Burthens; after too much or too violent Work; after receiving exce&s;&s;ive Jolts, or having had a Fall, they are &s;ubject to violent Pains of the Loins, which extend down to their Thighs, and terminate quite at the Bottom of the Belly; and which commonly &s;ignify, that they are in Danger of an Abortion, or Mi&s;carrying.</P>
<P>To prevent this Con&s;equence, which is always dangerous, they &s;hould, 1, immediately go to Bed; and if they have not a Ma|tra&s;s, they &s;hould lie upon a Bed &s;tuffed with Straw, a Feather-bed being very improper in &s;uch Ca&s;es. They &s;hould repo&s;e, or keep them&s;elves quite &s;till in this Situation for &s;everal Days, not &s;tirring, and &s;peaking as little as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>2, They &s;hould directly lo&s;e eight or nine Ounces of Blood from the Arm.</P>
<P>3, They &s;hould not eat Fle&s;h, Fle&s;h-broth, nor Eggs; but live &s;olely on Soups, made of farinaceous or mealy Sub&s;tances.</P>
<P>4, They &s;hould take every two Hours half a Paper of the Pow|der No. 20; and &s;hould drink nothing but the Pti&s;an No. 2.</P>
<P>Some &s;anguine robu&s;t Women are very liable to mi&s;carry at a certain Time, or Stage, of their Pregnancy. This may be obvi|ated, by their bleeding &s;ome Days before that time approaches, and by their ob&s;erving the Regimen I have advi&s;ed. But this Method would avail very little for delicate Citizens, who mi&s;carry from a very different Cau&s;e; and who&s;e Abortions are to be pre|vented by a very different Treatment.</P>

<HEAD>Of Delivery, or Child-birth.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 366. It has been ob&s;erved that a greater Proportion of Wo|men die in the Country in, or very &s;peedily after, their Delivery, and that from the Scarcity of good A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the great Plenty of what is bad; and that a greater Proportion of tho&s;e in Cities
<PB N="187" REF="012243_0207_0F8A6D398DCF9D30">
die after their Labours are effected, by a Continuance of their for|mer bad Health.</P>
<P>The Nece&s;&s;ity there is for better in&s;tructed, better qualified Mid|wives, through a great Part of <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> is but too manife&s;t an Unhappine&s;s, which is attended with the mo&s;t fatal Con&s;equences, and which merits the utmo&s;t Attention of the Government.</P>
<P>The Errors which are incurred, during actual Labour, are numberle&s;s, and too often indeed are al&s;o irremediable. It would require a whole Book, expre&s;sly for that Purpo&s;e (and in &s;ome Countries there are &s;uch) to give all the Directions that are nece&s;|&s;ary to prevent &s;o many Fatalities: and it would be as nece&s;&s;ary to form a &s;ufficient Number of well-qualified Midwives to compre|hend, and to ob&s;erve them; which exceeds the Plan of the Work I have propo&s;ed. I &s;hall only mark out one of the Cau&s;es, and the mo&s;t injurious one on this Occa&s;ion: This is the Cu&s;tom of giving hot irritating things, whenever the Labour is very painful, or is &s;low; &s;uch as Ca&s;tor, or its Tincture, Saffron, Sage, Rue, Savin, Oil of Amber, Wine, Venice Treacle, Wine burnt with Spices, Coffee, Brandy, Ani&s;eed-Water, Walnut-Water, Fen|nel-Water, and other Drams or &s;trong Liquors. All the&s;e things are &s;o many Poi&s;ons in this Re&s;pect, which very far from pro|moting the Woman's Delivery, render it more difficult by inflam|ing the Womb (which cannot then &s;o well contract it&s;elf) and the Parts, through which the Birth is to pa&s;s, in Con&s;equence of which they &s;well, become more &s;traitened, and cannot yield or be dilated. Sometimes the&s;e &s;timulating hot Medicines al&s;o bring on Haemorrhages, which prove mortal in a few Hours.</P>
<P>&sect; 367. A con&s;iderable Number, both of Mothers and Infants, might be pre&s;erved by the directly oppo&s;ite Method. As &s;oon as a Woman who was in very good Health, ju&s;t before the Approach of her Labour, being robu&s;t and well made, finds her Travel come on, and that it is painful and difficult; far from encouraging tho&s;e premature Efforts which are always de&s;tructive; and from furthering them by the pernicious Medicines I have ju&s;t enume|rated, the Patient &s;hould be bled in the Arm, which will prevent the Swelling and Inflammation; a&s;&s;wage the Pains; relax the Parts, and di&s;po&s;e every thing to a favourable I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>During actual Labour no other Nouri&s;hment &s;hould be allowed, except a little Panada every three Hours, and as much Toa&s;t and Water as the Woman chu&s;es.</P>
<P>Every fourth Hour a Gly&s;ter &s;hould be given, con&s;i&s;ting of a Decoction of Mallows, and a little Oil. In the Intervals between the&s;e Gly&s;ters, &s;he &s;hould be &s;et over a Kind of Stove, or in a pierced ea&s;y Chair, containing a Ve&s;&s;el in which there is &s;ome hot Water: the Pa&s;&s;age &s;hould be gently rubbed with a little Butter; and Stupes wrung out of a Fomentation of &s;imple hot Water, which is the mo&s;t efficacious of any, &s;hould be applied over the Belly.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="012243_0208_0F8A6D3B019DF0C0">The Midwives, by taking this Method, are not only certain of doing no Mi&s;chief, but they al&s;o allow Nature an Opportunity of doing Good: as a great many Labours, which &s;eem difficult at fir&s;t, terminate happily; and this &s;afe and unprecipitate Manner of Proceeding, at lea&s;t affords time to call in further A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Be&s;ides, the Con&s;equences of &s;uch Deliveries are healthy and hap|py; when by pur&s;uing the heating oppre&s;&s;ing Practice, even though the Delivery be effected, both the Mother and Infant have been &s;o cruelly, though unde&s;ignedly, tormented, that both of them frequently peri&s;h.</P>
<P>&sect; 368. I acknowledge the&s;e Means are in&s;ufficient, when the Child is unhappily &s;ituated in the Womb; or when there is an embarra&s;&s;ing Conformation in the Mother: though at lea&s;t they prevent the Ca&s;e from proving wor&s;e, and leave time for calling in Men-Midwives, or other Female ones, who may be better qua|lified.</P>
<P>I beg Leave again to remind the Midwives, that they &s;hould be very cautious of urging their Women to make any forced Ef|forts to forward the Birth, which are extremely injurious to them, and which may render a Delivery very dangerous and embarra&s;|&s;ing, that might otherwi&s;e have been happily effected: and I in|&s;i&s;t the more freely on the Danger attending the&s;e un&s;ea&s;onable Efforts, and on the very great Importance of Patience, as the other very pernicious Practice is become next to univer&s;al among&s;t us.</P>
<P>The Weakne&s;s, in which the labouring Woman appears, makes the By-&s;tanders fearful that &s;he will not have Strength enough to be delivered; which they think abundantly ju&s;tifies them in giving her Cordials; but this Way of Rea&s;oning is very weak and chi|merical. Their Strength, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, is not &s;o very &s;peedily di&s;&s;ipated: the &s;mall light Pains &s;ink them, but in Pro|portion as the Pains become &s;tronger, their Strength ari&s;es; be|ing never deficient, when there is no extraordinary and uncom|mon Symptom; and we may rea&s;onably be a&s;&s;ured, that in a healthy, well formed Woman, meer Weakne&s;s never prevents a Delivery.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Con&s;equences of Labour, or Child-birth.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 369. The mo&s;t u&s;ual Con&s;equences of Child-birth in the Country are, 1, An exce&s;&s;ive Haemorrhage. 2, An Inflammation of the Womb. 3, A &s;udden Suppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Lochia,</HI> or u&s;ual Di&s;charges after Delivery. And, 4, the Fever and other Acci|dents, re&s;ulting from the Milk.</P>
<P>Exce&s;&s;ive Bleedings or Floodings, &s;hould be treated according to the Manner directed, &sect; 365: and if they are very exce&s;&s;ive, Folds of Linen, which have been wrung out of a Mixture of equal Parts of Water and Vinegar, &s;hould be applied to the Bel|ly, the Loins, and the Thighs: the&s;e &s;hould be changed for fre&s;h

moi&s;t ones, as they dry; and &s;hould be omitted, as &s;oon as the Bleeding abates.</P>
<P>&sect; 370. The Inflammation of the Womb is di&s;coverable by Pains in all the lower Parts of the Belly; by a Ten&s;ion or Tight|ne&s;s of the whole; by a &s;en&s;ible Increa&s;e of Pain upon touching it; a Kind of red Stain or Spot, that mounts to the Middle of the Belly, as high as the Navel: which Spot, as the Di&s;ea&s;e in|crea&s;es, turns black, and then is always a mortal Symptom; by a very extraordinary Degree of Weakne&s;s; an a&s;toni&s;hing Change of Countenance; a light <HI>Delirium</HI> or Raving; a continual Fever with a weak and hard Pul&s;e; &s;ometimes ince&s;&s;ant Vomitings; a frequent Hiccup; a moderate Di&s;charge of a reddi&s;h &s;tinking, &s;harp Water; frequent Urgings to go to Stool; a burning Kind of Heat of Urine; and &s;ometimes an entire Suppre&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>&sect; 371. This mo&s;t dangerous and frequently mortal Di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould be treated like inflammatory ones. After Bleeding, fre|quent Gly&s;ters of warm Water mu&s;t by no Means be omitted; &s;ome &s;hould al&s;o be injected into the Womb, and applied conti|nually over the Belly. The Patient may al&s;o drink continually, either of &s;imple Barley-Water, with a Quarter of an Ounce of Nitre in every Part of it, or of Almond Milk No. 4.</P>
<P>&sect; 372. The total Suppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Lochia,</HI> the Di&s;charge af|ter Labour, which proves a Cau&s;e of the mo&s;t violent Di&s;orders, &s;hould be treated exactly in the &s;ame Manner: but if unhappily hot Medicines have been given, in order to force them down, the Ca&s;e will very generally prove a mo&s;t hopele&s;s one.</P>
<P>&sect; 373. If the Milk-fever run very high, the Barley Pti&s;an di|rected &sect; 371, and Gly&s;ters, with a very light Diet con&s;i&s;ting only of Panada, or made of &s;ome other farinaceous Sub&s;tance, and that very thin, very generally remove it.</P>
<P>&sect; 374. Delicate infirm Women, who have not all the requi|&s;ite and nece&s;&s;ary Attendance they want; and &s;uch as from Indi|gence are obliged to work too &s;oon, are expo&s;ed to many Acci|dents, which frequently ari&s;e from a Want of due Per&s;piration, and an in&s;ufficient Di&s;charge of the <HI>Lochia</HI>; and hence the Sepa|ration of the Milk in their Brea&s;ts being di&s;turbed, there are milky Conge&s;tions, or Knots as it were, which are always very painful and trouble&s;ome, and e&s;pecially when they are formed more in|wardly. They often happen on the Thighs, in which Ca&s;e the Pti&s;an No. 58 is to be drank, and the Pultices No. 59 mu&s;t be ap|plied. The&s;e two Remedies gradually di&s;&s;ipate and remove the Tumour, if that may be effected without Suppuration. But if that proves impo&s;&s;ible, and <HI>Pus,</HI> or Matter, is actually formed, a Surgeon mu&s;t open the Ab&s;ce&s;s, and treat it like any other.</P>
<P>&sect; 375. Should the Milk coagulate, or curdle as it were, in the Brea&s;t, it is of the utmo&s;t Importance immediately to attenuate or di&s;&s;olve that Thickne&s;s, which would otherwi&s;e degenerate into a Hardne&s;s and prove a <HI>Scirrhus</HI>; and from a <HI>Scirrhus</HI> in Proce&s;s of Time a Cancer, that mo&s;t tormenting and cruel Di&s;temper.</P>

much neglected by Phy&s;icians; and have been too long confided to the Conduct of the mo&s;t improper Per&s;ons for &s;uch a Charge. At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be admitted, their Health is of no little Importance; their Pre&s;ervation is as nece&s;&s;ary as the Continuance of the human Race; and the Application of the Practice of Phy|&s;ick to their Di&s;orders is &s;u&s;ceptible of nearer Approaches to Per|fection, than is generally conceived. It &s;eems to have even &s;ome Advantage over that Practice which regards grown Per&s;ons; and it con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the Di&s;ea&s;es of Children are more &s;imple, and le&s;s frequently complicated, than tho&s;e of Adults.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid indeed, they cannot make them&s;elves &s;o well un|der&s;tood, and meer Infants certainly not at all. This is true in fact to a certain Degree, but not rigidly true; for though they do not &s;peak our Language, they have one which we &s;hould con|trive to under&s;tand. Nay every Di&s;temper may be &s;aid, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, to have a Language of its own, which an attentive Phy&s;i|cian will learn. He &s;hould therefore u&s;e his utmo&s;t Care to under|&s;tand that of Infants, and avail him&s;elf of it, to increa&s;e the Means of rendering them healthy and vigorous, and to cure them of the different Di&s;tempers to which they are liable. I do not propo&s;e ac|tually to compleat this Ta&s;k my&s;elf, in all that Extent it may ju&s;tly demand; but I &s;hall &s;et forth the principal Cau&s;es of their Di&s;tempers, and the general Method of treating them. By this Means I &s;hall at lea&s;t pre&s;erve them from &s;ome of the Mi&s;chiefs which are too frequently done them; and the le&s;&s;ening &s;uch E|vils as Ignorance, or erroneous Practice, occa&s;ions, is one of the mo&s;t important Purpo&s;es of the pre&s;ent Work.</P>
<P>&sect; 378. Nearly all the Children who die before they are one Year, and even two Years, old, die <HI>with</HI> Convul&s;ions: People &s;ay they died <HI>of</HI> them, which is partly true, as it is in Effect the Con|vul&s;ions that have de&s;troyed them. But then the&s;e very Convul|&s;ions are the Con&s;equences, the Effects, of other Di&s;ea&s;es, which require the utmo&s;t Attention of tho&s;e, who are entru&s;ted with the Care and Health of the little Innocents; as an effectual Oppo&s;i|tion to the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, the&s;e morbid Cau&s;es, is the only Means of removing the Convul&s;ions. The four principal known Cau&s;es are, the <HI>Meconium,</HI> the Excrements contained in the Body of the In|fant, at the Birth; <HI>Acidities,</HI> or &s;harp and &s;our Humours; the Cutting of the Teeth, and Worms. I &s;hall treat briefly of each.</P>

their Mixture a double Source of Evils, to the De&s;truction of the Infant.</P>
<P>The Evacuation of this Excrement is procured, 1, By giving them no Milk at all for the fir&s;t twenty-four Hours of their Lives. 2, By making them drink during that time &s;ome Water, to which a little Sugar or Honey mu&s;t be added, which will dilute this <HI>Me|conium,</HI> and promote the Di&s;charge of it by Stool, and &s;ometimes by vomiting.</P>
<P>To be the more certain of expelling all this Matter, they &s;hould take one Ounce of Compound Syrup <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This Method [&s;ays the Editor and Annotator of <HI>Lyons</HI>] is u&s;eful, whenever the Mother does not &s;uckle her Child.

<PB N="193" REF="012243_0213_0F8A6D3F8A1E2238">
There are but two Purpo&s;es to be pur&s;ued in &s;uch Ca&s;es, which are to carry off the &s;our or &s;harp Humours, and to prevent the Generation of more. The fir&s;t of the&s;e Intentions is be&s;t effected by the Syrup of Succory <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or, for Want of it, the &s;olutive Syrup of Ro&s;es. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE>, ju&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P>The Generation of further Acidities is prevented, by giving three Do&s;es daily, if the Symptoms are violent, and but two, or even one only, if they are very moderate, of the Powder No. 61, drinking after it Bawm Tea, or a Tea of Lime-tree Flowers.</P>
<P>&sect; 381. It has been a Cu&s;tom to load Children with Oil of Al|monds, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Magne&s;ia</HI> is an excellent Sub&s;titute in Children, for the&s;e Oils Dr. TISSOT &s;o ju&s;tly condemns here. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> as &s;oon as ever they are infe&s;ted with Gripes: but it is a pernicious Cu&s;tom, and attended with very dangerous Con&s;equen|ces. It is very true that this Oil &s;ometimes immediately allays the Gripes, by involving, or &s;heathing up, as it were, the acrid Hu|mours, and &s;omewhat blunting the Sen&s;ibility of the Nerves. But it proves only a palliative Remedy, or a&s;&s;waging for a time, which, far from removing, increa&s;es the Cau&s;e, &s;ince it becomes &s;harp and rancid it&s;elf; whence the Di&s;order &s;peedily returns, and the more Oil the Infant takes, it is griped the more. I have cured &s;ome Children of &s;uch Di&s;orders, without any other Remedy, ex|cept ab&s;taining from Oil, which weakens their Stomachs, whence their Milk is le&s;s perfectly, and more &s;lowly dige&s;ted, and becomes more ea&s;ily &s;oured. Be&s;ides this Weakne&s;s of the Stomach, which thus commences at that very early Age, has &s;ometimes an un|healthy Influence on the Con&s;titution of the Child, throughout the Remainder of his Life.</P>
<P>A free and open Belly is beneficial to Children; now it is cer|tain that the Oil very often binds them, in Con&s;equence of its dimini&s;hing the Force and Action of the Bowels. There is &s;carce|ly any Per&s;on, who cannot ob&s;erve this Inconvenience attending it; notwith&s;tanding they all continue to advi&s;e and to give it, to obtain a very different Purpo&s;e: But &s;uch is the Power of Preju|dice in this Ca&s;e, and in &s;o many others; People are &s;o &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a Notion, that &s;uch a Medicine mu&s;t produce &s;uch an Effect, that its never having produced it, avails nothing with them, their Prejudice &s;till prevails; they a&s;cribe its Want of Effi|cacy to the Smallne&s;s of the Do&s;es; the&s;e are doubled then, and notwith&s;tanding its bad Effects are augmented, their ob&s;tinate Blindne&s;s continues.</P>
<P>This Abu&s;e of the Oil al&s;o di&s;po&s;es the Child to knotty hard Tumours, and at length often proves the fir&s;t Cau&s;e of &s;ome Di&s;|ea&s;es of the Skin, who&s;e Cure is extremely difficult.</P>
<P>Hence it is evident, this Oil &s;hould be u&s;ed on &s;uch Occa&s;ions but very &s;eldom; and that it is always very injudicious to give it in Cholics, which ari&s;e from &s;harp and &s;our Humours in the Sto|mach or in the Bowels.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="012243_0214_0F8A6D40539E79E8">&sect; 382. Infants are commonly mo&s;t &s;ubject to &s;uch Cholics dur|ing their earlie&s;t Months; after which they abate, in Proportion as their Stomachs grow &s;tronger. They may be relieved in the Fit by Gly&s;ters of a Decoction of Camomile Flowers, in which a Bit of Soap of the Size of a Hazel Nut is d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ed. A Piece of Flanel wrung out of a Decoction of Camomile Flowers, with the Addition of &s;ome Venice Treacle, and applied hot over the Sto|mach and on the Belly, is al&s;o very beneficial, and relieving.</P>
<P>Children cannot always take Gly&s;ters, the Continuance of which Inability might be dangerous to them; and every one is acquaint|ed with the common Method of &s;ub&s;tituting Suppo&s;itories to them, whether they are formed of the &s;mooth and &s;upple Stalks of Vines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Soap, or of Honey boiled up to a proper Con&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>But one of the mo&s;t certain Means to prevent the&s;e Cholics, which are owing to Children's not dige&s;ting their Milk, is to move and exerci&s;e them as much as po&s;&s;ible; having a due Re|gard however to their tender time of Life.</P>
<P>&sect; 383. Before I proceed to the third Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;es of Children, which is, the Cutting of their Teeth, I mu&s;t take No|tice of the fir&s;t Care their Birth immediately requires, that is, the Wa&s;hing of them the fir&s;t Time, merely to clean&s;e, and after|wards to &s;trengthen them.</P>

<HEAD>Of wa&s;hing Children.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 384. The whole Body of an Infant ju&s;t born is covered with a gro&s;s Humour, which is occa&s;ioned by the Fluids, in which it was &s;u&s;pended in the Womb. There is a Nece&s;&s;ity to clean&s;e it directly from this, for which nothing is &s;o proper as a Mixture of one third Wine, and two thirds Water; Wine alone would be dangerous. This Wa&s;hing may be repeated &s;ome Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly; but it is a bad Cu&s;tom to continue to wa&s;h them thus warm, the Danger of which is augmented by adding &s;ome Butter to the Wine and Water, which is done too often. If this gro&s;s Hu|mour, that covers the Child, &s;eems more thick and glutinous than ordinary, a Decoction of Camomile Flowers, with a little Bit of Soap, may be u&s;ed to remove it. The Regularity of Per&s;piration is the great Foundation of Health; to procure this Regularity the Teguments, the Skin, mu&s;t be &s;trengthened; but warm Wa&s;hing tends to weaken it. When it is of a proper Strength it always performs its Functions; nor is Per&s;piration di&s;ordered &s;en&s;ibly by the Alteration of the Weather. For this Rea&s;on nothing &s;hould be omitted, that may fix it in this State; and to attain &s;o important an Advantage, Children &s;hould be wa&s;hed &s;ome few Days after their Birth, with cold Water, in the State it is brought from the Spring.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e a Spunge is employed, with which they be|gin, by wa&s;hing fir&s;t the Face, the Ears, the back Part of the

This Method which has ob|tained for &s;o many Ages, and which is practi&s;ed at pre&s;ent by many People, who prove very healthy, will appear &s;hocking to &s;everal Mothers; they would be afraid of killing their Children by it; and would particularly fail of Courage enough to endure the Cries, which Children often make, the fir&s;t time they are wa&s;hed. Yet if their Mothers truly love them, they cannot give a more &s;ub&s;tantial Mark of their Tenderne&s;s to them, than by &s;ubduing their Fears and their Repugnance, on this important Head.</P>
<P>Weakly Infants <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There is however a certain Degree of Weakne&s;s, which may very rea&s;ona|bly deter us from this Wa&s;hing; as when the Infant manife&s;tly wants Heat, and needs &s;ome Cordial and frequent Frictions, to prevent its expiring from downright Feeblene&s;s; in which Circum&s;tances Wa&s;hing mu&s;t be hurtful to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; TISSOT.</NOTE> are tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t Need of be|ing wa&s;hed: &s;uch as are remarkably &s;trong may be excu&s;ed from it; and it &s;eems &s;carcely credible (before a Per&s;on has frequently &s;een the Con&s;equences of it) how greatly this Method conduces to give, and to ha&s;ten on, their Strength. I have had the Plea|&s;ure to ob&s;erve, &s;ince I fir&s;t endeavoured to introduce this Cu&s;tom among us, that &s;everal of the mo&s;t affectionate and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Mothers have u&s;ed it with the greate&s;t Succe&s;s. The Midwives, who have been Witne&s;&s;es of it; the Nur&s;es and the Servants of the Children, whom they have wa&s;hed, publi&s;h it abroad; and &s;hould the Cu&s;tom become as general, as every thing &s;eems to promi&s;e it will, I am fully per&s;uaded, that by pre&s;erving the Lives of a great Number of Children, it will certainly contribute to check the Progre&s;s of Depopulation.</P>
<P>They &s;hould be wa&s;hed very regularly every Day, in every Sea|&s;on, and every Sort of Weather; and in the fine warm Sea&s;on they &s;hould be plunged into a large Pail of Wafer, into the Ba|&s;ons around Fountains, in a Brook, a River, or a Lake.</P>
<P>After a few Days, crying, they grow &s;o well accu&s;tomed to this Exerci&s;e, that it become, one of their Plea&s;ures; &s;o that they laugh all the Time of their going through it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Benefit of this Practice is, as I have already &s;aid, the keeping up their Per&s;piration, and rendering them le&s;s obnoxious to the Impre&s;&s;ions of the Air and Weather: and it is al&s;o in Con|&s;equence of this fir&s;t Benefit, that they are pre&s;erved from a great Number of Maladies, e&s;pecially from knotty Tumours, often call|ed Kernels; from Ob&s;tructions; from Di&s;ea&s;es of the Skin, and from Convul&s;ions; its general Con&s;equence being to in&s;ure them firm, and even robu&s;t Health.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="012243_0216_0F8A6D41D037A450">&sect; 385. But Care &s;hould be taken not to prevent, or, as it were to undo, the Benefit this Wa&s;hing procures them, by the bad Cu&s;|tom of keeping them too hot. There is not a more pernicious one than this, nor one that de&s;troys more Children. They &s;hould be accu&s;tomed to light Cloathing by Day, and light Covering by Night, to go with their Heads very thinly covered, and not at all in the Day-time, after their attaining the Age of two Years, They &s;hou|d avoid &s;leeping in Chambers that are too hot, and &s;hould live in the open Air, both in Summer and Winter, as much as po&s;&s;ible. Children who have been kept too hot in &s;uch Re|&s;pects, are very often liable to Colds; they are weakly, pale, lan|gui&s;hing, bloated and melancholly. They are &s;ubject to hard, knotty Swellings, a Con&s;umption, all Sorts of languid Di&s;orders, and either die in their Infancy, or only grow up into a mi&s;erable valetudinary Life: while tho&s;e who are wa&s;hed or plunged into cold Water, and habitually expo&s;ed to the open Air, are ju&s;t in the oppo&s;ite Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>&sect; 386. I mu&s;t further add here, that Infancy is not the only Stage of Life in which cold Bathing is advantageous. I have ad|vi&s;ed it with remarkable Succe&s;s to Per&s;ons of every Age, even to that of &s;eventy: and there are two Kinds of Di&s;ea&s;es, more fre|quent indeed in Cities than in the Country, in which cold Baths &s;ucceed very greatly; that is, in Debility or Weakne&s;s of the Nerves; and when Per&s;piration is di&s;ordered, when Per&s;ons are fearful of every Breath of Air, liable to Defluctions or Colds, fee|ble and langui&s;hing, the cold Bath re-e&s;tabli&s;hes Per&s;piration; re&s;tores Strength to the Nerves; and by that Means di&s;pels all the Di&s;orders, which ari&s;e from the&s;e two Cau&s;es, in the animal Oeconomy. It &s;hould be u&s;ed before Dinner. But in the &s;ame Proportion that cold Bathing is beneficial, the habitual U&s;e, or rather Abu&s;e, of warm Baths, is pernicious; they di&s;po&s;e the Per&s;ons addicted to them to the Apoplexy; to the Drop&s;y; to Vapours, and to the hypochondriacal Di&s;ea&s;e: and Cities, in which they are too frequently u&s;ed, become, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, de&s;olate from &s;uch Di&s;tempers.</P>

<P>&sect; 388. The <HI>Meconium,</HI> the Acidity of the Milk, and Cutting of the Teeth are the three great Cau&s;es of the Di&s;ea&s;es of Chil|dren. There is al&s;o a fourth, Worms, which is likewi&s;e very of|ten pernicious to them; but which, neverthele&s;s, is not, at lea&s;t not near &s;o much, a general Cau&s;e of their Di&s;orders, as it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, when a Child exceeding two Years of Age proves &s;ick. There are a great Variety of Symptoms, which di&s;|po&s;e People to think a Child has Worms; though there is but one that demon&s;trates it, which is di&s;charging them upwards or downwards. There is great Difference among Children too in this Re&s;pect, &s;ome remaining healthy, though having &s;everal Worms, and others being really &s;ick with a few.</P>
<P>They prove hurtful, 1, by ob&s;tructing the Guts, and compre&s;&s;|ing the neighbouring Bowels by their Size. 2, By &s;ucking up the Chyle intended to nouri&s;h the Patient, and thus depriving him of his very Sub&s;tance as well as Sub&s;i&s;tence: and, 3, by irritating the Guts and even <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have &s;een a Child about three Years old, who&s;e Navel, after &s;welling and inflaming, &s;uppurated, and through a &s;mall Orifice (which mu&s;t have commu|nicated with the Cavity of the Gut or the Belly) di&s;charged one of tho&s;e Worms we call <HI>teretes,</HI> about three Inches long.

<HEAD>Of Convul&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 391. I have already &s;aid, &sect; 378, that the Convul&s;ions of Children are almo&s;t con&s;tantly the Effect of &s;ome other Di&s;ea&s;e, and e&s;pecially of &s;ome of the four I have mentioned. Some o|ther, though le&s;s frequent Cau&s;es, &s;ometimes occa&s;ion them, and the&s;e may be reduced to the following.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of them is the corrupted Humours, that often abound in their Stomachs and Inte&s;tines; and which, by their Irritation, produce irregular Motions throughout the whole Sy&s;tem of the Nerves, or at lea&s;t through &s;ome Parts of them; whence the&s;e Convul&s;ions ari&s;e, which are merely involuntary Motions of the Mu&s;cles. The&s;e putrid Humours are the Con&s;equence of too great a Load of Aliments, of un&s;ound ones, or of &s;uch as the Stomachs of Children are incapable of dige&s;ting. The&s;e Humours are al|&s;o &s;ometimes the Effect of a Mixture and Confu&s;ion of different Aliments, and of a bad Di&s;tribution of their Nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>It may be known that the Convul&s;ions of a Child are owing to this Cau&s;e, by the Circum&s;tances that have preceded them; by a di&s;gu&s;ted loathing Stomach; by a certain Heavine&s;s and Load at it; by a foul Tongue; a threat Belly; by its bad Complexion, and by its di&s;turbed unrefre&s;hing Sleep.</P>
<P>The Child's proper Diet, that is, a certain Diminution of the Quantity of its Food; &s;ome Gly&s;ters of warm Water, and one Purge of No. 63, generally remove &s;uch Convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>&sect; 392. The &s;econd Cau&s;e is the bad Quality of their Milk. Whether it be that the Nur&s;e has fallen into a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ome con&s;iderable Di&s;gu&s;t, great Fright or frequent Fear: whe|ther &s;he has eat unwhole&s;ome Food, drank too much Wine, &s;pi|rituous Liquors, or any &s;trong Drink: whether &s;he is &s;eized with a De&s;cent of her monthly Di&s;charges, which may have greatly di&s;ordered her Health; or finally whether &s;he prove really &s;ick: In all the&s;e Ca&s;es the Milk is vitiated, and expo&s;es the Infant to violent Symptoms, which &s;ometimes &s;peedily de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>The Remedies for Convul&s;ions, from this Cau&s;e, con&s;i&s;t, 1, In letting the Child ab&s;tain from this corrupted Milk, until the Nur&s;e &s;hall have recovered her State of Health and Tranquillity, the &s;peedy Attainment of which may be forwarded by a few Gly&s;|ters; by gentle pacific Medicines; by an entire Ab&s;ence of what|ever cau&s;ed or conduced to her bad Health; and by drawing off all the Milk that had been &s;o vitiated.</P>
<P>2, In giving the Child it&s;elf &s;ome Gly&s;ters: in making it drink plentifully of a light Infu&s;ion of the Flowers of the Lime-tree; in giving it no other Nouri&s;hment for a Day or two, except Pana|da and other light Spoon-meat, without Milk.</P>
<P>3, In purging the Child (&s;uppo&s;ing what has been ju&s;t direct|ed to have been unavailable) with an Ounce, or an Ounce and a Half, of compound Syrup of Succory, or as much Manna.
<PB N="200" REF="012243_0220_0F8A6D4650E1BB48">
The&s;e lenient gentle Purges carry off the Remainder of the cor|rupted Milk, and remove the Di&s;orders occa&s;ioned by it.</P>
<P>&sect; 393. A third Cau&s;e which al&s;o produces Convul&s;ions, is the feveri&s;h Di&s;tempers which attack Children, e&s;pecially the Small-Pocks and the Mea&s;les; but in general &s;uch Convul&s;ions require no other Treatment, but that proper for the Di&s;ea&s;e, which has introduced them.</P>
<P>&sect; 394. It is evident from what has been &s;aid in the Cour&s;e of this Chapter, and it de&s;erves to be attended to, that Convul&s;ions are commonly a Symptom attending &s;ome other Di&s;ea&s;e, rather than an original Di&s;ea&s;e them&s;elves: that they depend on many different Cau&s;es; that from this Con&s;ideration there can be no ge|neral Remedy for removing or checking them; and that the only Means and Medicines which are &s;uitable in each Ca&s;e, are tho&s;e which are proper to oppo&s;e the particular Cau&s;e producing them, and which I have already pointed out in treating of each Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The greater Part of the pretended Specifics, which are indi&s;|criminately and ignorantly employed in all Sorts of Convul&s;ions, are often u&s;ele&s;s, and &s;till oftner prejudicial. Of this la&s;t Sort and Character are,</P>
<P>1, All &s;harp and hot Medicines, &s;pirituous Liquors, Oil of Am|ber, other hot Oils and E&s;&s;ences, volatile Salts, and &s;uch other Medicines as, by the Violence of their Action on the irritable Or|gans of Children, are likelier to produce Convul&s;ions, than to allay them.</P>
<P>2, A&s;tringent Medicines, which are highly pernicious, whene|ver the Convul&s;ions are cau&s;ed by any &s;harp Humour, that ought to be di&s;charged from the Body by Stool; or when &s;uch Con|vul&s;ions are the Con&s;equences of an <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This very important Con&s;ideration, on which I have treated pretty largely, in the <HI>Analy&s;is,</HI> &s;eems not to be attended to in Practice, &s;o frequently as it ought. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> Effort of Nature, in order to effect a <HI>Cri&s;is</HI>: And as they almo&s;t ever depend on one or the other of the&s;e Cau&s;es, it follows that A&s;tringents can very rare|ly, if ever, be beneficial. Be&s;ides that there is always &s;ome Dan|ger in giving them to Children, without a mature, a thorough Con&s;ideration of their particular Ca&s;e and Situation, as they of|ten di&s;po&s;e them to Ob&s;tructions.</P>
<P>3, The over early, and too con&s;iderable U&s;e of Opiates, ei|ther not properly indicated, or continued too long, &s;uch as Ve|nice Treacle, Mithridate, Syrup of Poppies (and it is very ea&s;y to run upon &s;ome of the&s;e Sholes) are al&s;o attended with the mo&s;t embarra&s;&s;ing Events, in Regard to Convul&s;ions; and it may be affirmed they are improper, for nine Tenths of tho&s;e they are advi&s;ed to. It is true they often produce an apparent Ea&s;e and Tranquillity for &s;ome Minutes, and &s;ometimes for &s;ome Hours too; but the Di&s;order returns even with greater Violence for this Su&s;pen&s;ion, by Rea&s;on they have augmented all the Cau&s;es pro|ducing

it; they impair the Stomach; they bind up the Belly; they le&s;&s;en the u&s;ual Quantity of Urine; and be&s;ides, by their abating the Sen&s;ibility of the Nerves (which ought to be con&s;ider|ed as one of the chief Centinels appointed by Nature, for the Di&s;covery of any approaching Danger) they di&s;po&s;e the Patient in&s;en&s;ibly to &s;uch Infarctions and Ob&s;tructions, as tend &s;peedily to produce &s;ome violent and mortal Event, or which generate a Di&s;|po&s;ition to languid and tedious Di&s;ea&s;es: and I do again repeat it, that notwith&s;tanding there are &s;ome Ca&s;es, in which they are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, they ought in general to be employed with great Precaution and Prudence. To mention the principal Indi|cations for them in convul&s;ive Ca&s;es, they are proper,</P>
<P>1, When the Convul&s;ions &s;till continue, after the original Cau&s;e of them is removed.</P>
<P>2, When they are &s;o extremely violent, as to threaten a great and very &s;peedy Danger of Life; and when they prove an Ob&s;ta|cle to the taking Remedies calculated to extingui&s;h their Cau&s;e; and,</P>
<P>3, When the Cau&s;e producing them is of &s;uch a Nature, as is apt to yield to the Force of Anodynes; as when, for In&s;tance, they have been the immediate Con&s;equence of a Fright.</P>
<P>&sect; 395. There is a very great Difference in different Children, in Re&s;pect to their being more or le&s;s liable to Convul&s;ions. There are &s;ome, in whom very &s;trong and irritating Cau&s;es cannot ex|cite them; not even excruciating Gripes and Cholics; the mo&s;t painful Cutting of their Teeth; violent Fevers; the Small-Pocks; Mea&s;les; and though they are, as it were, continually corroded by Worms, they have not the &s;lighte&s;t Tendency to be convul&s;|ed. On the other Hand, &s;ome are &s;o very obnoxious to Con|vul&s;ions, or &s;o ea&s;ily <HI>convul&s;ible,</HI> if that Expre&s;&s;ion may be allow|ed, that they are very often &s;eized with them from &s;uch very &s;light Cau&s;es, that the mo&s;t attentive Con&s;ideration cannot inve&s;tigate them. This Sort of Con&s;titution, which is extremely danger|ous, and expo&s;es the unhappy Subject of it, either to a very &s;peedy Death, or to a very low and languid State of Health, re|quires &s;ome peculiar Con&s;iderations; the Detail of which would be the more foreign to the De&s;ign of this Treati&s;e, as they are pretty common in Cities, but much le&s;s &s;o in Country Places. In general cold Bathing and the Powder No. 14 are &s;erviceable in &s;uch Circum&s;tances.</P>

<HEAD>General Directions with Re&s;pect to Children.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 396. I &s;hall conclude this Chapter by &s;uch farther Advice, as may contribute to give Children a more vigorous Con&s;titution and Temperament, and to pre&s;erve them from many Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, we &s;hould be careful not to cram them too much, and to regulate both the Quantity and the &s;et Time of their Meals, which is a very practicable Thing, even in the very ear|lie&s;t
<PB N="202" REF="012243_0222_0F8A6D4855C61CA8">
Days of their Life; when the Woman who nur&s;es them will be careful to do it regularly. Perhaps indeed this is the very Age, when &s;uch a Regulation may be the mo&s;t ea&s;ily attempted and effected; becau&s;e it is that Stage, when the con&s;tant Uni|formity of their Way of living &s;hould incline us to &s;uppo&s;e, that what they have Occa&s;ion for is mo&s;t con&s;tantly very much the &s;ame.</P>
<P>A Child who has already attained to a few Years, and who is &s;urrendered up more to his own Exerci&s;e and Vivacity, feels other Calls; his Way of Life is become a little more various and irre|gular; whence his Appetite mu&s;t prove &s;o too. Hence it would be inconvenient to &s;ubject him over exactly to one certain Rule, in the Quantity of his Nouri&s;hment, or the Di&s;tance of his Meals. The Di&s;&s;ipation or pa&s;&s;ing off of his Nutrition being unequal, the Occa&s;ions he has for repairing it cannot be preci&s;ely &s;tated and re|gular. But with Re&s;pect to very little Children in Arms, or on the Lap, a Uniformity in the fir&s;t of the&s;e Re&s;pects, the Quan|tity of their Food, very con&s;i&s;tently conduces to a u&s;eful Regu|larity with Re&s;pect to the &s;econd, the Times of feeding them. Sickne&s;s is probably the only Circum&s;tance, that can warrant any Alteration in the Order and Intervals of their Meals; and then this Change &s;hould con&s;i&s;t in a Diminution of their u&s;ual Quantity, notwith&s;tanding a general and fatal Conduct &s;eems to e&s;tabli&s;h the very Rever&s;e: and this pernicious Fa&s;hion authorizes the Nur&s;es to cram the&s;e poor little Creatures the more, in Pro|portion as they have real Need of le&s;s feeding. They conclude of Cour&s;e, that all their Cries are the Effects of Hunger, and the Moment an Infant begins, then they immediately &s;top his Mouth with his Food; without once &s;u&s;pecting, that the&s;e Wail|ings may be occa&s;ioned by the Unea&s;ine&s;s, which an over-loaded Stomach may have introduced; or by Pains, who&s;e Cau&s;e is nei|ther removed nor mitigated, by making the Children eat; though the meer Action of eating may render them in&s;en&s;ible to &s;light Pains, for a very few Minutes; in the fir&s;t Place, by calling off their Attention; and &s;econdly, by hu&s;hing them to &s;leep, a com|mon Effect of feeding Children, being in fact a very general and con&s;tant one, and depending on the &s;ame Cau&s;es, which di&s;po&s;e &s;o many grown Per&s;ons to &s;leep after Meals.</P>
<P>A Detail of the many Evils Children are expo&s;ed to, by thus forcing too much Food upon them, at the very Time when their Complaints are owing to Cau&s;es, very different from Hunger, might appear incredible. They are however &s;o numerous and certain, that I &s;eriou&s;ly wi&s;h &s;en&s;ible Mothers would open their Eyes to the Con&s;ideration of this Abu&s;e, and agree to put an End to it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who overload them with Victuals, in Hopes of &s;treng|thening them, are extremely deceived; there being no one Pre|judice equally fatal to &s;uch a Number of them. Whatever un|nece&s;&s;ary Aliment a Child receives, weakens, in&s;tead of &s;treng|thening him. The Stomach, when overdi&s;tended, &s;uffers in its
<PB N="203" REF="012243_0223_0F8A6D4A70C0CA08">
Force and Functions, and becomes le&s;s able to dige&s;t thoroughly. The Exce&s;s of the Food la&s;t received impairs the Concoction of the Quantity, that was really nece&s;&s;ary; which, being badly di|ge&s;ted, is &s;o far from yielding any Nouri&s;hment to the Infant, that it weakens it, proves a Source of Di&s;ea&s;es, and concurs to pro|duce Ob&s;tructions, Rickets, the Evil, &s;low Fevers, a Con&s;ump|tion and Death.</P>
<P>Another unhappy Cu&s;tom prevails, with regard to the Diet of Children, when they begin to receive any other Food be&s;ides their Nur&s;e's Milk, and that is, to give them &s;uch as exceeds the dige&s;tive Power of their Stomachs; and to indulge them in a Mixture of &s;uch Things in their Meals, as are hurtful in them|&s;elves, and more particularly &s;o, with regard to their feeble and delicate Organs.</P>
<P>To ju&s;tify this pernicious Indulgence, they affirm it is nece&s;&s;ary to accu&s;tom their Stomachs to every Kind of Food; but this No|tion is highly ab&s;urd, &s;ince their Stomachs &s;hould fir&s;t be &s;treng|thened, in order to make them capable of dige&s;ting every Food; and crouding indige&s;tible, or very difficultly dige&s;tible Materials in|to it, is not the Way to &s;trengthen it. To make a Foal &s;ufficiently &s;trong for future Labour, he is exempted from any, till he is four Years old; which enables him to &s;ubmit to con&s;iderable Work, without being the wor&s;e for it. But if, to inure him to Fatigue, he &s;hould be accu&s;tomed immediately from his Birth to &s;ubmit to Burthens above his Strength, he could never prove any thing but an utter Jade, incapable of real Service. The Application of this to the Stomach of a Child is plainly obvious.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add another very important Remark, and it is this, that the too early Work to which the Children of Pea&s;ants are forced, become of real Prejudice to the Publick. Hence Families them|&s;elves are le&s;s numerous, and the more Children there are removed from their Parents, while they are very young, it follows, that tho&s;e who are left are obliged to work the more, and very often even at hard Labour, at an Age when they &s;hould exerci&s;e them|&s;elves in the u&s;ual Diver&s;ions and Sports of Children. Hence they wear out in a Manner, before they attain the ordinary Term of Manhood; they never arrive at their utmo&s;t Strength, nor reach their full Stature; and it is too common to &s;ee a Counte|nance with the Look of twenty Years, joined to a Stature of twelve or thirteen. In fact, they often &s;ink under the Weight of &s;uch hard involuntary Labour, and fall into a mortal Degree of Wa&s;ting and Exhau&s;tion.</P>
<P>&sect; 397. Secondly, which indeed is but a Repetition of the Ad|vice I have already given, and upon which I cannot in&s;i&s;t too much, they mu&s;t be frequently wa&s;hed or bathed in cold Water.</P>
<P>&sect; 398. Thirdly, they &s;hould be moved about and exerci&s;ed as much as they can bear, after they are &s;ome Weeks old: the earlier Days of their tender Lives &s;eeming con&s;ecrated, by Nature her|&s;elf, to a nearly total Repo&s;e, and to &s;leeping, which &s;eems not
<PB N="204" REF="012243_0224_0F8A6D4B8D1B1658">
to determine, until they have Need of Nouri&s;hment: &s;o that, during this very tender Term of Life, too much Agitation or Ex|erci&s;e might be attended with mortal Con&s;equences. But as &s;oon as their Organs have attained a little more Solidity and Firmne&s;s, the more they are danced about (provided it is not done about their u&s;ual Time of Repo&s;e, which ought &s;till to be very con&s;i|derable) they are &s;o much the better for it; and by increa&s;ing it gradually, they may be accu&s;tomed to a very quick Movement, and at length very &s;afely to &s;uch, as may be called hard and hear|ty Exerci&s;e. That Sort of Motion they receive in Go-Carts, or other Vehicles, particularly contrived for their U&s;e, is more be|neficial to them, than what they have from their Nur&s;es Arms, becau&s;e they are in a better Attitude in the former, and it heats them le&s;s in Summer, which is a Circum&s;tance of no &s;mall Im|portance to them; con&s;iderable Heat and Sweat di&s;po&s;ing them to be ricketty.</P>
<P>&sect; 399. Fourthly, they &s;hould be accu&s;tomed to breathe in the free open Air as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If Children have unhappily been le&s;s attended to than they ought, whence they are evidently feeble, thin, languid, ob&s;truct|ed, and liable to Scirrho&s;ities (which con&s;titute what is termed a ricketty or con&s;umptive State) the&s;e four Directions duly ob&s;erved retrieve them from that unhappy State; provided the Execution of them has not been too long delayed.</P>
<P>&sect; 400. Fifthly, If they have any natural Di&s;charge of a Hu|mour by the Skin, which is very common with them, or any Eruption, &s;uch as Tetters, white Scurf, a Ra&s;he, or the like, Care mu&s;t be taken not to check or repel them, by any grea&s;y or re|&s;tringent Applications Not a Year pa&s;&s;es without Numbers of Children having been de&s;troyed by Imprudence in this Re&s;pect; while others have been reduced to a deplorable and weakly Ha|bit.</P>
<P>I have been a Witne&s;s to the mo&s;t unhappy Con&s;equences of ex|ternal Medicines applied for the Ra&s;he and white Scurf; which, however frightful they may appear, are never dangerous; pro|vided nothing at all is applied to them, without the Advice and Con&s;ideration of a truly &s;kilful Per&s;on.</P>
<P>When &s;uch external Di&s;orders prove very ob&s;tinate, it is rea|&s;onable to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome Fault or Di&s;agreement in the Milk the Child &s;ucks; in which Ca&s;e it &s;hould immediately be di&s;continued, corrected, or changed. But I cannot enter here into a particu|lar Detail of all the Treatment nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVIII. Directions with re&s;pect to drowned Per&s;ons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Misfortune of a young Man drowned in bathing him&s;elf, at the Be|ginning of the Sea&s;on, occa&s;ioned the Publication of this Chapter by it&s;elf in <HI>June</HI> 1761. A few Days after, the like Misfortune happened to a labouring Man; but he was happily taken out of the Water &s;ooner than the fir&s;t (who had remained about Half an Hour under it) and he was recovered by ob&s;erving Part of the Advice this Chapter contains; of which Chapter &s;everal By-&s;tanders had Copies.&mdash;This Note &s;eems to be from the Author him&s;elf.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 401. WHENEVER a Per&s;on who has been drowned, has re|mained a Quarter of an Hour under Water, there can be no con&s;iderable Hope of his Recovery; the Space of two or three Minutes in &s;uch a Situation being often &s;ufficient to kill a Man ir|recoverably. Neverthele&s;s, as &s;everal Circum&s;tances may happen to have continued Life, in &s;uch an unfortunate Situation, beyond the ordinary Term, we &s;hould always endeavour to afford them the mo&s;t effectual Relief, and not give them up as irrecoverable too &s;oon: &s;ince it has often been known, that until the Expiration of two, and &s;ometimes even of three Hours, &s;uch Bodies have ex|hibited &s;ome apparent Tokens of Life.</P>
<P>Water has &s;ometimes been found in the Stomachs of drowned Per&s;ons; at other times none at all. Be&s;ides the greate&s;t Quan|tity which has ever been found in it has not exceeded that, which may be drank without any Inconvenience; whence we may con|clude, the meer Quantity was not mortal; neither is it very ea&s;y to conceive how drowning Per&s;ons can &s;wallow Water. What re|ally kills them is meer Suffocation, or the Interception of Air, of the Action of Breathing; and the Water which de&s;cends into the Lungs, and which is determined there, by the Efforts they ne|ce&s;&s;arily, though involuntarily make, to draw Breath, after they are under Water: for there ab&s;olutely does not any Water de|&s;cend, either into the Stomach or the Lungs of Bodies plunged into Water, after they are dead; a Circum&s;tance which &s;erves to e&s;tabli&s;h a legal Sentence and Judgment, in &s;ome criminal Ca&s;es and Trials. This Water, intimately blending it&s;elf with the Air in the Lungs, forms a vi&s;cid inactive Kind of Froth, which en|tirely de&s;troys the Functions of the Lungs; whence the mi&s;era|ble Sufferer is not only &s;uffocated, but the Return of the Blood from the Head being al&s;o intercepted, the Blood Ve&s;&s;els of the Brain are overcharged, and an Apoplexy is combined with the
<PB N="206" REF="012243_0226_0F8A6D4C4ED28A58">
Suffocation. This &s;econd Cau&s;e, that is, the De&s;cent of the Water into the Lungs, is far from being general; it having been evident from the Di&s;&s;ection of &s;everal drowned Bodies, that it really never had exi&s;ted in them.</P>
<P>&sect; 402. The Intention that &s;hould be pur&s;ued, is that of un|loading the Lungs, and the Brain, and of reviving the extingui&s;hed Circulation. For which Purpo&s;e we &s;hould, 1, immediately &s;trip the Sufferer of all his wet Cloaths; rub him &s;trongly with dry coar&s;e Linen; put him, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible into a well heated Bed, and continue to rub him well a very con&s;iderable time together.</P>
<P>2, A &s;trong and healthy Per&s;on &s;hould force his own warm Breath into the Patient's Lungs; and al&s;o the Smoke of Tobac|co, if &s;ome was at Hand, by Means of &s;ome Pipe, Chanel, Fun|nel or the like, that may be introduced into the Mouth. This Air or Fume, being forcibly blown in, by &s;topping the Sufferer's No&s;trils clo&s;e at the &s;ame Time, penetrates into the Lungs, and there rarifies by its Heat that Air, which blended with the Water, compo&s;ed the vi&s;cid Spume or Froth. Hence that Air becomes di&s;engaged from the Water, recovers its Spring, dilates the Lungs; and, if there &s;till remains within any Principle of Life, the Circulation is renewed again that In&s;tant.</P>
<P>3, If a moderately expert Surgeon is at Hand, he mu&s;t open the jugular Vein, or any large Vein in the Neck, and let out ten or twelve Ounces of Blood. Such a Bleeding is &s;erviceable on many Accounts. Fir&s;t, merely as Bleeding, it renews the Circulation, which is the con&s;tant Effect of Bleeding in &s;uch Swoonings, as ari&s;e from an intercepted or &s;uffocated Circulation. Secondly, it is that particular Bleeding, which mo&s;t &s;uddenly removes, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, the Infarction or Ob&s;truction of the Head and Lungs: and, thirdly, it is &s;ometimes the only Ve&s;&s;el, whence Blood will i&s;&s;ue under &s;uch Circum&s;tances. The Veins of the Feet then af|ford none; and tho&s;e of the Arms &s;eldom; but the Jugulars al|mo&s;t con&s;tantly furni&s;h it.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the Fume of Tobacco &s;hould be thrown up, as &s;peedily and plentifully as po&s;&s;ible, into the Inte&s;tines by the Fun|dament. There are very commodious Contrivances devi&s;ed for this Purpo&s;e; but as they are not common, it may be effected by many &s;peedy Means. One, by which a Woman's Life was pre|&s;erved, con&s;i&s;ted only in introducing the &s;mall Tube of a Tobac|co Pipe well lighted up: the Head or Bowl of it was wrapped up in a Paper, in which &s;everal Holes were pricked, and through the&s;e the Breath was &s;trongly forced. At the fifth Bla&s;t a con&s;i|derable Rumbling was heard in the Woman's Belly; &s;he threw up a little Water, and a Moment afterwards came to her Sen&s;es. Two Pipes may be thus lighted and applied, with their Bowls co|vered over; the Extremity of one is to be introduced into the Fundament; and the other may be blown through into the Lungs.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="012243_0227_0F8A6D4D07255C68">Any other Vapour may al&s;o be conveyed up, by introducing a <HI>Canula,</HI> or any other Pipe, with a Bladder firmly fixed to it. This Bladder is fa&s;tened at its other End to a large Tin Funnel, under which Tobacco is to be lighted. This Contrivance has &s;ucceeded with me upon other Occa&s;ions, in which Nece&s;&s;ity compelled me to invent and apply it.</P>
<P>Fifthly, the &s;tronge&s;t Volatiles &s;hould be applied to the Patient's No&s;trils. The Powder of &s;ome &s;trong dry Herb &s;hould be blown up his No&s;e, &s;uch as Sage, Ro&s;emary, Rue, Mint, and e&s;pecially Marjoram, or very well dried Tobacco; or even the Fume, the Smoke of the&s;e Herbs. But all the&s;e Means are mo&s;t properly employed after Bleeding, when they are mo&s;t efficacious and cer|tain.</P>
<P>Sixthly, as long as the Patient &s;hews no Signs of Life, he will be unable to &s;wallow, and it is then u&s;ele&s;s, and even dangerous, to pour much Liquid of any Kind into his Mouth, which could do nothing but keep up, or increa&s;e Suffocation. It is &s;ufficient, in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, to in&s;til a few Drops of &s;ome irritating Li|quor, which might al&s;o be cordial and reviving. But as &s;oon as ever he di&s;covers any Motion, he &s;hould take, within the Space of one Hour, five or &s;ix common Spoonfuls of Oxymel of Squills di|luted with warm Water: or, if that Medicine was not to be had very &s;peedily, a &s;trong Infu&s;ion of the ble&s;&s;ed Thi&s;tle, or <HI>Carduus benedictus,</HI> of Sage, or of Chamomile Flowers &s;weetened with Ho|ney, might do in&s;tead of it: and &s;uppo&s;ing nothing el&s;e to be had, &s;ome warm Water, with the Addition of a little common Salt, &s;hould be given. Some Per&s;ons are bold enough to recommend Vomits in &s;uch Ca&s;es; but they are not without their Inconveni|ence; and it is not as a Vomit that I recommend the Oxymel of Squills in them.</P>
<P>Seventhly, notwith&s;tanding the Sick di&s;cover &s;ome Tokens of Life, we &s;hould not cea&s;e to continue our A&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;ince they &s;ometimes irrecoverably expire, after the&s;e fir&s;t Appearances of re|covering.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, though they &s;hould be manife&s;tly re-animated, there &s;ometimes remains an Oppre&s;&s;ion, a Coughing and Feveri&s;hne&s;s, which effectually con&s;titute a Di&s;ea&s;e: and then it becomes nece&s;|&s;ary &s;ometimes to bleed them in the Arms; to give them Barley Water plentifully, or Elder flower Tea.</P>
<P>&sect; 403. Having thus pointed out &s;uch Means as are nece&s;&s;ary, and truly effectual, in &s;uch unfortunate Accidents, I &s;hall very briefly mention &s;ome others, which it is the general Cu&s;tom to re|cur to and apply in the fir&s;t Hurry.</P>
<P>1, The&s;e unhappy People are &s;ometimes wrapped up in a Sheep's, or a Calf's, or a Dog's Skin, immediately flead from the Ani|mal: &s;uch Applications have &s;ometimes indeed revived the Heat of the Drowned; but their Operations are more &s;low, and le&s;s ef|ficacious, than the Heat of a well-warmed Bed; with the additi|onal
<PB N="208" REF="012243_0228_0F8A6D4DE2B9F038">
Vapour of burnt Sugar, and long continued Frictions with hot Flanels.</P>
<P>2, The Method of rolling them in an empty Hog&s;head, is dan|gerous, and mi&s;pends a deal of important Time.</P>
<P>3, That al&s;o of hanging them up by the Feet is attended with Danger, and ought to be wholly di&s;continued. The Froth or Foam, which is one of the Cau&s;es of their Death, is too thick and tough to di&s;charge it&s;elf, in Con&s;equence of its own Weight.

<P>&sect; 404. It is &s;ome Years &s;ince a Girl of eighteen Years old was recovered [though it is unknown whether &s;he remained under Wa|ter only a little Time or &s;ome Hours] who was motionle&s;s, fro|zen as it were, in&s;en&s;ible, with her Eyes clo&s;ed, her Mouth wide open, a livid Colour, a &s;woln Vi&s;age, a Tumour or Bloating of the whole Body, which was overladen as it were, or Water-&s;oaked. This mi&s;erable Object was extended on a Kind of Bed, of hot of very warm A&s;hes, quickly heated in great Kettles; and by laying her quite naked on the&s;e A&s;hes; by covering her with others equally hot; by putting a Bonnet round her Head, with a Stock|ing round her Neck &s;tuffed with the &s;ame, and heaping Cover|ings over all this, at the End of Half an Hour her Pul&s;e return|ed, &s;he recovered her Speech, and cried out, <HI>I freeze, I freeze</HI>: A little Cherry-Brandy was given her, and then &s;he remained bu|ried, as it were, eight Hours under the A&s;hes; being taken out of them afterwards without any other Complaint, except that of great La&s;&s;itude or Wearine&s;s, which went entirely off the third Day. This Method was undoubtedly &s;o effectual, that it well de&s;erves Imitation; but it &s;hould not make us inattentive to the others. Heated Gravel or Sand mixed with Salt, or hot Salt alone, would have been equally efficacious, and they have been found &s;o.</P>
<P>At the very Time of writing this, two young Ducks, that were drowned, have been revived by a dry Bath of hot A&s;hes. The Heat of a Dung-heap may al&s;o be beneficial; and I have ju&s;t been informed, by a very creditable and &s;en&s;ible Spectator of it, that it effectually contributed to re&s;tore Life to a Man, who had cer|tainly remained &s;ix Hours under Water.</P>
<P>&sect; 405. I &s;hall conclude the&s;e Directions with an Article printed in a little Work at <HI>Paris,</HI> about twenty Years &s;ince, by Order of the King, to which there is not the lea&s;t Doubt, but that any other Sovereign will readily accede.</P>
<P><Q>Notwith&s;tanding the common People are very generally di&s;|po&s;ed to be compa&s;&s;ionate, and may wi&s;h to give all A&s;&s;i&s;tance to drowned Per&s;ons, it frequently happens they do not, only becau&s;e they dare not; imagining they expo&s;e them&s;elves by it to Pro&s;ecutions. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould

know, and it cannot be too often repeated, in order to eradi|cate &s;uch a pernicious Prejudice, that the Magi&s;trates have ne|ver interpo&s;ed to prevent People from trying every po&s;&s;ible Means to recover &s;uch unfortunate Per&s;ons, as &s;hall be drowned and taken out of the Water. It is only in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, when the Per&s;ons are known to be ab&s;olutely and irrecoverably dead, that Ju&s;tice renders it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eize their Bodies.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIX. Of Sub&s;tances &s;topt between the Mouth and the Stomach.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 406. THE Food we take in de&s;cends from the Mouth through a very &s;trait Pa&s;&s;age or Channel called the <HI>Oe&s;ophagus,</HI> the Gul|let, which going parallel with the Spine or Backbone, joins to, or terminates at, the Stomach.</P>
<P>It happens &s;ometimes that different Bodies are &s;topt in this Channel, without being able either to de&s;cend or to return up again; whether this Difficulty ari&s;es from their being too large; or whether it be owing to their having &s;uch Angles or Points, as by penetrating into, and adhering to the Sides of this membranous Canal, ab&s;olutely prevent the u&s;ual Action and Motion of it.</P>
<P>&sect; 407. Very dangerous Symptoms ari&s;e from this Stoppage, which are frequently attended with a mo&s;t acute Pain in the Part; and at other times, with a very incommodious, rather than pain|ful, Sen&s;ation; &s;ometimes an ineffectual Commotion at, or ri&s;ing of, the Stomach, attended with great Angui&s;h; and if the Stop|page be &s;o circum&s;tanced, that the <HI>Glottis</HI> is clo&s;ed, or the Wind|pipe compre&s;&s;ed, a dreadful Suffocation is the Con&s;equence: the Patient cannot breathe, the Lungs are quite di&s;tended; and the Blood being unable to return from the Head, the Countenance becomes fir&s;t red, then livid; the Neck &s;wells; the Oppre&s;&s;ion in|crea&s;es, and the poor Sufferer &s;peedily dies&punc;</P>
<P>When the Patient's Breathing is not &s;topt, nor greatly oppre&s;&s;|ed; if the Pa&s;&s;age is not entirely blocked up, and he can &s;wal|low &s;omething, he lives very ea&s;ily for a few Days, and then his Ca&s;e becomes a particular Di&s;order of the <HI>Oe&s;ophagus,</HI> or Gullet, But if the Pa&s;&s;age is ab&s;olutely clo&s;ed, and the Ob&s;truction can|not be removed for many Days, a terrible Death is the Con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>&sect; 408. The Danger of &s;uch Ca&s;es does not depend &s;o much on the Nature of the ob&s;tructing Sub&s;tance, as on its Size, with re|gard to that of the Pa&s;&s;age of the Part where it &s;tops, and of the Manner in which it forms the Ob&s;truction; and frequently the
<PB N="210" REF="012243_0230_0F8A6D5224608FA0">
very Food may occa&s;ion Death; while Sub&s;tances le&s;s adapted to be &s;wallowed are not attended with any violent Con&s;equences, though &s;wallowed.</P>
<P>A Child of &s;ix Days old &s;wallowed a Comfit or Sugar Plumb, which &s;tuck in the Pa&s;&s;age, and in&s;tantly killed it.</P>
<P>A grown Per&s;on perceived that a Bit of Mutton had &s;topt in the Pa&s;&s;age; not to alarm any Body he aro&s;e from Table; a Mo|ment afterwards, on looking where he might be gone, he was found dead. Another was choaked by a Bit of Cake; a third by a Piece of a Skin of a Ham; and a fourth by an Egg, which he &s;wallowed whole in a Bravado.</P>
<P>A Child was killed by a Che&s;nut &s;wallowed whole. Another died &s;uddenly, choaked (which is always the Circum&s;tance, when they die in&s;tantly after &s;uch Accidents) by a Pear which he had to&s;&s;ed up, and catched in his Mouth. A Woman was choaked with another Pear. A Piece of a Sinew continued eight Days in the Pa&s;&s;age, &s;o that it prevented the Patient from getting down any Thing u&s;e; at the Expiration of that Time it fell into the Stomach, being loo&s;ened by its Putridity: the Patient notwith|&s;tanding died &s;oon after, being killed by the Inflammation, Gan|grene, and Weakne&s;s it had occa&s;ioned. Unhappily there occur but too many In&s;tances of this Sort, of which it is unnece&s;&s;ary to cite more.</P>
<P>&sect; 409. Whenever any Sub&s;tance is thus detained in the Gul|let, there are two Ways of removing it; that is either by extract|ing it, or pu&s;hing it down. The &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t certain Way is always to extract or draw it out, but this is not always the ea&s;ie&s;t: and as the Efforts made for this Purpo&s;e greatly fatigue the Pa|tient, and are &s;ometimes attended with grievous Con&s;equences; therefore, if the Occa&s;ion is extremely urging, it may be eligible to thru&s;t it down, if that is ea&s;ier; and if there is no Danger from the Reception of the ob&s;tructing Body into the Stomach.</P>
<P>The Sub&s;tances which may be pu&s;hed down without Danger are all common nouri&s;hing ones, as Bread, Meat, Cakes, Fruits, Puls, Mor&s;els of Tripe, and even Skin of Bacon. It is only very large Mor&s;els of particular Aliments, that prove very difficult to di|ge&s;t; yet even &s;uch are rarely attended with any Fatality.</P>
<P>&sect; 410 The Sub&s;tances we &s;hould endeavour to extract or draw out, though it be mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> painful and le&s;s ea&s;y than to pu&s;h them down, are all tho&s;e, who&s;e Con&s;equences might be highly dan|gerous, or even mortal, if &s;wallowed. Such are all totally indi|ge&s;tible Bodies, as Cork, Linen-Rags, large Fruit Stones, Bones, Wood, Gla&s;s, Stones, Metals; and more e&s;pecially if any further Danger may be &s;uperadded to that of its Indige&s;tibility, from the Shape, whether rough, &s;harp, pointed, or angular, of the Sub|&s;tance &s;wallowed. Wherefore we &s;hould chiefly endeavour to ex|tract Pins, Needles, Fi&s;h-bones, other pointed Fragments of Bones, Bits of Gla&s;s, Sci&s;&s;ars, Rings, or Buckles.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="012243_0231_0F8A6D524950B078">Neverthele&s;s it has happened, that every one of the&s;e Sub|&s;tances have at one Time or another been &s;wallowed, and the mo&s;t u&s;ual Con&s;equences of them are violent Pains of the Stomach, and in the Guts; Inflammations, Suppurations, Ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, a &s;low Fever, Gangrene, the <HI>Mi&s;erere</HI> or Iliac Pa&s;&s;ion; external Ab&s;ce&s;|&s;es, through which the Bodies &s;wallowed down have been di&s;|charged; and frequently, after a long Train of Maladies, a dread|ful Death.</P>
<P>&sect; 411. When &s;uch Sub&s;tances have not pa&s;&s;ed in too deep, we &s;hould endeavour to extract them with our Fingers, which often &s;ucceeds. If they are lower, we &s;hould make u&s;e of Nippers, or a &s;mall Forceps; of which Surgeons are provided with different Sorts. Tho&s;e which &s;ome Smoakers carry about them might be very convenient for &s;uch Purpo&s;es; and in Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity they might be made very readily out of two Bits of Wood. But this Attempt to extract rarely &s;ucceeds, if the Sub&s;tance has de&s;cended far into the <HI>Oe&s;ophagus,</HI> and if it be of a flexible Nature, which exactly applies it&s;elf to, and fills up the Cavity or Channel of the Gullet.</P>
<P>&sect; 412. If the Fingers and the Nippers fail, or cannot be duly applied, Crotchets, a Kind of Hooks, mu&s;t be employed.</P>
<P>Such may be made at once with a pretty &s;trong Iron Wire, crooked at the End. It mu&s;t be introduced in the flat Way, and for the better conducting of it, there &s;hould be another Curve or Hook at the End it is held by, to &s;erve as a Kind of Handle to it, which has this further U&s;e, that it may be &s;ecured by a String tied to it; a Circum&s;tance not to be omitted in any In&s;tru|ment employed on the like Occa&s;ions, to avoid &s;uch ill Accidents as have &s;ometimes en&s;ued, from the&s;e In&s;truments &s;lipping out of the Operator's Hold. After the Crotchet has pa&s;&s;ed beyond and below the Sub&s;tance, that ob&s;tructs the Pa&s;&s;age, it is drawn up again, and hooks up with it and extracts that Impediment to &s;wal|lowing.</P>
<P>This Crotchet is al&s;o very convenient, whenever a Sub&s;tance &s;omewhat flexible, as a Pin or a Fi&s;hbone &s;ticks, as it were, acro&s;s the Gullet: the Crotchet in &s;uch Ca&s;es &s;eizing them about their middle Part, crooks and thus di&s;engages them. If they are very brittle Sub&s;tances, it &s;erves to break them; and if any Fragments &s;till adhere within, &s;ome other Means mu&s;t be u&s;ed to extract them.</P>
<P>&sect; 413. When the ob&s;tructing Bodies are &s;mall, and only &s;top up Part of the Pa&s;&s;age; and which may either ea&s;ily elude the Hook, or &s;traiten it by their Re&s;i&s;tance, a Kind of Rings may be u&s;ed, and made either &s;olid or flexible.</P>
<P>The &s;olid ones are made of Iron Wire, or of a String of very fine Bra&s;s Wire. For this Purpo&s;e the Wire is bent into a Circle about the middle Part of its Length, the Sides of which Circle do not touch each other, but leave a Ring, or hollow Cavity, of about an Inch Diameter. Then the long unbent Sides of the Wire are brought near each other; the circular Part or Ring is
<PB N="212" REF="012243_0232_0F8A6D530E4B4188">
introduced into the Gullet, in order to be conducted about the ob|&s;tructing Body, and &s;o to extract it. Very flexible Rings may be made of Wool, Thread, Silk, or &s;mall Packthread, which may be waxed, for their greater Strength and Con&s;i&s;tence. Then they are to be tied fa&s;t to a Handle of Iron Wire, of Whalebone, or of any alexible Wood; after which the Ring is to be intro|duced to &s;urround the ob&s;tructing Sub&s;tance, and to draw it out.</P>
<P>Several of the&s;e Rings pa&s;&s;ed through one another are often made u&s;e of, the more certainly to lay hold of the ob&s;tructing Body, which may be involved by one, if another &s;hould mi&s;s it. This Sort of Rings has one Advantage, which is, that when the Sub&s;tance to be extracted is once laid hold of, it may then, by turning the Handle, be retained &s;o &s;trongly in the Ring thus twi&s;ted, as to be moved every Way; which mu&s;t be a con&s;idera|ble Advantage in many &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>&sect; 414. A fourth Material employed on the&s;e unhappy Occa|&s;ions is the Spunge. Its Property of &s;welling con&s;iderably, on being wet, is the Foundation of its U&s;efulne&s;s here.</P>
<P>If any Sub&s;tance is &s;topt in the Gullet, but without filling up the whole Pa&s;&s;age, a Bit of Spunge is introduced into that Part that is un&s;topt, and beyond the Sub&s;tance. The Spunge &s;oon dilates, and grows larger in this moi&s;t Situation, and indeed the Enlargement of it may be forwarded, by making the Patient &s;wallow a few Drops of Water; and then drawing back the Spunge by the Handle it is fa&s;tened to, as it is now too large to return through the &s;mall Cavity, by which it was conveyed in, it draws out the ob&s;tructing Body with it, and thus unplugs, as it were, and opens the Gullet.</P>
<P>As dry Spunge may &s;hrink or be contracted, this Circum&s;tance has proved the Means of &s;queezing a pretty large Piece of it into a very &s;mall Space. It becomes greatly compre&s;&s;ed by winding a String or Tape very clo&s;ely about it, which Tape may be ea&s;ily unwound and withdrawn, after the Spunge has been introduced. It may al&s;o be inclo&s;ed in a Piece of Whalebone, &s;plit into four Sticks at one End, and which, being endued with a con&s;idera|ble Spring, contracts upon the Spunge. The Whalebone is &s;o &s;moothed and accommodated, as not to wound; and the Spunge is al&s;o to be &s;afely tied to a &s;trong Thread; that after having di&s;|engaged the Whalebone from it, the Surgeon may al&s;o draw out the Spunge at Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Spunge is al&s;o applied on the&s;e Occa&s;ions in another Manner. When there is no Room to convey it into the Gullet, becau&s;e the ob&s;tructing Sub&s;tance ingro&s;&s;es its whole Cavity; and &s;uppo&s;ing it not hooked into the Part, but &s;olely detained by the Straitne&s;s of the Pa&s;&s;age, a pretty large Bit of Spunge is to be introduced to|wards the Gullet, and clo&s;e to the ob&s;tructing Sub&s;tance: Thus applied, the Spunge &s;wells, and thence dilates that Part of the Pa&s;&s;age that is above this Sub&s;tance. The Spunge is then with
<PB N="213" REF="012243_0233_0F8A6D53D3FD5328">
drawn a little, and but a very little, and this Sub&s;tance being le&s; pre&s;&s;ed upon above than below, it &s;ometimes happens, that the greater Straitne&s;s and Contraction of the lower Part of the Pa&s;|&s;age, than of its upper Part, cau&s;es that Sub&s;tance to a&s;cend; and as &s;oon as this fir&s;t Loo&s;ening or Di&s;engagement of it has hap|pened, the total Di&s;engagement of it ea&s;ily follows.</P>
<P>&sect; 415. Finally, when all the&s;e Methods prove unavailable, there remains one more, which is to make the Patient vomit; but this can &s;carcely be of any Service, but when &s;uch ob&s;tructing Bodies are &s;imply engaged in, and not hooked or &s;truck into the Sides of the <HI>Oe&s;ophagus</HI>; &s;ince under this latter Circum&s;tance vo|miting might occa&s;ion further Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>If the Patient can &s;wallow, a Vomiting may be excited with the Pre&s;cription No. 8 or with No. 34, or 35. By this Opera|tion a Bone was thrown out, which had &s;topt in the Pa&s;&s;age four and twenty Hours.</P>
<P>When the Patient cannot &s;wallow, an Attempt &s;hould be made to excite him to vomit by introducing into, and twirling about the feathery End of a Quill in, the Bottom of the Throat, which the Feather however will not effect, if the ob&s;tructing Body &s;trongly compre&s;&s;es the whole Circumference of the Gullet; and then no other Re&s;ource is left, but giving a Gly&s;ter of Tobacco. A certain Per&s;on &s;wallowed a large Mor&s;el of Calf's Light&s;, which &s;topt in the Middle of the Gullet, and exactly filled up the Pa&s;&s;age. A Surgeon un&s;ucce&s;sfully attempted various Methods to extract it; but another &s;eeing how unavailable all of them were; and the Patient's Vi&s;age becoming black and &s;welled; his Eyes ready to &s;tart, as it were, out of his Head; and falling in|to frequent Swoonings, attended with Convul&s;ions too, he cau&s;ed a Gly&s;ter of an Ounce of Tobacco boiled to be thrown up; the Con&s;equence of which was a violent Vomiting, which threw up the Sub&s;tance that was &s;o very near killing him.</P>
<P>&sect; 416. A &s;ixth Method, which I believe has never hitherto been attempted, but which may prove very u&s;eful in many Ca&s;es, when the Sub&s;tances in the Pa&s;&s;age are not too hard, and are very large, would be to fix a Worm (u&s;ed for withdrawing the Charge of Guns that have been loaded) fa&s;t to a flexible Handle, with a waxed Thread fa&s;tened to the Handle, in order to with|draw it, if the Handle &s;lipt from the Worm; and by this Con|trivance it might be very practicable, if the ob&s;tructing Sub&s;tance was not too deep in the Pa&s;&s;age of the Gullet, to extract it.&mdash; It has been known that a Thorn fa&s;tened in the Throat, has been thrown out by laughing.</P>
<P>&sect; 417. In the Circum&s;tances mentioned &sect; 409, when it is more ea&s;y and convenient to pu&s;h the ob&s;tructing Body downwards, it has been u&s;ual to make u&s;e of Leeks, which may generally be had any where (but which indeed are very &s;ubject to break) or of a Wax-candle oiled, and but a very little heated, &s;o as to make it flexible; or of a Piece of Whalebone; or of Iron-Wire; one
<PB N="214" REF="012243_0234_0F8A6D5488851F30">
Extremity of which may be thickened and blunted in a Minute with a little melted Lead. Small Sticks of &s;ome flexible Wood may be as convenient for the &s;ame U&s;e, &s;uch as the Birch-tree, the Hazel, the A&s;h, the Willow, a flexible Plummet, or a leaden Ring. All the&s;e Sub&s;tances &s;hould be very &s;mooth, that they may not give the lea&s;t Irritation; for which Rea&s;on they are &s;ometimes covered over with a thin Bit of Sheep's Gut. Some|times a Spunge is fa&s;tened to one End of them, which, completely filling up the whole Pa&s;&s;age, pu&s;hes down whatever Ob&s;tacle it meets with.</P>
<P>In &s;uch Ca&s;es too, the Patient may be prompted to attempt &s;wallowing down large Mor&s;els of &s;ome unhurtful Sub&s;tance, &s;uch as a Cru&s;t of Bread, a &s;mall Turnep, a Lettuce Stalk, or a Bullet, in Hopes of their carrying down the ob&s;tructing Cau&s;e with them. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, however, that the&s;e afford but a feeble A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and if they are &s;wallowed without being well &s;ecured to a Thread, it may be apprehended they may even increa&s;e the Ob&s;truction, by their own Stoppage.</P>
<P>It has &s;ometimes very happily, though rarely, occured, that tho&s;e Sub&s;tances attempted to be detruded or thru&s;t downwards, have &s;tuck in the Wax-Candle, or the Leek, and &s;prung up and out with them: but this can never happen, except in the Ca&s;e of pointed Sub&s;tances.</P>
<P>&sect; 418. Should it be impo&s;&s;ible to extract the Bodies mentioned &sect; 410, and all &s;uch as it mu&s;t be dangerous to admit into the Sto|mach, we mu&s;t then prefer the lea&s;t of two Evils, and rather run the Hazard of pu&s;hing them down, than &s;uffer the Patient to pe|ri&s;h dreadfully in a few Moments. And we ought to &s;cruple this Re&s;olution the le&s;s, as a great many In&s;tances have demon&s;trated, that notwith&s;tanding &s;everal bad Con&s;equences, and even a tor|menting Death, have often followed the &s;wallowing of &s;uch hurt|ful or indige&s;tible Sub&s;tances; yet at other times they have been attended with little or no Di&s;order.</P>
<P>&sect; 419. One of the&s;e four Events is always the Ca&s;e, after &s;wallowing &s;uch Things. They either, 1, go off by Stool; or, 2, they are not di&s;charged, and kill the Patient. Or el&s;e, 3, they are di&s;charged by Urine; or, 4, are vi&s;ibly extruded to the Skin. I &s;hall give &s;ome In&s;tances of each of the&s;e Events.</P>
<P>&sect; 420. When they are voided by Stool, they are either voided &s;oon after they have been &s;wallowed, and that without having oc|ca&s;ioned &s;carce any trouble&s;ome Symptoms; or the voiding of them has not happened till a long time after &s;wallowing, and is preceded with very con&s;iderable Pain. It has been &s;een that a Bone of the Leg of a Fowl, a Peach-&s;tone, the Cover of a &s;mall Box of Venice Treacle, Pins, Needles, and Coins of different Sorts, have been voided within a few Days after they had &s;lipt down into the Stomach; and that with little or no Complaint. A &s;mall Flute, or Pipe al&s;o, four Inches long, which occa&s;ioned acute Pains for three Days, has been voided happily afterwards,
<PB N="215" REF="012243_0235_0F8A6D5548075410">
be&s;ides Knives, Razors, and one Shoe-buckle. I have &s;een but a few Days &s;ince, a Child between two and three Years old, who &s;wallowed a Nail above an Inch long, the Head of which was more than three Tenths of an Inch broad: it &s;topt a few Moments about the Neck, but de&s;cended while its Friends were looking for me; and was voided with a Stool that Night, without any bad Con&s;equence. And &s;till more lately I have known the entire Bone of a Chicken's Wing thus &s;wallowed, which only occa&s;ioned a &s;light Pain in the Stomach for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rce or four Days.</P>
<P>Sometimes &s;uch Sub&s;tances are retained within for a long Time, not being voided till after &s;everal Months, and even Years, with|out the lea&s;t ill Effect: and &s;ome of them have never either ap|peared, nor been complained of.</P>
<P>&sect; 421. But the Event is not always &s;o happy; and &s;ometimes, though they are di&s;charged through the natural Pa&s;&s;ages, the Di&s;|charges have been preceded by very acute Pains in the Stomach, and in the Bowels. A Girl &s;wallowed down &s;ome Pins, which af|flicted her with violent Pains for the Space of Six Years; at the Expriation of which Term &s;he voided them and recovered. Three Needles being &s;wallowed brought on Cholics, Swoonings and Con|vul&s;ions for a Year after: and then being voided by Stool, the Patient recovered. Another Per&s;on who &s;wallowed two, was much happier, in &s;uffering but &s;ix Hours from them; when they were voided by Stool, and he did well.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens that &s;uch indige&s;tible Sub&s;tances, after having pa&s;t all the Meanders, the whole Cour&s;e of the Inte&s;tines, have been &s;topt in the Fundament, and brought on very trouble|&s;ome Symptoms; but &s;uch however, as an expert Surgeon may very generally remove. If it is practicable to cut them, as it is when they happen to be thin Bones, the Jaw-bones of Fi&s;h, or Pins, they are then very ea&s;ily extracted.</P>
<P>&sect; 422. The &s;econd Event is when the&s;e fatal Sub&s;tances are never voided, but cau&s;e very embarra&s;&s;ing Symptoms which finally kill the Patient; and of the&s;e Ca&s;es there have been but too many Examples.</P>

The whole Carca&s;e was greatly bloated and extremely offen&s;ive, very &s;oon after the poor Animal's Death, which hap|pened two or three Months after the Accident, and was preceded by a great Wheezing, Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and Lo&s;s of Appetite.

<P>&sect; 426. It has been &s;hewn already, that Sub&s;tances ob&s;tructing the Pa&s;&s;age of the Gullet &s;ometimes &s;uffocate the Patient; that at other times they can neither be extracted nor thru&s;t down; but that they &s;top in the Pa&s;&s;age, without killing the Patient, at lea&s;t not immediately and at once. This is the Ca&s;e when they are &s;o circum&s;tanced, as not to compre&s;s the <HI>Trach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a,</HI> the Wind-pipe, and not totally to prevent the &s;wallowing of Food; which la&s;t Circum&s;tance can &s;carcely happen, except the Ob&s;truction has been formed by angular or pointed Bodies. The Stoppage of &s;uch Bo|dies is &s;ometimes attended, and that without much Violence, with a &s;mall Suppuration, which loo&s;ens them; and then they are ei|ther returned upwards through the Mouth, or de&s;cend into the Stomach. But at other times an extraordinary Inflammation is produced, which kills the Patient. Or if the Contents of the Ab&s;ce&s;s attending the Inflammation tend outwardly, a Tumour is formed on the external Part of the Neck which is to be opened, and through who&s;e Orifice the ob&s;tructing Body is di&s;charged. In other In&s;tances again they take a different Cour&s;e, attended with little or no Pain, and are at length di&s;charged by a Gathering be|hind the Neck, on the Brea&s;t, the Shoulder, or various other Parts.</P>
<P>&sect; 427. Some Per&s;ons, a&s;toni&s;hed at the extraordinary Cour&s;e and Progre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Sub&s;tances, which, from their Size, and e&s;pecially from their Shape, &s;eem to them incapable of being in|troduced into, and in &s;ome Sort, circulating through the human Body, without de&s;troying it, are very de&s;irous of having the Rout and Progre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch intruding Sub&s;tances explained to them. To gratify &s;uch Inquirers, I may be indulged in a &s;hort Digre&s;&s;ion, which perhaps is the le&s;s foreign to my Plan; as in di&s;&s;ipating what &s;eems marvelous, and has been thought &s;uper|natural in &s;uch Ca&s;es, I may eradicate that &s;uper&s;titious Preju|dice, which has often a&s;cribed Effects of this Sort to Witchcraft; but which admit of an ea&s;y Explanation. This very Rea&s;on is the Motive that has determined me to give a further Extent to this Chapter.</P>
<P>Wherever an Inci&s;ion is made through the Skin, a certain Mem|brane appears, which con&s;i&s;ts of two Coats or <HI>Lamin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> &s;eparated from each other by &s;mall Cells or Cavities, which all communi|cate
<PB N="218" REF="012243_0238_0F8A6D58E112DBA0">
together; and which are furni&s;hed, more or le&s;s, with Fat, There is not any Fat throughout the human Body, which is not inclo&s;ed in, or enveloped with, this Coat, which is called the a|dipo&s;e, fatty, or cellular Membrane.</P>
<P>This Membrane is not only found under the Skin, but further plying and in&s;inuating it&s;elf in various Manners, it is extended throughout the whole Body. It di&s;tingui&s;hes and &s;eparates all the Mu&s;cles; it con&s;titutes a Part of the Stomach, of the Guts, of the Bladder, and of all the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> or Bowels. It is this which forms what is termed the Cawl, and which al&s;o furni&s;hes a Sheath or Envelopement to the Veins, Arteries, and Nerves. In &s;ome Parts it is very thick, and is abundantly repleni&s;hed with Fat; in others it is very thin and unprovided with any; but wherever it extends, it is wholly in&s;en&s;ible, or void of all Sen&s;ation, all Feeling.</P>
<P>It may be compared to a quilted Coverlet, the Cotton, or other Stuffing of which, is unequally di&s;tributed; greatly abounding in &s;ome Places, with none at all in others, &s;o that in the&s;e the Stuff above and below, touch each other. Within this Membrane, or Coverlet, as it were, &s;uch extraneous or foreign Sub&s;tances are moved about; and as there is a general Communication through|out the whole Extent of the Membrane, it is no ways &s;urprizing, that they are moved from one Part to another very di&s;tant, in a long Cour&s;e and Duration of Movement. Officers and Soldiers very often experience, that Bullets which do not pa&s;s through the Parts where they have entered, are transferred to very dif|ferent and remote ones.</P>
<P>The general Communication throughout this Membrane is dai|ly demon&s;trated by Facts, which the Law prohibits; this is the Butchers inflating, or blowing up, the cellular Membrane thro'|out the whole Carca&s;e of a Calf, by a &s;mall Inci&s;ion in the Skin, into which they introduce a Pipe or the Nozzle of a &s;mall Bellows; and then, on blowing forcibly, the Air evidently puffs up the whole Body of the Calf into this artificial Tumour or Swelling.</P>
<P>Some very criminal Impo&s;tors have availed them&s;elves of this wicked Contrivance, thus to bloat up Children into a Kind of Mon&s;ters, which they afterwards expo&s;e to View for Money.</P>
<P>In this cellular Membrane the extrava&s;ated Waters of hydropic Patients are commonly diffu&s;ed; and here they give Way to that Motion, to which their own Weight di&s;po&s;es them. But here I may be a&s;ked&mdash;As this Membrane is cro&s;&s;ed and inter&s;ected in dif|ferent Parts of it, by Nerves, Veins, Arteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the wound|ing of which unavoidably occa&s;ions grievous Symptoms, how comes it, that &s;uch do not en&s;ue upon the Intru&s;ion of &s;uch nox|ious Sub&s;tances? To this I an&s;wer, 1, that &s;uch Symptoms do &s;ometimes really en&s;ue; and, 2, that neverthele&s;s they mu&s;t hap|pen but &s;eldom, by Rea&s;on that all the afore&s;aid Parts, which traver&s;e and inter&s;ect this Membrane, being harder than the Fat it contains; &s;uch foreign Sub&s;tances mu&s;t almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, when|ever

ever they rencounter tho&s;e Parts, be turned a&s;ide towards the Fat which &s;urrounds them, who&s;e Re&s;i&s;tance is very con&s;idera|bly le&s;s; and this he more certainly &s;o, as the&s;e Nerves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are always of a cylindrical Form. &mdash; But to return from this ne|ce&s;&s;ary Digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; 428. To all the&s;e Methods and Expedients, which I have al|ready recommended on the important Subject of this Chapter, I &s;hall further add &s;ome general Directions.</P>
<P>1. It is often u&s;eful, and even nece&s;&s;ary, to take a con&s;iderable Quantity of Blood from the Arm; but e&s;pecially if the Patient's Re&s;piration, or Breathing, is extremely oppre&s;&s;ed; or when we cannot &s;peedily &s;ucceed in our Effort to remove the ob&s;tructing Sub&s;tance; as the Bleeding is adapted to prevent the Inflamma|tion, which the frequent Irritations from &s;uch Sub&s;tances occa|&s;ion; and as by its di&s;po&s;ing the whole Body into a State of Re|laxation, it might po&s;&s;ibly procure an immediate Di&s;charge of the offending Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>2. Whenever it is manife&s;t that all Endeavours, either to ex|tract, or to pu&s;h down the Sub&s;tance &s;topped in the Pa&s;&s;age, are ineffectual, they &s;hould be di&s;continued; becau&s;e the Inflamma|tion occa&s;ioned by per&s;i&s;ting in them, would be as dangerous as the Ob&s;truction it&s;elf; as there have been In&s;tances of People's dying in Con&s;equence of the Inflammation; notwith&s;tanding the Body, which cau&s;ed the Ob&s;truction, had been entirely removed.</P>
<P>3. While the Means already advi&s;ed are making u&s;e of, the Patient &s;hould often &s;wallow, or, if he cannot, he &s;hould fre|quently receive by Injection through a crooked Tube or Pipe, that may reach lower down than the <HI>Glottis,</HI> &s;ome very emollient Li|quor, as warm Water, either alone or mixed with Milk, or a De|coction of Barley, of Mallows, or of Bran. A two-fold Advan|tage may ari&s;e from this; the fir&s;t is, that the&s;e &s;oftening Liquors &s;mooth and &s;ooth the irritated Parts; and &s;econdly, an Injec|tion, &s;trongly thrown in, has often been more &s;ucce&s;sful in loo&s;|ening the ob&s;tructing Body, than all Attempts with In&s;truments.</P>
<P>4. When after all we are obliged to leave this in the Part, the Patient mu&s;t be treated as if he had an inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;e; he mu&s;t be bled, ordered to a Regimen, and have his whole Neck &s;urrounded with emollient Pultices. The like Treatment mu&s;t al&s;o be u&s;ed, though the ob&s;tructing Sub&s;tance be removed; if there is Room to &s;uppo&s;e any Inflammation left in the Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>5. A proper Degree of Agitation has &s;ometimes loo&s;ened the inhering Body, more effectually than In&s;truments. It has been experienced that a Blow with the Fi&s;t on the Spine, the Middle of the Back, has often di&s;engaged &s;uch ob&s;tructed and ob&s;truct|ing Bodies; and I have known two In&s;tances of Patients who had Pins &s;topt in the Pa&s;&s;age; and who getting on Hor&s;eback to ride out in Search of Relief at a neighbouring Village, found each of them the Pin di&s;engaged after an Hour's Riding: One &s;pat it out, and the other &s;wallowed it, without any ill Con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="012243_0240_0F8A6D5B6904F230">6. When there is an immediate Apprehen&s;ion of the Patient's being &s;uffocated; when bleeding him has been of no Service; when all Hope of freeing the Pa&s;&s;age in time is vani&s;hed, and Death &s;eems at Hand, if Re&s;piration be not re&s;tored; the Operation of <HI>Bronchotomy,</HI> or opening of the Wind-pipe, mu&s;t be directly per|formed; an Operation neither difficult to a tolerably knowing and expert Surgeon, nor very painful to the Patient.</P>
<P>7. When the Sub&s;tance that was &s;topt pa&s;&s;es into the Stomach, the Patient mu&s;t immediately be put into a very mild and &s;mooth Regimen. He &s;hould avoid all &s;harp, irritating, inflaming Food; Wine, &s;pirituous Liquors, all &s;trong Drink, and Coffee; taking but little Nouri&s;hment at once, and no Solids, without their hav|ing been thoroughly well chewed. The be&s;t Diet would be that of farinaceous mealy Soups, made of various leguminous Grains, and of Milk and Water, which is much better than the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom of &s;wallowing different Oils.</P>
<P>&sect; 429. The Author of Nature has provided, that in eating, nothing &s;hould pa&s;s by the <HI>Glottis</HI> into the Wind-pipe. This Mi&s;|fortune neverthele&s;s does &s;ometimes happen; at which very In|&s;tant there en&s;ues an ince&s;&s;ant and violent Cough, an acute Pain, with Suffocation; all the Blood being forced up into the Head, the Patient is in extreme Angui&s;h, being agitated with violent and involuntary Motions, and &s;ometimes dying on the Spot. A <HI>Hun|garian</HI> Grenadier, by Trade a Shoe-maker, was eating and working at the &s;ame time. He tumbled at once from his Seat, without ut|tering a &s;ingle Word. His Comrades called out for A&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;ome Surgeons &s;peedily arrived, but after all their Endeavours he di&s;covered no Token of Life. On opening the Body, they found a Lump, or large Mor&s;el, of Beef, weighing two Ounces, forced into the Wind-pipe, which it plugged up &s;o exactly, that not the lea&s;t Air could pa&s;s through it into the Lungs.</P>
<P>&sect; 430. In a Ca&s;e &s;o circum&s;tanced, the Patient &s;hould be &s;truck often on the Middle of the Back; &s;ome Efforts to vomit &s;hould be excited; he &s;hould be prompted to &s;neeze with Powder of Lil|ly of the Valley, Sage, or any cephalic Snuffs, which &s;hould be blown &s;trongly up his No&s;e.</P>
<P>A Pea, pitched into the Mouth in playing, entered into the Wind-pipe, and &s;prung out again by vomiting the Patient with Oil. A little Bone was brought up from another, by making him &s;neeze, with powdered Lilly of the Valley.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, if all the&s;e Means of a&s;&s;i&s;ting, or &s;aving the Patient are evidently ineffectual, <HI>Bronchotomy</HI> mu&s;t be &s;peedily performed (See No. 6, of the preceding Section.) By this Operation, &s;ome Bones, a Bean, and a Fi&s;h-bone have been extracted, and the Patient has been delivered from approaching Death.</P>
<P>&sect; 431. Nothing &s;hould be left untried, when the Pre&s;ervation of human Life is the Object. In tho&s;e Ca&s;es, when an ob&s;truct|ing Body can neither be di&s;engaged from the Throat, the Pa&s;|&s;age to the Stomach, nor be &s;uffered to remain there without
<PB N="221" REF="012243_0241_0F8A6D5C41B3B6F8">
&s;peedly killing the Patient, it has been propo&s;ed to make an In|ci&s;ion into this Pa&s;&s;age, the <HI>Oe&s;ophagus,</HI> through which &s;uch a Bo|dy is to be extracted; and to employ the like Means, when a Sub&s;tance which had &s;lipt even into the Stomach it&s;elf, was of a Nature to excite &s;uch Symptoms, as mu&s;t &s;peedily de&s;troy the Patient.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Oe&s;ophagus</HI> is &s;o fully and &s;trongly clo&s;ed, that the Patient can receive no Food by the Mouth, he is to be nouri&s;hed by Gly&s;ters of Soup, Gelly, and the like.</P>

Neverthele&s;s, the very improper Treatment of &s;uch Accidents, in the Country, frequently renders them, however light in them&s;elves, very trouble&s;ome; and indeed, I have &s;een &s;o many In&s;tances of this, that I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to mark out here the proper Treatment of &s;uch Accidents, as may not nece&s;&s;arily require the Hand or Attendance of a Surgeon. I &s;hall al&s;o add &s;omething very briefly, concerning &s;ome external Di&s;orders, which at the &s;ame time re&s;ult from an inward Cau&s;e.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Burns.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 433. When a Burn is very trifling and &s;uperficial, and occa|&s;ions no Ve&s;ication or Bli&s;ter, it is &s;ufficient to clap a Compre&s;s of &s;everal Folds of &s;oft Linen upon it, dipt in cold Water, and to renew it every Quarter of an Hour, till the Pain is entirely re|moved.
<PB N="222" REF="012243_0242_0F8A6D5DE6B01168">
But when the Burn has bli&s;tered, a Compre&s;s of very fine Linen, &s;pread over with the Pomatum, No. 64, &s;hould be applied over it, and changed twice a Day.</P>
<P>If the true Skin is burnt, and even the Mu&s;cles, the Fle&s;h un|der it, be injured, the &s;ame Pomatum may be applied; but in|&s;tead of a Compre&s;s&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould be &s;pread upon a Pledget of &s;oft Lint, to be applied very exactly over it, and over the Pledget a|gain, a Slip of the &s;imple Plai&s;ter No. 65. which every Body may ea&s;ily prepare; or, if they &s;hould prefer it, the Plai&s;ter No. 66.</P>
<P>But, independently of the&s;e external Applications, which are the mo&s;t effectual ones, when they are directly to be had; whene|ver the Burn has been very violent, is highly inflamed, and we are apprehen&s;ive of the Progre&s;s and the Con&s;equences of the In|flammation, the &s;ame Means and Remedies mu&s;t be recurred to, which are u&s;ed in violent Inflammations: the Patient &s;hould be bled, and, if it is nece&s;&s;ary, it &s;hould be repeated more than once, and he &s;hould be put into a Regimen; drink nothing but the Pti&s;ans No. 2 and 4, and receive daily two &s;imple Gly&s;ters.</P>
<P>If the Ingredients for the Ointment, called <HI>Nutritum,</HI> are not at Hand to make the Pomatum No. 64; one Part of Wax <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ould be melted in eight &s;uch Parts of Oil, to two Ounces of which Mixture the Yolk of an Egg &s;hould be added An Application &s;till more &s;imple and &s;ooner prepared, is that of one Egg (both the Yolk and the White) beat up with two common Spoonfuls of the &s;weete&s;t Oil, without any Rankne&s;s. When the Pain of the Burn, and all its other Symptoms have very nearly di&s;appeared, it is &s;ufficient to apply the Sparadrap, or Oilcloth No. 66.</P>

<HEAD>Of Wounds.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 434. If a Wound has penetrated into any of the Cavities, and has wounded any Part contained in the Brea&s;t, or in the Belly: Or if, without having entered into one of the Cavities, it has o|pened &s;ome great Blood-ve&s;&s;el; or if it has wounded a con&s;idera|ble Nerve, which occa&s;ions Symptoms much more violent, than would otherwi&s;e have happened; if it has penetrated even to and injured the Bone: it &s;hort, if any great and &s;evere Symptom &s;u|pervenes, there is an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity for calling in a Surgeon. But whenever the Wound is not attended with any of the&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances; when it affects only the Skin, the fat Membrane be|neath it, the fle&s;hy Parts and the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, it may ea&s;ily and &s;imply be dre&s;&s;ed without &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;ince, in general all that is truly nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch Ca&s;es is, to defend the Wound from the Impre&s;&s;ions of the Air; and yet not &s;o, as to give any material Ob&s;truction to the Di&s;charge of the Matter, that is to i&s;&s;ue from the Wound.</P>
<P>&sect; 435. If the Blood does not particularly flow out of any con|&s;iderable Ve&s;&s;el, but trickles almo&s;t equally from every Spot of the

Wound, it may very &s;afely be permitted to bleed, while &s;ome Lint is &s;peedily preparing. As &s;oon as the Lint is ready, &s;o much of it may be introduced into the Wound as will nearly fill it, with|out being forced in; which is highly improper, and would be attended with the &s;ame Inconveniences as Tents and Do&s;&s;ils. It &s;hould be covered over with a Compre&s;s dipt in &s;weet Oil, or with the Cerecloth No. 65; though I prefer the Compre&s;s for the ear|lie&s;t Dre&s;&s;ings: and the whole Dre&s;&s;ing &s;hould be kept on, with a &s;tandage of two Fingers Breadth, and of a Length proportioned to the Size of the Part it is to &s;urround: It &s;hould be rolled on tight enough to &s;ecure the Dre&s;&s;ings, and yet &s;o moderately, as to bring on no Inflammation.</P>
<P>This Bandage with the&s;e Dre&s;&s;ings are to remain on twenty-four or forty-eight Hours; Wounds being healed the &s;ooner, for be|ing le&s;s frequently dre&s;t. At the &s;econd Dre&s;&s;ing all the Lint mu&s;t be removed, which can be done with Ea&s;e, and with rea&s;onable Speed, to the Wounded; and if any of it &s;hould &s;tick clo&s;e, in Con&s;equence of the clogged and dried Blood, it &s;hould be left be|hind, adding a little fre&s;h Lint to it; this Dre&s;&s;ing in other Re|&s;pects exactly re&s;embling the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>When from the Continuance of this &s;imple Dre&s;&s;ing, the Wound is become very &s;uperficial, it is &s;ufficient to apply the Cerecloth, or Plai&s;ter, without any Lint.</P>
<P>Such as have conceived an extraordinary Opinion of any medi|cal Oils, impregnated with the Virtues of particular Plants, may, if that will increa&s;e their Satisfaction, make U&s;e of the common Oil of Yarrow, of Trefoil, of Lillies, of Chamomile, of Bal&s;a|mines, or of red Ro&s;es; only being very careful, that &s;uch Oils are not become &s;tale and rank.</P>
<P>&sect; 436. When the Wound is con&s;iderable, it mu&s;t be expected to inflame before Suppuration (which, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, advances more &s;lowly) can en&s;ue; which Inflammation will nece&s;&s;arily be attended with Pain, with a Fever, and &s;ometimes with a Raving, or Wandering, too. In &s;uch a Situation, a Pultice of Bread and Milk, with the Addition of a little Oil, that it may not &s;tick too clo&s;e, mu&s;t be applied in&s;tead of the Compre&s;s or the Plai&s;ter: which Pultice is to be changed, but without uncovering the Wound, thrice and even four times every Day.</P>
<P>&sect; 437. Should &s;ome pretty con&s;iderable Blood-ve&s;&s;el be opened by the Wound, there mu&s;t be applied over it a Piece of Agaric of the Oak, No. 67, of which no Country Place ought to be unpro|vided. It is to be kept on, by applying a good deal of Lint over it; covering the whole with a thick Compre&s;s, and then with a Bandage a little tighter than u&s;ual. If this &s;hould not be &s;uffi|cient to prevent the Bleeding from the large Ve&s;&s;el, and the Wound be in the Leg or Arm, a &s;trong Ligature mu&s;t be made a|bove the Wound with a <HI>Turniquet,</HI> which is formed in a Moment with a Skain of Thread, or of Hemp, that is pa&s;&s;ed round the Arm circularly, into the Middle of which is in&s;erted a Piece of
<PB N="224" REF="012243_0244_0F8A6D5F0A041E10">
Wood or Stick of an Inch Thickne&s;s, and four or five Inches long; &s;o that by turning round this Piece of Wood, any Tight|ne&s;s or Compre&s;&s;ion may be effected at Plea&s;ure; exactly as a Country-man &s;ecures a Hog&s;head, or a Piece of Timber on his Cart, with a Chain and Ring. But Care mu&s;t be taken, 1, to di&s;po&s;e the Skain in &s;uch a Manner, that it mu&s;t always be two Inches wider than the Part it &s;urrounds: and, 2, not to &s;train it &s;o tight as to bring on an Inflammation, which might termi|nate in a Gangrene.</P>
<P>&sect; 438. All the boa&s;ted Virtues of a Multitude of Ointments are downright Non&s;en&s;e or Quackery. Art, &s;trictly con&s;idered, does not in the lea&s;t contribute to the healing of Wounds; the utmo&s;t we can do amounting only to our removing tho&s;e Accidents, which are &s;o many Ob&s;tacles to their Re-union. On this Account, if there is any extraneous Body in the Wound, &s;uch as Iron, Lead, Wood, Gla&s;s, Bits of Cloth or Linen, they mu&s;t be extracted, if that can be very ea&s;ily done; but, if not, Application mu&s;t be made to a good Surgeon, who con&s;iders what Mea&s;ures are to be taken, and then dre&s;&s;es the Wound, as I have already advi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Very far from being u&s;eful, there are many Ointments that are pernicious on the&s;e Occa&s;ions; and the only Ca&s;es in which they &s;hould be u&s;ed, are tho&s;e in which the Wounds are di&s;tingui&s;hed with &s;ome particular Appearances, which ought to be removed by particular Applications: But a &s;imple recent Wound, in a healthy Man, requires no other Treatment but what I have al|ready directed, be&s;ides that of the general Regimen.</P>
<P>Spirituous Applications are commonly hurtful, and can be &s;uitable and proper but in a few Ca&s;es, which Phy&s;icians and Surgeons only can di&s;tingui&s;h.</P>
<P>When Wounds happen in the Head, in&s;tead of the Compre&s;s dipt in Oil, or of the Cerecloth, the Wound &s;hould be covered with a Betony Plai&s;ter; or, when none is to be had in time, with a Compre&s;s &s;queezed out of hot Wine.</P>
<P>&sect; 439. As the following Symptoms, of which we &s;hould be mo&s;t apprehen&s;ive, are &s;uch as attend Inflammations, the Means we ought to have Recour&s;e to are tho&s;e which are mo&s;t likely to pre|vent them; &s;uch as Bleeding, the u&s;ual Regimen, moderate Coolers and Gly&s;ters.</P>
<P>Should the Wound be very incon&s;iderable in its Degree, and in its Situation, it may be &s;ufficient to avoid taking any thing heating; and above all things to retrench the U&s;e of any &s;trong Drink, and of Fle&s;h-meat.</P>
<P>But when it is con&s;iderable, and an Inflammation mu&s;t be ex|pected, there is a Nece&s;&s;ity for Bleeding; the Patient &s;hould be kept in the mo&s;t quiet and ea&s;y Situation; he &s;hould be ordered immediately to a Regimen; and &s;ometimes the Bleeding al&s;o mu&s;t be repeated. Now all the&s;e Means are the more indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, when the Wound has penetrated to &s;ome internal Part; in which Situation, no Remedy is more certain than that of an

extremely light Diet. Such wounded Per&s;ons as have been &s;up|po&s;ed incapable of living many Hours, after Wounds in the Brea&s;t, in the Belly, or in the Kidneys, have been completely re|covered, by living for the Cour&s;e of &s;everal Weeks, on nothing but Barley, or other farinaceous, mealy Pti&s;ans, without Salt, without Soup, without any Medicine; and e&s;pecially without the U&s;e of any Ointments.</P>
<P>&sect; 440. In the &s;ame Proportion that Bleeding, moderately and judiciou&s;ly employed, is &s;erviceable, in that very &s;ame an Exce&s;s of it becomes pernicious. Great Wounds are generally attended with a con&s;iderable Lo&s;s of Blood, which has already exhau&s;ted the wounded Per&s;on; and the Fever is often a Con&s;equence of this copious Lo&s;s of Blood. Now if under &s;uch a Circum&s;tance, Bleeding &s;hould be ordered and performed, the Patient's Strength is totally &s;unk; the Humours &s;tagnate and corrupt; a Gangrene &s;upervenes, and he dies mi&s;erably, at the End of two or three Days, of a <HI>Series</HI> of repeated Bleedings, but not of the Wound. Notwith&s;tanding the Certainty of this, the Surgeon frequently boa&s;ts of his ten, twelve, or even his fifteen Bleedings; a&s;&s;ur|ing his Hearers of the in&s;uperable Mortality of the Wound, &s;ince the letting out &s;uch a Quantity of Blood could not recover the Patient; when it really was that exce&s;&s;ive artificial Profu&s;ion of it, that downright di&s;patched him.&mdash;The Plea&s;ures of Love are very mortal Plea&s;ures to the Wounded.</P>
<P>&sect; 441. The Bal&s;ams and vulnerary Plants, which have often been &s;o highly celebrated for the Cure of Wounds, are very nox|ious, when taken inwardly; becau&s;e the Introduction of them gives or heightens the Fever, which ought to have been abated.</P>

<HEAD>Of Contu&s;ions, or Brui&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 442. A Contu&s;ion, which is commonly called a Brui&s;e, is the Effect of the forcible Impre&s;&s;ion or Stroke of a Sub&s;tance not &s;harp or cutting, on the Body of a Man, or any Animal; whe|ther &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion be violently made on the Man, as when he is &s;truck by a Stick, or by a Stone thrown at him; or whether the Man be involuntarily forced again&s;t a Po&s;t, a Stone, or any hard Sub&s;tance by a Fall; or whether, in &s;hort, he is &s;queezed and oppre&s;&s;ed betwixt two hard Bodies, as when his Finger is &s;queezed betwixt the Door and the Door-Po&s;t, or the whole Body jammed in betwixt any Carriage and the Wall. The&s;e Brui&s;es, however, are &s;till more frequent in the Country than Wounds, and commonly more dangerous too; and indeed the more &s;o, as we cannot judge &s;o exactly, and &s;o &s;oon, of the whole Injury that has been incurred; and becau&s;e all that is immediately vi&s;ible of it is often but a &s;mall Part of the real Damage attending it: &s;ince it frequently happens tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Hurt appears for a few &s;uc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ive Days; nor does it become manife&s;t, until it is too late to admit of an effectual Cure.</P>

His Manner of breathing, his A&s;pect, the Quickne&s;s, Smallne&s;s, and Irregularity of his Pul&s;e, made me apprehen&s;ive at once, that &s;ome Matter was formed within his Brea&s;t. Ne|verthele&s;s he &s;till kept up, and went about, working al&s;o at &s;ome Part of his Trade. He had fallen in removing &s;ome Ca&s;ks or Hog&s;heads; and the whole Weight of his Body had been vio|lently impre&s;&s;ed upon the right Side of his Brea&s;t. Notwith&s;tand|ing this, he was &s;en&s;ible of no Hurt at fir&s;t; but &s;ome Days af|terwards he began to feel a dull heavy Pain in that Part, which continued and brought on a Dufficulty of Breathing, Weakne&s;s, broken Sleep and Lo&s;s of Appetite. I ordered him immediately to Stillne&s;s and Repo&s;e, and advi&s;ed him to drink a Pti&s;an of Bar|ley &s;weetened with Honey, in a plentiful Quantity. He regularly obeyed only the latter Part of my Directions: yet on meeting him a few Days after, he told me he was better. The very &s;ame Week, however, I was informed he had been found dead in his Bed. The Impo&s;thume had undoubtedly broke, and &s;uffocated him.</P>
<P>&sect; 444. A young Man, run away with by his Hor&s;e, was forced with Violence again&s;t a Stable-Door, without being &s;en&s;ible of any Damage at the Time. But at the Expiration of twelve Days, he found him&s;elf attacked by &s;ome &s;uch Complaints, as generally occur at the Beginning of a Fever. This Fever was mi&s;taken for a putrid one, and he was very improperly treated, for the Fever it really was, above a Month. In &s;hort, it was agreed at a Con|&s;ultation, that Matter was collected in the Brea&s;t. In Con&s;equence of this he was more properly attended, and at length happily cured by the Operation of <HI>Empyema,</HI> after langui&s;hing a whole Year. I have publi&s;hed the&s;e two In&s;tances, to demon&s;trate the great Danger of neglecting violent Strokes or Brui&s;es; &s;ince the fir&s;t of the&s;e Patients might have e&s;caped Death; and the &s;econd a tedious and afflicting Di&s;order, if they had taken, immediately after each Accident, the nece&s;&s;ary Preca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> its Con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>&sect; 445. Whenever any Part is brui&s;ed, one of two things al|ways en&s;ues, and commonly both happen together; e&s;pecially if the Contu&s;ion is pretty con&s;iderable: Either the &s;mall Blood-ve&s;|&s;els of the contu&s;ed Part are broken, and the Blood they con|tained is &s;pread about in the adjoining Parts; or el&s;e, without &s;uch an Effu&s;ion of it, the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els have lo&s;t their Tone, their active Force, and no longer contributing to the Circulation, their Contents &s;tagnate. In each of the&s;e Ca&s;es, if Nature, either without or with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Art, does not remove the Im|pediment, an Inflammation comes on, attended with an imper|fect, unkindly Suppuration, with Putrefaction and a Gangrene; not to mention the Symptoms that ari&s;e from the Contu&s;ion of &s;ome particular Sub&s;tance, at a Nerve, a large Ve&s;&s;el, a Bone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hence we may al&s;o conceive the Danger of a Contu&s;ion, happening to any inward Part, from which the Blood is either in|ternally
<PB N="227" REF="012243_0247_0F8A6D61AF4D4C78">
effu&s;ed, or the Circulation wholly ob&s;tructed in &s;ome vi|tal Organ. This is the Cau&s;e of the &s;udden Death of Per&s;ons after a violent Fall; or of tho&s;e who have received the violent Force of heavy de&s;cending Bodies on their Heads; or of &s;ome violent Strokes, without any evident external Hurt or Mark.</P>
<P>There have been many In&s;tances of &s;udden Deaths, after one Blow on the Pit of the Stomach, which has occa&s;ioned a Rup|ture of the Spleen.</P>
<P>It is in Con&s;equence of Fall occa&s;ioning a general &s;light Con|tu&s;ion, as well internal as e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">al, that they are &s;ometimes at|tended with &s;uch grievous Con&s;equences, e&s;pecially in old Men, where Nature, already enfeebled, is le&s;s able to redre&s;s &s;uch Di&s;|orders. And thus in fact has it been, that many &s;uch, who had before enjoyed a firm State of Health, have immediately lo&s;t it after a Fall (which &s;eemed at fir&s;t to have affected them little or not at all) and langui&s;hed &s;oon after to the Moment of their Death, which &s;uch Accidents very generally accelerate.</P>
<P>&sect; 446. Different external and internal Remedies are applicable in Contu&s;ions. When the Accident has occured in a &s;light De|gree, and there has been no great nor general Shock, which might produce an internal Sorene&s;s or Contu&s;ion, external Appli|cations may be &s;ufficient. They &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch things as are adapted, fir&s;t, to attenuate and re&s;olve the effu&s;ed and &s;tag|nant Blood, which &s;hews it&s;elf &s;o apparently; and which, from its manife&s;t Blackne&s;s very &s;oon after the Contu&s;ion, becomes &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively brown, yellow, and greyi&s;h, in Proportion as the Mag|nitude of the Suffu&s;ion or Settling decrea&s;es, till at la&s;t it di&s;ap|pears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly, and the Skin recovers its Colour, without the Blood's having been di&s;charged through the external Surface, as it has been in&s;en&s;ibly and gradually di&s;&s;olved, and been taken in again by the Ve&s;&s;els: And &s;econdly, the Medicines &s;hould be &s;uch as are qualified to re&s;tore the Tone, and to recover the Strength of the affected Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Application is Vinegar, diluted, if very &s;harp, with twice as much warm Water; in which Mixture Folds of Linen are to be dipt, within which the contu&s;ed Parts are to be involved; and the&s;e Folds are to be re-moi&s;tened and re-applied every two Hours on the fir&s;t Day.</P>
<P>Par&s;ley, Chervil, and Hoa&s;eleek Leaves, lightly pounded, have al&s;o been &s;ucce&s;sfully employed; and the&s;e Applications are preferable to Vinegar, when a Wound is joined to the Brui&s;e. The Pultices, No. 68, may al&s;o be u&s;ed with Advantage.</P>
<P>&sect; 447.

Water, and the like; but a long Abu&s;e ought not to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by Pre&s;cription. The&s;e Liquids which coagulate the Blood, in|&s;tead of re&s;olving it, are truly pernicious; notwith&s;tanding they are &s;ometimes employed without any vi&s;ible Di&s;advantage, on very &s;light Occa&s;ions. Frequently by determining the &s;ettled Blood towards the Inter&s;tices of the Mu&s;cles, the fle&s;hy Parts; or &s;ometimes even by preventing the Effu&s;ion, or vi&s;ible Settling of the Blood, and fixing it, as it were, within the brui&s;ed Ve&s;&s;els, they &s;eem to be well; though this only ari&s;es from their con|centring and concealing the Evil, which, at the End of a few Months, breaks forth again in a very trouble&s;ome Shape. Of this I have &s;een &s;ome mi&s;erable Examples, whence it has been abundantly evinced, that Applications of this Sort &s;hould never be admitted; and that Vinegar &s;hould be u&s;ed in&s;tead of them. At the utmo&s;t it &s;hould only be allowed, (after there is Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e all the &s;tagnant Blood re&s;olved and re&s;orbed into the Cir|culation) to add a third Part of the Arquebu&s;ade Water to the Vinegar; with an Intention to re&s;tore &s;ome Strength to the re|laxed and weakened Parts.</P>

It is &s;till a more pernicious Practice to apply in Brui&s;es, Plai&s;ters compo&s;ed of grea&s;y Sub&s;tances, Ro&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, Gums, Earths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The mo&s;t boa&s;ted of the&s;e is always hurtful, and there have been many In&s;tances of very &s;light Contu&s;ions being aggravated into Gangrenes, by &s;uch Plai&s;ters ignorantly applied; which Brui&s;es would have been entirely &s;ubdued by the Oeconony of Nature, if left to her&s;elf in the Space of four Days.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Sacs or Suffu&s;ions of coagulated Blood, which are vi&s;i|ble under the Skin, &s;hould never be opened, except for &s;ome ur|gent Rea&s;on: &s;ince however large they may be, they in&s;en&s;ibly di&s;appear and di&s;&s;ipate; in&s;tead of which Termination, by open|ing them, they &s;ometimes terminate in a dangerous Ulceration.</P>

Then indeed, and not before, a little Brandy or Arquebu&s;ade Water, may be added to the Vi|negar; and the Part (which is almo&s;t con&s;tantly the Foot) &s;hould be &s;trengthened and &s;ecured for a con&s;iderable Time with a Ban|dage; as it might otherwi&s;e be liable to fre&s;h Sprains, which would daily more and more enfeeble it; for if this Evil is over|looked too much in its Infancy, the Part never recovers its full Strength; and a &s;mall Swelling often remains to the End of the Patient's Life.</P>
<P>If the Sprain is very &s;light and moderate, a Plunging of the Part into cold Water is excellent; bat if this is not done at once immediately after the Sprain, or if the Contu&s;ion is violent, it is even hurtful.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;tom of rolling the naked Foot upon &s;ome round Body is in&s;ufficient, when the Bones are not perfectly replaced; and hurtful, when the Sprain is accompanied with a Contu&s;ion.</P>
<P>It happens continually almo&s;t, that Country People, who en|counter &s;uch Accidents, apply them&s;elves either to ignorant or knavi&s;h Impo&s;ters, who find, or are determined to find, a Di&s;or|der or Di&s;location of the Bones, where there is none; and who, by their violent Manner of handling the Parts, or by the Plai|&s;ters they &s;urround them with, bring on a dangerous Inflammation, and change the Patient's Dread of a &s;mall Di&s;order, into a very grievous Malady.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the very Per&s;ons who have created, or indeed rather imagined, &s;ome impo&s;&s;ible Di&s;ea&s;es, &s;uch as the Opening, the Splitting of the Stomach, and of the Kidnies. Such mon&s;trous Words terrify the poor Country People, and di&s;po&s;e them to be more ea&s;ily and effectually duped.</P>

<HEAD>Of Ulcers.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 453. Whenever Ulcers ari&s;e from a general Fault of the Blood, it is impo&s;&s;ible to cure them, without de&s;troying the Cau&s;e and Fuel of them It is in fact imprudent to attempt to heal them up by outward Remedies; and a real Misfortune to the Patient, if his A&s;&s;i&s;tant effectually heals and clo&s;es them.</P>
<P>But, for the greater Part, Ulcers in the Country are the Con|&s;equences of &s;ome Wound, Brui&s;e, or Tumour improperly treat|ed; and e&s;pecially of &s;uch as have been dre&s;&s;ed with too &s;harp, or too &s;pirituous Applications. Rancid Oils are al&s;o one of the Cau&s;es, which change the mo&s;t &s;imple Wounds into ob&s;tinate Ul|cers,
<PB N="231" REF="012243_0251_0F8A6D66F1CE32C8">
for which Rea&s;on they &s;hould be avoided ; and Apotheca|ries &s;hould be careful, when they compound grea&s;y Ointments, to make but little at a Time, and the oftner, as a very con&s;iderable Quantity of any of them becomes tank before it is all &s;old; not|with&s;tanding &s;weet fre&s;h Oil may have been employed in prepar|ing them.</P>
<P>&sect; 454. What &s;erves to di&s;tingui&s;h Ulcers from Wounds, is the Dryne&s;s and Hardne&s;s of the Sides or Borders of Ulcers, and the Quality of the Humour di&s;charged from them; which, in&s;tead of being ripe con&s;i&s;tent Matter, is a Liquid more thin, le&s;s white, &s;ometimes yielding a di&s;agreeable Scent, and &s;o very &s;harp, that if it touch the adjoining Skin, it produces Redne&s;s, Inflamma|tion, or Pu&s;tules there; &s;ometimes a &s;erpiginous, or Ring-worm like Eruption, and even a further Ulceration.</P>
<P>&sect; 455. Such Ulcers as are of a long Duration, which &s;pread wide, and di&s;charge much, prey upon the Patient, and throw him into a &s;low Fever, which melts and con&s;umes him. Be&s;ides, when an Ulcer is of a long Standing, it is dangerous to dry it up; and indeed this never &s;hould be done, but by &s;ub&s;tituting in the Place of one Di&s;charge, that is become almo&s;t natural, &s;ome other Evacuation, &s;uch as purging from time to time.</P>
<P>We may daily &s;ee &s;udden Deaths, or very tormenting Di&s;ea&s;es, en&s;ue the &s;udden drying up &s;uch Humours and Drains as have been of a long Continuance: and whenever any Quack (and as many as promi&s;e the &s;peedy Cure of &s;uch, de&s;erve that Title) a&s;|&s;ures the Patient of his curing an inveterate Ulcer in a few Days, he demon&s;trates him&s;elf to be a very dangerous and ignorant In|termeddler, who mu&s;t kill the Patient, if he keeps his Word. Some of the&s;e impudent Impo&s;tors make u&s;e of the mo&s;t corro|&s;ive Applications, and even ar&s;enical ones; notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t violent Death is generally the Con&s;equence of them.</P>
<P>&sect; 456. The utmo&s;t that Art can effect, with Regard to Ulcers, which do not ari&s;e from any Fault in the Humours, is to change them into Wounds. To this End, the Hardne&s;s and Dryne&s;s of the Edges of the Ulcer, and indeed of the whole Ulcer, mu&s;t be dimini&s;hed, and its Inflammation removed. But &s;ometimes the Hardne&s;s is &s;o ob&s;tinate, that this cannot be mollified any other Way, than by &s;carifying the Edges with a Lancet. But when it may be effected by other Means, let a Pledget &s;pread with the Ointment No. 69, be applied all over the Ulcer; and this Pled|get be covered again with a Compre&s;s of &s;everal Folds, moi&s;tened in the Liquid No. 70, which &s;hould be renewed three times daily; though it is &s;ufficient to apply a fre&s;h Pledget only twice.</P>
<P>As I have already affirmed that Ulcers were often the Con&s;e|quences of &s;harp and &s;pirituous Dre&s;&s;ings, it is evident &s;uch &s;hould be ab&s;tained from, without which Ab&s;tinence they will prove in|curable.</P>
<P>To forward the Cure, &s;alted Food, Spices, and &s;trong Drink &s;hould be avoided; the Quantity of Fle&s;h-meat &s;hould be le&s;&s;ened;
<PB N="232" REF="012243_0252_0F8A6D67C5114590">
and the Body be kept open by a Regimen of Puls, or Vegetables, and by the habitual U&s;e of Whey &s;weetened with Honey.</P>
<P>If the Ulcers are in the Legs, a very common Situation of them, it is of great Importance, as well as in Wounds of the &s;ame Parts, that the Patients &s;hould walk about but little; and yet never &s;tand up without walking. This indeed is one of the&s;e Ca&s;es, in which tho&s;e, who have &s;ome Credit and Influence in the E&s;timation of the People, &s;hould omit nothing to make them thoroughly comprehend the Nece&s;&s;ity of confining them&s;elves, &s;ome Days, to undi&s;turbed Tranquillity and Re&s;t; and they &s;hould al&s;o convince them, that this Term of Re&s;t is &s;o far from being lo&s;t Time, that it is likely to prove their mo&s;t profitable Time of Life. Negligence, in this material Point, changes the &s;light|e&s;t Wounds into Ulcers, and the mo&s;t trifling Ulcers into ob&s;ti|nate and incurable ones: in&s;omuch that there is &s;carcely any Man, who may not ob&s;erve &s;ome Family in his Neighbourhood, re|duced to the Ho&s;pital <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;eems ju&s;t the &s;ame as <HI>coming on the Pari&s;h,</HI> or being received into an Alms-hou&s;e, here; in Con&s;equence of &s;uch an incurable Di&s;ability happening to the poor working Father of a Family. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE>, from their having been too inattentive to the due Care of &s;ome Complaint of this Sort.</P>
<P>I conclude this Article on Ulcers with repeating, that tho&s;e which are owing to &s;ome internal Cau&s;e; or even &s;uch as happen from an external one, in Per&s;ons of a bad Habit of Body, fre|quently require a more particular Treatment.</P>

<P>&sect; 457. It is but too common, in very rigorous Winters, for &s;ome Per&s;ons to be pierced with &s;o violent a Degree of Cold, that their Hands or Feet, or &s;ometimes both together, are frozen at once, ju&s;t like a Piece of Fle&s;h meat expo&s;ed to the Air.</P>

Some grea&s;y Ointments were applied hot to them, the Con&s;e|quence of which was, the Nece&s;&s;ity of cutting off &s;ix of his Fin|gers.</P>
<P>&sect; 458. In &s;hort, there is but one certain Remedy in &s;uch Ca&s;es, and this is to convey the Per&s;on affected into &s;ome Place where it does not freeze, but where, however, it is but very moderately hot, and there continually to apply, to the frozen Parts, Snow, if it be at Hand; and if not, to keep wa&s;hing them ince&s;&s;antly, but very gently (&s;ince all Friction would at this Juncture prove dangerous in Ice-water, as the Ice thaws in the Chamber. By this Application the Patients will be &s;en&s;ible of their Feelings returning very gradually to the Part) and that they begin to recover their Motion. In this State they may &s;afely be moved into a Place a little warmer, and drink &s;ome Cups of the Potion No. 13, or of another of the like Quality.</P>
<P>&sect; 459. Every Per&s;on may be a competent Judge of the manife&s;t Danger of attempting to relieve &s;uch Parts by heating them, and of the U&s;e of Ice-water, by a common, a daily Experience. Fro|zen Pears, Apples and Radi&s;hes, being put into Water ju&s;t about to Freeze, recover their former State, and prove quickly eatable. But if they are put into warm Water, or into a hot Place, Rotten|ne&s;s, which is one Sort of Grangene, is the immediate Effect. The following Ca&s;e will make this right Method of treating them &s;till more intelligible, and demon&s;trate its Efficacy.</P>
<P>A Man was travelling to the Di&s;tance of &s;ix Leagues in very cold Weather, the Road being covered with Snow and Ice. His Shoes, not being very good, failed him on his March, &s;o that he walked the three la&s;t Leagues bare-footed; and felt, immediately after the fir&s;t Half-League, &s;harp Pains in his Legs and Feet, which increa&s;ed as he proceeded. He arrived at his Journey's End in a Manner nearly deprived of his lower Extremities. They &s;et him before a great Fire, heated a Bed well, and put him into it. His Pains imediately became intolerable: he was ince&s;&s;antly in the mo&s;t violent Agitations, and cried out in the mo&s;t piercing and affecting Manner. A Phy&s;ician being &s;ent for in the Night, found his Toes of a blacki&s;h Colour, and beginning to lo&s;e their Feeling. His Legs and the upper Part of his Feet, which were exce&s;&s;ively &s;welled, of a purpli&s;h Red, and varied with Spots of a violet Colour, were &s;till &s;en&s;ible of the mo&s;t excruciating Pains. The Phy&s;ician ordered in a Pail of Water from the adjoining Ri|ver, adding more to it, and &s;ome Ice withall. In this he obliged the Patient to plunge his Legs; they were kept in near an Hour, and within that Time, the Pains became le&s;s violent. After an|other Hour he ordered a &s;econd cold Bath, from which the Pa|tient perceiving &s;till further Relief, prolonged it to the Extent of two Hours. During that Time, &s;ome Water was taken out of the Pail, and &s;ome Ice and Snow were put into it. Now his Toes, which had been black, grew red; the violet Spots in his Legs di&s;appeared; the Swelling abated; the Pains became moderate,
<PB N="234" REF="012243_0254_0F8A6D68C63445A8">
and intermitted. The Bath was neverthele&s;s repeated &s;ix Times; after which there remained no other Complaint, but that of a great Tenderne&s;s or extraordinary Sen&s;ibility in the Soles of his Feet, which hindered him from walking. The Parts were after|wards bathed with &s;ome aromatic Fomentations; and he drank a Pti&s;an of Sar&s;aparilla [one of Elder Flowers would have an&s;wer|ed the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, and have been le&s;s expen&s;ive.] On the eighth Day from his Seizure he was perfectly recovered, and re|turned home on Foot on the fifteenth.</P>
<P>&sect; 460. When cold Weather is extremely &s;evere, and a Per&s;on is expo&s;ed to it for a long Time at once, it proves mortal, in Con|&s;equence of its congealing the Blood, and becau&s;e it forces too great a Proportion of Blood up the Brain; &s;o that the Patient dies of a Kind of Apoplexy, which is preceeded by a Sleepine&s;s, In this Circum&s;tance the Traveller, who finds he grows drow&s;y, &s;hould redouble his Efforts to extricate him&s;elf from the eminent Danger he is expo&s;ed to. This Sleep, which he might con&s;ider as &s;ome Allevation of his Sufferings, if indulged, would prove his la&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect; 461. The Remedies in &s;uch Ca&s;es are the &s;ame with tho&s;e directed in frozen Limbs. The Patient mu&s;t he conducted to an Apartment rather cold than hot, and be rubbed with Snow or with Ice-water. There have been many well atte&s;ted In&s;tances of this Method: and as &s;uch Ca&s;es are &s;till more frequent in more northern Climates, a Bath of the very colde&s;t Water has been found the &s;ure&s;t Remedy.</P>
<P>Since it is known that many People have been revived, who had remained in the Snow, or had been expo&s;ed to the freezing Air during five, or even &s;ix &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Days, and who had di&s;covered no one Mark of Life for &s;everal Hours, the utmo&s;t Endeavours &s;hould be u&s;ed for the Recovery of Per&s;ons in the like Circum&s;tan|ces and Situation.</P>

<HEAD>Of Kibes, or Chilblains.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 462. The&s;e trouble&s;ome and &s;marting Complaints attack the Hands, Feet, Heels, Ears, No&s;e and Lips, tho&s;e of Children e&s;pe|cially, and mo&s;tly in Winter; when the&s;e extremities are expo&s;ed to the &s;udden Changes from hot to cold, and from cold to hot Weather. They begin with an Inflation or Kind of Swelling, which, at fir&s;t, occa&s;ions but little Heat, Pain or Itching. Some|times they do not exceed this fir&s;t State, and go off &s;pontaneou&s;|ly without any Application: But at other Times, which may be termed the &s;econd Degree of the Di&s;order (whether it happens from their being neglected, or improperly treated) their Heat, Redne&s;s, Itching and Pain increa&s;e con&s;iderably; &s;o that the Pa|tient is often deprived of the free U&s;e of his Fingers by the Pain, Swelling and Numbne&s;s: in which Ca&s;e the Malady is &s;till aggra|vated, if effectual Means are not u&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="012243_0255_0F8A6D6AF15885C8">Whenever the Inflammation mounts to a &s;till higher Degree, &s;mall Ve&s;ications or Bli&s;ters are formed, which are not long with|out bur&s;ting; when they leave a &s;light Excoriation, or Rawne&s;s, as it were, which &s;peedily ulcerates, and frequently proves a ve|ry deep and ob&s;tinate Ulcer, di&s;charging a &s;harp and ill-condi|tioned Matter.</P>
<P>The la&s;t and mo&s;t virulent Degree of Chilblains, which is not infrequent in the very colde&s;t Countries, though very rare in the temperate ones, is, when the Inflammation degenerates into a Gangrene.</P>
<P>&sect; 463. The&s;e Tumors are owing to a Fulne&s;s and Ob&s;truction of the Ve&s;&s;els of the Skin, which occurs from this Circum&s;tance, that the Veins, which are more &s;uperficial than the Arteries, be|ing proportionably more affected and &s;traitened by the Cold, do not carry off all the Blood communicated to them by the Arte|ries; and perhaps al&s;o the Particles or Atoms of Cold, which are admitted through the Pores of the Skin, may act upon our Fluids, as it does upon Water, and occa&s;ion a Congelation of them, or a con&s;iderable Approach towards it.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Complaints are chiefly felt, which in fact is the Ca&s;e, rather on the extreme Parts than on others, it ari&s;es from two Cau&s;es, the fir&s;t of which is, that the Circulation's being weaker at the Extremities than el&s;ewhere, the Effect of tho&s;e Cau&s;es, that may impair it, mu&s;t be more con&s;iderably felt there. The &s;econd Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e the&s;e Parts are more expo&s;ed to the Im|pre&s;&s;ions from without than the others.</P>
<P>They occur mo&s;t frequently to Children, from their Weakne&s;s and the greater Tenderne&s;s, and Sen&s;ibility of their Organs, which nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e the Effect of external Impre&s;&s;ions. It is the fre|quent and &s;trong Alteration from Heat to Cold, that &s;eems to contribute the mo&s;t powerfully to the Production of Chilblains; and this Effect of it is mo&s;t con&s;iderable, when the Heat of the Air is at the &s;ame Time blended with Moi&s;ture; whence the ex|treme and &s;uperficial Parts pa&s;s &s;uddenly as it were, out of a hot, into a cold Bath. A Man &s;ixty Years of Age, who never before was troubled with Kibes, having worn, for &s;ome Hours on a Jour|ney, a Pair of furred Gloves, in which his Hands &s;weated, felt them very tender, and found them &s;welled up with Blood; as the common Effect of the warm Bath is to &s;often and relax, and to draw Blood abundantly to the bathed Parts, whence it renders them more &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>This Man, I &s;ay, thus circum&s;tanced, was at that Age fir&s;t attacked with Chilblains, which proved extremely trouble&s;ome; and he was every &s;ucceeding Winter as certainly infe&s;ted with them, within half an Hour after he left off his Gloves, and was expo&s;ed to a very cold Air.</P>
<P>It is for this Rea&s;on, that &s;everal Per&s;ons are never infe&s;ted with Chilblains, but when they u&s;e them&s;elves to Muffs, which, we &s;carcely known in hot Countries; nor are they very common
<PB N="236" REF="012243_0256_0F8A6D6B16B18648">
among the more northern ones, in which the extraordinary Chan|ges from Cold to Heat are very rare and unu&s;ual.</P>
<P>Some People are &s;ubject to this trouble&s;ome Complaint in the Fall; while others have it only in the Spring. The Child of a labouring Pea&s;ant, who has a hard Skin, and one inured to all the Impre&s;&s;ions of the Sea&s;ons and of the Elements, is, and indeed nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t be, le&s;s liable to Kibes, than the Child of a rich Citizen, who&s;e Skin is often cheri&s;hed, at the Expence of his Con|&s;titution. But even among Children of the &s;ame Rank in Life and Circum&s;tances, who &s;eem pretty much of the &s;ame Complex|ion, and live much in the &s;ame Manner; (whence they might of Cour&s;e be &s;uppo&s;ed equally liable to the &s;ame Impre&s;&s;ions, and to the like Effects of them) there is, neverthele&s;s, a very great Dif|ference with re&s;pect to their con&s;titutional Propen&s;ity to contract Chilblains. Some are very cruelly tormented with them, from the &s;etting-in of Autumn, to the very End of the Spring: others have either none an all, or have them but very &s;lightly, and for a very &s;hort Time. This Difference undoubtedly ari&s;es from the different Quality of their Humours, and the Texture of their whole Surface, but particularly from that of the Skin of their Hands; though we readily confe&s;s it is by no Means ea&s;y to de|termine, with Certainty and Preci&s;ion, in what this Difference e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Children of a &s;anguine Complexion and delicate Skin are pret|ty generally &s;ubject to this Di&s;order, which is often regarded much too &s;lightly, though it is really &s;evere enough to engage our At|tention more; &s;ince, even ab&s;tracted from the &s;harp Pains which &s;mart the&s;e unhappy Children for &s;everal Months; it &s;ometimes gives them a Fever, hinders them from &s;leeping, and yet confines them to their Bed, which is very prejudicial to their Con&s;titutions. It al&s;o breaks in upon the Order of their different Duties and Em|ployments; it interrupts their innocent &s;alutary Plea&s;ures; and &s;ometimes, when they are obliged to earn their daily Bread by doing &s;ome Work or other, it &s;inks them down to Mi&s;ery. I knew a young Man, who from being rendered incapable by Chilblains, of &s;erving out his Apprentice&s;hip to a Watch-maker, is become a lazy Beggar.</P>
<P>Chilblains which attack the No&s;e, often leave a Mark that al|ters the Phy&s;iognomy, the A&s;pect of the Patient for the Remain|der of his Life: and the Hands of &s;uch as have &s;uffered from very ob&s;tinate ones, are commonly ever &s;en&s;ible of their Con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>&sect; 464. With Re&s;pect, therefore, to the&s;e afflicting Tumours and Ulcerations, we &s;hould, in the fir&s;t Place, do our utmo&s;t to prevent them; and next to exert our be&s;t Endeavours to cure &s;uch as we could not prevent.</P>
<P>&sect; 465. Since they manife&s;tly depend on the Sen&s;ibility of the Skin, the Nature of the Humours, and the Changes of the Wea|ther from Heat to Cold, in order to prevent them, in the fir&s;t
<PB N="237" REF="012243_0257_0F8A6D6C1D505560">
Place, the Skin mu&s;t be rendered firmer or le&s;s tender. 2, That vicious Quality of the Temperament, which cantributes to their Exi&s;tence, mu&s;t be corrected; and, 3, the Per&s;ons &s;o liable, mu&s;t guard them&s;elves as well as po&s;&s;ible, again&s;t the&s;e Changes of the Weather.</P>
<P>Now the Skin of the Hands, as well as that of the whole Body, may be &s;trengthened by that Habit of wa&s;hing or bathing in cold Water, which I have de&s;cribed at large, &sect; 384; and in fact, I have never &s;een Children, who had been early accu&s;tomed and inured to this Habit, as much afflicted with Chilblains as o|thers. But &s;till a more particular Regard &s;hould be had to forti|fy the Skin of the Hands, which are more obnoxious to this Di&s;|order than the Feet, by making Children dip them in cold Wa|ter, and keep them for &s;ome Moments together in it every Morn|ing, and every Evening too, before Supper, from the very Be|gining of the Fall. It will give the Children no Sort of Pain, during that Sea&s;on, to contract this Habit; and when it is once contracted, it will give them no Trouble to continue it through|out the Winter, even when the Water is ready to freeze every where. They may al&s;o be habituated to plunge their Feet into cold Water twice or thrice a Week; and this Method, which might be le&s;s adapted for grown Per&s;ons, who had not been ac|cu&s;tomed to it, mu&s;t be without Objection with re&s;pect to &s;uch Children, as have been accu&s;tomed to it; to whom all its Con&s;e|quences mu&s;t be u&s;eful and &s;alutary.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time Care mu&s;t be taken not to defeat or le&s;&s;en the Effect of the cold bathing, by &s;uffering the Bather or Wa&s;her, to grow too warm between two Baths or Dippings; which is al&s;o avoiding the too &s;peedy Succe&s;&s;ions of Heat and Cold. For this Purpo&s;e, 1, the Children mu&s;t be taught never to warm their Hands before the Fire at &s;uch Times, and &s;till le&s;s before the Stoves, which very probably are one of the principal Cau&s;es of Chilblains, that are le&s;s u&s;ual in Countries which u&s;e no &s;uch Stoves, and among tho&s;e Individuals who make the lea&s;t U&s;e of them, where they are. Above all, the U&s;e of <HI>Cavettes</HI> (that is, of Seats, or little Stairs, as it were, contrived between the Stove and Wall) is prejudicial to Children, and even to grown People, up|on &s;everal Accounts. 2, They &s;hould never accu&s;tom them&s;elves to wear Muffs. 3, It would be al&s;o proper they &s;hould never u&s;e Gloves, unle&s;s &s;ome particular Circum&s;tances require it; and I recommend this Ab&s;tinence from Gloves, e&s;pecially to young Boys: but if any &s;hould be allowed them, let the Gloves be thin and &s;mooth.</P>
<P>&sect; 466. When Chilblains &s;eem to be nouri&s;hed by &s;ome Fault in the Temperament or Humours, the Con&s;ideration of a Phy&s;ician becomes nece&s;&s;ary, to direct a proper Method of removing or al|tering it. I have &s;een Children from the Age of three, to that of twelve or thirteen Years, in whom their Chilblains, raw and flead, as it were, for eight Months of the Year, &s;eemed to be a
<PB N="238" REF="012243_0258_0F8A6D6C8CFDE5B0">
particular Kind of I&s;&s;ue, by which Nature freed her&s;elf of an in|convenient Superfluity of Humours, when the Per&s;piration was dimini&s;hed by the Abatement of the violent Heats. In &s;uch Ca|&s;es I have been obliged to carry them through a pretty long Cour&s;e of Regimen and Remedies; which, however, being nece&s;&s;arily various from a Variety of Circum&s;tances, cannot be detailed here. The milder Preparations of Antimony are often nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch Ca&s;es; and &s;ome Purges conduce in particular ones to allay and to &s;horten the Di&s;order.</P>
<P>&sect; 467. The fir&s;t Degree of this Complaint goes off, as I have already &s;aid, without the Aid of Medicine; or &s;hould it prove &s;omewhat more ob&s;tinate, it may ea&s;ily be di&s;&s;ipated by &s;ome of the following Remedies. But when they ri&s;e to the &s;econd Degree, they mu&s;t be treated like other Complaints from Congelation, or Fro&s;t-biting (of which they are the fir&s;t Degree) with cold Wa|ter, Ice-water and Snow.</P>
<P>No other Method or Medicine is nearly as efficacious as very cold Water, &s;o as to be ready to freeze, in which the Hands are to be dipt and retained for &s;ome Minutes together, and &s;everal Times daily. In &s;hort it is the only Remedy which ought to be applied, when the Hands are the Parts affected; when the Pa|tient has the Courage to bear this Degree of Cold; and when he is under no Circum&s;tance which may render it prejudicial. It is the only application I have u&s;ed for my&s;elf, after having been attacked with Chilblains for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, from having accu&s;|tomed my&s;elf to too warm a Muff.</P>
<P>There en&s;ues a &s;light Degree of Pain for &s;ome Moments after plunging the Hand into Water, but it dimini&s;hes gradually. On taking the Hand out, the fingers are numbed with the Cold, but they pre&s;ently grow warm again; and within a Quarter of an Hour, it is entirely over.</P>
<P>The Hands on being taken out of the Water, are to be well dried, and put into Skin Gloves; after bathing three or four Times, their Swelling &s;ub&s;ides, &s;o that the Skin wrinkles: but by continuing the cold Bathing, it grows tight and &s;mooth again; the Cure is compleated after u&s;ing it three or four Days; and, in general, the Di&s;order never returns again the &s;ame Winter.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t trouble&s;ome raging Itching is certainly a&s;&s;waged by plunging the Hands into cold Water.</P>
<P>The Effect of Snow is, perhaps, &s;till more &s;peedy: the Hands are to be gently and often rubbed with it for a con&s;iderable Time; they grow hot, and are of a very high Red for &s;ome Moments, but entire Ea&s;e very quickly &s;ucceeds.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, a very &s;mall Number of Per&s;ons, who mu&s;t have extremely delicate and &s;en&s;ible Skins, do not experience the Effi|cacy of this Application. It &s;eems too active for them; it affects the Skin much like a common bli&s;tering Plai&s;ter; and by bring|ing on a large Flow of Humours there, it increa&s;es, in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening, the Complaint.</P>

<P>One of the be&s;t is to wear Day and Night, without ever putting it off, a Glove made of any &s;mooth Skin, &s;uch as that of a Dog; which &s;eldom fails to extingui&s;h the Di&s;order in &s;ome Days Time.</P>

Such is that celebrated Decoction of the Scrapings, the Peal of Radi|&s;hes, who&s;e Efficacy is &s;till further increa&s;ed, by adding one &s;ixth Part of Vinegar to the Decoction.</P>
<P>Another Decoction, of who&s;e great Efficacy I have been a Wit|ne&s;s, but which dies the Hands yellow for a few Days, is the Pre|&s;cription No. 71. Many others may be made, of nearly the &s;ame Virtues, with all the vulnerary Herbs, and even with the <HI>Faltranc.</HI></P>

<P>As &s;oon as the Hands affected are taken out of the&s;e Decoctions, they mu&s;t be defended from the Air by Gloves.</P>
<P>&sect; 470. Vapours or Steams are often more efficacious than De|coctions; whence in&s;tead of dipping the Hands into the&s;e already mentioned, we may expo&s;e them to their Vapours, with &s;till more Succe&s;s.

<P>&sect; 471. When the No&s;e is affected with a Chilblain, the Steam of Vinegar, and an artificial No&s;e, or Covering for it, made of Dog-&s;kin, are the mo&s;t effectual Applications.

<HEAD>Of Ruptures.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 475. <HI>Hernias</HI> or Ruptures, which Country People term <HI>be|ing bur&s;ten,</HI> are a Di&s;order which &s;ometimes occurs at the very Birth; though more frequently they are the Effects of violent crying, of a &s;trong forcing Cough, or of repeated Efforts to vo|mit in the fir&s;t Months of Infancy.</P>
<P>They may happen afterwards indi&s;criminately at every Age, either as Con&s;equences of particular Maladies, or Accidents, or from People's violent Exertions of their Strength. They hap|pen much oftener to Men than Women; and the mo&s;t common Sort, indeed the only one of which I propo&s;e to treat, and that but briefly, is that which con&s;i&s;ts in the De&s;cent of a Part of the Guts, or of the Cawl, into the Bag or Cod-piece.</P>
<P>It is not difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h this Rupture. When it occurs in little Children, it is almo&s;t ever cured by making them con|&s;tantly wear a Bandage, which &s;hould be made only of Fu&s;tian, with a little Pillow or Pincu&s;hion, &s;tuffed with Linen Rags, Hair
<PB N="241" REF="012243_0261_0F8A6D6EE3B80330">
or Bran. There &s;hould be at lea&s;t two of the&s;e Bandages, to change them alternately; nor &s;hould it ever be applied, but when the Child is laid down on its Back, and after being well a&s;&s;ured that the Gut or Cawl, which had fallen down, has been &s;afely re|turned into the Cavity of the Belly; &s;ince without this Precaution it might occa&s;ion the wor&s;t Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The good Effect of the Bandage may be &s;till further promoted, by applying upon the Skin, and within the Plait or Fold of the Groin (under which Place the Rings, or Pa&s;&s;age out of the Belly into the Bag lie) &s;ome pretty a&s;tringent or &s;trengthening Plai&s;ter, &s;uch as that commonly u&s;ed for Fractures, or that I have already mentioned, &sect; 144. Here we may ob&s;erve by the Way, that rup|tured Children &s;hould never be &s;et on a Hor&s;e, nor be carried by any Per&s;on on Hor&s;eback, before the Rupture is perfectly cured.</P>
<P>&sect; 476. In a more advanced Age, a Bandage only of Fu&s;tian is not &s;ufficient; one mu&s;t be procured with a Plate of Steel, even &s;o as to con&s;train and incommode the Wearer a little at fir&s;t: ne|verthele&s;s it &s;oon becomes habitual, and is then no longer incon|venient to him.</P>
<P>&sect; 477. Ruptures &s;ometimes attain a mon&s;trous Size; and a great Part of the Guts fall down into the <HI>Scrotum</HI> or Bag, with|out any Symptom of an actual Di&s;ea&s;e. This Circum&s;tance, ne|verthele&s;s, is accompanied with very great Inconvenience, which di&s;ables Per&s;ons affected with it to work; and whenever the Ma|lady is &s;o con&s;iderable, and of a long Standing too, there are commonly &s;ome Ob&s;tacles that prevent a compleat Return of the Guts into the Belly. In this State indeed, the Application of the Bandage or Tru&s;s is impracticable, and the mi&s;erable Patients are condemned to carry their grievous Burthen for the Remainder of their Lives; which may however be palliated a little by the U&s;e of a Su&s;pen&s;ory and Bag, adapted to the Size of the Rupture. This Dread of its increa&s;ing Magnitude is a &s;trong Motive for checking the Progre&s;s of it, when it fir&s;t appears. But there is another &s;till &s;tronger; which is, that Ruptures expo&s;e the Patient to a Symptom frequently mortal. This occurs when that Part of the Inte&s;tines fallen into the <HI>Scrotum</HI> inflames; when &s;till increa&s;|ing in its Bulk, and being extremely compre&s;&s;ed, acute Pains come on: for now from the Increa&s;e of the Rupture's Extent, the Pa&s;|&s;age which gave Way to it's De&s;cent, cannot admit of its Return or A&s;cent; the Blood-ve&s;&s;els them&s;elves being oppre&s;&s;ed, the In|flammation increa&s;es every Moment; the Communication between the Stomach and the Fundament is often entirely cut off; &s;o that nothing pa&s;&s;es through, but ince&s;&s;ant Vomitings come on [this being the Kind of <HI>Mi&s;erere,</HI> or Iliac Pa&s;&s;ion I have mentioned, &sect; 320] which are &s;ucceeded by the Hickup, Raving, Swooning, cold Sweats, and Death.</P>
<P>&sect; 478. This Symptom &s;upervenes in Ruptures, when the Ex|crements become hard in that Part of the Guts fallen into the <HI>Scrotum</HI>; when the Patient is overheated with Wine, Drams, an

<P>&sect; 479. The be&s;t Means and Remedies are, 1, as &s;oon as ever this Symptom or Accident is manife&s;t, to bleed the Patient very plentifully, as he lies down in his Bed and upon his Back, with his Head a little rai&s;ed, and his Legs &s;omewhat bent, &s;o that his Knees may be erect. This is the Attitude or Po&s;ture they &s;hould always pre&s;erve as much as po&s;&s;ible. When the Malady is not too far ad|vanced, the fir&s;t Bleeding often makes a complete Cure; and the Guts return up as &s;oon as it is over. At other Times this Bleed|ing is le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful, and leaves a Nece&s;&s;ity for its Repetition.</P>
<P>2, A Gly&s;ter mu&s;t be thrown up con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;trong Decoc|tion of the large white Beet Leaves, with a &s;mall Spoonful or Pinch of common Salt, and a Bit of fre&s;h Butter of the Size of an Egg.</P>
<P>3, Folds of Linen dipt in Ice-water mu&s;t be applied all over the Tumour, and con&s;tantly renewed every Quarter of an Hour.&mdash; This Remedy, when immediately applied, has produced the mo&s;t happy Effects; but if the Symptom has endured violently more than ten or twelve Hours, it is often too late to apply it; and then it is better to make U&s;e of Flannels dipt in a warm Decoc|tion of Mallow and Elder Flowers, &s;hifting them frequently. It has been known however, that Ice-water, or Ice it&s;elf has &s;uc|ceeded as late as the third Day. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pieces of Ice applied between two Pieces of Linen, directly upon the Rup|ture, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after its fir&s;t Appearance, is one of tho&s;e extraordinary Remedies, which we &s;hould never he&s;itate to make immediate U&s;e of.

<P>5, And la&s;tly, If all the&s;e Attempts are fruitle&s;s, the Opera|tion mu&s;t be re&s;olved on, without lo&s;ing a Moment's Time; as this local Di&s;ea&s;e proves &s;ometimes mortal in the Space of two Days; but for this Operation an excellent Surgeon is indi&s;pen&s;a|bly nece&s;&s;ary. The happy Con&s;equence with which I have or|dered it, in a mo&s;t de&s;perate Ca&s;e &s;ince the fir&s;t Edition of this Work, on the &s;ixth Day after a Labour, has convinced me, &s;till more than any former Ob&s;ervation I had made, that the Trial of it ought never to be omitted, when other Attempts have been un|availing. It cannot even ha&s;ten the Patient's Death, which mu&s;t be inevitable without it, but it rather renders that more gentle, where it might fail to prevent it. When it is performed as Mr. LEVADE effected it, in the Ca&s;e I have ju&s;t referred to, the Pain attending it is very tolerable and &s;oon over.</P>

<P>A certain Woman in this Place, but now dead, had the great and impudent Temerity to attempt this Operation, and killed her Patients after the mo&s;t excruciating Torments, and an Extir|pation, or cutting away, of the Te&s;ticle; which Quacks and ig|norant Surgeons always do, but which a good Surgeon never does in this Operation.

When Suppuration is effected, if the Matter lies very deep, and is &s;harp; or if the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of a Surgeon has arrived too late, the Bone of the la&s;t <HI>Phalanx,</HI> or Row of Bones of the Finger, is generally carious and lo&s;t. But how gentle &s;oever the Complaint has been, the Nail is very generally &s;eparated and falls off.</P>
<P>&sect; 484. The internal Treatment in Whitlows, is the &s;ame with that in other inflammatory Di&s;tempers. The Patient mu&s;t enter upon a Regimen more or le&s;s &s;trict, in Proportion to the Degree of the Fever; and if this runs very high, and the Inflammation be very con&s;iderable, there may be a Nece&s;&s;ity for &s;everal Bleed|ings.</P>
<P>The external Treatment con&s;i&s;ts in allaying the Inflammation; in &s;oftening the Skin; and in procuring a Di&s;charge of the Mat|ter, as &s;oon as it is formed. For this Purpo&s;e,</P>
<P>1, The Finger affected is to be plunged, as &s;oon as the Di&s;order is manife&s;t, in Water a little more than warm: the Steam of boil|ing Water may al&s;o be directed into it; and by doing the&s;e things almo&s;t con&s;tantly for the fir&s;t Day, a total Di&s;&s;ipation of the Ma|lady has often been obtained. But unhappily it has been generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;uch &s;light Attacks could have but very &s;light Con&s;equences, whence they have been neglected until the Di&s;or|der has greatly advanced; in which State Suppuration becomes ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>2, This Suppuration therefore may be forwarded, by continu|ally involving the Finger, as it were, in a Decoction of Mallow Flowers boiled in Milk, or with a Catapla&s;m of Bread and Milk. This may be rendered &s;till more active and ripening, by adding a few white Lilly Roots, or a little Honey. But this la&s;t mu&s;t not be applied before the Inflammation is &s;omewhat abated, and Sup|puration begins; before which Term, all &s;harp Applications are very dangerous. At this Time, Yea&s;t or Leaven may be ad|vantageou&s;ly u&s;ed, which powerfully promotes Suppuration. The Sorrel Pultice, mentioned &sect; 480, is al&s;o a very efficacious one.</P>
<P>&sect; 485. A &s;peedy Di&s;charge of the ripe Matter is of con&s;idera|ble Importance, but this particularly requires the Attention of the Surgeon; as it is not proper to wait till the Tumour breaks and di&s;charges of it&s;elf; and this the rather, as from the Skin's prov|ing &s;ometimes extremely hard, the Matter might be inwardly ef|fu&s;ed between the Mu&s;cles, and upon their Membranes, before it could penetrate through the Skin. For this Rea&s;on, as &s;oon as Matter is &s;u&s;pected to be formed, a Surgeon &s;hould be called in, to determine exactly on the Time, when an Opening &s;hould be made; which had better be performed a little too &s;oon than too late; and a little too deep, than not deep enough.</P>
<P>When the Orifice has been made, and the Di&s;charge is effected, it is to be dre&s;&s;ed up with the Plai&s;ter No. 66, &s;pread upon Linen, or with the Cerecloth; and the&s;e Dre&s;&s;ings are to be renewed daily.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="012243_0266_0F8A6D74C9ED4668">&sect; 486. When the Whitlow is cau&s;ed by a Humour extrava&s;ated very near the Nail, an expert Surgeon &s;peedily checks its Progre&s;s, and cures it effectually by an Inci&s;ion which lets out the Humour. Yet, notwith&s;tanding this Operation is in no wi&s;e difficult, all Sur|geons are not qualified to perform it, and but too many have no Idea at all of it.</P>
<P>&sect; 487. Fungous, or, as it is commonly called, proud Fle&s;h, &s;ometimes appears during the incarning or healing of the Inci&s;ion. &s;uch may be kept down with &s;prinkling a little <HI>Minium</HI> (red Lead) or burnt Alum over it.</P>
<P>&sect; 488. If a <HI>Caries,</HI> a Rottenne&s;s of the Bone, &s;hould be a Con|&s;equence, there is a Nece&s;&s;ity for a Surgeon's Attendance, as much as if there was a Gangrene; for which Rea&s;on I &s;hall add no|thing with re&s;pect to either of the&s;e Symptoms; only ob&s;erving, there are three very e&s;&s;ential Remedies again&s;t the la&s;t; <HI>viz.</HI> the Bark, No. 14, a Drachm of which mu&s;t be taken every two Hours; Scarifications throughout the whole gangrened Part; and Fomen|tations with a Decoction of the Bark, and the Addition of Spirit of Sulphur. This Medicine is certainly no cheap one; but a De|coction of other bitter Plants, with the Addition of Spirit of Salt, may &s;ometimes do in&s;tead of it. And here I take leave to in&s;i&s;t again upon it, that in mo&s;t Ca&s;es of gangrened Limbs, it is judi|cious not to proceed to an Amputation of the mortified Part, till the Gangrene &s;tops, which may be known by a very perceivable Circle, (and ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by the mo&s;t ignorant Per&s;ons) that marks the Bounds of the Gangrene, and &s;eparates the living from the mortified Parts.</P>

<HEAD>Of Thorns, Splinters, or other pointed Sub&s;tances piercing into the Skin or Fle&s;h.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 489. It is very common for the Hands, Feet or Legs, to be pierced by the forcible Intru&s;ion of &s;mall pointed Sub&s;tances, &s;uch as Thorns or Prickles, whether of Ro&s;es, Thi&s;tles or Che&s;tnuts, or little Splinters of Wood, Bone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>If &s;uch Sub&s;tances are immediately and entirely extracted, the Accident is generally attended with no bad Con&s;equences; though more certainly to obviate any &s;uch, Compre&s;&s;es of Linen dipt in warm Water may be applied to the Part, or it may be kept a little while in a warm Bath. But if any &s;uch pointed penetrating Body cannot be directly extracted, or if a Part of it be left within, it cau&s;es an Inflammation, which, in its Progre&s;s, &s;oon produces the &s;ame Symptoms as a Whitlow: or if it happens in the Leg, it inflames and forms a con&s;iderable Ab&s;ce&s;s there.</P>
<P>&sect; 490. To prevent &s;uch Con&s;equences, if the penetrating Sub|&s;tance is &s;till near the Surface, and an expert Surgeon is at Hand, he mu&s;t immediately make a &s;mall Inci&s;ion, and thence extract it.

Nothing however, but the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Prejudice, could make any one imagine, that this Fat attracted the Splinter, Thorn, or any other obtruded Sub&s;tance by any &s;ympathetic Virtue; no other Sympa|thy in Nature being clearly demon&s;trated, except that very com|mon one between wrong Heads, and ab&s;urd extravagant Opin|ions.</P>
<P>It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the injured Part &s;hould be kept in the ea&s;ie&s;t Po&s;ture, and as immovable as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

Sometimes the Thorn, after having very painfully pene|trated thro' the Teguments, the Skin, enters directly into the Fat; upon which the Pain cea&s;es, and the Patient begins to conclude no &s;harp prickly Sub&s;tance had ever been introduced into the Part; and of cour&s;e &s;uppo&s;es none can remain there.

Of Swoonings.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 494. THERE are many Degrees of Swooning, or fainting away; the &s;lighte&s;t is that in which the Patient con&s;tantly perceives and under&s;tands, yet without the Power of &s;peaking. This is called a Fainting, which happens very often to vapouri&s;h Per&s;ons, and without any remarkable Alteration of the Pul&s;e.</P>
<P>If the Patient entirely lo&s;es Sen&s;ation or Feeling, and Under|&s;tanding, with a very con&s;iderable Sinking of the Pul&s;e, this is called a <HI>Syncop&egrave;,</HI> and is the &s;econd Degree of Swooning.</P>
<P>But if this <HI>Syncop&egrave;</HI> is &s;o violent, that the Pul&s;e &s;eems totally ex|tingui&s;hed; without any di&s;cernible Breathing; with a manife&s;t Coldne&s;s of the whole Body; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> livid Countenance, it con&s;titutes a third and la&s;t Degree, which is the true Image of Death, that in Effect &s;ometimes attends it, and it is called an <HI>A&s;|phixy,</HI> which may &s;ignify a total <HI>Re&s;olution.</HI></P>
<P>Swoonings re&s;ult from many different Cau&s;es, of which I &s;hall only enumerate the principal; and the&s;e are, 1, Too large a Quantity of Blood. 2, A Defect or in&s;ufficient Proportion of it, and a general Weakne&s;s. 3, A Load at and violent Di&s;orders of the Stomach. 4, Nervous Maladies. 5, The Pa&s;&s;ions; and, 6, &s;ome Kinds of Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>Of Swoonings occa&s;ioned by Exce&s;s of Blood.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 495. An exce&s;&s;ive Quantity of Blood is frequently a Cau&s;e of Swooning; and it may be inferred that it is owing to this Cau&s;e, when it attacks &s;anguine, hearty and robu&s;t Per&s;ons; and more e&s;pecially when it attacks them, after being combined with any additional or &s;upervening Cau&s;e, that &s;uddenly increa&s;ed the Motion of the Blood; &s;uch as heating Meats or Drinks, Wine,

&s;pirituous Liquors; &s;maller Drinks, if taken very hot and plenti|fully, &s;uch as Coffee, Indian Tea, Bawm Tea and the like; a long Expo&s;ure to the hot Sun, or being detained in a very hot Place; much and violent Exerci&s;e; over inten&s;e and a&s;&s;iduous Study or Application, or &s;ome exce&s;&s;ive Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In &s;uch Ca&s;es, fir&s;t of all the Patient &s;hould be made to &s;mell to, or even to &s;nuff up, &s;ome Vinegar; and his Forehead, his Temples and his Wri&s;ts &s;hould be bathed with it; adding an equal Quantity of warm Water, if at Hand. Bathing them with di&s;tilled or &s;pirituous Liquors would be prejudicial in this Kind of Swooning.</P>
<P>2, The Patient &s;hould be made, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;wallow two or three Spoonfuls of Vinegar, with four or five times as much Water.</P>
<P>3, The Patient's Garters &s;hould be tied very tightly above his Knees; as by this Means a greater Quantity of Blood is retained in the Legs, whence the Heart may be le&s;s overladen with it.</P>
<P>4, If the Fainting proves ob&s;tinate, that is, if it continues longer than a Quarter of an Hour, or degenerates into a <HI>Syn|cop&egrave;,</HI> an Abolition of Feeling and Under&s;tanding, he mu&s;t be bled in the Arm, which quickly revives him.</P>
<P>5, After the Bleeding the Injection of a Gly&s;ter will be highly proper; and then the Patient &s;hould be kept &s;till and calm, only letting him drink every Half Hour, &s;ome Cups of Elder-flower Tea, with the Addition of a little Sugar and Vinegar.</P>

<P>A light Infu&s;ion of Chamomile Flowers, of Tea, of Sage, of Elder-flowers, or of <HI>Carduus Benedictus,</HI> operate with much the &s;ame Efficacy; though the Chamomile and Carduus promote the Operation of vomiting rather more powerfully; which warm Water alone will &s;ometimes &s;ufficiently do.</P>
<P>The Swooning cea&s;es, or at lea&s;t con&s;iderably abates in the&s;e Ca&s;es, as &s;oon as ever the Vomiting commences. It frequently happens too, that, during the Swooning, Nature her&s;elf brings on a certain <HI>Nau&s;ea,</HI> a Wambling and &s;icki&s;h Commotion of the Stomach, that revives or rou&s;es the Patient for a Moment; but yet not being &s;ufficient to excite an actual Vomiting, it lets him &s;oon &s;ink down again into this temporary Di&s;&s;olution, which often continues a pretty con&s;iderable Time; leaving behind it a Sick|ne&s;s at Stomach, Vertigos, and a Depre&s;&s;ion and Anxiety, which do not occur in the former Species of this Malady.</P>
<P>Whenever the&s;e Swoonings from this Cau&s;e are entirely termi|nated, the Patient mu&s;t be kept for &s;ome Days to a very light Diet, and take, at the &s;ame Time, every Morning fa&s;ting, a Do&s;e
<PB N="253" REF="012243_0273_0F8A6D7E35F051B0">
of the Powder, No. 38, which relieves and exonerates the Sto|mach of whatever noxious Contents might remain in it; and then re&s;tores its natural Strength and Functions.</P>
<P>&sect; 499. There is another Kind of Swooning, which al&s;o re|&s;ults from a Cau&s;e in the Stomach; but which is, neverthele&s;s, very different from this we have ju&s;t been treating of; and which requires a very different Kind of A&s;&s;i&s;tance. It ari&s;es from an extraordinary Sen&s;ibility of this important Organ, and from a general Weakne&s;s of the Patient.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;ubject to this Malady are valetudinary weakly Per&s;ons, who are di&s;ordered from many &s;light Cau&s;es, and who&s;e Stomachs are at once very feeble and extremely &s;en&s;ible. They have almo&s;t continually a little Unea&s;ine&s;s after a Meal, though they &s;hould indulge but a little more than u&s;ual: or if they eat of any Food not quite &s;o ea&s;y of Dige&s;tion, they have &s;ome Quality or Com|motion after it: Nay, &s;hould the Weather only be unfavourable, and &s;ometimes without any perceivable a&s;&s;ignable Cau&s;e, their Unea&s;ine&s;s terminates in a Swoon.</P>
<P>Patients &s;wooning, from the&s;e Cau&s;es, have a greater Nece&s;&s;i|ty for much Tranquillity and Repo&s;e, than for any other Remedy; and it might be &s;ufficient to lay them down on the Bed: But as the By&s;tanders in &s;uch Ca&s;es find it difficult to remain inactive Spectators of Per&s;ons in a Swoon, &s;ome &s;pirituous Liquid may be held to their No&s;e, while their Temples and Wri&s;ts are rubbed with it; and at the &s;ame Time a little Wine &s;hould be given them. Frictions are al&s;o u&s;eful in the&s;e Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>This Species of Swooning is oftener attended with a little Fe|veri&s;hne&s;s than the others.</P>

<HEAD>Of the&s;e Swoonings, which ari&s;e from nervous Di&s;orders.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 500. This Species of Swooning is almo&s;t wholely unknown to tho&s;e Per&s;ons, for whom this Treati&s;e is chiefly intended. Yet as there are &s;ome Citizens who pa&s;s a Part of their Lives in the Country; and &s;ome Country People who are unhappily afflicted with the Ailments of the Inhabitants of large Towns and Cities, it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to treat briefly of them.</P>
<P>By Di&s;orders of the Nerves, I under&s;tand in this Place, only that Fault or Defect in them, which is the Cau&s;e of their exciting in the Body, either irregular Motions, that is, Motions without any external Cau&s;e, at lea&s;t any perceivable one; and without our Will's con&s;enting to the Production of them: or &s;uch Moti|ons, as are greatly more con&s;iderable than they &s;hould be, if they had been proportioned to the Force of the Impre&s;&s;ion from with|out. This is very exactly that State, or Affection termed the <HI>Vapours</HI>; and by the common People, the <HI>Mother</HI>: And as there is no Organ unprovided with Nerves; and none, or hardly any Function, in which the Nerves have not their Influence; it may be ea&s;ily comprehended, that the Vapours being a State or Con|dition,
<PB N="254" REF="012243_0274_0F8A6D7E9E9F5718">
which ari&s;es from the Nerves exerting irregular involun|tary Motions, without any evident Cau&s;e; and all the Functions of the Body depending partly on the Nerves; there is no one Symptom of other Di&s;ea&s;es which the Vapours may not produce or imitate; and that the&s;e Symptoms, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, mu&s;t vary infinitely, according to tho&s;e Branches of the Nerves which are di&s;ordered. It may al&s;o hence be conceived, why the Vapours of one Per&s;on have frequently no Re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of another: and why the Vapours of the very &s;ame Per&s;on, in one Day, are &s;o very different from tho&s;e of the next. It is al&s;o very conceiva|ble that the Vapours are a certain, a real Malady; and that Oddi|ty of the Symptoms, which cannot be accounted for, by People unacquainted with the animal Oeconomy, has been the Cau&s;e of their being con&s;idered rather as the Effect of a depraved Imagi|nation, than as a real Di&s;ea&s;e. It is very conceivable, I &s;ay, that this &s;urprizing Oddity of the Symptoms is a nece&s;&s;ary Effect of the Cau&s;e of the Vapours; and that no Per&s;on can any more prevent his being invaded by the Vapours, than he can prevent the At|tack of a Fever, or of the Tooth-ach.</P>
<P>&sect; 501. A few plain In&s;tances will furni&s;h out a more compleat Notion of the Mechani&s;m, or Nature, of Vapours. An Emetic, a vomiting Medicine, excites the Act, or rather the Pa&s;&s;ion, the Convul&s;ion of Vomiting, chiefly by the Irritation it gives to the Nerves of the Stomach; which Irritation produces a Spa&s;m, a Contraction of this Organ. Now if in Con&s;equence of this mor|bid or defective Texture of the Nerves, which con&s;titutes the Va|pours, tho&s;e of the Stomach are excited to act with the &s;ame Vio|lence, as in Con&s;equence of taking a Vomit, the Patient will be agitated and worked by violent Efforts to vomit, as much as if he had really taken one.</P>
<P>If an involuntary unu&s;ual Motion in the Nerves, that are di&s;tri|buted through the Lungs, &s;hould con&s;train and &s;traiten the very little Ve&s;icles, or Bladders, as it were, which admit the fre&s;h Air at every Re&s;piration, the Patient will feel a Degree of Suffo|cation; ju&s;t as if that Straitening or Contraction of the Ve&s;&s;els were occa&s;ioned by &s;ome noxious Steam or Vapour.</P>
<P>Should the Nerves which are di&s;tributed throughout the whole Skin, by a Succe&s;&s;ion of the&s;e irregular morbid Motions, contract them&s;elves, as they may from external Cold, or by &s;ome &s;timulat|ing Application, Per&s;piration by the Pores will be prevented or checked; whence the Humours, which &s;hould be evacuated through the Pores of the Skin, will be thrown upon the Kidnies, and the Patient will make a great Quantity of thin clear Urine, a Symptom very common to vapouri&s;h People; or it may be divert|ed to the Glands of the Inte&s;tines, the Guts, and terminates in a watery <HI>Diarrhaea,</HI> or Loo&s;ene&s;s, which frequently proves a very ob&s;tinate one.</P>
<P>&sect; 502. Neither are Swoonings the lea&s;t u&s;ual Symptoms at|tending the Vapours; and we may be certain they &s;pring from
<PB N="255" REF="012243_0275_0F8A6D7F4EA7A1F8">
this Source, when they happen to a Per&s;on &s;ubject to the Vapours; and none of the other Cau&s;es producing them are evident, or have lately preceded them.</P>
<P>Such Swoonings, however, are indeed very rarely dangerous, and &s;carcely require any medical A&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Patient &s;hould be laid upon a Bed; the fre&s;h Air &s;hould he very freely admitted to him; and he &s;hould be made to &s;mell rather to &s;ome di&s;a|greeable and fetid, than to any fragrant Sub&s;tance. It is in &s;uch Faintings as the&s;e that the Smell of burnt Leather, of Feathers, or of Paper, have often proved of great Service.</P>
<P>&sect; 503. Patients al&s;o frequently faint away, in Con&s;equence of fa&s;ting too long: or from having eat a little too much; from be|ing confined in too hot a Chamber; from having &s;een too much Company; from &s;melling too over-powering a Scent; from being too co&s;tive; from being too forcibly affected with &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e or Sentiments; and, in a Word from a great Variety of Cau&s;es, which might not make the lea&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion on Per&s;ons in perfect Health; but which violently operate upon tho&s;e vapouri&s;h People, becau&s;e, as I have &s;aid, the Fault of their Nerves con&s;i&s;ts in their being too vividly, too acutely affected; the Force of their Sen&s;a|tion being nowi&s;e proportioned to the external Cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as that particular Cau&s;e is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the re&s;t, which has occa&s;ioned the pre&s;ent Swooning; it is manife&s;t that this Swooning is to be remedied, by removing that particu|lar Cau&s;e of it.</P>

<HEAD>Of Swoonings occa&s;ioned by the Pa&s;&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 504. There have been &s;ome In&s;tances of Per&s;ons dying within a Moment, through exce&s;&s;ive Joy. But &s;uch In&s;tances are &s;o very rare and &s;udden, that A&s;&s;i&s;tance has &s;eldom been &s;ought for on this Occa&s;ion. The Ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e with re&s;pect to tho&s;e produced from Rage, Vexation, and Dread or Horror. I &s;hall treat in a &s;eparate Article of tho&s;e re&s;ulting from great Fear; and &s;hall briefly con&s;ider here &s;uch as en&s;ue from Rage, and vehe|ment Grief or Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>&sect; 505. Exce&s;&s;ive Rage and violent Affliction are &s;ometimes fatal in the Twinkling of an Eye; though they oftner terminate in fainting only. Exce&s;&s;ive Grief or Chagrin is e&s;pecially accom|panied with this Con&s;equence; and it is very common to &s;ee Per|&s;ons thus affected, &s;ink into &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Faintings for &s;everal Hours. It is plainly obvious that very little Affiance can be given in &s;uch Ca&s;es: it is proper, however, they &s;hould &s;mell to &s;trong Vinegar; and frequently take a few Cups of &s;ome hot and temperately cor|dial Drink, &s;uch as Bawn-Tea, or Lemonade with a little Orange or Lemon-peel.</P>
<P>The calming, a&s;&s;waging Cordial, that has &s;eemed the mo&s;t effi|cacious to me, is one &s;mall Coffee Spoonful of a Mixture of three

<P>It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that Swoonings or Faintings, from ex|ce&s;&s;ive Pa&s;&s;ions, can be cured by Nouri&s;hment. The phy&s;ical State or Condition, into which vehement Grief throws the Body, is that, of all others, in which Nouri&s;hment would be mo&s;t injuri|ous to it: and as long as the Vehemence of the Affliction endures, the Sufferer &s;hould take nothing but &s;ome Spoonfuls of Soup or Broth, or a few Mor&s;els of &s;ome light Meat roa&s;ted.</P>
<P>&sect; 506. When Wrath or Rage has ri&s;en to &s;o high a Pitch, that the human Machine, the Body, entirely exhau&s;ted, as it were, by that violent Effort, &s;inks down at once into exce&s;&s;ive Relaxation, a Fainting &s;ometimes &s;ucceeds, and even the mo&s;t perilous Degree of it, a <HI>Syncop&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;ufficient, or rather the mo&s;t that can be done here, to let the Patient be perfectly &s;till a while in this State; only making him &s;mell to &s;ome Vinegar. But when he is come to him&s;elf, he &s;hould drink plentifully of hot Lemonade, and take one or more of the Gly&s;ters No. 5.</P>
<P>Sometimes there remain in the&s;e Ca&s;es Sickne&s;&s;es at Stomach, Reachings to vomit, a Bitterne&s;s in the Mouth, and &s;ome verti|ginous Symptoms which &s;eem to require a Vomit. But &s;uch a Medicine mu&s;t be very carefully avoided, &s;ince it may be attended with the mo&s;t fatal Con&s;equence: and Lemonade with Gly&s;ters generally and gradually remove the&s;e Swoonings. If the <HI>Nau&s;ea</HI> and Sickne&s;s at Stomach continue, the utmo&s;t Medicine we &s;hould allow be&s;ides, would be that of No. 23, or a few Do&s;es of No. 24.</P>

<P>&sect; 509. Tho&s;e who have any inward Ab&s;ce&s;s or Impo&s;thume are apt to &s;woon frequently. They may &s;ometimes be revived a little by Vinegar, but they prove too frequently mortal.</P>
<P>&sect; 510. Many Per&s;ons have a &s;lighter or a deeper Swooning, at the End of a violent Fit of an intermitting Fever, or at that of each Exacerbation of a continual Fever; this con&s;tantly &s;hews the Fever has run very high, the Swooning having been the Con|&s;equence of that great Relaxation, which has &s;ucceeded to a very high Ten&s;ion.

<HEAD>Of Haemorrhages, or an involuntary Lo&s;s of Blood.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 512. Haemorrhages of the No&s;e, &s;upervening in inflamma|tory Fevers, commonly prove a favourable <HI>Cri&s;is</HI>; which Bleed|ing we &s;hould carefully avoid &s;topping; except it becomes exce&s;|&s;ive, and &s;eems to threaten the Patient's Life.</P>
<P>As they &s;carcely ever happen in very healthy Subjects, but from a &s;uperfluous Abundance of Blood, it is very improper to check them too &s;oon; le&s;t &s;ome internal Stuffings and Ob&s;tructions &s;hould prove the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>A Swooning &s;ometimes en&s;ues after the Lo&s;s of only a moderate Quantity of Blood. This Swooning &s;tops the Haemorrhage, and goes off without any further A&s;&s;i&s;tance, except the Smelling to Vinegar. But in other Ca&s;es there is a Succe&s;&s;ion of fainting Fits, without the Blood's &s;topping; while at the &s;ame time &s;light convul&s;ive Motions and Twitchings en&s;ue, attended with a Rav|ing, when it becomes really nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top the Bleeding: and indeed, without waiting till the&s;e violent Symptoms appear, the

following Signs will &s;ufficiently direct us, when it is right to &s;top the Flux of Blood, or to permit its Continuance&mdash;As long as the Pul&s;e is &s;till pretty full; while the Heat of the Body is equally extended to the very Extremities; and the Countenance and Lips pre&s;erve their natural Redne&s;s, no ill Con&s;equence is to be ap|prehended from the Haemorrhage, though it has been very copi|ous, and even &s;omewhat profu&s;e.</P>
<P>But whenever the Pul&s;e begins to faulter and tremble; when the Countenance and the Lips grow pale, and the Patient com|plains of a &s;ickne&s;s at Stomach, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top the Di&s;charge of Blood. And con&s;idering that the Operation of Remedies does not immediately follow the Exhibition or Applica|tion of them, it is &s;afer to begin a little too early with them, than to delay them, though ever &s;o little too long.</P>
<P>&sect; 513. Fir&s;t of all then, tight Bandages, or Ligatures, &s;hould be applied round both Arms, on the Part they are applied over in order to Bleeding; and round the lower Part of both Thighs, on the gartering Place; and all the&s;e are to be drawn very tight, with on Intention to detain and accumulate the Blood in the Ex|tremities.</P>
<P>2, In order to increa&s;e this Effect, the Legs are to be plunged in warm Water up to the Knees; for by relaxing the Blood ve&s;&s;els of the Legs and Feet, they are dilated at the &s;ame time, and thence receive, and, in Con&s;equence of the Ligatures above the Knees, retain the more Blood. If the Water were cold, it would repel the Blood to the Head; if hot, it would increa&s;e the Motion of it; and, by giving a greater Quickne&s;s to the Pul&s;e, would even contribute to increa&s;e the Haemorrhage.</P>
<P>As &s;oon however, as the Haemorrhage is &s;topt, the&s;e Ligatures [on the Thighs] may be relaxed a little, or one of them be en|tirely removed; allowing the others to continue on an Hour or two without touching them: but great Precaution &s;hould be taken not to &s;lacken them entirely, nor all at once.</P>
<P>3, Seven or eight Grains of Nitre, and a Spoonful of Vinegar in half a Gla&s;s of cool Water, &s;hould be given to the Patient every half Hour.</P>
<P>4. One Drachm of white Vitriol mu&s;t be di&s;&s;olved in two com|mon Spoonfuls of Spring Water; and a Tent of Lint, or Bits of &s;oft fine Linen Dipt in this Solution, are to be introduced into the No&s;trils, horizontally at fir&s;t, but afterwards to be intruded up|wards, and as high as may be, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a flexible Bit of Wood or Whalebone. But &s;hould this Application be ineffectual, the Mineral Anodyne Liquor of HOFFMAN is certain to &s;ucceed: and in the Country, where it often happens that neither of the&s;e Applications are to be had &s;peedily, Brandy, and even Spirit of Wine, mixt with a third Part Vinegar, have an&s;wered entirely well, of which I have been a Witne&s;s.</P>

<P>As this terrible Di&s;ea&s;e is common in the Country, it is doing a real Service to the unfortunate Victims of it, to inform them how very dangerous it is to give them&s;elves blindly up to take all the Medicines, which are cried up to them in &s;uch Ca&s;es. If there be any one Di&s;ea&s;e, which requires a more attentive, delicate and exqui&s;ite Kind of Treatment, it is this very Di&s;ea&s;e. Some Spe|cies of it are wholly incurable: and &s;uch as may be &s;u&s;ceptible of a Cure, require the utmo&s;t Care and Con&s;ideration of the mo&s;t enlightened and mo&s;t experienced Phy&s;icians: while tho&s;e who pretend to cure all epileptic Patients with one invariable Me|dicine, are either Ignorants, or Impo&s;tors, and &s;ometimes both in one.</P>
<P>&sect; 517. Simple Convul&s;ion Fits, which are not epileptic, are frequently of a long Continuance, per&s;evering, with very few and &s;hort Intervals, for Days and even for Weeks.</P>
<P>The true genuine Cau&s;e &s;hould be inve&s;tigated as &s;trictly as po&s;|&s;ible, though nothing &s;hould be attempted in the Fit. The Nerves are, during that Term, in &s;o high a Degree of Ten&s;ion and Sen|&s;ibility, that the very Medicines, &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;trongly indicat|ed, often redouble the Storm they were intended to appea&s;e.</P>
<P>Thin watery Liquors, moderately imbued with Aromatics, are the lea&s;t hurtful, and the mo&s;t innocent Things that can be given; &s;uch as Bawm, Lime-tree, and Elder-flower Tea. A Pti&s;an of Liquorice Root only has &s;ometimes an&s;wered better than any other.</P>

<HEAD>Of &s;uffocating or &s;trangling Fits.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 518. The&s;e Fits (by whatever other Name they may be called) whenever they very &s;uddenly attack a Per&s;on, who&s;e Breathing was ea&s;y and natural ju&s;t before, depend almo&s;t con&s;tantly on a Spa&s;m or Contraction of the Nerves, in the Ve&s;icles of the Lungs; or upon an Infarction, a Stuffing of the &s;ame Parts, produced by vi&s;cid clammy Humours.</P>
<P>That Suffocation which ari&s;es from a Spa&s;m is not dangerous, it goes off of it&s;elf, or it may be treated like Swoonings owing to the &s;ame Cau&s;e. See &sect; 502.</P>
<P>&sect; 519. The Suffocation, which is the Effect of a &s;anguineous Fulne&s;s and Ob&s;truction, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by its attacking &s;trong, vigorous, &s;anguine Per&s;ons, who are great Eaters, u&s;ing much juicy nutritious Food, and &s;trong Wine and Liquors, and who frequently eat and inflame them&s;elves; and when the Fit has

come on after any inflaming Cau&s;e; when the Pul&s;e is full and &s;trong, and the Countenance red.</P>
<P>Such are cured, 1, by a very plentiful Di&s;charge of Blood from the Arm, which is to be repeated if nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>2, By the U&s;e of Gly&s;ters.</P>
<P>3, By drinking plentifully of the Pti&s;an No. 1; to each Pot of which, a Drachm of Nitre is to be added; and,</P>
<P>4, By the Vapour of hot Vinegar, continually received by Re&s;|&s;piration or Breathing. See &sect; 55.</P>
<P>&sect; 520. There is Rea&s;on to think that one of the&s;e Fits is owing to a Quantity of tough vi&s;cid Humours in the Lungs, when it at|tacks Per&s;ons, who&s;e Temperament, and who&s;e Manner of living are oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e I have ju&s;t de&s;cribed; &s;uch as valetudinary, weakly, phlegmatick, pituitous, inactive, and &s;queami&s;h Per&s;ons, who feed badly, or on fat, vi&s;cid, and in&s;ipid Diet, and who drink much hot Water, either alone, or in Tea-like Infu&s;ions. And the&s;e Signs of Suffocation, re&s;ulting from &s;uch Cau&s;es, are &s;till more probable, if the Fit came on in rainy Weather, and during a &s;outherly Wind; and when the Pul&s;e is &s;oft and &s;mall, the Vi&s;age Pale and hollow.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t efficacious Treatment we can advi&s;e, is, 1, To give every half Hour half a Cup of the Potion, No. 8, if it can readi|ly be had. 2, To make the Patient drink very plentifully of the Drink No. 12; and 3, to apply two &s;trong Bli&s;ters to the fle&s;hy Parts of his Legs.</P>
<P>If he was &s;trong and hearty before the Fit, and the Pul&s;e &s;till continues vigorous, and feels &s;omewhat full withal, the lo&s;s of &s;even or eight Ounces of Blood is &s;ometimes indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;a|ry. A Gly&s;ter has al&s;o frequently been attended with extraordina|ry good Effects.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e afflicted with this oppre&s;&s;ing Malady are commonly re|lieved, as &s;oon as they expectorate, and &s;ometimes even by vo|miting a little.</P>
<P>The Medicine No. 25, a Do&s;e of which may be taken every two Hours, with a Cup of the Pti&s;an No. 12, often &s;ucceeds very well.</P>
<P>But if neither this Medicine, nor the Pre&s;cription No. 8 are at Hand, which may be the Ca&s;e in Country Places; an Onion of a moderate Size &s;hould be pounded in an Iron or Marble Mortar; upon this, a Gla&s;s of Vinegar is to be poured, and then &s;trongly &s;queezed out again through a Piece of Linen. An equal Quan|tity of Honey is then to be added to it. A Spoonful of this Mix|ture, who&s;e remarkable Efficacy I have been a Witne&s;s of, is to be given every half Hour.</P>

<HEAD>Of the violent Effects of Fear.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 521. Here I &s;hall in&s;ert &s;ome Directions to prevent the ill Con&s;equences of great Fear or Terror, which are very prejudi|cial at every Term of Life, but chiefly during Infancy.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="012243_0282_0F8A6D86D553DE90">The general Effects of Terror are a great Straitening and Con|traction of all the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, and a Repul&s;ion of the Blood in|to the large and internal ones. Hence follows the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Per&s;piration, the general Seizure or Oppre&s;&s;ion, the Trembling, the Palpitations and Angui&s;h, from the Heart and the Lungs be|ing overcharged with Blood; and &s;ometimes attended with Swoonings, irremediable Di&s;orders of the Heart, and Death it|&s;elf: A heavy Drow&s;ine&s;s, Raving, and a Kind of furious or raging <HI>Delirium</HI> happen in other Ca&s;es, which I have frequently ob&s;erved in Children, when the Blood Ve&s;&s;els of the Neck were &s;welled or &s;tuffed up; and Convul&s;ions, and even the Epilep&s;ey have come on, all which have proved the horrible Con&s;equence of a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s and wicked Foolery or Sporting. One half of tho&s;e Epilep&s;ies which do not depend on &s;uch Cau&s;es as might ex|i&s;t before the Child's Birth, are owing to this dete&s;table Cu&s;tom; and it cannot be too much inculcated into Children, never to frighten one another; a Point which Per&s;ons, intru&s;ted with their Education, ought to have the &s;tricte&s;t Regard to.</P>
<P>When the Humours that &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed off by Per&s;piration, are repelled to the Inte&s;tines, a tedious and very ob&s;tinate Loo&s;e|ne&s;s is the frequent Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>&sect; 522. Our Endeavours &s;hould be directed, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the di&s;ordered Circulation; to re&s;tore the ob&s;tructed Per&s;piration; and to allay the Agitation of the Nerves.</P>
<P>The popular Cu&s;tom in the&s;e Ca&s;es has been to give the terri|fied Patient &s;ome cold Water directly; but when the Fright has been con&s;iderable, this is a very pernicious Cu&s;tom, and I have &s;een &s;ome terrible Con&s;equences from it.</P>
<P>They &s;hould, on the contrary, be conveyed into &s;ome very qui|et Situation, leaving there but very few Per&s;ons, and &s;uch only as they are thoroughly familiar with. They &s;hould take a few Cups of pretty warm Drink, particularly of an Infu&s;ion of Lime-tree Flowers and Bawm. Their Legs &s;hould be put into warm Water, and remain there an Hour, if they will patiently permit it, rubbing them gently now and then, and giving them every half-quarter of an Hour, a &s;mall Cup of the &s;ame Drink. When their Com|po&s;ure and Tranquillity are returned a little, and their Skin &s;eems to have recovered its wonted and general Warmth, Care &s;hould be taken to di&s;po&s;e them to Sleep, and to per&s;pire plentifully. For this Purpo&s;e they may be allowed a few Spoonfuls of Wine, on putting them into Bed, with one Cup of the former Infu&s;ion; or, which is more certain and effectual, a few Drops of SYDEN|HAM's Liquid Laudanum, No. 4; but &s;hould not that be near at hand, a &s;mall Do&s;e of <HI>Venice</HI> Treacle.</P>
<P>&sect; 523. It &s;ometimes happens that Children do not &s;eem at fir&s;t extremely terrified ; but the Fright is renewed while they &s;leep, and with no &s;mall Violence. The Directions I have ju&s;t given
<PB N="263" REF="012243_0283_0F8A6D88D920FBC0">
mu&s;t then be ob&s;erved, for &s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Evenings before they are put to Bed.</P>
<P>Their Fright frequently returns about the latter End of the Night, and agitates them violently every Day. The &s;ame Treat|ment &s;hould be continued in &s;uch Ca&s;es; and we &s;hould endea|vour to di&s;po&s;e them to be a&s;leep at the u&s;ual Hour of its Return.</P>
<P>By this very Method I have di&s;&s;ipated the di&s;mal Con&s;equences of Fear on Women in Childbed, which is &s;o commonly, and often &s;peedily, mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l.</P>
<P>If a Suffocation from this Cau&s;e is violent, there is &s;ometimes a Nece&s;&s;ity for opening a Vein in the Arm.</P>
<P>The&s;e Patients &s;hould gradually be inured to an almo&s;t conti|nual, but gentle, Kind of Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>All violent Medicines render tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, which are the Con&s;equences of great Fear, incurable. A pretty common one is that of an Ob&s;truction of the Liver, which has been productive of a Jaundice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have &s;een this actually verified by great and di&s;agreeable Surprize, attend|ed indeed with much Concern, in a Per&s;on of exqui&s;ite Sen&s;ations. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>Of Accidents or Symptoms produced by the Vapours of Coal, and of Wine.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 524. Not a &s;ingle Year pa&s;&s;es over here, without the De|&s;truction of many People by the Vapour of Charcoal, or of &s;mall Coal, and by the Steam or Vapour of Wine.</P>
<P>The Symptoms by Coal occur, when <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>La Brai&s;e.</HI></NOTE> &s;mall Coal, and e&s;peci|ally when <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Charbon.</HI> Dr. TISSOT informs me, their Difference con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the Charcoal is prepared from Wood burnt in a clo&s;e or &s;tifled Fire; and that the &s;mall Coal is made of Wood (and of &s;maller Wood) burnt in an open Fire, and extingui&s;hed before it is reduced to the State of a Cinder. He &s;ays the latter is &s;maller, &s;ofter, le&s;s durable in the Fire, and the Vapour of it le&s;s dangerous than that of Charcoal.</NOTE> Charcoal is burnt in a Chamber clo&s;e &s;hut, which is direct Poi&s;on to a Per&s;on &s;hut up in it. The &s;ulphureous Oil, which is &s;et at Liberty and diffu&s;ed by the Action of Fire, expands it&s;elf through the Chamber; while tho&s;e who are in it perceive a Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion in their Heads; they contract Virtigos, Sickne&s;s at Stomach, a Weakne&s;s, and very unu&s;ual Kind of Numb|ne&s;s; become raving, convul&s;ed and trembling, and if they fail of Pre&s;ence of Mind, or of Strength, to get out of the Chamber, they die within a &s;hort Time.</P>
<P>I have &s;een a Woman who had vertiginous Commotions in her Head for two Days, and almo&s;t continual Vomitings, from her having been confined le&s;s than &s;ix Minutes in a Chamber (and that notwith&s;tanding both one Window and one Door were open) in
<PB N="264" REF="012243_0284_0F8A6D89450606A8">
which there was a Chafingdi&s;h with &s;ome burning Coals. Had the Room been quite clo&s;e, &s;he mu&s;t have peri&s;hed by it.</P>
<P>This Vapour is narcotic or &s;tupefyi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and proves mortal in Con&s;equence of its producing a &s;leepy or apoplectic Di&s;order, though blended, at the &s;ame time, with &s;omething convul&s;ive; which &s;ufficiently appears from the Clo&s;ure of the Mouth, and the &s;trict Contraction or Locking of the Jaws.</P>
<P>The Condition of the Brain, in the di&s;&s;ected Bodies of Per&s;ons thus de&s;troyed, proves that they die of an Apoplexy; notwi&s;tand|ing it is very probable that Suffocation is al&s;o partly the Cau&s;e of their Deaths; as the Lungs have been found &s;tuffed up with Blood and livid.</P>
<P>It has al&s;o been ob&s;erved in &s;ome other Bodies thus de&s;troyed, that Patients killed by the Vapour of burning Coals, have com|monly their whole Bodies &s;welled out to one third more than their Magnitude, when living. The Face, Neck, and Arms are &s;well|ed, as if they had been blown up; and the whole human Machine appears in &s;uch a State, as the dead Body of a Per&s;on would, who had been violently &s;trangled; and who had made all po&s;&s;ible Re|&s;i&s;tance for a long time, before he was overpowered.</P>
<P>&sect; 525. Such as are &s;en&s;ible of the great Danger they are in, and retreat &s;ea&s;onably from it, are generally relieved as &s;oon as they get out into the open Air; or if they have any remaining Unea&s;ine&s;s, a little Water and Vinegar, or Lemonade, drank hot, affords them &s;peedy Relief. But when they are &s;o far poi&s;oned, as to have lo&s;t their Feeling and Under&s;tanding, if there be any Means of reviving them, &s;uch Means con&s;i&s;t,</P>
<P>1, In expo&s;ing them to a very pure, fre&s;h and open Air.</P>
<P>2, In making them &s;mell to &s;ome very penetrating Odour, which is &s;omewhat &s;timulating and reviving, &s;uch as the volatile Spirit of Sal Ammoniac, the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Note * Page 251.</NOTE> <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Salt; and afterwards to &s;urround them, as it were, with the Steam of Vinegar.</P>
<P>3, In taking &s;ome Blood from their Arm.</P>
<P>4, In putting their Legs into warm or hot Water, and cha&s;ing them well.</P>
<P>5, In making them &s;wallow, if practicable, much Lemonade, or Water and Vinegar, with the Addition of Nitre: and,</P>
<P>6, In throwing up &s;ome &s;harp Gly&s;ters.</P>
<P>As it is manife&s;t there is &s;omething &s;pa&s;modic in the&s;e Ca&s;es, it were proper to be provided with &s;ome anti&s;pa&s;modic Remedies, &s;uch as the Mineral Anodyne Liquid of HOFFMAN. Even Opi|um has &s;ometimes been &s;ucce&s;sfully given here, but it &s;hould be al|lowed to Phy&s;icians only to direct it in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>A Vomit would be hurtful; and the Reachings to vomit ari&s;e only from the Oppre&s;&s;ion on the Brain.</P>
<P>It is a common but erroneous Opinion, that if the Coal be &s;uf|fered
<PB N="265" REF="012243_0285_0F8A6D89F5A7E6A0">
to burn a Minute or &s;o in the open Air or in a Chimney, it is &s;ufficient to prevent any Danger from the Vapour of it.</P>
<P>Hence it amounts even to a criminal Degree of Imprudence, to &s;leep in a Chamber while Charcoal or &s;mall Coal is burning in it; and the Number of &s;uch imprudent Per&s;ons, as have never awaked after it, is &s;o con&s;iderable, and &s;o generally known too, that the Continuance of this unhappy Cu&s;tom is a&s;toni&s;hing.</P>
<P>&sect; 526. The Bakers, who make u&s;e of much &s;mall Coal, often keep great Quantities of it in their Cellars, which frequently abound &s;o much with the Vapour of it, that it &s;eizes them vio|lently the Moment they enter into the Cellar. They &s;ink down at once, deprived of all Sen&s;ation, and die if they are not drawn out of it &s;oon enough to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, according to the Directions I have ju&s;t given.</P>
<P>One certain Means of preventing &s;uch fatal Accidents, is, up|on going into the Cellar, to throw &s;ome flaming Paper or Straw into it, and if the&s;e continue to flame out and con&s;ume, there is no Rea&s;on for dreading the Vapour: but if they &s;hould be extin|gui&s;hed, no Per&s;on ought to venture in. But after opening the Vent-hole, a Bundle of flaming Straw mu&s;t be &s;et at the Door, which &s;erves to attract the external Air &s;trongly. Soon after the Experiment of the flaming Paper mu&s;t be repeated, and if it goes out, more Straw is to be &s;et on Fire before the Cellar Door.</P>
<P>&sect; 527. Small Coal, burnt in an open Fire, is not near &s;o dan|gerous as <HI>Charcoal,</HI> properly &s;o called, the Danger of which a|ri&s;es from this, that in extingui&s;hing it by the u&s;ual Methods, all tho&s;e &s;ulphureous Particles of it, in which its Danger con&s;i&s;t, are concentred. Neverthele&s;s, &s;mall Coal is not entirely deprived of all its noxious Quality, without &s;ome of which it could not &s;trictly be Coal.</P>
<P>The common Method of throwing &s;ome Salt on live Coals, be|fore they are conveyed into a Chamber: or of ca&s;ting a Piece of Iron among them, to imbibe &s;ome Part of their deadly narcotic Sulphur, is not without its Utility; though by no Means &s;ufficient to prevent all Danger from them.</P>
<P>&sect; 528. When the mo&s;t dangerous Symptoms from this Cau&s;e di&s;appear, and there remains only &s;ome Degree of Weakne&s;s, of Numbne&s;s, and a little Inappetency, or Loathing at Stomach, nothing is better than Lemonade with one fourth Part Wine, half a Cup of which &s;hould frequently be taken with a &s;mall Cru&s;t of Bread.</P>
<P>&sect; 529. The Vapour which exhales from Wine, and in general from all fermenting Liquors, &s;uch as Beer, Cyder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contains &s;omething poi&s;onous, which kills in the like Manner, with the Va|pour of Coal; and there is always &s;ome Danger in going into a Cellar, where there is much Wine in the State of Fermentation; if it has been &s;hut up clo&s;e for &s;everal Hours. There have been many Examples of Per&s;ons &s;truck dead on entering one, and of others who have e&s;caped out of it with Difficulty.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="012243_0286_0F8A6D8A896CE720">When &s;uch unhappy Accidents occur, Men &s;hould not be &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively expo&s;ed, one after another, to peri&s;h, by endeavouring to fetch out the fir&s;t who &s;unk down upon his Entrance; but the Air &s;hould immediately be purified by the Method already directed, or by di&s;charging &s;ome Guns into the Cellar; after which People may venture in with Precaution. And when the Per&s;ons unfortu|nately afflicted are brought out, they are to be treated like tho&s;e, who were affected with the Coal-Vapour.</P>
<P>I &s;aw a Man about eight Years &s;ince, who was not &s;en&s;ible of the Application of Spirit of Sal Ammoniac, till about an Hour after he was &s;truck down, and who was entirely freed at la&s;t by a plenti|ful Bleeding; though he had been &s;o in&s;en&s;ible, that it was &s;eve|ral Hours before he di&s;covered a very great Wound he had, which extended from the Middle of his Arm to his Arm-pit; and which was made by a Hook intended to be u&s;ed, in Ca&s;e of a Hou&s;e catching Fire, to a&s;&s;i&s;t Per&s;ons in e&s;caping from the Flames.</P>
<P>&sect; 530. When &s;ubterraneous Caves that have been very long &s;hut are opened; or when deep Wells are cleaned, that have not been emptied for &s;everal Years, the Vapours ari&s;ing from them produce the &s;ame Symptoms I have mentioned, and require the &s;ame A&s;&s;i&s;tance. They are to be clean&s;ed and purified by burning Sulphur and Salt Petre in them, or Gunpowder, as compounded of both.</P>
<P>&sect; 531. The offen&s;ive Stink of Lamps and of Candles, e&s;peci|ally when their Flames are extingui&s;hed, operate like other Va|pours, though with le&s;s Violence, and le&s;s &s;uddenly. Neverthe|le&s;s there have been In&s;tances of People killed by the Fumes of Lamps fed with Nut Oil, which had been extingui&s;hed in a clo&s;e Room. The&s;e la&s;t Smells or Fumes prove noxious al&s;o, in Con|&s;equence of their Grea&s;ine&s;s, which being conveyed, together with the Air, into the Lungs, prevent their Re&s;piration: And hence we may ob&s;erve, that Per&s;ons of weak delicate Brea&s;ts find them|&s;elves quickly oppre&s;&s;ed in Chambers or Apartments, illuminated with many Candles.</P>

<P>&sect; 532. There are a great Number of Poi&s;ons, who&s;e Manner of acting is not alike; and who&s;e ill Effects are to be oppo&s;ed by different Remedies: but Ar&s;enic, or Rat&s;bane, and &s;ome particu|lar Plants are the Poi&s;ons which are the mo&s;t frequently produc|tive of Mi&s;chief in Country Places.</P>

Guts; with rending and often bloody Vomitings and Stools, Convul&s;ions, Faintings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The be&s;t Remedy of all is pouring down whole Torrents of Milk or, where there is not Milk, of warm Water. Nothing but a prodigious Quantity of &s;uch weak Liquids can avail &s;uch a mi&s;e|rable Patient. If the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;order is immediately known, after having very &s;peedily taken down a large Quantity of warm Water, Vomiting may be excited with Oil, or with melted But|ter, and by tickling the In&s;ide of the Throat with a Feather. But when the Poi&s;on has already inflamed the Stomach and the Guts, we mu&s;t not expect to di&s;charge it by vomiting. Whatever is healing or emollient, Decoctions of mealy Puls, of Barley, of Oatmeal, of Mar&s;hmallows, and Butter and Oil are the mo&s;t &s;uit|able.</P>

<P>And even though it &s;hould happen that a Patient overcomes the fir&s;t Violence of this dreadful Accident, it is too common for him to continue in a languid State for a long Time, and &s;ometimes for all the Remainder of his Life.

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXII. Of Medicinces taken by Way of Precaution, or Prevention.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 538. I HAVE pointed out, in &s;ome Parts of this Work, the Means of preventing the bad Effects of &s;everal Cau&s;es of Di&s;ea&s;es; and of prohibiting the Return of &s;ome habitual Di&s;orders. In the pre&s;ent Chapter I &s;hall adjoin &s;ome Ob&s;ervations, on the U&s;e of the principal Remedies, which are employed as general Pre&s;erva|tives; pretty regularly too at certain &s;tated Times, and almo&s;t always from meer Cu&s;tom only, without knowing, and often with very little Con&s;ideration, whether they are right or wrong.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the U&s;e, the Habit of taking Medicines, is cer|tainly no indifferent Matter: it is ridiculous, dangerous, and even criminal to omit them, when they are nece&s;&s;ary, but not le&s;s &s;o to take them when they are not wanted. A good Medicine taken &s;ea&s;onably, when there is &s;ome Di&s;order, &s;ome <HI>Di&s;arrangement</HI> in the Body, which would in a &s;hort time occa&s;ion a Di&s;temper, has often prevented it. But yet the very &s;ame Medicine, when given to a Per&s;on in perfect Health, if it does not directly make him &s;ick, leaves him at the be&s;t in a greater Propen&s;ity to the Im|pre&s;&s;ions of Di&s;ea&s;es: and there are but too many Examples of People, who having very unhappily contracted a Habit, a Di&s;po&s;i|tion to take Phy&s;ick, have really injured their Health, and im|paired their Con&s;titutions, however naturally &s;trong, by an Abu&s;e of tho&s;e Materials, which Providence has given for the Recovery and Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of it: an Abu&s;e which, though it &s;hould not injure the Health of the Per&s;on, would occa&s;ion tho&s;e Reme|dies, when he &s;hould be really &s;ick, to be le&s;s efficacious and &s;er|viceable to him, from their having been familiar to his Con&s;tituti|on; ond thus he becomes deprived of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he would have received from them, if taken only in tho&s;e Times and Circum|&s;tances, in which they were nece&s;&s;ary for him.</P>

<HEAD>Of Bleeding.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 539. Bleeding is nece&s;&s;ary only in the&s;e four Ca&s;es. 1, When there is too great a (Quantity of Blood in the Body. 2, When there is any Inflammation, or an inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;e. 3, When &s;ome Cau&s;e &s;upervenes or is about to &s;upervene, in the Con&s;titu|tion, which would &s;peedily produce an Inflammation, or &s;ome
<PB N="270" REF="012243_0290_0F8A6D8D89B8F3E0">
other dangerous Symptoms, if the Ve&s;&s;els were not relaxed by Bleeding. It is upon this Principle that Patients are bled after Wounds, and after Brui&s;es; that Bleeding is directed for a preg|nant Woman, if &s;he has a violent Cough; and that Bleeding is performed, by way of Precaution, in &s;everal other Ca&s;es. 4, We al&s;o advi&s;e Bleeding &s;ometimes to a&s;&s;wage an exce&s;&s;ive Pain, though &s;uch Pain is not owing to Exce&s;s of Blood, nor ari&s;es from any inflamed Blood; but in order to appea&s;e and moderate the Pain by Bleeding; and thereby to obtain Time for de&s;troying the Cau&s;e of it by other Remedies. But as the&s;e two la&s;t Rea&s;ons are in Effect involved or implied in the two fir&s;t; it may be very generally con|cluded, that an Exce&s;s of Blood, and an inflamed State of it, are the only two nece&s;&s;ary Motives for Bleeding.</P>
<P>&sect; 540. An Inflammation of the Blood is known by the Symp|toms accompanying tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, which that Cau&s;e produces. Of the&s;e I have already &s;poken, and I have at the &s;ame time regu|lated the Practice of Bleeding in &s;uch Ca&s;es. Here I &s;hall point out tho&s;e Symptoms and Circum&s;tances, which manife&s;t an Exce&s;s of Blood.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t, then, is the general Cour&s;e and Manner of the Pati|ent's living, while in Health. If he is a great Eater and in|dulges in juicy nutritious Food, and e&s;pecially on much Fle&s;h|meat; if he drinks rich and nouri&s;hing Wine, or other &s;trong Drink, and at the &s;ame time enjoys a good Dige&s;tion; if he takes but little Exerci&s;e, &s;leeps much, and has not been &s;ubject to any very con&s;iderable Evacuation, he may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to abound in Blood. It is very obvious that all the&s;e Cau&s;es rarely occur in Country People; if we except only the Abatement of their Exer|ci&s;e during &s;ome Weeks in Winter, which indeed may contribute to their generating more Blood than they ordinarily do.</P>
<P>The labouring Country-man, for much the greater Part of his Time, lives only on Bread, Water and Vegetables; Materials but very moderately nouri&s;hing, as one Pound of Bread proba|bly does not make, in the &s;ame Body, more Blood than one Ounce of Fle&s;h, though a general Prejudice &s;eems to have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed a contrary Opinion. The 2d is the total Stopping or long Interruption of &s;ome involuntary Bleeding or Haemorrhage, to which he had been accu&s;tomed. 3, A full and &s;trong Pul&s;e, and Veins vi&s;ibly filled with Blood, in a Body that is not lean and thin, and when he is not heated. 4, A florid lively Ruddine&s;s. 5. A con&s;iderable and unu&s;ual Numbne&s;s; Sleep more profound, of more Duration, and yet le&s;s tranquil and calm, than at other Times; a greater Propen&s;ity than ordinary to be fatigued after moderate Exerci&s;e or Work; and a little Oppre&s;&s;ion and Heavi|ne&s;s from walking. 6, Palpitations, accompanied &s;ometimes with very great Dejection, and even with a &s;light fainting Fit; e&s;pecially on being in any hot Place, or after moving about con|&s;iderably. 7, Vertigos, or Swimmings of the Head, e&s;pecially on bowing down and rai&s;ing it up at once, and after &s;leeping. 8,

Frequent Pains of the Head, to which the Per&s;on was not former|ly &s;ubject; and which &s;eem not to ari&s;e from any Defect in the Dige&s;tions. 9, An evident Sen&s;ation of Heat, pretty generally diffu&s;ed over the whole Body. 10, A &s;marting Sort of Itching all over, from a very little more Heat than u&s;ual. And la&s;tly, frequent Haemorrhages, and the&s;e attended with manife&s;t Relief, and more Vivacity.</P>
<P>People &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding, be cautious of &s;uppo&s;ing an unhealthy Exce&s;s of Blood, from any one of the&s;e Symptoms on|ly: many of them mu&s;t concur; and they &s;hould endeavour to be certain, that even &s;uch a Concurrence of them does not re&s;ult from a very different Cau&s;e, and wholly oppo&s;ite in Effect to that of an Exce&s;s of Blood.</P>
<P>But when it is certain, from the whole Appearance, that &s;uch an Exce&s;s doth really exi&s;t, then a &s;ingle, or even a &s;econd Bleed|ing is attended with very good Effects. Nor is it material, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, from what Part the Blood is taken.</P>
<P>&sect; 541. On the other hand, when the&s;e Circum&s;tances do not exi&s;t, Bleeding is in no wi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary: nor &s;hould it ever be practi&s;ed in the&s;e following Conditions and Circum&s;tances; except for &s;ome particular and very &s;trong Rea&s;ons; of the due Force of which none but Phy&s;icians can judge.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, when the Per&s;on is in a very advanced Age, or in very early Infancy. 2, When he is either naturally of a weakly Con|&s;titution, or it has been rendered &s;uch by Sickne&s;s, or by &s;ome other Accident. 3, When the Pul&s;e is &s;mall, &s;oft, feeble, and intermits, and the Skin is manife&s;tly pale. 4, When the Limbs, the Extremities of the Body, are often cold, puffed up and &s;oft. 5, When their Appetites has been very &s;mall for a long time; their Food but little nouri&s;hing, and their Per&s;piration too plenti|ful, from great Exerci&s;e. 6, When the Stomach has long been di&s;ordered, and the Dige&s;tion bad, whence very little Blood could be generated. 7, When the Patient has been con&s;iderably emp|tied, whether by Haemorrhages, a Loo&s;ene&s;s, profu&s;e Urine or Sweat: or when the <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> of &s;ome Di&s;temper has been effected by any one of the&s;e Evacuations. 8, When the Patient has long been afflicted with &s;ome depre&s;&s;ing Di&s;ea&s;e; and troubled with many &s;uch Ob&s;tructions as prevent the Formation of Blood. 9, Whenever a Per&s;on is exhau&s;ted, from whatever Cau&s;e. 10, When the Blood is in a thin, pale, and di&s;&s;olved State.</P>
<P>&sect; 542. In all the&s;e Ca&s;es, and in &s;ome others le&s;s frequent, a &s;ingle Bleeding often precipitates the Patient into an ab&s;olutely in|curable State, an irreparable Train of Evils. Mary di&s;mal Ex|amples of it are but too obvious.</P>
<P>Whatever, therefore, be the Situation of the Patient, and however naturally robu&s;t, that Bleeding, which is unnece&s;&s;ary, is noxious. Repeated, re-iterated Bleedings, weaken and ener|vate, ha&s;ten old Age, dimini&s;h the Force of the Circulation, thence fatten and puff up the Body; and next by weakening, and
<PB N="272" REF="012243_0292_0F8A6D8F076CD548">
la&s;tly by de&s;troying, the Dige&s;tions, they lead to a fatal Drop&s;y. They di&s;order the Per&s;piration by the Skin, and leave the Patient liable to Colds and Defluxions: They weaken the nervous Sy&s;tem, and render Per&s;ons &s;ubject to Vapours, to the hypochondriac Di&s;orders, and to all nervous Maladies.</P>
<P>The ill Con&s;equence of a &s;ingle, though erroneous Bleeding is not immediately di&s;cernible: on the contrary, when it was not performed in &s;uch a Quantity, as to weaken the Patient perceiv|ably, it appears to have been rather beneficial. Yet I &s;till here in&s;i&s;t upon it, that it is not the le&s;s true that, when unnece&s;&s;ary, it is prejudicial; and that People &s;hould never bleed, as &s;ome|times has been done, for meer Whim, or, as it were, for Diver|&s;ion. It avails nothing to affirm, that within a few Days after it, they have got more Blood than they had before it, that is, that they weigh more than at fir&s;t, whence they infer the Lo&s;s of Blood very &s;peedily repaired. The Fact of their augmented Weight is admitted; but this very Fact te&s;tifies again&s;t the real Benefit of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ding; &s;ince it is a Proof, that the natural Evacuati|ons of the Body are le&s;s compleatly made; and that Humours, which ought to be expelled, are retained in it. There remains the &s;ame Quantity of Blood, and perhaps a little more; but it is not a Blood &s;o well made, &s;o perfectly elaborated; and this is &s;o very true, that if the thing were otherwi&s;e; if &s;ome Days after the Bleeding they had a greater Quantity of the &s;ame Kind of Blood, it would amount to a Demon&s;tration, that more re-iterated Bleedings mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have brought on an inflammatory Di&s;|ea&s;e, in a Man of a robu&s;t Habit of Body.</P>
<P>&sect; 543. The Quantity of Blood which a grown Man may part with, by way of Precaution, is about ten Ounces.</P>
<P>&sect; 544. Per&s;ons &s;o con&s;tituted as to breed much Blood, &s;hould carefully avoid all tho&s;e Cau&s;es which tend to augment it, (See &sect; 540, No. 1.) and when they are &s;en&s;ible of the Quantity aug|mented, they &s;hould confine them&s;elves to a light frugal Diet, on Puls, Fruits, Bread and Water; they &s;hould often Bathe their Feet in warm Water, taking Night and Morning the Powder No. 20; drink of the Pti&s;an No. 1; &s;leep but very moderately, and take much Exerci&s;e. By u&s;ing the&s;e Precautions they may either prevent any Occa&s;ion for Bleeding, or &s;hould they really be obliged to admit of it, they would increa&s;e and prolong its good Effects. The&s;e are al&s;o the very Means which may remove all the Danger that might en&s;ue from a Per&s;on's omitting to bleed, at the u&s;ual Sea&s;on or Interval, when the Habit, the Fa&s;hion of Bleeding had been inveterately e&s;tabli&s;hed in him.</P>
<P>&sect; 545. We learn with Horror and A&s;toni&s;hment, that &s;ome have been bled eighteen, twenty and even twenty-four times in two Days; and &s;ome others, &s;ome <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How &s;hocking is this! and yet how true in &s;ome Countries!

This did not happen in our own Fleet; yet we are not as yet wholly exempt on Shore, from &s;ome Abu&s;e of Bleeding, which a few raw unthinking Operators are apt to con&s;ider as a meer Matter of Cour&s;e. I have in &s;ome other Place &s;tigmatized the Madne&s;s of Bleeding in Convul&s;ions, from ma|nife&s;t Exhau&s;tion and Emptine&s;s, with the Abhorrence it de&s;erves. <HI>K.</HI></NOTE> hundred times, in the Cour&s;e

of &s;ome Months. Such In&s;tances irrefragably demon&s;trate the continual Ignorance of their Phy&s;ician or Surgeon; and &s;hould the Patient e&s;cape, we ought to admire the inexhau&s;tible Re&s;our|ces of Nature, that &s;urvived &s;o many murderous Inci&s;ions.</P>
<P>&sect; 546. The People entertain a common Notion, which is, that the fir&s;t time of bleeding certainly &s;aves the Life of the Patient; but to convince them of the Fal&s;ity of this &s;illy Notion, they need only open their Eyes, and &s;ee the very contrary Fact to this occur but too unhappily every Day; many People dying &s;oon after their fir&s;t Bleeding. Were their Opinion right, it would be impo&s;&s;ible that any Per&s;on &s;hould die of the fir&s;t Di&s;ea&s;e that &s;eized him, which yet daily happens. Now the Extirpation of this ab&s;urd Opinion is really become important, as the Continuance of it is at|tended with &s;ome unhappy Con&s;equences: their Faith in, their great Dependance on, the extraordinary Virtue of this fir&s;t Bleed|ing makes them willing to omit it, that is, to trea&s;ure it up again&s;t a Di&s;temper, from which they &s;hall be in the greate&s;t Danger; and thus it is deferred as long as the Patient is not extremely bad, in Hopes that if they can do without it then, they &s;hall keep it for another and more pre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ion. Their pre&s;ent Di&s;ea&s;e in the Mean time ri&s;es to a violent Height; and then they bleed, but when it is too late, and I have &s;een In&s;tances of many Patients, who were permitted to die, that the fir&s;t Bleeding might be re&s;erved for a more important Occa&s;ion. The only Difference between the fir&s;t Bleeding, and any &s;ub&s;equent one is, that the fir&s;t commonly gives the Patient an Emotion, which is rather hurtful than &s;alu|tary.</P>

<P>It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> generally received, that Per&s;ons who have little or no Appetite need purging; &s;ince this i&s; often very fal&s;e, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e Cau&s;es, which le&s;&s;en or de&s;troy the Appetite, cannot be removed by purging; though many of them may be in|crea&s;ed by it.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who&s;e Stomachs contain much glairy vi&s;cid Matter &s;uppo&s;e, they may be cured by Purges, which &s;eem indeed at fir&s;t to relieve them; but this proves a very &s;light and deceitful Re|lief. The&s;e Humours are owing to that Weakne&s;s and Laxity of the Stomach, which Purges augment; &s;ince, notwith&s;tanding they carry off Part of the&s;e vi&s;cid Humours generated in it, at the Expiration of a few Days there is a greater Accumulation of them than before; and thus, by a Re-iteration of purging Medicines, the Malady &s;oon becomes incurable, and Health is irrecoverably lo&s;t. The real Cure of &s;uch Ca&s;es is effected by directly oppo&s;ite Medicines. Tho&s;e referred to, or mentioned, &sect; 272, are highly conducive to it.</P>
<P>&sect; 554. The Cu&s;tom of taking &s;tomachic Medicines infu&s;ed in Brandy, Spirit of Wine, Cherry Water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is always dangerous; for notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent immediate Relief &s;uch Infu&s;ions afford in &s;ome Di&s;orders of the Stomach, they really by &s;low De|grees impair and ruin that Organ; and it may be ob&s;erved, that as many as accu&s;tom them&s;elves to Drams, go off, ju&s;t like exce&s;|&s;ive Drinkers, in Con&s;equence of their having no Dige&s;tion; whence they &s;ink into a State of Depre&s;&s;ion and Languor, and die drop&s;ical.</P>
<P>&sect; 555. Either Vomits or Purges may be often beneficially omit|ted, even when they have &s;ome Appearance of &s;eeming nece&s;&s;ary, by abating one Meal a Day for &s;ome Time; by ab&s;taining from the mo&s;t nouri&s;hing Sorts of Food; and e&s;pecially from tho&s;e which are fat; by drinking freely of cool Water, and taking ex|traordinary Exerci&s;e. The &s;ame Regimen al&s;o &s;erves to &s;ubdue, without the U&s;e of Purges, the various Complaints which often invade tho&s;e, who omit taking purging Medicines, at tho&s;e Sea|&s;ons and Intervals, in which they have made it a Cu&s;tom to take them.</P>
<P>&sect; 556. The Medicines, No. 34 and 35, are the mo&s;t certain Vomits. The Powder, No. 21, is a good Purge, when the Pa|tient is in no Wi&s;e feveri&s;h.</P>
<P>The Do&s;es recommended in the Table of Remedies are tho&s;e, which are proper for a grown Man of a vigorous Con&s;titution. Neverthele&s;s there are &s;ome few, for whom they may be too weak: in &s;uch Circum&s;tances they may be increa&s;ed by the Addition of a third or fourth Part of the Do&s;e pre&s;cribed. But &s;hould they not operate in that Quantity, we mu&s;t be careful not to double the Do&s;e, much le&s;s to give a three-fold Quantity, which has &s;ome|times

been done, and that even without its Operation, and at the Ri&s;que of killing the Patient, which has not &s;eldom been the Con|&s;equence. In Ca&s;e of &s;uch Purging not en&s;uing, we &s;hould rather give large Draughts of Whey &s;weetened with Honey, or of warm Water, in a Pot of which an Ounce, or an Ounce and a half of common Salt mu&s;t be di&s;&s;olved; and this (Quantity is to be taken from Time to Time in &s;mall Cups, moving about with it.</P>
<P>The Fibres of Country People who inhabit the Mountains, and live almo&s;t &s;olely on Milk, are &s;o little &s;u&s;ceptible of Sen&s;ation, that they mu&s;t take &s;uch large Do&s;es to purge them, as would kill all the Pea&s;antry in the Vallies. In the Mountains of <HI>Valais</HI> there are Men who take twenty, and even twenty-four Grains of Gla&s;s of Antimony for a &s;ingle Do&s;e; a Grain or two of which were &s;ufficient to poi&s;on ordinary Men.</P>
<P>&sect; 557. Notwith&s;tanding our Cautions on this important Head, whenever an urgent Nece&s;&s;ity commands it, Purging mu&s;t be re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> to at all Times and Sea&s;ons: but when the Sea&s;on may be &s;afely detected, it were right to decline Purging in the Extremities of either Heat or Cold; and to take the Purge early in the Morn|ing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Medicines may find le&s;s Ob&s;truction or Embara&s;&s;|ment from the Contents of the Stomach.

The People are particularly aver&s;e to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Dog-days; and if this were only on Account of the great Heat, it would be very pardonable: but it is from an a&s;trological Prejudice, which is &s;o much the more ab&s;urd, as the real Dog-days are at thirty &s;ix Days Di&s;tance from tho&s;e common|ly reckoned &s;uch: and it is a melancholy Reflection, that the Ig|norance of the People &s;hould be &s;o gro&s;s, in this Re&s;pect, in our enlightened Age; and that they &s;hould &s;till imagine the Virtue and Efficacy of Medicines to depend on what Sign of the Zodiac the Sun is in, or on any particular Quarter on the Moon. Yet it is certain in this Point, they are &s;o inveterately attached to this Prejudice, that it is but too common to &s;ee Country-People die, in waiting for the Sign or Quarter mo&s;t favourable to the Ope|ration and effect of a Medicine, which was truly nece&s;&s;ary five or &s;ix Days before either of them. Sometimes too that particular Medicine is given, to which a certain Day is &s;uppo&s;ed to be au|&s;picious and favourable, in preference to that which is mo&s;t pre|valent again&s;t the Di&s;ea&s;e. And thus it is, that an ignorant Al|manack Maker determines on the Lives of the human Race; and contracts the Duration of them with Impunity.</P>
<P>&sect; 558. When a Vomit or a Purge is to be taken, the Patient's Body &s;hould be prepared for the Reception of it twenty-four Hours beforehand; by taking very little Food, and drinking &s;ome Gla&s;|&s;es of warm Water, or of a light Tea of &s;ome Herbs.</P>
<P>He &s;hould not drink after a Vomit, until it begins to work; but then he &s;hould drink very plentifully of warm Water, or a light Infu&s;ion of Chamomile Flowers, which is preferable.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="012243_0298_0F8A6D0EDD7E5E88">It is u&s;ual after Purges, to take &s;ome thin Broth or Soup dur|ing their Operation; but warm Water &s;weetened with Sugar or Honey, or an Infu&s;ion of Succory Flowers, would &s;ometimes be more &s;uitable.</P>
<P>&sect; 559. As the Stomach &s;uffers, in &s;ome Degree, as often as either a Vomit, or a Purge, is taken, the Patient &s;hould be care|ful how he lives, and orders him&s;elf for &s;ome Days after taking them, as well in Regard to the Quantity as Quality of his Food.</P>
<P>&sect; 560. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of other Articles taken by Way of Precaution, &s;uch as Soups, Whey, Waters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are but little u&s;ed among the People; but confine my&s;elf to this general Remark, that when they take any of the&s;e precautionary Things, they &s;hould enter on a Regimen or Way of living, that may co|operate with them, and contribute to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. Whey is commonly taken to refre&s;h and cool the Body; and while they drink it, they deny them&s;elves Puls, Fruits, and Sallads. They eat nothing then, but the be&s;t and heartie&s;t Fle&s;h-meats they can come at; &s;uch Vegetables as are u&s;ed in good Soups, Eggs, and good Wine; notwith&s;tanding this is to de&s;troy, by high and heat|ing Aliments, all the attemperating cooling Effects expected from the Whey.</P>
<P>Some Per&s;ons propo&s;e to cool and attemperate their Blood by Soups and a thin Diet into which they cram Craw fi&s;h, that heat con&s;iderably, or <HI>Na&s;turtium,</HI> Cre&s;&s;es which al&s;o heat, and thus de|feat their own Purpo&s;e, Happily in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, the Error in one Re&s;pect often cures that in the other; and the&s;e Kinds of Soup, which are in no Wi&s;e cooling, prove very &s;erviceable, in Con&s;equence of the Cau&s;e of the Symptoms, which they were in|tended to remove, not requiring any Coolers at all.</P>
<P>The general phy&s;ical Practice of the Community, which un|happily is but too much in Fa&s;hion, abounds with &s;imilar Errors. I will ju&s;t cite one, becau&s;e I have &s;een its di&s;mal Effects. Many People &s;uppo&s;e Pepper cooling, though their Smell, Ta&s;t, and common Sen&s;e concur to inform them of the contrary. It is the very hotte&s;t of Spices.</P>
<P>&sect; 561. The mo&s;t certain Pre&s;ervative, and the mo&s;t attainable too by every Man, is to avoid all Exce&s;s, and e&s;pecially Exce&s;s in eating and in drinking. People generally eat more than thoroughly con&s;i&s;ts with Health, or permits them to attain the utmo&s;t Vigour, of which their natural Con&s;titutions are capable. The Cu&s;tom is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and it is difficult to eradicate it: notwith&s;tanding we &s;hould at lea&s;t re&s;olve not to eat, but through Hunger, and al|ways under a Subjection to Rea&s;on; becau&s;e, except in a very few Ca&s;es, Rea&s;on con&s;tantly &s;ugge&s;ts to us not to eat, when the Sto|mach has an Aver&s;ion to Food. A &s;ober moderate Per&s;on is ca|pable of Labour, I may &s;ay, even of exce&s;&s;ive Labour of &s;ome Kinds; of which greater Eaters are ab&s;olutely incapable.

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXXIII. Of Mountebanks, Quacks, and Conjurers.</HEAD>
<P>SECT. 562. ONE dreadful Scourge &s;till remains to be treated of, which occa&s;ions a greater Mortality than all the Di&s;tempers I have hitherto de&s;cribed; and which, as long as it continues, will defeat our utmo&s;t Precautions to pre&s;erve the Health and Lives of the common People. This, or rather, the&s;e Scourges, for they are very numerous, are Quacks; of which there are two Species: The Mountebanks, or travelling Quacks, and tho&s;e pretended Phy|&s;icians in Villages and Country-Places, both male and female, known in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland</HI> by the Name of Conjurers, and who very effectually unpeople it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e, the Mountebanks, without vi&s;iting the Sick, or thinking of their Di&s;tempers, &s;ell different Medicines, &s;ome of which are for external U&s;e, and the&s;e often do little or no Mi&s;|chief; but their internal ones are much oftener pernicious. I have been a Witne&s;s of their dreadful Effects, and we are not vi&s;ited by one of the&s;e wandering Caitiffs, who&s;e Admi&s;&s;ion into our Coun|try is not mortally fatal to &s;ome of its Inhabitants. They are in|jurious al&s;o in another Re&s;pect, as they carry off great Sums of Money with them, and levy annually &s;ome thou&s;ands of Livres, among&s;t that Order of the People, who have the lea&s;t to &s;pare. I have &s;een, and with a very painful Concern, the poor Labourer and the Arti&s;an, who have &s;carcely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the common Nece&s;&s;a|ries of Life, borrow wherewithal to purcha&s;e, and at a dear Price, the Poi&s;on that was to compleat their Mi&s;ery, by increa&s;ing their Maladies; and which, where they e&s;caped with their Lives, has left them in &s;uch a languid and inactive State, as has reduced their whole Family to Beggary.</P>
<P>&sect; 563. An ignorant, knavi&s;h, lying and impudent Fellow will always &s;educe the gro&s;s and credulous Ma&s;s of People, incapable to judge of and e&s;timate any Thing rightly; and adapted to be the eternal Dupes of &s;uch, as are ba&s;e enough to endeavour to dazzle their weak Under&s;tandings; by which Method the&s;e vile Quacks will certainly defraud them, as long as they are tolerated. But ought not the Magi&s;trates, the Guardians, the Protectors, the po|litical Fathers of the People to interpo&s;e, and defend them from this Danger, by &s;everely prohibiting the Entrance of &s;uch Perni|cious Fellows into a Country, where Mens Lives are very e&s;timable, and where Money is &s;carce; &s;ince they extingui&s;h the fir&s;t, and carry off the la&s;t, without the lea&s;t Po&s;&s;ibility of their being in any wi&s;e u&s;eful to it. Can &s;uch forcible Motives as the&s;e &s;uffer our Magi&s;trates to delay <HI>their</HI> Expul&s;ion any longer, <HI>whom</HI> there never was the lea&s;t Rea&s;on for admitting?</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="012243_0300_0F8A6D111BE4C710">&sect; 564. It is acknowledged the Conjurers, the re&s;iding Conju|rers, do not carry out the current Money of the Country, like the itinerant Quacks; but the Havock they make among their Fellow Subjects is without Intermi&s;&s;ion, whence it mu&s;t be very great, as every Day in the Year is marked with many of their Vic|tims. Without the lea&s;t Knowledge or Experience, and offen&s;ive|ly armed with three or four Medicines, who&s;e Nature they are as thoroughly ignorant of, as of their unhappy Patients Di&s;ea&s;es; and which Medicines, being all violent ones, are very certainly &s;o many Swords in the Hands of raging Madmen. Thus armed and qualified, I &s;ay, they aggravate the &s;lighte&s;t Di&s;orders, and make tho&s;e that are a little more con&s;iderable, mortal; but from which the Patients would have recovered, if left &s;olely to the Conduct of Nature; and, for a &s;till &s;tronger Rea&s;on, if they had confided to the Guidance of her experienced Ob&s;ervers and A&s;&s;i&s;t|ants.</P>
<P>&sect; 565. The Robber who a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates on the High-way, leaves the Traveller the Re&s;ources of defending him&s;elf, and the Chance of being aided by the Arrival of other Travellers: But the Poi|&s;oner, who forces him&s;elf into the Confidence of a &s;ick Per&s;on, is a hundred times more dangerous, and as ju&s;t an object of Puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>The Bands of Highway-men, and their Individuals, that enter into any Country or Di&s;trict, are de&s;cribed as particularly as po&s;&s;i|ble to the Publick. It were equally to be wi&s;hed, we had al&s;o a Li&s;t of the&s;e phy&s;ical Impo&s;tors and Ignorants male and female; and that a mo&s;t exact De&s;cription of them, with the Number, and a brief Summary of their murderous Exploits, were faithfully pub|li&s;hed. By this Means the Populace might probably be in&s;pired with &s;uch a whole&s;ome Dread of them, that they would no long|er expo&s;e their Lives to the Mercy of &s;uch Executioners.</P>
<P>&sect; 566. But their Blindne&s;s, with re&s;pect to the&s;e two Sorts of maleficient Beings, is inconceivable. That indeed in Favour of the Mountebank is &s;omewhat le&s;s gro&s;s, becau&s;e, as they are not per&s;onally acquainted with him, they may the more ea&s;ily credit him with &s;ome Part of the Talents and the Knowledge he arro|gates. I &s;hall therefore inform them, and it cannot be repeated too often, that whatever o&s;tentatious Dre&s;s and Figure &s;ome of the&s;e Impo&s;tors make, they are con&s;tantly vile Wretches, who, incapable of earning a Livelyhood in an hone&s;t Way, have laid the Foundation of their Sub&s;i&s;tence on their own amazing Stock of Impudence, and that of the weak Credulity of the People; that they have no &s;cientific Knowledge; that their Titles and Patents are &s;o many Impo&s;itions, and inauthentic; &s;ince by a &s;hameful Abu&s;e, &s;uch Patents and Titles are become Articles of Com|merce, which are to be obtained at very low Prices; ju&s;t like the &s;econd-hand laced Cloaks which they purcha&s;e at the Brokers. That their Certificates of Cures are &s;o many Chimeras or Forge|ries; and that in &s;hort, if among the prodigious Multitudes of
<PB N="281" REF="012243_0301_0F8A6D1201C71400">
People who take their Medicines, &s;ome of them &s;hould recover, which it is almo&s;t phy&s;ically impo&s;&s;ible mu&s;t not &s;ometimes be the Ca&s;e, yet it would not be the le&s;s certain, that they are a pernicious de|&s;tructive Set of Men. A Thru&s;t of a Rapier into the Brea&s;t has &s;aved a Man's Life by &s;ea&s;onably opening an Impo&s;thume in it, which might otherwi&s;e have killed him: and yet internal pene|trating Wounds, with a &s;mall Sword, are not the le&s;s mortal for one &s;uch extraordinary Con&s;equence. Nor is it even &s;urprizing that the&s;e Mountebanks (which is equally applicable to the Con|jurers) who kill thou&s;ands of People, whom Nature alone, or a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a Phy&s;ician, would have &s;aved, &s;hould now and then cure a Patient, who had been treated before by the able&s;t Phy&s;i|cians. Frequently Patients of that Cla&s;s, who apply to the&s;e Mountebanks and Conjurers (whether it has been, that they would not &s;ubmit to the Treatment proper for their Di&s;tempers; or whether the real Phy&s;ician tired of the intractible Creatures has di&s;continued his Advice and Attendance) look out for &s;uch Doc|tors, as a&s;&s;ure them of a &s;peedy Cure, and venture to give them &s;uch Medicines as kill many, and cure one (who has had Con&s;ti|tution enough to overcome them) a little &s;ooner than a ju&s;tly re|putable Phy&s;ician would have done. It is but too ea&s;y to pro|cure, in every Pari&s;h, &s;uch Li&s;ts of their Patients, and of their Feats, as would clearly evince the Truth of whatever has been &s;aid here relating to them.</P>
<P>&sect; 567. The Credit of this Market, this Fair-hunting Doctor, &s;urrounded by five or &s;ix hundred Pea&s;ants, &s;taring and gaping at him, and counting them&s;elves happy in his conde&s;cending to cheat them of their very &s;carce and nece&s;&s;ary Ca&s;h, by &s;elling them, for twenty times more than its real Worth, a Medicine who&s;e be&s;t Quality were to be only a u&s;ele&s;s one; the Credit, I &s;ay, of this vile yet tolerated Cheat, would quickly vani&s;h, could each of his Auditors be per&s;uaded, of what is &s;trictly true, that except a little more Tenderne&s;s and Agility of Hand, he knows full as much as his Doctor; and that if he could a&s;&s;ume as much Impudence, he would immediately have as much Ability, would equally de&s;erve the &s;ame Reputation, and to have the &s;ame Confi|dence repo&s;ed in him.</P>
<P>&sect; 568. Were the Populace capable of rea&s;oning, it were ea&s;y to di&s;abu&s;e them in the&s;e Re&s;pects; but as it is, their Guardians and Conductors &s;hould rea&s;on for them. I have already proved the Ab&s;urdity of repo&s;ing any Confidence in Mountebanks, pro|perly &s;o called; and that Reliance &s;ome have on the Conjurers is &s;till more &s;tupid and ridiculous.</P>
<P>The very meane&s;t Trade requires &s;ome In&s;truction: A Man does not commence even a Cobler, a Botcher of old Leather, without &s;erving an Appretice&s;hip to it; and yet no Time has been &s;erved, no In&s;truction has been attended to, by the&s;e Pretenders to the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, u&s;eful and elegant Profe&s;&s;ion. We do not confide the mending, the cleaning of a Watch to any, who have

<P>&sect; 570. Some of the&s;e Caitiffs however, apprehending the Force and Danger of that Objection, founded on their Want of Study and Education, have endeavoured to elude it, by infu&s;ing and &s;preading a fal&s;e, and indeed, an impudent impious Prejudice a|mong the People, which prevails too much at pre&s;ent; and this is, that their Talents for Phy&s;ic are a &s;upernatural Gift, and, of Cour&s;e, greatly &s;uperior to all human Knowledge, it were going out of my Province to expatiate on the Indecency, the Sin, and the Irreligion of &s;uch Knavery, and incroaching upon the Rights and perhaps the Duty of the Clergy; but I intreat the Liberty of ob&s;erving to this re&s;pectable Order of Men, that this Super&s;tition, which is attended with dreadful Con&s;equences, &s;eems to call for their utmo&s;t Attention: and in general the Expul&s;ion of Super&s;ti|tion is the more to be wi&s;hed, as a Mind, imbued with fal&s;e Pre|judices, is le&s;s adapted to imbibe a true and valuable Doctrine. There are &s;ome very callous hardened Villains among this mur|dering Band, who, with a view to e&s;tabli&s;h their Influence and Revenue as well upon Fear as upon Hope, have horridly ventur|ed &s;o far as to incline the Populace to doubt, whether they re|ceived their boa&s;ted Gift and Power from Heaven or from Hell! And yet the&s;e are the Men who are tru&s;ted with the Health and Lives of many others.</P>
<P>&sect; 571. One Fact which I have already mentioned, and which it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to account for is, that great Earne&s;tne&s;s of the Pea&s;ant to procure the be&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance he can for his &s;ick Cattle. At whatever Di&s;tance the Farrier lives, or &s;ome Per&s;on who is &s;uppo&s;ed qualified to be one (for unfortunately there is not one in <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland</HI>) if he has con&s;iderable Reputation in this way, the Country-man goes to con&s;ult him, or purcha&s;es his Vi&s;it at any Price. However expen&s;ive the Medicines are, which the Hor&s;e|doctor directs, if they are accounted the be&s;t, he procures them for his poor Bea&s;t. But if him&s;elf, his Wife or Children fall &s;ick, he either calls in no A&s;&s;i&s;tance nor Medicines; or contents him|&s;elf with &s;uch as are next at hand, however pernicious they may be, though nothing the Cheaper on that Account; for certainly the Money, extorted by &s;ome of the&s;e phy&s;ical Conjurers from their Patients, but oftner from their Heirs, is a very &s;hameful Inju&s;tice, and calls loudly for Reformation.</P>
<P>&sect; 572. In an excellent Memoir or Tract, which will &s;hortly be publi&s;hed on the Population of <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> we &s;hall find an impor|tant
<PB N="284" REF="012243_0304_0F8A6D1463E86DB8">
and very affecting Remark, which &s;trictly demon&s;trates the Havock made by the&s;e immedical Magicians or Conjurers; and which is this: That in the common Cour&s;e of Years, the Propor|tion between the Numbers and Deaths of the Inhabitants of any one Place, is not extremely different in City and Country: but when the very &s;ame epidemical Di&s;ea&s;e attacks the City and the Vil|lages, the Difference is enormous; and the Number of Deaths of the Inhabitants of the Villages, where the Conjurer exerci&s;es his bloody Dominion, is found, upon Compari&s;on, greatly more than the Deaths in the City.</P>
<P>I find in the &s;econd Volume of the Memoirs of the oeconomi|cal Society of <HI>Berne,</HI> for the Year 1762, another Fact equally in|tere&s;ting, which is related by one of the mo&s;t intelligent and &s;a|gacious Ob&s;ervers, concerned in that Work, "Pleure&s;ies and Peripneumonies (he &s;ays) prevailed at <HI>Cottens a la C&ocirc;te</HI>; and &s;ome Pea&s;ants died under them, who had con&s;ulted the Conjurers, and taken their heating Medicines; while of tho&s;e, who pur&s;ued a directly oppo&s;ite Method, almo&s;t every one recovered."</P>
<P>&sect; 573. But I &s;hall employ my&s;elf no longer on this Topic, on which the Love of my Species alone has prompted me to &s;ay thus much; though it de&s;erves to be con&s;idered more in Detail, and is, in Reality, of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence. None, methinks, could make them&s;elves ea&s;y with re&s;pect to it &s;o much as Phy&s;i|cians, if they were conducted only by lucrative Views; &s;ince the&s;e Conjurers dimini&s;h the Number of tho&s;e poor People, who &s;ome|times con&s;ult the real Phy&s;icians, and with &s;ome Care and Trou|ble, but without the lea&s;t Profit, to tho&s;e Gentlemen. But what good Phy&s;ician is mean and vile enough to purcha&s;e a few Hours of Ea&s;e and Tranqillity at &s;o high, &s;o very odious a Price?</P>
<P>&sect; 574. Having thus clearly &s;hewn the Evils attending this cry|ing Nui&s;ance, I wi&s;h I were able to pre&s;cribe an effectual Remedy again&s;t it, which I acknowledge it is far from being ea&s;y to do.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Point probably was, to publi&s;h and de|mon&s;trate the great and public Danger, and to di&s;po&s;e the State to employ their Attention on this fatal, this mortal Abu&s;e; which, joined to the other Cau&s;es of Depopulation, has a manife<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Ten|dency to render <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland</HI> a De&s;art.</P>
<P>&sect; 575. The &s;econd, and doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t effectual Means, which I have already mentioned is, not to admit any travelling Mountebank to enter this Country; and to &s;et a Mark on all the Conjurers: It may probably al&s;o be found convenient, to inflict corporal Puni&s;hment on them; as it has been already adjudged in different Countries by &s;overeign Edicts. At the very lea&s;t they &s;hould be marked with public Infamy, according to the follow|ing Cu&s;tom practi&s;ed in a great City in <HI>France.</HI> "When any Mountebanks appeared in <HI>Montpelier,</HI> the Magi&s;trates had a Power to mount each of them upon a meagre mi&s;erable A&s;s, with his Head to the A&s;s's Tail. In this Condition they were led through|out the whole City, attended with the Shouts and Hooting of the

Children and the Mob, beating them, throwing Filth and Ordure at them, reviling them, and dragging them all about."</P>
<P>&sect; 576. A third conducive Means would be the In&s;tructions and Admonitions of the Clergy on this Subject, to the Pea&s;ants in their &s;everal Pari&s;hes. For this Conduct of the common People, amounting, in Effect, to Suicide, to Self-murder, it mu&s;t be im|portant to convince them of it. But the little Efficacy of the &s;tronge&s;t and repeated Exhortations on &s;o many other Articles, may cau&s;e us to entertain a very rea&s;onable Doubt of their Succe&s;s on this. Cu&s;tom &s;eems to have determined, that there is nothing in our Day, which excludes a Per&s;on from the Title and Appella|tion of an hone&s;t or honourable Man, except it be meer and con|victed Theft; and that for this &s;imple and obvious Rea&s;on, that we attach our&s;elves more &s;trongly to our Property, than to any thing el&s;e. Even Homicide is e&s;teemed and reputed honourable in many Ca&s;es. Can we rea&s;onably expect then to convince the Multitude, that it is criminal to confide the Care of their Health to the&s;e Poi&s;oners, in Hopes of a Cure of their Di&s;orders? A much likelier Method of &s;ucceeding on this Point would certainly be, to convince the deluded People, that it will co&s;t them le&s;s to be hone&s;tly and judiciou&s;ly treated, than to &s;uffer under the Hands of the&s;e Executioners. The Expectation of a good and cheap Health-market will be apt to influence them more, than their Dread of a Crime would.</P>
<P>&sect; 577. A fourth Means of removing or re&s;training this Nui&s;|ance would be to expunge, from the Almanacs, all the a&s;trologi|cal Rules relating to Phy&s;ic; as they continually conduce to pre|&s;erve and increa&s;e &s;ome dangerous Prejudices and Notions in a Science, the &s;malle&s;t Errors in which are &s;ometimes fatal. I had already reflected on the Multitude of Pea&s;ants that have been lo&s;t, from po&s;tponing, or mi&s;timing a Bleeding; only becau&s;e the &s;o|vereign Deci&s;ion of an Almanac had directed it at &s;ome other Time. May it not al&s;o be dreaded, to mention it by the way, that the &s;ame Cau&s;e, the Almanacs, may prove injurious to their rural Oeconomy and Management; and that by advi&s;ing with the Moon, which has no Influence, and is of no Con&s;equence in Vegetation or other Country Bu&s;ine&s;s, they may be wanting in a due Attention to &s;uch other Circum&s;tances and Regulations, as are of real Importance in them.</P>
<P>&sect; 578. A fifth concurring Remedy again&s;t this popular Evil would be the E&s;tabli&s;hment of Ho&s;pitals, for the Reception of poor Patients, in the different Cities and Towns of <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland.</HI></P>

Benefit to the Community, than any other Application of Money could produce. We mu&s;t either admit, that the Multi|tude, the Body of the People is u&s;ele&s;s to the State, or agree, that Care &s;hould be taken to pre&s;erve and continue them, A ve|ry re&s;pectable <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who, after a previous and thorough Con&s;ideration of this &s;ubject, had applied him&s;elf very a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly and u&s;efully on the Means of increa&s;ing the Riches and the Hap|pine&s;s of his Countrymen, complains, that in <HI>England,</HI> the very Country in which there are the mo&s;t Ho&s;pitals, the Poor who are &s;ick are not &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;i&s;ted. What a deplorable Deficience of the nece&s;&s;ary A&s;&s;i&s;tance for &s;uch mu&s;t then be in a Country, that is not provided with a &s;ingle Ho&s;pital? That Aid from Surgery and Phy&s;ic, which abounds in Cities, is not &s;ufficiently diffu&s;ed into Country Places; and the Pea&s;ants are liable to &s;ome &s;imple and moderate Di&s;ea&s;es, which, for want of proper Care, dege|nerate into a State of Infirmity, that &s;inks them into premature Death.</P>

And the Circum&s;pection to be u&s;ed in &s;uch Ca&s;es ought to be proportioned to the Intere&s;t the A&s;&s;i&s;tant takes in the Pre&s;ervation of the Pa|tient; and that Love of his Neighbour with which he is animated.</P>
<P>&sect; 585. Mu&s;t not the &s;ame Arguments and Reflections unavoid|ably &s;ugge&s;t the Nece&s;&s;ity of an entire Tractibility on the Part of the Patient, and of his Friends and A&s;&s;i&s;tants? The Hi&s;tory of Di&s;|ea&s;es which have their &s;tated times of Beginning, of manife&s;ting and di&s;playing them&s;elves; of arriving at, and continuing in their Height, and of decrea&s;ing; do not all the&s;e demon&s;trate the Nece&s;&s;ity of continuing the &s;ame Medicines, as long as the Cha|racter of the Di&s;temper is the &s;ame; and the Danger of changing them often, only becau&s;e what has been given has not afforded immediate Relief? Nothing can injure the Patient more than this In&s;tability and Caprice. After the Indication which his Di&s;tem|per &s;ugge&s;ts, appears to be well deduced, the Medicine mu&s;t be cho&s;en that is likelie&s;t to re&s;i&s;t the Cau&s;e of it; and it mu&s;t be con|tinued as long as no new Symptom or Circum&s;tance &s;upervenes, which requires an Alteration of it; except it &s;hould be evident, that an Error has been incurred in giving it. But to conclude that a Medicine is u&s;ele&s;s or in&s;ignificant, becau&s;e it does not re|move or abate the Di&s;temper as &s;peedily, as the Impatience of the Sick would naturally de&s;ire it; and to change it for another, is as unrea&s;onable, as it would be for a Man to break his Watch becau&s;e the Hand takes twelve Hours to make a Revolution round the Dial-plate.</P>
<P>&sect; 586. Phy&s;icians have &s;ome Regard to the State of the Urine of &s;ick Per&s;ons, e&s;pecially in inflammatory Fevers; as the Altera|tions occurring in it help them to judge of the Changes that may have been made in the Character and Con&s;i&s;tence of the Humours in the Ma&s;s of Blood; and thence may conduce to determine the Time, in which it will be proper to di&s;po&s;e them to &s;ome Evacua|tion. But is is gro&s;s Ignorance to imagine, and utter Knavery and Impo&s;ture to per&s;uade the Sick, that the meer In&s;pection of their Urine <HI>&s;olely</HI> &s;ufficiently enables others to judge of the Symp|toms and Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and to direct the be&s;t Remedies for it. This In&s;pection of the Urine can only be of U&s;e when it is duly in&s;pected; when we con&s;ider at the &s;ame Time the exact State, and the very Looks of the Patient; when the&s;e are compared with the Degree of the Symptoms of the Malady; with the other eva|cuations; and when the Phy&s;ician is &s;trictly informed of all external Circum&s;tances, which may be con&s;idered as foreign to the Malady; which may alter or affect the Evacuations, &s;uch as particular Ar|ticles of Food, particular Drinks, different Medicines, or the very Quantity of Drink. Where a Per&s;on is not furni&s;hed with an exact Account of the&s;e Circum&s;tances, the merr In&s;pection of the Urine is of no Service, it &s;ugge&s;ts no Indication, nor any Expedient; and
<PB N="290" REF="012243_0310_0F8A6D1BD42420C0">
meer common Sen&s;e &s;ufficiently proves, and it may be boldly affirm|ed, that whoever orders any Medicine, without any other Know|ledge of the Di&s;ea&s;e, than what an In&s;pection of the Urine affords, is a rank Knave, and the Patient who takes them is a Dupe.</P>
<P>&sect; 587. And here now any Reader may very naturally a&s;k, Whence can &s;uch a ridiculous Credulity proceed, upon a Subject &s;o e&s;&s;entially intere&s;ting to us as our own Health?</P>
<P>In An&s;wer to this it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that &s;ome Sources, &s;ome Cau&s;es of it &s;eem appropriated meerly to the People, the Multitude. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is, the mechanical Impre&s;&s;ion of Parade and Shew upon the Sen&s;es. 2, The Prejudice they have conceived, as I &s;aid before, of the Conjurers curing by a &s;uper|natural Gift. 3, The Notion the Country People entertain, that their Di&s;temper and Di&s;orders are of a Character and Species pe|culiar to them&s;elves, and that the Phy&s;icians, attending the Rich, know nothing concerning them. 4, The general Mi&s;take that their employing the Conjurer is much cheaper. 5, Perhaps a &s;heepi&s;h &s;hame-faced Timidity may be one Motive, at lea&s;t with &s;ome of them. 6, A Kind of Fear too, that Phy&s;icians will con&s;ider their Ca&s;es with le&s;s Care and Concern, and be likely to treat them more cavalierly; a Fear which increa&s;es that Confi|dence which the Pea&s;ant, and which indeed every Man has in his Equal, being founded in Equality it&s;elf. And 7, The Di&s;cour&s;e and Conver&s;ation of &s;uch illiterate Empirics being more to their Ta&s;t, and more adapted to their Apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>But it is le&s;s ea&s;y to account for this blind Confidence, which Per&s;ons of a &s;uperior Cla&s;s (who&s;e Education being con&s;idered as much better are regarded as better Rea&s;oners) repo&s;e in the&s;e boa&s;ted Remedies; and even for &s;ome Conjurer in Vogue. Never|thele&s;s even &s;ome of their Motives may be probably a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is that great Principle of <HI>Seity</HI> or <HI>Selfne&s;s,</HI> as it may be called, innate to Man, which attaching him to the Prolongation of his own Exi&s;tence, more than to any other thing in the Uni|ver&s;e, keeps his Eyes, his utmo&s;t Attention, continually fixed upon this Object; and compels him to make it the very Point, the Pur|po&s;e of all his Advances and Proceedings; notwith&s;tanding it does not permit him to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;afe&s;t Paths to it from the dangerous ones. This is the &s;ure&s;t and &s;horte&s;t Way, &s;ays &s;ome Collector at the Turnpike, he pays, pa&s;&s;es, and peri&s;hes from the Precipices that occur in his Route.</P>
<P>This very Principle is the Source of another Error, which con|&s;i&s;ts in repo&s;ing, involuntarily, a greater Degree of Confidence in tho&s;e, who flatter and fall in the mo&s;t with us in our favourite Opinions. The well appri&s;ed Phy&s;ician, who fore&s;ees the Length and the Danger of a Di&s;ea&s;e; and who is a Man of too much In|tegrity to affirm what he does not think, mu&s;t, from a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;truction of the human Frame and Mind, be li&s;tened to le&s;s favourably, than he who flatters us by &s;aying what we wi&s;h. We endeavour to elongate, to ab&s;ent our&s;elves, from the Sentiments,
<PB N="291" REF="012243_0311_0F8A6D1EC7CBC210">
the Judgment of the fir&s;t; we &s;mile, from Self-complacency, at tho&s;e of the la&s;t, which in a very little time are &s;ure of obtaining our Preference.</P>
<P>A third Cau&s;e, which re&s;ults from the &s;ame Principle is, that we give our&s;elves up the mo&s;t readily to his Conduct, who&s;e Me|thod &s;eems the lea&s;t di&s;agreeable, and flatters our Inclinations the mo&s;t. The Phy&s;ician who enjoins a &s;trict Regimen; who in&s;i&s;ts upon &s;ome Re&s;traints and Self-denials; who intimates the Nece&s;|&s;ity of Time and Patience for the Accompli&s;hment of the Cure, and who expects a thorough Regulation through the Cour&s;e of it, di&s;gu&s;ts a Patient who has been accu&s;tomed to indulge his own Ta&s;t and Humour; the Quack, who never he&s;itates at complying with it, charms him. The Idea of a long and &s;omewhat di&s;tant Cure, to be obtained at the End of an unplea&s;ant and unrelaxing Regimen, &s;uppo&s;es a very perilous Di&s;ea&s;e: this Idea di&s;po&s;es the Patient to Di&s;gu&s;t and Melancholy, he cannot &s;ubmit to it without Pain; and he embraces, almo&s;t uncon&s;ciou&s;ly, meerly to avoid this, an oppo&s;ite Sy&s;tem which pre&s;ents him only with the Idea of &s;uch a Di&s;temper, as will give way to a few Do&s;es of Simples.</P>
<P>That Propen&s;ity to the New and Marvellous, which tyrannizes over &s;o large a Proportion of our Species, and which has advanced &s;o many ab&s;urd Per&s;ons and Things into Reputation, is a fourth and very powerful Motive. An irk&s;ome Satiety, and a Tire&s;ome|ne&s;s, as it were, from the &s;ame Objects, is what our Nature is apt to be very apprehen&s;ive of; though we are ince&s;&s;antly conducted towards it, by a Perception of &s;ome Void, &s;ome Emptine&s;s in our&s;elves, and even in Society too: But new and extraordinary Sen&s;ations rou&s;ing us from this di&s;agreeable State, more effectual|ly than any Thing el&s;e, we unthinkingly abandon our&s;elves to them, without fore&s;eeing their Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>A fifth Cau&s;e ari&s;es from &s;even Eighths of Mankind being ma|naged by, or following, the other Eighth; and, generally &s;peak|ing, the Eighth that is &s;o very forward to manage them, is the lea&s;t fit and worthy to do it; whence all mu&s;t go ami&s;s, and ab|&s;urd and embarra&s;&s;ing Con&s;equences en&s;ue from the Condition of Society. A Man of excellent Sen&s;e frequently &s;ees only through the Eyes of a Fool, of an intriguing Fellow, or of a Cheat; in this he judges wrong, and his Conduct mu&s;t be &s;o too. A Man of real Merit cannot connect him&s;elf with tho&s;e who are addicted to cabal|ling; and yet &s;uch are the Per&s;ons, who frequently conduct others.</P>
<P>Some other Cau&s;es might be annexed to the&s;e, but I &s;hall men|tion only one of them, which I have already hinted, and the Truth of which I am confirmed in from &s;everal Years Experience; which is, that we generally love tho&s;e who rea&s;on more ab&s;urdly than our&s;elves, better than tho&s;e who convince us of our own weak Rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>I hope the Reflections every Reader will make on the&s;e Cau&s;es of our ill Conduct upon this important Head, may contribute to cor|rect or dimini&s;h it; and to de&s;troy tho&s;e Prejudices who&s;e fatal Effects we may continually ob&s;erve.</P>

<P>The Pound which I mean, throughout all the&s;e Pre&s;criptions, is that con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixteen Ounces. The&s;e Ounces contain eight Drachms, each Drachm con&s;i&s;ting of three Scruples, and each Scruple of twenty Grains; the medical Scruple of <HI>Paris</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lely containing twenty-four Grains.</P>

<P>The &s;mall drinking Gla&s;s we talk of, filled &s;o as not to run over, contains three Ounces and three Quarters. But filled, as we pro|po&s;e it &s;hould for the Sick, is to be e&s;timated only at three Ounces.</P>
<P>The common middle &s;ized Cup, though rather large than little, contains three Ounces and a Quarter. But as dealt out to the Sick, it &s;hould not be e&s;timated, at the utmo&s;t, above three Ounces.</P>
<P>The &s;mall Cla&s;s contains &s;even common Spoonfuls; &s;o that a Spoonful is &s;uppo&s;ed to be equal to half an Ounce.</P>
<P>The &s;mall Spoon, or Coffee Spoon, when of its u&s;ual Size and Cavity, may contain thirty Drops, or a few more; but, in the Exhibition of Medicines, it may be reckoned at thirty Drops. Five or &s;ix of the&s;e are deemed equal in Mea&s;ure, to a common Soup-Spoon.</P>
<P>The Ba&s;on or Porrenger, mentioned in the pre&s;ent Treati&s;e, holds, without running over, the Quantity of five Gla&s;&s;es, which is equivalent to eighteen Ounces and three Quarters. It may be e&s;timated, however, without a Fraction, at eighteen Ounces; and

Some Patients have been &s;o familiarized to it, as to take at length half an Ounce daily.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Our learned and candid Author has a very long Note in this Place, &s;trongly in Favour of <HI>Storck</HI>'s Extract of Hemlock; in which it is evident he credits the greater Part of the Cures affirmed by Dr. STORCK to have been effected by it. He &s;ays he made &s;ome him&s;elf, out not of the right Hemlock, which we think it very difficult to mi&s;take, from its peculiar rank fetid Smell, and its purple &s;pot|ted Stalk. After fir&s;t taking this him&s;elf, he found it mitigated the Pain of Cancers, but did not cure them. But then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Dr. <HI>Storck,</HI> and exactly following his Directions in making it, he took of Dr. <HI>Storck</HI>'s Extract, and of his own, which exactly re&s;embled each other, to the Quantity of a Drachm and a half daily; and finding his Health not in the lea&s;t impaired by it; he then gave it to &s;everal Patients, curing many &s;crophulous and cancerous Ca&s;es, and mitigating others, which he &s;uppo&s;es were incurable. So that he &s;eems ful|ly per&s;uaded Dr. STORCK's Extract is always innocent [which in fact, except in a very few In&s;tances, none of which were fatal, it has been with us] and he thinks it a Specific in many Ca&s;es, to which nothing can be &s;ub&s;tituted as an equivalent Remedy; that it &s;hould he taken with entire Confidence, and that it would be ab&s;urd to neglect its Continuance.</P>
<P>The Tran&s;lator of this Work of Dr. TISSOT's has thought it but fair to give all the Force of this Note here, which mu&s;t be his own, as his Editor at <HI>Lyons</HI> &s;eems to entertain a very different Opinion of the Efficacy of this Medi|cine; for which Opinion we refer back to his Note, &sect; 375, of this Treati&s;e, which the Reader may compare with this of our Author's. <HI>K.</HI></P></NOTE></P>

<P>No. 58. Take of the Roots of Gra&s;s and of Succory well wa&s;hed, each one Ounce. Boil them a Quarter of an Hour in a Pint of Wa|ter. Then di&s;&s;olve in it half an Ounce of Sedlitz, or of <HI>Ep&s;om</HI> Salt, and two Ounces of Manna; and &s;train it off to drink one Gla&s;s of it from half Hour to half Hour, till its Effects are &s;uf|ficient. It is to be repeated at the Interval of two or three Days.</P>
<P>No. 59. Is a Catapla&s;m or Pultice made of Crumb of Bread, with Ca|momile Flowers boiled in Milk, and the Addition of &s;ome Soap, &s;o that each Pultice may contain half a Quarter of an Ounce of this la&s;t Ingredient. And when the Circum&s;tances of female Pa|tients have not afforded them that regular Attendance, which the Repetition of the Pultice requires, as it &s;hould be renewed every three Hours, I have &s;ucce&s;sfully directed the Hemlock Plai&s;ter of the Shops.</P>
<P>No. 60. Take a &s;ufficient Quantity of dry Hemlock Leaves: Secure them properly between two Pieces of thin Linen Cloth, &s;o as to make a very flexible Sort of &s;mall Matra&s;s, letting it boil few Moments in Water, then &s;queeze it out and apply it to the affect|ed Part. It mu&s;t thus be moi&s;tened and heated afre&s;h, and re|applied every two Hours.</P>
<P>No. 61. Take of the Eyes of the Craw-fi&s;h, or of the true white Mag|ne&s;ia, two Drachms; of Cinnamon powdered four Grains. Rub them very well together, and divide the whole into eight Do&s;es. One of the&s;e is to be given in a Spoonful of Milk, or of Water, before the Infant &s;ucks.</P>
<P>No. 62. Take of an Extract of Walnuts, made in Water, two Drachms; and di&s;&s;olve it in half an Ounce of Cinnamon Water. Fifty Drops a Day of this Solution is to be given to a Child of two Years old: and after the whole has been taken, the Child &s;hould be purged. This Extract is to be made of the unripe Nuts, when they are of a proper Growth and Con&s;i&s;tence for pickling.</P>
<P>No. 63. Take of Rezin of Jalap two Grains, Rub it a con&s;iderable time with twelve or fifteen Grains of Sugar, and afterwards with three or four &s;weet Almonds; adding, very gradually, two com|mon Spoonfuls of Water. Then drain it through clear thin Li|nen as the Emul&s;ion of Almonds was ordered to be. La&s;tly, add a Tea Spoonful of Syrup of Capillaire to it. This is no di&s;|agreeable Draught, and may be given to a Child of two Years old: and if they are older, a Grain or two more of the Rezin may be allowed. But under two Years old, it is prudent to purge Children rather with Syrup of Succory, or with Manna.</P>

<P>No. 64. Take of the Ointment called <HI>Nutritum</HI> one Ounce; the entire Yolk of one &s;mall Egg, or the Half of a large one, and mix them well together.

<P>No. 65. Melt four Ounces of white Wax; add to it, if made in Win|ter, two Spoonfuls of Oil; if in Summer none at all, or at mo&s;t not above a Spoonful. Dip in this Slips of Linen Cloth not worn too thin, and let them dry: or &s;pread it thin and evenly over them.</P>
<P>No. 66. Take of Oil of Ro&s;es one Pound; of red Lead half a Pound; of Vinegar four Ounces. Boil them together, nearly to the Con|&s;i&s;tence of a Plai&s;ter; then di&s;&s;olve in the liquid Ma&s;s an Ounce and a half of yellow Wax, and two Drachms of Camphor, &s;tir|ring the whole about well. Remove it then from the Fire, and &s;pread it on Sheets or Slips of Paper, of what Size you think mo&s;t convenient. The Ointment of <HI>Chambauderie,</HI> &s;o famous in many Families on the Continent, is made of a Quarter of a Pound of yellow Wax, of the Plai&s;ter of three Ingredients (very nearly the &s;ame with No. 66) of compound Diachylon, and of common Oil, of each the &s;ame Quantity, all melted together, and then &s;tirred about well, after it is removed from the Fire, till it grows cold. To make a Sparadrap, or Oil-cloth (which is Linen, covered with, or dipt in an empla&s;tic Sub&s;tance or Oint|ment) it mu&s;t be melted over again with the Addition of a little Oil, and applied to the Linen as directed at No. 65.</P>

It is to be beat well with a Hammer, till it becomes &s;oft and very pliable. This is the only Preparation it requires, and a Slice of it of a proper Size is to be applied directly over the bur&s;ting, open Blood-ve&s;&s;els. It con&s;tringes and brings them clo&s;e together; &s;tops the Bleedings; and generally falls off at the End of two Days. 3. The third Part, adherring to the &s;econd, may &s;erve to &s;top the Bleeding from the &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els; and the fourth and la&s;t Part may be reduced to Powder, as conducing to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Our Author atte&s;ts his &s;eeing the happie&s;t Con&s;equences from this Applica|tion, which M.
