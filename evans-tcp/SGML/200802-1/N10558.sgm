<Q>FOR he is the mini&s;ter of GOD to thee for good.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_AS man was formed a &s;ociable crea|ture, capable of the delights and advantages of &s;ocial life; to be enjoyed in pur&s;uing his own good, with that of others at the &s;ame time; con&s;equently, his happine&s;s in degree mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t, in the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e &s;ocial virtues e&s;&s;ential to his nature. And that the&s;e may be gratified, there mu&s;t be opportunity had therefor. Which is obtained in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by men's forming into &s;ociety and connections; each individual
<PB N="6" REF="013382_0005_0F90576A8A7C6ED8">
becoming a member of the community; whereby, they may be mutually &s;erviceable to each other; and promote the good of the whole collectively.&mdash;For the &s;trength of each member united, forms the &s;trength of the whole body: de&s;igned for general &s;ecurity and publick happine&s;s. And capacitates all, both rulers and &s;ubjects, to &s;erve GOD and their generation, better than their condition would permit them to do, while un|connected individuals.</P>
<P>THIS appears to be an obvious dictate of nature. For 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed that all, even the mo&s;t ignorant and barbarous nations on earth, entirely de&s;titute of the light of divine revelation, are under at lea&s;t, &s;ome general political rules of government. Nor can a people &s;ub&s;i&s;t in a vi|cinity, with any tolerable &s;afety without it. For 'tis ob&s;erved, that a &s;tate of mere anarchy, is a &s;tate of perpetual war; where no &s;ecurity, or &s;ocial happine&s;s can be expected.</P>
<P>VARIOUS are the forms of civil government, that have obtained in different countries, through &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages. 'Tis evidently the will of GOD, and agreeable to the nature of man, to form into &s;ocieties; not only of a religious, but likewi&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="013382_0006_0F90576AA5203238">
of a political nature; for mutual good and pub|lick benefit. But he has not been plea&s;ed to give us the particular form of it, to be perpe|tually ob&s;erved by all generations. This appears to be left among the di&s;cretionaries to the &s;ons of men. As all are born free, therefore antecedent to all combinations, no one has an inherent, independent, underived power and right of <HI>domi|nion</HI> over his neighbour.</P>
<P>BUT in an unconnected &s;tate of independent liberty, nothing forbids a people, by mutual con|&s;ent incorporating, and becoming a body politick, con&s;i&s;ting of rulers and &s;ubjects; which is com|pri&s;ed in the <HI>idea</HI> of civil government. And the &s;ubjects may give up of their rights, liberties and properties; and put all that power into the hands of the rulers, <HI>&s;o far,</HI> as is nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer the good ends of government: the publick &s;afety and happine&s;s. And when this is done by free con|&s;ent, and mutual compact, it becomes the moddle of government&mdash;the band of &s;ociety:&mdash;it limits the power of the rulers&mdash;&s;ecures the rights of the people&mdash;is the &s;tandard of ju&s;tice for rulers, and &s;ubjects&mdash;and the regulating mea&s;ure of duty to both, mutually.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="013382_0007_0F90576B58BD1D58">THERE is (probably) no human form of government on earth, free of all po&s;&s;ible inconve|niencies. And perhaps no one form can &s;ute the &s;tate and genius of every nation (if of any one) at all times. Which probably is one rea&s;on of that multifarious government that obtains in the world of mankind.</P>
<P>BUT, the <HI>Briti&s;h legi&s;lature,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of three branches; <HI>to check, moderate, and temper each other</HI>; it is imagined is preferable to any other, we have the knowledge of. GOD grant, the Briti&s;h con&s;titution may long continue!&mdash;the ju&s;t claims of the <HI>crown</HI> and <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> be mutually ac|knowledged, and fully enjoyed: without which the good ends of government may not be looked for.</P>
<P>WHEN men in free &s;tates, (under the direct|ing and di&s;po&s;ing providence of GOD) are, by the &s;uffrages of electors, put into &s;eats of power and government, (&s;o far as it corre&s;ponds with the divine will,) GOD as it were ratifies it; whereby they become civil mini&s;ters of GOD: and as &s;uch are to be acknowledged, and treated by the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013382_0008_0F90576C1FE63AB0">THUS the context: <HI>Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject unto the higher powers. For there is no power, but of GOD: the powers that be are ordained of GOD. Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of GOD.</HI> But le&s;t any &s;hould be filled with unnece&s;&s;ary apprehen&s;ions from the civil &s;word, St. Paul adds, <HI>wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou &s;halt have prai&s;e of the &s;ame.</HI> For civil power, as an ordinance of GOD, was never de&s;igned to hurt the innocent; but to protect and defend them; as well as to puni&s;h offenders. For as in the text <HI>he</HI> (that is the civil magi&s;trate) <HI>is the mini&s;ter of GOD to thee for good.</HI> As this will be the effect and con&s;equenct of wi&s;e government, duly exerci&s;ed, and chearfully &s;ubmitted to for con&s;ceience &s;ake.</P>
<P>THE words thus introduced, invite our atten|tion <HI>to three things.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. CIVIL rulers are an ordinance of GOD. &mdash;He is the mini&s;ter of GOD.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE &s;ubject, concerning and over whom, civil government is to be exerci&s;ed; <HI>i.e.</HI> the people under government. For he is the mini&s;ter of GOD to thee.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="10" REF="013382_0009_0F90576D705949F0">III. THE great, and primary end of government, (&s;ubordinate to GOD's glory) is the good of mankind, or the publick intere&s;t, He is the mini&s;ter of GOD to thee for good.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e in order.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>CIVIL rulers are an ordinance of GOD. &mdash;He is the mini&s;ter of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>To evidence which we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>FIRST,</P>
<P>THAT it is apparently agreeable to the will of GOD, as his ordinance, evidently pointed out, and pre&s;cribed in the &s;acred oracles; that there &s;hould be rulers and &s;ubjects, with expre&s;t duties enjoined upon rulers, by divine authority, to act in character, as civil mini&s;ters of GOD. And I need not depart from the <HI>text,</HI> and context, fully to e&s;tabli&s;h the point in view. St. Paul expre&s;sly &s;ays, <HI>There is no power but of GOD:</HI> (i. e. no ju&s;t power that GOD will ever own) <HI>the powers that he, are ordained of GOD. Who|&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the power,</HI> (with which the civil magi&s;trate is properly inve&s;ted, and duly exerci&s;es), <HI>re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of GOD. For
<PB N="11" REF="013382_0010_0F90576DA17961B8">
he is the mini&s;ter of GOD.</HI> For which rea&s;on, rebellion again&s;t ju&s;t authority, properly exerci&s;ed, is re&s;i&s;ting an ordinance of GOD; and not of man only. The civil magistrate is a revenger in GOD's &s;tead, <HI>to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</HI> For this he does, not in a private capacity, but as GOD's mini&s;ter and &s;ervant. This chap|ter, which is called by &s;ome, the politicks of St. Paul, &s;uffici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tly confirms the truth of the pro|po&s;ition. But as this point has often been largely di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in this de&s;k, on a like occa&s;ion, I &s;hall but touch upon it: and proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P>SECONDLY,</P>
<P>THAT the directing and over-ruling provi|dence of GOD, is &s;pecially concerned, in the di&s;po&s;al of civil power and authority; into the hands of individuals for publick u&s;e. This is &s;o manife&s;t a truth, that it cannot be denied; without denying GOD's government over his own world: to do which, is no better than &s;aying there is no GOD. For there is <HI>no event</HI> can take place in the univer&s;e, unconnected with the go|verning, and di&s;po&s;ing providence of GOD.</P>
<P>AND as it is the plea&s;ure of HEAVEN, that there &s;hould be magi&s;trates, to protect the inno|cent&mdash;puni&s;h the guilty&mdash;and guard the peace of
<PB N="12" REF="013382_0011_0F90576E61155858">
&s;ociety; &s;o there is evidently <HI>the hand of divine Providence,</HI> in directing to the particular per&s;ons for rulers. Which &s;eems to be more e&s;pecially concerned in this, than in many other matters. For the &s;upreme Ruler him&s;elf, has been wont &s;ometimes, to intere&s;t him&s;elf, &s;o far, as to nomi|nate and appoint the individuals: as Saul, David, Solomon and others. Thus, he called Cyrus by name, at lea&s;t two hundred years before he was born, to rule over the Per&s;ian empire; and to do &s;ignal &s;ervice for GOD, and his people. <HI>Thus &s;aith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, who&s;e right-hand I have holden, to &s;ubdue nations before him: For Jacob my &s;ervant's &s;ake, and I&s;rael mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xlv.1, 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>INDEED, the di&s;po&s;ing providence of GOD is evidently concerned in events, to men, the mo&s;t contingent and fortuitous. As the wi&s;e man ob&s;erves, <HI>The lot is ca&s;t into the lap: but the whole di&s;po&s;ing thereof is of the LORD.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvi.33.</NOTE> With great truth and propriety then we may &s;ay, that the providential hand of the <HI>&s;upreme Ruler</HI> of the world, is very &s;pecially concerned in the di&s;po&s;al of government over men: and that equally &s;o, even in the mo&s;t free elective &s;tates. For GOD
<PB N="13" REF="013382_0012_0F90576F6C8BCB18">
has the hearts of all men, as well as of kings, in his hand: and as the rivers of water, he turneth them whither&s;oever he will.</P>
<P>And to &s;ay,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Civil mini&s;ters are an ordinance of GOD, in as much as it is by direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from GOD, they are enabled to act up to their character, in di&s;charging the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them. The divine &s;y&s;tem of moral govern|ment, holds forth much light and direction to civil rulers: and the more they conform to it, in heart and in life, the better will they an&s;wer to the appellation given them as <HI>Gods</HI>; and more effectually reach their character, as civil mini&s;ters of GOD, for publick good to mankind.</P>
<P>AND we find wi&s;dom it&s;elf, (or CHRIST) expre&s;sly &s;ays, <HI>Coun&s;el is mine, and &s;ound wi&s;dom: I am under&s;tanding; I have &s;trength. By me kings reign, and princes decree ju&s;tice. By me prin|ces rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Prov. viii.14, 15, 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>KING Solomon &s;ays, <HI>The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whither&s;oever he will.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxi.1.</NOTE> And early upon
<PB N="14" REF="013382_0013_0F90576FEDD64890">
his acce&s;&s;ion to the jewi&s;h throne, although he was &s;econd to none for wi&s;dom; yet &s;en&s;ible of the importance of his exalted &s;tation, and his need of divine aids to &s;way the &s;cepter in righ|teou&s;ne&s;s; he a&s;ked for an under&s;tanding heart, to di&s;cern judgment, and rule over &s;o great a people. This he preferred to any other gift, when put to his option: and the thing plea&s;ed the LORD; who not only granted his reque&s;t, but added likewi&s;e riches and honour.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Kings, chap. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>A &s;en&s;ible dependence on GOD the <HI>&s;upreme Ruler,</HI> and exhau&s;tle&s;s &s;ource of light, under&s;tan|ding and wi&s;dom for direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is highly becoming political rulers. And doubtle&s;s every one of that dignified character, who&s;e hearts are warmed and influenced by the love of GOD, and benevolence to man, will &s;ervently de&s;ire, and earne&s;tly a&s;k wi&s;dom of <HI>HIM, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James 1.5.</NOTE> That he may ri&s;e up to the character of a &s;ervant, and in&s;trument of GOD, for publick good to man|kind: who&s;e happine&s;s he feels him&s;elf intere&s;ted in, and deeply concerned to promote.</P>
<P>Which brings into view, the</P>
<P N="2">II. General propo&s;ition, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="013382_0014_0F905771490BCBC0">THE &s;ubject, concerning and over whom, civil government is to be exerci&s;ed: <HI>i. e.</HI> the people under government. He is the mini&s;ter of GOD to <HI>THEE.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the next, and immediate object, that claims the attention of civil rulers. 'Tis expre&s;|&s;ed in the <HI>text</HI> by the word THEE; which altho' it be of the &s;ingular number, yet in this connexion it admits of a plural con&s;truction. It means the &s;ubjects over whom civil mini&s;ters of GOD are &s;et.</P>
<P>RULERS and &s;ubjects are correlates, in free elective &s;tates (like this colony), they have a ne|ce&s;&s;ary relation to, and mutual dependence on each other: Nor can it be otherwi&s;e in all re|&s;pects, &s;o long as that relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>GOD never ordained magi&s;tracy, and by his di&s;po&s;ing providence advanced men to &s;eats of dignity and authority over others, to have <HI>&s;elf,</HI> and their own private intere&s;t, the grand object to aim at. Such a thought, would be a di&s;hon|orable reflection upon the wi&s;dom and benevo|lence of the <HI>&s;upreme Ruler.</HI></P>
<P>NO one can pretend that civil government, as an ordinance of GOD, was ever de&s;igned to advance men to &s;eats of dignity and rule, to plume them&s;elves with the gilded feathers of &s;tate; in order to indulge &s;loth&mdash;luxury&mdash;and avarice, at
<PB N="16" REF="013382_0015_0F9057716AB26F68">
publick expence. Much le&s;s wantonly to exer|ci&s;e the power with which they are inve&s;ted, in acting the tyrant. Nor yet, to improve fawning dependents and parricides, to oppre&s;s the &s;ubjects with uncon&s;titutional decrees, and unrighteous mea&s;ures, which they will greedily execute, for a low title, and a piece of bread. <HI>Surely no.</HI></P>
<P>GOD's in&s;titutions are all worthy of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>CIVIL RULERS are to fix their eyes, and their hearts too, upon the intere&s;ting concerns of their &s;ubjects; &s;o far as they are found within the province of rulers. And if they loo&s;e &s;ight of that object, they will mi&s;s the mark; and fail of reaching the end of their in&s;titution. For it mu&s;t be remembred, that, rulers (as an ordinance of GOD,) are <HI>made for the people</HI>; and not people for the rulers. And they are by divine appoint|ment, <HI>to attend continually upon this very thing.</HI> And in return, a tribute of honour, love, fear, &s;ubjection and reward; in proportion to the dig|nity of their re&s;pective departments and &s;ervices, is their due from the &s;ubject. Thus &s;ays the Apo&s;tle to the Gentiles: <HI>Wherefore, ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for wrath, but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake. For, for this cau&s;e, pay you tribute al&s;o: for they are GOD's mini&s;ters, attending continu|ally upon this very thing. Render therefore to all
<PB N="17" REF="013382_0016_0F905772163472C0">
their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due, cu&s;tom to whom cu&s;tom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cont. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE> And a general rea&s;on for which, is &s;ummed up in the words of our text; <HI>For he is the mini&s;ter of GOD to thee for good.</HI></P>
<P>AND this turns our attention to the</P>
<P N="3">III. GENERAL ob&s;ervation, viz.</P>
<P><HI>THE</HI> great and primary end of civil govern|ment, (next to the honour of GOD,) is the good of mankind; or the publick intere&s;t. For he is the mini&s;ter of GOD to thee for <HI>GOOD.</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>is the very end,</HI> for which the GOD of Heaven in&s;tituted the order. It is an expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>divine benevolence</HI> to the children of men; whereby they are put into a capacity of acting agreeable to their &s;ocial nature; and thereby of promoting their own, and each others happine&s;s. And what lower end can render it expedient, or beneficial for men born free; to give up certain native rights to others, and &s;ubject them&s;elves to government; by incorporating into civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>SURELY no people, who have ta&s;ted the &s;weets of liberty, and enjoyed the happine&s;s of freedom, would ever do it; but from a rational
<PB N="18" REF="013382_0017_0F905777045B1108">
pro&s;pect of benefit to the whole, and to each individual. <HI>Not to loo&s;e, but with a &s;pecial view to &s;ecure and perpetuate their per&s;onal liberties and properties, unmole&s;ted</HI>; as well as to enjoy the plea&s;ure of &s;ocial life, to be found in &s;ociety only.</P>
<P>AND how <HI>this</HI> may be effected by the civil magi&s;trate, comes now immediately under con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>AND this depends,</P>
<P>FIRST, Upon civil rulers them&s;elves being <HI>good</HI>; fearers of GOD, and haters of covetou&s;ne&s;s. &mdash;<HI>The GOD of I&s;rael &s;aid, the rock of I&s;rael &s;pake to me; he that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of GOD.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">II Sam. 23.3.</NOTE> This qualification GOD him&s;elf requires in civil rulers; that they be men of &s;trict probity, vertue and religion; who pay a &s;acred regard to the honour of GOD; by whom kings reign, and princes decree ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem,</HI> (and that only) can fully in&s;truct us in our duty: which con&s;i&s;ts in the love, fear, and veneration of the DEITY. From this <HI>root,</HI> the moral and &s;ocial vertues &s;pring, with univer&s;al benevolence to mankind. When civil rulers are influenced by this &s;pirit, nothing can intimidate, nothing ob&s;truct them in their
<PB N="19" REF="013382_0018_0F905778D3300490">
progre&s;s. For he who&s;e heart is warmed with <HI>divine love,</HI> or (in the emphatic language of in|&s;piration) <HI>toucht with a coal from the holy altar,</HI> is above frowns or flatteries; and moves in an exalted &s;phere, calm and un&s;haken: uninfluenced with bribes, and &s;uperior to oppo&s;ition. <HI>Vice,</HI> tho' it has his &s;corn, yet has his pity too: for his charity, his benevolence, is univer&s;ally extended to all. With this &s;pirit there is a beau|tiful coalition of &s;elf-love and benevolence: for both are gratified in promoting the good of man|kind. When this is the governing temper in civil rulers, it will effectually induce them, to make the <HI>divine oracles</HI> the man of their coun&s;el; and fetch their maxims of government from thence, where the <HI>be&s;t</HI> are to be found.</P>
<P>WICKED rulers, who fear not the LORD; are a cur&s;e to a people, over whom they are &s;et. King David &s;ays, <HI>The wicked walk on every &s;ide, when the vile&s;t men are exalted.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xii.8.</NOTE> GOD has &s;ometimes given &s;uch; but it was in anger, and in judgment; to puni&s;h the madne&s;s of the times, and cha&s;ti&s;e a rebellious people. As were &s;ome of the kings of I&s;rael and Judah; who did evil in the &s;ight of the LORD, and cau&s;ed the people to tran&s;gre&s;s. For it is an undoubted truth, that when corruption lies at, or near the fountain; it
<PB N="20" REF="013382_0019_0F905778F0296438">

<P>THUS, we find the impure &s;tream, opened by Jeroboam the king of I&s;rael, in e&s;tabli&s;hing idolatry, took a wide &s;pread; and run to the end of that unhappy kingdom. Hence that &s;tigma is fixt upon him by GOD him&s;elf; <HI>Jeroboam the &s;on of Nebat, who made I&s;rael to &s;in.</HI></P>
<P>WE might in&s;tance likewi&s;e in wicked Haman, that prime mini&s;ter in the Per&s;ian empire; who had &s;o great a&s;cendency over the king his ma&s;ter, as to induce him to a compliance with, and rati|fication of, his impolitic and dete&s;table plan; for cru&s;hing, and extirpating all the Jews in the realm, by a general carnage: which would have been <HI>much</HI> to the king's damage. The unrigh|teous and murderous edict, was &s;ealed with the royal &s;ignet, and forwarded with ha&s;ty di&s;patch, to the remote&s;t colonies in the empire: to be executed, within a pre&s;cribed limited time. But GOD, in his good providence, by the wi&s;e coun|&s;el of Mordecai, and interce&s;&s;ion of the queen; defeated the execrable de&s;ign, of that corrupt mini&s;ter; and brought him, through much di&s;|grace, to a condign puni&s;hment: for he &s;ought him&s;elf, and not the publick emolument.</P>

<P>THIRDLY,</P>
<P>THAT civil mini&s;ters of GOD may reach the end of their in&s;titution, <HI>the good of mankind</HI>; 'tis requi&s;ite that they enact &s;uch laws, and form &s;uch political regulations agreeable to the con&s;titution of the community, as are found nece&s;&s;ary for
<PB N="24" REF="013382_0023_0F90577BECA32B78">
the &s;afety, peace, and good order of the &s;tate.

For in a community wi&s;ely formed, and duly provided with laws, and all needful re|gulations for publick good; the weake&s;t mem|bers are &s;ecure as the &s;tronge&s;t; the poor as the rich; each having the &s;trength of the whole community, for his defence and &s;afeguard. To provide which, is doubtle&s;s within the province of the legi&s;lature; and the nature and well-being of &s;ociety renders it nece&s;&s;ary. And when this is done, and provided for by the legi&s;lative body; a good ba&s;is is laid, for &s;ocial happine&s;s, and pub|lick advantage;&mdash;e&s;pecially, if to this there be added,</P>
<P>FOURTHLY,</P>
<P>A wi&s;e, able, and faithful admini&s;tration.&mdash; Which conduces much to the publick emolu|ment, &mdash;the peace and happine&s;s of &s;ociety; and is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to an&s;wer the great and good ends of government.

<PB N="25" REF="013382_0024_0F90577CCD9E4078">
execute the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, with &s;kill, fidelity, and un&s;haken fortitude, in the impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; they become a terror to evil-doers: as well as defend the cau&s;e of the ju&s;t. They act then in character. For they bear not the &s;word in vain; but are &s;ervants, or mini&s;ters of GOD for publick good. For when a &s;pirit of <HI>mercy and truth, by which iniquity is purged,</HI><NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvi.6.</NOTE> runs through all ranks and orders of men, in civil tru&s;t and power, even down to the lowe&s;t informing officer; it &s;en&s;ibly beats down the head of vice, and checks the abounding of iniquity. Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors will be afraid of the <HI>&s;word</HI>; nor dare re&s;i&s;t the <HI>power.</HI> For there are doubtle&s;s many per&s;ons, of a vicious di&s;&s;olute character; who do not &s;ubmit and obey for con|&s;cience &s;ake, yet would do it for wrath.&mdash;But if a &s;y&s;tem of the be&s;t laws be enacted and pub|li&s;hed, yet if treated with neglect, or undue exe|cution of them; the good ends of government cannot be obtained.</P>
<P>'TIS therefore <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> that there be &s;et thrones of judgment: and they who &s;it thereon, be not only endowed with wi&s;dom &amp; under&s;tanding; but likewi&s;e <HI>de&s;pi&s;e the gain of oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;hake their hands from holding of bribes:</HI> and thence admi|ni&s;ter ju&s;tice with an impartial hand; whence

<P>ARE civil rulers an ordinance of GOD, de|&s;igned by HEAVEN for good to mankind? Then they are to be known and treated in character. Let none imagine, that 'tis characteri&s;tick of good rulers, to be all lenity and mercy; for &s;uch would not be for the publick emolument: the peace and good of &s;ociety. <HI>But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for be beareth not the &s;word in vain.</HI> Nor may he do &s;o.
