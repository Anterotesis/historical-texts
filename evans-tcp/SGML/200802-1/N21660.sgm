<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I</HEAD>
<P>IN tho&s;e days when A&s;tolpho, &s;urnamed the Proud, beheld his regal &s;way extend over the rich and fertile plains of Lombardy, the name of Roderic the Hardy was not un|known to fame. He had fought the battles of the empire; and an almo&s;t uninterrupted &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;s had crowned his arms. He had acquired immortal honour to him&s;elf, and a va&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of territory to his ma&s;ter; but wholly trained in the field of war, and little &s;killed in the cabals of a court, he found, af|ter a life almo&s;t exhau&s;tedin the painful pur|&s;uits of glory, the &s;miles of the king's coun|tenance withrawn.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="028486_0003_0FD922E0B3EB0FB8">
He no &s;ooner witne&s;&s;ed the dangerous gloom which began to thicken around him, than he prepared to pur&s;ue tho&s;e &s;teps which were mo&s;t likely to conduce to his &s;afety, and lead him to an a&s;ylum in which he might, in all probability, find a &s;helter from the gather|ing &s;torm. He retired, then, while it was yet &s;afe to retire from the capital, and &s;ought a ca&s;tle of his own near the frontiers of a lately conquered province&mdash;a retreat, in which the bolts of A&s;tolpho's wrath were but little likely to reach him. To this retirement he &s;ummoned an only &s;on, whom he had left be|hind him in the army, and who, though but a young &s;oldier, had already acquired a porti|on of fame little inferior to that of his fa|ther.</P>
<P>This &s;on, who was called Rhinaldo, had been, during the intervals which occurred be|tween each campaign, much re&s;ident at court and in the palace of A&s;tolpho fir&s;t beheld the lady I&s;abel, the daughter of the late king, and loved her. It would have been difficult indeed for a young man of the colde&s;t heart to behold her without emotion. In her dark eyes were mingled all the fire of genius with all the &s;oftne&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility; on her animated countenance &s;ate blended maje&s;ty and mild|ne&s;s; on her brow was pictured commanding beauty; in her &s;mile the mo&s;t winning &s;weet|ne&s;s; her &s;hape was faultle&s;s, and her demean|our
<PB N="5" REF="028486_0004_0FD922E394D45238">
artle&s;s and graceful; nor was I&s;abel blind to the merits of the young &s;oldier&mdash;a per&s;on the very &s;tandard of manly beauty&mdash;a coun|tenance, where every virtue of his heart was pourtrayed&mdash;a cultivated mind&mdash;a high and un&s;potted reputation, did not e&s;cape the ob|&s;ervation of the lady I&s;abel. They had fre|quent opportunities of conver&s;ing, and of tho&s;e opportunities a mutual pa&s;&s;ion was the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>The re&s;entment of A&s;tolpho became im|placable, when he heard of Count Roderic's retreat; and the very day after Rhinaldo had, in obedience to his father's mandates, quitted the army to join him in his retirement, or|ders arrived at the camp to &s;upercede him in his command, and cau&s;e him to be conveyed clo&s;e pri&s;oner to the capital.</P>
<P>The&s;e orders had, indeed, been preceded by a letter from the lady I&s;abel, warning Rhi|naldo of the danger which threatened him;&mdash;a letter, rendered not more dear to Rhinaldo by the noble proof it contained, than by the tender vows it breathed, of inviolable fide|lity.</P>
<P>In the retirement which his father had cho|&s;en, Rhinaldo pa&s;&s;ed many melancholy hours in meditating on his beloved but ab&s;ent I&s;a|bel. In vain did Count Roderic endeavour to divert his thoughts from the cea&s;ele&s;s ob|ject
<PB N="6" REF="028486_0005_0FD922E598FDB098">
of their attention, by di&s;&s;ertations on that &s;cience in which this beloved &s;on had, from the earlie&s;t period of life, been his pupil, and in which they had both gained &s;o great a de|gree of renown. In vain did he encourage, among his men at arms, (for he carried into retirement with him a retinue, which cau&s;ed no little jealou&s;y at court) tho&s;e martial ex|erci&s;es for their courage and dexterity in which the men of that age were renowned. In vain did the court of the ca&s;tle echo daily with the &s;ound of the trumpet.&mdash;In vain were the ban|ners &s;een waving above the battlements. That heart which had &s;o often leaped at the &s;ound of martial mu&s;ic, which owned no charms but tho&s;e which blazed in the front of an em|battled ho&s;t, now &s;hrunk from what it deem|ed a tedious mockery, and &s;ought to indulge its feelings amid the luxury of the mo&s;t gloomy, &s;olitude.</P>
<P>A deep and devious fore&s;t, which flanked the ca&s;tle to the &s;outh, afforded this &s;olitude, and thither did Rhinaldo daily repair to fea&s;t his imagination on the thou&s;and charms with which the image of his I&s;abel was replete.&mdash;His father, who di&s;covered his di&s;like of &s;oci|ety, and probably in &s;ome mea&s;ure gue&s;&s;ed at the cau&s;e of it, forbore, at length, to re&s;train his inclination. They &s;eldom met but at table, (from the ta&s;tele&s;s fe&s;tivity of which Rhmaldo retired as &s;oon as decency would
<PB N="7" REF="028486_0006_0FD922EE1072DC78">
permit him) or at tho&s;e hours when the pub|lic duties of religion &s;ummoned them to the neighbouring convent.</P>
<P>At the&s;e duties Rhinaldo was &s;o con&s;tant, and his attention to them was &s;o rigid and un|deviating, that his father could not forbear entertaining &s;ome fears, that his melancholy would at length enroll him among the religi|ous of the place. Nor were tho&s;e fears enter|tained upon light or frivolous grounds. The &s;ociety con&s;i&s;ted of thirty per&s;ons, who had all borne arms with a con&s;iderable degree of re|putation. The &s;uperior was an old knight, who had led Roderic him&s;elf in the field, and had been his guide in the path of glory, though he was yet, from a youth, inured to toil, and an age fo&s;tered by temperance, vi|gorous and hardy. But the per&s;on, the charms of who&s;e &s;ociety &s;o frequently led the &s;teps of Rhinaldo towards the convent, was an her|mit, who had built his cell hard by, and who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition, truly charitable, had ren|dered him highly re&s;pected, as well by the monks them&s;elves, as by the &s;cattered inha|bitants of the neighbour-hood.</P>
<P>The convent of St. Julian was &s;ituate clo&s;e to Count Roderic's ca&s;tle, on a bold and com|manding eminence.&mdash;Con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of rock, it &s;eemed &s;carcely capable of affording
<PB N="8" REF="028486_0007_0FD922EF55A8C8D8">
nouri&s;hment to the numerous &s;hrubs, who&s;e twi&s;ted roots &s;eemed incorporated with it, and was acce&s;&s;ible only by a winding path of con|&s;iderable length. Steep, rugged and intricate, it was a ta&s;k of con&s;iderable labour to gain the &s;ummit, who&s;e picture&s;que appearance, from the vale below, never failed to incite in the mind an ardent wi&s;h to attain it.</P>
<P>The flinty walls of the convent &s;eemed to have their foundation in air, and its Gothic &s;pires hung over the brow of the rock with an awful magnificence. It overlooked the ca&s;tle. This, as the latter was a place of &s;trength, was a circum&s;tance of importance, and ex|treme care was taken, on any pro&s;pect of an attack, to &s;ecure, this po&s;t, and to afford it ample &s;upplies.</P>
<P>Beneath a projecting part of the cliff, clo&s;e to the winding path already mentioned, and at no great di&s;tance from the &s;ummit, had the hermit, of who&s;e &s;ociety young Rhinaldo was &s;o fond, fixed his abode. His daily care during the period of his re&s;idence in that &s;pot, when the duties of religion had been fulfilled, was to enlarge, amend, and decorate his hum|ble cell, till he had at length formed an ha|bitation, which, for &s;imple beauty and com|fort, the thoughtle&s;s inhabitant of the gay world might envy him.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="028486_0008_0FD922F0D7406C50">
To this retreat, then, did Rhinaldo fly from the cumberous magnificence of Count Roderic's e&s;tabli&s;hment. Here could he me|ditate at lei&s;ure on the virtues and accom|pli&s;hments of his beloved I&s;abel. Here too, (and it was that circum&s;tance which rendered the &s;pot &s;o dear to him) could he confide, without the dread of cold &s;arca&s;m, or har&s;h reproof, the tender &s;ecret of his heart. Father Anthony (for that was the hermit's name) was au&s;tere indeed towards him&s;elf, but, like the holy ma&s;ter, to who&s;e &s;ervice he had now de|voted him&s;elf, he wept over the failings of others.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP II.</HEAD>
<P>SOME months had now pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince Rhi|naldo quitted his command to retire to the Ca&s;tle of his father, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> vi&s;its to the hermitage had grown daily more and more frequent, when one morning at the approach of dawn, he ordered the draw-bridge to be let down, and, attended only by one faithful &s;ervant, took the road which led to the capi|tal. They pa&s;&s;ed the day in tracing the thick and impervious fore&s;t which cloaths for many miles the &s;outhern frontier of that kingdom and the &s;hades of evening overtook them as they gained it's verge. The night &s;et in with
<PB N="10" REF="028486_0009_0FD922F86EA5A680">
unwonted darkne&s;s, and the chill gu&s;t, which began to howl from the north, foretold an approaching tempe&s;t. A few drops of thick rain fell&mdash;the darkne&s;s redoubled&mdash;the di&s;tant thunder began to growl&mdash;Rhinaldo gave his hor&s;e the reins, and tru&s;ting to the &s;agacity of this long-tried favourite for his &s;afety, he proceeded at a &s;low pace, attended by his faithful &s;ervant, catching every now and then a glimp&s;e of the wild &s;cence around, by the gleam of the lightning, which began to dart with almo&s;t unabating rapidity.</P>
<P>Rugiero (&s;o was Rhinaldo's &s;ervant called) &s;topped his hor&s;e &s;uddenly, and called to his ma&s;ter; "&s;urely, my lord," &s;aid he, "by the fla&s;h of the lightning, I ju&s;t now de&s;cried the walls of a man&s;ion."</P>
<P>Rhinaldo &s;topped. Rugiero bade him look to the right, and between &s;ome tall trees he thought he perceived &s;ome ri&s;ing turrets. They turned their hor&s;es, and made &s;lowly and cautiou&s;ly for the &s;pot. As they drew near, they found that their &s;urmi&s;es were true.&mdash;They pur&s;ued their route, and at length with con&s;iderable difficulty, arrived at the gate of an old man&s;ion.</P>
<P>Like mo&s;t of the &s;eats of the nobility in the kingdom, it was &s;urrounded by a maot. Rugiero alighted from his hor&s;e, and &s;lowly
<PB N="11" REF="028486_0010_0FD922FACA416D60">
began to trace the moat round, to di&s;cover, if po&s;&s;ible, a bridge over which they might pa&s;s, and at lea&s;t gain &s;ome &s;helter from the inclemency of the night. He had not pro|ceeded far, before he perceived, on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide, a draw-bridge drawn up, which made him conjecture, that, di&s;olate as the building appeared, (for the walls were in &s;e|veral parts overgrown with thick ivy, and bore every mark, as far as the liget would permit them to be di&s;covered, of great anti|quity) it was inhabited.</P>
<P>He began now to halloo as loud as he could, but with little probability, from the howling of the &s;torm, of making him&s;elf heard. He continued his progre&s;s along the margin of the moat, and Rhinaldo, having alighted from his hor&s;e, &s;lowly followed him.&mdash;They had not proceeded far, before the di&s;covered that this outwork bore as &s;trong marks of decay as the re&s;t of the building, and that the rai&s;ing the draw-bridge at night mu&s;t be more a work of cu&s;tom than utility.</P>
<P>Rugiero, by a very ea&s;y, but broken de|&s;cent, gained the moat, and boldly &s;tepped into it. He found it very &s;hallow, and a&s;|cending upon the ruins which had fallen from a low and crumbling wall on the other &s;ide, he gained the oppo&s;ite bank. He then re|turned to give his ma&s;ter notice of this
<PB N="12" REF="028486_0011_0FD922FC5D8C7400">
cir|cum&s;tance, and to conduct him over. Rhi|naldo did not he&s;itate; taking his hor&s;e in his hand, he followed his &s;ervant. The bea&s;ts &s;prung lightly from the ruins upon the crazy remains of this mouldring bulwark, and the travellers, pa&s;&s;ing &s;lowly round the walls of the hou&s;e, arrived at a large and lofty porch, over-hung with ivy, and midleg deep in the gra&s;s, which grew through the crevices of the &s;tones with which it had been paved. Hav|ing fa&s;tened their hor&s;es to a thorn which grew clo&s;e to one of the pillars, they retired to the extremity of the porch for &s;helter. This &s;helter, however, they did not find&mdash;the rain beat in upon them with violence.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo re&s;olved to try if the door was open. It was not improbable that it &s;hould be &s;o, even if the man&s;ion were inhabited. In a place &s;o de&s;olate, there is little fear of inter|lopers, and the moat and draw-bridge would probably render the dome&s;tics carele&s;s.&mdash;He rai&s;ed a weighty latch, and putting his &s;houl|der again&s;t the door, it opened heavily; and Rhinaldo and his &s;ervant entered. Rhinaldo &s;till held the door in his hand, and firmly per&s;uaded, from every thing he had hitherto witne&s;&s;ed, that the hou&s;e was uninhabited, ordering Rugiero to conduct the hor&s;es into the hall, where he determined to re&s;t for the night.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="028486_0012_0FD92304DB600A98">
Rugiero &s;trenuo&s;ly advi&s;ed him to learn fir&s;t, whether the man&s;ion were actually in|habited or no; and with this advice, upon con&s;ideration, he thought it be&s;t to comply. He hallooed aloud, but the &s;torm &s;eemed to mock his efforts. He walked &s;lowly acro&s;s the hall, but &s;topping &s;uddenly, exclaimed, "Rugiero, are the&s;e your foot&s;teps which I hear?" "No, my Lord," an&s;wered Rugiero, "I have not moved from this &s;pot." "There is &s;omebody," continued Rhinaldo, "a&s;cen|ding a flight of &s;tairs."</P>
<P>He now hallooed again; when a hoar&s;e voice, in a low tone, exclaimed, "peace, fool! are you fit to be tru&s;ted with a &s;ecret of &s;uch importance?" Still all was dark; the &s;ound of the foot&s;teps on the &s;tairca&s;e died gradually away, and left Rhinaldo much per|plexed. "Stay here," &s;aid he, after a pau&s;e, to Rugiero, "till I return,"</P>
<P>Rugiero remon&s;trated, but his ma&s;ter was peremtory, and this attendant had &s;tudied di&s;cipline in a camp. "I will be cautious," &s;aid Rhinaldo, mildly, in order to &s;often the apprehen&s;ions of his faithful &s;ervant. "At all events, your remaining here will &s;ecure us a retreat, &s;hould any thing &s;ini&s;ter occur."</P>
<P>Rhinaldo now advanced, and tracing his way &s;lowly and cautiou&s;ly along the hall,
<PB N="14" REF="028486_0013_0FD92305D87DDA08">
reached at length the &s;tairca&s;e, from which the words, which &s;o much awakened his cu|rio&s;ity, had proceeded. He judged that this &s;tairca&s;e, though now &s;omewhat crazy from age, had once been magnificent. It was ve|ry &s;pacious. He had &s;carcely got half way up it, when he heard foot&s;teps above him, as if of &s;ome per&s;on de&s;cending He &s;tood mo|tionle&s;s, in hopes that, whoever it might be, from the &s;ize of the &s;tairca&s;e they would pa&s;s without detecting him; for the my&s;tery of per&s;ons thus moving in the dark perplexed him even more than the &s;ingular &s;peech he had heard, and he was more than ever anxi|ous to di&s;cover the cau&s;e of it. The foot|&s;teps now &s;eemed advancing towards him; he moved a pace to the right, in order to avoid a meeting, and placed him&s;elf ju&s;t in the way of the per&s;on de&s;cending, who jo&s;tled him. A voice immediately exclaimed, "Ga&s;pard, why do you not &s;peak? You mu&s;t either bawl or be dumb&mdash;the hou&s;e is locked in fleep&mdash;you may now &s;trike a light&mdash;meet me, ten minutes hence, in the refectory."</P>
<P>Rhinaldo was now divided what to do&mdash;when a light, the only one he had yet di&s;co|vered, gleaming dimly from the door of a chamber into a long gallery above, determi|ned him to pur&s;ue his way up the &s;tairca&s;e. He proceeded lightly and cautiou&s;ly. The
<PB N="15" REF="028486_0014_0FD9230AE6EFC600">
light in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> time di&s;appeared, but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the place whence it had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">. He could di&s;cover this place to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> chamber, for though a door <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> opened into a pa&s;&s;age at the farther end of it, he again &s;aw a &s;aint ray of light. He cro&s;&s;ed the chamber, and entered the pa&s;|&s;age, at the farther end of which he ju&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed the legs of a man a&s;cending a nar|row &s;tairca&s;e. He followed with extreme caution, and &s;aw this per&s;on enter a &s;mall room at the top of the &s;tairca&s;e, which &s;ee|med to be a repo&s;itory for very old battered and un&s;erviceable armour, and wornou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> hor&s;e furniture. The per&s;on he had follow|ed pa&s;&s;ed &s;trait to the end of the room, and Rhinaldo gained &s;uch a hight on the &s;tair ca&s;e, as to &s;ee him &s;hove back a pannel of the wain&s;cot which &s;eemed artificially contrived for the purpo&s;e of concealment, and pulling a bunch of keys from his pocket, open a &s;trong ma&s;&s;y door, plated with iron: he then de&s;cended a few &s;teps, &s;hutting it after him and Rhinaldo lo&s;t &s;ight of him.</P>
<P>Perplexed at this circum&s;tance, he advan|ced &s;ome paces towards the iron door. He li&s;tened, and thought he could hear the &s;ound of voices; but it was &s;o indi&s;tinct, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he was left at la&s;t in doubt whether he had not been deceived; and recollecting the con|ver&s;ation

which pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;tairca&s;e, he re&s;olved to return and rejoin Rugiero, with whom perhaps he might di&s;cover what was to be perpetrated in the refectory. He grop|ed his way down again, and at his po&s;t he found his &s;ervant, who the moment he came near him, gra&s;ped his hand, and bade him, in a low wi&s;per, be &s;ilent and watch.</P>
<P>They had not &s;tood many minutes before they perceived a faint light gleam from an arch way on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the hall, and two figures advancing &s;lowly along a pa&s;&s;age, one of whom carried a kind of dark|lanthorn. They perceived them to be men meanly dre&s;&s;ed, and of the mo&s;t unprepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing appearance; one particularly who&s;e profu&s;ion of coar&s;e, long, black hair, was un|plea&s;ingly contra&s;ted with the livid palene&s;s of his countenance, excited Rhinaldo's attention.</P>
<P>In a hoar&s;e and di&s;&s;onant voice, but which Rhinaldo di&s;covered to be the &s;ame which had addre&s;&s;ed him on the &s;tairca&s;e, he exclai|med, "Hark! I heard &s;omething." "'Twas nothing but the wind," replied the other.&mdash;"Hi&s;t!" exclaimed the fir&s;t, and pau&s;ed; "where are the &s;ervants?" "Locked in &s;leep," &s;aid the other.&mdash;They now pla|ced their light on a table ju&s;t within the arch way, and the man who had &s;poke fir&s;t, &s;aid to the other, "why did not you an&s;wer me,
<PB N="17" REF="028486_0016_0FD9230D5BE835F8">
when I met you on the &s;tairca&s;e?" "when?" &s;aid the other. "Ju&s;t now&mdash;within the&s;e ten minutes." "I never met you&mdash;I have not been up &s;tairs."&mdash;"Lyar!" exclaimed the fir&s;t. "May I fall dead this in&s;tant," retur|ned the &s;econd, "if I have left the refectory. Hey! what ails you? you tremble." "No matter," exclaimed the fir&s;t, in a faltering voice. "Give me the bottle." He took a &s;mall wicker bottle from the other, and drank from it. It &s;eemed to revive him. "Give me the lanthorn," &s;aid he, "and the dag|ger." He received from him the dark lan|thorn, and a dagger of &s;ome length, which he &s;tuck in his girdle. "Shall you want me?'! a&s;ked the &s;econd man. "No," &s;aid the fir&s;t; "go&mdash;wait for my lord&mdash;we &s;hall not want you, 'till the body is to be di&s;po&s;ed of."&mdash;"Mercy on us!" cried the &s;econd, in an awful but tremulous tone. The fir&s;t turned &s;hort round upon him, muttered &s;ome|thing between his teeth, and walked &s;lowly acro&s;s the hall towards another pa&s;&s;age, while the &s;econd man moved towards the &s;tairca&s;e, which he a&s;cended.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo and Rugiero, with as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, followed the fir&s;t man; yet they could not proceed &s;o &s;ilently, but that they cau&s;ed him to turn round &s;everal times. The loudne&s;s of the &s;torm, however, deceived
<PB N="18" REF="028486_0017_0FD92312F576D420">
him, and he continued to move forward, through a winding pa&s;&s;age, 'till he &s;topped &s;uddenly at a low arched door, which he opened with a key.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo drew his &s;word, and ru&s;hed for|ward to prevent his &s;hutting it again. This, however, he did not attempt, and Rhinaldo gained the door, ju&s;t as he had placed the lanthorn on the floor, in the middle of a &s;mall vaulted room, and &s;eemed occupied in thought. He &s;tood with his arms folded, and his face turned towards Rhinaldo. Never was a countenance &s;o gha&s;tly and horrid. It betrayed a mo&s;t diabolical agitation of mind. After &s;tanding thus for a few &s;econds, he &s;tooped down, and, feeling along the floor, laid hold of an iron ring, by which, after a few efforts, he pulled up a trap door, and di&s;covered, by the gleam of the lanthorn, a broken flight of &s;teps. He now took up the lanthorn in one hand, and holding the door with the other, began to de&s;cend. Rhi|naldo &s;aw that there was not a moment to be lo&s;t. If this ruffian &s;hould once get beneath the trap-door, the murder he meant to perpe|trate (and of his intention there could not remain a doubt) might be committed in &s;afety.

<P>ASTONISHED at this circum&s;tance, Rhi|naldo pau&s;ed for a few &s;econds; but recollecting that it was po&s;&s;ible the light might not be extingui&s;hed by the fall, he felt for the iron ring, and lifted the trap-door. His conjectures proved to be right&mdash;the lanthorn lay on the floor, cla&s;ped in the hand of the dead man&mdash;and the flame within it was bur|ning the horn. Rugiero picked it up, and having adju&s;ted the candle within it, began to &s;urvey the vault into which they had de&s;|cended.</P>
<P>It was narrow, long, and low; and at the end of it was a very &s;mall arched door-way, and a door apparently very thick, and formi|dably &s;ecured with bolts and bars. Rugiero pu&s;hed the door with his hand, and was &s;ud|denly alarmed by a deep groan from the
<PB N="20" REF="028486_0019_0FD9231722D45220">
place, whatever it might be, to which it open|ed. He had not time, however, to ruminate long on this circum&s;tance; his ma&s;ter called to him in a very low voice from the other end of the vault, and when he came near, made him a &s;ign to li&s;ten; he did &s;o, and heard di&s;tinctly the foot&s;teps of a man walk|ing in a ha&s;ty and agitated &s;tep over their heads. Every now and then he pau&s;ed, as if to li&s;ten to &s;omething; and after a few minutes, they heard exclaiming in a low tone "Fabian!"</P>
<P>This was repeated &s;everal times;&mdash;and Rhinaldo at length perceiving that it was ad|dre&s;&s;ed towards the vault, an&s;wered in as hol|low a voice as he could a&s;&s;ume, "Here!"</P>
<P>"Is it done?" exclaimed the unknown per&s;on from above. "It is," an&s;wered Rhi|naldo. "'Tis well," re&s;umed the voice from above. "Convey the body into the vaulted room&mdash;lay it out on the table, and cover it with the mantle which I &s;hall &s;end you."&mdash;They then heard the &s;teps of this per&s;on mov|ing towards the door, and the &s;ound of them &s;oon died away.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo, who now grew more anxious than ever to di&s;cover this my&s;tery, took his re&s;olution on the &s;pot, and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance

of Rugiero, &s;tripping the doublet and cloak from the body of the man he had killed, he put them on, pulling his hair over his face, and di&s;gui&s;ing him&s;elf as artfully as he could with the blood which &s;till flowed from the wound he had inflicted. He then put on Rugieros's hat, which being much plainer than his own, was well calculated to give ad|ditional concealment to his countenance; and, within the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this &s;teady and faithful dome&s;tic, lifting the trap-door, con|veyed the body into the vaulted cham<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er a|bove, and &s;tretched it on the table as directed.</P>
<P>This done, they prepared to &s;ecure the me&s;&s;enger who &s;hould be &s;ent with the man|tle, and who they judged would prove the per&s;on they had before &s;een in company with the man who was &s;lain. In order to effect this, Rugiero, drawing his &s;word, placed him&s;elf clo&s;e to the door of the room, ju&s;t within the portal, while his ma&s;ter &s;tood at the front of the table, on which the body was placed, and &s;o much in front of the lanthorn, which he had contrived &s;hould throw but a dim gleam of light, that a per&s;on entering the room, could only di&s;tingui&s;h the figure of a man, but was not enabled to di&s;cover who, or what he might be.</P>

<P>He had &s;carcely uttered the&s;e words, be|fore Rugiero, advancing from the door, &s;eized him by the collar, and Rhinaldo do|ing the &s;ame, the fellow fell down &s;peechle&s;s with horror.

<P>At a table, on which was placed a dim lamp and a cru&s;ifix, he could perceive a lady richly dre&s;t. Her elbow re&s;ted on the table, and her cheek on her hand. She was read|ing.

He then proceeded down the &s;teps, The lady ca&s;t her eyes towards him as he entered, threw them with a &s;uppli|cating look towards heaven, and again fixed them on her book.</P>
<P>He advanced &s;lowly into the room, and beckening the lady, in a &s;tern tone of voice ordered her to follow him.</P>
<P>"What more am I to &s;uffer?" &s;aid &s;he. "What farther &s;cene of &s;avage cruelty am I to witne&s;s?"</P>
<P>He beckened Rhinaldo and his companion into the room. The lady &s;tarted wildly when &s;he &s;aw them. "Nay," &s;aid &s;he, "if I am to be murdered, perpetrate your crime on this &s;pot."&mdash;Saying this, &s;he &s;eized the cruci|fix; cla&s;ped it to her bo&s;om, and fell on her

knees before the book, which lay open on the table. The per&s;on who had cau&s;ed this a|larm then took her under one arm, and mak|ing a &s;ign to Rhinaldo to do the &s;ame by the other, &s;he &s;uffered her&s;elf to be conducted, without a murmur, whither&s;oever they &s;hould choo&s;e, &s;till holding the crucifix in her hand.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo, &s;truck with compa&s;&s;ion at the &s;ituation of this lady, was repeatedly tempted to whi&s;per comfort in her ear; but he thought a premature di&s;covery of his de&s;ign might in all prabability baffle every attempt he might make to &s;erve her; he therefore proceeded, holding her &s;till by the arm, 'till they gained the vaulted chamber, when the per&s;on who had conducted her to it thus addre&s;&s;ed her: "Adultere&s;s!"&mdash;She rai&s;ed her&s;elf from the arm of Rhinaldo. "Mon&s;ter!" &s;aid &s;he, "at lea&s;t, &s;pare my fame&mdash;thou knowe&s;t the fal&s;|hood of that in&s;inuation."&mdash;"That mantle,"&mdash;&s;aid he, pointing to that which lay over the body of Fabian, "was the work of your hands, and de&s;igned doubtle&s;s as a pre&s;ent to me." "Never,"&mdash;an&s;wered the lady,&mdash;"heaven knows.&mdash;They to who&s;e power it was my lot to bow, knew too well that it was not de&s;igned for thee."</P>
<P>"Perhaps," returned he, with an air of

the mo&s;t &s;avage triumph, "it was de&s;igned for him who now wears it." At this the lady &s;tarted&mdash;&s;he looked wild with apprehen&s;ion and terror&mdash;&s;he advanced towards the table&mdash;&s;he cla&s;ped her hands together, and eagerly looked on the mantle&mdash;"It cannot be," &s;aid &s;he&mdash;"you are not &s;uch a mon&s;ter." The man advanced, and with a barbarous readi|ne&s;s, &s;eized the taper which his attendant carried, and held it before her. "Lift up the mantle, &s;aid he, to Rhinaldo. Rhinaldo lifted it, fixing his eyes full upon him, and di&s;covered the body of Fabian.</P>
<P>"Good heavens!" cried the lady; "what can all this mean?" She &s;taggered &s;ome paces back, and was caught in the arms of Rugiero, who had advanced to be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t his ma&s;ter upon occa&s;ion.&mdash;The man him&s;elf &s;eemed petrified with a&s;toni&s;hment upon &s;eeing the corp&s;e&mdash;in a few &s;econds he drew his &s;word.</P>
<P>"Con&s;ummate villain!" &s;aid he; and he flew at Rhinaldo. Rhinaldo, who watched his eye, drew at the &s;ame time, beat down the thru&s;t which was made, with extreme ra|pidity, at his brea&s;t, and, returning it, buried his &s;word in his adver&s;ary's body; but per|ceived, on recovering his guard, that he was him&s;elf wounded in the thigh; he, however,
<PB N="27" REF="028486_0026_0FD92333508D7CE0">
advanced towards the lady, and &s;eeing her &s;omewhat recovered, attempted to explain to her that the per&s;on for who&s;e life &s;he &s;eemed to labour under &s;uch apprehen&s;ions, was pro|bably &s;afe&mdash;out he poured this intelligence into a deaf ear. Harra&s;&s;ed to death by the cruelties of her oppre&s;&s;or, and the &s;cene &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed, &s;he &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible to all a|round her.&mdash;Rhinaldo and Rugiero con|ducted her &s;lowly to the apartment in which they had found her, and placed her on the bed.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo then inquired whether there were any female &s;ervants in the hou&s;e, and hearing that there were two, he went, attended by the companion of the decea&s;ed Fabian, to a|waken them, and in a &s;hort time procured their attendance on the lady.</P>
<P>After taking care that every po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance &s;hould be given to her, Rhinaldo turned his thoughts once more towards the vaulted chamber, and leaving the lady under the pro|tection of his faithful Rugiero, he ordered Ga&s;pard (for &s;o was Fabian's comrade called) to attend him; and again proceeded down the &s;tairs, determined to explore the vault, in which the mi&s;creant, he had &s;o lately pu|ni&s;hed, had met the reward of his iniquities.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="028486_0027_0FD923346FEC66F0">
As they entered the room, the fir&s;t object that &s;truck them was the body of the per&s;on who had ju&s;t fallen by Rhinaldo's &s;word. Rhinaldo held the taper to his face, and con|templating his features, though now fixed by the agonies of death,&mdash;"Is not this," &s;aid he, to Ga&s;pard, "the Lord of St. Amand?" Ga&s;pard an&s;wered in the affirmative. Rhi|naldo felt the body; but no &s;igns of life re|mained. He then ordered Ga&s;pard to rai&s;e the trap-door, and followed him into the vault. They proceeded along this dreary &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age, 'till they came to the little door at the end. This, after &s;ome la|bour, they unbolted, for the fa&s;tenings were numerous and &s;trong, and de&s;cending by a narrow broken &s;tairca&s;e, entered as di&s;mal a dungeon, as the mo&s;t gloomy imagination could pourtray.</P>
<P>In one corner they de&s;cribed the figure of a man, &s;eated on a large &s;tone, to which he was chained. As they opened the door, he ca&s;t a languid eye towards them, and exclaim|ed, "I &s;hall at la&s;t then find an end to my mi&s;eries! Do not fear to perform your com|mi&s;&s;ion&mdash;but, if you have any compa&s;&s;ion left, bear the ring which you will find in my bo&s;om to the wi&s;e of your lord."</P>
<P>Rhinaldo advanced towards him.&mdash;<Q>Have
<PB N="29" REF="028486_0028_0FD9233B328CF2D0">

<P>The pri&s;oner leaped in &s;urpri&s;e from his &s;eat, but, re&s;trained by his chains, he &s;unk down again. "Know ye not Rhinaldo?" &s;aid the young knight, and &s;prung forward to embrace him. The pri&s;oner folded his arms about his friend; but the &s;urpri&s;e proved too much for him, and he &s;unk &s;peechle&s;s on Rhinaldo's bo&s;om. In a little time, however, he recovered him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Gracious heaven!" exclaimed he, <Q>to meet Rhinaldo in the place of my execu|tioner.</Q> "Let us rid you," &s;aid Rhi|naldo, "of the&s;e chains." The chains which &s;ecured him were fa&s;tened by a &s;trong bolt round each leg. Rhinaldo thought that if his boots were cut off, the link would prove large enough to &s;lip over his foot. He a&s;ked Ga&s;pard for a knife, who went in &s;earch of one, but in a&s;cending the &s;tairs, found the dagger of Fabian, which had dropped from his girdle as he fell; with this he returned. Count Tancred's boots were &s;lit down and taken off, but the link was &s;maller than they
<PB N="30" REF="028486_0029_0FD9233C9E43C1C8">
had &s;uppo&s;ed&mdash;it was nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be unlocked or filed.</P>
<P>Ga&s;pard then told Rhinaldo, that the key of the Count's fetters was probably in Fa|bian's pocket, which was immediately &s;earch|ed, and Count Tancred, who&s;e impatience would only &s;uffer them to unlock the link which fa&s;tened him to the &s;tone, wrapt his chains round his arm, and followed his friend out of the dungeon. His mind was agitated by a mo&s;t in &s;atiable curio&s;ity&mdash;he a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions on a moment. "I will lead you,"&mdash;&s;aid Rhinaldo, "to one who will a&s;&s;i&s;t me in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> detail&mdash;for, to &s;ay the truth, I am, at pre&s;ent, rather weary."</P>
<P>Rhinaldo was at this time accompanying his friend up the &s;teps of the vault. "You look faint," &s;aid Count Tancred;&mdash;"You bleed too, my friend!" They reached the vaulted chamber, where the Count was final|ly freed from his fetters.</P>
<P>"Here," &s;aid Rhinaldo, "lie your foes." Tancred &s;urveyed the bodies.</P>
<P>"Mercile&s;s barbarian!" &s;aid he, as he contemplated that of the Count;&mdash;"Why was not thy puni&s;hment re&s;erved for me? But Rhinaldo," continued he, in a faltering

voice, "there is&mdash;a&mdash;beauteous and wretch|ed victim&mdash;"</P>
<P>Rhinaldo threw him&s;elf into a chair. "I feel," &s;aid he, "too much embarra&s;&s;ed, by a &s;light wound I have received, to accompa|ny you up &s;tairs.&mdash;This per&s;on will conduct you where your que&s;tion will be more effica|ciou&s;ly re&s;olved; but &s;tay&mdash;it will be proper, perhaps, to &s;ecure the fidelity of your guide&mdash;&s;o &s;aying, Rhinaldo pointed to the &s;word of the Count de St. Amand, which lay on the floor.

<P>Count Tancred now quitted Rhinaldo, and, under the direction of Ga&s;pard, &s;ought the apartment of the lady. Rhinaldo had not been left many minutes in the vaulted cham|ber, before Rugiero attended him. He ex|amined the wound in his thigh, and found it &s;light indeed; but by &s;ub&s;equent irritation much inflamed.

<P>Rugiero, after conducting his ma&s;ter up &s;tairs, who found Count Tancred and the lady in a more convenient apartment than that in which &s;he had been confined, to which the women, who had been called to attend her, had humanity enough to remove her, went to &s;eek for his hor&s;e, and having found both his own and that of his ma&s;ter under the porch, from which they had not moved, he &s;et off by the light of the dawn, which ju&s;t now began to appear, in &s;earch of &s;ome place in which he might find provender for them: His eye &s;oon directed him to a building, re|&s;embling a &s;table, which was in many places unroofed, but which &s;till afforded a tolerable &s;helter. He led his hor&s;es gently in his hand, and opening the door, di&s;covered that he had not been deceived. In this &s;table he found a man occupied in &s;addling a hor&s;e.

<P>Rugiero clapped his hand to his &s;word, and the man &s;eizing the hor&s;e ha&s;tily by the bridle, drew him, un&s;addled as he was, out at an oppo&s;ite door. Rugiero, encumbered with two hor&s;es, knew not readily what to do. In an in&s;tant, however, he quitted them both, and ru&s;hed on foot through the door at which this per&s;on had &s;led.

<P>Rugiero, at fir&s;t, thought of pur&s;uing the fugitive, and ha&s;tened back for his hor&s;e; but, upon a little reflection, he gave up this de&s;ign. His hor&s;e was exhau&s;ted with fa|tigue, and the want of provender, while that of the fugitive was probably fre&s;h. It would, be&s;ides, be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to trace him in a wild &s;o trackle&s;s and de&s;erted as the fore&s;t;
<PB N="35" REF="028486_0034_0FD92350F6FC7A20">
he therefore contented him&s;elf with &s;earching the &s;tables for provender, which, having ob|tained, he placed before his ma&s;ter's hor&s;e and his own, and returned once more into the hou&s;e to acquaint Rhinaldo with the cir|cum&s;tance which had ju&s;t occurred.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing the door, an impul&s;e, which he could not re&s;i&s;t, induced him fir&s;t to turn in|to the vaulted chamber, and he there ima|gined he di&s;covered cau&s;e of the &s;ingular cir|cum&s;tance which had ju&s;t occurred. He found the body of the Count de St. Amand removed from the middle of the room, where he had left it, to a corner clo&s;e under the window, which was opened to admit the light of the dawn, probably from the purpo&s;e of contemplating the face of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>He had now little doubt but that one of the &s;ervants had, during the period in which he conducted Rhinaldo up &s;tairs, entered the vaulted chamber, and di&s;covered the death of the Count St. Amand.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance, as he judged, was of extreme importance to the &s;afety of his ma|&s;ter, and he ha&s;tened to inform Rhinaldo of it, who gave him full credit for the fidelity of his attachment towards him, but conti|nued to urge him &s;trongly to ha&s;ten his de|parture.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="028486_0035_0FD923531CD69950">
Rugiero, therefore, returned to the &s;table, and his hor&s;e being &s;omewhat refre&s;hed, he led him to the drawbridge, and letting it down, pa&s;&s;ed over it, directing his cour&s;e to|wards that part of the fore&s;t from which he judged that his ma&s;ter and him&s;elf had de|viated, when the &s;torm had compelled them to &s;eek refuge in the man&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Counte&s;s St. Amand, for &s;uch, by the reproaches of the Count, Rhinal|do perceived her to be, was now much reco|vered from the recent indi&s;po&s;ition which the horrors of the night had cau&s;ed. Though &s;he could not but feel deeply and awfully im|pre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ingular events which had ta|ken place, &s;he did not affect any extraordi|nary degree of concern for the death of a man, who&s;e cruel and ferocious di&s;po&s;ition had rendered him the dete&s;tation of all who knew him; her health indeed &s;eemed to have been impaired by the inhuman conduct of this barbarian towards her, and the ro&s;es had faded in her cheek. She was, however, notwith&s;tanding this, extremely beautiful;
<PB N="37" REF="028486_0036_0FD923582E54E6A0">
and the benevolence of her heart was con|&s;picuous in the gratitude which &s;he did not cea&s;e to expre&s;s towards her deliverer. The concern &s;he felt at hearing of his wound, could &s;carcely be &s;oothed by the tender atten|tion of Tancred, nor by the repeated a&s;&s;ur|ances of Rhinaldo him&s;elf, that the wound was trifling, and that he had a thorough con|fidence in the &s;kill of his dome&s;tic, which he had in &s;ome &s;imilar in&s;tances previou&s;ly ex|perienced.</P>
<P>The day now completely dawned, and the Counte&s;s propo&s;ed to Tancred and Rhinaldo, that they &s;hould take &s;ome repo&s;e after the fatigues they had undergone; but the intelli|gence which they had recently received from Rugiero, of the e&s;cape of the &s;ervant, was of too &s;erious a nature to permit them, for the pre&s;ent, to enjoy a thought of repo&s;e; and anxious as they &s;everally were to have the wonderful events of the night explained to them, they were compelled to delay the gra|tification of their curio&s;ity, and con&s;ult toge|ther on the mea&s;ures to be pur&s;ued in a mo|ment &s;o pregnant with danger to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Rugiero, in the mean time, pur&s;ued his journey with as much &s;peed as po&s;&s;ible, and arrived, without meeting any extraordinary adventure, at the capital. He reached the
<PB N="38" REF="028486_0037_0FD923593279F388">
hou&s;e of Bernard Tilly, and, having put up his hor&s;e, waited, not without anxiety, for the eventful hour of twelve. The clock from the neighbouring convent at length &s;truck, and Rugiero &s;natching up his cloak and his &s;word, ha&s;tened towards the high bridge. He found, as he pa&s;&s;ed, the &s;treets de&s;erted. The inhabitants had all retired to bed&mdash;he gained the high bridge, and as he advanced towards the center of it, he di&s;covered a man wrapt in a cloak, walking with a &s;low and thought|ful pace towards him. This man pa&s;&s;ed Ru|giero, without &s;eeming to notice him; when Rugiero, according to his in&s;tructions, put to him the que&s;tion&mdash;"YES or NO?" The man an&s;wered immediately, "NO;" and wrapping his cloak about him, quickened his pace, and proceeded forward, without &s;o much as look|ing at Rugiero.</P>
<P>Rugiero followed him through &s;everal winding &s;treets, 'till he turned into a pa&s;&s;age &s;o narrow that it involved them in compleat darkne&s;s. Rugiero continued, however, to follow the man, 'till the pa&s;&s;age opened into a kind of &s;quare, which appeared to be in a &s;tate of de&s;olation. The ground was rough, uneven, and full of hillocks. Their path was interrupted by fragments of &s;tone, bricks, and rubbi&s;h; and the &s;tench which aro&s;e around them, betrayed it to be the re&s;idence of the
<PB N="39" REF="028486_0038_0FD9235E9FA07F20">
meane&s;t and mo&s;t wretched inhabitants of the metropolis.</P>
<P>They at la&s;t reached a &s;tone building, &s;eem|ingly of very ancient &s;tructure, the entrance to which was a gothic door, &s;o low that a moderate &s;ized man mu&s;t &s;toop con&s;iderably at entering it, and very narrow.</P>
<P>At this door the man tapped gently, and a &s;mall grated wicket in the middle of it was immediately unlocked.&mdash;Some words in a low voice pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;the door opened, as far as a chain, which was placed acro&s;s it on the in&s;ide, would permit&mdash;and two men, with drawn daggers, appeared as centinels on the in&s;ide, Rugiero and his conductor were ad|mitted&mdash;they pa&s;&s;ed under the chain, and the door was immediately clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed through a long winding pa&s;|&s;age, and up a narrow flight of &s;tone &s;tairs, at the top of which they tapped at a door, and were admitted into a large, gloomy, and almo&s;t unfurni&s;hed room, illuminated by a &s;ingle lamp, which hung over a table.</P>
<P>Several men, who&s;e per&s;ons could not, on account of the gloomy light which the lamp diffu&s;ed, be very accurately di&s;tingui&s;hed, were walking about the room, conver&s;ing
<PB N="40" REF="028486_0039_0FD92361E958B398">
with each other. When Rugiero was ad|mitted, his guide approached them, and hav|ing &s;aid &s;omething to them in a low voice, pa&s;&s;ed out of a door at the farther end of the room, and in a few minutes returned, accom|panied by a gentleman with a taper in his hand, who advanced ha&s;tily towards Rugie|ro; but &s;topped &s;hort when he had approached near enough to di&s;tingui&s;h him, and &s;aid, with &s;igns of di&s;appointment, "how is this? Is not your lord here?"</P>
<P>Rugiero, who knew him to be a young nobleman bound by the &s;tricte&s;t ties of friend|&s;hip to his lord, explained to him &s;hortly the accident which had prevented Rhinaldo's ar|rival; but added, mode&s;tly, that whatever &s;ervice they might think proper to employ him in, he hoped and tru&s;ted he &s;hould go through it with firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>"I do not doubt it," &s;aid the nobleman: <Q>but your lord's coun&s;el and conduct on a day like this&mdash;his ab&s;ence affects us&mdash;it is, as it were, a limb lobbed from our en|terpri&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>He then turned towards the remainder of the company, and entered into a long con|ver&s;ation with them.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="028486_0040_0FD9236515939710">
Rugiero, by the light of the taper, which this gentleman had brought, added to that of the lamp, had an opportunity of viewing more di&s;tinctly the figures of the&s;e per&s;ons. They &s;eemed all armed and accoutred for im|mediate &s;ervice. The nobleman who addre&s;&s;ed him, though not completely armed, had on his cuira&s;&s;e, and other pieces, which were not &s;ufficiently cumberous to prevent his act|ing on foot.</P>
<P>After having conver&s;ed for &s;ome time with the re&s;t, this nobleman turned to Rugiero, and bade him follow him. They pa&s;&s;ed through the door at the end of the room, and arrived at a &s;mall chamber, in which there was a common truckle bed and two chairs.</P>
<P>"This," &s;aid the nobleman, &s;miling, "is my apartment. But come," added he, "let us lo&s;e no time" He pa&s;&s;ed through this a|partment, and de&s;cending by a &s;tairca&s;e on the other &s;ide of it, entered a room, in which were &s;everal armed men, &s;ome walking, &s;ome &s;itting down, and others lying on benches. Several pieces of armour hung round the walls, and &s;words and pikes &s;eemed &s;cattered carele&s;sly about.</P>
<P>"Come, my friends," &s;aid the nobleman, as he entered&mdash;"our hour is arrived;"
<PB N="42" REF="028486_0041_0FD9236562713ED8">
twelve of them then took up their arms, and the nobleman, followed by Rugiero, led them to the gate at which the latter had entered, which was opened at their approach.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed over the ruins, and keeping the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence, gained the new bridge. They did not pa&s;s over it, but pa&s;&s;ing down on one &s;ide of the river, di&s;covered at no great di&s;tance a boat, in which &s;ate two men.</P>
<P>The&s;e men aro&s;e at their approach, and the nobleman having &s;aid &s;omething to them, addre&s;&s;ed Rugiero as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t now leave you, as my pre&s;ence is demanded el&s;ewhere. The&s;e men will con|duct you to the garden at the back of the pa|lace&mdash;there, if fortune befriends us, you will find the prince&s;s I&s;abel. This will prove an eventful night. Your ta&s;k will probably require fortitude and pre&s;ence of mind. If you have the good fortune to effect the e&s;cape of the prince&s;s, convey her with all &s;peed to the place whence we now came."</P>
<P>Saying this, the nobleman, with four of his comrades, departed, leaving Rugiero with the re&s;t, who immediately embarked in the boat prepared for them. Rugiero now per|ceived
<PB N="43" REF="028486_0042_0FD923692D4B5A28">
that the two men in the boat were al|&s;o armed.</P>

<P>THEY dropped &s;ilently down with the tide, rowing as gently as po&s;&s;ible, le&s;t the da&s;hing of their oars, amid the &s;tillne&s;s of the night, &s;hould create &s;ome alarm.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the back of the pa|lace gardens, which opened by a beautiful and lofty terrace towards the river. They were &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;ound of many voices, and could faintly di&s;cover &s;everal per&s;ons moving on the terrace. They now took in their oars entirely, and as the tide carried them &s;lowly oppo&s;ite the terrace, pre&s;erved the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence.&mdash;They did not, however, execute this &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, as not to be perceived. They were challenged from the terrace, and ordered to bring to. In &s;pite, however of this order, they &s;till continued to drop down with the tide, about the middle of the channel, when they were alarmed by the report of an arquebu&s;&s;e, evidently levelled at them; the &s;hot, however, probably went
<PB N="44" REF="028486_0043_0FD9236BD779C7E8">
over their heads, as they did not perceive a|ny effect from it. They now thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary again to ply their oars, which they did with &s;ome effect, but remitted their la|bour upon hearing a bugle &s;ound in the gar|den, at the call of which the &s;oldiers, whom they had &s;een upon the terrace, &s;uddenly di&s;|appeared, and left the gardens wrapt in total &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Rugiero, upon this, re&s;olved to land there, and ordering the boat to pull in gently to|wards the terrace, he threw a ladder of ropes, with which the boatmen were purpo&s;ely pro|vided, over the parapet; but the breadth of the wall prevented the grapplings, which were fixed to the end of the ladder, taking hold. They then pu&s;hed the boat towards a large flight of &s;tone &s;tairs, which de&s;cended from a magnificent portico about the centre of the terrace, and entangling their grapp|lings with &s;ome wrought iron which united the gateway with the parapet, Rugiero a&s;|cended the ladder, and was followed by the whole of his party, except the two per&s;ons he had found in the boat, who &s;till remained to take care of it. They paced &s;ilently along the terrace, and &s;aught the mo&s;t retired part of the garden, intending to conceal them|&s;elves in the bowers with which it abounded.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="028486_0044_0FD923715672EAF0">
They had not proceeded for, before they di&s;covered two women, who pa&s;&s;ed &s;wiftly between the trees. Terror &s;eemed to lend them wings. Rugiero and his party had &s;carcely time to ob&s;erve them, before they &s;aw their progre&s;s impeded by a party of ar|med men, who&s;e leader, advancing towards the women, laid hold on the foremo&s;t of them by the arm, while his party &s;urround|ed them.</P>
<P>Rugiero, who immediately conjectered that this mu&s;t be the lady I&s;abel, ordered his men to &s;tand to their arms, and advanced re|&s;olutely towards them. The women &s;hriek|ed, and Rugiero heard the leader of the op|po&s;ite band exclaim, "It is the lady I&s;abel&mdash;&s;ecure her."</P>
<P>Upon hearing this, Rugiero ru&s;hed on him, and was re&s;olutely &s;econded by his men, one of whom gently led the women towards the terrace, while the re&s;t, placing their backs towards them, in a firm phalanx, covered the retreat. In this manner they gained the ter|race; but the exclamations of the oppo&s;ite party, who called loudly for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the cla&s;hing of their &s;words, had by this time &s;o far increa&s;ed the number of their enemies, that though they had gained the portico at which the ladder was &s;u&s;pended, the found
<PB N="46" REF="028486_0045_0FD923740D141D30">
them&s;elves &s;o pre&s;&s;ed, that they began to give up every hope of e&s;cape. They had found means, however, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the men below, to convey the two women &s;afe|ly to the boat, and calling to tho&s;e below to pu&s;h off, had no thoughts but of &s;elling their lives as dearly as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;when the attention of the foe was &s;uddenly diverted by a violent attack on the gate of the portico, and in an in&s;tant Rugiero found his little forlorn party &s;uccoured by a &s;trong reinforcement, who mounted the terrace by the rope ladder, which &s;till hung &s;u&s;pended to the iron work of the portico.</P>
<P>The gate in a &s;hort time was opened by a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from the in&s;ide, and a con&s;iderable party, who had di&s;embarked from boats which lay moored to the &s;tone &s;tairca&s;e below, ru&s;hed at once into the garden. The enemy found it in vain to contend longer, and made a pre|cipitate retreat, in which they were clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed by the party which had ju&s;t arrived.</P>
<P>Rugiero, who had luckily (though very hardly pre&s;&s;ed) e&s;caped without a wound, was now preparing to de&s;cend the ladder, in order to &s;ecure the retreat of the Lady I&s;abel, when he was acco&s;ted by a per&s;on belonging to the party ju&s;t entered, who, calling him by his name, a&s;ked him, if the lady was &s;afe?</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="028486_0046_0FD923771518B9F0">
Rugiero knew this per&s;on immediately to be the nobleman he had &s;o lately quitted, and his &s;urpri&s;e at this unexpected meeting kept him for a moment &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"We have been betrayed," added this nobleman. "Our troops have met with a warm reception in the &s;quare, and I have embarked with this re&s;erve to try whether this part of the palace would not prove le&s;s impregnable than the front; but where," con|tinued he, "is the lady I&s;abel?"</P>
<P>Rugiero told him that &s;he was in the boat below, and he de&s;cended immediately by the ladder. In about five minutes he returned. "Rugiero," &s;aid he, "we have been decei|ved.&mdash;The lady in the boat is not the Lady I&s;abel; &s;he is, however, a lady, in who&s;e welfare I intere&s;t my&s;elf much. The duty of the moment will not permit me to &s;tay&mdash;the Lady I&s;abel is confined in her chamber in the fir&s;t &s;tory on the left front of the we&s;tern tower. I will leave a tru&s;ty few for the guard of the boat, and with thirty more, whom I will &s;pare to reinforce your detachement, you mu&s;t attempt to re&s;cue the lady" Having remained ju&s;t long enough to effect this arran|gement, the nobleman ha&s;tened towards the palace.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="028486_0047_0FD9237D07F22E00">
Rugiero now took the command of the men who were delivered to him by the nobleman, and &s;ought the we&s;tern tower. He perceived the window on the left front&mdash;it was about the height of two pikes from the ground, and grated with iron&mdash;he perceived that the cham|ber within was lighted up; he had taken the precaution to bring from the boat the ladder of ropes; he tied two pikes together and hoi&s;t|ing the ladder, fixed the grapplings to the bars of the windows and a&s;cended. The light in the chamber grew every moment more and more vived. What were the horrors which Rugiero felt when, upon gaining the window, he perceived the furniture and hangings of the chamber enveloped in flames.</P>
<P>He had &s;carcely time to reflect on this dreadful &s;pectacle, before he heard the cla&s;hing of &s;words, and perceived that his men were attacked below.&mdash;The garden was again in tumult, and the party which had lately landed were compelled to retreat to their boats, which they did in much confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Rugiero's guard &s;tood boldly on their de|fence, but were pre&s;ently overpowered by numbers, and compelled to &s;eek their &s;afety with the re&s;t. In this confu&s;ion Rugiero &s;tood &s;upported by the gratings of the window, 'till the flames began to crack the panes of the
<PB N="49" REF="028486_0048_0FD9237DD6101240">
ca&s;ement, and his po&s;t was become too hot to be longer tenable. He now began to de|&s;cend, when, either from the melting of the &s;older, through the increa&s;ing heat of the walls, or from the rottenne&s;s of the ironwork it&s;elf, the grating gave way, and Rugiero fell to the ground.</P>
<P>He lay, for &s;ome time, &s;tunned by his fall, and upon recovering him&s;elf, found that the tumult in the garden had in a great mea&s;ure &s;ub&s;ided. He had luckily received no mate|rial damage from this accident, and now thought of effecting his e&s;cape; but reflecting for a moment on his &s;ituation, he judged it u&s;ele&s;s to proceed towards the terrace, as the boats had probably by this time quitted the &s;hore.</P>
<P>As he walked &s;lowly forwards, doubtful what he &s;hould do, he perceived before him the body of a man, who had probably been &s;lain in the late &s;kirmi&s;h, and who was dre&s;t in the habit of the king's guard.</P>
<P>Rugiero he&s;itated not a moment, but &s;trip|ping him of his hat, his buff coat, and ban|delier, and placing his arquebu&s;&s;e on his &s;houlder, he fell in with a party who were in an irregular manner retiring towards the palace, and in&s;inuating him&s;elf among them,
<PB N="50" REF="028486_0049_0FD92381F88085F8">
&s;oon gained the great &s;quare in the front of the building.</P>
<P>He there found mo&s;t of the troops in the city drawn up, and under arms, while a par|ty were employed in extingui&s;hing the fire which had filled his mind with &s;o much hor|ror.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ing on the dreadful fate which had probably attended the unfortunate lady, for who&s;e &s;ake &s;olely he &s;eemed to have been commanded on his pre&s;ent &s;ervice, and &s;hud|dering at the bare idea of cummunicating to his lord intelligence &s;o pregnant with calam|ity, he quitted the &s;quare, unperceived by &s;ome &s;entries who were po&s;ted at the differnet aven|ues, but who were employed in drinking, and gained the high bridge. From the high bridge, he &s;trove to retrace his former &s;teps towards the &s;pot on which he had fir&s;t &s;een the noble friend of his lord. In this he &s;uc|ceeded; but, on his arrival, he had fre&s;h cau&s;e for a&s;toni&s;hment and alarm. He &s;aw the ruins allmo&s;t covered with dead bodies&mdash;a large party of the king's troops were &s;till there under arms&mdash;the building, at the little door of which he had been &s;o cautiou&s;ly ad|mitted, was &s;moaking in ruins, and, oppo&s;ite to it, were placed two &s;mall pieces of artil|lery. In &s;hort, there was every appearance
<PB N="51" REF="028486_0050_0FD9238315193AD8">
that this hou&s;e had been defended to the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>Rugiero retired with a melancholy &s;tep from this &s;cene of &s;laughter, and regaining the hou&s;e of Bernard Tilly, he mounted his hor&s;e, and prepared to convey to his ma&s;ter the heavy and heart-breaking intelligence with which he felt his mind oppre&s;&s;ed. At the ea&s;tern gate, through which it was nece&s;|&s;ary that he &s;hould attempt his e&s;cape, he judged that he &s;hould not be able to pa&s;s without &s;ome difficulty&mdash;He re&s;olved, howe|ver, to depend on the coat he wore, and the tale he &s;hould be able to fabricate, in all proba|bility this would &s;carcely have &s;ucceeded; but he was not put to the trial&mdash;he found the po&s;t de&s;erted&mdash;the guard had been recently attacked, and the gate forced&mdash;he now took the road towards the place where he had left Rhinaldo.</P>

<P>RUGIERO rode on, wrapt in mournful meditation, 'till he came to the &s;kirts of a wood. As he entered the hollow way, which led through this wood, he heard a noi&s;e of the galloping of hor&s;es at a di&s;tance behind him. He turned round, and percei|ved a troop of hor&s;men&punc; at the di&s;tance of a|bout a quarter of a mile, pre&s;&s;ing with all their &s;peed towards him.</P>
<P>As he did not think it prudent to encoun|ter the&s;e men, he put his hor&s;e forward, and perceiving a narrow path winding through the thicket on his right hand, he turned his hor&s;e into it, and giving him the &s;pur, and defended his face as well as he could with his hand, he &s;peedily lo&s;t &s;ight of the road. He pur&s;ued the path, which became gradually more open, 'till thinking him&s;elf well con|cealed from the hor&s;men, who&s;e approach had alarmed him, he pau&s;ed. He had the &s;atisfaction to hear them pa&s;s along the read, without attempting to turn out of it. He then thought of returning the way he came,

but perceived the thicket &s;o deeply entang|led, that he was compelled to pur&s;ue the path &s;trait forward.</P>
<P>It extended gradually, as he proceeded, 'till it opened into a green &s;ward, &s;haped like a little amphitheatre, and &s;urrounded, on all &s;ides, by the wood. As he entered this place, he perceived the back of a man, who was gliding through the trees at the other end of it. He &s;topped his hor&s;e when he per|ceived this, and, as he was meditating on the path he &s;hould pur&s;ue, he was &s;urrounded by four men, who ru&s;hed out of the &s;urround|ing thickets &s;o &s;uddenly, that they had &s;eized upon his bridle and &s;word before he was a|ware of their approach.</P>
<P>They told him he was their pri&s;oner, and, bidding him di&s;mount, tied his hands behind him, and led him through the thicke&s;t of the underwood,&mdash;his hor&s;e being conducted by one of them &s;lowly behind. After a toil&s;ome walk of &s;ome length, their path being inter|rupted by briars and matted weeds, and the hands of his conductors employed in remov|ing the branches by which they were perpe|tually interrupted. They arrived at the foot of a rock, gradually &s;loping from a prodigi|ous height, crowned on the &s;ummit with lof|ty and maje&s;tic pines, and clad to the very

foot with bru&s;h wood, intermingled with &s;mall dwarf trees.</P>
<P>Beneath this rock were &s;ome cabbins, fre&s;h|ly con&s;tructed with the branches of trees, and one indeed &s;carcely yet begun. Several per&s;ons were employed in the labour of rear|ing them, who&s;e arms lay by them.</P>
<P>Rugiero was conducted to the large&s;t of the huts, which was built &s;o as to form a kind of ve&s;tibule to a cave, which &s;eemed to have been &s;cooped by nature in the &s;olid rock. From this hut a per&s;on advanced to meet him, who &s;eemed, as he could collect from the behaviour of the re&s;t, ve&s;ted with &s;ome authority.</P>
<P>The men who had &s;eized Rugiero inform|ed this per&s;on, that being detached for for|age, they had fallen in with the pri&s;oner as he was attempting to di&s;cover their retreat, and, as was beyond all doubt confirmed by his appearance, in order to betray it to the king.</P>
<P>The per&s;on whom they addre&s;&s;ed, turning to Rugiero, a&s;ked him how he came into that &s;ituation. "But," added he, 'his garb is evidence enough of his intention&mdash;we mu&s;t teach him, that de&s;pair has rendered all at|tempts

Rugiero beg|ged to be heard; but the per&s;on who had given the&s;e orders turning his back upon him, the men who had him in cu&s;tody were about to convey him away, when he perceiv|ed an officer of a &s;uperior pre&s;ence approach.</P>
<P>This officer held by the hand a lady, plain|ly but hand&s;omely dre&s;t. What was the &s;a|tisfaction of Rugiero, when he di&s;covered in him the very nobleman under who&s;e au&s;pi|ces he had conducted the bu&s;ine&s;s of the pre|ceding evening.</P>
<P>The nobleman to whom his ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e was re|ferred, knew him immediately; ordered him to be unbound, and taking him into the cave, a&s;ked him by what &s;ingular fortune he had e&s;caped from the calamities which attended the unfortunate events of the night.</P>
<P>The apartment in the cave was lofty and &s;pacious. It received a degree of light, ju&s;t &s;ufficient to render it habitable, by an ob|lique perforation in the roof, which joined to the &s;urface of the rock at &s;ome con&s;id|erable hight above the entrance. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">is apartment, which had in former times been the re&s;idence of a hermit, were three chairs
<PB N="56" REF="028486_0055_0FD92392D71604D8">
and a table, carved rudely in wood, and &s;eemingly very old. At the end was a rude altar, formed in the &s;olid rock, having a crucifix carved with &s;ome ingenuity over it; and in the corner of the cave lay a &s;mall bed&s;tead of wood, which was covered with fearn, newly gathered.</P>
<P>Rugiero related to the young nobleman, with horror in his countenance, the dread|ful object which encountered him at lady I&s;abels' window; and the circum&s;tances which attended his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>"Heaven be prai&s;ed!" &s;aid this nobleman, who was called Count An&s;elmo;&mdash;"all then is yet well.

<P>"You had better," &s;aid An&s;elmo to Ru|giero, "change dre&s;&s;es with this fellow. In his garb, and driving the &s;orry bea&s;t on which he loads his faggots, you may ea&s;ily gain ad|mittance into the city."</P>
<P>To this propo&s;al Rugiero immediately con|&s;ented. He di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf like a pea&s;ant, and, loading an a&s;s belonging to the wood|man with faggots, he waited the commands of An&s;elmo.</P>

<P>Rugiero, armed with the&s;e in&s;tructions, &s;oon departed; but fearing, notwith&s;tanding his di&s;gui&s;e, an examination at the city gates, he adopted the precaution of &s;ewing the ring within the lining of his pack &s;addle.

<P>As &s;oon as he had conveyed his l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad of faggots to a wretched inn' to which the woodmen u&s;ually re&s;orted, he prepared him|&s;elf to execute the orders of Count An&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l|mo.

After a &s;hort time he returned, and perceiving nobody near, addre&s;&s;ed him in the words he had been taught to ex|pect.</P>
<P>Upon this, Rugiero drew a canva&s;s bag from his brea&s;t, in which were contained the thou&s;and crowns he had received from Naph|thali, and gave them to the &s;tranger, who, putting them under his cloak, told him to be in the &s;ame &s;pot exactly in &s;ix hours&mdash;but to take particular care, if po&s;&s;ible, to avoid the patrole.</P>
<P>Rugiero returned to his mi&s;erable inn, and throwing him&s;elf on a truckle bed, wait|ed with impations the expiration of the &s;ix

<P>He had not proceeded far beyond the town-hou&s;e, when the guard, in who&s;e cu&s;t|ody he was, were encountered by another party. As &s;oon as the&s;e parties came clo&s;e to each other, they halted, which they had &s;carcely done, when a man &s;pringing forward from the mid&s;t of the party which had ju&s;t arrived, &s;eized Rugiero by the collar, and &s;aid to the commander of the detachment he was with, "This is the traitor&mdash;this is the very man we are in &s;earch of&mdash;I charge you &s;eize him."</P>
<P>The commander, upon the&s;e words, ad|vanced towards Rugiero, gave him into the cu&s;tody of his own party, after a few words had pa&s;&s;ed between him and the &s;erjeant of the other detachment, when the parties &s;e|perated, each returning the way they came.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="028486_0060_0FD923A4D9653498">
The a&s;toni&s;hment of Rugiero kept him perfectly &s;ilent under this accu&s;ation; nor was that a&s;toni&s;hment le&s;&s;ened, by his per|ceiving that the per&s;on accu&s;ing him was the very man to whom he had &s;o lately delive|red the thou&s;and crowns, and who had pro|mi&s;ed to meet him.</P>
<P>He was now convinced that he was be|trayed, and that his own life, and the dear|e&s;t intere&s;ts of his lord, mu&s;t fall a &s;acrifice to his ill fortune. Yet how it had occurred he could not divine.&mdash;Wrapt in the&s;e melan|choly reflections, he walked on 'till they came to the remains of the old palace, a build|ing which had long been converted into a pri&s;on, for which u&s;e one would have thought, from its appearance, it had been originally de&s;igned.</P>
<P>In an outward apartment belonging to this place, the guard which had conducted Ru|giero hither halted, and depo&s;ited their arms; and this faithful &s;ervant was ordered to fol|low the commander of the party, who led him into a dark and intricate pa&s;&s;age, while the per&s;on who had preferred the accu&s;ation again&s;t him kept warily behind him. They pa&s;&s;ed through many &s;trong doors, of which the commander po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the keys. At length they de&s;cended by the winding &s;tairca&s;e of
<PB N="62" REF="028486_0061_0FD923A9273FCE48">
a turret, and pa&s;&s;ing a long and narrow arched vault, lighted by two dim lamps, began to a&s;cend in the &s;ame manner. After a&s;cending for &s;ome time, the guide halted, and, open|ing a door, introduced Rugiero to a &s;mall &s;trong &s;quare room, which &s;eemed to admit the light in the day by one &s;mall ca&s;ement, opened in a wall of immen&s;e thickne&s;s. In &s;hort, it &s;eemed a place of confinement for pri&s;oners of a better order, who were not de&s;tined to be very rigidly dealt with.</P>
<P>In this room, at a table, on which burned two tapers, &s;at a young man, plainly dre&s;t, who &s;eemed, as it appeared to Rugiero upon entering, in the act of painting his face by a looking-gla&s;s which &s;tood on the table; while another per&s;on, of about his own &s;tature, &s;tood at his elbow, a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in the em|ployment.</P>
<P>Such an employment, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, could not fail to &s;trike Rugiero. The young man aro&s;e &s;uddenly upon their entrance, and, taking his cloak and hat from his attendant, &s;eemed to await their orders.</P>
<P>Rugiero had now an opportunity of view|ing him. He &s;eemed very young, of an ele|gant form, and brown complexion, his hair very much over&s;hadowed his face, and
<PB N="63" REF="028486_0062_0FD923AAD85D1750">
as well as his eye-brows, was remarkably dark.</P>
<P>Rugiero's guide acco&s;ted him re&s;pectfully, and, taking off his hat, told him that the TIME WAS COME. The young man's &s;ervant upon this took up a &s;mall cloak bag, which was delivered to Rugiero, and attended his ma&s;ter, who followed the conductor to the guard room. The e&s;cort who had conducted Rugiero to this place, re&s;umed their arms, and proceeded towards the gate of the city, at which Rugiero had entered, but halted within about forty paces of it, when the commander, apologizing for the nece&s;&s;ity he was under, ordered the young man and his &s;ervant to be bound together. The &s;ame ce|remony was performed on Rugiero and his accu&s;er, who were, to his &s;urpri&s;e, bound arm to arm.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the gate, the com|mander a&s;ked for the &s;erjeant of the guard, and told him he was conducting &s;ome pri|&s;oners to a ca&s;tle, which he named, at no great di&s;tance. He then gave him the word of the night. The gate was opened, the drawbridge let down, and the detachment &s;oon &s;aw them&s;elves clear of the city.</P>

<P>THE leaders of this little party no &s;ooner found them&s;elves out of &s;ight of the gates, than they unbound the four pri&s;oners, and &s;triking out of the road, pur&s;ued their march through a hollow way, which in a few hours led them to the &s;kirts of a fore&s;t.</P>
<P>During this march, Rugiero found him&s;elf treated with much re&s;pect by the per&s;on who commanded the detachment, and the man to whom he had delivered the thou&s;and crowns.&mdash;The latter apologized to-him for the man|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> in which he had been treated; but told him, that when he found him unfortunately in the cu&s;tody of the other e&s;cort, he per|ceived there was no other mode of extricating him, than that of preferring the accu&s;ation, upon which he had been delivered up.

was the rumour of a plot to re&s;tore my father to his throne. Of my e&s;cape I know little. I was alarmed by the cry of fire. I heard a confu&s;ed noi&s;e at my door, which was &s;uddenly opened. I was conveyed, with my faithful Barbara, to a room in the old palace, whither, late la&s;t night, the di&s;gui&s;es in which we now appear were conveyed to us. Ah!

The night now grew darker, and, amid&s;t the gloom which was occa&s;ioned by the thick and lofty branches of the trees, they found it extreme|ly difficult to di&s;cern the path before them, in which they were alone guided by the deep and rugged banks which aro&s;e on each &s;ide.</P>

The wind now aro&s;e, and whi&s;tled hollow through the trees&mdash;the gloom &s;eemed redoub|led&mdash;the rain began to rattle amid&s;t the trees&mdash;and the thunder to roll at a di&s;tance&mdash;while the howling of the wolves on every &s;ide of them filled the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> party with di&s;|may.</P>
<P>They knew the ferocity of the&s;e animals, with multitudes of which this fore&s;t abound|ed; and the darkne&s;s of the night rendered them liable to unfore&s;een attacks from every &s;ide.</P>

<P>It was here re&s;olved that, as their numbers might create &s;u&s;picion, Rugiero, who was not &s;o well known as the Count, and con&s;e|quently was not &s;o liable to detection, &s;hould with the Lady I&s;abel, her Cou&s;in, and attend|ants, demand admittance, and &s;helter from the &s;torm, while the remainder of the party waited without, and &s;ought protection from the boi&s;terous inclemency of the night, in &s;ome of the outhou&s;es of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>This they might ea&s;ily do without detection, for though this Ca&s;tle was large and &s;tately, it was a place of no great &s;trength. The &s;itu|ation did not admit of its being moated, and its outward defence was a wall of no con&s;idera|ble hight.</P>
<P>Rugiero then, with I&s;abel and her fair com|panions, while the re&s;t of the party &s;tood aloof &s;hrouded by the darkne&s;s of the night, ap|plied for admittance. He had &s;lung round him a bugle horn, which An&s;elmo had given him, with orders, in ca&s;e he found him&s;elf in danger, to &s;ound an alarm. The apparel
<PB N="74" REF="028486_0073_0FD923CB64666F88">
of I&s;abel and her companion was plain and neat, and Ellenor was covered with her veil. After &s;ome time the gate was opened, and Rugiero begged for &s;helter 'till the &s;torm &s;hould pa&s;s over.</P>
<P>He &s;aid that his party had been attacked by the wolves, in pa&s;&s;ing the fore&s;t, and that they had been compelled, in order to &s;ave their own lives, to leave their hor&s;es a prey to tho&s;e ravenous animals. After relating this &s;tory, they were, upon a &s;hort delibera|tion, admitted through the court into a lofty and &s;pacious hall, hung round with armour.</P>
<P>The whole of the family &s;eemed to have retired to re&s;t, except a few &s;ervants, who were &s;tanding round a fire, to which Rugiero and his party advanced, in order to dry their cloaths. After &s;ome little time, the &s;ervants were &s;ummoned to attend their lord, who was preparing to retire for the night.</P>
<P>Rugiero and the Prince&s;s had waited but a few minutes, before they perceived the door of a room open, and two of the &s;ervants, who had ju&s;t left them, de&s;cend by a few &s;teps into the hall, bearing each a taper in his hand.</P>
<P>They were followed by a gentleman dre&s;&s;ed in deep mourning, who advancing towards

Rugiero and his companions, &s;urveyed them with &s;crutinizing eyes; but what were the feel|ings of I&s;abel, when in this per&s;on &s;he di&s;co|vered the man with who&s;e abhored addre&s;&s;es &s;he had been &s;o much per&s;ecuted&mdash;the Count Rhodolpho, the &s;on of the Count St. Amand.</P>
<P>Rhodolpho, after he had a&s;ked &s;ome que|&s;tions of Rugiero, advanced towards her. She was &s;inking with terror&mdash;he looked at her, but, to all appearance, did not recollect her, for he pa&s;&s;ed on to her Cou&s;in I&s;abel, whom he de&s;ired to lift her veil, What were the &s;en&s;ations of I&s;abel at this reque&s;t! She knew that Rhodolpho was perfectly acquainted with her Cou&s;in.&mdash;Ellenor, who likewi&s;e knew him&punc; he&s;itated and trembled. He intimated his de&s;ire with the tone of a man who would be obeyed.</P>
<P>I&s;abel, in&s;tinctively, caught hold of the horn, which hung by Rugiero's &s;ide, and rai&s;ed it to her mouth; but before her lips could reach it, overcome by her &s;en&s;ations, &s;he fainted and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance called off the attention of Rhodolpho, who no longer per&s;i&s;ted in his demand, but leaving I&s;abel, who&s;e acci|dent he imputed to fatigue, to the care of his &s;ervants, retired.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="028486_0075_0FD923D295FCA598">
He had &s;carcely turned his back, when Ellenor, forgetting all precaution at behold|ing her Cou&s;in's &s;ituation, threw off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">her veil; and flew to the lady I&s;abel's a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ervants who had attended Rhodol|pho into the hall, two had remained behind. One of them was a &s;hrewd fellow, who&s;e &s;ub|tilty and addre&s;s had recommended him much to the favour of his lord.</P>
<P>The appearance of I&s;abel and her compan|ion had &s;truck him, as bearing in it &s;omething peculiar. The circum&s;tance of her &s;eizing the bugle, which hung at Rugiero's &s;ide, and attempting to &s;ound it, had not pa&s;&s;ed unno|ticed; and the beauty of Ellenor &s;o ill accor|ding with the &s;ituation in which &s;he appeared, convinced him that &s;ome my&s;tery attended the arrival of the&s;e people at the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with this idea, while Rugiero, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Ellenor, Barbara, and the other &s;ervant, was occupied in the recovery of I&s;abel he &s;tole away to his lord, and communicated to him all he had ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Rhodolpho, arou&s;ed by this intelligence, quitted his apartment, and returned to the hall, where he unluckily arrived, un&s;een by any one, before Ellenor had replaced her veil.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="028486_0076_0FD923D6589551D8">
"Lady Ellenor!" exclaimed Rhodolpho, &s;tarting back, He looked alternately at her and I&s;abel, who was &s;till &s;itting in the chair. The efforts u&s;ed to recover her had di&s;ordered her dre&s;s&mdash;&s;ome fal&s;e hair which &s;he wore was di&s;placed&mdash;the water &s;prinkled in her face had removed &s;ome of the paint which &s;he had u&s;ed to give a brown and manly hue to her com|plexion.</P>
<P>Rhodolpho looked &s;tedfa&s;tly at her. He cla&s;ped his hands together, and rai&s;ing them in a tran&s;port, exclaimed, "by all that's &s;acred, this was above my hopes! The Prin|ce&s;s I&s;abel! At la&s;t, Madam, you are mine&mdash;nor is it in the power of heaven or earth to redeem you."</P>
<P>The arrival of all &s;he had dreaded rou&s;ed tho&s;e &s;pirits in the Prince&s;s which her fears had di&s;&s;ipated. She aro&s;e, and waving her hand, &s;aid to Rhodolpho, with an air of dig|nity,&mdash;"My Lord, I will remain no longer here&mdash;let me pa&s;s."</P>
<P>"See that no one e&s;capes," &s;aid Rhodol|pho to his &s;ervants. "Ladies," continued he, with a &s;neer,&mdash;"you mu&s;t be content with my inho&s;pitable roof to-night."</P>
<P>"Not &s;o, my Lord," &s;aid Rugiero, firmly. "Since this is the ca&s;e, we mu&s;t tru&s;t again

to the inclement elements;" and taking I&s;a|bel in one hand, and Ellenor in the other, he conducted them towards the door.</P>
<P>"On your lives, let no one pa&s;s," &s;aid Rhodolpho to his &s;ervants, who advanced to|wards the door.</P>
<P>Rugiero now quitting the hands of the la|dies, drew his &s;word, and &s;aid, in a determined tone, "The man who attempts to ob&s;truct our pa&s;&s;age, dies."</P>
<P>I&s;abel, Barbara, and Ellenor, now ran towards the door, while Rugiero, &s;till facing Rhodolpho and his &s;ervants, kept them at bay.</P>
<P>"Ring the alarm bell," cried Rhodolpho; and the &s;ervants flew different ways to arou&s;e the &s;leepy inhabitants of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Rugiero, finding him&s;elf free from the un|equal attacks of his foes, took advantage of his breathing time, and, applying his bugle horn to his mouth, &s;ounded a charge, while the delicate and trembling hands of his com|panions were applied, with un&s;kilful ha&s;te, to the ma&s;&s;y bolts and bars of the door.</P>
<P>The active alarms of the &s;ervants &s;oon brought a&s;&s;i&s;tance to their lord.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="028486_0078_0FD8BFDAB1435400">
Rugiero found his a&s;&s;ailants increa&s;e. He had repeatedly &s;ounded his horn, when, to his extreme joy, he heard his friends on the out&s;ide of the door, which I&s;abel and her companions had at length contrived to unbar.</P>
<P>Count An&s;elmo, and his party now ru&s;hed in, and giving a &s;udden check to the a&s;&s;ailants of Rugiero, bore away the Prince&s;s, her Cou|&s;in and companion. By this time, however, the hall was full of men, for Rhodolpho had quartered his company of men at arms (which his father's intere&s;t had obtained for him) at his Ca&s;tle that night, with intent to join the king on the next day. They ru&s;hed out in pur&s;uit of the fugitives, and as they exceeded An&s;elmo's little band con&s;iderably in numbers the latter were compelled to &s;eek refuge in the darkne&s;s of the night, and the thickne&s;s and ob&s;curity of the tangled fore&s;t. Pre&s;&s;ed by a formidable enemy, clo&s;e at their heels, they knew not which cour&s;e to take, but di&s;|per&s;ed in different bodies, and &s;ought their &s;afety in flight.</P>
<P>An&s;elmo, who would not quit his mi&s;tre&s;s and her lovely Cou&s;in&punc; found him&s;elf in a few minutes unaccompained by any man of his party, except Rugiero. He &s;ought the place where he had left his hor&s;es, and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Rugiero, having mounted his

<P>ANSELMO and his fair companions had travelled for &s;ome time, Rugiero pur|po&s;ely keeping behind, that, if any pur&s;uit &s;hould be made after them, he might give early intelligence of it,&mdash;when the hor&s;e on which this brave and faithful &s;ervant was mounted fell &s;uddenly with him.</P>
<P>Rugiero readily extricated him&s;elf from him, but notwith&s;tanding every effort he could make, in vain attempted to rai&s;e this worn out animal, who&s;e &s;trength was wholly exhau&s;ted. After endeavouring, without &s;ucce&s;s, to make the Count, who was at &s;ome di&s;tance before him, acquainted with this di&s;a&s;ter, for the roaring of the &s;torm compleatly drowned his exclamations, he re&s;olved to &s;it under a tree, clo&s;e to the &s;pot, where his hor&s;e lay, and wait the approach of day with patience.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="028486_0080_0FD923E14D56E6D8">
In the mean time, Count An&s;elmo, with the lady Ellenor, the Prince&s;s I&s;abel, and her companion, proceeded onward, uncon&s;cious of the fate of Rugiero. At la&s;t, however, hearing no longer the &s;ound of his hor&s;es feet, they &s;topped to li&s;ten&mdash;but they li&s;tened in vain. The howling of the wind was the only noi&s;e which &s;aluted their e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rs. They knew not what to conjecture. Every idea they could form of the fate of Rugiero &s;eemed pregnant with danger to them&s;elves. They were at length, after a long period pa&s;&s;ed in painful and fruitle&s;s expectation, compelled to pur|&s;ue their journey without him, which they did in a cheerle&s;s and melancholy &s;ilence, each of them brooding over ideas which they were almo&s;t afraid to communicate to the others.</P>
<P>They were journeying in this manner, when they came to a more open part of the fore&s;t, a large and dark object before them, which they were &s;oon convinced was, as indeed it proved, a hou&s;e. Somewhat re|vived at this pro&s;pect, they pu&s;hed for|ward, and &s;peedily arrived at an old and ruined man&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this ancient and di&s;mantled dwell|ing, they perceived no &s;igns of inhabitants. They judged it on that account a more proper &s;helter for the night; and though
<PB N="82" REF="028486_0081_0FD923E25C6B9AB0">
the Prince&s;s and her female companions were not unimpre&s;&s;ed by terrors from the awfulne&s;s of the &s;cene, they pa&s;&s;ed a crazy draw bridge, and, cro&s;&s;ing a courtyard, reached the door of the hou&s;e, which An|&s;elmo, di&s;mounting, pre&s;ently opened.</P>
<P>When he had opened it, he li&s;tened, but could hear nothing. He was the more convinced&punc; by this circum&s;tance, that the hou&s;e was uninhabited, and prevailed, after much intreaty, on his timid com|panions to leave their hor&s;es, (which he fa&s;tened together) and enter the man&s;ion with him.</P>
<P>The lightning, which had not as yet cea&s;|ed to play around them, &s;hooting through a large gothic window, di&s;played to them an old unfurni&s;hed hall. They found that the rain beat in near the &s;pot where they &s;tood, and the wind &s;wept through the various avenues of this uncomfortable a&s;yl|um. As they were much incommoded in this &s;ituation, An&s;elmo propo&s;ed that they &s;hould &s;eek a better &s;helter; and after &s;ome oppo&s;ition, his friends clinging clo&s;e around him, proceeded acro&s;s the hall, and de&s;cending by a few &s;teps, found him&s;elf in a warmer &s;tation. He now began to trace his new apartment by the walls, and
<PB N="83" REF="028486_0082_0FD923E38342AFB0">
&s;oon perceived, by the &s;tyle of the furni|ture, and the extend of the fire place, that he had reached the kitchen of this man&s;ion.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uing his di&s;covery, he &s;oon found out that this part of the man&s;ion could not have been long uninhabited, and began to entertain hopes, if he could, by accident, procure any implement with which he might &s;trike a light, of rendering their a&s;ylum le&s;s comfortle&s;s for the remainder of the time which they &s;hould be compelled to pa&s;s in it.</P>
<P>His &s;earch was not un&s;ucce&s;sful, an andit became apparent, to demon&s;tration, that the hou&s;e could not have been long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or&s;aken. He found the implements he &s;ought, and di&s;co|vering &s;ome &s;traw and faggots in a rece&s;s at no great di&s;tance from the fire-place, kindled a fire, and ea&s;ily prevailed on his &s;hivering friends to draw round it.</P>
<P>It was, in their &s;ituation, a luxury indeed. They wanted, it is true, to add to their com|fort, the provi&s;ions which they had brought from their retreat in the fore&s;t, but in the late attack, which di&s;per&s;ed their party, they were &s;eparated from the hor&s;es which had been laden with them. They huddled round the fire, and dried their cloaths. They di&s;|cour&s;ed with &s;omewhat more cheerfulne&s;s than
<PB N="84" REF="028486_0083_0FD923E6D6FDCDA0">
their conver&s;ation had of late di&s;played, and congratulated each other on their e&s;cape from the hands of Rhodolpho; 'till, exhau&s;ted with fatigue, fleep overtook them, and they &s;at &s;lumbering over the dying embers, 'till they were rouzed by a noi&s;e which har|rowed up the hearts of the females with terror, and appalled even the firm and manly brea&s;t of An&s;elmo.</P>
<P>A &s;low and &s;olemn &s;tep, attended by the cla&s;hing of chains, &s;eemed to gain upon their ears from a long pa&s;&s;age oppo&s;ite to that by which the had entered the kitchen.</P>
<P>An&s;elmo (for the lady I&s;abel and her com|panions, breathle&s;s and overcome with terror &s;hrunk behind their protector, and did not dare to ca&s;t their eyes towards the place whence the noi&s;e which alarmed them procee|ded) beheld a light gleam at a di&s;tance on the walls of the pa&s;&s;age, and &s;oon after di&s;cerned the form of a man advancing &s;lowly along it.</P>
<P>A deadly palene&s;s over&s;pread the counte|nance&mdash;the eyes were hollow, and &s;unk&mdash;the hair was clotted with blood&mdash;with which his garments were al&s;o &s;tained, and the light which An&s;elmo had de&s;cried, proceeded from a taper which he hold in his hand.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="028486_0084_0FD923E823FD45A8">
An&s;elmo's blood froze in his veins at this &s;pectacle. In &s;pite of all his fortitude his knees trembled, and a cold &s;weat bedewed his brow; nor could he arou&s;e in his mind re&s;olution enough to addre&s;s the &s;pectre before him, 'till he was awakened from this trance of terror by a &s;ingular phaenomenon.</P>
<P>The form which has been de&s;cribed contin|ued to advance, 'till it approached &s;o near to An&s;elmo, that the light of the taper gleamed upon him; upon which he &s;tarted &s;uddenly, and prepared ha&s;tily to retreat.</P>
<P>An&s;elmo, rou&s;ed by this circum&s;tance, ad|vanced to follow it; but the Prince&s;s I&s;abel and her Cou&s;in &s;hrieked aloud, and clung to him under the impul&s;e of the mo&s;t agonizing terror.</P>
<P>At their &s;hrieks the phantom again turned towards them.</P>
<P>"Whatever thou art," cried An&s;elmo, "I conjure thee &s;tay and relieve me from this horror."</P>
<P>"An&s;elmo!" exclaimed the &s;pectre, in a hollow voice, but in a tone of perplexity and wonder.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="028486_0085_0FD923E9170A0A70">
The voice, hollow as it was, &s;ounded like that of Rhinaldo. It recalled the wandering &s;en&s;es of I&s;abel. She looked in the face of the &s;peaker, pale and disfigured as it was&mdash;it was the countenance of Rhinaldo too.</P>
<P>I&s;abel &s;hrieked and fainted.</P>
<P>"Help, help my Cou&s;in I&s;abel!" ex|claimed Ellenor.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo, (for he was the &s;pectre,) ru&s;hed forward to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, while An&s;elmo re|mained motionle&s;s with wonder.</P>
<P>It was long before the beauteous I&s;abel could recover her &s;cattered &s;en&s;es, and longer before &s;he could be per&s;uaded that her Rhi|naldo &s;tood before her, impre&s;&s;ed as &s;he was with the idea that it was the &s;pirit of her de|parted lover which &s;he had &s;een.</P>

<P><Q>Rugiero had not long left us when we di&s;covered that the e&s;cape of that &s;ervant whom he had, without &s;ucce&s;s, attempted to detain, was as fatal a circum&s;tance as his affectionate fears forboded that it would be.&mdash;This fellow went immediately to a Ca&s;tle of his lords, which is at no great di&s;tance from this, and alarmed the family with the &s;tory of his death. Before we could &s;ettle any plan of e&s;cape, for which my wound, though it was but &s;light, in &s;ome degree &s;till di&s;qualified me, the hou&s;e was a&s;&s;ailed by the dome&s;tics of the Count. We barricaded it as well as we could, and prevailed on the &s;ervants who remained with us to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in our attempt to carry off the lady. We were preparing to depart when a po&s;ten door was forced, and our enemies ru&s;hed in upon us. Count Tancred and I drew our &s;words, in defence of the lady. I know no more&mdash;I was cut down&mdash;nor did I recover my &s;en&s;es, 'till I found my&s;elf loaded with the chains I now wear, and &s;urrounded by a party of ruffians whom I had never before beheld. I was conducted into the pre&s;ence of Rhodolpho, who &s;tood in the mid&s;t of a circle of armed men. When he perceived who his pri&s;oner
<PB N="88" REF="028486_0087_0FD9251B16A78B98">
was, the hatred he had always borne to|wards me broke out in the bittere&s;t invec|tives, and he ordered me to be conveyed to the dungeon from which I had re&s;cued the Count Tancred.&mdash;There my conduc|tors left me. I heard the la&s;t door of my pri&s;on clo&s;e&mdash;in vain did I wait to hear it open again&mdash;hour after hour pa&s;&s;ed away&mdash;and the horrid &s;ilence of the dungeon continued uninterrupted. My remor&s;ele&s;s foes had doomed me to all the horrors of death by famine. I &s;oon enperienced many of its pangs. I awaked from my &s;woon to an intolerable thir&s;t. Chained as I was, they had not taken the precaution to fix me to a particular &s;pot, pre&s;uming, as I &s;uppo&s;e, that I was well enough &s;e|cured. I roved round my dungeon, raging under the agony of the thir&s;t which con&s;umed me, when I felt my foot touch &s;omething. Judge what was my tran&s;port, when I perceived this to be part of an earthen pitcher of water, which had been left there when Count Tancred was removed. But I will not dwell on circum&s;tances which mu&s;t afflict you. My wounds, though they had bled much, did not prove of much con&s;equence. The horrors of my &s;itua|tion gave me &s;trength and courage. I &s;urveyed my dungeon, and by a feeble
<PB N="89" REF="028486_0088_0FD923F2D7F87980">
ray of light which entered at a narrow &s;lip towards the roof, I de&s;cried a part of the wall bricked in the form of an arch. It immediately occurred to me that this had formerly been a door way, and that it might not be of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance as the re&s;t of the wall. I &s;ought again round my cavern for &s;omething with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hich I might remove a brick, and at lea&s;t attempt to di&s;cover its thickne&s;s.&mdash;In &s;earching near the &s;tone to which my friend Tancred had been fa&s;tened, I mo&s;t providentially di&s;|covered a dagger which I had u&s;ed in attempting to free him from his chains, and had afterwards thrown carele&s;sly by. With this I went to work.&mdash;The fir&s;t brick I found much difficulty in removing&mdash;when that was done, my labour grew lighter in proportion; but many weary hours pa&s;&s;ed, before I had made an aperture big enough to admit my body. This, however, I at length accompli&s;hed, and found my&s;elf in a dungeon more horrid than that which I had quitted. It was lower than the other, and nothing more di&s;mal, damp, and faetid, can be imagined. A few worn &s;teps, ju&s;t under the breach I had made, convinced me that that part of the wall had, as I had conjectured, been
<PB N="90" REF="028486_0089_0FD923F48BF664A8">
formerly a door-way&mdash;but I was &s;oon too dreadfully convinced of it, by an object which, when I adverted to my own &s;ituation, curdled my blood with horror. By the &s;aint light which gleamed through the aperture I had made, I di&s;|coverd a ru&s;ty iron collar, chained to the wall&mdash;a hoop of iron, large enough to enclo&s;e the wai&s;t of a man, hung be|low it, clo&s;e to the ground&mdash;and be|neath it, amid a few ru&s;ted chains, and the tattered remnants of cloth which had e&s;caped putrefaction, lay in a heap the &s;keleton of the wretch who had thus &s;hrunk from his fetters. The horrors with which I was &s;truck at this &s;pectacle, did not, however, prevent my exploring my new place of confinement. I could find no door. Alas! upon this unhappy victim, the only door to the dungeon had, proba|bly, been walled up, as it was thought, for ever! In pa&s;&s;ing round this dungeon, I perceived the wind blew upon me from one corner, and, feeling the place, found that the walls were parted, either rifted by the bolt of heaven, or &s;evered by the &s;low but &s;ure hand of time. At this &s;pot, then, I renewed my labour. I will not trouble you with a detail of it. After infinite toil, for, though more decayed, the wall at this place was much thicker, than the former,
<PB N="91" REF="028486_0090_0FD923FA10EDF048">
I found my way, not many hours ago, in|to a narrow winding pa&s;&s;age, thro' which I a&s;cended into the hou&s;e.&mdash;I proceeded, you may immagine, with extreme caution; nor did I di&s;cover all the horrors of my former &s;ituation, 'till I found that the whole of the premi&s;es were de&s;erted, and I was left to undergo the fate of the mi&s;er|able victim, who&s;e remains I had &s;o lately beheld. I ju&s;t now di&s;covered the remains of &s;ome &s;alted provi&s;ions, of which I have had the prudence to eat but &s;paringly, and which perhaps, may not be unwelcome to you. What is become of my friend Count Tancred and the lady, I cannot con|jecture. She is, I &s;uppo&s;e, carried off, and when I reflect on my own &s;ituation, I can &s;carcely entertain a hope that he is yet alive.</Q></P>

<P>WHEN Rhinaldo had fini&s;hed his &s;tory, An&s;elmo related to him the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which had driven them to take &s;helter in a place which &s;eemed &s;o little calculated to pro|duce &s;o fortunate a meeting, Rhinaldo
<PB N="92" REF="028486_0091_0FD923FCC5E425F0">
brought forth the little &s;tore of provi&s;ions which he had di&s;covered. The fire was re|fre&s;hed. Rhinaldo and I&s;abel ble&s;t that pro|vidence which had thus, when lea&s;t expected, permitted them once more to behold each o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">her, and to pour forth the delicate and cha&s;te effu&s;ions of the &s;ublime&s;t of all pa&s;&s;ions, unchecked by har&s;h controul of pride, or the baneful mandates of a rigourous and unfeel|ing &s;tate policy.</P>
<P>An&s;elmo and his Ellenor were too much occupied with each other to interrupt them, nor would they, in &s;pite of the remon&s;trances of Barbara, who had alone the di&s;cretion to reflect that their pre&s;ent &s;ituation was not wholly free from danger, have &s;uffered a thought to intrude on the bli&s;s of the mo|ment, had not the &s;tep of &s;ome per&s;ons in the hall rou&s;ed them from this &s;tate of obli|vious happine&s;s.</P>
<P>An&s;elmo, &s;tarting up, drew his &s;word, and Rhinaldo, whom his own exertions and tho&s;e of his friends, tho' they could wholly liberate, had freed from &s;o much of chains, that they were no longer an incumbrance, &s;eized the fir&s;t weapon he could meet with, and they both moved towards the pa&s;&s;age which led to the hall.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="028486_0092_0FD923FF96C58B48">
They perceived two men advancing to|wards them, one of whom bore a torch in his hand.</P>
<P>"Let us &s;earch," &s;aid he, who bore the torch, "through every corner of this &s;eat of horrors. If he is alive I will find him."</P>
<P>Rhinaldo knew the voice of Tancred. "Count Tancred! and living!' cried Rhin|aldo; "thro' what miracle is it that I am again permitted to embrace my friend?"</P>
<P>"Rhinaldo! exclaimed Tancred. "Then the object of my &s;earch is attained&mdash;ble&s;&s;ed be heaven for the &s;afety of my deliverer!"</P>
<P>"But how could you e&s;cape," re&s;umed Rhinaldo, "the danger in which we were both involved?"</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid Tancred, "I am indebted for my unhappy life to the lovelie&s;t&mdash;the be&s;t of women!&mdash;but no more of that&mdash;the thought is too much&mdash;Oh! let me but live to return the boon &s;he gave!&mdash;to die for her!&mdash;but I rave&mdash;To make &s;hort of my &s;tory&mdash;"When I la&s;t &s;aw you, we were occupied in the defence of the Counte&s;s. While we were engaged with a party, too numerous for any but de&s;perate men to contend with,

another band &s;eized the Counte&s;s, and bore her away. I left your &s;ide, my friend, and ru&s;hed to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I was &s;truck down by a partizan&mdash;another arm was lifted for my de&s;truction&mdash;the Counte&s;s caught hold of it&mdash;&s;he put her pur&s;e into the hand of the &s;oldier, and begged he would make his mi&s;tre&s;s his debtor, by &s;aving my life. She promi&s;ed the highe&s;t rewards. Intere&s;t, or, as I have rea&s;on to believe from his late con|duct humanity, determined this brave fellow. On the in&s;tant he be&s;trode me, fallen as I was, his comrades were quickly occupied in conveying away the Counte&s;s; and when he found him&s;elf free from ob&s;ervation, he rai&s;ed me from the ground, and carried me to a private part of the Ca&s;tle, whither, after the departure of Rhodolpho, he returned with his father, a woodman, of this fore&s;t, and conveyed me to his cottage. I had there &s;o little recovered the effect of the blow I had received, that I &s;carcely knew what they did; but was &s;oon re-e&s;tabli&s;hed by the care that was taken of me. Behold my deliverer&mdash;he has re&s;olved to &s;hare my fortune&mdash;"</P>
<P>As Count Tancred was proceeding, Rhinal|do was alarmed by the trampling of hor&s;es. They pau&s;ed and li&s;tened&mdash;the noi&s;e increa&s;ed&mdash;the voices of men were di&s;tinctly heard.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="028486_0094_0FD9240528345008">
"We are &s;urrounded," cried An&s;elmo. "Rhodolpho's party have traced us."</P>
<P>"There is then but one &s;tep to take," &s;aid Rhinaldo. "Follow me."</P>
<P>I&s;abel and her companions &s;eemed now in|ured to terror. They &s;uffered them&s;elves to be led in &s;ilence. Rhinaldo conducted them up a back &s;tairca&s;e, towards the room in which the Counte&s;s had been confined. They ar|rived at the little lumber room, which con|tained the battered armour. From this place Rhinaldo took the precaution to arm him&s;elf. He took down &s;ome of the &s;words, but they were wholly un&s;erviceable. At la&s;t he cho&s;e a &s;trong and heavy pole axe, and &s;hoving back the pannel, di&s;covered to his friends the iron door. This door he opened, and bidding the forlorn party, which he conduct|ed, enter the apartment, he replaced the pan|nel as carefully as po&s;&s;ible, and joined his friends below.</P>
<P>They were convinced that the noi&s;e they had heard proceeded from &s;ome per&s;ons who had pur&s;ued them from the Ca&s;tle of Rhodol|pho, and who, probably, &s;u&s;pecting that if they &s;hould by chance have taken that road, they would retire to the old man&s;ion for &s;helter, or, perhaps, attracted by the light
<PB N="96" REF="028486_0095_0FD9240846975120">
of the fire they had kindled, or of the taper which Rhinaldo had procured, were induced to &s;earch for them there.</P>
<P>They formed many conjectures as to the number of their enemies; at the &s;uppo&s;ed magnitude of which they were not &s;o much alarmed, as at the idea that Rhodolpho might be among them, who had, mo&s;t probably, been acquainted by his father with the &s;ecret of the pannel&mdash;a &s;ecret, as yet, perhaps, un|divulged to any other per&s;on.</P>
<P>Their fears, however, as to the pre&s;ence of Rhodolpho, proved on this occa&s;ion un|founded. He was on the &s;ucceeding day to join A&s;tolpho with his company of men at arms, and had only detached on this pur&s;uit a pretty numerous train of dome&s;tics, well armed and headed by two of his mo&s;t tru&s;ty adherents.</P>
<P>While they &s;tood wrapt in the&s;e con|jectures, and in a mournful &s;ilence the re&s;ult of them, they were arou&s;ed by the &s;ound of many &s;teps a&s;cending the &s;tairs, which led to the little lumber room. They li&s;tened in a &s;tate of breathle&s;s expectation and terror.&mdash;They had not yet clo&s;ed to the iron door; nor indeed could its &s;trength avail them, as all the fa&s;tnings were on the outer &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="028486_0096_0FD9240E95086E10">
They heard a per&s;on walk &s;lowly round the lumber room. What were their &s;en&s;ations when he exclaimed, "We can go no farther this way&mdash;let us return."</P>
<P>This was a&s;&s;ented to by a companion who was with him, and they heard, with a rap|ture &s;carcely to be de&s;cribed, their returning foot&s;teps on the &s;tairca&s;e which they had ju&s;t a&s;cended.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo and his companions continued in their place of concealment for half an hour, before they judged it prudent to make any attempt towards di&s;covering whether their pur&s;uers had retired; for, in their &s;ecluded &s;ituation, they could hear nothing.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo then &s;lowly began to open the pannel, when an object pre&s;ented it&s;elf, which induced him to clo&s;e it again with a ha&s;te which &s;truck a &s;udden terror to the hearts of his companions.</P>
<P>This object was the face of a man. This per&s;on, who bore a light in his hand, was a&s;cending the &s;tairca&s;e when Rhinaldo percei|ved him, who encouraged a faint hope, that, from the di&s;tance he was at, the taper he bore could not ca&s;t any &s;trong reflection on the walls of the room.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="028486_0097_0FD924126BE73260">
This hope, however, &s;oon died away. They heard a clattering noi&s;e again&s;t the pannel it&s;elf, and immediately prepared them|&s;elves to receive this intruder in &s;uch a man|ner as to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, any di&s;covery through his means.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> afterwards the noi&s;e cea&s;ed, and they heard the foot&s;teps of this per&s;on de&s;cending the &s;tairca&s;e, as they immediately conjectured, to procure a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They now gave them&s;elves up for lo&s;t, and an hour pa&s;&s;ed before Rhinaldo dared again attempt to open the pannel. He proceeded cautiou&s;ly; but his effort was accompanied by a noi&s;e he could not account for; and a heavy object fell inwards again&s;t his legs. This he &s;oon di&s;covered to be a cuira&s;s, which indeed the per&s;on who had cau&s;ed them &s;o much alarm had placed there.</P>
<P>This per&s;on had returned to this ancient armoury, to try if he could accommodate him&s;elf with &s;ome pieces of more value than his own&mdash;but probably retired di&s;appointed in his aim.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo now recovered from this new alarm, and proceeded cautiou&s;ly towards the head of the great &s;tairca&s;e. When he arrived there, he heard the murmer of voices at the
<PB N="99" REF="028486_0098_0FD92414B1601B30">
door of the hall, and found that their pur|&s;uers, tired of their vain &s;earch, were about to mount their hor&s;es and retire. He waited 'till he heard them pa&s;s over the drawbridge, and then returning to his friends, acquainted them with this event.</P>
<P>Upon intelligence &s;o welcome, they quit|ted their place of concealment, and after waiting 'till they judged that their pur&s;uers had proceeded far enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o in&s;ure them from the danger of a di&s;covery, they &s;allied from the&s;e crazy walls, and left this forlorn|man&s;ion for ever!</P>
<P>They had no &s;ooner gained the fore&s;t, than I&s;abel, throwing her arms round her Cou&s;in, and faithful attendant, mingled her tears with theirs; and Rhinaldo and An&s;elmo, pre&s;&s;ing I&s;abel and Ellenor gently to their brea&s;ts, joined with them in pouring forth their thanks to heaven for their &s;ignal de|liverance; while Count Tancred contem|plated, in deep and &s;ilent &s;orrow, the my&s;te|rious fate which involved that adored object, for whom alone he thought the life he had &s;o lately retrieved worth pre&s;erving.</P>

<P>THOUGH Rhinaldo, the Lady I&s;abel, and their friends, were delivered from their late peril, it was &s;till a matter of &s;erious deliberation in what manner they &s;hould now proceed. To remain where they were 'till the day &s;hould dawn, would render them liable to all the dangers that might re&s;ult from a di&s;covery. It was re&s;olved, therefore, dark as the night was, to proceed, and they travel|led onward, 'till the day broke upon them, in a &s;mall opening of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>A &s;tream, which broke from the &s;ummit of a lofty cliff&punc; that bounded them on one &s;ide, and ran murmuring along the foot of it, temp|ted them to halt here for a &s;hort time, and take that repo&s;e, of which they were &s;o much in need. After drinking of this &s;tream, and re&s;ting them&s;elves, they pur&s;ued their journey.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="028486_0101_0FD9241F6AB26B80">
Though the dread of being overtaken had &s;upported them thro' more than common exertions, yet nature began, at length, to be exhau&s;ted&mdash;and I&s;abel, di&s;&s;olving into tears, declared that &s;he mu&s;t die where &s;he was, for &s;he could proceed no farther; &s;aying this, &s;he &s;unk into Rhinaldo's arms, who laid her gent|ly on the turf, and, &s;upporting her head on his brea&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> over her in all the agony of the mo&s;t piercing de&s;pair.</P>
<P>An&s;elmo, Ellenor, and Barbara, (the two latter of whom felt a degree of faintne&s;s and la&s;&s;itude almo&s;t equal to that of the fainting I&s;abel,) knew not what to do. At length An|&s;elmo perceiving that the cliff, from which the &s;tream took its cour&s;e, &s;till appeared through the tops of the trees on his right hand, pro|po&s;ed to Count Tancred, if po&s;&s;ible, to climb it, that from its &s;ummit they might explore the country around, under the precarious hope that &s;ome relief might po&s;&s;ibly be at hand. Impre&s;&s;ed with this idea, they made their way towards it, and had &s;carcely gained the margin of the rivulet, when, to their infi|nite &s;urpri&s;e and joy, they &s;aw the eminence terminate at &s;ome di&s;tance from them, by an ea&s;y de&s;cent, inter&s;per&s;ed with clumps of trees, leaving the rivulet to wind through a beauti|ful valley, which divided the fore&s;t as far as the eye could reach.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="028486_0102_0FD9242155ED3860">
At the bottom of this de&s;cent, and clo&s;e on the banks of the rivulet, they di&s;covered a cottage&punc; and ha&s;tened towards it, to endeavour to procure relief.</P>
<P>They had &s;carcely gained the wooden bridge, by which it communicated with the valley, when a man advanced from the cottage door to meet them. What was the &s;urpri&s;e of An|&s;elmo, when he perceived this man to be Ru|giero.</P>
<P>After expre&s;&s;ing his a&s;toni&s;hment at a meet|ing &s;o unexpected, he communicated to Ru|giero the &s;ituation in which he had left his com|panions, and they returned to the &s;pot where I&s;abel had &s;unk under her fatigue. They found her &s;till &s;upported by Rhinaldo, and her Cou&s;in and attendant &s;itting by her, in a dreary &s;ilence. Intelligence of the unexpe|cted relief which was at hand gave &s;ome ani|mation to their drooping &s;pirits.</P>
<P>I&s;abel aro&s;e, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Rhinal|do, and leaning on his arm, and upheld by Count Tancred on the other &s;ide, &s;he followed An&s;elmo, who &s;upported the feeble &s;teps of his weary Ellenor, while Rugiero &s;erved them as a guide, and Barbara leaning on the attendant of Count Tancred, followed her lady.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="028486_0103_0FD92426E4688A98">
The owner of the dwelling received them with an hone&s;t though ru&s;tic ho&s;pitality. He de&s;ired his wife, who was nothing backward in her civilities, to attend to the lady, for as yet he di&s;covered but one, while he prepared a homely meal for the re&s;t, whom he per|ceived to &s;tand in great need of refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>I&s;abel and Ellenor were conducted by the old woman, after &s;he had been informed of the &s;ecret of their &s;ex, to a comfortable bed, on which they threw them&s;elves without un|dre&s;&s;ing; and Barbara, at their de&s;ire, placing her&s;elf by their &s;ide, they &s;oon fell into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound and refre&s;hing &s;leep.</P>
<P>During this period, Rugiero vi&s;ited Rhi|naldo's wounds. They had been originally flight, and a good con&s;titution had already &s;o far contributed to their cure, that this &s;kilful dome&s;tic found his labours limited to the freeing his ma&s;ter from the traces of the blood which had originally i&s;&s;ued from them. Hav|ing therefore dre&s;&s;ed him as well as the barene&s;s of his toilet would permit, and per&s;uaded him to take, in an ea&s;y chair, that repo&s;e of which he &s;tood &s;o much in need, he related to Count An&s;elmo tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which had hap|pened to him &s;ince they had lo&s;t him in the fore&s;t. He told him of the accident which had happened to his hor&s;e, which he had rea|&s;on to believe never ro&s;e from the &s;pot where he fell.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="028486_0104_0FD9242889861088">
"I waited," continued Rugiero, "under the tree, to which I had crept for &s;helter, till the &s;torm had in &s;ome mea&s;ure abated, when I returned to try if I could rai&s;e my hor&s;e. After &s;everal efforts I found it impracticable, and was finally obliged to give over the at|tempt, on hearing the trampling of a body of hor&s;emen on the road. As it appeared to me probable that the&s;e were of Count Rhodol|pho's party, I turned immediately out of the path, and making acro&s;s the fore&s;t, which at that place is tolerably open, I had the good luck, before I had proceeded far, to arrive at the banks of this rivulet, and, finding no bridge acro&s;s it, pur&s;ued my path along its margin, 'till I di&s;covered this cottage.</P>
<P>"The old pair, who inhabit it, are va&s;&s;als to Count Rhodolpho, but having hoarded &s;ome money in the &s;ervice of the father of the late Count de St. Amand, are in ea&s;y circum|&s;tances.&mdash;This I learned from them&s;elves on my arrival.

After a few hours pa&s;&s;ed in &s;leep, the Lady I&s;abel aro&s;e, much refre&s;hed, and awakening her Cou&s;in and attendant; they joined Rhi|naldo and his friends.</P>
<P>A con&s;ultation again took place.&mdash;An&s;elmo communicated to his friends the fears of Ru|giero, and it was agreed, after &s;ome delibera|tion, that they &s;hould &s;eek the Ca&s;tle of Count Roderic, Rhinaldo's father, where they dee|med them&s;elves &s;ure of protection.</P>
<P>Though they were not acquainted with the direct road to it, they knew in what part of the country it lay; and Rugiero he&s;itated not to declare, that he thought he could undertake to conduct them towards it. Having then gratified their kind ho&s;ts, and provided them|&s;elves with &s;ome refre&s;hments for their journey they departed, and cro&s;&s;ing into a thicker part of the fore&s;t, to avoid being di&s;covered, they turned their &s;teps towards that part of the country in which Rugiero conjectured the Count Roderic's Ca&s;tle lay.</P>
<P>After a march of &s;ome hours, they &s;topped to refre&s;h them&s;elves, and &s;etting forward again pur&s;ued their journey 'till the &s;hades of evening began again to overtake them.</P>
<P>Though they had travelled far, there was yet no appearance of the Ca&s;tle; and from

the an&s;wers of Rugiero, to the ince&s;&s;ant que|&s;tions which the fears of Lady I&s;abel &s;ugge&s;ted, it was perceived that he was at lea&s;t more dif|fident of his knowledge then he had been in the morning.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery had an affect on the &s;pirits of the whole party. The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubjec|ting their fair companions, for another night, to the inclemency of the &s;kies, gave a double portion of angui&s;h to the brea&s;ts of An&s;elmo, and Rhinaldo, and they moved onward in a mournful &s;ilence, which every one &s;eemed too much occupied by his own thoughts to in|terrupt.</P>
<P>As they were thus &s;lowly travelling onward they arrived at a ri&s;ing ground, on which was erected a &s;tone cro&s;s.&mdash;This mark Rugiero no &s;ooner perceived, than he &s;uddenly exclai|med that he knew the &s;pot.</P>
<P>"To the right," &s;aid he, "is an hermitage belonging to the Convent of St. Julian; and to the left, within the di&s;tance of half a mile, the road, which leads to Count Roderic's Ca&s;tle, which cannot be more than &s;ix miles from us."</P>
<P>An&s;elmo propo&s;ed that they &s;hould turn towards the hermitage, where the Lady I&s;abel and her Cou&s;in, who &s;eemed worn out with

fatigue, might re&s;t 'till the morning; but the&s;e ladies appeared to have collected fre&s;h &s;pirits from the information of Rugiero, and anxious to arrive at a place of &s;afety, declared that they were very well enabled to reach the Ca&s;tle, urging Rhinaldo to proceed with &s;o much eagerne&s;s, that the plan was, as it turned out, mo&s;t unluckily adopted.</P>
<P>They &s;oon reached the road, but had not travelled far along it, when, as they turned the corner of a wood, which projected towards the road, they were overtaken by a troop of cavalry, who had no &s;ooner di&s;covered, than they gallopped immediately towards them.</P>
<P>At the head of this troop they quickly di&s;|covered Rhodolpho, who immediately ordered them to be &s;urrounded and di&s;armed.</P>
<P>The hor&s;emen, who con&s;i&s;ted of Rhodolpho's company of men at arms, attended by their valets, immediately pre&s;&s;ed upon them.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo, prepared to defend the Prince&s;s and her Cou&s;in to the la&s;t extremity, drew up his little band, with their backs to the wood, and &s;eeing Rhodolpho pre&s;s onwards with the re&s;t, &s;prung forward, and aimed a blow at him with his pole-axe, which, as he &s;tooped to avoid it, alighted on his &s;houlder, and brought him to the ground.</P>

<P>This accident occupied part of his troop, who &s;urrounded him. As &s;oon as he recove|red him&s;elf, he gave orders that the women, who&s;e habits he di&s;cribed, &s;hould be &s;eized, while the men were engaged, and carried off.</P>
<P>This command was &s;peedily executed by the valets, who, being unarmed, could the more readily di&s;mount.&mdash;While Rhinaldo and his friends were pre&s;&s;ed by the hor&s;emen, the&s;e fellows &s;eized on the Prince&s;s and her compa|nions, and in &s;pite of their efforts, their tears and &s;upplications, bore them away.</P>
<P>This was not done without oppo&s;ition from their little party, who, upon hearing the &s;hrieks of the women, made a daring effort to join them; but pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides by the hor&s;emen, another body of whom formed up to cover the retreat of tho&s;e who bore off the Prince&s;s, they were finally compelled to retire, and &s;eek &s;helter in the wood, which they did without difficulty, for the hor&s;emen, who were completely and heavily armed, having no room to charge them, found them&s;elves rather incumbered than a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their lances,

<P>It would be difficult to paint the de&s;pair which &s;eized on Rhinaldo and An&s;elmo at this fatal event.

<P>It was at la&s;t re&s;olved that they &s;hould pur|&s;ue their way to the Ca&s;tle, when their atten|tion was called towards Count Tancred, who was &s;itting at the foot of a tree. He had received a wound, from the thru&s;t of a lance, in his arm and it bled &s;o profu&s;ely, that there was little hope of his being able to walk &s;o far as to the Ca&s;tle that evening; and Rugiero, who bound up his wound, propo&s;ed that they &s;hould &s;eek &s;helter for the night, at the hermitage he had mentioned, which was not a great di&s;tance, and proceed in the morning towards the Ca&s;tle. This advice was in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, too &s;alutary to be neglected, and they returned to the &s;tone cro&s;s, which they had &s;o lately left, whence Rugiero conducted them to the her|mitage.</P>

<P>THE venerable inhabitant of the place had not yet lighted his lamp, but &s;at at the door of his cavern, wrapt in meditation. He advanced to meet them with a benevolent &s;mile, and offered them the &s;helter of his lowly roof, in terms which a long acquaintance with the more poli&s;hed &s;ociety among mankind could alone communicate; and he no &s;ooner perceived the &s;ituation of Count Tancred, than he produced &s;ome medicinal &s;tores, for which he was much famed among the neigh|bouring poor, and in&s;pecting the wound, ap|plied to it a dre&s;&s;ing, from the experienced virtues of which he promi&s;ed him&s;elf a &s;peedy &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>He could not but perceive the gloom and de&s;podency which hung over &s;ome of his gue&s;ts and which all their efforts to gratify him by a cheerful acceptance of his favours, could not di&s;pel; but his &s;kill in mankind had taught <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">im, that were grief admits of alleviation, by being participated, it will obtrude it&s;elf; and

that were it &s;eeks concealment, it is generally too poignant to be relieved by communication.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo, however, who knew not of any motive he had to conceal him&s;elf, &s;o near to his father's Ca&s;tle, and who, had any &s;uch motive occurred, would have di&s;dained a con|cealment with any one who belonged to the convent of St. Julian, made him&s;elf readily known to the hermit, and introduced his friends An&s;elmo and Tancred.</P>
<P>The venerable hermit received this commu|nication with politene&s;s, but a vi&s;ible re&s;erve hung over him during the re&s;t of the repa&s;t, which Rugiero, the mo&s;t unconcerned of the gue&s;ts, except Count Tancred's deliverer, was the fir&s;t to notice.</P>
<P>It perplexed this faithful &s;ervant, and he watched an opportunity to communicate hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ob&s;ervation to his ma&s;ter.&mdash;This, however, he waited in vain to obtain.</P>
<P>The hermit, as &s;oon as their frugal repa&s;t was fini&s;hed, begged that Rhinaldo would indulge him, by accompanying him round his little domains, which it had been for many years hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> daily ta&s;k to beautify; and his other gue&s;ts perceiving that they were not included in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> invitation, &s;uffered Rhinaldo, who readily ac|cepted of this offer, to accompany him alon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></P>

<P>"Count Roderic's Ca&s;tle," continued the hermit, "is in the hands of the king."</P>
<P>"Has my father then," &s;aid Rhinaldo, in a tone of grief, "&s;ided with the u&s;urper? A|las! why was not I permitted to communicate to him that &s;ecret, the concealment of which has produced &s;o much mi&s;chief; for had he known that his lawful &s;overeign&mdash;"</P>

The king," &s;aid the hermit, "&s;urprized him&mdash;no &s;ooner had the plot, in which you embarked, failed&punc; than A&s;tolpho &s;et out ha|&s;tily for the frontiers.

<P>Rhinaldo &s;eemed wrapt, for a moment, in gloomy reflections. He &s;tarted, after a pau&s;e, from his reverie.&mdash;"And father Anthony?" &s;aid Rhinaldo, in a he&s;itating voice.</P>
<P>"My &s;on, I commend thy caution," &s;aid the hermit; "but father Anthony is now

acknowledged for that which he is. Yes," continued the venerable anchorite, his eyes gleaming with the fire of youth as he &s;poke, "our lawful lord and &s;overeign, Emanuel, commands the forces on Mount St. Julian, and may &s;ucce&s;s attend his arms! His &s;ituation indeed, at pre&s;ent, is not without danger; but if the diver&s;ion on the we&s;tern frontiers, which is already formidable, &s;hould draw off any &s;trong detachment of A&s;tolpho's forces, what may we not expect?"</P>
<P>"Thou &s;peake&s;t with a &s;ire that would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ame the tardine&s;s of younger men, father," &s;aid Rhinaldo.</P>
<P>"Would I could join my brethren of the Mount in arms!" replied the hermit. "But even here I may not prove wholly u&s;ele&s;s."</P>
<P>Rhinaldo now returned to join his friends, and the hermit &s;pread before them &s;ome mats, the work of his own hands, compo&s;ed of gra&s;s and ru&s;hes; but the &s;ofte&s;t down could not have allured Rhinaldo to &s;lumber. He revolved in his mind the &s;ituation of his father; and the lo&s;s of I&s;abel, which had &s;o deeply afflicted him, &s;eemed to lo&s;e &s;ome of the bitterne&s;s with which it had overwhelmed him.</P>
<P>He judged that his own conduct, which he now cen&s;ured as ha&s;ty and ra&s;h, had involved that honoured parent in di&s;grace and ruin&mdash;
<PB N="16" REF="028486_0115_0FD92450943E8690">
perhaps had given him up a prey to the knife of the &s;ecret a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. He could not for a mo|ment endure the pang of a thought &s;o pregnant with horror. He re&s;olved at all events to pro|ceed to the Ca&s;tle, and learn the fate of his father, that, if he &s;till lived, he might learn his de&s;tiny, and participate his misfortunes; and, if dead, might revenge his death, or de|vote him&s;elf a &s;acrifice to the fatal con&s;equences of his ra&s;h and my&s;terious enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>An&s;elmo, who&s;e lo&s;s would not permit him to enjoy a large portion of repo&s;e than fell to the lot of Rhinaldo, left his couch with the fir&s;t dawn of day, and perceived his friend already ri&s;en, and tracing, with pen&s;ive &s;tep, the beautiful, yet gloomy rece&s;&s;es, with which the neighbourhood of the hermitage abounded.</P>
<P>Here Rhinaldo related to him the intelli|gence which he had received from the hermit, and concluded with his fixed determination to di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf, and at all events, if po&s;&s;ible, gain acce&s;s to the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The venerable father now joined them, and having in vain endeavoured to point out to Rhinaldo the ra&s;hne&s;s of his undertaking, was compelled to acquie&s;ce in his determination, and offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t in preparing him for the perpetration of his de&s;ign.</P>

An&s;elmo, when he heard that the rallying point of the party which had been &s;o un&s;uc|ce&s;sful in the enterpri&s;e, of which he had been the leader, was &s;o near the &s;pot where he now was, re&s;olved to join the faithful adherents of Emanuel at the convent of St. Julian; and re|ceived intelligence from the hermit of a pa&s;s by which he might gain the out-po&s;ts, avoid|ing at the &s;ame time the troops of A&s;tolpho, and a &s;ecret word, which would procure him ready admi&s;&s;ion to their leaders.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo, in pur&s;uance of his de&s;ign, cut his hair clo&s;e to his head; and having other|wi&s;e, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice of his friends, &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed his per&s;on, that there was little dread of his being di&s;covered, changed his dre&s;s for that of the man who had attended Count Tancred, and, having taken a friendly leave of that nobleman, who&s;e wound became &s;o much inflamed, as to threaten him with &s;ome confinement in the hermitage, he depart|ed, accompanied by Count An&s;elmo and his faithful Rugiero.</P>
<P>When they had proceeded about three miles on their journey, Count An&s;elmo, accompa|nied by Rugiero, whom his lord, in &s;pite of all his intreaties, refu&s;ed to admit to a &s;hare in the adventure he was about to undertake, le&s;t his pre&s;ence &s;hould lead to a di&s;covery, quitted

<P>Deep in meditation on his intended &s;cheme, and revolving in his mind plan after plan, now adopting and now rejecting them, as they offered them&s;elves for his con&s;ideration, Rhi|naldo came within &s;ight of his father's Ca&s;tle, before any &s;ettled &s;y&s;tem of operation had &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf to him.</P>
<P>While he was thus mu&s;ing, his eyes fixed with a mournful gaze on the well-known tur|rets, which recalled to his memory many of the cheerful and innocent hours of childhood, he came &s;uddenly upon a guard of A&s;tolpho's &s;oldiers, who were po&s;ted on one of the ave|nues to the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The centinel who was on duty a&s;ked him who he was? and where he was going? As he was he&s;itating what an&s;wer he &s;hould give, he perceived the corporal, who was comman|ding officer of this party, mi&s;erably thrumming upon a harp.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, "that he was a poor harper, who had been robbed in the fore&s;t of that which was the only means of his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence&mdash;his harp."</P>
<P>This was a lure, from which he hoped to

Nor was he deceived in his expectations. The corporal aro&s;e upon hearing this, and, giving him the in&s;trument, de&s;ired him to play. He had no &s;ooner touched it, than the whole guard forgot their duty. They received him as if he had been an old acquaintance, and the corporal placing him on the &s;eat which he had ju&s;t occupied, they &s;at in a circle round him, li&s;tening to the &s;trains which flowed from his in&s;trument in &s;ilent rapture.</P>
<P>To this officer he particular attached him|&s;elf, and &s;o won upon him, by imparting to him a few in&s;tructions concerning the in&s;tru|ment he &s;o much admired, that when he was relieved, he &s;wore he would not part with &s;o valuable a friend, but conducted him to the guardhou&s;e of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>He was &s;oon familiarized among the &s;oldiers, and frequently urged to enli&s;t among them, but telling his friend, the corporal, frankly, that he did not like the &s;ituation, and wi&s;hed to be placed in &s;ervice, that officer &s;oon intro|duced him to one of the &s;ervants of the hou&s;e, who was like him&s;elf fond of mu&s;ic; and by the good offices of this patron, Rhinaldo be|came &s;oon enrolled among the liveried attend|ants on A&s;tolpho.</P>

<P>THUS introduced to his paternal man&s;ion, he mingled unnoticed with the &s;ervile herd, among whom he was enrolled, and traced, in this ob&s;cure &s;ituation, tho&s;e &s;tately apartments, which had rung with gratulatory acclamations at his birth, and where his youth had been fo&s;tered with the mo&s;t anxious care.</P>
<P>The &s;plendid armour which adorned the hall, had proved the hardy deeds of a long line of warlike ance&s;tors; and the banners which waved over them, were badges of their illu&s;trious de&s;cent.</P>

It was thought that A&s;tolpho was aware of this departure, and winked at it, though Count Ro|deric could have but one de&s;ign in it, which was to join his friends in the we&s;t, for, within half a league of the Ca&s;tle, he was &s;et upon by a party, and killed with the &s;hot of an arque|bu&s;s, pointed directly at his brea&s;t, &s;o clo&s;e that his cor&s;let was unable to re&s;i&s;t the balls.</P>
<P>Not one of his attendants e&s;caped; but the tran&s;action was witne&s;&s;ed by &s;ome who knew his armour. They &s;ought afterwards for the body, but that, as well as tho&s;e of his attend|ants, was carried off, and probably for rea&s;ons known to A&s;tolpho, if he were really the au|thor of this murder, buried in &s;ome &s;acred place.</P>
<P>The reflections of Rhinaldo upon this hor|rid cata&s;trophe, were the mo&s;t bitter that un|bounded

grief and unavailing remor&s;e could furni&s;h. He looked upon him&s;elf as the mur|derer of his father. A &s;ettled gloom over|&s;pread his mind, and nothing but the hope of revenge could have in&s;tigated him to perform the ta&s;k he had undertaken, or have procra|&s;tinated, for a moment, a di&s;covery which mu&s;t have proved fatal to him.</P>
<P>From the&s;e more than melancholy reflec|tions, he was arou&s;ed by intelligence which diverted his affections into a different channel. He learned that the Prince&s;s was actually, as he &s;u&s;pected, in the Ca&s;tle; but nobody whom he could conver&s;e with had yet &s;een her. It was al&s;o reported that Rhodolpho was &s;oon to be married to her.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo, acquainted as he was with the Ca&s;tle from the days of his earlie&s;t youth, knew that, if &s;he was actually there, &s;he could not be long concealed from him, and re&s;olved to watch the motions of Rhodolpho with a &s;crutinizing eye.</P>
<P>In the mean time ho&s;tilities were vigorou&s;ly carried on between the two parties.</P>
<P>A&s;tolpho had a very &s;trong force with him at the Ca&s;tle, with which he continued to make vigorous a&s;&s;aults again&s;t the Priory; but, be&s;ides that, that po&s;t was almo&s;t impregnable

<P>The wound which had detained Count Tan|cred at the hermitage, proved more ob&s;tinate than he had expected; nor did the &s;tate of his mind in any way contribute to the for|warding its cure; but he found, in the con|ver&s;ation of the venerable hermit, much alle|viation to his &s;orrows.</P>
<P>This holy father, who had long trod, in a di&s;tingui&s;hed character, the bu&s;y &s;tage of the world, had not viewed mankind without ob|&s;ervation.

<P>Count Tancred, who, in communicating his griefs to &s;uch a man, found the only alle|viation to his &s;orrows of which they were ca|pable, &s;oon entru&s;ted to him the &s;ecret of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> melancholy, to which it was too apparent hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> heart was a prey.</P>

<Q><P>YOU will not, my venerable father, &s;aid the Count, long wonder at the weight which oppre&s;&s;es my &s;oul, and which, in &s;pite of all efforts to throw it off, &s;till baf|fles my endeavours, when I relate to you my unhappy &s;tory.</P>
<P>You are not ignorant, that our monarch A&s;tolpho, &s;urnamed the Proud, had a &s;i&s;ter many years younger than him&s;elf, whom, when upon the death of the great and good Emanuel, he mounted the throne of Lom|bardy, he drew from the retirement in which &s;he had been 'till that period im|mured.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s A&s;pa&s;ia was at this time of &s;uch tender years, that it was not judged proper to detain her long at court. The Ca&s;tle of Montalban, than which none can be more delightfully &s;ituated, was fitted up in a mo&s;t princely manner for her re&s;idence; and her hou&s;ehold was e&s;tabli&s;hed under the government and direction of a lady, her re|lation.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="028486_0125_0FD92475696C2428">
Of this e&s;tabli&s;hment I had, what I then e&s;teemed, the good fortune to make one. In an age, little advanced beyond that of infancy, I was appointed one of the pages to the Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>Let me pa&s;s over, my venerable father, tho&s;e hours, in which the &s;eeds of a pa&s;&s;ion, which I &s;hall carry with me to the grave, began to unfold them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e delicious moments, which were ince&s;&s;antly marked by &s;en&s;ations as &s;weet as unde&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, are awakened to the memory, only to imbitter, by obtruding them&s;elves into a compari&s;on with others which have been as &s;trongly tinctured with complicated mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>What was at fir&s;t duty, &s;oon grew to be &s;omething more&mdash;and, &s;urely, no hours can be more &s;weetly pa&s;&s;ed than tho&s;e in which his duties of &s;tation are &s;timulated by af|fection, and have the reward of not pa&s;&s;ing unnoticed by their object.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed me&mdash;I adored her&mdash;we grew up together, and our pa&s;&s;ion &s;trengthened with our years.</P>
<P>Let me ha&s;ten to the conclu&s;ion of a tale, which too much oppre&s;&s;es me.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="028486_0126_0FD9247751DC72E0">
In the time of the late wars, A&s;tolpho &s;carcely during three years re&s;ided for three months in the capital. The Prince&s;s, tho' of an age to grace the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed circles, by her under&s;tanding as well as her beauty, &s;eemed to be forgotten, and remai|ned, without a murmer on her part, at the Ca&s;tle of Montalban.</P>
<P>Happy period! Period! made up of the mo&s;t delicious moments! To &s;ee her dai|ly&mdash;to attend her as the &s;weete&s;t, the mo&s;t grateful of duties urged me, was all my full &s;atisfied heart had learned to wi&s;h! Alas! it was too &s;oon to end. I became of an age, when it was deemed improper that I &s;hould remain idle at home.</P>
<P>I was appointed to a command; and, with as much alacrity as a man can po&s;&s;e&s;s, who leaves behind him all to which his heart has learned to cleave, I joined the army. I was then &s;tationed with the &s;ame brigade as Rhinaldo, and it was our fortune to &s;ee &s;ome &s;evere &s;ervice together. I returned about the time when A&s;tolpho ordered the Prince&s;s to court. She there became the theme of cea&s;ele&s;s admiration.</P>
<P>A&s;tolpho him&s;elf &s;eemed to adore her, when &s;uddenly, contrary to all expectati|ons
<PB N="28" REF="028486_0127_0FD9247C1E225B00">
in &s;pite of her dete&s;tation towards the object&mdash;of her prayers and &s;upplications&mdash;of the groans &s;he uttered&mdash;and the tears &s;he &s;hed at his feet&mdash;he &s;acrificed her to his &s;tern and brutal favourite, the Count St. Amand.</P>
<P>Proud, vindictive, and remor&s;ele&s;s, this man &s;eemed little &s;oftened by the beauties which inflamed him; but bore his wrech-victim to a dreary Ca&s;tle on the north of this fore&s;t, where, in &s;olitude, &s;he was left to &s;hed unavailing tears over the mi&s;erable fate to which the unaccountable partiality of a brother, who, &s;he had rea&s;on to be|lieve, loved her, had con&s;igned her a help|le&s;s prey.</P>
<P>What, alas! was my &s;ituation during this dreadful period! My de&s;pair was not to be concealed. It became &s;o marked, that the cau&s;e of it began to be whi&s;pered at court. My frantic love at length, no longer to be re&s;trained, bur&s;t forth in an act, which in|volved the object of it, as well as my&s;elf, in the mo&s;t wretched calamity.</P>
<P>I determined to obtain an interview, a la&s;t one, with the Prince&s;s, and then to &s;eek in a foreign war that death, which the peaceful &s;tate of my own country then de|nied to my wi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="028486_0128_0FD9247DA1816480">
Unhappy re&s;olution! I bribed her &s;erv|ants, and gained admittance to her pre|&s;ence. She was in her chamber, which &s;he &s;eldom quitted. I found her employed in adding &s;ome ornaments to a mantle of &s;tate which &s;he had formerly embroidered and de&s;tined for me, upon A&s;tolpho's promi&s;|ing, at her interce&s;&s;ion, to appoint me, young as I was, to the office of Knight Mar&s;hal, which is, as you well know, a po&s;t of great honour, and to which my birth a|lone, though it is not incon&s;iderable, could &s;carcely, at &s;o early a period, have entitled me.</P>
<P>She was weeping&mdash;weeping, as &s;he con|fe&s;&s;ed, in an agony of &s;orrow, as &s;oon as her re&s;entment at the ra&s;h action of which I had been guilty had &s;ub&s;ided, over the unfortunate Tancred.</P>
<P>Let me hurry over this delicious though fatal interview. I told her my re&s;olve&mdash;we were both in tears&mdash;I was kneeling at her feet, bidding her adieu, and had my lips pre&s;&s;ed to her lovely hand, which was wet with my tears, and on which I imprinted a la&s;t ki&s;s, and was ri&s;ing to tear my&s;elf away for ever&mdash;when the Count, whether appri|&s;ed by the &s;ervants I had corrupted, or in|cited by the rumours which prevailed at

<P>I was about to draw my &s;word, when I was &s;eized and di&s;armed.</P>
<P>The brutality of the Count's nature now raged uncontrouled. He drew a poignard, as if about to murder his wife in my pre|&s;ence; but a thought of a deeper revenge &s;eemed to check this purpo&s;e. He &s;miled grimly on her, and, &s;heathing the dagger, ordered me to be carried to a place of &s;e|curity.</P>
<P>We were both of us, the next morning, before the day broke, conveyed &s;ecretly to a ruinous man&s;ion, which he pa&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, &s;itu|ate on the verge of the fore&s;t, attended by him&s;elf and two &s;ervants, in whom he chief|ly confided.</P>
<P>The mi&s;eries which the unhappy A&s;pa&s;ia endured, from the &s;avage and unbridled cruelty of this mon&s;ter, during a month's confinement in that de&s;olate man&s;ion, &s;he alone can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell.</P>

<P>THE hermit &s;trove to calm the violent a|gitation, which he perceived the rela|tion of Count Tancred had rai&s;ed in his bo|&s;om, and, having &s;oothed him to &s;ome degree of tranquillity, addre&s;&s;ed him as follows:</P>
<Q><P>Alas! my &s;on, let not your rage induce you to attempt impo&s;&s;ibilities; but await 'till circum&s;tances &s;hall bereave your ene|mies of that power, of which they are now, too fatally, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="028486_0131_0FD9248355399418">
Rhodolpho is as firmly fixed as his fa|ther was in the favour of A&s;tolpho; and were another &s;i&s;ter to be &s;acrificed, dear to that monarch as was Albina, &s;he would in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly become the &s;acrifice of this connexion.</P>
<P>Of the cau&s;e of this I have learned from Rhinaldo that you are ignorant&mdash;but I do not fear to tru&s;t yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> with it. Li&s;ten then to the &s;tory I &s;hall relate:&mdash;</P>
<P>It is now about fifteen years &s;ince Lom|bardy &s;u&s;tained a lo&s;s, which it has never yet recovered, in our great and good Ema|nuel, when this half-brother A&s;tolpho a&s;|cended the throne. It was generally thought that Emanuel had peri&s;hed in a hunting par|ty, in which he was &s;aperated from his at|tendants, and in &s;pite of all tho&s;e inquiries which the anxiety of a whole people pro|moted, he was never, for the &s;pace of above fourteen years, heard of.</P>
<P>This &s;uppo&s;ition was rendered the more probable, as the part of the fore&s;t in which he was mi&s;&s;ed abounded with wolves of the large&s;t and mo&s;t ravenous kind.</P>
<P>His dauntle&s;s courage&mdash;the wi&s;dom which was di&s;played in every act of his govern|ment
<PB N="33" REF="028486_0132_0FD92485178B4478">
&mdash;the mildne&s;s and urbanity of his ad|dre&s;s and manners, rendered the lo&s;s of &s;uch a king univer&s;ally regretted. Nor was it without &s;ymptoms of gloom and di&s;&s;atisfac|tion that A&s;tolpho's title to the crown was confe&s;&s;ed; and the daughter of Emanuel, though then in the age of ab&s;olute infancy, did not want partizans, who &s;ugge&s;ted in very loud terms her right to the throne.</P>
<P>The party of A&s;tolpho, however, who was indi&s;putably brave and &s;kilful in the field, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome of tho&s;e vir|tues which allure popularity, &s;oon &s;ilenced the&s;e murmurers, and he was proclaimed king.</P>
<P>Fourteen years had elap&s;ed &s;ince the e|vent took place, when a &s;tranger, poorly glad, but of a dignified and maje&s;tic mien, arrived towards the fall of night at the pri|ory of St. Julian, and demanded of the &s;u|periour admi&s;&s;ion into the brotherhood, pledging him&s;elf to make good his claim on the &s;ucceeding day.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ary qualification for a brother of our order is, that the candidate be a knight, who has for fifteen years &s;erved his country bravely, faithfully, and without re|proach.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="028486_0133_0FD92489EC09CDC0">
The &s;tranger was pre&s;ented with &s;ome refre&s;hment after his journey, and conveyed to a cell, where he was left to repo&s;e him|&s;elf 'till the morning, when he was de&s;ired to attend the &s;uperior of the order.</P>
<P>When the &s;tranger was admitted into the pre&s;ence of the &s;uperior, he a&s;ked him "if he knew him?"</P>
<P>The old man, who had lived for above thirty years in that retirement, had lo&s;t all traces of his countenance.</P>
<P>"My father!" exclaimed the &s;tranger, "if your pupil Emanuel, who followed your &s;teps &s;o inadequately at the battle of the Bucklers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So called from a corps of infantry called Buckler Men, who fought with &s;word and target, and who&s;e gallant &s;tand under the &s;helter of their bucklers, which were exceedingly large, &s;aved the right wing of the army, commanded by the father of Emanuel in per&s;on, and turned the fortune of the day,</NOTE> &s;hould be &s;till living, might he hope protection from the brothers of St. Julian?"</P>
<P>The good old man aro&s;e from his &s;eat at the&s;e words, and approached the &s;tranger, for his eyes had begun allready to grow dim with age. He &s;urveyed him for a &s;hort

<P>Emanuel (for he was the &s;tranger) rai&s;ing the old man, folded him in his arms, and a&s;ked him whether he might confide a &s;e|cred, on which his life depended, to the re&s;t of the fathers!</P>
<P>Of this indeed he little doubted. He knew them all&mdash;for they had all been the companions of his youth, as renowned for their courage as their conduct, and he ea&s;|ily gave credit to the venerable prior, when he took upon him&s;elf to an&s;wer for their fi|delity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<Q><P>ON the day which fir&s;t beheld me torn from my kingdom, and doomed for fourteen years to a &s;tate of dreary melan|choly confinement, I was pur&s;uing the chace with my wanted eagerne&s;s, and found my|&s;elf, through the &s;wiftne&s;s of my hor&s;e, &s;e|parated from all my companions and atten|dants, except my brother A&s;tolpho, and his friend the Count St. Amand, who had changed their hor&s;es, and were thus enab|led to keep up with me.</P>
<P>After riding for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, and finding our&s;elves involved in the mo&s;t intricate part of the fore&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the &s;kill of the Count de St. Amand, who undertook to guide us, it was propo&s;ed by that nobleman that we &s;hould &s;eek refre&s;h|ment at a man&s;ion of his, which he &s;aid he was &s;ure could be at no great di&s;tance from the part of the fore&s;t in which we then were.</P>
<P>It proved, as he had conjectured, that we were near to this &s;pot, and a &s;hort time conducted us to it. It was an old building,
<PB N="37" REF="028486_0136_0FD92496566B8468">
&s;pacious, and formerly, no doubt, magni|ficent.</P>
<P>The Count apologized for the reception we were about to meet with, in a hou&s;e where he maintained but few &s;ervants, and where he &s;eldom re&s;ided. It did not, there|fore, appear &s;ingular to me to be welcomed only by a &s;ingle dome&s;tic, who received or|ders to attend to our hor&s;es, and procure us &s;ome refre&s;hment; while we were con|ducted by the Count him&s;elf to a &s;pecious apartment. There a collation was &s;oon &s;pread, and we ate like men who had rode hard all the morning.</P>
<P>After dinner the Count propo&s;ed to &s;hew us the hou&s;e, in the con&s;truction of which, old as it was, he &s;aid there were &s;ome things, de&s;erving attention.</P>
<P>After viewing many apartments, we were conducted up a &s;tairca&s;e into a &s;mall room, in which were depo&s;ited various pieces of ar|mour; from this room, &s;lipping a&s;ide a pan|nel of the wain&s;cot which concealed a door &s;trongly fortifyed with iron, the Count led us into an apartment tolerably &s;pacious, but very cloomy, furni&s;hed with a bed, and other conveniences of a &s;tately &s;tructure, but of very antique fa&s;hion.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="028486_0137_0FD9249B9D58EC98">
In this apartment I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find a man of a &s;tern ferocious countenance and a robu&s;t make, whom, though I had not much noticed him before, I &s;oon per|ceived to be the &s;ervant who had attended at our entrance. He was armed with a cui|ra&s;s, had a &s;word by his &s;ide, a dagger in his girdle, and hold a partizan in his hand. "I ob&s;erved, with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, that he did not move his hat, which he had on, at our approach; and a little alarmed at this circum&s;tance, as well as his general appear|ance, from my own defencele&s;s &s;tate, (for I had &s;et out in the morning armed only with a cutla&s;s for the chace, which I had unbuck|led and thrown a&s;ide, during our repa&s;t, af|ter the example of my brother and the Count,) I turned round to look for A&s;tol|pho, and perceived that he had not entered the room with us.</P>
<P>I had no time to wa&s;te in conjectures on this circum&s;tance. The Count &s;hut the door behind him, and, advancing towards the man, &s;eized the partizan which he held in his hand, and pointing it to my brea&s;t, &s;wore vehemently that if I ventered to &s;tir, I &s;hould die.</P>
<P>He then de&s;ired the fellow to do his du|ty, who, reaching down a pair of manacles,
<PB N="39" REF="028486_0138_0FD924A244EC0280">
which were hung to the wall, came forward to bind them on my wri&s;ts.</P>
<P>Unarmed as I was, I di&s;dained to &s;uffer this treatment tamely. I &s;eized the partiz|an which the Count held to my brea&s;t, and &s;hould &s;oon have wre&s;ted it from him, had not his a&s;&s;ociate come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and; drawing his &s;word&punc; &s;worn he would plunge it to my heart it I did not de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>I found farther re&s;i&s;tance en&s;ured my im|mediate death, and was, at lenth, obliged to &s;ubmit. My hands were manacled, and, after being a&s;&s;ured that if I proved tractable, my life would be &s;afe, and I &s;hould want for no|thing, I was left to meditate on this &s;ingular tran&s;action, the iron door being &s;ecured, as I could but too well hear, by many locks and bolts.</P>
<P>During fourteen years confinement, I ne|ver &s;aw this fellow afterwards, and have great rea&s;on to believe, from what I have been &s;ince able to learn, that my brother and the Count made him attend them to the thicke&s;t of the fore&s;t upon my hor&s;e, and there di&s;patched him and my favourite bea&s;t together, as my hor&s;es furniture, my cloak, (which in the heat of the chace I had given to the Count to carry,) and my cutla&s;s, were
<PB N="40" REF="028486_0139_0FD924A3173D5B28">
found at no con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other, in the part of the fore&s;t which the wolvesmo&s;t infe&s;t, who had probably made a meal of this fellow and his hor&s;e.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before I could &s;uffici|ently recollect my &s;cattered &s;en&s;es to &s;ur|vey the apartment in which I was confined. This, however, I at lengh did. I found it &s;upplied with every conveniency which could contribute to render confinement to|lerable.</P>

<P>I found that they had left for me &s;ome provi&s;ions, a few bottles of wine, and &s;ome of water; and, as &s;oon as the meloncholy ideas, with which my &s;ituations could not fail to impre&s;s me, would permit to think of gratifying the calls of nature, I took a &s;light repa&s;t, and throwing my&s;elf on the bed, I delivered my&s;elf to an agitated and broken &s;lumber.</P>
<P>On the next morning I examined the i|ron ca&s;ed door. To this door you a&s;cend|ed, by &s;ome &s;tone &s;teps, from the apartment.</P>
<P>In returning from this examination, which &s;till contributed to damp my hopes to e&s;cape, I found, at the bottom of the&s;e &s;teps, another door. It was very &s;trong, made of wood, and furni&s;hed with a ma&s;&s;y lock and bolts, and in the centre of it was a ma|chine,

<P>I upraided him with his treachery and di&s;loyalty, and approaching, with an intent to &s;eize him, he drew his &s;word, and &s;wore that my life &s;hould an&s;wer for any attempt on his per&s;on.</P>

<P>I was awakened one night by a terrible &s;torm&mdash;the wind &s;hook the building to its foundation&mdash;the thunder broke in deaf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing peals over my head&mdash;the lightning fla&s;hed almo&s;t without intermi&s;&s;ion, &s;o that my pri|&s;on was perfectly enlightened by its r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ys.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e from my bed, and paced my chamber, deeply meditating on the awful horrors of the night, when a fla&s;h of light|ning darted full on the building, attended by a clap of thunder &s;o terrible&punc; that I thought the tottering fabric would have fal|len at one blow in ruins to the earth.</P>

I was &s;truck down, and lay for a &s;hort time &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and upon recovering my&s;elf, was preparing again to lie down on the bed, when, ca&s;ting my eyes to the other end of the room, I was &s;truck by an object which called all my attention.</P>
<P>The &s;torm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eemed &s;omewhat to have a|bated, but, as I looked towards the corner of the room, I could perceive the lightning fla&s;hing, as I imagined, through the &s;olid wall.

<P>I removed the rubbi&s;h with an eagerne&s;s which almo&s;t fru&s;trated its own intent, and &s;queezing my body through the crevice, perceived with a rapture, which I cannot de&s;|cribe, that my e&s;cape from my pri&s;on was become almo&s;t certain, if I would hazard the attempt.</P>
<P>I fell on my knees on the &s;pot were I &s;tood, and amid the awful horrors of the &s;torm, returned thanks to that Providence whom it had plea&s;ed thus almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly to relieve me from &s;o long and melancholy an impri&s;onment.</P>

The lightning (the near approach of which I had &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt) had fallen on one of the turrets of this old man&s;ion, con|nected with the apartment in which I was confined, and having torn off the roof, the battlements, and great part of the wall, had left mo&s;t of the &s;tone &s;tairca&s;e within it en|tire.&mdash;When I got through the breach which the &s;torm had made, I found my&s;elf on one of the &s;teps of this &s;tairca&s;e which now &s;tood, undefended by any wall or bal|lu&s;trate, winding down of the out&s;ide of the building.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of it was indeed tremendous. The lightning di&s;covered to me the build|ings, and the moat beneath, at an immen&s;e di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Nothing, perhaps, le&s;s than that ardent thir&s;t for liberty, which then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could have urged me to attempt the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ignorant of what &s;teps the &s;torm might have loo&s;ened, and what di&s;placed.</P>

<P>Whether, during my confinement, any &s;ervants had been kept at this place, or whe|ther the hou&s;e had been de&s;erted. I do not know.

<P>In the morning I made my way to the cottage, who&s;e inmates, little imagining they were protecting their monarch, affor|ded me &s;helter and food.

<P>Such was the &s;tory which Emanuel related to the prior and community of St. Julian's&mdash;in the cour&s;e of which it will occur to every

<P>This was entirely owing to the &s;uper&s;tition of A&s;tolpho&mdash;a quality which is not unfre|quently attendant on the mo&s;t daring courage, tho' &s;eemingly extremely oppo&s;ite to it in its nature.</P>
<P>A&s;tolpho had been informed, early in life by an old man who pretended to be deeply ver&s;|ed in judicial a&s;trology, and who was, on that account, much re&s;pected by him, that he &s;hould not long &s;urvive his brother; and this idea, with the truth of which, as with that of all &s;uch predictions, he was fully impre&s;&s;ed, prob|ably &s;aved Emanuel's life.</P>
<P>He was willing to ri&s;que any thing but his own life, which he thought depended on Ema|nuel's, to obtain the crown.</P>
<P>He might al&s;o, perhaps, feel, in the mid&s;t of all his ambition, &s;ome degree of tenderne&s;s towards a relation, who had him&s;elf &s;hewn &s;o much affection towards him; and this con|jecture is rendered the more probable, when we reflect on his conduct towards the prince&s;s

In the cour&s;e of this pur&s;uit, the young Count Rhinaldo, who&s;e father, Count Rode|ric, &s;urnamed the Hardy, is lord of the Ca&s;tle at the foot of the mountain, and of the do|main around it, was deemed worthy to be en|tru&s;ted with this &s;ecret and important event.</P>
<P>Virtuous, enterpri&s;ing, and active, he was called by his father at the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t campaign from the bu&s;tle of the field, to partake of that retirement to which the di&s;|plea&s;ure of A&s;tolpho had condemned this for|midable le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">der.</P>
<P>Retirement at &s;uch a period of life, and with &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, but ill &s;uited the tem|per of Rhinaldo.

<P>Knights, like him&s;elf, they &s;till delighted in the tales of former times, but their ra&s;hne&s;s was tempered by experience, and their fero|city by age.</P>
<P>It was in this &s;ociety that father Anthony, (for &s;o was Emanuel called,) became acquaint|ed with him, and tho' he had been at variance with Count Roderic, who had, at a very early

period of life, imbibed &s;ome di&s;content from a conduct which he had thought partial in the king, and had &s;o behaved him&s;elf upon the di&s;covery, as totally to alienate the affections of Emanuel, yet that Prince di&s;covered &s;o much virtuous energy and early wi&s;dom in the conduct and conver&s;ation of the &s;on, that he became &s;peedily attached to him, and at length ventured to di&s;cover to him his &s;e|cret&mdash;but under a &s;olemn engagement, that he would never reveal it to his father, whom he could not prevail upon him&s;elf to confide in.</P>
<P>How was the loyalty of Rhinaldo confirmed, when he beheld in Emanuel, the father of his adored Lady I&s;abel! He pledged his faith to this revered but unfortunate &s;overeign, and became one, among a very few, entru&s;ted with a plot lately formed in the capital, which has unfortunately proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, to &s;eize upon the palace and the per&s;on of A&s;tolpho.</P>
<P>What will be the event of this attempt to re-e&s;tabli&s;h on the throne this brave but injured monarch, it is impo&s;&s;ible at pre&s;ent to decide.</P>
<P>His friends are bu&s;y in the &s;outhern and we&s;tern parts of the kingdom, and have al|ready rai&s;ed forces, which appear formidable to A&s;tolpho. At pre&s;ent that u&s;urper has a &s;uperiority at the Ca&s;tle, and has made &s;ome

vigorous attacks on the mount, which is mo&s;t re&s;olutely defended by Emanuel and my bre|thren there, who have again re&s;umed their arms. Old as I am, I had determined to join them; but it was judged that the little &s;er|vice I was able to perform in favour of a cau&s;e to which I feel &s;o &s;trong an attachment, might be, with better &s;ucce&s;s, attempted here. I have a frequent but guarded communication with them, which my &s;ituation has hitherto con|cealed from the eyes of the enemy.

<P>RHINALDO, under the di&s;gui&s;e of a &s;er|vant, became again familiarized to the apartments of his paternal man&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="028486_0151_0FD924D00CE43F48">
He was every day a witne&s;s to the increa&s;|ing favour of Rhodolpho with the u&s;urper, a circum&s;tance which excited le&s;s &s;urpri&s;e in his brea&s;t than grief and indignation. He daily heard Emanuel treated in the Court of A&s;tolpho as an impo&s;tor&mdash;a &s;lander, to which, indeed, a claim revived after a &s;ilence of four|teen years, afforded &s;ome foundation; and he was aware that Rhodolpho was probably the only man who could lay open the foulne&s;s and fal&s;ehood of &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>He was not, however, aware of one circum|&s;tance which had thrown A&s;tolpho, more compleatly than he had conjectured, into the hands of his favourite.</P>
<P>The Count St. Amand had, with that pa|ternal fondne&s;s which the wor&s;t men &s;ome|times feel, entru&s;ted his &s;on, after binding him by many oaths to a &s;trict concealment, with this important &s;ecret, as a means by which he might en&s;ure the continuance of A&s;tolpho's favour, in ca&s;e that Prince &s;hould &s;urvive the Count&mdash;but fortune had done more for him. On the night of Emanuel's e&s;|cape, he had left behind him, among other things, a book, in which he had minuted every occurrence which he thought worthy of no|tice during his long confinement.</P>
<P>As every day was much like the preceding
<PB N="53" REF="028486_0152_0FD924D0DA1DBAE0">
one, this work was not very volumnious, but it contained a &s;hort account of his arrival at the man&s;ion, and was continued at intervals nearly up to the day of his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Upon vi&s;iting the rooms after the e&s;cape of the king, the Count St. Amand found this journal, and, even amid&s;t the confu&s;ion which &s;eized upon him when he di&s;covered the e&s;|cape of his pri&s;oner, he did not forget to po&s;|&s;es him&s;elf of it.</P>
<P>This book, with annotations in many pages of it in his father's hand-writing, all combin|ing to bear te&s;timony to the truth of its con|tents, fell into the hands of Rhodolpho upon the Count's death; as did a ring which was known to be Emanuel's, and which, as it was found among the rubbi&s;h by the workmen, who repaired the ruins which the &s;torm had made, was probably lo&s;t by the king as he forced his way through the aperture in the wall in order to make his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>With &s;uch proofs in his power, (of the ex|i&s;tence of which A&s;tolpho was not ignorant,) it was of the utmo&s;t importance to that prince that he &s;hould &s;ecure to him&s;elf the good will of Rhodolpho; and the &s;ervile adolation of that young nobleman rendered this by no means a difficult or unplea&s;ant ta&s;k.</P>

<P>He puzzled him&s;elf in vain for &s;ome time, with reflexions on this &s;ingular circum&s;tance, till at la&s;t, recollecting the primary object of his pur&s;uit, he pa&s;&s;ed the loft, and entering at the oppo&s;ite door, which he &s;ound open, de|&s;cended by another &s;tairca&s;e, and &s;oon arrived at tho&s;e apartments from which the door of the gallery below had excluded him.&mdash;He pro|ceeded through two &s;mall rooms and gained a third, which joined to the apartment in which he &s;uppo&s;ed the prince&s;s to be confined.&mdash;This apartment, the la&s;t of tho&s;e which were inhabited on that &s;ide of the hou&s;e, had for|merly communicated by a &s;mall door with the room in which Rhinaldo now &s;tood; but this door had long been nailed up, and the door|way had been plai&s;tered over on the in&s;ide, to render it level with the wall, at a time when, by Count Roderic's order, the apartment had been hung with an elegant tape&s;try.&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t this door Rhinaldo li&s;tened, but could hear nothing.&mdash;He examined the fa&s;tenings, they were old

<P>Having formed this re&s;olution, he returned through the loft, and mingling with the other &s;ervants, occupied him&s;elf in the duties of his office till the hour of re&s;t approached.</P>

As he pa&s;&s;ed the door of the long gallery, in his way to the loft above it, he heard a noi&s;e, and imagining that &s;ome part of the fa|mily were yet up, he determined to enter the gallery, and wait there.&mdash;He had no &s;ooner &s;et his foot within the door-way than he felt him|&s;elf for a moment rivetted by &s;urpri&s;e to the &s;pot where he &s;tood.&mdash;The moon &s;hone in full &s;plendor thro' the windows of the gallery, and clad with an awful and &s;olemn beauty, the go|thic ornaments of the place: when, by the light it diffu&s;ed, Rhinaldo beheld, &s;eated on a chair, beneath the picture of his father, the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">igure which he had before di&s;tingui&s;hed in the loft above, and which he could now plainly perceive to be that of a man, in com|plete armour.</P>

<P>AFTER pa&s;&s;ing through the two adjacent apartments, Rhinaldo arrived at the door of the gallery which was locked, and was about to a&s;cend the &s;tairca&s;e which led to the loft above it, in order to return in his u|&s;ual way, when he again beheld the &s;ame figure on the &s;tairs, leaning with one hand again&s;t the wall.&mdash;The moon, through a &s;mall win|dow, which gave light to this part of the &s;tair|ca&s;e, di&s;clo&s;ed, compleatly, the head of this figure; in the countenance of it, Rhinaldo, from the momentary view he gained, (for at his approach the figure turned ha&s;tily from him and di&s;appeared) was convinced, that he &s;aw that of his murdered father.&mdash;The helmet was his&mdash;the plumage, the very plumage he wore when he had la&s;t attended him in the field.</P>
<P>Struck with horror at this &s;ight, he felt him|&s;elf for &s;ome moments rooted to the &s;pot where he &s;tood; but recovering him&s;elf, at length he ran ha&s;tily up the &s;tairca&s;e, and entered the lobby.&mdash;He could &s;ee nothing&mdash;he li&s;tened&mdash;all was &s;till.&mdash;In a &s;hort time he heard a mur|mer

a&s;cending from below, and the treading of &s;everal foot&s;teps, as if the inhabitants of the ca&s;tle were already &s;tirring.</P>
<P>He cro&s;&s;ed the loft, and de&s;cending into the hall, found &s;everal of A&s;tolpho's attendants, and &s;ome of the &s;ervants, who were collected in different groupes, and huddled clo&s;e toge|ther, as if li&s;tening to &s;ome dreadful tale.&mdash;He joined one of the&s;e parties, and learned, that the cau&s;e of the confu&s;ion he witne&s;&s;ed was the di&s;ordered &s;tate of the king, who had been awakened from his &s;leep in &s;uch a parox|y&s;m of horror, as to have &s;pread, by his con|duct, a general alarm.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this was not certainly known, becau&s;e, as &s;oon as he became again ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, he imputed his alarm to a dream, and ordered his attendants again to their repo&s;e; but the fir&s;t report had been, that the figure of Count Roderic, who was generally &s;u&s;pected to have been &s;lain by his order, had appeared to him compleatly armed; that it had opened his curtains, and pre&s;ented a dagger to his brea&s;t; but had, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, with a look of mingled contempt and pity, withdrawn it and di&s;appeared. This figure had been &s;een by none of the attendants in the anti-chamber, who were buried in a profound &s;leep, except one indeed, who declared that he &s;aw &s;ome|thing bru&s;h by him, and pa&s;s out at the door;
<PB N="64" REF="028486_0163_0FD924F896D82118">
but as this per&s;on had been in company with the re&s;t, drinking freely in the cour&s;e of the evening, this was generally imputed to the fumes of the liquor with which he had been indulging him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the hurry of the fir&s;t alarm Count Rho|dolpho had been &s;ent for, but that order had been now countermanded: the king had &s;ent to him, as he had done to others of his attend|ants, to tell him that he was not wanted, and had &s;hut him&s;elf up in his chamber with the captain of his guard, an approved and valiant knight.</P>
<P>Agitated by this fre&s;h intelligence, which concerned him &s;o nearly, and bore &s;o palpable a relation to the appearance which had three times encountered his &s;ight in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame evening, Rhinaldo was loft in medi|tation&mdash;his companions, dropping off one by one, left him alone in the hall; he &s;at mu&s;ing for &s;ome time; at length, no longer able to bear the accumulated pangs of the various feel|ings which a&s;&s;ailed him, he re&s;olved again to explore that part of the building where he had already beheld this &s;ingular &s;pectre; to addre&s;s it.&mdash;if it fled, to follow it.&mdash;In &s;hort, at all events, if po&s;&s;ible, to put an end to the horrid &s;u&s;pence which now oppre&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>He accordingly a&s;cended, for the third time,

to the gallery.&mdash;All there was &s;till and &s;ilent.&mdash;He again vi&s;ited the loft.&mdash;He thought he perceived &s;omething&mdash;he advanced&mdash;it was only a &s;ingular appearance at an angle of the wall, cau&s;ed by a particular direction of the moon-beam.&mdash;He pa&s;&s;ed along the loft, and began to de&s;cend by the oppo&s;ite &s;tairca&s;e.</P>
<P>He had reached the door of tho&s;e apart|ments, in one of which he had &s;o lately been at work, when he heard a noi&s;e behind him, as if on the top of the &s;tairca&s;e, near the door of the loft. He re-a&s;cended five or &s;ix &s;teps of the &s;tairca&s;e, and thought he perceived at the top of it &s;omething moving.&mdash;He was ru&s;h|ing forward to a&s;certain it, when he was &s;top|ped by loud and repeated &s;hrieks from below; they were in a female voice.&mdash;The Lady I&s;a|bel was ever pre&s;ent to his imagination. He thought the voice was her's&mdash;he li&s;tened for a moment.&mdash;His &s;u&s;picions grew &s;tronger.

<PB N="66" REF="028486_0165_0FD925021C10DC38">
the voice of I&s;abel, in a tone of terror and &s;up|plication, imploring the mercy of &s;ome per&s;on:</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid &s;he, <Q>for pity's &s;ake &s;pare me.&mdash;If I mu&s;t at la&s;t become your wife, cruel as is my de&s;tiny, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit; but for heaven's &s;ake&mdash;for your own &s;ake, do not attempt a deed which will call down accumulated vengeance on your own head.</Q></P>
<P>"I thank you," &s;aid Rhodolpho, (for it was to him that this prayer was addre&s;&s;ed) in a tone of cruel and bitter raillery, <Q>for your con&s;ent to marry me, thus un&s;olicited; while you were your uncle's pre&s;umptive heir, it was &s;omething; but your father's ra&s;h attempt has hurl'd you from his fa|vour.</Q></P>
<P>"At lea&s;t," &s;aid I&s;abel, in a more deter|mined voice; "dread the vengeance of that father! of my uncle!"</P>
<P>"As to your uncle," &s;aid Rhodolpho, in a familiar tone; <Q>my dear creature, he will never quarrel with a man for lowering your pride, in the pre&s;ent moment; and as to your father, I never fear dangers at a di&s;|tance.&mdash;Come, continued he, do not force me to har&s;h mea&s;ures.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;hrieks of the Lady I&s;abel were now

repeated. Rhinaldo, in a tran&s;port of rage and indignation, &s;etting his back again&s;t the &s;len|der fence which &s;eparated the two apartments, ea&s;ily broke through it, and lifting the tape&s;try which covered it, di&s;covered his beloved I&s;a|bel, in a night-dre&s;s, &s;truggling with Rhodol|pho.&mdash;He &s;prung upon him like a lion, and &s;eizing him with both hands by the collar, &s;oon &s;eparated him from the prince&s;s.</P>
<P>"Vile di&s;honourable coward," &s;aid he, <Q>who brave&s;t di&s;tant dangers! &s;hudder at one which has come thus unexpectedly upon thee, in the mid&s;t of thy villanies.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Ba&s;e born hind! do&s;t thou know me? &s;aid Rhodolpho.&mdash;Unhand me in&s;tantly.</Q></P>
<P>Rhinaldo &s;till held him: but perceiving that he felt about his girdle with his right|hand, he &s;eized it ju&s;t as it had gra&s;ped a dag|ger, and wrenching the weapon from him, bade him prepare to die. A &s;hriek from the Lady I&s;abel now awakened his attention; and, throwing the dagger from him, he flew tow|ards her, and conducted her, almo&s;t fainting, to a chair.</P>
<P>The apartment they were now in had been a&s;&s;igned to the Lady I&s;abel, and was u&s;ed by her as her dre&s;&s;ing-room. On one &s;ide of it was a &s;mall apartment, in which &s;tood her bed,
<PB N="68" REF="028486_0167_0FD92509D58D22B8">
connected with it, by an arched door-way, over which hung a curtain of &s;ilk, which was &s;eldom let down, as it interrupted the free pa&s;&s;age of the air.</P>
<P>Rhodolpho, to who&s;e cu&s;tody her uncle had con&s;igned her, kept the keys of her pri|&s;on, the outer apartments of which he kept &s;afely locked; and I&s;abel, relying upon their being &s;ecured, neglected to take any precau|tion with the inner ones, as much, becau&s;e &s;he thought it u&s;ele&s;s, as becau&s;e, by leaving them unfa&s;tened &s;he pre&s;erved a communication with the chambers of her cou&s;in Ellenor, and her &s;ervant Barbara, who were placed in other apartments, nearly adjacent to her's.</P>
<P>Ellenor, who had been awakened by the &s;hrieks of her cou&s;in, flew, with Barbara, to the door of her chamber; and, finding it lock'd, knock'd loud for admittance. Rhi|naldo ordered Rhodolpho to admit them, which the other did not chu&s;e to refu&s;e, but opening the door, &s;uffered them to enter, and quitted the apartment.</P>
<P>Ellenor flew to embrace her cou&s;in, and an|xiou&s;ly inquired into the cau&s;e of her alarm.&mdash;I&s;abel &s;atisfied her, and expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the obligation, under which the &s;ud|den and my&s;terious pre&s;ence and interpo&s;ition of the &s;tranger had laid her.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="028486_0168_0FD92509D78AAC20">
"Do you not, then, know me?" &s;aid Rhi|naldo, falling at her feet, and pre&s;&s;ing one of her hands to his lips.</P>
<P>The voice of Rhinaldo, now, for the fir&s;t time, &s;truck her ears; and the lamp, which burnt in her chamber, gave &s;ufficient light to enable her to di&s;tingui&s;h his countenance.</P>
<P>"Rhinaldo," &s;aid &s;he, in a voice &s;carcely audible; &s;he &s;unk into his arms; and the mo|ments flew, while the&s;e lovers gave them&s;elves up to tho&s;e cha&s;te and pure raptures, which true pa&s;&s;ion alone can yield, and which the pre|&s;ence of Ellenor, far from re&s;training, embol|dened the lovely I&s;abel to acknowledge with le&s;s re&s;erve.</P>
<P>Raptures like the&s;e were not de&s;tined to en|dure long.&mdash;Barbara fir&s;t alarmed them with the intelligence, that &s;he heard the &s;ound of foot&s;teps approaching the chamber; and Rhi|naldo in&s;tinctively flew to the door, and &s;e|cured it.</P>
<P>"Oh Rhinaldo!" exclaimed I&s;abel, <Q>I know not how you came hither; but, for hea|ven's &s;ake, if there is any mode of e&s;cape, fly from a fate, which, if you &s;hould be taken, mu&s;t doubly embitter the remaining moments of a life, already &s;ufficiently mi|&s;erable.</Q> Here &s;he bur&s;t into tears.</P>

Rhinaldo, in a tone of fixed re&s;olution, de|clared that he would remain where he was, to protect I&s;abel and her cou&s;in; but this re|&s;olution was combated with tears and intrea|ties by Ellenor, as well as I&s;abel, who repre|&s;ented to him, that after the alarm which had been given, it was impo&s;&s;ible that any imme|diate danger could accrue to I&s;abel; and, that as to any future evil, it was only by keeping him&s;elf free from di&s;covery, that he could en|tertain a hope of averting it.</P>
<P>"Fly then," &s;aid I&s;abel, the tears &s;tream|ing from her lovely eyes; "at lea&s;t for my "&s;ake."</P>
<P>This argument was, with Rhinaldo, unan|&s;werable.&mdash;They now di&s;tinctly heard many foot&s;teps in the adjacent chamber.&mdash;He em|braced I&s;abel and her cou&s;in, and ha&s;tily quit|ted the apartment by the cavity through which he had entered it.</P>

<P>RHINALDO, who did not doubt but that in a few minutes his mode of retreat would be di&s;covered, fa&s;tened the little door

after him, by the bolts which &s;till remained unimpaired, and he&s;itated for a moment what &s;tep to take. He conjectured that Rhodolpho might not have di&s;covered him, and thought that no place offered more &s;ecurity than his own chamber, if he could gain it unperceived.</P>
<P>He heard the voices of &s;everal men in I&s;a|bel's apartment, and had no longer time to he&s;itate. He moved quickly up the &s;tairs, and cro&s;&s;ing ha&s;tily thro' the loft, began to de&s;cend on the other &s;ide. He had already pa&s;&s;ed the gallery door, when he heard voices at the foot of the &s;tairs, and was enabled to di&s;tingui&s;h, among others, the&s;e words: <Q>Here is the &s;tairca&s;e which leads to that &s;ide of the hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>He returned in a moment, and a&s;cended again to the loft. The gallery door was open, and he judged that his pur&s;uers would take that way, which would compel them to return, and that he &s;hould thus gain time. They indeed entered the gallery; but in&s;tead of returning, upon finding the door &s;hut, they forced it open; and when Rhinaldo, who had in the mean time cro&s;&s;ed the loft, prepared to de&s;cend, he heard their voices at the bottom of the &s;tairca&s;e. In the utmo&s;t per|plexity, he looked anxiou&s;ly and eagerly a|round him, for an outlet; the door of the loft, on this &s;ide, opened into a &s;mall &s;quare
<PB N="72" REF="028486_0171_0FD9251489B0E178">
room, which formed a kind of landing-place, whence the &s;tairs de&s;cended. In one corner of this landing-place was a &s;mall door which opened, as Rhinaldo di&s;covered, on a narrow winding &s;tairca&s;e, leading, as it &s;eemed, to the roof of the ca&s;tle. As he had no time for choice, he began to a&s;cend; but was &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed by a noi&s;e above him, on the &s;tair|ca&s;e, he li&s;tened, and thought he heard the &s;teps of a man. A&s;toni&s;hed as he was, he con|tinued to a&s;cend, feeling his way along the wall with his hand, which at la&s;t encountered a &s;mall door; he pu&s;hed again&s;t it&mdash;it opened; but was immediately clo&s;ed by &s;ome per&s;on from the in&s;ide, and fa&s;tened.</P>
<P>Thus excluded, he was obliged to pur&s;ue his way up the &s;tairca&s;e; it ended in a narrow room, in the ceiling of which was a trap-door; but there was no ladder to enable him to reach it.&mdash;He heard a trampling in the room below. He looked round, and di&s;covered a &s;mall win|dow, the ca&s;ement of which was almo&s;t entire|ly gone.&mdash;It looked out upon the battlements, he perceived that it was ju&s;t wide enough to admit the pa&s;&s;age of his body through it.&mdash;He caught hold of a bar, which divided it is two, and &s;pringing up, thru&s;t him&s;elf, with &s;ome little difficulty, through it, and found him&s;elf on the battlements of the loftie&s;t part of the ca&s;tle.&mdash;He pur&s;ued his way along them, though he found it &s;omewhat impeded by the

ruins which had fallen from the tower above him, out of which he had e&s;caped, which was the mo&s;t ancient part of the whole edifice, and, as has been before ob&s;erved, the mo&s;t neg|lected.</P>
<P>He arrived at length at a door, leading into one of the turrets, with which the&s;e battle|ments were flanked; this turret was nearly in as ruinous a &s;tate as the tower above. And Rhinaldo, when he pu&s;hed open the door, found him&s;elf impeded by the rubbi&s;h which had fallen on the in&s;ide of it.&mdash;He entered, however, with &s;ome little difficulty, and found him&s;elf at the top of the winding &s;tairca&s;e of the turret, by which he re&s;olved to de&s;cend; it was very old and broken; the walls emitted unu&s;ual dampne&s;s; and it bore every mark of having been de&s;erted for ages.&mdash;After pur&s;u|ing this de&s;cent for a con&s;iderable time, he found him&s;elf at a kind of re&s;ting-place; this was a long narrow vaulted pa&s;&s;age, branching off to the left of the &s;tairca&s;e, which, how|ever, &s;till continued to de&s;cend.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo felt his way along this pa&s;&s;age, which, from the length of time he had already been de&s;cending, and from his arched form, he judged to be &s;ituated among the vaults un|der the ca&s;tle, and having pur&s;ued it for &s;ome time, found, at the end of it, a low door, &s;eem|ingly very &s;trong, &s;tudded with large nails,
<PB N="74" REF="028486_0173_0FD9251B18A0BFA0">
and almo&s;t choaked up with rubbi&s;h.&mdash;He now returned towards the &s;tairca&s;e of the turret&mdash;he li&s;tened, but could hear nothing of his pur|&s;uers, who, it was probable, had given up their &s;earch.&mdash;He he&s;itated whether he &s;hould re|turn or no; but curio&s;ity prompting him, he re&s;olved to explore to what profounder depth the &s;tairca&s;e extended, having already con|ducted him, as he was convinced, many feet under ground.</P>
<P>He began again to de&s;cend&mdash;the &s;tairca&s;e continued, winding downwards, till it ended in a low arched pa&s;&s;age, extending in a con|trary direction to that above.&mdash;The mouth of this pa&s;&s;age was clo&s;ed by an iron grate, which hung &s;loping towards the ground, &s;upported only by one of the hinges, (the other having given way) and the bolt on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. This grate Rhinaldo ea&s;ily throw to the ground, and entered the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>After having walked for a con&s;iderable time, and immured in total darkne&s;s, and gradually de&s;cending as he went; he thought of return|ing; but perceiving, &s;uddenly, that he began to a&s;cend, he re&s;olved again to proceed, and finding him&s;elf impelled by a curio&s;ity, which every moment intere&s;ted him more and more; he continued to move forward, feeling his way with his hands, and gradually a&s;cending, till his foot &s;truck again&s;t &s;omething, which,
<PB N="75" REF="028486_0174_0FD9251C9F343478">
upon examination, he found to be a &s;tone &s;tep; he felt with his hands, and di&s;covered that he was at the bottom of a &s;tairca&s;e, which he began to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>This &s;tairca&s;e was of con&s;iderable length, and Rhinaldo, who felt him&s;elf incommoded by the damp air of the &s;ubterraneous vault&punc; was compelled, after &s;ome time, to &s;top and re&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>After a pau&s;e, he again proceeded, and found him&s;elf at length at the &s;ummit of the &s;tairca&s;e, his farther progre&s;s being oppo&s;ed by a trap-door of great weight. Rhinaldo placed his back again&s;t this door, and after &s;ome vi|gourous attempts, he &s;ucceeded in rai&s;ing it. As it ro&s;e he felt him&s;elf almo&s;t covered with rubbi&s;h, and found, by a noi&s;e above, &s;ome|thing had been di&s;placed by his efforts.&mdash;He entered a place, damp, clo&s;e, and confined; he could not conjecture what it might be.&mdash;As he walked curiou&s;ly round it, he felt his progre&s;s impeded; he &s;tooped to di&s;cover the cau&s;e of this impediment, and his hand alight|ed on a coffin, covered with velvet, and &s;tud|ded thick with nails.</P>
<P>Wrapt in the reflexions which this &s;ingu|lar object gave ri&s;e to, he proceeded &s;lowly, till he came to a flight of &s;teps, which he a&s;|cended, and found, at the top of them, a pair
<PB N="76" REF="028486_0175_0FD92520DFF1B048">
of folding doors.&mdash;The&s;e he attempted to open, but, for a long time, in vain; at length, old, rotten, and crazy, they yielded to the vigorous and repeated efforts, which the hor|ror he conceived at being buried alive urged him to make, and he found him&s;elf within the iron railing which &s;urrounded a magnificent tomb, in a &s;mall chapel, within that belonging to the mona&s;tery of St. Julian. This place he knew (for the moon &s;till &s;hed her mellow light through the painted windows of the chapel) to be the tomb of his ance&s;tors; a privileged place of burial for the lords of the ca&s;tle, and do|main around.</P>
<P>His rapture on this di&s;covery is &s;carcely to be conceived.&mdash;He &s;aw the u&s;urper, A&s;tolpho, delivered into the hands of his gracious and rightful &s;overeign, the great and good Ema|nuel. He &s;aw his father revenged, and his prince&s;s delivered!</P>
<P>After having opened a gate in the iron rail|ing &s;urrounding the tomb, which he effected by putting his hand between the bars, and pu&s;hing back a bolt; he pa&s;&s;ed through a wick|et of the &s;ame materials, which &s;eparated the little chapel from that of the convent and en|tered the latter; but de&s;pairing of making him&s;elf heard before the chapel &s;hould be o|pened at mattins, he placed him&s;elf on a bench in the choir, and mu&s;ing on the &s;ingular ad|ventures

ventures of the evening, was at length over|taken by &s;leep.</P>
<P>He had &s;lept but a &s;hort &s;pace of time, when he was awakened by the &s;tep of &s;ome per&s;on walking &s;lowly down the ai&s;le, in which he &s;at.&mdash;What were his emotions, when he be|held, advancing towards him, the &s;ame armed figure which he had thrice before di&s;covered in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame evening!</P>
<P>He was a &s;econd time convinced that it was the armour of his father; the vizor of the helmet was up; he could no longer doubt it; the eye of his father was bent full upon him.&mdash;Rhinaldo fell on his knee, and with a mix|ture of enthu&s;ia&s;tic affection and reverential awe exclaimed:</P>
<P><Q>O &s;acred &s;hade! which beare&s;t the form of the mo&s;t honoured, the mo&s;t revered of fathers, di&s;clo&s;e, I conjure thee, the cau&s;e of this mo&s;t &s;olemn vi&s;itation.</Q></P>
<P>"Can it be Rhinaldo!" exclaimed the &s;eeming &s;pectre, in the voice of Count Rode|ric; "ari&s;e, my &s;on, and tell how it happens "that I thus encounter thee."</P>
<P>The&s;e words almo&s;t bereft Rhinaldo of his &s;en&s;es.&mdash;The &s;urpri&s;e of the moment was &s;carcely to be borne..&mdash;That the father he &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="78" REF="028486_0177_0FD92527371764C0">
murdered &s;hould thus unaccountably &s;tand before him! He &s;eemed growing to the pavement, where he kneeled.&mdash;His father &s;aw the conflict, and, advancing, rai&s;ed him from the ground, and embraced him tenderly. Rhi|naldo now recovered him&s;elf.&mdash;He fell again at the feet of his father, and &s;eizing his mailed hand, pre&s;&s;ed the cold rivets to his lips, and bedewed it with the tears of filial affection.</P>
<P>A third per&s;on now joined them, who prov|ed to be a faithful dome&s;tic of Count Roderic, named Hugo; and &s;ome time was &s;pent, be|tween the father and the &s;on, in expre&s;&s;ing their mutual &s;urpri&s;e at &s;o unexpected a meet|ing.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo having &s;eated him&s;elf by his fa|ther, gave him an account of all the circum|&s;tances which had, on his &s;ide, conduced to &s;o extraordinary an event; and when he had fini&s;hed his &s;tory, his father gratified his cu|rio&s;ity, by a &s;hort relation of the circum&s;tances which had, on his part, contributed to this &s;in|gular encounter.</P>
<P>He told him, that upon perceiving A&s;tol|pho's intentions, which though he had &s;u&s;|pected them, he did not find him&s;elf enabled to re&s;i&s;t, confirmed by his conduct when he entered the ca&s;tle; he had, him&s;elf, firmly de|termined not to quit it, but to lie concealed

till &s;ome opportunity &s;hould offer it&s;elf of re|gaining his lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or at lea&s;t of ex|ecpting vengeance on his enemies. That in order to effect this, he had recour&s;e to the ad|vice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his noble and valued friend, Leopold, who had agreed to leave the ca&s;tle, and join the forces of Emanuel (though he had not yet declared him&s;elf on his &s;ide) on the we&s;tern frontiers, clad in a &s;uit of Count Roderic's armour, and accompanied by a cho&s;en party of brave friends, who were them|&s;elves, that the deception might be more cer|tain, to be per&s;uaded that it was Roderic that accompanied them.</P>
<P>This &s;cheme &s;ucceeded but too well for Leopold, who, being taken for his friend, was pur&s;ued by the malignant hatred of A&s;tolpho, and peri&s;hed.&mdash;Count Roderic in the mean time remained &s;ecreted in the old part of the ca&s;tle, confining him&s;elf in the day time to a &s;mall room, which opened on the &s;tairca&s;e, leading to the tower, from the battlements be|low which Rhinaldo had e&s;caped.</P>
<P>He was here &s;upplied with nece&s;&s;aries by the means of his faithful dome&s;tic, Hugo, who mixed, un&s;u&s;pected, with the &s;ervants of the ca&s;tle.&mdash;From him he learned the death of his friend, and, in a tran&s;port of grief and indig|nation, formed a firm re&s;olution to revenge it. He re&s;olved, however, to delay the execution
<PB N="80" REF="028486_0179_0FD9252C56D4BA00">
of his vengeance till the time when other cir|cum&s;tances &s;hould determine him to leave the ca&s;tle. Since the period in which the conduct of A&s;tolpho had become, towards him, that of an implacable enemy, Roderic, whom, after many years of faithful &s;ervice, not even the ju&s;ter claims of Emanuel would have induced to appear in arms again&s;t the u&s;urper, &s;uffered overtures to be conveyed, through the means of Hugo, to his oppre&s;&s;ed and virtuous prince; through the &s;ame channel he received infor|mation, that a company of men at arms would quarter, on the very evening when this event|ful meeting took place, at about five miles from the ca&s;tle.&mdash;Count Roderic re&s;olved to join them; but before he executed that re|&s;olve, he determined to exact the vengeance he meditated for the murder of his friend. Hugo had bribed the centinel on the bridge, that they might be &s;uffered to pa&s;s at a more early hour than u&s;ual. Two of the Count's hor&s;es were ready in the &s;table; and it was probable, that an officer of the Count's ap|pearance, though he would &s;carcely have been permitted to enter them, might be &s;uffered to quit the lines un&s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>This would probably have been the ca&s;e, had he pur&s;ued only his de&s;ign of e&s;caping; but his mind was agitated by the hopes of ap|proaching vengeance. He was armed by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Hugo, and waited with impati|ence
<PB N="81" REF="028486_0180_0FD92534CC21AEB0">
for the hour when the centinel on the bridge &s;hould be relieved, that the man whom Hugo had bribed might take his turn; it was during this period of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, that he was thrice &s;een by Rhinaldo.</P>
<P>At length the hour approached; he de|&s;cended to the chamber where he knew A&s;tol|pho &s;lept.&mdash;He pa&s;&s;ed the anti-chamber with caution; the officers were buried in a profound &s;leep; he approached the bed of A&s;tolpho, and putting a&s;ide the curtains, drew his dagger.&mdash;A&s;tolpho awaked, and fixed his opening eyes on him till they exhibited a degree of hor|ror, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, recalled Count Roderic to him&s;elf. The u&s;urper lay &s;peech|le&s;s, under the impre&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t agoniz|ing terrors.</P>
<P>Roderic was unfit for the office of an a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;in.&mdash;He was a knight of hitherto un&s;tained reputation; the victim before him he had long obeyed as his &s;overeign.&mdash;He &s;heathed his dagger, and &s;lowly quitted the room, leaving A&s;tolpho, who was extremely &s;uper&s;titious, under a firm conviction, that the object he had beheld was the &s;pirit of the murdered Ro|deric, who had appeared to reproach him with his guilt.</P>
<P>The Count retired, as he had entered, un|mole&s;ted; and his next object was to effect
<PB N="82" REF="028486_0181_0FD9253618CED098">
his retreat from the ca&s;tle. He returned to the chamber in the &s;tairca&s;e, in &s;earch of Hu|go.&mdash;The ca&s;tle was now alarmed, and it be|came nece&s;&s;ary to wait till all &s;hould again be quiet.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of a &s;hort period the &s;earch af|ter Rhinaldo commenced, and led his pur&s;uers to the very part of the ca&s;tle in which the Count was concealed. When he heard their foot&s;teps he did not, for a moment, doubt that he was the object of their &s;earch.&mdash;He heard them at the bottom of the &s;tairca&s;e, the room in which Count Roderic was concealed, which was in the tower, communicated by a flight of narrow &s;tairs with the platform.&mdash;There was no time for he&s;itation.&mdash;The Count, accompanied by Hugo, a&s;cended, and they found them&s;elves on the loftie&s;t part of the roof of the ca&s;tle; but even here, if pur&s;ued, they mu&s;t be taken.</P>
<P>There &s;eemed no mode of e&s;cape, unle&s;s they could gain the battlements below.&mdash;They perceived, on examination, that part of the parapet had in one place fallen in, towards the battlements, and rendered the de&s;cent not very difficult; they re&s;olved to attempt it, and &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>They pur&s;ued the path which Rhinaldo had trod before them; it was, indeed the only one
<PB N="83" REF="028486_0182_0FD9253CA21F1798">
they could take; they came to the turret.&mdash;it promi&s;ed to them an a&s;ylum, as he had done to him before; they entered it; the courage of Count Roderic was as little to be daunted by the pro&s;pect of the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age as that of his &s;on, and the nece&s;&s;ity of at|tempting his e&s;cape was, perhaps, more ur|gent.</P>
<P>He entered it, accompanied by Hugo, un|con&s;cious whether it might lead him; for it had been long before his time di&s;u&s;ed, and the very knowledge of it, though palpably formed to add &s;trength to the ca&s;tle, by af|fording a communication with the mount, bu|ried in oblivion.&mdash;They arrived in the chapel at the period when Rhinaldo's fatigues had buried him in that &s;leep from which the &s;ound of his father's foot&s;teps awakened him.</P>

<P>DAY had &s;carcely begun to encroach up|on the pale light which the moon had diffu&s;ed over the venerable walls of the chapel, when the &s;acri&s;tan unbarred the door, and was &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;ight of Count Roderic and his &s;on. He conducted them, at their

de&s;ire, to the officer of the guard, in whom Rhinaldo immediately di&s;covered his friend An&s;elmo. After mutual embraces Rhinaldo informed him of the &s;ingular adventures which had led his father and him&s;elf to that &s;pot; and An&s;elmo introduced them to the pre&s;ence of Emanuel, who had already ari&s;en, and was in arms,&mdash;This gracious prince received Rhi|naldo with a cordial embrace; for he had wit|ne&s;&s;ed the virtues of this young knight, during their intimacy, while he concealed his rank, under the garb and name of Father Anthony.&mdash;To Count Roderic his demeanour was cor|dial, frank and open.</P>
<P>He had, not long before he was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his throne, by the perfidy of A&s;tolpho, conceived &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure at the conduct of Roderic, who&s;e fiery unbending &s;pirit had compelled the king at length to bani&s;h him his pre&s;ence, and the intelligence he received, upon his enlargement, that this nobleman had, for many years, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a very high de|gree, the favour and confidence of A&s;tolpho, led him to &s;u&s;pect that he was privy to the perfidy which had deprived him of his liberty and his crown. This &s;u&s;picion, unfounded, as in truth it was; for Roderic owed his ri&s;e in the court of A&s;tolpho, to his recent di&s;grace with Emanuel; and his continuance in the confidence of that u&s;urper, to his power in the &s;tate, and his conduct in the field, &s;o firmly
<PB N="85" REF="028486_0184_0FD92543DA256F88">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mind of Emanuel, that though he had learned his late di&s;grace at the court of A&s;tolpho, he did not think it &s;afe to tru&s;t him with the &s;ecret, on which, not only his hopes of again a&s;cending the throne of Lombardy, but even his very life depended. The &s;u&s;pi|cions were now wiped away; his di&s;plea&s;ure had long &s;ub&s;ided, and the daring &s;pirit, and undi&s;gui&s;ed open temper and demeanour, which had procured this nobleman the appel|lation of Roderic the Hardy, again obtained their former credit in the mind of Emanuel.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery of the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;age was made known to the king, and after a council of the knights had been called, it was agreed, that the ca&s;tle &s;hould be &s;urpri&s;ed by the means of this inlet, while every prepara|tion was made for an active and vigorous co|operation from without.</P>
<P>The ri&s;ing &s;un had not long &s;hed its golden light on the turrets of Count Roderic's Ca&s;tle, before a knight, completely armed, arrived at the gate and demanded admi&s;&s;ion to the pre|&s;ence of A&s;tolpho. As &s;oon as that prince had ari&s;en, and a council had been &s;ummoned, he was admitted. This knight, who was of a figure in which &s;trength, grace, and agility were combined, was magnificently armed, and a large &s;able plume waved on his helmet.&mdash;He advanced towards the chair in which A&s;tol|pho
<PB N="86" REF="028486_0185_0FD92583588CE980">
was &s;eated, and bending one knee to the ground, demanded ju&s;tice again&s;t a knight of his train, whom he pledged him&s;elf to prove a recreant, fal&s;e to his God, and to his king; an oppre&s;&s;or, and ba&s;e wrong-doer, towards that &s;ex which he was bound by his oath, and the order he profaned, to &s;uccour and protect.</P>
<P>A&s;tolpho promi&s;ed him the battle, and de|manded if the knight were in pre&s;ence, ur|ging him, at the &s;ame time, to &s;peak boldly, and of good heart.&mdash;The knight with the &s;a|ble plume then ri&s;ing&punc; lifted the vizor of his helmet, and di&s;covered the face of Count Tan|cred. He fixed his eyes on Rhodolpho, who &s;tood near the chair of the king and addre&s;&s;ed him thus:</P>
<P><Q>Count Rhodolpho, as thou art a knight, attend.&mdash;Thou h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lde&s;t in a rigorous and cruel captivity, if thy &s;avage rage hath not yet de&s;troyed her, the Prince&s;s A&s;pa&s;ia, the &s;i&s;ter of this injured monarch, who&s;e favour thou abu&s;e&s;t.&mdash;The truth of this I pledge my&s;elf to make good upon thy head, when, and at what weapons, (provided they be &s;uch as may become a knight) thou wilt.</Q></P>
<P>At the&s;e words Count Tancred threw down his gauntlet, which Rhodolpho took up, de|nying, with many a&s;&s;everations, but with ma|nife&s;t confu&s;ion, the truth of the charge.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="028486_0186_0FD9254813BA4718">
A&s;tolpho, in who&s;e countenance, amid&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t marks of a&s;toni&s;hment, a thou|&s;and pa&s;&s;ions &s;eemed &s;truggling for ma&s;tery, aro&s;e, and ordering the li&s;ts to be prepared, and the battle to take place on the &s;ucceeding morning, at day break, left the chamber, and the council broke up.&mdash;In the mean time, Count Tancred, who was known to many of the knights in A&s;tolpho's train, was welcomed to the ca&s;tle, and care was taken that he &s;hould be honourably treated till the next morning &s;hould arrive.</P>
<P>A&s;tolpho, in the mean time, remained in|volved in the deepe&s;t perplexity. Among his many faults, want of affection towards this &s;i&s;ter had no place. He was fond of her, and it was much again&s;t his inclination that he had felt him&s;elf compelled to &s;acrifice her to the arms of the Count St. Amand.&mdash;His indigna|tion, therefore, again&s;t Rhodolpho was rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t pitch, by the very idea, that the accu&s;ation of Count Tancred might be true; but the important &s;ecret, of which this fa|vourite was ma&s;ter, compelled him to &s;tifle his re&s;entment, and to hide in &s;miles the rage which rankled in his heart; for he well knew, that many per&s;ons of the fir&s;t con&s;equence, who at pre&s;ent &s;upported his cau&s;e, did it from a conviction, which had been artfully in&s;tilled into them, that his opponent was an impo&s;tor,
<PB N="88" REF="028486_0187_0FD9254C99B2E738">
and that Emanuel had actually peri&s;hed, as had been reported.</P>
<P>While he was mu&s;ing in his chamber, agi|tated by the&s;e reflections, he was &s;urpri&s;ed by the pre&s;ence of Rhodolpho, who had the pri|vilege of entering this apartment.&mdash;He could not readily account for this vi&s;it, at &s;uch a &s;ea|&s;on, and was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that the cau&s;e of it was the anxious de&s;ire which Rhodolpho felt to make a &s;olemn denial of the foul charge, preferred again&s;t him in the pre|&s;ence of his &s;overeign, a charge which he &s;o|lemnly averred to be founded in the mo&s;t at|trocious fal&s;hood, and the mo&s;t inveterate ma|lignity, which, he added, he did not doubt he &s;hould fully prove on the &s;ucceeding morning; prote&s;ting at the &s;ame time, with the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;everations, that he had not &s;een the Coun|te&s;s &s;ince the death of his father.</P>
<P>This declaration was graciou&s;ly received by A&s;tolpho, and was, indeed, highly grateful to him.&mdash;He was willing to believe it true; but in &s;pite of his inclination, he felt &s;ome doubts which he could not holy &s;uppre&s;s. He had long &s;u&s;pected the courage of Rhodolpho, and could &s;carcely account for his meeting this charge with &s;uch determined re&s;olution. This re&s;olution, however, if it was not a proof that he was innocent, was, at lea&s;t, a &s;trong one that he was willing to appear &s;o; a cir|cum&s;tance
<PB N="89" REF="028486_0188_0FD92551CAC52038">
which was calculated to &s;pare to A&s;tolpho much mortifying &s;elf-humiliation; nor could he help looking with &s;ome &s;ecret anxiety towards the event of the battle, which, by the death of Rhodolpho, might free him from a &s;ubject already become too powerful not to cau&s;e him much unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>RHODOLPHO, in the mean time, who had never made this declaration till he had taken a re&s;olution effectually to prevent the di&s;covery of its fal&s;hood, thought of nothing le&s;s than of meeting Count Tancred in the field.&mdash;His brain, fertile in every pro|ject of villany, had engendered the plan of preventing the combat, before he had pledged him&s;elf to A&s;tolpho, that he would &s;o ardent|ly embrace that method of proving his inno|cence, and he retired from that prince's cham|ber to give more maturity to his de&s;ign.&mdash;He knew no method of preventing the combat, which was to take place in the morning, &s;o effectual as that of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating his adver&s;ary over night; nor did his heart, at once trea|cherous, cowardly and cruel, revolt at a crime, not &s;anctioned indeed, but unhappily rendered

too frequent by the barbarous manners of the age.</P>
<P>He thought, that by the means of &s;ome worthle&s;s in&s;truments, about his per&s;on, he might be enabled to do this undi&s;covered; but at all events, &s;hould &s;u&s;picions ari&s;e, he was &s;ure of protection from A&s;tolpho. His only &s;ubject of debate now was how to accompli&s;h his infamous de&s;ign; and after &s;ome time &s;pent in deliberation, he formed the following plan:</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of his brutal and unmanner|ly attack on the defencele&s;s I&s;abel, during the preceding night that lady had &s;ent a mo&s;t ear|ne&s;t intreaty to A&s;tolpho, that if &s;he was in future to be confined, her place of confine|ment might be near to his apartments; nor did Rhodolpho, whom the &s;udden appearance, and my&s;terious e&s;cape of Rhinaldo had filled with &s;trange &s;u&s;picions and fears, oppo&s;e this reque&s;t; in con&s;equence of which the prince&s;s, together with her cou&s;in and attendant, was removed to an apartment nearly adjoining to that of A&s;tolpho.</P>
<P>Rhodolpho, who had the &s;uperintendance of the hou&s;ehold, though he could not, in this ca&s;e, act officially, ea&s;ily procured it to be intimated to the &s;teward, who &s;upplied his place, that the apartment lately quitted by the
<PB N="91" REF="028486_0190_0FD9255662141348">
prince&s;s, would afford the mo&s;t proper accom|modation for the &s;trange knight; and that a|partment was, upon this intimation, prepared for him.</P>
<P>Rhodolpho now &s;aw his enemy in his hands; he had, in the pur&s;uit of Rhinaldo, di&s;covered the door by which he had e&s;caped; an inlet to the apartment which would be effectually concealed from the un&s;u&s;pecting inhabitant by the tape&s;try. Through this door he determin|ed to give entrance, at midnight, to the ruf|fian, who had been privy to his infamous de|&s;ign on the Lady I&s;abel, and to two others of his train, whom this man pointed out as pro|per in&s;truments for the bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;The&s;e mi&s;|creants were to di&s;patch the unfortunate Count and his attendant with their daggers, while Rhodolpho, him&s;elf, waited without to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in di&s;po&s;ing of their bodies.</P>
<P>The plan being thus projected, and the hor|rid in&s;truments of his infamous de&s;ign well in&s;tructed; he &s;aw his un&s;u&s;pecting adver&s;ary retire from a &s;light meal, of which he partook with &s;ome friends, towards his apartment, for the night.&mdash;A&s;tolpho al&s;o retired to re&s;t. The tumult of the hall began, by degrees, to &s;ub|&s;ide; and all grew &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Rhodolpho alone, with a mind agitated by all the accumulated horrors which fa&s;ten on
<PB N="92" REF="028486_0191_0FD9255E93DB7F00">
a de&s;ign &s;o diabolical; yet urged by de&s;perate cowardice to the perpetration of his guilt, paced, with trembling &s;tep, the &s;till gloomy rece&s;&s;es of the ca&s;tle.&mdash;The darkne&s;s and &s;i|lence of the &s;cene &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d a double portion of terror, over his mind.</P>
<P>The clock toll'd two&mdash;this was the hour at which his accomplices had agreed to meet him&mdash;all was &s;till &s;ilent, not a &s;tep to be heard; he thought they had mi&s;taken the place of ap|pointment, and were, perhaps, already arrived at the &s;pot, which was to be the &s;cene of their infamous action.&mdash;He went up &s;tairs, pa&s;&s;ed through the gallery, and arrived at the little door; he found no per&s;on there; the door was &s;till fa&s;tened.&mdash;He had ju&s;t opened it, when he heard the foot&s;teps of &s;ome per&s;ons de&s;cending the &s;tairs, on that &s;ide of the gal|lery; they entered the apartment with cau|tious &s;ilent &s;teps.&mdash;Rhodolpho advanced to|wards them:</P>
<P><Q>Come, &s;aid he, in a low tremulous voice; you are late; the door is opened; be care|ful, but be re&s;olute. When the deed is done bring the bodies into this room, with every thing that can lead to a di&s;covery, and we will di&s;po&s;e of them.</Q></P>
<P>He had &s;carcely uttered the&s;e words, when he received the &s;word of the per&s;on he ad|dre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="93" REF="028486_0192_0FD9255E96607078">
through his body, and the voice of Rhi|naldo exclaimed, <Q>Die, mo&s;t infamous a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;in.</Q></P>
<P>Rhinaldo, with his father, and friend An&s;el|mo, had been deputed to conduct a &s;elect bo|dy of Emanuel's troops through the &s;ubterra|neous pa&s;&s;age, and they had gained the tower, undi&s;covered, at the hour when it was judged that the inhabitants of the ca&s;tle were lulled in profound repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo, to whom the &s;afety and protection of the Lady I&s;abel had been particularly in|tru&s;ted by her father, ha&s;tened, accompanied by a few friends, towards that door, which he knew communicated with her apartment when he was thus met, and thus acco&s;ted by Rho|dolpho.</P>
<P>Rhodolpho, when he received the wound, groaned and fell.</P>
<P>Rhinaldo, impre&s;&s;ed by the words of Rho|dolpho, with the utmo&s;t horror, drew his &s;word from the body, and ru&s;hing towards the door, which he found open, entered the apartment, accompanied by his attendants.&mdash;On lifting the tape&s;try&punc; he was &s;urpri&s;ed to di&s;cover, by a light which burned in the room, a per&s;on bu&s;ily employed in arranging and adju&s;ting &s;everal pieces of armour; nor was this per&s;on,
<PB N="94" REF="028486_0193_0FD92562B57C2768">
who was Count Trancred's former deliverer, le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a figure, with a &s;word im|brued with blood, advance from behind the tape&s;try.&mdash;He dropped the helmet which he held in his hand, and his &s;udden exclamations awakened his ma&s;ter. Count Tancred, who, &s;lipping on a loo&s;e robe, and &s;natching up a &s;word which lay by him, entered from his chamber.</P>
<P>The mutual &s;urpri&s;e of Rhinaldo and the Count, at this meeting, kept them, for &s;ome moments, &s;ilent.&mdash;Rhinaldo at length inform|ed his friend, in a few words, of the opera|tions of the night, and left him in the care of two of his attendants, while he him&s;elf proceeded in &s;earch of I&s;abel.</P>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily through the hall, where he had already perceived that the bu&s;ine&s;s was begun.&mdash;A party, near the &s;teps of the range of apartments, which were occupied by A&s;tol|pho, boldly, but un&s;ucce&s;sfully oppo&s;ed ano|ther, at the head of which Rhinaldo di&s;covered the plume of his father; he ru&s;hed forward to join him; the oppo&s;ite party retreated up the &s;teps towards the chambers of A&s;tolpho. When they arrived at his chamber, they found it empty; nor were they long in di&s;covering the fate of this guilty and unfortunate Prince.</P>
<P>The vi&s;ion, as he thought it, of the preceding
<PB N="95" REF="028486_0194_0FD9256613818F90">
night, had &s;o much occupied his mind, that the idea of it had, &s;ince its appearance, almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly haunted his imagination.</P>
<P>He was ob&s;erved to be thoughtful and gloo|my during the cour&s;e of the day, and when, after &s;upper, he again retired to bed, he en|deavoured in vain to compo&s;e him&s;elf to re&s;t. After &s;ome hours &s;pent in anxiety and terror, he aro&s;e, and, dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, walked about his chamber, waiting impatiently for the dawn.</P>
<P>Tired, at length, with his own thoughts, he walked into his anti-chamber&punc; where he found the officers of his guard and other attendants more alert than u&s;ual from the alarm of the preceding evening. He conver&s;ed with them at intervals for &s;ome time. During a pau&s;e in the conver&s;ation, he thought he heard the &s;ound of foot&s;teps without. The &s;tate of his mind made him awake to every &s;u&s;picion&mdash;he li&s;tened again&mdash;it was no longer to be doubted. In a fit of de&s;peration he ru&s;hed out at the head of his few attendants, and met his fate at the very fir&s;t on&s;et. He was found &s;oon afterwards in the hall covered with wounds, and deprived of every &s;ymptoms of animation.</P>
<P>After having a&s;&s;i&s;ted to beat back the party who oppo&s;ed his father, Rhinaldo, who&s;e thoughts were continually bent upon his I&s;a|bel, again detached him&s;elf with a &s;mall party
<PB N="96" REF="028486_0195_0FD9256A501297F0">
in pur&s;uit of her. From the door of a cham|ber near to A&s;tolpho's, he &s;aw three females ru&s;h forth in all the wildne&s;s of &s;udden and extreme terror.&mdash;He met them, and repeating the name of I&s;abel, &s;topped their progre&s;s.&mdash;The fir&s;t of the&s;e females pronouncing the name of Rhinaldo, ru&s;hed, as if for protec|tion, into his arms.</P>
<P>It was the Lady I&s;abel. He conducted her, with her Cou&s;in and attendant, to the apart|ment of Count Tancred, under who&s;e protec|tion he left them, that he might again join his father; but he found his pre&s;ence u&s;ele&s;s. Emanuel had on the preceding day contrived to &s;end intelligence to the party of cavalry which Count Roderic had prepared him&s;elf to join, of the plan in agitation, with orders to march in the night, and &s;urpri&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, that part of A&s;tolpho's lines, which was oppo|&s;ite to their quarters; at the &s;ame time he quitted the priory, and at the head of his cho|&s;en troops made an attack on tho&s;e po&s;ts which were the neare&s;t to him. A&s;&s;aulted at once on oppo&s;ite &s;ides, and this in the middle of the night, A&s;tolpho's troops made but a feeble re|&s;i&s;tance, and after a &s;hort &s;tand they began to give way on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>Count Roderic, in the mean time, having filled the Ca&s;tle with his followers, and &s;ecured the &s;oldiers within, who, lulled in a fatal &s;ecu|rity,
<PB N="97" REF="028486_0196_0FD9256C227EB810">
were mo&s;t of them &s;urpri&s;ed without arms, had by this mea&s;ure effectually di&s;con|certed the troops, who fled before Emanuel; for when they retreated for refuge to the Ca&s;tle, they found the drawbridge in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their enemies.</P>
<P>They threw down their arms&mdash;the gates were &s;oon opened to Emanuel, and the dawn of day &s;aw his &s;tandard di&s;played on the walls.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<P>RHINALDO had no &s;ooner &s;aluted his beloved and revered &s;overeign, and joined in the general congratulations on this &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;s, than he flew to the apartment of Count Tancred, that he might introduce his I&s;abel to a parent whom &s;he had not &s;een &s;ince the age of childhood, and whom &s;he had &s;o long lamented as dead.</P>
<P>He found the chamber empty&mdash;but, li&s;ten|ing, was attracted by the &s;ound of voices to the little room behind the tape&s;try, where he di&s;covered the Count, the Lady I&s;abel, Elle|nor, and their attendants.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="028486_0197_0FD9256DE7675760">
They were &s;urrounding a wretched man, who &s;eemed mortally wounded. He was &s;it|ting on the ground with his back again&s;t the wall, and was &s;upported on one &s;ide by one of the attendants.</P>
<P>It was Count Rhodolpho, who&s;e groans had led them from the inner chamber to the &s;pot where he lay.&mdash;When Rhinaldo entered, he was imploring the pardon of the &s;urrounding audience, but particular of Tancred, for the offences he had committed, and for the farther ones which he had meditated again&s;t them.</P>
<P>He told Count Tancred that the Prince&s;s A&s;pa&s;ia was confined in his Ca&s;tle, and, draw|ing a ring from his finger, informed him, that upon producing that token to his &s;teward, who had then the command of the Ca&s;tle, &s;he would be immediately delivered to him.</P>
<P>He confe&s;&s;ed, with much contrition, that a pa&s;&s;ion he had conceived for that lady, &s;tron|ger than that which bound him towards the Lady I&s;abel, had cau&s;ed him thus to &s;ecrete her.</P>
<P>As he was much exhau&s;ted, Rhinaldo or|dered him to be conveyed to the bed in the adjoining chamber.&mdash;This was with &s;ome dif|ficulty done.&mdash;His wound was there dre&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="99" REF="028486_0198_0FD92572336735D0">
but he died in the cour&s;e of the &s;ucceeding day.</P>
<P>Emanuel, thus re&s;tored to his throne, be|&s;towed every day fre&s;h marks of his favour on Rhinaldo and his father, who had been the in|&s;truments of this happy revolution.</P>
<P>For Rhinaldo he had long felt and long profe&s;&s;ed the affection of a father; he no &s;ooner received his long-lo&s;t daughter from his hands, than he returned her to this affectionate lover, as the brighte&s;t boon he could be&s;tow.&mdash;That &s;he was indeed &s;o, every hour which this en|viable father &s;pent in her company convinced him; and, perhaps, if he had not &s;o &s;uddenly given her to Rhinaldo, the difficulty he felt in parting with her might have inclined him to he&s;itate.</P>
<P>An&s;elmo now interceded with Rhinaldo to mention his preten&s;ions to the Lady Ellenor; nor were they for a moment di&s;regarded. E|manuel expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf happy to be enabled thus to reward the attachment of this de&s;erv|ing young nobleman.</P>
<P>The la&s;t words of the mi&s;erable Rhodolpho filled the bo&s;om of Count Tancred with a tu|mult of hopes and fears. He had no &s;ooner been introduced by his friend Rhinaldo to E|manuel, than he prepared to depart for Rho|dolpho's
<PB N="100" REF="028486_0199_0FD9257695FDC6A8">
Ca&s;tle, having obtained, in addition to the token he had received, a mandate from the king. It will be needle&s;s to de&s;cribe the rapture which attended the meeting of the&s;e lovers.</P>
<P>By the interce&s;&s;ion of Rhinaldo the Prin|ce&s;s obtained the re&s;toration of the e&s;tates of the Count St. Amand, which had been forfeit|ed; and after &s;ome time pa&s;&s;ed in widowhood, from re&s;pect to the memory of an hu&s;band, who had &s;o little de&s;erved it, &s;he rewarded the faithful attachment of Count Tancred with her hand.</P>
<P>The &s;teady and zealous &s;ervices of Rugiero were not forgotten by Rhinaldo, who obtained for him an honourable and lucrative &s;ituation. Nor did the Lady I&s;abel overlook in Barbara, the companion of her toils and her dangers; and they found, when, after a reign of many pro&s;perous years, the death of Emanuel ex|alted them to the throne of Lombardy, in the&s;e &s;teady and zealous adherents, true and loyal &s;ubjects, and firm and faithful friends.</P>
<P>The hours of adver&s;ity which Emanuel had known, had &s;trengthened his mind, which his tedious &s;olitude had much inured to habits of reflection; nor could he fail to ob&s;erve, as of|ten
<PB N="101" REF="028486_0200_0FD9257AD2F72DC8">
as he contemplated the combination of cir|cum&s;tances which had brought about a revo|lution &s;o &s;ingular, how &s;eldom, if we would wait patiently for events, we &s;hould have rea|&s;on to inveigh again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s, even in this life, attending criminal actions; and with how little con&s;tancy and fore&s;ight we are to continue to lament tho&s;e circum&s;tances as evil, which eventually, though inexplicably, produce our greate&s;t good.</P>
