<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Narrative cannot, we conceive, be injurious to any per&s;on, and to many it may be u&s;eful and edifying. The &s;implicity and frank|ne&s;s with which it is given, ought to be numbered among its recommendations.</P>
<P>The regular and re&s;pectable family to which the young woman belongs; and the wi&s;hes of her connexions, claim our attention, and induce us to give the&s;e te&s;timonials. Her life and conver&s;a|tion well agree with her Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. The bodily di&s;orders under which &s;he has labour|ed, and the exerci&s;es of her mind, have at times been very powerful and violent: But under every calamity &s;he has been remarkably patient.</P>
<P>It is not incumbent on us at this time to trace the efficient cau&s;es of her illne&s;&s;es and recoveries, nor to give any direct te&s;timony with regard to her mental exerci&s;es; but to afford &s;uch evidence to the truth of her narration as lies within our power. And we are willing to embrace this op|portunity to affirm, That the account which <HI>MARY SPAULDING</HI> gives of her&s;elf well corre&s;ponds to our own ob&s;ervation in ca&s;es within our knowl|edge, and with the declaration of the family and neighbours in other in&s;tances. But with regard to her exerci&s;es of mind, we do not pretend to
<PB N="iv" REF="029554_0003_0FE1E1129F7B8E18">determine. The&s;e lie beyond our reach. She mu&s;t &s;tand or fall before her own Ma&s;ter. But from the character &s;he has &s;u&s;tained, and from conver&s;ation with her, we are led to believe that &s;he is a per&s;on of real piety, and that &s;he means to &s;peak the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s.</P>
<P>We hope this narrative will an&s;wer all tho&s;e good effects which it is de&s;igned to produce, and that &s;he will enjoy the favour and ble&s;&s;ing of God, in who&s;e hand our breath is, and who in the mid&s;t of judgment remembers mercy.</P>

<HEAD>A Remarkable Narrative, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS it hath plea&s;ed Almighty God to vi&s;it me in years pa&s;t with much &s;ick|ne&s;s, pain and di&s;tre&s;s, at different times and in various ways, it becomes me to be hum|ble before him, and to notice all his dealings with me. And as He hath &s;een fit again to re&s;tore me to health and &s;trength in a very remarkable manner, it is my de&s;ire to make mention of his kindne&s;s, and to give glory to his great Name.</P>
<P>That I might not forget the wonderful things the Lord hath done for me, I have kept an account of the chief events which have happened to me for a number of years pa&s;t. Many of my friends and acquaint|ance have expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to have the ac|count made public; and having taken the matter under &s;erious con&s;ideration, I now think it to be my duty to let the world know what God hath done for my body, and what he hath done for my &s;oul. I &s;hall therefore proceed to give &s;ome account of my &s;ickne&s;s,
<PB N="6" REF="029554_0004_0FE1E114E8049160">and of the exerci&s;es of my mind; but &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the particulars, le&s;t I &s;hould be thought too lengthy.&mdash;</P>
<P>WHEN I was about ten years old, I dream|ed a very uncommon dream, which put me on &s;erious inquiries, and led me for a while to con&s;ider on my ways. But being young and gay, my mind was &s;oon lightened of its burden, and my &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s almo&s;t left me. The young company I kept, engaged much of my time and attention, and I was led &s;tep by &s;tep into the follies and vanities of the world. I had many calls, but I turned a deaf ear to them.</P>
<P>On the 5th of July, 1786, (being that day 17 years old) I was taken with a &s;evere fit of &s;ickne&s;s, of a nervous kind. I was reduc|ed &s;o low by this illne&s;s, that I did not ex|pect to recover; and &s;everal times the fami|ly thought I was dying; one night in partic|ular they could not perceive (as they have &s;ince told me) that I had life in me. I have often been told that for above forty nights together I was not known to &s;leep &s;o much as one hour.</P>
<P>When I had my rea&s;on, I thought death was very near, even at the door. I was told that, if I believed in Chri&s;t, I &s;hould be &s;av|ed; and I did believe that there was a God, and a Chri&s;t, and hoped that I &s;hould be &s;aved; but I did not know that I mu&s;t fir&s;t have a new heart. It however plea&s;ed God
<PB N="7" REF="029554_0004_0FE1E114E8049160">to rai&s;e me from that &s;ickne&s;s to a comforta|ble mea&s;ure of health.</P>
<P>About this time there was a reformation in <HI>We&s;tford,</HI> and I was greatly de&s;irous that there might be one in this town, and among my mates, and then I thought I would en|gage in religion. The thought of being <HI>fir&s;t</HI> was painful to me, becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;ed others would condemn and de&s;pi&s;e me for it. And therefore I concluded to put it off till a more convenient time, hoping that &s;omething would awaken the attention of people to the great things of religion. But before a more convenient &s;ea&s;on arrived, I was again &s;eized with a &s;evere illne&s;s which &s;oon deprived me of my rea&s;on. But although my rea&s;on after a few days was again re&s;tored in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, I was entirely deprived of the u&s;e of my limbs. I was unable to move hand or foot. My con&s;titution appeared to be fa&s;t debilita|ting, and I was in great pain and di&s;tre&s;s. The family once or twice thought I was breathing my la&s;t, and called in the neigh|bours to &s;ee me expire. Although I expected in a few minutes to be in eternity, death did not appear to be dre&s;&s;ed in terror. But all this time I did not know the nature of the <HI>new birth.</HI> Had I then died, what would have become of me!</P>
<P>But God was plea&s;ed to rai&s;e me from this &s;ickne&s;s, &s;o that I was comfortable, although very weak and feeble. My mind dwelt much upon the following words&mdash;<HI>Now is the ac|cepted
<PB N="8" REF="029554_0005_0FE1E11C9E27B618">time.</HI> And con&s;idering the &s;tate of my body, I thought I mu&s;t comply with the conditions of pardon <HI>now or never</HI>; that I mu&s;t make my peace with God <HI>now or never.</HI> And I often thought on tho&s;e words of our Saviour&mdash;<HI>Except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</HI> John iii.3. And I did greatly de&s;ire to know what the new birth was, and I was much in prayer, and hoped to be accepted on that account. But on the 29th of October, I was again &s;eized, and con|fined to my bed, and was &s;o delirious that I knew but little of my &s;ickne&s;s. At length, my rea&s;on having returned, I heard my Nur&s;e reading the&s;e lines, in which Chri&s;t &s;peaks to Youth:&mdash;
<Q><L>Unto thy&s;elf I will thee leave,</L>
<L>That Satan may thee wholly have:</L>
<L>Thy heart in &s;in will harden'd be,</L>
<L>And blinded in iniquity.</L></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e words &s;unk deep into my heart, and led me to a &s;en&s;e of my &s;inful &s;tate, to which I had been almo&s;t a &s;tranger. My mind was in great di&s;tre&s;s. My &s;ins appeared very nu|merous and aggravating, on every &s;ide. I looked back upon the precious time I had &s;pent in vanity, and con&s;idered how many calls and warnings I had received and &s;light|ed, the gracious offers of pardon I had neg|lected and had refu&s;ed to comply with, that I might have life. I was afraid that the of|fers which I had rejected would never again be renewed. For &s;ome time I read and
<PB N="9" REF="029554_0005_0FE1E11C9E27B618">&s;tudied my bible; but every thing I found was again&s;t me, and I laid it a&s;ide. I then took up a book, on the great concern of a preparation for death, but it would not im|part any comfort. My di&s;tre&s;s and agony of &s;oul were too great for language to ex|pre&s;s. Tho&s;e who have experienced the &s;ame can <HI>feel</HI> better than I can <HI>de&s;cribe</HI> them. When I looked up for mercy, it &s;eemed that God and Chri&s;t were turned again&s;t me. The gate of heaven appeared to be clo&s;ed, while the doors of hell &s;tood wide open to receive me. My life appeared to be very &s;hort, and my mind was heavine&s;s, and my heart was &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Reading nothing but the Dialogue between Chri&s;t and Youth, referred to above, and be|ing in a very gloomy frame of mind, my par|ents wi&s;hed to know the cau&s;e of my trouble, and what it was that took &s;uch hold of me; but I was unwilling to explain the matter, and put them off. However, the young woman who &s;lept with me in&s;i&s;ted one night that I &s;hould tell her what laboured &s;o much in my mind. Then I opened my mind to her by a&s;king this que&s;tion &mdash;If you was in a dungeon, and never expected to come out again, could you take any comfort? She re|plied, "I &s;uppo&s;e I could not." I told her then &s;he need not think &s;trange that my mind was in &s;uch a troubled &s;tate. She &s;aid&mdash;"You will not always think &s;o; put your tru&s;t in God and go to &s;leep."&mdash;The&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="029554_0006_0FE1E11F8041EB00">words increa&s;ed my di&s;tre&s;s, and I was thrown into great temptations. The chief I attempted to &s;ay was, "Lord be merciful to me a &s;inner." In this unhappy condition I remained for &s;ome time; but at length it plea&s;ed the God of all comfort to open my eyes, and give me &s;uch a view of divine things as I never before experienced. O what &s;weet views I had of Chri&s;t and of di|vine things! The pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture which crowded them&s;elves into my mind came with peculiar &s;weetne&s;s and melody; they brought joy and gladne&s;s to my heart. And if, Read|er, you wi&s;h to know what portions of holy writ had &s;uch a powerful efficacy upon me, you may at your lei&s;ure turn to Matth. vii.7, 8. and to I&s;ai. lv.6. You may al&s;o ex|amine Matth. xi.28, 29. And the&s;e texts are adapted, it &s;eems to me, to fill every thir&s;ty, longing &s;oul with joy and comfort.</P>
<P>My heart was filled with love to God and to Chri&s;t. When I con&s;idered what great things had been done for me, my thankful joy was greater than I can expre&s;s. I com|pared my&s;elf to a brand taken out of the burning. At once I was &s;et at liberty and ea&s;e. And I have often compared my &s;itua|tion to that of a per&s;on kept in a dark dun|geon, without ever &s;eeing the light, and after many years is brought &s;uddenly into a clear and bright &s;un&s;hine. By attending to this compari&s;on, any one may form &s;ome opinion
<PB N="11" REF="029554_0006_0FE1E11F8041EB00">how things appeared at that joyous moment. But all the glory is due to God for it.</P>
<P>On the 29th of December, I was taken with a fever, attended with nervous &s;ymptoms, whereby I was confined till March following. And during this &s;ickne&s;s I was brought very low, &s;o that I was unable to &s;peak a loud word for &s;everal weeks, and my phy&s;ician thought me very dangerous. But though he and all my friends almo&s;t de&s;paired of my life, I had inward joy, and it was my pre|vailing belief that I &s;hould recover. For though at &s;ome particular hours I felt almo&s;t di&s;couraged, yet in general I was confident that I &s;hould be rai&s;ed from my bed of &s;ick|ne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s. After my fir&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, I had a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion made upon my mind, one day when I was alone, that I &s;hould be &s;ick &s;everal times, and at la&s;t &s;hould recover my health. And afterwards I twice dreamed that I mu&s;t go through many trials, and that I &s;hould frequently be &s;ick, and then recover perfect health. But the impre&s;&s;ion made by the&s;e things was not &s;ufficiently deep and la&s;ting. I could not bring my mind to the firm belief that all this would happen to me. But at length my mind laboured through all the difficulties which it found in its way, and I was &s;atisfied that I &s;hould again recover &s;trength. And all the re&s;t of my &s;ickne&s;s excepting a few hours, I felt per&s;uaded that I &s;hould be rai&s;ed to health before I left the
<PB N="12" REF="029554_0007_0FE1E1211B4CB948">world. And glory be to God, I have realized what I then expected.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of my hi&s;tory does not require me to de&s;cend to particulars; and therefore I would mention in general, that from July the 5th, 1786, to July 10th, 1794, I was con|fined on the irk&s;ome bed of &s;ickne&s;s fourteen times, and &s;everal times I was viewed as a dying per&s;on, and more than once it was &s;aid of me, as I have been &s;ince told, that my breath was gone. On the 11th of Augu&s;t, 1787, I was &s;eized with the cramp in my &s;tom|ach, with other complaints. I was &s;oon &s;o fee|ble and relaxed that I could not even whi&s;per, and by moving in the mo&s;t gentle manner my bones left their &s;ockets. If a per&s;on &s;hook or even wiped my hand, the jar would di&s;place the bones of my fingers. But almo&s;t the whole time during this &s;evere illne&s;s I expected to recover. In the year 1788, on the 17th of April, a &s;ore began to di&s;cover it&s;elf in my &s;ide; and in the cour&s;e of ten weeks it gathered and broke &s;everal times, not externally, but by di&s;charging large quantities of purulent matter through the urinary pa&s;&s;ages. This &s;ickne&s;s was the mo&s;t &s;evere and painful that I had ever endured, and it continued about three months. Eight or nine weeks of the time I was rocked in a cradle day and night. It &s;eemed that &s;leep had almo&s;t departed from me. Sometimes I could &s;leep a few minutes in the morning, but I was not known to &s;leep one minute in
<PB N="13" REF="029554_0007_0FE1E1211B4CB948">night time for &s;everal weeks. But though I was extremely weak and feeble, I expected to recover, except one day when the inward &s;ore in my &s;ide was at its greate&s;t degree of &s;orene&s;s and pain, and when, as the Doctor has told me, my di&s;orders were at their cri&s;is. At this time my belief of recovery was &s;ome|what weakened; for I was unable to open my eyes or move my lips, and all the nour|i&s;hment I took was given me upon the end of a feather. But at all other periods of my &s;ickne&s;s, I was per&s;uaded that I &s;hould recov|er. And I have often thought that if a jury of Doctors and all my friends had told me there was no hope of getting well, my confi|dent per&s;ua&s;ion would have remained. Some of my friends plainly told me there was no pro&s;pect of my re&s;toration, and thought it wrong in me to indulge &s;uch an idea. They &s;aid, I mu&s;t not think that becau&s;e the Lord had done great things for me, he would do greater. To this, reply was made by &s;igns; and I replied that I was &s;en&s;ible that God had really done great things for me, and I believed he would rai&s;e me to health: but I felt my&s;elf unworthy of the lea&s;t favour from him, and I could hardly account for my be|lief. For I often thought that, if I was pre|pared for an exchange of worlds, I &s;hould prefer death to life. I was afraid, that in ca&s;e I recovered, I &s;hould be led into &s;in and wickedne&s;s; and the thoughts of &s;inning again&s;t God, were more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to me
<PB N="14" REF="029554_0008_0FE1E122B1E57BB8">than all the pains I bore. I de&s;ired, howev|er, to be re&s;igned to God's holy will, and feit grateful to him for that degree of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which I experienced in the cour&s;e of my &s;ickne&s;s. But on a certain night, (and I hope I &s;hall always remember it with humility) my bodily pains increa&s;ed to the keene&s;t torture, and I began to murmur and complain. I inquired of my&s;elf what I had done, that I mu&s;t &s;uffer &s;o much more than others round me.</P>
<P>In &s;uffering &s;uch pain and di&s;tre&s;s, with|out ea&s;e and &s;leep, I thought my affliction greater than I could bear. Then was I un|willing that God's will &s;hould be done. When in this &s;tate of mind, the following lines, in a &s;udden and powerful manner, dart|ed into my mind:
<Q><L>Why are you now in this di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>For in my bo&s;om there is re&s;t;</L>
<L>It is a place prepar'd for thee,</L>
<L>Now let your heart contented be.</L></Q>
My mind was then carried to the&s;e lines:
<Q><L>Be patient, then, frail fle&s;h,</L>
<L>In patience hold thy tongue;</L>
<L>And murmur not again&s;t the Lord,</L>
<L>As if he did thee wrong,</L>
<L>Ju&s;tice can do no wrong,</L>
<L>Nor mercy cruel be,</L>
<L>Wi&s;dom &s;ees thy &s;ad e&s;tate</L>
<L>To be the be&s;t for thee.</L></Q></P>
<P>Then I thought I could &s;ay, <HI>Lord, thy will be done.</HI> From this time I remained in a fee|ble &s;tate for a long time. I was &s;o weak and
<PB N="15" REF="029554_0008_0FE1E122B1E57BB8">relaxed, that for two years I &s;eldom or ever dre&s;&s;ed or undre&s;&s;ed me, or turned my&s;elf in bed, without putting &s;ome bone out of joint.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My &s;urgeon affirms that he replaced one of my &s;houl|ders nine times in one evening, which was di&s;located by &s;pa&s;ms.</NOTE> But the Lord was plea&s;ed to be with me, and to give me great comfort in di&s;tre&s;s. My comfort was &s;o much greater than my di&s;tre&s;s, that I never was more contented and re&s;ign|ed in all my life! And I de&s;ired to give glory to God for it, for I was as much indebted to him for my patience as I was for my breath.</P>
<P>In the year 1791, I was &s;ome better, and be|gan to gain &s;trength, and do &s;ome light work. And in 1792, I was &s;o well as &s;ometimes to do a day's work in a day. In this time, how|ever, my &s;ide was daily painful. When I took any cold, or overdid my&s;elf, it would &s;well and be very trouble&s;ome to me. Dur|ing this time I was too much taken up with the world, and did not live in &s;uch nearne&s;s to God as I ought. Engaged in vanity, I gave &s;uch a wound to religion as has cau&s;ed me many a &s;orrowful hour. But I hope I &s;hall be forgiven both by God and man. And my friends, I beg your prayers for me that I may live in greater nearne&s;s to the great and glorious God. And may we all, who have named the name of Chri&s;t, be care|ful that we re&s;olve and do the &s;ame.</P>
<P><Q><L>O, my friends; how can we bear</L>
<L>To live but even one hour here,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="029554_0009_0FE1E12F064BE870">Without we live unto the Lord,</L>
<L>According to his holy word.</L>
<L>This world allures to Satan's &s;nare;</L>
<L>Hence we mu&s;t take the greater care</L>
<L>How we do live and walk therein,</L>
<L>Le&s;t we be drawn to pride and &s;in.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the year 1793, Nov. 26, I was again &s;eized with the cramp in my &s;tomach, and was very weak and low through the following winter. But in April I rode out for my health, and unluckily fell from my hor&s;e, and &s;plit the principal bone in my right arm. On the 30th of April, I was taken with a vio|lent fever, attended with other di&s;orders. Having my arm broken, and being infe&s;ted with various di&s;orders, my outward trials and &s;ufferings were very great. But I thought I &s;hould be willing to undergo any thing, if it might be the means of making me live in greater nearne&s;s to God. The internal &s;ore in my &s;ide had gathered &s;everal times, and was then wor&s;e than ever. For more than &s;ix years, my &s;ide had been daily painful to me, and at this time the pain was very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. At length the &s;ore broke, and the pain abated, and I collected &s;trength enough to walk out and to ride &s;everal times. But on the 7th of July, my di&s;orders raged with more than double violence. I was &s;eized as was &s;up|po&s;ed, with the numb-pal&s;y over my left &s;ide; and be&s;ides this, I had an attack of the lock-jaw. My arm, hand and eye upon my left &s;ide were entirely u&s;ele&s;s, and I was unable to move my tongue. But all this time my
<PB N="17" REF="029554_0009_0FE1E12F064BE870">rea&s;on was pre&s;erved to me. And, though in a great mea&s;ure &s;en&s;ible of my &s;ituation, my mind was impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e words,&mdash; <HI>This &s;ickne&s;s &s;hall not be unto death, but for the glory of God.</HI> And I expected, that in the u&s;e of means, attended with the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, I &s;hould recover, as I had often thought before. Though I was under heavy trials, the Lord &s;eemed near to me, and &s;up|ported me under them. During this time, all the food I took was of a liquid kind, and ran between my teeth, which &s;eemed to others as well as to my&s;elf to be firmly &s;et. Under the&s;e difficulties, the &s;u&s;tenance I took was next to none. My &s;trength failed, and the pain in my jaw increa&s;ed very fa&s;t, and &s;leep almo&s;t departed. In this unhappy condition I remained till the 10th day, when, early in the morning, I gave &s;ome token to be rai&s;ed up. I was then put into a chair, in which I leaned back till my bed was made; but when I was laid down again, it &s;eemed that my &s;trength and life were almo&s;t gone. But I &s;till believed that I &s;hould recover. And while I was thinking what means could with &s;ucce&s;s be u&s;ed for my re&s;toration, and of what u&s;e health would be to me, I was led to think, (and the thought came with great pow|er,) that Chri&s;t was as able to rai&s;e me with|out means as with them, and that his power mu&s;t be exerted in either ca&s;e. I thought that if I had faith in him he could rai&s;e me to health and ea&s;e, and that I &s;hould ri&s;e
<PB N="18" REF="029554_0010_0FE1E1314A107250">&s;uddenly and walk the room. But con&s;ider|ing my di&s;orders and trials, I had no rea&s;on to expect any thing of this kind would take place; and I was at times afraid it was a &s;in to hearken to &s;uch a thought, and therefore tried to put it from me; but the more I made the attempt, the more it &s;eemed to be fixed and &s;ettled in my mind. I was led to the idea that all things are po&s;&s;ible to them that believe; and that if my faith did not fail me, I &s;hould be &s;et free from all pain and di&s;tre&s;s. My mind dwelt upon this text,&mdash;<HI>They that have faith as a grain of mu&s;tard-&s;eed, and &s;hould &s;ay to a mountain, Be thou removed into the &s;ea, nothing doubting, it &s;hould be done.</HI> And I also thought of the woman, who believed that if &s;he could touch the hem of Chri&s;t's garment, &s;he &s;hould be made whole. And other por|tions of &s;cripture of this import came to my mind with great power. And though great were the trials of my faith, it plea&s;ed Him, who over-rules all things, to bring me into a more &s;ettled belief of a &s;peedy recovery.</P>
<P>It then appeared plain to me what I &s;hould be rai&s;ed for, and it was a &s;olemn thing in|deed. It &s;eemed to me that I &s;hould be rai|&s;ed, that I might &s;peak to tho&s;e around me, <HI>to improve time better.</HI> But I was at fir&s;t un|willing to do it, and made a number of ex|cu&s;es. I thought I could not have a face to &s;peak to any, con&s;idering what a life I my|&s;elf had lived. I was &s;en&s;ible that I never could in any matter expre&s;s my ideas as I
<PB N="19" REF="029554_0010_0FE1E1314A107250">&s;hould be glad to; and I knew I was very ig|norant, and &s;o could not be capable of teach|ing others. My mind at this time was deep|ly engaged on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>My thoughts and excu&s;es which then em|ployed my attention may be found in the fourth chapter of Exodus, from the 10th to the 13th ver&s;e, and in the fir&s;t chapter of Jeremi|ah, from the 6th to the 10th ver&s;e.</P>
<P>At length I was made willing, and felt re|&s;igned to God's will. And then I laid wait|ing for the minute to come when I &s;hould ri&s;e. While thus waiting, I was thrown into great di&s;tre&s;s for breath, like a per&s;on dying. I was a&s;ked whether I was dying, and I made &s;igns that I was not; and my faith and con|fidence remained. My di&s;tre&s;s continued about half an hour, and when it was greate&s;t, my numbne&s;s, my pain and di&s;tre&s;s left me, and I immediately aro&s;e from my bed of &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;eemed to be con&s;trained to ut|ter the&s;e words;&mdash;<HI>In the name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I am commanded to ari&s;e from this bed of &s;ickne&s;s, and to walk and to prai&s;e him.</HI> I then felt free from all my infirmities. In a mo|ment I was, it &s;eemed to me, in perfect health and ea&s;e. My heart was filled with joy and with prai&s;e, to that great and glorious God who had appeared for me; and I called upon all who &s;tood by to prai&s;e the Lord with me. I de&s;ired that my Mini&s;ter and my neighbours might be &s;ent for; and when they came, they were &s;truck with great &s;urpri&s;e, and re|joiced
<PB N="20" REF="029554_0011_0FE1E132E15C3110">with me in my recovery. I de&s;ired them all to join with me in prai&s;ing the Lord for his great goodne&s;s to me. I wi&s;hed all to unite in prayer and prai&s;e to God, and re|que&s;ted the Rev. Mr. Packard to lead in our devotions. And after prayer, we &s;ang the 116th p&s;alm, fir&s;t part.</P>
<P>O how grateful and happy I felt! I can never expre&s;s the exerci&s;es of my mind, nor the grateful feelings of my heart. And I hope I &s;hall never forget the great things which God hath done for me.</P>
<P>Thus, Reader, have I attempted to give thee a true, though &s;hort, account of my various &s;ickne&s;&s;es and frequent recoveries. And my earne&s;t de&s;ire and prayer is, that thou maye&s;t love and &s;erve that God who hath been thus kind and gracious to me, and that thou may|e&s;t enjoy his favour and the rewards of his heavenly kingdom.</P>
<P>I gladly embrace this opportunity, to re|turn &s;incere thanks to my friends and neigh|bours, for their attention and kindne&s;s to me, and I hope they will be ble&s;&s;ed with the be&s;t of Heaven's ble&s;&s;ings. Come, my friends, behold and &s;ee the wonderful things which a merciful God hath done for me, who am a poor, &s;inful, unworthy worm of the du&s;t. His gracious dealings with me are more than I can utter, and therefor I wi&s;h you would &s;till join with me in prai&s;ing his holy name. And I humbly beg your prayers for me, that I may walk in the ways of religion, that I
<PB N="21" REF="029554_0011_0FE1E132E15C3110">may be weaned from every &s;in, and that I may daily grew in grace and in the knowl|edge of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. While I live, may I live in the &s;ervice and to the honour of my Maker, Pre&s;erver, and Judge.</P>
<P>I am unwilling to lay a&s;ide my pen, with|out writing a few words to my friends.&mdash;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOSE of you who have rea&s;on to think you have received the new birth, and who have begun a Chri&s;tian cour&s;e, and promi&s;ed to be for God, and to promote religion, will permit me to u&s;e freedom and plainne&s;s with you. Do not let pride and unbelief, nor the frowns and flatteries of the world, nor any temptation, prevent you from being faithful to God, and true to your Lord and Ma&s;ter. For if God be on your &s;ide, who can be and prevail again&s;t you? Let it be your &s;tudy and endeavour to bring honour to religion, and to glorify God. Plea&s;e to take an early opportunity to read 1 Corinth. xv.58. and Ephe&s;ians vi.10&mdash;19. And may the God of grace be with you, and ble&s;s you.</P>
<P>And tho&s;e of you, my friends, who are yet &s;trangers to vital religion and real holine&s;s, and who have not received the new birth, will allow me to addre&s;s you in the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s.</P>
<P>Do con&s;ider what a &s;tate you are in. Re|member what our Saviour told Nicodemus&mdash;
<PB N="22" REF="029554_0012_0FE1E13B490069B0"><HI>Except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</HI> And it is &s;aid, <HI>Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die.</HI> May you &s;oon turn, and break off your &s;ins by righteou&s;ne&s;s. Come unto Chri&s;t that you may have life; for he is ready to receive you with open arms, on the terms of the go&s;pel. And there are many calls in God's word, and many invita|tions for &s;inners to for&s;ake their &s;ins and to come to Chri&s;t. And how often are the&s;e calls repeated to youth! <HI>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth. They that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me. Seek ye the Lord while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked for&s;ake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him turn unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. A&s;k, and it &s;hall be given you; &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find; knock, and it &s;hall be opened unto you.</HI></P>
<P>May you daily &s;earch the word of God, which was given for our rule and guide, and may God give you grace to under&s;tand it, and to behave according to it. Delay not the great concerns of the &s;oul. Improve the pre&s;ent time while you have health and &s;trength, and while your rea&s;on and under|&s;tanding are pre&s;erved to you. Should you be brought to a &s;ick bed, and then look back and find that you had di&s;honoured God and neglected religion, what pain and di&s;tre&s;s would fa&s;ten on your &s;oul! Now live as you would wi&s;h you had, when you come to die.
<PB N="23" REF="029554_0012_0FE1E13B490069B0">Let it be your greate&s;t concern to get an in|tere&s;t in Chri&s;t. Con&s;ider that you are not certain of one day; and if you were certain of it, you might not have the offer of &s;alva|tion. For God &s;ays, <HI>My Spirit &s;hall not al|ways &s;trive with man. But, To-day if ye will hear my voice, harden not your heart. Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day, of &s;alvation.</HI> As the word of God calls you to attend to your &s;oul's affairs to-day, how dare you put it off till to-morrow! You know not but that to-morrow will be too late. Therefore, my friends, do not put off this great work any longer. And may God grant, for his Son's &s;ake, that you may devote your|&s;elves and all you have to the &s;ervice of God. And may you now re&s;olve, that in Chri&s;t's &s;trength, you will be for God and for no other; and take the word of God for your rule, and cry earne&s;tly to him for his Spirit, to lead you into the right way, and keep you in it. And may the God of all grace be with you, and guide you through time, and bring you at la&s;t to his heavenly kingdom.</P>
