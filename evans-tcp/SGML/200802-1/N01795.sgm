<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Papers and Pamphlets you lately &s;ent me were a very acceptable Pre&s;ent, for which I return you hearty thanks. We that live more than half a hundred Miles from Bo&s;|ton, are apt to be very fond of knowing what's a doing among you; tho' &s;ometimes after we know it, we find too much rea&s;on to lament it. So it hath happened in part to me. The plea&s;ure of a Letter from my Friend, and of learning the Remarkable occur|rences of the Town was con&s;iderably dampt by the con|cern which one of the Pamphlets gave me. I mean that Entitled, <HI>The Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State of the Town of Bo&s;ton.</HI> Not that my Per&s;onal Intere&s;t is any more affected by the Na|tions in the Pamphlet, than that of almo&s;t any ordinary man in the Province. My Intere&s;t either doth already, or will very quickly (as you well know) lye chiefly the &s;ame way with the Intere&s;t of the Author of the Pamphlet, who is (I &s;uppo&s;e) one of them that ca&s;t their Bread upon the Waters. But my trouble proceeded only from a Sincere Regard to the Publick Welfare, which I apprehend the Gentleman hath utterly mi&s;taken, &amp; even the true Inter|e&s;t of his own Town too; &amp; yet he hath &s;et his Mi&s;takes (as I take 'em to be) in &s;o plau&s;ible a light, as will be very likely to lead many others a&s;tray with him; And &s;hould the Government and Country fall into his mea&s;ures, I am greatly deceived if we &s;hould ever &s;ee good Days again, &s;o long as &s;uch mea&s;ures &s;hould be pur&s;ued. Be&s;ides, the Gentleman hath repre|&s;ented things in &s;uch a &s;mart and moving manner as
<PB N="2" REF="002128_0003_0FBC21654BFF9C08">
(I fear) will tend much to &s;tir &amp; irritate men's Pa&s;&s;ions and revive tho&s;e Heats and Animo&s;ities, which have done us too much mi&s;chief already.</P>
<P>However, I don't imagine he did this with any de&s;ign to di&s;turb the publick Peace. I &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e things lay much upon his Spirits; and therefore when he &s;et him|&s;elf to writing, his heart (unob&s;erved by him) waxed hot within him, and that naturally and almo&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily enlivened and &s;harpened his expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As to your de&s;ire of my Thoughts upon the &s;ubject, the place which I live in is &s;o remote, that I cannot be informed of the certain truth of &s;everal matters of Fact, which might &s;erve much to enlighten and direct me; but yet I am per&s;waded from the Rea&s;ons of things, that (as I &s;aid before) the Gentleman is utterly mi&s;ta|ken in his Notions of the true Intere&s;t of his Country. However, I am liable to mi&s;takes as well as he; I mu&s;t leave it therefore with you, and with any to whom you &s;hall think good to communicate my thoughts, to judge of the ju&s;tne&s;s of them, and whether my Rea&s;ons are &s;ufficient to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>In &s;etting down my thoughts, I &s;hall take notice,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Of &s;ome ill U&s;es which have been made of our Province Bills, and &s;ome unhappy Con&s;equences of making &s;uch evil u&s;es of them. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall make &s;ome Remarks upon the mo&s;t ob&s;ervable Pa&s;&s;ages in the Pamphlet it's &s;elf.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, concerning the ill U&s;es which have been made of our Province Bills, and the unhappy Con&s;equen|ces of &s;uch u&s;es.</P>
<P>When the Government fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued out our Province Bills, the <HI>Trading Part</HI> of the Country found them&s;elves furni&s;hed with a <HI>New Medium of Exchange,</HI> which would an&s;wer the ends of Trade well enough among our&s;elves: Upon this they quickly improved the Advantage put into their hands to import foreign Commodities in far greater quantities than the produce of the Country would make Returns for; and therefore they &s;oon began to export the Silver Mony pa&s;&s;ing among us to make Returns with; which Silver they bought up with the
<PB N="3" REF="002128_0004_0FBC21676A13D5D8">
<HI>new Medium</HI> which the Government had put into their hands. When by this means Silver became a little &s;carce, they were obliged to give &s;ome con&s;iderable advance in Province Bills to purcha&s;e it. And this advance became greater &s;till and greater in proportion as Silver grew more and more &s;carce. Be&s;ides, which I think &s;ome have remarked, that it received an ob&s;ervable Increa&s;e, upon the Po&s;tponing the Taxes, and the Emi&s;&s;ions of Loan Mony once and again; &s;o that it was lately at the rate of about <HI>Twelve Shillings</HI> an Ounce, and I &s;uppo&s;e it continues thereabouts &s;till.</P>
<P>Now Silver having for this Rea&s;on been re&s;erved for divers Years pa&s;t to be &s;old for Exportation, by this means Paper gradually became almo&s;t the only Medium of Exchange among our &s;elves: The very <HI>Counters</HI> which pa&s;s among us for <HI>Penies</HI> had like all to have been &s;wept away: Many of the Traders &s;ometime after the Emi&s;&s;ion of the Loan Mony (as I remember) buying them at con&s;iderable Advance in Province Bills to &s;end away, tho' they pa&s;s but for <HI>half-pence</HI> in <HI>England</HI>; &s;o vile were the <HI>Province Bills</HI> in the Eyes of the Men, who now cry, they &s;hall be undone if they have not more of them, that <HI>they would lavi&s;h them away at the rate of Twelve Shillings for an Ounce of Silver, and give four|teen Pence (as I think I have been told) &s;ome of them did for a dozen Counters, which they knew would go but for half-pence a piece abroad!</HI> And I de&s;ire to know whe|ther the <HI>very Men who turn poor Labourers and Trad<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">  men off with one half or Two Thirds Goods, can't still find Province Bills enough to purcha&s;e Silver at the rate of about Twelve Shillings an Ounce, whenever they hear of any to be &s;old?</HI> But this only by the <HI>By</HI> at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Now as the Value of Paper hath gradually &s;unk in com|pari&s;on with Silver, &s;o the Merchants have advanced upon their Goods in &s;ome proportion, and &s;o the Price of the Country's produce hath been gradually ri&s;ing al&s;o</HI>; &s;ave that thro' the abundant Ble&s;&s;ing of God upon the Hus|bandry of the Land la&s;t Year, the plenty of Provi&s;ions hath lowered the Price of it for the pre&s;ent; but had it not been for the plenty, the price of it would have
<PB N="4" REF="002128_0005_0FBC2168DFABF8A0">
been as extravagant and the &s;ale as quick as ever. &s;omething of the &s;ame nature may be &s;aid of our Oyl, which partly thro' the good Succe&s;s of our Whale-men la&s;t Winter, but more e&s;pecially by an Accident (which I forbear to mention) is &s;aid to be falling too. But as for other things which have not met with &s;ome &s;uch accident<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="7 letters">ration, as far as I can learn, their price continues as high as ever.</P>
<P>That this is a true account of the ri&s;ing of all Com|modities and Nece&s;&s;aries of Life to the extravagant price they have been at for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, is evident, <HI>becau&s;e any man might all along, and may &s;till with Silver Mony, at &s;eventeen peny weight, buy almo&s;t any Commodity or Nece&s;&s;ary, at pretty near the &s;ame rate he might before our Province Bills were first i&s;&s;ued out.</HI> I &s;ay almo&s;t any Commodity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and at pretty near the &s;ame rate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e I am &s;en&s;ible that in &s;ome things, at &s;ome times there hath been a difference e&s;pecially tho&s;e things that are proper to be exported to other Countries, as Fi&s;h, Oyl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) for which there is another manife&s;t Rea&s;on to be a&s;&s;igned, and that is this, That the Importation of foreign Commodities was for &s;ome Years &s;o va&s;t, that all the Silver our Merchants could procure, and the whole Produce of the Country be&s;ides, were not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer for it. <HI>This obliged our Merchants to catch greedily at any thing that would &s;erve to make Returns with, and this gave the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of &s;uch things an advantage to rai&s;e the price of them, even above the difference which there was between Paper and Silver.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Trading part of the Country making an ill u&s;e of the advantage which the Emi&s;&s;ion of Province Bills gave them, by importing a va&s;t quantity of needle&s;s foreign Commodities, have in the fir&s;t place found them&s;elves nece&s;&s;itated to buy up, and &s;end off all our Silver and Gold to the perplexing and almo&s;t ruining the whole Country: and &s;econdly becau&s;e The&s;e and the whole Produce of the Country together were not enough to make Returns with, therefore they have catch'd ea|gerly at every thing fit to be exported, and by doing &s;o have rais'd the price of &s;uch things: And this they have
<PB N="5" REF="002128_0006_0FBC216B65BC04D8">
done to their own Confu&s;ion, for now the price of &s;uch things is &s;o high that there is hardly any thing f<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> to be exported, that will turn to any account in other Countries; <HI>And &s;o no man knows where to make an Adven+ture, to &s;ee a new peny for an old one:</HI> Not becau&s;e there is not mony enough &s;till to purcha&s;e all the produce of the Country fit for Exportation (for if there were not, and &s;o the&s;e things lay upon the Producer's hands, I am &s;ure they would &s;oon be cheap enough) but becau&s;e we value our Paper mony &s;o little, and prize our Country's produce &s;o high, that every thing co&s;ts more pence here among our &s;elves, than it will fetch again abroad in Fo+reign Countries. Now whether Emitting more Bills be the way to encrea&s;e our Value for them, or to lower the price of our Country's Produce, I leave the World to Judge.</P>
<P>But this Mi&s;chief of &s;ending off our Silver and Gold, and rai&s;ing the Country's produce to &s;uch an extravagant price, is not all, for before the Law for &s;hortning Credit, the Gentlemen concerned in Trade (to clear their Ware|hou&s;es and Shops of Goods the fa&s;ter and make room for a new Store, and Enliven Trade) were very fond of Tru&s;ting out great quantities of Goods, with almo&s;t any Body that would take them, And I doubt the &s;ame hu|mour prevails two much &s;till. Now we &s;imple Country People being mightily pleas'd with fine things far fetcht and dear bought (&s;o long as we could have goods with|out paying ready mony for them) made no &s;cruple, many of us, to take up much more upon tru&s;t than we earnt mo|ny to pay for, hoping that a plentiful Crop of Corn or &s;ome other Smile of Providence would enable us to pay for all, one time or other. And &s;ince, when we have been dunn'd and worried by our Creditors, we have cry'd out for more mony too. Whereas the truth of the Ca&s;e is, if there had been a Million of Province Bills Emitted, we could not have paid our Debts, unle&s;s Mony had been given us, or we had &s;old or Mortgaged our Lands to procure it, for we have had nothing to &s;pare, which was worth mony, but what we have had and may &s;till have mony for (unle&s;s it be Provi&s;ion ju&s;t at this time
<PB N="6" REF="002128_0007_0FBC216CA2F81278">
by rea&s;on of the pre&s;ent plenty of it) but all we could produce hath not been near enough to di&s;charge the va&s;t Debts we had fooli&s;hly contracted.</P>
<P>And now what &s;hall be done in &s;uch unhappy Circum|&s;tances? Why, &s;ay the Traders, <HI>Do but two things and the Wheels will all be &s;et a moving again, and every Bo|dy almost will have an opportunity to improve his Talent.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Let the Act for Limitation of Credit be repeal|ed. If this be done, Country People will throng our Warehou&s;es and Shops again, and take as much on tru&s;t as ever. And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Let a private Bank be e&s;tabli&s;hed. This all hone&s;t well-meaning People will go and Mortgage their E&s;tates to, for mony to pay us for the Goods we have <HI>tru&s;ted</HI> them with: We &s;hall mo&s;t of us be Bank|ers our &s;elves, and by that means (fir&s;t) we &s;hall have mens E&s;tates mortgaged to us. And then (in the next place) we our &s;elves &s;hall get the very mony again im|mediately for which tho&s;e E&s;tates were mortgaged. When we have gotten &s;uch a fine &s;um of mony, we &s;hall &s;natch at every thing fit for Exportation more briskly than ever. This will rai&s;e the price of &s;uch things higher than it hath been yet, and then it will turn to but little Account to &s;end them el&s;ewhere; and &s;o we &s;hall complain again, <HI>that no man knows where to make an Adventure to &s;ee a new peny for an old one</HI>: Unle&s;s (per|haps) tho&s;e of us that are Bankers, &s;hould have our Mouths partly &s;topt with forfeited Mortgages, and the re&s;t of us &s;hould take better Care than we u&s;ed to do, to tru&s;t none but &s;uch as have good real E&s;tates, which will pay for all at la&s;t.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood to think, that the Author of the <HI>Distre&s;&s;ed State,</HI> &amp;c. and other Gentlemen in Trade, who wi&s;h to have the Limitation Act repealed and a private Bank e&s;tabli&s;hed, do really &s;ay, or &s;o much as think within them&s;elves, that all the above mentio|ned pernicious con&s;equences would follow thereupon. Far be it from me to imagine &s;o vile a thing of them. My opinion is, that they are &s;en&s;ible that &s;uch a Repeal and &s;uch an E&s;tabli&s;hment would give them &s;ome pre|&s;ent
<PB N="7" REF="002128_0008_0FBC216E1FA25F98">
Relief, and that they have never look'd throughly into the Train of wretched Con&s;equences which will en&s;ue.</P>
<P>I have therefore mentioned the&s;e things only as Con|&s;equences which I apprehend will unnavoidably fol|low from the natural operation of things, upon the Repeal of that Act, and the &s;etting up of a private Bank, whether Men are &s;en&s;ible of it now or not. But I believe the Con&s;equences will appear genuine to every di&s;intere&s;ted Per&s;on (as &s;oon as ever they are &s;ugge&s;ted to him) without any Argument to demon&s;trate them to be &s;o.</P>
<P N="2">2. I proceed now in the &s;econd place, to make &s;ome Remarks upon the mo&s;t ob&s;ervable Pa&s;&s;ages of the Pam|phet it's &s;elf. In doing which I &s;hall have frequent recour&s;e to the Truths already advanced.</P>
<P>Bo&s;ton, <HI>which was within the&s;e ten Years one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Towns in America, will within half &s;o many more Years be the most mi&s;erable Town,</HI> &amp;c. page 1. The flouri&s;hing of Bo&s;ton depends upon the flouri&s;hing of its Trade. The Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State of the Trade of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> is not owing to the want of Province Bills wherewith to purcha&s;e the produce of the Country to be exported on Adventures. All the produce of the Country is now bought up, and mo&s;t of it at an extravagant price too; and all the Silver and Gold be&s;ides, as fa&s;t as it comes in, by our Authors own Acknowledgment, <HI>p.</HI> 3. The Difficulty is owing therefore to the high price of the Country's produce, that it won't turn to account to &s;end it el&s;ewhere. And this is a mi&s;chief the Mer|chants have brought upon them&s;elves by the means abovementioned; and the emitting more Bills of Cre|dit will rather encrea&s;e than le&s;&s;en the evil, becau&s;e it will occa&s;ion the Value of the Bills &s;inking yet lower, and the produce of the Country ri&s;ing higher in pro|portion.</P>
<P>But if there were nothing of all this, yet I &s;hould not wonder that the Trade of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> fails now con&s;ide|rably; and I believe it will continue to do &s;o (at lea&s;t for a time) more and more. For this I think I can give two good rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="002128_0009_0FBC216F9BE2E2B0">1. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Several other Towns in this and the neigh|bouring Provinces, which during the late French War, depended chiefly upon Supplies from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and traded them&s;elves but little, and &s;ome not at all to fo|reign Parts, are now getting more and more into a foreign Trade, to the &s;upplying in good mea&s;ure not of them|&s;elves only, but of the adjacent Country al&s;o.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The extravagant Price foreign Commo|dities have been at for &s;ome years pa&s;t, hath put Coun|try People lately upon making more for them&s;elves and buying le&s;s from abroad. And this I hope they will con|tinue to do &s;till more &amp; more; for which rea&s;on I could almo&s;t wi&s;h, that the price of foreign Goods might yet continue as high as ever.</P>
<P><HI>The Medium of Exchange is &s;o exhau&s;ted, that in a little time we &s;hall not have wherewith to buy our daily Bread,</HI> p. 1. Actions &s;peak louder than Words, and with more truth and certainty. It is a certain Truth, that the greater want men feel of any thing, the more they value it, and the more loath they are to part with it. Therefore I beg you, Sir, to inform me whether your Merchants can &s;till find Province Bills to lavi&s;h away at the rate of <HI>Twelve Shillings</HI> an Ounce for Silver, when|ever they can hear of any to be &s;old. If this be the Ca&s;e (as I doubt it is, for our Author him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es, <HI>p.</HI> 3. that Silver and Gold is bought up yet, as fa&s;t as it comes in) then 'tis certain, the Merchants have Medi|um enough to carry on the &s;ame Trade &s;till, which hath hurt the Country and them&s;elves too all along, by ex|porting not only all the produce of the Country bought at an extravagant Price, but al&s;o all the Silver and Gold they can get be&s;ides, in order to bring in a needle&s;s exce&s;&s;ive quantity of foreign Commodities, or to pay for them which are already brought in. And whil&s;t this Trade is driven, 'tis vain to look for better Times. For while more is imported from other Coun|tries and con&s;umed among us, than our own produce alone can ballance, we mu&s;t continue growing poorer daily. And while there are &s;o many Province Bills &s;tanding out, as that Merchants can find their Intere&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="002128_0010_0FBC21729BBADC98">
in buying Silver with them, mo&s;t things will unna|voidably continue dear, in proportion to the difference the Merchants make between Paper and Silver.</P>
<P>And indeed if Province Bills were become &s;o &s;carce, that the Merchants cou'd not catch at the produce of the Country &s;o eagerly as to hold up the Extravagant Price of it, and &s;o had no occa&s;ion, nor indeed po&s;&s;ibilty of &s;paring them to buy Silver, I don't &s;ee that any bo|dy would be put to much greater difficulties than they are now. For if it were once come to this, that the Merchants cou'd not find their intere&s;t in exchanging Province Bills at any advance for Silver, then our Pro|vince Bills would be equally prized, and would purcha&s;e as much as Silver at <HI>&s;eventeen peny weight,</HI> as indeed they ought: And &s;o the price of all things would fall in proportion.</P>
<P>Now if by the lowering of the price of other things, Twenty Shillings will purcha&s;e me as much a while hence as Forty will now, then when &s;uch time comes, I &s;hall be able to &s;hift as well with Twenty, as I can now with Forty. So that the growing Scarcity of our Pro|vince Bills, &s;eems to be the only means to rai&s;e the Value of them, &amp; to le&s;&s;en the price of the Country's pro|duce. And when once our Bills are valued as high as Sil|ver, then the Silver and Gold, which our Author him|&s;elf acknowledges comes in, will be &s;ure to &s;tay among us; and not before. Then al&s;o the cheapne&s;s of things fit to be Exported, would &s;oon teach our Merchants where to make Adventures to &s;ee &s;omething more than a new peny for an old one.</P>
<P><HI>Next comes a complaint of the va&s;t number of Law &s;uits, of Writs out against hone&s;t Hou&s;ekeepers, who can't rai&s;e mony to pay their Debts, unle&s;s they will &s;ell their Hou&s;es at half value. And this becau&s;e they are oblig'd to work for half or two thirds Goods.</HI> With us in the Country E&s;tates are near as high in Value as ever. No man hath Hou&s;es or Lands to &s;ell, but what may have Mony for them if he be rea&s;onable in his Demands. If E&s;tates are &s;unk near half the value in Bo&s;ton, I de&s;ire to be informed, whether Numbers of Trade&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="10" REF="002128_0011_0FBC2173616D7308">
have not removed thence into the Country within the&s;e few Years? And whether by this means Tenements and Hou&s;es have not been emptied of their Inhabitants? If this be the ca&s;e, 'tis no wonder their price is fallen; for who that hath an Hou&s;e to live in him&s;elf, would buy one (for ought he knows) to &s;tand empty? Or who that has no Hou&s;e of his own, would give a great price for one, when enough others &s;tand empty ready to receive him for an ea&s;y Rent?</P>
<P>I de&s;ire al&s;o to be informed what it was that drove the&s;e Labourers and Trad&s;men out of <HI>Bo&s;ton?</HI> Whether it was not being turn'd off with half Goods, by them that &s;av'd their Bills to buy Silver, that they might &s;end for more Goods, and &s;o pay their Labourers again after the &s;ame manner? If this be &s;o, the ca&s;e of your Labourers is much to be pitied, and they would con&s;ult their own Intere&s;t if more of them would remove into the Country. We want their Labour, and &s;hould be glad to give them their Wages. We can't make the improvement of our Lands which we de&s;ire, for want of Labourers: Labourers think us obliged to them, if they will work for us at almo&s;t any rate.</P>
<P><HI>The Law which was made about Twenty Months &s;ince to &s;horten Credit, happened to be very ill timed,</HI> &amp;c. I al&s;o am of the &s;ame Opinion but for a very different rea&s;on; And I will add, not <HI>&s;o effectual</HI> as were to be wi&s;hed neither, I think not <HI>&s;o effectual,</HI> becau&s;e &s;o long a time as two Years was allow'd for tru&s;ting; and &s;o people have not been &s;ufficiently di&s;couraged from running needle&s;ly into Debt. Whereas had the time been limi|ted to but a quarter or half a Year, far the greate&s;t part of the Debts, which our Author complains men are now arre&s;ted for, had never been contracted. And I think it was ill timed, becau&s;e it was not made many Years ago: If it had, and had been made &s;o &s;trict as to have utterly prevented tru&s;ting one another in Trade, I am &s;ure the Silver and Gold could never have been &s;wept away, nor any of the Calamities we are now groaning under been brought upon us. For it is ea&s;ie to &s;ee, that if we had never tru&s;ted one another, the wor&s;t Husbands
<PB N="11" REF="002128_0012_0FBC2174E546F418">
of us all could not have &s;pent more than we earnt; for when we mu&s;t pay ready Mony for every thing we buy, we can't buy more than we earn Mony to pay for; unle&s;s we borrow Mony at Intere&s;t to &s;upport our Extra|vagance; a thing which but few would have been &s;o fooli&s;h as to have done. Indeed when Debts are already contracted, Do but &s;et up a Bank to borrow of, and we have found from &s;ad experience already, that men will be ready enough to mortgage their E&s;tates for mony to pay their Debts. But (I &s;ay again) where Debts were not before contracted, few men would have been &s;o fooli&s;h, as to borrow Mony at Intere&s;t to provide needle&s;s Fineries and Gew-Gaws for their Families. The Folly of &s;o few could not have affected the Country. Now as none of us could have &s;pent more than we earnt, had we not tru&s;ted one another, &s;o doubtle&s;s many people in the Country wou'd have been &s;o prudent as not to &s;pend &s;o much. And had &s;ome earnt more than they &s;pent, and none been in a capacity to &s;pend more than they earnt, I am &s;ure the Country in general mu&s;t have been on the thriving hand: It could not have con&s;umed &s;o much in foreign Commodi|ties, as it would have rai&s;ed of it's own Produce. The Exportation therefore would have been greater than the Importation of foreign Commodities; and &s;o Silver and Gold, in&s;tead of being exported at the rate it hath been, would have been continually coming in to make the Ballance.</P>
<P>And as, if we had never fallen into the way of Tru&s;t|ing, we &s;hould never have come into the Difficulties we now labour under, &s;o, if we cou'd all agree to leave it quite off, it would immediately begin to turn the Scales in our Favour: For when no man can con&s;ume more than the yearly product of his Husbandry, Manu+facture, Fi&s;hery, &amp;c. will furni&s;h him with mony to pay for, if at the &s;ame time there be a number of People who wont &s;pend all their yearly produce for foreign Commodities; then it is plain, that the yearly Produce of the Country mu&s;t be more than the Con&s;umption oe it; and if the yearly produce of the Country be morf
<PB N="12" REF="002128_0013_0FBC217666ABEED0">
than it's Con&s;umption, then there will be yearly a Surplu|&s;age of the Produce of the Country to be exported. For this overplus (part of our Export) it will be to no purpo&s;e to bring in foreign Commodites, becau&s;e the Country will not con&s;ume &s;uch a quantity: Therefore our Merchants mu&s;t have their Returns for this Surplu&s;age <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> our Produce in Gold or Silver, <HI>Immediately,</HI> unle&s;s they have Debts to pay fir&s;t in foreign Countries. All this (I think) is as plain and certain as a Mathematical Demon&s;tration, and I challenge any man to confute it. I dont therefore &s;ee need of any other Project. Do but wholly leave off tru&s;ting, this alone will do the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and make all things begin to go well quickly. If you object, That it is impracticable to contrive a Law &s;o as to put an utter end to Tru&s;ting; I am per|&s;waded that is a Mi&s;take. I think if I had time to en|ter upon the Argument, I could ea&s;ily tell how an effectual Stop might be put to tru&s;ting by a Law, in &s;uch a natural and nece&s;&s;ary way, as that hardly any body would ever come to &s;uffer the Penalty of it; and then certainly, no body hath any rea&s;on to fear it.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it is the Duty of Civil Rulers to con&s;ult the Welfare of the Publick. Our Legi&s;lators &s;aw the Door, at which all our Calamities have bro|ken in upon us, &s;tanding wide open: They have puffit it partly to; and &s;o have in &s;ome mea&s;ure checkt the madne&s;s of the People, who without Fear or Wit were running into Debt, to their own Ruin, and the Ruin of them that tru&s;ted them, and of the whole Country. And now whether what our Legi&s;lators did, was in|con&s;i&s;tent with Ju&s;tice and Mercy, let the World judge I am only &s;orry that the Door was not clo&s;e &s;hut and barr'd. If it had been &s;o, we &s;hou'd have felt the com|fortable effects of it before now. There would have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> no opportunity for the Oppre&s;&s;ion complain'd of p. 2. And the Mercy of the Government in hindering incon&s;iderate People from doing them&s;elves harm, would have prevented the need of Private Per&s;ons extending their Compa&s;&s;ion and forbearance to <HI>them</HI> whom they had dealt much more kindly with, if they had refu&s;ed to tru&s;t them.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002128_0014_0FBC2178E20219B8">I &s;hall add one thing more, with reference to the Limitation of Credit, which I dont remember that any of the Writers about our pre&s;ent difficulties have taken any notice of. Nothing is more certain, than that a Trade may be gainful (at lea&s;t for a time) to Merchants, which yet may prove <HI>ruinous</HI> to their Country. It is &s;aid the Trade with <HI>France</HI> would ruin <HI>England</HI> by draining it of its Mony, if the dangerous Importations from <HI>France</HI> were not di&s;couraged by exce&s;&s;ive Duties in <HI>En|gland. England</HI> being a Sovereign State, may &s;ecure it's &s;elf this way; but we who are a poor dependent Pro|vince, may not di&s;courage &s;ome Importations which we may think injurious to us, by incumbering them with heavy Duties. The only way we have to &s;ecure our &s;elves, is to put an end to Tru&s;ting, or to allow but a very &s;hort time for it. For if People may not only pay out all the Mony they earn for foreign Goods, but may al&s;o run as much into Debt as they plea&s;e be&s;ides; and if they are gotten very much into the way of doing &s;o, then it is very likely that as the Merchants have al|ready carried off all our Silver, &s;o they will in a &s;hort time make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of mo&s;t of our Lands al&s;o for Book Debts. Since we have lo&s;t our Silver, it concerns us to look well to our Lands.</P>
<P><HI>I believe by this time every Body's Belly is full of the Publick Bank,</HI> &amp;c. I wi&s;h it were &s;o; but I fear this is not the ca&s;e. I know no good that it hath done: But if I am not mi&s;taken, it hath prolong'd our Mi&s;eries, divided the Country into Parties, and given many menan Opportu|nity to involve them&s;elves wor&s;e than they were before.</P>
<P>Many of the Borrowers of the Loan Mony, and of &s;uch as have a mind to borrow, are become &s;o vain as to fancy, that <HI>that</HI> Mony will at la&s;t be paid by the Pro|vince, or el&s;e that it will never be paid at all. And tru|ly I can't tell what might be done of that nature, if Borrowers &s;hould generally have the doing of it. How|ever, I hope I &s;hall make it evident, that it is every Man's Intere&s;t, who is not a Borrower to con&s;ent to neither of the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>For the Fir&s;t, I am &s;ure it is not ju&s;t that my E&s;tate &s;hould be taxed to help <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="14" REF="002128_0015_0FBC217A21B3EA18">
voluntarily, and it may be needle&s;ly run him&s;elf into.</P>
<P>As for the &s;econd, the not paying the&s;e Bills in at all, This every Man that hath any of them in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on is concerned to look to, whether he knows it or not. And that for this rea&s;on; It is not the Governments &s;aying, This indented Bill of &s;o much, &s;hall be in value equal to Mony, and &s;o turning it into the world, which really gives it it's value (as &s;ome perhaps fondly ima|gine) but becau&s;e we know that we mu&s;t all pay Taxes, and the&s;e Bills will enable us to pay the&s;e Taxes as well or better than any thing el&s;e; therefore it is that we value the Bills yearly emitted, for defraying the Charges of the Government, and if the&s;e Taxes had never been po&s;tponed, the demand the Bills would have been in for paying Taxes, would have made us e&s;teem them at an higher rate than we do now.</P>
<P>Again, becau&s;e we know that there are good real E&s;tates laid in Pawn for all the Bills emitted by way of Loan, and becau&s;e we know that within a certain Term of Years, if we have any of the&s;e Bills in our hands, the borrowers mu&s;t certainly buy them of us at their full value to redeem their Mortgages: Therefore it is that we accept the Loan Bills, and e&s;teem them as Mony. Now if this be the truth of the Ca&s;e, then, if ever it &s;hould be enacted that the&s;e Bills &s;hould never be call'd in, they would at once lo&s;e all their value, and be worth no more to them that have them in their keeping, than &s;o many bits of Blank Paper.</P>
<P>Or if the calling in of the&s;e Bills &s;hould be deferred beyond the &s;et time, it will make men doubt whether they will ever be call'd in or not, and &s;o their value will &s;ink in proportion to the Jealou&s;ie men have about it, which will likewi&s;e be to the Lo&s;s of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them; &s;o that it is plainly the Intere&s;t of every man in the Province that is not a Borrower, and hath any of the&s;e Bills in his keeping, that they &s;hould be called in preci&s;ely at the time appointed, to redeem the E&s;tates that are laid in Pawn for them. For nothing el&s;e but this, when the time is once expired, can make
<PB N="15" REF="002128_0016_0FBC217BA077DFD8">
them as good as Mony to tho&s;e in who&s;e hands they &s;hall be at that time.</P>
<P><HI>There will be more than Three&s;core Thou&s;and Pounds to pay, and nothing to pay it with; for the Bills come in for the Interest: How then &s;hall the Principal be Paid? This is putting men on impo&s;&s;ibilities.</HI></P>
<P>This is all a great mi&s;take; and yet it is a mi&s;take al|mo&s;t every Man I meet with has fallen into, and is concerned about. If any man wou'd clear up the diffi|culty, and publi&s;h it to the World, it would tend much to quiet the Minds of People, and &s;o do good Service However, I cannot but wonder a little that tho&s;e Gentle|men who are not able to &s;olve the difficulty them&s;elves, &s;hou'd imagine the General A&s;&s;embly cou'd all be &s;o much in the dark as not to &s;ee &s;o very obvious an Objection as this, and provide again&s;t it. Sir, I have neither Law-book nor Votes of the Hou&s;e by me, and therefore I fear I &s;hall not be able to &s;olve the Diffi|culty &s;o clearly as otherwi&s;e I cou'd. However, I remem|ber that the Act for emitting the 100000 <HI>l.</HI> Loan, ex|pre&s;ly provides, <HI>That the Profits (that is the Interest) be applyed for &amp; towards the &s;upport of the Government, as the General Court &s;hall from time to time direct.</HI> Now the Intere&s;t of the Loan Mony is but 5000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, whereas, the General Court (if I mi&s;take not) hath for &s;ome Years pa&s;t granted at lea&s;t 10000 <HI>l.</HI> to defray the Char|ges of the Government; now this is the whole Intere&s;t of the Loan Mony and as much more emitted yearly. If it be objected, that when 10000 <HI>l.</HI> is granted yearly for the &s;upport of the Government, there is al&s;o at the &s;ame time a Tax granted to his Maje&s;ty in &s;ome Year to come, for calling in the&s;e Bills again. I an&s;wer, that this will create no difficulty to the Borrowers of the Loan Mony; becau&s;e the&s;e yearly Emi&s;&s;ions for the Support of the Government mu&s;t continue till the ten Years for the &s;tanding out of the Loan Money are expired: And the Taxes granted for calling in the&s;e Bills, are &s;et at &s;everal Years di&s;tance (the number of Years I dont now certainly remember,) &s;o that the very la&s;t Year of the Loan Mony, there will be Bills enough &s;tanding out,
<PB N="16" REF="002128_0017_0FBC217D1D17C4E8">
to pay not only the Intere&s;t, but al&s;o the whole Principal.</P>
<P>But there is another an&s;wer ea&s;ier to be under&s;tood than this. Some years ago, the Tax for bringing in our Province Bills was Two and Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds a year. At length the Government thought fit to ea&s;e the People of &s;o great a Burthen, and &s;o reduced the Tax to but Eleven Thou&s;and Pounds a year, and pro|po&s;ed to bring in the other half by Impo&s;t, Exci&s;e, &amp;c. After the Emi&s;&s;ion of the Loan Mony the Tax was again reduced (to what Sum I don't now remember) and the Intere&s;t of the Loan Mony was added to the Impo&s;t and Exci&s;e, to help make up the Two and Twenty Thou|&s;and Pounds, which &s;hould have been brought in by the Tax alone. So that every Year that Five Thou&s;and Pounds is paid as Intere&s;t of the Loan Mony, at the &s;ame time Five Thou&s;and Pounds which wou'd other|wi&s;e have been brought in by Tax, is left &s;tanding out. And therefore at the Ten Years end, there will be Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds &s;tanding out, which, had it not been for the Intere&s;t of the Loan Mony, would have been paid in by that time by Tax. And this the Borrowers of the Loan Mony will have to pay that part of their Principal with, which hath been drawn in by Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I hope this comes fully up to the Difficulty, and is plain enough for any Man that will but &s;et him&s;elf a thinking, to under&s;tand; and will clear the Government of the unju&s;t Imputation of being wor&s;e than the Egyp|tian Taskma&s;ters.</P>
<P><HI>We are told, we mu&s;t expect no more Bills, and Silver and Gold is bought up for the Factors as fast as it comes in, and Shipt home,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>p.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>And &s;o it always will be, while we have &s;uch plenty of Bills that the Merchants and Factors can find Advantage in doing &s;o. But I &s;hould think it prudence for the men who drive this Trade, not to li&s;p &s;o much as a word about the mi&s;eries of poor People in Bo&s;ton. I believe other Folks will think of the&s;e mi&s;eries often enough, and of the true rea&s;on of them, without being put in mind, by the Men that cau&s;e them. If our own Mer|chants are not guilty, but they are the Foreign Factors
<PB N="17" REF="002128_0018_0FBC217FD1745A70">
only that drive this Trade, let not our own Merchant join with them in a Cry for more Province Bills, and make the mi&s;eries of poor people in Bo&s;ton a Plea for it; but let them tell the world the plain Truth, That the&s;e poor People are paid in Goods for their Labour <HI>not for want of Province Bills, but becau&s;e Factors &s;ave their Province Bills to buy up Silver and Gold, as fa&s;t as it comes in, that they may &s;hip it home to their Principals&punc; and &s;o procure more Goods to pay Labourers and Trade&s;|men with: Let them tell the world, that it is by this means that Honest, Indu&s;trious People in Bo&s;ton are brought to &s;uch Extremities, as to &s;ell their Pewter and Bra&s;s to buy Food.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Gentlemen who are again&s;t emitting more Bills, think we have Mony enough; that there are two hundred thou&s;and pounds out in all the Provinces. A wonderful Ca&s;h to manage the Trade of the four Governments</HI>: &amp;c. <HI>p.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>I am my &s;elf at pre&s;ent in no Capacity to conjecture the Sum of the Bills &s;tanding out in the four Provinces; but let it be what it will, I think I am capable of proving, that there are enough of them to carry on a Trade as large, as it is for the Intere&s;t of the Provinces to have carried on. And I hope I &s;hall do this with an Ar|gument that every man can under&s;tand. There are Province Bills enough to buy up, at a rea&s;onable rate, all that can be &s;par'd of the Product of the Husbandry, Fi&s;hery, &amp;c. of the whole Country. Let them that have any of the&s;e things to &s;ell, offer them but at any thing near the rate they u&s;ed to &s;ell them for &s;ome Years ago for Silver, and I am certain they will &s;oon find Buyers, and Mony enough. Nothing will ly upon their hands, except there be &s;ome|thing not fit to be exported, which great plenty hath made a Drug of.</P>
<P>Now if there be Mony enough to buy, at a rea&s;onable rate, all the Produce of the Country that can be &s;pared, then every man that rai&s;es any thing to make Mony with, may turn it into Mony, and lay out all that Mony with Traders for foreign Commodities, if he plea&s;es. So that it is a plain Ca&s;e, that we have Bills enough &s;till to enable every Man in the Province (if they were all minded to
<PB N="18" REF="002128_0019_0FBC2180E038BBC8">
be &s;o much of Simpletons) to &s;pend all that he can earn in the Year, on Traders for foreign Commodities. And what wou'd the Traders have more? Mu&s;t Men &s;pend more than they earn? Mu&s;t publick &amp; private Banks be e&s;tabli&s;hed, that &s;o when People have &s;pent all they have earnt, they may know where to go and borrow more, to lay out for things they have no need of? And mu&s;t the Lands of the Country groan under Taxes and Mortgages to uphold the&s;e Fooleries? All this mu&s;t be done for&s;ooth! Not for fear Trade &s;hould not be large enough &s;till, but for fear it &s;hould not be &s;o large as it hath been for many Years pa&s;t, to the impoveri&s;hing and almo&s;t ruining the Coun|try. I have read but little in the Hi&s;tory and the Cu&s;toms of other Countries: Pray, Sir, inform me, whether the Governments of other Countries, u&s;e, when Traders have fool'd away all their Silver and Gold, to be &s;o very careful to provide another Medium for them, to play the Fool with again? I am apt to gue&s;s, that the Care in &s;uch Ca&s;es hath commonly been, to lay Trade under &s;uch Re&s;traints, as that it can't be carried on, but to the Advantage of its Country.</P>
<P><HI>Out own Bills are boarded up, with what noble De&s;ign I know not, but it gives room to &s;u&s;pect the worst,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>p.</HI> 4.</P>
<P>This Cry I have ob&s;erved frequently to be made at &s;ome convenient Sea&s;ons; but why Mony &s;hould be hoarded ju&s;t at &s;uch Times, or why men &s;hould hoard Mony now, that have not always made it their Cu&s;tom to do &s;o, I never could well imagine. It is commonly accounted a true Saying, that <HI>Intere&s;t will not lye</HI>; therefore I can't think that any let their Mony lye by them unim|proved, in hopes of getting their <HI>Neighbours Lands at half Value</HI>; becau&s;e I &s;ee no likelihood that &s;uch a thing will ever be effected. When once our Province Bills are by their Scarcity become equal in value to Silver, If the Government will but admit Taxes to be paid, and Mortgages to be redeemed with Silver, or the produce of the Country, tho&s;e that have hoarded up Province Bills, will be glad to break up their Hoards, and get rid of them as fa&s;t as they can, le&s;t they &s;hould become u&s;ele&s;s to them. Indeed if any Gentlemen that employ
<PB N="19" REF="002128_0020_0FBC2182918801B0">
a great number of Labourers, do (at &s;ome Sea&s;ons when it will &s;erve a Turn to have a Clamour rai&s;ed) turn off their Workmen with two thirds in&s;tead of one half Goods, or make them wait a great while for their Mo|ny part, and tell them they can't help it, the Bills are hoarded, when it may be at the &s;ame time they are buy|ing Silver with them; (I &s;ay if any do &s;o) it is plain there may be advantage in it; and &s;o there is room to <HI>&s;u&s;pect the wor&s;t</HI>; tho' I don't know that any &s;uch thing as this hath been practiced.</P>
<P><HI>The Gentlemen that cry, no more Bills, are only U&s;urers, and men who live on Salaries, Officers of the Courts and Lawyers, &amp;c. p.</HI> 4. I will add all under&s;tanding Hu&s;|bandmen, that I meet with, who have been &s;o good Husbands as not to entangle their E&s;tates.</P>
<P><HI>It is not &s;inking the Bills of Credit that will bring in Silver, &amp;c.</HI> If he had &s;aid &s;inking the Credit of the Bills it had been very ju&s;t. <HI>It must be done by going of Manufactures, &amp;c.</HI> No great matters will or can ever be done at Manufactures while Labour is &s;o dear; and La+bour will always be dear, while Bills are cheap. Ne+ce&s;&s;ity is the Mother of Invention, and will teach men more Projects as well as more Indu&s;try and Good Hus|bandry than the Emi&s;&s;ion of more Bills. I de&s;ire to be informed what Project, what Manufacture hath been &s;et on foot to any purpo&s;e, by the 50 and 100 Thou&s;and Pounds lately Emitted? <HI>The mony hath been generally Borrowed (as far as I can learn) to pay Debts contracted before, by virtue of long Credit.</HI> And if an hundred Thou&s;and Pounds more were emitted it would quickly go the &s;ame way.</P>

If any of tho&s;e Gentlemen can by writing &s;et the true Intere&s;t and Duty of the Country (at &s;uch a day as this) in a clear light, they will do God and their Country excellent Service: but I hope they will be very cautious what they deliver in the name of God from the Pulpit, about the&s;e matters of doubtful Di&s;putation which perplex the Government.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002128_0021_0FBC2184F3A48CF0"><HI>The Gentlemen who oppo&s;e the Schemes for Emitting more Bills on Land Security never propo&s;e any other, &amp;c. p.</HI> 5.</P>
<P>No Projects will &s;erve the turn, without Indu&s;try, Frugality and good Hu&s;bandry. Do but leave off Tru&s;t|ing, or &s;horten Credit as much as po&s;&s;ible, and this will make us all Indu&s;trious, Frugal, and Prudent, whether we will or not, And I believe in the way we are now in nothing el&s;e will.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;t certainly it was a very wrong &s;tep to cru&s;h the pri|vate Bank, &amp;c.</HI> I can't but hope that it will &s;till be cru&s;h't. And that for the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e &s;uch an Emi&s;&s;ion of Bills will keep their Credit always low, and that will make the produce of the Country proportionably high, that it wont turn to Account to &s;end it el&s;ewhere, and &s;o our Merchants will always be at the &s;ame Lo&s;s they are now, where to make Adventures. It will al&s;o make Labour always dear, &s;o that we &s;hall never make any great Improvement in Hu&s;|bandry or Manufactures. And at this rate Silver and Gold will always be one of the be&s;t things that we can make Returns with, and therefore will be bought up and Shipt off as fa&s;t as it comes in, and &s;o we &s;hall never get through our Difficulties.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e we have found by the unhappy Experience of the Publick Bank, that if there be but a Bank to run and borrow at, the Ill Husbandry, Vanity and Folly of the People is &s;uch; that in a &s;hort time mo&s;t of the E&s;tates in the Country would become involved; And I think it much more for the Strength, Safety, and Intere&s;t of the Country both Civil and Religious, that the E&s;tates &s;hould continue as at pre&s;ent in many mens hands, than that a few Gentlemen &s;hould be Landlords, and all the re&s;t of the Country become Tenants.</P>
<P>If you ask me why the&s;e Ill con&s;equences will follow upon a Bank in this Country rather than in England? I an&s;wer, becau&s;e as I ob&s;erv'd before, We are not a So|vereign State. We may not check an extravagant Im|portation and Con&s;umption of &s;ome foreign Commodi|ties, by heavy Duties. The only way of doing this is, by &s;hortning Credit, &s;o that People may not be able
<PB N="21" REF="002128_0022_0FBC21861DF3DCA8">
to con&s;ume more than they earn: And by not &s;uffering a Bank for People to run to, and undo them&s;elves by bor|rowing.</P>
<P N="3">3. I am again&s;t a private Bank, becau&s;e that when the Province Bills which are now out, &s;hall once be drawn in, all the Ca&s;h of the Country will then be at the direction of the Bankers. And it is ea&s;y to fore|&s;ee this Con&s;equence, that whatever Project they may have in their heads, how incon&s;i&s;tent &s;oever it may be with the publick Welfare, they wont want means to bring it to pa&s;s. Nothing will be re&s;trained from them.</P>
<P><HI>Fortifying our expo&s;ed Settlements wou'd encourage Peo|ple to Sit down and till the Earth. This would bring dawn the prices of Linen, Canvas, Provi&s;ions. p.</HI> 8. I am incli|ned to think on the contrary, that one Rea&s;on of the great &s;carcity of Provi&s;ions we have been afflicted with of late years, was that &s;o many People have gone into new Plantations, where they have not yet been able to rai&s;e their own provi&s;ions. It would conduce more to the bringing down Provi&s;ions, to have the Land already ta|ken up, better Improved by more Labourers upon it, than to have new un&s;ubdu'd Lands enter'd upon.</P>
<P>But if our Author indeed de&s;ires, that the price of the&s;e things &s;hould be brought down, why does he tell us Country People in the next Page that the want of mo|ny will lower the price of all our produce, that he may ex|cite us al&s;o to joyn with him in a cry for more Mony? The falling of our Provi&s;ions will <HI>enable him to export them to the I&s;lands as in former times. If there was a Bridge, &amp;c.</HI> The Poor who want Imployment, wou'd do bet|ter &s;ervice, to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves in Country and till the Ground.</P>
<P><HI>I hope our Friends will &s;end men &s;pirited for our Relief, to repre&s;ent them,</HI> &amp;c. I hope al&s;o Men of a Publick Spirit, and heartily concerned for the Welfare of their Country, will be &s;ent. <HI>Not Sheriffs and Lawyers,</HI> &amp;c. I will add, not Men in difficult Circum&s;tances, who have involved them&s;elves by their own Indi&s;cretion. They that can't order their private Affairs with Di&s;cretion, will make but poor Managers for the Publick. Be&s;ides,
<PB N="22" REF="002128_0023_0FBC21879FC462A0">
whatever &s;hall be propo&s;ed for the Publick Good, Men in a needy Condition will be &s;ure to con&s;ider in the fir&s;t place how it will affect them&s;elves, and if it be likely to increa&s;e their Straitne&s;s and Difficulty a little, (tho' but for a time) they had need be Men of great Inte|grity to give their Con&s;ent to it.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have given you my Thoughts with a &s;incere aim at the Good of my Country; and without prejudice or affection to any Man, or Party of men. If you think they may be of Publick Service, you have leave to make them as publick as you plea&s;e. If they are ju&s;t, no man hath rea&s;on to be angry: If they are Mi&s;takes, I shall be heartily &s;orry for it. If the Mi&s;takes are dangerous, I hope the Gentlemen who think them &s;o, will be &s;o ju&s;t to their Country as to warn it of them.</P>
<P>I have written the&s;e things in the utmo&s;t Hurry im|maginable, for fear of lo&s;ing the Opportunity to convey them. If you meet with any thing out of Place, or ex|pre&s;&s;ed too &s;harply or too ob&s;curely, impute it to my great Ha&s;t, which wont allow me to correct and alter.</P>
