<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> <DATE><HI>April</HI> 9. 1744.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY by Captain <HI>Adams</HI> from <HI>London</HI> I receiv'd Advice, which I can intirely rely upon, confirming the Hints given me in <HI>your</HI> Let|ter, that a Combination has been for &s;ome Time forming here to prevent the Act of the General Court of this Province lately pa&s;s'd <HI>for fini&s;hing the late Land Bank</HI> or <HI>Manufactory Scheme</HI> from receiving his Maje&s;ty's Royal Approbation; upon the obtaining of which, and the due Execution of the Act the putting an immediate End to the Confu&s;ion &amp; unhappy Con&s;equences of that mi&s;chievous Scheme (an Effect which all Well-wi&s;hers to the Peace of the Country de&s;ire) entirely depends.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o receiv'd undoubted Intelligence, that the late G&mdash;r <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r</HI> is deeply concern'd in this Combination with a Per&s;on here, who attempted to engage &s;ome Gentlemen of very great Di&s;tinction and Worth on your Side of the Water to u&s;e their Intete&s;t for pro|curing his Maje&s;ty's Di&s;approbation of the above-men|tion'd Act of this Government; and that authenticated Proofs of &s;ome pretended unwarrantable Proceedings of this Government relating to the Per&s;ons concern'd in the late <HI>Land Bank</HI> Scheme were to be tran&s;mitted by Mr.
<PB N="2" REF="005325_0003_1016FE589736A850">
<HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r,</HI> who was per&s;onally to repre&s;ent, the &s;ame in all their Circum&s;tances, together with the Management of &s;everal Per&s;ons therein, &s;o as that they might come to the Knowledge of the Government at Home,&mdash;that Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r'</HI>s Corre&s;pondents at Home were to prepare Mat|ters again&s;t his Arrival there; and that Letters have been forwarded to <HI>London</HI> from Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r</HI> and his Friend containing many &s;candalous Reflections and Calumnies upon this Government.</P>
<P>This Advice, <HI>Sir,</HI> tallies with the Reports, which have been openly talk'd of here and currently believ'd, concern|ing Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r'</HI>s general Views in going to <HI>London,</HI> and &s;o fully di&s;covers his Scheme in taking out of the Se|cretary's Office, under the Province Seal, Copies of all the Proceedings of this Government upon the Affairs of the late <HI>Land Bank</HI> Company, during the Time of his own and the pre&s;ent Ad&mdash;n, that it leaves no Room to doubt of the U&s;e, which he de&s;igns to make of tho&s;e Papers, and how capable he is of repre&s;enting both his own and his Suc&mdash;r's Proceedings in a fal&s;e Light.&mdash;Wherefore as you are &s;o good, <HI>Sir,</HI> as to offer the Continuance of your Service to the Country for di&s;appointing the pa&s;t and future Machinations of the honourable <HI>Gentleman</HI> and his <HI>A&s;&s;ociate</HI> for perpetuating (as far as in them lies) the ma|lignant Effects of the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Scheme in the Province; and for defeating all their &s;ecret Attempts on your Side of the Water to mi&s;repre&s;ent and traduce the Acts of this Government, and to engage Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Honour and Worth to u&s;e their Intere&s;t to the Prejudice of it, I now tran&s;mit you a particular Account of the Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s, and Con&s;equences of the late <HI>Land Bank</HI> or Manufactory Scheme from the fir&s;t Projection of it to this Time; and al&s;o of another memorable one call'd the <HI>Silver Scheme,</HI> &s;o far as it is connected with the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Scheme, that you may furni&s;h your&s;elf from thence with the Knowledge of all &s;uch Facts, as are nece&s;&s;ary to be known by you, in order to &s;tate all the Tran&s;actions and Proceed|ings

of this Government upon the&s;e Schemes both under the late and pre&s;ent Ad&mdash;n in their true Light,</P>
<P>But before I proceed to give you a Detail of them, I mu&s;t take the Liberty upon this Occa&s;ion to &s;ay, <HI>Sir,</HI> that I think the Conjunction of the Parties engaged in this Combination is a very extraordinary one: A Gentleman, who had not long ago the Honour to be his Maje&s;ty's G&mdash;r of this Pro|vince, is in League with One, who is commonly reputed, ever &s;ince the Act of Parliament for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Land Bank Scheme took Effect, to have made a Trade and Bu|&s;ine&s;s of buying up the late Land Bank Company's Bills in Order to make Demands upon the late Directors and Partners of it, for the Sake of private Gain, and to lay &s;uch of 'em under Contributions to him, as could be brought to pay him any Sum, in order to &s;creen them|&s;elves from Actions commenced, or threaten'd to be com|menced by him again&s;t them, and &s;candalou&s;ly pro&s;titu|ting the Act of Parliament de&s;igned for the Relief, and Benefit of &s;uch Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors only of the Bills, as had unwarily taken them in the common Cour&s;e of their Traffick and Dealings, and for the Suppre&s;&s;ion of the Scheme, to the ba&s;e Purpo&s;es of his own Avarice and Revenge, and mak|ing a mere Stale of the Act for his vile Practices: I &s;ay, his late Ex&mdash;cy takes into his Cabal <HI>&s;uch</HI> an A&s;&s;ociate to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his Attempt to defeat the Mea&s;ures of this Government for extricating the Country from the Mi&s;chiefs of this Scheme; which together with the <HI>Silver Scheme</HI> were the produce of his own Ad&mdash;n, the latter of them having grown up under his &s;pecial Grace and Favour, and the former by his Permi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;I now proceed to the Account of the two Schemes.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> of this Town, late Trea&s;urer of the <HI>Land Bank Company,</HI> was the original Projector of the <HI>Land Bank Scheme;</HI> and it appears by two of his Letters on that Subject to the late G&mdash;r <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r,</HI> one dated <HI>April</HI> 11th 1737, and the other <HI>January</HI> 14th 1740, (Copies of both which Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> has been induced to expo&s;e upon the Occa&s;ions
<PB N="4" REF="005325_0005_1016FE5D1C7877A8">
herein mentioned) that he had commu|nicated his Scheme to his late Ex&mdash;cy three Years before the <HI>Land Bank Company</HI> was formed, in order to take his Sentiments upon it; and had &s;everal Times di&s;cours'd with him upon that Subject both before and after that Time;&mdash;and that he began to procure Sub&s;criptions to his Scheme in 1737, of which he apprized the G&mdash;r in his fir&s;t mentioned Letter, by telling him, <HI>"That he was called upon every Day by Men of good E&s;tates in Trade to bring the Thing</HI> (the Scheme) <HI>forward, and that he could have a Hun|dred Sub&s;cribers in a Week's Time, and had then met &s;ome Gentlemen upon it; but had waited till his</HI> [Ex&mdash;cy's] <HI>Return from</HI> Pi&s;cataqua, <HI>that he might &s;ee him before he pro|ceeded &s;o far, but he then purpo&s;ed to go on with the Scheme, and hoped for Succe&s;s in it.</HI></P>
<P>Before I quit this Letter of Mr. <HI>Colman'</HI>s, I mu&s;t inform you, that it appears by it, that the late G&mdash;r had ob|jected again&s;t his Scheme, that the Bills were not to be redeemable by Silver&mdash;To obviate which, and another Objection, and to &s;hew the Expediency of the Scheme, Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> argues with his Ex&mdash;cy through his whole Letter; and to induce him to Countenance the Scheme, a&s;&s;ures him, among&s;t other Things, <HI>that he had his Ex</HI>&mdash;<HI>cy's private Intere&s;t in View in it;</HI> telling him, <HI>that the Lands, his Ex</HI>&mdash;<HI>cy was endeavouring to &s;ell We&s;tward</HI> (in order to pay off a Debt due, from him to the E&s;tate of the late Mr. <HI>Lloyd</HI> of London) <HI>as he was informed, would not then fetch ten Thou&s;and Pounds, which wou'd in a little Time fetch more than twenty Thou&s;and Pounds;</HI> and then proceeds in the following Words, <HI>Would it not then be much more for your Intere&s;t to take ten Thou&s;and Pounds out of this Bank, which would not co&s;t you above three per Cent,</HI> (the Terms upon which the other Sub&s;cribers to the Scheme were to have <HI>their</HI> Shares of the Bills) <HI>and to keep your Lands? And if the G</HI>&mdash;<HI>r does not think proper to appear him&s;elf in &s;uch an Affair, he does not want Friends, who will manage it for him, with as much Secre&s;y as he can de&s;ire</HI>&mdash;And he afterwards adds, <HI>that he could not expect his Ex</HI>&mdash;<HI>cy would appear openly</HI> for it (the Scheme) <HI>which he</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="005325_0006_1016FE5EE701F258">
<HI>wi&s;hed he could, becau&s;e he knew it would be very plea&s;ing to the People.</HI>&mdash;I have mention'd this Part of the Contents of that Letter &s;o particularly, that you may the better judge between Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r,</HI> and the late Trea&s;urer and Directors of the <HI>Land Bank Company</HI> concerning the Trea&s;urer's Propo&s;al in it to Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r</HI> to take <HI>l,</HI>10,000 of the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Bills at the before mention'd Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon the Foundation of this Propo&s;al, when it was ap|parent that the Land Bank Scheme would be de&s;troyed, and Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r</HI> became &s;u&s;pected of having favoured it in it's fir&s;t Ri&s;e; he then, <HI>and not before</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> and the late Directors &s;ay) declared in his own Vindication, that the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Company had offered to give him <HI>l.</HI> 10,000 in Bills of Credit of the old Tenor; nay, that he might have had <HI>l.</HI>20,000 old Tenor from them to favour their Scheme, and that he refu&s;ed it: This A&s;&s;ertion Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> and the late Directors in&s;i&s;t is groundle&s;s, and look on it as an A&s;per&s;ion upon them: They &s;ay, that this Propo&s;al or rather Que&s;tion of Mr. <HI>Colman'</HI>s to the late G&mdash;r, upon which he grounds his A&s;&s;ertion, was made to him above three Years before the Company was formed, and before the Per&s;ons, who were afterwards cho&s;en Directors of it, had entertained Thoughts of their being intere&s;ted in the Scheme; that it was made by Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> without the Privity of any other Per&s;on what&s;oever; that neither that or any other Propo&s;al or Offer of any Kind, was ever renew'd or made afterwards to his late Ex&mdash;cy, or any other Per&s;on either directly or indirectly by Mr. <HI>Colman,</HI> or the Directors, or Partners of the &s;aid late Com|pany, or any of them, or by any other Per&s;on on Account of the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> and Company, or any of them to induce his late Ex&mdash;cy to favour or connive at their Scheme, except that &s;ome of them had heard that Mr. <HI>C</HI>&mdash;<HI>r J</HI>&mdash;<HI>L</HI>&mdash;<HI>n</HI> of this Pro|vince, a Per&s;on publickly known not to be of found Mind and Memory, had taken Occa&s;ion, without the Con&s;ent or Privity of any of them, to make &s;ome Offer or Propo&s;al to his late Ex&mdash;cy of Advantages, that might be reap'd by him from the &s;aid late Company; but what the particu|lar
<PB N="6" REF="005325_0007_1016FE6319E9CDE8">
Propo&s;al or Offer might be, none of them were ever informed; and if any &s;uch was made, whatever it was, his Ex&mdash;cy had no ju&s;t Rea&s;on to give the lea&s;t Credit to it; and that the &s;aid <HI>C</HI>&mdash;<HI>J</HI>&mdash;<HI>L</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> tho' he was a Sub&s;criber to the Scheme, never was a Partner or any Ways intere&s;ted in it; and this Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> and all the late Directors, except one Gentleman, who has been for the&s;e la&s;t two Years in London, and for that Rea&s;on could not join in the Depo&s;ition, have lately in their Ju&s;tification declared upon Oath.&mdash;And the&s;e Gentlemen farther in&s;i&s;t that had the Propo&s;al mention'd in Mr. <HI>Colman'</HI>s Letter been really made to his late Ex&mdash;cy by the whole Com|pany, it is evidently no more than that he &s;hould take <HI>l.</HI>10,000 in <HI>Land Bank</HI> Bills in a private Manner, but upon paying the &s;ame Intere&s;t for it, that other Partners of the Scheme were to pay for <HI>their</HI> Shares of the Bills; that his Ex&mdash;cy well knew that he could not pay off a Sterling Debt in <HI>London</HI> by the Help of tho&s;e Bills, nor indeed could they have been of Service to him in any other Re&s;pect, as it was impracticable for any <HI>one</HI> Per&s;on to have found Vent for a fifth Part of <HI>l.</HI>10,000 in tho&s;e Bills, e&s;pecially in a private Manner, as his Ex&mdash;cy mu&s;t have done, had he accepted them.&mdash;Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r</HI> on the other Hand is &s;o fond of this boa&s;ted refu&s;al of <HI>l.</HI>10,000 old Tenor, as he calls it, and Mr. <HI>Colman'</HI>s Letter, upon which he founds his A&s;&s;ertion, that he has &s;everal Times declared (as I have been informed) that he would not take <HI>ten Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> for the Letter.&mdash;Upon the whole, I &s;hall leave you to judge for your &s;elf upon Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r'</HI>s Con&s;truction of the Terms of this Propo&s;al, and whether it can be deemed the Propo&s;al of the Company to him; and proceed to inform you, that &s;oon after the &s;ending of this Letter to his Ex&mdash;cy Mr <HI>Colman</HI> began to take in Sub&s;criptions to his Scheme, in order to form a Company or Partner|&s;hip upon it, as he had apprized the G&mdash;r he would, and proceeded in it without any Check or Interruption for above two Years, and 'till he had procured 395 Sub&s;cribers.&mdash;And in 1739 the <HI>Silver Scheme</HI> which was at fir&s;t reputed to be the Project of Col. <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> of this Place, and
<PB N="7" REF="005325_0008_1016FE65F2DBAB28">
called by his Name, began to be formed.&mdash;This Scheme plainly appears to have taken it's Ri&s;e from the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Scheme, and indeed to have been formed upon near the &s;ame Plan, but in &s;everal Re&s;pects con&s;iderably corrected and amended, and by the 25th of <HI>March</HI> 1740 had got 106 Sub&s;cribers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Land Bank</HI> Scheme, as it was finally &s;ettled, was a Scheme for the Emi&s;&s;ion of <HI>l.</HI>150,000 in Notes of Hand on Land Security to be receiv'd in Trade, and for all Debts by the Partners as equal to lawful Money, and at the Expiration of twenty Years to be redeemed by &s;everal Commodities therein enumerated, but not at any fixed Price: and in the mean Time <HI>l.</HI>10,000 of that Sum was to be employed in Trade as the Company's Stock to be exchang'd for their Notes, as the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them &s;hould want and demand any of the Commodities in their Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>And the Tenor of the Notes, which were to be &s;igned by the Directors, and endors'd <HI>Jo&s;eph Marion,</HI> was as follows, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><HI>We jointly and &s;everally Promi&s;e for our Selves and Partners to take this Bill as lawful Money at</HI> &s;ix Shillings and eight Pence <HI>per Ounce in all Payments, Trade and Bu|&s;ine&s;s, and for Stock in our Trea&s;ury at any Time; and after twenty Years to pay the &s;ame at that E&s;timate on Demand to Mr.</HI> Jo&s;eph Marion <HI>or Order in the Produce or Manufactures enumerated in our Scheme, for Value received.</HI></P>
<P>The Silver Scheme was for the Emi&s;&s;ion of <HI>l.</HI>120,000 in Notes redeemable by Silver Money at 20<HI>s</HI> per Ounce in fifteen Years, and by Gold Coin <HI>pro rat&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P>And by the 19th Article of this Scheme <HI>the Partners of it agreed and promis'd that they would receive in Trade, and for Debts due (Specialties and expre&s;s Contracts excepted) the Bills emitted on the Scheme at the following Rates, in the &s;everal Terms, and Periods therein after mentioned,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>for</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="005325_0009_1016FE68E7DA31B8">
<HI>the fir&s;t year after their Emi&s;&s;ion at the Rate of twenty eight Shillings and four Pence for an Ounce of Silver, for the &s;e|cond Year after their Emi&s;&s;ion, at the Rate of twenty &s;even Shillings and nine Pence; for the third Year at the Rate of twenty &s;even Shillings and two Pence,</HI> and &s;o on in the like Proportion le&s;&s;ening the Price of Silver to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the Bills &s;even Pence per Ounce in each Year, 'till by the 15th Year it was reduced to twenty Shillings per Ounce&mdash;<HI>and that the Directors of the Company &s;hould be and were thereby accordingly obliged to exchange and give in the common current Bills to every Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the Notes on Demand &s;o much as would purcha&s;e one Ounce of Silver for twenty eight Shillings and four Pence in tho&s;e Notes for the fir&s;t Year after their coming out, and &s;o much as would purcha&s;e one Ounce of Silver for twenty &s;even Shillings and nine Pence for the &s;econd Year, and in the &s;ame Manner during the whole fifteen Years.</HI>&mdash;And by the Tenor of the Notes of this Scheme, which were &s;ign'd by the Directors and indors'd <HI>I&s;aac Win&s;low,</HI> the Directors, <HI>jointly and &s;everally Pro|mi&s;e to pay to</HI> I&s;aac Win&s;low <HI>Merchant or Order in</HI> Bo&s;ton&mdash;<HI>Ounces of Silver Sterling Alloy, or&mdash;Standard Gold, both coin'd and Troy Weight by the</HI> 31<HI>&s;t of</HI> December 1755. <HI>Value receiv'd,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;And upon the Back of the Notes it was advertis'd thus; <Q>All the Sub&s;cribers to this Scheme promi&s;e and oblige them&s;elves to take this Bill at the Rates undermentioned in all Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s

<P>Upon comparing the two Schemes and Companies together the&s;e Ob&s;ervations &s;eem to be very obvious, 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> That the Sum in Notes of Hand propo&s;ed to be emitted by the Land Bank Company, being <HI>l.</HI> 150,000
<PB N="9" REF="005325_0010_1016FE6D1A224AD8">
to pa&s;s as lawful Money (that is) equal to <HI>l.</HI>600,000 in Bills of Credit of the old Tenor, was in it &s;elf, exclu&s;ive of the badne&s;s of the Scheme in other Re&s;pects, &s;uch an im|moderate Sum, as mu&s;t not only have va&s;tly depreciated the Company's Bills, but all the other Bills current within the Province, and con&s;equently have been extremely mi&s;|chievous to the Community; whereas the Sum propo&s;ed to be emitted by the Partners of the Silver Scheme was but one fifth Part of the intended Land Bank Sum.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> That the Land Bank Bills were not redeemable 'till the End of twenty Years, and then at no certain Value; the enumerated Commodities, in one or other of which they were made redeemable, being uncertain as to the Prices to be &s;et upon them by the Company, and as to the Species of them, in which each Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or might exchange his Bills; and in the mean Time the Bills were not &s;ecured in the lea&s;t from depreciating below their nominal Value; whereas the Bills of the Silver Scheme were redeemable with Silver or Gold at a certain Value at the End of <HI>fifteen</HI> Years, and were propos'd by the 19th Article of it to be &s;e|cur'd again&s;t depreciating below their nominal Value in the mean Time by being made exchangeable for &s;uch Quantities of the common current Bills, as would purcha&s;e the Silver pro|mis'd by the Bill in each of the fifteen Years at the Rates mentioned in the Scheme.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly.</HI> The Directors and Partners of the Land Bank Com|pany, a very few of them only excepted, were Per&s;ons of but mean Circum&s;tances, whereas the Partners of the Sil|ver Scheme were many of them Per&s;ons of good E&s;tates; and the Directors in particular were &s;ome of them princi|pal Merchants in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and of the be&s;t Credit and mo&s;t con&s;iderable E&s;tates in the Province, and the Company was undoubtedly capable of executing their Scheme, &s;o that it was no Impo&s;ition upon the World in that Re&s;pect.</P>

<P>In the &s;ame Month and Beginning of <HI>January</HI> other Votes of the Council were pa&s;s'd for removing other Ju&s;tices of the Peace from their Po&s;ts for continuing to be concerned in or encouraging the pa&s;&s;ing of the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Bills: But nothing was done by his Ex&mdash;cy for the actual Removal of any of the&s;e Officers in Con&s;equence of the Votes of Council, except nominating and commi&s;&s;ionating <HI>Job Almy,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to be a Ju&s;tice of the Pleas for the County of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> in the Room of the above mention'd Mr. <HI>Leonard,</HI> who&s;e Commi&s;&s;ion for that Office was thereby &s;uper&s;eded: as to the before-mention'd Ju&s;tices of the Peace and the other Ju&s;tices, again&s;t whom like Votes of the Council were pa&s;s'd, which Officers are all con&s;tituted by the G&mdash;r, in whom <HI>&s;olely</HI> is the Power of nomina|ting &amp; commi&s;&s;ionating 'em for their re&s;pective Po&s;ts, tho' the Advice and Con&s;ent of the Council is requi&s;ite to make &s;uch Nominations effectual, his Ex&mdash;cy neither i&s;&s;ued out new general Commi&s;&s;ions of the Peace, nor &s;ent them particular <HI>&s;uper&s;edeas's,</HI> (one or other of which Acts was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the Removal of them from their Po&s;ts,) nor even &s;ent <HI>his own</HI> Orders (pur&s;uant to the Vote of the Council) to the Clerks of the Peace to &s;trike their Names out of the Li&s;ts of Rolls of Ju&s;tices in their re&s;pective Counties, nor did any Act what&s;oever, whereby he could po&s;&s;ibly imagine that he had &s;uper&s;eded any of their Commi&s;&s;ions, not even &s;o much as &s;igning his Con&s;ent to the Council's Votes of Di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion, which according to his Cu&s;tom of &s;igning his Con|&s;ent to Votes for rai&s;ing a Committee of both Hou&s;es to con&s;ider of any Matters in order to make their Report upon 'em to the two Hou&s;es, &s;eem'd natural for him to

<P>It is difficult to know what to impute his Ex&mdash;cy's Behaviour to in this Ca&s;e: it &s;eems incredible that after i&s;&s;u|ing two Proclamations for prohibiting all Civil, and Mili|tary Officers to countenance the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Scheme under the Penalty of being di&s;mi&s;s'd from their Po&s;ts, and his actually removing Mr. <HI>Leonard</HI> from being a Ju&s;tice of the Inferiour Court of Common Pleas for the County of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing &s;ome Military Officers for that Offence his Ex&mdash;cy &s;hould not really be in earne&s;t to remove the Ju&s;tices of the Peace and Coroners, but &s;hould promote tho&s;e Votes of Council <HI>(if he did promote 'em)</HI> to &s;ave Appea|rances only; and it &s;eems equally incredible that his Ex&mdash;cy &s;hould be &s;o profoundly ignorant of the Principles of Go|vernment, as to imagine that the Council had Power by their Vote to remove Officers, who are nominated and com|mi&s;&s;ionated by His Maje&s;ty's G&mdash;r, and by the Tenor of their Commi&s;&s;ions hold their Po&s;ts during his Plea&s;ure; and that no Act of his was nece&s;&s;ary to that Purpo&s;e: I &s;hall therefore leave you to your own Judgment in this extraordinary Affair.</P>
<P>However that may be, if before the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Sub&s;cri|bers had form'd them&s;elves into a Company, and enter'd into mutual Agreements and Covenants, and had i&s;&s;ued out their Notes his Ex&mdash;cy had i&s;&s;ued his two la&s;t Proclamations, which it was indi&s;putably in his Power to have done in the Beginning of this Scheme, as the Council

<P>It is certain that had Mr. <HI>Pa</HI>&mdash;<HI>dge</HI> &s;ucceeded in his Attempt to prevent the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act of Parliament for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Scheme, he could not have

Ex&mdash;cy had done his Duty with Re&s;pect to the Di|rectors and Partners of the <HI>Silver Scheme,</HI> whom the Parlia|ment of <HI>Great Britain</HI> afterwards condemned equally with the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Company, and &s;ubjected to the &s;ame Penal|ties that it inflicted upon the Partners of the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Scheme, the People would have acquie&s;ced in the Suppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Scheme, or at lea&s;t have born it with &s;e|cret Reluctance only; whereas their Clamour and Threat|nings now grew &s;o loud that they alarm'd the Government; and a Vote of Council was thereupon pa&s;s'd the 9th of <HI>May</HI> reciting, that <Q>Information had been given of a Combi|nation of many ill minded Per&s;ons in &s;everal Towns with|in the Province to come in a tumultuous and &s;editious Manner into the Town of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in order to force the Currency of the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Bills; and thereupon ordering that the Members of the Board then pre&s;ent, who were Ju&s;tices of the Peace throughout the Province, &s;hould i&s;&s;ue out their Warrants for apprehending the Per&s;ons or &s;ome of the Principal of them, that were repre&s;ented as concerned in that De&s;ign.</Q></P>

<P>In the mean Time Advice arrived that Mr. <HI>S</HI>&mdash;<HI>ey</HI> was appointed G&mdash;r of the Province by his Maje&s;ty; but as his Commi&s;&s;ion was not arrived here by the 8th of <HI>July</HI> G&mdash;r <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r</HI> then met the new A&s;&s;embly; when it ap|peared that the Di&s;&s;olution of the late A&s;&s;embly had wro't no Change in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, but rather in|crea&s;ed it's Number of <HI>Land Bank</HI> Members.&mdash;The Hou&s;e then proceeded to elect for their Speaker <HI>John Choate,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a Director of that Company, whom G&mdash;r <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r</HI> there|fore negativ'd; after which they proceeded to a new Choice and elected <HI>John Hob&s;on,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a Favourer of the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Scheme but not intere&s;ted in it, whom the G&mdash;r approv'd of.</P>

Obedience to the Act of Parliament for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it, but whil&s;t on the other Hand their Party continued to &s;et the Act at Defiance, and threaten their Oppo&s;ers, &s;uddenly al|ter'd his Behaviour towards the&s;e Directors, and approv'd of the Choice of <HI>them</HI> and other noted Abettors of the Scheme to be Collectors of the Exci&s;e, and accordingly commi&s;&s;ionated them for that Purpo&s;e.&mdash;This Alteration of his Ex&mdash;cy's late Conduct towards the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Company &s;eems very remarkable; But to what it is to be imputed, whether to the near Approach of his being re|moved from his G&mdash;t on the Arrival of G&mdash;r <HI>S</HI>&mdash;<HI>ey</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion, or any other Cau&s;e, I &s;hall not pre|tend to determine: It is certain that had not his E&mdash;cy been very well inclined to have done it, and even fond of this farewell Act of Grace to the Company, he might have delay'd acting upon the Li&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Land Bank</HI> Collectors of Exci&s;e, and have left it for his Suc&mdash;r, who&s;e Commi&s;&s;ion was every Day expected, either to have <HI>approved</HI> or <HI>di&s;|approved</HI> of them.</P>
<P>On the 13th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the pre&s;ent G&mdash;r's Commi&s;&s;ion arrived and was publi&s;h'd the Day following, which put an End to G&mdash;r <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r</HI>'s Ad&mdash;n: The State and Condition of the Province at the Time of Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r</HI>'s quitting the C&mdash;r may be collected in general from the Sen&s;e, which it appears the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives had of it by their Addre&s;s to Mr. <HI>S</HI>&mdash;<HI>ey</HI> upon his Acce&s;&s;ion to the G&mdash;t: They there tell him that <Q>they were much concerned to think that it &s;hould be at a Time when this Province was labouring under &s;o many Difficulties &amp; Di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, and to which he could be no Stranger; but then it would be &s;o much the more for his Honour, if he might be the happy In&s;trument of leading 'em out of them; <HI>and that they mu&s;t not de&s;pair of the Common Wealth.</HI></Q>&mdash;As to the Temper of the People at that Time, the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Party, which was very numerous throughout the Province, were irritated and inflamed to &s;uch a Degree, that they &s;eemed ripe for Tumult and Di&s;order; they had
<PB N="42" REF="005325_0043_1016FED040BF0E28">
per&s;waded them&s;elves that the Act of Parliament could not be carried into Execution, and had even bid Defiance to the Government by their Threats; and it had not a little contributed to exa&s;perate them, that tho' the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> had included the Directors &amp; Partners of the <HI>Silver</HI> Scheme in the &s;ame Condemnation with tho&s;e of the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Scheme, yet the former had &s;hared the Smiles and Favours of his late Ex&mdash;cy, whil&s;t tho&s;e of the <HI>Land Bank</HI> had been treated of late in a quite different Man|ner: Nor was the Temper of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives in a much better Frame than that of the Populace, two Thirds of the Members at lea&s;t being either Partners of Abettors of the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Scheme, from whom a general Oppo&s;ition to all the Mea&s;ures of Government nece&s;&s;ary at that Time for his Maje&s;ty's Service and the publick Welfare of the Province &s;eemed in their pre&s;ent Di&s;po&s;ition to be much feared: As to the G&mdash;r's di&s;&s;olving 'em and calling a new A&s;&s;embly, the Di&s;&s;olution of the late A&s;&s;embly had given him full Proof that it would only &s;erve to inflame the Country more; and that it was in vain to expect that a new Choice would le&s;&s;en the Number of <HI>Land Bank</HI> Repre|&s;entatives.</P>
<P>Several Points of Con&s;equence to his Maje&s;ty's Service were at this Time nece&s;&s;ary to be effected by the pre&s;ent G&mdash;r, among which were the&s;e following, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>In <HI>September</HI> 1741, Capt. <HI>Win&s;low</HI> arriv'd here from the Army under General <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Command with In&s;tructions to rai&s;e Recruits for the <HI>American</HI> Regiment then in his Ma|je&s;ty's Service in the Expedition again&s;t the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Settlements in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> which it was the G&mdash;r's Duty to promote in the Province, pur&s;uant to his Maje&s;ty's expre&s;s Orders for that Purpo&s;e, by engaging the A&s;&s;embly to give &s;uitable Encouragement to Men to enli&s;t in the Service: In the Beginning of the <HI>September</HI> preceeding G&mdash;r <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r</HI> had indulg'd the la&s;t A&s;&s;embly with di&s;banding at their Reque&s;t four Companies of Soldiers then lately rai&s;ed in the Province for his Maje&s;ty's afore&s;aid Service in Pur&s;u|ance of his Royal Commands, and for the tran&s;porting of

which to the Place of general Rendezvous in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> that A&s;&s;embly had obliged them&s;elves by a late Vote to rai&s;e a &s;ufficient Sum of Money; by Means of which Di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion, which his Ex&mdash;cy went into the Field to effect per&s;onally at the Head of each Company, three of tho&s;e Companies were entirely broke up &amp; lo&s;t from his Maje&s;ty's Service, and the other was very near being lo&s;t, but was at la&s;t with great Difficulty &s;aved by the Advice and Vigilance of his pre&s;ent Ex&mdash;cy then a private Gentleman upon their re-inli&s;ting, which by the Terms of their Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion they had a Liberty of doing.&mdash;The Pretence of his late Ex&mdash;y's a&s;&s;uming this extraordinary Power was that Commi&s;&s;ions, Cloaths and Arms were not &s;ent for tho&s;e Companies to <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> whereas undoubted A&s;&s;urances had been given that tho&s;e Companies would have been re|ceived in the Army upon the &s;ame Terms with the Companies, for who&s;e Officers Commi&s;&s;ions had been &s;ent to <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> and upon the A&s;&s;urance of which the Officers of tho&s;e four Companies had been prevail'd on by his pre&s;ent Ex&mdash;cy to keep their Companies together (till G&mdash;r <HI>B</HI>&mdash;<HI>r</HI> di&s;mi&s;s'd 'em) in order to proceed with them to the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> without receiving their Commi&s;&s;ions, Arms, or Cloaths from his Maje&s;ty at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and would have accordingly proceeded, had not he thus broke the Companies up, but in&s;i&s;t|ed, as it was plainly his Duty to have done, that they &s;hould have been tran&s;ported to the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> at the Province's Expence, pur&s;uant to the former Vote of the A&s;&s;embly; which unprecedented Compliance of the late G&mdash;r and Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of Soldiers actually enli&s;ted in His Maje&s;ty's Service had an Appearance and Tendency to make the pre&s;ent G&mdash;r's Demands of an Encouragement for rai&s;ing Recruits di&s;agreable to the A&s;&s;embly, and his Succe&s;s doubtful.</P>
<P>The late G&mdash;r had al&s;o giv'n Encouragement to the De&s;truction of His Maje&s;ty's Woods by countenancing Per&s;ons commonly reputed to be De&s;troyers of them in a frivolous and groundle&s;s Petition containing Complaints again&s;t His Maje&s;ty's then Survey or General of the Woods, and the Court of Vice Admiralty addre&s;&s;ed to him&s;elf with

<P>The late G&mdash;r had al&s;o throughout his whole Ad|mini&s;tration indulged the A&s;&s;embly in the Practice of di|viding old Town&s;hips and erecting new ones out of 'em whereby tho&s;e Towns had a Right to double the Number of their Repre&s;entatives; which Practice (tho' an e&s;tabli&s;h'd one with the A&s;&s;embly) as the pre&s;ent G&mdash;r look'd upon it to be of pernicious Con&s;equence in &s;everal Re&s;pects, he was determin'd to put a &s;top to.</P>

<P><PB N="45" REF="005325_0046_1016FED65C704218">
Other Points al&s;o e&s;&s;ential for the Good of the Country demanded his pre&s;ent Ex&mdash;cy's immediate Attention: The late G&mdash;r had indulged the People with a Scheme of Province Bills, which from the Experience of many Years before <HI>his</HI> coming to the Ad&mdash;n had been found by their continual depreciating to prove a mere Fraud to the Merchants of <HI>Great Britain</HI> trading hither, and other Creditors in general; and which his pre&s;ent Ex&mdash;cy had therefore determined to bring under a new Regulation.</P>
<P>His late Ex&mdash;cy had likewi&s;e permitted upwards of <HI>l.</HI> 390,000 of the&s;e Bills, computed in Bills of the old Tenor, to be out&s;tanding beyond their &s;tated Periods, which both the Province Law had provided and his Maje&s;ty's Royal In&s;tructions required &s;hould have been &s;unk at their proper Periods; and this great Arrear it was nece&s;&s;ary for the pre|&s;ent G&mdash;r to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to be drawn in by Executions at a Time, when the publick Service happen'd to require hea|vier Taxes to be lay'd on the People than what they had pay'd for twenty Years before; the drawing in of which Sum mu&s;t be felt by the Towns in Arrear as much as if it had been a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon them by a new Tax.</P>
<P>For effecting &s;ome of the&s;e Points, the Concurrence of the A&s;&s;embly with the G&mdash;r was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and for compa&s;&s;ing the others it was requi&s;ite that the Di&s;|&s;atisfaction and Ferment, in which his late Ex&mdash;cy had left much the greate&s;t Part of the Country, when he quitted the C&mdash;r, &s;hould be allay'd.&mdash;The only practicable Method therefore for the G&mdash;r to enable him&s;elf to do the Duty of his Po&s;t in the&s;e Particulars was to re&s;tore the general Tranquility of the Province, and an Harmony between the three Branches of the Legi&s;lature, the latter of which he could not rea&s;onably hope to effect without reclaiming the leading Men of the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Party in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives into the Service of his Maje&s;ty, and the true Intere&s;t of the Country; whereby all unrea&s;onable Op|po&s;ition in that Hou&s;e to the Mea&s;ures of the G&mdash;t might be removed; and the previous Step to be taken as
<PB N="46" REF="005325_0047_1016FED7F47A6320">
preparatory to this End and all other Mea&s;ures, was to di&s;|po&s;e the principal Directors and Partners of the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Company voluntarily to pay a due Obedience to the Act of Parliament for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing their Scheme: 'Till this was effected it was in vain to expect that the publick Tranqui|lity could be &s;ettled, or the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives bro't to a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of their Duty; or that even the Act of Par|liament it&s;elf could be carried into Execution without Dan|ger of &s;ome violent Struggles and Commotions in the Pro|vince.&mdash;This therefore claimed the pre&s;ent G&mdash;r's mo&s;t immediate Attention; and &s;uch Progre&s;s was made in this Affair by the 23d of <HI>September</HI> that at a general Meeting on that Day of the Directors and Partners of the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Scheme held at <HI>Milton</HI> <Q>a Committee was cho&s;en who were impower'd to attend and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Di|rectors in con&s;uming the Bills as paid in by the Partners, or otherwi&s;e drawn into the Trea&s;ury, and that they in Behalf of the Partners &s;hould audit &amp; &s;ettle the Accounts of Trade with the Directors or Factors of the Partners, in order to their receiving or paying what might be gain'd or lo&s;t on the Trade, to be concluded and &s;hut up as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and that they &s;hould &s;ee the Plates on which the Bills were &s;truck be forthwith de&s;troyed.</Q>;&mdash;And on the 28th of <HI>September</HI> the Directors by an Entry under their Hands in the Company's Books made the following Declaration, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <Q>We the Sub&s;cribers having been con|cerned in the <HI>Manufactory</HI> Scheme lately erected in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> on Land Security, which by the Partners is voted to be di&s;&s;olved, do hereby publickly declare that from this Time forward we do de&s;i&s;t from, give up, and relinqui&s;h, and wholly forbear to act farther therein, or directly or indirectly to carry on the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P>The above mention'd Vote of the <HI>Land Bank</HI> Company for putting an End to their Scheme was difficultly obtained, and carried only by a bare Majority, many of the Partners being warmly of Opinion to &s;tand out in Defiance of the Act of Parliament; but the Con&s;equence of that Vote, and of the Declaration of the Directors for renouncing the Scheme
<PB N="47" REF="005325_0048_1016FEDD73B797F0">
