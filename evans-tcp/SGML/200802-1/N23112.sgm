<Q>BUT NONE OF THESE THINGS MOVE ME, NEITHER COUNT I MY LIFE DEAR UNTO MYSELF, SO THAT I MIGHT FINISH MY COURSE WITH JOY, AND THE MINISTRY WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED OF THE LORD JESUS.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE are the words of the great apo&s;tle Paul. He addre&s;&s;ed them to the elders of the church of Ephe|&s;us. The&s;e elders endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from going to Jeru&s;alem, as they imagined he would there be expo&s;ed to great troubles and dangers, from the enemies of the go&s;pel. The apo&s;tle con&s;idered it his duty to go. He was very de&s;irous of preaching chri&s;tianity to his countrymen, the Jews, who dwelt at Jeru&s;alem. He was determined not to be prevented, by the formidable pic|ture of impending dangers, &s;et before him. He expect|ed troubles, and was prepared to meet and bear them, with fortitude, and patience. "None of the&s;e things move me."</P>
<P>HE expre&s;&s;es a firm and un&s;haken re&s;olution, to pur|&s;ue the path of duty, di&s;covered to him, notwith&s;tand|ing the difficulties and hazards which might attend it. He had engaged in a good cau&s;e, in a good work, and
<PB N="6" REF="030548_0004_0FE7A77E96BF798F8">
he would not de&s;ert it, becau&s;e the duties of it could not be performed, but with great danger and &s;elf-denial. In this he &s;et a noble example, to the followers of CHRIST, in general, and to his mini&s;ters in particular. "Hav|ing put their hand to the plough they &s;hould not look back." They &s;hould not neglect any known duty, what|ever may be the expence or pain of performing it.</P>
<P>IN the following words of our text he ri&s;es, in the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of a holy zeal and heroick courage. "Neither count I my life dear to me, that I might fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy, and the mini&s;try which I have re|ceived of the LORD JESUS." He had "received the mini&s;try" of the go&s;pel, or an apo&s;tle&s;hip, "of the LORD JESUS," who is the great LORD of the harve&s;t, who&s;e &s;overeign province it is to &s;end labourers into his vineyard. This apo&s;tle had a clear, a &s;pecial, an extra|ordinary call to this work. The call he had accepted; and to the &s;ervice he had devoted his life. Therefore to <HI>wear it out,</HI> or even to <HI>lay it down,</HI> in that &s;acred em|ployment, was not &s;o painful to his mind and appre|hen&s;ion, as the thought of quitting the work or doing the duties of it &s;lightly. He had &s;et out in the chri&s;t|ian <HI>cour&s;e;</HI> he had engaged in the chri&s;tian <HI>mini&s;try.</HI> To fini&s;h the&s;e well was his great object. This &s;o &s;trongly engaged his attention and pur&s;uit, as to give him a noble elevation of &s;oul, above the ob&s;tructions and di&s;courage|ments which might lie in the way. He expected his life would be &s;pent, and perhaps &s;hortned by a diligent and faithful performance of his duty as a chri&s;tian, and e&s;pecially as a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter. He laid his account in this, and the event proved his calculation ju&s;t.</P>
<P>PAUL went to Jeru&s;alem. After he had preached the go&s;pel there, for a &s;ea&s;on, and with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, the Jews, in a tumultuous manner &s;eized him, and brought him before their eccle&s;ia&s;tical court. They accu&s;ed him of &s;ubverting their &s;y&s;tem of religion, and of teaching things contrary to the law of Mo&s;es. He made a clear, rational, and animated defence. But finding it did not

&s;atisfy the partial bigotted judges, before whom he was brought, he appealed to Cae&s;ar, the roman emperor. After a while, he was &s;ent to Rome, to take his trial there. His trial was long delayed. During the delay, he enjoyed &s;ome liberty. He improved it, in promot|ing a cau&s;e, which lay near to his heart, and was dearer to him than his life. He preached the go&s;pel, planted chri&s;tian churches, and wrote epi&s;tles. After a while he was confined a pri&s;oner at Rome. In pri&s;on he wrote &s;everal of tho&s;e invaluable epi&s;tles, which we have in the new-te&s;tament, and which con&s;titute part of the &s;acred canon. After he was liberated from this con|finement, which continued about two years, he travelled over great part of Italy, preaching the go&s;pel, and found|ing churches. He went to Spain, to Crete, to Philippi, to Macedonia; and at length, returned to Rome, about the year of the chri&s;tian aera 65. The &s;acred hi&s;tory doth not particularly inform us, what brought on his &s;econd impri&s;onment, at Rome, and his death. But &s;ome of the antient fathers, and particularly St. Chry&s;o|&s;tom, tell us, in their writings, that he having converted, by his mini&s;try, a cupbearer, and a concubine, of the emperor Nero, who was a bitter enemy, and cruel per|&s;ecutor, of chri&s;tianity, he was &s;o enraged, that he order|ed Paul to be &s;eized, and committed to pri&s;on: That from pri&s;on he was brought forth, and beheaded, at a place called the <HI>&s;alvian waters,</HI> on the 29th day of June, A. D. 66: That he was buried at <HI>O&s;tium;</HI> and that af|terwards, when the roman empire became chri&s;tian, a magnificent church was built over his tomb, which, Mr. Calmet, in his dictionary, &s;ays continue to this day. Thus this great apo&s;tle to the Gentiles, "fini&s;hed his cour&s;e, and the mini&s;try which he had received of the LORD JESUS," by the honors of martyrdom. No man, it is likely, ever did as much in &s;preading the go&s;pel, and promoting the cau&s;e of CHRIST, as he. That his &s;ufferings, in his cau&s;e were exceedingly great and pre&s;|&s;ing, we may collect, from the hi&s;tory of the acts of the apo&s;tles, and from &s;everal of his own letters, before he &s;ealed his te&s;timony to the truth and goodne&s;s of that cau&s;e, by his blood.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="030548_0006_0FE7C558F160F80">
BUT is this a ju&s;t picture of what the mini&s;ters of CHRIST'S religion are to expect, and of what they do in general &s;uffer? In an&s;wer to this enquiry, it may be &s;aid, that there hath been no &s;mall &s;imilarity between the &s;ervices and &s;ufferings of this eminent &s;ervant of CHRIST, and tho&s;e of many, who were his brethren and companions, "in the kingdom and patience of JESUS;" e&s;pecially in the early days of chri&s;tianity, when its pro|moters generally met with warm oppo&s;ition, and cruel per&s;ecution. The ca&s;e has been very different, at &s;ome periods, and in &s;ome countries &s;ince. This difference hath been &s;trikingly obvious, in our happy land, in which the principles of religious liberty have been &s;o well un|der&s;tood; and maintained; and in which, the faithful mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, in&s;tead of being per&s;ecuted, have been honoured, and encouraged, by men of the be&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters in civil &s;tations.</P>
<P>BUT can we hence pronounce, that labourers, in this part of CHRIST'S vineyard, have no trials and difficul|ties, connected with their profe&s;&s;ion and employment? This would, undoubtedly, be carrying the matter too far, and &s;aying what is univer&s;ally found by experience not to be true.</P>
<P>INDEED for one, in that profe&s;&s;ion, to exhibit a long and dark catalogue of the trials and troubles which at|tend it, might lead &s;ome to &s;u&s;pect, that he aimed to make a merit to him&s;elf, in the fortitude and patience with which he meets, and bears &s;uch trials and troubles. I wi&s;h not to fall under &s;uch an imputation, or &s;u&s;picion. Still I do not conceive it ami&s;s for one, in the profe&s;&s;ion, before mentioned, to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome of the burthens and difficulties which can hardly be &s;eparated from it. This may tend to excite a proper degree of candor and ten|derne&s;s, in his fellow chri&s;tians towards him, and to en|gage their prayers for him. "He who wears the &s;hoe, be&s;t knows where it is &s;trait and pinches," to u&s;e a common remark; or to u&s;e one of Solomon's, "the heart knoweth his own bitterne&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="030548_0007_0FE7C58F6F0D22B0">
No &s;mall part of the difficulty of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter's work and office, con&s;i&s;ts in properly "taking heed to him&s;elf." To maintain that &s;pirituality, that devout and pious frame of mind, and that &s;ober circum&s;pect cour&s;e of conduct, which the chri&s;tian character requires, and which is peculiarly requi&s;ite, to &s;upport and adorn the mini&s;terial, is no ea&s;y thing, even for a good man. Great watchfulne&s;s, &s;ervent prayer, and help from above, are nece&s;&s;ary to it. The mini&s;ters of religion are com|pared to "a city &s;et on a hill which cannot be hid." Many eyes are upon them. The&s;e are not always the eyes of candor and friend&s;hip, but too often of &s;u&s;pi|cion and malevolence. What mini&s;ter can be always &s;o circum&s;pect and cautious, as to avoid creating, though without intending it, a number of little piques and ene|mies, again&s;t him&s;elf? He may do it &s;ometimes, even by an inflexible di&s;charge of nece&s;&s;ary duties. And if his character mu&s;t be taken from tho&s;e whom he has thus innocently, perhaps laudably, offended, all his vir|tues will be thrown into the back ground, and his foibles magnified with the utmo&s;t virulence of malice, and re&s;entment.</P>
<P>No part of his profe&s;&s;ional bu&s;ine&s;s, which a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter has to perform, is without it's attendant trials and difficulties. He mu&s;t, through a great proportion of his time, apply him&s;elf to clo&s;e &s;tudy. "This is ea&s;y employment," &s;ome may be ready to pronounce; and tho&s;e would be mo&s;t likely to pronounce &s;uch an opinion, with confidence, who know lea&s;t of the matter. An ancient Sage, who knew what it is to apply his mind to a great variety of &s;ubjects, to acquire &s;cience, and in|ve&s;tigate truth, remarks, "that much &s;tudy is a weari|ne&s;s to the fle&s;h." Clo&s;e exertion of the mind preys rapidly on the body. It relaxes and weakens the various &s;prings of the animal machine. It impairs the powers of dige&s;tion; hence crudities abound, producing that very afflictive and variegated tribe of di&s;orders, called <HI>nervous,</HI> and <HI>hypochondriac,</HI> by which no cla&s;s of men &s;uffer &s;o much, as the &s;edentary and &s;tudious. They
<PB N="10" REF="030548_0008_0FE7C55ACDE23EB8">
often become &s;trangers to quiet repo&s;e, and refre&s;hing &s;leep. All the &s;prings of life are weakened, and the period of it frequently accelerated. Great &s;tudents &s;el|dom enjoy a healthful vigorous &s;tate of body, for any con&s;iderable &s;pace of time. Their lot is often an early old age, and premature death.</P>
<P>WILL it not require the vigorous employment of all the powers of the chri&s;tian pa&s;tor's mind, to &s;earch out the various truths and duties, contained in the &s;acred oracles? To &s;hew their harmony and connection? In weekly compo&s;itions, to a&s;tort and arrange them, in plain and familiar language; and in a manner adapted to the different ages, characters and circum&s;tances of his peo|ple? To endeavour, by a proper application of them, to awaken the thoughtle&s;s and &s;ecure; to lead the weary and heavy laden to re&s;t and &s;afety in CHRIST; to re|move from hypocrites their fal&s;e hopes and confidences, that they may build on the &s;ure corner &s;tone, laid in Zion; to comfort the meek and humble followers of Je&s;us, when their &s;pirits are depre&s;&s;ed, with gloomy apprehen&s;ions of their &s;tate and character; and to guide all into that way of &s;alvation, revealed in the go&s;pel? The per&s;on who &s;uppo&s;es &s;uch &s;ervices can be perform|ed, and &s;uch &s;tated in&s;tructions prepared, without much clo&s;e &s;tudy, and great application of mind, judges quite erroneou&s;ly. He mu&s;t have paid very little attention to the matter.</P>
<P>As to the labor of <HI>public &s;peaking,</HI> from &s;abbath to &s;abbath, and on other days of &s;ocial wor&s;hip, &s;ome may &s;uppo&s;e it light and incon&s;iderable. Do &s;uch judge rightly? Do they judge by experience? The experiment will &s;hew &s;uch an opinion to be unfounded, and mu&s;t have taught all who have made it, that to &s;tand for &s;eve|ral hours, and to &s;peak, with a voice loud and forcible enough to be heard, by a large a&s;&s;embly, require no &s;mall exertions of &s;trength; and that few things will &s;ooner &s;pend and exhau&s;t it. Not only the lungs, and other organs of &s;peech, are kept on the &s;train; but the
<PB N="11" REF="030548_0009_0FE7C5954A6116D8">
powers of the mind mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, be vigor|ou&s;ly exerci&s;ed. There mu&s;t be a con&s;tant concern to &s;peak clearly and properly. In mo&s;t a&s;&s;emblies the preacher has the additional trial, of &s;eeing &s;ome before him, who&s;e attention he is not able to gain, by his be&s;t endeavours, to prepare u&s;eful in&s;tructions, and to de|liver them with propriety; &s;ome who, either fall a&s;leep, or appear quite heedle&s;s and inattentive, "hearing as though they heard not;" others who, if they hear, it is not with the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition; it is rather with a view, to watch for faults, and to make uncandid remarks, than to be in&s;tructed, and excited to a faithful perform|ance of duty. A mere mi&s;take, in the &s;peaker, will, by &s;uch per&s;ons, be magnified into a crime; and any little impropriety, or uncouthne&s;s, in his accents, pro|nunciation, or ge&s;ture, will be more noticed, than the mo&s;t u&s;eful and important &s;entiments; will be remem|bred longer, and be mentioned oftner, either to cen&s;ure, or ridicule the performer. The pre&s;ent &s;peaker, how|ever liable he may be to &s;uch remarks, has the &s;atisfac|tion to think, there are as few, among his &s;tated hearers, di&s;po&s;ed to make them, as in mo&s;t a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>BUT there is another thing, which may be &s;till more likely to excite unfriendly feelings, in many per&s;ons towards their mini&s;ter, and con&s;equently be an exerci&s;e to his faith and patience. His office obliges him to be plain and faithful in his public addre&s;&s;es, to reprove the vicious, to warn them of their danger, to call them to repentance, to urge on them the performance of neg|lected duties, and to pre&s;s &s;uch a virtuous and godly conver&s;ation, as is contrary to a carnal heart, and a corrupt di&s;po&s;ition. Such exhortations and admoni|tions will generally be ungrateful to the more loo&s;e and vicious part of an audience. Will they not be apt to feel, towards their religious in&s;tructor, much as Ahab did towards the prophet Micajah, though they &s;hould not expre&s;s their feelings, in &s;o plain terms? "I hate him, for he always prophe&s;ieth evil concerning me."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="030548_0010_0FE7C55C55834748">
STILL more difficult it may be, for a chri&s;tian mini|&s;ter to give private coun&s;el, exhortation and reproof, without awakening the re&s;entment of tho&s;e whom he addre&s;&s;es, and bringing on him&s;elf the pointed marks of their di&s;plea&s;ure. Yet faithfulne&s;s to GOD, and to them, will not &s;uffer him to neglect this difficult and pain|ful duty.</P>
<P>THE &s;ervice, to which a mini&s;ter is often called, of vi&s;iting and conver&s;ing with the &s;ick, frequently involves in it great difficulties, trials, and temptations. He many times finds per&s;ons, in &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s, both of body and mind. Their &s;ituation &s;trongly excites compa&s;&s;ion. His heart mu&s;t be hard and unfeeling indeed, not to be tenderly moved. As to many of the&s;e per&s;ons, he may have no ground, from their former lives and con|ver&s;ation, to judge favourably of their &s;piritual &s;tate. He wi&s;hes to &s;peak words of comfort to them, and to apply the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, to di&s;pel their fears, and ea&s;e their pained minds. His bowels of pity and tenderne&s;s almo&s;t con&s;train him to do it. But he is anxious, left this &s;hould produce a fal&s;e peace, and lead them to re&s;t on deceptive hopes; left it &s;hould prevent that &s;en&s;e of guilt and danger, which they ought to en|tertain, in order to lay them low, humble, and penitent, at the feet of divine mercy, and to excite them to em|ploy their remaining moments, and their la&s;t breath, in ardent cries to a compa&s;&s;ionate GOD and SAVIOUR, for pardoning mercy, and &s;anctifying grace. What can the mini&s;ter do? If he deals plainly and faithfully, through from the mo&s;t benevolent motives, he may be deemed cruel: He may grieve and offend the &s;ick per&s;ons, and their &s;urrounding friends. Tho&s;e who have never been called to perform the part of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter's duty, which we are con&s;idering, will hardly conceive the dif|ficulties which in many ca&s;es attend it. Great wi&s;dom is requi&s;ite &s;o to unite fidelity and tenderne&s;s; that a dangerous pre&s;umption may not be encouraged, nor a fatal de&s;pondency produced, in the la&s;t and important days, and hours of &s;ickne&s;s, and of life.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030548_0011_0FE7C596D3108228">
ANOTHER thing, in the &s;ituation of a mini&s;ter of re|ligion, will, by per&s;ons acquainted with human nature, be con&s;idered as painful and &s;elfdenying, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> his being obliged to give up his independence, &s;o far as many of his people &s;eem to expect; &s;o far as to make him&s;elf &s;ub&s;ervient to their call, their will, and, too of|ten, to their humour; &s;o far as to have &s;carcely any time which he can call his own; &s;o far as not to be al|lowed to claim many of the common rights of human nature, with that free and independent &s;pirit, with which other good men among his people do it, without giv|ing any offence. He ought undoubtedly to adopt the language, and &s;entiment of the great apo&s;tle, who owned him&s;elf "his people's &s;ervant for JESUS' &s;ake;" and to be willing in a &s;ober and con&s;i&s;tent &s;en&s;e, "to become all things to all men; " i. e. to di&s;cover a kind, yielding, and conde&s;cending di&s;po&s;ition. But is it certain that this would give univer&s;al &s;atisfaction? There may be, in mo&s;t &s;ocieties, a number who expect their mini&s;ter &s;hould make a greater &s;acrifice than this to plea&s;e them. He mu&s;t forbear to declare his opinion, with that decent freedom which others u&s;e, upon religious, dome&s;tic, or political &s;ubjects, concerning which a diver&s;ity of &s;en|timents prevails among his people. Many individuals may be ready to claim a right of prohibiting their mini|&s;ter from expre&s;&s;ing an opinion contrary to their's. If he doth not yield to that prohibition, he will hardly fail of meeting with the di&s;plea&s;ure of the per&s;ons, from whom he dares to di&s;&s;ent. Mini&s;ters, as well now, as in the day of our SAVIOUR'S abode upon earth, need to be "wise as &s;erpents, and harmle&s;s as doves." And when they &s;incerely de&s;ire and endeavour to be &s;o, it is hardly to be expected they &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to give offence to none. Their conce&s;&s;ions may not come up to the wi&s;hes of &s;ome. Is it po&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e all, when &s;o many, and &s;o different tempers and di&s;po&s;itions, views and de&s;igns exi&s;t among their pari&s;hioners?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="030548_0012_0FE7C56196D69A78">
ONE of the mo&s;t painful trails, which Chri&s;t's mini|&s;ters often meet with, &s;till remains to be mentioned, namely, the little attention paid to their mo&s;t faithful in&s;tructions, by a great proportion of their people, and the &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s of their labours, in general. It is hard to &s;ay what can be more grievous and di&s;heartening to tho&s;e who have a proper concern for the pro&s;perity of the Redeemer's kingdom, and the &s;alvation of precious &s;ouls. Under this di&s;couragement, re&s;pecting the peo|ple to whom he mini&s;tred, the prophet Jeremiah once made this re&s;olution, "I will &s;peak no more to them, in the name of the LORD." This drew very moving com|plaints from &s;ome others of GOD'S antient prophets. "I have laboured in vain, and &s;pent my &s;trength for nought: I&s;rael will not be gathered. Who hath be|lieved our report?"</P>
<P>W<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> a mini&s;ter is diligent in his &s;tudies, fervent in his prayers, earne&s;t in his preaching, faithful in giving private coun&s;el, and circum&s;pect in his own conduct, yet then to ob&s;erve many among his people growing evidently more hardened and fixed in wickedne&s;s; many who will not give them&s;elves the trouble of attend|ing publick wor&s;hip; many more, who appear quite carele&s;s and unconcerned about the welfare of their immortal &s;ouls; and &s;ome among tho&s;e who have bound them&s;elves, by publick covenant engagements, to main|tain a life of &s;trict piety and virtue, yet walking very un&s;uitably to the profe&s;&s;ion they have made; what can more deeply and painfully wound him? Yet thus wound|ed, many times, are CHRIST'S faithful mini&s;ters. Their time, their &s;trength, and their lives are wearing away, without the comfort of &s;atisfactory evidences that "their labour is not in vain, in the LORD."</P>
<P>I HAVE been long, perhaps too long, in &s;ketching out the dark &s;ide of the picture of a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter's &s;itu|ation. Still nothing has been &s;aid but what I believe to be a ju&s;t repre&s;entation, and what is often realized, by per&s;ons in the &s;acred office. This may have led many
<PB N="15" REF="030548_0013_0FE7C59C8BD7C0E8">

<P>BUT is there no bright &s;ide to this picture? Is there no counterpart to what hath been de&s;cribed, of a mini|&s;ter's labours, trials and conflicts? Hath he no plea&s;ures and comforts, while di&s;charging the duties of his &s;ta|tion? He undoubtedly has, if he is faithful, and &s;ome which are exceedingly endearing and &s;upporting. The approbation of his own con&s;cience, and comfortable hopes of the Divine approbation. Sen&s;ible aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his labours, from the &s;pirit and grace of CHRIST. Delightful contemplations on the truths, and ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel, for which his profe&s;&s;ional bu&s;i|ne&s;s gives him great advantages. The friend&s;hip, the warm affection, the &s;incere good wi&s;hes, and the fervent prayers, of the mo&s;t amiable and worthy characters, among his people. Great &s;atisfaction, &s;ometimes, in &s;eeing "the plea&s;ure of the LORD pro&s;pering in his hands;" and "&s;ouls &s;locking to CHRIST, as doves to their windows:" And e&s;pecially the pro&s;pect of tho&s;e gracious rewards, which CHRIST hath promi&s;ed to his faithful mini&s;ters, when they &s;hall have fini&s;hed their cour&s;e, and the mini&s;try they have received. "Be ye faithful unto death, and I will give you a crown of life."</P>
<P>WILL not the faithful labourer, in the vineyard of CHRIST, who keeps the eye of his faith fixed on &s;uch gracious promi&s;es, be comforted, in all his tribulations? Will he not, like the apo&s;tle, though &s;orrowful, yet be always rejoicing? Yea it may be hoped that in the near views of death, he may be able in a good mea&s;ure hum|bly to adopt his joyful and triumphant language. <Q>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my de|parture is at hand. I have fought a good fight: I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e; I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, which the LORD, the righteous Judge, &s;hall give me, at that day.</Q></P>

WHO could be expected to enter into the &s;acred em|ployment, or long to continue in it, if nothing of this &s;ort was to be expected, or found, to ballance the many trials and difficulties which are in&s;eparable from it? More virtue and fortitude, than mo&s;t men are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, would be requi&s;ite to prevent their &s;hrinking from a &s;ervice, &s;o unpromi&s;ing, yea &s;o formidable. But our SAVIOUR doth not leave, thus comfortle&s;s, his servants, whom He calls into his vineyard. Though the rewards of their diligence and fidelity are principally re&s;erved to the future world, yet for their pre&s;ent &s;upport and comfort, He hath made &s;uch gracious declarations as the following "Lo I am with you always to the end of the world.

<P>WITH an expectation of both the&s;e, the trials<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Seven members of the church, and three or four others, oppo&s;ed his &s;ettlement.

SOON after his entering on the work he was vi&s;ited with &s;uch bodily infirmities, as led him to expect his life and labours would be &s;hort; that he &s;hould, in a little time, fini&s;h his cour&s;e, and the mini&s;try which he had received. Still, with truth he can &s;ay, he did not forget his vows and re&s;olutions, to work while it was day; nor did he feel an unwillingne&s;s to &s;pend what little &s;trength he had, in the &s;ervice of his beloved people. He did "not account his life dear to him," if he might &s;pend it &s;ucce&s;sfully in the great work, on which he had entered. To the honour of GOD, he de&s;ires thankfully to mention it, that he was &s;trengthened to go on, in his profe&s;&s;ional labours, much beyond his expectations, and with no long interruptions, for a number of years. With &s;entiments of gratitude and affection, he often re|flects on the kind, candid, and tender manner, in which his people treated him, and with which his feeble endea|vours to &s;erve them were received. They did not de&s;pi&s;e either his youth or his infirmities. The abundant marks of their &s;ympathetick tenderne&s;s and affection rendered all his labours among them, eminently labours of love, which were their own reward.</P>
<P>AFTER about eighteen years, feebly, yet plea&s;antly &s;pent, in their &s;ervice, GOD was plea&s;ed to vi&s;it him with a threatning fever, which reduced him, in appearence, to the very gates of the grave. The tenderne&s;s with which they mini&s;tred to him during that &s;ickne&s;s, is fre&s;h in his grateful remembrance. Their prayers,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A day of fa&s;ting and prayer was ob&s;erved by his people, on his account.</NOTE> which GOD was plea&s;ed graciou&s;ly to an&s;wer, called him back to further labours among them.

DURING about &s;eventeen years after this, he was not ab&s;ent from public wor&s;hip more than two &s;abbaths, ex|cepting the time when he had the &s;mall pox, which de|tained him three. Frequently, however, in that term of &s;eventeen years, has he come into this hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, weak and trembling, when it appeared to him hardly po&s;&s;ible that, without &s;pecial help from above, he &s;hould go through the &s;ervices of the day. Strength was, as he de&s;ires thankfully to record, from time to time, vouch|&s;afed to him.</P>
<P>ABOUT five years ago, he was vi&s;ited with a &s;low fever, which detained him from the hou&s;e of GOD, for five &s;ab|baths. Since that time, he hath, every Lord's day at|tended the &s;ervices of the &s;anctuary. He de&s;ired now to &s;et up his EBENEZER, acknowledging that "hitherto the LORD hath helped him." He hath &s;pared, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, to labour in his vineyard, feeble and imperfect as his labours have been, much longer than any of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors, in this &s;ociety. His term of &s;ervice hath been protracted beyond that of mo&s;t of his brethren, in the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>UPON retro&s;pecting this term of forty years, your mini&s;ter finds much to lament, much to be humbled for, of his faults, defects, and imperfections. His hope is in the abundant mercy of GOD, and the merit of that blood, which was &s;hed for the prie&s;thood as well as for the congregation; to pardon what has been ami&s;s; and to accept his feeble, though, he hopes, &s;incere attempts to promote the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and the good of &s;ouls. He finds, at the &s;ame time, many things which demand his gratitude to his DIVINE MASTER; particularly, that he hath called him to labour in &s;o plea&s;ant a part of his vineyard; that he hath &s;upported and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him &s;o long; that he hath rendered his &s;ervices, in a good degree ac|ceptable to his people; and that they have not, as he would humbly hope, been wholly u&s;ele&s;s and un&s;ucce&s;&s;|ful; though it is a painful con&s;ideration, that the evi|dences of their &s;ucce&s;s have been &s;o few.

<P>MANY events, in this &s;ociety have taken place within the term of forty years pa&s;t. The inhabitants of the precinct, and the members of the church, are, in a great mea&s;ure, changed. But 5 males, and 10 females, who were, &s;o long ago, members of the church, continue alive among us. The church then con&s;i&s;ted of 55 male members, and 87 females, re&s;ident, in the pari&s;h. It now con&s;i&s;ts of 42 males, and 99 females. The whole number is 1 le&s;s now than it was then. The di&s;pro|portion between males and females is increa&s;ed.

<P>THE number of per&s;ons admitted, who were not in communion with any church before, is 296, 7 have been received by recommendation from other churches. 32 have been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from this to other churches.

THE number of deaths in this &s;ociety, within the term of 40 years pa&s;t, according to the mo&s;t authentick re|cords, is 529. I have formerly mentioned, that the yearly average number of deaths was between 9 and 10. It was &s;o during the fir&s;t 19 years of my mini&s;try. In the la&s;t 21 years, in which the &s;mall pox hath &s;everal times, prevailed among us; the dy&s;entry, and &s;ome other epidemick di&s;tempers, the average number has been con&s;iderably greater.</P>
<P>OF the 529 per&s;ons who have died, 9 have arrived to the age of 90 years, or upwards, which is nearly in the proportion of 1 to 60. 42 have lived to be 80 years old and upwards, be&s;ides the 9 who &s;urvived 90 years. This &s;hews about 1 in 12 to arrive to the age of 80 years.</P>
<P>74 per&s;ons have died between 70 and 80 years of age, which, in connection with the calculations above, &s;hews that as great a proportion as 1 in 5, of tho&s;e who have died, in the term afore&s;aid, have lived to &s;ee three&s;core years and ten, or more. I cannot a&s;certain the number of births in this &s;ociety, during the term of 40 years pa&s;t. It may be about 1100.</P>
<P>THE above calculations &s;hew, that a greater propor|tion of per&s;ons, among us, than has been generally &s;up|po&s;ed, has lived to what we may call old age. If a re|gular, &s;ober, and virtuous mode of living may be a&s;&s;ign|ed, as the natural cau&s;e, it reflects honour on the &s;ociety. A pre&s;umptive argument is hereby &s;ugge&s;ted, in favour of the &s;ituation, air and climate, as being friendly to health, and long life. We are bound however ultimate|ly to a&s;cribe it, to his kind providence, who is the "GOD of our life and the length of our days."</P>
<P>THE number of females, who have lived to old age, is a little larger than that of males. There is not one man, now in the &s;ociety, quite 80 years old. There is one woman, in her 94th year; and &s;everal between 80 and 90 years old. There are 11 women, and 7 men, who&s;e age is between 70 and 80 years, there are 7 men and 34 women in a &s;tate of widowhood.</P>

among you. Not a few of them were his intimate and confidential friends, whom he often met, with great delight, in the hou&s;e of GOD, and at the table of CHRIST, mingling hearts and affections, in the exerci&s;es of piety and devotion.

And he &s;ometimes entertains the plea&s;ing hope, that he may have been the feeble unworthy in&s;tru|ment of good to their &s;ouls, in helping them forward to the heavenly world.</P>
<P>IF the names of tho&s;e who have died, from among us, within the term often mentioned above, &s;hould be called over, mo&s;t of us &s;hould hear &s;ome which de&s;ignated our neare&s;t and deare&s;t connexions. Tender parents; be|loved partners in life; dear children; affectionate bre|thren and &s;i&s;ters. Calling them to mind may afford a melancholly kind of plea&s;ure. A care to be followers of them, &s;o far as they were of CHRIST, excited and &s;trengthened, will be e&s;&s;entially beneficial to us. We cannot &s;ee them again, in the fle&s;h, "till the heavens be no more." How happy if we may then meet them, at the right hand of CHRIST, to unite, in tracing the my&s;terious &s;teps of Divine providence; and in cele|brating the wonders of redeeming love! Soon our bodies, like their's, will be laid in the grave, and be mouldering in the du&s;t. A &s;ucce&s;&s;or to your pre&s;ent pa&s;tor, may perhaps, half a century hence, make re|marks on our deaths, memory, and character, as we do now, on tho&s;e of our friends, who are gone before us. It is earne&s;tly to be wi&s;hed, that the&s;e commemorative anecdotes, may not only afford tran&s;ient amu&s;ement, but u&s;eful in&s;truction, re&s;pecting the pa&s;&s;ing nature of time; the &s;hortne&s;s of human life; and the importance of im|proving well every day as it pa&s;&s;es.</P>

It is well under&s;tood that the fund, which the church now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, proceeded from the &s;ale of a number of lots of land, which belonged to it. This &s;ale was made more than 30 years ago. The money produced by it was let out upon intere&s;t. The intere&s;t, for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, was added to the principal.

<P>AND to it's honour, it may be mentioned, that a &s;pirit of candor and accommodation hath generally marked it's proceedings, to the maintaining peace and harmo|ny. This was the ca&s;e in building this hou&s;e for

This confe&s;&s;ion of faith, though excellent in general, was long, and contained &s;ome religious tenets, concerning which many pious per&s;ons have their doubts and difficulties. About the year 1767, it was &s;ugge&s;ted to the church, that &s;omething more conci&s;e, and expre&s;&s;ed in more general terms, might better an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. A &s;ub&s;titute of that kind was propo&s;ed, and peaceably adopted.</P><P>At a meeting of the church, April 11th 1793, it was &s;ugge&s;ted, whether it might not be advi&s;eable to make &s;ome alterations in the modes and forms of admitting per&s;ons into communion. A committee was cho&s;en to con&s;ider the matter and report, what they think proper to be done. The committee, at an ad|journment of the meeting, reported a general form of chri&s;tian union, and covenant engagements, in which all per&s;ons admitted are to agree. This was adopted without oppo&s;ition. The &s;aid committee al&s;o reported the following method of admit|ting per&s;ons, as, in their opinion, proper and advi&s;eable, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>That a per&s;on, de&s;iring admi&s;&s;ion, &s;hall apply to the minister, and make his de&s;ire known; that the mini&s;ter &s;hall mention this, in public; and if no valid objection is offered again&s;t the per&s;on, within a fortnight, the name of the per&s;on &s;hall be in&s;erted in the church covenant, before-mentioned. And when the mini&s;ter hath notified the church, that this has been done, &s;uch per&s;on &s;hall be con&s;idered as a member of the church, and be treated as &s;uch.</Q> This report was accepted by the church, the following clau&s;e being added, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>Provided however, that if any per&s;on &s;hall chu&s;e rather to be admitted into the church, in either of the methods which have been heretofore u&s;ed, they &s;hall readily be allowed their choice.</Q></P></NOTE> of admitting per&s;ons to church fellow&s;hip, and chri&s;tian privileges. Few di&s;putes and controver&s;ies have prevailed in the church or &s;ociety. If the members have not always been <Q>perfectly joined to|gether in the &s;ame mind, and in the &s;ame judgment,</Q>
<PB N="28" REF="030548_0026_0FE7C578B6866F60">
yet a di&s;po&s;ition has prevailed, to permit every one freely to enjoy the right of his private opinion, provided he doth not break in upon the rights of others. This &s;pi|rit of candor and mutual forbearance has happily tended to the peace of the community. GOD grant it may abound among us, more and more.</P>
<P>BUT whether the &s;cenes through which we pa&s;s, or the events upon which we are remarking, be plea&s;ing or painful; one thing is certain; we &s;hall be here but a little while, to ob&s;erve them. The fa&s;hion of the world changes, and pa&s;&s;es away, and we are changing, and pa&s;&s;ing away with it.</P>
<P>YOUR pa&s;tor need not tell you that he is in the decline of life. Evidences of it cannot e&s;cape his and your ob&s;ervation. He de&s;ires to adore that kind providence, which has &s;u&s;tained him &s;o long. And he takes this op|portunity to expre&s;s &s;entiments of gratitude to his be|loved people, for the candor and friend&s;hip with which they have generally treated him. He wi&s;hes never to forget the many, many expre&s;&s;ions of their kindne&s;s and affection. Unkindne&s;&s;es, and injuries he de&s;ires to re|member none. He wi&s;hes to be in&s;trumental of pro|moting their be&s;t intere&s;t, during the &s;hort remaining period, GOD may continue him in the mini&s;try. He earne&s;tly reque&s;ts their prayers that he may be &s;o. He has no ground to calculate upon a long continuance. He can expect no other, than e'er long to be laid by, as a broken, or worn out ve&s;&s;el. But while any con&s;ider|able
<PB N="29" REF="030548_0027_0FE7C5B3E51266F8">
degree of bodily &s;trength, and powers of mind, is continued to him, he hopes not to be a mere cumberer of the ground, or burden to &s;ociety. To &s;urvive all capa|city of u&s;efulne&s;s, appears to him an event, by no means to be de&s;ired.</P>
<P>THOUGH he &s;incerely wi&s;hes that his private inter|cour&s;e among his people may be agreeable to them, and mini&s;ter to their profit; yet probably his occa&s;ional vi&s;its may not, in frequency, come up to their expecta|tions, or his own inclination. Should this be the ca&s;e, their candor, and good &s;en&s;e will furni&s;h &s;ufficient apo|logies. They will do him the ju&s;tice, to acknowledge, that he hath not been a &s;tranger, in their families, in times of &s;ickne&s;s and trouble. As he hath taken a tender and &s;ympathetick part, in their afflictions, it is his de&s;ire to do &s;o &s;till, to the extent of his &s;trength and abilities.</P>
<P>HE feels great &s;olicitude for the utility and &s;ucce&s;s of his publick <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ours and in&s;tructions. The &s;mall capa|city he has, as a publick religious teacher, he de&s;ires di|ligently and faithfully to improve. Still it lies very much with his hearers to determine, whether the&s;e en|deavours &s;hall be beneficial to them or not. Without a &s;tated, &s;erious, and prayerful attention, on their part, what profit can they expect to receive? He earne&s;tly intreats them not refu&s;e &s;uch an attention.</P>
<P>THE remarks which have been made, at this time, he hopes will be received with the &s;ame candor and friend|&s;hip, with which they have been prepared, and deliver|ed. For a publick &s;peaker to &s;ay &s;o much concerning him&s;elf, may be deemed rather indelicate. The &s;ubject and the occa&s;ion are his apology. He hath not been wont to tre&s;pa&s;s in this way. And this probably may be the la&s;t time, that any thing of this &s;ort, will be de|livered by him, in this place. Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome of the hi&s;|torical anecdotes, in the foregoing pages, may be thought too &s;mall and trifling to have a place there. It was the de&s;ire of the writer not to offend in this way. Little incidents generally intere&s;t the feelings of per&s;ons im|mediately concerned in them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="030548_0028_0FE7C57E0CDA2558">
To conclude,</P>
<P>THE pa&s;tor of this flock con&s;iders his time, all his little &s;trength, whether of body or mind, and even his life, devoted to the honour of CHRIST, and the promo|tion of their &s;piritual good; and thinks he can &s;incerely adopt the language of the apo&s;tle, and &s;ay, that he "doth not account his life dear to him," if it may be thus faith|fully, and u&s;efully &s;pent; and "his cour&s;e, and mini&s;try fini&s;hed with joy."</P>

GOD grant that he and they may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;|charge the re&s;pective duties of the relation, as &s;hall promote the joy and felicity of both, in the coming world.</P>
