<P>THESE words contain the ingenuous con|fe&s;&s;ion of King Agrippa, which having &s;ome reference to what went before, it may not be improper to relate to you the &s;ub&s;tance of the preceding ver&s;es, to which the&s;e words are &s;o clo&s;ely connected. The chapter, then, out of which the text is taken, contains an admir|able account the great St. Paul gave of his wonderful conver&s;ion from Judai&s;m to Chri&s;|tianity, when he was called to make his de|fence before Fe&s;tus and another Gentile go|vernor.&mdash;Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord had long &s;ince fore|told, that, <HI>when the</HI> SON OF MAN <HI>&s;hould be lifted up, his di&s;ciples &s;hould be brought before kings for his name's &s;ake, for a te&s;timony unto them;</HI>&mdash; and very good was the de&s;ign of Infinite Wi&s;|dom in thus ordaining it, for Chri&s;tianity being, from the very beginning, a doctrine of the cro&s;s, the princes and rulers of the earth tho't them&s;elves too high to be in&s;tructed by &s;uch mean teachers, or too happy to be di&s;turbed by &s;uch unwelcome truths, and, therefore, would have always continued &s;trangers to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified, had not the apo&s;tles, by being

arraigned before them as criminals, gained op|portunities of preaching to them Je&s;us and the re&s;urrection. St. Paul knew full well that this was the main rea&s;on why his ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, at this time, permitted his enemies to arraign him at a public bar, and, therefore, in compli|ance with the divine will, thinks it not &s;uffici|ent barely to make his defence, but endeavors, at the &s;ame time, to convert his judges. And this he did with &s;uch demon&s;tration of the &s;pi|rit, and of power, that Fe&s;tus, unwilling to be convinced by the &s;tronge&s;t evidence, cries out, with a loud voice&mdash;<HI>Much learning doth make thee mad</HI>&mdash;to which the brave apo&s;tle, like a true follower of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oly Je&s;us, meekly replies&mdash;<HI>I am not mad, mo&s;t noble F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us, but &s;peak forth the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s.</HI>&mdash; But, in all probability, &s;eeing King Agrippa more affected with his di&s;cour&s;e, and ob&s;erv|ing in him an inclination to know the truth, he applies him&s;elf more particular to him, <HI>the King,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>knoweth of the&s;e things, before whom al&s;o I &s;peak freely, for I am per&s;uaded that none of the&s;e things are hidden from him</HI>; and then, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;&s;ible he might complete his wi&s;hed-for conver&s;ion, he, with an inimitable &s;train of oratory, addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;till more clo&s;ely <HI>King Agrippa, believe&s;t thou the prophets? I know that thou believe&s;t them:</HI> At which the pa&s;&s;ions of the king began to work &s;o &s;trongly, that he was obliged, in open court, to own him|&s;elf affected by the pri&s;oner's preaching, and ingenuou&s;ly to cry out, <HI>Paul, almo&s;t thou per|&s;uade&s;t me to be a Chri&s;tian;</HI> which words taken

with the context, afford us a lively repre&s;enta|tion of the different reception the doctrine of Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters, who come in the power and &s;pirit of St. Paul, meets with now a-days in the minds of men; for notwith&s;tanding they, like this great apo&s;tle, &s;peak forth the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s, and with &s;uch energy and power, that all their adver&s;aries cannot ju&s;tly gain&s;ay or re&s;i&s;t, yet too many, with the mo&s;t noble Fe&s;tus before-mentioned, being like him, either too proud to be taught, or too &s;en&s;ual, too carele&s;s, or too worldly-minded to live up to their doctrine, in order to excu&s;e them&s;elves, cry out, that much learning, much &s;tudy, or what is more unaccountable, much piety hath made them mad; and though, ble&s;&s;ed be God, all do not thus di&s;believe our report, yet a|mong&s;t tho&s;e many others, who gladly receive the word, and confe&s;s that we &s;peak the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s, there are &s;o few, who ar|rive at any higher degree of piety than that of Agrippa, or are any farther per&s;uaded than to be almo&s;t Chri&s;tians, that I cannot but think it highly nece&s;&s;ary to warn my dear hearers of the danger of &s;uch a &s;tate; and therefore, from the words of the text, &s;hall endeavor to con&s;ider the&s;e three things:

<ITEM>II. What are the chief rea&s;ons why &s;o many are no more than almo&s;t Chri&s;tians.</ITEM>

<ITEM><PB N="6" REF="028080_0005_0FD6962E108B32F0">IV. I &s;hall conclude with a general exhor|tation, to &s;et all upon &s;triving not only to be almo&s;t, but altogether Chri&s;tians.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. And fir&s;t I am to con&s;ider what is meant by an almo&s;t Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>An almo&s;t Chri&s;tian, then, if we con&s;ider him in re&s;pect to his duty to God, is one that halts between two opinions, that wavers be|tween Chri&s;t and the world, that would recon|cile God and Mammon, that is, light and dark|ne&s;s, Chri&s;t and B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lial. It is true, he has an inclination to religion, but then he is very cau|tious how he goes too far in it: His fal&s;e heart is always crying out&mdash;Spare thy&s;elf, do thy&s;elf no harm. He prays, indeed, that God's <HI>will may be done on earth, as it is in heaven;</HI> but then, notwith&s;tanding he is very partial in his obe|dience, and fondly hopes that God will not be extreme to mark every thing that he wilfully does ami&s;s, though an in&s;pired apo&s;tle has told him, that he that <HI>offends in one point is guilty of all.</HI> Above all, he is one that depends much on outward ordinances, and upon that ac|count looks upon him&s;elf as righteous, and de|&s;pi&s;es others; though, at the &s;ame time, he may be as great a &s;tranger to the divine life, as any other per&s;on what&s;oever. In &s;hort, he is fond of the form, but never experiences the power of godline&s;s in his heart: He goes on, year af|ter year, feeding and attending on the means of grace; but then, like Pharaoh's lean kine, is never the better, but rather the wor&s;e for them.</P>
<P>If you con&s;ider him in re&s;pect to his neigh|bor,
<PB N="7" REF="028080_0006_0FD6963010AB2A88">
he is one that is &s;trictly ju&s;t to all; but then this does not proceed from any love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o God, or regard to man, but only out of a prin|ciple of &s;elf love, becau&s;e he knows di&s;hone&s;ty will &s;poil his reputation, and con&s;equently hin|der his thriving in the world.</P>
<P>He is one that depends much on being ne|gatively good, and contents him&s;elf with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done no one any harm, though he reads in the go&s;pel, that <HI>the unprofit|able &s;ervant was ca&s;t into outer darkne&s;s,</HI> and the barren &s;ig-tree cur&s;ed and dried up from the roots, not for bearing bad, but no fruit.</P>
<P>He is no enemy to charitable contributions in public, if not too frequently recommended; but then he is unacquainted with the kind of|fices of <HI>vi&s;iting the &s;ick and impri&s;oned, cloathing the naked, and relieving the hungry</HI> in a private manner. He thinks that the&s;e things belong only to the clergy, though his own fal&s;e heart tells him, that nothing but pride keeps him from exerci&s;ing the&s;e acts of humility, and that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the xxvth chapter of St. Mat|thew, condemns per&s;ons to everla&s;ting puni&s;h|ment, not for being fornicators, drunkards, or extortioners, but for neglecting the&s;e charitable offices. <HI>When the Son of Man,</HI> &s;ays our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf, <HI>&s;hall come in his glory, he &s;hall &s;et the &s;heep on his right hand, and the goals on his left. And then &s;hall he &s;ay to them on his left hand, Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels: For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat; I was thir&s;|ty,
<PB N="8" REF="028080_0007_0FD696348A748768">
and ye gave me no drink; I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye cloathed me not; &s;ick and in pri&s;on, and ye vi&s;ited me not. Then &s;hall they al&s;o &s;ay, Lord, when &s;aw we thee an hungred, or athir&s;t, or a &s;tranger, or naked, or &s;ick, or in pri|&s;on, and did not mini&s;ter unto thee? Then &s;hall be an&s;wer them, Verily, I &s;ay unto you, ina&s;much as ye have not done it unto one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my brethren, ye did it not unto me: And the&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment.</HI> I thought pro|per to give you this whole pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture at large, becau&s;e our Saviour lays &s;uch a parti|cular &s;tre&s;s upon it; and yet, notwith&s;tanding it is &s;o little regarded, that were we to judge by the practice of Chri&s;tians, one &s;hould be tempt|ed to think there were no &s;uch ver&s;es in the Bible.</P>
<P>But to proceed in our character of an almo&s;t Chri&s;tian. If we con&s;ider him in re&s;pect of him|&s;elf; as before we &s;aid he was &s;trictly hone&s;t to his neighbor, &s;o he is likewi&s;e &s;trictly &s;ober in him&s;elf; but then both his hone&s;ty and &s;obrie|ty proceed from the &s;ame principle of a fal&s;e &s;elf love. It is true he runs not into the &s;ame ex|ce&s;s of roit with other men, but then it is not out of obedience to the laws of God, but either becau&s;e his con&s;titution will not away with in|temperance, or rather becau&s;e he is cautious of forfeiting his reputation, or unfitting him|&s;elf for temporal bu&s;ine&s;s. But though he is &s;o prudent as to avoid intemperance and exce&s;s, for the rea&s;ons before-mentioned, yet he always goes to the extremity of what is lawful. It is
<PB N="9" REF="028080_0008_0FD69636E87D8250">
true, he is no drunkard, but then he has no Chri&s;tian &s;elf-denial. He cannot think our Sa|viour to be &s;o au&s;tere a ma&s;ter, as to deny us to indulge our&s;elves in &s;ome particulars; and &s;o by this means he is kept out of a &s;en&s;e of true religion, as much as if he lived in debauchery, or any other crime whatever. As to &s;ettling his principles as well as practice, he is guided more by the world, than by the word of God. As for his part, he cannot think the way to hea|ven &s;o narrow as &s;ome would make it; and, therefore, con&s;iders not &s;o much what &s;cripture requires, as what &s;uch and &s;uch a good man does, or what will be&s;t &s;uit his own corrupt in|clinations. Upon this account, he is not only very cautious him&s;elf, but likewi&s;e very careful of young converts, who&s;e faces are &s;et heaven|ward, and, therefore, is always acting the De|vil's part, and bidding them &s;pare them&s;elves, though they are doing no more than what the &s;cripture &s;trictly requires them to do; the con|&s;equence of which is, that he &s;uffers not him|&s;elf to enter into the kingdom of God, and tho&s;e that are entering in he hinders.</P>
<P>Thus lives the almo&s;t Chri&s;tian; not that I can &s;ay I have fully de&s;cribed him to you, but, from the&s;e out-lines and &s;ketches of his cha|racter, if your con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iences have done their pro|per office, and made a particular application of what has been &s;aid to your own hearts, I cannot but fear that &s;ome of you may ob&s;erve &s;ome features in his picture, odious as it is, re&s;em|bling your own, and, therefore, cannot but hope,
<PB N="10" REF="028080_0009_0FD6963A1D4754B0">
at the &s;ame time, that you join with the apo&s;|tle in the words immediately following the text, and wi&s;h your&s;elves not only almo&s;t, but altogether Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="2">II. But I proceed to the &s;econd general thing propo&s;ed, namely, to con&s;ider the rea&s;ons why &s;o many are no more than almo&s;t Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="1">1. And the fir&s;t rea&s;on I &s;hall mention is&mdash; becau&s;e &s;o many &s;et out with fal&s;e notions of religion, and though they live in a Chri&s;tian country, yet know not what Chri&s;tianity is.&mdash; This, perhaps may be e&s;teemed a hard &s;aying, but experience &s;adly evinces the truth of it; for &s;ome place religion in being of this or that communion, more in morality, mo&s;t in a round of duties, and a model of performances, and few, very few, acknowledge it to be what it really is, a thorough inward change of nature, a divine life, a vital participation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, an union of the &s;oul with God, which the apo&s;|tle expre&s;&s;es by &s;aying, <HI>He that is joined to the Lord is one &s;pirit.</HI> Hence it happens that &s;o many, even of the mo&s;t knowing profe&s;&s;ors, when you come to conver&s;e with them con|cerning the e&s;&s;ence, the life, the &s;oul of reli|gion, I mean our new birth in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, confe&s;s them&s;elves quite ignorant of the mat|ter, and cry out with Nicodemus, <HI>How can this thing be?</HI> And no wonder then, that &s;o many are only almo&s;t Chri&s;tians, when &s;o many know not what Chri&s;tianity is: No marvel &s;o many take up with the form, when they are quite &s;trangers to the power of godline&s;s, or content them&s;elves
<PB N="11" REF="028080_0010_0FD6963B492C7ED8">
with the &s;hadow, when they know &s;o little a|bout the &s;ub&s;tance of it. And this is one cau&s;e why &s;o many are almo&s;t, why &s;o few are alto|gether Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="2">2. A &s;econd rea&s;on that may be a&s;&s;igned why &s;o many are no more than almo&s;t Chri&s;tians, is a &s;ervile fear of man Multitudes there are, and have been, who, though awakened to a &s;en&s;e of the divine life, and <HI>have ta&s;ted and felt the powers of the world to come,</HI> yet out of a ba&s;e, &s;inful fear of being counted &s;ingular, or con|temned of men, have &s;uffered all tho&s;e good impre&s;&s;ions to wear off again. It is true, they have &s;ome e&s;teem for Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but then, like Nicodemus, they would <HI>come to him</HI> only <HI>by night:</HI> They are willing to &s;erve him, but then they would do it <HI>&s;ecretly, for fear of the Jews:</HI> They <HI>have a mind to &s;ee Je&s;us,</HI> but then <HI>they can|not come to him becau&s;e of the pre&s;s;</HI> for fear of being laughed at, and ridiculed by tho&s;e with whom they u&s;ed to &s;it at meat. But well did our Saviour prophe&s;y of &s;uch per&s;ons, <HI>How can ye love me which receive honor one of another?</HI> A|las! have they never read, that <HI>the friend&s;hip of this world is enmity with God;</HI> and that our Lord him&s;elf has threatened, <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall be a&s;ham|ed of me, or of my words, in this wicked and adul|terous generation, of him &s;hall the Son of Man be a&s;hamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father, and of his holy angels.</HI> But no wonder that &s;o many are no more that almo&s;t Chri&s;tians, &s;ince &s;o many <HI>love the prai&s;e of men more than the ho|nor which cometh of God.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="028080_0011_0FD6963E66D9C918">3. A third rea&s;on why &s;o many are no more than almo&s;t Chri&s;tians, is a reigning love of money. This was the pitiable ca&s;e of that for|ward young man in the go&s;pel, who came run|ning to our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, and kneeling before him, enquired what <HI>he mu&s;t do to inherit eternal life;</HI> to which our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter replied, <HI>Thou knowe&s;t the commandments, do not kill, do not com|mit adultery, do not &s;teal;</HI> to which the young man replied, <HI>All the&s;e have I kept from my youth.</HI> But when our Lord proceeded to tell him, <HI>Yet lacke&s;t thou one thing, go &s;ell all that thou ha&s;t and give to the poor; he was grieved at that &s;aying, and went away &s;orrowful, for he had great po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions!</HI> Poor youth! he had a good mind to be a Chri&s;tian, and to inherit eternal life, but tho't it too dear, if it could be purcha&s;ed at no le&s;s an expence than of his whole e&s;tate! And thus many, both young and old, now-a-days, come running to wor&s;hip our ble&s;&s;ed Lord in public, and kneel before him in private, and enquire at his go&s;pel, what mu&s;t they do to inherit eter|nal life; but when they find they m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> renounce the &s;elf-enjoyment of riches, and for&s;ake all in affection to follow him, they cry&mdash;The Lord pardon us in this thing!&mdash;We pray thee have us excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>But is heaven &s;o &s;mall a trifle in &s;uch men's e&s;teem, as not to be worth a little gilded earth? Is eternal life &s;o mean a purcha&s;e, as not to de|&s;erve the temporary renunciation of a few tran|&s;itory riches? Sur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly it is. But however incon|&s;i&s;tent &s;uch a behaviour may be, this inordi|nate
<PB N="13" REF="028080_0012_0FD696449F657DA8">
love of money is too evidently the com|mon and fatal cau&s;e, why &s;o many are no more than almo&s;t Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="4">4. Nor is the reigning love of plea&s;ure a le&s;s uncommon, or a le&s;s fatal cau&s;e, why &s;o many are no more than almo&s;t Chri&s;tians. Thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands there are, who de&s;pi&s;e rich|es, and would willingly be true di&s;ciples of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, would parting with their money make them &s;o; but when they are told, that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord has &s;aid, that <HI>who&s;oever will come after him mu&s;t deny him&s;elf.</HI> Like the pi|tiable young man, before-mentioned, <HI>they go a|way &s;orrowful;</HI> for they have too great a love for &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures. They will, like Herod, perhaps &s;end for the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, as he did for John, and <HI>hear them gladly;</HI> but touch them in their Herodias, tell them they mu&s;t part with &s;uch or &s;uch a darling plea&s;ure, and with wicked Ahab they cry out&mdash;<HI>Ha&s;t thou found us, O our enemy?</HI> Tell them of the nece&s;|&s;ity of mortification, fa&s;ting, and &s;elf-denial, and it is as difficult to them to hear, as if you was to bid them cut off a right hand or pluck out a right eye: They cannot think our ble&s;&s;ed Lord requires &s;o much at their hands, though an in&s;pired apo&s;tle has commanded us to <HI>mor|tify our members which are upon earth;</HI> and he him&s;elf, even after he had converted millions, and was very near arrived to the end of his race, yet profe&s;&s;ed that it was his daily practice to <HI>keep under his body, and bring it into &s;ubjection, le&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="028080_0013_0FD69646375B5748">
after he had preached to others, he him&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t-away!</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ome men would be wi&s;er than this great apo&s;tle, and chalk out to us what they fal&s;ely imagine an ea&s;ier way to happine&s;s. They would flatter us we may go to heaven without offering violence to our &s;en&s;ual appetites, and <HI>enter into the &s;trait gate</HI> without &s;triving again&s;t our carnal inclinations. And this is another rea&s;on why &s;o many are only almo&s;t, and not altogether Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="5">5. The fifth and la&s;t rea&s;on I &s;hall a&s;&s;ign why &s;o many are only almo&s;t Chri&s;tians, is a &s;ickle|ne&s;s and in&s;tability of temper.</P>
<P>It has been, no doubt, the misfortune that many a mini&s;ter and &s;incere Chri&s;tian has met with, to weep and wail over numbers of pro|mi&s;ing converts, who &s;eemingly began in the &s;pirit, but after a while have fell away, and ba&s;ely ended in the fle&s;h, and this not for want of right notions in religion, nor out of a &s;ervile fear of man, nor out of love of money or &s;en|&s;ual plea&s;ure, but out of an in&s;tability and &s;ickle|ne&s;s of temper. They looked upon religion merely for novelty, as &s;omething which plea&s;|ed them for a while, but after their curio&s;ity was &s;atisfied, they have laid it a&s;ide again. Like the young man that came to &s;ee Je&s;us, with a linen cloth about his naked body, they have fol|lowed him for a &s;ea&s;on, but when temptations have come to take hold on them, for want of a little more re&s;olution, they have been &s;trip|ped of all their good intentions, and fled away

<P N="3"><PB N="16" REF="028080_0015_0FD628B9828F9808">III. Proceed now to the third general thing propo&s;ed, namely, to con&s;ider the folly of be|ing no more than an almo&s;t Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t proof I &s;hall give of the folly of &s;uch a proceeding is&mdash;that it is ineffectual to &s;alvation. It is true, &s;uch men are almo&s;t good, but almo&s;t to hit the mark, is really to mi&s;s it. God requires us to <HI>love him with all our hearts, with all our &s;ouls, and with all our &s;trength:</HI> He loves us too well to admit any rival, becau&s;e &s;o far as our hearts are empty of God, &s;o far mu&s;t they be unhappy. The Devil, indeed, like the fal&s;e mother that came before Solomon, would have our hearts divided, as &s;he would have had the child, but God, like the true mother, will have all or none. <HI>My &s;on, give me thy heart,</HI> thy whole heart, is the general call to all; and if this be not done, we never can expect the di|vine mercy.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons may play the hypocrite, but God, at the great day, will &s;trike them dead, (as he did Ananias and Sapphira by the mouth of his &s;er|vant Peter) for pretending to offer him all their hearts, when they keep back from him the great|e&s;t part. They may, perhaps, impo&s;e upon their fellow-creatures for a while, but he that enabled Elijah to cry out, <HI>Come in thou wife of Jeroboam,</HI> when &s;he came di&s;gui&s;ed to enquire about her &s;ick &s;on, will al&s;o di&s;cover them through their mo&s;t artful di&s;&s;imulations, and if <HI>their hearts are not whole with him, appoint them their portion with hypocrites and unbelievers.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> what renders an half-way piety
<PB N="17" REF="028080_0016_0FD69651F1DDABB8">
more inexcu&s;able is, that it is not only in&s;uffi|cient to our own &s;alvation, but al&s;o mo&s;t pre|judicial to that of others.</P>
<P>An almo&s;t Chri&s;tian is one of the mo&s;t hurt|ful creatures in the world; he is a wolf in &s;heep's cloathing&mdash;he is one of tho&s;e fal&s;e prophets our ble&s;&s;ed Lord bids us beware of in his &s;ermon on the mount, who would per&s;uade men, that the way to heaven is broader than it really is; and thereby, as it was ob&s;erved before, <HI>enter not into the kingdom of God them&s;elves, and tho&s;e that are entering in they hinder.</HI> The&s;e, the&s;e are the men that turn the world into a lukewarm Lao|dicean &s;pirit&mdash;that hang out fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e lights, and &s;o &s;hipwreck unthinking benighted &s;ouls in their voyage to the haven of eternity. The&s;e are they that are greater enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, than infidels them&s;elves; for of an unbeliever every one will be aware, but an al|mo&s;t Chri&s;tian, through his &s;ubtle hypocri&s;y, draws away many after him, and therefore mu&s;t expect to receive the greater damnation.</P>
<P>But, <HI>thirdly,</HI> as it is mo&s;t prejudicial to our|&s;elves, and hurtful to others, &s;o it is the greate&s;t piece of ingratitude we can expre&s;s towards our Lord and Ma&s;ter Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For did he come down from heaven, and &s;hed his precious blood, to purcha&s;e the&s;e hearts of ours, and &s;hall we only give him half of them?

approve our&s;elves to him, and &s;o let him &s;ee the travail of his &s;oul, and be &s;atisfied!</P>
<P>Had any of us purcha&s;ed a &s;lave at a mo&s;t expen&s;ive rate, that was before involved in the utmo&s;t mi&s;eries and torments, and &s;o mu&s;t have continued for ever, had we &s;hut up our bowels of compa&s;&s;ion from him; and was this &s;lave af|terwards to grow rebellious, or deny giving us but half his &s;ervice&mdash;how, how &s;hould we ex|claim again&s;t his ba&s;e ingratitude?

<P>That I may come to the la&s;t thing propo&s;ed, namely, to add a word or two of exhortation to be not only almo&s;t, but altogether Chri&s;tians, let us &s;corn all &s;uch ba&s;e and treacherous treat|ment of our King and Saviour&mdash;nay, our God.

They cho&s;e ju&s;t &s;o much of religion as will di&s;turb them in their lu&s;ts, and follow their lu&s;ts &s;o far as to deprive them&s;elves of the comforts of religion: Where|as, on the contrary, would they &s;incerely leave all in affection, and give their hearts wholly to God, they would then (and they cannot till then) experience the un&s;peakable plea&s;ure of having a mind at unity with it&s;elf, and enjoy &s;uch a peace of God, which, even in this life, pa&s;&s;es all under&s;tanding, and which they were entire &s;trangers to before.

<Q>Brethren, pray for us.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF we enquire, why there is &s;o little love to be found among&s;t Chri&s;tians, why the very characteri&s;tic, by which every one &s;hould know that we are di&s;ciples, of the holy Je&s;us, is al|mo&s;t bani&s;hed out of the Chri&s;tian world&mdash;we &s;hall find it, in a great mea&s;ure owing to a ne|glect or &s;uperficial performance of that mo&s;t God-like part of &s;ecret prayer INTERCESSION, or imploring the divine grace or mercy in be|half of others.</P>
<P>Some forget this duty of praying for others, becau&s;e they &s;eldom remember to pray for them|&s;elves; and even good people, who are con&s;tant in praying to their Father, which is in heaven, are often &s;o con&s;trained and &s;elfi&s;h in their ad|dre&s;&s;es to the throne of grace, that they do not enlarge their petitions for the welfare of their fellow Chri&s;tians as they ought, and thereby fall &s;hort of attaining that Chri&s;tian charity, that unfeigned love of their brethren, which their &s;ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed profe&s;&s;ion obliges them to a&s;pire after, and without which, though they would

<HI>be&s;tow all their goods to feed the poor, and even give their bodies to be burned, yet it would profit them nothing.</HI></P>
<P>Since then the&s;e things are &s;o, I &s;hall, from the words of the text, (though originally in|tended to be more confined) endeavor to &s;hew,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That it is every Chri&s;tian's duty to pray for others, as well as for him&s;elf.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Who are tho&s;e that we ought to pray for, and in what manner we &s;hall do it. And,</ITEM>

<P N="1">I. Fir&s;t, then, I &s;hall endeavor to &s;how, that it is every Chri&s;tian's duty to pray for others, as well as for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now prayer is a duty founded on natural re|ligion; the very heathens never neglected it, though many Chri&s;tian heathens among&s;t us do; And it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o e&s;&s;ential to Chri&s;tianity, that you might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rea&s;onably expect to find a living man without breath, as a true Chri&s;tian with|out the &s;pirit of prayer and &s;upplication: Thus, no &s;ooner was St. Paul converted, but <HI>behold he prayeth,</HI> &s;aith the Lord Almighty. And thus will it be with every child of God, as &s;oon as he becomes &s;uch, prayer being truly called&mdash; <HI>The natural cry of the new born &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P>For in the heart of every true believer there is a heavenly tendency, a divine attraction, which as &s;en&s;ibly draws him to conver&s;e with God, as the load-&s;tone attracts the needle.</P>
<P>A deep &s;en&s;e of their own weakne&s;s, and of
<PB N="25" REF="028080_0023_0FD6966249501820">
Chri&s;t's fulne&s;s; a &s;trong conviction of their natural corruption, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of re|newing grace, will not let them <HI>re&s;t from cry|ing day and night</HI> to their Almighty Redeemer, that the divine image, which they lo&s;t in Adam, may, through his all-powerful mediation, and the &s;anctifying operations of his ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit, be begun, carried on, and fully perfected both in their &s;ouls and bodies.</P>
<P>Thus earne&s;t, thus importunate, are all &s;in|cere Chri&s;tians in praying for them&s;elves; but then, not having &s;o lively, la&s;ting, and deep a &s;en&s;e of the wants of their Chri&s;tian brethren, they are, for the mo&s;t part, too remi&s;s and de|fective in their prayers for them; whereas was the love of God &s;hed abroad in our hearts, and did we love our neighbor in that manner in which the Son of God, our Saviour loved us, and according to his command and example, we could not but be as importunate for their &s;piritual and temporal welfare, as for our own, and as earne&s;tly de&s;ire and endeavor that o|thers &s;hould &s;hare in the benefits of the death and pa&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t as we our&s;elves.</P>

<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, as he hath &s;et us an ex|ample, that we &s;hould follow his &s;teps in every thing el&s;e, &s;o hath he more e&s;pecially in this: For in that mo&s;t divine, that mo&s;t perfect and inimitable prayer, recorded in the xviith of St. John, which he put up ju&s;t before his pa&s;&s;ion, we find but few petitions for his own, though many for his di&s;ciples' welfare: And in that mo&s;t perfect form which he has been plea&s;ed to pre&s;cribe us, we are taught to &s;ay&mdash;not <HI>my,</HI> but <HI>our Father;</HI> thereby to put us in mind, that, whenever we approach the throne of grace, we ought to pray not for our&s;elves alone, but for all our brethren in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Interce&s;&s;ion then is certainly a duty incum|bent upon all Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="2">II. Whom we are to intercede for, and how this duty is to be performed, comes next to be con&s;idered, under my &s;econd general head.</P>
<P N="1">1. And fir&s;t, our interce&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be univer|&s;al. <HI>I will,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>that prayers, &s;up|plications, and interce&s;&s;ions be made for all men:</HI> For as <HI>God's mercy is over all his works,</HI> as <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t died to redeem a people out of all nations and languages;</HI> &s;o we &s;hould I pray, that <HI>all men may come to the knowledge of the truth, and be &s;aved.</HI> &mdash; Many precious promi&s;es are made in holy writ, that <HI>the go&s;pel &s;hall be publi&s;hed through the whole
<PB N="27" REF="028080_0025_0FD6966B9409C2C0">
world,</HI> that <HI>the earth &s;hall be covered with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the &s;ea:</HI> And therefore it is our duty not to confine our petitions to our own nation, but to pray that all tho&s;e nations, who now &s;it in darkne&s;s and in the &s;hadow of death, may have the glorious go&s;pel &s;hine out upon them, as well as upon us. But you need not that any man &s;hould teach you this, &s;ince ye your&s;elves are taught of God, even of Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, to pray, that his kingdom may come; part of the meaning of which petition is, that God's ways may be known upon earth, and his &s;aving health a|mong all nations.</P>
<P N="2">2. Next to the praying for all men, we &s;hould, according to St. Paul's rule, pray for tho&s;e in au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hority, that we may lead quiet lives, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty. For if we con&s;ider how heavy the burden of government is, and how much the welfare of any people depends on the zeal and godly conver&s;ation of tho&s;e that have the rule over them: If we &s;et before us the many dangers and difficulties to which gover|nors, by their &s;tation, are expo&s;ed, and the con|tinual temptations they lie under to luxury and &s;elf-indulgence, we &s;hall not only pity but pray for them&mdash;that he who pre&s;erved E&s;ther, Da|vid, and Jo&s;iah <HI>un&s;potted from the world,</HI> amid&s;t the grandeur of a court, and gave &s;ucce&s;s to their de&s;igns, would al&s;o pre&s;erve them holy and unblamable, and pro&s;per all the works of their hands upon them.</P>
<P N="3">3. But, <HI>thirdly,</HI> you ought, in a more e&s;peci|al
<PB N="28" REF="028080_0026_0FD6966D68AFC968">
manner, to pray for tho&s;e, whom <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t hath made over&s;eers over you.</HI> This is what St. Paul begs, again and again, of the churches to whom he writes. <HI>Brethren,</HI> &s;ays he in the text, <HI>pray for us;</HI> and again, in his epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians&mdash;<HI>Praying always,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>with all manner of &s;upplication; and for me al&s;o, that I may open my mouth boldly, to declare the my&s;tery of the go&s;pel.</HI> And in another place, to expre&s;s his earne&s;tne&s;s in this reque&s;t, and the great im|portance of their prayers to him, he bids the church <HI>&s;trive,</HI> or, as the original word &s;ignifies, <HI>be in an agony, together with him in their prayers.</HI> And &s;urely, if the great St. Paul, that cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el, that favorite of heaven, needed the mo&s;t importunate prayers of his Chri&s;tian converts, much more do the ordinary mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel &s;tand in need of the interce&s;&s;ion of their re&s;pective flocks.</P>
<P>And I cannot but, in a more e&s;pecial manner, in&s;i&s;t upon this branch of your duty, becau&s;e it is a matter of &s;uch importance; for, no doubt, much good is frequently with-held from many by rea&s;on of their neglecting to pray for their mini&s;ters, which they would have received, had they prayed for them as they ought. Not to mention, that people often complain of the want of diligent and faithful pa&s;tors: But how do they de&s;erve good pa&s;tors, who will not ear|ne&s;tly pray to God for &s;uch.</P>
<P>The church has &s;et apart four &s;ea&s;ons in the year for this purpo&s;e, and to call down a ble&s;&s;|ing on tho&s;e who are to be ordained to any
<PB N="29" REF="028080_0027_0FD6966E558B84A8">
holy function; but by how very few are the <HI>ember days</HI> ob&s;erved! And if we will not <HI>pray to the Lord of the harve&s;t,</HI> can it be expected, <HI>he will &s;end forth laborers into his harve&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, what ingratitude is it, not to pray for your mini&s;ters! For &s;hall they watch and labor in the word and doctrine for you, and for your &s;alvation, and &s;hall not you pray for them in return? If any be&s;tow favors on your bodies, you think it right, meet, and your bounden duty, to pray for them; and &s;hall not they be remembered in your prayers, who daily feed and nouri&s;h your &s;ouls? Add to all this, that praying for your mini&s;ters will be a manife&s;t proof of your believing, that though Paul plant and Apollos water, yet it is God alone who giv|eth the increa&s;e. And you will al&s;o find it the be&s;t means you can u&s;e, to promote your own welfare; becau&s;e God, in an&s;wer to your pray|ers, may impart a double portion of his Holy Spirit to them, whereby they will be qualified to deal out to you larger mea&s;ures of know|ledge in &s;piritual things, and be enabled more &s;kilfully to divide the word of truth.</P>
<P>Would men but con&s;tantly ob&s;erve this di|rection, and when their mini&s;ters are praying in their name to God, humbly be&s;eech him to perform all their petitions: Or, when they are &s;peaking in God's name to them, pray that <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t may fall on all them that hear the word;</HI> we &s;hall then find a more vi&s;ible good effect of their doctrine, and a greater mutual love be|tween
<PB N="30" REF="028080_0028_0FD6966FCC22F6D0">
mini&s;ters and their people. For mini&s;|ters' hands would then be held up by the peo|ple's interce&s;&s;ions, and the people will never dare to vilify or traduce tho&s;e who are the con|&s;tant &s;ubjects of their prayers.</P>

When Meriam was affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cted with a lepro&s;y from God, Mo&s;es cried and &s;aid&mdash;<HI>Lord heal her:</HI> And when the noble|man came to apply to apply to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in behalf of his child, he &s;aid&mdash; <HI>Lord, my little daughter lieth at the point of death, I pray thee come, and heal her.</HI> In like manner, when any of our friends are under any afflicting circum&s;tances, we &s;hould endeavor to pray for them, with a particular regard to tho&s;e circum&s;tances. For in&s;tance&mdash;is a friend &s;ick? We &s;hould pray, that if it be God's good plea&s;ure, it may not be unto death; but if otherwi&s;e, that he would give him grace, &s;o to take his vi&s;itation, that, after this painful life ended, he may dwell with him in life everla&s;ting. Is a friend in doubt, in a matter? We &s;hould lay his ca&s;e before God, as Mo&s;es did that of the daughters of Ze|lophehad, and pray, that God's Holy Spirit may lead him into all truth. Is he in w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt? We &s;hould pray, that his faith may never fail, and that in God's due time, he may be reliev|ed. And in all other ca&s;es, we &s;hould not pray for our friends, only in generals, but &s;uit our

difficult duty, yet not impracticable to tho&s;e who have renounced the things of this pre&s;ent life, (from an inordinate love of which alone all enmities ari&s;e) and who, knowing the terri|ble woes denounced again&s;t tho&s;e who offend Chri&s;t's little ones, can, out of real pity, and a &s;en&s;e of their danger, pray for tho&s;e by whom &s;uch offences come.</P>
<P N="6">6. La&s;tly, and to conclude this head, we &s;hould intercede for all that are any ways af|flicted in mind, body, or e&s;tate; for all who de|&s;ire, and &s;tand in need of our prayers, and for all who do not pray for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And Oh! that all who hear me, would &s;et apart &s;ome time every day for the due perform|ance of this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary duty!&mdash;In order to which,</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to the third general thing propo&s;ed, namely,</P>
<P N="3">III. To &s;hew the advantages, and offer &s;ome con&s;iderations to excite you to the practice of daily interce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> it will fill you hearts with love one to another. He that every day hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly intercedes at the throne of grace for all man|kind, cannot but in a &s;hort time be filled with love and charity to all; and the frequent exer|ci&s;e of his love in this manner, will in&s;en&s;ibly enlarge his heart, and make him partaker of that exceeding abundance of it which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord! Envy, malice, revenge and &s;uch like helli&s;h tempers, can never long harbour in a gracious interce&s;&s;or's brea&s;t; but
<PB N="33" REF="028080_0031_0FD696738CB1A628">
he will be filled with joy, peace, meekne&s;s, long-&s;uffering, and all other graces of the holy &s;pirit. By frequently laying his neighbour's wants before God, he will be touched with a fellow feeling of them; he will rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with tho&s;e that weep. Every ble&s;&s;ing be&s;towed on others, in|&s;tead of exciting envy in him, will be looked on as an an&s;wer to his particular interce&s;&s;ion, and fill his &s;oul with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory.</P>
<P>Abound therefore in acts of general and par|ticular interce&s;&s;ions, and when you hear of your neighbour's faults, in&s;tead of relating them to, and expo&s;ing them before others, lay them in &s;ecret before God, and beg of him to correct and amend them. When you hear of a noto|rious &s;inner, in&s;tead of thinking, you do well to be angry, beg of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to convert and make him a monument of his free grace; and you cannot imagine what a ble&s;&s;ed alteration this practice will make in your heart, and how much you will increa&s;e, day by day, in the &s;pi|rit of love and meekne&s;s towards all mankind!</P>
<P>But, further to excite you to the con&s;tant practice of this duty of interce&s;&s;ion, con&s;ider the many in&s;tances given us in holy &s;cripture of the power and efficacy of it. Great and ex|cellent things are there recorded as the effects of this divine employ. It has &s;topped plagues, it has opened and &s;hut heaven, and has fre|quently turned away God's fury from his peo|ple. How was Abimelech's hou&s;e freed from

the di&s;ea&s;e God &s;ent among&s;t them, at the in|terce&s;&s;ion of Abraham! When Phineas &s;tood up and prayed, how &s;oon did the plague cea&s;e!&mdash; When Daniel humbled and afflicted his &s;oul, and interceded for the Lord's inheritance, how quickly was an angel di&s;patched to tell him his prayer was heard! And to mention but one in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance more, how does God own him&s;elf, as it were, quite overcome with the importunity of Mo&s;es, when he was interceding for his ido|latrous people&mdash;<HI>Let me alone,</HI> &s;ays God!</P>
<P>This &s;ufficiently &s;hews, I could almo&s;t &s;ay, the omnipotency of interce&s;&s;ion, and how we may, like Jacob, wre&s;tle with God, and by an holy violence prevail both for our&s;elves and o|thers. And no doubt it is owing to the &s;ecret and prevailing interce&s;&s;ions of the few righte|ous &s;ouls who &s;till remain among us, that God has yet &s;pared this mi&s;erably &s;inful nation; for were there not &s;ome &s;uch faithful ones, like Mo&s;es, left to &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in the gap, we &s;hould &s;oon be de&s;troyed, even as was Sodom, and reduced to a&s;hes like unto Gomorrah.</P>
<P>But, to &s;tir you up yet farther to this God-like exerci&s;e of interce&s;&s;ion, con&s;ider that, in all probability, it is the frequent employment even of the glorified &s;aints; for though they are delivered from the burden of the fle&s;h, and re|&s;tored to the glorious liberty of the &s;ons of God, yet as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir happine&s;s cannot be perfectly con|&s;umm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted 'till the re&s;urrection of the la&s;t day, when all their brethren will be glorified with them, we cannot but think they are often im|portunate

in be&s;eeching our heavenly Father &s;hortly to accompli&s;h the number of his elect, and to ha&s;ten his kingdom. And &s;hall not we, who are on earth, be often exerci&s;ed in this di|vine employ with the glorious company of the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect? Since our happine&s;s is &s;o much to con&s;i&s;t in the commu|nion of &s;aints in the church triumphant above, &s;hall we not frequently intercede for the church militant here below, and earne&s;tly beg, that we may all be one, even as the holy Je&s;us and his Father are one, that we may al&s;o be made per|fect in one?</P>
<P>To provoke you to this great work and la|bor of love, remember that it is the never cea&s;|ing employment of the holy and highly exalt|ed Je&s;us him&s;elf, who &s;its at the right hand of God to hear all our prayers, and to make con|tinual interce&s;&s;ion for us! So that he who is con&s;tantly employed in interceding for others, is doing that on earth, which the eternal Son of God is always doing in heaven.</P>
<P>Imagine, therefore, when you are lifting up holy hands in prayer for one another, that you &s;ee the heavens opened, and the Son of God in all his glory, as the great high prie&s;t of your &s;alvation, offering up and pleading for you, the all-&s;ufficient merit of his &s;acrifice before the throne of his heavenly Father? Join then your interce&s;&s;ions with his, and be&s;eech him, that they may, through him, come up as incen&s;e, and be received as a &s;weet &s;melling &s;avour, ac|ceptable in the &s;ight of God! This imagina|tion

<P>And now, brethren, what &s;hall I &s;ay more, &s;ince you are t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ught of Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf to abound in love, and in this good work of pray|ing one for another.

<P>However, I cannot but in an e&s;pecial man|ner pre&s;s this upon you now, becau&s;e all ye, a|mong&s;t whom I have now been preaching, in all probability will &s;ee me no more; for I am now going (I tru&s;t under the conduct of God's mo&s;t holy &s;pirit) from you, knowing not what &s;hall befal me: I need therefore your mo&s;t im|portunate interce&s;&s;ions, that nothing may move me from my duty, and that I may not count even my life dear unto my&s;elf, &s;o that I may fi|ni&s;h

For it is but a little while, and we mu&s;t all appear before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t, where I mu&s;t give a &s;trict account of the doctrine I have preached, and you of your improvement under it.

<P>It is true, I have been cen&s;ured by &s;ome as acting out of &s;ini&s;ter and &s;elfi&s;h views; but it is a &s;mall matter with me to be judged by man's judgment: I hope my eye is &s;ingle, but I be|&s;eech you, brethren, by the mercies of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay that it may be more &s;o! and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with the increa&s;e of grace
