<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>THE benevolent Creator and Father of men, hav|ing given to them all an equal right to life, li|berty, and property, no Sovereign power on earth can ju&s;tly deprive them of either; but in conformity to im|partial government and laws to which they have ex|pre&s;sly or tacitly con&s;ented.</P>
<P>It is our duty, therefore, both as free Citizens and Chri&s;tians, not only to regard with compa&s;&s;ion, the in|ju&s;tice done to tho&s;e among us who are held as &s;laves; but to endeavour, by lawful ways and means, to enable them to &s;hare equally with us, in that civil and religi|ous Liberty, with which an indulgent providence has ble&s;&s;ed the&s;e States, and to which the&s;e our brethren are, by nature, as much entitled to as our&s;elves.</P>
<P>The violent attempts lately made to &s;eize and ex|port for &s;ale, &s;everal free Negroes, who were peaceably following their re&s;pective occupations, in this city mu&s;t excite the indignation of every friend to humani|ty, and ought to receive exemplary puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The hope of impunity is too often an invincible temptation to tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and as the helple&s;s con|dition of the per&s;ons alluded to, doubtle&s;s expo&s;ed them to the outrage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">y experienced, &s;o it is probable that the like circum&s;tances may again expo&s;e them and others to &s;imilar violences. De&s;titute of friends and of know|ledge, &s;truggling with poverty, and accu&s;tomed to &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, they are under great di&s;advantages in a&s;&s;erting their rights.</P>

The&s;e con&s;iderations induce us to form our&s;elves into a Society, to be &s;tiled a Society for promoting the Manumi&s;&s;ion of Slaves, and protecting &s;uch of them as have been, or may be, liberated.</P>
<P>"And that the objects of the Society may be pur|&s;ued with uniformity and propriety, we have agreed that it &s;hall be regulated by the following rules:</P></Q>
<P>I. The Society, at their next Meeting, &s;hall elect, by a majority of votes, to be taken by ballot, a Pre&s;i|den, Vice-Pre&s;ident, Secretary, and Trea&s;urer, who &s;hall re&s;pectively continue in office for one year from the time of their election, at the expiration of which time, and of every &s;ucceeding year, there &s;hall be a new elec|tion of officers in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>II. The Pre&s;ident &s;hall have authority to maintain order and decorum at the Meeting of the Society, and to call a &s;pecial Meeting at any time upon the reque&s;t, of the Standing Committee herein after-mentioned.</P>
<P>III. The Vice-Pre&s;ident, in the ab&s;ence of the Pre|&s;ident, &s;hall have the &s;ame authority given to the Pre&s;i|dent; and in ca&s;e the Pre&s;ident &s;hould die or be di&s;|placed, the Vice-Pre&s;ident &s;hall officiate till a new Pre|&s;ident be elected.</P>
<P>IV. The Secretary &s;hall keep a record of the pro|ceedings of the Society, in a book to be provided for the purpo&s;e, and &s;hall cau&s;e to be publi&s;hed, from time to time, &s;uch part of the proceedings or re&s;olutions as the Society may order, or the Pre&s;ident, with the con|&s;ent of the Standing Committee, between the Meetings of the Society, may think proper to direct.</P>
<P>V. The Trea&s;urer, if required by the Society, &s;hall give &s;ecurity for the faithful di&s;charge of the tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in him, and &s;hall keep regular accounts of the monies he has received and paid, ob&s;erving always to pay no monies without an order &s;igned by the Pre&s;i|dent, and a majority of the Standing Committee, who are prohibited from drawing, between the &s;tated Meet|ings of the Society, for a larger &s;um than <HI>Ten Pounds,</HI>

unle&s;s impowered by a &s;pecial order of the Society at a previous Meeting.</P>
<P>VI. If any of the officers above named, &s;hould die, re&s;ign, or be di&s;placed, the Society &s;hall fill the vacancy in the mode pre&s;cribed by the fir&s;t rule, and if the Pre|&s;ident and Vice-Pre&s;ident, or the Secretary, or Trea&s;urer be ab&s;ent at any of the Meetings, the Society may elect one to officiate in his room, <HI>pro tempore.</HI></P>
<P>VII. The Society &s;hall meet once in every quarter, that is to &s;ay, on the &s;econd Thur&s;day in February; on the &s;econd Thur&s;day in May; on the &s;econd Thur&s;|day in Augu&s;t, and on the &s;econd Thur&s;day in Novem|ber in every year, at &s;uch place as &s;hall from time to time be agreed upon, in order to receive the reports of the Standing Committee, and devi&s;e the ways and means of accompli&s;hing the objects of this In&s;titution.</P>
<P>VIII. That eight Members, with the Pre&s;ident or Vice-Pre&s;ident, be a quorum of the Society for tran&s;|acting bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>IX. Every Member, on &s;ub&s;cribing the&s;e rules, &s;hall pay into the hands of the Trea&s;urer, the &s;um of <HI>Eight Shillings,</HI> and the &s;um of <HI>Four Shillings</HI> at the commence|ment of each quarter, and all donations to the Society &s;hall be ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e through the Pre&s;ident, who &s;hall pay them to the Trea&s;urer, and report the &s;ame to the Society at the next quarterly Meeting.</P>
<P>X. Any per&s;on de&s;iring to be admitted a Member of this Society, &s;hall be propo&s;ed to the Society at a Quar|terly Meeting, and be ballotted for at the next Quarter|ly Meeting, and if, upon counting the ballots, two-thirds of the Members pre&s;ent &s;hall be found to be in his favour, he &s;hall be declared a Member.</P>
<P>XI. The Society &s;hall have the power of expelling any per&s;on whom they may deem unworthy of conti|nuing a Member of it.</P>
<P>XII. A Standing Committee of &s;ix Members, &s;hall be elected by ballot, at the fir&s;t Quarterly Meeting, four of the Committee &s;hall be a quorum, and it &s;hall be their duty, to carry into execution in the rece&s;s, and,

at the expence of the Society, the orders given to them by the Society, and generally to pur&s;ue &s;uch mea|&s;ures as appear to them be&s;t calculated to attain the ends of the Society. It &s;hall likewi&s;e be their duty to report their proceedings in writing at the next Quar|terly Meeting of the Society, at which time, the two fir&s;t Members of the Committee named on the Minutes, &s;hall be relea&s;ed from &s;ervice, and two other per&s;ons elected by ballot, to &s;erve in their room.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MUCH HONOURED GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS God the Great Father of the Univer&s;e, has made you the fathers of the&s;e Colonies; and in an&s;wer to the prayers of his people, given you coun&s;el, and that wi&s;dom and integrity, in the exertion of which, you have been &s;uch great and exten&s;ive ble&s;&s;ings, and ob|tained the approbation and applau&s;e of your con&s;tituents, and the re&s;pect and veneration of the nations in who&s;e &s;ight you have acted, in the important, noble &s;truggle for LIBERTY: We naturally look to you in behalf of more than half a million of per&s;ons in the&s;e Colonies, who are under &s;uch a degree of oppre&s;&s;ion and tyran|ny, as to be wholly deprived of all civil and per&s;onal liberty, to which they have as good a right as any of their fellow men, and are reduced to the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of bondage and &s;lavery, without any ju&s;t cau&s;e.</P>
<P>We have particular encouragement thus to apply to you, &s;ince you have had the honour and happine&s;s of leading the&s;e Colonies to re&s;olve to &s;top the &s;lave-trade; and to buy no more &s;laves imported from Afri|ca. We have the &s;atisfaction of the be&s;t a&s;&s;urances that you have done this not meerly from political rea|&s;ons; but from a conviction of the unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and cruelty of that trade, and a regard to ju&s;tice and bene|volence, deeply &s;en&s;ible of the incon&s;i&s;tence of promot|ing the &s;lavery of the Africans, at the &s;ame time we are a&s;&s;erting our own civil liberty, at the ri&s;que of our for|tunes and lives. This leaves in our minds no doubt of your being &s;en&s;ible of the equal unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and
<PB N="9" REF="019044_0008_0FA9AD483971C7B0">
oppre&s;&s;ion, as well as incon&s;i&s;tence with our&s;elves, in holding &s;o many hundreds of thou&s;ands of blacks in &s;la|very, who have an equal right to freedom with our|&s;elves, while we are maintaining this &s;truggle for our own and our children's liberty: and a hope and con|fidence that the cries and tears of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed will be regarded by you; and that your wi&s;dom and the great influence you have in the&s;e colonies, will be &s;o properly and effectually exerted, as to bring about a to|tal abolition of &s;lavery, in &s;uch a manner as &s;hall greatly promote the happine&s;s of tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed &s;trangers, and the be&s;t intere&s;t of the public.</P>
<P>There are many difficulties and ob&s;tacles, we are &s;en|&s;ible, in the way of this good work: But when the pro|priety, importance, and nece&s;&s;ity of it, come into view, we think our&s;elves warranted to addre&s;s you, in the words &s;poken to Ezra, on an occa&s;ion not wholly di&s;|&s;imilar. "Ari&s;e, for this matter belongeth unto you; we al&s;o will be with you: be of good courage and do it."</P>
<P>The righteous and merciful governor of the world has given the greate&s;t encouragement to go on, and tho|roughly execute judgment, and deliver the &s;poiled out of the hand of the oppre&s;&s;or, both in his word, and in the wonderful things he has done for us &s;ince we have began to reform this public iniquity. But if we &s;top here, what will be the con&s;equence!&mdash;</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that when the Swi&s;s were engaged in their &s;truggle for liberty, in which they &s;o re|markably &s;ucceeded, they entered into the following public re&s;olve: "No Swi&s;s &s;hall take away any thing by violence from another, neither in time of war, nor peace."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. ZUBLY's Short Account, P. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> How rea&s;onable and important is it that we &s;hould at this time heartily enter into, and thoroughly execute &s;uch a re&s;olution! And that this implies the emancipation of all our African &s;laves, &s;urely none can doubt.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="019044_0009_0FA9AD498D9DD700">
In this view, the following dialogue is humbly offered to your peru&s;al, hoping that it may have your approba|tion and patronage.</P>

<HEAD>A DIALOGUE, &amp;C.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A.</HI> SIR, What do you think of the motion made by &s;ome among us, to free all our <HI>African.</HI> &s;laves? They &s;ay, that our holding the&s;e blacks in &s;lavery, as we do, is an open violation of the law of God, and is &s;o great an in&s;tance of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and cruelty, that we cannot expect deliverance from pre&s;ent calamities, and &s;ucce&s;s in our &s;truggle for liberty in the <HI>American.</HI> colonies, until we repent, and make all the re&s;titution, in our power. For my part, I think they carry things much too far on this head; and if any thing might be done for the freedom of our &s;laves, this is not a proper time to attend to it, while we are in &s;uch a &s;tate of war and di&s;tre&s;s, and affairs of much greater importance de|mand all our attention, and the utmo&s;t exertion of the public.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> Sir, I am glad you have introduced this &s;ubject, e&s;pecially, as you own a number of the&s;e &s;laves; I &s;hall attend to it with plea&s;ure, and offer my &s;entiments up|on it freely, expecting you will as freely propo&s;e the ob|jections you &s;hall have again&s;t any thing I &s;hall advance. And I take leave here to ob&s;erve, that if the &s;lavery in which we hold the blacks, is wrong; it is a very great and public &s;in; and therefore a &s;in which God is now te&s;tifying again&s;t in the calamities he has brought upon us, con&s;equently mu&s;t be reformed, before we can rea|&s;onably expect deliverance, or even &s;incerely a&s;k for it. It would be wor&s;e than madne&s;s then, to put off atten|tion to this matter, under the notion of attending to more important affairs. This is acting like the mari|ner, who, when his &s;hip is filling with water, neglects to &s;top the leak or ply the pump, that he may mend his
<PB N="12" REF="019044_0011_0FA9AD4C00C82648">
&s;ails. There are at the lowe&s;t computation, 800,000. &s;laves in <HI>Briti&s;h America,</HI> including the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> i&s;lands; and a great part of the&s;e, are in the colonies on the con|tinent. And if this is in every in&s;tance wrong, un|righteou&s;ne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion; it mu&s;t be a very great and crying &s;in, there being nothing of the kind equal to it on the face of the earth. There are but few of the&s;e &s;laves, indeed in <HI>New-England,</HI> compared with the va&s;t numbers in the i&s;lands and the &s;outhern colonies; and they are treated much better on the continent, and e&s;pe|cially among us, than they are in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> But if it be all wrong, and real oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor helple&s;s blacks, we, by refu&s;ing to break this yoke, and let the&s;e injured captives go free, do practically ju&s;tify and &s;upport this &s;lavery in general, and make our&s;elves, in a mea&s;ure at lea&s;t, an&s;werable for the whole: and we have no way to exculpate our&s;elves from the guilt of the whole, and bear proper te&s;timony again&s;t this great evil, but by freeing all our &s;laves. Surely then, this matter admits of no delay; but demands our fir&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;erious attention, and &s;peedy reformation.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I acknowledge the <HI>&s;lave trade,</HI> as it has been car|ried on with the <HI>Africans,</HI> cannot be ju&s;tified. But I am not yet convinced that it is wrong to keep tho&s;e in perpetual bondage, who by this trade have been tran&s;|ported from <HI>Africa</HI> to us, and are become our &s;laves. If I viewed this in the light you do, I &s;hould agree with you that it is of the highe&s;t importance that they &s;hould all be made, free without delay; as we could not ex|pect the favour of Heaven, or with any con&s;i&s;tency a&s;k it, &s;o long as they are held in bondage.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> I am glad you have attended to the affair &s;o much as to be convinced of the unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;lave trade. Indeed, this conviction has been &s;o &s;pread of late, that it is has reached almo&s;t all men on the conti|nent, except &s;ome of tho&s;e who are too deeply intere&s;ted in it, to admit the light which condemns it. And it has now but few advocates, I believe, being generally condemned and exploded. And the members of the
<PB N="13" REF="019044_0012_0FA9AD4CB35EF870">
Continental Congre&s;s have done them&s;elves much ho|nour, in advi&s;ing the <HI>American</HI> colonies to drop this trade entirely; and re&s;olving not to buy another &s;lave, that &s;hall be imported from <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>But I think it of importance that this trade &s;hould not only be condemned as wrong, but attentively con&s;idered in its real nature, and all its &s;hocking attendants and circum&s;tances; which will lead us to think of it with a dete&s;tation and horror, which this &s;cene of inhumanity&punc; oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty, exceeding every thing of the kind that has ever been perpetrated by the &s;ons of men, is &s;uited to excite; and awaken us to a proper indigna|tion again&s;t the authors of this violence and outrage; done to their fellow men; and to feelings of humanity and pity towards our brethren, who are the mi&s;erable &s;ufferers. Therefore, though I am not able to paint this horrid &s;cene of barbarity and complicated iniquity, to the life, or even to tell the one half which may be told, in the &s;hort time allotted for this conver&s;ation; yet I will &s;ugge&s;t a few particulars; leaving you, if you plea&s;e, to con&s;ult the authors who have given a more particular de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the <HI>Africans</HI> are in a &s;tate of heatheni&s;m; and &s;unk down into that ignorance and barbarity, into which mankind naturally fall, when de&s;titute of divine revelation. Their lands are fertile, and produce all the nece&s;&s;aries of life: The inhabitants are divided into many di&s;tinct nations or clans; and of cour&s;e are fre|quently entering into quarrels, and open war with each other. The <HI>Europeans, Engli&s;h, French, Dutch,</HI> &amp;c. have carried on a trade with them for above 100 years; and have taken advantage of their ignorance and barbarity, to per&s;uade them to enter into the inhuman practice of &s;elling one another to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> for the commodi|ties which they carry to them, mo&s;t of which, they &s;tand in no real need of: but might live as well, or bet|ter without them: particularly &s;piritous liquors, which have been carried to them in great quantities by the

<HI>Americans.</HI> They, by this means, have tempted and ex|cited the poor blacks to make war upon one another, in order to get captives, &s;preading di&s;tre&s;s, deva&s;tation and de&s;truction over a va&s;t country; by which many millions have peri&s;hed: and millions of others, have been captivated, and &s;old to the <HI>Europeans and Americans,</HI> into a &s;tate of &s;lavery, much wor&s;e than death. And the inhabitants of the towns near the &s;ea, are taught to exert all the art and power they have, to entrap and de|coy one another, that they may make &s;laves of them, and &s;ell them to us for rum; by which they intoxicate them|&s;elves, and become more bruti&s;h and &s;avage than other|wi&s;e they could be, &s;o that there are but few in&s;tances of &s;obriety, hone&s;ty, or even humanity, in the&s;e towns on the &s;ea, to which the <HI>Europeans</HI> have acce&s;s: and they who live the furthe&s;t from the&s;e places, are the lea&s;t vicious, and much more civil and humane.</P>
<P>They &s;tand in no need of the rum that is carried there in &s;uch va&s;t quantities, by which &s;o many thou&s;ands have been en&s;laved, and which has &s;pread &s;uch infinite mi&s;chief among them.

We have put the bottle to our neighbours mouths, by carrying immen&s;e quantities of rum to them, and inticed them to drink, that we might take advantage of their weakne&s;s, and thereby gratify our lu&s;ts. By this means multitudes of them have been en&s;laved, and carried to the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> i&s;lands, there to be kept to hard labour, and treated ten thou&s;and times wor&s;e than dogs.

Let any one con&s;ider this, and forbear to confe&s;s, if he can, that this woe has fallen heavily upon us, and that in &s;uch a way and connection as to point out the &s;inful cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But to return. This trade has been carried on for a century and more, and for many years pa&s;t, above an hundred thou&s;and have been brought off the coa&s;t in a year, &s;o that many, many millions have been torn from their native country, their acquaintance, relations and friends, and mo&s;t of them put into a &s;tate of &s;lavery, both them&s;elves, and their children for ever, if they &s;hall have any po&s;terity, much wor&s;e than death. When numbers of the&s;e wretched creatures are collected by the &s;avages, they are brought into the public market to be &s;old, all naked as they were born. The more than &s;avage &s;lave-merchant views them, and &s;ends his &s;urgeon, more par|ticularly to examine them, as to the &s;oundne&s;s of their limbs, their age, &amp;c. All that are pa&s;&s;ed as fit for &s;ale, are branded with a hot iron in &s;ome part of their body, with the buyers mark; and then confined, crowded to|gether in &s;ome clo&s;e hold, till a convenient time to put them on board a &s;hip. When they are brought on board, all are immediately put in irons, except &s;ome of the women perhaps, and the &s;mall children, where they are &s;o crowded together in that hot climate, that com|monly a con&s;iderable number die on their pa&s;&s;age to the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> occa&s;ioned partly by their confinement, partly by the grief and vexation of their minds, from the treatment they receive, and the &s;ituation in which they find them&s;elves. And a number commonly die after they arrive at the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> in &s;ea&s;oning to the climate; &s;o that, commonly, not above &s;eventy in an hundred &s;urvive their tran&s;portation; by which means
<PB N="16" REF="019044_0015_0FA9AD53360D0940">
about thirty thou&s;and are murdered every year by this &s;lave-trade, which amounts to three millions in a cen|tury. When they are brought to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> they are again expo&s;ed to market, as if they were &s;o many bea&s;ts, and &s;old to the highe&s;t bidder; where again they are &s;eparated according to the humour of the tra|ders, without any regard to their friend&s;hips or relations, of hu&s;bands and wives, parents and children, brothers and &s;i&s;ters, &amp;c. being torn from each other, without the lea&s;t regard to any thing of this kind, and &s;ent to different places, without any pro&s;pect of &s;eeing each other again. They are then put under a ta&s;k ma&s;ter, by the purcha&s;ing planter, who appoints them their work, and rules over them with rigour and cruelty, following them with his cruel whip, or appointing one to do it, if po&s;&s;ible, more cruel than him&s;elf. The infirm and fee|ble, the females, and even tho&s;e who are pregnant, or have infants to take care of, mu&s;t do their ta&s;k in the field equally with the re&s;t; or if they fall behind, may be &s;ure to feel the la&s;h of their unmerciful driver. Their allowance of food at the &s;ame time is very coar&s;e and &s;cant, and mu&s;t be cooked by them&s;elves, if cooked at all, when they want to be a&s;leep. And often they have no food but what they procure for them&s;elves, by working on the &s;abbath; for that is the only time they have to them&s;elves. And to make any complaint, or petition for relief, will expo&s;e them to &s;ome &s;evere pu|ni&s;hment, if not a cruel death. The lea&s;t real or &s;up|po&s;eable crimes in them, are puni&s;hed in the mo&s;t cruel manner. And they have no relief; there being no ap|peal from their ma&s;ters &s;entence and will, who com|monly are more like &s;avage bea&s;ts, than rational, hu|man creatures. And to petition for liberty, though in the mo&s;t humble and mode&s;t terms, is as much as their lives are worth; as few e&s;cape the mo&s;t cruel death, who pre&s;ume to hint any thing of this kind to their ma&s;ters: It being a maxim with tho&s;e more than, cruel tyrants, that the only way to keep them under, and prevent their thinking of the &s;weets of liberty, is to pu|ni&s;h
<PB N="17" REF="019044_0016_0FA9AD54513DC9B0">
the lea&s;t intimation of it in the &s;evere&s;t manner, as the mo&s;t intolerable affront and in&s;ult on their ma&s;ters. Their labour is &s;o hard, and their diet &s;o &s;cant and poor, and they are treated in all re&s;pects with &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty, that they do not encrea&s;e by propagation in the i&s;lands, but con&s;tantly decrea&s;e, &s;o that every planter mu&s;t every year purcha&s;e five at lea&s;t to every hundred he has on his plantation, in order to keep his number from dimini&s;hing.</P>
<P>But it is in vain to attempt a full de&s;cription of the oppre&s;&s;ion and cruel treatment the&s;e poor creatures re|ceive con&s;tantly at the hands of their imperious, unmer|ciful, wor&s;e than <HI>Egyptian</HI> ta&s;k-ma&s;ters. Words cannot utter it. Volumes might be written, and not give a detail of a thou&s;andth part of the &s;hockingly cruel things they have &s;uffered, and are con&s;tantly &s;uffering. Nor can they po&s;&s;ibly be conceived of by any one, who has not been an eye witne&s;s. And how little a part does he &s;ee! They who are witne&s;&s;es to any part of this horrid &s;cene of barbarous oppre&s;&s;ion, cannot but feel the truth and propriety of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s words: "So I returned, and con&s;idered all the oppre&s;&s;ions that are done under the &s;un: and behold the tears of the oppre&s;|&s;ed, and they had no comforter; and on the &s;ide of the oppre&s;&s;ors there was power; but they had no comforter.

<P><HI>A.</HI> Sir, there is one important circum&s;tance in favour of the &s;lave-trade; or which will at lea&s;t &s;erve to coun|terballance many of the evils you mention; and that is, we bring the&s;e &s;laves from a heathen land, to places of go&s;pel light; and &s;o put them under &s;pecial advantages to be &s;aved.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> I know this has been mentioned by many in fa|vour of the &s;lave-trade: but when examined, will turn greatly again&s;t it. It can hardly be &s;aid with truth,

that the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> i&s;lands are places of go&s;pel light. But if they were, are the Negroes in the lea&s;t benefited by it? Have they any acce&s;s to the go&s;pel? Have they any in&s;truction, more than if they were bea&s;ts? So far from this, that their ma&s;ters guard again&s;t their having any in&s;truction to their utmo&s;t; and if any one would attempt any &s;uch thing, it would be at the ri&s;que of his life. And all the poor creatures learn of Chri&s;tianity, from what they &s;ee in tho&s;e who call them&s;elves Chri&s;|tians, only &s;erves to prejudice them in the highe&s;t degree again&s;t the Chri&s;tian religion.

And as to tho&s;e who are brought to the continent, in the &s;outhern colonies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It can be proved, that &s;ince the war begun, a propo&s;al was made to &s;end &s;ome blacks, who were qualified to teach Chri&s;tian|ity, into the &s;outhern colonies, to teach the blacks there, and attempt to Chri&s;tianize them: but the gentlemen who were bet|ter acquainted with the di&s;po&s;ition of &s;lave-holders, in tho&s;e parts, di&s;couraged the de&s;ign, and &s;aid the ma&s;ters of the blacks in ge|neral, would not &s;uffer any &s;uch thing!</NOTE>, and even to <HI>New-England,</HI> &s;o little pains are taken to in&s;truct them, and there is &s;o much to prejudice them again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, that it is a very great wonder, and owing to an extraordinary divine interpo&s;ition, in which we may &s;ay, God goes out of his common way, that any of them &s;hould think favourably of Chri&s;tianity, and cordially embrace it.

<P>If the <HI>Europeans</HI> and <HI>Americans</HI> had been as much en|gaged to chri&s;tianize the <HI>Africans,</HI> as they have been to en&s;lave them; and had been at half the co&s;t and pains to introduce the go&s;pel among them, that they have to captivate and de&s;troy them; we have all the rea&s;on in the world to conclude that exten&s;ive country, contain|ing &s;uch a va&s;t multitude of inhabitants, would have been full of go&s;pel light, and the many nations there, civilized and made happy; and a foundation laid for the &s;alvation of millions of millions; and the happy in|&s;truments of it have been rewarded ten thou&s;and fold for all their labour and expence.

[See <HI>A &s;hort account of that part of Africa inhabited by the Negroes,</HI> printed at Philadelphia, 1762.] And there is abun|dant evidence from hi&s;tory, and te&s;timonies inconte&s;tible, that the&s;e nations have been encouraged and induced to carry on mo&s;t of their wars, for more than a century pa&s;t, by the Europeans and Americans, that they might get captives to &s;ell to traders in the &s;ouls and bodies of men; and where this trade has been the means of &s;aving one life, it has de&s;troyed millions. Therefore, if profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, in&s;tead of encouraging them in their cru|elty, and tempting them to de&s;troy, captivate, and &s;ell each other, had taken as much pains to teach them humanity and be|nevolence, as they have to reduce millions to a &s;tate of &s;lavery wor&s;e than death; they might have &s;aved as many lives, as now they have been the means of de&s;troying.</P><P>Be&s;ides, the cruelty of tho&s;e &s;avages to each other, is no war|rant to the &s;lave trader to buy tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed victims, and put them into a &s;tate of &s;lavery, which, by their own confe&s;&s;ion, is wor&s;e than death. This, &s;urely, is not an act of mercy, but of cruelty. The voice of mercy and humanity is again&s;t &s;elling them as &s;laves. Who does not know that, "one who was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> means of pre&s;erving a man's life, is not, therefore, entituled to make him a &s;lave, and &s;ell him, as he does a piece of goods."</P><P>As to other &s;ugge&s;tions, viz. That the blacks are nece&s;&s;ary to cultivate the lands in tho&s;e hot climates, &s;ince the whites are not able to labour there, it may be ob&s;erved, <HI>that there is not the lea&s;t evidence of this, but much of the contrary.</HI> Whites are healthy, and do the labour in the Ea&s;t-Indies, which blacks do in the We&s;t, in the &s;ame climate; and that to much greater advantage, of which authentic accounts have been publi&s;hed. The truth is, mo&s;t of the whites which are born in the &s;outhern &s;tates, or the We&s;t-Indies, are not educated to labour, but, great part of them, in idlene&s;s and intemperance. The blacks are introduced to do the work, and it is thought a di&s;grace for a white per&s;on to get his living by labour. By this means, the whites in general are vicious, and all imbibe &s;uch a haughty and tyrannical &s;pirit, by holding &s;o many &s;laves, that they are above labour, and many of them, rather a plague than a ble&s;&s;ing to all about them: And whole families are ruined for ever, by means of this &s;lavery. Whereas, if African &s;laves had never been introduced, or this &s;lavery were now aboli&s;hed; and every man had his farm or plan|tation, no more than he could cultivate to the be&s;t advantage, by the help of his children, and perhaps a few hired men; this would introduce indu&s;try, temperance and oeconomy; the land would produce much more than it does now; and the country be filled with indu&s;trious, virtuous inhabitants, happy them&s;elves, and ble&s;&s;ings to all around them, in&s;tead of the comparatively few families now, many of which are a burden to the earth, and a di&s;grace to human nature.&mdash;This brings the words of Solomon fre&s;h to mind, Eccl. viii. 9. "There is a time, when one man ruleth over another <HI>to his own hurt.</HI>"</P><P>We cannot he&s;itate to &s;ay, this &s;age ob&s;ervation is verified in the mo&s;t &s;triking manner, and to the highe&s;t degree, in the &s;lavery under con&s;ideration.

<P>FIRST, If they have been brought into a &s;tate of &s;lavery, by unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and violence, they having never forfeited their liberty, or given any one a right to en&s;lave and &s;ell them; then purcha&s;ing them of the&s;e piratical tyrants, and holding them in the &s;ame &s;tate of bondage into which they, contrary to all right, have brought them, is continuing the exerci&s;e of the &s;ame unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and violence towards them. They have yet as much a right to their liberty as ever they had, and to demand it of him who holds them in bon|dage; and he denies them their right, which is of more worth to them than every thing el&s;e they can have in the world, or all the riches the unju&s;t ma&s;ter does or can po&s;&s;e&s;s; and therefore injures them in a very high de|gree every hour he refu&s;es or neglects to &s;et them at liberty. Be&s;ides,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Holding the&s;e blacks in a &s;tate of &s;lavery, is a practical ju&s;tification of the &s;lave-trade, and &s;o brings the guilt of that on the head of him, who &s;o far partakes in this iniquity, as to hold <HI>one</HI> of the&s;e a &s;lave, who was unrighteou&s;ly made &s;o by the&s;e &s;ons of vio|lence. The old addage, "The partaker is as bad as the thief," carries &s;uch a plain truth in it, that every one mu&s;t di&s;cern it: And it is certainly applicable to this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to buy one of the&s;e blacks and de|tain him a &s;lave, without partaking with him who fir&s;t reduced him to this &s;tate, and put it in his power, thus to po&s;&s;e&s;s him; and practically ju&s;tifying him for &s;o doing, &s;o as to bring upon him&s;elf the guilt of fir&s;t en|&s;laving him. It is not therefore po&s;&s;ible for any of our <HI>&s;lave keepers</HI> to ju&s;tify them&s;elves in what they are doing, unle&s;s they can ju&s;tify the &s;lave-trade. If they fall here,
<PB N="24" REF="019044_0023_0FA9AD5D92F34D98">
they bring on them&s;elves an awful degree of the guilt of the whole.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, By keeping the&s;e &s;laves, and buying and &s;elling them, they actually encourage and promote the &s;lave-trade: And therefore, in this view, keeping &s;laves, and continuing to buy and &s;ell them, is to bring on us the guilt of the &s;lave-trade, which is hereby &s;upported. For &s;o long as &s;laves are bought and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and in demand; &s;o long the <HI>African</HI> trade will be &s;upported and encouraged.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> But there is a &s;top put to the importation of &s;laves into the <HI>American</HI> Colonies, as they have re&s;olved no more &s;hall be bought. This being the ca&s;e, the keep|ing tho&s;e we have among us in &s;lavery, is no encou|ragement to the &s;lave-trade.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> I grant, if this re&s;olution &s;hould be perpetual, and extend to the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> it would di&s;courage the &s;lave-trade; &s;o far as the <HI>Americans</HI> are concerned in it: But it would be more effectually di&s;countenanced and condemned, if &s;lavery was wholly aboli&s;hed; and it can|not be con&s;i&s;tently done without this. For if it be wrong to import and buy them <HI>now,</HI> it was <HI>always</HI> wrong; and therefore they that are already &s;laves a|mong us, are injured, and unju&s;tly en&s;laved; and we have made them our &s;laves without the lea&s;t right; and ought to retract it, and repair the injury done to them, &s;o far as is in our power, by &s;etting them free, and compen&s;ating them otherwi&s;e, &s;o far as we are able. There is therefore a palpable incon&s;i&s;tency in re&s;olving to import and buy no more &s;laves; and yet refu&s;ing to let tho&s;e go out free, which we have already en&s;laved, unle&s;s there be &s;ome in&s;uperable impediment in the way.</P>
<P>The whole I have &s;aid concerning the unlawfulne&s;s of keeping the blacks in &s;lavery, if the trade by which they are become our &s;laves be unlawful, may be illu&s;|trated by the following example.</P>
<P>A number of robbers invaded a certain province, and took off mo&s;t of their goods and effects, and carried them
<PB N="25" REF="019044_0024_0FA9AD5E00ECF810">
to a neighbouring province, and &s;old them to the inha|bitants; and the robbers finding this encouragement, continued the practice for many years. At length the people of the injured province applied to their neigh|bours, who had their goods of the robbers, and were now In po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, and a&s;ked them to re&s;tore what was taken from them by violence, and to which they had a good and indi&s;putable right; it being impo&s;&s;ible the&s;e robbers could give a right to what they had unju&s;tly ta|ken from them. But the people in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the &s;tolen goods were found, utterly refu&s;ed to deliver them up to the injured people who demanded them. They told them, they had indeed been greatly injured, and they mu&s;t condemn the robbers as very injurious and cruel in what they had done: But as they now had the&s;e goods in their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they intended to keep them, and looked on them&s;elves under no obliga|tion to deliver them up, though they &s;uffered &s;o much, and would probably peri&s;h for want of them. And they intended &s;till to buy all the robbers &s;hould bring to them.</P>
<P>To this the injured replied, <Q>By partaking with the&s;e robbers in receiving the goods at their hands, you practically ju&s;tify their conduct, and mu&s;t &s;hare with them in their guilt. For by this means you en|courage them, and are determined to go on to encou|rage them in this violence and rapine: And by con|demning them, you equally condemn your&s;elves, and mu&s;t remain under this condemnation till you re&s;tore the goods we demand; and re&s;olve never to purcha&s;e any thus taken from us by violence.</Q></P>
<P>Upon this they determined to purcha&s;e no more of them, but refu&s;ed to deliver up what they had already got in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But the oppre&s;&s;ed told them, they did right in re&s;olving to injure them no more in that way; but they were now very incon&s;i&s;tent with them|&s;elves; for if it were wrong to purcha&s;e any more, it was as wrong to withhold what they had already gotten
<PB N="26" REF="019044_0025_0FA9AD5EB0B3A6C0">
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: And they had no other way to ju&s;tify them&s;elves in detaining their goods, and to be con&s;i&s;t|ent, but by proceeding to take whatever tho&s;e robbers &s;hould bring to them in future, and ju&s;tifying them|&s;elves in &s;o doing, and the robbers in all their depre|dations.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This rea&s;oning looks &s;omething plau&s;ible, I con|fe&s;s; but the holy &s;cripture approves of making and keeping &s;laves; and this &s;urely is &s;ufficient to keep us in countenance.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> I hope you will not appeal to the holy &s;cripture, in &s;upport of a practice, which you and every one el&s;e mu&s;t allow to be &s;o inexpre&s;&s;ible unju&s;t, inhuman and cruel, as is the &s;lave-trade; and con&s;equently &s;o glar|ingly contrary to the whole tenor of divine revelation. And if the &s;lave-trade is &s;uch a gro&s;s violation of every divine precept, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to vindicate the &s;lavery to which the <HI>Africans</HI> have been reduced by this trade, from the holy &s;cripture. Of this we have &s;uch a cer|tainty <HI>a priori,</HI> that would be a horrid reproach of di|vine revelation, to pretend this practice can be &s;upport|ed by that; or even to look into it with any hope or expectation of finding any thing there in favour of it. And if there be any pa&s;&s;ages in the bible, which are ca|pable of a con&s;truction in favour of this practice, we may be very certain it is a wrong one. In a word, if any kind of &s;lavery can be vindicated by the holy &s;criptures, we are already &s;ure our making and holding the Negroes our &s;laves, as we do, cannot be vindicated by any thing we can find there; but is condemned by the whole of divine revelation. However, I am wil|ling to hear what you can produce from &s;cripture, in favour of any kind of &s;lavery.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> You know that a cur&s;e was pronounced on the po&s;terity of <HI>Ham,</HI> for his wickedne&s;s, in the fol|lowing words, <HI>A &s;ervant of &s;ervants &s;hall he be unto his brethren.</HI> He could not be a &s;ervant unto his brethren, unle&s;s they made him &s;o; or at lea&s;t held him in &s;ervi|tude.
<PB N="27" REF="019044_0026_0FA9AD5FA155CC58">
The cur&s;e could not take place unle&s;s they exe|cuted it, and they &s;eem to be by God appointed to do this. Therefore while we, the children of <HI>Japheth,</HI> are making &s;uch abject &s;laves of the blacks, the children of <HI>Ham,</HI> we are only executing the righteous cur&s;e de|nounced upon them; which is &s;o far from being wrong in us, that it would be a &s;in, even di&s;obedience to the revealed will of God, to refu&s;e to make &s;laves of them, and attempt to &s;et them at liberty.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> Do you think, my good Sir, it was the duty of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> to make the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> &s;erve him and the <HI>Egyp|tians,</HI> and to afflict them, by ruling over them with ri|gour, and holding them in hard and cruel bondage, be|cau&s;e God had expre&s;sly foretold this, and &s;aid it &s;hould be done? And was the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> king blamele&s;s while he executed the judgments which God had threatened to inflict on his profe&s;&s;ing people? Did God's threaten|ing them with tho&s;e evils, warrant this king to di&s;tre&s;s, captivate and de&s;troy them, as he did? And will you &s;ay, the <HI>Jews</HI> did right in crucifying our Lord, be|cau&s;e by this they fulfilled the &s;criptures, declaring that thus it mu&s;t be!&mdash;Your argument, if it is of any force, will a&s;&s;ert and ju&s;tify all this; and therefore, I hope, will be renounced by you, and by all who have the lea&s;t regard for the holy &s;cripture, with proper ab+horrence.</P>
<P>But if this argument were not &s;o fraught with ab|&s;urdity and impiety as it really is, and it were granted to be forcible, with re&s;pect to all upon whom the men|tioned cur&s;e was denounced; yet it would not ju&s;tify our en&s;laving the <HI>Africans,</HI> for they are not the po&s;teri|ty of <HI>Canaan,</HI> who was the only &s;on of <HI>Ham</HI> that was doomed to be a &s;ervant of &s;ervants. The other &s;ons of <HI>Ham,</HI> and their po&s;terity, are no more affected with this cur&s;e, than the other &s;ons of <HI>Noah,</HI> and their po&s;te|rity. Therefore this prediction is as much of a war+rant for the <HI>Africans</HI> en&s;laving us, as it is for us to make &s;laves of them. The truth is, it gives not the lea&s;t &s;ha|dow
<PB N="28" REF="019044_0027_0FA9AD61AE2B9098">
of a right to any one of the children of <HI>Noah</HI> to make &s;laves of any of their brethren<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If it &s;hould be a&s;ked, why Canaan &s;hould be &s;ingled out from the other &s;ons of Ham, and cur&s;ed for the &s;ins of his fa|ther?

It mu&s;t be an&s;wered, No, by no means. We have no warrant to do this. The father &s;inned; and God might ju&s;tly have cur&s;ed all his po&s;terity. But in his wi&s;dom and &s;overeign goodne&s;s, he cur&s;ed only one branch of the family. And how effectually this has taken place, the &s;cripture informs us.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The people of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were allowed by God to buy and make &s;laves from the nations that were round about them, and the &s;trangers that lived among them; which could not have been the ca&s;e, if this was wrong and unju&s;t. And why have not we an equal right to do the &s;ame?</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI>&mdash;And why have not we an equal right to invade any nation and land, as they did the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and de&s;troy them all, men, women and children, and bea&s;ts, without &s;aving &s;o much as one alive? It was right for the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to do this, becau&s;e they had a divine permi&s;&s;ion and direction to do it, as the God of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had a right to de&s;troy the &s;even nations of <HI>Canaan</HI> in what way he thought be&s;t, and to direct whom he plea&s;ed to do it. And it was right for them to make bond-&s;ervants of the nations round them, they having an expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion to do it from him who has a right to di&s;po&s;e of all men as he plea&s;es. God &s;aw fit, for wi&s;e rea&s;ons, to allow the people of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> thus to make and po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;laves; but is this any licence to <HI>us</HI> to en|&s;lave any of our fellow men, any more than their be|ing allowed to kill the &s;even nations in <HI>Canaan,</HI> is a war|rant to us to kill any of our fellow men, whom we plea&s;e, and are able to de&s;troy, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates? This mu&s;t be an&s;wered in the negative, by every one who will allow him&s;elf a moment's reflection. God gave many directions and laws to the <HI>Jews,</HI> which had no re&s;pect to mankind in general; and this under
<PB N="29" REF="019044_0028_0FA9AD61D8CBA030">
con&s;ideration has all the marks of &s;uch an one. There is not any thing in it, or relating to it, from whence can be deduced the lea&s;t evidence that it was de&s;igned to be a regulation for all nations through every age of the world, but every thing to the contrary. The chil|dren of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were then di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other na|tions on earth; they were God's peculiar people, and favoured on many accounts above others; and had ma|ny things in their con&s;titution and laws that were de|&s;igned to keep up their &s;eperation and di&s;tinction from other nations, and to make the &s;pecial favour of Heaven towards them more apparent to all who had any know|ledge of them&punc; And this law re&s;pecting bondage, is &s;uited to an&s;wer the&s;e ends. This di&s;tinction is now at an end, and all nations are put upon a level; and Chri&s;t, who has taken down the wall of &s;eperation, has taught us to look on all nations as our neighbours and brethren, without any re&s;pect of per&s;ons, and to love all men as our&s;elves, and to do to others as we would they &s;hould treat us; by which he has mo&s;t effectually aboli&s;hed this permi&s;&s;ion given to the <HI>Jews,</HI> as well as many other in&s;titutions, which were peculiar to them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, that this permi&s;&s;ion was not de&s;igned for all nations and ages, will be very evident, if we con&s;ider what &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition implies: For if this be &s;o, then all other nations had a right to make &s;laves of the <HI>Jews.</HI> The <HI>Egytians</HI> had a right to buy and &s;ell them, and keep them all in bondage for ever. And the nations round about <HI>Canaan,</HI> had a right to bring them into bondage, as they &s;ometimes did. And the <HI>Babylonians</HI> and <HI>Ro|mans</HI> had a good warrant to reduce them to a &s;tate of captivity and &s;ervitude. And the <HI>Africans</HI> have a good right to make &s;laves of us and our children. The in|habitants of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> may lawfully make &s;laves of all the <HI>Americans,</HI> and tran&s;port us to <HI>England,</HI> and buy and &s;ell us in open market, as they do their cattle and hor&s;es, and perpetuate our bondage to the late&s;t gene|ration. And the <HI>Turks</HI> have a good right to all the Chri&s;tian &s;laves they have among them; and to make as
<PB N="30" REF="019044_0029_0FA9AD628BC95968">
many more &s;laves of us and our children, as &s;hall be in their power; and to hold them and their children in bondage to the late&s;t po&s;terity. According to this, every man has a warrant to make a bond &s;lave of his neigh|bour, whenever it lies in his power; and no one has any right to his own freedom, any longer than he can keep him&s;elf out of the power of others. For in&s;tance, if the blacks now among us, &s;hould by &s;ome remark|able providence have the power in their hands to re|duce us, they have a right to make us and our children, their &s;laves; and we &s;hould have no rea&s;on to complain.</P>
<P>This would put mankind into &s;uch a &s;tate of perpe|tual war and confu&s;ion, and is &s;o contrary to our lov|ing our neighbour as our&s;elves, that he who has the lea&s;t regard for his fellow men, or the divine law, mu&s;t reject it, and the principle from which it flows, with the greate&s;t abhorrence. Let no <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> then, plead this permi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Jews</HI> to make bond &s;laves of their neighbours, as a warrant to hold the &s;laves he has made, and con&s;equently for univer&s;al &s;lavery.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> But what will you do with tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages in the new te&s;tament, which are in favour of &s;lavery, and &s;up|po&s;e Chri&s;tian ma&s;ters to have Chri&s;tian &s;laves; and the ma&s;ters are &s;o far from being directed to free them, that 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed they may hold them in bondage; and their mutual duties in this relation are inculcated? <HI>Paul</HI> the Apo&s;tle is &s;o far from being di&s;po&s;ed to have &s;ervants made free, that he &s;ays, <HI>Let as many &s;ervants as are under the yoke, count their own ma&s;ters worthy of all honour</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 1.</NOTE>! And in the following words &s;uppo&s;es that <HI>believing ma&s;ters</HI> had &s;ervants, whom he exhorts to &s;erve &s;uch ma&s;ters with the more chearfulne&s;s, out of re&s;pect to their Chri&s;tian character.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> Before I make a direct an&s;wer to this, I beg leave to remind you, that whatever other kind of &s;lavery the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages will vindicate, they certainly will not &s;upport the &s;lave-trade, and that &s;lavery of the negroes into
<PB N="31" REF="019044_0030_0FA9AD65E5C07D60">
which they have been brought by this trade, which is manife&s;tly unrighteous from beginning to end; and therefore can be nothing to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, viz. to ju&s;tify Chri&s;tian ma&s;ters among us in holding the blacks and their Children in bondage.</P>
<P>I grant there are bond &s;ervants who are made &s;o, and may be held in this &s;tate, con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, hu|manity and benevolence. They are &s;uch, who have forfeited their liberty to the community of which they are members, by &s;ome particular crimes, and by debt, in &s;ome in&s;tances: and are for this condemned to &s;er|vitude for a longer or &s;horter time, and &s;old by the civil magi&s;trate. And per&s;ons may put them&s;elves into this &s;tate by their own voluntary act. There were doubtle&s;s &s;uch in the Apo&s;tle's days; and if ma&s;ter and &s;ervant, in this ca&s;e, were converted to Chri&s;tianity, the &s;ervant would &s;till be under the yoke, and the Apo&s;tle's exhor|tation highly proper. Therefore if every ma&s;ter, when he embraced Chri&s;tianity, was obliged to free all his &s;ervants who had not evidently forfeited their liberty, and not one who refu&s;ed to do this, was admitted into a Chri&s;tian church; yet there might be many ma&s;ters and &s;ervants in the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian churches: And the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture under con&s;ideration prove no more than this: And therefore will not ju&s;tify any ma&s;ter holding one &s;ervant in bondage again&s;t his will, &s;o much as an hour, who has not evidently brought him&s;elf into this &s;tate by his own crimes, and been adjudged to it, after proper trial, by the civil magi&s;trate. The&s;e &s;crip|tures therefore are infinitely far from ju&s;tifying the &s;la|very under con&s;ideration; for it cannot be made to ap|pear that one in a thou&s;and of the&s;e &s;laves has done any thing to forfeit his own liberty. And if there were any &s;uch, they have never been condemned to &s;lavery by any who are proper judges, or had any authority to act in the affair. But if this were the ca&s;e of any, they certainly could not forfeit the liberty of their children, and cau&s;e them to be born &s;laves.</P>
<P>But it may be further ob&s;erved, that it might be dif|ficult
<PB N="32" REF="019044_0031_0FA9AD66B679FFC8">
in many ca&s;es at that day, to determine what &s;ervants were ju&s;tly in a &s;tate of bondage, and who had a right to their liberty (which is not the ca&s;e with re|&s;pect to the &s;laves who&s;e cau&s;e I am now pleading). And the Apo&s;tles did not think it their bu&s;ine&s;s to ex|amine into every in&s;tance of &s;lavery, and find the ori|ginal ground of it, in order to determine, whether the &s;ervant ought to be &s;et free or not; and as it was taken for granted by all, or mo&s;t, that the &s;lavery which then took place was generally ju&s;t: And if every one who embraced Chri&s;tianity, and had &s;laves mu&s;t undergo a &s;trict examination, and be obliged to di&s;mi&s;s his &s;er|vants, unle&s;s he could produce good evidence that they had forfeited their liberty; this, as circum&s;tances then were, would have greatly prejudiced the world again&s;t the Chri&s;tian religion and tended to retard its propaga|tion: I &s;ay, con&s;idering all the&s;e things, the Apo&s;tles might be directed not to intermeddle in this affair, &s;o far as to enquire into every in&s;tance of &s;lavery, whether it was ju&s;t or not; but to treat it as if it were &s;o, unle&s;s there were particular, po&s;itive evidence of the contrary in any in&s;tances; only giving general rules for the di|rection and conduct of ma&s;ters and &s;ervants, which, if applied and put into practice, would not only render this relation comfortable, where it ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t; but would effect the liberty of all the &s;ervants, who were evidently reduced to that &s;tate unju&s;tly; and were &s;uited to put an end to &s;lavery in general.

And not only the &s;ervant is warranted and commanded to de&s;ire and &s;eek to be made free; but the ma&s;ter is al&s;o implicitly required to &s;et him at liberty, if there be no in&s;uperable impedi|ment in the way; for if the &s;ervant ought to de&s;ire and attempt to obtain his freedom, the ma&s;ter ought to de&s;ire it al&s;o, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him to obtain it, if it can be effected; and will do it, if he loves his &s;ervant, as him&s;elf: And the church to which the &s;ervant belongs, and every member of it, ought to do all in their power to procure the freedom of every &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch &s;ervant; for will any one &s;ay they ought not to do their utmo&s;t in a&s;&s;i&s;ting their poor &s;uffering brother to obtain his liberty, which God has commanded him to de&s;ire and &s;eek? This Apo&s;tolic command therefore, being properly regarded, would &s;oon put an end to mo&s;t in&s;tances of &s;lavery in the Chri&s;|tian church, if it did not wholly aboli&s;h it; e&s;pecially at this day, when many of the impediments in the way of freeing &s;laves, which were in the Apo&s;tles days, are removed. And it may be left to the con&s;ciences of all &s;lave holders among us, whether, if it had been left to them, &s;uch a direction and command would ever have been given to any &s;ervant whatever, as is here given by the Apo&s;tle; and whether, now it is given, they ap|prove of it, and practice accordingly. So far from it, that mo&s;t of them, even profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, hold their &s;ervants at &s;uch a di&s;tance, and treat them in &s;uch a man|ner, that the poor &s;ervant dare not &s;o much as treat with his ma&s;ter about his freedom; and if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould &s;ay a word, is pretty &s;ure to receive nothing but angry frowns, if not blows.

And is there one church now in this land, who are ready to do what is in their power to obtain the freedom of the &s;laves which belong to them; or are willing calmly to con&s;ider and debate the que&s;tion among them&s;elves, whether it be right to hold the Negroes in bondage? Where is the church that has done any thing of this kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the fir&s;t edition of this Dialogue, a number of Churches in New-England, have purged them&s;elves from this iniquity, and determined not to tolerate the holding of the Africans in &s;lavery.

<P>But to return. The Apo&s;tle &s;eems to have conducted in this ca&s;e, as he did in that of civil government. He con&s;idered this as a divine in&s;titution, and pointed out the end and de&s;ign of it, and the duty of civil rulers, and of the &s;ubject, without particularly applying it to the government Chri&s;tians were then under, &s;o as ex|pre&s;sly to ju&s;tify or condemn the particular form of government that then took place; or the conduct of tho&s;e who then had the civil authority in their hands; and that for very obvious rea&s;ons, grounded on the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of the Church and of public affairs at that day. We may as well infer from this, that the civil governors of that day were not unju&s;t and tyran|nical, which is mo&s;t contrary to known fact, as we can, that the &s;lavery which then took place was in general ju&s;t and right, from his pointing out the duties of ma&s;|ters and &s;ervants, without mentioning and condemning any particular in&s;tances of unju&s;t &s;lavery.</P>

<HI>A.</HI> You well ob&s;erved that the apo&s;tles did not inter|meddle with the affair of &s;lavery, &s;o as to condemn ma&s;ters for holding their &s;laves; or tell the &s;ervants their ma&s;ters had no right to keep them in bondage; but ought to free them, &amp;c. I wi&s;h all were as wi&s;e and prudent now; e&s;pecially mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel: But all are not &s;o. Many make &s;uch a clamour about holding our Negroes in bondage; and &s;ome mini&s;ters have of late &s;aid &s;o much in public about freeing our &s;laves; and have &s;o inveighed again&s;t the <HI>African</HI> &s;lave-trade, and even keeping our blacks in &s;lavery, that ma|ny of the negroes are become very unea&s;y, and are much more engaged to obtain their liberty than they u&s;ed to be.</P>
<P>I think, if any thing be &s;aid on this &s;ubject, it &s;hould be in private; and not a word of this kind &s;hould be li&s;ped in the hearing of our &s;ervants; much le&s;s ought mini&s;ters to &s;ay any thing about it in public; le&s;t the blacks &s;hould all take it into their heads that they are treated hardly, and never be ea&s;y till they are &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI>&mdash;It has been ob&s;erved, there were rea&s;ons, pecu|liar to the &s;tate of things at that time, why the apo&s;tles &s;hould not be &s;o particular on this head: which rea&s;ons do not take place now. The &s;lavery that now takes place is in a Chri&s;tian land, and without the expre&s;s &s;anction of civil government: And it is all of the &s;ame kind, and from one original; which is mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly unju&s;t; and if it be unrighteous in one in&s;tance, it is &s;o in almo&s;t every in&s;tance; and the unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of it is mo&s;t apparent, and mo&s;t ma&s;ters have no colour of claim to hold their &s;ervants in bondage. And this is become a general and crying &s;in; for which we are under the awful frowns of Heaven. The&s;e things, which make the ca&s;e &s;o different from the &s;lavery which took place in the apo&s;tles days may be a good rea&s;on of a different conduct; and make it duty to oppo&s;e, and bear te&s;ti|mony, both in public, and more privately, again&s;t this

evil practice, which is &s;o evidently injurious to indivi|duals, and threatens our ruin as a people.</P>
<P>As to making &s;ervants unea&s;y, and de&s;irous of liberty, &amp;c. I would ob&s;erve, that mo&s;t of them do not want to be informed that they are greatly injured and oppre&s;|&s;ed; that they are reduced to a &s;tate of &s;lavery, without the lea&s;t colour of ju&s;tice. They have &s;en&s;e and di&s;cerning enough to be &s;en&s;ible of this, without being told; and they think much of it almo&s;t every day, though they are obliged to keep it to them&s;elves, having none to pity them, or &s;o much as hear their complaints. They have a thou&s;and times more di&s;cerning and &s;en&s;ibility in this ca&s;e than their ma&s;ters, or mo&s;t others. And their aver|&s;ion to &s;lavery, and de&s;ires of liberty, are inextingui&s;ha|ble. Therefore their hearing it a&s;&s;erted that they ought to be &s;et at liberty, gives them no new light and conviction, except it be, that he who a&s;&s;erts it, has &s;ome di&s;cerning of what they have long known, and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt; and has courage enough to a&s;&s;ert that in their favour, which they have long felt the truth of; but dared not &s;o much as li&s;p it out.&mdash;But if by this means any of your &s;ervants &s;hould be more fully con|vinced of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight to liberty, and the inju&s;tice done them in making them &s;laves, will this be &s;uch a dread|ful evil? Would you de&s;ire they &s;hould be held in ig|norance, that you may exerci&s;e your tyranny, without oppo&s;ition or trouble from any quarter? As rea&s;ona|bly might <HI>Pharaoh</HI> be angry, and complain of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> for &s;aying a word to tho&s;e whom he had re|duced to &s;lavery, about their cruel bondage, and their obtaining their liberty.</P>
<P>It has always been the way of tyrants to take great pains to keep their va&s;&s;als in ignorance, e&s;pecially to hide from them the tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion of which they are the &s;ubjects.

This, I &s;ay, nece&s;&s;arily leads them to attend to their own wretched &s;ituation, more than otherwi&s;e they could. They &s;ee them&s;elves deprived of all liberty and property, and their children after them, to the late&s;t po&s;terity, &s;ubjected to the will of tho&s;e who appear to have no feeling for their mi&s;ery, and are guilty of many in|&s;tances of hard heartedne&s;s and cruelty towards them, while they think them&s;elves very kind; and therefore to make the lea&s;t complaint, would be deemed the height of arrogance and abu&s;e: And often, if they have a comparatively good ma&s;ter now, with con&s;tant dread they &s;ee a young one growing up, who bids fair to rule over them, or their children, with rigour.</P>

The more and greater the&s;e are, the more zealous and active &s;hould we be in removing them.

<P>No wonder there are many and great difficulties in reforming an evil practice of this kind, which has got &s;uch deep root by length of time, and is become &s;o common. But it does not yet appear that they cannot be removed, by the united wi&s;dom and &s;trength of the <HI>American</HI> colonies, without any injury to the &s;laves, or di&s;advantage to the public. Yea, the contrary is mo&s;t certain, as the &s;laves cannot be put into a more wretched &s;ituation, our&s;elves being judges, and the community cannot take a more likely &s;tep to e&s;cape ruin, and ob|tain the &s;miles and protection of Heaven. This matter ought doubtle&s;s to be attended to by the General A&s;&s;em|blies, and Continental and Provincial Congre&s;&s;es; and if they were as much united and engaged in devi&s;ing ways and means to &s;et at liberty the&s;e injured &s;laves, as they are to defend them&s;elves from tyranny, it would &s;oon be effected.

<P>And how great mu&s;t have been the impediments, how many the &s;eeming unan&s;werable objections, again&s;t reforming that gro&s;s violation of the divine command in <HI>Ezra'</HI>s time, by their marrying &s;trange wives, of which &s;o many of the <HI>Jews</HI> were guilty, and the hand of the princes and rulers had been chief in this tre&s;pa&s;s! Yet the pious zeal of <HI>Ezra</HI> and tho&s;e who joined with him, and their wi&s;dom and indefatigable efforts conquered every ob&s;tacle, and brought them to a thorough refor|mation. Would not the like zeal, wi&s;dom and re&s;o|lution, think you, &s;oon produce a reformation of this much greater abomination, by finding out an effectual method to put away all our &s;laves?

<P>Some ma&s;ters &s;ay, they will give up their &s;laves, if all ma&s;ters will do the &s;ame; but &s;eem to think they are excu&s;ed from &s;etting their's free, &s;o long as there is not a general manumi&s;&s;ion. What has ju&s;t been ob&s;erved is &s;uited, I think, to &s;hew the in&s;ufficiency of this ex|cu&s;e. Be&s;ides, if you de&s;ire to have all our &s;laves freed, why do you not &s;et an example, by liberating your own? This might influence others to do the &s;ame; and then you might, with a good grace, plead the cau&s;e of the&s;e poor <HI>Africans.</HI> Whereas, while you retain your own &s;laves, your mouth is &s;topped, and your example &s;erves to &s;trengthen others, and keep them in coun|tenance, while they practi&s;e this abominable oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> My &s;ervants have co&s;t me a great deal of money, and it is not rea&s;onable I &s;hould lo&s;e all that. If the public will indemnify me, and pay me what my &s;er|vants are worth, I am willing to free them; and none can rea&s;onably de&s;ire to do it, on any other con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> If your neighbour buys a hor&s;e, or any bea&s;t, of
<PB N="44" REF="019044_0043_0FA9AD7781A4D278">
a thief who &s;tole it from you, while he had no thought that it was &s;tolen, would you not think you had a right to demand your hor&s;e of your neighbour, and pronounce him very unju&s;t, if he &s;hould refu&s;e to deliver him to you, till he had received the whole &s;um he had given for him? And have not your &s;ervants as great a right to them&s;elves, to their liberty, as you have to your &s;tolen hor&s;e? They have been &s;tolen and &s;old, and you have bought them, in your own wrong, when you had much more rea&s;on to think they were &s;tolen, than he who bought your hor&s;e had to mi&s;tru&s;t he was trading with a thief. Though your hor&s;e has pa&s;&s;ed through many hands, and been &s;old ten times, you think you have a right to demand and take him, in who&s;e &s;oever hands you find him, without refunding a farthing of what he co&s;t him; and yet, though your Negroes can prove their right to them&s;elves, and con&s;tantly make a demand up|on you to deliver them up, you refu&s;e till they pay the full price you gave for them, becau&s;e the civil law will not oblige you to do it.&mdash;<HI>Thou Hypocrite!&mdash;Luke</HI> xiii. 15.</P>
<P>Had you not been amazingly incon&s;iderate and &s;tupid, you would have concluded the&s;e men were &s;tolen; and <HI>known</HI> that no man had a right to &s;ell them, or you to buy them And mu&s;t they be for ever deprived of their right, which is worth more to them, than all you po&s;|&s;e&s;s, becau&s;e you have been &s;o fooli&s;h and wicked as to buy them, and no one appears to prevent your lo&s;ing by the bargain! You would do well to con&s;ider the aw|ful denunciation by <HI>Jeremiah. Woe unto him that buildeth his hou&s;e by unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and his chambers by wrong; that u&s;eth his neighbour's &s;ervice without wages, and giveth him not for his work!</HI> He who refu&s;es to free his Negroes, that he may &s;ave his money, and lay it up for his children, and retains his &s;laves for them to ty|rannize over, leaves them but a mi&s;erable inheritance&mdash;infinitely wor&s;e than nothing!</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if indifferent per&s;ons were to judge, it would doubtle&s;s be found that many of your &s;ervants, if not
<PB N="45" REF="019044_0044_0FA9AD78726D6C80">
all, have much more than earned what they co&s;t you; &s;ome of them double and treble, yea, ten times as much; and in this view, you ought to let them go out free; and not &s;end them away empty; but furni&s;h them liberally out of your &s;tore, agreeable to the divine command; they having a much better right to part of your e&s;tate, than your children, and, it may be, much more likely to make a good improvement of it.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> You &s;peak of &s;ervants earning &s;o much; but for my part, I think not &s;o much of this. Mine have ne|ver been much profit to me, and mo&s;t of them do not pay for their victuals and cloaths, but are con&s;tantly running in debt.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> The ma&s;ter is not a proper judge in this ca&s;e. How common is it for men who hire others, to complain that the labourers do not earn the wages they give; and that they are continually lo&s;ing by all the labour they hire? And if it were wholly left to him who hires what wages he &s;hould give the labourer, and he was ac|countable to none, how &s;oon would his hire be reduced to little or nothing. The lordly &s;elfi&s;h employer would &s;oon find out that his labourers hardly earned the food he was obliged to find them. Let your unintere&s;ted, ju|dicious neighbours, judge between you and your &s;er|vants in this matter, and we will give credit to their verdict. And &s;urely you have no rea&s;on to expect we will rely on yours, as you &s;eem not really to believe it your&s;elf, &s;ince it looks like a contradiction to your own declaration and practice. For you have been &s;peaking of your &s;ervants as of as much worth to you, at lea&s;t, as their fir&s;t co&s;t, and repre&s;ented it as giving up your in|tere&s;t, if you &s;hould free them without a compen&s;ation. Whereas, if what you now &s;ay be true, you will lo&s;e nothing by freeing them immediately; but rather get rid of a burden now on your hands. And if this be true, why do you not free them without delay? Your holding them in &s;lavery, is a practical contradiction to what you have now &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>I grant, what is evident to all the di&s;cerning who at|tend
<PB N="46" REF="019044_0045_0FA9AD78F9DF8570">
to it, that the introduction of &s;uch a number of &s;laves among us is a public detriment, an injury to the commonwealth; and therefore, in this view, the prac|tice ought by all means to be di&s;couraged and aboli&s;hed by our legi&s;lators: This, however, is con&s;i&s;tent with in|dividuals getting e&s;tates by the labour of their &s;laves; and that they are in fact, in many in&s;tances, very pro|fitable to their owners, none can deny. And if this was not &s;o, I &s;hould be very certain of obtaining what I am pleading for, even a general manumi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> You have repeatedly &s;poke of our &s;laves being hardly treated and abu&s;ed. There may perhaps be &s;ome in&s;tances of this among us; but I believe they are generally treated very well, and many of them much better than they de&s;erve. My &s;ervants, I am &s;ure, have no rea&s;on to complain; they live as well as I do my&s;elf, and in many re&s;pects much better.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> We will take it for granted, for once, that all you have &s;aid is true; and that your &s;laves are treated as well as they can be, while they are held in a &s;tate of &s;lavery. But will this atone for your making them your &s;laves, and taking from them that which it better to them than not only the be&s;t living, but all the riches on earth, and is as much to be prized as life it&s;elf, THEIR LI|BERTY? As well, yea, with much more rea&s;on, may a highway-robber, tell a gentlemen from whom he has taken all his money, he has no rea&s;on to complain, &s;ince he had &s;pared his life, which was at his mercy, nor had wounded him, or &s;tripped him of his cloaths; and go away plea&s;ed with the thought that he had treated him with great kindne&s;s and genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>If a ruffian &s;hould &s;eize, ravi&s;h and carry off a young virgin from all her relations and friends, into &s;ome lone|ly cave in the wilderne&s;s; and when he got full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her there, &s;hould treat her with great kindne&s;s providing for her every nece&s;&s;ary and comfort &s;he could have in that &s;ituation. And when he was told of his violence and cruelty, and urged to re&s;tore her to her former liberty; he &s;hould refu&s;e to relea&s;e her, and to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, alledge his kind treatment of her, that

&s;he had all the comforts of life, and lived better than him&s;elf, &amp;c. Would not this be &s;o far from ju&s;tifying him in the &s;ight of the world, or being the lea&s;t excu&s;e for his barbarous treatment of her, that his offering it as &s;uch, would be con&s;idered as a &s;triking evidence of his &s;tupidity, and that he was an unfeeling, inhumane wretch? Whether &s;uch an in&s;tance is in any mea&s;ure applicable to the ca&s;e before us, I leave you to judge.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t now a&s;k leave to take back, what was ju&s;t now granted; and ob&s;erve, that you are not a proper judge of your treatment of your &s;laves; and that you may think you treat them very well, in &s;ome in&s;tances at lea&s;t, if not in a con&s;tant way, they ju&s;tly think them|&s;elves u&s;ed very hardly, being really &s;ubjected to many hard&s;hips, which you would very &s;en&s;ibly feel and re|&s;ent, if you were in their place, or &s;hould &s;ee one of your children a &s;lave in <HI>Algiers</HI> treated &s;o by his ma&s;ter. There are but few ma&s;ters of &s;laves, I believe, who do not u&s;e them in a hard, unrea&s;onable manner, in &s;ome in&s;tances at lea&s;t; and mo&s;t do &s;o in a con&s;tant way; &s;o that an impartial, attentive by-&s;tander will be &s;hock|ed with it, while the ma&s;ter is wholly in&s;en&s;ible of any wrong. They who from us have vi&s;ited the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> have beheld how &s;ervants are u&s;ed by their ma&s;ters there, with a degree of horror, and pronounced them very unrea&s;onable and barbarous; while the ma&s;ter, and perhaps his other dome&s;tics have thought they were u&s;ed well, being accu&s;tomed to &s;uch u&s;age, and never once reflecting that the&s;e blacks were in any &s;en&s;e on a level with them&s;elves, or that they have the lea&s;t right to the treatment white people may rea&s;onably ex|pect of one another; and being habituated to view the&s;e &s;laves more beneath them&s;elves, than the very bea&s;ts really are. And are we not, mo&s;t of us, educated in the&s;e prejudices, and led to view the &s;laves among us, in &s;uch a mean de&s;picable light, as not to be &s;en&s;ible of the abu&s;es they &s;uffer; when, if we or our children &s;hould receive &s;uch treatment, from any of our fellow men, it, would appear terrible in our fight? The <HI>Turks</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="019044_0047_0FA9AD7B5C954A90">
are by education and cu&s;tom, taught to view the Chri&s;|tian &s;laves among them &s;o much beneath them&s;elves, and in &s;uch an odious light, that while they are treating our brethren and children, we being judges, in the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and cruel manner, they have not one thought that they injure them in the lea&s;t degree.</P>
<P>Are you &s;ure your &s;laves have a &s;ufficiency of good food, in &s;ea&s;on; and that they never want for comfort|able cloathing and bedding? Do you take great care to deal as well by them in the&s;e things, as you would wi&s;h others would treat your own children, were they &s;laves in a &s;trange land? If your &s;ervants complain, are you ready to attend to them? Or do you in &s;uch ca&s;es frown upon them, or do &s;omething wor&s;e, &s;o as to di&s;courage their ever applying to you, whatever they may &s;uffer, having learned that this would only be making bad wor&s;e? Do you never fly into a pa&s;&s;ion, and deal with them in great anger, deciding matters re&s;pecting them, and threatening them, and giving &s;entence concerning them, from which they have no appeal, and perhaps proceed to correct them, when to a calm by-&s;tander you appear more fit to be confined in Bedlam, than to have the &s;overeign, uncontroulable dominion over your brethren, as the &s;ole lawgiver, judge, and executioner? Do not even your children domineer over your &s;laves? Mu&s;t they not often be at the beck of an ungoverned, peevi&s;h child in the family; and if they do not run at his or her call, and are not all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience, mu&s;t they not expect the frowns of their ma&s;ters, if not the whip?</P>
<P>If none of the&s;e things, my good Sir, take place in your family, have we not rea&s;on to think you almo&s;t a &s;ingular in&s;tance? How common are things of this kind, or wor&s;e, taking place between ma&s;ters and their &s;laves? In how few in&s;tances, if in any, are &s;laves treated as the ma&s;ters would wi&s;h to have their own chil|dren treated, in like circum&s;tances? How few are fit to be ma&s;ters? To have the &s;overeign dominion over a number of their fellow men, being his property, and
<PB N="49" REF="019044_0048_0FA9AD7C293D7EC0">
wholly at his di&s;po&s;al; who mu&s;t abide his &s;entence and orders, however unrea&s;onable, without any po&s;&s;ibility of relief?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I believe my &s;laves are &s;o far from thinking them|&s;elves abu&s;ed, or being in the lea&s;t unea&s;y in a &s;tate of &s;lavery, that they have no de&s;ire to be made free; and if their freedom were offered to them, they would re|fu&s;e to accept it.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> I mu&s;t take leave to call this in que&s;tion, Sir; and I think you believe it, in contradiction to all rea|&s;on, and the &s;tronge&s;t feelings of human nature, till they have declared it them&s;elves, having had opportunity for due deliberation, and being in circum&s;tances to act freely, without the lea&s;t con&s;traint, or fear.</P>
<P>There are many ma&s;ters (if we believe what they &s;ay) who plea&s;e them&s;elves with this fond opinion of their goodne&s;s to their &s;laves; and their choice of a &s;tate of &s;lavery, in preference to freedom, without the lea&s;t foundation, and while the contrary is known to be true by all who are acquainted with their &s;laves. If they really believe this, they by it only di&s;cover great in&s;en|&s;ibility, and want of proper reflection. They have not &s;o much as put them&s;elves in the place of their &s;laves, &s;o as properly and with due &s;en&s;ibility to con&s;ult what would be their own feelings, on &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition. Have they them&s;elves lo&s;t all de&s;ire of freedom? Are they de&s;titute of all ta&s;te of the &s;weets of it; and have they no aver&s;ion to &s;lavery, for them&s;elves and children? If they have the&s;e feelings, what rea&s;on have they to conclude their &s;ervants have not?</P>
<P>But it &s;eems mo&s;t of tho&s;e ma&s;ters do not fully be|lieve what they &s;o often &s;ay on this head: For they have never made the trial; nor can they be per&s;uaded to do it. Let them offer freedom to their &s;ervants: and give them opportunity to choo&s;e for them&s;elves, without be|ing under the mo&s;t di&s;tant con&s;traint. And if they then deliberately choo&s;e to continue their &s;laves, the matter
<PB N="50" REF="019044_0049_0FA9AD7CB56FBBB8">
will be fairly decided, and they may continue to po&s;&s;e&s;s them with a good con&s;cience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But this will give them no right to make &s;laves of their chil|dren, even if the parents them&s;elves &s;hould expre&s;sly con&s;ent to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; for the parent can have no right to &s;ell the liberty of his children.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Slaves are generally under &s;uch di&s;advantages and re|&s;traints, that however much they de&s;ire liberty, they dare not &s;o much as mention it to their ma&s;ters. And if their ma&s;ter &s;hould order them into his pre&s;ence, and a&s;k them whether they had a de&s;ire to be made free, many would not dare to declare their choice, le&s;t it &s;hould offend him, and in&s;tead of obtaining their freedom, bring them&s;elves into a more evil ca&s;e than they were in before, as the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did, by de&s;iring <HI>Pharoah</HI> to free them.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e &s;uch precaution ought to be taken, as to give the &s;laves proper a&s;&s;urance that they may without any danger to them&s;elves, declare their choice of free|dom: and that it &s;hall be done to them according to their choice.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> If &s;laves in general were made free, they would &s;oon be in a wor&s;e &s;tate than that in which they now are. Many of them know not how to contrive for them&s;elves, &s;o as to get a living; but mu&s;t &s;oon be maintained by their former ma&s;ters, or &s;ome others: And others would make them&s;elves wretched, and become a great trouble to their neighbours, and an injury to the public, by their unre&s;trained vices. This would doubtle&s;s be the ca&s;e with mo&s;t of mine, were they &s;et free; and &s;ome of them are by no means able to maintain them|&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> I confe&s;s this objection, at fir&s;t view, &s;eems to have &s;ome weight in it. But let us examine it, and &s;ee if it be &s;ufficient to hold &s;o many thou&s;ands in &s;lavery, and their children after them, to the end of the world. Would you have all the white people, who are given to hurtful vices, or are unwilling or unable to maintain them&s;elves, made &s;laves, and their children after them, and be bought and &s;old for life like cattle in the market?
<PB N="51" REF="019044_0050_0FA9AD7FEE907C88">
Would you willingly give up your own children to this, to be &s;laves for ever to any one who &s;hould be willing and able to purcha&s;e them, if they were as vicious, or helple&s;s as you &s;uppo&s;e many of the blacks would be if &s;et at liberty? I am &s;ure you will not an&s;wer in the af|firmative. And by an&s;wering in the negative, as I know you mu&s;t, you will entirely remove the rea&s;on you have now offered for holding the blacks in this &s;la|very; till you can &s;hew why the latter &s;hould be treat|ed &s;o very differently from the former, which I am con|fident you will not attempt.</P>
<P>A &s;tate of &s;lavery has a mighty tendency to &s;ink and contract the minds of men, and prevent their making improvements in u&s;eful knowledge of every kind: It &s;inks the mind down in darkne&s;s and de&s;pair; it takes off encouragements to activity, and to make improve|ments, and naturally tends to lead the en&s;laved to aban|don them&s;elves to a &s;tupid carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and to vices of all kinds. No wonder then the blacks among us are, many of them, &s;o de&s;titute of prudence and &s;agacity to act for them&s;elves; and &s;ome are given to vice. It is rather a wonder, there are &s;o many in&s;tances of virtue, prudence, knowledge and indu&s;try among them. And &s;hall we, becau&s;e we have reduced them to this abject, helple&s;s, mi&s;erable &s;tate, by our oppre&s;&s;ion of them, make this an argument for continuing them and their children in this wretched condition! God forbid! This ought rather to excite our pity, and arou&s;e us to take &s;ome effectual method without delay, to deliver them and their children from this mo&s;t unhappy &s;tate. If your own children were in this &s;ituation, would you offer this as a good rea&s;on why they and their po&s;terity &s;hould be made &s;laves for ever? Were &s;ome of your children unable to provide for them&s;elves through infir|mity of body, or want of mental capacity; and others of them were very vicious, would you have them &s;old into a &s;tate of &s;lavery for this? or would you make &s;laves of them your&s;elf? Would you not be willing to take the be&s;t care of them in your power, and give them
<PB N="52" REF="019044_0051_0FA9AD8207885458">
all po&s;&s;ible encouragement to behave well; and direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in proper methods to get a living? I know you would. And why will you not go and do likewi&s;e to your &s;laves? Why will you not take off the galling yoke from their necks, and re&s;tore them to that liberty, to which they have as good a claim as you your&s;elf and your children; and which has been violently taken from them, and unju&s;tly withheld by you to this day? If any of them are di&s;po&s;ed to behave ill, and make a bad u&s;e of their freedom, let them have all the motives to behave well that can be laid before them. Let them be &s;ubject to the &s;ame re&s;traints and laws with other freemen; and have the &s;ame care taken of them by the public. And be as ready to di|rect and a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who want di&s;cretion and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to get a living, as if they were your own children; and as willing to &s;upport the helple&s;s, infirm and aged. And give all proper encouragement and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to tho&s;e who have &s;erved you well, and are like to get a good living, if not put under peculiar di&s;advantages, as freed negroes mo&s;t commonly are; by giving them rea|&s;onable wages for their labour, if they &s;till continue with you, or liberally furni&s;hing them with what is nece&s;&s;ary in order to their living comfortably, and being in a way to provide for them&s;elves. This was the di|vine command to the people of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> and does it not appear, at lea&s;t, equally rea&s;onable, in the ca&s;e before us? When one of their brethren had &s;erved them the number of years that were &s;pecified, they were com|manded to let him go out free; and then the following injunction is added: <HI>And when thou &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">de&s;t him out free from thee, thou &s;halt not let him go away empty: Thou &s;halt furni&s;h him liberally out of thy f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy wine pre&s;s: Of that wherewith the LORD thy GOD hath ble&s;&s;ed thee, thou &s;halt give unto him,</HI> Deut. xv. 13, 14.</P>

near relations &s;hould be treated, our &s;laves might all be &s;et free, without any detriment to them&s;elves or the public; and their ma&s;ters would be &s;o far from lo&s;ing by it, that they would be abundantly rewarded for all their benevolence to the&s;e injured poor. And if our legi&s;lators would lend their helping hand, and form &s;uch laws and regulations, as &s;hall be properly &s;uited to protect and a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e that are freed, and &s;o as in the be&s;t manner to deter and re&s;train them from vi|cious cour&s;es, and encourage their indu&s;try and good behaviour; this would be an additional &s;ecurity to the public again&s;t any imagined evil con&s;equence of a gene|ral manumi&s;&s;ion of our &s;laves; and but a piece of ju&s;tice to the&s;e poor dependent creatures, whom we have made &s;o by our own unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion. This would encourage ma&s;ters to free their &s;laves, and leave the objection we are now con&s;idering without the lea&s;t &s;hadow of foundation.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> You are doubtle&s;s &s;en&s;ible, Sir, that the legi&s;la|tures in the&s;e colonies, are &s;o far from giving this en|couragement to manumit our &s;laves, that the laws are rather a clog or hindrance to any thing of this kind, as they require the ma&s;ter to give &s;ecurity for the mainte|nance of his &s;laves, if they &s;hould ever want any a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, before he is allowed to make them free.</P>

<P>But if this &s;hould not be, I think it appears from the cour&s;e of this conver&s;ation, that this will not excu&s;e tho&s;e who have &s;laves from &s;etting them at liberty, even though they &s;hould be obliged to maintain them all their days.

in bondage with a quiet con&s;cience. Otherwi&s;e, I &s;ee not how he can do it.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> If it were granted that our &s;laves ought to be freed, if times and the public &s;tate of the <HI>American</HI> co|lonies would admit. Yet in our pre&s;ent peculiar, cala|mitous, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;tate, it may be very imprudent and wrong, and tend to great evil to adopt this mea&s;ure. Mo&s;t of the &s;laves in populous &s;ea-port places, have now little or no bu&s;ine&s;s to do; and are &s;upported by their ma&s;ters, while they earn little or nothing. And if they &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by their ma&s;ters, they could not maintain them&s;elves, and mu&s;t &s;uffer. And the attention and exertion of the public is &s;o nece&s;&s;arily turned to the defence of our&s;elves; and this civil war introduces &s;uch calamity and confu&s;ion, that it cannot be expected; yea 'tis quite impo&s;&s;ible, that there &s;hould be any proper care of the public, &s;o as to make the pro|vi&s;ion and regulations which would be ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary in this ca&s;e. Though I &s;ugge&s;ted this in the beginning of our conver&s;ation, yet I think you have paid little or no attention to it. I wi&s;h this might be well con&s;idered.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> I think the facts you have now alledged, as rea|&s;ons again&s;t freeing our &s;laves at pre&s;ent, will, if duly con&s;idered, afford arguments for the very thing you are oppo&s;ing. The &s;laves who are become unprofitable to their ma&s;ters, by the pre&s;ent calamitous &s;tate of our country, will be with the le&s;s reluctance &s;et at liberty, it is hoped; and if no public provi&s;ion be made for them, that they may be tran&s;ported to <HI>Africa,</HI> where they might probably live better than in any other coun|try; or be removed into tho&s;e places in this land where they may have profitable bu&s;ine&s;s, and are want|ed, now &s;o many are called from their farms to defend our country.&mdash;I &s;ay, if this be not done, the ma&s;ters, by freeing them, would lo&s;e nothing by it, even though they continue to &s;upport them, till &s;ome way &s;hall open for them to help them&s;elves. I mu&s;t here again de&s;ire every owner of &s;laves to make their ca&s;e his own, and

con&s;ider, if he or his children were unju&s;tly in a &s;tate of &s;lavery, whether he &s;hould think &s;uch an objection again&s;t their being &s;et at liberty of any weight? Would he not rather think it rea&s;onable that the ma&s;ters who had held them in bondage, again&s;t all right and rea&s;on, would con&s;ider their being, by an extraordinary provi|dence, rendered unprofitable to them, as an admonition to break off their &s;ins by righteou&s;ne&s;s and their iniquity by &s;hewing mercy to the&s;e poor? And that it ought to be a greater &s;atisfaction to them, thus to do ju&s;tice without delay, and relieve the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed poor, than to po&s;&s;e&s;s all the riches, honors and plea&s;ures of this world? And if the&s;e ma&s;ters &s;hould di&s;regard &s;uch an admonition, and neglect this opportunity to &s;et them at liberty, putting it off to a more convenient &s;ea&s;on, would it not be very grievous to him, and overwhelm him in de&s;pair of their ever doing it? Is it not very certain that they who make this objection again&s;t freeing their &s;laves without delay, would not free them, if the times &s;hould change, and they again become profitable! If they mu&s;t maintain them, can they not do it as well when they are free, as while they are &s;laves; and ought they not to do it with much more &s;atisfaction?</P>
<P>And as to the public, all nece&s;&s;ary regulations and provi&s;ion might ea&s;ily, and very &s;oon be made even in our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances, effectually to emancipate all our &s;laves, were the minds of men in general properly impre&s;&s;ed with their mi&s;ery, and they &s;ufficiently engaged to do ju&s;tice, and &s;hew mercy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">God is &s;o ordering it in his Providence, that it &s;eems ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary &s;omething &s;hould &s;peedily be done with re&s;pect to the &s;laves among us, in order to our &s;afety, and to prevent their turning again&s;t us in our pre&s;ent &s;truggle, in order to get their liberty. Our oppre&s;&s;ors have planned to gain the blacks, and induce them to take up arms again&s;t us, by promi&s;ing them li|berty, on this condition; and this plan they are pro&s;ecuting to the utmo&s;t of their power, by which means they have per&s;uaded numbers to join them.

This objection might be urged with much greater &s;hew of rea&s;on by the inhabitants of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> again&s;t freeing their &s;ervants when they were not only in a &s;tate of war, but &s;hut up, and clo&s;ely be&s;ieged in that city; yet we find it was their duty to free them imme|diately, as the only way to e&s;cape threatened de&s;truction; and as &s;oon as they had done this, they had re&s;pite, and would have obtained final deliverance, had they not re|turned to their old oppre&s;&s;ion, and again brought their freed &s;ervants into bondage.</P>
<P>This leads me to ob&s;erve, that our di&s;tre&s;&s;es are come upon us in &s;uch a way, and the occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent war is &s;uch, as in the mo&s;t clear and &s;triking manner to point out the &s;in of holding our blacks in &s;lavery, and admoni&s;h us to reform, and render us &s;hockingly in|con&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves, and amazingly guilty if we refu&s;e. God has rai&s;ed up men to attempt to deprive us of liberty; and the evil we are threatened with is &s;lavery. This, with our vigorous attempts to avoid it, is the ground of all our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and the general voice is, "We will die in the attempt, rather than &s;ubmit to &s;lavery." But are we at the &s;ame time making &s;laves of many thou&s;ands of our brethren, who have as good a right to liberty as our&s;elves, and to whom it is as &s;weet as it is to us, and the contrary as dreadful! Are we holding them in the mo&s;t abject, mi&s;erable &s;tate of &s;la|very, without the lea&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate feeling towards them or their po&s;terity; utterly refu&s;ing to take off the oppre&s;&s;ive galling yoke!

And in allu|&s;ion to the words of our Saviour, it may with great truth and propriety be &s;aid, "If he had not thus come in his Providence, and &s;poken unto us, (comparatively &s;peaking) we had not had &s;in, in making bond-&s;laves of our brethren; but now, we have no cloak for our &s;in."</P>
<P>And if we continue in this evil practice, and refu&s;e to let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free, under all this light and ad|monition, &s;uited to convince and reform us; and while God is evidently correcting us for it, as well as for other &s;ins, have we any rea&s;on to expect deliverance from the calamities we are under?

This was hinted in the beginning of our conver&s;ation, you may remember, and I am glad of an opportunity to con&s;ider it more particularly.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> You have repeatedly &s;poken of the attempt that is made to oppre&s;s and en&s;lave the <HI>American</HI> colonies, and the calamities this has introduced, as a judgment which God has brought upon us for en&s;laving the <HI>Af|ricans,</HI> and &s;ay we have no rea&s;on to expect deliverance, but &s;till greater judgments, unle&s;s this practice be re|formed. But is not this &s;uppo&s;ition incon&s;i&s;tent with the cour&s;e of divine Providence &s;ince this war began? Have we not been &s;trengthened and &s;ucceeded in our

How is this con&s;i&s;tent with the above &s;uppo&s;ition? If the&s;e calamities were brought on us for our &s;in in en&s;laving the <HI>Africans,</HI> and an expre&s;&s;ion of God's di&s;plea&s;ure with us on that ac|count, would he in &s;uch a &s;ignal manner appear on our &s;ide, and favour, protect and pro&s;per us; even &s;o that tho&s;e of our enemies, who are con&s;iderate and atten|tive, have been obliged to acknowledge God was for us; I &s;ay, could this be, while we per&s;i&s;t in that prac|tice &s;o offen&s;ive to him?</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> When I &s;peak of our being under the divine judg|ments for this &s;in of en&s;laving the <HI>Africans,</HI> I do not mean to exclude other public crying &s;ins found among us, &s;uch as impiety and profanene&s;s&mdash;formality and in|difference in the &s;ervice and cau&s;e of Chri&s;t and his re|ligion&mdash;and the various ways of open oppo&s;ition to it&mdash;intemperance and prodigality; and other in&s;tances of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c. the fruits of a mo&s;t criminal, con|tracted &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which is the &s;ource of the high handed oppre&s;&s;ion we are con&s;idering.

If we &s;hould be delivered while we continue in this evil practice and ob&s;tinately refu&s;e <HI>thoroughly</HI> to execute judgment between a man and his neighbour, but go on to oppre&s;s the &s;tranger, the fatherle&s;s, and the wi|dow, we &s;hould, agreeable to the &s;pirit of what you have ju&s;t &s;aid, improve &s;uch deliverance, as God &s;aid the <HI>Jews</HI> would have done, had he delivered them,

Even the prayer for &s;uch deliver|ance mu&s;t be an abomination to the Lord.</P>
<P>But your objection is worthy of a more particular an&s;wer.&mdash;It has been ob&s;erved, that there has been a general re&s;olution to &s;uppre&s;s the &s;lave-trade in the&s;e colonies, and to import no more &s;laves from <HI>Africa.</HI> This is a remarkable in&s;tance of our profe&s;&s;ed regard to ju&s;tice, and a wi&s;e and notable &s;tep towards a refor|mation of this evil; and, as has been ob&s;erved, a com|pleat reformation will be the unavoidable con&s;equence, if we will be con&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves. For no rea&s;on can be given for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the &s;lave-trade, which is not equally a rea&s;on for freeing all tho&s;e who have been reduced to a &s;tate of &s;lavery by that trade; and that &s;ame regard to ju&s;tice, humanity and mercy, which will induce us to acquie&s;ce in the former, will certain|ly oblige us to practice the latter. Have we not, there|fore, rea&s;on to think that the righteous, and infinitely merciful Governor of the world, has been plea&s;ed to te&s;tify his well-plea&s;edne&s;s with that regard to righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and mercy which we profe&s;&s;ed, and appeared to exerci&s;e, in refu&s;ing to import any more &s;laves; and which is an implicit condemnation of all the &s;lavery practi&s;ed among us, by appearing on our &s;ide in the re|markable, extraordinary manner you have mentioned; by which wonderful interpo&s;ition in our favour, he has at the &s;ame time given us the greate&s;t encouragement not to &s;top what we have begun, but to go on to a thorough reformation, and act con&s;i&s;tently with our|&s;elves, by breaking every yoke, and doing ju&s;tice to all our oppre&s;&s;ed &s;laves; as well as to repent of and reform all our open, public &s;ins? So that God is hereby &s;hew|ing us what he can do for us, and how happy we may

be, under his protection, if we will <HI>thoroughly</HI> amend our ways, and our doings; and loudly calling us to a thorough reformation, in this mo&s;t kind and winning way.</P>
<P>But if we ob&s;tinately refu&s;e to reform, what we have implicitly declared to be wrong, and engaged to put away the holding the <HI>Africans</HI> in &s;lavery, which is &s;o particularly pointed out by the evil with which we are threatened, and is &s;uch a glaring contradiction to our profe&s;&s;ed aver&s;ion to &s;lavery, and &s;truggle for civil liberty; and improve the favour God is &s;hewing us, as an argument in favour of this iniquity, and encourage|ment to per&s;i&s;t in it, as you, Sir, have ju&s;t now done, have we not the greate&s;t rea&s;on to fear, yea, may we not with great certainty conclude, God will yet with|draw his kind protection from us, and puni&s;h us yet &s;even times more? This has been God's u&s;ual way of dealing with his profe&s;&s;ing people; and who can &s;ay it is not mo&s;t rea&s;onable and wi&s;e?

Are they not, at lea&s;t many of them, as capable of judging in this matter, as you your&s;elves are; and therefore more likely to judge right than you, as they are unintere&s;ted and impartial? The conviction of the unju&s;tifiablene&s;s of this practice has been increa&s;ing, and greatly &s;pread of late; and many who have had &s;laves, have found them&s;elves &s;o unable to ju&s;tify their own conduct in holding them in bondage, as to be induced to &s;et them at liberty.

<P>Be intreated al&s;o &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, how very of|fen&s;ive to God, unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and the oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor, the &s;tranger and fatherle&s;s, is repre&s;ented to be, in the holy &s;cripture. This is often &s;poken of as the procuring cau&s;e of the calamities that came on God's profe&s;&s;ing people of old, and of their final ruin. It may &s;uffice to quote a few pa&s;&s;ages of this tenor, and refer you to places where others are to be found. <HI>Jer.</HI> xxi. 12. "O hou&s;e of David, thus &s;aith the LORD, Execute judgment in the morning, <HI>and deliver him that is &s;poiled out of the hand of the oppre&s;&s;or,</HI> le&s;t my fury go out like fire, and burn, that none can quench it, be|cau&s;e of the evil of your doings." <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxii. 29, 30, 31.

<P>Are not the <HI>African</HI> &s;laves among us the poor, the &s;trangers, the fatherle&s;s, who are oppre&s;&s;ed and vexed, and &s;old for &s;ilver?

<P>On the contrary, mercy, deliverance and pro&s;perity were often promi&s;ed them, if they would leave off their oppre&s;&s;ions, and do ju&s;tice, and &s;hew mercy, in deliver|ing the oppre&s;&s;ed, and &s;hewing kindne&s;s to the &s;tranger and the poor. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> i. 16,&mdash;18.

<P>How can we attend to the voice of God in the&s;e &s;a|cred writings, and not &s;ee that you are mo&s;t clearly pointed out. And will you be affronted, or even di&s;|regard us, while we intreat and conjure you, by all that is important and &s;acred, &s;o far to regard the&s;e threat|nings and promi&s;es, and pur&s;ue your own highe&s;t in|tere&s;t and that of the public, as to let your oppre&s;&s;ed &s;laves go out free!

or that is done without the love and exerci&s;e of mercy; but rejects all &s;uch prayers and &s;ervice, as mo&s;t di&s;ho|nourable and abominable to him. And when we con|&s;ider, that Chri&s;tianity is the greate&s;t in&s;tance and ex|hibition of righteou&s;ne&s;s and mercy that was ever known, or can be conceived of: And the great Author of it is, in the mo&s;t eminent and glorious degree, THE JUST GOD AND THE SAVIOUR; we &s;hall not wonder that no offering can be acceptable to him, which is without the exerci&s;e and practi&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s and mercy: And that "he &s;hall have judgment without mercy, that hath &s;hewed no mercy."</P>
<P>You who are profe&s;&s;ors of religion, and yet the own|ers of &s;laves, are intreated well to con&s;ider, how you mu&s;t appear in the &s;ight of God, and of all who view your conduct in a true light, while you attend your fa|mily and public devotions, and &s;it down from time to time, at the table of the Lord. If your neighbour wrong you of a few &s;hillings, you think him utterly unfit to attend that &s;acred ordinance with you; but what is this, to the wrong you are doing to your bre|thren, whom you are holding in &s;lavery! Should a man at <HI>Algiers</HI> have a number of your children his &s;laves, and &s;hould, by &s;ome means be converted, and become a profe&s;&s;or of Chri&s;tianity, would you not expect he would &s;oon &s;et your children at liberty? And if after you had particularly dealt with him about, it, and of|fered abundant light and matter of conviction, of the oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty of which he was guilty, he &s;hould be deaf to all you could &s;ay, and re&s;olve to hold them and their children in &s;lavery, what would you think of him, when you &s;ee him at his prayers, and attending at the Lord's &s;upper? Would you think he was more acceptable to God, than if he neglected the&s;e in&s;titutions, and yet had been &s;o ju&s;t and merciful, as to &s;et all his &s;laves at liberty? Yea, would you &s;cruple to &s;ay, his devotion and attendance on the holy &s;upper were hypocri&s;y and abomination? If <HI>Nathan</HI> the
<PB N="68" REF="019044_0067_0FA9AD99A5106F10">
prophet was here, he would &s;ay, "<HI>Thou art the man</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is granted this oppre&s;&s;ion has been practi&s;ed in ignorance by many, if not the mo&s;t, who have been owners of &s;laves: And though this has been a very criminal ignorance; yet profe&s;&s;ors of religion, and real chri&s;tians may have lived in this &s;in through ignorance, con&s;i&s;tent with &s;incerity, and &s;o as to be acceptable to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in their devotions, &amp;c. But though God has in time pa&s;&s;ed, &s;uffered us, ignorantly, to walk in this wicked way, he is NOW u&s;ing &s;pecial means to open our eyes, and commands all, every where, to repent of his iniquity. And they who per&s;i&s;t in this &s;in, in oppo&s;ition to the clear light, and alarming admonitions which are now &s;et before us, will greatly aggravate their own guilt, if they do not hereby give ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the &s;incerity of their profe&s;&s;ion. Some, who are in the &s;criptures, declared to be good men, lived in evil practices, con|&s;i&s;tent with &s;incerity in their attendance on divine in&s;titutions; in which practices no Chri&s;tian can now live, con&s;i&s;tent with his Chri&s;tian character; becau&s;e we enjoy much greater light than they had, and the&s;e evil ways are more fully expo&s;ed and con|demned.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The Friends, who are commonly called Quakers, have been for a number of years, bearing te&s;timony again&s;t this oppre&s;&s;ion, as incon&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tianity; and &s;triving to purge them&s;elves of this iniquity, re|jecting tho&s;e from fellow&s;hip with them, who will not free their &s;laves. They indeed do not attend the Lord's &s;upper; and it is granted, they are herein neglecting an important in&s;titution of Chri&s;t: But ought it not to alarm you to think, that while you are condemning them for this neglect, your attendance, in the omi&s;&s;ion of that righteou&s;ne&s;s and mercy which they practi&s;e, is inexpre&s;&s;ibly more di&s;honorable and offen&s;ive to Chri&s;t, than their neglect! The&s;e things you ought <HI>fir&s;t</HI> to have done, to let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free, and break every yoke; and then not leave the other undone.</P>
<P>May you all, in this day of your vi&s;itation, know and practice the things that belong to your peace, and the &s;afety and happine&s;s of the united <HI>American</HI> colo|nies, by no longer oppre&s;&s;ing the&s;e <HI>poor &s;trangers</HI> wrong|fully,

and doing violence to them; but by executing judgment, relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed, and deliver the &s;poiled out of the hands of the oppre&s;&s;or!

<P><HI>To the Second Edition of the Dialogue, con|cerning the Slavery of the</HI> Africans.</P>
<P>SINCE the fir&s;t edition of the foregoing dialogue, peace has been re&s;tored to the <HI>American</HI> States; in which they have obtained all that for which they have contended, and more; and are become free and inde|pendent. Thus we have had pro&s;perity, and the &s;miles of Heaven, in our attempts, while the &s;lavery of the <HI>Africans</HI> has not been wholly aboli&s;hed by us. This may be con&s;idered by &s;ome, as an evidence that this &s;lavery, and even the &s;lave-trade, are not &s;o great and heaven-provoking &s;ins, as they are repre&s;ented to be in the dialogue; and that the repeated declarations there, that we could not rea&s;onably expect pro&s;perity, until this iniquity was reformed, were groundle&s;s and ra&s;h.</P>
<P>The following ob&s;ervations, it is hoped, will &s;erve to give a ju&s;t view of this matter.</P>
<P>I. Since the publication of the dialogue, many things have been done, and &s;teps taken, toward a reformation of this evil. In the &s;tates of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire, the &s;lavery of the blacks is wholly aboli&s;hed. And it is one of the fundamental articles in the con&s;titution of the propo&s;ed &s;tate of Vermont, that no &s;lavery &s;hall be tolerated there. The &s;tates of Rhode-I&s;land, Connecticut, Penn&s;ylvania, and the lower coun|ties on Delaware, have provided for the gradual abolition
<PB N="70" REF="019044_0069_0FA9AD9BA8E49508">
of &s;lavery; and ordered that all the blacks who &s;hall be hereafter born in tho&s;e &s;tates, &s;hall be free at a cer|tain age. And that no more &s;laves &s;hall be introduced among them. And the &s;tate of Virginia has repealed a law, which was formerly in force there again&s;t the freeing of blacks; and now allows the ma&s;ters of &s;laves to free them when they plea&s;e. Thus all the &s;tates but five, have manife&s;ted a di&s;po&s;ition to promote the free|dom of the <HI>Africans.</HI> And numbers of &s;laves, have been liberated by their ma&s;ters, under a conviction of the unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of holding them in &s;lavery.</P>
<P>This is a great advance in the de&s;ired reformation, and has given ground to hope, that &s;lavery will be wholly aboli&s;hed in all the United States of <HI>America.</HI> And may it not be con&s;idered as one rea&s;on why the omni&s;cient, long-&s;uffering Governor of the world has &s;pared and pro&s;pered us, as he hath done?</P>
<P>II. Though we have been thus &s;aved and pro&s;pered, evil <HI>may,</HI> and we have rea&s;on to fear it <HI>will</HI> come upon us, if we do not proceed to a thorough reformation of this &s;in; e&s;pecially upon the&s;e &s;tates in which there is no degree of reformation. What has taken place &s;ince the peace, chiefly by our own imprudence, extravagance and folly, by which our trade is almo&s;t ruined, and the&s;e &s;tates are in a great mea&s;ure drained of their mo|ney, and many evils are introduced, is enough to &s;hew us how ea&s;ily, and how &s;oon, we may be made mi&s;e|rable and be ruined as a nation, after all that God hath done for us; and, at the &s;ame time, is an evidence that he is di&s;plea&s;ed, and hath a controver&s;y with us.</P>
<P>And we may ea&s;ily account for this, notwith&s;tanding the partial reformation re&s;pecting &s;lavery, which has been mentioned, when we con&s;ider that amid&s;t other open &s;ins and in&s;tances of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, we are again going into the practice of that &s;even-fold abomination, THE SLAVE TRADE: again&s;t which, in the begin|ning of the war, we bore public te&s;timony, and en|tered into a united and &s;olemn re&s;olution wholly to re|nounce it, and all connection with tho&s;e who &s;hould
<PB N="71" REF="019044_0070_0FA9AD9C3B6EB8C0">
per&s;i&s;t in this evil practice. A number of ve&s;&s;els have been &s;ent from &s;ome of the &s;tates in New-England, and from other &s;tates, to <HI>Africa,</HI> to procure &s;laves, and they are in &s;uch demand in the We&s;t-Indies, and &s;ome of the &s;outhern &s;tates, e&s;pecially South Carolina, that &s;e|veral &s;ucce&s;sful voyages have been made, and thou&s;ands of &s;laves brought into the&s;e United States, and &s;old at an extraordinary price, by which others are tempted and encouraged to go into this trade; and there is a pro&s;pect that it will take place to as great a degree as it has heretofore, unle&s;s it &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e in public authority, or by the people at large.</P>
<P>Are not the &s;tory and denunciations of evil, which we have in the prophecy of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> chap. xxxv. ap|plicable to this ca&s;e? The inhabitants of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> were be&s;ieged by the army of the King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and brought into great di&s;tre&s;s and fears of utter ruin: Upon which, being convinced of their &s;in in the practice of &s;lavery, which had taken place among them, they being led to it by their King and princes, entered into a re|&s;olution and &s;olemn covenant to free all their &s;laves. Soon after this their enemies rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and they thought them&s;elves delivered; but when their fears and di&s;tre&s;s were thus removed, they returned to their former practice, and reduced to &s;lavery the &s;ervants they had &s;et at liberty. God then directed <HI>Jeremiah</HI> to tell them, that &s;ince they had returned to their former ini|quity, which they had &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to relinqui&s;h, and refu&s;ed liberty to their brethren, he would pro|claim a liberty for them; even a mo&s;t dreadful liberty to the &s;word, to the pe&s;tilence, and to the famine, and cau&s;e them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth, &amp;c. If this barbarous trade &s;hould go on, and &s;lavery be &s;till encouraged and promoted in the&s;e &s;tates, and yet we e&s;cape the de&s;truction which came on the inhabitants of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> or evils that &s;hall be as great, it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to mere, &s;overeign, di&s;tingui&s;hing mercy, which we have no rea&s;on to expect.</P>
