<P>IT has long been regretted as a Misfortune to the Youth of this Province, that we have no <HI>ACADEMY,</HI> in which they might receive the Ac|compli&s;hments of a regular Education.</P>
<P>The following Paper of <HI>Hints</HI> towards form|ing a Plan for that Purpo&s;e, is &s;o far approv'd by &s;ome publick-&s;pirited Gentlemen, to whom it has been privately communicated, that they have directed a Number of Copies to be made by the Pre&s;s, and properly di&s;tributed, in order to ob|tain the Sentiments and Advice of Men of Learning, Under&s;tanding, and Experience in the&s;e Matters; and have determin'd to u&s;e their Inte|re&s;t and be&s;t Endeavours, to have the Scheme, when compleated, carried gradually into Execu|tion; in which they have Rea&s;on to believe they &s;hall have the hearty Concurrence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of many who are Wellwi&s;hers to their Country.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who incline to favour the De&s;ign with their Advice, either as to the Parts of Learning to be taught, the Order of Study, the Meth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of Teaching, the Oeconomy of the School, or any o|ther Matter of Importance to the Succe&s;s of the Undertaking, are de&s;ired to communicate their Sentiments as &s;oon as may be, by Letter directed to <HI>B.

<P>THE good Education of Youth has been e&s;teemed by wi&s;e Men in all A|ges, as the &s;ure&s;t Foundation of the Happine&s;s both of private Families and of Common-wealths. Almo&s;t all Govern|ments have therefore made it a principal Ob|ject of their Attention, to e&s;tabli&s;h and endow with proper Revenues, &s;uch Seminaries of Learning, as might &s;upply the &s;ucceeding Age with Men qualified to &s;erve the Publick with Honour to them&s;elves, and to their Country.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>As &s;ome Things here propos'd may be found to differ a little from the Forms of Education in common U&s;e, the following Quotations are to &s;hew the Opinions of &s;everal learned Men, who have carefully con&s;idered and wrote expre&s;ly on the Sub|ject; &s;uch as <HI>Milton, Locke, Rollin, Turnbull,</HI> and others. They generally complain, that the <HI>old Method</HI> is in many Re|&s;pects wrong; but long &s;ettled Forms are not ea&s;ily changed. For us, who are now to make a Beginning, 'tis, at lea&s;t, as ea|&s;y to &s;et out right as wrong; and therefore their Sentiments are on this Occa&s;ion well worth our Con&s;ideration.</P><P>Mr. <HI>Rollin</HI> &s;ays <HI>(Belles Lett. p.</HI> 249. &s;peaking of the Manner of Educating Youth) "Though it be generally a very wi&s;e and judicious Rule to avoid all Singularity, and to follow the re|ceived Cu&s;toms, yet I que&s;tion whether, in the Point we now treat of, this Principle does not admit of &s;ome Exception, and whether we ought not to apprehend the Dangers and Inconveni|encies of blindly following the Foot&s;teps of tho&s;e who have gone before us, &s;o as to con&s;ult <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> more than <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and the go|verning our Actions rather by what others <HI>do,</HI> than by what they <HI>&s;hould do</HI>; from whence it often happens, that an Error once e&s;tabli&s;hed is handed down from Age to Age, and becomes almo&s;t a certain Law, from a Notion, that we ought to act like the re&s;t of Mankind, and follow the Example of the greate&s;t Number. But human Nature is not &s;o happy as to have the greate&s;t Number always make the be&s;t Choice, and we too frequently ob&s;erve the contrary."</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="006321_0005_1028A063D46B9D88">Many of the fir&s;t Settlers of the&s;e Provinces, were Men who had received a good Education in <HI>Europe,</HI> and to their Wi&s;dom and good Ma|nagement we owe much of our pre&s;ent Pro&s;pe|rity. But their Hands were full, and they could not do all Things. The pre&s;ent Race are not thought to be generally of equal Abili|ty: For though the <HI>American</HI> Youth are al|low'd not to want Capacity; yet the be&s;t Ca|pacities require Cultivation, it being truly with them, as with the be&s;t Ground, which unle&s;s well tilled and &s;owed with profitable Seed, produces only ranker Weeds.</P>

Up|on this Account it is, that any &s;ort of Speaking, &s;o as will make him be under&s;tood, is not thought enough for a Gentle|man. He ought to &s;tudy <HI>Grammar,</HI> among the other Helps of Speaking well, but it <HI>mu&s;t be</HI> THE GRAMMAR OF HIS OWN TONGUE, of the Language he u&s;es, that he may under&s;tand his own Country Speech nicely, and &s;peak it properly, without &s;hocking the Ears of tho&s;e it is addre&s;&s;ed to with Soleci&s;ms and offen&s;ive Irregularities. And to this Purpo&s;e <HI>Grammar is nece&s;|&s;ary</HI>; but it is the Grammar <HI>only</HI> of <HI>their own proper Tongues,</HI> and to tho&s;e who would take Pains in cultivating their Lan|guage, and perfecting their Stiles. Whether all Gentlemen &s;hould not do this, I leave to be con&s;idered, &s;ince the Want of Propriety and Grammatical Exactne&s;s is thought very mi&s;be|coming one of that Rank, and u&s;ually draws on one guilty of &s;uch Faults, the Imputation of having had a lower Breeding and wor&s;e Company than &s;uits with his Quality. If this be &s;o (as I &s;uppo&s;e it is) it will be Matter of Wonder, why young Gentlemen are forc'd to learn the Grammars of foreign and dead Languages, and are never once told of the Grammar of their own Tongues. They do not &s;o much as know there is any &s;uch Thing, much le&s;s is it made their Bu&s;ine&s;s to be in|&s;tructed in it. Nor is their own Language ever propos'd to them as worthy their Care and Cultivating, tho' they have <HI>dai|ly U&s;e</HI> of it, and are not &s;eldom, in the future Cour&s;e of their Lives, judg'd of by their hand&s;ome or awkward Way of ex|pre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves in it. Whereas the Languages who&s;e Gram|mars they have been &s;o much employed in, are &s;uch as proba|bly they &s;hall &s;carce ever &s;peak or write; or if upon Occa&s;ion this &s;hould happen, they &s;hould be excu&s;ed for the Mi&s;takes and Faults they make in it. Would not a <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> who took No|tice of this Way of Breeding, be apt to imagine, that all our young Gentlemen were de&s;igned to be Teachers and Profe&s;&s;ors of the dead Languages of foreign Countries, and not to be Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s in their own." Page 255. the &s;ame Author adds, That if Grammar ought to be taught at any Time, it mu&s;t be to one that can &s;peak the Language already; how el&s;e can he be taught the Grammar of it? This at lea&s;t is evident from the Practice of the wi&s;e and learned Nations among the Antients. They made it a <HI>Part of Education</HI> to cultivate <HI>their own,</HI> not foreign Tongues. The <HI>Greeks</HI> counted all other Nations barba|rous, and had a Contempt for their Languages. And though the <HI>Greek</HI> Learning grew in Credit among&s;t the <HI>Romans</HI> towards the End of their Commonwealth, yet it was the <HI>Roman</HI> Tongue that was made the Study of their Youth: <HI>Their own</HI> Language they were to make U&s;e of, and therefore it was <HI>their own</HI> Lan|guage they were <HI>in&s;tructed</HI> and <HI>exerci&s;ed</HI> in." And p. 281. "There can &s;carce be a greater Defect (&s;ays he) in a Gentle|man, than not to expre&s;s him&s;elf well either in Writing or Speaking.

If, &s;ays he, there be any &s;uch Thing as DUTY, or any &s;uch Thing as HAPPINESS; if there be any Difference between right and wrong Conduct; any Di&s;tinction between Virtue and Vice, or Wi&s;dom and Folly; in fine, if there be any &s;uch Thing as Perfection or Imperfection belong|ing to the rational Powers which con&s;titute moral Agents; or if Enjoyments and Pur&s;uits admit of Compari&s;on; <HI>Good Educa|tion</HI> mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be acknowledged to mean, <HI>proper Care</HI> to in&s;truct early in the Science of Happine&s;s and Duty, or in the Art of Judging and <HI>Acting aright</HI> in Life.
