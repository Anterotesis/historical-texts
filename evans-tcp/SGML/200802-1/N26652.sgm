<P>THREE interpretations may be given to the&s;e words.</P>
<P N="1">1. It was the cu&s;tom of ancient, as it is of mod|ern, nations, to excite the courage of their armies, when going to battle, by in&s;trumental mu&s;ick. The Etrurians, for this purpo&s;e, u&s;ed the trumpet; the Lacedemonians, the pipe; and the Egyptians, the drum. The Hebrew people, ever in&s;tructed to borrow nothing of idolatrous manners, are here taught to acquire the nece&s;&s;ary valour to combat and vanqui&s;h their foes, by &s;imply employing their voices in &s;inging the wondrous power and acts of their divine deliverer. This is one interpretation of the words.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Con&s;ult the argument to this p&s;alm in bi&s;hop Patrick's Paraphra&s;e.</NOTE> In its ju&s;tification is adduced the following pa&s;&s;age of the &s;acred Chronicles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">B.

<P N="2">2. A &s;econd con&s;truction of the text &s;uppo&s;es the p&s;alm, from which it is taken, to have been compo&s;ed in honour of &s;ome recent &s;ucce&s;&s;es, that had crowned the Jewi&s;h arms, for which the peo|ple of God are exhorted to celebrate his goodne&s;s, and, at the &s;ame time, to retain their martial hab|its, as a con&s;tant terrour to their enemies.</P>
<P N="3">3. La&s;tly, It is notorious that the Jews, after returning from captivity at Babylon, were infe&s;t|ed by a dangerous oppo&s;ition to their liberties at home and abroad, which, through remarkable a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the divine providence, they finally cru&s;hed. Po&s;&s;ibly the writer of this &s;ublime and animated hymn de&s;igned to in&s;pirit the patriots of his age to pur&s;ue and complete a triumph over their impious adver&s;aries: and this con&s;truction is rendered almo&s;t probable by the context.</P>

<P>Since it is now impo&s;&s;ible, however, to know the author and date of this production, it is equal|ly difficult and needle&s;s to a&s;certain the exclu&s;ive meaning of that portion of it, which is prefixed to
<PB N="7" REF="035443_0005_10049A8CD1E36C08">
this di&s;cour&s;e. Combining, therefore, in &s;ome &s;ort, its various &s;en&s;es abovementioned, we will con&s;ider the text as giving us the two-fold le&s;&s;on of <HI>piety</HI> and the u&s;e of <HI>arms.</HI> Let us examine the opera|tion of both in the light of means, by which a na|tion may retain its liberties, and defend its rights again&s;t unju&s;t enemies.</P>
<P>I. We will ob&s;erve the tendency of national piety. It conduces to the ob&s;ervance of religious in&s;titutions, to per&s;onal virtue, to the di&s;charge of relative duties, and to the publick order, union, and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P N="1">1. A principle of piety in a people induces its ob&s;ervance of religious in&s;titutions. The heart, that is warmed with the admiration and love of the divine perfections, honours the means of moral improvement. If revelation had taught to her di&s;ciples no forms of wor&s;hip, which nature had not &s;ugge&s;ted to her children, the &s;ervant of God would &s;till have &s;ought in &s;ociety an enlargement of religious affections, which the &s;ecre&s;y and &s;ilence of his clo&s;et could hardly create. His benevo|lence, too, the off&s;pring of piety, would have led him to provide for the in&s;truction and con&s;olation of creatures ignorant, weak, and dependent like him&s;elf. But now that the authority of religious ordinances is known to be divine; now that the law hath been di&s;pen&s;ed by Mo&s;es, and grace and truth have beamed upon mankind in the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the man of piety is the ob&s;erver of publick wor&s;hip, not merely on account of its rea&s;onablene&s;s and utility, but from a principle of regard to God.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="035443_0006_1004C9DCE4E772E0">
Imagine now, my hearers, a whole community attending on the in&s;titutions of religion from a principle of piety. What augu&s;t and influential notions do they hence receive of the object of their prai&s;es! What a &s;en&s;e of mutual obligations and dependence; and what motives to relieve, to &s;trengthen, to defend, to ble&s;s &s;ociety! Indeed, whence but from religious in&s;titutions can that portion of knowledge be derived to the common|alty of a &s;tate, which is ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to the maintenance of its liberties? Accordingly the hi&s;|torian of elder times and the ob&s;erver of the pre&s;|ent age uniformly report, that where the in&s;titutes of chri&s;tianity have been mo&s;t intelligibly and con|&s;cientiou&s;ly reverenced, there liberty has dwelt with the greate&s;t &s;ecurity and plea&s;ure. Yes, ye de&s;pots of the earth, and ye, who cruelly invade the rights of mankind, it is undoubtedly your in|tere&s;t to overturn the altar, and unhallow the &s;ab|bath, becau&s;e the a&s;hes of the&s;e rites produce an ignorance, which will fo&s;ter your crimes.</P>
<P N="2">2. A principle of piety promotes per&s;onal vir|tue. As there can be no genuine religion without morality, &s;o there is no &s;afe morality without re|ligion. If morals are the lamp, the fear of God is the oil, which mu&s;t give it a &s;trong and uniform lu&s;tre. Regard to temporary health, tranquillity, and honour, forms, of it&s;elf, a character of imperfect goodne&s;s. On the other hand, re&s;pect to the will, and reference to the perpetual notice of the Deity, ju&s;t views of his benevolence and purity, and a &s;en&s;e of accountablene&s;s to him at the final judgment of the world, deeply imprinted in the &s;oul, tend di|rectly
<PB N="9" REF="035443_0007_1004C9DF7B520518">
to the &s;anctification and exaltation of man. Becau&s;e he &s;ees &s;u&s;pended over his head the &s;word of retributive ju&s;tice, he avoids anger, pride, and inordinate plea&s;ures; and he practi&s;es meekne&s;s and moderation, temperance and indu&s;try, becau&s;e, by the appointment of God, they are connected with eternal joys. Thus, a &s;entiment of religion, whil&s;t it commands the will, enli&s;teth al&s;o the affections in the cau&s;e of virtue.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible here not to &s;ee the connexion between piety, and the political &s;trength and free|dom. If the citizens of a &s;tate were univer&s;ally pious, their labours and diligence would procure them wealth, whil&s;t their wealth would not be fol|lowed by luxury, and the con&s;equent reign of the malevolent pa&s;&s;ions. <HI>Whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your lu&s;ts, that war in your members?</HI> In a country, where private virtue is remitted proportionally to the in|crea&s;e of the common opulence and grandeur, in|ternal competitions and &s;trife will certainly ari&s;e: the&s;e the ambitious of neighbouring &s;tates will em|ploy and point again&s;t its liberties, whil&s;t the di&s;|tracted citizens, enervated by indolence and vice, have only to choo&s;e between an inglorious death, and a life of &s;ervitude and repentance. It is piety, then, which, by promoting the virtue of individ|uals, operates the &s;alvation and happine&s;s of the community.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is piety, that excites a performance of relative duties. A moment's reflection informs every man, even in younger life, that he was not made &s;olely for him&s;elf. He &s;ees his &s;ocial obliga|tions
<PB N="10" REF="035443_0008_1004C9E2015F1EB8">
multiply with his years. His friend, his brother, his countryman, the &s;tranger, all prefer him their claims. Is a principle of &s;elf-gratification, of vanity, family-pride, or thir&s;t of di&s;tinction, al|ways competent to their di&s;charge? The hi&s;tory of infidels and athei&s;ts proves the truth of the negative. Ungoverned by a principle of piety, the affluent and powerful will be in&s;olent and op|pre&s;&s;ive; the weak and dependent will be ungrate|ful and mutinous. Where motives of worldly intere&s;t and fame are &s;uffered to hold the &s;upreme rule, elevation of rank will be u&s;ed merely to ter|rify and control. The &s;ervant will tremble in per|petual apprehen&s;ion of his lord's di&s;plea&s;ure, and the lord will be equally &s;u&s;picious of the &s;ervant's treachery. There will be a con&s;tant war among all cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety. Caprice and pa&s;&s;ion will break a&s;under the ties of con&s;anguinity and friend|&s;hip; and no bands will be found &s;ufficiently &s;trong, by which the mo&s;t &s;olemn and lovely con|nexions in human life can be &s;aved from di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>Religion, on the contrary, &s;trengthens every tie, and fortifies every obligation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a favourite idea of the celebrated Neckar. It is, in &s;hort, the vital principle of his book "On the Importance of Religious Opinions."</NOTE> It in&s;pires conde&s;cen&s;ion and gentlene&s;s in the great, and clothes the powerful with the &s;weet and re&s;i&s;tle&s;s charms of kindne&s;s. It helps the lowly cottager to &s;u&s;tain the inferiority of his &s;tation; the inno|cent pri&s;oner, the weight of his chains; and the wretched of every name, the burden of his woes; by pre&s;enting to their full view the providence and agency of God; and by putting, in the place
<PB N="11" REF="035443_0009_1004C9E38B4E3210">
of their feelings, a lively faith, that the virtues of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and contentment are de&s;tined to en|throne them in the kingdom of heaven. Mutual confidence is thus cheri&s;hed amid all ranks in the &s;tate. Every citizen faithfully di&s;charges his re|&s;pective tru&s;t; and from the con&s;tant tribute, which flows to the commonwealth from individual hone&s;ty and dome&s;tick continence, her <HI>peace becomes as a river, and her righteou&s;ne&s;s as the waves of the &s;ea.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Still more particularly and directly does a pious principle contribute to the publick order, union, and pro&s;perity. It is this, which binds the &s;ubject to the governour. Without government, there can be no order in civil &s;ociety; without oaths, there can be no government; without piety, oaths have neither u&s;e nor meaning. It is, therefore, in religion, that the ruled finds the guar|antee of his rights. Convince him that there is no God, or, which is much the &s;ame, that he does not govern and judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and you &s;ubvert his faith in the ruler. He will no longer willingly &s;ubmit to the re&s;traints of power; he is at once prepared for in&s;urrection and pillage.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame principle, likewi&s;e, that obliges the magi&s;trate to the &s;ubject. It places him beneath the immediate and perpetual cognizance of the king of kings. It arre&s;ts him in every project of per&s;onal aggrandizement to the detriment of the citizen. It confines his &s;tudies and toil to the general good.</P>
<P>Hence the peaceful reign of law and order in the &s;tate, the cement of national union, and the multiplication of re&s;ources again&s;t the common danger. In no way can a &s;tate realize the&s;e ble&s;&s;|ings,
<PB N="12" REF="035443_0010_1004C9E61B3197F8">
and enjoy its liberties, except by di&s;intere&s;t|edne&s;s in the governour, obedience in the private citizen, ob&s;ervance of publick faith, and a prompt execution of ju&s;tice; except, in &s;hort, by national piety.</P>
<P>Accordingly the frequent recurrence to antiqui|ty on this &s;ubject is always ju&s;tified, by the multi|tude of proofs it furni&s;hes, of the ri&s;e and glory of empires by righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of their declen&s;ion and downfal by wickedne&s;s. It &s;hould be account|ed neither puerile nor pedantick in the morali&s;t, when he tells us, that the ravages of impiety and luxury were more injurious to the Romans, than tho&s;e of Pyrrhus or Hannibal; and that vice was the ruin of the Grecian &s;tates. E&s;pecially does the page of Jewi&s;h hi&s;tory pre&s;ent to our view, in a luminous and impre&s;&s;ive manner the influence and effects of piety on the Hebrew nation. It was this, that made her populous, free, and rich, and that poured into her lap the charming joys of peace and plenty. It was this, which made her <HI>beautiful as</HI> her own <HI>Tirzah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Can. vi. 4</NOTE> <HI>comely as</HI> her &s;till fairer capital, <HI>and,</HI> at the &s;ame time, <HI>terrible</HI> to her enemies <HI>as an army with banners.</HI> It was piety, in fine, that &s;o ex|actly mea&s;ured her pro&s;perity, and &s;o notoriou&s;ly determined her fate, that the fact was the con&s;tant burden of her &s;acred &s;ongs. <HI>The Lord taketh plea&s;|ure in them that fear him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;alm cxlvii. 11, 12, 13.</NOTE> <HI>in tho&s;e that hope in his mercy. Prai&s;e the Lord, O Jeru&s;alem. Prai&s;e thy God, O Zion: for he hath &s;trengthened the bars of thy gates, he hath ble&s;&s;ed thy children within thee.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore it is a ju&s;t and &s;afe conclu&s;ion, that the piety of a people is one important and happy
<PB N="13" REF="035443_0011_1004C9E7A551A660">
means of its defence; that it directly &s;erves its in|ternal wealth, population, order, and union; and that, as eminent virtue &s;preads a glory round indi|viduals to the &s;hame and dread of their enemies, &s;o the righteou&s;ne&s;s of a community erects, as it were, a wall of fire between it and its foes.</P>
<P>Such, neverthele&s;s, my hearers, is the di&s;jointed &s;tate of morals in our world, &s;uch the re&s;tle&s;s am|bition of man, corrupted by the love and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, that not even innocence and piety are &s;ecure from his depredating and oppre&s;&s;ive hand. The devotion and beneficence of Elijah did not &s;hield him from the per&s;ecution of Ahab; nor did the &s;anctity of the reverend Bapti&s;t divert the cru|elty of the Galilean tetrarch. States, too, are ex|po&s;ed to the &s;poliations of &s;tates; and the commu|nity, who&s;e only defence is virtue, is &s;ometimes the prey of violence from an unprincipled power.</P>
<P>In its patriotick addre&s;&s;es, therefore, the chri&s;|tian pulpit, contrary to its pacifick character, is compelled to be the advocate of arms, as well as of piety. <HI>Let the high prai&s;es of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged &s;word in their hand.</HI></P>
<P>II. That there are ca&s;es, in which both private and publick war is con&s;idered ju&s;t on the principles of natural and revealed religion, is the general con|ce&s;&s;ion of ethical writers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See e&s;pecially Hutche&s;on and Paley.</NOTE> How would the rights of the individual be deemed &s;afe, if the thief might rob, and the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in murder, him with impunity? If no violence were &s;uffered to inflict puni&s;hment on the one, and extort re&s;titution from the other, what value would be attached to property, or what
<PB N="14" REF="035443_0012_1004C9E942571B18">
comfort to life? Unprotected from the rapacity of the covetous, and the rude bla&s;ts of calumny, and unrecompen&s;ed by the court of ju&s;tice, the boa&s;t|ed ble&s;&s;ings of civilized man would be all an illu|&s;ion. Contra&s;ted with his condition, that of the hermit, or of the &s;avage, would be every way eligible.</P>
<P>As long, therefore, as the di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions &s;hall poi&s;on and convul&s;e &s;ociety, the civil ruler mu&s;t be ordained to arre&s;t and reclaim di&s;turbers of the peace. Even the di&s;ciple of the friendly Penn, if he would &s;ee the government effectual to its ends, mu&s;t provide for its exigencies, and put a &s;word into the hand of the magi&s;trate. For what is command without power, or law without pen|alty?</P>
<P>War between &s;tates is ju&s;tified for the &s;ame rea|&s;ons, which make it righteous between individuals. If the publick enemy of a country will not be gov|erned by the rules of eternal order, nor by laws e&s;tabli&s;hed by the common con&s;ent of nations; if he is neither awed into a pacifick temper by the lu&s;trous example of piety and meekne&s;s in the community he &s;eeks to oppre&s;s, nor di&s;armed of malice by its conciliatory propo&s;als, the intended victim of plunder and &s;lavery may religiou&s;ly arm in defence of its rights. Indeed an application of the principles of force is here publick &s;pirited and humane. Tyrants of the world &s;hould be taught to re&s;pect the liberties of their fellowmen; and their de&s;truction in one age &s;hould in&s;cribe a &s;alu|tary le&s;&s;on on the page of hi&s;tory for &s;ucceeding oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="035443_0013_1004C9EEAA6D4848">
However, then, the pity and &s;ighs of the &s;en&s;i|ble heart may be excited, from contemplating the horrible effects of war, we are obliged, under cer|tain circum&s;tances, to view an armed a&s;&s;ociation one of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary engines of &s;tate. Cor|roborative of this &s;entiment is the language of the &s;criptures, which thus animates the pious to re&s;i&s;t their in&s;ulting and tyrannick foes.</P>
<P><HI>Be of good courage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. x. 12.</NOTE> and let us play the men for our people, and the cities of our God. Be &s;trong and cou|rageous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. xxxii. 7,8.</NOTE> be not afraid nor di&s;mayed: for there be more with us than with him. With him is an arm of fle&s;h; but with us is the Lord our God, to help us, and to fight our battles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;alm cxliv. 1.</NOTE> Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, my &s;trength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t we pay homage to the ancient revelations of the Deity, let us not be under&s;tood to militate with his more valuable di&s;pen&s;ation by the great Reformer of mankind. We vindicate no war, which is not the legitimate off&s;pring of &s;elf-de|fence; none, incompatible with any &s;ober con|&s;truction of the precept, <HI>Re&s;i&s;t not evil;</HI> none, which embraces other objects, than &s;uch a re&s;titu|tion to the injured &s;tate, as &s;hall inhibit future aggre&s;&s;ions; none, in which a chri&s;tian country cannot con&s;i&s;tently appeal to the &s;overeign arbiter of nations for the rectitude of its cau&s;e, and con|fide the i&s;&s;ue to his ju&s;t deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Hence, although national piety alone mu&s;t be deemed an in&s;ufficient defence of national right, in the pre&s;ent condition of humanity, it is yet infinitely preferable to a military &s;y&s;tem altogether &s;upported by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and violence. Ruthle&s;s
<PB N="16" REF="035443_0014_1004C9F12C3058F0">
ravagers of our race are they, who levy war for the &s;ake of widening their territory, and filling their coffers. Execrable plagues of mankind are they, who find an occa&s;ion for their arms in the internal di&s;&s;en&s;ions, or defencele&s;s frontier of a neutral power, or who, for the &s;ake of connecting their names<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Read a rhap&s;ody of Buonaparte in one of his letters to a friend.</NOTE> with memorable events, lay wa&s;te the dwellings of the ju&s;t.</P>
<P>The war of &s;uch heroes is like the fury of &s;an|guinary cannibals, and the rage of the hungry ti|ger. Nay, it is impolitick. Their two edged &s;words mu&s;t finally prove fatal to them&s;elves, as well as the people they &s;poil. After being, for a while, di&s;turbed by their outrages, the world will ri&s;e and complete the repre&s;&s;ion of their arrogance. So &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on the human heart is a &s;en&s;e of equity, and &s;o happily is this &s;entiment improv|ed by the diffu&s;ion of religious knowledge, that the time approaches, when the abolition of tyranny &s;hall be con&s;idered the common cau&s;e of God and of man.</P>
<P>Wherefore, if a &s;y&s;tem of national defence, wholly pacifick, be ineffectual to the general &s;afety, through want of force and arms, a nation of &s;oldiers is doomed to a tran&s;ient exi&s;tence, from a deficiency of religious principle. The unarmed &s;aint is in|deed a defencele&s;s dove, the almo&s;t certain prey of the ravenous hawk; but the impious warrior is a de&s;tructive &s;erpent, who&s;e head, inheriting the univer&s;al odium, will eventually be brui&s;ed.</P>
<P>So then piety is a defence, and arms are a de|fence; but &s;ince neither, &s;ingly, will enable a na|tion

<P N="1">1. If the preceding remarks have a foundation in truth, let them in&s;truct us, my fellow citizens, in the&s;e eventful times. Probably at no period of her exi&s;tence, could our country have exhorted her &s;ons with greater propriety, than &s;he now can exhort them, to the exerci&s;e of arms. For a num|ber of years pa&s;t, we have &s;een a powerful nation in Europe, evidently actuated by principles of im|piety and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, making war upon a great part of the civilized world. With a force of conque&s;t, &s;carcely paralleled in any former age, the French Republick has diffu&s;ed death and me|naces throughout all Europe. Its arms have made Germany a field of battle: they have overtured the republicks of Venice and Geneva, and wa&s;ted their beautiful provinces: they have vanqui&s;hed and plundered Italy: they have put the yoke up|on Spain: they have rent in pieces the kingdom of Naples: they have drained Holland of its wealth, have &s;poiled Switzerland of its liberties and its glory, and have, in fact, left to no country, they have a&s;&s;ailed, ought but its moans. What is more intere&s;ting, and ju&s;tly alarming, to us, through each act of this &s;anguinary drama in Europe, the emi&s;&s;aries of France have been erecting their &s;tan|dard in this land of neutrality, and on the&s;e, alas,

too ho&s;pitable &s;hores, digging the grave of Ameri|can liberty!</P>
<P>Columbian warriors! where are your &s;words? If with the&s;e facts and examples before your eyes, you permit them to ru&s;t in their &s;cabbards, where is the expatriated Swi&s;s, or impoveri&s;hed Holland|er, what &s;hade of your fathers, who fell on Bunk|er's heights, or bled on the plains of Yorktown, who will not pronounce you unworthy the joys of freedom!</P>
<P>But I forget that the United States has mar|&s;halled her armies, and is prepared for her in&s;idi|ous foe. God be prai&s;ed, my countrymen, that we learn wi&s;dom from hi&s;tory and ob&s;ervation; that the Eye and Light and Strong Rod of our na|tion hath developed the ho&s;tile machinations of France, pointed to the means of their defeat, and already &s;courged the Directory in its own cabinet; that our armament on the &s;eas is protecting our commerce and adding to the naval di&s;grace of the common enemy; that our troops are gathering from every corner of the Union to the accu&s;tom|ed banners of the hoary Chief, who&s;e &s;ingle name commands the faith and courage of every Ameri|can &s;oldier; and that our political pro&s;pects are opening with brighter hopes, as a reward for the pious and manly efforts of our country to <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty, wherewith &s;he has been made free.</HI></P>
<P>Let us not, however, be deceived by &s;pecious ap|pearances. The fate of the unhappy Swi&s;s Can|tons continually awakens our &s;ad remembrance. Seven long years was France in di&s;&s;olving the Hel|vetick

If, in the &s;ame &s;pace of time, &s;he has not been equally &s;ucce&s;sful in accompli&s;hing her de&s;igns again&s;t the United States, let the truth in&s;pirit, not relax, our per&s;everance in tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which, under the guidance of heaven, have thus far baffled her views. Whil&s;t we continue our ap|peal to the divine providence, let us proceed to burni&s;h our arms and fortify our &s;hores. The mo&s;t correct information our country can furni&s;h<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Late proclamation for U. S. Fa&s;t.</NOTE> a&s;|&s;ures us, that our deare&s;t intere&s;ts are &s;till in jeop|ardy through the in&s;idiou&s;ne&s;s and ho&s;tility of the French nation. It yet views our lands with cu|pidity, and our independence with rage. In &s;uch a political juncture, every mea&s;ure, which prom|i&s;es the &s;malle&s;t &s;upport to the government or de|fence of the &s;tate, and e&s;pecially every armed e&s;tab|li&s;hment, is un&s;peakably e&s;timable.</P>
<P>In this point of view, therefore, gentlemen of the ANCIENT AND HONOURABLE ARTIL|LERY COMPANY, we exult in the continued exi&s;tence of your in&s;titution. We have loved and applauded your patrioti&s;m in the days of peace; but, in this hour of national danger, we honour and revere you. Permit us to hope, that a military college, which, for nearly two centuries, has con|tributed to the glory of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and who&s;e &s;ons, in times we well remember, have fought the battles of their country, will, by no means, in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, forget the purpo&s;es of its creation.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, Sirs, conformably to the &s;pirit of our mini&s;try, we wi&s;h you to con&s;ider tho&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="035443_0018_1004C9FB47115F38">
arms, as the &s;ad emblems of an unnatural and de|praved &s;tate of &s;ociety. Under this impre&s;&s;ion, you will bear them not with pride, but reluctance, and will con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;ity of their a&s;&s;umption as a &s;ource of humiliation, and not of glory, to you in common with our kind. Hence, let your ambition direct it&s;elf to the attainment and exer|ci&s;e of that piety, which we preach, and which, when univer&s;ally practi&s;ed, will render your ord|nance needle&s;s, and re&s;tore the order of our earth. You will thus be our permanent honour, as well as pre&s;ent defence. Your contemporaries will equal|ly &s;eek your virtues as their model, and your &s;tandard as their protection. And, having lived with <HI>the prai&s;es of God in your mouths, and the &s;word in your hands,</HI> a ju&s;t and grateful po&s;terity &s;hall in|&s;cribe upon your tombs, The&s;e are the men who died for their country.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our military brethren form not the only cla&s;s, to which the &s;ubject applies it&s;elf. On the duties of piety, it addre&s;&s;es a meek, but &s;olemn, le&s;&s;on to all our fellow-citizens. The rulers of France have not only &s;ought the wreck of civil &s;o|ciety, but of the moral world. After profaning the temples in Europe, they have come hither al&s;o with their &s;acrilege. On this &s;ide the Atlantick they have brought their artillery of de&s;truction to the &s;oul, their books, principles, vices. This is the cruel war they levy upon our churches, our religion, our Saviour, and our God. The&s;e are the weap|ons, wherewith they attack our families, our clo&s;|ets, our very bo&s;oms; &s;eeking to de&s;poil us of the dear hope of immortality, and to darken that heav|enly

&s;plendour, which hath irradiated the pri&s;on of death.</P>
<P>Happy for our country, had this war upon our worthie&s;t affections and hopes been as &s;ucce&s;&s;le&s;s, as that upon our civil privileges! The fact is other|wi&s;e. Chri&s;tians, you &s;ee its ravages in that dere|liction of moral obligation, which characterizes a part of our citizens. Sabbatical in&s;titutions, who&s;e ob&s;ervance was once the prai&s;e of our coun|try, have, in many places, received a wound, which will bleed before the eyes of all the pre&s;ent gene|ration. The hou&s;es of publick wor&s;hip, venerable from their appropriation, and endeared to our feelings from the con&s;tant vi&s;its of our pious an|ce&s;tors, begin to be neglected, and the holy pre|cepts of pure chri&s;tianity to be contemned. Par|ticularly do you &s;ee the triumphs of Gallick infi|delity in that factious and di&s;organizing &s;pirit, which has &s;talked through the United States for the purpo&s;e of de&s;troying our confidence in the of|ficers of the Federal government, and of under|mining the government it&s;elf. For &s;till we are obliged to a&s;&s;ert the connexion between religious rituals, and the life of liberty. Our enemy well knows, that the <HI>amiable tabernacles of the Lord of ho&s;ts</HI> are the only &s;anctuary of the people's rights; that chri&s;tianity is the very temple of freedom; and that the de&s;poti&s;m he adores cannot exi&s;t with <HI>the high prai&s;es of God.</HI> It is therefore he meets us on our &s;acred ground. It is thence he aims at us his deadly weapons, <HI>weapons, not</HI> indeed <HI>carnal, but mighty through</HI> a vain philo&s;ophy, <HI>to the pulling down of the &s;trong holds</HI> of virtue, <HI>ca&s;ting down</HI> princi|ples
<PB N="22" REF="035443_0020_1004CA014F764850">
of piety, <HI>and every thing that exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t</HI> di&s;order, <HI>and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of</HI> the devil.</P>
<P>Whoever, hence, in this war with athei&s;ts, will acknowledge the being, and celebrate the perfec|tions, of God, is a real patriot; and who, in this conte&s;t with infidels, will be <HI>a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;hall have the honour of warring for his country. Here is a warfare, Americans, in which we all may engage advantageou&s;ly; &s;o ea&s;ily main|tained, as to admit recruits without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex, and yet &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, as that, without its &s;upport, all other means of defence are nuga|tory.</P>
<P>In vain is it for you, legi&s;lators, to levy taxes, and e&s;tabli&s;h armies, for the &s;afety of the republick, if we, the &s;ubjects, by our luxuries and &s;loth, con|&s;ume the political body.</P>
<P>Vain is it for you, faithful &s;oldiers, to hazard your lives in the field, whil&s;t we, the citizens, by our di&s;union at home, act in union with the enemy.</P>
<P>And ye mini&s;ters of religion, you may as well keep clo&s;ed, as open, your churches, if we, your pretended hearers, expend that day in &s;cenes of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, which is con&s;ecrated to religious improvement. It is no longer needful for you to teach us the divine philo&s;ophy of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, your ma&s;ter, which was de&s;igned to make us the happy citizens of both earth and heaven, if we &s;uffer the Voltaires and Volneys of our age to de&s;troy our u&s;efulne&s;s in this world, and to terminate our hopes at the &s;epulchre.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="035443_0021_1004CA04D4F1F040">
De&s;cendants of a brave and pious race, let us, therefore, univer&s;ally re&s;olve to be the defenders and &s;aviours of our country, by the devout ob&s;er|vance of religious in&s;titutions, by the practice of that per&s;onal virtue, which ennobles the human na|ture, and adorns the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, by &s;acred|ly and faithfully di&s;charging our relative duties, and by &s;eeking with a &s;teady and enlightened zeal the publick order and felicity.</P>
<P>Thus, although we may fail of conquering our earthly enemies, we yet &s;hall be victorious over foes infinitely more dangerous, I mean our vices; and though un&s;ucce&s;sful in defending the country, which gave us birth, we &s;hall, neverthele&s;s, be cer|tain of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing <HI>another and a better country, even an heavenly,</HI> where the <HI>high prai&s;es of God</HI> will <HI>be in</HI> every <HI>mouth, and</HI> the u&s;e of the <HI>&s;word</HI> will be no more known.</P>
