<BIBL>DEUTERONOMY, xxxii. 8.</BIBL>
<Q>When the Mo&s;t High divided to the nations their inheri|tance, when he &s;eparated the &s;ons of Adam, he &s;et the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of I&s;rael.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JUST thoughts of Deity are &s;ublime and exalted thoughts; &s;uch are the &s;entiments of the great legi&s;lator and judge of I&s;rael, in my text, while he has in full view the attributes and character of that being who is over all.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es had &s;een much of the glory of his Maker in Egypt, at the red &s;ea, in the Arabian de&s;erts, e&s;|pecially on Mount Sinai, where his infinite maje&s;ty, his awful and endearing glories, beamed forth con|&s;picuous in giving the law. More was then &s;een of God than ever had been &s;een before.</P>
<P>This great man having &s;u&s;tained the toils and bur|dens of an eminent public &s;tation forty years; and having conducted the cho&s;en tribes to the borders of the promi&s;ed land; the divine poem out of which my text is taken, was put into his mouth, and de|&s;igned for the benefit of the people of God, in every age of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="018530_0005_0FA7B4D1EA0DA3E8">
The burden of the &s;ong is the infinite rectitude, greatne&s;s and glory of God; the exceeding depravi|ty and perver&s;ene&s;s of &s;inful man, the wi&s;dom and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of obedience, and the folly and mi&s;ery of rebellion again&s;t heaven.</P>
<P>In the fourth ver&s;e the prophet &s;peaks of the eter|nal Being in mo&s;t becoming language. "He is a rock, his work is perfect, all his ways are judgment, a God of truth, without iniquity, ju&s;t and right is he."</P>
<P>And in my text three points of doctrine meet our view, and demand our &s;erious attention.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. All nations of the earth are at the ab&s;olute di&s;|po&s;al of the Mo&s;t High, to be divided and &s;eparat|ed at his plea&s;ure.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. His expre&s;s will that mankind &s;hould live on equal terms, as brethren.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. That all the nations of the earth &s;hall be &s;ub|&s;ervient to his own peculiar nation and kingdom.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The&s;e thoughts, with their application, may im|prove the pre&s;ent hour.</P>
<P>I. All nations of the earth are at the ab&s;olute di&s;|po&s;al of the Mo&s;t High.</P>
<P>"When the Mo&s;t High divided to the nations their inheritance." Here God appears inhabiting eternity, and having in his own infinite mind a mo&s;t glorious and perfect plan, relating to all the future inhabitants of the world; the &s;ituation, numbers,
<PB N="7" REF="018530_0006_0FA7B4D2A8F06478">
ri&s;e and fall, of the various &s;tates and empires that were to over&s;pread the earth.</P>
<P>God determined all the&s;e things, in his boundle&s;s wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, before he began to operate in his providence; that point in the va&s;t round of eter|nity cannot be conceived of, when he had not &s;o de|creed.</P>
<P>He &s;aw all his works, and all the works and ways of men, the whole bu&s;ine&s;s and re&s;ult of the world, as clearly before he began to create, as he will at the con&s;ummation of all things.</P>
<P>What God has determined <HI>&s;hall be done,</HI> is often in &s;acred &s;cripture, &s;poken of in a pa&s;t ten&s;e, <HI>as already done;</HI> in&s;tances in the prophets are many; and the manner of expre&s;&s;ion is de&s;igned to impre&s;s our minds with a &s;en&s;e of the divine immutability.&mdash;"My coun|&s;el &s;hall &s;tand and I will do all my plea&s;ure." "He ruleth in the armies of heaven, and among the inha|bitants of the world, and none can &s;tay his hand."</P>
<P>What is pa&s;t we all know to be certain, and what God has determined and foreknown is equally cer|tain. So when future &s;cenes of glory and ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s to mankind, were opened to &s;aint John, &s;cenes that require many ages for their accompli&s;hment, he that &s;at on the throne &s;aid, "<HI>It is done:</HI> I am alpha and omega, the begining and the end."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>If any &s;tumble at this part of the divine charac|ter, let them remember <HI>God is incomprehen&s;ible:</HI> if any would thence infer that there is no freedom of will, or moral agency in men; no de&s;ert of prai&s;e or blame;
<PB N="8" REF="018530_0007_0FA7B4D36BF24A38">
let them look into their own bo&s;oms, and con&s;ult the certain feelings of their own hearts.</P>
<P>The divine decrees and certain foreknowledge, are nece&s;&s;ary to the perfection of Deity, and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the entire freedom and moral agency of intelligent creatures; and if men or angels can|not explain all that is connected with the&s;e doctrines, it only verifies that we cannot "by &s;earching find out God, or the Almighty unto perfection." We know not what it is to be God, to think as God thinks and decree as he decrees.</P>
<P>The divine Being in his wi&s;e fixed purpo&s;e, "di|vided to the nations their inheritance, and &s;eparated the &s;ons of Adam," long "before he had formed the earth or the &s;ea or the highe&s;t part of the du&s;t of the world."</P>
<P>But before the days of Mo&s;es he had in part un|folded his infinitely wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es, in the movements of his Providence. The world was crea|ted and the human kind to repleni&s;h it: The garden of Eden was given to them as their inheritance in the days of innocence but for rebellion again&s;t heaven they were &s;oon turned out of it.</P>
<P>Nothing but &s;acred hi&s;tory looks back to this ear|ly period, there we find mankind multiplied and &s;pread abroad on the earth, in how many tribes or nations we are not informed; but may argue from the long period of time before the flood, about &s;even|teen hundred years: And the longevity of the peo|ple, that a great part of the world might be inhabited.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="018530_0008_0FA7B4D44F28DFE8">
No doubt the numerous children of Adam were before the flood &s;eparated in many divi&s;ions and di|lated far and wide on the face of the earth.</P>
<P>After the deluge we find the &s;mall remains of man|kind on the mountains of Ararat, which divide the pre&s;ent empire of Per&s;ia from Circa&s;&s;ian Tartary, on the north: whence they fir&s;t moved &s;outh-ea&s;t and lived together in one growing family or tribe about an hundred years.&mdash;From whence they journeyed we&s;tward as far as the river Euphrates; near the place where the garden of Eden was &s;ituate, in que&s;t, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, of the ancient paradi&s;e, but found it was wholly demoli&s;hed by the flood. Yet vainly fond to build &s;omething in imitation of it. They had al&s;o the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition natural to the nations ever &s;ince, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to hold together as long as po&s;&s;ible and extend one general empire: But he who &s;aw fit to &s;eparate the &s;ons of Adam, laid the grand founda|tion of it, in his Providence, at this time.</P>
<P>For while, on the plains of Babel, they were at|tempting to "build a city and a tower who&s;e top might reach to heaven" the Almighty confounded their language.</P>
<P>The language of paradi&s;e, and that &s;poken by God's covenant people to this day, was in all proba|bility the Hebrew tongue: But now the Almighty wholly obliterated from the minds and memories of mo&s;t of them, that ancient language, leaving only one divi&s;ion of the people to retain it, and impre&s;&s;ed on the minds of all the other divi&s;ions re&s;pectively, a different dialect, which each immediately &s;poke with the &s;ame freedom, with which they before &s;poke their native tongue.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="018530_0009_0FA7B4D5AF1730E8">
How many different languages were now given we are not told, nor how many di&s;tinct nations or tribes were made in con&s;equence; God meant it to "&s;eparate the &s;ons of Adam<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xi.</NOTE>" and they were &s;cattered abroad on all the face of the earth.</P>
<P>All the languages now in the world were radically contained in the various dialects which God then gave on the plains of Shinar; though with much compo&s;ition and variation; as no man ever invented a language entirely new, this &s;eems the prerogative of God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>And the Mo&s;t High in rolling on his purpo&s;es, has, in every age, made u&s;e of this as one great medium, even diver&s;ity of language, to make or keep the na|tions di&s;tinct and &s;eparate.</P>
<P>But to proceed, infinite Wi&s;dom has many other means, which all co-operate for the &s;ame end.</P>
<P>The enormous growth and extent of nations, and empires, has often brought them to divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>So the va&s;t extended empires of Greece and Rome, after covering a great part of the world, broke to pieces under their own weight.</P>
<P>Again God has often made this the event of war foreign or inte&s;tine, and many new nations have ro&s;e out of blood.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, a tyrannical and oppre&s;&s;ive &s;pirit in poten|tates and rulers has often had the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="018530_0010_0FA7B4D6CE1168F0">
The&s;e have made many people &s;o unea&s;y as to throw off the yoke of &s;ubjection, and &s;et up di&s;tinct by them&s;elves. Witne&s;s Egypt, in ancient days; the cruel tyranny of the Monarch lo&s;t him the be&s;t part of his &s;ubjects, the people of God, the many thou&s;ands of I&s;rael. God's purpo&s;e was fulfilled, as in all things; but the tyranny of Pharaoh was the means.</P>
<P>Witne&s;s al&s;o the de&s;potic language of that unexpe|rienced young Prince in I&s;rael: No &s;ooner had be an&s;wered the &s;upplicating tribes "my little finger &s;hall be thicker than my father's loins" than a grand divi&s;ion in the nation took place.</P>
<P>Many examples might be adduced; but we have a recent one almo&s;t without a parrallel. How well connected and quiet was the great Briti&s;h empire, from the acce&s;&s;ion of the Prince of Orange, till af|ter the death of George the &s;econd? and how did every branch of the empire dread the thought of di&s;union? But, when a Briti&s;h King became a ty|rant, and the Parliament a band of de&s;pots, and would be content with nothing le&s;s than to bind a great part of the empire in chains of perpetual &s;lavery, yea, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever; when they cau&s;ed the &s;ea and the waves along our coa&s;t to roar with their ho&s;tile thunder, and our defencele&s;s towns to flame to the mid&s;t of heaven. When they plunged their daggers in the brea&s;ts of an innocent people, and cal|led upon us the &s;avages of the wilderne&s;s, with all their infernal ma&s;&s;acres, our feelings were greatly changed. We once loved Britain mo&s;t dearly; but <HI>Britain the Tyrant,</HI> we could not love; our &s;ouls ab|horred
<PB N="12" REF="018530_0011_0FA7B4D7326058D8">
her mea&s;ures; when matters were pu&s;hed thus far, we de&s;i&s;ted from all our humble prayers to deaf ears and unrelenting &s;ouls. We ro&s;e from the du&s;t where we had been long pro&s;trate&mdash;our brea&s;ts glowed with noble ardor&mdash;we invoked the God of our fathers, and we took the field; and we have found that "there is none like the God of Je&s;urun who hath rode on the heavens in our help and in his excellency on the &s;ky."</P>
<P>And yet further; God has often made the lawle&s;s ambition, and proud a&s;piring &s;pirit of men in&s;tru|mental of making new kingdoms, or dividing anci|ent ones. As in the ca&s;e of Nimrod, a proud and lawle&s;s man; a man of blood <HI>in contempt of heaven, "a mighty hunter before the Lord</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. x.</NOTE>," he &s;oon began a kingdom di&s;tinct for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The proud &s;pirit of Jeroboam contributed to the &s;ame end, in conjunction with the ra&s;hne&s;s of the young king and his raw coun&s;ellors.</P>
<P>Moreover, pro&s;pects of gain and worldly advanta|ges, have often laid the foundation of future empire. With the&s;e views many times a few adventrous peo|ple have emigrated from their native land, and when &s;ucce&s;s has crowned their exertions, and they have &s;o increa&s;ed in numbers and wealth, and become &s;o &s;a|voured with learning, as to be fit for a di&s;tinct em|pire, the event has &s;eldom long delayed.</P>
<P>And, indeed, there is the &s;ame rea&s;on, and it is equally the de&s;ign of divine providence, that when any people become adult&mdash;are ble&s;&s;ed with numbers,
<PB N="13" REF="018530_0012_0FA7B4D7E88E5300">
wealth, knowledge, and in all regards equal to the management of national affairs, they &s;hould then be|come di&s;tinct and independent, as that the branches of a family &s;hould be &s;o, when adult and capable to manage for them&s;elves. Succe&s;sful emigrations are the &s;eeds of future empire.</P>
<P>Add to all the&s;e religious per&s;ecution, which God has made in&s;trumental of new &s;tates and empires. Tho&s;e who have true religion, prize it far above all &s;ublunary enjoyments; the rights of con&s;cience they hold as their deare&s;t rights; and when they are per|&s;ecuted and may not enjoy the wor&s;hip and ordinan|ces of God, as they judge agreeable to his will, they will combine and defend them&s;elves, if in their power, and have a commonwealth of their own, and rulers of their own &s;pirit and principles. Witne&s;s the uni|ted Netherlands. What floods of trouble and blood did they wade through, much actuated by a &s;acred regard to the rights of con&s;cience. The great em|pire of Spain was divided in con&s;equence, and the United Provinces a&s;&s;umed &s;overeign power, with the mo&s;t happy con&s;titution, perhaps, then in the world.</P>
<P>This hateful per&s;ecution led the way to all the growing greatne&s;s of the United States of America. The &s;ufferings of our progenitors, many and great, for their religion and &s;trict piety, impelled them to for&s;ake their native land, and all the affluence they enjoyed there; they preferred a wa&s;te, howling wil|derne&s;s, with their God, and his ordinances unpol|luted, to all the wealth and &s;plendor of their native Albion. The God whom they &s;erved for&s;ook them not; he commanded the deep in their favour, and guarded them from the power of the numerous hea|then
<PB N="14" REF="018530_0013_0FA7B4D909339358">
then &s;avages: they made him the glory in the mid&s;t of them, and he was a wall of fire round about them. "The wilderne&s;s and the &s;olitary place was glad for them, and the de&s;ert rejoiced and blo&s;&s;omed as the ro&s;e."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xxxv.</NOTE></P>
<P>Con&s;idered as a people, the&s;e were the days of our early youth; and in all the great things God has done for us of late, he has remembered us "the kindne&s;s of our youth, and the love of our e&s;pou&s;als, when we went after him in the wilderne&s;s, in a land not &s;own."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. ii.</NOTE></P>
<P>By the&s;e, and the like means, the Mo&s;t High has thus far effected his purpo&s;e, and thus all the nume|rous nations of the earth have been formed:&mdash;the temper and the exertions of men concerned, have been, in many in&s;tances, very wicked; but God is holy and pure; and when we behold Jehovah tak|ing occa&s;ion from the wickedne&s;s of men, to accom|pli&s;h his own mo&s;t glorious purpo&s;es, and di&s;play his own character, in the mo&s;t amiable and a&s;toni&s;hing view, who &s;hall not adore him!</P>
<P>II. We next take notice of the manife&s;t will of heaven, that mankind &s;hould live on equal terms as brethren.</P>
<P>This is fully intimated in two expre&s;&s;ions in the text, the fir&s;t is, <HI>"their inheritance."</HI> Here we be|hold Deity as univer&s;al parent giving portions to his children: He is ab&s;olute proprietor, has whatever he plea&s;es to give, and imparts to his great family ac|cording to his &s;overeign good will: What he gives to each nation in the cour&s;e of his providence is e|qually
<PB N="15" REF="018530_0014_0FA7B4D99432E9E8">
theirs re&s;pectively, and each individual has his property alike confirmed by the father of all.</P>
<P>An empire, or commonwealth newly formed, hath its own inheritance, all its rights and privileges, as firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed as the mo&s;t ancient empire in the world. The inheritance of a &s;mall nation is as tru|ly theirs as that of a great one.</P>
<P>The power there is in great and war-like nations to plunder and de&s;troy tho&s;e that are weak and &s;mall, gives them no more right &s;o to do, than the wealth of the rich gives them right to oppre&s;s and &s;wallow up the poor that are about them.</P>
<P>Potentates who have, in their ambition, pride, and other lu&s;ts, robbed many millions of their &s;ub&s;tance, in former and later ages, and &s;laughtered millions more, becau&s;e it was in their power, have been the mo&s;t atrocious murderers, the mo&s;t execrable rob|bers, and the mo&s;t horrid wretches that ever di&s;grac|ed human nature.</P>
<P>The other expre&s;&s;ion in the text which I have al|luded to is this, <HI>"the &s;ons of Adam,"</HI> all near kin|dred, of one common nature, children of one father. The Apo&s;tle &s;eems to comment on this when he &s;ays, God "hath made of one blood, all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath de|termined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Human nature has one common feeling of plea|&s;ure and pain, wants and nece&s;&s;ities, &s;orrows and troubles are common, all have a quick &s;en&s;e of inju|ry and abu&s;e, all rejoice in kindne&s;s received.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="018530_0015_0FA7B4DC4FE2F4A0">
Tyrants bent on &s;laughter and the mi&s;ery of man|kind, ought to realize that the multitudes they rob and murder, feel plunder and death ju&s;t as they them|&s;elves would were it their woful lot to fall into &s;uch mercile&s;s hands.</P>
<P><HI>"Separated the &s;ons of Adam."</HI> Here the branch|ing out of nations, is repre&s;ented under the idea of the branching out of families; and as an aged pa|rent who is ble&s;&s;ed with a number of families, formed out of his own hou&s;e, calls them all his children, and looks on the whole only as his own family &s;till, tho' di&s;per&s;ed in &s;everal branches. So, in very deed the whole world is but one complicated family.</P>
<P>No parents are &s;o unnatural as to be willing that one of their hou&s;hold &s;hould be tyrant and de&s;pot over the whole, to vex, oppre&s;s, and &s;laughter the re&s;t at his plea&s;ure; or that the &s;tronger children &s;hould be cruel to the weaker.</P>
<P>Had Adam &s;een all of this kind that has &s;ince fallen out in his family, he would have wept more bitterly than the poet feigns, when he &s;aw the Lazar hou&s;e, with all its dreadful &s;tores of complicated mi&s;ery,
<Q><L>Sight &s;o deform what heart of rock could long</L>
<L>Dry-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept,</L>
<L>Though not of woman born; compa&s;&s;ion quell'd</L>
<L>His be&s;t of man, and gave him up to tears.</L>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>As individuals and families are brethren and neighbours to each other, &s;o are &s;ocieties, towns, &s;tates and nations, and &s;hould always act the frater|nal part, and the neighbour, with that amiable &s;pi|rit which Je&s;us de&s;cribes in his parable of the neigh|bour<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke x.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="018530_0016_0FA7B4DD9A85C798">
All are under that divine precept "what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o to them, for this is the law and the prophets."</P>
<P>It is the law of rea&s;on, the law of nature, and in-forced by the whole of divine revelation.</P>
<P>However mankind have lo&s;t a &s;pirit of love, and whatever hatred they often have to one another; yet they are all very near kindred; and the great pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, who is love "&s;ees and abhors them, becau&s;e of the provoking of his &s;ons and his daughters."</P>
<P>There has never been any intermarriage from without the family of Adam, to divide the blood, and make the kindred more di&s;tant; the family is now very great, it has many branches, but it is &s;till one, it remains the &s;ame; and if we do not feel our connection with all the human kind to be very near, very tender, we are pa&s;t feeling, and our &s;pirit is op|po&s;ite to nature, to rea&s;on, and to our common fa|ther, the fountain of love.</P>
<P>And here again the horrors of wanton, offen&s;ive war appear in their proper colour. It is only Cain murdering Abel his brother.</P>
<P>In this men &s;in more again&s;t nature than ever a|po&s;tate angels did. Well might the poet exclaim,
<Q><L>Oh! Shame to men: devil with devil damn'd</L>
<L>Firm concord hold: men only di&s;agree.</L>
<L>They live in hatred, enmity and &s;trife,</L>

<P>III. The divine determination, which &s;hall not be fru&s;trated, to make all nations &s;ub&s;ervient to God's own peculiar nation and kingdom.</P>
<P>"He &s;et the bounds of the people, according to the number of the children of I&s;rael."</P>
<P>Whatever more immediate, or &s;pecial reference this may have to the &s;ituation of the &s;even nations of Canaan, and adjacent kingdoms, yet no doubt the words have that exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e I have intimated; the phra&s;es are wholly indefinite, <HI>the nations&mdash;the peo|ple&mdash;the &s;ons of Adam</HI>&mdash;and the whole analogy of &s;crip|ture warrants the idea.</P>
<P>God, from eternity, in his mo&s;t glorious plan, his infinitely kind decree; &s;et the bounds of all nations, with a mo&s;t tender regard to his own covenant peo|ple, in every age, wherever they might dwell, or whatever their number might be; and in his al|mighty Providence carries the whole into effect.</P>
<P>There are many phra&s;es in &s;acred &s;cripture which denote the covenant people of God, in one age of the world, as well as in another: In the&s;e, and in future days as well as in ages pa&s;t. <HI>Zion, Jeru&s;alem, the &s;eed of Abraham, the &s;eed of Jacob, the children of I&s;rael,</HI> and the like, are expre&s;&s;ions well known of this import. <HI>The children of I&s;rael</HI> are the church, the people of God in every age.</P>
<P>Were it not for the concerns of religion and im|mortal happine&s;s, there would be nothing worthy of God, as the author and di&s;po&s;er, in the creation of
<PB N="19" REF="018530_0018_0FA7B4DF6E8CEA78">
the world, or in the kingdom of providence. Sepa|rate from any connection with eternal glory, all the mighty movements, and all the glory of the kingdoms of this world are but &s;olemn trifles: But in this con|nection of great importance.</P>
<P>Immortal happine&s;s is for immortal &s;ouls, and not creatures but God him&s;elf is their portion Among the covenant people of God, the way of happine&s;s is di&s;played, and God exalted in the glory of his grace,</P>
<P>So we find that king that God has &s;et on his holy hill of Zion reigning for his church, "Far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world but al&s;o in that which is to come: And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church, which is his body, the ful|ne&s;s of him that filleth all in all<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. i.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>In the context we find "the Lord's portion is his people, Jacob is the lot of his inheritance." So God &s;ays "I gave Egypt for thy ran&s;om, Ethiopia and Seba for thee," and &s;peaking of Zion "all my &s;prings are in thee."</P>
<P>The affairs of the world, in every empire, every place, will finally re&s;ult in this, "be &s;till and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in all the earth."</P>
<P>Much of the divine conduct in the kingdom of providence is not to be inve&s;tigated by man: Yet we can ea&s;ily &s;ee enough to illu&s;trate the point now
<PB N="20" REF="018530_0019_0FA7B4E047A50418">
in view; want of time forbids my giving many in|&s;tances; let a few &s;uffice as a &s;pecimen of the whole.</P>
<P>Look back into Egypt in the days of Jacob, and &s;ucceeding ages. God had &s;et their bounds not far from Canaan where Jacob dwelt: He had made Egypt in tho&s;e days &s;uperior to any other empire in the world, for power, wealth, arts and &s;ciences. And this with de&s;ign that they &s;hould be an a&s;&s;ylum for his covenant people: That there they might be fed in days of famine, and might greatly increa&s;e. The great learning of Egypt was for the education of Mo&s;es, that he might well &s;u&s;tain the important character afterwards devolved on him. Aaron and other leaders, yea the whole people of God, no doubt, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> much the better for the many &s;chools and the learning of Egypt, to &s;u&s;tain their re&s;pective charac|ters in the great &s;cenes that were before them. Even the gold of the nation was laid on the tabernacle of the Mo&s;t High. Their great kindne&s;s to I&s;rael, for a time, and their hard dealing afterwards, con&s;pired to advance the intere&s;t of the people of God. Again,</P>
<P>The nations &s;ituate between Egypt and Canaan, in the way that I&s;rael took, had their bounds for the &s;ame end. "He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation." When the ho&s;ts of I&s;rael came out of Egypt they were not acquainted with war; nor had they in&s;truments of war, &s;ufficient to encounter the mighty nations of Canaan; but by fighting their way through &s;maller oppo&s;ition, conquering the Amorites and the people of Ba&s;han with their kings, and breaking through other ho&s;tile re&s;i&s;tance, they became expert in war,
<PB N="21" REF="018530_0020_0FA7B4E0EEF777D0">
and well equipped with &s;words and bows, helmets, &s;pears and &s;hields taken from their enemies.</P>
<P>The&s;e manoeuvres made Jo&s;hua a great general, and taught the whole army of I&s;rael all military at|chievements, and &s;o prepared them to face all the mighty warriors of Canaan in due time, with all the gigantic &s;ons of Anak in their front.</P>
<P>There were many and great miracles we know, in conducting the people of God to the land of promi&s;e and their &s;ettlement there; but all that might be done for them in the common cour&s;e of Providence was done in that way: Thus God has ever dealt and ever will.</P>
<P>We may look next into the land of Canaan, and we &s;hall find the Mo&s;t High planted and &s;upported &s;even nations there, to cultivate the land and prepare it for his own people, that they might find it a land flowing with milk and honey, and very commodious for their re&s;idence. The pious governor of Judea &s;peaking of this, &s;ays, "They took &s;trong cities and a fat land, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed hou&s;es full of all goods, wells dig|ged, vineyards and oliveyards, and all fruit-trees in abundance, &s;o they did eat, and were filled, and be|came fat, and delighted them&s;elves in thy great good|ne&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Neh. ix. 25.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>In the days of David, what va&s;t territory round about had the nations cultivated and made fertile, which that great warrior, at the command of God, brought into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of I&s;rael?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="018530_0021_0FA7B4E1F6792120">
In the days of Solomon, how did the nations of the ea&s;t &s;ubmit and mini&s;ter to the people of God?</P>
<P>They have al&s;o had protection whence it was not expected. "Let mine out-ca&s;ts dwell with thee, Moab, be thou a covert to them, from the face of the &s;poile<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xvi. 4.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>The va&s;t Per&s;ian empire, with Cyrus their re|nowned prince and general were for the &s;ame end. Per&s;ia was then mi&s;tre&s;s of the world, and Cyrus the greate&s;t general in it; all for the people of God, "to &s;ay to the pri&s;oners go forth, and to them that &s;it in darkne&s;s &s;hew your&s;elves." In this way the church of God was delivered from her Babylonian captivity. And &s;ome of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors did much for their re&s;ettlement in the holy land.</P>
<P>The growing greatne&s;s of the Grecian empire, in the days of Philip, and more e&s;pecially in the time of his &s;on Alexander, was ordered in Providence with the &s;ame view to favour the cau&s;e of religion, and prepare the way for a wide &s;pread of divine knowledge. A great part of the world then received law from the Greeks and al&s;o their language; a &s;olemn, elegant and copious tongue, mo&s;t fit for the promulgation of the New Te&s;tament. This language was exten|&s;ive among the nations when the evangeli&s;ts and apo&s;tles wrote. And had it not been for a di&s;pen&s;a|tion of Providence of this kind, it had been impo&s;&s;i|ble, without mere miracles, that the New Te&s;tament &s;hould have been, in any mea&s;ure, &s;o exten&s;ively read as it was, at the time of its fir&s;t promulgation.</P>

The greatne&s;s of the Roman empire when the Mo&s;t High placed Con&s;tantine at the head of it, is another proof of his regard to his own people; great, very great, were the privileges they enjoyed in the days of that monarch. Though alas in their abun|dant favours they &s;oon after waxed wanton and apo&s;tatized from the way of holine&s;s.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing over many examples, I &s;hall add but one more &s;o con&s;picuous, indeed, that we mu&s;t not be inattentive to it. I mean the great monarchy of France, great in wealth, power, numbers, and learn|ing. Great and much honoured in the prince that now &s;its on the throne: All this indeed to protect the rights of mankind, to patronize liberty, and &s;erve the cau&s;e of religion in &s;uch a day as this. Not only to divide to us our inheritance and &s;eparate us from the re&s;t of the &s;ons of Adam, but to promote the glorious cau&s;e of liberty and religion among the nations.</P>
<P>In the&s;e in&s;tances and many more that I would name, would the time admit, we can clearly &s;ee the ways of divine Providence, and inve&s;tigate the foot|&s;teps of the Mo&s;t High; and we may re&s;t fully a&s;|&s;ured that all other nations from the beginning to the end of the world &s;hall finally appear to have been &s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;ame glorious purpo&s;e. And when they have an&s;wered this great end they fall and ri&s;e no more; but the kingdom of God &s;tands firm on an everla&s;ting ba&s;is. As it is written, "The moth &s;hall eat them up like a garment, and the worm &s;hall eat them like wool; but my righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be for|ever, and my &s;alvation from generation to generation<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah li.</NOTE>."</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>From what has been &s;aid we learn our duty and intere&s;t as a people. We have lately received our inheritance, as a di&s;tinct &s;overeign empire, from the great di&s;po&s;er of all things, and a better God never gave to the &s;ons of Adam; a land as fertile as the land of Canaan, and of much larger extent. He hath given us the be&s;t civil con&s;titution now in the world, the &s;ame in the general nature of it, with that he gave to I&s;rael in the days of Mo&s;es. And it is remarkable that our number of people is about the &s;ame with their's in the days of Mo&s;es&mdash;i. e. about three millions. I&s;rael had thirteen free inde|pendent &s;tates, or tribes, one of them, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that of Jo&s;eph being &s;ubdivided: out of the&s;e &s;tates their &s;u|preme Council or general Congre&s;s was cho&s;en, by delegates from each, often called their Sanhedrim. Each &s;tate managed its own internal police, each had a General A&s;&s;embly, compo&s;ed of their be&s;t men, at the free election of the people, often called the elders of the tribe: their government was theocratical; &s;o for &s;ub&s;tance is our free elective government, acording to that old maxim, <HI>vox populi vox dei.</HI> And they had their executive courts and officers in various &s;tations, for &s;ub&s;tance an&s;wering to ours. No matter for the difference of names, titles and phra&s;es, where the &s;ub&s;tance of things is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>We may well argue from the wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s of God, that this general plan of government is the mo&s;t perfect, and be&s;t for men, as God him&s;elf de|vi&s;ed it and gave it in the greatne&s;s of his love, to his own peculiar people. Had any other been bet|ter in the nature of things, God would have given
<PB N="25" REF="018530_0024_0FA7B4E689835D20">
them a different one. So when they rejected it for monarchy, they rejected the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God, and were great loo&s;ers. They had the light of divine revelation; we in a far more glorious man|ner. Canaan was their inheritance, Columbia is ours; and our &s;outhern dominions cover the &s;ame climate in which they dwelt.</P>
<P>Now our great duty and intere&s;t is to &s;ecure and improve our ble&s;&s;ed inheritance, and hand it down to po&s;terity. There is but one way to do this, and that is to keep the commandments of our God. This will &s;ecure to us every ble&s;&s;ing, and make us "high above all nations,"&mdash;"great in name, in prai&s;e and in honor;" but if we rebel again&s;t God we &s;hall be mi&s;erable. We mu&s;t, above all things, attend to true religion, and practi&s;e every moral virtue, even that righteou&s;ne&s;s that exalteth a nation, and fly from every vice and abhor the ways of immorality.</P>
<P>Our danger at this day lies in that &s;hameful irreli|gious temper that is too obvious in many&mdash;a man that contemns true religion is a di&s;grace to human nature and a great cur&s;e to his country. We are en|dangered by many vices&mdash;inju&s;tice and extortion, idlene&s;s and luxury, prophane &s;wearing, the &s;ure mark of a thoughtle&s;s &s;inner; prophanation of the holy &s;abbath, intemperance, la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s and wantonne&s;s, pride and extravagance, the Lord in his infinite mer|cy deliver us from all the&s;e.</P>
<P>But there is one abominable vice that is &s;o perni|cious to us every day, and &s;o immediately threatens us with di&s;&s;olution and anarchy, that I mu&s;t bear my te&s;timony more largely again&s;t it.</P>

It is that unrea&s;onable, raging &s;pirit of jealou&s;y pointed again&s;t all in power, e&s;pecially again&s;t tho&s;e in the mo&s;t burden&s;ome and important tru&s;ts. Jea|lou&s;y is the rage and di&s;traction of men, as well in civil as dome&s;tic life. We elect all our rulers, and often enough in all rea&s;on: we choo&s;e &s;uch as we e&s;teem men of the greate&s;t wi&s;dom and probity: we have no jealou&s;y of them until we exalt them into of|fice, and burden them with a great weight; then we turn jealous; for no rea&s;on but becau&s;e they are ex|erting all their wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s to pour out ble&s;&s;ings upon us, and &s;acrificing their lives to make us happy. They are as good men after they are in office as before, but we have a very different &s;pirit towards them. Nay, &s;ome are not a&s;hamed openly to &s;ay, we ought to, we mu&s;t keep a jealous eye over our rulers in every &s;tation in order to &s;ecure our privileges; which, by the way, is ju&s;t as good &s;en&s;e as to &s;ay that a woman ought to be very jealous of her hu&s;band, that &s;o &s;he may live happily with him, and all dome&s;tic concerns may go on in peace.</P>
<P>Our rulers in every &s;tation, are open and account|able to their con&s;tituents in all they do; and if cri|minal, are &s;ubject to law and puni&s;hment, even as any private man, and we may turn them out of of|fice when we plea&s;e. But &s;till the people will in|&s;pect them <HI>with a jealous mind,</HI> and the certain con|&s;equence is, they judge very fal&s;ely and abu&s;ively of them.</P>
<P>A man under the force of jealou&s;y, never yet judg|ed right in any ca&s;e, and never can. Jealou&s;y will &s;oon find enough in the mo&s;t perfect character in the world to make it a very bad one. That old poet who &s;o greatly excelled in his di&s;cernment of human nature, has told us the very truth.</P>

<P>Jealou&s;y makes men unea&s;y with the be&s;t admi|ni&s;tration, and with the be&s;t men at the head of it; unea&s;y with all their rulers do, and they will &s;tone for a good deed as &s;oon as for a bad one. It makes men rebellious, ob&s;tinate and heady, and ob&s;tructs a multitude of ble&s;&s;ings which good rulers are pouring down on the people they love.</P>
<P>We expend much to maintain authority, as indeed they ought to have an honorable &s;upport; and would we only let them do us all the good in their hearts, and in their power under God, they would repay us a thou&s;and fold. But what can the good patriots do? fir&s;t we mu&s;t be jealous of them, next we certainly think them wicked, and then we de&s;troy their influ|ence and their good names together. Thus we loo&s;e our benefit and our co&s;t of &s;upporting them. We bind them hand and foot, and are like a man who &s;hould hire a number of the be&s;t workmen at a great expence, to build him an hou&s;e, and as &s;oon as they began to operate with all their &s;kill and fidelity, &s;hould load them with chains,&mdash;pay might continue, but the work mu&s;t mi&s;erably proceed.</P>
<P>Let our rulers as well as others, be weighed in an even balance: jealou&s;y makes the balance very uneven: let us judge of tho&s;e in power as well as of other men, with all that charity which the Apo&s;tle de&s;cribes, and which, without &s;olid rea&s;on, <HI>"thinketh no evil."</HI></P>

But this hydra of jealou&s;y and evil &s;ur|mi&s;e, it is not liberty, it is tyranny, it is confu&s;ion, it is death. Proud, &s;elfi&s;h, wicked men take the ad|vantage of it; they lu&s;t for offices, for which they are utterly unfit; but they mu&s;t fir&s;t remove tho&s;e worthy men that hold them: they make or propagate a thou&s;and lies, to &s;tir up the jealou&s;y of the people, inrage the multitude, and clear the &s;eats of honour for them&s;elves. And when &s;uch brambles get in power, "a fire &s;oon comes out of the bramble and devours the cedars of Lebanon."</P>
<P>If this vile &s;pirit may have its full growth and univer&s;al &s;way, we &s;hall &s;oon have few men of wi&s;|dom and probity, in &s;eats of honour and tru&s;t; and the good will adopt the words of the prophet, and la|ment over our land, &s;aying "A fire is gone out of the rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, &s;o that &s;he hath no &s;trong rod to be a &s;ceptre to rule: this is a lamentation and &s;hall be for a la|mentation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xix.</NOTE>."

And &s;hall not all the goodne&s;s of God, to our fathers and to us, e&s;pecially, recent, wonderful favours lead us to repentance, and engage us to univer&s;al holine&s;s?</P>
<P>God had determined from eternity to divide us our inheritance, as he hath lately done; his Provi|dence

began to operate in the days of our fathers though they had no thought of the re&s;ult of it.</P>
<P>Thus all tho&s;e cruel per&s;ecutions that were under the kings of the Stuart family, &s;erved, in the Provi|dence of God, to bring into this land people of the be&s;t principles and morals; it is e&s;pecially true of this part of it.</P>
<P>God e&s;tabli&s;hed a glorious church in a dreary wil|derne&s;s: and tho&s;e words in the context are as ap|plicable to them as to I&s;rael of old, "He found him in a de&s;ert land, in a wa&s;te howling wilderne&s;s; he led him about, he in&s;tructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye."</P>
<P>Our fathers were men of &s;olid wi&s;dom, piety and virtue, and therefore it was their early concern to promote learning, to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;eminaries, which have been wonderfully ble&s;&s;ed for that end; to provide for the &s;upport of a learned orthodox go&s;pel mini&s;try, to guard the churches: then Mo&s;es and Aaron were brethren indeed, and they went hand in hand, "Thou ledde&s;t thy people like a flock by the hand of Mo&s;es and Aaron," our civil con&s;titution was excellent while inviolate. The people amazingly grew, in numbers, and the Mo&s;t High was their defence in all their perils: he was then laying the foundation for what we now &s;ee; and in all the movements of the great and complicated wheels of Providence, as in the high and dreadful vi&s;ion of Ezekiel the prophet, "a man, that man who is God, &s;at above upon them," rolling us into future empire.</P>
<P>With the &s;ame view, God has rai&s;ed up &s;o many &s;tate&s;men, and military commanders, and &s;o many
<PB N="30" REF="018530_0029_0FA7B4EAD056D4B0">
renowned pillars in &s;acred characters. And as the time of &s;eparation drew near, a &s;pirit of learning, liberty, and a martial &s;pirit greatly increa&s;ed. The alwi&s;e Being knew what in&s;truments would be mo&s;t proper in every department. For this end our late General was born with all his greatne&s;s of &s;oul; call|ed into military &s;ervice in the days of youth, and trained up with every noble accompli&s;hment. And the hearts of the whole nation wonderfully united in him. Divine Providence ordering all the circum|&s;tances of the late war, calls aloud upon us to love and &s;erve the great Ruler of all.</P>
<P>When our tyrannical enemies fir&s;t attacked us, it was with a force ju&s;t enough to rou&s;e and invig|orate us; but by no means equal to a conque&s;t. Had they fallen upon us, with all their might, un|armed, unprovided as we then were, what would have become of us? They pre&s;&s;ed upon us, with increa&s;ing force, ju&s;t fa&s;t enough to confirm our union and martial &s;pirit, and prepare us to give them the re|ception they de&s;erved. "Howbeit they meant not &s;o, neither did their hearts think &s;o," all this was of God.</P>
<P>The forming of the great council of our nation was indeed wonderful; our a&s;&s;ociation, bill of rights, ar|ticles of confederation, and alliance, di&s;play divine wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s; our naval atchievements, e&s;pecially when we were weake&s;t, have &s;hewn that God is mighty.</P>

died in proportion to their number, than has been u&s;ual in time of peace, notwith&s;tanding the reeking &s;word, and the horrible pri&s;on-&s;hips of our enemies. The more than ordinary fruitfulne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;ons, has, perhaps, been a counterbalance to our extraor|dinary con&s;umption, during the war. And &s;urely God has brought great good to us, out of one very great evil, faithle&s;s depreciating paper currency, in|deed one of the wor&s;t things that ever a people are &s;courged with: yet Providence has &s;o ordered, that it has an&s;wered the end of a mighty tax upon us, and has made even filthy rags a cord for the necks of our enemies.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Excellency.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We doubt not but thoughts of the greatne&s;s and glory of God, and his overruling hand in the king|dom of Providence, like tho&s;e now offered, but much better &s;ugge&s;ted in your own mind, have been your &s;upport and con&s;olation from the days of youth. More e&s;pecially when your burdens and cares have been the greate&s;t.</P>
<P>Very few men, &s;ince the world was made ever liv|ed &s;o much for the public, as you have done. After a liberal education, in early youth, your Excellency was immediately called into public office, and the burden of complicated public offices has been your lot ever &s;ince. And though it has ever been abun|dantly manife&s;t, that your Excellency never &s;ought promotion, or popular applau&s;e; but always made truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s your guide, as well when you knew it to be unpopular, as at other times: Yet he who gave all your rich endowments (and to his name alone be the prai&s;e) knew what to do with you, in his great love to his people.</P>
<P>When our late troubles began, your Excellency's lot was very &s;ingular; when to avoid perpetual
<PB N="33" REF="018530_0032_0FA7B4EED9F71458">
&s;lavery, it became nece&s;&s;ary to oppo&s;e the tyranny of Britain; your brethren in office, the other Govern|ors all for&s;ook you, but you did not for&s;ake your God and the people you loved. Your Excellency &s;tood alone, but you &s;tood firm, "The archers &s;hot at you and you was &s;orely grieved by the enemies of our peace; but your bow abode in &s;trength, and your hands were made &s;trong by the hand of the mighty God of Jacob."</P>
<P>It was not for want of the highe&s;t opinion of your Excellency's abilities and integrity, that &s;elf &s;eeking men and enemies to liberty have laboured to make you trouble: But that they knew you &s;tood firm again&s;t the mea&s;ures of all &s;uch, and was the chief &s;upport of our righteous cau&s;e, and the liber|ties of your country. I pre&s;ume your Excellency has often thought of tho&s;e words of the great Roman patriot, "Nemo his viginti annis, reipublicae ho&s;tis fuerit, qui, non eodem tempore, mihi quoque bellum ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rit."</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This is more or le&s;s the lot of all great and good men, in public character.</P>
<P>In leading us out of a provincial, into an indepen|dent &s;tate, your Excellency had the path to beat: You walked before us in a rough and rugged way; but God remembered his promi&s;e, "Thy &s;hoes &s;hall be iron and bra&s;s, and as the day is &s;o &s;hall thy &s;trength be."</P>
<P>When the wrath of a tyrant king roared again&s;t you as a lion, and your Excellency, above all, was marked out for a victim, you endured not fearing
<PB N="34" REF="018530_0033_0FA7B4EF2E6D6810">
the wrath of the king, chu&s;ing rather to &s;uffer afflic|tion with the people of God, &s;o dear to you, than to enjoy any emoluments how great &s;oever they might have been, had you, like many others &s;ought the royal favour. So long as the &s;torms beat, the thun|ders roared, the lightnings glared around your head; all the while the tempe&s;t was &s;o black and dreadful, you &s;et &s;tedfa&s;t at helm without a covert. Your Ex|cellency then, de&s;ired no man to take that &s;eat of peril: But now you have rode out the &s;torm and conducted us into the de&s;ired haven of peace, your Excellency has reque&s;ted that you may retire and a|nother take the now more peaceful &s;eat. On this I have no remark to make, it is wholly needle&s;s at pre&s;ent: The whole nation will &s;peak; po&s;terity will not be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>If we have di&s;obeyed your Excellency this once, and have not relea&s;ed you, we beg your pardon: and earne&s;tly intreat your further ble&s;&s;ings, in the character you have &s;o long &s;u&s;tained. If the people have obeyed, and have granted your Excellency re|tirement, you retire, Sir, with every po&s;&s;ible honour: And may the re&s;idue of your days be happy, and your immortality glorious!</P>
<P>And when your Excellency &s;hall be taken up from us, to &s;hine as a &s;tar of the fir&s;t magnitude, in the kingdom of your Father, forever and ever, your name &s;hall live, hi&s;toric pages will &s;hine with your deeds, and generations unborn &s;hall know you well.

The addre&s;s next turns to his honour the Lieuten|ant Governor, the Honourable A&s;&s;i&s;tant Coun&s;ellors, and the whole Venerable A&s;&s;embly of the State.</P>
<P>Venerable Fathers,</P>
<P>I &s;hall meddle with no policy, but what lies with|in my own profe&s;&s;ion, as a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s: As &s;uch, I may &s;tir up your pure minds, to attend mo&s;t zealou&s;ly, to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of all vice and im|morality, for this end let us always have, not only the be&s;t laws, but the be&s;t men to execute them, men of ability, men that pay a &s;acred regard to religion and virtue, in their own example. Your Honours will continue to be nur&s;ing fathers to the church of God, and will promote the intere&s;t of that kingdom which &s;hall finally triumph over all.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t of learning will engro&s;s your great at|tention and patronage, as it is the &s;trength and glory of a nation&mdash;what could we have done in our late conte&s;t with Britain, had we been de&s;titute of learned men? We have fought to as good purpo&s;e with the pen as with the &s;word.</P>
<P>I beg leave, earne&s;tly, to recommend the Univer|&s;ity in this State, to the intimate acquaintance and mo&s;t cordial friend&s;hip and munificence of this Hon|ourable A&s;&s;embly, it is exceeding happy when a college is embo&s;omed in the bare love and friend&s;hip of tho&s;e that are fir&s;t in the affairs of &s;tate; and when there is any di&s;tant re&s;erve between them it is very unhappy, the college &s;urely is a mo&s;t valuable inter|e&s;t and brilliant ornament to the State. Your Hon|ours &s;ee what learned and excellent in&s;tructors th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

How happy if that &s;eminary might always be embraced and nouri&s;hed by this Honourable A&s;&s;embly, as a darling child, by a kind indulgent parent? Whatever can be done to add to the &s;trength and glory of the college, will be well done: And &s;hould a liberal &s;tream of bounty flow to it, annually, out of this fountain, we &s;hould find our account in the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven on the whole State, and on our land. All inferior &s;chools in this State claim your kind notice and favour, your Honours will think upon them for good: But our great and growing unive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ity pleads for your &s;pecial intimacy and liberality, that, as times change, and nece&s;&s;ities require, nothing may be wanting to make it mo&s;t re|&s;pectable in every view, and mo&s;t u&s;eful to per&s;ons of all ranks and profe&s;&s;ions. This is an happy aera, to do every thing noble and important for &s;uch a &s;eminary.</P>
<P>Moreover, your Honours know what demands on this &s;tate, and on the nation, are ju&s;tly made, by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e who have lent us their livings to &s;upport the war, or have &s;erved an hard &s;ervice in it. You know likewi&s;e what ju&s;t obligations we are under to nations beyond the water, who have lent us their aid. Mo&s;t certainly it is high time that this &s;tate, and every &s;tate, and all in conjunction, &s;o far as demands are national, make full provi&s;ion to pay every hone&s;t debt, and till this is done public guilt lies upon us. The cries of &s;uffering, individuals from whom we with hold their bread, enter into the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth; and when foreign nations make ju&s;t de|mands,
<PB N="37" REF="018530_0036_0FA7B4F18D630C38">
we &s;hall find God will vindicate their claim. We are not poor; we are far from a &s;tate of bank|ruptcy; in a large and good land, flowing with rich trea&s;ures. Pray point out the be&s;t way and oblige us to do what is right to all men.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that have lent us their money and are now &s;uffering for want of it, are &s;ons of Adam as well as our&s;elves, and ought to live on equal terms with us, and not be wronged and oppre&s;&s;ed becau&s;e the pub|lic are many, and mighty, and can do as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have fought our battles for us are our own brethren: And even foreign nations to whom we are under ju&s;t obligations, with the other &s;tates, the whole in union, are children of our own parents. To be ju&s;t, righteous, and faithful is humanity. Righteou&s;ne&s;s is religion pure and undefiled.</P>
<P>A &s;tate or a nation ought ever to be as upright and faithful, in dealing with an individual, or a com|munity, as one neighbour with another: It lies with your Honours to concert effectual mea&s;ures, that this &s;tate, and, as far as to us appertains, the whole na|tion may be &s;o.</P>
<P>The great fountain of light, grant your Honours all wi&s;dom in this dark and trying day, &s;upport you under all your burdens and cares, make your days many, and fill them with growing u&s;efulne&s;s, in mer|cy to his people. And may we at la&s;t &s;ee you all in exalted &s;eats of glory!</P>

I next turn to my Reverend Fathers and Brethren in &s;acred character.</P>
<P>Much Honoured and dearly Beloved.</P>
<P>It is our peculiar happine&s;s, that our lives and la|bours are more immediately employed in that king|dom and intere&s;t, which is dearer to God than all things el&s;e, and to which all his other works are made &s;ub&s;ervient.</P>
<P>We have every motive to be faithful, and rejoice with exceeding joy. The kingdom of Je&s;us on earth is often not in apparent &s;plendor, or in much favour with the world; but all the concerns of it are ever moving forward, with a divine dignity, and rolling on to a mo&s;t glorious and univer&s;al triumph. Our lot in this kingdom is the happie&s;t lot. We are not indeed in the way to attain the wealth and &s;plendor and other dying allurements of this world as we might in other employments: But the very bu&s;ine&s;s of our lives is heaven upon earth; it is to conver&s;e with Deity, in all his beauty and glory, through Em|manuel, beaming forth in his word and in all his works, and to preach Deity di&s;played, God manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, to a lo&s;t world. As we love true plea&s;|ure we &s;hall be great &s;tudents, and very active for the good of immortal &s;ouls; &s;hall preach nothing but &s;ound, practical divinity, unite in go&s;pel charity, cement in love, <HI>"for God is love."</HI></P>
<P>In days like the&s;e, we are willing to bear our por|tion of expence and burden with our brethren; and truly mo&s;t of us have done that, and many of us much more: But yet we are well provided for, and
<PB N="39" REF="018530_0038_0FA7B4F5E6978C10">
ever &s;hall be; no part of the world was ever kinder to mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel than this has been from the fir&s;t. Our rulers are benevolent fathers to us; our people loving brethren and dutiful children.</P>
<P>And only to except him that is now &s;peaking, and, perhaps, a very few be&s;ide, this land has been ble&s;&s;|ed with the mo&s;t learned, orthodox, and pious cler|gy, from its fir&s;t &s;ettlement to this day, of any part of the world&punc; And we &s;ee the fruit of our labour, in re&s;i&s;ting the torrent of wickedne&s;s, which flows dread|ful from the human heart; we &s;ee good fruit when we are in&s;trumental to enlighten and regulate our people, and form them for moral and &s;ocial duties; and in all the &s;trength and &s;upport we give to the commonwealth. But above all, when God is plea&s;ed, by his holy &s;pirit, to make our labours effectual for the &s;aving good of &s;ouls; this no doubt he does in &s;ome mea&s;ure, more or le&s;s, with the labours of eve|ry true mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t. And oh! how glorious and joyful, when the divine &s;pirit is poured out in copious effu&s;ions, "as rivers in the wilderne&s;s, and as floods on the dry and thir&s;ty ground," and con|verts to righteou&s;ne&s;s become as the drops of morn|ing dew! This hath God done in days pa&s;t, nor has he for&s;aken us in the pre&s;ent day. We hear glad ti|dings from &s;everal parts, yea, we do in &s;ome mea&s;ure "&s;ee the good of his cho&s;en, and rejoice in the glad|ne&s;s of his nation, and glory with his inheritance."</P>
<P>And do you not learn, my Reverend Fathers and Brethren, from all the movements of divine Provi|dence and from the prophetic words, "That the time, the &s;et time to favour Zion is near at hand?"
<PB N="40" REF="018530_0039_0FA7B4F5F1B06DB0">
Light and true religion have beamed forth from ea&s;t to we&s;t, from the beginning: The&s;e goings down of the &s;un, are the la&s;t regions to be thus vi&s;ited, be|fore the latter day glory. By the <HI>i&s;les</HI> and <HI>the &s;hips of Tar&s;hi&s;h</HI> in &s;cripture prophecy, is plainly imported all the we&s;tern i&s;lands, and all communications from the we&s;tern part of the world: And &s;hall not <HI>"the i&s;les &s;oon wait on God and the &s;hips of Tar&s;hi&s;h fir&s;t?"</HI> "So &s;hall they fear thy name from the we&s;t, and thy glory from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un,"&mdash;God &s;hall return the captivity of Jacob's tents, and the fulne&s;s of the Gen|tiles &s;hall come in. Shall not Ethiopia &s;oon &s;tretch out her hands to God? Is not the accompli&s;hment of tho&s;e words now in the plea&s;ing dawn? "Then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to &s;erve him with one con&s;ent. From beyond the river of Ethio|pia my &s;uppliants, the daughter of my di&s;per&s;ed &s;hall bring mine offering<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zeph. iii</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Your faith and prayer, oh ye &s;acred ones, will al|ways concur with the good-will of him that dwelt in the bu&s;h: And when Me&s;&s;iah reigns in vi&s;ible glory over all the earth, how will your &s;ouls rejoice.</P>
<P>God has now given us a ble&s;&s;ed inheritance, and &s;poke peace to this nation, in its growing greatne&s;s; he has &s;poke peace to &s;ome of the nations of Europe, and can &s;oon &s;peak peace to all the world; "Glory to God in the highe&s;t, peace on earth, good will towards men."</P>

I would now clo&s;e with a word to this great and re&s;pectable Audience at large.</P>
<P>My Fathers, Brethren, and dear Friends,</P>
<P>It is of the la&s;t importance that we bear in mind the de&s;ign of the Mo&s;t High in creating all worlds, and di&s;po&s;ing of all beings; this world with all the nations that dwell in it.

<P>Whatever part we act in this world; whatever we attain on this &s;ide the grave; if we have not made religion our great bu&s;ine&s;s, Je&s;us our hope, and God our portion, we &s;hall, in a few days, know we have been but deluded trifles, and &s;orely regret that ever we &s;aw the light, or had a portion among the living.</P>
<P>A life of religion is the only proper life of rational, immortal man; to know God in his dear &s;on is our be&s;t knowledge, and to &s;erve him our be&s;t work. Tho&s;e only who have this temper of mind, and thus live, are the true children of I&s;rael, to who&s;e happi|ne&s;s and glory, as you have heard, all the nations of the earth &s;hall bow, "To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron, to exe|cute upon them the judgment written; this honour has all his &s;aints; prai&s;e ye the Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxlix.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>We &s;hall all meet no more until the day of the complete triumph of the redeemed of the Lord, "When they &s;hall return and come with &s;ongs, to the heavenly Zion, and everla&s;ting joy &s;hall be upon their heads, they &s;hall obtain gladne&s;s and joy, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">
