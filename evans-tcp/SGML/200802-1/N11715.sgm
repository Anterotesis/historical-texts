<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MATTHEW xii. 25.</BIBL>
<Q>"<HI>Every kingdom divided a|gain&s;t it&s;elf is brought to de&s;olution; and every city or hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf &s;hall not &s;tand.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is an ob&s;ervation made by HIM who, by way of eminence, is mo&s;t ju&s;tly &s;tiled TRUE and FAITHFUL. The &s;pecial occa&s;ion of it was this: while our ble&s;&s;ed REDEEMER was in the world, employed about his Father's bu&s;ine&s;s, at a certain time there was <Q>brought unto him one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a devil, blind and dumb; and he healed him, in &s;o much that the blind and dumb both &s;pake and &s;aw, and all the people were amazed, and &s;aid, Is not this the Son of Da|vid? But when the Phari&s;ees hear'd it, they &s;aid, This fellow doth not ca&s;t out devils but by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils. And JESUS knew their thoughts, and &s;aid unto them, Eve|ry kingdom divided again&s;t it&s;elf, is brought to de&s;olution, and every city or hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf, &s;hall not &s;tand. And if &s;atan ca&s;t out &s;atan, he is divided again&s;t him&s;elf; how then &s;hall his kingdom &s;tand? And if I by Beelzebub ca&s;t out devils, by whom do your children ca&s;t them out? Therefore they &s;hall be
<PB N="8" REF="014805_0007_0F94DC75FA446D78">
your judges. But if I ca&s;t out devils by the &s;pirit of GOD, then the kingdom of GOD is come unto you. Or el&s;e, how can one enter into a &s;trong man's hou&s;e, and &s;poil his goods, except he fir&s;t bind the &s;trong man? and then he will &s;poil his hou&s;e. He that is not with me is a|gain&s;t me; and he that gathereth not with me, &s;cattereth abroad.</Q> The miracle which our SAVIOUR here wrought was indeed a notable one; giving to one that, under the influence and pow|er of a devil, was both blind and dumb, the pow|er both of &s;eeing and &s;peaking immediately. It excited the attention of the people, and filled them with wonder and &s;urprize, and brought them at once to quere, "Is not this the &s;on of David?" i. e. the promi&s;ed and expected MESSIAH. But the Phari&s;ees his crafty and bitter enemies and op|po&s;ers not being able to deny the fact, or di&s;cre|dit the reality of the miracle, which was &s;o great and vi&s;ible; or, bring the author of it into di&s;re|pute any other way, with equal ab&s;urdity and malice attribute it to diabolical intercour&s;e and influence. Our SAVIOUR refutes this vile a&s;per&s;i|on, by &s;hewing that it is founded on the folly and unrea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;atan, that craf|ty deceiver, &s;hould lend him his power to pull down his own kingdom and work effectually a|gain&s;t him&s;elf: that it is &s;uppo&s;ing &s;atan divided again&s;t him&s;elf and engaged for his own de&s;tructi|on. Be&s;ides, if they attributed the miracle he had wrought to the devil, he a&s;ks them, by whom do your children ca&s;t out devils? There were certain Jews among&s;t them&s;elves that ca&s;t out devils in the name of the GOD of Abraham, I&s;aac and Ja|cob,
<PB N="9" REF="014805_0008_0F94DC76CD2BA4A0">
and it was acknowledged that they did it by the power of GOD: and there was no cau&s;e &s;epa|rate from their malicious views and de&s;igns why they &s;hould not acknowledge that what he did was by the &s;ame power. And, &s;ays he, if I ca&s;t out devils by the &s;pirit of GOD, then the kingdom of GOD is come unto you, i. e. the MESSIAH is come, and the miracles which I work prove my divine mi&s;&s;ion and character. And further, he u&s;es a|nother argument to prove that the miracles which he wrought were by the power of GOD, and not by the help of Satan, which is this; that it requires greater &s;trength than Satan is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, to con|quer and overcome him, and effectually counter|act his influence, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him of his domini|on. He is the &s;trong man that reigns in this world or his hou&s;e; he is &s;tiled the GOD of this world, and no power but that which is truly di|vine, no &s;trength but that of Almighty GOD, can bind him and de&s;troy his kingdom. He has too much &s;ubtilty to do any thing him&s;elf to de&s;troy it, the promi&s;ed &s;eed, the glorious MESSIAH only can do it, and effectually brui&s;e his head. And all mankind are to be ranked in two cla&s;&s;es; and are either the &s;ubjects of CHRIST, the KING of ZION, and through him the children of GOD; or they are the &s;ubjects of Satan, the God of this world, who ruleth in the children of di&s;obedience. The former are free indeed, being made free by the SON of GOD, and are di&s;po&s;ed and engaged to promote the intere&s;t of CHRIST'S kingdom, which con&s;i&s;teth in <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace and joy in the</HI> HOLY GHOST; and which bears the mo&s;t friendly a&s;pect upon the happine&s;s of mankind. The latter are the &s;laves
<PB N="10" REF="014805_0009_0F94DC77878C57B0">
of &s;in and Satan; our SAVIOUR &s;ays of them, <HI>Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lu&s;ts of your fa|ther ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, becau&s;e there is no truth in him.</HI> They are engaged in the intere&s;t and belong to the kingdom of Satan, and their temper and conduct is inimical to the temporal and eternal happine&s;s of mankind. And both the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of men are perfectly known to HIM, who thus di&s;tin|gui&s;hes and characterizes them in the context: <HI>He that is not with me is again&s;t me, and he that gathereth not with me, &s;cattereth abroad.</HI> And when we &s;ee the HOLY JESUS while exerci&s;ing his miraculous pow|er in infinite mercy and kindne&s;s to men, loaded with unde&s;erved reproach, and unrea&s;onable, mali|cious calumny; and his mo&s;t benevolent actions mi&s;con&s;trued and a&s;&s;erted to be owing to the influ|ence of the Devil, we are not to wonder that the greate&s;t and be&s;t of men, exerting them&s;elves mo&s;t in the way of their duty, and for the good of others, often meet a &s;imilar treatment, and have all their benevolent and faithful efforts attributed by wick|ed, malicious and de&s;igning men, to the mo&s;t ab|&s;urd and diabolical motives, e&s;pecially as he him|&s;elf hath &s;aid <HI>The di&s;ciple is not above his ma&s;ter, nor the &s;ervant above his Lord. It is enough for the di&s;ciple that he be as his ma&s;ter, and the &s;ervant as his Lord. If they have called the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e Beelzebub, how much more &s;hall they call them of his hou&s;hold?</HI></P>
<P>HAVING &s;aid thus much of the original occa&s;ion and de&s;ign of the ob&s;ervations in the text; and of the &s;acred pa&s;&s;age &s;o immediately connected there|with, we proceed to a more particular con&s;iderati|on and improvement of it, or a theme of di&s;cour&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="014805_0010_0F94DC783A63FB98">
pertinent to the important bu&s;ine&s;s of this day, and the alarming &s;tate of public affairs.</P>
<P>EVERY <HI>kingdom divided again&s;t it&s;elf, is brought to de&s;olution; and every city or hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf &s;hall not &s;tand.</HI></P>
<P>THE truth of this ob&s;ervation carries its own e|vidence with it, and immdeiately approves it&s;elf to the rational and con&s;idering mind. Two contrary powers, of any kind whatever, that act again&s;t and oppo&s;e each other, can have no other tendency but to de&s;troy each other's force. And the greater the force they oppo&s;e to each other, the greater and more &s;peedy the mutual de&s;truction which they oc|ca&s;ion. This is illu&s;trated and verified in the na|tural and material, as well as moral and rational, world, and holds true (not like the declaratory right of the Briti&s;h Parliament to make laws to bind the colonies, but in reality) <HI>in all ca&s;es what|&s;oever.</HI> And in all bodies of men and civil com|munities whether great or &s;mall, whether con&s;ider|ed as kingdoms, provinces, cities, towns, or &s;till le&s;&s;er &s;ocieties, even particular private hou&s;es, and families, their &s;trength and &s;tability is in proporti|on to their union; and di&s;union and divi&s;ion among them have the mo&s;t fatal and de&s;tructive tendency. In proportion as the&s;e increa&s;e and rage, ruin ad|vances. They &s;everally bring kingdoms to de&s;o|lution, and no city or hou&s;e can flouri&s;h, or even &s;ub&s;i&s;t long under their baneful influence. Rag|ing and contending factions ever have been, and forever mu&s;t be, the ruin of tho&s;e among whom they ri&s;e and rule. The greate&s;t and mo&s;t power|ful kingdoms and &s;tates are brought to de&s;olution by them, while much le&s;&s;er bodies are pre&s;erved,
<PB N="12" REF="014805_0011_0F94DC78FAAF48F0">
and their intere&s;t, power and pro&s;perity wonder|fully increa&s;ed, by union, harmony and good a|greement, with their &s;trength all employed in one de&s;ign for mutual and univer&s;al good.</P>
<P>IN this way have gone to ruin many nations and people of pa&s;t ages, which were once great and flouri&s;hing, and chief among the nations, and ma|ny once &s;mall and very incon&s;iderable &s;tates, and by them oppre&s;&s;ed or greatly di&s;pi&s;ed, have &s;uc|ceeded to, even exceeded all their greatne&s;s, grandeur and glory. Divi&s;ion and di&s;cord brought de&s;olation upon the former; union, concord and per&s;everance &s;ecured the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of the latter. To union many a flouri&s;hing &s;tate hath owed its greatne&s;s, and its downfal to divi&s;i|on. Concord and per&s;everance advanced <HI>Rome</HI> to the height of its glory: And di&s;cord and faction &s;unk it in deba&s;ement and ruin. The final over|throw of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> nation, the de&s;olation of their capital city, their temple and their country, was chiefly brought on by their divi&s;ions and factions; and they did ten times more to their own undoing than all their foreign enemies and invaders.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee the ob&s;ervation in the text exemplified, univer&s;ally, in all in&s;tances without exception, as far as hi&s;tory or our acquaintance with kingdoms, cities or hou&s;es divided again&s;t them&s;elves can in|form us. And worldly wi&s;e, ambitious and de|&s;igning &s;tate&s;men, are &s;o well apprized of this truth, that it is long &s;ince a maxim with them, when they would weaken, en&s;lave or ruin a peo|ple (if not likely to be ea&s;ily done by open vio|lence and force) to do it by exerting and fomenting divi&s;ions among them.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="014805_0012_0F94DC79BA7587C8">
AND by the &s;ucce&s;sful practice of this policy many have reached the &s;ummit of iniquitous gran|deur and power, and been the mo&s;t awful &s;courges to mankind. DIVIDE and TYRANNIZE is the &s;tirrup by which they mount, and hold the &s;eat of their ill-gotten authority; and the goad too or &s;pur with which they unmercifully la&s;h on tho&s;e deluded and oppre&s;&s;ed by them, wa&s;ting all their &s;ub&s;tance and wearing out their very lives, merely to gratify their own de&s;potic will and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> both in the Southern and Northern parts of it; and the king|dom of <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;ubjected with them to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> crown, have all in their turns, been &s;haken to their foundations, with internal divi&s;ions, which have been excited, fomented and guided by arbitrary de|&s;igning men, and &s;pread ruin and de&s;olation all around. Since the political union of the two king|doms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland, Great-Britain</HI> hath more than once been &s;o unhappily divided again&s;t it&s;elf, as to appear evidently brought to the brink of de&s;olation, and inevitably falling into it, had not a &s;peedy end been put to &s;uch a divi&s;ion; or a <HI>glorious revolution</HI> taken place, through the kind in|terpotion of divine providence.</P>
<P>AND &s;uch appears to be the unhappy divided &s;tate of the nation at pre&s;ent, and her power and force &s;o much and directly employed again&s;t her own intere&s;t and &s;trength, that without &s;ome great and e&s;&s;ential alteration of mea&s;ures, and a timely happy revolution of affairs, ruin is inevitable; the power and glory of <HI>Britain</HI> &s;unk; and her name, if not lo&s;t, only pre&s;erved to reproach her with what &s;he once was, and might &s;till have
<PB N="14" REF="014805_0013_0F94DC7A859707C0">
been, had it not been for her own wicked and wanton abu&s;e of the favours Heaven ble&s;&s;ed her with: And being &s;ervilely &s;ubjected to &s;ome fo|reign power, &s;he may be forced too late, to rue her pre&s;ent mea&s;ures and conduct; and her&s;elf experi|ence tho&s;e &s;lavi&s;h chains which &s;he is now forging for <HI>America;</HI> who&s;e numerous and gallant &s;ons, had they been treated by her as they ought to have been, as ju&s;tice and her own intere&s;t required, would always have been bound to her by affection and duty, and when properly called to her a&s;&s;i&s;|tance, would have mo&s;t cheerfully adventured their lives and fortunes, for her protection, defence, and real intere&s;t and honour, and under providence rendered her &s;uperior to all her enemies.</P>
<P>SHE may one day, and that day not be very far off neither, want the help of her affectionate colo|ni&s;ts whom &s;he hath butchered and plundered.</P>
<P>BUT tho&s;e &s;he hath cruelly &s;lain can ri&s;e no more for her help: And with what an ill grace will &s;he call upon tho&s;e who &s;urvive, whom &s;he hath &s;tri|ven all in her power to weaken and oppre&s;s, beyond the power of helping them&s;elves?</P>
<P>AND the following ob&s;ervations of an elegant Engli&s;h writer of the pre&s;ent age, may not be im|pertinent to our &s;ubject, or unapplicable to the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent &s;tate of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and what, in a human view, is likely to be her future fate; or unimproveable by us.</P>
<P>"IN &s;uch a world as this, all things are in per|petual change, rotation and revolution: It is na|ture's proce&s;s. As the &s;ummer and winter gradu|ally &s;ucceed and encroach upon each other, or as the &s;un dawns and ari&s;es from darkne&s;s till he reach|es
<PB N="15" REF="014805_0014_0F94DC7B50668450">
the mid-day fervour of his culminating beam, and thence declines till he &s;ets, in utter darkne&s;s; even &s;o mighty nations, as well as families, have their commencement, a&s;cent and &s;ummit, declen|&s;ion, decay and period. The virtue of all nations and families begins in poverty, thence ari&s;es to in|du&s;try, genius, honour, perhaps to conque&s;t and empire; there is their zenith; but then comes on the load of pondrous wealth that gradually weighs them down from this meridian to indulgence, &s;en|&s;uality, guilt, corruption, pro&s;titution, &s;lavery, perdition."</P>
<P>WE in this country, at the pre&s;ent day, have every thing to induce us to cultivate union, and guard again&s;t divi&s;ions among our&s;elves. Whate|ver is mo&s;t dear and valuable, in this world, to millions now living, and will be &s;o to all the milli|ons of their po&s;terity after them, till the world &s;hall be no more, is at &s;take. The prize contend|ed for is the LIBERTY of <HI>AMERICA.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;trife whether this va&s;t continent, extend|ing in length and breadth more thou&s;ands of miles, than <HI>Great-Britain</HI> extends hundreds, &s;hall be ac|knowledged as an appendage to that i&s;land three thou&s;and miles di&s;tant from it; and &s;ubjected to the arbitrary government of a &s;et of men, at &s;uch a di&s;tance, when intere&s;t and humour may lead them perpetually to prey upon the property and happi|ne&s;s of this country, nature, rea&s;on, <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> re|volts at the thought. We de&s;ire not to deprive them of their rights and privileges, their country and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions; or to have their property, or any part of it at our arbitrary di&s;po&s;al: But wi&s;h them pro&s;perity and happine&s;s in the right u&s;e and improvement of them

all. And there is all rea&s;on that they &s;hould do the &s;ame to us. But how different, in reality is their di&s;|po&s;ition and conduct. By the force of arms they are trying to reduce us to a &s;tate of ab&s;olute &s;ub|jection to them; and have wantonly and impi|ou&s;ly re&s;olved that they have a right to make laws binding us <HI>in all ca&s;es whatever,</HI> a right belonging to no man nor body of men, and to no being, in the whole univer&s;e, nor to be tru&s;ted in the hands of any one, but of GOD <HI>the great Creator and &s;overeign Pro|prietor</HI> of all things, who is unerring in wi&s;dom and infinite in ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s and all perfection. They have unrighteou&s;ly begun the quarrel, and un&s;heathed the &s;word, and driven us to the &s;ad ne|ce&s;&s;ity of taking up arms for our own defence and protection.</P>
<P>CRITICAL, uncommon and peculiar as the cir|cum&s;tances are, which brought on, and have hi|therto attended, the unnatural conte&s;t, into which we have been reluctantly forced, Heaven hath wonderfully united the hearts of this country, and in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t crafty and unwearied efforts to &s;ow divi&s;ions among&s;t us, pre&s;erved and increa&s;ed the union, and crowned the exertions and enterprizes of the people of <HI>America</HI> with great and continued &s;ucce&s;s: And in many in&s;tances and re&s;|pects, through the &s;pecial interpo&s;ition of divine providence, with very unexpected and &s;urprizing &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>ALL &s;uch things are omens for good, demand our thankfulne&s;s, and encourage us to pro&s;ecute the virtuous &s;truggle, in humble dependance upon GOD, till he &s;hall be plea&s;ed to extricate us out of our troubles.</P>

THE martial &s;pirit that hath been excited, among all ranks and ages throughout this va&s;t continent; the readine&s;s with which men have willingly offered them&s;elves in the &s;ervice of their country; the chearfulne&s;s with which fond parents and rela|tives, part with their children and friends, and encourage and &s;pirit them to go forth in the de|fence and for the protection of our rights and pri|vileges, is a happy pre&s;age of de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s. We have felt, we now feel, and I tru&s;t po&s;terity will ever feel the happy effects of the CONTINENTAL UNION which hath taken place, and hath been hitherto (and we hope always will be) cheri&s;hed and pre&s;erved. It is owing to this that we are not reduced, by all the policy and power of our ene|mies to that abject, dependant, oppre&s;&s;ed and &s;la|vi&s;h &s;tate which they aimed at, but have made a noble and virtuous, a laudable and effectual re&s;i&s;|tance, the effects of which they feel, and long mu&s;t feel, to their own great mortification, di&s;appoint|ment and irreparable lo&s;s. They affected at fir&s;t to treat our union and efforts for the pre&s;ervation of our country, with contempt and ridicule; our union, &s;aid they, would be but as a rope of &s;and; our attempts to re&s;i&s;t, altogether folly and mad|ne&s;s. And to intimidate us, the fleets and armies of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> have been conjured up in imagi|nary repre&s;entation, more powerful and formida|ble than they really are, or ever have been, or ever can be, and mar&s;halled for our de&s;truction.</P>
<P>WE find them not una&s;&s;ailable, not invulnera|ble, not immortal; not altogether incapable of fear and being put to flight, and that a very ha&s;|ty one too; but in every encounter our brave coun|trymen

Tis true the war is ca|lamitous: For the mo&s;t righteous and pro&s;perous war is &s;o on many accounts: But that our country|men are as capable of all the exerci&s;es and fatigues of war, and as bold to face danger in all its forms, as any men need to be, or indeed can be; not to mention a great variety of heroic actions, in the &s;everal parts of <HI>America,</HI> by &s;ea and land during the pre&s;ent &s;truggle; the &s;ingle march to <HI>Quebec,</HI> through &s;uch a length of trackle&s;s, inho&s;pitable wilderne&s;s, at &s;o late a &s;ea&s;on; the gallant attempt our little army made upon that &s;trong fortre&s;s; and though repul&s;ed, yet &s;upporting them&s;elves, and maintaining the &s;iege of the city, in that fro|zen climate, at the colde&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the year; and all this again&s;t numbers va&s;tly &s;uperior to them, lodged in the walls and enjoying all the accommo|dations of a fine city.

<P>BUT &s;hould we fall into divi&s;ions and contenti|ons among our&s;elves, the con&s;equences are certain|ly fatal; a complication of the mo&s;t dreadful ca|lamities will involve us in inevitable ruin, we &s;hould &s;oon be &s;o weakened as to fall an ea&s;y prey into the hands of tho&s;e who are &s;eeking the ab&s;o|lute dominion and ma&s;tery over us.</P>

<P>IRELAND, had remained &s;eperate and indepen|dant to this day, un&s;ubjected to the crown of <HI>Bri|tain,</HI> had it not been for the fatal divi&s;ions, ani|mo&s;ities and contentions, which took place among them&s;elves. The manner in which they were &s;ubdued, and the treatment they have met with &s;ince, hold up &s;ufficient beacons for our warning. Divi&s;ions were created and fomented among them, by <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> intrigues, and their own arms made u&s;e of again&s;t them&s;elves.

And in rivetting the chains which hold them, the mo&s;t crafty policy hath been made u&s;e of. Under the name of a kingdom and a parlia|ment of their own, they have been cajoled and bribed into &s;ubjection to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> court; and brought under foreign influence; and the people, under the &s;pecious pretence of being governed, ac|cording to the genuine principles of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, chu&s;ing their repre&s;entatives and tam|ing
<PB N="22" REF="014805_0021_0F94DD9846CD45A0">
them&s;elves by virtue of &s;uch repre&s;entation, have been cruelly re&s;tricted in their trade and ma|nufactures, &s;addled with pen&s;ions, &s;queezed, fleec|ed and oppre&s;&s;ed into wretchedne&s;s, and the wick|ed and venal parricides of their country, and idle pampered <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> pen&s;ioners, riot and fatten upon their mi&s;ery.</P>

<P>THE chains once rivetted are not ea&s;ily &s;haken off, and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> admini&s;tration is always care|ful, by the various arts of bribery and corruption, to gain over to its intere&s;t a venal majority.

<P>IF we are not a free and happy people, it will be our own fault, and owing to the abu&s;e of the light and advantages providence hath ble&s;&s;ed us with: and the pre&s;ent &s;truggle, if not maintain'd with union and per&s;everance, till crown'd with

&s;ucce&s;s, but dropt through our own divi&s;ions, or timidity, will render this country, to all future ages, in&s;tead of an a&s;ylum for per&s;ecuted liberty, in&s;tead of the envy of &s;laves and tyrants, in&s;tead of the boa&s;t, happine&s;s and glory of freemen, a &s;hame and reproach through all the earth.</P>

<P>'TWAS for this that our fore fathers fled from the per&s;ecution and tyranny of the age they lived in, and braved every danger and difficulty, to &s;eek out and &s;ettle this di&s;tant, and then wilderne&s;s country.

<P>REASON and religion, every argument and mo|tive, that can influence a rational and pious mind, call for the dutiful exertion of all our united powers, to defend, protect and improve the rights, liberties and privileges with which GOD, in his pro|vidence, hath &s;o richly ble&s;&s;ed us, again&s;t all foes and invaders what&s;oever.</P>
<P>THE controver&s;y in which we are engaged, is, in its nature and con&s;equences, of the greate&s;t impor|tance. A &s;truggle of the kind, of &s;uch magnitude and &s;o intere&s;ting and exten&s;ive in its influence, hath as yet no place in the hi&s;tory of mankind. Things new and &s;trange, dark and perplexing, things at one and the &s;ame time mo&s;t critical and intere&s;ting, and &s;uch as mu&s;t be acted upon, and mu&s;t influence our conduct, and affect the public, often lie in our way; and no wonder in many in|&s;tances men differ in &s;entiment, even the wi&s;e and good, and as true friends to their country as any it can boa&s;t: Tis much rather a wonder that in &s;uch a &s;trange perplexed &s;tate as we have been thrown into, the difference hath not been much greater.</P>
<P>THIS teaches us the wi&s;dom and great nece&s;&s;ity of mutual forbearance and conde&s;cention towards one another; of guarding again&s;t all irritating, re|proachful language and injurious conduct; and aiming con&s;tantly at what we, in our be&s;t judg|ment
<PB N="27" REF="014805_0026_0F94DD9BFB45DBD0">
think is for the greate&s;t welfare of our country. In the pur&s;uit of this our HEARTS and HANDS &s;hould be united, and if we cannot be perfectly agreed in all particular mea&s;ures, yet we &s;hould &s;o keep the grand end in view, as to aim in all our wi&s;hes and conduct at that; and thus bury all uncomfortable and hurtful contentions among our&s;elf, and do nothing to <HI>provoke one another except to love and good works.</HI></P>
<P>AND the guilt and wickedne&s;s of that man is hardly to be conceived, who is di&s;po&s;ed to take ad|vantage of the times, and (under the &s;pecious pre|text of aiming at the liberty and pro&s;perity of his country) a&s;per&s;e characters, gratify his own re|venge, or more per&s;onal &s;elf-intere&s;ted views of a|ny kind; or is willing to <HI>owe his greatne&s;s to his coun|try's ruin.</HI></P>
<P>AND how ab&s;urd, incon&s;i&s;tent and malicious is the temper and conduct of tho&s;e who impute all the exertions of our wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men, in the cau&s;e of their country, to a &s;pirit of faction, and &s;elf-intere&s;ted and wicked motives and de&s;igns, and to any thing be&s;ides the good of their country? This has been done by tho&s;e &s;tiled <HI>the friends of go|vernment,</HI> on both &s;ides the water. And yet it is notorious to all impartial ob&s;ervers, that the&s;e our patriots are acting from the &s;ame principles and motives, with the greate&s;t and be&s;t men the nation could ever boa&s;t, and who are acknowledged by them&s;elves to have been the true&s;t friends to her rights, liberties and happine&s;s; and in defence of the&s;e and oppo&s;ition to tyranny, &s;ome of them no|bly bled; and by means of their virtuous &s;trug|gle,
<PB N="28" REF="014805_0027_0F94DD9CC16DB900">
the nation has enjoyed &s;o much liberty and happine&s;s as it has.</P>
<P>DOES not this comprize the ab&s;urdity and malice of the ancient phari&s;aical &s;pirit? They act like true patriots, they venture life and their ALL in the cau&s;e of their country, this cannot be denied, but then &s;ay our enemies, they aim not at the good but the ruin of their country: <HI>ju&s;t as well may Sa|tan ca&s;t out Satan.</HI></P>
<P>IT is peculiarly our happine&s;s in this colony, that in the mid&s;t of the perplexed &s;tate of affairs through the country, our civil polity and form of government hath been and yet continues compleat. And we have rea&s;on to think it hath had a very exten&s;ive happy influence through the whole con|tinent. And never did the freemen of it, need &s;uch wi&s;dom, &s;teadine&s;s and integrity in their conduct as at the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>WE need a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the importance and hap|py effects of union; and of the malignity and fatal influence of divi&s;ions, and of the &s;olemn oath of GOD which is upon us; and this, and this alone, will enable us to di&s;charge a good con&s;cience; and thus doing is the only way in which we can hope for the direction and ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven.</P>
<P>I ADD no more, but pray ALMIGHTY GOD to ble&s;s what hath been &s;poken agreeable to truth, and cau&s;e it to have a genuine, practical influence upon us all.</P>
