<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE nature and purpo&s;e of this publi|cation will be &s;ufficiently explained by the following extract of a letter from DR GRE|GORY, in Scotland, to the Editor.</P>
<P>"I HAVE now peru&s;ed, with great attention and much plea&s;ure, the tran&s;lation of DR. FAUST's Catechi&s;m of Health, which you put into my hands a few days ago. I adhere to the favourable opinion of it which I expre&s;&s;ed to you after
<PB N="vi" REF="033718_0004_0FF91442BA062810">reading only two or three pages of it when you fir&s;t &s;hewed it me; and as in reading it over carefully, I put my marks either of a&s;&s;ent and approbation, or of di&s;&s;ent, or of doubt, to almo&s;t every propo&s;ition in it; I can &s;ay, with confidence, that I think it a work of very extraordinary merit, and one that, if it were generally known in this country, might be of infinite u&s;e. It is, indeed, the be&s;t popular medical work I ever read: nor do I in the lea&s;t wonder at the exten&s;ive di&s;tribution, and the high e&s;timation of it in Germany.</P>
<P>To the be&s;t of my judgment it con|tains more &s;olid good &s;en&s;e, and more u&s;eful information, in le&s;s bulk, than any medical book I ever &s;aw, from the Aphori&s;ms of Hippocrates to your la&s;t edi|tion of the Family Phy&s;ician inclu&s;ive;
<PB N="vii" REF="033718_0005_0FF91445728B1640">and, what I reckon of very great con&s;e|quence, there is le&s;s mixture of non&s;en&s;e in it, which might either confound or mi&s;lead tho&s;e for who&s;e u&s;e it is intend|ed.</P>
<P>I highly approve your benevolent purpo&s;e of reprinting it here, and diffu&s;ing it as generally as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I think you &s;hould print a great many copies on the cheape&s;t paper, that the poor people may afford to purcha&s;e it, or, that tho&s;e in more affluent circum&s;tances may be encouraged to purcha&s;e great numbers of them, and to di&s;tribute them among their poor neighbours. By all means print a good number in the hand&s;ome&s;t manner on the fine&s;t paper, to tempt fine people to buy and to read it.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="033718_0006_0FF8C435CA8A5958">If you think my name and recommenda|tion can be of any u&s;e in promoting the di&s;tribution of &s;uch a work, you are heartily welcome to u&s;e them in the mo&s;t public manner, or even to print this letter at the beginning of it. Nay more, if you plea&s;e, I will revi&s;e it, and &s;uperintend the printing of it, and correct the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>If you approve of this, you mu&s;t publi&s;h it under the title of "<HI>Selection</HI> from the Catechi&s;m of Health of DR. FAUST, tran&s;|lated from the German, and now publi&s;h|ed for the u&s;e of the Inhabitants of Scot|land:" you may &s;ay revi&s;ed by me if you plea&s;e. I &s;hould in that ca&s;e abridge it con&s;iderably, by omitting &s;ome things which appear to me erroneous, or doubtful, or u&s;ele&s;s, or whim&s;ical; or not &s;uited to the
<PB N="ix" REF="033718_0007_0FF9144CECC91E50">&s;tate and manners of the people of this country.</P>
<P>DR. FAUST you will ob&s;erve has &s;ome whims: for example, about the very free u&s;e of potatoes hurting the under|&s;tanding: Sulphur ointment being dan|gerous to health, &amp;c. (I even &s;u&s;pect an error in the tran&s;lation there, of <HI>&s;ulphur</HI> for <HI>mercurial</HI>; which ra&s;hly u&s;ed is very dangerous, and may even have tho&s;e very bad effects which are imputed to the &s;ulphur, and which I never knew &s;ulphur produce.)</P>
<P>There are &s;everal errors, and &s;ome very ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages in the tran&s;lation; evidently proceeding from the Tran&s;la|tor's
<PB N="x" REF="033718_0008_0FF9144FD26945A8"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h by MR. DASSE, him&s;elf, a German.</NOTE> imperfect knowledge of the Eng|li&s;h language, (<HI>luxes,</HI> for <HI>luxuries, re|pul&s;es,</HI> for <HI>repels, heavy,</HI> for <HI>&s;evere,</HI> and &s;o forth.) The&s;e I &s;hould, of cour&s;e, correct in reprinting it.</P>
<P>The plan for extirpating the &s;mall|pox, &amp;c. I &s;hould omit as impracti|cable, at lea&s;t in this country, at this time. I doubt whether it ever can &s;uc|ceed: But &s;uppo&s;ing the Author to be perfectly right, this is not a time for &s;uch a plan: And people &s;hould be told, not always what is ab&s;olutely be&s;t in it&s;elf, but what is the be&s;t that they <HI>can</HI> or <HI>will</HI> do: For example, as to the &s;mall-pox, univer&s;al inoculation, and the
<PB N="xi" REF="033718_0009_0FF9145250460018">cool regimen: And as to &s;trong liquor, not ab&s;taining from it altogether, (as certainly would be be&s;t,) but only getting drunk with ale or porter, in&s;tead of whi&s;ky and gin, which are ab&s;olute ruin to them in mind, body, and e&s;tate.</P>
<P>The form of Catechi&s;m by no means does ju&s;tice to the &s;trong good &s;en&s;e, the found morality, and the rational piety of DR. FAUST: Nor can it make that &s;trong and plea&s;ing impre&s;|&s;ion, which cla&s;&s;ical compo&s;ition would do, on readers of a cultivated ta&s;te: But his &s;entiments need not the aid of ornament: And the form of Catechi&s;m, and his frequent, and &s;eemingly needle&s;s, repetitions are probably well &s;uited to the &s;tate and habits of tho&s;e for who&s;e u&s;e chiefly his work is de&s;igned. They will
<PB N="xii" REF="033718_0010_0FF914574A34FDC8">tend to a&s;&s;i&s;t the memory, and to make the impre&s;&s;ion &s;tronger; as well as to ena|ble the people to apply the precepts ea&s;ily and readily. Therefore, as he made it at fir&s;t a Catechi&s;m, &s;o let it remain."</P>
<P>The Editor has only to add, that the &s;election propo&s;ed has been made, and the printing of it revi&s;ed, by DR. GRE|GORY, according to his promi&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>I. Of Health; its Value, and the Duty of pre|&s;erving it, and of in&s;tructing Mankind, par|ticularly Children, in the&s;e important Sub|jects.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 1. DEAR Children, to breathe, to live in this world, created by God, is it an advantage? Is it to enjoy hap|piness and plea&s;ure?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes. To live is to enjoy happine&s;s and plea&s;ure; for life is a precious gift of the Almighty.</P>
<P>P&s;. cl. 6. Let every thing that has breath prai&s;e the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="033718_0016_0FF9146C946E0E88">P&s;. cxlv. 16. Thou, O Lord, &s;atisfie&s;t the de&s;ire of every thing living.</P>
<P>P&s;. xxxvi. 5, 8. Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds. They &s;hall be abundantly &s;atisfied with the fatness of thy hou&s;e; and thou &s;hall make them drink of the river of thy plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>P&s;. cxxxvi. 1, 8, 9, 25. O give thank unto the Lord, for he is good. To him that made the &s;un to rule by the day; the moon and &s;tars to rule by night; who gives food to all fle&s;h: For his mercy endureth for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 2. What other proofs have we to &s;hew that life is an excellent gift of God?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The in&s;tinct, or natural anxiety of mankind to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 3. What mu&s;t be the &s;tate of the hu|man body, the habitation and &s;lave of the &s;oul, that man may enjoy a long, pro&s;perous and happy life?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It mu&s;t be healthy.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 4. How el&s;e can you prove that man ought to be in a good &s;tate of health?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the commandment of God, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="033718_0017_0FF914700B74C128"><Q>In the &s;weat of thy face &s;halt thou eat bread.</Q>
Gen. iii. 19.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 5. Can we po&s;&s;ibly promote the per|fection and happine&s;s of our &s;ouls, if we do not take proper care of our bodies.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. God has &s;o intimately united &s;oul and body, that by a rational care taken of the body, the happine&s;s and purity of the &s;oul is increa&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 6. What is under&s;tood by a &s;tate of good health?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That the body is free from pains and infirmities, fulfils its duties cheerfully and with ea&s;e, and is always obedient to the &s;oul.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 7. How does he feel who enjoys health?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Strong; full of vigour and &s;pirits; he reli&s;hes his meals; is not affected by wind and weather; goes through exerci&s;e and la|bour with ea&s;e, and feels him&s;elf always happy.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 8. And what are the &s;en&s;ations of the &s;ick? Are they like tho&s;e we have de&s;cribed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By no means; the &s;ick man feels him|&s;elf weak and languid; he has no appetite; he cannot work, nor brave wind and wea|ther;
<PB N="4" REF="033718_0018_0FF91476AD4A67F8">he labours under continual anxiety and pains, and very few are the plea&s;ures of his life.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 9. Can you children be merry and laugh, joke, and jump about, eat, drink, and &s;leep, when you are ill?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No We can only do &s;o when we are in good health.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>If a child be pre&s;ent who was ill not long ago, the Ma&s;ter will take the oppor|tunity of a&s;king him the following que&s;tion:&mdash;"You was ill; tell me did you feel your&s;elf &s;o happy, &s;o ea&s;y as you do now?" To this a &s;en&s;ible child will an&s;wer, or will will be taught to an&s;wer&mdash;"I found my&s;elf exceed|ingly ill, I could neither eat, drink, nor &s;leep; nothing afforded me plea|&s;ure or joy; I was full of anxiety and pains; but now re&s;tored to health; thanks be to God, I know it is the greate&s;t good."</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 10. The ble&s;&s;ings of health then mu&s;t be very great?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are indeed. Health is the mo&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="033718_0019_0FF91478486F7C20">precious good, and the mo&s;t certain means of enjoying all other ble&s;&s;ings and plea&s;ures of life.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 11. What &s;ays Sirach of health?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In the 30th Chapter, v. 14, 15, 16, he &s;ays, "Better is the poor being &s;ound and &s;trong of con&s;titution, than a rich man that is afflicted in his body. Health and good e&s;tate of body are above all gold, and a &s;trong body above infinite wealth. There are no riches above a &s;ound body, and no joy above the joy of the heart.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 12. Cannot the &s;ick as well as the heal|thy, enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings and plea&s;ures of life?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. They have no charms for the &s;ick.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 13. Of what u&s;e then is all worldly happine&s;s to him who is &s;ick, and cannot enjoy it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Of very little u&s;e, if any.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 14. If then health be the mo&s;t preci|ous boon of life, what duties has a man in that re&s;pect to di&s;charge towards him&s;elf?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He mu&s;t &s;trive to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 15. Is it &s;ufficient if he take care of his own health?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. It is al&s;o his duty to take care of the life and health of his fellow-creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="033718_0020_0FF8C45895CE0418"><HI>Q.</HI> 16. And what is the duty of parents towards their children?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are bound to take the tendere&s;t care of their health and life.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>School-ma&s;ters and parents ought to &s;eize every opportunity of impre&s;&s;ing on the minds of their children, the great importance of the invaluable ble&s;&s;ings of health, and the con&s;e|quent duty to pre&s;erve it, by innocent plea&s;ures, conducive to health. They ought on the other hand, to point out the mournful in&s;tances of multiplied &s;or|rows and mi&s;eries which pre&s;ent them|&s;elves daily to our view, in the per&s;ons of the &s;ick and di&s;ea&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 17. Do they fulfil this duty?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Very &s;eldom.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 18. Why &s;o &s;eldom?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Becau&s;e few of them are &s;en&s;ible of the real value of health.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="033718_0021_0FF9147DD909A718">2. Mo&s;t of them are ignorant of the &s;truc|ture and &s;tate of the human body.</P>
<P N="3">3. Equally ignorant of what is condu|cive or hurtful to health.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 19. What is the cau&s;e of this igno|rance?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The want of proper in&s;tructions.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 20. But as God wills the happine&s;s of all mankind, &s;hould they not be brought from ignorance to the knowledge of truth?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes. It would be right, good, and dutiful to in&s;truct every body, particularly little children like us, and to teach us the &s;tructure of the human body, and the be&s;t means of per&s;erving health.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 21. Is it not, therefore, your duty to pay the greate&s;t attention to the in&s;tructions which you are now to receive, re&s;pecting the mo&s;t valuable boon of life?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We &s;hall exert our&s;elves to the utmo&s;t to under&s;tand and to remember them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 22. Is it &s;ufficient to receive tho&s;e in|&s;tructions, and to remember them?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No. We &s;hould al&s;o &s;trictly conform our&s;elves to tho&s;e in&s;tructions.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>Children with &s;curfy heads ought to keep their heads cool, clean, and uncovered; their hair cut, or repeatedly combed; which will be &s;ufficient to cure the evil, for to cure it with &s;alves is a very danger|ous cu&s;tom.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 96. Can the &s;un or air be prejudicial to the &s;kin?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; if proper care be taken to keep the &s;kin clean, they can do no harm.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 97. But will not children be &s;cotched by the &s;un if expo&s;ed to its heat without being covered?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; tho&s;e that are accu&s;tomed from their infancy to go uncovered, will not be affected by the &s;un.</P>

<P><PB N="32" REF="033718_0046_0FF914E132F97FE0"><HI>A.</HI> It ought not to be combed back|wards, or tied behind; but it ought to hang free round the head to protect it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 99. Ought the hair to be often combed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; it ought to be kept in order and combed repeatedly every day; which pre|vents vermin from &s;ettling in it, and indu|ces cheerfulne&s;s and liveline&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 100. Is it right that the collars of &s;hirts and neckcloths &s;hould pre&s;s the neck and its veins?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; the neck ought not to be &s;queezed; and, therefore, children ought to have their necks bare.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 101. How ought childrens garments to be arranged?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> So as not to impede the free and ea&s;y motions of the body, or prevent the acce&s;s of the fre&s;h &s;trengthening air to it; they, therefore, ought to be free, wide and open.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 102. What further is requi&s;ite for this dre&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It ought to be &s;imple, clean, light, cool, cheap, and ea&s;y to put on or take off;
<PB N="33" REF="033718_0047_0FF914E551B50908">it ought to be different in every re&s;pect from that of older or grown-up per&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 103. What other rea&s;on is there for making this di&s;tinction between the dre&s;s of children and grown-up per&s;ons?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> To induce children to live with le&s;s re&s;traint and greater happine&s;s in the &s;oci|ety of each other; to impre&s;s upon their minds an idea of their weak, helple&s;s condition, in order thereby to check the too early ebullitions of that pride which leads children to ape the cu&s;toms and acti|ons of grown-up per&s;ons; a practice un|becoming at their age, and dangerous to their health and morals.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 104. How, and of what materials ought childrens garments to be made?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> A child ought to wear a wide linen frock, white, with blue &s;tripes, having wide &s;hort &s;leeves, and a &s;hirt of the &s;ame form.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;hape of the frock is repre&s;ented in the fronti&s;piece of this book; it ought
<PB N="34" REF="033718_0048_0FF914E885AB7250">to be without pocket-holes, and not very long, having the &s;leeves of &s;uf|ficient length, to reach down to the el|bows, and no farther. The collar of the &s;hirt to fall back over that of the frock,&mdash;the only garment that a child &s;hould wear over his &s;hirt, in order that it may move ea&s;ily and without re&s;traint; and that the fre&s;h air, hav|ing free acce&s;s to its body, may &s;trengthen it.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 105. Ought children to wear this dre&s;s in the winter time?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; with the addition of a woollen frock, to be worn between the &s;hirt and the linen frock.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 106. How are the &s;tockings of chil|dren to be made?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They mu&s;t be &s;hort, and not tied; it would, therefore, be advi&s;able to let them only wear &s;ocks, to cover the feet in the &s;hoes.</P>

<P>Stockings, that cover the knees, may produce &s;wellings in them; they
<PB N="35" REF="033718_0049_0FF914EF3751E168">ought, therefore, not to cover the knees, nor be worn with garters.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 107. Will not children find them|&s;elves too cold if their ankles are left bare?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; cold, if they are accu&s;tomed to it, will not affect their ankles more than their arms. It will &s;trengthen their limbs. In &s;hort, they will be kept &s;ufficiently warm by the &s;hirt and frock.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 108. What is the form of the human foot?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> At the toes it is broad, the heel &s;mall, and the in&s;ide of the foot is longer than the out&s;ide. See Fig. I.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 109. Why has it this form?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That man may walk and &s;tand with ea&s;e and firmne&s;s, and move his body freely.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 110. How ought &s;hoes, particularly tho&s;e of children, to be formed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought to have the &s;ame form as the feet: they, therefore, ought not to be made by one, but two la&s;ts, as the &s;hape of the feet may indicate.</P>

<P>Each foot may be laid upon a &s;heet of paper, and its true &s;hape drawn with a pencil, after which model two &s;eparate la&s;ts may be made.</P>
<P>From Plate II. it appears clearly how &s;hoes ought to be &s;haped. The mid|dle Fig. I. is the original &s;hape of the &s;ole of the left foot; the fir&s;t, Fig. III. &s;hows how the &s;ole of the left &s;hoe ought to be formed; and the la&s;t, Fig. II. &s;hows clearly, that the &s;hoes we u&s;ually wear, made on one la&s;t, do not at all fit.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 111. Ought the &s;hoes of children to have heels?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; heels cau&s;e the back tendon to &s;hrink and impede the free and ea&s;y motions of the body in walking and running.</P>

<P>When children are &s;uffered to walk much, and are bare-footed, they ac|quire an ea&s;y and &s;teady pace. Little children ought not to wear &s;hoes be|fore the eighteenth month; if they do, the &s;oles mu&s;t be thin and &s;oft, that they may learn to walk ea&s;ily and well. Boots ought not to be worn by children.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 112. How ought, therefore, chil|dren, male as well as female, to be dre&s;|&s;ed from the beginning of the third to the end of the &s;eventh or eighth year?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Their heads and necks mu&s;t be free and bare, the body clothed with a wide &s;hirt and frock, with &s;hort &s;leeves; the feet covered only with a pair of &s;ocks to be worn in the &s;hoes; the &s;hoes ought to be made without heels, and to fit well.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 113. What benefit will be derived from this kind of dre&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The body will become healthier, &s;tronger, taller, and more beautiful; chil|dren will learn the be&s;t and mo&s;t graceful

<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>That by the general introduction of this &s;imple and ea&s;y dre&s;s, the human race would be benefited, and rendered every way more accompli&s;hed, cannot be doubted. It is, therefore to be hoped that it will be generally adopted.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 114. How mu&s;t the whole dre&s;s be kept?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Orderly and clean. The &s;hirt ought always to be clean, and the frock decent, not worn out, or torn to pieces, or un|clean.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 115. When children appear always combed and wa&s;hed, and in a clean &s;hirt, and dre&s;&s;ed from top to toe with decency and cleanline&s;s, what is commonly con|cluded from it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That their parents are &s;en&s;ible, kind, and loving.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 116. And with re&s;pect to the children them&s;elves?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are beloved: the boy will be|come

<P>Stays and &s;tiff jackets are inventions of the mo&s;t pernicious nature; they di&s;|figure the beautiful and upright &s;hape of a woman, and, in&s;tead of rendering her &s;traight, as was formerly &s;uppo&s;ed, they make her crook-backed; they in|jure the brea&s;t and bowels; ob&s;truct the breathing and dige&s;tion; hurt the brea&s;ts and nipples &s;o much, that ma|ny mothers are prevented by their u&s;e from &s;uckling their children; many hence get cancers, and at la&s;t lo&s;e both

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 120. Why ought it to be fre&s;h, clear, and dry?</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 124. By what means is air corrupt|ed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The air is corrupted in hou&s;es and rooms that are not &s;ufficiently ventilated: be&s;ide, if in the vicinity of the habitations of man there be mora&s;&s;es, or &s;tagnant waters, they are &s;ufficient to corrupt the air.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 125. By what other means is air ren|dered noxious?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Vapours ari&s;ing from damp, foul things; the breath and per&s;pirations of many per&s;ons; the &s;moke from lamps, tallow candles, and &s;nuffs: the &s;team from ironing linen; the exhalations that ari&s;e from comb|ing wool, and from burning charcoal; all tend, in a greater or le&s;s degree, to corrupt or deprave the air, and render it capable of impeding the action of the lungs, or induc|ing &s;uffocation.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 126. What ought people to do that are much confined to rooms or cham|bers?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought frequently to open their

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 127. What other method can be de|vi&s;ed to prevent the depravation of air in a room?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By making two holes, one through the outer wall of the hou&s;e, that will open into the room near the floor of it; the other near the cieling, through the oppo&s;ite in|ner wall or partition; the external atmo&s;|phere will enter at the hole near the floor, and di&s;&s;ipate the foul air through the aper|ture above.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> What el&s;e ought people to do, to ob|tain &s;o de&s;irable an end?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They ought to keep their rooms clean, and in proper order; nothing &s;uperfluous, or that can po&s;&s;ibly corrupt the air, ought to be &s;uffered in them.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 129. What are the &s;igns by which you may know whether rooms be clean, and contain whole&s;ome air?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> When there are no cobwebs in the corners, or on the cieling of the room, nor du&s;t, nor &s;traw, nor filth of any kind; when the windows are clean and clear, and no offen&s;ive &s;mell, or unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation,

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 141. Is it not nece&s;&s;ary after meals to clean or wa&s;h the mouth?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes. Immediately after each repa&s;t: the mouth ought to be clean&s;ed with cold wa|ter; the gums and teeth are thus pre&s;erved &s;ound and good, and the tooth-ach pre|vented.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 142. Ought not children to be wa&s;hed and combed before they go to &s;chool?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes. Children ought, morning and evening, before they go to &s;chool, to be combed and wa&s;hed; that, being thus ren|dered comfortable and cheerful, they may with greater ea&s;e and plea&s;ure advance in the paths of &s;cience and virtue.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> It is as much their duty to wa&s;h their children as it is to feed and clothe them; for children that are often wa&s;hed improve in health; their clothes are always clean; cleanline&s;s becomes familiar to them; and they grow up virtuous, polite and happy.</P>

<P>That man was not de&s;igned to live on meat, or on vegetables, only, is evident from the con&s;truction of his teeth &s;tomach, and bowels.

<HEAD>ADDRESS TO CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>Children, brandy is a bad liquor. A few hundred years ago brandy was not known among us. About 1000 years ago, the de&s;tructive art of di&s;tilling &s;pirits of wine from wine was found out; and 300 years ago, brandy was fir&s;t di&s;tilled from corn. In the be|ginning it was con&s;idered as phy&s;ic. It did not, however, come into gene|ral u&s;e till the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century, or rather till within the la&s;t thirty years, that it has become an univer&s;al beverage, to the great detriment of mankind.</P>
<P>Our forefathers in former times, who had no idea of brandy, were quite different people from what we are; they were much more healthy and &s;trong. Brandy, whether drunk by it&s;elf, or at meals, cannot be con|verted into blood, fle&s;h, or bone;
<PB N="69" REF="033718_0083_0FF9157691164480">con&s;equently, it cannot give health or &s;trength, nor does it promote dige&s;|tion: it only makes one unhealthy, &s;tupid, lazy, and weak. It is, there|fore, a downright fal&s;ehood, that brandy, as a common beverage, is u&s;e|ful, good, and nece&s;&s;ary. Our fore|fathers lived well without it. And as experience teaches us, that even the mo&s;t moderate, and mo&s;t rea&s;onable, give way to the baneful cu&s;tom of drinking every day more and more brandy, it is much better, in order to avoid temptation, to drink none at all; for, believe me, children, brandy de|prives all who addict them&s;elves to the immoderate and daily u&s;e of it&mdash;of health, rea&s;on, and virtue. It impels us to quit our hou&s;e and home, to abandon our wives and children, and entails on its wretched votaries, mi|&s;ery and di&s;ea&s;e, which may de&s;cend to the third and fourth generation.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved in all countries, in England, Scotland, Sweden, North America, and Germany, that in pro|portion to the quantity of brandy con|&s;umed, were the evils which health,
<PB N="70" REF="033718_0084_0FF9157C154A7C38">&s;trength, rea&s;on, virtue, indu&s;try, pro&s;pe|rity, dome&s;tic and matrimonial felicity, the education of children, humanity, and the life of man had to encounter.</P>
<P>It was this that induced an Indian in North America, of the name of Lackawanna, to &s;ay, that the brandy which had been introduced among&s;t the Indians by the Engli&s;h, tended to corrupt mankind and de&s;troy hu|manity.

<P>The &s;ecret remedies again&s;t the canine madne&s;s, and tho&s;e which are u&s;ually re&s;orted to as infallible, are good for nothing. The only certain means of preventing the fatal effects con&s;equent on the bite of a mad-dog (producing canine madne&s;s, &s;hewn, by a &s;trong abhorrence from water), are cutting out the bitten part, or burning it with

<P><HI>A.</HI> No. Sick people ought as little as po&s;&s;ible to be di&s;turbed by talking; and every thing about them ought to be quiet.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 310. Is it proper to admit vi&s;itors, or many per&s;ons, into the room where a &s;ick per&s;on lies?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; becau&s;e the air becomes cor|rupted by the breath and exhalations from &s;o many vi&s;itors, who generally come through curio&s;ity, and therefore ought not to be admitted.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 311. What ought to be the &s;tate of the air in the rooms or chambers of the &s;ick?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> All &s;ick per&s;ons, particularly tho&s;e that labour under fever, ought to breathe fre&s;h, pure, and dry air.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 313. What is further nece&s;&s;ary?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That the room where the &s;ick per&s;on lies be aired by keeping the window open al|mo&s;t the whole day; that the windows and

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 314. What kind of room is be&s;t a|dapted for a &s;ick per&s;on?</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 315. Should the room of a &s;ick per|&s;on be light&s;ome or dark?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It &s;hould not be very light&s;ome, but rather darki&s;h, as the light di&s;turbs the re|po&s;e of the patient.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 316. What kind of bed doth a &s;ick per&s;on require?</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 319. May the curtains of the bed be drawn in which a &s;ick per&s;on lies?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; becau&s;e it deprives him of the fre&s;h air.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 323. How ought the bed of a &s;ick per&s;on to be placed?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Not near a cold, damp wall, but in an open, free &s;ituation, that the per&s;on may be approached and a&s;&s;i&s;ted on either &s;ide without inconvenience.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 324. Is it proper to keep the heads of per&s;ons ill of fevers, who are commonly very much affected with head-achs, warm.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; their heads are to be kept cool and uncovered, that the head-ach and deli|rium may not increa&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 325. What are &s;ick per&s;ons to drink, particularly tho&s;e who are afflicted with fe|vers, which induce thir&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Cold, pure water, which in fevers ought to be mixed with vinegar or lemon-juice. A piece of toa&s;ted bread may al&s;o, be added, being a good ingredient.</P>

<P>Children, the natural &s;mall-pox is a bad di&s;temper&mdash;as bad as the plague? But God has, in his goodne&s;s, enabled man to find out a remedy for the alle|viation of the great mi&s;eries occa&s;ion|ed by it.

<HEAD>INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO INOCULATE.</HEAD>
<P>In order to inoculate a child in a good &s;tate of health, a needle is dipped in a little fre&s;h thin matter of true &s;mall-pox, with few pu&s;tules. With this needle an inci&s;ion is made of the breadth of a &s;traw under the &s;carf &s;kin of the arm above the elbow, with|out drawing any blood, &s;o that the matter &s;hall be lodged under the upper &s;kin; and this is called inoculation for the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>The effect produced, and the conduct to be ob&s;erved by the patients, are as fol|lows: Having the great advantage of knowing to a certainty that the per&s;on inoculated will have the &s;mall-pox within ten or fourteen days, the &s;tric|te&s;t regularity and temperance with regard to diet is to be enjoined.</P>
<P>The fourth, fifth, or &s;ixth day the in|ci&s;ions become inflamed, red, thick, and hard; and from this time till the complete re&s;toration of the patient to perfect health; the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, which are often much inflamed, and from which a great deal of matter <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,
<PB N="141" REF="033718_0155_0FF916891C3C0AE8">ought to be repeatedly wa&s;hed every day with cold water.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh, eighth, or ninth day after the inoculation, the patient feels pains under the arm, and is attacked by head-ach, and fever; and &s;ometimes vomits.</P>
<P>This fever la&s;s two, three or four days, during which period the patient &s;hould not remain in bed, but, though it may be very inconvenient in the beginning, walk, or be carried about, where there is fre&s;h, pure, cool air, which is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>In free and cool air, the fever and head-ach go off; and if the forehead and arms be frequently wa&s;hed in cold wa|ter, almo&s;t all illne&s;s will go off.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, third, and fourth day of the fever, or the tenth, eleventh, or twelfth day after inoculation, &s;ome|times later, the &s;mall-pox come forth of their own accord: they ought not to be forced to make their appear|ance.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t ca&s;es there are few pu&s;tules, which, being good, the di&s;ea&s;e is &s;oon
