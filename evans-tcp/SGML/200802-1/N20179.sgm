<HEAD>EFFECTS of SLAVERY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE inju&s;tice of en&s;laving any part of the human race has been the &s;ubject of &s;o much public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and is &s;o generally ad|mitted by the inhabitants of Connecticut, that any attempt to prove it, would be a very ill compliment to the under&s;tandings of my en|lightened fellow citizens. Nor could any efforts of mine add nov|elty to the &s;ubject; &s;o numerous, elaborate and diffu&s;e have been the e&s;&s;ays, and &s;o powerful the eloquence employed in vindicating the violated rights of humanity, that language and rhetoric are exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>BUT men, in&s;tructed by their avarice in a &s;pecies of &s;ubtle ca&s;ui&s;|try, have learnt to make a material di&s;tinction between <HI>ab&s;tract rights</HI> and <HI>private intere&s;t or policy.</HI> In defending the African Slave trade, its advocates, compelled by the powers of rea&s;on to abandon the <HI>right,</HI> have taken refuge under the <HI>policy</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of the traf|fic. Here entrenched as in a &s;trong hold, they maintain their &s;ta|tion, and bid defiance to the attacks of rea&s;on and religion. To drive them from this citadel of defence, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to en|counter them with their own weapons, and upon their own ground.</P>
<P>As the only &s;teady, permanent and uniform &s;pring of men's ac|tions, is a regard to their &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;t, if we would effectually re&s;train them from the pur&s;uit of any object, we mu&s;t fir&s;t convince them that the object, if obtained, will not produce them the real benefit and happine&s;s which they expect. It is not &s;ufficient to per|&s;uade nations concerned in the &s;lave trade, that the practice of en|&s;laving their brethren of the human race, is barbarous and wicked, and that it is a violation of the laws of nature and &s;ociety. Previ|ous to their relinqui&s;hing the practice, they mu&s;t be convinced that &s;uch relinqui&s;hment will not be materially prejudicial to their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>To endeavor to prove this important truth, that <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> in all its forms and varieties, is repugnant to the private intere&s;t and pub|lic happine&s;s of man, is the ta&s;k I have a&s;&s;igned my&s;elf in this e&s;&s;ay though neither my talents nor my opportunities of acquiring the; nece&s;&s;ary information, will enable me to do ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject.
<PB N="6" REF="026448_0005_0FD055C9886FF538">
In taking this comprehen&s;ive view of the effects of &s;lavery on men and nations, the &s;ociety, to whom this treati&s;e is addre&s;&s;ed, will par|don me, if I do not re&s;trict my&s;elf to the con&s;ideration of the Afri|can &s;lave trade and the more immediate purpo&s;es of their in&s;titution; for the effects of de&s;poti&s;m and a violent re&s;traint of the natural lib|erty of man, are the &s;ame in all countries; &s;ubject however to in|con&s;iderable modifications from climate, &s;oil, religion, or other in|cidental circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>SLAVERY may be divided into, <HI>political</HI> and <HI>civil. Political &s;lave|ry,</HI> is a &s;ubjection to the uncontrolled exerci&s;e of public au|thority, whether that authority is in the hands of a king, a council, or a popular a&s;&s;embly. <HI>Civil &s;lavery</HI> is a &s;ubjection to the ab&s;olute power of a particular proprietor, or ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>SLAVERY al&s;o exi&s;ts in very different degrees in different coun|tries. In &s;ome countries, the &s;lave po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es by cu&s;tom, or enjoys by indulgence, &s;ome rights and privileges; in others, he is &s;trip|ped of all rights, and his &s;ervices, his per&s;on and his life, are at the arbitrary di&s;po&s;al of his ma&s;ter. But as I am not about forming a &s;y&s;tematic treati&s;e on this &s;ubject, the&s;e di&s;tinctions will not be pur|&s;ued; it being &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e to exhibit the <HI>general ef|fects of &s;lavery on men and nations.</HI></P>
<P>OF the effects of &s;lavery, the fir&s;t in order are tho&s;e which re&s;pect the <HI>character of the &s;lave;</HI> indeed mo&s;t of the pernicious con&s;equen|ces of &s;lavery, whether public or private, may be traced to this one &s;ource, the <HI>effects of an unnatural and an unwarrantable re&s;traint laid upon the will of the &s;lave.</HI></P>
<P>IT is evidently the will of heaven that men &s;hould be prompted to action by a regard to their own benefit and happine&s;s. Whenever by the po&s;itive in&s;titutions of &s;ociety, or by external force, men are &s;tripped of the power of exerting them&s;elves for their own benefit, the mind, having lo&s;t its &s;pring or &s;timulus, either cea&s;es to act, and men become mere machines, moving only when impelled by &s;ome extraneous power; or if the mind acts at all, it is at the impul&s;e of violent pa&s;&s;ions, &s;truggling to throw off an unnatural re&s;traint, and to revenge the injury. Hence it is, that &s;laves, with few excep|tions, may be divided into two cla&s;&s;es, the <HI>indolent</HI> and the <HI>villanous.</HI></P>
<P>IN America the lazine&s;s of &s;laves has become proverbial: indeed the blacks are &s;o remarkable for their inaction, their want of fore|&s;ight and their di&s;inoli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ation to improvement, as to create very great doubts in the minds of &s;ome men of a philo&s;ophical ca&s;t, whe|ther they are not a di&s;tinct and inferior race of beings.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Hume's E&s;&s;ays vol. 1. p. 550. Note. M. Jeffer&s;ons notes on Virgin|ia, p. 237.</NOTE> But on ex|amining this &s;ubject, and comparing the blacks of this country, with the &s;laves of other countries, who are confe&s;&s;edly of the &s;ame race with the mo&s;t improved European nation, it will probably be found that, making the u&s;ual allowances for the effects of their native climate, all the peculiar features in the character of the African race in America, may ju&s;tly be a&s;cribed to their depre&s;&s;ed condition.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="026448_0006_0FD055CB4A1EC260">
The indolence of the &s;laves in the &s;outhern &s;tates, mu&s;t indeed approach almo&s;t to &s;tupidity. It is &s;aid by gentlemen, well inform|ed on this &s;ubject, that three blacks will not perform more labor than one free white in the northern &s;tates.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MSS. letter from the hon. Dr. Ram&s;ay, of Charle&s;town South-Carolina.</NOTE> And it is well known that on every plantation, a negro driver is required, with his whip and his ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, to compel the reluctant &s;lave to perform his daily ta&s;k. But are American &s;laves only di&s;tingui&s;hed for their aver&s;ion to la|bor? Hi&s;tory teaches us a very different doctrine. Among the antient Germans, who, by their vigor and bravery, conquered half the world, &s;lavery had the &s;ame deba&s;ing &s;tupi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ying influence: and it is remarkable that the word, <HI>lazzi,</HI> which among our Saxon ance&s;|tors, was the denomination or the lowe&s;t order of bondmen or &s;er|vants, is the origin of our Engli&s;h word <HI>lazy,</HI> a word expre&s;&s;ive of that indolence and aver&s;ion to labor, which remarkably character|ize the negroes in America.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">From the &s;ame root have &s;prung the words <HI>lazaretto</HI> and <HI>lazzaroni,</HI> in the Italian language, the latter of which is the general name given to the idlers and beggars that &s;warm in Italy; and the former, is the name of the ho&s;|pitals erected for the &s;ick and infirm among tho&s;e mi&s;erable wretches. See Moor's Italy and Brydone's tour&punc; pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE> If &s;lavery had this effect upon our own ance&s;tors, the warlike heroes of the <HI>north,</HI> &s;urely modern philo|&s;ophers need not re&s;ort to an original difference of race, for the cau&s;e of that dullne&s;s and want of mental vigor, remarkable in the en|&s;laved natives of the <HI>torrid zone</HI> and their degenerate de&s;cendants.</P>
<P>But if we turn our eyes upon the pre&s;ent nations of Europe, we &s;hall find multiplied proofs of this important truth, that &s;lavery ne|ce&s;&s;arily enervates the vigor of the human mind, in all climates and among all nations.</P>
<P>In Poland, the pea&s;ants, who are &s;laves, are &s;o indolent that they do not furni&s;h them&s;elves even with a &s;helter from the inclemencies of the weather. The proprietor of the land to which the pea&s;ants are annexed, like the &s;tock of a farm, is obliged to build cottages and barns for them, and to furni&s;h them with &s;eed, plows, hor&s;es, and every implement of hu&s;bandry.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Coxe's travels into Poland, &amp;c. vol. 1. p. 160.</NOTE> Nor do the&s;e mi&s;erable wretches provide them&s;elves the ordinary comforts of life. Little more is to be &s;een within their hovels, than bare walls, a wooden &s;tool, and a bed of &s;traw. People who travel in that de&s;olate country, and ex|pect tolerable accommodations, mu&s;t carry with them their own beds, their provi&s;ions, their knives, forks and &s;poons.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibm. page 251.</NOTE></P>
<P>VERY little better is the condition of the pea&s;antry throughout the immen&s;e Ru&s;&s;ian empire.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibm. p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> So abject is their &s;ituation and &s;o complete the degradation of their minds, as to give ri&s;e to a general opinion in that country, that the pea&s;ants, if &s;et at liberty, would not be capable of procuring a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Ibm. vol. 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">45.</NOTE></P>

To what cau&s;e &s;hall we attribute this degeneracy of the Greeks? To what phy&s;i|cal energy? Surely no change of climate, no alteration in the pro|ductive powers of nature, can account for this moral phenomenon. To de&s;poti&s;m alone, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oul mon&s;ter, before who&s;e pe&s;tilential breath, the powers of the mind wither and decay, mu&s;t we a&s;cribe this woful deba&s;ement of the modern Greeks.</P>
<P>ANOTHER effect of &s;lavery upon its mi&s;erable &s;ubjects is to make them <HI>cruel, deceitful, per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">idious,</HI> and <HI>knavi&s;h;</HI> in &s;hort, to deprive them of all the noble and amiable affections of the human heart. This fatal and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of oppre&s;&s;ion upon the moral character of man, though often noticed by the hi&s;torian, the divine and philo&s;opher, has either e&s;caped the reflection of tyrants, or its admonitions have been hu&s;hed by the more commanding calls of a mi&s;taken &s;elfi&s;h policy. But proofs of this truth are &s;cattered over almo&s;t every page of hi&s;tory. We can &s;carely open a volume with|out finding &s;ome fact to convince us that <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion is the mother of crimes.</HI> So &s;triking was this truth in antient Greece, that a great philo&s;opher<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle, polit. lib. 1.</NOTE> doubted, whether there was any one virtue belonging to &s;laves. How can it be otherwi&s;e? Is it expectable that men, who are precluded by violence from enjoying the <HI>benefits</HI> of &s;ociety, &s;hould cultivate the <HI>virtues</HI> from which its ble&s;&s;ings flow? Is it not more natural that the &s;ubjects of oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;en&s;ible they are rob|bed of their rights and re&s;enting the injury, &s;hould perpetually &s;truggle to indemnify them&s;elves for the lo&s;s, and when it would be fruitle&s;s to u&s;e open force, that they &s;hould have recour&s;e to the arts of treachery and fraud? The principles of human nature war|rant this conclu&s;ion, and account for the dete&s;table character of &s;laves in all ages and all countries.</P>
<P>The Moors in Algiers and Morocco, are generally given to rob|bery and piracy; and people cannot travel in &s;afety at a di&s;tance from the towns in their country, without a marabout or reputed &s;aint, for a guard. The Turks in the &s;ame countries have not the &s;ame character. Why this difference? Has nature impre&s;&s;ed their different characters? A more &s;atisfactory an&s;wer is, that the Moors, con&s;idering them&s;elves the original proprietors of the countries, and by the conque&s;t of the Turks, reduced to a &s;tate of poverty and

<P>THE Malayan &s;laves in the Dutch plantations at the Cape of Good Hope, are very intelligent, but attrocious villains. To a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;inate their ma&s;ters is a common crime; and the culprit, who has committed it, marches to the &s;caffold with an air of unconcern; or rejoices that he has taken a &s;tep which will put an end to his life and his &s;ervitude.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Vailant's Travels Vol. 1. p. 56.</NOTE></P>

foes; to an indulgent one, faithful and affectionate &s;ervants. I am not per&s;onally acquainted with any &s;laves in Connecticut, who were born in Africa, and who arrived to manhood in their own country, before they were reduced to bondage. I have therefore had no opportunity to ob&s;erve what general difference exi&s;ts between the moral character of an African, en&s;laved after he had grown to years of manhood, and that of a black who was born and bred in &s;lavery. On general principles, it is to be pre&s;umed, that Africans, who are bred in freedom, and en&s;laved after they have acquired ha|bits of frankne&s;s and ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of deportment, will either re|tain through life a large portion of their early virtues; and if they attempt to redre&s;s their own wrongs, that they will be bold and man|ly in their attacks upon their oppre&s;&s;ors. Negroes, on the other hand, who are born and nur&s;ed under the pre&s;&s;ure of bondage, will be de&s;titute of that openne&s;s of character which marks the wild free|dom of &s;avages, and their minds will &s;ink into a &s;tate of &s;ullen apa|thy; or prompted to action by a &s;en&s;e of injury and re&s;trained by fear from open violence, they will exerci&s;e their ingenuity in devi|&s;ing and committing petty frauds on their ma&s;ters. However this may be, it is a known fact that the blacks in this country, are, with few exceptions, addicted to the practice of committing little clan|de&s;tine frauds, and a large proportion of capital crimes, will on ex|amination, be found to be perpetrated by the &s;ame race of men.

<P>Ho&s;pitality is the mo&s;t inartificial of all the virtues. It may be con&s;idered as <HI>natural,</HI> for its exerci&s;e flows immediately from in|&s;tinct.

In&s;tead of making im|provement, he will probably impoveri&s;h the land and leave the buildings and fences out of repair. The tenant at will has &s;till le&s;s intere&s;t in the land he occupies, and if, as in Turkey, he is &s;ubject to the arbitrary exactions of Pachas, Governors, landlords or collectors of revenue, who take his earnings from him at plea&s;|ure, he has no more encouragement to labor than the &s;lave, and of cour&s;e he will look no farther than to make provi&s;ion for the moment.</P>

<P>Ranging &s;till farther ea&s;tward, the eye re&s;ts upon the kingdom of Poland, where a complicated political and civil de&s;poti&s;m clouds and darkens the pro&s;pect. Until the reign of Ca&s;&s;imir the great, in the 14th century, a lord could put his pea&s;ant to death with impu|nity; and when the latter died without children, the lord con&s;ider|ed him&s;elf as his heir, and &s;iezed all his effects. Ca&s;&s;imir, in 1347, pre&s;cribed a fine for the murder of a pea&s;ant, and enacted that if one died without i&s;&s;ue, his next heir &s;hould inherit. But the&s;e &s;a|lutary laws, calculated to alleviate the mi&s;eries of the pea&s;antry, were eluded by the powerful and licentious nobles. It was not till 1768 that the &s;tatutes of Poland made it a capital crime to murder a pea&s;ant; and even now, it requires &s;uch an accumulation of evidence to convict the offender, that the law is rendered almo&s;t nugatory.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Coxe's travels vol. 1. 156. 158.</NOTE></P>
<P>What then mu&s;t be the &s;ituation of agriculture, arts and com|merce in Poland? What mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the appearance of the country, where <HI>men</HI> are thus treated like <HI>cattle?</HI> Let us hear the affecting de&s;cription of it given by that &s;en&s;ible and judicious tra|veller Mr. Coxe.

and &s;till le&s;s of a civilized country. Tho we travelled in the high road&punc; which unites Cracow and War&s;aw, in the cour&s;e of about 258 Engli&s;h miles, we met in our progre&s;s, only two carriages, and about a dozen carts. The country was equally thin of human habi|tations; a few &s;traggling villages, all built of wood, &s;ucceeded one another at long intervals, who&s;e mi&s;erable appearance corre&s;ponded to the wretchedne&s;s of the country around them.

We could &s;eldom procure any other room than that in which the family lived; in the article of provi&s;ion, eggs and milk were our greate&s;t luxuries and could not always be obtained; our only bed was &s;traw thrown upon the ground, and we thought our&s;elves happy when we could procure it clean. The natives were poorer, humbler and more mi&s;erable than any people we had yet ob&s;erved in our travels. Whenever we &s;top|ped, they flocked around us in crouds, and with the mo&s;t abject ge&s;tures, begged for charity."</P>
<P>Ca&s;ting our eyes, from this di&s;gu&s;ting &s;pectable, towards the im|men&s;e empire of Ru&s;&s;ia in the north, nearly the &s;ame di&s;mal ap|pearances are pre&s;ented to our view. The de&s;poti&s;m of a half-bar|barous nobility concurs with the arbitrary nature of the govern|ment, to pillage and deba&s;e the &s;erfs, and render them humble, ob&s;ti|nate, theivi&s;h, improvident and in&s;en&s;ible. Here indu&s;try is check|ed and di&s;couraged by the arbitrary exactions of the great proprie|tors of land, who&s;e power over their va&s;&s;als is without controul. A direct tax is laid upon the virtues of indu&s;try and frugality by a rapacious nobility, who a&s;&s;e&s;s their pea&s;ants in proportion to their &s;uppo&s;ed profits, tho the poor wretches are incapable of acquiring and holding property. Thus a ma&s;on or &s;mith, who is a good workman, is often rated as high as 6, 12 and even 20l. &s;terling a year. It is however &s;ome alleviation to a benevolent mind, to &s;ee the &s;overeigns of that almo&s;t boundle&s;s empire, exerting their power for the benefit of their &s;ubjects.

<P>From the frigid regions of Ru&s;&s;ia, let us ca&s;t our eyes &s;outh|ward over the va&s;t territories where the Turki&s;h Sultan, with the Koran and the Saber, impo&s;es law upon his numerous millions. Here the political pro&s;pect thickens into deep melancholy memphian

<P>Here &s;lavery a&s;&s;umes a different form. The conquered natives of the Ottoman dominions are not &s;ubject to a feudal &s;ervitude; they are not the <HI>ad&s;criptitii glebe</HI> of ancient Rome, or modern Po|land and Ru&s;&s;ia. But they are &s;ubject to the wor&s;t &s;pecies of bon|dage, the arbitrary and capricious exactions of numberle&s;s petty tyrants, the collectors of taxes and governors of provinces, who&s;e rapaciou&s;ne&s;s is re&s;trained by no &s;uperior power, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">precarious tenure of who&s;e offices tempts them to harra&s;s the people with im|moderate demands, that they may fill their own pur&s;es while the power is in their hands.</P>
<P>When Sultan Selim fir&s;t made a conque&s;t of Syria, in order to favor the hu&s;bandman, who&s;e worth he knew, he e&s;tabli&s;hed the <HI>miri,</HI> a territorial tribute, which was fixed at a certain rate that was not to be augmented or dimini&s;hed. This tribute was mode|rate, and had it not been for the abu&s;es of the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rki&s;h govern|ment, it never could have oppre&s;&s;ed the people. But the Pachas who have mo&s;t of the lands at their di&s;po&s;al, take care, when they make grants, to clog them with burthen&s;ome conditions; they ex|act the half or even two thirds of the crop; they monopolize the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eed and the cattle, &s;o that the cultivators are compelled to pur|cha&s;e from them at their own price. When the harve&s;t is over, they cavil about lo&s;&s;es and pretended robberies, and as they have the power in their hands, they carry off what they think proper. If the &s;ea&s;on fails, they exact the &s;ame &s;um, and to rai&s;e this they expo&s;e to &s;ale every thing the poor pea&s;ant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. Happily his per&s;on remains free, for the Turks are ignorant of the refinement of impri&s;oning for debt, when the man has no longer any property.</P>
<P>The&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions are con&s;tant, and to the&s;e is added a multitude of occa&s;ional extortions. Sometimes a whole village is laid under contribution for &s;ome offence, real or imaginary. A pre&s;ent is de|manded on the acce&s;&s;ion of each new governor; a contribution of gra&s;s is required for his hor&s;es, and of &s;traw and barley for his cavaliers, and all the &s;oldiers who pa&s;s mu&s;t be provided for by the poor pea&s;ants. The Villages tremble when a &s;oldier appears, as they would at the approach of a robber. He enters as a conquer|or and commands as a ma&s;ter; "<HI>dogs, rabble,</HI>" he cries, "<HI>bread, coffee, tobacco; I mu&s;t have barley, I mu&s;t have meat.</HI>" If he ca&s;ts his eyes on poultry, he kills them, and at his departure, he adds in&s;ult to tyranny. In vain do the pea&s;ants exclaim again&s;t this in|ju&s;tice; the &s;aber impo&s;es &s;ilence; ju&s;tice is remote and difficult of acce&s;s; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay complaints are even dangerous.</P>
<P>What is the con&s;equence of the&s;e depredations? The poorer

cla&s;s of inhabitants, ruined and unable to pay the tribute, for&s;ake the villages and fly to the cities. But the tribute of the village cannot be dimini&s;hed; the &s;um to be levied mu&s;t be found; the burthen therefore falls with accumulated weight on the remaining inhabitants, and becomes in&s;upportable. A two years drouth ruins the village, the inhabitants abandon it, and the tax it &s;hould have paid is levied on the neighboring lands.</P>
<P>It is remarked that the&s;e exactions have made a rapid progre&s;s, during the la&s;t 40 years, from which period the people date the decline of agriculture, the depopulation of the country, and the diminution of the Sultans revenue.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Volney's Travels. Vol. 2. Ch. 37.</NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the pea&s;ants is wretched beyond de&s;cription. They are every where reduced to a little cake of barley, onions, len|tils and water. In the mountains of Lebanon, they u&s;e acorns for food, after boiling or roa&s;ting them on the a&s;hes.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the mi&s;ery of the hu&s;bandman, and the preca|rious &s;tate of his property, cultivation is neglected. The farmer's plow is frequently no more than the branch of a tree, cut below a bifurcation. The country is tilled by a&s;&s;es and cows; rarely by oxen. On the borders of Arabia, the countryman, for fear of the wild Arabs, mu&s;t &s;ow with his mu&s;ket in his hand; and when his corn turns yellow, and before it is ripe he mu&s;t reap it and hide it in &s;ubterranean caverns. In a word, the indu&s;try of the country is limited to a &s;upply of immediate wants; to procure a little bread and a few onions, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wretched blue &s;hirt and a bit of woollen cloth. The pea&s;ant indeed lives in fear and di&s;tre&s;s, but it is a con&s;olation that he does not enrich his tyrants, and that the avarice of de&s;po|ti&s;m inflicts its own puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The arts, &s;ciences and commerce throughout the Turki&s;h empire have &s;hared the &s;ame fate as agriculture. The manufactures of the people are confined to a few articles of cloathing and arms, their reading extends only to the Koran, a few monki&s;h books and legen|dary tales, and their little commerce is in the hands of Franks, Greeks and Arminians. Mo&s;t of the harbors on the coa&s;t of Egypt, Syria, A&s;ia Minor, and the Greek I&s;lands, are choaked up with &s;and; the Levant is infe&s;ted with pirates; and the depopulation of &s;ome of the mo&s;t fertile provinces of the Ottoman empire, exhibits the fatal effects of the wide-wa&s;ting pe&s;tilential power of a fero|cious government.</P>
<P>Yet even in the dark and de&s;olate regions of tyranny, a few &s;cattering rays of liberty ari&s;e and cheer the melancholy pro&s;pect. On the barren mountains of Syria, between Lebanon and the val|ley of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">kaa, are the Maronites and Druzes, who have been able to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the iron rod of Ottoman power, on the ea&s;y condition of paying a &s;mall annual tribute to the neighboring Pachas.

<P>Proceeding to France, we behold the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;pectacle ever exhibited on the theater of this earth; a great and enlightened people &s;truggling, not only to break down the feudal and hierar|chal &s;y&s;tems of de&s;poti&s;m, but to exterminate their very principles, remove the gothic rubbi&s;h from their exten&s;ive territory, and pre|pare the &s;oil for the more generous plant of liberty.

<P>It has been &s;ugge&s;ted that the country may gradually be delivered from its black inhabitants by tran&s;porting a certain number of them to Africa every year, furni&s;hed with the nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence. A &s;ettlement of this kind has been already begun by a colo|ny from Great-Britain, under the &s;uperintendance of Mr. Clark&s;on. Indeed if colonial e&s;tabli&s;hments of this kind could be effected, without great injury to the United States, humanity and philo&s;o|phy would exult at the pro&s;pect of &s;eeing the arts of civilized na|tions introduced into the heart of Africa. But the practicability of this plan of colonization &s;eems to be yet problematical. It &s;eems not yet decided by the experiments made, whether &s;uch colonies would not dwindle away by di&s;ea&s;e, and be perpetually expo&s;ed to the ho&s;tility of the &s;urrounding natives. Indeed, it may be an im|portant que&s;tion, whether even well civilized blacks placed in the torrid zone, where little labor is requi&s;ite to procure their nece&s;&s;ary food and clothing, would not neglect all arts and labor, beyond what are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply immediate wants, and gradually revert back to a &s;avage &s;tate. How far a commercial intercour&s;e with &s;uch colonies, by exciting a ta&s;te for luxuries and the love of wealth and &s;plendor, would tend to pre&s;erve their habits of indu&s;try and prompt them to encourage arts and manufactures, we have perhaps no certain data from which we can draw even a probable conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But other objections oppo&s;e them&s;elves to the project of African colonization. Who is to pay the expen&s;e? The ma&s;ter will think the lo&s;s of his &s;laves a &s;acrifice on his part &s;ufficiently great, with|out furni&s;hing them with food, uten&s;ils, and &s;hipping for their tran&s;portation; and the &s;laves are not able to furni&s;h them&s;elves with the&s;e articles. The funds therfore mu&s;t be rai&s;ed by private &s;ub&s;criptions, or &s;upplied by government; and the&s;e re&s;ources cannot be relied on in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of America. Be&s;ides it is not certain that the &s;laves them&s;elves would be willing to ri&s;k &s;uch a change of &s;ituation; as mo&s;t of them are born in this country and are total &s;trangers to Africa and its inhabitants. In this ca&s;e, to compel them to quit the country, and encounter the dangers of the &s;ea, an in&s;alubrious climate and the ho&s;tile tribes of Africa; together with the ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of &s;tarving, would be a flagrant act of inju&s;|tice, inferior only to the fir&s;t act of en&s;laving their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The objection that the unhealthine&s;s of the climate renders it im|po&s;&s;ible for whites to cultivate rice and indigo plantations, and therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary to perform this bu&s;ine&s;s by blacks, &s;eems to be of little weight; or at lea&s;t, it cannot be of permanent duration. It is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed that the in&s;alubrity of the air in the &s;ou|thern &s;tates, ari&s;es in great mea&s;ure, from the &s;tagnant waters which cover the rice and indigo plantations. The&s;e waters indeed increa&s;e
<PB N="36" REF="026448_0035_0FD055F730B0FB28">
the evil; but the principal cau&s;e is a much more exten&s;ive one; the large mar&s;hes and va&s;t tracts of uncleared land in the flat coun|try. Mar&s;hes and &s;tagnant waters, in which vegetable &s;ub&s;tances putrify and di&s;&s;olve, produce pe&s;tilential exhalations; and when a country is mo&s;tly covered with fore&s;ts, the air it&s;elf becomes &s;tag|nant and does not carry off the noxious effluvia generated in low grounds. It is with the air as with water; its purity depends on its motion. To render any flat country healthy, it mu&s;t be clear|ed of its fore&s;ts, and laid open on all &s;ides to the action of the wind. It is not &s;ufficient to open here and there a plantation, and leave four fifths of the earth covered with wood. Be&s;ides the advantage of giving motion to the air on an extended plain, the clearing and cultivation of the earth lays it open to the &s;un, who&s;e heat warms and dries the &s;urface, and by removing the moi&s;ture, prevents the generation of noxious exhalations. Thus whenever mo&s;t of the land in the &s;outhern &s;tates &s;hall be cleared, the principal cau&s;e of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es will be de&s;troyed; and the free circulation of air near the &s;urface of the earth will render the putrid exhalations from the plantations and mar&s;h ground which cannot be drained, much le&s;s fatal. The New-England States, &s;ixty years ago, were infe&s;ted with the &s;ame annual fevers, which now prove &s;o trouble|&s;ome to the &s;outhern &s;tates, but by the clearing and cultivation of the earth, tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es no longer prevail. The rice fields in Italy and Spain, are all cultivated by white people, and tho they render the air about them le&s;s &s;alubrious than it is in other parts of the country, yet it is not &s;o fatal to the health of the people, as to di&s;courage the culture of that u&s;eful grain.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Bourgoanne's travels, vol. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>There is therefore no que&s;tion that a general and high &s;tate of cultivation will, to a great degree, correct the in&s;alubrity of the low flat country in the &s;outhern States, &s;o as to render it cultivable with white laborers; except perhaps in the vicinity of &s;uch &s;alt-mar&s;hes as cannot be drained. But the ob&s;tacles that pre&s;ent them|&s;elves to the project of <HI>colonization,</HI> and to that of a <HI>general &s;udden abolition</HI> of &s;lavery, appear to be equally in&s;urmountable. The blacks in the &s;outhern States mu&s;t, it is pre&s;umed, continue there, for a great number of years, perhaps forever; government at lea&s;t will not undertake the herculean ta&s;k of exporting them to a foreign country, and repeopling five or &s;ix States with white inhabitants.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The project of exporting all the blacks in the United States, would, if practicable, be attended with many de&s;ireable effects.

What then can be done? What method can be devi&s;ed for me|liorating the condition of the blacks, without e&s;&s;entially injuring the &s;lave, the ma&s;ter and the public. This is the great de&s;idera|tum. There appears to me only one plan or expedient for effecting this de&s;irable object, which, in its operation, will combine the three &s;everal intere&s;ts which are to be con&s;ulted; this is, to rai&s;e the &s;laves, by gradual means, to the condition of free tenants.</P>
<P>Indeed if we judge from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate of villanag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in many parts of Europe, it is no illfounded prediction, that &s;lavery in this country will be utterly extirpated in the cour&s;e of two centuries, perhaps in a much &s;horter period, without any extraordinary efforts to abol|i&s;h it. The negroes in the &s;outhern States are very nearly in the &s;ituation of the villains in England under the fir&s;t princes of the Norman line. They enjoy certain privileges, &s;uch as that of cul|tivating a &s;pot of earth for them&s;elves, on a certain day of the week, or that of performing a certain ta&s;k every day. To the&s;e privileges they adhere with pertinacious ob&s;tinacy. No power or per&s;ua&s;ion can prevail on a negro to plant or dig, in one day, more than a quarter of an acre of land, nor to labor for his ma&s;ter on a day which he has been accu&s;tomed to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ider as his own time. The &s;laves will therefore relinqui&s;h no privilege; but it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to prevent them from gradually acquiring new privileges, which they will immediately challenge as rights, and thus by de|grees abridge their ma&s;ters authority over them. The humanity of &s;ome ma&s;ters, the weakne&s;s or the policy of others will continu|ally be multiplying and enlarging the privileges of their &s;laves, till multitudes of them acquire &s;ome property, by which they will be able to purcha&s;e more ample exemptions from their ma&s;ters autho|rity, and finally to obtain their freedom. In this manner, and by various other means, the ancient villains of England obtained their freedom, and long before the abolition of military tenures under Charles 2, there were very few villains left in the nation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black. Com. Vol. 2, 96. Sullivan, Lecture 25.</NOTE> By &s;uch means, the &s;laves in the&s;e States would unque&s;tionably ri&s;e to the enjoyment of freedom, without any legi&s;lative provi&s;ion for the purpo&s;e. But this progre&s;s would be too &s;low to &s;atisfy the friends of humanity, in this enlightened period of the world; too &s;low for the &s;pirit of our governments, and too &s;low for our public pro&s;perity. It is therefore highly nece&s;&s;ary that public mea&s;ures and private &s;ocieties &s;hould lend their aid to accelerate the progre&s;s of freedom, and with all convenient &s;peed, bani&s;h the galling chains of bondage from the &s;hores of our Republic.</P>
<P>To the plan of rai&s;ing the &s;laves to the condition of free tenants, many objections may be rai&s;ed; but perhaps none of them will de|&s;erve an an&s;wer, except this; that if the &s;laves are &s;et at liberty, even with the offer of farms on a &s;mall rent, they will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> labor but will become vagabonds and &s;tarve, or betake them&s;elves to pilfering, and be a &s;courge to the country. This objection has weight, and as it re&s;pects a <HI>total</HI> and <HI>&s;udden emancipation,</HI> it appears
<PB N="38" REF="026448_0037_0FD055F98ACD7CD8">
to me in&s;uperable. But I cannot believe <HI>all</HI> the &s;laves in this country are &s;o dull that motives of intere&s;t will make no impre&s;&s;ion on their minds, or that they are &s;o unprincipled and ungrateful, that if &s;et at liberty, they would turn their hands again&s;t their ma&s;ters, and devote them&s;elves to an idle life and to &s;tealing. Some among them might be found, who, if their ma&s;ters would give them farms on a moderate rent, and their liberty, on condition of their being good tenants, would be prompted to indu&s;try, and exerci&s;e the virtues of hone&s;ty, and frugality. Every planter might find, among his &s;laves, a few perhaps of the young men, who&s;e habits are not firm|ly riveted, on whom the fir&s;t experiments might be made. Once in&s;pire them with a love of property, let them go to market for them&s;elves, accu&s;tom them&s;elves to make bargains, and begin to furni&s;h them&s;elves with clothes and food above their ordinary fare, and to build for them&s;elves convenient hou&s;es, and their want continually multiplying will beget habits of indu&s;try and economy. To prompt a &s;lave to exertion, his de&s;ires mu&s;t be inflamed, like tho&s;e of other men, with a pro&s;pect of enjoyments above tho&s;e of a &s;lave&mdash;he mu&s;t be in&s;pired with emulation; and to &s;uppo&s;e the negroes in America to be naturally de&s;titute of &s;uch de&s;ires, is contrary to hi&s;torical facts, and all the known principles of the human con&s;titution.</P>
<P>If a few &s;laves could be found on whom &s;ucce&s;sful experiments might be made, the ta&s;k would be half-accompli&s;hed; as example would have a powerful effect in exciting a &s;pirit of emulation. But to give &s;ucce&s;s to any efforts for this purpo&s;e, the &s;laves mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the &s;uperintending care and direction of their ma&s;ters or over&s;eers, as well as with the &s;tock and uten&s;ils nece&s;&s;ary for their farms. To put a man upon a farm, who has never had any will of his own, and who&s;e faculties, &s;ubject to perpetual compul|&s;ion, have never had an opportunity to unfold and exert them&s;elves, is like &s;ending children into the world to &s;eek their living; and to give him land to work on, without &s;tock or in&s;truments of hu&s;|bandry, would afford a very unpromi&s;ing pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>But the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays would be few and on a &s;mall &s;cale, &s;o that the proprietor need not be terrified at the expen&s;e, and after the fir&s;t difficulties &s;hould be overcome, the tenants would be able to furni&s;h them&s;elves with the nece&s;&s;ary means of managing their farms, and the profits would amply repay the proprietor.</P>
<P>It is to be wi&s;hed that &s;ome patriotic and humane gentlemen in the &s;outhern States would make effectual experiments upon their &s;laves, to determine how far a project of this kind will an&s;wer the double purpo&s;e of giving freedom to a mi&s;erable race of men, with|out injuring their owners and ob&s;tructing the cultivation of the country. No efforts of this kind have yet been made in America;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am informed by two very intelligent and re&s;pectable gentlemen, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hon.

from a failure of their own experiments; and the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;imilar attempts in Europe affords good ground of encouragement.</P>
<P>A glorious experiment of this kind has been made by Zamoi&s;ki, formerly great Chancellor of Poland, who in the year 1760, en|franchi&s;ed the pea&s;ants of 6 villages, in the palatinate of Ma&s;o|via. The &s;ucce&s;s de&s;erves to be particularly mentioned, as the pre|cedent is important, and &s;erves to confirm the principles here ad|vanced, that &s;lavery is pernicious to the morals, as well as to the indu&s;try and population of a country. On in&s;pecting the pari&s;h regi&s;ters of the&s;e villages, it appeared, that for ten years immediate|ly preceding their enfranchi&s;ement, the births amounted to 43 each year on an average; but in the fir&s;t ten years of their freedom, the births on an average, were 62 for each year, and in the &s;even following years they averaged 77. During the &s;ame period of 17 years, the income of this particular e&s;tate was tripled.</P>
<P>While the pea&s;ants were in a &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage, Zamoi&s;ki was obliged to build cottages and barns for them, and furni&s;h them with &s;eed, &s;tock and implements of hu&s;bandry. But &s;ince they have ac|quired their freedom, they are able to provide all the&s;e nece&s;&s;aries for them&s;elves, and pay an annual rent to the proprietor, in lieu of the per&s;onal &s;ervice which was formerly exacted.</P>
<P>In point of morals, the improvement of the pea&s;ants is equally re|markable. While they were &s;laves, they were frequently guilty of gro&s;s crimes, and &s;ometimes in a fit of drunkenne&s;s, would murder travellers. For &s;uch di&s;orders their ma&s;ter was obliged to pay a fine, called in the poli&s;h law, <HI>pro incontinentia &s;ubditorum.</HI> Since their emancipation, &s;uch di&s;orders have almo&s;t entirely cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Upon &s;igning the deed of enfranchi&s;ement, the benevolent Za|moi&s;ki expre&s;&s;ed to the pea&s;ants &s;ome apprehen&s;ions, that encour|raged by their freedom, they would fall into every &s;pecious of licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s, and commit more di&s;orders than when they were under the re&s;traints of a ma&s;ter's authority. The good &s;en&s;e of their an|&s;wer is worthy of particular notice; it was to this effect. "When we had no other property than the &s;tick which we hold in our hands, we had no encouragement to a right conduct; and hav|ing nothing to lo&s;e, we acted on all occa&s;ions in an incon&s;iderate manner; but as &s;oon as our hou&s;es, our lands, and our cattle be|come our own, the fear of forfeiting them will be a con&s;tant re|&s;traint upon our actions." The event has manife&s;ted the &s;incerity of the&s;e declarations, and the truth of the principles they contain. It has &s;ilenced the ill founded &s;urmi&s;es of the Poli&s;h nobles, who repre&s;ented their va&s;&s;als as too ungovernable to make a good u&s;e of their freedom.</P>
<P>Zamoi&s;ki, plea&s;ed with the thriving &s;tate of his free tenants, has enfranchi&s;ed the pea&s;ants on all his e&s;tates; and his example has been imitated by other noblemen with &s;imilar &s;ucce&s;s. Prince Stanislaus, nephew to the King of Poland, who&s;e mind has been im|proved by a re&s;idence in England, warmly patronizes the plan of giving liberty to the pea&s;ants. He has enfranchi&s;ed four villages near War|&s;aw, and conde&s;cends to direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t the pea&s;ants. He is &s;en&s;ible

that &s;lavery benums the faculties of the mind, and renders men unfit to plan and direct the cultivation of a farm. He therefore vi&s;its their cottages, &s;ugge&s;ts improvements in hu&s;bandry, in&s;tructs them in the mode of rearing cattle and bees, and points out the errors into which they are betrayed by their ignorance and incapacity. The en|crea&s;ing population and value, and the improved agriculture of the enfranchi&s;ed villages, the &s;uperior neatne&s;s and convenience of the cottages, and the ea&s;e, contentment and more orderly lives of the pea&s;ants, mark mo&s;t &s;trikingly the different effects of &s;lavery and freedom, and prove beyond cavil or controver&s;y that the freedom of the laborer is as advantagous to the proprietor of the farm, as it is be|nificial to the pea&s;ant and his country.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Coxe's travels into Poland, &amp;c. vol. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">.</NOTE></P>
<P>Why &s;hould not &s;uch illu&s;trious examples of the happy effects of liberty upon dome&s;tic and rural economy find imitators in Ame|rica? Will American planters &s;till object to &s;uch a liberal policy, the dullne&s;s of the faculties and the inferiority of the nature, of their &s;laves? Will they forever be the dupes of vi&s;ionary theories and a &s;uperficial philo&s;ophy?

For it mu&s;t be remem|bered that &s;lavery di&s;courages agriculture and manufactures, not only by taking from the laborer every motive that God and Society give him to prompt him to exertion, but by in&s;piring the great pro|prietors of lands with a contempt of all manual labor, and rendering <HI>di&s;reputable</HI> the very occupations from which they derive &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and wealth. Who could imagine that the feudal and papal &s;y&s;tems in Europe &s;hould have &s;o corrupted and perverted the minds of men, as to render low and degrading the noble employments of hu&s;bandry and manufactures; employments which, in the age of Homer, were the bu&s;ine&s;s of kings and queens; and arts the inven|tors of which were deified. A&s;toni&s;hing truth! The mo&s;t in&s;igni|ficant Baron of Europe, by a cu&s;tomary inver&s;ion of all ideas of dig|nity and propriety, affects to de&s;pi&s;e the occupations over which Ceres and Minerva once pre&s;ided with the rank of Godde&s;&s;es. By the e&s;tabli&s;hment of feuds and of the papal hierarchy, all ideas of primeval &s;implicity and purity of ta&s;te and manners were lo&s;t or corrupted; kings, prie&s;ts and monks engro&s;&s;ed all real property, and the military and &s;acerdotal profe&s;&s;ions alone became honorable. To &s;o low a condition were hu&s;bandry, manufactures and commerce reduced, that in the opinion of the nobility and higher orders of the clergy throughout Europe, a nobleman could not pur&s;ue either of tho&s;e occupations without degrading him&s;elf and forfeiting his rank. In a great part of Europe this opinion &s;till prevails, and in &s;ome countries, it is &s;upported by the laws. By a law of Poland, a noble|man is a man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a freehold, or who can trace his de&s;cent from ance&s;tors who formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a freehold e&s;tate; who has followed no trade or commerce and is at liberty to choo&s;e the place of his habitation: but if he follows any trade or commerce, he lo&s;es his title and is degraded.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coxe's Poland vol. 1. 136. 147. 149.</NOTE> By the laws and cu&s;toms of Spain, a principal proof of a man's title to nobility is, that he has never ex|erci&s;ed any of the &s;ervile profe&s;&s;ions, and to &s;uch and extreme is this ridiculous pride and contempt of bu&s;ine&s;s carried in &s;ome provinces, that even merchants are not permitted to attend the theater with the nobility.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">goa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e's Pre&s;ent State of Spain. vol. 2. p. 39.</NOTE></P>

in a greater or le&s;s degree, is ob&s;ervable in the We&s;t-Indies and in America, among the proprietors of &s;laves. By the prevalence of &s;uch fal&s;e notions, a country is doubly injured&mdash;the proprietor and all his family are rendered unproductive hands, and mo&s;tly u&s;ele&s;s&mdash;the &s;lave or cultivator, the mechanic and the trader are rendered le&s;s productive and u&s;eful hands, by being robbed of that honorable rank and e&s;timation among men which is the mo&s;t pow|erful &s;timulus to exertion, and which ought ever to be held up as a prize to reward hone&s;t indu&s;try. But the evil does not &s;top here: Such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">otions render a great portion of the actual capital of a State unproductive; for when men of bu&s;ine&s;s, have acquired fortunes, they a&s;pire to rank, relinqui&s;h their bu&s;ine&s;s, and purcha&s;e titles. Their property, in&s;tead of forming an active capital in trade or manufactures, is converted into real e&s;tate or funded &s;tock, or what is wor&s;e, loaned to foreigners, and the intere&s;t con&s;umed by this new fangled nobility, in idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation. Such is the prac|tice in many parts of Europe; and wherever this fal&s;e pride pre|vails, the productive occupations of life are neglected by the wealthy and well-informed who ought to be their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and who are the mo&s;t able to render them flouri&s;hing. The con&s;equence is, that the nobles them&s;elves are often poor, and their country is &s;till poorer; de&s;titute of arts, of indu&s;try and re&s;ources.</P>
<P>This contempt of bu&s;ine&s;s, wherever it prevails, is a mo&s;t &s;eri|ous calamity, as it &s;trikes at the very root of national indu&s;try, and con&s;equently of national wealth and power. A very little political arithmetic will &s;how the magnitude of this evil, in a &s;trong point of view. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that property, when employed in profitable undertakings, whether mercantile, agricultural or manufacturing, re&s;embles money at compound intere&s;t. If one hundred pounds produce &s;ix pounds clear profit in a year, and the proprietor &s;quanders away the &s;ix pounds at the end of the year, his capital &s;tock will never be enlar|ged. But if the &s;ix pounds of profit, at the years end, are added to the original &s;tock, the proprietor then has one hundred and &s;ix pounds as a capital for the &s;econd year. In this manner he pro|ceeds, adding his profits to his &s;tock, which is an operation pre|ci&s;ely &s;imilar to that of adding intere&s;t to principal which produ|ces compound intere&s;t. Let it then be &s;uppo&s;ed that in a &s;tate or kingdom, there are 10,000 families of nobility or planters, who cultivate their lands by means of &s;laves and who do not labor them|&s;elves. In 10,000 families, we may &s;uppo&s;e about 70,000 &s;ouls; one fourth or 17,500 adult males; and nearly the &s;ame number or 17000 females. Suppo&s;e every able bodied laborer to be worth 60 dollars by the year, which is the general hire of a laboring man in America; and every adult female to be worth 17 dollars a year, which is le&s;s than the actual value of female labor in America. The whole annual value of the labor of 17,500 men is 1, 050,000 dollars; and that of 17,000 females, 289,000, dollars, in the whole, 1,339,000 dollars. But to be very moderate in my calcu|lations, I will &s;uppo&s;e the annual value of the labor of 10,000 fami|lies to be only 1,300,000 dollars; and this &s;um to be employed and

augmented upon the principles of compound intere&s;t at 6 per cent. for one century. The re&s;ult would be that a &s;tock of 1,300,000 dollars would, in a century, produce upwards of four hundred and twenty millions of dollars. Ten thou&s;and idle families therefore in a State, would, upon a very moderate calculation, and in one century, make that difference in the value of the products of that State.</P>
<P>This e&s;timate &s;uppo&s;es that &s;tock will produce &s;ix per cent per ann, that no part of the &s;tock or produce is diverted from con&s;tant employment, and that the 10,000 families will produce hands enough, if employed, to work the whole &s;tock thro the whole peri|od. Whatever deductions may and ought to be made in fact from the re&s;ult of this calculation on account of circum&s;tances not taken into con&s;ideration, &s;till the proce&s;s will demon&s;trate the immen&s;e difference in the effects of freedom and &s;lavery, in regard to the wealth and power of a country.</P>
<P>But facts as well as calculations corroborate the&s;e principles. From the mo&s;t accurate accounts of the exports of &s;everal nations of Europe, together with the revenues and imports, we are war|ranted in this conclu&s;ion, that the actual produce of a country is nearly in an exact proportion to the degree of freedom enjoyed by its inhabitants. The &s;oil and climate of &s;ome countries are le&s;s favorable to indu&s;try than tho&s;e of other countries, and the roads and convenience for navigation may make a con&s;iderable differ|ence in the exports of different countries. But all the&s;e circum|&s;tances being equal, and the laboring people all enjoying equal freedom and encouragement, the exports of all countries would likewi&s;e be equal, as well as the internal con&s;umption. If every man had land or materials of his own, his whole indu&s;try would be exerted in producing, and his appetites would be fully gratifi|ed in con&s;uming his own productions; the &s;urplus would be ex|ported. The&s;e are true general principles as they re&s;pect nations. The exports of a country therefore are one of the principal crite|ria of the value of its productions. On this principle let us com|pare the indu&s;try of Spain and Poland with that of Great Britain and America. It will be admitted that the natural fertility of both Spain and Poland is equal, if not &s;uperior, to tho&s;e of Great Britain and America, and in point of conveniences for foreign commerce, Spain is not inferior to either. The following table will exhibit the number of Inhabitants in each nation, the annual value of the exports from each in Spani&s;h dollars, and what ought to be exported from Spain and Poland, if the inhabitants were as indu&s;trious, as tho&s;e of Great Britain and America.</P>

<P>This calculation m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t be very imperfect, becau&s;e the internal con|&s;umption is not known in any of the&s;e countries. But it may be fair|ly pre&s;umed from the mi&s;erable condition of the laboring people in Spain and Poland, that the internal con&s;umption of tho&s;e kingdoms is by no me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> equal to that of Great-Britain and America, in pro|portion to the number of inhabitants. Free people who rai&s;e an abundance of provi&s;ion, con&s;ume what they plea&s;e&mdash;&s;laves, if they are not limited in the <HI>quantity</HI> of their food and cloathing, are &s;till obliged to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on a few articles of coar&s;e cheap food. It is pro|bable therefore, if we could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">certain the value of the home produc|tions con&s;umed in the&s;e &s;everal countries, we &s;hould find the amount of the value of the whole produce of each country to be much more in favor of Great Britain and America, than the re&s;ult of the fore|going calculation.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>It may perhaps be enquired why, upon the&s;e principles, the exports of the United States of America, are not in proportion to tho&s;e of Great-Britain; as the inhabitants of America are at lea&s;t as free as tho&s;e of Great-Britain. Perhaps the internal con&s;umption in America, may partly account for this dif|ference; but a more &s;atisfactory an&s;wer is, that Americans almo&s;t all cultivate the earth, whereas a great proportion of the people in Great-Britain are man|ufactures; and it is a well known fact, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ewer laborers are required to produce a given value in manufactures from raw materials, e&s;pecially with the u&s;e of machines; than to produce the &s;ame value by the culture of the earth. The manufacturers of England alone, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be upwards of 4,000,000 per&s;ons or 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">7ths of its inhabitants, The profits of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ade in England, are e&s;timated to be from 8 to 10 per cent. on their capital &s;tock; and the pro|fits on manufactures &s;omething higher.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith's Wealth of Nations. Vol. 1. 9. and 10.</NOTE> Suppo&s;e them 10 per cent. and the intere&s;t of money five, the net profit is 6 per cent. which difference is im|men&s;ely in favor of that manufacturing kingdom; for lands in America do not produce 4 per cent. net profit; probably not three.</P><P>But there is a farther explanation of this apparent difference. The exports of Great-Britain con&s;i&s;t principally of manufactures&punc; But the raw materials of the principal Engli&s;h manufactures, are imported from other countries; and when the articles are entered for &s;hipment and exportation, the price of the raw materials is included with the price or value of the goods at the cu&s;|tom hou&s;e. Thus about &frac14; of the wool manufactured in England, is imported from Spain&mdash;25,000 tons of iron, which is wrought into hardware, all the cotton and &s;ilk which are manufactured are imported. The&s;e articles fur|ni&s;h the principal value of the exported manufactures.</P><P>In America the ca&s;e is different&mdash;almo&s;t all our exports con&s;i&s;t of articles produced in the country; provi&s;ions, raw materials, &amp;c. On the&s;e articles, there is only one advance; that upon the original labor and expen&s;e of pro|ducing them. But on the raw materials imported into Great-Britain, there are two advances&mdash;one to the nation producing them&mdash;and a &s;econd advance upon the labor and expen&s;e of manufacturing; to which may be added the freight and charges which are paid by the importer, and form a part of the fir&s;t co&s;t to the manufacturer, and on which like wi&s;e he has an advance. Suppo&s;e the &s;ine wool imported into Great-Britain from Spain, to be worth in the fleece, 1 <HI>&s;</HI> 6 &s;terling a pound; at this price 40,000 c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; which is about the quantity an|nually &s;ent to Great-Britain, will amount to 300,000l. Suppo&s;e this wool at the place of &s;hipment to be worth 20 per cent&punc; more, the value of this article to Spain may be e&s;timated at 300,000. Suppo&s;e the freight and charges to be 5 per cent; this wool will co&s;t the importer 390,000l.&mdash;and if the importer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not the manufacturer, the former mu&s;t al&s;o have his advance upon the wool; &s;o that the manufacturer will probably pay 420,000l. for this quantity of wool. He then works the wool into cloth; but in the proce&s;s, it goes through &s;everal hands, who all have a profit on their labour; and finally the articles manu|factured are exported&punc; with an advance or profit of 10 or 12 per cent. on the original value in the fleece, and on all the intermediate advances. To the&s;e circum&s;tances, it is probably owing that the exports of Great-Britain, exceed in value tho&s;e of America, in proportion to her inhabitants; and not to any &s;uperior indu&s;try of the nation. Perhaps al&s;o the minerals, tin and lead, may furni&s;h a greater value with a given portion of labor, than land. On this I am not qualified to decide; but England exports in the&s;e articles about 2&frac12; millions &s;terling annually. America exports no mineral productions worth notice. It is probable however, that the lands in England, produce more than in many parts of America, where the &s;ame labor is be&s;towed upon both. The high &s;tate of agricultural improvements in that country, warrants this conclu&s;ion. America was a wilderne&s;s 170 year ago; the whole country was covered with one immen&s;e fore&s;t. The land was to be cleared of enor|mous trees&mdash;fences were to be made&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oads opened&mdash;bridges built&mdash;hou&s;es and barns to be erected, before a &s;urplus of labor could be applied to pro|duce articles for exportation. New &s;ettlements &s;truggle many years with the&s;e difficulties, before they can procure a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and ac|commodations, and a con&s;iderable part of our inhabitants are yet in this &s;itua|tion. Lands in England, are lately rented at 20<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. &s;terling an acre&punc; but I be|lieve that little or none can be found in America, except for gardens, worth half the money. But whatever may be the productivene&s;s of Great-Britain, the enormous duties and taxes paid by the people, counterballance the bene|fits proceeding from their indu&s;try. All the yearly taxes, and public contri|butions in Connecticut, including duties on imports and all other charges, are con&s;iderably le&s;s than 2 dollars for every &s;oul. But the public contributions of all kinds in Great-Britain, amount to ten dollars a &s;oul. That is in Great-Britain, <HI>one fourth</HI> of the annual &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the people, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in du|ties tithes and taxes&mdash;in America, the public receives of each per&s;on, only <HI>one eighteenth</HI> of his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P></NOTE></P>

<CELL>39.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the printed report of the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury in 1791, from which the value of exports here u&s;ed is taken, there is mentioned a deficien|cy in the returns from South-Carolina and &s;ome &s;mall ports. This will make a &s;mall difference in favor of the &s;outhern &s;tates. At the &s;ame time it is pre|&s;umed this circum&s;tance is ballanced by the produce of Penn&s;ylvania export|ed from Maryland and Virginia. Maryland contains only <HI>one &s;ixth</HI> of the in|habitants, &s;outh of Penn&s;ylvania, yet its exports amount to <HI>one fourth</HI> of the whole exports &s;outh of that &s;tate, which circum&s;tance cannot be accounted for, by the greater fertility of its &s;oil or indu&s;try of its inhabitants. Indeed it is well known, that mo&s;t of the produce of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, from the Su&s;quehanna we&s;tward, is tran&s;ported &s;outhward to Baltimore and the Potomak, and there &s;hipped for foreign markets. But &s;hould it be found that the exports of the &s;outhern &s;tates equal tho&s;e of the northern, it would not be &s;urpri&s;ing, con&s;idering the &s;uperior profitablene&s;s of the principal articles rai&s;ed for exportation in the &s;outhern &s;tates. There are no con&s;iderable arti|cles in the northern &s;tates, which afford a profit, at all times, equal to that of rice, indigo and tobacco, e&s;pecially the two former. Be&s;ides, other circum|&s;tances are nece&s;&s;ary to form the ba&s;is of a ju&s;t calculation on this &s;ubject&mdash;&s;uch are the expen&s;e of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence or internal con&s;umption of home produce, the value of the imports, the balance of trade, the expen&s;es of each &s;tate in maintaining civil government, the clergy, &s;chools, roads, &amp;c. I have not materials for even a tolerable e&s;timate of this comprehen&s;ive kind. But it is certain the expen&s;es of &s;ome of the northern &s;tates are beyond compari&s;on greater than tho&s;e of the &s;outhern. I find the expen&s;e of maintaining the cler|gy in Virginia to be e&s;timated by Mr. Jeffer&s;on in his notes, at 25,000 dollars a year. Suppo&s;e it 30,000. The expen&s;e of the clergy in Connecticut, who are &s;upported mo&s;tly by taxes on their pari&s;hes, is about 65,000 dollars a year. Virginia contains 747,000 inhabitants&mdash;Connecticut 238,000, or le&s;s than a third of the number&mdash;the expen&s;e of the clergy therefore in Connecti|cut to that in Virginia, is very little le&s;s than <HI>&s;even</HI> to <HI>one.</HI> The expen&s;e of &s;chools likewi&s;e in the ea&s;tern &s;tates, will be found to exceed that of the &s;outhern, nearly in the &s;ame proportion. Many other articles of public expen&s;e are higher in the northern &s;tates. But there is a mo&s;t important difference &s;till to be remarked, between the northern and &s;outhern &s;tates. The &s;taple articles of export from the &s;outhern, are rice, indigo and tobacco. To the&s;e may be added the wheat of Maryland and Virginia, the tar and turpentine of N. Carolina, the cotton of S. Carolina and Georgia and the lumber of all. Of the&s;e articles the mo&s;t valuable furni&s;h a very &s;mall part of the immediate con&s;umption of the inhabitants. Almo&s;t all the rice, indigo, tobacco, tar, turpentine, and a great portion of the cotton, which are produced in tho&s;e &s;tates, are exported. So many hands are employed in cultivating the&s;e articles, that there are not mechanics and manufacturers &s;ufficient to furni&s;h the inhabi|tants with the nece&s;&s;ary uten&s;ils and clothing. A large portion of the hou&s;e|hold furniture, the farming uten&s;ils, carriages, &amp;c. of the &s;outhern &s;tates, are <HI>imported</HI>&mdash;whereas the&s;e articles are manufactured in the northern &s;tates and even <HI>exported.</HI> A great part of the clothing of the &s;laves is imported into the &s;outhern &s;tates&mdash;whereas the northern laboring people manufacture almo&s;t all their coar&s;e clothing. The &s;outhern &s;tates al&s;o import &s;everal articles of pro|vi&s;ion, as chee&s;e; &s;ome of them import beef and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ork, all which are <HI>exported</HI> from the northern to a con&s;iderable amount; not to mention wines and oth|er liquors, of which the &s;outhern &s;tates require a larger &s;upply than the north|ern. It is probable therefore, that a much <HI>greater proportion</HI> of the <HI>actual produce</HI> of the &s;outhern &s;tates is <HI>exported,</HI> than of the northern; becau&s;e a <HI>&s;maller proportion</HI> is con&s;umed by the inhabitants. This will very much re|duce the value of the real products of the &s;outhern &s;tates. For example, &s;up|po&s;e the northern &s;tates to export the value of 10 millions annually, and to con&s;ume of their own productions the value of 70 millions, which is about the actual con&s;umption, they then import the value of 10 millions in money or goods, and the whole produce is 80 millions. Suppo&s;e the &s;outhern &s;tates to export al&s;o the value of 10 millions, and to con&s;ume of their own productions only 65 millions value, the <HI>whole produce then is only 75 millions.</HI> This &s;tate|ment is probably &s;upported by facts; and there is no que&s;tion that with all the advantages of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ils, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itted to produce the mo&s;t profitable articles of com|merce in the vegetable kingdom, except the &s;ugar cane, the &s;outhern &s;tates produce much le&s;s in proportion to their population than the northern. In|deed when we take into con&s;ideration the great numbers of idle and unpro|ductive hands in the &s;outhern &s;tates, we &s;hall not be &s;upri&s;ed at the fact. The family that cultivates by &s;laves is unproductive it&s;elf and all its dome&s;tics.

<P>Similar calculations may be made with re&s;pect to many other countries, and the re&s;ult in every in&s;tance, will be demon&s;trative of the happy effects of freedom. The mo&s;t luxuriant &s;oil and the mo&s;t &s;alubrious climate are advantages, which, in no country, counterballance the tendency of &s;lavery, feudal and dome&s;tic, to weaken and impoveri&s;h a country.</P>
<P>Slavery is equally ho&s;tile to population, as to national indu&s;try and enterprize. A country parcelled out into large e&s;tates is al|ways thinly &s;ettled, unle&s;s it has &s;ome peculiar natural advantages, or abounds with manufacturers or merchants.

England vindicated her rights at an earlier period, and has become proportionably richer.</P>
<P>Facts of this kind can be neither evaded, nor contradicted; their evidence is conclu&s;ive and irre&s;i&s;table; they demon&s;trate the doc|trine before advanced, that "&s;lavery in all its forms and degrees, is repugnant to the private intere&s;t and public happine&s;s of man."

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>From the&s;e e&s;timates, which are founded on the be&s;t documents and mo&s;t judicious opinions that I have been able to obtain, it ap|pears that the total of public contributions in Connecticut ari&s;ing under the laws of the State (including the expen&s;e of books and &s;tationary for &s;chools, which can hardly be con&s;idered as <HI>public expenditure</HI>) is only 94 cents to each &s;oul, or <HI>&s;ix</HI> dollars and <HI>eleven cents</HI> to each family of 6&frac12; &s;ouls.</P>
<P>It appears al&s;o that all public contributions under the <HI>laws of the State</HI> are very little more than <HI>one fortieth</HI> part of the annual produce. To the&s;e mu&s;t be added the duties of impo&s;t and exci&s;e paid to the <HI>national</HI> government, which amount to about <HI>one dollar</HI> a head throughout the United States. Each family then pays annu|ally to the State and General governments 12 dollars 61 cents, which, on an e&s;tate of 1166 dollars, the average value of e&s;tates in Connecticut, is a little more than <HI>one per cent;</HI> or one <HI>twentieth</HI> of the annual produce.</P>
<P>If to the foregoing amount of expenditures in Connecticut, we add half a million of dollars for the annual net profit of the labor of the State, we &s;hall have &s;omething more than <HI>nine millions</HI> of dol|lars for the <HI>annual value</HI> of the <HI>productive labor</HI> of the inhabitants. This is more than a <HI>fifth part</HI> of the value of the property, real and per&s;onal, of the whole State. The re&s;ult is, that the whole value of the real and per&s;onal property is reproduced in le&s;s than <HI>five years.</HI></P>
<P>The real e&s;tate of Connecticut is &s;tated above at 30,770,000
<PB N="52" REF="026448_0051_0FD0560E8AEAF7B8">
dollars; to which add the &s;tock of the farms, 3,600,000, and for the value of uten&s;ils of all kinds, 630,000 and the total amount is 35,000,000 dollars. The exports of the State, being principally the produce of the earth, amount to about 1,150,000 or probably &s;omething more. The annual exports then amount to a fraction more than 3 per cent of the value of the real e&s;tates, &s;tock of the farms and uten&s;ils; and nearly to 2&frac34; per cent of the whole prop|erty of the State.</P>
<P>If the value of the whole annual produce of the State is nine millions, and the exports 1,150,000, the exports are a little more than &frac18; of the whole produce; the other <HI>&s;even parts</HI> of the eight remain for home con&s;umption.</P>

<HEAD>No. III.</HEAD>
<P>It has been &s;hown that the Inhabitants of Connecticut contribute le&s;s than two dollars a head for all public purpo&s;es. Let this fact be compared with the &s;tate of taxes in Great Britain.</P>
<P>The annual revenue of Great Britain is &pound;16,000,000 &s;terling or nearly 71,000,000 dollars.</P>
<P>Taxes for the &s;upport of the poor &pound;2,000,000 &s;terling or near|ly 8,888,000 dollars.</P>
<P>The tithes nearly &pound;3,000,000 &s;terling or 13,332,000 dollars.</P>
<P>Total 93,220,000 dollars.</P>
<P>Other public contributions are not known and omitted.</P>
<P>This &s;um divided among the inhabitants of Great Britain (Ireland is not included) who are e&s;timated at 8,500,000, gives 10 dollars 95 cents to each per&s;on, and 65 dollars, 70 cents to a family of &s;ix &s;ouls.&mdash;</P>
<P>This is within a &s;mall fraction, &s;ix times as much as is paid in Connecticut, where public charges are probably as high as in any State in the Union. If many other public charges in Great Bri|tain are added the calculation will be nearer the truth, and much more in favor of our own country.</P>
<P>The expen&s;e of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in Great Britain is there e&s;timated at <HI>&s;ix pence</HI> &s;terling a day for each per&s;on, including all de&s;criptions of people&mdash;This amounts to 40 dollars in a year. More than a <HI>fourth part</HI> of this &s;um is paid to Government, to the clergy and the poor; whereas in Connecticut the public contributions amount only to 1-18th of the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of each per&s;on, e&s;timated at 35 dollars.</P>

<HEAD>No. IV. OF PRODUCTIVE LABORERS.</HEAD>
<P>That &s;tate of &s;ociety and that form of government that render the greate&s;t proportion of the inhabitants <HI>productive</HI> laborers, are be&s;t calculated to make a nation pro&s;perous, wealthy and powerful; and <HI>e conver&s;o,</HI> the greater number of <HI>unproductive</HI> hands among the people, the poorer and more feeble will they be <HI>as a nation,</HI> tho in|dividuals may po&s;&s;e&s;s immen&s;e property.</P>

<P>From a &s;urvey of the inhabitants of Connecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut, it is pre&s;umed there are not 4000 <HI>unproductive</HI> adults among the whole number of 238,000; which is about 1 to 60.</P>
<P>I know not the whole number of familes in the five &s;outhern &s;tates in America that po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;laves; but &s;uppo&s;e 10,000 &s;uch fam|ilies, which is probably a moderate &s;uppo&s;ition. In each of the&s;e families may be 6 whites and 6 black menial &s;ervants, all of whom are <HI>unproductive.</HI> Of the&s;e 12 &s;ouls in a family, 4 may be children incapable of much labor; there will then remain 8 adults to a fami|ly, or 80,000 unproductive adults in the 10,000 families. If we then &s;uppo&s;e all the other unproductive adults in tho&s;e &s;tates to be 20,000, the whole number will be 100,000, which is nearly 1 to 18 of all the inhabitants of tho&s;e <HI>five</HI> &s;tates. This circum&s;tance alone would make an immen&s;e difference between the productive labor of tho&s;e &s;tates, and that of the northern. And this is one principal cau&s;e of the poverty of the feudal and Roman Catholic countries in Europe. Princes and nobility, with all their retainers and depen|dants, together with the <HI>regular</HI> clergy and an undue proportion of the <HI>&s;ecular,</HI> are all <HI>unproductive.</HI> One certain pernicious effect of &s;lavery, then is to fill a country with an undue proportion of un|productive people; for the ma&s;ter and all his family become idlers. Not only &s;o, but in America at lea&s;t, it is a further di&s;couragement to indu&s;try, by preventing the introduction of <HI>free</HI> laborers; few freemen being willing to labor with &s;laves.</P>
<P>The hire or net profit of a free laboring man in New-England, is 60 dollars a year. The hire of a &s;lave in Virginia, is only 40 dol|lars, even on a tobacco plantation; yet tobacco is a more profitable article, than the produce of New-England. This circum&s;tance &s;hows the &s;triking difference in the value of the labor of freemen in New-England and &s;laves in Virginia. The &s;ame difference exi&s;ts in Virginia, for a free white cannot be hired for a year at le&s;s than 60 or 70 dollars.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter from the Hon. Mr. Maddi&s;on.</NOTE></P>
<P>The average expen&s;e of feeding and clothing male laboring &s;laves in Virginia, is 18 dollars a year, which added to his hire, makes the annual value of his labor 58 dollars. But a laboring man in New-England, at the lowe&s;t value of the provi&s;ion and clothing, con&s;umed by people of that de&s;cription, cannot be maintained for le&s;s than 50 or 60 dollars a year. The whole value of the labor of a free white in New England, is therefore at lea&s;t&punc; 10 dollars a year.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">To a&s;certain the exact value of the labor of a hired man, his clothing mu&s;t be deducted from the foregoing &s;um&mdash;a hired man is furni&s;hed by his employer with <HI>food</HI> and <HI>lodging,</HI> but he furni&s;hes his own <HI>clothing</HI> out of his wages. Deduct 20 or rather 25 dollars for clothing, and the actual profit of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aboring man in New-England, is 85 or 90 dollars a year.

little more for the boarding of a man, which is too low. It is pre|&s;umed the diet of every family in New-England, including men, women and children, ri&s;es nearly to half a dollar a head. E&s;timat|ing the board and lodging of a male laborer at 5-6ths of a dollar by the week, which may be &s;afely done, and his hire at 60 dollars a year, and his labor is worth 103 dollars and a third, which is nearer the truth.</P>
<P>When we take into con&s;ideration, the fir&s;t purcha&s;e of a &s;tock of &s;laves, the ri&s;k of their life and health, the expen&s;es of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and over&s;eers, with the lo&s;s of property by their negligence and thievi&s;hne&s;s, we &s;hall find this much the mo&s;t expen&s;ive mode of cultivation, A few articles only, as rice, indigo, cotton and the &s;ugar cane, will bear the expen&s;es. But when we add the extrava|gance and profligacy occa&s;ioned among the proprietors by this mode of cultivation, all calculation mu&s;t cea&s;e.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid in the foregoing e&s;&s;ay, that it is probable the internal con&s;umption of produce in the &s;outhern &s;tates, is much le&s;s than in the ea&s;tern and northern.</P>
<P>The e&s;timated annual charge of &s;upporting a male laboring &s;lave in Virginia, is 18 dollars. The expen&s;e of &s;upporting children mu&s;t be much le&s;s&mdash;but I will include children, and &s;uppo&s;e 18 dollars a head to be the annual charge of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and clothing. Virginia conta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s 292,000 &s;laves, who, at 18 dollars each, con&s;ume the value of 5,256000 dollars.

Then 292,000 free per&s;ons in the north|ern &s;tates annually con&s;ume property to the amount of 10,220,000 dollars. This difference of expence or internal con&s;umption being 4,964,000 dollars, on le&s;s than 300,000 &s;ouls, &s;hows the difference between the products of the northern and &s;outhern &s;tates; for it is not &s;uppo&s;eable that the amount of the difference is con&s;umed up|on the luxuries of a few planters. The expence of maintenance in S. Carolina is much higher, becau&s;e of the higher prices of provi|&s;ion and clothing; at the &s;ame time, the culture of the rice and indigo is much more profitable. The annual exports of the &s;outh|ern &s;tates are le&s;s than tho&s;e of the northern, in proportion to the number of inhabitants, by the difference of 720,000 dollars. But taking into con&s;ideration, the immen&s;e difference in the expen&s;e of maintaining &s;laves, which makes the difference of internal con&s;ump|tion, and there is little doubt that the actual yearly produce of the &s;outhern &s;tates, in proportion to the number of &s;ouls, is le&s;s than that of the northern by the difference of 5, 6 or 7 millions of dollars.</P>

Then 60 barrels at 3<HI>&s;</HI>6&mdash;10l. 10s. or 35 dollars, which is the principal expen&s;e of food for a family.</P>
<P>The cloathing of the Iri&s;h Cottars is trifling, the children are al|mo&s;t naked great part of the year&mdash;and adults are often without &s;hoes and &s;tockings&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e the clothing and additional food of a family to be 45 dollars a year, then 80 dollars is the amount of the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of a family of 6&frac12; &s;ouls&mdash;which is nearly 12 1-3 dollars a head&mdash;Suppo&s;e it 14 dollars a head then the annual &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence of 2 millions amounts to 28,000,000.</P>
<P>That this e&s;timate is near the truth is evident from the price of labor in Ireland; which, for a male laborer, amounts, on an ave|rage thro the year, to &s;ix pence halfpenny &s;terling a day&mdash;Deduct|ing Sundays and three holidays only, there remain 310 days for labor. Suppo&s;e every man to labor 310 days in the year; the amount of wages of a day-labourer at 6&frac12; &s;terling is l. 8. 6s. 11d. or 38 dollars nearly. In two families of 6&frac12; &s;ouls each or 13 per|&s;ons, there will be found 3 male adults&mdash;3 female do. 4 young per&s;ons under adult years and 3 children.</P>

<P>Then 13&ratio;191&proportion;2,000,000&ratio; 29,384,615 dollars, the value of the labor of 2 millions of the pea&s;antry in Ireland.&mdash;Sup|po&s;e them to con&s;ume the whole, and call the whole, for the &s;ake of round numbers 30 millions&mdash;Then add 20 millions more for the value of the labor of the manufacturing part of the kingdom, &amp;c. (which is much more than the real value) and we have 50 millions of dollars for the annual value of the labor of Ireland, and the Con|&s;umption of its 3 millions of inhabitants, which will be the full amount of its products. But the produce and con&s;umption of 3 millions of people in the United States according to the rate of con&s;umption in Connecticut, would be 105 millions. This cal|culation, it is pre&s;umed, is very favorable to Ireland, and corrobo|rates, in a &s;triking degree, the doctrine I have advanced of the &s;u|perior productivene&s;s of the labor of freemen who work for their own benefit.</P>

<HEAD>MANNER of LIVING in CONNECTICUT,</HEAD>
<P>The laboring people eat and drink whatever they plea&s;e. Their ordinary and con&s;tant food con&s;i&s;ts of pork, beaf, veal, mutton, poultry (they u&s;ually eat meat at every meal&mdash;but always twice a day) milk, bread, &s;ometimes of pure wheat, but more commonly of wheat and rye, or rye and indian corn mixed together; butter and chee&s;e, potatoes and other vegetables. The common laboring peo|ple, worth from 500 to 1000 dollars are as fully &s;upplied with the&s;e articles, as the riche&s;t nobleman in Europe. They al&s;o con&s;ume large quantities of tea, &s;ugar, coffee, mola&s;&s;es, and other foreign articles. Their drink is principally cider; but much rum is al&s;o con&s;umed. Their cloathing con&s;i&s;ts of coar&s;e woollen and linens of their own manufacture mo&s;tly; with a &s;iner &s;uit for holidays.</P>
<P>Let this &s;ituation of the laboring people in Connecticut, (and all the people of the northern &s;tates are in nearly the &s;ame circum&s;tances) be contra&s;ted with the condition of the &s;laves in the &s;outhern &s;tates, and of the poor in great part of Europe; and let humanity and be|nevolence decide, whether liberty or &s;lavery is the mo&s;t eligible, and whether a general revolution in the governments of the old world is not a de&s;irable event. If that nation is the happie&s;t, which with indu&s;try enjoys a full &s;upply of the comforts and conveniencies of life, then that government and tho&s;e in&s;titutions which di&s;tribute and &s;ecure to the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> number of people the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> portion of the&s;e enjoyments, will forever be the <HI>be&s;t.</HI></P>
