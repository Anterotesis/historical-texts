<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Influenza made its appearance here the la&s;t week in July, and the fir&s;t ca&s;e of the Malignant Fever that has been ob&s;erved was about the 3d of Augu&s;t, in Water-&s;treet, between Arch and Race-&s;treets, where it has &s;ince raged with greater violence, and occa&s;ioned a much greater proportion of mortality than in any other part of the city.</NOTE> THE Fever at pre&s;ent prevailing in the city of Philadelphia (which is highly in|fectious and malignant) generally begins with, and may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from every other &s;pecies or form of fever, by the following &s;ymptoms, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="025366_0003_0FCD0DC96E51AE68">
THE patient fir&s;t complains of wearine&s;s and weakne&s;s, which, in a few hours, is &s;uc|ceeded by a &s;en&s;e of chilline&s;s, and an oppre&s;|&s;ive dull pain and giddine&s;s in the head, an oppre&s;&s;ive weight and &s;tricture about the brea&s;t, particularly at the region of the heart, as if the &s;pace was too narrow for its pul&s;ations. The breathing is performed with quickne&s;s and unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>THESE &s;ymptoms in mo&s;t ca&s;es, are &s;oon &s;ucceeded by a frequent propen&s;ity to puke, and this by a quick, full, but &s;oft and irregular pul&s;e; great heat about the head, neck, and brea&s;t; the &s;kin generally hot and moi&s;t a|bout the neck and forehead, but dry, and but little increa&s;e of heat about the feet and legs.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The violence of the &s;ymptoms generally remit every morning.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF, to the&s;e &s;ymptoms, we add an extraor|dinary pro&s;tration of &s;trength or &s;udden de|bility in the animal functions of the body, we have a perfect de&s;cription of the fever un|der con&s;ideration, from the fir&s;t day of its at|tack to the third of its progre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="025366_0004_0FCD0DCBAD4E4C10">
WHEN no amendment takes place by the 3d or 4th day, mo&s;t of the recited &s;ymptoms become more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and alarming, with the pul&s;e low and &s;unk. Frequent vomiting of matter re&s;embling coffee grounds in colour and con&s;i&s;tence, generally occurs before the di&s;ea&s;e terminates, when it proves mortal, to|gether with a cadaverous appearance of the countenance, &s;ucceeded by a deep yellow or leaden colour of the &s;kin and nails; the eyes become &s;uffu&s;ed with blood, and the counte|nance appears like that of one &s;trangled; but no &s;igns of jaundice appear, either in the urine or feces. In &s;ome ca&s;es, a profu&s;e di&s;charge of blood from the no&s;e, concludes the cata&s;tro|phe&mdash;A hiccup is a very frequent but not a con&s;tant &s;ymptom, nor does vomiting al|ways occur. The tongue is &s;eldom very &s;oul or dry, nor does the patient always crave drink. His intellects, though always con|fu&s;ed, are &s;eldom &s;o much di&s;ordered as to amount to a delirium&mdash;Sub&s;ultus tendinum are very rare.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="025366_0005_0FCD0DCD289B7648">
WHEN the di&s;ea&s;e terminates favourably, the &s;ymptoms generally abate on the third or fourth day, accompanied by a profu&s;e &s;weat. When it ends fatally, it is generally between the fifth and eighth day, though &s;ome have &s;urvived the tenth, and died afterwards.</P>
<P>THE characteri&s;tic or leading &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, as has already been ob&s;erved, are &s;udden debility in the voluntary powers, oppre&s;&s;ive pain, giddine&s;s and &s;en&s;e of full|ne&s;s and di&s;tention in the ve&s;&s;els of the fore|part of the head, and an oppre&s;&s;ive weight, or an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;en&s;ation of tightne&s;s about the heart and lungs, accompanied with ex|cruciating angui&s;h and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS fever, like all other varieties of pu|trid fever, ari&s;es from, and is produced by &s;pecific contagion, and may be communicated from tho&s;e labouring under the di&s;ea&s;e, to per&s;ons in the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of health.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="025366_0006_0FCD0DD0E325B9F8">
How the di&s;ea&s;e was introduced into the city, whether imported from &s;ome other country, in con&s;equence of the contagion ad|hering to goods or to the apparel of di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons, which is the mo&s;t common &s;ource from whence infectious di&s;ea&s;es are communi|cated, or generated in the low and filthy a|partments of &s;ome of the inhabitants of Water-&s;treet, can only be determined by a collection and faithful &s;tatement of facts, and mu&s;t be left for future inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>IT ought, however, to afford us much con|&s;olation, when we are a&s;&s;ured, (and on this a&s;|&s;urance we may rely with the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity) that the di&s;ea&s;e under con&s;ideration, though certainly infectious is neverthele&s;s on|ly communicable under particular circum&s;tan|ces. Tho&s;e circum&s;tances removed, no in|fection can po&s;&s;ibly take place.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e that the air in the &s;treets can be contaminated by the contagion &s;o as to com|municate the di&s;ea&s;e through that medium, is
<PB N="8" REF="025366_0007_0FCD0DD1ACB74FB8">
contrary to, and is contradicted by, the ob|&s;ervations and experience of the learned of the faculty of every age and country; and any apprehen&s;ion of an infectious di&s;ea&s;e from that &s;ource, can only be excu&s;ed in tho&s;e who have not had &s;uitable opportunities of better information.</P>
<P>BURNING heaps of odorous and noi&s;om &s;ub&s;tances in the &s;treets is therefore not only u&s;ele&s;s, but injurious, as it not only con|&s;umes or changes the quality of the pure or vital air of the atmo&s;phere, but conveys into it from the burning materials, a proportiona|ble quantity of deleterious gas, commonly call|ed fixed air.</P>
<P>PEOPLE in walking the &s;treets, are by no means in any danger of infection, as the mi|a&s;mata, or contagious exhalations from the bo|dies of the di&s;ea&s;ed have never been known to be conveyed by the air many feet beyond the chamber of the &s;ick, except by means of clothes or other porous &s;ub&s;tances which have
<PB N="9" REF="025366_0008_0FCD0DD3314EE108">
been in contact with, or very near to, the body of one labouring under the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE principal, and perhaps the only cir|cum&s;tances which render the pre&s;ent fever communicable, if analogy and pa&s;t experi|rience are to have any weight, are the follow|ing, viz. Confinement for any length of time in the bed-chamber of the &s;ick, e&s;peci|ally when the apartment is not large, and freely ventilated&mdash;coming in immediate contact with the patient, his body, or bed-clothes, or tho&s;e of the nur&s;e or other attend|ants before they have been for &s;ome time ex|po&s;ed to the action of the open air, or by re|ceiving the breath, or the &s;cent of the &s;everal excretions of the &s;ick.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Expo&s;ure of the apparel of the infected to the open air &s;ome days, and afterwards baking it in an oven for a few hours effectually removes any ri&s;k of di&s;ea&s;e from that &s;ource.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF people rigorou&s;ly &s;hun the above cir|cum&s;tances, pay a &s;trict attention to cleanli|ne&s;s;
<PB N="10" REF="025366_0009_0FCD0DD52B6C60F8">
to con&s;tant ventilation of their own as well as the apartments of the &s;ick; take mo|derate and frequent exerci&s;e in the open air when dry and &s;erene; make moderate u&s;e of reli&s;hing aliment copiou&s;ly &s;ea&s;oned with &s;alt and culinary &s;pices, and drink wine or other &s;trong liquors more liberally than cu&s;tomary; avoiding intemperance of every de&s;cription; but above all, the mon&s;trous and abomina|ble vice of getting drunk&mdash;I venture to pro|nounce with the mo&s;t po&s;itive confidence, that the di&s;ea&s;e will not, cannot &s;pread.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the various expedients made u&s;e of by all cla&s;&s;es to pre&s;erve them|&s;elves from infection, &s;uch as camphor bags, amulets of dried frogs, tarred ropes, &s;punge dipped in the vinegar of the four thieves, the &s;alt of &s;pices (as it is vulgarly called) the &s;moaking of &s;egars&mdash;they are productive of more evil than good, becau&s;e they continually attract the mind to one melancholy object, and &s;erve to keep alive fearful apprehen&s;ions,
<PB N="11" REF="025366_0010_0FCD0DD8D5975418">
which might otherwi&s;e be diverted by other objects and a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new ideas.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t, and I believe I may &s;ay the on|ly neutralizer or corrector of contagion yet di&s;covered, is the pure vital air of the atmo&s;|phere. The putrid noxious effluvia confined in tombs and vaults (than which few things are more &s;uddenly fatal to life) has been ren|dered perfectly innocent by the copious ad|mixture of vital air, or that portion of the at|mo&s;phere which &s;erves the purpo&s;e of re&s;pi|ration and combu&s;tion.</P>
<P>THIS &s;alubrious aeriform fluid may there|fore be mo&s;t u&s;efully employed for re&s;toring to health the unfortunate &s;ufferers under the pre&s;ent malignant di&s;order.</P>
<P>SICK rooms may at lea&s;t be purified and rendered much more comfortable to the pa|tient and &s;afe to the attendants by frequently deflagrating nitre on burning charcoal in different parts of the apartment: this is known
<PB N="12" REF="025366_0011_0FCD0DDA4E846A58">
to evolve con&s;iderable quantities of this vivi|fying air. Pouring vinegar upon a hot iron produces the &s;ame effect in an inferior de|gree, as it undergoes a partial decompo&s;ition, and a quantity of vital air, one of its con&s;titu|ent parts, is thereby &s;et at liberty. The contaminated air may be al&s;o removed by frequently kindling fires in the chimney of the chamber of the &s;ick; the air thus rarefi|ed in the chimney a&s;cends, being compre&s;&s;ed and followed by that in the chamber, and the place, which the contaminated air has left, is immediately occupied by a fre&s;h &s;up|ply of that which is pure.</P>
<P>WHITE-WASHING the walls of the cham|ber has been found by the late humane and benevolent Mr. Howard, highly conducive to the removal of infection, and is &s;trongly recommended by Dr. Blane.</P>
<P>ALL kinds of plants in a &s;tate of vegetation furni&s;h more or le&s;s pure air, at the &s;ame time that they ab&s;orb and correct that which is
<PB N="13" REF="025366_0012_0FCD0DDB804A3800">
contaminated. Ve&s;&s;els of fre&s;h water there|fore with cotton &s;teeped in them, and the &s;eed of pepper gra&s;s &s;own upon it, which will im|mediately vegetate, may with propriety be placed in different parts of the chamber, with this caution that they be removed during the night, and the water renewed every morn|ing.</P>
<P>MANY melancholy examples of a fever, with a complexion and features, nearly re|&s;embling the one under con&s;ideration occur|red during the late war, between United Ame|rica and Great-Britain, in the military ho&s;pi|tals and pri&s;on &s;hips.</P>
<P>THAT a contagious fever may be generat|ed in any &s;ituation where fre&s;h air is exclud|ed, and cleanline&s;s neglected, e&s;pecially in the winter &s;ea&s;on; and that the contagion or mia&s;mata &s;o generated, is rendered active by the &s;ummer's heat in &s;uch confined and filthy places, is now generally admitted by the mo&s;t accurate ob&s;ervers: The account given of
<PB N="14" REF="025366_0013_0FCD0DDDD179C910">
the periodical ri&s;e, progre&s;s and decline, of the plague at Aleppo by Dr. Ru&s;&s;el, renders this a matter of certainty. The mia&s;ma or contagion thus generated, is propagated and &s;pread by infection.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o generally admitted, that the con|tagion by which putrid fevers are produced, is not like that of many other di&s;ea&s;es perma|nent and con&s;tantly exi&s;ting, but in the cir|cum&s;tances ju&s;t related, it is occa&s;ionally gene|rated and propagated. At the &s;ame time it is a rational inference to &s;uppo&s;e, that all fe|vers ari&s;ing in &s;uch circum&s;tances are of the &s;ame &s;pecific nature, however they may dif|fer in the number and violence of their &s;ymp|toms, and that &s;uch difference may be im|puted to the circum&s;tances of climate, &s;ea&s;on, &s;oil and con&s;titution, concurring with the contagion and modifying its force.</P>
<P>How far the fever at pre&s;ent prevalent here may be combined with, or modified by the contagion of the influenza, which has al&s;o
<PB N="15" REF="025366_0014_0FCD0DDF2EA58358">
for &s;ome time pa&s;t, been very epidemic, is a que&s;tion that I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent enter into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A phy&s;ician under the &s;ignature of Quae&s;tor Veritatis, in the Federal Gazette of the 28th of August, a&s;&s;erts that the pre&s;ent malignant fever is only a modification of the influ|enza, and has attempted to &s;upport his opinion in the fol|lowing manner: "That the long continued heat and drought have relaxed, debilitated and di&s;po&s;ed the bodies of per&s;ons who lead indolent lives, are imployed in &s;edentary occupati|ons, or accu&s;tomed to intemperance, to fevers attended with &s;ymptoms of putrefaction mu&s;t be obvious to every per&s;on acquainted with the animal oeconomy, and that di&s;ea&s;es of the mo&s;t inflammatory nature will, in their progre&s;s, produce the mo&s;t unequivocal &s;ymptoms of putrefaction, or a gangre|nous tendency of the &s;olids under &s;uch circum&s;tances, is well known to every per&s;on conver&s;ant with the records of medicine.</P>
<P>It is under &s;uch circum&s;tances that the &s;mall pox and mea|zles become highly putrid and malignant, and it is in per&s;ons of this de&s;cription, that the &s;carlatina angino&s;a a&s;&s;umes the form and features of the cynanche maligna.</P>
<P>It is however &s;aid, that as a greater proportion of people have died in water-&s;treet, than in any other &s;treet of the ci|ty, there mu&s;t be &s;ome local &s;ource of &s;pecific contagion. But this may be explained more rationally from there being a le&s;s portion of pure air there than in any other parts of the city, owing to the &s;ituation of the hou&s;es on the we&s;t &s;ide, being half buried under ground, the number of &s;ailor taverns and huxter's &s;hops, which are receptacles of all kinds of filth, dirt and na&s;tine&s;s, and which from their &s;ituation are excluded from the benefit of free ventilation, &amp;c. Air de|prived of free circulation and frequently re&s;pired, is robbed of its vivifying principle, for want of which life can not be &s;upported, nor fires kindled."</P>
<P>If upon a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate enquiry, it &s;hall be found that tho&s;e affected with typhous and malignant &s;ymptoms, have com|municated the di&s;ea&s;e to tho&s;e re&s;iding in other parts of the city, who came to vi&s;it them, or being them&s;elves removed to other parts, communicated it to their attendants, who were not previou&s;ly affected with the typhous diathe&s;is, or had been previou&s;ly affected with the influenza or other di&s;|ea&s;e, the opinion of this anonimous writer will be completely &s;ubverted. But on the contrary, if it &s;hall appear, that tho&s;e circum&s;tanced as above mentioned, who have not had the influenza, have been attacked by it &s;oon after intercour&s;e with tho&s;e labouring under the &s;ymptoms of malignant fe|ver, it is a &s;trong pre&s;umption in favour of his opinion. This is a que&s;tion which can only be decided by a collection and accurate &s;tatement of facts, and till &s;uch collection and &s;tatement is made, every phy&s;ician who&s;e object is truth, will &s;u&s;pend his judgment.</P>
<P>From the &s;crutiny which has been made by different phy|&s;icians, and particularly by Dr. Hutchin&s;on, the phy&s;ician of the port, there has not been found evidence &s;ufficient to afford any &s;u&s;picion that the di&s;ea&s;e was imported by the French e|migrants from the we&s;t-indies, or generated on board any of their ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>And as there are no examples on record, &s;ince phy&s;icians became acquainted with the con&s;tituent parts and qualities of the atmo&s;phere, of putrid fevers being produced by the effluvia of vegetable &s;ub&s;tances putrifying in the open air, but by the effluvia of living animals under certain circum|&s;tances, I am &s;orry thus publicly to differ in opinion, on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, from &s;ome of my fellow practitioners, for who&s;e judgments and talents I entertain the highe&s;t venera|tion</P></NOTE></P>

which I hope will plead my apology for com|municating it at this early period.</P>
<P><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>In the treatment of this formidable di&s;ea&s;e, much &s;aga|city and caution are requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>The activity of the pul&s;e and heat of the &s;kin in its fir&s;t &s;tage, certainly call for the antiphlogi&s;tic regimen, and &s;uch medicines as abate arterial action. As a &s;tate of debility very &s;oon and con&s;tantly follows this &s;tate of increa&s;ed acti|on and apparent power in the arterial &s;y&s;tem, I have with others been deterred from employing blood letting. But have &s;ub&s;tituted purging, which dimini&s;hes arterial ten&s;ion in a flower and &s;afer manner. Some of my medical friends have informed me, that they have found calomel an&s;wer this purpo&s;e better than any other purgative.</P>
<P>Some patients in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e have found more relief from wearing a linen turban on their heads (previou&s;ly &s;haved) frequently wet with cold vinegar; and from affu&s;ions of cold water over their heads and &s;houlders, than from warm fomentations.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the activity of the pul&s;e, heat of the &s;kin, and praecordial anxiety are moderated, the cortex and elexir of vitriol are the mo&s;t certain remedies that can be employed, with the addition of wine, e&s;pecially claret, in &s;uch quanti|ties as to prevent the vital powers from &s;inking too much.</P>
<P>Should the vigour of the &s;y&s;tem, the anxiety and re&s;t|le&s;&s;ne&s;s &s;uddenly increa&s;e, immediate recour&s;e &s;hould be had to bli&s;ters, to the unlimitted u&s;e of &s;trong Madeira wine, volatile &s;alts, and every other cordial and exciting power that can be devi&s;ed, provided there be no haemorrhagy.</P></NOTE> The early exhibition of half a grain of tartar emetic every half hour, in barley water or camomile tea, till it operates either up|wards

or downwards, &s;ucceeded next day by a mild purgative occa&s;ionally repeated, a &s;udorific anodyne at night, with copi|ous dilution, for the purpo&s;e of promot|ing a free per&s;piration, generally affords &s;ome alleviation of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymp|toms. The patient, if his &s;tomach will ad|mit and retain it, may al&s;o take a &s;poonful

His bed to be in the middle of the floor, without curtains, all the windows, as well as the doors of the chamber to be kept open, and where practicable, he &s;hould be re|moved to the high lands in the country, upon the fir&s;t attack of the di&s;ea&s;e. Perhaps lying in a tent placed in a dry verdant field would be preferable to the mo&s;t &s;pacious chamber.</P>

the abatement in the action of the carotid and temporal arteries, the patient may take every night at bed time, half a grain of tartar eme|tic, mixed in a peppermint or cinnamon draught, with 25 drops of laudanum, and 2 drachms or 3 of acetated ammonia, increa&s;|ing or dimini&s;hing the proportion of the lau|danum, according to circum&s;tances. This compo&s;ition has generally the mo&s;t plea&s;ing effect in procuring re&s;t, and promoting per&s;|piration, particularly when the impetus of the blood in the ve&s;&s;els of the head is mode|rate.</P>

<P>WINE and volatiles, as well as large do&s;es of opium, given at the commencement of the di&s;ea&s;e, have proved highly injurious, and ap|pear, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to have occa&s;ioned, or at lea&s;t to have increa&s;ed the profu&s;e haemor|rhages from the no&s;e.

<P>WINE and volatiles under &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces, appear to render the action of the &s;y&s;tem di&s;proportioned to its &s;tate of power, for there mu&s;t be a certain degree of &s;trength, to bear the action excited by &s;timulating and cordial me|dicines, and regimen: For nothing is more pernicious, or even fatal, than that any part or function &s;hould be forced to make exertions

<P>In the latter &s;tage of this fever, at which time the mo&s;t common &s;ymptoms are great weakne&s;s, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, anxiety and impaired &s;en&s;ibility, nothing &s;eemed to retard the fatal event &s;o effectually, as a volatile aromatic ju|lep, with the addition of laudanum and the e&s;|&s;ence of peppermint and the moderate u&s;e of claret or port wine.</P>
<P>EVERY ca&s;e where the &s;kin became yel|low, and the countenance appeared cadave|rous, has hitherto proved mortal.</P>
<P>I not this the &s;ame as the &s;ynochus of Dr. Cullen? The treatment which has &s;uc|ceeded be&s;t &s;eems to indicate that it is.</P>
<P>WHEN treating of the &s;ynochus, Dr. Cul|len expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the following terms:
<PB N="24" REF="025366_0023_0FCD0DF40A093E90">
"In the &s;ynochus a <HI>violent</HI> reaction and phlogi&s;tic diathe&s;is appear, and prevail dur|ing &s;ome part of the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e; while at the &s;ame time, the&s;e circum&s;tances do not con&s;titute the principal part of the di&s;|ea&s;e, nor are to be expected to continue dur|ing the whole cour&s;e of it; and it is well known, that, in many ca&s;es, the &s;tate of vi|olent reaction is to be &s;ucceeded &s;ooner or later, by a &s;tate of debility, from the exce&s;s of which the danger of the di&s;ea&s;e is chiefly to ari&s;e. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary, that in ma|ny ca&s;es blood letting is to be avoided; and even although during the inflammatory &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, it may be proper, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to take care that the evacuation be not &s;o large as to increa&s;e the &s;tate of debility which is to follow."</P>
<P>THE fever however which I have been de|&s;cribing, differs from the &s;ynochus of Doctor Cullen, in the time of its duration, as well as in the violence of its &s;ymptoms. "It is rare," &s;ays that great reformer of medicine, "in this

<P>SINCE the above was written, I have taken particular pains to inve&s;tigate the ori|gin of the fever, de&s;cribed in the prece|ding pages, and have di&s;covered that the fir&s;t ca&s;e of it occurred at Richard Den|nie's, who kept a lodging-hou&s;e in Water-&s;treet, nearly oppo&s;ite to Dr. Hodge's. A man and his wife of the name of Parkin&s;on, pa&s;&s;engers in the brig Ann and Mary, from Dublin, took lodgings there the latter end of
<PB N="26" REF="025366_0025_0FCD0DF72D991C68">
June. They had one Engli&s;hman lodging with them at that time. Two young French|men afterwards took lodgings in the &s;ame hou&s;e. The re&s;t of the family con&s;i&s;ted of Richard Parkin&s;on, his wife and two daugh|ters. On the 3d. of Augu&s;t Dr. Cathrall vi&s;ited Mrs. Parkin&s;on, labouring under a highly malignant fever, as will appear by the annexed letter.</P>
<P>ON the 4th of the &s;ame month, Dr. Phy|&s;ick, at the reque&s;t of the over&s;eers, vi&s;ited the Engli&s;hman, who died &s;uddenly the &s;ame night. The next day he opened the body, but could di&s;cover nothing except &s;ome de|rangement in the colon and ve&s;&s;ica fellis, that could lead to a di&s;covery of the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e or the cau&s;e of his death. On open|ing his head, he found the ve&s;&s;els of the brain uncommonly di&s;tended, and turgid with blood.</P>
<P>MRS. PARKINSON died on the 7th of Augu&s;t. One of the French lads was taken
<PB N="27" REF="025366_0026_0FCD0DFB593E7E70">
ill &s;oon after Mrs. Parkin&s;on&mdash;was attended by a French phy&s;ician who lodged at Mrs. Sage's in Front-&s;treet: but I was not able to a&s;certain the day of his death.</P>
<P>SOON after the death of the French lad, Mr. Dennie was attacked by the fever, and his wife two days after. They were both buried the &s;ame day&mdash;He &s;urvived the attack &s;even, and &s;he only five days.</P>
<P>MRS. PARKINSON's hu&s;band, and Mr. Dennie's two daughters e&s;caped the infection, but the other French lad who took fre&s;h lodg|ings higher up Water-&s;treet, died a few days after.</P>
<P>ONE of the young women from whom I received the mo&s;t circum&s;tantial part of the above account, now re&s;ides at Dr. Hodge's who has humanely afforded her and her &s;i&s;|ter an a&s;ylum in their di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="025366_0027_0FCD0DFD5D13AE08">
THE mo&s;t material parts of the above cir|cum&s;tances have al&s;o been confirmed by the Rev. Mr. Keating.</P>
<P>TWO of the family next door to the lodg|ing-hou&s;e, died &s;oon after of the &s;ame com|plaint. Dr. Hodge's maid-&s;ervant, a young woman from the country, and his little daughter, have al&s;o died &s;ince of the &s;ame complaint; and a number of others in the &s;ame neighbourhood.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o &s;aid, but for this I cannot vouch, that a carpenter in Ken&s;ington, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in breaking open the &s;heathing of the cabin of Mr. Steinmetz's brig, which had 117 French We&s;t-Indians on board, was &s;oon after at|tacked with feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms; of which he died in a few days; and that &s;everal Dani&s;h &s;ailors have been affected by the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e at Ken&s;ington.</P>

<P>IT appears from authentic documents, that the &s;ame kind of fever as the one which I have de&s;cribed in the preceding pages, has been prevalent in Philadelphia at two differ|ent periods. The fir&s;t, A. D. 1740; &s;up|po&s;ed to have been introduced by means of a quantity of wearing apparel brought in a trunk from Barbadoes, belonging to a gentleman who died of it in that I&s;land.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd time of its appearance was A. D. 1762, introduced by a mariner, who arrived &s;ick with it from the Havanna, and communicated it to the family where he lodged; from whence it &s;pread rapidly from
<PB N="32" REF="025366_0031_0FCD0E078EC09898">
hou&s;e to hou&s;e as families had intercour&s;e with one another.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the notes of Dr. Redman, the worthy Pre&s;ident of the Philadelphia College of Phy&s;icians (who has favoured me with the privilege of making u&s;e of them) it made its appearance the latter end of Augu&s;t of the year la&s;t mentioned. About the 20th or 25th of September, its progre&s;s &s;eems to have arrived to its height. From the 27th it gradually declined, &s;o that by the 10th of October, in&s;tead of 18 or 20 patients of a day, which Dr. Redman had before attended in it, he had now only two or three.</P>
<P>THE fever at that period was circum&s;cri|bed between Pine-&s;treet, northerly, and three or four &s;quares from thence &s;outherly, and extended from Water-&s;treet, to Third or Fourth-&s;treet we&s;terly. Its fir&s;t and greate&s;t ravages were about the New Market, which lay near the &s;ource of the contagion. The fever as it appeared at that time, is thus de|&s;cribed
<PB N="33" REF="025366_0032_0FCD0E08C41929F0">
by Dr. Redman in a communication ju&s;t pre&s;ented to, and read in the College of Phy&s;icians.</P>
<Q><P>THE patients were generally &s;eized with a &s;udden and &s;evere pain in the head and eye-balls, which frequently appeared a little inflamed, or had a reddi&s;h ca&s;t, great pain in the back and limbs, and much dejection of &s;pirits. A &s;ick &s;tomach generally attended, but in various degrees of violence, with fre|quent vomiting, more or le&s;s of green or yel|lowbile, and was di&s;tingui&s;hed from the cholera morbus by not having a purging with it. There was al&s;o a kind of cardialgia, or burn|ing heat about the &s;crobiculus cordis, with great oppre&s;&s;ion; but if I remember right, not much pain like a colic; nor do I recol|lect any chill <HI>generally</HI> preceding the above &s;ymptoms&mdash;however, it might be with &s;ome. The &s;kin was dry with a di&s;agreeable burning heat in it, &s;en&s;ible to the hand of others. The tongue was not very dry at fir&s;t, but rather
<PB N="34" REF="025366_0033_0FCD0E0D751C7B38">
moi&s;t, and covered with whiti&s;h mucus. The pul&s;e was not generally either full or ten&s;e, but very quick in the beginning, by which the degree of fever was chiefly de&s;igna|ted. Yet in &s;ome per&s;ons previou&s;ly very ple|thoric from high living and other circum&s;tances, &s;ome fullne&s;s without ten&s;ion was ob&s;erved in the pul&s;e in the fir&s;t &s;tage; after which in many, the pul&s;e became &s;o moderate in every re&s;pect, as to be &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable from that of a per&s;on in health. Though very re&s;tle&s;s and often to&s;&s;ing about, or changing po&s;ition from oppre&s;&s;ion at the praecordia, I think they were but &s;eldom very delirious; but if the di&s;ea&s;e continued to increa&s;e, and re&s;i&s;t the power of medicines, they rather grew comato&s;e, which was a bad &s;ymptom, and generally continued till death, unle&s;s, the black vomiting came on and occa&s;ionally rou&s;ed them. But even tho&s;e who were comato&s;e, when rou&s;ed appeared quite &s;en&s;ible, though not capable of pre&s;erving a regular connection of ideas on any one &s;ubject for any length of time. They
<PB N="35" REF="025366_0034_0FCD0E0E688569C0">
&s;oon became yellow in their eyes and &s;kin univer&s;ally, which became extreme in &s;ome before, and in almo&s;t all after death: and in tho&s;e that recovered, it continued during the whole convale&s;cent &s;tate, and in &s;ome, a great part of the cuticle peeled off.</P></Q>
<P>"WHEN the di&s;ea&s;e terminated fatally, it was generally on the 4th, 5th or 6th day; &s;ome few later; but after the 7th day, or even &s;ooner if the pul&s;e became much calmer and &s;lower without a <HI>coma,</HI> and the patient inclin|ed to a natural ea&s;y &s;leep, though &s;hort, with a moi&s;t &s;kin and tongue, &amp;c. we were en|couraged to hope, and promi&s;e much, and generally &s;ucceeded in our progno&s;tica|tions," &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE method of treatment adopted by the mo&s;t &s;agacious phy&s;icians at that time in the city, was nearly &s;imilar to that recommend|ed in the text of the preceding pages; except
<PB N="36" REF="025366_0035_0FCD0E11A545BF80">
that they were more re&s;erved in the u&s;e of emetics, but more liberal in that of &s;aline ca|thartics. They never employed bli&s;ters ex|cept when the patients were affected with coma, and then &s;eldom with much benefit.</P>
