<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE right education of youth, being a point of great im|portance to the pre&s;ent and &s;ucceeding generations, it is to be regretted, that the want of proper books for the u&s;e of &s;chools, &s;hould have been &s;o general a &s;ubject of complaint; and that very few attempts have been made to &s;upply this deficiency, by introducing &s;omething on &s;uch a plan, as might, be&s;ides improving the under&s;tandings and morals, in&s;tructively amu&s;e the vacant hours of young people, and have a tendency to ren|der the ta&s;k of teaching a more agreeable employment.</P>
<P>WITH a view to the&s;e objects, the following Mi&s;cellaneous Compilation is now offered to the public. Mo&s;t of the extracts which compo&s;e it, were collected &s;ome years ago, from a va|riety of authors, by a per&s;on who had no other intention, at the time, but that of pre&s;erving them for her own peru&s;al and amu&s;ement; and who, from motives wholly di&s;intere&s;ted, has lately, at the reque&s;t of her friends, con&s;ented to their publica|tion, with a hope, that if they are favourably received, it may prove an incitement to &s;ome per&s;on of greater abilities, to pur|&s;ue this or a better plan, whereby our &s;chools may be furni&s;hed with a book more de&s;erving their acceptance.</P>
<P>IT gives &s;ome concern to the compiler, that &s;he neglected to di&s;tingui&s;h the different parts, with the names of their authors, at the time they were &s;elected, as it is not now in her power to &s;upply the omi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="020526_0003_0FAFE0BF78F4B428">THE editor has thought it nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that a few verbal alterations have been made in &s;ome of the extracts, the better to adapt them to the u&s;e of the pre&s;ent de&s;ign; but as the &s;entiments and tenor of the original pieces are not thereby materially changed, it is hoped this freedom will be excu&s;ed by their re&s;pective authors, to whom not the lea&s;t injury or of|fence has been intended.</P>

<L>This day thy fav'ring hand be nigh,</L>

<L>Still may it lead, protect, &s;upply,</L>

<L>If bli&s;s thy Providence impart,</L>
<L>For which re&s;ign'd I pray,</L>

<L>Affliction, &s;hould thy love intend,</L>

<P>THE duties of religion, &s;incerely and regularly performed, will always be &s;ufficient to exalt the meane&s;t, and to exerci&s;e the highe&s;t under&s;tanding. That mind will never be vacant, which is frequently recalled by &s;tated duties to meditations on eter|nal intere&s;ts; nor can any hour be long, which is &s;pent in obtaining &s;ome new qualification for cele&s;tial happine&s;s.</P>
<P>TO love an enemy, is the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of a religion, which is not of man but of God. It could be de|livered as a precept, only by him who lived and died to e&s;ta|bli&s;h it by his example.</P>
<P>IF thou do&s;t good to man, as an evidence of thy love to God, thy virtue will be exalted from moral to divine; and that hap|pine&s;s, which is the foreta&s;te of paradi&s;e, will be thy reward upon earth.</P>
<P>RECREATION after bu&s;ine&s;s is allowable; but he that follows his plea&s;ure in&s;tead of his bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hall in a little time have no bu&s;ine&s;s to follow.</P>

<P><Q>BLESSED are the poor in &s;pirit, for their's is the king|dom of Heaven.</Q>
&mdash;Thus our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour opened his &s;er|mon on the mount; and from his example we may be a&s;&s;ured, that humility is the riche&s;t garment that the &s;oul can wear. By this word is to be under&s;tood, not an abject poorne&s;s of &s;pirit, that would &s;toop to do a mean thing; but &s;uch an humble &s;en&s;e of human nature, as &s;ets the heart and affections right towards God, and gives us every temper that is tender and affectionate towards our fellow creatures. This is the &s;oil of all virtues, where every thing that is good and lovely grows.</P>
<P>DESPISE not labour; if you do not want it for food, you may for phy&s;ic: It &s;trengthens the body, invigorates the mind, and prevents the ill con&s;equences of idlene&s;s.</P>

<P>PRIDE hides a man's faults from him&s;elf, and magnifies them to others.</P>
<P><Q>THERE is nothing (&s;ays Plato) &s;o delightful, as the hear|ing or the &s;peaking of truth.</Q>
For this rea&s;on, there is no con|ver&s;ation &s;o agreeable, as that of the man of integrity, who hears without any intention to betray, and &s;peaks without any intention to deceive.</P>
<P>Truth is always con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and needs nothing to help it out; it is always near at hand, and fits upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware: Whereas a lie is trouble&s;ome, and &s;ets a man's invention on the rack, and one trick needs a great many more of the &s;ame kind to make it good.</P>
<P>MORAL virtues them&s;elves, without religion, are but cold, lifele&s;s and in&s;ipid: It is religion only which opens the mind to great conceptions, fills it with the mo&s;t &s;ublime ideas, and warms the &s;oul more than &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>BY reading we enjoy the dead, by conver&s;ation, the living, and by contemplation, our&s;elves. Reading enriches the me|mory, conver&s;ation poli&s;hes the wit, and contemplation im|proves the judgment.</P>
<P>THE commands of Heaven (in the ob&s;ervance of which re|ligion principally con&s;i&s;ts) are very plain and obvious to the meane&s;t under&s;tanding, and are nothing el&s;e but exhortations to love and directions for &s;ocial happine&s;s.</P>

<P>A WISE Heathen, with great ju&s;tice, compares pro&s;perity to the indulgence of a fond mother to her child, which often proves his ruin; but the affection of the Divine Being to that of a wi&s;e father, who would have his &s;ons exerci&s;ed with labour, di&s;appointment and pains, that they may gather &s;trength and improve their fortitude. Sometimes too, a misfortune may happen to a good man, to pre&s;erve him from a much greater one. Thus &s;ickne&s;s may be a very great mercy to him, if it keeps him from embarking in a ve&s;&s;el which will be lo&s;t in its pa&s;&s;age. Thus poverty may &s;creen him from a great many evils which would be brought upon him by riches, and the like. We are &s;o &s;hort-&s;ighted, that we know not how to di&s;|tingui&s;h, and often take the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings for misfortunes, and the heavie&s;t cur&s;es for ble&s;&s;ings.

<P>THE duties that are owing to friends, are integrity, love, coun&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It is not intimacy, and frequency of conver&s;ation, that makes a friend, but a di&s;intere&s;ted ob&s;ervance of the&s;e duties.</P>

It is not like the practice of many other virtues, dif|ficult and painful, but attended with &s;o much plea&s;ure, that were there no po&s;itive command which enjoined it, nor any re|compence laid up for it hereafter, a generous mind would in|dulge in it for the natural gratification that accompanies it.

<P>MEEKNESS may be called the pioneer of all the other virtues, which levels every ob&s;truction, and &s;mooths every dif|ficulty, that might impede their entrance, or retard their pro|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>IF it were only for mere human rea&s;ons, it would turn to a better account, to be patient; nothing defeats the malice of an enemy, like a &s;pirit of forbearance; the return of rage for rage cannot be &s;o effectually provoking. True gentlene&s;s, like an impenetrable armour, repels the mo&s;t pointed &s;hafts of malice; they cannot pierce thro' this invulnerable &s;hield, but either fall hurtle&s;s to the ground, or return to wound the hand that &s;hot them</P>
<P>A MEEK &s;pirit will not look out of it&s;elf for happine&s;s, becau&s;e it finds a con&s;tant banquet at home; yet by a &s;ort of Di|vine Alchymy, it will convert all external events to its own profit, and be able to deduce &s;ome good, even from the mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing; it will extract comfort and &s;atisfaction from the mo&s;t barren circum&s;tances; "it will &s;uck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock."</P>
<P>HONOURS and dignities are tran&s;ient, beauty and riches frail and fleeting, to a proverb. Would not the truly

wi&s;e, therefore, wi&s;h to have &s;ome one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which they might call their own in the &s;evere&s;t exigencies? But this wi&s;h can only be accompli&s;hed, by acquiring, and maintaining, that calm and ab&s;olute &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which as the world had no hand in giving, &s;o it cannot, by the mo&s;t malicious exerti|on of its power, take away.</P>
<P>AN amiable and wi&s;e woman will, always have &s;omething better to value her&s;elf on than outward advantages, which, however captivating, are &s;till but &s;ubordinate parts of a truly excellent character.</P>
<P>HOW cruel is it to exti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">i&s;h, by neglect or unkindne&s;s, the precious &s;en&s;ibility of an open temper, to chill the amiable glow of an ingenious &s;oul, and to quench the bright flame of a noble and generous &s;pirit! The&s;e are of higher worth, than all the documents of learning; of dearer price, than all the ad|vantages which can be derived from the mo&s;t refined and artifi|cial mode of education.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t of men, and the be&s;t of books, can do us good, only &s;o far as they turn us from them&s;elves, and every human comfort, to &s;eek and receive every kind of good, from God alone.</P>
<P>TO de&s;ire to communicate good to every creature, in the degree we can, and it is capable of receiving from us, is a di|vine temper; for thus God &s;tands unchangeably di&s;po&s;ed to|wards the whole creation.</P>

<HEAD>ACCEPTABLE SACRIFICE.</HEAD>
<P>HE that keepeth the law, bringeth offerings enough: He that taketh heed to the commandment, offereth a peace-offering: He that requiteth a good turn offereth fine flour: And he that giveth alms, &s;acrificeth prai&s;e. To depart from wickedne&s;s, is a thing plea&s;ing to the Lord; and to for&s;ake unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, is a propitiation.

<P>WE &s;ee almo&s;t every day, the unexpected death of our friends and our enemies; we &s;ee new graves often opened for men older and younger than our&s;elves; for the cautious and the carele&s;s, the di&s;&s;olute and the temperate; for men, who like us, were providing to enjoy or improve hours now irrever&s;ibly cut off; we &s;ee all this, and yet, in&s;tead of living, let year glide after year, in preparations to live.</P>

<P>HE that looks upon the bu&s;ine&s;s and bu&s;tle of the world, with the philo&s;ophy with which Socrates &s;urveyed the fair at Athens, will turn away at la&s;t with his exclamation, "how many things are here which I do not want."</P>
<P>WHILE affliction prepares us for felicity, we may con|&s;ole our&s;elves under its pre&s;&s;ures, by remembering, that they are no particular marks of divine di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;ince all the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of per&s;ecution have been &s;uffered by tho&s;e, "of whom the world was not worthy;" and the Redeemer of mankind him&s;elf was "a man of &s;orrows, and acquainted with grief."</P>

<P>TO forbear replying to an unju&s;t reproach, and overlook it, with a generous, or (if po&s;&s;ible) with an entire neglect of it, is one of the mo&s;t heroic acts of a great mind.</P>

<P>AMONG the antient Romans, it was not the hou&s;e which honoured the ma&s;ter, but the ma&s;ter the hou&s;e. A cottage with them became as augu&s;t as a temple, when ju&s;tice, gene|ro&s;ity, probity, &s;incerity, and honour, were lodged in it; and how can a hou&s;e be called &s;mall, which contains &s;o many and &s;uch great virtues?</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="020526_0153_0FAFE55D8162CC20">AN extraordinary merit may lie hid under a mean habit, as a rich garment may cover enormous vices.</P>
<P>THE nobility ari&s;ing from birth, is by far inferior to that which proceeds from merit.</P>
<P>MARCUS Aurelius was aver&s;e to every thing that had the air of pomp and luxury. He lay upon the bare ground; at twelve years old he took the habit of a Philo&s;opher; he forbore the u&s;e of guards, the imperial ornaments, and the en|&s;igns of honour, which were carried before the Cae&s;ars and the Augu&s;ti. Nor was this conduct owing to his ignorance of what was grand and beautiful, but to the ju&s;ter and purer ta&s;te he had of both, and to an intimate per&s;ua&s;ion, that the greate&s;t glory, and principal duty of man, e&s;pecially if in power, and eminently con&s;picuous, is &s;o far to imitate the Deity, as to throw him&s;elf into a condition of wanting as little as may be for him&s;elf, and doing all the good to others he is capable of.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hews a greatne&s;s of &s;oul to overlook our own nobility, and not &s;uffer it to gain the a&s;cendant over our actions, we may likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that it is no le&s;s great in &s;uch as have rai&s;ed them&s;elves by merit, not to forget the meanne&s;s of their extraction, nor be a&s;hamed of it.</P>
<P>WE read in the &s;criptures, that Boaz, in the mid&s;t of riches, was laborious, diligent in hu&s;bandry, plain without luxury, delicacy, &s;loth or pride. How affable, how obliging and kind to his &s;ervants! "The Lord be with you," &s;ays he to his reapers; and they an&s;wered him, "the Lord ble&s;s thee." This was the beautiful language of religious antiquity; but how little known in our days.</P>
<P>How commendable was his behaviour towards Ruth, when he de&s;ires her not to go into any other field to glean, but to abide fa&s;t by his maidens, to eat and drink with them, and the charitable order he gives his reapers to let her glean even among the &s;heaves, and to let fall &s;ome of the handfuls on purpo&s;e for her that &s;he might gather them up without being a&s;hamed; teaching us by this wi&s;e conduct, to &s;ave tho&s;e we oblige, the confu&s;ion of receiving, and our&s;elves the tempta|tion of vain-glory in giving.</P>

<P>IF we are firmly re&s;olved to live up to the dictates of rea|&s;on, without any regard to wealth, reputation, or the like con|&s;iderations, any more than as they fall in with our principal de&s;ign, we may go through life with &s;teadine&s;s and plea&s;ure; but if we act by &s;everal broken views, and will not only be virtuous, but wealthy, popular, and every thing that has a value &s;et upon it by the world, we &s;hall live and die in mi&s;ery and repentance.</P>

di&s;appointments. A man &s;hould direct all his &s;tudies and en|deavours, at making him&s;elf ea&s;y now, and happy hereafter.</P>
<P>IT is of the la&s;t importance to &s;ea&s;on the pa&s;&s;ions of a child with devotion, which &s;eldom dies in a mind that has received an early tincture of it.

The fire may be covered and overlaid, but cannot be entirely quenched and &s;mothered.</P>
<P>PURE devotion opens the mind to great conceptions, and fills it with more &s;ublime ideas, than any that are to be met with in the mo&s;t exalted &s;cience; and at the &s;ame time warms and agitates the &s;oul more than &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure.</P>

<P>SOCRATES, on the day of his execution, a little be|fore the draught of poi&s;on was brought to him, entertaining his friends with a di&s;cour&s;e on the immortality of the &s;oul, has the&s;e words: "Whether or no God will approve of my actions, I know not; but this I am &s;ure of, that I have at all times made it my endeavour to plea&s;e him; and I have a good hope, that this my endeavour will be accepted by him."</P>

<P>SINCERITY is firm and &s;ub&s;tantial, and there is no|thing hollow or un&s;ound in it; and becau&s;e it is plain and open, fears no di&s;covery; of which the crafty man is always in dan|ger.</P>
<P>PLUTARCH has written an e&s;&s;ay on the benefits which a man may receive from his enemies; and mentions this in particular, "that, by the reproaches ca&s;t upon us we &s;ee the wor&s;t &s;ide of our&s;elves, and open our eyes to &s;everal blemi&s;hes and defects in our lives and conver&s;ations, which we &s;hould not have ob&s;erved without the help of &s;uch ill-natured monitors."</P>
<P>LET us "keep the heart with all diligence, &s;eeing out of it are the i&s;&s;ues of life." Let us account our mind the mo&s;t im|portant province which is committed to our care; and as we cannot rule events, &s;tudy at lea&s;t to rule our&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT is too common with the young, even when they re&s;olve to tread the path of virtue and honour, to &s;et out with pre&s;ump|tuous confidence in them&s;elves. Tru&s;ting to their own abilities, for carrying them &s;ucce&s;sfully through life, they are carele&s;s of applying to God, or of deriving any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from what they are apt to reckon the gloomy di&s;cipline of religion. Alas! how little do they know the dangers which await them?"</P>
<P>Neither human wi&s;dom, nor human virtue, un&s;upport|ed by religion, are equal for the trying &s;ituations which
<PB N="175" REF="020526_0174_0FAFE571069D7370">
often occur in life. By the &s;hock of temptation, how fre|quently have the mo&s;t virtuous intentions been overthrown! Under the pre&s;&s;ure of di&s;a&s;ter, how often has the greate&s;t con|&s;tancy &s;unk! De&s;titute of the favour of God, you are in no bet|ter &s;ituation, with all your boa&s;ted abilities, than orphans left to wander in a trackle&s;s de&s;art, without any guide to conduct them, or any &s;helter to cover them from the gathering &s;torm. Correct, then, this ill-founded arrogance. Expect not that your happine&s;s can be independent of him who made you. By faith and repentance, apply to the Redeemer of the world. By piety and prayer, &s;eek the protection of the God of Hea|ven.</P>
<P>THE cheerfulne&s;s of a well-regulated mind, &s;prings from a good con&s;cience, and the favour of Heaven, and is bounded by temperance and rea&s;on. It makes a man happy in him&s;elf, and promotes the happine&s;s of all around him. It is the clear and calm &s;un&s;hine of a mind illuminated by piety and virtue. It crowns all other good di&s;po&s;itions, and comprehends the ge|neral effect which they ought to produce on the heart.</P>
<P>LET no man ra&s;hly determine, that his unwillingne&s;s to be plea&s;ed, is a proof of under&s;tanding, unle&s;s his &s;uperiority appears from a le&s;s doubtful evidence; for though peevi&s;hne&s;s may &s;ometimes boa&s;t its de&s;cent from learning or from wit, it is much oftener of ba&s;e extraction, the child of vanity and nur&s;ling of ignorance.</P>
<P>LET the virtuous remember, amid&s;t all their &s;ufferings, that though the heart of the good man may bleed, even to death, he will never feel a torment equal to the rendings of remor&s;e.</P>
<P>PLATO being told, that he had many enemies who &s;poke ill of him, "It is no matter, &s;aid he, I will live &s;o that none &s;hall believe them." Hearing, at another time, that an inti|mate friend of his had &s;poken detractingly of him, "I am &s;ure he would not do it, &s;ays he, if he had not &s;ome rea&s;on for it." This is the &s;ure&s;t, as well as the noble&s;t way, of drawing the &s;ting out of a reproach, and the true method of preparing a
<PB N="176" REF="020526_0175_0FAFE571C8E16060">
man for that great and only relief again&s;t the pains of calumny, a good con&s;cience.</P>
<P>JUDGE not of mankind in general from the conduct of a few individuals. There are per&s;ons capable of alleviating all our cares by a friendly participation, and of heightening every &s;atisfaction by &s;haring them. Cultivate an acquaintance with the truly de&s;erving, and the painful remembrance of in|gratitude will &s;oon be lo&s;t in the reciprocal endearments of &s;in|cere friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>DOST thou a&s;k a torch to di&s;cover the brightne&s;s of the morning? Do&s;t thou appeal to argument for proofs of divine perfection? Look down to the earth on which thou &s;tande&s;t, and lift up thine eye to the worlds that roll above thee: Thou be|holde&s;t &s;plendour, abundance and beauty; is not he who pro|duced them mighty? Thou con&s;idere&s;t&mdash;is not he who formed thy under&s;tanding, wi&s;e? Thou enjoye&s;t&mdash;is not he who gra|tifies thy &s;en&s;es, good? Can aught have limited his bounty, but his wi&s;dom? or can any defects be therein di&s;covered by thy &s;agacity?</P>
<P>RELIGION pre&s;cribes to every mi&s;erable man, the means of bettering his condition; it &s;hews him, that the bear|ing of his afflictions as he ought to do, will naturally end in the removal of them; it makes him ea&s;y here, becau&s;e it can make him happy hereafter.</P>
<P>A CONTENTED mind is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing a man can enjoy in this world; and if in the pre&s;ent life his happi|ne&s;s ari&s;es from the &s;ubduing of his de&s;ires, it will ari&s;e in the next from the gratification of them.</P>
<P>EVERY wi&s;e man will con&s;ider this life only as it may conduce to the happine&s;s of the other, and cheerfully &s;acrifice the plea&s;ures of a few years to tho&s;e of an eternity.</P>
<P>HOWEVER far &s;ome men may have gone in the &s;cience of impartiality, perhaps there is not one of them but would be &s;urprized, if he could be &s;hewn how much farther he might go.</P>

Their temptations are proportioned to their abundance; their cares are more and their di&s;tractions greater; &s;o that you have no rea&s;on to envy them, nor repine at your own condition; and the&s;e are chiefly your temptations, and again&s;t the&s;e you mu&s;t be more particularly watchful. Cer|tainly, if you con&s;ider things aright, you will find that your &s;tore-hou&s;e is the mo&s;t &s;ure, your &s;upply mo&s;t certain; for you are immediately in the hands of God, of him who feedeth the ravens, and cloatheth the gra&s;s of the field; &s;o that you may be much more a&s;&s;ured that he will cloathe you. Endeavour to be humble, holy, Heavenly minded; always remembering, that he is the poore&s;t man, who is poor in grace.

<P>There are many, who, by arithmetic, learn to divide every thing into the mo&s;t minute fractions, and yet do not know how to divide an halfpenny with a poor afflicted brother in the way of charity.</P>
