<BIBL>PSALM cxxix. 1, 2.</BIBL>
<Q><L><HI>Many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth, may</HI> I&s;rael <HI>now &s;ay:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth; yet they have not prevailed again&s;t me.</HI></L></Q>

<P>A <HI>Century</HI> from the <HI>Incorporation</HI> of the <HI>Town, this Day</HI> expires&mdash;And altho' it was long a Frontier, and has often &s;uffer'd the Fury of the Enemy; is yet fair, and flouri&s;h|ing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> of GOD has been his peculiar Care in all Ages of the World&mdash;And therefore altho' the Seed of the Serpent have often per&s;ecuted the Seed of the Woman; yet they have never been able fully to accompli&s;h their De&s;ires&mdash;The Adver&s;ary hath often lifted up the Horn,
<PB N="2" REF="007020_0005_102AE9A38DFAF6D8">
and they that hate <HI>Mount-Sion</HI> have often bro't her low; yet they have been no more than a Scourge in the Hand of GOD, to cha&s;ti&s;e his People, to correct what was ami&s;s, and to make them more humble and &s;ervent in his Ser|vice: Yet the Enemy meant not &s;o.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> in <HI>this World</HI> is in a <HI>militant</HI> State, and may well expect &s;hocking A&s;&s;aults from tho&s;e that hate her.&mdash;She hath been troubled on every Side, and perplexed, but not in De&s;pair; per&s;ecuted, but not for&s;aken; ca&s;t down, but not de&s;troyed; a Bu&s;h burning, but not con&s;umed.</P>
<P>It was frequently thus with <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> while they continu'd the peculiar People of God&mdash;Many a Time have they af|flicted me from my Youth up, may <HI>I&s;rael</HI> now &s;ay, many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth; yet they have not prevailed again&s;t me.</P>
<P>Interpreters agree that this P&s;alm was written, when &s;ome new and heavy Calamity either pre&s;&s;ed hard upon, or impended that People.&mdash;But whether when <HI>Senacherib,</HI> with the Ho&s;t of <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> invaded <HI>Judea;</HI> or when <HI>Sanbal|lat,</HI> and Confederates, after the Return of the Captivity, made Intere&s;t again&s;t them in the Court of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> or at &s;ome other calamitous Sea&s;on; is neither ea&s;y, nor im|portant to determine.</P>
<P>For whatever was the particular Occa&s;ion of the Writ|ing; the De&s;ign is manife&s;tly to excite that People to a &s;erious Recollection of the numerous Calamities bro't upon them by their Enemies, ever &s;ince their being taken into Covenant with, and made the peculiar People of God&mdash;As al&s;o to acknowledge the merciful Interpo&s;itions of God for them; who notwith&s;tanding their frequent Rebellions again&s;t him, had not &s;uffered their Enemies &s;o far to pre|vail, as to cut them off from being a People.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="007020_0006_102AE9A59E2E2E58">
<HI>Yet they have not prevailed again&s;t me,</HI> is not to be under|&s;tood in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e, as if they had never been over|come, or bro't into Subjection by their Enemies&mdash;for in this Sen&s;e it is not true, as appears from the Scripture-Hi&s;tory of that Church and People.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Meaning therefore is, they have never been able wholly to extirpate us, or to cut us off from being a Church and Nation.&mdash;</P>
<P>Our Text is well paraphras'd by a learned Prelate.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bp. <HI>Patrick</HI> in loc.</NOTE></P>

<P>From the Words let us con&s;ider,</P>
<P>I. The <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of GOD, as frequently afflicted by their Enemies, and yet pre&s;erv'd from utter Ruin:</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P>II. As a&s;cribing the Glory of their Pre&s;ervation unto GOD.</P>
<P>I. Then let us con&s;ider the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of GOD, as frequently afflicted by their Enemies, and yet pre&s;erved from utter Ruin.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of their Affliction and Pre&s;ervation, from their &s;ojourning in <HI>Egypt,</HI> to the Reign of <HI>Aba&s;uerus</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> you have on &s;acred Record, and is therefore un|nece&s;&s;ary to be recited here.&mdash;</P>

<P>As the Church was purchas'd by his own Blood, the FATHER hath in all Ages committed the Pre&s;ervation of it to HIM; and as <HI>Mediator</HI> ve&s;ted him with all Power in Heaven and Earth. In all the Afflictions of his Peo|ple, he was afflicted, in his Love and in his Pity he re|deemed them, he bare them, and carried them all the Days of old.&mdash;He was the Refuge of <HI>our</HI> Fathers in their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es.&mdash;Let us therefore mention the loving Kindne&s;&s;es of the LORD, and the Prai&s;es of the LORD, according to all that he hath be&s;towed upon us&mdash;And the great Goodne&s;s towards the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> which he hath be&s;towed according to his Mercy, and according to the Multitude of his loving Kindne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Let the Con&s;ideration of the&s;e Things animate us.</P>
<P N="1">1.) <HI>To a firm and un&s;haken Confidence in Him under all Adver&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P>This is one important End for which the merciful Ap|pearances of GOD for our Fathers in their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es are to be recollected.&mdash;He commanded our Fathers that they &s;hou'd make them known to their Children, that they might &s;et their Hope in GOD.</P>

<P><PB N="28" REF="007020_0031_102AE9DC94731B80">
This al&s;o is another important U&s;e to be made of them.&mdash;That they might &s;et their Hope in GOD, and not forget his Works, <HI>but keep his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>And without a &s;incere Regard to divine Precepts, our Confidence will be Pre&s;umption.&mdash;For there is no Promi&s;e of Protection or Ble&s;&s;ing to &s;uch as per&s;evere in Di&s;obe|dience and Unbelief.&mdash;</P>
<P>If ye forget the Works of the LORD, and walk not in his Ways, ye may well expect to be abandon'd to all Evil.&mdash;This is evident from the Hi&s;tory of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>&mdash;For when <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> and all that Generation were gathered to their Fathers; and there aro&s;e another Generation, who knew not the Works of the LORD, which he had done in <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> They for&s;ook the LORD GOD of their Fathers, and fol|low'd after the Gods of the People that were round about them, and provoked the LORD to Anger&mdash;And he de|liver'd them into the Hands of Spoilers, that &s;poiled them, and &s;old them into the Hands of their Enemies round about, &s;o that they cou'd not &s;tand any longer be|fore their Enemies.&mdash;</P>
<P>Whether&s;oever they went out, the Hand of the LORD was again&s;t them for Evil; as the LORD had &s;aid, and as the LORD had &s;worn unto them, and they were greatly, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;</P>
<P>Mu&s;e therefore on his Wonders of old, and on his Works in the Days of your Fathers, 'till the Fire &s;hall burn within you&mdash;'till &s;acred Ardors &s;hall ri&s;e in your Souls, and animate you to the mo&s;t chearful Tru&s;t and Obedience.&mdash;</P>
<P>Ye are the Seed of the ble&s;&s;ed of the LORD, and the Children of the Covenant which he made with them&mdash;
<PB N="29" REF="007020_0032_102AE9E01786D3C0">
Fulfil therefore the Obligations, as ye expect the Ble&s;&s;ings of that Covenant.&mdash;Let your Hearts be &s;tedfa&s;t in it.</P>
<P>Be ambitious of imitating whatever was excellent in your Ance&s;tors&mdash;Con&s;ider from whence ye are fallen&mdash;Your Works are not perfect before GOD: Remember therefore how ye have received and heard, and repent&mdash;and &s;trengthen the Things that remain &amp; are ready to die.</P>
<P>Is not this the Voice of your Fathers, <Q>And ye our Children, know ye the GOD of your Fathers, and &s;erve him with perfect Hearts and willing Minds; if ye &s;eek him he will be found of you, but if you for&s;ake him he will ca&s;t you off forever.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Your Fathers bare the Heat and Burden of the Day, they &s;ubmitted to many Hard&s;hips &amp; Dangers; not only that they might leave unto you a fair temporal Inheri|tance, as it is this Day; but al&s;o, what they e&s;teem'd in|finitely preferable, that they might leave you in the En|joyment of the Go&s;pel in its Purity&mdash;For the Sake of This, they ventured their Lives into this Wilderne&s;s&mdash;For This, they expos'd them&s;elves to Perils by Sea, to Perils in the Wilderne&s;s, to Perils by the Heathen, and to various Evils.</P>
<P>And ye are ri&s;en up in your Fathers Stead; and Pro&s;|perity &s;hines in full Orb upon you&mdash;Stand fa&s;t therefore in the <HI>Liberty</HI> wherewith CHRIST hath made you free.&mdash;</P>
<P>Give Commandment to your Hou&s;holds, and to your Seed after you, to walk in all the Commandments &amp; Or|dinances of the LORD blamele&s;s, and to do Mercy and Judgment&mdash;That they al&s;o may give the &s;ame in Charge to theirs&mdash;from Generation to Generation&mdash;</P>
<P>That the divine Ble&s;&s;ing may be upon them, and the Kingdom of GOD be advanced by them.</P>
