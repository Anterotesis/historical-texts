In the Words of my <HI>Text,</HI> the Prophet declared to the <HI>Jews</HI> the fir&s;t Vi&s;ion that he receiv'd. He had before call'd them to Re|pentance, exhorted them to turn unto God, and a&s;&s;ur'd them that if they did &s;o the Lord of Ho&s;ts would turn unto them.

He is &s;tiled
<PB N="8" REF="003030_0006_0FEFAF5360BA3450">
the <HI>Angel of the Lord</HI>; and this is one of Chri&s;t's Titles. He is &s;o call'd, not in regard of the Na|ture he a&s;&s;um'd, but the Office he undertook.

Now he whom the Prophet &s;aw in this Vi&s;ion, is &s;tiled the Angel, and the Angel of the Lord, in the Context, and this Title belonging to Chri&s;t, may we not &s;uppo&s;e that he was the Per&s;on here repre&s;ented?

<P><HI>Furthermore,</HI> this Man, this Angel, whom the Prophet &s;aw, made Interce&s;&s;ion for the Church, V. 12. <HI>Then the Angel of the Lord an&s;wered and &s;aid, O Lord of bo&s;ts, how long wilt thou not have Mercy on Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &amp;c.

the only Mediator between God and Man.

<P>This portended Blood and Slaughter to the Enemies of Chri&s;t, and of his Church: That the Hor&s;e on which the Saviour of God's people rideth, &s;hould be died red with the blood of their Enemies. A red Hor&s;e was in &s;acred Vi|&s;ions Symbolical of great &s;laughter and de&s;tructi|on: Rev. 6.4. <HI>There went out another Hor&s;e that was red, and power was given to him that &s;at thereon, to take peace from the Earth, and that they &s;hould kill one another, and there was given unto him a great Sword.</HI> The Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> in like manner as <HI>Zechariah</HI> did, &s;aw Chri&s;t's martial Glory, and &s;pake of him: He &s;aw this &s;ame victorious War|rior in red Apparel, and was told the rea&s;on of his appearing in &s;uch a Habit; which explains to us his riding upon a red Hor&s;e.

For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.</HI> He was red in his Apparel, to &s;hew that when the day determined for the taking vengeance on his and his People's Enemies, and the time fix'd for the deliverance of the Church, &s;hould come, he would make &s;uch dreadful &s;laughter as a mighty Conqueror doth when he be&s;mears all his Garments with the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of his Enemies.

His Wrath a|gain&s;t his Enemies is &s;o &s;evere, and his victory, over them &s;o glorious, that even the Hor&s;e on which he rides, conquering and to conquer, is died red with the blood of War.

<P>The Myrtles are valuable, verdant Trees; and &s;o fit Emblems of the excellent, flouri&s;hing and fruitful Servants of God.

<P>The Prophet &s;aw a goodly Troop behind the Man riding on a red Hor&s;e: He &s;aw a Company of Hor&s;es, with their Riders doubtle&s;s, having every one a Slaughter-weapon in his hand, mar|&s;halled to Battle, under the Command of a glori|ous Captain; whom <HI>Zechariah</HI> (as it &s;eems) quick|ly perceiv'd to be a divine Per&s;on, the ble&s;&s;ed Angel of the Covenant, and therefore apply'd him&s;elf to him as his Lord, de&s;iring to know what tho&s;e were behind him. &mdash; v. 9, 10. <HI>Then &s;aid I, O my Lord, what are the&s;e?

Heirs of Salvation</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 1.14.</NOTE>? The Account which is in our Context given of the Hor&s;es behind the Man &s;tanding among the Myrtle-trees, agrees with that which the Apo&s;tle gives of the holy Angels of God: They are &s;uch whom the Lord &s;ends forth, and improves as chief Mini&s;ters of his Providence. This was not the only time that Angels appear'd in the form of Hor&s;es; See 2. King 6.17. Zech. 6.2, 3. Hor&s;es are Em|blems of Angels, in regard of their &s;wiftne&s;s, &s;trength and courage. The Angels were in this Vi&s;ion repre&s;ented by Hor&s;es of divers Colours, <HI>red, &s;peckled and white</HI>; &s;ignifying the various Offices to which they are deputed, and the diffe|rent Events of Providence in which they are made u&s;e of, and perhaps alluding (as One &s;ug|ge&s;teth) <Q>to the diver&s;ities of Colours in the &s;tandards of an Army, for Soldiers to know their Leaders, and keep Rank and Order.</Q>&mdash; We &s;hall con&s;ider the Angels now only in their Martial Character, for they are here repre&s;ented in a War-like Po&s;ture, formed into a &s;trong Bat|talion: And they are in Scripture termed an <HI>Ho&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Army of Heaven.</HI> They are good Soldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: are under his Command: This was &s;ignified by the place in which they appear'd; <HI>Behind</HI> the Man riding on a red Hor&s;e. The Captain of our Salvation, is Captain-Gene|ral of the heavenly Ho&s;t. By Right of Creation, the Son of God is the Lord and Leader of An|gels; <HI>for by him were all things Created that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principali|ties, or Powers: all things were Created by him, and

<P>And he employs them,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>For the defence and &s;alvation of his People,</HI> while they remain in this World, and when they pa&s;s into another. The holy Angels protect and deliver the Servants of Chri&s;t in this World, both from their bodily, and their &s;piritual Enemies. From their <HI>bodily Enemies</HI>; P&s;al. 34.7. <HI>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</HI> But, how can an Angel en|camp about the Multitude who fear God? En|camping about them imports an Ho&s;t's &s;urroun|ding of them, to guard them from dangers on every &s;ide. &mdash; I an&s;wer, that either the Singu|lar Number is here put for the Plural, as it is in other Texts of Scripture; or el&s;e, by the Angel of the Lord is here meant Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who ap|points an Army of Created Angels to encamp about his People. They are a con&s;tant, &s;trong and faithful Life-Guard to the Saints, who are

way-lay'd by Enemies whither&s;oever they go. P&s;al. 91.11, 12, 13. <HI>He &s;hall give his Angels Charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They &s;hall bear thee up in their hands, le&s;t thou da&s;h thy foot again&s;t a Stone. Thou &s;halt tread on the Lion, and Adder: the young Lion and the Dragon &s;halt thou trample under feet.</HI> They &s;hrowd them under the Wings of their kind Protection; oppo&s;e and hinder the malicious De&s;igns, even of their bodily Foes.</P>
<P>When <HI>E&s;au</HI> was coming to meet <HI>Jacob,</HI> and four hundred Men with him, to de&s;troy his Bro|ther; <HI>Jacob went on his way, and the Angels of God met him. And when Jacob &s;aw them, he &s;aid, This is God's ho&s;t: and he called the Name of that place Ma|hanaim</HI>: two Ho&s;ts, or Camps&punc; Gen. 32.1, 2. Troops of holy Angels met him, to a&s;&s;ure him that they would fight for him again&s;t his Brother <HI>E&s;au,</HI> if there &s;hould be any Occa&s;ion therefor. When the King of <HI>Syria</HI> &s;ent a great Ho&s;t, both with Hor&s;es and Chariots, again&s;t the Prophet of the Lord, <HI>Behold, the Mountain was full of Hor&s;es, and Chariots of fire round about Eli&s;ha.</HI> 2 King. 6 17. There was a Guard of mighty Angels about him. When the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were fall'n into the hands of their bloody Per&s;ecutors, <HI>the Angel of the Lord by Night opened the Pri&s;on-doors, and brought them forth.</HI> Act. 5.19. All the Locks and Bars of the Pri&s;on, and the Vigilance and Strength of the Keepers of it, could not detain them, when the Angel came to bring them forth. Thus, the Angels are em|ploy'd by Chri&s;t for the Temporal Defence and Deliverance of his People. &mdash; And they are &s;o likewi&s;e for their Defence again&s;t Spiritual Ene|mies.

The good Angels vigorou&s;ly re&s;i&s;t the evil Spirits, and prevent their accompli&s;hing of their wicked, mi&s;chievous De|&s;igns. They often times &s;ecure the Servants of Chri&s;t from the Wiles, and &s;hield them from the fiery Darts of Satan. When the <HI>Devil left Chri&s;t, behold, Angels came, and mini&s;tred unto him.</HI> Mat. 4.11. The Angels did not come to him until the Combat was over, and the Devil had quitted the Field: But they come, and mini&s;ter to Be|lievers in their Conflicts with the Powers of darkne&s;s. They came to Congratulate Chri&s;t's victory; but they come to help the Saints obtain theirs. Je&s;us Chri&s;t did admit the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an Angel in his Agony in the Garden; at which time he was doubtle&s;s mo&s;t violently a&s;&s;aulted by the Devil: Luk. 22.43. <HI>There appeared an Angel unto him from Heaven, &s;trengthning him.</HI> This might be, to encourage and a&s;&s;ure his followers, that they &s;hou'd have Angels to &s;trengthen them again&s;t their &s;piritual Enemies, whom they mu&s;t re&s;i&s;t unto blood, with Agonies &s;triving again&s;t Sin.</P>
<P>Holy Angels are employed by Chri&s;t for the Defence of his People, not only while they con|tinue in this World, but al&s;o when they pa&s;s in|to the next: Not only before, but al&s;o after Death They may &s;ometimes guard the dead

Bodies of the Saints. <HI>Michael the Arch-Angel contended with the Devil about the Body of Mo&s;es.</HI> Jude v. 9. Men have differently conjectur'd what the ground of that Conte&s;t was. <HI>One</HI> thinks, "that Satan re&s;olv'd to do &s;ome harm to the dead Body of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> that Man of God; which <HI>Michael</HI> and his Retinue perceiving, watch'd over it, carefully defended it, and would not &s;uffer the infernal Spirits to &s;eize on it". Whether this were the Controver&s;y betwixt <HI>Mi|chael</HI> and the Devil about the Body of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> or not, I pretend not to &s;ay, for the Scriptures are &s;ilent concerning it: neither do they expre&s;ly tell us that the good Angels guard the Saints Bodies after Death: Yet it is not altogether im|probable, that they &s;ometimes do this kind Of|fice for them: for <HI>precious in the &s;ight of the Lord is the death of his Saints</HI>; &s;o precious, as that he may give Angels charge concerning their Du&s;t, to keep it from being attack'd and abus'd by malicious Men and Devils.&mdash; But, whether the Angels guard the dead Bodies of the Saints, or not, we know that they are the Convoys of their happy Souls to Paradi&s;e. <HI>There appeared a Chariot of Fire, and Hor&s;es of Fire,</HI> i. e. holy An|gels, to conduct <HI>Elijah</HI> to Heaven, 2 King. 2.11. The Hor&s;es behind Chri&s;t, the ble&s;&s;ed Angels under his command, are as really, tho' not &s;o vi&s;ibly, &s;ent by him, to conduct the Souls of all Believers to Heaven. Luk. 16.22. <HI>It came to pa&s;s that the Beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into</HI> Abraham<HI>'s Bo&s;om.</HI> The mighty Angels guard the Souls of Believers thro' the Territories of the Prince of the Power of the Air; protect them from malicious Spirits, who, like Birds of Prey, watch to &s;eize upon them in their &s;light

<P>Thus Je&s;us Chri&s;t employs the holy Angels, in a military way, for the Defence and Salva|tion of his People.</P>
<P N="2">2. He employs them for the <HI>De&s;truction</HI> of his and his People's Enemies. We find in our Con|text, that tho&s;e whom the Prophet &s;aw behind the Man that &s;tood among the Myrtle-trees, were &s;ent forth as Spies, to di&s;cover the Po&s;ture which the Enemies were in: and they are &s;ent forth al&s;o, as Armies, to vanqui&s;h and de&s;troy them.
