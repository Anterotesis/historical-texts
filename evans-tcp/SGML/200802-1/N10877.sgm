<P>GOOD civil government is one of the greate&s;t temporal ble&s;&s;ings which any people are favored with. Without this we cannot be &s;afe and &s;ecure in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any worldly good. Our vir|tue and happine&s;s, our lives and property would be expo&s;ed to innumerable continued dangers from the unre&s;trained lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;i|ons of mankind. One would lie at the mer|cy of another: and he who found him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t &s;trength and power, would &s;acrifice all that is dear to others, to his
<PB N="6" REF="013769_0004_0F91ACA74D853E20">
own will and plea&s;ure. Where there is no law or government, every one will "do that which is right in his own eyes," as <HI>they</HI> did when there was no king in I&s;rael. Government is as an "hedge about our per&s;ons, and about all that we have on every &s;ide," again&s;t the ra|vages and depredations of lawle&s;s men, men who have nothing to govern them, but their own wills, pa&s;&s;ions and appetites. Says St. Paul, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 1.8, 9, 10.</NOTE> "We know that the law is good, if a man u&s;e it lawfully; knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawle&s;s and di&s;obedient, for the ungodly and for &s;inners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mo|thers, for man-&s;layers, for whoremongers, for them that defile them&s;elves with mankind, for men-&s;tealers, for liars, for perjured per&s;ons, and if there be any other thing that is contra|ry to &s;ound doctrine."</P>
<P>THE &s;in and fall of man gave occa&s;ion for civil government in &s;ocieties, as a nece&s;&s;ary curb and re&s;traint to the corrupt lu&s;ts and vile affections of human kind. Had man ne|ver &s;inned he would not have been under the influence of unruly di&s;orderly lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;i|ons: he would not have been &s;o di&s;po&s;ed to tran&s;gre&s;s the eternal and unalterable rules of
<PB N="7" REF="013769_0005_0F91ACA8452E2FE8">
equity and truth; but would have "lived &s;o|berly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in the world."</P>
<P>IT was evidently in compa&s;&s;ion to a fallen degenerate world that God in&s;tituted and or|dained civil government, and that he was him&s;elf, in a &s;pecial and peculiar &s;en&s;e, the &s;upreme magi&s;trate in I&s;rael, appointing &s;u|bordinate officers and judges, more immedi|ately to manage the affairs of their &s;tate, un|der his direction and guidance.</P>
<P>THE divine Being has, all along, abundant|ly manife&s;ted his approbation of civil govern|ment. He was <HI>indeed</HI> angry with his people of old, for rejecting him, who was King of kings, and Lord of lords, from being their king, and a&s;king <HI>him</HI> to give them a king like unto the heathen nations round about. This was a &s;in in them: and the very thing they de&s;ired, became a &s;nare and a &s;courge unto them. It had been well for them, and all &s;ucceeding nations, had their original form of government been &s;trictly adhered to, grate|fully accepted, and well improved. They &s;ought a change, and God granted their re|que&s;t. Since when, <HI>he</HI> has been plea&s;ed, in his holy word, very particularly, to point out the qualifications of "princes" and rulers, and the duty of the people, to &s;ubmit to their
<PB N="8" REF="013769_0006_0F91ACA8688A3068">
authority and laws, withal intimating that <HI>good</HI> rulers are a ble&s;&s;ing, great benefactors to mankind. "He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God; and he &s;hall be as the light of the morning, when the &s;un ri&s;eth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the earth by clear &s;hining after rain," <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. 23.3.4.</NOTE> &s;ays God.</P>
<P>NO particular form of government has un|erring wi&s;dom pointed out, pre&s;cribed and di|rected unto. But mankind, in their various di&s;per&s;ions through the earth, and different nations, are left wholly to their liberty to agree upon their own plan and con&s;titution, their particular model of government, and to depute whom, and as few, or as many, as they &s;hall think fit, to rule and govern them, being to obey and &s;ubmit to them, whom <HI>they</HI> have thus clothed with authority, "not only for wrath, but for con&s;cience &s;ake." The &s;uppo|&s;ition of a divine hereditary right in &s;ome, to govern the re&s;t, is glaringly ab&s;urd and ground|le&s;s. God's &s;etting a&s;ide Saul and his family, and bringing David, the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e, to be the king of I&s;rael, together with the parable of Jotham, recorded in the book of God, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Judg. 9.7&mdash;15.</NOTE> being well weighed and attentively con&s;ider|ed,
<PB N="9" REF="013769_0007_0F91ACA950F4ED58">
prove that &s;uch right cannot be founded on the Bible. And where can we go to find and prove this doctrine of the divine heredita|ry right of particular per&s;ons and families to rule and govern others, if not to the revelation from heaven. A people may, if they plea&s;e, make the kingdom hereditary, in a particular family, under certain limita|tions and re&s;trictions; (as is the ca&s;e in Eng|land); and whoever claims a right to the Bri|ti&s;h throne, contrary to &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hed rules, is a daring u&s;urper, and impudent pretender; and this has been the character of &s;ome of the inglorious and tyrannical Stewart family, ever &s;ince the reign of James the &s;econd. The people of England after various &s;truggles and conte&s;ts, and having tried many very different forms of government, at length happily unit|ed tho&s;e three leading kinds, monarchy, ari&s;|tocracy and democracy, which compo&s;ed that excellent civil con&s;titution, which has been the glory of Britons, and the envy of foreigners. Says one, "All power has its foundation in compact and mutual con&s;ent, or el&s;e it pro|ceeds from fraud or violence. Where the lat|ter takes place, the dominion which men claim is no better than u&s;urpation; and they who by the&s;e methods rai&s;e them&s;elves above their brethren, are &s;o far from having a right to govern, that they ought to be puni&s;hed as
<PB N="10" REF="013769_0008_0F91ACAB433B2DD0">
public di&s;turbers and the enemies of man|kind.&mdash;When government is founded in mu|tual con&s;ent, it is the undoubted right of the community to &s;ay who &s;hall govern them; and to make what limitations or conditions they think proper.&mdash;But whatever form of civil government men have cho&s;e, there are certain con&s;titutions which are the ba&s;is and foundation of the &s;tate, and which are obliga|tory on tho&s;e who govern, as well as on tho&s;e who are governed. The&s;e con&s;titutions are a &s;ort of fundamental laws, which cannot be violated without the greate&s;t danger to a com|munity. When either part attempts to invade the right of the other, it u&s;ually pro|duces convul&s;ions, which &s;ooner or later over|turn the &s;tate." The king of England, at his coronation, is &s;worn to defend the rights of the people, and to govern according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution, the fundamental laws and &s;tatutes of the realm. The Briti&s;h con&s;ti|tution, in its primitive purity, is the mo&s;t per|fect form of civil government, becau&s;e it de|rives and &s;ecures the greate&s;t <HI>good</HI> to the whole nation, which is the end of all civil government. Finite beings can conceive of no other end, the divine Being could have in view, in the ordination and appointment of civil govern|ment, and &s;etting &s;ome over their <HI>brethren,</HI> but the <HI>good</HI> of the people. Rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ts
<PB N="11" REF="013769_0009_0F91ACABC49B9C78">
no other, nor does revelation &s;peak of any but <HI>this.</HI> The &s;cripture a&s;&s;ures us that magi&s;trates are appointed of God to be his mini&s;ters for <HI>good</HI> to the public. He did not appoint &s;uch an order of men, for the purpo&s;es of en&s;laving the re&s;t, and involving the world in mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s, nor &s;urely to enrich and aggrandize them&s;elves and families, at the un|nece&s;&s;ary expence, and great damage of the public, as if God had a partiality for <HI>them.</HI> He did indeed intend, that princes and rulers, continually attending on this very thing, <HI>the public good,</HI> and &s;eeking the welfare of the &s;tate, and the happine&s;s of the people, &s;hould be honorably maintained, and di&s;tingui&s;hingly &s;upported, as but the ju&s;t recompence of their faithful and important &s;ervices for them. It is an apo&s;tolic injunction upon the people to &s;upport their rulers. "For, for this cau&s;e pay you tribute al&s;o; for they are God's mini&s;ters, attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due; cu&s;tom, to whom cu&s;|tom, fear, to whom fear, honor, to whom ho|nor." Where government &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;upported and maintained. This will create burdens for the people, but bur|dens which they will chearfully bear, and go through, while they feel the <HI>benefit</HI> of their rulers mild, rea&s;onable, righteous,
<PB N="12" REF="013769_0010_0F91ACAC78D6A8C0">
ju&s;t and impartial admini&s;tration. The peo|ple are bound in ju&s;tice and equity to &s;upport them, who employ their time and talents in the public &s;ervice. While &s;erving the peo|ple, <HI>they</HI> ought to be maintained in ea&s;e and honor, according to their rank and &s;tation, and the degrees of &s;ervice, by them, done to the community. They &s;hould have their minds freed from all anxiety and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing concern, as to their own and their families &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence in the world. That rulers &s;hould &s;a|crifice their own e&s;tates and fortunes in the &s;ervice of the people, is not ju&s;t or rea&s;onable. Men who &s;erve others ought to be rewarded in proportion to the time they &s;pend, and the <HI>benefit</HI> thence re&s;ulting to <HI>them</HI> for whom they labor. "The laborer is worthy of his hire." And I &s;ee not why rulers, and others, who are wholly devoted to public bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;pend all their time, (if need be) and talents therein, ought not to be more than barely &s;upported, and maintained in character; why they ought not to be enabled, in that way, to lay up for their families and children, in &s;ome proporti|on, as it might be &s;uppo&s;ed they probably would, by prudence, hone&s;ty and diligence in any other lawful calling. Par&s;imony in a peo|ple towards "princes," and rulers, or the mi|ni&s;ters of Chri&s;t, is a great &s;in, and has a natu|ral tendency to defeat the de&s;igns of heaven, in
<PB N="13" REF="013769_0011_0F91ACAD2D73FC80">
their appointment to office. But with regard to the &s;upport due to civil government from the governed, there is a mea&s;ure, beyond which, taxes impo&s;ed on them, are but extor|tion and oppre&s;&s;ion. "There is nothing that affects men more, than when you touch their intere&s;t; people in general find it hard to procure the conveniencies of life; nothing will &s;ooner alienate their minds from govern|ment, than when rulers needle&s;ly deprive them of that which they have dearly earned, and wantonly di&s;&s;ipate the public trea&s;ures. Ru|lers ought ever to proceed in this part of their duty with caution and prudence, that people may &s;ee the taxes they impo&s;e are not to gra|tify their pride, their avarice, or any other pa&s;|&s;ion; not to carry on any private de&s;ign, "but that they are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of government and the exigencies of the &s;tate." Rulers &s;hould be men hating covetou&s;ne&s;s, as well as fearing God, otherwi&s;e they will &s;acrifice the rights and property of their &s;ubjects, and &s;ometimes their lives, to gratify their pride, ambition and avarice. Naboth lo&s;t his life, through the covetou&s;ne&s;s of Ahab, who &s;ought his vineyard. When magi&s;trates neither fear God, nor regard man, in&s;tead of aiming at the public <HI>good</HI> (which is their main bu&s;ine&s;s) they will &s;tudy to advance their own private inte|re&s;t, and that of their hou&s;hold, and do any
<PB N="14" REF="013769_0012_0F91ACADD1012E10">
thing to keep in office. Sini&s;ter views govern and predominate; &s;uch men are not to be tru&s;ted. Power in their hands is dangerous; for they will &s;acrifice con&s;cience and &s;ell their country to gratify and plea&s;ure them&s;elves; or they will do this to plea&s;e tho&s;e above them, on whom they depend. Such men are ea&s;ily bought. How far this has been verifi|ed of late, in this land, I leave all to determine for them&s;elves. Rulers &s;eem to be mi&s;taken, when they act with a view only to &s;upport and pre&s;erve their own greatne&s;s and grandeur. "That the civil ruler and chri&s;tian mini&s;ter &s;hould engro&s;s the wealth of the world to them&s;elves, as they have done in many ages and countries, and live in pride and luxury, on &s;poils violently extorted or &s;lily drained from the people, is altogether foreign to the de&s;ign of God in &s;etting them up." That they ought to be &s;upported in ea&s;e and honor, we may collect from the &s;acred oracles.</P>
<P>AS good rulers, God's mini&s;ters for good to the people, are entitled to &s;ufficient and honorable maintenance, &s;o are they, to every mark of honor, e&s;teem and re&s;pect from their &s;ubjects. "Honor the king," &s;ays St. Peter. And as there are no lawful powers, but who are ordained of God; &s;o St. Paul directs us to render to <HI>&s;uch</HI> their dues; "fear to whom
<PB N="15" REF="013769_0013_0F91ACAE76B7DBB8">
fear, honor to whom honor," is due. Rulers and princes are entitled to the mo&s;t re&s;pectful treatment from the people over whom they are placed. We may not "&s;peak evil of dignities," nor "of the rulers of the people." To treat "princes" and rulers with contempt, indignity, and di&s;re&s;pect, is &s;lighting and con|temning an ordinance of God.</P>
<P>BUT not only are <HI>good</HI> "princes," and rulers to be &s;upported and honored in their &s;tations, but &s;ubmitted to and obeyed. Rea|&s;on will direct, and intere&s;t lead, all chearfully to &s;ubmit to the laws and government of <HI>&s;uch</HI> magi&s;trates; and religion mo&s;t &s;trongly en|forces the &s;ame duty&punc; St. Paul, &s;ays, "Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: The powers that be, are ordained of God, who&s;o|ever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God: And they that re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves damnation. Wherefore ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for wrath, but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake." And St. Peter exhorts. "Submit your&s;elves to every ordi|nance of man for the Lord's &s;ake: Whether it be to the king as &s;upreme; or unto go|vernors, as unto them, that are &s;ent by him." The civil ruler is the mini&s;ter of God for <HI>good</HI> to the people. While rulers pur&s;ue the
<PB N="16" REF="013769_0014_0F91ACB072F6AD38">
end of their appointment to office, &s;eeking the public good, they are to be obeyed and &s;ubmitted unto. Rulers are men of like pa&s;|&s;ions with our&s;elves; as liable to an undue bias and influence, and &s;o to errors and mi&s;takes in their conduct, as their &s;ubjects. It becomes &s;ubjects to point out the mi&s;takes which rulers run into, at any time, in their admini&s;tration; and when the&s;e are made to appear, <HI>they</HI> will, if they have the good of &s;ociety at heart, im|mediately rectify them. We may not refu&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to higher powers, becau&s;e of le&s;&s;er errors in government. Allowance ought to be made for rulers as well as others. It is the property of the divine Being only to be inca|pable of doing wrong. Every wrong &s;tep in rulers, may not proceed from a &s;ettled di&s;po|&s;ition to abu&s;e their power and injure their &s;ubjects. But when they make u&s;e of their power and authority in a manner &s;ubver&s;ive of the end of their de&s;ignation to office; when they encroach on the natural and con&s;titution|al rights of the people; when they trample on tho&s;e laws, which were made, at once to limit their power, and defend their &s;ubjects; in &s;uch ca&s;es the people are bound not to obey them, but re&s;i&s;t them as public robbers and the de&s;troyers of mankind and of human hap|pine&s;s. Says the great Mr. Lock in his trea|ti&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="013769_0015_0F91ACB0ACB22B50">
upon government. "Where&s;oever law ends, tyranny begins, if the law be tran&s;gre&s;&s;|ed to another's harm. And whoever in autho|rity, exceeds the power given him by law, and makes u&s;e of the force he hath under his com|mand, to compa&s;s that upon the &s;ubject which the law allows not, cea&s;es in that to be a magi&s;trate; and acting without authority, may be oppo&s;ed as any other man, who in|vades the right of another." And in the&s;e ca&s;es the people mu&s;t be judge of the good or ill conduct of their rulers; to the people they are accountable. It is the highe&s;t pope|ry to affirm otherwi&s;e. "The argument whereby the Apo&s;te Paul enforces his exhor|tation of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to rulers, and di&s;&s;wades from re&s;i&s;tance, is, that the&s;e civil powers are ordained of God, and ordained by him, mini&s;|terially to convey ble&s;&s;ings from him to the people. So long therefore, and &s;o far as <HI>the&s;e</HI> civil powers act agreably to the de&s;ign of their ordination, and do <HI>good</HI> in their &s;tations, the people are obliged to &s;ubjection, and re&s;i&s;tance will be blameable; but if the&s;e powers for&s;ake their proper &s;phere, thwart God's de&s;ign in ordaining them, di&s;&s;erve the people, and take mea&s;ures which tend to ruin them, the Apo&s;|tle's ground of the people's &s;ubjection cea&s;es; and, indeed, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion becomes a fault, and
<PB N="18" REF="013769_0016_0F91ACB1CB842E60">
re&s;i&s;tance a virtue. If the people ought to o|obey well conducting rulers out of regard to the public good, it mu&s;t be as much their du|ty, &s;till governed by a regard to the public good, to oppo&s;e them, when pur&s;uing de&s;truc|tive methods. To &s;uppo&s;e it belongs to the Apo&s;tle's meaning, that it is a damnable &s;in to re&s;i&s;t civil powers, <HI>becau&s;e ordained of God,</HI> though they act entirely out of character, and thwart every kind purpo&s;e God had in or|daining them, is in the cla&s;s of mo&s;t palpable grating ab&s;urdities. A pretence to ground &s;uch ideas, as tho&s;e of indefea&s;ible right, pa&s;|&s;ive obedience, and non-re&s;i&s;tance, on the Bi|ble, is criminal&mdash;an high abu&s;ive &s;candal to the Chri&s;tian religion, and its divinely in&s;pir|ed Promulgator. If God had given up man|kind to the will of oppre&s;&s;ors, not permitting the people, on pain of damnation, to attempt their own relief, it would not, indeed, have exceeded the demerit of a &s;inful world; but would have been di&s;agreable to the general a|nalogy of kind Providence." As rulers, how|ever <HI>omnipotent</HI> they may pretend to be, are not rai&s;ed above a po&s;&s;ibility of erring and mi&s;ta|king in the exerci&s;e of their power and autho|rity, &s;o it is not ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e they may, in &s;ome ca&s;es enjoin and require things of their &s;ubjects contrary to the laws of nature, which are the laws of God, and contrary al&s;o to
<PB N="19" REF="013769_0017_0F91ACB26FDEE9D0">
the Chri&s;tian religion; in which ca&s;e our duty is plain, "We mu&s;t obey God rather than men." And, "&s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bon|dage." If any come in privily to &s;py out our liberty, which we derive from the Author of nature and the Author of our mo&s;t holy faith, we may not give place to them, by &s;ubjection, no not for an <HI>hour</HI>; that the rights of nature and of con&s;cience, and the truth of the go&s;|pel, may continue with us. But not to en|large in this way.</P>
<P>HIS pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, king George the third, has in my opinion, an undoubted right to the Briti&s;h throne; but his right thereto is found|ed, if not wholly, yet principally, on the peo|ple's right to re&s;i&s;t, and &s;et a&s;ide evil and wicked rulers, rulers who trample on the fundamen|tal laws of the &s;tate, and invade their &s;ubjects rights and liberties. Had not the people re|&s;i&s;ted and removed that unhappy and mi&s;guid|ed king, Charles the fir&s;t, the nation would probably, have been ruined. King James the &s;econd, brother of Charles the &s;econd, and &s;on of Charles the fir&s;t, &s;o enraged the people, by his infatuated mea&s;ures, as that he was forced to abdicate the throne, and flee his kingdom. Then William Henry and Mary,
<PB N="20" REF="013769_0018_0F91ACB460B784D0">
prince and prince&s;s of Orange, were proclaim|ed king and queen of England. This <HI>event,</HI> called the revolution, took place in 1688. William and Mary dying without i&s;&s;ue, the prince&s;s Anna of Denmark, &s;econd daughter of king James the &s;econd, was proclaimed queen.

like all other ble&s;&s;ings, it may become a &s;courge, a cur&s;e, and &s;evere puni&s;hment to a people. "For the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a land, many are the princes thereof," &s;ays Solomon. Intimating that to have many princes in a kingdom is a ju&s;t judgement of God upon a &s;inful nation. The&s;e words may be variou&s;ly interpreted. "For the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a land, and a general defection from God, and religi|on, to idolatry, prophanene&s;s and immorality, many are the princes thereof; many at the &s;ame time pretending to the &s;overeignty, and contending for it, by which the people are crumbled into parties and factions, biting and devouring one another. Or many princes &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively in a little time, one cutting off another, or &s;oon cut off by the hand of God, or of a foreign enemy." But this word "prince," need not be under&s;tood in &s;o limited a &s;en&s;e, as intending the king, or fir&s;t magi&s;trate. It may mo&s;t properly be under&s;tood here, as meaning the nobles, coun&s;ellors, and officers in a kingdom and land; any ruler and officer among people; any who are &s;et over them to rule, order and govern them. And our text &s;peaks of it, as a puni&s;hment upon a people and land to have a <HI>multitude</HI> of princes, or ru|lers and officers. For the entertaining ju&s;t conceptions of this point, let it be ob&s;erved:

That as government was ordained of God for the "<HI>good</HI>" of the people, and not for their de&s;truction; &s;o to effect this mo&s;t valuable in|tended end, it is nece&s;&s;ary, that in every &s;tate there be as many "princes," and rulers, of one &s;ort and of another, higher and lower as &s;hall be &s;ufficient to all the purpo&s;es of good government; both for the making and exe|cuting laws, conducive to the general felicity, and that the benefits and advantages thence re|&s;ulting, may be &s;een and felt, in the remote&s;t parts of the empire.

<P>FURTHER, a large &s;tanding army, con&s;i&s;t|ing, perhaps of near an hundred thou&s;and men in all parts of the Briti&s;h dominions, is kept up, at an amazing expence to the &s;tate. Some un|der half pay, others under full pay; the high|er officers have very great wages, while the &s;oldiers have &s;canty allowance. This <HI>army</HI> is kept up to aid the civil power, it is pretend|ed; but were the requirements of civil rulers ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, there would be no occa&s;i|on of having recour&s;e to the powers of the military, to enforce obedience. When mea|&s;ures

For however there may be per&s;ons of a factious, licentious turn, yet the body of a people are di&s;po&s;ed to obedience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from a principle of &s;elf-intere&s;t, if nothing el&s;e. They are di&s;po&s;ed to "lead quiet and peaceable lives." When there ari&s;es <HI>general</HI> unea&s;ine&s;s and complaint among a people, it is a certain &s;ign things do not go well in the &s;tate, and that the mea&s;ures pur&s;uing are not ju&s;t, right and equal. A &s;tanding army kept up, as they always are, in idlene&s;s, in time of peace, are the bane of re|ligion, virtue and &s;ocial felicity, and the nur|&s;ery of the mo&s;t exuberant growth of all kinds of wickedne&s;s and debauchery. This is a plan to fright people into a compliance with favo|rite mea&s;ures, which the abettors are &s;en&s;ible mankind will not readily con&s;ent unto. And may it not be, becau&s;e they are not ju&s;t? This is a mea&s;ure unnece&s;&s;arily burden&s;ome. For "a con&s;titution which cannot &s;upport its own weight mu&s;t fall;&mdash;it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed e&s;&s;en|tially defective in its form or admini&s;tration Military aid has ever been deemed dangerous to a free civil &s;tate; and often has been u&s;ed as an effectual engine to &s;ubvert it."

When &s;tanding armies are improved, it may well a|waken the jealou&s;y of the people, and rou&s;e their attention to their deare&s;t worldly in|tere&s;ts.

<P>I GO on to &s;ay very briefly, That "by a man of under&s;tanding and knowledge the &s;tate thereof &s;hall be prolonged." Religion and knowledge will prevent or redre&s;s the grievan|ces, to which a land may be &s;ubjected, by a mulititude of "princes" and rulers. A privy coun&s;ellor, or mini&s;ter of &s;tate, or the princi|pal rulers in a kingdom, if they are men of real religion and enlarged knowledge will u&s;e their influence and power to re&s;train and &s;up|pre&s;s, "the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a land," and pur|&s;ue the be&s;t methods for healing the wounds thereof, that &s;o the good e&s;tate thereof may be prolonged. It is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to con|ceive,
<PB N="31" REF="013769_0029_0F91ACBE2A415E18">
what eminent &s;ervice one wi&s;e man may do for a nation in a difficult, critical and trouble&s;ome juncture. The wi&s;e man tells us in this chapter, where we find the text, that, "the prince who wanteth under&s;tanding is al&s;o a great oppre&s;&s;or: But he that hateth cove|tou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall prolong his days." The love of money, and the want of due con&s;ideration, are the cau&s;es of the mal-admini&s;tration of "prin|ces" and rulers. A ruler who it covetous will neither do ju&s;tly, nor love mercy, but the peo|ple under him &s;hall be bought and &s;old. But rulers who are ture fearers of God, and haters of covetou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall prolong their govern|ment and peace; they &s;hall be happy in the affections of their people, and the ble&s;&s;ings of their God. Rulers who are wi&s;e and good, will never oppre&s;s and en&s;lave their &s;ubjects, if they would con&s;ult their own intere&s;t, ea&s;e and &s;afety. Tyrants and oppre&s;&s;ors who &s;acrifice every thing to their covetou&s;ne&s;s, and ambi|tion of an ab&s;olute, arbitrary power, generally &s;uffer for their madne&s;s and folly, when an oppre&s;&s;ed and en&s;laved people are rouzed. Such rulers often fall a &s;acrifice to the rage of mankind. When they who rule over men, are per&s;ons of under&s;tanding and knowledge, not only men di&s;cerning in the times and &s;ea|&s;ons, knowing what I&s;rael ought to do, but
<PB N="32" REF="013769_0030_0F91ACC020B3C7C8">
men of real goodne&s;s and religion, are "ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God," the &s;tate of that people will be pro&s;perous, flouri&s;hing, and happy: Such rulers will be a God-like ble&s;&s;|ing. Says God by the mouth of his &s;ervant king David, "they &s;hall be as the light of the morning, when the &s;un ri&s;eth, even as a morning without clouds; as the tender gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the earth by clear &s;hining af|ter rain." The character and exten&s;ive be|neficence of the faithful ruler, are here repre|&s;ented, who with a God-like ardor employs his authority and influence to advance the common intere&s;t; The righteous Lord, who&s;e countenance beholdeth the upright, will &s;up|port and &s;ucceed rulers of this character: And it is an evidence of his favor to a peo|ple, when &s;uch are apponited to rule over them. The natural effect of this, is quietne&s;s and peace, as &s;howers upon the tender gra&s;s and clear &s;hining after rain. In this ca&s;e a loyal people mu&s;t be happy, and fully &s;en&s;ible that they are &s;o&mdash;while they find their per&s;ons in &s;afety&mdash;their liberties pre&s;erved&mdash;their pro|perty defended&mdash;and their confidence in their rulers entire.

<P>IN the morning I expatiated upon the great ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>good</HI> civil government, and con&s;idered the grand end and de&s;ign of the in&s;titution&mdash;Then ob&s;erved that, as great a ble&s;&s;ing as civil government was, it might be &s;o conducted as to become a cur&s;e, a judg|ment and puni&s;hment to a land: And it is &s;o, when the "princes," or rulers "thereof are many," many more than are nece&s;&s;ary to pro|mote and effect the great end of government, the good of the community, and when by be|ing multiplied in a land, the burdens of the

people mu&s;t be greatly, needle&s;sly and very unprofitably increa&s;ed, and <HI>they</HI> impoveri&s;hed and en&s;laved: While men, or rulers of under|&s;tanding and knowledge, rulers of religion and piety as well as great di&s;cernment, by their wi&s;e, prudent and righteous admini&s;tra|tion, will prolong the &s;tate, the tranquility, and happine&s;s of the land.</P>
<P>BUT as the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Briti&s;h em|pire indicates that civil government is made a &s;courge and puni&s;hment unto the people, &s;o our part, my hearers, and the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of this day, is to enquire and con&s;ider what are the moral cau&s;es of this puni&s;hment, to humble our&s;elves before God, and while his judgments are abroad in the earth, learn righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent <HI>multitude</HI> of "princes," or rulers in the land, and their enormous, gi|gantic &s;trides after di&s;potic government and arbitrary power, our text teaches us to con&s;ider as a ju&s;t judgment of heaven, and a righteous puni&s;hment upon "the land" (as in|flicted by God) for the many provoking &s;ins, and daring "tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions" of the people. "Our adver&s;ity is to be con&s;idered, as the ef|fect of <HI>providential</HI> agency or permi&s;&s;ion&mdash;as a righteous parental cha&s;ti&s;ement of heaven,

for our many provacations; and a loud call for univer&s;al repentance and reformation, ac|cording to the go&s;pel or Chri&s;t." While therefore, the language of this day's &s;olemni|ties &s;eems to be this, that with all humility we confe&s;s our &s;ins to God, and "come boldly to the throne of grace that we may find mercy to pardon," and with fulle&s;t confidence are committing our cau&s;e to the God of infinite wi&s;dom, putting up fervent prayers to that Being, who is able to &s;ave; we &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, con&s;ider our indi&s;pen&s;able obliga|tions, and the nece&s;&s;ity of "adding to" our prayers and &s;upplications, true and unfeigned repentance, as ever we would hope to obtain audience of Him, "who loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s, and hateth iniquity."

<P>OUR ance&s;tors, who fir&s;t came into this country, and their immediate po&s;terity, were a pious, a holy and a praying people, and God had a favor for them.

<P>WITH regard to the duty laid upon India teas, I cannot help thinking, (though &s;ome po&s;&s;ibly may call this &s;uper&s;tition) that it is a ju&s;t judgment, and righteous puni&s;hment upon this people, for their vile abu&s;e, and pro&s;titu|tion of that article of foreign trade, and I may add, <HI>needle&s;s</HI> luxury. To me it appears, that by means of this article of tea, the people of this land, have run into exce&s;&s;es of wickedne&s;s, great beyond all account. Many have fool|i&s;hly laid out their money for <HI>this,</HI> who could &s;carce procure the <HI>nece&s;&s;aries</HI> of life, and for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e it was fa&s;hionable.

Is it po&s;&s;ible to tell how much time has been fooli&s;hly &s;pent, principal|ly, but not altogether, among them, who are above the common level of mankind? Much time has been lo&s;t, which might have been more profitably &s;pent at home in their own proper bu&s;ine&s;s. Is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how much actual wickedne&s;s has been committed by people, (when vi&s;iting one another for the &s;ake of tea, chiefly) in idle, vain and &s;inful conver&s;ation, in freely handling the characters of others, &s;landering and defaming of them; together with a pretence among many at &s;uch times, to a power of revealing &s;ecrets, or fore|telling future events, which, in whatever light we view it, mu&s;t be evil. For a knowledge of any future events comes not from God in that way. If any per&s;ons have this power it mu&s;t be derived from &s;ome evil &s;pirit.

Though a free trade to foreign countries, well managed, may be a great be|nefit, yet it may be <HI>abu&s;ed,</HI> and prove a real damage to the land. Many things ab&s;olutely &s;urperflous are imported; things which tend on|ly to feed our pride and vanity. Many things are imported, which might be manufactured among our&s;elves, va&s;tly to our own advan|tage. It is greatly to the intere&s;t of any coun|try to encourage all kinds of manufactures. But we have too generally contracted a di&s;|ta&s;te to what is home-made, and think we mu&s;t go abroad for food and cloathing.

Be&s;ides, multitudes in all parts are running in|to trade, which is a real damage to the com|munity: were they employed in handling the plow, (a work many of them are much fit|ter for) and turning the wilderne&s;s into a fruitful field, they would do more eminent &s;ervice to their country, and, no doubt, to them&s;elves.

I would here a&s;k, have not &s;ome people, under the notion of zeal for liberty, run into the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s, and been guilty, in one place and an|other, of the mo&s;t lawle&s;s, unju&s;t, and tyran|nical proceedings, &s;uch as pulling down and de&s;troying hou&s;es, abu&s;ing per&s;ons, endanger|ing mens lives, de&s;troying their property, breaking windows, delivering pri&s;oners out of the hands of ju&s;tice, <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">If there be any law of this province, allowing creditors to keep debtors in jail, as long as they plea&s;e, even after it appears that they have nothing wherewith to pay, it is with all deference and mo|de&s;ty &s;ubmitted to our legi&s;lature, whether &s;uch a law does not contradict the laws of nature and of Chri&s;|tianity, and if it does, whether it ought not to be re|pealed!</NOTE> and putting ma|ny into great fears; all contrary to the good and whole&s;ome laws of this province?

in rulers and "princes," they are the common fruit of grievous, oppre&s;&s;ive and uncon&s;tituti|onal acts of government. There was nothing of this kind among us, until the ever memora|ble <HI>&s;tamp-act</HI> took place. Solomon has long &s;ince, ob&s;erved, that "oppre&s;&s;ion maketh a wi&s;e man mad." But &s;uch lawle&s;s mea&s;ures are not to be ju&s;tified; they ought not to be coun|tenanced, or tolerated by any, nor have they been, by many. They do not always an&s;wer a valuable purpo&s;e, but evil generally comes thereof; they excite a &s;pirit of revenge in the &s;ufferers, and revenge has been pur&s;ued unto the utmo&s;t, the bitter and &s;evere fruits where|of we are now reaping. In the&s;e times, when the general cry has been for liberty, have not &s;ome per&s;ons in the land, of a querulous, fac|tious and licentious turn, &s;lid into the dan|gerous extreme of de&s;pi&s;ing all government, and endeavoured to put down all rule, order, government and authority, both in church and &s;tate? Has not rea&s;onable, ju&s;t and mild government, in &s;ome parts of the land, been trampled on and &s;purned at, and <HI>good</HI> rulers reviled, &s;lighted and &s;et at nought? Liberty, my brethren, is a precious and ine&s;timable jewel, and ought to be u&s;ed with utmo&s;t cauti|on and delicacy. It may be as much abu&s;ed as government and power, leading into mea|&s;ures equally tyrannical and oppre&s;&s;ive. The
<PB N="55" REF="013769_0053_0F91ACD9826A9760">
people who re&s;i&s;t and counteract well conduc|ted civil admini&s;tration, and trample upon the good and whol&s;ome laws of the land, &s;hould con&s;ider that they "re&s;i&s;t an ordinance of God, and they who re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves damnation."

<P>BUT to proceed: In the act for regulating the civil government of this province, it is propo&s;ed that towns &s;hould be deprived of the liberty, which the laws of this province have given them, of meeting when they plea&s;e, and acting upon whatever to them, may &s;eem meet and good. And here it may be a&s;ked, Have not &s;ome towns in the land &s;inned great|ly, and highly provoked God, by an abu&s;e of the liberty and power by law given to them? Has no town done things mon&s;trou&s;ly injuri|ous and oppre&s;&s;ive? And have not the "cries of the injured, entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth?" It is po&s;&s;ible that, under color of law, and that plea that all mu&s;t be bound in <HI>all ca&s;es</HI> by the vote of the majority, even things mo&s;t unju&s;t and unrighteous, may be tran&s;acted. It is very difficult, if not im|po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="56" REF="013769_0054_0F91ACD9A3B66CF0">
to frame laws in &s;uch a manner, as to prevent every &s;pecies of inju&s;tice and iniquity. Are not towns therefore, which have been guilty of a perver&s;ion of their liberty, in judg|ment, and as a proper puni&s;hment, to be a|bridged thereof. Though, I grant, it looks mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t, that innocent places &s;hould &s;uffer with the guilty.</P>
<P>FURTHER: The manner of returning jury|men is by the above act to be altered, and the privilege granted, by our laws, to towns to re|turn them, is to be wre&s;ted from them. And have not &s;ome towns &s;inned greatly in the &s;ight of God, by trifling, in the mo&s;t daring manner with this invaluable privilege, which has been looked upon as our main &s;ecurity a|gain&s;t the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of power. Have not &s;ome places returned &s;uch per&s;ons, to &s;erve as grand jurymen, and jurymen on trials, in mo&s;t intere&s;ting and important cau&s;es, as neither fear God, nor regard man? Per&s;ons, who not only have no religion, but are enemies to all religion and goodne&s;s; men who can dei&s;tical|ly reproach the excellent, well atte&s;ted religi|on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and bla&s;pheme its divine Author? Men "who fear not an oath? Per|&s;ons who have no regard to religion, to divine revelation, will never think them&s;elves bound to regard an oath; they can, and often do,

trifle with it. Have there been no in&s;tances wherein per&s;ons of this ca&s;t, have been really picked, to &s;erve a turn? Are our lives, our intere&s;t, our property more &s;afe in the hands of &s;uch per&s;ons, than they would be in the hands of a jury returned by the &s;heriff? The remedy provided again&s;t this evil by the act of the Briti&s;h court, is as bad as the di&s;ea&s;e; for although it may prevent &s;ome evils, it will create more. Some other, better and more effectual remedy, might be provided by our own legi&s;lature, and really ought to be; for this is a "crying iniquity in our <HI>high places.</HI>"</P>
<P>FURTHER, By the above mentioned act, the liberty of our choo&s;ing our own coun&s;el|lors is to be taken from us, and put into the hands of the crown: This, if it takes place, mu&s;t ere long, have a va&s;t influence on our liberty, laws and religion. And we may ex|pect that &s;ome alteration will &s;oon be made in the form of choo&s;ing our own repre&s;entatives. When the&s;e deare&s;t liberties are threat|ned, does it not become this people, &s;eriou&s;ly to a&s;k whether they have not, by an abu&s;e hereof, offended the mo&s;t high God? We have all along had great and good men in the two hou&s;es of a&s;&s;embly; men of great abili|ties, fearing God and hating covetou&s;ne&s;s. But have they all been of this character? Have

Electors ought to have a regard to the religious and moral characters of the men, whom they ap|point to rule over the people, as well as to other nece&s;&s;ary qualifications. The directi|on of heaven in this ca&s;e is plain; "Thou &s;halt provide out of all the people, able men, &s;uch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetou&s;|ne&s;s; and place &s;uch over them." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exodus 18.21.</NOTE> Men of another character, men who will trifle with, and &s;acrifice, their own mo&s;t important inter|e&s;ts, will al&s;o &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of others, to &s;erve their own &s;ini&s;ter views and purpo&s;es.

It was long ago pro|phe&s;ied, by the great Monte&s;quieu, that "As all human things have an end, the &s;tate we are &s;peaking of (England) will lo&s;e its liber|ty, will peri&s;h. Have not Rome, Sparta, and Carthage peri&s;hed? It will peri&s;h, when the legi&s;lative power &s;hall be more corrupt than the executive." We may fear that this pro|phecy is near its accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>BE that as it may. While we are &s;uffering the lo&s;s of many valuable ble&s;&s;ings, we &s;hould not forget that, of the unmerited mercy of God, we &s;till are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a rich va|riety of ine&s;timable favors. Let us endeavor to make all &s;uitable returns of love, gratitude and obedience, to that Being, "from whom cometh down every good and perfect gift," herefor; while, at the &s;ame time, we are con|&s;tantly looking to God, by prayer, for the re|moval of his judgments, under which the land groaneth, for the averting tho&s;e evils which may be impending, and for the be&s;tow|ment of every ble&s;&s;ing, "that he would re|member us, with the favor he beareth unto his people, and vi&s;it us with his &s;alvation, that we may &s;ee the good of his cho&s;en, that we may

rejoice in the gladne&s;s of his nation, and that we may glory with his inheritance." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 106.4, 5.</NOTE> Let us carefully follow the direction of the P&s;al|mi&s;t. "Fret not thy&s;elf becau&s;e of evil doers, neither be thou envious again&s;t the workers of iniquity: For they &s;hall &s;oon be cut down like the gra&s;s, and wither as the green herb. Tru&s;t in the Lord <HI>and do good</HI>; &s;o &s;halt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou &s;halt be fed. Delight thy&s;elf al&s;o in the Lord; and he &s;hall give thee the de&s;ires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the Lord: Tru&s;t al&s;o in Him, and he &s;hall bring it to pa&s;s. And he &s;hall bring forth thy righteou&s;ne&s;s as the light, and thy judgment as the noon-day. Re&s;t in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him: Fret not thy&s;elf becau&s;e of him who pro&s;pereth in his way, becau&s;e of the man who bringeth wick|ed devices to pa&s;s. Cea&s;e from anger, and for&s;ake wrath: Fret not thy&s;elf in any wi&s;e to do evil. For evil doers &s;hall be cut off: But tho&s;e that wait upon the Lord they &s;hall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked &s;hall not be: Yea, thou &s;halt dili|gently con&s;ider his place, and it &s;hall not be. But the meek &s;hall inherit the earth; and &s;hall delight them&s;elves in the abundance of peace." <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 37.1&mdash;11.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="013769_0069_0F91ACE6C2B0E760">TO conclude. While &s;truggling for deli|verance from arbitrary human power, and for civil liberty, let us remember that we are in voluntary &s;lavery under the u&s;urped dominion of lu&s;t over rea&s;on, and let us exert our&s;elves for deliverance from the bondage of corrupti|on, and that we may be vindicated "into the glorious liberty of the children of God." We mu&s;t not expect refined happine&s;s in this pre|&s;ent <HI>evil</HI> world. Infinite wi&s;dom &s;ees meet to exerci&s;e us with various trials in this &s;tate, that we may be di&s;engaged from a too fond pur|&s;uit of worldly felicity, and be excited to &s;eek tho&s;e things which are above. There is a bet|ter country before us, even an heavenly; be this the main object of our de&s;ires, pur&s;uit and endeavors. Let us manife&s;t, by all our life and conver&s;ation, that we are &s;eeking a city which is to come, which hath foundations, who&s;e builder and maker is God. In a little time death will tran&s;late us to another world, and "&s;eeing we look for <HI>this,</HI> let us be dili|gent that we may be found of our Judge in peace, without &s;pot, and blamele&s;s;" and then we &s;hall be forever happy in that &s;tate where "the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and we &s;hall no more hear the voice of the oppre&s;&s;or." There an eternal circle of uninterrupted hap|pine&s;s, large as our wi&s;hes, awaits us, to which we &s;hall, at length, be admitted, of the mercy of God, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, our Lord. AMEN!</P>
