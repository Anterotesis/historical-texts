<Q>FOR Mordecai the Jew, was next unto King Aha&s;u|erus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, &s;eeking the wealth of his people, and &s;peaking peace to all his &s;eed.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE words now read, pre&s;ent to our view, true patrioti&s;m, and public happine&s;s in the clo&s;e&s;t connection therewith; not in theory, but really exi&s;tent, in the cha|racter and admini&s;tration of Mordecai the Jew, under the king Aha&s;uerus.</P>
<P>LONG had the jews enjoyed peace and quiet, du|ring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive reigns of &s;everal Per&s;ian princes, who
<PB N="6" REF="011062_0005_0F854BE8228F0008">
were as famous for their moderation, as for the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es of their arms, the extent of their empire, or the grandeur of their courts: when Haman, a de&s;cen|dant of Agag, a former devoted king of the curs'd Amalekites, by the united influence, of his riches, and his craft, became the favourite of the king A|ha&s;uerus, and was promoted to be prime mini&s;ter of &s;tate.</P>
<P>AMIDST all his glory, he had the mortification, to be treated with a con&s;cientious neglect, and &s;corn, by Mordecai a Jew; who&s;e highe&s;t employment, was that of a porter to the king's palace. This fill'd the haugh|ty brea&s;t of Haman with the utmo&s;t indignation, and rais'd the old national enmity, of the Amalekite, again&s;t the Jew to its highe&s;t pitch.</P>
<P>NOT contented therefore, with the de&s;truction of Mordecai, and &s;corning to reak his revenge on a &s;ingle object, and of &s;o low a character; he plots the utter extirpation of the Jews from the empire, to gratify his proud and malicious re&s;entments: and abu&s;ing the confidence of his ma&s;ter, he obtain'd a decree for that purpo&s;e; which according to the laws of the empire, was irrever&s;ible.</P>
<P>SECURE of carrying his point, he plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the pro&s;pect of the cruel ma&s;&s;acre de&s;igned. But it was not long before his cur&s;ed plot was de|feated by the prudence and application of Mordecai, and his zeal for the &s;afety and happine&s;s of his people; together with the addre&s;s and influence of
<PB N="7" REF="011062_0006_0F854BE8E2846530">
E&s;ther his kin&s;woman, whom he had educated as his child and who&s;e tender mind he had formed, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of pure religion, and &s;incere benevolence to public u&s;efulne&s;s; and who by her graceful and ver|tuous conduct, as well as &s;ingular beauty, had gained the favor of her prince, and was become his queen.</P>
<P>THE vertue of Mordecai had &s;hone with an agre|able lu&s;tre in private life, and in the lower offices of &s;ervice to his ma&s;ter; who had received a &s;pecial proof of his loyalty and fidelity, in the di&s;covery of a trea&s;onable de&s;ign again&s;t his life. But now Pro|vidence was plea&s;ed on occa&s;ion of Haman's villany, to call him forth to more public and exten&s;ive u&s;eful|ne&s;s; and give him an opportunity to di&s;play his capacity and his vertue in an exalted &s;tation.</P>
<P>IN Haman we &s;ee the tyrant in real life; no &s;ooner rai&s;ed to power, than his &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and ambition, cruelty and revenge bur&s;t forth, in &s;pite of rea&s;on, honor and con&s;cience, and in defiance of the mo&s;t venerable rights, and the claims of equity and mercy; and he di&s;po&s;es of the liberty, property and lives of thou&s;ands, at plea&s;ure, and in a wantonne&s;s of rage beyond de&s;cription. But the vengeance of heaven &s;oon awoke to vindicate his people's wrongs; and he fell a victim thereto, and to the ju&s;t re&s;entments of his abu&s;ed prince; before whom his villany was expo&s;ed, by the prudence of the queen, under the direction of Mordecai. Thus he dropped into oblivion, like other tyrants, unregretted and his memory rots.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="011062_0007_0F854BE9A30A0050">
How &s;trong, and beautiful is the contra&s;t; when on the other hand we view the character of Mordecai! his capacity, wi&s;dom, and vertue appear amiable in private, but much more in public life: in his mo&s;t elevated &s;tation he is far from being elated in his mind above it; and notwith&s;tanding all the temptati|ons to avarice and ambition, cruelty and revenge, attending &s;o great a tran&s;ition and change, in his outward circum&s;tances, the true patriot &s;hines with di&s;tingui&s;hing lu&s;tre, and di&s;covers a greatne&s;s of &s;oul, ri&s;ing &s;uperior to all the influence of private and &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions. And the form of government, among the Per&s;ians, being monarchial, and become quite de&s;potic, rendered the prudence, moderation and vertue of Mordecai the more con&s;picuous, and the more worthy of imitation.</P>
<P>BUT whatever forms of government different nations have been led into, from their differing genius and circum&s;tances, by which they have con&s;ented to give up their natural rights, into the hands of one or more, it has been done in tru&s;t only: the &s;ole original end and de&s;ign of which, is therefore the public happine&s;s. And perhaps each form is equally agre|able to the will of God, and capable of &s;ecuring this great de&s;ign, provided it falls into the hands of a wi&s;e and vertuous admini&s;tration; whereof methinks the in&s;tance of Mordecai is no &s;mall proof. Yet that form of government, in which the liberty, property and life of the &s;ubject, hath the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ecurity, mu&s;t be the mo&s;t eligible, as it is the mo&s;t perfect.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="011062_0008_0F854BEC293BB5B8">
SUCH is the happy con&s;titution of Britain and her Colonies, which God long pre&s;erve, again&s;t the &s;ecret machinations and open attempts of its enemies, do|me&s;tic and foreign, who envy <HI>her,</HI> but e&s;pecially <HI>their</HI> encrea&s;ing greatne&s;s, pro&s;perity, and felicity.</P>
<P>THE character of a good ruler is to be drawn; and the qualifications for this office and tru&s;t, are to be determined, by the great end of government, the public good: and this is the &s;tandard, according to which, rulers are to form them&s;elves to u&s;efulne&s;s, in their advanced &s;tations. And the influence of &s;uch a character and conduct, will be great, to &s;ecure the affection and loyalty of the &s;ubject; and to promote the felicity of the whole. My text very naturally leads us into, and confirms us in this thought.</P>
<P>SUCH was the character of Mordecai; who there|fore, in the exerci&s;e of his high authority, not only rendered him&s;elf grateful to his prince; but perfectly ingratiated him&s;elf with his people; while he &s;teadily pur&s;ued, this great end of government, the public weal. A character, and conduct like his, can hardly fail of commanding all that re&s;pect and obedience, which is a ruler's due.</P>
<P>MORDECAI was great with the king, being advan|ced to the highe&s;t po&s;t of government under him; and one he delighted to honour. He was equally great with the people; and by gaining their affections, he &s;ecured their allegiance to their prince, and their obedience to his own admini&s;tration. The rea&s;on of
<PB N="10" REF="011062_0009_0F854BECA0882BB8">
all this greatne&s;s of Mordecai, was the greatne&s;s of his own mind, and the excellency of his government; the whole whereof, was directed to the common good, and under which, the people felt them&s;elves ea&s;y, &s;afe, and happy. <HI>For Mordecai the Jew, was next unto king Aha&s;uerus, and great among the Jews, and accep|ted of the multitude of his brethren, &s;eeking the wealth of his people, and &s;peaking peace to all his &s;eed.</HI></P>
<P>To decypher the character of a good ruler, from this example; and to &s;hew its force, and influence to &s;ecure the confidence, re&s;pect and obedience of the &s;ubject, &s;hall be my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>FIRST then,</P>
<P>I SHALL take &s;ome account of the character of a good ruler, as drawn in the text.</P>
<P>As the great end of civil government is the public good, capacity, and genius, wi&s;dom, and prudence, courage and re&s;olution, religion, and vertue, and public &s;pirit, are the mo&s;t obvious qualifications of a good ruler, and the mo&s;t &s;triking parts of his character, and all together form the true patriot. Such a one was Mordecai; and &s;uch civil rulers ought ever to be, in who&s;e hands the whole, or the principal con|cerns of government are betru&s;ted.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, Capacity and genius is nece&s;&s;ary to the character of a good ruler.</P>
<P>WITHOUT this, Mordecai could never have ro&s;e to that eminency of &s;tation, he was honoured with;
<PB N="11" REF="011062_0010_0F854BEEEF32DAF0">
nor in any mea&s;ure, have &s;upported the dignity of it; nor an&s;wered the de&s;igns of his elevation. And how can the ends of government be attained, without a genius, and capacity &s;uited thereto? when the lowe&s;t office in life can never be well di&s;charged, without talents an&s;werable to its nature, and de&s;ign. Men's abilities, mu&s;t be as exten&s;ive as their authority, to pre&s;erve the dignity, and &s;ecure the advantages of government. Jethro, Mo&s;es's father-in-law, a man ver&s;ed in politics, gives Mo&s;es that advice, in the choice of magi&s;trates, to which heaven fixed its appro|bation, (viz.) that they be able men, (i. e.) men of &s;trength of genius, and that under&s;tand public bu|&s;ine&s;s; as Mo&s;es afterwards, explains it; when he directs the people, to take wi&s;e men, and men of under&s;tanding, known among their tribes, to be rulers over them. And it was the commendation, of the heads of I&s;&s;achar, that they were, men that had un|der&s;tanding of the times, to know what I&s;rael ought to do.</P>
<P>A NATURAL clearne&s;s, and coolne&s;s of thought, with a turn of mind towards government, improved by the &s;tudy of men and books, and judicious ob&s;er|vation, will render a man capable of bu&s;ine&s;s, in a good degree: And &s;o e&s;&s;ential is &s;uch a capacity and genius, that nothing can &s;upply the defect thereof.</P>
<P>WHAT, but a perpetual &s;eries of blunders, and the mo&s;t di&s;mal confu&s;ion, as the con&s;equence thereof, can be expected, from the admini&s;tration of weak headed, &s;hort &s;ighted, muddy brained men? who, &s;o
<PB N="12" REF="011062_0011_0F854BEFBAF9A030">
far from meriting the character of good rulers, are, for the mo&s;t part, the plagues of &s;ociety, and the bane of public felicity; while their weak minds, and not le&s;s vain, commonly grow giddy with their ad|vancement; and make them unwilling to be checked, or to take the advice of wi&s;er men than them&s;elves. And, be it, that the heart of a ruler de&s;titute of ca|pacity, is hone&s;t; yet he knows not where the true intere&s;t of the community lies, nor by what mea&s;ures to pur&s;ue, and promote it: his benevolent de&s;igns therefore, prove abortive, for want of capacity to ex|ecute them to advantage. Be&s;ides, from a defect of under&s;tanding, equal to his tru&s;t, he is expo&s;ed to the intrigues of de&s;igning men, and to be made the tool of a party, or of &s;ome fawning para&s;ite, or cor|rupt mini&s;ter of &s;tate, who&s;e intere&s;ted views, and lu&s;t of power, can be gratified with nothing le&s;s, than the ruin of thou&s;ands. How ju&s;t, then is that exclamation of Solomon? Wo unto thee, oh land, when thy king is a child!</P>
<P>ON the other hand, a &s;tate reduced to the brink of ruin, by prodigality and di&s;&s;ipation, or by &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s and ambition, with its con&s;tant attendants, fac|tion and party &s;pirit; has been often &s;aved, by a &s;ingle man, in public place; and re&s;cued from the de&s;truc|tion that vi&s;ibly impended over it. This, Solomon long &s;ince ob&s;erved; and therefore &s;ays, for the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of a land, many are the princes thereof; but by a man of under&s;tanding and knowledge, the &s;tate &s;hall be prolonged.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="011062_0012_0F854BF06AB19890">
THE objects that are to employ the thoughts and &s;tudy of magi&s;trates, require a more than common extent of capacity, and &s;trength of genius: &s;uch are the natural and &s;ocial rights of mankind; the hi&s;tory and laws of nature and nations; the hi&s;tory and municipal con&s;titutions of their own country; the genius and intere&s;ts thereof; their connections with, or dangers from their neighbours; the methods of be&s;t increa&s;ing the numbers and wealth of the &s;ub|jects; and the laws which will render their liberties more &s;ecure, and their nece&s;&s;ary burthens more ea&s;y and equal; encourage their trade, hu&s;bandry and ma|nufactures; promote vertue and religion, and &s;uppre&s;s vice of every kind, and in every character. What exten&s;ive capacities? What penetration and clearne&s;s of thought, and &s;oundne&s;s of judgment, are requi&s;ite in this view, to render a magi&s;trate u&s;eful, and a&s;tate happy?</P>
<P>NOR is it every man of under&s;tanding, that is fit for a &s;tate&s;man. A man may have a noble genius for, and make va&s;t improvements in various branches of &s;cience, or mechanic knowledge, and be thoroughly acquainted with the <HI>belles lettres,</HI> who has no under|&s;tanding of government and politics, nor any genius for the law, or &s;ufficient acquaintance with humane nature in general, or the particular con&s;titution, and circum&s;tances of the people he is to govern: and it is impo&s;&s;ible, &s;uch a man &s;hould be a good ruler; however he may be a man of wit or learning, and an hone&s;t chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, in this frail and pa&s;&s;ing &s;tate, in which
<PB N="14" REF="011062_0013_0F854BF137ED69D0">
we have but little opportunity, for our own experi|ence to &s;erve us; there is need of the experience of pa&s;t ages; and of a ju&s;t di&s;cerning, to notice and correct former mi&s;takes and errors; and to improve advanta|ges obtained, and happy precedents, to promote not only the pre&s;ent, but the future felicity of the com|mon wealth; which a good ruler will ever keep in view.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Wi&s;dom and prudence is not le&s;s ne|ce&s;&s;ary to form the character of a good ruler, than capacity and genius. Solomon, deeply &s;en&s;ible of the importance of &s;uch a qualification, made the acquire|ment of it, the great object of his attention; and the principal matter of his prayer to heaven, when he fir&s;t entered on his government. Heaven heard, and an|&s;wered with a rich &s;upply of this, and every other needful gift and ble&s;&s;ing. How con&s;picuous, was the wi&s;dom of Mordecai, in the mea&s;ures he took to defeat the cruel and bloody de&s;igns of Haman upon the Jews! By which he turned the mi&s;chief on the heads of their enemies, and procured &s;afety for them, to his everla&s;ting honour.</P>
<P>THERE are a variety of circum&s;tances, that may attend a community; which expo&s;e it to the mo&s;t imminent hazards, be&s;ides the con&s;tant and ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of government, and occa&s;ions of the &s;tate; which call for &s;ingular mea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and prudence, to find out expedients, and fix upon the be&s;t means, for its relief: and if in &s;uch an important cri&s;is, rulers are de&s;titute of wi&s;dom, adequate to the
<PB N="15" REF="011062_0014_0F854BF1F1548270">
demands and expectations of the &s;tate; its ruin is like to en&s;ue, and will lie under their hands. And where parties and factions prevail, either through ignorance, or de&s;ign, as too often happens; it will require the mo&s;t prudent conduct, to &s;ilence murmurs, &s;top the mouth of faction, and re&s;tore peace and tranquility. Nor will a le&s;s degree of prudence &s;erve to remove the mi&s;takes, or prejudices, and obviate the de&s;igns of tho&s;e who have it in their power to oppre&s;s and injure the community.</P>
<P>SOME men have a peculiar talent this way; and to find out the mo&s;t happy expedients, in every ca&s;e of public danger, and to pur&s;ue them with the greate&s;t advantage, which mu&s;t be a di&s;tingui&s;hing ornament in their character as rulers. Whereas others, who&s;e prudence may be &s;ufficient to conduct the concerns of the public in a calm, are wholly nonplu&s;h'd in every &s;pecial emergency and difficulty, and appear quite unequal to the trials they are called to encounter: they yield to them, &s;ink under them, and leave all things to their own cour&s;e; which nece&s;&s;arily involves the &s;tate in the utmo&s;t di&s;order and confu&s;ion, and endangers the total &s;ubver&s;ion of government. Sound wi&s;dom in a ruler is the medium between tempori|zing caution, and ra&s;h precipitancy; each alike dan|gerous, and often fatal. And that ruler only, comes up to the character in the text, who hath &s;uch a greatne&s;s of mind, as to ri&s;e above every difficulty and danger, in the mo&s;t tempe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;on and
<PB N="16" REF="011062_0015_0F854BF2ABC2ED38">
threatning cri&s;is: and while he keeps the full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf, calmly con&s;ults and &s;teadily pur&s;ues tho&s;e mea&s;ures which have the mo&s;t direct tendency to prevent the impending ruin; or at lea&s;t to le&s;&s;en and mitigate the evils dreaded, and render them le&s;s pernicious.</P>
<P>I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Courage and re&s;olution are very e&s;&s;ential to the character of a good ruler.</P>
<P>How firm and &s;teady was Mordecai, under the mo&s;t threatning a&s;pects, and when nothing le&s;s than the total extirpation, and ruin of his people was plot|ted and decreed! In&s;tead of &s;inking under the pro&s;pects of this dreadful fate; he ri&s;es, not to meet it undaunted, which is often but the fal&s;e image of cour|age; and properly &s;tiled fool-hardine&s;s, and pre&s;ump|tion: but to obviate, and ward it off, and happily &s;ucceeds. Similar dangers call for &s;imilar prudence, application and re&s;olution.</P>
<P>EVERY community lies expo&s;ed in &s;ome degree to foreign enemies and inte&s;tine feuds; and if in any re|&s;pects, dependant, to oppre&s;&s;ion from tho&s;e, on whom they are &s;o, thro' mi&s;taken policy, or the influence of &s;uch, as have a lu&s;t for arbitrary power. Nor is any &s;tate &s;o wholly free from crafty de&s;igning men, enemies of order and government, or of the liberties of their country; as not in certain circum&s;tances to endanger, at lea&s;t its peace, if not its entire &s;ubver&s;ion, and ruin. And the follies of &s;ome, and vices of others, not &s;eldom, reduce it to the brink of de&s;truction. In the&s;e, and
<PB N="17" REF="011062_0016_0F854BF3751176E8">
the like dangers, as well as when rulers are vilified, and reproached for their zeal and fidelity in their office; courage and &s;teadine&s;s is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity. And a man that dare not confront, dome&s;tic or foreign enemies; a&s;&s;ert the dignity of his &s;tation, and the con&s;titutional rights belonging to it, again&s;t factious demagogues; or the ju&s;t, rea&s;onable, and con&s;titutional liberties of the people, again&s;t the encroachments of arbitrary power; that meanly flys his po&s;t, or betrays his tru&s;t, on threat|ning appearances; that &s;neaks before the tow'ring menaces of vice, or that &s;inks under the reproaches ca&s;t upon him for his fidelity:&mdash;The man, in &s;hort, that dares not do his duty in the face of danger, is &s;urely not fit to be a ruler, nor can po&s;&s;ibly be a good one.</P>
<P>THE fear of man, brings a &s;nare, to a timerous mind; and every little danger, is aggravated, and enhanced, by a frightful fancy, and imagination: which bya&s;&s;es the judgment, and too often bribes the con&s;cience. And who doth not &s;ee this to be &s;ufficient to di&s;qualify a man for being a ruler?</P>
<P>WHEN a &s;tate is &s;unk never &s;o low, to de&s;pair of its emerging, and flouri&s;hing again, prevents, or ener|vates all endeavours for its relief; and tends to ha&s;ten and compleat its de&s;truction. And to be irre&s;olute, is almo&s;t as fatal, as to de&s;pair. A ruler of &s;uch a tim|orous make, mu&s;t needs be hurried by tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which commonly precipitate the ruin he fears, and which he might with re&s;olution have prevented. Calm con&s;ideration is interrupted, tho' ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="18" REF="011062_0017_0F854BF421B32AB0">
to guide the judgment, and fix the mind, in the choice, and pur&s;uit, of the be&s;t, or only means of &s;afety and deliverance.</P>
<P>IN every dangerous cri&s;is of the &s;tate then, happy is the people that have rulers of capacity and wi&s;dom, to di&s;cern, and of courage and firmne&s;s, to pur&s;ue tho&s;e mea&s;ures, from which, under God, they may hope for a redre&s;s of grievances, and a removal of tho&s;e evils, that threaten their ruin.</P>

<P>FOURTHLY, Religion and vertue are e&s;&s;ential to the character of a good ruler.</P>
<P>THERE is not a &s;ingle character of a good ruler, in the bible, in which religion and vertue is not a principal part of it. This was a &s;triking part of Mordecai's character, in private life: and when he left his private &s;tation, for the highe&s;t po&s;t in go|vernment, next the king, he left not his religion behind him. And it is to be pre&s;umed, that when a man has acquired a religious character, in private, he will &s;upport the &s;ame in public life. Yet it &s;ometimes falls out otherwi&s;e, through the frailty of human nature, and the force of tho&s;e temptations, that attend a public &s;tation.</P>
<P>WHERE men have no &s;ettled principle of vertuous conduct, we may rea&s;onably expect it will always be thus. And a man de&s;titute of integrity and principle, will be regardle&s;s of the great ends of government, and make it his bu&s;ine&s;s, rather to

indulge his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e and plea&s;ures, his avarice or ambi|tion; than to di&s;charge the duties of his po&s;t. In this ca&s;e, men's capacity and genius, their wi&s;dom and courage, will be pro&s;tituted to their &s;elfi&s;h and &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns; or to the humours and lu&s;ts of others, on whom they are dependant. They often become venal, and by their examples teach others to be &s;o: and &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts and liberties of the com|munity, to gratify their private pa&s;&s;ions, and to pro|mote their per&s;onal advantage: and u&s;e all their policy and influence, to make tho&s;e they mo&s;t abu&s;e, in&s;en&s;ible of the wrongs done them, or to compel them to bear them; and to make others the tools of their avarice and ambition, and the in&s;truments of their oppre&s;&s;ion and villainy. An inward principle of religion is therefore highly nece&s;&s;ary in a ruler: for he that ruleth over men, mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God. And to fear God, and hate covetou&s;ne&s;s, are principal qualifications of the good ruler. Such a principle will be of u&s;e, to influence all the public mea&s;ures; and to &s;ecure tho&s;e divine aids and &s;miles, without which the arduous and important tru&s;t, a&s;&s;igned to rulers, can never be duly, or &s;ucce&s;sfully di&s;charged.</P>
<P>THIS principle is of a divine nature and original; and a man informed and actuated thereby, will have a mo&s;t &s;acred veneration for the Deity, will place his confidence in him, will labour to be conformed to him in a godlike temper and di&s;po&s;ition; and
<PB N="20" REF="011062_0019_0F854BF5AC67C858">
have an inviolable regard to his glory and intere&s;t, his will and law. This principle will in a very &s;pecial manner, lead a ruler into a dependance on, and conformity to a glorious Chri&s;t; and to exhibit that righteou&s;ne&s;s and mercy, that truth, meekne&s;s, and gentlene&s;s, which are &s;o con&s;picuous in the admini&s;tration of his kingdom. It will al&s;o give force and energy to all the motives the go&s;pel &s;ug|ge&s;ts, to a faithful di&s;charge of the duties of his &s;tation; and bear them in on his mind in their full weight and importance. It will &s;ubdue his &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ubordinate his private, to the public intere&s;ts: and while it enlarges the mind, and enobles the &s;pirit, will divert him from every low, mean, and criminal view and pur&s;uit; and engage him to devote his time and talents, with &s;teady zeal, application, and fidelity to the public good, and to deny him&s;elf in every re&s;pect to promote it.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed, no principles, but tho&s;e of chri&s;tianity, that are &s;ufficient to make a man truly great; how much &s;oever &s;ome of the heathen have been admired for their &s;eeming greatne&s;s, and how much &s;oever they have been propo&s;ed to imitation. Nor do I conceive a man truly great, who, out of vain glory, and worldly views, is lead to do &s;ome great things: nay, that Roman &s;pirit, &s;o often com|mended and extolled, which appears to be influenced only by the pro&s;pect of fame, riches, honours, and authority; which not only cea&s;ed to exert it&s;elf for
<PB N="21" REF="011062_0020_0F854BF662ADE248">
the public good, when it met with ingratitude and inju&s;tice, neglect and contempt, &s;uffering and reproach; but &s;hrank, and &s;hrivel'd up into a mean, da&s;tardly fear, or &s;elf-love, that made them run upon the &s;word, as their only refuge and relief; is &s;o far from de&s;erving the encomi|ums given it, that chri&s;tians &s;hould be rather cautioned again&s;t it, and taught to treat it with the contempt and abhorrence it de&s;erves. 'Tis the chri&s;tian religion only, that in&s;pires the mind with fortitude and gran|deur, to &s;uffer in a noble cau&s;e, and not ingloriou&s;ly de&s;ert it; nay, voluntarily to tender its &s;ervices, when the &s;tate needs them, or is in danger. The po&s;t of honour, is not therefore, always, a private &s;tation, tho' &s;ometimes, it may &s;o happen.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible, that a natural genero&s;ity of mind; the power of con&s;cience in men de&s;titute of a principle of true religion; nay even ambition, and intere&s;ted views, may be improved by heaven, to render &s;ome men u&s;eful to the public; and they may di&s;charge their tru&s;t to general &s;atisfaction and applau&s;e. But if a ruler acting on no higher principles, may merit the approba|tion of the public; how much more will &s;uch de&s;erve it, who act on the noble and exalted principles of chri&s;|tianity?</P>
<P>WE have indeed but little &s;ecurity for the good conduct of rulers that are de&s;titute of religion, or for the divine &s;miles on their admini&s;tration. Whereas we have the &s;tronge&s;t grounds to hope for both, if they are men of &s;incere vertue.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="011062_0021_0F854BF72301BB20">
RELIGION is venerable, in the e&s;teem of all, but tho&s;e who have abandoned them&s;elves to debauchery and villainy, and who&s;e con&s;ciences are perfectly &s;eared, and callous: hence &s;ome men, to &s;erve a low, &s;elfi&s;h, and party de&s;ign, put on a ma&s;k of religion, that they may be re&s;pectable, and the ea&s;ier accompli&s;h their de&s;igns. But if known, they ought to be the objects of the greate&s;t contempt and abhorrence: nor is it unu&s;ual, that they betray them&s;elves, and act out their true prin|ciples, in &s;o open a manner, as to di&s;cover their de|te&s;table hypocri&s;y. It is ever to be expected, that he that is fal&s;e to his God, will be unfaithful to men; nor is &s;uch a man, when known, to be tru&s;ted in the lower offices of life; and much le&s;s in the high &s;tations of government. Nor can any thing be more prepo&s;te|rous and ab&s;urd, than to commit our properties, life, and liberties, to the care of a man, that pretends to no religion, or that evidences by his conver&s;ation, that he has none: for he that has no reverence for the Deity, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any regard for moral obligations, nor to be in any degree influenced thereby; and he that will &s;acrifice his own mo&s;t valuable, yea eternal intere&s;ts, to his vicious inclinations, will not fail to &s;acrifice tho&s;e of the public (when they come in competition) to the &s;ame ruling pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Once more, Fifthly,</P>
<P>PUBLIC &s;pirit is an e&s;&s;ential qualification of a good ruler, and is in&s;eparable from his character.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="011062_0022_0F854BF7E1BA3760">
THE ruler's office is for the public good, and if his &s;pirit corre&s;ponds not with the de&s;ign of his office, he is far from being a benefactor or a ble&s;&s;ing: nor can any &s;tate flouri&s;h, where public &s;pirit is not the cha|racteri&s;tic of its rulers. This is a &s;pirit of true benevo|lence, is therefore founded in, or rather a branch of true religion. The love of our neighbour &s;prings from the love of God, as its true original and &s;ource; it is there|fore in&s;eparably connected with it. This was the &s;pirit of Mordecai, in whom benevolence to his brethren, was as con&s;picuous and evident, as his love to God.</P>
<P>GENEROSITY and kindne&s;s, conde&s;cen&s;ion and com|plai&s;ance, were in him, the true marks of it. A man of this &s;pirit, will ever feel for the public, as well as for him&s;elf; and the benign influences of his heart, will diffu&s;e them&s;elves, in the mo&s;t beneficial and happy effects to thou&s;ands. He con&s;iders him&s;elf as the father of the people, when in the mo&s;t exalted &s;tation&punc; nor di&s;dains to treat them as brethren. He views all his powers and betru&s;tments, as committed to him by the great parent of the univer&s;e, for the good of the whole; and he &s;leeps and wakes for the common benefit. An equal and ardent love of the whole, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his brea&s;t, and excites him to tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which wi&s;dom and vertue dictate, whereby the whole may be made ea&s;y, &s;afe, and happy. He knows no di&s;tinction of rich and poor, noble or ignoble, friends or foes; &s;o as to avoid any particular acts of benevolence, which may promote the welfare of each: nor will the mo&s;t un|grateful

returns, for his di&s;intere&s;ted good will, cau&s;e him to cea&s;e from the offices of kindne&s;s. His heart will be intent upon the public &s;afety and felicity, ever his delight and joy; and to ward off dangers, and remedy evils; while he deeply regrets tho&s;e he can|not heal, and the mi&s;chiefs he cannot prevent.</P>
<P>WHATEVER is u&s;eful or beneficial to &s;ociety, will have his &s;teady attention. Agriculture will be en|couraged, till the wilderne&s;s become a fruitful field, and the de&s;art blo&s;&s;om as the ro&s;e. Trade &s;o nearly connected therewith, as the &s;econd &s;ource of wealth, will be protected and cheri&s;hed, that his own com|munity may derive riches and plenty from other parts of the globe, as well as their own. Liberty, next to religion, the darling of a generous mind, will be guarded with the mo&s;t tender and watchful care. Inju&s;tice and immorality, di&s;&s;ipation and idlene&s;s, that ever weaken the &s;inews of the common wealth, will be frowned upon, and properly puni&s;hed; and the contrary vertues &s;upported, and encouraged, with a view to the dignity of the &s;tate, and its importance with its neighbours; one of the mo&s;t probable means of its &s;afety, and peace. Arts and &s;ciences, under his countenance, and favourable au&s;pecies, will be culti|vated and flouri&s;h; and yield a plea&s;ing pro&s;pect, that wi&s;dom and knowledge will be the &s;tability of future times, as well as of the pre&s;ent. And above all, religion in its truth, and native &s;implicity and freedom, will be promoted, under a benevolent admini&s;tration,

by the be&s;t examples; and provided for, and defend|ed by &s;uch &s;alutary laws, as come within the province of the magi&s;trate; and this with a &s;pecial view <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o the divine favour and protection, without which no com|munity can long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and much le&s;s flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>SUCH are the exertions, and &s;uch will be the effects of true public &s;pirit; and with unwearied application will a ruler of this character, employ him&s;elf for the good of his fellow men, that are under his admini|&s;tration. While on the contrary, avarice or ambition, indolence or moro&s;ene&s;s, mark the character of the man de&s;titute hereof; and &s;peak him unfit, for any office of importance, in government.</P>
<P>HAVING thus drawn into view, &s;ome of the princi|pal parts of the character, of a good ruler, from the in&s;tance in the text, I &s;hall proceed to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The influence of &s;uch a character, well &s;upported, to &s;ecure the confidence, re&s;pect, and obedi|ence of &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>AFTER all that has been &s;aid in favour of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance to what is called the di|vine right of magi&s;tracy in general, or of kings in par|ticular; it will remain for ever true, that the doctrines of arbitrary power, and con&s;equently of &s;lavery, are not the maxims of prudence, rea&s;on, or revelation; and put into practice, tend to produce the mo&s;t fatal con|vul&s;ions in a &s;tate, unle&s;s ignorance, effeminacy, and corruption have prevailed to enervate mens &s;pirits, to debauch their rea&s;on, and &s;ink them into a &s;tupid in|&s;en&s;ibility, almo&s;t equal to that of the brutes.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="011062_0025_0F854BFA3181F728">
IN this ca&s;e, while the language of de&s;poti&s;m, in a proud u&s;urper of the rights of mankind, rai&s;ed to power by his own intrigues, or by the folly, or wick|edne&s;s of others, is to this purpo&s;e. <Q>I am ve&s;ted with &s;ufficient authority, to give law, and to demand unre&s;erved &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience; and have power in my hands to enforce it: he that fails therefore, may depend upon my &s;evere&s;t re&s;entments; and de|&s;truction &s;hall be the fate of the man that dares oppo&s;e me.</Q> The abject minds of &s;ubjects, lo&s;t to all vertue and honour, may tamely yield; and they may reply, All that thou ha&s;t &s;aid, we will do, and will be obedient: Yet, what confidence have &s;uch &s;ubjects in their magi&s;trate? How can they but entertain &s;e|cret jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions, equally de&s;tructive of veneration, and love, of tru&s;t, and cordial &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion? a &s;lavi&s;h dread, and brutal &s;ubjection, or that which is forced, and in&s;incere, is the mo&s;t that can be pretended to. As mutual confidence and affection, between rulers and people, cannot fail of being de&s;troyed by &s;uch ar|bitrary claims, &s;o the people will be as plea&s;ed to have it in their power, to put to death even a prince, as ever they were to rai&s;e him to the throne: nor need we a large acquaintance with humane nature, or the hi&s;tory of nations, to be convinced of this: our own nation will indeed furni&s;h us with proof hereof, the mo&s;t ample and &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>THAT the mo&s;t hearty confidence, re&s;pect and obe|dience, is the magi&s;trates due, perhaps, no one in the
<PB N="27" REF="011062_0026_0F854BFAF1DE4028">
&s;ober u&s;e of rea&s;on, will deny. But the mo&s;t likely, and the only rational, and &s;criptural way of gaining and &s;ecuring it, is for the magi&s;trate to exhibit the patriotic character, in its full extent; and as a father, to pur&s;ue the common good and happine&s;s of the &s;ubject. He that is thus, the mini&s;ter of God to men, for their good, in his ruling capacity, not only fills his po&s;t with dignity and honour, but has all advantages on his &s;ide, to &s;ecure the confidence, re&s;pect and obedience of tho&s;e he governs. For be&s;ides, the &s;olemn repeated in|junctions of divine revelation, to this purpo&s;e, let every &s;oul be &s;ubject to the higher powers; enforced by a motive, drawn from the great end of magi&s;tracy and government, the good of the whole; which, by the way evidently determines the extent as well as de&s;ign of it: as al&s;o, by a motive, drawn from the penal con&s;equences, of an oppugnation of lawful authority, in this world, and the future: I &s;ay, be&s;ides &s;uch injunctions, which have a peculiar weight and influ|ence on a people, not &s;unk in ignorance, and aban|doned to debauchery: there is &s;omething in this character it&s;elf, that peculiarly &s;trikes the mind, awes it to reverence, and engages it to love and obedi|ence. It is the image of God on a ruler, and com|mands a proportionable re&s;pect.</P>
<P>RULERS are called gods, with regard to their office; and if they act in character, they become amiable and venerable, for their divine vertues; in which their is a certain engaging &s;weetne&s;s and maje&s;ty, not to be
<PB N="28" REF="011062_0027_0F854BFBB3498440">
de&s;cribed, which immediately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the mind, and gains its approbation, and makes it revere and honour them, and take plea&s;ure in their commands, as it were by nece&s;&s;ity and con&s;traint. How acceptable was Mor|decai to his brethren! and how great the influence of his truly patriotic character and conduct, to &s;ecure all that confidence and affection, that reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which he could wi&s;h for! Nor is it without de&s;ign, that the penman of his hi&s;tory, remarks the happy influence of his admini&s;tration on the people. They felt them&s;elves ea&s;y, &s;afe, and happy under his government, and were fully confi|dent of his capacity and integrity, and entirely at his devotion.</P>
<P>BUT then, the principle of &s;elf-love alone, will engage men to that obedience to good rulers, by which their own happine&s;s may be promoted, and &s;ecured. They can feel the benign influences of a wi&s;e, righ|teous, and benevolent admini&s;tration; and without the labour of rea&s;oning, and reflection, they generally per|ceive them&s;elves to be &s;afe and happy, when they are &s;o. When people have this &s;en&s;e, and percep|tion, it cannot fail of producing tho&s;e returns of gra|titude and confidence, re&s;pect and obedience, which are a good magi&s;trate's due: or if under &s;ome par|ticular burthens, the wi&s;dom of rulers, &s;ees fit to lay upon them, a few, who&s;e views are narrow and con|tracted, complain and find fault; it will rarely be found that their unea&s;ine&s;s is la&s;ting, or grows up to any great degree of di&s;affection.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="011062_0028_0F854BFC8C737830">
THERE are indeed, in all &s;ocieties, &s;ome men, who&s;e minds are &s;o degenerate and ba&s;e, as not only, not to be &s;en&s;ible of the beauty and dignity of the patriot character, in rulers: but from ambitious, and intere&s;ted views, or an invidious and jealous di&s;|po&s;ition, are ever ready to find fault, and often be|come turbulent and re&s;tle&s;s. Such men are con&s;tantly on the watch for opportunities, from the unavoida|ble frailties, and mi&s;takes of the be&s;t rulers, to rai&s;e &s;ome colourable objection again&s;t them; and practice the meane&s;t arts to prejudice others. And while they pretend a great zeal for the public, cry out of dan|ger, unrea&s;onable burthens, prodigality, or unequal mea&s;ures; they too often prevail to rai&s;e parties and factions, to the di&s;turbance of the &s;tate. The bot|tom of all is, they, or their friends are out of place, and they have little or no pro&s;pect, under a wi&s;e and vertuous admini&s;tration, of &s;erving their &s;elfi&s;h de&s;igns. And no men more like to take exceptions again&s;t a good admini&s;tration, than tho&s;e who&s;e character is quite the rever&s;e of the true patriot.</P>
<P>BUT however &s;uch men, may practice, and pro&s;per a while, they commonly precipitate their own ruin: or the righteous judge of all, expo&s;es their vile in|trigues in open light, and they become the objects of univer&s;al contempt.</P>
<P>IN general, if mankind have not a quick &s;en&s;e of the excellency of true patrioti&s;m in a ruler; yet they know when they are well u&s;ed; they have &s;ome &s;en&s;e
<PB N="30" REF="011062_0029_0F854BFD313EC020">
and value for their con&s;titutional as well as natural rights, and can tell when they freely and fully enjoy them; and will not de&s;troy their own &s;afety and happine&s;s, by a contempt of, or oppugnation to that authority, which is the great means of &s;ecuring it.</P>
<P>IT is certain, the wi&s;er and better part of the com|munity, will have &s;uch grateful re&s;entments of the fatherly tenderne&s;s, and watchful care and fidelity of good rulers, as to engage all their intere&s;t and influ|ence, in &s;upport of their authority; and to lighten as much as po&s;&s;ible their burthens, by promoting the loyalty and affection of their fellow &s;ubjects. And if a civil admini&s;tration, be but tolerably good, ex|perience &s;hews, that tho&s;e in it, are honoured while they live, by the wi&s;e and vertuous; and their me|mory is rever'd long after they are dead: how much more, will this be the ca&s;e, where rulers an&s;wer the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of Mordecai, and approve them|&s;elves true patriots, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive view?</P>
<P>THE doctrines of arbitrary power, are therefore as u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant, as they are ab&s;urd and un|&s;criptural; in as much as, rulers have it in their power to &s;ecure all that confidence, re&s;pect, and obedience, from &s;ubjects, that is their due, or that they can ju&s;tly de&s;ire, in a way more ea&s;y and &s;afe. Let them only act up to, and &s;upport their proper character as mini&s;ters of God for good to the people; and they may be morally a&s;&s;ured, of their hearts and pur&s;|es, yea, of their lives when the &s;tate needs them.</P>

SUCH is the influence, which the patriotic charac|ter and conduct in rulers, will have on the minds of &s;ubjects, to &s;ecure their confidence, re&s;pect, and obedience.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e views, the wi&s;dom and duty of rulers, with the mo&s;t natural and effectual motives to enforce it, are plainly pointed out. And we have all rea&s;on, of thankfulne&s;s to heaven, that our rulers are men of this character.</P>
<P>NOR can a better acknowledgment be paid to his Honour, the Governor, with the honourable the De|puty-Governor, and A&s;&s;i&s;tants, (whom I would addre&s;s on this occa&s;ion) under who&s;e wi&s;e, vertuous and be|nevolent admini&s;tration, we have enjoyed much peace and quietne&s;s; than, in the name of this people, to expre&s;s our de&s;ires, and hopes, that you may be &s;till continued, in your important &s;tations, to exert your well known capacities, and &s;pirit, in watching for the liberty, peace, and happine&s;s of the community.

<P>YOU cannot be in&s;en&s;ible, honoured, and worthy &s;enators, of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es, many are involved in, by their own di&s;&s;ipation and prodigality; and what in|fluence this has had upon; and how much it has affected others, that have been more indu&s;trious and frugal.

<P>IN this mo&s;t critical and alarming &s;ituation, our eyes are to you, our honoured and worthy rulers, next to God, to exert your&s;elves as your wi&s;dom &s;hall judge mo&s;t loyal, decent, and proper to obtain a redre&s;s of our grievances.

<P>I SHALL not need, to recommend to your con&s;i|deration, the importance of frugality, and indu&s;try, among the inhabitants of this colony: nor will you fail to give all due encouragement thereto, as well as to our own manufactures. And &s;uffer me to add, that the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate we are in, on account of our ama|zing debts; the want of a &s;ufficient medium of trade; the uncommon multiplication of law-&s;uits, and &s;ingular protraction of their i&s;&s;ues, in the courts of ju&s;tice; and the a&s;toni&s;hing con&s;umption of &s;pirituous liquors,

are worthy of, and call for your attention. And the vi&s;ible growth and prevalence of vice, di&s;&s;ipation, and debauchery, demands at this day a more vigorous exer|tion of your&s;elves, to &s;uppre&s;s and di&s;countenance it. Learning, we doubt not, will ever have your patronage; and we hope, the College, in particular, will not be de&s;titute of all needful a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to attain in the mo&s;t happy and effectual manner, the great ends of its in|&s;titution.

<P>SUCH is the character the gentlemen of the &s;a|cred order, generally &s;u&s;tain among us, that I may with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;urance engage on their behalf, that they will not depart from the generous, loyal, and religious principles of the fathers of this country: but that they will &s;teadily, and with equal order, exert them&s;elves, in their place and &s;tation, to &s;upport the honour and dignity of government, and to enforce the duty of the &s;ubject, and cultivate loyalty, peace, and good order, with a love of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and the practice of every &s;ocial vertue. And e&s;pecially, that they will urge on men, the peculiar doctrines, important precepts, and engaging motives of the go&s;pel; with a view to promote true and vital religion, as not only the means of their private and per&s;onal happine&s;s; but as the alone &s;ure ba&s;is of public vertue, and felicity.</P>
<P>I MAY al&s;o fairly pre&s;ume, it will be the care of the wi&s;e and the vertuous, not to encrea&s;e the burthens of government: but on the contrary, to di&s;counte|nance unrea&s;onable jealou&s;ies, murmurs, and complaints; expo&s;e the low arts and intrigues of de&s;igning men, to de&s;erved reproach and contempt; and prevent as much as po&s;&s;ible, factions and parties: while at the &s;ame

time, with the firme&s;t union, and mo&s;t manly and chri&s;tian re&s;olution, they a&s;&s;ert and maintain their na|tural and con&s;titutional rights; and are ready to &s;pend their trea&s;ure and their blood, in the noble cau&s;e of civil and religious liberty.</P>
<P>AND methinks, every one capable of the lea&s;t reflec|tion or pro&s;pect, &s;hould unite in the mo&s;t vigorous endeavours, to promote peace and loyalty, vertue, oeco|nomy, and religion in the pre&s;ent dark and cloudy day.</P>
<P>IT would betray a want of gratitude to heaven, on this occa&s;ion, as well as a narrow contracted turn of thought, not to ob&s;erve the divine patronage of right and liberty in Britain, from its mo&s;t early times. Britain, mo&s;t highly favoured of God, in the pre&s;ervation of her civil and religious freedom, while mo&s;t of the neighbour nations, have been en&s;laved to de&s;potic power, and arbi|trary &s;way; and the tyranny of prelates, as well as princes. Let her rejoice herein, and learn &s;oberly and vertuou&s;ly to u&s;e both her power, and her liberty, which will thus be, as it has been, her glory and her &s;afety.</P>
<P>'TIS worthy of remark, that not all the changes, that have pa&s;&s;ed over her, have ever yielded an opportunity to her enemies, to deprive her of her darling liberty: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at times it has been greatly oppre&s;&s;ed, and in the utmo&s;t danger. The weakne&s;s and wickedne&s;s of her princes, and their coun&s;ellors, the trea&s;ons and rebelli|ons of her &s;ubjects, the inva&s;ions of foreigners, have often reduced her to the la&s;t extremity. But heaven has

&s;ea&s;onably interpo&s;ed, and by &s;ome &s;urpri&s;ing and un|expected turn, has made all their injurious attempts, &s;ub&s;ervient to fix her liberty on a more &s;olid ba&s;is, and to guard it with &s;tronger &s;ecurities. A plain intimation this, that God never gives men up to be &s;laves, till they loo&s;e their national vertue, and abandon them&s;elves to &s;lavery.</P>
<P>THE e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the imperial crown of Great-Britain, in the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Ha|nover has been a mo&s;t happy and effectual means, under God, of pre&s;erving the Briti&s;h rights and con&s;titution: while the princes thereof have nobly maintained the dignity of their &s;tation, by a &s;ober improvement of the prerogative, within its con&s;titutional limits, and a &s;teady aim to live and reign in the affections of their &s;ubjects. Never was religious and civil liberty more &s;ecure, loyalty more cordial, arts and &s;ciences better cultivated, trade more flouri&s;hing, dome&s;tic peace and tranquility more &s;table, or Britain more the pride of her &s;ons, or the envy and terror of her foes; than under their paternal and patriotic admini&s;tration. Her glory has been ri&s;ing, with growing lu&s;tre, to the mo&s;t exalted &s;ummit, in the age and reign of George the third, our lawful and mo&s;t gracious &s;overeign. Heaven grant it may be perpetua|ted, and &s;till (if po&s;&s;ible) increa&s;e: for, &s;o far are we from envying her, that her grandeur and happine&s;s is ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> boa&s;t, and our connections with, and con&s;titutional de|pendance on her, what we wi&s;h the mo&s;t la&s;ting perma|nency to.

WHAT thanks owe we to heaven, in &s;pecial, for our di&s;tingui&s;hing privileges, civil and religious! and that when they have been &s;o often threatned, deliverances have been &s;ea&s;onably granted! au&s;picious deliverances to Britain, as well as her American Colonies: alike intere&s;ted in the important cau&s;e of liberty, and the hap|py events by which it has been re&s;cued from its dangers, and amply &s;ecured.</P>
<P>NOR &s;hould we forget the noble patrons of liberty, on the other &s;ide the atlantic; who not long &s;ince, &s;o boldly e&s;pou&s;ed, and effectually pleaded its cau&s;e; as to obtain a repeal of the &s;tamp act: nor tho&s;e worthy patriots in America, who then, or more lately appeared in its defence; among whom the ingenious, generous, &s;en&s;ible, &s;pirited, and loyal FARMER, de&s;erves our pe|culiar notice and acknowledgments. May they all &s;till continue their benevolent efforts, in the important cau&s;e; and may their names be handed to po&s;terity, with the mo&s;t grateful &s;en&s;e of their friendly offices; and after a long &s;eries of the mo&s;t beneficent and exten&s;ive &s;ervices to their country, may they receive the rewards, that ever await &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, and public u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>

enjoyment of civil and religious liberty: which to &s;ecure, our fathers &s;pent the whole labour of their lives, with an amazing trea&s;ure, and many of them their blood. Here thought we, may we now &s;it, under our own vine, and fig-tree, and reap the fruit of our own and our fathers toil and expence, &s;ecure from the rage of the enemy, and from the tyranny of bigotted prelates, the capricious hu|mour of arbitrary mini&s;ters, and the power of lawle&s;s &s;way.

Here arts and &s;ciences, and every u&s;eful manufacture &s;hall flouri&s;h, and make continual advances towards perfection. Here religion &s;hall remain, and be pre|&s;erved undefiled, in the doctrines of faith, the duties of the chri&s;tian life, and that wor&s;hip of God, which is mo&s;t agreable to primitive evangelical &s;implicity: and from hence &s;hall be diffu&s;ed through unnumbered tribes of heathen, and bring them to the knowledge, profe&s;&s;ion, and obedience of the truth; and the de&s;art &s;hall blo&s;&s;om as the ro&s;e: and God, even our own God, &s;hall ble&s;s us, and we &s;hall &s;ee his &s;alvation.</P>

over our heads, and intercepts every plea&s;ing vi&s;ion and hope, and portends the mo&s;t in&s;upportable and fatal calamities. This has rou&s;ed the attention of the mo&s;t thoughtle&s;s, and filled the minds of all the friends of civil and religious liberty, with anxious &s;ollicitude; and engaged them to (at lea&s;t) a &s;eeming union and vigour, in promoting indu&s;try, oeconomy and manu|factures, as the great means of the &s;alvation of their country: which is truly prai&s;e-worthy. But methinks the conduct of E&s;ther and Mordecai, together with the Jews, under their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and when the proud and revengeful Haman had obtained a decree for their total extirpation; comes mo&s;t &s;trongly recommended, as a pattern and precedent; I do not &s;ay from a &s;imila|rity of circum&s;tances, &s;o much, as from the ju&s;tice and propriety of the thing in it&s;elf; and from the happy &s;ucce&s;s that attended it. I mean, that of religious fa&s;t|ing and prayer. This, to be &s;ure, in the pre&s;ent alarm|ing cri&s;is, cannot be improper for particular per&s;ons, families, &s;ocieties, or the public. And the experience we have often had of God's gracious readine&s;s to hear, and &s;ave us in our di&s;tre&s;&s;es; as well as the promi|&s;es of his word; together with the a&s;&s;urance, our rea&s;on mu&s;t give us, that without heaven's interpo&s;i|tion, and the continuance of the divine patronage of our rights and liberties, all our own efforts for relief will be vain; con&s;pire to engage us to apply to God in this way herefor.
