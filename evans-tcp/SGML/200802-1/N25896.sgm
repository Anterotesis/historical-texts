<P>ALL that is required of thee is impartiality. No man can boa&s;t of a greater attachment to America, than the writer of the following Letters. God has given him a &s;oul to di&s;dain tyranny from the womb, and its faculties have been exerted again&s;t de&s;po|ti&s;m ever &s;ince they were capable of action. His heart bleeds to &s;ee the remnant of &s;lavery, in a country which the <HI>Creator</HI> has con&s;ecrated to li|berty. He dreads an in&s;urrection of the negroes in the &s;outhern &s;tates as much as any man;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Jeffer&s;on's Notes.</NOTE> but he is confident a dreadful revolution mu&s;t &s;oon take place, unle&s;s the &s;laves are in&s;tructed and gradually emancipated. It is now in the power of America to ward off the blow, and e&s;cape the dreadful ca|ta&s;trophe: and if this publication &s;hould incline the hearts of any to alleviate the mi&s;eries of their fellow-men, the author has obtained his end.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. John Lawrence, South Quay, Virginia.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHOULD not trouble you with the following lines, was it not for the bad effect your pamphlet, in vindication of negro &s;lavery has had, on the minds of ignorant, weak and &s;elf-intere&s;ted men. Some in|deed are willing to &s;uppo&s;e it unan&s;werable, but I told the gentleman who favoured me with your pro|duction, that I thought I could an&s;wer all the argu|ments you advanced. He pledged me to do it. I pro|mi&s;ed. I perform; for,
<Q><L>What I can do, can do no hurt to try,</L>
<L>Since you &s;et up your te&s;t gain&s;t remedy:</L>
<L>He that of greate&s;t works is fini&s;her,</L>
<L>Oft does them by the weake&s;t mini&s;ter.</L>
<L>Oft expectation fails, and mo&s;t oft there&mdash;</L>
<L>Where mo&s;t it promi&s;es; and oft it hits</L>
<L>Where hope is colde&s;t, and de&s;pair mo&s;t &s;its.</L></Q></P>
<P>May the pre&s;ent conte&s;t between freedom and &s;la|very prove &s;uch. I am young and you are old&mdash;where|fore I &s;aid, Days &s;hould &s;peak, and multitude of years &s;hould teach wi&s;dom; but great men are not always wi&s;e; neither do all the aged under&s;tand judgment; therefore, I &s;aid, hearken to me, I al&s;o will &s;hew mine opinion, concerning <HI>&s;lavery.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="034442_0004_0FFDC8FEB78B7F68">
You begin by &s;aying, "that the Bible is the only rule of faith and practice." Granted, for Chri&s;tians; and it is probable the dei&s;ts after a few years experi|ence, will judge the New-Te&s;tament to contain the be&s;t rules of action.</P>
<P>Your a&s;&s;ertion, "that whatever has been as yet &s;aid in favour of the emancipation of &s;laves, has been drawn from rea&s;on, and the conduct of &s;ome of the United States," is a palpable error. Slavery has been preached again&s;t, both by Heathens and Chri&s;|tians, before the United States were known. Homer &s;aid, 2600 years ago,
<Q><L>Jove fix'd it certain, that whatever day</L>
<L>Makes man a &s;lave, takes half his worth away.</L></Q></P>
<P>As you &s;eem to di&s;card rea&s;on, I &s;hall endeavour to prove by the authority of &s;cripture (which is not con|trary, but always con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on) that even the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation condemns perpetual &s;lavery. Yes, &s;ir, I will produce a "Thus &s;aith the Lord," for the manumi&s;&s;ion of &s;laves.</P>
<P>I join with you mo&s;t cordially, in "wi&s;hing rigid di&s;putants for liberty, to read their Bibles more;" for its doctrines breathe a mo&s;t noble love of freedom, and a perfect hatred of tyranny.</P>
<P>When you wi&s;h the citizens of America to read the con&s;titutions of the &s;tates le&s;s, I mu&s;t wi&s;h you a good night; for if it &s;hould ever be the ca&s;e, gro&s;s darkne&s;s will cover the land, and &s;trange infatuation po&s;&s;es the people.</P>
<P>Thir&s;t after knowledge, religious and political, &s;hould be the fir&s;t trait in the character of republicans. The very e&s;&s;ence of their government, <HI>modus</HI> of exi&s;t|ence, and energy of action, depends on the knowledge and virtue of the citizens. The citizens of America &s;hould, therefore, read the con&s;titutions of the differ|ent &s;tates with attention; compare them together, and be emulous which &s;tate &s;hall form the be&s;t con&s;ti|tution, and enact the be&s;t laws, in order to render
<PB N="6" REF="034442_0005_0FFDC90052622570">
the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible happine&s;s to all their fellow crea|tures. The maxim of their legi&s;latures &s;hould be, "Nothing is done whil&s;t any thing remains to be done."</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t endeavour to &s;et you right with regard to that book called the Bible, which you take for granted &s;upports negro-&s;lavery, and that your treati&s;e makes it manife&s;t! Do you imagine, &s;ir, that the <HI>Bible</HI> is like Pope's Temple of Fame?</P>
<LG>
<L>Where various news he heard of love and &s;trife;</L>
<L>Of peace and war; health, &s;ickne&s;s death and life;</L>
<L>Of old mi&s;managements, taxations new;</L>
<L><HI>All neither wholly fal&s;e, nor wholly true.</HI></L>
<L>Around a thou&s;and winged wonders fly,</L>
<L>Born by the trumpet's bla&s;t, and &s;cattered thro' the &s;ky.</L>
<L>There at one pa&s;&s;age oft you might &s;urvey,</L>
<L>A lie and truth contending for the way;</L>
<L>And long 'twas doubtful, both &s;o clo&s;ely pent,</L>
<L>Which fir&s;t &s;hould i&s;&s;ue through the narrow vent:</L>
<L>At la&s;t agreed together out they fly,</L>
<L>In&s;eparable now the truth and lie:</L>
<L>The &s;trict companions are for ever join'd,</L>
<L>And this or that unmix'd no mortal now can find.</L>
</LG>
<P>Excu&s;e this digre&s;&s;ion; it de&s;cribes but too truly the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate of the Bible; it is made to &s;ay any thing, or no|thing, ju&s;t as it &s;uits the party concerned. But, &s;ir, let us attend to the eternal rule of rectitude contained in it, and endeavour to &s;eparate the precious from the vile.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"CURSED be Canaan, a &s;ervant of &s;ervants &s;hall he be to his brethern," is your fir&s;t argument in defence of negro &s;lavery&mdash;you then a&s;k, "where
<PB N="7" REF="034442_0006_0FFDC903F757CD08">
this cur&s;e was ever removed?" and &s;peedily draw your conclu&s;ion, that the poor Africans mu&s;t be the de&s;|cendants of Ham!</P>
<P>1&s;t. Becau&s;e "the borders of the Canaanites were from Sidon as thou come&s;t to Gerar, unto Gaza;" and to prove your point, Philip met the eunuch in this road.</P>
<P>2d. Where a cur&s;e is, a <HI>mark</HI> you think will follow. The colour, &s;hape, and even the hair of their heads, prove the poor Africans to be children of the cur&s;e, and fit for nothing but <HI>drudgery and &s;lavery.</HI></P>
<P>In the 3d place, you labour to prove what no man denies, "that I&s;rael had their hired and bond &s;er|vants."</P>
<P>4th. That &s;lavery is not forbidden in the New Te&s;tament; therefore it is lawful to buy and keep &s;laves.</P>
<P>You conclude by &s;umming up the &s;criptures for and again&s;t &s;lavery, and of cour&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the majority on your own &s;ide.&mdash;You have not divided your pamph|let into &s;ections, but, as far as I can judge, the above is the &s;ub&s;tance of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall proceed to an&s;wer as briefly as po&s;&s;ible, and 1&s;t. The cur&s;e denounced upon Canaan, was re|voked in the de&s;truction of the Canaanites by I&s;rael. If you wi&s;h to lay any &s;tre&s;s on the words, "a &s;ervant of &s;ervants &s;hall he be," you &s;hall be a &s;ervant to the Jew, and the negro &s;hall be your's; for it is as probable that you are the de&s;cendant of Canaan as the Africans, notwith&s;tanding your curious ob&s;ervations in geogra|phy. Were not the Canaanites, without di&s;tinction, devoted to de&s;truction, on account of their abominable iniquities. The Gibeonites alone, by their &s;ubtilty, e&s;caped with the puni&s;hment of voluntary &s;lavery. And you cannot be ignorant of the judgments that befel I&s;rael for abu&s;ing tho&s;e <HI>hewers of wood and drawers of water.</HI></P>
<P>Do you a&s;k where the cur&s;e was removed? I refer you to the go&s;pel&mdash;there hear the word "<HI>it is fini&s;hed!</HI>"
<PB N="8" REF="034442_0007_0FFDC90592F02118">
admitting your own point, that the Ethiopians are the de&s;cendants of Ham, was not the cur&s;e removed from the eunuch you refer to? Being the amba&s;&s;ador of the queen of Candace, and returning from Jeru&s;alem, not as a &s;lave, but as the mini&s;ter of a great nation, he was baptized by Philip, and mo&s;t probably preached the go&s;pel of Je&s;us in his own country, where it flouri&s;hed for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>Pray, Mr. Lawrence, who were the Carthaginians, and out of who&s;e loins came the intrepid Hannibal? Were they not Africans? And though they were con|quered, they made a great &s;truggle for liberty.</P>
<P>Your 2d ob&s;ervation &s;carcely de&s;erves notice: how|ever, as the prejudice of the age is very &s;trong again&s;t the colour of the poor Africans, I &s;hall make a few remarks.&mdash;And fir&s;t, you &s;ay, "where a cur&s;e is, a mark will follow." Very true; the tree is known by its fruit. But who told you that the de&s;cendants of Canaan had a black &s;kin on account of the cur&s;e?&mdash;Neither &s;acred nor profane hi&s;torians: then it mu&s;t be the child of fancy, owing, I &s;uppo&s;e, to the devil being painted black. But you &s;hould remember the Africans, of late, not without cau&s;e, paint the devil white; and owing to &s;uch men as you, who de|fend &s;lavery, the name of a chri&s;tian is become more frightful to them than the devil him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave others to philo&s;ophi&s;e on the colour of &s;kins; it is enough for me, that the heat of the fire will turn mo&s;t things black. The &s;corching &s;un of Africa, without any cold winters to bleach, has per|haps had this effect, in a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, on the colour and hair of negroes; add to this, that when the colour becomes once tinged, in the union of the &s;exes, among&s;t all creatures, a likene&s;s is pro|duced, which may be a rea&s;on why the blacks do not change their hue &s;ooner in this country: when inter|marriages become general, the white colour will pre|vail in northern climates, but in more &s;outhern latitudes

<BIBL>COWPER.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>My 2d remark is on your ob&s;ervation about the &s;hape of negroes; "that they are formed for drud|gery," &amp;c. A man mu&s;t be &s;trangely prejudiced, not to &s;ee that both labour and thought affect the &s;hape of every human being. Hence you may know a cruel &s;lave-holder or tyrant by his complexion; as Mr. Jef|fer&s;on well ob&s;erves, "The whole commerce between ma&s;ter and &s;lave, is a perpetual exerci&s;e of the mo&s;t boi&s;terous pa&s;&s;ions, the mo&s;t unremitting de&s;poti&s;m on one part, and degrading &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the other: our children &s;ee this and imitate it. The parent &s;torms, the child looks on, catches the lineament of wrath, puts on the &s;ame airs, gives a loo&s;e to his wor&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions; and thus nur&s;ed and educated, and daily exerci&s;ed in tyranny, cannot but be &s;tamped with odi|ous peculiarities." Is it any wonder, that &s;o many of the negroes, between their hard labour, want of thought, and the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery, &s;hould want fine features? But notwith&s;tanding their condition, I have &s;een &s;ome hundreds of negroes as well made as any white man: be&s;ides, if you were to make &s;laves of all the awk|ward people, I am afraid many of your white brethren would come under the la&s;h.</P>
<P>I proceed to con&s;ider your third argument; "we read in the &s;criptures of hired &s;ervants and of bond &s;ervants." Yes, and of men having a great number
<PB N="10" REF="034442_0009_0FFDC90BA89B08E8">
of wives and concubines: but was it &s;o from the be|ginning? No, &s;ir, there is not a &s;ingle clau&s;e in the moral law that ju&s;tifies either.</P>
<P>But who are your great patterns of &s;lavery? Abra|ham and Solomon! Let us &s;ee what kind of &s;laves they had: the former had three hundred and eighteen trained &s;ervants, born in his hou&s;e, whom Jo&s;ephus calls re&s;pectable men, well in&s;tructed; they were a part of his family, had received the covenant of cir|cumci&s;ion, and adopted into the church of God; therefore could not be involuntary &s;laves. And if they were, how unlike your negro &s;laves! When do you in&s;truct them to read and write, and teach them to bear arms, to fight with their ma&s;ters? No, you are con&s;cious of guilt; therefore you mu&s;t not in&s;truct them, nor permit them to bear arms, le&s;t they &s;hould claim their indi&s;putable right&mdash;equal liberty with your|&s;elves.</P>
<P>But what manner of &s;laves had Solomon? Could the man who condemned oppre&s;&s;ion, and declares death to be more tolerable than &s;ubjection (Eccle&s;. iv.) keep involuntary &s;laves? No. But he brought the remnant of the Canaanites under tribute, and employed &s;ome of them, for a &s;ea&s;on, as bondmen, in the building of the temple, for which labour they were mo&s;t pro|bably paid along with Hiram's &s;ervants.</P>
<P>But now we have it, Lev&punc; xxv. 44, 45, 46. The Jews were permitted to buy of the heathen that were around them, and to leave their bondmen as an inhe|ritance for their children for ever. But what was to become of the children of the&s;e bondmen? Not a word about them! &s;urpri&s;ing, that the law did not mention, "they and their <HI>children</HI> &s;hall be your po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion for ever."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The children of bondmen were without doubt born <HI>free,</HI> in I&s;rael.</NOTE></P>
<P>The fact is, that the Levitical law knew nothing of involuntary &s;lavery, unle&s;s in the ca&s;e of theft or debt&mdash;and in either of tho&s;e ca&s;es, the year of jubilee
<PB N="11" REF="034442_0010_0FFDC910E13B6A70">
cleared all bondmen, without di&s;tinction. Read the 10th ver&s;e of Lev. xxv. And ye &s;hall hallow the fifti|eth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land, unto <HI>all</HI> the inhabitants thereof. The words for ever, in regard to bondage, could extend no farther than that year. In &s;hort, the I&s;raelites could not con&s;ider their &s;ervants as bondmen any longer than they u&s;ed them as them&s;elves; the &s;ame laws were made for the &s;tranger as for the I&s;raelite. But the poor negroes in America have no law to defend them&mdash;their evi|dence will not hold good again&s;t a white man; they may be abu&s;ed, tortured, and are often wantonly kil|led&mdash;but what can they do? Nothing.</P>
<P>If a bond &s;ervant ran away from his ma&s;ter in I&s;|rael, he was not to be delivered up to him again, but he was to live where he cho&s;e, "where it liketh him be&s;t&mdash;thou &s;halt not oppre&s;s him," Deut. xxiii. 15, 16. This plainly proves that the I&s;raelites had no other law to bind their bondmen, but the law of kind|ne&s;s. Thou&s;ands of &s;uch voluntary bondmen may be had at this day in Europe, who would willingly attach them&s;elves and families to good ma&s;ters. Yes, mo|ney would be given with them, provided their ma&s;ters would &s;upport them without becoming burden&s;ome to the public. What a contra&s;t between the bondmen which the Jews had, and tho&s;e which the Americans keep! There, if a &s;ervant ran away from his ma&s;ter, none dared to deliver him up again: but he was to live where he plea&s;ed: here; if a poor wretch runs away, for fear, perhaps, of being flogged to death, all the blood-hounds in the country are after him, and all the new&s;papers mu&s;t publi&s;h, to the eternal di&s;grace of their country, that &s;uch a negro has run away, with &s;o much reward for bringing him back, dead or alive; how many of the poor wretches are at this day wan|dering in the woods, and had rather &s;tarve them&s;elves to death than be taken; and when taken, how many put an end to their exi&s;tence, rather than bear the &s;corpion whips of their ma&s;ters. There were no &s;uch ca&s;es in I&s;rael? would to God there were none in A|merica!</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="034442_0011_0FFDC91276737BD0">
You triumph, by &s;aying, "Now as we have liberty from the Old Te&s;tament to buy and keep &s;laves, let us &s;earch our New Te&s;tament, and &s;ee if we can find it forbidden there." But &s;top, &s;in! where in the Old Te&s;tament can you find a pa&s;&s;age that ju&s;tifies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> doing either? Are you a Jew or a Gentile? The wi&s;e regulations contained in the Levitical law, concerning bondmen, appertained to the Jews alone;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of cour&s;e we as Gentiles have nothing to do with the Old Te&s;ta|ment Laws as it re&s;pects Slavery.</NOTE> and this was granted them upon the &s;ame ground as the law of divorce, and plurality of wives.</P>
<P>The 8th commandment expre&s;sly forbids your kind of &s;lavery: and the law of Mo&s;es condemns to death every &s;lave-holder in America; "He that &s;tealeth a man and &s;elleth him, or if he be found in his hand, &s;hall &s;urely be put to death."</P>
<P>Are there any in America at this day, &s;o wilfully ig|norant as not to know that the poor Africans were kid|napped from their native country, by a &s;et of <HI>mi&s;cre|ants,</HI> who ought to have been extirpated, long ago, from the face of the earth; knowing this property to be &s;tolen, you keep it &s;till in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, when you ought to return it to the right owners; wherefore, the blood of tho&s;e innocent men, you deprive of their rights, &s;hall be required at your hands.</P>
<P>How impertinently you apply the tenth command|ment to the friends of abolition. Can there be any thing more ab&s;urd! Pray, &s;ir, wear the cap your&s;elf, it fits you and your &s;laveholding brethern exceeding well: for what el&s;e but diabolical covetou&s;ne&s;s could tempt men to trade in their fellow-creatures

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I COME now to what I call your fourth head; where you &s;ay, <Q>If &s;lavery is not forbidden in the New Te&s;tament, we may lawfully keep &s;laves.</Q> By your leave, &s;ir, we may not. The New Te&s;tament does not forbid us, with St. Francis, to preach to fi&s;hes, and bapti&s;e hor&s;es and horned cattle. Com|mon &s;en&s;e, however, teaches us that &s;uch a con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> would be ab&s;urd. Cock-fighting, hor&s;e-racing, and various &s;pecies of iniquitous gaming, not then, per|haps, in u&s;e, are not forbidden in the New Te&s;tament, yet we know &s;uch practices to be contrary to the laws of Chri&s;t, and obnoxious to every idea we can form of moral virtue. But the go&s;pel, &s;ir, wherever its precepts are obeyed, aboli&s;hes &s;lavery: this is, at any rate, tantamount to its being forbidden.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ermon that Je&s;us Chri&s;t preached, pro|claimed liberty to the <HI>captives.</HI> All the prophets preached again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, and predicted the day of emancipation. Chri&s;t took his text from I&s;aiah, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 1, 2, and declared, that it was that day fulfilled in their ears. Glorious news! hear it: <Q>The &s;pirit of the Lord is upon me: becau&s;e he hath appointed me to preach the go&s;pel to the poor; he hath &s;ent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverence to the <HI>captives,</HI> and recovery of &s;ight to the blind; to &s;et at <HI>liberty</HI> them that are <HI>bound;</HI> to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</Q> And he clo&s;ed the
<PB N="14" REF="034442_0013_0FFDC9174505A500">
book&mdash;and if I was to do the &s;ame, this alone would be enough again&s;t &s;lavery. But perhaps you will &s;ay the above text has a &s;piritual meaning; and mo&s;t a&s;|&s;uredly it has a literal one. Religious and civil liber|ty go always hand in hand; they are, in &s;ome re&s;pects, as clo&s;ely connected as the &s;oul is to the body. The whole &s;y&s;tem of chri&s;tianity is called by James, "<HI>the perfect law of liberty.</HI>" It could not be <HI>perfect,</HI> unle&s;s it comprehended the whole family of man, and this it does in a con&s;picuous manner: the angels brought glad tidings of great joy unto all people, nations, kin|dred and tongue under heaven. The word go&s;pel &s;ignifies not only <HI>news</HI> but <HI>good news</HI> to all nations, and individuals who embrace the truth: and the truth &s;hall make them free.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay, that the believing &s;lave will be imme|diately liberated from an unbelieving ma&s;ter. But I dare venture to affirm and prove, that every believ|ing ma&s;ter, obeying the precepts of Chri&s;t, would &s;et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;laves at liberty without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, that the young man who came to Chri&s;t to a&s;k, "what he &s;hould do to inherit eternal life," to be a &s;laveholder; Chri&s;t told him to keep the commandments. O, he was a fine profe&s;&s;or! all this he had done! Chri&s;t admired him: and &s;o do I admire many things in my &s;lave-holding friends.&mdash;But Chri&s;t &s;aid, "there is one thing lacking, go and &s;ell all that thou ha&s;t and give to the poor." He might an&s;wer, if a &s;lave-holder, there are no poor in my neighbourhood, we all &s;upport our own &s;laves! Slaves, did&s;t thou &s;ay? What, go to heaven with a load of &s;laves on thy back! no, no, the gate is too &s;trait and the road too narrow for thee. Go and in|&s;truct them in the principles of liberty, then &s;et them free and give them &s;omething to begin the world with. When you have done this, take up your cro&s;s and fol|low me; my mi&s;&s;ion on earth is to preach-deliverance to the captives, to &s;et at liberty them that are bound, to do good to all, to love mine enemies, to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem of perfect equality among mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="034442_0014_0FFDC91CC8867308">
None of my di&s;ciples dare to lord it over one ano|ther. He that would be greate&s;t mu&s;t be the &s;ervant of all: <HI>I cannot admit a &s;lave-holder within the pales of my Church;</HI> if you would become my di&s;ciple, you mu&s;t deny your&s;elf the plea&s;ure of handling a cow&s;kin or a hickory to flog &s;laves. Yes, you mu&s;t deny your|&s;elf the plea&s;ure of their labour, unle&s;s you choo&s;e to pay them for it, and even then you mu&s;t forbear threat|ening, for my di&s;ciples mu&s;t be meekne&s;s and love. If you object and &s;ay, "I have paid for them," then you had no right to pay for what no man had a right to &s;ell; I cannot admit my followers even to &s;ell them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>If you have bought tho&s;e men, knowing them to be &s;tolen, Mo&s;es, in whom you tru&s;ted, will put you to death for it? and, if you had them from you fa|ther or great-grandfather, you are condemned ju&s;t the &s;ame, unle&s;s ye flee to me as the Saviour for refuge: and you mu&s;t know that I am come, not to deliver my people in their &s;ins, but from their &s;ins. If you would con&s;ider your&s;elf a <HI>chri&s;tian,</HI> your &s;laves mu&s;t be in&s;tructed and &s;et at liberty: they mu&s;t enjoy the &s;ame privileges with your&s;elf: but if you are determin|ed to keep them &s;till in bondage, you may expect the con&s;equence. Remember the fate of Pharoah, and repent in time.</P>
<P>St. Paul exhorted tho&s;e who had believing &s;ervants "not to de&s;pi&s;e them, becau&s;e they were brethren, but rather to do them &s;ervice, becau&s;e they are faithful and partakers of the benefit," that is, they are now paid for their &s;ervices, are well treated, and have full li|berty to change their ma&s;ters if they can better them|&s;elves. But what mu&s;t the poor &s;lave do, who has an unbelieving ma&s;ter? let him,

The precept will continue eternally the &s;ame; and, in order that you they under&s;tand it, I would &s;end you, for a few years, to be a &s;lave to the Algerines, who, by the bye, are angels when compared with many of the Engli&s;h and American &s;lave-holders. Your &s;aying, that, if you were a &s;lave, your holder had a right to keep you &s;o, is downright bla&s;phemy again&s;t ju&s;tice and common &s;en&s;e; if you was to &s;wear to this hypo|the&s;is, no man in his &s;en&s;es would believe you.</P>
<P>It is true, according to the laws of retaliation, the negroes have a right to make &s;laves of all their pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ders in America. "He that admits no right but force, no ju&s;tice but &s;uperior violence, arms every man again&s;t him&s;elf, and ju&s;tifies all exce&s;&s;es.

It ju&s;tifies your &s;laves, the in&s;tant they become the &s;tron|ger, in taking you, your wives and your children, and &s;eparate you from each other, force you to labour to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ic of whips and chains, from 4 o'clock in the morning till 8 at night, without any refre&s;hment but a little Indian meal and water, half naked, yes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;ome plantations quite naked, half &s;tarved and coop|ed up together at night in a cold, dirty hovel, cover|ed with wounds, brui&s;es, and putrifying &s;ores: rob|bed of every thing that is dear; &s;logged for praying, and tortured for preaching con&s;olation to your fellow &s;ufferers; and, after having exhau&s;ted your youth in &s;ervitude, you are abandoned in old age to wretched|ne&s;s and di&s;ea&s;es. This is not an exaggerated &s;tatement of the ca&s;e, but the real repre&s;entation of things which are in America in the year 1797. O &s;hame! where ha&s;t thou fled!</P>
<P>But it is the <HI>u&s;e</HI> and not the <HI>abu&s;e</HI> of &s;lavery which you defend: it is impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ir, to &s;eparate them: the whole &s;y&s;tem is abominably iniquitous.

in Europe. What then, if a man keeps his <HI>whores</HI> well, does that ju&s;tify his having them? I argue again&s;t the fir&s;t principles of &s;lavery; no man has a right to u&s;e or abu&s;e another without his con&s;ent, unle&s;s he be guilty of &s;ome crime again&s;t &s;ociety, which expo&s;es him to its vengeance; every individual in the univer&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es certain rights which no man can dive&s;t him of, without inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Your hackneyed phra&s;e, "Servants obey your ma&s;ters," &s;uits your purpo&s;e ju&s;t as well as <Q>Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone:</Q> where in the bible do you meet with the words "Slaves obey your tyrants"? no where. It is well known the word <HI>&s;lave</HI> is not to be found in the original text of the bible. The word <HI>&s;lave</HI> in Jer. ii. 14. is added by the tran&s;la|tors, and the word <HI>Somaton,</HI> rendered &s;laves in Rev. xviii. 13. &s;hould be tran&s;lated <HI>bodies</HI> as is the ca&s;e every where el&s;e. The word <HI>dou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s,</HI> and its derivatives, would read very awkward, if tran&s;lated <HI>&s;laves, &s;lave, &s;laving,</HI> &amp;c. in&s;tead of <HI>&s;ervant, &s;erve, &s;erving.</HI> A few quotations will be &s;ufficient to &s;hew the ab&s;urdity. Gen. xlii. 10. "But to buy food are thy <HI>&s;laves</HI> come." P&s;alm cxix. 91. <Q>They continue this day according to thine ordinances, for all are thy <HI>&s;laves.</HI></Q> Luke i. 38. and Mary &s;aid, "Behold the <HI>&s;lave</HI> of my Lord." Luke xv. 29. "Lo the&s;e many years do I <HI>&s;lave</HI> thee." Acts xx. 19. "<HI>Slaving</HI> the Lord with all humility of mind"!!!</P>
<P>That hired and indented &s;ervants &s;hould be exhort|ed to obey their ma&s;ters, is very rational; and was it not for the ruinous &s;y&s;tem of &s;lavery, it would be done more cheerfully. But

<P>With what face can any &s;lave holder pray for the &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel, whil&s;t he acts contrary to its fir&s;t principles?

They are corrupt and &s;peak wickedly concerning oppre&s;&s;ion. They &s;peak loftily. But he &s;hall judge the poor of the people. He &s;hall &s;ave the
<PB N="22" REF="034442_0021_0FFDC930F5A4AE68">
children of the needy, and &s;hall break in pieces the oppre&s;&s;or. The cry of the children of <HI>Africa</HI> is come unto me, and I have al&s;o &s;een the oppre&s;&s;ion where|with the <HI>Briti&s;h and the Americans</HI> oppre&s;s them; <HI>and</HI> I will break the yoke of their burden, and the rod of their oppre&s;&s;ors as in the day of Midian. Surely op|pre&s;&s;ion maketh <HI>a nation as well as</HI> a wi&s;e man mad.</P>
<P>So I returned and con&s;idered all <HI>the oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> that are done under the Sun: and behold the tears of &s;uch as were oppre&s;&s;ed, and they had no comforter; and on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">de of their oppre&s;&s;ors there was power. Wherefore the Lord God hath &s;worn by his holine&s;s, that lo, the day &s;hall come upon you, that unle&s;s you repent of your evil doings, he will take you away with hooks and your po&s;terity with fi&s;h-hooks.</P>
<P><HI>O Americans!</HI> thus &s;aith the Lord, execute judg|ment in the morning, and deliver him that is &s;poiled out of the hand of the oppre&s;&s;or; le&s;t my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it. Hear this now ye kine of Ba&s;han, which oppre&s;s the poor <HI>negroes</HI> and cru&s;h the needy among them; which &s;ay to their ma&s;ters, come and let us drink, for to-morrow will be as to day and much better: but thus &s;aith the Lord, woe to the oppre&s;&s;ing city! &s;he obeyed not my voice; &s;he received not correction, <HI>in her late &s;trug|gle for Liberty</HI> &s;he tru&s;ted not in the Lord <HI>that he would provide for her if in ca&s;e &s;he liberated her &s;laves;</HI> &s;he drew not near to her God to a&s;k coun&s;el of him, <HI>who fought her battles and e&s;tabli&s;hed her independence.</HI> Wherefore what have ye to do with me, <HI>O Southern States, nor are ye to the north, ea&s;t and we&s;t free from blood; for the poor Africans have ye bought and &s;old like cattle.</HI> Wherefore have I &s;old your &s;ons and your daughters to the <HI>Algerines and Indians,</HI> and I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a &s;wift witne&s;s again&s;t the <HI>&s;lave holders,</HI> and again&s;t tho&s;e who oppre&s;s the <HI>poor negroes,</HI> and turn away the &s;tranger from his right, for ye were &s;trangers your&s;elves <HI>at one time in this land.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore thou &s;halt neither vex a &s;tranger nor op|pre&s;s him; for ye know the heart of a &s;tranger. Wherefore thus &s;aith the holy One of I&s;rael, becau&s;e
<PB N="23" REF="034442_0022_0FFDC932D55D67F8">
ye de&s;pi&s;e this word, and tru&s;t in oppre&s;&s;ion and per|ver&s;ene&s;s and &s;tay thereon. His iniquity &s;hall be to you as a breach ready to fall &s;welling out in a high wall, who&s;e breaking cometh &s;uddenly at an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Therefore go to now ye rich men, weep and howl for your mi&s;eries that &s;hall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth|eaten: your gold and &s;ilver is cankered, and the ru&s;t of them &s;hall be a witne&s;s again&s;t you, and &s;hall eat your fle&s;h as it were fire. Behold the hire of the <HI>&s;laves</HI> which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them that have reaped and planted have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth: ye have lived in plea&s;ure on the earth and been wanton; ye have nouri&s;hed your hearts as in the day of &s;laughter. Ye have condemn|ed and killed the ju&s;t, and he (<HI>the poor African</HI>) doth not re&s;i&s;t you; <HI>but in a mournful tone after being &s;cour|ged and tortured to the la&s;t degree &s;aith with his expiring breath,</HI> "<HI>Ma&s;ter, you have killed me.</HI>"</P>
<P>For thy violence again&s;t thy brother, (<HI>the African</HI>) &s;hame &s;hall cover thy borders, <HI>O America!</HI> Becau&s;e I have called <HI>by a particular Providence upon you to &s;et them free, when you obtained your own liberty,</HI> and ye refu&s;ed. I have &s;tretched out my hand, <HI>&s;ince and &s;mote your borders, particularly the &s;eat of your Federal Govern|ment with a malignant &s;courge,</HI> but you have not re|garded. <HI>I have cau&s;ed an in&s;urrection to take place in the land, and have &s;ent forth a furious element to threat|en and de&s;troy your cities; your commerce likewi&s;e I have given as a pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y to contending powers.</HI> But ye have &s;et at nought all my coun&s;el, and would none of my re|proof; I al&s;o will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh as a de&s;olation, and your de|&s;truction cometh as a whirlwind: <HI>for I will continue to plague you more and more, until you let the Africans</HI> go free.</P>
<P><HI>Ye have fa&s;ted and kept days of thank&s;giving,</HI> but is not this the fa&s;t I have cho&s;en? to loo&s;e the bands of wickedne&s;s, to undo the heavy burden, and let the oppre&s;&s;ed <HI>African</HI> go free, and that ye break every yoke of <HI>bondage among you:</HI> therefore learn to do well; &s;eek judgment, relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed, <HI>and</HI> if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour, if ye oppre&s;s not the &s;tranger, &amp;c. Then

I will cau&s;e you to dwell in this place, in the land I have given to your fathers&punc; for ever and ever.&mdash;<HI>But if ye continue to keep the A|fricans in bondage,</HI> behold the day cometh that &s;hall burn as an oven; and all the proud <HI>oppre&s;&s;ors,</HI> yea, and all who do wickedly &s;hall be &s;tubble, and the day that cometh &s;hall burn them up, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, that it &s;hall leave them neither root nor branch. <HI>No not &s;o much as a &s;lave-holder in the world</HI></P>
<P>Then &s;hall the oppre&s;&s;ed take up this proverb again&s;t the <HI>tyrants</HI> and &s;ay; How hath the oppre&s;&s;or cea&s;ed! What &s;hall the prey be taken from the mighty, and the captive be delivered? But thus &s;aith the Lord, even the captives of the mighty &s;hall be taken away; and the prey of the terrible &s;hall be delivered; for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and will &s;ave thy children. And I will feed them that oppre&s;s thee with their own fle&s;h, and they &s;hall be DRUNKEN WITH THEIR OWN BLOOD, as with &s;weet wine. I, even I, am he that will comfort you <HI>O Africans!</HI>&mdash;Who art thou, that thou &s;hould'&s;t be afraid of a man that &s;hall die&mdash;and forgette&s;t the Lord thy maker; and ha&s;t feared every day continually becau&s;e of the fury of the oppre&s;&s;or, as if he was ready to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>And where is the fury of the oppre&s;&s;or? The captive-exile ha&s;te|neth that he may be loo&s;ened, and that he &s;hould not die in the pit; nor that his bread &s;hould fail. For it &s;hall come to pa&s;s in that day that his burden &s;hall be taken away from off thy &s;houlders, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke &s;hall be de&s;troyed becau&s;e of the anointing&mdash;<HI>becau&s;e of the promi&s;e and the oath of God, the unction of Liberty</HI> &s;hall be poured upon all fle&s;h; <HI>and</HI> Ethiopia <HI>among other nations</HI> &s;hall &s;tretch forth her hands to God. <HI>Yes, all the nations of the earth &s;hall like kindred drops of rain mingle together in one ocean of love</HI>&mdash;<HI>in one family of brethren.</HI> Then I &s;hall &s;ing&mdash;

<P>I hope Mr. L&mdash;and the Americans in general will think of the threatenings above quoted, and con&s;ider whil&s;t it is called to day, what belongs to their peace. I rejoice that there are &s;o many in the United States who abhor &s;lavery in their hearts; for their &s;akes, I tru&s;t the Lord will &s;pare the land from a deluge of blood. This is the fervent prayer of the author, who will behold, with tran&s;ports of joy the ri&s;ing empire of America e&s;tabli&s;hed in righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace.
