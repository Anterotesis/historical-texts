<BIBL>2 COR. III. 17.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;WHERE the Spirit of the LORD is, there is LIBERTY.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE glorious character, and the righteous, wi&s;e and good admini&s;tration of the Deity, lay the foundation of piety in all its bran|ches. From the con&s;ideration hereof internal wor&s;hip as well as public and &s;ocial, re&s;ult: The latter, as well as the former, is a rational act of homage paid to him who rules in the kingdoms of men, and conducts the grand as well as minute affairs of the univer&s;e: it is al&s;o a proper and natural expre&s;&s;ion of our belief of his &s;uperintendency and government of all things: a firm and practical belief of which fun|damental truth of religion hath a tendency to in|fluence the whole moral conduct. The practice
<PB N="6" REF="009017_0005_10306B75013AFCB8">
therefore of a&s;&s;embling in the hou&s;e of God upon this day, as it is coeval with our civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, is laudable, rational and ju&s;t; and may be con|&s;idered as an act of homage paid by the whole community to him who is the head of the &s;ocial &s;y&s;tem, the be&s;tower of every ble&s;&s;ing, and the &s;upreme guardian of all our rights.</P>
<P>VARIOUS are the &s;ubjects relative to this occa|&s;ion which are truly intere&s;ting. But as we are ju&s;t arrived at that happy period, in which by the &s;miles of heaven on our ju&s;t arms, we have obtained the entire conque&s;t of Canada; whereby we hope in God we are delivered from the tyranny and mi&s;ery which threatned us, "and the future &s;ecu|rity of our liberties civil and religious put into our hands:"&mdash;As it is al&s;o the happy day in which we are called to improve &s;ome of the im|portant privileges and liberties we enjoy by his grant, who delivered us from arbitrary power both in church and &s;tate; I could think of no &s;ubject which more ju&s;tly claims our attention than that which our text without any forced con&s;truction will &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT without any farther introduction, after humbly imploring the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t which is a &s;pirit of liberty&mdash;and a&s;king the candor and patience of all pre&s;ent, I &s;hall proceed to the con&s;ideration of my &s;ubject:&mdash;My concern &s;hall be to &s;peak with that freedom which the &s;pirit of the divine Redeemer
<PB N="7" REF="009017_0006_10306B780BEE9890">
in&s;pires, and at the &s;ame time with that reverence and decency which is due to &s;o re&s;pectable an auditory.</P>
<P>WITHOUT &s;pending time to review the whole pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture to which our text hath refe|rence, I &s;hall con&s;ider the words as a general truth, laid down upon a particular occa&s;ion; and &s;imilar in their intention to tho&s;e of our Lord,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John VIII. 34, 36.</NOTE> "Ye &s;hall know the truth and the truth &s;hall make you free".&mdash;And again "If the Son of GOD make you free, ye &s;hall be free indeed." Whether the apo&s;tle here intends a liberty from that darkne&s;s which tyrannized over the under&s;tanding of the Jews, or the liberty of the children of GOD in ge|neral, I &s;hall not pretend ab&s;olutely to determine: but &s;ay, that liberty in every re&s;pect &s;tands in con|nexion with the Spirit of Chri&s;t. The go&s;pel is &s;tiled "a law of liberty."&mdash;Being conformed to this, and animated and influenced by the &s;pirit of its divine author, we &s;hall be free from the &s;ervitude of Satan the grand tyrant, and the &s;lavery of &s;in, which is the wor&s;t of &s;ervitude, and from whence re&s;ult all the tyrannies, di&s;orders and confu&s;ions that have been in the world.</P>
<P>As civil government, which was in&s;tituted for the pre&s;ervation of civil liberty, effects in an im|perfect degree &s;ome of tho&s;e de&s;igns in GOD's righteous admini&s;tration, which he is carrying on in
<PB N="8" REF="009017_0007_10306B79CA50F5F0">
the world by his word and &s;pirit; and as liberty in a political &s;en&s;e is mentioned by a &s;acred writer as one of the privileges of chri&s;tians, as well as other men;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. II. 16.</NOTE> and as chri&s;tians are commanded <Q>to &s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made them free</Q>&mdash;what I propo&s;e from the&s;e words of the apo&s;tle, is
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. To &s;hew, That liberty both civil and religious is the &s;pirit and genius of the &s;acred writings.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THAT the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t prevailing in the hearts, and influencing the lives of mankind, is the greate&s;t &s;ecurity of liberty in both the&s;e re&s;pects.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>NEITHER the time nor my &s;trength will admit any thing more than a cur&s;ory and imperfect con&s;i|deration of the&s;e two particulars. But before I proceed to prove the truth of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, it is nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e a few things relative to the nature of civil and religious liberty.</P>
<P>I WOULD premi&s;e in general, that to &s;tate the nature of each, and exactly limit their bounds&mdash;to &s;ay in all re&s;pects what prerogative and powers the &s;overeign &s;hall be ve&s;ted with, excepting this in general, a power to do every thing which is requi|&s;ite for the pre&s;ervation and happine&s;s of the &s;tate:&mdash;to determine al&s;o what are the rights and privi|leges
<PB N="9" REF="009017_0008_10306B7E71BE8AF8">
of the &s;ubject, and to fix the mea&s;ures of his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion&mdash;I &s;ay, the determining the&s;e points with preci&s;ion, would be attempting what would be beyond my line, and would require more time than the limits of a di&s;cour&s;e upon this occa&s;ion would allow.&mdash;Therefore I &s;hall give you the definition of civil liberty from an approved writer,&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> AMAQUI.</NOTE> <Q>that it is natural liberty it &s;elf, dive&s;ted of that part which con&s;titutes the independence of in|dividuals by the authority it confers on &s;ove|reigns, attended with a right of in&s;i&s;ting on his making a good u&s;e of his authority, and with a moral &s;ecurity this right will have it's effect.</Q> As civil liberty is founded in civil government, a well con&s;tituted &s;tate requires that the magi&s;trate be &s;ecure of the allegiance of the &s;ubject, and the &s;ub|ject of the protection of the magi&s;trate: and civil liberty is in the greate&s;t perfection, and tho&s;e are the free&s;t governments, where, on the one hand, the &s;overeign is &s;ecured from tyranny and an abu&s;e of power, and the people from anarchy, confu&s;ion and di&s;obedience. And though in &s;uch a &s;tate na|tural liberty is in many re&s;pects given up, yet if civil liberty, the liberty of civil &s;ociety is &s;ecured, con&s;idering the &s;tate of the world, it is va&s;tly to be preferred:&mdash;For hereby each one becomes &s;ecured of the protection and united force and coun&s;el of the whole &s;tate, whereby life, property and every thing el&s;e that is valuable, is almo&s;t infinitely better &s;ecured, than in a &s;tate of natural liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="009017_0009_10306B802802CC40">
I WOULD further premi&s;e, as civil authority extends to the good of the community in all re&s;pects, it mu&s;t extend to religion; piety and vertue being connected with the good of civil &s;ocieties as well as individuals: we may add, how far &s;oever civil authority may think it requi&s;ite to interpo&s;e in affairs of religion, as the right of private judgment is unalienable&mdash;and &s;ince it is e&s;&s;ential to true religion that we act from con&s;cience and a con|viction that what we profe&s;s and practi&s;e is agreable to the divine will&mdash;religious liberty ever &s;uppo&s;es, and it is requi&s;ite to its being that the con&s;cience be le&s;t free, and that none pretend to a&s;&s;ume an empire over it. Religious liberty &s;uppo&s;es that there be not only free inquiry, but equal freedom of profe&s;&s;ion and action, when thereby no di&s;tur|bance is given to others. Indeed &s;hould any under pretence of con&s;cience, act in direct violation of the laws of GOD, to the injury of the peace of civil or religious &s;ocieties, they ought to be re&s;trained.&mdash;For there is no liberty but what &s;uppo&s;es our de|pendence upon GOD, and our obligations to com|ply with his will. And under the pretence of liberty to act as we li&s;t, or to di&s;regard the dictates of rea&s;on or the will of GOD, however made known, or any authority he has con&s;tituted, is libertini&s;m and licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>ONCE more, it may be premi&s;ed, that altho' chri&s;tianity was properly e&s;tabli&s;hed by GOD him|&s;elf or his &s;on Chri&s;t Je&s;us&mdash;it being that kingdom
<PB N="11" REF="009017_0010_10306B822620D570">
which the prophet Daniel foretold, "the GOD of heaven &s;hould &s;et up, and &s;hall never be de&s;troyed, but &s;hall &s;tand forever;<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Dan. ii. 44.</NOTE>&mdash;And although this kingdom was founded when the power of the civil magi&s;trate was armed for it's de&s;truction:&mdash;yet &s;hould the civil authority think it nece&s;&s;ary, as they have in almo&s;t all chri&s;tian countries, to e&s;tabli&s;h any particular form of chri&s;tianity, let it be con|&s;idered that all &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments are evidently human; and unle&s;s there be a general toleration, are incon&s;i&s;tent with religious liberty. It is a no|ble declaration of a writer of the fir&s;t cla&s;s,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bp. BUTLER's Serm. on 1 Tim. II. 1, 2.</NOTE> that <Q>a religious e&s;tabli&s;hment, without a toleration of &s;uch as think they cannot in con&s;cience conform to it, is it &s;elf a general tyranny, becau&s;e it claims ab&s;olute authority over con&s;cience; and would &s;oon beget particular kinds of tyranny of the wor&s;t &s;ort, tyranny over the mind, and various &s;uper&s;titions, after the way &s;hould be paved for them, as it &s;oon mu&s;t by ignorance.</Q></P>
<P>THESE things being premi&s;ed, I &s;hall proceed to the proof of the fir&s;t ob&s;ervation I mentioned, viz. that liberty, both civil and religious, is the &s;pirit and genius of the &s;acred writings.</P>
<P>THE great de&s;ign of infinite wi&s;dom in the various revelations there have been made in the
<PB N="12" REF="009017_0011_10306B85126FC5B8">
different ages of the world, has been to promote the cau&s;e of liberty in the noble&s;t and mo&s;t im|portant &s;en&s;e. As accompli&s;hing the amazing plan of the redemption of a fallen world by the Son of God, and recovering us from the penal effects of &s;in, which were a mo&s;t terrible bondage and mi&s;ery; as this is the general intention of revelation, liberty, without any impropriety, may be &s;aid to be the general intention of revelation. And altho' &s;ome|thing infinitely greater and more valuable than what relates to this world is de&s;igned; yet we &s;hall find that he who accompli&s;hes various important ends at the &s;ame time by the &s;ame means, con&s;ul|ted man's happine&s;s in this as well as the future &s;tate.</P>
<P>LIBERTY being the foundation of almo&s;t every temporal ble&s;&s;ing, and al&s;o tho&s;e which are ever|la&s;ting being in a near connexion with it, upon an examination of the &s;acred writings, we &s;hall find through the whole, a particular regard to this in|e&s;timable favour. Were we to trace the whole book of God, as every part was wrote by the &s;ame unerring &s;pirit of truth, we &s;hall find nothing that tends to countenance anarchy, or &s;upport tyranny either civil or religious; but on the con|trary a &s;pirit of liberty breathing thro' the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="009017_0012_10306B88C29F8628">
So large a field opens when we take a view of the &s;acred books, that I mu&s;t confine my &s;elf to a very few pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>To begin with the writings of Mo&s;es, there we &s;hall find that in the execution of the grand plan before-mentioned, heaven appears in a mo&s;t &s;ignal manner to re&s;cue a particular people from a &s;tate of the mo&s;t mi&s;erable tyranny and &s;ervitude. The whole hi&s;tory of that important event, the delive|rance of I&s;rael from their Egyptian bondage, &s;hews in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, God's tender compa&s;&s;ion for the rights of his people, and that he will &s;ooner or later appear to take vengeance on the tyrants and cruel oppre&s;&s;ors of mankind. The noble&s;t eloquence, in&s;pired by the warme&s;t &s;pirit of liberty, could not u&s;e &s;tronger expre&s;&s;ions than are found in the &s;acred writers when they touch upon this &s;ubject. The infinite Being is thus repre&s;ented as &s;peaking upon this occa&s;ion,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. III. 7, 8. Acts VII. 24.</NOTE> <Q>I have &s;een, I have &s;een the affliction of my people which is in Egypt: I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them</Q>. And he, who never manife&s;ted his power in an extraordi|nary manner but for purpo&s;es becoming the wi&s;|dom of the deity, by a &s;eries of mo&s;t amazing miracles, &s;et his people free. And as the redemp|tion of his people, and taking vengeance on his
<PB N="14" REF="009017_0013_10306B8B733684F8">
enemies &s;tood in connexion, which has been the general cour&s;e of the divine admini&s;tration:&mdash;by the amazing de&s;truction of the latter, the divine power was made known in &s;uch a &s;triking manner, as that hereby the remote&s;t nations and di&s;tant ages were taught God's righteous abhorrence of &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, as Pharoah and his court impiou&s;ly and cruelly pur&s;ued.&mdash;God who di&s;|played his power in &s;o remarkable a manner to vindicate the rights of his people, appears by the &s;acred writings to have the greate&s;t regard to pro|per government and order. This people were not delivered from the tyranny of Egypt to be given up to a &s;tate of anarchy or their own law|le&s;s lu&s;ts, nor to be delivered over into the hands of tyrants of their own nation; but to be formed into a kingdom under the government of the Lord Jehovah.&mdash;He, who&s;e right to dominion is incon|te&s;tible, and who&s;e qualifications for government are unrivalled, conde&s;cended to become in a politi|cal and peculiar &s;en&s;e their king. Their &s;tate is therefore called, in &s;cripture language, the kingdom of Jehovah: and the LORD is &s;aid to be "their lawgiver, their king and judge": and he &s;tiles them "my people" and "my nation":&mdash;and their government is commonly called a Theocracy. Not that we are to con&s;ider this as barely a poli|tical con&s;titution. The fir&s;t and grand de&s;ign of
<PB N="15" REF="009017_0014_10306B8E2A713C00">
infinite wi&s;dom was, to &s;ecure that people in their allegiance to him as the moral governor of the world, and to redeem them from idolatry and wickedne&s;s&mdash;or, as the &s;cripture expre&s;&s;es it, to be "a kingdom of prie&s;ts and a holy nation". But not only the recovery of that people to the practice of true religion, the mo&s;t effectual &s;ecurity of all government, were in view, in the di&s;pen&s;a|tions of heaven towards them, but their happine&s;s in every re&s;pect. Therefore he who had mani|fe&s;ted his favor to them, regarded with peculiar kindne&s;s their civil or political &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE time will not allow a particular examina|tion of the civil government of the Hebrews; therefore I &s;hall only &s;ay in general, &s;o far as the plan of this government was of divine original, we &s;hall not only find the highe&s;t marks of politi|cal wi&s;dom, but that it was a polity which with the utmo&s;t propriety might be termed a free go|vernment; and was intended in the be&s;t manner to &s;ecure the liberties, happine&s;s, peace and pro&s;|perity of that people; had they adhered to this excellent con&s;titution, it would have &s;ecured them from all tyranny, oppre&s;&s;ion and anarchy, and from foreign invaders.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="009017_0015_10306B902F99B310">
THE right of legi&s;lation, the fir&s;t branch of &s;overeignty, was in the Lord Jehovah him&s;elf, All their laws as well civil as religious were from him&mdash;"whatever he commanded, that they were to ob&s;erve and do, and not to add thereto or di|mini&s;h from it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. XII. 32.</NOTE>." And as good laws are one of the greate&s;t &s;ecurities of the civil liberties of a peo|ple, we &s;hall find &s;uch enacted by the Lord Jeho|vah, relative to their con&s;titution and form of go|vernment, and the private admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, as would in the mo&s;t effectual manner have pre&s;er|ved the peace and happine&s;s of the community, and the liberty and property of each individual.</P>
<P>Again, THO' he who has an ab&s;olute and un|derived right to &s;overeignty, and to whom all be|ings owe &s;ubjection, was at the head of this &s;y&s;tem;&mdash;yet this government, like all other free govern|ments, was founded on compact. The whole congregation of I&s;rael, as a political body, acknow|ledged the Lord Jehovah to be their king, took an oath of allegiance to him, and he receives them for a people to him&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. XIX. 10, 17.</NOTE> But altho' the Lord Je|hovah was their king, and the power of legi&s;lation was only in him; yet the executive part of govern|ment was put into the hands of &s;ubordinate ma|gi&s;trates. Their &s;upreme magi&s;trate under the

Lord Jehovah mu&s;t be con&s;idered as his Vice|roy or deputy&mdash;and Mo&s;es who was the fir&s;t in this office was commi&s;&s;ioned immediately from God. Jo&s;hua who &s;ucceeded him was al&s;o pointed out by the oracle; yet his authority was recognized by the people<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. 1. 16, 17, 18.</NOTE>. The&s;e judges or leaders in the jew|i&s;h polity were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a limited &s;en&s;e of regal power&mdash;though let it be ob&s;erved, the ap|pointment of a king afterwards was a deviation from their original con&s;titution. But whatever was the authority of their &s;upreme magi&s;trate, he could a&s;&s;ume no arbitrary power; and by this con&s;titution there was the greate&s;t &s;ecurity that the power would be improved for the end for which it was given. The law was to be his rule in all things&mdash;the oracle was al&s;o to be con&s;ulted in the mo&s;t im|portant affairs. There was al&s;o a national &s;enate formed out of the princes of the tribes and heads of families<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h, XXIII. 1, 2.</NOTE> as his privy council, which was to be con&s;ulted; and the whole congregation of I&s;rael were by the con&s;titution one branch of government, and were inve&s;ted with as many rights and privi|leges perhaps, as any of the mo&s;t antient and free&s;t governments.</P>
<P>FREEDOM and property &s;tand in connexion; property ever carrying power and authority&mdash;the grant of the land of Canaan, from the great

In arbritary governments there is no &s;ecurity of property, if there are freeholders; but the I&s;raelites, holding their lands of Jehovah their King, and no &s;ubordi|nate magi&s;trate however great, having power to invade the property of the meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects; the law al&s;o prohibiting the loan of money upon intere&s;t,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The peculiar plan of the Hebrew polity &s;heweth the rea&s;on of the law prohibiting u&s;ury, and the loan of money upon intere&s;t not being forbid to &s;trangers, proves that law not to have been of a moral nature.</NOTE> prevented any from ingro&s;&s;ing large quantities of land; hereby all were &s;ecured from a &s;tate of &s;ervitude. The &s;pirit of freedom which appears in all the Hebrew con&s;titution, is likewi&s;e peculiarly manife&s;ted in the provi&s;ion it made for the pre&s;ervation of the liberties of the lowe&s;t and poore&s;t among them. Providence having endued per&s;ons with different capacities and abilities, and giving different &s;ucce&s;s, even to the endeavors of

<P>OUR Lord when he fir&s;t entered upon his public mini&s;try declared, he came not to de&s;troy the law and the prophets: But as his kingdom was not of this world he intermedled not with civil affairs, but left the Jewi&s;h polity as he found it.

THERE is a pa&s;&s;age in the writings of St. Peter &s;imi|lar in &s;ome re&s;pects to this of St. Paul: the former as well as the latter is recommending the great duty of &s;ubjection to the civil magi&s;trate, (1 Ep. 2d Chap. 13.&mdash;) That which St. Paul calls the ordinance of God, St. Peter &s;tiles the ordinance of man: As all civil governments, the Jewi&s;h excepted, are hu|man con&s;titutions; that is, their form whatever it be, is the in&s;titution and contrivance of men; but it is the will of God, plainly made known by the make of man, and his circum&s;tances in the world, as well as by revelation, there &s;hould be civil govern|ment.

UPON a view of the prophetic writings of the apo&s;tles we find the &s;ame &s;pirit of liberty breathing in them, as in the predictions of the former prophets&mdash;St. Paul's portrait of the man of &s;in&mdash;the hateful features with which he delineates him&mdash;the &s;pirit of domination he would di&s;cover, and tyranny he would exerci&s;e&mdash;the wicked and delu&s;ive arts he would make u&s;e of to acquire and &s;upport his unju&s;t claims&mdash;the apo&s;tle's &s;tiling him "the wicked one," and "&s;on of perdition"&mdash;and a&s;&s;uring us, he is doomed by the righteous vengeance of God to de&s;truction, proves that &s;uch a character, let it be found where it will, and however it may pretend to a divine right to &s;uch a plenitude of power, is really in its nature directly oppo&s;ite to the &s;pirit and genius of chri&s;tia|nity:&mdash;which is further proved by the apo&s;tle's in|timations, that no &s;uch per&s;on or power &s;hould ap|pear in the chri&s;tian church till there was a great

<P>IN the apocalyp&s;e of St. John we have a variety of &s;triking emblems, or hioroglyphic repre&s;entations of tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive and per&s;ecuting powers that were to ari&s;e to the di&s;turbance of the church in fu|ture ages. But tho' there are many expre&s;s pro|phecies that &s;uch tyrannical powers &s;hould ari&s;e and continue a long time&mdash;that they &s;hould "bla&s;pheme God," and "make war with the &s;aints, and over|come them," and "that none &s;hould be permitted to buy or &s;ell, &s;ave he that had the mark, or the name of the bea&s;t;" yet for the &s;upport of God's people under all, they are a&s;&s;ured that when the my&s;tery of God &s;hall be fini&s;hed, in &s;uffering &s;uch wickedne&s;s to prevail, the reign of the grand tyrant, and of all the enemies and per&s;ecutors of God's people &s;hall have an end: And that all the oppo&s;ers of religion and liberty &s;hall finally meet with a puni&s;hment, great in its extent, and la&s;ting in its duration, adequate to the enormity of their crimes.

<P>BEFORE this head is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, it may be proper to add a few words, more fully to &s;hew that religi|ous liberty is the &s;pirit and genius of the new-te&s;ta|ment. This is &s;o apparent to every one who has read tho&s;e writings with any attention, that it &s;eems little le&s;s than an affront offered to the under&s;tanding to undertake a formal proof of this point.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH in the new-te&s;tament an entire a&s;&s;ent and ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is required to be paid to what God has revealed as his will; (a belief and practice of which is true liberty) yet we find no authority given to men to employ force or compul|&s;ion in things &s;olely religious; no authority over con&s;cience:&mdash;yea, no power to men to make laws for the &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t's kingdom,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>ALTHO' chri&s;tians as members of civil &s;ociety, owe the &s;ame &s;ubjection to the civil magi&s;trate with other men; yet as chri&s;tians they are &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t their only King. "Every &s;ociety is &s;ubject only to its own legi&s;la|ture, which holds equally in re&s;pect to religious as civil &s;ocieties." And when it was before &s;aid, the civil ma|gi&s;trates power extended to religion, it was intended only as it &s;tood in connexion with the civil intere&s;ts of the community.</P>
<P>IT may be added, As the civil magi&s;trate is to protect all in their ju&s;t rights; and as many invaluable privileges are granted by the go&s;pel charter to the church of Chri&s;t, as a religious &s;ociety&mdash;And as the&s;e rights are no ways incon&s;i&s;tent with the civil rights of the re&s;t of mankind; the church in general, and each member of it, have the &s;ame claim to protection, and the unmole&s;ted enjoyment of all their privileges, that any other &s;ociety or individual have in the enjoyment of their natural or civil rights.</P>
<P>AND it is humbly queried, whether if the civil magi&s;trate was to grant this protection and defence to chri&s;tians, and chri&s;tian &s;ocieties, he would not more effectually an&s;wer the character of <HI>a nur&s;ing father to the church,</HI> and be le&s;s likely to invade the prerogative of the &s;upreme head of the church, than by decreeing articles of faith and modes of wor&s;hip?</P></NOTE>; or to en|force

<P>FURTHERMORE, The &s;criptures are &s;aid to be &s;ufficient for doctrine, and all the purpo&s;es of religi|on:&mdash;and no other rule of faith or practice is pre|&s;cribed&mdash;and all are commanded "to &s;earch the &s;criptures,"&mdash;to "prove all things and to try the &s;pirits whether they be of God."</P>
<P>WE find al&s;o our Lord and his apo&s;tles in the cour&s;e of their mini&s;try, referring religion to the free enquiry and impartial judgment of their hearers: If there was not evidence for what they taught, they gave liberty to reject it; but if truth, it was not to be di&s;regarded under the &s;evere&s;t penalties,

<P>IN a word, Chri&s;t's yoke is ea&s;y, and his burden light: He aboli&s;hed the ceremonial law:&mdash;He has al&s;o granted by his go&s;pel invaluable privileges and liberties to his church and people. His apo&s;tles al&s;o, when a &s;pirit of bigotry and domination early appeared in the chri&s;tian church, di&s;covered a ten|der regard to the liberties of chri&s;tians. And an adherence to tho&s;e grand apo&s;tolic canons, "to &s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free,"&mdash;and "let every man be fully per&s;uaded in his own mind;" will ever &s;ecure us from &s;piritual tyranny; and mo&s;t effectually advance the peace of Chri&s;t's church, and the intere&s;t of true religion.</P>

The mo&s;t exalted piety influencing his whole conduct, with the great|e&s;t fidelity he di&s;charged all the duties of his high office as mediator: He has this character given him by the author of the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, that "he was faithful to him who had appointed him&punc;<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 3. 2.</NOTE>"&punc; It might largely be &s;hewn, were it nece&s;&s;ary, that Chri&s;t an&s;wered this character in all re&s;pects. But I go on to &s;ay, that a conformity to this example in civil rulers, whether &s;upreme or &s;ubordinate, will lead them in every office they &s;u&s;tain, to act in a regard to his will and authority who is the &s;upreme governor of all; and to whom all are accountable. As the Son of God is repre&s;ented in the &s;acred oracles, &s;aying to his heavenly Father, upon his ma|king his entrance into this world, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God;" the like temper prevailing in the &s;overeign, and in all inferior officers, will lead them in the fir&s;t place to make enquiry, what are the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ies of their &s;tation, and what mu&s;t be done to di&s;charge them with fidelity. They will then &s;ee that the more elevated their &s;tation, the greater the importance of acting up to the de&s;ign and dignity
<PB N="48" REF="009017_0047_10306BE8EF4E7D28">
of it; and the more fatal and exten&s;ive the con&s;e|quences of a neglect. Which con&s;iderations will lead them with the greate&s;t care to learn, and faith|fulne&s;s to di&s;charge, the duties of every tru&s;t. And if all in office, in any &s;tate, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, exhibit this fidelity, and are ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God, none of the rights of mankind will be invaded; but power and authority will be improved for the honor of the &s;upreme ruler, and the happi|ne&s;s and &s;ecurity of all. Then, neither a love of power or intere&s;t, plea&s;ure or ea&s;e, private animo&s;i|ties or friend&s;hips, will tempt them from their inte|grity, or lead them to an omi&s;&s;ion of the duties of their office.</P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;hining part of our Lord's character was, the mo&s;t noble and exten&s;ive benevolence. The whole plan of our redemption, and the part which the Son of God performed in the execution of it, di&s;cover unparrallelled goodne&s;s, grace and compa&s;&s;ion. Not only the mo&s;t &s;elf-denying and di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, productive of the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial ble&s;&s;ings to mankind, appears in the character of our divine Redeemer; but he ever &s;hewed a peculiar regard to the intere&s;t of his own nation: His per&s;onal mini&s;try was confined chiefly to the Jews. How unweariedly did he exert him&s;elf in their &s;ervice? How pathetically did he lament the calamities he fore&s;aw coming upon them? So that we may ju&s;tly &s;ay, that PATRIOTISM, as well
<PB N="49" REF="009017_0048_10306BEBA11F89B8">
as more exten&s;ive benevolence is recommended by his example. And if we are taught of God to love one another, taught by the example and &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, there will not only be a love to the whole human &s;pecies, as children of the &s;ame parent with our&s;elves, and to all who are di&s;ciples of the &s;ame ma&s;ter; but from &s;ocial connections and engage|ments, and one common intere&s;t, there will be a pe|culiar regard to the intere&s;t of our country,&mdash;or <Q>a fixed di&s;po&s;ition of mind to promote the &s;afety, reputation and welfare of the community in which we are born, and the con&s;titution under which we are protected.</Q>&mdash;And while a love to our country is accompanied with a more exten&s;ive bene|volence, it will lead to a conduct productive of the independence and welfare of the community and each individual, as well as prevent an inva&s;ion of the rights of others. Then, in&s;tead of &s;eeking every one his own, as is too commonly the ca&s;e, the pub|lic good will be our main pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>AGAIN, The &s;pirit of Chri&s;t and his holy religion is a &s;pirit of union and peace. Our Lord is &s;tiled the prince of peace; and he came not only preach|ing peace, but his whole behaviour wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> expre&s;&s;ive of that ble&s;&s;ing: And the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ions are u&s;ed in the go&s;pel to repre&s;ent his union with his di&s;ciples, and their near and intimate union one with another. Now this &s;pirit being found in all,
<PB N="50" REF="009017_0049_10306BEF56055828">
will not only prevent tho&s;e factions and divi&s;ions, which are the bane of every &s;ociety, and which have often de&s;troyed the liberties of a free people, but will beget harmony of councils, and joint endeavours for the public tranquility.</P>
<P>OTHER virtues might be mentioned which ador|ned the character of the Son of God, and which are found in tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his &s;pirit.&mdash;As the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;t artle&s;s &s;implicity and &s;incerity: guile was not found in his mouth. To which was added, dignity of de&s;ign, and greatne&s;s&punc; of intention: His whole de&s;ign was the mo&s;t exalted that the heart of man can conceive; and not only executed with an heroic fortitude and con&s;tancy, amid&s;t oppo&s;ition and difficulties; but carried on with the greate&s;t &s;incerity and openne&s;s. A conformity to this ex|ample, and the univer&s;al prevalence of this &s;pirit in a community mu&s;t advance its glory, promote its happine&s;s, and &s;ecure its liberties; as it will in&s;pire tho&s;e entru&s;ted with the public intere&s;t with the mo&s;t noble de&s;igns and generous intentions; and lead them to pro&s;ecute them, if called to it, at the ex|pence of ea&s;e, intere&s;t and life; and as it will prevent tho&s;e political and factious views, cloaked with fal&s;e pretences to patrioti&s;m, which lead to a conduct &s;ub|ver&s;ive of the liberties of a people.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e principles in&s;pired all, and the&s;e virtues of the chri&s;tian life, and others which might be men|tioned

were practiced by all, &s;uch a &s;tate, whatever was its form of government, mu&s;t be free. Even in ab&s;olute monarchies, if the &s;overeign is influenced by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t and his religion, without any checks to his power, or fundamental laws or compact to regulate his conduct, he will make the &s;upreme law of all governments <HI>the &s;afety and happine&s;s of the people,</HI> and not arbitrary will, his rule. Like|wi&s;e in mixed governments, however the &s;overeignty may be &s;hared, the&s;e principles will lead all in their re&s;pective &s;tations and &s;pheres to &s;eek the public welfare. Then tho&s;e who have the power of legi&s;|lation will enact &s;uch laws, and &s;uch only, as are agreeable to the laws of the &s;upreme Ruler, the ge|nius and exigencies of the people, and their &s;afety and happine&s;s. Tho&s;e al&s;o in executive power will act in conformity to law: And the &s;alutary effects of government being experienced by all, authority will be revered, and from principle and con&s;cience &s;ubmitted to. Indeed, the univer&s;al prevalency and influence of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t and his religion will in a great mea&s;ure render human laws needle&s;s&mdash;all being a law to them&s;elves, and from principle and con&s;cience acting in conformity to the laws of their great Lord and ma&s;ter.&mdash;How happy mu&s;t &s;uch a &s;tate be!

<P>MANY u&s;eful reflections might be deduced from this &s;ubject, but my di&s;cour&s;e has already been protracted to &s;uch a length, that I may only hint at a few.</P>
<P>FIRST, THE &s;pirit and genius of the &s;acred oracles may be con&s;idered as a pre&s;umptive argument in
<PB N="53" REF="009017_0052_10306BF7B1BC19F8">
favour of their truth and divine original. Not only the external evidence, but the internal marks and characters of a revelation are to be taken into con&s;i|deration.&mdash;The repre&s;entation now made of the nature and de&s;ign of the &s;criptures, &s;hew them not to be unworthy of God, or un&s;uitable to the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of man. Had the&s;e writings been dictated by impo&s;ture or enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;o great and good a de&s;ign could not have been expected.</P>
<P>WE may al&s;o infer, That tho&s;e who plead for the divine right of ab&s;olute monarchy, or of it's indefea&s;ible lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and ab&s;olute &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to arbitrary will and lawle&s;s &s;way&mdash;or who would de&s;troy all order and government, and &s;ubject mankind to the confu&s;ions and mi&s;eries of anarchy, mu&s;t have &s;ome other &s;upport for their re&s;pective &s;chemes than the word of God.</P>
<P>AGAIN, It may be inferred from this di&s;cour&s;e, that the &s;pirit of Domination, that has appeared in the chri&s;tian church, and the per&s;ecutions and cru|elties, with which it has been accompanied and &s;up|ported, are truly antichri&s;tian.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ubject likewi&s;e teaches us, as we value our liberties, either civil or &s;acred, to prize the go&s;|pel, and to &s;eek and cultivate the &s;pirit of it's di|vine author. Not only tho&s;e &s;tates that were once mo&s;t famed for liberty, as Greece and Rome, &s;unk into &s;lavery when they lo&s;t their virtue; but when
<PB N="54" REF="009017_0053_10306BFA5EA9A7B8">
the kingdom of God was taken from the Jews, they were given up to the oppre&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t cruel tyranny&mdash;This al&s;o is in general the &s;tate of tho&s;e places who were once ble&s;&s;ed with the go&s;pel, but have now lo&s;t it.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t proceed to a more particular ap|plication of my &s;ubject&mdash;And beg leave upon this occa&s;ion, in the fir&s;t place to addre&s;s my &s;elf to THE GUARDIANS OF OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES; under which denomination, I comprehend all our honoured Rulers and political Fathers, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed either of legi&s;lative or executive power.&mdash;</P>
<P>MY honored Fathers will permit me, with all due re&s;pect, to remind them of the great and im|portant tru&s;t committed to them by God and Man.</P>
<P>ALL power is originally from God, and civil go|vernment his in&s;titution, and is de&s;igned to effect &s;ome of the great de&s;igns of his moral admini&s;tration, and to advance the happine&s;s of his creatures. Civil power ought therefore ever to be employed agreable to the nature and will of the &s;upreme Sovereign and Guardian of all our rights.</P>
<P>BUT tho' civil power is the ordinance of heaven, yet is it to be con&s;idered as granted al&s;o by the people&mdash;and granted for very important ends: the natural independence they give up, and liberty they part with, is for the &s;ecurity of civil liberty. And
<PB N="55" REF="009017_0054_10306BFD0F4CCF20">
civil &s;ociety is a mo&s;t &s;alutary in&s;titution&mdash;a &s;tate far be&s;t adapted to the happine&s;s of man, according to the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of things. Unnumber'd are the ble&s;&s;ings that re&s;ult from this &s;tate, when civil authority is improved for the purpo&s;es for which it is granted. Then each individual enjoys all tho&s;e rights which are the gift of the univer&s;al Parent; having al&s;o the protection of government, and the &s;ecurity of laws; from whence re&s;ult too many ad|vantages to be now enumerated. But the enjoy|ment of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings mainly depend upon the con|duct of tho&s;e ve&s;ted with civil power. It is there|fore a mo&s;t important tru&s;t that &s;uch per&s;ons have committed to them: and upon a faithful di&s;charge of it, the happine&s;s of the whole civil &s;ociety mainly, under God, depends. You do well therefore, Gen|tlemen, to con&s;ider the happine&s;s of this people, not only in the pre&s;ent time but in future genera|tions, (for few acts of government are limited in their operations to the pre&s;ent time) committed to your care.

<P>BUT the following things, which you will &s;uffer me to remind you of, give an additional &s;trength

<P>WE have long had the happine&s;s of enjoying a mo&s;t excellent con&s;titution of government: A go|vernment in which the prerogative of the &s;overeign and the priviledges of the people are &s;o tempered, that they mutually &s;upport one another&mdash;"A con&s;titution formed on common rea&s;on, common con&s;ent, and common good: A con&s;titution of free and equal laws, &s;ecured again&s;t arbitrary will, and popular licence, by an admirable temperament of the governing powers, controling and controled by one another". The Engli&s;h con&s;titution is not only the pride of Britons, but the envy of its neigh|bors.&mdash;We have al&s;o thro' the goodne&s;s of the Al|mighty, been favoured with Princes, e&s;pecially &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of <HI>Ha|nover,</HI> that have been Guardians of our rights, and Fathers of the people.&mdash;Indeed a renowned Prince of the hou&s;e of <HI>Orange</HI> is not to be forgotten, but ever to be remembered with gratitude, as our Deli|verer from tyranny.</P>

By this happy coincidence of affairs, the reputation, grandeur and pro&s;perity of the nation was never carried to a grea|ter pitch than at this Day.</P>
<P>BUT to bring our views near home, in this Pro|vince;&mdash;We are ble&s;&s;ed with a con&s;titution formed

<P>IT would be going out of my line, if not deemed arrogance, to pretend to point out methods for the regulation or im|provement of Trade:&mdash;Or, by what means our export might be brought to bear a greater proportion to our im|port: But the following Reflections upon Trade in Dr. NEWTON's di&s;&s;ertations upon the prophecies concerning TYRE, may not be unacceptable, or without u&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>TRADE is a fluctuating thing: it pa&s;&s;ed from Tyre to Alex|andria, from Alexandria to Venice, from Venice to An|twerp, from Antwerp to Am&s;terdam, and London; the Engli&s;h rivalling the Dutch, as the French are now ri|valling both. All Nations almo&s;t are wi&s;ely applying them&s;elves to trade; and it behoves tho&s;e who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, to take the greate&s;t care they do not lo&s;e it. It is a plant of tender growth, and requires &s;un and &s;oil and fine &s;ea&s;ons to make it thrive and flouri&s;h. It will not grow like the palm tree, which with the more weight and pre&s;&s;ure ri&s;es the more. Liberty is a friend to that, as that is to liberty. But nothing will &s;upport it more than virtue, and what virtue teacheth, &s;obriety, indu&s;try, frugality, mode&s;ty, hone&s;ty, punctuality, hu|manity, the love of our country, and the fear of God. The prophets will inform us how the Tyreans lo&s;t it; and the like cau&s;es will always produce the like effects.</Q> (I&s;. 23. 8, 9.

<P>I MAY add, The pre&s;ent admini&s;tration of govern|ment is &s;uch as to challenge our e&s;teem, and to de|mand our reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and under which we may account our&s;elves happy.&mdash;If the pri|mitive chri&s;tians were to obey the heathen magi&s;trates, that were in power; the Emperor as &s;upreme, and Governors or procon&s;uls &s;ent by him; is it not then our duty to be loyal to the be&s;t of Kings, and to te&s;ti|fy
