<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with the utmo&s;t diffidence that the following pages are &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pection of the Public: yet, however the limited abilities of the author may have prevented her from &s;ucceeding to her wi&s;h in the execution of her pre&s;ent attempt, &s;he humbly tru&s;ts that the uprightne&s;s of her intention will procure it a candid and favourable reception. The following little E&s;&s;ays are chiefly calculated for the younger part of her own &s;ex, who, &s;he flatters her&s;elf, will not e&s;teem them the le&s;s, becau&s;e they were written im|mediately for their &s;ervice. She by no means pre|tends to have compo&s;ed a regular &s;y&s;tem of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters"> or a fini&s;hed plan of conduct: &s;he has only end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to make a few remarks on &s;uch circum&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eemed to her &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;ome improve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> on &s;uch &s;ubjects as &s;he imagined were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> intere&s;ting to young ladies, on their fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters">|tion into the world. She hopes they will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> offended if &s;he has occa&s;ionally pointed out certain qualities, and &s;ugge&s;ted certain tempers and di&s;|po&s;itions as <HI>peculiarly feminine,</HI> and hazarded &s;ome ob&s;ervations which naturally aro&s;e from the &s;ubject, on the different characters which mark the &s;exes. And here again &s;he takes the liberty to repeat that the&s;e di&s;tinctions cannot be too nicely maintained; for be|&s;ides tho&s;e important qualities common to both, each &s;ex has its re&s;pective, appropriated qualifications, which would cea&s;e to be meritorious, the in&s;tant they cea&s;ed to be appropriated. Nature, propriety, and cu&s;tom have pre&s;cribed certain bounds to each; bounds which the prudent and the candid will never attempt
<PB N="2" REF="019810_0004_0FACB40B49CD6A28">
to break down; and indeed it would be highly im|politic to annihilate di&s;tinctions from which each ac|quires excellence, and to attempt innovations by which both would be lo&s;ers.</P>
<P>WOMEN therefore never under&s;tand their own inte|re&s;ts &s;o little, as when they affect tho&s;e qualities and accompli&s;hments, from the want of which they derive their highe&s;t merit. "The <HI>porcelain</HI> clay of human kind," &s;ays an admired writer, &s;peaking of the &s;ex. Greater delicacy evidently implies greater fragility; and this weakne&s;s, natural and moral, clearly points out the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;uperior degree of caution, re|tirement, and re&s;erve.</P>
<P>IF the author may be allowed to keep up the allu|&s;ion of the poet, ju&s;t quoted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e would a&s;k, if we do not put the fine&s;t va&s;es, and the co&s;tlie&s;t images in places of the greate&s;t &s;ecurity, and mo&s;t remote from any pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ability of accident or de&s;truction? By being &s;o &s;ituated, they find their protection in their weak|ne&s;s, and their &s;afety in their delicacy. This meta|phor is far from being u&s;ed with a de&s;ign of placing young ladies in a trivial, unimportant light; it is only introduced to in&s;inuate, that where there is more beauty, and more weakne&s;s, there &s;hould be greater circum&s;pection and &s;uperior prudence.</P>
<P>MEN, on the contrary, are formed for the more public exhibitions on the great theatre of human life. Like the &s;tronger and more &s;ub&s;tantial wares, they de|rive no injury, and lo&s;e no poli&s;h by being always ex|po&s;ed, and engaged in the con&s;tant commerce of the world. It is their proper element, where they re&s;pire their natural air, and exert their noble&s;t powers, in &s;ituations which call them into action. They were intended by Providence for the bu&s;tling &s;cenes of life; to appear terrible in arms, u&s;eful in commerce, &s;hining in coun&s;els.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="019810_0005_0FACB40C481179B8">
THE author fears it will be hazarding a very bold remark, in the opinion of many ladies, when &s;he adds, that the female mind in general, does not appear capa|ble of attaining &s;o high a degree of perfection in &s;cience as the male. Yet &s;he hopes to be forgiven when &s;he ob&s;erves al&s;o, that as it does not &s;eem to derive the chief portion of its excellence from extraordin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|lities of this kind, it is not at all le&s;&s;ened by the impu|tation of not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them. It is readily allowed, that the &s;ex have lively imaginations, and tho&s;e exqui|&s;ite perceptions of the beautiful and defective, which come under the denomination of Ta&s;te. But preten|&s;ions to that &s;trength of intellect, which is requi&s;ite to penetrate into the ab&s;tru&s;er walks of literature, it is pre&s;umed they will readily relinqui&s;h. There are green pa&s;tures, and plea&s;ant vallies, where they may wan|der with &s;afety to them&s;elves, and delight to others. They may cultivate the ro&s;es of imagination, and the valuable fruits of morals and critici&s;m; but the &s;teeps of Parna&s;&s;us few, comparatively, have attempted to &s;cale with &s;ucce&s;s. And when it is con&s;idered, that many languages, and many &s;ciences, mu&s;t contribute to the perfection of poetical compo&s;ition, it will ap|pear le&s;s &s;trange. The lofty Epic, the pointed Sa|tire, and the more daring and &s;ucce&s;sful flights of the Tragic Mu&s;e, &s;eem re&s;erved for the bold adven|turers of the other &s;ex.</P>
<P>NOR does this a&s;&s;ertion, it is apprehended, at all injure the intere&s;ts of the women; they have other preten&s;ions, on which to value them&s;elves, and other qualities much better calculated to an&s;wer their par|ticular purpo&s;es. We are enamoured of the &s;oft &s;trains of the Sicilian and the Mantuan Mu&s;e, while, to the &s;weet notes of the pa&s;toral reed, they &s;ing the Con|tentions of the Shepherds, the Ble&s;&s;ings of Love, or the innocent Delights of rural Life. Has it ever been a&s;cribed to them as a defect, that their Eclogues
<PB N="4" REF="019810_0006_0FACB40D0396DA90">
do not treat of active &s;cenes, of bu&s;y cities, and of wa&s;ting war? No: their &s;implicity is their perfection, and they are only blamed when they have too little of it.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the lofty bards who &s;trung their bolder harps to higher mea&s;ures, and &s;ung the <HI>Wrath</HI> of <HI>Peleus' Son,</HI> and <HI>Man's fir&s;t Di&s;obedience,</HI> have never been cen&s;ured for want of &s;weetne&s;s and refinement. The &s;ublime, the nervous, and the ma&s;|culine, characteri&s;e their compo&s;itions; as the beau|tiful, the &s;oft, and the delicate, mark tho&s;e of the o|thers. Grandeur, dignity, and force, di&s;tingui&s;h the one &s;pecies; ea&s;e, &s;implicity, and purity the other. Both &s;hine from their native, di&s;tinct, unborrowed merits, not from tho&s;e which are foreign, adventitious, and unnatural. Yet tho&s;e excellencies, which make up the e&s;&s;ential and con&s;tituent parts of poetry, they have in common.</P>
<P>WOMEN have generally quicker preceptions: men have ju&s;ter &s;entiments.&mdash;Women con&s;ider how things may be prettily &s;aid; men how they may be properly &s;aid.&mdash;In women, (young ones at lea&s;t) &s;peaking accompanies, and &s;ometimes precedes reflection; in men, reflection is the antecedent.&mdash;Women &s;peak to &s;hine or to plea&s;e; men, to convince or confute.&mdash;Women admire what is brilliant; men what is &s;olid.&mdash;Women prefer an extemporaneous &s;ally of wit, or a &s;parkling effu&s;ion of fancy, before the mo&s;t accu|rate rea&s;oning, or the mo&s;t laborious inve&s;tigation of facts. In literary compo&s;ition, women are plea&s;ed with point, turn, and antithe&s;is; men with ob&s;ervation, and a ju&s;t deduction of effects from their cau&s;es.&mdash;Women are fond of incident, men of argument.&mdash;Women admire pa&s;&s;ionately, men approve cautiou&s;ly.&mdash;One &s;ex will think it betrays a want of feeling to be moderate in their applau&s;e, the other will be afraid of expo&s;ing a want of judgment by being in raptures
<PB N="5" REF="019810_0007_0FACB40DE958ABC8">
with any thing.&mdash;Men refu&s;e to give way to the emo|tions they actually feel, while women &s;ometimes af|fect to be tran&s;ported beyond what the occa&s;ion will ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>As a farther confirmation of what has been advan|ced on the different bent of the under&s;tanding in the &s;exes, it may be ob&s;erved, that we have heard of many female wits, but never of one female logician&mdash;of many admirable writers of memoirs, but never of one chronologer.&mdash;In the boundle&s;s and aerial regions of romance, and in that fa&s;hionable &s;pecies of compo&s;ition which &s;ucceded it, and which carries a nearer approx|imation to the manners of the world, the women can|not be excelled: this imaginary &s;oil they have a pe|culiar talent for cultivating, becau&s;e here,
<Q>Invention labours more, and judgment le&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>THE merit of this kind of writing con&s;i&s;ts in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rai&s;emblance</HI> to real life as to the events them&s;elves, with a certain elevation in the narrative, which places them, if not above what is natural, yet above what is common. It farther con&s;i&s;ts in the art of intere&s;ting the tender feelings by a pathetic repre&s;entation of tho&s;e minute, endearing, dome&s;tic circum&s;tances, which take captive the &s;oul before it has time to &s;hield it&s;elf with the armour of reflection. To amu&s;e, rather than to in&s;truct, or to in&s;truct indirectly by &s;hort inferences, drawn from a long concatenation of circum&s;tances, is at once the bu&s;ine&s;s of this &s;ort of compo&s;ition, and one of the characteri&s;tics of female genius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE author does not apprehend it makes again&s;t her GE|NERAL po&s;ition, that this nation can boa&s;t a female critic, poet, hi&s;torian, lingui&s;t, philo&s;opher, and morali&s;t, equal to mo&s;t of the other &s;ex. To the&s;e particular in&s;tances others might be adduced; but it is pre&s;umed, that they only &s;tand as exceptions again&s;t the rule, without tending to invalidate the rule it&s;elf.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="019810_0008_0FACB40E8CBC25A8">
IN &s;hort, it appears that the mind in each &s;ex has &s;ome natural kind of bias, which con&s;titutes a di&s;tinc|tion of character, and that the happine&s;s of both de|pends, in a great mea&s;ure, on the pre&s;ervation and ob|&s;ervance of this di&s;tinction. For where would be the &s;uperior plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction re&s;ulting from mixed conver&s;ation, if this difference were aboli&s;hed? If the qualities of both were invariably and exactly the &s;ame, no benefit or entertainment would ari&s;e from the tedious and in&s;ipid uniformity of &s;uch an intercour&s;e; whereas con&s;iderable advantages are reaped from a &s;e|lect &s;ociety of both &s;exes. The rough angles and a&s;|perities of male manners are imperceptibly filed, and gradually worn &s;mooth, by the poli&s;hing of female con|ver&s;ation, and the refining of female ta&s;te; while the ideas of women acquire &s;trength and &s;olidity, by their a&s;&s;ociating with &s;en&s;ible, intelligent, and judicious men.</P>
<P>ON the whole, (even if fame be the object of pur|&s;uit) is it not better to &s;ucceed as women, than to fail as men? To &s;hine, by walking honourably in the road which nature, cu&s;tom, and education &s;eem to have marked out, rather than to counteract them all, by moving awkwardly in a path diametrically oppo&s;ite? To be good originals, rather than bad imitators? In a word, to be excellent women, rather than indiffe|rent men?</P>

<P>AS an argument in favour of modern manners, it has has been pleaded, that the &s;ofter vices of Luxury and Di&s;&s;ipation, belong rather to gentle and yielding tempers, than to &s;uch as are rugged and ferocious: that they are vices which increa&s;e civilization, and tend to promote refinement, and the cultivation of humanity.</P>
<P>BUT this is an a&s;&s;ertion, the truth of which the ex|perience of all ages contradicts. Nero was not le&s;s a tyrant for being a &s;idler; He<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Emperor Caligula.</NOTE> who wi&s;hed the whole Roman people had but one neck, that he might di&s;patch them at a blow, was him&s;elf the mo&s;t debauched man in Rome; and Sydney and Ru&s;&s;el were condemned to bleed under the mo&s;t barbarous, though mo&s;t di&s;&s;ipated and voluptuous, reign that ever di&s;graced the annals of Britain.</P>
<P>THE love of di&s;&s;ipation is, I believe, allowed to be the reigning evil of the pre&s;ent day. It is an evil which many content them&s;elves with regretting, with|out &s;eeking to redre&s;s. A di&s;&s;ipated life is cen&s;ured
<PB N="8" REF="019810_0010_0FACB40FD4C707E0">
in the very act of di&s;&s;ipation, and prodigality of time is as gravely declaimed again&s;t at the card table, as in the pulpit.</P>
<P>THE lover of dancing cen&s;ures the amu&s;ements of the theatre for their dulne&s;s, and the game&s;ter blames them both for their levity. She, who&s;e whole &s;oul is &s;wallowed up in <HI>"opera extacies,"</HI> is a&s;toni&s;hed, that her acquaintance can &s;pend whole nights in preying, like harpies, on the fortunes of their fellow-creatures; while the grave &s;ober &s;inner, who pa&s;&s;es her pale and anxious vigils, in this fa&s;hionable &s;ort of pillaging, is no le&s;s &s;urprized how the other can wa&s;te her precious time in hearing &s;ounds for which &s;he has no ta&s;te, in a language &s;he does not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, every one &s;eems convinced, that the evil &s;o much complained of does really exi&s;t &s;omewhere, though all are inwardly per&s;uaded that it is not with them&s;elves. All de&s;ire a general reformation, but few will li&s;ten to propo&s;als of particular amendment; the body mu&s;t be re&s;tored, but each limb begs to remain as it is; and accu&s;ations which concern all, will be likely to affect none. They think that &s;in, like mat|ter, is divi&s;ible, and that what is &s;cattered among &s;o many, cannot materially affect any one; and thus in|dividuals contribute &s;eparately to that evil which they in general lament.</P>
<P>THE prevailing manners of an age depend more than we are aware, or are willing to allow, on the conduct of the women; this is one of the principal hinges on which the great machine of human &s;ociety turns. Tho&s;e who allow the influence which female graces have, in contributing to poli&s;h the manners of men, would do well to reflect how great an influence female morals mu&s;t al&s;o have on their conduct. How much then is it to be regretted, that the Briti&s;h la|dies &s;hould ever &s;it down contented to poli&s;h, when they are able to reform, to entertain, when they
<PB N="9" REF="019810_0011_0FACB412B67D0538">
might in&s;truct, and to dazzle for an hour, when they are candidates for eternity!</P>
<P>UNDER the di&s;pen&s;ation of Mahomet's law, in|deed, the&s;e mental excellencies cannot be expected, becau&s;e the women are &s;hut out from all opportunities of in&s;truction, and excluded from the endearing plea|&s;ures of a delightful and equal &s;ociety; and, as a charming poet &s;ings, are taught to believe, that
<Q><L>For their inferior natures</L>

<L>Heav'n has re&s;erv'd no future paradi&s;e,</L>

<L>Of total death, and carele&s;s of hereafter.&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>IRENE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THESE act con&s;i&s;tently in &s;tudying none but exte|rior graces, in cultivating only per&s;onal attractions, and in trying to lighten the intolerable burden of time, by the mo&s;t frivolous and vain amu&s;ements. They act in con&s;equence of their own blind belief, and the tyranny of their de&s;potic ma&s;ters; for they have neither the freedom of a pre&s;ent choice, nor the pro&s;pect of a future being.</P>
<P>BUT in this land of civil and religious liberty, where there is as little de&s;poti&s;m exerci&s;ed over the minds as over the per&s;ons of women, they have every liberty of choice, and every opportunity of improvement; and how greatly does this increa&s;e their obligation to be exemplary in their general conduct, attentive to the government of their families, and in&s;trumental to the good order of &s;ociety!</P>
<P>SHE who is at a lo&s;s to find amu&s;ements at home, can no longer apologize for her di&s;&s;ipation abroad, by &s;aying &s;he is deprived of the benefit and the plea&s;ure of books: and &s;he who regrets being doomed to a &s;tate of dark and gloomy ignorance, by the inju&s;tice, or tyranny of the men, complains of an evil which does not exi&s;t.</P>

IT it a que&s;tion frequently in the mouths of illite|rate and di&s;&s;ipated females&mdash;"What good is there in reading? To what end does it conduce?" It is, how|ever, too obvious to need in&s;i&s;ting on, that unle&s;s per|verted, as the be&s;t things may be, reading an&s;wers many excellent purpo&s;es be&s;ides the great leading one, and is perhaps the &s;afe&s;t remedy for di&s;&s;ipation. She who dedicates a portion of her lei&s;ure to u&s;eful read|ing, feels her mind in a con&s;tant progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate of improvement, whil&s;t the mind of a di&s;&s;ipated woman is continually lo&s;ing ground. An active &s;pirit rejoiceth, like the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">un, to run his daily cour&s;e, while indolence, like the dial of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">az, goes backwards. The advan|tages which the under&s;tanding receives from polite li|terature, it is not here nece&s;&s;ary to en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">merate; its ef|fects on the moral temper is the pre&s;ent object of con&s;ide|ration. The remark may perhaps be thought too &s;trong, but I believe it is true, that next to religious influ|ences, an habit of &s;tudy is the mo&s;t probable pre&s;erva|tive of the virtue of young per&s;ons. Tho&s;e who cul|tivate letters have rarely a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for promi&s;|cuous vi&s;iting, or di&s;&s;ipated &s;ociety; &s;tudy therefore induces a reli&s;h for dome&s;tic life, the mo&s;t de&s;irable temper in the world for women. Study, as it re&s;cues the mind from an inordinate fondne&s;s for gaming, dre&s;s, and public amu&s;ements, is an oeconomical pro|pen&s;ity; for a lady may read at much le&s;s expence than &s;he can play at cards; as it requires &s;ome appli|cation, it gives the mind an habit of indu&s;try; as it is a relief again&s;t that mental di&s;ea&s;e, which the French emphatically call <HI>ennui,</HI> it cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ail of be|ing beneficial to the temper and &s;pirits, I mean in the moderate degree in which ladies are &s;uppo&s;ed to u&s;e it; as an enemy to indolence, it becomes a &s;ocial vir|tue; as it demands the full exertion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of our talents, it grows a rational duty; and when directed to the

knowledge of the Supreme Being, and his laws, it ri&s;es into an act of religion.</P>
<P>The rage for reformation commonly &s;hews it&s;elf in a violent zeal for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing what is wrong, rather than a prudent attention to e&s;tabli&s;h what is right; but we &s;hall never obtain a fair garden merely by rooting up weeds, we mu&s;t al&s;o plant flowers; for the natural richne&s;s of the &s;oil we have been clearing will not &s;uffer it to lie barren, but whether it &s;hall be vain|ly or beneficially prolific, depends on the culture. What the pre&s;ent age has gained on one &s;ide, by a more enlarged and liberal way of thinking, &s;eems to be lo&s;t on the other, by exce&s;&s;ive freedom and un|bounded indulgence. Knowledge is not, as hereto|fore, confined to the dull cloy&s;ter, or the gloomy college, but di&s;&s;eminated, to a certain degree, among both &s;exes and almo&s;t all ranks. The only misfor|tune is, that the&s;e opportunities do not &s;eem to be &s;o wi&s;ely improved, or turned to &s;o good an account as might be wi&s;hed. Books of a pernicious, idle, and frivolous &s;ort, are too much multiplied, and it is from the very redundancy of them that true knowledge is &s;o &s;carce, and the habit of di&s;&s;ipation &s;o much in|crea&s;ed.</P>
<P>IT has been remarked, that the prevailing charac|ter of the pre&s;ent age is not that of gro&s;s immorality: but if this is meant of tho&s;e in the higher walks of life, it is ea&s;y to di&s;cern, that there can be but little merit in ab&s;taining from crimes which there is but little temptation to commit. It is, however, to be feared, that a gradual defection from piety, will in time draw after it all the bad con&s;equences of more active vice; for whether mounds and fences are &s;ud|denly de&s;troyed by a &s;weeping torrent, or worn away through gradual neglect, the effect is equally de&s;truc|tive. As a rapid fever and a con&s;uming hectic are a|like fatal to our natural health, &s;o are flagrant im|morality

and torpid indolence to our moral well being.</P>
<P>THE philo&s;ophical doctrine of the &s;low rece&s;&s;ion of bodies from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">un, is a lively image of the reluc|tance with which we fir&s;t abandon the light of vir|tue. The beginning of folly, and the fir&s;t entrance on a di&s;&s;ipated life, co&s;t &s;ome pangs to a well di&s;po&s;ed heart; but it is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee how &s;oon the pro|gre&s;s cea&s;es to be impeded by reflection, or &s;lackened by remor&s;e. For it is in moral as in natural things, the motion in minds as well as bodies is accelerated by a nearer approach to the centre to which they are tending. If we recede &s;lowly at fir&s;t &s;etting out, we advance rapidly in our future cour&s;e; and to have begun to be wrong, is already to have made a great progre&s;s.</P>
<P>A CONSTANT habit of amu&s;ement relaxes the tone of the mind, and renders it totally incapable of appli|cation, &s;tudy, or virtue. Di&s;&s;ipation not only indi&s;|po&s;es its votaries to every thing u&s;eful and excellent, but di&s;qualifies them for the enjoyment of plea&s;ure it|&s;elf. It &s;oftens the &s;oul &s;o much, that the mo&s;t &s;u|perficial employment becomes a labour, and the &s;light|e&s;t inconvenience an agony. The luxurious Sybarite mu&s;t have lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of real enjoyment, and all re|li&s;h for true gratification, before he complained that he could not &s;leep, becau&s;e the ro&s;e leaves lay double under him.</P>
<P>LUXURY and di&s;&s;ipation, &s;oft and gentle as their approaches are, and &s;ilently as they throw their &s;ilken chains about the heart, en&s;lave it more than the mo&s;t active and turbulent vices. The mightie&s;t conquerors have been conquered by tho&s;e unarmed foes: the flowery &s;etters are fa&s;tened, before they are felt. The blandi&s;hments of Circe were more fatal to the mari|ners of Uly&s;&s;es, than the &s;trength of Polypheme, or the brutality of the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;trigons.

<P>BEFORE the hero of the mo&s;t beautiful and vir|tuous romance that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ver was written, I mean Tele|machus, landed on the i&s;land of Cyprus, he unfortu|nately lo&s;t his prudent companion, Mentor, in whom wi&s;dom is &s;o finely per&s;onified.

In &s;hort, he had cea&s;ed to love virtue long before he thought of committing actual vice; and the duties of a manly piety were burden&s;ome to him, before he was &s;o deba&s;ed as to offer perfumes, and burn incen&s;e on the altar of the licentious godde&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing can be more admirable than the manner in which this allegory is conducted; and the whole work, not to men|tion it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> images, machinery, and other poetical beauties, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the very fine&s;t &s;train of morality.

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been advi&s;ed, and by very re&s;pectable autho|rities too, that in conver&s;ation women &s;hould careful|ly conceal any knowledge or learning they may hap|pen to po&s;&s;e&s;s. I own, with &s;ubm&s;&s;ion, that I do not &s;ee either the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety of this advice. For if a young lady has that di&s;cretion and mode&s;ty, without which all knowledge is little worth, &s;he will never make an o&s;tentatious parade of it, becau&s;e &s;he will rather be intent on acquiring more, then on di&s;|playing what &s;he has.</P>
<P>I AM at a lo&s;s to know why a young female is in&s;tructed to exhibit, in the mo&s;t advantageous point of view, her &s;kill in mu&s;ic, her &s;inging, dancing, ta&s;te in dre&s;s, and her acquaintance with the mo&s;t fa&s;hiona|ble games and amu&s;ements, while her piety is to be anxiou&s;ly concealed, and her knowledge affectedly di&s;|avowed, le&s;t the former &s;hould draw on her the ap|pellation of an enthu&s;ia&s;t, or the latter that of a pedant.</P>
<P>IN regard to knowledge, why &s;hould &s;he for ever affect to be on her guard, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be found guilty of a &s;mall portion of it? She need be the le&s;s &s;olicitous about it, as it &s;eldom proves to be &s;o very

con&s;iderable as to excite a&s;toni&s;hment or admiration: for, after all the acqui&s;itions which her talents and her &s;tudies have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her to make, &s;he will, gene|rally &s;peaking, be found to have le&s;s of what is called <HI>learning,</HI> than a common &s;chool-boy.</P>
<P>IT would be to the la&s;t degree pre&s;umptuous and ab&s;urd, for a young woman to pretend to give the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n</HI> to the company; to interrupt the plea&s;ure of others, and her own opportunity of improvement, by talking when &s;he ought to li&s;ten; or to introduce &s;ubjects out of the common road, in order to &s;hew her own wit, or expo&s;e the want of it in others: but were the &s;ex to be totally &s;ilent when any topic of literature hap|pens to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in their pre&s;ence, conver&s;ation would lo&s;e much of vivacity, and &s;ociety would be robbed of one of its mo&s;t intere&s;ting charms.</P>
<P>How ea&s;ily and effectually may a well-br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d woman promote the mo&s;t u&s;eful and elegant conver&s;ation, al|mo&s;t without &s;peaking a word! for the modes of &s;peech are &s;carcely more variable then the modes of &s;ilence. The &s;ilence of li&s;tle&s;s ignorance, and the &s;ilence of &s;parkling intelligence, are perhaps as &s;epa|rately marked, and as di&s;tinctly expre&s;&s;ed, as the &s;ame feelings could have been by the mo&s;t unequivocal lan|guage. A woman, in a company where &s;he has the lea&s;t influence, may promote any &s;ubject by a pro|found and invariable attention, which &s;hews that &s;he is plea&s;ed with it, and by an illuminated countenance, which proves &s;he under&s;tands it.

or whi&s;pering of &s;illy girls, who&s;e wearine&s;s betrays their ignorance, and who&s;e impatience expo&s;es their ill-breeding. A polite man, however deeply intere&s;t|ed in the &s;ubject on which he is conver&s;ing, catches at the &s;lighte&s;t hint to have done: a look is a &s;ufficient intimation, and if a pretty &s;impleton, who &s;its near him, &s;eems <HI>di&s;traite,</HI> he puts an end to his remarks, to the great regret of the rea&s;onable part of the company, who perhaps might have gained more improvement by the continuance of &s;uch a conver&s;ation, than a week's reading would have yielded them; for it is &s;uch com|pany as this, that give an edge to each other's wit, "as iron &s;harpeneth iron."</P>
<P>THAT &s;ilence is one of the great arts of conver&s;ation is allowed by Cicero him&s;elf, who &s;ays, there is not only an art but even an eloquence in it. And this opinion is confirmed by a great modern<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Bacon.</NOTE>, in the fol|lowing little anecdote from one of the ancients:</P>
<P>WHEN many Grecian philo&s;ophers had a &s;olemn meeting before the amba&s;&s;ador of a foreign prince, each endeavoured to &s;hew his parts by the brilliancy of his conver&s;ation, that the amba&s;&s;ador might have &s;omething to relate of the Grecian wi&s;dom. One of them, offended, no doubt, at the loquacity of his companions, ob&s;erved a profound &s;ilence; when the amba&s;&s;ador, turning to him, a&s;ked, <Q>But what have you to &s;ay, that I may report it?</Q> He made this laconic, but very pointed reply: <Q>Tell your king that you have found one among the Greeks who knew how to be &s;ilent.</Q></P>
<P>THERE is a quality infinitely more intoxicating to the female mind than knowledge&mdash;this is Wit, the mo&s;t captivating, but the mo&s;t dreaded of all talents: the mo&s;t dangerous to tho&s;e who have it, and the mo&s;t feared by tho&s;e who have it not. Though it is again&s;t all the rules, yet I cannot find in my heart to abu&s;e this charming quality. He who is grown rich with|out

it, in &s;afe and &s;ober dulne&s;s, &s;huns it as a di&s;ea&s;e, and looks upon poverty as its invariable concomitant. The morali&s;t declaims again&s;t it as the &s;ource of irregu|larity, and the frugal citizen dreads it more than bank|ruptcy it&s;elf, for he con&s;iders it as the parent of extra|vagance and beggary. The Cynic will a&s;k of what u&s;e it is? Of very little perhaps: no more is a flower gar|den, and yet it is allowed as an object of innocent amu&s;ement and delightful recreation. A woman, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this quality, has received a mo&s;t danger|ous pre&s;ent, perhaps not le&s;s &s;o than beauty it&s;elf: e&s;pecially if it be not &s;heathed in a temper peculiarly inoffen&s;ive, cha&s;ti&s;ed by a mo&s;t correct judgment, and re&s;trained by more prudence than falls to the common lot.</P>
<P>THIS talent is more likely to make a woman vain than knowledge; for as Wit is the immediate property of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and learning is only an acquaintance with the knowledge of other people, there is much more danger, that we &s;hould be vain of what is our own, than of what we borrow.</P>
<P>BUT Wit, like learning, is not near &s;o common a thing as is imagined. Let not therefore a young la|dy be alarmed at the acutene&s;s of her own wit, any more than at the abundance of her own knowledge. The great danger is, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould mi&s;take pertne&s;s, flippancy, or imprudence, for this brilliant quality, or imagine &s;he is witty, only becau&s;e &s;he is indi&s;creet. This is very frequently the ca&s;e, and this makes the name of wit &s;o cheap, while its real exi&s;tence is &s;o rare.</P>
<P>LEST the flattery of her acquaintance, or an over|weening opinion of her own qualifications, &s;hould lead &s;ome vain and petulant girl into a fal&s;e notion that &s;he has a great deal of wit, when &s;he has only a redundancy of animal &s;pirits, &s;he may not find it u&s;e|le&s;s to attend to the definition of this quality, by one

<P>BUT tho&s;e who actually po&s;&s;e&s;s this rare talent, cannot be too ab&s;tinent in the u&s;e of it.

She who does not de&s;ire friends has a &s;ordid and in&s;en&s;ible &s;oul; but &s;he who is ambitious of making every man her admirer, has an invincible vanity, and a cold heart.</P>
<P>BUT to dwell only on the &s;ide of policy, a prudent woman, who has e&s;tabli&s;hed the reputation of &s;ome genius, will &s;ufficiently maintain it, without keeping her faculties always on the &s;tretch to &s;ay <HI>good things.</HI> Nay, if reputation alone be her object, &s;he will gain a more &s;olid one by her forbearance, as the wi&s;er part of her acquaintance will a&s;cribe it to the right motive, which is, not that &s;he has le&s;s wit, but that &s;he has more judgment.</P>

<P>IN a &s;en&s;ible company of both &s;exes, where women are not re&s;trained by any other re&s;erve than what their natural mode&s;ty impo&s;es; and where the intimacy of all parties authori&s;es the utmo&s;t freedom of communi|cation; &s;hould any one inquire what were the general &s;entiments on &s;ome particular &s;ubject, it will, I be|lieve, commonly happen that the ladies who&s;e imagi|nations have kept pace with the narration, have anti|cipated its end, and are ready to deliver their &s;enti|ments on it, as &s;oon as it is fini&s;hed.

the con&s;i&s;tencies of what was &s;aid, are obliged to pau&s;e and di&s;criminate, before they think of an|&s;wering.

<P>A MAN of deep reflection, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> does not keep up an intimate commerce with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld, will be &s;ome|times &s;o entangled in the intricacies of inten&s;e thought, that he will have the appearance of a confu&s;ed and perplexed expre&s;&s;ion; while a &s;prightly woman will extricate her&s;elf with that lively and "ra&s;h dexterity," which will almo&s;t always plea&s;e, though it is very far from being always right. It is ea&s;ier to confound than to convince an opponent; the former may be effected by a turn that has more happine&s;s than truth in it. Many an excellent rea&s;oner, well &s;killed in the theory of the &s;chools, has felt him&s;elf di&s;com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itted by a reply, which, though as wide of the mark, and as foreign to the que&s;tion as can be conceived, has di&s;|concerted him more than the mo&s;t &s;tartling propo&s;iti|on, or the mo&s;t accurate chain of rea&s;oning could have done; and he has borne the laugh of his fair antago|ni&s;t, as well as of the whole company, though he could not but feel, that his own argument was attended with the fulle&s;t demon&s;tration: &s;o true it is, that it is not always nece&s;&s;ary to be right in order to be applauded.</P>
<P>BUT let not a young lady's vanity be too much elated with this fal&s;e applau&s;e, which is given, not to merit, but to her &s;ex: &s;he has not perhaps gained a victory, though &s;he may be allowed a triumph; and it &s;hould humble her to reflect, that the tribute is paid, not to her &s;trength but to her weakne&s;s. It is worth while to di&s;criminate between that applau&s;e, which is given from the complai&s;ance of others, and that which is paid to our own merit.</P>

to a cu&s;tom of ob&s;erving, thinking, and rea&s;on|ing. I do not mean that they &s;hould devote them|&s;elves to ab&s;tru&s;e &s;peculation, or the &s;tudy of logic; but &s;he who is accu&s;tomed to give a due arrangement to her thoughts, to rea&s;on ju&s;tly and pertinently on common affairs, and judiciou&s;ly to deduce effects from their cau&s;es, will be a better logician than &s;ome of tho&s;e who claim the name, becau&s;e they have &s;tudied the art: this is being "learned without the rules;" the be&s;t definition, perhaps, of that &s;ort of literature which is propere&s;t for the &s;ex. That &s;pecies of know|ledge, which appears to be the re&s;ult of reflection rather than of &s;cience, &s;its peculiarly well on wo|men. It is not uncommon to find a lady, who, though &s;he does not know a rule of Syntax, &s;carcely ever vio|lates one; and who con&s;tructs every &s;entence &s;he ut|ters, with more propriety than many a learned dunce, who has every rule of Ari&s;totle by heart, and who can lace his own thread-bare di&s;cour&s;e with the golden &s;hreds of Cicero and Virgil.</P>
<P>IT has been objected, and I fear with &s;ome rea&s;on, that female conver&s;ation is too frequently tinctured with a cen&s;orious &s;pirit, and that ladies are &s;eldom apt to di&s;cover much tenderne&s;s for the errors of a fallen &s;i&s;ter.
<Q>If it be &s;o, it is a grievous fault.</Q>
No arguments can ju&s;tify, no pleas can extenuate it. To in&s;ult over the mi&s;eries of an unhappy creature is inhuman, not to compa&s;&s;ionate them is unchri&s;tian. The worthy part of the &s;ex always expre&s;s them&s;elves humanely on the failings of others, in proportion to their own undeviating goodne&s;s.</P>

of indi&s;criminate applau&s;e. This proceeds from the fal&s;e idea they entertain, that the direct contrary to what is wrong mu&s;t be right. Thus the dread of being only &s;u&s;pected of one fault makes them actually guilty of another. The de&s;ire of avoiding the imputa|tion of envy, impels them to be in&s;incere; and to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a reputation for &s;weetne&s;s of temper and genero|&s;ity, they affect &s;ometimes to &s;peak of very indifferent characters with the mo&s;t extravagant applau&s;e.

<P>TO <HI>hint at a fault,</HI> does more mi&s;chief than &s;peak|ing out; for whatever is left for the imagination to fini&s;h, will not fail to be overdone: every haitus will be more than filled up, and every pau&s;e more than &s;up|plied. There is le&s;s malice, and le&s;s mi&s;chief too, in telling a man's name than the initials of it; as a wor|thier per&s;on may be involved in the mo&s;t di&s;graceful &s;u&s;picions by &s;uch a dangerous ambiguity.</P>
<P>IT is not uncommon for the envious, after having attempted to deface the faire&s;t character &s;o indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly, that they are afraid you will begin to detect their malice, to endeavour to remove your &s;u&s;picions effectually, by a&s;&s;uring you, that what they have ju&s;t related is only the popular opinion; they them|&s;elves can never believe things are &s;o bad as they are &s;aid to be; for their part it is a rule with them al|ways to hope the be&s;t. It is their way never to be|lieve or report ill of any one. They will, however, mention the &s;tory in all companies, that they may do their friend the &s;ervices of prote&s;ting their di&s;belief of it. More reputations are thus hinted away by fal&s;e friends, than are openly de&s;troyed by public enemies. An <HI>if,</HI> or a <HI>but,</HI> or a mortified look, or a languid de|fence, or an ambiguous &s;hake of the head, or a ha&s;ty word affectedly recalled, will demoli&s;h a character more effectually, than the whole artillery of malice when openly levelled again&s;t it.</P>
<P>IT is not that envy never prai&s;es&mdash;No, that would be making a public profe&s;&s;ion of it&s;elf, and adverti&s;|ing its own malignity; whereas the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s of its efforts depends on the concealment of their end. When envy intends to &s;trike a &s;troke of Machiaveli|an policy, it &s;ometimes affects the language of the mo&s;t exaggerated applau&s;e; though it generally takes care, that the &s;ubject of its panegyric &s;hall be a very

indifferent and common character, &s;o that it is well a|ware none of its prai&s;es will &s;tick.</P>
<P>IT is the unhappy nature of envy not to be content|ed with po&s;itive mi&s;ery, but to be continually aggra|vating its own torments, by comparing them with the felicities of others. The eyes of envy are perpe|tually fixed on the object which di&s;turbs it, nor can it avert them from it, though to procure it&s;elf the relief of a temporary forgetfulne&s;s.

<P>AS this enormous &s;in chiefly in&s;tigated the revolt, and brought on the ruin of the angelic &s;pirits, &s;o it is not improbable, that it will be a principal in&s;trument of mi&s;ery in a future world, for the envious to com|pare their de&s;perate condition with the happine&s;s of the children of God; and to heighten their actual wretchedne&s;s by reflecting on what they have lo&s;t.</P>

<P>AMONG the many evils which prevail under the &s;un, the abu&s;e of words is not the lea&s;t con&s;ider|able.

Sentiment is the varni&s;h of virtue to conceal the deformity of vice; and it is not uncommon for the &s;ame per&s;ons to make a je&s;t of religion, to break through the mo&s;t &s;olemn ties and engagements, to practi&s;e every art of latent fraud and open &s;eduction, and yet to value them&s;elves on &s;peaking and writing <HI>&s;entimentally.</HI></P>

<P>ERROR is never likely to do &s;o much mi&s;chief as when it di&s;gui&s;es its real tendency, and puts on an engaging and attractive appearance. Many a young woman, who would be &s;hocked at the imputation of an intrigue, is extremely flattered at the idea of a &s;entimental con|nexion, though perhaps with a dangerous and de&s;ign|ing man, who, by putting on this ma&s;k of plau&s;ibility and virtue, di&s;arms her of her prudence, lays her ap|prehen&s;ions a&s;leep, and involves her in mi&s;ery; mi&s;ery the more inevitable becau&s;e un&s;u&s;pected. For &s;he who apprehends no danger, will not think it nece&s;&s;ary to be always upon her guard; but will rather invite than avoid the ruin which comes under &s;o &s;pecious and &s;o fair a form.</P>
<P>SUCH an engagement will be infinitely dearer to her vanity than an avowed and authori&s;ed attachment; for one of the&s;e &s;entimental lovers will not &s;cruple very &s;eriou&s;ly to a&s;&s;ure a credulous girl, that her un|paralleled merit entitles her to the adoration of the whole, world, and that the univer&s;al homage of man|kind is nothing more than the unavoidable tribute ex|torted by her charms. No wonder then &s;he &s;hould be &s;o ea&s;ily prevailed on to believe, that an individual is captivated by perfections which might en&s;lave a mil|lion. But &s;he &s;hould remember, that he who endea|vours to intoxicate her with adulation, intends one day mo&s;t effectually to humble her. For an artful man has always a &s;ecret de&s;ign to pay him&s;elf in future for every pre&s;ent &s;acrifice.

<Q>An angel call'd, and angel-like ador'd,</Q>
is &s;hocked to find her&s;elf at once &s;tripped of all her ce|le&s;tial attributes. This late divinity, who &s;carcely yielded to her &s;i&s;ters of the &s;ky, now finds here&s;elf of le&s;s importance in the e&s;teem of the man &s;he has cho&s;en, than any other mere mortal woman. No longer is &s;he gratified with the tear of counterfeited pa&s;&s;ion, the &s;igh of di&s;&s;embled rapture, or the language of pre|meditated adoration. No longer is the altar of her va|nity loaded with the oblations of fictitious fondne&s;s, the incen&s;e of fal&s;ehood, or the &s;acrifice of flattery.&mdash;Her apotheo&s;is is ended!&mdash;She feels her&s;elf degrad|ed from the dignities and privileges of a godde&s;s, to all the imperfections, vanities, and weakne&s;&s;es of a &s;light|ed woman, and a neglected wife. Her faults which were &s;o lately overlooked, or mi&s;taken for virtues, are now, as Ca&s;&s;ius &s;ays, &s;et in a note-book. The pa&s;|&s;ion, which was vowed eternal, la&s;ted only a few &s;hort weeks; and the indifference, which was &s;o far from being included in the bargain, that it was not &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected, follows them through the whole tire&s;ome journey of their in&s;ipid, vacant, joyle&s;s exi&s;t|ence.</P>
<P>THUS much for the <HI>completion</HI> of the &s;entimental hi&s;tory. If we trace it back to its beginning, we &s;hall find that a dam&s;el of this ca&s;t had her head ori|ginally turned by pernicious reading, and her in&s;anity confirmed by imprudent friend&s;hips. She never fails to &s;elect a beloved <HI>confidante</HI> of her own turn and hu|mour, though, if &s;he can help it, not quite &s;o hand&s;ome as her&s;elf.

though they live in the &s;ame &s;treet, or perhaps in the &s;ame hou&s;e. This is the fuel which principally feeds and &s;upplies the dangerous flame of &s;entiment. In this corre&s;pondence the two friends encourage each other in the fal&s;e&s;t notions imaginable They repre|&s;ent romantic love as the great important bu&s;ine&s;s of human life, and de&s;cribe all the other concerns of it as too low and paltry to merit the attention of &s;uch elevated beings, and fit only to employ the daughters of the plodding vulgar. In the&s;e letters, family affairs are mi&s;repre&s;ented, family &s;ecrets divulged, and fami|ly misfortunes aggravated. They are filled with vows of eternal amity, and prote&s;tations of never-ending love. But interjections and quotations are the principal em|belli&s;hments of the&s;e very &s;ublime epi&s;tles. Every pane|gyric contained in them is extravagant and hyperbolical, every cen&s;ure exaggerated and exce&s;&s;ive. In a favour|ite, every frailty is heightened into a perfection, and in a foe, degraded into a crime. The dramatic poets, e&s;pecially the mo&s;t tender and romantic, are quoted in almo&s;t every line, and every pompous or pathetic thought is forced to give up its natural and obvious meaning, and with all the violence of mi&s;application, is compelled to &s;uit &s;ome circum&s;tance of imaginary woe of the fair tran&s;criber.

<P>FATHERS <HI>have flinty hearts,</HI> is an expre&s;&s;ion worth an empire, and is always u&s;ed with peculiar empha&s;is and enthu&s;ia&s;m.

But as the&s;e young ladies
<PB N="39" REF="019810_0041_0FACB4319460EF28">
are fertile in expedients, and as their genius is never more agreeably exerci&s;ed than in finding re&s;ources, they are not without their &s;ecret exultation, in ca&s;e either of the above intere&s;ting events &s;hould happen, as they carry with them a certain air of tyranny and per&s;ecution which is very delightful. For a prohibit|ed corre&s;pondence is one of the great incidents of a &s;entimental life, and a letter clande&s;tinely received, the &s;upreme felicity of a &s;entimental lady.</P>
<P>NOTHING can equal the a&s;toni&s;hment of the&s;e &s;oar|ing &s;pirits, when their plain friends or prudent rela|tions pre&s;ume to remon&s;trate with them on any im|propriety in their conduct. But if the&s;e worthy peo|ple happen to be &s;omewhat advanced in life, their contempt is then a little &s;oftened by pity, at the re|flection that &s;uch very antiquated poor creatures &s;hould pretend to judge what is fit or unfit for ladies of their great refinement, &s;en&s;e, and reading. They con&s;ider them as wretches utterly ignorant of the &s;ub|lime plea&s;ures of a delicate and exalted pa&s;&s;ion; as tyrants who&s;e authority is to be contemned, and as &s;pies who&s;e vigilance is to be eluded. The prudence of the&s;e worthy friends they term &s;u&s;picion, and their experience dotage. For they are per&s;uaded, that the face of things has &s;o totally changed &s;ince their pa|rents were young, that though they might then judge tolerably for them&s;elves, yet they are now (with all their advantages of knowledge and ob&s;ervation) by no means qualified to direct their more enlightened daughters; who, if they have made a great progre&s;s in the &s;entimental walk, will be no more influenced by the advice of their mother, than they would go abroad in her laced pinner, or her brocade &s;uit.</P>
<P>BUT young people never &s;hew their folly and igno|rance more con&s;picuou&s;ly, than by this over confi|dence in their own judgment, and this haughty di&s;|dain of the opinion of tho&s;e who have known more

days. Youth has a quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, which it is very apt to mi&s;take for an acutene&s;s of penetra|tion. But youth, like cunning, though very conceit|ed, is very &s;hort-&s;ighted, and never more &s;o than when it di&s;regards the in&s;tructions of the wi&s;e, and the admonitions of the aged. The &s;ame vices and follies influenced the human heart in their day, which influence it now, and nearly in the &s;ame manner. One who well knew the world and its various vanities, has &s;aid, <Q>The thing which hath been, it is that which &s;hall be, and that which is done is that which &s;hall be done, and there is no new thing under the &s;un.</Q></P>
<P>IT is al&s;o a part of the &s;entimental character, to imagine that none but the young and the beautiful have any right to the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, or even to the common benefits and ble&s;&s;ings of life. Ladies of this turn al&s;o affect the mo&s;t lofty di&s;regard for u&s;eful qualities and dome&s;tic virtues; and this is a natural con&s;equence: for as this &s;ort of &s;entiment is only a word for idlene&s;s, &s;he who is con&s;tantly and u&s;efully employed, has neither lei&s;ure nor propen&s;ity to cultivate it.</P>
<P>A SENTIMENTAL lady principally values her&s;elf on the enlargement of her notions, and her liberal way of thinking. This &s;uperiority of &s;oul chiefly mani|fe&s;ts it&s;elf in the contempt of the&s;e minute delicacies and little decorums, which, trifling as they may be thought, tend at once to dignify the character, and to re&s;train the levity of the younger part of the &s;ex.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the error here complained of, originates in mi&s;taking <HI>&s;entiment</HI> and <HI>principle</HI> for each other. Now I conceive them to be extremely different. Sen|timent is the virtue of <HI>ideas,</HI> and principle the virtue of <HI>action.</HI> Sentiment has its &s;eat in the head, prin|ciple in the heart. Sentiment &s;ugge&s;ts fine harrangues and &s;ubtile di&s;tinctions; principle conceives ju&s;t no|tions, and performs good actions in con&s;equence of
<PB N="41" REF="019810_0043_0FACB43315A152B0">
them. Sentiment refines away the &s;implicity of truth and the plainne&s;s of piety; and, as a celebrated wit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Voltaire's Prophecy concerning Ro&s;&s;cau.</NOTE> has remarked of his no le&s;s celebrated cotemporary, gives us virtue in words and vice in deeds. Sentiment may be called the Athenian who <HI>knew</HI> what was right, and principle the Lacedemonian who <HI>practi&s;|ed</HI> it.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e qualities will be better exemplified by an attentive con&s;ideration of two admirably drawn charac|ters of Milton, which are beautifully, delicately, and di&s;tinctly marked.

<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding I have &s;poken with &s;ome a&s;perity again&s;t &s;entiment as oppo&s;ed to principle, yet I am convinced, that true genuine &s;entiment, (not the &s;ort I have been de&s;cribing) may be &s;o con|nected with principle, as to be&s;tow on it its brighte&s;t lu&s;tre, and its mo&s;t captivating graces. And enthu|&s;ia&s;m is &s;o far from being di&s;agreeable, that a portion of it is perhaps indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in an engag|ing woman. But it mu&s;t be the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the heart, not of the &s;en&s;es. It mu&s;t be the enthu&s;ia&s;m which grows up with a feeling mind, and is cheri&s;hed by a virtuous education; not that which is com|pounded of irregular pa&s;&s;ions, and artificially refined by books of unnatural fiction and improbable adven|ture. I will even go &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ert, that a young woman cannot have any real greatne&s;s of &s;oul, or true elevation of principle if &s;he has not a tincture of what the vulgar would call Romance, but which per|&s;ons of a certain way of thinking will di&s;cern to pro|ceed from tho&s;e fine feelings, and that charming &s;en|&s;ibility, without which, though a woman may be worthy, yet &s;he can never be amiable.</P>
<P>BUT this dangerous merit cannot be too rigidly watched, as it is very apt to lead tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it into inconveniences from which le&s;s intere&s;ting cha|racters are happily exempt. Young women of &s;trong

&s;en&s;ibility may be carried by the very amiablene&s;s of this temper, into the mo&s;t alarming extremes. Their ta&s;tes are pa&s;&s;ions. They love and hate with all their hearts, and &s;carcely &s;uffer them&s;elves to feel a rea&s;on|able preference before it &s;trengthens into a violent at|tachment.</P>
<P>WHEN an innocent girl of this open tru&s;ting, ten|der heart, happens to meet with one of her own &s;ex and age, who&s;e addre&s;s and manners are engaging, &s;he is in&s;tantly &s;eized with an ardent de&s;ire to com|mence a friend&s;hip with her. She feels the mo&s;t live|ly impatience at the re&s;traints of company, and the decorums of ceremony. She longs to be alone with her, longs to a&s;&s;ure her of the warmth of her tender|ne&s;s, and generou&s;ly a&s;cribes to the fair &s;tranger all the good qualities &s;he feels in her own heart, or rather all tho&s;e which &s;he has met with in her reading, di&s;|per&s;ed in a variety of heroines. She is per&s;uaded, that her new friend unites them all in her&s;elf, becau&s;e &s;he carries in her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing countenance the promi&s;e of them all. How cruel and how cen&s;orious would this inexperienced girl think her mother was, who &s;hould venture to hint, that the agreeable unknown had defects in her temper, or exceptions in her cha|racter. She would mi&s;take the&s;e hints of di&s;cretion for the in&s;inuations of an uncharitable di&s;po&s;ition. At fir&s;t &s;he would perhaps li&s;ten to them with a generous impatience, and afterwards with a cold and &s;ilent di&s;|dain. She would de&s;pi&s;e them as the effect of preju|dice, mi&s;repre&s;entation, or ignorance. The more ag|gravated the cen&s;ure, the more vehemently would &s;he prote&s;t in &s;ecret, that her friend&s;hip for this dear in|jured creature (who is rai&s;ed much higher in her e&s;teem by &s;uch injurious &s;u&s;picions) &s;hall know no bounds, as &s;he is a&s;&s;ured it can know no end.</P>
<P>YET this tru&s;ting confidence, this hone&s;t indi&s;cre|tion, is, at this early period of life, as amiable as it is
<PB N="45" REF="019810_0047_0FACB43627801B38">
natural; and will, if wi&s;ely cultivated, produce, at its proper &s;ea&s;on, fruits infinitely more valuable than all the guarded circum&s;pection of premature, and there|fore artificial prudence.

They are not &s;o un&s;u&s;pecting, nor &s;o ea|&s;ily led away by the predominance of fancy.

<P>BUT the above ob&s;ervations only extend to the young and the inexperienced; for I am very certain, that women are capable of as faithful and as durable friend&s;hip as any of the other &s;ex.

To regulate the features, while the &s;oul is in tumults, or to command the voice while the pa&s;&s;ions are without re&s;traint, is as idle as throwing odours in|to a &s;tream when the &s;ource is polluted.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;apient king,</HI> who knew better than any man the nature and the power of beauty, has a&s;&s;ured us, that the temper of the mind has a &s;trong influence up|on the features: "Wi&s;dom maketh the face to &s;hine," &s;ays that exqui&s;ite judge; and &s;urely no part of wi&s;dom is more likely to produce this amiable effect, than a placid &s;erenity of &s;oul.</P>
<P>IT will not be difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h the true from
<PB N="47" REF="019810_0048_0FACB436D39F2D98">
the artificial meekne&s;s. The former is univer&s;al and habitual; the latter, local and temporary. Every young female may keep this rule by her, to enable her to form a ju&s;t judgment of her own temper: if &s;he is not as gentle to her chambermaid as &s;he is to her vi|&s;itor, &s;he may re&s;t &s;atisfied that the &s;pirit of gentlene&s;s is not in her.</P>
<P>WHO would not be &s;hocked and di&s;appointed to behold a well-bred young lady, &s;oft and engaging as the doves of Venus, di&s;playing a thou&s;and graces and attractions to win the hearts of a large company, and the in&s;tant they are gone, to &s;ee her look mad as the Pythian maid, and all the frightened graces driven from her furious countenance, only becau&s;e her gown was brought home a quarter of an hour later than &s;he ex|pected, or her ribbon &s;ent half a &s;hade lighter or dark-than &s;he orderd?</P>
<P>ALL men's characters are &s;aid to proceed from their &s;ervants; and this is more particularly true of ladies: for as their &s;ituations are more dome&s;tic, they lie more open to the in&s;pection of their families, to whom their real characters are ea&s;ily and perfectly known; for they &s;eldom think it worth while to practi&s;e any di&s;gui&s;e before tho&s;e, who&s;e good opinion they do not value, and who are obliged to &s;ubmit to their mo&s;t in&s;upportable humours, becau&s;e they are paid for it.</P>
<P>AMONGST women of breeding, the exterior of gentlene&s;s is &s;o uniformly a&s;&s;umed, and the whole manner is &s;o perfectly level and <HI>uni,</HI> that it is next to impo&s;&s;ible for a &s;tranger to know any thing of their true di&s;po&s;itions by conver&s;ing with them, and even the very features are &s;o exactly regulated, that phy&s;iognomy, which may &s;ometimes be tru&s;ted among the vulgar, is, with the polite, a mo&s;t lying &s;cience.</P>
<P>A VERY termagant woman, if &s;he happens al&s;o to be a very artful one, will be con&s;cious &s;he has &s;o much to conceal, that the dread of betraying her real temper
<PB N="48" REF="019810_0050_0FACB43871F14F10">
will make her put on an over-acted &s;oftne&s;s, which, from its very exce&s;s, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the natural by a penetrating eye. That gentlene&s;s is ever liable to be &s;u&s;pected for the counterfeited, which is &s;o ex|ce&s;&s;ive as to deprive people of the proper u&s;e of &s;peech and motion, or which, as Hamlet &s;ays, makes them li&s;p and amble, and nick-name God's creatures.</P>
<P>THE countenance and manners of &s;ome very fa&s;hion|able per&s;ons may be compared to the in&s;criptions on their monuments, which &s;peak nothing but good of what is within; but he who knows any thing of the world, or of the human heart, will no more tru&s;t to the courte&s;y, than he will depend on the epitaph.</P>
<P>AMONG the various artifices of factitious meekne&s;s, one of the mo&s;t frequent and mo&s;t plau&s;ible, is that of affecting to be always equally delighted with all per|&s;ons and all characters. The &s;ociety of the&s;e languid beings is without confidence, their friend&s;hip without attachment, and their love without affection, or even preference. This in&s;ipid mode of conduct may be &s;afe, but I cannot think it has either ta&s;te, &s;en&s;e, or principle in it.</P>
<P>THESE uniformly &s;miling and approving ladies, who have neither the noble courage to reprehend vice, nor the generous warmth to bear their hone&s;t te&s;timony in the cau&s;e of virtue, conclude every one to be ill-natur|ed who has any penetration, and look upon a di&s;tin|gui&s;hing judgment as want of tenderne&s;s. But they &s;hould learn, that this di&s;cernment does not always proceed from an uncharitable temper, but from that long experience and thorough knowledge of the world, which lead the&s;e who have it to &s;crutinize into the conduct and di&s;po&s;ition of men, before they tru&s;t en|tirely to tho&s;e fair appearances, which &s;ometimes veil the mo&s;t in&s;idious purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>WE are perpetually mi&s;taking the qualities and di&s;|po&s;itions of our own hearts. We elevate our failings
<PB N="49" REF="019810_0051_0FACB439213DCFB8">
into virtues, and qualify our vices into weakne&s;&s;es and hence ari&s;e &s;o many fal&s;e judgments re&s;pecting meekne&s;s. Self-ignorance is at the root of all this mi&s;chief. Many ladies complain that, for their part, their &s;pirit is &s;o meek they can bear nothing; where|as, if they &s;poke truth, they would &s;ay, their &s;pirit is &s;o high and unbroken that they can bear nothing. Strange! to plead their meekne&s;s as a rea&s;on why they cannot endure to be cro&s;&s;ed, and to produce their impatience of contradiction as a proof of their gentlene&s;s!</P>
<P>MEEKNESS, like mo&s;t other virtues, has certain limits, which it no &s;ooner exceeds than it becomes criminal. Servility of &s;pirit is not gentlene&s;s but weakne&s;s, and if allowed, under the &s;pecious appear|ances it &s;ometimes puts on, will lead to the mo&s;t dan|gerous compliances. She who hears innocence malig|ned without vindicating it, fal&s;ehood a&s;&s;erted without contradicting it, or religion prophaned without re&s;ent|ing it, is not gentle but wicked.</P>
<P>TO give up the cau&s;e of an innocent, injured friend, if the popular cry happens to be again&s;t him, is the mo&s;t di&s;graceful weakne&s;s. This was the ca&s;e of Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> de Maintenon.

fortunate. Compare her conduct with that of her undaunted and pious countryman and cotemporary, Bougi, who, when Louis would have prevailed on him to renounce his religion for a commi&s;&s;ion or a go|vernment, nobly replied, "If I could be per&s;uaded to "betray my God for a mar&s;hal's &s;taff, I might betray my king for a bribe of much le&s;s con&s;equence."</P>
<P>MEEKNESS is imperfect, if it be not both active and pa&s;&s;ive; if it will not enable us to &s;ubdue our own pa&s;&s;ions and re&s;entments, as well as qualify us to bear patiently the pa&s;&s;ions and re&s;entments of others.</P>
<P>BEFORE we give way to any violent emotion of anger, it would perhaps be worth while to con&s;ider the value of the object which excites, it, and to reflect for a moment, whither the thing we &s;o ardently de|&s;ire, or &s;o vehemently re&s;ent, be really of as much importance to us, as that delightful tranquillity of &s;oul, which we renounce in pur&s;uit of it. If, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a fair calculation, we find we are not likely to get as much as we are &s;ure to lo&s;e, then, putting all religious con|&s;iderations out of the que&s;tion, common &s;en&s;e and hu|man policy will tell us, we have made a fooli&s;h and unprofitable exchange. Inward quiet is a part of one's &s;elf; the object of our re&s;entment may be only a matter of opinion; and certainly, what makes a portion of our actual happine&s;s ought to be too dear to us, to be &s;acrified for a trifling, foreign, perhaps imaginary good.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t pointed &s;atire I remember to have read, on a mind en&s;laved by anger, is an ob&s;ervation of Se|neca's. "Alexander (&s;aid he) had two friends, Clitus and Ly&s;imachus; the one he expo&s;ed to a lion, the other to him&s;elf: he who was turned loo&s;e to the bea&s;t e&s;caped, but Clitus was murdered, for he was turned loo&s;e to an angry man."</P>
<P>A PASSIONATE woman's happine&s;s is never in her own keeping: it is the &s;port of accident, and the
<PB N="51" REF="019810_0053_0FACB43B46616858">
&s;lave of events. It is in the power of her acquaintance, her &s;ervants, but chiefly of her enemies; and all her comforts lie at the mercy of others. So far from being willing to learn of him who was meek and lowly, &s;he con&s;iders meekne&s;s as the want of a becoming &s;pirit, and lowline&s;s as a de&s;picable and vulgar mean|ne&s;s. And an imperious woman will &s;o little covet the ornament of a meek and quiet &s;pirit, that it is almo&s;t the only ornament &s;he will not be &s;olicitous to wear. But re&s;entment is a very expen&s;ive vice. How dearly has it co&s;t its vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aries, even from the &s;in of Cain, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">nder in this Kind! "It is cheaper (&s;ays a pious writer) to forgive, and &s;ave the charges."</P>
<P>IF it were only for more human rea&s;ons, it would turn to a better account to be patient; nothing de|feats the malice of an enemy like a &s;pirit of forbear|ance; the return of rage for rage cannot be &s;o effec|tually provoking. True gentlene&s;s, like an impene|trable armour repels the mo&s;t pointed &s;hafts of malice: they cannot pierce through this invulnerable &s;hield, but either fall hurtle&s;s to the ground, or return to wound the hand that &s;hot them.</P>
<P>A MEEK &s;pirit will not look out of it&s;elf for hap|pine&s;s, becau&s;e it finds a con&s;tant banquet at home; yet, by a &s;ort of divine alchymy, it will convert all external events to its own profit, and be able to deduce &s;ome good, even from the mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing; it will extract comfort and &s;atisfaction from the mo&s;t barren circum&s;tances: <Q>It will &s;uck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the &s;upreme excellence of this complacent quality is, that it naturally di&s;po&s;es the mind where it re&s;ides to the practice of every other that is amiable. Meekne&s;s may be called the pioneer of all the other virtues, which levels every ob&s;truction, and &s;mooths every difficulty that might impede their entrance, or retard their progre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="019810_0054_0FACB43B68F87AC8">
THE peculiar importance and value of this amiable virtue may be farther &s;een in its permanency. Ho|nours and dignities are tran&s;ient, beauty and riches frail and fugacious, to a proverb. Would not the truly wi&s;e, therefore, wi&s;h to have &s;ome one po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, which they might call their own in the &s;evere&s;t exigencies?

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON THE CULTIVATION OF THE HEART AND TEMPER IN THE Education of Daughters.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE not the fooli&s;h pre&s;umption to imagine, that I can offer any thing new on a &s;ubject, which has been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully treated by many learned and able writers, I would only, with all po&s;&s;ible deference, beg leave to hazard a few &s;hort remarks on that part of the &s;ubject of education, which I would call the <HI>education of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eart.</HI> I am well aware, that this part al&s;o has not been le&s;s &s;kilf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lly and forcibly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed than the re&s;t, though I cannot, at the &s;ame time, help remarking, that it does not appear to have been &s;o much adopted into common practice.</P>

IT appears then, that notwith&s;tanding the great and real improvements, which have been made in the af|fair of female education, and notwith&s;tanding the more enlarged and generous views of it, which prevail in the pre&s;ent day, that there is &s;till a very material defect, which it is not, in general, enough the object of attention to remove. This defect &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in this, that too little regard is paid to the di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>mind,</HI> that the indications of the <HI>temper</HI> are not properly cheri&s;hed, nor the affections of the <HI>heart</HI> &s;uf|ficiently regulated.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t education of girls, as far as the cu&s;toms which fa&s;hion e&s;tabli&s;hes are right, they &s;hould un|doubtedly be followed. Let the exterior be made a con&s;iderable object of attention, but let it not be the principal, let it not be the only one.&mdash;Let the gra|ces be indu&s;triou&s;ly cultivated, but let them not be cultivated at the expence of the virtues.&mdash;Let the arms, the head, the whole per&s;on be carefully poli&s;h|ed, but let not the heart be the only portion of the human anatomy, which &s;hall be totally overlooked.</P>
<P>THE neglect of this cultivation &s;eems to proceed as much from a bad ta&s;te, as from a fal&s;e principle. The generality of people form their judgment of educa|tion by &s;light and &s;udden appearances, which is cer|tainly a wrong way of determining. Mu&s;ic, dancing, and languages, gratify tho&s;e who teach them, by per|ceptible and almo&s;t immedate effects; and when there happens to be no imbecillity in the pupil, nor defici|ency in the ma&s;ter, every &s;uperficial ob&s;erver can, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, judge of the progre&s;s.&mdash;The effects of mo&s;t of the&s;e accompli&s;hments addre&s;s them&s;elves to the &s;en&s;es; and there are more who can &s;ee and hear, than there are who can judge and reflect.</P>
<P>PERSONAL perfection is not only more obvious, it is al&s;o more rapid; and even in very accompli&s;hed cha|racters, elegance u&s;ually precedes principle.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="019810_0057_0FACB43DC8D57598">
BUT the heart, that natural &s;eat of evil propen&s;i|ties, that little trouble&s;ome empire of the pa&s;&s;ions, is led to what is right by &s;low motions and imperceptible degrees. It mu&s;t be admoni&s;hed by reproof, and allur|ed by kindne&s;s. Its livelie&s;t advances are frequently impeded by the ob&s;tinacy of prejudice, and its bright|e&s;t promi&s;es often ob&s;cured by the tempe&s;ts of pa&s;|&s;ion. It is &s;low in its acqui&s;ition of virtue, and reluc|tant in its approaches to piety.</P>
<P>THERE is another rea&s;on, which proves this mental cultivation to be more important, as well as more dif|ficult, than any other part of education. In the u&s;ual fa&s;hionable accompli&s;hments, the bu&s;ine&s;s of acquiring them is almo&s;t always getting forwards, and one diffi|culty is conquered before another is &s;uffered to &s;hew it&s;elf; for a prudent teacher will level the road his pu|pil is to pa&s;s, and &s;mooth the inequalities which might retard her progre&s;s</P>
<P>BUT in morals, (which &s;hould be the great object con&s;tantly kept in view) the ta&s;k is far more difficult. The unruly and turbulent de&s;ires of the heart are not &s;o obedient; one pa&s;&s;ion will &s;tart up before another is &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. The &s;ubduing Hercules cannot cut off the heads &s;o often as the prolific Hydra can produce them, nor fell the &s;tubborn Antaeus &s;o fa&s;t as he can recruit his &s;trength, and ri&s;e in vigorous and repeated oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>IF all the accompli&s;hments could be bought at the price of a &s;ingle virtue, the purcha&s;e would be infinite|ly dear! And, however &s;tartling it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound, I think it is, notwith&s;tanding, true, that the labours of a good and wi&s;e mother, who is anxious for her daughter's mo&s;t important intere&s;ts, will &s;eem to be at variance with tho&s;e of her in&s;tructors. She will doubtle&s;s re|joice at her progre&s;s in any polite art, but &s;he will re|joice with trembling:&mdash;humility and piety form the &s;olid and durable ba&s;is, on which &s;he wi&s;hes to rai&s;e

the &s;uper&s;tructure of the accompli&s;hments, while the accompli&s;hments them&s;elves are frequently of that un|&s;teady nature, that if the foundation is not &s;ecur|ed, in proportion as the building is enlarged, it will be overloaded and de&s;troyed by tho&s;e very ornaments, which were intended to embelli&s;h, what they have con|tributed to ruin.</P>
<P>THE more o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ten&s;ible qualifications &s;hould be care|fully regulated, or they will be in danger of putting to &s;light the mode&s;t train of retreating virtues, which cannot &s;afely &s;ub&s;i&s;t before the bold eye of public ob|&s;ervation, or bear the bolder tongue of impudent and audacious flattery. A tender mother cannot but feel an hone&s;t triumph, in contemplating tho&s;e excellencies in her daughter which de&s;erve applau&s;e, but &s;he will al&s;o &s;hudder at the vanity which that applau&s;e may excite, and at tho&s;e hitherto unknown ideas which it may awaken.</P>

But as the world &s;eems to be very well appri&s;ed of their importance, there is the le&s;s occa&s;ion to in&s;i&s;t on their utility. Yet, though well-bred young women &s;hould learn to dance, &s;ing, recite, and draw, the end of a good education is not that they may become dancers, &s;ingers, players or painters: its real object is to make them good daugh|ters, good wives, good mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, good members of &s;o|ciety, and good chri&s;tians.

<P>ONE great art of education con&s;i&s;ts in not &s;uffering the feelings to become too accute by unnece&s;&s;ary a|wakening, nor too obtu&s;e by the want of exertion.

The preci&s;e and premature wi&s;dom, which &s;ome girls have cunning enough to a&s;&s;ume, is of a more dangerous tendency than any of their natural failings can be, as it effectually covers tho&s;e &s;ecret bad di&s;po&s;itions, which, if they di&s;played them&s;elves, might be rectified. The hypocri&s;y of a&s;|&s;uming virtues which are not inherent in the heart, prevents the growth and di&s;clo&s;ure of tho&s;e real ones, which it is the great end of education to cultivate.</P>
<P>BUT if the natural indications of the temper are to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and &s;tifled, where are the diagno&s;tics, by which the &s;tate of the mind is to be known? The wi&s;e author of all things, who did nothing in vain, doubtle&s;s intended them as &s;ymptoms, by which to judge of the di&s;ea&s;es of the heart; and it is impo&s;&s;ible di&s;ea&s;es &s;hould be cured before they are known. If the &s;tream be &s;o cut off as to prevent communication, or &s;o choked up as to defeat di&s;covery, how &s;hall we ever reach the &s;ource, out of which are the i&s;&s;ues of life?</P>
<P>THIS cunning, which, of all the different di&s;po&s;i|tions girls di&s;cover, is mo&s;t to be dreaded, is increa&s;ed by nothing &s;o much as by fear. If tho&s;e about them expre&s;s violent and unrea&s;onable anger at every trivial offence, it will always promote this temper, and will very frequently create it, where there was a natural tendency to frankne&s;s. The indi&s;creet tran&s;ports of rage, which many betray on every &s;light occa&s;ion, and the little di&s;tinction they make between venial errors and premeditated crimes, naturally di&s;po&s;e a child to conceal, what &s;he does not however care to &s;uppre&s;s. Anger in one will not remedy the faults of another; for how can an in&s;trument of &s;in cure &s;in? If a girl is kept in a &s;tate of perpetual and &s;lavi&s;h terror, &s;he will perhaps have artifice enough to conceal tho&s;e propen|&s;ities which &s;he knows are wrong, or tho&s;e actions which &s;he thinks are mo&s;t obnoxious to puni&s;hment.

The natural ca&s;t of character, and the moral di&s;tinctions between the &s;exes, &s;hould not be di&s;regarded even in childhood.

Girls &s;hould be taught to give up their opinions betimes, and not pertinaciou&s;ly to carry on a di&s;pute, even if they &s;hould know them&s;elves to be in the right. I do not mean, that they &s;hould be rob|bed of the liberty of private judgment, but that they &s;hould by no means be encouraged to contract a con|tentious or contradictory turn. It is of the greate&s;t importance to their future happine&s;s, that they &s;hould acquire a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive temper, and a forbearing &s;pirit; for it is a le&s;&s;on which the world will not fail to make them frequently practi&s;e, when they come abroad into it, and they will not practi&s;e it the wor&s;e for having learnt it the &s;ooner. The&s;e early re&s;traints, in the limitation here meant, are &s;o far from being an effect of cruelty, that they are the mo&s;t undubitable marks of affection, and are the more meritorious, as they are &s;evere trials of tenderne&s;s.

<P>THOSE who have children to educate ought to be extremely patient: it is indeed a labour of love. They &s;hould reflect, that extraordinary talents are neither e&s;&s;ential to the well-being of &s;ociety, nor to the hap|pine&s;s of individuals. If that had been the ca&s;e, the beneficent Father of the univer&s;e would not have made them &s;o rare. For it is as ea&s;y for an Almighty Cre|ator to produce a Newton, as an ordinary man; and he could have made tho&s;e powers common which we now con&s;ider as wonderful, without any miraculous exertion of his omnipotence, if the exi&s;tence of many Newtons had been nece&s;&s;ary to the perfection of his wi&s;e and gracious plan.</P>
<P>SURELY, therefore, there is more piety, as well as more &s;en&s;e, in labouring to improve the talents which children actually have, than in lamenting that they do not po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;upernatural endowments or angelic perfections. A pa&s;&s;age of Lord Bacon's furni&s;hes an admirable incitement for endeavouring to carry the amiable and chri&s;tian grace of charity to its farthe&s;t extent, in&s;tead of indulging an over-anxious care for more brilliant but le&s;s important acqui&s;itions. <Q>The de&s;ire of power in exce&s;s (&s;ays he) cau&s;ed the angels to fall; the de&s;ire of knowledge in exce&s;s cau&s;ed man to fall; but in charity is no exce&s;s, neither can men nor angels come into danger by it.</Q></P>

IT is as injudicious for parents to &s;et out with too &s;anguine a dependence on the merit of their children, as it for them to be di&s;couraged at every repul&s;e.

Tho&s;e who hope to do a great deal, mu&s;t not expect to do every thing. If they know any thing of the malignity of &s;in, the blindne&s;s of prejudice, or the corruption of the human heart, they will al&s;o know, that that heart will always remain, after the very be&s;t po&s;&s;ible education, full of infirmity and imperfection. Extraordinary allowan|ces, therefore, mu&s;t be made for the weakne&s;s of nature in this its weake&s;t &s;tate. After much is done, much will remain to do, and much, very much, will &s;till be left undone. For this regulation of the pa&s;&s;ions and affections cannot be the work of education alone, without the concurrence of divine grace operating on the heart. Why then &s;hould parents repine, if their efforts are not always crowned with immediate &s;ucce&s;s? They &s;hould con&s;ider, that they are not educating cherubims and &s;eraphims, but men and women; crea|tures, who at their be&s;t e&s;tate are altogether vanity: how little th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n can be expected from them in the weakne&s;s and imbecillity of infancy!

<P>GREAT allowances mu&s;t be made for a profu&s;ion of gaiety, loquacity, and even indi&s;cretion in children, that there may be animation enough left to &s;upply an active and u&s;eful character, when the fir&s;t fermentation of the youthful pa&s;&s;ions is over, and the redundant &s;pirits &s;hall come to &s;ub&s;ide.</P>

It cannot be violently bent, or unnaturally forced towards an object of a to|tally oppo&s;ite nature, but may be gradually inclined towards a corre&s;pondent but &s;uperior affection.

They are not &s;o &s;oon &s;ent from under the paternal eye into the bu&s;tle of the world, and &s;o early expo&s;ed to the contagion of bad example: their heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> are naturally more flexible, &s;oft and liable to any kind of impre&s;&s;ion the forming hand may &s;tamp on them; and, la&s;tly, as they do not receive the &s;ame cla&s;&s;ical education with boys, their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ble mind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> are not obliged at once to receive and &s;eparate the precepts of chri&s;tianity, and the documents of pagan philo&s;ophy. The nece&s;&s;ity of doing this perhaps &s;omewhat weakens the &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions of young men, at lea&s;t till the under&s;tanding is formed, and confu&s;es their ideas of piety, by mixing them with &s;o much heterogeneous matter.

which we contract, in our earlie&s;t education, for the manners of pagan antiquity.</Q></P>
<P>GIRLS, therefore, who do <HI>not</HI> contract this early partiality, ought to have a clearer notion of their religious duties: they are not obliged, at an age when the judgment is &s;o weak, to di&s;tingui&s;h between the doctrines of Zeno, of Epicurus, and of Chri&s;t; and to embarra&s;s their minds with the various morals which were taught in the <HI>Porch,</HI> in the <HI>Academy,</HI> and on the <HI>Mount.</HI></P>

<P>BUT the mere exemption from infidelity is &s;o &s;mall a part of the religious character, that I hope no one will attempt to claim any merit from this negative &s;ort of goodne&s;s, or value her&s;elf merely for not being the very wor&s;t thing &s;he po&s;&s;ibly can be. Let no mi&s;taken girl fancy &s;he gives a proof of her wit by her want of piety, or that a contempt of things &s;erious and &s;acred will exalt her under&s;tanding, or rai&s;e her character even in the opinion of the mo&s;t avowed male in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">idels.

<P>CICERO &s;poke it as the highe&s;t commendation of Cato's character that he embraced philo&s;ophy, not for the &s;ake of <HI>di&s;puting</HI> like a philo&s;opher, but of <HI>living</HI> like one. The chief purpo&s;e of chri&s;tian know|ledge is to promote the great end of a chri&s;tian life. Every rational woman &s;hould, no doubt, be able to give a rea&s;on of the hope that is in her; but this knowledge is be&s;t acquired, and the duties con&s;equent on it be&s;t performed, by reading books of plain piety and practical devotion, and not by entering into the endle&s;s feuds, and engaging in the unprofitable con|tentions of partial controver&s;iali&s;ts. Nothing is more unamiable than the narrow &s;pirit of party-zeal, nor more di&s;gu&s;ting than to hear a woman deal out judg|ments, and denounce vengeance again&s;t any one, who happens to differ from her in &s;ome opinion, perhaps of no real importance, and which, it is probable, &s;he

A furious and unmerci|ful female bigot wanders as far beyond the limits pre&s;cribed to her &s;ex, as a Thale&s;tris or a Joan d'Arc.

<P>But though no one will be frightened out of their opinions, yet they may be per&s;uaded out of them: they may be touched by the affecting earne&s;tne&s;s of &s;erious conver&s;ation, and allured by the attractive beauty of a con&s;i&s;tently &s;erious life. And while a young woman ought to dread the name of a wrangling polemic, it is her duty to a&s;pire after the honourable character of a &s;incere Chri&s;tian. But this dignified character &s;he can by no means de&s;erve, if &s;he is ever afraid to avow her principles, or a&s;hamed to defend them. A profli|gate, who makes it a point to ridicule every thing which comes under the appearance of formal in&s;truc|tion, will be di&s;concerted at the &s;pirited yet mode&s;t re|buke of a pious young woman. But there is as much efficacy in the manner of reproving prophanene&s;s, as in the words. If &s;he corrects it with moro&s;ene&s;s, &s;he defeats the effect of her remedy, by her un&s;kilful manner of admini&s;tring it. If, on the other hand, &s;he affects to defend the in&s;ulted cau&s;e of God, in a faint tone of voice, and &s;tudied ambiguity of phra&s;e, or with an air of levity, and a certain expre&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ure in her eyes, which proves &s;he is &s;ecretly de|lighted with what &s;he pretends to cen&s;ure, &s;he injures religion much more than he did who publicly pro|phaned it; for &s;he plainly indicates, either that &s;he does not believe, or re&s;pect what &s;he profe&s;&s;es. The other attacked it as an open foe; &s;he betrays it as a fal&s;e friend.

IT is a &s;trange notion which prevails in the world, that religion only belongs to the old and the melancho|ly, and that it is not worth while to pay the lea&s;t atten|tion to it, while we are capable of attending to any thing el&s;e.

<P>GREAT injury is done to the intere&s;ts of religion, by placing it in a gloomy and unamiable light.

GOOD &s;en&s;e is &s;o far from de&s;erving the appellation of <HI>common &s;en&s;e,</HI> by which it is frequently called, that it is perhaps one of the rare&s;t qualities of the human mind. If, indeed, this name is given it in re&s;pect to its peculiar &s;uitablene&s;s to the purpo&s;es of common life, there is great propriety in it. Good &s;en&s;e ap|pears to differ from ta&s;te in this, that ta&s;te is an in|&s;tantaneous deci&s;ion of the mind, a &s;udden reli&s;h of what is beautiful, or di&s;gu&s;t at what is defective, in an object, without waiting for the &s;lower confirma|tion of the judgment. Good &s;en&s;e is perhaps that confirmation, which e&s;tabli&s;hes a &s;uddenly conceived idea, or feeling, by the powers of comparing and reflecting. They differ al&s;o in this, that ta&s;te &s;eems to have a more immediate reference to arts, to litera|ture, and to almo&s;t every object of the &s;en&s;es; while good &s;en&s;e ri&s;es to moral excellence, and exerts its influence on life and manners. Ta&s;te is fitted to the perception and enjoyment of whatever is beautiful in art or nature: Good &s;en&s;e, to the improvement of the conduct, and the regulation of the heart.</P>
<P>YET the term good &s;en&s;e, is u&s;ed indi&s;criminately to expre&s;s either a fini&s;hed ta&s;te for letters, or an in|variable prudence in the affairs of life. It is &s;ometimes applied to the mo&s;t moderate abilities, in which ca&s;e, the expre&s;&s;ion i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> certainly too &s;trong; and at others to the mo&s;t &s;hining, when it is as much too weak and inadequate.

perfection, where the &s;eeds of it are wanting in the mind, yet it is capable of infinite improvement where it actually exi&s;ts, and is attended with the highe&s;t ca|pacity of communicating in&s;truction, as well as delight to others.</P>
<P>IT is the peculiar property of genius to &s;trike out great or beautiful things: it is the felicity of good &s;en&s;e not to do ab&s;urd ones.

<P>THIS is perhaps the fine&s;t picture of human genius that ever was drawn by a human pencil. It pre&s;ents a living image of a creative imagination, or a power of inventing things which have no actual exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>WITH &s;uperficial judges, who, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, make up the greater part of the ma&s;s of mankind, ta|lents are only liked or under&s;tood to a certain degree. Lofty ideas are above the reach of ordinary appre|hen&s;ions: the vulgar allow tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them to be in a &s;omewhat higher &s;tate of mind than them&s;elves; but of the va&s;t gulf which &s;eparates them, they have not the lea&s;t conception. They acknowledge a &s;upe|riority, but of its extent they neither know the value, nor can conceive the reality. It is true, the mind, as well as the eye, can take in objects larger than it|&s;elf; but this is only true of great minds: for a man of low capacity, who con&s;iders a con&s;ummate genius, re&s;embles one, who &s;eeing a column for the fir&s;t time, and &s;tanding at too great a di&s;tance to take in the

<P>WHAT the greater part of the world mean by com|mon &s;en&s;e, will be generally found, on a clo&s;er enqui|ry, to be art, fraud, or &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s!

ADD to this, when it is con&s;idered with what im|perfection the Divine Wi&s;dom has thought fit to &s;tamp every thing human, it will be found, that excellence and infirmity are &s;o in&s;eparably wound up in each other, that a man derives the &s;orene&s;s of temper, and irritability of nerve, which make him unea&s;y to others, and unhappy in him&s;elf, from tho&s;e exqui&s;ite feelings, and that elevated pitch of thought, by which, as the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it on a more &s;erious occa&s;ion, he is, as it were, out of the body.</P>

<P>YET it has been objected that &s;tudy is a great ene|my to originality; but even if this were true, it would perhaps be as well that an author &s;hould give us the ideas of &s;till better writers, mixed and a&s;&s;imilated with the matter in his own mind, as tho&s;e crude and undi|ge&s;ted thoughts which he values under the notion that they are original. The &s;weete&s;t honey neither ta&s;tes of the ro&s;e, the honey-&s;uckle, nor the carna|tion, yet it is compounded of the very e&s;&s;ence of them all.</P>
<P>IF in the other fine arts this accumulation of know|ledge is nece&s;&s;ary, it is indi&s;pen&s;ably &s;o in poetry. It is a fatal ra&s;hne&s;s for any one to tru&s;t too much to their own &s;tock of ideas. He mu&s;t invigorate them by exerci&s;e, poli&s;h them by conver&s;ation, and increa&s;e them by every &s;pecies of elegant and virtuous know|ledge, and the mind will not fail to reproduce with intere&s;t tho&s;e &s;eeds, which are &s;own in it by &s;tudy and ob&s;ervation. Above all, let every one guard again&s;t the dangerous opinion that he knows enough: an opi|nion that will weaken the energy and reduce the powers of the mind, which, though once perhaps vigorous and effectual, will be &s;unk to a &s;tate of literary imbe|cility, by cheri&s;hing vain and pre&s;umptuous ideas of its own independence.</P>
<P>FOR in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ance, it may not be nece&s;&s;ary that a poet &s;hould be deeply &s;killed in the Linnaean &s;y&s;tem; but it mu&s;t be allowed that a general acquaintance with plants and flowers will furni&s;h him with a delightful and profitable &s;pecies of in&s;truction. He is not o|bliged to trace Nature in all her nice and varied ope|rations, with the minute accuracy of a Boyle, or the laborious inve&s;tigation of a Newton; but his <HI>good &s;en&s;e</HI> will point out to him that no incon&s;iderable portion

of philo&s;ophical knowledge is requi&s;ite to the com|pletion of his literary character. The &s;ciences are more independent, and require little or no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the graces of poetry; but poetry, if &s;he would charm and in&s;truct, mu&s;t not be &s;o haughty; &s;he mu&s;t be contented to borrow of the &s;ciences, many of her choice&s;t allu&s;ions, and many of her mo&s;t graceful em|belli&s;hments; and does it not magnify the character of true poe&s;y, that &s;he includes within her&s;elf all the &s;cattered graces of every &s;eparate art?</P>
<P>THE rules of the great ma&s;ters in critici&s;m may not be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the forming a good ta&s;te, as the examination of tho&s;e original mines from whence they drew their trea&s;ures of knowledge.</P>
<P>THE three celebrated E&s;&s;ays on the Art of Poetry do not teach &s;o much by their laws as by their exam|ples; the dead letter of their rules is le&s;s in&s;tructive than the living &s;pirit of their ver&s;e. Yet the&s;e rules are to a young poet, what the &s;tudy of logarithms is to a young mathematician; they do not &s;o much con|tribute to form his judgment, as afford him the &s;ati&s;|faction of convincing him that he is right. They do not preclude the difficulty of the operation; but at the conclu&s;ion of it, furni&s;h him with a fuller demon|&s;tration that he has proceeded on proper principles. When he has well &s;tudied the ma&s;ters in who&s;e &s;chools the fir&s;t critics formed them&s;elves, and fancies he has caught a &s;park of their divine flame, it may be a good method to try his own compo&s;itions by the te&s;t of the critic rules, &s;o far indeed as the mechani&s;m of poetry goes. If the examination be fair and candid, this trial, like the touch of It<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">riel's &s;pear, will de|tect every latent error, and bring to light every fa|vourite failing.</P>
<P>GOOD ta&s;te always &s;uits the mea&s;ure of its admira|tion to the merit of the compo&s;ition it examines. It accommodates its prai&s;es, or its cen&s;ure, to the excel|lence
<PB N="86" REF="019810_0088_0FACB457DC901E58">
of a work, and appropriates it to the nature of it. General applau&s;e, or indi&s;criminate abu&s;e, is the &s;ign of a vulgar under&s;tanding. There are certain blemi&s;hes which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he judicious and good-natured reader will candidly overlook. But the fal&s;e &s;ublime, the tumour which is intended for greatne&s;s, the di&s;torted figure, the puerile conceit, and the incongruous me|taphor, the&s;e are defects for which &s;carcely any other kind of merit can atone. And yet there may be more hope of a writer (e&s;pecially if he be a young one), who is now and then guilty of &s;ome of the&s;e faults, than of one who avoids them all, not through judg|ment, but feeblene&s;s, and who, in&s;tead of deviating into error is continually falling &s;hort of excellence. The mere ab&s;ence of error implies that moderate and inferior degree of merit with which a cold heart and a phlegmatic ta&s;te will be better &s;atisfied than with the magnificent irregularities of exalted &s;pirits. It &s;tretches &s;ome minds to an unea&s;y exten&s;ion to be o|bliged to attend to compo&s;itions &s;uperlatively excel|lent; and it contracts liberal &s;ouls to a painful nar|rowne&s;s to de&s;cend to books of inferior merit.

THERE is another feeling which is called Enthu&s;i|a&s;m. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;en&s;ible hearts is &s;o &s;trong, that it only yields to the impul&s;e with which &s;triking objects act on it, but &s;uch hearts help on the effect by their own &s;en&s;ibility. In a &s;cene where Shake&s;peare and Garrick give perfection to each other, the feeling heart does not merely accede to the delirium they oc|ca&s;ion: it does more, it is enamoured of it, it &s;olicits the delu&s;ion, it &s;ues to be deceived, and grudgingly cheri&s;hes the &s;acred trea&s;ure of its feelings. The poet and performer concur in carrying us
<Q>Beyond this vi&s;ible diurnal &s;phere.</Q>
they bear us aloft in their airy cour&s;e with unre&s;i&s;ted rapidity, if they meet not with any ob&s;truction from the coldne&s;s of our own feelings. Perhaps only a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine &s;pirits can enter into the detail of their writing and acting; but the multitude do not enjoy le&s;s acute|ly, becau&s;e they are not able philo&s;ophically to analy&s;e the &s;ources of their joy or &s;orrow. If the others have the advantage of judging, the&s;e have at lea&s;t the pri|vilege of feeling: and it is not from complai&s;ance to a few leading judges, that they bur&s;t into peals of laughter, or melt into delightful agony; their hearts decide, and that is a deci&s;ion from which there lies no appeal. It mu&s;t however be confe&s;&s;ed, that the nicer &s;eparations of character, and the lighter and almo&s;t imperceptible &s;hades which &s;ometimes di&s;tingui&s;h them, will not be intimately reli&s;hed, unle&s;s there be a con&s;onancy of ta&s;te as well as feeling in the &s;pecta|tors; though where the pa&s;&s;ions are principally con|cerned, the prophane vulgar come in for a larger por|tion of the univer&s;al delight, than critics and con|noi&s;&s;eurs are willing to allow them.</P>
<P>YET enthu&s;ia&s;m, though the natural concomitant of genius, is no more genius it&s;elf, than drunkenne&s;s is
<PB N="88" REF="019810_0090_0FACB459AC1C1188">
cheeerfulne&s;s; and that enthu&s;ia&s;m which di&s;covers it&s;elf on occa&s;ions not worthy to excite it, is the mark of a wretched judgment and a fal&s;e ta&s;te.</P>
<P>NATURE produces innumerable objects: to imitate them, is the province of Genius; to direct tho&s;e imi|tations, is the property of Judgment; to decide on their effects, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of Ta&s;te. For Ta&s;te, who &s;its as &s;upreme judge on the productions of Genius, is not &s;atisfied when &s;he merely imitates Na|ture; &s;he mu&s;t al&s;o, &s;ays an ingenious French writer, imitate <HI>beautiful</HI> Nature. It requires no le&s;s judg|ment to reject than to choo&s;e, and Genius might imi|tate what is vulgar, under pretence that it was na|tural, if Ta&s;te did not carefully point out tho&s;e objects which are mo&s;t proper for imitation. It al&s;o requires a very nice di&s;cernment to di&s;tingui&s;h veri&s;imilitude from truth; for there is a truth in Ta&s;te nearly as conclu&s;ive as demon&s;tration in mathematics.</P>
<P>GENIUS, when in full impetuo&s;ity of its career, often touches on the very brink of error; and is, per|haps, never &s;o near the verge of the precipice, as when indulging its &s;ublime&s;t &s;lights. It is in tho&s;e great, but dangerous moments, that the curb of vigilant judgment is mo&s;t wanting: while &s;afe and &s;ober Dulne&s;s ob&s;erves one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">edions and in&s;ipid round of tire&s;ome uniformity, and &s;teers equally clear of ec|centricity and of beauty. Dulne&s;s has few redun|dancies to retrench, few luxuriancies to prune, and few irregularities to &s;mooth. The&s;e, though errors, are the errors of Genius, for there is rarely redundancy without plenitude, or irregularity without greatne&s;s. The exce&s;&s;es of Genius may ea&s;ily be retrenched, but the deficiencies of Dulne&s;s can never be &s;upplied.</P>
<P>THOSE who copy from others will doubtle&s;s be le&s;s excellent than tho&s;e who copy from Nature. To imi|tate imitators, is the way to depart too far from the great original her&s;elf. The latter copies of an engrav|ing
<PB N="89" REF="019810_0091_0FACB45A0FA17ED0">
retain fainter and fainter traces of the &s;ubject, to which the earlier impre&s;&s;ions bore &s;o &s;trong a re&s;em|blance.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems very extraordinary, that it &s;hould be the mo&s;t difficult thing in the world to be natural; and that it &s;hould be harder to hit off the manners of real life, and to delineate &s;uch characters as we conver&s;e with every day, than to imagine &s;uch as do not exi&s;t. But caricature is much ea&s;ier than an exact outline, and the colouring of fancy le&s;s difficult than that of truth.</P>
<P>PEOPLE do not always know what ta&s;te they have, till it is awakened by &s;ome corre&s;ponding object; nay, genius it&s;elf is a fire, which in many minds would never blaze, if not kindled by &s;ome external cau&s;e.</P>
<P>NATURE, that munificent mother, when &s;he be|&s;tows the power of judging, accompanies it with the capacity of enjoying. The judgment, which is clear &s;ighted, points out &s;uch objects as are calculated to in&s;pire love, and the heart in&s;tantaneou&s;ly attaches it|&s;elf to what&s;oever is lovely.</P>
<P>IN regard to literary reputation, a great deal de|pends on the &s;tate of learning in the particular age or nation, in which an author lives. In a dark and ignorant period, moderate knowledge will entitle its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to a con&s;iderable &s;hare of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame; whereas, to be di&s;tingui&s;hed in a polite and lettered age, requires &s;triking parts and deep erudition.</P>
<P>WHEN a nation begins to emerge from a &s;tate of mental darkne&s;s, and to &s;trike out the fir&s;t rudiments of improvement, it chalks out a few &s;trong but incor|rect &s;ketches, gives the rude out-lines of general art, and leaves the filling up to the lei&s;ure of happier days, and the refinement of more enlightened times. Their drawing is a rude <HI>Sbozzo,</HI> and their poetry wild min&s;trel&s;y.</P>
<P>PERFECTION of ta&s;te is a point which a nation no

&s;ooner reaches, than it over&s;hoots; and it is more difficult to return to it, after having pa&s;&s;ed it, than it was to attain when they fell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hort of it. Where the arts begin to langui&s;h after having flouri&s;hed, they &s;eldom indeed fall back to their original barbari&s;m, but a certain feeblene&s;s of exertion takes place, and it is more difficult to recover them from this dying lang|our to their proper &s;trength, than it was to poli&s;h them from their former rudene&s;s; for it is a le&s;s for|midable undertaking to refine barbarity, than to &s;top decay; the fir&s;t may be laboured into elegance, but the latter will rarely be &s;trengthened into vigour.</P>
<P>TAST<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> exerts it&s;elf at fir&s;t but feebly and imperfect|ly: it is repre&s;&s;ed and kept back by a croud of the mo&s;t di&s;couraging prejudices: like an infant prince, who, though born to reign, yet holds an idle &s;ceptre, which he has not power to u&s;e, but is obliged to &s;ee with the eyes, and hear through the ears of other men.</P>
<P>A WRITER of correct ta&s;te will hardly ever go out of his way, even in &s;earch of embelli&s;hment: he will &s;tudy to attain the be&s;t end by the mo&s;t natural means; for he knows that what is not natural cannot be beautiful, and that nothing can be beautiful out of its own place; for an improper &s;ituation will convert the mo&s;t &s;triking beauty into a glaring defect. When by a well-connected chain of ideas, or a judicious &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events, the reader is &s;natched to "Thebes or Athens," what can be more impertinent than for the poet to ob&s;truct the operation of the pa&s;&s;ion he has ju&s;t been kindling, by introducing a conceit which contradicts his purpo&s;e, and interrupts his bu&s;ine&s;s! Indeed, we cannot be tran&s;ported, even in idea, to tho&s;e places, if the poet does not manage &s;o adroitly as not to make us &s;en&s;ible of the journey: the in&s;tant we feel we are travelling, the writer's art <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ails, and the delirium is at an end.</P>

<P>To conclude; Genius is a rare and precious gem, of which few know the worth; it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itter for the ca|binet of the connoi&s;&s;eur, than for the commerce of mankind. Good &s;en&s;e is a bank-bill, convenient for change, negotiable at all times, and current in all places.

matters of importance, by performing them in the be&s;t manner, and at the mo&s;t &s;uitable &s;ea&s;on.
