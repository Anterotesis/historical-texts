<BIBL><HI>PSALM</HI> LXXXV. II.</BIBL>
<Q>TRUTH SHALL SPRING OUT OF THE EARTH; AND RIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL LOOK DOWN FROM HEAVEN.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is a grandeur and elegancy in the ancient poetry of the Ea&s;t, which, in &s;ome particulars, has been unequalled in modern times. The words which I have read to you include a &s;triking illu&s;tration of the propriety of this remark, in which <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> two of the mo&s;t ex|alted virtues con&s;piring to ennoble the human race, are repre&s;ented as forming both an ea&s;y and a happy junction&mdash;the <HI>one</HI> a&s;cending from <HI>the earth as when &s;he bringeth forth her bud, or from the garden when it cau&s;eth the things that are &s;own in it to &s;pring up</HI>&mdash;the <HI>other</HI> looking down like the benignant &s;un in his daily cour&s;e, directing us by his rays, and refre&s;hing us with his heat.</P>
<P>To a per&s;on of ta&s;te and &s;cience, the recital of the text will, on this account, communicate an elegant plea&s;ure. But when it is con&s;idered that, added to this circum&s;tance, it contains a prophetic declaration
<PB N="6" REF="024287_0004_0FC5E751C78A86D8">
applying to <HI>the &s;tate of man,</HI> we become intere&s;ted in it as a <HI>public body.</HI> On the pre&s;ent agreeable occa&s;ion, it &s;olicits our attention, and will not fail, I hope, to afford us entertainment in our &s;everal &s;tations and capacities as <HI>good &s;oldiers</HI> or as <HI>&s;tate&s;men,</HI> as <HI>philo&s;ophers</HI> and as <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>WILL you permit me to add, I contemplate it with &s;atisfaction, that at the reque&s;t of this <HI>ancient and hon|ourable Company,</HI> I have it in my power to addre&s;s you at a time, when, judging of the &s;tate of improvement, and the revolutions in the world, the prophecy which it contains, &s;eems to be fa&s;t verging to an accom|pli&s;hment.&mdash;Scarcely will it be needful to ob&s;erve that it has an evident relation to the Me&s;&s;iah's reign on earth, embracing &s;ome pro&s;perous condition of things, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing any which has yet appeared, when the knowledge and love of truth, which the P&s;almi&s;t, by a bold and brilliant figure, de&s;cribes as coming from the earth, &s;hall really ari&s;e in the hearts of men, and <HI>the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> look down and &s;mile with ble&s;&s;ings on them.</P>
<P>INDEED beautiful as the text is, it compri&s;es little more than an epitome of the illu&s;trious &s;ignatures of the times it &s;o happily &s;oretels; in which, relying on this and other gracious promi&s;es to the &s;ame effect, we find that knowledge, liberty, peace, holine&s;s, and happine&s;s will univer&s;ally prevail.</P>
<P>IN attempting to perform the duty annexed to the &s;ubject, it will be natural for me then, in the FIRST PLACE, to propo&s;e to you &s;ome of the evi|dences corroborating the text, on which the expecta|tion
<PB N="7" REF="024287_0005_0FC5E7532C38D0E8">
of &s;o glorious an era appears to be founded&mdash;offering &s;ome general remarks concerning the time in which it may be expected. Having done this, I &s;hall SECONDLY con&s;ider the <HI>means</HI> which will prob|ably con&s;pire to its introduction&mdash;&s;ubjoining a few ob&s;ervations on the methods of improving the pre|&s;ent complexion of things in the world at large, and our country in particular.</P>
<P>AMONG the &s;acred references to this important era, the following, which are &s;elected from many others, appear to be &s;ufficiently explicit. <HI>The earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the &s;ea. Wi&s;dom and knowledge &s;hall be the &s;tability of the times. There &s;hall be abundance of peace. They &s;hall beat their &s;words into plough&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning hooks: Nation &s;hall not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, neither &s;hall they learn war any more; for they &s;hall not hurt nor de&s;troy. All the ends of the earth &s;hall remember, and turn unto the Lord. In his days &s;hall the righteous flouri&s;h. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that in the place where it was &s;aid unto them, Ye are not my People, there it &s;hall be &s;aid unto them, Ye are the Sons of the living God. And men &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in him: All nations &s;hall call him ble&s;&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>VARIOUS &s;entiments have been held by commen|tators relating to the <HI>time,</HI> when the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hable prophecies will be fulfilled. Whil&s;t one cla&s;s of writers has dated its exi&s;tence at a &s;ea&s;on prior to the general re&s;urrection or conflagration of the world&mdash;according to the theory of another cla&s;s, it is not to be expected 'till the &s;econd advent of our Saviour on
<PB N="8" REF="024287_0006_0FC5E754BABC5C98">
the great day of judgment; after which, it is &s;up|po&s;ed that the righteous will reign with the Redeemer on the earth, new formed amid&s;t the convul&s;ion which is to pa&s;s upon the &s;y&s;tem, and properly prepared for their reception.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent opportunity will not admit of a par|ticular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject. As it is intere&s;t|ing in its nature, and intimately connected with the bu&s;ine&s;s of the di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall however briefly offer to you a few remarks, inclining me to give the prefe|rence to the former of the&s;e theories.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fir&s;t place,</HI> it is to be a preferred on ac|count of the general complexion of the language u&s;ed by the in&s;pired writers in its numerous repre|&s;entations. When we read of People and of Nations employed in converting their warlike weapons into in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry&mdash;<HI>of the mountains bringing forth peace, and the little hills producing righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxxii. 3.</NOTE> we find our&s;elves tran&s;ported among beings of our own cla&s;s and order&mdash;we mix in tho&s;e &s;cenes which have little or no affinity with the employments of the re&s;urrection &s;tate&mdash;being va&s;tly more allied to the circum&s;tances of the earth in its pre&s;ent &s;ituation, than when it will have been melted and transformed by fire. And whatever allowance may be made for the figurative manner in which the prophetic authors were accu&s;tomed to indite their thoughts, the appli|cation of every metaphor is excluded from this &s;ub|ject by what we learn in reference to the continuance
<PB N="9" REF="024287_0007_0FC5E75ADA9DA4F8">
of the &s;ea&s;on, which the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays will be <HI>as long as the &s;un and the moon &s;hall endure.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the 20th chapter of Revelation we are informed indeed, that, at the clo&s;e of this time, the tranquillity will be interrupted <HI>a little &s;ea&s;on,</HI> by new ene|mies ari&s;ing in various quarters of the earth. But con&s;idering what is added concerning the inefficacy of the attempt, owing to the direct interpo&s;ition of hea|ven in defence of the friends of righteou&s;ne&s;s, immediately preceeding the judg|ment and end of the world, the propriety of the ob&s;ervation &s;till appears, when it is &s;aid of this happy era that it &s;hall la&s;t as long as the &s;un and moon.</NOTE></P>
<P>SECONDLY, the doctrine, I think, is to be inferred, with &s;ome degree of propriety, from a con&s;ideration of the nature and perfection of the divine govern|ment and admini&s;tration over all human affairs.</P>
<P>JUDGING from what appears to have been the de|&s;ign of the Creator, it is not &s;o ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e that a period will be put to the world by judgment and by conflagration, until a change has pa&s;&s;ed on it for the better. Scarcely does it &s;eem &s;ufficient for the gratification of the good man to think that the clouds which have hovered round this terraqueous globe, &s;hould be &s;ucceeded by the brightne&s;s of &s;ome <HI>future</HI> &s;tate. As more honorary, in his e&s;timation, to the Almighty Architect, may it not be expected that the darkne&s;s, which, through divine permi&s;|&s;ion, has been &s;pread over the earth, by the great adver&s;ary of God and man, will be di&s;&s;ipated long before the &s;etting of the &s;un&mdash;that <HI>he</HI> who crept in, by his wiles, into the habitations of men, will event|ually be driven from them, having fir&s;t been con|quered on his own a&s;&s;umed ground&mdash;that where in con&s;equence of his &s;ucce&s;s, innumerable thorns and briars have ri&s;en up, the myrtle tree will put forth its fragrant leaves, and the little &s;hrubs their aromatick fruit&mdash;and that in exchange for <HI>Eden,</HI> once

the happy, but forfeited &s;eat of the two progenitors of mankind, a new paradi&s;e will be formed, which in&s;tead of being circum&s;cribed by the &s;mall bounds, capable of having been traver&s;ed by Adam or by Eve, will be <HI>from &s;ea to &s;ea,</HI> and extend <HI>from the river to the end of the earth.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED of the ri&s;e and glory of &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;h|ed time, we find there has been a general impre&s;&s;ion with many of the mo&s;t refined and poli&s;hed nations of the world. It is the &s;ea&s;on particularly noticed by the ancients under the de&s;criptions of the <HI>golden age</HI>&mdash;<HI>the mighty years</HI>&mdash;<HI>the halcyon days,</HI> progno&s;ti|cated by their common bards, and celebrated by their more refined poets. The <HI>Pollio</HI> of <HI>Virgil</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Said to be taken from a Sibylline prophecy, which, by whatever fraud ob|tained, corroborates the idea of the general expectation of the times of which it &s;peaks.</NOTE> &s;eems as if it had been compo&s;ed with a pointed reference to the di&s;tingui&s;hed circum&s;tances of the important era; in which the writer, no otherwi&s;e mi&s;taken than in the name and title of his profe&s;&s;ed hero, bodly ri&s;es on the lofty &s;trains rehear&s;ed in the imi|tation of the celebrated Pope,&mdash;

<HI>Thus,</HI> as in the &s;eventh day in the fir&s;t &s;acred week, when the Supreme Architect made a pau&s;e, and con|templating what he had produced out of the preceed|ing chaotic &s;tate, pronounced it very good, and &s;anc|tified it to man&mdash;as on the &s;abbatical year in the Jew|i&s;h economy when the land had re&s;t&mdash;<HI>&s;o,</HI> in this prom|i&s;ed time of jubilee, the world &s;hall enjoy an uninter|rupted &s;eries of happine&s;s and compo&s;ure&mdash;the be|neficent and wi&s;e de&s;igns of heaven relating to the pre&s;ent &s;tate, a&s;&s;ume the &s;emblance of winding to a clo&s;e; and the affirmation of the angel to the Evan|geli&s;t be accompli&s;hed, when he &s;aid, that <HI>in the days of the voice of the &s;eventh angel, when he &s;hall begin to &s;ound, the my&s;tery of God &s;hould be fini&s;hed, as he hath de|clared to his &s;ervants the prophets.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. x. 7.&mdash;It is well known that <HI>Seven</HI> is a kind of &s;acred number in the &s;criptures, &s;ignifying in the &s;everal revolutions and divi&s;ions of time, a &s;ea&s;on of religion and re&s;t. For further particulars and their application to this &s;ubject, the reader in referred to Loman and other commentators on the prophecies.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the SECOND divi&s;ion of the di&s;cour&s;e, it was propo&s;ed to con&s;ider the <HI>means,</HI> leading to the intro|duction of this au&s;picious day. Among the&s;e, I con|ceive that the progre&s;s of &s;cience in the world, holds a con&s;picuous rank. De&s;potic governments, with their concomitant evils, always maintain their &s;trength proportionate to the degrees of ignorance among the people. The dominion of tyranny is properly &s;peaking a dominion of <HI>darkne&s;s</HI>&mdash;&s;upported by the impo&s;ition of <HI>fal&s;ehood</HI> under the pretended ve&s;tiges of <HI>truth</HI>&mdash;enervating the mental powers of human beings, and degrading them from the rank of men. Terrible in its external form, but ba&s;e with|in, it may be compared with the image in Nebu|chadnezzar's
<PB N="12" REF="024287_0010_0FC5E766F665C030">
vi&s;ion, the head of which was of gold, but the feet of iron, mixed with rotten clay.&mdash;Again&s;t this, the kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah is pro|fe&s;&s;edly introduced, which, like the &s;tone cut out of the mountain without hands, will eventually overthrow the u&s;urping idol, and maintain its place for ever. Indeed, unlike the kingdoms of this world, it is of a &s;piritual nature&mdash;de&s;igned to illumi|nate the under&s;tandings, and regulate the affections of its &s;ubjects. By informing them for what pur|po&s;es they were &s;ent into the world&mdash;enjoining a &s;upreme veneration to the great Author of their be|ing, and next to this, and affectionate regard to one another, as children of the &s;ame eternal Father&mdash;par|takers of the like wants, and brethren of one com|mon family, it is eminently calculated to meliorate the events which may be expected by them in human life, until they are fir&s;t prepared, and afterward tran&s;|lated to heaven. It is the kingdom which God has given to his Son&mdash;the laws by which it is governed&mdash;the promi&s;es which give it life, and the &s;anctions ad|mini&s;tring to its &s;upport, being written by Prophets and Apo&s;tles in&s;pired for the honourable work, and guided by a hand which is divine.</P>
<P>WITH much rea&s;on it might be expected, that principles thus pure in them&s;elves, and friendly to the common benefit of mankind, would be di&s;reli&s;h|ed by de&s;pots and their dependants, who&s;e object is a monopoly of power, as it is of grandeur and wealth. Either therefore by a direct denial of the authenticity of the &s;acred &s;criptures, or by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of
<PB N="13" REF="024287_0011_0FC5E76E0A6ADAD8">
religious hierarchies, profe&s;&s;edly a&s;&s;i&s;ting, but actu|ally &s;ubverting their operation, a great part of the governments which have hitherto exi&s;ted in the world, have united with meretricious zeal. From &s;uch powerful cau&s;es, aided no doubt by the moral depravity annexted to human nature in general, throw|ing a veil before the intellectual vi&s;ion, it has come to pa&s;s that the progre&s;s of religious &s;cience has, for many ages, been comparatively &s;mall. But the in|tere&s;t of mankind is too deeply concerned, to allow &s;uch licentious impo&s;itions to remain perpetual. The enlarged cultivation of the art of printing, by which the mild and equitable principles of our re|ligion become more generally known&mdash;the great in|crea&s;e of commerce, introducing man to an ac|quaintance with his fellow man&mdash;the burdens inci|dent to tyrannical governments, with the public bankruptcies which are threatened in con&s;equence of the wanton wars concerted through the meer ambition of &s;tate&s;men and of princes, will no doubt, con&s;pire in time, to produce alarms, where de&s;po|ti&s;m now prevails, occa&s;ioning many revolutions, in which the people will judge it prudent to take the lead.</P>
<P>FORESEEING the&s;e things, it has plea&s;ed the benev|olent Creator of the world, plainly to foretel that the time will certainly come when mankind univer&s;ally &s;hall be free. And he has foretold it, not only as a probable event, re&s;ulting from an application of the truths of revealed writ to the general benefit of &s;oci|ety, but as that, which by his wi&s;e and holy provi|dence,
<PB N="14" REF="024287_0012_0FC5E774F81EAB30">
he is determined to bring to pa&s;s. The lan|guage in which he has a&s;&s;erted it is, <HI>I the Lord will perform it.</HI> In the government of the world, he no doubt, acts by means&mdash;making u&s;e of the rea&s;on and abilities of his creatures in the accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;e de&s;igns. Acquainted with the&s;e means, and rea&s;oning from analogy, we may often judge of their operation with a great degree of probability and pre|ci&s;ion. But there would be an uncertainty attending all human things, were they to be left unaided by the concurrent influence of a divine and overruling Mind. By ways and methods which are often out of &s;ight by <HI>us,</HI> but perfectly coincident with the well known and e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrine of the moral liberty and free agency of man, the purpo&s;es of infi|nite Wi&s;dom are brought to view. In expectation of the joyful jubilee on which we are now contem|plating, we may therefore rely not only on the prob|able conjunction of natural cau&s;es and effects, but more &s;urely on the divine promi&s;e certifying the event, and making it the proper object of a rational and yet implicit faith. Thus &s;upported by the uni|ted aids of rea&s;on and revelation&mdash;to the plea&s;ure, we add the triumph of our faith, in anticipating the happy era, when, in every nation under heaven, <HI>the eyes of the blind will be opened, to relea&s;e the pri&s;oners from their pri&s;on, and them that &s;it in darkne&s;s from the pri&s;on-hou&s;e</HI>&mdash;<HI>when the broken-hearted &s;hall be comforted, and liberty proclaimed to the captive</HI>&mdash;<HI>they that erred in &s;pirit, being brought to under&s;tanding, and they that mur|mured to &s;ound doctrine.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="024287_0013_0FC5E778BAAAE008">
IN the preceeding ob&s;ervations, the view which we have taken, has been principally confined to the emancipation of mankind from the &s;hackles of op|pre&s;&s;ion, and the emporium of rea&s;on in every nation of the world. A more important article included in this promi&s;ed era, is that of the univer&s;al prevalency of <HI>religion;</HI> which, as it will be productive of the peaceful &s;tate &s;o beautifully de&s;cribed by the pro|phetic writers, will operate, with like &s;ucce&s;s, to complete the happine&s;s and glory of the times.</P>
<P>ARGUING from the maxims already propo&s;ed, it is ea&s;y to conceive that at lea&s;t there may be a decided conviction of the value of political liberty, and a general &s;truggle in its behalf, where the knowledge of religions in its &s;pirituality and truth is by no means univer&s;al in its operation. The idea of <HI>intere&s;t alone,</HI> re&s;ulting from the improvements made in &s;ociety by experience and by time, may be &s;ufficiently operative in the production of very a&s;toni&s;hing changes in the political world. Whil&s;t we are at no lo&s;s therefore in accounting for the exi&s;tence of &s;uch changes in the former of the&s;e articles, we &s;eem to be under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of examining &s;till further for the cau&s;e of the latter.</P>
<P>AND this I conceive to be no other than the ani|mating influence of the Divine Spirit, which, when to an&s;wer the wi&s;e purpo&s;es for which the Deity gave permi&s;&s;ion, the my&s;tery of iniquity will have &s;uffici|ently worked&mdash;the weakne&s;s of all error been detect|ed, and the force of moral principles obtained at lea&s;t a &s;peculative triumph, he will then plentifully com|municate
<PB N="16" REF="024287_0014_0FC5E77A4DBC53B0">
to the world; and thus, by refining the minds of men, will confirm them in the belief of re|ligious truth&mdash;by meliorating their di&s;po&s;itions, in|&s;ure to them the enjoyment of liberty and peace&mdash;and by &s;anctifying their hearts, prepare them for the reception of every ble&s;&s;ing they can enjoy both here, and for ever hereafter.</P>
<P>THEN &s;hall the reign of virtue&mdash;the expected time of re&s;t&mdash;the promi&s;ed Sabbath&mdash;the Me&s;&s;iah's king|dom on earth, be happily con&s;ummated; and the ancient prophecy of Daniel, comprehending many others of more recent date, advance to its complete fulfilment&mdash;<HI>I &s;aw in the night vi&s;ions, and behold one like the Son of Man, came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations and lan|guages &s;hould &s;erve him: his dominion is an everla&s;ting dominion which &s;hall not pa&s;s away, and his kingdom that which &s;hall not be de&s;troyed.</HI></P>
<P>PROCEEDING now from general principles to their application, it may be proper in this place, to take a view of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety in the world, and enquire in what progre&s;s it appears to be toward the enjoyment of the expected ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;&s;o far e&s;|pecially as relates to the articles of knowledge and liberty, which according to the account that has been given, will be progre&s;&s;ive in their operation, preceeding the univer&s;al prevalency of religion which will crown the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="024287_0015_0FC5E77BADAEA420">
AND I mu&s;t take occa&s;ion here to congratulate my re&s;pected hearers, not only on the pre&s;ent political &s;tate of their country, but on the circum&s;tance of their having lived in an age, when, as among the heavenly bodies, a newly di&s;covered planet, through the penetration of an <HI>Her&s;chel,</HI> was added to the &s;y&s;|tem of which the earth is part, &s;o the United States of America, by a mighty movement in the great order of human things, were at the &s;ame time brought forward to the admiring gaze of all the &s;ons of free|dom, and amid&s;t their acclamations, took rank among the nations of the world.</P>
<P>IT will be needle&s;s to attempt the recital of the remarkable &s;cenes accompanying the proce&s;&s;ion of this great event. With tho&s;e who now hear me, and have borne no incon&s;iderable part, as &s;tate&s;men in projecting&mdash;as &s;oliders by confirming, and as phi|lanthropi&s;ts in contemplating them, their memory will be coequal with the duration of life. The prin|cipal bu&s;ine&s;s before us is the con&s;ideration of their effects.

<P>PERHAPS it may be thought a mi&s;take, but I &s;hall notwith&s;tanding venture to ob&s;erve, that, con&s;ider|ing the degree of political knowledge prevailing in America, it appears to me to be next to impo&s;&s;ible that tyranny &s;hould ever be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the United States. The &s;entiment, it is pre&s;umed, is founded on the rea&s;on and nature of things: But if the pre|ceeding con&s;truction of the &s;cripture promi&s;es be true, it is removed &s;till further from the admi&s;&s;ion of di&s;pute.</P>

FOR my&s;elf therefore I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I look forward, without the lea&s;t anxiety on this article, and anticipate many &s;ucceeding generations, each of them illu&s;trious for a happy race of freemen. It does not follow however, that we are to expect a complete exemption from political evils. In the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate of human nature, a revolution in the government may not only be productive of a nece&s;&s;ary change of <HI>duties,</HI> but in &s;ome re&s;pects, of a change of <HI>dangers.</HI> There will every where be &s;ini&s;ter and &s;ordid men, who, when de&s;irous of places of emolument or honour, will be le&s;s anxious con|cerning the means, than the certainty of their at|tainment. The&s;e are the time-&s;ervers and the &s;ycophants, who, in monarchical governments, will &s;urround the court, or be &s;een cringing within the vortex of the throne; and in the governments which are more popular, will be equally bu&s;y, fluttering and negotiating, on all &s;ides, in the a&s;&s;emblies of the people. The object of their attraction is the &s;ame in one as in the other &s;ituation: It is the power of &s;erving and promoting <HI>them,</HI> which, whether it be lodged in <HI>many</HI> or in a <HI>few,</HI> like the &s;hrines of De|metrius, will be &s;ure of commanding a great croud of adorers, crying, though in more modernized lan|guage, <HI>Great is Diana of the Ephe&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>CONSIDERING this &s;ubject with the attention it de&s;erves, may it not then, with propriety, be con|cluded, that one of the mo&s;t certain means produc|tive of the &s;afety and happine&s;s of a people, con&s;i&s;ts in their ability to di&s;tingui&s;h and find out di&s;inte|re&s;ted

It is ju&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary in republicks, that the congratulatory addre&s;s &s;hould be to <HI>liberty</HI> and the <HI>con&s;titution. Liberty</HI> is one of the noble&s;t of all the birthrights, which a wi&s;e and rational man can wi&s;h. But whil&s;t the intere&s;ted, as well as the di&s;intere&s;ted, may equally profe&s;s to be within the number of its votaries, the inhabitants of the&s;e States will no doubt di&s;cover the nece&s;&s;ity of committing the protections of their laws and privileges to <HI>approved patriots</HI>&mdash;judiciou&s;ly guarding again&s;t the arts of tho&s;e who meerly addre&s;s them&s;elves to the popular feelings of a day, thereby enfeebling the &s;ocial com|pact&mdash;and pre&s;erving a ju&s;t re&s;pect for the political &s;entiments which are frank and undi&s;gui&s;ed, having been formed on an acquaintance with the hi&s;tory of government in the world, exhibiting the various occa&s;ions of the ri&s;e and fall of nations, te&s;ti&s;ied by rea&s;on, and confirmed by indubitable experience.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help adding a remark or two, in this place, on the &s;ubject of religion. The unju&s;tifiable influence of the Church, with the unbounded power of its dignitaries and other prie&s;ts, in various parts of Europe, has had the unhappy effect of occa&s;ion|ing much infidelity with great numbers of the laity, who, from their wealth and &s;tation in life, profe&s;s to think freely, or without &s;ubjection to exterior con|trol;
<PB N="23" REF="024287_0021_0FC5E7918B0ADBC8">
and as this influence is now continually di|mini&s;hing, even with the other ranks and cla&s;&s;es of the people, it is probable that, in a few years, the intere&s;ts of religion will undergo a more material convul&s;ion, the con&s;equences of which will very generally be perceived and known. Certainly there is much weakne&s;s in refu&s;ing to admit the evidence of truth owing to the errors and mi&s;conduct of a part of tho&s;e who are its profe&s;&s;ed abettors. The various enormities, both in the doctrines and prac|tices of many churches, were really to be expected, becau&s;e they were long ago foretold by the great Author of our Religion; and every argument of this kind, was thus completely wre&s;ted from the cau&s;e of infidelity.</P>
<P>BUT whatever may have been the bad effects of &s;uch religious impo&s;itions in &s;everal of the nations in Europe, it is hoped they will not extend to the citizens of America. For the credit of religion, it is no more than rea&s;onable to ob&s;erve, that among the promoters of the Revolution in this country, there is no cla&s;s of per&s;ons who have been more indefati|gable in their &s;tations than the body of the clergy&mdash;explicitly declaring their di&s;approbation of all re|ligious e&s;tabli&s;hments&mdash;thus committing their tem|poral intere&s;t to the governance of the people&mdash;a&s;&s;uming no influence but &s;uch as might ari&s;e from the general manner of their lives, and &s;erious per|formance of the duties of their office&mdash;hereby re|moving every occa&s;&s;ion of di&s;tru&s;t and jealou&s;y again&s;t their order, and offering them&s;elves, on well-known
<PB N="24" REF="024287_0022_0FC5E79538243140">
principles, as the con&s;tant candidates for the friend|&s;hip and e&s;teem of tho&s;e whom they profe&s;s to &s;erve. What the con&s;equence <HI>has</HI> been, where the Church and State have been blended together, as in &s;ome countries, is already di&s;covered. What the con&s;e|quence <HI>may</HI> be, in relation to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem adopted in America, le&s;s than half a century now before us, will clearly determine. In the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the national &s;y&s;tem of government, it is a matter, I conceive, which is worthy of attention. Whil&s;t the clergy have no intere&s;t cla&s;hing with that of the laity's, but the &s;acred offices of religion are engaged in by the former from a &s;incere apprehen|&s;ion of their importance, and &s;uitably encouraged by the latter from the like faith and motives, it may be pre&s;umed that the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects will be experienced by the community. In attempting to lay the foundation for the happine&s;s of po&s;terity, it is not only wi&s;e and virtuous, but ab&s;olutely requi|&s;ite, to call in the united aids of morality and re|ligion. Never were the pro&s;pects of any people more promi&s;ing and glorious than tho&s;e of the in|habitants of the&s;e States, or the means and capacity greater for rendering them &s;ucce&s;sful. Con&s;equen|tial on the exertions productive of the Revolution in America, the mental abilities of her &s;ons &s;eem to have been brought forward at an earlier period than is u&s;ual, and to have expanded to a fuller growth. From the contemplation of the va&s;t &s;cenes through which we pa&s;&s;ed during the war, and the great and important bu&s;ine&s;s which has been tran&s;|acted
<PB N="25" REF="024287_0023_0FC5E797CC00E040">
&s;ince the peace, there is an energy of mind, and a genius characteri&s;tical of Americans, which, like a the Eagle in the e&s;cutcheon of the National Arms, delights it&s;elf in &s;oaring high, and behold|ing objects which are great as well as deep. What tends &s;till further to the growth of this mental in|vigoration, is the knowledge of the va&s;t capaciou&s;|ne&s;s of the territory belonging to the United States, already increa&s;ing in population with the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing repidity, and in like manner improving in the arts. It is to be expected that the &s;ucceeding age will make progre&s;&s;ion both in agriculture and &s;cience, which, if it were po&s;&s;ible for us to behold it, would in&s;pire our minds with equal wonder and delight. On the excur&s;ive pinions of imagination, we will now take the view. Roving by the peren|nial fountains, or on the verdant banks of the me|andring &s;treams, we perceive the bu&s;y hu&s;bandman employed in gathering the rich bounties of <HI>Ceres</HI> and <HI>Pomona</HI>&mdash;the hills around him vocal with the mu|&s;ick of his bleating flocks&mdash;the meads and vallies blooming like the ro&s;e.

if, in the cour&s;e of human events, there &s;hould ever be the nece&s;&s;ity of taking the field again.
