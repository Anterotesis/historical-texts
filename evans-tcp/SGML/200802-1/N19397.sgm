<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MY original intention, when I began to write the "&s;hort account of the malignant fever lately prevalent in Philadelphia," w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> mere|ly to give a detail of its effects on &s;ociety, con|&s;idered in a moral view, and to collect the mo&s;t &s;triking facts that occurred in the progre&s;s of a calamity, that di&s;played human nature in a point of light new to mo&s;t of our citizens. I de&s;igned to avoid all enquiries that might lead to medical di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and therefore not to touch upon the origin, &s;ymptoms, or treatment of the di&s;ea&s;e. This determination I changed on finding how very imperfect the pamphlet would be, without &s;ome &s;ketch on tho&s;e points.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="025254_0004_0FCCED1916386290">
With re&s;pect to the origin of the di&s;order, I was and am in favour of the prevailing opini|on, that it was imported. I gave a &s;tatement of &s;uch arguments on both &s;ides of the que&s;|tion, as had made their appearance in the pa|pers. I was very de&s;irous of being able to in|troduce tho&s;e which dr. Ru&s;h had long be|fore declared, he could advance in &s;upport of his opinion. But in the three editions of my little work which have appeared, it has been out of my power to gratify this de&s;ire; as the doctor's e&s;&s;ay on the &s;ubject made its fir&s;t ap|pearance on Wedne&s;day la&s;t.</P>
<P>As therefore I had no opportunity of ani|madverting on this e&s;&s;ay in the former pam|phlet, it will not, I hope, be judged impro|per to attempt a refutation of the doctor's ar|guments in a &s;eparate publication.</P>
<P>My rea&s;on for the&s;e preliminary ob&s;erva|tions, is, to apologize for (what might other|wi&s;e appear pre&s;umption) my interfering in a que&s;tion which appears out of my &s;phere, and to belong exclu&s;ively to the gentlemen of the faculty.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="025254_0005_0FCCD92292B496E8">
The fir&s;t po&s;ition laid down by dr. Ru&s;h, is, <Q>that the yellow fever in the We&s;t Indies is always generated by vegetable putrefaction.</Q> This is not well founded. Dr. Hillary makes no mention of vegetable putrefaction produc|ing this di&s;order. He a&s;cribes it to the peculiar temperament and habits of living of the &s;ub|jects of it. "It is very remarkable," &s;ays he, <Q>that this fever mo&s;t commonly &s;eizes &s;tran|gers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who come from a col|der or more temperate climate&mdash;and mo&s;t readily tho&s;e who u&s;e vinous or &s;piritous liquors too freely; and &s;till more readily tho&s;e who labour hard, or u&s;e too violent exerci&s;e, and are at the &s;ame time expo&s;ed to the &s;corching rays of the &s;un in the day time, and &s;oon after expo&s;e them&s;elves too &s;uddenly to the cool dews and damp air of the night.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hillary on di&s;ea&s;es of Barbadoes, page 146.</NOTE> Dr. Lind gives the &s;ame account, and nearly in the &s;ame words.</P>
<P>Dr. Mo&s;ely, who is the late&s;t and the be&s;t writer on this fever, makes no mention, as far
<PB N="8" REF="025254_0006_0FCCED1E6D0DA548">
as I could di&s;cover, and I examined his book with &s;ome care, of its ari&s;ing from vegetable putrefaction in the We&s;t Indies, nor of any particular &s;ea&s;on in which it prevails. He &s;peaks of it as one of the &s;ea&s;oning di&s;orders to which new-comers are &s;ubject, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a plethoric habit, and tho&s;e who live irre|gularly. If it aro&s;e from the &s;ource to which dr. Ru&s;h a&s;cribes it, dr. Mo&s;ely would not certainly have neglected to mention the fact.</P>
<P>But even admitting the po&s;ition, that it ari&s;es from vegetable putrefaction, it by no means follows that it was generated here. Indeed, I cannot &s;ee that this argument is in any man|ner whatever applicable to the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Dr. Ru&s;h's &s;econd po&s;ition is, that <Q>&s;imilar degrees of heat are capable of producing it in every part of the world.</Q> This is, if po&s;&s;i|ble, more unfounded than the fir&s;t. Dr. Hillary expre&s;sly &s;ays: <Q>It does not appear, from the mo&s;t accurate ob&s;ervations of the variations of the weather, or any difference of the &s;ea|&s;ons, which I have been able to make for &s;everal years pa&s;t, that this fever is any way
<PB N="9" REF="025254_0007_0FCCED1FE702E488">
cau&s;ed, or much influenced by them; for I have &s;een it at all times, and in all &s;ea&s;ons, in the coole&s;t, as well as in the hotte&s;t time of the year.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibidem.</NOTE></P>
<P>To the &s;ame purpo&s;e, Dr. Lining ob&s;erves, <Q>This fever does not &s;eem to take its origin from any particular con&s;titution of the wea|ther, independent of infectious mia&s;mata, as dr. Warren has formerly well ob&s;erved; for within the&s;e twenty-five years, it has been on|ly four times epidemical in this town, name|ly in the autumns of the years 1732, 39, 45, and 48, though none of tho&s;e years, (except|ing that of 1739, who&s;e &s;ummer and autumn were remarkably rainy) were either warmer or more rainy, (and &s;ome of them le&s;s &s;o) than the &s;ummers and autumns were in &s;eve|ral other years, in which we had not one in|&s;tance of any one &s;eized with this fever; which is contrary to what would have hap|pened, <HI>if particular con&s;titutions of the wea|ther, were producttive of it,</HI> without infectious mia&s;mata<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ays and ob&s;ervations, political and literary, vol. II. page 406, 407.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="025254_0008_0FCCED2165B54260">
The doctor's third divi&s;ion of his e&s;&s;ay, contains the&s;e facts. <Q>A quantity of damaged coffee was expo&s;ed at a time (July 14th) and in a place (on a wharf, and in a dock) which highly favoured its putrefaction. Its &s;mell was highly putrid and offen&s;ive; &s;o that the inhabitants of the hou&s;es in Water and Front &s;treet, which were near it were obliged to exclude it by &s;hutting their doors and win|dows.</Q> The&s;e circum&s;tances are all true, but they do not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e intended. Whoever con&s;ults the ingenious and intere&s;ting experiments made by dr. Alexander, will &s;ee that putrid vegetable matters are &s;o far from being the &s;ources of putrid di&s;orders, that they are very powerful anti&s;eptics. As the book is &s;carce, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe his account of one of his curious experiments.</P>
<P><Q>I reduced a quantity of cabbage leaves to a pulp in a mortar, and &s;et them in a warm place to putrify. A bowl of &s;trawberries was likewi&s;e &s;et along with them. When both the cabbage leaves and &s;trawberries had undergone a fermentation, and were in that &s;tate in which vegetables are &s;aid to be pu|trid,
<PB N="11" REF="025254_0009_0FCCED245E960078">
I put a bit of mutton into each of them, and covered it over with the pulp. Another bit was put into a bowl of water for a &s;tan|dard, and they were all &s;et together in a warm clo&s;et. The piece of mutton in the water had evidently turned putrid, and tinged the water red in one night. Both that piece which was in the pulp <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f the cabbage, and that in the pulp of the &s;trawberries, were kept three weeks, and continued &s;weet and hard, as if they had been &s;alted. The bowls were then overturned, and their contents lo&s;t by acci|dent. From the&s;e experiments it appears, that neither the putrid &s;ub&s;tance, nor the watry infu&s;ion of vegetables, is &s;eptic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alexander's experimental enquiry, 53&mdash;4.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>In this divi&s;ion of his &s;ubject, dr. Ru&s;h pro|duces &s;everal in&s;tances of malignant di&s;orders &s;aid to have been generated by putrid vegetable &s;ub&s;tances; and among the re&s;t, quotes Lanci|&s;is. Of this author's want of penetration, dr. Alexander makes the following very judicious
<PB N="12" REF="025254_0010_0FCCED26B54FEB30">
ob&s;ervation; <Q>Whoever reads the ob&s;erva|tions of Lanci&s;is with attention, will &s;ee that the greate&s;t part of the putrid epidemics which he mentions, always followed remarkable inundations of the Tyber; and &s;everal of them &s;ooner than the water, left by tho&s;e inundations, could have become putrid; &s;o that all, or the greater part of the pu|trid di&s;ea&s;es a&s;cribed by Lanci&s;is to mar&s;h mia&s;mata, may be fairly attributed to the effect of moi&s;ture alone, independent of any mixture of putrid effluvia.</Q></P>
<P>The doctor proceeds: <Q>The rapid progre&s;s of the fever from Water &s;treet, and the cour&s;es through which it travelled into other parts of the city, afford a &s;trong evi|dence, that it was at fir&s;t propagated chiefly by exhalations from the putrid coffee.</Q></P>
<P>This argument applies with equal force ei|ther to the generation or to the importation of the di&s;order; for as the ve&s;&s;els by which we have the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to believe it was in|troduced, were moored near the wharf where the coffee lay, it is obvious, that, whether im|ported
<PB N="13" REF="025254_0011_0FCCED28DF74BC00">
or generated, it mu&s;t have been driven through every adjacent avenue according to the direction in which the wind blew.</P>
<P>The doctor's fifth po&s;ition is, that <Q>many per&s;ons who had worked, or even vi&s;ited in the neighbourhood of the exhalation from the coffee, early in the month of Au|gu&s;t, were indi&s;po&s;ed afterwards with &s;ick|ne&s;s, puking, and yellow &s;weats, long be|fore the air of Water &s;treet was &s;o much impregnated with the contagion, as to pro|duce &s;uch effects.</Q> This argument &s;tands on preci&s;ely the &s;ame ground as the former one. For the exi&s;tence of the di&s;order in that &s;pot, mu&s;t have produced the &s;ame effect in ei|ther ca&s;e, whether imported or indigenous.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth po&s;ition is: <Q>The &s;tricte&s;t en|quiry, accompanied with the greate&s;t &s;olici|tude for proofs, has not been able to di&s;co|ver any other cau&s;e of our late epidemic. Every account of the importation of the "di&s;ea&s;e, has been di&s;covered, upon examina|tion, to be inaccurate, contradictory, and without foundation. The fir&s;t ca&s;es of the
<PB N="14" REF="025254_0012_0FCCED2A66D9F7F8">
yellow fever have been clearly traced to the &s;ailors of the ve&s;&s;el who were fir&s;t ex|po&s;ed to the effluvia of the coffee. Their &s;ickne&s;s commenced with the day on which the coffee began to emit its putrid &s;mell. The di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread with the increa&s;e of the poi&s;onous exhalations.</Q></P>
<P>Amid&s;t the confu&s;ion in which this &s;ubject is involved&mdash;amid&s;t the difficulty of producing po&s;itive proof<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some of the per&s;ons who could throw full light on this &s;ubject, are dead&mdash;others removed away&mdash;and there are &s;ome who would not choo&s;e to reveal the truth from an unwillingne&s;s to engage in any controver&s;y.</NOTE>&mdash;let us enquire into the evi|dence. Let us &s;ee whether the opinion of its generation be not much more improbable than that of its importation&mdash;let us &s;ee whether the pre&s;umptions in &s;upport of the latter opinion be not &s;o extremely &s;trong, as fully to &s;atisfy every mind open to conviction.</P>
<P>That &s;everal per&s;ons arrived in this city in the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer, &s;ick with the ma|lignant fever, is beyond que&s;tion. There were,
<PB N="15" REF="025254_0013_0FCCED2C4F046410">
early in Augu&s;t, &s;everal &s;ick people on board the Flora, as appears by the publication of drs&punc; Cuthrie and Cathrall. Many per&s;ons have been landed out of ve&s;&s;els coming to this port, at different places on the banks of the Delaware, who afterwards died of the yellow fever; and &s;everal dead bodies have been buried along the &s;hore.</P>
<P>About the end of July, mr. John Ma&s;&s;ey of this city, was at Marcus Hook, where a woman from Cape Francois had been landed, and had died of the yellow fever. Some French people who lived near the place of her death, and knew the di&s;order of which &s;he died, burned a quan|tity of tar at the door, to purify the air.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time in July, as this affair happened at Marcus Hook, captain, Hamilton Sage, from St. Domingo, was landed in a very low &s;tate at Che&s;ter, in the evening, and died next morning at four o'clock. His &s;ickne&s;s was of only five days. His &s;kin had all the yellow|ne&s;s, and livid &s;pots that characteri&s;ed our late epidemic. Information of this latter fact I have had from a letter written by dr. William Mar|tin,
<PB N="16" REF="025254_0014_0FCCED2F54E64BC8">
to a gentleman of the faculty in this city, who was kind enough to allow me to avail my&s;elf of the information it contained.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle fact, of this kind, would give to the opinion of its importation that high de|gree of probability, which is nearly all the nature of the ca&s;e allows; for the clothes, or bedding of either of the&s;e per&s;ons would be &s;ufficient to &s;pread the di&s;order, if we rea&s;on from the experience of 1762.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh po&s;ition of dr. Ru&s;h, is: <Q>It has been remarked that this fever did not &s;pread in the country, when carried there by per&s;ons who were infected, and who after|wards died with it. This, I conceive, was oc|ca&s;ioned in part by the contagion being de|prived of the aid of mia&s;mata from the pu|trid matter which fir&s;t produced it in our city, and in part by its being diluted, and thereby weakened by the pure air of the country. During four times in which it pre|vailed in Charle&s;ton, in no one in&s;tance, ac|cording to dr. Lining, was it propagated in any other part of the &s;tate.</Q> This argument,
<PB N="17" REF="025254_0015_0FCCED3292BE2438">
by which the doctor doubtle&s;s intended to &s;up|port his hypothe&s;is, if it an&s;wers any pupo&s;e, militates very &s;trongly again&s;t him. The yel|low fever of Charle&s;ton did not &s;pread into the country&mdash;neither did ours. Yet the former was confe&s;&s;edly imported. If, therefore, any infe|rence is to be drawn from this fact, it undubi|tably is, that ours was likewi&s;e imported.</P>
<P>The eighth po&s;ition of dr. Ru&s;h, is: <Q>It is very remarkable that in the hi&s;tories of the di&s;order, which have been pre&s;erved in this country, it has <HI>&s;even</HI> times appeared about the fir&s;t or middle of Augu&s;t, and declined, or cea&s;ed about the middle of October&mdash;viz. in 1732, 1739, 1745, and 1748 in Charle&s;|ton&mdash;in 1791 in New York, and in 1762 and 1793 in Philadelphia. This frequent occurrence of the yellow fever at the u&s;ual period of our common bilious remittents, cannot be a&s;cribed to accidental coincidence, but mu&s;t be re&s;olved, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, into the combination of more active mia&s;mata with the predi&s;po&s;ition of a tropical &s;ea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>Of the &s;even times in which this di&s;order ap|peared in America, five have been unque&s;tion|ably
<PB N="18" REF="025254_0016_0FCCED3364173260">
by importation, viz. four times in Char|le&s;ton, and the former time here, to &s;ay no|thing of our late misfortune. The&s;e in&s;tances mu&s;t have ari&s;en from an <Q>accidental coin|cidence;</Q> and could not po&s;&s;ibly have de|pended on "the predi&s;po&s;ition of a tropical &s;ea&s;on." Moreover, the arguments advanced from Hillary and Lining, in page 8 and 9, effectually de&s;troy this po&s;ition, even if the facts were as &s;tated.</P>
<P>"Several circum&s;tances," continues dr. Ru&s;h, <Q>attended the late epidemic, which do not occur in the We&s;t India yellow fever. It affected children, as well as adults, in common with our annual bilious fevers. Dr. Hume tells us, it never attacked any per&s;on under puberty.</Q></P>
<P>The yellow fever, even in the We&s;t Indies, is not always uniform in its &s;ymptoms or ef|fects&mdash;and on its introduction here, may ve|ry readily be &s;uppo&s;ed to have changed its ap|pearance. Dr. Lind, who, like dr. Lining, is unexceptionable authority on this &s;ubject, after detailing the arguments for and again&s;t the
<PB N="19" REF="025254_0017_0FCCED34E1FD2C00">
contagious nature of the di&s;order, &s;ays: <Q>We can only reconcile the facts that may be pro|duced on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, by &s;uppo&s;ing that the yellow fever of the We&s;t Indies is &s;ometimes of a mild nature, and al|together free from infection, while at other times it is more violent and highly infecti|ous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The different appearance of the &s;ame di&s;order, in different per&s;ons and places, is noted by Lind: <Q>From one cau&s;e, from the &s;ame infection, I have fre|quently known to proceed what may be termed, from outward appearances, the yellow, petechial, and mili|ary fevers; and while in a few the contagion a&s;&s;umed an intermitting form, and was mild, in others it raged with a con&s;tant fever.</Q> Lind on the health of &s;eamen, page 265.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>One more ob&s;ervation of dr. Ru&s;h's, it may be proper to notice. He &s;ays: <Q>I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe that the in&s;tances of the yellow fever being imported, are <HI>very few,</HI> compar|ed with tho&s;e of its being generated in our country.</Q> Five times out of &s;even, as I have already ob&s;erved, it was confe&s;&s;edly imported&mdash;and in the other two in&s;tances of its appear|ance,
<PB N="20" REF="025254_0018_0FCCED3847AA5378">
viz. at New York, 1791, and here this year, its origination in this country is by no means admitted. In New York, it was attri|buted to the exhalations from &s;ome putrid mud&mdash;although the &s;ame kind of mud was at other docks, without producing any effect what|ever. Surely then it is improper to a&s;&s;ert that the in&s;tances of its importation are <HI>few.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall now clo&s;e this &s;ubject. The reader has &s;een that Hillary and Lining declare po&s;itively that this di&s;order does not depend on the wea|ther<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Bruce, an eminent phy&s;ician of Barbadoes, quot|ed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nd is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ame opinion: <Q>In omni anni tem|pe&s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">rt hic morbus&punc; &s;ymptomata autem gra|viera ob&s;erv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ntur, ubi calor magnus cum multa humi|di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate conjungitur.</Q> Lind on hot climates, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">7.</NOTE>&mdash;and Lind and Mo&s;ely imply the &s;ame thing by their &s;ilence&mdash;yet that dr.
