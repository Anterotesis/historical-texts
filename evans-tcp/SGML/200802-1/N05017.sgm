<HEAD>A Brief Account OF THE <HI>Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;ent State</HI> OF THE Paper Currency of NEW-ENGLAND. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE whole My&s;tery of Money, Trade, Exchange, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> has been di&s;cover'd and &s;et in a very clear Light by Mr. LOCKE, who, as one of his Corre&s;pondents ob&s;erves to him, open'd the Eyes of the World, which, until he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wrote, had us'd Money as Indians do Wampum, it &s;erv'd them for buying and &s;elling, and they con&s;ider'd it no farther. Among other Things, he remarks, That,
<Q>Suppo&s;ing any I&s;land, &s;eparate from the re&s;t of Mankind, whatever is their Money, if they have but a certain Quantity, and can get no more, it will be a <HI>&s;teady &s;tanding Mea&s;ure of the Value of all other Things</HI>; but this, he &s;ays, is a Suppo&s;ition that is not like to be found in the Practice of Mankind, &s;ince Navigation and Commerce have brought all Coun|tries acquainted with one another, and introduced the U&s;e of Gold and Silver Money into all trading Parts of the World; and it &s;erves rather to give Light into the Nature of Money, than to teach a new Mea&s;ure of Traffick.</Q></P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the great Truth of this Ob&s;ervation, the People of <HI>New-England,</HI> about forty Years ago, projected a Sort of Money,
<PB N="4" REF="006292_0003_102853A26CE3C688">
con&s;i&s;ting of Publick Bills of Credit, and differing from the Money of all the re&s;t of the World. They argued ju&s;tly enough, that the&s;e Bills have &s;everal of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Properties of Money. They are du|rable; or, in Ca&s;e of Decay, others may ea&s;ily be provided to &s;upply their Place. They are of light and ea&s;y Carriage. They are as un|likely to be counterfeited as Silver or Gold: And they may be propor|tioned in Quantity to the Trade and Circum&s;tances of the People. But then their Value is confin'd to the Governments of <HI>New England,</HI> which Experience has &s;hewn them, cannot be pre&s;erved, whil&s;t they have Commerce with the re&s;t of the World.</P>
<P>It was in the Year 1690, that the Government of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> i&s;&s;ued the fir&s;t Publick Bills of Credit that were known in <HI>New-England</HI>: For upon the Return of the Forces from an unfortunate Ex|pedition again&s;t <HI>Canada,</HI> there was a Demand for a larger Sum of Money than it was po&s;&s;ible for the Government immediately to rai&s;e. The Court laid a Tax equal to the Demand, and i&s;&s;ued Bills of Credit, with which they paid the Publick Debt, and promis'd to receive tho&s;e Bills; and by a &s;ub&s;equent Vote or Re&s;olve, allow'd 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> on them in di&s;charge of the Tax.</P>
<P>The Thing was new, and many of the Soldiers who received the Bills were forc'd to part with them at a Di&s;count of 30 or 40 <HI>per Cent.</HI> to &s;upply their immediate Nece&s;&s;ities; but before the Tax was paid, the Bills were valued equal to Money, or rather above it. This Emi&s;&s;ion was drawn in and fini&s;h'd without any bad Influence upon the whole Currency.</P>
<P>In Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s War, the Government again i&s;&s;ued a Sum in Bills annually, which not being very con&s;iderable, and the Bills having a Pre|ference in the Trea&s;ury to Silver, kept up their Credit until about the Year 1711, when &s;uch large Sums were i&s;&s;ued, that Silver began to be hoarded by &s;ome, and exported by others, in large Quantities, and the Bills became the only Mea&s;ure and In&s;trument by which all private Trade and Dealing were regulated and managed. And to confirm the Currency of the Bills, and effectually to bani&s;h Silver and Gold, the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Province, in the Year 1712, made their Bills a Tender in Di&s;charge of all Debts, unle&s;s there appeared a &s;pecial Agreement or Contract other|wise.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus there being a &s;omewhat greater Scarcity of Silver than common, a general Opinion prevail'd, that the Currency of the Country might be enlarg'd by i&s;&s;uing Paper; but like the Dog in the Fable, while they catch'd at the Shadow, they let go the Sub|&s;tance.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006292_0004_102853A588A804C8">In the Year 1714, the Silver being gone, and the whole Sum in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> then extant being le&s;s than was nece&s;&s;ary to carry on the Trade, the Peo|ple were drove to great Straits, and a Project was &s;et on Foot for a Pri|vate Bank of Bills of Credit: To divert which, and &s;atisfy the Inhabi|tants, the Government i&s;&s;ued &pound; 50,000, being then equal to Silver at about 10&s; per Ounce, and lent to &s;uch Per&s;ons as &s;hould give Security <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> pay 1 5th part of the Principal annually, and an Intere&s;t of 5 <HI>per Cent</HI>: And as Bills of the &s;ame Form were i&s;&s;ued every Year by the Government; for their ordinary Charge, this Intere&s;t was apply'd as Part of the Fund for drawing in &s;uch Bills. The whole Scheme of this Loan &s;eems to have been taken from a chimerical Projection for a Land-Bank, printed in <HI>London</HI> in the Year 1684, and re-printed at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> about this Time. In 1716, a Loan of &pound; 100,000 was i&s;&s;ued: A few Years after, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of &pound; 50,000; and then one of &pound; 60,000; the Bills of each being of the &s;ame Tenor. None of the Loans were paid at the Periods promis'd, and the Borrowers were indulg'd one Year after another, and &s;everal of them are not yet clo&s;ed, though the Sum out&s;tanding is now incon&s;idera|ble. When a Tax has been engag'd as a Security to the Bills, by the Government, it never, but in one In&s;tance, has been po&s;tpon'd; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this Fund, as it is call'd, is very fallacious, and has no Tendency to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Bills at any certain Rate or Value. For In&s;tance, In 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Government i&s;&s;ued &pound; 10,000, which they promi&s;ed to draw in by the End of 1703; but in the Beginning of 1703, they i&s;&s;ued &pound; 10,000 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, exactly of the &s;ame Form, and which at all Times were received in the Trea&s;ury indifferently with the Fir&s;t, and engaged to bring in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in 1705, which in Effect is putting off the fir&s;t Sum 'till then, and they continued this Practice from Year to Year <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here was a fatal Error. Had the Government made a Tax every Year for &s;uch Sum as they i&s;&s;ued, given the Premium of 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> to &s;uch as paid Bills, di&s;tingui&s;h'd the Bills of each Year, and &s;uffer'd no other to an&s;wer the Tax of that Year, and allow'd tho&s;e Inhabitants that did not pay Bills to pay Silver, (of which there was then &s;ufficient) and &s;o fini&s;h'd one Sett of Bills every Year, mo&s;t of the Mi&s;chiefs that attend a Paper Currency would have been prevented. Indeed it's probable, &s;uch Bills would have been hoarded, and never &s;erv'd as a Medium, but the Government would have obtain'd a Year's Credit, which was the Thing fir&s;t aim'd at.</NOTE>. In the Year 1736, the Bills were &s;o depreciated, that 26 of 27&s; was equal to no more than one Ounce of Silver. All the Bills that were then extant were to be drawn in by the Year 1741. A new Sort of Bills were then i&s;&s;ued for the Government
<PB N="6" REF="006292_0005_102853AB48F620E0">
Charges, one of which was to be equal to three of the Old, in publick and private Payments, and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or was promis'd an Ounce of Silver for every 6&s;8 of the New; and the &s;ame Promi&s;e &s;eems imply'd for every 20&s; of the Old, to be paid in the Year 1742. And it was propos'd the Silver &s;hould be rais'd in this Manner: Whenever Bills of the new Form were i&s;&s;ued, a Tax was actually laid equal to the Sum i&s;&s;ued, on &s;ome Year before 1742, and without any further Act of the Court, mu&s;t have been levy'd in &s;uch Year. This Tax was payable in Bills, or in Silver at 6&s;8 the Ounce: If it was all paid in Bills, there could be no Demand on the Trea&s;ury: If any were left out, &s;omebody mu&s;t have paid in Silver &s;ufficient to exchange them. Thus there &s;eem'd to be full Provi&s;ion for enabling the Government to keep their Promi&s;e. But here was the Leak. By the Acts of Government i&s;&s;uing the Bills of the old Form, it was engaged, that the whole of them &s;hould be drawn in before the Year 1742, a certain Sum each Year; but it was left to the A&s;&s;emblies of each Year to apportion this Tax upon the Towns: So that a further Act of the whole Legi&s;lature was found ne|ce&s;&s;ary. When the Year 1741 came, the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives were &s;en&s;ible that an extreme Difficulty would be brought upon the People, by fini&s;hing the whole Bills in this Manner, when there was no Silver and Gold in the Country, to &s;erve as a Currency, in the room of them; and when the late Governour, Mr. <HI>Belcher,</HI> in&s;i&s;ted upon their apportioning the Tax of that Year, they refus'd to do it, on failure of which, the whole Scheme for paying off the new Bills mu&s;t be de|feated. And indeed there was &s;o little Expectation of the Bills being paid off in 1742, at 6&s;8, that in 1741, 9&s; of them would not pur|cha&s;e an Ounce of Silver. In the &s;ame Year the pre&s;ent Governour came to the Chair, and found the Currency of the Country thus per|plexed; and the fir&s;t A&s;&s;embly he met, refus'd to apportion the Tax, after he had recommended it to them. This Refu&s;al as effectually de&s;troy'd the Security of the Bills, as any Act of Government could have done, and the be&s;t Terms the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives could be brought to were, to carry the Tax of 1741, part of it to the Year 1742, and the remainder to 1743; and they provided by a Clau&s;e in the Act, that if the A&s;&s;emblies of tho&s;e Years &s;hould not agree upon ap|portioning the Tax, the Trea&s;urer &s;hould i&s;&s;ue his Warrants agreable to the Apportionment in the la&s;t Tax Act. At the &s;ame Time Bills for the future Charges of Government were i&s;&s;ued, of a new Form, payable in Silver at 6&s;8 the Ounce in 1746; one of the&s;e Bills to be equal to four of the fir&s;t Form (Silver being now about 28&s; per Ounce in the old Bills,) and full Provi&s;ion was al&s;o made for bringing in the&s;e new Bills in one or other of the Years before 1746, or Silver in lieu of them: So that now it was not in the Power of any Thing &s;hort of the
<PB N="7" REF="006292_0006_10282DC7A91384A8">
three Branches of the Legi&s;lature, to prevent all the Paper Currency extant being bro't in by the Year 1746. And to &s;atisfy the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the Bills engag'd to be redeem'd in 1742, they were made equal to the new Bills in publick and private Payments, and a Tax was granted for &s;uch Sum as the former Taxes were rendred deficient by Means of rai&s;ing the Value of the&s;e Bills. This gave every Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of tho&s;e Bills, when were commonly called the Middle Tenor Bills, a great deal more than the Bill co&s;t him, tho' the Government neither did nor could comply with their Promi&s;e in Form. Before the Governour con&s;ented to the afore-mentioned Act, he in&s;i&s;ted, in a Speech made to the Court, upon their coming into &s;ome Mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring the Value of private Debts, in Ca&s;e the Bills &s;hould depreciate; upon which another Act was agreed on and pa&s;s'd, the De&s;ign of which was, That although Bills were the only In&s;trument in all Trade and Dealing, yet that Silver at 6&s;8 the Ounce &s;hould be the Mea&s;ure. And the Bills then and after to be emitted for five Years, were declared equal to Silver at that Rate: And in Ca&s;e the Bills &s;hould depreciate, compared with Silver and Exchange to <HI>London,</HI> an Addition &s;hould be made on all Debts and Contracts equal to the Depreciation; and the current Rate of Silver and Exchange, was to be determined every &s;ix Months, either by the General Court, or by &s;even Councellors, or by a Committee appointed by the Judges of the Superior Court. This has been commonly called, the Equity Act; and it was generally thought, would prevent the great Mi&s;chiefs of a Paper Currency, but yet it has prov'd of little or no Service. For</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t Part of the Act, People were &s;oon convinced that to make one Thing the &s;ole Mea&s;ure, and another the &s;ole In&s;trument of Trade, was impo&s;&s;ible. And all Per&s;ons continued to keep their Books, and make their Agreements for Bills, as much as if the Act never pa&s;s'd. And the Allowance for Depreciation run us into great Confu&s;ion: The Merchant &s;eldom or ever demanded it, for it would have been almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible in a running Account to have &s;ettled it; and be&s;ides, he would have mi&s;s'd the Sale of his Goods by in&s;i&s;ting on it, and the Practice of it in any one Ca&s;e, and not generally, prov'd very unequal. Indeed it &s;oon appear'd, that the &s;trict Ob&s;ervance of the Rule would produce great Inju&s;tice. Silver and Exchange might ri&s;e 10 or 20 <HI>per Cent.</HI> but it was &s;everal Months before this had a general Influence on Trade even in the Town of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and longer in other Parts of the Province, and &s;ome Years before it had it's Effect on the Landed E&s;tate of the Pro|vince. It was then thought, if Provi&s;ions were taken in with Silver as the Standard, it might be a good Addition to the former Law, and an Act pa&s;s'd accordingly, but the Price of Provi&s;ions being govern'd by the Plenty or Scarcity of them, and a &s;carce Year following immediately upon this
<PB N="8" REF="006292_0007_102853B188181908">
Alteration of the Rule, made the Ob&s;ervance of it more difficult than before.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking out of the French and Indian War, all Hopes of put|ting a Period to the Paper Currency vani&s;h'd; for the Defence of the four Governments of <HI>New-England,</HI> lays in a manner, tho' very unrea&s;onably, upon the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Province, and &s;uch large Sums were nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the War, e&s;pecially for the Charge of the &s;ucce&s;sful Expe|dition again&s;t <HI>Cap Breton,</HI> that the Taxes for drawing in the Bills i&s;&s;ued for tho&s;e Charges were greater than it was po&s;&s;ible for the People to pay before 1746; and &s;o the Funds for the future Emi&s;&s;ions were nece&s;&s;arily laid upon more di&s;tant Years. The Bills being thus multi|ply'd &s;unk in their Value fa&s;ter than u&s;ual; &s;o that 56 or 58&s; now will purcha&s;e no more Silver than 30&s; would do five or &s;ix Years ago.</P>
<P>I have omitted a great many Circum&s;tances relating to the&s;e Bills, de|&s;igning only to give a general Idea of the Nature and Operation of them.</P>
<P>The other Governments of <HI>New-England</HI> &s;oon went into the &s;ame Practice of i&s;&s;uing Bills, after the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> had &s;hewn them the Way; and the Bills of each Government, by common Con&s;ent, obtain'd a Currency through the Whole.</P>
<P>The great Mi&s;chiefs and infinite Inju&s;tice ari&s;ing from a depreciating Currency, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to prevent or redre&s;s, are &s;o glaring, and our Ears have been &s;o fill'd with the Complaints and Cries of tho&s;e who have been mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected, that there is no need of &s;pending any Time in de&s;cribing or enumerating them.</P>
<P>During the Currency of the&s;e Bills, a Variety of Propo&s;als have been publi&s;hed for retrieving their Credit, and for furni&s;hing a &s;table Paper Currency, but all to no Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>No Sort of Bills but &s;uch as are payable on Demand, can have an i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">able Value; and in this Ca&s;e there mu&s;t be a Depo&s;it, and it is as ea&s;y to provide Silver to &s;erve for a Medium, as for a Deposit, and it is as likely to &s;tay in the Country in one Ca&s;e as in the other.</P>
<P>Bills that are payable at a di&s;tant Day, will be e&s;teem'd according to the Time of Payment, and from their being i&s;&s;ued, will gradually ri&s;e in their Value, which will produce the &s;ame Inju&s;tice as a gradual Depre|ciation; for whether the Creditor receives le&s;s or the Debtor pays more than the Contract, the Injury is the &s;ame; &s;omebody is defrauded: But then, the Ri&s;e would be more intolerable than the Fall. The Cre|ditors are few in Number compar'd with the Debtors, the one generally envy'd, the other pity'd. The Injury and Complaint of the Creditors have been too much di&s;regarded; but turn the Tables, and oppre&s;s the numerous Debtors, and they will not long remain quiet.</P>
<P>I think therefore we may re&s;t &s;atisfy'd, no &s;table Currency can be pro|jected, other than that of Silver and Gold.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="006292_0008_102853B33656EF38">And here I expect to be a&s;k'd: Why may not <HI>New-England</HI> have a Currency of Bills of Credit, as well as <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Penn&s;ilvania</HI>? I an&s;wer. At <HI>New York,</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia</HI> Silver is their Medium, and mill'd Dollars pa&s;s current at a known determinate Rate, and other foreign Coins in proportion: Paper Bills are &s;ometimes the In&s;trument in Payments, but the Proportion is &s;mall compar'd with the Silver; and I have no Doubt that if either of tho&s;e Governments &s;hould ever i&s;&s;ue a &s;ufficient Sum in Bills to &s;erve for a Currency, their Silver and Gold would leave them, and their Bills depreciate as tho&s;e of <HI>New-England</HI> have done; which, as has been ob&s;erved, kept their Value while Silver continued current with them.</P>
<P>The General Court of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> &s;eem at length fully convinc'd of the Nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;troying the Paper Currency; and ha|ving a Sum granted by Parliament to reimbur&s;e the Expence of the <HI>Cap-Breton</HI> Expedition, they have pa&s;s'd an Act of A&s;&s;embly for tran&s;porting the &s;ame in foreign Coin, and exchanging it for their Bills by the la&s;t of <HI>March</HI> 1750, at the Rate of a mill'd Dollar for 45&s; Currency; and have determin'd, that after that Time, all Contracts &s;hall be in Silver at the Rate of 6&s; a Dollar, which is agreable to the Rate e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Act of Parliament, and that all pa&s;t Contracts &s;hall be di&s;charg'd by a Dollar for 45&s;, and they have prohibited the Currency of the Bills of the other Governments after the Redemption of their own Bills.</P>
<P>But this Act, notwith&s;tanding all the Calamities brought upon the Province by Paper Money, is not univer&s;ally approv'd of.</P>
<P>One would think, that with a People making a high Profe&s;&s;ion of Re|ligion, there &s;hould need no other Argument to reconcile them to the Act than this, <HI>viz.</HI> That Truth and Ju&s;tice, after having been bani&s;h'd near forty Years, are in a fair Way to return again. Remove the Ca&s;e and the Effect will cea&s;e. In this Ca&s;e no imaginary or expected Difi|culties that may attend the Trade of the Province, ought to have any Weight.</P>
<P>However, we will con&s;ider the &s;everal Exceptions that are made to the Act, and &s;ee what Force they have.</P>
<P>The principal Objection with a greater Number than publickly care to own it, is this; That whenever the Bills are redeemed, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or ought to be paid as much as they would purcha&s;e in Silver at the Time they were i&s;&s;ued, which might be a Recompence for what he has &s;uffered by the Depre|ciation. Here &s;eems to be an unwarrantable De&s;ire of per&s;onal Advantage at the Expence of the Publick. There has been &s;uch a Confounding of Pro|perty that it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to remedy what is pa&s;t. All Attempts have rather increas'd the Evil. Be&s;ides, how unrea&s;onable would it be, when the Cour&s;e of Exchange for a Year or two pa&s;t has been at 900 <HI>per Cent.</HI> advance from Sterling, and almo&s;t Nineteen in Twenty of the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors, have receiv'd the Bills at that depreciated Rate, they &s;hould now be paid
<PB N="10" REF="006292_0009_102853B62118F238">
double, or more, what they gave for them. But we are told, the Bills promi&s;e a certain Sum, and it behoves the Government to pay off their Bills according to their Promi&s;e, as much as it does a private Per&s;on.</P>
<P>Promi&s;es made by private Per&s;ons, the Performance whereof will pro|duce great and exten&s;ive Inju&s;tice, may and ought to be di&s;pen&s;ed with. I acknowledge, it behoved the Government, by all Ways and Means po&s;&s;ible, after they had i&s;&s;ued their Bills, to &s;upport the Credit of them, and great Inju&s;tice ari&s;es by their Failure; but now it is produc'd, as the Ca&s;e with the&s;e Bills is circum&s;tanced, there is no Remedy. The Bills have been &s;inking in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors Hands ever &s;ince they were i&s;&s;ued, and every one who had been a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or ought to have his Part of the Lo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> made up to him, and not the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the pre&s;ent Day run away with the Whole. But at fir&s;t Glance it appears impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ettle what every Man's Proportion &s;hall be. Be&s;ides, it may be con&s;idered in this Light. Whatever Sum is out&s;tanding in Bills, ju&s;t &s;o much is due from the Inhabitants to the Government; and whatever the Bills &s;ink in their Value, ju&s;t &s;o much le&s;s, really, the Inhabitants have to pay, than they would have, if the Bills kept their Value; and if they &s;unk in every Man's Hands in Proportion to his Part of the Tax, he could com|plain of no Inju&s;tice, which all ari&s;es from Per&s;ons being unequally po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;'d, tho' in what Proportion can never be a&s;certain'd. Let us &s;up|po&s;e then the Value of the Bills could be rais'd again, this would advance the Value of the Debt to the Government, and as great Inequality and Inju&s;tice will be occa&s;ioned by their ri&s;ing as was by their falling; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they are continually pa&s;&s;ing from one to another, the &s;ame Per&s;ons will not be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of them, in the &s;ame Proportion, when they ri&s;e, as when they fell.&mdash;It is &s;aid, the Parliament, in King WILLIAM's Reign, when the clipp'd Money was call'd in, receiv'd it as if it had been of full Weight, and voted a large Sum for the Deficiency occa&s;ioned thereby. It is very true: But it was owing to the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Times, which requir'd an immediate Stop to be put to the Currency of the clipp'd Money, which could be effected in no other Way: And it has always been allow'd, that Two Millions was given to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of that &s;ort of Money, more than in Equity they could claim.</P>
<P>Another Exception to the Act is, That it is in vain to think of a Silver Currency, while the Balance of Trade is again&s;t us; for the Silver will be immediately &s;hip'd off, and the Bills being de&s;troy'd, we &s;hall be without a Medium. By the Balance being again&s;t us, is, no Doubt, in|tended, that we import more than we are able, by our Exports of every Kind, to pay for. Indeed there is no making &s;o certain a Judgment of the Truth of this from Time to Time, with a Paper Currency, as with a Silver; which ordinarily would be more plenty or &s;carce, according as the Balance was for or again&s;t us. But I think it plainly appears, there is the bad Influence of the Paper Currency upon our Trade, <HI>viz.</HI> That
<PB N="11" REF="006292_0010_102853B7AD917760">
<HI>now</HI> the Profit ari&s;ing to the Merchant, upon mo&s;t Branches of our Trade, is from the Goods imported; whereas, <HI>when Silver was current,</HI> all Commodities for Exportation to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> the Southern Colo|nies on the Continent, and the foreign Ports in <HI>Europe,</HI> were purchas'd at &s;uch Rates here, that they would bear an Advance when they came to Market; and the Profit of the Adventure lay in that Advance, more than in the Goods imported in Return, and <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Goods were frequently &s;o low here, that they made an advantageous Return to <HI>Eng|land.</HI> Nay, even in our Trade to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> although the Profit of that con&s;i&s;ted principally in the Advance on the Goods imported hither, yet a Man but of a middling Judgment in Trade, could ordinarily find a better Way of making Returns than &s;hipping Silver from hence: Now it is mo&s;t natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that when we change our Currency, altho' a great Proportion of the Silver may at fir&s;t be exported, to &s;atisfy the Debts due to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and perhaps to import more <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods; and we may be greatly &s;traitned from the Scantine&s;s of the Cur|rency, yet in a &s;hort Time it will re&s;tore the Trade to the State it was in before the Paper Currency commenc'd; for a Man of but &s;mall Acquaintance with Trade, before he parts with his Silver will con&s;ider, whether the Price demanded for any Commodity for Exportation, is &s;o rea&s;onable as that he has as good a Chance of Advantage by &s;hipping the Commodity as the Silver, the Con&s;equence of which will be, not that he mu&s;t &s;hip his Silver becau&s;e he can't have the Commodity at a rea&s;onable Price, but it will come down to &s;uch a Rate as that he can better afford to &s;hip it than the Silver; and there is no Room to &s;uppo&s;e the contrary, unle&s;s we could imagine that all the Produce of the Country, of every kind, is not &s;ufficient to pay what is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for our Con|&s;umption; which Suppo&s;ition is without the lea&s;t Foundation. If we have &s;pent more than we have earnt while our Paper Currency la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed (for there is no Country under Heaven where People who have no E&s;tates live &s;o luxuriou&s;ly as they do here) it will be one good Effect of the new Currency, that it will make us better Hu&s;bands. But then I may perhaps be told, if the Con&s;equence of this new Currency will be the Lowering the Commodities of the Country, &s;o far it will be a Da|mage. Not at all: For tho&s;e Things imported, and which are nece&s;|&s;ary in the Bu&s;ine&s;s and Expences of the Inhabitants, will be cheap in Proportion. If a Trader has a rea&s;onable Profit or Advance on the Thing exported, he will have none on what he returns in lieu of it. No Doubt, in the general Scramble that we have had for Twenty Years pa&s;t, when the Conte&s;t has been, who &s;hould rai&s;e the Price of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Bu&s;ine&s;s and Wares fa&s;te&s;t, &s;ome have done it in greater Propo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> than others, and it may be expected they will fall accordingly; and after

a little while all Things will return to the Standard, and bear a ju&s;t Pro|portion one to another.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Per&s;ons, I acknowledge, who have made a di&s;hone&s;t Gain by a depreciating Currency, mu&s;t be content, if they can re&s;t &s;o, with what is pa&s;t, and live hone&s;tly for the future. Of this Sort, in the Country, have been tho&s;e who have made a Trade of buying Lands at long Cre|dit, and then paying for them in Bills when they have depreciated &s;o much that perhaps the Value of their Lands has doubled. And, in the Town, may be reckon'd, &s;uch Traders and Shopkeepers as have bought large Quantities of Goods on long Credit, and after that greatly exceeded the Credit given, and before Payment has been made the Va|lue of the Bills have &s;unk one Half, and their Goods advanc'd in their Shops in Proportion. Now the Di&s;couragement of this Trade, in&s;tead of being any Di&s;advantage to us, will be extremely for our Benefit; for this unju&s;t Gain had encouraged great Numbers, with little or no Trading Stock, to leave the Bu&s;ine&s;s they were bred to, and turn Shopkeepers; which has proved of pernicious Con&s;equence, by le&s;&s;ening the Number of Artificers and labouring People, and by infecting tho&s;e that remain with an Itch after living by their Heads rather than their Hands. I would not be under&s;tood, that all Shopkeepers, e&s;pecially &s;uch as have been bred to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, or have a Stock to begin with, &s;hould be di&s;coun|tenanced. A Number will always be nece&s;&s;ary for the convenient Sup|ply of Goods to the Inhabitants in &s;mall Parcels; but they have of late increas'd to a &s;urprizing Degree, and it looks as if almo&s;t all liv'd one upon another, and that but a &s;mall Proportion was employ'd in pro|ducing any Thing from the Earth or Sea.</P>
<P>There has been a further Exception made, which is not again&s;t the De&s;ign of the Act, but the Sufficiency of it to an&s;wer the Purpo&s;es pro|pos'd. It is &s;aid, That notwith&s;tanding all the Provi&s;ion that is made to the contrary, the Bills of the other Governments will remain current in this Province, and if &s;o, the Act can have no good Effect, as to any future Regulation of the Currency.</P>
<P>It is, I confe&s;s, a great Unhappine&s;s, that we are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;o large a Sum in the other Governments Bills, and there is great Danger, That, unle&s;s the Parliament interpo&s;e, the Bills will either die in our Hands, or the Continuance of their Currency will prevent the De&s;ign of the Act. Of the two Evils the fir&s;t is the lea&s;t; for though it will be a heavy Lo&s;s, we feel it at once, and it's over; the other would be a con|tinued Lo&s;s, and work our Ruin. But there is all imaginable Rea&s;on to expect the Interpo&s;ition of the Parliament. The Affair of the <HI>New-England</HI> Currencies has formerly been under the Con&s;ideration of the Hou&s;e of Commons. The <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Province have now voluntarily gone into the &s;ame Mea&s;ures, or perhaps more effectual than any for|merly

propos'd in Parliament, that they &s;hould be compell'd to. They have twice invited the other Governments to join Commi&s;&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> concerting Mea&s;ures that might &s;uit the Whole, before they &s;ettled any for them&s;elves, but they all neglected or refu&s;ed; though it's now ge|nerally &s;uppos'd that <HI>Connecticut</HI> will regulate their Currency in much the &s;ame Manner the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> have done.&mdash; Can it then be ima|gin'd that the other Governments will be &s;uffer'd, either greatly to in|jure the People of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> by the Lo&s;s of the Bills they are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, or el&s;e by the Currency of them, defeat the Regulation of the Whole? And it will be much ea&s;ier now to project a Method for &s;inking the&s;e Bills without Lo&s;s, than it would have been if the <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts</HI> Act had never pa&s;s'd. In order to &s;hew how it may be effected, we will fir&s;t con&s;ider the State of the Bills of each Government, and then offer &s;ome Propo&s;als for putting an End to their Currency, in a Manner the lea&s;t burthen&s;ome that may be.</P>
<P><HI>Connecticut</HI> are a wi&s;e People, and have conducted their publick Affairs with great Prudence, more e&s;pecially with Re&s;pect to their Bills of Cre|dit. They have never run into any extravagant Emi&s;&s;ions; they have &s;hewn a De&s;ire to pre&s;erve the Credit of tho&s;e Bills they have i&s;&s;ued, though without Succe&s;s; and, if I am not mi&s;informed, they have very little more out&s;tanding than their Grant from the Parliament, at the Rate &s;et by the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> will redeem: If, therefore, they &s;hould refu&s;e to apply the Grant to this Purpo&s;e them&s;elves (which there is no great Danger of) the Way is very plain for the Parliament to do it for them.</P>
<P><HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> have about Four Hundred and Fifty Thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd Pounds of the pre&s;ent Currency, or, as it is commonly called, old Tenor. Their Grant will not &s;ink above One Hundred and Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds, which will leave Three Hundred Thou&s;and. About One Third was lent to the Inhabitants, in like Manner as the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Loans, only for a longer Term, and the E&s;tates of the Borrowers are mortgaged to the Government for Security. The Remainder, except a &s;mall Proportion for the Charge of their Government, was i&s;&s;ued for the <HI>Canada</HI> Expedition, and has no other Fund for drawing it in again, be&s;ides an Expectation of being repaid the Charge of that Expedition by his Maje&s;ty. But after they &s;hall have receiv'd what may be allow'd for tho&s;e Charges, it's probable they may have about One Hundred and Eighty Thou&s;and Pounds remaining out&s;tanding.</P>
<P><HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> about three Months ago, had between Five and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds, the like Currency. They have lately &s;unk Seventy Five Thou&s;and Pounds by Bills of Exchange drawn on their Agent on Account of the <HI>Canada</HI> Expedition.

<P>It is a Que&s;tion whether <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> have one eighth Part of their Bills current within that Government. <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> has more of theirs, perhaps one third or one half. The re&s;t of the Bills of both Govern|ments are current in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut.</HI> There is there|fore no Rea&s;on to expect that <HI>New Hamp&s;hire</HI> or <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> will be anxious about redeeming their Bills. It is their Intere&s;t to have them depreciate until they become of no Value: The Borrowers will &s;o much the ea&s;ier di&s;charge their Debts to the Government, and the Inhabitants pay what is due by Taxes. Nay there is great Rea&s;on to fear that <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> may &s;peedily i&s;&s;ue more Bills. The Governor and all the Members of the Legi&s;lature are elected by the People, and it is &s;ometimes made a Te&s;t to the Candidates before their Election, that they &s;hall declare in Favour of more Paper Money, and this is as likely to be the Ca&s;e at their Election in <HI>May</HI> next, as it has been in Times pa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> are able to &s;ink all their Bills above the Grant, by a Tax, in one Year. <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> have a Sum &s;o much greater in Proportion, that it will be extremely difficult, and perhaps impo&s;&s;ible, for them to do it.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then that by an Act of Parliament, all the E&s;tates mortgag'd, or other Securities given to the Governments of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> for paying in the Bills according to the nominal Value, &s;hould be made liable for the Payment of a Spani&s;h Dollar, or other Silver Coin in Proportion, for every <HI>Forty five Shillings</HI> in Bills of the old Tenor, or every <HI>Eleven Shillings &amp; Three Pence</HI> in Bills of the new Tenor. That tho&s;e Borrowers who have engag'd to pay the Whole in le&s;s than Ten Years, &s;hould be left to comply with their re&s;pective Agreements as to the Time of Payment; but where any exceeded Ten Years, they &s;hould be held to pay one Tenth annually, their former Agreements notwith&s;tan|ding; and that Intere&s;t of 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> &s;hould be paid from Time to Time, for all that remain'd unpaid. If any Borrower fail'd of making Payment three Months after it became due, &s;o much of the mortgag'd E&s;tate, as would make up the Deficiency, to be forthwith &s;old, without a Proce&s;s at Law. And for the Bills that have been i&s;&s;ued for the Char|ges of Government, the A&s;&s;embly of each Government to make a Tax for one Tenth part annually, with the Addition of 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t in the whole Sum that in each Year remain out&s;tanding; &s;uch Tax to be paid likewi&s;e in Silver at the Rates afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>When this is done, each Government &s;hould be oblig'd to call in all their pre&s;ent Currency, and give the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors new Bills (none to be le&s;s than Five Pounds Proclamation Money) payable in Silver with Intere&s;t of 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> the Whole in Ten Years, and one Tenth to be di&s;charg'd

<P>The Members of the Legi&s;latures might be compell'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their Parts, either by being made liable to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the Bills, in Ca&s;e of Neglect; or by &s;uch other Penalties or Di&s;qualifications as the Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> of Parliament &s;hould direct.</P>
<P>In this Way Nobody could complain of Inju&s;tice or Oppre&s;&s;ion. F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></P>
<P>The <HI>Governments</HI> would have but a very &s;mall Burthen. One Thou|&s;and Pounds Sterling a Year, or thereabouts, would be &s;ufficient for <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI>'s Tax, and <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> would not rai&s;e &s;o much. And</P>
<P>The <HI>Borrowers</HI> will not pay &s;o much as they received; many in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> not half &s;o much; and the Whole of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Loan was i&s;&s;ued when Silver was about 30&s; per Ounce, and they will pay it at above 50&s;.&mdash;If it be urg'd, That when they made their Contract, they expected to di&s;charge it by Bills of a depreciated Value, and not by Sil|ver. This was an unju&s;t Contract, and therefore ought to be void, or in Force &s;o far only as it is equitable. And</P>
<P>The <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the Bills</HI> will have the pre&s;ent Value of them; for the Intere&s;t they will carry will make them as good as if they were payable on Demand.</P>
<P>Thus, as briefly as I could, I have given an Account of the Nature, Ri&s;e, and Progre&s;s of the Paper Currency of <HI>New England,</HI> and of the Mea&s;ures taken by the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> to &s;ink the Bills of that Province <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and have propos'd a Method, in which the other Governments may ea&s;ily &s;ink theirs: And I heartily wi&s;h they may be compell'd to it, that &s;o Fraud, Inju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion, which for thirty Years pa&s;t have reign'd triumphant among us, may be bani&s;h'd for ever.</P>
