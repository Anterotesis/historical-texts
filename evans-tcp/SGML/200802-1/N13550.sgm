<BIBL>PSALM XLVII. 8, 9.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;GOD &s;itteth upon the throne of his holine&s;s: The Princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the GOD of <HI>Abraham;</HI> for the Shields of the earth belong unto GOD: He is greatly exalted,</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AT what time, or upon what occa&s;ion, the P&s;alm before us was compo&s;ed, is neither certain, nor ea&s;y, at this di&s;tance of time, to determine.&mdash;"Many have &s;uppo&s;ed it to have been pen|ned, on occa&s;ion of bringing up the <HI>Ark</HI> to <HI>Mount Zion.</HI>"&mdash;Others, "that it looks further, and is prophetick of the a&s;cen&s;ion of the <HI>glo|rious Mediator,</HI> after he had fini&s;hed his work on earth, and the &s;etting up his kingdom in the world."</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="017114_0005_0FA02F5C6AC36B10">
FROM the &s;entiments it contains, it might al&s;o be con&s;idered as a P&s;alm compo&s;ed, and well adapted, for the congregation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when all the tribes came to <HI>Hebron</HI> to receive <HI>David,</HI> and by their <HI>elders</HI> to <HI>make a league with him,</HI> as their <HI>chief magi&s;trate;</HI> and to e&s;tabli&s;h him in the government.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vid. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 5. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT, which, or whether either of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions hath any &s;olid foundation, mu&s;t be left to the learned and judicious to deter|mine.&mdash;Be the primary occa&s;ion, of this <HI>devout compo&s;ition,</HI> what it may; it is beyond di&s;pute, that the &s;ubjects of it are intere&s;ting and important:&mdash;Subjects well &s;uited to in|&s;pire the church and people of GOD, at all times, with a &s;en&s;e of his government and their dependence, and of their indi&s;pen&s;ible obligations to celebrate the glories of his perfections, herein di&s;played, as the ground of their confidence and theme of their prai&s;e.</P>
<P>IN a word, it is an exhortation to <HI>the peo|ple of GOD,</HI> to prai&s;e the LORD, as "<HI>The Great King over all the earth,</HI>" who &s;hould <HI>&s;ubdue the people,</HI> their enemies and oppre&s;&s;ors <HI>under them, and the nations under their feet:</HI> And as that GOD, who &s;hould <HI>choo&s;e their inheritance for them,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;h them in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of it.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="017114_0006_0FA02F5D9AF7C730">
AGREEABLY, in confirmation of this their confidence, it is &s;aid, in the text&mdash;That <HI>GOD &s;itteth upon the throne of his holine&s;s: The Princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the GOD of</HI> Abraham; <HI>for the Shields of the earth belong unto GOD: He is greatly exalted.</HI></P>
<P>IN the&s;e words, we have a &s;triking repre|&s;entation,&mdash;a lively portrait of the happy &s;tate of a people, or nation, in covenant with GOD, and favoured with his protection and &s;miles; of a people e&s;tabli&s;hed in the enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;ings of a <HI>civil government,</HI> who&s;e con&s;titution is founded in principles of liberty and equity, who&s;e laws are admini&s;tred with ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and who&s;e end is the glory of GOD, in the good of mankind. <HI>The Great GOD,</HI> as the &s;overeign, the &s;u|preme ruler, <HI>&s;itting on the throne of his holi|ne&s;s,</HI> with all the powers of government, originally and ultimately, ve&s;ted in him&s;elf, and exerci&s;ed by him, agreeable to the eternal laws of righteou&s;ne&s;s and equity.&mdash;<HI>The Prin|ces of the people,</HI> their leaders, or deligates, <HI>are gathered together,</HI> from all parts of the land, in the name of their con&s;tituents, and under the direction and influence of their &s;upreme ruler and &s;overeign, to con&s;ult the public weal, to enact laws and to tran&s;act the great affairs of the nation and of government. The people, the body of the nation, are there introduced, as <HI>The people of the GOD of
<PB N="4" REF="017114_0007_0FA02F5DEDA103D8">
Abraham,</HI> in covenant with him, and devout|ly acknowledging their fealty to him, as their &s;overeign, and their dependence upon him and his ble&s;&s;ing, both for coun&s;el and de|fence. And in fine, that nothing might be wanting to compleat the view, we have <HI>The Shields of the earth,</HI> repre&s;enting both the powers of government and the per&s;ons ve&s;ted with them, exhibited, as <HI>belonging to GOD,</HI> religiou&s;ly devoted to his &s;ervice and glory, or under his direction and controul, to carry to effect the purpo&s;es of his benevolence and wi&s;dom for the good of his people, or the de&s;igns of his ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s in the government of the world.&mdash;The whole is intended to &s;how&mdash;'That magi&s;tracy, or civil government, is of divine in&s;titution&mdash;'That the end of it is the good of the governed&mdash;and 'That, as all power and all authority are derived from him, the glory of all &s;hould redound to his name; to the end, that <HI>GOD,</HI> who <HI>&s;itteth on the throne might be greatly exalted.</HI></P>
<P>THAT GOD, who created and pre&s;erves, of right, doth govern the world, is a truth, which the light of nature teaches, which revelation confirms, and a truth, which the common &s;en&s;e of mankind in all ages, concurs to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>THAT the power, authority and &s;overeign|ty of GOD are ab&s;olute and uncontroulable is a truth ju&s;tly deducible from the preceed|ing, and equally indi&s;putable.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="017114_0008_0FA02F5F230DDC98">
THE &s;acred &s;criptures are far from being &s;ilent, or doubtful, upon a &s;ubject &s;o funda|mental, &s;o important. We frequently find all the powers of moral government, in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, &s;olemnly a&s;&s;umed by GOD, or devoutly a&s;cribed unto him, in the divine oracles. Hence GOD is introduced by the holy prophet, as &s;aying, "I am the LORD, and there is none el&s;e; there is no GOD be&s;ides me. I form the light and create darkne&s;s: I make peace and create evil: I the LORD do all the&s;e things."<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 45 5. 7.</NOTE> "I will work, and who &s;hall let it?"<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 43, 13</NOTE>&mdash;And to &s;how the vanity of oppugnation to his government or authority, it is added,&mdash;"Let the pot&s;herd &s;trive with the pot&s;herds of the earth: But wo to him that &s;triveth with his maker."<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 45 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND what GOD hath thus ju&s;tly a&s;&s;umed, is devoutly a&s;cribed to him by his &s;aints and people; and frequently mentioned as the ground of their confidence, as well as the rea&s;on of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;At all times, yea, even in times of perplexity and darkne&s;s, it was the language of GOD's people&mdash;"The LORD reigneth, let the earth rejoice"<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 97. 1.</NOTE>&mdash;"The LORD is our judge, the LORD is our law|giver, the LORD is our king; He will &s;ave us."<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai.</NOTE> Holy <HI>David</HI> ob&s;erves, that "the king|dom is the LORD's, and he is governor among the nations."<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 22. 28.</NOTE> and to add no more, it is
<PB N="6" REF="017114_0009_0FA02F5F685B7B60">
&s;aid&mdash;That "The LORD &s;itteth King for|ever:"<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 29, 10.</NOTE> And, that "His Kingdom ruleth over all."<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">103, 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN this light con&s;idered, the Deity is to be acknowledged, as that GOD, who&s;e power and authority are &s;upreme, univer&s;al and un|controulable.</P>
<P>IT is not, however, authority or power alone, that forms the character, or gives an idea of the great moral governor of the uni|ver&s;e; but this power, and this authority, as tempered with wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, ju&s;tice, truth, faithfulne&s;s, and other moral perfecti|ons nece&s;&s;ary to a government founded in equity, exerci&s;ed in righteou&s;ne&s;s, glorious to him&s;elf and a ble&s;&s;ing to his creatures.</P>
<P>IT would have been ea&s;y to an infinite being, to have carried to effect the purpo&s;es of his government, by the influences of his &s;pirit, or the word of his power; but, for wi&s;e rea&s;ons, the &s;upreme Ruler <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ath been plea&s;ed to employ angels and men, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> mini|&s;ters in his kingdom; and to render even &s;econd cau&s;es &s;ub&s;ervient to the great de&s;igns of his wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s, in the government of the world.</P>
<P>FOR the glory of GOD, and the pre&s;erva|tion of order and communication of happine&s;s,
<PB N="7" REF="017114_0010_0FA02F631CC3EFF8">
It is both natural and rational to &s;uppo&s;e, that government &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among intelligent beings, of whatever rank, or degree in creation.</P>
<P>THIS conjecture is the more probable, with regard to the heavenly ho&s;ts, and tho&s;e bright intelligencies, who inhabit the cele&s;tial abodes, and are favoured with the neare&s;t approaches unto GOD, from the account the &s;acred ora|cles have given; of the various names, orders and degrees &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among them; as <HI>Angels, Arch-angels, Thrones, Dominions, Principali|ties</HI> and <HI>Powers.</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Col. 1. 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>SOMETHING of this kind, al&s;o, would, undoubtedly, have been advantageous, if not nece&s;&s;ary, to have perfected the felicity of mankind, had they continued in a &s;tate of innocence and rectitude: And for the order, harmony and happine&s;s of &s;ociety and the world, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that rule and government would have taken place among men, however virtuous, benevolent, or ju&s;t.</P>
<P>THE &s;till greater importance of &s;uch an in&s;titution to the peace, liberty, &s;afety and happine&s;s of individuals, of &s;ociety and the world of mankind, &s;ince &s;in, lu&s;t, pa&s;&s;ion, imperfection and every evil work have been introduced, needs neither time to con&s;ider, nor arguments to prove.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017114_0011_0FA02F645DBF14F0">
WERE there no civil government, laws, magi&s;tracy, nor <HI>Shields of the earth,</HI> for the pre&s;ervation of peace, the guard of liberty, the protection of property and the defence of life, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, and, without a &s;pirit of prophe&s;y, to foretell, what the event mu&s;t be:&mdash;that anarchy, confu&s;ion, blood and &s;laughter, wa&s;te and de&s;truction, would &s;oon take place in the earth.&mdash;The weak would be devoured by the &s;trong, the innocent, like <HI>righteous Abel,</HI> would become an ea&s;y prey to the vicious, abandoned and ambitious:&mdash;and the longe&s;t &s;word mu&s;t quickly determine the fate of mankind.</P>
<P>HENCE it appears, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, to a demon&s;tration, that, under GOD, the &s;upreme ruler, this wi&s;e in&s;titution of <HI>civil government,</HI> this riche&s;t of temporal ble&s;&s;ings to mankind, takes its ri&s;e from <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, rea&s;on teaches the propriety, convenience points out the advantages, and all the &s;ocial affections concur to urge the im|portance of civil government. But however engaging or intere&s;ting the&s;e arguments might appear, to the wi&s;e, the benevolent, or judi|cious, they would be, at be&s;t, but a feeble &s;upport to the peace and order of &s;ociety,&mdash;would never have availed to e&s;tabli&s;h govern|ment, over the lawle&s;s lu&s;ts of vicious, a&s;pi|ring, or blood-thir&s;ty men.&mdash;It is <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity, Nece&s;&s;ity alone,</HI> which combines men in
<PB N="9" REF="017114_0012_0FA02F655E03E238">
&s;ociety, and gives ri&s;e to civil government. And had not mankind been effectually con|vinced of <HI>this nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> and taught to realize that there was no living without it, it is very much a doubt, whether ever &s;uch an in&s;titu|tion would have taken place in the world.</P>
<P>THIS Nece&s;&s;ity, in a great mea&s;ure at lea&s;t, is founded in and takes ri&s;e from the lu&s;ts, the corruptions and vices of mankind.</P>
<P>'TIS not indeed pretended, that any one man, or any number of men, have any natural right of &s;uperiority, or inherent claim of domi|nion, or governmental authority over any other man, or body of men.&mdash;All men, by nature, are <HI>free, equal</HI> and <HI>independent,</HI> in this matter. It is in compact&mdash;<HI>in compact alone,</HI> that all ju&s;t government is founded.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;teps, in entering into &s;ociety and toward the e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil government among a people, is the forming, agreeing to, and ratifying an <HI>original compact,</HI> for the regu|lation of the State, de&s;cribing and determining the mode, departments and powers of govern|ment, and the rights, privileges and duties of the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>THIS &s;hould be done by the whole body of the people; or by princes, leaders, or dele|gates, by their choice, appointment, or con|&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="017114_0013_0FA02F6573756E70">
THIS right in the people, whether emer|ging from a &s;tate of nature, or the yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion, is <HI>an unalienable right</HI>&mdash;a right which cannot be given up by a people, even though ever &s;o much inclined to &s;ell or &s;acri|fice it.&mdash;Yea, &s;hould a people be &s;o lo&s;t to them&s;elves, as, upon any con&s;ideration, to give it up, it may ju&s;tly be <HI>re-claimed,</HI> at lea&s;t by the next generation, who cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be deprived of <HI>their birth-right,</HI> becau&s;e their progenitors, like <HI>E&s;au,</HI> de&s;pi&s;ed and par|ted with theirs.</P>
<P>WHILE the <HI>&s;ocial compact</HI> &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, the whole &s;tate, and all its members, are bound by it:&mdash;a &s;acred regard ought to be paid to it. No man, order, or body of men, in the &s;tate, have any right, power, or authority, to alter, change, or violate the &s;ocial compact. Nor can any change, alteration, or amendment, be lawful|ly introduced, but by common con&s;ent. Any and every attempt of this kind, endangers the whole.</P>
<P>IT remains, however, with the communi|ty, &s;tate, or nation, as a public, <HI>political body,</HI> at any time, at plea&s;ure, to change, alter, or even totally di&s;&s;olve the con&s;titution, and re|turn to a &s;tate of nature, or to form anew, as to them &s;hall &s;eem meet.</P>
<P>THESE principles admitted, it is evident <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no man, or body of men, however wi&s;e,
<PB N="11" REF="017114_0014_0FA02F6641566840">
great or good;&mdash;no &s;tate, nation, or power on earth, hath any right to make or impo&s;e a con&s;titution of government upon another &s;tate or nation: Such a con&s;titution, however free, is a <HI>mark</HI> of dependence, a <HI>badge of &s;lavery,</HI> the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought of which the high &s;pirit of a free people would ju&s;tly de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>EQUALITY and INDEPENDENCE are the <HI>ju&s;t claim,</HI> the <HI>indefea&s;ible birth-right</HI> of men:&mdash;In a &s;tate of nature, as individuals; in &s;ociety, as &s;tates or nations.&mdash;Nothing &s;hort of the&s;e ever did, or ever will &s;atisfy a man or a people, <HI>truly free, truly brave.</HI></P>
<P>TRUE it is, a conquered nation is obliged to &s;ubmit to the terms, the laws, the conquer|or is plea&s;ed to impo&s;e: But this being matter of compul&s;ion and not of choice, alters not the right. The claim to liberty and indepen|dence remains the &s;ame. When opportunity offers, and power is attained, it is, beyond di&s;|pute, the <HI>duty,</HI> as well as right, of &s;uch a peo|ple, of &s;uch a nation, to a&s;&s;ert their <HI>native li|berty,</HI> to &s;hake off the <HI>tyrant'</HI>s yoke, to main|tain their equality and independence among the nations; and either re&s;ume their former, or e&s;tabli&s;h a new con&s;titution of government, as they &s;hall judge be&s;t.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, this is a right, the viola|tion or infringement of which, upon any con|&s;ideration whatever, no man can ju&s;tify upon
<PB N="12" REF="017114_0015_0FA02F66E9967C00">
the principles of rea&s;on, the laws of nature, or rules of equity.&mdash;Even GOD him&s;elf, the &s;u|preme ruler of the world, who&s;e government is ab&s;olute and uncontroulable, hath ever paid a &s;acred attention to this <HI>important right;</HI> hath ever patroni&s;ed this <HI>intere&s;ting claim</HI> in the &s;ons of men.</P>
<P>THE only con&s;titution of civil government that can plead its origin, as immediately from heaven, is, <HI>The Theocracy of the Hebrews.</HI> But even this form of government, though dictated by <HI>infinite wi&s;dom,</HI> and wrote with the <HI>finger of</HI> GOD, was laid before his people for their con&s;ideration, and ratified, introduced and e|&s;tabli&s;hed by their common con&s;ent.</P>
<P>WHAT form of government will an&s;wer the be&s;t purpo&s;es to &s;ociety, and mo&s;t effectu|ally di&s;play the glory of the &s;upreme Ruler, in the good of mankind, is a que&s;tion truly deli|cate and important; and a que&s;tion, which, in the hand of a <HI>ma&s;terly politician,</HI> might admit of a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion both intere&s;ting and entertain|ing. But as neither time, nor capacity, will permit me to enter largely into &s;o high and critical a &s;ubject; it &s;hall &s;uffice to ob&s;erve,&mdash;</P>
<P>THAT a little acquaintance with the world and the hi&s;tory of mankind, in the &s;everal a|ges pa&s;t, will clearly decide, that no one con|&s;titution, or form of civil government, can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be equally adopted to an&s;wer the
<PB N="13" REF="017114_0016_0FA02F67BAF4FCB0">
be&s;t purpo&s;es of &s;uch an in&s;titution, in every &s;ociety, nation or &s;tate.</P>
<P>THAT in the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of &s;ociety, different modes of government have been a|dopted and introduced, at different &s;tages and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive periods, cannot be doubted.&mdash;And whether there hath not been, in many in&s;tan|ces, at lea&s;t, a gradation in the modes of go|vernment, keeping pace with the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, in the &s;everal ages of the world, &s;imi|lar to that gradation, which is ea&s;ily ob&s;erved in the &s;everal &s;tages and periods of human life; is a que&s;tion, with all deference, &s;ubmitted to the candor and judgment of this re&s;pectable a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>AT fir&s;t &s;ight, indeed, this circum&s;tance may not have been ob&s;erved; nor can it be &s;aid to have been the ca&s;e, without many ex|ceptions.

CIVIL government, duly e&s;tabli&s;hed and organized, is fitly compared to a <HI>Shield,</HI> as it is in&s;tituted for the defence and protection of the &s;ubjects and the &s;tate.

<P>GOOD and faithful rulers are rai&s;ed above their brethren, to places of honour, tru&s;t and authority, not for them&s;elves, but for the people, and the good of &s;ociety.

<P>IN this way, wi&s;e and faithful rulers are <HI>Shields</HI> to the &s;tate, and <HI>Shields of the earth;</HI> as by this happy in&s;titution, under their admi|ni&s;tration, the wi&s;dom and &s;trength of the whole &s;tate, may, at any time, be collected in

<P>IN this light con&s;idered, rulers, by accept|ing a &s;eat or an office in government, are fitly &s;aid to pledge them&s;elves, their faith and &s;acred honour, and that in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, to the people for their fidelity: and to them are they accountable.</P>

IS the election limited?&mdash;Still there is a choice,&mdash;A choice, which made with wi&s;dom and fidelity, may be of great utility to this Commonwealth.</P>
<P>IT is no impeachment of the abilities, ho|nor or integrity of any man, to &s;uppo&s;e, that, in a body of wi&s;e, great and good men, there may be different talents and improvements, and di&s;tinct characters, that may have an o|pening for exerci&s;e, and &s;hine with a peculiar lu&s;tre, in different departments of civil go|vernment.</P>
<P>WHAT the&s;e talents and characters are, how to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, in whom to be found and where to be placed, for the purpo&s;es of government, and be&s;t good of the Common|wealth, is not for me to determine.

<P>THE declining &s;tate of religion, morality and virtue; and the great prevalence of vice and immorality, irreligion and profanene&s;s, in almo&s;t every form, and in the various orders and ages of men; it is humbly conceived, are &s;ubjects, not only important in them&s;elves, but of the highe&s;t con&s;equence to the well|being of &s;ociety, and call aloud for the inter|po&s;ition of rulers, who are ordained of GOD to be <HI>a terror to evil doers</HI> and to <HI>evil works.</HI> In vain do the teachers of religion and even the <HI>amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t</HI> preach and teach the importance of religion, the excellence of virtue, and the nece&s;&s;ity of morality, ju&s;tice, tempe|rance, truth or righteou&s;ne&s;s; while vice, in its various forms, is winked at by authority, and iniquity e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</P>

<P>BUT after all, it is by example, <HI>a living ex|ample,</HI> of ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s, temperance and cha&s;tity, faithfulne&s;s and integrity; and that glorious a&s;&s;emblage of chri&s;tian graces and moral virtues, by which human nature is adorned, and &s;ociety rendered happy, that ru|lers give energy to laws, effectually &s;uppre&s;s vice in its various forms, encourage virtue, and introduce and promote a thorough reformation among a people.&mdash;Virtue in high &s;tations &s;hines with an increa&s;ed lu&s;tre, hath an exten|&s;ive influence, and &s;weetly atracts the atten|tion and engages the imitation of all around.&mdash;But without this, reproofs are in vain, puni&s;h|ments ineffectual, and laws to little or no pur|po&s;e.</P>

<Q><P>The taking of <HI>Praene&s;te</HI> and <HI>Norba</HI> put an end to the civil war in <HI>Italy. Sylla</HI> therefore, having placed in all the <HI>Italian</HI> provinces &s;uch governors as were intirely at his devotion, and pitched &s;everal little camps in different di&s;tricts, to keep the country in awe, returned to <HI>Rome,</HI> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch he entered at the head of his troops. The &s;ame day he a&s;&s;embled the people in the <HI>Comitium,</HI> and told them with an h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y air, that he had conquered: but that tho&s;e who had made him take up arms again&s;t his country, &s;hould expiate the blood they had made him &s;hed, with their own. <HI>I will not &s;pare one,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>who has borne arms again&s;t me. They &s;hall all peri&s;h to a man.</HI> The&s;e words, from a man who was ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of their lives &amp; fortunes, made the mo&s;t re&s;olute tremble. They filled the whole city with dread and horror; and the con&s;ternation was doubled the next day, when they &s;aw fixed up in all public places, a li&s;t of pro&s;cribed per&s;ons, containing the names of <HI>forty &s;enators</HI> and <HI>&s;ix|teen hundred knights.</HI> If any man gave &s;helter to a per&s;on pro&s;cribed, though his &s;on, his brother, or his father, death was the certain reward of his humanity; whereas the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in was recompenced with two talents, though a &s;lave had murdered his ma&s;ter, or a &s;on his father.&mdash;The <HI>tyrent</HI> cho&s;e &s;uch agents to execute his decrees, as had even le&s;s pity than him&s;elf. The chief of tho&s;e was the infamous <HI>Cataline.</HI>&mdash;At the head of a band of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, he &s;coured the &s;treets, and killed many knights and &s;enators before they knew they were pro&s;cribed. The per&s;ons named in the li&s;t were &s;ought for in their own hou&s;es, in the porticoes, and even in the temples; whence they were dragged to <HI>Sylla,</HI> and cruelly butchered in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The ma&s;&s;acre was not confined to tho&s;e named in the li&s;t. <HI>Sylla</HI> extended his revenge to all who had borne arms again&s;t him, of what rank &s;oever, or condi|tion. Nay, his cruel agents took this opportunity to gratify their private revenge and avarice, confounding the mo&s;t innocent and peaceable with the mo&s;t guilty, out of &s;ome private grudge, or purely for the &s;ake of their wealth and rich furniture. In &s;hort, the &s;laugh|ter was &s;o dreadful, that <HI>Sylla</HI> was reproached with it even by his be&s;t friends. Among others, a young &s;ena|tor, named <HI>Caius Metellus,</HI> ventured one day to a&s;k him in full &s;enate, when he de&s;igned to put a &s;top to the calamities of his fellow citizens. <HI>We do not inter|cede</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>for &s;uch as you have re&s;olved to de&s;troy: but only de&s;ire you to free tho&s;e from unea&s;ine&s;s, whom you have determined to &s;ave. Sylla,</HI> without &s;eeming to take this bold &s;peech ami&s;s, an&s;wered cooly, that he knew not yet whom he &s;hould &s;ave. <HI>Name to us then,</HI> replied <HI>Metellus, tho&s;e you are determined to de&s;troy, That I will do,</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Sylla,</HI> very &s;martly, and im|mediately cau&s;ed a new li&s;t to be fixed up of <HI>eighty ci|tizens,</HI> whom he pro&s;cribed, mo&s;t of them &s;enators, and per&s;ons of great di&s;tinction. The next day he pro&s;cri|bed <HI>two hundred and twenty</HI> more, and an equal num|ber the third. Among the&s;e was <HI>Marcus Marius,</HI> who was nearly related to the great <HI>Marius,</HI> and highly fa|voured by the people.&mdash;He was &s;eized by <HI>Cataline,</HI> and put to death, after having &s;uffered the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torments tyranny could invent. He was whipped thro' all the &s;treets of <HI>Rome,</HI> and, after this ignominious pu|ni&s;hment, carried beyond the <HI>Tyber,</HI> where by <HI>Sylla's</HI> barbarous agents, his eyes were put out, his hands and ears cut off, his tongue torn out, all his joints di&s;located, and his bones broken. One <HI>Marcus Plaetorius,</HI> being moved at &s;uch an affecting &s;ight, could not help pitying the unfortunate young man; which &s;o offended <HI>Sylla,</HI> that he ordered him to be killed on the &s;pot And now after <HI>nine thou&s;and</HI> &s;enators, knights, and citizens had been inhumanly murdered by <HI>Sylla's</HI> agents, he a&s;&s;em|bled the people, and told them, that he had pro&s;cribed as many as he could think of at pre&s;ent: and as for tho&s;e he had forgot, they &s;hould be pro&s;cribed too, as &s;oon as he could call them to his memory!</P></Q>
<P>This was the &s;cene in the city of <HI>Rome</HI>&mdash;What awful havock, then, mu&s;t the &s;ame mea&s;ures of cruelty have made in the other cities and &s;tates of that great Common|wealth!&mdash;But no comment is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
