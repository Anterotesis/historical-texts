<P>A BLACKSMITH in a country town, while &s;hoeing a hor&s;e, was gazed at by a num|ber of negroes as they were pa&s;&s;ing by; being a little piqued at being the object of the blacks' at|tention, and attempting to ca&s;t a &s;lur upon them, he &s;aid, "<HI>I believe hell's broke loo&s;e.</HI>"&mdash;"<HI>Yes, ma&s;&s;a,</HI>" &s;ays one, "<HI>I &s;ee de devil got hold de hor&s;e's foot.</HI>"</P>
<P N="2">2. A trade&s;man, who&s;e love of money made him pre&s;cribe, as beneficial to his &s;ervants' health, and his own profit, <HI>the practice of early ri&s;ing,</HI> one morning gave a poor <HI>black man</HI> a &s;evere &s;colding for &s;uffering the &s;un to &s;hine on him while in bed&mdash;concluding his lectures with a &s;evere threat, if he &s;hould ever after find him not up at &s;un ri&s;e. "At &s;unri&s;e, ma&s;&s;a?" a&s;ked the hone&s;t African, in the native &s;im|plicity of his &s;oul&mdash;it was worth a ca&s;ket of dia|monds to him&mdash;"At &s;un-ri&s;e, ma&s;&s;a? But &s;uppo&s;e, ma&s;&s;a, the &s;un ri&s;e before day-light&mdash;what &s;hall I do den, &s;ir?" The ma&s;ter made no reply, and <HI>Sambo</HI> was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3">3. A very pious gentleman, but rather worldly, who lives not many miles from Bo&s;ton, made it his con&s;tant practice to call up his family before day, in order that they might attend prayers, and be ready for their labour in good &s;ea&s;on: one morning having mu&s;tered his family rather earlier than com|mon, he commenced family duties by prayer, during which, he returned thanks to the Lord, that they

were brought to &s;ee the light of <HI>another day:</HI> an old negro &s;tanding by, cried out, "<HI>Top, top, vate a bit, no day yet, ma&s;&s;a, &s;artin, no day yet.</HI>"</P>

North Carolina, wrote to one of the principal &s;hippers in London, an order to &s;end out thirty thou&s;and <HI>black tacks;</HI> the writing being indifferent, the gentleman thought it meant <HI>black jacks;</HI> and al|though the order appeared a little romantic, he u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavours to comply with it. After collecting in London, Birmingham and Sheffield, he could only glean up ten thou&s;and, which he di&s;|patched with an apology that he could not then complete the order, but was in hopes in a &s;hort time <HI>he &s;hould be able to &s;end the remainder.</HI></P>

When the French &s;leet, during the late war, entered the Briti&s;h channel, the Engli&s;h fleet under &s;ir Charles Hardy, &s;tood away, as if bearing for port; a jack tar, on board the Royal George, &s;ee|ing this proceeding, went below, and bringing up his hammock, went to the head of the &s;hip, which had the figure of George II. for its ornament&mdash;"<HI>Let me, old boy,</HI>" &s;aid he, "<HI>muffle you, for damn me but it would hurt you too much to &s;ee us running away.</HI>"</P>
<P N="6">6. Mr. Mackenzie, who has &s;ometimes been cal|led the Scots <HI>Addi&s;on,</HI> is by profe&s;&s;ion an attorney. He was lately in company with &s;ir William Howe, in the Highlands of Scotland. After dinner, the conver&s;ation happened to turn upon poi&s;on; the va|rious effects of different &s;pecies were mentioned, and among others, tho&s;e of rat&s;bane and laurel water. "We &s;ay in England," &s;aid the general to mr. Mackenzie, "that <HI>rat&s;bane</HI> will not kill a lawyer."&mdash;"And we &s;ay in Scotland," replied the wit, "that &s;ome generals are in no danger from <HI>laurel.</HI>"</P>

in the mouth, was acco&s;ted by an old acquaintance, with, "how are you, my buck? don't you feel very ugly at pre&s;ent?" "very ugly, indeed," replied the valetudinarian&mdash;"that's not to be wondered at nei|ther," replies the other, "for ever &s;ince I fir&s;t &s;aw you, I always look'd upon you to be a <HI>d&mdash;d ugly fellow.</HI>"</P>
<P N="8">8. Some years &s;ince, one <HI>Tom Hide,</HI> an Indian, famous for his cunning, went into a tavern at Brook|field, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and after a little talk, told the landlord, he had been hunting, had killed a fine fat deer, and that if he would give him a quart of rum, he would tell him where it was.&mdash;The land|lord did not wi&s;h to let &s;lip &s;o good an opportunity to obtain the veni&s;on, and immediately mea&s;ured the Indian his rum&mdash;"Well," &s;ays Tom, "do you know where the great meadow is?" "Yes"&mdash;"Well, do you know, where the great marked maple|tree that &s;tands in it, is?"&mdash;"Yes"&mdash;"Well there lies the deer." A way po&s;ted the taverner with his team, in que&s;t of his purcha&s;e: he found the meadow and the tree, it is true; but his &s;earchings after the deer were in vain; and he returned no heavier, but in chagrin, than he went. Some days after, he met the Indian, and violently accu&s;ed him of the deception. Tom heard him out, and with the coolne&s;s of a phi|lo&s;opher replied, "did you not find the meadow, as I &s;aid?"&mdash;"Yes," "and the tree?"&mdash;"Yes"&mdash;"and the deer?"&mdash;"No."&mdash;"Very good," con|tinues he&mdash;"you found <HI>two truths to one lie, which was very well for an Indian.</HI>"</P>
<P N="9">9. A certain <HI>trading ju&s;tice</HI> in Bo&s;ton, notorious for his <HI>profe&s;&s;ional ingenuity,</HI> &s;ome time &s;ince employ|ed a poor man to &s;aw a load of wood, for which he agreed to give him <HI>eighteen-pence.</HI> The man, in order to be more expeditious in the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;tripped off his coat and laid it in the &s;treet.&mdash;After fini&s;hing the job, he found, to his &s;urpri&s;e, that the coat had
<PB N="6" REF="021642_0006_0FB4EA4EB8494958">
vani&s;hed, and a&s;king the ju&s;tice, who had been at the door, nearly the whole time, if he had &s;een any thing of it&mdash;the worthy magi&s;trate replied, "he had <HI>found</HI> a coat in the &s;treet," and producing it de|&s;ired to know, "if he could &s;wear to the property;" on the poor man's an&s;wering in the affirmative, he proceeded to admini&s;ter the oath: after which, on re&s;toring the coat, he &s;hrewdly ob&s;erved to the poor fellow, <HI>that they were now clear of each other, the price of the work being eighteen pence, and his fees amounting to the &s;ame.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. A few years &s;ince, &s;ome boys, equipped in mock military accoutrements, &s;uch as paper-caps, paper-belts, wooden &s;words, &amp;c. were beating up for recruits in Parliament-&s;treet, Bo&s;ton; their &s;er|jeant made a &s;tand at a corner, and a number of peo|ple &s;oon collected about him, among whom were &s;ome officers of the Briti&s;h army, of the delicate ca&s;t, then quartered in Bo&s;ton: young Kite delivered his &s;peech at the drum-head; after which many boys, candidates for military fame, pre&s;ented them|&s;elves to be enli&s;ted, were approved, and after hav|ing received dumps, in lieu of entrance-money, join|ed the party: among the re&s;t, a wretched little boy, bow-legged and otherwi&s;e deformed, offered him&s;elf as a volunteer to this corps of real <HI>infantry:</HI> on his approach, &s;erjeant Kite, with a profound import|ance, cocked his hat, and after viewing him cap-a|pee, with an air of &s;upreme importance, "&s;irrah," &s;ays he, "what do you mean? how dur&s;t you in&s;ult his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice you a &s;oldier! why you are a di&s;grace to human nature; march off directly, or I &s;hall cha&s;ti&s;e your pre&s;umption." On this the poor rejected lad was retiring apace, when an arch boy, eyeing the &s;pectators in &s;carlet with a look &s;hrewdly expre&s;&s;ive, at the &s;ame time pulling the &s;erjeant by the &s;leeve, "<HI>&s;ir,</HI>" &s;ays he, "<HI>call him back, call him back, he'll <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for an officer.</HI>"</P>
<P N="11">11. During the late war, an Engli&s;h frigate hav|ing come up the Patowmac, a party was landed,
<PB N="7" REF="021642_0007_0FB4EA5258B7ED38">
who &s;et fire to and de&s;troyed &s;ome gentlemen's hou&s;es on the Maryland &s;ide in &s;ight of mount Ver|non, general Wa&s;hington's hou&s;e; after which the captain, (I think captain Greaves of the Actaeon) &s;ent a boat on &s;hore to the general's, demanding a large &s;upply of provi&s;ions, &amp;c. with a menace of burning it, likewi&s;e, in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al. To which mr. Lund Wa&s;hington replied, "That when gene|ral Wa&s;hington engaged in the conte&s;t, he had put all to the &s;take, and was well aware of the expo|&s;ed &s;ituation of his hou&s;e and property; in con&s;e|quence of which, he had given him orders by no means to comply with any &s;uch demands, for that he would make no unworthy compromi&s;e with the enemy, and was ready to meet the fate of his neigh|bours" The captain was highly incen&s;ed on receiv|ing this an&s;wer, and removed his frigate to the Vir|ginia &s;hore; but before he commenced his operati|ons, he &s;ent another me&s;&s;age to the &s;ame purport, offering likewi&s;e a pa&s;&s;port to mr. Wa&s;hington to come on board: he went accordingly in the boat, carrying with him a &s;mall pre&s;ent of poultry, of which he begged the captain's acceptance. His pre&s;ence produced the be&s;t effect&mdash;he was ho&s;pita|bly received, notwith&s;tanding he repeated the &s;ame &s;entiments with the &s;ame firmne&s;s. The captain ex|pre&s;&s;ed his per&s;onal re&s;pect for the character of the general, commending the character of mr. Lund Wa&s;hington, and a&s;&s;ured him, nothing but his hav|ing mi&s;conceived the terms of the fir&s;t an&s;wer, could have induced him for a moment to conceive the idea of taking the &s;malle&s;t mea&s;ure offen&s;ive to &s;o illu&s;trious a character as the general, explaining at the &s;ame time the real or &s;uppo&s;ed provocations which had com|pelled his &s;everity, on the other &s;ide of the river. Mr. Wa&s;hington, after &s;pending &s;ome time in per|fect harmony on board, returned, and in&s;tantly di&s;|patched &s;heep, hogs, and an abundant &s;upply of other articles, <HI>as a pre&s;ent to the Engli&s;h frigate.</HI></P>

12. The con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania makes a year's re&s;idence in the &s;tate, and payment of taxes, the &s;ole requi&s;ites to qualify a man for an elector.</P>
<P>At an election, when parties were violent, each warmly canva&s;&s;ing for &s;uffrages, a captain of a &s;hip, then lying at the wharf, took his &s;eamen to a ma|gi&s;trate, paid a tax for each, and procured a certifi|cate of the payment&mdash;then putting &s;uch tickets or votes in their hands, as he plea&s;ed, led them to the &s;tate-hou&s;e, where they all lodged their votes.</P>
<P>On the return of the &s;hip the next voyage, ju&s;t before &s;he arrived in Delaware bay, &s;he was &s;urround|ed by a va&s;t multitude of porpoi&s;es, pur&s;uing a we&s;terly cour&s;e with the &s;hip. "See here," &s;ays one of the &s;ailors, to his &s;hip-mate, "what a mer|ry company we have." "Yes, d&mdash;n 'em," replies Jack, "<HI>they are driving for Philadelphia, I believe, to pay taxes, and vote for a&s;&s;emblymen.</HI>" The cap|tain, who was then walking on the quarter deck, heard the &s;arca&s;tic wag, and &s;miled, but &s;aid not a word.</P>
<P N="13">13. A very worthy man in a neighbouring &s;tate, was remarkable for his ab&s;ence of mind. In one of his profound reveries, he &s;addled his hor&s;e to carry a bag of corn to a mill at &s;ome di&s;tance, but forget|ting to place the bag and him&s;elf too upon the hor&s;e, he took the corn upon his own &s;houlders, led the hor&s;e and marched nearly a mile, before he di&s;cover|ed his mi&s;take. At length one of his neighbours met him, and to his great &s;urpri&s;e, a&s;ked him whe|ther it would not be ea&s;ier for him to let his hor&s;e carry the bag of corn? The man took the hint, laid the load upon his hor&s;e, and proceeded on his way.</P>

<P N="15">15. Soon after the &s;ettlement of Virginia, cap|tain Smith, then pre&s;ident of the council, conduct|ed a party of men a few miles from James-town, to cut timber.&mdash;Among the re&s;t were <HI>two gentlemen,</HI> who had not been u&s;ed to labour. As they were at work, their fingers began to be bli&s;tered, and the pain of holding their axes was &s;uch as to extort an oath at every third blow. To prevent this, the pre|&s;ident ordered the oaths each day to be numbered, and at night condemned each man to have a cann of water for each oath poured into his &s;leeve. The&s;e wa&s;hings had the de&s;ired effect, and it was after|wards rare to hear an oath in a week.</P>
<P N="16">16. Some years &s;ince, an Indian re&s;ided in the metropolis of a neighbouring &s;tate; he gained his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by his indu&s;try, and being a very handy fellow, he was frequently employed by many in the city, particularly by the governor. The Indian, who&s;e name was Jo&s;eph, took the liberty of enquir|ing of the governor, how it came to pa&s;s he had &s;o many fine things about him and never worked any? The governor replied that he got them by head|work. Joe wi&s;hed to be in&s;tructed in the my&s;tery, but was informed his &s;cull was too thick for it.
<PB N="10" REF="021642_0010_0FB4EA56CEE5CFF0">
Some time after, Joe was &s;ent for by the governor, who demanded to know what he would have for killing a calf? Joe &s;aid, he would do it for two &s;hillings: he was de&s;ired to go to the &s;table and per|form the bu&s;ine&s;s; he went, cut the calf's throat, and left him lying there; after &s;ome delay he went to the hou&s;e, and received his pay: &s;oon after the governor went to &s;ee how his veal looked, but was a&s;toni&s;hed to find the calf lying dead, and nothing more done to it. He &s;ent for the Indian, repri|manded him &s;everely for treating him &s;o. Joe in&s;i&s;ted that he had complied fully with his agreement; &s;ay|ing he had killed the calf, and that for two &s;hillings more he would dre&s;s it, a&s;king the governor, <HI>if that was not &s;omething like head-work?</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. When the American war was warmly agita|ed by the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, mrs. <HI>Wright,</HI> who was modelling the head of lord North, anxious to hear &s;omething re&s;pecting her native country, waited on him, to &s;ee how far &s;he had improved in the like|ne&s;s: and &s;oon turned the conver&s;ation to the affairs of America. She a&s;&s;ured him of the little probability of &s;ucce&s;s, and with her u&s;ual warmth declared, that if he did not immediately recall the troops, and make atonement for the blood that had already been &s;hed, he &s;hould lo&s;e his head. He laughed, and told her, it was of little con&s;equence, re&s;pecting him&s;elf, as long as he pre&s;erved her friend&s;hip, which at all events he &s;hould be careful to do: for you know, mrs. Wright, continued he, if they &s;hould cut my head off, <HI>'tis in your power to make me ano|ther.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. Some years ago, immediately after the &s;hock of a tremendous earthquake had alarmed the inhabi|tants of Grenada, the conver&s;ation turned at the go|vernor's table, upon the latent occa&s;ion of the above phaenomenon; after every one of the company had a&s;&s;igned it to a different cau&s;e, an old negro woman was a&s;ked, what was her opinion on the &s;ubject; &s;he

<P N="19">19. Several runaway negroes being condemned to be hanged, one was offered his life, on condition of being the executioner. He refu&s;ed it: he would &s;ooner die. The ma&s;ter fixed on another of his &s;laves to perform the office. "Stay," &s;aid this la&s;t, "'till I prepare my&s;elf." He in&s;tantly retired to his hut, and cut off his wri&s;t with an axe. Return|ing to his ma&s;ter, "now," &s;aid he, "compel me, if you can, to hang my comrades."</P>
<P N="20">20. In the year 1785, a farmer of Bucks' county, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his people, working in harve&s;t, killed a rattle-&s;nake; and &s;oon after having occa&s;ion to go home, took up by mi&s;take his &s;on's jacket, and put it on; the &s;on was a &s;tripling, and both their jack|ets were made of the &s;ame kind of cloth. The old man being warm, did not button the jacket until he got to the hou&s;e, then found it much too little for him; he in&s;tantly conceived the idea, that he had been imperceptibly bitten by the rattle-&s;nake, and &s;welled from the effects of the poi&s;on; he grew &s;ud|denly very ill, and was put to bed. The people about him were very much alarmed, and &s;ent for two or three phy&s;icians; one of whom poured down his throat a pint of melted lard&mdash;another gave him a do&s;e of wild plantain&mdash;and the third made him drink hoar hound tea, made very &s;trong. Notwith&s;tand+ing all, he grew wor&s;e and was to appearance on the verge of di&s;&s;olution, when his &s;on came home, with the old gentleman's jacket hanging like a bag about him. The whole my&s;tery was at once unravelled, and the poor farmer, notwith&s;tanding his drenches of hogs'-fat, plantain and hoarhound, was well in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P N="21">21. While doctor <HI>Franklin</HI> was at Paris la&s;t war, he happened to mention at his table, that he had but little Madeira wine; upon which an American gue&s;t &s;ent him three dozen. A few days afterwards,
<PB N="12" REF="021642_0012_0FB4EA59C5D3B300">
this gentleman was thrown into the Ba&s;tile, and confined there &s;everal weeks without the lea&s;t intima|tion of what he was accu&s;ed of; only on his earne&s;t enquiry, one of the officers told him he was afraid it would go hard with him, and a&s;ked him whether he was a catholic, and would be attended by a prie&s;t, which he, being a prote&s;tant, refu&s;ed. After &s;ome time a battle of wine was brought, and he was a&s;k|ed whether he knew what wine it was, and was or|dered to drink it: he complied, and an&s;wered that he believed it was &s;ome of his own Madeira. At length he was relea&s;ed, and then he di&s;covered that doctor Franklin had been taken ill, &s;oon after he received his pre&s;ent, and it was imagined that he had been hired by the <HI>Engli&s;h court to poi&s;on the doctor.</HI></P>
<P N="22">22. At the &s;iege of Charle&s;ton, an American &s;ol|dier had been bribed to convey to the enemy a plan and &s;tate of the works, ammunition, &amp;c. After he had pa&s;&s;ed the lines, he was di&s;covered by the pi|qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">; who, having repeatedly called on him to return, were at length obliged to fire at him, and wounded him &s;o that he could not proceed. Upon examining the papers with which he was charged, they were found &s;o accurately and ingeniou&s;ly exe|cuted, that general Lincoln was convinced they were the work of another hand, and offered the &s;ol|dier his life, provided he would di&s;cover the per&s;on in the garri&s;on, who had employed him. This offer was rejected, with an ob&s;ervation, that he knew the ri&s;que which accompanied his attempt, and had re|ceived an adequate con&s;ideration. The u&s;ual ar|rangements were therefore made for his execution, and the rope being tied about his neck, the general hoped that &s;uch circum&s;tances might have &s;haken his fortitude, and &s;ent an aid-de-camp to make another tender of pardon upon the &s;ame terms. "No!" ex|claimed the re&s;olute victim, "you have my life in your power, but my honour is my own." The &s;ig|nal

<P N="256">256. Dr. John&s;on coming up Fleet-&s;treet, at about two o'clock in the morning, was alarmed by a per&s;on &s;eemingly in great di&s;tre&s;s. He followed the voice for &s;ome time, when, by the glimmer of an expiring lamp, he perceived an unhappy female, al|mo&s;t naked, and peri&s;hing on a tru&s;s of &s;traw, who had ju&s;t &s;trength enough to tell him, "&s;he was turn|ed out by an inhuman landlord in that condition, and to beg his charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance not to let her die in the &s;treet." The doctor, melted at this &s;tory, de&s;i|red her to place her confidence in God, for that under him he would be her protector. He accord|ingly looked out for a coach to put her into; but there was none to be had: his charity however, was too &s;trong to be cooled by &s;uch an accident. He kneeled down by her &s;ide, rai&s;ed her in his arms, wrapped his great coat about her, placed her on his back, and in this condition carried her home to his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Next day her di&s;order appearing to be <HI>venereal,</HI> he was advi&s;ed to abandon her; but he replied, "that may be as much her misfortune as her fault; I am determined to give her the chance of a reformation;" he accordingly kept her in his hou&s;e above thirteen weeks, where &s;he was regularly attended by a phy&s;i|cian, who recovered her.</P>
<P>The doctor, during this time learned more of her &s;tory, and finding her to be one of tho&s;e unhappy women, who are impelled to this mi&s;erable life more from nece&s;&s;ity than inclination, he &s;et on foot a &s;ub|&s;cription, and e&s;tabli&s;hed her in a milliner's &s;hop in the country, where &s;he was living &s;ome years ago in very con&s;iderable repute.</P>

Mr. Savage then imagined his ta&s;k over, and expected that &s;ir Richard would call for the reckoning, and return home: but his expecta|tions deceived him; for &s;ir Richard told him that he was without money, and that the pamphlet mu&s;t be &s;old, before the dinner could be paid for; and Sa|vage was therefore obliged to go and offer their new production for &s;ale for two guineas, which with &s;ome difficulty he obtained.

During the protector&s;hip of Oliver Crom|well, a de&s;ign was formed for re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the Jews, with full liberty to carry on trade, and exer|ci&s;e their religion; but though this affair met with violent oppo&s;ition from the heads of the different &s;ectaries, yet Oliver &s;o far carried his point, as to encourage a &s;mall body of them to &s;ettle in their old quarter, under the direction of Manna&s;&s;eh Ben-I&s;rael, a great rabbi, who &s;oon built a &s;ynagogue and publicly performed divine wor&s;hip.

If I had thought (continued he) that you had not &s;een it, I would have brought it with me. Upon this mr.

confederates, the king u&s;ed &s;ometimes to re&s;ide at the head-quarters him&s;elf. It happened, that a very fine hor&s;e, which he had lately purcha&s;ed, was ex|erci&s;ed before his tent, and among others who had gathered round to &s;ee him, was a corporal, who hav|ing been that afternoon too free with <HI>aqua vitae,</HI> was become as great a man as his maje&s;ty. He had &s;trolled up to the &s;pot, and getting within the cir|cle, put him&s;elf into an attitude of con&s;equence, and after having &s;ome time made his ob&s;ervations with the air of a profound connoi&s;&s;eur, he thru&s;ts a quid of tobacco into his mouth, and &s;wore it was as fine a creature as ever he &s;aw, and as well broke; then tottering up to the groom who had been riding it, and was ju&s;t di&s;mounted, a&s;ked him who was the owner: at this moment the king came out from his tent, and overhearing the corporal's que&s;tion, with whom he had already been diverted, told him cour|teou&s;ly, that the hor&s;e was his: the corporal made his maje&s;ty a &s;light compliment by moving his hat, and then &s;etting his arms akimbo, told him, that his rea&s;on for a&s;king was, that he had taken a liking to the hor&s;e and was inclined to buy him. The king &s;aid, he had no intention to &s;ell him, but if it would oblige him he would treat with him on the &s;ame &s;pot the next morning. The corporal, thru&s;ting out his hand, cried, <HI>a match;</HI> to which the king con|&s;ented, and rode off, giving private orders that no puni&s;hment &s;hould be inflicted upon the corporal, but that he &s;hould be brought before him the next morning. In the morning, when the poor fellow was told what had pa&s;&s;ed, and conducted to the king's tent, he was &s;eized by a dreadful panic, le&s;t his in&s;olence and drunkenne&s;s might co&s;t him his life. Into the pre&s;ence, however, he was carried; and the king, who intended only &s;ome &s;port, a&s;ked him, if he was the man that would la&s;t night have bought his hor&s;e? <HI>No, an't plea&s;e your maje&s;ty,</HI> &s;ays the fellow, <HI>that man went away at three o'clock this

Accordingly he was &s;uffered to pa&s;s into the duke's bed chamber one morning early, on pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s from the queen. As &s;oon as the duke ca&s;t his eyes on him, he &s;poke thus: <Q>I know thy bu&s;ine&s;s, friend, thou art &s;ent to take away my life. What hurt have I done thee? It is now in my power, with a word, to have thee cut to pieces before my face. But I pardon thee, go thy way and &s;ee my face no more.</Q> The gentleman, &s;tung with his own guilt, and a&s;toni&s;hed at the excellent nature of this prince, fell on his knees, confe&s;&s;ed his de&s;ign, and who employed him; but fearing to tarry in France, he immediately de|parted the kingdom, and entered him&s;elf into the &s;ervice of the king of Spain.</P>
