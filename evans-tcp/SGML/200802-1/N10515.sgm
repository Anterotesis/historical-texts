<Q><HI>Deliver me from the oppre&s;&s;ion of</HI> MAN, <HI>&s;o will I keep thy precepts.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN &s;ea&s;ons of great difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s we are very apt to look too much to &s;econd cau&s;es, and to forget that whatever evil or calamity is brought upon us, the hand of the Lord is in it, and that it is to him that we mu&s;t ultimately repair for &s;uccor and deliverance. In vain is &s;alvation hoped for from the hills or from the multitude of the mountains: In vain is it to tru&s;t in men of "low degree who are vanity, or in men of high degree who are a lie, and if they are laid in the ballance are altogether lighter than vanity." There is none we can repair unto with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s, but unto him who is "wi&s;e in heart and mighty in &s;trength," who is a mo&s;t merciful and compa&s;&s;ionate be|ing, and who &s;tiles him&s;elf the "judge of the fatherle&s;s and the oppre&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>WE ought to e&s;teem it an un&s;peakable pri|vilege that we are allowed, in all our &s;traits and perplexities, to &s;eek to "the father of lights" with hopes of audience and acceptance, through Chri&s;t the glorious mediator.</P>
<P>THE P&s;almi&s;t was a pattern of prayer and of filial tru&s;t and confidence in God, as the all wi&s;e and mo&s;t powerful deliverer of his people. In
<PB N="6" REF="013329_0004_0F8FFA5F08801A08">
the ver&s;e immediately preceeding our text, he prays that his life and conver&s;ation might be regulated and directed by the rules and max|ims of God's holy word. In our text he looks to God to deliver him from tho&s;e injuries and abu&s;es to which he was &s;ubjected from men. <HI>Deliver me from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man:</HI> By this he probably intended, the per&s;ecution of Saul, his cruel and mo&s;t inveterate enemy, who, not|with&s;tanding all his profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and regard for him, continually &s;ought his life. The P&s;almi&s;t adds, <HI>So will I keep thy precepts.</HI> By this he does not intimate, that he would not keep them, if he was not delivered from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man; becau&s;e a due ob&s;erv|ance of the precepts of God was indi&s;putably incumbent on him at all times, and under all circum&s;tances: but the meaning is, that if he was delivered he would endeavor to &s;erve God with greater vigor and chearfulne&s;s than ever before; and that he &s;hould look upon this as a fre&s;h obligation to devote him&s;elf entirely to the honor and &s;ervice of God.</P>
<P>IN further di&s;cour&s;ing upon the words, I &s;hall endeavor to &s;hew,</P>
<P>I. WHAT is to be under&s;tood in general, by the oppre&s;&s;ion of man.</P>
<P>II. THAT deliverance from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man is a ble&s;&s;ing to be &s;ought for from God. <HI>Deliver me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>III. THAT while we &s;eek deliverance from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man, it is fit that we &s;hould engage to &s;erve God with fre&s;h vigor and diligence upon the obtainment of it. <HI>So will I keep thy precepts.</HI></P>
<P>I. WE are to con&s;ider what is to be under|&s;tood in general by the oppre&s;&s;ion of man.</P>

'THIS is the depriving per&s;ons, either of their properties or privileges, in an unju&s;t and violent manner. Men are guilty of oppre&s;&s;ion whenever they offer violence to men's bodies, to their e&s;tates or to their con&s;ciences, or in any way whatever deprive them of any of tho&s;e enjoyments to which they have a ju&s;t and in|di&s;putable right. Whenever men endeavor to cru&s;h and overburden their fellow creatures, as the Egyptians did the Hebrews, by rigorous and unrea&s;onable requirements; or when they impo&s;e upon the con&s;ciences of men, and per&s;e|cute them becau&s;e they differ in opinion from them, they ju&s;tly de&s;erve the name of oppre&s;|&s;ors.'</P>
<P>"THIS is an abu&s;e of that power, which is committed to men &s;olely for the good of others, to unju&s;t and uncharitable u&s;es," to the injury and ruin of tho&s;e whom it was de&s;igned to protect and &s;upport. When we con&s;ider men as partaking of the &s;ame common nature, as being mutually dependant upon one another for their happine&s;s, and as being alike &s;ubject to the calamities and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of this mortal life; we might naturally be led to &s;uppo&s;e that they would have a tender affection for each other, and do all that lies in their power to pro|mote one another's be&s;t intere&s;t. But the conduct of mankind in all ages, utterly di&s;appoints the&s;e rea&s;onable expectations. The great and pow|erful have always been di&s;po&s;ed to trample upon tho&s;e who are in a weak and defencele&s;s &s;tate. Therefore God hath enjoined it upon his people, not to oppre&s;s the widow nor the fatherle&s;s, the &s;tranger nor the poor.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer, vii. 6. Zac. vii 10.</NOTE> Thou &s;halt neither vex a &s;tranger nor oppre&s;s him, &s;ays he, for ye were &s;trangers in the land of Egypt. Ye &s;hall not afflict any widow nor

fatherle&s;s child; if thou afflict them in any wi&s;e, and they cry at all unto me I will &s;urely hear their cry.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ex. xxii. 21.</NOTE> As men are naturally upon an exact equality, none can have any right to &s;trip others of any of tho&s;e advantages which they enjoy: nor has any one any ju&s;t authority over his fellow creatures, which is not deligat|ed to him by common con&s;ent, for the general welfare and happine&s;s. Whenever therefore, tho&s;e who are exalted to places of power, act contrary to this great end of their in&s;titution, they are no other than tyrants and oppre&s;&s;ors. And indeed power is of &s;uch an encroaching nature, that a great part of mankind are now ab&s;olutely &s;ubject to the will of others. How few nations are there left wherein there is the lea&s;t &s;hadow of civil or religious liberty! What innumerable multitudes are there now groan|ing under the in&s;upportable load of tyranny and per&s;ecution! In this view the Apo&s;tle's language is applicable; 'the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.'<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 22.</NOTE> God has in his all wi&s;e providence &s;uf|fered his true &s;aints and &s;ervants to be greatly oppre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted. Many of them have not only been deprived of every enjoy|ment of life, but have been put to death, in a mo&s;t cruel and mercile&s;s manner, on account of their adherence to the truth.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable that there are no creatures that inhabit the earth that prey upon one another, except men; every other &s;pecies of creatures &s;eems to be tender of tho&s;e of the &s;ame kind; but men who are endowed with rea&s;on and under&s;tanding and created in the image of God, &s;eem to delight in horra&s;&s;ing and de&s;troying one another. The oppre&s;&s;ion of man is the mo&s;t intolerable that we can be
<PB N="9" REF="013329_0007_0F8FFA634CD66850">
&s;ubjected to. It cannot therefore be thought &s;trange that the P&s;almi&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ired that he might be delivered from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man. This leads to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>II. THAT deliverance from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man, is a ble&s;&s;ing to be &s;ought for from God. <HI>Deliver me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>IT may be proper here to con&s;ider the pecu|liar fitne&s;s and propriety of applying to God for deliverance from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man; and the temper and di&s;po&s;ition with which we mu&s;t implore this ble&s;&s;ing of God, if we would hope to obtain it. I. We are to con&s;ider the peculiar fitne&s;s and propriety of applying to God for deliverance from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man.</P>
<P>THE glorious excellencies and perfections of God, render him the &s;uitable and infinitely worthy object of our adre&s;&s;es and &s;upplications. He not only knows all tho&s;e difficulties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which any of his creatures are &s;ub|jected, but he is al&s;o perfectly acquainted with the be&s;t means for their deliverance. He knows all the po&s;&s;ibilities of things, and can &s;o order and over-rule the cour&s;e of events, that tho&s;e things which were de&s;igned for evil, &s;hall be of permanent and la&s;ting advantage. When Jo&s;eph's brethren deprived him of his liberty and &s;old him for a &s;lave, they were influenced merely by an envious, malicious &s;pirit; but it was &s;o over-ruled by God as to be the means of &s;aving them and their's from ruin. Jo&s;eph therefore, &s;ays to his brethren, now therefore be not grieved nor angry with your&s;elves that ye &s;old me hither; for God did &s;end me before you to pre&s;erve life.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xlv. 5.</NOTE> God can ea&s;ily "take the wi&s;e in their own craftine&s;s," and "turn their coun&s;els into fooli&s;hne&s;s." He knows how to make light ari&s;e in the mid&s;t of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="013329_0008_0F904DED9BFC42C8">
darkne&s;s; and can ea&s;ily find out means for the deliverance of his people, when all human wi&s;dom is totally at a non-plus.</P>
<P>THAT God is an omni&s;cient being, is one good rea&s;on why we &s;hould look to him for deliv|erance, under great difficulties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Whatever ability or di&s;po&s;ition any one might have to help us, if he was unacquainted with our circum&s;tances, and the means nece&s;&s;ary for our relief, it would &s;ignify nothing. But &s;ince all our wants are "naked and open before God," and "our &s;ecret groanings are not hid from him," there is good rea&s;on to &s;eek earne&s;tly to him for deliverance from tho&s;e evils to which we are, or may be &s;ubjected. Moreover it is highly fit and nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould &s;eek to God for deliverance from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man, becau&s;e he is an all-powerful being. God hath &s;poken once, (&s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t) twice have I heard this, that power belongeth unto God.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxiii. II. lxxxix, 8, 13.</NOTE> "O Lord God of ho&s;ts, who is a &s;trong Lord like unto thee? Thou ha&s;t a mighty arm, &s;trong is thine hand and high is thy right hand. The hearts of all men are "in the hands of the Lord and he can turn them as the rivers of water are turn|ed;" he can alter their views and purpo&s;es, and cau&s;e that "our enemies &s;hould be at peace with us." The greate&s;t earthly Princes and Potentates are ab&s;olutely &s;ubject to his direction and controul; he can &s;ay unto them, hitherto &s;hall ye come and no further, and here &s;hall your proud waves be &s;tayed. God can with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e, baffle all the de&s;igns that earth or hell can form again&s;t his people. His almighty power has oftentimes been illu&s;|triou&s;ly di&s;played in behalf of his oppre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted people; and he has fully evinc|ed, by the admirable works which he hath
<PB N="11" REF="013329_0009_0F8FFA6411964608">
done, that he is "the Lord God Omnipotent," who ruleth in the kingdoms of men, and "doth according to his will, not only in the armies of heaven, but al&s;o among the inhabitants of the earth." How weak and defencele&s;s &s;oever his people may be, God can ea&s;ily, if he plea&s;es, work out deliverance for them. It may be, &s;ays Jonathan to his armor-bearer, that the Lord will work for us, for there is no re&s;traint to the Lord to &s;ave by many or by few.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I Sam. xiv. 6.</NOTE> He can work deliverance with means or without, ju&s;t as be&s;t comports with his &s;overeign plea&s;ure. If therefore, the eternal God be our refuge, and underneath be the everla&s;ting arms, we need not &s;ear what man can do unto us; for all human power united, is le&s;s than nothing and vanity, when &s;et in competition with the pow|er of God. All human power is derived and limited; whereas the power of God is inherent and ab&s;olute. When Pilate boa&s;ted that he had power, either to crucify or relea&s;e our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, he checked his in&s;olence, by telling him that he could have no power again&s;t him, except it were given him from above.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xix. 10, 11.</NOTE> Tho&s;e who are ve&s;ted with the highe&s;t powers on earth, cannot do any thing without the per|mi&s;&s;ion of God. As therefore God is an omni|potent being, and exerci&s;es an uncontroulable &s;way over all his works, it is highly fit and rea&s;onable that we &s;hould look unto him for deliverance from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man; that we &s;hould cry mightily to God to vindicate our cau&s;e, and to command &s;uccor and deliverance for us. Though the profane and irreligious may &s;coff at, and deride us, and &s;tigmati&s;e us with the opprobrious names of hipocrites and enthu&s;ia&s;ts, becau&s;e we fa&s;t and pray when under oppre&s;&s;ion (as has of late been the practice
<PB N="12" REF="013329_0010_0F8FFA64CC893698">
of &s;ome on the other &s;ide the atlantic) yet let us not cea&s;e to pour out our hearts before God, who is "able to do for us exceeding abund|antly above all we can a&s;k or think."</P>
<P>ANOTHER rea&s;on why we &s;hould &s;eek to God for deliverance from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man, is, becau&s;e he is a merciful and compa&s;&s;ionate being, and is ever di&s;po&s;ed to pity and relieve tho&s;e that are oppre&s;&s;ed. He is "good unto all and his tender mercies are over all the works of his hands," and is ever di&s;po&s;ed by the be|nignity of his nature to promote the welfare and happine&s;s of his creatures. Thou art a God full of compa&s;&s;ion, &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, and gracious, long-&s;uffering and plentious in mer|cy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s; lxxxvi. 15. I&s;. lxiii. 9.</NOTE> He declares, with re&s;pect to his people, that in all their afflictions, he is afflicted. The Lord al&s;o will be a refuge for the oppre&s;&s;ed, a refuge in times of trouble, and they that know thy name &s;hall put their tru&s;t in thee; for thou ha&s;t not for&s;aken them that &s;eek thee. The Lord executeth judgment and righteou&s;|ne&s;s for all that are oppre&s;&s;ed.

<P>THE compa&s;&s;ion of God was wonderfully di&s;|played towards the people of I&s;rael, when op|pre&s;&s;ed and afflicted with the Egyptian bon|dage, and he brought them out "with an high hand, and an out&s;tretched arm" and ut|terly di&s;mayed their enemies.&mdash;This is the language of God with re&s;pect to his afflicted per&s;ecuted people: I have &s;een the affliction of my people which is in Egypt; I have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts vii. 34.</NOTE> We need not recur to ancient times to
<PB N="13" REF="013329_0011_0F8FFA6591101E48">
find proof of the readine&s;s of God to interpo&s;e for the &s;uccor and deliverance of his people. He has at &s;undry times and in divers manners appeared for the people of this, at pre&s;ent di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed land, and has wrought out deliverance for them. When "they were few, yea, very few" and &s;trangers in the land, he appeared in great mercy for them, fought their battles, and "drave out the heathen before them, and gave them this good land for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;" he "bare them as on eagles wings," carried them through innumerable difficulties and hard&s;hips, and "&s;aved them from all that was their fear." When in an arbitrary and de&s;|potic reign they were threatned with the lo&s;s of all tho&s;e precious privileges, which they came into this howling wilderne&s;s peaceably to enjoy, how remarkably did God appear for them, and by introducing a glorious revolution in the nation, &s;ave them from impending ruin! In what a &s;ignal and memorable manner did God appear for this people when a foreign enemy was making a violent de&s;cent upon them, and had arrived at their very borders! How did he &s;catter and de&s;troy them, and cau&s;e the few that &s;urvived the &s;torm and pe&s;tilence to return home a&s;hamed!</P>
<P>NOW God is the &s;ome wi&s;e, powerful and compa&s;&s;ionate being that he ever was. His hand is not &s;hortned that it cannot &s;ave, nor his ear heavy that it cannot hear; nor is he le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to deliver tho&s;e that tru&s;t in him than he ever was. We have therefore, abund|ant rea&s;on to look to him in all our &s;traits and difficulties, and to adopt the prayer of the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>Deliver me from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man.</HI></P>
<P>I PROCEED as was propo&s;ed,</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="013329_0012_0F904DEEF9DDEB48">
2. To point out the temper and di&s;po&s;ition with which we mu&s;t &s;eek to God for deliver|ance from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man, if we would hope to obtain it. Though God is a mo&s;t mer|ciful and compa&s;&s;ionate being; "good and rea|dy to forgive and plentious in mercy to all that call upon him;" yet if we do not &s;eek him in an humble, penitent and obediential manner, there is no probability that we &s;hall find audience and acceptance with him. It is requi&s;ite that we &s;hould eye the hand of God in all tho&s;e difficulties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es in which we are involved: that we be deeply humbled on account of our &s;ins which may have pro|voked him to vi&s;it us with his judgments, and that with un&s;eigned repentance we return unto him from whom we have revolted, and re&s;olve to &s;erve him for the future with great|er diligence and activity. Let us con&s;ider the&s;e things a little particularly.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is nece&s;&s;ary that we eye the hand of God in all tho&s;e difficulties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es that are brought upon us. The pious David con&s;i|dered all the oppre&s;&s;ion and per&s;ecution to which he was &s;ubjected, as being permitted of God. When the impious Shimei came out and cur&s;ed him amid&s;t all his di&s;tre&s;s, he would not &s;uffer vengeance to be executed upon him, but &s;ays, the Lord hath bid him cur&s;e; <HI>i. e.</HI> the Lord permitted him and gave him an oppor|tunity to vent his malice. David did not &s;corn the&s;e cur&s;es, &s;ays one,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Patrick in Loc.</NOTE> as coming from the hand of a vile wretch not worthy to be regard|ed; but acknowleges the ju&s;tice of them, and bears them with &s;ingular patience, out of hu|mility and reverence to God who had &s;o or|dered it. Tho&s;e things are oftentimes &s;aid in
<PB N="15" REF="013329_0013_0F8FFA6683AFEC88">
&s;cripture to be effected by the agency of God, which he permits to be done by others as a puni&s;hment of the &s;ins of particular per&s;ons or of a whole community<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See P&s;. cv. 25. I&s; lxiii 17. Jer. iv. 10. vi. 14.</NOTE> Shall there be evil in the city, &s;ays the prophet, and the Lord hath not done it? I form the light and create darkne&s;s; I make peace and create evil; I the Lord do all the&s;e things.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Amos. iii. 6. I&s;. xlv. 7.</NOTE> The&s;e and &s;uch like expre&s;&s;ions do not indicate that God &s;tirs up and excites men to oppre&s;s and per&s;ecute one another, or to do any thing which is con|trary to the obligations of righteou&s;ne&s;s and mercy: For if they were under a fatal nece&s;|&s;ity of doing the&s;e things, they would not be in the lea&s;t culpable; but God would be the po&s;itive, efficient cau&s;e of &s;in. But the truth is, God leaves men to them&s;elves and permits them, in compliance with their own corrupt pa&s;&s;ions, to oppre&s;s and per&s;ecute others, in or|der to humble them for their &s;ins, or to an&s;|wer &s;ome other important purpo&s;es in the moral government of the world. The per|mi&s;&s;ion of God, does not in the lea&s;t vindicate the conduct of tyrants and oppre&s;&s;ors; but they will be ju&s;tly &s;ubjected to aggravated wrath for tho&s;e very acts of rage and cruelty, which were over-ruled by God for the welfare and happine&s;s of his people. Judas went to his own place, though the horrid deed which he committed operated for the &s;alvation of man|kind. It is &s;aid that Chri&s;t was "crucified and &s;lain by wicked hands," notwith&s;tanding "the determinate coun&s;el and foreknowlege of God." Though we may have ju&s;t rea&s;on to complain of, and condemn the conduct of tho&s;e who injure and oppre&s;s us; yet we mu&s;t ac|knowlege the ju&s;tice of God in permitting, tho&s;e calamities to befall us. This brings me to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="013329_0014_0F904DEFA81AF7C0">
2. THAT we mu&s;t be deeply humbled on account of our &s;ins which may have provoked God to vi&s;it us with his judgments. It is &s;in that &s;eparates between God and his people and hides his face from them that he will not here. All tho&s;e judgments with which men are at any time vi&s;ited, are, no doubt, de&s;igned as a puni&s;hment of their &s;ins. Natural evil in the univer&s;e is the effect of moral. When there|fore, we are oppre&s;&s;ed and afflicted, it is highly fit and nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould humble our|&s;elves under the mighty hand of God&punc; on ac|count of our &s;ins, and that we &s;hould recollect and call to mind what we have done to pro|voke a holy God to come out again&s;t us in his hot di&s;plea&s;ure. If we pre&s;ume to ju&s;tify our|&s;elves before God, and deny that we have de&s;erved his judgments, there is no probability that our prayers will meet with his gracious acceptance. Though the people of this land may, con&s;idered in a comparative view, be a virtuous and religious people; yet, it mu&s;t be acknowleged that iniquity greatly increa&s;es and abounds among us. Our forefathers were eminent for their piety and goodne&s;s, and their zeal for the wor&s;hip of the living and true God: but we are greatly degenerated, and are become a wicked and perver&s;e generation. What im|piety and profanene&s;s, what intemperance and debauchery, what inju&s;tice and cruelty are there prevalent in our land! With what neg|lect and contempt are the word and ordinances of God treated by many! How is family reli|gion gone to decay, and how little care is there taken to in&s;till the principles of virtue and re|ligion into the ri&s;ing generation! How many are there, who, notwith&s;tanding they "pro|fe&s;s to know God and Chri&s;t," yet in works de|ny them; and &s;o bring a great &s;candal upon

Let us carefully examine our own temper and conver&s;ation, to &s;ee how far we in particular have contributed to the pro|voking a holy God to vi&s;it us with his judg|ments. Let us adopt the penitential language of Ezra, and &s;ay each one for him&s;elf, O God, I blu&s;h and am a&s;hamed to lift up my face to thee, my God; for our iniquity is increa&s;ed over our head and our tre&s;pa&s;s is grown up unto the heavens. Though we are in an afflicted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate; yet we mu&s;t acknowlege that God has puni&s;hed us le&s;s than our iniquities de&s;erve. Let us glorify him in the day of vi&s;i|tation and learn obedience by the things we &s;uffer, either as individuals or as a people. By obedience is not meant &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the un|righteous decrees of men; but to the ju&s;t and holy laws of God, who&s;e &s;ervice is mo&s;t plea|&s;ant and &s;atisfactory, and in keeping who&s;e commands there is great reward.</P>

But &s;uch purpo&s;es and re&s;olutions are too apt to be forgotten by us. It is ob&s;erved of God's ancient people, that they forgat God their Sa|viour, who had done great things for them in the land of Egypt. Many times did he deliver them, but they provoked him with their coun&s;el and were brought low for their ini|quity.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. cvi. 21, 43.</NOTE> It mu&s;t be acknowleged that we, as a people, have not taken a &s;uitable notice, nor made a proper improvement of pa&s;t mercies and deliverances.

We have "&s;ang his prai&s;e, and &s;oon forgot his works." This argues great vilene&s;s and ingra|titude; becau&s;e our obligations to love and obedience are enhanced in proportion to the

bli&s;&s;ings which God confers upon us. It is worthy of particular notice here, that the P&s;almi&s;t plainly intimates, that if he was deli|vered from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man, he could much more ea&s;ily keep the precepts of God than while &s;ubject to it. "The oppre&s;&s;ion of man is a great impediment and hindrance to our performing the duties of religion, and takes us off from many opportunities of &s;erving and honoring God. If it does not altogether hinder us from attending upon the duties of religion, yet it tends to di&s;tract our minds, to di&s;compo&s;e our &s;pirits, and hin|der our readine&s;s and chearfulne&s;s in the &s;ervice of God King Solomon has therefore ob&s;erved, that oppre&s;&s;ion will make a wi&s;e man mad.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ecc. vii. 7.</NOTE> It fills men with fiery zeal and indig|nation, &s;o that they are in a manner tran&s;|ported beyond them&s;elves; e&s;pecially when ba&s;e indignities are put upon them, and they are treated with all manner of in&s;olence and contempt! Oppre&s;&s;ion has a mo&s;t pernicious in|fluence upon religion, as it takes off our atten|tion from the important concerns of it; as it excites our angry pa&s;&s;ions, occa&s;ions unchri&s;ti|an heats and animo&s;ities, de&s;troys brotherly love, and even common friend&s;hip and good agreement, and as it contracts the &s;phere of our u&s;efulne&s;s in the world. The P&s;almi&s;t therefore might &s;afely engage, that if he was delivered from the oppre&s;&s;ion of man, he would keep God's precepts. He would have much better ability and greater opportunity for it. Let us endeavor to imitate him in this pious re&s;olution, and while we &s;eek deliver|ance, &s;olemnly engage that we will endeavor

to love God more inten&s;ly and to &s;erve him with greater diligence and fidelity than ever before.</P>
<P>THUS we have con&s;idered the &s;everal things at fir&s;t propo&s;ed, and nothing now re|mains, but that we apply the&s;e truths to our own particular circum&s;tances. It is too evi|dent to be denied, that we are a people un|der the oppre&s;&s;ion of man. The heavy hand of power is lifted up again&s;t us, and we are in a very afflicted, per&s;ecuted condition. The government in the mother country &s;eems greatly incen&s;ed again&s;t the people of this pro|vince in a particular manner; and if we were to judge by &s;ome late decrees of the Briti&s;h &s;e|nate, it &s;eems as if they were determined to exterminate the very idea of freedom from among this people. It mu&s;t be owned that many things have been &s;aid and done among us very in&s;olent and abu&s;ive, and which, it were &s;incerely to be wi&s;hed, had been left un|done. We have not behaved our&s;elves &s;o wi&s;e|ly and prudently as we might and ought to have done but too many have improved their liberty as a cloak for licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT what was it that rai&s;ed &s;uch a di&s;order|ly and ungovernable &s;pirit among this people, but acts and decrees which were judged in|con&s;i&s;tent with "that liberty where with we were made free." There was not a more peace|able people upon the face of the earth, than the inhabitants of the&s;e American colonies, be|fore laws were made on the other &s;ide the water to impo&s;e uncon&s;titutional taxes, and violently extort our property from us. Before this, a mo&s;t happy harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the mother country and the colonies: they
<PB N="23" REF="013329_0021_0F8FFA6A891729E8">
delighted in mutual good offices and "&s;ought the things that made for peace." We rejoic|ed in the friend&s;hip and protection of the parent &s;tate, and gloried in the welfare of the land of our forefather's &s;epulchres. But ala&s;s! the&s;e halcyon days are pa&s;t, and it is que&s;tion|able whether we &s;hall live to &s;ee them return. A foundation &s;eems to be laid for a long and violent &s;truggle which threatens the ruin of both countries. The people in this land being the de&s;cendants of ance&s;tors who fled from their native country, to e&s;cape the cruel hand of per&s;ecution, have a high &s;en&s;e of liberty and freedom, and any "yoke of bon|dage" is peculiarly galling to them. Every inva&s;ion of their rights brings to mind the horrid cruelty and barbarity which was exer|ci&s;ed upon our forefathers, and which finally drove them to take up their re&s;idence in this howling wilderne&s;s; thinking them&s;elves &s;afer among &s;avage bea&s;ts, and yet more &s;avage men than among their kindred according to the fle&s;h. As they underwent every kind of diffi|culty and hard&s;hip, in order that they might peaceably enjoy civil and religious liberty, and tran&s;mit the &s;ame as an invaluable inheritance to their po&s;terity, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that we &s;hall very readily &s;ubmit to arbitrary and de&s;|potic power. It is &s;trongly to be &s;u&s;pected, that whoever concerted the late violent and coercive mea&s;ures, is not only an enemy to the liberties of America, but al&s;o to the welfare of the nation. The intere&s;ts of the two countries are in&s;eparably connected: the &s;ame weapon that &s;tabs America, pierces the vitals of Britain. Had not the loyal &s;ubjects of our mo&s;t gracious &s;overeign in this province been greatly traduc|ed

and vilified, and their de&s;igns mo&s;t &s;hock|ingly mi&s;repre&s;ented, it is not &s;uppo&s;eable that he, who &s;tiles him&s;elf the father of his people, would have granted his royal a&s;&s;ent to &s;ome late acts which mu&s;t mo&s;t deeply di&s;tre&s;s many of his innocent &s;ubjects. But however it may have come to pa&s;s, the three branches of the legi&s;|lature &s;eem to be united again&s;t us: and the few friends we have to plead our cau&s;e are utterly un&s;ucce&s;sful in their mo&s;t vigorous at|tempts to pre&s;erve our con&s;titutional rights. The capital of this province is inve&s;ted in a ho&s;tile manner, without the inhabitants being indulged an opportunity to vindicate them|&s;elves, or to make &s;atisfaction for injuries &s;u&s;|tained by individuals. Thou&s;ands of inno|cent per&s;ons are at one &s;troke deprived of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and left to peri&s;h with hunger, if not relieved by the charity of their friends. The widow and the fatherle&s;s, the aged and infirm, and the tender helple&s;s in|fant are alike involved in one common cala|mity. If this be not oppre&s;&s;ion and per&s;ecu|tion, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what is. This is a decree not to be parralleled in the hi&s;tory of any free people; if it was ever equalled among the mo&s;t barbarous nations. It is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak freely; if we were to be &s;ilent at &s;uch a &s;ea|&s;on as this, there would be rea&s;on to expect that the very "&s;tones in the &s;treet would cry out." And as if this &s;evere and mercile&s;s edict were not &s;ufficient, behold! &s;everal others are pa&s;&s;ed, levelled not again&s;t a particular town, but again&s;t this whole province. Our mo&s;t valuable charter rights are wre&s;ted from us without our being offered an opportunity to make any defence; and the King's repre|&s;entative
<PB N="25" REF="013329_0023_0F8FFA6BA9C7FFC8">
is ve&s;ted with very extraordinary powers, utterly unknown before, either in Bri|tain or America. And in order to put in exe|cution the&s;e decrees, a fleet and army are &s;ent among us that all re&s;i&s;tance may be effectual|ly prevented.</P>
<P>Now can we con&s;ider the&s;e things and not be convinced that we are under the oppre&s;&s;ion of man: can we help trembling for fear that our precious rights and privileges will at length be all extorted from us, and that we &s;hall be reduced to a &s;tate of abject &s;lavery? Can we help trembling for the ark of God, the intere&s;t of religion, at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on as this is? Our civil and religious privileges are clo&s;ely and in&s;eparably connected; if we give up the form|er we cannot expect long to enjoy the latter.

"It is better to tru&s;t in the Lord than to put confidence in man; it is better to tru&s;t in the Lord than to put confidence in Princes." Let us then in an humble, penitent, obedi|ential manner, depend upon "the Lord Je|hovah, with whom is everla&s;ting &s;trength," for help and &s;afety. Though we have been a &s;inful and ungrateful people, yet &s;uch is the goodne&s;s and mercy of God, that there is great rea&s;on to hope that he will in &s;ome way or other appear for us, and defeat the de&s;igns of tho&s;e who &s;eem to be inimical to us.

In attempting to cru&s;h one province, exclu&s;ive of the re&s;t, they, no doubt, &s;uppo&s;ed, that the others would re&s;t ea&s;y, apprehending that their own commerce might be increa&s;ed and their particular in|tere&s;t advanced: but behold! how the wi&s;e are taken in their own craftine&s;s. The very mea&s;ure which was probably de&s;igned to pre|vent a union, is like to produce a mo&s;t firm, and we tru&s;t indi&s;&s;oluble one.

But it would be pre&s;umption in us to pretend exactly to determine what the de|&s;igns of God's providence are: this however we know, that he has promi&s;ed that "all things &s;hall work for good to them that love him." If we are a humble, penitent, obedient people, he will not leave nor for&s;ake us; but will be "our refuge and &s;trength, a very pre|&s;ent help in trouble." He will cau&s;e us "to know the way in which we &s;hould walk," and will order every thing in great mercy to us.&mdash;Let us be deeply humbled before God on ac|count of our &s;ins, which are the procuring cau&s;es of our &s;ufferings; and earne&s;tly entreat the "father of lights" to pour out upon this people a &s;pirit of grace and &s;upplication, of repentance and reformation. Let us &s;incere|ly endeavor to turn every one from his evil way unto the living and true God; and while his judgments are in the earth, let us learn righteou&s;ne&s;s. God is now loudly calling upon us to "break off our &s;ins by righteou&s;ne&s;s and our iniquities by turning to the Lord."

We are bound to u&s;e our utmo&s;t endeavors to defend them, not only on our own account, but for the &s;ake of our po&s;terity, who are dear to us as our&s;elves. Future generations are really more deeply intere&s;ted in our conduct in this matter than we are our&s;elves. The gla&s;s of life with re&s;pect to many of us is almo&s;t run, and we &s;hall &s;oon take our flight into the world of &s;pirits, where "the &s;ervant is free from his ma&s;ter" and the "voice of the oppre&s;&s;or will be heard no more." And it is certain, that rather than be ab&s;olutely &s;ubject to the will of others, a wi&s;e man would chu&s;e to be "free

It be|comes us all therefore, to behave with great wi&s;dom, prudence, and firmne&s;s, and to en|deavor as much as po&s;&s;ible to be united in tho&s;e mea&s;ures which are mo&s;t likely to pro|mote the general good. It is very unhappy for us that there is &s;o much divi&s;ion and ani|mo&s;ity among us at this critical juncture. If all parties would exerci&s;e chri&s;tian candor and conde&s;cention, it mu&s;t be of eminent ad|vantage. Let us not imagine, becau&s;e we have this day pre&s;ented our&s;elves before the Lord, and implored his gracious &s;uccor and deliverance in our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that there is nothing more to be done: but let us remember that we mu&s;t be daily &s;eeking to God. Every family apart, and every &s;oul apart, mu&s;t cry mightily to God in &s;uch a di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing &s;ea&s;on as this is. Call upon me, &s;ays he, in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and glorify thou me.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;. 1. 15.</NOTE> Let us humble our&s;elves more and more "under the mighty hand of God," and endeavor to walk more clo&s;ely with him. Let us tru&s;t in him in a way of duty for deliverance from tho&s;e cala|mities we feel, and for the prevention of tho&s;e we fear. Whatever hard&s;hips and &s;ufferings we may be &s;ubjected to, let us never murmur nor repine at the hand of God, but glorify him in the day of vi&s;itation. Let us wait his time to interpo&s;e in our behalf, who knows infinitely better than we do what is for our be|nefit and advantage. Let us thankfully improve

<P>AND now unto him who is the only Poten|tate, the King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords; who is able and ready to do for us exceeding abundantly above all we can a&s;k or think, to the only wi&s;e God and our Saviour, be glory, honor, dominion and power, for ever and ever. AMEN.</P>
