<P>CHRIST our Lord, to whom every knee mu&s;t bow, and every tongue confe&s;s, either in mercy or in judgment, came down from his father's glory, took up|on him our nature and &s;uffered death for us, to re&s;tore to us that fir&s;t life of meekne&s;s, purity and love, that being dead to &s;in, we &s;hould live unto righteou&s;ne&s;s. Leaving us an example, &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, that we &s;hould follow his &s;teps. He po&s;itively enjoins us, to love our enemies, to ble&s;s them that cur&s;e us; to do good to tho&s;e that hate us, and pray for them which de&s;pitefully u&s;e us and per&s;ecute us. A new command|ment, &s;aith our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, I give unto you, that ye love one another as I have loved you. The meek, the merciful and the pure in heart are by him pronounced to be the particular objects of divine re|gard. The&s;e are the watch words of Chri&s;tianity to all the true followers of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>On the other hand, War requires of its votaries that they kill, de&s;troy, lay wa&s;te, and to the utmo&s;t of their power di&s;tre&s;s and annoy, and in every way and manner deprive tho&s;e they e&s;teem their enemies of &s;upport and comfort. Now reader, con&s;ider the dif|ference; look at the &s;uffering and di&s;tre&s;s which has, and continues to de&s;olate this once highly favoured land; numbers of human beings, equally with our &s;elves the objects of redeeming grace, are daily hurried into eternity, many, its to be feared, in an unprepared &s;tate; and if upon comparing the one with the other we feel compunction, if we are moved with compa&s;&s;ion toward our fellow-men, let us cheri&s;h this &s;en&s;ation; it is a call from the God of Love, the beneficent father of mankind, whom the Apo&s;tle de|nominates, under the appellation of love. God is Love&mdash;and he that dwelleth in God dwelleth in love and God in him.</P>

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON THE NATURE of WAR, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WAR, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, is the pre|meditated and determined de&s;tructi|on of human beings, of creatures originally <HI>formed after the image of God,</HI> and who&s;e pre|&s;ervation, for that rea&s;on, is &s;ecured by hea|ven it&s;elf within the &s;ence of this righteous law, that <HI>at the hand of every man's brother, the life of man &s;hall be required.</HI> And though this created image of our holy God mu&s;t be owned to have been &s;o wretchedly defaced, as to retain but a very faint re&s;emblance of its divine original; yet as the highe&s;t enforce|ment of that heavenly law, which was pub|li&s;hed for the &s;ecurity of life, it is mo&s;t gra|ciou&s;ly renewed by the incarnation of the &s;on of God, and the indwelling of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle James, <HI>chap.</HI> 4th, hath an&s;wer|ed the que&s;tion with re&s;pect to the cau&s;e of war, in &s;o preci&s;e and determinate a manner as to preclude all difficulty and doubt about it; <HI>from whence comes wars and fighting among&s;t you,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>come they not hence, even of your

lu&s;ts, that war in your members: Ye kill and de&s;ire to have, and cannot obtain: Ye fight and war, yet have not, becau&s;e ye a&s;k ami&s;s,</HI> becau&s;e ye have no re&s;pect to the will of <HI>the Lord that reigneth,</HI> but for&s;aking the <HI>Supreme Good</HI> in whom alone your happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, ye fol|low an earthly and deceitful good and think only of procuring it by your power. James iv, 3. <HI>Ye a&s;k and receive not, becau&s;e ye a&s;k ami&s;s,</HI> from a &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;pect to <HI>the Lord that reigneth,</HI> but, too generally, for animal and &s;en&s;ual enjoyment, <HI>that ye may con&s;ume it upon your lu&s;ts.</HI> In this very explicit and true ac|count, war, like all other evils, is de&s;cribed as centering in it&s;elf; and the end of it is declared to be gratification of tho&s;e very ap|petites and pa&s;&s;ions, from which it derives its birth; for in this unhappy circle, which is indeed the great circle of the hi&s;tory of man, the fatal mi&s;chief proceeds. <HI>War is the in&s;e|parable union between the &s;en&s;ual and malignant pa&s;&s;ions; war protracted to a certain period, ne|ce&s;&s;arily compels peace; peace revives and extends trade and commerce; trade and commerce give new life, vigour, and &s;cope to the &s;en&s;ual and ma|lignant pa&s;&s;ions, and the&s;e naturally tend to gene|rate another war.</HI></P>
<P>The di&s;orders of nature and of life are wholly the effects of &s;in, of a voluntary aver|&s;ion and alienation from the life, light and love of God; in perfect union, with which perfect peace and happine&s;s are only to be found; hence that di&s;cordance of the out|ward

elements, which brings forth pe&s;tilence, famine, earthquakes, &s;torms,,and tempe&s;ts; hence, in the corporal part of the human frame, pain, &s;ickne&s;s, and death; in the mental, &s;en&s;uality, pride, and malignity, in|cluding all the &s;elfi&s;h and wrathful pa&s;&s;ions, that between individuals, engender envy, ha|tred, injury, re&s;entment, and revenge; and between nations, a peculiar kind of enmity and wrong, that i&s;&s;ues in war. Surrounded with evil as men are, and full of evil them|&s;elves, what would become of the whole wretched race, at any given in&s;tant of time, at this very moment for example, if the ef|fect of that evil were not continually &s;u&s;pend|ed, and directed by infinite power; &s;o as to become continually &s;ub&s;ervient to the pur|po&s;es of infinite wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and love.</P>
<P>It would be needle&s;s to mention the nature of that univer&s;al redemption which is pro|po&s;ed by the go&s;pel; if in this age of levity we were not &s;o apt to forget it. It is, in general, a full re&s;toration of the life of God in the &s;oul; the life of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, which was once the life and perfection of fallen man, which the Son of God, the brui&s;er of the &s;erpent, has by his &s;uffering, been re&s;toring, to human nature from the time in which Adam fell.</P>
<P>When the Son of God became incarnate, what was implied in this re&s;toration as the effect of its influence upon man, was fully
<PB N="6" REF="015737_0006_0F9A231CEED0AA38">
evident from our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's doctrine and his life; namely, the conque&s;t and re|nunciation of the world, the death of the will, and of all the appetites and pa&s;&s;ions of fallen animal nature, through faith in his name&mdash;not an hi&s;torical and &s;peculative faith, a mere rational a&s;&s;ent to the truth of a well atte&s;ted hi&s;tory of facts and doctrines; but a full, ardent, continual de&s;ire of the <HI>life of Chri&s;t,</HI> as begotten and formed in the &s;oul, by the continual operation of the Holy Gho&s;t. Thus what was at fir&s;t the per&s;onal duties of &s;ingle christians, when they were &s;cattered over the face of the earth, and were only parts of different nations, became afterwards national duties, when whole nati|ons became chri&s;tians. If, therefore, <HI>to love our enemy, to forgive him, to do him good, and pray for him;</HI> it to <HI>overcome the world,</HI> who&s;e power con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life,</HI> are chri&s;tian per&s;onal duties, if to <HI>love the Lord our God, with all our heart, with all our soul, with all our mind, and with all our &s;trength, and our fellow-creatures as our&s;elves,</HI> is the purity and perfection of the chri&s;tian per&s;onal life, the &s;ame mu&s;t al&s;o be true of a chri&s;tian national duty; for a chri&s;tian nation differs no other|wi&s;e from a chri&s;tian person, than as the whole differs from one of the parts of which it e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>It would be needle&s;s to propo&s;e this &s;ub|ject to the con&s;ideration of experimental

That property is confounded, &s;cattered, and de&s;troyed; that laws are trampled under foot, government de&s;pi&s;ed, and the ties of all civil and dome&s;tic order broken into pieces; that fruitful countries are made de&s;arts, and &s;tately cities a heap of ruins, that matrons and virgins are violated; and neither the in|nocence of unoffending infancy, nor the im|potence of decrepit age, afford protection from the rage and thir&s;t for blood; this is but the mortal progeny of this &s;eeming womb|of mi&s;chief; the wor&s;t, even the dreadful effect it has upon the immortal &s;oul, is &s;till behind; and tho' remote from tho&s;e &s;en&s;es and pa&s;&s;ions that are exerci&s;ed only by pre|&s;ent good and evil, mu&s;t yet, upon the lea&s;t recollection, impre&s;s with horror every mind that believes there is a righteous God, and a &s;tate of retribution, that is to la&s;t forever.

<P>About the Year I749; I failed from Liverpool to the coa&s;t of Guinea, &s;ometime after our arrival, I was ordered to go up the country a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, upon having notice from one of the Negro Kings, that he had a parcel of Slaves to di&s;po&s;e of, I received my in&s;tructions and went carrying with me an account of &s;uch goods we had on board, to exchange for the Slaves we intended to purcha&s;e; upon being intro|duced, I pre&s;ented him with a &s;mall ca&s;e of Spirits, a Gun, and &s;ome tri&s;les, which having accepted, and under&s;tood by an interpreter what goods we had, the next day was appointed for viewing the Slaves; we found about two hundred confined in one place. But here how &s;hall I relate the affecting &s;ight I there be|held, the &s;ilent &s;orrow which appeared in the coun|tenance of the afflicted father, and the painful angui&s;h of the tender mother, expecting to be forever &s;eparated from their tender offspring; the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed maid wring|ing her hands in pre&s;age of her future wretchedne&s;s, and the general cry of the innocent, from a fearful apprehen&s;ion of the perpetual &s;lavery to which they were doomed.

We had not been a fortnight at Sea, before the fatal con&s;equence of this de&s;pair appeared, they formed a de&s;ign of recovering their natural right, liberty, by rai&s;ing and murdering every man on board; but the goodne&s;s of the Almighty ren|dered their &s;cheme abortive and his mercy &s;pared us to have time to repent: The plot was di&s;covered; the ringleader tied by the two thumbs over the barricado door, at Sun-ri&s;e received a number of la&s;hes, in this &s;ituation he remain till Sun &s;et, expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults and barbarity of the brutal crew of Sailors with full leave to exerci&s;e their cruelty at plea&s;ure: The eon&s;e|quence was, that next morning the mi&s;erable &s;ufferer was found dead, flead from the &s;houlders to the wai&s;t.

<P>Doctor Cheyne, in his E&s;&s;ay of health and long life, &s;ays. "All people, who have any regard to their health and lives, ought to tremble at the fir&s;t cravings for &s;uch poi&s;onous liquors.

<P>It is pretended. that drams comfort, warm, and de|fend from the &s;everity of weather, to which men are &s;ometimes expo&s;ed; without which they &s;ay, they &s;hould peri&s;h with cold; which is probably, in a great mea&s;ure, true of tho&s;e who are habituated to drink them; the blood of &s;uch being thereby &s;o much im|poveri&s;hed, that it is well known many of the drinkers of drams are cold and lifele&s;s in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, without frequent repetitions; this is what &s;ome of them have owned. But on the other hand, how much more able are &s;ober per&s;ons to endure cold and hard&s;hips; their vital heat not being extingui&s;hed by intemperance, does by its kindly genial warmth, more effectually &s;ecure them from the inclemency of the weather, than the fal&s;e fla&s;h of a dram. Be&s;ides, it is well known, that men did not peri&s;h in the colde&s;t countries for want of drams formerly, when they were not to be had, of the undoubted truth of this, Cap|tain Ellis gives a full proof in the account of his voyage to Hud&s;on's bay, page I99: Where he ob|&s;erves, "That the natives of the very cold coa&s;t of

In &s;upport of this opinion, we are frequently told of the many people who have died at tho&s;e times through the extream heat and fatigue, and it is &s;up|po&s;ed that many more would die, if a plentiful u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors was not allowed, but this is a mi&s;|taken notion. it being much more likely that the free u&s;e of rum occa&s;ioned the death of tho&s;e people, the quantity they had &s;wallowed down, &s;ending a great flow of &s;pirits into the head in proportion to the &s;trength of their body cau&s;ed them to &s;train their &s;trength beyond what nature could bear; and in gene|ral the repeated large quantities of &s;pirit commonly drank during the whole time of harve&s;t, keeps up the blood in &s;o continual a ferment and fever, that people cannot have a proper re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">torative &s;leep; their con&s;titu|tions are thereby enervated their lives &s;hortned and an unfitne&s;s for religious impre&s;&s;ions generally prevails.</P>

If &s;uch labour was carried on with &s;teadine&s;s and proper moderation, there would cer|tainly be no need of a recruit of &s;trength being fought for by that means; more frequent intervals of re&s;t with a little food oftener allowed the reapers, and &s;mall drinks, &s;uch as mola&s;&s;es and water, either alone or made more agreable with a little cyder, &s;mall beer, or even milk and water would fully enable them to perform their work to their employer's &s;atisfaction and their own advantage, and the overplus wages they would receive to the value of the &s;pirits u&s;ually given them, might be &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e bread for their families.

Dr. Cheyne ob&s;erves, that without all doubt, water is the primitive original beverage, as it is the only &s;imple fluid &s;itted for diluting, moi&s;tening and cooling; the ends of drink, appointed by nature, and he adds happy had it been for the race of mankind, if other mixed and artificial liquors had never been invented. Water alone is &s;u&s;ficient and effectual for all the purpo&s;es of human want in drink: Strong liquors were never de|&s;igned for common u&s;e. Speaking of the effect of wine, which he &s;ays to have been &s;o much in u&s;e at the time he wrote, that the better fort of people &s;carcely diluted their food with any other liquor, he remarks, <Q>That as natural cau&s;es will always produce their proper effects, their blood was inflamed into gout, &s;tone, and rheumati&s;m, raging fevers, pleurifies, &amp;c.

<P>Doctor Short, in his di&s;coor&s;e of the inward u&s;e of water, &s;peaks much in its commendation. He &s;ays, we can draw a very convincing argument of the excellency of water, from the longevity and healthfulne&s;s of tho&s;e who at fir&s;t had no better liquor, and the health and &s;trength of body and &s;erenty of mind, of the&s;e who at this day have no other common liquor to drink, of this the common people among&s;t the High|lands of Scotland, are a &s;ufficient in&s;tance, among&s;t whom it is no rarity to find per&s;ons of eighty, ninety, yea an hundred years of age, as healthy &s;trong and nimble, as wine or ale bibbers are at thirty &s;ix or forty. The Doctor &s;ays, There is a ridiculous maxim u&s;ed by drinkers, that water makes but thin blood, not &s;it for bu&s;ine&s;s. I &s;ay, &s;ays he, it is water only that can enduce its drinkers with the &s;tronge&s;t bodies and mo&s;t robu&s;t con&s;titutions, where exerci&s;e or labour is joined with it, &s;ince it bell a&s;&s;its the &s;tomach and lungs to reduce the aliments into the &s;malle&s;t particles, that

In this we are confirmed, if we con&s;ider the great &s;trength and hardine&s;s of poor ru&s;ticks in many parts of the world, whole provisions is mo&s;tly vegetable food, and their drink water. The doctor adds, that it often happens that per&s;ons of tender, weakly, crazy con&s;titutions, by ref|raining from &s;trong liquors and accu&s;toming them&s;elves to drink water, make a &s;hift to &s;pin out many years.</P>
<P>After de&s;cribing the many di&s;tempers produced by drinking malt or other &s;ermented liquors he adds, that &s;eeing con&s;titutions differ, it is not to be expected that &s;pirituous liquors &s;hould produce all the &s;ame &s;ymp|toms in one and the &s;ame per&s;on, yet that all drinkers have &s;everal of them; and if they come not to that height, its becau&s;e they afterwards u&s;e great exerci&s;e or hard labour, with &s;ometimes thin diluting liquors, which prevent their immediate hurting.</P>
<P>And with re&s;pect to &s;uch well di&s;po&s;ed people, who &s;till retain a favourable opinion of the u&s;e of &s;pirits mixed with water, ought they not, even from a love to man|kind, to endeavour to refrain from it, on account of the effect their example may have in incouraging others in the u&s;e of &s;pirituous, liquors, agreable to the example left us by the apo&s;tle Paul, I Cor.

<P>A very eminent phy&s;ician has given the following di|rection, for the benefit of tho&s;e who have not wi&s;dom enough left at once to abandon the odious and pernici|ous practice of drinking di&s;tilled &s;pirituous liquors, viz. By degrees to mix water with the &s;pirit, to le&s;&s;en the quantity every day, and keep to the &s;ame quantity of water, till in about the cour&s;e of a week, nothing of the dram kind be u&s;ed along with water. By this means the per&s;on will &s;uffer no inconveniency, but reap great benefit upon leaving off drams or &s;pirits as has been tried by many. If any gnawing be left in the &s;tomach upon quite leaving it off, a little warm broth, weak tea, or any thing of that kind, will be a &s;ervice. The ap|petite always increa&s;es in a few days after leaving off drams, unle&s;s by the too long continuance of them, the tone of the &s;tomach is de&s;troyed. And when the &s;tomach is thus affected a cup of carduus, camomile tea, wormwood or centaury every morning fa&s;ting and every evening will be found a good remedy.</P>
