<HEAD>TO Doctor <HI>Zabdiel Boyl&s;ton.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_SO great is your Practice both in Town and Country, and &s;uch is your Care and Tho't of your Pa|tients, that I believe you have hard|ly any time to Read D&mdash;s' <HI>Di&s;&s;er|tation of the</HI> Inoculation <HI>of the</HI> Small-Pox: You will therefore take it not ami&s;s, if I &s;ave you the labour of reading that injudicious Piece, by giving you this Evening &s;ome Stric|tures upon it.</P>
<P>IT &s;urprized me to find one, who is reputed a Scholar, and values him&s;elf upon a Degree which he little de&s;erves, committing &s;everal manife&s;t <HI>Grammatical Blunders</HI> in a Sheet or two: And yet if he had re&s;erved them all for the <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation,</HI> I &s;hould have forgiven them; but I can by no means excu&s;e <HI>any one in a De|dication</HI>: Methinks he might, in honour to his Degree and Character, have afforded good Mr. JEKYLL his Patron good &s;en&s;e for a Quarter of a Sheet without any Error at all; but it
<PB N="2" REF="003296_0003_0FF03EBCEAC58620">&s;eems he has not; whether it proceeded from an unhappy Ignorance, or a noble Negligence one may ea&s;ily conjecture: <HI>To &s;peak in Medical</HI> Terms, &s;ays he, <HI>Integrity &s;eems to be in the</HI> Con|&s;titution <HI>of your Family.</HI> He may call you <HI>a Quack,</HI> if he plea&s;es; but I am &s;ure he is a <HI>Blunderbu&s;s</HI> to make <HI>the Con&s;titution</HI> of Mr. JE|KYL's Family <HI>Medical Terms.</HI> And by the way, here, he &s;eems to me to be as much out in point of <HI>Decency,</HI> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n <HI>Grammar</HI>: For I cannot but think it a great, invidious and inexcu&s;able Neg|lect in him, when he mentions Mr. JEKYL's Family and its <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> and applauds his <HI>Uncle,</HI> to overlook his Reverend <HI>Father,</HI> who was an Eminent Clergyman, and as I have been inform'd from undoubted Authorities, was highly e&s;teemed for his <HI>Probity, Integrity</HI> and many more Virtues.</P>
<P>THERE are one or two con&s;iderable Errors more of his in the <HI>Dedication,</HI> and diver&s;e <HI>gro&s;s</HI> ones in the <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation</HI>; but I &s;hall not &s;tay to expo&s;e them; le&s;t You, and others, &s;hould think I regard his <HI>Words</HI> more than his <HI>Meaning</HI> and his <HI>Sounds</HI> rather than his <HI>Sen&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE I come to what immediately relates to the Controver&s;y <HI>concerning Inoculation</HI>; I mu&s;t inform You, that our Author &s;ays in his Dedi|cation, <HI>With out Pa&s;&s;ion or Prejudice &mdash; I &s;hall impartially relate the Hi&s;tory,</HI> &amp;c. But, notwith|&s;tanding this good Promi&s;e, in his Book he &s;hews his old <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion &amp; Prejudice</HI> again&s;t You, &amp; your excellent Friend the late Doctor MATHER.</P>
<P>IN pag. 10. he &s;ays, he <HI>can &s;eldome have recour&s;e to</HI> your <HI>Accounts</HI>; I expected his Rea&s;on would
<PB N="3" REF="003296_0004_0FF03EBF34FC50D8">be, becau&s;e they were &s;carce here when he wrote his Di&s;&s;ertation; but his Rea&s;on is, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> (as he &s;ays) <HI>of their being &s;o jejune, lame, &s;u&s;pected, and only in the nature of a Quack Bill.</HI> If this be a good Rea&s;on; many, and I in particular, <HI>can &s;eldom have recour&s;e</HI> to his in&s;ipid Pamplet: For many things are <HI>jejune and lame</HI> in it, I <HI>&s;u&s;pect</HI> &s;everal things, and I verily believe any <HI>Quack</HI> in <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> would, with the A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance he has had, produce as good a Perfor|mance. And as for your part, you need not regard his Character of <HI>your Account</HI> of Inocu|lation here, when it has been approved by Dr. JURIN the late Secretary of the Royal Society, and many other Per&s;ons of Learning and Fi|gure; and when (notwith&s;tanding he calls your <HI>Dedication</HI> of it to the Prince&s;s of WALES <HI>a&s;&s;uming</HI>) it met with a kinder Reception from her Royal Highne&s;s, and a more favourable Entertainment from all the wi&s;e and impartial, than his <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation</HI> ever ought to or will have a|mong Men of Under&s;tanding, or his <HI>Dedication</HI> from his Patron. And &s;o much concerning your Book.</P>
<P>AS to you your &s;elf he tells us, that when your <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s ran low</HI> here, you went for LON|DON, <HI>and expected under the Character of an</HI> ex|perienced Inoculator, <HI>a profitable Encouragement there, but was entirely di&s;appointed,</HI> pag. 7. This is an idle &s;urmi&s;e, and great Untruth of his; for you went not to LONDON under that Cha|racter he tells of; nor, as you have informed me, would you inoculate there; tho' you were <HI>often</HI> pre&s;&s;ed and encouraged to it.</P>
<P>BUT he is not content with a rude U&s;age of
<PB N="4" REF="003296_0005_0FF03EC0B89EA8D0">you in his <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation</HI>; He mu&s;t al&s;o tell his Patron, that you are a Man of <HI>no Literature and habitual Ra&s;hne&s;s.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I took upon you to be as well acquainted with your Bu&s;ine&s;s as the <HI>Graduated Doctor</HI>: You &s;eem, from what I can learn, as well as he, to un|der&s;tand <HI>the Theory of Di&s;ea&s;es</HI>; and as to the <HI>Curing</HI> of them, I believe every Practitioner in <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> at BOSTON will give you the Preference. Nor do I think any of them will blame you for <HI>the habitual Ra&s;hne&s;s,</HI> which he charges you with, &s;o much as they do and will him for his <HI>actual Ra&s;hne&s;s</HI> in many In&s;tances, but e&s;pecial|ly with Regard to his Excellency our late Gover|nour.&mdash; <HI>Nec te, improbe, Saltem&mdash;Terruit Exempl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Phaeton. I have now done with you, Doctor, but not with <HI>D&mdash;s</HI>; nor &s;hall I, on his Account, leave off my Letter this good while.</P>
<P><HI>D&mdash;s</HI> has but <HI>few words and &s;piteful</HI> of Dr. MATHER; but it had been better for him to have &s;aid nothing at all than to traduce and le&s;&s;en the Character of that great Man: He might well think every good Man would con|temn every <HI>di&s;graceful word</HI> given out concerning that Pious &amp; Learned Gentleman, &amp; at the &s;ame time abhor <HI>the Per&s;on</HI> who &s;peaks or writes it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not dwell on his &s;aying the Doctor had TIMONIUS' and PYLARINUS's Accounts <HI>&s;ur|reptiou&s;ly,</HI> which is a paltry word, and has an ill &s;ound. What does the Blade mean by it? Would he make us believe the Doctor <HI>Stole</HI> the Book from &s;ome-body he lent it to, that &s;o he might have <HI>the Honour of the new fangled Noti|tion,</HI> p. 2. Yes, &s;o his words plainly import:
<PB N="5" REF="003296_0006_0FF03EC403558BD0">But &s;uch an In&s;inuation, (be&s;ides the <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> he betrays in it; ina&s;much as he (imagining the afore&s;aid Accounts, publi&s;hed to the World to be his <HI>private Property)</HI> &s;uppo&s;es no one, but <HI>he,</HI> had any Right to know the Purport of them) it conveys al&s;o in it a <HI>notorious Fal&s;ity</HI>; and therefore tends to the Di&s;grace of the <HI>Accu&s;er,</HI> and is no Di&s;paragement to the <HI>Decea&s;ed.</HI>&mdash;When the Doctor was alive, he tho't it a <HI>Prai&s;e and an Honour</HI> to be <HI>Di&s;honour|ed</HI> and in&s;ulted by &s;uch Mi&s;creants as <HI>D&mdash;s</HI>: and if he be <HI>maletreated</HI> now by &s;uch, it is &s;till a Glory to him.</P>
<P>BUT I can by no means put up his 8th page: In that he &s;ays, <HI>The be&s;t of men have &s;ome Foible, and that of Dr.</HI> MATHER'<HI>s was</HI> Credulity. How natural is it to retort here, that <HI>the wor&s;t of men</HI> have <HI>many Foibles</HI>; and tho&s;e of Dr. <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> &s;eem to be <HI>Incredulity, Malice and Ill-nature.</HI> But &s;uppo&s;e one &s;hould deny <HI>Credulity</HI> to be the Doctor's <HI>Foible</HI>; the In&s;tances he has bro't to prove it, in the afore&s;aid Page, will never do it: For &s;everal of the Matters of Fact there|in are indi&s;putably true, as there are many in BOSTON who can te&s;tify. <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> indeed &s;ays, <HI>that allowing &s;uch bold A&s;&s;ertions without di&s;proving them, would be leading Mankind into a Snare.</HI> Why then did not he, fir&s;t of all, <HI>di&s;prove</HI> 'em, and then advi&s;e Mankind, as thoughtle&s;s Birds, to avoid <HI>the Snare</HI>? Surely he was unwi&s;e that he did not at large demon&s;trate, that when Dr. MATHER &s;aid he <HI>never knew</HI> Bli&s;tering <HI>mi&s;s of &s;aving Life in the Small Pox,</HI> &amp;c. He did <HI>know</HI> that it had <HI>mi&s;&s;ed,</HI> He mi&s;took or He lied. If
<PB N="6" REF="003296_0007_0FF03EC5CFB462C0">he had done &s;o in this particular, and &s;o in the re&s;t, he would have <HI>di&s;proved</HI> all the Doctor's A&s;&s;ertions in his Letters to the Royal Society. But after all, (if tho&s;e Stories or Accounts were Mi&s;takes,) they were undoubtedly the real Sen|timents of the Doctor; (as well as many o|thers;) and for <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> to treat his Communicati|ons (which men of the greate&s;t Characters a|broad receiv'd with Deference and Re&s;pect) with &s;uch In&s;olence and Rudene&s;s, it proves him unworthy the Nation from which he boa&s;ts Original, and unde&s;erving of any E&s;teem or Practice in the <HI>American</HI> Regions.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not run into any long Animadver&s;ions on Dr. BRADY of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> for &s;aying (as <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> quotes him, p. 7.) <HI>What wretched work the Gen|tleman</HI> (h. e. Dr. MATHER) <HI>makes in his Ac|counts</HI>? It was ridiculous in him to &s;ay &s;o, unle&s;s he <HI>knew</HI> and could <HI>prove</HI> (which he could not) his <HI>Accounts</HI> to be <HI>wretched</HI>; and it was <HI>wretched Folly</HI> in <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> to produce his Scrible for nothing; unle&s;s indeed it might &s;ooth him in his Misfortune, of being the Doctors Ene|my and <HI>Accu&s;er,</HI> to find one (as there now and then has happen'd &s;uch an one) who has de|tracted from the Doctor as well as he. But I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t here.</P>
<P>NOR &s;hall I add any thing further in Favour of the Doctor, but that I would have <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> know, if his <HI>Credulity</HI> was ever &s;o great in other things; he was not &s;o <HI>credulous</HI> as to believe him endued with <HI>Learning</HI> or <HI>Wit,</HI> with <HI>Vertue</HI> or <HI>Honour,</HI> with <HI>Civility</HI> or <HI>Manners</HI>; and I find a con&s;iderable part of the Town in this of the &s;ame Opinion with the Doctor.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003296_0008_0FEFDB588282F1C0">I &s;aid, I would add nothing further; but I cannot help &s;ubjoining, that if <HI>D&mdash;s,</HI> or any o|ther of the &s;ame ra&s;h and illjudging <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> (he will forgive the <HI>Medical Terms</HI>) with him, &s;hall dare to attack the Name and Reputation of the Doctor, he and they &s;hall know, there are &s;ome who will always ri&s;e in his Defence to their Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>AND now for <HI>Inoculation</HI>! Without any fo|reign and u&s;ele&s;s Remarks, which would &s;well my Letter to a Volumn, let us come to the Merits of the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>AND here, at the &s;ame Time that I am flu&s;h'd with Joy to find how frankly <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> owns that Dr. MEAD, Sir HANS SLOANE &amp; PITCAIRN his Coun|tryman, all celebrated Phy&s;icians, <HI>countenanced and favoured</HI> the Practice; (tho' by the way this looks as if they had <HI>Credulity</HI> as well as Dr. MATHER) I am fill'd with &s;orrow that I have not one of tho&s;e Gentlemen's Books by me, nor any one of the other Treati&s;es, out of which <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> has &s;elected Pa&s;&s;ages; &s;o that I cannot tell whether he has quoted them exactly or no: For my part my <HI>Credulity</HI> &s;hall run &s;o far as to allow it.</P>
<P>GRANTING then that all his Quotations are ju&s;t and fair; let us Examine the &s;everal Heads he has offer'd, under which he has collected <HI>the Hi&s;tories of Facts,</HI> as he calls them, from Dr. NETTLETON, Mr. MAITLAND and others.</P>
<P N="1">1. FROM NETTLETON and MAITLAND he &s;ays and &s;hows, that <HI>&s;ome receive not the Di&s;temper at all.</HI> And what then? <HI>Some receive not the Di&s;temper at all</HI> in the natural Way, when they are &s;urrounded on every &s;ide with it: Perhaps
<PB N="8" REF="003296_0009_0FF03ECBEC032E70">there may be no proper <HI>Pabulum</HI> in their Bodies for it to prey on. Why then &s;hould this be accounted an Objection again&s;t <HI>Inoculation</HI>? For how is it likely or po&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould take Effect, when the <HI>Fluids</HI> are not in a Capacity to receive it? But granting they were, and allowing that the Operation had no &s;uch Effect as to procure the Di&s;temper; &s;till tho&s;e who are Inoculated are not a whit the wor&s;e for it: Nay, I have Rea&s;on to think &s;ome have fared the <HI>better</HI> for it. The Reverend Mr. <HI>W&mdash;</HI> now living at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> on whom it <HI>did not take place,</HI> (as <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> beautifully tran&s;lates a Pa&s;&s;age in PYLARINUS) has enjoyed his Health <HI>&s;ince</HI> he was inoculated much better than <HI>before</HI>; and he a&s;|cribes it, in part, to his <HI>Inci&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. HE remarks, from his Author Mr. MAIT|LAND that <HI>&s;ome had only Eruptive Fevers</HI>: I &s;uppo&s;e, he means re&s;ulting from <HI>Inoculation,</HI> or he has no meaning at all. But who will be di&s;&s;waded from <HI>Inoculation</HI> if there really were two or three &s;uch In&s;tances? Pray, Doctor BOYLSTON, when you &s;ee <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> ask him, Whe|ther the&s;e <HI>Eruptive Fevers</HI> are the <HI>natural</HI> and genuine <HI>Effect</HI> of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> or whether (to u&s;e a word or two of his) they ari&s;e only from &s;ome <HI>accidental Contagition</HI>? If he &s;ays <HI>the former,</HI> you can ea&s;ily prove the contrary by numerous witne&s;&s;es and inconte&s;tible: For who among your inoculated Patients has had this <HI>eruptive Fever</HI>? Be &s;o kind as to tell him or me, if <HI>any one</HI> has. But if he &s;ays <HI>the latter,</HI> it had been better for him to have laid a&s;ide his <HI>di|abetical Pen,</HI> than permit its Dropping to &s;o lit|tle Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="9" REF="003296_0010_0FF03ECFE85FE448">
3. HE takes notice from Dr. NETTLETON, that <HI>others from</HI> Inoculation <HI>have the Small-Pox to &s;o</HI> &s;mall a Degree <HI>as to admit of</HI> Doubt. Dr. NETTLETON may &s;ay, that <HI>in three of</HI> his <HI>Patients</HI> the Eruptions <HI>were &s;o imperfect as to leave</HI> him in Doubt: But then, as I remember, he &s;ome|where ob&s;erves, that his <HI>Doubts</HI> were di&s;&s;ipated at their Recovery; for then they went any where, regardle&s;s of the Contagion and invulne|rable: And if others fare in the &s;ame Manner, where will be the Di&s;advantage to <HI>Inoculation</HI> or tho&s;e who receive it? Sure I am this looks ra|ther as a <HI>Proof</HI> and <HI>Confirmation</HI> of <HI>Inoculation</HI> than any <HI>Objection</HI> again&s;t it.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>OTHERS have the wor&s;t Sort.</HI> For Peace &s;ake, I am ready to allow <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> and his Friends this; but he will allow me to &s;ay <HI>mode&s;tly</HI> with PYLARINUS, <HI>they mo&s;t</HI> frequently <HI>have the</HI> di&s;tinct <HI>Sort.</HI> Here <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> may learnedly comment on <HI>mo&s;t frequently,</HI> (as in pag. 11.) h. e. <HI>not always</HI> &s;o. And I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it is <HI>not always</HI> &s;o, that tho&s;e who are <HI>inoculated</HI> have the <HI>di&s;tinct and be&s;t</HI> Sort. It would be cen&s;ur'd as unfair here, if I &s;hould &s;ay that &s;uch <HI>may have received the</HI> Small-Pox <HI>before</HI> Inoculation; but is it not equally unju&s;t to lay either the <HI>coheerent</HI> or <HI>con|fluent</HI> Kind to <HI>Inoculation</HI>? It is certainly as ab&s;urd, at lea&s;t, to &s;ay, that even in Times of <HI>General In|fection</HI> none may have taken the De&s;temper <HI>before</HI> they have been <HI>inoculated</HI>; as it is unfair to pro|nounce &s;uch infected <HI>before Inoculation</HI> who have it very bad: So that under this Head the con|tending Parties may &s;hake hands. But for Argu|ment &s;ake, I &s;hould be willing to allow that &s;ome
<PB N="10" REF="003296_0011_0FF03ED16B0B8FD0">who have receiv'd the Small-Pox by <HI>Inci&s;ions,</HI> have yet been very full of <HI>Pocks,</HI> and even of the <HI>confluent Kind</HI>; but then they are very <HI>few</HI> in Compari&s;on with tho&s;e who have a <HI>benign Sort and favourable Symptoms,</HI> as all who are not blind, or perver&s;ely wilful and illnatur'd, may See. Even the dull, the heavy-ey'd, the &s;leepy <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> him&s;elf can perceive it, and dares acknow|lege it in pag. 25. and 26.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>SOME have died of it.</HI> I am free to grant it, to oblige him, (who never obliged any body nor favoured any Thing, unle&s;s for his own Pro|fit, viz.) our Graduated Friend. But if <HI>&s;ome</HI> have died, their Number is <HI>very Small.</HI> Dr. JURIN, as <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> confe&s;&s;es, has &s;hewed that, of tho&s;e who have been inoculated in <HI>Great Britain, nine</HI> only have died in 448, which is <HI>one</HI> in about 49, or 50. And the &s;ame ingenious Doctor has pro|ved from the Bills of Mortality at <HI>London,</HI> that one in about 6, or 7, or 8. at farthe&s;t, have died of the <HI>natural Small-Pox.</HI> For my part I am ready to acknowlege, (what he de&s;ires and con|tends for pag. 22.) that but <HI>one</HI> in <HI>ten</HI> here have died of the <HI>natural Small-Pox</HI>; or, if it will &s;atify him and his Chronies, that but <HI>one</HI> in <HI>Twenty</HI> have given up the Gho&s;t with it: And yet, when I have allowed this, the Practice of <HI>Inoculation</HI> appears by far the mo&s;t <HI>&s;ucce&s;sful and advantageous</HI>; and therefore every wi&s;e Man, in Danger of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> will prefer the taking of it <HI>by Inci&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>As for tho&s;e who have died <HI>under,</HI> or <HI>after,</HI> or (if he plea&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">) <HI>of Inoculation</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI>; I cannot but think, and I have the Plea&s;ure to find that many are with me in the Opinion, that, if the &s;ordid <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> had any Thing of the <HI>Generous</HI> in his abject Mind, he would have relied upon it, that you have fairly ac|knowleged
<PB N="11" REF="003296_0012_0FF03ED2ED5A4678"><HI>all and every one</HI> you knew to have died <HI>under or of it</HI>: But it &s;eems he won't believe you. And why? Becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, <HI>Mrs. G. whi&s;pers that there were many more who died of it.</HI> And will Mr. <HI>Goo&s;e</HI> believe her <HI>Whi&s;per</HI> &s;ooner than your <HI>open Declaration</HI>? And not &s;he alone &s;ays this; but (con|tinues he p. 14.) <HI>&s;ome</HI> Porters <HI>&s;ay that it was</HI> whi&s;per'd <HI>in &s;un|dry Hou&s;es, where the</HI> Dead <HI>had been carried from, that the Per|&s;on had been</HI> inoculated. But if he places &s;uch Confidence in what <HI>&s;ome Porters</HI> heard whi&s;per'd &s;ure I am he de&s;erves to be treated like a <HI>Porter.</HI> And I cannot but think it no <HI>Small Reflection</HI> on our <HI>Ultrajectine Doctor</HI>; that he knows what <HI>the Porters</HI> &s;ay; it looks as if he were acquainted with them. But this is not all. To the&s;e Reports he adds p. 15. <HI>I am certain of</HI> one more <HI>who died after</HI> Inoculation, <HI>as they expre&s;s it, having with her</HI> Inoculator <HI>attended her in her Illne&s;s, this was Hou&s;e|keeper to</HI> &amp;c. Here I could make You and my&s;elf merry with that admirable Paragraph, <HI>having with her Inoculator attended her in her Illne&s;s</HI>; But I will not, as long as I know his Mean|ing. In An&s;wer to which, I prote&s;t, fir&s;t of all, that I que&s;tion whether &s;he was <HI>Inoculated</HI>? But if &s;he was, I maintain <HI>her Death</HI> is no Di&s;grace to <HI>Inoculation</HI>: For it is <HI>whi&s;per'd,</HI> (And may not our <HI>Whi&s;pers</HI> be as good as <HI>D&mdash;s</HI>'?) that &s;he was a <HI>Strum|pet,</HI> who (if &s;he had not at the time of her Inoculation &s;ome <HI>foul Di&s;temper</HI>) had &s;ome Remains of the <HI>Venereal</HI> Taint in her gro&s;s &amp; filthy Body; But if &s;he were as cha&s;t, vertuous &amp; pure as <HI>Diana</HI> her&s;elf, her <HI>Small Pox Feaver,</HI> he confe&s;&s;es <HI>began after two Days,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e he means <HI>on the third Day</HI>: It is therefore at lea&s;t probable that the Wench had receiv'd <HI>the Infection before</HI>; and by con&s;equence it was hardly worth his while to make any noi&s;e about it.</P>
<P>AS to what he has remark'd of Capt. OSBORN's Account in the Royal Tran&s;actions; it is enough to &s;ay, that tho&s;e Words, <HI>I knew</HI> of &s;o many who were inoculated, were expres'd in a loo&s;e and carele&s;s Manner by him; and that all he &s;eems to mean, is, he <HI>believ'd</HI> there had been <HI>that Number</HI> or thereabouts inoculated; which indeed was all he could pretend to &s;ay: For it is que&s;tio|nable whether he did or could ab&s;olutely <HI>know,</HI> being at <HI>London,</HI> how many you had inoculated, unle&s;s you had &s;ent him an Ac|count, which I &s;uppo&s;e yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> did not. From his Account therefore, for <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> to gather and a&s;&s;ert that 20 or 30 Inoculated Per&s;ons <HI>are concealed, many of which</HI> (he &s;ays, p. 15.) <HI>without Doubt are in their &s;ilent Graves</HI>; it &s;hows he has a great deal of ill natur'd <HI>Par|tiality,</HI> unrea&s;onable <HI>Prejudice</HI> and faulty <HI>Credulity</HI> again&s;t <HI>Ino|culation</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003296_0013_0FF03ED54B0ACC28">Upon what he further relates (p. 15. &amp; 16.) of the two Que&s;ti|ons, which either he or &s;ome other Noddy askt; I &s;hall only ob|&s;erve that I conceive the <HI>latter</HI> did not an&s;wer his Que&s;tion &s;o well as the <HI>former</HI>: For <HI>Silence</HI> is the be&s;t An&s;wer to an imper|tinent Que&s;tion, whether it be askt by a knowing Phy&s;ician or an illiterate Mechanick.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> goes on, &amp; &s;ays, that <HI>Inoculation &s;ometimes leaves Im|po&s;tumations and other Ails.</HI> For this he quotes a Pa&s;&s;age of PYLARINUS, which I wi&s;h he had been &s;o kind as to tran&s;late, but he would not; becau&s;e that Author writes, however &s;uch Things have happened, <HI>rari&s;&s;ime tamen,</HI> they are mo&s;t rare and unu&s;ual. So it has proved in <HI>New-England,</HI> and perhaps the &s;ame would have appeared more fully in <HI>Brittain,</HI> if due Care had been taken to <HI>purge</HI> the Re&s;tored.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> plumply affirms pag. 17. <HI>tho&s;e who have had a Genuine Small-Pox by</HI> Inoculation <HI>never</HI> can <HI>have</HI> it <HI>again in the natural way</HI> by Rea&s;on and Experience. A bold A&s;&s;ertion this! But, as bold as it is, he &s;ays, <HI>We may confidently pronounce</HI> it; &s;o that now he &s;eems to be one of <HI>us.</HI> I believe, that he, and &s;ome other Doctors in Town, have held the contrary; and I hope they will &s;hew them&s;elves, now at lea&s;t as ingenuous as he, by making a <HI>publick Retractation.</HI></P>
<P>But what if from their Inci&s;ions, the Patients have not <HI>the genuine Small-Pox,</HI> but <HI>imperfect Eruptions</HI>? Will the&s;e excu&s;e them from the <HI>Small-Pox</HI>? To be plain and open, Doctor BOYLSTONE, I would roundly &s;ay <HI>No.</HI> And I may well &s;ay &s;o: For Dr. JURIN imagines it po&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e who have fairly had the Small-Pox in the <HI>natural way</HI> to have it a <HI>Second Time,</HI> and He brings <HI>an example</HI> for the Proof of it: This I could not but take Notice of in his Treati&s;e <HI>of Inoculation,</HI> dedicated to the Prince&s;s of WALES; but not having his Book, which I obtain'd of a Friend, now by me, I cannot refer to the Page where this is reported. But upon it I think it proper to remark, that as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he In&s;tances of this <HI>Second</HI> Infection are uncommon in the <HI>natural Way</HI>; So they are unu&s;ual in the way of <HI>Inci&s;ions</HI>: They are &s;carcer, a far greater Rarity than <HI>Pious</HI> and Religious <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI>: For <HI>ubi tres Medici, ibi duo Athei</HI>; but among <HI>three hundred</HI> Per|&s;ons who have had the Small-Pox from <HI>Inci&s;ions,</HI> there have hardly been <HI>two,</HI> who have had it again.</P>
<P N="8">8. He &s;ays p. 20. <HI>If it is not us'd with</HI> Circum&s;pection, <HI>it is of</HI> pernicious Con&s;equence <HI>to populous and Trading Towns.</HI> Here I frankly acknowledge, that, if only <HI>two or three</HI> Per&s;ons have the <HI>Small Pox</HI> in a City or Town, and there were no
<PB N="13" REF="003296_0014_0FF03ED6D41CDD60">likelihood of its Spreading, it is not &s;o proper, nay, to gra|tify him, it is <HI>pernicious</HI> to inoculate and &s;pread the Infection: But where many already have it, and &s;everal are daily vi&s;ited with it, <HI>unbounded Inoculation</HI> (in his Style) &s;eems to me &s;o far from <HI>an Hard&s;hip</HI> and a <HI>damping of Trade,</HI> that I am verily per&s;waded, if all tho&s;e in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> who have not had the <HI>Small Pox</HI> would be <HI>inoculated in one week,</HI> it would be <HI>va&s;tly better</HI> for the Town: For thereby we &s;hould be &s;peedily rid of the Di&s;temper. But now, if the Small Pox goes on in the u&s;ual Method, the Town mu&s;t linger under it many Months, and its <HI>Trade</HI> and Commerce will not only <HI>be damp'd</HI>; but have <HI>a Stop</HI> in a great Mea&s;ure put to it for a con&s;iderable Time.</P>
<P N="9">9. I have nothing to write again&s;t what he remarks (p. 21.) of the <HI>Communication</HI> of con&s;titutional <HI>Di&s;tempers as a Diffi|culty</HI>: It will perhaps be found <HI>one,</HI> if the <HI>Pus</HI> be taken from tho&s;e of <HI>bad Con&s;titutions and ill Habits</HI>: But where will be the <HI>Difficulty,</HI> if the <HI>Pus</HI> be taken from one, who before the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> was a &s;ound &amp; vigorous Youth, who&s;e Juices were in a <HI>due State of Fluidity,</HI> and who therefore was <HI>in Perfect Health.</HI> In this Ca&s;e, I &s;hould think the Patient &s;afe, and (to borrow from <HI>D&mdash;s</HI>) I &s;hould take all <HI>Fear</HI> to be <HI>chimerical and conjectural.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have gone through his &s;everal Heads or Propo&s;itions, which he has confirm'd by Authorities: I could ea&s;ily ani|madvert on &s;ome more Particulars under tho&s;e general Heads; but it is Time almo&s;t to conclude my Letter.</P>
<P>Indeed I can't help thinking, that <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> him&s;elf, in pag 25. has <HI>in a few Lines</HI> overthrown all the foregoing Part of his <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation,</HI> wherein <HI>the Difficulties and Di&s;couragements of Inoculation</HI> are laid down by him: For there he allows, <HI>that the</HI> Small Pox <HI>receiv'd by</HI> Inci&s;ions <HI>is found not &s;o</HI> mortal, <HI>and that the</HI> Symptoms <HI>are generally</HI> more favourable, <HI>than when it is receiv'd by</HI> accidental Contagition. Now, you, nor I, nor yet any other rea&s;onable Man, can de&s;ire any more: For if the Small Pox is <HI>le&s;s mortal</HI> and <HI>the Symptoms</HI> are more favoura|ble by <HI>Inci&s;ions</HI> than by the <HI>natural way</HI>; then he is a <HI>Simple|ton,</HI> not to &s;ay wor&s;e, who when he is in Danger, will not be <HI>inoculated.</HI> And then, if, as he further writes in the &s;ame Page, <HI>one may take the advantage of benign Small-Pox Con&s;ti|tution and a favourable Sea&s;on of the Year</HI>; if one may pre|pare his Body <HI>for it, and remove the Anxiety</HI> which &s;ome are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with thro' <HI>Fear of the Small Pox</HI>: I &s;ay, if all the&s;e <HI>Benefits</HI> and Advantages flow from <HI>Inoculation,</HI> he, who is near the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and does not get <HI>inoculated,</HI> either knows not
<PB N="14" REF="003296_0015_0FF03ED861619BC8">his Intere&s;t or di&s;regards his Welfare. <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> him&s;elf mu&s;t have drawn <HI>this Conclu&s;ion,</HI> if he had made <HI>any</HI> Inference from what he &s;ays of the <HI>Advantages of Inoculation.</HI></P>
<P>It plea&s;es me much, that the Phy&s;icians in Town don't think <HI>Inoculation criminal</HI> now, whatever might be their Concepti|ons formerly: But <HI>D&mdash;s</HI>'s Rea&s;on (I &s;ay his; for it can never be theirs) is poor for obviating <HI>their</HI> &s;u&s;picion that it was &s;o; viz. <HI>The Example of the Royal Family.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s their <HI>Example</HI> is of great Force; and the &s;ucce&s;s the Practice of Ino|culation has met with on the <HI>Royal Off&s;pring,</HI> the Hopes and Joys of <HI>Britain</HI> and its Dependencies is a &s;trong Inducement and &s;ufficient Encouragement to the Practice, were it in its own nature <HI>indifferent</HI>: But if the <HI>Practice</HI> be a <HI>Crime</HI> in it &s;elf, no <HI>Examples,</HI> however <HI>&s;ucce&s;sful,</HI> in favour of it, would make it cea&s;e to be <HI>criminal.</HI></P>
<P>What he &s;ays, (in page 26, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>the Practitioners in Town do generally re&s;olve to perform the Operation when requi|red</HI>) is very greatful to you, I believe, as well as the other Friends of Inoculation: It &s;hows they have a ju&s;t value for the Lives of good People: their <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> is a credit, and their <HI>Second Thoughts</HI> will bring <HI>Honours</HI> to them: It is frequent for fal|lible Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in Mi&s;takes</HI> thro' Pride <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Ob&s;tinacy; and yet it is mon&s;trous, ab&s;urd and di&s;reputable</P>
<P>But it is now high time to break off; I &s;hall do &s;o, by wi&s;h|ing that no one will be &s;o <HI>unadvi&s;ed</HI> as to tru&s;t him&s;elf in <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> hands under <HI>Inoculation</HI>; (for I believe <HI>he</HI> &s;till retains &s;ome of his <HI>old Spleen</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Practice</HI>); by letting you know that, let <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> write what he will about <HI>Inoculation or any thing el&s;e,</HI> I will (if no one el&s;e will expo&s;e him) take lie&s;ure Op|portunity to &s;how his <HI>Blunders and Errors</HI>; and by a&s;&s;uring you, that I am, with great E&s;teem and Affection,</P>
