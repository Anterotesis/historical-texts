<P>_HAPPINESS is what all Mankind are in an eager pur&s;uit of, in this there is an unanimous agreement: But where it is to be found, where|in it con&s;i&s;ts, and by what Methods to be obtained; has been a controver&s;y agitated by tho&s;e, who have been under the &s;ole conduct of the dim light of Nature.

<P><PB N="7" REF="002998_0010_0FEFADAE35C09EC0">
We &s;hall begin with the fir&s;t of the&s;e Ob&s;er|vations which is,</P>
<P><HI>THAT GOD is not only de&s;irous to be Ho|noured by the Service and Obedience of his People, but of the Welfare</HI> &amp; <HI>Happine&s;s of them and their Po&s;terity.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;hall be &s;poken to under the&s;e following Po&s;itions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That GOD de&s;ires and &s;eeks his own Glory.</HI> For this He &s;poke a World into Being, and by His Almighty Power &amp; Re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Arm, doth &s;o rule &amp; govern all the things contained, and all the actions by His Creatures done therein, as to &s;hew forth the <HI>honour</HI> and magnify the <HI>power,</HI> and <HI>wi&s;dom of their Creator.</HI> The things which He hath made &s;hew forth His <HI>Eternal Power and Godhead</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 1. 21.</NOTE>, and all things &s;hew forth the Prai&s;es of the mo&s;t High.

The <HI>mo&s;t Perfect Being</HI> will have the mo&s;t perfect End and De&s;igns in all His Actions. And it is in|compatible with the Divine Nature, to do any thing, that &s;hall derogate from His mo&s;t Glori|ous Perfections; &s;o is it likewi&s;e to Him to form
<PB N="8" REF="002998_0011_0FEFADB2264B3900">
any other principal End in His Actions, than His own Glory. That which was in appearance, a di&s;honour done to the Divine Nature; (I mean its union to the Humane Nature in the per&s;on of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, <HI>Who appeared in the form of a &s;ervant</HI>) was in reality the greate&s;t and brighte&s;t manife&s;tation of the Glory of GOD that ever was made to a &s;inful world. So many times in the Divine Actions, tho' we don't &s;ee how GOD con&s;ults His own Glory; for Clouds and Darkne&s;s are round about His Throne: Yet in the Event it &s;hall be made apparent, that no|thing &s;hort of <HI>an Infinite Wi&s;dom</HI> could &s;o have ordered and di&s;po&s;ed of all things and actions, for the accompli&s;hing of that great &amp; glorious end. 'Tis true that &s;ome of His Rebellious and perver&s;e Creatures refu&s;e to give Him Glory Actively, but GOD will make their perver&s;e|ne&s;s and Rebellion to &s;erve the &s;ame great De|&s;ign, and will Glorify Him&s;elf upon them pa&s;&s;ive|ly, who refu&s;e to give that Tribute of Honour and Prai&s;e to Him, to whom its due.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That GOD is honoured and glorified by the &s;ervice and obedience of His People.</HI></P>
<P>As we have &s;aid before, for this end they were made to Glorify GOD; &s;o this is the way by which they do Him Honour. Not that there can be any addition made to His <HI>E&s;&s;ential Glory,</HI> for that is <HI>Infinite:</HI> but by the Obedience of His People, the Divine Honour &amp; Glory is declared in the <HI>World.</HI> Tho' this <HI>E&s;&s;ential Glory</HI> can't ad|mit of or &s;uffer diminution, yet His <HI>Declaritive</HI>

may; with re&s;pect to the former, it may be &s;aid, that neither our Obedience nor Di&s;obedience can't affect it. <HI>It is as high as heaven what can&s;t thou do?</HI> Con&s;onant to what <HI>Elihu</HI> &s;aith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job 35. 6,7,8.</NOTE> <HI>If thou &s;inne&s;t what do&s;t thou again&s;t him; or if thy Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions be multiplied what do&s;t thou unto Him?

Thy wickedne&s;s may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s may profit the &s;on of man.</HI> But al|tho' it cannot be dimini&s;hed as to its <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> yet as to its <HI>Manife&s;tation,</HI> it may &s;uffer an <HI>Eclip&s;e.</HI> As the light of the Sun, is not le&s;&s;ened by the interpo&s;ition of the Moon between us and that, where by its rays are intercepted; yet the manife&s;tation of that light to us, is.

So al&s;o on the other hand, a Per&s;on that <HI>mi&s;ta|kenly</HI> or by a <HI>meer chance</HI> injures another in his Intere&s;ts, de&s;erveth not his Anger, which had been otherwi&s;e, had there been <HI>de&s;ign</HI> in it.

<P>It is our ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Expectation from You, that you faithfully di&s;charge the tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in you by GOD, your KING and <HI>Country;</HI> that you your &s;elves &s;eek the Pro&s;perity of this People; and that you make Choice of &s;uch to be of his Maje&s;ty's Council, as &s;hall be true to the Temporal and Religious Intere&s;ts of this Land. That in your Elections you be not under the in|fluence of any private or &s;ini&s;ter view: That you choo&s;e Men that Fear GOD and Honour the KING; Men of approved Fidelity to their Prince and Country; Men of Courage &amp; Re&s;olution, that dare a&s;&s;ert the Rights and Liberties of the People, and will give to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> the things that are <HI>Cae&s;ar's,</HI> and to GOD the things that are GOD's; and that will not give into any mea&s;ures de&s;tructive to our true Intere&s;ts Civil &amp; Religious, tho' they &s;hould mi&s;s of popular Applau&s;e, and endanger a being dropt at the next Election: Men of Wi&s;dom and Skill, equal to the Province they undertake, and that know what I&s;rael ought to do in &s;uch a Day as this; who &s;hall not tremble at the frowns of the Great, nor have a fondne&s;s for that in&s;ignificant toy &amp; trifle, <HI>popular Prai&s;e:</HI> That in your Choice you be not bia&s;&s;ed by per&s;onal Re|&s;pects, nor prejudiced by &s;ecret Sugge&s;tions: Nor &s;uppo&s;e a Man qualified to &s;et at the Honourable Board meerly becau&s;e he will be a Tool to pro|mote &s;ome particular De&s;ign or Intere&s;t in view;
<PB N="39" REF="002998_0042_0FEFAE0039D1C5E8">
but Men of known Character for Piety towards GOD, Loyalty to their Prince and Probity to|wards Men; Men who &s;hall act up to their Dig|nity and &s;corn to be under the malign Influences of a Party Spirit, who &s;hall always have the true Intere&s;t of their KING and Country in view, and &s;teadily pro&s;ecute all mea&s;ures conducive thereunto; whom neither Frowns nor Bribes can divert therefrom.</P>
<P>Your Wi&s;dom, Piety and Zeal for the Glory of GOD, and the Welfare of this his People are greatly relied upon; and a Unanimity in pu&s;u|ing all proper Methods for the accompli&s;hing hereof is much de&s;ired and wi&s;hed for. This will &s;how you to be Fathers to your Country, and will give us a joyful Pro&s;pect that it &s;hall be well with us and our Children for ever.</P>
<P>I would in the next place apply my &s;elf to my Reverend Fathers and Brethren in the <HI>Mi|ni&s;try;</HI> not for their Information, but to excite and quicken them to the indu&s;trious Improve|ment of the Talents, Advantages and Opportu|nities put into their hands to promote the Inte|re&s;ts of the People that the great Shepherd of the Sheep hath committed to their Charge. <HI>We</HI> of all Men are the mo&s;t deeply obliged to Fear GOD and keep his Commandments, and to lay out our&s;elves, that others may do &s;o too; that we may be able, when the chief Shepherd &s;hall appear, to give up a joyful Account of our &s;elves and them that He hath committed to our Care; and may receive a Crown of Glory that

fadeth not away. To promote practical Reli|gion &s;hould be the great end of our Mini&s;try: This is what is worthy to expend our Zeal upon, and not in unhappy Jangles about &s;peculative Opinions that have no influence on our Morals. Though <HI>by the Deeds of the Law, &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified, yet without the Deeds of the Law, can none be &s;aved:</HI> Though a Man be a &s;ound Believer; (I mean Orthodox in the faith) unle&s;s he be a &s;incere Convert, his <HI>Religion is as a &s;ound|ing Bra&s;s and a tinkling Cymbal.</HI> I would not be under&s;tood to intimate as if Moral vertues, were to be i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;i&s;ted upon only or principally in our Preaching &amp; inculcated upon our Auditory; No, Faith in JESUS CHRIST and Repen|tance unto Life are the great Doctrines of the Go&s;pel; and which when rightly under&s;tood, will be found to be the foundation of all true Obe|dience: and the&s;e only conduce to make us a Holy &amp; Religions People. For this end CHRIST, when per&s;onally here preached them: and for this he gave Him&s;elf for us, <HI>that He might redeem us from all iniquity and purify to Him&s;elf a pecu|liar People zealous of good works.</HI> And to pro&s;e|cute the &s;ame glorious End, &amp; by the &s;ame Means, is incumbent on Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters who will never more &s;uccesfully promote the intere&s;ts of Reli|gion, than by Preaching the Doctrines of Faith and Repentance. In this let us labour, and be unwearied: Tho' the work be difficult in it &s;elf, and many di&s;couragements attending of it, ari&s;ing from Hell beneath, and its children here on Earth;
<PB N="41" REF="002998_0044_0FEFAE0560605C50">
yet we have this to encourage us, that He that hath &s;ent us hath promi&s;ed to be with us unto the End of the World. Our Work is great, our Strength is &s;mall, our Time is &s;hort, &s;ome of our be&s;t &amp; mo&s;t indu&s;trious Labourers in GOD's Vineyard, are cal|led away to receive their Wages; &amp; we are left to bear the heat &amp; burden of the Day. All which Con|&s;iderations &s;hould make us more prayerful, more diligent, more laborious in our mini&s;terial Work, that we may approve our&s;elves faithful to GOD, faithful to his People, faithful to our own Souls; and this will intitle us to an untarni&s;hed, unfa|ding Crown of Glory when the chief Shepherd &s;hall appear.</P>
<P>I &s;hall Conclude when I have briefly addre&s;&s;ed my &s;elf to the People of this Land, that they would lay the&s;e things to Heart and &s;trenuou&s;ly apply them&s;elves to &s;eek their own and Po&s;teri|ties Welfare and Happine&s;s in the way &amp; me|thod in our Text pre&s;cribed. Without you, all that our Rulers in Civil and Sacred Orders can do, will not avail. Tho' our Legi&s;lators enact never &s;o many good Laws for the regulation of the Morals of a People, unle&s;s You do your part, and improve the Power and Liberty you are in|ve&s;ted with in your &s;everal Towns to make choice of &s;uch for your Grand-jurors, Tything men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as are Men fearing GOD, Men of Truth &amp; Fide|lity, Men of Wi&s;dom equal to the Tru&s;t commit|ted to them and have the intere&s;ts of Religion at heart; who will carefully in&s;pect the Manners of the People, and bring the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors to open

&s;hame and puni&s;hment. I &s;ay, unle&s;s you are careful and con&s;cientious in this, all our Laws for the reforming the Manners of a corrupt People, are in&s;ignificant, and our Law-makers labour in vain. And tho' the Mini&s;ters of the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel &s;hould &s;et the Doctrines thereof in the cleare&s;t and brighte&s;t Light, and with the mo&s;t cogent Arguments, and forcible Motives pre&s;s practical Religion upon their People; unle&s;s you encourage their hearts &amp; &s;trengthen their hands, and joyn with them in their endeavours to &s;tem that torrent of Vice &amp; Profanene&s;s which has broke in upon us; They will take up that Melancholly complaint, <HI>we have laboured in vain, and &s;pent our &s;trength for nought and in vain.</HI> Oh! that there were &s;uch an heart in this People to Fear GOD and Keep His Commandments: And to exert them&s;elves in their &s;everal Capacities &s;o to promote the Peace and Pro&s;perity of our Church and State: to put up &s;trong Cries to our Fathers GOD, that He would pour out a Spirit of Re|pentance and Reformation on their degenerate Offspring. Then the LORD our GOD will be with us, as He was with our Fathers, and never leave us nor for&s;ake us. This GOD of His In|finite Mercy grant for the &s;ake of His only SON our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, to whom be Glory &amp; Prai&s;e for ever, AMEN.</P>
