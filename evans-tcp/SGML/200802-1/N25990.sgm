<HEAD>ADVENTURES OF PEREGRINE PICKLE.</HEAD>
<P>PEREGRINE PICKLE was the &s;on of Mr. Gabriel Pickle, who had formerly kept a &s;hop in London, but the profits of his trade not an&s;wering to his wi&s;hes, he retired to Corn|wall, where he purcha&s;ed an e&s;tate, and married a young lady, the daughter of a country gen|tleman. His &s;i&s;ter, Mi&s;s Pickle, a maid of about forty, had been for &s;everal years his hou&s;ekeeper, but there being no occa&s;ion for her in that ca|pacity, after he was married, &s;he began to look out for a hu&s;band. She was too old to attract the notice of the gentry, and becau&s;e her father had been once Lord Mayor of London, &s;o &s;he could not bear the thought of giving her hand to a trade&s;man.</P>
<P>It happened that in the &s;ame neighborhood lived Commodore Trunion, who had been bred up to the &s;ea, and &s;pent mo&s;t of his days in the
<PB N="4" REF="034563_0003_0FFE2BA074D5CD78">
navy. He lived in a hou&s;e fortified in the &s;ame manner as a ca&s;tle, and be&s;ides his dome&s;tics, he kept along with him one Lieutenant Hatchway and Tom Pipes, who had formerly been his boat&s;wain's mate. With the&s;e two he u&s;ed to &s;pend the evenings at a neighboring alehou&s;e, where he became acquainted with Mr. Pickle, and &s;oon after propo&s;ed marrying his &s;i&s;ter. Not that the commodore was in love, but that becau&s;e he could go no more to &s;ea, he propo&s;ed to take a voyage in the &s;ea of matrimony. Like an hone&s;t tar he was downright in his propo&s;als, and as the lady found it would be needle&s;s to a&s;|&s;ume tho&s;e airs peculiar to her &s;ex, &s;he &s;oon gave her con&s;ent, and a day was fixed for the nuptials.</P>
<P>The commodore had purcha&s;ed a couple of fine hunters for him&s;elf and the lieutenant, on which they mounted at nine in the morning to proceed for the church, but as he had never &s;een any thing but naval affairs, he re&s;olved to tack about with the wind, as if he had been on the ocean. It happened that the wind &s;hifted about, and the commodore followed his cour&s;e &s;o long, that his bride waited for him at church with the utmo&s;t impatience. At la&s;t it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;patch a me&s;&s;enger in que&s;t of him, for he was &s;o little acquainted with the church, that it was &s;uppo&s;ed he had mi&s;taken the road.</P>
<P>This, however, was not the ca&s;e, for the me&s;|&s;enger found him and his attendant veering about
<PB N="5" REF="034563_0003_0FFE2BA074D5CD78">
with the wind like a fleet at &s;ea, and told him that the company were waiting for him at church. The commodore an&s;wered with great deliberation, that he had weighed anchor about nine in the morning, for the port of matrimony, but the wind had &s;hifted &s;o often about, that he believed he would not be able to get to the har|bor that day. As the me&s;&s;enger did not know what he meant, he told him that he had no more to do than turn his hor&s;e's head and follow him, by which they would be at the church in le&s;s than half an hour. The commodore was &s;o much exa&s;perated at what the me&s;&s;enger &s;aid, that he called him an ignorant fellow, who did not under&s;tand the trim of a ve&s;&s;el, and there|fore de&s;ired him to &s;heer off, or he would pour into him a whole broad&s;ide. The me&s;&s;enger, who found what &s;ort of a per&s;on he had to deal with, left him, and returned back to the church, where he found the company, and the ceremony was obliged to be deferred till next day.</P>
<P>In the mean time the commodore kept &s;hifting about with the wind, till the hor&s;es on which he and Lieutenant Hatchway rode, heard the noi&s;e of hunt&s;men, and being well acquainted with the &s;port, they &s;et out at full gallop, leaving the re&s;t of the company to weather the &s;torm in the be&s;t manner they could. Both the commodore and lieutenant believed they were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> on the back of devils incarnate, and giving up all for
<PB N="6" REF="034563_0004_0FFE2BA1F8836840">
lo&s;t, dropped their whips, and held fa&s;t by the pummels of their &s;addles.&mdash;The hor&s;e on which the lieutenant rode, was more nimble than the other, and getting before, he cro&s;&s;ed into a field of clover, which circum&s;tance gave Hatch|way an opportunity of throwing him&s;elf off, without receiving any other hurt than what aro&s;e from his fright.</P>
<P>In the mean time the commodore, who had dropped his hat and wig, came up, and &s;eeing Hatchway, called out, "Hilloa! you have got &s;afe into port, I wi&s;h to God I was moored." The commodore had &s;ome hopes that a five bar|gate that &s;tood oppo&s;ite to him, would &s;top the progre&s;s of his hor&s;e, but no &s;ooner did he ap|proach it, than he jumped over with as much ca&s;e as a cat would do over a harp&s;icord. He was now in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, he knew not whether he was dead or alive, and at la&s;t com|ing to a highway, enclo&s;ed by two ri&s;ing grounds, the hor&s;e jumped over it, to the no &s;mall terror of a waggoner, who happened to be pa&s;&s;ing un|derneath.</P>
<P>By this time the commodore oververtook the hor&s;e on which the lieutenant had rode, and both kept an equal pace together, till they came to the place where the hunt&s;men were a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee the death of the fox. The &s;trange figure of the commodore in his &s;eamen's dre&s;s, joined to the lo&s;s of his hat and wig, attracted the notice of the whole company, and led off their atten|tion
<PB N="7" REF="034563_0004_0FFE2BA1F8836840">
from poor Reynard, who&s;e agility had furni&s;hed them with &s;o much diver&s;ion. The two hor&s;es were exceeding good ones, and the '&s;quire who conducted the &s;port, a&s;ked the com|modore if he would fell them. "Sell them! aye ma&s;ter; for they are above my weather gage, I have commanded a whole fleet, but was never &s;o much out of my reckoning as to day." The '&s;quire finding that the commodore was a meer novice in land affairs, purcha&s;ed the hor&s;es for one fourth of what they co&s;t, and took the com|modore home with him to his own hou&s;e for the night. The company made them&s;elves very merry at his expen&s;e, but as he knew nothing beyond &s;ea terms, &s;o he took no notice of them, and next day being properly equipped, he re|turned to the ca&s;tle, where he found his old friend Lieutenant Hatchway. Next morning the wind happened to prove favorable, and left he &s;hould once more get on the devil's back, he re&s;olved to walk to the church on foot. Ac|cordingly having di&s;patched Tom Pipes to in|form his bride, the lady met him at the church, and the nuptial knot was tied. A grand enter|tainment was provided at the ca&s;tle, but when the time came for the company to retire, an un|lucky circum&s;tance happened, which was no oth|er than the want of a bed for the new married couple. The commodore was &s;o much of a &s;ea|man, that he obliged every one in the ca&s;tle to lay
<PB N="8" REF="034563_0005_0FFE2BA38286DDA8">
in hammocks, which were &s;lung up in the &s;ame manner as in &s;hips.</P>
<P>The lady remon&s;trated in the &s;tronge&s;t manner again&s;t lying in &s;uch an indecent po&s;ture, but by the per&s;ua&s;ion of her brother and &s;i&s;ter in law, &s;he was induced to comply, and, being undre&s;&s;ed, mounted the hammock to wait the arrival of her &s;pou&s;e. Every thing being properly adju&s;ted for the reception of the commodore, he came into the room, or rather the cabin, where having drank a can of flip, and received three cheers, he got into the canva&s;s vehicle, to the no &s;mall terror of his lady, who imagined every moment that &s;he would tumble out at the other &s;ide The company be|ing now retired, the new married couple went to re&s;t, but no &s;ooner did morning arrive than the lady got up and di&s;patched one of the &s;ervants to a neighboring town to purcha&s;e a genteel bed&s;tead, being now determined to a&s;&s;ert her prerogative as a wife, and not be any longer &s;ubject to the whims and caprice of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>When the commodore &s;aw the bed, he &s;wore, cur&s;ed and bla&s;phemed, declaring that it &s;hould be immediately con&s;igned to the flames, but by the interpo&s;ition of Hatchway and Mr. Pickle, he was brought into a more rea&s;onable way of thinking, and to oblige his &s;pou&s;e, con&s;ented to lie in it, tho contrary to a re&s;olution he had form|ed many years before. The lady proceeded to make &s;everal other alterations in the ca&s;tle, by turning off &s;ome of the old &s;ervants, and ordering
<PB N="9" REF="034563_0005_0FFE2BA38286DDA8">
that the guns &s;hould not be fired but in her ab|&s;ence, le&s;t they &s;hould frighten her &s;o much as to occa&s;ion an abortion. All the&s;e acts of a new reformation the commodore was obliged to com|ply with, and to con&s;ole him&s;elf under what he con&s;idered as real afflictions, he &s;pent more of his time than u&s;ual at the alehou&s;e, cur&s;ing the day that ever he had weghed anchor for the port of matrimony.</P>
<P>The haughty domineering temper of the com|modore's lady, made her odious to every one in the ca&s;tle, but as her hu&s;band was made to be|lieve that &s;he was pregnant, &s;o he bore with it for &s;ome time. At la&s;t, all hopes of an heir be|ing vani&s;hed, the lady took to the bottle and re|ligion for con&s;olation, and the commodore re&s;ol|ved to make young Peregrine his heir. Pere|grine had been &s;ometime at a boarding &s;chool, where he had played abundance of little knavi&s;h tricks, which were winked at by the u&s;her, who frequently received a gratuity from the commo|dore. But the u&s;her, going away, Peregrine wrote a letter to the commodore, who was &s;o much plea&s;ed with it, that he went to his father, and de&s;ired he would &s;uffer him to be brought up under his own direction.</P>
<P>By this time Mr. Pickle, who had another &s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> well as a daughter, looked on the propo&s;al as too valuable to be rejected, &s;o that he in&s;tantly complied with it, e&s;pecially as for rea&s;ons un|known, the mother had conceived the utmo&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="034563_0006_0FFE2BA517780A98">
aver&s;ion for her elde&s;t &s;on. In con&s;equence of this permi&s;&s;ion, Hatchway was di&s;patched the &s;ame day in a po&s;t chai&s;e to the &s;chool, and brought young Peregrine home, who was now in his eleventh year, and began to di&s;play &s;o much genius, that every one was charmed with him. His aunt the lady of the commodore, was &s;o much inured to dram drinking, that when Per|egrine was pre&s;ented to her, &s;he &s;eemed to take no notice of him, but thro the per&s;ua&s;ion of Hatch|way &s;he came down into the parlor, and received him with &s;eeming marks of re&s;pect. Next day the commodore took him to vi&s;it his parents, but how great was his &s;urpri&s;e, when he found that his mother declared that he was not her &s;on, for that he had died when only a child. This, however, made no other impre&s;&s;ion on the com|modore, be&s;ides that of making him love the boy more than ever, and therefore he took him along with him to the ca&s;tle, re&s;olving to be&s;tow that parental care and tenderne&s;s upon him which his mother had denied him, altho &s;he knew it was her duty.</P>
<P>Tom Pipes, who all his life time had been accu&s;tomed to the practice of mi&s;chievious tricks, became, as it were by &s;ympathy, the favorite of young Peregrine, who had one of the mo&s;t fer|tile geniu&s;&s;es that ever fell to the &s;hare of one of his age. As the commodore's lady often retired to her clo&s;et in the evening, under pretence of devotion, but in reality to indulge her&s;elf with
<PB N="11" REF="034563_0006_0FFE2BA517780A98">
her favorite liquors, &s;o our young &s;park, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the artful Tom Pipes, re&s;olved to torment her with the fear of hell and the devil. Sometimes they would climb up to the window of her clo&s;et at midnight, and imitate the &s;cream|ing of an owl, or &s;ome other frightful creature, which operated &s;o &s;trongly upon her di&s;tempered imagination, that &s;he began to think the grand adver&s;ary of mankind had come to take her away before her time.</P>
<P>But the bent of their mi&s;chievous inclinations was not confined to the lady, for they actually di|rected it again&s;t the commodore him&s;elf. The commodore had the utmo&s;t aver&s;ion to attornies ever &s;ince a knavi&s;h one had tricked him in a law|&s;uit, and therefore our adventurers re&s;olved to try his patience on that head, or rather to torment him, as if they had been devils incarnate. Ac|cordingly, they forged a letter to a country at|torney, in the name of the commodore, de&s;iring him to call next day.</P>
<P>The attorney, who doubted not but he would be able to fleece the old commodore of &s;ome hun|dreds, came to the ca&s;tle at the hour of dinner, and Tom Pipes going up &s;tairs, de&s;ired his com|mander to come down to the parlor, to &s;peak to a gentleman who waited for him. This put the commodore into a mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e he was di&s;turbed in the middle of his me&s;s, but recollecting what Pipes &s;aid of the bu&s;ine&s;s be|ing urgent, he went down, and demanded what
<PB N="12" REF="034563_0007_0FFE2BA6F8082D60">
the gentleman wanted with him. The attorney told him that he came according to an order he received from him, and the &s;ooner the bu&s;ine&s;s was di&s;pached the better. "True, &s;aid the com|modore, mad with indignation," and lifting up his &s;tick, gave him &s;uch a blow that he fell flat on the ground. He then hopped up to his chamber to fini&s;h his dinner, congrattulaing him|&s;elf that he had knocked out the brains of a rogui&s;h lawyer.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the attorney had recovered him|&s;elf, &s;o as to be able to get up, he looked about him, to &s;ee whether he could not procure evidence to &s;upport an action on the ca&s;e for an a&s;&s;ault, but &s;eeing none, he crawled up to the dining room, where the commodore was fini&s;hing his me&s;s, and told him that if there was any law in England, he would puni&s;h him to the utmo&s;t rigour of it. He then produced the forged let|ter, which had been &s;ent in the name of the com|modore, but no &s;ooner had the old man read it, than he ordered the attorney to be to&s;&s;ed in a blanket in the ca&s;tle-yard. Hatchway and Pipes performed the operation with &s;o much dexteri|ty, that the &s;kin of the limb of the law, was as disfigured as any &s;heet of parchment that ever i&s;&s;ued from his office. The attorney having received this whole&s;ome di&s;cipline, was then ducked in a hor&s;epond, and was left to pur&s;ue his journey home in the be&s;t manner he could. Stimulated with motives of revenge, he brought
<PB N="13" REF="034563_0007_0FFE2BA6F8082D60">
his action for damages again&s;t the commodore, and the affair was tried at the next a&s;&s;izes. Sev|eral witne&s;&s;es were examined, but as ill luck would have it, not one could prove a &s;ingle cir|cum&s;tance, &s;o that the attorney was non-&s;uited, to the no &s;mall plea&s;ure of many per&s;ons pre&s;ent, whom he had by his pernicious advice, led into vexatious law-&s;uits, and actually ruined, under pretence of promoting their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Their next exploit was much more diverting, and conducted by the very ingenious Tom Pipes. The hide of a large ox was made choice of, and being properly &s;tuffed, the jaw bone of a &s;hark was fixed to his face, with two large gla&s;s eyes. Within were &s;everal matches burning, which gave the whole the mo&s;t dreadful appearance, and this was fixed near the bedchamber of the commodore. No &s;ooner did the commodore &s;ee the dreadful apparition &s;pewing out blue fire, than he imagined him&s;elf in hell, for few people in the world are more &s;uper&s;tious than &s;eamen. His courage, however, did not for&s;ake him, for lifting up his &s;tick, he &s;truck it &s;uch a blow, that one of the horns was almo&s;t fractured. He then took to his heels, but could not run long, when he &s;unk down with fear; for he believed the artifi|cial apparition to be the devil. Tom Pipes, who beheld the whole, was not willing to lo&s;e any part of the diver&s;ion, and therefore ju&s;t as the commodore was beginning to &s;aint, he ran to|wards
<PB N="14" REF="034563_0008_0FFE2BAB6F2C7A20">
him and tripped up his heels. The com|modore being in &s;ome mea&s;ure recovered by his fears rather than the hope of delivery, called out in the mo&s;t vociferous manner, upon which the &s;ervants came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They found him in a cold &s;weat, for fear had in paired both his &s;en&s;es and faculties, &s;o that he was little better than a dead man. Hatchway endeavored to rai&s;e him up, and enquiring into the cau&s;e of his misfortune, was told by the commodore, that he had met Davy Jones (the name given by the &s;ailors to the devil) and that he knew him by his &s;aucer eyes. It is very remarkable, that of all injuries, tho&s;e that we receive in youth make the mo&s;t la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially when they are accompanied with circum&s;tances of an ag|gravating nature. It &s;eems that while the com|modore was only a &s;chool boy, he had been de|tected in &s;tealing deer, and being carried before a neighboring ju&s;tice, his wor&s;hip u&s;ed him in &s;o cruel a manner, that he was obliged to content him&s;elf with a place in the county goal. There he remained near a year, and his relations refu|&s;ing to do any thing for him, he was obliged to embrace the alternative, either to remain in pri&s;|on, or go on board of a &s;hip. He cho&s;e the lat|ter, and having undergone all tho&s;e hard&s;hips that are connected with naval affairs, he conceiv|ed the utmo&s;t aver&s;ion to all tho&s;e related to him, and refu&s;ed to have any connection with them for the future.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="034563_0008_0FFE2BAB6F2C7A20">
Peregrine, who was acquainted with every particular of this affair, told Hatchway and Pipes that he would have a notable piece of fun at his uncle's expen&s;e. The propo&s;al was reli&s;hed by the two confederates, and it was agreed up|on between them, that a proper per&s;on would be made choice of to come to the commodore with a forged letter, in the name of that relation, who of all the others, had u&s;ed him with the greate&s;t cruelty. The per&s;on made choice of for this purpo&s;e, was the exci&s;eman of the pari&s;h: and having received directions, he went one morning to the commodore, about <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> hours before the u&s;ual time of his getting up <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> The commodore &s;wore he would not come down till the u&s;ual time of turning out, but the exci&s;eman having told the &s;ervant that his bu&s;ine&s;s was of the mo&s;t urgent nature, he re&s;olved to comply.</P>
<P>Having crept out of his bed, he made &s;hift to crawl down &s;tairs, grumbling and cur&s;ing all the way for being di&s;turbed of his re&s;t. When he came into the parlor, the &s;uppo&s;ed rela|tion addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to him in all the ful&s;ome flattery that has an affect on weak minds; but the commodore, who did not reli&s;h any thing of that nature, de&s;ired him to give over his com|pliments, and come to the point at once.</P>
<P>Upon that the &s;tranger pre&s;ented him a letter, written, as he &s;aid, by that uncle who had u&s;ed him with &s;o much cruelty while he was in pri&s;on, for &s;tealing the deer; and to add the more to
<PB N="16" REF="034563_0009_0FFE2BB132FFF438">
the aggravation that it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion, he told him that he had been to him one of the kinde&s;t relations that ever lived.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cribe the perturbation of mind which the commodore felt, when he read the letter, and at la&s;t lo&s;ing all manner of pa|tience, he tore it into a thou&s;and pieces, and trod upon the fragments on the floor. He cur&s;ed all his relations to the lowe&s;t pit of hell, and declar|ed that he would not give one farthing, or the value of a rope's end, to keep them above board.</P>
<P>The exci&s;eman who was no &s;tranger to the character of the commodore, began to con&s;ider him&s;elf in perilous circum&s;tances, and therefore walked towards the door, in order to procure a retreat, not doubting but he would be able to make the commodore hearken to the voice of rea&s;on. He then told the commodore that he was one of the mo&s;t ungrateful wretches in the world, for u&s;ing his own relations in &s;o &s;hame|ful a manner, and concluded, by a&s;king him what he thought they would &s;ay of &s;uch un|natural behavior.</P>
<P>The commodore could conceal his re&s;entment no longer, and turning to Tom Pipes, ordered him to take his &s;uppo&s;ed relation to the gang way, and there give him a round dozen doubled. Tom, tho an accomplice in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> whole of the &s;cheme, yet obeyed his orders with dexterity and punctuality. He called on &s;ome of the &s;ervant&s;
<PB N="17" REF="034563_0009_0FFE2BB132FFF438">
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, who readily obeyed, and the poor gauger was conducted over the draw bridge to the yard, where he was tied to a &s;take, in order to undergo proper di&s;cipline. He &s;till imagined that Tom Pipes was in je&s;t, but that arch-rogue who was not too fond of what we call moral obligations, having tied him &s;o fa&s;t, that he could not well make his e&s;cape, went in &s;earch of a rope for the intended operation. When he ar|rived, the exci&s;eman told him that he hoped he was not in earne&s;t, to which Tom an&s;wered, he was very &s;orry for the part he was to act, but as his ma&s;ter's orders were ab&s;olute he was obliged to comply with them. He then undre&s;&s;ed the poor exci&s;eman, and gave him &s;uch a hearty flogging, that he cur&s;ed the day he had ever been engaged in &s;uch an undertaking, threatning at the &s;ame time to reveal the whole &s;cheme to the commodore. From doing that, however, he was prevented by Lieutenant Hatchway, who told him that if he made the affair public, he would be found guilty of perjury, for he had per&s;onated the name of a man with whom he was utterly unacquainted. This &s;erved to &s;i|lence the exci&s;eman, who as &s;oon as he was loo&s;ed from the po&s;t, took to his heels with the utmo&s;t expedition, and ran home to his wife, who waited for him with the utmo&s;t impatience.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;uch a &s;pecies of fraud and mi&s;chief, &s;hould be long carried on
<PB N="18" REF="034563_0010_0FFE2BB2CA8924C0">
without detection, and the commodore having revolved all the circumstances in his mind, charged young Perrigrine with it. At fir&s;t the boy denied the whole, but when he had received a &s;evere flogging, he made an ample confe&s;&s;ion, which &s;o much exa&s;perated the commodore, that he re&s;olved to turn Hatchway out of the ca&s;tle. But he had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to the &s;o|ciety of the lieutenant, as well as Pipes, that he could not live without them, &s;o that they were both freely forgiven.</P>
<P>In the mean time young Peregrine made &s;uch progre&s;s in learning, that it was propo&s;ed to &s;end him to &s;ome public &s;chool, and that of Winche&s;|ter was made choice of by his tutor, and approv|ed of by the commodore. Indeed the com|modore's lady had &s;everal rea&s;ons for wi&s;h|ing to get rid of our adventurer; for, be&s;ides his many knavi&s;h pranks, &s;he con&s;idered him as a &s;py on her conduct. Mr. Jolter, a reverend clergyman, of very high notions, was made choice of and recommended by the par&s;on of the pari&s;h to be tutor to young Peregrine. Jolter was not a bad &s;cholar, but he had lived &s;o long in a college, that his temper was &s;our|ed, &s;o that no per&s;on could have been made choice of more improper for &s;uperintending the education of a young gentleman. Tom Pipes, who had been long accu&s;tomed to jacket and trow&s;ers; was put into a &s;uit of decent livery, in order to attend our adventurer and par&s;on
<PB N="19" REF="034563_0010_0FFE2BB2CA8924C0">
Jolter as a footman. The commodore pro|po&s;ed, that they &s;hould &s;et out to take leave of the young gentleman's father, but the mother refu&s;ed to &s;ee him, &s;o unnatural was &s;he to her child, for rea&s;ons that no one could account for. The commodore, however, made up all that was wanting in the affections of the par|ents, for he adopted young Peregrine as his heir, and &s;ettled him at Winche&s;ter on the mo&s;t genteel footing. The commodore's lady made a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent to Mr. Jolter, as a reward for his piety, and Hatchway in&s;i&s;ted on &s;taying at the &s;chool along with Peregrine. He told the commodore, that he had &s;ome thoughts of learning the latin lingo, altho he did not at that time know the difference between a noun and a verb. The commodore expo&s;tulated with the lieutenant on the impropriety of thinking to learn latin at &s;uch a period of life, and as he could not bear the thought of living without him, he told him, that if he would re|turn to the ca&s;tle, he would give him leave to vi&s;it young Peregrine once every month. Hatch|way was not &s;uch a fool, but he could feel the force of what was &s;aid by the commodore, and therefore having given up all thoughts of learn|ing Latin, he took leave of our young gentle|man, tho not without &s;hedding tears. He &s;aid he was &s;ure the young dog had bewitched him, for he could not look at him without lov|ing him. Indeed there was &s;uch an hone&s;t &s;im|plicity
<PB N="20" REF="034563_0011_0FFE2BB4CA59E700">
in the lieutenant, that he thought well of all human raoe, and could not help loving &s;uch as were young.</P>
<P>Peregrine had not been long at the &s;chool, when his genius began to di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf in a mo&s;t con&s;picuous manner. His pupil was &s;uch an arrant pedant, that he &s;eemed a very proper object for him to exerci&s;e his ingenuity upon, and therefore be began by mixing brandy and other &s;trong liquors with his tea, &s;o that he was often intoxicated without knowing the cau&s;e. By &s;uch practices he brought the character of his tutor into the utmo&s;t contempt, and to complete the farce, Peregrine was cho&s;en <HI>Dux</HI> or head of a &s;elect number of boys, who re|&s;olved to &s;hake off all obedience to their tutors. The head ma&s;ter having received information of the proceedings, &s;ent for Mr. Jolter, and told him that he mu&s;t keep a more &s;trict watch over the morals of his pupil, otherwi&s;e he would corrupt one half of the boys in the &s;chool.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter was a good deal di&s;compo&s;ed when he received the information, but as nothing could be more ju&s;t or rea&s;onable, he went home, and called Peregrine into his room. He repeated to him the dangerous con&s;equences of &s;uch practices, and the di&s;grace he would bring upon him&s;elf and relations, unle&s;s there was &s;ome change in his conduct.</P>
<P>Peregrine, though a wild youth, was not de&s;ti|tute of good &s;en&s;e, and therefore &s;eeing the pro|priety
<PB N="21" REF="034563_0011_0FFE2BB4CA59E700">
of what was &s;aid by his tutor, he promi&s;|ed to be more obedient for the future.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter was &s;o overjoyed at this in&s;tance of his pulpil's docility, that he re&s;olved to improve it to the be&s;t advantage, and therefore propo&s;ed to him the &s;tudy of the mathematicks, as the only &s;cience that can enlarge the mind, by lead|ing it off from objects of a trifling nature. The young gentleman entered upon the &s;tudy with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure, but no &s;ooner had gone through the fir&s;t two books of Euclid than he became &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted with the whole &s;cience, that he declared he would not pur&s;ue it any further. In vain did Mr. Jolter remon&s;trate to his pupil on the great impropriety of his con|duct; the young gentleman remained inexorable, and nothing could induce him to proceed any further. Indeed he &s;hook off all manner of re|re&s;traint, he refu&s;ed to be obedient to his tutor any longer, upon which the head ma&s;ter de&s;ired Mr. Jolter to write to the commodore, that he might as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible remove Tom Pipes from attending on Peregrine, for that antiquated &s;eaman was now become a general nui&s;ance to the whole &s;chool.</P>
<P>The truth is, Tom Pipes was at the head of every &s;cene of mi&s;chief, and nothing &s;eemed to give him &s;o much plea&s;ure, as that of tor|menting his fellow creatures. He mingled in all their divir&s;ions, and decided in every contro|ver&s;y that aro&s;e between them. He regulated
<PB N="22" REF="034563_0012_0FFE2BB7D62D5E40">
their manual exerci&s;e by his whi&s;tle, and he pre|&s;cribed rules to each of them according to their different ages. Indeed Tom Pipes was in a man|ner become &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the boys, that it could be &s;uppo&s;ed that they would part with him with|out an in&s;urrection taking place. Peregrine was &s;en&s;ible of this, and therefore on promi&s;ing to be more circum&s;pect, in the re&s;t of his conduct, Pipes was allowed to continue at the &s;chool &s;ome|time longer. This, however, was a re&s;olution too good to la&s;t long, as will appear from the following incident.</P>
<P>One day Tom Pipes having conducted &s;ome of the boys to a garden in the &s;uburbs they were very rude in pulling the fruit, which &s;o enraged the gardner, that he came to them and demand|ed &s;atisfaction. The boys refu&s;ed to &s;atisfy his demands, upon which the great dog was let loo&s;e upon them, and in the &s;cuffle Peregrine lo&s;t his cap. The engagement now became general, the gardner called his apprentice to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, while Tom Pipes led on the in&s;urgents in battle array. The gardner, who was a &s;tout fellow, took his &s;tand at the turning of one of the aven|ues, and when Pipes advanced, he gave him &s;uch a blow on the head, that his &s;cull rung if it had been made of bell metal.</P>
<P>Pipes &s;oon recovered from the dreadful blow he had received, and darting his head into the bo&s;om of the gardner tumbled him into a trench, that he had newly digged, nor did it fare better
<PB N="23" REF="034563_0012_0FFE2BB7D62D5E40">
with the dog who coming up to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his ma&s;ter, laid hold of the calf of Tom Pipes' leg, and would have eaten it for his dinner, had not the &s;eamen turned about, and in an in&s;tant put a period to the exi&s;tence of the voracious an|imal.</P>
<P>The gardner was now &s;o much overpowered that he knew not what to do, and his wi&s;e hav|ing alarmed the neighborhood. Tom Pipes ad|vi&s;ed the &s;cholars to de&s;i&s;t, left they &s;hould be all apprehended and committed to pri&s;on. The &s;cholars complied with his reque&s;t, but as the gardner was rendered incapable of following his work, and as his children became chargeable to the pari&s;h, an enquiry was &s;et on &s;cot to find out the aggre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the enquiry was, that out ad|venturer was found to be at the head of this un|ruly mob of boys, and therefore it was ordered that he &s;hould undergo a &s;evere &s;lugging, and a day was appointed for the execution of this &s;olemn decree.</P>
<P>The thoughts of being di&s;graced in this manner was what he could not bear, and there|fore, he re&s;olved to make an elopement from the &s;chool. He communicated his intentions to &s;ome of the mo&s;t active of the &s;cholars, and when the time arrived that he was to receive the threatened di&s;cipline, they came with him into the &s;chool, and demanded of the ma&s;ter that he &s;hould in&s;tantly be forgiven. The ma&s;ter,
<PB N="24" REF="034563_0013_0FFE2BBD95375DB0">
however, behaved with that dignity becoming his &s;tation, and Peregrine, notwith&s;tanding his profe&s;&s;ions of courage, was hor&s;ed and whipped, to the terror of all others, who &s;hould for the fu|ture offend in the like manner, this di&s;grace had &s;uch an effect upon him, that he re&s;olved to de|tach him&s;elf from his di&s;orderly companions, and apply him&s;elf in good earne&s;t to his &s;tud|ies. He was now above fourteen years of age, &amp; in &s;tature and &s;hape one of the fine&s;t figures that ever was &s;een. The young ladies began to take notice of him, and there being a ball one even|ing he went to dance at it, as is the practice with young gentlemen.</P>
<P>While he was waiting for the company, the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies took notice of him, and &s;ingled out for him a partner, a young lady who&s;e name was Emilia Gauntlet, and &s;i&s;ter to a young gentleman who happened to be there at the &s;ame time. The young lady was extremely hand&s;ome, and her exterior appearance was &s;et off by all the improvements that the intellectual faculties can receive. When the ball was over our hero returned to his lodgings, but he could not &s;leep during the whole of the night. In the morning he aro&s;e, and having dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the mo&s;t agreeable manner, he went to the lodg|ings of Mi&s;s Gauntlet, and was &s;hown into the parlor. Emilia made her appearance in the mo&s;t enchanting dre&s;s; and the pa&s;&s;ions of our hero were now wound up to the highe&s;t pitch. The
<PB N="25" REF="034563_0013_0FFE2BBD95375DB0">
mother of the young lady was &s;till in bed, and when &s;he got up &s;he &s;eemed to look upon Pere|grine in no very favorable light, for &s;he con&s;ider|ed him in no other light than a young &s;park who wanted to make him&s;elf merry at the expen&s;e of &s;uch young females as are weak enough to heark|en to their &s;olicitations.</P>
<P>The young lady treated him with all the in|dulgence &s;he po&s;&s;ibly could, con&s;i&s;tent with the regard &s;he ought to have had for her own char|acter, and invited him to vi&s;it her from time to time at her mother's hou&s;e, which was only a few miles di&s;tant. This was ju&s;t what he wi&s;hed for, and in the mid&s;t of his mutual embraces, he declared to her, that his pa&s;&s;ion was the mo&s;t pure that ever took place in the human brea&s;t. Being obliged to take leave of his charmer, he re|turned to &s;chool, but became &s;o pen&s;ive and mel|ancholy, that all his former acquaintance began to &s;hun his company. At la&s;t he re&s;olved to elope, and having tied up a bundle of linen, with other nece&s;&s;aries, he gave it to Tom Pipes, and next morning they both &s;et out together on foot, for the village where the mother of Emilia lived.</P>
<P>When he came to the village, he took lodg|ings at an inn, and leaving Tom Pipes to take care of his baggage, he &s;et out for the hou&s;e where his charmer re&s;ided, &s;truggling under all that anxiety of mind that generally takes place in the brea&s;t of a lover.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="034563_0014_0FFE2BBF215F2AC8">
When he came to the gate, he was &s;o much taken up with the thoughts of the young lady, that when &s;he made her appearance he &s;carce knew her; for his mind was tortured with all the variety of di&s;cordant pa&s;&s;ion. She received him in the mo&s;t complai&s;ant manner, and con|ducted him to the parlor, where her mother was then &s;itting drinking tea. This was a more fa|vorable reception than he had any rea&s;on to ex|pect; but every thing &s;ucceeding &s;o far accord|ing to his wi&s;h, it was propo&s;ed that he and the young lady &s;hould take a walk together till tow|ards evening. Upon their return the mother invited Peregrine to &s;upper, and the young lov|ers being left alone, many tender things pa&s;&s;ed between them. He prote&s;ted in the mo&s;t &s;ol|emn manner that he loved her above every one he had ever &s;een; while &s;he on her part chid him gently for running away from &s;chool. In this &s;he was &s;econded by her mother, who&s;e circum|&s;tances had taught her prudence; for &s;he was the widow of a general officer who had lo&s;t his life in the &s;ervice of his country, and had left his &s;on in the humble &s;tation of a volunteer, wait|ing for the intere&s;t of &s;ome great man to be&s;tow upon him a commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>While he remained under the influence of this &s;weet intoxication, his ab&s;ence occa&s;ioned no &s;mall di&s;turbance at Winche&s;ter, and Mr. Jolter wrote to the commodore, giving him an account of his elopement. The poor old commodore re|ceived
<PB N="27" REF="034563_0014_0FFE2BBF215F2AC8">
the news of the elopement with the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, and cur&s;ed Hatchway and Tom Pipes, for having debauched the boy's mind, by leading him off from a &s;en&s;e of his duty. Nor did he &s;pare Jolter, whom he called an old doating fool, becau&s;e he did not keep a better look out, to prevent Peregrine from foundering. He im|mediately di&s;patched expre&s;&s;es to all the &s;ea-ports on the coa&s;t, to prevent his going abroad, while Lieutenant Hatchway was di&s;patched acro&s;s the country, to make all the enquiries he could con|cerning the young fugitive. Hatchway &s;pent four days without receiving any intelligence, when being benighted, he took up his lodgings at a village, where he had not regaled him&s;elf long, when he heard the voice of his old friend Tom Pipes, entertaining a company of ru&s;tics with a &s;ong in true &s;ea language. Hatchway flung his pipe into the chimney corner, and gra&s;ping a pi&s;tol in his hand, went to the room where Pipes was, and &s;wore that he would blow his brains out, unle&s;s he produced young Pere|grine. Pipes, not in the lea&s;t intimidated, told the lieutenant, that Peregrine was as &s;afe as a roach, and that he would produce him as &s;oon as he had fini&s;hed his &s;ong. Hatchway could not have any objection to this propo&s;al, and Tom having fini&s;hed his &s;ong, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the com|pany, the two old me&s;s mates retired to another room. There Pipes recited to the lieutenant every circum&s;tance relating to the elopement,
<PB N="28" REF="034563_0015_0FFE2BC0EF9198D8">
and before they had done &s;peaking, Peregrine came in from his mi&s;tre&s;s with whom he had &s;pent the evening. Hatchway was overjoyed to &s;ee his long lo&s;t young ma&s;ter, but much more &s;o, when he found that he was &s;en&s;ible of his folly in running away from &s;chool, and vexing his generous friend the commodore. At la&s;t, it was agreed that they &s;hould &s;et out the next morning for Winche&s;ter, and in the mean time Peregrine went to take leave of his mi&s;tre&s;s. Their parting was truly affecting, but as there was nece&s;&s;ity for it, the young lady pretended to make no objections, while her mother &s;aid all &s;he could in favor of parental authority, and next morning our hero returned to Winche&s;ter, where he was received in the mo&s;t kindly manner, by Par&s;on Jolter his tutor.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of the &s;chool forgave him on ac|count of his youth, but when Hatchway returned to the garri&s;on, and told the whole of the cir|cum&s;tances to the commodore, the old gentle|man was very much grieved, e&s;pecially when he began to con&s;ider that there was a young lady in the ca&s;e. He re&s;olved therefore to lay the whole of the affair before Mr. Pickle, his father, that proper mea&s;ures might be concerted, in or|der to prevent his ruin. In the mean time, Peregrine &s;ent a love epi&s;tle to his mi&s;tre&s;s, and concluded, by telling her, that he would never place his affections on any other object. This letter was &s;ent by the hands of the faithful Tom
<PB N="29" REF="034563_0015_0FFE2BC0EF9198D8">
Pipes, with &s;trict orders that it &s;hould be delivered into her own hands, without communicating the contents to any per&s;on whatever be&s;ides her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Tom Pipes being thus employed as amba&s;&s;a|dor, took his place on the box of a &s;tage coach, and that the letter might not be lo&s;t, he put it be|tween the &s;ole of his &s;hoe and &s;tocking. This was very con&s;i&s;tent with his own vulgar ideas, but no &s;ooner did he come to the inn, than feel|ing for the letter, he found that by the motion of the coach, it was all torn in pieces. This was a mo&s;t &s;hocking circum&s;tance for poor Tom Pipes, who cur&s;ed both the coachman and the coach. There was, however, no time to be lo&s;t, and, therefore, after &s;ome reflection, he re&s;olved to &s;end for the clerk of the pari&s;h, and get him to write a letter of a &s;imilar nature.</P>
<P>Accordingly, Tom went in que&s;t of the &s;chool|ma&s;ter, who was one of the mo&s;t arrant pedants that ever lived, and bringing him to the inn, got him to write a letter in that &s;tile which tho&s;e of his fraternity call the true &s;ublime. Pipes was &s;o much overjoyed when he heard it read, that he could not refrain from &s;queezing the peda|gogue by the hand, telling him at the &s;ame time, that it was light in its timbers, and would forev|er remain above water. Flu&s;hed with the hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, he &s;et out for the hou&s;e where the young lady re&s;ided, not doubting but he would meet with a favorable reception, but when &s;he had read the non&s;en&s;ical epi&s;tle, &s;he concluded
<PB N="30" REF="034563_0016_0FFE2BC2AE620600">
that either her lover was mad, or that he had &s;ent the letter with no other view, than to make her an object of ridicule.</P>
<P>Pipes, who doubted not but he would receive a favorable an&s;wer, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with vi&s;ible marks of contempt, and next day he arrived at Winche&s;ter. Peregrine, who had waited for his return with the utmo&s;t impatience, no &s;ooner &s;aw him, than he reached out his hand for a let|ter, but being informed that he had none, he im|mediately concluded, that Emilia had not an op|portunity to write, and therefore he re&s;olved to wait the return of the po&s;t. But as he did not receive any an&s;wer during the whole of the en|&s;uing week, his pride was &s;ummoned up to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and he began to de&s;pi&s;e the woman whom he imagined had treated him with &s;o much indignity.</P>
<P>His behavior &s;oon reached the ears of the young lady's mother, and from that circum|&s;tance &s;he was convinced that he was the &s;ame coxcomb as he had repre&s;ented him&s;elf in his letter. She therefore ordered her daughter not to think any more of him&punc; and thus a youthful corre&s;pon|dence was broken off merely by the conduct of Pipes, who took no more notice of it than if he had been a&s;&s;i&s;ting in pumping a &s;hip, or prevent|ing one from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>While things were going on in this manner, the commodore, who never lo&s;t &s;ight of the in|tere&s;t of young Peregrine, con&s;ulted the par&s;on
<PB N="31" REF="034563_0016_0FFE2BC2AE620600">
of the pari&s;h concerning the mo&s;t proper means to be u&s;ed, and at la&s;t it was agreed upon between them, that he &s;hould be taken from the &s;chool, and &s;ent to the univer&s;ity. Accordingly he was &s;ent for home along with his tutor, Mr. Jolter, who had not, during the whole time he was at Winche&s;ter, taught him any thing that could contribute towards promoting his intere&s;t. Mr. Pickle no &s;ooner &s;aw his &s;on, than he be|&s;towed a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings on the commo|dore, for having been at &s;o much expence in his education, but his mother was of a different opinion, for &s;he had conceived &s;uch an inveterate hatred to her elde&s;t &s;on, that &s;he loked upon him as an object of dete&s;tation. She ordered that none of the &s;ervants &s;hould for the future grant him admittance to the hou&s;e, which &s;o much ex|a&s;perated Hatchway, that he &s;wore he would be revenged on her one way or other. Indeed, it is not to be wondered at, for the hone&s;t lieuten|ant imagined that every one was as innocent as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The commodore, who under an out&s;ide of &s;avage ru&s;ticity, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed real goodne&s;s of heart, could not hear with indifference the manner in which Mr. Pickle u&s;ed his &s;on, and therefore having be&s;towed a volley of cur&s;es upon the whole family, he took Peregrine home along with him to the ca&s;tle. It was then re&s;olved, that our young adventurer &s;hould be &s;ent to the uni|ver&s;ity along with Mr. Jolter, who was &s;till to act
<PB N="32" REF="034563_0017_0FFE2BC5A9188200">
the part of his tutor; but he had not been long at Oxford, when he di&s;covered &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition for &s;atire, that every one of the young nobility and gentry courted his frend&s;hip, not doubting but they would be able to make his ingenuity &s;ub&s;ervient to their purpo&s;es. Mr. Jolter, who had the intere&s;t of Peregrine entirely at heart, in order to divert him from &s;uch practices, in|troduced him to the company of a club of poli|ticians, who were reputed men of knowledge and probity, and who &s;pent the evenings in animad|verting on the conduct of the mini&s;try, and hatch|ing &s;chemes for overturning the government both in church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that a youth &s;o vola|tile as Peregrine, would be much delighted with the company of men, who in&s;tead of &s;peaking con&s;i&s;tant with their characters as rational crea|tures, were like an a&s;&s;embly of quakers, or rather of &s;uperannuated or melancholy cats. Indeed, he looked upon them in &s;o mean and contemptible a light, that he &s;oon began to de&s;pi&s;e them, and one night having made them all drunk, he &s;tart|ed a topic of argument that irritated their pa&s;|&s;ions &s;o much that they got to loggerheads, bottles and gla&s;&s;es, which &s;lew about in &s;uch abundance, that &s;carce one in the company could make his e&s;cape without receving a mark that would put him in mind of the nocturnal adventure.</P>
<P>The uproar was &s;o great that the whole neighborhood was alarmed, and ju&s;t at that in|&s;tant,
<PB N="33" REF="034563_0017_0FFE2BC5A9188200">
the proctor happening to be returning to his chamber, took them all into cu&s;tody, except Mr. Jolter, who made his e&s;cape at the ex|pence of a couple of black eyes. Next morning he was &s;ummoned to attend the proctor, in order to an&s;wer for his conduct, which frightened him con&s;iderably, but Peregrine, who was an arch wag, told him that he would, by the help of a cer|tain paint, hide the circles around his eyes, to which Jolter &s;ubmitted, but when he made his appearance, the fraud was di&s;covered, and he re|ceived a &s;evere reprimand.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time Par&s;on Jolter was &s;o much mor|tified, that he &s;carce knew how to appear in pub|lic, and not doubting but Peregrine had a princi|pal &s;hare in the whole &s;cheme, he could not re|frain from &s;howing marks of his re&s;entment. This was what the proud &s;pirit of our adventurer could not bear, and therefore in revenge for the in&s;olence of his tutor, he wrote a copy of ver&s;es again&s;t him, in &s;uch &s;atirical language, that poor Jolter he&s;itated, whether he &s;hould not lay out his la&s;t &s;hilling, in the purcha&s;e of a rope, in or|der to deprive the hangman of his <HI>legal</HI> wages.</P>
<P>Peregrine often u&s;ed to make excur&s;ions to dif|ferent parts of the country, particularly Wind&s;or, where while he was one day walking along with a fellow collegian, he di&s;covered Emilia, and made up to her. The young lady had not for|gotton the in&s;ult offered her in the odious letter, written by the pari&s;h clerk, at the in&s;tigation of
<PB N="34" REF="034563_0018_0FFE2BCBD0999A70">
Tom Pipes, and therefore &s;he treated him in a cold formal manner. She refu&s;ed to hear any thing that he had to &s;ay in his defence; but after &s;everal &s;olicitations, &s;he agreed to honor him with an interview, during which time the whole my&s;tery was cleared up, and a mutual reconcili|ation took place, though not before the amiable young lady procured a free pardon for poor Pipes and the pedantic clerk. In the mean time, his long ab&s;ence from Oxford, gave great unea&s;i|ne&s;s to Mr. Jolter, who with all his faults, &s;till wi&s;hed his pulpil well, and therefore having learn|ed the name of the young gentleman with whom he had made the excur&s;ion to Wind&s;or, he went to his chambers, and was told that Peregrine was &s;till at Win&s;or along with Mi&s;s Emilia Gauntlet, and that it would be no ea&s;y matter to di&s;engage them from each other.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of that information, Mr. Jol|ter &s;et out for Win&s;or, where he met with his pulpil, and remon&s;trated to him on the impro|priety of his conduct. This put Peregrine into a mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion, and high words aro&s;e be+tween him and his tutor. Mr. Jolter could ne|ver forgive Peregrine for the part he had acted, in making him &s;o ridiculous at the political club; and, although he was under many obligations to the commodore, yet he would have given up his charge, had he not been in expectation of re|ceiving a rich living, which the aged naval officer was expected to have in his power, to pre&s;ent
<PB N="35" REF="034563_0018_0FFE2BCBD0999A70">
him to, after the death of an incumbent, who was then far advanced in years. The thoughts of &s;uch a valuable acqui&s;ition made him keep his pa&s;&s;ions under proper re&s;traint, and although often in&s;ulted by Peregrine, yet he re&s;olved to di&s;&s;emble his re&s;entment, till &s;uch time as he was properly provided for.</P>
<P>Peregrine was &s;o much exa&s;perated at the conduct of his tutor, that he wrote a letter to his aunt, and in an&s;wer received one which mortified his pride to the utmo&s;t. She told him, that the commodore had all along treat|ed him with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s, and that it was his duty to be obedient to him in every thing, but this &s;o far from bringing his pa&s;|&s;ions under the government of rea&s;on, only &s;erv|ed to inflame them the more, and therefore be wrote a letter in the mo&s;t polite &s;tile to the commodore, attempting to ridicule his conduct by throwing the whole blame upon Jolter, whom he accu&s;ed of tyrrany and partiality.</P>
<P>The commodore, who knew no other phra&s;es than &s;uch as were made u&s;e of at &s;ea, wrote Peregrine an an&s;wer, wherein he told him, that if he would be a good boy, he would take him into favor, but if he continued refractory, he would di&s;card him forever.</P>
<P>Hatchway, who had been di&s;patched with this letter to Peregrine, &s;aid all he could to per&s;uade the young gentleman to comply with the com|modore's reque&s;t, and in order to prevail with
<PB N="36" REF="034563_0019_0FFE2BCDD2A50A70">
him, told him, that if he had &s;educed the young lady, he was willing to take her off his hands. Hatchway had &s;trict orders to bring our young hero home to the ca&s;tle, but no &s;ooner had he mentioned the affair to him, than Peregrine &s;tart|ed up, and declared his re&s;olution that no per&s;on &s;hould compel him to comply with a propo&s;al &s;o contrary to his inclination. Hatchway was &s;o much irritated at what Peregrine &s;aid, that he tripped up his heels, and laid him flat on the floor, calling him at the &s;ame time one of the mo&s;t &s;aucy boys that ever walked between &s;tem and &s;tern. Peregrine would have dropped all man|ner of altercation with one whom he loved for the hone&s;t &s;implicity of his manners, but noth|ing would &s;erve the lieutenant, unle&s;s, he would fight him with &s;word and pi&s;tols. The place made choice of for the deciding this impor|tant quarrel, was Wind&s;or fore&s;t, to which our two combatants walked, but in their way thith|er, they were met by Tom Pipes, who armed him&s;elf with a large wooden cudgel. As Pipes had the utmo&s;t re&s;pect for the lieutenant, with whom he had &s;erved many years on board, and as he really wi&s;hed well to young Pere|grine, &s;o he re&s;olved to prevent any mi&s;chief that &s;hould happen, and in con&s;equence of that re&s;olution, brought both parties to agree to|gether, and the commodore wrote a very feeling letter to Peregrine, promi&s;ing him that nothing
<PB N="37" REF="034563_0019_0FFE2BCDD2A50A70">
&s;hould be wanting to promote his intere&s;t for the future.</P>
<P>When Peregrine had viewed the commo|dore's letter, he was &s;o much chagrined, that he became for &s;ome weeks a perfect &s;lave to melancholy, but the impetuo&s;ity of his pa&s;&s;ions getting the better of every thing, he re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ert his dignity as a rational creature, and not to be any longer the dupe of a family, who &s;eem|ed to &s;eek the promotion of his intere&s;t no far|ther than was con&s;i&s;tant with their own inclina|tions. Stimulated by motives of re&s;entment again&s;t Hatchway, and &s;till a captive to love, he went to vi&s;it his charmer, not doubting but her conver&s;ation would contribute towards &s;ub|bing off that ru&s;ticity that he had con|tracted during the melancholy under which he had labored. He told her that his uncle the commodore had propo&s;ed that he &s;hould make the tour of Europe, and he could not help expa|tiating on the plea&s;ures that he would enjoy in the volatile court of Paris, where nothing le&s;s than intrigue and gallantry could make a di&s;tingui&s;h|ing figure.</P>
<P>The young lady heard him with emotion, nor was it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> her power to prevent the tears from dropping down from her lovely eyes, e&s;pecially when &s;he was told that the commodore was of|fended at their meeting &s;o often together. To remove all her &s;cruples, he told her that he would be hers to the late&s;t period of his exi&s;tence, and
<PB N="38" REF="034563_0020_0FFE2BCFA1490AB8">
at the &s;ame time endeavored to convince her of the nece&s;&s;ity he was under of paying an implicit obedience to his uncle's commands. The young lady could not help feeling in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner the force of what he advanced, and there|fore compo&s;ing her&s;elf, &s;he told him that &s;he was perfectly &s;atisfied, and that for the future &s;he would not object to any part of his conduct, un|le&s;s by &s;ome fre&s;h action of his infidelity he &s;hould give her occa&s;ion to do &s;o. Every thing being thus &s;ettled in the mo&s;t amicable manner, the young lady took her leave, and our hero, who re|&s;olved to comply with his uncle's reque&s;t, di&s;|patched the lieutenant and par&s;on Jolter to the ca&s;tle, to inform the commodore, that as &s;oon as he had &s;ettled a few trifling things among his fel|low collegians, he would return, and comply with every thing that he had propo&s;ed for him, with re&s;pect to the regulation of his future con|duct particularly, and making the tower of Eu|rope.</P>
<P>In his journey to the ca&s;tle he took Emilia along with him part of the way, and on the even|ing of the fir&s;t day they took up their lodgings at a country inn, which at that time was crowd|ed with great numbers of people, who had been at a neighboring fair, and were now regaling them&s;elves with beer and tobacco. This was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> circum&s;tance that our lovers were obliged to put up with: but in the middle of the night they were alarmed with the cry of fire; and, upon inquiry was found that the country people, having <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="39" REF="034563_0020_0FFE2BCFA1490AB8">
drunk, had left &s;ome candles burning, &s;o that two of the galleries were in&s;tantly in a flame. Pere|grine and Tom Pipes &s;tarted up in an in&s;tant, and &s;aved the young lady as well her compan|ion; and &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted was poor Tom, that he refu&s;ed to accept of a reward which they ge|nerou&s;ly offered him.</P>
<P>Next day they arrived at the hou&s;e where the young lady's mother lived, but her brother had no &s;ooner &s;een our hero, than he con&s;idered him as one who had a de&s;ign to injure his &s;i&s;ter, and therefore treated him in the mo&s;t haughty man|ner. This was more than Peregrine would have bore with from any other per&s;on, but the love he had for Emilia induced him to conceal his re|&s;entment. The young lady, who could not di&s;|&s;emble her pa&s;&s;ion for him any longer, gave him a ring to keep as a token of her love, which plea|&s;ed him &s;o much that he embraced her with all the ardour of the mo&s;t tender affection, and next morning &s;et out on his journey.</P>
<P>He had not however proceeded far on his jour|ney, when at the end of a lane he was met by Godfrey, the brother of the young lady, and commanded to &s;top till he had given him the &s;at|isfaction of a gentleman. For &s;ome time Pere|grine in&s;ulted him on account of his poverty, and told him in plain terms, if he did not go in|&s;tantly about his bu&s;ine&s;s, he would order his footman, Tom Pipes, to give him a mo&s;t hearty drubbing. This la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion &s;o much exa&s;|perated Godfrey, that he drew his &s;word, &s;o that
<PB N="40" REF="034563_0021_0FFE2BD6D6C15CF8">
our hero was obliged to do the &s;ame, and a furi|ous combat en&s;ued. Each of the contending par|ties were wounded, but Peregrine having broken his &s;word, the other refu&s;ed to take any advan|tage of him; but, leaving him, told him, that for the future he mu&s;t never in&s;ult any gentleman on account of his poverty.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who with his foibles had a large &s;hare or humanity, no &s;ooner heard the la&s;t words uttered by the young gentleman than he was &s;truck with remor&s;e, for having treated him &s;o di&s;re&s;pectfully, and therefore going up to him de|&s;ired that he would alight from his hor&s;e, till he &s;hould have an opportunity of explaining his &s;en|timents. The young gentleman, who was no more than a cadet in the army, though the &s;on of a general officer, &s;uppo&s;ed he wanted to fini&s;h the combat, and therefore alighting, walked with him into a room, where he expected he would pre&s;ent him with a brace of pi&s;tols. But how great was his &s;urpri&s;e when Peregrine gave him to under&s;tand, that he was willing to do any thing to promote his intere&s;t, and that his pa&s;&s;ion for his &s;i&s;ter was the mo&s;t pure that could be im|agined. He added that he was going to &s;et out for France, and Godfrey having promi&s;ed to meet him at the commodore's, they both parted on the mo&s;t friendly terms.</P>
<P>The commodore was now turned of &s;eventy, and &s;o much crippled by the gout, that he was &s;carce able to &s;tir abroad. Mr. Pickle, his broth|er in-law, gave him but very little of his com|pany,
<PB N="41" REF="034563_0021_0FFE2BD6D6C15CF8">
&s;o that the old gentleman was, in a man|ner, re&s;tored to a new &s;tate of life, in con&s;equence of having young Peregrine once more to attend him. Gamaliel, the younger brother of Pere|grine, was now about fifteen years of age, but of &s;uch perver&s;e di&s;po&s;ition, that altho his mother con&s;idered him as her favorite, yet every one in the hou&s;e, as well as in the neighborhood, treated him with the mo&s;t &s;overeign contempt.</P>
<P>One day while young Gamaliel was riding out along with his tutor, the curate of the pari&s;h, Peregrine happened to come in &s;ight, and Gam|aliel who had been taught to offer him all the in|dignities he could, rode up again&s;t him, in or|der to unhor&s;e him. Peregrine, who gue&s;&s;ed his intention, acted in &s;o &s;pirited a manner, that young Gamaliel was flung from his hor&s;e, and before he had time to recover him&s;elf; Peregrine di&s;mounted, and gave the curate &s;uch a hearty drubbing, that he was not able, for &s;everal weeks after, to make his appearance in the church, &s;o that he was obliged to &s;ay, "Lord have mercy upon us," at home.</P>
<P>Complaints were made to the commodore not the good old &s;eaman, in&s;tead of paying any re|gard to them, declared that he wi&s;hed young Gamaliel had broke his neck, &s;o as Peregrine was out of the &s;crape.</P>
<P>As Peregrine could not put up calmy with the affront that had been offered him by the curate, &s;o he re&s;olved to take a &s;evere revenge on that
<PB N="42" REF="034563_0022_0FFE2BD860AD95D8">
reverend gentleman. Accordingly he and Hatch|way &s;et out for the alehou&s;e where the curate &s;pent his evenings, and having engaged a par|lor for them&s;elves, the lieutenant was placed to keep a good look, while Peregrine, who was an excellent mimic, went into the yard, and per&s;on|ated a dialogue between the curate and the wi&s;e of the publican. It was not long before the landlord heard what pa&s;&s;ed, and concluding that his &s;pou&s;e was gone into the barn with the prie&s;t, he ran thither in &s;earch of the adulterers, while Peregrine got in at the window, and &s;et down in the mo&s;t demure manner with Hatchway. As the poor publican was too much agitated to &s;eek for his wife in the barn, he left the door open, and returned to the hou&s;e, where he &s;aw her go in at another door. His &s;u&s;picions were now fully confirmed, but much more &s;o when he heard Hatchway in his arch leering manner, tell him that he believed the curate of the pari&s;h had &s;ome regard for his wife.</P>
<P>A few days after this, in order to carry on the farce &s;omewhat farther, at the expence of the curate, a boy was di&s;patched to inform that rev|erend gentleman that the publican's wife was extremely ill, and that &s;he could not bear the thoughts of dying without &s;peaking with him. The curate obeyed the &s;ummons; and, in the mean time Peregrine, with Hatchway, went to the place as u&s;ual, where they had not been long, when our young hero told the publican, that the par&s;on was ju&s;t gone in at a private door to the
<PB N="43" REF="034563_0022_0FFE2BD860AD95D8">
kitchen. This was more than the publican could bear; and therefore, not doubting but he would meet with the curate at the end of one of the lanes in his return, went into the barn, and arm|ed him&s;elf with a flail. From thence he &s;et out to the place where he expected to meet him, and &s;eeing him come up he extended the flail, which if it had done the execution, there would have been a new place for another poor prie&s;t. Ex|a&s;perated that he had not felled the prie&s;t to the ground, the publican once more extended the flail, but a &s;econd time mi&s;&s;ing his aim, he &s;truck him&s;elf on the head &s;uch a terrible blow, that for &s;ome time he &s;taggered in the &s;ame manner as he had often &s;een &s;ome of his cu&s;tomers do. In the mean time the curate, who imagined that he had been be&s;et by &s;ome robber, gra&s;ped his cudgel and took to his heels, but the publican getting up, pur&s;ued him, and gave him &s;uch a drubbing, that had not &s;ome laborers come up to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he would have inevitably per|i&s;hed.</P>
<P>Hatchway and Peregrine &s;at waiting in the parlor till the landlord arrived, and &s;eeing the marks of his encounter upon him, they began to make them&s;elves very merry at his expence. He could not conceal from them the manner in which he had treated the curate, whom he called a pari&s;h bull, let loo&s;e upon the wives of all the hone&s;t men in the neighborhood.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce done &s;peaking, when his wife came in, and told him, that &s;ome waggi&s;h boy
<PB N="44" REF="034563_0023_0FFE2BDA3243C088">
had &s;ent Mr. Sackbut, the par&s;on of the pari&s;h, to pray with her. The publican, who&s;e jealou&s;y was now wound up to the highe&s;t pitch, could conceal his indignation no longer, and therefore turning to his wife, told her, that he had di&s;a|bled the par&s;on from praying with her for &s;ome time. This was what the publican's wife could not bear, and therefore ca&s;ting a look of ineffable contempt on her hu&s;band, told him that he had no bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;it in company with gentlemen, while the company in the kitchen wanted his at|tendance. It was in vain for the poor henpeck|ed hu&s;band to make any reply, for knowing the &s;uperiority that his wife had over him, he left the room, and went to obey her orders. Next day it was reported throughout the pari&s;h, that Mr. Sackbut had been attacked by footpads and al|mo&s;t murdered, and an adverti&s;ement was affix|ed to the church door, offering a reward to tho&s;e who would make a di&s;covery, but no per&s;on came to claim it, &s;o that the poor par&s;on was obliged to put up with his drubbing.</P>
<P>It was not long before the curate began to &s;u&s;|pect that the whole was a &s;cheme projected by Peregrine, for he knew that the whole country could not produce &s;uch two cunning rogues as Hatchway and Mr. Thomas Pipes, under who&s;e direction our young hero acted. He therefore re&s;olved to be revenged on Peregrine, and im|parted his &s;cheme to young Gam. his pupil, but as good luck would have it, the &s;i&s;ter of Pere|grine, an amiable young lady, overheard the
<PB N="45" REF="034563_0023_0FFE2BDA3243C088">
whole of their conver&s;ation, and communicated it to a young gentleman, who was in love with her; and who gave, by her direction, an account of it to Peregrine.</P>
<P>To counteract this diabolical &s;cheme, it was propo&s;ed that a per&s;on &s;hould be &s;et to watch in an adjacent field, in order to give them an ac|count at what time the con&s;piritors came up. One whole evening was &s;pent in vain, for none of them came up, but on the &s;econd the me&s;&s;enger came to the ca&s;tle, and informed the lieutenant that three men were &s;kulking behind a hedge near the road that led to the public hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This news was no &s;ooner told, than the com|pany &s;allied forth, in order to wreck their ven|geance on the curate and his pupil, but when they came to the place, they found young Mr. Gauntlet the brother of Emily, exerci&s;ing his cudgel on a fellow whom he had got down. Pe|regrine, with the re&s;t of the company, ran to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and having taken the fellow pri&s;oner, conducted him to the ca&s;tle along with the young gentleman, who had left his hor&s;e at the inn. The pri&s;oner being brought before the commo|dore, confe&s;&s;ed that he had been employed by the curate of the pari&s;h, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Peregrine, upon which he was &s;uffered to go about his bu&s;ine&s;s, to the great mortification of Pipes, who wanted to give him a round dozen at the gang way.</P>
<P>The commodore treated young Gauntlet with every mark of re&s;pect, and one day, in the cour&s;e of their conver&s;ation together, di&s;covered that
<PB N="46" REF="034563_0024_0FFE2BDBF9003960">
he had been formerly acquainted with his father, who at that time was only a lieutenant of mar|ines, tho an officer of experienced conduct.</P>
<P>Young Gauntlet had &s;uch &s;crupulous notions of honor, that before the commodore could pre|vail on him to accept of as much money as would purcha&s;e a commi&s;&s;ion, he was obliged to tell him that he was &s;o much indebted to his father, but not knowing what was become of him, had never till then an opportunity of re|paying it. The&s;e things being &s;ettled, and French &s;ervants hired to attend our young hero in his intended tour, Gauntlet left the ca&s;tle, and the commodore ordered that Tom Pipes &s;hould re|main at home, becau&s;e he was ignorant of the French lingo. Before Peregrine &s;et out, he re|ceived a letter from his &s;i&s;ter, informing him that &s;he would meet him at a cottage near her father's hou&s;e, in order to conver&s;e with him on &s;ome things of Importance.</P>
<P>He obeyed the &s;ummons, and when he came to the place, found his &s;i&s;ter, and was &s;urpri&s;ed to find her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o many accompli&s;hments beyond what he expected. He propo&s;ed taking her away from her unnatural parents, but be|fore he had done &s;peaking, his mother, who had placed &s;pies on her daughter, ru&s;hed into the apartment, and would have torn the poor young lady to pieces, had not Peregrine interpo&s;ed in her defence. The mother was &s;o tran&s;ported with rage that &s;he &s;eemed like a bedlamite, and when Peregrine began to expo&s;tulate with her in
<PB N="47" REF="034563_0024_0FFE2BDBF9003960">
favor of his &s;i&s;ter, &s;he declared that for the fu|ture &s;he &s;hould never be admitted into her father's hou&s;e. Peregrine was much troubled in what manner he &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of his &s;i&s;ter, but find|ing no other method of providing for her than putting her under the protection of his generous benefactor&punc; he took her home to the ca&s;tle, where &s;he met with a welcome reception from the com|modore. Old Pickle was obliged to comply with the dictates of his wife, which &s;o enraged the commodore, that he &s;ent him a challenge, but the other had no intention of accepting it. Hatchway however, was extremely unwilling to lo&s;e a little fun, and therefore returning to the ca&s;tle, told the commodore that old Mr. Pickle would meet him.</P>
<P>As the commodore never knew what it was to he afraid to fight, he re&s;olved to go, and in the mean time it was propo&s;ed that young Peregrine &s;hould per&s;onate his father, and mimic his voice. A real farce en&s;ued, and the poor commodore was defeated without knowing that the conquer|or was his god&s;on.</P>
<P>The time for his departure drawing nigh, Mr. Jolter was made choice of to attend him as a tu|tor, and having taken leave of his friends at the ca&s;tle, he &s;et out in a po&s;t chai&s;e for Dover. Young Gauntlet went with him to &s;ee him &s;afe on board, and before they parted, a plan was &s;et|tled in what manner they &s;hould corre&s;pond with each other. When they came to Dover, par&s;on Jolter ordered an elegant &s;upper to be got ready,
<PB N="48" REF="034563_0025_0FFE2BE32BE113F8">
and &s;ome of the be&s;t Burgundy wine, but &s;carce had they &s;at down, when they were alarmed with a dreadful uproar in the next room. It happen|ed that the di&s;pute was between a furious Welch|man, and a poor Italian quack, who not finding proper encouragement in other countries, had come over to England. The Welchman who&s;e Cambrian blood was all on flame, had got the poor foreigner down, and would certainly have killed him, had not Peregrine and the re&s;t of the company come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Welchman &s;aid, the Italian was a conjurer, and young Gauntlet &s;wore that he was a Je&s;uit, becau&s;e tho&s;e Gentlemen never travel without charms and en|chantments. Peregrine however, was not &s;o very &s;uper&s;titious, but told the foreigner that he was at liberty to proceed on his journey, and that no per&s;on would mole&s;t him.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter, who had now joined the company, and heard the whole affair, declared that he dif|fered in &s;entiment from his pupil concerning witchcraft, and &s;upported his opinion by many quotations from &s;cripture, as well as from the writings of &s;ome divines in the la&s;t century. Young Gauntlet, who had been brought up in the army, corroberated all that was &s;aid by Jolt|er, and told the company that he had &s;een many apparitions, and was well convinced in his own mind of the reality of witchcraft. To all this the Welcman a&s;&s;ented by declaring that the em|pire of Belzebub was far more exten&s;ive than that of Rome, for it had extended to Glamor|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">an&s;hire,

<P>Peregrine did not chu&s;e to enter the li&s;t with three &s;uch formidable combatants, but contented him&s;elf by telling them, that he was convinced in his own mind, that witchcraft was nothing more than a &s;carecrow, or bug-bear, invented to fright|on the vulgar; after which they all went to &s;upper together in the mo&s;t amicable manner. In the cour&s;e of their conver&s;ation, it appeared that the Welchman was the &s;ame Mr. Morgan, who makes &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hing figure in the adven|tures of Roderick Random, and who had been &s;ome years &s;ettled at Canterbury. It happened, that he had been &s;ent for to wait on a &s;ick per&s;on at Dover, and the Italian being there at the &s;ame time, a mo&s;t violent di&s;pute aro&s;e concerning the nature of the medicines that &s;hould be admini&s;|tered to the patient.</P>
<P>The empiric pre&s;cribed &s;pecific medicienes, which the patient accepted of, &s;o that poor Mor|gan was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without his fee. This exa&s;|perated him &s;o much, that he &s;wore revenge a|gain&s;t the Italian and not being properly quali|fied, or rather not having a &s;ufficient &s;hare of pa|tience to rea&s;on coolly, he called the Italian a ne|cromancer becau&s;e his medicines had the de&s;ired effect. That every thing might be made agree|able to Morgan, who was really an hone&s;t fellow, Peregrine made him a pre&s;ent of as much money as he could have expected from the patient, and

for that night the company &s;eperated, in order to retire to their &s;everal appartments. In the morn|ing, when they got up, they went to vi&s;it the ca&s;tle, with every other curio&s;ity that was to be &s;een at Dover, after which they breakfa&s;ted to|gether, waiting till the packet &s;hould be ready to fall. Morgan declared that he would not leave our hero till he &s;aw him &s;afe on board, and he was as good as his word for he kept &s;tanding on the &s;hore till the packet hoi&s;ted fail, after which he and young Gauntlet marched back to the inn, and having refre&s;hed them&s;elves, &s;et out in po&s;t|chai&s;e together for Canterbury.</P>
<P>Our hero had not gone far to &s;ea, when the wind &s;hifted about, and blew directly in their faces, and the tide running high, they were in great danger of being lo&s;t. Mr. Joter, who had been bu&s;y in attempting to &s;olve one of the mo&s;t difficult problems in Euclid, happened in the mid&s;t of his reveries, to hear the boy call to put out the deadlights, whch frightened him &s;o much, that he &s;tarted up, and called out, "Lord have mercy upon us." Peregrine gave up all for lo&s;t, and ju&s;t when he was expecting that the &s;hip would go to the bottom, the individual Tom Pipes made his appearance on the deck. It &s;eems that this original genius had left the ca&s;tle the day after Peregrine departed, and getting to Dover &s;ome hours before he embarked, took his place in the packet, and concealed him&s;elf in the hold.</P>
<P>Alarmen by the danger he was in, Pipes got up from his lurking place, and gave &s;uch direc|tions
<PB N="51" REF="034563_0026_0FFE2BE4AD71B678">
to the &s;eamen, that the ma&s;ter con&s;idered him as an angel &s;ent from heaven to deliver them. By his &s;kill in naval affairs, they were enabled to weather the &s;torm, and &s;oon after the &s;pires of Calais pre&s;ented them&s;elves to their view Jolter who was a real enemy to his own country, no &s;ooner &s;aw France, that land of de&s;poti&s;m, than he began to launch out in prai&s;e of the French government. Peregrine, who had the mo&s;t con|temptible notion of his tutor's abilities, could not refrain from giving him the lie, and in proof of his opinion, no &s;ooner had they landed, than they were &s;urrounded by a parcel of cu&s;tom hou&s;e of|ficers, who began to to&s;s and tumble their bag|gage about, without any regard to the &s;o much boa&s;ted politene&s;s of their country. As Jolter had often been in France, and con&s;equently was well acquainted with the manners of the people, he gave the officers a bribe, and told them that his pulpil was a young Engli&s;h nobleman, upon which they de&s;i&s;ted from &s;earching any further. They told him however, that the baggage mu&s;t be &s;ealed up at the cu&s;tom hou&s;e, and that there were &s;ome men ready to carry the trunks thither. This &s;o enraged Peregrine, that he knocked &s;ome of them down, calling them the mo&s;t opprobri|ous names, but in an in&s;tant a whole file of mu&s;|queteers &s;urrounded the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Peregrine was not &s;uch a madman as to di&s;pute the authority of men under arms, and therefore turning to the corporal who commanded the party, de&s;ired him to accompany his baggage to

the cu&s;tom <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ee that no harm happen|ed to it. The corporal was &s;o mortified at what our hero &s;aid, that he darted him a look full of contempt, telling him at the &s;ame time, that he was &s;orry he was &s;o little acquainted with the French laws. As &s;oon as they had be&s;poke a po&s;t|chai&s;e for Paris, our hero found that there was an Engli&s;h gentleman and his lady at the &s;ame inn, and therefore he &s;ent Tom Pipes to the kitchen, in order to &s;crape an acquaintance with their foot|man. In the mean time he and Par&s;on Jolter went to view the fortifications, and upon their return, Pipes told Peregrine, that the gentleman was an old debauchee, who had in his youth de&s;|pi&s;ed matrimony, but now in his advanced years had been led into a match with an oy&s;ter wench, who&s;e impudence was equal to the &s;tation in which &s;he had been brought up. He added, that her hu&s;band, upon mature deliberation, being a&s;hamed of his conduct, had, in order to avoid the reproaches of his friends, and the &s;coffs of his companions, brought her over to France, where it was not likely that &s;he would betray her ignorance, &s;eeing that &s;he did not under&s;tand one word of the language. Her temper was violent as well as vulgar, and it was with much difficulty that her hu&s;band had prevented her from engag|ing in an intrigue with an officer, during one &s;ingle day that they &s;topped at Canterbury.</P>
<P>Peregrine's pa&s;&s;ions were now wound up to the highe&s;t pitch, and &s;eeing the lady at the window he made a mo&s;t re&s;pectful bow to her, which &s;he
<PB N="53" REF="034563_0027_0FFE2BE68DE720B8">
returned a very low curt&s;y. She was neatly dre&s;&s;ed, and had he not been informed of the nature of her former &s;tation, he would have taken her for one of tho&s;e pert ladies, who in general have that &s;ort of impudence about them which their &s;tation in life conceals under another name. He did not imagine there would be any great dif|ficulty for him to ingratiate him&s;elf into her af|fections, and with that view he &s;ent a card to her hu&s;band, who&s;e name was Hornbuck, telling him that as he was to &s;et out for Paris next day, &s;o he would be glad of his company. Mr. Horn|buck, who had &s;een all manner of &s;cenes of de|bauchery, no &s;ooner received the me&s;&s;age, than he &s;ent a very civil an&s;wer, telling our hero that he was &s;orry he could not have the plea&s;ure of his company, becau&s;e his wife had been for &s;ome days indi&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>Peregrine was no &s;tranger to his motives for &s;ending &s;uch an an&s;wer, and being extremely un|ea&s;y that he could not gratify his in forinate pa&s;|&s;ion he &s;et out next morning with Par&s;on Jolter in the po&s;t-chai&s;e, being attended by his French &s;ervants, and Tom Pipes on Hor&s;eback. They breakfa&s;ted at Bologne, and it being propo&s;ed that they &s;hould reach Abeville that night, the driver went on at &s;uch a rate, that the axle-tree broke before they had got a few miles out of the town. This accident obliged them to return to Bologne, where being under the nece&s;&s;ary of wait|ing till next day, they &s;aw &s;ome unfortunate

Scotch gentlemen who had been engaged in the rebellion, looking earne&s;tly at this happy i&s;land, from whence they were forever bani&s;hed. Pe|regrine, who had a mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate heart, could not help &s;ympathy &s;ing with them, although the differed from them in political principles.</P>
<P>He invited them to &s;pend the evening with him, but no &s;ooner had they got heated with wine, than they forgot their unhappy circum&s;tances, and launched out in invectives again&s;t the illu&s;tri|ous hou&s;e of Hanover. Our hero however, had too much genero&s;ity to triumph over their want of prudence, and although one of them, who was the principal aggre&s;&s;or, had given him a challenge, yet next morning he was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of his folly, that he came to his chamber, and a&s;ked pardon in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner, tel|ling him that his many misfortunes had almo&s;t deprived him of the u&s;e of his natural rea&s;on. His reque&s;t was granted, and having breakfa&s;ted with Peregrine, they took the mo&s;t affectionate leave of each other.</P>
<P>Next day the chai&s;e having been got ready, our adventurer, with his retinue, proceeded on their journey, and Par&s;on Jolter continued to be&s;tow the highe&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> on the French go|vernment. Peregrine interrupted him by point|ing to the barren de&s;olate &s;tate of the country, and the mi&s;erable appearance of the inhabitants in their ragged cloths and wooden &s;hoes. Jolter finding it in vain to di&s;pute with one who could refute him from the evidence of his &s;en&s;es, &s;aid

no more till they came to an inn, where they partook of a &s;mall refre&s;hment, and in the even|ing arrived at a &s;mall village called Bernay, where they called for fre&s;h hor&s;es, but were informed by the landlord, that none could be had, for the gates of Abeville were &s;hut up, and there would be no po&s;&s;ibility of their procuring <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> till next morning.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter, who had often travelled that road before, did not chu&s;e to contradict the landlord, and while &s;upper was getting ready, our hero &s;trolled about the yard, where to his great &s;ur|pri&s;e he &s;aw another chai&s;e come in with Mr. Hornbuck and his &s;pou&s;e. The landlord, though con&s;cious that he had not victuals &s;ufficient to &s;erve both his gue&s;ts, yet admitted the gentleman and his lady, and Peregrine, not doubting but he would find an opportunity of conver&s;ing with the lady, &s;ent Mr. Hornbuck an invitation to &s;up with him.</P>
<P>Mr. Hornbuck, who was really hungry, ac|cepted of the invitation, and Peregrine having led the lady into the room, placed her at the head of the table. During the evening, while they were at &s;upper, the lady could not help darting &s;ome &s;ignificant glances at our hero, which he took care to return, but that &s;erved only to in|crea&s;e the jealou&s;y of Hornbuck, who was no &s;tranger to intrigues.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time he endeavored to conceal his re&s;entment, but not being able to contain him&s;elf any longer, he reached out his foot to tread on

hers, but as ill luck would have it, he trod on the toe of par&s;on Jolter, who happened at that time to have a &s;evere corn. The application was made with &s;o much good will, that the par&s;on &s;tarted up, and roared about the room like a madman, to the no &s;mall diver&s;ion of Peregrine and the lady, who laughed in &s;uch an immoder|ate manner, that they had almo&s;t thrown them|&s;elves into convul&s;ions. Hornbuck was &s;o much confounded at the mi&s;take he had committed, that he begged pardon of Jolter, who with tears in his eyes forgave him, and then they &s;at down again to &s;upper. The re&s;t of the evening was &s;pent in the mo&s;t agreeable manner, and when the time came that they &s;hould retire to bed, Per|egrine handed the lady into her chamber. Mr. Hornbuck had gone down to the yard, and dur|ing that time, our hero declared his pa&s;&s;ion to the lady, but &s;he advi&s;ed him to retire, le&s;t her hu&s;|band &s;hould come in. He was not &s;o blind as to neglect taking a hint upon which the &s;afety of the lady depended, and therefore retiring to his chamber, &s;pent the whole night in revolving in his mind what &s;chemes would be mo&s;t proper, in order to make Hornbuck a cuckold. The lady &s;poke to him in the mo&s;t favorable manner, pre|vious to his departure, and as it had been agreed upon that they &s;hould travel together next day, he doubted not but he would find an opportun|ity of completing his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Next day they breakfa&s;ted at Abeville, where they learned that the landlord in Bernay had
<PB N="57" REF="034563_0029_0FFE2BEFC431C2D0">
played them a French trick, for the gates were not &s;hut till &s;ome hours after they arrived at the village. It was late in the evening before they reached Chantilly, which is not much to be won|dered at, when it is con&s;idered that the journey was one hundred miles. Mr. Hornbuck was &s;o much fatigued that he knew not what to do for a little re&s;t, and no &s;ooner had he &s;upped, than he fell fa&s;t a&s;leep in his chair. Jolter, who&s;e con&s;ti|tution was not &s;o delicate, had &s;wallowed &s;uch large draughts of wine, that he began to yawn, &s;o that Peregrine and the lady had &s;ome time to improve to their mutual wi&s;hes. Indeed Pere|grine had taken care to have opium admini&s;tered to Jolter in his wine, which operated &s;o &s;trongly upon him, that he dreamed the mo&s;t horrible dreams, and often &s;tarted up in violent agonies. At la&s;t being put to bed as well as Mr. Hornbuck, they both fell fa&s;t a&s;leep, for the gentleman was &s;o much overpowered, that he even forgot his &s;pou&s;e. Peregrine, who longed with impatience to enjoy the lady, went &s;oftly to her room, where he found her in a loo&s;e gown and petticoat, and was ju&s;t about completing his wi&s;hes, when Jolter got out of bed in the next room and exclaimed <HI>fire! fire!</HI></P>
<P>Women are very fertile at contriving &s;chemes. e&s;pecially where they are under the nece&s;&s;ity of of vindicating their honor from any a&s;per&s;ions that may happen to be thrown upon it, and there|fore Mrs. Hornbuck, not doubting but her hu&s;|band would awake, ran into the room where Jol|ter
<PB N="58" REF="034563_0030_0FFE2BF150CCD7A0">
was, and cried out, "Lord have mercy upon us, where is it?" Jolter, who was walking in his &s;hirt, with his eyes &s;hut, made no an&s;wer, but Peregrine vexed even to a &s;tate of madne&s;s, gave him &s;uch a &s;lap on the &s;houlder, that in an in&s;tant he was brought back to the u&s;e of his rea&s;on. Mean while, Hornbuck having awaked from his &s;leep, and mi&s;&s;ed his &s;pou&s;e, doubted not but &s;he was along with our hero, and jealou&s;y in&s;tantly took place in his mind. In going in que&s;t of his wife, he found that &s;he had dropped her under petticoat, and there being no doubt remaining of her infidelity, he walked up to her, and &s;hewed it to her. Her natural pre&s;ence of mind hinted an excu&s;e, for &s;he declared that the petticoat was not hers, &s;he not having &s;uch a one in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Peregrine, who was very fertile at invention, told him that the petticoat belonged to the inn|keeper's daughter, with whom he had an intrigue, and wondered how he could be &s;o fooli&s;h, as to prevent him from enjoying a little plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Hornbuck was too well acquainted with the tricks practi&s;ed by young gentlemen, not to &s;ee into our hero's intentions, but without di&s;cover|ing the lea&s;t mark of re&s;entment, ha&s;tened to his bed chamber with his &s;pou&s;e, and next morning &s;et out three hours before Peregrine got up.</P>
<P>Our hero was obliged to put up with his di&s;|appointment, and as &s;oon as he had taken lodg|ings at Paris, he &s;ent an account of his journey to the commodore. His next bu&s;ine&s;s was to have clothes made in the fa&s;hion, and then he
<PB N="59" REF="034563_0030_0FFE2BF150CCD7A0">
joined him&s;elf to a company of young gentlemen who &s;pent the evenings in every &s;pecies of de|bauchery. Mo&s;t of the&s;e were his own country|men, and as they had much money to &s;pend, &s;o it is not to be wondered at that they were guilty of many irregularities. In particular they went one evening to a tavern, the landlady of which was extremely hand&s;ome, and our hero &s;oon in|gratiated him&s;elf into her good graces. The lady was one of tho&s;e who are willing to be&s;tow favors, &s;o as they could be conducted with pro|priety, without giving offence to the hu&s;band; but as ill-luck would have it, her hu&s;band was ex|tremely jealous of her, and coming home one evening, found her in &s;uch an attitude with our adventurer, that he could not help te&s;tifying his re&s;entment. Peregrine, who happened to be then on the eve of enjoyment, was &s;o much vexed, that he knocked the hu&s;band down, upon which the watch was called, and all the young gentle|men taken into cu&s;tody. It happened that the officer of the night was a man of prudence, and therefore finding that little mi&s;chief had been done, he di&s;charged them with a gentle re|primand.</P>
<P>This affair made &s;uch a noi&s;e that it could not be long concealed from par&s;on Jolter, and as he re&s;pected the French government above all oth|ers in the world, he con&s;idered this part of his pupil's conduct as a high indignity offered to its laws. Indeed the tutor was &s;uch a biggoted Ja|cobite, that his acquaintance reached no further
<PB N="60" REF="034563_0031_0FFE2BF33B7E1A40">
than among &s;ome of the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h prie&s;ts, who being extremely poor, &s;pend much of their time in teaching foreigners the French language, and in&s;tilling into the minds of youth the utmo&s;t aver&s;ion to the Engli&s;h government. Such a per&s;on was not in the lea&s;t qualified to be the tutor of a young gentleman of our hero's &s;pirit, who looked upon him as a mo&s;t arrant pedant. He de&s;pi&s;ed every word that under the name of in&s;truction dropped from his mouth, &s;o that poor Jolter, in order to make the commo|dore believe that he had, at lea&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;|ure di&s;charged his duty, contented him&s;elf with writing down, from time to time, an account of the money that Peregrine &s;pent.</P>
<P>Peregrine having procured a chariot, and all other &s;orts of equipage, according to the fa&s;hion of Paris, he made his appearance at all the places of public diver&s;ion, and vi&s;ited the gardens and palaces. But one day as he was returning home, two carmen happened to meet in the &s;treets, and their carts being entangled, they both fell a box|ing according to the mode of France. Pipes who was then behind his ma&s;ter's coach, &s;eeing one of the carmen on the ground, and the other belaboring him in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> unmerciful manner, jumped from his &s;tation, and having &s;et the de|feated combatant on his legs, told him to fight boldly, and he would &s;ee fair play. According|ly the combat was again revived, and there being another coach as well as our hero's interrupted by the engagement, one of the footmen, who
<PB N="61" REF="034563_0031_0FFE2BF33B7E1A40">
&s;tood behind: &s;truck one of the combatants with his cane.</P>
<P>Pipes, who had true notions of honor, accord|ing to the &s;y&s;tem of Engli&s;h boxing, laid hold of the cane, and began to lay it about the ag|gre&s;&s;or with great dexterity. The other foot|men who were behind the coach, ran to the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of their brother. This new reinforce|ment did not in the lea&s;t intimidate Tom Pipes; for (gra&s;ping the cane) he drove two of the foot|men off, and belabored the other in &s;uch a man|ner, that he was glad to beg for mercy. The whole &s;treet was now in an uproar, for the per|&s;on who&s;e &s;ervants had been a&s;&s;aulted in this manner, was one of the princes of the blood, but being a nobleman of age and experience, and Peregrine having made &s;ome &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to him on account of his quality, his highne&s;s took him into his chariot, and treated him with every mark of re&s;pect. The prince, who perceived that our hero had more &s;pirit and education than gen|erally falls to one of his age, took him home to his own hou&s;e, and treated him as if he had been his own &s;on. He introduced him to his lady, and &s;ome other very re&s;pectable per&s;ons, but he &s;oon found that the French ladies paid no regard to any but &s;uch as &s;pend the whole of their time in gaming. Not that he had any intention to de&s;i&s;t from gaming, but he could not &s;ee with what propriety ladies, who pretended to the highe&s;t rank, could &s;o far demean them&s;elves, as
<PB N="62" REF="034563_0032_0FFE2BF4FA83B4B0">
to &s;pend their time in acting a part that &s;et them on the &s;ame footing as tho&s;e wretches whom we call common &s;harpers.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations induced him to enter him&s;elf into a celebrated academy, where he became acquainted with &s;everal &s;en&s;ible people, but volatile di&s;po&s;itions and habits, are not &s;oon eradicated. This will appear evident from the following anecdote. Peregrine who like mo&s;t other young gentlemen, was con&s;tantly in &s;earch of new &s;cenes of plea&s;ure, became acquainted with one of the polite girls of the town, and ac|cordingly took her into keeping. For &s;ome time he imagined that &s;he was one of tho&s;e, who in con&s;quence of receiving a &s;ufficient &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, would be at lea&s;t faithful to him, but he was mo&s;t wretchedly mi&s;taken, for one morning Pipes came into his room, and told him that he &s;aw a young &s;park in laced clothes go out of her chamber.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who had at &s;ometimes a large com|mand of his temper, took no notice of what was &s;aid by Tom Pipes, but going towards evening to the hou&s;e of his dulcinea, told her that he was obliged for that night to go on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of importance to a di&s;tant part of the country. The lady, who was no &s;tranger to all the arts of her profe&s;&s;ion, pretended to be very much affected but Peregrine taking leave of her with the &s;trong|e&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of love, returned to his lodgings in order to prepare him&s;elf for the executing a &s;cheme that he had formed. About twelve at
<PB N="63" REF="034563_0032_0FFE2BF4FA83B4B0">
night, having given Pipes the cue, they both &s;et out for the place, and knocked at the door, which was opened to them by a footman. Peregrine bolted in, and leaving Pipes to take care of the door, ran up &s;tairs, and knocked mo&s;t violently at the door of his dulcinea's apartment. Affairs were now in a very critical &s;ituation, but there being a window to the &s;treet, the vi&s;itor dropped out of it, and &s;o made his e&s;cape. Pipes, who happened to &s;ee him de&s;cend, made up to him, and belabored him with his cudgel, from one end of the &s;treet to the other, till being wearied with thra&s;hing him, he gave him up to the pa|trole, who took him into cu&s;tody for the night in a mo&s;t wretched condition. Next morning the French gentleman was di&s;charged, but the di&s;honor of having been beaten in &s;o vulgar a manner by an Engli&s;h footman, induced him to &s;end a challenge to Peregrine, and both met together, where our hero came off conqueror, to the great mortification of the Frenchman, who was one of the officers of the guards.</P>
<P>Par&s;on Jolter was &s;o much offended with the conduct of his pupil, that he threatened to leave him and return to England, but Peregrine hav|ing made &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions, he was diverted from his de&s;ign, and once more re&s;olved to &s;pend &s;ome time longer in his beloved France. But &s;till no|thing could re&s;train the impetuo&s;ity of our hero's pa&s;&s;ions, for intrigue &s;eemed to give life to all his actions.</P>
<P>One day as he was walking abroad to &s;ee &s;ome
<PB N="64" REF="034563_0033_0FFE2BFAEF2A4B88">
of the public places, he met Mrs. Hornbuck, and in the mo&s;t imprudent manner agreed to elope with her. Accordingly they &s;et out to|gether to a village near Paris, where they gave them&s;elves up to voluptuous plea&s;ure, till the poor hu&s;band having found out the place of their re&s;idence, procured an order to take them both into cu&s;tody. The affair began to make a con|&s;iderable noi&s;e in Paris, and it might have been attended with fatal con&s;equences, had not the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, a nobleman of great pru|dence, interpo&s;ed &s;o far as to repre&s;ent our hero as a young man who had launched out into pub|lic life before he was acquainted with the world, In con&s;equence of that repre&s;entation our hero was &s;et at liberty, but at the &s;ame time received a &s;evere reprimand, with a po&s;itive injunction never to behave in the &s;ame manner for the fu|ture.</P>
<P>Soon after he was &s;et at liberty, he went one day to vi&s;it the public places, and in one of the galleries he met with two of his coun|trymen, one of whom was a phy&s;ician, but one of the mo&s;t arrant pedants that ever lived, on the other hand the painter, who was the com|panion of the doctor, was an ignorant fellow, who had &s;uch an opinion of his own abilities, that all the ancient painters were con&s;idered by him as objects of contempt. With the&s;e two real originals in their way, our hero contracted an acquaintance, not &s;o much from motives that could attach him to them on the principles of
<PB N="65" REF="034563_0033_0FFE2BFAEF2A4B88">
virtue, as that they were objects whom he could laugh at. He attended to every thing &s;aid by them, and could &s;carce refrain from laughing, when he heard that the painter condemn|ed all the painters who&s;e works had done honor to the Italian &s;chools; and the doctor, in&s;tead of minding the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion, &s;pent the whole of his time in &s;tudying the mo&s;t &s;uper|ficial parts of the Greek language.</P>
<P>Peregrine took the fir&s;t opportunity to intro|duce his two new friends into the company of par&s;on Jolter, who received them in his u&s;ual formal manner, but as ill luck would have it, the doctor who had borrowed his notions of government from the Greek cla&s;&s;icks, &s;poke with the utmo&s;t contempt of the French gov|ernment, as being entirely de&s;potic. On the other hand Par&s;on Jolter in&s;i&s;ted that no form of government could be &s;o good as that which enabled the prince to &s;upport his prerogative, becau&s;e, in con&s;equence thereof, the people were kept in humble &s;ubjection, and none of them could find fault with the mea&s;ures of admini&s;tra|tion. At la&s;t the di&s;pute aro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that both parties would have gone to blows, had not Peregrine interpo&s;ed, and with the utmo&s;t difficulty made the contending parties good friends. In the mean time the doctor, who was in every &s;en&s;e of the word, ab&s;orbed in the &s;tudy of the cla&s;&s;ic authors, propo&s;ed to have an enter|tainment, at Paris according to the forms u&s;ed
<PB N="66" REF="034563_0034_0FFE2BFDF57DF458">
by the old Romans; and our hero, with Par&s;on Jolter were both invited as gue&s;ts. Some other foreigners were invited at the &s;ame time, among whom was a German count, and an Italian Ba|ron. Among other rarieties was a dormou&s;e pye. and a &s;ow's &s;tomach &s;tuffed with an hundred different &s;orts of herbs. The painter exclaimed that the Romans were the mo&s;t bea&s;tly fellows he had ever heard of, and the Italian taking the pye on his knees, the whole contents bur&s;led in|to his breeches, and made him roar out in the mo&s;t vociferous manner. The whole company was now one &s;cene of riot and confu&s;ion; the doctor &s;aid all he could to apologize for the con|duct of poor Pallate the painter, but all to no purpo&s;e, for every one was di&s;gu&s;ted.</P>
<P>It was in vain to call the company to order, and Peregrine, who was &s;till fond of intrigue, per&s;uaded the painter to accompany him to the opera. There having &s;pent the evening, they made a&s;&s;ignations with &s;ome girls, and were ju&s;t on the point of returning home, when their coach was interrupted by one belonging to a prince of the blood. Peregrine would not give way, and Tom Pipes having acted in the mo&s;t extravagant manner, the whole body of them were taked into cu&s;tody, and Peregrine, with the poor painter, were committed to the ba&s;tile.</P>
<P>The faithful Tom Pipes, as &s;oon as he return|ed home, went and informed the Engli&s;h amba&s;|&s;ador, and in con&s;equence of his interpo&s;ition, our hero and the painter were both &s;et at liberty. Their relea&s;e, however, was procured upon con|dition
<PB N="67" REF="034563_0034_0FFE2BFDF57DF458">
that our hero &s;hould leave Paris in a &s;hort time; and accordingly, as &s;oon as he had taken leave of his friends, he &s;et out for Flanders.</P>
<P>The painter now began to have the mo&s;t con|temptible opinion of the doctor, and during the whole of their journey the time was &s;pent in mu|tual quarrellings, the one calling the other a fool, and his companion retorting by the epithet <HI>pedant.</HI> During the fir&s;t day nothing was to be heard but di&s;putes concerning the difference between a mo|narchial and limited government, Par&s;on Jolter always taking part with the French, and the doctor at the &s;ame time condemning them.</P>
<P>About &s;even in the evening they arrived at an inn, where a &s;upper was provided for them, and as the principal part con&s;i&s;ted of rabbits, Pere|grine had a &s;trong inclination to enjoy a little fun. He per&s;uaded Tom Pipes to come into the room, and tell the gue&s;ts, that there was a &s;kin of an old ram cat hanging in the kitchen, and he was &s;ure the body was to be &s;erved up at the table. The painter, who had ju&s;t then cut up a leg of the &s;uppo&s;ed cat began to recollect that he had read the &s;tory in Gil Blas of Scipio's, and there|fore he would not eat any more. Par&s;on Jolter, who&s;e &s;tomach was not &s;o very &s;queami&s;h, told him that the people on the coa&s;t of France eat both cats and dogs, and that there could be no difference in the u&s;e of the animal, except what aro&s;e from vulgar apprehen&s;ion or common in|clination. This gave &s;o much encouragement to the poor painter, that he proceeded to eat a little
<PB N="68" REF="034563_0035_0FFE2BFFD9EBF0C8">
more till a claw, that had been properly placed in the di&s;h by Pipes, happening to fall out, he dropped his knife, and fell into a &s;woon. The doctor did all he could to relieve his friend pain|ter, to a &s;tate of &s;en&s;ibility, and at la&s;t having in &s;ome mea&s;ure affected it, they all went to bed, and next day continued their journey to Flan|ders.</P>
<P>During their journey, the doctor expatiated on the excellency of the roads of the antients, while Par&s;on Jolter repre&s;ented tho&s;e in France as far &s;uperior to any that ever had been &s;een.</P>
<P>In the evening they arrived in the neighbor|hood of Arras, but the gates being then &s;hut, they were obliged to lodge in the &s;uburbs. It is true, they might have &s;pent the evening with a great deal of plea&s;ure, but as ill luck would have it, two French officers happened to come to the inn, and engaged in gaming with our hero. They were &s;o well acquainted with the principles of gaming, that Peregrine &s;oon found he had to do with a couple of &s;harpers, and in the morning, when the landlord pre&s;ented his bill, which he did with fear and trembling, they told him that he was a mo&s;t wicked ra&s;cal, who thus thought to impo&s;e on the king's officers.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were gone, the inn-keeper came into the room, and told our hero that it was common for the military officers to do &s;o, for &s;uch was the nature of the government in France. Peregrine, who had the mo&s;t enlarged notions of government, could not help looking upon him in
<PB N="69" REF="034563_0035_0FFE2BFFD9EBF0C8">
any other light than as an enemy to the natural rights of mankind; but making the ho&s;t &s;ome amends for the injury he had received, he pro|ceeded on his journey along with his company. From Arras they proceeded to Li&s;le, where our hero &s;oon contracted an acquaintance with &s;everal Scotch officers in the Dutch &s;ervice, who had come there during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, to learn the art of war. One of the Scotch officers hap|pened to be as great a pedant in the Greek lan|guage as the doctor him&s;elf, but then he had this advantage that he had read over the commen|taries of the chevalier Follard.</P>
<P>Acquainted with fortification, as laid down by Vauban, he was convinced in his own mind that there was at lea&s;t &s;ome difference between ancient and modern fortifications. The doctor and the officer took a walk round the ramparts, and a di&s;|cour&s;e en&s;ued upon the the difference between ancient and modern fortifications. The Scotch man endeavored to &s;how, that all towns fortified according to the modern method, mu&s;t be con|&s;tructed in &s;uch a way, as to be able to re&s;i&s;t the force of balls, whereas the doctor &s;aid, that there was nothing could equal the methods u&s;ed by the Greeks. This enraged the Scotchman &s;o much that he challenged the doctor, but as the &s;on of AE&s;culapius had no intention to fight, he applied to our hero, who accommodated matters in the mo&s;t amicable manner.</P>
<P>One day as Peregrine was walking along the ramparts, he happened to fall into conver&s;ation
<PB N="70" REF="034563_0036_0FFE2C01EC5F0628">
with one of the Knights of Malta, who bore a commi&s;&s;ion in the French &s;ervice. The di&s;|cour&s;e turned upon the Engli&s;h drama, which our hero vindicated to the &s;atisfaction of the knight, who was him&s;elf a man of letters: but before they had done &s;peaking. Par&s;on Jolter arrived in a great hurry, and told them that Tom Pipes, having affronted a &s;oldier, a great mob were gathered together, and that he was in danger of being killed. Peregrine hearing the danger his faithful Pipes was in, ran up to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and took along with him the knight of Malta, who ordered the &s;oldier to be taken into cu&s;tody, and brought before him. It &s;eems that Pipes, in his walk thro the town, had got into company with &s;ome Iri&s;h &s;oldiers in the French &s;ervice, who treated him with great civility, but the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e happening to turn upon politics, Pipes cur&s;ed the pope the pretender, and the French king, as well as all tho&s;e who were connected with either.</P>
<P>This was too high an indignity for the &s;ol|diers to put up with, upon which a battle en|&s;ued between them and Pipes, in which the latter would have had the advantage, only he had no other weapon to defend him&s;elf but his fi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Peregrine was &s;o much exa&s;perated at the conduct of Pipes, the he immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from his his &s;ervice; and next day the whole company &s;et out for Ghent.</P>
<P>The whole company, be&s;ides our hero, the
<PB N="71" REF="034563_0036_0FFE2C01EC5F0628">
painter, the doctor, and Mr. Jolter, con&s;i&s;ted of a lady of plea&s;ure, a Jew broker, a capuchin Friar, and a young lady committed to the care of the latter.</P>
<P>Jolter di&s;puted with the Jew about the mean|ing of &s;ome words in the &s;criptures; the doc|tor ridiculed the capuchin; while the painter made love to the kept mi&s;tre&s;s: and Peregrine attached him&s;elf the young lady. When the company had &s;upped in the evening, they all retired to their own apartments; but Pere|grine having made an a&s;&s;ignation with the young lady, got up about midnight, and went privately to her chamber.</P>
<P>It happened that the woman of plea&s;ure lay in a bed in the &s;ame room, and the painter hav|ing got to the bed&s;ide ju&s;t at the &s;ame time that Peregrine got to the other; the capuchin, who had &s;ome &s;u&s;picions, crawled upon his all-fours, In order to make a di&s;covery. He had &s;carce got up to the middle of the room when the paint|er felt his &s;haved head, and the prie&s;t, who was an arch wag, turning his jaws round, bit the fin|ger of the painter in &s;o &s;evere a manner that he &s;creamed out fire! murder! theives! Peregrine was &s;o much enraged, that he knocked the paint|er down, and then returned to his own apartment, in order to prevent a di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Next night when they came to Aloft, Peregrine made another attempt on the young lady, but Pall<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">t the painter, who had not yet relinqui&s;hed his &s;cheme, once more got into the room at the
<PB N="72" REF="034563_0037_0FFE2C07D6F76CD0">
&s;ame time. This &s;o much exa&s;perated Peregrine, that he knocked him about till there was &s;carce any life left in him, and then decamping in the dark, the poor painter was put to bed. The doc|tor, who had been called out of bed to attend the patient, declared that he had been bit by a mad dog, and taking up the chamber pot, emptied the whole contents of it upon him. In the mid&s;t of his fury the painter got up, and would have done &s;ignal execution on the doctor, had not he taken to his heels out of the room, and overturn|ed Jolter in the pa&s;&s;age, who tumbled like a dead log of wood into the kitchen. In the morning every thing being adju&s;ted, our travellers &s;et out for Bru&s;&s;els. where Peregrine had not been long when he met accidentally with Mrs. Hornbuck, from whom he had been &s;eparated at Paris. The two lovers met together every evening at a pri|vate hou&s;e in the &s;uburbs, but Mr. Hornbuck having di&s;covered their retreat, hired two &s;oldiers to lay hold of Peregrine upon his return home, and actually make him a eunuch.</P>
<P>As good fortune would have it. Tom Pipes, who had &s;till kept near his ma&s;ter, tho not perceived by him, happened to hear the con|&s;piratiors talking of their intended &s;cheme, at a public hou&s;e, and went and gave Peregrine in|formation of the whole: our young hero had too much &s;pirit to forget the behavior of Pipes at Li&s;le, and therefore refu&s;ed at fir&s;t to &s;peak with him, but the other convinced him of the nec|e&s;&s;ity
<PB N="73" REF="034563_0037_0FFE2C07D6F76CD0">
he was under of being on his guard, upon which he was once more taken into favor.</P>
<P>A plan was now laid to defeat the &s;cheme pro|jected by Hornbuck: and in the evening. When the poor cuckold came to the place, he was drag|ged to the river, and ducked over head and ears: but his cries having brought the patroic to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, our hero was taken into cu&s;tody. Par|&s;on Jolter was quite confounded at the conduct of his pupil, but as he was &s;till under his care, he went to the governor of the city and procured his relea&s;e. They then &s;et out for Antwerp, where they had not been long when Peregrine fomented a quarrel between the painter and the doctor, and nothing le&s;s than a duel was to decide the merits of the controver&s;y.</P>
<P>Pipes was made choice of as &s;econd to the painter, and Peregrine to the doctor: but when they went on the ramparts, being both arrant cowards, they trembled like criminals who were going to be hanged In vain did the the &s;econds endeavor to force them to action, they &s;hrunk back, and the painter at la&s;t taking to his heels, Tom Pipes gave him a knock on the breech, which tumbled him down. The fall of the pain|ter gave fre&s;h &s;pirits to the doctor, who making up to him, terrified him with a number <HI>of</HI> Greek ver&s;es, which he repeated from Homer, and for|ced him to acknowledge that he had been defea|ted.</P>
<P>From Antwerp they proceeded to vi&s;it the most
<PB N="74" REF="034563_0038_0FFE2C0B015C9E18">
noted places in Holland, where they met with nothing worthy of their notice, upon, which Per|egrine, with his companions &s;et out for Harelem, and took &s;hipping for Harwich in England, be|ing de&s;irous of once more vi&s;iting his native coun|try.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he arrived in England, he went to vi&s;it &s;ome eminent per&s;ons, who&s;e relations he had met with abroad, and then &s;et out for the ca&s;tle, where he was received by the good old commo|dore in the mo&s;t gracious manner. All the poor cottagers who lived in the neighborhood, came to wi&s;h him joy on his return, and within a few weeks after he had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his be|loved &s;i&s;ter married to the young gentleman who had made his addre&s;&s;es to her before he went abroad. In the mean time his parents treated him in the &s;ame inhuman manner as before, but all this was made up by the goodne&s;s of the com|modore.</P>
<P>Having attended the commodore with the mo&s;t filial tenderne&s;s during a fit of illne&s;s, occa&s;ioned by the gout, the old gentleman propo&s;ed making over to him his whole e&s;tate, and to depend on him for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance during the remainder of his life but this was what our hero would by no means comply with. The commodore being in &s;ome mea&s;ure recovered. he gave Peregrine leave to return to London, and in his way thither he met with Emilia, and offered &s;uch rudene&s;s to her, that &s;he re&s;olved to have nothing more to do with him. This chagrined him &s;o much, that he
<PB N="75" REF="034563_0038_0FFE2C0B015C9E18">
left her mother's hou&s;e in di&s;gu&s;t; and &s;oon after his arrival in London, met with her brother God|frey, who, in con&s;equence of his good behavior, had been advanced to a lieutenancy. "After &s;ome days &s;pent in the plea&s;ures of the town, they both &s;et out for Bath, where by their cunning and in|genuity they di&s;per&s;ed a whole gang of &s;harpers. At the &s;ame time they practi&s;ed to many rogui&s;h tricks on the phy&s;icians, that tho&s;e &s;ons of the great AE&s;culapius were put to the blu&s;h amid&s;t the whole circle of their acquaintance.</P>
<P>At Bath they became acquainted with a cer|tain lady, who&s;e &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s was to entertain every promi&s;cuous company in her hou&s;e with no other view &s;ave that of procuring a name. Am|ong others who vi&s;ited her was one mr. Crabtree, an old Welch gentleman; who, in con&s;equence of &s;ome tricks that had been put upon him in his youth, became an enemy to all mankind, and was in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word a mi&s;anthrope. That he might have it in his power to retail as much &s;candal as po&s;&s;ible, he feigned him&s;elf dear, &s;o that the mo&s;t &s;ecret things were mentioned in his company, without the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion that he heard any of them.</P>
<P>With this per&s;on our hero contracted an ac|quaintance, and he &s;oon perceived that he was no more deaf than him&s;elf. Peregrine was a&s;ton|i&s;hed to hear him repeat a va&s;t number of anec|dotes relating to the nobility, and the frailty of nature among the females, &s;erved only to &s;timu|late his de&s;ires, in order if po&s;&s;ible, to be able to
<PB N="76" REF="034563_0039_0FFE2C0CDACCEA88">
add one to the number of tho&s;e, who in con&s;e|quence of their levity had been &s;educed.</P>
<P>The commodore had been for &s;ome time in a had &s;tate of health, and Peregrine thought that he could not, con&s;i&s;tent with his duty, neglect to wait on him. Accordingly he arrived at the ca&s;tle, where he was received with open arms of affection, and next day his generous benefactor departed this life. He had given the mo&s;t par|ticular directions concerning his funeral: and our hero notwith&s;tanding his volatile di&s;po&s;ition in other things, took care to have it celebrated according to his de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants, who&s;e hairs had become grey &s;ince they came to live with the commodore, la|mented the lo&s;s of an indulgent ma&s;ter, and the next day after his funeral the gentlemen in the neighborhood came to congratulate our hero on his being left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o ample a fortune.</P>
<P>Their principal de&s;ign was to try if po&s;&s;ible, to bring about a reconciliation between him and his mother, but all to no purpo&s;e, for &s;he remained as ob&s;tinate as ever, and declared that Peregrine was not her &s;on.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Peregrine having &s;ettled all his dome&s;tic affairs left the ca&s;tle in order to re|turn to London, but in his way thither be called at the hou&s;e where Emilia lived, and in a mo&s;t audacious manner made an attempt on her vir|tue. The young lady treated him with that con|tempt his conduct entitled him to, but as her
<PB N="77" REF="034563_0039_0FFE2C0CDACCEA88">
heart was not deaf to tender impre&s;&s;ions &s;he con|&s;ented to give him her company at a ma&s;querade. She imagined that he would not pur&s;ue his &s;ceme any further; but &s;he was mi&s;taken, for no &s;ooner was &s;he mixed with the croud, or rather the <HI>herd,</HI> than he made a &s;econd attempt on her virtue, but was repul&s;ed in the &s;ame manner as before, and to complete her misfortune, her uncle, who was her guardian, and had her under his protection, for bad him from coming any more to his hou&s;e, unle&s;s he had an inclination to be ducked in a hor&s;e pond.</P>
<P>Baffled in all his attempts, he was filled with the utmo&s;t chagrine, for &s;uch is the violent im|petuo&s;&s;ity of youth, that they are in general deaf to the voice of rea&s;on. They go on from one degree of extravagance to another, till it is too late to change, and they &s;eek for plea&s;ure where it can never be found. Peregrine in order to vindicate his character, wrote a long &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letter to Mrs. Gauntlet, the mother of Emilia, but the an&s;wer he received, &s;erved only to con|vince him that &s;he looked upon him with the ut|mo&s;t dete&s;tation. This &s;timulated him to &s;uch a height, that he re&s;olved never more to vi&s;it the place, upon which, after returning to &s;pend a few weeks at the ca&s;tle, he re&s;olved once more to drown his cares in London. Upon his arrival in London, he met with his old friend Cadwallader the mi&s;anthrope, who informed him concerning many curious pa&s;&s;ages relating to the intrigues
<PB N="78" REF="034563_0040_0FFE2C0EAF250BC8">
of the ladies of quality. One of them was a dutche&s;s, who had on all occa&s;ions pro&s;tituted her&s;elf to tho&s;e who were kind enough to di&s;|charge her debts contracted at a gaming table, &s;o that upon the whole &s;he was in a manner a di&s;honor to her &s;ex. Another was one of tho&s;e ladies who pay no regard to moral obligation, and therefore having lo&s;t her fir&s;t hu&s;band, whom &s;he married from motives of love, &s;he was by the orders of her father, who at that time was one of the commi&s;&s;ioners in the cu&s;tom hou&s;e, obliged to give her hand to an Iri&s;hman, who, taking him altogether, was one of the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant wretches that ever lived. They had not been long married, when the lady di&s;covered &s;uch aver&s;ion to her hu&s;band, that &s;he began to intrigue with &s;everal of the young nobility, and actually went over with one of them to France, where they &s;pent a whole &s;ummer together. At la&s;t &s;he returned to England, and finding no other way left, in order to &s;upport her in her extrava|gance, &s;he once more threw her&s;elf into the arms of her hu&s;band, and &s;pent the remainder of her time in privacy.</P>
<P>Peregrine who had &s;o much art, that &s;carce any thing could deceive him, re&s;olved to make him|&s;elf merry at the expence of his fellow creatures. Accordingly he got Cadwallader to a&s;&s;ume the character of a fortune-teller, and in con&s;equence thereof, he &s;oon got acquainted with the many secrets that would otherwi&s;e have been buried in perpetual oblivion. To a young gentleman like
<PB N="79" REF="034563_0040_0FFE2C0EAF250BC8">
our hero, this could not fail of yielding a con&s;id|erable degree of entertainment, and in con&s;e|quence thereof, he was at all times able to tri|umph over the mo&s;t dignified female characters. Nothing was more common for him than to en|ter into an intrigue with a lady of quality, and as he knew well her prior character, he thought there could be no hurt in expo&s;ing her for the fa|vor &s;he had granted him. Peregrine, who never knew where to &s;top, when he wanted to indulge his favorite pa&s;&s;ion for ridicule, re&s;olved to give &s;uch a mark of his ingenuity, as would tran&s;mit his name to all future ages.</P>
<P>Among the circle of his friends, he became acquainted with two notorious free-thinkers, or as we call them, dei&s;ts, and the&s;e men having made a mock of all &s;orts of apparitions, he con|trived to rai&s;e a fictitious one, that actually frightened them into the utmo&s;t &s;tate of &s;uper|&s;tition. The devil was repre&s;ented as ari&s;ing from hell, to take tho&s;e infidels along with him to the infernal regions, and notwith&s;tanding all the preten&s;ions that our dei&s;ts had made, yet when they &s;aw the old gentleman with the cloven foot appear, they trembled as an a&s;pin leaf, and for once declared, their dei&s;tical notions were not able to carry them thro in a day of adver&s;ity. They could not help reflecting that the heathens believed there was a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, and that brutal forti|tude to which they had &s;o long attached them|&s;elves, vani&s;hed into nothing.</P>

It was not long before our hero became cel|ebrated for being one of the greate&s;t wits of the town. He took notice of the conduct of the different nobility and gentry who happened to be in his company, and he drew their characters according to the ob&s;ervations he had made. One in particular, who had been long repre&s;ented as a patriot, or in other words a lover of his country, he repre&s;ented, according to ju&s;tice, as a mo&s;t vile infamous debauchee, who had pretended to &s;et up a &s;cheme of reformation for the whole kingdom, while he knew at the &s;ame time that he was wallowing in lu&s;t with &s;everal common pro&s;|titutes. However volatile he might be in his own di&s;po&s;ition, he could not help treating with the utmo&s;t abhorence, tho&s;e wretches who &s;et up for reformers of the nation, while at the &s;ame time their own hou&s;es exhibit nothing but &s;cenes of debauchery. In the public news papers, and many other periodical works, he endeavored to repre&s;ent tho&s;e wretches in their lively colors, and &s;urely nothing could be more commendable. Shall the debauchee &s;et up to reform the nation and promote charity, when at the &s;ame time he knows that he is going on in a cour&s;e of impu|nity? Shall the &s;pendthrift attempt to teach economy to the people, while he knows at the &s;ame time that he is living above his circum&s;tan|ces? In a word, Peregrine was convinced in his own mind, that private virtue and patrioti&s;m mu&s;t, or at lea&s;t ought to, go hand in hand to|gether, and therefore it will appear to &s;ome of

our more &s;en&s;ible readers, that tho&s;e who are not capable to take care of their own affairs, will never be able to attend tho&s;e of a public nature. Indeed it is a notion that has been too much cul|tivated in the pre&s;ent age, that people may be wicked at home, and at the &s;ame time virtuous abroad, but this is incon&s;i&s;tent with the fir&s;t prin|ciples of natural rea&s;on, for he that is faithful over little, will be faithful over much.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Hatchway had now been married &s;ome time to the widow of the commodore, but that lady had &s;o far given her&s;elf up to drinking, that &s;he was &s;eized with a drop&s;y, and there be|ing no hopes that &s;he would recover, her hu&s;|band &s;ent Peregrine a letter in the &s;tile of a &s;ea|man, de&s;iring his immediate attendance at the garri&s;on.</P>
<P>Peregrine no &s;ooner received the hone&s;t lieu|tenant's epi&s;tle, than he &s;et out for the garri&s;on, where he found his aunt in the agonies of death, and &s;taid to perform the la&s;t offices to her, after which he returned, in order to vi&s;it his compan|ions in London. In his way to London he called on his friend Gauntlet, and had the good fortune to &s;ee him happily married to the young lady whom he had courted &s;everal years. Indeed Per|egrine would have willingly married Emilia at the &s;ame time, but &s;uch was his attachment to gallantry, that he &s;till entertained hopes, or rath|er wi&s;hes, of having it in his power to &s;educe that young lady, and to triumph over her &s;hame.</P>
<P>Baffled however, in all his attempts on her vir|tue,
<PB N="82" REF="034563_0042_0FFE2C17AA496C98">
he &s;et out for London, but had not been long there, when he returned to the garri&s;on on a vi&s;it to hone&s;t Lieutenant Hatchway, who treated him with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect. Having &s;ettled &s;everal of his dome&s;tic affairs, he took leave of the Lieutenant, and in his journey picked up a young gyp&s;ey, whom he re&s;olved to take into keeping.</P>
<P>Tom Pipes was ordered to &s;ee her wa&s;hed clean and dre&s;&s;ed in a proper, manner, and altho her countenance had &s;omething ferocious in it, yet &s;he was in many re&s;pects as agreeable as &s;ome of the court ladies. He introduced her to all the noted gaming tables, where &s;he made a very di&s;|tingui&s;hing figure, for it was but a &s;hort time before &s;he made her&s;elf acquainted with all the tricks practi&s;ed in tho&s;e polite circles. But not|with&s;tanding her natural ru&s;ticity, yet &s;he had the &s;eeds of hone&s;ty in her mind; for one evening at a gaming table, having di&s;covered that one of the ladies was a dexterous hand at cheating, &s;he call|ed her a damned bitch, and walking towards the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> bid her ki&s;s her ar&s;e. The ladies pre&s;ent upbraided our hero, with having palmed upon them a common tru&s;t and he having been cloyed with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, gave her &s;ome money, and left her to make her fortune in the world in the be&s;t manner &s;he could, &s;o that &s;he &s;oon after became one of the women of the town.</P>
<P>Soon after he had di&s;carded the young gyp&s;ey, he was advi&s;ed by his old acquaintance Pallat, the painter, who had accompanied him in his journey from Paris to Flanders. The painter
<PB N="83" REF="034563_0042_0FFE2C17AA496C98">
had&punc; got &s;ome poor daubings of &s;everal capital works of the Flemi&s;h &s;chools, and had propo&s;ed to &s;ell them by &s;ub&s;cription, &s;o that he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of making him&s;elf acquainted with as many of the nobility and gentry as po&s;&s;ible. Peregrine looked upon him with the utmo&s;t con|tempt, but as he knew him to be poor, he did not &s;ay any thing to di&s;courage him.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of their conver&s;ation, the &s;ubject turned upon gaming, and our hero, who was altogether of a volatile di&s;po&s;ition, embraced an opportunity that Pallat offered him, of being in|troduced to the acquaintance of Lord Sweep|&s;takes who had for many years made the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing figure at Newmarket. As Peregrine had a con&s;iderable &s;um of money at his di&s;po&s;al, it was not long before he was fleeced of the greate&s;t part: for gamblers, let their &s;tations, be what they will, are no better than cheats.</P>
<P>Vexed to find him&s;elf bubbled in that &s;candal|ous manner, he re&s;olved to get into the mini&s;try, and for that purpo&s;e ingratiated him&s;elf into the favor of a nobleman, who propo&s;ed &s;etting him up as a candidate for one of the rotten boroughs.</P>
<P>This led him into a fre&s;h &s;eries of expences, but the other candidate having by oppo&s;ite in|tere&s;t become more &s;ucce&s;sful than Peregrine, he was obliged to &s;it down with his lo&s;s, and cur&s;e both government and mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>As Peregrine had good natural parts, he re|&s;olved to become a dependant on the mini&s;try <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in their vindication he wrote &s;everal very &s;atirical
<PB N="84" REF="034563_0043_0FFDC74035D75340">
papers. This employment, however, was of too mean a nature to &s;upport a young gentleman of our hero's &s;pirit, e&s;pecially as the dignified no|bleman gave him nothing but promi&s;es for all his trouble. It was natural for him under &s;uch circum&s;tances to de&s;cend gradually to meanne&s;s, and notwith&s;tanding the elegant manner in which our hero had been brought up, yet he became every day more and more an object of contempt among all tho&s;e with whom he had been form|erly acquainted.</P>
<P>Tortured with the&s;e melancholy reflections, he one day took a walk to the park, where he had not been long, when he was acco&s;ted by his old friend Gauntlet; who, &s;oon after his marriage, had been advanced to the command of a compa|ny. Gauntlet was accompanied by his wife and &s;i&s;ter, and no &s;ooner had our hero &s;een the latter, than all tho&s;e former emotions took place in his mind, that her per&s;on had fir&s;t in&s;pired. He &s;aid every thing he could think of in vindication of his conduct, but the young lady was extremely &s;hy, and told him that nothing but a con&s;tant per|&s;everance in the practice of every moral duty, would intitle him to her favor. They conver&s;ed together &s;ometime, and when they took their leave, he &s;wore everla&s;ting con&s;tancy to the object of his love, after which they parted for the pre&s;|ent with very different &s;entiments, for our hero was tortured with the thoughts of having incur|red the di&s;plea&s;ure of his Emilia.</P>
<P>He next a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with a club of au|thors,
<PB N="85" REF="034563_0043_0FFDC74035D75340">
mo&s;t of whom were de&s;picable wretches, but they were at the &s;ame time &s;o proud, that they would not for &s;ome time make him ac|quainted with all their &s;ecrets. As his wants were daily encrea&s;ing, he had recour&s;e once more to the mini&s;ter, who had &s;o long filled his mind with promi&s;es that he never intended to per|form&punc; but altho &s;everal lucrative places where then vacant, yet he was given to under&s;tand that they had all been di&s;po&s;ed of. This declaration of the mini&s;ter mortified him &s;o much, that he could not conceal his re&s;entment any longer, and therefore turning about, he left the pre&s;ence chamber in the utmo&s;t di&s;gu&s;t. From the min|i&s;ter's hou&s;e, he went to vi&s;it the authors, whom he &s;ound engaged in a mo&s;t violent di&s;pute con|cerning the merits of &s;ome of their performances.</P>
<P>Peregrine had but little to &s;ay, for as yet he was no more than a novice, but as ill luck would have it, in the mid&s;t of the di&s;pute, a bailiff came with a writ again&s;t one of them. The defend|ant, who was no &s;tranger to the power of catch-poles, no &s;ooner heard of his danger, than he jumped out of the window, and pitching upon the top of a &s;edan, ovterturned it, with a young ma|caroni who had been dre&s;&s;ed out in the highe&s;t ta&s;te, in order to make his appearance at the opera. In the mean time he became acquaint|ed with &s;ome of tho&s;e in&s;ignificant wretches called antiquarians, who &s;pend mo&s;t of their time in looking over old coins and manu&s;cripts, that
<PB N="86" REF="034563_0044_0FFE2C1B17F57BE0">
cannot be read but by the help of magnifying gla&s;s, and an index to explain the contractions. He had the good fortune however, in con&s;e|quence of his political writings, to procure a &s;mall pen&s;ion from the mini&s;ter, which for &s;ome time was regularly paid, but as he &s;till wi&s;hed for a &s;ettlement, he one day put the mini&s;ter in mind of his promi&s;e, and as he did not receive a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, he went home and wrote him a letter, wherein he taxed him with duplicity, and the con&s;equence was, that he was in&s;tantly di&s;charged. The affair of being di&s;carded made &s;ome noi&s;e among tho&s;e at the head of affairs; but the mini&s;ter, who was hackneyed in all the ways of iniquity, told them that our hero was di&s;ordered in his mind, and for &s;ome time the &s;tory was believed. In revenge for being treated in &s;o di&s;graceful a manner, be commenced a writer again&s;t the mini&s;try and treated the whole of their conduct with &s;uch ridicule, that they be|came objects of dete&s;tation to all ranks of peo|ple in the nation.</P>
<P>But this did not an&s;wer his expectation, for the mini&s;ter who had never entered into any agreement with him, cau&s;ed him to be arre&s;ted, and from a &s;punging-kou&s;e he was removed to the Fleet pri&s;on. There he found his confine|ment much better than is common in other pri&s;ons and he met with &s;everal per&s;ons who did all they could to make his confinement as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible. Among others, he met with a per&s;on who had &s;pent his whole fortune,
<PB N="87" REF="034563_0044_0FFE2C1B17F57BE0">
in order to procure ju&s;tice to an injuried young gentleman, but by a quibble in law, which will ever remain a di&s;grace to ju&s;tice, he had been non&s;uited, and in con&s;equence thereof, not being able to pay his co&s;ts, he was arre&s;ted and com|mitted to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>The news of Peregrine being committed to pri&s;on &s;oon reached the ears of lieutenant Hatch|way, who with all his foibles was really a good man. The hone&s;t lieutenant, in company with Tom Pipes, &s;et out for London and not knowing Peregrine was to be confined for life, propo&s;ed taking lodgings along with him in the fleet.</P>
<P>Peregrine &s;aid all he could to di&s;&s;uade them from &s;uch a re&s;olution, but all that he could pre|vail upon them to do was to take lodgings in the &s;ame neighborhood. As it was their con&s;tant practice to vi&s;it our hero two or three times in the day, and to &s;pend the evenings with him, &s;o one night while Crabtree, the mi&s;anthrope was there, they happened to quarrel, and the poor Welchman was to&s;&s;ed in a blanket. This was con&s;idered as &s;uch an outrage, that the warden ordered that Hatchway and Pipes &s;hould never be again admitted into the pri&s;on, and in the mean time Peregrine gave him&s;elf up to all manner of &s;loth and na&s;tine&s;s.</P>
<P>While he continued in this deplorable &s;ituation, his old friend Gauntlet, who had come to town in order to procure advancement in the army, came to the fleet to vi&s;it him, and condoled with
<PB N="88" REF="034563_0045_0FFE2C1F925A9FA8">
him on the unhappy &s;tate of his then circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>As good luck would have it, a per&s;on to whom Peregrine had lent &s;ome money, to equip him for an Ea&s;t India voyage, happened at that time to arrive in the Downs, and as he had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s, he came to the pri&s;on and paid the debt for which our hero had been ar|re&s;ted.</P>
<P>Being thus at liberty, he went to vi&s;it his old friend the lieutenant, who, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome di&s;putes that they had before, received him with open arms of friend&s;hip. He was informed by Hatchway, that his father had been dead &s;ome time, and that he had left his whole fortune to his &s;on Gam. That was a mo&s;t mortifying &s;troke to our hero, who notwith&s;tanding all the unnat|ural u&s;age of his parents, yet imagined that his father would have done him ju&s;tice at la&s;t. This induced him to hold a con&s;ultation with his friends, who were all of opinion that there was &s;omething unfair, and that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to make a proper enquiry into the nature of the will. This led to a di&s;covery that the whole was a collu&s;ion carried on by the intrigues of his mo|ther, who had got a fal&s;e will &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of the true one, to the injury of her elde&s;t &s;on. This led to a further enquiry, and upon the mo&s;t mature deliberation the whole cheat was di&s;covered. The noi&s;e occa&s;ioned by this affair reached all over the country, but our hero, con|&s;i&s;tent with his common notions of benevolence,
<PB N="89" REF="034563_0045_0FFE2C1F925A9FA8">
made a &s;ettlement on his mother and brother, after which he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate, and proved him&s;elf to be the real heir at law to his father, notwith&s;tanding all that had been done to injure him.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled every thing of importance, he went to &s;ee his friend Gauntlet, and it was agreed upon between them to &s;pend &s;ome time in the country. This was in a manner ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary for our hero, who had been confined &s;e|veral months, in a pri&s;on, as the principle rea&s;on was to bring about a match between the two lovers.</P>
<P>Gauntlet had a real friend&s;hip for Peregrine and told him that he would do every thing in his power to bring about an eclairci&s;&s;ement between him and his &s;i&s;ter. Accordingly our hero was in|dulged with an interview with his beloved Emi|lia, but &s;he was &s;o much on the re&s;erve that it did not give him any &s;atisfaction. Mortified at his di&s;appoinment he retired into another room, but had not been there long when he heard a di|alogue between the brother and &s;i&s;ter, that gave him the mo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure. Emilia &s;aid &s;he had no objections to Peregrine, except &s;uch as aro&s;e from the nature of his conduct, which on many occa&s;ions had been very irregular. To this her brother an&s;wered, that whatever might have been his foibles, yet they were merely owing to the unguarded &s;allies, of youthful imprudence, but as he had now returned to a regular di&s;charge
<PB N="90" REF="034563_0046_0FFE2C23EDB0D6A0">
of his duty as a man of honor and virtue, &s;he could not with the lea&s;t colour of rea&s;on have any objection to him.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who overheard this di&s;cour&s;e, was in a manner quite tran&s;ported, and waited for an opportunity, of embracing his charmer, and run|ning into her room flung him&s;elf at her feet in humble pro&s;tration.</P>
<P>As &s;he could not bear to &s;ee him in that atti|tude, &s;he gave him encouragement to ri&s;e, and then cla&s;ping her in his arms, he told her that he was forever devoted to her, and that he would live and die with her. She told him, that he had been &s;o wicked, that he ought to have undergone a &s;evere puni&s;hment, but as things then were, &s;he was willing at once to pardon him, and put up with a man for her hu&s;band whom &s;he believed would be an arrant tyrant. In an&s;wer to this as he was &s;carce able to &s;peak, he told her that he had eighty thou&s;and pounds in money, which &s;hould be at her &s;ervice, and as a proof of his &s;incerity, he offered to lay the whole in her lap. So &s;hying, he cla&s;ped her again in his arms, and &s;ealed the contract into which he had entered, with be&s;towing a thou&s;and ki&s;&s;es upon her who was more dear to him than his life.</P>
<P>Every thing being &s;ettled for the nuptials, our hero &s;et out for the commons, in order to procure a licence, by which his happine&s;s was to be &s;ealed. It is true Emilia made &s;ome ob|jection to his being &s;o precipitate in an affair of &s;uch importaace,, but her brother, the captain,
<PB N="91" REF="034563_0046_0FFE2C23EDB0D6A0">
having interpo&s;ed, &s;he was brought to hearken to the voice of rea&s;on, and gave her con&s;ent to the performance of the ceremony. Lieutenant Hatchway, who had never lo&s;t &s;ight of our hero, re&s;olved to be pre&s;ent at the ceremony of the marriage, and as he always liked a little fun, he propo&s;ed to make Peregrine drunk, previous to his going to bed. In that, however, he was di&s;|appointed, for our hero was on his guard, and took care not to drink any more liquor than was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The ceremony being over, Tom Pipes danced like a madman, as if he had been on the foreca&s;tle of a man of war, while Hatchway regaled him|&s;elf over a bowl of rum and water, in the &s;ame manner as if he had been on the quarter deck of the commodore's &s;hip. At la&s;t the new married couple retired, and next day was &s;pent in the ut|mo&s;t degree of fe&s;tivity. From London they &s;et out for the country, where our hero ordered the ca&s;tle to be put in proper repair, and having &s;et|tled every thing with his tenants he went to vi&s;it his &s;i&s;ter, whom he found the mother of two beau|tiful young children.</P>
<P>He was, as well as his &s;pou&s;e, received by her with every mark of re&s;pect, and rejoiced in hav|ing it in his power to contribute towards pro|moting her happine&s;s. He lived agreeably and happily with his dear Emilia, and &s;he &s;oon made him a happy father.</P>
<P>Their friends and acquaintance looked upon them&s;elves as happy in being connected with two
<PB N="92" REF="034563_0047_0FFE2C25B112E1A8">
per&s;ons of &s;o much worth, and their fame for the exerci&s;e of every benevolent action, reached to the exterior parts of the country, where their names were known.</P>
<P>Peregrine detached him&s;elf from every vicious practice, and day after day convinced his wife that he was far from being an object unworthy of her choice, or improper for her to place her affections upon.</P>
<P>To conclude this work it is nece&s;&s;ary to take notice of what happened to the other celebrated per&s;onages who have been &s;o often mentioned in it. We have already con&s;igned the commo|dore to the &s;ilent grave, and have &s;een that his widow, after having been married &s;ome years to Lieutenant Hatchway, paid the debt of nature, and was depo&s;ited be&s;ide her fir&s;t hu&s;band, or to u&s;e the &s;ea phra&s;e, &s;he was &s;afely moored.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Hatchway &s;urvived the marriage of our hero about two years, mo&s;t part of which was &s;pent in drinking his can of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and &s;moak|ing his pipe. He often wi&s;hed for war that he might have one opportunity more of giving or|ders on the quarter-deck; but as nothing of that nature happened, he was obliged to come to an anchor, and be laid up in an everla&s;ting dock.</P>
<P>Tom Pipes &s;urvived him about three years, and was treated by Peregrine with every mark of re&s;pect, and what added mo&s;t to his plea&s;ure was, that the lovely Emilia &s;uffered him to have a hammock to &s;wing in, as if he had been &s;till
<PB N="93" REF="034563_0047_0FFE2C25B112E1A8">
on board, or in the garri&s;on. At la&s;t a violent &s;torm obliged him to &s;lip his anchor, and as there was none ready to take him in row, he went to bottom and was never after heard of.</P>
<P>The doctor who&s;e fea&s;t had made &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hing figure at Paris and antwerp, returned to London, where he publi&s;hed pro|po&s;als for a tran&s;lation of Pindar from the original Greek; but not meeting with the &s;uc|ce&s;s he expected, he commenced writer for a book&s;eller, and did every thing in his power to ridicule the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem. At la&s;t he became &s;o notorious for his licentious writings, that an indictment was preferred again&s;t him, and being found guilty on the cleare&s;t evidence, he was committed to Newgate, till &s;uch time as he &s;hould pay a fine according to the judgment of the court. There he continued near two years in the utmo&s;t &s;tate of penury, till at la&s;t being forced by nece&s;&s;ity, he wrote in defence of admi|ni&s;tration, and in con&s;equence thereof procured his relea&s;e, and at the &s;ame time received a pen|&s;ion of three hundred pounds a year, by the in|terce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e in power.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter of &s;tate, by who&s;e cruelty our hero had been &s;o long vilely oppre&s;&s;ed, was, in con&s;equence of a change at court, turned out of all employments, and &s;pent the remainder of his time in fomenting &s;chemes to cro&s;s the mea&s;ures of government. At la&s;t he died, not only un|pitied, but even hated by all tho&s;e who had for|merly known him, nor was there one left to &s;hed
<PB N="94" REF="034563_0048_0FFE2C27DAB3B180">
a tear over his grave. He had domineered over his fellow &s;ubjects while he was intru&s;ted with power, but no &s;ooner were his remains laid in the grave, than &s;ome of the meane&s;t of them trod on them.</P>
<P>Pallat, the painter, who was one of the mo&s;t arrant blockheads that ever lived, publi&s;hed pro|po&s;als for &s;ome of his daubings, but they were executed in &s;o wretched a manner, that he became an object of dete&s;tation to all the&s;e who knew him. His family was reduced to want, and his creditors becoming clamorous, he was arre&s;ted, and glad to take up the &s;ame lodgings in the Fleet, from which our hero had been &s;o fortu|nately delivered. There he remained till he was &s;et at liberty by an act of in&s;olvency, and the re&s;t of his days were &s;pent in penury, which would have been &s;till greater, had not our hero contributed towards his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to our hero, he &s;oon obtained a &s;eat in parliament, and made a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|ing figure as a a Briti&s;h &s;enator. His family in|crea&s;ed in the cour&s;e of time, and &s;uch was his benevolence, that he never lo&s;t &s;ight of &s;uch op|portunities as put it in his power to be &s;ervice|able to his fellow creatures. From the whole of the&s;e circum&s;tances we may learn, that it is nev|er too late to refrain from vicious cour&s;es, and that whenever information takes place, beneficial con&s;equences will follow. Such is the nature of things in this world, that we never know when
<PB N="95" REF="034563_0048_0FFE2C27DAB3B180">
to form a judgment till we are directed by the con&s;equences, and this &s;hould teach us to watch over every part of our conduct&punc; and to make it appear to the world that we are not unworthy members of &s;ociety.</P>

<HEAD>SELECT SENTENCES, Worthy ob&s;ervation of the pre&s;ent age.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN may have a thou&s;and intimate ac|quaintances, and not a friend among them all. If you have one friend think your&s;elf happy. When once you profe&s;s your&s;elf a friend, endeavor to be always &s;uch. He can never have any true friends, that will be often changing them.</P>
<P>Complai&s;ance, or as Lord Che&s;terfield calls it, the <HI>&s;uaviter in modo,</HI> renders a &s;uperior amiable, an equal agreeable, and an inferior acceptable.</P>
<P>Exce&s;s of ceremony &s;hows want of breeding. That civility is be&s;t which excludes all &s;uperflu|ous formality.</P>
<P>No man hath a thorough ta&s;te of pro&s;perity, to whom adver&s;ity never happened.</P>
<P>None more impatiently &s;uffer injuries than tho&s;e who are mo&s;t forward in doing them.</P>
<P>A more glorious victory cannot be gained over another man, than this, that where the in|jury began on his part, the kindne&s;s &s;hould begin on ours.</P>
<P>We &s;hould take a prudent care for the future, but &s;o as to enjoy the pre&s;ent. It is no part of wi&s;dom to be mi&s;erable to day, becau&s;e we may happen to be &s;o to-morrow.</P>

The man who is de&s;titute of good &s;en&s;e, is un|happy in having learning; for he has thereby more ways of expo&s;ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The character of the per&s;on who commends you, is to be con&s;idered before you &s;et a value on his e&s;teem. The wi&s;e man applauds him whom he thinks mo&s;t virtuous; the re&s;t of the world him who is mo&s;t wealthy.</P>
<P>A good man will love him&s;elf too well to lo&s;e, and his neighbors too well to win, an e&s;tate by gaming. The love of gaming will corrupt the be&s;t principles in the world.</P>
<P>It is the infirmity of little minds to be taken with every appearance, and dazzled with every thing that &s;parkles; but great minds have but little admiration, becau&s;e few things appear new to them.</P>
<P>He that is truly polite, knows how to contra|dict with re&s;pect, and to plea&s;e without adula|tion; and is equally remote from an in&s;ipid complai&s;ance, and a low familiarity.</P>
<P>Nobility is to be con&s;idered only as an imag|inary di&s;tinction, unle&s;s accompanied with the practice of tho&s;e generous virtues by which it ought to be attained. Titles of honor conferred opon &s;uch as have no per&s;onal merit, are at be&s;t but the royal &s;tamp &s;et upon ba&s;e metal.</P>
<P>Truth is always con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and needs nothing to help it out. It is always near at hand, and &s;its upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware; where as a lie is trouble&s;ome, and &s;ets a man's invention upon
<PB N="99" REF="034563_0050_0FFE2C30CD9981A0">
the rack; and one trick needs a great many more to make it good.</P>
<P>He that lies in bed all a &s;ummer's morning, lo&s;es the chief plea&s;ure of the day; he that gives up his youth to indolence, undergoes a lo&s;s of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>Fine &s;en&s;e and exalted &s;en&s;e are not half &s;o, valuable as common &s;en&s;e. There are forty men of wit for one man of &s;en&s;e; and he that will carry nothing about him but gold, will be every day at a lo&s;s for want of ready change.</P>
<P>A man &s;hould never be a&s;hamed to own he has been in the wrong; which is but &s;aying in other words, that he is wi&s;er to day than he was ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>Wherever I find a great deal of gratitude in a poor man, I take it for granted there would be as much genero&s;ity if he were a rich man.</P>
<P>Flowers of rhetoric in &s;ermons of &s;erious di&s;|cour&s;es, are like the blue and red flowers in corn plea&s;ing to tho&s;e who come only for amu&s;ement, but prejudicial to him who would reap the profit.</P>
<P>It often happens that they are the be&s;t peo|ple, who&s;e characters have been mo&s;t injured by &s;landerers; as we u&s;ually find that to be the &s;weete&s;t fruit which the birds have been picking.</P>
<P>The eye of a critic is often like a micro&s;cope, made &s;o very fine and nice, that it di&s;covers the atoms, grains, and minute&s;t particles, without ev|er comprehending the whole, comparing the parts, or &s;eeing all at once the harmony.</P>

Honor is but a fictitious kind of hone&s;ty; a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, but a nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;titute for it in &s;ocieties who have none; it is a &s;ort of paper credit, with which men are obliged to trade, who are defi|cient in the &s;terling ca&s;h of true morality and religion.</P>
<P>The chief advantage that ancient writers can bea&s;t over the modern, &s;eems owing to &s;implici|ty.

<HEAD>THE GHOST.</HEAD>
<P>A London gentleman went to &s;ee his relations in the country. The hou&s;e was full, a wedding being celebrated there. Only one room was vacant. There no one cho&s;e to &s;leep, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be haunted. The London &s;park had no fear about him, and &s;aid he would &s;leep

there. He fell a&s;leep. About three in the morning he was wakened by the opening of the door, and the enterance of young women in appearance, with only a night dre&s;s an head, ann &s;hoift on. This lovely appearence walked two or three times about the room, and at length laid it&s;elf down on the bed. The young gentleman did not much like his unknown bedfellow. He lay as far as he could on the other &s;ide. After &s;ometime he perceived his bedfellow breathe, and &s;uppo&s;ing her to be true fle&s;h and blood, and no phantom, he ventured to touch her. He was confirmed in his opinion, and finding a ring on her finger, he gently took it off. She lay &s;ome time, and he did not di&s;turb her. She then got up, and went out of the room as &s;he came in. The young gentleman perceived how the room was haunted, by a female walking in her &s;leep. The morning came. The family were inqui&s;i|tive about him. He de&s;ired the family might be &s;ummoned, when lo! the ring fitted the elde&s;t daughter's finger, who had been in great tribulation about the lo&s;s. "This, Sir," &s;aid he to the father, "is the lovely &s;pirit which haunts the room." She declared her&s;elf perfectly ig|norant; but was convinced of its truth becau&s;e of the ring. "Well, Sir," &s;aid the father, "if you have no objection, &s;ince my daughter has been to bed to you, you &s;hall go to bed to my daughter; and there is 5000l. for her portion." The match was that day con&s;ummated.</P>
