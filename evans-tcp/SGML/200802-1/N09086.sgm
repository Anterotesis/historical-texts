<P>At the reque&s;t of a great number of Gen|tlemen, friends to the LIBERTIES of North-America, who were de&s;irous, not|with&s;tanding the removal of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts General-Court (uncon&s;titutionally as they judged) to CAMBRIDGE, that GOD might be acknowledged in that hou&s;e of wor&s;hip at BOSTON, in which our tribes, from the days of our fathers, have annu|ally &s;ought to him for direction, previ|ous to the choice of his Maje&s;ty's Council.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM 22.4.</HI></BIBL>
<P>"Our fathers tru&s;ted in thee: they tru&s;ted, and thou did&s;t deliver them".</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_HOLY <HI>David</HI> &s;pake the&s;e words in the name of the Jewi&s;h nation, looking back to their pious ance&s;tors, through the &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive periods, in which they had exi&s;ted as a people; and what he &s;ays con|cerning them is, that they "tru&s;ted in GOD". He then records the happy effect con&s;equent thereupon "Thou did&s;t deli|ver them": which deliverance GOD &s;ome|times wrought out for them in the mo&s;t &s;ignal manner; "riding in the heavens for their help, and in his excellency on the clouds".</P>
<P>THE in&s;pired p&s;almi&s;t reminds the Jewi&s;h people, in his day, of this piety of their pro|genitors, and the good effect of it, that he might excite in them a becoming concern to make GOD the &s;upreme object of their tru&s;t; en|couraging them, in this way, to hope for de|liverance, however pre&s;&s;ing the difficulties might be they were under.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="011599_0005_0F87795E5457EA90">MY text, though thus primarily directed to the Jews to engage their tru&s;t in GOD, that they might obtain deliverance from evil, is yet applicable to other people, under like circum&s;tances; and may obviou&s;ly be ac|commodated to the people of GOD in this land. Perhaps, there are no people, now dwelling on the face of the earth, who may, with greater pertineney, adopt the language of king <HI>David,</HI> and &s;ay, "our fathers tru&s;t|ed in thee; they tru&s;ted, and thou did&s;t de|liver them".</P>
<P>I &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e to the words in this ac|commodated &s;en&s;e; taking occa&s;ion from them to &s;peak of our pious ance&s;tors as tho&s;e who "tru&s;ted in GOD"; and then of the good effect of their &s;o doing, in the "deliverances GOD wrought out for them". The way will then be clear to point out to us their po&s;te|rity our duty in this day of trouble, and the good effect we may humbly look for from the faithful performance of it.</P>
<P>IT may with real truth be &s;aid of our pious progenitors, that they "tru&s;ted in GOD"; that is, that they made GOD the alone ultimate object of their dependence in every time of need. And this they did, not blindly, or groundle&s;sly, as having no &s;olid rea&s;on for their conduct; but from ju&s;t conceptions of that wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s of GOD, which render him a being
<PB N="7" REF="011599_0006_0F87795FF1144138">
every way &s;utable to be intirely confided in. In this view of the all-&s;ufficiency of GOD, they ever repaired to him as their &s;trength and refuge, commiting them&s;elves, and all their concerns, into his hands, and relying on him as their &s;upreme help. Sen&s;ible of their own inability to provide for and pro|tect them&s;elves, and of the inability of all creatures without GOD, much more in op|po&s;ition to him, they took off their depen|dence from every thing el&s;e, and placed it on him &s;upremely and ultimately, as that glorious, and yet gracious, being, who alone was &s;ufficient to be their guide, de|fence, and help, e&s;pecially in their days of trouble.</P>
<P>THUS our fathers tru&s;ted in GOD; and &s;ome &s;pecial properties of this their tru&s;t, are eminently worthy of notice.</P>
<P>IT was a tru&s;t accompanied with prayer. This is ob&s;erved, in the ver&s;e immediately following my text, concerning the tru&s;t of the Jewi&s;h fathers. "They cried unto thee, and were delivered". They prayed, as well as tru&s;ted. They not only made GOD their dependance, but commited their ca&s;e to him in humble, fervent &s;upplicati|ons. In like manner, prayer to that glori|ous being who dwelleth on high, was ever
<PB N="8" REF="011599_0007_0F8779611D59A430">
a concomitant of that tru&s;t which the pious forefathers of the people of <HI>New England</HI> placed in GOD. They were eminently men of prayer; they prayed always; and their prayers were more abundant, and more im|portunate and ince&s;&s;ant, when their circum|&s;tances made it proper to make GOD their &s;pecial refuge in any times of more than or|dinary difficulty and danger. They now be&s;ieged the throne of GOD, with their fer|vent cries, at once hoping in his mercy, and praying to him for the be&s;towment of it.</P>
<P>THEIR tru&s;t al&s;o was accompanied with humility, a becoming &s;en&s;e of their unwor|thine&s;s, and the infinite conde&s;cention of GOD, that he &s;hould be willing to allow &s;uch &s;inful unde&s;erving creatures to place their dependence on him for protection and help. They entertained in their minds exalted ap|prehen&s;ions of this favor of the "high and lofty one who inhabiteth eternity"; and as low ones of them&s;elves, in con&s;ideration of their own comparative nothingne&s;s, much more of their &s;infulne&s;s, whereby they had expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the righteous re&s;ent|ments of heaven.</P>
<P>THEIR tru&s;t in GOD was likewi&s;e exerci|&s;ed with profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his alwi&s;e plea&s;ure, as to the time, manner, mea&s;ure,
<PB N="9" REF="011599_0008_0F877961DE4655F0">
and all the circum&s;tances relative to the good they confided in him for. They were &s;o re&s;igned as to have no will of their own, in oppo&s;ition to GOD's. That was the feel|ing of their hearts, as well as the language of their lips, in all times of danger and di&s;|tre&s;s, whether per&s;onal or public, "let the Lord do to us as &s;eemeth good to him". "Father, not as we will, but as thou wilt".</P>
<P>Again, THEIR tru&s;t in GOD was &s;teadily and firmly fixed. Nothing was able to &s;hake their confidence in the divine per|fections, and promi&s;es, no difficulties in the cour&s;e of providence, no di&s;couragements, no dangers, no tryals however heavy and &s;evere; but in the mid&s;t of all, and not|with&s;tanding all, they had re&s;t in their &s;ouls by re&s;olutely cleaving to GOD as their ultimate hope and refuge. With holy Job they could &s;ay, "tho' he &s;lay me, yet will I tru&s;t in him"; Yea, they could triumph in the lan|guage of the 46th P&s;alm, "GOD is our refuge and &s;trength, a very pre&s;ent help in trouble. Therefore will we not fear, tho' the earth be removed, and the mountains be carried into the depth of the &s;eas; tho' the waters thereof roar and are troubled; tho' the mountains &s;hake with the &s;welling thereof".</P>
<P>Yet again, THEIR tru&s;t in GOD was ac|compained
<PB N="10" REF="011599_0009_0F877962A0AF5EE0">
with their own endeavours, in the u&s;e of proper means, in order to the ob|tainment of needed &s;alvation and deliver|ance: Otherwi&s;e, in&s;tead of placing a well grounded confidence in the divine all-&s;uffici|ency, they would have been chargeable with the weakne&s;s and folly of pre&s;uming up|on the help of heaven. For it ought always to be remembered, tho' it is GOD ultimately who protects, helps, and &s;aves; yet, he or|dinarily does this by the intervention of &s;econd cau&s;es, adapted in their nature to the purpo&s;e. Our fathers, therefore, that they might not &s;ub&s;titute pre&s;umption, in the room of a well-placed tru&s;t, joined with their dependance on GOD, tho' in ab&s;olute &s;ub|ordination to it, a due u&s;e of &s;uch means as he has been wont to accompany, or fol|low, with his ble&s;&s;ing. Had they, in a time of danger, needle&s;sly expo&s;ed them&s;elves, or had they not taken &s;uch methods as were wi&s;e, fit and rea&s;onable, in order to their own pre&s;ervation and &s;afety, they would in vain have tru&s;ted in GOD; as in this way only they might rea&s;onably have expected his ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, their tru&s;t in GOD was an obediential one. They at once obeyed GOD and depended on him. They made it their care to walk in the way of his command|ments;
<PB N="11" REF="011599_0010_0F87796358A109D8">
and now they confided in his power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s to defend, protect, guide, and do them good. For, as the &s;cripture &s;ays, to which they always paid a &s;acred regard, "the Lord is a &s;un and &s;hield; the Lord will withhold no good thing";&mdash; from whom? It follows, "from them that walk uprightly".</P>
<P>IN fine, their tru&s;t in GOD was exerci&s;ed thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This &s;on of GOD's love they e&s;teemed the divinely appointed medi|um of communication between GOD and man, and the only one that was &s;o. Thro' him they believed GOD was reconcilable to &s;inners, and might be a friend to &s;upply their wants, to help them under difficulties, to guard them again&s;t dangers, and to be their &s;alva|tion in a day of trouble. They accordingly repaired to GOD thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the one mediator between GOD and men, making him their refuge, the &s;upreme object of their dependance in regard both of &s;oul and body, this world and another. The worthine&s;s of CHRIST, and not their own, was the rea&s;on or ground of all they expected in con&s;e|quence of their tru&s;ting in him They knew GOD was ever well plea&s;ed with his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in vertue of his obedience to the death; and that, thro' him, they might with humble confidence rely on him to pity,
<PB N="12" REF="011599_0011_0F87796570D40BB8">
and help them; to appear their &s;avior, and work out deliverance for them. Him there|fore they made the great object of their tru&s;t, their &s;upreme refuge, and all-&s;ufficient di|rector and protector.</P>
<P>AND they found their account in thus tru&s;ting in GOD. For what is &s;aid in the latter part of my text, is ju&s;tly applicable to them, "Thou did&s;t deliver them".</P>
<P>THE word, "deliverance", carries in it the idea of difficulty and danger, either felt or feared. Our fathers were often expo&s;ed to dangers, and &s;ometimes called, in the cour&s;e of providence, to &s;uffer the tryal of pre&s;&s;ing difficulties. GOD was their refuge in the&s;e times of trouble, in him they tru&s;t|ed; and the effect was, their deliverance out of all their troubles.</P>
<P>IT was a day of grievous tryal to them, when they were oppre&s;&s;ed in England, by having put on their necks the eccle&s;ia&s;tical yoke of bondage, which was &s;orely galling. They were not permitted to wor&s;hip their GOD according to the dictates of con&s;cience, guided by his word. And unle&s;s they &s;ub|mitted to the inventions of man, added to the ordinances of GOD, they became liable to fines, confi&s;cations, impri&s;onments, and
<PB N="13" REF="011599_0012_0F8779670F11A2B0">
bani&s;hment. It could &s;carce be believed what they were called to, unle&s;s they would &s;hipwreck faith and a good con&s;cience, was a rehear&s;al to be here given of what they &s;uffered.&mdash;But, as they tru&s;ted in GOD, he made way for their deliverance from this tyranny, by bringing them over to this then de&s;olate land, with CHARTER-RIGHTS, not only &s;etting them free from the oppre&s;&s;ion of church power, but intitling them to di&s;tin|gui&s;hing liberties and privileges, both civil and religious. And very &s;ignal was the ap|pearance of heaven on their behalf in bring|ing about this deliverance. The alwi&s;e good GOD not only gave them favor with the great men at home, &s;o as to encourage their enter|prize to this new and unknown part of the world; but made a path for them in the great waters, and bro't them over the at|lantic to the&s;e then dangerous, becau&s;e, in that day, untried &s;hoars; landing them in &s;afety. The deliverance of our forefa|thers from tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, by bring|ing them over to this di&s;tant region, is not unlike his carrying his I&s;rael of old thro' the red &s;ea to the promi&s;ed land of re&s;t: And that might have been their &s;ong of prai&s;e upon this account, "The Lord is our &s;trength and &s;ong; and he is become our &s;alvation. He is our GOD, and we will pre|pare him an habitation. Who is like unto
<PB N="14" REF="011599_0013_0F8779671A91FC98">
thee, O Lord, among the Gods? Who is like thee, glorious in holine&s;s, fearful in prai&s;es, doing wonders. Thou in mercy ha&s;t led forth the people whom thou ha&s;t redeemed; thou ha&s;t girded them in thy &s;trength.&mdash; Thou ha&s;t bro't them in, and planted them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou ha&s;t made for thee to dwell in, in the &s;anctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have e&s;tabli&s;hed. The Lord &s;hall reign forever and ever".</P>
<P>OUR fathers, after their coming into this land, were at fir&s;t, and for many years, in &s;traits and difficulties, and at times much put to it even for the nece&s;&s;aries of life. But as they tru&s;ted in GOD, he appeared for their help, and made provi&s;ion for their &s;up|port, in ways as extraordinary, as unexpected.</P>
<P>OUR fathers, after their &s;ettlement in this land, were &s;ometimes in great di&s;tre&s;s from the &s;avages that invaded them, and threat|ned their de&s;truction. And had it not been for marvellous protections afforded to them by GOD almighty, they mu&s;t have peri&s;hed by the hands of the&s;e enemies. They might with great propriety have adopted tho&s;e words of the P&s;almi&s;t, "If it had not been the Lord who was on our &s;ide, when men ro&s;e up again&s;t us, then they had &s;wallowed
<PB N="15" REF="011599_0014_0F877967D9D6BF00">
us up quick, when their wrath was kindled again&s;t us.&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth. &mdash;Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth".</P>
<P>OUR fathers, even after they had, in a good mea&s;ure, &s;ubdued this wilderne&s;s-coun|try, enlarging their borders, increa&s;ing in numbers, and in a plenty of the comforts of life, and, at the &s;ame time, adding &s;trength and glory to the Briti&s;h crown, were hardly dealt with by tho&s;e who had the govern|ment in their hands. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following &s;ummary of the tyrannical op|pre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e days will not be e&s;teemed a mi&s;repre&s;entation, as it is taken from the hi&s;tory of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, wrote by his honor, our pre&s;ent commander in chief. "Nero (pag. 355.) concealed his tyrannical di&s;po&s;ition more years than Sir Edmund, and his creatures, did months. It was not long before the ca&s;e of &s;ome, who apprehended them&s;elves oppre&s;&s;ed, came under con&s;ideration; one of the Council told them, that they mu&s;t not think the privile|ges of Engli&s;hmen would follow them to the end of the world. This gave an alarm thro' the government.&mdash;One of the fir&s;t acts of pow|er was the re&s;traint of the pre&s;s. Randolph [that tool of power] was the licen&s;er&mdash;A re|&s;traint upon marriages was more grievous. None were allowed to marry, except they entered into bonds, with &s;ureties to the Governor, to be for|feited in ca&s;e there &s;hould afterwards appear to have been any lawful impediment.&mdash;Sir Ed|mund con&s;idered the congregational mini&s;ters as meer laymen. Randolph wrote to the Bi|&s;hip of London, "I pre&s;s for able and &s;ober mini&s;ters, and we will contribute largely to their maintainance; but one thing will mainly help, when no marriages &s;hall hereafter be al|lowed lawful, but &s;uch as are made by the mini|&s;ters of the church of England.&mdash;The people (356, 537.) were menaced, that their meeting-hou&s;es &s;hould be taken from them, and that public wor&s;hip in the congregational way &s;hould not be tolerated.&mdash;Several churches had agreed to &s;et apart days of thank&s;giving for his Maje&s;ty's declaration for liberty of con&s;cience. The Go|vernor forbad them.&mdash;He told them, they &s;hould meet at their peril, and that he &s;hould &s;end &s;ol|diers to guard their meeting-hou&s;es.&mdash;Swearing by the book (pag. 358.) which had never been practi&s;ed, was now introduced; and &s;uch as &s;crupled it were fined and impri&s;oned.&mdash;The fees to all officers were exorbitant. Fifty Shil|lings [money of that day] was the common &s;ee for probate of a will. The Governor was &s;upreme ordinary, and acted by him&s;elf.&mdash;It was a great burden upon widows and children, who lived remote, to be obliged to come to Bo&s;ton for every part of bu&s;ine&s;s relative to the &s;ettlement of e&s;tates. The fees of all other officers were complained of as oppre&s;&s;ive. THE HARPIES THEMSELVES QUARRELLED ABOUT THEIR SHARE OF THE PREY.&mdash; But the greate&s;t profit (pag. 359) aro&s;e from patents for lands. The Charter being vacated, the people were told that their titles to their e&s;tates were of no va|lue.&mdash;It was made public, that all who would acknowledge the in&s;ufficiency of their title, de|rived from the former government, by petition|ing for new patents, &s;hould be quieted upon rea&s;onable terms.&mdash;In the complaint to King James, it is alledged, that the fees of &s;ome amounted to Fifty Pounds.&mdash;Men's titles were not que&s;tioned all at once. Had this been the ca&s;e, according to the computation then made, all the per&s;onal e&s;tate in the colony would not have paid the charge of the patents.&mdash;The Go|vernor (pag. 361) with four or five of his Coun|cil laid what taxes they thought proper. This the people complained of as their greate&s;t griev|ance. They thought them&s;elves INTITLED TO THE LIBERTIES AND IMMUNITIES OF FREE AND NATURAL BORN ENGLISH SUBJECTS, and con&s;equently that NO MONIES OUGHT TO BE RAISED FROM THEM BUT BY THEIR RE|PRESENTATIVES".</P>
<P>The&s;e, and &s;uch like in general, were the &s;uffer|ings of our fathers, under the admini&s;tration of Sir Edmund, "who knew too well the di&s;po&s;i|tion of his ma&s;ter to give him any concern about the complaints preferred again&s;t him": But they were the occa&s;ion of a revolution here about the &s;ame time, the revolution took place in England; a general account only of which would take up more room than can be here &s;pared.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only &s;ubjoin that ob&s;ervable remark of our honourable commander in chief, in a note at the bottom of page 391. "Of all that were con|cerned in the late government [Sir Edmund's] Mr. DUDLEY felt mo&s;t of the people's re&s;ent|ment. Oppre&s;&s;ion is le&s;s grievous from a &s;tran|ger than one of our own country". He further &s;ays, in the words of Danforth to I. Mather, "Mr. Dudley is, in a peculiar manner, the object of the people's di&s;plea&s;ure &mdash;They deeply re&s;ent his corre&s;pondence with that WICKED RANDOLPH for overturning the government.</P></NOTE> Their charter rights

She married COUNT PALATINE of the Rhine; and in her day the whole Palatinate (who were PROTES|TANTS) &s;uffered greatly, in con&s;equence of the exerci&s;e of catholic tyranny. It was rea&s;ona|bly expected her own father would have afford|ed her needed help; but &s;he had no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him. The famous Dr. Pre&s;ton, ma&s;ter of Emanuel-College in Cambridge, and chap|lain in ordinary to his then Maje&s;ty King James, in a Sermon, preached in his hearing, has the&s;e ob&s;ervable words (pag. 52), directed to tho&s;e who had great power, and opportuni|ty of doing good, "Let them con&s;ider that ex|cellent &s;peech of Mordacai to E&s;ther, (chap. 4. v. 24.) <HI>If thou hold thy tongue at this time, delive|rance &s;hall appear to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy hou&s;e &s;hall peri&s;h.</HI> The meaning is this; then there was an opportunity of doing good to the church. Therefore, &s;aith he, if thou do not do it, thou and thy hou&s;e &s;hall peri&s;h.

Some, perhaps, may look upon this as a prophetic &s;peech, and remarkably fulfilled, when they are told, that Charles the Fir&s;t, King James's Son, was awfully beheaded; and that James the Second, his Grand&s;on, abdicated the throne, upon which, after the death of Queen Ann, George the Fir&s;t was &s;eated, in whole fa|mily the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion has run on to this day.</NOTE>

<P>THE religious and civil liberties and pri|vileges, both of the mother-country and the American colonies, were nearly and clo&s;ely connected with this &s;ignal interpo&s;i|tion of that GOD, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who&s;e kingdom is an ever|la&s;ting kingdom, and who&s;e dominion ruleth over all. Had it not been for this marvel|lous appearance of divine providence, in favor of the people in Old, as well as in New-England, they would have been go|verned, not by law, but by &s;overeign will, ab&s;olute plea&s;ure; that is, in plain words, they would, in&s;tead of being free-men, have been made abject &s;laves. That was the language of our pious fathers, both at home and in this country, upon this great and never to be forgotten deliverance, "The Lord is our &s;trength and refuge, our &s;hield and defence. The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad. A&s;cribe

<P>IN a word, our fathers, as they tru&s;ted in GOD, were favored with many deliverances from great dangers, and heavily pre&s;&s;ing difficulties; and in a manner, &s;ometimes, peculiarly &s;triking and &s;urprizing. Perhaps it cannot be &s;aid of any deliverances, wrought out for any people, tho&s;e excepted which GOD wrought out for his I&s;rael of old, that they were more &s;ignally great and glorious than tho&s;e, in which he made his arm bare for the &s;alvation of our fathers in this land. "He made them to go forth like &s;heep, and guided them in the wilderne&s;s like a flock; and he led them on &s;afely, and brought them to the place his right-hand had purcha&s;ed for them. He ca&s;t out the heathen before them, and divided them an inheritance as it were by line: Yea, he drove out the hea|then with his hand, and planted them; he afflicted the people and ca&s;t them out. For they got not this land in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion with their own &s;word, neither did their own arm &s;ave them, but the right-hand and arm of GOD, and the light of his countenance, becau&s;e he had a favor for them".</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="011599_0021_0F87796DD9586B28">THUS we have &s;een, that our forefathers "tru&s;ted in GOD", and that GOD, in con&s;e|quence of this their piety towards him, wrought out deliverance for them.</P>
<P>THE way is now prepared, according to the method at fir&s;t laid out, to point out to us their po&s;terity our duty in this day of trou|ble, and the good effect we may humbly look for from the faithful performance of it.</P>
<P>IT is our lot, my hearers, to live in a time when the face of providence is angry and threatning. Our mother-country is in a &s;tate of great perplexity, difficulty, and confu&s;ion. If we may give credit to the accounts we have from home, complaints run high, un|ea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;content are grown general, in&s;omuch that, if GOD does not mercifully interpo&s;e, no one knows what may be the con&s;equence. And it is with us, in the&s;e American lands, a day of darkne&s;s, a day wherein we are called to put on &s;ackcloth. We are out of favor with our &s;overeign, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e who &s;tand round his throne; tho' it is an alleviation of our unhappine&s;s, that their di&s;plea&s;ure is owing to injurious repre&s;entations, repeatedly and wickedly made to our di&s;advantage.&mdash;The re&s;traints we are under as to the exerci&s;e of &s;ome of

our rights and privileges are grievous; and the more &s;o, as they were the purcha&s;e of our fathers at the ri&s;que of every thing near and dear to them, their lives not excepted.&mdash; In return for the part we chearfully bore in the late gloriou&s;ly &s;ucce&s;sful war, which emp|tied our pur&s;es, brought upon us an heavy debt, and occa&s;ioned a much greater lo&s;s of our young men, the flower and glory of the country, than was ever known before; I &s;ay, in return for this expence of blood and trea|&s;ure, from which we expected to reap great benefit, new duties have been impo&s;ed on us, and without any to repre&s;ent our per&s;ons in parliament, or to act in our behalf; new officers have been appointed, and a nume|rous train of them too, with enormous &s;ti|pends for this part of the world, and to be paid out of our pockets; in con&s;equence of which our trade was never before &s;o incum|bered with difficulties, never &s;o loaded with charges, and never &s;o ob&s;tructed in its ope|ration.&mdash;And we have, in a mea&s;ure, been treated as tho' we were rebels; otherwi&s;e, what occa&s;ion could there be for this metro|polis to be, as it were, garri&s;on'd with the King's troops, to the infinite hurt of the morals of its inhabitants, and to their being in a variety of ways in&s;ulted, injured, and a|bu&s;ed? But it would be needle&s;s to enlarge in a detail of hard&s;hips we are all know|ing

to, from what we have already felt, or are now groaning under: Nor &s;hall I incur the charge of going out of my line, by en|tering upon a political con&s;ideration of what may be thought the true &s;ource of tho&s;e diffi|culties which make the pre&s;ent, a day of trouble. Tis certainly the truth of fact, however the right of taxation be determi|ned, that we are in a perplext &s;ituation.</P>
<P>AND our duty is, after the example of our Fathers, in like circum&s;tances, to "tru&s;t in GOD". He only is the ultimate object of dependance. On him alone can we &s;ecure|ly rely for the &s;alvation our ca&s;e calls for In vain will it be to look to the hills and to the mountains, to &s;econd cau&s;es of whatever kind or nature; for they are nothing, and can affect nothing, without him, to the neg|lect of him, much le&s;s in oppo&s;ition to him. The &s;criptures are accordingly filled with calls to tru&s;t in GOD, e&s;pecially in a day of trou|ble. And we are there told, that "it is bet|ter to tru&s;t in the Lord than to put confi|dence in man"; that "it is better to tru&s;t in the Lord than to put confidence in Princes". Yea, we are there warned again&s;t placing our confidence in any being below the one true and living GOD, "the Lord Jehovah, in whom is everla&s;ting &s;trength". Yea, fur|ther, we have &s;uch a &s;olemn denunciation as
<PB N="25" REF="011599_0024_0F877970DF155A08">
that, "cur&s;ed is the man who tru&s;teth in man, who maketh fle&s;h his arm", that is, in oppo&s;ition to GOD, without a becoming &s;ub|&s;erviency to the will and plea&s;ure of the almighty Ruler of the world.</P>
<P>IT is therefore our duty, nor can we do any thing better, under our pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances, than to put our tru&s;t in GOD. And if we do this with humble reverence; with all due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the &s;overeign alwi&s;e, dominion of providence; and in the u&s;e of &s;uch means as are rea&s;onable and ju&s;t, and will be &s;o accounted by "the righteous LORD who loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s", we may hope to be delivered out of all our troubles. This was the good effect con&s;equent upon our father's tru&s;ting in GOD. "They tru&s;ted", and GOD "delivered them". And he is the &s;ame almighty good GOD now, that he was in their day. "His arm is not &s;hortned that it can|not &s;ave".</P>
<P>THE grounds upon which we may hope for deliverance, if we tru&s;t in GOD, are &s;uch as render all fear of being either a&s;hamed or di&s;appointed, needle&s;s and unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>GOD has abundantly declared, in the re|velation he has made of his purpo&s;es, that he will be the deliverer of tho&s;e that &s;utably

repair to him as their &s;upreme refuge, and all-&s;ufficient help. The texts to this pur|po&s;e are &s;cattered all over the bible. Hence the prayer of David, recorded in P&s;al. 17.7.&mdash;"O thou that &s;ave&s;t, by thy right hand, them that put their tru&s;t in thee,&mdash;hide me under the &s;hadow of thy wings from the wicked that oppre&s;s me, from my deadly enemies who compa&s;s me about: they are in|clo&s;ed in their own fat; with their mouths they &s;peak proudly.&mdash;Ari&s;e, O Lord, deli|ver my &s;oul from the wicked". Hence al|&s;o tho&s;e words in the 33. P&s;al. v. 20. "Be|hold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that hope in his mercy, to deliver their &s;oul from death. Our &s;oul waiteth for the Lord: He is our help and &s;hield. Our heart &s;hall re|joice in him, becau&s;e we have tru&s;ted in his holy name. Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us according as we hope in thee. In like manner, it is &s;aid P&s;al. 37. "The &s;al|vation of the righteous is of the Lord: he is their &s;trength in the time of trouble. And the Lord &s;hall help them and deliver them; he &s;hall deliver them from the wicked, and &s;ave them, becau&s;e they tru&s;t him".</P>
<P>AND this GOD that has engaged delive|rance to tho&s;e who &s;utably depend on him for it, is abundantly able to fulfill his word and promi&s;e. For he is infinite in the per|fections

of his nature; in wi&s;dom, know|ledge, power, faithfulne&s;s, and good|ne&s;s. No ob&s;tacles are the lea&s;t hindrance to him. All nature is at his command, all &s;econd cau&s;es, whether phy&s;ical, or moral; and he can make ju&s;t what u&s;e of them he plea&s;es in accompli&s;hing his own purpo&s;es. He can bring to nought the mo&s;t deep laid coun&s;els; overruling them to his own glory, and the good of tho&s;e again&s;t whom they are de&s;igned. The hearts of men, the greate&s;t as well as the lea&s;t, are known to him, and ab&s;olutely under his controul; and he can, whenever he plea&s;es, "turn them even as the rivers of waters are turned". No devices of men, whether high or low, can take effect in contradiction to his alwi&s;e plea|&s;ure. There are a thou&s;and ways in which he can defeat them; yea, he can employ the wor&s;t and mo&s;t powerful evil devi&s;ers, as in&s;truments to confound their own de|&s;igns, and bring the contrary to what they intended into effect. In &s;hort, all the wi&s;dom and power of heaven and earth, of all angels and all men, are under the government of GOD; and he can make u&s;e of it all, &s;hould he think fit to employ their in&s;trumentality, in working out &s;alvation for his people that truly tru&s;t in him: Yea, he could invert the cour&s;e of nature, &s;top the &s;un in its cour&s;e, commi&s;&s;ion the &s;tars to fight, and interpo&s;e

He can with infinite ea&s;e, in oppo&s;ition to earth and hell, defend and &s;ave tho&s;e that make him their &s;trength and refuge.</P>
<P>LET us then, my brethren, ca&s;t all our care and fear on the Lord. Let us make GOD the ultimate object of our dependance; looking above all &s;econd cau&s;es; not "tru&s;t|ing in man, who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils", and can do nothing but in &s;ub&s;erviency to the governing wi&s;dom of that providence which extends over all human affairs.</P>
<P>ONLY, let me remind you of one thing, which ought never to be forgotten, and that is; that our tru&s;t in GOD mu&s;t be accompa|nied with repentance, evidencing its genuine reality by an amendment of our doings which have not been right, and obedience to the voice of the Lord. We &s;hall only pre|&s;ume, if we pretend to tru&s;t in GOD, while we go on in our &s;ins, and refu&s;e to be reclai|med. A pious tru&s;t in GOD, and impeni|tence in &s;in, are utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with each other. We cannot in a truly religious way, make GOD our refuge, while we retain a
<PB N="29" REF="011599_0028_0F8779751A38B520">
love to our &s;ins, and will not be prevailed on to part with them.</P>
<P>AND here you will permit me to &s;ay, our &s;ins are the wor&s;t enemies we have. They are, properly &s;peaking, the true moral cau&s;e of all that we now &s;uffer, or have rea&s;on to fear. We may a&s;cribe the ill &s;tate of our affairs to this or the other &s;econd cau&s;e. We may a&s;cribe it to mi&s;repre&s;entations &s;ent to the mother-country by tho&s;e, in this, who &s;eek their own, not the welfare of the pub|lic; We may a&s;cribe it to the pride, the re|&s;entment, the hatred of men at home, clo|thed with dignity and honor; we may a&s;cribe it to a malignant &s;pirit in &s;ome, who cannot be ea&s;ie without having the pur&s;es of the colonies &s;ubjected to their arbitrary plea&s;ure. But if any &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e our difficulties may, in any mea&s;ure, be owing to the&s;e, or &s;uch like cau&s;es, it mu&s;t be &s;aid, they are only &s;econdary ones, &s;uperintended and go|verned by the great Ruler of the world. Men can do nothing without GOD. And whatever difficulties, hard&s;hips, and &s;uffer|ings they may be the occa&s;ion of, they are only in&s;truments in the hands of providence. GOD ultimately is the inflicter of the&s;e evils; and he would neither inflict, or permit the infliction of them, but on account of the &s;ins of tho&s;e who &s;uffer by them. Our &s;ins
<PB N="30" REF="011599_0029_0F877975809D1EA8">
therefore, in the la&s;t re&s;ult, are the alone cau&s;e of whatever troubles we groan under. In&s;tead therefore of reflecting blame on GOD, we &s;hould blame our&s;elves; and in truth, we have much more rea&s;on to blame our|&s;elves for our &s;ins, than to blame even the &s;econdary cau&s;es of our &s;uffering.</P>
<P>IF then we would tru&s;t in GOD, &s;o as to &s;ecure his favor, and obtain the deliverance we need, we mu&s;t make him our refuge in the way of repentance and reformation; humbling our&s;elves in a &s;en&s;e of our multi|plied offences committed again&s;t the maje&s;ty of heaven, and re&s;olving, in the &s;trength of divine grace, that wherein we have done ini|quity we will do &s;o no more. If we would hope, upon ju&s;t grounds, to be a happy peo|ple, and to have continued to us tho&s;e inva|luable rights and liberties that have been tran&s;mitted to us from our fathers, we mu&s;t be imitators of their virtue, tru&s;t in GOD in a way of repentance, and a due care to live in the world piou&s;ly, righteou&s;ly, and &s;ober|ly, as the grace of GOD, in the go&s;pel, has taught us to do, and is ready to enable us to do. If we are but once effectually wrought upon to renounce our &s;ins, and walk in new|ne&s;s of life, ordering our conver&s;ation, not by fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, but by the grace of GOD, we may humbly hope, that GOD will be for

The things that, to human appearance, are again&s;t us &s;hall in the end turn out to our advan|tage. GOD can make the mo&s;t adver&s;e &s;tate of affairs work out our be&s;t good; and he will certainly do it, if we love him with all our hearts, and &s;erve him with all our might, conforming our&s;elves to the directions of his word. While we tru&s;t in the perfections of almighty GOD, in the way of doing our duty to him, we need not fear, however dark and melancholly the face of providence may ap|pear for the pre&s;ent. For GOD will be our help. And "happy are they who have the GOD of Jacob for their help, who&s;e hope is in the Lord their GOD". While we thus &s;et our hope in him, we may triumph and &s;ing, "the Lord is my light and my &s;alvation, whom &s;hall I fear? The Lord is the &s;trength of my life, of whom &s;hall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies, came upon me to eat up my fle&s;h, they &s;tumbled and fell.

For it is undoubtedly the truth of fact, that his Maje&s;ty has no &s;ubjects, in any part of his extended dominions, that would more readily venture their lives and fortunes in defence of his per&s;on, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in his royal hou&s;e, and his government within the bounds of the engli&s;h con&s;titution, than we in the MASSACHUSETS-PROVINCE, not|with&s;tanding the ba&s;e and fal&s;e repre&s;en|tations which have occa&s;ioned his Maje&s;ty, and many of his mini&s;ters, to look up|on us with a jealous and angry eye. GOD forgive tho&s;e lovers of them&s;elves in oppo&s;ition to their King and country, who, from &s;elfi&s;h views, have repre&s;ented this people as di&s;po&s;ed to trea&s;on and rebellion. Let us, my brethren, notwith&s;tanding the malice of our enemies, and their unwearied attempts, to impre&s;s the mind of our So|vereign, by communications to his mini|&s;ters, with an ill opinion of us; let us, I &s;ay, go on, as we have hitherto con&s;tantly done, to "make &s;upplications, prayers, interce&s;&s;i|ons, with giving of thanks", for the King as &s;upreme, and for all in authority under him", that by means of their wi&s;e, gen|tle, and ju&s;t admini&s;trations in government, "we may lead quiet and peceable lives in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty".</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="011599_0037_0F87797CDA4C3550">AND may we all &s;o conduct in the va|rious &s;tations and relations we &s;u&s;tain in life, as that we may honour GOD, &s;erve our generation according to his will, and finally be accounted worthy of an ad|mi&s;&s;ion into that kingdom that is above, where we &s;hall dwell in love and peace, without &s;in or &s;orrow, through the never|ending ages of a ble&s;&s;ed eternity.</P>
<P>Now to the "ble&s;&s;ed and only poten|tate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, of whom, and through whom, and to whom, are all things, be honor and power everla&s;ting". AMEN.</P>
