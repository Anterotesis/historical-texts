<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. PRESIDENT, GENTLEMEN OF THE SOCIETY, AND FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN addre&s;&s;ing a &s;ociety in&s;tituted for the benevolent pur|po&s;e of promoting the freedom of mankind, SLAVERY will be the proper theme of contemplation. So many vo|lumes have been written on this &s;ubject, that nothing new can be expected; yet the &s;ubject ought never to be deem|ed exhau&s;ted, while an individual of the human race is groaning in the &s;hackles of &s;ervitude. The Divine, the Philo&s;opher, and the Poet, have united in reprobating the impiety, demon&s;trating the immorality, and de&s;cribing the cruelty, of this practice. No writer of genius and &s;en&s;ibility, has ever avowed the doctrine, and attempted its ju&s;tification and &s;upport. Yet avarice has continued the practice in de&s;iance of the cleare&s;t dictates of rea&s;on, and the mo&s;t vigorous efforts of learning and humanity. The liberty, and happine&s;s, of a large portion of the hu|man race, are &s;acrificed at the thrine of pride, ambition, and cruelty. One quarter of the globe has been depopula|ted
<PB N="4" REF="023816_0004_0FC137D7C08BE480">
by furni&s;hing &s;laves for another. This reflection ex|cites the keene&s;t pain when we con&s;ider that it is the pride, and the boa&s;t of this enlightened age, to excel former times in the improvements of literature, the refinement of man|ners, and the practice of the gentle and &s;ocial virtues.</P>
<P>SUCH di&s;tant pro&s;pects of human woe can hardly be re|alized by per&s;ons who live in a country, where the con&s;ti|tution of government, the &s;y&s;tem of law, and the admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice, &s;ecure to every member of the commu|nity the highe&s;t political felicity. But America, the ori|gin and theatre of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;lavery known in any country, has peculiar rea&s;ons to attend to this alarm|ing &s;ubject, In America we have made unparrallelled ex|ertions in the defence of the rights of man, and the acqui&s;i|tion of liberty and independence. On any part of this quarter of the globe &s;hall we permit an unparrallelled vi|olation of tho&s;e rights, &s;o ine&s;timable in the eyes of all mankind?</P>
<P>TO excite the &s;entiments of humanity, and animate us to a performance of our duty, let us conci&s;ely trace the hi&s;tory of &s;lavery from the earlie&s;t period, to the pre&s;ent time. In exploring the records of pa&s;t ages we are &s;truck with the melancholy reflection, that hi&s;tory is chiefly em|ployed in detailing the mi&s;eries, that one part of mankind indict upon the other. Men in their mo&s;t unpoli&s;hed &s;tare of &s;implicity, and barbarity, are in perpetual warfare and contention. Remote&s;t hi&s;tory &s;hews them divided into &s;mall tribes, inflamed again&s;t each other with the bittere&s;t animo&s;ity, and delighting in deeds of heroi&s;m and martial enterpri&s;es&mdash;Prompted by revenge they frequently engage in the fierce&s;t conflicts. Strangers to the feeble voice of pity, they exercise the &s;evere&s;t cruelties toward their pri|&s;oners&mdash;and tho&s;e who e&s;cape the &s;troke of death are re|duced to the mo&s;t ignominious &s;lavery. The claim found|ed on the pretended right of conque&s;t is unque&s;tionably the origin of the practice and a practice that originates from the inhuman maxims of a barbarous age is contin|ued, and becomes e&s;tablished, in the progre&s;s to civili|zation, and government. New modes of acqui&s;ition are introduced, and the power is protected by force of law. The offspring of &s;laves are doomed to follow the condition of their unhappy parents, and when the events of war fail of furni&s;hing the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, a mart is opened for
<PB N="5" REF="023816_0005_0FC137E173E02E90">
the fale of rational beings. The&s;e remarks are verified by the Grecian and Roman &s;tory. While tho&s;e repub|lics, &s;o long erioneou&s;ly celebrated as the mo&s;t excel|lent models of a free government, were exulting in the exerci&s;e of political liberty, they unju&s;tly withheld from the greater part of the people inhabiting their territories the &s;ame invaluable ble&s;&s;ing, and &s;ubjected them to all the &s;everity of dome&s;tic &s;lavery. When the iron hand of de&s;poti&s;m had cru&s;hed the liberties of the&s;e republicks, and the Roman emperors tyrannized over the greate&s;t part of the civilized world, this practice was not only continued, but was confirmed and guarded by &s;enatorial decrees, and imperial edicts. The laws of the Roman republic, and empire, delegated to the matter an ab&s;o|lute power over the &s;lave. The &s;tare in legal con&s;idera|tion was deemed the property of the ma&s;ter as much as the bea&s;t of the field; and expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t rigorous puni&s;hment, and excruciating torture, which whim, rage, and revenge could dictate. The &s;exes were re&s;tricted in forming that endearing connection, which might in &s;ome mea&s;ure have alleviated their wretchedne&s;s&mdash;No marriages were permitted, unle&s;s the ma&s;ter was de&s;irous of propagating &s;laves; and then the connection was founded upon his will, instead of the inclination of the parties. The ma&s;ter at plea&s;ure with his own hand took away the life of a &s;lave, without any form of trial; and without being re&s;pon&s;ible to any tribunal. If any of the&s;e wretches e&s;caped the unrelenting hand of their ty|rants, and &s;urvived the period of their u&s;efulne&s;s, or by &s;ickne&s;s were rendered incapable of labor, they were expo&s;ed helple&s;s, and alone, on an i&s;land in the Tiber, to peri&s;h by cold, and hunger. But to compleat our view of this iniquitous &s;y&s;tem of &s;lavery, we mu&s;t take into con&s;ideration the combats of the Gladiators&mdash;The&s;e were &s;laves who were trained for the parpo&s;e of furni&s;h|ing a barbarous &s;pectacle that could only he reli&s;hed by a people who haw retined upon the principles of cruelty. The &s;ame Romans who were animated by the &s;ublime eloquence of Cicero, who were charmed by the tender &s;entiments of Virgil, who were amu&s;ed with the plea&s;|ing &s;trains of Horace, and who were corrupted by the wanton de&s;criptions of Ovid, crouded. the amphitheatre to behold their fellow men &s;truggling in mortal fight; and &s;miled at their bravery, and heroi&s;m, exulted at their groans of angui&s;h, and be&s;towed the loude&s;t acclamations
<PB N="6" REF="023816_0006_0FC137E3E669FFE8">on tho&s;e who met the fatal &s;troke, in the mo&s;t elegant po&s;ture, and graceful manner.</P>
<P>WHILE the Roman Emperors were &s;porting with the happine&s;s, and trampling on the privileges of mankind, the barbarians of the North i&s;&s;ued from their frozen re|gions, &s;ubverted the Roman empire and avenged the in|jured rights of humanity. The followers of Odin de&s;ert|ed their native wilds, and barren fore&s;ts, for the cultivated fields and flowery gardens of Italy: they exchanged the bloody <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ites, and horrid &s;uper&s;titions of the Druids, for the rational principles, and mild doctrines of chri&s;tianity; they abandoned their &s;acred altars, and con&s;ecrated groves, for the &s;ublime ceremonies, and &s;plendid magnificence of the church. The conquerors were incorporated with the conquered; new forms of government aro&s;e, the laws were changed, and the feudal &s;y&s;tem was e&s;tablished: yet &s;lavery maintained its ground, accompanied with all its horrors and cruelty.</P>
<P>BUT when the pure, and peaceable religion, of the meek and lowly JESUS, which taught the original equality of mankind, and brought life, and immortality to light, had &s;pread its divine influence, a new aera commenced. The value of man was enlarged upon the &s;cale of chri&s;tian|ity, and it was deemed impious to treat a candidate for eternal happine&s;s, in the character of a brute. The clergy exerted that amazing influence which they had obtained over mankind, in procuring for &s;laves their per&s;onal free|dom. But &s;o gradual is the progre&s;s of truth, and &s;o dif|ficult the abolition of long e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms, founded on the apparent intere&s;t of the mo&s;t influential part of the community, that &s;everal centuries elap&s;ed before the ex|tinction of dome&s;tic &s;lavery was accompli&s;hed in it's pre|&s;ent extent; for in &s;ome parts of Europe dome&s;tic &s;lavery is not wholly extirpated.</P>
<P>IT will not be pretended that the introduction of chri&s;|tianity, was the &s;ole cau&s;e of this happy revolution. Other cau&s;es unque&s;tionably combined th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> effects in producing this &s;alutary event. It is certain however that this reli|gion fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of the wickedne&s;s, and inju&s;tice of the practice. It opened the door, and led the way, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of &s;laves. It's benevolent &s;pirit pre|pared the mind, to acquire and practice upon principles
<PB N="7" REF="023816_0007_0FC137EAAD270560">
that would terminate in the gradual abolition of &s;ervitude. When it was by experience di&s;covered, that liberty was productive of the greate&s;t political happine&s;s to the com|munity, intere&s;t co-operated with religion to e&s;tabli&s;h it upon the ruins of &s;lavery. Before the promulgation of the chri&s;tian religion, there exi&s;ted the &s;ame political, and moral cau&s;es, to produce the abolition of this cu&s;tom. Yet in pagan times, neither the voice of religion, or phi|lo&s;ophy was heard in defence of the violated rights of hu|manity. We have therefore a right to &s;ay, that if the chri&s;tian religion had never been promulgated, dome&s;tic &s;lavery had never been aboli&s;hed. It may claim the hon|our of originating in Europe, a political revolution of the greate&s;t importance to the welfare of mankind. Such ben|eficial con&s;equences, though of a temporal nature, are a conclu&s;ive evidence, that the religion from whence they flow is the gift of heaven.</P>
<P>WHILE the &s;acred light of the go&s;pel was diffu&s;ing it&s;elf through the world, and meliorating the condition of man, a new religion broke forth from the Ea&s;t. Endowed with the bolde&s;t genius and mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, the Pro|phet of Arabia with the &s;word and koran denounced death or &s;lavery again&s;t his oppo&s;ers, and promi&s;ed to his fol|lowers, eternal rewards of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, in the arms of beauty, in the gardens of paradi&s;e. The Caliph's dif|fu&s;ed their religion, and extended their empire, with a rapidity never before known; and they threatened Eu|rope with the danger of turning the cour&s;e of their pilgrimages, from the tomb of Jeru&s;alem, to the Caa|ba of Mecca&mdash;The religion of the koran is as repug|nant, as the religion of the bible is favourable, to hu|man happine&s;s. The mo&s;lems filled with a &s;upreme con|tempt for all other religions, and in&s;pired with an in|vincible zeal to propagate their own, have di&s;played the cre&s;cent on the greater part of the ea&s;tern continent, and have reduced to &s;lavery the conquered nation who re|jected the faith of their prophet and the laws of the ko|ran. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of polygamy has degraded the female &s;ex from companions to &s;laves, and doom'd them to wa&s;te their youth, and beauty, in the gloomy man|&s;ions of the Seraglio. A &s;tate very different from what the lovely &s;ex enjoy in this country, where in con&s;e|quence of their freedom, they exhibit the gentle vir|tues in their mo&s;t amiable light, and give the highe&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="023816_0008_0FC137EDD98B2388">poli&s;h to our manners, and the pure&s;t joy to dome&s;tic life. The Turks, who conquered the empire and bow|ed to the religion of Mahomet, have exhibited the blacke&s;t picture of human woe, and infamy, in the &s;ame countries, which once were the mo&s;t &s;plendid theatre of human glory and felicity. While chri&s;tianity was gradual|ly aboli&s;hing dome&s;tic &s;lavery, I&s;lamism was &s;triving to riv|et its &s;hackles on all the nations of the earth. The&s;e piratical barbarians were perpetually making incur&s;ions into tho&s;e chri&s;tian countries, that were &s;truggling for per&s;onal freedom; and plundered from the inhabitants the children of both &s;exes, to recruit the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nds of the Janizaries, and multiply, and vary the wanton plea&s;ures of the lords of the Harems. In that unhappy country there is no pro&s;pect of re&s;toring the rights of the peo|ple, unle&s;s by the utter extinction of the religion and government. Perhaps this event may not be far di&s;tant. Perhaps the inhabitants of the North will effect anoth|er revolution in the South, and the Ottoman empire fall by a female hand. Perhaps the imperial Catharine will di&s;play the Ru&s;&s;ian Eagle on the walls of Con&s;tantino|ple, bani&s;h the Turki&s;h cre&s;cent to the de&s;erts of Ara|bia and abandoning the frozen &s;hores of the Baltic, e&s;tabli&s;h her throne on the verdant, and blooming bor|ders of the &s;ea of Marmara. Every benevolent mind wi&s;hes for the de&s;truction of a government that is cal|culated to render the &s;ubjects poor and mi&s;erable, to &s;uppre&s;s every principle that leads to improvement in manners, arts, and &s;ciences, and to convert the mo&s;t fertile countries into inho&s;pitable de&s;erts. The Euro|pean powers, actuated by narrow policy and illiberal jealou&s;y, are combining to &s;ave &s;uch a government from impending ruin, and to prevent the accompli&s;hment of an event, which would open to the curio&s;ity of the learned, the venerable remains of oriental antiquity.</P>
<P>BUT we are to con&s;ider dome&s;tic &s;lavery in tho&s;e countries where there is a po&s;&s;ibility, that our exertions may furni&s;h relief. I have ob&s;erved that in the chri&s;|tian kingdoms of Europe, this cu&s;tom was nearly abol|i&s;hed. It is remarkable that this event happened in Europe about the time of the di&s;covery of America&mdash;a period when this practice was introduced into that quarter of the world, under circum&s;tances of cruelty unknown to ancient nations. The black native of the
<PB N="9" REF="023816_0009_0FC137F574CCA9A0">burning climes of Africa, and the copper coloured &s;av|age of the wilds of America, have long mourned the day, when Columbus failed from Europe, on an enter|pri&s;e, which excited the wonder of his own, and has met with the applau&s;e of every &s;ucceeding age&mdash;An en|terpri&s;e which has been celebrated in the &s;ublime &s;trains of Barlow, who&s;e &s;ong will tran&s;mit the &s;ame of the hero, and the poet, to remote&s;t time.</P>
<P>AT this period America was peopled by a thou&s;and tribes, &s;peaking different languages, but all re&s;embling each other by their uniformity of manners, and &s;imilarity of complexion. Excepting in a few in&s;tances, they &s;eem|ed to be ju&s;t emerging from a &s;tate of nature, and were in that early age of &s;ociety, when they ranged the woods, and explored the &s;treams in pur&s;uit of prey, and fed at the table prepared for them by the hand of nature.&mdash;Like all &s;avage nations, addicted to war, they gloried in their ardent heroi&s;m in battle, their indefatigable per&s;e|verance in enterprize, their un&s;haken independence of mind, and their &s;upreme contempt of death. When re|venge did not prompt them to the field, nor hunger impel them to the cha&s;e, they devoted them&s;elves to the enjoy|ment of the Epicurean plea&s;ure, of <HI>indolence of body, and tranquility of mind.</HI> Di&s;daining to labour, they peaceably &s;lumbered away their time, while they devolved on their women the drudgeries of dome&s;tic life. A &s;tate of &s;ociety which the romantic philo&s;ophers Roffeau, and Raynal, have preferred to the luxurious refinements, and poli&s;hed plea&s;ures of civilized life.</P>
<P>SUCH was the &s;ituation of the country when the Spaniards appeared on the coa&s;t&mdash;a nation who&s;e avarice could be exceeded only by their inhumanity. Aided by the deci&s;ive &s;uperiority of their di&s;cipline, and the unknown thunder of their cannon, they impre&s;&s;ed univer|&s;al terror upon the defencele&s;s &s;avages, who fell an ea&s;y prey to their victorious arms, and irre&s;i&s;table valour. The generous heart revolts at the idea, of de&s;cribing the unparrallelled tortures, and agonies, which the&s;e people &s;uffered, and wi&s;hes for the honor of human nature, that they were blotted from the page of hi&s;tory, and obliter|ated from the memory of mankind. When the hand of de&s;truction was weary of its work, avarice &s;ugge&s;ted the
<PB N="10" REF="023816_0010_0FC137F68EE892F8">idea of compelling the &s;urvivors to labour for the benefit of their oppre&s;&s;ors. Dragged from their groves and &s;treams, where they had lived in idlene&s;s, and freedom, and immured in the dreary caverns of mountains, they were doomed to wa&s;te their lives in digging for tho&s;e pre|cious metals, who&s;e imaginary value has been the &s;ource of infinite mi&s;chief to mankind. Unaccu&s;tomed to fa|tigue, and by the imbecility of their con&s;titutions incapa|ble of &s;u&s;taining the rigor of &s;ervitude, they melted away beneath the rod of oppre&s;&s;ion, with the &s;ame rapidity as they had been exterminated by the &s;word. In their de|plorable &s;tate, an advocate appeared to plead their cau&s;e. Las Ca&s;ashas immortalized his name by his generous, but un&s;ucce&s;sful endeavours, to re&s;tore them to their natural rights in this world, and &s;ecure them eternal happine&s;s in the world to come. But the intere&s;ted views of his coun|trymen defeated all his benevolent plans, and induced them to adopt one of his propo&s;als, which in the ardor of his zeal he did not thoroughly con&s;ider. He approved of the expedient of &s;upplying the place of the Americans whom he wi&s;hed to emancipate, by the importation of African &s;laves. This &s;cheme was adopted, not with a view to relieve the Americans, but to recruit the country depopulated by rigor and cruelty, with a race of &s;laves, who by their &s;trength of body and vigor of con&s;titution &s;hould be capable of performing that hard &s;ervice which had proved &s;o fatal to the feebler &s;avages of America.&mdash;The Emperor Charles the Fifth, who by his frequent wars and barbarous per&s;ecution of the prote&s;tant religion, during his long reign had rendered his exten&s;ive domini|ons a theatre of human calamity, granted to one of his favourites, the privilege of tran&s;porting a number of Af|rican &s;laves to his American colonies. This &s;troke of in|human policy introduced the practice, and it has been fol|lowed by all the European powers who had &s;ettlements in America. For in America only has the African been deemed an article of property, and adjudged to have for|feited his natural rights, on account of the blackne&s;s of his complexion, and the inferiority of his intellectual ca|pacity.</P>
<P>THE untutored African was &s;afely &s;heltered in his na|tive woods, without fear of any foreign power till the time of the Portugue&s;e di&s;coveries. A &s;hort time after the &s;plendid adventure of Columbus, Va&s;co de Gama
<PB N="11" REF="023816_0011_0FC137F7EFA10228">
completed tho&s;e di&s;coveries by &s;teering round the Cape of Good Hope, and opening to his country the inexhau&s;tible riches of the Ea&s;t. This event produced a revolution that changed the channels of commerce, and poured upon Europe the delicacies, and luxuries of the Indus and the Ganges. The Portugue&s;e &s;ir&s;t imported the Africans into Europe, and made that mi&s;erable nation an article of traffic. They were followed by the Spani&s;h, and all the commercial nations, for the purpo&s;e of &s;upplying with &s;laves their American colonies. All eagerly engaged in a branch of trade that held out &s;uch lucrative profits as to &s;lifle the feeble voice of compa&s;&s;ion, and the un&s;upported claims of ju&s;tice. In this manner the di&s;covery of Ameri|ca has proved a mo&s;t calamitous event to Africa, and has extended the &s;lave trade to &s;uch a degree, as to call upon humanity, philo&s;ophy, and religion to combine their ex|ertions to aboli&s;h &s;o de&s;tructive a cu&s;tom. America is the only chri&s;tian country where dome&s;tic &s;lavery is tolerated in any considerable degree&mdash;May it be the glory of the pre&s;ent age to wipe away this reproach from our land.</P>
<P>To attempt a refutation of the arguments advanced in defence of this cu&s;tom, in this enlightened period, and to this re&s;pectable auditory, would be a u&s;ele&s;s labour. Dif|fimilarity of complexion and inferiority of mind are argu|ments &s;o far from ju&s;tifying this conduct, that they &s;erve to evince that the extreme ba&s;ene&s;s of the per&s;ons who advance them can only be exceeded by tho&s;e who carry them into practice, by taking an unfair advantage of the weak and defencele&s;s &s;tate of their fellow creatures, and doubling tho&s;e misfortunes which it is pretended they have inherited as their portion from the God of nature.</P>
<P>THAT the condition of the African is meliorated by removing him from his native wilds to the cultivated fields of America will appear to be fal&s;e upon an exami|nation of the fact. In their own country, before their re|treat was di&s;covered by the European merchants, the &s;av|ages of Africa lived in the exerci&s;e of that freedom and independence which are natural to their &s;tate in &s;ociety, and in the enjoyment of that repo&s;e and indolence which re&s;ulted from the warmth of their climate and the fertility of their foil. Tho destitute of the security of a well regu|lated government, and expo&s;ed to all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of fre|quent wars; yet from their innocence and &s;implicity of
<PB N="12" REF="023816_0012_0FC137F9704B1920">
manners they derived a felicity and tranquility of mind which are unknown to their barbarous oppre&s;&s;ors, and which perhaps fall not &s;o far &s;hort of the artificial plea&s;|ures of poli&s;hed life as pride and vanity have pretended&mdash;Such was their &s;ituation in their own country. Let us con&s;ider the &s;ituation in which they are placed by the &s;lave-trade. In order to realize the &s;ubject, let us con|template the &s;cene which is now taking place on the vari|ous parts of the earth&mdash;Let us extend our pro&s;pect at once to the whole globe, and comprehend in one view all the mi&s;eries of this unfortunate people.</P>
<P>FROM the ports of commercial nations &s;hips are con|&s;tantly &s;ailing to Africa, and the merchants at their ea&s;e are cooly calculating the accumulation of wealth which will accrue to them in proportion to the pain which they inflict upon their fellow men. On their arrival on the coa&s;t the natives are filled with fears and apprehen&s;ions of danger. As far through the country as the name of the white people has been heard, &s;o far the alarm is founded. Actuated by the hopes of gain, many of the natives are induced to engage in the trade, and become the in&s;tru|ments of reducing their wretched brethren to &s;lavery&mdash;They procure by theft or purcha&s;e, and &s;ell for a trifling compen&s;ation, per&s;ons of every age, &s;ex, and condition. When their cargo is completed the traders frequently clo&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s by detaining and carrying away tho&s;e very natives who have furni&s;hed them with their &s;laves&mdash;a ju&s;t puni&s;hment upon them for their barbarity, but which e|vinces our African traders to be as void of good faith as they are of humanity. Not only are individuals induced to commence robbers by this practice, but the kings and leaders of nations and tribes, are animated to undertake martial expeditions for the purpo&s;e of acquiring pri&s;oners to &s;ell for &s;laves. Through the barbarous realms of Afri|ca the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ble nations move from every &s;ide to mortal com|bat&mdash;the din of battle re&s;ounds&mdash;death and ruin mark their progre&s;s, and the vanqui&s;hed who are taken pri&s;on|ers are re&s;erved for di&s;tre&s;&s;es in compari&s;on with which death may be deemed a ble&s;&s;ing. The theft of the rob|ber and the depredation of the warrior extend to every quarter, and no place can be found for the enjoyment of &s;afety and repo&s;e. The father can never enjoy peace and tranquility in the bo&s;om of his family. He is hourly ex|po&s;ed to have his wife and children torn from his arms

and tran&s;ported to a country from whence they can never return. Such incidents &s;o frequently happen that they are the perpetual theme of conver&s;ation. They can re|peat a thou&s;and tales of the misfortunes of their friends and neighbours, which imprint the deepe&s;t gloom on their minds, and impre&s;s them with a con&s;tant fear and expecta|tion of &s;uffering &s;uch un&s;peakable calamities.</P>
<P>WHILE &s;uch horrors de&s;troy the tranquility of the in|terior parts of the country, behold on every hand innu|merable troops are de&s;cending to the ports frequented by the chri&s;tian traders. No language can de&s;cribe the an|gui&s;h and de&s;pair which they experience when they are dragged from their native land and deare&s;t friends, and tran&s;ported to the place where they are expo&s;ed to &s;ale. Imagine a father torn from the embraces of a di&s;tracted wife&mdash;children ravi&s;hed from the arms of their parents, and lovers compelled to bid each other an everla&s;ting fare|well. Perhaps they are all obliged to accompany each other in this &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s. Their tears, their lamen|tations and their intreaties would procure them relief were not the brea&s;ts of the traders &s;teeled again&s;t the &s;oft emo|tions of pity, and the generous &s;entiments of humanity. The&s;e victims of avarice are fold with le&s;s ceremony than the bea&s;ts of the field; they are &s;towed in the &s;hips in a mo&s;t uncomfortable &s;ituation, and loaded with &s;hackles of iron. The father hears by turns the groans of a belov|ed &s;on confined in chains, and the &s;creams of his faithful wife and innocent daughters, &s;truggling again&s;t the attacks of their brutal ravi&s;hers. Can there be a human heart that does not &s;often with compa&s;&s;ion at the cries of angui&s;h and exclamations of &s;orrow when the &s;hips depart from the coa&s;t&mdash;when the &s;laves take a la&s;t view of their native crimes, to which they have no hopes ever to return&mdash;when they bid an eternal adieu to all that is dear to them, and find them&s;elves involuntarily embarking on a voyage, the unknown terrors of which give full &s;cope to the mo&s;t gloomy exerci&s;e of the imagination. I &s;eem to hear the melancholy found of a thou&s;and voices united in deplor|ing their un&s;peakable calamities, and which re-echo for the la&s;t time in their native groves and wilds, which have often witne&s;&s;ed their joyous &s;ongs and innocent amu&s;e|ments. But the African coa&s;t &s;oon di&s;appears, and they pur&s;ue their trackle&s;s path, to the region de&s;tined to be the theatre of their wretchedne&s;s. In their pa&s;&s;age they form
<PB N="14" REF="023816_0014_0FC137FEA8647828">
&s;uch dreary ideas of their future condition, that they vol|untarily deprive them&s;elves of life to avoid approaching evil. Whenever they can break from their chains, ani|mated with the pro&s;pect of returning to their native coun|try, they plunge them&s;elves into the ocean, and terminate at once their lives and their misfortunes. Not only do the&s;e ignorant &s;avages put a period to their own exi&s;t|ence, but fired by rage and revenge they &s;ometimes bur&s;t the bands that confine them and imbrue their hands in the blood of their oppre&s;&s;ors. In&s;tances have happened where the whole crew have fell victims to the rage and &s;atiated the vengeance of their injured &s;laves. The Africans are there left alone in the &s;hip without a pilot to direct their cour&s;e. Imagine the horror of their condition&mdash;un&s;killed in the art of navigation&mdash;incapable of &s;teering the &s;hip, and driven before the winds they are expo&s;ed to the fury of the waves and depend on chance for relief. They wander round the ocean in the vain hopes of regaining their native &s;hore till their food becomes exhau&s;ted and they peri&s;h by the unrelenting <HI>hand of famine.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the traders e&s;cape the &s;torms of the ocean and the vengance of the Africans, and arrive in the We&s;t-India i&s;lands and tho&s;e countries where there is a demand for their cargo, the &s;ale of the&s;e unfortunate people com|pleats their wretchedne&s;s. In di&s;tributing them thro the plantations no regard is paid to the tender ties of con&s;angui|nity and the &s;acred bonds of friend&s;hip. They are com|pelled to undergo a &s;everity of &s;ervitude
unparalleled in the annals of mankind. They are doomed in the burn|ing climes beneath a meridian &s;un to ince&s;&s;ant labor and fatigue. When their &s;trength is exhau&s;ted, and they tot|ter under their burdens the la&s;h of the whip quickens them to the la&s;h exertion of expiring life. They are denied a &s;ufficient re&s;pite from their labors to re&s;t their weary limbs and enjoy the nece&s;&s;ary relaxation of <HI>repo&s;e.</HI> Their &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tance is in&s;ufficient to &s;upply the calls of nature and &s;atisfy the cravings of hunger. Not only do their unfeel|ing ma&s;ters refu&s;e them a participation of the fruits of their labor, but they &s;ubject them to torture and cruelty which render life intolerable and at which humanity &s;hudders. For the mo&s;t trivial offences they inflict upon them the mo&s;t barbarous puni&s;hments. In the&s;e countries nothing is more common than the &s;ound of the whip and the &s;creams and lamentations of the defencele&s;s &s;lays&mdash;when their bodies
<PB N="15" REF="023816_0015_0FC1380266FAF160">
are <HI>gored</HI> with <HI>wounds</HI> and the blood flows in &s;treams they are plunged into the ocean who&s;e waves &s;harpen the pains with the keene&s;t agony. Their barbarous oppre&s;&s;ors are &s;o far from compa&s;&s;ionating their &s;ufferings that they laugh at their mi&s;eries and mock at their calamities.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e people do not always tamely &s;ubmit to &s;uch unprovoked injuries. Sometimes the voice of revenge is heard among&s;t them&mdash;they &s;uddenly ru&s;h to arms and re|taliate upon their ma&s;ters all the cruelities they have re|ceived at their hands. Animated with &s;ury and hatred they deal promi&s;cuous de&s;truction on all their foes and the bloodie&s;t &s;cenes of civil war are di&s;played. They &s;pare neither age or &s;ex&mdash;the blooming virgin and the helple&s;s infant are involved in one common ruin. Whole families enjoying the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of affluence and happine&s;s are cut off at a &s;troke and &s;wept to the du&s;t&mdash;The ignorant in&s;urgents after a &s;hort gratification of their revenge are vanqui&s;hed and &s;ubjected to a repetition of cruelties be|yond the power of language to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>THIS unhappy nation exhau&s;ted by unremitting fatigue, depre&s;&s;ed by the rigor of &s;ervitude and debilitated by the &s;everity of puni&s;hment, drag on a melancholy uncomfor|table exi&s;tence &s;trangers to the plea&s;ures of life. Their on|ly con&s;olation is that the extreme torments they &s;uffer in this life remove all apprehen&s;ions about a future &s;tate, and di&s;arm death of tho&s;e terrors which make &s;uch an impre&s;|&s;ion upon the minds of the re&s;t of mankind, as to deprive them of the tran&s;itory plea&s;ures of living by the perpetual fears of dying. To them the pro&s;pect of terminating life furni&s;hes the plea&s;ing con&s;olation of terminating their wretchedne&s;s&mdash;To them the me&s;&s;enger of death is an angel of peace and they fondly believe that they &s;hall have a day of <HI>retribution</HI> in another exi&s;tence in their native land&mdash;The funeral rites of a &s;lave are performed by his brethren with every mark of joy and gladne&s;s&mdash;They accompany the cor&s;e with the &s;ound of mu&s;ical in&s;truments&mdash;They &s;ing their &s;ongs and perform their dances around the grave and indulge them&s;elves in mirth and plea&s;antry upon an occa&s;ion which the re&s;t of the human race contemplate with horror and anxiety.</P>
<P>SUCH is a faint and imperfect picture of the mi&s;eries; which the &s;lave trade inflicts upon the defencele&s;s natives of
<PB N="16" REF="023816_0016_0FC13806F01616D0">
Africa&mdash;Such is the melancholy condition to which they are reduced by tho&s;e who exult in the ble&s;&s;ings of civil government, and who boa&s;t the exerci&s;e of the virtues ofju&s;tice and humanity. The&s;e &s;ufferings and cruelties are experienced by them not to &s;upply their oppre&s;&s;ors with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, but &s;olely to furni&s;h them with the elegant conveniences, and &s;uperfluous luxuries of &s;en&s;uality. The product of their labour becomes a prin|cipal article of merchandize; and the nations of the earth derive their mo&s;t luxurious enjoyments from the unre|warded indu&s;try, and unparrallelled di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Afri|can &s;laves. What mu&s;t be our feelings when we con&s;ider, while we are regaling our &s;en&s;es and pampering our ap|petites upon the rich delicacies and varied luxuries of the Indian I&s;les, that their cultivation and growth have been ac|companied by the &s;ighs, the tears, and the groans of thou|&s;ands ofour fellow creatures.</P>
<P>To ju&s;tify this wanton violation of the rights of humani|ty, the tyrants' plea of nece&s;&s;ity is advanced. It is &s;aid that in no other way can the cultivation and improve|ment of the mo&s;t fertile countries be accompli&s;hed. It is painful to remark that this nece&s;&s;ity has ari&s;en from ex|treme cruelty&mdash;that the mode of treatment which the Af|ricans have experienced, has rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to de|populate Africa of thou&s;ands of the inhabitants annually, in order to &s;upply the number that are de&s;troyed in Amer|ica. Had they been treated with mildne&s;s and clemency, and protected in the enjoyment of liberty by ju&s;t and equal laws, without doubt their population would have furni&s;hed a &s;ufficient number of hardy and vigorous la|bourers to cultivate the ground in the mo&s;t profitable man|ner. It is a univer&s;al ob&s;ervation applicable to nations and individuals, that the value of the labor of their &s;laves increa&s;es in proportion to the kindne&s;s and humanity with which they are treated. A mo&s;t powerful induce|ment to check the progre&s;s of cruelty, and e&s;tabli&s;h a mild and generous rule of government. But &s;hort-&s;ighted ava|rice has overlooked &s;uch important advantages becau&s;e they appeared remote, and has prefered the immediate acqui&s;ition of property to the welfare and happine&s;s of the human race. It is a mortifying truth that the Engli&s;h in their We&s;t-India i&s;lands have exceeded any other na|tion in the cruel treatment of their &s;laves. It is a&s;toni&s;h|ing that a people who know the ble&s;&s;ings of a government
<PB N="17" REF="023816_0017_0FC1380DE68534C0">
which remained unrivalled till the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the con&s;titution of the United States, &s;hould be guilty of cru|elties &s;o repugnant to the &s;pirit and principles of their government. This circum&s;tance will call to remem|brance many events in the late war that gave birth to the American Empire. The unparrallelled cruelties exerci&s;|ed towards the pri&s;oners of war, by which many of our brethren &s;uffered all the tortures of cold, hunger, and death, will be an eternal &s;tigma on their national charac|ter; and the names of Howe and Clinton will be as infa|mous to future times as the names of Nero and Domitian.</P>
<P>HAVING contemplated the progre&s;s and extent of &s;lave|ry in different ages and countries, we may with plea&s;ure turn our attention from &s;uch dreary objects to the con&s;id|eration of it in our own country. Here a very different &s;cene will be exhibited. In the &s;ettlement of this State, our ance&s;tors were animated by the principles of ju&s;tice and benevolence. They obtained their title to the territo|ry by fair purcha&s;e, and not by conque&s;t&mdash;They never &s;hed the blood of the natives but in &s;elf defence&mdash;They never attempted to reduce them to a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, or deprive them of their freedom; but they took them under their generous protection, and endeavoured to be&s;tow up|on them the ble&s;&s;ings of a mild government and a pure religion. Though the importation of African &s;laves was permitted, yet it was never authori&s;ed by law&mdash;They were under the protection of government, and their treat|ment was always di&s;tingui&s;hed by that mildne&s;s and clem|ency which accorded with the characters of their ma&s;ters. If there can be any compen&s;ation for the want of liberty, there can be no doubt but that their &s;ituation was made preferable to what it had been in their own country&mdash;And mo&s;t clearly much greater profits have been derived from their &s;ervices under this mild u&s;age, than in tho&s;e coun|tries where they met with contrary treatment.</P>
<P>THE Legi&s;lature has lately interpo&s;ed in this State, and has enacted a &s;tatute founded in tne highe&s;t wi&s;dom and the be&s;t policy, which in its operation will not only even|tually produce the abolition of &s;lavery, but will &s;ecure to the Africans in this country the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing of lib|erty, again&s;t every &s;pecies of encroachment and violation. Our own citizens are prohibited from embarking in this
<PB N="18" REF="023816_0018_0FC13818B6E417F0">
iniquitous traffic. No &s;laves may be imported by any per&s;ons whatever, and heavy penalties and denounced again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;end any Africans who have been eman|cipated from &s;lavery, from this &s;tate to any other country. While we ju&s;tly be&s;tow &s;uch encomiums upon the laws and manners of our country, our regard to truth compels us with reluctance to ob&s;erve that there are &s;ome individu|als &s;o de&s;titute of humanity, that they have &s;tained the honour, and violated the laws of their country, by embark|ing in this infamous commerce. In a very few initances, per&s;ons have tran&s;ported &s;ome emancipated Africans to the We&s;t-Indies or &s;outhern &s;tates, and &s;old them for &s;laves. An African who has thus been twice deprived of his lib|erty, &s;eems to excite a double &s;hare of compa&s;&s;ion. The villain who is capable of &s;uch ba&s;ene&s;s and cruelty, mu&s;t be hardened in the ways of iniquity and regardle&s;s of the principles of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>BUT we have &s;ome con&s;olation for the few in&s;tances of this kind which have happened, from the circum&s;tance that they have given birth to the in&s;titution of a &s;ociety which will prevent their repetition. Animated with the pure&s;t &s;entiments of benevolence, and anxious to &s;often the woes of human life, the &s;ociety which I have the honor to addre&s;s was e&s;tabli&s;hed for the noble purpo&s;e not only of combining its exertions with other &s;ocieties of a &s;imilar nature, to procure the general abolition of &s;lavery, but al&s;o to furni&s;h relief to per&s;ons unju&s;tly held in bondage, and incapable of claiming the protection of the law.</P>
<P>THE contemplation of &s;uch &s;ublime principles mu&s;t ex|pand every heart with the warme&s;t rapture and pure&s;t de|light. Humanity is exalted to it's highe&s;t exerci&s;e when it feels for the whole human race and prompts to actions which have for their object the glory and felicity of future ages. It is a plea&s;ing con&s;ideration that the liberal &s;enti|ment &s;o prevalent at this period is invigorated and diffu&s;|ed by the mild &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity. That religion which has produced &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing difference of character between ancient and modern times, and has &s;o greatly bettered the condition of mankind by aboli&s;hing dome&s;tic &s;lavery in Europe, &s;till continues to extend the operati|on of principles that are highly favourable to human hap|pine&s;s. It is a truth which ought not to be omitted, that the amba&s;&s;adors of this holy religion, animated by the
<PB N="19" REF="023816_0019_0FC1381A64B212D0">
genuine &s;pirit of the heavenly doctrines which they teach, and filled with a becoming zeal to promote the immortal welfare of their fellow-creatures, have taken an active and decided part in favour of the defencele&s;s tribes of Africaf. What benefits may not civil &s;ociety expert from the gen|erous exertions of a cla&s;s of men who labour to re&s;tore mankind to their natural rights in this world, in order to prepare them for eternal felicity in the world to come.</P>
<P>HAVING taken a conci&s;e view of the origin, the pro|gre&s;s and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;lavery, we are to con&s;ider what mea&s;ures can be &s;ugge&s;ted, adopted, and executed to accompli&s;h the important purpo&s;e of its abolition. In our own State a punctual ob&s;ervance of the laws in being will eventually an&s;wer the de&s;ign. As there are &s;ome per&s;ons in all countries &s;o de&s;titute of the principles of virtue that they will practice every expedient to elude and contravene the laws, it may be nece&s;&s;ary not only to attend to the punctual execution of them, but al&s;o to intere&s;t the pub|lic opinion again&s;t &s;uch nefarious conduct. To de&s;ignate the per&s;ons who pur&s;ue this commerce, and brand them with &s;ome public mark of infamy, may reach offenders in certain ca&s;es which are beyond the animad ver&s;ion of law&mdash;and there are but few &s;o hardened as to brave that univer&s;al reproach and contempt which in a &s;hort time the general voice of mankind will denounce again&s;t tho&s;e who engage in this iniquitous branch of bu&s;ine&s;s. The principles that con&s;titute the ba&s;is of the government of the United States will infallibly produce an extinction of &s;la|very throughout the empire, as &s;oon as will be compati|ble with the &s;afety of the public and the welfare of the &s;laves them&s;laves. And I am fully convinced that the pe|riod is not remote when the whole world will a&s;&s;ent to the truth of the proportion, that in every &s;pecies of manufac|ture, and in every mode of cultivating the earth, the labor of freemen will be far more profitable than the labour of &s;laves.</P>
<P>BUT every bo&s;om glows with a de&s;ire to furni&s;h a relief commen&s;urate to the injury. All wi&s;h that &s;ome plan might be adopted to procure the univer&s;al e&s;tabli&s;hment of liberty for this people&mdash;How can &s;o de&s;ireable a purpo&s;e be accompli&s;hed? Shall we apply to the &s;upreme power of the empire, and reque&s;t their interpo&s;ition witn foreign nations in favour of this people that liave &s;o long been
<PB N="20" REF="023816_0020_0FC1381BF03E72D8">
the object of contempt and indifference. Vain would be &s;uch an interpo&s;ition on the part of our government&mdash;The kings and princes of the earth who have &s;o long &s;lumber|ed on their thrones in idlene&s;s and luxury, will be deaf to every mea&s;ure that is calculated to augment the happine&s;s of mankind by the exten&s;ion of liberty. No mea&s;ure can be attended with &s;ucce&s;s unle&s;s it be directed to a univer|&s;al di&s;&s;emination of the principles of liberty and inde|pendence, and to animate and rou&s;e all mankind to a general exertion in reclaiming their natural rights and privileges.</P>
<P>IT is a&s;toni&s;hing that rational beings have &s;o long &s;ub|mitted to governments which are &s;o far from being cal|culated to promote the general good, that they are de|&s;tructive to the happine&s;s of the &s;ubjects, and involve them in greater trouble and confu&s;ion than would be experi|enced in a &s;tate of nature. The more information the people obtain, and the more they reflect on their degrada|tion and their &s;ervile obedience to a few who &s;port with their wretchedne&s;s and ruin, the &s;tronger will be their induce|ment to &s;truggle for a re&s;toration of their natural rights, and the enjoyment of the &s;ecurity of a well regulated gov|ernment. Let us &s;ee whether mankind are not ha&s;tening to accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e. For a long time the ea&s;tern world has experienced no capital revolution&mdash;Knowledge has been &s;preading on all &s;ides and preparing the minds of men for &s;ome great event. The pre&s;ent kingdoms of Eu|rope were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire. The unwieldy de&s;poti&s;m of that exten&s;ive government &s;eems to have thrown a langour on the human mind, to have en&s;eebled the vigor of genius and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the power of imagination. The conquerors, ignorant of the arts of peace, e&s;tabli&s;hed their governments upon the &s;ame military principles which led them from the cold regions of the North to the delicious climes of the South. When men are united in &s;ociety and protected by government, the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence is, a gradual progre&s;&s;ion in the civilization of manners and the improvements of literature. Such has been the progre&s;s in Europe; and that country has exhibited a mo&s;t &s;triking contra&s;t between the man|ners, the cu&s;toms, and the literature of the dark ages, and the eighteenth century. Printing has furni&s;hed every na|tion with &s;o many monuments of literary excellence, that it has become impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould revert to that
<PB N="21" REF="023816_0021_0FC1381D6FEE85E8">
&s;tate of ignorance and barbari&s;m which followed the &s;ub|ver&s;ion of the imperial power of Rome. The progre&s;s of learning has expanded the fire of genius, enlarged the com|prehen&s;ion of the mind, and unfolded a very different i|dea of the rights of man from that which was entertained at the formation of the pre&s;ent governments of Europe. In this progre&s;s religion has been refined and purified from the dro&s;s of Pagan idolatry, and the ab&s;urdities of enthu&s;ia&s;tic ignorance. No more do we &s;ee the flames of per&s;ecution blazing through Europe, nor hear the groans of wretched victims re&s;ounding thro the horrid dungeons of the inqui&s;ition. The world has at length di&s;covered this &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition, that faith in matters of reli|gion is incapable of legal coercion&mdash;that uniformity of o|pinion can never be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that variety is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the happine&s;s of the people and the &s;ta|bility of government. A difference of opinion in point of &s;peculation has cea&s;ed to be criminal, and the &s;acred right of private judgment is univer&s;ally acknowledged. No more do the deepening glooms of &s;uper&s;tition &s;pread a torpor over the intellectual faculties, and deaden the &s;prings of active life&mdash;No more do the flights of enthu&s;i|a&s;m prompt to the wild deeds of faction, and the incohe|rent ravings of mi&s;taken devotion&mdash;No more does hypoc|ri&s;y a&s;&s;ume the ma&s;k of piety and the garb of innocence, for the purpo&s;e of impo&s;ing upon the &s;implicity and the credulity of the ignorant&mdash;No longer is the merit of man e&s;timated by high preten&s;ions of &s;anctity and extreme au&s;terity of manners. But while &s;uper&s;tition, enthu&s;ia&s;m, and hypoc|ri&s;y are retiring to the regions of primeval darkne&s;s, be|hold the mild beams of liberality, candour, and charity, are unfolding upon us in a blaze of glory, and commenc|ing their univer&s;al and eternal reign, The &s;tandard of merit is founded upon vigor of under&s;tanding&mdash;extent of information&mdash;and purity of character. While the&s;e &s;entiments are prevailing, it is nece&s;&s;ary that an alteration &s;hould take place in government corre&s;pondent to the im|provements of mankind.</P>
<P>BEHOLD that &s;pirit of liberty which led the Americans to empire and fame, and laid the foundation of a govern|ment which will be the glory of the pre&s;ent, and the admi|tion of future ages has cro&s;&s;ed the atlantic and flies like the electric flame from brea&s;t to brea&s;t, and kingdom to kingdom. An important revolution is commencing&mdash;a new order of things is begun. In the kingdom of France
<PB N="22" REF="023816_0022_0FC1382126FAE5A8">
we have witne&s;&s;ed a change in government without a parallel in hi&s;tory. The people in&s;pired by the cool voice of rea&s;on, have by a deliberate act re&s;umed their natural rights, and have the faire&s;t pro&s;pect to e&s;tabli&s;h a con&s;titu|tion of government upon the broad ba&s;is of general liber|ty, which will &s;ecure to them the enjoyment of peace and pro&s;perity. The lives and property of the citizens are no more dependent on the will of the &s;overeign, and his man|dates are no longer the laws of the land. The Ba&s;tile that dete&s;table in&s;trument of tyrrany, that public infu&s;e upon human nature, where &s;o many per&s;ons have langui&s;h|ed away a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence in the gloomy man&s;ions of a dungeon, is levelled with the du&s;t. What heart is not animated to behold the &s;ame French Nation who had long trembled at the &s;ound of the name of the Ba&s;tile, now in|&s;pired by the flame of liberty, marching with the firmne&s;s and intrepidity of heroes to the attack of de&s;poti&s;m in the center of her capital. Hi&s;tory has never exhibited a more glorious triumph of liberty over arbitrary power.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame &s;pirit pervades the various kingdoms of Eu|rope. From the &s;hores of the atlantic to the confines of A&s;ia, the minds of men are in&s;pired with that &s;park of li|berty which was kindled by nature, and the flame of op|po&s;ition is ready to bur&s;t on their unfeeling oppre&s;&s;ors. The &s;overeigns of Europe behold from their tottering thrones, the&s;e alarming pro&s;pects with the deepe&s;t fear and concern. Even the Ottoman De&s;pot, who from a capital calculated by nature to be the Emporium of commerce, and the mi&s;tre&s;s of the world, has long di&s;tributed mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s, thro his exten&s;ive dominions, now views with horror and amazement, the &s;pirit of freedom reviving among his &s;ubjects&mdash;Perhaps that fame may be rekindled, which produced &s;uch wonders in the flouri&s;hing period of the Grecian republics.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to predict what will be the event of this pro&s;pect, that is unfolding to our view&mdash;But we may with|out the &s;pirit of prophecy, venture to a&s;&s;ert that the world is on the eve of a great revolution&mdash;that if the forms of government are not materially altered, yet the &s;pirit of them will be retined and &s;ublimated, and conformed to the intere&s;t and welfare of the human race&mdash;That &s;overeigns will no longer dare to &s;port with the feelings, and trifle with the happine&s;s of their &s;ubjects&mdash;That they will find

their own pre&s;ervation and &s;ecurity dependent upon an im|partial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice&mdash;The &s;tate of the human mind mo&s;t unque&s;tionably renders nece&s;&s;ary &s;uch a revolu|tion, and we may anticipate the accompli&s;hment of it, with exultation and delight.</P>
<P>THE illu&s;trious head of the American Empire may contemplate with ineffable rapture, the exten&s;ive ble&s;&s;ings flowing to all mankind, from a revolution in which he bore a principal &s;hare&mdash;Elevated to the &s;upreme magi&s;tracy, by the unanimous voice of millions, as a reward for his faith|ful &s;ervices, and &s;upported by the applau&s;e and approba|tion of a grateful and pro&s;perous nation, he &s;urveys with con&s;cious &s;uperiority the hereditary monarchs of Europe, trembling on their thrones of de&s;poti&s;m, and &s;u&s;taining their authority by force, and fear amid the tears, the groans, and the execrations of their wretched &s;ubjects and va&s;&s;als.</P>
<P>OUR plea&s;ure in beholding this glorious pro&s;pect opening upon mankind, is heightened by the con&s;ideration, that the fable tribes of Africa will participate of the common ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;That &s;pirit of enquiry, and that liberality of &s;entiment which are prompting mankind to a general &s;truggle for liberty and happine&s;s, will comprehend for their object, every nation on the globe.&mdash;Within a few years pa&s;t, no &s;ubject has more warmly engaged the attention of the lite|rary world, than African &s;lavery&mdash;and the writings of the divine, the philosopher, the poet, and the noveli&s;t concur in reprobating the practice in terms of equal &s;everity&mdash;The rapid and exten&s;ive diffu&s;ion of the&s;e generous &s;entiments, will in a &s;hort time produce the total extirpation of a &s;lavery which has exhibited the mo&s;t complicated &s;y&s;tem of ba&s;ene&s;s and cruelty, that ever in&s;ulted the dignity of human nature. Let us combine our exertions in accelerat|ing the accompli&s;hment of this happy event&mdash;while our hearts are elevated at the plea&s;ing &s;cene, let us addre&s;s the FATHER of MERCIES with this humble &s;upplication&mdash;that all people may be re&s;tored to the &s;afe and peaceable enjoyment of their natural rights and privileges&mdash;that do|me&s;tic and national &s;lavery may be aboli&s;hed thro the the world&mdash;and that civil government may be every where e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the broad and permanent ba&s;is of political liberty, and the general good, and flouri&s;h till time &s;hall be no more.</P>
