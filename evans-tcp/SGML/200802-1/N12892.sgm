<Q><BIBL>ROMANS I. XVI.</BIBL>
<P>&mdash;I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the beginning of this chapter St. Paul declares, that he was divinely called to be an apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t, and &s;eparated to the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try; and in the ver&s;e preceed|ing the text, that he was ready and de&s;irous to preach the go&s;pel at Rome. This being the ca|pital of the roman empire, the apo&s;tle knew that he &s;hould there probably meet with men of great learning and &s;ubtlety, as well as of great power and riches, who would critically examine his doc|trine, and from their attachment to their old religion and &s;uper&s;tition, which chri&s;tianity was de&s;igned to overthrow, do all they could to expo&s;e him and his preaching to contempt and ridicule.
<PB N="6" REF="016306_0004_0F9C1F31132E89A8">
But con&s;cious of the goodne&s;s of his cau&s;e, of the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the chri&s;tian in&s;titution, and that it would bear the &s;tricte&s;t examination, he declares, as in the text, that he was not a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; not a&s;hamed to appear a di&s;ciple and an apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t crucified, and to publi&s;h his religion before the greate&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men of that famous city. The words, "I am not a&s;hamed" are figurative, and intend more than they expre&s;s: The apo&s;tle meant to a&s;|&s;ert not only that he was not a&s;hamed of, but that he gloried in the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and tho't it &s;o far from being a di&s;grace, that it was a real honor to be a friend and a preacher of this religion. Such was the language of the great apo&s;tle; and his conduct was along agreea|ble to it. After he embraced chri&s;tianity, he was ever a &s;teady firm friend to it, openly, and boldly e&s;pou&s;ing its cau&s;e, and doing all in his power to maintain and promote it. There were however &s;ome in his day, who were a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel; and &s;uch there have been in every age &s;ince: Some &s;uch there probably are among us in this day of thoughtle&s;s di&s;&s;ipation and infidelity: Per&s;ons who from their mi&s;taken notions of the go&s;pel, and of true honor are a&s;hamed to profe&s;s and practi&s;e chri&s;tianity. In order therefore to do what I can to promote the cau&s;e of my Divine ma&s;ter, who hath honoured me, putting me into the mini&s;try, and prevent &s;o fatal a perver&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;ion of &s;hame among my beloved hearers, who&s;e honor and happine&s;s, I am &s;o highly obliged to &s;erve; I propo&s;e, in di&s;cour&s;ing upon this &s;ubject,</P>

<P N="1">I. I am to con&s;ider what it is to be a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is not nece&s;&s;ary to give a preci&s;e definition of the pa&s;&s;ion of &s;hame, which none are wholly &s;trangers to. Every man has probably felt in him|&s;elf, or &s;een in others &s;omething of the effects of it. In &s;trictne&s;s of &s;peech it re&s;pects only, pa&s;t or pre&s;ent actions or things; but in a lax or popular &s;en&s;e it may be con&s;idered, as looking forward to things future; accordingly in common language we attribute men's doing or omitting certain acti|ons to this principle: Thus we &s;ay a man is a&s;ham|ed to do &s;uch an action, or to neglect &s;uch an one; i. e. he knows that &s;uch a conduct would expo&s;e him to &s;hame, and for fear of that unea&s;y pa&s;&s;ion he avoids it. Shame ari&s;es wholy from a defer|ence to the opinions of others, and not at all from a regard to propriety and right conduct: And therefore it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that it is not &s;it to be a governing principle, for it can lead to no &s;teady conduct, but only to a conformity to the opinions and practices of tho&s;e with whom we hap|pen to live, and by whom we wi&s;h to be e&s;teemed. And yet it is not an u&s;ele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion. It was im|planted within us, as all our pa&s;&s;ions were, for
<PB N="8" REF="016306_0006_0F9C1F37CBF4F190">
wi&s;e and good ends, and often an&s;wers valuable purpo&s;es. Men who have no fear of God be|fore their eyes, may be re&s;trained from ba&s;e and vicious actions by fear of the reproach and con|tempt of others. And it is no ways improper to maintain a degree of deference to the opinion of other per&s;ons and a regard to their approbati|on and e&s;teem. In the prophecy of Jeremiah, it is mentioned as a mark of the great degeneracy of certain profligate per&s;ons, that when they com|mitted abomination they were not at all a&s;hamed, neither could they blu&s;h: Therefore, &s;aith the Lord, they &s;hall fall among them that fall, at the time that I vi&s;it them, they &s;hall be ca&s;t down. But tho' it is a mark of a ba&s;e and degenerate mind to be incapable of &s;hame; yet it is certain that this pa&s;&s;ion &s;ometimes leads men greatly a&s;ide from their duty, and puts them upon violating the laws of God, to avoid reproach and cen&s;ure from men: From wrong notions of true honor, per&s;ons are &s;ometimes a&s;hamed to be &s;ingular even in a good cau&s;e, and dare not act differently from tho&s;e who&s;e company they keep, le&s;t they &s;hould incur their ill opinion. And thus for fear of lo&s;ing the e&s;teem and approbation of men, they expo&s;e them&s;elves to the reproaches of their own hearts, and the condemnation of God.</P>
<P>FOR the further illu&s;tration of this matter, let it be ob&s;erved; That if any man for fear of be|ing in di&s;grace with tho&s;e who&s;e company he keeps, or of incurring any cen&s;ure or reproach from men, gives up and renounces chri&s;tianity,
<PB N="9" REF="016306_0007_0F9C1F390E53D0F0">
and, to recommend him&s;elf to his vicious com|panions, endeavors to turn it into ridicule and banter; or, not wholly renouncing it&punc; neglects to take due care to acquaint him&s;elf with the doc|trines and precepts of it, by &s;tudying the holy &s;criptures, where only they are to be found in their purity, becau&s;e it is not e&s;teemed genteel to read the bible; or from a like motive neglects to perform tho&s;e public and private acts of piety and devotion which the go&s;pel requires; or di&s;|regards the po&s;itive in&s;titutions of the go&s;pel, bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper; or is &s;hy of ap|pearing to be a &s;erious con&s;cientious per&s;on; or renounces any doctrine plainly contained in &s;crip|ture:&mdash;If any man, I &s;ay, acts thus from &s;uch motives, he is a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t: He violates his duty to gain the approbation of the world, and &s;hews that he loves the prai&s;es of men more than the prai&s;es of God. Where|as on the other hand, he who has &s;uch a re|gard to his duty, and the approbation of his Maker, as openly to profe&s;s him&s;elf a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t in a licentious age, when infidelity is fa&s;hionable, and he knows that by this means he &s;hall expo&s;e him&s;elf to reproach; who practi&s;es daily the neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed duties of prayer to God, and pays due regard to the po&s;itive in|&s;titutions of religion, though he is ridiculed as a weak, &s;uper&s;titious bigot; who appears openly a friend and advocate for chri&s;tianity, and &s;tea|dily practi&s;es all the duties therein commanded, however di&s;reputable they may be thought by others, making it evident that his governing aim
<PB N="10" REF="016306_0008_0F9C1F3ACFD0C078">
is to &s;hew him&s;elf approved unto God, whatever the world may think or &s;ay of him:&mdash;He, I &s;ay, who does thus, proves that he is not a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. I go on,</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;hew that the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity have rea&s;on to glory in, rather than to be a&s;hamed of their religion.</P>
<P>For the confirmation of this point, &s;everal particulars may be con&s;idered di&s;tinctly. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. It may be proper to take a brief &s;ummary view of the doctrines of the go&s;pel, and &s;ee whether there be any thing ab&s;urd or unrea&s;on|able in them, any thing which a wi&s;e man need be a&s;hamed to believe: Now the&s;e doctrines are; That there is one, and only one God, eternal, &s;elf-exi&s;tent and immortal: That he is a pure Spirit, and con&s;equently invi&s;ible, without any bodily parts, &s;hape, form or pa&s;&s;ions: That he is unchangeably the <Q>&s;ame, ye&s;terday, to day and forever:</Q>&mdash;Every where pre&s;ent, <Q>filling all in all:</Q>&mdash;Infinite in knowledge and wi&s;dom, and of almighty power:&mdash;So &s;upreme and un|equaled in goodne&s;s, that, in the language of Chri&s;t, <Q>there is none good but one, that is God:</Q>&mdash;Of impartial ju&s;tice and everla&s;ting truth and faithfulne&s;s; glorious in holine&s;s, every way perfect, and incomprehen&s;ibly great.&mdash;That this great Being created the world and continu|ally pre&s;ides over it, pre&s;erving, directing and di&s;|po&s;ing of all things according to his good plea|&s;ure:&mdash;That his providence extends to the fowls
<PB N="11" REF="016306_0009_0F9C1F3B96BD0F68">
of the air, the lillies and gra&s;s of the field, the height of our &s;tature, and even to the number of the hairs of our head:&mdash;That there is nothing in the univer&s;e, great or &s;mall, vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible, animate or inanimate, which is not under his government and controul. Now is not this ac|count of the perfections and providence of God worthy of his maje&s;ty and greatne&s;s, and alto|gether agreeable to right rea&s;on? Are not the&s;e the very doctrines which are called the funda|mental principles of natural religion? Though it is certain that <HI>the world by wi&s;dom knew not God,</HI> i.e. did not di&s;cover him to be what he is, by mere rea&s;on; but are chiefly indebted to re|velation, for the knowledge which they have of him: But the&s;e doctrines being di&s;covered, they approve them&s;elves to the unbia&s;ed rea&s;on of mankind; nor can any of them be denied with|out running into manife&s;t ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>The&s;e which have been mentioned are not what are commonly called doctrines of the go&s;|pel; but are the foundation upon which the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem is built: And the&s;e being adopted and inculcated by Chri&s;t affords a pre&s;umptive evidence that the &s;uper&s;tructure which he rai&s;ed upon them is equally rea&s;onable and worthy of God. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that Je&s;us would have given &s;o ju&s;t and compleat a repre&s;entation of the divine perfections, if the religion he was in&s;tituting was in any re&s;pect incon&s;i&s;tent with any of the&s;e perfections. The doctrines of the go&s;pel which are peculiar to the chri&s;tian in&s;titu|tion
<PB N="12" REF="016306_0010_0F9C1F3C4BE9D5D0">
are tho&s;e which relate particularly to the redemption of the world by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. They re&s;pect mankind not con&s;idered as innocent, but as apo&s;tate, guilty creatures, exceedingly prone to tran&s;gre&s;s, and for their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions liable to the cur&s;e of God. And that mankind really are in &s;uch a &s;tate, has been owned and lamented by the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of the heathen morali&s;ts.</P>
<P>Mankind, then, being in a degenerate &s;tate, &s;unk into ignorance, idolatry and vice, the go&s;pel teaches us, that God from his immen&s;e goodne&s;s and mercy &s;ent his only begotten and well be|loved Son into the world, that by his example, in&s;truction and &s;uffering he might lead them to the knowledge of the true God, and the practi&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and make &s;uch atonement for their &s;ins as the wi&s;dom of God &s;aw nece&s;&s;ary to render their pardon and eternal &s;alvation con|&s;i&s;tent with the honor and dignity of his laws and government:&mdash;That this glorious per&s;on, after fini&s;hing his work on earth, and becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the cro&s;s, was rewarded by God with the highe&s;t glory and honor, having a name given him above every name; angels, principalities and powers being made &s;ubject unto him:&mdash;That as by him God made the worlds, &s;o by him he now carries on the admini&s;tration of his providence and grace; and that by the &s;ame illu&s;trious per&s;on he will at the la&s;t day, rai&s;e the dead, and judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, having given us a&s;&s;urance that he hath ordained him for that purpo&s;e. Such in general is the doctrine of the go&s;pel concern|ing
<PB N="13" REF="016306_0011_0F9C1F3D1570E440">
the Mediator; a doctrine which, I am &s;en&s;i|ble, has been often objected again&s;t; tho' I know of no objection but what has been fully an&s;wered. It is beyond my de&s;ign at pre&s;ent to con&s;ider this controver&s;y. I will only ob&s;erve, that the mediatorial &s;cheme, as repre&s;ented in the go&s;pel, appears to me to bear a general ana|logy to the common method of the divine con|duct. God, we know, is to be con&s;idered as the giver of every good thing: But it is evident that he generally makes u&s;e of the in&s;trumentality of his creatures for the communication of his favors; He re&s;tores health to the &s;ick by means of his phy&s;ician; He feeds the poor by the liberality of the rich; He in&s;tructs the ignorant by means of the learned; and makes us the daily mini&s;ters of good to one another: His purpo&s;es re&s;pecting nations and kingdoms are commonly executed by the agency of men. Why then &s;hould it be thought incredible that God &s;hould carry on his general government by the mediation of his Son? As to the doctrine of atonement by the death of Chri&s;t;&mdash;I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that mankind in all ages &s;eem to have thought that &s;omething of this &s;ort was nece&s;&s;ary in order to the pardon of &s;inners, though they &s;hould repent; as appears from their u&s;e of various propitiatory &s;acrifices: &mdash;That the goodne&s;s of God is illu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;|played in his providing a &s;acrifice, and receiving offenders to favor upon any terms; and his ju&s;tice in requiring an expiation:&mdash;That no in+jury is done to Chri&s;t, &s;ince he <HI>voluntarily</HI> gave him&s;elf for us, an offering and a &s;acrifice to God; &mdash;and, in a word, that Almighty God having

cho&s;en in this way to &s;hew mercy to his guilty creatures, it would be highly ab&s;urd and impious in us to find fault with the &s;cheme, even &s;up|po&s;ing our imperfect under&s;tandings could di&s;|cover no wi&s;dom in it: It would certainly be more rea&s;onable and honorable for us, to &s;ub|mit to the appointment of God and thankfully receive his favor in the way which he cho&s;e to communicate it, than arrogantly to arraign his conduct, as if we were wi&s;er than he:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>Methinks tho&s;e long-headed gentlemen, the Dei&s;ts, before they go to work to pull the chri&s;tian religion to pieces on account of &s;ome particulars in it, which they tell us they cannot comprehend, or reconcile to their notions, &s;hould in the fir&s;t place &s;hew us that they can comprehend all the my&s;teries in nature, and reconcile them to their notions. Before they tell us that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the notion of infinite goodne&s;s to &s;uppo&s;e, that God &s;hould choo&s;e to for|give his offending creatures through an expiation and inter|ce&s;&s;ion, rather than without them, they &s;hould &s;hew us how it is con&s;i&s;tent with the notion of infinite goodne&s;s, that one half of the animal creation &s;hould be made to devour the other, and that &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful and harmle&s;s of God's creatures &s;hould be expo&s;ed to continual fear through their whole lives, and at la&s;t to a cruel death for the &s;ake of &s;upporting &s;ome other &s;pecies of creatures, which to us &s;eem to be the very blot of the creation, and the burden of the earth Before they begin to di&s;pute the truth of the incarnation becau&s;e they cannot comprehend how One, who was before the creation, &s;hould take upon him an human body, they ought fir&s;t to &s;hew us that they under&s;tand exactly how a human or any other &s;pirit is fir&s;t placed in the body it animates, and wherein the ab&s;urdity lies of &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;pirit capable of being placed in a body created a thou&s;and years after it began to exi&s;t, more than in &s;uppo&s;ing that a &s;pirit may animate a body created an hour after it, or before it, or at the &s;ame time with it.

whole then, there does not appear to be any thing in the &s;cripture doctrine of a mediator which a wi&s;e man need be a&s;hamed to believe.</P>
<P>Let us next,</P>
<P N="2">2. Take a brief view of the precepts of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>They direct us to love, fear and honor God as the fir&s;t and the greate&s;t, the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of Beings: chearfully to &s;ubmit to all the ap|pointments of his providence, knowing that he is perfect in wi&s;dom&punc; goodne&s;s and power; to fol|low his example as dear children, endeavouring to be perfect as he is perfect; to wor&s;hip him who is a &s;pirit, in &s;pirit and in truth, with up|right, humble and contrite minds devoted to his &s;ervice; acknowledging our continual depen|dence upon him for life and breath and all things, confe&s;&s;ing our &s;ins before him, praying to him for pardon, for pre&s;ervation from every evil, and the be&s;towment of every thing truly good for us, glorifying his tran&s;cendently amiable perfections, and thanking him for his abundant goodne&s;s: Nor are we to regard our&s;elves only in the&s;e ad|dre&s;&s;es&punc; but to make our prayer, interce&s;&s;ion and thank&s;giving for all men. And the&s;e addre&s;&s;es are to be pre&s;ented to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the only mediator between God and man, and through whom alone we have acce&s;s to the Father. But we are not thus to wor&s;hip God becau&s;e he needs to be informed of our wants, or loves to be flattered and complimented with the mention of his perfections and our declara|tions
<PB N="16" REF="016306_0014_0F9C1F3F4C5FD0F0">
of gratitude; or as if he could be impor|tuned to alter the wi&s;e method of his conduct; but to bring our own minds to &s;uch a temper as to render us fit objects of his favor, and di&s;po&s;e us to a &s;uitable behavior towards him, and our fellow creatures.</P>
<P>Now will any man, who has a proper concep|tion of the glorious perfections of God, and of our relation and obligations to him, deny this to be a rea&s;onable &s;ervice, which it is fooli&s;h and &s;hameful to neglect, and wi&s;e and honorable to perform?</P>
<P>As to our neighbours;&mdash;we are commanded to love them as our&s;elves; to do to others as we would have them do to us; to be &s;incere, ju&s;t and charitable in all our dealings with men; and do all we can to promote their good; to live peaceably with all men if po&s;&s;ible; to do no injury; and if a brother be offended, immedi|ately endeavour to be reconciled to him; to bear injuries with meekne&s;s, and forgive offenders, as we hope that God, through Chri&s;t, will have mercy upon us; not to render evil for evil, but endeavor to overcome evil with good.&mdash;This is an epitome of our duty to our neighbour, as laid down in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>As to &s;elf-government:&mdash;We are directed to keep our&s;elves pure; and taught, that the things which defile a man are evil thoughts indulged and breaking out into evil actions; and are therefore commanded not to indulge malice,
<PB N="17" REF="016306_0015_0F9C1F400CDEEC00">
revenge, envy, lu&s;t, covetou&s;ne&s;s, di&s;content, or any &s;uch evil pa&s;&s;ions; to &s;et our affections on things above and &s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of God and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, with humble contented minds, tru&s;ting in the providence of God for all temporal good things; to be &s;ober, temperate and cha&s;te, and regulate both our thoughts and de&s;igns, and all our external behaviour by the laws of religion and virtue.&mdash;Such in general is our duty to our&s;elves. And are not the&s;e precepts all wi&s;e and excellent? Is any thing here recom|mended, which right rea&s;on condemns; any thing forbidden, which &s;he approves? Will any rational man a&s;&s;ert that it is &s;hameful to practi&s;e, or hono|rable to violate any of the&s;e laws?</P>
<P>WHAT have been mentioned are the moral duties of chri&s;tianity, which are confe&s;&s;edly the weightier matters of the law. But be&s;ides the&s;e, the go&s;pel enjoins two po&s;itive in&s;titutions&mdash;Bap|ti&s;m and the Lord's-Supper; the one a rite of initia|tion into the church or &s;ociety of chri&s;tians; the other a commemoration of the love of Chri&s;t, the founder of this religion, to mankind. And is there any thing unrea&s;onable in the&s;e rites? Is it not proper that per&s;ons &s;hould in a public, formal manner be initiated into the &s;ociety of chri&s;|tians; and, that after they are members, they &s;hould by &s;ome &s;ignificant rite di&s;tingui&s;hing them from other per&s;ons, commemorate the love and goodne&s;s of their <HI>founder?</HI> The conduct of mankind in reference to &s;ocieties of their own e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;hews that they e&s;teem this rea|&s;onable.

The&s;e &s;ocieties have their forms of admi&s;&s;ion, their badges of di&s;tinction, and &s;ome of them their fe&s;tivals in honor of their founders or patrons. And if the&s;e things are thought rea|&s;onable in &s;ocieties of human in&s;titution, why &s;hould they be thought otherwi&s;e in that in&s;titu|ted by Chri&s;t?

<P N="3">3dly. To take notice of the &s;anctions of the go&s;pel, or the motives which it offers to induce men to comply with its demands. The&s;e are; That upon our &s;incerely endeavouring to do this, God will &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;t us by his holy &s;pirit in the di&s;charge of our duty and forgive our tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions: That at the end of the world the dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed, and all mankind &s;tand before the judgement &s;eat of Chri&s;t, and every man be dealt with according to his prevailing character, whe|ther it has been good or bad; when the wicked &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, and the righteous into life eternal.</P>
<P>I would now appeal to any impartial man whether the religion of the go&s;pel be not mo&s;t wi&s;e and excellent? Does it not in all its parts approve it&s;elf to the unprejudiced rea&s;on of our minds? Is it not becoming the wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s of God as the father and friend of mankind,
<PB N="19" REF="016306_0017_0F9C1F41B319CD68">
to in&s;titute &s;uch a religion to recover his apo&s;tate, guilty creatures to the knowledge of his will, and the practice of righteou&s;ne&s;s? Mu&s;t it not highly conduce to the dignity, perfection, and happine&s;s of mankind? It gives a perfect and &s;atisfactory repre&s;entation of the perfections and providence of God; and a&s;&s;ures us of his readine&s;s to for|give &s;inners. It &s;ets before us the doctrine of a re&s;urrection and a future &s;tate, in the mo&s;t con|vincing manner, by giving us pledges and exam|ples of its truth. We are not left to build our faith in this article upon the fables and fictions of poets and the bewildred rea&s;onings of philo&s;o|phers. No virtue can be tho't of which it does not recommend; no vice can be named which it does not condemn. No other &s;y&s;tem of morali|ty can be found which has not &s;ome mixture of fal&s;e rules, or fal&s;e principles. In the go&s;pel alone, we have the doctrines and laws of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s free from fal&s;ehood, &s;uper&s;tition and weakne&s;s. And need any man be a&s;hamed to profe&s;s and practi&s;e &s;uch a religion? Can rea&s;on account it di&s;honorable to do &s;o? Surely no. The only thing that a profe&s;&s;or of chri&s;tianity can have rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of, is his not living according to his profe&s;&s;ion. If he would do thus, he would be the very character which wi&s;e men of all ages have e&s;teemed the mo&s;t worthy and excellent; the character, which, in the opinion of Plato, mu&s;t charm the beholders with the highe&s;t degree of love and admiration; which all virtuous beings mu&s;t re&s;pect, and God him&s;elf delight to honor.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="016306_0018_0F9C1F43717C0F70">THUS, I conceive, it appears from the imper|fect account that has been given of the chri&s;tian in&s;titution, that it is an honor, in&s;tead of a &s;hame to any man to profe&s;s and practi&s;e this religion.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be &s;aid, that it may be all a forge|ry and its preten&s;ions to a divine original fal&s;e; and in that ca&s;e it would be di&s;honorable to em|brace it. I reply; (1.) That, allowing that it is a matter of doubt, whether it be a revelation from God, it is an in&s;titution &s;o well calculated to en|lighten and reform mankind, and promote the peace and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, that it is certainly worthy of great e&s;teem and re&s;pect, and every benevolent man mu&s;t wi&s;h, that it might be at|tended to as a rule of life by all mankind. But, (2.) The &s;uperior, the unrivaled excellency of the in&s;titution, the &s;ublimity, the perfection and con&s;i&s;tency of its doctrines; the rea&s;onablene&s;s, the extent, and unmixed purity of its precepts are, in my apprehen&s;ion, &s;ufficient to prove its divine original, to an hone&s;t candid mind, with|out any external arguments.

weight, that no man need be a&s;hamed to own him&s;elf convinced by them. But the&s;e cannot be con&s;idered here.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. IT may be proper for confirming the point I am upon, briefly to take a di&s;tinct view of the character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the founder of the chri&s;tian religion. According to the repre|&s;entation given of him in the go&s;pel, He was the be&s;t, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t honorable character that ever appeared upon earth; the &s;on of God in &s;o peculiar a &s;en&s;e as to be called his only be|gotten &s;on; the brightne&s;s of his glory and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on, in whom dwelt the fullne&s;s of the Godhead bodily. Before his in|carnation he had a glory with the father, far &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing all the glory of this world: And when he was made fle&s;h and dwelt among us, the &s;pirit of God was given him without mea&s;ure: He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch degrees of wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s, as never appeared in any other per&s;on. He healed inveterate di&s;ea&s;es, calm|ed the raging and tempe&s;tuous &s;ea, and rai&s;ed the dead to life by only &s;peaking a word. He di&s;|cerned the &s;ecrets of the heart, foretold future events, and evidently proved that he was endow|ed with the omni&s;cient &s;pirit of God. In his moral conduct he excelled all the men that ever lived in the world, both for the purity of his life and the perfection of his virtues: Actuated by &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted a benevolence, that, thro' his whole life he never performed a &s;ingle action in which he con&s;ulted his own intere&s;t only: He continu|ally
<PB N="22" REF="016306_0020_0F9C1F454E168D58">
went about doing good, having no other employment than that of promoting the good of mankind, ever e&s;teeming it more ble&s;&s;ed to give, than to receive, to mini&s;ter to others, than to be mini&s;tred unto. He exerci&s;ed &s;uch meekne&s;s, pa|tience and forgivene&s;s as no other per&s;on ever di&s;co|vered. The prayer which he uttered in behalf of his enemies when he was hanging on the cro&s;s,&mdash; Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do&mdash;fitly expre&s;&s;es the temper which he con&s;tantly maintained. In all things he was intirely re&s;igned to the will of his Father; and his piety was uni|form, rational, undi&s;&s;embled and fervent. Nor did he upon any occa&s;ion, either in word or deed, manife&s;t any emotion of mind incon&s;i&s;tent with a perfect love of God and man. He had no fai|lings to ob&s;cure the lu&s;tre of his virtues; no &s;pot, no blemi&s;h to tarni&s;h the brightne&s;s of his exam|ple: He was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled and &s;epe|rate from &s;inners. Such a pitch of perfection proved him to be &s;omething more than man; and rendered him a fit per&s;on to be the me&s;&s;enger of God to an apo&s;tate world to conduct them thro' the paths of righteou&s;ne&s;s to eternal glory. And &s;uch he declared him&s;elf to be; and both his miracles the excellency of his doctrine, and the holine&s;s of his life confirmed his declaration. God al&s;o bore witne&s;s to him, by the te&s;timony of the Judge who condemned him to the cro&s;s, by the miracles which took place at, and &s;oon after his death, and by rai&s;ing him from the grave the third day after he had been crucified and &s;lain by wicked hands; exalting him to the highe&s;t &s;eat of honor and felicity, and putting all things

in &s;ubjection under him. If then Je&s;us Chri&s;t was originally &s;o glorious and augu&s;t a character; if he was a divine me&s;&s;enger to mankind; if he was honoured by divine te&s;timonials to his truth and innocence in his life, at his death and by his re&s;urrection and exaltation; if he was perfect in holine&s;s and virtue thro' this life, and is now in|ve&s;ted with &s;upreme power and dominion, over angels and men;&mdash;need any man be a&s;hamed to profe&s;s his religion? Can any name or title be more honorable, than that of a di&s;ciple to &s;uch a ma&s;ter?&mdash;Let us</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Con&s;ider the de&s;ign of the go&s;pel in&s;ti|tution. This was, not to procure for its founder and his friends worldly riches, power and gran|deur; not to exalt him into a temporal &s;overeign, and render mankind &s;ub&s;ervient to his intere&s;t and plea&s;ure; as was apparently the de&s;ign of the worldly-minded and politic Mahomet, in the in|&s;titution of his religion. No action in the life of Chri&s;t, no &s;entiment in the go&s;pel bears the mark of &s;uch an intention. Chri&s;tianity has a more di&s;intere&s;ted, benevolent and God-like aim. It's de&s;ign, in general, is to de&s;troy the works of the devil; i. e. &s;in, which has defaced the moral cre|ation of God, and the natural and penal evils brought upon mankind by it; to re&s;cue from a &s;tate of &s;lavery and mi&s;ery, not a &s;ingle nation, but the whole world, and re&s;tore them to liberty and happine&s;s; and for this purpo&s;e to reveal the mercy and loving kindne&s;s of God, bring life and immortality to light, and teach and per&s;uade men
<PB N="24" REF="016306_0022_0F9C1F46DC0E9248">
to deny ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;t, and live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the world, look|ing and hoping for eternal glory and happine&s;s in Heaven. And is not this an excellent de&s;ign? Can any purpo&s;e be more worthy of the kind parent of the univer&s;e, or de&s;erve a more cordial and thankful acceptance of man? Can any thing be more honorable for a rational creature than to fall in, and co-operate with &s;uch a de&s;ign?</P>
<P N="6">6thly. We &s;hall be further convinced that chri&s;tians have no cau&s;e to be a&s;hamed of their religion, if we con&s;ider the effects which it has had in the world. Though it is to be wi&s;hed that the&s;e had been greater; yet they have not been incon&s;iderable. Many enormities which anciently prevailed and were approved in the heathen world, are in a great mea&s;ure bani&s;hed from, or at lea&s;t rendered di&s;reputable in every country where chri&s;tianity is profe&s;&s;ed in tolerable purity; &s;uch as polygamy, ince&s;t, expo&s;ing in|fants, unnatural lu&s;t, &s;uicide, revenge, and the mo&s;t vile and &s;en&s;ele&s;s idolatry, which tended alike to deba&s;e the mind and corrupt the morals. Let any man read the hi&s;tories of the ancient monarchies of the world or the moral writings of ancient philo&s;ophers, and he will be convinced that mankind has been greatly reformed&punc; both in principles and practice by the chri&s;tian in&s;titution. Its good effects were indeed much more vi&s;ible, when it fir&s;t appeared in the world, than they have been in later ages. Then it wrought with &s;urpri&s;ing power and energy in reforming many
<PB N="25" REF="016306_0023_0F9C1F4796A6EB70">
who embraced it; and oftentimes from &s;ome of the wor&s;t, made them &s;ome of the be&s;t of men. But even in later times, its good influence is not &s;mall. It mu&s;t be owned, with grief and concern, that wickedne&s;s too much abounds in every chri&s;tian country&punc; But we have rea&s;on to believe that there are many good men among the bad; and more than there would have been, were it not for the go&s;pel: And however di&s;&s;olute the generality may be in any chri&s;tian country, they would without doubt be much wor&s;e, if they had never been favored with revelation. In a word, if you compare any country where the go&s;pel is enjoyed in its purity, with &s;ome of the ancient heathen countries, or even with &s;ome of modern times, you will be convinced that it is not an u&s;e|le&s;s but an highly beneficial in&s;titution: And while we have undeniable evidence that many men have been made better by embracing chri&s;|tianity, we may challenge all the records of infi|delity to produce a &s;ingle in&s;tance of any man's being made better by rejecting it. But,</P>
<P N="7">7. If we con&s;ider the character of &s;ome of tho&s;e who have believed and profe&s;&s;ed the go&s;pel, we &s;hall have further evidence that it is not &s;hameful, fooli&s;h or unrea&s;onable for us to do &s;o too.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who embraced chri&s;tianity in its early days, there were &s;ome men of di&s;tingui&s;hed learning and mental abilities. Not to mention the Apo&s;tle Paul him&s;elf, who was undoubtedly a man of &s;uperior rational powers, and acquainted
<PB N="26" REF="016306_0024_0F9C1F484C59D998">
with all the learning of his day; and who would, therefore, have been as likely as any man to have di&s;covered it, if there had been any thing ab&s;urd or unrea&s;onable in the chri&s;tian religion; any thing which a wi&s;e man ought to have been a&s;hamed to patroni&s;e:&mdash;There were Ju&s;tin Martyr, Tertullian, Origen, Minucius Felix and others, who&s;e writings in favor of chri&s;tianity &s;hew them to have been men of penetrating geniu&s;es and va&s;t erudition. Nor could they be induced to embrace this cau&s;e by any worldly motives: The&s;e were all on the other &s;ide. The cau&s;e was then de&s;pi&s;ed and per&s;ecuted by the powers of the world. They could be influenced only by the evidence of truth. Nor have there been wanting all along &s;uch men, who have not been a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But in later days, and in the land of our fore|fathers, there have been, among the friends of chri&s;tianity, per&s;ons who are acknowledged, thro' all the learned world, to have been eminent for their learning and talent of rea&s;oning; &s;uch as Doctors S. Clarke, Butler, Chandler, Leland, Lardner, Ben&s;on, &amp;c. The&s;e men appear from their writings to have been entirely free from enthu&s;ia&s;m and &s;uper&s;tition, impartial enquirers after truth, with peculiar abilities for di&s;covering it. But it may be &s;aid that being mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, they were, in a &s;en&s;e, bribed to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e, their <HI>living</HI> depending upon the credit and &s;upport of it. If any man, after attending to the marks of penetration and integrity which their writings di&s;cover, can think this objection
<PB N="27" REF="016306_0025_0F9C1F490E7BAFF8">
&s;ufficient to invalidate their te&s;timony, it will be to no purpo&s;e for me to attempt to convince him of the contrary. There are however other per&s;ons, with equal ju&s;tice, famed for their mental abilities, who have declared for the &s;ame cau&s;e, again&s;t whom this objection does not lie. I have particularly in view Mr. Boyle, Mr. Locke, Sir I. Newton, Mr. Addi&s;on, the late Lord Littleton, &amp;c. The&s;e were all men, who&s;e character for erudition and accurate rea&s;oning has been long e&s;tabli&s;hed in the republic of literature; and tho' no clergymen, they were not a&s;hamed to employ their pens in the cau&s;e of revelation, and thought it their duty and their honor to become the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t. Some of the&s;e men who have been mentioned were perhaps as great ma&s;ters of rea&s;on as any age or country ever produced; and after examin|ing the evidences of the go&s;pel with great care and diligence, and hearing all the objections of its adver&s;aries, they were fully convinced of its divine original. How &s;urpri&s;ing then, is it, that &s;o many per&s;ons of the pre&s;ent day, who have &s;carcely abilities to trace one of the ea&s;ie&s;t of Sir I&s;aac's demon&s;trations, or under&s;tand a &s;ingle page of Locke's e&s;&s;ay, &s;hould pretend to di&s;cover that the new te&s;tament is all a forgery, unworthy of credit! But there have not been wanting, in our own country, men eminent for their literary abilities and acquirements, who have &s;ub&s;cribed to the truth of chri&s;tianity. You will, no doubt think of my excellent predece&s;&s;or in the work of the mini&s;try as one in&s;tance of this.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. J. MAYHEW, D. D.</NOTE> Others of

the &s;ame <HI>order,</HI> both living and dead, might be mentioned. But I mean to take particular notice only of one, who was no clergyman; one who was lately an honor to his country, a di&s;tingui&s;h|ed ornament and ble&s;&s;ing to our College, and the delight and pride of his friends; but is now, alas! no more;&mdash;the learned Profe&s;&s;or, Doctor Winthrop.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He died May 3d, 1779.</NOTE> You have probably many of you &s;een his te&s;timony, delivered the day before he died, in favor of the divine original of the holy &s;criptures; in which, among other things he &s;ays, <Q>The light thrown upon the doctrine of a future &s;tate by the glorious go&s;pel, with me amounts to a demon&s;tration. The hope that is &s;et before us in the New-Te&s;tament, is the only thing which will &s;upport a man in his dying hour. If any man builds upon any other foundation, in my apprehen&s;ion, his founda|tion will fail.</Q> But it was not only as a dying man that he &s;hewed him&s;elf a believer in chri&s;tianity. He was a public profe&s;&s;or of it, a great part of his life; and his careful conformity to its precepts proved that he was a &s;incere one. He frequently took occa&s;ion, among his friends, both to plea&s;e and in&s;truct them by making ob&s;ervations for illu&s;trating the &s;en&s;e, and con|firming the authority, of revelation. In a pri|vate conver&s;ation with me, not a great while ago, he gave me a fre&s;h and convincing evidence of his firm attachment to chri&s;tianity: He ex|pre&s;&s;ed his grief at-the neglect with which many among us were di&s;po&s;ed to treat it at this day. I wi&s;h, &s;ays he, the pre&s;ent generation would
<PB N="29" REF="016306_0027_0F9C1F4A90AF9370">
remember the de&s;ign upon which their fore|fathers came into this country, and the regard they &s;hewed to religion in all their tran&s;actions: and con&s;ider, that they meant to hand down their religion as well as their worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to their po&s;terity. He &s;poke particularly of the rea&s;onablene&s;s of ob&s;erving the po&s;itive in&s;titu|tions of Chri&s;t; and &s;aid that he did not &s;ee how the neglect of them could be excu&s;ed, or what rea&s;on any man, who called him&s;elf a chri&s;tian, could give for &s;uch neglect. Though I am not certain that I have exactly recited his words, I am confident that I have not mi&s;repre|&s;ented the &s;en&s;e of what he &s;aid, though I may not have given the whole of it.</P>
<P>Now this te&s;timony of Dr. Winthrop mu&s;t be a good evidence to tho&s;e who knew his cha|racter, that it argues neither ignorance, weak|ne&s;s, &s;uper&s;tition or enthu&s;ia&s;m, to believe the go&s;pel. He was naturally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great &s;trength of mind and clearne&s;s of conception: By a clo&s;e application to &s;tudies he had intimately acquainted him&s;elf with mo&s;t of the branches of human learning, and in &s;ome of them &s;hone without a rival in this part of the world: He had accumulated and dige&s;ted a degree of know|ledge that &s;eldom falls to the &s;hare of one man: By his pur&s;uit of mathematical &s;tudies he had acquired a habit of ju&s;t rea&s;oning, and of &s;u&s;|pending his belief till he &s;aw evidence to &s;upport it;&mdash;the natural con&s;equence of &s;uch &s;tudies: The integrity of his heart rendered him a fair and impartial rea&s;oner: His <HI>Lectures,</HI> and the
<PB N="30" REF="016306_0028_0F9C1F4C418C83D0">
few publications with which he favoured the world, &s;hewed him to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of uncommon talents for inve&s;tigating, as well as for communicating truth: He had &s;tudied the holy &s;criptures in their original languages with critical attention: He was thoroughly acquaint|ed with the controver&s;y between chri&s;tians and dei&s;ts, and had read all the objections of infi|delity. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch advantages, there is, I think, the highe&s;t probability that his opinion concerning the authority of revelation was ju&s;t. This, you have heard, was, that the holy &s;crip|tures are the word of God: In this faith he lived and died.</P>
<P>Since then revelation has had &s;uch friends, need any man blu&s;h to own him&s;elf a chri&s;tian! Yea, would not a mode&s;t man be a&s;hamed to reject chri&s;tianity without the fulle&s;t evidence of its fal&s;ehood, when it has been pronounced true, by men of &s;uch learning and abilities, after the &s;tricte&s;t examination? I do not mean that the au|thority or te&s;timony of any unin&s;pired man, or number of men ought&punc; to govern our religious belief, when we have opportunity to examine for our&s;elves; which is the right and duty of all. But having &s;uch names among the friends of re|velation, mu&s;t at lea&s;t &s;hew that a belief of the go&s;pel may be the re&s;ult of careful enquiry, con|ducted with impartiality and great mental abili|ties. But enough, I tru&s;t, has been &s;aid to &s;hew that chri&s;tians have rea&s;on to glory in, rather than to be a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.&mdash; A brief application of the &s;ubject &s;hall conclude my di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

If there be any per&s;ons pre&s;ent, who think it di&s;honorable to believe chri&s;tanity, and for that rea&s;on are di&s;po&s;ed to reject it without ex|amination, or to neglect any of the duties of it, let me particularly recommend to their con&s;ider|ation what has been offered in the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e. Let them treat religion fairly, and give it a candid and careful examination before they &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t it. The la&s;t argument that was urged &s;hould be &s;ufficient to induce them to this, without any other con&s;ideration. Will you not acknowledge, that he would act a very fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd part, who &s;hould take upon him to contradict and ridicule the mathe|matical or philo&s;ophical opinions of tho&s;e great men who were there mentioned, without any evidence of their fal&s;hood? And can it be le&s;s ab&s;urd and fooli&s;h to treat their religious opi|nions in this way, without examining them? If human authority is to have any influence in this affair, as it is rea&s;onable that it &s;hould, with tho&s;e who have not examined for them&s;elves; <HI>that</HI> of the&s;e men ought to weigh more than that of all tho&s;e who have ever wrote again&s;t revelation, from Cel&s;us and Julian, the apo&s;tate, down to the pre&s;ent day. Infidelity has no names to boa&s;t of among its advocates, to be compared with the&s;e, for learning, penetration, ju&s;t rea&s;oning and integrity of heart: And if you will be implicit believers, they are as worthy to be confided in, as any unin&s;pired men that ever lived in the world;&mdash;much more &s;o than a Shaft&s;bury or a Wool&s;ton, a Tindal or a Collins, a Morgan or a

Bolinbroke; or even than the accute and &s;ubtle Hume, or that univer&s;al apo&s;tle of infidelity, the gay and &s;prightly Voltaire. And whether mo&s;t of our modern infidels are not the implicit di&s;ci|ples of the&s;e or other revilers of religion, let tho&s;e judge who know how illiterate and unac|quainted with the controver&s;y concerning the truth of the go&s;pel, they generally are. But let me tell you, my brethren, that almo&s;t all the writers again&s;t revelation manife&s;t &s;uch unfairne&s;s of mind, &s;uch want of candor, by their mi&s;repre|&s;entations and &s;ophi&s;try, as render them unfit to be tru&s;ted without great caution. But perhaps it is in imitation of the free-thinkers and gay-livers of our own time and country, that &s;o many among us are di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;t on the &s;ide of infi|delity. But do you know or have you known any man among the&s;e, &s;o likely to form a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion re&s;pecting the truth of the go&s;pel as <HI>our</HI> late excellent Profe&s;&s;or?&mdash;Any who had equal advantages for examining this point, and who have con&s;idered it with equal attention and impartiality? This you will not pretend. And I doubt not but every impartial, rea&s;onable man, will acknowledge that his &s;ingle te&s;timony, in this ca&s;e, ought to weigh more than that of all the infidels this country has ever produced, however fruitful it may lately have been in the&s;e degene|rate plants; and that it would be more honora|ble to be an implicit believer in him than in them. However I do not mean, that you &s;hould build your religion upon human authority, as has been intimated before: I would rather exhort you to

&s;tudy the &s;criptures and their evidences for your|&s;elves, that your faith may not &s;tand in the wi&s;|dom of men, but in the power of God. Prove all things; hold fa&s;t that which is good.</P>
<P N="5">5. FINALLY, Let me recommend it to pa|rents, and tho&s;e who have the care of young per&s;ons, to endeavor early to impre&s;s them with a &s;en&s;e of the excellency of the chri&s;tian religion, with ju&s;t notions of honor, and a reverence for God; and teach them that there is nothing &s;o &s;hameful as vice and impiety. Let them caution them again&s;t the company and books of the ene|mies of revelation; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"The danger to be &s;ure is not great, le&s;t tho&s;e profound philo&s;ophers the modern dei&s;ts &s;hould gain many pro|&s;elytes, except among people of their own pitch of un|der&s;tanding. But youth, who have not had their belief of chri&s;tianity e&s;tabli&s;hed in a convincing manner upon a thorough knowledge of its evidences, are liable to be drawn a&s;ide by the mo&s;t wretched &s;ophi&s;try. They ought therefore to be forewarned and prepared for the cavils (poor and feeble as they are) of that unhappy &s;et of men, who rea&s;on as a per&s;on might be expected to do, who was born with wrong &s;ide of his brain up|wards; and may be &s;afely told, That the following are two or three of their mo&s;t formidable arguments again&s;t the chri&s;tian religion. <Q>That it can never &s;ignify much, whether mankind believe or reject the chri&s;ti|an faith, if their practi&s;e be right.</Q> Which is much about as good &s;en&s;e as to &s;ay, It is no great matter, whether the mo&s;t effectual method that can be imagined, for compa&s;&s;ing a de&s;ign, be taken, &s;o the de&s;ign be compa&s;&s;ed, or That it does not much &s;ignify, in rai&s;ing a &s;tructure, whether a good foundation be laid or not, &s;o the &s;tructure be rai&s;ed. Again, That the light of rea&s;on is "&s;ufficient for mankind, and that revelation is of no manner of u&s;e, and therefore ought to be re|jected." Which, &s;etting a&s;ide its being found by ex|perience, That the light of rea&s;on and revelation both are not too much, is to the &s;ame purpo&s;e as to &s;ay, The naked eye is &s;ufficient to &s;hew us, that there are planets in the &s;ky, and therefore tele&s;copes are of no manner of u&s;e in a&s;tronomy, though they may &s;hew us many &s;urprizing phenomena in each of them, that never were thought of before the invention of that noble in|&s;trument. <Q>That morality is all, and therefore the rejection of a particular revelation can never be di&s;|plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of God.</Q> As if it was not as much an immorality and as criminal in the &s;ight of God to oppo&s;e, or even to neglect what comes with all the characters, internal and external, of a revelation from him, as to injure one's neighbour. <Q>That chri&s;tianity cannot be a revelation from God, el&s;e it had been communicated with equal advantage to all mankind."</Q> Which is as good left-handed arguing, as to &s;ay, That rea&s;on cannot be the gift of God, el&s;e it had been communicated with equal advantages to every idiot as to Sir I&s;aac Newton." <BIBL>Dr. CHANDLER's thoughts on education.</BIBL></P></NOTE> and by precept and exam|ple

endeavor to lead them to the love, the wor|&s;hip and obedience of the God of their fathers.</P>
<P>To conclude: May the father of mercies pre|&s;erve us all from an evil heart of unbelief, in depart|ing from the living God, and revive his own work among us: May he who commanded the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, &s;hine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that being fol|lowers of them who through FAITH and patience are now inheriting the promi&s;es, we may be able to meet our Judge in peace, and not be <HI>a&s;hamed</HI> before him, at his coming.</P>
