<HEAD>A LETTER TO <HI>Certain Bank Directors.</HI></HEAD>
<P>"EXCESSIVE U&s;ury," it has been &s;aid,
<Q>is the mo&s;t unequivocal proof of the the imbecility of States, or &s;ymptom of &s;ome <HI>internal vice</HI> which corrodes them, and is often the harbinger of the mo&s;t terrible cata&s;|trophes.</Q></P>
<P>I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to the adoption of this ob&s;ervation from a con&s;ideration of the unparalleled <HI>extortions</HI> that are daily and openly practi&s;ed in this city&mdash; <HI>in the purcha&s;e and &s;ale of Promi&s;&s;ory Notes</HI>&mdash;to the di&s;grace of civilization and of the national character.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="030688_0003_0fe875dd2572b738">Where mu&s;t this end?</P>
<P>My enquiries into the cau&s;es of the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es, are frequently an&s;wered by a reference to the injuries and lo&s;&s;es our merchants have &s;u&s;tained by the unju&s;t capture of our ve&s;&s;els at &s;ea, and their illegal detention.</P>
<P>The&s;e evils, it cannot be di&s;puted, are &s;erious and deeply afflictive: but it mu&s;t not be di&s;gui&s;ed that calamity is not confined to that range&mdash;it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to a cau&s;e, operating in various forms, no le&s;s fatal, though not &s;o &s;triking to the public di&s;cernment&mdash;the &s;hameful <HI>monopolizing principle</HI> adopted by the Banks, of di&s;counting for tho&s;e only who can make large depo&s;its, or, as it is termed, "KEEP GOOD ACCOUNTS."</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider that the aggregate capital of the &s;everal Banks in this city, amounts to &s;o many millions of dollars, and (making a due allowance for &s;uch parts thereof as cannot but remain inactive at pre&s;ent,) hear complaints &s;o univer&s;al, and credit &s;uffering &s;o inten&s;ely every day, my a&s;toni&s;hment at the public blind|ne&s;s or indifference, is greater than I can expre&s;s!</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="030688_0004_0fe875e3ede35080">I naturally enquire, and wonder that other men do not enquire al&s;o, <HI>How is this amazing &s;um di&s;po&s;ed of</HI> EVERY SIXTY DAYS <HI>with &s;o little general &s;atisfaction</HI>&mdash;with &s;uch misfortunes hourly ari&s;ing, and &s;uch funds at hand?</P>
<P>It is in vain that I labour to find a &s;atisfactory re&s;olution of this important que&s;tion: The man mo&s;t bia&s;&s;ed by intere&s;t cannot &s;ay it is impar|tially&mdash;no candid man that it is ju&s;tly di&s;po&s;ed of&mdash;or that it is laid out in the manner mo&s;t
<Q>u&s;eful to the commerce and agriculture of the State,</Q>
or to produce the mo&s;t
<Q>con&s;iderable advantages to <HI>trade</HI> and <HI>indu&s;try</HI> in general,</Q>
as was contemplated by the &s;everal Acts of In|corporation.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the extent of the injuries and lo&s;&s;es the merchants have &s;u&s;tained by the capture of their ve&s;&s;els and other property, they mu&s;t be con&s;idered as part of the con&s;equences flowing from their own proceedings in promoting the adoption of a Treaty, which, in&s;tead of healing the fir&s;t affliction, hath confirmed it into a di&s;ea&s;e, and threatens to add di&s;orders &s;till more grievous.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="030688_0005_0fe875e573aa22a0">This mea&s;ure of politics, however, but par|tially relates to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, ina&s;much, as it is only an external aggravation of di&s;orders, which already exi&s;t internally, radically pernicious, and fraught with generative de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t it not be a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment to every well informed man&mdash;mu&s;t it not be di&s;gu&s;t|ing to very man not totally ab&s;orbed in <HI>avarice,</HI> to be told, that an individual of the be&s;t credit &s;hall not be entitled to accommodation at a public in&s;titution, becau&s;e he will not &s;uffer his money to <HI>lie dead in Bank.</HI> What is the true character of &s;uch a &s;trange procedure, is it not demanding <HI>a depo&s;it</HI> of money, and at the &s;ame time exacting <HI>a di&s;count</HI> for the u&s;e of a part of it? Is it not paying intere&s;t to the borrower for the u&s;e of the lender's money!</P>
<P>Yet &s;uch are the &s;hameful extortions openly avowed, notwith&s;tanding <HI>two</HI> of the charters of the&s;e public in&s;titutions were granted
<Q>under &s;uch <HI>limitations</HI> and <HI>re&s;trictions</HI> as not to become an object of <HI>jealou&s;y</HI> or <HI>apprehen&s;ion</HI> to the good people of the States;</Q>
&mdash;and&mdash;
<Q>to the intent that <HI>the Citizens of the State</HI> might not be oppre&s;&s;ed!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="030688_0006_0fe875ec5a46e5f0">A mo&s;t eminent author <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Smith's Wealth of Nations, p. 319.</NOTE> &s;ays,
<Q>It is not by augmenting the capital of a country, but by rendering a greater part of that capital <HI>active</HI> and <HI>productive</HI> than would otherwi&s;e be &s;o, that <HI>the mo&s;t judicious operations of banking</HI> can encrea&s;e the indu&s;try of the country. That part of the capital which a dealer is obliged to keep by him <HI>unemployed</HI> and in ready money for an&s;wering occa&s;ional demands, <HI>is &s;o much</HI> DEAD STOCK; which, &s;o long as it re|mains in this &s;ituation <HI>produces nothing to him or to his country.</HI> The <HI>judicious operations of bank|ing</HI> enable him to convert his <HI>dead &s;tock</HI> into <HI>active</HI> and <HI>productive &s;tock.</HI></Q>
How contrary is this doctrine to the &s;hamefully extortionate and u&s;urious "New invention of ca&s;hiering" now pur&s;ued, as it has been termed by Sir Jo&s;hua Child! How different from the principles of the "Mons Pietatis" of the Bi&s;hop of Padua, who (in 1490) e&s;tabli&s;hed a Bank <HI>purpo&s;ely to counteract &s;imilar extortion and u&s;ury in tho&s;e days</HI>!</P>
<P>One of the principal motives for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the <HI>Bank Royale</HI> of Paris was, that
<Q>it would make u&s;ury to cea&s;e <NOTE N="(2)" PLACE="foot">Beawe's Lex Mer. p. 328.</NOTE>;</Q>
and the
<PB N="8" REF="030688_0007_0fe875ede0eb69f8">Bank of England, we are told <NOTE N="(3)" PLACE="foot">Po&s;tleth. Dict. Art. Banking; and 3 Ander&s;on Com. 141.</NOTE>, is an inva|luable accommodation to the community, becau&s;e it has a tendency <HI>to keep low the intere&s;t of money,</HI> and is
<Q><HI>an effectual and permanent check to u&s;ury,</HI> which is the greate&s;t bane to trade and na|vigations.</Q></P>
<P>It has been &s;aid <NOTE N="(4)" PLACE="foot">Coxe's U.S. 480.</NOTE> that the organization of our banks is on a plan and principles nearly uniform with, and <HI>like to tho&s;e of the Bank of Eng|land.</HI> Why then are effects produced &s;o very oppo&s;ite and extraordinary? How comes it that the &s;y&s;tem upon which our banks are conducted at pre&s;ent can only create further di&s;tre&s;&s;es <HI>among all tho&s;e who have not been engaged in their extortions</HI>? How comes it that they throw <HI>into the hands of u&s;ury</HI> the means whereby to play with redoubled cruelty upon tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es which they at fir&s;t create?</P>
<P>I have been referred to individuals in <HI>Mulberry-&s;treet&mdash;Che&s;nut-&s;treet&mdash;Second-&s;treet&mdash;Third-&s;treet&mdash; Water-&s;treet,</HI> and <HI>other &s;treets,</HI> as known u&s;urers, or AGENTS acting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or COMPANIES OF
<PB N="9" REF="030688_0008_0fe875f4c700fbe8">USURERS! and I have been confidently a&s;&s;ured that tho&s;e very individuals (with &s;hame be it mentioned!) <HI>can, and do obtain di&s;counts regularly</HI> at <HI>two</HI> of the Banks!</P>
<P>Whether there is cau&s;e for &s;u&s;picion that &s;eve|ral Bank Directors are intimately concerned in &s;ome of tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments or not, may be in|ferred from the following circum&s;tances of a con|ver&s;ation which took place a few days ago. A Director was met by a Broker, whom he ad|dre&s;&s;ed in languague and effect nearly as memory can collect thus,
<Q>For &s;hame, J&mdash;, for &s;hame! why will you not pur&s;ue &s;ome regular bu&s;ine&s;s, in preference to being in&s;trumental to the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of your neighbours?</Q>
&mdash;To which the Jew replied&mdash;
<Q>Got damn! fwhat haf you to do mid it! I &s;ells more note&s;h to Bank Tirectors dan to efry pody el&s;e!</Q>
&mdash;I &s;hould not omit adding, that this very Director has been &s;ince charged, as I am well informed, <HI>openly to his face,</HI> with purcha&s;ing notes!</P>
<P>Some Directors, influenced more by private motives, than a regard for the duties of their appointment and the credit and character of the in&s;titutions, make it a practice to examine the
<PB N="10" REF="030688_0009_0fe875f64c759728">Bank Books of individuals, and where complaints are made of the <HI>reduction of di&s;counts</HI> without cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned, to offer as a rea&s;on, this &s;ort of reply&mdash; "You trade beyond your capital;" as if a man's Bank Book &s;tood in the place of his ledger! Pre&s;umptuous Dictators! who inve&s;ted you with the in&s;olent authority of inqui&s;itors? Have you forgot from whence each of you &s;prang&mdash;that to capital you owe nothing, to <HI>credit</HI> your very exi&s;tence!</P>
<P>It is allowed by all experienced men that
<Q>commerce cannot exi&s;t without mutual and exten&s;ive credit.</Q>
&mdash;Men of the moment, be cautious!&mdash;you have &s;ins to an&s;wer for&mdash;recollect that
<Q>credit is gained by cu&s;tom and &s;eldom recovers a &s;train</Q>
&mdash;read Ander&s;on, and learn what <HI>Banks</HI> are.</P>
<P>"Although like private merchants," &s;ays he
<Q>their circum&s;tances may not be alike pro&s;pe|rous at all times, we can &s;ee no benefit that can ari&s;e by &s;uch <HI>minute enquiries,</HI> &s;o long as they, to all appearance, are pro&s;perous and punctual in all their affairs; neither do we apprehend the&s;e <HI>proper to be enquired into at all,</HI> unle&s;s there &s;hould ari&s;e any rea&s;onable &s;u&s;picion of fraud: for as it has been a political ob&s;ervation of
<PB N="11" REF="030688_0010_0fe875fd35973918">long &s;tanding, that even the reputation of great and powerful <HI>Monarchies</HI> and <HI>States,</HI> often &s;ub&s;i&s;t more by common fame or opinion than by real &s;trength or ability,&mdash;<HI>magis fama quam vi</HI>&mdash;&s;o it may more &s;trictly and properly be applicable to a Bank and Bankers, of which we had a mo&s;t pregnant in&s;tance a few years ago, at the breaking up and dividing the pro|fits of <HI>an eminent partner&s;hip</HI> of a <HI>private bank</HI> in London, which, for <HI>many years,</HI> had cleared or divided <HI>&s;everal thou&s;and pounds yearly</HI> for the partner&s;hip; when upon valuing or apprai&s;ing all the <HI>real &s;tock</HI> of the partner&s;hip before the highe&s;t judge of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> it appeared, even to that great man's amazement, that the whole did not amount to above <HI>three or four hundred pounds,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting entirely of &s;hop implements, and certain hou&s;ehold furniture,</Q>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>A certain Director &s;ome time &s;ince, upon an <HI>iron merchant</HI>'s applying to him, to know what were the objections to the paper which he had offered at Bank that had not been di&s;counted, was told, "<HI>You &s;hould &s;ell your iron</HI>!" This &s;apient Director had, a day or two before, been applying him&s;elf <HI>for the iron</HI>; but the <HI>ironmonger</HI> expecting (as the Director al&s;o expected) that the price of iron
<PB N="12" REF="030688_0011_0fe875fec04ea4d0">would ri&s;e, preferred borrowing ca&s;h, to &s;elling goods to the Director at a ri&s;k of great di&s;advan|tage in the cour&s;e of trade.</P>
<P>Herein may be di&s;cerned the power acquired and the means u&s;ed to profit by a knowlege of the apparent &s;tate of individual credit as exhibited in their <HI>Bank Books</HI>&mdash;and in this way it is that we can account for numerous objections to the di&s;|counting of good notes.</P>
<P>If the Directory of a Bank can <HI>occa&s;ionally</HI> have "<HI>twenty thou&s;and dollars</HI>" divided among them|&s;elves <HI>in one day,</HI> more than is u&s;ual and cu&s;tomary for them to have di&s;counted (which actually happened a few days &s;ince) they may with great ea&s;e keep "<HI>good accounts,</HI>" and out of the <HI>profits only</HI> by &s;uch purcha&s;es&mdash;hopeful Directors!&mdash; gracele&s;s depo&s;its!</P>
<P>When the Bank of England was in&s;tituted there were but <HI>four</HI> great or con&s;iderable Banks in Europe, all of which, excepting that of Genoa alone, were <HI>&s;olely for the convenience of merchants</HI> <NOTE N="(5)" PLACE="foot">3 Ander&s;on 141.</NOTE>; but our banks, by their &s;y&s;tem of "good ac|counts,"
<PB N="13" REF="030688_0012_0fe87605a3f54ab0">openly and avowedly give u&s;ury the preference to the merchant.</P>
<P>Will this mode of proceeding
<Q>make money plentiful, <HI>trade ea&s;y and &s;ecure,</HI> rai&s;e the price of lands, <HI>draw the &s;pecies of gold and &s;ilver into the hands of the common people,</HI></Q>

A few days after, the &s;tationer &s;ent his new and pretty Bank-Book to the Bank, to get a <HI>&s;mall note wrote in</HI>; to his &s;urpri&s;e his pretty book was returned with a credit for a note which had been di&s;counted (FOR THE DIRECTOR) for "eighteen thou&s;and dollars."&mdash;The accidental re&s;emblance of two elegant <HI>Bank-Books</HI> cau&s;ed this mi&s;take, but it al&s;o di&s;covered <HI>a fact</HI> that points with &s;ilent energy, at the Bank proceed|ings; if each Director had the like <HI>indulgence</HI> on the &s;ame day, the immen&s;e &s;um of 350,000 dol|lars mu&s;t have been at once divided among them.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="030688_0018_0fe8761f24671b68">An <HI>extra</HI> &s;um of 20,000 dollars occa&s;ionally added to &s;uch a &s;um as this, mu&s;t make a Bank Director's place a <HI>very convenient and eligible one</HI>&mdash; and it may no longer be a matter of wonder that Directors can with ea&s;e keep "<HI>a good ac|count.</HI>"</P>
<P>But "the &s;pecie has all left the country," &s;ays SPECIOUSUS; "we are obliged <HI>daily to curtail our di&s;counts,</HI>" &s;ays HIPOCRITUS;&mdash;
<Q>give to each a little, <HI>divide it among you,</HI></Q>
&s;ays AVIDIUS;&mdash;
<Q>But we can divide it only among tho&s;e <HI>who keep</HI> GOOD ACCOUNTS,</Q>
exclaim one and all!</P>
<P><Q><L>At midnight thus the mi&s;er &s;teals untrack'd! amid his &s;tore</L>
<L>And gra&s;ps&mdash;and gra&s;ps&mdash;till he can hold no more;</L>
<L>And when his &s;trength is wanting to his mind</L>
<L>Looks back and &s;ighs&mdash;<HI>on what he left behind.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>It has been wi&s;ely &s;aid, that
<Q>the circulating medium being the <HI>&s;oul</HI> and <HI>food</HI> of commerce, a corporation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a power of the <HI>&s;oul</HI> can <HI>animate</HI> or <HI>annihilate</HI> the body at plea&s;ure;</Q>
if this mi&s;erly monopolizing &s;pirit is pur&s;ued, the body mu&s;t indeed die a painful and lingering death and carry contagion and ruin into its cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="030688_0019_0fe87620aa626338">
<Q>A monopoly of the circulating medium is an univer&s;al <HI>power of embargo</HI> over trade, agri|culture and manufactures,</Q>
and it is immaterial whether it is depo&s;ited or u&s;urped in the hands of a few. "Banking in its be&s;t view" &s;ays an emi|nent writer,
<Q>is only a &s;pecies of <HI>fraud</HI> whereby labor &s;uffers the impo&s;ition of paying <HI>an intere&s;t</HI> on the circulating medium.</Q>
That banking fairly exerci&s;ed may be dive&s;ted of its fraudful cha|racter is beyond di&s;pute; but that the circulating medium is the creature of labor is no le&s;s true; to render the creator &s;ubject to the creature is an in|ver&s;ion of all principles rational and moral, which was left for the banks to realize in this
<Q><HI>mo&s;t en|lightened and free nation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>If there were not the examples of the bank of England, of Am&s;terdam, of Venice, of Edinburg, and &s;o many others i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Europe, the experience which we have had, which every day and every hour lives before us, di&s;plays and calls for the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a <HI>regular, periodical, and general change of the directors</HI> in each <HI>of the banks,</HI> and <HI>that each director</HI> (as is the ca&s;e at Baltimore and el&s;ewhere) &s;hould be appointed under <HI>a very &s;pecial oath of qualificati|on.</HI> The directors of the bank of Am&s;terdam are
<PB N="21" REF="030688_0020_0fe87627aa57a150">&s;worn when <HI>they leave the in&s;titution</HI> as well as when they fir&s;t accept the charge. I do not wi&s;h to ob|lige the pre&s;ent directors to &s;wear for the time pa&s;t &mdash;that would be too hard upon them!&mdash;I only &s;ugge&s;t its future propriety.</P>
<P><HI>Perjury</HI> is a horrible crime, it is puni&s;hed in En|gland with the Pillory&mdash;and it is remarkable e|nough that <HI>U&s;ury</HI> is treated in the &s;ame way;<NOTE N="(14)" PLACE="foot">3 Ander&s;on 179.</NOTE> &s;hould not <HI>brokers and their infamous bargains</HI> be put up for &s;hame and &s;corn's pointing finger. A &s;i|milarly infamous <HI>&s;tock jobbing &s;y&s;tem,</HI> which is &s;aid to have cau&s;ed the citizens of London
<Q>to <HI>decline trade and turn u&s;urers,</HI></Q>
aro&s;e to &s;o dangerous a height as to require the interference of the National Le|gi&s;lature, and the pa&s;&s;ing of an act of Parliament, which re&s;trained the brokers to a <HI>certain number,</HI> from acting <HI>without a licence</HI> from the Lord Mayor; it obliged them to take an oath of fidelity,&mdash;their names to be written on the Royal Exchange;&mdash;to incur a penalty if they dealt in &s;uch articles them|&s;elves, and to enter into an obligation for their faithful actings, and in failure to forfeit 500 pounds;<NOTE N="(15)" PLACE="foot">3 Ander. 179.</NOTE> and it is el&s;where &s;aid,<NOTE N="(16)" PLACE="foot">4 Black&s;.

<PB N="22" REF="030688_0021_0fe8762931b791d0">guilty of &s;uch u&s;urious acts as are daily com|mitted here with impunity would &s;ubject them to the penalties of a <HI>Praemunire.</HI></P>
<P>Legi&s;lative interference is unque&s;tionably called for, to guard us again&s;t the evils flowing from &s;uch &s;candalous abu&s;es; and at the &s;ame time, &s;ince,
<Q>where paper money is pretty much confined to the circulation between dealer and dealer, as at London, there <HI>is always plenty</HI> of gold and &s;ilver,</Q><NOTE N="(17)" PLACE="foot">Smith's W. of N. 322.</NOTE>
it would be of great public benefit if the i&s;&s;uing of Bank Paper could be re&s;tricted to <HI>notes of not le&s;s than twenty dollars.</HI></P>
<P>The election for Directors of the &s;everal Banks will &s;hortly come on&mdash;the&s;e remarks will require the con&s;ideration of the Stockholders, and it is hoped that the indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of a frequent and general change in the &s;everal Directions, will be now con&s;idered as &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated. A per&s;onal expo&s;ition of names and per&s;ons has been avoided, becau&s;e every one concerned that chu&s;es to enquire, can apply the facts with the proof of them; the &s;y&s;tem admits of abu&s;es, and it &s;hould obtain the correction of frequent
<PB N="23" REF="030688_0022_0fe8759807d781e0">change of per&s;ons, and every preventive of regu|lation and law that the public good and equal individual &s;ecurity demand.</P>
<P>That the <HI>State Legi&s;lature,</HI> will as much as is in their power attend to the correction of evils &s;o univer&s;ally and &s;everely felt, is mo&s;t earne&s;tly to be hoped for. Qualification oaths, appear to be an ea&s;y and nece&s;&s;ary preliminary &s;tep, which can be adapted to both the State Banks. It is likewi&s;e to be wi&s;hed, and it appears to be &s;ignally incumbent on the LEGISLATURE of the UNITED STATES, to take up a &s;ubject involving the be&s;t and deare&s;t intere&s;ts of the nation.</P>
<Q><L>Mi&s;chiefs are like the Cockatrice's eye,</L>
<L>If they &s;ee fir&s;t, <HI>they kill</HI>&mdash;if &s;een, <HI>they die.</HI></L></Q>
