<P>I. Chri&s;t has great love for little chil|dren. He takes as much notice of them, and has as much kindne&s;s for them, as for any. How kindly and lovingly did he treat the&s;e children who were brought to him. He did not chide them for coming. He would not let them go, till he had taken them up into his arms, put his hands upon them, prayed for them, and given them his ble&s;&s;ing. His words and his actions towards them were full of love and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Among the Jews, good men u&s;ed to put their hands upon the heads of their children,
<PB N="5" REF="024390_0005_0FC704C42A6F4BE8">
and upon others who de&s;ired their ble&s;&s;ing, and to pray for them. And it has al&s;o been a pious cu&s;tom, among chri&s;tians, for children to a&s;k their parents ble&s;&s;ing, and to receive it, kneeling. And though it may not be much practi&s;ed at pre&s;ent, yet it &s;eems to have been a fit means of cheri&s;hing, in parents &amp; children, a &s;en&s;e of their duty towards each other. I mention this, that you may better under&s;tand why the&s;e children were brought to Chri&s;t. It was, that he might put his hands upon them and ble&s;s them.</P>
<P>When Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples would have hind|red their coming, it greatly di&s;plea&s;ed him. Such was his love for children that he could not bear to have them &s;lighted, or rebuked, when they were coming to him. And he is as much di&s;plea&s;ed now with tho&s;e who di&s;|courage children from &s;eeking the ble&s;&s;ings of his grace. No man ever had, or &s;hewed &s;o much love to little children as Chri&s;t. You have heard what kind words he &s;poke con|cerning them. Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not, for of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven. If you had heard him &s;peak the&s;e words, and then &s;een him take them up in his arms to ble&s;s them, would it not have affected you? Could you ever have forgotten &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions of love?</P>
<P>It was for the love he had for children, as well as others, that Chri&s;t came into the world, and went through much labour and hard&s;hip, and at la&s;t died upon the cro&s;s. All this he did to &s;ave them from the pains of ev|erla&s;ting
<PB N="6" REF="024390_0006_0FC704C546314420">
death, to which they were expo&s;ed, beacu&s;e of &s;in. For alas! we are all &s;inners, and have offended God our maker. Our hearts incline to be wicked. We often do, what we ought not, and neglect to do what God has commanded. We are full of evil thoughts. We often &s;peak and act ami&s;s.&mdash;Now, &s;in di&s;plea&s;es God, who is angry with the wicked; and the word of God a&s;&s;ures us, that "The wages of &s;in are death." Chil|dren, as well as others, are &s;inners, and &s;o mu&s;t be in a &s;ad condition, unle&s;s they be for|given, and reconciled to God.</P>
<P>Though God be merciful and willing to forgive &s;inners, upon their repentance, yet none can be delivered from &s;in and death without a Saviour. God, in his great mercy, appointed Chri&s;t, his eternal &s;on, to be the &s;aviour of men. And &s;o great was the love of Chri&s;t, that he was willing to be the &s;aviour, to come into the world, and become a man, to live a life of affliction, and &s;uffer the pains of death, for our &s;alvation. This &s;hews the greatne&s;s of his love to us. And remember, that Chri&s;t has done and &s;uffered all this for children, as well as others, that they might be &s;aved. Parents have great love for their children. You cannot conceive the tender concern they feel for you, when you are in trouble, or in danger. But no parents ever had &s;o much love for their deare&s;t children, or were willing to do and &s;uffer &s;o much for them, as Chri&s;t has done.</P>
<P>When he took fle&s;h upon him, he &s;hewed
<PB N="7" REF="024390_0007_0FC704C949A31638">
his great love to children, by becoming a child him&s;elf. He had a de&s;ign herein of &s;pecial kindne&s;s; that he might, from his own experience, have a fellow feeling of the afflictions and infirmities of that tender age; that children might be the more encouraged to carry all their complaints to him, who knows how to pity and comfort them; re|membering, that him&s;elf was once a child. Another de&s;ign which Chri&s;t had, in becom|ing a child like you, was to teach children, by his example, how they &s;hould behave.&mdash;When you read, that Je&s;us increa&s;ed in wi&s;|dom, and in favour with God and man, this &s;hould teach you, that children mu&s;t endea|vour to learn every thing that is good, and behave &s;o well, that God and all good men may love them. They &s;hould be dutiful and obedient to their parents, as Chri&s;t was.&mdash;They &s;hould attend religious duties, in the hou&s;e of God, as well as in private, as the child Je&s;us went up to the temple to wor&s;hip with his parents. All this &s;hews the pecu|liar love of Chri&s;t to children.</P>
<P>And though he has left this world, and gone up to heaven, where he reigns over all, upon a glorious throne, he has now the &s;ame love for children. He does not forget you, though you are &s;o apt to forget him. He &s;ees and takes notice of you by day and night.&mdash;He keeps you alive, and in health. He feeds and cloaths you, and gives you all your good things. If he &s;end affliction upon you, he means it for your good; as parents, &s;ome|times,
<PB N="8" REF="024390_0008_0FC704CEF7619108">
correct children, when they are wick|ed, in hopes it will do them good. When your friends are kind to you, it <HI>is Chri&s;t, who puts it into their hearts.</HI> He al&s;o takes care, that you have all the good in&s;truction you re|ceive from the word of God, from good books, and from your friends, that you may know what you mu&s;t do to be &s;aved. And if you get good by the in&s;tructions, which you re|ceive, if ever you feel any de&s;ire to for&s;ake &s;in, and become religious, it is Chri&s;t, who by his grace, has given this turn to your minds, and made you &s;en&s;ible of the wi&s;dom and happi|ne&s;s of remembering your creator, in the days of your youth. And now Chri&s;t is in heaven, he is preparing a place, for tho&s;e little ones, who belong to him, who love, and obey him.</P>
<P>Ought you not, then, dear children, to give Chri&s;t your hearts and endeavor to plea&s;e him? When children are wicked, they great|ly di&s;plea&s;e Chri&s;t. But when they love him, and &s;trive to do, as he commands, to learn that which is good, to obey their parents, to wor&s;hip God, and behave them&s;elves, as Chri&s;t did, when he was a child; and if they offend are &s;orry for it, beg forgivne&s;s for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and are careful to do &s;o no more, this is plea&s;ing to him, and he loves them the more. If Chri&s;t were here in the world, would you not wi&s;h to go to him, to &s;ee him, to hear him &s;peak, to be acquainted with him, in&s;truc|ted by him, and become his di&s;ciples?&mdash;I have then &s;omething to tell you, which you
<PB N="9" REF="024390_0009_0FC704D029EC2998">
have great rea&s;on to hearken to with joy and thankfulne&s;s: And that is,</P>
<P>II. <HI>That Chri&s;t would have little children come to him.</HI> This you may remember was the <HI>&s;econd ob&s;ervation</HI> on the text.</P>
<P>You have heard that Chri&s;t was much di&s;|plea&s;ed with his di&s;ciples, when they would have hindred tho&s;e little children who were coming to him. 'Let them come,' &s;ays he, 'and forbid them not.' And it is now his will, that children &s;hould come to him, and he is as free as ever to receive and ble&s;s them. He would have parents <HI>bring</HI> their little babes who cannot come them&s;elves. The&s;e he would have brought, and given to him in bapti&s;m. It is his will, that children come, and give <HI>them&s;elves</HI> to him, as &s;oon as they are capable. Parents &s;hould teach and encourage their children, lead and guide them to Chri&s;t, that they may know him, become acquaint|ed with him, and receive his ble&s;&s;ing. Chri&s;t now invites you all to come, and would receive you as gladly as ever a kind parent took up his little child, that went to him.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked, how &s;hall we come to Chri&s;t, now he is in heaven, and we upon earth?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, though our bodies cannot come to his body, now he is in heaven, and we upon earth, yet we may go to him with our minds, and hearts, by thinking of him, believing on him, loving him, &s;eeking in&s;truction from his word, con&s;enting, heartily, to have him for
<PB N="10" REF="024390_0010_0FC704D284687AA0">
our Saviour, to obey his commands, and &s;ub|mit to his di&s;po&s;al; tru&s;ting in his promi&s;es, and hoping for pardon and the favor of God, only, for the &s;ake of his merits. If you be|lieve that he is &s;uch a per&s;on as the &s;criptures declare him to be, if you de&s;ire and &s;eek Sal|vation from him, as he encourages and di|rects you; this is coming to him with <HI>your hearts,</HI> this is what he calls and invites you to do. And he is willing to &s;ave every one of you, from &s;in and ruin, if you thus look to him for it.</P>
<P>But that you may under&s;tand what it is to come to Chri&s;t in a right manner, and as he would have you do, I will endeavor to in&s;truct <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ou, as plainly as I can in a few words.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that you are &s;inners, that as &s;uch the great God is very angry with you, and you mu&s;t be forever undone, if you die without being forgiven, and reconciled to him.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t be convinced, that Chri&s;t <HI>only</HI> can &s;ave you from &s;in, and everla&s;ting de&s;truction, and make your peace with God, that he is <HI>able</HI> and <HI>willing</HI> to &s;ave all, who de&s;ire and &s;eek Salvation from him, as it is offered in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that you can <HI>do noth|ing</HI> for which you can <HI>de&s;erve,</HI> that God &s;hould &s;hew you mercy, pardon your &s;ins, and &s;ave your &s;ouls, that you are not <HI>able</HI> of <HI>your&s;elves</HI> to change your wicked hearts, and make your|&s;elves good&mdash;that if you are pardoned and &s;aved, it mu&s;t be for the &s;ake of Chri&s;ts merit
<PB N="11" REF="024390_0011_0FC704D4F19D8DA8">
and his interceding for you with God; and that he by his grace mu&s;t incline your hearts to love and fear God, and keep his command|ments. You mu&s;t not therefore depend upon your own righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength for Sal|vation, but on the righteou&s;ne&s;s and grace of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t be truly willing and de&s;irous to have Chri&s;t for your Saviour, to be taught by his word and &s;pirit and to own him as your ma&s;ter and Lord, to govern and keep you from &s;in and danger, and bring you &s;afely to heaven. You mu&s;t give your&s;elves <HI>wholly</HI> to him, and to God, through him; heartily &s;orrowing for all your &s;ins, and re&s;olving with|out delay to for&s;ake them all, and to do your duty to God and man; hoping for <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> and <HI>acceptance,</HI> through the <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>merit</HI> of Chri&s;t. This mu&s;t be your &s;teady re&s;olution and endeavor, as long as you live.</P>
<P>In this manner Chri&s;t would have all chil|dren come to him, as &s;oon as they are capa|ble. And they are capable, as &s;oon as they have under&s;tanding to receive in&s;truction, con|cerning their <HI>need</HI> of a &s;aviour, and that Chri&s;t is <HI>able</HI> and <HI>willing</HI> to &s;ave them, upon their &s;eeking Salvation from him, according to the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The di&s;plea&s;ure Chri&s;t expre&s;&s;ed at tho&s;e, who would have kept children away from him, &s;hews, that it was his will, that they &s;hould come. He plainly expre&s;&s;ed his <HI>will|ingne&s;s</HI> when he &s;aid "Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not." His
<PB N="12" REF="024390_0012_0FC704D639BAEA58">
coming into the world, and doing and &s;uffer|ing &s;o much to &s;ave them, from the pains of everla&s;ting death, is a clear proof, that he would <HI>mo&s;t willingly</HI> have them come, and re|ceive the ble&s;&s;ings of grace, which he has pur|cha&s;ed for children, as well as others, with his <HI>precious blood.</HI></P>
<P>Should not parents then be concerned to be <HI>workers together, with Chri&s;t,</HI> for the &s;alva|tion of their children, by training them up in the way wherein they &s;hould go, by praying with and for them, and leading them by their example, that &s;o they may be the in&s;truments of guiding and leading them <HI>to Chri&s;t, that they may be ble&s;&s;ed in him?</HI></P>
<P>And ought you not, my dear children, to give your&s;elves up, mo&s;t freely, to the kind and mo&s;t merciful Saviour who would have you come to him, that you may have everla&s;t|ing life, and is waiting with open arms, to re|ceive and ble&s;s you?</P>
<P>Will you &s;light and di&s;obey the invitation of him, who only can &s;ave you? If any of you &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing him, and the grace and mercy he offers, you will be mi&s;erable creatures. How &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neg|lect &s;o great &s;alvation!</P>
<P>But if you will receive, and give your&s;elves to Chri&s;t and &s;ubmit to him, as your teacher, your Lord, and Saviour, now in the days of your youth, you will be happy forever. God, and Chri&s;t, and angels, and good men, will re|joice over, and love you. You &s;hall want nothing that is for your real good. You &s;hall
<PB N="13" REF="024390_0013_0FC704D87B7E83B8">
find more <HI>comfort</HI> and <HI>joy,</HI> in &s;erving God than in all the <HI>plea&s;ures</HI> which &s;in or the world can give. You &s;hall be happy in <HI>life</HI> and in <HI>death,</HI> and you cannot conceive how great your happine&s;s will be in heaven, after this life is ended.</P>
<P>Remember, that <HI>now</HI> is the <HI>accepted time,</HI> and day of Salvation. You mu&s;t not delay <HI>one day</HI> or <HI>moment.</HI> If you do not <HI>now</HI> come to a <HI>full</HI> and <HI>hearty</HI> re&s;olution to hear the voice of Chri&s;t, in his word, and give your&s;elves up to God through him, I fear greatly that I have lo&s;t my labor, and done you no good.&mdash;"O that you were wi&s;e to con&s;ider your latter end," and "that you would know, in this your day, the things which belong to your peace." You know that children may die, as well as others. And if any of you &s;hould die, without an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and before your peace is made with God, my heart akes to think what mu&s;t become of you. <HI>To day,</HI> then if you will hear the voice of Chri&s;t, har|den <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> your hearts. Seek the Lord while he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> be found, call upon him, while he is nea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>I might further pre&s;s the exhortation from the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e <HI>vows</HI> and <HI>bonds</HI> un|der which, I &s;uppo&s;e, the mo&s;t of you have been laid in your bapti&s;m, when the token of your intere&s;t in the covenant, and of your be|ing members of the church, was put upon you. This is a good rea&s;on, why children &s;hould come to Chri&s;t. It is the rea&s;on which Chri&s;t him&s;elf has given&mdash;"Suffer little chil|dren
<PB N="14" REF="024390_0014_0FC704E180EAF470">
to come to me, and forbid them not, for of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven&mdash;But this brings us to the <HI>third ob&s;ervation.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>Little children belong to the kingdom of heaven.</HI>&mdash;There will be no need of arguing this point after Chri&s;t him&s;elf has affirmed it. He is a faithful and true witne&s;s.</P>
<P>It gives me <HI>joy,</HI> and may well fill you with <HI>wonder</HI> and <HI>thankfulne&s;s,</HI> that Chri&s;t has a&s;|&s;ured you, that children belong to the king|dom of heaven.</P>
<P>If we under&s;tand by the kingdom of heav|en, the <HI>&s;tate of the ble&s;&s;ed after this life is ended,</HI> little children are capable of enjoying the hap|pine&s;s of heaven, and many of them are heirs of this ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. Young babes will go to heaven as well as older people. And &s;o may children of &s;ome age and under&s;tanding, &s;uch as you are. Some good thing was found in young Abijah; and Jo&s;iah, while he was yet young, began to &s;eek God. And many while they were very young, have been lovely ex|amples of early piety. You may read an ac|count of &s;everal of the&s;e in the <HI>Token for chil|dren</HI> and other books. Now &s;uch as are good, however young they may be, are heirs of the <HI>kingdom of glory.</HI></P>
<P>Or if the kingdom of heaven be under&s;tood to mean the <HI>vi&s;ible church</HI> (which I take to be the meaning of the word in our text) it is &s;till true, that children belong to the church, as well as their parents. God has taken them into his covenant, and therefore they are bap|tized
<PB N="15" REF="024390_0015_0FC704E4A4084228">
and are to be watched over by the church, that they be not drawn into wicked practices, but taught to know and fear and &s;erve God. They are bound to this by the covenant God has put them under, and by their bapti&s;m, in which they are given to God, and Chri&s;t to be his &s;ervants.</P>
<P>And as it is a &s;pecial favor for you to have been born members of the church, and &s;o be|long to the kingdom of heaven upon earth, this is a &s;pecial rea&s;on why you &s;hould be con|cerned to come and freely give up your&s;elves to Chri&s;t, and to God through him, now you are grown to &s;ome mea&s;ure of capacity and under&s;tanding in things of religion. God's covenant, which you are under, binds you to him. You are of the number of his people, and planted in his vineyard. It is required and expected that you &s;hould be an example to tho&s;e whom he has not thus taken into the number of his covenant people, and admitted as members of his church. It will be a &s;ad aggravation of the wickedne&s;s of children, when they for&s;ake their fathers' God, after they have been laid under the bonds of the covenant, and have had greater advantages than others for knowing and &s;erving him. God will be more di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;uch, and deal more &s;everely with them, than with tho&s;e who have not been &s;o favored by him. Such wicked children of the kingdom will be ca&s;e out into outer darkne&s;s, and heaten with many &s;tripes. "For to whom much is given, of them &s;hall much be required."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="024390_0016_0FC704E5E5CF3EB8">
But it &s;hould al&s;o be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, that children who belong to the church, have &s;pecial encouragement to come to Chri&s;t for the ble&s;&s;ings of grace, to &s;eek their father's God, and devote them&s;elves to him. Special encouragements are propo&s;ed to early &s;eeking&mdash;"They who &s;eek me early &s;hall find me." The children of the covenant may plead this their relation to God, in their prayers to him, for his converting grace. "Turn thou me and I &s;hall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God." And there are many promi&s;es in the word of God, which expre&s;s his gracious purpo&s;e of &s;hewing &s;pecial favor and mercy to &s;uch children as are in covenant with him: that he will give them a new heart: that he will circumci&s;e their hearts to love him: that he will pour his &s;pirit and ble&s;&s;ing upon them. The&s;e promi&s;es give you great rea&s;on to hope, that your &s;eeking the Lord will not be in vain&mdash;"He hath not &s;aid to the &s;eed of Jacob, the children of the covenant, &s;eek ye me in vain." And though the&s;e promi&s;es do not make it certain that all &s;uch children &s;hall have their hearts inclined to love and &s;erve God, yet the&s;e promi&s;es make it certain, that God will be&s;tow his &s;pecial, converting, &s;anc|tifying grace on the children of the church. And as you are of that number, you have &s;pecial rea&s;on to hope and &s;eek for it.</P>
<P>Should not this encourage your hopes, and enliven your endeavors, in &s;eeking &s;uch great and nece&s;&s;ary ble&s;&s;ings when come &s;o near to you? God forbid, that any of you &s;hould

mi&s;s of obtaining &s;alvation, after his promi&s;e has brought it home to your hou&s;e. I know not how to expre&s;s my love and concern for you better than in the words of king David to his beloved &s;on&mdash;"My &s;on, know thou the God of thy father, and &s;erve him with a perfect heart, and willing mind; for the Lord &s;earcheth all hearts, and under&s;tandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou &s;eek him he will be &s;ound of thee, but if thou for&s;ake him, he will ca&s;t thee off forever."</P>
<P>I have a few things more to mention before I fini&s;h this head.</P>
<P>Your being children of the kingdom of heaven is a con&s;ideration which &s;hould move you to take care not to keep company with &s;uch as are wicked&punc; For what communion hath light with darkne&s;s&mdash;what fellow&s;hip can the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t have with the children of the wicked one? Have no fellow&s;hip with the works of darkne&s;s, nor be partakers with other mens &s;ins; but rather reprove them, and &s;o keep your&s;elves pure. Be companions of tho&s;e who fear God. "He that walketh with the wi&s;e &s;hall be wi&s;e, but a companion of fools &s;hall be de&s;troyed." Again,</P>
<P>Remember that you are under the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the church. And always receive in&s;truction and admonition from mini&s;ters, from parents, and other chri&s;tian friends, with thankfulne&s;s and due re&s;pect. Have an obedient ear for good coun&s;els and reproofs, and make the be&s;t improvement of them. Further,</P>
<P>Attend diligently upon tho&s;e ordinances
<PB N="18" REF="024390_0018_0FC704EEE7AAEC28">
which Chri&s;t has given to the church, for the &s;piritual benefit of its members particularly, &s;tudy the word of God which is a &s;pecial pri|vilege committed to the church, that you may, as was &s;aid of Timothy, know the &s;crip|tures from your childhood. They are able to make you wi&s;e to &s;alvation. Attend the wor|&s;hip and means of in&s;truction in the hou&s;e of God whenever you can, and endeavor to get good by them. And though children are not to come to the Lord's table till they appear to be, in a mea&s;ure, capable and di&s;po&s;ed to do this in a pious remembrance of Chri&s;t, agreeably to the nature and de&s;ign of <HI>this holy ordinance;</HI> yet they &s;hould labor after &s;uch at|tainments in Chri&s;tianity as to be prepared to come. And as &s;oon as evidence of this ap|pears, they &s;hould no longer delay to offer them&s;elves, and <HI>a&s;k to be admitted to the table of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And forget not in your prayers to a&s;k the ble&s;&s;ing of Chri&s;t upon the church of which you are members, and particularly upon your teachers. Yea, I would, in the words of the Apo&s;tle, be&s;eech you for the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and for the love of the &s;pirit, that you &s;trive together with me in your prayers to God for me.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ume not that your &s;tate is &s;afe, or that you are intitled to the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the king|dom of glory, merely becau&s;e you are children of the kingdom of heaven as outwardly ad|mini&s;tered upon earth. "Think not to &s;ay with your&s;elves, we have Abraham to our
<PB N="19" REF="024390_0019_0FC704F06A699EC8">
father"&mdash;This will not avail if we have not the faith, and walk not in the &s;teps of Abra|ham, and are not, as he was, "the friends of God." Not every one who &s;aith Lord, Lord, &s;hall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will our father who is in heaven. If you continue in the word of Chri&s;t, then are you his di&s;ciples indeed: and you &s;hall know the truth, and the truth &s;hall make you free and happy. But remember that many of the children of the kingdom will be ca&s;t out. To &s;uch of them as are workers of iniquity, Chri&s;t will &s;ay, I know you not, depart from me. Chri&s;t has a&s;&s;erted your right to the privileges of the church to <HI>encour|age</HI> you to <HI>come</HI> to him, but not to <HI>embolden</HI> you to <HI>for&s;ake</HI> him.</P>
<P>IV. To draw to a clo&s;e. If you come to Chri&s;t as you are invited in the go&s;pel, in obe|dience to his call, and upon the encourage|ments he holds forth, you &s;hall receive his ble&s;&s;ing. And then you will be ble&s;&s;ed in|deed. This you may remember was the <HI>fourth remark</HI> from the text which was mentioned for your notice and con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The &s;tory I have been endeavoring to im|prove for your in&s;truction, informs us, that Chri&s;t took the little children into his arms and ble&s;&s;ed them. Then might have been &s;een the fulfilment of the words of the pro|phet, &s;poken concerning him&mdash;"He &s;hall gather the lambs in his arms and carry them in his bo&s;om."</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="024390_0020_0FC704F1E38D49B0">
Happy children! you will &s;ay, whom Chri&s;t held in his arms and ble&s;&s;ed. Yea rather, I would &s;ay, happy are you, if you hear his voice to day, when he &s;peaks to you from heaven, inviting you to him. For ble&s;&s;|ed are they who have not &s;een him, and yet believe. Ble&s;&s;ed are they who hear his word and keep it.</P>
<P>I am not able to repre&s;ent the number and excellency of the ble&s;&s;ings, he will then be&s;tow upon you. He will ble&s;s you, by giving him|&s;elf and his un&s;earchable riches to you. He will ble&s;s you with the pardon of all your &s;ins, and a right to all the privileges of the chil|dren of God. He will ble&s;s you, in adorning your &s;ouls with the robes of a perfect righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and with the beauties of holine&s;s. He will ble&s;s to you all your ble&s;&s;ings, and all your troubles. What &s;hall I &s;ay more? He will ble&s;s you by giving you grace, and glory, and all good things.</P>
<P>Chu&s;e you then this day, my dear children, the glorious redeemer for your Lord and Sa|viour. Give him you whole hearts. Come to him. Take his yoke upon you and learn of him, for he is meek and lowly in heart: then you &s;hall find re&s;t to your &s;ouls. He will be your never failing friend till you die, and then he will come and carry you up to heaven, where you will be happy forever.</P>
<P>The grace of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Gho&s;t be with you.</P>

<HEAD>THE STORY OF JOSEPH.</HEAD>
<P>IN London there lived a poor ignorant man, named <HI>Jo&s;eph.</HI> It was his employment to go on errands and carry parcels. One day as he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treets, his attention being excited by mu&s;ic, from a neighboring place of wor&s;hip, he drew near and entered.</P>
<P>It was Dr. Calamy's church. The text was, "this is a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, of whom I am chief."</P>
<P>From this pa&s;&s;age the Dr. preached in the cleare&s;t manner, the ancient apo&s;tolic go&s;pel.</P>
<P>While the gay and polite audience admir|ed more the <HI>ingenuity,</HI> than the <HI>piety</HI> of the preacher, poor Jo&s;eph, in tattered clothing, fixed his eyes on the Dr. and li&s;tened with eagerne&s;s and wonder. After &s;ervice, as he went homeward, he often &s;aid to him&s;elf "Jo&s;eph never heard this before: Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners,
<PB N="22" REF="024390_0023_0FC70501B9AA40B8">
like Jo&s;eph; and this is a true and faithful &s;aying."</P>
<P>Not many days after be was taken &s;ick, with a fever, and often repeated "Jo&s;eph is the chief of &s;inners! Jo&s;eph is the chief of &s;inners! But Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, and Jo&s;eph loves him for this." Some pious per&s;ons a&s;ked him how he felt in his mind. He an&s;wered, Jo&s;eph has nothing to &s;ay for him&s;elf, only that he is the chief of &s;inners, and as Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the world to &s;ave &s;uch, why may not Jo&s;eph, after all, be &s;aved? A gentleman having found out where Jo&s;eph heard the words, upon which he dwelt with &s;o much con&s;tancy and delight, went and informed Dr. Calamy.</P>
<P>The Dr. readily ha&s;tened to &s;ee Jo&s;eph, but found him extremely feeble and low. The in&s;tant the Dr. &s;poke, he knew his voice, and exclaimed with a trembling tone, "Oh &s;ir, you are the friend of the Lord Je&s;us whom I heard the other day &s;peak &s;o well of him, and I love you for what you then &s;aid. Jo&s;eph is the chief of &s;inners, Je&s;us Chri&s;t has come to &s;ave &s;uch, and why not poor Jo&s;eph? Oh, pray to that Je&s;us for me, tell him that Jo&s;eph thinks he loves him, for coming to &s;ave &s;uch &s;inners as he is." The Dr. prayed. Jo&s;eph very affectionately thanked him. Then reaching his hand under his pillow, drew from thence an old rag, in which were tied five guineas.</P>
<P>He thus addre&s;&s;ed the Dr. looking earne&s;t|ly at him, "Jo&s;eph laid up this to keep him
<PB N="23" REF="024390_0024_0FC70503B5CF6400">
in his old age. But Jo&s;eph will never &s;ee old age. Take it and divide it among the poor friends of the Lord Je&s;us, and tell them Jo|&s;eph gave it them for his &s;ake, who came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, of whom he is the chief." Having &s;aid this, he in&s;tantly expir|ed; leaving the world a <HI>memorable proof</HI> of the <HI>efficacy</HI> of the chri&s;tian religion, and a <HI>u&s;e|ful le&s;&s;on</HI> of <HI>humility,</HI> of <HI>love</HI> to the Saviour of men, and of <HI>charity</HI> to his <HI>poor.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. Calamy left this tender &s;cene, not how|ever till he had &s;hed many tears over poor Jo&s;eph. He had, in &s;o artle&s;s a manner, di&s;|covered his &s;incere <HI>love</HI> to the Lord Je&s;us, his <HI>hope</HI> in his <HI>mercy,</HI> and his unaffected <HI>kindne&s;s</HI> and <HI>charity</HI> to his poor friends, as <HI>quite</HI> over|came, and <HI>melted</HI> the Doctor's <HI>heart.</HI></P>
<P>He u&s;ed, often, to relate this &s;tory, as one of the mo&s;t <HI>affecting occurrences</HI> of his life.</P>
