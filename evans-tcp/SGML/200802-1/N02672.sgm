<HEAD>A MODEST ENQUIRY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is no Science, the Stu|dy of which is more u&s;eful and commendable than the Knowledge of the true Intere&s;t of one's Coun|try; and perhaps there is no Kind of Learning more ab&s;tru&s;e and intricate, more difficult to acquire in any Degree of Perfection than This, and therefore none more generally neglected. Hence it is, that we every Day find Men in Conver|&s;ation contending warmly on &s;ome Point in Politicks, which, altho' it may nearly concern them both, neither of them un|der&s;tand any more than they do each other.</P>
<P>Thus much by way of Apology for this pre&s;ent <HI>Enquiry into the Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity of a Paper Currency.</HI> And if any Thing I &s;hall &s;ay, may be a Means of fixing a Subject that is now the chief
<PB N="4" REF="003165_0003_0ff085dde6327cf8">
Concern of my Countrymen, in a clearer Light, I &s;hall have the Satisfaction of thinking my Time and Pains well em|ployed.</P>
<P>To proceed, then,</P>
<P><HI>There is a certain proportionate Quan|tity of Money requi&s;ite to carry on the Trade of a Country freely and currently; More than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hich would be of no Advantage in Trade, and Le&s;s, if much le&s;s, exceedingly detri|mental to it.</HI></P>
<P>This leads us to the following general Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>A great Want of Money in any Trading Country, occa&s;ions Intere&s;t to be at at a very high Rate.</HI> And here it may be ob&s;erved, that it is impo&s;&s;ible by any Laws to re&s;train Men from giving and receiving exorbitant Intere&s;t, where Mo|ney is &s;uitably &s;carce: For he that wants Money will find out Ways to give 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> when he cannot have it for le&s;s, al|tho' the Law forbids to take more than 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Now the Intere&s;t of Money being high is prejudicial to a Country &s;everal Ways: It makes Land bear a low Price, becau&s;e few Men will lay out their Money in Land, when they can make a much greater Profit by lending it out
<PB N="5" REF="003165_0004_0ff085e2ef5a92e8">
upon Intere&s;t: And much le&s;s will Men be inclined to venture their Money at Sea, when they can, without Ri&s;que or Hazard, have a great and certain Profit by keeping it at home; thus Trade is di&s;couraged. And if in two Neigbouring Countries the Traders of one, by Rea&s;on of a greater Plenty of Money, can bor|row it to trade with at a lower Rate than the Traders of the other, they will infal|libly have the Advantage, and get the greate&s;t Part of that Trade into their own Hands; For he that trades with Money he hath borrowed at 8 or 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> cannot hold Market with him that bor|rows his Money at 6 or 4. &mdash; On the contrary, <HI>A plentiful Currency will occa&s;ion Intere&s;t to be low:</HI> And this will be an Inducement to many to lay out their Money in Lands, rather than put it out to U&s;e, by which means Land will begin to ri&s;e in Value and bear a better Price: And at the &s;ame Time it will tend to enliven Trade exceedingly, becau&s;e Peo|ple will find more Profit in employing their Money that Way than in U&s;ury; and many that under&s;tand Bu&s;ine&s;s very well, but have not a Stock &s;ufficient of their own, will be encouraged to borrow
<PB N="6" REF="003165_0005_0ff085e5db83b768">
Money to trade with, when they can have it a moderate Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Want of Money in a Country reduces the Price of that Part of its Pro|duce which is u&s;ed in Trade:</HI> Becau&s;e Trade being di&s;couraged by it as above, there is a much le&s;s Demand for that Produce. And this is another Rea&s;on why Land in &s;uch a Ca&s;e will be low, e&s;pecially where the Staple Commodity of the Country is the immediate Produce of the Land, be|cau&s;e that Produce being low, fewer Peo|ple find an Advantage in Husbandry, or the Improvement of Land. &mdash; On the contrary, <HI>A Plentiful Currency will occa&s;ion the Trading Produce to bear a good Price:</HI> Becau&s;e Trade being encouraged and ad|vanced by it, there will be a much great|er Demand for that Produce; which will be a great Encouragement of Husbandry and Tillage, and con&s;equently make Land more valuable, for that many Peo|ple would apply them&s;elves to Husban|dry, who probably might otherwi&s;e have &s;ought &s;ome more profitable Employ|ment.</P>
<P>As we have already experienced how much the Increa&s;e of our Currency by what Paper Money has been made, has
<PB N="7" REF="003165_0006_0ff085e978a18b18">
encouraged our Trade; particularly to in|&s;tance only in one Article, <HI>Ship-Building</HI>; it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve under this Head, what a great Advantage it mu&s;t be to us as a Trading Country, that has Work|men and all the Materials proper for that Bu&s;ine&s;s within it&s;elf, to have <HI>Ship-Building</HI> as much as po&s;&s;ible advanced: For every Ship that is built here for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, gains the Province her clear Value in Gold and Silver, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have been &s;ent Home for Re|turns in her Stead; and likewi&s;e, every Ship built in and belonging to the Pro|vince, not only &s;aves the Province her fir&s;t Co&s;t, but all the Freight, Wages and Provi&s;ions &s;he ever makes or requires as long as &s;he la&s;ts; provided Care is taken to make This her <HI>Pay Port,</HI> and that &s;he always takes Provi&s;ions with her for the whole Voyage, which may ea&s;ily be done. And how con&s;iderable an Article this is yearly in our Favour, every one, the lea&s;t acquainted with mercantile Affairs, mu&s;t needs be &s;en&s;ible; for if we could not Build our &s;elves, we mu&s;t either pur|cha&s;e &s;o many Ve&s;&s;els as we want from other Countries, or el&s;e Hire them to carry our Produce to Market, which
<PB N="8" REF="003165_0007_0ff085ede18f7610">
would be more expen&s;ive than Purcha&s;ing; and on many other Accounts exceedingly to our Lo&s;s. Now as Trade in general will decline where there is not a plentiful Currency, &s;o <HI>Ship-Building</HI> mu&s;t certainly of Con&s;equence decline where Trade is declining.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Want of Money in a Country di&s;courages Labouring and Handicrafts Men (which are the chief Strength and Support of a People) from coming to &s;ettle in it, and induces many that were &s;ettled to leave the Country, and &s;eek Entertainment and Em|ployment in othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Places, where they can be better paid.</HI> For what can be more di&s;|heartning to an indu&s;trious labouring Man, than this, that after he hath earned his Bread with the Sweat of his Brows, he mu&s;t &s;pend as much Time, and have near as much Fatigue in getting it, as he had to earn it. <HI>And nothing makes more bad Payma&s;ters than a general Scarcity of Money.</HI> And here again is a Third Rea&s;on for Land's bearing a low Price in &s;uch a Country, becau&s;e Land always increa&s;es in Value in Proportion with the Increa&s;e of the People &s;ettling on it, there being &s;o many more Buyers; and its Value will infallibly be dimini&s;hed, if the Number
<PB N="9" REF="003165_0008_0ff085f1f4e686b8">
of its Inhabitants dimini&s;h. &mdash; On the contrary, <HI>A Plentiful Currency will encou|rage great Numbers of Labouring and Handi|crafts Men to come and Settle in the Country,</HI> by the &s;ame Rea&s;on that a Want of it will di&s;courage and drive them out. Now the more Inhabitants, the greater De|mand for Land (as is &s;aid above) upon which it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ri&s;e in Value, and bear a better Price. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the Value of Hou&s;e-Rent, which will be advanced for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons; and by the Increa&s;e of Trade and Riches People will be enabled to pay greater Rents. Now the Value of Hou&s;e-Rent ri&s;ing, and Intere&s;t becoming low, many that in a Scarcity of Money prac|ti&s;ed U&s;ury, will probably be more in|clined to Building; which will likewi&s;e &s;en&s;ibly enliven Bu&s;ine&s;s in any Place; it being an Advantage not only to <HI>Brick|makers, Bricklayers, Ma&s;ons, Carpenters, Joiners, Glaziers,</HI> and &s;everal other Trades immediately employ'd by Building, but likewi&s;e to <HI>Farmers, Brewers, Bakers, Taylors, Shoemakers, Shop-keepers,</HI> and in &s;hort to every one that they lay their Money out with.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003165_0009_0ff085f3e7e75cd0">Fourthly, <HI>Want of Money in &s;uch a Coun|try as ours, occa&s;ions a greater Con&s;umption of</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>and</HI> European <HI>Goods, in Pro|portion to the Number of the People, than there would otherwi&s;e be.</HI> Becau&s;e Mer|chants and Traders, by whom abundance of Artificers and labouring Men are em|ployed, finding their other Affairs require what Money they can get into their hands, oblige tho&s;e who work for them to take one half, or perhaps two thirds Goods in Pay. By this Means a greater Quantity of Goods are di&s;po&s;ed of, and to a greater Value; becau&s;e Working Men and their Families ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thereby induced to be more profu&s;e and extravagant in fine Apparel and the like, than they would be if they were obliged to pay ready Money for &s;uch Things after they had earn'd and received it, or if &s;uch Goods were not impo&s;ed upon them, of which they can make no other U&s;e: For &s;uch People cannot &s;end the Goods they are paid with to a Foreign Market, without lo&s;ing con&s;iderably by having them &s;old for le&s;s than they &s;tand 'em in here; neither can they ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;e of them at Home, becau&s;e their Neigh|bours are generally &s;upplied in the &s;ame Manner; But how unrea&s;onable would it
<PB N="11" REF="003165_0010_0ff085f5b7996600">
be, if &s;ome of tho&s;e very Men who <HI>have been a Means</HI> of thus forcing People into unnece&s;&s;ary Expence, &s;hould be the fir&s;t and mo&s;t earne&s;t in accu&s;ing them of <HI>Pride and Prodigality.</HI> Now tho' this extraor|dinary Con&s;umption of Foreign Com|modities may be a Profit to particular Men, yet the Country in general grows poorer by it apace. &mdash; On the con|trary, As <HI>A plentiful Currency will occa&s;ion a le&s;s Con&s;umption of</HI> European <HI>Goods, in Proportion to the Number of the People,</HI> &s;o it will be a means of making the Balance of our Trade more equal than it now is, if it does not give it in our Favour; be|cau&s;e our own Produce will be encoura|ged at the &s;ame Time. And it is to be ob&s;erved, that tho' le&s;s Foreign Commo|dities are con&s;umed in Proportion to the Number of People, yet this will be no Di&s;advantage to the Merchant, becau&s;e the Number of People increa&s;ing, will occa&s;ion an increa&s;ing Demand of more Foreign Goods in the Whole.</P>
<P>Thus we have &s;een &s;ome of the many heavy Di&s;advantages a Country (e&s;pe|cially &s;uch a Country as ours) mu&s;t la|bour under, when it has not a &s;ufficient Stock of running Ca&s;h to manage its
<PB N="12" REF="003165_0011_0ff085fd03d57200">
Trade currently. And we have likewi&s;e &s;een &s;ome of the Advantages which ac|crue from having Money &s;ufficient, or a Plentiful Currency.</P>
<P>The foregoing Paragraphs being well con&s;idered, we &s;hall naturally be led to draw the following Conclu&s;ions with Re|gard to what Per&s;ons will probably be for or again&s;t Emitting a large Additional Sum of Paper Bills in this Province.</P>
<P N="1">1. Since Men will always be power|fully influenced in their Opinions and Actions by what appears to be their par|ticular Intere&s;t: Therefore all tho&s;e, who wanting Courage to venture in Trade, now practi&s;e Lending Money on Security for exorbitant Intere&s;t, which in a Scarcity of Money will be done notwith&s;tanding the Law, I &s;ay all &s;uch will probably be again&s;t a large Addition to our pre&s;ent Stock of Paper-Money; becau&s;e a plen|tiful Currency will lower Intere&s;t, and make it common to lend on le&s;s Security.</P>
<P N="2">2. All tho&s;e who are Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of large Sums of Money, and are di&s;po&s;ed to pur|cha&s;e Land, which is attended with a great and &s;ure Advantage in a growing Country as this is; I &s;ay, the Intere&s;t of all &s;uch Men will encline them to oppo&s;e a large
<PB N="13" REF="003165_0012_0ff085ff2523c060">
Addition to our Money. Becau&s;e their Wealth is now continually increa&s;ing by the large Intere&s;t they receive, which will enable them (if they can keep Land from ri&s;ing) to purcha&s;e More &s;ome time hence than they can at pre&s;ent; and in the mean time all Trade being di&s;cour|aged, not only tho&s;e who borrow of them, but the Common People in general will be impoveri&s;hed, and con&s;equently obli|ged to &s;ell More Land for le&s;s Money than they will do at pre&s;ent. And yet, after &s;uch Men are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of as much Land as they can purcha&s;e, it will then be their Intere&s;t to have Money made Plentiful, becau&s;e that will immediately make Land ri&s;e in Value in <HI>their</HI> Hands. Now it ought not to be wonder'd at, if Peo|ple from the Knowledge of a Man's In|tere&s;t do &s;ometimes make a true Gue&s;s at his De&s;igns; for, <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> they &s;ay, <HI>will not Lie.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Lawyers, and others concerned in Court Bu&s;ine&s;s, will probably many of them be again&s;t a plentiful Currency; be|cau&s;e People in that Ca&s;e will have le&s;s Occa&s;ion to run in Debt, and con&s;equently le&s;s Occa&s;ion to go to Law and Sue one another for their Debts. Tho' I know
<PB N="14" REF="003165_0013_0ff08601458ee9a0">
&s;ome even among the&s;e Gentlemen, that regard the Publick Good before their own apparent private Intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. All tho&s;e who are any way Depen|dants on &s;uch Per&s;ons as are above men|tioned, whether as holding Offices, as Tenants, or as Debtors, mu&s;t at lea&s;t <HI>ap|pear</HI> to be again&s;t a large Addition; be|cau&s;e if they do not, they mu&s;t &s;en&s;ibly feel their pre&s;ent Intere&s;t hurt. And be|&s;ides the&s;e, there are, doubtle&s;s, many well-meaning Gentlemen and Others, who, without any immediate private In|tere&s;t of their own in View, are again&s;t making &s;uch an Addition, thro' an Opi|nion they may have of the Hone&s;ty and &s;ound Judgment of &s;ome of their Friends that oppo&s;e it, (perhaps for the Ends a|fore&s;aid) without having given it any thorough Con&s;iderarion them&s;elves. And thus it is no Wonder if there is a <HI>power|ful</HI> Party on that Side.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, Tho&s;e who are Lovers of Trade, and delight to &s;ee Ma|nufactures encouraged, will be for having a large Addition to our Currency: For they very well know, that People will have little Heart to advance Money in Trade, when what they can get is &s;carce
<PB N="15" REF="003165_0014_0ff0860659891fe8">
&s;ufficient to purcha&s;e Nece&s;&s;aries, and &s;up|ply their Families with Provi&s;ion. Much le&s;s will they lay it out in advancing new Manufactures; nor is it po&s;&s;ible new Ma|nufactures &s;hould turn to any Account, where there is not Money to pay the Workmen, who are di&s;couraged by being paid in Goods, becau&s;e it is a great Di&s;|advantage to them.</P>
<P>Again, Tho&s;e who are truly for the Proprietor's Intere&s;t (and have no &s;e|parate Views of their own that are pre|dominant) will be heartily for a large Addition: Becau&s;e, as I have &s;hewn a|bove, Plenty of Money will for &s;everal Rea&s;ons make Land ri&s;e in Value exceed|ingly: And I appeal to tho&s;e immedi|ately concerned for the Proprietor in the Sale of his Lands, whether Land has not ri&s;en very much &s;ince the fir&s;t Emi&s;&s;ion of what Paper Currency we now have, and even by its Means. Now we all know the Proprietary has great Quanti|ties to &s;ell.</P>
<P>And &s;ince a Plentiful Currency will be &s;o great a Cau&s;e of advancing this Pro|vince in Trade and Riches, and increa&s;ing the Number of its People; which, tho' it will not &s;en&s;ibly le&s;&s;en the Inhabitants of
<PB N="16" REF="003165_0015_0ff08609613ce170">
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> will occa&s;ion a much grea|ter Vent and Demand for their Commo|dities here; and allowing that the Crown is the more powerful for its Subjects in|crea&s;ing in Wealth and Number, I can|not think it the Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> to oppo&s;e us in making as great a Sum of Paper Money here, as we, who are the be&s;t Judges of our own Nece&s;&s;ities, find convenient. And if I were not &s;en&s;ible that the Gentlemen of Trade in <HI>England,</HI> to whom we have already parted with our Silver and Gold, are mi&s;informed of our Circum&s;tances, and therefore endea|vour to have our Currency &s;tinted to what it now is, I &s;hould think the Government at Home had &s;ome Rea&s;ons for di&s;cour|aging and impoveri&s;hing this Province, which we are not acquainted with.</P>
<P>It remains now that we enquire, <HI>Whe|ther a large Addition to our Paper Curren|cy will not make it &s;ink in Value very much</HI>; And here it will be requi&s;ite that we fir&s;t form ju&s;t Notions of the Nature and Va|lue of Money in general.</P>
<P>As Providence has &s;o ordered it, that not only different Countries, but even different Parts of the &s;ame Country, have their peculiar mo&s;t &s;uitable Productions;
<PB N="17" REF="003165_0016_0ff0860c10dd2f38">
and likewi&s;e that different Men have Ge|nius's adapted to Variety of different Arts and Manufactures, Therefore <HI>Commerce,</HI> or the Exchange of one Commodity or Manufacture for another, is highly con|venient and beneficial to Mankind. As for In&s;tance, <HI>A</HI> may be skilful in the Art of making Cloth, and <HI>B</HI> under&s;tand the rai&s;ing of Corn; <HI>A</HI> wants Corn, and <HI>B</HI> Cloth; upon which they make an Exchange with each other for as much as each has Occa&s;ion, to the mutual Advan|tage and Satisfaction of both.</P>
<P>But as it would be very tedious, if there were no other Way of general Deal|ing, but by an immediate Exchange of Commodities; becau&s;e a Man that had Corn to di&s;po&s;e of, and wanted Cloth for it, might perhaps in his Search for a Chapman to deal with, meet with twen|ty People that had Cloth to di&s;po&s;e of, but wanted no Corn; and with twenty others that wanted his Corn, but had no Cloth to &s;uit him with. To remedy &s;uch Inconveniences, and facilitate Ex|change, Men have invented MONEY, properly called a <HI>Medium of Exchange,</HI> be|cau&s;e through or by its Means Labour is exchanged for Labour, or one Commo|dity
<PB N="18" REF="003165_0017_0ff0860e860e81b0">
for another. And whatever particu|lar Thing Men have agreed to make this Medium of, whether Gold, Silver, Cop|per, or Tobacco; it is, to tho&s;e who po&s;|&s;e&s;s it (if they want any Thing) that ve|ry Thing which they want, becau&s;e it will immediately procure it for them. It is Cloth to him that wants Cloth, and Corn to tho&s;e that want Corn; and &s;o of all other Nece&s;&s;aries, it <HI>is</HI> what&s;oever it will procure. Thus he who had Corn to di&s;po&s;e of, and wanted to purcha&s;e Cloth with it, might &s;ell his Corn for its Value in this general Medium, to one who wanted Corn but had no Cloth; and with this Medium he might purcha&s;e Cloth of him that wanted no Corn, but perhaps &s;ome other Thing, as Iron it may be, which this Medium will immediately pro|cure, and &s;o he may be &s;aid to have ex|changed his Cloth for Iron; and thus the general Exchange is &s;oon performed, to the Satisfaction of all Parties, with abun|dance of Facility.</P>
<P>For many Ages, tho&s;e Parts of the World which are engaged in Commerce, have fixed upon Gold and Silver as the chief and mo&s;t proper Materials for this Medium; they being in them&s;elves va|luable
<PB N="19" REF="003165_0018_0ff086131115a458">
Metals for their Finene&s;s, Beauty, and Scarcity. By the&s;e, particularly by Silver, it has been u&s;ual to value all Things el&s;e: But as Silver it &s;elf is of no certain permanent Value, being worth more or le&s;s according to its Scarcity or Plenty, therefore it &s;eems requi&s;ite to fix upon Something el&s;e, more proper to be made a <HI>Mea&s;ure of Values,</HI> and this I take to be <HI>Labour.</HI></P>
<P>By Labour may the Value of Silver be mea&s;ured as well as other Things. As, Suppo&s;e one Man employed to rai&s;e Corn, while another is digging and refining Sil|ver; at the Year's End, or at any other Period of Time, the compleat Produce of Corn, and that of Silver, are the natural Price of each other; and if one be twen|ty Bu&s;hels, and the other twenty Ounces, then an Ounce of that Silver is worth the Labour of rai&s;ing a Bu&s;hel of that Corn. Now if by the Di&s;covery of &s;ome near|er, more ea&s;y or plentiful Mines, a Man may get Forty Ounces of Silver as ea&s;ily as formerly he did Twenty, and the &s;ame Labour is &s;till required to rai&s;e Twenty Bu&s;hels of Corn, then Two Ounces of Silver will be worth no more than the &s;ame Labour of rai&s;ing One Bu&s;hel of
<PB N="20" REF="003165_0019_0ff086157057afc8">
Corn, and that Bu&s;hel of Corn will be as cheap at two Ounces, as it was before at one; <HI>caeteris paribus.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Riches of a Country are to be valued by the Quantity of Labour its Inhabitants are able to purcha&s;e, and not by the Quantity of Silver and Gold they po&s;&s;e&s;s; which will purcha&s;e more or le&s;s Labour, and therefore is more or le&s;s va|luable, as is &s;aid before, according to its Scarcity or Plenty. As tho&s;e Metals have grown much more plentiful in <HI>Eu|rope</HI> &s;ince the Di&s;covery of <HI>America,</HI> &s;o they have &s;unk in Value exceedingly; for, to in&s;tance in <HI>England,</HI> formerly one Penny of Silver was worth a Days La|bour, but now it is hardly worth the &s;ixth Part of a Days Labour; becau&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot le&s;s than Six-pence will purcha&s;e the La|bour of a Man for a Day in any Part of that Kingdom; which is wholly to be attributed to the much greater Plenty of Money now in <HI>England</HI> than formerly. And yet perhaps <HI>England</HI> is in Effect no richer now than at that Time; becau&s;e as much Labour might be purchas'd, or Work got done of almo&s;t any kind, for 100 <HI>l.</HI> then, as will now require or is now worth 600 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="003165_0020_0ff086170d89ba90">In the next Place let us con&s;ider the Nature of <HI>Banks</HI> emitting <HI>Bills of Credit,</HI> as they are at this Time u&s;ed in <HI>Ham|burgh, Am&s;terdam, London</HI> and <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e Places being Seats of va&s;t Trade, and the Payment of great Sums being for that Rea&s;on frequent, <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> are found very convenient in Bu&s;ine&s;s; becau&s;e a great Sum is more ea&s;ily counted in Them, lighter in Carriage, concealed in le&s;s Room, and therefore &s;afer in Tra|velling or Laying up, and on many other Accounts they are very much valued. The Banks are the general Ca&s;hiers of all Gentlemen, Merchants and great Traders in and about tho&s;e Cities; there they de|po&s;ite their Money, and may take out Bills to the Value, for which they can be certain to have Money again at the Bank at any Time: This gives the Bills a Credit; &s;o that in <HI>England</HI> they are ne|ver le&s;s valuable than Money, and in <HI>Ve|nice</HI> and <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> they are generally worth more. And the Bankers always re&s;erving Money in hand to an&s;wer more than the common Run of Demands (and &s;ome People con&s;tantly putting in while others are taking out) are able be&s;ides to lend large Sums, on good Security, to
<PB N="22" REF="003165_0021_0ff0861ab855e7d0">
the Government or others, for a rea&s;on|able Intere&s;t, by which they are paid for their Care and Trouble; and the Money which otherwi&s;e would have lain dead in their Hands, is made to circulate again thereby among the People: And thus the Running Ca&s;h of the Nation is as it were doubled; for all great Payments being made in Bills, Money in lower Trade becomes much more plentiful: And this is an exceeding great Advantage to a Trading Country, that is not over-&s;tock'd with Gold and Silver.</P>
<P>As tho&s;e who take Bills out of the Banks in <HI>Europe,</HI> put in Money for Se|curity; &s;o here, and in &s;ome of the neigh|bouring Provinces, we engage our Land. Which of the&s;e Methods will mo&s;t effec|tually &s;ecure the Bills from actually &s;ink|ing in Value, comes next to be con&s;i|dered.</P>
<P>Trade in general being nothing el&s;e but the Exchange of Labour for Labour, the Value of all Things is, as I have &s;aid before, mo&s;t ju&s;tly mea&s;ured by Labour. Now &s;uppo&s;e I put my Money into a Bank, and take out a Bill for the Value; if this Bill at the Time of my receiving it, would purcha&s;e me the Labour of one
<PB N="23" REF="003165_0022_0ff0861c51a7ca68">
hundred Men for twenty Days; but &s;ome time after will only purcha&s;e the Labour of the &s;ame Number of Men for fifteen Days; it is plain the Bill has &s;unk in Value one fourth Part. Now Silver and Gold being of no permanent Value; and as this Bill is founded on Money, and therefore to be e&s;teemed as &s;uch, it may be that the Occa&s;ion of this Fall is the increa&s;ing Plenty of Gold and Silver, by which Money is one fourth Part le&s;s va|luable than before, and therefore one fourth more is given of it for the &s;ame Quantity of Labour; and if Land is not become more plentiful by &s;ome propor|tionate Decrea&s;e of the People, one fourth Part more of Money is given for the &s;ame Quantity of Land, whereby it appears that it would have been more profitable to me to have laid that Money out in Land which I put into the Bank, than to place it there and take a Bill for it. And it is certain that the Value of Money has been continually &s;inking in <HI>England</HI> for &s;everal Ages pa&s;t, becau&s;e it has been con|tinually increa&s;ing in Quantity. But if Bills could be taken out of a Bank in <HI>Europe</HI> on a Land Security, it is probable the Value of &s;uch Bills would be more
<PB N="24" REF="003165_0023_0ff0861ed5064748">
certain and &s;teady, becau&s;e the Number of Inhabitants continue to be near the &s;ame in tho&s;e Countries from Age to Age.</P>
<P>For as Bills i&s;&s;ued upon Money Secu|rity are Money, &s;o Bills i&s;&s;ued upon Land, are in Effect <HI>Coined Land.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore (to apply the Above to our own Circum&s;tances) If Land in this Pro|vince was falling, or any way likely to fall, it would behove the Legi&s;lature mo&s;t carefully to contrive how to prevent rhe Bills i&s;&s;ued upon Land from falling with it. But as our People increa&s;e exceed|ingly, and will be further increa&s;ed, as I have before &s;hewn, by the Help of a large Addition to our Currency; and as Land in con&s;equence is continually ri&s;ing, So, in ca&s;e no Bills are emitted but what are upon Land Security, the Money-Acts in every Part punctually enforced and ex|ecuted, the Payments of Principal and Intere&s;t being duly and &s;trictly required, and the Principal <HI>bona fide</HI> &s;unk according to Law, it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch Bills &s;hould ever &s;ink below their fir&s;t Value, or below the Value of the Land on which they are founded. In &s;hort, there is &s;o little Danger of their &s;inking,
<PB N="25" REF="003165_0024_0ff086225604c7a0">
that they would certainly ri&s;e as the Land ri&s;es, if they were not emitted in a pro|per Manner for preventing it; That is, by providing in the Act <HI>That Payment may be made, either in tho&s;e Bills, or in any other Bills made current by any Act of the Legi&s;lature of this Province</HI>; and that the Intere&s;t, as it is received, may be again emitted in Di&s;charge of Publick Debts; whereby circulating it returns again into the Hands of the Borrowers, and becomes Part of their future Payments; and thus as it is likely there will not be any Diffi|culty for want of Bills to pay the Office, they are hereby kept from ri&s;ing above their fir&s;t Value: For el&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing there &s;hould be emitted upon mortgaged Land its full pre&s;ent Value in Bills; as in the Banks in <HI>Europe</HI> the full Value of the Money depo&s;ited is given out in Bills; and &s;uppo&s;ing the Office would take no|thing but the &s;ame Sum in tho&s;e Bills in Di&s;charge of the Land; as in the Banks afore&s;aid, the &s;ame Sum in their Bills mu&s;t be brought in, in order to receive out the Money: In &s;uch Ca&s;e the Bills would mo&s;t &s;urely ri&s;e in Value as the Land ri&s;es; as certainly as the Bank Bills founded on Money would fall if that Mo|ney
<PB N="26" REF="003165_0025_0ff08623e5416638">
was falling. Thus if I were to mort|gage to a Loan-Office, or Bank, a Parcel of Land now valued at 100 <HI>l.</HI> in Silver, and receive for it the like Sum in Bills, to be paid in again at the Expiration of a certain Term of Years; before which, my Land ri&s;ing in Value, becomes worth 150 <HI>l.</HI> in Silver: 'Tis plain, that if I have not the&s;e Bills in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the Of|fice will take nothing but the&s;e Bills, or el&s;e what it is now become worth in Sil|ver, in Di&s;charge of my Land; I &s;ay it appears plain, that tho&s;e Bills will now be worth 150 <HI>l.</HI> in Silver to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and if I can purcha&s;e them for le&s;s, in order to redeem my Land, I &s;hall by &s;o much be a Gainer.</P>
<P>I need not &s;ay any Thing to convince the Judicious that our Bills have not yet &s;unk, tho' there is and has been &s;ome Difference between them and Silver; be|cau&s;e it is evident that that Difference is occa&s;ioned by the Scarcity of the latter, which is now become a Merchandize, ri|&s;ing and falling, like other Commodities, as there is a greater or le&s;s Demand for it, or as it is more or le&s;s Plenty.</P>
<P>Yet farther, in order to make a true E&s;timate of the Value of Money, we mu&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="003165_0026_0ff0862adc15aab0">
di&s;tingui&s;h between Money as it is Bul|lion, which is Merchandize, and as by being coin'd it is made a Currency: For its Value as a Merchandize, and its Va|lue as a Currency, are two di&s;tinct Things; and each may po&s;&s;ibly ri&s;e and fall in &s;ome Degree independent of the other. Thus if the Quantity of Bullion increa&s;es in a Country, it will proportionably decrea&s;e in Value; but if at the &s;ame Time the Quantity of current Coin &s;hould decrea&s;e, (&s;uppo&s;ing Payments may not be made in Bullion) what Coin there is will ri&s;e in Value as a Currency, <HI>i. e.</HI> People will give more Labour in Manufactures for a certain Sum of ready Money.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Manner mu&s;t we con&s;ider a <HI>Paper Currency</HI> founded on Land; as it is Land, and as it is a Currency</P>
<P><HI>Money as Bullion, or as Land, is valua|ble by &s;o much Labour as it co&s;ts to procure that Bullion or Land.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Money, as a Currency, has an Additional Value by &s;o much Time and Labour as it &s;aves in the Exchange of Commodities.</HI></P>
<P>If, as a Currency, it &s;aves one Fourth Part of the Time and Labour of a Coun|try; it has, on that Account, one Fourth added to its original Value.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="003165_0027_0ff0862c65967b78">When there is no Money in a Coun|try, all Commerce mu&s;t be by Exchange. Now if it takes one fourth Part of the Time and Labour of a Country, to ex|change or get their Commodities exchan|ged; then, in computing their Value, that Labour of Exchanging mu&s;t be ad|ded to the Labour of manufacturing tho&s;e Commodities: But if that Time or La|bour is &s;aved by introducing Money &s;uf|ficient, then the additional Value on Ac|count of the Labour of Exchanging may be abated, and Things &s;old for only the Value of the Labour in making them; becau&s;e the People may now in the &s;ame Time make one Fourth more in Quan|tity of Manufactures than they could be|fore.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Con&s;iderations it may be gathered, that in all the Degrees between having no Money in a Country, and Mo|ney &s;ufficient for the Trade, it will ri&s;e and fall in Value as a Currency, in Pro|portion to the Decrea&s;e or Increa&s;e of its Quantity: And if there may be at &s;ome Time more than enough, the Overplus will have no Effect towards making the Currency, as a Currency, of le&s;s Value than when there was but enough; becau&s;e
<PB N="29" REF="003165_0028_0ff0862f11908178">
&s;uch Overplus will not be u&s;ed in Trade, but be &s;ome other way di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>If we enquire. <HI>How much</HI> per Cent. <HI>In|tere&s;t ought to be required upon the Loan of the&s;e Bills</HI>; we mu&s;t con&s;ider what is the Natural Standard of U&s;ury: And this appears to be, where the Security is un|doubted, at lea&s;t the Rent of &s;o much Land as the Money lent will buy: For it cannot be expected that any Man will lend his Money for le&s;s than it would fetch him in as Rent if he laid it out in Land, which is the mo&s;t &s;ecure Property in the World. But if the Security is ca|&s;ual, then a kind of En&s;urance mu&s;t be enterwoven with the &s;imple natural In|tere&s;t, which may advance the U&s;ury ve|ry con&s;cionably to any height below the Principal it &s;elf. Now among us, if the Value of Land is twenty Years Purcha&s;e, Five <HI>per Cent.</HI> is the ju&s;t Rate of Intere&s;t for Money lent on undoubted Security. Yet if Money grows &s;carce in a Country, it becomes more difficult for People to make punctual Payments of what they borrow, Money being hard to be rai&s;ed; likewi&s;e Trade being di&s;couraged, and Bu&s;ine&s;s impeded for want of a Currency, abundance of People mu&s;t be in declining
<PB N="30" REF="003165_0029_0ff07db78bd816d8">
Circum&s;tances, and by the&s;e Means Secu|rity is more precarious than where Mo|ney is plenty. On &s;uch Accounts it is no wonder if People ask a greater Intere&s;t for their Money than the natural Intere&s;t; and what is above is to be look'd upon as a kind of <HI>Praemium</HI> for the En&s;urance of tho&s;e Uncertainties, as they are greater or le&s;s. Thus we always &s;ee, that where Money is &s;carce, Intere&s;t is high, and low where it is plenty. Now it is certainly the Advantage of a Country to make In|tere&s;t as low as po&s;&s;ible, as I have alrea|dy &s;hewn; and this can be done no other way than by making Money plentiful. And &s;ince, in Emitting Paper Money a|mong us, the Office has the be&s;t of Secu|rity, the Titles to the Land being all skilfully and &s;trictly examined and a&s;cer|tained; and as it is only permitting the People by Law to coin their own Land, which co&s;ts the Government nothing, the Intere&s;t being more than enough to pay the Charges of Printing, Officers Fees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I cannot &s;ee any good Rea&s;on why Four <HI>per Cent.</HI> to the Loan-Office &s;hould not be thought fully &s;ufficient. As a low In|tere&s;t may incline more to take Money out, it will become more plentiful in
<PB N="31" REF="003165_0030_0ff0863933033828">
Trade; and this may bring down the com|mon U&s;ury, in which Security is more dubious, to the Pitch it is determined at by Law.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be objected, <HI>That Emitting It at &s;o low an Intere&s;t, and on &s;uch ea&s;y Terms, will occa&s;ion more to be taken out than the Trade of the Country really requires&punc;</HI> It may be an&s;wered, That, as has already been &s;hewn, there can never be &s;o much of it emitted as to make it fall below the Land it is founded on; becau&s;e no Man in his Sen&s;es will mortgage his E&s;tate for what is of no more Value to him than That he has mortgaged, e&s;pecially if the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of what he receives is more precarious than of what he mortgages, as that of Paper Money is when compared to Land: And if it &s;hould ever become &s;o plenty by in|di&s;creet Per&s;ons continuing to take out a large Overplus, above what is nece&s;&s;ary in Trade, &s;o as to make People imagine it would become by that Means of le&s;s Value than their mortgaged Lands, they would immediately of Cour&s;e begin to pay it in again to the Office to redeem their Land, and continue to do &s;o till there was no more left in Trade than was ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary. And thus the Proportion
<PB N="32" REF="003165_0031_0ff0863acffdd770">
would find it &s;elf, (tho' there were a Mil|lion too much in the Office to be let out) without giving any one the Trouble of Calculation.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be objected to what I have written concerning the Advantages of a large Addition to our Currency, <HI>That if the People of this Province increa&s;e, and Husbandry is more followed, we &s;hall over|&s;tock the Markets with our Produce of Flow|er,</HI> &amp;c. To this it may be an&s;wered, that we can never have too many People (nor too much Money) For when one Branch of Trade or Bu&s;ine&s;s is over&s;tocked with Hands, there are the more to &s;pare to be employed in another. So if rai&s;ing Wheat proves dull, more may (if there is Mo|ney to &s;upport and carry on new Manu|factures) proceed to the rai&s;ing and ma|nufacturing of <HI>Hemp, Silk, Iron,</HI> and ma|ny other Things the Country is very ca|pable of, for which we only want Peo|ple to work, and Money to pay them with.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole it may be ob&s;erved, That it is the highe&s;t Intere&s;t of a Tra|ding Country in general to make Money plentiful; and that it can be a Di&s;advan|tage to none that have hone&s;t De&s;igns.
<PB N="33" REF="003165_0032_0ff0863ea78bdef0">
It cannot hurt even the U&s;urers, tho' it &s;hould &s;ink what they receive as Intere&s;t; becau&s;e they will be proportionably more &s;ecure in what they lend; or they will have an Opportunity of employing their Money to greater Advantage, to them|&s;elves as well as to the Country. Neither can it hurt tho&s;e Merchants who have great Sums out-&s;tanding in Debts in the Country, and &s;eem on that Account to have the mo&s;t plau&s;ible Rea&s;on to fear it; <HI>to wit,</HI> becau&s;e a large Addition being made to our Currency, will increa&s;e the Demand of our Exporting Produce, and by that Means rai&s;e the Price of it, &s;o that they will not be able to purcha&s;e &s;o much Bread or Flower with 100 <HI>l.</HI> when they &s;hall receive it after &s;uch an Addition, as they now can, and may if there is no Addition: I &s;ay it cannot hurt even &s;uch, becau&s;e they will get in their Debts ju&s;t in exact Proportion &s;o much the ea&s;ier and &s;ooner as the Money becomes plentier; and therefore, con&s;idering the Intere&s;t and Trouble &s;aved, they will not be Lo&s;ers; becau&s;e it only &s;inks in Value as a Cur|rency, proportionally as it becomes more plenty. It cannot hurt the Intere&s;t of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as has been &s;hewn; and it
<PB N="34" REF="003165_0033_0ff0864283c42c20">
will greatly advance the Intere&s;t of the Proprietor. It will be an Advantage to every indu&s;trious Trade&s;man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e his Bu&s;ine&s;s will be carried on more free|ly, and Trade be univer&s;ally enlivened by it. And as more Bu&s;ine&s;s in all Manu|factures will be done, by &s;o much as the Labour and Time &s;pent in Exchange is &s;aved, the Country in general will grow &s;o much the richer.</P>
<P>It is nothing to the Purpo&s;e to object the wretched Fall of the Bills in <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> and <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> unle&s;s it might be made evident that their Currency was emitted with the &s;ame Prudence, and on &s;uch good Security as ours is; and it cer|tainly was not.</P>
<P>As this E&s;&s;ay is wrote and publi&s;hed in Ha&s;te, and the Subject in it &s;elf intri|cate, I hope I &s;hall be cen&s;ured with Can|dour, if, for want of Time carefully to revi&s;e what I have written, in &s;ome Pla|ces I &s;hould appear to have expre&s;s'd my &s;elf too ob&s;curely, and in others am lia|ble to Objections I did not fore&s;ee.

take the Pains to &s;hew me, or the Pub|lick, where I am mi&s;taken in my Con|clu&s;ions, And as we all know there are among us &s;everal Gentlemen of acute Parts and profound Learning, who are very much again&s;t any Addition to our Money, it were to be wi&s;hed that they would fa|vour the Country with their Sentiments on this Head in Print; which, &s;upported with Truth and good Rea&s;oning, may probably be very convincing. And this is to be de&s;ired the rather, becau&s;e many People knowing the Abilities of tho&s;e Gentlemen to manage a good Cau&s;e, are apt to con&s;true their Silence in This, as an Argument of a bad One. Had any Thing of that Kind ever yet appeared, perhaps I &s;hould not have given the Pub|lick this Trouble: But as tho&s;e ingenious Gentlemen have not yet (and I doubt never will) think it worth their Concern to enlighten the Minds of their erring Countrymen in this Particular.

but, if Occa&s;ion requires, to tran&s;mit Home &s;uch clear Repre&s;entations, and mu&s;t inevitably convince our Superiors of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Integrity of our De&s;igns.</P>
