<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_TRUTH is a very precious Jewel: Ta|ken in general it is &s;o; but that which is emphatically called <HI>the Truth,</HI> is &s;o more e&s;pecially: I mean that which is revealed to a &s;inful and peri&s;hing World, with Re|&s;pect to a Way of Salvation by a Redeemer; and which is indeed no other than the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>That was therefore good Advice of the wi&s;e Man, <HI>Buy the Truth, and &s;ell it not</HI>: And that was a very excel|lent Saying of the great Apo&s;tle, <HI>We can do nothing again&s;t the Truth, but for the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed there are many who are apt to make &s;uch a Profe&s;&s;ion, who cannot do it on &s;o good Grounds as the holy Apo&s;tle did. But I remember a Saying of a very worthy Divine <NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> John Robin&s;on.</NOTE> to this Purpo&s;e,
<Q>That when &s;o|ber Per&s;ons offer to prove by the Word of God what they &s;ay and maintain, we ought, in Honour to the
<PB N="ii" REF="005439_0003_1018303ceb4024c0">
divine Oracles, to &s;hew &s;o much Regard to them, as to examine into the Truth of what they &s;o offer to confirm.</Q></P>
<P>However uncertain we may be with Re&s;pect to ma|ny Things, which we have a Call to take under Con|&s;ideration; yet I think we may be very &s;ure of this, that the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of Men, in their pre&s;ent lap&s;ed State, <HI>know but in Part, and prophe&s;y but in Part</HI>; and &s;o had need carry them&s;elves very humbly in all their E&s;&s;ays for the Ive&s;tigation and Declaration of the Truth; and that the Truth being &s;uch an invaluable Trea&s;ure, as is above expre&s;&s;ed, it ought not on any &s;lighty Grounds to be parted with, and &s;uffered to be lo&s;t. We are therefore &s;ometimes called to <HI>contend earne&s;tly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints</HI>; and to be willing rather to &s;uffer Reproaches, and other Evils, than that the Cau&s;e of Truth &s;hould &s;uffer thro' our Neglect. That is, in a good Sen&s;e, a Truth concerning all Chri&s;tians, but e|&s;pecially the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, who are <HI>&s;et for the Defence of the Go&s;pel,</HI> and made <HI>Stewards of the My&s;teries of God,</HI> viz. <HI>For this End was I born, and for this Cau&s;e came I into the World, that I &s;hould bear Wit|ne&s;s to the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>As for the following E&s;&s;ay, whatever Cen&s;ure I may fall under on the Account of it, I think it has not been ra&s;hly undertaken, or engaged in; it being the Re&s;ult of many Years &s;erious Enquiry after the Truth; and I have in it endeavoured, in my poor Manner, to imitate the noble <HI>Bereans,</HI> who <HI>received the Word with all Rea|dine&s;s of Mind, and &s;earched the Scriptures daily, whether tho&s;e Things which they heard preached were &s;o.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="005439_0004_1018304148d39cf0">I have been from my Youth naturally inclined to en|deavour to under&s;tand what I believe; and why I be|lieve this or that Propo&s;ition to be true: And yet I very readily acknowledge, That when any Propo&s;ition is evidently delivered in the Scriptures of Truth, I ought for that Rea&s;on to believe it to be true, tho' I cannot fully comprehend the &s;ame, and am not able to an&s;wer all Objections that can be made again&s;t it: But then I mu&s;t be &s;ure that it is indeed delivered in the divine Oracles,&mdash;in which Ca&s;e <HI>every Tho't &s;hould be captivated to the Obedience of</HI> CHRIST.</P>
<P>In the little Reading for which I have had Lei&s;ure and Opportunity, I have been chiefly conver&s;ant in the Wri|tings of <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI>; yet I confe&s;s I have endeavoured not to be wholly ignorant of the Principles of tho&s;e who em|brace or incline to the <HI>Arminian Hypothe&s;is</HI>; and have always preferred the Former as much the be&s;t of the Two: So that I cannot ju&s;tly be looked upon as en|deavouring to overthrow the Fir&s;t, and e&s;tabli&s;h the O|ther. This is what I do not at all intend; but what I endeavour is, to remove &s;ome Things out of the Way, commonly a&s;&s;erted by <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> which I think may be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from their Hypothe&s;is, being no Ways ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to the Support of the principal Articles in that Scheme; but on the contrary, render it the more difficult to be received and defended. And what I to this End advance, I humbly &s;ubmit to the Cen&s;ure of the <HI>Learned</HI> and <HI>Judicious.</HI></P>
<P>What is principally in&s;i&s;ted on in this E&s;&s;ay, is, <HI>That the Offer of Salvation made to Sinners in the Go&s;pel, does compri&s;e in it an Offer, or conditional Promi&s;e, of the Grace given in Regeneration.</HI> I believe there is as
<PB N="iv" REF="005439_0005_10183043fab42320">
really a conditional Offer of this made to &s;inful Men, in the Go&s;pel of the Son of GOD, as there is of Pardon of Sin, Ju&s;tification, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In this I think I differ from mo&s;t that are in the <HI>calvinian Scheme</HI>: And I confe&s;s I was for many Years otherwi&s;e minded; but while I en|deavoured to defend what I then believed, the Objec|tions that offered them&s;elves to my Mind again&s;t what I had admitted as true, prevailed on me fir&s;t to doubt of it, and by Degrees to receive the Doctrine I now en|deavour to defend: And if I make good what I a&s;&s;ert, I think I do not therein dimini&s;h, but exalt GOD's Grace.</P>
<P>I for &s;everal Years endeavoured in a more private Way to get Satisfaction in the&s;e Points, wherein I was fallen into a Way of thinking &s;omewhat different from many others, before I entertained any Tho'ts of pub|li&s;hing my Sentiments. I frequently di&s;cour&s;ed with, and &s;ometimes wrote to learned Divines, concerning the Matters here di&s;cour&s;ed of; and had, I think, no Matter of Conviction that I was under any Mi&s;takes; much le&s;s, that I had advanced any dangerous Errors. And I cannot deny but that &s;ome pious and learned Divines have &s;poken &s;omewhat favourably of my Hy|pothe&s;is, and have expre&s;&s;ed their Willingne&s;s that I &s;hould, by the Pre&s;s, <HI>&s;hew my Opinion.</HI></P>
<P>I have in this E&s;&s;ay, endeavoured not to provoke or offend any Per&s;on what&s;oever; and now profe&s;s, that I greatly re&s;pect and honour tho&s;e, who&s;e Sentiments dif|fer from &s;ome of mine, di&s;covered in this Di&s;cour&s;e: And I have therefore cho&s;en rather to argue on the Things con&s;idered, than meddle with the Per&s;ons from who&s;e Opinions I di&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="005439_0006_10183046d91065a8">And after all that I have &s;aid for the Support of my own Hypothe&s;is, (in the Explanation of which I have endeavoured to be very <HI>free</HI> and <HI>open</HI>) I think I am fully re&s;olved &s;eriou&s;ly to weigh every Thing that &s;hall be offered for my Conviction, according to the be&s;t of my Skill and Judgment; and I hope if I am in an Er|ror, my Fault is not unpardonable.</P>
<P>I al&s;o hope, that if I am wrong in any of my Senti|ments, I have taken &s;uch Care to &s;ecure the fundamen|tal Articles in the Doctrine of <HI>Grace,</HI> that Men's Souls will not be endangered by any Thing advanced in this Attempt to &s;et &s;ome Things in a clearer Light than they &s;eem to me to be &s;et in, in &s;uch Books as I have had Opportunity to rend; but it may be thro' my own Ignorance under&s;tand not.</P>
<P>I have not in this E&s;&s;ay had any De&s;ign again&s;t the Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> GOD's <HI>eternal Decrees</HI> and <HI>Providence,</HI> the Difference betwixt <HI>common</HI> and <HI>&s;pecial Grace,</HI> and the <HI>Sovereignty of</HI> GOD in the Affair of Man's Salvation. For according to my Hypothe&s;is, as well as that I oppo&s;e, that is a great Truth maintained by the Apo&s;tle&punc; Rom. ix. <HI>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of</HI> GOD <HI>that &s;heweth Mer|cy</HI>&mdash;. The&s;e Things I not only allow, but occa&s;io|nally endeavour to defend; tho' this not being my principal De&s;ign, I have not much enlarged on them: But my main De&s;ign is that above expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>That what I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in this Treati&s;e, may not appear to be u&s;ele&s;s to &s;uch as may plea&s;e to read it, I have endeavoured to render it practical, by &s;ome u&s;eful Inferences from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">erted in it.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="005439_0007_10183048a5c46948">Tho' this E&s;&s;ay be more e&s;pecially &s;ubmitted to the Judgment and Cen&s;ure of the <HI>Learned,</HI> yet I aim at the Good of all Mankind in it; and I have written it, and do con&s;ent to it's Publication, that I might <HI>&s;erve my own Generation by the Will of God.</HI> If he approve my Attempt, he can ea&s;ily give Succe&s;s to it; if other|wi&s;e, I &s;ubmit it to him, and &s;ay, <HI>The Will of the</HI> LORD <HI>be done.</HI></P>

<Q>The Covenant being made with <HI>Adam,</HI> not only for him&s;elf, but for his Po&s;terity, all Mankind proceeding from him by ordinary Generation, &s;inned in him, and fell with him, in his fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion;</Q>
I have, on a Re|view of the Sheets printed off before the Writing of this <HI>Adverti&s;ement,</HI> cho&s;en to expre&s;s my Sen&s;e rather in the Words here following, than tho&s;e of the A&s;&s;embly referred to, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>That the Covenant being made with <HI>Adam,</HI> not for him&s;elf only, as an individual Per&s;on, but for the whole human Species then in him, the Con&s;equence hereof was, that all Mankind procee|ding from him by ordinary Generation, &s;inned in him, and fell with him, in his fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>This being my true and only Sen&s;e in the Place re|ferred to, I de&s;ire that all other Pa&s;&s;ages in the Book, of the like Import, may be under&s;tood with this Expla|nation.</P>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t Part of that Defence of the Grace of GOD which, in this E&s;&s;ay, I am attempt|ing, is to &s;hew,</P>
<P><HI>That Sinners have, in the Go&s;pel, an Offer of Salvation made to them.</HI></P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Concerning tho&s;e Sinners, and the State they are in, to whom the Offers of Salvation are here &s;uppo&s;ed to be made.</HEAD>
<P>_THAT we may under&s;tand what we &s;ay, and whereof we affirm, in this fir&s;t Part of my Di&s;cour&s;e, we mu&s;t in the fir&s;t Place con&s;ider,</P>
<P>Who the Sinners are, and in what Condition, to whom Salvation is &s;uppo&s;ed to be offered in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>To this then I &s;ay in general, That the Sinners here intended, are &s;uch as all Mankind fallen in <HI>Adam,</HI> by Nature, are; or as con&s;ider'd in that E&s;tate, into which the Fall has brought them. I do not here
<PB N="2" REF="005439_0017_1018306e41b73968">
&s;ay, That the Offer of Salvation is made to all that are in this E&s;tate; but that all unto whom the Offer of Salvation is &s;uppo&s;ed to be made, are of this Number; and &s;uch an E&s;tate as this they all, by their Fall and Apo&s;tacy from God, have been plunged into.</P>
<P>Now, that this is a very mi&s;erable and wretched E&s;tate, is by all <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> acknowledged; and in this I fully agree with them; and &s;hall endeavour, as briefly as I can, to &s;hew wherein the Mi&s;ery of this E&s;tate does con&s;i&s;t. And to this End, I &s;hall here take a &s;hort View of the Wretchedne&s;s of that E&s;tate, into which Mankind have, by their Apo&s;tacy, brought them&s;elves.</P>
<P>To this End, the fir&s;t Thing I &s;hall ob&s;erve, is, That the Sin of our fir&s;t Parents in eating the forbidden Fruit, was exceeding great and heinous. It was a Sin again&s;t an expre&s;s and po&s;itive Command of God, immediately and plainly given to them by God him&s;elf, to which they were, on their Peril, required to yield Obedience, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. So that it was a Sin again&s;t Light and Knowledge, and a very pre&s;umptuous Sin. It was al&s;o a Sin again&s;t the mo&s;t endear|ing Di&s;coveries of the Goodne&s;s of God to them. God had newly created them in his own <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Likene&s;s,</HI> Gen. 1.26, 27. and in his Favour, with Dominion over the Works of his Hands; and had plainly enough, for them to under&s;tand, promi&s;ed Life to them on Condition of their Obedience to him; tho' this Promi&s;e was only implied in the contrary Threatning, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. They wanted not Power to keep this Commandment; but might have continued in their Obedience to it, if they had watched and prayed, that they might not have fallen into <HI>Temptation</HI>; and endeavoured to with&s;tand <HI>the &s;ame</HI>: This, I think, none will deny. They had no Need to eat of the Fruit forbidden them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ving Plenty enough be&s;ides, no other Trees in that rich and plentiful Garden being denied to them. They had no Need, nor Warrant, to &s;eek after a better Condition, at pre&s;ent, than that they were in. They had, no doubt, before they had &s;inned, enjoyed happy Communion with God, and one with ano|ther. They had no Warrant to hold a Parly with the Serpent en|deavouring to entice them from their Obedience and Allegiance to their Creator and &s;overeign Lord; much le&s;s to believe him in what he &s;aid, in direct Oppo&s;ition to that God that cannot Lie; and fol|low his Conduct, in direct Oppo&s;ition to the divine Command.</P>
<P>It was enough for them that God had created them in his own Image, in Re&s;pect of Knowledge, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s. They &s;hould not have a&s;pired to have been more like God in Knowledge, than he made them, or rather to be equal to him, as in <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.5, 6.
<PB N="3" REF="005439_0018_1018306fcff03b10">
Nor &s;hould they have taken Part with the Devil to this End. Thus heinous was their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and much more might here be &s;aid. This is that Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> which is, by <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be im|puted to his Po&s;terity, which I, at pre&s;ent, take for granted, but may con&s;ider hereafter.</P>
<P>What I &s;hall here next mention, &s;hall be &s;ome of the immediate and nece&s;&s;ary Effects, or Con&s;equents of this now mentioned heinous Sin: I mean &s;uch Con&s;equents as follow'd naturally from the Crime com|mitted, without any Con&s;ideration of the <HI>Threatning</HI> denounced, in Ca&s;e of Di&s;obedience: <HI>That</HI> &s;hall anon be con&s;idered. Now this could not but produce extraordinary Shame and Horror, unle&s;s God had (which was not the Ca&s;e) given up the Offenders to a mo&s;t unaccountable Stupidity. I &s;uppo&s;e God had a De&s;ign to make the Promi&s;e of the Seed that was to break the Serpent's Head, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15. very welcome to them.</P>
<P>We may accordingly &s;ee what Shame and Confu&s;ion of Face &s;eized on them, Gen. 3.7, 8, 9, 10. <HI>And the Eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they &s;ewed Fig-Leaves together, and made them&s;elves Aprons. And they heard the Voice of the Lord God, walking in the Garden, in the Cool of the Day: And</HI> Adam <HI>and his Wife hid them&s;elves from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord God, among the Trees of the Garden. And God called unto</HI> Adam, <HI>and &s;aid unto him, Where art thou? And he &s;aid, I heard thy Voice in the Garden: And I was afraid; becau&s;e I was naked, and I hid my &s;elf.</HI> Nor did the Shame or Confu&s;ion which the&s;e Offenders were thus in, ari&s;e wholly, (if principally) from the Threatning that had been denounced; but very much, (e&s;pecially their Shame) from a Sen&s;e of the mo&s;t vile Wick|edne&s;s whereof they had been guilty. This &s;eems evident from the Que&s;tion God put to <HI>Adam,</HI> ver. 11. <HI>And he &s;aid, Who told thee that thou wa&s;t naked? Ha&s;t thou eaten of the Tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou &s;hould&s;t not eat.</HI></P>
<P>So heinous was this Offence, which was by <HI>the&s;e</HI> committed, that they could not but be in great Horror on the Account of it; tho' they had tho't nothing of the Evil threatned again&s;t them. Nor could they have had any great Rea&s;on to hope for a Pardon, tho' they had never been threatned; and tho' they could not have known what Puni&s;hment God would have laid on them: And yet I acknowledge, there would not have been Ground for utter De&s;pair.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore now come to con&s;ider their Guilt, as this &s;ignifies an Obligation lving on them to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r the Puni&s;hment due to them by
<PB N="4" REF="005439_0019_101830735c6b3908">
Virtue of that Sanction of the Law, <HI>In the Day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> Guilt, I think, may be taken, either for a Per|&s;on's being truly chargeable with &s;ome Sin or Crime; and this the Per&s;ons were, of whom I here &s;peak, of which before: Or it may be taken for that Obligation, by which the Offender is bound to &s;uffer the Penalty due to him for his Offence; and this is that which I am here to con&s;ider in the Ca&s;e before me. What was intended by the Death threatned, I am not yet come to take an Account of; but the Nature of the Obligation, and the Con&s;equences thence ari&s;ing, is what, at pre&s;ent, I am upon: And this is expre&s;s'd in &s;uch &s;trong Terms in the Text mentioned, that the Offenders, I think, had no Grounds given them to hope that the Sentence might be rever&s;ed. I mean, they had not, before <HI>the Seed of the Woman</HI> was promi&s;ed, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15. No wonder then that the Offenders were in &s;uch a Plight as they were, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.11.</P>
<P>The Covenant of Works was doubtle&s;s given to be a &s;tanding Rule, according to which God was re&s;olved to deal with Mankind; and by which he obliged him&s;elf to give them Life, in Ca&s;e of con&s;tant and perfect Obedience to him, and a&s;&s;ured them that they &s;hould die in Ca&s;e of the lea&s;t Failure or Di&s;obedience, as by comparing <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. with <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10, 12. and <HI>James</HI> 2.10. does appear. And God was plea&s;ed to try Man's Obedience in one &s;ingle In&s;tance, before they had committed any other Offence again&s;t him. Now on this Trial, they mo&s;t vilely for&s;ook their Allegiance to him, and wickedly rebell'd again&s;t him: Which, having done, for any Thing that did appear, there was nothing to be expected, but the Execution of the threatned Sentence on them They were for the pre&s;ent bound over, as the fallen Angels were, with whom they had joined again&s;t God, <HI>unto the Judgment of the great Day</HI>; and had no Rea&s;on to expect any Thing better than what, in the Threatning, God had denounced again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The Day of their Probation was now ended, and the Covenant broken betwixt them and the great God, and no Repentance or Obe|dience was by that Covenant now requir'd of them: Nor had they any other Relation to it, than that of capital Offenders, doom'd to pre&s;ent Death by it: Nor was there yet any Way of E&s;cape propos'd to them; nor, as far as did appear, any Room for God to treat with them, or they with him, on any Terms of Reconciliation what&s;oever.</P>
<P>This was the State in which Mankind now were, and they doubt|le&s;s were &s;en&s;ible how Matters &s;tood betwixt God and them; and they had Rea&s;on to be filled with Dread and Amazement, as it &s;eems
<PB N="5" REF="005439_0020_101830751d5dcab0">
they were. Nor had they any Room or Hearts to beg for a Pardon. What a terrible Condition was this? They were, in Re&s;pect of the Sentence pronounc'd again&s;t them, as dead Men, as &s;oon as ever they had &s;inned.</P>
<P>But the Mi&s;ery of the&s;e Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors will further appear, if we con&s;ider what that Death was, which, by the Sanction of the Law, they were thus bound over unto. And this I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew; only I &s;hall here fir&s;t ob&s;erve, that the Death threatned again&s;t the&s;e Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors did not, properly &s;peaking, con&s;i&s;t at all in the Obligation they were under to &s;uffer it. For tho' &s;uch as are under a Sentence of Death, are &s;ometimes &s;poken of as dead Men, as was before ob&s;erved; yet there is a Difference between Men's being under a Sentence of Death, and their actually dying; or betwixt a Judg|ment pa&s;&s;ed on them, and the Execution of it: However, a Sentence of Death is very terrible.</P>
<P>And now I may, without any further Delay, &s;hew what Death the&s;e Malefactors were by the Law of God &s;entenced unto. I &s;ay then, <HI>the&s;e</HI> were, by the Threatning annexed to the Law of God, Sentenced to undergo a threefold Death, which I &s;hall &s;peak &s;omething concerning in the Order now to be expre&s;&s;ed. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Kind of Death intended in the Threatning, undoubt|edly was that which we commonly call <HI>Death &s;piritual.</HI></P>
<P>That Mankind are by Nature &s;piritually dead, the Scriptures abundantly te&s;tify: And for the clearing up of what I here a&s;&s;ert, I &s;hall &s;hew (1.) Wherein this Death does con&s;i&s;t. (2.) That this came on our fir&s;t Parents as a Puni&s;hment of their Sin, in eating the for|bidden Fruit.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Let us con&s;ider wherein this Death con&s;i&s;teth. Now to this I &s;ay, that this Death con&s;i&s;teth in the Lo&s;s of the Image of God, which Man was created in, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.26, 27. or that Rectitude or Integrity, of which he was the Subject, when he was in that E&s;tate wherein he was created. Eccl. 7.29. <HI>God made Man upright.</HI> This did not con&s;i&s;t in the E&s;&s;ence of Man's Soul; for if it had, he could not have lo&s;t it: But it con&s;i&s;ted in that habitual Conformity of the Soul to the holy Nature and Will of God, which was con|created with it, and was the Bond of its Union with God, while Man enjoy'd it; <HI>for he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit</HI> with him, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.17. This was Man's Life, while he was in a State of
<PB N="6" REF="005439_0021_1018307732ccab50">
Innocency; and is &s;o again, when he is <HI>renewed in Knowledge and Righteou&s;ne&s;s after the Image of him that created him,</HI> Col. 3.10. Men de&s;titute of it are &s;aid to be <HI>alienated from the Life of God,</HI> Eph. 4.18. To be without this is Death, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.6. This Principle of Life is in Scripture call'd <HI>the divine Nature,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.4. <HI>The Seed of God,</HI> 1 John 3.9. Tho&s;e who have it not, have not <HI>eternal Life abiding in them,</HI> ver. 15. but on the contrary, <HI>are dead in Sins, and in the Uncircumci&s;ion of the Fle&s;h,</HI> Col. 2.13. When &s;uch are &s;aid to be dead; and when their Deprivation of &s;uch a divine Principle is called Death; the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions are, I acknowledge, metaphorical; and the Metaphor is taken from the Likene&s;s which there is, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, betwixt a proper Death and this. Men, in this E&s;tate, being as uncapable of performing any Actions that are truly &s;piritual and holy, as Men naturally dead are of performing the Actions to which natural Life is required, Rom, 8.6, 7, 8. <HI>For to be carnally minded is Death: But to be &s;piritually minded is Life and Peace; becau&s;e the carnal Mind is Enmity again&s;t God: For it is not &s;ubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the Fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e God.</HI> 1 Cor. 2.14. <HI>But the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God, for they are Fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him: Neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</HI> This Death does not, pro|perly &s;peaking, con&s;i&s;t either in Men's doing that which they &s;hould not, or in omitting or neglecting that which they &s;hould do; but in their Want of &s;uch a Principle as is nece&s;&s;ary to their doing that which is, in a &s;trict Sen&s;e, holy and good; and in a right Manner avoiding to do the contrary, <HI>i.e.</HI> from a Hatred of it, and a Love to that which is good. This, I think, is too plain to need any Illu&s;tra|tion. Thus briefly of this Kind of Death.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) I am to &s;hew, That this came on our <HI>fir&s;t Parents,</HI> as a Puni&s;hment of their Sin, and that it belong'd to the Death threatned. I &s;ay our <HI>fir&s;t Parents</HI>; for as yet I con&s;ider not how their Po&s;terity became in this Sen&s;e dead. That <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>his Wife</HI> were thus dead, immediately after they had committed their fir&s;t and great Offence, I think to be an evident Truth. If they had remained habitually holy after they had committed their fir&s;t Sin, they would certainly have carried them&s;elves far otherwi&s;e than they did. They would not have attempted to hide them&s;elves from God, as they endeavoured to do, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.8. In which they di&s;covered much Athei&s;m, and very wrong Thoughts of God, from who&s;e Pre&s;ence it is impo&s;&s;ible to hide, <HI>Jer.</HI> 23.24. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 39.8,&mdash;12.) in&s;tead of lamenting and confe&s;&s;ing their heinous Offence, and ju&s;tifying God, as by the Law of their
<PB N="7" REF="005439_0022_1018307a84146730">
Creation, (but not as a Covenant of Works) they were obliged to do. They mo&s;t wickedly endeavoured to ju&s;tify them&s;elves, and ca&s;t the Blame of their Fall on the God that made them, ver. 12, 13. So that by this Carriage of their's, they gave Occa&s;ion for &s;uch a Reflection on them as that in Job 31.33. <HI>If I covered my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion as</HI> Adam, <HI>by hiding mine Iniquity in my Bo&s;om.</HI> Does it not now appear, that <HI>the&s;e</HI> had, immediately after their Fall, a very corrupt Nature in them? And indeed, if by <HI>Adam</HI>'s fir&s;t Offence all Mankind were made in this Sen&s;e Sinners, as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12, and ver. 19. how can it be thought po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould him&s;elf e&s;cape becoming &s;uch an One, when he had committed that heinous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t a little con&s;ider how this came to be the Con&s;equence of our fir&s;t Parents committing their fir&s;t and great Offence. And here I will &s;hew, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> negatively, from whence this did not ari&s;e; and <HI>&s;econdly</HI> po&s;itively, what was the Cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Negatively, I &s;ay, This did not flow wholly nor principally from the natural Influence of that Sin, which they had newly com|mitted. Tho' &s;inful Actions naturally produce and increa&s;e an In|clination or Di&s;po&s;ition to &s;in yet more; and if they be often repeated, they beget a &s;trong Habit, inclining the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors to go on &s;till in their wicked Cour&s;es, as in <HI>Jer.</HI> 13.23. Yet the Sin of the&s;e Per&s;ons could not alone utterly eradicate all pious Di&s;po&s;itions out of their Souls. Sinful Actions diver&s;e Times repeated would &s;carce of it&s;elf have done this; much le&s;s could one &s;ingle Act of Di&s;obedience have had &s;uch an Influence, if there had been nothing el&s;e in the Ca&s;e; but <HI>Adam</HI> might, and it is very probable he would, this not|with&s;tanding, have bitterly bewail'd his Fall, and earne&s;tly begg'd the Pardon of it; and perhaps have obtain'd it, and then had grown more watchful and circum&s;pect in his after Conver&s;ation, as is often the Ca&s;e of good Men now: But it was far from being thus with him: Sin had immediately Dominion over him, and reigned in him&punc; Wherefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Rea&s;on hereof was this, God having threatned he &s;hould &s;ure|ly die in the Day he &s;inned; and being greatly provoked at him for the horrible Wickedne&s;s he had committed, (of which before) did imme|diately begin to execute the Sentence on him, which he was now fallen under: And this he did in the fir&s;t Place, by utterly taking his holy Spirit from him; the Con&s;equence of which was, that he immediately, and without any po&s;itive Act of God, infu&s;ing any &s;inful
<PB N="8" REF="005439_0023_1018308129c705c8">
Di&s;po&s;itions into him, became a mo&s;t vile Mi&s;creant; a Child of the Devil, full of all Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the&s;e Things following, it will appear that it mu&s;t needs have been &s;o. (1.) God had obliged him&s;elf by his Word immediately to &s;lay him, if he &s;inned again&s;t him, with this only Re|&s;erve in his own Brea&s;t, unle&s;s a Mediator &s;hould interpo&s;e to offer Satisfaction for his Offence, and reprieve him from pre&s;ent De&s;truc|tion. We know certainly by the Event, that there was this Excep|tion; and the Apo&s;tle &s;hews plainly, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.25, 26. that God could not in Ju&s;tice have &s;pared him, in any other Way. The Threatning was ab&s;olute, and expre&s;s'd in the &s;tronge&s;t Terms; and was to be immediately executed. To imagine it only &s;hew'd what the Crime de&s;erved, &s;eems to me to be mo&s;t vain. (2.) Man being in &s;uch a State of Condemnation, it would not con&s;i&s;t with either the e&s;&s;ential, or rectoral Holine&s;s of God, to hold any &s;uch Communion with him, as he does, and will hold, with &s;uch as are his Friends and Favourites. He was a Traitor again&s;t the King of Heaven, and by Law condemned to Death for his Crime. How can we now imagine, that God might, while he was under this Sentence, deal with him as with a Friend and dear Child, with whom he was at Peace, when yet he was under his Wrath. (3.) Yet it mu&s;t have been thus, if <HI>Adam</HI> after his falling under a Sentence of Death, had remained a holy Man &s;till, being &s;till endowed with God's Image, tho' but in &s;uch a Mea|&s;ure, as the lea&s;t of Saints now are. If <HI>Adam,</HI> after his Fall, had had but a Spark of true Holine&s;s remaining in his Soul, he mu&s;t &s;till have had holy Communion with the ble&s;&s;ed God; and God with him: That mu&s;t have &s;till been the Language of his Soul, in P&s;al. 73.25. <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And there is none upon Earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ides thee</HI>: And of God, with Re&s;pect to him, it might have been truly &s;aid, as in P&s;al. 147.11. <HI>The Lord taketh Plea&s;ure in them that fear him.</HI> This cannot be denied to hold true with Re&s;pect to all &s;uch as truly fear God. Now it was impo&s;&s;ible that <HI>Adam</HI> &s;hould have enjoyed &s;uch Favours, while under a Sentence of Damnation. It followeth (4.) That our fir&s;t Parents being fallen under a Sentence of Death, could no longer enjoy tho&s;e Influences of the Spirit of God, by which their habitual Holine&s;s might be pre&s;erved; or, in other Words, they could not have remained <HI>Temples of the Holy Gho&s;t</HI>; but mu&s;t needs have been utterly and immediately de&s;erted by him. That mu&s;t and did now befall him, which <HI>David</HI> &s;o earne&s;tly depre|cated, in P&s;al. 51.11. <HI>Ca&s;t me not away from thy Pre&s;ence: And take not thy holy Spirit from me.</HI> And being thus for&s;aken, they were indeed
<PB N="9" REF="005439_0024_1018308369ab8e88">
no better than the fallen Angels, with whom they had joined in their Rebellion again&s;t the holy God. Being thus wholly dead in Sin, &s;piritually dead, they were in this Re&s;pect Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath fitted for De&s;truction.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire it may be here remembred, and laid up in our Minds, to be recollected and improv'd, That the &s;piritual Death, of which I have been &s;peaking, did not precede, or go before, that Sentence of Death, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. but belong'd to the Death there threatned, as the Wages of Sin, even of <HI>Adam</HI>'s actual Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, in eating the for|bidden Fruit; becau&s;e from hence it followeth, that this Sentence of Death mu&s;t be taken off from the Sinner, before &s;piritual Life can be again re&s;tored to him.</P>
<P>Before I pa&s;s to the next Head, I &s;hall here briefly ob&s;erve, that as this &s;piritual Death did not properly con&s;i&s;t in <HI>Adam</HI>'s fir&s;t Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, but was a Fruit of it; &s;o neither does it properly con&s;i&s;t in tho&s;e actual Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions which Sinners in a State of Nature do commit; but is the Fountain from which they flow, <HI>Matth.</HI> 15.19. and <HI>Luke</HI> 6.43, 45, 46.</P>
<P>Let it be here al&s;o ob&s;erved, that the Dominion which Man's &s;pi|ritual Enemies had over him after his Fall, tho' compri&s;ed or implied in the Death threatned to be executed on him; yet was it not properly Part of that &s;piritual Death, of which I have been now &s;peaking: But Man's fir&s;t Sin, and the &s;piritual Death that followed thereon, was what has given the Enemies of Men's Souls, &s;uch an Advantage as they have over all tho&s;e who are dead in Sin. Of the great Power of the&s;e Enemies over &s;uch as are <HI>dead in Sins and Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es,</HI> we have an Account, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.2.2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.26. and el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd Kind of Death mentioned, as threatned again&s;t our fir&s;t Parents, in Ca&s;e they eat the forbidden Fruit, was <HI>Death tempo|ral</HI>: By which I under&s;tand Death, properly &s;o called, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sepa|ration of Soul and Body one from the other; of which Death we have a De&s;cription in <HI>Eccl.</HI> 12.7. That this Kind of Death was intended in the Threatning, we have Rea&s;on to think; for (1.) This is Death, in the mo&s;t proper and literal Sen&s;e of the Word, and &s;o is mo&s;t ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed to be here meant; there being no good Rea&s;on to be given to the contrary. (2.) This Kind of Death is expre&s;ly mentioned in the Judgment God pa&s;&s;ed on <HI>Adam</HI> after he had &s;inned, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.19. (3.) <HI>Adam</HI> did, and his Off-&s;pring do, generally die this Kind of Death. (4.) Tho' all Men, without Exception, do not thus die, this does not prove, that <HI>Adam</HI> was not threatned with this Kind of
<PB N="10" REF="005439_0025_10183085a108ae28">
Death; becau&s;e their e&s;caping it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be owing to the Interpo&s;ition of a Mediator. I could give other Rea&s;ons for this, if it were needful.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame Rea&s;on that &s;ome Men die not at all, <HI>Adam</HI> did not die as &s;oon as he had &s;inned, <HI>viz.</HI> the Interpo&s;ition of a Mediator, to offer Satisfaction for Sin, and reprieve him from pre&s;ent Death, and this in order to his eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>I know many think otherwi&s;e, not under&s;tanding the Threatning, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. as I do, but holding the Meaning to be, That <HI>Adam</HI> &s;hould, as &s;oon as he had &s;inned, become mortal, grow &s;ickly and in|firm, and &s;hould at la&s;t give up the Gho&s;t; and I grant, that, as Things have been &s;ince ordered, with Relation to &s;inful Men, this Expo&s;ition &s;eems to agree well with the Event. But we ought to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the real Intention and De&s;ign of God, the Law-giver, and the true Meaning of his Law. The Que&s;tion here is not, What God really intended to do, in Ca&s;e <HI>Adam</HI> &s;inn'd? But, What mu&s;t be done in Ca&s;e the Threatning &s;hould be executed according to the true Meaning of it? And con&s;equently, what <HI>Adam</HI> was to expect if he eat the forbidden Fruit?</P>
<P>Now there is no Que&s;tion to me, but that the Meaning of the Threatning was, That our fir&s;t Parents &s;hould immediately die a proper Death, in Ca&s;e they &s;inned; only God did not &s;o threaten this, as not to leave Room to have the Execution delay'd, in Ca&s;e of the Interpo&s;ition of a Mediator; yea, and to have it finally remitted, in Ca&s;e full Satisfaction &s;hould be given for the Offence. This has been made evident in the Event: But for all this, the true Meaning of the Law might be, That <HI>Adam</HI> &s;hould die in the Day he &s;inned, with the Exception only now expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>And it is certain, that this is the mo&s;t proper and literal Sen&s;e of the Threatning, in the Place referred to, and &s;o what we ought not to recede from, unle&s;s by &s;ome urgent Nece&s;&s;ity we are compell'd to it; which I hope I &s;hall make it appear, that we are not, when I come to &s;peak of the Imputation of <HI>Adam</HI>'s fir&s;t Sin to his Po&s;terity; and &s;hew how they partake of the Guilt, and become liable to the Puni&s;hment of that great Offence; which Doctrine, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Hypothe&s;is I here proceed on, is no Ways inimical unto; but that it does, on the contrary, greatly favour it. I therefore now proceed to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="11" REF="005439_0026_1018308b39e146a8">3. What the third Death was, which <HI>Adam</HI> was threatned with, in Ca&s;e of Di&s;obedience: And to this I &s;ay, That eternal Puni&s;h|ment in another Life and World was doubtle&s;s intended in the Threat|ning: For which I give the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. Since Life eternal was by Promi&s;e engaged to him, in Ca&s;e of Obedience, &s;uch a Promi&s;e being implied in the Threatning denounced; &s;o that <HI>Adam</HI> was to have enjoy'd po&s;itive Happine&s;s, and that for|ever, on the mentioned Condition; it &s;eemeth not rea&s;onable to think, that an eternal Puni&s;hment of Pain and Grief was not intended in the threatned Death: For thus the Evil threatned had not, in its Na|ture and Duration, been commen&s;urate with the Good promi&s;ed. That, in the Threatning of Death, a Promi&s;e of Life was implied, will not, I &s;uppo&s;e, be denied: And this Life mu&s;t needs have been the &s;ame, or a better than that which <HI>Adam</HI> then enjoy'd in the <HI>Garden of Eden,</HI> which none can deny to have been a Life of po&s;itive Happine&s;s. Had <HI>Adam</HI> continued in his Obedience, he would have been greatly deceived, if he had ever been deprived of that Happine&s;s, and not had a greater given to him.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Suppo&s;ition of <HI>Adam</HI>'s not being in a mi&s;erable State, after this Life, having &s;inned, and being deprived of all Happine&s;s, nece&s;|&s;arily implieth the Mortality of his Soul. For unto what End &s;hould he be continued in Being, if he were to be neither happy nor mi&s;e|rable? And how incon&s;i&s;tent is this with the Nature of a rational Being, capable of Happine&s;s, and de&s;irous of it? For &s;uch an one to be without it, mu&s;t needs be a Torment to him. Therefore, to deny that <HI>Adam</HI> mu&s;t have been mi&s;erable after this Life, is, in effect, to deny, that his Soul &s;hould have &s;urvived, when his Body &s;hould have returned to the Du&s;t; as in <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.19. and <HI>Eccl.</HI> 12.7. Now, if <HI>Adam</HI>'s Soul was mortal, why not other Men's too? Contrary to <HI>Matth.</HI> 10.28. and <HI>Luke</HI> 16.22.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Scriptures, by oppo&s;ing that Death, which is the Wages of Sin, to Life eternal, do &s;ufficiently intimate to us, that that Death is eternal; &s;o in Rom. 6.22. <HI>The Wages of Sin is Death; but the Gift of God i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> eternal Life.</HI> Now, can there be any Rea&s;on to que&s;|tion, whether <HI>Adam</HI> was to die &s;uch a Death? Was not the Death threatned again&s;t him, the Wages of a mo&s;t vile Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion? The Death which he was to die, was doubtle&s;s the &s;ame which tho&s;e are freed from, who believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>John</HI> 3.16. The Seed of the Woman, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.16. was doubtle&s;s promi&s;ed to &s;ave <HI>Adam</HI> and

others from this Death, call'd <HI>the Wrath to come,</HI> 1 The&s;. 1.10. <HI>Je&s;us which delivereth us from the Wrath to come.</HI> The &s;ame is called <HI>the &s;econd Death,</HI> Rev. 20.6. Should not <HI>Adam</HI> have died this Death as well as others, if he had not been redeemed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Is not this Death included in that which entred into the World by <HI>Adam</HI>'s fir&s;t Offence; <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12. And if &s;o, was not he him&s;elf liable to it? No doubt it was the &s;ame with that everla&s;ting Puni&s;h|ment which the damned are &s;ent into, Matth. 25.46. <HI>The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment; but the Righteous into Life eternal.</HI></P>
<P>Having now con&s;idered the woful Effects and Con&s;equents of our fir&s;t Parents fir&s;t and great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, as the&s;e related to them|&s;elves, per&s;onally con&s;idered; I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider them, as they related to their Children or Off-&s;pring. And here, I take it for granted, (and do my &s;elf believe, as in the &s;horter Catechi&s;m of the A&s;&s;embly of Divines at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI>) That,
<Q>the Covenant being made with <HI>Adam,</HI> not for him&s;elf only, but for his Po&s;terity, all Mankind proceeding from him, by ordinary Generation, &s;in|ned in him, and fell with him, in his fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>Now here I might have concluded the fir&s;t Chapter, in this fir&s;t Part of my E&s;&s;ay; (my De&s;ign in it not being to prove tho&s;e Things wherein I and others with whom I therein have to do, are agreed) but becau&s;e of the great Importance of the Doctrine a&s;&s;erted, in Re|&s;pect of the Influence, Men's different Apprehen&s;ions about it will nece&s;&s;arily have on their Principles, concerning &s;everal other Points of Religion, I &s;hall endeavour to give my Readers &s;uch an Explana|tion of this great Truth, as I apprehend to be mo&s;t agreeable to the Oracles of God, and, as I think, will have a Tendency to remove &s;ome of the Prejudices, which the Minds of many are apt to fill'd with again&s;t it; but will endeavour to &s;ay Nothing but what will be co-incident with it.</P>
<P>And in the fir&s;t Place, I &s;uppo&s;e the Covenant, in the&s;e Words referred to, is that of Works, made with Man, while he was in a State of Innocency; and that this is the &s;ame that God made with our fir&s;t Parents, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. wherein he forbid them <HI>to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, on pain of Death</HI>: In which Threat|ning of Death, there was a Promi&s;e of Life, in Ca&s;e of Obedience, plainly implied. God was plea&s;ed in this Precept or Prohibition to try Man's Obedience to him, as in a particular In&s;tance; and in his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of this, that was verified, Jam. 2.10. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one Point, he is guilty of all.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005439_0028_10183093346f0110"><HI>Adam, i. e.</HI> Man, with whom this Covenant is &s;aid to have been made, was not <HI>Adam</HI> only, as that Name is &s;ometimes &s;trictly taken for the Per&s;on of the fir&s;t Man, but for <HI>Adam,</HI> or Man, taken col|lectively, <HI>i. e.</HI> the whole Species of Mankind, Male and Female, as in <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.28. <HI>Job</HI> 28.28. <HI>Eve</HI> therefore rightly under&s;tood her|&s;elf to be included in it, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.2, 3. Thus, tho' <HI>Adam</HI> was per|&s;onally &s;poken to, yet it really did include his Po&s;terity al&s;o; and there was the more Rea&s;on that it &s;hould do &s;o, becau&s;e the whole Species of Mankind did then exi&s;t in the two Per&s;ons, with whom at fir&s;t it was more immediately made. The Per&s;ons of their Off-&s;pring did not then, indeed, per&s;onally &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but the whole human Na|ture, and all that was e&s;&s;ential to it, did; and &s;o all tho&s;e that were by God's Command and Benediction to be propagated in the Way of natural Generation, by or from our fir&s;t Parents. <HI>They</HI> have Nothing in them but what e&s;&s;entially belong'd to <HI>the&s;e.</HI> They are only <HI>Adam</HI> multiplied, according to God's Ordinance, above men|tioned. And <HI>Adam</HI>'s Children being of the &s;ame Nature and Make as he was, would undoubtedly have done as he did, if they had been put on the &s;ame Trial.</P>
<P>But I do not &s;ay, that <HI>Adam</HI>'s Off-&s;pring being in this Sen&s;e in him was that which con&s;tituted him their legal Head and Repre&s;en|tative. It was their being comprehended in the Covenant that did this; and that they were &s;o appears by their being made Sinners by <HI>Adam</HI>'s one Offence, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12,&mdash;19. If <HI>they</HI> had not been intended in the Threatning, as well as our fir&s;t Parents them&s;elves, the &s;ame Death had not come on them for the &s;ame Offence, as it plainly appears it did; tho' it was the more congruous that they &s;hould be comprehended in the Covenant becau&s;e they were <HI>Adam</HI>'s Po&s;terity, and he their natural Head; yet that they are affected, as they are, by his Sin and Fall, does immediately ari&s;e and flow from their being comprehended in the Covenant, as they mo&s;t certainly were.</P>
<P>It appears from what has been now &s;aid, That <HI>Adam</HI>'s Po&s;terity were in him in a two-fold Re&s;pect. (1.) They were in him in a natural Sen&s;e, as Branches are naturally in their Root or Stock, before they grow out of it. (2.) They were in him in a relative and moral Sen&s;e, as he was their appointed Head and Repre&s;entative: And I acknowledge, that without being in him in this latter Sen&s;e, they could not have &s;inned in him and fallen with him in his fir&s;t Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. And this is the Rea&s;on why Children now are not charge|able with the Sins of their immediate Parents. God has not appointed their immediate Parents to be their moral Head or Repre&s;entative.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="005439_0029_10183095e7ef53e0">The Covenant being thus made with <HI>Adam</HI> for his Po&s;terity as well as him&s;elf, he virtually repre&s;ented them, before they actually &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; &s;o that his Carriage, before they had, in this Sen&s;e, any Being, would affect their Per&s;ons as &s;oon as they &s;hould exi&s;t. And &s;ince he repre&s;ented none, but what were in the Way of natural Ge|neration to de&s;cend from him, none could partake with him in his Guilt, and the Death threatned, 'till in this Way they had a Being: And con&s;equently, if it had &s;o fallen out, that none had ever been bro't into the World, in the Way mentioned, then none &s;hould ever have &s;uffered any Pain or Torment, in Ca&s;e of his eating of the forbidden Tree; becau&s;e &s;uch Suffering &s;uppo&s;eth the Exi&s;tence of the Per&s;ons &s;uffering: And the &s;ame will hold with Re&s;pect to the Reward of his Obedience, had he not &s;inned: His Po&s;terity having the Advan|tage of it, did nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e, that, in order to it, they mu&s;t fir&s;t exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Now Things &s;tanding thus, betwixt the ble&s;&s;ed God and Mankind, before <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall; and <HI>Adam</HI> having then Power to have continued in that State of Integrity, wherein he was created; and being liable withal to fall from it, by eating the forbidden Fruit, &s;o, that, ac|cording to the Nature of &s;econd Cau&s;es, either of the&s;e might come to pa&s;s, and one or the other of them would certainly do &s;o: We may briefly con&s;ider the Effects or Con&s;equents of each of the&s;e &s;up|po&s;ed Events; but mu&s;t here con&s;ider the&s;e with Relation to that Co|venant which Man was then in, without any Relation to the Covenant of Grace made with Man after his Sin and Fall; and thus we &s;hall &s;ee how Things mu&s;t have been, in either of the&s;e Ca&s;es, had no Media|tor been provided.</P>
<P>And here fir&s;t let us &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Adam</HI> had &s;tood and not eaten of the forbidden Tree. When I here make this Suppo&s;ition, by <HI>Adam</HI>'s continuing in his Obedience, I mean his having done &s;o during that Time which God had allotted for the Trial of his Obedience to that po&s;itive Ordinance of his; on <HI>Adam</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation of which, his own and his Off-&s;pring's Happine&s;s did depend: But how long a Time this was to have been, I cannot determine. God did not, in the Covenant made with <HI>Adam,</HI> limit any certain Time for this, but kept his Mind to him&s;elf: Only we know, that in Ca&s;e of Sin, the Time was out as &s;oon as it &s;hould be committed. But how long Man mu&s;t have continued in his Obedience, before he &s;hould, on the Terms of that Covenant, have had a Title to Life, I cannot &s;ay: But I think it is very probable, that if <HI>Adam</HI> had not fallen before he
<PB N="15" REF="005439_0030_1018309ae1687998">
had any I&s;&s;ue, God would not have permitted his falling into that Sin afterwards. For, on this Suppo&s;ition, it &s;eems, that &s;ome of his Off-&s;pring would have been born in a State of Sin and others not, (&s;hould he have had any after his Fall) which, I think, would not agree with the great End which God aimed at in this whole Affair, of which we have an Account, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.19. and mo&s;t plainly in <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.32. <HI>God hath concluded them all in Unbelief, that he might have Mercy on all.</HI></P>
<P>And to me it is not at all improbable, that if our fir&s;t Parents had endured that fir&s;t Shock, by which they fell into Sin, God would have confirmed them in a State of Innocency, and not have &s;uffered another A&s;&s;ault to be made on them. I know of no Rea&s;on to con|clude, that he would not have done thus; and that, on this Suppo&s;ition, <HI>Adam</HI> and his Off-&s;pring would have been happy for ever.</P>
<P>It is here &s;uppo&s;ed that if our fir&s;t Parents had not &s;inned, they would have had a Po&s;terity in the World. That Command and Be|nediction of God given to them, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.28. will not admit of the lea&s;t Doubt of this: And that, on this Suppo&s;ition, <HI>Adam</HI>'s Po&s;terity &s;hould none of them ever have &s;een Death, I think unque&s;tionable. Nor do I imagine, that they would all have lived in this little World forever; but &s;uppo&s;e it more than likely, that after they had for a Time <HI>&s;erv'd their Generation by the Will of God,</HI> they would have been tran&s;lated into the heavenly World, as <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elijah</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. 5.24. Heb. 11.5.2 Kings 2.11.</NOTE> were, and as the Saints that &s;hall be alive on the Earth, at the &s;econd Coming of our Lord <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;. 4.17.</NOTE>, will be.</P>
<P>Thus far have I con&s;idered how it would have fared with <HI>Adam</HI>'s Off-&s;pring, on Suppo&s;ition of his keeping the fir&s;t Covenant; I &s;hall now con&s;ider what the Effects and Con&s;equents of his breaking that Covenant mu&s;t have been, according to the Tenor of it; and if a Mediator had not interpo&s;ed to offer a Price of Redemption for the&s;e Offenders: Of which more afterwards. And to this I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I am fully of Opinion, that in this Ca&s;e the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors mu&s;t have been immediately &s;lain. Judgment mu&s;t have been &s;peedily executed on them, there being no Rea&s;on or Room for delaying it.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that in this I differ from many wi&s;e and learned Men, who&s;e Opinion is, that the Threatning denounced <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. did not intend that the Offenders &s;hould immediately &s;uffer a temporal or proper Death; but that they &s;hould immediately become frail and
<PB N="16" REF="005439_0031_1018309cc0c77680">
mortal; and &s;hould in the Time appointed by God, give up the Gho&s;t. But, premi&s;ing all due Regards to tho&s;e from whom I differ in this, I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething to each of the&s;e Hypothe&s;es, that we may the better judge which of them is mo&s;t agreeable to the Scriptures and the Di&s;coveries we have of the Mind of God in them.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, with Re&s;pect to what I hold, I have the&s;e Things to &s;ay.</P>
<P N="1">1. That what I plead for &s;eems much better to agree with the plain Sen&s;e of the Threatning, than that which I di&s;like. The Threat|ning is very expre&s;s and po&s;itive on my Side, and the Terms u&s;ed very &s;trong and emphatical. <HI>In the Day thou eate&s;t thou &s;halt &s;urely die,</HI> or, <HI>&s;hall die the Death.</HI> Now I have already &s;hewed, that a tem|poral or proper Death is intended in the Words, as well as a Death &s;piritual and eternal. And all the Kinds of Death intended were, without Exception, by the Words of the Threatning, to be inflicted on the very Day in which the Crime was committed. Nor have we any Liberty or Licence given us to leave, or recede from, the plain and literal Sen&s;e of God's Word, unle&s;s by &s;ome urgent Nece&s;&s;ity we are compell'd to it. This was the ordinary Sen&s;e in which the Word <HI>Death</HI> was u&s;ed, when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> wrote the Hi&s;tory of Man's Creation and Fall, and no doubt long before that Time. Nor is there any Rea&s;on to doubt but that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> would u&s;e a Word to ex|pre&s;s the Thing intended in the Threatning, in the &s;ame Sen&s;e that God did therein u&s;e it.</P>
<P N="2">2. By <HI>Adam</HI>'s Carriage after he had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed it &s;eems that he ex|pected pre&s;ent Death. When <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> had &s;inned, they were afraid, and hid them&s;elves among the Trees of the Garden, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. ver. 8, and 10. They acted like Per&s;ons that expected to be &s;lain as &s;oon as they &s;hould be taken; and no doubt they did &s;o. And it is not to be que&s;tioned, but that they under&s;tood the Meaning of the Threatning.</P>
<P N="3">3. That God did not immediately execute the&s;e Malefactors, is no Argument at all, that the Sanction of the Law did not intend it, any more than that the Law again&s;t High Trea&s;on does not intend that a Per&s;on committing that Crime, &s;hall be put to Death for it; becau&s;e the King is plea&s;ed to reprieve and pardon him. We may well di&s;tin|gui&s;h between the Meaning of the Law and the Intention of the Prince, who&s;e Law it is. The proper Sen&s;e and Meaning of that Law, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. might be, That our fir&s;t Parents &s;hould die a
<PB N="17" REF="005439_0032_101830a2252c7ac0">
proper Death, on the very Day they &s;inned; and yet upon the In|terpo&s;ition of a Mediator to offer Satisfaction for their Crime, in or|der to their being reconciled to God, they might be reprieved from the pre&s;ent Stroke of Death, and might, in&s;tead thereof, have Con|ditions of Peace propo&s;ed to them. Thus God might be gracious, and &s;ay, <HI>Deliver them from going down into the Pit; I have found a Ran&s;om,</HI> as in Job 33.24. and this I believe was the Ca&s;e. It greatly favours this, that God would pa&s;s no Sentence on our fir&s;t Parents, after they had &s;inned, 'till he had fir&s;t promi&s;ed a Saviour, <HI>the Seed of the Woman</HI> that was to <HI>break the Serpent's Head</HI>; as ap|pears <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15,&mdash;19. Had it not been for this, the&s;e Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors mu&s;t have had quite another Sentence pa&s;&s;ed on them, <HI>viz.</HI> a Sentence of pre&s;ent Death and eternal Damnation.</P>
<P>Some have objected again&s;t what I here plead for, That, on this Hypothe&s;is, the World had at once been deprived of all its humane Inhabitants, tho' it was made for the U&s;e of Mankind: And I readily acknowledge this to be true, and know of no Ab&s;urdity implied in it; for if it had been &s;o, God could ea&s;ily have provided others to fill up the Room of tho&s;e Wretches, who, for &s;inning again&s;t him, had been de&s;troy'd.
<Q>God (&s;aith Dr. <HI>Twi&s;&s;e</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Riches of <HI>GOD's</HI> Love to Ve&s;&s;els of Mercy, <HI>Part 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Page 198.</HI></NOTE>) could have de&s;troyed <HI>Adam</HI> after his Sin, and made another Author of Generation of Man|kind.</Q>
But he never intended it &s;hould come to this. He knew how to &s;ave the Offenders from that pre&s;ent De&s;truction which they de&s;erv'd; and to &s;uffer them, in the Way which he had before pre|&s;cribed to them, to repleni&s;h the Earth with Inhabitants, tho' this was not the Intention of the Threatning before mentioned, in Ca&s;e <HI>Adam</HI> had &s;inned before he had any I&s;&s;ue; and &s;o could not have been done if a Way to &s;atisfy the Law had not been found out.</P>
<P>The Suppo&s;ition which I have endeavoured to defend, being allow'd to be a Truth, as I think it ought to be, it will from thence follow, That if our fir&s;t Parents committed their fir&s;t and great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion before they had any Children, as they certainly did, then no Po&s;terity of theirs could, according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Works, &s;uffer any Pain or Torment, on the Account of their fir&s;t Offence, in eating the forbidden Fruit. The Rea&s;on of this is obvious, <HI>viz.</HI> becau&s;e they could not have any. If they had none before they &s;inned, be&s;ure they could have none afterwards, being to die on that very Day,&mdash;I &s;ay, this follows, according to the Tenor of the Covenant of
<PB N="18" REF="005439_0033_101830a4338fc888">
Works, and &s;uppo&s;ing the Threatning annexed to that Covenant had been executed on the Per&s;ons of the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, according to the genuine Sen&s;e and Meaning of it. For otherwi&s;e they might have, yea, actually had, a numerous I&s;&s;ue, and the&s;e all bro't into the World in a State of Sin and Death, as I &s;hall by and by &s;hew; and by what Means this came to pa&s;s, with the Advantages of allowing that this was brought about in the Way here intended.</P>
<P>But, before I come to this I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that tho' <HI>Adam</HI> could not, on this Suppo&s;ition in&s;i&s;ted on, have had an Off-&s;pring to &s;uffer po&s;itive Pain and Torment on the Account of his fir&s;t Sin; yet he might, by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the Covenant he was then under, hinder an Off-&s;pring, which he &s;hould otherwi&s;e have had, from enjoying very great and good Things, which, had he not &s;inned, they might and &s;hould have enjoyed. Our fir&s;t Parents were by Nature, capable of propagating their Kind, and had not only God's Allowance, but Command and Benediction to that End, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.28. and if they had continued in their Obedience to God, they would mo&s;t certainly have had a large <HI>Off-&s;pring</HI> in the World, all of which would have been brought into it in a very happy E&s;tate, as I have before &s;hewed. Now, by their Sin, they at once hindred both the Being and Happi|ne&s;s of all <HI>the&s;e,</HI> con&s;ider'd with Relation to the Covenant of Works. And thus <HI>the&s;e</HI> were great Loo&s;ers by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, (if I may &s;peak of Not-Beings, as is u&s;ual, in &s;uch Language as we &s;peak of Things that do exi&s;t) They were Loo&s;ers, I &s;ay, by being hinder'd from co|ming into the World, and that in &s;o happy a Condition, as they mu&s;t and would have come into it in, if the Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> had not prevented it. And tho' they could not have complained of this Wrong, if they had never been; yet &s;ince they are bro't into the World by Means of the Mediation of the Son of God, they can &s;ee and complain of the Injury done them by their fir&s;t Parents, in hindring them from being born in a State of Innocency and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>By what has been &s;aid it appears, That <HI>Adam</HI>'s Po&s;terity were, according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Works, much affected one Way or other by his Carriage or Behaviour while he was in a State of Probation. If he had not &s;inned, he would have had an Off-&s;pring who would have been exceeding happy: But by &s;inning a|gain&s;t God, he excluded them (as well as him&s;elf) from that Happi|ne&s;s, which otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t and &s;hould have enjoy'd. He pre|vented them from living a happy Life in this World, and from be|ing Heirs of everla&s;ting Glory in the World to come. Our fir&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="005439_0034_101830a615e12a70">
Parents did, by their fir&s;t and great Offence, virtually cut off all their Off-&s;pring before they were born. As the&s;e virtually &s;inned in them when they &s;inned, &s;o they had virtually died in them (a proper Death I mean) if they had died; tho' the Threatning of the Cove|nant of Works had been executed only on the Per&s;ons of tho&s;e who actually tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Having now briefly con&s;ider'd my own Hypothe&s;is, with the Effects or Con&s;equents of it; I &s;hall proceed a little to examine that which &s;tands in Oppo&s;ition to it, <HI>viz.</HI> That our fir&s;t Parents were not, according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Works, to be immediately put to Death, in Ca&s;e they &s;inned; but were, according to the Nature of that Covenant to be permitted to live &s;ome Time in the World (tho' a very frail and trouble&s;ome Life) and to propagate a numerous I&s;&s;ue of &s;inful Creatures like them&s;elves, and the&s;e all to be brought into the World in a State of Sin, being full of all Enmity and Wicked|ne&s;s, mere incarnate Devils; and being with tho&s;e evil Spirits joined in their Rebellion again&s;t the King of Heaven; being al&s;o with them in utter De&s;pair of any Mercy from God, <HI>bound in Chains of Darkne&s;s to the Judgment of the great Day</HI>; and yet going on to propagate their Kind, great Numbers &s;till dying to make Room for more &s;uch Wretches as them&s;elves, 'till the whole Number of <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;inful Off-&s;pring &s;hould be filled up, and then all of this Race, not one excep|ted, our fir&s;t Parents with all their Po&s;terity, at the final Judg|ment, &s;ent away into everla&s;ting Torment with the Devil and his Angels, as in <HI>Matth.</HI> 25.46. But ob&s;erve, that this &s;uppo&s;eth that there had been no Redeemer provided; and that God had dealt with Man according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Works.</P>
<P>And let it be here con&s;ider'd, that on this Suppo&s;ition, this dread|ful De&s;truction of all the Po&s;terity of <HI>Adam</HI> mu&s;t have been wholly owing to that one Offence of his, in eating the forbidden Fruit; which yet the&s;e Sufferers could no Ways have po&s;&s;ibly prevented, or have &s;aved them&s;elves from the Guilt of, for they, in their own Per|&s;ons, neither did nor could give their Con&s;ent to the Terms of the Covenant made with their great Progenitor; nor could they hinder his &s;inning as he did, or any of the woful Con&s;equences of his &s;o do|ing; &s;o that the whole would have been, as to them, unavoidable.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e it will not be denied, that this mu&s;t have been the Ca&s;e of all <HI>Adam</HI>'s Po&s;terity, on the Suppo&s;ition which I call in que&s;tion. Now this is to many a very great Stumbling-block, or Matter of
<PB N="20" REF="005439_0035_101830aae81b97e8">
Offence; and tho' what is by <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> offered in Defence of it de|&s;erves &s;erious Con&s;ideration, yet I am inclin'd to think, that the Imputation of <HI>Adam</HI>'s fir&s;t Offence to his Off-&s;pring may be better defended on the Hypothe&s;is which I have advanced, than on that which I am not well &s;atisfied with: And therefore I have cho&s;en that which I endeavour to defend; and will e&s;&s;ay a little more fully to clear it up.</P>
<P>I take it for granted, That the Covenant of Works was, in the Nature of it, a very gracious Covenant, a Covenant in which the Goodne&s;s of God was very greatly di&s;covered; and &s;o a Covenant the Ju&s;tice whereof might be vindicated again&s;t all Objections that might po&s;&s;ibly be made again&s;t it, tho' God had in&s;i&s;ted on the Terms of it, without abating one Jot or Tittle of its Demands, or admitting a Spon&s;or to make Satisfaction on Behalf of the Offenders again&s;t it; and therefore that Cour&s;e in which this may be be&s;t done, and the Honour of God's Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s mo&s;t clearly and ea&s;ily vindi|cated, I think to be the mo&s;t eligible, Care being &s;till taken that this be not attempted in any Way incon&s;i&s;tent with any other divine Truth what&s;oever. Now this I hope, the Way I have taken is &s;uited to; and that I may further &s;hew that it is &s;o, I will mention &s;ome of the happy Con&s;equences following on what I plead for.</P>
<P>But before I do this, I think it needful to &s;hew, what does not follow from it, at lea&s;t that one Thing does not, which perhaps &s;ome may &s;u&s;pect does, I mean that it does not follow, on the Suppo&s;ition for which I plead, That <HI>Adam</HI>'s fir&s;t and great Offence is not imputed to his Po&s;terity. Could I think that &s;uch a Con&s;equence would fol|low on it, I &s;hould not ea&s;ily admit it.</P>
<P>Tho' it be maintain'd to be a Truth, that according to the Tenor of the Covenant which God made with <HI>Adam, Gen.</HI> 2.17. his Off-&s;pring (if he &s;hould have any) were to &s;uffer Death, as well as him&s;elf and his Wife, in Ca&s;e of his &s;inning in eating the forbidden Fruit; yet this notwith&s;tanding it might be a Truth, that, according to the Tenor of that Covenant, our fir&s;t Parents were to be put to Death, on that very Day in which they &s;inned, tho' that &s;hould fall out, as it did, while they had no I&s;&s;ue. It is certain by the Event, that our fir&s;t Parents were liable to &s;in before they had any Children: And I think it al&s;o evident, that God did not any Ways oblige him&s;elf by his Word, to give them a Po&s;terity, in Ca&s;e they &s;inned before they had I&s;&s;ue: Nay, on the contrary, I think it evident from what has
<PB N="21" REF="005439_0036_101830acb68b8fe0">
been &s;aid before, that they were to die on the very Day in which they &s;hould eat of the forbidden Tree. Now if this be granted, it will not follow from it that if a Way were found out to redeem the&s;e Offenders from pre&s;ent Death and Damnation, &s;o that they might live and have an Off-&s;pring in the World, that then the Children pro|ceeding from them, after they were become guilty, and their Natures depraved by Sin, &s;hould not be involved in the &s;ame Sin and Death, which they them&s;elves were involved in. This, I &s;ay, will by no Means follow, on the Suppo&s;ition mentioned. If they proceed from <HI>Adam,</HI> in the Way of ordinary Generation, they mu&s;t &s;till, accor|ding to the Tenor of the Covenant made with him for him&s;elf and Off-&s;pring, (if any he &s;hould have) be brought into the World in a State of Sin and Death, the Condition he was in after his Fall.</P>
<P>Having now &s;hew'd what does not follow on the Hypothe&s;is pleaded for, I &s;hall proceed to &s;hew what does follow from it.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. It plainly followeth from what I would have granted, That none had ever &s;uffered any Pain or Torment, for Man's fir&s;t and great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, had the Threatning denounced in the Covenant of Works, been, in it's utmo&s;t Rigour, executed on the Breakers of it, but only tho&s;e who per&s;onally &s;inn'd in eating the forbidden Fruit. This Con&s;equence is mo&s;t evident; becau&s;e, if that Sentence of Death had been executed on <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> according to the true Sen&s;e and Meaning of it, on the Day wherein they &s;inned, there could not have been any others to bear the Puni&s;hment with them, there being none to &s;uffer be&s;ides them&s;elves: For the&s;e &s;inning before they had any I&s;&s;ue, mu&s;t needs, according to the Tenor of the Co|venant they were under, have died without any I&s;&s;ue as before. I know God the great Law-giver, did not intend it &s;hould be thus; the Event &s;hews the contrary: But this, for ought any thing I can yet &s;ee, was the meaning of the Threatning in the Covenant; &s;o that the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of it, could ju&s;tly expect no other, on their breaking of it; and I &s;uppo&s;e they did not, tho' God found out a Way to &s;pare them. It is therefore, I &s;uppo&s;e, a Mi&s;take, tho' many have fallen into it, That if there had been no Mediator provided, to undertake the Work of Man's Redemption, there would have been many Mil|lions of People, be&s;ides <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> who only per&s;onally tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t Covenant, who mu&s;t have &s;uffered the Vengeance of eternal Fire, for their Sin, in eating the forbidden Fruit: They could have had no Po&s;terity to have &s;uffered, if no Mediator had been pro|vided.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="005439_0037_101830af22c605f8">Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. It plainly followeth, on the Hypothe&s;is in&s;i&s;ted on, That all the Po&s;terity of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> are obliged to our great Mediator for their very Being in the World. Had not a Mediator interpo&s;ed, and ob|tained a Reprieve for our fir&s;t Parents, they mu&s;t have been put to Death on the very Day in which they &s;inned; and then none of their Off-&s;pring could ever have had a Being. They might, and doubtle&s;s would, have had a numerous and happy I&s;&s;ue, had they not &s;inn'd; but by &s;inning again&s;t God while yet they were without any, they forfeited the Ble&s;&s;ing of Po&s;terity, yea forfeited their own Lives, and mu&s;t have died Child-le&s;s, if the Son of God had not undertaken to be a Redeemer, born of a Woman, and made a Sacrifice for them; and then we, who are now their Off-&s;pring, &s;hould never have &s;een the Light, but &s;hould have been, as it were, cut off before we had any per&s;onal Sub&s;i&s;tence, tho' virtually we did exi&s;t in the&s;e Per|&s;ons, in whom the whole humane Nature was then compri&s;ed: So that if they had been immediately cut off, we had virtually been cut off in them, as virtually we &s;inned in them, while per&s;onally we did not exi&s;t. It is therefore manife&s;t, on the Suppo&s;ition in&s;i&s;ted on, that we are all beholden to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as Mediator betwixt God and Man, for our very Being and Sub&s;i&s;tence on the Earth. Had it not been for his Undertaking to be a Saviour, we &s;hould never have been.</P>
<P N="3">3. It further followeth, on the Hypothe&s;is here in&s;i&s;ted on, That our fir&s;t Parents, and all their Po&s;terity, did, by Means of the Inter|po&s;ition of a Mediator to redeem and &s;ave them, immediately become Subjects of his mediatorial Kingdom. Mankind had, 'till then, been held fa&s;t under a Covenant of Works, to be dealt with according to the Tenor of that Covenant; but now the Son of God, (having been appointed a Mediator fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Eternity) was promi&s;ed to be a Saviour, in <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15. and &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cree was declar'd, as in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 2.7. and his Undertaking this glorious Work reveal'd; and began to have its proper Efficacy, he being <HI>the Lamb</HI> virtually <HI>&s;lain from the Foundation of the World.</HI> Not that Mankind were hereby immediately di&s;charg'd from the Guilt of Sin, and entitled to eternal Life; for they remained &s;till &s;ubject to the Penalty threatned in the broken Covenant of Works, 'till &s;omething might be farther done for them, pur&s;uant to the menti|oned Undertaking of the Redeemer. But what I intend, is, that they immediately became rightful Subjects of that Kingdom which the Son of God had, as Mediator, committed to him, and which he was afterwards to deliver up to his Father, as in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.24. It was by paying the Price of Man's Redemption, that our Lord obtained &s;uch
<PB N="23" REF="005439_0038_101830b5676b08b0">
a Right to rule and govern all tho&s;e, by his Laws and Ordinances, who are the Objects of his Purcha&s;e: And all the Laws given to Mankind &s;ince the Fall, are properly the Laws of the Mediator, by him given to them, the Price of who&s;e Redemption he undertook to pay, and in due Time did &s;o, according to his Covenant with his Fa|ther: And according to the&s;e Laws of his, he actually governs the World, ble&s;&s;ing and rewarding the Obedient, and puni&s;hing the Di&s;|obedient, as is in the holy Scriptures abundantly declared. As for the Covenant of Works, that being once broken, Mankind &s;tood in no other Relation to it than this, that they mu&s;t undergo the Puni&s;h|ment threatned in it, unle&s;s in &s;ome Way con&s;i&s;tent with the Tenor of it, they might obtain a Di&s;charge therefrom. God never after the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> propos'd the Covenant of Works to &s;inful Men, as a Way in which they might obtain eternal Life; tho' he has &s;ome|times given them a Repre&s;entation of the Nature and Tenor of that Covenant, that he might convince them how impo&s;&s;ible it is to ob|tain Happine&s;s by Obedience to it, as in <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10,&mdash;12. Yet &s;incere Obedience to the moral Law is required in the new Covenant, and is, according to the Nature and Tenor of it, nece&s;&s;ary to Man's Happine&s;s: <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.14.</P>
<P N="4">4. It followeth, on the Hypothe&s;is for which I plead, That all <HI>Adam</HI>'s Off-&s;pring are bro't into the World in a &s;alvable Condition. In &s;uch a Condition, I mean, as that, in a Way con&s;i&s;tent with di|vine Ju&s;tice, and the Tenor of the fir&s;t Covenant, they may be eter|nally &s;aved. Nor do I intend this in &s;uch a Sen&s;e only, as wherein the &s;ame may be verified concerning &s;inful Mankind, before (if I may &s;o &s;peak) a Ran&s;om was found for them, becau&s;e it was in the Power of God to find out and provide a Way for their Salvation; which, if he could not have done, no Sinner could ever have been &s;aved.</P>
<P>But I here intend to &s;peak of a nearer Capacity of Salvation, on the Account of a Price already paid or promi&s;ed to be paid, for their Re|demption. For by the &s;ame Means that our great Mediator procured a Reprieve for fallen Mankind, that they might not, on their &s;inning again&s;t God, be immediately de&s;troy'd, he al&s;o made Way for their eternal Salvation, <HI>i. e.</HI> by paying a full Price for their Redemption, a Price every Way &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the Demands of the Law, and to &s;atisfy God for the Injury done to him: And whereas the Price was not immediately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">id down when Man fir&s;t &s;inned and broke Cove|nant with God; the Security given for the Payment of this Price,
<PB N="24" REF="005439_0039_101830b95c15c9f0">
was &s;uch as the ble&s;&s;ed God was as well &s;atisfied with, as if the &s;ame had been immediately and actually paid. There was no Occa&s;ion to &s;eek any farther for a Ran&s;om or Atonement for the Sin of Man|kind. Any Man might now be &s;aved, without any other or further Price of Redemption; and there was now a Foundation laid for a Treaty of Peace betwixt God and &s;inful Men; and &s;uch Terms might now be propos'd to them, as they complying with, might be ju&s;tified and &s;aved, without doing any Injury to God's Ju&s;tice, as the Apo&s;tle fully declareth in <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.25, 26. Thus much Dr. <HI>Twi&s;&s;e,</HI> and many of our Engli&s;h Divines of great Note, and not &s;u&s;pected as in|clined to <HI>Arminiani&s;m,</HI> have granted and maintained, as I can &s;hew if Occa&s;ion call for it. And le&s;s than this cannot rea&s;onably be allow'd to be intended in &s;uch Texts of Scripture, wherein the Extent of Chri&s;t's Death, with Relation to the Object of it, is a&s;&s;erted; as in <HI>John</HI> 3.16. 1 <HI>John</HI> 2.2. <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.9. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.14, 15. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 53.6. and <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 5.18, 19.</P>
<P N="5">5. It followeth from the Premi&s;es, That all <HI>Adam</HI>'s Po&s;terity are brought into the World in a far better E&s;tate, than that of Not-Being. Tho' I agree not with them who think that a State of end|le&s;s Torment is better than that of having no Being at all; yet I prefer a State of Salvability from a State of Sin and Death, which &s;uch as may be &s;aved are at pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ed to be under, to that of Not-Being. Suppo&s;ing I am not yet pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life, and that I am not certain that I ever &s;hall; yet &s;ince there is a Way found out, in which I may be &s;aved, <HI>i. e.</HI> not only delivered from Sin and Death, but al&s;o obtain an exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory, I &s;hould be loth to change my pre&s;ent State for that of having no Being at all. And Per&s;ons capable of propagating their Kind, or of being In&s;truments of bringing Children into the World, may very rea&s;onably de&s;ire to multiply their Kind, tho' they are per&s;uaded that all that proceed from them, in the Way of ordinary Generation, will come into the World in a State of Guilt and Corruption; nor do I &s;ee that God does any Wrong, in bringing <HI>Adam</HI>'s Po&s;terity into the World, tho' they do and mu&s;t come into it (if at all) in a State of Guilt and Pollution, as has been expre&s;&s;ed, &s;ince it is better for them to be, tho' in &s;uch a Condition, than to have no Being: Which will yet more fully appear by the Sequel of this E&s;&s;ay. We may there|fore, without any Inconvenience, allow unto <HI>Arminians</HI> that which &s;ome of them affirm, <HI>viz.</HI> That it will not &s;tand with the Ju&s;tice of God, to bring Mankind into the World in a wor&s;e State than that of Not-Being.
<PB N="25" REF="005439_0040_101830be505b4950">
I know of no Advantage that any of the Enemies of the Grace of God can make of &s;uch a Conce&s;&s;ion as this is.</P>
<P>But it may be here objected, That <HI>to be a Sinner &s;eems to be a wor&s;e E&s;tate than that of having no Being. We had better have no Being at all, than to be in a State of Sin and Enmity again&s;t God, &s;uch as all Mankind are by Nature in, or as they come into the World, if the Doctrine of original Sin be a true Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, That thus to &s;ay is to beg the great Thing in que&s;tion. It &s;eems that a wi&s;e and holy God has thought otherwi&s;e. If he, in his infinite Wi&s;dom, had not &s;een it <HI>better</HI> that all Mankind &s;hould, by his Permi&s;&s;ion, fall into a State of Sin and Death than not, why has he permitted them to fall into that E&s;tate? And if it had not been better for us to <HI>exi&s;t,</HI> tho' in a State of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;ery,</HI> rather than <HI>not</HI> to come into <HI>Being</HI> at all, why did he give to fallen <HI>Adam</HI> a <HI>Po&s;terity?</HI> when he might very con&s;i&s;tently with the Covenant and with Ju&s;tice have in&s;tantly cut him off before he had any I&s;&s;ue; and when, if <HI>Adam</HI> had an Off-&s;pring, they mu&s;t needs be involved with him in Sin and Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But when I &s;ay, that &s;uch an E&s;tate is to be preferred to that of Not-Being, I &s;peak of what is be&s;t for Mankind, the Subjects here di&s;cours'd of. Nor do I here Con&s;ider a State of Sin ab&s;tractly, without taking into the Con&s;ideration of Man's E&s;tate, the Means and Advantages afforded unto Sinners, in order to their getting out of it, and getting into a Condition infinitely to be de&s;ired.</P>
<P>If it be here further objected, That <HI>it &s;eems not con&s;i&s;tent with the Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s of God, to puni&s;h</HI> Adam<HI>'s Po&s;terity with Sin, for that Sin which he committed</HI>;</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, That if <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin be ju&s;tly imputed to his Po&s;terity, &s;o that they ju&s;tly bear the Puni&s;hment of it, which I now take for granted, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why they may not be puni&s;hed in this Way, as con&s;i&s;tently with the Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s of God, as if the Sin, for which they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o puni&s;hed, were committed by them in their own Per&s;ons; as in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> them|&s;elves, and many others that might be named.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be here &s;aid, That <HI>the Sin of a publick Per&s;on, or moral Head and Repre&s;entative, cannot be &s;o imputed to the Per&s;ons repre&s;ented by him, as to become their's, in the &s;ame &s;trict Sen&s;e as it would be, if they in' Per&s;on had committed it</HI>;</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="005439_0041_101830c05e09f8d0">I grant this to be true; and as we mu&s;t not &s;ay, That our Sins imputed to Chri&s;t, were his, by Means of that Imputation, in the &s;ame Sen&s;e in which they were our's, who committed them: So nei|ther is <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin imputed to us, by that Imputation made our's, in the &s;ame Sen&s;e in which it was his.&mdash;Yet that Sin and Fault of his was &s;o our's, that we ju&s;tly bear the Puni&s;hment of it, being for it liable to the &s;ame Death as he him&s;elf was.</P>

(2) Tho' Sin, by which the mi&s;erable State we are in has been bro't on us, was not committed by our own Per&s;ons; yet was it committed by Per&s;ons &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in our Nature, and &s;o is, in &s;ome Sort, the Sin of all Mankind, in the Way of ordinary Generation proceeding from <HI>Adam,</HI> their natural, as well as moral and political Head. And therefore, (3) We have no Rea&s;on to think or imagine, that had we, in our own Per&s;ons, been put on the &s;ame Trial as our common Head, in our Room and Stead, was, we &s;hould have done any better for our &s;elves than he has done for us. (4) Tho' we cannot lament and bewail that as a Crime which we have committed in our own Per|&s;ons, which we have not &s;o committed; yet we may lament the Sin committed in our Nature, by our moral Head and Repre&s;entative.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Concerning that <HI>Salvation</HI> which Sinners are &s;uppo&s;ed to have offered to them in the Go&s;pel.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING in the foregoing Chapter con&s;ider'd the <HI>State</HI> of Sin and Mi&s;ery, which Sinners are in, to whom the Offer of Salvation is &s;uppo&s;ed to be made in the Go&s;pel; we &s;hall now the more ea&s;ily conceive wherein that Salvation does con&s;i&s;t, which the&s;e are &s;uppo&s;ed to have an Offer of; to declare which is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Chapter.</P>
<P>And to this I &s;ay in general, That this Salvation does con&s;i&s;t in Man's Deliverance from that E&s;tate of Sin and Death, which I have already de&s;cribed, together with his Enjoyment of tho&s;e good Things, of which they only are made Partakers, who are delivered from the forementioned Evils; and who are made happy in the Enjoyment of God for ever. Man's Salvation does, indeed, mo&s;t properly con&s;i&s;t in his Deliverance from all tho&s;e Evils, which his Sin and Apo&s;tacy from God has brought upon him; but it does al&s;o, by a <HI>Synecdoche,</HI> contain and compri&s;e in it all tho&s;e good Things which they, and only they, have be&s;towed on them, who &s;hall be crown'd with endle&s;s Happine&s;s in the Kingdom of Glory. It is call'd <HI>eternal Salvation,</HI> Heb. 5.9. and <HI>Salvation with eternal Glory,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.10. and very frequently <HI>eternal Life,</HI> as in John 3.15, 10.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="005439_0043_101830c5d55aa8d8">This Salvation compri&s;eth or includeth in it &s;everal Things, &s;ome of the principal of which may be here briefly nam'd and con&s;idered.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. This Salvation compri&s;eth in it, Man's Deliverance from the Guilt of all his Sins, and his being made righteous by the perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t imputed to him. Indeed this &s;eems not, in &s;o &s;trict and proper a Sen&s;e, to belong to Man's Salvation, as the other Things hereafter named. Strictly and properly &s;peaking, a Man is rather by this entitled to Salvation, than actually &s;aved. As Sin was not the Death threatned in the fir&s;t Covenant, but the me|ritorious or procuring Cau&s;e of it, Man thereby lo&s;ing or falling &s;hort of that perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s, on which his Title to Life did depend; &s;o when a Man is made perfectly righteous, by having the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t imputed to him, this is not properly the Life it &s;elf promi&s;ed to tho&s;e that believe, but that by which they have a Right and Title to that Life; for of that none are ever made Partakers, without fir&s;t having a perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s, by which they come to have a Right and Title to it. Hence it was that <HI>Paul</HI> was &s;o &s;olici|tous that he might be found in Chri&s;t, having on his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.8, 9. even the &s;ame Righteou&s;ne&s;s that is &s;aid to be <HI>unto and upon them that believe,</HI> Rom. 3.22. and which is &s;aid to be <HI>imputed without Works,</HI> Rom. 4.6. It may moreover be here ob&s;erved, that the Imputation of Righteou&s;ne&s;s to us does not make any <HI>real</HI> Change in our Condition, but a <HI>relative</HI> Change only. As when a condemn'd Malefactor is pardon'd, &s;o that the Law has nothing to lay to his Charge, this does not of it &s;elf &s;et him free from his Pri&s;on and Chains, but only makes Way for it. He remains &s;till in Hold, and bears the Burthen of his afflicted State, it may be, in a filthy Dungeon, 'till &s;omething farther be done for him, <HI>i. e.</HI> 'till he have a Goal-Delivery.</P>
<P>This notwith&s;tanding, the Guilt of Sin being the Ground of all the Mi&s;ery that follows on it, it may, on that Account, be looked on as a great Part of their Mi&s;ery that lie under it, being that by which they are bound over to eternal De&s;truction, and excluded from eternal Happine&s;s. Now on this Account, Men's Deliverance from the Guilt of Sin may be reckoned as belonging to that Salvation, which is in the Go&s;pel offered to them; and therefore the Scriptures both of the old and new Te&s;tament, do abound with conditional Pro|mi&s;es of Remi&s;&s;ion of Sin, in which a Promi&s;e of eternal Life and Salvation is always implied; becau&s;e eternal Life always follows For|givene&s;s and Ju&s;tification in God's Sight. See <HI>Acts</HI> 10.43. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 32.1, 2. <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.6, 7, 8. Chri&s;t's &s;aving his People from their Sins, doubtle&s;s comprehendeth his delivering them from the Guilt of them.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="29" REF="005439_0044_101830c96195b7a0">2. The Salvation offered in the Go&s;pel compri&s;eth al&s;o in it, Men's Deliverance from the Power and Dominion of Sin in them. And in Nothing that can be thought of, does the Salvation of Sinners more properly and eminently con&s;i&s;t, than in this. All Men are, by Nature, Servants of Sin, wholly under the Dominion of it. Every <HI>Imagination of the Thoughts of their Hearts being only evil continually,</HI> Gen. 6.5. Their Hearts are evil from their Youth. What Ser|vants and Slaves of Sin, Men in their natural E&s;tate, are, the Scrip|tures largely expre&s;s, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 14.1,&mdash;4. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 36.1,&mdash;4. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.9,&mdash;18. and el&s;ewhere, as we have &s;een, in Part, in the foregoing Chapter; as al&s;o how this comes to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>But now Men's Deliverance from this Servitude and Slavery mu&s;t needs be one great Part of that Salvation, which Je&s;us Chri&s;t came to work for them, when he came into the World to <HI>&s;ave his People from their Sins,</HI> as in <HI>Matth.</HI> 1.21. Of Men's Deliverance out of this E&s;tate the Apo&s;tle treats largely, <HI>Rom.</HI> Chap. 6. e&s;pecially from Ver&s;e 16 to the 22d, of which Di&s;cour&s;e we have the Sum and Con|clu&s;ion in the la&s;t Ver&s;e referred to, viz. <HI>being now made free from Sin, and become Servants to God, ye have your Fruit unto Holine&s;s, and in the End everla&s;ting Life.</HI> With which Words does well agree what we have in Eph. 2.1, 2. <HI>You hath he quickned, who were dead in Tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and Sins.</HI> Now, it is in the great Work of Regeneration that Men are thus &s;aved from the Power and Dominion of Sin: Nothing &s;hort of this will effectually accompli&s;h it. For this that Text is plain and full, Tit. 3.5. <HI>Not by Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, but according to his Mercy hath be &s;aved us, by the Wa&s;hing of Re|generation, and the Renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> When Per&s;ons are &s;aid to be &s;aved <HI>by the Wa&s;hing of Regeneration,</HI> this means, that their Salvation does formally con&s;i&s;t in this: Not that this is the Condition required; for that it is not, but one great Part of that Salvation which is conditionally offered to us, I &s;hall hereafter &s;hew. Indeed our Salvation does not more, or more properly, con&s;i&s;t in any Thing, than in Regeneration; call'd in Scripture, our being <HI>created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works,</HI> Eph. 2.10. and our being <HI>delivered from the Power of Darkne&s;s, and tran&s;lated into the Kingdom of God's dear Son,</HI> Col. 1.13. al&s;o our being, by Chri&s;t, <HI>redeemed from all Iniquity, and purified unto him&s;elf a peculiar People, zealous of Good Works,</HI> Tit. 2.14. This is indeed the Quickning of &s;uch as are dead, <HI>dead in Sin and in the Uncircumci&s;ion of their Fle&s;h</HI>; as in the&s;e Texts of Scrip|ture does appear, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.14. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.1. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.13. Thus all true Saints are <HI>&s;aved and called with a holy Calling,</HI> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 1.9. And herein God manife&s;ts the exceeding Greatne&s;s of his Power to|wards
<PB N="30" REF="005439_0045_101830cec66705d8">
them that believe, <HI>according to the Working of his mighty Power which wrought in Chri&s;t when he rai&s;ed him from the dead.</HI> When this is done for Sinners, they are therein &s;aved.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Salvation under Con&s;ideration compri&s;eth in it, Men's Deliverance from the Power, Rule and Government of their &s;piritual Enemies. When Mankind fir&s;t &s;inned again&s;t God, they ca&s;t off their Allegiance to their rightful Sovereign, and &s;ubjected them&s;elves to the Government of the Devil, and became his Slaves and Va&s;&s;als, who de&s;igning their utter and eternal Ruin, by his Enticements, pre|vail'd again&s;t them, <HI>Gen.</HI> Chap. 3. and took them <HI>captive at his Will,</HI> and &s;till rules over all &s;uch as are not delivered out of his Snare. Now this <HI>Prince of Devils</HI> does, by his <HI>Legions</HI> of evil Angels, that attend on him, as <HI>the Prince of the Power of the Air,</HI> &s;till work <HI>in the Children of Di&s;obedience,</HI> tempting and over-coming all &s;uch as belong to <HI>the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s</HI>; and finally de&s;troys all &s;uch as are not delivered out of his Hands.</P>
<P>Now in Men's Deliverance out of the Hands of this Enemy, (or rather, all the&s;e Enemies) does their Salvation very much con&s;i&s;t. And this their Deliverance was mo&s;t expre&s;ly foretold, yea ingaged, in that Promi&s;e given immediately after Man's Fall, Gen. 3.15. That <HI>the Seed of the Woman &s;hould break the Serpent's Head</HI>: By his doing of which, the Seed of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> were to be &s;et at Liberty, when that glorious Promi&s;e &s;hould be fulfilled, in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 53.10, 11, 12. and <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 49.24, 25. which Prophecies were accompli&s;hed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the Days of his Fle&s;h; and the Prai&s;e of God was, on that Account, celebrated at his Appearance in our Nature, by <HI>Zecharias,</HI> in his Song, <HI>Luke</HI> Chap. 1. Ver&s;e 67,&mdash;74. who being filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, prophe&s;ied and &s;aid, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>for he hath vi&s;ited and redeemed his People, and hath rai&s;ed up an Horn of Salvation for us, in the Hou&s;e of his Servant</HI> David; <HI>as he &s;pake by the Mouth of his holy Prophets, which have been &s;ince the World began; that we &s;hould be &s;aved from our Enemies, and from the Hand of all that hate us. To perform the Mercy promi&s;ed to our Fathers, and to remember his holy Covenant: The Oath which he &s;ware to our Father</HI> Abraham, <HI>that he will grant us, that we being delivered out of the Hands of all our Enemies, might &s;erve him without Fear,</HI> &amp;c. The Price of this Redemption was paid by our Redeemer, when he pour'd out his Soul unto Death, and was number'd with the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;peaks, in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> Chap. 53. before quoted. And Sinners are actually freed from the Dominion of the Enemies of their
<PB N="31" REF="005439_0046_101830d3d2f0b970">
Souls, when being made Partakers of the Graces of God's Spirit, they are made &s;trong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might; enabled to wre&s;tle with, and overcome, the Rulers of the Dark|ne&s;s of this World, as is expre&s;&s;ed at large in <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.10. and onwards to Ver&s;e 18.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Salvation offered to Sinners in the Go&s;pel, does al&s;o com|pri&s;e in it, their Per&s;everance in true Faith and Holine&s;s unto the End of their Lives. Per&s;everance in true Faith and Holine&s;s, is not the Condition on which eternal Salvation is offered; as if our Salva|tion was &s;u&s;pended on our <HI>Per&s;everance</HI>: But on the contrary, <HI>it</HI> is contained and engaged in the Promi&s;e of Salvation made to every true Believer. Every true Believer, or regenerate Saint, has already <HI>eternal Life, and &s;hall not come into Condemnation, but is pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life,</HI> Joh. 5.24. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1. Such an one has already performed the Condition, on which Salvation is promi&s;ed to him: Therefore his Per&s;everance un|to the End belongs to his Salvation, and is &s;ecured to him in the Pro|mi&s;e&mdash;And how &s;hould the &s;ame Thing belong both to the Salvation promi&s;ed, and the Condition of the Promi&s;e? &mdash; I hope in this, I &s;hall meet with no Oppo&s;ition from <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI>: And with <HI>Arminians</HI> my direct De&s;ign is not to di&s;pute. And I affirm, That there is no Text of Scripture, wherein eternal Salvation is conditionally promi&s;ed, but what promi&s;eth Per&s;everance to the End, without which Men neither are, nor can be, eternally &s;aved. But be&s;ides this, there be many other more expre&s;s Promi&s;es made to the Faithful, (at lea&s;t plainly implied in the Texts intended) of Per&s;everance to the End. Among many &s;uch they who plea&s;e may &s;ee <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.38, 39, 40. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 40.28,&mdash; 31. al&s;o Chap. 41.10, 13, 14. and Chap. 49.14, 15, 16. al&s;o Chap. 54.6,&mdash;10. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 125.1, 2.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Salvation of &s;inful Men does, in Part, con&s;i&s;t in their com|pleat Deliverance from Sin and all Temptations to Sin, in the Mo|ment of their Death. Notwith&s;tanding Men's Deliverance from the reigning Power of Sin and Satan, in their Regeneration and Pre&s;erva|tion from the de&s;tructive Influences of the&s;e Enemies, in their Per&s;e|verance, they are not wholly freed from indwelling Sin, and Tempta|tions to Sin during this Life. While they are here in a militant State, Sin and Satan are &s;uffered to mole&s;t and annoy them, and &s;ometimes, in particular Conflicts, to prevail again&s;t them, and put them to the wor&s;e. The Condition of God's Children, with Re&s;pect hereunto, is fully and clearly expre&s;s'd by the Apo&s;tle, in <HI>Rom.</HI> Chap. 7. Ver. 14. and onwards to the End, and <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.17. But at the Moment
<PB N="32" REF="005439_0047_101830d55f9799c8">
of the Death of the true Children of God, they are perfectly freed from any further Mole&s;tations from, or by the&s;e Enemies, being made then perfectly holy and removed out of their Reach. They are then taken from <HI>the Evil</HI> that is here, and <HI>enter into Peace, dying in the Lord, and re&s;ting in their Beds, each One walking in his Uprightne&s;s,</HI> I&s;ai. 57.1, 2. <HI>They re&s;t from their Labours, and their Works follow them,</HI> Rev. 14.13. their Spirits then being made perfect, in Re&s;pect of their Freedom from Sin. They are prepared for, and convey'd to, the Society and Communion of the Saints in Light, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.22, 23.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Salvation offered in the Go&s;pel comprehendeth in it, Man's Deliverance from his la&s;t Enemy, which is Death, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.26. Death is certainly an Enemy to Mankind. Humane Nature &s;hrinks at it: It is called <HI>the King of Terrors,</HI> Job 18.14. It is <HI>the Wages of Sin,</HI> Rom. 6.23. <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.19. tho' our Saviour hath taken away the Sting of Death, which is Sin, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.55, 56.</P>
<P>But at the Re&s;urrection of the Ju&s;t, this Enemy &s;hall be removed, when the dead Bodies of God's Saints &s;hall be rai&s;ed, and <HI>this Cor|ruption &s;hall put on Incorruption, and this Mortal &s;hall put on Immortality,</HI> as in 1 Cor. 15.54, 55. and when <HI>our vile Bodies &s;hall be changed, and fa&s;hioned like to the glorious Body of Chri&s;t,</HI> Phil. 3.21.</P>
<P N="7">7. Man's Salvation, now under Con&s;ideration, does comprehend and include in it, his being put in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Glory and Happi|ne&s;s which the Saints &s;hall enjoy in the heavenly World for ever, when the great Judge of the World &s;hall &s;ay to the Sheep on his right Hand, as in Matth. 25.34. <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be feared that &s;ome, when they talk of Salvation, intend only this Part of it la&s;t mentioned, without duly con&s;idering the other foregoing, and with Re&s;pect to this, pre-requi&s;ite Parts of Man's Salvation, e&s;pecially Man's Salvation from Sin. But what God has joined together, we &s;hould not &s;eparate in our Minds. The &s;even Things mentioned all belong to that Salvation which is offered in the Go&s;pel. God gives none of them to any one to whom he gives them not all.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Shewing what is imported in Salvation's be|ing offered.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING con&s;idered what is intended by that Salvation which, I &s;ay, is offered to Sinners in the Go&s;pel; it is nece&s;&s;ary that I now proceed to con&s;ider what is intended by an <HI>Offer</HI> of it.</P>

<P>But, in the Offer of Salvation made to Sinners in the Go&s;pel, the Thing propos'd to be done by &s;inful Men is propo&s;ed as a <HI>Duty,</HI> which they are under indi&s;pen&s;ible Obligations to perform; becau&s;e the Thing is required by God of them; and therefore nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e they cannot be &s;aved without it.</P>
<P>That which is required of &s;inful Men, in order to their Salvation, may, for ought I can yet &s;ee, be very fitly called the <HI>Condition</HI> on which Salvation is offered to them. I readily acknowledge, that there are &s;everal Sorts of <HI>Conditions,</HI> differing very con&s;iderably one from another; of which Differences I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion hereafter to &s;ay &s;omething: For it is very nece&s;&s;ary that we rightly under&s;tand what Kind of Condition <HI>that</HI> is, on which Salvation is &s;aid to be offered; but doubtle&s;s we may allow, that the Thing required may be called a <HI>Condition,</HI> and &s;o I intend to call it in this Di&s;cour&s;e; and I hope it will, in the I&s;&s;ue, appear, that no hurtful Con&s;equences will attend its being &s;o accounted and called.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="005439_0049_101830d9edc88cf0">In this which I call the <HI>Condition</HI> on which Salvation is offered, I comprehend and include every Thing that is required of Man, as indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary in order to his Salvation, &s;o that God will not &s;ave him without his doing it; and unto his doing of which a Pro|mi&s;e of Salvation is annex'd. To be &s;ure, if there be any Thing which if a Man will not do God will not &s;ave him, that Thing mu&s;t be under|&s;tood as compri&s;ed in the Condition of Man's Salvation; and unto whom|&s;oever a Promi&s;e of Salvation is made in God's holy Word, the Thing being to be done in order to our Salvation, that Thing is compri&s;ed in the Condition required. &mdash; It matters not whether all &s;o required be con&s;idered as one Condition, or as many, their Conditionality in this Affair being &s;till affirmed: But if we &s;peak of this as one Condition; as I u&s;ually do, then what is more particularly compri&s;ed therein, ought to be di&s;tinctly con&s;idered and declared, by what Name &s;oever &s;uch Things are called, as <HI>Faith, Repentance, Obedience, &s;eeking the Lord, calling on him, coming to Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. And it doubtle&s;s com|prehends all the&s;e Things in it, as I &s;hall hereafter &s;hew, removing &s;uch Objections as are apt to be made again&s;t it.</P>
<P>And whereas all Mankind may be divided into two Sorts, or People of two different Conditions, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;uch as are in a regene|rate and ju&s;tified E&s;tate, and &s;uch as are not, but in a State of Na|ture, under the Wrath and Cur&s;e of God, and &s;o liable to eternal Damnation: it will certainly be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider which of the&s;e two E&s;tates Sinners mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be in, when they perform the Condition, on which God offers to &s;ave them: And this &s;eems to me to be an ea&s;y Que&s;tion, but &s;ince many have, in this, a different Way of Thinking from me, this is to be particularly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the &s;econd Part of this E&s;&s;ay, altho' it &s;eems well nigh put out of Que&s;|tion, in the &s;econd Chapter of this.</P>
<P>That what is required of &s;inful Men in order to their Ju&s;tification and Salvation, is well called by the Name of <HI>Faith,</HI> I very freely acknowledge; and that it is very frequently &s;o called in Scripture is to me evident: But that it is al&s;o called by many other Names I &s;hall &s;hew, with the Rea&s;on of this Variety&mdash;. But whereas &s;ome mi&s;like the calling of that <HI>Faith,</HI> by which we are in Scripture &s;aid to be ju|&s;tified, by the Name of a <HI>Condition</HI>; this may be here a little con&s;i|dered. Some object again&s;t this Word on the Account of the Ambi|guity of it, there being <HI>Conditions</HI> of different Sorts or Kinds, &s;ome of which will not, as they think, agree to the Nature and U&s;e of that Faith by which we are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified. But this perhaps may as
<PB N="35" REF="005439_0050_101831316858b858">
well be objected again&s;t the Word <HI>In&s;trument,</HI> u&s;ed by &s;ome in&s;tead of it. And &s;ome think that this Word a&s;cribes more to Faith, in the Affair of our Ju&s;tification, than does indeed belong to it; or at lea&s;t, that it does not well expre&s;s the true U&s;e and Influence of Faith, in the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner before God. Some therefore expre&s;s the Influence of Faith in this Affair by the Word <HI>In&s;trument,</HI> and &s;ome|times call it an <HI>in&s;trumental Cau&s;e.</HI> But the u&s;e of this Word or Expre&s;&s;ion is al&s;o tho't by <HI>&s;everal,</HI> to have its Inconveniences; with whom I al&s;o concur.</P>
<P>A learned and judicious Divine ob&s;erving the&s;e Difficulties, as he conceives them to be, has thus expre&s;s'd him&s;elf in this Matter.
<Q>I humbly conceive, &s;aith he, we have been ready to look too far to find out what that Influence of Faith in our Ju&s;tification is, or what is that Dependance of this Effect on Faith, &s;ignified by this Expre&s;&s;ion of being <HI>ju&s;tified by Faith,</HI> over-looking that which is mo&s;t obviou&s;ly pointed forth in the Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Ca&s;e being as it is, (there being a Mediator that has purcha&s;ed Ju&s;tifi|cation) Faith in this Mediator is that which renders it a <HI>meet</HI> and <HI>&s;uitable Thing</HI> in the Sight of God, that he rather than others &s;hould have this purcha&s;ed Benefit a&s;&s;igned to him,</Q>
<HI>viz.</HI> he that believeth in the Mediator. Now I willingly agree with this worthy Author, that <HI>that</HI> Faith by which the Ungodly are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified, is the mo&s;t <HI>meet</HI> and <HI>&s;uitable Thing</HI> that could have been required of them to that End; and this was doubtle&s;s the Rea&s;on why God made choice of it to the Place and Office to which he a&s;&s;igned it, rather than any other Thing what&s;oever; yet I think, with Submi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e of better Judgment, That this is no Ways incon&s;i&s;tent with its being called <HI>the Condition</HI> of Men's Ju&s;tification: And it &s;eems to me very evident, that its being &s;o meet and &s;uitable a Qualification, as is expre&s;s'd, is not that by which a firm and &s;ure Connexion is e&s;tabli&s;hed betwixt a Sinner's believing and his being ju&s;tified. The Rea&s;on why all that believe are infallibly ju&s;tified and &s;aved, is not becau&s;e the Sinner that believeth in Chri&s;t is &s;o meetly and &s;uitably qualified to receive the Benefit of Ju&s;tification; but this rather, that by the Promi&s;e of God there is infallible A&s;&s;urance given, that who&s;o|ever believeth &s;hall be ju&s;tified and &s;aved, as in <HI>John</HI> 3.15, 16. <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. <HI>Acts</HI> 10.43. Were it not for this, Sinners could not be &s;ure that they &s;hould be &s;aved on Suppo&s;ition of their believing, were it po&s;&s;ible, that they &s;hould believe, having no &s;uch Promi&s;e. So that af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> all, it is the <HI>Conditionality</HI> of Faith in the Covenant of Grace, that gives it the Advantage of being any Ways in&s;trumental in our

Ju&s;tification <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Willard</HI> of <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> on <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.9.</NOTE>. Thus <HI>it is by Faith, that thro' Grace the Promi&s;e may be &s;ure to all the Seed,</HI> as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.16. <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.17, 18.</P>
<P>What that Faith is, unto which a Promi&s;e of Ju&s;tification is an|nexed, is a Matter of great Importance, and ought diligently to be enquired into; and I purpo&s;e, with God's Help, to con&s;ider this important Point, before I fini&s;h this E&s;&s;ay: But this is not what, in this Place, I de&s;ign. At pre&s;ent I only &s;ay, it is the &s;ame that is re|quired in the Texts of Scripture la&s;t quoted, and in other Places, &s;hewing what Men mu&s;t do to be &s;aved, as in <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37, 38. and 16.30, 31. What is here incumbent on me, is, to &s;tate and clear up the true Notion of an <HI>Offer</HI> of Salvation made to Sinners in the Go&s;pel; and unto this End &s;omething further remains to be &s;aid.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then, the Condition upon which Salvation is offered to <HI>Sinners</HI> is &s;omething required <HI>of them,</HI> that &s;o they may be &s;aved; &s;omething to be done by them unto whom the Offer of Salvation is &s;uppo&s;ed to be made. The Condition required is not meerly this, that if &s;uch or &s;uch a Thing come to pa&s;s, then God will &s;ave us; but if we comply with his Will in doing what is required of us, then God will be&s;tow his Salvation on us. It is, I &s;ay, &s;omething to be done by us, not by God him&s;elf, or any one el&s;e be&s;ides our &s;elves; and this too &s;omething wherein we yield Obedience to the Call of God in the Go&s;pel; &s;omething contained in a proper An&s;wer to this impor|tant Enquiry, "What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved". The Difference betwixt the Covenant of Works, and that of Grace, lies not in this, that the Covenant of Works required our doing &s;omething that &s;o we might live, but the Covenant of Grace nothing at all. What the Covenant of Grace requireth to this End, is &s;ometimes called the <HI>Obedience of Chri&s;t,</HI> Rom. 16.26. and <HI>obeying the Go&s;pel.</HI> It is &s;ome|thing wherein we perform our Duty to God as well as &s;ecure the Sal|vation of our own Souls.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Condition, to this End required, is not only &s;uch, that we &s;hall not be &s;aved if we perform it not; but that we &s;hall be &s;aved if we perform the Thing required. We are not only threatned with Death and Damnation, in Ca&s;e we do it not; but have a Promi&s;e of Life and Salvation, if we perform it. There are &s;ome Things which if tho&s;e that enjoy the Go&s;pel will not do, they &s;hall be damned; as to in&s;tance in two or three. If they will not hear or read the Word
<PB N="37" REF="005439_0052_10183134e2d1c1e0">
of God, meditate on it, endeavour to under&s;tand it, nor at all Regard what is required of them in it; &s;uch, I &s;ay, as will not do the&s;e Things &s;hall certainly be damned; but Per&s;ons may do &s;uch Things as the&s;e, and yet never be &s;aved. God has not promi&s;ed, that all that, after any Manner, do &s;uch Things, &s;hall obtain eternal Life. But the Con|dition on which Salvation is offered, is &s;uch as who&s;oever complies with it &s;hall certainly be &s;aved.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Condition on which Salvation is offered in the Go&s;pel, mu&s;t needs be &s;uch as may be, and is, performed by all that obtain eternal Life, <HI>before</HI> they do obtain it. Men cannot, in the Way of a Covenant, obtain a good Thing conditionally promi&s;ed to them in it, 'till they have performed the Condition on which that Thing is pro|mi&s;ed. But when I &s;ay here, <HI>before,</HI> this mu&s;t not be under&s;tood, as before, in Time, but in Re&s;pect of the Order of Nature, or accor|ding to the Rea&s;on or Dependance of Things one on another: For otherwi&s;e, as &s;oon as the Condition required is by any Sinner per|formed, God without any Delay begins to &s;ave him; yea, puts him into a State of Salvation, &s;ee <HI>John</HI> 5.24. But God will not &s;o much as begin to be&s;tow eternal Life on any Man, 'till he has performed the Condition on which the &s;ame is offered to him.</P>
<P N="4">4. We ought here carefully to di&s;tingui&s;h between an antecedent Condition, and &s;uch as is only concomitant. By an <HI>antecedent</HI> Con|dition, I under&s;tand &s;uch an one as is de&s;cribed in the la&s;t Head, <HI>i. e.</HI> one required in order to our having a good Thing conditionally pro|mi&s;ed: But by a <HI>concomitant</HI> Condition, I intend &s;uch a one as does in&s;eparably accompany a good Thing conditionally promi&s;ed, but is not, in order of Nature, before it. Thus, true Holine&s;s in&s;eparably accompanies the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner; becau&s;e God regenerates every one whom he ju&s;tifies, and that in the very Moment in which he ju&s;tifies him. But true Holine&s;s is not an antecedent Condition of Man's Ju&s;tification, not being required in order to it, tho' it be in&s;eparably joined with it, and is a Qualification belonging to every ju&s;tified Per&s;on. Hence, tho' God promi&s;es Salvation to all holy Per|&s;ons, yet Holine&s;s is not the Condition on which Salvation is promi|&s;ed; nor is any Act &s;o, which floweth from a Principle of true Holi|ne&s;s, and &s;o belongeth to our Sanctification; as I &s;hall hereafter &s;hew.</P>
<P N="5">5. We ought carefully to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the Acts materially con&s;idered, in which the Condition of the new Covenant does con&s;i&s;t, and the Rectitude of the &s;ame Acts, and the Manner in which they
<PB N="38" REF="005439_0053_101830e3ece05b88">
mu&s;t be performed. In this Chapter I only con&s;ider what Acts are required: What is required in Order to their Rectitude will be con|&s;ider'd in the &s;econd Part of this E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P N="6">6. Again, we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt what is required in the Condition under Con&s;ideration, with Relation to the general and &s;pe|cial Nature of it, <HI>i. e.</HI> in what Acts it con&s;i&s;ts, and how the&s;e mu&s;t be performed; and what is required with Re&s;pect to the Prolonga|tion or Continuance of what is required: For a Man may begin, and for a Time do what, as a Condition, is required of him, in order to his having a Benefit which is conditionally promi&s;ed to him; and yet by his Failure &s;all &s;hort of the Good, which, in this Way, he is a Candidate for. Thus our fir&s;t Parents either did or might have, for a Time, continued their Obedience to the Law of Works; and yet, for want of Continuance therein, they &s;ell &s;hort of Life and Happine&s;s, and &s;o ruined them&s;elves and all their Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>And thus I will al&s;o &s;hew, that the Ca&s;e may be, with Re&s;pect to Per&s;ons that are in a State of Probation, in order to their obtain|ing the &s;aving Benefits of the new Covenant: And yet, I am far from holding a Po&s;&s;ibility of falling from Grace, in the Sen&s;e in which <HI>Arminians</HI> and others plead for it, <HI>viz.</HI> that regenerate and ju&s;tified Per&s;ons may fall away, and finally peri&s;h. Yet it is true, that Per|&s;ons may be engaged in &s;uch a Cour&s;e that they &s;hould certainly be &s;aved, did not their Apo&s;tacy prevent it, as I &s;hall hereafter make evi|dent from <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.24. <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.13. and other Places.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is nece&s;&s;ary that I here further ob&s;erve, that the Condition of the Covenant required, in order to the Salvation of &s;inful Men, differs greatly from that which was required in the Covenant of Works, in order to Men's obtaining Life.</P>
<P>If I mention three remarkable Differences betwixt the&s;e it will be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P N="1">1. They differ in Re&s;pect of the Nature of the Thing required: For in the Covenant of Works, the Condition required was perfect Obedience, without any Failure, as to the Matter or Manner of its Performance, as appears <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10. But in the Covenant of Grace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Condition required is Faith, Repentance, a &s;eeking to God for Mercy, a coming to Chri&s;t for Life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as will hereafter be more fully declared.</P>
<P N="2">2. The&s;e Conditions differ greatly in Re&s;pect of the immediate End of their being required: For, according to the End of that re|quired
<PB N="39" REF="005439_0054_10183137167924b0">
in the Covenant of Works, it was to be the very Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, in the Performance of which, Men were to &s;tand righteous be|fore God, and obtain a Title to eternal Life: But that required in the <HI>new Covenant</HI> is not, according to the Tenor of IT, to be our ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or that by which we &s;hould have a Right unto eternal Life, but is required of Sinners in order to their having an Intere&s;t in the perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Another, for their Ju&s;tifi|cation in God's Sight; even the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which is <HI>unto and upon all them that believe,</HI> Rom. 3.22. Such therefore as believe are in Scripture &s;aid to <HI>believe unto Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> i&punc; e. unto the obtaining of it; their Faith not being the Righteou&s;ne&s;s it &s;elf, that in which their ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s does con&s;i&s;t. Read and compare <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.10. with <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.5, and ver. 22. The Particle tran&s;lated <HI>in,</HI> in the two Texts la&s;t referred to, being the &s;ame which is tran&s;la|ted <HI>to,</HI> in <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.10. Faith therefore, which is unto Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, is only &s;o far accepted of God, as that by it we obtain an Intere&s;t in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. And from the Differences already mentioned, it followeth <HI>thirdly,</HI> That the Condition required in the Covenant of Grace is, in a Sen&s;e, a <HI>gracious Condition,</HI> in which that required in the Covenant of Works was not. <HI>That</HI> required in the Covenant of Grace is &s;uch as may be performed <HI>by Sinners. That</HI> of the Covenant of Works was not &s;o; but compatible only to the State of Mankind, <HI>while in Inno|cency. That</HI> of the Covenant of Grace is required that &s;o we may <HI>become</HI> righteous; but <HI>that</HI> of the Covenant of Works was required that &s;o Men might <HI>remain</HI> righteous, as they then actually were. In a Word, <HI>that</HI> now required is the Condition of a mo&s;t gracious and merciful Covenant. <HI>That</HI> of the Covenant of Works was &s;uch as that Men, in the Performance of it, might obtain Life by their own perfect Obedience.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the <HI>Condition</HI> of the Covenant of Grace is of another Kind than <HI>that</HI> of the Covenant of Works. But it does not by any Means appear, that what is in the Covenant of Grace re|quired of Men, in order to their Salvation, is no Condition at all; nor ought that to be granted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Shewing, That there is an Offer or conditional Promi&s;e of Salvation made to Sinners in the Go&s;pel.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING hitherto endeavoured to explain the Pro|po&s;ition under Con&s;ideration; I come now, in the fourth and la&s;t Place, to &s;ay &s;omething for the Con|firmation of the Truth a&s;&s;erted, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is in|deed a Truth, that God does offer Salvation to &s;inful Men in the Go&s;pel; or that he does condi|tionally promi&s;e to be&s;tow eternal Life on them.</P>
<P>But before I enter on the Proof of this mo&s;t comfortable A&s;&s;ertion, it is very nece&s;&s;ary that one Thing, very evidently &s;uppo&s;ed and im|plied in it, be a little explained and cleared up, without the doing of which the main A&s;&s;ertion here maintained cannot be very advantage|ou&s;ly and clearly &s;upported.</P>
<P>Now that which I here intend is this, That Mankind have, &s;ince their Fall into a State of Sin and Death, had &s;o much done for them, in order to their Recovery out of that mi&s;erable E&s;tate, as thereby to be put into a State of Salvability: For otherwi&s;e there would be no Room for an Offer of Salvation to be made to them. Now Man|kind, &s;ince their Apo&s;tacy, may be conceived to be in a &s;alvable Condition in two Re&s;pects, or on a two-fold Account. (1) In Re|&s;pect of the Sufficiency of God to find out and provide a Way for their Salvation, whatever &s;eeming Difficulties, in Re&s;pect of the Threatning denounced again&s;t Sinners, and of his own Truth and Ju&s;tice, &s;eemed to lie again&s;t it; yet this notwith&s;tanding, I &s;ay, the Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s, and Power of God was &s;uch, that it was, in that Re&s;pect, po&s;&s;ible for him to find out and provide a Way, in which &s;uch Sinners as Mankind were, might be eternally &s;aved. But this is not what I principally here intend. Wherefore, (2) Mankind may be &s;aid to be in a &s;alvable State, in Re&s;pect of a Price already paid, or undertaken to be paid, for their Redemption. I &s;ay, either paid or undertaken to be paid, becau&s;e this was the &s;ame Thing in Re&s;pect
<PB N="41" REF="005439_0056_1018313933079d28">
of the Efficacy of the Atonement I intend. It was as available, in Re&s;pect of all the &s;aving Ends of it, before it was actually paid, as it was afterwards; and on this Account our Saviour is call'd <HI>the Lamb &s;lain from the Foundation of the World.</HI> It is in Re&s;pect of this Price of Redemption, that I here affirm Mankind to be in a &s;alvable E&s;tate. They are &s;o now, in Re&s;pect of a Price already paid for them, in order to their eternal Happine&s;s. And this I &s;uppo&s;e to be a Truth, with Re&s;pect to all Mankind without Exception: So that tho' there are many who never will be &s;aved, yet the Rea&s;on of this is not, becau&s;e there is not a &s;ufficient Price paid for their Redemption, nor becau&s;e this is not a Remedy applicable to them, according to the Tenor of the new Covenant, but for other Rea&s;ons hereafter to be mentioned.</P>
<P>This State of Salvability, which Mankind are by me &s;uppo&s;ed to be in, has its Ri&s;e and Foundation, as I have &s;aid, in the Price of Redemption paid for them, by their great Saviour; and that this was of &s;ufficient Value to &s;ave the whole World I here take for granted. That it was a Price laid down for all, without Exception; and, according to the Tenor of the new Covenant, applicable to any one, and to every one of the &s;inful Children of Men, I &s;uppo&s;e to be a Truth clearly revealed in the Word of God; and that the Rea&s;on why it is not &s;o generally believed &s;o to be, is not becau&s;e it is not &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;erted in Scripture, but becau&s;e many have, without &s;ufficient Grounds, &s;uppo&s;ed that a Belief of this cannot be reconciled to &s;ome other Articles of Faith, which they think clearly and &s;ully revealed: But this I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion hereafter to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent I will &s;hew, what is in Scripture affirmed, with Re&s;pect to the Extent of Chri&s;t's Death, with Relation to the End and Ob|ject of it. And here, not to in&s;i&s;t on what is &s;aid about his mediate|rial Righteou&s;ne&s;s, in <HI>Rom.</HI> Chap. 5. betwixt the 12th and the 19th Ver&s;es, where his Righteou&s;ne&s;s is oppo&s;ed to the Sin of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> as a &s;ufficient Remedy again&s;t the Mi&s;chiefs and Mi&s;eries brought on Mankind by it; I &s;hall only recite &s;ome of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, wherein the Univer&s;ality of Chri&s;t's Death, as it re&s;pects the Per&s;ons for whom he died, &s;eems to be plainly and fully a&s;&s;erted. Thus we are told, that <HI>God &s;o loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Life,</HI> John 3.16.

a Ran&s;om for all,</HI> 1 Tim. 2.6. That <HI>he died for all,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. And that <HI>he is the Saviour of all Men, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that believe,</HI> 1 Tim. 4.10.</P>
<P>That the mo&s;t obvious Sen&s;e of the&s;e Texts of Scripture, is, That Je&s;us Chri&s;t died for all Men without Exception, I think very evi|dent. Nor is it at our Liberty to recede from this, without &s;ome urgent Nece&s;&s;ity compelling us to it, which I &s;uppo&s;e can never be &s;hown; but in&s;tead thereof, I will &s;hew a Nece&s;&s;ity of taking of them in the full Latitude in which they are expre&s;s'd. I do not therefore wonder, that there have been a great many eminent Divines, in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, who have been far from being <HI>Arminians,</HI> that have plainly and fully a&s;&s;erted Chri&s;t's dying for all, as I could ea&s;ily ma|nife&s;t, did I rely on humane Authorities, as I do not.</P>
<P>Yet I &s;hall mention one In&s;tance of this, not &s;o much on the Ac|count of the Authority of the Man (tho' I know of no Man who&s;e Authority would go farther in this Ca&s;e) as becau&s;e I think he fairly &s;tates wherein the Difference lies betwixt him&s;elf and &s;ome others, and particularly betwixt what he held and I now hold, and con&s;e|quently wherein the Cri&s;is of this Controver&s;y does, in my Appre|hen&s;ion, lie.</P>
<P>The Per&s;on I intend is the learned Dr. <HI>Twi&s;&s;e</HI>: And the Book from which I &s;hall take &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages, is entitled, <HI>The Riches of God's Love to the Ve&s;&s;els of Mercy,</HI> &amp;c. Part 1. Page 5.
<Q>We are often demanded, <HI>&s;aith he,</HI> whether every one that heareth the Go&s;pel be not bound to believe that Chri&s;t died for him? Now I &s;ay this Phra&s;e, <HI>Chri&s;t died for me,</HI> includes many Things, as the Benefits which ari&s;e unto me by the Death of Chri&s;t, may be conceived to be many. But let the&s;e Benefits be di&s;tingui&s;hed, and we &s;hall readily an&s;wer to the Que&s;tion made, and that perhaps differently, as namely, affirmatively to &s;ome, negatively to others; as thus, Do you &s;peak of Chri&s;t's dying for me, that is, for the Pardon of my Sins, and for the Salvation of my Soul, I an&s;wer affirmatively and &s;ay, I am bound to believe that Chri&s;t died for the procuring of the&s;e Benefits unto me, in &s;uch Manner as God hath ordained; to wit, not ab&s;olutely but conditionally, to wit, in Ca&s;e I do be|lieve and repent. For God hath not otherwi&s;e ordained, that I &s;hould reap the Benefits of Pardon and Salvation, by virtue of Chri&s;t's Death and Pa&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s I believe in him and repent.</Q></P>

<Q>To die for us, or for all, is to die for our Benefit, or for the Benefit of all: Now the&s;e Benefits are of a different Nature, whereof &s;ome are be&s;towed upon Man only conditionally (tho' for Chri&s;t's Sake) and they are the Pardon of Sin and the Salvation of the Soul, and the&s;e God doth confer only upon the Condition of Faith and Re|pentance. Now I am ready to profe&s;s and that, I &s;uppo&s;e, as our of the Mouth of all our Divines, That every one who hears the Go&s;pel, (without Di&s;tinction between Elect and Reprobate) is bound to believe that Chri&s;t died for him, &s;o far as to procure both the Pardon of his Sins and the Salvation of his Soul, in Ca&s;e he believes and repents.</Q>
In another Place he &s;aith, That as
<Q><HI>Peter</HI> could not have been &s;aved, unle&s;s he had believed and re|pented; &s;o <HI>Judas</HI> might have been &s;aved, if he had done &s;o.</Q>
And the Doctor referring to that Text, <HI>John</HI> 3.16. &s;aith on it, That
<Q>it gives a fair Light of Expo&s;ition to tho&s;e Places where Chri&s;t is &s;aid to have died for the Sins of the World, yea, of the whole World, to wit, in this Manner, That who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Life.</Q></P>
<P>Thus far I have Dr. <HI>Twi&s;&s;e</HI> fully with me in what I a&s;&s;ert, <HI>viz.</HI> That Chri&s;t died for all Men, &s;o far forth as to purcha&s;e Life and Salvation for them, in Ca&s;e they believe in him, and repent of their Sins. He did this for the whole World, and not for the Elect only: So there is no Man but what may be &s;aved on the Terms of the new Covenant, even <HI>Judas</HI> was not excepted or excluded.</P>
<P>But here I mu&s;t add a Word, le&s;t this &s;hould be mi&s;under&s;tood. The Meaning of this A&s;&s;ertion is not, that it is a Truth, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t died for all Men, if it &s;hall eventually come to pa&s;s that all Men believe in him, but that otherwi&s;e this A&s;&s;ertion is fal&s;e. It is even now a Truth, that Chri&s;t died for all Men, or otherwi&s;e that he did not die for all Men. This cannot be made either true or fal&s;e, by Men's future Carriages. The Meaning therefore of the A&s;&s;ertion maintained, is, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t has really &s;o died for all Men, as to purcha&s;e this Advantage for them, that they &s;hall be &s;aved, if they will believe and repent.</P>
<P>It is not &s;uppo&s;ed in what is here maintained, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t died equally, or in the &s;ame Sen&s;e, for all Mankind, Elect and Non-Elect. The Difference here is wide, and may, I think, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e be&s;t conceived of, by a due Con&s;ideration of the Relation of Chri&s;t's Death to the two Covenants, to which it has a Reference: I mean that of Redemption

betwixt the glorious Per&s;ons of the holy Trinity, and that of Grace (as it is commonly called) which God has been plea&s;ed to propo&s;e to Mankind &s;ince the Fall.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the Death of Chri&s;t, with Relation to the Covenant of Redemption, or Terms agreed on betwixt the Son of God on the one Part, (as I conceive) and the Father and the holy Spirit, on the other, tho' the Father be more expre&s;ly mentioned in Scripture, as concerned in this Covenant, than the holy Spirit: If, I &s;ay, we con&s;i|der the Death of Chri&s;t, with Relation to this Covenant, the Son of God did, by his Death and mediatorial Righteou&s;ne&s;s, obtain for the Elect of God, or all tho&s;e whom in Scripture the Father is &s;aid to have given him, a perfect and compleat Salvation in all the Parts and Branches of it, the principal of which are enumerated in <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.29. viz. <HI>Effectual Calling, Ju&s;tification</HI> and <HI>Glorification</HI>: For in the Co|venant here intended, Sinners them&s;elves are not a Party; and there|fore the Conditions to be performed lie not on them, but on the Me|diator, who undertook for them, and fulfilled the Terms required of him, in order to the Salvation of tho&s;e who were ordained to Life. None of the&s;e, therefore, ever mi&s;carry, as might be plainly &s;hewed from Scripture, were it my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s. Such as plea&s;e may read and compare <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 53.10, 11, 12. <HI>John</HI> 6.38, 39, 40. <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.29. <HI>Acts</HI> 23.48. <HI>John</HI> 7.37. and Chap. 10.27, 28, 29. Hence the Acts of Chri&s;t's Mediation are &s;poken of, as having a peculiar Reference to the&s;e, in many Places of Scripture, as in <HI>John</HI> 17. ver. 6, 8, and 19, 20. and Chap. 10.15. But &s;uch Places are not to be under&s;tood as if Chri&s;t died for the Elect only: for be&s;ides his ab|&s;olutely mentioning the Salvation of all the&s;e, he was, according to the Covenant of Redemption which he entred into, to bring the Re&s;t into a State of Salvability, that &s;o God might be ju&s;t in ju&s;tifying any of them on the Terms of another Covenant, (that of Grace I intend) which was to be propo&s;ed to Sinners them&s;elves, as plainly appears, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.25, 26. with which that well agreeth, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.22. And upon Chri&s;t's doing this are grounded all the Offers of &s;pecial Mercy made to Sinners in the Covenant of Grace, &s;uch as are implied in <HI>John</HI> 3.16. <HI>Acts</HI> 10.43. <HI>Mark</HI> 16.15, 16. and <HI>Acts</HI> 16.30, 31. And tho' Chri&s;t has by his Obedience and Death, purcha&s;ed the Whole of the Salvation of all the Elect, &s;o that the &s;ame is ju&s;tly due to him; yet they cannot come to the Enjoyment of this Salva|tion, 'till they come up to the Terms of the Go&s;pel, wherein it is conditionally offered to them. How God deals with tho&s;e unto whom Go&s;pel Terms are not offered, I am not here con&s;idering: But this I will venture to &s;ay, that I conceive them to be in a &s;alvable
<PB N="45" REF="005439_0060_1018314112921ac8">
State, &s;o that if they are not &s;aved, it is not becau&s;e Ju&s;tice will not allow of it. And I doubt not but that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was to bring the whole World into &s;uch a State as this, and not the Elect only.</P>
<P>And now let us con&s;ider the Death of Chri&s;t, as it has a Relation to the Covenant of Grace, propo&s;ed to Sinners them&s;elves. Now as Chri&s;t's Death relates to this Covenant, no Man can plead a Right to the Benefits procured by it, 'till he believes in him that died for him; nor can he be put in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;pecial Benefits offered in this Covenant, except he performs the Conditions of it. In this Re&s;pect <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Judas,</HI> Elect and Non-Elect, are on a Level. He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved; he that believeth not &s;hall be damned. As the mediatorial Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is &s;ufficient for the Salva|tion of the whole World, &s;o it is, according to the Tenor of the new Covenant, a Remedy applicable to any Per&s;on, on the Terms therein propo&s;ed; &s;o that it is not contrary to the Ju&s;tice of God, effectually to call, ju&s;tify, and glorify any Per&s;on what&s;oever. If this is not done for all, it is not becau&s;e there is not a &s;ufficient Remedy provided, but for &s;uch other Rea&s;ons as are given in God's Word.</P>
<P>But now let us con&s;ider the Doctor's Antithe&s;is, in the Place above quoted, Page 5.
<Q>If, &s;aith he, the Que&s;tion be made, Whether I am bound to believe that Chri&s;t died for me, to procure Faith and Repentance for me, I do not &s;ay, that I am bound, or that every Man is bound to believe this.</Q>
And a little below he &s;aith,
<Q>I &s;ee a Rea&s;on manife&s;ting that Chri&s;t merited not this for all, no not for all, and every one that hears the Go&s;pel. For if he had, then he had merited it for them ab&s;olutely, or conditionally, not ab&s;olutely, for then all, and every one &s;hould believe <HI>de facto,</HI> which is untrue; for the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, (2 The&s;. 3.) <HI>Fides non e&s;t omnium</HI>; nor conditionally, for what Condition, I pray, can be devi&s;ed, upon the Performance whereof, God, for Chri&s;t's Sake, &s;hould give us Faith and Repentance.</Q>
To this Demand I &s;hall hereafter an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Thus, according to Dr. <HI>Twi&s;&s;e,</HI> tho' the Pardon of Men's Sins and the Salvation of their Souls were conditionally purcha&s;ed for them by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> on the Condition of Faith and Repentance, and this for all, without Exception; yet the&s;e Conditions were, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, purcha&s;ed only for the Elect, and are not offered unto Sinners, on any Condition what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The latter Part of what he held I &s;hall hereafter con&s;ider. That Chri&s;t died to obtain Salvation for all Men, on the Terms of the new Covenant, I now take for granted, at lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it to be a Truth:
<PB N="46" REF="005439_0061_101830efdfcf5b38">
And all tho&s;e for whom Chri&s;t thus died, I hold to be in a &s;alvable E&s;tate; otherwi&s;e, how are they beholden to Chri&s;t for thus dying for them?</P>
<P>And I would fain be plainly &s;hewed how the Go&s;pel can be preached to any Sinner for whom Chri&s;t thus died not? Or on what Foundation any Sinner can have Salvation offered to him, for whom it hath never been &s;o much as conditionally obtained by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the Sen&s;e allowed by Dr. <HI>Twi&s;&s;e,</HI> as above? May a Sinner be &s;aved without having any Price of Redemption paid for him, in Ca&s;e he believes? Or does this &s;till remain to be done for him, if he &s;hould believe in Chri&s;t? Or may Salvation be fitly offered to him for whom Chri&s;t died not, on Condition of his believing, tho' it could not be given to him &s;hould he believe? Seeing God knows that it is not in his Power to believe, having no Object &s;et before him, on which his Faith may be fixed, or any Eye to look to him, if there were, as is required in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 45.22. I may very &s;eriou&s;ly &s;ay, I know of no Kindne&s;s that can be &s;hown in &s;uch an Offer, <HI>i. e.</HI> an Offer of Sal|vation made to Sinners that are not in a &s;alvable State.</P>
<P>But Chri&s;t having died for all Men, to purcha&s;e Salvation for them, on the Terms expre&s;&s;ed in a mo&s;t gracious Covenant, <HI>well ordered in all Things and &s;ure,</HI> there is then a Foundation laid for a Treaty of Peace and Reconciliation with &s;inful Men, on the Account of a Price of Redemption paid by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.24, 25, 26. where the Apo&s;tle having affirmed, that <HI>all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the Glory of God,</HI> he adds, that <HI>we are ju&s;tified freely by his Grace, thro' the Redemption that is in Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Whom God hath &s;et forth to be a Propitiation thro' Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteou&s;ne&s;s for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins that are pa&s;t, thro' the Forbearance of God; to declare, I &s;ay, at this Time, his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that God might be ju&s;t and the Ju&s;tifier of him that believeth in Je&s;us.</HI> In which Words we are a&s;&s;ured, That it would not have &s;tood with the Ju&s;tice of God to have ju&s;tified a Sinner, tho' a Believer, had not Chri&s;t been &s;et forth, as in the Words expre&s;&s;ed. And it will no more con&s;i&s;t with the Ju&s;tice of God to offer Salvation to a Sinner for whom Chri&s;t died not, than actually to &s;ave him without Chri&s;t's dying for him. And Salvation might have been as well offered to the whole World, if Chri&s;t had not died at all, as to any one Sinner for whom he died not.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="005439_0062_10183143cdd62ce0">How there has been a Foundation laid for the Salvation of &s;inful Men, or Way made for it, &s;o that it may be done without any In|jury to the Ju&s;tice of God, or any other of his Attributes, yea, with great Honour to them all, has been now &s;ufficiently declared. And the Rea&s;on why the Go&s;pel is not preached, and Salvation offered to all Mankind, is not becau&s;e all are not in a &s;alvable State, or becau&s;e there is not a Foundation laid in the Mediation of Chri&s;t for the Sal|vation of any Per&s;on or People in the World: So that there is no Sin|ner that has not committed the unpardonable Sin, who may not be invited to believe in the Son of God, and promi&s;ed, that &s;o doing, he &s;hall be &s;aved.</P>
<P>But before I prove, that Salvation is offered to Sinners in the Go&s;|pel, there are three Things nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved to clear up my Way to what is de&s;igned, and they are the&s;e here following.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Promi&s;es of Salvation made in the Word of God, to &s;uch as are already in a regenerate and ju&s;tified State, are nor conditional, but ab&s;olute. God does not in his Word &s;ay to any regenerate and ju&s;tified Per&s;on, that if he &s;hall or will believe and repent, he &s;hall be ju&s;tified and &s;aved. There is no Rea&s;on or Occa&s;ion for God &s;o to &s;ay to tho&s;e who have already believed and are pa&s;&s;ed from Dead to Life, and &s;o are &s;ecured from ever coming into Condem|nation, as in <HI>John</HI> 5.24. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1. But they are poor unregene|rate, unju&s;tified Sinners that have, in the Go&s;pel, a conditional Offer of Salvation made to them. The&s;e are there told, that tho' they are at pre&s;ent in a State of Sin and Death, yet if they will <HI>believe in the Son of God, they &s;hall have Life through his Name,</HI> as in <HI>John</HI> 20.31. but that otherwi&s;e, they &s;hall die in their Sins, <HI>John</HI> 8.24.</P>
<P>Indeed there is another Sen&s;e, in which it may be, and is, in Scripture, &s;aid to Per&s;ons already in a State of Salvation, it being yet unknown to them&s;elves and others that they are &s;o, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>&s;uppo&s;ing ye are now true Believers, and in a regenerate State, ye &s;hall be certainly &s;aved for ever: As ye be already in a State of Salvation, &s;o God will certainly &s;ave you for the future, perfecting in you all that does concern you.</Q>
<HI>He that has begun a good Work in you will perfect it to the Day of Chri&s;t,</HI> as in <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.6. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.3, 4, 5. Hereto agreeth that of our Saviour, <HI>John</HI> 11.26. (as well as <HI>John</HI> 5.24&punc; before mentioned) <HI>He that liveth and believeth in me &s;hall never die.</HI> The Faith intended in &s;uch Places of Scripture as the&s;e, is not a Condition on which Salvation is offered, which they already have, but the Qualification by which Per&s;ons may be known to be in a ju&s;tified State; and this Kind of Faith is infu&s;ed in our Regene|ration,
<PB N="48" REF="005439_0063_101830f3aa0af080">
as &s;hall be hereafter &s;hown. Of this Kind of Faith that Text is to be under&s;tood, <HI>John</HI> 5.24. The &s;ame Kind of Faith is al&s;o intended, 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.1.</P>
<P N="2">2. I mu&s;t here al&s;o ob&s;erve, That whenever any &s;piritual Benefit or good Thing is conditionally promi&s;ed in Scripture, which is never be&s;towed on any but &s;uch as are eternally &s;aved, under the Name of that good Thing, the whole of Man's Salvation is always compre|hended or compri&s;ed. Salvation is a complex Subject including &s;eve|ral Things in it, all which are firmly connected or knit together, &s;o as never to be &s;eparated in any Per&s;on that is &s;aved. As tho&s;e who are not &s;aved have none of them, &s;o tho&s;e that are &s;aved have them all: Therefore all of them are &s;poken of as <HI>Things accompanying Salvation,</HI> Heb. 6.9. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that if but one or two of the&s;e Things are mentioned, in any Promi&s;e of God, they are all nece&s;&s;arily intended and compri&s;ed under the Name of that Thing, or tho&s;e Things that are expre&s;ly named, as much as if they were all enumerated. There is no Occa&s;ion of particularly naming of them all, becau&s;e they forever all go together, and he that &s;hall have one of them &s;hall as certainly have all the re&s;t. We are not therefore to think, that Salvation is conditionally promi&s;ed in the Texts only wherein it is particularly named: A Promi&s;e of Pardon of Sin, of Ju&s;tification, of the holy Spirit, of &s;piritual Wi&s;dom, re&s;pectively, is as truly a Promi&s;e of Salvation, as that, <HI>Who&s;oever believeth &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> So when <HI>Salvation</HI> is in <HI>that Word</HI> promi&s;ed, all Things which <HI>that Term</HI> comprehends, as above, are therein promi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3">3. I mu&s;t here further ob&s;erve, That on what&s;oever Condition any &s;piritual Benefit compri&s;ed in Man's Salvation, is promi&s;ed, under that Term or Condition, the whole Condition of Man's Salvation, or every Thing required as a Condition of it, is nece&s;&s;arily compri&s;ed or implied. The Rea&s;on of this is very plain. If a Per&s;on be required to do one Thing, unto which &s;everal others are in&s;eparably connected, in Re&s;pect of the Nature of them, and their Relation and Dependance one on another, all tho&s;e Things mu&s;t needs be virtually required under the Name of that one. Hence whenever God, in Scripture, requires either Faith, Repen|tance, Obedience, Prayer, or Fear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he requires every one of the&s;e. A Man cannot do any one of the&s;e Things without doing them all; therefore God, in requiring any one of them, does vir|tually require them all; and if he annex a Promi&s;e to the Performance of this, that, or the other of them, that Promi&s;e has a Relation to them all, and they are all virtually or implicitly compri&s;ed in the
<PB N="49" REF="005439_0064_1018314702148ff0">
Condition of it. Thus if Salvation be conditionally promi&s;ed to Be|lieving, it is therein conditionally promi&s;ed to Repentance al&s;o; be|cau&s;e the&s;e Things are in&s;eparable in the Nature of them, &s;o that one of them cannot be without the other; and the like may be &s;aid con|cerning calling on God, &s;eeking his Face, fearing his Name, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We therefore find in Scripture, that Promi&s;es of &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, or, in a Word, of Salvation, in which all &s;uch Ble&s;&s;ings are compre|hended, are made promi&s;cuou&s;ly to &s;uch Actions or Duties as I have ju&s;t now named; but by no Means to any of them exclu&s;ively of the re&s;t, but to this or that in which all the re&s;t are implied, as being in|&s;eparable from it.</P>
<P>And it is the more nece&s;&s;ary thus to conceive, becau&s;e the Things by God required of Man, are of &s;uch a mixt Nature, and (if I may &s;o &s;peak) &s;o blended together, that they cannot be fully de&s;cribed or conceived of, without taking into the Idea of them, re&s;pectively, &s;ome|thing belonging to the re&s;t. As to in&s;tance, we have a Promi&s;e that he that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. But how can we con|ceive of this Faith or Believing; as wholly excluding Repentance, Obe|dience, and Prayer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the Idea of it? And how can we de|fine Repentance, without compri&s;ing Faith, Obedience and Prayer in it? Is not Faith exerci&s;ed in Repentance and Prayer? And does not Faith give Life and Vigour to it? <HI>We cannot call on him, on whom we do not believe,</HI> Rom. 10.14. Nor is that worthy the Name of Prayer that has no Faith in it, or is not a Prayer of Faith, <HI>Jam.</HI> 5.15. And of Repentance the &s;ame may be &s;aid. All our Duties mu&s;t be mixed with Faith, or they will be unacceptable to God, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.2. and 11.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">6. If we go about nicely to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e Things, we neither edify our &s;elves nor others; nay, we do thereby but perplex the true Servants of God. When we &s;peak of Believers, Penitents, &s;uch as call on the Name of the Lord, the Righteous, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the &s;ame Per&s;ons are, by the&s;e Terms, intended. And it is &s;o al&s;o when the Holy Gho&s;t &s;peaks of &s;uch.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things being ob&s;erved, and duly con&s;idered, I need not &s;ay much to prove, That Salvation is offered or conditionally promi&s;ed unto Sinners in the Go&s;pel. The mo&s;t that now remains needful to this End, is, to quote and recite &s;ome of the many Texts of Scripture, wherein it is obvious that they have in the Go&s;pel &s;uch Offers of Salvation made to them; and in what Things the Condition of the new Covenant does con&s;i&s;t.</P>

<P>I &s;hall, unto the Scripture Te&s;timonies, add two Rea&s;ons to prove, That Salvation is conditionally offered unto Sinners in the Go&s;pel;
<PB N="51" REF="005439_0066_1018314d17f368a0">
and &s;o I &s;hall conclude this Chapter, and this fir&s;t Part of my E&s;&s;ay. Now my Rea&s;ons are the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. If God does not offer, or conditionally promi&s;e Salvation unto Sinners in the Go&s;pel of his Son, then he does not &s;ave them in the Way of a Covenant, which, I think, according to Scripture, he evi|dently does; and al&s;o according to the Judgment of the Generality of orthodox Divines. That Sinners are &s;aved in the Way of a Cove|nant, I think, the Word of God does plainly enough hold forth. This in Scripture is call'd the <HI>new Covenant</HI>; and generally, by <HI>Prote&s;tants, the Covenant of Grace</HI>: Of it we read frequently in the Oracles of God; unto &s;ome of which Places I &s;hall content my &s;elf here to refer my Reader, partly becau&s;e it would take much Time to tran&s;cribe them; and partly becau&s;e I hope there are not many who que&s;tion what I a&s;&s;ert. This was the Covenant made with <HI>Abraham</HI> and his Seed, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.7. And that in which <HI>David</HI> profe&s;&s;eth, is <HI>all his Salvation and all his De&s;ire,</HI> 2 Sam. 23.5. It is a Covenant made with Sin|ners in a wretched State of Sin and Mi&s;ery, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.8. A better Covenant than the old Covenant was; and a Covenant in which &s;pi|ritual Ble&s;&s;ings are given, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.33. <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.10,&mdash;13. and in which everla&s;ting Mercies are conditionally promi&s;ed to the Keepers of it, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 103.17, 18. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 25.10. and <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38, 39. How then can it be denied, That Salvation is conditionally promi&s;ed in the Go&s;pel? I expect, that if I meet with Oppo&s;ition in this Particular, I &s;hall have many that will &s;tand in my Defence; and I am &s;ure I can produce a great Number to vouch for me, among Divines who have been in good Credit in the Church of God; tho' I know <HI>Antinomians</HI> deny what I here maintain.</P>
<P N="2">2. If Salvation be not promi&s;ed conditionally unto Sinners, then they have no Ground of A&s;&s;urance, that on the Performance of the Duties which God requireth of them, in order to their Salvation, they &s;hall certainly be &s;aved. I &s;uppo&s;e it neither can, nor will be denied, that God requires &s;ome Things of &s;inful Men, to be done by them, with an Eye and View to their eternal Salvation: But is it likely to be true, or comfortable to be believed, that God has not promi&s;ed us eternal Life, in Ca&s;e we do what is required of us, in order <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our obtaining it? We are not yet come to con&s;ider, how far it is in the Power of &s;inful Men to perform what is incumbent on them in order to their Salvation. That will be the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;econd Part of my Book. But the Que&s;tion here is, Whether God does not, in
<PB N="52" REF="005439_0067_101830fbc01fc0e8">
Go&s;pel, conditionally offer to &s;ave Sinners? And I &s;ay, if he does not, then Sinners have no A&s;&s;urance given them of it, whatever they do, in order to their obtaining eternal Life: And if &s;o, I confe&s;s they have not &s;o good Encouragement to endeavour to comply with their Duty, as I have ever tho't they had, and, as I think, that Text much favours their having, Rom. 4.16. <HI>Therefore it is of Faith, that it might be by Grace; to the End the Promi&s;e might be &s;ure to all the Seed, not to that only which is of the Law, but to that al&s;o which is of the Faith of</HI> Abraham, <HI>who is the Father of us all.</HI></P>

<P>I come now to the &s;econd Part of my E&s;&s;ay; and that which I principally de&s;igned in it, Namely,</P>
<P><HI>That the Offer of Salvation made to Sinners in the Go&s;pel, compri&s;eth in it an Offer of the Grace given in Regeneration.</HI></P>
<P>Now I &s;hall endeavour the Explanation and Confirmation of this Truth, in &s;everal Chapters hereafter following.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Concerning the Grace of Regeneration, here &s;aid to be conditionally offered unto Sinners.</HEAD>
<P>_SINCE I &s;uppo&s;e the Grace of Regeneration to be compri&s;ed in that Salvation, which is offered to Sinners in the Go&s;pel; it will be nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;hew what I mean by that which I &s;o call: And I &s;uppo&s;e that by a ju&s;t Account o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, it will appear to be a very eminent Part of that great Sal|vation which Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed, and which God be&s;tows on all tho&s;e whom he eternally &s;aves.</P>
<P>Now I &s;hall not here attempt to give a full Account of the great Work of Regeneration, but only to ob&s;erve and a&s;&s;ert &s;ome Things
<PB N="54" REF="005439_0069_101830fdcfcaf418">
concerning it, the Ob&s;ervation of which will, I think, be to my pre|&s;ent Purpo&s;e; and they are &s;uch as here follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. In Regeneration there is a real Change wrought in the Soul of a Sinner. (1) That in Regeneration there is a Change wrought, I &s;uppo&s;e will not be denied. (2) This Change is a <HI>real</HI> Change. I &s;o call it in this Place, not in Oppo&s;ition to the mere Shew and Ap|pearance of one, but to di&s;tingui&s;h it from a Change <HI>relative.</HI> In the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner, he pa&s;&s;eth under a relative Change, <HI>viz.</HI> a Change from a State of Guilt, to a State of Peace and Favour with God: But in Regeneration, a Sinner has a real Change wrought in and upon his Per&s;on&punc; He is made in him&s;elf really better than he was before. (3) The immediate Subject of this Change is the Soul of the Sinner, in whom it is wrought; tho' the &s;ame does al&s;o affect his Body, yet I think the immediate Subject of it is the Soul. In it he has a new Heart given to him, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Change intended re&s;pects the Sinner's moral State and Condi|tion. It is not a Change in the E&s;&s;ence of his Soul, and Faculties of it; but it re&s;pects its moral Qualities. The Soul of the Man is e&s;&s;en|tially the &s;ame in every Condition. He has not really another Soul given to him, when he is regenerated; but his Soul is made, in a moral Sen&s;e, better than it was; being made holy, whereas it was utterly de&s;titute of any true Holine&s;s; (in a &s;trict and proper Sen&s;e &s;o called,) and very full of Sin.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the Change intended, Sinners are delivered from the reigning Power and Dominion of Sin. Tho' they may &s;till have, yea, they really have, a great deal of Sin and Corruption remaining in them, as the Apo&s;tle &s;hews at large in <HI>Rom.</HI> Chap. 7. and more briefly in <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.17. yet they are no longer under the reigning Power and Do|minion of their Corruptions, as the &s;ame Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;erts at large in the 6th Chapter of <HI>Romans,</HI> as any one may &s;ee, that will plea&s;e to read it; e&s;pecially Ver&s;es 2, 6, 7, 14, 18, and 22. which I need not tran&s;cribe.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is in the Change which I &s;peak of, a Principle of &s;piritual Life and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oline&s;s infu&s;ed into, or implanted in, the Soul. As Sin is mortified in it, &s;o it is quickned and made capable of &s;erving God in Newne&s;s of Life. Indeed it is by that Change which is wrought in it that both the&s;e are effected.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="005439_0070_10183150c5c03e88">But here I &s;hall more particularly ob&s;erve, (1) That in this Change the Soul that was dead in Sin, is quickned: And &s;o we are plainly informed in Eph. 2.1. <HI>And you hath he quickned, who were dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins.</HI> And in Col. 2.13. <HI>And you being dead in your Sins, and in the Uncircumci&s;ion of your Fle&s;h, hath he quickned together with him.</HI> (2) Sinners are thus quickned by having a Principle of &s;piritual Life put into them, or implanted in them, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.5, 6. This Principle of &s;piritual Life, or true Holine&s;s, put into the Souls of Men in their Regeneration, is in Scripture called by &s;everal Names, as <HI>a new Heart and a new Spirit,</HI> Ezek. 36.26. <HI>The Spirit which lu&s;t|eth again&s;t the Fle&s;h,</HI> Gal. 5.17. <HI>The new Man,</HI> Eph. 4.24. <HI>The Seed of God,</HI> 1 John 3.9. <HI>The divine Nature,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.4. <HI>Eternal Life,</HI> 1 John 3.15. All that have this divine and heavenly Princi|ple in them, have already eternal Life, and are <HI>pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life,</HI> John 5.24. (3) This Principle is that by which &s;uch as have it, are inclined and di&s;po&s;ed to live unto God, or to live holy and godly Lives. Let it be here ob&s;erved, that Regeneration does not con&s;i&s;t in any one or more good Act or Actions, but in God's quali|fying and di&s;po&s;ing the Soul to perform them. This is evident in Eph. 2.10. <HI>We are his Workman&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works, which God hath before ordained, that we &s;hould walk in them.</HI> See, for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26, 27. compared with <HI>Luke</HI> 6.43, 44, 45. The Tree mu&s;t be good before the Fruit can be &s;o.</P>
<P>The Change under Con&s;ideration is wrought by the Power of the Holy Spirit, the Soul being wholly pa&s;&s;ive in it. Here we may ob|&s;erve &s;everal Things, as (1) That the Holy Spirit is the great Agent, who worketh this Change: Therefore &s;uch as are &s;aid to be born again, are &s;aid to be <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> John 3.5, 6. Our Regene|ration is our Sanctification, and this is the Sanctification of the Spirit, 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 2.13. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.2. This Work is not a&s;cribed to the Spi|rit, to exclude the Father and Son, but becau&s;e it belongs to the Application of Redemption, which, according to the Oeconomy of the divine Per&s;ons, is e&s;pecially a&s;cribed to the Holy Spirit. The Regenerate are frequently &s;aid to be <HI>born of God</HI>; but then he works this Change by his Spirit. (2) The <HI>mighty Power</HI> of the Holy Gho&s;t is put forth in working this Change: By Nothing &s;hort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">eof can this Work be effected. It is, according to the Language of the Scripture, Creation-Work, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.10&punc; <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.10. and Chap. 4.24. And being &s;o, the Power of God is put forth in it, even <HI>the xeceeding Greatne&s;s of his Power to us-ward that believe, according to the Working of his mighty Power; which wrought in Chri&s;t, when he
<PB N="56" REF="005439_0071_101831006f9a2070">
rai&s;ed him from the Dead,</HI> Eph. 1.19, 20. (3) And from hence it followeth, that the Soul pa&s;&s;ing under this great Change, is wholly pa&s;&s;ive therein. The Soul lends no Hand towards the Working this Change in it. Alas! What can that do? If it had as much Power as ever it had, it could do Nothing in &s;uch a difficult Work as this. To God only this is po&s;&s;ible. This therefore is a Work every where a&s;cribed to the mighty God. There is no Intimation in Scrip|ture of the Sinner's doing any Thing towards it him&s;elf; but the contrary is plainly a&s;&s;erted, as in <HI>John</HI> 1.13. where it is &s;aid of &s;uch as were born of the Spirit, that they were <HI>born not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fle&s;h, nor of the Will of Man, but of God.</HI> It followeth (4) That this Change is not wrought by moral Sua&s;ion, but by the immediate Energy of the Holy Gho&s;t. By moral Sua&s;ion, I intend, the Word of God, either read or heard, or any moral Motives or Per&s;ua&s;ions what&s;oever. And when I &s;ay this Change is wrought by the <HI>immediate</HI> Influence of the Holy Gho&s;t; I mean, that he u&s;eth no In&s;trument at all in the Working of it; and that it is a &s;uper-natural Change. When it is &s;aid by &s;ome to be a <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> Change, I &s;uppo&s;e they u&s;e <HI>that Word</HI> to &s;ignify that it is not wrought by moral Sua&s;ion, as I al&s;o affirm. And that indeed it is not, is from hence evident, that the Soul is pa&s;&s;ive in it, as I &s;hewed under the la&s;t Head. For it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible, that the Soul &s;hould be wholly pa&s;&s;ive in any Change wrought in or upon it, by moral Sua&s;ion; becau&s;e the Na|ture of moral Sua&s;ion is to move and excite to Action, in a moral or rational Way, in which a Suppo&s;ition of Pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s is a Contradiction. When Sinners are &s;aid to be <HI>begotten by the Word of Truth,</HI> Jam. 1.18. their <HI>active Conver&s;ion</HI> is intended, not that Change, in which the Soul is <HI>pa&s;&s;ive,</HI> betwixt which Divines are wont to di&s;tingui&s;h; and betwixt the&s;e there is a plain Di&s;tinction made in Scripture, as has been before ob&s;erved. See <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26, 27. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.10. <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.18, 19, before quoted.</P>
<P>It followeth from the Premi&s;es, That Regeneration is an in&s;tan|taneous Change. The Work of Sanctification is indeed a gradual Work, as plainly appears in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.18. but the Work of Rege|neration is not &s;o. This is evident from this Rea&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> that Re|generation is the very Beginning of the Work of Sanctification. When God works the Change called Regeneration, he then begins to &s;anctify that Soul that is the Subject of it. Of his Beginning of which Work we read, Phil. 1.6. <HI>He that has begun a good Work in you, will perform it until the Day of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Now the Beginning of any Work cannot be gradual, but mu&s;t needs be in&s;tantaneous.
<PB N="57" REF="005439_0072_10183155f6a14678">
Therefore every Man in the World is, at pre&s;ent, either in a rege|nerate or in an unregenerate State. There is no &s;uch Condition as wherein a Per&s;on is in neither of the&s;e, but betwixt both. As, in the natural Birth, a Per&s;on is as fully born the fir&s;t Day he comes into the World, as when he comes to be of full Stature; &s;o it is in the &s;piritual Birth al&s;o. Tho&s;e in whom God has wrought a &s;aving Change, are as truly converted and born again, as ever they will be, tho' they may after this grow in Grace, and <HI>grow up to the Mea|&s;ure of the Stature of perfect Men in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, I ob&s;erve here, That the Change wrought in Regeneration is a permanent Change. It is never lo&s;t or fallen from. He that begins this good Work perfects it to the Day of Chri&s;t, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.6. before mentioned. The Seed of God remains in all that have it, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.9. not but that it might be lo&s;t, had not God promi&s;ed that it &s;hall not, <HI>Jer.</HI> 32.40. and el&s;ewhere. The Image of God, with which Man was before his Fall endowed, might be lo&s;t, becau&s;e God had not promi&s;ed that it &s;hould not, yea, becau&s;e God had threat|ned, that if he &s;inned it &s;hould; for &s;o much was intended in that Threatning, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. as I have formerly &s;hewed. But now the Ca&s;e is far otherwi&s;e. God has, in the new Covenant, promi&s;ed never to take his Holy Spirit from his true Saints and Servants, who have experienced the great Work of Regeneration. His Seed &s;hall remain in them. They have eternal Life abiding in them; and they &s;hall never be deprived of it, <HI>John</HI> 11.26.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.
That the Grace of Regeneration which has been de&s;cribed, is &s;uch an eminent Part of Man's Salvation, that Salvation cannot be offered to Sinners, without an Offer of it.</HEAD>
<P>_TO make good what I here maintain, I will (1) &s;hew, that the Grace of Regeneration is a very eminent Part of Man's Salvation. (2) That it being &s;o, Salvation cannot be offered to Sinners without an Offer of it.</P>
<P>The former of the&s;e is &s;o manife&s;t from what has been already &s;aid, that there is &s;carce any Occa&s;ion to add any Thing here, for the Confirmation of it. In the fir&s;t Part of this E&s;&s;ay, Chap. II. Page 30. I have &s;hewed, that Man's Salvation does very eminently con&s;i&s;t in his Deliverance from the Power and Dominion of Sin; and in the fir&s;t Chapter of this &s;econd Part, that this is done in Man's Regeneration, wherein he is &s;et free from the reigning Power and Dominion of his own depraved Nature, which, as he comes into the World, he is a Servant and Slave unto. I have therein al&s;o &s;hewed, that in this great Work, Man is endowed with a Principle of &s;piritual Life, yea, with Life eternal; &s;o that he has everla&s;ting Life as &s;oon as he is born again, as in <HI>John</HI> 5.24. Now wherein can Man's Salvation more eminently con&s;i&s;t, than in his ha|ving &s;uch Things as the&s;e done for him? And add hereunto what I have already made good, <HI>viz.</HI> That all this is wholly done for &s;inful Men by the ble&s;&s;ed God him&s;elf, they doing Nothing in it or to it them&s;elves, but being wholly pa&s;&s;ive therein. This &s;erves further to clear up the Point, that this belongs to the great Salvation, of which God is the Author, and which none can work but he.</P>
<P>And how well does this agree with what we have in Scripture, with Relation to the Salvation of God, wrought by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who came into this lower World <HI>to &s;ave his People from their Sins,</HI> as in <HI>Matth.</HI> 1.21. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.15. And this was not to &s;ave them from the Guilt of Sin only, but from the Defilement and Dominion of Sin
<PB N="59" REF="005439_0074_1018106a3b933498">
al&s;o. He accordingly gave him&s;elf for us, <HI>that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and parify to him&s;elf a peculiar People zealous of good Works,</HI> Tit. 2.14. And this is accompli&s;hed for &s;inful Men when they are, <HI>according to his Mercy, &s;aved by the Wa&s;hing of Regeneration, and the Renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> as in <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.15. By which Words it appears, that their Regeneration is their Salvation: And this was what was by the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> foretold, in Ezek. 36.25. <HI>I will &s;prinkle clean Water upon you, and you &s;hall be clean: From all your Filthine&s;s, and from all your Idols will I clean&s;e you.</HI> And the next Words &s;hew how this was to be done, Ver. 26. <HI>A new Heart al&s;o will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In this, as has formerly been &s;aid, Man's Salvation does more properly con&s;i&s;t, than in his Deliverance from the Guilt of Sin by Chri&s;t's Blood, which yet is no le&s;s a Fruit of his Death, than that. By <HI>that,</HI> Way is made for Man's Happine&s;s: By <HI>this</HI> we are, in Part, actually delivered from the Dominion and Slavery of Sin: By <HI>that</HI> we have a Right given us unto eternal Life: By <HI>this</HI> we are put in actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, &s;o as never to be deprived of it. See <HI>John</HI> 11.26. and Chap. 4.14.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee that Man's Salvation does eminently con&s;i&s;t in his Regeneration.</P>
<P>I now proceed to &s;hew, That &s;ince it is, as has been &s;aid, Salva|tion cannot be offered unto &s;inful Men, without an Offer of regene|rating Grace. A Suppo&s;ition of offering Salvation to Sinners, with|out offering to them that in which Salvation does eminently con&s;i&s;t, carries or implies in it a plain Contradiction. Salvation is in Scripture called eternal Life, <HI>John</HI> 3.15, 16. and frequently el&s;ewhere. Now there is no other eternal Life mentioned in Scripture, as by God given to &s;inful Men, but that &s;piritual Life which is given in Rege|neration. It is the &s;ame, I doubt not, that is intended by our Sa|viour, in John 17.3. <HI>This is Life eternal, that they may know thee, the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI> The Know|ledge of God and Chri&s;t, in this Place intended, is undoubtedly given in Regeneration, and this is &s;aid to be eternal Life, not as being the Condition on which eternal Life is offered, but becau&s;e eternal Life does formally and eminently con&s;i&s;t in it. It is the great Happi|ne&s;s of all that have it: And they are already in a ble&s;&s;ed State that are the Subjects of it. So was <HI>Peter,</HI> Matth. 16.27. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed art thou</HI> Simon Bar-jona: <HI>For Fle&s;h and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.</HI> Such as &s;o know God and Chri&s;t may &s;ay, as in 1 John 5.20. <HI>We know that the Son of God is c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me, and
<PB N="60" REF="005439_0075_1018310991c0bd20">
hath given us an Under&s;tanding, that we &s;hould know him that is true: And we are in him that is true, even in his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> This is the true God and eternal Life. Per&s;ons thus qualified in their Regene|ration, are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame Kind of Life, which all the Saints &s;hall live in Heaven for ever. For Grace here and Glory hereafter differ only <HI>gradually,</HI> nor <HI>&s;pecifically,</HI> not in Kind but in Degrees; and Grace in all its Degrees is called Glory.</P>
<P>The Impo&s;&s;ibility of offering Salvation to &s;inful Men, without offer|ing the Grace of Regeneration to them, may be thus made further evident: God cannot be truly &s;aid to offer Salvation to Sinners with|out offering to them what&s;oever is nece&s;&s;ary on his Part, in order to their Salvation. God may offer Salvation to Sinners without offering to them what is nece&s;&s;ary on their Part, in order to their Salvation, &s;uch as is the Condition required of them in order to it: But an Offer of Salvation, without an Offer of what is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to it, on the Part of him, by whom the Offer is &s;uppo&s;ed to be made, &s;eemeth utterly impo&s;&s;ible. There may be indeed the Shew of &s;uch an Offer, but really there can be none. Such a &s;eeming Offer cannot be &s;incere. If a Phy&s;ician in who&s;e Power alone it is to heal a &s;ick Man, &s;hould tell him he would be&s;tow a plentiful E&s;tate upon him, provided he would do &s;omething, which a Man in Health only can do, and not withal offer to re&s;tore him to Health; would any one &s;ay, that <HI>that</HI> Phy&s;ician was &s;incere and kind, in that &s;eeming Offer? Or would he not rather be guilty of mocking and tantalizing him therein. I do not charge the ble&s;&s;ed God with dealing thus with &s;inful Men, but am &s;hewing that he does not. A better Account may be given of his Dealings with them than this is, as by the Help of God, I hope to make evident in the Sequel of this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Concerning the Nature of that Faith and Repentance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to which the Promi&s;e of eternal Life is, in this Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ed to be made.</HEAD>
<P>_IT has been already &s;aid, That the Condition on which Salvation is promi&s;ed to Sinners in the Go&s;pel, does include or compri&s;e in it Faith, Repentance, Obedience, Seeking of God, and in a Word, every Thing, what|ever it be, that is &s;o required of them, to whom the Go&s;pel is preached, that God will not &s;ave them with|out it. But this is too general an Account of the Nature o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Condition of the new Covenant, or of the Condition required of Sin|ners, in order to their Salvation; which is the Rea&s;on of what is here propo&s;ed to Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>For whereas Faith, Repentance, Obedience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or by whatever other Names the&s;e Acts are called, are of two Sorts or Kinds, accor|ding to the different States Per&s;ons are in, <HI>viz.</HI> either a State of Na|ture, I mean that Condition that all Mankind are in, while unrege|nerate, or not born of the Spirit: Or a regenerate and ju&s;tified E&s;tate, &s;uch as they are in, who are born of God and become new Creatures. Whereas, I &s;ay, &s;uch Acts as in Scripture, go by the Names of Faith, Repentance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do &s;pecifically differ, according to the different State of the Per&s;ons, by whom they are performed; it mu&s;t needs be nece&s;&s;ary to enquire, which of the&s;e two Kinds of Acts they are, which are required of Sinners in order to their Salvation; and to do this is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Chapter.</P>
<P>Now, whereas I maintain in this E&s;&s;ay, That the Grace of Rege|neration is compri&s;ed in the Salvation conditionally offered in the Go&s;|pel, it will evidently follow on this Suppo&s;ition, That the Faith and Repentance required in the Covenant of Grace, as the Condition on which Salvation is offered to us, cannot be of that Kind which is exer|ci&s;ed by none but regenerate and ju&s;tified Per&s;ons; for &s;o, Sinners &s;hould be in a State of Salvation before they perform the Condition
<PB N="62" REF="005439_0077_1018310b616a8120">
required of them, in order to their being &s;aved; contrary to Rea&s;on and to Scripture al&s;o; for it is by Faith that we are ju&s;tified, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.28. and 5.1. And the Wrath of God abideth on Sinners till they believe, <HI>John</HI> 3.36. I therefore conclude, That whatever it be, and by what Names &s;oever call'd, that is required of Sinners in order to their being &s;aved, is what they mu&s;t perform before they are in a State of Salvation, and &s;o while they are in an unregenerate and un|ju&s;tified State: Which is no more than to &s;ay, before God &s;aves them. And when awakened Sinners a&s;k, what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved? as in <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37. and 16.30. this is plainly &s;uppo&s;ed in their Inquiry; and they are confirmed in this by the An&s;wer given to them, being &s;uitable to the Meaning of their Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>In order therefore to my &s;upporting the Hypothe&s;is I have under|taken to defend, it will be nece&s;&s;ary that I do two Things, <HI>viz.</HI> (1) Prove it to be impo&s;&s;ible, that the Condition required of us &s;hould con&s;i&s;t in any Act or Acts to be performed by us, being already born again, and by virtue of that Grace which in our Regeneration we re|ceive. (2) That it is very po&s;&s;ible, that the Condition to this End required of &s;inful Men, &s;hould be performed by them, before they are born of the Spirit; and that, by virtue of &s;uch Aids and Influences as God may afford them by his Word and Spirit, without be&s;towing the Grace of Regeneration on them; and before they receive this Grace: And both the&s;e Things I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to endeavour to confirm in the Pro&s;ecution of the Work, in which I am now engaged. But my pre&s;ent De&s;ign in this Chapter, is briefly to con&s;ider the Nature of tho&s;e Acts, which, I &s;ay, are compri&s;ed in the Condition on which God offers to &s;ave Sinners; and wherein they differ from tho&s;e, which, tho' much better, are not, yea, cannot be, required to that End.</P>
<P>Now here I will <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;hew, what the fundamental Ground and Rea&s;on of the Difference that is between them, is: And then, <HI>&s;e|condly,</HI> wherein the Difference does appear, &s;o far as I am able to di&s;cern and di&s;cover it.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the Rea&s;on and Ground of the Difference betwixt the Acts now to be compared, the Difficulty &s;eems not to be very great; it being evident, that the Rea&s;on thereof is this, that the Acts of &s;uch as are in a regenerate and ju&s;tified E&s;tate, do, or may, flow from an inward Principle of true Holine&s;s; or from a Principle of &s;piritual Life, which, in their new Birth, they have been endowed
<PB N="63" REF="005439_0078_1018315c248891d0">
withal, called in Scripture, as has been declared, the <HI>new Man,</HI> the <HI>new Creature,</HI> a <HI>new Heart,</HI> a <HI>new Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Seed of God,</HI> the <HI>divine Nature,</HI> &amp;c. This Principle, being a &s;piritual and holy Thing, deno|minates the Per&s;ons &s;piritual and holy, who are the Subjects of it; and &s;uch as they are, their Actions are, or may be al&s;o, like the Prin|ciple from which they proceed. On the other Hand, &s;uch as are in a State of Nature, and &s;o de&s;titute of any &s;uch heavenly and divine Principle, as has been now mentioned; and &s;o not &s;piritual, but car|nal, do not, cannot, perform any &s;uch &s;piritual and holy Actions, as &s;uch as are regenerate can do: For Actions cannot be better than the Principle which they proceed or &s;pring from. We are accordingly told, <HI>that that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit, and that which is born of the Fle&s;h is Fle&s;h,</HI> John 3.6. And with this agrees that in Rom. 8.8. <HI>They that are in the Fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e God</HI>: And that al&s;o 1 Cor. 2.14, 15. <HI>The natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God: For they are Fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him; neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned. But he that is &s;piritual judgeth all Things,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Agreeably hereunto the State of Mankind, with Relation to their Actions good and bad, &s;eems to be fully and plainly &s;et forth by our Saviour, Luke 6.43, 44, 45. <HI>For a good Tree bringeth not forth cor|rupt Fruit: Neither doth a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit. For every Tree is known by his own Fruit: For of Thorns Men do not gather Figs, not of a Bramble-Bu&s;h gather they Grapes. A good Man, out of the good Trea&s;ure of his Heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil Man, out of the evil Trea&s;ure of his Heart, bringeth forth that which is evil: For of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth &s;peaketh.</HI> We may doubtle&s;s, from the Scriptures that have been mentioned, conclude it to be a Truth, That, in a proper and &s;trict Sen&s;e, no Actions are holy and good, but what are performed by good or godly Per&s;ons, &s;uch as are <HI>born of God,</HI> or <HI>born of the Spirit</HI>; and which flow from an inward Principle of &s;piritual Life, or true Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet on the other Hand it may be truly affirmed, that &s;ome Actions which may be, and are, performed by Per&s;ons in an unregenerate State, which have &s;omething of Goodne&s;s in them; (tho' of an infe|riour Kind) and are &s;o far acceptable to God, by whom Actions are weighed, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.3. and who perfectly knows what of Good or Evil there is in any of them, and values them accordingly, approving them &s;o far as they are good, and abhorring them &s;o far forth as they are evil. But of this more hereafter: At pre&s;ent my Bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;hew, that there is a <HI>real</HI> Difference betwixt the good Actions of the
<PB N="64" REF="005439_0079_1018310d74eb2a38">
Regenerate, and the be&s;t that can be performed by unregenerate Per|&s;ons; and wherein that Difference lieth.</P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P>I &s;hall here, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> mention three Things, wherein I think the good Actions of the Regenerate greatly differ, and that &s;pecifically, from any that can be performed by unregenerate Per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the Knowledge which the Regenerate have of God and &s;piritual Things is <HI>experimental,</HI> and their other Actions proceed|ing from &s;uch Knowledge, &s;uitable to it; but not &s;o the Unrege|nerate.</P>
<P>I will here con&s;ider, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that <HI>Knowledge</HI> which the Regenerate have of God and Things &s;piritual; and then their other Actions pro|ceeding therefrom.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;ay, the Knowledge of the Regenerate is experimental; which the Knowledge of the Unregenerate is not. Now to clear up this, we may ob&s;erve (1) That the Elect of God have not, in their Conver&s;ion, any other objective Revelation of God, than the Non-Elect, who are never &s;avingly converted. The external Revelation of divine Objects and Truths, which we have in the holy Scriptures, is a &s;ufficient Ground for the Belief and a&s;&s;ured Knowledge of them; &s;o that tho&s;e who do not believe and know them, as they ought to do, cannot plead, that they have not &s;ufficient Evidence of the Truth and Reality of them. If they could truly &s;o plead, this would be a good Rea&s;on for their not believing them, which they evidently cannot have, (I &s;peak of tho&s;e who enjoy the Go&s;pel) as appears in <HI>Luke</HI> 16.27, &mdash;31. Nay, I &s;uppo&s;e it cannot be proved, that when the Elect be|lieve, with a Kind of Faith peculiar to them, they have any other objective Revelation of divine Truths, and Evidence to ground their Faith on, than tho&s;e have who never &s;o believe.</P>
<P N="2">2. Per&s;ons enjoying &s;uch objective Revelation and Evidence of di|vine and &s;piritual Things, need Nothing more of that Kind, in order to believing and knowing them in a gracious and holy Manner, than is afforded to tho&s;e who never &s;o believe. What is further nece&s;&s;ary in order thereunto, is done for them in Regeneration or pa&s;&s;ive Con|ver&s;ion; (of which before) and in the A&s;&s;i&s;tance they have in exer|ci&s;ing the Grace they have &s;o received; unto all which no new ob|jective Revelation is required. This, I &s;ay, is done by God's giving unto Men an <HI>Heart to know him,</HI> Jer. 24.7. and by his <HI>opening their Eyes, to behold wondrous Things out of his Law,</HI> P&s;al. 119.18. And
<PB N="65" REF="005439_0080_1018316191216810">
this God does by working a &s;ubjective Change; that is, he rectifies the Organ, and re&s;tores the depraved Faculty. He does it not by &s;ending new Light, in other objective Revelations, which the Subjects of &s;uch a Change had not before: For it is plainly &s;uppo&s;ed in the Places but now quoted, that Per&s;ons, for whom this is done, have, before the doing it for them, a &s;ufficient objective Revelation of the Things which they are required to believe and know.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Knowledge of &s;piritual Things, in this Way obtained, is <HI>experimental,</HI> and &s;uch as none but the Regenerate have or can have. All the Knowledge which the Unregenerate have, or can have, of divine and &s;piritual Things, called the <HI>deep Things of God,</HI> 2 Cor. 2.10, is quite of another Kind, <HI>viz.</HI> only by a natural A&s;&s;ent on Te&s;ti|mony unto the Truth of the Things believed. And their A&s;&s;urance of &s;uch Things, in this Way, can ari&s;e no higher than their Know|ledge of him that te&s;tifies will lay a Foundation for, and the Rea&s;ons which they do, or may &s;ee of the Credibility of the Things te&s;tified, will be &s;ufficient to produce; which &s;ometimes may be a con&s;iderable Mea&s;ure of Certainty: Yet this is va&s;tly different from, and no Ways comparable to, that experimental Knowledge which the Regenerate do attain.</P>
<P>The Difference betwixt the two Kinds of Knowledge I am &s;peak|ing of, is, I &s;ay, very great and plain, as the Difference is great be|twixt what we know by Report only, and what we know experi|mentally, by Seeing, Feeling, Ta&s;ting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.1. A &s;ick Per&s;on, who&s;e Appetite is vitiated, and who has lo&s;t his Reli&s;h of Meat and Drink; tho' he can believe &s;uch as commend this and the other Sort of either, becau&s;e he reckons them credible; yet cannot have the &s;ame A&s;&s;urance of the Goodne&s;s of the Things he has often heard prai&s;ed, as he has, who being in Health can, and does, expe|rience the Sweetne&s;s of the Things he feeds on, and by which he is &s;trengthned and nouri&s;hed, and &s;o certainly knows the Benefit of.</P>
<P>Thus Sin is a Di&s;ea&s;e, which has deprived Mankind of their Appetite and Reli&s;h of &s;piritual Things; therefore <HI>the carnal Mind is Enmity again&s;t God,</HI> Rom. 8.7. with which we may compare, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.14. but lately mentioned. But in Regeneration, this woful Di&s;temper of Men's Souls is, in a good Mea&s;ure, cured; &s;o that they find and experience the Certainty and Excellency of &s;piritual Objects; and can conver&s;e with them with Plea&s;ure and Delight, as the Scriptures plentifully &s;hew. Such as plea&s;e may read and compare, <HI>Job</HI> 42.5, 6. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 34.8. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.2, 3. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.97. <HI>Cant.</HI> 2.1. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.3.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="005439_0081_10183110775a2e68">From this experimental Knowledge called <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> and <HI>&s;piritual Under&s;tanding,</HI> Col. 1.9. there always proceed &s;uch Actions as are &s;uitable thereunto, and as become tho&s;e that are &s;piritually wi&s;e, &s;uch as are the genuine Fruits and proper Effects of <HI>the Knowledge of the Holy,</HI> mention'd <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.7. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 111.10. <HI>Job</HI> 28.28. al&s;o <HI>Prov.</HI> 2.10, 11, 12.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Thing wherein, I think, the good Actions of the Regenerate differ from the be&s;t that can be performed by any unre|generate Per&s;ons, is this, that they are performed out of &s;uch a Love to God, as has his infinite Perfections for the formal Rea&s;on and Ground of it. Here I &s;hall ob&s;erve, (1) That unregenerate Per&s;ons may perform Actions that are materially good, tho' they have no Love to God at all; yea, tho' they have no Regard to him. It is not to be doubted, but that unregenerate Sinners may believe there is a God; and have a Fear and Dread of him, as well as Devils, <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.19. And out of &s;uch a Fear of him they may yield Obe|dience to his Commands, tho' they love him not. (2) Unregenerate Per&s;ons may have &s;ome Kind of Love to God, which may put them on doing many Things which he requires them to do. There be &s;ome unregenerate Per&s;ons that have a very con&s;iderable Re&s;pect and Veneration for the great God that made them, and continually pre|&s;erves them. They therefore love not to hear his Name bla&s;phemed; and the Kindne&s;s they may apprehend they have received from him, may influence them to do many Things, which they may think good in them&s;elves, and plea&s;ing in his Sight; and they may apprehend that God is &s;o gracious as to reward them well for the good Works which they perform. There may be in the Unregenerate, a Kind of natural Love to God, an&s;werable to the Apprehen&s;ions they have of &s;ome Goodne&s;s in him, as well as &s;uch a Love to their Neighbours; even common Grace may go thus far. (3) But no unregenerate Per&s;on ever loved and obeyed God, on the Account of the admirable Perfections of his Nature; &s;o that his Per&s;ua&s;ion of his infinite Good|ne&s;s, ari&s;ing from his own experimental Acquaintance with him, was the formal Rea&s;on of this his Love to him, and De&s;ire to do that which would plea&s;e him; &s;o that they would do the &s;ame, tho' they them|&s;elves had no Benefit by it. I &s;uppo&s;e, That he that cannot do thus, is &s;till in a State of Nature, and does not know and love God in a gra|cious Manner: And has not, in the Sen&s;e of the Scripture, <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ted that the Lord is gracious,</HI> 1 Pet. 2, 3. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 34.8.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="67" REF="005439_0082_10183164cbc313f0">3. I think the Regenerate only can perform good Actions, with an Aim and De&s;ign to glorify God, as the ultimate End of them. There is, as I think, no Doubt to be made, but that the Unregenerate may, and &s;ometimes do, aim at God's Glory, in &s;ome of their Actions. Such may be per&s;uaded, That to glorify God <HI>here,</HI> is the only Way to obtain eternal Life <HI>hereafter</HI>; and this may put them upon endeavour|ing to glorify God's Name. But none but a gracious Soul can aim at God's Glory, as the ultimate End of what he does; and tho' he &s;hould &s;ee no Advantage to him&s;elf by it. But I think every truly holy Soul would do this. However, God does not require us to aim at his Glory, without any Eye or View to our own Advantage: The&s;e are Things, by God him&s;elf, &s;o joined together, that we ought not to go about to &s;eperate them.</P>
<P>So much may &s;uffice to have &s;aid in this Place, concerning the Difference of the gracious and holy Actions of tho&s;e who are already pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life, and tho&s;e Actions in which, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Condition, on which Salvation is offered unto Sinners, does con&s;i&s;t. This will nece&s;&s;arily be further &s;poken to hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. That <HI>GOD,</HI> in offering <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> with all his Benefits, to &s;inful Men, mu&s;t needs offer them the Grace of <HI>Regeneration.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THAT there is in the Go&s;pel, a gracious Offer of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with all his Benefits, made to Sinners, is, I think, in the Mini&s;try of the Word of God, very frequently a&s;&s;erted, by orthodox Preachers of the Go&s;pel: How agreable to Truth, I &s;hall in this Chapter con&s;ider: And whether, if this be true, it will not from thence follow, That Sinners have in the Go&s;pel, an Offer of the Grace of Regeneration made to them; which is the Point I am endeavouring to maintain.</P>
<P>Now in order to the clearing up of this Truth, I &s;hall (1) &s;hew, That there is, in the Go&s;pel, an Offer of Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf to Sin|ners. (2) That, having an Offer of Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, they have, with him, an Offer of all his Benefits. (3) That, having an Offer of

all his Benefits, they mu&s;t needs have an Offer of the Grace of Re|generation. To the&s;e Things I will &s;peak &s;everally.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;ay Sinners have in the Go&s;pel an Offer of Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf made to them.</P>
<P>This I &s;hall take for granted, it being, as I &s;uppo&s;e, generally ac|knowledged by all that own that Sinners have Salvation conditionally offered to them. In <HI>John</HI> 1.11, 12. we have a plain Proof of this Truth.</P>
<P>But it may be proper here to ob&s;erve, That when it is &s;aid, that Sinners have in the Go&s;pel an Offer of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we mu&s;t not under&s;tand merely his Per&s;on, God-Man; but his Per&s;on con&s;idered as cloathed with his Office of Mediator betwixt God and Mankind; and every Way qualified and enclined to execute that Office; yea, as having undertaken it on the Behalf of all that will receive him, or come up to the Terms on which he is offered to them: The&s;e Names, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> are plainly expre&s;&s;ive of the Office he bears, and his be|ing anointed, or &s;et apart to the Execution of it; the Name <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;ignifying a <HI>Saviour,</HI> and that of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> his being anointed or &s;et apart to his Office: And whenever we &s;peak of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as being offered unto Sinners, we &s;hould not think his Per&s;on only to be under&s;tood, but his Per&s;on cloathed with the Office of a Savi|our, as in Matth. 1.21. <HI>Thou &s;halt call his Name</HI> JESUS; <HI>for he &s;hall &s;ave his People from their Sins.</HI> Now this Office of a Saviour includes in it tho&s;e of Prie&s;t, Prophet, and King.</P>
<P>Nor is Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is offered unto Sinners, to be con&s;idered meerly as cloathed with the Office of a Mediator, but as perfectly qualified for the Execution of it, or Accompli&s;hment of the Work he has undertaken to perform, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>bringing many Sons unto Glory,</HI> Heb. 2.10. To this End <HI>he was made perfect through Sufferings,</HI> as is &s;aid in the &s;ame Ver&s;e; not only as hereby he became a Pat|tern of Patience to his &s;uffering Saints, but more e&s;pecially as by this he laid the Foundation of all that &s;till remained nece&s;&s;ary, in order to their being bro't into a State of perfect Happine&s;s and Glory. Unto this that well agreeth, 1 Pet. 3.18. <HI>For Chri&s;t al&s;o once &s;uf|fered for Sins, the Ju&s;t for the Unju&s;t: that he might bring us to God, being put to Death in the Fle&s;h, but quickened by the Spirit.</HI> To the &s;ame Purpo&s;e it is &s;aid of him, Heb. 5.9. That <HI>being made perfect, he became the Author of eternal Salvation unto all them that obey him.</HI> The Price of Man's Redemption being once paid, their great Saviour might comfortably go on and accompli&s;h all that was further nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="69" REF="005439_0084_10183166560fd3c0">
in order to their Happine&s;s, in their effectual Calling, Ju&s;tification, and Regeneration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>When Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;poken of, as offered to Sinners, we mu&s;t al&s;o con&s;ider him as filled with all that Good which is trea&s;ured up in him, to be communicated to all tho&s;e whom he eternally &s;aves. <HI>For it hath plea&s;ed the Father, that in him all Fulne&s;s &s;hould dwell,</HI> Col. 1.19. And <HI>in him are hid all the Trea&s;ures of Wi&s;dom and Knowledge,</HI> Chap. 2.30. And we are told, in John 1.14. That he was <HI>full of Grace and Truth.</HI> And in ver&s;e 16. &s;uch as have an Intere&s;t in him are bro't in &s;aying, <HI>Of his Fulne&s;s have all we received, and Grace for Grace.</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t is indeed that <HI>Fountain</HI> of &s;piritual Good, of which we read, <HI>Zech.</HI> 13.1. In him therefore <HI>all our Springs are,</HI> P&s;al. 87.7. He is a full Repo&s;itory of all tho&s;e good Things that needy Souls can de&s;ire, and look out after; and unto all, to whom he is Offered, he is offered full as he is.</P>
<P N="2">2. Together with, and in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Sinners have an Offer of <HI>all his Benefits.</HI> This is indeed a plain Con&s;equence of what is above &s;aid, <HI>viz.</HI> That Sinners have an Offer of Chri&s;t with all his Fulne&s;s. But for the further clearing of this Point, we mu&s;t here con&s;ider, (1) What we may here under&s;tand by Chri&s;t's Benefits. (2) How it appears that the&s;e are all offered unto Sinners in and with him.</P>
<P N="1">(1) Let us here con&s;ider what we are to under&s;tand by Chri&s;t's Benefits. Now unto this, in a Word, I &s;ay, That by the&s;e Benefits, I under&s;tand, all tho&s;e &s;pecial and everla&s;ting Mercies, which God be&s;tows on all, and only tho&s;e, whom he eternally &s;aves; and which are called <HI>Things that accompany Salvation,</HI> Heb. 6.9. What the&s;e Things are, I have more particularly &s;hown, Part I. and Chap. II. of this E&s;&s;ay, where it appears, Page 30. That Man's Salvation contains in it, as an eminent Part of it, his Deliverance from the reigning Power and Dominion of Sin, in and by his Regeneration. Such as plea&s;e may &s;ee what is there &s;aid, but much rather what the Scripture &s;ays, <HI>Matth.</HI> 1.21. <HI>Tit.</HI> 2.14. and <HI>Chap.</HI> 3.5.</P>
<P N="2">(2) I mu&s;t &s;hew that all the&s;e Benefits, not any one of them ex|cepted, are in the Go&s;pel offered unto Sinners in and with Je&s;us Chri&s;t. They cannot be either offered or given in any other Way, than that now expre&s;s'd. I mean, That, according to the Way which God has &s;tated in the Go&s;pel, they cannot. The natural Order and Rea&s;on of Things will not admit that they &s;hould. For,</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="005439_0085_10183118b5d7b4e8"><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The&s;e Things being all repo&s;ited in Chri&s;t, as has been &s;hewn, there can, I &s;uppo&s;e, be no Way &s;hewed, how any Per&s;on can be a Partaker of any of them, without being made Partaker of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in whom they are all trea&s;ured up. Tho&s;e therefore that have an Intere&s;t in any of them, are &s;aid in Scripture to have the &s;ame in him. And it would be prepo&s;terous in any Per&s;on to de&s;ire, or la|bour to obtain, any of them, in any other Way, than by getting an Intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf. Tho&s;e that have an Intere&s;t in any one of tho&s;e Things, are therefore in Scripture &s;aid to have them in him. In him they have their Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Strength, and their Life, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 45.24, 25. 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.11. <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.20.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Union with Chri&s;t is therefore nece&s;&s;ary in order to Per|&s;ons being Partakers of any of the&s;e Benefits. Never did any one Soul partake of any of them, without being fir&s;t united to Chri&s;t. They are all conveyed from him as the Head of his Church, which is his Body, unto the Members of it; or as from a Vine to it's Bran|ches. For this the Scriptures are full and plain, as may be &s;een, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.18, 19. and <HI>Chap.</HI> 2.19. <HI>John</HI> 1.16. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.22, 23. See al&s;o <HI>John</HI> 15.1,&mdash;6.</P>
<P>But there being &s;everal Sen&s;es in which Per&s;ons may be &s;aid to be united to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion in my next Chapter di&s;tinctly to con&s;ider them, and &s;hew, in what Sen&s;e Per&s;ons mu&s;t be united to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, before they can partake of any of his &s;pecial Benefits. At Pre&s;ent it is &s;ufficient to my Purpo&s;e that the Scriptures are plain and full, That Union with, or to, him is nece&s;&s;ary to that End; and that he mu&s;t become our's in Order to our partaking of any of his &s;pecial Favours: Even as a Woman mu&s;t marry a Man, in order to her having &s;uch an Intere&s;t in his E&s;tate, as Wives have in the E&s;tate of their Hu&s;bands. And thus much may &s;uffice for my fourth Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. That neither the Grace of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> nor any Act flowing from it, or by which it is implied, is the Condition on which Salva|tion is offered to Sinners, and con&s;equently the &s;ame mu&s;t be comprehended in the Sal|vation offered to them.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING in the foregoing Chapter endeavoured to prove, That Sinners have in the Go&s;pel, an Offer of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and all his Benefits made to them; and con&s;equently, of Regeneration, which is one of the principal of them: I am apprehen&s;ive there is one Exception that will be apt to be made again&s;t the Ar|gument there in&s;i&s;ted on, <HI>viz.</HI> That Regeneration it&s;elf, (or which is in Effect the &s;ame Thing, an Act of Faith flowing from it, or im|plying it) is the Condition on which the Offer of Salvation is made; and con&s;equently cannot be compri&s;ed in the Salvation offered; be|cau&s;e one and the &s;ame Thing cannot be both the Condition on which Salvation is offered, and the Benefit it&s;elf to be obtained on that Con|dition; I intend, in this Chapter, not only to &s;how the Faultine&s;s of &s;uch an Objection; but al&s;o to make &s;ome Advantage of the Con&s;e|quence made u&s;e of in it, for the Support of the Hypothe&s;is which it is de&s;igned to overthrow.</P>
<P>I then readily acknowledge, That the &s;ame Thing cannot be both the Condition on which Salvation is offered, and either a Part or the Whole of the Salvation offered on it. If therefore it can be proved, That either Regeneration it&s;elf, or any Act flowing from it or implyed in it, is required of Sinners, as the Condition on which Salvation is offered to them, it will plainly follow, that it can be no Part of the Salvation, on that Condition offered.&mdash;But then, on the other
<PB N="72" REF="005439_0087_1018311b319924c0">
Hand, if it is or may be &s;ufficiently proved, that Regeneration is a Part, and an eminent and principal Part too, of the Salvation offer|ed in the Go&s;pel, it will as firmly follow, that it cannot be the Con|dition on which God offers that Salvation. If therefore I have proved, as I think I have, That Regeneration is compri&s;ed in the Salvation of|fered to Sinners; or if I can &s;till, as I intend, make good this A&s;&s;er|tion, then it will appear not to be compri&s;ed or implied in the Con|dition. However, if I have not yet proved this in the Way expre&s;&s;ed, I hope I &s;hall &s;ufficiently evince it in what remains to be &s;poken in this Chapter.</P>
<P>To go on therefore, there are now two Things before me to be made good, <HI>viz.</HI> (1) That neither the Grace of Regeneration, nor any Act flowing from it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered to Sinners. (2) That from hence this Conclu&s;ion followeth, That the Grace given in Regeneration mu&s;t needs be compri&s;ed in the Salvation offered: &mdash; And the&s;e Things I &s;hall endeavour &s;everally to illu&s;trate and confirm.</P>
<P N="1">1. I will endeavour to &s;hew that neither the Grace of Regeneration, nor any Act flowing from it, and &s;o involved and implied in it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered, as above.</P>
<P N="1">(1) I &s;ay, the Grace of Regeneration it&s;elf, cannot be the Conditi|on on which God offers Salvation to &s;inful Men. For <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Condition on which Salvation is offered to Sinners, is &s;omething re|quired of them to be done by them, which the Grace of Regeneration is not. The Condition required of Sinners is &s;omething which they are directed to do, in An&s;wer to &s;uch Enquiries of awakened Souls as the&s;e, <HI>What &s;hall we do?</HI> Acts 2.37. and, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI> Acts 16.30. It is &s;omething called in Scripture <HI>Believing, Repenting, Obeying, Seeking the Lord, Calling on his Name,</HI> &amp;c. as I have formerly &s;hewed. But the Grace of Regeneration is no act at all, either of God, or of the Sinner, tho' it be God's Gift. It is an infu&s;ed Habit or Principle, by which they that have it are di&s;po&s;ed to act as they &s;hould do, not their acting. For it is called in Scripture, <HI>a new Heart, a new Spirit, the new Creature, the Seed of God, the Image of God, the divine Nature,</HI> &amp;c. none of which Words or Names &s;ignify Actions, but a Principle of Grace or Holine&s;s wrought in Men's Souls by the Holy Spirit, <HI>creating them anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works, that they &s;hould walk in them,</HI> Eph. 2.10. and Ezek. 36.26, 27. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Grace of Regeneration cannot be the Condition on
<PB N="73" REF="005439_0088_10181068058ab768">
which Salvation is offered to Sinners, becau&s;e they cannot have it be|fore they are in a State of Salvation; which to its being a Condition on which Salvation is offered, is nece&s;&s;arily required. But this will by and by be made further evident.</P>
<P N="2">(2) No Act flowing from the Grace of Regeneration, or imply|ing it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered. No &s;uch Act, I mean, as any Per&s;on performs by the Help of that Grace, which, in his Regeneration, he receives. And to make good what I here a&s;&s;ert, I will &s;hew, (1) That if that could be which is here de|nied, then a Sinner might be vitally united to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, while he has no Covenant-Intere&s;t in him. And (2) Then al&s;o might a Sinner be <HI>born of God,</HI> and <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> before he is ju&s;tified by the Im|putation of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to him: Neither of which can be true, or may by any Means be admitted.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;ay, if any Act, or Acts, flowing from the Grace of Regene|ration, or implying it, were the Condition on which Salvation is offered, then it would follow, that a Per&s;on may be <HI>vitally</HI> united to Chri&s;t before he has any Covenant-Intere&s;t in him and his Benefits; which mu&s;t be denied. I &s;uppo&s;e there are &s;carce any of our Divines that will deny this Con&s;equence, becau&s;e the Conclu&s;ion or Inference is, what they generally hold and maintain: For they think an Act of Faith, flowing from a Principle of Grace given in Regeneration, is required in order to our Salvation; nor do they at all doubt, but that all in whom a Principle of Grace is wrought, are vitally united unto Chri&s;t, and that before they have any Covenant-Intere&s;t in him: For they &s;uppo&s;e it to be impo&s;&s;ible, that any Per&s;on &s;hould have a Covenant-Intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t that has not believed in him, and this with that Kind of Faith which is given in Regeneration; and which can be only exerted by a regenerate Soul. It is not therefore &s;uppo&s;ed, that there is any Ab&s;urdity in the Inference I draw from the Propo&s;ition I oppo&s;e. What, therefore, is here incumbent on me is to &s;how, that it is impo&s;&s;ible that any Per&s;on &s;hould be vitally united to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, before he has a Covenant-Intere&s;t in him; and con|&s;equently &s;uch a Right to his Benefits al&s;o.</P>
<P>I will therefore here endeavour to make it manife&s;t, that this is impo&s;&s;ible. And to this End I will briefly &s;hew (1) What I take to be imported in a vital Union to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. (2) What I intend by a Covenant-Intere&s;t in him. And then I will &s;hew (3) How un|rea&s;onable
<PB N="74" REF="005439_0089_101831200990e210">
it is to imagine, That a Per&s;on that has not &s;uch an In|tere&s;t in Chri&s;t and his Benefits, may yet be vitally united to him.</P>
<P N="1">1. And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> I will here &s;hew, what I &s;uppo&s;e to be imported in that vital Union with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whereof I here &s;peak.</P>
<P>Now to this I &s;ay, (1) That this imports that the great Work of Regeneration is really wrought in &s;uch a Soul; or that he is born of God, born of the Spirit; that God has given him a new Heart, and a new Spirit; re&s;tored his Image in him, which he had lo&s;t by the Fall; endowed him with a Principle of &s;piritual Life; planted the Seed of Grace in his Soul; made him Partaker of the divine Nature. All this mu&s;t needs be implied in a vital Union with Je&s;us Chri&s;t: For it is by the Soul's Conformity to the Image of the Son of God, or by his having Chri&s;t formed in him, that this his Union with him is bro't about or effected. We are therefore told, that <HI>he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit,</HI> 1 Cor. 6.17. (2) Such as the&s;e are actually be|come the Temples of the Holy Gho&s;t, having the Spirit of God, Father and Son, dwelling in them, as in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.15, 16, 17, and ver. 19. And God dwells and walks in them, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.16. So that they are become an Habitation of God thro' the Spirit, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.22. and Chri&s;t lives in them, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.20. (3) Such as the&s;e have already eternal Life; and &s;hall not come into Condemnation, but are already pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life, and have eternal Life abiding in them, &s;o that they &s;hall never die. See <HI>John</HI> 5.24. 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.14, 15. and Chap. 5.12. al&s;o <HI>John</HI> 11. 25, 26. (4) Such as the&s;e God has already began to glorify, as plainly appears, 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>The Spirit of God and of Glory re&s;teth on them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I mu&s;t next &s;hew, what I intend by a Covenant-Intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Benefits: And here, in general, I &s;ay, I hereby intend a ju&s;t Right and Title to them, by the Promi&s;es of God in the new Covenant; and that unto Men's having &s;uch a Right, their Performance of the Condition on which Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Benefits are offered, or conditionally promi&s;ed, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Now, with Re&s;pect to this Intere&s;t in, or Right to, Chri&s;t and his Benefits, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;everal Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> this &s;uppo&s;eth, that there are, in the Go&s;pel, condi|tional Offers and Promi&s;es made of the&s;e Things unto &s;inful Men, plainly importing, that they &s;hall become theirs on the Performance of the Condition or Conditions to that End required of them. But on this I need not enlarge, having before &s;poken fully to it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="75" REF="005439_0090_10183171f395bbf8">2. That the&s;e Conditions mu&s;t be performed before a Right can be had to the Things conditionally promi&s;ed. The very Notion of a conditional Offer or Promi&s;e does plainly imply &s;o much.</P>
<P N="3">3. I acknowledge, that, according to my Hypothe&s;is, a Sinner mu&s;t, in order to his having &s;uch a Right, perform the now intended Condition, before he has the great Work of Regeneration wrought in him; and con&s;equently, Strength given to him in his Regeneration is not required in order to it: Yet I believe, that, in order to this, a Sinner needs the Help and Influences of God, by his Word and Spirit.</P>
<P N="4">4. Sinners can have no Right to any of the Benefits purcha&s;ed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t for them, and laid up in him, 'till they have a Right to, and Intere&s;t in him&s;elf, as has been already &s;hewed.</P>
<P N="5">5. Union with Je&s;us Chri&s;t is al&s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in order to our partaking of his &s;pecial Benefits. They are all communicated by, and derived from him, as he is Head of his Church, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.18, 19. and Chap. 2.19. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.22, 23. al&s;o <HI>John</HI> 15. from the Beginning to Ver&s;e 6.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Grace of Regeneration cannot be received from Chri&s;t, by his People, as their <HI>vital Head,</HI> or as being in &s;uch a vital Union with him as I lately de&s;cribed. This is mo&s;t obvious, becau&s;e no Per&s;on is &s;o united to him, 'till he is regenerate or born again; it being by the Be&s;towment of the Grace of Regeneration on any Soul, that &s;uch an Union with Chri&s;t is brought about or effected. It is by putting his holy Spirit into &s;ome of the Children of Men, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t unites them to him&s;elf; and thus all that are <HI>joined to the Lord are one Spirit</HI> with him: And hence it appears, that they receive not the Grace of Regeneration from him, as being, in this Sen&s;e their Head; but to the End he may be &s;o, and they his Members.</P>
<P>It is therefore by a <HI>foederal Union</HI> with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that his Peo|ple are made Partakers of regenerating Grace. That Union with him is to this End nece&s;&s;ary, I have already &s;hewed. All his Benefits are communicated to his People, as from a Head to its Members, and without &s;ome Union with him, none of his &s;aving Benefits can be received by them. But it is evident, that in order to their receiving the Grace of Regeneration, they can have no other than a relative Union to him; and this can be no other than a foederal Union with him: And this, I &s;ay, they may and mu&s;t have, before they can par|take of regenerating Grace.</P>
<P>What I have here &s;aid I &s;hall endeavour to make good by the fol|lowing Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="76" REF="005439_0091_101831251a6848d0">1. There is a <HI>covenant</HI> as well as a <HI>vital Union</HI> betwixt Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his People. That there is a vital Union betwixt him and them, is generally acknowledged among us. This I have &s;poken of before in Page 34. That there is al&s;o a Covenant-Union betwixt our Savi|our and his People, I &s;uppo&s;e to be likewi&s;e acknowledged; and this is that of which I here &s;peak, and the Nature whereof I would explain.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here then, in the fir&s;t Place, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, That there is a Covenant-Union betwixt God and &s;ome of the Children of Men, immediately ari&s;ing, or re&s;ulting, from a mutual Agreement or Sti|pulation betwixt him and them, which does not of it &s;elf entitle tho&s;e who are taken into it, to any of the &s;aving Benefits of the Covenant entred into. This will be manife&s;t if the Nature of the Covenant intended (I mean the Covenant of Grace) be a little con&s;idered; and who the Parties are that are engaged in it.</P>
<P>And, in general, I here &s;ay, that the Covenant by which this Union is brought about, being conditional, the Union intended can|not be effected, 'till the Condition be performed. The Covenant I here intend is the new Covenant, or the Covenant of Grace; and this is a conditional Covenant, as I have &s;ufficiently proved in the fir&s;t Part of this E&s;&s;ay. In this Je&s;us Chri&s;t and all his Benefits are con|ditionally promi&s;ed to &s;inful Men. The Condition therein required of Sinners, is that they lay hold on the Covenant, or &s;ubmit to the Terms of it, and then perform what is required in it, in order to their en|joying the Good of it. What that is which is required, has already been &s;ufficiently declared. By doing this, Sinners obtain a Right to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with all his Benefits offered to them; and &s;o have &s;uch a Relation to him as they never had before. And in this Relation, whereof I now &s;peak, their covenant Union with him, which I here intend, does con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall endeavour to clear up this more fully by a brief Ob&s;er|vation of &s;everal Things here following, as (1) That there is a cove|nant Relation betwixt God and his People, which does immediately ari&s;e and re&s;ult from their taking hold of the Covenant, or &s;ubmitting to the Terms of it. Tho' God does, in the Go&s;pel, offer to enter into Covenant with Sinners, this C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">enant is not actually made be|twixt him and them, 'till there be a Con&s;ent of both Parties to the Terms of it.

betwixt him and them, as in <HI>Deut.</HI> 26.17, 18. In the Language of the new Te&s;tament, this is done by a profe&s;&s;ed Sub|jection to the Go&s;pel, and our being baptized in (or into) the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.13. and <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.19. Now, tho' hereby there is a covenant Relation and Union brought about or effected betwixt God and the Sinners thus taking hold of the Covenant, as is expre&s;&s;ed in the Places quoted; yet this is not that Union with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which I principally here intend: For Per&s;ons may be thus joined to the Lord, and yet never be &s;aved, as appears, <HI>John</HI> 15.1,&mdash;6. and <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.3, 4. and &s;everal other Places. Wherefore (2) There is yet a nearer covenant Re|lation, or foederal Union betwixt Chri&s;t and his People, than that which has been now mentioned, which is come into when Men come up to the Terms, or perform the Condition, on which Chri&s;t and his Benefits are, in the Go&s;pel, offered to them. For whereas, 'till this is done, God's covenant People are but in a State of Probation, in order to their obtaining the everla&s;ting Mercies offered to them in the new Covenant, on a Condition yet depending, not being fulfilled; they having now performed that Condition, have a real and ju&s;t Right to all that Good, of which before they had no more than a conditional Promi&s;e made to them.</P>
<P>Having thus declared what I intend, both by that vital and cove|nant Union, which is betwixt Chri&s;t and tho&s;e belonging to him, I &s;hall proceed,</P>
<P N="3">3. To &s;hew how unrea&s;onable a Thing it is for any to imagine it po&s;&s;ible, that a Per&s;on who has no &s;uch covenant Intere&s;t in, or Rela|tion to, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as that but now de&s;cribed, may yet be vitally united to him, in the Manner before Expre&s;&s;ed, (Page 74.) A Per|&s;on vitally united to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is made an actual Partaker of him, and Chri&s;t has taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Soul, to dwell and walk in for ever: They who are thus joined to the Lord are one Spirit with him, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.17. and &s;o in &s;uch a Union as that mentioned by Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, in John 17.21, 22, 23. <HI>That they may be one, as thou, Father, art in me and I in thee, that they may be one in us:&mdash; and the Glory which thou gave&s;t me, I have given them: that they may be one, even as we are one. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</HI> And &s;uch a Union as that al&s;o by him intended, Rev. 3.20. <HI>Behold I &s;tand at the Door and knock, if any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in to him, and will &s;up with him, and he with me.</HI> &mdash; Is it po&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould enjoy Chri&s;t, in &s;uch an Union with him? For my part, I am otherwi&s;e per&s;uaded.
<PB N="78" REF="005439_0093_10183128038cc870">
If Sinners may be thus made Partakers of Chri&s;t, before they have any covenant Intere&s;t in him, or Right to his Benefits, What Occa|&s;ion is there of a conditional Offer of him to be made to them in the Go&s;pel? And how unaccountable is it, that any do affirm, That Sinners mu&s;t be vitally united to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, before they can have a covenant Right to him; yea, before they can perform the Condi|tion on which he is offered in the Go&s;pel? I cannot think that &s;uch an Union with Chri&s;t, in order to our having a covenant Intere&s;t in him and his Benefits, is nece&s;&s;ary; but on the contrary, That our having a covenant Intere&s;t in him is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to our having &s;uch a vital Union with him: And that Sinners, who are eternally &s;aved, do not perform the Condition on which Chri&s;t is offered, after they are thus united to him, but in order to their being &s;o. Chri&s;t &s;tands and knocks at the Sinner's Door, and the Sinner opens to him before he comes in to him, as appears by the Text lately mentioned, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.20. If it be &s;aid, that no Man can po&s;&s;ibly open his Heart to Chri&s;t, by any A&s;&s;i&s;tances he can receive from him, until Chri&s;t be vitally united to him; as this is to beg the Thing in Que&s;tion, &s;o it &s;eems to contradict the Text, which &s;uppo&s;eth the Sinner to open to Chri&s;t knocking at the Door of his Heart, before he enters, and takes up his Abode in it. Chri&s;t can knock loud enough to &s;tir up the Sinner to open to him, before he actually enters and takes Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Soul.</P>
<P>There is one Thing more here nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid, before I pro|ceed to another Argument; <HI>viz.</HI> That tho' a <HI>covenant</HI> Union to, or with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, be only nece&s;&s;ary, in order to a Sinner's partaking of the Grace of Regeneration, or indeed po&s;&s;ible to be had; yet that Grace being once received, all future Supplies of more of the &s;ame Kind flow from him to his Members, as <HI>vitally</HI> united to him, and living Members of that my&s;tical Body, whereof he is the living Head. Hence it is that many Texts of Scripture, which &s;peak of tho&s;e In|fluences and Supplies of Grace, which Chri&s;t's Members receive from him, do plainly &s;uppo&s;e and imply their being in a State of vital Union with him, as <HI>John</HI> 1.16. and <HI>Chap.</HI> 15. <HI>v.</HI> 1,&mdash;6. But &s;uch Union cannot be nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>fir&s;t Grace,</HI> but that is nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>it,</HI> as being immediately effected by it.</P>
<P>I now proceed to a &s;econd Argument, to prove, That no Act or Acts flowing from the Grace of Regeneration, or implied in it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered. And the Argu|ment which I &s;hall now make u&s;e of is this, That if this might be,
<PB N="79" REF="005439_0094_1018317b9bcce9b0">
then may Sinners be made Partakers of the Grace of Regeneration, <HI>before</HI> they are ju&s;tified by the Imputation of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to them, which it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be. Note here, that, by <HI>before,</HI> as formerly, I intend <HI>before,</HI> in order of Nature, and not in re&s;pect of Time. I acknowledge that in this Sen&s;e, the&s;e Mer|cies are granted together, and at once; but if we re&s;pect the natural Order of their being given, Ju&s;tification or Ab&s;olution from the Guilt of Sin, goes before the other.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to make this good, I will, for preventing Mi&s;takes, take Notice of a nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;tinction, with Re&s;pect to Man's Ju&s;ti|fication before God, or by him. That which I intend is this, That by our Ju&s;tification we may under&s;tand, either our Ju&s;tification by the Imputation of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to us, or our being ac|counted and declared righteous, on the Account of our Intere&s;t in that Righteou&s;ne&s;s, after the Imputation thereof. As the&s;e are Things evidently di&s;tingui&s;hable, in re&s;pect of the Nature and Order of them; &s;o they are no le&s;s plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed in the holy Word of God. Ju&s;tification, in Scripture, &s;ometimes &s;ignifies the making of a Man righteous, by the Imputation of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to him, or by the Gift of that Righteou&s;ne&s;s conferred on him, as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.17. And this agrees well with the Meaning of the Word; for, as to glorify &s;ignifies to make glorious, &s;o to ju&s;tify &s;ignifies to make ju&s;t or righteous; and this is in Scripture u&s;ed for a Sinner's being made ju&s;t or righteous, by the Imputation of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to him, Rom. 4.5, 6. <HI>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth the Ungodly, his Faith is counted to him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>: Even as <HI>David</HI> al&s;o de&s;cribeth the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the Man unto whom God imputeth Righteou&s;ne&s;s without Works. Thus &s;uch as are unju&s;t and ungodly before, and until they are ju&s;tified, are by their Ju&s;tification made righteous, by a Righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to them, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t being unto and upon them, as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.22.</P>
<P>But then, Ju&s;tification is &s;ometimes in Scripture taken for the de|claring and pronouncing one righteous, who really is &s;o, before &s;uch a Sentence is pronounced: And in this Sen&s;e, to ju&s;tify, is a foren&s;ick Word or Term, taken from Courts of Ju&s;tice, and is in that Sen&s;e commonly u&s;ed among Men. In this Sen&s;e of the Word, Men never &s;hould, and God never does ju&s;tify any, but tho&s;e who are ju&s;t before &s;uch Ju&s;tification. <HI>For he that ju&s;tifieth the Wicked, and he that con|demneth the Ju&s;t, even they both are an Abomination to the Lord,</HI> Prov. 17.15. Taking Ju&s;tification in this Sen&s;e, a Man mu&s;t be ju&s;t and
<PB N="80" REF="005439_0095_1018312b8122f460">
holy too, before God will ju&s;tify him. And there is no Doubt to me, but that when the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> affirms, That a Man is ju&s;tified by Works, he u&s;eth the Word in this Sen&s;e: For thus God ju&s;tifieth none but &s;uch as have both an imputed and an inherent Righteou&s;ne&s;s. But in the fir&s;t Sen&s;e mentioned, which is that in which I u&s;e the Word in this Di&s;cour&s;e, a Man has no true Righteou&s;ne&s;s at all before God ju&s;tifieth him, by the Imputation of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t to him: And thus, for God to ju&s;tify the Ungodly, is a Word or Term peculiar to the Go&s;pel; and is never u&s;ed in any Courts <HI>of</HI> Ju&s;tice among Men, that I know of.</P>
<P>This being the Sen&s;e in which I u&s;e the Word, as I intimated, what I here affirm is, That a Sinner is not, cannot be regenerated by the Spirit of God, or born of the Spirit, before he is ju&s;tified; and con|&s;equently no Act flowing from the Grace of Regeneration, or im|plying it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered, or given: And I will endeavour to make good both the Antecedent and Con&s;e|quence, or Inference from it.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;ay, That no Sinner is, or can be regenerated by the Spirit of God, before he is ju&s;tified by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t imputed to him; or that Ju&s;tification is, in Order of Nature, before Regenera|tion, and not after it.</P>
<P>To make this good, I will &s;hew, that it will not con&s;i&s;t with that perpetual or &s;tanding Rule of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which God entred into with Mankind in <HI>Adam,</HI> while in Innocence, to regenerate &s;inful Men by his holy Spirit, while they are in an unju&s;tified E&s;tate&punc; And this I &s;hall endeavour to clear up in &s;everal Ob&s;ervations, which here follow.</P>
<P N="1">(1) The Covenant of Works which God entred into with Man|kind while in Innocency, was de&s;igned to be a &s;tanding Rule of rela|tive Ju&s;tice, betwixt him&s;elf and them, according to which he would deal with them for ever. This has been well ob&s;erved and a&s;&s;erted by the learned and very judicious Mr. SAMUEL WILLARD, in his Expo&s;ition of the A&s;&s;emblies Catechi&s;m, (Page 150.) Hence all God's Tran&s;actions with Mankind have hitherto been, and ever will be ordered according to that &s;tanding Rule. If therefore, there could not have been a Way found out wherein the Ju&s;tice of God, and the Honour of his Law might have been vindicated, yea, every Tittle of that Law fulfilled, as in <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.17, 18. no Fle&s;h could have been &s;aved. With this agreeth what we have in <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.26, and <HI>v.</HI> 31. al&s;o <HI>Chap.</HI> 8. <HI>v.</HI> 4.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="81" REF="005439_0096_1018317e41e77510">2. According to the Tenor of this now mentioned Covenant, a perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s was required in order to Man's having Life and Happine&s;s; and Death was threatned for the lea&s;t Offence again&s;t it, as appears in <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. and <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10, 12.</P>
<P N="3">3. By &s;inning again&s;t God, Man forfeited and lo&s;t that Life, which, in a Way of Obedience, he might have obtained, and became &s;ubject to Death: In which Death not only <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> them&s;elves, but all their Po&s;terity were involved, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12. and Chap. 3.23. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Death which by Sin Mankind brought upon them&s;elves, included in it, as one &s;pecial Part or Branch of it, the Lo&s;s of God's Image, and the Corruption and Depravation of Man's Nature, which we call <HI>habitual Corruption,</HI> or <HI>original Sin.</HI> This, I &s;uppo&s;e, I have &s;ufficiently proved in Part I. Chap. I. of this E&s;&s;ay. Here let it be remarked, (1) That the Sin by which Mankind lo&s;t their Right or Title to Life, or rather, by which they fell &s;hort of a Right to it, was their eating the forbidden Fruit. By this Sin the Covenant of Works was wholly broken, and the Life promi&s;ed, utterly lo&s;t, and the Death threatned, fully merited. (2) Man's loo&s;ing and being deprived of God's Image, the before mentioned Depravation of his Nature, was no Part of this Sin, but a penal Effect and Con&s;equent of it, as I have &s;hewed in the former Part of this E&s;&s;ay. Indeed this Corruption of Man's Nature, after his Fall, does very much con&s;i&s;t in it, as well as in his actual Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and the &s;ame may be &s;aid concerning the Devils. But what I &s;ay here is, that the Depra|vation or Corruption of Man's Nature was not the Sin by which he brake the Covenant of Works, but a Puni&s;hment of it.</P>
<P>Indeed Man, after his Fall, went on &s;inning again&s;t the moral Law, con&s;idered as a Rule of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; but the Covenant of Works, as a Covenant, he could not more effectually break than he had already done. Nor did God after Man's Fall, require Obedience of him, as the Condition of that Covenant which he had already bro|ken, and the Good whereof he had already forfeited, but treated with him wholly on the Foot, and according to the Terms, of a new Covenant, which he had begun to reveal and make known to him, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15. For had it not been for this, there would have been no Room left for any Treaty with Sinners, in order to their Obedience and Happine&s;s. All that could have remained would have been the full Execution of that Sentence of Death on Mankind, which they
<PB N="82" REF="005439_0097_1018312e5b4eefb0">
had already begun to feel the Effects of. Plea&s;e to compare what I have now &s;aid, with Part I. Chap. I. Page 22, 23.</P>
<P N="5">5. If a Man may be made Partaker of a Principle of &s;piritual Life, one Moment in Time, or Rea&s;on, before he has an Intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his meritorious Righteou&s;ne&s;s, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why he may not have this Life for ever, and that in its full Perfection, without ever having any Intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s at all. If we may begin to enjoy &s;uch a Life, without fir&s;t having any Inte|re&s;t in Chri&s;t, why may we not enjoy the &s;ame Life forever, without having any Intere&s;t in him? And then, what great Need have we of him, who <HI>is the Head of the Body, the Church: Who is the Beginning, the Fir&s;t-born from the Dead, that in all Things he might have the Pre-eminence,</HI> Col. 1.18.</P>
<P>Having now, as I think, &s;ufficiently &s;hewn the Impo&s;&s;ibility of any Per&s;on's being regenerated by the Spirit of God, 'till he is fir&s;t (in order of Nature) ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to him; I mu&s;t now proceed to make good the Con&s;equence which I drew from that A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>viz.</HI> That no Act flowing from the Grace given in Re|generation, or implying it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered: And this is &s;o evident a Conclu&s;ion, from the Propo&s;ition from whence I infer it, that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to be made more evident, by any Thing that can be &s;aid to make it manife&s;t. Is it not obvious to common Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on, that the Performance of the Condition, on which any Benefit is offered, mu&s;t go, at lea&s;t, in order of Nature, before the obtaining &s;uch a Benefit? If then Ju&s;tifica|tion be, in order of Nature, before Regeneration, how &s;hould any Act flowing from the Grace given in Regeneration, or implying it, be the Condition on which Ju&s;tification and Salvation are offered to Sinners?</P>
<P>But when I have thus argued, I have been &s;ometimes told, That Ju&s;tification and Regeneration are both together in Time, and that my Di&s;tinction of one of the&s;e being, in order of Nature, before the other, is too nice and critical. To which I an&s;wer, That there are Hundreds of other Ca&s;es, wherein learned Men do not think &s;uch a Di&s;tinction too nice; as when Sinners are told, that they mu&s;t come to, and believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, before they may expect to be ju&s;tified; when yet, tho&s;e that tell them &s;o do believe and teach, that a Sinner no &s;ooner lays hold on Chri&s;t by Faith, than he is freely ju&s;tified. And in the very Ca&s;e, on which I am here di&s;cour&s;ing, the learned

Dr. OWEN, di&s;puting with Mr. BAXTER, &s;ays,

<Q>I <HI>profe&s;s</HI> that we are ab&s;olved, <HI>pardoned</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tified,</HI> for Chri&s;t's Sake, and therefore Chri&s;t is <HI>reckoned</HI> to <HI>us,</HI> or <HI>made Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to <HI>us,</HI> in order of Nature, <HI>antecedently</HI> to all tho&s;e Things which for his Sake we do receive, and are made <HI>Partakers of</HI> with and by him, &amp;c.</Q>
The&s;e Quotations may be found in Dr. OWEN's An|&s;wer to Mr. BAXTER, annexed to his An&s;wer to BIDDLE, Page 27. and 43. Whereunto agreeth what is &s;aid by the excellent Mr. BURROUGHS, in his Book of Go&s;pel Remi&s;&s;ion, Page 25.
<Q>God pardons a Sinner, not becau&s;e he is changed, but that he may be changed.</Q>
He frequently a&s;&s;erts the &s;ame Thing in that Book of his, alledging for what he affirms, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.5. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.13. <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.33, 34.</P>
<P>It is indeed a Truth, that if by Man's Salvation we only under|&s;tand his Happine&s;s in his Communion with God, either in this Life, or in that which is to come; his Regeneration mu&s;t then be con&s;i|dered as a Condition of, or Pre-requi&s;ite unto, his Salvation, not as a covenant Condition, but as a Thing phy&s;ically nece&s;&s;ary in order to his Happine&s;s, as being that without which he can neither know Things &s;piritual, nor take any real Delight and Plea&s;ure in them. See 1 Cor. 2.14, 15. and Job 27.10. <HI>Will he Delight him&s;elf in the Almighty?</HI> Heaven it &s;elf could not give Satisfaction to an unregene|rate and unholy Soul. As &s;uch cannot with Plea&s;ure conver&s;e with God and Things &s;piritual here, &s;o neither could they in Heaven, could they get thither.</P>
<P>Men's Salvation does not therefore con&s;i&s;t only in the &s;etting &s;uch Objects before him, as are very delightful to true Saints, but al&s;o in preparing them to receive and entertain them with &s;uch Plea&s;ure and Delight, as &s;uch Objects &s;hould be received and entertained with, and will be by the Godly.

<P>There is one Exception, unto which what has been a&s;&s;erted in this Chapter, may by &s;ome be tho't liable, <HI>viz.</HI> That if what I here|in a&s;&s;ert were true, it would from thence follow, that our effectual Calling follows our Ju&s;tification, contrary to <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.30. where, ac|cording to the Apo&s;tle, it goeth before it. But I deny the Con&s;e|quence. It will follow, indeed, from what I maintain, that the effi|cacious Grace of God, by which the Work of Regeneration is wro't in our Souls, is not in order before our Ju&s;tification. If it were a Truth, that Man's effectual Calling does con&s;i&s;t in that Act of God's Power on their Souls, by which they are regenerated, or <HI>created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works,</HI> then indeed, it would follow, that our being effectually called would, according to me, follow our Ju&s;tifica|tion. But I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to grant, that our effectual Calling con&s;i&s;ts in that efficacious Grace which I have now mentioned. I take ef|fectual Calling to con&s;i&s;t in that Work of God, by his Word and Spirit, whereby Sinners are per&s;waded and enabled to comply with the Terms of the new Covenant; and to accept of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and all his Benefits, freely offered to them in the Go&s;pel; among which Benefits our Regeneration is one of the chief. Our Regeneration by the powerful Operation of God's holy Spirit, ought to be looked upon as an eminent Part of that Salvation, which, in our effectual Calling, we are per&s;waded and enabled to go to God in Chri&s;t for, and &s;o is, in order of Nature, before our going to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as we are re|quired; and before our Ju&s;tification al&s;o, as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.30. But this our Regeneration by the efficacious Grace of God, I take not to be &s;o.</P>
<P>But if (may &s;ome &s;ay) our Regeneration be not compri&s;ed in our effectual Calling, in the Text lately mentioned, where then &s;hall our Regeneration be found in that golden Chain, in which the Method of Man's Salvation is by the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;ed? What Link in that Chain may we under&s;tand to intend the glorious Work of our Regene|ration? Or is not this Work taken Notice of in it? To this I an|&s;wer, That it is by no Means to be allowed, that this was therein for|gotten, or omitted by the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle. Nor do I think with <HI>Barclay,</HI> a learned and noted <HI>Quaker,</HI> that this is intended by our being ju&s;tified. He ab&s;urdly takes our Ju&s;tification and Sanctification to be the &s;ame Thing: But I freely acknowledge that I do not at all
<PB N="85" REF="005439_0100_101831d5648f38f0">
doubt but that our Regeneration, and the progre&s;&s;ive Work of our Sanctification, are compri&s;ed in our being <HI>glorified.</HI> Nor is this an Opinion peculiar to me, as I can &s;hew if there be Occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>It is a great Truth in Divinity, That when God regenerateth any Per&s;on, he therein begins to glorify him; and in carrying on the Work of his Grace in regenerate Saints, he glorifieth them more and more. To this that well agreeth, 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>But we all with open Face, beholding as in a Gla&s;s the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> Every regenerate Soul hath eternal Life, <HI>i. e.</HI> he already hath it, and is <HI>pa&s;&s;ed from Death unto Life</HI>; and he hath it <HI>abiding in him,</HI> as in <HI>John</HI> 5.24. and 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.14, 15. Such have the very &s;ame Life in them which all glorified Saints &s;hall live in Heaven for ever: For, as Di|vines confe&s;s and maintain, Grace is Glory begun, and Glory is Grace made perfect. God has already given unto &s;uch the <HI>Earne&s;t of their Inheritance,</HI> which is the &s;ame in Kind with what they &s;hall hereafter receive in full. Herewith agreeth that, Eph. 1.11. <HI>In whom we have obtained an Inheritance, being prede&s;tinated according to the Purpo&s;e of him who worketh all Things after the Coun&s;el of his own Will.</HI> That al&s;o in Ver&s;e 13, 14. <HI>In whom ye al&s;o tru&s;ted after that ye heard the Word of Truth, the Go&s;pel of your Salvation: In whom al&s;o after ye believed, ye were &s;ealed with that holy Spirit of Promi&s;e, which is the Earne&s;t of our Inheritance, until the Redemption of the purcha&s;ed Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, unto the Prai&s;e of his Glory.</HI> God has already <HI>called &s;uch unto his eternal Glory,</HI> 1 Pet. 5.10. And the <HI>Spirit of God and of Glory re&s;teth on them,</HI> 1 Pet. 4.4.</P>
<P>I would here further ob&s;erve with Re&s;pect to our effectual Calling, that the good Effects thereby wrought on us, tho' not of the &s;ame Kind with tho&s;e wrought in our Regeneration, yet they are the &s;ame with that Faith and Repentance which, according to my Hypothe&s;is, is the Condition of the new Covenant. And I al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e, that Men's Per&s;everance in the Exerci&s;e of &s;uch Faith and Repentance, 'till they obtain the Benefits of Ju&s;tification and Regeneration, is com|pri&s;ed in their effectual Calling. None are effectually called without being per&s;uaded and enabled to hold out and go on to &s;eek the Lord 'till he hath Mercy on them, and grants his &s;aving Benefits to them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. The Offer of Salvation made to Sinners in the Go&s;pel, is an Offer of bringing them into a State of Salvation; and con&s;equently mu&s;t compri&s;e in it an Offer of regenera|ting Grace.</HEAD>
<P>_TO clear up this Argument I need only &s;ay a few Things very briefly.</P>
<P N="1">1. By a State of Salvation I under&s;tand &s;uch an E&s;tate as that &s;poken of by our Saviour, John 5.24. <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, He that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that &s;ent me, hath everla&s;ting Life, and &s;hall not come into Condemnation; but is pa&s;&s;ed from Death unto Life.</HI> Such an E&s;tate as this is al&s;o de&s;cribed by the A|po&s;tle, Rom. 8.1. <HI>There is therefore no Condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk not after the Fle&s;h, but after the Spirit.</HI> And Ver&s;e 35. and onwards, <HI>Who &s;hall &s;eparate us from the Love of Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. To put Men into &s;uch an E&s;tate as this, is wholly the Work of the ble&s;&s;ed God. It is, I &s;ay, the Work of God the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t. (<HI>Matth.</HI> 28.10. 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.7.) God only performs this Work, and he only can promi&s;e to perform it. Never did any Man put him&s;elf into &s;uch a State. Whatever may be required of Sinners in order hereunto, yet to put them into &s;uch a State is wholly God's Work: Men them&s;elves have no Hand in it. God only &s;aves all that are &s;aved, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 43.11. If Men are &s;aid to <HI>&s;ave them&s;elves,</HI> we mu&s;t only under&s;tand by it, their doing &s;omething required of them in order to God's &s;aving them.</P>
<P N="3">3. When God offers to &s;ave Sinners, he therein offers to bring, or put them, into &s;uch a State of Salvation as that but now de&s;cribed. When God offers to &s;ave Sinners, he therein offers to do all that for them, in which their Salvation con&s;i&s;ts, <HI>i. e.</HI> all that he actually does
<PB N="87" REF="005439_0102_101831d72e8d86b8">
for them when he &s;aves them. All this, I &s;ay, God offers to do for us, when he offers to &s;ave us; and to be &s;ure, out of this we mu&s;t not, we may not, leave his beginning to &s;ave us, and bringing us into a State of Salvation. It is impo&s;&s;ible for God to &s;ave Sinners, with|out doing this for them, <HI>i. e.</HI> without tran&s;lating them out of a State of Death, into a State of Life.</P>
<P N="4">4. God, in thus bringing Sinners into a State of Salvation, does work in them the great Work of Regeneration, <HI>gives them a new Heart, and a new Spirit, creates them anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, unto good Works.</HI> Therefore in offering to &s;ave them, he offers to do this for them, that is, he conditionally promi&s;eth that he will do it; which is the Point I am defending.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. There being an in&s;eparable Connexion betwixt all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, or everla&s;ting Mer|cies, whenever any of the&s;e are, by <HI>GOD,</HI> offered to Sinners, all the re&s;t are intended, and con&s;equently, the Grace of <HI>Regenera|tion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IF one Per&s;on makes an Offer to another of any good Thing, which has many other good Things in&s;epe|rably joined with or unto it, the Per&s;on to whom the Offer is made may well think, that he has an Offer of all tho&s;e good Things made to him, tho' they are not all enumerated in the Offer. No Man would, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, imagine that he had only that one good Thing offered to him, or &s;o many only as were expre&s;ly mentioned, but would ju&s;tly conclude that all tho&s;e other Goods which he was &s;ure were firmly bound up in the &s;ame Bundle with them, &s;o as never to be &s;eperated from them, were as really intended in the Offer, as tho&s;e expre&s;ly named. Thus, if God offers any of his &s;pe|cial &s;aving Mercies to &s;inful Men, he offers every one of them; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="88" REF="005439_0103_10183186083161b0">
he never gives any one of them to any Per&s;on unto whom he does not give them all.</P>
<P>That the &s;pecial Mercies or &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings which Je&s;us Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed for his People, are &s;o in&s;eparably joined together, both in the Nature of the Thing, and by the Appointment of God, as never to be &s;eparated one from another, is mo&s;t evident. God never did, nor never will be&s;tow any one of them on any Soul, on whom he does not, at the &s;ame Time, be&s;tow them all. All that enjoy any of them may &s;ay, as in Eph. 1.3. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath ble&s;&s;ed us with all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly</HI> Places (or Things) <HI>in Chri&s;t.</HI> They are all of them <HI>Things that ac|company Salvation,</HI> yea, e&s;&s;entially belong thereto, as in <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.9. Therefore to whom God gives any of them, he gives them all; and to whom he offers to give any one or more of them, he offers to give them all.</P>
<P>Sometimes God, in a Promi&s;e mentions one of them, &s;ometimes another, but he always intends every one of them; and &s;ometimes he makes U&s;e of Words which naturally compri&s;e every one of them; as when God offers Salvation to Sinners, <HI>Mark</HI> 16.15, 16. this Sal|vation compri&s;eth all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings in it: So when God offers to have Mercy on &s;inful Men, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 55.9. this Mercy compri&s;eth not only Pardon of Sin, there expre&s;ly mentioned, but all other &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, Grace and Glory and every good Thing needful, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 84.11.</P>
<P>That the Offer of Forgivene&s;s of Sins, or of Ju&s;tification, does in|clude in it an Offer of all other &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, is mo&s;t manife&s;t. In the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner, the meritorious Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is imputed or given to him: He therein <HI>receiveth the Gift of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Rom. 5.17. He receiveth Righteou&s;ne&s;s from the God of his Salvation, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 24.5. Now, whoever has an Intere&s;t in the perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, has therein and thereby an Intere&s;t in, or Right unto, all tho&s;e good Things which, by that Righteou&s;ne&s;s, he purcha&s;ed for Sinners: And never had any Sinner any one of the&s;e Benefits in any other Way, than by fir&s;t having an Intere&s;t in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, by whom they were all pur|cha&s;ed for tho&s;e that believe in him. Nor had ever any Sinner an Intere&s;t in this Righteou&s;ne&s;s in any other Way, than that of obtain|ing an Intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, in whom it is, and in and with whom it is be&s;towed, on all tho&s;e who, by Faith, receive him; and all &s;uch may &s;ay, as in I&s;ai. 45.24. <HI>In the Lord have I Righteou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="89" REF="005439_0104_101831dca38affc0">
and Strength,</HI> &amp;c. Yea, unto all &s;uch <HI>Chri&s;t is made Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification, and Redemption,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.30. Tho&s;e that have him have a Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and all Things obtained thereby with him. When God gives his own Son to them, <HI>he al&s;o with him freely gives them all Things,</HI> Rom. 8.32. He then gives them an Intere&s;t in his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and in all tho&s;e everla&s;ting Mercies purcha&s;ed thereby.</P>
<P>And as it is a Truth, that if God offers a ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;ne&s;s to Sinners, he, in &s;o doing, offers them all tho&s;e Benefits that were purcha&s;ed by that Righteou&s;ne&s;s; &s;o it is no le&s;s true, that if God offers unto Sinners any of the&s;e Benefits that were obtained by Chri&s;t's Sufferings and Obedience, he therein offers them an Intere&s;t in that Righteou&s;ne&s;s, by which the &s;ame were purcha&s;ed for tho&s;e that be|lieve in him. He offers not the&s;e without the Righteou&s;ne&s;s that pro|cured them; nor that Righteou&s;ne&s;s without the Benefits procured by it.</P>
<P>Thus it appeareth, That whenever God offereth any of his &s;pecial Mercies or &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings unto &s;inful Men, he offereth all of them: And it followeth from hence, that he mu&s;t needs offer the Grace of Regeneration together with the re&s;t; nor is this excepted as implied in the Condition on which the re&s;t are offered, as has been before &s;uffi|ciently manife&s;ted in Chap. V.</P>

Ver&s;e 4. <HI>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious Promi&s;es, that by the&s;e you might be Partakers of the divine Nature, having e&s;caped the Corruption that is in the World thro' Lu&s;t.</HI> De&s;igning to give In&s;tances of &s;everal con|ditional

Promi&s;es in &s;ome of the following Chapters; I intend in <HI>this,</HI> to endeavour to &s;hew, from the Te&s;timony now alledged, that we may expect to find &s;uch Promi&s;es in the Oracles of God, and have no Rea&s;on to think it &s;trange, if &s;everal &s;uch be named and in&s;i&s;ted on, for the Confirmation of the Hypothe&s;is which I am defending.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Thing I &s;hall ob&s;erve in the Te&s;timony read, is, that the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> mentioned therein are &s;aid to be <HI>exceeding great and precious.</HI> And &s;uch may Promi&s;es be &s;aid to be, in &s;everal Re&s;pects, as (1) In Re&s;pect of the Matter of them, or of the Nature of the Things en|gaged in them. If the Things promi&s;ed are great and precious, this puts a Value and Excellency upon the Promi&s;es wherein they are en|gaged. (2) The infallible Truth and Certainty of them is another Thing that greatly commends them, as precious and worthy to be prized, being &s;uch as may be &s;afely depended on.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> are &s;aid to be given by the &s;ame divine Power, by which, in Ver&s;e 3. <HI>all Things pertaining both to Life and Godline&s;s</HI> are al&s;o &s;aid to be given to us: For unto this, the Word <HI>whereby,</HI> in the Beginning of the fourth Ver&s;e, &s;eems evidently to refer. And this is &s;aid to be done by God and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, ju&s;t before in Ver&s;e &s;econd. By <HI>all Things pertaining to Life and Godline&s;s,</HI> in Ver&s;e third, I do not under&s;tand Life and Godli|ne&s;s it &s;elf, but all Things requi&s;ite to it, unto which the&s;e mentioned Promi&s;es belong; and &s;o the&s;e Words are like tho&s;e in I&s;ai. 5.4. <HI>What could I have done more to my Vineyard than I have done in it.</HI></P>
<P>I ob&s;erve <HI>thirdly,</HI> that the&s;e Pre-requi&s;ites to Life and Godline&s;s, are &s;aid to be given us <HI>through the Knowledge of him that hath called us to Glory and Vertue</HI>: And this <HI>Him</HI> is Je&s;us Chri&s;t, before mentioned; and it is by revealing and making him known that Sinners have <HI>all Things pertaining to Life and Godline&s;s</HI> afforded to them. Nor is there Occa&s;ion of under&s;tanding their being <HI>called to Glory and Virtue,</HI> of that which commonly under&s;tood by <HI>effectual Calling,</HI> i. e. &s;aving Conver&s;ion; for all that enjoy the Grace of the Go&s;pel, as in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.1. are <HI>called to Glory and Virtue.</HI> And by what follows in Ver&s;e 4, tho&s;e here &s;poken to, (at lea&s;t &s;ome of them) were not yet <HI>Par|takers of the divine Nature.</HI> And tho' this Epi&s;tle was in&s;cribed to &s;uch as had <HI>obtained like precious Faith</HI> with the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> and other true Saints, as appears in Ver&s;e 1. yet there is no Occa&s;ion to &s;uppo&s;e, that all that are &s;poken to in it, had obtained <HI>the Faith of God's Elect</HI>; becau&s;e that Kind of Faith which &s;ome of the Non-Elect
<PB N="91" REF="005439_0106_101831e1913f8318">
and Unregenerate are the Subjects of, may be al&s;o called <HI>exceed|ing precious,</HI> in Re&s;pect of the Object of it, the glorious Truth unto which it a&s;&s;enteth: And all that have received the Go&s;pel, by giving Credit to it, may be &s;aid <HI>to have obtained like precious Faith</HI> in Re&s;pect of its Object, with tho&s;e who have obtained Faith of a much better Kind, in Re&s;pect of the Rectitude of its Acts; of which la&s;t Kind, no doubt many of tho&s;e here &s;poken to by the Apo&s;tle, had al&s;o ob|tained.</P>
<P>That tho&s;e &s;poken to are &s;aid to have obtained the Faith mentioned <HI>thro' the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is a great Truth, whether the Faith intended be of one of the Kinds mentioned, or the other; for common Grace, as well as that which is &s;aving, is an Effect of the Merits of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s. But if his Faithfulne&s;s in fulfilling his Promi&s;es may be intended by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s here &s;poken of Ver&s;e 1. as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, this would &s;eem to favour the Hypothe&s;is for which I plead.</P>
<P>That the Apo&s;tle, in Ver&s;e 2d, wi&s;heth <HI>Peace from God the Father</HI> to tho&s;e unto whom he writeth, is far from nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;ing them to be already in a regenerate State.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve here <HI>fourthly,</HI> that the great <HI>End</HI> for which the&s;e precious Promi&s;es are &s;aid to be given to tho&s;e that have them, is, <HI>that by them they might be Partakers of the divine Nature.</HI> By which <HI>divine Na|ture,</HI> our Divines generally under&s;tand the &s;ame Thing which is by me called the Grace of Regeneration. And I may here well ob&s;erve, that this being the End for which the&s;e Promi&s;es are given to tho&s;e unto whom the Apo&s;tle here &s;peaks, it from hence evidently appears, that they are not by the Apo&s;tle all &s;uppo&s;ed to be in a regenerate State, notwith&s;tanding any Thing &s;aid in the fir&s;t Ver&s;e: That the Per&s;ons thus &s;poken to, &s;till need the Grace of Regeneration is plain, and &s;eems evidently &s;uppo&s;ed in the Expre&s;&s;ions: So that all the Que&s;|tion is, in what Sen&s;e Sinners that are &s;till unconverted may, by the mentioned precious Promi&s;es, be made Partakers of the divine Na|ture here &s;poken of?</P>
<P>I further ob&s;erve <HI>fifthly,</HI> that the Time when tho&s;e here &s;poken to may by the mentioned Promi&s;es be made Partakers of the divine Na|ture intended, is when they have <HI>e&s;caped the Corruption that is in the World thro' Lu&s;t</HI>: For thus the Words run, <HI>Having e&s;caped,</HI> &amp;c. Which e&s;caping the Corruption that is in the World, is not effected by Regeneration, but by a Work, in the Nature of it, preparatory to it; and of which Per&s;ons not &s;avingly converted may be the Subjects,
<PB N="92" REF="005439_0107_1018318c09c25250">
as evidently appears in Chap. 2. Ver&s;e 20, 21, 22. of the &s;ame Epi&s;tle; where &s;uch as had <HI>e&s;caped the Pollutions of the World, thro' the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> are yet mentioned as finally mi&s;carrying. Now I am not here di&s;cour&s;ing with &s;uch as hold, that true Saints may fall from Grace. In the Words there|fore under Con&s;ideration, it is plainly intimated, that God will not ordinarily, at lea&s;t, make Per&s;ons Partakers of the divine Nature 'till they have fir&s;t reformed their Lives, in &s;uch a Manner and Degree as Per&s;ons may before they are born again. And this is plainly inti|mated to us in other Texts of Scripture, as in <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.22, 23. and 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.9. as I &s;hall afterwards more fully &s;hew. Men have no Rea&s;on to expect, that God will pour out his Spirit upon them, to their &s;aving Conver&s;ion, that will not repent and reform their Lives, in &s;uch a Manner as by the Help of common Grace they may. This, I &s;ay, is nece&s;&s;ary in order to Men's being <HI>made Partakers of the di|vine Nature.</HI></P>
<P>Now I know of but two Ways in which it can, with any Shew of Truth, be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the precious Promi&s;es mentioned can &s;erve unto this End. One of the&s;e, is, that they are In&s;truments in the Hand of God for the working this great Change, call'd Regenera|tion; and &s;o of communicating unto Sinners the divine Nature &s;poken of. The other Sen&s;e is, that God makes Sinners Partakers of this gracious Principle, in Pur&s;uance of precious Promi&s;es, wherein he has conditionally engaged &s;o to do. The former of the&s;e Ways &s;ome take and I mi&s;like. The latter of them is that to which I adhere, and for which I plead. I &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e who are for the fir&s;t, may think there is Danger in admitting, that the divine Nature is given in Con&s;equence of any conditional Promi&s;es made of it. I think there is none. I will fir&s;t briefly &s;hew why I agree not with tho&s;e who expound the&s;e Words in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e Ways; and then &s;hew why I am for the <HI>latter.</HI></P>
<P>And in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, I will give &s;ome Rea&s;ons why I think the&s;e Promi&s;es are not here con&s;idered as the Means or In&s;truments by which the Grace of Regeneration is wrought in Men's Souls. And (1) I &s;uppo&s;e, that if the De&s;ign of the Holy Gho&s;t had here been to declare what the in&s;trumental Cau&s;es of Man's Conver&s;ion are, he would not have mentioned the Promi&s;es of God only, but would have a&s;cribed this to the Word of God in general, as he does in other Places, where it appears that this is his De&s;ign, as in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19.7, 8. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.14,&mdash;17. and <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.18. The Spirit of God in men|tioning
<PB N="93" REF="005439_0108_101831e31c6fada8">
Promi&s;es only, gives us great Rea&s;on to think, that what he a&s;cribes to them, is &s;omething proper to them, and not to the whole Word of God, which is in&s;trumental in Men's Conver&s;ion, but to the Promi&s;es only, as giving a Right to the Good &s;poken of in the Place under Con&s;ideration. (2) There is nothing either in the Text or Context, to oblige us to think, that that which I now argue again&s;t, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be intended in the Place; but on the contrary, that which I plead for &s;eems to be the mo&s;t natural and obvious Sen&s;e of the Words, as I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew, (3) That the In&s;trumentality of the Promi&s;es unto Men's Conver&s;ion, or to their being <HI>made Par|takers of the divine Nature,</HI> is not intended in the Words, I make evi|dent by this Rea&s;on: The Promi&s;es neither are, nor can be, in&s;tru|mental in the Sen&s;e here in Que&s;tion, in making any Per&s;ons <HI>Par|takers of the divine Nature.</HI> The Words mu&s;t not be under&s;tood in a Sen&s;e in which they neither are nor can be true.</P>
<P>But now, That no Man can by the Promi&s;es, be <HI>made a Partaker of the divine Nature,</HI> in the Sen&s;e I oppo&s;e, I thus make manife&s;t. Men's being <HI>made Partakers of the divine Nature,</HI> is the &s;ame Thing which, by <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> is otherwi&s;e called <HI>pa&s;&s;ive Conver&s;ion</HI>; or Conver|&s;ion taken in that Sen&s;e as Divines under&s;tand it, when they &s;ay the Soul is <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> in it; and affirm it to be wro't by an immediate Act of the holy Gho&s;t <HI>creating us anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us to good Works,</HI> as in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 50.10. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.10. and Chap. 1.19, 20. In Conver&s;ion thus taken, the Sinner does nothing, but God all, Jer. 31.18, 19. <HI>Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned&mdash;. After I was turned, I repented.</HI> In the Conver&s;ion of a Sinner, taken in this Sen&s;e, there is a Principle of Grace, or a divine Nature, put into the Soul, in the doing of which the Sinner him&s;elf has no Hand. He has <HI>a new Heart given to him, and a new Spirit put within him,</HI> by God. He does not this for him&s;elf, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26. nor is it po&s;&s;ible that any Promi&s;es can be the In&s;tru|ments of working &s;uch a Change in Men's Souls. The Change now under Con&s;ideration is not wro't by a <HI>moral In&s;trument,</HI> but by a <HI>phy|&s;ical Cau&s;e,</HI> or a <HI>&s;upernatural Power</HI>; not by <HI>moral Sua&s;ion,</HI> but by the <HI>mighty Power of God.</HI> When Mankind fir&s;t &s;inned again&s;t God, they lo&s;t all the Power they had to perform any Actions truly holy: Now when Sinners are <HI>made Partakers of the divine Nature,</HI> this Power is re&s;tored again in and unto them; which the Word read and preached is no Way competent to be an In&s;trument of; neither the Precepts, Promi&s;es, nor Threatnings of it can do this; nor can all of them to|gether work &s;uch a Change, any more than an Argument or Syllogi&s;m can remove a Mountain. All that the Word can do, it does in a
<PB N="94" REF="005439_0109_1018318de86ead70">
moral Way, by In&s;tructions, Convictions, and Per&s;ua&s;ions. It does not give any Power to the Soul that it had not before, but excites and &s;tirs Per&s;ons up to make a good Improvement of the Powers they have.</P>
<P>'Tho' that Text, Jam. 1.18. <HI>Of his own Will begat he us by the Word of Truth,</HI> &s;eems to look another Way; yet we mu&s;t know, that Regeneration, or the new Birth, may be taken more largely, as it compri&s;eth Men's active Conver&s;ion in it, or as intending their pa&s;&s;ive Conver&s;ion only. In the former Sen&s;e, Conver&s;ion is a&s;cribed to the Word of God read and preached; but in the latter Sen&s;e it is not, neither indeed can be. The Mini&s;try of the Word does ordi|narily accompany Conver&s;ion, but never works the Change: It does much in the Work preparatory to it, and in exciting to the Acts and Exerci&s;e of Grace, when once given; but it does nothing towards the infu&s;ing of the Principle. The preaching of the Word is not that by which we are created anew unto good Works: It is another Kind of Word that does this, even &s;uch a Kind of Power as that, Gen. 1.3. <HI>God &s;aid, Let there be Light, and there was Light,</HI> as appears by comparing that Place with 2 Cor. 4.6. <HI>God who hath commanded the Light to &s;hine out of Darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined into our Hearts, to give us the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> This God does by giving the divine Nature to us, as in the Text under Con&s;ideration. Thus I have &s;hewn why I think the divine Nature is not communicated by the Promi&s;es, as in&s;trumental efficient Cau&s;es of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew po&s;itively, why I conceive, that by the&s;e Promi&s;es we are <HI>made Partakers of the divine Nature,</HI> as it is pur|&s;uant to them, that God communicates the &s;ame unto us; or as it is by them we have a Right to it: And to confirm this, I &s;ay, (1) This &s;eems to be the mo&s;t natural and genuine Sen&s;e of the Expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed in the Text here in&s;i&s;ted on. When Per&s;ons are &s;aid to <HI>be made Partakers</HI> of any Mercy, by Promi&s;e, who would once imagine, that this meant, that the Promi&s;e intended was the efficient Cau&s;e in the Communication, or Conveyance of the Good &s;aid to be given by it? And not rather, that it was by Promi&s;e as that gave a Right to it. See Gal. 3.18. <HI>If the Inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of Pro|mi&s;e; but God gave it to</HI> Abraham <HI>by Promi&s;e.</HI> (2) Another Rea&s;on of this is, becau&s;e it is certain, that there are a great many &s;uch <HI>ex|ceeding great and precious Promi&s;es</HI> given, for the End here intended, <HI>viz.</HI> That, by Virtue of them, the Per&s;ons to whom they are given, <HI>might be Partakers of the divine Nature</HI>; the &s;ame being conditionally
<PB N="95" REF="005439_0110_101831e4ee2b03f8">
offered in them. If no &s;uch conditional Promi&s;es could be found in Scripture, as the&s;e I &s;peak of, it would not then be ea&s;y to declare what Promi&s;es are intended in the Place under Con&s;ideration, &s;uppo|&s;ing their In&s;trumentality to Conver&s;ion were what is therein de&s;igned. But if there are many conditional Promi&s;es of Regeneration found in Scripture, then we have good Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Way in which Sinners are by the&s;e <HI>made Partakers of the divine Nature,</HI> is by entitling them to it, on their Fulfilment of the Condition on which it is offered.</P>
<P>Now, That there are many &s;uch Promi&s;es, I will &s;hew in the Sequel of this Di&s;cour&s;e, by in&s;tancing in divers of them; and &s;o &s;hall here &s;uppo&s;e this to be a Truth.</P>
<P>But I &s;uppo&s;e it will by &s;ome be here &s;aid, That tho' it be denied, that there are any &s;uch conditional Promi&s;es as I plead for; yet ina&s;|much as there are ab&s;olute Promi&s;es of the Grace of Regeneration, (by &s;ome called the fir&s;t Grace) the&s;e may be the Promi&s;es intended in the Text in&s;i&s;ted on; and in Con&s;equence of which the Grace of a new Heart may be given, without Men's Performance of any Condition, by which they may be entitled to the Good of the&s;e Promi&s;es: And <HI>Ezek.</HI> 11.19, 20. and Chap. 36.26. are commonly in&s;tanced in, as containing &s;uch Promi&s;es. Unto this, &s;everal Things may be &s;aid, as,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It may be doubted whether the&s;e called <HI>ab&s;olute Promi&s;es,</HI> are indeed any Promi&s;es at all. Some learned Men &s;eem to think they are not; but rather Prophecies of the Mercies mentioned in them. I think Mr. BAXTER was of this Opinion. It &s;eems e&s;&s;ential to a Promi&s;e of good Things, that the Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, to whom it is made, be &s;ome Way or other de&s;cribed or indigitated in it. Now, the&s;e, here called Promi&s;es, do not this. No one Per&s;on can truly affirm, that the&s;e Promi&s;es are made to him. If they be Promi&s;es <HI>Judas</HI> might have laid as good a Claim to them as <HI>Peter.</HI> If God converts a Sinner, he does not therein fulfil any &s;uch Promi&s;e to him: If he does, then was he obliged by Promi&s;e to do it; which, how can any make manife&s;t. If God &s;hould not convert and &s;ave any Sinner in the World, none could &s;ay, that God has not kept his Word with him: Unle&s;s, with me, conditional Promi&s;es of converting Grace be ac|knowledged. If there be any Thing at all of the Nature of a Pro|mi&s;e, in &s;uch Declarations of God's Intention to convert and &s;ave &s;ome of the Children of Men, all Mankind have an equal Right to it, by Virtue of what is therein engaged, tho' God may, in his &s;ecret Pur|po&s;e, intend the Good promi&s;ed to certain definitive Per&s;ons, and not to any other.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="005439_0111_101831931f2cf8e8"><HI>Secondly,</HI> If the&s;e are allowed to be properly Promi&s;es; yet &s;ome think they are not Promi&s;es properly made to any of the &s;inful Chil|dren of Men, but to Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, in the Covenant of Re|demption, agreed on betwixt his Father and him; of which we have an Account in the holy Scriptures, <HI>P&s;al,</HI> 39.3. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 53.10, 11, 12. and el&s;ewhere. Of this Judgment was our very judicious and learned Mr. WILLARD, as appears in his Treati&s;e of that Cove|nant, Page 118. Thus the&s;e Promi&s;es are not made to Sinners at all, nor <HI>given to us,</HI> as in the Text under Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> If the&s;e be allowed to be Promi&s;es, and to be made to the &s;inful Children of Men, I de&s;ire to know how it appears, that there is no Condition required of them in order to their being Partakers of the Good promi&s;ed.&mdash;The Contrary &s;eems plainly to appear, with Re&s;pect to that in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26. For tho' a Condition be not ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame Ver&s;e or Sentence; yet there &s;eems to be one plainly required, a little after, in Ver&s;e 37. <HI>Yet for this will I be en|quired of by the Hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>to do it for them.</HI> By which Words, I think, all other Promi&s;es of the like Nature may be explained. God does, therein, as good as tell tho&s;e, unto whom &s;uch Promi&s;es are made, that they may not expect this Mercy without &s;eeking to him for it; and doubtle&s;s tho&s;e that expect it in any other Way will find them&s;elves mi&s;taken. What tho' God does not always expre&s;s the Condition of a Promi&s;e, in every Place where the Promi&s;e it &s;elf, and the Good promi&s;ed, is expre&s;&s;ed; yet if, in other Places, the Condition be expre&s;&s;ed, as well as the Good he promi&s;eth, this is &s;ufficient to let us know, that the Promi&s;e is every where to be under|&s;tood as made on that Condition; at lea&s;t, that Men may not expect the Good of &s;uch Promi&s;es, without the Performance of the Condition required in order to it. And I &s;hall &s;till have Occa&s;ion to &s;hew, that there are many Places of Scripture where Promi&s;es of the &s;ame Mercy are conditionally propo&s;ed to Sinners.</P>
<P>And &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould find, in the Bible, &s;everal Places where Pardon of Sin is promi&s;ed, without expre&s;ly naming the Condition on which that Promi&s;e is made, might I from thence infer, that it is a Benefit that is not conditionally offered? If this would do, we may find &s;uch Places, as in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 43.22. <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.34. and Chap. 33.8. &s;o in <HI>Micah</HI> 7.18. May we infer from hence, that Pardon of Sin is not conditionally offered? Surely I think not.</P>

<P>_I SHALL, for the clearing up of what is here a&s;&s;ert|ed, endeavour to &s;hew, (1) That there are in Scrip|ture conditional Promi&s;es made, that &s;uch as &s;eek <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>&s;pecial Favour,</HI> &s;hall find <HI>him</HI> and <HI>that.</HI> (2) That the&s;e Promi&s;es contain and imply in them, an Offer of the Grace of Regeneration.</P>
<P>To make good the fir&s;t of the&s;e, I &s;hall (1) in&s;tance in &s;everal &s;uch Promi&s;es as I here intend. (2) Make &s;ome Ob&s;ervations on them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Promi&s;es I here intend are &s;uch as the&s;e which follow, 1 Chron. 28.9. &mdash;<HI>If thou &s;eek him, he will be found of thee.</HI> 2 Chron. 15.2. &mdash;<HI>The Lord is with you while ye be with him; if ye &s;eek him, he will be found of you; if ye for&s;ake him, he will for&s;ake you.</HI> Prov. 8.17. <HI>Tho&s;e that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me.</HI> Jer. 29.13. <HI>Ye &s;hall &s;eek me, and find me, when ye &s;hall &s;earch for me with all your Heart.</HI> Amos 5.4. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord unto the Hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>Seek ye me, and ye &s;hall live.</HI> Matth. 7.7,&mdash;11. <HI>A&s;k, and it &s;hall be given to you: Seek, and ye &s;hall find: Knock, and it &s;hall be opened unto you. For every one that a&s;keth, receiveth: And he that &s;eeketh, findeth: And to him that knocketh, it &s;hall be opened. Or what Man is there of you, whom, if his Son a&s;k Bread, will give him a Stone? Or if he ask a Fi&s;h, will give him a Serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good Gifts to your Children, how much more will your Father which is in Heaven, give good Things to them that ask him.</HI> We have the &s;ame Words, in effect, <HI>Luke</HI> 11.9,&mdash;13. With the&s;e Texts agreeth I&s;ai. 45.19.

<HI>I &s;aid not unto the Hou&s;e of</HI> Jacob, <HI>Seek ye me in vain.</HI> Al&s;o I&s;ai. 55.6. <HI>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found&mdash;.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;hall make &s;ome Ob&s;ervations on the Promi&s;es. And here, I &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">(1) Tho' the Words, in &s;ome of the Places mentioned, are not expre&s;s'd in the Form of Promi&s;es; yet Promi&s;es are plainly &s;uppo&s;ed or implied in them; as in that <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 45.19. and 55.6.</P>
<P N="2">(2) The&s;e Promi&s;es are <HI>conditional.</HI> A Condition is plainly expre&s;t in mo&s;t of them, and implied in them all: And the Condition required is, <HI>&s;eeking God</HI>: And is otherwi&s;e called, <HI>a&s;king, knocking,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">(3) Such conditional Promi&s;es are made to unregenerate Per&s;ons, to encourage them to &s;eek the Lord for his &s;pecial Mercies or &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings. I do not &s;ay, they are not made to the Regenerate al&s;o, to encourage them to &s;eek for more Grace; but I think the fir&s;t and principal De&s;ign of them, is, to encourage &s;uch as are in a State of Sin and Death, to &s;eek to God for his &s;aving Mercies; &s;uch as Pardon of Sin, a new Heart, and a new Spirit. This is, at lea&s;t, one De&s;ign of them.</P>
<P N="4">(4) Tho&s;e Promi&s;es quoted out of the old Te&s;tament, as well as tho&s;e out of the New, are Promi&s;es of &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings or everla&s;ting Mercies, and ought not to be under&s;tood of temporal Ble&s;&s;ings only, &s;ee <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 103.17, 18.</P>
<P N="5">(5) When unregenerate Per&s;ons are called upon and encouraged to &s;eek God, with a Promi&s;e that they &s;hall find him, and obtain Mercy from him, the &s;eeking intended does not compri&s;e the exerci&s;ing of true Grace and Holine&s;s in it: It is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould do this: Be|cau&s;e this is that, which they being without, are encouraged to &s;eek after. God does not &s;ay unto an unregenerate Soul,
<Q>Seek to me for the Grace of Regeneration, in the Exerci&s;e of that &s;ame Grace, and then I will be&s;tow it upon thee.</Q>
It is a Di&s;honour to God &s;o to expound &s;uch Promi&s;es. Therefore tho' it be true, as in the la&s;t foregoing Particular, that it is not any Kind of &s;eeking that will an|&s;wer this End, but a &s;eeking after a due and &s;uitable Manner, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;eeking with Faith, in Hope, under an humble Sen&s;e of Unworthine&s;s, with great Earne&s;tne&s;s and Per&s;everance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet this Grace to be exerci&s;ed in &s;eeking the Grace of a new Heart and a new Spirit, can|not be &s;uch Faith, Hope and Humility, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as is peculiar to &s;uch as are already born of God, and become new Creatures; but &s;uch as may be called <HI>common Grace</HI>; ina&s;much as &s;uch may have it, as are not yet <HI>pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life</HI>; or as have not <HI>eternal Life abiding in them,</HI> as in <HI>John</HI> 5.24. compared with 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.14, 15. This

&s;eems to be &s;o evident, that I wonder that all Men do not yield to it, as I know of &s;ome that do.</P>
<P>Having now con&s;idered the Nature of the Promi&s;es alledged in this Chapter, for the Confirmation of my Hypothe&s;is, I &s;hall proceed to &s;hew, <HI>Secondly,</HI> That an Offer of the Grace of Regeneration is im|plied in them. I have proved that they contain and compri&s;e condi|tional Promi&s;es of our finding God, and obtaining his &s;pecial Favour; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am extremely mi&s;taken, if this does not include and imply in it our obtaining the regenerating and &s;aving Influences of his holy Spirit. Does not our obtaining Mercy at God's Hands, as well imply in it his changing our Hearts, and endowing us with his holy Spirit, or making us Partakers of the divine Nature, as his par|doning our Sins, and ju&s;tifying of us? Finding God, &s;urely &s;ignifies, finding Favour in his Sight; and this certainly implies in it, our re|ceiving from him all tho&s;e &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings which he be&s;tows on all tho&s;e to whom he extends his &s;pecial Favour.</P>

<DIV3 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X. That tho&s;e conditional Promi&s;es of the Holy Spirit, which we have in the Oracles of God, include and imply in them Offers of converting Grace.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Promi&s;es which I here intend are &s;uch as the&s;e following. Prov. 1.23. <HI>Turn you at my Re|proof: Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my Words unto you.</HI> Luke 11.13. <HI>If ye, being evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Children, how much more &s;hall your heavenly Father give his Holy Spirit to them that ask him.</HI> Acts 2.38. <HI>Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, and ye &s;hall receive the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>That the&s;e are Promi&s;es, and that they are conditional, &s;eems too evident to be denied. A Precept with a Promi&s;e annexed to en|courage
<PB N="100" REF="005439_0115_1018319b14e194c0">
the Performance of the Duty required, mu&s;t, I think, be looked upon as a conditional Promi&s;e. Such are the&s;e in each of the Places mentioned, as by the bare reading of them appears.</P>
<P>That the&s;e Promi&s;es are made to unregenerate Per&s;ons cannot, I think, be rea&s;onably denied. That in <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.23. is made to &s;uch Per&s;ons as are de&s;cribed in Ver&s;e 22. who are there thus called on, <HI>How long, ye &s;imple Ones, will ye love Simplicity? And the Scorners de|light in &s;corning.</HI> And it follows in Ver&s;e 23. <HI>Turn ye,</HI> &amp;c. In <HI>Luke</HI> 11.13. the Per&s;ons &s;poken to are directed how they may obtain the Gift of God's Spirit, which &s;uppo&s;eth that they are, or may be, without it; and tho&s;e who are &s;o, may, I think, well take the Words as &s;poken to them, or concerning them. The Words in <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38. were &s;poken to very heinous Sinners, who were then clo&s;ely dealt with, for having a Hand in the crucifying the Lord Je|&s;us, and who being <HI>pricked in the Heart,</HI> under a deep Sen&s;e of their Sin and Guilt, a&s;ked that Que&s;tion in Ver&s;e 37. <HI>What &s;hall we do?</HI> And the An&s;wer given them did not import that they were in a State of Grace, but the contrary. They were, many of them at lea&s;t, in an unconverted State.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things being briefly ob&s;erved, I &s;hall more di&s;tinctly con|&s;ider two Things, <HI>viz.</HI> (1) What the Benefit is, here conditionally promi&s;ed to the&s;e. (2) On what Condition it is promi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us con&s;ider what the Benefit is which, in the Places under Con&s;ideration, is conditionally promi&s;ed to &s;uch Sinners as the&s;e: And, that we may judge aright of this, we &s;hall con&s;ider how the &s;ame is de&s;cribed in each of the mentioned Places.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with that in <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.23. And here the Good pro|mi&s;ed is thus de&s;cribed; <HI>I will pour out my Spirit unto you.</HI> Whether by God's Spirit here, we are to under&s;tand the Per&s;on of the Holy Gho&s;t, or tho&s;e Gifts and Graces of which he is the Author and Be|&s;tower, need not be earne&s;tly di&s;puted. If the <HI>former,</HI> then the Spirit is here &s;poken of as poured on Men to work his &s;aving Graces in them, which is as much as I de&s;ire. If the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> that is what I plead for in this E&s;&s;ay. If <HI>both,</HI> this &s;till comes fully up to my Purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Grace of Regeneration is conditionally offered or pro|mi&s;ed to Sinners in the Covenant of Grace.</P>
<P>In which of the&s;e Ways &s;oever this Promi&s;e is under&s;tood, &s;aving Illumination and In&s;truction is certainly intended in the Promi&s;e
<PB N="101" REF="005439_0116_101831f14453a2b0">
made, when God tells tho&s;e that he &s;peaks to, that he will make known his Words to them. This will be evident by comparing the&s;e Words with others like them: Such as we may find in <HI>Prov.</HI> 2.5. and <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.18, 19. <HI>John</HI> 17.6, 7, 8. The pouring out of God's Spirit to &s;inful Men, certainly intends &s;aving Illumination and Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>In that Place, <HI>Luke</HI> 11.13. the Thing promi&s;ed, is <HI>the Gift of the Holy Spirit</HI> to tho&s;e that perform the Condition to that End required of them. Now by this Holy Spirit we mu&s;t under&s;tand, either the Per&s;on of the Holy Gho&s;t, whom God &s;ends into the Hearts of his cho&s;en Ones, to regenerate, &s;anctify and influence them, and dwell in them, as his Temple for ever, of which the Scriptures &s;peak plen|tifully; or that Principle of &s;aving Grace and Holine&s;s, which he works in, or be&s;tows upon, &s;inful Men in their Regeneration; which is al&s;o called by the Name of the <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> Gal. 5.17. and <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26. and el&s;ewhere: Either of the&s;e will &s;erve my Turn.</P>
<P>In <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38. the Good conditionally promi&s;ed to the Sinners there &s;poken to, is the <HI>Remi&s;&s;ion of Sin,</HI> and <HI>the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t</HI>: In the la&s;t of which the Grace of Regeneration is certainly implied, as well as in the other Promi&s;es which I have already &s;poken to. The&s;e are Things which God has, in the Promi&s;e, joined toge|ther; and no Man ought to go about to &s;eparate them. What is intended by Salvation, <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. and in this Chap. Ver&s;e 22. is here called <HI>Remi&s;&s;ion of Sin,</HI> is the &s;ame with that Believing, which is required in the but now mentioned Text in <HI>Mark.</HI> As for that extraordinary Effu&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;poken of in the former Part of this Chapter, there are many who repent and are baptized, who yet never obtain it. But the Spirit in its &s;aving Operations, all who repent, and obtain Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins do receive. And the&s;e Benefits true Penitents are made Partakers of in the order in which they are here mentioned, as I have already abundantly proved; <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Pardon of Sin, and <HI>then</HI> the Grace of Regeneration immediately thereon.</P>
<P N="2">2. We mu&s;t con&s;ider what the Condition is on which this Bene|fit is, or rather the&s;e Benefits are offered.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">(1) In Prov. 1.23. the Duty or Condition required is <HI>Turning at God's Reproof,</HI> by which we may not under&s;tand &s;uch a Turning from Sin unto God as does pre-&s;uppo&s;e the Gift of the Holy Spirit, in his
<PB N="102" REF="005439_0117_1018319fae4058e8">
regenerating Influences; for the Gift of the Holy Spirit, under&s;tood in this Sen&s;e, evidently followeth the Turning here intended, as ap|pears in the Text; &s;o that the Turning here required, is an Act on which the mentioned Benefit is promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t know, therefore, that there is a <HI>Turning at God's Re|proof,</HI> which is preparatory to Regeneration, and, in Order of Na|ture, before God's <HI>pouring out his Spirit unto us, and making known his Words unto us,</HI> in that &s;pecial Sen&s;e, in which the&s;e Words are here u&s;ed; and unto which the Influences of the Holy Spirit, with which &s;ome Sinners are favoured before they are &s;avingly converted, are &s;ufficient. It is evident in Scripture, that Sinners enjoying the Mini&s;try of God's Word, (here, as I think, called his Reproofs) accompanied with the Strivings of his Spirit, may have a Work of Conver&s;ion wrought in them, of a lower Kind than that which we call by the Name of <HI>Regeneration</HI>; and yet &s;uch as to denominate them Believers, Penitents, Saints and Righteous; in&s;omuch that &s;ome who were never regenerated by the Spirit of God, are in Scripture &s;aid to have <HI>e&s;caped the Pollutions of the World, thro' the Knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> If what I have here &s;aid be called in Que&s;tion, as I think it will not, I hope I &s;hall be able, if I live, to make it good: At pre&s;ent I &s;hall content my &s;elf to refer my Rea|der to &s;ome of the Texts by which this Truth is &s;ufficiently confirm|ed: Such as <HI>Matth.</HI> 13.20, 21. <HI>Luke</HI> 8.13. <HI>Matth.</HI> 12.41. and Chap. 11.21. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.24, 26. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.20, 21. I may add, that Sinners not yet &s;avingly converted may be &s;o far turned as to cry earne&s;tly to God for converting Grace, as in <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.18. and <HI>Prov.</HI> 2.3, 4.</P>
<P>Thus much being &s;aid, it is ea&s;y to conceive how Per&s;ons not yet endowed with the Holy Spirit, in the Sen&s;e that the Regenerate are, may yet be &s;uch as a&s;k him, or pray to God to be&s;tow him on them, as in <HI>Luke</HI> 11.13. The Condition there required in order to Per&s;on's having God's Spirit poured out to them.</P>
<P>In the other Text mentioned, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38. the Condition required, is, <HI>repenting</HI> and being <HI>baptized in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> By the former of the&s;e we mu&s;t under&s;tand &s;uch a Kind of Repentance as I have already de&s;cribed in the la&s;t Paragraph, <HI>viz.</HI> a Kind of Repen|tance going before, and being, in the Nature of it, preparatory to Regeneration; becau&s;e, according to the Text, Men's having Re|mi&s;&s;ion of Sin and the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, follows after it. In|deed when Sinners, being pricked in their Hearts, cry out, <HI>What
<PB N="103" REF="005439_0118_101831f2d3f3ae68">
&s;hall we do,</HI> as in Ver&s;e 37. and, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved,</HI> as in <HI>Acts</HI> 16.30. their Enquiry is not only after Pardon, but after a new Heart and a new Spirit al&s;o. Such are therefore fitly here told how they may obtain the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, as well as the Pardon of their Sins. Note, that by Repentance, here, the &s;ame Thing is in|tended as is meant by Believing, <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16.</P>
<P>What is implied in Men's being <HI>baptized in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>; and how this is required as a Condition of their receiving the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, mu&s;t be here briefly con&s;idered; for it &s;eems plainly to be &s;o required in the Words under Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I then conceive that Bapti&s;m here, is not to be con&s;idered as a mere Wa&s;hing with Water, in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, nor indeed ever &s;hould be &s;o, but as a Seal and Token of the new Covenant, as Circumci&s;ion, according to the Nature of the In&s;titution, al&s;o was, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17, 11. <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.11. So that to be circumci&s;ed of old was, and to be baptized now is, the &s;ame Thing in other Words, as to be taken vi&s;ibly into Covenant with God. Re&s;pecting Circum|ci&s;ion it is plain that he that was circumci&s;ed was thereby bound and obliged to the Ob&s;ervance of the whole Law, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.3. Where by the Law, I do not under&s;tand the Covenant of Works, but the Covenant of Grace, according to that Di&s;pen&s;ation of it which, un|der the old Te&s;tament, was to be ob&s;erved; for according to that Law the <HI>Jews</HI> were governed, and not according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Works; if they had, they could not have been &s;aved. It is al&s;o evident, that he that is baptized in, or into, the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t, is thereby bro't under an Obligation to perform all the Duties required in the Go&s;pel, or under the new Te&s;tament. And, by the Way, Infants are as capable of being brought under &s;uch covenant Obligations now under the Go&s;pel, as they were under the Law. And as for the Adult, when they are baptized, they are bound by their own Act and Deed, to perform all the Duties required in the new Te&s;tament. And hence it &s;eemeth to follow, that to be baptized in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or in the Name of all the Per&s;ons in the Holy Trinity, is the &s;ame Thing as to be initiated into the new covenant State, and laid under a foederal Obligation to perform all the Duties of it.</P>
<P>Now this being duly con&s;idered, we may the more ea&s;ily under|&s;tand why, and in what Sen&s;e Bapti&s;m is required, as a Condition of the new Covenant, or our Willingne&s;s to take upon us an Obligation to the Duties of it, or to take the Yoke of Je&s;us Chri&s;t upon us:
<PB N="104" REF="005439_0119_101831a2ae33be58">
And he that refu&s;eth to be baptized, does in Effect therein &s;ay, That he <HI>will not have the Man,</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>to reign over him,</HI> as in Luke 19.14. Such therefore, as refu&s;e to be baptized, are &s;aid to <HI>re&s;i&s;t the Coun&s;el of God again&s;t them&s;elves,</HI> Luke 7.30. 'Tis therefore no Wonder, that this is required as ordinarily nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, as in <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. and as nece&s;&s;ary to our obtaining Remi&s;&s;ion of Sin, and the Gift of the holy Gho&s;t, here in <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38.</P>
<P>Here, by the Way, I cannot forbear ob&s;erving, how greatly they are mi&s;taken, who think that Bapti&s;m is, according to Chri&s;t's In&s;ti|tution, to follow after Regeneration and the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, when in truth it is to be received or &s;ubmitted to, in order to our obtaining the&s;e Mercies, as in the Text I am con&s;idering. Tho' the &s;ame Kind of Faith and Repentance be nece&s;&s;ary in order to it, as I have &s;hewed; yet not that which is peculiar to the Regenerate.</P>

<DIV3 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI. That the Offers made to Sinners, of the Wa|ter of Life, in the Go&s;pel, are Offers of the &s;aving Graces of the holy Spirit.</HEAD>
<P>_THAT there are in the holy Scriptures mo&s;t graci|ous Offers of the Water of Life, is very certain. Such an Offer is that in I&s;ai. 55.1. <HI>Ho! every one that thir&s;teth, come ye to the Waters.</HI>&mdash; Such al&s;o is that in John 7.37. <HI>Je&s;us &s;tood and cried, &s;aying, If any Man thir&s;t, let him come to me and drink.</HI> Such an Offer there al&s;o is in Rev. 22.17. <HI>The Spirit and the Bride &s;ay, Come. And let him that is athir&s;t come: And who&s;o|ever will, let him take the Water of Life freely.</HI> Such an Offer is al&s;o implied in John 4.10. <HI>Je&s;us &s;aid unto her, If thou knewe&s;t the Gift of God, and who it is that &s;aith to thee, Give me to drink; thou woulde&s;t have a&s;ked him, and he would have given thee living Water.</HI></P>
<P>Now, all that is here nece&s;&s;ary to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, is to &s;hew, that an Offer of the <HI>Water of Life,</HI> or of this <HI>living Water,</HI> does cer|tainly contain or imply in it, an Offer of the Grace of Regeneration. And to make this evident, I &s;hall (1) endeavour to prove, that the
<PB N="105" REF="005439_0120_101831f4f13b4198">
Grace of Regeneration, or a Principle of &s;aving Grace and Holine&s;s, is the very Thing intended by the Water of Life, in Scripture: But if that may not be admitted, then (2) it mu&s;t be implied and com|prehended in that which otherwi&s;e is intended by it.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I will endeavour to &s;hew, that by the <HI>Water of Life,</HI> the Grace of Regeneration is in Scripture intended: And this I will en|deavour to make evident, by comparing &s;ome of the Places of Scrip|ture that &s;peak of it. In <HI>John</HI> 4.10. our Lord having &s;poken of this Water, in &s;uch Language as plainly implieth an Offer of it, and his Readine&s;s to give it to &s;uch as a&s;k it of him, he after &s;ome further Di&s;cour&s;e with the Woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> gives her this further Ac|count of the Advantages which &s;uch have by it, as receive it of him. Ver&s;e 14. <HI>Who&s;oever drinketh of the Water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall never thir&s;t: But the Water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall be in him a Well of Water &s;pringing up to everla&s;ting Life.</HI> In which Words of our Lord he plainly intimates, that this Water is &s;omething, which the Per&s;ons partaking of it, have within them, as a living Principle of Life and Motion; by which Principle of Life, what can we &s;o well under|&s;tand as that divine Nature given to Men in their Regeneration? Of which we read <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.14. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.2. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.4. Or, if not this, the Spirit him&s;elf, who is the Author, Be&s;tower and Pre|&s;erver of this divine Principle? Which of the&s;e is to me equal, and comes to the &s;ame Thing.</P>
<P>Again, our Saviour, in <HI>John</HI> 7.37. having invited thir&s;ty Sinners to come to him, and drink, (of the Water of Life, no doubt) he adds in Ver&s;e 38. <HI>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath &s;aid, out of his Belly &s;hall flow Rivers of living Water</HI>: By which Water, that we might under&s;tand what he intended, the Evangeli&s;t immediately &s;ub|joins the&s;e Words, in Ver&s;e 39. <HI>This he &s;pake of the Spirit, which they that believe on him &s;hould receive.</HI> Now, what can this po&s;&s;ibly intend, if by it be not meant either the Per&s;on of the Holy Spirit, or that divine Principle which he is the Author of, in Men's Souls, as before.</P>
<P>The Belly, out of which the&s;e Waters are &s;aid to flow, may be under&s;tood to mean the inward Parts, or Heart, as by comparing <HI>Job</HI> 15.35. with <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.6. does appear: And what we may un|der&s;tand by this Waters flowing from thence, we may gather from Luke 6.45. <HI>A good Man out of the good Trea&s;ure of his Heart, bring|eth forth that which is good</HI>; with which agreeth that in P&s;al. 40.8. <HI>I delight to do thy Will, O God: Yea, thy Law is within my Heart.</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="005439_0121_101831a5050d6178">
The Scriptures of the old Te&s;tament, to which the&s;e Words of our Saviour, may, I think, be &s;uppo&s;ed to refer, may be &s;uch as we have in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 44.3, 4, 5. and Chap. 49.10. and 58.11. the la&s;t of which Texts I &s;hall only here tran&s;cribe, as agreeing well with this Place and that before mentioned, John 4.14. <HI>The Lord &s;hall guide thee continually, and &s;atisfy thy Soul in Drought, and make fat thy Bones: And thou &s;halt be like a watered Garden, and like a Spring of Water, who&s;e Waters fail not.</HI></P>
<P>There is one Exception to which, what I here plead for, may &s;eem liable, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Evangeli&s;t &s;ays, that our Lord here &s;pake of the Spirit, which they that believe on him &s;hould receive&punc; For the Holy Gho&s;t was not yet given, becau&s;e Je&s;us was not yet glori|fied: By which it &s;eems as if our Lord here intended tho&s;e extraor|dinary Gifts of the Holy Spirit given at <HI>Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">co&s;t,</HI> after his A&s;cen&s;ion, <HI>Acts</HI> 2. beginning, according to that Prophecy in <HI>Joel</HI> 2.28, 29.</P>
<P>Now to this I an&s;wer, That tho' there be no Doubt but that our Lord had a Re&s;pect to the mentioned extraordinary Gifts; yet to re&s;train his Meaning to the&s;e only, without taking into what he in|tended, the giving of the Holy Gho&s;t, for the Conver&s;ion of great Numbers of Souls about that Time, is, I think, altogether without Warrant. I know of no Expo&s;itors that &s;o re&s;train the Sen&s;e of that Prophecy in <HI>Joel,</HI> to tho&s;e extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit men|tioned, or to any other in the Days of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, or at any other Time afterwards, as not to include tho&s;e that are common to all Believers: And our Saviour warrants our expounding it in this Manner, by &s;peaking of his giving the Spirit, as the Privilege of Believers in general, without any Exception, in the Place di&s;cour&s;ed on, and el&s;ewhere, as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.9. and <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38, 39.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that none can believe in Chri&s;t, 'till the Spirit of God in his &s;aving Influences be given to them; And therefore, the Grace given in Men's fir&s;t Conver&s;ion cannot be given to them by Promi&s;e; I &s;hall, be&s;ides what has been already &s;aid to this, hereafter take this Objection under Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>If what I have now &s;aid be not thought &s;ufficient to prove the Water of Life offered to Sinners, to be the &s;ame Thing with the Holy Spirit given in Regeneration, as I think it is, then I here fur|ther &s;ay,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That &s;uppo&s;ing Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, as &s;ome think, be intended by that admirable Water, the Gift of this Water will &s;up|po&s;e and imply, the Gift of the Grace of Regeneration; and &s;o an
<PB N="107" REF="005439_0122_101831f9d1ab6060">
Offer of Je&s;us Chri&s;t will imply an Offer of that. As Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;ometimes called <HI>the Bread of Life</HI>; &s;o if it be allowed that he is here called the Water of Life al&s;o, an Offer of the Grace of Regenera|tion will be &s;till implied in an Offer of Him. Tho&s;e who come unto him are &s;aid to come as to a <HI>living Fountain,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.4. And he may be under&s;tood to be intended by that <HI>Fountain opened,</HI> Zach. 13.1. If it then be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf is the Water of Life here intended, the offering of this Water to Sinners, is an offer|ing of him to them. But then Je&s;us Chri&s;t thus offered unto &s;inful Men, is offered with all his Fulne&s;s to them, even all that Fulne&s;s of which we read <HI>Col.</HI> 1.18, 19. and <HI>John</HI> 1.14, 16. and if &s;o, then to be &s;ure not without his Spirit and Grace in and with him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Part II.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Tho&s;e conditional Offers of &s;piritual Wi&s;dom made to Sinners in the Word of God, are Offers of a Principle of &s;aving Grace or Holine&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>_IN Pur&s;uance of what I de&s;ign in this Chapter, I mu&s;t &s;hew, that there are &s;uch Promi&s;es as I here &s;peak of; and then prove, that the&s;e Promi&s;es con|tain or imply in them a conditional Offer of a Principle of &s;aving Grace or Holine&s;s. And I &s;hall endeavour to make this good in both the Parts of it, with Re&s;pect to two Promi&s;es, or rather one and the &s;ame, expre&s;&s;ed in two Texts of Scripture; one of which we have in the <HI>old Te&s;tament,</HI> the other in the <HI>new.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with that in the old Te&s;tament, which we have in <HI>Prov.</HI> 2. beginning. That we may at once &s;ee it with the Condition on which it is made, with a Rea&s;on given for the certain Fulfilment of it, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe the Words from the fir&s;t to the &s;ixth Ver&s;e,
<PB N="108" REF="005439_0123_101831aa0ca64be8">
<HI>My Son, if thou wilt receive my Words, and hide my Commandments with thee; &s;o that thou incline thine Ear unto Wi&s;dom, and apply thine Heart to Under&s;tanding: Yea, if thou crie&s;t after Knowledge, and lifte&s;t up thy Voice for Under&s;tanding: If thou &s;eeke&s;t her as Silver, and &s;earche&s;t for her, as for hid Trea&s;ures: Then &s;halt thou under&s;tand the Fear of the Lord; and find the Knowledge of God. For the Lord giveth Wi&s;dom: Out of his Mouth cometh Knowledge and Under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be denied that the&s;e Words run in the Form of a con|ditional Promi&s;e: My Son, if thou wilt do thus and thus, then &s;halt thou, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And in order to our rightly under&s;tanding the Text, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, (1) to whom this Promi&s;e is made, (2) on what Conditions, (3) what is the Good promi&s;ed, (4) the Rea&s;on given for the Confirmation of the Truth of the Promi&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us con&s;ider to whom this Promi&s;e is made. And here I &s;hall only in&s;i&s;t on one Thing, <HI>viz.</HI> That this Promi&s;e is undoubtedly made to Per&s;ons in an unregenerate State, as well as unto &s;uch as are regenerate or born again. It is evident that it is the Scope and De|&s;ign of the Place, to direct Per&s;ons how they may get true Wi&s;dom, that which is of the be&s;t Kind: And indeed this is the Scope of the whole Book of <HI>Proverbs,</HI> as appears Chap. 1. Ver&s;e 2,&mdash;7. Now, to imagine, that &s;uch Directions are, by the wi&s;e Man, and by God him&s;elf &s;peaking by him, given only to tho&s;e who are already truly and &s;piritually wi&s;e, is what there is not the lea&s;t Colour for. I deny not that the truly wi&s;e are here directed how they may get more Wi&s;dom of the &s;ame Kind; but I affirm, that this cannot be the only, or indeed the principal, Intendment of the Place: But &s;uch as are &s;till de&s;titute of the Wi&s;dom intended, are here directed how they may obtain it; and are encouraged to &s;eek after it. Nor is that Compellation, <HI>My Son,</HI> any Way incon&s;i&s;tent with what I here &s;ay, if we con&s;ider how it is frequently u&s;ed in this Book, and el&s;ewhere in Scripture.</P>
<P N="2">2. We may con&s;ider on what Condition this Promi&s;e is made. And there are here &s;everal Things required of the Per&s;ons to whom it is conditionally propos'd. And here, before I in&s;tance in the Things required, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve in general with Re&s;pect to them, that none of them have, nor in Rea&s;on can have, any Thing in them that does imply, that the Per&s;ons to perform them mu&s;t, in order to it, be en|dowed with true &s;piritual Wi&s;dom, &s;uch as they are directed and en|couraged to &s;eek after; or that they are &s;uch as cannot be performed
<PB N="109" REF="005439_0124_101831fe11c116f8">
'till the &s;ame Kind of Wi&s;dom be fir&s;t obtained. The Rea&s;on of this is obvious. Every Thing here required, is required of &s;uch as have not the Kind of Wi&s;dom intended, and this in order to their getting of it. Now, what can be more ab&s;urd than to imagine, that the wi&s;e and in&s;pired <HI>Solomon</HI> did, in the Name of God, advi&s;e Per&s;ons de&s;titute of a certain Sort or Kind of Wi&s;dom, to labour to obtain the &s;ame, by performing certain Conditions, to the Performing of which their fir&s;t having the &s;ame Kind of Wi&s;dom was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary? This would be no le&s;s unrea&s;onable, than to advi&s;e a blind Man to make U&s;e of good Eye-&s;ight in &s;earching after Medicines to cure him of his Blindne&s;s. The Thing therefore required of unrege|nerate Per&s;ons, in order to their obtaining the Wi&s;dom here intended, cannot be &s;uch as cannot be done 'till they are fir&s;t endowed with that Kind of Wi&s;dom which they are called upon to &s;eek for: Nor will they appear to be &s;uch on a due Con&s;ideration of them. I will con|&s;ider them &s;everally.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing required is the receiving of the Words of him who &s;peaketh them. <HI>If thou wilt receive my Words,</HI> i. e. the Words of <HI>Solomon,</HI> or any other true Mini&s;ter's &s;peaking in God's Name: Or if we &s;ay the Word of God him&s;elf, it is the &s;ame Thing. This does not nece&s;&s;arily intend a receiving the Word of God in &s;uch a Manner as none but the regenerate receive it. It may be &s;uch a receiving of it as that intended, <HI>Matth.</HI> 13.20, 21. Nay, I &s;ay, it mu&s;t be &s;uch a receiving the Word as this; for this receiving it, as it re&s;pects many of tho&s;e who are &s;poken to, is only in order to their obtaining &s;aving Wi&s;dom, they being &s;till without it.</P>
<P>The next Thing required as the Condition of &s;uch Per&s;ons ob|taining true Wi&s;dom, is their <HI>hiding God's Commandments with them</HI>; and this may be done by Per&s;ons not yet regenerate, as by &s;ome awakened Sinner made &s;en&s;ible of his Sin and Guilt, and de&s;irous to know what he &s;hall do to be &s;aved. Is it not po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch an one to hear the Word of God with &s;ome Concern of Soul: Yea, to buy a Bible, and keep it by him, for his In&s;truction in the Way of Life; and frequently meditate on what he reads, and mark &s;uch Places in it as he thinks be&s;t &s;uits his Ca&s;e, committing others to Me|mory, with a De&s;ign not to forget them, but ob&s;erve and practice them? Or may we tell any one that does &s;o, that he is in a regene|rate State?</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="005439_0125_101831ad349f2d18">The next Thing required of &s;uch is, that they <HI>incline their Ears to Wi&s;dom, and apply their Hearts to Under&s;tanding,</HI> i. e. give them&s;elves to the Study of them, with &s;ome Affection and Delight. So Mr. POOL on the Place. But then, I &s;ay, this Affection and Delight re|quired, in order to their getting &s;piritual Wi&s;dom, mu&s;t be &s;uch as that mentioned in <HI>Matth.</HI> 13.20. becau&s;e the Per&s;ons here &s;poken to, as tho&s;e there mentioned, have no Root of &s;aving Grace in them, as was before declared. To <HI>apply the Heart to Wi&s;dom,</HI> may be as well under&s;tood of the Application of the Mind and Soul to the Study and Pur&s;uit of it, as to the actual Acqui&s;ition, or Exerci&s;e of it.</P>
<P>It is further required, in order to &s;uch Per&s;ons obtaining of Wi&s;dom, that they <HI>cry after Knowledge, and lift up their Voice for Under&s;tanding</HI>: That is, that they pray earne&s;tly to God for it, as in <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.5. Now is it not po&s;&s;ible for any unregenerate Per&s;on thus to do? If it be not, many others be&s;ides my &s;elf, are mi&s;taken with Re&s;pect to <HI>Ephraim,</HI> when he prays, <HI>Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned,</HI> Jer. 31.18. We frequently exhort and pre&s;s unregenerate Sinners to pray for the Grace of Regeneration, and con&s;equently for &s;piritual Wi&s;dom, which con|&s;i&s;ts in the Fear of the Lord, <HI>Job</HI> 28.28. Now I would know whe|ther we ought withal to tell them, that it is impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould do thus 'till after they have the Wi&s;dom which, being without, we advi&s;e them to &s;eek after. That it is not in their Power to change their own Hearts, I readily acknowledge; but that they are unable with God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance to Pray to him to do this for them, and this with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on at pre&s;ent to grant.</P>
<P>Another Duty or Condition required of unregenerate Sinners, in order to their getting this &s;piritual Wi&s;dom, is their <HI>&s;eeking it as Silver, and &s;earching for it as for hid Trea&s;ures</HI>: By which I think we may well under&s;tand, their indu&s;triou&s;ly attending all proper Means in order to their obtaining of it. Now I would know whether it be impo&s;&s;ible for any unregenerate Per&s;on, under the deepe&s;t Conviction of Sin, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Judgment, that &s;uch are capable of, to do this? Is it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for People, 'till after they are &s;avingly converted, and become wi&s;e to Salvation, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life, to <HI>&s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate,</HI> (as they are exhorted to do, <HI>Luke</HI> 13.24.) or to <HI>pre&s;s into</HI> (or towards) <HI>the Kingdom of God,</HI> (as in <HI>Luke</HI> 16.16.) 'till after they are actually <HI>in</HI> it? And do not Men begin to <HI>work out their own Salvation,</HI> 'till after they are <HI>in</HI> a State of Salvation, and have actually obtained eternal Life? I cannot think our doing thus is the Work only of one Moment; but includes in it
<PB N="111" REF="005439_0126_1018320051a17550">
our <HI>watching at Wi&s;dom's Gates, and waiting at the Po&s;ts of her Doors,</HI> (Prov. 8.34.) in order to our being made wi&s;e to Salvation, and not only after we are &s;o: And it may be compared with the poor Cripples waiting at the Pool of <HI>Bethe&s;da, John</HI> 5.2, 3. Can we truely affirm, that unregenerate Sinners neither can, nor ever do, thus wait on God in the U&s;e of Means for the converting Influences of his Spirit? Or for the Be&s;towment of true &s;piritual Wi&s;dom on them? Yea, let me a&s;k whether there have never been any unconverted Sinners that would rather have parted with all the Sub&s;tance of their Hou&s;es, than fail of true Conver&s;ion, and &s;o of eternal Happine&s;s? Yea, I would yet farther enquire, whether it is impo&s;&s;ible for any unconverted Sin|ner to do otherwi&s;e than that young Man did, who would not part with his outward E&s;tate, tho' his Soul lay at Stake? <HI>Matth.</HI> 19.22. For my part, I doubt not but that an unregenerate Sinner may re&s;i&s;t unto Blood fighting again&s;t Sin. Compare <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.12. with 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.3. Men's doing all that I have &s;poken of, will not prove them to be already wi&s;e to Salvation: And yet I do not believe that any that per&s;evere in &s;uch a Cour&s;e as this, &s;hall fail of the Grace of God, and finally peri&s;h.</P>
<P>Now this brings me to the Promi&s;e made in the Place under Con|&s;ideration, to tho&s;e that perform the Conditions thus required: And this we have in Ver&s;e 5. <HI>Then &s;halt thou under&s;tand the Fear of the Lord; and find the Knowledge of God.</HI> The Promi&s;e is very expre&s;s and peremptory; and I believe there are &s;carce any but what believe, that all who obtain the Good here promi&s;ed, are made wi&s;e to Sal|vation; not only brought nigh to the Kingdom of God, but actually into it. Tho&s;e who think that &s;uch Seekers are &s;o, who are de&s;cribed in the foregoing Ver&s;es, will doubtle&s;s acknowledge, that they mu&s;t needs be &s;o, unto whom the Promi&s;e made in Ver&s;e 5 is fulfilled. Whe Words of the Promi&s;e here made, do certainly &s;ignify the &s;aving Illumination and In&s;truction of tho&s;e happy Souls that partake of the Good expre&s;&s;ed in it. None can doubt of this that will be at the Trouble to compare this Promi&s;e with what we have in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 25.14. and 51.6. and 19.18, 19. 1 <HI>John</HI> 2.27. <HI>John</HI> 17.8. <HI>Prov.</HI> 3.13. and Chap. 2.10, 11. Such as are wi&s;e to Salvation know the Wi&s;dom here intended to be that mentioned <HI>Job.</HI> 28.28. and <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 111.10.</P>
<P>We have in the Place under Con&s;ideration a Rea&s;on given to con|firm to us the Truth of the Promi&s;e made, Ver&s;e 6. <HI>For the Lord giveth Wi&s;dom: Out of his Mouth cometh Knowledge and Under&s;tanding,</HI>
<PB N="112" REF="005439_0127_101831af2fc88b40">
i. e. he that thus promi&s;eth to be&s;tow &s;piritual Wi&s;dom on &s;uch as come up to the Terms on which it is offered, is the Lord Jehovah, who is the only and all-&s;ufficient Giver of that Wi&s;dom, by which Men are made <HI>wi&s;e to Salvation</HI>; he being the <HI>Father of Lights, from whom every good and perfect Gift cometh down,</HI> Jam. 1.17. Therefore we may a&s;&s;uredly depend on him for the Good thus promi&s;ed, if we take the Cour&s;e which he directeth us to for the obtaining of it.</P>
<P>I may now proceed to the other Te&s;timony I intended, for the Confirmation of what I have a&s;&s;erted; and that is in the new Te&s;ta|ment, Jam. 1.5. <HI>If any of you lack Wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k it of God, that giveth to all Men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it &s;hall be given to him.</HI></P>
<P>This Text is very much like that la&s;t produced and vindicated; and therefore I &s;hall need &s;ay the le&s;s upon it. The fir&s;t Thing that I &s;hall &s;ay on it is, that the Thing promi&s;ed in it is <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI>; and this doubtle&s;s the &s;ame Kind of Wi&s;dom as that de&s;cribed by the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, Chap. 3. Ver&s;e 17. <HI>The Wi&s;dom that is from above, is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be entreated, full of Mercy, and good Fruits, without Partiality and without Hypocri&s;y.</HI> By which Wi&s;|dom the Apo&s;tle doubtle&s;s intendeth that which is truly &s;piritual and &s;aving; and this not only Wi&s;dom nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ome particular Ca&s;e, as when Per&s;ons are under Affliction and Tribulation, as in the fore|going Ver&s;es, but al&s;o in every other Ca&s;e; &s;uch as is intended <HI>Job</HI> 28.28. and <HI>Prov.</HI> 2.10.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ons to whom this Promi&s;e is made are any that lack Wi&s;|dom, as in the Text, <HI>If any of you lack Wi&s;dom</HI>&mdash;. For tho' this Epi&s;tle was more immediately written to tho&s;e mentioned in the In|&s;cription of it, Chap. 1. Ver&s;e 1. yet it was no Doubt intended for the In&s;truction and &s;piritual Good of all that read it? For thus the Spirit of God &s;peaking in the Scripture, is to be under&s;tood, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.29. <HI>Mark</HI> 13.37. And who is there that <HI>lacketh</HI> this Kind of Wi&s;dom more than tho&s;e do, that have none of it; which is the Ca&s;e of all unregenerate Per&s;ons. But if it &s;hould be here &s;aid, that by &s;uch as lack this Wi&s;dom, we may under&s;tand &s;uch as are &s;en&s;ible of their Need of it; to this I an&s;wer, That tho' I cannot believe that the Direction here is given only to &s;uch, ina&s;much as it may encourage tho&s;e that are not yet duly &s;en&s;ible how much they need it, to endeavour to become &s;o; yet &s;uppo&s;ing this to be true, there is no Rea&s;on to que&s;|tion, but that Per&s;ons &s;till in an unregenerate State may be &s;en&s;ible that they need &s;piritual Wi&s;dom. Tho&s;e that are &s;en&s;ible that they need
<PB N="113" REF="005439_0128_10183201f84f0230">
Happine&s;s: And I believe it is po&s;&s;ible, that an unregenerate Per&s;on may be convinced that it is impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould be made truly happy and ble&s;&s;ed, without being made &s;piritually wi&s;e. I know that natural Men are apt to place their Happine&s;s in &s;en&s;ual Objects; but is it not po&s;&s;ible for them to be convinced of their Error and Mi&s;take in this, 'till after they are &s;avingly converted? I incline to tell People who are convinced of this, that it belongs to the Work ordinarily required as <HI>preparatory</HI> to Conver&s;ion, rather than as an e&s;&s;ential Ingredient in it: For how &s;hould any &s;incerely turn to God, 'till fir&s;t convinced of the Vanity of the Creature? If an awaken'd Sinner tells me, he is convinced that Nothing in any Creature, or in all of them together, can make him truly happy, I cannot, on this Account, tho' I believe him, a&s;&s;ure him that he is in a converted State.</P>
<P>The next Thing to be con&s;idered is, the Condition required in order to the obtaining the Wi&s;dom intended; and this is, that they <HI>a&s;k it of God, who giveth liberally, and upbraideth not.</HI> Here ob&s;erve, (1) That &s;uch as need this Wi&s;dom are required to a&s;k for it. (2) They are required, in a&s;king it, to apply to a right Object, <HI>viz.</HI> God. (3) Here is &s;omething to encourage them to do &s;o, <HI>viz. He giveth liberally, and upbraideth not.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1) If Sinners need &s;piritual Wi&s;dom, they mu&s;t a&s;k for it. The Way of obtaining it is not to acquire it by hard Study, but by Prayer. There is a Sort of Wi&s;dom that may be acquired by Study and Me|ditation, as other acquired Gifts and Qualifications are; but this is not of that Kind, nor obtained in that Way, (tho' nece&s;&s;ary in the Work preparatory to it) but by fervent Prayer, called in Scripture <HI>a&s;king, &s;eeking, knocking,</HI> Matth. 7.7, 8. <HI>Luke</HI> 11.9, 10.</P>
<P N="2">(2) Tho&s;e that de&s;ire this Wi&s;dom mu&s;t &s;eek it of a right Object, who is able and willing to be&s;tow it, <HI>viz.</HI> God. So in the Text, <HI>Let him a&s;k it of God.</HI> The mo&s;t learned Men in the World cannot give this Wi&s;dom, by the be&s;t In&s;tructions they can afford: Only God can do this, as we &s;aw before. Prov. 2.6. <HI>The Lord giveth Wi&s;dom: Out of his Mouth cometh Knowledge and Under&s;tanding.</HI> And this Knowledge cometh out of God's Mouth, not only by Means of the Scriptures which he has given by the In&s;piration of his Spirit; but as the Light did which he gave in the Creation of the World, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.3. with which we may compare, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.6. And I may add,
<PB N="114" REF="005439_0129_101831b2c8cc03a0">
that when we a&s;k this Wi&s;dom, we mu&s;t a&s;k it in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as we mu&s;t all other Mercies.</P>
<P N="3">(3) Here is Ground of Encouragement thus to a&s;k this Wi&s;dom of God, <HI>viz. He giveth liberally, and upbraideth not</HI>: He giveth to all that a&s;k for it as they ought to do. He giveth not as Per&s;ons of nar|row Souls are wont to give their Gifts; nor does he twit and upbraid tho&s;e who in their Straits &s;eek his Favours: And this, if there had been no more &s;aid, gives great Encouragement to a&s;k &s;piritual Wi&s;|dom of him.</P>
<P>But as if this was not enough, there is in the Words a po&s;itive Pro|mi&s;e, that tho&s;e who a&s;k it in the Manner required, &s;hall obtain it: <HI>It &s;hall be given him</HI>; exactly an&s;wering to what we had before in Prov. 2.5. <HI>Then &s;halt thou under&s;tand the Fear of the Lord; and find the Knowledge of God.</HI></P>
<P>But I expect that, again&s;t what I plead for the Support of my Hy|pothe&s;is from this Text, what follows in the two next Ver&s;es will be objected, <HI>viz. But let him a&s;k in Faith, nothing wavering: For he that wavereth is like a Wave of the Sea, driven with the Wind, and to&s;&s;ed. For let not that Man think that he &s;hall receive any Thing of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>If the&s;e Words be objected again&s;t what I hold and plead for, I &s;uppo&s;e the Strength of the Objection (if it have any) depends on this, that &s;uch a Kind of Faith as that de&s;cribed Ver&s;e 6. is required to &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;sful a&s;king of Wi&s;dom as that &s;poken of in Ver&s;e 5. is what an unregenerate Sinner cannot po&s;&s;ibly be the Subject of, but &s;uch only as are already in a regenerate State, and &s;o truly and &s;piri|tually wi&s;e; and that the Wi&s;dom promi&s;ed to be given to &s;uch a&s;kers of it as are intended in the Place, mu&s;t be <HI>more</HI> of the &s;ame Kind that they are endowed with.</P>
<P>Now in An&s;wer to this &s;everal Things may be &s;aid,</P>
<P N="1">1. I readily grant, that the A&s;king intended in Ver&s;e 5. mu&s;t be an A&s;king in Faith: Otherwi&s;e it is not &s;uch as the Promi&s;e is there made to. And indeed it is, I think, impo&s;&s;ible, that any Prayer at all &s;hould be made to God, without &s;ome Kind of Faith in him. Prayer is a coming to God for the Favours we need, and de&s;ire him to grant to us. But we are a&s;&s;ured in Heb. 11.6. that, <HI>he that cometh to God mu&s;t believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him.</HI> So that there can be no &s;uch Thing as coming to God without believing in him. To the &s;ame Effect is it demanded in
<PB N="115" REF="005439_0130_1018320730ea9928">
Rom. 10.14. <HI>How &s;hall they call on him, in whom they have not be|lieved?</HI> As Men cannot, in a gracious and holy Manner, come to or call upon God, without that Kind of Faith which is peculiar to Per|&s;ons in a ju&s;tified and regenerate State; &s;o they cannot, in any Man|ner, draw near to God, and call on his Name, without &s;ome Kind of Faith; at lea&s;t &s;uch as unregenerate Per&s;ons may be the Subjects of.</P>
<P N="2">2. I affirm, that it is po&s;&s;ible for unregenerate Per&s;ons to believe in God, and in his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Many &s;uch have believed. Many unregenerate Per&s;ons have believed there is a God, <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.19. And many unregenerate Per&s;ons have had Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as is evident in <HI>John</HI> 2.23, 24. and Chap. 12.42, 43. <HI>Acts</HI> 8.13. <HI>Matth.</HI> 13.20, 21. <HI>Luke</HI> 8.13. That Text therefore, 1 John 5.1. <HI>Who&s;oever believeth that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, is born of God,</HI> mu&s;t be under&s;tood of a Kind of Faith or Believing peculiar to God's Elect, already in a regenerate State. The &s;ame may be &s;aid concerning <HI>Peter</HI>'s Faith, <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.16, 17. and their's al&s;o in <HI>Acts</HI> 13.48. Otherwi&s;e I know of no Propo&s;ition in our holy Religion but what may be believed or a&s;&s;ented unto by Per&s;ons in an unregenerate State. Unregenerate Per&s;ons have the &s;ame objective Revelation of divine Truths, and the &s;ame rational Evidence to ground their Per&s;ua&s;ion of them upon, as the Regenerate have; and this Evidence is &s;ufficient to demand their A&s;&s;ent, and to command it, did they not wilfully refu&s;e to attend to it. If this were not &s;o, unregenerate Per&s;ons that do not a&s;&s;ent to divine Truths might ju&s;tify their not believing: For no Man is bound to believe that, of which he has not, or cannot have, &s;ufficient Evidence. For,</P>
<P N="3">3. Unregenerate Per&s;ons are able to under&s;tand the Evidence given or offered to them, to &s;atisfy them of the Truth of tho&s;e Things which they are required to believe; &s;o that if they believe them not, 'tis becau&s;e they &s;hun the Light, and will not con&s;ider as they may and ought to do, tho&s;e Evidences which God favours them with; having an Enmity in their Hearts again&s;t the Truths and Objects re|vealed.</P>
<P N="4">4. All unregenerate Sinners do not thus ob&s;tinately &s;hut their Eyes again&s;t the Light. They are by common Grace prevail'd with to make a better Improvement of the Advantages they enjoy, than others do. Nor is the Sin of tho&s;e that refu&s;e In&s;truction, in this Way offe|red
<PB N="116" REF="005439_0131_101831b6abda6cd8">
to them, unavoidable, &s;o that they cannot come to the Knowledge of the Truth, but mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily remain Infidels or Unbelievers.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Per&s;ua&s;ion which &s;ome unregenerate Sinners do, in this Way, attain, is &s;o firm and &s;trong, that it has a great Influence on their Lives. They receive the Word with Joy, and do many Things that are required of them. Such a Per&s;ua&s;ion as the&s;e have, or may have, of the Truth, is &s;ufficient to produce <HI>Repentance in Sackcloth and A&s;hes</HI>; in&s;omuch that &s;uch are &s;ometimes &s;aid to have <HI>e&s;caped the Pol|lutions that are in the World, thro' the Knowledge of our Lord and Sa|viour Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 2 Pet. 2.20, 21. and to have been <HI>enlightned,</HI> and to have <HI>ta&s;ted the heavenly Gift,</HI> and to have been <HI>made Partakers of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and to have <HI>ta&s;ted the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come,</HI> Heb. 6.4, 5.</P>
<P>Such an A&s;&s;urance of divine Truths as Per&s;ons not &s;avingly con|verted may, in this Way attain, is &s;ufficient to render them utterly inexcu&s;able if they engage not in the Practice of religious Duties, &s;uch as Praying to God in publick, private and &s;ecret; and Waiting on him in all the other Ways of his own Appointment, for his &s;aving and everla&s;ting Mercies, and in particular for that &s;piritual Wi&s;dom here under Con&s;ideration: So that &s;uch Per&s;ons need not be at &s;uch Uncertainties, with Re&s;pect to the Truth of God's Word, as not to a&s;k the&s;e Mercies in <HI>Faith</HI>; e&s;pecially if they are taught, as I think they &s;hould be, that God has firmly <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> the&s;e &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings to tho&s;e that, in a right Manner, a&s;k them of him. They may then <HI>a&s;k them in Faith without wavering, like a Wave of the Sea, that is driven with the Wind, and to&s;&s;ed,</HI> as in the Text objected: Or like <HI>double-minded Men who are un&s;table in all their Ways,</HI> Ver&s;e 8. But on the contrary, they may with &s;ome Steadfa&s;tne&s;s and Con&s;tancy, <HI>watch at Wi&s;dom's Gates,</HI> &amp;c. Prov. 8.34. and not <HI>grow weary in well-doing,</HI> nor <HI>draw back to Perdition,</HI> as &s;ome do. See <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.13. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.38. <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.12, 13.</P>
<P>I might have here &s;hown the Difference betwixt this Kind of Faith, and that peculiar to the Regenerate; but for this I &s;hall refer my Reader to Chap. III. of this &s;econd Part of my E&s;&s;ay: And I &s;hall hereafter have Occa&s;ion to &s;ay &s;omething further to it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. That the conditional Promi&s;es of &s;pecial Mercy made to &s;uch as come to <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> do contain and imply in them a Promi&s;e of rengenerating Grace.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Promi&s;es which I here intend are &s;uch as the&s;e following, <HI>viz.</HI> Matth. 11.28. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you Re&s;t.</HI> John 6.35. <HI>And Je&s;us &s;aid unto them, I am the Bread of Life: He that cometh to me &s;hall never Hunger; and he that believeth on me &s;hall never Thir&s;t.</HI> So again in Ver&s;e 37. <HI>All that the Father giveth me, &s;hall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI> Such a Promi&s;e is al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed and implied in John 5.40. <HI>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</HI> In the&s;e Places Je&s;us Chri&s;t freely invites all &s;inful Men, to whom the Go&s;pel is preached, to come to him for Life and Happine&s;s, promi&s;ing that if they do, they &s;hall ob|tain what they come to him for.</P>
<P>Now, this being allowed, as I think it cannot be denied, I &s;hall here briefly con&s;ider (1) What the Promi&s;es are which Sinners &s;hould go to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for. (2) How they &s;hould go to Chri&s;t for the&s;e Benefits. (3) The Security given them, that &s;o doing, they &s;hall obtain them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us con&s;ider what tho&s;e Benefits are which Sinners are in|vited to go to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for. Now to this I &s;ay in general, that there is no Rea&s;on to doubt but that they are invited to go to Chri&s;t for all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, or for all tho&s;e everla&s;ting Mercies which he freely be&s;tows on all tho&s;e whom he eternally &s;aves; all that Ful|ne&s;s which he has in him&s;elf, and which is by his People derived from him, as in <HI>Col.</HI> 1.19. <HI>John</HI> 1.14, 16. That Pardon of Sin, or Ju&s;tification and Adoption are among tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, which Sinners are invited to go to Chri&s;t for, is not, I think, at all que&s;tion'd a|mong

us; and &s;o al&s;o the Happine&s;s enjoy'd by true Saints in their Communion with God here in this Life, and in that which is to come.</P>
<P>All the Que&s;tion here is, whether unregenerate Sinners who enjoy &s;uch Invitations by the Go&s;pel, as tho&s;e above expre&s;&s;ed, are not there|in invited to go to Je&s;us Chri&s;t al&s;o for that Principle of &s;piritual Life which is given in Regeneration? And this I am per&s;uaded they are; and can hardly think that any orthodox Divine will deny it. Is not every unregenerate Sinner who enjoys the Go&s;pel, bound to pray as <HI>David</HI> did in P&s;al. 51.10. <HI>Create in me a clean Heart, O God; and renew a right Spirit within me.</HI> Indeed, we have no Rea&s;on to doubt of <HI>David</HI>'s being in a regenerate State, when he thus prayed: But it being after his great Sin and Fall, as appears by the Title of the P&s;alm, and is further confirmed by the Contents of it, he may be ju&s;tly &s;up|po&s;ed to have been under a Cloud, with re&s;pect to his &s;piritual State, and to have wanted that Sen&s;e of God's Love, which formerly he en|joyed. Several of his Expre&s;&s;ions in the P&s;alm lead us to think &s;o; it is therefore no Wonder if he now called the Sincerity of his Heart, and the Truth of his Conver&s;ion, in Que&s;tion, and &s;o prayed for a new Heart, as if he had never before had &s;uch an Heart given to him: But he could not de&s;ire this but only on Suppo&s;ition that he had not already what he was concerned that he might not fail of. And thus any Saint that knows not that he is already in a regenerate State, may pray that he may be born again. And tho&s;e that are indeed de&s;titute of true Grace &s;hould pray for it as <HI>Ephraim</HI> did, Jer. 31.18. <HI>Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned</HI>: And that is to go to Chri&s;t, and to God in and by him, for it. We are told, in Acts 5.31. That <HI>he is exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour; to grant Repentance and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins</HI>; no Doubt the Grace of true Repentance, as well as the Acts and Ex|erci&s;es of it: And this &s;hews us that Sinners &s;hould go to him for this Grace, as unto one that has the Words of eternal Life, <HI>John</HI> 6.68. The wicked <HI>Jews</HI> refu&s;ing to do this, was no Doubt one great Part of the Crime with which our Lord charged them, John 5.40. <HI>Ye will not come unto me that ye might have Life.</HI> Or, &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e they were only to go to Chri&s;t for Pardon, and not for the Grace of Rege|neration, which he al&s;o merited for his People, and which they can <HI>have</HI> no other Way than thro' him, who is that Head of Influence, by which his whole Body is animated and nouri&s;hed,; and who <HI>having Life in him&s;elf, quickneth whom he will,</HI> Col. 1.18, 19. and <HI>John</HI> 1.16. and <HI>Chap.</HI> 5.26, 27. Thus, I think it is &s;ufficiently evident, that unregenerate Per&s;ons ought to go to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for &s;piritual Life, or for the Grace of Regeneration.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="119" REF="005439_0134_1018320e64e0c008">2. I am to &s;hew how Sinners are to go to him for this Grace. And here I will venture to &s;ay <HI>negatively,</HI> They are not required to go to him for it in the Exerci&s;e of the &s;ame Kind of Grace. Is it po&s;&s;ible for any rational Men to think, that God requiring unregenerate Sin|ners to go to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for a Principle of &s;piritual Life, which they are yet without, would require them to come to him for it, in the Ex|erci&s;e of that very &s;ame Kind of Grace which he requires them to &s;eek after, and beg for? This is too ab&s;urd to be believed.</P>
<P>What then, are the Unregenerate in &s;eeking to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for the Grace of Regeneration, required to come to him in Faith, or without any? Surely they are not required to come to Chri&s;t without Faith: That would be a &s;trange Way of coming, if any at all. How &s;hould they come to their Saviour without having any Faith in him? It is impo&s;&s;ible. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.6. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.14. How &s;hould Per&s;ons call on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as in Mat. 8.25. <HI>Lord, &s;ave us, we peri&s;h</HI>; or as in Ver&s;e 2. <HI>Lord, if thou wilt, thou can&s;t make me clean,</HI> if they do not believe him able to do the&s;e Things for them? And the Rea&s;on is the &s;ame if we go to him for a new Heart, or to give us &s;piritual Life.</P>
<P>But how &s;hould Per&s;ons go to Chri&s;t <HI>in Faith,</HI> for &s;uch a Mercy, who are not yet born again?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, That the <HI>My&s;tery is this,</HI> that Per&s;ons may have Faith in Chri&s;t, tho' they are not yet born of the Spirit, as in <HI>John</HI> 3.16, or have not yet been <HI>made Partakers of the divine Nature,</HI> as in 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.4. I have proved this in Chap. XII. to which I here refer my Rea|der. And I am not yet convinced, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for a Sinner not yet born of God, and that has no other Faith than a Per&s;on in that E&s;tate may have, to go to Chri&s;t for regenerating Grace, or for a new Heart; but I am thoro'ly convinced, that no Sinner is required to go to Chri&s;t for the Grace of Regeneration, in the Exerci&s;e of the &s;ame Kind of Grace.</P>

<P>_I IN the pre&s;ent Argument, join together the two Sorts of Promi&s;es mentioned, becau&s;e of their near Relation one to the other; the End of Per&s;everance being our overcoming the Evils we have to meet with, in the Way that leadeth to eternal Life.</P>
<P>However, I &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider tho&s;e Promi&s;es of Salvation, which are made to &s;uch as per&s;evere: And here I &s;hall <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;hew that there are &s;everal &s;uch Promi&s;es: And then, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> make it evident that the&s;e contain an Offer of regene|rating Grace in them.</P>

el&s;ewhere in Scripture called <HI>eternal Life</HI>: And that the Condi|tion on which this Salvation is offered, is Per&s;everance, is, I think, undeniable. It is called, in the Words under Con&s;ideration, <HI>Endu|ring to the End,</HI> the direct contrary to that <HI>Enduring</HI> and <HI>Believing</HI> only <HI>for a while,</HI> which Apo&s;tates are chargeable with, as appears in <HI>Matth.</HI> 13.21. <HI>Mark</HI> 4.17. and <HI>Luke</HI> 8.13. Such a Promi&s;e is that al&s;o in <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 6.4. Such a Promi&s;e is al&s;o in Ho&s;. 6.3. <HI>Then &s;hall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: His going forth is pre|pared as the Morning; and he &s;hall come unto us as the Rain; as the lat|ter and former Rain unto the Earth. To follow on to know the Lord,</HI> is to per&s;evere in our Endeavours to get that &s;aving Acquaintance with him, &s;poken of <HI>Job</HI> 22.21. And his <HI>coming unto &s;uch as the Rain,</HI> doubtle&s;s importeth the plentiful Effu&s;ion of the Holy Spirit on them, in his converting and &s;aving Influences, as in <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.23. and <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 44.34, 35. Another &s;uch Promi&s;e we have in Gal. 6.9. <HI>Let us not be weary in Well-doing, for in due Time we &s;hall reap, if we faint not.</HI> Which Promi&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, to be given to &s;uch as have begun to &s;eek the Lord, whether they are in a regenerate State or not. With the&s;e Texts we may compare what we have in <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.23. and Ver&s;e 35,&mdash;39. which I may hereafter have Occa&s;ion to con&s;ider. Al&s;o that in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.24, 26. Some there are that fail and fall &s;hort of eternal Life and Happine&s;s, by Means of their Apo&s;tacy from God, and their Duty; but the&s;e are not &s;uch as have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, but &s;uch as have been in the Way to obtain this Mercy.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall now proceed to &s;hew that &s;uch Promi&s;es as the&s;e contain in them an Offer of the Grace given in Regeneration. And to make this good, the fir&s;t Thing I &s;hall &s;ay is, that they are not made to &s;uch as are already in a State of Grace and Salvation, <HI>i. e.</HI> to &s;uch as are in a regenerate and ju&s;tified State, and &s;o already <HI>pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life,</HI> as in <HI>John</HI> 5.24. and 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.14. God does not tell &s;uch as the&s;e, that if they do not <HI>fall from Grace,</HI> and again become &s;uch as the <HI>unregenerate</HI> are, they &s;hall be &s;aved; as if their future Salvation were &s;till &s;u&s;pended on this Condition, that they re|main true Believers all the Days of their Lives. Such as the&s;e have already performed the Conditions on which Salvation is offered to Sinners, and have begun to partake of that Salvation, which God be|&s;tows on all who comply with the Terms of the new Covenant; and all that remains nece&s;&s;ary for the perfecting of it is by the Promi&s;e and Oath of God &s;ecured to them. They may depend upon his per|fecting all that concerns them, even their Per&s;everance in Faith and Holine&s;s to the End is fully &s;ecured to them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 32.40. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.
<PB N="122" REF="005439_0137_101831c1810b3258">
3, 4, 5. The Promi&s;e of Salvation which they have already a Right unto, includes in it a Promi&s;e of their Per&s;everance, in Faith and Holine&s;s, even unto Death. Their Per&s;everance therefore, rather dependeth on their Salvation, than their Salvation on their Per&s;eve|rance: How then can their eternal Salvation be &s;u&s;pended on this Condition, if they per&s;evere. I wonder any <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI> &s;hould thus ex|pound the mentioned Promi&s;es &s;o very incon&s;i&s;tently with the Principles profe&s;&s;ed by them, and, as I &s;hall &s;hew, with the plain Sen&s;e of the Places wherein &s;uch Promi&s;es are found. It is too late to tell Men they &s;hall be &s;aved on thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or that Condition, after their Salvation is fully &s;ecured, with all Things nece&s;&s;arily implied in it.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> Thing which I have to &s;ay re&s;pecting the Promi&s;es under Con&s;ideration, is, that they &s;uppo&s;e the Per&s;ons to whom they are made, to be already &s;o far forth qualified Subjects to partake of the Good promi&s;ed, that Nothing is wanting in order to it, but their Continuance or Per&s;everance in the Way of Duty, in which they are at pre&s;ent walking: For Per&s;everance is all that is now demanded of them, in order to their being Partakers of the Benefits conditionally promi&s;ed to them. Unto &s;uch therefore <HI>that</HI> belongs, Heb. 10.36. <HI>Ye have need of Patience, that after ye have done the Will of God, ye might receive the Promi&s;e.</HI> Unto tho&s;e al&s;o that is &s;poken Gal. 6.9. <HI>Let us not be weary in Well-doing,</HI> &amp;c. Not that &s;uch Per&s;ons have already a Right to the &s;aving Mercies of the new Covenant; but be|cau&s;e in due Time they &s;hall have an Intere&s;t in them, if they go on in the Way they are in, and do not grow weary and give out. Com|pare with the Text la&s;t mentioned, that in <HI>Luke</HI> 18.1, 7. The Per&s;ons therefore, unto whom &s;uch Promi&s;es are made, are (tho' not in a regenerate State) &s;uch as are <HI>&s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait Gate,</HI> Luke 13.24. Or <HI>pre&s;&s;ing to enter into the Kingdom of God,</HI> (or to|wards it) <HI>Luke</HI> 16.16. being &s;uch convinced and awakened Sinners as have <HI>begun to work out their own Salvation with Fear and Trembling,</HI> Phil. 2.12. and con&s;equently are &s;uch as believe the Word of God, both Law and Go&s;pel, tho' not with that Kind of Faith as is infu&s;ed into Men's Souls, in their Regeneration. And tho' they are not &s;avingly converted, in the Sen&s;e in which that Expre&s;&s;ion is generally u&s;ed; yet they have a Repentance like that intended in <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.21. and are &s;uch as have <HI>e&s;caped the Pollutions that are in the World, thro' the Knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 2 Pet. 2.20. And are al&s;o in a <HI>Way of Well-doing, watching at Wi&s;dom's Gates, and waiting at the Po&s;ts of her Doors,</HI> Prov. 8, 34.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="005439_0138_10183216794d2c98">Thus the Per&s;ons intended are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;erious and diligent Seekers of God, in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for his &s;pecial and &s;a|ving Mercies, tho' not in a regenerate and ju&s;tified E&s;tate. And Per&s;ons qualified as now expre&s;&s;ed, are, I &s;ay, qualified to be Parta|kers of the &s;aving Benefits offered in the new Covenant; &s;o that 'tis no Ways incon&s;i&s;tent with the Truth, Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s of God, to be&s;tow the&s;e &s;aving and eternal Mercies on them: Yet he has not bound him&s;elf by any Promi&s;e, that he will immediately &s;ave a Sinner &s;o qualified; but is plea&s;ed to require Sinners under &s;uch Preparations to wait on him during his Plea&s;ure, for the Be&s;towment of the &s;ame upon them: Only he has, (as I think) for their Encouragement, en|gaged that they &s;hall in due Time <HI>reap</HI> the&s;e Fruits of his &s;pecial Fa|vour <HI>if they faint not.</HI></P>
<P>And now, that Per&s;ons may be thus qualified to be Partakers of God's everla&s;ting Mercies, and yet not immediately have the &s;ame be&s;towed on them, but be obliged to wait God's Time, under &s;uch Preparations, and this under Pain of falling finally &s;hort of the Mercies which they &s;eek, in Ca&s;e they per&s;evere not, I &s;hall endeavour a little further to clear up.</P>
<P>This would indeed be impo&s;&s;ible, if that Kind of Faith, by Divines called <HI>Fides infu&s;a,</HI> were the Condition of the new Covenant; be|cau&s;e &s;uch Faith nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;eth all that have it to be in a State of Salvation, as I have already &s;hewed. But that Kind of Faith and Repentance, which I look upon as the Condition of the Covenant of Grace, is evidently, in the Nature of it, &s;uch as Per&s;ons may have before they are in a State of Salvation; and therefore it may be a Truth, (and indeed it evidently is &s;o) that Per&s;everance is required of &s;uch as would be Partakers of God's &s;aving Mercies, in order to their obtaining them; and not only that for a Moment they are qua|lified, as has been expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This will be further manife&s;t, if we con&s;ider, that we may well di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt a Condition on which a Benefit is offered, con&s;i|dered materially, or in Re&s;pect of the Act or Acts wherein it con&s;i&s;t|eth; and con&s;idered with Re&s;pect to the Prolongation or Continuance of the Thing required: If we con&s;ider the Nature of the Things re|quired, Per&s;ons may, in that Re&s;pect, have all that is demanded of them, and yet not have a Right to the Benefits conditionally promi&s;ed; becau&s;e they have not continued the Qualifications demanded, &s;o long as is required of them, in order to their having a Right.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="005439_0139_101831c3c8339048">Thus in the fir&s;t Covenant made with Man, he might for a Time continue in that Obedience which was required of him, and yet have no Right to the Life conditionally promi&s;ed; becau&s;e he had not &s;tood in Innocency the whole Term of that State of Probation which was by God de&s;igned for his Trial. And I know no Rea&s;on why it may not be &s;o under the new Covenant al&s;o; nay, it &s;eems certainly to be &s;o, ina&s;much as God does not only require &s;uch Qualifications as are mentioned in the Covenant, but al&s;o Per&s;everance in the Per|formance of what is required; that is, God requires that we keep Covenant with him, in order to his &s;aving us; and this not by one tran&s;ient Act only, but by our con&s;tant Obedience to his Command|ments, 'till we obtain his offered Mercies, as in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 25.10. and 103.17, 18.</P>
<P>That the Sen&s;e which I have given of the Promi&s;es under Con&s;ide|ration, is very agreeable with the Scope of the Places wherein we find them, will (I think) appear if we con&s;ider them in Connection with the Context, to which they re&s;pectively belong. In that <HI>Matth.</HI> 10.22. tho&s;e Chri&s;tians to whom the Promi&s;e intended has a Re|ference, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be liable to violent Per&s;ecutions, under which they would be in great Danger of falling away, as &s;tony-ground Hearers are many of them &s;uppo&s;ed to do, in <HI>Matth.</HI> 13.20, 21. and in the other Evangeli&s;ts. They are therefore encouraged with a Promi&s;e of Salvation, in Ca&s;e they &s;hould per&s;evere, which they would not have been in Danger of not doing, if they had been <HI>pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life,</HI> in the Sen&s;e intended in <HI>John</HI> 5.24. Tho&s;e in <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.13. are &s;poken to as liable to grievous Temptations, by Rea&s;on of that abounding of Iniquity there foretold, which &s;hould occa&s;ion <HI>the Love of many to wax cold,</HI> as in Ver&s;e 12. and &s;o are encouraged to take Heed of Apo&s;tacy, from the Con&s;ideration of that gracious Pro|mi&s;e made to &s;uch as per&s;evere; <HI>viz.</HI> that if they &s;hould <HI>endure to the End,</HI> they &s;hould <HI>be &s;aved</HI>; they believing only <HI>for a while,</HI> as in <HI>Luke</HI> 8.13. I may here add, that when &s;ome, in the mentioned Place, <HI>Matth.</HI> 13. have Salvation promi&s;ed to them, in Ca&s;e they &s;hould not fall away, as others would do; the Antithe&s;is expre&s;&s;ed in the Words plainly &s;hew, that the &s;ame Kind of Faith or Religion is intended in both Ca&s;es: So that of the &s;ame Sort of Believers &s;ome might fall away, and peri&s;h, and others per&s;evere, and be &s;aved: And if tho&s;e who are &s;uppo&s;ed to fall away, &s;hould not do &s;o, but &s;hould continue to believe, they &s;hould be &s;aved al&s;o.</P>
<P>The like may be &s;aid with Re&s;pect to that Text, Heb. 10.36, 38, 39. <HI>Ye have Need of Patience; that after ye have done the Will of God,
<PB N="125" REF="005439_0140_1018321808aa1fd8">
ye may receive the Promi&s;e. Now the Ju&s;t &s;hall live by Faith: But if any Man</HI> (or, as it is in the Original, I am told, <HI>if he) draw back, my Soul &s;hall have no Plea&s;ure in him. But we are not of them that draw back unto Perdition, but of them that believe to the &s;aving of the Soul.</HI> I believe it can never be proved that the Faith intended in Ver&s;e 38. is that which is peculiar to the Regenerate; but the contrary &s;eems evident. I grant that, according to the Text, the Faith intended is of the &s;ame Kind with that by which the Ju&s;t do live, that is, it is of the &s;ame Kind of Faith with that which is required as the Conditi|on of the Covenant of Grace: And what Kind of Faith that is, I have &s;ufficiently &s;hewed, and proved it cannot be that given in Regenera|tion. Moreover, when it is &s;aid, That <HI>the Ju&s;t &s;hall live by Faith,</HI> and it thereupon followeth, <HI>If any Man draw back,</HI> &amp;c. it &s;eemeth evident, that the &s;ame Kind of Faith is by &s;ome fallen from, which others per&s;evere in the Exerci&s;e of, to the &s;aving of their Souls. Therefore, when it is &s;aid, <HI>The Ju&s;t &s;hall live by Faith,</HI> the Meaning is, That he &s;hall do &s;o, in Ca&s;e he per&s;evere in Believing, and con|tinueth a ju&s;t and righteous Man, in the Sen&s;e in which he is at pre|&s;ent &s;uch an one; which many not doing, God's Soul has no &s;uch Plea&s;ure in them, as he has in tho&s;e who &s;o do. And tho' &s;uch as are the Subjects of the Faith intended, are called <HI>Ju&s;t,</HI> this may not intend that they are &s;o in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e of that Word, any more than that the Term <HI>Righteous,</HI> mu&s;t be &s;o taken, in (what I think to be) a parallel Place, in Ezek. 18.24, 26. <HI>But if the Righteous turneth away from his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and commit Iniquity, and doth according to the Abominations that the wicked Man doth, &s;hall he live? All his Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s that he hath done, &s;hall not be mentioned; in his Tre&s;pa&s;s that he hath tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed, and in his Sin that he hath &s;inned, in them &s;hall he die. When a righteous Man turneth away from his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and commit|teth Iniquity, and dieth in them, for his Iniquity that he hath done &s;hall he die.</HI> In which Words it is to me &s;o evident, that by a righteous Man, a regenerate Saint cannot be intended, that I think I need not &s;pend Time in making the &s;ame manife&s;t, nor am I alone in this Tho't; &s;uch a one being &s;poken of as falling &s;hort of Life and Happine&s;s, by turn|ing away from that Righteou&s;ne&s;s which he once had, when otherwi&s;e he might and &s;hould have lived. Compare this Place with <HI>Ezek.</HI> 3.20. and 33.18. The Righteous intended in the&s;e Places are, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;uch as are mentioned in 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.20, 21. and there &s;aid to <HI>have e&s;caped the Pollutions of the World, thro' the Knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and to <HI>have known the Way of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> but to <HI>turn again from the holy Commandment.</HI> That &s;uch righteous Per&s;ons as the&s;e &s;hall be &s;aved, if they per&s;evere in &s;uch Faith and O|bedience
<PB N="126" REF="005439_0141_101831c784098dd8">
as they have attained to, is what I here endeavour to main|tain: Not that any can be &s;aved without Regeneration; for Man's Regeneration is his Salvation, <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.5. But my Meaning is, that &s;uch as &s;o believe and obey, &s;hall obtain both Ju&s;tification and Regene|tion, if they per&s;evere in &s;o doing: Otherwi&s;e, &s;uch as per&s;evere &s;hould not be &s;aved, according to the mentioned Promi&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider the &s;econd Sort of Promi&s;es inten|ded to be in&s;i&s;ted on in this Argument, <HI>viz.</HI> Tho&s;e wherein &s;pecial Mercies are engaged to &s;uch as <HI>overcome</HI>; and in which I &s;uppo&s;e the Grace of Regeneration to be conditionally promi&s;ed. I &s;hall at pre|&s;ent only in&s;i&s;t on two Places, in which, I &s;uppo&s;e, we have &s;uch Pro|mi&s;es. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is in Rev. 2.17. <HI>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden Manna, and will give him a white Stone, and in this Stone a new Name written, which no Man knoweth, &s;aving he that receiveth it.</HI> The &s;econd Place I intend, is in Rev. 3.12. <HI>Him that overcometh will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God; and he &s;hall go no more out. And I will write upon him the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God, which is the new Jeru&s;alem, which cometh down out of Heaven from my God; and I will write upon him my new Name.</HI> With Re&s;pect to the&s;e Places we may con&s;ider, (1) The Subjects unto whom the&s;e Promi&s;es are made. (2) The Promi&s;es made unto the&s;e Subjects, and that by Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who&s;e Words the&s;e are.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then, the Subjects unto whom the&s;e Promi&s;es are made are &s;uch as <HI>overcome.</HI> For <HI>to him that overcometh,</HI> &amp;c. which Words being &s;poken <HI>indifinitely,</HI> mu&s;t be under&s;tood of all that overcome, whoever they be. But the Objects over whom the Victory intended is &s;up|po&s;ed to be obtained, is not here expre&s;&s;ed, but mu&s;t be under&s;tood from what is &s;aid in Scripture, with Re&s;pect to that Warfare, wherein Chri&s;tians are engaged again&s;t <HI>the Fle&s;h, the World,</HI> and <HI>the Devil,</HI> as in 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.12. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.10,&mdash;17. <HI>Jam.</HI> 4.7. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.11. and many other Places. From whence we may gather, that the Victory intended, is over all the Enemies of our Souls. The&s;e are the Things which we mu&s;t overcome, if we would have the Benefits promi&s;ed in the Words before us.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t con&s;ider when or how the&s;e Things may be &s;aid to be overcome. Now, here it is very nece&s;&s;ary that we ob&s;erve, that there are two Periods, in which, or remarkable Degrees of Victory, with Re&s;pect whereunto, Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion may be &s;aid to overcome
<PB N="127" REF="005439_0142_10183219e6e69670">
their &s;piritual Enemies, or to gain the Victory over them. One of the&s;e is when they are fir&s;t &s;avingly united unto Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;o intitled thro' his Merits, to the everla&s;ting Mercies offered in the Go&s;|pel. The other is when they are actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the Good which Je&s;us Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed for them; and which God hath from Eternity purpo&s;ed to be&s;tow; and are al&s;o perfectly freed from all the Evils which their Sin and Fall had brought on them. Now of the&s;e two remarkable Sea&s;ons and Degrees of the Chri&s;tian's Victory, it will be to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e to &s;ay &s;omething, e&s;pecially of the fir&s;t of them; becau&s;e they ought here to be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion may be &s;aid to overcome Sin, the World, and the Devil, even all the Enemies of Souls, when by Faith they obtain an Intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;o are united to him, and thro' Grace entitled to all the &s;ure and everla&s;ting Mercies of the new Covenant, offered to &s;inful Men in the Go&s;pel. Whenever any of the &s;inful Children of Men are thus intere&s;ted in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their Sins are all pardoned, and their Per&s;ons ju&s;tified, by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t imputed to them. They are reconciled unto God, adopted into the Number of his Children, being regenerated by his Spirit, and &s;o made new Creatures; And their future Happine&s;s is as fully &s;ecured to them, whether they know it or not, as if they were actually in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Glory of the World to come: So that now their State is that expre&s;&s;ed, John 5.24. <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, he that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that &s;ent me, hath everla&s;ting Life; and &s;hall not come into Condemnation, but is pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life.</HI> And Rom. 8.1, 2. <HI>There is therefore now no Condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk not after the Fle&s;h, but after the Spirit. For the Law of the Spirit in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death.</HI> With the&s;e Places do many others a|gree, &s;ome of which I &s;hall only here refer to, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.32,&mdash;39. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.14. 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.9. <HI>John</HI> 3.29. 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.28. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 32.12. <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.7, 8. <HI>John</HI> 10.27, 29. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.3,&mdash;5.</P>
<P>When eternal Happine&s;s is thus &s;ecured to any of the Children of Men, they may be well &s;aid to have overcome; (tho' they are not pa&s;t having any new A&s;&s;ault made on them by their &s;piritual Enemies, and &s;uffering greatly by them) &s;o that it may be &s;aid to every true Saint, as in 1 John 2.13. <HI>Ye have overcome the wicked one.</HI> There|fore holy <HI>Paul,</HI> being ju&s;tified by Faith in Chri&s;t, could &s;ay, as in 2 Tim. 4.7, 8. <HI>I have fought the good Fight, I have fini&s;hed my Cour&s;e, I have kept the Faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of
<PB N="128" REF="005439_0143_101831ca445cbad0">
Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord the righteous Judge &s;hall give me at that Day; and not to me only, but unto all them al&s;o that love his Appearing.</HI> Note here, that the&s;e Words of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>I have kept the Faith,</HI> cannot mean that he had per&s;evered to the End of his Life; but that he had done &s;o, till he had &s;ecured his future and eternal Happine&s;s, as in the fore-mentioned <HI>John</HI> 5.24. And &s;uch a Victory has every godly Man obtained over the Enemies of his Soul, tho' many &s;uch are not, as <HI>Paul,</HI> a&s;&s;ured of this.</P>
<P>But there is yet, <HI>Secondly,</HI> a further Victory to be &s;ought and ob|tained by Chri&s;tians, over their &s;piritual Enemies, and all Things that hinder their compleat Happine&s;s, even over all the Evils that trouble and mole&s;t them: For which Victory they mu&s;t wait patiently, 'till their &s;piritual Warfare be fully accompli&s;hed, which it will not be while they live in this World: Nay, their la&s;t Enemy will not be de|&s;troyed, 'till their Re&s;urrection from the Dead, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.26. Now the Chri&s;tian's Progre&s;s towards this compleat Victory is but gradual after the fir&s;t Victory mentioned is obtained, and will be perfect when the good Day arrives, wherein they &s;hall behold God's Face in Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and all their Tears &s;hall be wiped away.</P>
<P>If it be now inquired which of the&s;e Victories thus de&s;cribed, is that intended and refered to in the Places under Con&s;ideration, as that which qualifies the Subjects that obtain it, for the Benefits pro|mi&s;ed to &s;uch as overcome; unto this I an&s;wer, That the fir&s;t of the&s;e two Victories de&s;cribed mu&s;t needs be that intended in the Places here di&s;cour&s;ed on; becau&s;e the Promi&s;es in them made to &s;uch as are Victorious, are of Things belonging, according to the Tenor of the new Covenant, to &s;uch as overcome, in the fir&s;t Sen&s;e explained.</P>
<P>This will be evident if we con&s;ider what the Benefits are, here promi&s;ed to victorious Chri&s;tians. And in the fir&s;t of the&s;e Places men|tioned, (<HI>viz. Rev.</HI> 2.17.) the Things by our Saviour promi&s;ed to be given to &s;uch, are the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> (1) He will give &s;uch an one to eat of the <HI>hidden Manna.</HI> (2) He will give him a <HI>white Stone.</HI> (3) In that Stone, <HI>a new Name written, which no Man knoweth, &s;aving him that receiveth it.</HI></P>
<P>In the other Place in&s;i&s;ted on, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.12. the Things promi&s;ed to the Victorious are the&s;e following, <HI>viz.</HI> Fir&s;t, <HI>I will,</HI> &s;aith our Sa|viour, <HI>make him a Pillar in the Temple of my God; and he &s;hall go no more out.</HI> Secondly, <HI>I will,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>write upon him the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God, which is the new Jeru&s;alem, which cometh down out of Heaven from my God: And I will write upon him my new Name.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="005439_0144_101832201e242408">Now can it be imagined by any one who duly con&s;iders what is intended in the&s;e Promi&s;es, that the Subjects unto whom they are made, are &s;uch as have obtained a full Victory over all their &s;piritual Enemies, &s;o as no more to be di&s;turbed by them? Nay, is it not evident, that the Benefits in the&s;e Promi&s;es engaged, are actually given and granted to all &s;uch as are victorious in the fir&s;t Sen&s;e ex|plained? Tho' it be true, that they are &s;till in a militant State, fighting under the Banner of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Captain of their Salva|tion, yet their final Victory is fully &s;ecured. Is it not evident that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the <HI>hidden Manna</HI> intended in the mentioned <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.17? And is it not equally clear, that all true Believers do now feed on that Bread of Life? as our Saviour &s;heweth in <HI>John</HI> 6.48,&mdash;58. Is it not evident that the <HI>white Stone</HI> promi&s;ed, is given to every rege|nerate and ju&s;tified Soul? Is not every true Saint favoured with this precious Gift? Is not the <HI>white Stone</HI> here intended, the &s;ame Thing that is el&s;ewhere called <HI>a new and clean Heart, the Seed of God, the di|vine Nature, the Image of God,</HI> &amp;c.? And is not this an infallible Sign and Token of the Ju&s;tification of the Per&s;on it is given to? Even as the white Stones which were of old given in Courts of Ju&s;tice, to &s;uch as were cleared or judged innocent, were given as a Sign of their Ju&s;tification.
<Q>They, &s;aith <HI>Pareus</HI> on this Place, come neare&s;t the literal Meaning, who think that Chri&s;t in this re&s;pecteth the Manner of Judgment, where there were two Sorts of Stones ca&s;t into a Ba&s;on; by the <HI>White</HI> the Innocent were ab&s;olved; by the <HI>Black</HI> the Guilty were condemned.</Q>
So that, according to <HI>Pareus,</HI> the giving of a white Stone &s;ignified that the Per&s;on was ju&s;tified to whom it was given, tho' he has not yet obtained a perfect Victory over Sin and Satan. It is al&s;o true that a <HI>new Name</HI> written in the white Stone here mentioned, is given in and with it, and by every true Believer received. This is that Name which God has promi&s;ed to &s;uch as <HI>keep his Sabbaths,</HI> and <HI>choo&s;e the Things that plea&s;e him,</HI> and <HI>take hold of his Covenant,</HI> I&s;ai. 56.4, 5. <HI>Even unto them,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>will I give in mine Hou&s;e, and within my Walls, a Place and a Name bet|ter than that of Sons and Daughters. I will give them an everla&s;ting Name that &s;hall not be cut off.</HI> The &s;ame Name is intended in 1 John 3.1. <HI>Behold, what Manner of Love the Father hath be&s;towed upon us, that we &s;hould be called the</HI> SONS OF GOD. Nor is this a Name only, but both the Name and what is &s;ignified by it, as by the next Words appeareth. <HI>Beloved, now are we the Sons of God,</HI> &amp;c. with which compare 2 Cor. 6.17, 18. <HI>I will be a Father unto you, and ye &s;hall be my Sons and Daughters, &s;aith the Lord almighty.</HI> This is a Privi|lege belonging to every true Saint.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="005439_0145_101831cc2f151da8">The &s;ame may be &s;aid with Re&s;pect to the Privileges or Benefits promi&s;ed in the other Place mentioned, Rev. 3.12. Every &s;uch an one is <HI>made a Pillar in the Temple of God, that &s;hall go no more out,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But for the further clearing up of this Point, it mu&s;t be here ob&s;er|ved, That we mu&s;t carefully di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the Victory Men may be &s;aid to obtain over Sin and Satan, in they Way of their own Duty, while they are called to &s;trive again&s;t them, in a Cour&s;e of Well-doing, and that which they obtain by what God him&s;elf does for them, when they have &s;o far overcome, thro' his Grace a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, as to have done what is required <HI>on their Part,</HI> in order to God's doing for them what is nece&s;&s;ary <HI>on his,</HI> for the perfecting of that Victory, which is de&s;ired and endeavoured after.</P>
<P>Now, Man may be &s;aid, on his Part, to overcome and be victori|ous, when he has thro' Grace &s;o far prevailed, as to have come up to the Terms of the Covenant, wherein everla&s;ting Mercies are offered and conditionally promi&s;ed to him: And yet his Victory cannot be &s;aid to be compleated, (taking in God's Part of the Work) till God has al&s;o performed the Promi&s;e made to Man, on Condition of his doing what on his Part is required. Thus di&s;tingui&s;hing, we may truly affirm, that Man mu&s;t fir&s;t overcome &s;o far as is required of him, before he may expect that God will perfect his Victory, by doing what he hath conditionally promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>And thus it may be affirmed, that a Sinner mu&s;t him&s;elf fir&s;t over|come, before God will <HI>give him to eat of the hidden Manna; give him a white Stone, with a new Name written in it; make him a Pillar in the Temple of God, that &s;hall go no more out; write on him the Name of God,</HI> &amp;c. All which denote God's granting his &s;aving and &s;pe|cial Mercies to him, as I have &s;hewed above; but all &s;uch Mercies are given in the Way of a Covenant, the Condition of which mu&s;t be complied with, before a Sinner can, in that Way, obtain them: Nor does our coming up to the Terms of the Covenant &s;uppo&s;e or imply our having any &s;uch Mercy before we &s;o do. I intend &s;uch Mercies as Regeneration and Ju&s;tification are. And yet I &s;hall not doubt to affirm that no Sinner ever complied with the Terms of the new Covenant, without having the di&s;tingui&s;hing Grace of God magnified towards him; and this I hope I &s;hall make mani|fe&s;t before I have done.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. That Sinners do therefore peri&s;h, becau&s;e they receive not the Love of the Truth, that they may be &s;aved, an Argument that they have an Offer of true Holine&s;s made to them.</HEAD>
<P>_I GROUND the Argument propo&s;ed in the Title of this Chapter, on the Text alluded to in it, <HI>viz.</HI> 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 2.10. where the Apo&s;tle &s;peaking of <HI>them that peri&s;h,</HI> under the antichri&s;tian Apo&s;tacy, de|clares that they therefore peri&s;h, <HI>becau&s;e they re|ceive not the Love of the Truth, that they might be &s;a|ved.</HI> Now I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew how the&s;e Words &s;erve to my Purpo&s;e, by con&s;idering (1) What we may un|der&s;tand by their <HI>peri&s;hing,</HI> who fail of the <HI>Salvation</HI> mentioned in the Text. And (2) The Rea&s;on given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir peri&s;hing as they do. (3) The Inference that I draw from hence, <HI>viz.</HI> That this &s;hews, that they have an Offer of a Principle of true Grace or Holine&s;s made to them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then, I will con&s;ider what is meant by their <HI>peri&s;hing,</HI> who <HI>recieve not the Love of the Truth, that they might be &s;aved.</HI> Now this may be the better under&s;tood, if we con&s;ider what that <HI>Salvation</HI> is, which is oppo&s;ed thereunto: For there is no Doubt but that the Perdition of tho&s;e that peri&s;h, and the Salvation of tho&s;e that peri&s;h not, but have everla&s;ting Life, are &s;o naturally oppo&s;ed one to the other, as to in&s;truct us in the Nature of each of them, if we compare them together.</P>
<P>Now by <HI>Salvation</HI> we are not here to under&s;tand that Happine&s;s only, which tho&s;e that &s;hall attain to it, &s;hall enjoy in the World to come; but it does compri&s;e in it al&s;o the <HI>preparing</HI> &s;uch <HI>Ve&s;&s;els of Mercy</HI> for the Enjoyment of that <HI>Glory</HI> which is intended for them: And thus this Salvation does include in it, Men's being <HI>&s;aved from their Sins,</HI> as
<PB N="132" REF="005439_0147_101831cf8acefba8">
in <HI>Matth.</HI> 1.21. <HI>i. e.</HI> not only the Pardon of them, but al&s;o their Regeneration and Sanctification. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.25, 26. But I need not here enlarge on this Particular, having at large con&s;idered what is meant by the Salvation of Sinners, in Part I. Chap. II. to which Place I refer my Reader.</P>
<P>But now, if we under&s;tand this of &s;uch peri&s;hing of Sinners as is fitly oppo&s;ed to the Salvation of tho&s;e that believe, we &s;hall find it to comprehend much more in it, than the Pain and Torment endured by the Wicked in <HI>another World, viz.</HI> Their being &s;uffered to remain under the Guilt and Power of Sin, in <HI>This</HI>; and &s;o to <HI>pine away in their Iniquities,</HI> and <HI>die in their Sins,</HI> without Repentance, and without a Pardon, in a State of Condemnation, and having the Wrath of God abiding on them; the Ca&s;e of all &s;uch as fall &s;hort of the Salvation of God; as is in the holy Scriptures abundantly declared. I &s;hall only refer to &s;ome of the Places declaring &s;o much. Tho&s;e who plea&s;e, may read and compare &s;uch as the&s;e, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33, 10. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 22.14. <HI>John</HI> 8.21, 24. and Chap. 3.36. The Unregenerate and Un|ju&s;tified are <HI>dead in Sin</HI>: And to remain in that State is to peri&s;h, as well as to be puni&s;hed for Sin in the Life to come.</P>
<P N="2">2. I proceed to con&s;ider the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> why &s;uch <HI>peri&s;h,</HI> as do &s;o. Now this is fully and plainly expre&s;&s;ed in the Place under Con&s;idera|tion: And they therefore peri&s;h <HI>becau&s;e they receive not the Love of the Truth, that they may be &s;aved.</HI> Now, to clear up this, we may con|&s;ider, (1) What is here intended by the <HI>Truth.</HI> (2) What is meant by the <HI>Love</HI> of it. (3) What we may under&s;tand by Per&s;ons <HI>receiving</HI> this Love. (4) That Sinners <HI>might be &s;aved</HI> if they would do this. (5) That they peri&s;h <HI>becau&s;e</HI> they refu&s;e thus to do.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us <HI>fir&s;t</HI> con&s;ider what is here meant by the <HI>Truth.</HI> Now, tho' the Word <HI>Truth,</HI> has many Acceptations in Scripture; yet there is no Doubt but that by the Word <HI>Truth</HI> we may here under&s;tand all the divine Truth which God has revealed and made known unto Man, in order to his Duty and Happine&s;s, both by his Works and by his Word; e&s;pecially in the Go&s;pel of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t: This great Truth comprehendeth in it, all tho&s;e excellent and glorious Truths, which are nece&s;&s;ary for Mankind to under&s;tand and believe, in order to their Well-being; e&s;pecially tho&s;e that relate to the Way of Man's Redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and Regeneration by the holy Spirit. This Collection of &s;acred Truths, is emphatically called <HI>the Truth,</HI> in 2 The&s;. 2.13. &mdash;<HI>God hath from the Beginning cho&s;en you to Salva|tion,
<PB N="133" REF="005439_0148_10183224572dda68">
thro' Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the</HI> TRUTH. Thus the &s;ame is al&s;o called, in <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.1. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.25. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.2. and 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 2.1. with many other Places which I need not tran|&s;cribe.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>next</HI> Thing we have to con&s;ider, is, what we may under|&s;tand by the <HI>Love of the Truth.</HI> Now, to this I &s;ay, That this Love is &s;uch an Approbation and Acquie&s;cence of the Heart in it, as is &s;uitable to the Nature and Excellency of the Things &s;uppo&s;ed to be loved. This &s;uppo&s;eth an A&s;&s;ent of the Under&s;tanding to it, as being what it is; and in that Re&s;pect good, which no Fal&s;hood is. But a Soul that loves the Truth here intended, does not &s;tay here, but ap|proves of it, and takes Satisfaction in it, as it is divine, proceeding from God, and being worthy of him: And in Re&s;pect of the Things revealed by it, exceeding excellent; and nece&s;&s;ary to be known by the Children of Men: And on the&s;e Accounts he takes Plea&s;ure in it.</P>
<P>A Soul thus loving the Truth, &s;avoureth the Things of God, as truly excellent and glorious. He can &s;ay from the Bottom of his Heart, as in 2 Kings 20.19. <HI>Good is the Word of the Lord</HI>; and as in Rom. 7.22. <HI>I delight in the Law of the Lord after the inward Man</HI>; and as in P&s;al. 119.140. <HI>Thy Law is very pure; therefore thy Ser|vant loveth it.</HI> The Precepts, Promi&s;es, and Threatnings of God's Word are all e&s;teemed by him, as in P&s;al. 119.128. <HI>I e&s;teem all thy Precepts concerning all Things to be right; and I hate every fal&s;e Way.</HI> A Lover of the Truth is a good and holy Man. He that has the Love of the Truth in his Heart, has the Love and Fear of God al&s;o in it. In a Word, &s;uch an One has a Principle of true Holine&s;s in his Soul. He has the <HI>Seed of God</HI> in him, as in 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.9. He has been <HI>made Partaker of the divine Nature,</HI> as in 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.4.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>third</HI> Thing to be con&s;idered, is, what it is to <HI>receive</HI> the Love de&s;cribed; and &s;o what it is <HI>not to receive</HI> it. Now, to this I &s;ay, That this mu&s;t needs be done by &s;ome Act or Acts of the Per|&s;on &s;aid to do it; which are required, in order to his having of it, and which it is Man's Duty to perform. It cannot intend only his being made Partaker of it, without doing any Thing in order to it. This does from hence appear to be a Truth, That Men's not receiving the Love of the Truth, is in the Text &s;poken of as the Sin and Crime for which &s;uch Offenders eternally peri&s;h. Now, if &s;omething were not required of Sinners, in order to their being made Partaker; of it, it could not be charged on them as their Crime, tho' it might be their great Misfortune (if I may be allowed to u&s;e that Word) that they par|take

not of it. God's not be&s;towing the Love of the Truth on any Sinner, would not be the Sinner's Fault, if nothing were required of him in orde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> theret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. When not receiving the Love of the Truth, is &s;poken of as the Sin and Crime of tho&s;e who have it not, this plainly implies, that &s;uch as have this Love, have it in the Way of a Gift from another, even from God him&s;elf, unto which their Act of receiving or ac|cepting it is nece&s;&s;ary. It is not &s;aid that Sinners peri&s;h for not lov|ing the Truth; but for not receiving that Love: By which we are taught, that it is the Gift of God; ina&s;much as it is to be received from him; and that Sinners have a conditional Offer of it made to them; as will by and by more fully appear.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>fourth</HI> Thing in Order, is, to &s;hew that Sinners <HI>might be &s;aved,</HI> if they would <HI>receive the Love</HI> &s;poken of. By the Text we are a&s;&s;ured, that tho&s;e who peri&s;h, do &s;o, becau&s;e they receive not this Love, that they might be &s;aved. In which Words it is plainly inti|mated, that they might and &s;hould be &s;aved, did not their Refu&s;al of the Love of the Truth, hinder it: And it accordingly followeth in Ver&s;e 11, 12. That for this Cau&s;e God &s;ends &s;ome <HI>&s;trong Delu&s;ion, that they &s;hould believe a Lie: That they all might be damned, who believed not the Truth, but had Plea&s;ure in Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> In the&s;e Words, what is called <HI>peri&s;hing,</HI> and oppo&s;ed to Men's being &s;aved, is &s;ignified their being given up to &s;uch Unbelief and Hardne&s;s of Heart, as will end in their eternal Torment.</P>
<P N="5">5. And <HI>fifthly,</HI> it followeth, (as is above &s;uppo&s;ed) that the Rea&s;on why Men peri&s;h, under the Go&s;pel, is becau&s;e they receive not the Love of the Truth. If they would accept of that precious Gift, they &s;hould not <HI>peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Life.</HI> Nothing can be more evident than this, in the Place under Con&s;ideration. The main Scope and De&s;ign of the Place is to a&s;&s;ert this Truth: Which Truth having now cleared up, I &s;hall</P>
<P N="3">3. Proceed, to clear up the Con&s;equence which I draw from the Premi&s;es: Namely, That it from hence followeth, that a Principle of true Grace or Holine&s;s is offered to Sinners in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>It is evident that &s;uch a Principle of Holine&s;s is plainly implied in <HI>the Love of the Truth,</HI> of which I have been &s;peaking: And it is al&s;o manife&s;t, that Men's not receiving (<HI>i. e.</HI> refu&s;ing, or not accepting) of this divine Principle, plainly &s;uppo&s;eth their having, in the Go&s;pel, an Offer of it made to them; for how is it po&s;&s;ible, that Per&s;ons &s;hould be guilty of a heinous Sin, in not receiving from the Hand of
<PB N="135" REF="005439_0150_1018328097809de8">
Another, a Benefit which they never had any Offer of? And how &s;hould their Refu&s;al of &s;uch a Mercy be the Cau&s;e of their eternal Ruin? If he who alone had the Di&s;po&s;al of it, never declared his Willingne&s;s to confer the &s;ame upon them, on any Terms what&s;o|ever; or never propo&s;ed any Condition on which the &s;ame might be obtained; or never &s;aid to Per&s;ons de&s;titute of it, as in Rev. 3.18. <HI>I coun&s;el thee to buy of me Gold tried in the Fire, that thou may&s;t be rich; and white Raiment, that thou may&s;t be cloathed, and that the Shame of thy Nakedne&s;s do not appear; and anoint thine Eyes with Eye-Salve, that thou may&s;t &s;ee.</HI> Which <HI>Gold, &amp;c.</HI> here &s;poken of, certainly compri|&s;eth a Principle of true Holine&s;s in it; and albeit it cannot be pro|perly purcha&s;ed by any Sinner, yet it may, on &s;ome Terms or other, be attained: And le&s;s than this, I think, cannot be implied in the Words.</P>
<P>Now, if I am a&s;ked what the Terms are, on which this ine&s;timable Benefit may be acquired, I need here only &s;ay, that they are the &s;ame which I have, in this E&s;&s;ay, more than once declared to be the Condition of the new Covenant, or Covenant of Grace; more e&s;pe|cially this is done in this &s;econd Part, Chap. III. whereunto, for the avoiding of Prolixity, I &s;hall here only refer my Reader.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. The Doctrine pleaded for, in this Part of my E&s;&s;ay, very con&s;i&s;tent with that of Men's utter Inability, while in a State of Na|ture, to perform any truly holy Action what&s;oever.</HEAD>
<P>_MY De&s;ign in the following Chapters of this &s;econd Part of my E&s;&s;ay, is, to an&s;wer &s;everal Objections which are apt to be made again&s;t the Truth, which I have thus far by Scripture and Rea&s;on endeavoured to confirm; and I &s;hall not willingly omit &s;uch as I think have mo&s;t Appearance of Weight in them. In this pre&s;ent Chapter I &s;hall con&s;ider that which, with &s;ome Appearance of Rea&s;on, may be objected from the Accounts
<PB N="136" REF="005439_0151_1018322b51228150">
we have in Scripture, of the Corruption of Man's Nature &s;ince the Fall; and his Impotence thence ari&s;ing, with Re&s;pect to Things &s;pi|ritual, and truly holy, from whence his Inability, by Nature, to com|ply with the Terms of the new Covenant, is, with a very con&s;idera|ble Shew of Rea&s;on and Piety, by many, endeavoured to be manife&s;ted; whether with any good Succe&s;s, and real Strength, with Re&s;pect to my Hypothe&s;is, I &s;hall now endeavour to weigh in the Ballance of the Sanctuary.</P>
<P>But let us a little con&s;ider what may be truly &s;aid, with Re&s;pect to Man's Impotence while he is in a State of Nature: And here, I readily acknowledge, that while he is in that State, he has no Power to perform any Action what&s;oever, in a gracious and holy Manner. I con&s;tantly affirm, that unto the Performance of an Action as is ex|pre&s;&s;ed, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the Per&s;on performing it, be fir&s;t endowed with a Principle of true Grace and Holine&s;s, from which &s;uch an Action may &s;pring or flow. The Tree mu&s;t be good, be|fore the Fruit can be &s;o, <HI>Luke</HI> 6.43, 44, 45.</P>
<P>Men in a natural or unregenerate State, may, indeed, perform Actions that are materially good, or in Re&s;pect of the general Nature and Kind of them, and &s;o &s;uch Actions as God has commanded them to perform; but they cannot perform them in &s;uch a Manner, as will denominate them, in a &s;trict Sen&s;e, good and holy.</P>
<P>And it mu&s;t al&s;o be acknowledged, that Mankind are, by Rea&s;on of the Corruption of their Nature, &s;o <HI>bent</HI> and inclined to do that which is evil, and &s;o <HI>di&s;inclined</HI> and backward to do well, that it is not ea&s;y for them to do tho&s;e Things that are materially good, and to forbear the contrary to them; tho' this be not wholly above their Power; for they frequently, while in a State of Nature, do the Good and ab|&s;tain from the Bad. I think that in the&s;e Things I agree with the Generality of tho&s;e who are Pious and Orthodox.</P>
<P>And from what I have now &s;aid, I infer, that the Difference be|twixt me and tho&s;e who mi&s;like my Hypothe&s;is, does not lie in this, that I exalt the Power of Men in their natural State, more than they do; but in this rather, that I exalt the Grace of God more: For whereas they affirm, that the Faith and Repentance which God re|quires as the Condition of the Covenant of Grace, is &s;uch as none can exerci&s;e 'till they are become good and holy Per&s;ons, being born of the Spirit, and become new Creatures; I on the contrary endeavour to maintain, that the Faith and Repentance, by God required as the Condition of the new Covenant, is of a lower Kind than tho&s;e who
<PB N="137" REF="005439_0152_101832831f3ac040">
oppo&s;e me will allow of; and &s;uppo&s;e it to be &s;uch as Men, by di|vine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, can perform, before they are &s;avingly renewed by the Spirit, and &s;o become true Saints, as all that are <HI>born of God</HI> are, and &s;o <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life,</HI> as in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.17. and <HI>John</HI> 5.24. does appear. I really think that God, in the Covenant of Grace, does not in&s;i&s;t on &s;uch Terms, as my Oppo&s;ers imagine, and which can never be complied with by any Sinner, while he is in his mi&s;erable and undone E&s;tate; but then only, when he has got into a State of Safety, and has already obtained eternal Life.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e therefore who would convince me of a Mi&s;take in this Affair, &s;hould an&s;wer my Arguments, by which I endeavour to prove, That
<Q>neither Regeneration, nor any Action implied in it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered to Sinners in the Go&s;pel.</Q>
Part II. Chap. V. And they &s;hould al&s;o &s;hew, if they can, that &s;uch Faith and Repentance, as I hold to be the Condition of the new Cove|nant, neither is, nor can be &s;o, by a Confutation of what I have &s;aid, Part II. Chap. III. and el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>But it may be here &s;aid, That by my own Confe&s;&s;ion, Sinners are required to <HI>come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for Life,</HI> on Pain of eternal Damnati|on; which Coming mu&s;t needs be included in the Condition of the new Covenant, and is &s;o, as appears in <HI>John</HI> 6.35, 37. <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.28. And yet the Coming intended, cannot be in the Power of any Per&s;on, while in a State of Nature; for our Saviour him&s;elf tells us, in the &s;aid 6th Chapter of <HI>John,</HI> Ver&s;e 44. That <HI>no Man can come to him, except the Father which hath &s;ent him, draw him:</HI> And in Ver&s;e 65. he &s;ays, <HI>No Man can come unto me, except it were given him of my Father.</HI></P>
<P>Now, to this Objection, I an&s;wer, (1) By acknowledging that Coming to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for Life, belongs to the Condition of the new Covenant, or rather, is the Condition intended, or Thing required, in order to the Salvation of &s;inful Men. (2) By affirming that Per&s;ons in an unregenerate State, may have Power to come to Chri&s;t for eter|nal Life. The la&s;t of the&s;e only needs to be con&s;idered: And the Que&s;tion here is not whether any Man can come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, ex|cept the Father draw him and incline his Heart to come; which mu&s;t be denied; but what that Drawing is, which is intended in the Words under Con&s;ideration; and whether none but tho&s;e that do come to Chri&s;t, have the Drawing intended.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="005439_0153_1018322ce3fe1c80">Tho&s;e who oppo&s;e my Hypothe&s;is, &s;uppo&s;e that that divine <HI>Draw|ing</HI> which our Saviour &s;peaks of, con&s;i&s;ts in that powerful Influence of God on the Souls of Men, whereby there is a &s;aving Change wrought in them, in Re&s;pect whereof they are &s;aid to be born of the Spirit; and con&s;equently that &s;uch as have not &s;uch a Change wro't in them, have no Power to come to Chri&s;t. But at pre&s;ent I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to believe, that the <HI>Drawing</HI> intended by our Lord, means the efficacious, and indeed, irre&s;i&s;table Influence of the holy Spirit, in the great Work of Regeneration. I will offer &s;ome Rea&s;ons why I think this not to be intended in the Places quoted.</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t Rea&s;on which I &s;hall name is, Becau&s;e when Sinners are invited to come to Chri&s;t for Life, one Thing intended in the Life which they are to go to Chri&s;t for, is the Grace of Regeneration, or that Principle of &s;piritual Life which we lo&s;t by the Fall, and which in the Work of Regeneration is re&s;tored: Or is it not true that Sin|ners are called to go to Chri&s;t for this, which is one of the principal Benefits which he purcha&s;ed for his People, yea even for the very fir&s;t Beginnings of this &s;piritual Life? I hope none will dare to deny this.</P>
<P>Now, if Sinners are invited to go to Chri&s;t for this Principle of Life, or Grace, how can it be po&s;&s;ibly imagined that their fir&s;t having it is nece&s;&s;ary in order to their doing it? For mu&s;t they fir&s;t have the Life they &s;hould go to Chri&s;t for, before it is po&s;&s;ible for them to go to him for it? I cannot yet under&s;tand this!</P>
<P>My &s;econd Rea&s;on is this: The Expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed in the Words un|der Con&s;ideration, &s;eems not well to agree with the Work intended, if by <HI>Drawing,</HI> the Work of Regeneration be meant. The Work of Regeneration is wro't by the immediate Operation of the Spirit; and it is, according to the Language of Scripture, a <HI>creating Work, P&s;al.</HI> 51.10. <HI>Col.</HI> 3.10. And it is compared to that mighty Act of God's Power, by which Je&s;us Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed from the Dead, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.19, 20. It is al&s;o called the giving a <HI>new Heart</HI> and a <HI>new Spirit, Ezek.</HI> 11.19. and 36.26. Now this Work &s;eems not to be well expre&s;&s;ed by the Word <HI>Drawing,</HI> which &s;uits better to Per&s;ons being per&s;uaded in a moral Way, than their having a &s;upernatural Work wro't in them by infinite Power. I confe&s;s the Word <HI>Drawing,</HI> may be u&s;ed in a phy&s;ical Sen&s;e, but then I think it is not with Application to moral or rational Agents, as &s;uch, as in the Ca&s;e under Con&s;idera|tion, which concerns Men's being drawn to their Duty, in a Way, no Doubt, agreable to their Natures. To draw a free Agent into Action, is, in a rational Way, to excite him to it; and it is &s;uch Drawing that
<PB N="139" REF="005439_0154_10183284f0d678d0">
Men need in order to their coming to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;us for his &s;aving Benefits, whether it be before their Regeneration, or after it: And when they are effectually drawn in this Way, it is <HI>given to them to come to Chri&s;t,</HI> as in one of the Places quoted, <HI>viz. John</HI> 6.65.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here add, <HI>thirdly,</HI> That this Word <HI>Draw,</HI> and other Words like it, are u&s;ed in Scripture, in the &s;ame Sen&s;e I plead for, <HI>i. e.</HI> to per&s;uade Per&s;ons to what is their Duty and Intere&s;t, in a moral or ra|tional Way: Yea, whether this Cour&s;e have Succe&s;s or not, Per&s;ons may be &s;aid to be drawn, led, or per&s;uaded, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See Ho&s;ea 11.4. <HI>I drew them with Cords of a Man, with Bands of Love, and I was to them as they that take off the Yoke on their Jaws, and I laid Meat unto them.</HI> Rom. 2.4. <HI>The Goodne&s;s of God leadeth thee unto Repentance.</HI> 2 Cor. 4.11. <HI>Knowing the Terror of the Lord, we per&s;wade Men.</HI> Acts 26.28. <HI>Almo&s;t thou per&s;wade&s;t me to be a Chri&s;tian. Agrippa</HI> was per&s;uaded, tho' not prevailed with. Per&s;ons may be thus drawn and per&s;uaded to go to Chri&s;t, who yet never go to him. When our Saviour &s;aid, in John 12.32. <HI>And I, when I am lifted up, will draw all Men unto me,</HI> did not mean, I believe, that he would draw all Men effectually of whom he &s;pake. Some he intended &s;o to draw as to leave them inexcu&s;able. See John 15.22. <HI>If I had not come and &s;po|ken unto them, they had not had Sin: But now they have no Cloak for their Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' it be granted that <HI>no Man can come to the Son, except the Father draw him</HI>: Yet I do not acknowledge, that no Man has Power to come to the Son, except he be drawn effectually, &s;o as actually to come to him; much le&s;s, except he be drawn irre&s;i&s;tably, &s;o that he cannot but come to him: This is more than to &s;ay that a Man cannot come to the Son, except the Father draw him. Tho' without drawing, Men cannot come; yet many are drawn who never com&eacute;. See Matth. 23.37. <HI>O</HI> Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, <HI>thou that kille&s;t the Prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them that are &s;ent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings; and ye would not.</HI></P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be objected again&s;t what I have here &s;aid, That &s;uch a Drawing of Per&s;ons as I have been de&s;cribing, can give no Power to come to Chri&s;t. Drawing in a Way of moral Sua&s;ion does not give the Per&s;ons drawn any Power which they had not before; tho' it may excite to the Exerci&s;e of Powers they before had.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="005439_0155_1018323293f80f80">To this Objection I an&s;wer, That Per&s;ons may be &s;aid to be un|able to do this, that, or the other Thing, either in a more proper Sen&s;e, when they have no Power latent in them, capable of being &s;o excited and &s;tirred up by proper Means and Motives, &s;uitable for the awakening and exciting &s;uch a Power, as In&s;tructions, Exhortations, Promi&s;es and Threatnings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or le&s;s properly, for &s;uch an utter Indi&s;po&s;ition to Things propo&s;ed to be done, as renders a Per&s;on actually uncapable of doing them, without &s;ome Means u&s;ed with him, for removing the Indi&s;po&s;ition unto which he is &s;ubject. Now I &s;uppo&s;e Men's Inability to come to Chri&s;t, is of the Kind or Sort fir&s;t named. It con&s;i&s;ts in the Aver&s;ion of their Wills to the Duty propo&s;ed to them, and ari&s;es from &s;everal Cau&s;es, &s;uch as inherent Corruption, Ignorance, Temptations from without of &s;everal Sorts, a contracted Habit by a long Cour&s;e of evil Doings; of which la&s;t &s;ee <HI>Jer.</HI> 2.24. and Chap. 13.23.</P>
<P>If Men's Inability to do well be of the latter Sort mentioned, In&s;tructions, Exhortations, Reproofs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are not in the lea&s;t &s;uited to help and &s;trengthen them. Arguments will give no Power of the Kind needed by the Per&s;on that has none; and it is wholly in vain to make u&s;e of any to that End. But if a Per&s;on's Weakne&s;s and Ina|bility to do well, be of the other Kind mentioned, then In&s;tructions, Exhortations, and convincing Arguments, are a proper Remedy a|gain&s;t &s;uch Weakne&s;s, and may greatly &s;trengthen the Subjects of it. Means of this Kind, commonly called <HI>moral Sua&s;ion,</HI> can be of no o|ther U&s;e than this: Nor are the &s;ame de&s;igned by God, for the Pro|duction of &s;uper-natural Effects, as the immediate End of them: They only enable Men to exerci&s;e the Powers they have, but give none to &s;uch as are wholly without Strength.</P>
<P>The <HI>Drawing</HI> by the Father, without which no Man can come to the Son, I take to be of this Kind, as above. I do not think that by <HI>Drawing,</HI> our Lord intends the great Work of Regeneration, for the Rea&s;ons which I have given: And this Kind of Drawing Sinners have who never yet come to the Son, in tho&s;e Strivings of the Spirit of God with them, which they often re&s;i&s;t and quench, of which here|after, in Chap. XIX.</P>
<P>But if the Expo&s;ition I have given of the Texts objected be refu|&s;ed, and the Sen&s;e of them which I oppo&s;e be &s;till contended for, let us &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the Con&s;equences which will follow it.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="005439_0156_10183289d64b36e0">The De&s;ign then, with which the&s;e Texts are urged, is, to &s;hew that no Man has Power of any Kind, to come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for ever|la&s;ting Life, but tho&s;e only, who, being unto that End fir&s;t born of the Spirit, do actually go to him, and are eternally &s;aved: So that all others, being wholly without Power to come to the only Saviour of Sinners, do unavoidably continue in that Unbelief, again&s;t which e|ternal Damnation is denounced, <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. They <HI>cannot</HI> come to Chri&s;t that they may have Life, and this <HI>Cannot,</HI> is not only becau&s;e they <HI>will not</HI>; but they have no &s;uch Power latent in them, which being excited and &s;tirred up, they might go to Chri&s;t for the eternal Salvation of their Souls. The Impo&s;&s;ibility, therefore, that they are under of going to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for Salvation, is <HI>phy&s;ical,</HI> as to the Kind of it, and not <HI>moral</HI> only; for they mu&s;t have a Work of new Creation wrought in them, before this phy&s;ical Impotence can be re|moved: Nor are they &s;uppo&s;ed to have any Offer of this Benefit made to them, on any Condition what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Now the plain Con&s;equence of what is thus maintained &s;eems to be this, That all that peri&s;h under the Go&s;pel, do peri&s;h unavoidably, any Means or Advantages they enjoy notwith&s;tanding. They have no Advantage in their Hands, by the Improvement of which they may make &s;ure of the Salvation of their Souls: This is not promi&s;ed to them, on any Condition within the Compa&s;s of their Power; nor is any Strength, by which they may clo&s;e with Chri&s;t, ever conferred on them.</P>
<P>Now, if the Ca&s;e be really &s;uch as has been now expre&s;&s;ed, I would fain know what Kindne&s;s (if any at all) is &s;hewed to tho&s;e that fail of Salvation: Or will it be &s;aid, That in the Revelation of a Way of Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, there is no real Favour &s;hown to any but tho&s;e who &s;hall eventually be &s;aved? May we then tell tho&s;e to whom we preach the Go&s;pel, that unle&s;s they obtain eternal Life, God has &s;hown them no real Kindne&s;s, in all that which has been done, of which we have an Account in the Go&s;pel? Can we think that the maintaining of this would be to the Honour of divine Grace? For my Part, I cannot think that all that &s;eeming Love which God manife&s;ts to Mankind, in &s;ending his Son to redeem a &s;inful World, and &s;etting up a Treaty of Peace among all tho&s;e to whom the Go&s;pel is preached, is no Kindne&s;s to &s;uch as are not eventually &s;aved. Such an Opinion as this &s;eems not to agree with &s;uch Texts as the&s;e which follow, <HI>viz. John</HI> 3.16. 1 <HI>John</HI> 2.2. and Chap. 4.19. &s;o <HI>Luke</HI> 2.10, 11. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.18, 19, 20. and many other Places.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="005439_0157_1018323aaf3abe78">Nor can I, I confe&s;s, &s;ee how any &s;hould be obliged to be thank|ful to God for his Goodne&s;s in &s;ending his Son to redeem us, and his Go&s;pel to per&s;uade us to be reconciled unto him, if he hath &s;hewed no real Kindne&s;s in it.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. That Grace is not given according to Works, is no Ways incon&s;i&s;tent with the Hypothe&s;is by me defended.</HEAD>
<P>_SOME may think that if, as I a&s;&s;ert, Sinners have in the Go&s;pel an Offer of the Grace given in Regene|ration, made to them, it will from hence follow, that Grace is given according to Works; which is an Error condemned in the Church of God, in all Ages; and very contrary to the Holy Scriptures, as in 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.9. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.5. and <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.6. I &s;hall therefore con&s;ider, whether on this Account there can be any ju&s;t Objection rai&s;ed again&s;t the Po&s;ition I endeavour to defend. And to this End, I &s;hall con&s;ider, (1) What may be intended by Grace in the Objection. (2) What may be meant by its not being given accor|ding to Works. (3) Whether, the&s;e Things being rightly under|&s;tood,
<PB N="143" REF="005439_0158_1018328c1446df48">
the Propo&s;ition oppo&s;ed to my Hypothe&s;is, does really make any Thing again&s;t it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us con&s;ider what we may here under&s;tand by Grace. Now by Grace here, the Grace of God is doubtle&s;s to be under&s;tood: And by God's Grace, his unde&s;erved Favour is mo&s;t properly meant, in which Sen&s;e it being taken, it cannot be obtained by any according to Works: To affirm this would be a plain Contradiction both to it&s;elf, and to the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. 4.4. <HI>To him that worketh is the Reward not reckoned of Grace, but of Debt.</HI> Al&s;o Rom. 11.6. <HI>If by Grace, then it is no more of Works: Otherwi&s;e Grace is no more Grace. But if it be of Works, then it is no more Grace: Otherwi&s;e Work is no more Work.</HI> By that Grace which is in Scripture, and by the Church of God in all Ages, denied to be given according to Works, I under|&s;tand the free and unde&s;erved Favour of God, with all tho&s;e Benefits which flow from it to his People. Mo&s;t properly the Grace of God &s;ignifies the unde&s;erved Favour of God to tho&s;e whom he has &s;et his Love upon; and hence, by a <HI>Metonimy</HI> of the Cau&s;e for the Effect, the Word Grace is u&s;ed for tho&s;e Benefits which God of his free Grace be&s;tows on the Children of Men; e&s;pecially on tho&s;e whom he eter|nally &s;aves. And taken in this Sen&s;e, Grace &s;ignifies Ju&s;tification and Adoption; and al&s;o that Principle of Grace which is given in our Regeneration, and all tho&s;e holy Actions which by his adjutant Grace proceed from it.</P>
<P>Now, tho' Grace may be taken in any or all of the&s;e Sen&s;es, in the Que&s;tion under Con&s;ideration; yet my pre&s;ent De&s;ign leads me to con&s;ider it as it intends that Principle of Holine&s;s which God be|&s;tows on Sinners in their Regeneration; this being that which I &s;ay is conditionally offered in the Go&s;pel, and which many deny &s;o to be.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us con&s;ider what is intended by this Propo&s;ition, That Grace is not given according to Works. And unto this I an&s;wer, that there are two Things, either or both of which may be intended thereby. (1) That God does not be&s;tow his Grace on the Children of Men, in the Way, or on the Terms, of the Covenant of Works, wherein perfect and perpetual Obedience to the Law of God was the Condition whereon Life and Happine&s;s were promi&s;ed to Man|kind. God does not now offer or be&s;tow his Grace on &s;uch Terms as the&s;e. That Covenant has long &s;ince been broken by all Mankind; and all that Good which was conditionally promi&s;ed in it, utterly and for ever forfeited and lo&s;t. Such as will now adhere to this Cove|nant, can expect no Good at God's Hands, nothing le&s;s than the
<PB N="144" REF="005439_0159_1018323c90199500">
Wrath and Curie denounced therein again&s;t the Breakers of it, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10. Or, (2) That Grace is not given according to Works, may intend, that it is not given as a ju&s;t Reward of, or for, good Works performed, tho' they are not &s;uppo&s;ed to come up to the Terms of the fir&s;t Covenant. Per&s;ons may think that, for the Ser|vices they perform to God, they de&s;erve well at his Hand; &s;o that it is but a ju&s;t and equal Thing that he &s;hould &s;ave them, tho' they are guilty of many Failings. They may think they carry them&s;elves &s;o well, that God will deal hardly by them, if he grants not his &s;pecial Favour to them, and think they well de&s;erve it. <HI>Wherefore have we fa&s;ted,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>and thou &s;ee&s;t it not? Wherefore have we afflicted our &s;elves, and thou take&s;t no Knowledge?</HI> I&s;ai. 58.3. Ob&s;erve how well the <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> thought of his Performances, <HI>Luke</HI> 18.10, 11. Per&s;ons that go about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and obtain God's Favour and Grace on the Account of it, do not always &s;uppo&s;e that they come fully up to the Terms of the Covenant of Works. They have too much Light to think &s;o. But, however, they think very much to commend them&s;elves to God, by their good Performances; and on them they tru&s;t for Acceptance with him, and for all the Grace they hope to receive from him. This &s;eems evidently to be the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e &s;poken of by the great Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> Rom. 9.31, 32. <HI>But</HI> I&s;rael <HI>which followed after the Law of Righteou&s;ne&s;s hath not attained to the Law of Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Wherefore? Becau&s;e they &s;ought it, not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law.</HI> They did not, indeed, expect to be ju&s;tified, and find Favour with God, by the Works of the Law, or by fully complying with the Tenor of the Law of Works; yet they depended on their own good Works, for the Benefits they needed, and &s;o they &s;ought tho&s;e Benefits, as it were, by the Deeds of the Law. Compare with this, that in Chap. 10.3. Men oftner mi&s;carry in this Way, than by thinking that they can come fully up to the Terms of the fir&s;t Covenant. They think to com|mend them&s;elves to God by their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, tho' they do not think that they can do all that the Covenant of Works required.</P>
<P>But the Apo&s;tle &s;hews the Vanity of &s;uch Hopes, in the mentioned <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10. compared with Ver&s;e 12. and el&s;ewhere. If Grace were given in the Way &s;uch as the&s;e &s;eek it, it would be given ac|cording to Works. But I acknowledge, that God does not be&s;tow his Grace upon Sinners in this Way. He grants it not to them on Account of any Goodne&s;s in them, nor for the Sake of any Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s performed by them, as plainly appears in 2 Tim. 1.9. <HI>Who hath &s;aved us, and called us with an holy Calling, not according to our Works, but according to his own Purpo&s;e and Grace which was given
<PB N="145" REF="005439_0160_10183290ef30cb98">
us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, before the World began.</HI> So again in Tit. 3.5. <HI>Not by Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, but according to his Mercy he &s;aved us, by the Wa&s;hing of Regeneration, and Renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Let us con&s;ider whether the objected Propo&s;ition being under|&s;tood as now explained, any Thing can be inferred from it again&s;t the Hypothe&s;is by me defended. And to this I &s;ay, I think it will appear there cannot, if we con&s;ider what here followeth.</P>
<P>As, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That Grace is, on my Hypothe&s;is, given according to Promi&s;e, or in the Way of a conditional Covenant, is not equivalent to its being given according to Works, in the Sen&s;e explained. Things may neverthele&s;s be freely given, for being given in the Way of a conditional Covenant. Indeed it is not &s;o, if the Condition re|quired be a valuable Con&s;ideration, &s;uch as de&s;erves a Reward, or &s;ome Te&s;timony of Gratitude, on the Account of Things required to be done; but very frequently this is not the Ca&s;e, nor is &s;o in the Ca&s;e under Con&s;ideration, as I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;how.</P>
<P>However, If God's be&s;towing his Benefits on Men, in the Way of a Covenant, wherein &s;omething is required to be done by them, in order to their obtaining of them; and unto the doing whereof a Promi&s;e is annexed, would infer or imply their obtaining them by their own good Works or Merits, it would from hence follow, That Pardon of Sin and eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s are Benefits given according to Works; for the&s;e Benefits are certainly obtained in a covenant Way. The Scriptures are plain as to this; and none, that I know of, be&s;ides <HI>Antinomians</HI> deny it. I &s;hall only refer to &s;ome of the Texts in which this is manife&s;t: I need not tran&s;cribe them. See <HI>Mark</HI> 16.15, 16. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37, 38, 39. and Chap. 10.43. and 16.30, 31. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 103.17, 18.</P>
<P>Tho' our Divines many of them deny, that the Grace of Rege|neration, or of a new Heart, is given in the Way of a conditional Covenant; yet I &s;uppo&s;e there are &s;carce any of them but what own Ju&s;tification, Adoption, and eternal Glory to be thus given: But now, if, becau&s;e I hold that God gives his Holy Spirit, and the &s;aving Graces thereof, in the Way of a conditional Promi&s;e, it be thence in|ferred, that, according to my Hypothe&s;is, it is given according to Works, or according to Men's Merits, I would know if it would not as well follow from the &s;ame Premi&s;es, with Relation to the other mentioned Benefits, that they al&s;o are given according to Works, or the Merits of tho&s;e on whom they are be&s;towed: But as this does not follow from the mentioned Premi&s;es, &s;o neither does the other.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="005439_0161_1018323ed078c430"><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Grace of Regeneration cannot, on my Principles, be given according to Works; becau&s;e, on my Hypothe&s;is, no Man can perform any good Works, properly and &s;trictly &s;o called, 'till after he is regenerate or born again. That Grace may be given according to Works, two Things &s;eem nece&s;&s;arily required, <HI>viz.</HI> (1) That the Works are really good and holy, with Regard to which the Grace intended is &s;uppo&s;ed to be given: For it is not likely that God &s;hould give his Grace as a Reward for Works not truly good and holy. (2) That the Works intended be done before the Grace is be&s;towed, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be given as a Reward of them: For the Thing for which a Reward is given mu&s;t needs be prior to that which is given as a Reward of it. But I, as well as tho&s;e with whom I di&s;pute, am fully of Opinion, that no Man can perform any good Action, (meaning by good what is in a proper and &s;trict Sen&s;e &s;o,) 'till after he is <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> or <HI>created anew unto good Works,</HI> as in <HI>Col.</HI> 3.10. with which compare <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26, 27. and <HI>Luke</HI> 6.43, 44, 45. How then &s;hould the Grace of Regeneration be given, on my Principles, according to Men's good Works or Merits?</P>
<P>If we duly con&s;ider what, according to my Principles, is really re|quired of Sinners, in order to their obtaining the Grace of Regeneration, it will plainly appear, that Grace is not given to them according to Works. The Condition on which, according to my Opinion, Grace is offered to them, does neither con&s;i&s;t in the perfect Obedience which the Covenant of Works required, nor yet in &s;uch Holine&s;s as the Go&s;|pel requireth of regenerate Saints: If it required the la&s;t of the&s;e no Per&s;on could ever be regenerated or born again.</P>
<P>But what the Go&s;pel requires of unregenerate Sinners, to the men|tioned End, compri&s;es in it &s;uch Things as the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> (1) That they acknowledge their Sinfulne&s;s, both by Nature and Practice, and that they de&s;erve eternal Damnation. (2) That they acknowledge the Guilt of their many and mighty Sins, and that without the Par|don of them they never can be &s;aved. (3) That they are &s;en&s;ible of the Corruption of their Natures, and their Need of regenerating Grace. (4) That they believe the good Tidings of that Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which is revealed in the Go&s;pel, and do not de&s;pair of God's Mercy. (5) That they &s;eek earne&s;tly to God for the Pardon of their Sins, and the regenerating Influences of his Spirit, &s;eriou&s;ly waiting on him in the U&s;e of tho&s;e Means which he has directed to, in order to their obtaining the&s;e Mercies. (6) That they carefully avoid all tho&s;e &s;inful Cour&s;es which tend to provoke him to deny his Holy Spirit, or with-hold the &s;ame from them. (7) That they per|&s;evere
<PB N="147" REF="005439_0162_10183293e10df5b8">
in the Way of their Duty, that has now been expre&s;&s;ed. (8) That they confe&s;s, that in all this they are unprofitable Servants, and in&s;tead of doing more than their Duty, they fall infinitely &s;hort of it, and &s;o are not worthy of the lea&s;t of God's Mercies, much le&s;s of Par|don of Sin, and the &s;aving Graces of God's Spirit here, and eternal Glory hereafter. (9) That they earne&s;tly plead with God the Pro|mi&s;es of his Mercy, made to &s;uch as &s;eek him for it; &s;uch as we have in <HI>Matth.</HI> 7.7,&mdash;11. <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.22, 23, <HI>Luke</HI> 11.9,&mdash;13. <HI>Prov.</HI> 2.1,&mdash;5. <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 6.3.</P>
<P>If in this Way Sinners &s;eek and obtain the &s;aving Graces of God's holy Spirit, they will find no Occa&s;ion of boa&s;ting that they obtained them by Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which they have done, or by the De&s;ert of their own good Works, and &s;o have merited eternal Life at the Hand of God. There is not the lea&s;t Appearance of any &s;uch Thing in the Method propo&s;ed, of Sinners &s;eeking Mercy of the Lord; they having Nothing to recommend them to him, or to plead with him, but their own Poverty and Mi&s;ery, and the Riches of his Grace and Mercy, and mo&s;t gracious Covenant: All which is nothing like tru&s;ting in, and pleading, their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Our &s;uppo&s;ing that to our obtaining the Grace of God, our begging God's Mercy, pleading the Merits of his Son, and his Truth and Faithfulne&s;s to his Covenant, is not, I think, to hold, that Grace is given according to Works, but well con&s;i&s;teth with that <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.9. and Rom. 3.27. <HI>Where is Boa&s;ting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of Works? Nay: But by the Law of Faith.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. That the be&s;t Actions of the Unregenerate are not properly called Sins, nor uncapable of being Conditions of the Covenant of Grace.</HEAD>
<P>_I HAVE owned and a&s;&s;erted in the foregoing Chap|ter, That Per&s;ons in an unregenerate State, cannot perform any Actions that are, in a &s;trict Sen&s;e, holy, and as &s;uch, well-plea&s;ing in God's Sight; but I think they carry this too far, who affirm the be&s;t Actions of the Unregenerate to be properly dono|minated Sins, and an Abomination in God's Sight, and accur&s;ed; yea, that <HI>common Grace is Sin and Lu&s;t.</HI> I chu&s;e not to name the Per&s;ons who expre&s;s them&s;elves after this Manner, but can do it, if it be nece&s;&s;ary for my own Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, if what is to this Effect &s;aid by many, be true, it will follow, that nothing that can be done by any Per&s;on that is not <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> can be the Condition of the new Covenant, and as &s;uch, entitle the Doer of it to eternal Life. I &s;hall therefore endeavour to make it appear, that that which is a&s;&s;erted, as above, is not to be ad|mitted as a Truth, however worthy the Names of the Per&s;ons are who have &s;poken to this Purpo&s;e. And to this End I &s;hall make &s;ome Ob|&s;ervations relating to the Matter under Con&s;ideration; which being put together, will, I think, &s;ufficiently clear up the Point in Debate.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Even tho&s;e Actions that are e&s;teemed materially evil, as being expre&s;ly forbidden by the Law of God, and may on that Ac|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">unt be oppo&s;ed unto &s;uch Actions as are &s;aid to be materially good; even &s;uch Actions as the&s;e, I &s;ay, have &s;omething that is good in them. It is generally acknowledged that the&s;e Actions, con&s;idered in the phy&s;ical Entity of them, are good Things; and that they are only evil, con&s;idered in re&s;pect of the Relation they bear to the divine Law, which they are a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of; &s;o that tho' &s;uch Actions cannot be performed without the Commi&s;&s;ion of Sin in the doing of them, being &s;o forbidden; yet there is a Di&s;tinction to be made betwixt the Actions them&s;elves, con&s;idered only as Actions, or in re&s;pect of the
<PB N="149" REF="005439_0164_10183298d39e2010">
Sub&s;tance of them, and con&s;idered with Re&s;pect to the Obliquity of the &s;ame Actions, as they have a Relation to the Law of God, where|in they are forbidden to the Per&s;ons who &s;in in doing them. Such Actions therefore, &s;eem more properly called <HI>&s;inful,</HI> than <HI>Sin</HI> in the Ab&s;tract; becau&s;e the <HI>former</HI> di&s;tingui&s;heth betwixt the Act it&s;elf, and the Vitio&s;ity of it, whereas the <HI>latter</HI> does not.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There is a great Difference betwixt &s;uch forbidden Actions and &s;uch as are not forbidden, but may either lawfully be done or let alone: And it &s;eems not very proper to call tho&s;e Actions Sins, which God has no where forbidden. It is readily granted, that Per&s;ons may &s;in greatly in the Performance of &s;uch, <HI>viz.</HI> either in the Manner how, or End for which they do them; but not in doing the Thing done by them. When therefore it is &s;aid, That <HI>the Ploughing of the Wicked is Sin</HI>; this mu&s;t not be under&s;tood as if their &s;o doing was Sin in the Ab&s;tract; but the Meaning is, That the Wicked &s;in in their Ploughing, <HI>i. e.</HI> that their is Sin cleaving to this Action of their's, tho' it be in it&s;elf no Sin: And thus I acknowledge, that there is Sin cleaving to the be&s;t Actions of the be&s;t Men, <HI>Eccle.</HI> 7.20. But more abundantly to the Actions of the Unregenerate.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI> There is a &s;till greater Difference between the forbidden Actions of the Unregenerate, and tho&s;e which they do, being com|manded to perform them. For In&s;tance: God forbids them to take his Name in vain, but requires them to call on him. Their doing the fir&s;t of the&s;e is no doubt a great Sin: But is their calling on him a Sin too? Or is their doing it their Sin? I think not. It may indeed be truly &s;aid, that they &s;in in not doing it as they ought. But this may be truly &s;aid of the Actions of the Regenerate al&s;o, tho' the Un|regenerate fail much more in this Re&s;pect. I think there is a great Difference betwixt &s;aying, all the Prayers of the Unregenerate have Sin in them, and &s;aying they are all of them Sin.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> There is a great deal of Difference between &s;uch Actions as have &s;ome po&s;itive Wickedne&s;s committed in the Performance of them, and &s;uch as are only negatively faulty, ina&s;much as they want &s;ome good Qualifications which they have not: As &s;uppo&s;e one Man performs a materially good Action, out of &s;ome wicked and malicious End, as out of Hatred to God or his Neighbour; but Another per|forms the &s;ame Action, or another like it, not out of any &s;uch wicked De&s;ign, but yet without any true Love to God and his Neighbour: Are the&s;e both alike properly called Sins? Or are they both wicked
<PB N="150" REF="005439_0165_10183245375cca60">
Actions? One of them &s;eems to be &s;o, indeed, being done for a wicked End; but what of Wickedne&s;s is there in the other, tho' it would have been much better had there been &s;ome other Kind of Goodne&s;s in it, which it had not? The Per&s;on that does it is, indeed, to blame; but this is becau&s;e he omitted &s;omething which &s;hould have been done; not becau&s;e what he did had any Evil in it. The Di|&s;tinction I have in&s;i&s;ted on, &s;eems evidently countenanced by that Text, <HI>Prov.</HI> 21.27. according to that Tran&s;lation of the Words, which I chu&s;e, and Mr. POOL &s;eems be&s;t to approve, <HI>viz. The Sa|crifice of the Wicked is an Abomination,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>he bringeth it with a wicked Mind.</HI> Thus the latter Part of the Ver&s;e, gives the Rea&s;on of what is affirmed in the fir&s;t Part of it; for according to this Reading of the Words, they are accounted Wicked, who bring their Offerings with wicked Minds and Intentions; and the Rea&s;on of God's abhorring them is, their being offered in &s;uch a Manner, or for &s;uch Ends. Nor is there any Rea&s;on to think that by the Wicked in this Place and others like it, all unregenerate Per&s;ons are intended; but &s;uch as are meant in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.16. not tho&s;e that are called <HI>Righteous</HI> in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.24, 26. and &s;everal other Places, tho' Unregenerate.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Many of the Actions of the Unregenerate are not only good, as above, but are performed from good Principles and for good Ends. When an unregenerate Per&s;on feeds the Hungary, and clothes the Naked, out of natural Compa&s;&s;ion which he has towards them, it mu&s;t be acknowledged that this is a good Principle. It is not indeed true Grace or Holine&s;s, neither is it from a corrupt and wicked Principle, or from <HI>Sin that dwelleth in him.</HI> It is really from Grace, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Grace of Nature, or &s;ome Remainder of the natural Image of God, left in Man after his Fall, which is good, tho' it is not Goodne&s;s of the be&s;t Kind. It is no Part of the Image of God lo&s;t by the Fall, and re&s;tored in our Regeneration, nor does our Regene|ration eradicate, but &s;anctify it. So unregenerate Per&s;ons perform &s;ome Actions for good Ends; as when they labour with their Hands that they may get their Bread hone&s;tly, and not &s;teal from and rob Others to get it. So when an unregenerate Per&s;on reads the Word of God, hears it preached, and meditates on it, and calls on the Lord, to the End that he may e&s;cape Damnation, and obtain the great Sal|vation offered in the Go&s;pel; the&s;e are good Ends, &s;uch as God re|quireth him to aim at in the Performance of &s;uch Duties. If a Man labours to obtain his own Happine&s;s, this, indeed, is not the highe&s;t End of all, which is the Glory of God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.31. And even this an unregenerate Per&s;on may aim at in what he does, tho' not ul|timately,
<PB N="151" REF="005439_0166_1018329c47537530">
as what he chiefly intends. Nor ought regenerate Per&s;ons to cea&s;e to aim at the Salvation of their own Souls, in what they do, after they can a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> at a higher End than this.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Many of the materially good Actions which unregenerate Per&s;ons perform, are the Effects of the Grace of God, in and upon them; and therefore, I think, not Sins. I cannot think that Actions which Men perform by the Help and Influence of the Word and Spirit of God, are well called Sins. God may be truly &s;aid to be the Author of &s;uch Actions: It is he, of his Grace, who &s;tirs up and excites poor &s;inful Creatures to perform the Actions I &s;peak of. He enables and excites them to hear, read, meditate, and pray, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and he is the Author of &s;uch Faith as they have, who believe &s;ometimes only for a while, as in <HI>Luke</HI> 8.13. Or may it not be granted, that &s;uch Faith, Repentance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the be&s;t, of which unregenerate Per&s;ons are &s;ometimes the Subjects, are Effects of the Grace of God, wrought by God's Word and Spirit in their Souls, and frequently called <HI>common Grace?</HI> And are they, this notwith&s;tanding, all Sin, and an Abomi|nation in God's Sight, and, as &s;ome &s;ay, contrary to &s;aving Grace? I con&s;tantly maintain, that there is a <HI>&s;pecifical</HI> Difference betwixt common Grace, and that which is &s;pecial; but I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to oppo&s;e them one to the other, as <HI>Contraries</HI> are oppo&s;ed. Whether by common Grace we intend tho&s;e gracious Influences of God's holy Spirit, with which the Unregenerate are &s;ometimes &s;avoured, or the good Effects produced in them by the&s;e gracious Operations, I am not, for my Part, willing to allow them to be Sin.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> I think what is &s;aid by that learned Man, Dr. OWEN, in his <HI>Per&s;everance of the Saints,</HI> Chap. I. Sect. 17. much favours what I have in this Chapter a&s;&s;erted.
<Q>Of tho&s;e who are &s;aid to believe and to be holy <HI>really,</HI> and in the Truth of the Thing it &s;elf; there are two Sorts. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Such as having received &s;undry common Gift<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Graces of the Spirit, as <HI>Illumination</HI> of the Mind, <HI>Change</HI> of Affections, and thence <HI>Amendment</HI> of Life, with <HI>Sorrow of the World, legal Repentance, temporary Faith,</HI> and the like, which are all <HI>true</HI> and <HI>real</HI> in their Kind, do thereby become Ve&s;&s;els in the great Hou&s;e of God, being changed as to their U&s;e, tho' not in their Nature, continuing Stone and Wood &s;till, tho' hewed and turned into the Serviccablene&s;s of Ve&s;&s;els, and on that Account are frequently termed Saints and Believers. On &s;uch as the&s;e there is a <HI>lower</HI> (and in &s;ome a <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI>) Work of the Spirit, effectually produci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g (<HI>in</HI> and <HI>on</HI> all the Faculties of their Souls) &s;omewhat that
<PB N="152" REF="005439_0167_10183246f0135f80">
is <HI>true, good,</HI> and <HI>u&s;eful</HI> in it &s;elf, an&s;wering in &s;ome Likene&s;s and Suitablene&s;s of Operation unto the great Work of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> which faileth not. There is in them <HI>Light, Love, Joy, Faith, Zeal, Obedience,</HI> &amp;c. all true in their Kind, which make many of them in whom they are, do worthily in their Generation, howbeit they attain not to the Faith of God's Elect, neither doth Chri&s;t live in them, nor is the Life which they lead, by the Faith of the Son of God: As &s;hall hereafter be fully declared.</Q></P>
<P>I now appeal to &s;uch as are judicious, whether the be&s;t Actions of the Unregenerate are properly their Sins: If they be not, then we cannot from a fal&s;e Propo&s;ition prove, that none of them can be, by the Con|&s;titution of God, appointed to be Conditions of the new Covenant.</P>
<P>I think it plainly appears, from what has been above &s;aid, That the be&s;t Actions of the Unregenerate, have not more of moral Evil than of moral Goodne&s;s in them; I therefore do not believe any Conclu|&s;ion that can be drawn from a Suppo&s;ition hereof.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> If the be&s;t Actions of the Unregenerate be truly and pro|perly Sins, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on at pre&s;ent, but that it were better that they were let alone, than done. If it be &s;aid, that tho' the doing of them be Sin, yet it is a greater Sin to omit them; I an&s;wer, that if they are properly Sins, I know not of any Rule Men have, of two Sins to chu&s;e the lea&s;t: I believe that neither the one nor the other ought to be cho&s;en, but that both ought to be abhorred. Indeed, of two Things where one is le&s;s good than the other, if both cannot be done, the be&s;t ought to be made choice of; but where both the Things in Que&s;tion are properly Sins, this is not the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But I believe that if the be&s;t Actions (if I may &s;o &s;peak) of the Un|regenerate were really Sins, all the Regenerate would be obliged to repent of all they did before their Regeneration, &amp; in order to it, as their Reading, Hearing, Meditating, Praying for converting Grace, Giving Alms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I confe&s;s they ought to repent that they performed the&s;e Things in no better a Manner than they did; but not that they did them at all, tho' they did them not in &s;uch a Manner as the Regene|rate only can perform Actions that are good in Re&s;pect of the Matter, or general Nature of them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. The Doctrine I plead for, no ways incon&s;i&s;tent with that of Prede&s;tination, and the &s;ove|reign Freedom of the Grace of <HI>GOD</HI> in the Salvation of his Elect.</HEAD>
<P>_I FREELY acknowledge that it is implied in the Doctrine I plead for, That Sinners who peri&s;h un|der the Go&s;pel, do not peri&s;h for want of Power to comply with the Terms of the new Covenant: That they fail of the Grace of God, or fall &s;hort of eternal Life, is (according to my Principles) not becau&s;e the Condition of the Covenant of Grace is &s;uch, that tho&s;e who are not &s;aved, have no Power to perform it; but becau&s;e they <HI>will not</HI> do &s;o, John 5.40. <HI>And ye will not come to me that ye might have Life,</HI> And Matth. 23.37. <HI>O</HI> Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, <HI>thou that kille&s;t the Prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them which are &s;ent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not!</HI> Indeed I cannot &s;ee how the new Covenant could be fitly called the Covenant of Grace, if the Condition of it were &s;o very difficult, that all that fall &s;hort of the Good of it, might truly plead, That it never was in their Power to comply with the Terms on which Salvation is offered to them in it: But that under all the &s;eeming Advantages of the Go&s;pel which they have enjoyed, their eternal Damnation has been, as to any Thing they could do, utterly unavoidable. Indeed I cannot think this to be the Truth of Man's Ca&s;e, while he enjoys the Grace of God granted to him, in and with the Go&s;pel, as in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.1.</P>
<P>Now, whether the Doctrine of <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> and of the free and &s;overeign Grace of God, manife&s;ted in the Conver&s;ion and eternal Salvation of Sinners, be at all incon&s;i&s;tent with the Opinion I enter|tain, is what, in this Chapter, is to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>It is then, or may be here &s;aid, that if a &s;inful Man hath &s;uch a Power as is here &s;uppo&s;ed, it will from hence follow, That his Salva|tion cannot depend on God's &s;overeign Grace: For if Grace and
<PB N="154" REF="005439_0169_1018324900b2fc50">
Salvation be offered and promi&s;ed, on a Condition which Man has Power to perform, or not to perform, then it is in his own Power to determine this Point, whether he &s;hall be &s;aved, or not; and &s;o his Salvation cannot depend on divine Sovereignty, but on his own free Will, which is contrary to the Doctrine of orthodox Prote&s;tants, who con&s;tantly maintain the Sovereignty of God with Relation to Man's Salvation; which is al&s;o agreeable to that of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 9.11. and onwards, where he &s;heweth at large, that <HI>God hath Mercy and Compa&s;&s;ion on whom he will</HI>; and he concludeth from it in Ver&s;e 19. that <HI>it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that &s;heweth Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>Now, this Objection hath great Appearance of Strength in it; and I know of Nothing that &s;eems to make more again&s;t the Doctrine I plead for, than this does: I &s;hall therefore endeavour to give it a ju&s;t and impartial Con&s;ideration, in the Particulars which here follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. As I have formerly &s;aid, &s;o I &s;ay now, that I am fully per&s;uad|ed of the Truth of the Doctrine of God's Decrees of <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation,</HI> as the &s;ame is revealed in Scripture; and for the Sub|&s;tance, as it is explained in our <HI>Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith</HI> and <HI>Catechi&s;ms,</HI> and by our orthodox Divines, &s;uch as Dr. TWISSE, Dr. OWEN, Mr. NORTON, Dr. MATHER, Mr. WILLARD, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I hold God's Decree to be ab&s;olute, eternal and unchangeable; and that he has cho&s;en a definite Number of Per&s;ons to Salvation, who&s;e Names are all written in the Book of Life, pa&s;&s;ing by and not chu&s;ing <HI>the Re&s;t,</HI> as they are called <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.7. and that all, and only tho&s;e that are &s;o cho&s;en &s;hall be eternally &s;aved.</P>
<P N="2">2. I am per&s;uaded, that in chu&s;ing a Number of Mankind to Sal|vation, and in pa&s;&s;ing by the Re&s;t, God acted in a Way of ab&s;olute Sovereignty, doing therein according to his own good Will and Plea|&s;ure, not being moved by any Cau&s;es or Motives out of him&s;elf, as by any Excellency in One more than in Another, or by any Faith or good Works fore&s;een, or by any Wickedne&s;s fore&s;een in them that are not cho&s;en.</P>
<P N="3">3. I have no Doubt but that God acts as an ab&s;olute Sovereign, in the Execution of his Decrees, as well as in willing the Events de|creed by him, <HI>doing as he will in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth,</HI> Dan. 4.35.</P>
<P N="4">4. I am accordingly well &s;atisfied, that the future and eternal State of Mankind, whether of Weal or Woe, dependeth on the Sove|reignty of God, who <HI>hath Mercy on whom he will,</HI> as is above declared from <HI>Rom.</HI> Chap. 9.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="005439_0170_1018329fadf8a188">But the <HI>great Que&s;tion</HI> here is, Whether all this being granted and received for Truth, the Inference or Con&s;equence drawn from it in the Objection, that then it cannot be in the Power of tho&s;e to whom Grace and Salvation is offered in the Go&s;pel, either to accept the &s;ame, on the Condition on which it is offered, or not to accept it, refu&s;ing &s;o to do, when the Con&s;equence depending on their doing or not doing it, is, according to the Tenor of the new Covenant, either their Sal|vation or Damnation? As in <HI>Mark</HI> 16.15, 16. This, I &s;ay, is what I conceive to be the <HI>great Que&s;tion</HI> here, and I am content that a due Re&s;olution of this &s;hould decide the main Que&s;tion, which in this Di&s;cour&s;e, I have under Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Now the turning Point here is, Whether the Liberty of rea&s;o|nable Creatures, in their Actions, will not con&s;i&s;t with the Decree and governing Providence of God, in ordering all Events according to his own Plea&s;ure? Or in the Language of Scripture, in <HI>Working all Things after the Coun&s;el of his own Will?</HI> Eph. 1.11. For if God's decreeing future Events, does not take away the Liberty of &s;ubordinate Agents, concerned in the Execution of his Purpo&s;es, or their Power of doing or not doing what is done by them, why may not he that believes and is &s;aved be &s;uppo&s;ed at the &s;ame Time to have had Power, his Election notwith&s;tanding, not to have believed: And on the other Hand, he that does not believe, and &s;o peri&s;heth, to have or to have had Power to believe, tho' he did not, and tho' this were according to God's Decree. The Decree does not take away this Power, or rather is not incon&s;i&s;tent with it. However this may &s;eem a Paradox to many; a Creature may have Power to perform an Action which God has decreed he &s;hall not do. This will appear if the Manner of his decreeing what free Agents &s;hall do or not do, be duly con&s;idered and under&s;tood.</P>
<P>A little to clear up this Point, I &s;hall (1) Shew the pernicious Con&s;equences that will follow upon denying it. (2) Produce &s;ome Authorities for it. (3) E&s;&s;ay briefly to &s;hew the &s;ame to be in Rea|&s;on po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Now for the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> If God's decreeing that his rea&s;onable Creatures &s;hall do, or not do, this or that Action, be incon&s;i&s;tent with a Power or Liberty in them to do the contrary, then it will follow, either that he has not decreed all their Actions, and does not by his Providence order and bring about all tho&s;e Things which are done by them: Or otherwi&s;e, they having no Liberty re&s;pecting tho&s;e Things or Events which God has decreed &s;hall exi&s;t, or come to pa&s;s by their Means,
<PB N="156" REF="005439_0171_1018324f1d62feb8">
they are under an inevitable Nece&s;&s;ity of doing whatever Actions are done by them, and have no more Liberty than a Clock or Watch has, that is moved by the Weights and Springs that are the irre&s;i&s;table Cau&s;e of its Motion: And &s;o <HI>Hobbs,</HI> who a&s;&s;erted the Nece&s;&s;ity of all Things, was in the Right. The Con&s;equence of the fir&s;t Suppo&s;i|tion is, That God does not govern the World, but in &s;ome of the mo&s;t important Concernments of it, lets Things run at Random, according to the Plea&s;ure of fickle and un&s;teady Agents, contrary to <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.11. and many other Texts of Scripture that might be alledged. But otherwi&s;e, according to the other Hypothe&s;is, Creatures having no Power to govern their own Wills and Actions, are mo&s;t certainly in|capable of being govern'd in a moral Way, by Laws with Sanctions annexed to them, <HI>i. e.</HI> Rewards promi&s;ed in Ca&s;e of Obedience, and Puni&s;hments threatned in Ca&s;e of Di&s;obedience: For why &s;hould a Creature be rewarded with Good, or puni&s;hed with Evil, if he has no more Liberty with Re&s;pect to what he does, than a Stone has not to fall, when it is to&s;&s;ed up into the Air? If the Ca&s;e be &s;o, how &s;hould Men's Con&s;ciences accu&s;e them, either for doing what they do, or omitting what they do not, which is one great Part of the Puni&s;hment of their Sins. The Con&s;equences of both the&s;e Suppo&s;itions are intole|rable; therefore neither of the Hypothe&s;es are to be allowed.</P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Learned Men avouch, that God's Decrees re&s;pecting future Events, are con&s;i&s;tent with the Liberty of free Agents, with Relation to what they do in effecting them. Thus that learned and judicious <HI>A&s;&s;embly of Divines</HI> at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> affirm, in their <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> Chap. 3. Sect. 1. That
<Q>tho' God from all Eternity did, by the mo&s;t wi&s;e and holy Coun&s;el of his own Will, freely and unchange|ably ordain what&s;oever comes to pa&s;s; yet &s;o (&s;ay they) as thereby neither is God the Author of Sin, nor is Violence offered to the Will of the Creature, nor is the Liberty or Contingency of &s;econd Cau&s;es taken away, but rather e&s;tabli&s;hed.</Q>
To this Effect al&s;o Dr. TWISSE, in his <HI>Treati&s;e of Reprobation,</HI> in An&s;wer to <HI>Hord</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;on,</HI> Part 2. Page 63. &s;ays, That
<Q>whereas we &s;ee &s;ome Things come to pa&s;s nece&s;&s;arily, &s;ome contingently; &s;o God hath ordained that all Things &s;hall come to pa&s;s; but nece&s;&s;ary Things, nece&s;&s;a|rily, contingent Things, contingently, that is avoidably, and with a Po&s;&s;ibility of not coming to pa&s;s: For every Univer&s;ity Scholar knows this to be the Notion of Contingency.</Q>
Thus al&s;o our Mr. NORTON, in his <HI>Orthodox Evangeli&s;t,</HI> Page 76. &s;ays,
<Q>Man acts as freely as if there were no Decree, yet as infallibly as if there
<PB N="157" REF="005439_0172_101832a34b1835c0">
were no Liberty. Liberty is the Effect of the Decree; &s;o far is the Decree from being a Prejudice to Liberty.</Q></P>
<P>But why &s;hould I quote any other &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages? All that are ac|quainted with the Writings of <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> know that in this Point they are generally agreed; &s;o that I am not &s;ingular with Re&s;pect to this Article.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e I am not willing to content my &s;elf with telling my Reader, that there are great Ab&s;urdities that follow the Denial of this, and that there are many that affirm it, and think they are bound &s;o to do, how difficult &s;oever it be to conceive of the <HI>Modus</HI> thereof; for this Rea&s;on, I &s;ay, I &s;hall not content my &s;elf to re&s;t here, without endeavouring to &s;ay &s;omething briefly, for the clearing up of this Point, and &s;hewing the Po&s;&s;ibility of the Thing a&s;&s;erted. And here I &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it &s;eems evident, that it is impo&s;&s;ible that any Thing &s;hould come to pa&s;s, God in no Sen&s;e willing it. This, I think, follows as an undeniable Con&s;equence from this Truth, That his Knowledge and Power are infinite, which I take for granted. As I cannot &s;ee how it is po&s;&s;ible that any Thing &s;hould come to pa&s;s, without the Knowledge of him, who&s;e Under&s;tanding is infinite, and unlimited, &s;o I can no more conceive how any Thing can come to pa&s;s without the Will of him who&s;e Power is infinite, he knowing it at the Time when it was done, or about to be done: For &s;uppo&s;e it was not done or brought to pa&s;s by his own Efficiency, either immediate, or thro' the In&s;trumentality of &s;ome other Agents; yet at lea&s;t he could have hindred it by his mighty Power, which he would mo&s;t certainly have done, had he not willed its coming to pa&s;s, at lea&s;t by his <HI>per|mi&s;&s;ive</HI> Will. Now the Will of God that this or that Thing &s;hall come to pa&s;s, is what I under&s;tand by the Decree.</P>
<P N="2">2. Suppo&s;e it be granted, that God decrees &s;ome Things by a <HI>per|mi&s;&s;ive Decree</HI> only; and his Providence with Re&s;pect to this Accom|pli&s;hment be corre&s;pondent with &s;uch a Decree as that is; yet it mu&s;t be here ob&s;erved, that <HI>Permi&s;&s;ion</HI> in God mu&s;t not be looked upon as merely the not hindring an Event of which we may have an Idea in our Minds; for God does Nothing to hinder the Being of Millions of Worlds, which neither now exi&s;t, or ever &s;hall: But how ab&s;urd would it be to &s;ay, on this Account, he permits their Being. Per|mi&s;&s;ion in God therefore intends his not hindring Things from coming to pa&s;s, which he knows will come to pa&s;s, unle&s;s he hinders them. And thus divine Permi&s;&s;ion &s;uppo&s;eth God's doing more towards this
<PB N="158" REF="005439_0173_10183252610dcac0">
or that Thing's coming to pa&s;s, than barely permitting it in the Man|ner now expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>For, 3. He mu&s;t at lea&s;t be &s;uch a Cau&s;e of it, as without which &s;uch a Thing could not come to pa&s;s, ina&s;much as it never could have come to pa&s;s, had he not done &s;everal Things that were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order thereunto; as his making the Agents acting, and giv|ing them Power to act, and exhibiting the Objects about which the Act is conver&s;ant, and providentially ordering the Occa&s;ions leading to it, and giving that Aid to the Agents, without which they could not do what is done by them: <HI>For in him we live, move and have our Being,</HI> Acts 17.28. Now all this &s;uppo&s;eth that God hath from Eternity decreed thus to do: For whatever God does in Time, he decreed to do from Eternity; and this is much more than barely not hindring a free Agent from doing this or that Act.</P>
<P N="4">4. From God's permitting free Agents thus to act, the Things in this Way brought to pa&s;s, will as certainly have a Being as if God decreed to bring them about by a po&s;itive Act of his Power. For if he him&s;elf does, or decrees to do all that is nece&s;&s;ary in order to their Futurition, giving his Creatures all the Power and Aid that is nece&s;&s;a|ry thereunto, admini&s;tring al&s;o the Occa&s;ions leading to &s;uch Actions or Events, when he knows that his Creatures being put into &s;uch a State, and then left to their own free Will, will a&s;&s;uredly act after &s;uch a Manner; he does by Con&s;equence will or decree &s;uch Actions or Events, as they, not he, are the immediate Efficients and formal Cau&s;es of. I &s;ay, he that wills to do that on which he certainly knows &s;uch an Event will follow, does by Con&s;equence will that Event, tho' he him&s;elf neither does the Thing, nor is properly the Cau&s;e of ano|thers doing it; and tho' the Agent by whom &s;uch an Action is done, or &s;uch an Effect produced, be at perfect Liberty whether he will do &s;o or not. In this Ca&s;e the Event will a&s;&s;uredly happen, or the Effect be produced, as if the Agent acting had no Liberty; becau&s;e God has de|termined to do, and actually does, that which he knows will be an Occa&s;ion (not Cau&s;e) of that Agent's &s;o acting.</P>
<P>The certain Futurition of any Events thus nece&s;&s;arily, or rather certainly, con&s;equent on God's permi&s;&s;ive Decree, relating to them, does not at all infer a Want of Power or Liberty in the Agents imme|diately concerned in them, of not acting as they do. If God decrees to do that, on which he knows &s;uch an Event will follow, that is, That his Creature having Power &s;o to act, will of its own Accord do
<PB N="159" REF="005439_0174_101832a61aa73630">
&s;o, the Con&s;equence of this is not, that his Creature has not Power to do otherwi&s;e. I think this is as plain as any Thing can be. How &s;hould God's Decree to &s;uffer a free Agent to act after &s;uch a Manner, infer that Agent's not having Power to forbear &s;o acting?</P>
<P>If it be here &s;aid, that it is not po&s;&s;ible that even God him&s;elf &s;hould know what a free Agent will do in a Ca&s;e wherein he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have Power to do a Thing or not to do it; I an&s;wer, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> By a&s;k|ing him that &s;ays &s;o, How he knows this? Does he find any &s;uch Thing a&s;&s;erted in the holy Scriptures? Or will he &s;ay, That a Sup|po&s;ition of God's knowing what a free Agent will do, implies a Con|tradiction, and &s;o cannot be true. If this be what is intended, I de|clare my &s;elf very far from &s;eeing it to be evident. If a Creature may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have Power to do that which he does not; or on the other Hand, not to do that which he does; How does it appear that God, who&s;e Under&s;tanding is infinite, cannot know whether he will do the Thing or not do it? To &s;uppo&s;e, that God may know both that &s;uch a Creature will do &s;uch an Action, and that he will not do it, would indeed be a plain Contradiction: The Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e both the&s;e cannot be true: But to &s;uppo&s;e that God may know that &s;uch a Creature will do &s;uch an Action, tho' that Creature have Power not to do it, when it is a Truth that he will do it, even then when God is &s;uppo&s;ed to know it, has not, I think, any Appearance of a Contradiction in it.</P>
<P>It was always <HI>a Truth,</HI> even from Eternity, that Creatures by whom &s;uch and &s;uch Actions are done in Time, would &s;o do them. If it be true a Minute before a Creature performs an Action, that he will perform it; the &s;ame was true an Hour before that, and a Year before that and &s;o from Eternity: Or did this at any Time begin to be a <HI>Truth?</HI> Now, how can any Man affirm, that there may be a <HI>Truth</HI> which God may be, nay, mu&s;t needs be ignorant of? Let it al&s;o be con&s;idered, that if God cannot foreknow &s;uch Contingencies, then he cannot know of them one Hour before they come to pa&s;s. but thus to di&s;pute is to argue again&s;t plain Fact: For it is certain that God hath both fore-known and revealed many &s;uch Things long be|fore their Accompli&s;hment; as that of <HI>Cyrus</HI> his &s;ending the <HI>Jews</HI> back to their own Land; and that of <HI>Judas</HI>'s betraying his Lord and Ma&s;|ter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Or had not the&s;e Agents Power to forbear doing the&s;e Actions? I can &s;hew that Dr. TWISSE, who was no <HI>Arminian,</HI> affirms this with Re&s;pect to <HI>Judas,</HI> and &s;ays the &s;ame with Re&s;pect to Men's &s;inful Actions in general; yet he truly acknowledgeth that Men can|not
<PB N="160" REF="005439_0175_1018325487ab8040">
exerci&s;e Grace in their doing good Actions, or in their forbearing evil ones, till God be&s;tows his Grace upon them.</P>
<P>I think it appears plainly enough, by what has been &s;aid in &s;everal of the la&s;t foregoing Paragraphs, That the Sovereignty of God in decree|ing future Events, and bringing them to pa&s;s in the Way of his Provi|dence, is no Ways incon&s;i&s;tent with the Liberty of his Creatures.</P>
<P>And this I think well agreeth with the <HI>A&s;&s;embly of Divines,</HI> in their <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith,</HI> Chap. 5. Sect. 2.
<Q>Altho' in Relation to the Fore-knowledge and Decree of God, the fir&s;t Cau&s;e, all Things come to pa&s;s immutably, and infallibly; yet by the &s;ame Provi|dence he ordereth them to fall out according to the Nature of &s;e|cond Cau&s;es, either nece&s;&s;arily, freely or contingently.</Q>
Now this undoubtedly holds true with Re&s;pect to God's Decree and Pro|vidence relating to Man's eternal State, as well as with any other Thing what&s;oever.</P>
<P>I crave Leave in this Place to make a &s;hort Digre&s;&s;ion from what is the proper De&s;ign and Bu&s;ine&s;s of this E&s;&s;ay, which is not to defend tho&s;e <HI>calvinian</HI> Doctrines which I acknowledge, but to e&s;tabli&s;h my own Hy|pothe&s;is, in tho&s;e Articles, wherein I differ from mo&s;t that are in that Scheme.</P>
<P>But having in Page 154. acknowledged the Truth of the Doctrine of <HI>Reprobation,</HI> as well as that of <HI>Election</HI>; and being &s;en&s;ible how very ten|der many &s;erious Souls are, with Re&s;pect to the fir&s;t mentioned of the&s;e two Articles; I &s;hall attempt in a very few Words, to take off the &s;eem|ing Har&s;hne&s;s of the Doctrine which I have now named. But let tho&s;e who own the Doctrine of Election, as it is a&s;&s;erted in <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.4.5. and Ver&s;e 11. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.30. <HI>Acts</HI> 13.48. and many other Places: Let &s;uch, I &s;ay, as believe this Doctrine, con&s;ider how this can be true, and the other mentioned be fal&s;e. How can we &s;uppo&s;e it to be a Truth, that God chu&s;eth &s;ome of Mankind to eternal Life, and yet not leave the Re&s;t uncho&s;en? How can he be &s;aid to chu&s;e any, if he makes no Difference, but takes all? Now, if we acknowledge that God chu&s;eth &s;ome of Mankind from among the Re&s;t, to be the Ob|jects of his &s;pecial Favour, as in the Texts above quoted, this with what is plainly implied in it, and evidently held forth from it, contains the Sub&s;tance of what they hold, if I do not mi&s;under&s;tand them who maintain the Doctrine of which I am now &s;peaking: And I de&s;ire &s;uch as are willing to &s;ubmit to the Authority of God's holy Word, to con&s;ider whether as much as this is not plainly held forth in &s;uch Texts of Scripture as the&s;e, <HI>viz. Jude</HI> ver. 4. <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.7, 8. and Chap. 9.21, 22. Many &s;uch Texts might be ea&s;ily named.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="005439_0176_101832a7dbe9e790">And let it be con&s;idered that if God does, or ever will, inflict eter|nal Torment on any of the Children of Men, he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed al|ways to have intended to do &s;o; for we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that God ever did any Thing but what he fir&s;t purpo&s;ed or intended to do; nor can we rea&s;onably think, that God ever purpo&s;ed or intended to do any Thing, which he did not before purpo&s;e. Or can we think that any new Rea&s;ons can offer them&s;elves to God, which before he knew not of, to move him to purpo&s;e or decree Things which he never before in|tended to do, or intended &s;hould be done? I hope none have &s;o mean Tho'ts of God, as &s;uch an Imagination would imply! I &s;uppo&s;e it undeniable, that whatever God does in Time, he hath purpo&s;ed to do from Eternity.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame Rea&s;on that God does any Thing in Time, that is done by him, he always purpo&s;ed to do it. If therefore, God inflict|ing Pain or Torment on any of the Children of Men, he inflicteth the &s;ame for their Sins; then he eternally purpo&s;ing to inflict Pain or Torment on them, and always purpo&s;ed to do this for their Sins, or as a Ju&s;t Puni&s;hment of them.</P>
<P>But if any think it will from hence follow, that Men's Sins are the Cau&s;e of God's Decree to puni&s;h them, they are herein gro&s;ly mi&s;ta|ken: Sin is the Cau&s;e of Man's &s;uffering, and the Thing for which God intends he &s;hall &s;uffer; yet the &s;ame cannot be the Cau&s;e of God's Act in decreeing: The Rea&s;on of which is evident, <HI>viz.</HI> Be|cau&s;e the Decree of God, being an eternal and immunent Act of his, cannot be an Effect of any Thing out of him&s;elf; and mo&s;t evidently it cannot be an Effect of any Thing that is temporal, as Sin is: For how &s;hould a Thing that had no Being till very lately, be the Cau&s;e of a Thing that had a Being from Eternity. Of God's Actions of this Kind, the Perfections of his own Nature, &s;uch as his own perfect Knowledge, Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, Holine&s;s, which belong to his eternal Power and God-head, can only be the Cau&s;e, not the temporary Actions of his Creatures.</P>
<P>What God may ju&s;tly do in Time, he may ju&s;tly decree to do from Eternity. If God does nothing in the Execution of his Decrees, which is unju&s;t, he does no Inju&s;tice in decreeing: Or can we ima|gine that God does unju&s;tly in decreeing to do ju&s;tly? This would be &s;trange! Indeed God's eternal Decree does not of it&s;elf any Ways af|fect any of his Creatures. His Decree does not of it&s;elf either give them a Being, or work any Effects on them. This is only done by his Efficiency and Providence. If therefore, in and by the&s;e, he does

his Creatures no Wrong&punc; he never does them any at all. If God deals fairly by his Creatures in all his Works, or providential Di&s;pen&s;ations towards them, they ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have no Rea&s;on to complain of him as if <HI>his Way was not equal.</HI> When therefore God ju&s;tifies him&s;elf again&s;t all the hard Thoughts and wicked Cavils of &s;inful Men, the Cour&s;e he takes is to &s;hew the Ju&s;tice and Equity of all his Actions towards them, and is not wont to di&s;pute with them concerning his eternal Decrees. See the&s;e following Texts and others like them, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.25,&mdash;29. <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.33,&mdash;36. <HI>Job</HI> 34.11, 12, 23, 24.</P>
<P>Tho' it be true, that God does nothing but what he fir&s;t decrees to do, and this even from Eternity; and as true that God decrees to do nothing but what he does, and that in the very &s;ame Manner in which he decreed to do it; yet no In&s;tances can be given of God's doing any Thing that is unju&s;t or unequal in the Execution of his Decrees. He manages all Things in &s;uch a Manner, that Man has not the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to complain of him. That is mo&s;t true concerning him, in Deut. 32.4, <HI>He is the Rock, his Work is perfect: For all his Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s are Judgment: A God of Truth and without Iniquity, ju&s;t and right is he.</HI></P>
<P>As God neither will, nor ever de&s;igned to torment Men in another Life, &s;ave for their Sins, whereby they well de&s;erve the &s;ame; &s;o he never is, nor intended to be, the Cau&s;e of tho&s;e Sins for which he re|&s;olved to puni&s;h tho&s;e who he ever knew would de&s;erve it. If God &s;hould him&s;elf cau&s;e Men to commit Sin, it would not &s;tand with his Ju&s;tice to puni&s;h them for it. But no Man can prove, that God was ever the Author of any Sin. To affirm he ever was, is to bla&s;|pheme his holy Name. If any have let fall Expre&s;&s;ions implying that God is the Author of Sin, they have certainly erred therein: And they who accu&s;e Men with this (as I think, is frequent) when they are not guilty of it, are guilty of grievou&s;ly wronging them.</P>
<P>They who affirm, That God has from Eternity <HI>decreed</HI> to <HI>permit</HI> tho&s;e Sins to be committed, which he certainly knew would be com|mitted, if he prevented them not, and that he accordingly does per|mit them, do not hereby make him the <HI>Author</HI> of Sin.

No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in God in Ju&s;tice obliged to exert his Power in hindring Per&s;ons from &s;inning, tho' he knows they will Sin if he does not, and that their Sinning will bring Ruin on them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. That Per&s;ons who have long re&s;i&s;ted and quenched the Holy Spirit, and &s;o provoked him to depart from them, may at la&s;t &s;eek earne&s;tly for Mercy, and not obtain it, no Argument again&s;t what I plead for.</HEAD>
<P>_THAT Sinners are often guilty of re&s;i&s;ting and quenching the Holy Spirit of God, and this for a long Time, is here taken for granted; and it is a Truth unto which what was &s;poken by the holy Martyr <HI>Stephen,</HI> in <HI>Acts</HI> 7.51. is a very clear Te&s;ti|mony: <HI>Ye &s;tiff-necked and uncircumci&s;ed in Heart and Ears, ye do always re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t: As your Fathers did, &s;o do y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> That in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 63.10. is to the &s;ame Pur|po&s;e; <HI>but they have rebelled and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d his Holy Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. Al&s;o that
<PB N="164" REF="005439_0179_1018325e6deb6ab8">
in 1 The&s;. 5.17. <HI>Quench not the Spirit,</HI> implies in it the Truth here taken for granted; and there are a great Number of other Texts in which the &s;ame Truth is implied.</P>
<P>Now, in all &s;uch Texts as the&s;e, the <HI>Striving</HI> of the Holy Spirit with Sinners is evidently &s;uppo&s;ed, even the &s;ame that is expre&s;ly mentioned, Gen. 6.3. <HI>My Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with Man.</HI> Sinners could not re&s;i&s;t the Holy Spirit, if he did not &s;trive with them, or were not engaged in &s;ome De&s;ign or Work wherein they might be &s;uppo&s;ed to oppo&s;e or re&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>Now, this Operation or Striving of the Spirit, in which Sinners act in Oppo&s;ition to him, cannot be ju&s;tly conceived to be a Striving in the proper and literal Sen&s;e of the Word, which implies, a Per&s;on's doing all that is in his Power to accompli&s;h a Work, wherein he is engaged; for this is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the infinite Power of the Holy Gho&s;t, who is One of the three Per&s;ons in the God-head: This mu&s;t, therefore, be attributed to the Spirit of God, after the Manner of Men, as Things are in Scripture frequently attributed to God. Thus, becau&s;e the Spirit of God does tho&s;e Things which have a na|tural Tendency towards their Conver&s;ion and eternal Salvation, he is &s;aid to &s;trive with them to that End, tho' he does not all that is in his Power; which, were he a Man or &s;ome other created Agent, he might be &s;uppo&s;ed to do, if he were re&s;i&s;ted, and did not accompli&s;h what he attempted.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve, that the immediate <HI>End</HI> of this Operation of the Spirit, wherein he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be re&s;i&s;ted, and many Times effectually, &s;o that he accompli&s;heth not what he attempteth, cannot be the <HI>Regeneration</HI> of the Per&s;ons he is &s;aid to &s;trive with; for this being a Work, to which the infinite Power of God is required, like that by which he wrought in Chri&s;t when he rai&s;ed him from the Dead, &s;uch a Power mu&s;t needs be exerted, whenever this Work is attempted; and then there can be no Re&s;i&s;tance given to the Holy Spirit therein. The Holy Spirit never fails of accompli&s;hing this, when he &s;ets about it: As the Soul is wholly <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> in it, &s;o it can make no Re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t it. When the Spirit works in this Way, none can hinder.</P>
<P>The Work, therefore, of the Holy Spirit which Sinners are &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t and to prevent, is a Work of quite a different Nature from that but now mentioned: A Work in which the Spirit of God acts in a <HI>moral,</HI> not in a <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> Way (if I may u&s;e the&s;e Terms) I mean he works in the Way of <HI>moral Sua&s;ion,</HI> by offering Matter of Con|viction
<PB N="165" REF="005439_0180_101832b2151b2ed8">
and Awakening to tho&s;e he is &s;aid to &s;trive with. He &s;ets proper Arguments and Motives before them, and inculcates the &s;ame upon their Mind and Con&s;cience, to per&s;uade and excite them to apply them&s;elves to the Things wherein their everla&s;ting Peace and Welfare is concerned. He u&s;eth Means to remove their Prejudices again&s;t the Things which he per&s;uades them to, and to &s;tir them up to improve the Powers which they have latent in them, but &s;eem as if they had not, and will never exert, unle&s;s they be in this Way a&s;&s;i&s;ted. This, I &s;ay, is the Way of the Spirit's Working, when he &s;trives with Sin|ners in order to their Good. And thus he &s;trives with them in a Way, unto the Succe&s;s of which their own Concurrence and Activity are required; which to the Act of <HI>Regeneration</HI> it is not; tho' in the Work <HI>preparatory</HI> to this it is.</P>
<P>Now, in the Spirit's Striving here intended, I do not &s;uppo&s;e what he does by the written and preached Word, only to be included; but doubt not that he al&s;o &s;trives with Sinners by in&s;tructive and convin|cing Providences, and &s;ometimes by the Mini&s;try of his holy Angels, and immediate Sugge&s;tions; by all which Means, Things are bro't to the Minds of &s;inful Men, which tend to in&s;truct and excite them to their Duty: But &s;till this is &s;triving with them in a moral Way; not by attempting to create new Powers in them, which they are without. And if the Striving of the Holy Spirit be in the Way now expre&s;&s;ed, it is ea&s;y to conceive how he may be refu&s;ed by &s;inful Men, and his De&s;ign and Work fru&s;trated; becau&s;e Per&s;ua&s;ions, properly &s;uch, &s;uppo&s;e a Power in the Subjects per&s;uaded, either to do or not do the Things they are per&s;uaded to: For to what End is a Per&s;on per&s;uaded to do that which he is &s;uppo&s;ed, either to have no Power to perform, or no Power to let alone; unle&s;s the Per&s;ua&s;ions u&s;ed are &s;uppo&s;ed to give him Power to do the Thing required? And then he is enabled to do it in a <HI>moral</HI> (not a phy&s;ical) Way, which I willingly allow, <HI>i. e.</HI> he is excited and made willing to do that which he had Power before (in a phy&s;ical Sen&s;e) to perform; but never would have performed (and in the Sen&s;e explained could not) without &s;uch Per|&s;ua&s;ions. Thus have I &s;hewed what that Striving of the Spirit of God is, which Sinners are here &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t and quench.</P>
<P>I &s;hall proceed to con&s;ider <HI>how</HI> &s;inful Men <HI>re&s;i&s;t</HI> and <HI>quench</HI> the Spirit, in the&s;e Operations. And here I &s;hall briefly name &s;ome of the principal Ways in which this is done. And,</P>
<P N="1">(1) Sinners re&s;i&s;t and quench the Spirit when they will not hearken and attend to what he &s;ays to them. All that God &s;ays to &s;inful Men
<PB N="166" REF="005439_0181_101832618f3c7f58">
in his written and preached Word, by the Voice of his Providence, and by the Mini&s;try of his Angels; by all which they are put in Re|membrance of their many Sins, and the Duties required of them; all the&s;e, I &s;ay, are the Voice of the Holy Spirit to them, unto whom the Application of Redemption mo&s;t e&s;pecially belongs. Now, when Sinners refu&s;e to hear and con&s;ider what the Holy Spirit does in the&s;e Ways &s;ay to them, this is evidently to re&s;i&s;t and quench him. By thus refu&s;ing to hear the Voice of the Holy Spirit, Sinners refu&s;e to receive Influences and Convictions, the giving of which is the &s;pecial End of the Spirit's being &s;ent into the World to them, as appears in <HI>John</HI> 16. and 30.</P>
<P N="2">(2) Sinners re&s;i&s;t the Spirit of God in their Refu&s;al of the Offers of his Mercy made to them, thro' a Redeemer, by <HI>neglecting the great Salvation</HI> offered to them, as in <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.3. The Application of that Redemption which has been purcha&s;ed for &s;inful Men, does e&s;pecially belong to the Holy Spirit, as his Work; and to this End he labours with Sinners to prepare and qualify them to be Partakers of it, and make them willing to go to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for the Benefits offered to them: He calls, invites and per&s;uades them to do &s;o. Now, when they refu&s;e to obey the&s;e Calls, they in this, in a very e&s;pecial Man|ner, re&s;i&s;t and quench the Holy Spirit of God. This e&s;pecially was the Sin with which the <HI>Jews</HI> were charged. John 5.40. <HI>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</HI> The like we have in <HI>Matth.</HI> 23.37. The &s;ame Sin is called a <HI>doing De&s;pite to the Spirit of Grace</HI>: Becau&s;e the Tendency of the Influences of the Holy Spirit, in the Work of common Grace, is to bring Sinners to an Acceptance of the Saviour, and Salvation offered to them, in which Work of his, they wickedly re&s;i&s;t him. See <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.29.</P>
<P>Sinners may e&s;pecially be looked upon as Re&s;i&s;ters of the Holy Spirit, in this Work of his, when they fall away after he has wrought a very con&s;iderable Change on them, has actually done a great deal for them, in order to their being made Partakers of the &s;pecial Mer|cies offered to them in the new Covenant, and &s;o brought them very <HI>nigh to the Kingdom of God,</HI> as that Scribe was, <HI>Mark</HI> 12.34. This I take to be the very Ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.24, 26. and <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4, 5, 6. and 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.20. and in <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.38, 39. which Places I only here refer my Reader to.</P>
<P>But mo&s;t of all do Sinners re&s;i&s;t and quench the Spirit of God, when the Oppo&s;ition which they give to him and his Work, is with
<PB N="167" REF="005439_0182_101832b78a3aaae8">
an Intent to reproach and di&s;honour him, and the gracious De&s;ign wherein he is engaged. This &s;eems to be the Crime (or the great Aggravation of the Crime) of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, when they &s;aid, <HI>Doth not this Fellow,</HI> (meaning our Lord) <HI>ca&s;t out Devils by</HI> Beelzebub <HI>the Prince of Devils?</HI> Matth. 12.24. And &s;o in <HI>Mark</HI> 3.22. it is &s;aid, <HI>The Scribe which came down from</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>&s;aid, He hath</HI> Beelzebub, <HI>and by the Prince of the Devils ca&s;teth he out De|vils.</HI> And the Bla&s;phemy, for which they are &s;poken of as in Dan|ger of eternal Damnation, is thus de&s;cribed in Ver&s;e 30. <HI>Becau&s;e, &s;aid they, he hath an unclean Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3) Sinners re&s;i&s;t the Holy Spirit by ob&s;tinately rebelling again&s;t him, and refu&s;ing to do what he requires of them. Of Sinners thus re&s;i&s;ting the Spirit of God we have an Account in &s;uch Texts of Scripture as I&s;ai. 63.10. <HI>But they rebelled, and vexed his Holy Spirit: Therefore he was turned to be their Enemy, and fought again&s;t them.</HI> Jer. 2.25. and Chap. 44.16. <HI>As for the Word thou ha&s;t &s;poken unto us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>E&s;pecially when Per&s;ons &s;in again&s;t Light and Knowledge, they are guilty of re&s;i&s;ting and quenching the Spirit of God. When if notwith&s;tanding Men are by the Holy Spirit convinced, that &s;uch and &s;uch Actions are evil and provoking in God's Sight, yet they will do them, in this they greatly &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t. Of this Kind of Sin our Saviour &s;peaketh, John 15.22. <HI>If I had not come and &s;poken unto them, they had not had Sin: But now they have no Cloak for their Sins.</HI></P>
<P>And now that the Spirit of God does &s;ometimes utterly withdraw from Per&s;ons who have long re&s;i&s;ted him in the In&s;tances above ex|pre&s;&s;ed, is what I am here next to &s;hew; and the &s;ame is mo&s;t mani|fe&s;tly held forth in Gen. 6.3. <HI>And the Lord &s;aid, My Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with Man, for that he al&s;o is Fle&s;h.</HI> Which Words are well explained by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle, Chap. 3. Ver. 18, 19, 20. <HI>For Chri&s;t al&s;o hath once &s;uffered for Sins, the Ju&s;t for the Unju&s;t, (that he might bring us to God) being put to Death in the Fle&s;h, but quickned by the Spirit: By which al&s;o he went and preached unto the Spirits in Pri&s;on; which &s;ometime were di&s;obedient, when once the Long-&s;uffering of God waited in the Days of</HI> Noah, <HI>while the Ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is eight, Souls were &s;aved by Water.</HI> Thus the Spirit of God departed from <HI>Saul,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 16.14. And thus <HI>David</HI> prayed, that the holy Spirit of God might not be taken
<PB N="168" REF="005439_0183_10183263a7461b90">
from him, when probably he tho't him&s;elf unconverted: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.11. As for God's true Saints, he hath promi&s;ed that he will never take his holy Spirit from them. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 59.20, 21. <HI>Jer.</HI> 32.38, 39, 40.</P>
<P>There are other Texts of Scripture, wherein the final Withdraw|ing of the Spirit of God from &s;ome, who long re&s;i&s;t and rebel again&s;t him, is very evidently implied: Such as that, P&s;al. 81.11, 12. <HI>But my People would not hearken to my Voice: And</HI> I&s;rael <HI>would none of me. So I gave them up unto their own Hearts Lu&s;ts: And they walked in their own Coun&s;els.</HI> With this Place compare the&s;e following, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28.9. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.2. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 24.13. <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.11. When God wholly and forever gives up any Sinners to their own Heart's Lu&s;ts, re&s;olving that he will let them follow the Devices and Coun&s;els of their own wicked Hearts, his thus taking his Spirit forever from them, is therein mo&s;t evidently implied: And what the dreadful Con&s;equences of this are, comes next in order to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Now, when God deals thus with any of the rebellious Children of Men, they are undone, and that forever: It is then impo&s;&s;ible to <HI>re|new them again to Repentance,</HI> as in <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.6. When the Spirit of God has utterly for&s;aken them, there then <HI>remains no more Sacrifice for their Sins</HI>; they having <HI>trodden under Foot the Blood of the Son of God,</HI> and therein <HI>done De&s;pite to the Spirit of Grace,</HI> as in <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.26,&mdash;29. This is a <HI>Sin unto Death,</HI> which we are required to pray for the Pardon of. It is impo&s;&s;ible that the Sin of &s;uch Per&s;ons &s;hould ever be pardoned: And at pre&s;ent I &s;ee no Rea&s;on but that it may be the &s;ame <HI>Sin again&s;t the holy Gho&s;t,</HI> that is &s;poken of in Matth. 12. and <HI>Mark.</HI> 3. I &s;uppo&s;e the Sin in tho&s;e Places intended, to con&s;i&s;t no le&s;s in the Enmity of Men's Hearts again&s;t the holy Spirit, and the Work he is engaged in, and the Re&s;i&s;tance they give to him in it, than in the Words they utter again&s;t him: And I am far from agreeing with a certain Author, who thinks the Sin intended in the&s;e Places cannot be committed without Men's pronouncing tho&s;e bla&s;phemous Words here &s;poken of. Perhaps &s;uch malicious Speeches are rather to be looked upon as a plain Indication of the Per&s;ons guilty of the horrendous Crime, by our Saviour pronounced unpardonable, than as that, in which the intended Sin does either wholly or principally con|&s;i&s;t. And if this be the Truth of the Ca&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e none can be known by others to have committed the mentioned Sin, except &s;uch Bla&s;phemers as our Saviour de&s;cribes: And I believe that Sinners can|not ordinarily in this Life know that they have &s;inned unpardonably.
<PB N="169" REF="005439_0184_101832ba73612708">
In this, I think, I well agree with the Learned Mr. How, in his <HI>Re|deemer's Tears,</HI> which Book I have not now by me.</P>
<P>Indeed none have committed that Sin which is unpardonable, but tho&s;e from whom the Spirit has finally withdrawn him&s;elf, or is about &s;o to do; and it is certain, that all &s;uch are guilty of an unpardonable Sin: And the Rea&s;on why it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch Sinners &s;hould ever obtain a Pardon, is, becau&s;e the Spirit of God has utterly for&s;aken them, and will never return to them again; and on this Account it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould ever be <HI>renewed again to Repentance,</HI> as in <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.6. In which Clau&s;e it is implied, that they once had a <HI>Repentance</HI> which they have lo&s;t, and fallen from, but not of the &s;ame Kind which the Regenerate only have; for tho&s;e who have that never fall away, as tho&s;e do &s;poken of in the Place referred to, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.6. Nor can Per&s;ons be &s;uch Apo&s;tates in whom common Grace, which implies Repentance of a lower Kind than that of the Regenerate, has never been wrought. But the Spirit does not bring all with whom he &s;trives unto this Length, which is the &s;ame with that de&s;cribed, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.20. without attaining unto which Per&s;ons may provoke the Spirit of God to leave them: But I think that ordinarily &s;uch cannot know that the Spirit of God will no more &s;trive with them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall have fini&s;hed this Chapter, when I have &s;aid, That its being a Truth, that the Spirit of God having been long re&s;i&s;t|ed by wicked Men, may at la&s;t thus leave them (as is in many Scriptures implied) &s;o that hereupon their De&s;truction is un|avoidable, can be no Evidence that before this they could not comply with the Terms of the new Covenant. If now they are given up to their own Heart's Lu&s;ts, &s;o that they cannot do this, it followeth not that they could never have done it. If now <HI>the Things of their Peace are hidden from their Eyes,</HI> it does not thence appear, that they always were &s;o; nay, the contrary is plainly implied in the Words alluded to. If now God will not hear their Cries to him for Mercy, as in <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.24. it followeth not, that he never would have heard them, if they would have called on him: The contrary is plainly implied in the Place quoted. If Sinners will not <HI>&s;eek the Lord while he may be found,</HI> and <HI>call upon him while he is near</HI>; no Wonder if he will not hear their Cries, when the Day of his Patience is at an End. Nor can Sinners &s;eek the Lord after their Day of Grace is ended, as they might have done, while he was &s;triving with them by his Word and Spirit. They now, indeed, cry for Deliverance when they feel the <HI>Terrors</HI> of the Almighty &s;eizing on their Souls, as in <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.26, 27.
<PB N="170" REF="005439_0185_1018326725eaae28">
which Cries are nothing like the Prayers of Sinners, tho' unregene|rate, while under &s;en&s;ible <HI>Encouragements</HI> from the Invitations of the Go&s;pel, and while God &s;ays to them, as in 2 Cor. 6.2. <HI>Now is the accepted Time; now is the Day of Salvation.</HI> After the Door of God's Mercy is &s;hut (tho' here in this World) Sinner's Cries for Deliverance from the Torments which they may &s;uffer, are of the &s;ame Kind with tho&s;e of the Wicked after this Life is at an End, <HI>Luke</HI> 13.25, 26. and <HI>Matth.</HI> 25.10, 11.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. Wherein the Power of Man, with Relation to the Condition on which Salvation is offered to him in the Go&s;pel, is further con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>_THO' my Tho'ts with Re&s;pect to the Point here propo|&s;ed to further Con&s;ideration, have, I hope, been in &s;ome tolerable Mea&s;ure manife&s;ted, &s;o that I tho't not to have added any Thing further; yet that I may not fail of being under&s;tood, with Re&s;pect to this important Article, I &s;hall endeavour more fully to explain and confirm what I hold.</P>
<P>I think I have &s;ufficiently proved in Part II. Chap. V. of this E&s;&s;ay, that neither the Grace of Regeneration, nor any Act implying it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered in the Go&s;pel; and con&s;equently if Salvation be conditionally offered, as I have &s;hewed it is, Part I. Chap. IV. the Condition required is not performed by Virtue of any Power received in our Regeneration, that, in Order of Nature, following our Faith and Ju&s;tification. It is therefore here &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Power by which any Sinner <HI>believeth unto Righteou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI> as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.10. be that Power what it will, and however the Sinner comes by it, is &s;uch a Power as the Sinner may, and mu&s;t have before he is <HI>born again,</HI> or <HI>born of the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is there any Doubt here, whether this Power is given to Man by God, <HI>from whom every good and perfect Gift cometh down,</HI> Jam. 1.
<PB N="171" REF="005439_0186_101832bdb2a64b18">
17. tho' it may be very rea&s;onably enquired in what Way and Man|ner God gives this Power, and whether he gives it only to &s;uch as when they have it u&s;e it well, and &s;o actually comply with the Terms on which Salvation is offered to them.</P>
<P>That Sinners may have Power to do that which is never actually done by them, I know not of any that will deny, with whom I am any Ways likely to be concerned. I &s;hall therefore take it for gran|ted, That it is po&s;&s;ible for Per&s;ons to do &s;ome Things which it is in their Power to avoid; and al&s;o not to do &s;ome Things which they have the Power to perform.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion therefore here is only re&s;pecting the Power of per|forming the Condition on which Salvation is offered to Sinners; and this Inquiry can only here relate to tho&s;e Sinners that never accept of Salvation on the Terms of the new Covenant; for as for &s;uch as do ac|cept of it, they certainly have a Power &s;ome Way or other to do &s;o.</P>
<P>I &s;hall then here enquire, whether &s;uch as will not, and &s;o do not, come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for Life, in the Manner required of them in or|der to their being &s;aved, do fail of doing this for want of a Power ne|ce&s;&s;ary to that End. And let it be remembred that I here &s;peak of &s;uch only as enjoy the Means of Salvation, the Grace of God &s;poken of in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.1. And the Que&s;tion here is not, whether Sinners can <HI>believe to the &s;aving of their Souls,</HI> without Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance from God; but whether they might not do &s;o, having &s;uch Means and Helps as many have, who yet never comply with the Terms of the Go&s;pel, and &s;o peri&s;h for ever.</P>
<P>Nor do I by that Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance which I &s;uppo&s;e nece&s;&s;ary in this Ca&s;e, intend &s;uch only as con&s;i&s;t in external Means; as the Word of God written and preached, the Sacraments of Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper, in&s;tructive and awakening Providences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But be|&s;ides the&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e there is nece&s;&s;ary unto a Sinner's doing what is required of him in the Go&s;pel, the Aids and Influences of God's holy Spirit to move and excite him to the Things required of him, by bring|ing his Duty to his Remembrance, and his Obligations to perform it; al&s;o by putting him in Mind of his Sins and the Calls given him in the Word of God to repent of them, and turn from them, and lay hold on the great Saviour provided for him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="005439_0187_1018326a6ca1bc48">The&s;e Motions and Influences of the holy Spirit, have all of them a Relation to the Things required of Man in the holy Scriptures, and not to Things which are not therein pre&s;cribed; and are intended by the <HI>Strivings of God's Spirit,</HI> of which we read, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3. and which the Wicked <HI>re&s;i&s;t (Acts</HI> 7.31.) and <HI>quench,</HI> (1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 5.19.) and whom they are &s;aid in &s;o doing to <HI>vex</HI> and <HI>grieve, I&s;ai.</HI> 63.10. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.30.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Motions and Influences of the holy Spirit which I here &s;peak of, I confe&s;s I conceive he acts in a moral, rather than a phy&s;ical Manner, <HI>viz.</HI> by in&s;tructing, reproving, exhorting, and per&s;uading, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and not by creating any new Powers in Men's Souls; but by doing what is nece&s;&s;ary on his Part in order to his moving and excit|ing Men to the Performance of their Duty; and &s;o rendring them the more inexcu&s;able if they engage not in it.</P>
<P>However the&s;e Motions of the Spirit being &s;uch as Per&s;ons may en|joy, and yet never be &s;avingly converted, they are quite of a different Nature from tho&s;e Operations of the Spirit of God, by which the great Work of Regeneration is effected, nor are they de&s;igned to the &s;ame End as the&s;e la&s;t mentioned are; but to excite Sinners to the Duties that are preparatory to a Work of &s;aving Grace on their Souls, a Work <HI>like that which was wrought in Chri&s;t, when God rai&s;ed him from the Dead,</HI> (Eph. 1.20.) and by which we are &s;aid to be <HI>created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works,</HI> Eph. 2.10.</P>
<P>Now the great Que&s;tion here is, Whether when Sinners are under &s;uch a Work of God's Spirit, with the external Means afforded to &s;uch as enjoy the Go&s;pel, and yet do not come to Chri&s;t for Life; whether, I &s;ay, the&s;e remain, being under &s;uch Advantages, without any Power to believe to the &s;aving of their Souls?</P>
<P>Now if this be affirmed by any, I confe&s;s I cannot agree with them in their Sentiments.</P>
<P>But for preventing Mi&s;takes in this important Article, I &s;hall here di&s;tingui&s;h of Impotency, which is two-fold; and each of the&s;e Kinds does &s;uppo&s;e there may be a Power oppo&s;ite to it. The Kinds of Impotency I here intend are by &s;ome, if I mi&s;take not, called <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral.</HI> I &s;hall &s;peak of the&s;e two Kinds of Impotence according to the Notion I my &s;elf have of them.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="005439_0188_1018106f4e5ac630">And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> By what I call a natural Impotence, I intend &s;uch an In|ability to do a Thing, as renders the Thing utterly impo&s;&s;ible to be done by a Per&s;on without having a new Power or Powers given to him. Thus it is properly &s;aid of a blind Man, that he cannot &s;ee; and of a deaf Man, that he cannot hear: And thus I acknowledge that it may be truly &s;aid of a Per&s;on in a State of Nature; not being born of the Spirit, that he cannot perform any Actions that are truly &s;piri|tual or holy. This is as impo&s;&s;ible as it is for a <HI>Thorn-Bu&s;h</HI> to bear <HI>Figs,</HI> or for a <HI>Bramble-Bu&s;h</HI> to bear <HI>Grapes, Luke</HI> 6.44. Nothing le&s;s than changing the Nature of a Tree will render it capable of this. And thus he that is utterly de&s;titute of &s;aving Grace, cannot bring forth any Fruits of Holine&s;s, till he is &s;avingly renewed and made a new Creature, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.10. No Arguments, Motives, or Per&s;ua&s;ions can give Power to a Man in this Sen&s;e unable to do a Thing, to per|form it.</P>
<P>But then, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> There is another Kind of Impotency, which ari&s;es only from Error in Men's Judgments, and Ob&s;tinacy in their Wills; and this does in &s;ome Sort di&s;able Per&s;ons from doing &s;ome Things which otherwi&s;e they might do, were their Prejudices removed. However it may not be unfitly &s;aid of Per&s;ons under &s;uch Di&s;advanta|ges, that they cannot for the pre&s;ent do this or that Thing, which they have an Aver&s;ion to, when yet &s;uch Per&s;ons want not a natural Power to perform what they are &s;aid to be unable to do. Thus when a Man is per&s;uaded that his doing this or that which he is urged to, will prove hurtful and injurious to him, it may be &s;aid, that at pre&s;ent he cannot do it, <HI>i. e.</HI> he cannot find in his Heart a Willingne&s;s to engage in doing that which he thinks will rather hurt him than do him good: Or if he thinks he might obtain &s;ome Benefit by doing the Thing, yet thinks the Advantages he might reap by it will not countervail the Difficulties he mu&s;t undergo in that Self-denial which is requi&s;ite in order to it, he cannot bring him&s;elf to a Willingne&s;s to do it.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons are in Scripture in this Sen&s;e &s;ometimes &s;poken of as unable to do this, that or the other Thing, which yet really they want not a natural Power to perform. Thus it is &s;aid of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Brethren, that <HI>they hated him &s;o, that they could not &s;peak peaceably of him,</HI> (Gen. 37.4.) Such Impotence as this is plainly &s;poken of by our Saviour, and the Nature of it unfolded in Luke 11.5, 6 7, 8. <HI>He &s;aid unto them, Which of you &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a Friend, and &s;hall g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unto him at Midnight, and &s;hall &s;ay unto him, Friend, Land me three Leaves; for a Friend of mine is come to me, and I have nothing to &s;et before him: And he from within

&s;hall an&s;wer, and &s;ay, Trouble me not; the Door is now &s;hut, and my Children are with me in Bed; I cannot ri&s;e to give thee.

And this which he would not, he is by and by &s;uppo&s;ed to do. The &s;ame Kind of Impotency is pleaded in Excu&s;e for not going to the great Go&s;pel-Fea&s;t, Luke 14.20. <HI>I have married a Wife, and therefore I cannot come.</HI> And our Saviour him&s;elf acknowledges this Sort of Impotency in &s;ome Men with Re&s;pect to their believing in him, John 5.44. <HI>How can ye be|lieve which receive Honour one of another, and &s;eek not the Honour that cometh from God only?</HI> This Kind of Impotency is not an ab&s;olute and utter Inability to do the Thing which Men are &s;ometimes &s;aid to be unable to do. This is often made evident by Per&s;ons actually doing what they have alledged them&s;elves to have no Power fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Their <HI>could not,</HI> being indeed no more than this, that they <HI>would not,</HI> and not their being utterly unable to do the Thing intended. This is a Sort of <HI>Cannot</HI> which may be cured by good In&s;tructions and Arguments which yet properly give no new Power; and Men may help them|&s;elves again&s;t this Sort of Inability by rea&s;oning them&s;elves out of their Prejudices again&s;t the Things, which they and others may imagine they have no Power to do; &s;o that they may &s;ee it was not Want of Power, but Want of a Will, that hindred them from doing as they &s;hould.</P>
<P>In the Sen&s;e now explained I acknowledge, that &s;ome cannot come to Chri&s;t for Life, and never will, except the Father draw them, as in <HI>John</HI> 6.44. But then our Lord him&s;elf &s;hews wherein this Ina|bility con&s;i&s;ts. John 5.40. <HI>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life</HI>; and Matth. 23.37. <HI>How often would I have gathered thy Chil|dren together, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not.</HI> It would, in my Opinion, be very improper to charge Men's not coming to Chri&s;t merely on their wilful Rebellion, if a real Inability were the Cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>If it be here &s;aid to be true of all that do not come to Chri&s;t for Life, that, in a &s;trict and proper Sen&s;e, they have no Power &s;o to do. I mu&s;t crave Leave to di&s;&s;ent from this, 'till I can &s;ee otherwi&s;e than at pre&s;ent I can do.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="005439_0190_101832c1145d12e0">And I &s;hall only here in&s;i&s;t a little more fully on one Argument again&s;t what I here oppo&s;e. I de&s;ire to know what Kindne&s;s it is to any Sinner, that he has an Offer of Salvation made to him in the Go&s;pel, if he have no Power given to him to accept of that Offer. What Kindne&s;s is it to a Per&s;on that he has Tidings of a Saviour, and is pro|mi&s;ed that he &s;hall be &s;aved by him, on this Condition that he be|lieveth on him, when, this notwith&s;tanding, God never did nor ever will give him any Power to believe? E&s;pecially &s;uppo&s;ing that if he does not believe, he &s;hall be puni&s;hed with a much &s;orer Puni&s;hment than he &s;hould have been, if he had never had an Offer of eternal Life made to him; which will be the Ca&s;e of &s;uch as enjoy the Go&s;pel, and yet do not believe, <HI>Matth.</HI> 10.15. I confe&s;s I think that God is much more merciful unto &s;uch as never have any Offer of Life, than he is to tho&s;e who have an Offer on &s;uch Terms.</P>
<P>And yet is it not a Truth, that all who enjoy the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, &s;everally con&s;idered, are bound to ble&s;s God that he has &s;ent his Son into the World to redeem them, and &s;ent his Go&s;pel to invite them to believe in him, that &s;o they may have eternal Life thro' him? If it be &s;aid, that no Man unto whom the Offer of Salvation is made does know any Thing to the contrary but that he is one of God's Elect, and &s;o &s;hall &s;ooner or later be enabled to believe on the Son of God, and obtain Life thro' his Name; I an&s;wer, that if he knew he was &s;o, he would be bound to prai&s;e God for &s;uch an invaluable Mercy; but &s;ince he does not know whether he is one of the&s;e or not, he does not know whether he have any Cau&s;e to give Thanks to God for the Offer of Salvation or no; and God does not re|quire us to give him Prai&s;e for &s;uppo&s;ed Favours, which we neither do nor can know we have received: Nay rather, to do this would be to mock him. And it &s;eems as if it would be to mock us, if he &s;hould make a great Shew of Kindne&s;s to us when he really &s;hews us no Favour, as indeed, according to the Principle oppo&s;ed, I affirm, he &s;hews none to tho&s;e unto whom he gives no Power to accept of the Mercy which he &s;eems graciou&s;ly to offer to them. But God forbid, that I &s;hould have any &s;uch hard Thoughts of him, as to think that he offers Salvation to Sinners, and threatens them with a double Damnation in Ca&s;e they perform not the Condition on which that Offer is made; and yet neither gives nor offers them any Power by which they may perform the Condition of that (to all Appearance) mo&s;t gracious Offer.</P>
<P>If it be here demanded, what Mercy it is in God to make an Offer of eternal Life to &s;uch Sinners as he certainly knows will never accept
<PB N="176" REF="005439_0191_1018327273418178">
of it; but will, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch an Offer, peri&s;h forever: To this I an&s;wer, that the Kindne&s;s of God in the Offers which he makes of his everla&s;ting Mercies, mu&s;t be judged of according to the Nature of the Condition on which he offers them, and not according to the Events following &s;uch Offers, and his Knowledge of tho&s;e Events. What if Sinners never accept the Benefits offered, and God knew they would not when he offered his Favours to them; (as it is impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould not know what they would do) yet &s;uppo&s;ing the Offers to be made upon rea&s;onable Terms, &s;uch as Sinners may comply with if their own wilful Ob&s;tinacy does not hinder them, his Kindne&s;s in &s;uch Offers is manife&s;t. If this be not granted it will follow, that God &s;hews no Kindne&s;s in the Offers of Salvation which he makes to any others be&s;ides tho&s;e that are eventually &s;aved. But who dares thus to affirm: And I can hardly think any Man will affirm, that it is a Kindne&s;s in God to offer Salvation to any Sinner without ever giving him Power to accept of it.</P>
<P>But &s;ome &s;eem to fear that the Doctrine I plead for, is not calcu|lated to <HI>hide Pride from Man,</HI> and keep him humble. Unto which I &s;ay, (1) That I do not think that any Doctrine is well adapted to make and keep Men humble which is contrary to Truth, which I &s;uppo&s;e the Doctrine I oppo&s;e to be. (2) I would a&s;k which of the&s;e two Doctrines has the greate&s;t Tendency to make and keep Men humble, <HI>viz. Fir&s;t,</HI> this, That if any Sinner that has the Offer of Salvation made to him does continue in his Unbelief, and &s;o peri&s;heth, the Rea&s;on of this is, becau&s;e the Condition on which God offered to &s;ave him was wholly above his Power, and &s;uch as he could not po&s;|&s;ibly comply with: Or, <HI>Secondly,</HI> this, that if any Sinner fails of that Salvation which he has an Offer of in the Go&s;pel, the Rea&s;on is not, becau&s;e he is utterly unable to accept of it on Go&s;pel Terms; but be|cau&s;e his Ob&s;tinacy is &s;uch that he will not, unle&s;s God out of his di&s;tingui&s;hing Grace does more for him than he ever does for any Sin|ner that continues in his Unbelief, and &s;o peri&s;heth. This la&s;t is what I maintain: the former is what I oppo&s;e. What I affirm tends both to humble and encourage Sinners; what I oppo&s;e tends greatly to di&s;courage them, rather than to humble them.</P>

<P>_I COME now to the third and la&s;t Part of my E&s;&s;ay, which is to &s;hew,</P>
<P>That the Doctrine maintained in the two former Parts of it, is a Truth of very great Importance, and many Ways u&s;eful.</P>
<P>If now it be demanded of me (as by &s;ome it has been) what the Advantages are of in&s;i&s;ting &s;o much on the Hypothe&s;is I endeavour to defend; and what will be gained by it, if the Truth of it were granted to me; I unto this an&s;wer, <HI>Much every Way.</HI></P>
<P>I pre&s;ume there is no Truth that is a&s;&s;erted in Scrip|ture, and which can be well defended by the Oracles of God, but what may have very profitable Inferences or Conclu&s;ions drawn from it: And much more may this be a&s;&s;erted concerning a Truth &s;o abundantly affirmed in the Go&s;pel of our Salvation, and interwoven with all the Parts of it, as that is which I &s;uppo&s;e I have now &s;ufficiently defended.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, therefore, now proceed to in&s;tance in &s;ome of the Advantages we gain by admitting of it.; and to &s;hew what u&s;eful Inferences it yields to us; and this I will endeavour in the following Chapters.</P>

<PB N="178" REF="005439_0193_1018327498bf9df8">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>THE FIRST USE</HI> of the Truth a&s;&s;erted, is, That it gives Light to many Texts of Scripture, which cannot be well under&s;tood without it.</HEAD>
<P>To in&s;tance in &s;ome of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. _THERE are &s;everal Texts of Scripture, in which it is plainly affirmed, That <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t died for all.</HI> Heb. 2.9. That <HI>by the Grace of God he &s;hould ta&s;te Death for every Man.</HI> 1 John 2.2. <HI>He is the Propitiation for our Sins: And not for ours only, but for the Sins of the whole World</HI>; with which that well agreeth, I&s;ai. 53.6. <HI>All we like Sheep have gone a&s;tray: We have turned every one to his own Way, and the Lord hath laid on him the Iniquity of us all.</HI> We have al&s;o the &s;ame Thing, in effect, a&s;&s;erted by our Saviour him&s;elf, John 3.16. <HI>God &s;o loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth on him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Life.</HI> I know that many of our Divines endeavour to give &s;uch an Expo&s;ition of the&s;e Places and others like them, as to reconcile them to their own Opi|nion of Chri&s;t's dying for the <HI>Elect only</HI>: But my De&s;ign is not to con&s;ider the Weight and Strength of what they &s;ay to this Purpo&s;e. However, I know that all they can do or &s;ay, does not &s;atisfy me and many others. And &s;everal who were no <HI>Arminians</HI> have endea|voured to maintain this as a &s;acred Truth, That Je&s;us Chri&s;t died for the whole World of Mankind; who yet have maintained the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;pecial Grace, in order to the Conver&s;ion and Salvation of the Elect of God: And with the&s;e I agree, &s;uppo&s;ing they mean, (1) That none will ever &s;avingly believe in Chri&s;t, and &s;o obtain eter|nal Life, for whom God does no more than he does for tho&s;e that never &s;o believe. (2) That without an Act of his &s;pecial Grace, and of his mighty Power, &s;uch as none but the Elect have experience of, none are, or ever can be, regenerated or born again: But if tho&s;e who
<PB N="179" REF="005439_0194_101832ca7701a270">
go this Way deny that any be&s;ides the Elect have that Grace given them, by the Help whereof they may comply with, or perform, the Condition on which Salvation is offered to them, not being without a Power by which they may do it, I can by no Means agree with them. By Grace I here intend &s;uch as is meant, and to be under&s;tood in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.1. and <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 5.4.</P>
<P>To what End can we &s;uppo&s;e Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould lay down his Life to purcha&s;e Salvation for any, &s;o far forth that they might be &s;aved on &s;ome Condition propo&s;ed to them in the Go&s;pel, (as he has indeed done, <HI>John</HI> 3.16.1 <HI>John</HI> 4.9, 10.) without a Suppo&s;ition of their having Power given them to perform that Condition? What Advantage has any Sinner by this, that he may be &s;aved, if he believe and repent, or perform &s;uch or &s;uch a Condition, when he neither is, nor ever will be, enabled to perform it? For &s;uch mu&s;t as cer|tainly and unavoidably peri&s;h, as they &s;hould have done if Chri&s;t had not died for them. I therefore &s;uppo&s;e their Principles to be altogether incon&s;i&s;tent, who hold, that Chri&s;t died for all, and yet deny that God gives Power to any be&s;ides the Elect, to perform the Condition on which Salvation is offered to all, unto whom the Go&s;pel is preached. And I would here a&s;k any One who thinks he can vindicate this Principle of Dr. TWISSE in particular,
<Q>That Chri&s;t died for all, <HI>i. e.</HI> to purcha&s;e Salvation for them on this Condition, that they believe and repent,</Q>
who yet hold, as I &s;uppo&s;e he did, That the Faith and Repentance to this End required of Sinners is of that Kind which is given in Regeneration; and which no Man can have 'till he is born again; (becau&s;e none but the Regenerate can be|lieve and repent) how the&s;e Things can con&s;i&s;t one with the other?</P>
<P>But now, on the Hypothe&s;is which I have endeavoured to defend, Chri&s;t not only obtained this Advantage for Sinners, that they might be &s;aved on the Condition of the go&s;pel Covenant, but al&s;o obtained that Grace for them, by which they &s;hould be enabled to perform that Condition. But then the Condition required, according to my Prin|ciples, is not this, that they &s;avingly change their own Hearts, and be|come regenerate Saints; but that they, in a &s;uitable Manner, &s;eek to God to do this for them; and yet in &s;uch a Manner, as with his Help they may, before they are new Creatures.</P>
<P>And thus I account for what is affirmed in tho&s;e Texts of Scripture, where Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;aid to have <HI>died for all Men,</HI> without denying what is plainly a&s;&s;erted in them: And I am glad that on my Principles I am not obliged to depart from the literal Sen&s;e of &s;uch Texts.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="005439_0195_10183278151f5d28">Again 2. There are in &s;everal Texts of Scripture, &s;o far as I can &s;ee, as plain <HI>conditional</HI> Promi&s;es of <HI>converting Grace,</HI> as can in Words well be expre&s;&s;ed; &s;ome of which Places I have already con&s;idered and vindicated in this Di&s;cour&s;e; as <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.22, 23. and Chap. 2.3, 4, 5. <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.5. <HI>Luke</HI> 11.13. and others. But &s;uch as are fixed in this Principle, That God has not promi&s;ed to give his holy Spirit to any Per&s;on, on Condition of his doing any Thing that is po&s;&s;ible for a Sinner to do, before he is actually converted, and endow|ed with the Grace of Regeneration, &s;eem to me to be at a great Lo&s;s how to account for what is &s;aid in &s;everal &s;uch Promi&s;es. Thus when God promi&s;es to give <HI>true &s;piritual Wi&s;dom</HI> to tho&s;e that <HI>cry after it, lifting up their Voices for it, &s;eeking it as Silver, and &s;earching for it as for hid Trea&s;ure,</HI> as in <HI>Prov.</HI> 2.2, 3, 4, 5. before mentioned; the Meaning of this Place is commonly &s;aid to be, that God will give more &s;piritual Wi&s;dom to &s;uch as are already &s;piritually wi&s;e, which &s;uch Seekers are already &s;uppo&s;ed to be. Now this Place thus ex|plained, is not allowed to be a Direction to &s;uch as are yet de&s;titute of &s;aving Grace or Holine&s;s, (the Wi&s;dom intended in it) what Cour&s;e they &s;hould take, in order to their obtaining it; (which yet is the plain De&s;ign of the Words from Ver&s;e 1. to the 6th.) but only to &s;hew &s;uch as are already &s;piritually wi&s;e, how they may become yet wi&s;er.</P>
<P>For my Part I dare not &s;o expound this Place, and &s;everal others like it; and I believe none el&s;e would, were it not for a prae-conceived Opinion, that a Principle of &s;aving Grace is not on any Condition offered and promi&s;ed to Sinners: Which Opinion I know no &s;olid Ground for. Whereas on the other Hand, on the Principle by me received, all &s;uch Places may be taken and under&s;tood according to the plain and literal Sen&s;e of them; and we need not be put to any Difficulty to account for the Meaning of them: And I can a&s;&s;ure my Reader, I have met with pious and learned Men, who have declared to me, what Difficulty they have been put to about the Meaning of &s;uch Places; and who have declared their Satisfaction in the &s;ame Account of them that has now been given.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in&s;tance in one other Sort of Texts, which, I think, cannot be under&s;tood without allowing my Hypothe&s;is to be true: I mean &s;uch Texts as require <HI>Per&s;everance,</HI> as a nece&s;&s;ary Condition of Man's Salvation, or &s;uch &s;pecial Mercies as imply Salvation in them, to &s;uch as per&s;evere, <HI>Matth.</HI> 10.22. and Chap. 24.13. <HI>He that endureth to the End, &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> We have the &s;ame in Effect, <HI>Luke</HI> 13.13. The &s;ame Thing is implied in <HI>Ho&s;ea</HI> 6.3. <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.9. and I doubt
<PB N="181" REF="005439_0196_101832ce285d5020">
not al&s;o in <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.25,&mdash;30. I cannot think that the Meaning of the&s;e, and &s;uch like Texts, is this, That if &s;uch as are <HI>Believers,</HI> in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e of this Word, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;uch as are born of God, and become <HI>new Creatures,</HI> do not fall from their Faith, and become Un|believers, and again Unregenerate, then they &s;hall inherit eternal Life. Such as the&s;e have &s;ufficient A&s;&s;urance given, that they are in no Danger of &s;uch an Apo&s;tacy, as appears in <HI>John</HI> 5.24. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1. <HI>Jer.</HI> 32.38, 39, 40. <HI>John</HI> 10.27, 28, 29. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.2,&mdash;5. and in many other Places, as tho&s;e with whom I di&s;pute do acknow|ledge. <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> maintain that ju&s;tifying Faith, by which the Elect of God receive Je&s;us Chri&s;t and all his &s;aving Benefits, is but one Act; that a Sinner does no &s;ooner begin to believe with Faith of that Kind, than he is perfectly ju&s;tified and firmly entitled to all the ever|la&s;ting Mercies which are offered in the new Covenant; and that in this Covenant, even his Per&s;everance, and his being made perfect in Holine&s;s, is firmly promi&s;ed, &s;o that there is no Po&s;&s;ibility that any &s;uch &s;hould fall away and eternally peri&s;h.</P>
<P>Now, how incongruous would it be to tell Per&s;ons in &s;uch a State as this, that they &s;hall be &s;aved, if they do not fall from Grace, re|lap&s;ing again into that E&s;tate, which they were in before they were born of the Spirit! I think nothing could be more ab&s;urd. I there|fore conclude, that the mentioned Texts can have no &s;uch Meaning. They cannot be intended as Cautions to regenerate Per&s;ons, again&s;t a total and final Apo&s;tacy, they having already fully complied with the Terms, on which the whole of their Salvation is &s;ecured to them, in the Covenant of Grace.</P>
<P>But now, on my Hypothe&s;is, there may be a fair Account given of all &s;uch Texts as the&s;e mentioned: For, according to that, I freely acknowledge a Per&s;on may have the &s;ame Kind of Faith which is the Condition of the new Covenant, and yet be &s;till in an unregenerate and unju&s;tified State; becau&s;e the Covenant I &s;peak of does not only compri&s;e in it the Condition of it, Men's beginning to act &s;uch a Kind of Faith: So that believing for a Moment &s;hould be &s;ufficient to entitle the Sinner to the &s;ame Mercies of that Covenant: This, ac|cording to the Tenor of the new Covenant, will not an&s;wer the End: But the Condition of it includes this al&s;o in it, that the Sinner that would be &s;aved in the Way it pre&s;cribeth, mu&s;t per&s;evere and go on to believe, during the whole of that Term of Time which God, ac|cording to his good Will and Plea&s;ure, has alotted for his Probation, in order to his &s;ecuring his eternal Happine&s;s; which how long it may be, God does not ordinarily reveal to tho&s;e unto whom he grants
<PB N="182" REF="005439_0197_1018327d41a2caf0">
it, but keeps it in his own Power; yet will he be mindful of his Co|venant, and take Care to fulfill that Word of his, on which he has given us Rea&s;on to depend, Gal. 6.9. <HI>Let us not be weary in well-doing; for in due Sea&s;on we &s;hall reap, if we faint not.</HI> With which Words many other Texts very well agree, &s;uch as tho&s;e la&s;t mentioned, and <HI>Luke</HI> 18. Beginning. And then God fulfills &s;uch Promi&s;es unto tho&s;e who wait for his Salvation, when he pardoneth their Sins, and poureth out his holy Spirit on them, as in <HI>Acts</HI> 2.39. <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.23. <HI>Luke</HI> 11.13.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>THE SECOND USE</HI> of the Truth maintained, That it renders the Offers of Salvation made to Sinners in the Go&s;pel, very plain and intelligible.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is very nece&s;&s;ary that the Go&s;pel, and the Offers of it made to &s;inful Men, &s;hould be very plain, and ea&s;ily under&s;tood. Mankind in their lap&s;ed State, unto whom the Offers of Salvation by a Re|deemer are here &s;uppo&s;ed to be made, are in a State of Darkne&s;s. That is their Character, Eph. 4.18. <HI>Having their Under&s;tanding darkned, being alienated from the Life of God, thro' the Ignorance that is in them, becau&s;e of the Blindne&s;s of their Heart.</HI> They are not only exceeding back|ward to believe, but are al&s;o dull of under&s;tanding the Things that belong to their eternal Peace and Welfare, however clearly they are propo&s;ed to them: How then &s;hould they under&s;tand them, if they are not clearly and intelligibly propo&s;ed? And it &s;eems to me, that the common Way of Preaching the Go&s;pel, is &s;omewhat defective in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;pect The Way is not made &s;o plain as it &s;hould be. Now I hope that if the Doctrine I plead for be admitted as true, the Way of Salvation by a Redeemer will be made much the plainer.</P>
<P>There are two great Difficulties that the apo&s;tate Children of Men labour under; one of them is that State of Guilt, in which they are,
<PB N="183" REF="005439_0198_101832d1a23f9400">
in Re&s;pect of which they are all, without Exception, <HI>Children of Wrath,</HI> Eph. 2.3. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10. The other is that Corruption of their Na|ture, unto which, by the Fall, they have been made &s;ubject; and which in the Way of Propagation, has been conveyed from Parent to Child, even to all de&s;cending from <HI>Adam,</HI> in the Way of natural Ge|neration, from Age to Age, ever &s;ince the Beginning of the World: For <HI>Adam,</HI> our moral Head and Repre&s;entative, having &s;inned again&s;t God in eating the forbidden Fruit, God was &s;o provoked with him that he took his Holy Spirit from him, and deprived him of his Image, as was declared in Part I. Chap. I. And all his Po&s;terity ever &s;ince, being liable to the penal Con&s;equences of his Apo&s;tacy, have been brought into the World in the like mi&s;erable State, with Natures de|praved as his was. Hence &s;uch Texts as the&s;e, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.5. &amp; 58.3. al&s;o <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 48.8. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12. and Ver&s;e 19. Now while this Cor|ruption remains, Men are uncapable of Happine&s;s by a Sight of God, and Communion with him, as the Scriptures abundantly declare, <HI>John</HI> 3.3. and Ver&s;e 5. with which Places that well agreeth, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.9, 10. and Ver&s;e 14, 15. and <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.8. Nor can &s;uch unclean Per&s;ons enter into the Kingdom of Glory, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.27.</P>
<P>Now, that the Go&s;pel may afford &s;ufficient Relief to Sinners with Relation to both the&s;e Difficulties which they are under, it &s;eems needful it &s;hould afford a Remedy in Re&s;pect of both; and I &s;uppo&s;e it does &s;o, by offering Deliverance from one, as well as the other of them, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch mi&s;erable Sinners &s;hould be made happy.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider, whether this be really done in the common Way of Preaching the Go&s;pel; and whether it be not done in the Way which, according to my Principles, it ought to be.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, according to the common and allowed Way of Preach|ing the Go&s;pel, there is only &s;uppo&s;ed to be an Offer of Pardon or Ju&s;tification made to Sinners, with &s;uch other Benefits as are &s;uppo|&s;ed to follow thereon; &s;uch as Peace with God, Adoption, Growth in Grace, Per&s;everance in it, and eternal Glory in the heavenly World: But there is no Offer &s;uppo&s;ed to be made to Sinners, of Regeneration, or a new Heart and a new Spirit, or of the re&s;toring God's Image to them; which is a Mercy they as much need as the others mentioned. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that God does not, on any Terms, offer to do this for them: Nay, it is earne&s;tly di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d that he does not. They are, indeed, told that God may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for them, and that there are Rea&s;ons for them to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">; but conditional
<PB N="184" REF="005439_0199_1018330f03ea51c0">
Promi&s;e they have none, on which they may ground &s;uch Hope: Nor can they do any Thing, but &s;in and provoke God, 'till this be fir&s;t done for them; and &s;o, I think, nothing that has any Tendency to prevail with God to grant them this Mercy.</P>
<P>And whereas &s;uch Sinners are frequently &s;aid to have an Offer of Salvation made to them, this Salvation mu&s;t &s;till be under&s;tood to compri&s;e no more in it, than the Benefits mentioned in the la&s;t Para|graph. To be &s;ure it is not &s;uppo&s;ed to imply the Grace of Rege|neration in it; which I take to be one of the mo&s;t eminent Parts of the Salvation of &s;inful Men.</P>
<P>Let us a little con&s;ider how Ju&s;tification, Adoption, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be &s;aid to be offered on the Hypothe&s;is I oppo&s;e, where there is no Offer &s;uppo&s;ed to be made of the Grace of Regeneration. According to the Scheme oppo&s;ed by me, the Offer of Forgivene&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made to Sinners in the Go&s;pel, is made on Condition that Sinners believe on the Son of God; but the Faith in this Ca&s;e required is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an Act of a regenerate Soul, and cannot be exerci&s;ed by any Per|&s;on 'till he is fir&s;t <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> and <HI>become a new Creature</HI>; which Grace the Sinner is not &s;et in any certain Way to obtain: So that there is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an Offer of Salvation on a Condition which the Sinner is under a phy&s;ical Impo&s;&s;ibility of performing, 'till he be created anew, and this none can do for him, but God; and he does not on any Terms offer to do it, if the Doctrine I oppo&s;e be true. Such an Offer (if any &s;uch there were) I confe&s;s, &s;eems not to me to have any Kindne&s;s in it. If a rich Man &s;hould offer a &s;ick Man to give him a fair and large E&s;tate, on a Condition which none but a Man in Health can perform; and which the rich Man being a Phy|&s;ician, could only re&s;tore to him, but would not put him in a Way to recover, would the &s;ick Man in this Ca&s;e think him&s;elf much obliged to him for &s;uch an Offer, e&s;pecially if he never did the Thing for him? I think he could not have much Rea&s;on for it. Yea, I think that tho' there would be the Shew of an Offer, yet really there would be none.</P>
<P>If it be here &s;aid, that Sinners are required to endeavour to believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and they do not know but that God may help them &s;o to do; I de&s;ire to know how an unregenerate Man may endea|vour to believe in &s;uch a Manner, as he is a&s;&s;ured he is under a phy|&s;ical Impo&s;&s;ibility of doing. I have no Idea of a Way to try to do that which I have no Power to do any Thing towards, and a Thing
<PB N="185" REF="005439_0200_1018107f0f8ffa70">
in my pre&s;ent State utterly impo&s;&s;ible for me to do. An unregenerate Man may pray to God to give him Grace to believe; and to do &s;o is his pre&s;ent Duty; and I believe in his Power: But I would be in|formed how an unregenerate Per&s;on &s;hould try to do that which he is &s;ure he cannot? When our Saviour commanded the Man with the withered Hand, to &s;tretch it forth, <HI>Matth.</HI> 12.13. he did not com|mand him to do &s;omething which he had no Power to do. The Meaning of the Command was, that he &s;hould attempt to do it, <HI>i. e.</HI> by moving his Arm, or Parts contiguous to his Hand that was withe|red, which no Doubt the Man had a Power of doing; and if he had failed in his Attempt, he had not therein been di&s;obedient to Chri&s;t's Command. But I &s;uppo&s;e the Command implied a Promi&s;e of ne|ce&s;&s;ary Aid, if Obedience to it were regularly endeavoured.</P>
<P>Thus, I think it evident, that the Go&s;pel being under&s;tood accor|ding to the Suppo&s;ition I am di&s;&s;atisfied with, is far from being plain and intelligible.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> let us con&s;ider on the other Hand, whether on my Hypothe&s;is, the Offers of the Go&s;pel are not more plain and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood; and &s;o better accommodated to the State of a &s;inful World, to whom they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be made.</P>
<P>According as I explain the Go&s;pel of the Grace of God, the Sal|vation offered in it compri&s;es all that is nece&s;&s;ary on God's Part, in order to the everla&s;ting Happine&s;s of tho&s;e, to whom the Grace of God is offered. God is willing <HI>to give Grace and Glory; and no good Thing will he withold</HI> from them who humbly &s;eek him for his Salva|tion. The Salvation he offers compri&s;es in it, not only the free Par|don of all our Sins, and the Ju&s;tification of our Per&s;ons in his Sight, thro' that mo&s;t perfect and everla&s;ting Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which Chri&s;t has already brought in, as in <HI>Dan.</HI> 9.24. a Righteou&s;ne&s;s ready at Hand, to be imputed to all tho&s;e that believe in him who is the Au|thor of it; and is actually imputed to all that ever have believed in him in the Manner which the Go&s;pel requireth; and &s;hall be al&s;o imputed to as many as &s;hall hereafter believe in him, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.23, 24. The Salvation offered does, I &s;ay, not only compri&s;e in it the Ju&s;ti|fication of them that believe, by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t imputed to them; but al&s;o as a Con&s;equence of &s;uch Imputation, the Reno|vation of their Natures by the &s;pecial Grace of God, re&s;toring the Image of God, which by Rea&s;on of Sin we had lo&s;t; and which could never be re&s;tored, were not Sinners fir&s;t ab&s;olved from their Guilt, as I have abundantly proved. In order to their receiving &s;uch Benefits there is &s;omething required of them, <HI>Namely,</HI> That they believe, re|pent,
<PB N="186" REF="005439_0201_101832d34fb6b868">
and &s;eek the Lord, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which may not be under&s;tood of &s;uch Actions, for Kind, as follow our Ju&s;tification and Regeneration, but &s;uch as, in Order of Nature, go before the &s;ame, as I have formerly &s;hewed. And thus the Go&s;pel is plain and intelligible, and the Grace of God &s;hining forth in it, very marvellous, God in it not requiring the Exerci&s;e of that Grace, which he does not give, but which Sin|ners do receive from him; and which he requires them <HI>not to receive in vain,</HI> 2 Cor. 6.1.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>THE THIRD USE</HI> of the Doctrine in&s;i&s;ted on, That it gives us a very plea&s;ant and en|dearing View and Pro&s;pect of the unparal|lel'd Love of God, in finding out, provi|ding and revealing &s;uch a Way of Salva|tion as that made known in the Go&s;pel.</HEAD>
<P>_I HAVE proved, That there is a conditional Offer of Salvation made to Sinners in the Go&s;pel; that the Grace given in Regeneration, is compri&s;ed in the Salvation offered; that, con&s;equently, that Grace cannot be contained or implied in the Con|dition of the new Covenant, or in the Terms on which God offers to &s;ave Sinners; that, therefore, the&s;e Terms are &s;uch, that Men need not be regenerated or born a|gain, in order to their complying with them; but may, through the Grace of God granted to &s;uch as are &s;till in an unregenerate State, be complied with; and that Sinners cannot, while they enjoy the Grace of God granted to them in and with the Go&s;pel, truly plead their ut|ter Inability to comply with the mo&s;t gracious Terms of the new Covenant.</P>
<P>And from the&s;e Things which I now take for granted, it plainly follows, that God does in the Go&s;pel put Sinners, to whom the Offer of it is made, on a <HI>new</HI> and <HI>&s;econd Trial,</HI> on Terms in their Nature po&s;&s;ible to be performed by them, in order to their eternal Happine&s;s;
<PB N="187" REF="005439_0202_101832d60f15dcb8">
&s;o that if they again mi&s;carry, it is becau&s;e <HI>they will,</HI> and not be|cau&s;e they have <HI>no Power</HI> to come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our glorious Re|deemer, for eternal Life and Salvation.</P>
<P>Now, what unparallel'd Love is this to &s;elf-de&s;troying Sinners, to whom God may truly &s;ay, as in Ho&s;ea 13.9. <HI>Oh</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed thy &s;elf; but in me is thine Help.</HI> This Love of God is very much celebrated in the holy Scriptures. Give me Leave to recite a few of the Pa&s;&s;ages wherein it is &s;o. John 3.16. <HI>For God &s;o loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Life.</HI> 1 John 4.9, 10. <HI>In this was manife&s;ted the Love of God towards us, becau&s;e that God &s;ent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live thro' him. Herein is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and &s;ent his Son to be the Propitiation for our Sins.</HI> 2 Cor. 5.18, 19, 20. <HI>God&mdash;hath re|conciled us to him&s;elf by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and hath given to us the Mini&s;try of Reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Chri&s;t reconciling the World unto him&s;elf, not imputing their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es unto them; and hath committed unto us the Word of Reconciliation. Now then we are Amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t, as tho' God did be&s;eech you by us: We pray you in Chri&s;t's Stead, be ye reconciled unto God.</HI> Matth. 23.37. <HI>O</HI> Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, <HI>thou that kille&s;t the Prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them which are &s;ent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not!</HI> Rom. 24. <HI>Or de&s;pi&s;e&s;t thou the Riches of his Goodne&s;s, and Forbearance, and Long-&s;uffering; not knowing that the Goodne&s;s of God leadeth thee to Repentance.</HI> Ho&s;ea 11.4. <HI>I drew them with Cords of a Man, with Bands of Love; and I was to them as they that take off the Yoke on their Jaws; and I laid Meat before them.</HI></P>
<P>I am not a&s;hamed to &s;ay, (if I were I &s;hould be a&s;hamed of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, contrary to <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.16.) that the Love of God thus manife&s;ted towards Sinners, has not a Relation to the Elect only, (tho' principally unto them) but extends it &s;elf to the whole World, as in the mentioned <HI>John</HI> 3.16. and in 1 <HI>John</HI> 2.2. <HI>Mark</HI> 16.15, 16. and 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19. as I will, if I am put upon it, and God gives me Liberty, more fully &s;hew.</P>
<P>They are greatly mi&s;taken who think that the Goodne&s;s and Kind|ne&s;s of God towards Mankind appearing, is only to be di&s;covered and judged of, by what does in the Event befall them, and not at all by the Nature and Tendency of what he does for them. If God affords unto Sinners &s;uch Means and Aids as, according to the Nature of
<PB N="188" REF="005439_0203_101832d933ffeb90">
Things, are &s;ufficient to put them in a Way to obtain eternal Life, they u&s;ing proper Endeavours to that End: He therein di&s;plays his Kindne&s;s and Good-will towards them, what ever the I&s;&s;ue be with Re&s;pect to them. Nor will God's fore-knowing that the&s;e or tho&s;e will neglect or mi&s;improve the Means and Advantages with which he favours them, alter the Nature of the Thing, and make them no Be|nefits, which otherwi&s;e would have been &s;uch; if it would do &s;o, it would be impo&s;&s;ible that any &s;hould receive real Benefit who finally peri&s;h; for it is impo&s;&s;ible that God &s;hould not know how they will improve, or rather mi&s;improve them: And if God might not ju&s;tly puni&s;h Sinners, either for not doing what they &s;hould, or doing what they &s;hould not, becau&s;e he fore-knew what they would do, and what they would not, it would follow, that he could never ju&s;tly puni&s;h any for Sin, becau&s;e he could not be ignorant of what Men would do or omit, before &s;uch Things were done or omitted.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince we mu&s;t judge of the Goodne&s;s of God to Mankind, by the Nature and Tendency of what he does, and not only by what eventually befalls them, we mu&s;t acknowledge the great Goodne&s;s of God unto Sinners, even to tho&s;e of them that &s;hall at la&s;t peri&s;h; e|&s;pecially this may be affirmed on the Hypothe&s;is I defend: And there is no Doubt but that God intends to gain unto him&s;elf a large Re|venue of Glory, on the Account of what he does for them, who &s;hall eternally peri&s;h for their Sins, as well as for tho&s;e whom he will eter|nally &s;ave: And in the mean Time, tho&s;e who never will attain eter|nal Life, are bound to give Thanks and Prai&s;e to God, for putting them in a Way in which they may attain it, if the Fault be not their own.</P>
<P>And it is a great Sin in God's own People, if they do not confe&s;s to his Glory, that he deals very kindly by tho&s;e, who, thro' their own Fault and Negligence, fail of the Grace of God, and fall &s;hort of eternal Life. The Ob&s;tinacy and Unbelief of Sinners who de&s;pi&s;e his Goodne&s;s, and tread under Foot the Blood of his dear Son, whom he &s;ent to &s;ave them, ought not to make us think meanly of what he does for them; but we &s;hould admire and magnify his Grace on the Account of it. And I confe&s;s I cannot but wonder that many who treat of the Kindne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion of God towards peri&s;hing Sinners, re&s;train all their Di&s;cour&s;e about it, to what he has done for the Elect, as if others were no Ways concerned in it; which the Scriptures &s;eem not to do, as appears in the Texts la&s;t above quoted, and in many others be&s;ide them, as in I&s;ai. 53.6. <HI>All we like Sheep have gone a&s;tray: We have turned every one to his own Way, and the Lord hath laid on him

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>THE FOURTH USE</HI> of the Truth in&s;i&s;ted on, <HI>viz.</HI> The Encouragement given to convin|ced and awakened Sinners, to &s;eek earne&s;tly to <HI>GOD</HI> for his &s;pecial Grace and Mercy.</HEAD>
<P>_IF it be a Truth, as I think it evidently appears to be, That God has in his holy Word, made many conditional Promi&s;es to the Unregenerate, of be|&s;towing his &s;pecial and eternal Mercies (the Grace of Regeneration not excepted) on all &s;uch as do, in the Way by him appointed, &s;eriou&s;ly and diligently &s;eek to him for them; what great Encouragement is there herein to &s;uch convinced and awakened Sinners, to comply with the Method propo&s;ed in the Go&s;pel, in order to their obtaining the&s;e Mercies? There be many of the &s;inful Children of Men too in&s;en&s;ible of their mi&s;erable State by Nature; and the&s;e had need have the Terrors of the Lord &s;et before them, le&s;t they &s;hould remain in&s;en&s;ible, and &s;o never look out for a Remedy, but peri&s;h in their Sins: But the Ca&s;e is not &s;o with all: There are &s;ome who have been bro't to a Sight of the woful State they are in by Nature; and tho&s;e need all the Encouragement to &s;eek to God for Mercy, that can, according to the Tenor of the new Covenant, be given them.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e it will not be denied, that Sinners in an unregenerate State, are &s;ometimes greatly awakened, and in &s;ome Sort humbled,
<PB N="190" REF="005439_0205_101832e1e74aa3b8">
under a deep Sen&s;e of their wretched State by Nature. The Spirit of God &s;ent to convince the World of Sin, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Judg|ment, does &s;o &s;et home the Terrors of the broken Covenant of Works upon their Souls, that they &s;ee them&s;elves in &s;uch Danger of Damna|tion, that they are put upon enquiring, <HI>what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved,</HI> as in <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37. and Chap. 16.30. And now they de&s;ire <HI>to flee from the Wrath to come</HI>; and it may be are convinced that they cannot be &s;aved by any Righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own; being &s;en&s;ible that in their pre&s;ent State of Sin and Death, they cannot perform any Actions truly holy; and that, if they could, they &s;hould not thereby de&s;erve any Favour at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd of God; and that they are therefore <HI>wretched, mi&s;erable, poor, blind, and naked</HI>: And now they would be glad to &s;ee a Door of Hope opened to them: And hereupon having had the Go&s;|pel preached to them, they begin to conceive that there is &s;ome Hopes for them, and &s;ome Encouragement given them, and upon this they begin to cry to God for Mercy. But all this nothwith&s;tanding, they are in a State of Nature &s;till, and have not yet <HI>attained the Faith of God's Elect,</HI> and the Remi&s;&s;ion of their Sins: Or may we venture to tell them the <HI>Bitterne&s;s of Death is pa&s;t with them,</HI> being already <HI>pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life,</HI> and that <HI>there is no Condemnation for them,</HI> as <HI>being in Chri&s;t Je&s;us?</HI> John 5.24. and <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1. If we &s;hould tell them &s;o, they would be Fools if they believed us, without any better Evi|dence of a State of Grace, than any Thing that is above expre&s;&s;ed. However, it will be acknowledged, that the&s;e ought to be encoura|ged to &s;eek to God in the Way of Duty and Well-doing, for his everla&s;ting Mercies, and in particular for the regenerating Influences of his holy Spirit.</P>
<P>And here the <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> is, What Encouragement may the&s;e have from the Word of God, to &s;eek to him for the mentioned Favours? Now &s;ome mu&s;t on their Principles &s;ay to them,
<Q>God calls you to &s;eek to him for his &s;aving Grace, but has not, indeed, promi&s;ed that he will grant you the De&s;ires of your Souls herein; but it may be he will do &s;o; for he is very gracious and merciful, and does be&s;tow his Grace on many that &s;eek to him for it; and you do not know but he may do &s;o for you, as well as for others: Tho' it may be a Truth, that after all your Strivings and Seeking, you may fail of the Grace of God, and peri&s;h for ever: But there is Room for you to hope, that God will be&s;tow his Grace upon you, if you diligently &s;eek him for it, and per&s;evere in &s;o doing: But however you cannot be &s;ure of this, there being no Promi&s;e of it in the Word of God.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="005439_0206_101832e52346d688">But on the Hypothe&s;is I advance, we may &s;ay to &s;uch awakened Sinners as are before mentioned, who al&s;o have begun to &s;eek the Lord;

<P>Thus may we treat awakened Sinners on my Principles.

Has not a poor Sinner on this Hypothe&s;is, greater Encourage|ment to &s;eek the Lord, than on their's, who only hold, that there are Grounds of Hope that God will convert and &s;ave tho&s;e who earne&s;tly &s;eek him for his converting Grace; but deny that he has promi&s;ed that he will do &s;o?

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>THE FIFTH USE.</HI> The Truth maintained in this E&s;&s;ay, takes from all tho&s;e who refu&s;e the great Salvation offered in the Go&s;pel, any Room to excu&s;e them&s;elves.</HEAD>
<P>_THAT Sinners who neglect their Duty, and the great Salvation offered to them in the Go&s;pel, are very apt to endeavour to <HI>excu&s;e them&s;elves</HI> in the Neglect whereof they are guilty, is too evident to need Time and Pains to be &s;pent in the Proof of it. For Satisfaction as to this, we need only turn to the Parable of the great Supper, <HI>Luke</HI> 14.18,&mdash;23.</P>
<P>And &s;o far as my Ob&s;ervation reacheth, there is Nothing by Sin|ners more frequently pleaded as an Excu&s;e for their wicked Neglect of the Salvation offered, and Duties required of them; than their utter Inability to comply with the Terms of the Go&s;pel, and perform the Conditions of the new Covenant. They plead, that it is not in their Power to believe and repent, and to call upon God in a Manner acceptable to him: They &s;ay, that &s;uch as are &s;till in an unregenerate State are wicked Per&s;ons, and if they &s;hould attempt it, all that they could do, would be an Abomination to the Lord, and would but provoke him. And indeed I know not very well how to an&s;wer &s;uch Objections, on the Hypothe&s;is I oppo&s;e; for if all that it is po&s;&s;ible for the Unregenerate to do, is, as we are taught, truly and properly Sin; and we do but provoke and offend the mo&s;t High God in the be&s;t of our Actions, while we are in that State, it is not ea&s;y, if po&s;&s;ible, for &s;uch Sinners to &s;ee that their Attempts to &s;eek the Lord, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to turn to their Advantage.</P>
<P>But now, if the Ca&s;e be otherwi&s;e than is by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and even as I have maintained it to be, namely, That the Condition on which Salvation is offered to Sinners, does not con&s;i&s;t in any Act or Acts, to be performed by them after they are <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> and <HI>become new Creatures</HI>; but in &s;uch a Kind of Faith, Repentance, and
<PB N="193" REF="005439_0208_101832eb9bdc1868">
Seeking of God, as convinced and awakened Sinners, tho' unregene|rate, are capable of, during the Day of their Vi&s;itation, while God is &s;triving with them by his Word and Spirit; then the &s;eeming Strength of the Objection vani&s;heth away, and there does not appear to be any Force in it at all.</P>
<P>For according to my Hypothe&s;is, tho&s;e who go about to excu&s;e their Unbelief and Impenitency, from a pretended utter Inability to do the Things required of them, ought to be told plainly, that this Plea of their's is utterly fal&s;e, and that they &s;peak fal&s;ly in &s;aying, that God in this requires of them what they are not able to perform. If it be &s;aid, that they cannot do it without Help from God, I an&s;wer, that God does not require them to do it without Help from him: He actually affords them the Aids nece&s;&s;ary in order to their beginning to do what he requires; and is ready to afford them more Help, if they need and de&s;ire it. I doubt not but &s;o much is intended in Jam. 4.8, 9, 10. <HI>Draw nigh unto God, and he will draw nigh unto you: Clean&s;e your Hands, ye Sinners, and purify your Hearts, ye Double-minded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: Let your Laughter be turned into Mourn|ing, and your Joy into Heavine&s;s. Humble your &s;elves in the Sight of the Lord, and he &s;hall lift you up.</HI></P>
<P>Ye unregenerate Sinners, if ye &s;ay ye cannot do this, by the Help of that Grace which God either gives or offers you, ye <HI>belie the Lord,</HI> as the Phra&s;e is, <HI>Jer.</HI> 5.12. Our Lord upbraided the unbelieving Jews that they <HI>would not come to him, that they might have Life,</HI> John 5.40. They could, I acknowledge, have truly &s;aid, that they could not do this unle&s;s God <HI>drew them</HI>; but they could not truly &s;ay, that God drew them not. <HI>He drew them with the Cords of a Man, and with the Bands of his Love,</HI> as in Ho&s;. 10.4. <HI>The Goodne&s;s of God leadeth</HI> even tho&s;e <HI>unto Repentance,</HI> who <HI>after the Hardne&s;s and Impenitency of their Hearts, trea&s;ure up unto them&s;elves Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God,</HI> Rom. 2.4, 5. A Man cannot, I confe&s;s, become a new Creature, unle&s;s God <HI>creates him anew,</HI> giving <HI>a new Heart</HI> to him: But they &s;peak fal&s;ly who &s;ay they cannot &s;eek to God for the Mercy, 'till he has fir&s;t granted the &s;ame to them. <HI>Corazin</HI> and <HI>Beth&s;aida,</HI> as well as <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon,</HI> might have <HI>repented in Du&s;t and A&s;hes,</HI> tho' God had not fir&s;t given them new Hearts. <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.21, 22. <HI>Nineveh</HI> did &s;o, <HI>Jonah</HI> 3.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 6.</P>

<P>Many of tho&s;e by whom &s;everal of the <HI>Arminian</HI> Doctrines &s;eem to be &s;omething favoured, appear to me to be Per&s;ons of great Seriou&s;ne&s;s; and I cannot think that the Oppo&s;ition which they &s;ometimes make again&s;t &s;ome Things in the Scheme by <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> pleaded for, ari&s;eth from an Enmity in their Hearts again&s;t the Grace of God; but ra|ther, le&s;t while Men maintain the Sovereignty of God, in the Affair of Man's Salvation, in the Manner that many <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> do, they &s;hould thereby reflect &s;ome Di&s;honour on the Attributes of his Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s, the doing of which they &s;eem to dread. However, I be|lieve it will be &s;afe&s;t for us to be as charitable as may be, in our Opini|on of &s;uch Per&s;ons; and that we take Care not to make the Differ|ence more and greater than we need.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="005439_0210_101832f3daa06800">Now, &s;uppo&s;e the Hypothe&s;is which I have advanced and pleaded for, be a Truth, I hope our owning and allowing of it wou'd, as I have &s;aid, render &s;everal other Things contained in the Scheme maintained by the Orthodox, the more ea&s;y to be admitted by &s;uch as at pre&s;ent &s;eem to be afraid to own and embrace them. And that I may make what I here &s;ay the more probable, I will give &s;ome In&s;tances, in which I apprehend Things might prove as I hope and de&s;ire they may.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e is the Ca&s;e of <HI>Original Sin. Calvini&s;ts</HI> generally maintain, that the Guilt of <HI>Adam</HI>'s fir&s;t and great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, has fallen on all his Po&s;terity; and that they are all thereby become na|turally <HI>Children of Wrath,</HI> and <HI>Heirs of Death.</HI> They hold al&s;o, that on the Apo&s;tacy of our fir&s;t Parents from God, they lo&s;t his Image, in which they were created; and their Natures were &s;o depraved, that they were thereby rendred uncapable of performing any Actions truly gracious and holy, and as &s;uch acceptable to the Lord; and &s;o were uncapable of Communion with him, and the Enjoyment of him, without the Pardon of Sin and renewing Grace. They al&s;o maintain that in this deplorable State all the Off-&s;pring of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> are involved.</P>
<P>And hereupon they further affirm, that before Men's Regeneration, they are utterly uncapable to accept the Terms, or perform the Con|ditions, required of Sinners in the Go&s;pel, in Order to their Salvation; becau&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e the Go&s;pel in this Ca&s;e requireth &s;omething, the doing whereof &s;uppo&s;eth Men fir&s;t <HI>born again,</HI> and become <HI>new Crea|tures</HI>; which, they &s;ay, few ever attain to: Nor have Sinners any Offer of this Grace made to them. Now, if it be thus, thinks the Per&s;on inclining to <HI>Arminiani&s;m</HI>; (and who is there but by Nature is not inclined to Error?) if this be the Doctrine of <HI>original Sin,</HI> and the Con&s;equences following on it, I cannot, I will not receive it, 'till I can &s;ee &s;uch Evidences for it, as will compel me to yield my A&s;&s;ent thereunto. And now &s;carce any Evidence will convince &s;uch Per&s;ons that a Doctrine is true, that is &s;o hard to be dige&s;ted.</P>
<P>But now let &s;uch <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> from the <HI>calvinian Doctrines</HI> be told, that the Doctrine of <HI>original Sin</HI> is indeed a great Truth; and that the &s;ame may be defended, being duly &s;tated and under&s;tood; but that it is true al&s;o, that God had a De&s;ign of glorifying his Grace and Mercy, in the Redemption of Mankind when fallen into a State of Sin; and that for this End, God &s;ent his Son into the World &s;o to die for all Men, that they might be &s;aved on the Terms of a new
<PB N="196" REF="005439_0211_101832f766d80bc8">
Covenant, which Terms are not &s;uch as they are not able to comply with, by the Help of God's Grace afforded to them, nor &s;uch that they mu&s;t be &s;avingly converted or born again, before, and in order to, their Performance of them; but &s;uch as thro' God's Help, by his Word and Spirit, they may come up to in their pre&s;ent State; and &s;o obtain Deliverance from Sin and Death, if it be not their own Fault in refu&s;ing the Mercies offered to them. If the&s;e Truths are owned and allowed, I think many People would not be &s;o aver&s;e to the Doc|trine of <HI>original Sin</HI> as they now &s;eem to be: For thus the Go&s;pel pro|po&s;eth a Remedy again&s;t it, to every Per&s;on afflicted with the Sen&s;e of it, ina&s;much as it tells every Sinner how he may come to have his Nature renewed, and the Image of God re&s;tored in him; and that the Condition unto this End required of him, is not &s;uch as a Per&s;on in a State of Nature cannot by God's Help perform.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Another Point which I here intend is that of <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> or <HI>Regeneration</HI>: In this I think <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Arminians</HI> differ greatly. <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> (at lea&s;t many of them) hold, that true &s;aving <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> which they al&s;o call <HI>Regeneration,</HI> is a great Change wrought in the Soul of a Sinner by the Spirit of God, whereby he has a new Bla&s;s or Di&s;po&s;ition given him. By this, according to them, the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t Image of God is re&s;tored to a Sinner: Of <HI>carnal</HI> he is hereby made <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> having <HI>a new Heart given to him, and a new Spirit put within him,</HI> as in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26. And this they think is an <HI>in&s;tantaneous Change</HI>; and that the Soul is <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> in it, having no Hand in the working of it; but that it is wholly a Work of God by his Holy Spirit, <HI>creating Men anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good Works,</HI> as in <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.10. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51.10. <HI>John</HI> 3.8. and Chap. 1.13. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.19, 20. and many other Places.</P>
<P>Add hereunto, that, according to <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> Sinners can do no Actions that are &s;piritually good, or truly holy, 'till this Change be fir&s;t wrought in them; and con&s;equently, it is impo&s;&s;ible, (as they think) that any Sinner &s;hould perform the Condition on which Sal|vation is offered to him, 'till he is fir&s;t <HI>converted</HI> and <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> as is above expre&s;&s;ed. And they further think, (&s;ome of them at lea&s;t) that God has no where offered or promi&s;ed in his Word, on any Condition what&s;oever, that he will work &s;uch a Change in any Sin|ner's Soul: And yet if any Sinner does not believe with &s;uch a Kind of Faith as can only be exerci&s;ed by one already &s;o converted, he &s;hall be more &s;everely puni&s;hed, than if he had never had any Offer of Salvation made to him.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="005439_0212_101832fa9a3dae90">Now tho&s;e who are inclined to <HI>Arminiani&s;m</HI> think this Doctrine is &s;o har&s;h they cannot endure it: Nor does it &s;eem to them any Way agreeable to the infinite Goodne&s;s and Mercy of God, made known and revealed in the Go&s;pel. And then &s;uch &s;eek to find &s;ome Flaws in the Doctrine mentioned; and what mo&s;t readily offers it &s;elf to their Mind is, that tho&s;e who thus hold are mi&s;taken with Re&s;pect to the Nature of Conver&s;ion; and that Conver&s;ion or Regeneration is no &s;uch Thing, as they imagine it to be.</P>
<P>The Nature of Man (think they) is not &s;o corrupted, as to need &s;uch a mighty Work of the Spirit of God, in order to the changing of it. The Mini&s;try of the Word, they think, and tho&s;e Motions and Convictions of God's Spirit, which he affords to Sinners under the Go&s;pel, are &s;ufficient to work all the Change in them that is ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to their eternal Happine&s;s: And what is talked of more than this, is a mere Fiction of &s;ome Men's Brains, and has no Foundation in the Word of God, on which it can be built.</P>
<P>But unto &s;uch as the&s;e I &s;ay, according to my Hypothe&s;is, there is indeed a great Mi&s;take relating to the Matter under Con&s;ideration; but it does not lye, as they imagine, in the Doctrine of <HI>Regeneration</HI> by <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> maintained. Sinners need by Conver&s;ion or Regene|ration, &s;uch a Change as they hold nece&s;&s;ary. The Depravation of their Natures by <HI>original Sin,</HI> renders &s;uch a Change indi&s;pen&s;ibly needful, as our Saviour him&s;elf teacheth, <HI>John</HI> 3.3,&mdash;8. and as is in many other Places of Scripture manife&s;ted.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Mi&s;take</HI> lies in this, that it is not truly &s;uppo&s;ed and main|tained, that the Condition required of Sinners in the Go&s;pel, in order to their Salvation, is, that they believe and repent with a Kind of Faith and Repentance, of which no Sinner can be the Subject, who is not fir&s;t <HI>born of God,</HI> and &s;o <HI>a new Creature</HI>; and con&s;equently in a State of Salvation, before ever he exerci&s;eth &s;uch Faith and Repen|tance: When indeed, God's giving us that Grace whereof &s;uch Faith and Repentance is the Fruit and Exerci&s;e, is his &s;aving us; not that whereby we are enabled and di&s;po&s;ed to perform the Condition required of us. No: The Condition required of us, is, that we, <HI>wretched,</HI> and <HI>mi&s;erable,</HI> and <HI>poor,</HI> and <HI>blind,</HI> and <HI>naked</HI> as we are, ap|ply our &s;elves to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for <HI>Gold tried in the Fire,</HI> (true Grace) <HI>that we may be rich</HI>; for <HI>white Raiment,</HI> (his perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s) <HI>that we may be cloathed, and that the Shame of our Nakedne&s;s do not ap|pear</HI>; and for <HI>Eye-Salve, to anoint our Eyes, that we may &s;ee.</HI> We mu&s;t not &s;tay 'till we are renewed and &s;anctified by the Spirit of God,
<PB N="198" REF="005439_0213_101832ff46ff1b70">
before we do this; but out of a Sen&s;e of our Mi&s;ery, make Ha&s;te to Chri&s;t to do it for us: And awakened Sinners may, by the Help of that <HI>Grace of God,</HI> which they &s;hould <HI>not receive in vain,</HI> do thus. Tho' their Hearts are not yet changed by the Grace of Regeneration; yet they may go to him for that Grace. When God requires this of us, he requires not what is above our Power, and impo&s;&s;ible for us, being furni&s;hed with that mentioned Grace of his, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.1. Tho' we cannot regenerate our &s;elves, yet it is not true, that we cannot ap|ply our &s;elves to Chri&s;t to work this great Change in us by his Spirit. And he invites and requires us thus to do; and has promi&s;ed, that if we do, he will not <HI>ca&s;t us out,</HI> John 6.37.</P>
<P>Let this Doctrine be owned and preached among us, to awakened Sinners, tho' un&s;anctified, that we may thereby encourage them to lay hold on God's Mercy; and it is po&s;&s;ible <HI>Arminians</HI> may then think, that they have far le&s;s to cavil again&s;t in our Doctrine of <HI>Rege|neration,</HI> than they &s;hould have if this were denied. I am in Hopes, that if this Truth were duly acknowledged, &s;uch as are di&s;po&s;ed to <HI>Arminiani&s;m</HI> among us, would be more inclined to receive our Doc|trine, in &s;uch Articles of it as are indeed e&s;&s;ential to it.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> There is one Point more, which is very e&s;&s;ential to the Scheme which I have endeavoured to explain and confirm; which be|ing allowed, and clearly a&s;&s;erted among us, would have a great Ten|dency to gain over to us &s;uch as lean towards <HI>Arminiani&s;m</HI>; and make them more favourably inclined towards our Doctrine: And this is, That <HI>God does not either by his Decree, or the Execution of it, lay a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity on any of his Creatures to &s;in again&s;t him.</HI> This is one of the Things, about which the <HI>Arminians</HI> contend very earne&s;tly with <HI>Cal|vini&s;ts,</HI> with Relation to our Doctrine: And tho' much of what they &s;ay on this Head, is, if I mi&s;take not, very unju&s;t; yet on the other Hand, I am of Opinion that &s;ome <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> have &s;aid Things with Re&s;pect to God's Decree, which have given too much Occa&s;ion of Offence to tho&s;e who differ in Judgment from them. If it were granted on our Part, (1) That God does neither in his Decree, nor in the Execution of it, take away the Liberty of free Agents, &s;uch as Men and Angels are. (2) That when it is &s;aid, that God <HI>wills</HI> or <HI>decrees</HI> the Actions of &s;inful Men, this mu&s;t not be under&s;tood of an <HI>effective</HI> Decree, but <HI>permi&s;&s;ive</HI> only: The Nature of divine Permi&s;&s;ion being rightly under&s;tood. (3) That by that efficiency of God, whereby he executeth his Decree, he does not by any Action of his, lay his Creatures under a Nece&s;&s;ity of doing Actions wherein they &s;in again&s;t him: The Concour&s;e of the fir&s;t Cau&s;e with the &s;econd, does
<PB N="199" REF="005439_0214_10183300d61244c0">
not infer this. If the&s;e Things were well a&s;&s;erted and explained, it would, I think, tend much to quiet the Minds of &s;uch as are apt to be &s;tumbled at the Doctrine of <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> about them.</P>
<P>What I have briefly &s;aid of &s;uch a Tendency, in this E&s;&s;ay, is not only de&s;igned as a Te&s;timony to the Truth; but as what I hope, if allowed to be agreeable thereunto, might in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;erve to quiet the tumultuating Thoughts of tho&s;e who have entertained &s;uch an Opinion of the Doctrine of God's Decree and Providence, as does not become the infinite Perfections of his Nature; and who are di&s;|plea&s;ed at &s;uch as maintain the Truth in the&s;e Points.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>THE SEVENTH USE</HI> of the Doctrine pleaded for. An Exhortation, with Directions, to &s;uch as are yet in a State of Nature, to comply with the Terms on which Salvation is offered to them in the Go&s;pel.</HEAD>
<P>_TO encourage Sinners to endeavour that which they are now exhorted to, has been the principal End at which I have aimed in the doctrinal Part of this E&s;&s;ay: And in order hereunto, I think I have plainly &s;hewed, that even the Grace of Regenera|tion it &s;elf is compri&s;ed in the Salvation offered; and con&s;equently not included nor implied in the Condition on which the Offer is made, nor nece&s;&s;ary in order to a Compliance with it; &s;o that for Want of it, Sinners &s;hould have no Power to comply with the Terms of the new Covenant.</P>
<P>It therefore now only remains incumbent on me, that I endeavour to per&s;uade &s;uch as are &s;till in a State of Nature, unregenerate and unju&s;tified, to endeavour to comply with the Terms on which God offers to &s;ave them, <HI>i. e.</HI> to ju&s;tify and regenerate them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>If God offers &s;uch a Salvation to Sinners in a conditional Covenant, as I have well proved he does, they have no Rea&s;on to expect it in
<PB N="200" REF="005439_0215_101833026328cb20">
any other Way, than in that in which it is thus offered to them. It mu&s;t needs, therefore, be a Matter of va&s;t Importance, that tho&s;e, unto whom this Offer is made, do comply with the Terms or Con|ditions on which Salvation is thus offered to them.</P>
<P>That there are in the World many &s;uch as this Exhortation is di|rected to, is too evident. There are Multitudes who&s;e irreligious and unholy Lives &s;hew them to be of this Number. And be&s;ides this, Men may have gone far in the Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, and in the Practice of the external Duties of it; and yet have not hitherto ful|filled the Conditions of the new Covenant, nor obtained a Right and Title to the Benefits of it; and if they &s;hall never do this, they will be exceeding mi&s;erable, and that for ever.</P>
<P>But the Mi&s;ery of &s;uch both in Re&s;pect of Lo&s;s and Sen&s;e, is not what I intend here to enlarge upon, this being very well done by many others.</P>
<P>What I here intend, is to offer &s;ome Things by Way of Exhorta|tion and Direction to tho&s;e unto whom this Part of my Di&s;cour&s;e is directed. Unto &s;uch I then &s;ay what here follows.</P>
<P>DIRECTION I.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider well what a mi&s;erable State you are in before, and until, you have complied with the Terms of the new Covenant. An un|ju&s;tified and an unregenerate State, is a very mi&s;erable State indeed. Such, whatever outward Privileges they may enjoy, are &s;till in a State of Condemnation; and <HI>the Wrath of God abideth on them,</HI> John 3.18. and Ver&s;e 36. Such are al&s;o un&s;anctified and unholy; and &s;o uncapable of the Enjoyment of God, and &s;uch Communion with him as true Saints may enjoy, either in this Life or that to come; and are liable to the Torments of the Damned, to be &s;uffered in Hell to all Eternity. If you are &s;till in a State of Nature, this is your Ca&s;e; and it is nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould be &s;en&s;ible of it; for if you will not apply your &s;elves in good Earne&s;t to work out your own Salva|tion, nor endeavour to perform the Condition of the new Covenant, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> indeed &s;o much as enquire <HI>what you &s;hall do to be &s;aved,</HI> as they did <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37. and he in <HI>Acts</HI> 16.30. you mu&s;t mi&s;erably peri&s;h for ever.</P>
<P>Such therefore as are &s;till in an unregenerate State, &s;hould meditate Terror, as in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 33.18. They &s;hould con&s;ider the Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s of God, the Strictne&s;s of his Law, his perfect Knowledge of all that Men do, the Judgment to come, the Puni&s;hment that will be inflicted on all &s;uch as die in their Sins; and that this will be the
<PB N="201" REF="005439_0216_1018330723b670d8">
woful Ca&s;e of all that comply not with the Terms of the new Co|venant. By &s;uch Con&s;iderations they &s;hould endeavour to get a deep Sen&s;e of their mi&s;erable State by Nature: For while Men &s;ay they are <HI>rich, and increa&s;ed in Goods, and have need of Nothing; and know not that they are wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and naked,</HI> as in <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.17. they will never follow the Advice given them in the next Words, Ver&s;e 18. <HI>I coun&s;el thee to buy of me Gold tried in the Fire, that thou may&s;t be rich; and white Raiment, that thou may&s;t be clothed, and that the Shame of thy Nakedne&s;s do not appear; and anoint thine Eyes with Eye-Salve, that thou may&s;t &s;ee</HI>: For <HI>they that are whole, need not the Phy&s;ician, but they that are &s;ick,</HI> Matth. 9.12.</P>
<P>DIRECTION II. Con&s;ider well, and rightly under&s;tand, what it is that God requires of you, in order to your Salvation. Take heed le&s;t you be mi&s;taken in the <HI>Terms</HI> of the new Covenant. If you are mi&s;taken in this, the Mi&s;take may be fatal to you. There are here two Ways in which Per&s;ons may be mi&s;taken to their own Hurt. As (1) by thinking the Terms &s;o low, that Per&s;ons may attain to, and perform what they think is required, and yet never be &s;aved: As when Per&s;ons think an external Reformation will an&s;wer the End, without any Heart-Reformation; and &s;o have no Regard to the <HI>inner Man,</HI> but content them&s;elves with &s;uch an Amendment of their Lives, that Men cannot accu&s;e them; but take no Care to do what is required in Jer. 4.14. <HI>O</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>wa&s;h thine Heart from Wickedne&s;s, that thou may&s;t be &s;aved: How long &s;hall thy vain Thoughts lodge within thee!</HI> And Ezek. 18.31. &mdash;<HI>Make you a new Heart, and a new Spirit; for why will ye die, O Hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael! Joel 2.13. <HI>Rent your Hearts, and not your Garments; and turn to the Lord thy God</HI>&mdash;. Ob&s;erve that here is Heart-Humiliation and Reformation required; yet I do not think that Sinners in the&s;e and &s;uch like Texts, are required to regenerate them&s;elves; which never any Sinner did or will do. There is a Re|formation of the Heart which is a Work very much &s;hort of, and in|feriour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, the great Work of Regeneration, which God only can work. Sinners may very much reform and amend their own Hearts, as well as their external Actions. Such as plea&s;e may for this &s;ee the Supplement to Mr. POOL's Engli&s;h Notes, on the mentioned <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.31. There is &s;uch a Thing as a <HI>moral</HI> as well as a <HI>gracious</HI> Sin|cerity; and the <HI>former</HI> of the&s;e God requires Sinners, by the Help of his common Grace, to work upon their own Hearts, but not the <HI>latter: This</HI> he re&s;erves to him&s;elf as his own Prerogative, as appears in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 11.19. and 36.26. Wherefore (2) Per&s;ons may al&s;o wrong them&s;elves greatly, by &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>that</HI> to be required of them which is not. If Sinners &s;uppo&s;e, that God requires of them, as the
<PB N="202" REF="005439_0217_1018330bcf487da8">
Condition of his Covenant, that which no Sinner ever did, or can do; no, not by Grace received from God him&s;elf, it is no wonder if they are di&s;couraged, and never attempt this.</P>
<P>And here I will mention two Things which I &s;uppo&s;e God never required of any Sinner, in order to his Salvation. As (1) God never required any Sinner to <HI>regenerate</HI> him&s;elf. I do not under&s;tand that God requires Men them&s;elves to work that great Change which is wrought in Men's Regeneration; or &s;o much as to have any Hand in it. <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> I think, generally own, that in this the Soul is wholly <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI>; and I cannot but under&s;tand the Scripture to &s;peak of it as &s;uch a Work, in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 11.19. and 36.26. before mentioned; al&s;o Jer. 31.18. <HI>Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned</HI>; and this is &s;poken of as the Effect of the mighty Power of God, in the Texts be|fore quoted. This therefore is a Work which I cannot think God requires Sinners them&s;elves to perform. (2) I do not think that God requires Sinners to <HI>exerci&s;e &s;aving Grace,</HI> while they have it not. One of my Rea&s;ons, is, becau&s;e this is phy&s;ically impo&s;&s;ible; as im|po&s;&s;ible as it is for a Man void of natural Life, to act and move him|&s;elf. Another Rea&s;on of this may be, that it &s;eems to imply a plain Contradiction, as much as it is for a Per&s;on to <HI>&s;ee</HI> while he is <HI>blind.</HI> If God gives a Man Grace, he can exerci&s;e it, but he cannot be enabled to exerci&s;e Grace while he has it not: Neither does God require this of any Man living. Man's pre&s;ent Duty, while unre|generate, is not to exerci&s;e that Kind of Grace which he is without; but to wait on God in the U&s;e of Means for the obtaining of it; attending the Ordinances in&s;tituted by him for that End, and per|forming the Duties unto that End demanded of him, as hearing and reading his Word, meditating on it, and calling on him for his Ble&s;|&s;ing on the Means of Grace, and praying earne&s;tly to him for the Par|don of his Sins, for Chri&s;t's Sake, and to give him his Holy Spirit in the converting and &s;aving Influences of it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now the&s;e are Duties which Per&s;ons by the Help of common Grace may perform.</P>
<P>DIRECTION III. Con&s;ider well, and under&s;tand, how very difficult the Conditions required are to be performed. Tho' I &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e Con|ditions may be complied with, by the Help of common Grace, by Per&s;ons not yet born of the Spirit; becau&s;e if the&s;e Conditions are complied with by any, it mu&s;t be in order to their Regeneration; and &s;o before, not after, that Work is wrought in them. Tho' therefore I affirm, that the&s;e Conditions are not &s;uch as the Unregenerate cannot, by the Help of common Grace, perform; yet I by no Means &s;ay, that the Conditions required in order to their Salvation, and con&s;equently in order to their Regeneration, are &s;uch as may by them be ea&s;ily
<PB N="203" REF="005439_0218_1018107642b21428">
complied with, while they are in a State of Nature. Even tho&s;e Duties which unregenerate Per&s;ons can, by the Help of common Grace, perform, and mu&s;t perform, if they would be &s;aved, are very contrary to Fle&s;h and Blood, and difficult to be performed by them. That Corruption which they have in them, greatly di&s;inclines them to the Performance of them. They do not find their Hearts well in|clined to read the Word of God, hear it preached, and meditate on it; and to examine them&s;elves, and pray earne&s;tly to God for the convincing and converting Influences of his Holy Spirit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Tho' Men may po&s;&s;ibly do the&s;e Things by &s;uch Help as the Unregenerate may receive; yet this is to them hard Work: There is a hard Striving required to it, and great Self-Denial in it. Even in &s;uch Actions of the Unregenerate, there is a <HI>Wre&s;tling with Fle&s;h and Blood,</HI> and <HI>again&s;t Principalities,</HI> and <HI>Powers,</HI> and <HI>again&s;t the Rulers of the Darkne&s;s of this World,</HI> and <HI>again&s;t &s;piritual Wickedne&s;s in high Places,</HI> Eph. 6.12. Which Words I think may be under&s;tood not of the Regenerate only, but of the Unregenerate al&s;o, when awakened, and excited to begin to <HI>work out their own Salvation</HI>; and to begin to <HI>pre&s;s into</HI> (or towards) <HI>the Kingdom of God,</HI> Luke 16.16. and to <HI>&s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate,</HI> Luke 13.24. The Kingdom of Hea|ven mu&s;t be taken by <HI>Violence</HI> by &s;uch as would enjoy it; and this Violence mu&s;t be u&s;ed in order to Men's obtaining; not after they have it, <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.12. <HI>Striving to enter</HI> into it, is in order to En|trance; not after Per&s;ons are in it. <HI>The &s;trait Gate</HI> and <HI>the narrow Way</HI> mu&s;t be found, entred into, and walked in, before we enter in|to Life, and in order to it; and not only after we have obtained it. Nor does the Difficulty of this con&s;i&s;t in the Work of Regeneration it &s;elf, which Men them&s;elves have no Hand in, it being wholly per|formed by God for them; but in the Duties that are preparatory to it.</P>
<P>It is dangerous for Per&s;ons in an unregenerate State, to think the Duties and Conditions ea&s;y, which are required of them in order to their Salvation; for this tends to make them &s;lighty and carele&s;s about them, and to occa&s;ion their delaying to perform them.</P>
<P>DIRECTION IV. You mu&s;t confe&s;s, and be very &s;en&s;ible, that there is nothing of Merit in any Thing required of you, or that can be done by you, in order to your Salvation. It is mo&s;t evident, that the Conditions required in a Covenant of Grace, can have Nothing of Merit in them. Even the Condition of the Covenant of Works had Nothing of Merit in it, much le&s;s can the Condition of the Covenant of Grace have any Merit in that. Indeed, if Grace were given according to Works, that would, according to the Language of the Scriptures, and good
<PB N="204" REF="005439_0219_10183310984e6598">
Divines, be according to Merit; and then it would not be <HI>of Grace,</HI> but <HI>of Debt,</HI> as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.6. But mu&s;t this be the Ca&s;e, if any Conditions are required in the Covenant of Grace? Will it then fol|low, that his Salvation is <HI>of Debt,</HI> and not of Grace? This cannot be allowed, and has been &s;ufficiently di&s;proved in Part I. Chap. III. and Part II. Chap. XVII. A Thing may be not at all the le&s;s <HI>of Grace,</HI> becau&s;e it is given in the Way of a Covenant, on &s;ome Con|dition to be performed by him that &s;hall receive it. When Sinners are required to &s;eek the Lord for his Grace and Mercy, thro' the Merits of his dear Son, who has obeyed the Law, and &s;uffered the Penalty of it for them, there is not the lea&s;t Room for them to imagine they can by this merit any Thing at his Hands. Repentance for Sins committed, believing in a Redeemer for Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Life, and begging Pardon, have no Appearance of Merit in them. Let not unconverted Sinners think they merit any Thing at God's Hands, when they do this. I am &s;ure they have no Rea&s;on for it. Let them, on the contrary, plead with God the Riches and Freedom of his Grace, and the Merits of his Son, when they are &s;eeking to him for his &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings and everla&s;ting Mercies, and that will be the Way to obtain them.</P>
<P>DIRECTION V. Take heed you do not, by living in the Practice of any known Sin, provoke God to deny or withold his &s;pecial and everla&s;ting Mercies from you. Sinners have no Rea&s;on to expect that God will par|don their Iniquities, and &s;anctify their Hearts by his Holy Spirit, &s;o long as they indulge them&s;elves in any known Sin, either of Omi&s;&s;ion or Commi&s;&s;ion. <HI>Paul</HI> was indeed very &s;uddenly converted: He was going on in an evil Way, <HI>Acts</HI> Chap. 9. But he him&s;elf declares, he <HI>obtained Mercy becau&s;e he did it ignorantly,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.13. Nor was his &s;aving Conver&s;ion (I am per&s;uaded) &s;o very &s;udden that there was no preparatory Work going before it, tho' but of &s;hort Continuance. That Out-cry of his, when trembling and a&s;toni&s;hed he &s;aid, <HI>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</HI> was, I &s;uppo&s;e, of the &s;ame Kind with their's, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37. and his Chap. 16.30. Compare tho&s;e Scriptures and &s;ee how much the Pa&s;&s;ages are alike. I think it is very probable he was then born both of Water and of the Spirit, when <HI>Ananias</HI> bap|tized him, &s;aying to him, as in Acts 9.17. <HI>Brother</HI> Saul, <HI>the Lord, (even Je&s;us that appeared unto thee in the Way as thou came&s;t) hath &s;ent me, that thou mighte&s;t receive thy Sight, and be filled with the holy Gho&s;t.</HI> After which Words, it followeth, Ver&s;e 18. <HI>And immediately there fell from his Eyes, as it had been Scales; and he received Sight forthwith, and aro&s;e and was baptized.</HI> Men mu&s;t fir&s;t <HI>turn at God's Reproof,</HI> before they may expect that he will <HI>pour out his Spirit unto them, and make known his
<PB N="205" REF="005439_0220_10183316864de058">
Words unto them,</HI> as in Prov. 1.23. If we have <HI>exceeding great and precious Promi&s;es, by which we may be Partakers of the divine Nature,</HI> we may not expect to receive this Benefit, till we have <HI>fir&s;t e&s;caped the Cor|ruption that is in the World thro' Lu&s;t,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.4. They are mi&s;taken who think, God's ordinary Way is fir&s;t to <HI>regenerate</HI> Men, and by that Means to <HI>reform</HI> their vicious Lives. God's Way is the Rever&s;e of this: He fir&s;t humbles and reforms Sinners, and then pours out his Spirit on them, and &s;avingly converts them. They mu&s;t not live in &s;uch abominable Practices, as are mentioned in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.9. if they de&s;ign to &s;ee or get into the Kingdom of God, by obtaining true and &s;aving Grace, as in <HI>Mark</HI> 12.34.</P>
<P>DIRECTION VI. Delay not your Repentance till it be too late: I mean, 'till it is too late for you to repent, or 'till your Sea&s;on for it be pa&s;t and gone. Now there are two Ca&s;es in which this may befall you, <HI>viz.</HI> (1) Death may overtake you while you delay it, and then you have lo&s;t your Opportunity for it for ever! Oh! take heed of this. Remember that awful Word in Prov. 27.1. <HI>Boa&s;t not thy &s;elf of To-morrow; for thou knowe&s;t not what a Day may bring forth.</HI> And forget not that of the Apo&s;tle, James 4.14. <HI>Ye know not what &s;hall be on the Morrow: For what is your Life? It is even a Vapour that ap|peareth for a little Time, and then vani&s;heth away.</HI> Tremble at the Tho't of that in Prov. 29.1. <HI>He that being often reproved, hardneth his Neck, &s;hall &s;uddenly be de&s;troyed, and that without Remedy.</HI> Think &s;e|riou&s;ly what Multitudes there are now roaring in Hell, becau&s;e they wickedly delayed their Repentance, till Death overtook them; and that after Death there is no Sea&s;on for Repentance unto Life. Be per&s;uaded to do as <HI>David</HI> did, P&s;al. 119.59, 60. <HI>I tho't on my Ways and turned my Feet into thy Te&s;timonies. I made Ha&s;te, and delayed not to keep thy Commandments.</HI> (2) The holy Spirit may be finally taken from you, if you continue long to re&s;i&s;t him, and quench his Motions, by an ob&s;tinate delaying of your Repentance; and then you are un|done for ever. It will therefore be your Duty and Intere&s;t, &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider &s;uch Texts of Scripture as hold forth the Danger of his ut|terly for&s;aking you, le&s;t he forever leave you. To this End, ponder and lay to Heart, what we have in Gen. 6.3. <HI>My Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with Man.</HI> P&s;al. 81.11, 12. <HI>My People would not hearken to my Voice, and</HI> I&s;rael <HI>would none of me. So I gave them up to their own Heart's Lu&s;ts; and they walked in their own Coun&s;els.</HI> Ezek. 24.13. <HI>Becau&s;e I have purged thee, and thou wa&s;t not purged, thou &s;halt not be purged any more, 'till I have cau&s;ed my Fury to re&s;t upon thee.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="005439_0221_101833187b1a5730">DIRECTION VII. Per&s;evere in well doing, when you have be|gun well; and take heed of Apo&s;tacy. Some begin well, but fall away and lo&s;e all they have done. This is the &s;ad Ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed in <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4, 5, 6. and in 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.20, 21, 22. al&s;o in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.24, 26. And I doubt not al&s;o in <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.38, 39. Nor is this a Suppo&s;ition of what never falls out: There be many to whom it may be truly &s;aid, as in <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.4. <HI>Ye are fallen from Grace</HI>: And this not only on Ac|count of fundamental Errors in Doctrine, which they embrace; but al&s;o in Re&s;pect of abominable Practices into which they fall, and in which they continue, as in the mentioned Text, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.20. Not that regenerate and ju&s;tified Per&s;ons ever do thus, or are liable to it; for the&s;e are all <HI>kept by the Power of God, thro' Faith unto Salvation,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.5. They are become <HI>Pillars in the Temple of God, and &s;hall go no more out,</HI> Rev. 3.12. I cannot believe, that the Suppo&s;itions of Apo&s;tacy which we have in Scripture, relate to the Regenerate, who are expre&s;ly &s;ecured again&s;t it; but to tho&s;e, on whom a Work of common Grace only has been wro't, and &s;o are liable to fall away: And &s;uch had need beware, le&s;t <HI>being led away by the Error of the Wicked, they fall from their own Stedfa&s;tne&s;s,</HI> 2 Pet. 3.17 At lea&s;t, I think that this may be accommodated to the Condition of the Unre|generate, under a Work preparatory to Regeneration, and mu&s;t be &s;o, if a total Apo&s;tacy be intended. It is certain that many Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion have totally fallen away, after great Convictions and Re|formation. Nor is the Promi&s;e of Salvation made to any Mea&s;ure of &s;uch Grace as the Unregenerate have; but to &s;uch as per&s;evere in that Way of well-doing, which &s;ome who are not &s;avingly converted, are engaged in, as I think I have &s;ufficiently &s;hewed, Part II. Chap. XIV. To &s;uch I &s;ay, as in Heb. 10.35, 36. <HI>Ca&s;t not away therefore your Confidence, which hath great Recompence of Reward. For ye have need of Patience, that after ye have done the Will of God, ye might receive the Promi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>DIRECTION VIII. Rely on the free and &s;overeign Grace of God, to make you willing to attend the Duties required of you, in or|der to your Salvation. Acknowledge al&s;o, that your doing &s;o depends ab&s;olutely on his Good-will and Plea&s;ure. Tho' God has promi&s;ed that he will &s;ave you, if you perform what is to that End required of you; yet he has made no Promi&s;e to you, that you &s;hall perform the Condition on which Salvation is offered to you. Whether he will effectually incline your Hearts to this, is ab&s;olutely at his Liberty. It is not con&s;i&s;tent with the Nature of a conditional Promi&s;e, that he that propo&s;eth it &s;hould engage him&s;elf to the Per&s;on unto whom it is made, for both the Condition required, and the Promi&s;e made on that
<PB N="207" REF="005439_0222_1018331ba8f48328">
Condition. To &s;uppo&s;e, that in the conditional Promi&s;e of the Go&s;|pel, God promi&s;eth Sinners both the&s;e, is a plain Contradiction. Tho' I cannot tell you, that if you fail or fall &s;hort of the Grace of God, the Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e you have no Power to comply with the Terms of the new Covenant; yet I can tell you, that your doing this depends ab&s;olutely on God's free and &s;overeign Grace; who, if ever you are &s;aved, mu&s;t <HI>work in you both to will and to do, according to his own good Will and Plea&s;ure.</HI> Here that is applicable, Rom. 9.16. <HI>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that &s;heweth Mercy.</HI> Per&s;ons may have Power to comply with the Terms of the new Covenant, and yet never do it. There is a great deal more to be done for a Sinner in order to his Salvation, than the bare giving him &s;uch a Power; even an effectual Per&s;ua&s;ion to do the Things required of him; which tho' he has Power to perform, yet he never would without &s;uch Per&s;ua&s;ion. Let therefore every unregenerate Sinner humbly and freely confe&s;s, that after all that God has hitherto done for him, he &s;hall mi&s;erably peri&s;h, and that for ever, if he does not, in his infinite Mercy, effectually per&s;uade him to do what is incumbent on him in order to his eternal Happine&s;s. And I do mo&s;t freely &amp; heartily ack|nowledge, that a Soul that is bro't to this, is in the mo&s;t likely Way to obtain &s;aving Grace and Mercy; and &s;uch an one &s;eems not to be far from the Kingdom of God. If &s;ome believe and are &s;aved, when o|thers neglect the Salvation offered to them, and eternally peri&s;h, a &s;overeign God mu&s;t have the Glory of <HI>making the Difference</HI>: Tho&s;e who believe and are &s;aved, would have done no more than tho&s;e who remain Unbelievers and are damned, if God did no more for them. And we may to this Ca&s;e apply tho&s;e Words of our glorious Lord, with very little Variation, Matth. 11.25, 26. <HI>I thank thee, O Fa|ther, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e Things from the Wi&s;e and Prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them unto Babes. Even &s;o, Fa|ther, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy Sight.</HI> It mu&s;t be &s;o, and it is be&s;t it &s;hould be &s;o: It is for our Intere&s;t to acknowledge it, and that our Hearts &s;hould acquie&s;ce in it, and to it &s;ay, AMEN.</P>
<P>DIRECTION IX. While you &s;eek to God for his Salvation, rely on his Mercy, &amp; on the Merits of his dear Son; and plead with him his Promi&s;es of &s;aving all &s;uch as diligently &s;eek him. They are not only the Rege|nerate and Ju&s;tified that may do this: Tho&s;e who have not yet &s;ecured the Salvation of their own Souls, are bound &s;o to do; and it is not impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould. They cannot indeed do this in that gracious and holy Manner, that Per&s;ons already in a State of Grace can; but that they cannot do it at all, is not to be allowed. The Unregenerate may have a Hope and Tru&s;t in God, an&s;werable to that Per&s;ua&s;ion of
<PB N="208" REF="005439_0223_1018331da169d928">
his Power and Mercy, which by Means of the glorious Go&s;pel, they have attained to. If this were not &s;o, how &s;hould they wait on God in the U&s;e of Means, for the Salvation of their Souls? which many unregenerate Per&s;ons do. Such may al&s;o plead with God the con|ditional Promi&s;es of his Covenant, made to &s;uch as diligently &s;eek him: Such as we have in <HI>Matth.</HI> 7.7,&mdash;11. <HI>Luke</HI> 11.9,&mdash;13. <HI>Prov.</HI> 23, 4, 5. And unto awakened unregenerate Souls, I &s;ay, Do not think it impo&s;&s;ible to do this, by the Help of God's Grace, before you are born of the Spirit, or &s;avingly converted, and while your Day of Grace la&s;teth, and God is by his Word and Spirit &s;triving with you. Let the Promi&s;es God has made encourage you to do &s;o: <HI>For he has not &s;aid to the Seed of</HI> Jacob, (of which many are unconverted) <HI>&s;eek ye me in vain:</HI> Therefore <HI>&s;eek the Lord while he may be found</HI>&mdash;I&s;ai. 55.6. Let nothing di&s;courage you from endeavouring to do &s;o: And while you are thus <HI>drawing nigh unto God, he will draw nigh unto you,</HI> James 4.8. Tru&s;t in God, and he will not fail you. P&s;al. 34.8. <HI>O ta&s;te and &s;ee that the Lord is good: Ble&s;&s;ed is the Man that putteth his Tru&s;t in him.</HI></P>
