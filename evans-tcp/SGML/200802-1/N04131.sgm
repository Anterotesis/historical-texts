<Q><BIBL>LUKE xv. from the 11th Ver&s;e to the End.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> informs us, that <HI>it is a faithful Saying, and worthy of all Accepta|tion, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the World to &s;ave poor Sinners.</HI> Our dear Redeemer had no other End in coming from Heaven to us, but to place poor Sinners in Heaven again: He led a pain|ful per&s;ecuted Life, and died an ignominious Death, for our Sake. As this was the End of his Coming, &s;o it was the End of his Preaching: He was conti|nually &s;ounding the glad Tydings of Salvation to poor convinced Sinners, giving all Encouragement from their Mi&s;ery, and at the &s;ame Time denounc|ing Wrath again&s;t tho&s;e who tru&s;ted in them&s;elves that they were Righteous, and would not come out of them&s;elves, and lay hold on his Righteou&s;ne&s;s. For this Purpo&s;e the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS put forth many in&s;tructing Parables; no le&s;s than three in the Chap|ter out of which the Words read are taken.</P>
<P>Methinks of all the Parables that JESUS ever put forth, that which I have now cho&s;en as the Subject of your pre&s;ent Meditation, if it be lawful to com|pare &s;piritual Things with &s;piritual, excels other Pa|rables <HI>as one Star differs from another in Glory.</HI> I think it would be an Impeachment on your Judg|ment, I &s;hould think I were acting contrary to Charity, e&s;pecially in your Country, where I hope you are better acquainted with your Bibles than &s;ome others are, than to think you need to be informed to what Parable the Text belongs: It belongs to that Soul-comforting,
<PB N="3" REF="005089_0003_1016A349BB469F20">
Soul-reviving Parable of the Prodigal Son, wherein the LORD JESUS CHRIST di&s;plays the Compa&s;&s;ion of GOD to poor returning Sinners, in the mo&s;t lively Colours. I pray GOD by his Holy SPIRIT, may write it upon the Table of all your Hearts.</P>
<P>I intend, then, at this Time to make &s;ome Re|marks upon the whole Parable, and then &s;hall con|clude with an Exhortation to you all to come to the dear REDEEMER. And I pray GOD that Joy may be in Heaven this Afternoon over &s;ome of you, re|penting and coming home to GOD.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, To make &s;ome Remarks on the Pa|rable it&s;elf. I begin at the 11th Ver&s;e. <HI>And he &s;aid,</HI> JESUS &s;aid, <HI>A certain Man had two Sons.</HI> By <HI>two Sons</HI> you are here to under&s;tand two different Characters: The <HI>Publicans,</HI> who feeling their Mi&s;ery were willing to lay hold on CHRIST; and the ca|villing carping <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who tru&s;ting in them&s;elves that they were righteous, de&s;pi&s;ed the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of JESUS CHRIST, de&s;pi&s;ed others, crying out with the &s;elf-conceited Hypocrites, <HI>Come not near me, for I am holier than you.</HI> I &s;hall fir&s;t touch at the younger Son.</P>
<P><HI>The younger &s;aid to his Father, Father give me the Portion of Goods that falleth to me.</HI> We may &s;uppo&s;e his Father was a holy pious Man; one that had taken up <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>'s Re&s;olution; Whatever others might do, <HI>as for him and his Hou&s;e, they would &s;erve the LORD.</HI> We may &s;uppo&s;e he kept up Family-Religion, took Care to breed up his Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD: But his younger Son, like &s;ome of our young Gentlemen, could not bear &s;o much Re&s;traint upon him, by an
<PB N="4" REF="005089_0004_1016A34C76BDEA80">
old doting enthu&s;ia&s;tick Father; he could not bear to have Religion always talk'd of in the Family; he thought his Father righteous over-much; impa|tient of religious Re&s;traints; he de&s;ires to be left to his own Heart Lu&s;ts; and therefore &s;aid to his Father, <HI>Give me the Portion of Goods that falleth to me.</HI> My dear Friends, this is the Temper of all of us by Nature; we deal thus with our heavenly Father: Tho' God impo&s;eth nothing upon us but what is really perfective of our Nature; tho' God bids us ab&s;tain from nothing but what would hurt us; yet we look upon God as a hard rigorous Task-Ma&s;ter. If we were left to our own Choice, we would de|&s;ire God to leave us to our &s;elves: The Language of our Hearts by Nature is, <HI>Lord, depart from us, we de&s;ire not the Knowledge of thy Law:</HI> The Lan|guage of our Hearts is, Father, Leave us to our &s;elves. But, my dear Friends, you cannot put up a better Petition, if ye have a Mind to be happy, than this; Lord, however thou deal with us, leave us not to our own Choice. What this young Man &s;aid, we all &s;ay.</P>
<P>We may &s;uppo&s;e it troubled the Father to have &s;uch a wicked Child; however, hoping that the Prodigal might yet be reclaimed, and mend his Life, the Father gave him what he de&s;ired; <HI>and &s;o divided unto him his Living.</HI> You &s;ee what we &s;hall do, if God Almighty leave us to our own Hearts Lu&s;ts; for we are told in the 13th Ver&s;e, <HI>That not many Days after the younger Son gathered all together, and went into a far Country, and &s;pent his Sub&s;tance with riotous living. Not many Days after,</HI> it's taken parti|cular Notice of, for he was impatient of Re&s;traint, every Day was a Year while he was in his Father's
<PB N="5" REF="005089_0005_1016A34E05579D60">
Hou&s;e; he would have went away immediately, but he &s;taid &s;ometime to get a proper Equipage, &s;uitable to the Quality of the Son of &s;uch a Father. Not ma|ny Days after <HI>he gathered all together,</HI> leaves nothing behind, that he might be out of his Father's Reach. <HI>He took his Journey into a far Country,</HI> It's remarka|ble, the way of Sin is down the Hill, when you be|gin to &s;in, ye know not where ye will &s;top, you will go into a far Country, far from God; he was afraid if he &s;taid longer at home, he would have his Father checking him, therefore he gets out of his hearing. This repre&s;ents the Heart of a Sinner, he finds Con|victions now and then coming upon him, &amp; &s;o would drink and whore, and go on in Sin, on purpo&s;e to &s;tifle his Convictions. <HI>He went into a far Country,</HI> and &s;ee what follows, <HI>he wa&s;ted his Sub&s;tance with riotous living.</HI> One would have thought he would have &s;top'd before his Goods were all wa&s;ted: But my dear Friends, there is &s;uch an Infatuation in Sin, there is &s;uch a &s;trong Propen&s;ity to Sin in our Heart, that without the almighty Power of God give a &s;top to our Will, tho' we know the End of Sin will be Damnation, yet we will Sin on, tho' we &s;hould be damned. This was the Ca&s;e of the young Prodigal. When his Sub&s;tance was wa&s;ting, one would have thought he would have &s;top'd before all was gone: But &s;ee how God hedged up his Way.</P>
<P>In the 14th Ver&s;e we are told <HI>When he had &s;pent all, there aro&s;e a mighty Famine in that Land, and he began to be in want.</HI> Here God was now bringing a Re&s;traint in order to bring him home. There was not only a Famine, but an extraordinary Famine; and then the Prodigal began to be in want. One would have thought that he &s;hould have begun to
<PB N="6" REF="005089_0006_1016A352628F6980">
think of coming home: But we &s;hall never come to Chri&s;t, till we think we mu&s;t be damned without Chri&s;t: Chri&s;t is beholden to none of us for coming to him. The Prodigal was in Want, but we do not hear of his beginning to think of coming Home. When People have &s;ome few Convictions floating upon the Surface of their Hearts, they begin to &s;ee the Evil of Sin; but their Goodne&s;s is like a Morn|ing Cloud that pa&s;&s;eth away, till Convictions fa&s;ten upon their Soul, and they &s;ee them&s;elves lo&s;t. The Prodigal &s;ees him&s;elf in Want, but he would not come home, &s;o long as he can &s;hift for him&s;elf: therefore we are told,</P>
<P>In the 15. Ver. <HI>He went and joined him&s;elf to a Citizen, and he &s;ent him into the Feilds to feed Swine.</HI> Are there any young Prodigals here that are &s;pending their Patrimony in riotous Living; &s;ee what this will bring them to. A Man that lives within Bounds, he may have none of the&s;e dreadful Things to &s;trug|gle with, that the&s;e poor Souls have, that are carried away Captive by the Devil. I know it by Experi|ence. Here a young Man finely equipped, with a fine Fortune, &s;ee what he is reduced to; was that proper Company for him? <HI>He joined him&s;elf to a Citizen of that Country, and he &s;ent him into the Field to feed Swine:</HI> And here he would have been contented to remain, if he could have been kept from Hunger.</P>
<P>We are told in the 16. Ver. <HI>He would fain have filled his Belly with the Husks that the Swine did eat, but no Man gave unto him.</HI> O what will Prodigality bring People to. The wi&s;e Man &s;ays, <HI>By Means of a whori&s;h Woman, a Man is brought to a Piece of Bread.</HI> Here, he that was u&s;ed to variety of Di&s;hes, cloathed in Purple and fine Linnen, &s;ee him now &s;itting with
<PB N="7" REF="005089_0007_1016A2DD21542678">
the Swine, envying the very Bea&s;ts the Husks on which they were feeding. He only wanted the Husks, he would be content to be kept from &s;tarving, with|out going home. <HI>But no Man gave unto him,</HI> &s;o much as the Husks. This plainly &s;hews, when we are coming to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, how GOD Almighty will make all Ways of e&s;caping good for nothing, till we come Home to CHRIST. Now this young Man might think all the&s;e Things were again&s;t him; but all the&s;e Things were intended for him, to bring him home to CHRIST. So a poor Sinner that is hedged in on every Side, will think, all is gone; but God is hedging up his Way. Here the poor Prodi|gal is &s;itting with the Swine: methinks I &s;ee him. What mu&s;t he do? He is brought to an Extremity; and this was God's Opportunity.</P>
<P>Ver. 17. <HI>When he came to him&s;elf.</HI> This is very remarkable. Pray, was the Prodigal be&s;ide him&s;elf? Before, he looked on his Father as a mad Man; as I believe Thou&s;ands now look upon the Mini&s;ters of JESUS CHRIST, as Fools, Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and mad Men. Thus this young Prodigal looked upon his Father. But the Father was the wi&s;e Man, and the Prodigal a Fool. You that now mock and &s;coff at the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, and join with your helli&s;h Companions, you will be made to cry out, We, not they, were Fools; how are they numbred among the Children of GOD. O may God bring you to your &s;elves. Here the Prodigal comes to him&s;elf. The Lu&s;t of the Eye, the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, and the Pride of Pride, did overcome him. But when God brings you to Death, when God di&s;robes you of all you have, then you will begin to &s;ee what a damnable Condition your Souls are in.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005089_0008_10166726C853CA48">Here &s;ays he, <HI>How many hired Servants of my Fa|ther have Bread enough and to &s;pare, and I peri&s;h with Hunger,</HI> He not only wanted Bread, and began to be in Want; but <HI>I peri&s;h,</HI> if I &s;tay here, <HI>with Hunger.</HI> You will never come to CHRIST, till you &s;ee your &s;elves peri&s;hing without him. <HI>I peri&s;h with Hunger.</HI> Now the Prodigal begins to con&s;ider the dreadful Condition he is in; but if he &s;tops here, he will not come home: However, he makes Re&s;olutions; and therefore we are told</P>
<P>In the 18th Ver. after he had con&s;idered his wretched State, <HI>I will ari&s;e and go to my Father, and &s;ay to him, Father, I have &s;inned again&s;t Heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy &s;on, &amp;c.</HI> He &s;aw him&s;elf ready to peri&s;h: O that &s;ome might give me Husks, that I may be kept from going home. Well, but he mu&s;t go home. Well, &s;ays he, <HI>I will ari&s;e, and go to my Father.</HI> It's remar|kable, tho' he had u&s;ed his Father &s;o ill, he calls him his Father: He had often tried his Father; who had often born with him: It broke in upon his Soul. Who knows but my Father may bear with me yet? I am &s;tarving here. What will he &s;ay? Will he plead Merit? No, he will aggravate what he has done, <HI>I will &s;ay, Father I have &s;inned again&s;t Heaven and before thee.</HI> This is remarkable: He had &s;inned again&s;t his Neighbour; he had &s;inned again&s;t him|&s;elf: but what grieves him mo&s;t is, that he had &s;in|ned again&s;t his Father, again&s;t Heaven; for whatever Harm we have done to our Neighbour or our &s;elves, it ultimately &s;trikes again&s;t God him&s;elf. It grieves him that he has offended his Father.</P>
<P><HI>Make me as one of thy hired &s;ervants.</HI> Some &s;up|po&s;e that this la&s;t Clau&s;e was the Relict of Self-Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="005089_0009_101667511470C5D8">
in the young Man's Heart. Thinks he, I will go home to my Father; I will ask Pardon for my Sin, but I will not be intirely beholden to him for my Living: I will Work a little for it; I will do &s;omething for my Bread. O but a Soul mu&s;t be brought low, before it is brought out of Self. This Self, you cannot tell how &s;ecretly it works; how much of Self is in the be&s;t Saints. He was not willing to accept a Pardon as a free Gift: no, &s;ays he, I will Work for it. We would fain have &s;ome Hand in our Salvation. Others &s;uppo&s;e it was the Re&s;ult of Humility in him: <HI>Make me as one of thy hired Servants:</HI> Deal with me as thou wilt; only let me come home unto thee: for a poor convinced Sinner will &s;ay, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI> He would rather be a Door-keeper in the Hou&s;e of God than dwell in Tents of Wickedne&s;s. Well, when the Prodigal's Convictions began to fa&s;ten, he &s;aid he would ari&s;e; and we &s;hall find that he actually did ari&s;e in the 21. Ver&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>And he aro&s;e and came to his Father.</HI> But who can tell how many bitter Throws this poor Man felt? What Convictions, what Convul&s;ions his Soul un|derwent, during his returning home. Sinners, you are going away from God, you are wandering into a far Country; but you will have many bitter Con|victions before you come again to JESUS CHRIST. He aro&s;e&punc; it is &s;aid, he was gone into a far Country; and we may &s;uppo&s;e was &s;ometime a coming home. Methinks, I &s;ee the poor Creature quite de&s;titute, quite helple&s;s; without Cloaths on his Back, with|out Shoes, &s;tinking, filthy all over. Methinks, I &s;ee him walking &s;lowly on: for Sin takes off our Chariot Wheels, and makes us drive heavily. Me|thinks,
<PB N="10" REF="005089_0010_1016A2ADA695C308">
I &s;ee the poor Creature in great Perplexity before he came to his Father's Hou&s;e. Sometimes Unbelief works; it can never be that my Father will forgive &s;uch a Wretch as I am. His old Sins &s;tare him in the Face; his Ingratitude &s;tares him: My Father hath forgiven me often, but he will ne|ver forgive me again. Methinks, I &s;ee him &s;tepping back, and weeping. When we look upon God as our Enemy, that very Look makes us fly from him. We &s;hall never come to God, till we look upon him as our Friend. But then, thinks he, if I do not go, I &s;hall certainly peri&s;h: But who knows but my Father will receive me. Then, methinks, I &s;ee him &s;tep up again; but then Pride of Heart ari&s;es; What, &s;hall I &s;toop before my Father's Servants? Can I humble my &s;elf before my Father's Gate; it's better to peri&s;h here. As many a Sinner when under Convictions, and has not got a Sen&s;e of Pardon, would rather be damned than come to JESUS CHRIST. But at la&s;t, well thinks he, I will go, it is better to do the meane&s;t thing with Shame; than to peri&s;h here: at la&s;t he gets up, and has many a weary Look, many a Fear, many a La&s;h of a &s;elf-condemned Con&s;cience: At la&s;t he comes to the Gate of his Father's Hou&s;e, <HI>He aro&s;e and came to his Fa|ther,</HI> fearing and trembling le&s;t his Father would not look upon him. But &s;ee the Heart of God to poor dejected &s;elf-condemned Sinners; &s;ee the Love of God to poor repenting Sinners; we are told, <HI>When he was yet a great Way off, his Father &s;aw him &amp; had Compa&s;&s;ion on him, and ran, &amp; fell on his Neck &amp; ki&s;&s;ed him.</HI> I believe never was &s;o much Affection expre&s;&s;ed in &s;o few Words. <HI>When he was yet a great Way off:</HI> Perhaps the Father was praying in the Field, or me|ditating
<PB N="11" REF="005089_0011_1016A2B0572A4088">
as <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> that his Prodigal might come home, putting up a Prayer to God, <HI>O that</HI> I&s;hmael <HI>might live before thee.</HI> And perhaps when he was praying, he turns his Head, and &s;ees his young Prodigal com|ing home. The Prodigal does not advance any fur|ther; Unbelief kept him back; I dare not approach him any more: Like a poor Sinner convinced of Sin, he dares not lay hold on Chri&s;t, tho' God bids him. Here the Father turning his Head, &s;ees a poor Creature quite di&s;figured, without Cloaths or Shoes: He won|ders who it is: He looks again, &amp; at la&s;t &s;ays, There are &s;ome Features of my Child. God can &s;ee all his Elect, tho' they are weltring in their Blood. One would have thought, when he &s;aw him, he would immediately go to the Hou&s;e, and bid the Dogs bark at him, and command the filthy Wretch to be gone to his Whores, and where he had &s;pent his Sub&s;tance in riotous Living. No, in&s;tead of that, <HI>when he &s;aw him he had Compa&s;&s;ion on him</HI>; his Bowels yearned to|wards him; his Heart was ready to di&s;&s;olve within him, like <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> when we are told his Bowels yern|ed toward his Brethren. Old as he was, <HI>he ran,</HI> he &s;aw his Prodigal unwilling to come; O thinks he, I will run and meet him. And when a poor Sinner is made willing to come, when he is about to come, God will &s;end his Spirit to fetch him home. <HI>He ran to him</HI>:One would have thought he would &s;ay, Go wa&s;h thy &s;elf, and then I will ki&s;s thee: No, the Fa|ther <HI>ran,</HI> and in an Exta&s;y of Love <HI>fell on his Neck</HI>; he threw him&s;elf on his Neck, filthy as it was; he &s;peaks not one Word, but &s;hews his Love; his Actions &s;peaks for him; with open Arms he embra|ced his filthy Son: Welcome, my Child, welcome home! There is not one Word of Reflection. No,
<PB N="12" REF="005089_0012_1016A2B1DDD1E170">
when you come to God, he will blot out all your Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, he will freely forgive your Sins, and your Iniquities he will remember no more. Well, one would think the Prodigal &s;hould have forgot his Purpo&s;e, My Father hath forgiven me, I need &s;ay no more. But where-ever God comes in a &s;aving Way to a poor Sinner, he is filled with &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of his Sin, that tho' God forgive him, he cannot forgive him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here the Prodigal &s;ays in the 21&s;t Ver&s;e, <HI>Father I have &s;inned again&s;t Heaven and in thy Sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</HI> This &s;hows us that we mu&s;t confe&s;s Sin, even after we know that our Sins are forgiven: That is &s;weet Humility, that re&s;ults from a Sen&s;e of God's Love. I appeal to you that know CHRIST, if it is not the &s;weete&s;t Hours with you, after ye have received Manife&s;tations from God, a breathing of God in your Soul; you feel your Souls melting, di&s;&s;olving in Love, and throwing your &s;elves at the Foot of &s;overeign Grace, Why me Lord, why me? And the more God pours in upon you, the more lowly ye are in your own Eyes. O that is a &s;weet Time, when the Soul is laid low, and di&s;&s;olved with a Sen&s;e of God's Love. Methinks, I &s;ee the Prodigal amazed that the Father &s;hould have thus embraced him. Says he, <HI>I have &s;inned again&s;t Heaven, and in thy Sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son:</HI> How is it that thou do&s;t ki&s;s me? O what &s;weet Expre&s;&s;ions, what &s;weet Fellow&s;hip is there between Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and a precious Soul, when Chri&s;t is vi&s;iting that Soul with his Love! He would have went on, and &s;aid, <HI>Make me as one of thy hired Servants</HI>; but the Father would not let him go on with his Confe&s;&s;ion, and therefore we are told,</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005089_0013_1016A2B36719CFB8">In the 22d. Ver&s;e. <HI>Then he &s;aid to his Servants,</HI> in the plural Number, not to one Servant, but to all of them, to &s;how the ha&s;te he was in to help his poor Son, make ha&s;te to welcome my dear Child home. <HI>The Father &s;aid to his Servants.</HI>&mdash;One would have thought he &s;hould have &s;aid, Go make this Prodigal be gone, no, but <HI>bring forth the be&s;t Robe, and put it on him, and put a Ring on his Hand and Shoes on his Feet.&mdash;Bring forth the be&s;t Robe.</HI>The Prodigal was willing to be like a hired Servant, any Thing would be good enough for him. No, he mu&s;t have a Robe, not only a Robe, but the be&s;t Robe, the Robe which his Father wore on high Days, the be&s;t Robe in all the Hou&s;e was not too good for him tho' &s;uch an un|grateful Child. The Father might have told him, &s;ee what thou ha&s;t lo&s;t by thy Prodigality; no, but &s;ays he, Fetch the be&s;t Robe: and it mu&s;t not only be fetcht out, but <HI>put upon him.</HI> Not only &s;o, but he mu&s;t <HI>put a Ring on his Hand,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h his Qua|lity. It appears he had no Shoes on his Feet, and the Father cannot bear that, then &s;ays he, <HI>Fetch out Shoes, and put them on his Feet,</HI>to &s;how how glad he was, and that nothing was too dear for him, &s;ays he, <HI>Bring hither the fatted Calf and kill it, and let us eat and be merry.</HI></P>
<P>But what are you to under&s;tand by this be&s;t Robe? It is the Robe of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, it is a Robe weaved by the Hand of Chri&s;t, a Robe that could not be purcha&s;ed without Chri&s;t &s;hed his precious Heart-Blood. If you &s;ee that you are naked, that you are undone, poor, mi&s;erable, blind, helple&s;s Sin|ners, God will put his Robe upon your naked Soul, God will apply Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s to your Heart, &s;o that you &s;hall be made to &s;ay, <HI>The Lord is my Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>

Did the Father put a <HI>Ring</HI> upon this young Man's Hand? So God &s;hall Seal you for his, by his Spirit, till the Day of Redemption; God &s;hall put his Spirit into your Heart, and by this &s;hall all Men know that you are God's Children, Sons and Daughters of the Lord Almighty. Did the Father put <HI>Shoes</HI> upon this young Man's Feet? So &s;hall your Feet be &s;hod with the Preparation of the Go&s;pel of Peace. Did the Father kill the <HI>fatted Calf?</HI> Did the Prodigal feed upon this fatted Calf? So &s;hall God feed your Soul with a hidden Life, a divine Life, a Joy that Strangers intermeddle not with. You &s;hall feel God in your Heart, you &s;hall feel Chri&s;t in your Soul. Did the <HI>Servants make merry?</HI> were they glad? So &s;hall God the Father communicate the News of your Conver&s;ion to the Angels above, and there will be Joy in Heaven over your repenting and coming to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. O methinks I &s;ee the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Spirits flying round the Congregation, tuning their Harps, and longing as the Hart panteth after the Water Brooks, to &s;ing an Anthem at your Conver&s;ion. Methinks I &s;ee them longing to a&s;cend the heavenly Ladder, and join the heavenly Quire, &s;aying, &s;ome precious Souls were dead, but God hath made them alive; they were lo&s;t to God, lo&s;t to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but God hath breathed into them the Breath of Life, and they are now become living Souls. O may God grant that this may be the Angels Song this Afternoon concerning &s;ome of you. I believe God intends to come among you this Day; I believe Je&s;us Chri&s;t intends to bring &s;ome of you home. O that there may be a whole Congregation coming together.

<P>One would have thought, all &s;hould have rejoyced at the Prodigal's coming home: But what can plea&s;e a &s;elf-righteous Per&s;on? God him&s;elf cannot plea&s;e him.

I &s;peak this by Experience. No one hath been a greater Sinner that Way, than that poor Creature that is now preaching the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to you. Many a precious Hour and Night have I &s;pent this Way, and thought it no Harm, as you may do: I went to the Sacrament, I kept Fa&s;ts before the Sacrament; I thought it no Harm to go to dancing for all that. But my dear Friends, take Warning, it hath co&s;t me many a Tear, many a gloomy Hour to reflect upon the many precious Hours I have &s;pent this Way, and I am amazed that God did not &s;end me to Hell. Take Warning by me, it co&s;t me many a bitter Hour, as it will co&s;t you if ever you come to God. You may put off Convictions now; but when Death takes hold of your Soul, you will &s;ee Things in another Light; you will be amazed to think that you &s;hould
