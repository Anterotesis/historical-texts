<P>T<HI>He Authors design was to reduce the whole of Mans Being, Business, and Blessedness, into as few lines as might be, thereby to invite a sober perusal of them; as also to let men see, That the</HI> Christian Reli|gion <HI>is Plain, its Precepts clear, and its Practise easie, to them on whom God hath wrought a saving Change, or true Conversion; which is the first thing treated of; the next is, to shew the Christian how to carry himself in Natural, Civil and Religious Duties. If thou readest it with a desire of spiritual ad|vantage (which was the end and prayer of the Author) God may bless it to thee; and both thou and the Author have cause (as for all his blessings) to praise him for this.</HI></P>

<HEAD>First, Of Preparation to Christianity.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. YOu must look upon true Chri|stianity to be of absolute ne|cessity, and an indispensable duty: you cannot live with|out it, and you dare not die without it. Wo to you, if you die before you live; if you die to the world, before you live to God; and if you go out of the World, before Je|sus Christ come into your heart: be sure that Christ be in you, so may he bring the hope of glory, <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 27. and that you be in Christ, so must be broke off from the wild olive of the old <HI>Adam,</HI> Rom. 11. 24. which two makes up the true Christian.</P>
<P N="2">2. You cannot attain to true Christiani|ty, until you be born again, [or from a|bove] <HI>Joh.</HI>3. 3,5. until you can experience
<PB N="2" REF="000358_0004_0FA554CF737B5DF8">
the death and burial of the old <HI>Adam,</HI> and the Resurrection of the New. You must be unmade to sin, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 24. and then made up again for God. 'Tis not scraping the walls of the house of the fretting Le|prosie, that will serve the turn, <HI>Lev,</HI> 14. 14, 44. but all the Timber, and all the Stones thereof must be thrown down to the ground that a new building may be ercted in its stead.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be sure, this can never be attained un|til you come to a sound and saving know|ledg, both of your self and Christ: (1) Of the emptiness and vileness of your self, so as to deny, abhor and abandon your self; and (2) Of Christs excellency and all-suf|ficiency, so as to value him your all, and above all; Indeed a full Christ and a vile nothing creature agrees best together.</P>
<P N="4">4. 'Twill be both your prudence and advantage to forbear the searching after the knowledg of other things, until you come to a solid knowledg of your self, which is the one thing needful in Christia|nity, and whereof Heathenism had some rude notion; to know your self to be lost
<PB N="3" REF="000358_0005_0FA554D06D68B9B0">
in your self, and never found again till you be [Found] in Christ, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.9.</P>
<P N="5">5. The more that you know your self, the greater will your self-abhorrency be, <HI>Job</HI> 42. 6. This will make you cry out with <HI>Augustine, [a malo homine</HI> [me ipso] <HI>libera me domine:</HI>] From that evil man (my self) Oh Lord, deliver me. You will find that though Satan be your great Enemy, yet your own sinful self is the worst: for Satan might strike fire long enough with|out success, if your own evil heart did not find him Tinder: the Tempter may be|siege the City long enough to no purpose, if there were not a treacherous party with|in, that lets down the Draw-bridge, and sets open the Gates to his Troops of Tem|ptations.</P>
<P N="6">6. This knowledg of your self will bring also greater dis-satisfaction with your pre|sent state and standing in wayes of unrege|neracy, with your being without God, &amp;- without Christ in the World; making you cry out not only Unclean, unclean; but also Undone, undone; give me Christ or I die, and that to all Eternity: I am condemned
<PB N="4" REF="000358_0006_0FA554D2B3A680F0">
already, <HI>John.</HI> 3. 18. and the wrath of God abides upon me, <HI>v.</HI> 36. Oh, who dares live in an House that is haunted with evil Spi|rits! or lodge in a Cave that abounds with noysome Toads and venemous Serpents! such and far worse is your lying in an un|renewed estate.</P>
<P N="7">7. When you behold the avenger of blood, to wit, Divine Justice pursuing you at the heels, his heart being hot within him, as <HI>Deut.</HI> 19. 6. then it is high time for you to hasten to that blessed City of Refuge the most excellent and all-sufficient Lord Jesus, who was purposely provided of the Father, to be a Saviour and Sanctuary to save us both from present wrath, and from wrath to come also, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 1.10. He is that Name of the Lord which the righteous run [into] and are safe, <HI>Prov.</HI> 18.10.</P>
<P N="8">8. In so doing, know for your incou|ragement, that the gates of the Sanctuary and City of Refuge shall not be shut against you. First, the place of Christs birth en|courages, which was an Inn: He was born in one <HI>of Bethlehem's</HI> Inns, a place that re|ceives all comers; all guests that come are bid welcome.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="000358_0007_0FA554D32FC83D20">
2. The posture of his death; Christ died upon the Cross with his Arms spread wide asunder, as in a posture ready to embrace all penitent sinners that come unto him, and fall into his arms. <HI>Him that cometh unto me, I will [in no wise] cast out, or keep out,</HI> Joh.6.37.</P>
<P N="9">9. And though you cannot run, or come fast enough to Christ, yet Christ will come and run to you, and meet you better half way. While the penitent Prodigal did but [come] towards his Father, his Father ran to meet him, <HI>and had compassion upon him, and fell on his neck and kissed him,</HI> Luk.15 20. Christ will be much better to you, than you will or can be to your self; <HI>for he [can] have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way,</HI> Heb. 5. 2. and though you cannot bring your self to grace, yet grace is [brought] to you by Christ.</P>

<HEAD>2. Of Carriage under the first workings of Christianity.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1: When the Lord Jesus comes and stands knocking at the door of your heart, with the hammer of his word, and with the hand of his Spirit, then bow your self with
<PB N="6" REF="000358_0008_0FA554D6940C2808">
all your might (as <HI>Samson</HI> did) <HI>Judg.</HI> 16. 30. to pull back every bolt, and to draw in every bar, that would keep the door shut against this blessed and bleeding Redeemer. The duty indeed is yours, but the ability is his: as much as in you lies, cause every lust of your heart to make room for your dear Jesus.</P>
<P N="2">2. Welcom Christ into your heart with joy. Say to him as <HI>Laban</HI> did to <HI>Abraham's</HI> Servant, <HI>Come in thou blessed of the Lord, [thou art welcome] wherefore standeth thou without?</HI> Gen.24.31. Christ will come to you with a blessing in his hand to bestow on you, as he did to <HI>Jacob.</HI> Gen. 32.26, <HI>&amp;c. David</HI> literal saith to his Son (that in|vited him to his house) <HI>Why should we be chargeable to thee, my Son?</HI> 2 Sam. 13. 25. But this <HI>David</HI> spiritual will not be char|geable: wheresoever he comes, where he comes to sup with any soul, he brings his supper with him, <HI>Rev.</HI>3.20. and eats but of his own honey-comb, and of his own ho|ney, <HI>Cant.</HI>5.1. This blessed Guest brings his blessing with him, as the Ark did to the house of <HI>Obed Edom.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. When Christ is come into your house
<PB N="7" REF="000358_0009_0FA554D815307428">
to dwell in your heart by faith, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 3. 17. be careful to keep his habitation quiet and comfortable; to this end you must adjure your corruptions <HI>by the roes and by the hinds of the field, that they stir not up nor awake your beloved until he please,</HI> Cant.2.7. 'Tis pity such a blessed Guest should meet with any disturbance; lay Gods charge upon your lusts, saying to them as <HI>Lot</HI> did to the <HI>Sodomites,</HI> Gen.19.8. <HI>Only unto this Angel of the Lord, and this Lord of Angels, do nothing [of disturbance] for therefore came he under the shadow of my roof:</HI> and as the good old man to the men of <HI>Gibeah,</HI> Judg,19.23. <HI>Nay, I pray you do not so wickedly, seeing this man</HI> (Christ Je|sus) <HI>is come into my house, do not this folly to disturb him.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Be oft admiring that blessed state of Grace which God hath brought you into, out of the cursed state of sin, and say with <HI>Peter</HI> at Christs transfiguration, <HI>Master, 'tis good being here; let us build Tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias;</HI> not one for himself, for he was so pleased with his present condition, that he could be content to lie out of doors, so he
<PB N="8" REF="000358_0010_0FA554DA8DC442F0">
might enjoy the vision of his Masters glo|ry, <HI>Mat:</HI>17:5:&amp;c: Say you with the <HI>He|brew</HI> Servant, <HI>I love my Master, he shall bore me through the ear, and I will stay with him for ever,</HI> Deut:15:16,17: and with <HI>Da|vid,</HI> you must resolve <HI>to dwell in the house of the Lord for ever,</HI> Psal:23:6: <HI>The purpose of your heart must be to cleave unto the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5: Be oft searching your heart in the sense, I: Of the state of sin, out of which (<HI>as</HI> Israel <HI>out of the house of bondage, and out of the Iron furnace,</HI> Deut:4:20:) your God, your near kinsman, the Lord Jesus hath deliver'd you. 2: Of the remainders of sin, from which you are not cleansed to this day, you cannot chide it out of doors as <HI>Sarah</HI> did <HI>Hagar;</HI> you cannot shake it from off your heart as <HI>Paul</HI> did the Viper from off his hand; 'tis as <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Beasts, <HI>whose dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a time and a season,</HI> Dan:7:12: this will ballast your new-found joy.</P>
<P N="6">6. Let your own self-righteousness stink and be abhorred by you, when the Righte|ousness of Christ is brought to clothe you: The father brings forth the best Robe for his ragged prodigal, <HI>Luk:</HI>15:22: When the
<PB N="9" REF="000358_0011_0FA554DAB5D02F20">
first <HI>Adam</HI> had made himself naked by his sin, he sowed fig-leaves together, and made himself an apron; this was both too thin and too scant a covering, <HI>but the Lord made a coat of skins</HI> (of the Sacrifices) <HI>and clothed them,</HI> Gen:3: 7, 21: alas your own righteousness is but a fig-leaf covering, no better than dogs-meat, or dung in <HI>Pauls</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Phil:</HI>3:8: in comparison of that coat made of the skin of the Lamb of God, which is call'd <HI>the righteousness of God,</HI> and therefore a better righteousness than that which <HI>A|dam</HI> had, or that which Angels have; a gar|ment or robe that covers the whole sinner from the angry eyes of offended Justice.</P>
<P N="7">7 Hunger after a tast and touch of Christ in the purest and powerfullest way of revealing himself to you in his ordinan|ces; set your self under no means of Grace, without begging of God to speak to your heart with a strong hand, as he did to the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> Isa: 8: 11: think it not e|nough that the Ministry (you sit under) is a <HI>lovely song</HI> to you, as <HI>Ezek:</HI>33:32: but it must be a <HI>lively</HI> song also, that you may say with <HI>David, Gods word hath quickened me, Psal.</HI>119:50:
<PB N="10" REF="000358_0012_0FA554DB9D07B3A0">
A divine touch in Gods Ordinances doth quicken us in Gods way, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119.37. You must know that Christ hath many fol|lowers, and but few touchers; when the multitude throng'd him, he had but one that touch'd him, so as to receive healing vertue from him, <HI>Mat</HI> 9.20. <HI>Luk.</HI>8.43&mdash;46.</P>
<P N="8">8. Get solid proof of your interest in Christ: build not upon sandy foundations, such as 1. On <HI>general mercy,</HI> as if he that made you, will undoubtedly save you: If so, then Devils would be saved as well as men, for God made both, and both are his creatures, 2. Nor <HI>on good meanings;</HI> if those would save you, then the Word of God, and the blood of Christ are two su|perfluous things. Nor 3. <HI>On an external Profession,</HI> for the house of the foolish buil|der was (for ought we know to the con|trary) as fair a Fabrick to look upon in externals, as that of the wise: and the main difference lay in the differing foundation, <HI>Mat.</HI>7.24.26. The Rock of ages (the Lord Jesus) was not the foundation of both, but loose earth, loose notions and principles, such as those beforementioned.</P>
<P N="9">9. Be not poring and puzling too long
<PB N="11" REF="000358_0013_0FA554DC31CFD0D8">
about laying your foundation; but having once laid Christ (alone) your foundation, go then on to build upon it, [<HI>strato super|struitur</HI>] God saith to the Children of <HI>Is|rael, they must go forward,</HI> Exod 14,15: you must neither stand still, nor step backward, <HI>Non progrediest regredi,</HI> not to go on is to go back: 'Tis undoubtedly one of the wiles of Satan, and his devices, (which we are not to be ignorant of) to gravel graci|ous spirits about that foundation-truth of their Election, to keep them from making passage and progress in ways of Christiani|ty; our Lord himself was thus buffeted, in Satan's saying to him, once and again [<HI>If thou be the Son of God.</HI>] If this were done to that green tree, what can the dry expect? Whereas, if you can make your calling sure (in the witnessings of the Ho|ly Ghost) you must take your Election for granted, seeing that Election-love is the cause and vocation-love the effect; now the effect is the manifestation of the cause; do but make your calling sure; and therein you make your election sure also, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10.</P>
<P N="10">10. Take heed you blot nor blur not your
<PB N="12" REF="000358_0014_0FA554DD20E737C0">
Evidences for Heaven by any loose and ex|travagant Actions; for suppose you can|not (if you be a true Christian) lose your Salvation, yet may you lose the joy of your Salvation, as <HI>David</HI> did, <HI>Psal:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">1:12: This indeed is the blessing of the Covenant of Grace, that though it doth permit a fall, yet alwayes ensures Repentance after the fall: notwithstanding, you may get such falls as may break your bones, and it may cost you both much pain, and much pains, before the Lord make you <HI>to hear of joy and gladness, that the bones which are broken</HI> (by your fall) <HI>may rejoyce,</HI> Psal;51:8:</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>3: Of the Exercise of spiritual Life.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1: Walk close with God in your general and particular calling, and be careful that the one do not justle out the other; as there is a time for all things, so there is a time for both those: your general calling must not thrust out your particular; that is but a temptation, and not a duty; neither must your particular calling thrust out your general, for that is to love the world more than God, and to serve your self altogether and not the Lord Christ at all. It was
<PB N="13" REF="000358_0015_0FA554DDB5949D20">
the sin of <HI>Cain,</HI> that he did not divide aright for God, the duties of your general calling (faithfully performed) must sancti|fie all the duties of your particular calling.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be oft at home communing with your own heart, <HI>Psal.</HI>4.4. and propoun|ding questions to it, such as these. 1. Whose am I? Am I one that belongs to God, or do I belong to Satan? 2. Whom serve I? do I serve Christ, or do I serve Sin? The blessed Apostle could answer both these questions, <HI>Act.</HI>27.23. <HI>There stood by me this night the Angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve.</HI> And 3. What am I? am I a ves|sel of wrath, or am I a vessel of mercy? am I a child of God, or am I a child of the devil? 4. Where am I? <HI>Adam where art thou?</HI> as God said so to <HI>Adam,</HI> so you must say to your own soul. Where art thou Soul? art thou in the broad way that leads to death and damnation, or art thou in the narrow way that leads to Salvation? &amp; if at any time you find your spirit loose &amp;c. extravagant in broad wayes of the World, then cry to your self, as God to <HI>Elijah, What dost thou here Elijah?</HI> 1 <HI>King.</HI>19.13. so gird up the loins of your mind again, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.35.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="14" REF="000358_0016_0FA554DE73E92F40">
3. Know that your heart will be back|ward to this communing work, <HI>Fugitivi sumus acordibus nostris,</HI> saith <HI>Augustine;</HI> we flee from our own hearts, and our own hearts flee as fast and as far from us. 'Tis pity we should carry hearts about with us in our bosoms for twenty, thirty, forty or fifty years, (some more if some less) and yet be such strangers to them, and they to us; account it therefore your great loss that you know your own heart no better, that you commune with it no oftener; alas, we know not our own hearts, <HI>Am I a Dog,</HI> (saith <HI>Hazael) that I should do so and so?</HI> 2 King. 8.13, Yet such a Dog was he in wickedness when he came to his opportu|nity; you must tremble to be left in the hands of your own counsel, as <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was left to himself, to try him (not the strength of his grace, as <HI>Abraham</HI> was, <HI>Gen.</HI> 22.1. but his frailty and proneness to sin) and to let him know all that was in his heart 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 32.31. When Satans Temptations hath an opportunity to draw out your cor|ruption, then and there is your most emi|nent danger.</P>
<P N="4">4. Seeing your heart will not stand to
<PB N="15" REF="000358_0017_0FA554E05FD4CDC0">
parley, do you bind it to good beheavour, and lay God's charge upon it that it stir not in this parleying work, till you have made some work of your work, &amp; brought it to some blessed issue; know, that never did the Sacrifice (under the Law) stand more in need of binding with cords to the horns of the Alter, than your loose and slippery heart doth with all obligations (and all little enough) unto holy duties; hence is it that self-examination is so hard a duty; no sooner are we in it, but ere ever we be aware, we are out of it a|gain.</P>
<P N="5">5. When ye have, through grace, fixed your heart, and are able to say with <HI>David, My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed, Psal.</HI> 57. 7: which undoubtedly is as hard to fix to good, as quick-silver is, that hath a principle of motion <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">n it, but not of rest, then fall upon Consideration-work, which is the excellency of a man above the beast; then consider, and better consider the four questions aforesaid and the tendency of all your wayes: <HI>Ponder the path of thy feet,</HI> Prov.4.26. to wit, by the weights of the Word of God, do you oft poize them;
<PB N="16" REF="000358_0018_0FA554E108826BC8">
Consideration is the stay of our thoughts, which are as swift as any Ship. Conside|ration is as an Anchor to them. God bids his People <HI>Consider their wayes,</HI> twice over, <HI>Hag.</HI> 1.5,7. do it once and again.</P>
<P N="6">6. You may know where you are, if you seriously and throughly consider the frame of your own spirit; the way to hell is a broad way; and he that is all for elbow room, and for a wide way to be extrava|gant in, and likes not the strict way of Re|ligion (which is so called from its strict binding up our hearts from loosness <HI>a reli|gando)</HI> is a broad-way man, that sayes with <HI>Jeroboam, 'Tis too much for you to go up to Jerusalem,</HI> 1 King.12. 28. 'Tis too much for you to be so much precise, and so strait laced; <HI>Let us break those bands asunder, and cast away those cords from us,</HI> Psal. 2. 3 <HI>Medice vivere, est misere vivere,</HI> to live strictly by a Rule, is to live miserably, both for soul and body. <HI>Spiritus Religiosus est spiritus melancholicus; Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall dy, Isa.</HI>22. 12, 14, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 32.</P>
<P N="7">7. You have this exemplified in <HI>Noah'</HI>s Raven and Dove, <HI>Gen</HI> 8: 7,9, 11: You may
<PB N="17" REF="000358_0019_0FA554E1AF73BC50">
not be as the Raven that was accustom'd to live at large, becomes weary of being ca|ged up in the Ark, and likes not such strait limits any longer, therefore she flut|ters about the Ark, but went not in, as not willing to be confined to the Ark either for diet or lodging any more, but chuses rather to fly abroad, and feed upon the car|cases of the drowned.</P>
<P N="8">8. You must be like the Dove which did not dislike her confinement, nor the diet and lodging of the Ark, and therefore re|turns to it as the place of her rest, and best repose, not finding better repast any where else. Thus those are unclean Ravens, that are all for fleshly liberty and licentiousness, and can feed upon stinking carrion of wic|kedness; but you must be Christ's Dove, <HI>Cant:</HI> 2:14: that can find no rest for the soles of your feet but in him; you must (with others) flock to the Temple, <HI>Isa:</HI> 60. 8, Christ your <HI>Noah,</HI> your Comforter, will put forth his hand to take you in; and there think his service your wages, as well as your work, and not your weariness.</P>
<P N="9">9: Thus must you be serious in inquiring of your self, whose you are, and whom you
<PB N="18" REF="000358_0020_0FA554E239AD78F0">
serve; Yea, and what you are, as well as where? whether in the broad or narrow way: If consideration be needful in all our undertakings, how much more in that for Eternity! Oh, be not slight herein, but dwell with your thoughts upon it. You know, he that rides post through a Coun|trie, can never draw a distinct Map of that Countrie, which requires many pauses for viewing every particular boundary, <HI>&amp;c:</HI> So if you ride post with your swift thoughts in your circuit thorough the Isle of Man, you cannot take a distinct account of your self in order to those four grand Questi|ons: You must walk round about your self, and go round that little world, as they did about Sion, <HI>Psal.</HI> 48. 12,13. <HI>That they might tell the towers thereof, and mark well her bulwarks; yea, and [consider] her Pa|laces,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="10">10. Then hath your spiritual considera|on, a blessed issue, when you dwell upon it with your fixed thoughts, untill Christ appear your chiefest good, and sin your chiefest evil: <HI>David</HI> did <HI>turn [his] wayes upside down,</HI> as the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word [<HI>chisha|bli daraki</HI>] signifies, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119. 59. <HI>In his

<P N="3">3 Be careful that the World out-strip you not in any moral action; you may not do less than others, when your Lord com|mands <HI>you to do more than others,</HI> Mat:5:47: as Christ hath done singular things for you (in shewing you singular grace and mer|cy) so he both expects and requires singu|lar things from you; you must be emi|nent in good works, <HI>Tit:</HI> 2:14: and get a|bove others, having your feet where other mens heads are; <HI>The way of the righteous is above to the wise,</HI> Prov: 15:24: He goes an higher way to work than the ordinary frame of the world; he knows, that more than the common stint is required of him, he must do that which the world will never do, and that is, he must walk accurately, endeavouring to get up to the very top of godliness, as the word in the original signi|fies, <HI>Eph:</HI>5:15:</P>

<P N="7">7: Be not too talkative amongst those where providence casts you. Consider God hath given you two ears, and but one tongue; Yea, and that shut up with a double door, the one of flesh, and the o|ther of bone, to wit, your lips and your teeth; this should teach you to speak spa|ringly, and to hear twice as much as you

<P>2: Your Conversation to those that are within.</P>
<P N="1">1: As you may not be blind in charity, so neither must you be rash in censure; 'tis better to be over credulous, than over suspitious, and over censorious. God puts a charitable construction upon the case of the betrothed Damosel, <HI>Deut:</HI> 22:27: As there was none to save her, so there was none to hear her; yet 'tis taken for grant|ed there, that in such a case, she cried out, therefore she shall not die: This shews us that alwaies in doubtful cases, we should put on the best construction:</P>
<P N="2">2: Be sure you see Grace where Sin is, as well as Sin where Grace is: keep warm your love to those that truly fear God, be|cause of those graces that shine forth in them; and take heed of lessening your love
<PB N="26" REF="000358_0028_0FA554EDD7308218">
to them, because of those infirmities that do attend them; 'tis pitty the worst part should be seen, and the best part either not seen, or (at least) not acknowledged; the Lord, himself, would not <HI>see iniqnity in</HI> Ja|cob, <HI>nor sorcery in</HI> Israel, <HI>Num.</HI>23: 21. When there was [<HI>non peccatum flammans</HI>] no flam|ing sin at that time among them in his eye and therefore <HI>Balaam</HI> councelled their ene|mies to entice them to Fornication, which would be a flaming God-provoking Sin; enormities indeed cannot, but infirmities may and ought to be covered with a Man|tle of Love; God is a good Copy to write after.</P>
<P N="3">3. Take heed of imitating of the great|est favourite of heaven in any of his failings; you are compassed about with a great cloud of Witnesses in the sacred Scriptures, <HI>He.</HI>12:1: Yet know that this cloud, like that cloud in the Wilderness, hath a black side as well as a bright; to wit, their infirmities are recorded, as well as their graces; you may not imitate <HI>Joseph</HI> in his swearing, but you must in his chastity; you may not fol|low <HI>Job</HI> in his passion and impatiency, but you must in his patience and piety; and so
<PB N="27" REF="000358_0029_0FA554EEB2805840">
of the rest. The frailties of those eminent Saints are registred in Holy Writ, just as dangerous Rocks are marked out at Sea, not to run upon them, but to shun them: they are penned down as examples of cau|tion, but not of imitation. You must know, that they which followed the dark side of the Cloud (in the Red-sea) were <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and were drowned; but they that followed the bright side of it, were <HI>Israelites,</HI> and passed safe, not only over the Red-sea, but into <HI>Canaan.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Have not the Faith of Christ with respect of persons, but be careful to love Grace in rags, as well as in robes: Grace may, indeed, commend Gold, but Gold can never commend Grace; the lesser must be the blest of the greater: Tis true, that Gold may beautifie the Temple, but 'tis still the Temple that sanctifies the Gold. Persons, though never so rich, or never so richly array'd, are at the best but silken dust, and they may be no better than golden damnation.</P>
<P>The second part of your Conversation is that which respects your self, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be not quick sighted abroad, &amp; blind at home; this is to be a <HI>Benzoma,</HI> as the
<PB N="28" REF="000358_0030_0FA554EF0772FF68">
<HI>Hebrews</HI> phraise it, to be extravagant, or seldom at home (as the Harlot, <HI>Pro:</HI>7:11:) seldom communing with your own heart; you must hate Sin in others, but especially in your self; know that your heart is full of Harlotry; and if you seek your self too much abroad, you will (at last) find your self but lost at home; but if you be much at home, as indeed the greatest part of the work of a Christian lies within doors, then Sin will not dare to haunt your house or heart; or however neither sins little or great can then live peaceably with|in you.</P>
<P N="2">2: Be sure you give not place to little sins, for they will wear away the tenderness of your Conscience, and like little thieves, (creeping in at the window) they will open the door for great ones; little wedges do make way for the greater, and so your soul may be cloven asunder thereby: Eve|ry Sin, be it small or great, should be a stranger to you, and not an home-dweller in you. Thus <HI>David'</HI>s Sin was but a tra|veller, that came only to visit him, but not to take up any continuing lodgings within him. Thus 'tis said in <HI>Nathan'</HI>s Pa|rable,
<PB N="29" REF="000358_0031_0FA554EFC40D4310">
<HI>There came a Traveller unto the rich man,</HI> 2 Sam.12.4. It is Christ (and not sin) that must lie all night between the Spouses breasts, <HI>Cant.</HI>1.13. she will have no home-dweller but Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3. Live not at random, but square your life by the rule of Righteousness, <HI>to wit,</HI> the Word of God, in thought, Word and Deed; and account every transgression of that rule to be your sin; at night call your faithless heart to a faithful account how oft and how much you have come short of that rule the day past; a sensible frame of spi|rit will easily find out, that Gods Com|mandments are exceeding broad, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119. 96. but your obedience is exceeding nar|row; and that your sins are more in num|ber than the hairs upon your head, <HI>Psal.</HI> 40.12. so innumerable, that you cannot rec|kon them, (<HI>who can tell the errors of his life?</HI> Psal.19.12) and if you cannot reckon them sure I am, you can never be able to reckon for them, that must be the work of your blessed Surety, our dear Lord Jesus.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let not any one transgression of that divine Rule, live peaceably in you, not so much as a vain thought must take up lodg|ings
<PB N="30" REF="000358_0032_0FA554F08DDB8BE0">
in your heart, <HI>Jer.</HI>4.14. as water that is sprung into a Ship, is presently pumpt out again in leaky Vessels, for fear of sink|ing; So when any soul-sinking sin springs in upon you (which certainly will come faster in than water into a vessel at Sea) then be sure you ply the Pump of Prayer and Repentance, and never give over pump|ing, till your Vessel be cleansed, and till you have some sense that your sin is par|doned; you will not go to bed with a bone out of joynt, but it must be set right with expedition; 'tis pity that the soul (disjoynted with sin) should be so long neglected.</P>
<P N="5">5. 'Tis a blessed frame of spirit to nou|rish in you both the sense of your own sin, and the fear of Gods wrath for your sin: the heavier that your sins are to you, the lighter will your afflictions be on you; 'tis wind and rain coming both together, that makes the storm in our souls; when your sin is your burden, 'tis then repented of, and so pardoned; this will make your affliction a far lighter burden.</P>
<P N="6">6. Take heed of putting holiness upon you as a loose Garment, to cast off or on
<PB N="31" REF="000358_0033_0FA554F15C263510">
at pleasure (according to your differing companies and occasions:) but be sure that you gird it close to you with the gol|den girdle of truth, <HI>Ephes.</HI>6.14. that in all places you may be what you seem to be; that you be to God, what you seem to be to man; &amp;c. that you be to God at all times&punc; what you seem to be to man at any time.</P>
<P N="7">7. Take heed of grieving the good Spi|rit of God, <HI>wherewith you are sealed to the day of Redemption,</HI> Eph.4.30. and <HI>which is a delicat a thing,</HI> as some read <HI>Psal.</HI>143. 10. <HI>res delicata est spiritus tuus;</HI> and therefore loves to live in a clean house, in a clean heart. 'Tis a foul fault to grieve an earth|ly Father; but 'tis far greater to grieve this holy spirit: If you grieve the Holy Ghost, how can you expect that he should comfort you? when you are grieved, you cannot do your work as you are wont, and neither can the holy Spirit do his work in and for you: a Guest that is grieved, may leave the house that grieves him; so this delicate thing (the Spirit of God) may leave your house desolate, when grieved with your sins, <HI>Mat.</HI>23:38. and then wo to you if God and his good spirit depart from you, <HI>Hos.</HI>9.12.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="32" REF="000358_0034_0FA554F1EF30A488">
8. But above all, <HI>take heed of quenching the Spirit,</HI> 1 Thess.5.19. <HI>to wit,</HI> in his mo|tions and graces: If God have kindled from heaven the holy fire upon the altar of your heart, be careful that it be kept burning there continually (in your love to Christ, and zeal for him) it must never go out, <HI>Lev.</HI>6:12,13. You must stir up this fire (as the Apostle counselleth, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI>1.6. and not despise Prophecying; for the Priests lips blows it up into a flame, it may be quenched either by withdrawing of fuel <HI>to wit,</HI> neglect of Ordinances; or by cast|ing on water, <HI>to wit,</HI> by falling into foul courses: you must beware of both.</P>
<P N="9">9: Be not ashamed to become a <HI>fool for Christ,</HI> 1 Cor.3.18. Self conceit, self-will and self-love, (like <HI>Noahs</HI> three Sons) hath spread themselves over the whole world; you must deny your own self-conceit and carnal wisdom: you must account your self more bruitish than any man, (with <HI>A|gur,</HI> Prov:20.2,3.) when you come to <HI>Ithi|el</HI> and <HI>Vcal</HI> (which is Christ, both good|ness and power) to be instructed in Christs School, <HI>Act.</HI>4:13.

<P N="11">11 You must chuse any suffering rather than the least sinning; you must not chuse iniquity rather than affliction, <HI>Job</HI> 36:21: for there is more evil in the least sin than in the greatest sufferings, in as much as Moral Evil is far worse and greater than that which is meerly natural: <HI>Quas

The ancient Martyrs would not accept of deliverance upon ig|noble and sinful terms, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 35. They would not throw so much as one grain of frankincense to the Idol, though it would have saved their own lives; hence <HI>Daniel</HI> chose rather to be cast to the Lions, than to violate his Conscience, and so to have a Lion roaring in his bosom; he knew that in an angry Conscience he might feel the unbearable stroaks of an angry God; and a man had better anger all the Witches in the world; yea, and all the Devils in hell, than anger God.</P>

And <HI>Austin</HI> saith, that a man ought not to tell a lie, though he might save the whole world from hell thereby; for there is more evil in one lie, than there is good (saith he) in the salvation of all the World: and he would chuse Hell rather than Sin, if set before him for choice. Thus the pri|mitive Christians cried [<HI>Ad leones potius quam ad Lenones</HI>] Throw us to your Lions, rather than to your Harlotry; though this would save our lives, yet would it destroy our souls.

<HEAD>The second Natural Action is Rest or Re|creation.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. You may look upon Rest and Recrea|tion as lawful upon a twofold account: 1: Rest from Labour, and refreshing the Bo|dy and Mind, are necessary, because Man's nature is like the Bow, which being always bent, is easily broken: Therefore did the Lord appoint the Night to succeed the Day, and the Sabbath to succeed the Week, as fit seasons for Man to rest from his labours in; now that which is necessary is also lawful (for God never necessitates a Man to sin against him; and if Rest be lawful, then is some Recreation (which is cal'd so, as a second Creation) in due time and place; there must be <HI>Otium</HI> as well as <HI>Ne|gotium.</HI> The second account is, your Chri|stian

actions that be of themselves and in their own nature lawful, yet throw your corrup|tion they are capable af excess and inordi|nateness: The sly and subtile insinuations of Satan (under a pretence of your own Christian liberty in going as far as you may) will carry you somtimes a little further than you should. Excessive, and immode|rate, and inordinate delight is sinful, al|though it be in objects that are not sinful in themselves. This in the general con|cerning all those actions.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>ly.</HI> In particular 1. Of Labour.</P>
<P N="1">1. Touching the Natural Actions in particular; as first of labour, whether it be done in the sweat of the brow, or of the brain, (indeed a Ministers labour con|sists of both) you must (at least) own one of those; God made the <HI>Leviathan</HI> to sport in the Sea; but never any man to sport on the earth: every man must go forth to some work or other till the evening, <HI>Psal.</HI> 104.23,26. there must be either manual or mental labour.</P>
<P N="2">2 Take those few Directions to managa your heart in your honest employment and labour. <HI>Dir:</HI> 1: Beg of God for ability of body in your labour: 'twas part of the Ser|pents

Oh! bless God for it, especially if you be strong to la|bour: If it be a priviledge in Oxen, <HI>Psal.</HI> 144. 24. Much more in men.</P>
<P><HI>Direct.</HI> 2. Pray that your mind may be suitable to your labour as well as your bo|dy; when there is unsuitableness 'twixt the mind of man and his employment, then the work never comes kindly off, nor goes it comfortably end-wayes; either your cha|riot wheels are taken off, and then you drive heavily; or they want Unction, and then they make a creaking repining noise, much unlike the chariots of <HI>Aminadab,</HI> or of a willing People, as the word signifies.

You may be Righteous over much in denying your self such a free use of the Creature (yea, and condemning it too) which you are allowed to have by the purchase and promise of Christ. Thus <HI>Isaac</HI> (who was the most loving Husband in holy Writ, for 'tis said of him, and of none else, that he loved his Wife, <HI>Gen.</HI>24:67:) <HI>Sported with</HI> Rebeccah <HI>his Wife,</HI> Gen. 26. 8: And the <HI>Jew</HI> was commanded to cheer up the heart of his Wife the first year, <HI>Deut:</HI> 24: 5, And <HI>Solomon</HI> bids the Husband <HI>be alwayes ravished with her beauty,</HI> Prov:5:18, 19: Thus <HI>Ezekiels</HI> Wife was call'd <HI>the desire of his eyes,</HI> Ezek: 24: 16: Assuredly men ought to take singular Complacency in their Wives company, and yet without all uxoriousness: None questions Parents dandling their Children upon their knees, as old <HI>Joseph</HI> did his Grand-children, <HI>Gen.</HI> 50: 23: <HI>Isa:</HI> 66 12.</P>

Di|rections for managing your heart aright in your Rest or Recreations.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Direct.</HI> You must take heed of wast|ing too much precious time therein: In|deed we do not so much want time, as wast time; a vain expence of that time, (which either your general calling re|quires in holy duties, or your particular calling calls upon you for in necessary em|ployments) is not only unlawful, but a|bominable? you are commanded to redeem time, <HI>Eph.</HI>5.16. but never to pass time: the loss of time is such a precious thing that God commands satisfaction for it, <HI>Exod.</HI> 10.19. It will be but a poor reckoning at your Lords returning, in your accompt for expence of your talent of time; <HI>Item,</HI> spent so many dayes or hours in Recrea|tion: Oh what would the damned in Hell give for but one of those hours which we have wilfully wasted! Time is like the Urchion or Hedg-hog that must not be handled by the head, but by the heels, in its going from you; take time while time serves.</P>

<PB N="48" REF="000358_0048_0FA5550A4168AC08">
compared to honey, it must be taken up|on the tip of the finger only, and not whole handfuls of it, for fear of surfeiting: <HI>Omne nimium vertitur in vitium;</HI> alas mans weak heart is soon overcharged, <HI>Luk.</HI> 21.34. and soon grows frothy, foolish, if not sensual and sinful in it; you must know, that the holy end of Recreation is to fit you the more for the duties of your general and particular calling (in case of weari|ness of body, or tiredness of mind) but if it indispose you to either or both, your heart doth deceive you; such as spend their lives in sports, and their livelyhood too, will prove but bad accomptants, when they bring in the broken Accounts of their Ste|wardship to their Lord and Master at the last day.</P>

<P N="5">5. <HI>Dir.</HI> The fifth Direction: notwith|standing all, yet must you account it safer not to trust your heart with any Recrea|tion at all, any further than is plainly ne|cessary: get (therefore) up your heart to live without them, and take up your whole delight in God, <HI>Psal:</HI> 37:4.

<HEAD>The third natural Action is feeding your belly</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The 3<HI>d.</HI> Natural Action is feeding your belly, which is daily work, for our tottering tabernacles of clay stand in need to be supported with the staff of daily bread, and therefore is our life call'd <HI>the life of our hands,</HI> Isa. 57.10: as our hands are daily

<P N="1">1 <HI>Dir.</HI> Hence your first Direction is, Be sure you eat and drink with an aim at the Glory of God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI>10.31.

<PB N="52" REF="000358_0052_0FA5550D147332F0">
Oh could you but eat to his glory, &amp; drink to his glory, you would not so easily fin in them.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Dir. T</HI>he second Direction: Feed your self with a God-blessing heart, which is the true spiritual heave-offering, <HI>Numb.</HI>15.19. When your heart is heaved or lifted up to God, and in every thing gives thanks saying, Oh what charges do you put God to, in consuming his Corn and his Cattle, <HI>Hos.</HI>2.8,9.

Yet what an unprofitable servant are you, and what an undutiful Son? even such as God complains of <HI>Isai.</HI> 1.2. <HI>I have nourish|ed and brought up children, and they have re|belled against me.</HI> You must admire and adore God that is so good, and does so good to you, who are so evil, and do so e|vil to him; cry, <HI>I am less than the least of all thy mercies,</HI> Gen.32.10. Have high thoughts of God, and low of your self; the same <HI>Jacob</HI> that had pleaded his merit with <HI>La|ban,</HI> Gen:31:38&mdash;41. yet here sets a low rate on himself to God.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>Dir.</HI> The third Direction: whatever sweetness you find in any creature (you

<P N="4">4<HI>Dir.</HI> The fourth Direction: You may not feed your self without fear, as those in <HI>Jud.</HI>12, 1. But first, sanctifie it by Prayer, 1 <HI>Tim:</HI>4:4,5.

not only with his leave, but also with his love; not only from his hand, but also from his heart; not only out of the Court of Christs general providence, but also out of the Court of special favour. 2. Feed soberly: Sobriety will reclaim you from be|ing either unseasonable in time, or unrea|sonable either in matter or measure, either in quantity or quality: 1. Not unseason|able as to time, <HI>Eccl.</HI>10,16. not as luxurious persons, that serve their bellies in the morn|ing (that golden hour for Prayer) before they serve their God; nor as those in <HI>Amos</HI> 6.4.6. that Feasted riotously, without lay|ing to heart the afflictions of <HI>Joseph;</HI> while <HI>Joseph</HI> was in the Pit; alas, his Brethren pitied him not, <HI>Gen:</HI> 32:23: 2. Neither must it be unreasonable either for matter or mea|sure; 1. Not for matter or quality, as the rich Glutton, <HI>that fared deliciously every day,</HI> Luk:16:19: as Purple and Silk was his daily clothing, so costly delicacies was his daily Food; but (alas) it was all his Heaven he had, as <HI>Abraham</HI> told him when he was in Hell.

<P>The fourth natural action is clothing your body, wherein the pride of your heart may deceive you, <HI>Obad.</HI> 3. Therefore take these Directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first Direction: Ponder the O|riginal of your clothing; it was not in the state of innocency, for then was there nei|ther parching heat, nor pinching cold; and nakedness was then no shame but a glorious comeliness; shame is the daughter of sin, which brought in the first clothing as well as distemperature of air (in heat and cold) the fruits of the fall: Remem|ber that nakedness of the soul brought in the first clothing for the body; so that 'tis but the badge of man's shame, and the to|ken of his rebellion against his Maker; it carries along with it a secret confession of his own guilt. You may not then be proud of your Apparel, for that is to be
<PB N="57" REF="000358_0057_0FA555111C2093A8">
proud of your own shame; no man is proud of a plaister on his sore, for that de|monstrates there is a wound; no Thief is proud of his Fetters, for they declare he he hath offended the law, and that heinous|ly; neither must you be of your garments, which are the cover of your shame, and the sign of your sin.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second Direction: Take notice that all your clothing are but borrowed things; how do you borrow the skin, hair &amp; wool of bruit beasts, to cover your naked|ness withal, and what are your silks, but the spittle and excrements of a poor worm? All (as it were) the very cast-apparel of unreasonable creatures: Man lives on bor|rowing, and that from things that are worse than himself in respect of their na|ture. Therefore you may not be proud of these things that you borrow; no creature so begarly, so needy as man is, in point of clothing; for every creature brings its clothing into the world with it, but you were born a naked creature, and must bor|row all to cover you, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.4,6: And will you be proud (as the Crow in the Fa|ble) of your borrowed Feathers? you may
<PB N="58" REF="000358_0058_0FA555137A39A3C0">
well know, that your God doth not cover you for any such end.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third Direction: Instead of proud reflections on your self, use holy So|liloquies with your self; saying; 1 I have a naked Soul to cover (as well as a naked body) and therefore must look out for the wedding garment, <HI>to wit,</HI> the righteousness of Christ (both imparted and imputed) I must put on the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13,14. that I may not be found naked, <HI>Rev.</HI> 16.15. but that I may be comely to God as well as to man. 2. The putting off your clothing at night, should mind you of putting off the old man, <HI>&amp;c. Eph.</HI>4.22. and of putting off your Tabernacle of corrup|tion, 2 <HI>Pet:</HI> 1:14. 2 <HI>Cor:</HI>5:2,3,4. and then must you go down to the bed of the grave, there to sleep till the morning of the Re|surrection. 3. When you put on your clothing again in the morning, it should mind you, that you must be raised out of the bed of the grave, and then <HI>corruption shall put on incorruption, and mortality shall be swallowed up of life,</HI> 1 Cor.15.53. 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 5.4. if you have put on the new man, the image of God in Christ.</P>

<P N="6">6. When you view the changeableness of the face of Heaven, and its outward appearance unto you; this may teach you in the third place, that as the Heaven is sometimes bright, and sometimes clouded, not all night, nor all day; the Sun some|times over-cast with a black cloud, and sometimes breaking out in its splendor and glory; and as the Moon hath her changes and her borrowed light, ruling the night, as the Sun the day, so you may not expect any fixed constancy in any condition upon earth, while there is such changeableness in the face of heaven.</P>
<P N="7">7. When you consider 4. the firmness of the body of heaven, how it hath conti|nued firm and unworn (notwithstanding its motion (which wears all other things) is with incredible swiftness) from the crea|tion

of the World, then did the Lord spread out that heaven like a curtain, and it hath continued spread for almost six thousand years, yet not one hole can be discerned in that curtain to this day: Oh how may this teach you the unchangeableness of God who was the Creator and is the upholder of Heaven, and what a safe place heaven is, to lay up your treasure in, so far cut of the reach of all rust and robbery.</P>
<P>The second leaf in the book of nature is,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Earth, which the heaven oft hear<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, and waters with showers of blessings; some|times God stops up close bottles of heaven, and sometimes he opens them. <HI>Speak to the Earth and it shall teach you,</HI> Job 12. 8. How the clouds are Gods watering pot, and his spunges which he squeezes with a gentle hand, that the rain may softly descend and drop fatness upon the furrows of the earth. Consider, Oh what dependency hath man upon God! the Rain hath no farther but God; the vanities of the Gentiles cannot give rain, <HI>Jer.</HI>14.22.</P>
<P N="2">2. Meditate how the air blows upon the earth, yet is invisible; and although it be so; yet is it the preserver of your life, which
<PB N="66" REF="000358_0065_0FA5551EF46B3C38">
is nothing but a vapour, and a little warm breath turned up and down the nostrils: how may this put you in mind of the in|visible God, who filleth all things; and in whom you live, move, &amp; have your being?</P>
<P N="3">3. When you consider how the Earth hangeth in the midst of the air (poized equally every way) and yet not reeled out of its place this five thousand years and up|ward, notwithstanding the hidious Tem|pests that hath been upon it, and the dread|ful Earth-quakes that hath been within it, <HI>Psal.</HI>104 56. <HI>God laid the foundation of the Earth, that it cannot be removed for ever.</HI> And <HI>he hangeth the earth upon nothing,</HI> Job 26.7. Now if the whole massy body of the earth hang so steadily and stedfastly upon the powerful precept of God; O then be|think your self, how firmly you ought to hang upon the precious promise of God, both for your safety in this World, and for your salvation in the World to come.</P>
<P N="4">4 Behold the fruits of the Earth, and con|sider, that a woman when about fifty years of age is past child-bearing; yet this great Mother (the Earth) though she be above five thousand years old, is not past fruit-bearing still; and whence comes it but from

<P N="5">5. Your beholding of the Grass of the field (while you are walking to meditate there as <HI>Isaac</HI> did, <HI>Gen.</HI>24.63.) may mind you of your mortality, and of your wither|ing condition; <HI>All flesh is grass, Isai.</HI> 42.6,7. that grass which the sythe cuts not down in Summer while 'tis young and juicy, the sharp frosts of an hard winter will wither away; so though you escape the sy the of death in the summer of your youth (while your bones are full of marrow, and your veins of blood) yet the winter of old age will wither you.</P>

6: When you behold that variety of tree it may teach you the difference among men; some are wild trees, trees of the wood (that is out of the Church) whose fruit be crabs &amp; acorns, mask for hogs, not meat and me|dicine for men, as <HI>Ezek:</HI>47:12: Others are trees of Righteousness, planted and wa|tered by the Lord, <HI>Isa.</HI>61.3.

<P N="1">1. The third leaf in the book of Nature is the Sea, the great and wide Ocean, which yet is but as a babe in the hands of the great God, and as a little infant in swad|ling bands, <HI>Job</HI> 36:9: If you or any that are near and dear to you be concern'd at Sea, Oh, how may this consideration com|fort you, that your God can as easily rule and repress the unruly Ocean, as the Mo|ther doth her tender suckling, when it is swadled up by her hands; 'tis the work of the Almighty to set bounds to that raging Element, <HI>Job</HI> 38:9,10:</P>

<P N="1">1. Thus far of occasional Meditation upon the book of nature; there is also Me|ditation appointed upon the book of Scrip|ture, which you must be acquainted with, as far exceeding the other; for the book of nature, though never so diligently read over, yet will it not bring you to the sa|ving knowledg of God in Christ, nor throughly furnish you for every good work but the book of Scripture is a larger field, furnished with all sorts of spiritual and fragrant flowers, whereupon you may free|ly feed your best thoughts without ever nauseating. If you can but unclasp the ta|bles of your own heart (when you unclasp your Bible) a praying heart can never want a profitable subject; Oh let it not please you that carnal hearts can think of things be|low, not only an hour, a day, a week, a moneth, but even a whole year without weariness, and that to think on Gods name <HI>Mal.</HI>3.17. should weary you so soon. 2. This se|cond sort of meditation is a set &amp; solemn acting
<PB N="72" REF="000358_0071_0FA555237423D6E0">
of the soul upon some chosen subject, till you can extract some sweet and soul-ravi|shing thoughts out of your own heart there|by; your subject or matter of meditation must be some scriptural truths, such as are summarily comprehended in <HI>Phil.</HI>4.8.(that little Bible) <HI>Whatsoever things are true, what|soever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any vertue, if there be any praise, think on these things.</HI> In that one <HI>Verse</HI> is contained the whole duty of Man, the good and the All of man, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12.13. <HI>Mic.</HI> 6.8.</P>
<P>The second Religious Action is Prayer, which well follows Meditation; for as: 1. Meditation is a blessed beginning to pray|er, so prayer is a blessed conclusion of me|ditation, &amp; therefore is the double reading of <HI>Gen.</HI> 24: 63: <HI>Isaac</HI> went out to meditate, or he went out to pray. So then when your heart is weell warmed with the An|gelical duty of Meditation, then fall upon the Evangelical duty of Prayer, then tender and render your homage to the God of all
<PB N="73" REF="000358_0072_0FA55526767D18C0">
your mercies, crying with <HI>David, Oh the God of my mercies,</HI> Psal.59.10.</P>
<P N="2">2. You must know, that Prayer is the pouring out of the heart to God, <HI>Psal.</HI> 62.8. 'Tis not the pouring out of your speech but of your spirit unto the Lord. God looks not so much at what you do, as with what spirit you do for him; you must serve God with your spirit in the Gospel of his Son, <HI>Rom</HI> 1.9. not resting in a bare gift of Prayer, without the grace of Prayer, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.10. you may not fetch materials or a|bilities for this work from your self, but you must pray in the Holy Ghost, <HI>Jude.</HI> v.20. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.26: The lifting up of your own tools upon Gods Altar, will not polish, but pollute it, <HI>Exod:</HI> 20: <HI>ult.</HI> That earnestness in prayer which flows meerly from a na|tural spirit, is but the cry of the creature and not the groans of that holy spirit which helps our infirmities; but expressions with|out impressions.</P>
<P N="3">3. You must pray that God may rebuke Satan that resists you in prayer; watch the adversary that watches you, and watch your own heart likewise, which will not only hang off from this work, but will also
<PB N="74" REF="000358_0073_0FA5552682D97630">
conspire with Satan to give you disturbance when you are breathing out your desires into your Father<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> bosom, and send by this winged Messenger to him you will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it hard to serve the Lord (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> this duty) without distraction, as 1 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> No ene|my like one treacherous within.</P>
<P N="4">4. Take heed of formality in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> duty; as a Musicians finger will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> a song as he hath often played, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his mind all the while be employed about out o|ther things; so many run over such a pray|er as they have often used, yet their hearts are roving (all the time) about other things. God requires the strength of your affections in his service; every offering must be made by fire, if of a sweet savour to the Lord, <HI>Lev.</HI> 1.9.13,17. yea your self, as well as your sacrifice, must be falted with fire, <HI>Mark</HI> 6. 49. <HI>David</HI> prayed and cried with his whole heart, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119,58,145. <HI>Samson</HI> bows himself with all his might at the Pillars of <HI>Dagons</HI> Temple, <HI>Judg.</HI>16.30. and have not you the strong|holds of sin in you to be pull'd down by Prayer. You must go to prayer as the Sun in its strength, <HI>Judg.</HI> 5.31. and come to God as a
<PB N="75" REF="000358_0074_0FA55528A97C6450">
Prince, <HI>Job</HI> 31.37. the Sun in his might doth disperse clouds that would darken it; and a princely spirit to wrestle with God, as <HI>Jacob</HI> hath power with God, and prevai|leth for the blessing: to put off God with cold formal devotion, is the epidemical disease of all Christendom.</P>
<P N="5">5. Be not regardless about the returns of your prayers, nor careless of the events and issue of them; be not like those Archers that shoot not at a mark, but at rovers, at random, never ob|serving where their arrows fall. Spiritual pray|ers are the arrows of Gods deliverance, 2 <HI>King</HI> 13. 16,17. Prayer is like the Bow of <HI>Jonathan,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI>1.22. It never returns empty. If you dare be careless in asking, how can you wonder that God is careless in answering?</P>
<P N="6">6. Be clothed with Humility while you are in prayer to God: He that resists the proud, gives grace to the humble. In order hereto, get the Majesty of the great God (with whom you have to do therein) wrought kindly upon your heart, till you know (aright) your distance, not only your natural distance 'twixt God and you, as you are a creature; but especially your mortal distance 'twixt God and you as you are a sinner</P>
<P>In the third place I shall add but one Religi|ous action more, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> 1. The Observation of the Sabbath, which yet is, <HI>instar omnium,</HI> where|in
<PB N="76" REF="000358_0075_0FA55528B2B96D88">
all religious actions are summarily compre|hended. You must look upon the Sabbath as the Epitome and Compendium of a Religion, having all the priviledges that commend the most substantial precepts in Scripture to us, as 1. Its frequent mentioning (almost) in every book of the Bible. 2. God's interest (after a special manner) in it; 'tis frequently call'd [<HI>His</HI>] Sabbath. And 3<HI>ly.</HI> 'Tis called a special gift and favour of God to his People, <HI>Exod.</HI> 16.29. <HI>Ezek.</HI>20.12. <HI>Neh.</HI> 9.14. 'Tis a great fa|vour for God that it is given to you.</P>
<P N="2">2. Therefore you must remember to keep it holy, <HI>Exod.</HI>20.8. (it may be read thus) <HI>Re|member to keep holy a day of rest unto me: Six dayes shalt thou labour, but a seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</HI> The very Preface [<HI>Remember</HI>] which none of the other Commands have, instructs you, how weighty and necessary this duty is, which you are prone to forget.</P>
<P N="3">3. That you may keep it holy, you must (in the first place) have an high and holy estima|tion of it; the phrase is, <HI>He that esteemeth a day, and he that regardeth a day,</HI> Rom.14. 5,6. You must have an high regard for it, and esteem it honourable, <HI>Isa.</HI> 58.13. <HI>As the day which the Lord hath made,</HI> Psal.118.12. (This Christ ap|plyes to the day of his Resurrection, <HI>Mat.</HI>21.24) How can it but be an honourable day to you which the Lord your God hath sanctified for you? 2<HI>ly.</HI> As you must have an holy estimati|on
<PB N="77" REF="000358_0076_0FA5552970B26670">
of it, so you must make an holy preparation for it; you must prepare <HI>to meet your God, Amos</HI> 4. 12. As the Bride prepares her self to meet her Bridegroom; how did <HI>Ruth</HI> wash her self, and anoint her, and put on her best raiment, that she might become amiable, and accepted to <HI>Boas?</HI> Ruth 3. 3. How much more should you be purified for the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords! The <HI>Jews</HI> had a preparation for the passeover, <HI>Joh.</HI> 19.42. you must make preparation for the Sabbath, the want of which may hinder your soul of a Sabbath-blessing, as (no doubt) it has done. 3<HI>ly.</HI> You must keep it holy by an holy observation of it, in using all holy means, and doing all holy duties (both private and publick) all the whole day.</P>
<P N="4">4. Be sure it be a desirable day to you, as well as holy and honourable; it should be the desire of dayes. You should cry (with that good man) to it in the morning of the Sabbath. Come my bride of dayes, thou art welcome; and with <HI>Da|vid</HI> say, <HI>Oh when shall I come and appear before my God,</HI> Psal. 42.2, Where are your pantings and palpitations of heart after an enjoyment of Gods Sabbath? You have six dayes to provide for the worser part, and but one for the better: how careful are you all the six dayes for the beast in you? Oh, be not careless upon that one day for the Angel in you.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let not your hold go of any one precious Sabbath, without some sweet refreshment to your
<PB N="78" REF="000358_0077_0FA5552EB790E250">
soul, as well as rest to your body; 'tis said, <HI>Exod</HI> 31.17. <HI>The Lord rested and was refreshed;</HI> is it so with you? do you find any rest for your wand|ring thoughts, and any refreshing for your fee|ble spirit? Account it a very great loss to lose one Sabbath day without some advantage and growth: Oh what a God-blessing heart should you have, that God should give you such a day, and call upon you also (and that often) to ob|serve that day: and that not for any advantage to himself (for <HI>your goodness extends not to God,</HI> Psal.16. 3. though his doth to you) but all for your own good. This obliges you to be careful and conscientious in the improvement of the day, and honouring the Son with his day under the Gospel, as they honoured the Father with his day under the Law, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.23.</P>
<P N="6">6. You shall assuredly be blessed, if you keep the Sabbath which God blessed, <HI>Isa.</HI> 56.2. 1. With Holiness here; the power of godliness lives and dies with the keeping of the Sabbath. 2. You shall be blessed with Happiness hereaf|ter; such as keep holy this Temporal Sabbath, shall be made happy in the Eternal Sabbath; but such as prophane it, shall never enter into God's rest, <HI>Heb.</HI> 3. <HI>ult. &amp;</HI> 4. 9,10.</P>
