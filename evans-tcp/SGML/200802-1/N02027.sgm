<HEAD>AN ANSWER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have not taken Notice of &s;ome Paragraphs, as if I affected Contention; but am wil|ing to &s;et things in a true light, that you may know where we differ in Judgment.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, <HI>One great thing urged again&s;t this Practice is, that it is not lawful</HI> Sir, it is the great Scruple with me; and &s;olve this with a <HI>Thus faith the Lord,</HI> and all other Objections will fall; which till you do, &s;uffer me to di&s;&s;ent from you in Judgment, tho' not in Affection.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, <HI>To make my &s;elf &s;ick in &s;uch a way as may probably &s;erve my Health, and &s;ave my Life, and with &s;uch a de&s;ign, is certainly fitting and rea&s;onable, and therefore lawful.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> I deny it to be fitting or rea&s;onable, becau&s;e 'tis a going out of God's Way, ina&s;much as 'tis not contained in the Law of Phy&s;ick, either natural or di|vine&punc; and therefore unlawful.</P>
<P>Again, you &s;ay, <HI>There is the Fuel of this Distemper in my Body, and it only wants the Spark to &s;et this Fuel a burning; Why may I not let it in by Inci&s;ion, when it may be ea&s;ier, and of le&s;s Danger.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Becau&s;e its not God's way, but its a mixing of humane Inventions with the Rules of Phy|&s;ick.
<PB N="2" REF="002407_0005_0FDB3C0DC07E6378">
Lev. 10. 1. <HI>And Nadab and Abihu took either of them their Cen&s;ers, and put Fire therein, and put In|cen&s;e thereon, and offered &s;trange Fire before the Lord, which be commanded them not.</HI> Now an Action mu&s;t be right with re&s;pect to the Method of doing it, as well as with re&s;pect to the end or event, or it cor|re&s;ponds not with the Sixth Commandment, but is a breaking of all the Law and Commandments. Now to propo&s;e to do &s;omething in Obedience to one Com|mandment, which does Violence unto the re&s;t, can|not be allowed to be the keeping of that.</P>
<P>Again, you &s;ay, <HI>In this way we receive it in a na|tural way;</HI> (which I deny, for it is Anti-natural,) <HI>and if we receive it in either way, it is &s;till the Work of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> I di&s;tingui&s;h between the Works of God, as they are good or evil. Now the Work of God may be con&s;ider'd good, as he wills it, and by his Power effects it; but as Actions may be con&s;ider'd evil, &s;o he willingly permits it.</P>
<P>Again, you &s;ay, <HI>What is there of the Hand or Power of Man in this Work after the Inci&s;ion is made, and the Matter applyed. An&s;wer.</HI> There is the dre&s;&s;ing of the Inci&s;ion Seven or Eight Days. And Sir, if you think the Patient is under the Hand of God after the Inci&s;ion is made, why cannot you as well let him &s;tay till God &s;ees meet to bring the Di&s;temper upon him. You allow that the cutting the Inci&s;ion, and putting the Matter in, is the Hand and Power of Man; which is as much as to &s;ay, (what I &s;hould be loth to &s;ay) That you &s;et your Maker to work, by making the Inci&s;ion for Him; and &s;o you make Inoculation part|ly in the Hand and Power of Man, and partly in the Hand and Power of God: But I tell you, Sir, the Acti|on is entirely humane, as not agreeing with the Law of Phy&s;ick, either natural or divine, and an Intru&s;ion upon the incommunicable Attributes of God, who
<PB N="3" REF="002407_0006_0FDB3C0EF99FFBD0">
hath &s;aid, <HI>I kill, and I make alive, I wound, and I heal..</HI></P>
<P>Again, you &s;ay, <HI>Should this Town be to &s;uffer an In|undation, from a Righteous God for the Puni&s;hment of their Sins, would any think it to be a Criminal Eva|&s;ion to &s;ave their Lives by a Boat or a Plank?</HI></P>
<P>Sir, the Simile I conceive reaches not the Ca&s;e. I di&s;tingui&s;h between a doing what is lawful to <HI>pre|vent</HI> any Sickne&s;s that is &s;ent as a Judgment upon a People, and a voluntary Act of our own in putting forth our Hands to reach the Judgment to our &s;elves, that &s;o by this Means we may avert the Stroke of Heaven, by turning of it out of the ordinary way of Providence. But now I &s;hall &s;tate the Ca&s;e of this Similitude, and I think more adapted to the mat|ter in hand. Suppo&s;e the Water &s;hould be kept out of this Town by Floodgates, and upon the Ap|proach of &s;ome very high Tide, which would over|flow or break down the Gates, a Man &s;hould open the Gates a little &s;o as that the Water might come in gra|dually to prevent its breaking down the Gates, if not|with&s;tanding the Flood &s;hould be greater than he ex|pected (as &s;ometimes in the Ca&s;e of Inoculation) and overflow the Town, if he can have neither Boat nor Plank to &s;ave his Life, will it not be ju&s;t upon him for his pre&s;umptuous Action? Now God hath as ma|ny ways to puni&s;h a People, &s;ave one (to wit, by the Small Pox, which you &s;ay is a Ble&s;&s;ing when receiv'd by Inoculation) as he had before: Therefore prepare to meet thy God, O Zion, (in a way of Duty) and do not go into the Inventions of the Heathen, whom the Lord ca&s;t our before thee.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Is it unlawful to u&s;e Means for our Pre&s;er|vation from a de&s;olating Judgment, e&s;pecially if at that time God &s;hows us a way to e&s;cape the Severity of it?</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, I &s;hall keep evermore the Di&s;tinction (which is laudable and good) between God's &s;hew|ing
<PB N="4" REF="002407_0007_0FDB3C1378153D20">
us the way of Self-pre&s;ervation, and his permit|ting of Man to go into his own by-ways, which ne|ver entered into God's Heart.</P>
<P>Again, you &s;ay, <HI>Some object and &s;ay, Tis originaly from the Devil&punc;</HI> (which is too true to make a Je&s;t of.) You an&s;wer, <HI>If it is a Method of Safety, and a Benefit to Mankind, as hitherto it appears to be, how came the Devil to be the Author of it, who is a Murderer from the beginning.</HI> I an&s;wer, the Devil hath many ways to advance his own Ends, for he is an old Sophi&s;ter, we know. And now, Sir, if I may be &s;uffered to &s;peak my own dige&s;ted Thoughts; with grief of Heart I do &s;eriou&s;ly believe its a Delu&s;ion of the De|vil; and that there was never the like Delu&s;ion in New-England, &s;ince the Time of the Witchcraft at Salem, when &s;o many innocent Per&s;ons lo&s;t their Lives, and afterwards &s;ome of them that were in&s;trumental in taking their Lives away, made a Recantation. And that this People may &s;ee their Error and recant, is the &s;ole Rea&s;on of my putting of Pen to Paper and Prayer to the God of Truth, that this People may &s;ee their Error. Now I will &s;how you how Satan may advance his Intere&s;t and that in his own old Way, Gen. 3. 1. <HI>And he &s;aid unto the Woman. Yea, hath God &s;aid, ye &s;hall not eat of every Tree in the Garden?</HI> Ver&s;e 4, 5. <HI>And the Serpent &s;aid, ye &s;hall not &s;urely die,</HI> (in this new way.) <HI>For God doth know, that in the Day ye eat thereof, then your Eyes &s;hall be opened.</HI> Now Satan had a double end in this; as fir&s;t, The breaking of God's righteous Law; and &s;econdly, the eternal Ruin of Mankind; but the Temptation was the Fruit of the Garden, which no que&s;tion was alluring unto the Sen&s;es, when the Exerci&s;e of Grace was &s;u&s;pend|ed. Now, Sir, as I humbly conceive, <HI>Inoculation</HI> is the thing propo&s;ed, the brave alluring yellow Apple, which is &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in the Event, even Life, as &s;e|veral of your Order have &s;et forth. But Satan may
<PB N="5" REF="002407_0008_0FDB3C14B55C6298">
have another end in it, to wit, the making the Means of Grace un&s;ucce&s;sful, in bringing the fir&s;t Venders and Abettors, and Promoters of Inoculation, which every Body knows were certain Mini&s;ters of this Town) into Contempt; tho' now &s;ome of our Coun|try Mini&s;ters have imbib'd this Doctrine too; one of them, la&s;t Sabbath Day was Two Weeks, in his Pray|er u&s;ed this Phra&s;e&punc; <HI>Some of our People are gone out to meet the Rod, and to ki&s;s it.</HI> Out! Whether are they gone out! Out &s;ure enough! Not out of God's Ble&s;&s;ing into a warm Sun; No, no: They are gone out of God's way of waiting upon him all the Days of their appointed Time, until their Change &s;hall come. But as for Five of them (within this Three Weeks) they are gone out indeed; out of the World! And now the Devil and-all the Promoters and Admi|rers of of Inoculation cannot deceive us; for we have followed them to their Graves, and they will not re|turn, until the Heavens be no more. 2<HI>dly,</HI> You &s;ay, <HI>to meet the Rod.</HI> Sir, where did you meet with this indige&s;ted Phra&s;e for your People that have put them|&s;elves into a way to have the Small Pox, and to pre|&s;cribe both the Di&s;ea&s;e and the Time when. I wi&s;h you would make your Bible more the Rule of Prayer as well as of Practice. 3<HI>dly,</HI> You &s;ay, <HI>and to ki&s;s it.</HI> Ay, &s;o you might, had not God lately made you to know, that it is dangerous medling with Ege Tools, and &s;how'd you that you are Fools that will be med|ling. May you &s;port it with the Holy one of I&s;ra|el? May you not &s;ee your &s;elves pourtrayed in Ho&s;. 5. 5. <HI>The Pride of I&s;rael doth te&s;tify unto his face; therefore &s;hall I&s;rael and Ephraim fall in their Iniquity; Judah al&s;o &s;hall fall with them.</HI> Hath not God &s;pit in your Faces? and will you not be a&s;ha|med? Mal 2. 3. <HI>Behold, I will corrupt your &s;eed, and &s;pread Dung upon your Faces, even the Dung of your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, and one &s;hall take you away with it.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="002407_0009_0FDB3C15C054DE90">
Ver&s;e 7. <HI>For the Priests Lips &s;hould keep Knowledge, and they &s;hould &s;eek the Law at his Mouth; for he is the Me&s;&s;enger of the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> Ver&s;e 8. <HI>But ye are departed out of the way: ye have cau&s;ed many to &s;tumble at the Law: ye have corrupted the Covenant of Levi, faith the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> Ver&s;e 9. <HI>Therefore have I made you contemptible and ba&s;e before all the People, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the Law.</HI></P>
<P>But to return and &s;how how Satan may be carrying on his old Work by this new way. The Town daily re&s;ents your Abu&s;es, and many blacken your Cha|racter, which you ought to pre&s;erve as &s;acred; and they &s;ay, If you are &s;o defective in your Morals, how &s;hall we believe you, when you &s;peak of divine Things? And &s;o you have accrued unto your &s;elves an odious Character in the Minds and Mouths of too many, ay very many, of your Hearers and Contribu|ters. They are prejudiced again&s;t your Per&s;ons, &amp; con|&s;equently again&s;t whatever you teach. I have many times to my Grief heard People &s;ay, that if you un|der&s;tand your own Trade no better than you do Morals, we are in a bad Condition. And they allude unto Gal. 3. 4. <HI>Have ye &s;uffered &s;o many things in vain,</HI> (to withdraw from the Principles and Practice of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and now to bring in the Practice of the Heathen?)

<P>OUR Town &s;eems to be cha&s;ed in their Minds, again&s;t &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, for their intermedling with things which do not be|long to their Function; and do &s;ay, that there is not that Care taken to keep them in their proper Sphere, that they may be u&s;eful to the People.</P>
<P>And now I mu&s;t go back, and call over old things. You may remember when this Governour came fir&s;t, he propo&s;ed to make Money, 100000 <HI>l.</HI> upon Loan, and 50000 <HI>l.</HI> was made before, which was let out to Men upon Mortgages at 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> &s;o that it mu&s;t pay 6300 <HI>l.</HI> U&s;e. The next Year the Governour mov'd to put a &s;top to the Run of it, and said. That there &s;hould be no more made, for it would not be good Times till Silver was the Medium of Trade. Many ignorant Men, that could not &s;ee with the &s;ame Eyes as &s;ome Gentlemen did, thought we were in a bad Condition; for they &s;aid, Here is not enough Money in the Country of that Species to pay U&s;e and Princi|pal too: (It may be they did not under&s;tand Arith|metick.) This put a &s;top to Trade; and many Peo|ple were drove to Hard&s;hips, and fear'd it would be wor&s;e, even that their E&s;tates which were mortga|ged would be forfeited; for nothing el&s;e would re|deem
<PB N="8" REF="002407_0011_0FDB3C18C4471F90">
them but Silver at 6 <HI>s</HI> an Ounce, Seventeen Peny Half-peny Weight; which was the Occa&s;ion of great murmering among the People. About this time there came into the Pulpit a great Orator, and his Text was, <HI>Two Brethren mending their Nets.</HI> He went on, and told the People of the Hard&s;hips their Forefathers underwent for the Go&s;pel; they went to the <HI>Clam-banks</HI> for a Livelyhood And, &s;ays he, <Q>Are your Nets broke; I hope they will mend, I am told things begin to mend already.</Q> Now I take Notice, that had we went to the Clam-Banks for Food, there was no Mony to pay our Taxes, nor to buy a Bottom of Twine to mend our Nets withal. But by and by he &s;ays, <Q>I charge you that you do not mutiny; and God have bid me charge you, that you do not mu|tiny.</Q></P>
<P>Now this Digre&s;&s;ion cau&s;ed &s;everal Thoughts to ari&s;e; as fir&s;t, That he lacked to &s;ee the Time when Silver &s;hould be forced in upon upon us by Nece&s;&s;i|ty; and perhaps he might de&s;ire to hear the Silver to gingle in the Box. Again, 2<HI>dly,</HI> The Tran&s;port that he was in, in charging the People <HI>not to muti|ny;</HI> to &s;ee how he had left his Text: Or whether he &s;pake from an Impul&s;e on his Mind, for we had heard nothing of Mutiny, nor like it before. And this &s;ort of Di&s;cour&s;e put me in mind of a young Scholar I knew in England, who told my Brother, that he had &s;tudied an excellent Di&s;cour&s;e but could not tell what Text to put to it. Says my Brother to him, Pray leave it with us in the Country; for we have more Texts here than excellent Di&s;cour&s;es. Now, whether this was a Di&s;cour&s;e put to a Text, or a Text applyed to this Di&s;cour&s;e, I will not pretend to determine: But I have ob&s;erved more &s;uch Doings and laid them up in my Budget.</P>
<P>The next thing I ob&s;erved was, Supplications by the Mini&s;ters, <HI>That God would teach this People to</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="002407_0012_0FDB3C1A46FC1DD0">
<HI>lead quiet and peaceable Lives.</HI> This put me farther into a Con&s;ternatian; and I could not tell what they meant by repeating it twice a Day &s;o long together, as tho' it was an Article in our Creed that mu&s;t not be omitted. I con&s;idered whether they were not &s;et to work by &s;ome Per&s;ons, and whether this was not an Implicit Charge upon us, that we were not a peacea|ble and quiet People. Now the Mini&s;ter's could not leave off this Form of Words in their Prayer, until the honourable A&s;&s;embly had declared us a loyal and peaceable People, by rejecting the Bill again&s;t Riots and that again&s;t the Liberty of the Pre&s;s, and after|wards in their An&s;wer to the Governour's Speech. It apear'd plainly to me, that there was no need at all for the Law again&s;t Riots, except it was to oblige Mr. <HI>D&mdash;y</HI> the High Sheriff, and Mr. <HI>Y&mdash;s</HI> the Governour's Kin&s;man to keep the Peace; for we know they both broke the Peace &s;oon after that Bill was pro|pos'd to the A&s;&s;embly, and we know al&s;o that they were for having the Bill pa&s;s: Nor was there any need of the Law again&s;t Libels, unle&s;s it was to puni&s;h a certain Clergyman for writing News from <HI>Robin&s;on Cru&s;o's I&s;land:</HI> But I will tell you what came into my mina, The&s;e Men want to make their Neighbour's live <HI>quiet and peaceable Lives,</HI> that they may live <HI>quarrel&s;ome and turbulent Lives;</HI> ju&s;t as &s;ome Folks would make other Men hone&s;t, that they them&s;elves may be Knaves.</P>
<P>Again, It is ob&s;erv'd, that the Mini&s;ters are gene|rally of a contrary Party to the Bulk of the People, with re&s;pect to the publick Affairs here in this Town; and &s;o there is an ill Under&s;tanding between the Mi|ni&s;ters and the People, as &s;ome have complained. I do not think all do oppo&s;e them becau&s;e they would be of a Party again&s;t them; yet it may be &s;ome may do it for as little Rea&s;on as the Counte&s;s of <HI>Pembrook</HI> gave to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> when &s;he came

<P>Again, the Mini&s;ters complain, that this People in the mid&s;t of Judgment are not bettered thereby, but wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e: Here is great Divi&s;ions among us. Now we &s;ay, that &s;everal Mini&s;ters have &s;et up the Doctrine of Inoculation in Publick, and think we do not do well that we do not believe it and practice it, but on the contrary, &s;et light by their Advice: And indeed, we have rea&s;on &s;o to do; for they prove it not from the Word of God to be our Duty; and till they do, let them re&s;ent it how they will, we can|not comply with them; and &s;o we differ in Judg|ment, as they did in <HI>Ahab's</HI> Time. And now the Di&s;pute is no longer, whether there is Animo&s;ities and Contentions between the Mini&s;ters and the People but it lies here, to know where the Fault is. The Mini&s;ters &s;ay, it is becau&s;e they are oppo&s;ed and &s;et light by. The People &s;ay, they oppo&s;e and &s;et light by them, becau&s;e they teach that which is not good but evil unto them. And we read in Prov. 19-27. <HI>Cea&s;e my &s;on to hear the In&s;truction that cau&s;eth to err from the Words of Knowledge,</HI> And the Ca&s;e &s;eems pour rayed in I Kings 18. 17, 18. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s when Ahab &s;aw Elijah, that Ahab &s;aid unto him, Art thou be that troubleth I&s;rael: And he an&s;wered, I have not troubled I&s;rael, but thou and thy Father's Hou&s;e, in that ye have for&s;aken the Commandments of the Lord, and thou ha&s;t followed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> Now we do believe, that you are the People that broached and carryed on by per&s;wa&s;ion, even that which is the breaking of the Commandments of the Lord, and have taught us the Tradition of Men to our own hurt, even ino|culation. Now the&s;e things (together with many more which are in the People's Minds, and in my
<PB N="11" REF="002407_0014_0FDB3C20C454BBF0">
Budget al&s;o,) have di&s;turb'd the People to that De|gree that it makes them inquire after your Com|mi&s;&s;ion: And they find in <HI>Matth.</HI> 18. 18. your Com|mi&s;&s;ion is, <HI>Teach all Nations.</HI> Mark. 16. 15. <HI>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Go&s;pel.</HI> And we can't find, by comparing it with our Annotations, any allowance for Mini&s;ters to make Parliament Men and the like. Your work is divine, your Ma&s;ter is the God of Peace, your Lord the Son of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and Peace, and the Spirit of Peace to lead in the way of Peace: And the Promi&s;e in P&s;alms 84. 11. is to &s;uch as <HI>walk uprightly.</HI> And in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 19, 20. we find, that the Words of RECONCILIATION are committed unto you, and you are to <HI>pray us to be reconciled unto God.</HI> Now if Mini&s;ters will be Party-<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and undertake to lead the Van in other things, which are not in their Commi&s;&s;ion, they may expect no Ble&s;&s;ing on their Endeavours, nor indeed but lit|tle Succe&s;s; for 'tis in God's way that he hath pro|pos'd his Ble&s;&s;ing. <HI>Teach them to ob&s;erve all things</HI> which I command you; <HI>and to, I am with you to the end of the World. Amen.</HI> Math. 28. 19. And the P&s;almi&s;t annexes a Ble&s;&s;ing unto them that walk ac|cording to this Rule; <HI>Mercy and Peace be upon them.</HI> Now, had not the Mini&s;ters went out of their Sphere, both in <HI>England</HI> and here too, People would not have opened their Mouths again&s;t them for being the Starters and Promoters of Divi&s;ion. We have not forgotten the Confu&s;ion that aro&s;e in <HI>Sacheverill's</HI> Day, when he went out of his Sphere, tho' he was as learned a Man as any of you, as I have heard; yet the Land will not clear him from being a de&s;igning Man: But be his de&s;ign what it would, he was the Fomenter of much Divi&s;ion, as well as you. Now the People are afraid, the Mini&s;ters do affect a Rule over them in Temporals, as the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> does temporally as well as &s;piritually, rule and determine

things. Jer. 5. 31. <HI>The Prophets prophe&s;ie folly, and the Prie&s;ts bear Rule by their means; and what will ye do in the end thereof.</HI> And &s;ome &s;ay we are Prie&s;t-ridden; others &s;ay that they will not be Prie&s;t-ridden; others &s;ay we are not <HI>Spaniards</HI> to bear this Prie&s;t-riding; others &s;ay they are <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and are not us'd to be Prie&s;t-ridden. And we will not mind what they &s;ay, but when they are in the Di&s;charge of their Ma&s;ter's Commi&s;&s;ion; (and I wi&s;h the People would do that, &s;eeing there is &s;uch Heart-burnings,) And that was it we call'd them to, and for that we will pay them; and for tho&s;e &s;uperfluous things which their Ma&s;ter nor we never &s;et them about, we will not thank them for: For &s;uppo&s;e a Prince &s;hould &s;end an Amba&s;&s;ador to a foreign Court, and give him his In&s;tructions what he &s;hall do, and what he &s;hall negociate; if he &s;hould thro' a great Opinion of his own Parts, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> from a Willingne&s;s to plea&s;e the Court, negociate up|on or abort any thing that was not in his Credentials, &s;hall not his Ma&s;ter blame him for his Conduct. Now Gentlemen, if you take a View of your Actions, you will be of the &s;ame Opinion with us, That you have breached almo&s;t all the Things that have &s;tir|red up Strife; and being broached, have blown them, tip unto that Heigth that they now are in. I am in|formed, that there was a certain Gentleman in our Town, tied his Hor&s;e at the Door of one of my Neighbours, and went into his Hou&s;e, and tarryed &s;ome time: In the mean time &s;ome Body put a good quantity of Tar on the Saddle; and the Gentleman came forth and rode home without perceiving the Tar, and &s;o &s;poil'd his Breeches. Now by good Con|&s;equence it is infer'd, that it was a mi&s;take, and that the Man thought it was Dr. <HI>B&mdash;u's</HI> Hor&s;e. Now the &s;poiling of the Gentleman's Breeches is laid unto &s;ome of our Mini&s;ters Charge: Not that it's &s;uppo&s;ed any of them did lay the Tar upon the Saddle; (for I
<PB N="13" REF="002407_0016_0FDB129EDD9C8930">
would put the Saddle upon the right Hor&s;e,) but in a remote Sen&s;e they were; as thus, They found out the Practice of Inoculation in Hi&s;tory; (tho' it would have been well for this poor Town, if at that time they had been &s;tudying Divinity.) 2<HI>dly,</HI> They put the Doctor upon it, and incourag'd him in it, and per&s;waded People to come into the Practice. 3<HI>dly,</HI> By this means the Man was incen&s;ed again&s;t the Doctor, and (as he thought) acted a Piece of Revenge upon him, which was to &s;oil the Saddle and &s;poil his Breeches. Now it is thought, that the Mini&s;ters that have &s;o highly promoted Inoculation, &s;hould make a gathering for this Gentleman; if not four-fold, yet at lea&s;t enough to &s;atisfy him for the Lo&s;s of his Breeches.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But this was a riotous Action, and you &s;ay we are a quiet and peaceable People.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> So we are a quiet and peaceable People, genarally &s;peaking, notwith&s;tanding this In&s;tance and one or two more to the contrary. Yea, our Mini&s;ters did &s;ay in their Addre&s;s to the King, (if I am not mi&s;taken,) that we were a loyal and peaceable People, even to a Man. And now I would ask the Mini&s;ters the following Que&s;tions.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. Whether we may not di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween complaining under Oppre&s;&s;ion, and being a mu|tinous People?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t,</HI> 2. Whether this People have not learned to live quiet and peaceable Lives; and whether your keeping up this Prayer, <HI>That God would teach us to live quiet and peaceable Lives,</HI> be not an implicit bearing fal&s;e Witne&s;s again&s;t thy Neighbour?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 3. Whether by your Credentials you ought not every Sabbath Day to have made Supplications for our Brethren at the Ea&s;tward, who are in jeo|pardy of their Lives in the High Places?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 4. Whether the Bu&s;ine&s;s that our Brethren
<PB N="14" REF="002407_0017_0FDB3C269AA55D88">
are gone upon is not of Importance, &s;ince they are to apprehend tho&s;e that are Enemies to the King, and to the King of Kings.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 5. Whether by your Silence you do not give People rea&s;on to think, that you are much in Alliance with tho&s;e that are for a Peacable War?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 6. Whether the &s;ecret Mi&s;teries of State be in your Credentials?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 7. Whether your Credentials have not Matter enough for all your Strength and Parts, with|out running into other Men's Bounds? P&s;al. 139.6. <HI>Such Knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 8. Whether your Prayer &s;o long kept up, was not the Motive of the Governour's complain|ing to the be&s;t of Kings, again&s;t as good Subjects as ever a King rul'd?</P>
<P>A certain Gentleman of the learned Seminary of Cambridge, &s;ays, <HI>He wonders that</HI> John Williams's <HI>Book do &s;ell &s;o well; for all the Arguments he brings again&s;t Inoculation might be turned again&s;t Tobacco.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e you may &s;pare time enough from the Pulpit to turn them again&s;t it; for I know of no Call you have to preach every Week; and the &s;moak|ing of Tobacco being a tender Article with me, I &s;hould have looked upon my &s;elf obliged to have return'd an An&s;wer to the Reverend Mr. <HI>G&mdash;e.</HI></P>
<P>He further goes on to &s;ay, <HI>He would have our Mob come up to</HI> Cambridge, <HI>and pull down the College, and turn the Students down into Father</HI> Williams'<HI>s Cellar, to learn Logick, Phy&s;ick, and Divinity.</HI></P>

But Sir, Why would you have the Colledge pull'd down? I am not of your Mind: Let it &s;tand, and more and more flouri&s;h; but I am grieved that any that are educated there, &s;hould be &s;o dull Schollars, as not to learn <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum.</HI></P>
<P>Again, you propo&s;e, <HI>That all the Schollars that are at Cambridge &s;hould come down to learn the Liberal Arts of me, in my Cellar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e there is room enough in my Cel|lar to hold you all; for I under&s;tand there is none there now but your &s;elf, and you will be my only Pupil. And as for my teaching you Divinity, its like you have enough of that already, unle&s;s you could have had a Call to the New North Meeting Hou&s;e. And as for Phy&s;ick, my teaching you will &s;ignify no|thing; for unle&s;s I could in&s;tall you with the Title of <HI>Doctor of Phy&s;ick,</HI> you mu&s;t expect to follow my Steps, and give Advice <HI>gratis,</HI> which I &s;uppo&s;e you will not admire. And then with re&s;pect to Logick, a &s;mall quantity of that will do, provided you always remember to &s;upply the want of it with good Store of Sophi&s;try. However, I will give my Pupil the following Maxims that I have received in Logick, and let him take them or leave them, as they will be&s;t befit the Imployment he goes upon.</P>

and Actings, being altogether different from, yes, and totally contrary to the &s;ecular Government. And we conceive there is no &s;uch Difficulty in the Mat|ter, but that Mini&s;ters may be kept within the in|violable Bounds of their mo&s;t holy Calling, and yet be u&s;eful to the Publick, without tho&s;e little Arts of Subtleties and Surpri&s;als, which abut at no other Mark than temporal and carnal Profit. Be|&s;ides that, its a very rare, thing to find a Man capable both of the one and the other Calling: There is this grand Mi&s;chief in it, that Fle&s;h and Blood &s;eeing in the holy Mini&s;try nothing but what is mean and humble, de&s;picable and painful, difficult and dangerous, and contrariwi&s;e, meeting in the ma|nagement of &s;ecular Affairs, with Food &amp; fuel enough for Pride, Ambition and Covetou&s;ne&s;s, (the Grounds of all Envys and Jealou&s;ies,) and with Means and Helps to carry on De&s;igns of Self-Advancement and Domination, as Tricks, Crafts, Di&s;&s;imulation, it will be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to hinder the &s;preading of this Con|tagion, which creeps in&s;en&s;ibly into the greate&s;t Wits, and &s;eizeth upon them at unawares, and not as an affected and approved Vice.

If the ne|ce&s;&s;ity be ab&s;olute, peremptory and indi&s;pen&s;able, then let them go about &s;uch &s;ecular, political Af|fairs with Regret and Grief, troubled at their en|forced Di&s;traction from their Heavenly Calling, la|menting as the Spou&s;e in the Caticles, that <HI>they have made me keeper of the Vineyards, but my own Vineyard have I not kept.</HI> No Man going to War, intangles him&s;elf with the World, that &s;o he may the better plea&s;e his Captain that hath in&s;i&s;ted him.
