<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON SOME FATAL MISTAKES, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN the great St. Paul, in his epi&s;tle to the Romans, had a mind to lay a &s;o|lid foundation for the grand di&s;tingui&s;h|ing doctrines of the go&s;pel, I need not inform you, that, like a wi&s;e ma&s;ter-builder, he takes care to dig deep into the corruption of human nature; and, after having given us a lively portraiture of the univer&s;al depravity of the Gentile world, proceeds, in a mo&s;t ma&s;terly manner, to bring down the proud thoughts and high imaginations of the &s;elf-righteous and formal Phari&s;ees, by proving, to a demon&s;tration, that the Jewi&s;h profe&s;&s;ors, notwith&s;tanding all their peculiar advantages of external revelation, circumci|&s;ion, near affinity to Abraham, and &s;uch like, were all equally included under &s;in, were all equally guilty before God, had all equally fallen &s;hort of his glory, con&s;equently were all upon an equal level with the re&s;t of mankind, and &s;tood as much in need of the free grace of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and the &s;anctifying operations of his Holy Spirit, as the mo&s;t &s;avage Bar|barians or di&s;puting Greek. This was acting like the forerunner or harbinger of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord: for
<PB N="4" REF="009539_0003_0F768C61EF19FFA8">
when he &s;aw many of the Sadducees and Phari&s;ees (the infidels and profe&s;&s;ors of that age) coming to his bapti&s;m, di&s;regarding, as it were, the former, in a very pungent, and, what &s;ome would term, a very unpolite manner, he thus addre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf to the lat|ter: <Q>O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to free from the wrath to come? And think not to &s;ay within your&s;elves, We have Abraham for our father: for I &s;ay unto you, God is able of the&s;e &s;tones to rai&s;e up children unto Abraham.</Q> But why &s;peak I of acting like the forerunner? I &s;hould rather have &s;aid, this was imitating our com|mon Lord him&s;elf, who, in his glorious and divine &s;ermon, (when, to u&s;e the words of the &s;eraphic Her|vey, a mount was his pulpit, and the heavens were his &s;ounding-board), employs him&s;elf chiefly in detec|ting the fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es and corrupt interpretations of the then ma&s;ters of I&s;rael, withal adding this cutting a&s;|&s;ertion, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>Unle&s;s your righteou&s;ne&s;s exceeds the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, ye &s;hall in no ca&s;e enter into the kingdom of heaven.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT a pity is it, my dear friend, that our mo|dern defenders of Chri&s;tianity, in their elaborate and undoubtedly well-meant treati&s;es, have not been more &s;tudious to copy after &s;uch bright and unerring examples! Many of the&s;e I know you have read; and am per&s;uaded, out of your u&s;ual candour, will do them &s;o much ju&s;tice as to acknowledge, that, in re|&s;pect to the out-works of religion, &s;uch as clearing up the prophecies of the Old, and vindicating the mira|cles of the New Te&s;tament, again&s;t the attacks of In|fidels and Freethinkers, they have &s;hewn them&s;elves, as far as bare human learning, added to external re|velation, can carry them, to be ma&s;ters of &s;trong rea|&s;oning, nervous language, and conclu&s;ive arguments. But then, as I have often heard you lament, one thing they &s;eem to lack, <HI>viz.</HI> a deeper and more ex|perimental
<PB N="5" REF="009539_0004_0F768C628FC7BFC8">
knowledge of them&s;elves and Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Hence it is, that when they come to touch upon the internals and vitals of Chri&s;tianity, they are quite grappled, and write &s;o unguardedly of the all-power|ful influences of the Holy Gho&s;t, as to &s;ink us into a &s;tate of downright formality; which, if the apo&s;tle Paul may be our judge, we had need as much to be cautioned again&s;t, as fanatici&s;m, &s;uper&s;tition, or infi|delity it&s;elf: For, in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to Timothy, after giving us a dreadful account of the abounding of wicked men in the la&s;t perilous times, &s;uch as lovers of their own &s;elves, covetous, boa&s;ters, proud, bla&s;|phemers, di&s;obedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, fal&s;e accu|&s;ers, incontinent, fierce, de&s;pi&s;ers of tho&s;e that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of plea|&s;ures more than lovers of God; he brings up the rear in this awful manner, having a form of godline&s;s, but denying the power thereof,&mdash;from &s;uch, &s;ays he, turn away;&mdash;for, to u&s;e the words of our Lord, pu|blicans and harlots enter into tne kingdom of God before them.</P>
<P>SORRY am I to &s;end you word, that a writer of this unhappy &s;tamp now lies upon my table; a writer, who, although he intitles his book, <HI>The Offices and Operations of the Holy Gho&s;t vindicated from the In&s;uits of Infidelity and Abu&s;es of Fanatici&s;m,</HI> yet, in his great zeal again&s;t the latter, and to the no &s;mall encourage|ment of the former, as far as perverted rea&s;on and di&s;|gui&s;ed &s;ophi&s;try could carry him, hath, in effect, robbed the church of Chri&s;t of its promi&s;ed Comforter, and thereby left us, upon whom the ends of the world are come, without any &s;upernatural influence or divine operations what&s;oever. Often have I heard you ob&s;erve, that there never was an age in which the &s;tewards of the my&s;teries of Chri&s;t were more loudly called upon to vindicate the offices and operations of
<PB N="6" REF="009539_0005_0F768C6356568568">
the Holy Spirit than that wherein we live. And for my own part, I cannot help thinking, that the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd and duly qualified per&s;on in the univer&s;e, could he write or &s;peak &s;o exten&s;ively, that the whole world might hear or read him, could not po&s;&s;ibly ex|pre&s;s his love to mankind, in general, and the church of God, which he hath purcha&s;ed with his own blood, in particular, in a more nece&s;&s;ary, com|mendable, and u&s;eful way, than by declaring, upon the hou&s;e-top, that the Holy Gho&s;t, like its almighty purcha&s;er, is the &s;ame to-day as he was ye&s;terday; that he is now, as well as formerly, in the u&s;e of all in&s;tituted means, appointed to convince the world of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and judgment; to lead them in|to all truth, by &s;piritually opening their under&s;tan|dings, that they may under&s;tand the Scriptures; and to renew a clean heart and right &s;pirit within them here, in order that they may be thereby prepared for the full enjoyment of a triune and ever-ble&s;&s;ed God hereafter. This, you will judge, my dear friend, is what any one might have rea&s;onably expected to have met with in a book bearing &s;uch a promi&s;ing title. But, alas! how was I di&s;appointed! and how will you be equally &s;urpri&s;ed, when I tell you, that, upon peru&s;ing the book it&s;elf, I found that the author, in|&s;tead of vindicating or a&s;&s;erting, rather denies and ri|dicules the &s;tanding and unalterable operations of the Holy Gho&s;t. For, having ingeniou&s;ly taken a great deal of learned pains again&s;t the in&s;inuations of Dr. Middleton, to prove that there once was a Holy Gho&s;t; that he did once actually de&s;cend upon the apo&s;tles on the day of Penteco&s;t; and further, that he did once in&s;pire the &s;acred writers to &s;ettle the canon of Scripture; he then, in order to tear up &s;uper&s;tition, and, what he calls, fanatici&s;m, by the roots, takes infinitely greater pains, (as well he might, being a mo&s;t arduous ta&s;k indeed), to &s;hew, that what true believers, in all ages, have always looked upon to be
<PB N="7" REF="009539_0006_0F768C6418C844D0">
the &s;tanding and ordinary operations of the Spirit, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>Such as manife&s;t them&s;elves in grace and knowledge, and which admini&s;ter aid in &s;piritual di&s;tre&s;&s;es, are to be accounted and called miracu|lous, as much as tho&s;e which extended outwards, in the gifts of healing, and the relief of other cor|poreal infirmities; and the&s;e miraculous powers being now, upon the perfect e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;|tianity, <HI>totally withdrawn,</HI> it con&s;equently mu&s;t be &s;uper&s;titious and fanatical to look for, or pretend to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, any of tho&s;e operations which manife&s;t them&s;elves in grace and knowledge, and which admini&s;ter aid in &s;piritual di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</Q> Pages 75.82.83. octavo edition. Strange a&s;&s;ertions the&s;e, you will &s;ay, for a vindicator of the offices and opera|tions of the Holy Gho&s;t, again&s;t the in&s;ults of infide|lity and the abu&s;es of fanatici&s;m! Alas! what could a <HI>Middleton</HI> &s;ay more? Nay, I could almo&s;t add, where hath he expre&s;sly &s;aid &s;o much? But if it be &s;uper&s;tition to look for, if it be fanatici&s;m to &s;eek af|ter, and not re&s;t till we are actually and experimental|ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, the &s;upernatural influences of the Ble&s;|&s;ed Spirit, manife&s;ting them&s;elves in grace and divine knowledge, and affording aid in &s;piritual di&s;tre&s;&s;es; then may you and I, my dear friend, become more and more &s;uper&s;titious and fanatical every day: for I am per&s;uaded, that without &s;uch divine manife&s;ta|tions as exceed the powers of humanity, were we to be &s;igned with the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, in bapti&s;m, a thou&s;and times over, we could never &s;ucce&s;sfully fight under its banner again&s;t &s;in, the world, and the devil, and con&s;equently not &s;o much as truly com|mence, much le&s;s continue to be, Chri&s;t's faithful &s;ervants and &s;oldiers, even to the end of our lives.</P>
<P>SURELY, was the apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> to ri&s;e from the dead, and read over, or hear of, &s;uch &s;trange po&s;i|tions, his &s;pirit, as once at <HI>Athens,</HI> would again be

&s;tirred in him, to &s;ee a writer thus attempting to erect an altar for the wor&s;hip of an unknown God. I &s;ay an unknown God. For how is it po&s;&s;ible, in the very nature of the thing, for us, who are by nature carnal and &s;old under &s;in, ever to wor&s;hip God, who is a &s;pirit, in &s;pirit and in truth, without &s;ome inward manife&s;tations of grace and &s;piritual knowledge, &s;u|peradded to the light of external revelation, to enable us &s;o to do? For, to apply what this apo&s;tle ob&s;erves upon a like occa&s;ion, he is not a real Chri&s;tian who is only one outwardly; but he alone is a true Chri&s;tian, who is one inwardly, who&s;e bapti&s;m is that of th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> heart, in the &s;pirit, and not merely of the water, who&s;e prai&s;e is not of man, but of God. And yet (would you think it?) this writer is &s;o unwary as to attempt to pre&s;s this very apo&s;tle, that true a&s;&s;ertor of the doctrine of grace, that genuine irrefragable vindicator of the offices and operations of the Holy Spirit, into his mi&s;taken &s;ervice. Never, I believe, were the &s;aint and the &s;cholar, the gentleman and the Chri&s;tian, more &s;weetly blended together than in the character and writings of this favourite of heaven. How often, my dear friend, in our more retired mo|ments, when conver&s;ing together concerning the live|ly oracles of God, have you called upon me to take notice of this truly great man's pertinent and powerful preaching before Felix the governor, as well as his inexpre&s;&s;ibly polite and per&s;ua&s;ive addre&s;s to King Agrippa? And how have you again and again read over to me, and made remarks upon, tho&s;e &s;triking images, and tho&s;e divine characteri&s;tics, which this accompli&s;hed ma&s;ter of human and divine rhetoric lays before us in the 13th chapter of his 1&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, of that mo&s;t excellent grace of charity or love of God? A grace &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Chri&s;tian life, that without it, to u&s;e the inimita+ble language of this in&s;pired writer, <HI>though we had a miraculous faith &s;o as to remove mountains, nay though
<PB N="9" REF="009539_0008_0F768C66B52EA790">
we &s;hould give all our goods to feed the poor, and even our bodies to be burnt, it would profit us nothing.</HI> A grace, that never faileth, but a &s;acred &s;omething that we &s;hall eternally remain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and in|crea&s;ing in, even when faith &s;hall end in the vi&s;ion, and hope in the endle&s;s fruition of the ever-ble&s;&s;ed God. Oh, my dear friend, how frequently have our hearts burnt within us, under the glowing warmth of &s;uch an animating pro&s;pect? And yet, incredible as it may &s;eem to you, I a&s;&s;ure you, that this very chapter is &s;ingled out by our haple&s;s author, to prove that &s;u|pernatural manife&s;tations of grace and knowledge of &s;piritual aids in &s;piritual di&s;tre&s;&s;es, were the miracu|lous gifts of the primitive church, and were totally withdrawn on its perfect e&s;tabli&s;hment. Surely a more pertinent one could not be &s;elected out of the whole New Te&s;tament, to prove directly the contrary. For let any man impartially examine the glorious in|&s;eparable properties and concomitants of this divine grace and gift of charity, recorded in this chapter, and then make the lea&s;t doubt whether any per&s;on living can po&s;&s;ibly be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this mo&s;t excellent gift, without tho&s;e very &s;upernatural manife&s;tations of grace and knowledge, and tho&s;e divine influences of the Holy Spirit exceeding the powers of humanity, which this unhappy writer would fain per&s;uade us are now abated or totally withdrawn. <HI>Charity</HI> (&s;ays our apo&s;tle) <HI>&s;uffereth long, and is kind&mdash;Charity envieth not &mdash;Charity vaunteth not it&s;elf, is not puffed up&mdash;&s;eeketh not her own&mdash;is not ea&s;ily provoked&mdash;thinketh no evil&mdash;re|joiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth&mdash;beareth all things &mdash; hopeth all things&mdash;endureth all things.</HI> Now, can human rea&s;on, with all its heights; can calm phi|lo&s;ophy, with all its depths; or moral &s;ua&s;ion, with all its in&s;inuating arts; &s;o much as pretend to kindle, much le&s;s to maintain and blow up into a &s;ettled habi|tual flame of holy fire, &s;uch a &s;park as this in the hu|man heart? Sooner might one attempt to extingui&s;h

the mo&s;t rapid and devouring flames, by reading a lecture upon the benefit of cold water, or reach out one's pre&s;umptuous hand to create a new heaven and a new earth, than to dream of extingui&s;hing tho&s;e in|nate fiery pa&s;&s;ions of envy, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, or malice, which this charity or love of God is here &s;aid to mili|tate again&s;t; or to work or form the &s;oul into any of tho&s;e divine tempers here &s;poken of, as the genuine effects and fruits of the love of God. No, my dear friend, the&s;e are flowers not to be gathered in na|ture's garden. They are exotics; planted originally in heaven, and in the great work of the new birth, tran&s;planted by the Holy Gho&s;t, not only into the hearts of the fir&s;t apo&s;tles or primitive Chri&s;tians, but into the hearts of all true believers, even to the end of the world. For doubtle&s;s of all &s;uch St. Paul &s;peaks, when he &s;ays, <HI>Tribulation worketh patience, patience ex|perience, experience hope, and hope maketh not a&s;hamed, becau&s;e the love of God is &s;hed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Gho&s;t which is given unto us.</HI> And hence, doubt|le&s;s, it is, that we were all in general lately directed, in one of the collects of our church, to pray to that Lord <Q>who hath taught us, that all our doings with|out charity are nothing worth, that he would &s;end the Holy Gho&s;t, and pour into our hearts that mo&s;t excellent gift of charity.</Q> So that, according to our reformers, &s;upernatural influence and manife&s;ta|tions of grace and knowledge are &s;o far from being totally withdrawn, that they, in the end of this very collect, teach us to confe&s;s, that without them, or, which is the &s;ame, without the love of God poured into the heart by the Holy Gho&s;t, <Q>who&s;oever liveth is counted dead before him.</Q> But if we will be|lieve our author, charity &s;ignifies little more than the outward e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Chri&s;tian church, and con&s;equently that the apo&s;tle means no more in this chapter than to &s;hew us, <Q>that prophecies, my&s;teries, knowledge,</Q> (<HI>i. e.</HI> according to this writer, all

&s;upernatural knowledge), <Q>were to cea&s;e when Chri&s;tianity arrived to a perfect e&s;tabli&s;hment.</Q> Page 82.&mdash; Nay, &s;corning to tread in the &s;teps of Whitby, Hammond, Burkit, and every con&s;i&s;tent &s;piritual expo&s;itor of holy writ, our new commentator, out of his paradoxical genius, labours to prove, that when the great apo&s;tle a&s;&s;erts, that charity never &s;ails, and therefore hath the preference over faith and hope, he means nothing le&s;s than to a&s;&s;ert its eternal dura|tion, and that con&s;equently his true meaning hath hi|therto e&s;caped every unwary reader but him&s;elf. Pages 75, 6, 7. Con&s;cious, no doubt, of this &s;in|gularity, and ju&s;tly aware of its needing &s;ome apolo|gy, he very properly adds, page 82. that &s;uch an un|common interpretation <Q>in&s;tructs the unwary reader with what caution and application he &s;hould come to the &s;tudy of that profound rea&s;oning with which all St. Paul's epi&s;tles abound.</Q> And may I not, at lea&s;t with as great propriety, &s;ubjoin, that this may al&s;o in&s;truct every unwary reader with what caution he &s;hould come to the &s;tudy of that profound rea&s;oning with which this treati&s;e abounds? &s;o very profound, that I believe it exceeds the power of humanity to fa|thom its depths, &s;o far as to draw out of it any true, con&s;i&s;tent interpretation of the apo&s;tle's rea&s;oning on this chapter at all.</P>
<P>I might here add, my dear friend, &s;ome other &s;pe|cimens of our author's manner of explaining Scripture by his human rea&s;on: for in&s;tance, "keeping our|&s;elves un&s;potted from the world," he &s;ays, page 157. &s;ignifies only <HI>our u&s;ing the means of grace.</HI> And again when the apo&s;tle informs us, Ephe&s;. v. 9. that the, fruit of the Spirit is in all goodne&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and truth, he tells us, that truth refers to <HI>Chri&s;tian doctrine,</HI> goodne&s;s to <HI>Chri&s;tian practice,</HI> and by righ|teou&s;ne&s;s is meant <Q>the conduct of the whole to par|ticulars, and con&s;i&s;ts in that equal gentlene&s;s of

Eph. v. 9.</NOTE>;</Q> with &s;everal &s;uch like in&s;tances, which even the mo&s;t unwary reader, without much &s;tudy or application, may meet with &s;cattered up and down this author's performance: but this would be too great a digre&s;&s;ion: And indeed I &s;hould not have dwelt &s;o long even upon this extra|ordinary interpretation of the thirteenth chapter of the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, had not this writer him&s;elf called it this <HI>deci&s;ive pa&s;&s;age,</HI> and given it as his opinion, that this is the only expre&s;s declaration recorded in Scripture, p. 76. to prove, that all &s;u|pernatural knowledge or divine influence was to cea&s;e, when Chri&s;tianity was perfectly e&s;tabli&s;hed, or the world arrived at a perfect Chri&s;tian &s;tate. But every day's experience, nay, this author's very book, prov|ing beyond all doubt, that Chri&s;tianity is not as yet thus perfectly e&s;tabli&s;hed, we may, at lea&s;t as yet, according to his own principles, expect divine mani|fe&s;tations of grace and knowledge, and &s;piritual aids under &s;piritual di&s;tre&s;&s;es, without ju&s;tly incurring the imputation either of &s;uper&s;tition or fanatici&s;m.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed&mdash;However profound and intel|ligible our author's comments may be, yet, when he comes to &s;hew the rea&s;onablene&s;s and fitne&s;s of this thing, <HI>viz.</HI> an abatement or total withdrawing of di|vine influence in the&s;e la&s;t days, (and wo to the Chri&s;ti|an world if he &s;ucceeds in his unhallowed attempt), he &s;peaks intelligibly enough:&mdash;For thus writes our author.&mdash;<Q>On the Spirit's fir&s;t de&s;cent upon the apo&s;tles, he found their minds rude and uninform|ed, &s;trangers to all cele&s;tial knowledge, prejudiced

But what a total ignorance of human nature, and of the true unalterable genius of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, doth our author's arguing di&s;cover? For &s;uppo&s;ing, my dear friend, that this or any other writer &s;hould undertake to prove that the ancient Greeks and Romans were born with &s;ickly, di&s;ordered, and crazy bodies, but that we, in modern days, being made of a firmer mould, and being ble&s;&s;ed with the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of Galen and Hippocrates, need now no further a&s;&s;i&s;|tance from any pre&s;ent phy&s;ician, either to explain or apply tho&s;e rules to our pre&s;ent ails and corporeal di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, though we could not, without the help of &s;ome lingui&s;t &s;uperior to our&s;elves, &s;o much as under|&s;tand the language in which tho&s;e authors wrote: &mdash; Suppo&s;ing, I &s;ay, any one was to take it into his head to write in this manner: Would he not be ju&s;tly deemed a dreaming enthu&s;ia&s;t or real fanatic?

For as it was formerly, &s;o it is now, the natural man di&s;cerneth not the things of the Spirit. And why? Becau&s;e they can only be &s;piritually di&s;cerned. But when is it that we mu&s;t believe this author? For, page 73. he talks of &s;ome of the <Q>fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, who were in the happy circum&s;tance of being found innocent, when they were led into the practice of all virtue by the Holy Spirit.</Q> And what occa&s;ion for that, if found in|nocent? But how innocent did the Holy Spirit find them? Doubtle&s;s ju&s;t as innocent as it finds us, <HI>viz.</HI> conceived and born in &s;in; having in our fle&s;h, <HI>i. e.</HI> our depraved nature, no good thing; bringing into the world with us a corruption which renders us lia|ble to God's wrath and eternal damnation; with a carnal mind, which is enmity again&s;t God, and a heart, the thoughts and imaginations of which are declared to be only evil, and that continually; and who&s;e native and habitual language, though born and educated under a Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, is identically the &s;ame as that of the Jews, <HI>viz. We will not have the Lord Je&s;us to reign over us.</HI> This, and this alone, my dear friend, is all the innocence that every man, naturally engendered of the offspring of <HI>Adam,</HI> whe|ther born in the antediluvian, patriarchal, Mo&s;aic, apo&s;tolic, or pre&s;ent age, can boa&s;t of. And if this be matter of fact, (and who that knows him&s;elf can deny it?), it is &s;o far from being &s;uper&s;titious or fana|tical to a&s;&s;ert the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a divine influ+ence, or a power &s;uperior to that of humanity, that it is a mo&s;t irrefragable argument for its continuance without the lea&s;t abatement or withdrawing what&s;oe|ver.

And if &s;o, what becomes of our author's arguments to &s;hew the fitne&s;s of an abate|ment or total withdrawing of divine influence in the&s;e go&s;pel-days? Might he not, with as great con&s;i&s;tency, have undertaken to &s;hew the fitne&s;s of an abatement or total withdrawing of the irradiating light and geni|al warmth of the natural &s;un? For, as the earth, on which we tread, &s;tands as much in need now of the abiding influence of the genial rays of that great lumi|nary in order to produce, keep up, and complete the vegetative life in gra&s;s, fruits, plants, and flowers, as it did in any preceding age of the world; &s;o our earthly hearts do now, and always will, &s;tand in as much need of the quickening, enlivening, transform|ing influences of the Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that glori|ous Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the hearts of the fir&s;t apo&s;tles; if not to make us preachers, yet to make us Chri&s;tians, <HI>viz.</HI> by beginning, carrying on, and completing that holine&s;s in the heart and life of every believer in every age, without which no man living &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.

For, are we not therein taught to pray, that we may be filled with all the fulne&s;s of God, and to wait for a glorious epocha, when the earth &s;hall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the &s;eas?
