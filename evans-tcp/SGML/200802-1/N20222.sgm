<P>THERE was certainly a critical time, when the world was entirely happy, and ble&s;&s;ed with content; when there was no cheating, &s;landering, envying, nor robbing and plunder|ing one another, and con&s;equently no gibbets, pillories, whipping po&s;ts, &amp;c. Covetou&s;ne&s;s was not known in tho&s;e days, but nature was liberal to all her &s;ons, and gave a plentiful &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence to every diligent hand: Men cropped the &s;weets of the earth, and had it for their pains; no Landlords then oppre&s;'d their Tenants to fill their bags with wicked GOLD. Prie&s;ts did not &s;ell their Faith for Lucre&punc; nor Maids their virginity for pride. No Son cut his Father's Throat to come at his bags; nor Mother bawd|ed for her Daughter, to &s;hare the reward. Such a time there was, but Hi&s;torians have been &s;o negligent as not to tran&s;mit it to the&s;e &s;inful Times: However, &s;ince we have the Liberty to gue&s;s, I &s;hall build upon a very &s;trong Pre&s;ump|tion, that it was before the invention of MON|EY; and it has puzzled &s;ome great Philo&s;ophers to find out, whether it has not de&s;troyed more People in the other World, than Gunpowder has done in this. As &s;oon as this wicked Mammon &s;prung up among Men they left their Maker's Image to wor&s;hip Ce&s;ar's; then &s;prung up Cor|ruptions in the world, and the dark Seeds of co|vetou&s;ne&s;s, U&s;ury, Extortion, Cheating and Knavery began to grow apace. Here was one cutting his neighbour's Throat for being richer than him&s;elf; and another &s;elling his &s;oul that he
<PB N="4" REF="026511_0003_0FD083994B36E538">
may be richer than his Neighbour. Ju&s;tice was bought and &s;old like a pig in a market, the grea|te&s;t bidder went away with it. Money made a man righteous, and poverty made him a rogue: the &s;in-offering of the poor was de&s;pi&s;ed, but the fat &s;acrifice of the rich perfumed it with the in|cen&s;e of the altar. The temple became the prie&s;t's &s;hop, where religion was &s;old by retail; according to the laudable expre&s;&s;ion of a famous author:
<Q><L>Natural religion ea&s;y was and plain,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> made it fabulous, Prie&s;ts made it gain;</L>
<L>And next the &s;acrifices were prepar'd,</L>
<L>The prie&s;ts eat roa&s;t meat, and the people &s;tarv'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>Money was both religion and laws, no penny, no pater-no&s;ter; no money, no ju&s;tice; a bad cau&s;e with a big pur&s;e, was &s;ure to carry it from a good cau&s;e and a light one; and to this day, if you have retained a council, 'tis a thou&s;and to one but he forgets your face, if you dont give him a &s;econd token to remember you by. If covet|ou&s;ne&s;s be the root of all evil, 'tis money is the root of all covetou&s;ne&s;s. No &s;ooner was Dei Gratia &s;tampt upon the&s;e enticing metals, but people forgot it in their prayers, and paid all de|votion to mammon, wicked mammon. Selling and buying became &s;o vehement among men, that for intere&s;t they &s;old one another; example, Jo|&s;eph was &s;old by his brethren; Judas &s;old his ma&s;ter; the S&mdash;h &s;old their King; and how many Judas's of our age, have &s;old their contry!

would you corrupt a man's hone&s;ty, or a wo|man's virtue, tempt them with money; 'tis a charm &s;o &s;trong, there is no with&s;tanding it.&mdash;Would you have your neighbour's throat cut, money will do it. Would you lay with your neighbour's wife, money will introduce you.&mdash;'Tis the key to a &s;tate&s;man's brea&s;t, and lets out all its &s;ecrets; it will bring you to my lady's bed, and will keep my lord's mouth &s;hut. 'Twill make the crooked &s;trait, and the &s;trait crooked. Let a woman have a good portion, and though &s;he is as deformed as a crooked billet, &s;he will go off, though others both beautiful and virtu|ous, for want of it, &s;tick a hand.</P>
<P>Let a powdered coxcombly beau, with round &s;houlders, and a hatchet face, have a gilt chariot, and a fine equipage, the people &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;pend their judgment, there goes a pretty Gentleman, though he is extremly like a dog in a doublet, or a hog in armour.&mdash;A man that has money, is qualified for any po&s;t, while his wi&s;er and hone&s;ter neighbours are neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed for the want of it. In &s;hort, money is a bewitching thing, and they are mad that &s;et there hearts upon it. Riches are a perplexed &s;tate; and a little with contentment, is better than all the wealth in the world. In my opinion, he was a happier man that &s;old his fle&s;h to a jew, than the extorting infidel that bought it. Murder, whoredom, trea&s;on, felony, &amp;c. are the offspring of &s;atan; and money is the grand parent of them all. The u&s;urer gets over his bags, and prays to this effect.</P>

<P>In the mean time his &s;ervants pray as heartily for food, and with his neck as long as his bags, for not keeping a better hou&s;e; but 'tis no won|der he neglects their bodies, when the &s;ame rea|&s;on makes him forget his own &s;oul.</P>
<P>A rich man is a mere &s;hip in the tempe&s;t, al|ways to&s;&s;ing and tumbling in the perplexity of his affairs, and if he chance to meet with &s;ome dire unexpected ill fortune, he &s;inks downright, and becomes mi&s;erable; he is always accompani|ed with fear and concern, and even in the calme&s;t of his bu&s;ine&s;s is never truly contented; while a man in a moderate condition, that carries mo&s;t of his wealth about him, enjoys him&s;elf with a thou&s;and times the &s;atisfaction. The careful father, like a true wi&s;e man, breaks his re&s;t, di&s;|compo&s;es his mind, and makes his whole life unea&s;y; to get an e&s;tate for his &s;on, who &s;pends it like a fool as &s;oon as he is dead.</P>
<P>Were money a ble&s;&s;ing, the Jews would nev|er be &s;o univer&s;ally rich; and he that &s;its with a piece of bread and chee&s;e, and content, under a hedge, may be a happier man, than he that re|vels
