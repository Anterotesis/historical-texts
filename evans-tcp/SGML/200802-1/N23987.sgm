<HEAD>THE PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ALMIGHTY GOD,</HI> who ha&s;t created all things, and by who&s;e providence they are upheld and directed; we, thy rational creatures, e&s;teem it our duty to take all &s;uitable occa&s;ions of acknow|ledging our dependence upon thee, of venerating thy infinite greatne&s;s, of adoring thy wi&s;dom and power, and of thanking thee for thy ine&s;timable benefits.</P>
<P>We are &s;en&s;ible, that we are continually in thy pre&s;ence, and accountable to thee for all our ac|tions: and, therefore, we feel our&s;elves intere&s;ted, in praying "that thou woulde&s;t direct us, in all our doings, with thy mo&s;t gracious favour, and further us with thy continual help; that, in all our works begun, continued, and ended in thee, we may glorify thy holy name, and finally by thy mer|cy obtain everla&s;ting life."</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="031736_0003_0FED3832E4AE78F0">Nor do we &s;olicit thy gracious favour and pro|tection for our&s;elves only; but, con&s;idering our&s;elves as members of thy great family of mankind, we entreat thee to have mercy on all men. Provide for their nece&s;&s;ities; and grant, that, in all their en|joyments, they may remember thee who art the au|thor of their enjoyments,&mdash;and who, at the &s;ame time that thou "give&s;t liberally to all men, up|braide&s;t them not." Di&s;po&s;e them to con&s;ider vice as the greate&s;t, and the mo&s;t degrading, of all evils; and the con&s;cientious di&s;charge of all moral duties, as e&s;&s;ential to their dignity and happine&s;s. And to this end, ha&s;ten, we be&s;eech thee, the time, when the Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall be univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed, and produce its full effect.</P>
<P>But, more e&s;pecially, we pray for the inhabi|tants of the&s;e United States. Continue to them the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, and good government. And, O gracious God, who "make&s;t men to be of one mind in a hou&s;e," a city, or even in a whole nation, heal their divi&s;ions; and di&s;po&s;e them to love one ano|ther, as becometh tho&s;e who are brethren, both by nature and grace,&mdash;and who have all one common intere&s;t, by being members of the &s;ame community.</P>
<P>At this hour of danger to our country, give wi&s;dom, give fortitude, and at the &s;ame time mo|deration,
<PB N="v" REF="031736_0004_0FEE25F26B675BD0">
to all tho&s;e whom we entru&s;t with the exerci&s;e of our &s;overeignty. More particularly, we be&s;eech thee to behold with thy favour the Pre|&s;ident of the United States. May his admini&s;tra|tion be happy and glorious:&mdash;grant him in health and pro&s;perity long to live; and finally, after this life, to obtain everla&s;ting felicity.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s all &s;chools and &s;eminaries of learning; that, by them, our youth may be trained up in the fear and love of thy holy name, and be qualified to do much good in their day and generation.</P>
<P>And, finally, we be&s;eech thee to ble&s;s the young men whom we are this day about to admit to the honours of this &s;eminary. Grant, that the in&s;truc|tions which have here been be&s;towed on them, may not be be&s;towed in vain; but that they may be the in&s;truments, in thy hands, of re&s;toring health to the &s;ick, and of bidding the heart, which pain or &s;ympathetic &s;orrow had dejected, &s;ing for joy.</P>
<P>Accept, mo&s;t merciful God, of the&s;e our peti|tions, which we offer in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord; who has taught us, when we pray, to &s;ay,</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="031736_0005_0FEE25F3F2BA1968">Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven: Give us, this day, our daily bread; and forgive us our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as we forgive tho&s;e who tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glo|ry, forever and ever.</P>

<HEAD>THE ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is natural to expect, that they who are entru&s;ted with the direction of &s;eminaries of learning, mu&s;t be &s;olicitous for the reputable conduct of tho&s;e upon whom the honours of &s;uch &s;eminaries are be&s;towed. Hence the cu&s;tom, which has always prevailed in this place, of tak|ing leave of our graduates, whether in medicine or in the arts, with a parting addre&s;s, or charge, re&s;pecting their conduct in future life; the words of tho&s;e whom we e&s;teem being apt to make a deeper and more la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion when &s;poken at that time, than at any other.</P>
<P>On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, this duty, owing to the indi&s;po&s;ition of our venerable provo&s;t, has devolved on me:&mdash;a circum&s;tance which I re|gret;&mdash;becau&s;e I have neither had &s;ufficient lei|&s;ure,
<PB N="10" REF="031736_0008_0FEE2605E410B250">
nor (had that been afforded me) &s;ufficient experience, to di&s;charge it properly. It is &s;ome con&s;olation, however, to reflect, that &s;uch is your own good &s;en&s;e, (which I have heard very high|ly &s;poken of;) and &s;uch the opportunities of in|formation which you have &s;o long enjoyed in this place, under the mo&s;t able in&s;tructors; as to ren|der the be&s;t things that could have been &s;aid at this time, in a great mea&s;ure unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>That no man is born for him&s;elf only, is a maxim which can never be di&s;puted. Every one, who is capable of the lea&s;t reflection, mu&s;t be con|vinced by daily experience, that, without the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance which he derives from the labours of others, his life mu&s;t be de&s;titute of comfort, if not of &s;upport. And if &s;o, can he rea&s;onably &s;up|po&s;e, that he alone is privileged to receive good, but without any obligation on his part to com|municate it; to partake in the general welfare, but to do nothing to promote it.</P>
<P>It follows, that it is every man's duty to avoid idlene&s;s, and to pur&s;ue &s;ome profe&s;&s;ion that is of u&s;e to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>This, Gentlemen, is what you appear to have propo&s;ed to your&s;elves. And the profe&s;&s;ion you
<PB N="11" REF="031736_0009_0FEE26076D397038">
have cho&s;en, is both honourable and u&s;eful. For if health be the fir&s;t of earthly ble&s;&s;ings, and it is generally allowed to be &s;o, then they who in&s;truct us how to pre&s;erve it, or re&s;tore it to us when lo&s;t, de&s;erve to be held in very high e&s;timation.</P>
<P>But, at the &s;ame time that we be&s;tow on the profe&s;&s;ion of medicine this tribute of ju&s;t prai&s;e, we do not he&s;itate to &s;ay, that as, on the one hand, we have much to hope from it, &s;o, on the other, we have &s;omething to fear. In the hands of the ignorant and illiterate, of men of weak judg|ment, and of all, who, either from nature or habit, are aver&s;e to &s;tudy and reflection, it is pro|ductive of the mo&s;t fatal evils. To &s;uch practi|tioners it is owing, that, to this day, it continues to be a matter of debate, whether the profe&s;&s;ion have, on the whole, done more good or harm to &s;ociety; and that, in almo&s;t all times, even great and highly e&s;timable per&s;ons have made it a &s;ub|ject of ridicule. Of this number, I need not in|form you, was Pliny, the naturali&s;t; who repeats an ancient in&s;cription upon a tomb, in which the decea&s;ed &s;aid, that he died of a multitude of phy|&s;icians, <HI>turba &s;e medicorum perii&s;&s;e.</HI> And &s;peak|ing of phy&s;ic, and of tho&s;e who practi&s;ed it in his day, "They learn it, &s;ays he, at our hazard, and acquire experience at the price of our lives.
<PB N="12" REF="031736_0010_0FEE2608F30AC1D8">
No law puni&s;hes their ignorance, nor is there any example of their being cha&s;ti&s;ed. Only a phy&s;i|cian can murder with ab&s;olute impunity." And, to come nearer to our own times, in this number was al&s;o Mr. Addi&s;on. "We may lay it down as a maxim, &s;ays this celebrated writer, that when a nation abounds in phy&s;icians, it grows thin of people. Sir William Temple," continues he, "is very much puzzled to find out a rea&s;on why the northern hive, as he calls it, does not &s;end out &s;uch prodigious &s;warms, and overrun the world with Goths and Vandals, as it did former|ly; but had this excellent author ob&s;erved, that there were no &s;tudents in phy&s;ick among the &s;ub|jects of Thor and Woden, and that this &s;cience very much flouri&s;hes in the North at pre&s;ent, he might have found a better &s;olution for this diffi|culty than any of tho&s;e he has made u&s;e of."</P>
<P>The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, which probably may have occurred to your&s;elves in the cour&s;e of your read|ing, are not here cited from the &s;ame motives with which they appear to have been written, but to impre&s;s you more &s;trongly with a &s;en&s;e of the arduou&s;ne&s;s of the undertaking in which you are about to engage; as well as with a convic|tion, that, without exerting your be&s;t endeavours to qualify your&s;elves to be u&s;eful, you may occa|&s;ionally
<PB N="13" REF="031736_0011_0FEE260D529216E0">
be in danger of producing the mo&s;t &s;eri|ous misfortunes.</P>
<P>Give me leave, therefore, to recommend to you, in the fir&s;t place, a diligent improvement of your lei&s;ure hours, in extending your reading, and acquiring farther and &s;till farther information.</P>
<P>They, who write on grandeur and &s;ublimity, are wont to tell us, that, though real greatne&s;s al|ways rai&s;es admiration, yet littlene&s;s does not ex|cite the contrary pa&s;&s;ion of contempt; except when we are di&s;appointed by it, and meet with it in a place where we had rea&s;on to expect &s;ome|thing better. The &s;ame remark, with but little variation, may be applied to the &s;ubject before us. Want of learning, in a pea&s;ant, or mechanick, ex|cites in us no &s;entiments of contempt. To their occupations learning is not e&s;&s;ential; and the poverty in which they are frequently educated, and the nece&s;&s;ity, at a more advanced period, of a con&s;tant application to manual labour, allow them no opportunity of acquiring it. But an il|literate phy&s;ician can never fail to be contempti|ble; becau&s;e his profe&s;&s;ion being a learned profe&s;|&s;ion, we expect to find in him a literary character, and are di&s;appointed when it is otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="031736_0012_0FEE26132B3AC9A8">As medicine, however the invention of it may be a&s;cribed to the Egyptians, was fir&s;t culti|vated as a &s;cience in Greece, and, in con&s;equence of this, mo&s;t of the terms that belong to it are of Greek derivation; as there are many valuable writings on the &s;ubject of medicine in that, and al&s;o in the Latin, language; and as a knowledge of the&s;e languages gives us a free acce&s;s to all the learning of antiquity, and to the mo&s;t fini&s;hed models of eloquence in every &s;pecies of compo&s;i|tion; it will be expected of a phy&s;ician, in com|mon with other men of learning, to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure acquainted with them. And as every phy&s;ician &s;hould be a writer,&mdash;&s;o far at lea&s;t as to be capable, when an occa&s;ion requires it, of com|municating his &s;entiments, by writing, with per&s;pi|cuity and correctne&s;s,&mdash;he &s;hould be well acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">int|ed with the elements of critici&s;m; or what<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er is comprehended under the terms, grammar, rhe|torick, and the belles lettres. He &s;hould be no &s;tranger to philo&s;ophy; e&s;pecially to that branch of it which is called phy&s;icks, or natural philo&s;o|phy. All the mo&s;t approved authors who have written on the &s;ubject of his profe&s;&s;ion, he &s;hould read, and continue to read, till every &s;entiment contained in them be not only comprehended, but rendered familiar to him, and indelibly impre&s;&s;ed on his memory. And, la&s;tly, he &s;hould cultivate
<PB N="15" REF="031736_0013_0FEE2616BB67DED8">
habits of &s;trict attention, in whatever it may be in which he happens to be engaged; but more par|ticularly in every occurrence which relates to his practice; that he may be qualified to profit by his own experience.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e branches, you have, we doubt not, made already a con&s;iderable proficiency; but it will require no &s;mall degree of application to keep up this proficiency, and to &s;upply what is wanting.</P>
<P>Secondly. We tru&s;t, that you will be no le&s;s diligent in the cultivation of every moral virtue.</P>
<P>And, under this head, we would particularly recommend to you to cheri&s;h Sympathy. No|thing is more odious in any man than that in&s;en|&s;ibility which wraps him up in him&s;elf, and pre|vents his being moved with either the joys or &s;or|rows of another. In a phy&s;ician, it is not to be borne with. His abilities may indeed command our re&s;pect; but it is this participation in our joys and &s;orrows, by which only he can render him|&s;elf beloved. And the phy&s;ician, who is beloved by his patients, will always have it in his power to do them the more good. His very pre&s;ence will &s;oothe their angui&s;h, and his looks and accents impart con&s;olation.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="031736_0014_0FEE261B45240E28">Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s is another of tho&s;e virtues, which may be here &s;pecified; as being peculiarly becoming in the character of a phy&s;ician. By di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, we do not mean, that, in gene|ral, you &s;hould have no expectation of being re|warded for your &s;ervices, or that your reward &s;hould not be liberal; but that, on all proper oc|ca&s;ions, you &s;hould be willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t and relieve your poorer brethren, in the way of your profe&s;|&s;ion as well as otherwi&s;e, hoping for no return; except that, which is indeed the greate&s;t of all others, the approbation of that Being who con|&s;iders every act of beneficence done to the mean|e&s;t of his creatures, as done to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>What is &s;aid by Hippocrates on this &s;ubject, is perhaps worthy of your attention: but, how far it is agreeable to the u&s;age of phy&s;icians, or might be attended with inconveniencies in prac|tice, I am unable to determine. He is for having the phy&s;ician to act, in re&s;pect to his fees, with ho|nour and humanity, and "regulate them by the patient's power to reward them more or le&s;s libe|rally." In the following &s;entiment, however, I am confident that you will agree with him. "There are even occa&s;ions," &s;ays he, "on which a phy&s;ician ought neither to a&s;k nor to expect re|ward; as in the ca&s;es of &s;trangers, and the poor, whom all the world are obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t."</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="031736_0015_0FEE261F2F290368">I will mention but one more of the&s;e virtues; and it is Candour: which I mention the rather, as the want of it in a phy&s;ician may, on certain occa&s;ions, produce incalculable evil.</P>
<P>Of this virtue, the author whom I have ju&s;t cited, who was as excellent a man as he was an illu&s;trious phy&s;ician, may &s;erve as an example. In his writings, he is not a&s;hamed to own, at the expen&s;e in &s;ome mea&s;ure of his glory, an error he had committed in dre&s;&s;ing a wound on the head; "le&s;t," as he ob&s;erves, "others after him, and by his example, &s;hould fall into the &s;ame error." Does not this do him more honour, than even all his great learning and capacity? "Little minds," &s;ays Cel&s;us, "and men of vulgar abili|ties do not act in this manner; but are much more careful of the &s;mall reputation they have; be|cau&s;e they can lo&s;e nothing without impoveri&s;h|ing them&s;elves. Only great geniu&s;es, con&s;cious to them&s;elves of the abundance which they otherwi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s are capable of &s;uch an acknow|ledgment, and of neglecting the little lo&s;&s;es that dimini&s;h nothing of their riches and opulence."</P>
<P>But, thirdly and la&s;tly, I &s;hould think my|&s;elf inexcu&s;able, were I not to recommend to you
<PB N="18" REF="031736_0016_0FEE2620B51D8CA8">
a daily attention to the cultivation of pious af|fections.</P>
<P>HE DOES NOT DESERVE THE NAME OF A RA|TIONAL CREATURE, AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT GIVES TO HIS NATURE ITS HIGHEST DIGNITY, WHO NEGLECTS TO KEEP UP A CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH THE GREAT AUTHOR OF HIS BEING. And, indeed, what exerci&s;e can be, in it&s;elf, more delightful, than to contemplate the perfections of that Being, who exi&s;ted from eternity, who created all things, and &s;upplieth all things living with plenteou&s;ne&s;s; to expre&s;s our gratitude to him for the benefits which we every moment receive from him; to lift up our hearts unto him who careth for the meane&s;t of his creatures, and pitieth them as a father pitieth his children, to conver&s;e with him by prayer, to lay all our wants before him, and to unburthen, as it were, the fulne&s;s of our &s;ouls in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that this communication will add nothing to your profe&s;&s;ional &s;kill; nor can I venture to a&s;&s;ure you, that it will give any effica|cy to the medicines which you pre&s;cribe. But believing, as I do, that religious principle is e&s;&s;en|tial to the happine&s;s of individuals, and to the
<PB N="19" REF="031736_0017_0FEE2628E4DAD850">
very exi&s;tence of &s;ociety, I look upon per&s;ons, who are any way di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;tations which they hold in &s;ociety, to be more particular|ly bound to cheri&s;h it in them&s;elves, and (as far, at lea&s;t, as their <HI>example</HI> can go) to propagate it in others.</P>
<P>Finally, my brethren, the connection, which for &s;ome time pa&s;t has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us, mu&s;t henceforth cea&s;e. But the time, I tru&s;t, will ne|ver come, when you will cea&s;e, to reflect on that connection with plea&s;ure. On the other hand, I may venture to a&s;&s;ure you, that the good wi&s;hes of your former in&s;tructors will never fail to ac|company you. And in their name, as well as in my own, I bid you&mdash;FAREWELL.</P>
