<Q><HI>Be not drunk with Wine, wherein is Exce&s;s; but be filled with the Spirit.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Per&s;ons to whom the&s;e Words were writ|ten, were the People of <HI>Ephe&s;us;</HI> who being, as we are told in the <HI>Acts,</HI> Wor&s;hippers of the great Godde&s;s <HI>Diana,</HI> in all Probability wor&s;hipped the God <HI>Bacchus</HI> al&s;o: at the Celebration of who&s;e Fe|&s;tivals, it was always cu&s;tomary, nay, Part of their Religion, to get drunk; as though there was no o|ther Way to plea&s;e their God, but by turning them|&s;elves into Brutes.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle therefore, in this Chapter, among&s;t many other precepts more e&s;pecially applicable to them, lays down that in the Text; and exhorts them, as they had now, by the free Grace of God, been turned from heatheni&s;h Darkne&s;s to the Light of the Go&s;pel, to walk as Children of Light, and no longer make it Part of their Religion or Practice to be drunk with Wine, wherein is Exce&s;s; but, on the contrary, &s;trive to be filled with the Spirit of that Saviour, after who&s;e Name they were now cal|led, and who&s;e Religion taught them to ab&s;tain from &s;uch a filthy Sin, and to live &s;oberly as they ought to live.</P>
<P>By the World being now Chri&s;tian, and the Doc|trines of the Go&s;pel every where received, one would imagine, there &s;hould be no Rea&s;on for re|peating the Precepts now before us. But alas, Chri&s;tians! I mean Chri&s;tians fal&s;ly &s;o called, are &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed captive by all Sin in General, and by this of
<PB N="4" REF="004640_0003_100DB5DCE656ED18">
Drunkenne&s;s in particular, that was <HI>St. Paul</HI> to ri&s;e again from the dead, he might be tempted to think mo&s;t of us were turned back to the Wor&s;hip of dumb Idols; that we had &s;et up Temples in Honour of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">; it Part of our Religion, as the <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> did of theirs, <HI>to be drunk with Wine, wherein is Exce&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Our civil Magi&s;trates have not been wanting to u&s;e the Power given them from above for the Puni&s;h|ment and Re&s;traint of &s;uch evil Doings; and I wi&s;h it could be &s;aid this Plague of Drinking, by what they have done, had been &s;tayed among&s;t us. But alas! though their Labour, we tru&s;t, has not been altogether in vain in the Lord, yet thou&s;ands, and I could almo&s;t &s;ay, ten thou&s;ands fall daily at our Right Hand, by this Sin of Drunkenne&s;s, in our Streets; nay, Men &s;eem to have made a Covenant with Hell, and though the Power of the civil Magi&s;trate is ex|erted again&s;t them; nay, and though they cannot but daily &s;ee the Companions of their Riot hourly by this, brought to the Grave, yet they <HI>will ri&s;e up early to follow &s;trong Drink, and cry, To Morrow &s;hall be as to Day, and &s;o much the more abundantly; when we awake, we will &s;eek it yet again.</HI></P>
<P>It is high Time therefore, for thy Mini&s;ters to life up their Voices like a Trumpet, and &s;ince human Threats cannot prevail, to &s;et before them the Ter|rors of the Lord, and try if the&s;e will not per&s;uade them to cea&s;e from the Evil of their Doings.</P>
<P>But alas! how &s;hall I addre&s;s my &s;elf to them? I fear Exce&s;s of Drinking has made them &s;uch meer <HI>Nabals,</HI> that there is no &s;peaking to them. And ma|ny of God's Servants have toiled all their Lifetimes in di&s;&s;uading them from this Sin of Drunkenne&s;s, yet they will not forbear. However, at his Com|mand,
<PB N="5" REF="004640_0003_100DB5DCE656ED18">
I will &s;peak al&s;o, though they be a rebellious Hou&s;e. Magnify thy Strength, O Lord, in my Weakne&s;s, and grant that I may &s;peak with &s;uch Demon&s;tration of the Spirit, and with Power, that from henceforward they may cea&s;e to act &s;o unwi&s;ely, and this Sin of Drunkenne&s;s may not be their Ruin.</P>
<P>Believe me, ye unhappy Men of <HI>Belial</HI> (for &s;uch, alas! this Sin has made you) it is not without the &s;tronge&s;t Rea&s;ons, as well as utmo&s;t Concern for your precious and immortal Souls, that I now conjure you, in the Apo&s;tles Words, <HI>Not to be drunk with Wine, or any other Liquor, wherein is Exce&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>For, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Drunkenne&s;s is a Sin which mu&s;t be highly di&s;plea&s;ing to God; becau&s;e it is an Abu&s;e of his good Creatures.</P>
<P>When God fir&s;t made Man, and had breathed into him the breath of Life, he gave him Dominion over the Works of his Hands, and every Herb bearing Seed, and every Tree, in which was the Fruit of a Tree yielding Seed, to him it was given for Meat; but when <HI>Adam</HI> had ta&s;ted the forbidden Fruit, which was the only Re&s;traint laid upon him, he forfeited this Priviledge, and had no Right, &s;ince he had di&s;obeyed his Creator, to the U&s;e of any one of the Creatures.</P>
<P>But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, this Charter, as well as all other Priviledges, is re&s;tored to us by the Death of the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> our Lord and Ma&s;ter <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Of every Bea&s;t of the Field, every Fi&s;h of the Sea, and what&s;oever flieth in the Air, or moveth on the Face of the Earth, that is fit for Food, we may free|ly eat, <HI>i. e.</HI> without Scruple take, and eat; but then, with this Limitation, that we u&s;e them moderately. For God, by the Death of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> has given no Man
<PB N="6" REF="004640_0004_100DB5DEA64178E8">
Licen&s;e to be intemperate; but, on the contrary, has laid us under the &s;tronge&s;t Obligations to live &s;oberly, as well as godly, in this pre&s;ent World.</P>
<P>But the Drunkard, de&s;pi&s;ing the Goodne&s;s and Bounty of God, in re&s;toring to us what we had &s;o ju&s;tly forfeited, turns his Grace into Wantonne&s;s; and as though the Creature was not of it&s;elf enough &s;ubject to Vanity, by being Cur&s;ed for our Sakes, he abu&s;es it &s;till more, by making it admini&s;ter to his Lu&s;ts; and turns that Wine which was intended to make glad his Heart, into a deadly Poi&s;on.</P>
<P>But thinke&s;t thou, O Drunkard, who&s;oever thou art, thou &s;halt e&s;cape the righteous Judgment of God? No, the Time will &s;hortly come that thou mu&s;t be no longer Steward, and then the &s;overeign Lord of all the Earth will reckon with thee for thus wa&s;ting his Goods. Alas! wilt thou then wre&s;t Scripture any longer to thy own Damnation? And becau&s;e <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> turned Water into Wine at the Marriage Fea&s;t, to &s;upply the Wants of his indigent Ho&s;t, &s;ay, that it is therefore meet to make merry, and be drunken. No, thou &s;halt be &s;ilent before him; and know, that tho' thou ha&s;t encouraged thy|&s;elf in Drunkenne&s;s by &s;uch like Arguments, yet for all the&s;e Things God will bring thee into Judgment.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> What makes Drunkenne&s;s more ex|ceeding &s;inful, is, that a Man, by falling into it, &s;in|neth again&s;t his own Body!</P>
<P>When the Apo&s;tle would di&s;&s;uade the <HI>Corinthians</HI> from Fornication, he urges this as an Argument, <HI>Flee Fornication,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Brethren; for he that com|mitteth Fornication, &s;inneth again&s;t his own Body.</HI> And may not I as ju&s;tly cry out, Flee Drunkenne&s;s, my Brethren, &s;ince he that committeth that Crime,
<PB N="7" REF="004640_0004_100DB5DEA64178E8">
&s;inneth again&s;t his own Body? For, from whence come &s;o many Di&s;ea&s;es and Di&s;tempers in you Bo|dies: Come they not from hence, even from your Intemperance in drinking? Who hath Pains in the Head? Who hath Rottenne&s;s in the Bones? Who hath Redne&s;s of Eyes? He that tarries long at the Wine, he that ri&s;es early to &s;eek new Wine. How many walking Skeletons have you &s;een, who&s;e Bodies were once exceeding fair to look upon, fat, and well favoured; but, by this Sin of drinking, how has their Beauty departed from them, and how have they been permitted to walk to and fro upon the Earth, as though God intended to &s;et them up, as he did <HI>Lot'</HI>s Wife, for Monuments of his Ju&s;tice, that others might learn not to get drunk? Nay I appeal to your&s;elves. Are not many, for this Cau&s;e, even now &s;ickly among you? And have not many of your Companions whom you once &s;aw flouri&s;hing, like green Bay Trees, been brought by it, with Sorrow, to their Graves?</P>
<P>We might perhaps, think our&s;elves hardly dealt with by God, was he to &s;end to us, as he did to the royal P&s;almi&s;t, to choo&s;e one Plague out of three, whereby we &s;hould be de&s;troyed. But had the Almighty decreed to cut off Man from the Face of the Earth, and to &s;horten his Days, he could not well &s;end a more effectual Plague than to per|mit Men, as they plea&s;ed, to overcharge them&s;elves with Drunkenne&s;s; for though it be a &s;low, vet it is a certain Poi&s;on. And if the Sword has &s;lain its thou&s;ands, Drunkenne&s;s has &s;lain its ten thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>And will not this alarm you, O ye Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors? Will not this per&s;uade you to &s;pare your&s;elves, and to do your Bodies no Harm? What, have you lo&s;t the fir&s;t Principles of human Nature, the fundamen|tal
<PB N="8" REF="004640_0005_100DB5E319FCCD30">
Law of Self-pre&s;ervation? You &s;eem to have a great Fondne&s;s for your Bodies, why otherwi&s;e to gratify their inordinate Appetites, do you drink to Exce&s;s? But &s;urely, if you truly loved them, you would not thus de&s;troy them; and was there no other Argument to be urged again&s;t Drunkenne&s;s, the Con|&s;ideration that it will de&s;troy tho&s;e Lives you are &s;o fond of, one would imagine, &s;hould be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>I know, indeed, that it is a common An&s;wer that Dru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">kards make to tho&s;e, who, out of Love, would pull them as Firebrands out of the Fire "We are no Body's Enemy but our own." But this, in|&s;tead of being an excu&s;e for, is but an Aggravation of their Guilt: For (not to mention that the Drun|kenne&s;s of one Man has c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">athed many a Family with Rags, and that it is &s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ace po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ble for a Per&s;on to be drunk, without t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">pting his Neighbour al&s;o) I &s;ay, not to mention the&s;e, and many other ill Con|&s;equences, which would prove &s;uch an Excu&s;e to be entirely fal&s;e; yet what is dearer to a Man than him|&s;elf? And if he him&s;elf be lo&s;t, what would all the whole World avail him? But how wilt thou &s;tand. O Man, before the Judgment-Seat of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and make &s;uch an Excu&s;e, when thou &s;halt be arraigned before him as a Self-Murderer? Will it then be &s;uf|ficient, thinke&s;t thou, to &s;ay, <HI>I was no Man's Enemy but my own?</HI> No; God will then tell thee, that thou wa&s;t not thy own; that thou wa&s;t bought with the Price of his dear Son's Blood, and thou oughte&s;t therefore to have glorified him with thy Spirit, and with thy Body, which were his. And &s;ince thou ha&s;t, by Intemperance, de&s;troyed thy Body, he will de&s;troy both thy Body and Soul in Hell.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004640_0005_100DB5E319FCCD30">
But, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> What renders Drunkenne&s;s more inexcu&s;ible, is, that it robs a Man of his Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on is the Glory of a Man; the chief Thing whereby God has made us to differ from the Brute Creation. And our modern Unbelievers have exalt|ed it to &s;uch a high Degree, as even to &s;et it in Op|po&s;ition to Revelation, and deny the Lord that bought them. But though in doing this, they great|ly err, and whil&s;t they profe&s;s them&s;elves wi&s;e, be|come real Fools; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et we mu&s;t acknowledge, that Rea&s;on is the Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e of the Lord, and who&s;oever puts it out, &s;hall bear his Puni&s;hment, who&s;oever he be.</P>
<P>But yet, this the Drunkard does. <HI>Nebuchadnez|zar'</HI>s Cur&s;e he makes his Choice, his Rea&s;on depar|teth from him; and then what is he better than a Brute?</P>
<P>The very Heathen Kings were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, that, in order to deter their young Princes from drinking, they u&s;ed to make their Slaves get drunk, and be expo&s;ed before them. And did&s;t thou but &s;ee thine own Picture, O Drunkard, when, after having drowned thy Rea&s;on, thou &s;taggere&s;t to and fro, like one of the Fools in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;ee&s;t thy very Companions making Songs upon thee, &s;urely thou would&s;t not return to thy Vomit again, but ab|hor thy&s;elf in Du&s;t and A&s;hes?</P>
<P>When <HI>David,</HI> in a holy Extacy, was dancing be|fore the Ark, <HI>Mich<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, Saul'</HI>s Daughter, de&s;pi&s;eth him in her Heart; and when he came home, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>How glorious was the King of I&s;rael to Day, who uncovered him&s;elf to Day in the Eyes of the Handmaids of his Servants, as one of the vain Fel|lows &s;hamele&s;ly uncovereth him&s;elf.</HI> And may not every one that meets a Drunkard, more ju&s;tly &s;ay,<HI><PB N="10" REF="004640_0006_100DB5E4B25FEB78">
How glorious does he, that was made a little lower than the Angels, look to Day, when unmindful of his Dignity, he has, by drinking, robbed him&s;elf of his Rea&s;on, and reduced him&s;elf to a Level with the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>But what if God, in the mid&s;t of one of the&s;e drunken Fits, &s;hould arre&s;t thee by Death, and &s;ay unto thee <HI>Thou Fool, this Moment &s;hall thy Soul be required of thee.</HI> Oh! How would&s;t thou appear in tho&s;e filthy Garments before that God, in who&s;e Sight the Heavens are not clean. And how know|e&s;t thou, O Man, but this may be thy Lot? Ha&s;t thou not known many, in thy Life-time, &s;ummoned at &s;uch an unguarded Hour; and what A&s;&s;urance ha&s;t thou given thee, that thou &s;halt not be the next? Becau&s;e God has forborn thee &s;o long, think|e&s;t thou he will forbear always? No, this is rather a Sign that he will come at an Hour thou looke&s;t not for him; and &s;ince his Goodne&s;s and Long-Suffering has not led thee to Repentance, he will cut thee down, and not permit thee to cumber the Ground any longer. Con&s;ider this then, all ye that count it a Plea&s;ure to turn your&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Brutes, le&s;t God pluck you away by a &s;udden Death and there be none to deliver you.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Fourthly,</HI> There is a farther Aggravation of this Crime, that it is an Inlet to, and Forerun|ner of many other Sins; for it &s;eldom comes alone.</P>
<P>We may &s;ay of Drunkenne&s;s, as <HI>Solomon</HI> does of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, that it is like the letting out of Water; for we know not what will be the End thereof. Its Name is <HI>Legion;</HI> For behold a Troop of Sins cometh after it. And for my own Part, when I &s;ee a Drun|kard, I can &s;carce, with the holy Prophet, when he
<PB N="11" REF="004640_0006_100DB5E4B25FEB78">
looked in <HI>Hazael'</HI>s Face, forbear weeping, to con|&s;ider how many Vices he may fall into, ere he comes to him&s;elf again.</P>
<P>What horrid Ince&s;t did righteous <HI>Let</HI> commit with his own Daughters when they had made him drunk? And, I doubt not, but there are many among&s;t you, who have committed &s;uch Crimes when you have deprived your&s;elves of your Rea&s;on by drinking; that were you to hear of them, your Heart, like <HI>Nabal'</HI>s, after he was told how he had abu&s;ed <HI>David</HI> when he was drunk, would die within you. And had any one told you, when you were &s;ober, hat you would have been guilty of &s;uch Crimes, you would have cried out, with <HI>Hazael</HI> before mention|ed, <HI>Are thy Servants &s;o many Dogs, that they &s;hould do thus?</HI></P>
<P>But no marvel that Drunkards commit &s;uch Crimes: For Drunkenne&s;s drives the Holy Spirit from them; they become meer Machines for the Devil to work up to what he plea&s;es; he enters into them, as he entered into the Herd of Swine; and no Wonder if they then commit all Uncleanne&s;s, and any other Crime, with Greedine&s;s. But this leads me to a</P>
<P><HI>Fifth</HI> Con&s;ideration, which highly aggravates the Sin of Drunkenne&s;s, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That it &s;eperates the holy Spirit from us.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped, that no one here pre&s;ent need be informed, that before we can be Chri&s;tians indeed, we mu&s;t receive the Holy Gho&s;t, mu&s;t be born again from above, and have the Spirit of God witne&s;&s;ing with our Spirits, that we are the Sons of God. This, this alone is true Chri&s;tianity; and without the Cohabitation of this Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit in our Hearts,
<PB N="12" REF="004640_0007_100DB5E6796CB6D0">
our Righteou&s;ne&s;s does not exceed the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Scri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> and we &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P>But now, Drunkards do, in Effect, bid this Ble&s;|&s;ed Spirit depart from them: For what has he to do with &s;uch filthy Swine? No, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no Lot or Share in the Spirit of the Son of <HI>David.</HI> They have cha&s;ed him our of their Hearts, by defiling his Temple; I mean their Bodies. And he can no more hold Communion with them, than Light can have Communion with Darkne&s;s, or <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> have Concord with <HI>Belial.</HI></P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle therefore, in the Words of the Text, exorts the <HI>Ephe&s;ians, not to be drunk with Wine, wherein is Exce&s;s, but to be filled with the Spirit;</HI> thereby implying&punc; that Drunkenne&s;s and the Spirit of God could never dwell in the &s;ame Heart. And in another Epi&s;tle, he bids them <HI>avoid unprofitable Conver&s;ation, as a Thing which grieved the Holy Spirit; whereby alone they could be &s;ealed to the Day of Redemptions.</HI> And if unprofitable Conver&s;ation grieves the Holy Spirit, at what an infinite Di&s;tance mu&s;t Drunkenne&s;s drive him from the Hearts of Men?</P>
<P>But oh that you were wi&s;e! That you would con|&s;ider what a dreadful Thing it is to have the Spirit of the living God depart from you: For, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves, if you live without him, you live with|out God in the World. You are in the &s;ame mi&s;er|able forlorn Condition as <HI>Saul</HI> was, when an evil Spirit of the Lord came upon him; and you are only &s;o many Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath fitted for Di&s;truction. But this brings me to the</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004640_0007_100DB5E6796CB6D0">
<HI>Sixth</HI> and la&s;t Rea&s;on I &s;hall urge again&s;t the Sin of Drunkenne&s;s, that it ab&s;olutely unfits a Man for the Enjoyment of God in Heaven, and expo&s;es him to his Eternal Wrath.</P>
<P>To &s;ee and enjoy God, and to be like the ble&s;&s;ed Angels, always beholding the Face of our Heavenly Father, in the Glories of his Kingdom, is &s;uch an un&s;peakable Happine&s;s, that even wicked Men, though they will not live the Life of the Righteous, cannot but wi&s;h their future State to be like his.</P>
<P>But think you, O ye Drunkards, that you &s;hall ever be Partakers of this Inheritance with the Saints in Light? Do you flatter your&s;elves, that you, who have made them often the Subject of your drunken Songs, &s;hall now be exalted to &s;ing with them the Heavenly Songs of <HI>Sion?</HI> No, as by Drunkenne&s;s you have made your Hearts Cages of unclean Birds, with impure and unclean Spirits mu&s;t you dwell.</P>
<P>A burning <HI>Tophet,</HI> kindled by God's Wrath, is prepared for your Reception, where you mu&s;t &s;uffer the Vengeance of an eternal Fire, and in vain cry out for a Drop of Water to cool your Tongues. In|deed you &s;hall drink, but it &s;hall be a Cup of God's Fury: For in the Hand of the Lord, there will be a Cup of Fury, it will be full mixed; and as for the Dregs thereof, all the Drunkards of the Land &s;hall &s;uck them out.</P>
<P>But perhaps you may not believe this Report. The&s;e Words may be looked upon by you as idle Tales, and I may &s;eem to you as <HI>Lot</HI> did to his Sons-in-Law, when he came to warn them to get up out of <HI>Sodom,</HI> as one that mocketh. But if you be|lieve not me, believe eternal Truth it&s;elf, and he has po&s;&s;itively declared, that no Drunkard &s;hall ever enter into his Kingdom.</P>

<P>Behold then I have told you before&punc; remember you this Day were informed what the End of Drun|kenne&s;s would be. And I &s;ummon you, in the Name of that God whom I &s;erve, to meet me at the Judgment-Seat of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that you may acquit both my Ma&s;ter and me; and confe&s;s, with your own Mouths, that your Damnation was of your|&s;elves, and that we were freed from the Blood of you all.</P>
<P>But, Lord, has no one believed our Report? Wilt thou &s;uffer &s;o many Words to be &s;poken in vain, if it be yet in vain? No, methinks I &s;ee &s;ome prick|ed to the Heart, and ready to cry out in the Lan|guage of <HI>David</HI> to <HI>Abigail, Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> which &s;ent thee this Day to &s;peak unto us. For &s;urely, unle&s;s he had &s;ent thee, this Sin of Drunkenne&s;s had been our Ruin.</HI> But, now, &s;ince we find whither it will lead us, we are re&s;olved to drink no Liquor to Exce&s;s while the World &s;tands, le&s;t we &s;hould be tormented in the Flames of Hell.</P>
<P>But alas! how &s;hall we be delivered from the Power of this Sin? Can the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? So hard, almo&s;t, will it be for us who have been accu&s;tomed to be in|temperate, to learn to live &s;ober.</P>
<P>But do not de&s;pair; for what is impo&s;&s;ible with Man, is po&s;&s;ible with God. Or whom then &s;hould you &s;eek for Succour, but of him your Lord? Who,

though for this Sin of Drunkenne&s;s, he might ju&s;tly turn away his Face from you; yet if you pour out your Hearts before him in daily Prayer, and ask A&s;&s;i&s;tance from above, he will endue you with Power from on high, and make you more than Conquerors through <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> that loved you. Had you kept up Communion with him in Prayer, you would not &s;o long, by Drunkenne&s;s, have had Communion with Devils. And had you be&s;ought him in&s;tantly, that you might not be led into Temptation, you would always have been delivered from the Evil of it. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Prodigal, you have de&s;ired to be your own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; you have lived without Prayer, depended on your own Strength; and &s;ee, alas! on what a broken Reed you have leaned. How &s;oon have you made your&s;elves like the Bea&s;ts that have no Under&s;tanding? <HI>But turn ye, turn ye from your evil Ways.</HI> Come to him, with the repenting Pro|digal, &s;aying, <HI>Father we have &s;inned, we be&s;eech thee, let not this Sin of Drunkenne&s;s have any longer Do|minion over us.</HI> And lo! it &s;hall happen to you even as you will.</P>
<P>But think not that God mu&s;t do all, and you no|thing. No; as we <HI>can</HI> do nothing without him, &s;o he <HI>will</HI> do nothing without us. And if we pray that we may not be led into Temptation, we mu&s;t take heed not to throw our&s;elves into it.</P>
<P>A <HI>Second</HI> Means therefore I would recommend to you, in order to get the better of Drunkenne&s;s, is to avoid evil Company. For it is the evil Commu|nications of wicked Men, that has drawn &s;o many thou&s;ands into this Sin, and &s;o corrupted their good Manners.</P>
<P>But you may &s;ay, <HI>If I leave my Companions, I
<PB N="16" REF="004640_0009_100DB5EB1AC7DD90">
mu&s;t expect Contempt: For they will certainly de&s;pi&s;e me for being &s;ingular,</HI> And thinke&s;t thou, O Man, ever to enter in at the &s;trait Gate by a true Con|ver&s;ion, without being had in Deri&s;ion of them that are round about thee? No; though thou may&s;t be de&s;pi&s;ed, and not go to Heaven, yet thou can&s;t not go to Heaven, without being de&s;pi&s;ed: For the Friend&s;hip of the World is Enmity with God. And they that are born after the Fle&s;h, will per&s;ecute tho&s;e that are born after the Spirit. Let not, there|fore, a &s;ervile Fear of being de&s;pi&s;ed by a Man that &s;hall die, hinder thy turning unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> God. For what is a little Contempt? It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Vapour which vani&s;heth away, and cometh not again. Bet|ter be derided by a few Companions here, than be made a&s;hamed before Men and Angels hereafter.

Yet a little while, and they them&s;elves &s;hall prai&s;e thy Do|ings, and &s;hall &s;ay, <HI>We, fools, counted his leaving us to be Folly, and his End to be without Honour: But how is he numbered among the Sons of God, and his Lot among the Saints!</HI></P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to lay down a <HI>Third</HI> Means for tho&s;e who would overcome this Sin of Drunkenne&s;s,&mdash;to enter upon a Life of &s;trict Self-denial and Mortifica|tion: For this Kind of Sin goeth not forth but by Prayer and Fa&s;ting. It is true, this may &s;eem a difficult Task; but then, we mu&s;t thank our&s;elves for it; For had we begun &s;ooner, our Work would have been the ea&s;ier. And even now, if you will but &s;trive, the Yoke of Mortification will grow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ighter and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ighter every Day.</P>

And here, by way of Conclu&s;ion to this Di&s;cour&s;e, I cannot but exhort all Per&s;ons, high and low, rich and poor, one with another, to practice a &s;trict Self-denial in eating and drinking. For though the Kingdom of God con&s;i&s;ts not in Meats and Drinks, yet an ab&s;temious U&s;e of, and a frequent total Ab&s;ti|nence from God's good Creatures, are great Promo|ters of the &s;piritual Life. And perhaps there are more de&s;troyed by living in a regular Sen&s;uality, than even by that very Sin I have now been warn|ing you of.&mdash;I know, indeed, that many, who are only almo&s;t Chri&s;tians, and who &s;eek, but do not &s;trive to enter into the Kingdom of God, urge a Text of Scripture to ju&s;tify their Indulgence, &s;aying, <HI>That it is not what entreth into the Man defileth the Man.</HI> And &s;o we grant, when taken moderately; but then they &s;hould con&s;ider, that it is po&s;&s;ible, nay, it is proved by daily Experience, that a Per&s;on may eat and drink &s;o much as not to hurt his Body, and yet do infinite Prejudice to his Soul. For Self-indul|gence lulls the Soul into a &s;piritual Slumber, as well as direct Intemperance; and though the latter may expo&s;e us to more Contempt among Men, yet the former, if continued in, will as certainly &s;hut us out from the Pre&s;ence of God. St. <HI>Paul</HI> knew this full well; and therefore, tho' he was the &s;piritual Father of thou&s;ands, and was near upon fini&s;hing his Cour&s;e, yet he &s;ays, it was his daily Practice to keep his Body under, and bring it into Subjection, no doubt, by a &s;trict Ab&s;tinence and Fa&s;ting; not that he might arrive at higher Degrees of Perfecti|on, but le&s;t after he had preached to others, he him|&s;elf &s;hould be a Ca&s;t-away. But why urge I the Apo&s;tle's Example to excite you to a &s;trict Tempe|rance in eating and drinking? Rather let me exhort
<PB N="18" REF="004640_0010_100DB5ECD0EE1B40">
you only to put in Practice the latter Part of the Text, <HI>to labour to be filled with the Spirit of God,</HI> and then you will no longer &s;earch the Scriptures to find Arguments for Self-Indulgence; but you will deal &s;incerely with your&s;elves, and fa&s;t as often as the Church enjoyns, if your Healths will permit; and eat and drink no more at any Time, than what is con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tricte&s;t Precepts of the Go&s;pel. Oh do but beg of God, that you may &s;ee how you are fallen in <HI>Adam,</HI> and mu&s;t be re|newed ere you can be happy, by the Spirit of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t!</HI> Let us be&s;eech him to enlighten us, to &s;ee the Treachery of our corrupt Hearts, and how pure and holy the&s;e Bodies ought to be, which are living Temples of the Holy Gho&s;t, and then we &s;hall &s;hew our&s;elves Men. Ab&s;tain from all Appearance of any thing that will quench this holy Spirit, and do any Thing that will invite him into, or cau&s;e him to abide in our Hearts. And thus being made Temples of the Holy Gho&s;t, by his dwelling in our Bodies here, though, after Death, Worms may de|&s;troy them; yet &s;hall they be rai&s;ed by the &s;ame Spirit at the general Re&s;urrection of the la&s;t Day, to be fa&s;hioned like unto <HI>Chri&s;t'</HI>s glorious Body hereafter.</P>
