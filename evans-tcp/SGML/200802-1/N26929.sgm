<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MANY &s;elections of excellent matter have lately been made for the benefit of young per&s;ons. Per|formances of this kind are of &s;o great utility, that fre&s;h productions of them, and new attempts to improve the young mind, will &s;carcely be deemed &s;uperfluous, if the writer make his compilation in&s;tructive and in|tere&s;ting, and &s;ufficiently di&s;tinct from others.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent work, as the title expre&s;&s;es, aims at the attainment of three objects: to improve youth in the art of reading; to meliorate their language and &s;entiments; and to inculcate &s;ome of the mo&s;t im|portant principles of piety and virtue.</P>
<P>THE pieces &s;elected, not only give exerci&s;e to a great variety of emotions, and the corre&s;pondent tones and variations of voice, but contain &s;entences and members of &s;entences, which are diver&s;ified, propor|tioned, and pointed with accuracy. Exerci&s;es of this nature are, it is pre&s;umed, well calculated to teach youth to read with propriety and effect. A &s;election of &s;entences, in which variety and proportion, with exact punctuation, have been carefully, ob&s;erved, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all their parts as well as with re&s;pect to one another, will probably have a much greater effect, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> properly teaching the art of reading, than is commonly imagined.
<PB N="iv" REF="035851_0005_1007AA452AA655C0">
In &s;uch con&s;tructions, every thing is accommodated to the under&s;tanding and the voice; and the common dif|ficulties in learning to read well, are obviated. When the learner has acquired a habit of reading &s;uch &s;en|tences, with ju&s;tne&s;s and facility, he will readily ap|ply that habit, and the improvements he has made, to &s;entences more complicated and irregular, and of a con&s;truction entirely different.</P>
<P>THE language of the pieces cho&s;en for this collec|tion, has been carefully regarded. Purity, propriety, per&s;picuity, and, in many in&s;tances, elegance of diction, di&s;tingui&s;h them. They are extracted from the works of the mo&s;t correct and elegant writers. From the &s;ources whence the &s;entiments are drawn, the reader may expect to find them connected and regular, &s;uffi|ciently important and impre&s;&s;ive, and dive&s;ted of every thing that is either trite or eccentric. The frequent peru&s;al of &s;uch compo&s;ition, naturally tends to infu&s;e a ta&s;te for this &s;pecies of excellence; and to produce a habit of thinking, and of compo&s;ing, with judgment and accuracy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Grammatical Student, in his progre&s;s through this work, will meet with numerous in&s;tances of compo&s;ition, in &s;trict conformity to the rules for promoting per&s;picuous and elegant writing, contain|ed in the Appendix to the Author's Engli&s;h Grammar. By occa|&s;ionally examining this conformity, he will be confirmed in the utility of tho&s;e rules; and be enabled to apply them with ca&s;e and dexterity.</NOTE></P>
<P>THAT this collection may al&s;o &s;erve the purpo&s;e of promoting piety and virtue, the Compiler has intro|duced many extracts, which place religion in the mo&s;t amiable light; and which recommend a great variety
<PB N="v" REF="035851_0006_1007AA47AD09C518">
of moral duties, by the excellence of their nature, and the happy effects which they produce. The&s;e &s;ubjects are exhibited in a &s;tyle and manner, which are calcu|lated to arre&s;t the attention of youth; and to make &s;trong and durable impre&s;&s;ions on their minds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome of the pieces, the Compiler has made a few alterations, chiefly verbal, to adapt them the better to the de&s;ign of his work.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Compiler has been careful to avoid every ex|pre&s;&s;ion and &s;entiment, that might gratify a corrupt mind, or, in the lea&s;t degree, offend the eye or ear of innocence. This he conceives to be peculiarly incum|bent on every per&s;on who writes for the benefit of youth. It would, indeed, be a great and happy im|provement in education, if no writings were allowed to come under their notice, but &s;uch as are perfectly innocent; and if, on all proper occa&s;ions, they were encouraged to peru&s;e tho&s;e which tend to in&s;pire a due reverence for virtue, and an abhorrence of vice, as well as to animate them with &s;entiments of piety and goodne&s;s. Such impre&s;&s;ions deeply engraven on their minds, and connected with all their attainments, could &s;carcely fail of attending them through life; and of producing a &s;olidity of principle and character, that would be able to re&s;i&s;t the danger ari&s;ing from future intercour&s;e with the world.</P>
<P>THE Author has endeavoured to relieve the grave and &s;erious parts of his collection, by the occa&s;ional admi&s;&s;ion of pieces which amu&s;e as well as in&s;truct. If, however, any of his readers &s;hould think it con|tains too great a proportion of the former, it may be
<PB N="vi" REF="035851_0007_1007AA4C1B8C7998">
&s;ome apology, to ob&s;erve that, in the exi&s;ting publica|tions de&s;igned for the peru&s;al of young per&s;ons, the preponderance is greatly on the &s;ide of gay and amu&s;ing productions. Too much attention may be paid to this medium of improvement. When the imagination, of youth e&s;pecially, is much entertained, the &s;ober dic|tates of the under&s;tanding are regarded with indif|ference; and the influence of the good affections, is either feeble, or tran&s;ient. A temperate u&s;e of &s;uch entertainment &s;eems therefore requi&s;ite, to afford pro|per &s;cope for the operations of the under&s;tanding and the heart.</P>
<P>THE reader will perceive, that the Compiler has been &s;olicitous to recommend to young per&s;ons, the peru&s;al of the &s;acred Scriptures, by inter&s;per&s;ing through his work, &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful and intere&s;ting pa&s;&s;ages of tho&s;e invaluable writings. To excite an early ta&s;te and veneration for this great rule of life, is a point of &s;o high importance, as to warrant the at|tempt to promote it on every proper occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>To improve the young mind, and to afford &s;ome a&s;|&s;i&s;tance to tutors, in the arduous and important work of education, were the motives which led to this pro|duction. If the Author &s;hould be &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as to ac|compli&s;h the&s;e ends, even in a &s;mall degree, he will think his time and pains well employed, and him&s;elf amply rewarded.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION. OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD READING.</HEAD>
<P>TO read with propriety is a plea&s;ing and important at|tainment; productive of improvement both to the under|&s;tanding and the heart. It is e&s;&s;ential to a complete reader, that he minutely perceive the ideas, and enter into the feelings, of the author who&s;e &s;entiments he profe&s;&s;es to re|peat; for how is it po&s;&s;ible to repre&s;ent clearly to others, what we have but faint or inaccurate conceptions of our|&s;elves? If there were no other benefits re&s;ulting from the art of reading well, than the nece&s;&s;ity it lays us under, of preci&s;ely a&s;certaining the meaning of what we read; and the habit thence acquired, of doing this with fa|cility, both when reading &s;ilently and aloud, they would con&s;titute a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for all the labour we can be&s;tow upon the &s;ubject. But the plea&s;ure derived to our&s;elves and others, from a clear communication of ideas and feelings; and the &s;trong and durable impre&s;&s;ions made thereby on the minds of the reader and the audience, are con&s;iderations, which give additional importance to the &s;tudy of this nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful art. The perfect attainment
<NOTE PLACE="foot">For many of the ob&s;ervations contained in this preliminary tract, the Author is indebted to the writings of Dr. Blair, and to the Encyclopaedia Britannica.</NOTE>
<PB N="viii" REF="035851_0009_1007AA5291C1B338">
of it doubtle&s;s requires great attention and practice, joined to extraordinary natural powers: but as there are many degrees of excellence in the art, the &s;tudent who&s;e aims fall &s;hort of perfection, will find him&s;elf amply rewarded for every exer|tion he may think proper to make.</P>
<P>To give rules for the management of the voice in reading, by which the nece&s;&s;ary pau&s;es, empha&s;is, and tones, may be di&s;covered and put in practice, is not po&s;&s;ible. After all the directions that can be offered on the&s;e points, much will remain to be taught by the living in&s;tructer: much will be attainable by no other means, than the force of example influencing the imitative powers of the learner. Some rules and principles on the&s;e heads will, however, be found u&s;e|ful, to prevent erroneous and vicious modes of utterance; to give the young reader &s;ome ta&s;te of the &s;ubject; and to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in acquiring a ju&s;t and accurate mode of delivery. The ob&s;ervations which we have to make, for the&s;e pur|po&s;es, may be compri&s;ed under the following heads: PROPER LOUDNESS OF VOICE; DISTINCTNESS; SLOWNESS; PRO|PRIETY OF PRONUNCIATION; EMPHASIS; TONES; PAUSES; and MODE OF READING VERSE.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION 1. Proper Loudne&s;s of Voice.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t attention of every per&s;on who reads to others, doubtle&s;s, mu&s;t be, to make him&s;elf be heard by all tho&s;e to whom he reads. He mu&s;t endeavour to fill with his voice the &s;pace occupied by the company. This power of voice, it may be thought, is wholly a natural talent. It is, in a good mea&s;ure, the gift of nature; but it may receive con|&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance from art. Much depends, for this pur|po&s;e, on the proper pitch and management of the voice.
<PB N="ix" REF="035851_0010_1007AA541BB48780">
Every per&s;on has three pitches in his voice; the HIGH, the MIDDLE, and the LOW one. The high, is that which he u&s;es in calling aloud to &s;ome per&s;on at a di&s;tance. The low is, when he approaches to a whi&s;per. The middle is, that which he employs in common conver&s;ation, and which he &s;hould generally u&s;e in reading to others. For it is a great mi&s;take, to imagine that one mu&s;t take the highe&s;t pitch of his voice, in order to be well heard in a large company. This is confounding two things which are different, loud|ne&s;s or &s;trength of &s;ound, with the key or note on which we &s;peak. There is a variety of &s;ound within the compa&s;s of each key. A &s;peaker may therefore render his voice louder, without altering the key: and we &s;hall always be able to give mo&s;t body, mo&s;t per&s;evering force of &s;ound, to that pitch of voice, to which in conver&s;ation we are accu&s;|tomed. Whereas, by &s;etting out on our highe&s;t pitch or key, we certainly allow our&s;elves le&s;s compa&s;s, and are likely to &s;train our voice before we have done. We &s;hall fatigue our&s;elves, and read with pain; and whenever a per|&s;on &s;peaks with pain to him&s;elf, he is always heard with pain by his audience. Let us therefore give the voice full &s;trength and &s;well of &s;ound; but always pitch it on our ordinary &s;peaking key. It &s;hould be a con&s;tant rule, never to utter a greater quantity of voice, than we can afford without pain to our&s;elves, and without any extraordinary effort. As long as we keep within the&s;e bounds, the oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> organs of &s;peech will be at liberty to di&s;charge their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> offices with ea&s;e; and we &s;hall always have our voice under command. But whenever we tran&s;gre&s;s the&s;e bounds, we give up the reins, and have no longer any management of it. It is a u&s;eful rule too, in order to be well heard, to fix our eye on &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tant per&s;ons in the company, and to con&s;ider our&s;elves as reading to them. We naturally and mechanically utter our words with &s;uch a degree of
<PB N="x" REF="035851_0011_1007AA5880DCCF58">
&s;trength, as to make our&s;elves be heard by the per&s;on whom we addre&s;s, provided he is within the reach of our voice. As this is the ca&s;e in conver&s;ation, it will hold al&s;o in reading to others. But let us remember, that in reading as well as in conver&s;ation, it is po&s;&s;ible to offend by &s;peak|ing too loud. This extreme hurts the car, by making the voice come upon it in rumbling indi&s;tinct ma&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>By the habit of reading, when young, in a loud and ve|hement manner, the voice becomes fixed in a &s;trained and unnatural key; and is rendered incapable of that variety of elevation and depre&s;&s;ion, which con&s;titutes the true har|mony of utterance, and affords ca&s;e to the reader, and plea|&s;ure to the audience. This unnatural pitch of the voice, and di&s;agreeable monotony, are mo&s;t ob&s;ervable in per&s;ons who were taught to read in large rooms; who were accu&s;|tomed to &s;tand at too great di&s;tance, when reading to their teachers; who&s;e in&s;tructers were very imperfect in their hear|ing; or who were taught by per&s;ons, that con&s;idered loud expre&s;&s;ion as the chief requi&s;ite in forming a good reader. The&s;e are circum&s;tances which demand the &s;erious atten|tion of every one to whom the education of youth is committed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II. Di&s;tinctne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>IN the next place, to being well heard and clearly under|&s;tood, di&s;tinctne&s;s of articulation contributes more than mere loudne&s;s of &s;ound. The quantity of &s;ound nece&s;&s;ary to fill even a large &s;pace, is &s;maller than is commonly imagined: and, with di&s;tinct articulation, a per&s;on with a weak voice will make it reach farther, than the &s;tronge&s;t voice can reach without it. To this, therefore, every reader ought to pay
<PB N="xi" REF="035851_0012_1007AA5B19FA5460">
great attention. He mu&s;t give every &s;ound which he utters, its due proportion; and make every &s;yllable, and even every letter in the word which he pronounces, be heard di&s;tinctly; without &s;lurring, whi&s;pering, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ing any of the proper &s;ounds.</P>
<P>An accurate knowledge of the &s;imple, elementary &s;ounds of the language, and a facility in expre&s;&s;ing them, are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tinctne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, that if the learner's attainments are, in this re&s;pect, imperfect, (and many there are in this &s;ituation,) it will be incumbent on his teacher, to carry him back to the&s;e primary articulations; and to &s;u&s;|pend his progre&s;s, till he become perfectly ma&s;ter of them. It will be in vain to pre&s;s him forward, with the hope of forming a good reader, if he cannot completely articulate every elementary &s;ound of the language.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III. Due Degree of Slowne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to expre&s;s our&s;elves di&s;tinctly, moderation is re|qui&s;ite with regard to the &s;peed of pronouncing. Precipi|tancy of &s;peech confounds all articulation, and all mean|ing. It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that there may be al&s;o an extreme on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. It is obvious that a lifele&s;s drawling manner of reading, which allows the minds of the hearers to be always outrunning the &s;peaker, mu&s;t render every &s;uch performance in&s;ipid and fatiguing. But the extreme of reading too fa&s;t is much more common; and requires the more to be guarded again&s;t, becau&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it has grown up into a habit, few errors are more difficu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> to be corrected. To pronounce with a proper degree of &s;lowne&s;s, and with full and clear articulation, is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;tudied by all, who wi&s;h to become good readers;
<PB N="xii" REF="035851_0013_1007912817AD7E30">
and it cannot be too much recommended to them. Such a pronunciation gives weight and dignity to the &s;ubject. It is a great a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the voice, by the pau&s;es and re&s;ts which it allows it more ea&s;ily to make; and it enables the reader to &s;well all his &s;ounds, both with more force and more harmony.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION IV. Propriety of Pronunciation.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the fundamental attentions to the pitch and ma|nagement of the voice, to di&s;tinct articulation, and to a pro|per degree of &s;lowne&s;s of &s;peech, what the young reader mu&s;t, in the next place, &s;tudy, is propriety of pronuncia|tion; or, giving to every word which he utters, that &s;ound which the be&s;t u&s;age of the language appropriates to it; in oppo&s;ition to broad, vulgar, or provincial pronunciation. This is requi&s;ite both for reading intelligibly, and for reading with correctne&s;s and ea&s;e. In&s;tructions concerning this ar|ticle may be&s;t be given by the living teacher. But there is one ob&s;ervation, which it may not be improper here to make. In the Engli&s;h language, every word which con&s;i&s;ts of more &s;yllables than one, has one accented &s;yllable. The accent re&s;ts &s;ometimes on the vowel, &s;ometimes on the con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ant. The genius of the language, requires the voice to mark that &s;yllable by a &s;tronger percu&s;&s;ion, and to pa&s;s more &s;lightly over the re&s;t. Now, after we have learned the pro|per &s;eats of the&s;e accents, it is an important rule, to give every word ju&s;t the &s;ame accent in reading as in common di&s;cour&s;e. Many per&s;ons err in this re&s;pect. When they read to others, and with &s;olemnity, they pronounce the &s;yllables in a different manner from what they do at other times. They dwell upon them, and protract them; they
<PB N="xiii" REF="035851_0014_1007AA5D74E69E28">
multiply accents on the &s;ame word; from a mi&s;taken no|tion, that it gives gravity and importance to their &s;ubject, and adds to the energy of their delivery. Whereas, this is one of the greate&s;t faults that can be committed in pronun|ciation: it makes what is called a pompous or mouthing manner; and gives an artificial affected air to reading, which detracts greatly both from its agreeablene&s;s, and its impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sheridan and Walker have publi&s;hed dictionaries, for a&s;cer|taining the true and be&s;t pronunciation of the words of our lan|guage. By attentively con&s;ulting them, particularly "Walker's Pronouncing Dictionary," the young reader will be much a&s;|&s;i&s;ted, in his endeavours to attain a correct pronunciation of the words belonging to the Engli&s;h language.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION V. Empha&s;is.</HEAD>
<P>BY Empha&s;is is meant a &s;tronger and fuller &s;ound of voice, by which we di&s;tingui&s;h &s;ome word or words, on which we de&s;ign to lay particular &s;tre&s;s, and to &s;how how they affect the re&s;t of the &s;entence. Sometimes the em|phatic words mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a particular tone of voice, as well as by a particular &s;tre&s;s. On the right ma|nagement of the empha&s;is depends the life of pronunciation. If no empha&s;is be placed on any words, not only is di&s;|cour&s;e rendered heavy and lifele&s;s, but the meaning left often ambiguous. If the empha&s;is be placed wrong, we pervert and confound the meaning wholly.</P>
<P>Empha&s;is may be divided into the SUPERIOR and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> INFERIOR empha&s;is. The &s;uperior empha&s;is determines the meaning of a &s;entence, with reference to &s;omething &s;aid be|fore,
<PB N="xiv" REF="035851_0015_1007AA5F03B77A20">
pre&s;uppo&s;ed by the author as general knowledge, or re|moves an ambiguity, where a pa&s;&s;age may have more &s;en&s;es than one. The inferior empha&s;is <HI>enforces, graces,</HI> and <HI>enlivens,</HI> but does not <HI>fix,</HI> the meaning of any pa&s;&s;age. The words to which this latter empha&s;is is given, are, in general, &s;uch as &s;eem the mo&s;t important in the &s;entence, or, on other ac|counts, to merit this di&s;tinction. The following pa&s;&s;age will &s;erve to exemplify the &s;uperior empha&s;is.</P>
<LG>
<L>" Of man's fir&s;t di&s;obedience, and the fruit</L>
<L>" Of that forbidden tree, who&s;e mortal ta&s;te</L>
<L>" Brought death into the world, and all our wo," &amp;c.</L>
<L>" Sing, heav'nly Mu&s;e!"</L>
</LG>
<P>Suppo&s;ing that originally other beings, be&s;ides men, had di&s;obeyed the commands of the Almighty, and that the circum&s;tance were well known to us, there would fall an empha&s;is upon the word <HI>man's</HI> in the fir&s;t line; and hence it would be read thus:
<Q><L>Of <HI>man's</HI> fir&s;t di&s;obedience, and the fruit, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>But if it were a notorious truth, that mankind had tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed in a peculiar manner more than once, the empha&s;is would fall on <HI>fir&s;t;</HI> and the line be read,
<Q><L>Of man's <HI>fir&s;t</HI> di&s;obedience, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>Again, admitting death (as was really the ca&s;e) to have been an unheard of and dreadful puni&s;hment, brought upon man in con&s;equence of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; on that &s;uppo&s;ition the third line would be read,
<Q><L>"Brought <HI>death</HI> into the world," &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>But if we were to &s;uppo&s;e, that mankind knew there was &s;uch an evil as death in other regions, though the place they inhabited had been free from it till their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the line would run thus:
<Q><L>"Brought death into the <HI>world,"</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="035851_0016_1007AA6163F1F338">
The &s;uperior empha&s;is finds place in the following &s;hort &s;entence, which admits of four di&s;tinct meanings, each of which is a&s;certained by the empha&s;is only.</P>
<P>"Do you ride to town to-day?"</P>

<P>Among a number of per&s;ons, who have had proper oppor|tunities of learning to read, in the be&s;t manner it is now taught, very few could be &s;elected, who, in a given in|&s;tance, would u&s;e the inferior empha&s;is alike, either as to place or quantity. Some per&s;ons, indeed, u&s;e &s;carcely any degree of it: and others do not &s;cruple to carry it much beyond any thing to be found in common di&s;cour&s;e; and even &s;ometimes throw it upon words &s;o very trifling in them&s;elves, that it is evidently done with no other view,
<PB N="xvi" REF="035851_0017_1007AA64DD13CD48">
than to give variety to the modulation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By modulation is meant that plea&s;ing variety of voice, which is perceived in uttering a &s;entence, and which, in its nature, is perfectly di&s;tinct from empha&s;is, and the tones of emotion and pa&s;&s;ion. The young reader &s;hould be careful to render his modulation correct and ea&s;y; and, for this purpo&s;e, &s;hould form it upon the model of the mo&s;t judicious and accurate &s;peakers.</NOTE> Notwith&s;tanding this diver&s;ity of practice, there are certainly proper bounda|ries, within which this empha&s;is mu&s;t be re&s;trained, in or|der to make it meet the approbation of &s;ound judgment and correct ta&s;te. It will doubtle&s;s have different degrees of exertion, according to the greater or le&s;s degree of im|portance of the words upon which it operates; and there may be very properly &s;ome variety in the u&s;e of it; but its application is not arbitrary, depending on the caprice of readers.</P>
<P>As empha&s;is often falls on words in different parts of the &s;ame &s;entence, &s;o it is frequently required to be continued, with a little variation, on two, and &s;ometimes more words together. The following &s;entences exemplify both the parts of this po&s;ition: <Q>If you &s;eek to make one <HI>rich,</HI> &s;tudy not to <HI>increa&s;e his &s;tores,</HI> but to <HI>dimini&s;h, his de&s;ires.</HI></Q> <Q>The Mexican figures, or picture-writing, repre&s;ent <HI>things,</HI> not <HI>words:</HI> they exhibit <HI>images to the eye,</HI> not <HI>ideas to the under&s;tanding.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Some &s;entences are &s;o full and comprehen&s;ive, that almo&s;t every word is emphatical: as, "Ye hills and dales, ye rivers, "woods, and plains!" or, as that pathetic expo&s;tulation in the prophecy of Ezekiel, "Why will ye die!"</P>
<P>Empha&s;is, be&s;ides its other offices, is the great regulator of quantity. Though the quantity of our &s;yllables is fixed, in words &s;eparately pronounced, yet it is mutable, when the&s;e words are ranged in &s;entences; the long being changed
<PB N="xvii" REF="035851_0018_1007AA6764901798">
into &s;hort, the &s;hort into long, according to the importance of the words with regard to meaning. Empha&s;is al&s;o, in particular ca&s;es, alters the &s;eat of the accent. This is de|mon&s;trable from the following examples. <Q>He &s;hall <HI>in</HI>crea&s;e, but I &s;hall <HI>de</HI>crea&s;e.</Q> <Q>There is a difference between giving and <HI>for</HI>giving.</Q> <Q>In this &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, <HI>plau&s;i</HI>bility is much more e&s;&s;ential than <HI>prob</HI>ability.</Q> In the&s;e examples, the empha&s;is requires the accent to be placed on &s;yllables, to which it does not commonly belong.</P>
<P>In order to acquire the proper management of the em|pha&s;is, the great rule to be given, is, that the reader &s;tudy to attain a ju&s;t conception of the force and &s;pirit of the &s;entiments which he is to pronounce. For to lay the em|pha&s;is with exact propriety, is a con&s;tant exerci&s;e of good &s;en&s;e and attention. It is far from being an incon&s;iderable attainment. It is one of the mo&s;t deci&s;ive trials of a true and ju&s;t ta&s;te; and mu&s;t ari&s;e from feeling delicately our|&s;elves, and from judging accurately of what is fitte&s;t to &s;trike the feelings of others.</P>
<P>There is one error, again&s;t which it is particularly proper to caution the learner; namely, that of multiplying em|phatical words too much, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> the empha&s;is indi&s;|criminately. It is only by a prudent re&s;erve and di&s;tinc|tion in the u&s;e of them, that we can give them any weight. If they recur too often; if a reader attempts to render every thing he expre&s;&s;es of high importance, by a multi|tude of &s;trong empha&s;is, we &s;oon learn to pay little regard to them. To crowd every &s;entence with emphatical words, is like crowding all the pages of a book with Italic charac|ters; which, as to the effect, is ju&s;t the &s;ame as to u&s;e no &s;uch di&s;tinctions at all.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VI. Tones.</HEAD>
<P>TONES are different both from empha&s;is and pau&s;es; con&s;i&s;ting in the notes o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> variations of &s;ound which we em|ploy, in the expre&s;&s;ion of our &s;entiments. Empha&s;is affects particular words and phra&s;es, with a degree of tone or inflection of voice; but tones, peculiarly &s;o called, affect &s;entences, paragraphs, and &s;ometimes even the whole of a di&s;cour&s;e</P>
<P>To &s;how the u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity of tones, we need only ob&s;erve, that the mind, in communicating its ideas, is in a con&s;tant &s;tate of activity, emotion, or agitation, from the different effects which tho&s;e ideas produce in the &s;peaker. Now the end of &s;uch communication being, not merely to lay open the ideas, but al&s;o the different feelings which they excite in him who utters them, there mu&s;t be other &s;igns than words, to manife&s;t tho&s;e feelings; as words ut|tered in a monotonous manner, can repre&s;ent only a &s;imilar &s;tate of mind, perfectly free from all activity or emotion. As the communication of the&s;e internal feelings, was of much more con&s;equence in our &s;ocial intercour&s;e, than the mere conveyance of ideas, the Author of our being did not, as in that conveyance, leave the invention of the language of emotion, to man; but impre&s;&s;ed it him&s;elf upon our na|ture, in the &s;ame manner as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> has done with regard to the re&s;t of the animal world; all of which expre&s;s their various feelings, by various tones. Ours, indeed, from the &s;upe|rior rank that we hold, are in a high degree more compre|hen&s;ive; as there is not an act of the mind, an exertion of the fancy, or an emotion of the heart, which has not its
<PB N="xix" REF="035851_0020_1007AA6AC3C09A10">
peculiar tone, or note of the voice, by which it is to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed; and which is &s;uited exactly to the degree of internal feeling. It is chiefly in the proper u&s;e of the&s;e tones, that the life, &s;pirit, beauty, and harmony of delivery con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The limits of this introduction, do not admit of exam|ples, to illu&s;trate the variety of tones belonging to the dif|ferent pa&s;&s;ions and emotions. We &s;hall, however, &s;elect one, which is extracted from the beautiful lamentation of David over Saul and Jonathan, and which will, in &s;ome degree, elucidate what has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject. <Q>The beauty of I&s;rael is &s;lain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath; publi&s;h it not in the &s;treets of A&s;kelon: le&s;t the daughters of the Phili&s;tines rejoice; le&s;t the daughters of the uncircumci&s;ed triumph. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, nor fields of offerings; for there the &s;hield of the mighty was vilely ca&s;t away; the &s;hield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oyl.</Q> The fir&s;t of the&s;e divi&s;ions, expre&s;&s;es &s;orrow and lamentation; therefore the note is low. The next contains a &s;pirited command, and &s;hould be pronounced much higher. The other &s;entence, in which he makes a pathetic addre&s;s to the mountains where his friends had been &s;lain, mu&s;t be ex|pre&s;&s;ed in a note quite different from the two former; not &s;o low as the fir&s;t, nor &s;o high as the &s;econd, in a manly, firm, and yet plaintive tone.</P>
<P>The correct and natural language of the emotions, is not &s;o difficult to be attained, as mo&s;t readers &s;eem to ima|gine. If we enter into the &s;pirit of the author's &s;entiments, as well as into the meaning of his words, we &s;hall not fail to deliver the words in properly varied tones. For there are few people, who &s;peak Engli&s;h without a provincial
<PB N="xx" REF="035851_0021_1007AA6FEB96C870">
note, that have not an accurate u&s;e of tones, when they utter their &s;entiments in earne&s;t di&s;cour&s;e. And the rea&s;on that they have not the &s;ame u&s;e of them, in reading aloud the &s;entiments of others, may be traced to the very defec|tive and erroneous method, in which the art of reading is taught; whereby all the various, natural, expre&s;&s;ive tones of &s;peech, are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and a few artificial, unmeaning reading notes, are &s;ub&s;tituted for them.</P>
<P>But when we recommend to readers, an attention to the tone and language of emotions, we mu&s;t be under&s;tood to do it with proper limitation. Moderation is nece&s;&s;ary in this point, as it is in other things. For when reading becomes &s;trictly imitative, it a&s;&s;umes a theatrical manner, and mu&s;t be highly improper, as well as give offence to the hearers; becau&s;e it is incon&s;i&s;tent with that delicacy and mode&s;ty, which are indi&s;pen&s;able on &s;uch occa&s;ions. The &s;peaker who delivers his own emotions, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be more vivid and animated, than would be proper in the per&s;on who relates them at &s;econd hand.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this &s;ection with the following rule, for the tones that indicate the pa&s;&s;ions and emotions. <Q>In read|ing, let all your tones of expre&s;&s;ion be borrowed from tho&s;e of common &s;peech, but, in &s;ome degree, more faintly cha|racteri&s;ed. Let tho&s;e tones which &s;ignify any di&s;agreeable pa&s;&s;ion of the mind, be &s;till more faint than tho&s;e which indicate agreeable emotions&punc; and, on all occa&s;ions, pre|&s;erve your&s;elves &s;o far from being affected with the &s;ub|ject, as to be able to proceed through it, with that ea&s;y and ma&s;terly manner, which has its good effects in this, as well as in every other art.</Q></P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII. Pau&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>PAUSES or re&s;ts, in &s;peaking or reading, are a total ce&s;&s;a|tion of the voice, during a perceptible, and, in many ca&s;es, a mea&s;urable &s;pace of time. Pau&s;es are equally nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;peaker, and the hearer. To the &s;peaker, that he may take breath, without which he cannot proceed far in delivery; and that he may, by the&s;e temporary re&s;ts, re|lieve the organs of &s;peech, which otherwi&s;e would be &s;oon tired by continued action: to the hearer, that the ear al&s;o may be relieved from the fatigue, which it would otherwi&s;e endure from a continuity of &s;ound; and that the under&s;tanding may have &s;ufficient time to mark the di&s;tinction of &s;entences, and their &s;everal members.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of pau&s;es; fir&s;t, emphatical pau&s;es; and next, &s;uch as mark the di&s;tinctions of &s;en&s;e. An em|phatical pau&s;e is generally made, <HI>after</HI> &s;omething has been &s;aid of peculiar moment, and on which we de&s;ire to fix the hearer's attention. Sometimes, <HI>before</HI> &s;uch a thing is &s;aid, we u&s;her it in with a pau&s;e of this nature. Such pau&s;es have the &s;ame effect as a &s;trong empha&s;is; and are &s;ubject to the &s;ame rules: e&s;pecially to the caution, of not repeating them too frequently. For as they excite uncommon attention, and of cour&s;e rai&s;e expectation, if the importance of the matter be not fully an&s;werable to &s;uch expectation, they occa&s;ion di&s;appointment and di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t frequent and the principal u&s;e of pau&s;es, is, to mark the divi&s;ions of the &s;en&s;e, and at the &s;ame time to allow the reader to draw his breath; and the proper and delicate adju&s;tment of &s;uch pau&s;es, is one of the mo&s;t nice
<PB N="xxii" REF="035851_0023_1007AA747077D258">
and difficult articles of delivery. In all reading, the manage|ment of the br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">h requires a good deal of care, &s;o as not to oblige us to divide words from one another, which have &s;o intimate a connexion, that they ought to be pronounced with the &s;ame breath, and without the lea&s;t &s;eparation. Many a &s;entence is mi&s;erably mangled, and the force of the empha&s;is totally lo&s;t, by divi&s;ions being made in the wrong place. To avoid this, every one, while he is reading, &s;hould be very careful to provide a full &s;upply of breath, for what he is to utter. It is a great mi&s;take to imagine, that the breath mu&s;t be drawn only at the end of a period, when the voice is allowed to fall. It may ea&s;ily be gathered at the intervals of the period, when the voice is &s;u&s;pended only for a moment; and, by this management, one may always have a &s;ufficient &s;tock for carrying on the longe&s;t &s;entence, without improper interruptions.</P>
<P>Pau&s;es in reading mu&s;t generally be formed upon the man|ner in which we utter our&s;elves in ordinary, &s;en&s;ible con|ver&s;ation; and not upon the &s;tiff artificial manner, which is acquired from reading books according to the common punctuation. It will by no means be &s;ufficient to attend to the points u&s;ed in printing: for the&s;e are far from marking all the pau&s;es, which ought to be made in reading. A me|chanical attention to the&s;e re&s;ting places, has perhaps been one cau&s;e of monotony, by leading the reader to a &s;imilar tone at every &s;top, and a uniform cadence at every period. The primary u&s;e of points, is to a&s;&s;i&s;t the reader in di&s;cerning the grammatical con&s;truction; and it is only as a &s;econdary object, that they regulate his pronunciation. On this head, the following direction may be of u&s;e: <Q>Though in reading great attention &s;hould be paid to the &s;tops, yet a greater &s;hould be given to the &s;en&s;e; and their corre&s;pondent
<PB N="xxiii" REF="035851_0024_1007AA76D4833880">
times occa&s;ionally lengthened beyond what is u&s;ual in com|mon &s;peech.</Q></P>
<P>To render pau&s;es plea&s;ing and expre&s;&s;ive, they mu&s;t not only be made in the right place, but al&s;o accompanied with a proper tone of voice, by which the nature of the&s;e pau&s;es is intimated; much more than by the length of them, which can &s;eldom be exactly mea&s;ured. Sometimes it is only a &s;light and &s;imple &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of voice that is proper; &s;ome|times a degree of cadence in the voice is required; and &s;ome|times that peculiar tone and cadence which denote the &s;entence to be fini&s;hed. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, we are to regulate our&s;elves by attending to the manner in which nature teaches us to &s;peak, when engaged in real and earne&s;t di&s;cour&s;e with others. The following &s;entence exemplifies the <HI>&s;u&s;pending</HI> and the <HI>clo&s;ing</HI> pau&s;es: "Hope, the balm of life, &s;ooths us under "every misfortune." The fir&s;t and &s;econd pau&s;es are ac|companied by an inflection of voice, that gives the hearer an expectation of &s;omething further to complete the &s;en&s;e: the inflection attending the third pau&s;e, &s;ignifies that the &s;en&s;e is completed.</P>
<P>The preceding example is an illu&s;tration of the &s;u&s;pend|ing pau&s;e, in its &s;imple &s;tate: the following in&s;tance exhibits that pau&s;e with a degree of cadence in the voice: <Q>If content cannot remove the di&s;quietudes of mankind, it will at lea&s;t alleviate them.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;u&s;pending pau&s;e is often, in the &s;ame &s;entence, at|tended with both the ri&s;ing and the falling inflection of voice; as will be &s;een in this example: <Q>Moderate exer|ci&s;e, and habitual temperance, &s;trengthen the con&s;titu|tion.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ri&s;ing inflection is denoted by the acute, the falling by the grave accent.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="xxiv" REF="035851_0025_1007AA7A66B36CC8">
As the &s;u&s;pending pau&s;e may be thus attended with both the ri&s;ing and the falling inflection, it is the &s;ame with re|gard to the clo&s;ing pau&s;e: it admits of both. The falling inflection generally accompanies it; but it is not unfrequently connected with the ri&s;ing inflection. Interrogative &s;entences, for in&s;tance, are often terminated in this manner: as, "Am I ungrateful?" "Is he in earne&s;t?"</P>
<P>But where a &s;entence is begun by an interrogative pro|noun or adverb, it is commonly terminated by the falling inflection: as, "What has he gained by his folly?" "Who will a&s;&s;i&s;t him?" "Where is the me&s;&s;enger?" "When did he arrive?"</P>
<P>Where two que&s;tions are united in one &s;entence, and con|nected by the conjunction <HI>or,</HI> the fir&s;t takes the ri&s;ing, the &s;econd the falling inflection: as, <Q>Does his conduct &s;upport di&s;cipline, or de&s;troy it?</Q></P>
<P>The ri&s;ing and falling inflections mu&s;t not be confounded with empha&s;is. Though they may often coincide, they are, in their nature, perfectly di&s;tinct. Empha&s;is &s;ometimes controls tho&s;e inflections.</P>
<P>The regular application of the ri&s;ing and falling inflections, confers &s;o much beauty on expre&s;&s;ion, and is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;tudied by the young reader, that we &s;hall in&s;ert a few more examples, to induce him to pay greater attention to the &s;ubject. In the&s;e in&s;tances, all the inflections are not marked. Such only are di&s;tingui&s;hed as are mo&s;t &s;triking, and will be&s;t &s;erve to &s;how the reader their utility and importance.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VIII. Manner of reading Ver&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we are reading ver&s;e, there is a peculiar difficulty in making the pau&s;es ju&s;tly. The difficulty ari&s;es from the melody of ver&s;e, which dictates to the ear pau&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;ts of its own; and to adju&s;t and compound the&s;e properly with the pau&s;es of the &s;en&s;e, &s;o as neither to hurt the ear, nor offend the under&s;tanding, is &s;o very nice a matter, that it is no wonder we &s;o &s;eldom meet with good readers of
<PB N="xxvi" REF="035851_0027_1007AA7E53DED290">
poetry. There are two kinds of pau&s;es that belong to the melody of ver&s;e: one is, the pau&s;e at the end of the line; and the other, the cae&s;ural pau&s;e in or near the middle of it. With regard to the pau&s;e at the end of the line, which marks that &s;train or ver&s;e to be fini&s;hed, rhyme renders this always &s;en&s;ible; and in &s;ome mea&s;ure compels us to ob&s;erve it in our pronunciation. In re&s;pect to blank ver&s;e, we ought al&s;o to read it &s;o as to make every line &s;en&s;ible to the ear: for, what is the u&s;e of melody, or for what end has the poet compo&s;ed in ver&s;e, if in reading his lines, we &s;uppre&s;s his numbers, by omitting the final pau&s;e; and degrade them, by our pronunciation, into mere pro&s;e? At the &s;ame time that we attend to this pau&s;e, every appearance of &s;ing-&s;ong and tone mu&s;t be carefully guarded again&s;t. The clo&s;e of the line, where it makes no pau&s;e in the meaning, ought not to be marked by &s;uch a tone as is u&s;ed in fini&s;hing a &s;entence; but, without either fall or elevation of the voice, it &s;hould be denoted only by &s;uch a &s;light &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of &s;ound, as may di&s;tingui&s;h the pa&s;&s;age from one line to ano|ther, without injuring the meaning.</P>
<P>The other kind of melodious pau&s;e, is that which falls &s;omewhere about the middle of the ver&s;e, and divides it into two hemi&s;tichs; a pau&s;e, not &s;o great as that which be|longs to the clo&s;e of the line, but &s;till &s;en&s;ible to an ordinary ear. This, which is called the cae&s;ural pau&s;e, may fall, in Engli&s;h Heroic ver&s;e, after the 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th &s;yllables in the line. Where the ver&s;e is &s;o con&s;tructed, that this cae&s;ural pau&s;e coincides with the &s;lighte&s;t pau&s;e or divi&s;ion in the &s;en&s;e, the line can be read ea&s;ily; as in the two fir&s;t ver&s;es of Pope's Me&s;&s;iah:
<Q><L>"Ye nymphs of Solyma"! begin the &s;ong;</L>
<L>"To heavenly themes", &s;ublimer &s;trains belong."</L></Q>
<PB N="xxvii" REF="035851_0028_1007AA80E8AA08C0">
But if it &s;hall happen that words which have &s;uch a &s;trict and intimate connexion, as not to bear even a momentary &s;eparation, are divided from one another by this cae&s;ural pau&s;e, we then feel a &s;ort of &s;truggle between the &s;en&s;e and the &s;ound, which renders it difficult to read &s;uch lines har|moniou&s;ly. The rule of proper pronunciation in &s;uch ca&s;es, is to regard only the pau&s;e which the &s;en&s;e forms; and to read the line accordingly. The neglect of the cae&s;ural pau&s;e may make the line &s;ound &s;omewhat unharmoniou&s;ly; but the effect would be much wor&s;e, if the &s;en&s;e were &s;acrificed to the &s;ound. For in&s;tance, in the following line of Milton,
<Q><L>&mdash;"What in me is dark,</L>
<L>"Illumine; what is low, rai&s;e and &s;upport."</L></Q>
the &s;en&s;e clearly dictates the pau&s;e after <HI>illumine,</HI> at the end of the third &s;yllable, which, in reading, ought to be made accordingly; though if the melody only were to be regarded, <HI>illumine</HI> &s;hould be connected with what follows, and the pau&s;e not made till the fourth or &s;ixth &s;yllable. So in the follow|ing line of Pope's Epi&s;tle to Dr. Arbuthnot,
<Q><L>"I &s;it, with &s;ad civility I read."</L></Q>
The ear plainly points out the cae&s;ural pau&s;e as falling af|ter <HI>&s;ad,</HI> the fourth &s;yllable. But it would be very bad reading to make any pau&s;e there, &s;o as to &s;eparate <HI>&s;ad</HI> and <HI>civility.</HI> The &s;en&s;e admits of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o other pau&s;e than after the &s;econd &s;yllable <HI>&s;it,</HI> which therefore mu&s;t be the only pau&s;e made in reading this part of the &s;entence.</P>
<P>There is another mode of dividing &s;ome ver&s;es, by intro|ducing what may be called demi-cae&s;uras, which require very &s;light pau&s;es; and which the reader &s;hould manage with judgment, or he will be apt to fall into an affected &s;ing-&s;ong mode of pronouncing ver&s;es of this kind. The following lines exemplify the demi-cae&s;ura.</P>
<LG>
<PB N="xxviii" REF="035851_0029_1007AA84807A6BD8">
<L>" Warms' in the &s;un", refre&s;hes' in the breeze,</L>
<L>" Glows' in the &s;tars", and blo&s;&s;oms' in the trees;</L>
<L>" Lives through all life", extends' through all extent,</L>
<L>" Spreads' undivided", operates' un&s;pent."</L>

<P>Before the conclu&s;ion of this introduction, the Compiler takes the liberty to recommend to tho&s;e teachers, who may favour his compilation, to exerci&s;e their pupils in di&s;cover|ing and explaining the emphatic words, and the proper tones and pau&s;es of every portion a&s;&s;igned them to read, previou&s;ly to their being called out to the performance. The&s;e preparatory le&s;&s;ons, in which they &s;hould be regularly examined, will improve their judgment and ta&s;te; prevent the practice of reading without attention to the &s;ubject; and e&s;tabli&s;h a habit of readily di&s;covering the meaning, force, and beauty, of every &s;entence they peru&s;e.</P>

Whatever u&s;eful or engaging endowments we po&s;|&s;e&s;s, virtue is a nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ite, in order to their &s;hining with proper lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Virtuous youth gradually brings forward accom|pli&s;hed and flouri&s;hing manhood.</P>
<P>Sincerity and truth form the ba&s;is of every vir|tue.</P>
<P>Truth and error, virtue and vice, are things of im|mutable nature</P>
<P>Change and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> form the very e&s;&s;ence of the world.</P>
<P>True happine&s;s is of a retired nature, and an enemy to pomp and noi&s;e.</P>
<P>In order to acquire a capacity for happine&s;s, it mu&s;t be our fir&s;t &s;tudy to rectify inward di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Whatever purifies, fortifies al&s;o the heart.</P>
<P>From our eagerne&s;s to gra&s;p, we &s;trangle and de|&s;troy plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A temperate &s;pirit, and moderate expectations, are the be&s;t &s;afeguard of the mind, in this uncertain and changing &s;tate.</P>
<P>There is nothing, except &s;implicity of intention, and purity of principle, that can &s;tand the te&s;t of near approach and &s;trict examination.</P>
<P>The value of any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is to be chiefly e&s;timated, by the relief which it can bring us in the time of our greate&s;t need.</P>
<P>No per&s;on who has once yielded up the govern|ment of his mind, and given loo&s;e rein to his de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions, can tell how far the&s;e may carry him.</P>
<P>Tranquillity of mind is always m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t likely to be attained, when the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world is tempered with thoughtful and &s;erious retreat.</P>

He who would act like a wi&s;e man, and build his hou&s;e on the rock, and not on the &s;and, &s;hould con|template human life, not only in the &s;un&s;hine, but in the &s;hade.</P>
<P>Let u&s;efulne&s;s and beneficence, not o&s;tentation and vanity, direct the train of your pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>To maintain a &s;teady and unbroken mind, amid&s;t all the &s;hocks of the world, marks a great and noble &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Patience, by pre&s;erving compo&s;ure within, re&s;i&s;ts the impre&s;&s;ion which trouble makes from without.</P>
<P>Compa&s;&s;ionate affections, even when they draw tears from our eyes for human mi&s;ery, convey &s;atisfaction to the heart.</P>
<P>They who have nothing to give, can often afford relief to others, by imparting what they feel.</P>
<P>Our ignorance of what is to come, and of what is really good or evil, &s;hould correct anxiety about world|ly &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The veil which covers from our &s;ight the events of &s;ucceeding years, is a veil woven by the hand of mercy.</P>

Were we to &s;urvey the chambers of &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, we &s;hould often find them peopled with the victims of intemperance and &s;en&s;uality, and with the children of vicious indolence and &s;loth.</P>
<P>To be wi&s;e in our own eyes, to be wi&s;e in the opi|nion of the world, and to be wi&s;e in the &s;ight of our Creator, are three things &s;o very different, as rarely to coincide.</P>
<P>Man, in his highe&s;t earthly glory, is but a reed float|ing on the &s;tream of time, and forced to follow every new direction of the current.</P>
<P>The corrupted temper, and the guilty pa&s;&s;ions of the bad, fru&s;trate the effect of every advantage which the world confers on them.</P>
<P>The external misfortunes of life, di&s;appointments, poverty, and &s;ickne&s;s, are nothing in compari&s;on of tho&s;e inward di&s;tre&s;&s;es of mind, occa&s;ioned by folly, by pa&s;&s;ion, and by guilt.</P>
<P>No &s;tation is &s;o high, no power &s;o great, no cha|racter &s;o unblemi&s;hed, as to exempt men from being attacked by ra&s;hne&s;s, malice, or envy.</P>
<P>Moral and religious in&s;truction derives its efficacy, not &s;o much from what men are taught to know, as from what they are brought to feel.</P>
<P>He who pretends to great &s;en&s;ibility towards men, and yet has no feeling for the high objects of religion, no heart to admire and adore the great Father of the univer&s;e, has rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t the truth and delicacy of his &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>When, upon rational and &s;ober inquiry, we have e&s;tabli&s;hed our principles, let us not &s;uffer them to be &s;haken by the &s;coffs of the licentions, or the cavils of the &s;ceptical.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="035851_0042_1007AAA807BB1870">
When we ob&s;erve any tendency to treat religion or morals with di&s;re&s;pect and levity, let us hold it to be a &s;ure indication of a perverted under&s;tanding, or a depraved heart.</P>
<P>Every degree of guilt incurred by yielding to temp|tation, tends to deba&s;e the mind, and to weaken the generous and benevolent principles of human nature.</P>
<P>Luxury, pride, and vanity, have frequently as much influence in corrupting the &s;entiments of the great, as ignorance, bigotry, and prejudice, have in mi&s;leading the opinions of the multitude.</P>
<P>Mixed as the pre&s;ent &s;tate is, rea&s;on and religion pronounce, that generally, if not always, there is more happine&s;s than mi&s;ery, more plea&s;ure than pain, in the condition of man.</P>
<P>Society, when formed, requires di&s;tinctions of pro|perty, diver&s;ity of conditions, &s;ubordination of ranks, and a multiplicity of occupations, in order to advance the general good.</P>
<P>That the temper, the &s;entiments, the morality, and, in general, the whole conduct and character of men, are influenced by the example and di&s;po&s;ition of the per&s;ons with whom they a&s;&s;ociate, is a reflection which has long &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed into a proverb, and been ranked among the &s;tanding maxims of human wi&s;dom, in all ages of the world.</P>

<P>THE de&s;ire of improvement di&s;covers a liberal mind; and is connected with many accompli&s;hments, and ma|ny virtues.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="035851_0043_1007AAA9910DDC28">
Innocence confers ea&s;e and freedom on the mind; and leaves it open to every plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>Moderate and &s;imple plea&s;ures reli&s;h high with the temperate: in the mid&s;t of his &s;tudied refinements, the voluptuary langui&s;hes.</P>
<P>Gentlene&s;s corrects whatever is offen&s;ive in our man|ners; and, by a con&s;tant train of humane attentions, &s;tudies to alleviate the burden of common mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>That gentlene&s;s which is the characteri&s;tic of a good man, has, like every other virtue, its &s;eat in the heart: and, let me add, nothing except what flows from the heart, can render even external manners truly plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Virtue, to become either vigorous or u&s;eful, mu&s;t be habitually active: not breaking forth occa&s;ionally with a tran&s;ient lu&s;tre, like the blaze of the come<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; but re|gular in its returns, like the light of day: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">not like the aromatic gale, which &s;ometimes fea&s;ts the &s;en&s;e; but like the ordinary breeze, which purifies the air, and renders it healthful.</P>
<P>The happine&s;s of every man depends more upon the &s;tate of his own mind, than upon any one external cir|cum&s;tance; nay, more than upon all external things put together.</P>
<P>In no &s;tation, in no period, let us think our&s;elves &s;ecure from the dangers which &s;pring from our pa&s;|&s;ions. Every age, and every &s;tation they be&s;et; from youth to grey hairs, and from the pea&s;ant to the prince.</P>
<P>Riches and plea&s;ures are the chief temptations to criminal deeds. Yet tho&s;e riches, when obtained, may very po&s;&s;ibly overwhelm us with unfore&s;een mi&s;eries. Tho&s;e plea&s;ures may cut &s;hort our health and life.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="035851_0044_1007AAAB1B185EF0">
He who is accu&s;tomed to turn a&s;ide from the world, and commune with him&s;elf in retirement, will, &s;ome|times at lea&s;t, hear the truths which the multitude do not tell him. A more &s;ound in&s;tructer will lift his voice, and awaken within the heart tho&s;e latent &s;ug|ge&s;tions, which the world had overpowered and &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more amiable than a con&s;tant de|&s;ire to plea&s;e; and an unwillingne&s;s to offend or hurt.</P>
<P>He that waits for an opportunity to do much at once, may breathe out his life in idle wi&s;hes; and re|gret, in the la&s;t hour, his u&s;ele&s;s intentions and barren zeal.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of true religion breathes mildne&s;s and af|fability. It gives a native, unaffected ea&s;e to the be|haviour. It is &s;ocial, kind, and cheerful: far removed from that gloomy and illiberal &s;uper&s;tition, which clouds the brow, &s;harpens the temper, dejects the &s;pirit, and teaches men to fit them&s;elves for another world, by neglecting the concerns of this.</P>
<P>Reveal none of the &s;ecrets of thy friend. Be faith|ful to his intere&s;ts. For&s;ake him not in danger. Ab|hor the thought of acquiring any advantage by his pre|judice.</P>
<P>Man, always pro&s;perous, would be giddy and in&s;o|lent; always afflicted, would be &s;ullen or de&s;pondent. Hopes and fears, joy and &s;orrow, are, therefore, &s;o blended in his life, as both to give room for worldly pur&s;uits, and to recal, from time to time, the admoni|tions of con&s;cience.</P>

<P>TIME once pa&s;t never returns: the moment which is lo&s;t, is lo&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>There is nothing on earth &s;o &s;table, as to a&s;&s;ure us of undi&s;turbed re&s;t; nor &s;o powerful, as to afford us con|&s;tant protection.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of fea&s;ting too often becomes an avenue to the hou&s;e of mourning. Short, to the licentious, is the interval between them.</P>
<P>It is of great importance to us, to form a proper e&s;|timate of human life; without either loading it with imaginary evils, or expecting from it greater advanta|ges than it is able to yield.</P>
<P>Among all our corrupt pa&s;&s;ions, there is a &s;trong and intimate connexion. When any one of them is adopt|ed into our family, it &s;eldom quits us until it has father|ed upon us all its kindred.</P>
<P>Charity, like the &s;un, brightens every object on which it &s;hines: a cen&s;orious di&s;po&s;ition ca&s;ts every character into the darke&s;t &s;hade it will bear.</P>
<P>Many men mi&s;take the love, for the practice of vir|tue; and are not &s;o much good men, as the friends of goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Genuine virtue has a language that &s;peaks to every heart throughout the world. It is a language which is under&s;tood by all. In every region, every clime, the homage paid to it is the &s;ame. In no one &s;entiment were ever mankind more generally agreed.</P>
<P>The appearances of our &s;ecurity are frequently de|ceitful. When our &s;ky &s;eems mo&s;t &s;ettled and &s;erene, in &s;ome unob&s;erved quarter gathers the little black

cloud, in which the tempe&s;t ferments, and prepares to di&s;charge it&s;elf on our head.</P>
<P>The man of true fortitude may be compared to the ca&s;tle built on a rock, which defies the attacks of &s;ur|rounding waters: the man of a feeble and timorous &s;pirit, to a hut placed on the &s;hore, which every wind &s;hakes, and every wave overflows.</P>
<P>Nothing is &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as vio|lent anger. It overpowers rea&s;on; confounds our ideas; di&s;torts the appearance, and blackens the co|lour, of every object. By the &s;torm which it rai&s;es within, and by the mi&s;chiefs which it occa&s;ions with|out, it generally brings on the pa&s;&s;ionate and revenge|ful man, greater mi&s;ery than he can bring on the object of his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The palace of virtue has, in all ages, been repre&s;ent|ed as placed on the &s;ummit of a hill; in the a&s;cent of which, labour is requi&s;ite, and difficulties are to be &s;ur|mounted; and where a conductor is needed, to direct our way, and to aid our &s;teps.</P>
<P>In judging of others, let us always think the be&s;t, and employ the &s;pirit of charity and candour. But in judging of our&s;elves, we ought to be exact and &s;evere.</P>
<P>Let him that de&s;ires to &s;ee others happy, make ha&s;te to give while his gift can be enjoyed; and remember, that every moment of delay, takes away &s;omething from the value of his benefaction. And let him who propo&s;es his own happine&s;s reflect, that while he forms his purpo&s;e, the day rolls on, and "the might cometh, when no man can work."</P>
<P>To &s;en&s;ual per&s;ons, hardly any thing is what it appears to be: and what flatters mo&s;t, is always farth|e&s;t from reality. There are voices which &s;ing around
<PB N="10" REF="035851_0047_1007AAB3B94F5F18">
them; but who&s;e &s;trains allure to ruin. There is a banquet &s;pread, where poi&s;on is in every di&s;h. There is a couch which invites them to repo&s;e; but to &s;lumber upon it, is death.</P>
<P>If we would judge whether a man is really happy, it is not &s;olely to his hou&s;es and lands, to his equipage and his retinue, we are to look. Unle&s;s we could &s;ee farther, and di&s;cern what joy, or what bitterne&s;s, his heart feels, we can pronounce nothing concerning him.</P>
<P>The book is well written; and I have peru&s;ed it with plea&s;ure and profit. It &s;hows, fir&s;t, that true de|votion is rational and well founded; next, that it is of the highe&s;t importance to every other part of religion and virtue; and, la&s;tly, that it is mo&s;t conducive to our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>There is certainly no greater felicity, than to be able to look back on a life u&s;efully and virtuou&s;ly employed; to trace our own progre&s;s in exi&s;tence, by &s;uch tokens as excite neither &s;hame nor &s;orrow. It ought therefore to be the care of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to pa&s;s the la&s;t hours with comfort, to lay up &s;uch a trea&s;ure of plea&s;ing ideas, as &s;hall &s;upport the expen&s;es of that time, which is to depend wholly upon the fund already acquired.</P>

No: I appeal to your hearts, my friends, if what you recollect with mo&s;t plea&s;ure are not the innocent, the virtuous, the honourable parts of your pa&s;t life.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent employment of time &s;hould frequently be an object of thought. About what are we now bu|&s;ied? What is the ultimate &s;cope of our pre&s;ent pur&s;uits and cares? Can we ju&s;tify them to our&s;elves? Are they likely to produce any thing that will &s;urvive the mo|ment, and bring forth &s;ome fruit for futurity?</P>
<P>Is it not &s;trange, (&s;ays an ingenious writer,) that &s;ome per&s;ons &s;hould be &s;o delicate as not to bear a di&s;|agreeable picture in the hou&s;e, and yet, by their beha|viour, force every face they &s;ee about them, to wear the doom of unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;content?</P>

<P>Socrates, though primarily attentive to the culture of his mind, was not negligent of his external appear|ance.

It was immediately brought to him: but, as he was putting the ve&s;&s;el to his mouth, a poor wounded &s;oldier, who happened at that in&s;tant to be carried by him, looked up to it with wi&s;hful eyes.

<P>We &s;hould cheri&s;h &s;entiments of charity towards all men. The Author of all good nouri&s;hes much piety and virtue in hearts that are unknown to us; and beholds repentance ready to &s;pring up among many, whom we con&s;ider as reprobates.</P>

No one ought to con&s;ider him&s;elf as in&s;ignificant in the &s;ight of his Creator. In our &s;everal &s;tations, we are all &s;ent forth to be labourers in the vineyard of our heavenly Father. Every man has his work allotted, his talent committed to him; by the due improvement of which he may, in one way or other, &s;erve God, promote virtue, and be u&s;eful in the world.</P>
<P>The love of prai&s;e &s;hould be pre&s;erved under proper &s;ubordination to the principle of duty. In it&s;elf, it is a u&s;eful motive to action; but when allowed to extend its influence too far, it corrupts the whole character; and produces guilt, di&s;grace, and mi&s;ery. To be en|tirely de&s;titute of it, is a defect. To be governed by it, is depravity. The proper adju&s;tment of the &s;everal principles of action in human nature, is a matter that de&s;erves our highe&s;t attention. For when any one of them becomes either too weak or too &s;trong, it en|dangers both our virtue and our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions of a vicious man, having once obtained an unlimited &s;way, trample him under their feet. They make him feel that he is &s;ubject to various, contradictory, and imperious ma&s;ters, who often pull him different ways. His &s;oul is rendered the receptacle of many repugnant and jarring di&s;po&s;i|tions; and re&s;embles &s;ome barbarous country cantoned out into different principalities, which are continually waging war on one another.</P>
<P>Di&s;ea&s;es, poverty, di&s;appointment, and &s;hame, are far from being, in every in&s;tance, the unavoidable doom of man. They are much more frequently the off&s;pring of his own mi&s;guided choice. Intemperance en|genders di&s;ea&s;e, &s;loth produces poverty, pride creates di&s;appointments, and di&s;hone&s;ty expo&s;es to &s;hame.

The ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions of men betray them into a thou&s;and follies; their follies into crimes; and their crimes into misfortunes.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the many di&s;tre&s;&s;es which abound in human life; on the &s;canty proportion of happine&s;s which any man is here allowed to enjoy; on the &s;mall difference which the diver&s;ity of fortune makes on that &s;canty proportion; it is &s;urpri&s;ing, that envy &s;hould ever have been a prevalent pa&s;&s;ion among men, much more that it &s;hould have prevailed among Chri&s;tians. Where &s;o much is &s;uffered in common, little room is left for envy. There is more occa&s;ion for pity and &s;ympathy, and inclination to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other.</P>
<P>At out fir&s;t &s;etting out in life, when yet unacquainted with the world and its &s;nares, when every plea&s;ure enchants with its &s;mile, and every object &s;hines with the glo&s;s of novelty; let us beware of the &s;educing appearances which &s;urround us; and recollect what others have &s;uffered from the power of head&s;trong de|&s;ire. If we allow any pa&s;&s;ion, even though it be e&s;teemed innocent, to acquire an ab&s;olute a&s;cendant, our inward peace will be impaired.

<P>WHENCE ari&s;es the mi&s;ery of this pre&s;ent world? It is not owing to our cloudy atmo&s;phere, our changing &s;ea&s;ons, and inclement &s;kies. It is not owing to the debility of our bodies, or to the unequal di&s;tribution of the goods of fortune. Amid&s;t all di&s;advantages of this kind, a pure, a &s;tedfa&s;t, and enlightened mind, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;trong virtue, could enjoy it&s;elf in peace, and &s;mile at the impotent a&s;&s;aults of fortune and the ele|ments. It is within our&s;elves that mi&s;ery has fixed its &s;eat. Our di&s;ordered hearts, our guilty pa&s;&s;ions, our violent prejudices, and mi&s;placed de&s;ires, are the in|&s;truments of the trouble which we endure. The&s;e &s;harpen the darts which adver&s;ity would otherwi&s;e point in vain again&s;t us.</P>
<P>While the vain and the licentious are revelling in the mid&s;t of extravagance and riot, how little do they think of tho&s;e &s;cenes of &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s which are pa&s;&s;ing at that moment throughout the world: multitudes &s;truggling for a poor &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, to &s;upport the wife and the chil|dren whom they love, and who look up to them with eager eyes for that bread which they can hardly pro|cure; multitudes groaning under &s;ickne&s;s in de&s;olate cottages, untended and unmourned; many, apparently in a better &s;ituation of life, pining away in &s;ecret with concealed griefs; families weeping over the beloved friends whom they have lo&s;t, or, in all the bitterne&s;s

of angui&s;h, bidding tho&s;e who are ju&s;t expiring the la&s;t adieu.</P>
<P>Never adventure on too near an approach to what is evil. Familiari&s;e not your&s;elves with it, in the &s;lighte&s;t in&s;tances, without fear. Li&s;ten with reve|rence to every reprehen&s;ion of con&s;cience; and pre|&s;erve the mo&s;t quick and accurate &s;en&s;ibility to right and wrong. If ever your moral impre&s;&s;ions begin to decay, and your natural abhorrence of guilt to le&s;&s;en, you have ground to dread that the ruin of virtue is fa&s;t approaching.</P>
<P>By di&s;appointments and trials the violence of our pa&s;&s;ions is tamed, and our minds are formed to &s;obriety and reflection. In the varieties of life, occa&s;ioned by the vici&s;&s;itudes of worldly fortune, we are inured to habits both of the active and the &s;uffering virtues. How much &s;oever we complain of the vanity of the world, facts plainly &s;how, that if its vanity were le&s;s, it could not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of &s;alutary di&s;cipline. Un&s;a|tisfactory as it is, its plea&s;ures are &s;till too apt to cor|rupt our hearts. How fatal then mu&s;t the con&s;equen|ces have been, had it yielded us more complete enjoy|ment! If, with all its troubles, we are in danger of being too much attached to it, how entirely would it have &s;educed our affections, if no troubles had been mingled with its plea&s;ures!</P>
<P>In &s;ea&s;ons of di&s;tre&s;s or difficulty, to abandon our|&s;elves to dejection, carries no mark of a great or a wor|thy mind. In&s;tead of &s;inking under trouble, and de|claring "that his &s;oul is weary of life," it becomes a wi&s;e and a good man, in the evil day, with firmne&s;s to maintain his po&s;t; to bear up again&s;t the &s;torm; to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e advantages which, in the wor&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="035851_0061_1007AADA9071B780">
of times, are always left to integrity and virtue; and never to give up the hope that better days may yet ari&s;e.</P>
<P>How many young per&s;ons have at fir&s;t &s;et out in the world with excellent di&s;po&s;itions of heart; generous, charitable and humane; kind to their friends, and amiable among all with whom they had intercour&s;e! And yet, how often have we &s;een all tho&s;e fair appear|ances unhappily bla&s;ted in the progre&s;s of life, mere|ly through the influence of loo&s;e and corrupting plea|&s;ures; and tho&s;e very per&s;ons, who promi&s;ed once to be ble&s;&s;ings to the world, &s;unk down, in the end, to be the burden and nui&s;ance of &s;ociety!</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common propen&s;ity of mankind, is, to &s;tore futurity with whatever is agreeable to them; e&s;peci|ally in tho&s;e periods of life, when imagination is lively, and hope is ardent. Looking forward to the year now beginning, they are ready to promi&s;e them&s;elves much, from the foundations of pro&s;perity which they have laid; from the friend&s;hips and connexions which they have &s;ecured; and from the plans of conduct which they have formed. Alas! how deceitful do all the&s;e dreams of happine&s;s often prove! While many are &s;aying in &s;ecret to their hearts, "To-morrow &s;hall be as this day, and more abundantly," we are obliged in return to &s;ay to them; "Boa&s;t not your&s;elves of to|morrow, for you know not what a day may bring forth!</P>

<P>DIONYSIUS, the tyrant of Sicily, was far from being happy, though he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great riches, and all the plea&s;ures which wealth and power could procure. Damocles, one of his flatterers, deceived by the&s;e &s;pe|cious appearances of happine&s;s, took occa&s;ion to com|pliment him on the extent of his power, his trea&s;ures, and royal magnificence; and declared that no monarch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad ever been greater or happier than Diony&s;ius.</P>
<P>Ha&s;t thou a mind, Damocles," &s;ays the King, "to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;te this happine&s;s; and to know, by experience, what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> enjoyments are, of which thou ha&s;t &s;o high an idea?" Damocles, with joy, accepted the offer. The King ordered that a royal banquet &s;hould be prepared, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gilded &s;ofa, covered with rich embroidery, placed for his favourite. Side-boards, loaded with gold and &s;ilver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">late of immen&s;e value, were arranged in the apart|ment.

But in the mid&s;t of all this happine&s;s, as he lay indulging him&s;elf in &s;tate, he &s;ees let down from the ceiling, exactly over his head, a glittering &s;word hung by a &s;ingle hair. The &s;ight of impending de&s;truction put a &s;peedy end to his joy and revelling.

<P>By this device, Diony&s;ius intimated to Damocles, how mi&s;erable he was in the mid&s;t of all his trea&s;ures; and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the honours and enjoyments which royalty could be&s;tow.</P>

<P>IN the days of Joram, King of I&s;rael, flouri&s;hed the prophet Eli&s;ha.

The me&s;&s;enger employed on this occa&s;ion was Hazael, who appears to have been one of the princes, or chief men of the Syrian court. Charged with rich gifts from the king, he pre&s;ents him&s;elf before the prophet; and acco&s;ts him in terms of the highe&s;t re&s;pect. During the conference which they held together, Eli&s;ha fixed his eye

&s;tedfa&s;tly on the countenance of Hazael; and di&s;cerning, by a prophetic &s;pirit, his future tyranny and cruelty, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould not contain him&s;elf from bur&s;ting into a flood of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ears. When Hazael, in &s;urpri&s;e, inquired into the cau&s;e of this &s;udden emotion, the prophet plainly in|forms him of the crimes and barbarities, which he fore|&s;aw that hereafter he would commit. The &s;oul of Ha|zael abhorred, at this time, the thoughts of cruelty. Uncorrupted, as yet, by ambition or greatne&s;s, his in|dignation ro&s;e at being thought capable of &s;uch &s;avage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ions, as the prophet had mentioned; and, with much warmth, he replies; "But what? is thy &s;ervant a dog, that he &s;hould do this great thing?" Eli&s;ha makes no return, but to point out a remarkable change, which was to take place in his condition; "The Lord hath known me that thou &s;halt be king over Syria." In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our&s;e of time, all that had been predicted came to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

<P>In this pa&s;&s;age of hi&s;tory, an object is pre&s;ented, which de&s;erves our &s;erious attention.

<HEAD>SECTION III. Haman; or, The Mi&s;ery of Pride.</HEAD>
<P>AHASUERUS, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the prince known among the Greek hi&s;torians by the name of Artaxerxes, had advanced to the chief dignity in his kingdom, Haman, an Amalekite, who inherited all the ancient enmity of his race to the Jewi&s;h nation. He appears, from what is recorded of him, to have been a very wicked mini&s;ter. Rai&s;ed to greatne&s;s without merit, he employed his power &s;olely for the gratification of his pa&s;&s;ions. As the honours which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were next to royal, his pride was every day fed with that &s;ervile homage, which is peculiar to A&s;iatic courts; and all the &s;ervants of the king pro|&s;trated them&s;elves before him. In the mid&s;t of this general adulation, one per&s;on only &s;tooped not to Ha|man. This was Mordecai the Jew; who, knowing this Amalekite to be an enemy to the people of God, and, with virtuous indignation, de&s;pi&s;ing that in&s;o|lence of pro&s;perity with which he &s;aw him lifted up, "bowed not, nor did him reverence." On this ap|pearance of di&s;re&s;pect from Mordecai, Haman "was full of wrath: but he thought &s;corn to lay hands on Mordecai alone." Per&s;onal revenge was not &s;uffi|cient to &s;atisfy him. So violent and black were his pa&s;|&s;ions, that he re&s;olved to exterminate the whole nation to which Mordecai belonged. Abu&s;ing, for this cruel purpo&s;e, the favour of his credulous &s;overeign, he ob|tained a decree to be &s;ent forth, that, again&s;t a certain
<PB N="29" REF="035851_0066_1007AAE7DD056D98">
day, all the Jews throughout the Per&s;ian dominions &s;hould be put to the &s;word. Meanwhile, confident of &s;ucce&s;s, and blind to approaching ruin, he continued exulting in his pro&s;perity. Invited by Aha&s;uerus to a royal banquet, which E&s;ther the queen had prepared, "he went forth that day joyful, and with a glad heart." But behold how &s;light an incident was &s;ufficient to poi|&s;on his joy! As he went forth, he &s;aw Mordecai in the king's gate; and ob&s;erved, that he &s;till refu&s;ed to do him homage: "He &s;tood not up, nor was moved for him;" although he well knew the formidable de&s;igns, which Haman was preparing to execute. One private man, who de&s;pi&s;ed his greatne&s;s, and di&s;dained &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, while a whole kingdom trembled before him; one &s;pirit, which the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of his power could neither &s;ubdue nor humble, bla&s;ted his triumphs. His whole &s;oul was &s;haken with a &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ion. Wrath, pride, and de&s;ire of revenge, ro&s;e into fury. With difficulty he re&s;trained him&s;elf in public; but as &s;oon as he came to his own hou&s;e, he was forced to di&s;clo&s;e the agony of his mind. He gathered together his friends and family, with Zere&s;h his wife. "He told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and of all the things wherein the king had promoted him; and how he had advanced him above the princes and &s;ervants of the king. He &s;aid, moreover, Yea, E&s;ther the queen &s;uffered no man to come in with the king, to the banquet that &s;he had prepared, but my&s;elf; and to-morrow al&s;o am I invited to her with the king."

<P>As Ortogrul of Ba&s;ra, was one day wandering along the &s;treets of Bagdat, mu&s;ing on the varieties of mer|chandi&s;e, which the &s;hops offered to his view; and ob|&s;erving the different occupations which bu&s;ied the mul|titudes on every &s;ide, he was awakened from the tran|quillity of meditation, by a crowd that ob&s;tructed his pa&s;&s;age. He rai&s;ed his eyes, and &s;aw the chief vizier, who, having returned from the divan, was entering his palace.</P>
<P>Ortogrul mingled with the attendants; and being &s;up|po&s;ed to have &s;ome petition for the vizier, was permitted to enter. He &s;urveyed the &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s of the apart|ments, admired the walls hung with golden tape&s;try, and the floors covered with &s;ilken carpets; and de|&s;pi&s;ed the &s;imple neatne&s;s of his own little habitation.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="035851_0068_1007AAEAF1974C18">
"Surely," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "this palace is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eat of happine&s;s; where plea&s;ure &s;ucceeds to plea&s;ure, and di&s;content and &s;orrow can have no admi&s;&s;ion. Whatever nature has provided for the delight of &s;en&s;e, is here &s;pread forth to be enjoyed. What can mortals hope or imagine, which the ma&s;ter of this palace has not obtained? The di&s;hes of luxury cover his table; the voice of harmony lulls him in his bowers; he breathes the fragrance of the groves of Java, and &s;leeps upon the down of the cygnets of Ganges. He &s;peaks, and his mandate is obeyed; he wi&s;hes, and his wi&s;h is gratified; all whom he &s;ees obey him, and all whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hears flatter him. How different, Ortogrul, is thy condition, who art doomed to the perpetual torments of un&s;atisfied de&s;ire; and who ha&s;t no amu&s;ement in thy power, that can withhold thee from thy own re|flections! They tell thee that thou art wi&s;e; but what does wi&s;dom avail with poverty? None will flatter the poor; and the wi&s;e have very little power of flattering them&s;elves. That man is &s;urely the mo&s;t wretched of the &s;ons of wretchedne&s;s, who lives with his own faults and follies always before him; and who has none to reconcile him to him&s;elf by prai&s;e and veneration. I have long &s;ought content, and have not found it; I will from this moment endeavour to be rich."</P>
<P>Full of his new re&s;olution, he &s;hut him&s;elf in his chamber for &s;ix months, to deliberate how he &s;hould grow rich. He &s;ometimes purpo&s;ed to offer him&s;elf as a coun&s;ellor to one of the kings of India; and &s;ome|times re&s;olved to dig for diamonds in the mines of Gol|conda. One day, after &s;ome hours pa&s;&s;ed in violent fluctuation of opinion, &s;leep in&s;en&s;ibly &s;eized him in his chair. He dreamed that he was ranging a de&s;ert
<PB N="32" REF="035851_0069_1007AAEEE3A3EAA8">
country, in &s;earch of &s;ome one that might teach him to grow rich; and as he &s;tood on the top of a hill, &s;haded with cypre&s;s, in doubt whither to direct his &s;teps, his father appeared on a &s;udden &s;tanding before him. "Ortogrul," &s;aid the old man, "I know thy perplexity; li&s;ten to thy father; turn thine eye on the oppo&s;ite mountain." Ortogrul looked, and &s;aw a tor|rent tumbling down the rocks, roaring with the noi&s;e of thunder, and &s;cattering its foam on the impending woods. "Now," &s;aid his father, "behold the valley that lies between the hills." Ortogrul looked, and e&s;pied a little well, out of which i&s;&s;ued a &s;mall rivulet. "Tell me now," &s;aid his father, "do&s;t thou wi&s;h for &s;udden affluence, that may pour upon thee like the mountain torrent; or for a &s;low and gradual increa&s;e, re&s;embling the rill gliding from the well?" "Let me be quickly rich," &s;aid Ortogrul; "let the golden &s;tream be quick and violent." "Look round thee," &s;aid his father, "once again." Ortogrul looked, and per|ceived the channel of the torrent dry and du&s;ty; but following the rivulet from the well, he traced it to a wide lake, which the &s;upply, &s;low and con&s;tant, kept always full. He awoke, and determined to grow rich by &s;ilent profit, and per&s;evering indu&s;try.</P>
<P>Having &s;old his patrimony, he engaged in merchan|di&s;e; and in twenty years purcha&s;ed lands, on which he rai&s;ed a hou&s;e, equal in &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s to that of the vizier, to which he invited all the mini&s;ters of Plea|&s;ure, expecting to enjoy all the felicity which he had imagined riches able to afford. Lei&s;ure &s;oon made him weary of him&s;elf, and he longed to be per&s;uaded that he was great and happy. He was courteous and liberal; he gave all that approached him hopes of plea|&s;ing
<PB N="33" REF="035851_0070_1007AAF2C60CC078">
him, and all who &s;hould plea&s;e him, hopes of be|ing rewarded. Every art of prai&s;e was tried, and every &s;ource of adulatory fiction was exhau&s;ted. Ortogrul heard his flatterers without delight, becau&s;e he found him&s;elf unable to believe them. His own heart told him its frailties; his own under&s;tanding reproached him with his faults. "How long," &s;aid he, with a deep &s;igh, "have I been labouring in vain to ama&s;s wealth, which at la&s;t is u&s;ele&s;s! Let no man hereafter wi&s;h to be rich, who is already too wi&s;e to be flattered!"</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. Lady Jane Grey.</HEAD>
<P>THIS excellent per&s;onage was de&s;cended from the Royal Line of England by both her parents.</P>
<P>She was carefully educated in the principles of the Reformation; and her wi&s;dom and virtue rendered her a &s;hining example to her &s;ex. But it was her lot to continue only a &s;hort period on this &s;tage of being; for, in early life, &s;he fell a &s;acrifice to the wild ambition of the Duke of Northumberland; who promoted a mar|riage between her and his &s;on, Lord Guilford Dudley; and rai&s;ed her to the throne of England, in oppo&s;ition to the rights of Mary and Elizabeth. At the time of their marriage, &s;he was only about eighteen years of age, and her hu&s;band was al&s;o very young: a &s;ea&s;on of life very unequal to oppo&s;e the intere&s;ted views of artful and a&s;piring men; who, in&s;tead of expo&s;ing them to danger, &s;hould have been the protectors of their inno|cence and youth.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="035851_0071_1007AAF44F64DF48">
This extraordinary young per&s;on, be&s;ides the &s;olid endowments of piety and virtue, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t en|gaging di&s;po&s;ition, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed parts; and being of an equal age with King Edward VI, &s;he had received all her education with him, and &s;eemed even to po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater facility in acquiring every part of manly and cla&s;&s;ical literature. She had attained a knowledge of the Roman and Greek languages, as well as of &s;everal modern tongues; had pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of her time in an application to learning; and expre&s;&s;ed a great indifference for other occupations and amu&s;e|ments u&s;ual with her &s;ex and &s;tation. Roger A&s;cham, tutor to the Lady Elizabeth, having at one time paid her a vi&s;it, found her employed in reading Plato, while the re&s;t of the family were engaged in a party of hunt|ing in the park; and upon his admiring the &s;ingularity of her choice, &s;he told him, that &s;he "received more plea&s;ure from that author, than the others could reap from all their &s;port and gaiety."&mdash;Her heart, replete with this love of literature and &s;erious &s;tudies, and with tenderne&s;s towards her hu&s;band, who was de&s;erv|ing of her affection, had never opened it&s;elf to the flattering allurements of ambition; and the informa|tion of he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> advancement to the throne was by no means agreeable to her. She even refu&s;ed to accept of the crown; pleaded the preferable right of the two prin|ce&s;&s;es; expre&s;&s;ed her dread of the con&s;equences at|tending an enterpri&s;e &s;o dangerous, not to &s;ay &s;o cri|minal; and de&s;ired to remain in that private &s;tation in which &s;he was born. Overcome at la&s;t with the entreaties, rather than rea&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of her father and father-in-law, and, above all, of her hu&s;band, &s;he &s;ub|mitted to their will, and was prevailed on to relinqui&s;h
<PB N="35" REF="035851_0072_1007AAF6E50DFA28">
her own judgment. But this honour was of very &s;hort continuance. The nation declared for Queen Mary; and the Lady Jane, after wearing the vain pageantry of a crown during ten days, returned to a private life, with much more &s;atisfaction than &s;he felt when the royalty was tendered to her.</P>
<P>Queen Mary, who appears to have been incapable of genero&s;ity or clemency, determined to remove every per&s;on, from whom the lea&s;t danger could be appre|hended. Warning, was, therefore, given the Lady Jane to prepare for death; a doom which &s;he had ex|pected, and which the innocence of her life, as well as the misfortunes to which &s;he had been expo&s;ed, render|ed no unwelcome news to her. The Queen's bigotted zeal, under colour of tender mercy to the pri&s;oner's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oul, induced her to &s;end prie&s;ts, who mole&s;ted her with perpetual di&s;putation; and even a reprieve of three days was granted her, in hopes that &s;he would be per&s;uaded, during that time, to pay, by a timely conver&s;ion to Popery, &s;ome regard to her eternal welfare. The Lady Jane had pre&s;ence of mind, in tho&s;e melancholy circum&s;tances, not only to defend her religion by &s;olid arguments, but al&s;o to write a letter to her &s;i&s;ter, in the Greek language; in which, be&s;ides &s;ending her a copy of the Scriptures in that tongue, &s;he exhorted her to maintain, in every fortune, a like &s;teady per&s;everance. On the day of her execution; her hu&s;band, Lord Guilford, de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee her; but &s;he refu&s;ed her con&s;ent, and &s;ent him word, that the tenderne&s;s of their parting would overcome the fortitude of both; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would too much unbend their minds from that con&s;tancy, which their approaching end required of them.&mdash;Their &s;eparation, &s;he &s;aid,
<PB N="36" REF="035851_0073_1007AAF9EF96FBC0">
would be only for a moment; and they would &s;oon rejoin each other in a &s;cene, where their affections would be for ever united; and where death, di&s;ap|pointment, and misfortunes, could no longer have ac|ce&s;s to them, or di&s;turb their eternal felicity.</P>
<P>It had been intended to execute the Lady Jane and Lord Guilford together on the &s;ame &s;caffold, at Tower-hill; but the council, dreading the compa&s;&s;ion of the people for their youth, beauty, innocence, and noble birth, changed their orders, and gave directions that &s;he &s;hould be beheaded within the verge of the Tower. She &s;aw her hu&s;band led to execution; and having given him from the window &s;ome token of her remembrance, &s;he waited with tranquillity till her own appointed hour &s;hould bring her to a like fate. She even &s;aw his headle&s;s body carried back in a cart; and found her&s;elf more confirmed by the reports, which &s;he heard of the con&s;tancy of his end, than &s;haken by &s;o tender and melancholy a &s;pectacle. Sir John Gage, con&s;table of the Tower, when he led her to execution, de&s;ired her to be&s;tow on him &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ent, which he might keep as a perpetual memorial of her. She gave him her table-book, in which &s;he had ju&s;t written three &s;entences, on &s;eeing her hu&s;band's dead body; one in Greek, another in Latin, a third in Engli&s;h. The purport of them was, "that human ju&s;tice was again&s;t his body, but the Divine Mercy would be favourable to his &s;oul: and that if her fault de&s;erved puni&s;hment, her youth, at lea&s;t, and her imprudence, were worthy of excu&s;e; and that God and po&s;terity, &s;he tru&s;ted, would &s;how her father." On the &s;caffold, &s;he made a &s;peech to the bye-&s;tanders, in which the mildne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition led her to take the blame
<PB N="37" REF="035851_0074_1007AAFDC0479FF0">
entirely on her&s;elf, without uttering one complaint again&s;t the &s;everity with which &s;he had been treated. She &s;aid, that her offence was, not having laid her hand upon the crown, but not rejecting it with &s;uf|ficient con&s;tancy: that &s;he had le&s;s erred through am|bition than through reverence to her parents, whom &s;he had been taught to re&s;pect and obey: that &s;he willingly received death, as the only &s;atisfaction which &s;he could now make to the injured &s;tate; and though her infringement of the laws had been con&s;trained, &s;he would &s;how, by her voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their &s;entence, that &s;he was de&s;irous to atone for that di&s;|obedience, into which too much filial piety had be|trayed her: that &s;he had ju&s;tly de&s;erved this puni&s;hment for being made the in&s;trument, though the unwilling in&s;trument, of the ambition of others: and that the &s;tory of her life, &s;he hoped, might at lea&s;t be u&s;eful, by proving that innocence excu&s;es not great mi&s;deeds, if they tend any way to the de&s;truction of the common|wealth.&mdash;After uttering the&s;e words, &s;he cau&s;ed her&s;elf to be di&s;robed by her women, and with a &s;teady, &s;erene countenance &s;ubmitted her&s;elf to the executioner.</P>

<P>IN that &s;ea&s;on of the year, when the &s;erenity of the &s;ky, the various fruits which cover the ground the di&s;coloured foliage of the trees, and all the &s;weet, but fading graces of in&s;piring autumn, open the mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

benevolence, and di&s;po&s;e it for contemplation, I was wandering in a beautiful and romantic country, till curio&s;ity began to give way to wearine&s;s; and I &s;at down on the fragment of a rock overgrown with mo&s;s; where the ru&s;tling of the falling leaves, the da&s;hing of waters, and the hum of the di&s;tant city, &s;oothed my mind into the mo&s;t perfect tranquillity; and &s;leep in|&s;en&s;ibly &s;tole upon me, as I was indulging the agree|able reveries, which the objects around me naturally in&s;pired.</P>
<P>I immediately found my&s;elf in a va&s;t extended plain, in the middle of which aro&s;e a mountain higher than I had before any conception of. It was covered with a multitude of people, chiefly youth; many of whom pre&s;&s;ed forward with the livelie&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of ardour in their countenance, though the way was in many places &s;teep and difficult. I ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who had but ju&s;t begun to climb the hill, thought them&s;elves not far from the top; but as they proceeded, new hills were continually ri&s;ing to their view: and the &s;ummit of the highe&s;t they could before di&s;cern &s;eemed but the foot of another, till the mountain at length appeared to lo&s;e it&s;elf in the clouds. As I was gazing on the&s;e things with a&s;toni&s;hment, a friendly in&s;tructer &s;uddenly appeared: "The mountain before thee," &s;aid he, "is the Hill of Science. On the top is the temple of Truth, who&s;e head is above the clouds, and a veil of pure light covers her face. Ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of her votaries; be &s;ilent and attentive."</P>
<P>After I had noticed a variety of objects, I turned my eye towards the multitudes who were climbing the &s;teep a&s;cent; and ob&s;erved among&s;t them a youth of a lively look, a piercing eye, and &s;omething fiery and
<PB N="39" REF="035851_0076_1007AB01E991F3D8">
irregular in all his motions. His name was Genius. He darted like an eagle up the mountain; and left his companions gazing after him with envy and admira|tion: but his progre&s;s was unequal, and interrupted by a thou&s;and caprices. When Plea&s;ure warbled in the valley, he mingled in her train. When Pride beckoned towards the precipice, he ventured to the tottering edge. He delighted in devious and untried paths; and made &s;o many excur&s;ions from the road, that his feebler companions often out&s;tripped him. I ob&s;erved that the Mu&s;es beheld him with partiality; but Truth often frowned and turned a&s;ide her face. While Genius was thus wa&s;ting his &s;trength in eccen|tric flights, I &s;aw a per&s;on of a very different appear|ance, named Application. He crept along with a &s;low and unremitting pace, his eyes fixed on the top of the mountain, patiently removing every &s;tone that ob|&s;tructed his way, till he &s;aw mo&s;t of tho&s;e below him, who had at fir&s;t derided his &s;low and toil&s;ome progre&s;s. Indeed, there were few who a&s;cended the hill with equal, and uninterrupted &s;teadine&s;s; for, be&s;ides the difficulties of the way, they were continually &s;olicited to turn a&s;ide, by a numerous crowd of Appetites, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Plea&s;ures, who&s;e importunity, when once complied with, they became le&s;s and le&s;s able to re&s;i&s;t: and though they often returned to the path, the a&s;perities of the road were more &s;everely felt; the hill appeared more &s;teep and rugged; the fruits which were whole&s;ome and refre&s;hing, &s;eemed har&s;h and ill-ta&s;ted; their &s;ight grew dim; and their feet tript at every little ob&s;truction.</P>
<P>I &s;aw, with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, that the Mu&s;es, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was to cheer and encourage tho&s;e who were

toiling up the a&s;cent, would often &s;ing in the bowers of Plea&s;ure, and accompany tho&s;e who were enticed away at the call of the Pa&s;&s;ions. They accompanied them, however, but a little way; and always for&s;ook them when they lo&s;t &s;ight of the hill. The tyrants then doubled their chains upon the unhappy captives; and led them away, without re&s;i&s;tance, to the cells of Ignorance, or the man&s;ions of Mi&s;ery. Among&s;t the innumerable &s;educers, who were endeavouring to draw away the votaries of Truth from the path of Science, there was one, &s;o little formidable in her ap|pearance, and &s;o gentle and languid in her attempts, that I &s;hould &s;carcely have taken notice of her, but for the numbers &s;he had imperceptibly loaded with her chains. Indolence, (for &s;o &s;he was called,) far from proceeding to open ho&s;tilities, did not attempt to turn their feet out of the path, but contented her&s;elf with retarding their progre&s;s; and the purpo&s;e &s;he could not force them to abandon, &s;he per&s;uaded them to delay. Her touch had a power like that of the torpedo, which withered the &s;trength of tho&s;e who came within its in|fluence. Her unhappy captives &s;till turned their faces towards the temple, and always hoped to arrive there; but the ground &s;eemed to &s;lide from beneath their feet, and they found them&s;elves at the bottom, before they &s;u&s;pected they had changed their place. The placid &s;erenity, which at fir&s;t appeared in their countenance, changed by degrees into a melancholy languor, which was tinged with deeper and deeper gloom, as they glided down the &s;tream of In&s;ignificance; a dark and &s;luggi&s;h water, which is curled by no breeze, and enlivened by no murmur, till it falls into a dead &s;ea, where &s;tartled pa&s;&s;engers are awakened by the &s;hock, and the next moment buried in the gulph of Oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="035851_0078_1007AB090EDFF008">
Of all the unhappy de&s;erters from the paths of Sci|ence, none &s;eemed le&s;s able to return than the follow|ers of Indolence. The captives of Appetite and Pa&s;|&s;ion, could often &s;eize the moment when their tyrants were languid or a&s;leep, to e&s;cape from their enchant|ment; but the dominion of Indolence was con&s;tant and unremitted; and &s;eldom re&s;i&s;ted, till re&s;i&s;tance was in vain.</P>
<P>After contemplating the&s;e things, I turned my eyes towards the top of the mountain, where the air was al|ways pure and exhilarating, the path &s;haded with lau|rels and other evergreens, and the effulgence which beamed from the face of Science, &s;eemed to &s;hed a glory round her votaries. Happy, &s;aid I, are they who are permitted to a&s;cend the mountain!&mdash;but while I was pronouncing this exclamation, with uncommon ardour, I &s;aw, &s;tanding be&s;ide me, a form of diviner features, and a more benign radiance. "Happier," &s;aid &s;he, "are they whom Virtue conducts to the man&s;ions of Content!" "What," &s;aid I, "does Virtue then re&s;ide in the vale?" "I am found," &s;aid &s;he, "in the vale, and I illuminate the mountain. I cheer the cottager at his toil, and in|&s;pire the &s;age at his meditation. I mingle in the crowd of cities, and ble&s;s the hermit in his cell. I have a tem|ple in every heart that owns my influence; and to him that wi&s;hes for me, I am already pre&s;ent. Science may rai&s;e thee to eminence, but I alone can guide thee to felicity!"&mdash;While Virtue was thus &s;peaking, I &s;tretched out my arms towards her, with a vehemence which broke my &s;lumber. The chill dews were falling around me, and the &s;hades of evening &s;tretched over the land|&s;cape. I ha&s;tened homeward; and re&s;igned the night to &s;ilence and meditation.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII. The Journey of a Day: a Picture of Human Life.</HEAD>
<P>OBIDAH, the &s;on of Aben&s;ina, left the caravan&s;era early in the morning, and pur&s;ued his journey through the plains of Indo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tan. He was fre&s;h and vigorous with re&s;t; he was animated with hope; he was incited by de&s;ire; he walked &s;wiftly forward over the vallies, and &s;aw the hills gradually ri&s;ing before him. As he pa&s;&s;ed along, his ears were delighted with the morning &s;ong of the bird of paradi&s;e; he was fanned by the la&s;t flutters of the &s;inking breeze, and &s;prinkled with dew by groves of &s;pices. He &s;ometimes contemplated the towering height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and &s;ometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primro&s;e, elde&s;t daughter of the &s;pring: all his &s;en&s;es were gra|tified, and all care was bani&s;hed from his heart.</P>
<P>Thus he went on, till the &s;un approached his meri|dian, and the increa&s;ing heat preyed upon his &s;trength; he then looked round about him for &s;ome more com|modious path. He &s;aw, on his right hand, a grove that &s;eemed to wave its &s;hades as a &s;ign of invitation; he entered it, and found the coolne&s;s and verdure irre&s;i&s;tibly plea&s;ant. He did not, however, forget whither he was travelling; but found a narrow way bordered with flowers which appeared to have the &s;ame direction with the main road; and was plea&s;ed, that, by this happy experiment, he had found means to unite plea&s;ure with bu&s;ine&s;s, and to gain the rewards of diligence without &s;uffering its fatigues. He, there|fore, &s;till continued to walk for a time, without the lea&s;t remi&s;&s;ion of his ardour, except that he was &s;ome|times
<PB N="43" REF="035851_0080_1007AB0DADF34E40">
tempted to &s;top by the mu&s;ic of the birds, which the heat had a&s;&s;embled in the &s;hade; and &s;ometimes amu&s;ed him&s;elf with plucking the flowers that covered the banks on either &s;ide, or the fruits that hung upon the branches. At la&s;t, the green path began to de|cline from its fir&s;t tendency, and to wind among hills and thickets, cooled with fountains, and murmuring with water-falls. Here Obidah pau&s;ed for a time, and began to con&s;ider whether it were longer &s;afe to for|&s;ake the known and common track; but remembering that the heat was now in its greate&s;t violence, and that the plain was du&s;ty and uneven, he re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the new path, which he &s;uppo&s;ed only to make a few meanders, in compliance with the varieties of the ground, and to end at la&s;t in the common road.</P>
<P>Having thus calmed his &s;olicitude, he renewed his pace, though he &s;u&s;pected that he was not gaining ground. This unea&s;ine&s;s of mind inclined him to lay hold on every new object, and give way to every &s;en&s;ation that might &s;ooth or divert him.

He was now rou&s;ed by his danger to a quick and painful remembrance of his folly; he now &s;aw how happine&s;s is lo&s;t when ea&s;e is con&s;ulted; he la|mented the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">manly impatience that prompted him to &s;eek &s;helter in the grove; and de&s;pi&s;ed the petty cu|rio&s;ity that led him on from trifle to trifle. While he was thus reflecting, the air grew blacker, and a clap of thunder broke his meditation.</P>
<P>He now re&s;olved to do what yet remained in his power, to tread back the ground which he had pa&s;&s;ed, and try to find &s;ome i&s;&s;ue where the wood might open into the plain. He pro&s;trated him&s;elf on the ground, and commended his life to the Lord of Nature. He ro&s;e with confidence and tranquillity, and pre&s;&s;ed on with re&s;olution. The bea&s;ts of the de&s;ert were in mo|tion, and on every hand were heard the mingled howls of rage and fear, and ravage and expiration. All the horrors of darkne&s;s and &s;olitude &s;urrounded him: the winds roared in the woods; and the torrents tumbled from the hills.</P>
<P>Thus forlorn and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, he wandered through the wild, without knowing whither he was going, or whether he was every moment drawing nearer to &s;afety or to de&s;truction. At length, not fear, but la|bour began to overcome him; his breath grew &s;hort, and his knees trembled; and he was on the point of lying down in re&s;ignation to his fate, when he beheld, through the brambles, the glimmer of a taper. He advanced towards the light; and finding that it pro|ceeded from the cottage of a hermit, he called humbly at the door, and obtained admi&s;&s;ion. The old man &s;et before him &s;uch provi&s;ions as he had collected for him&s;elf, on which Obidah fed with eagerne&s;s and gra|titude.</P>

When the repa&s;t was over, "Tell me," &s;aid the her|mit, "by what chance thou ha&s;t been brought hither? I have been now twenty years an inhabitant of the wilderne&s;s, in which I never &s;aw a man before."&mdash;Obidah then related the occurrences of his journey, without any concealment or palliation.</P>
<P>"Son," &s;aid the hermit, "let the errors and follies, the dangers and e&s;cape of this day, &s;ink deep into thy heart. Remember, my &s;on, that human life is the journey of a day.

In a &s;hort time, we remit our fervour, and endeavour to find &s;ome mitigation of our duty, and &s;ome more ea&s;y means of obtaining the &s;ame end. We then relax our vigour, and re&s;olve no longer to be terrified with crimes at a di&s;tance; but rely upon our own con&s;tancy, and venture to approach what we re&s;olve never to touch.

<HEAD>SECTION I. The Importance of a good Education.</HEAD>
<P>I CONSIDER a human &s;oul, without education, like marble in the quarry; which &s;hows none of its inherent beauties, until the &s;kill of the poli&s;her fetches out the colours, makes the &s;urface &s;hine, and di&s;covers every ornamental cloud, &s;pot, and vein that runs through the body of it. Education, after the &s;ame manner, when it works upon a noble mind, draws out to view every latent virtue and perfection, which, without &s;uch helps, are never able to make their appearance.</P>
<P>If my reader will give me leave to change the allu&s;ion &s;o &s;oon upon him, I &s;hall make u&s;e of the &s;ame in&s;tance to illu&s;trate the force of education, which Ari&s;totle has brought to explain his doctrine of &s;ub|&s;tantial forms, when he tells us, that a &s;tatue lies hid in a block of marble; and that the art of the &s;tatuary only clears away the &s;uperfluous matter, and removes the rubbi&s;h. The figure is in the &s;tone, and the &s;cul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">r only finds it. What &s;culpture is to a block of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, education is to a human &s;oul. The philo&s;opher, the &s;aint, or the hero, the wi&s;e, the good, or the great man, very often lies hid and concealed in a plebian, which a proper education might have di&s;interred, and have
<PB N="48" REF="035851_0085_1007AB1C4A03FED0">
brought to light. I am therefore much delighted with reading the accounts of &s;avage nations; and with con|templating tho&s;e virtues which are wild and uncul|tivated: to &s;ee courage exerting it&s;elf in fiercene&s;s, re&s;olution in ob&s;tinacy, wi&s;dom in cunning, patience in &s;ullenne&s;s and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Mens' pa&s;&s;ions operate variou&s;ly, and appear in dif|ferent kinds of actions, according as they are more or le&s;s rectified and &s;wayed by rea&s;on. When one hears of negroes, who upon the death of their ma&s;ters, or upon changing their &s;ervice, hang them&s;elves upon the next tree, as it &s;ometimes happens in our American plantations, who can forbear admiring their fidelity, though it expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf in &s;o dreadful a manner? What might not that &s;avage greatne&s;s of &s;oul, which appears in the&s;e poor wretches on many occa&s;ions, be rai&s;ed to, were it rightly cultivated? And what colour of excu&s;e can there be, for the contempt with which we treat this part of our &s;pecies; that we &s;hould not put them upon the common foot of humanity; that we &s;hould only &s;et an in&s;ignificant fine upon the man who murders them; nay, that we &s;hould as much as in us lies, cut them off from the pro&s;pects of happine&s;s in another world, as well as in this; and deny them that which we look upon as the proper means for at|taining it?</P>
<P>It is therefore an un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ing, to be born in tho&s;e parts of the world where wi&s;dom and knowledge flouri&s;h; though, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, there are, even in the&s;e parts, &s;everal poor unin&s;tructed per&s;ons, who are but little above the inhabitants of tho&s;e nations of which I have been here &s;peaking; as tho&s;e who have had the advantages of a more liberal education, ri&s;e

above one another by &s;everal different degrees of per|fection. For, to return to our &s;tatue in the block of marble, we &s;ee it &s;ometimes only begun to be chipped, &s;ometimes rough-hewn, and but ju&s;t &s;ketched into a human figure; &s;ometimes, we &s;ee the man appearing di&s;tinctly in all his limbs and features; &s;ometimes, we find the figure wrought up to great elegancy; but &s;eldom meet with any to which the hand of a Phidias or a Praxiteles could not give &s;everal nice touches and fini&s;hings.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. On Gratitude.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not a more plea&s;ing exerci&s;e of the mind, than gratitude. It is accompanied with &s;uch inward &s;atisfaction, that the duty is &s;ufficiently rewarded by the performance. It is not, like the practice of many other virtues, difficult and painful, but attended with &s;o much plea&s;ure, that were there no po&s;itive command which enjoined it, nor any recompen&s;e laid up for it hereafter, a generous mind would indulge in it, for the natural gratification which it affords.</P>
<P>If gratitude is due from man to man, how much more from man to his Maker?&mdash;The Supreme Being does not only confer upon us tho&s;e bounties which pro|ceed more immediately from his hand, but even tho&s;e benefits which are conveyed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by others. Every ble&s;&s;ing we enjoy, by what means &s;oever it may be derived upon us, is the gift of Him who is the great Author of good, and the Father of mercies.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. On Forgivene&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t plain and natural &s;entiments of equity concur with divine authority, to enforce the duty of forgivene&s;s. Let him who has never in his life done wrong, be allowed the privilege of remaining in|exorable. But let &s;uch as are con&s;cious of frailties and crimes, con&s;ider forgivene&s;s as a debt which they owe to others. Common failings are the &s;tronge&s;t le&s;&s;on of mutual forbearance. Were this virtue unknown among men, order and comfort, peace and repo&s;e, would be &s;trangers to human life. Injuries retaliated according to the exorbitant mea&s;ure which pa&s;&s;ion pre&s;cribes, would excite re&s;entment in return. The injured per&s;on would become the injurer; and thus wrongs, retaliations, and fre&s;h injuries, would circulate in endle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, till the world was rendered a field of blood. Of all the pa&s;&s;ions which invade the human brea&s;t, revenge is the mo&s;t direful. When al|lowed to reign with full dominion, it is more than &s;ufficient to poi&s;on the few plea&s;ures which remain to man in his pre&s;ent &s;tate. How much &s;oever a per&s;on may &s;uffer from inju&s;tice, he is always in hazard of &s;uffering more from the pro&s;ecution of revenge. The violence of an enemy cannot inflict what is equal to the
<PB N="51" REF="035851_0088_1007AB22D3555358">
torment he creates to him&s;elf, by means of the fierce and de&s;perate pa&s;&s;ions which he allows to rage in his &s;oul.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e evil &s;pirits who inhabit the regions of mi&s;ery, are repre&s;ented as delighting in revenge and cruelty. But all that is great and good in the univer&s;e, is on the &s;ide of clemency and mercy. The almighty Ruler of the world, though for ages offended by the unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and in&s;ulted by the impiety of men, is "long-&s;uffering and &s;low to anger." His Son, when he ap|peared in our nature, exhibited, both in his life, and his death, the mo&s;t illu&s;trious example of forgivene&s;s which the world ever beheld. If we look into the hi&s;tory of mankind, we &s;hall find that in every age, they who have been re&s;pected as worthy, or admired as great, have been di&s;tingui&s;hed for this virtue. Revenge dwells in little minds. A noble and magnanimous &s;pirit is always &s;uperior to it. It &s;uffers not from the injuries of men tho&s;e &s;evere &s;hocks which others feel. Collected within it&s;elf, it &s;tands unmoved by their im|potent a&s;&s;aults; and with generous pity, rather than with anger, looks down on their unworthy conduct.&mdash;It has been truly &s;aid, that the greate&s;t man on earth can no &s;ooner commit an injury, than a good man can make him&s;elf greater, by forgiving it.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. Motives to the Practice of Gentlene&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>To promote the virtue of gentlene&s;s, we ought to view our character with an impartial eye; and to learn, from our own failings, to give that indulgence
<PB N="52" REF="035851_0089_1007AB25A680EB18">
which in our turn we claim. It is pride which fills the world with &s;o much har&s;hne&s;s and &s;everity. In the fulne&s;s of &s;elf-e&s;timation, we forget what we are. We claim attentions, to which we are not entitled. We are rigorous to offences, as if we had never of|fended; unfeeling to di&s;tre&s;s, as if we know not what it was to &s;uffer. From tho&s;e airy regions of pride and folly, let us de&s;cend to our proper level. Let us &s;ur|vey the natural equality on which Providence has placed man with man, and reflect on the infirmities common to all. If the reflection on natural equality and mutual offences, be in&s;ufficient to prompt humani|ty, let us at lea&s;t remember what we are in the &s;ight of our Creator. Have we none of that forbearance to give one another, which we all &s;o earne&s;tly intreat from heaven? Can we look for clemency or gentlene&s;s from our Judge, when we are &s;o backward to &s;how it to our own brethren?</P>
<P>Let us al&s;o accu&s;tom our&s;elves, to reflect on the &s;mall moment of tho&s;e things, which are the u&s;ual in|centives to violence and contention. In the ruffled and angry hour, we view every appearance through a fal&s;e medium. The mo&s;t incon&s;iderable point of inte|re&s;t, or honour, &s;wells into a momentous object; and the &s;lighte&s;t attack &s;eems to threaten immediate ruin. But after pa&s;&s;ion or pride has &s;ub&s;ided, we look around in vain for the mighty mi&s;chiefs we dreaded. The fabric, which our di&s;turbed imagination had reared, totally di&s;appears. But though the cau&s;e of conten|tion has dwindled away, its con&s;equences remain. We have alienated a friend; we have embittered an enemy; we have &s;own the &s;eeds of future &s;u&s;picion, malevolence, or di&s;gu&s;t.&mdash;Let us &s;u&s;pend our violence

for a moment, when cau&s;es of di&s;cord occur. Let us anticipate that period of coolne&s;s, which, of it&s;elf, will &s;oon arrive. Let us reflect how little we have any pro&s;pect of gaining by fierce contention; but how much of the true happine&s;s of life we are certain of throwing away. Ea&s;ily, and from the &s;malle&s;t chink, the bitter waters of &s;trife are let forth; but their cour&s;e cannot be fore&s;een; and he &s;eldom fails of &s;uffering mo&s;t from their poi&s;onous effect, who fir&s;t allowed them to flow.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. A &s;u&s;picious Temper the Source of Mi&s;ery to its Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</HEAD>
<P>As a &s;u&s;picious &s;pirit is the &s;ource of many crimes and calamities in the world, &s;o it is the &s;pring of cer|tain mi&s;ery to the per&s;on who indulges it. His friends will be few; and &s;mall will be his comfort in tho&s;e whom he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. Believing others to be his ene|mies, he will of cour&s;e make them &s;uch. Let his cau|tion be ever &s;o great, the a&s;perity of his thoughts will often break out in his behaviour; and in return for &s;u&s;|pecting and hating, he will incur &s;u&s;picion and hatred. Be&s;ides the external evils which he draws upon him&s;elf, ari&s;ing from alienated friend&s;hip, broken confidence, and open enmity, the &s;u&s;picious temper it&s;elf is one of the wor&s;t evils which any man can &s;uffer. If "in all fear there is torment," how mi&s;erable mu&s;t be his &s;tate who, by living in perpetual jealou&s;y, lives in perpetual dread? Looking upon him&s;elf to be &s;urrounded with &s;pies, enemies, and de&s;igning men, he is a &s;tranger to reliance and tru&s;t. He knows not to whom to open

him&s;elf. He dre&s;&s;es his countenance in forced &s;miles, while his heart throbs within from apprehen&s;ions of &s;ecret treachery. Hence fretfulne&s;s and ill-humour, di&s;gu&s;t at the world, and all the painful &s;en&s;ations of an irritated and embittered mind.</P>
<P>So numerous and great are the evils ari&s;ing from a &s;u&s;picious di&s;po&s;ition, that, of the two extremes, it is more eligible to expo&s;e our&s;elves to occa&s;ional di&s;ad|vantage from thinking too well of others, than to &s;uffer continual mi&s;ery by thinking always ill of them. It is better to be &s;ometimes impo&s;ed upon, than never to tru&s;t. Safety is purcha&s;ed at too dear a rate, when, in order to &s;ecure it, we are obliged to be always clad in armour, and to live in perpetual ho&s;tility with our fellows. This is, for the &s;ake of living, to deprive our&s;elves of the comfort of life. The man of candour enjoys his &s;ituation, whatever it is, with cheerfulne&s;s and peace. Prudence directs his intercour&s;e with the world; but no black &s;u&s;picions haunt his hours of re&s;t. Accu&s;tomed to view the characters of his neighbours in the mo&s;t favourable light, he is like one who dwells amid&s;t tho&s;e beautiful &s;cenes of nature, on which the eye re&s;ts with plea&s;ure.

<HEAD>SECTION VI. Comforts of Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are many who have pa&s;&s;ed the age of youth and beauty; who have re&s;igned the plea&s;ures of that &s;miling &s;ea&s;on; who begin to decline into the vale of years, impaired in their health, depre&s;&s;ed in their fortunes, &s;tript of their friends, their children, and perhaps &s;till more tender connexions. What re&s;ource can this world afford them? It pre&s;ents a dark and dreary wa&s;te, through which there does not i&s;&s;ue a &s;ingle ray of comfort. Every delu&s;ive pro&s;pect of am|bition is now at an end; long experience of mankind, an experience very different from what the open and generous &s;oul of youth had fondly dreamt of, has ren|dered the heart almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible to new friend&s;hips. The principal &s;ources of activity are taken away, when tho&s;e for whom we labour are cut off from us; tho&s;e who animated, and tho&s;e who &s;weetened all the toils of life. Where then can the &s;oul find refuge, but in the bo&s;om of Religion? There &s;he is admitted to tho&s;e pro&s;pects of Providence and futurity, which alone can warm and fill the heart. I &s;peak here of &s;uch as retain the feelings of humanity; whom misfortunes have &s;oft|ened, and perhaps rendered more delicately &s;en&s;ible: not of &s;uch as po&s;&s;e&s;s that &s;tupid in&s;en&s;ibility, which &s;ome are plea&s;ed to dignify with the name of Philo|&s;ophy.</P>

have the humanity to con&s;ider the very different &s;itua|tion of the re&s;t of mankind; and not endeavour to de|prive them of what habit at lea&s;t, if they will not al|low it to be nature, has made nece&s;&s;ary to their mo|rals, and to their happine&s;s. It might be expected, that humanity would prevent them from breaking into the la&s;t retreat of the unfortunate, who can no longer be objects of their envy or re&s;entment; and tearing from them their only remaining comfort. The at|tempt to ridicule religion may be agreeable to &s;ome, by relieving them from re&s;traint upon their plea&s;ures: and may render others very mi&s;erable, by making them doubt tho&s;e truths, in which they were mo&s;t deeply intere&s;ted; but it can convey real good and happine&s;s to no one individual.</P>

As to new notions, and new doctrines, of which this age is very fruitful, the time will come, when we &s;hall have no plea&s;ure in them: nay, the time &s;hall come when they &s;hall be exploded, and would have been forgotten, if they had not been pre&s;erved in tho&s;e excellent books, which contain a confutation of them; like infects pre&s;erved for ages in amber, which otherwi&s;e would &s;oon have returned to the common ma&s;s of things. But a firm belief of Chri&s;tianity, and a practice &s;uitable to it, will &s;upport and invigorate the mind to the la&s;t; and mo&s;t of all, at la&s;t, at that important hour, which mu&s;t decide our hopes and apprehen&s;ions: and the wi&s;dom, which, like our Saviour, cometh from above, will, through his me|rits, bring us thither. All our other &s;tudies and pur|&s;uits, however different, ought to be &s;ub&s;ervient to, and centre in, this grand point, the pur&s;uit of eternal happine&s;s, by being good in our&s;elves, and u&s;eful to the world.</P>

and are to render account at the la&s;t. That portion of it which he has allotted us, is intended partly for the concerns of this world, partly for tho&s;e of the next. Let each of the&s;e occupy, in the di&s;tribution of our time, that &s;pace which properly belongs to it. Let not the hours of ho&s;pitality and plea&s;ure interfere with the di&s;charge of our nece&s;&s;ary affairs; and let not what we call nece&s;&s;ary affairs, encroach upon the time which is due to devotion. To every thing there is a &s;ea&s;on, and a time for every purpo&s;e under the heaven. If we delay till to-morrow what ought to be done to-day, we overcharge the morrow with a burden which belongs not to it. We load the wheels of time, and prevent them from carrying us along &s;moothly. He who every morning plans the tran&s;actions of the day, and follows out that plan, carries on a thread which will guide him through the labyrinth of the mo&s;t bu&s;y life. The orderly arrangement of his time is like a ray of light, which darts it&s;elf through all his affairs. But, where no plan is laid, where the di&s;po&s;al of time is &s;urrendered merely to the chance of incidents, all things lie huddled together in one chaos, which admits neither of di&s;tribution nor review.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t requi&s;ite for introducing order into the management of time, is to be impre&s;&s;ed with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of its value. Let us con&s;ider well how much de|pends upon it, and how fa&s;t it flies away. The bulk of men are in nothing more capricious and incon&s;i&s;tent, than in their appreciation of time. When they think of it, as the mea&s;ure of their continuance on earth, they highly prize it, and with the greate&s;t anxiety &s;eek to lengthen it out. But when they view it in &s;eparate parcels, they appear to hold it in contempt, and &s;quan|der
<PB N="59" REF="035851_0096_1007AB37B70A02F8">
it with incon&s;iderate profu&s;ion. While they com|plain that life is &s;hort, they are often wi&s;hing its dif|ferent periods at an end. Covetous of every other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, of time only they are prodigal. They allow every idle man to be ma&s;ter of this property, and make every frivolous occupation welcome that can help them to con&s;ume it. Among tho&s;e who are &s;o carele&s;s of time, it is not to be expected that order &s;hould be ob&s;erved in its di&s;tribution. But, by this fatal neglect, how many materials of &s;evere and la&s;ting regret are they laying up in &s;tore for them&s;elves! The time which they &s;uffer to pa&s;s away in the mid&s;t of confu|&s;ion, bitter repentance &s;eeks afterwards in vain to re|call. What was omitted to be done at its proper moment, ari&s;es to be the torment of &s;ome future &s;ea|&s;on. Manhood is di&s;graced by the con&s;equences of neglected youth. Old age, oppre&s;&s;ed by cares that belonged to a former period, labours under a burden not its own. At the clo&s;e of life, the dying man be|holds with angui&s;h that his days are fini&s;hing, when his preparation for eternity is hardly commenced. Such are the effects of a di&s;orderly wa&s;te of time, through not attending to its value. Every thing in the life of &s;uch per&s;ons is mi&s;placed. Nothing is performed aright, from not being performed in due &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>But he who is orderly in the di&s;tribution of his time, takes the proper method of e&s;caping tho&s;e manifold evils. He is ju&s;tly &s;aid to redeem the time. By pro|per management, he prolongs it. He lives much in little &s;pace; more in a few years than others do in many. He can live to God and his own &s;oul, and at the &s;ame time attend to all the lawful intere&s;ts of the pre&s;ent world. He looks back on the pa&s;t, and pro|vides

for the future. He catches and arre&s;ts the hours as they fly. They are marked down for u&s;eful pur|po&s;es, and their memory remains. Whereas tho&s;e hours fleet by the man of confu&s;ion like a &s;hadow. His days and years are either blanks of which he has no remembrance, or they are filled up with &s;uch a con|fu&s;ed and irregular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of unfini&s;hed tran&s;actions, that though he remembers he has been bu&s;y, yet he can give no account of the bu&s;ine&s;s which has em|ployed him.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IX. The Dignity of Virtue amid&s;t corrupt Examples.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t excellent and honourable character which can adorn a man and a Chri&s;tian, is acquired by re|&s;i&s;ting the torrent of vice, and adhering to the cau&s;e of God and virtue again&s;t a corrupted multitude. It will be found to hold in general, that all tho&s;e, who, in any of the great lines of life, have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for thinking profoundly, and acting nobly, have de|&s;pi&s;ed popular prejudices; and departed, in &s;everal things, from the common ways of the world. On no occa&s;ion is this more requi&s;ite for true honour, than where religion and morality are concerned. In times of prevailing licentiou&s;ne&s;s, to maintain unblemi&s;hed virtue, and uncorrupted integrity; in a public or a private cau&s;e, to &s;tand firm by what is fair and ju&s;t, amid&s;t di&s;couragements and oppo&s;ition; de&s;pi&s;ing groundle&s;s cen&s;ure and reproach; di&s;daining all com|pliance with public manners, when they are vicious and unlawful; and never a&s;hamed of the punctual
<PB N="61" REF="035851_0098_1007AB3DA9E03ED0">
di&s;charge of every duty towards God and man;&mdash;this is what &s;hows true greatne&s;s of &s;pirit, and will force approbation even from the degenerate multitude them|&s;elves. "This is the man," (their con&s;cience will oblige them to acknowledge,) "whom we are unable to bend to mean conde&s;cen&s;ions. We &s;ee it in vain either to flatter or to threaten him; he re&s;ts on a prin|ciple within, which we cannot &s;hake. To this man we may, on any occa&s;ion, &s;afely commit our cau&s;e. He is incapable of betraying his tru&s;t, or de&s;erting his friend, or denying his faith."</P>
<P>It is, accordingly, this &s;teady inflexible virtue, this regard to principle, &s;uperior to all cu&s;tom and opi|nion, which peculiarly marked the characters of tho&s;e in any age, who have &s;hone with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre; and has con&s;ecrated their memory to all po&s;terity. It was this that obtained to ancient Enoch the mo&s;t &s;in|gular te&s;timony of honour from heaven. He continued to "walk with God," when the world apo&s;tati&s;ed from him. He plea&s;ed God, and was beloved of him; &s;o that living among &s;inners, he was tran&s;lated to heaven without &s;eeing death; "Yea, &s;peedily was he taken away, le&s;t wickedne&s;s &s;hould have altered his under|&s;tanding, or deceit beguiled his &s;oul." When Sodom could not furni&s;h ten righteous men to &s;ave it, Lot re|mained un&s;potted amid&s;t the contagion. He lived like an angel among &s;pirits of darkne&s;s; and the de&s;troying flame was not permitted to go forth, till the good man was called away by a heavenly me&s;&s;enger from his devoted city. When "all fle&s;h had corrupted their way upon the earth," then lived Noah, a righteous man, and a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s. He &s;tood alone, and was &s;coffed by the profane crew. But they by

the deluge were &s;wept away; while on him, Provi|dence conferred the immortal honour, of being the re|&s;torer of a better race, and the father of a new world. Such examples as the&s;e, and &s;uch honours conferred by God on them who with&s;tood the multitude of evil doers, &s;hould often be pre&s;ent to our minds. Let us oppo&s;e them to the numbers of low and corrupt exam|ples, which we behold around us; and when we are in hazard of being &s;wayed by &s;uch, let us fortify our virtue, by thinking of tho&s;e who, in former times, &s;hone like &s;tars in the mid&s;t of &s;urrounding darkne&s;s, and are now &s;hining in the kingdom of heaven, as the brightne&s;s of the firmament, for ever and ever.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION X. The Mortifications of Vice greater than tho&s;e of Virtue.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH no condition of human life is free from unea&s;ine&s;s, yet it mu&s;t be allowed, that the unea&s;ine&s;s belonging to a &s;inful cour&s;e, is far greater, than what attends a cour&s;e of well-doing. If we are weary of the labours of virtue, we may be a&s;&s;ured, that the world, whenever we try the exchange, will lay upon us a much heavier load. It is the out&s;ide, only, of a licentious life, which is gay and &s;miling. Within, it conceals toil, and trouble, and deadly &s;orrow. For vice poi&s;ons human happine&s;s in the &s;pring, by intro|ducing di&s;order into the heart. Tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which it &s;eems to indulge, it only &s;eeds with imperfect grati|fications; and thereby &s;trengthens them for preying, in the end, on their unhappy victims.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="035851_0100_1007923B79C805D0">
It is a great mi&s;take to imagine, that the pain of &s;elf-denial is confined to virtue. He who follows the world, as much as he who follows Chri&s;t, mu&s;t "take up his cro&s;s;" and to him a&s;&s;uredly, it will prove a more oppre&s;&s;ive burden. Vice allows all our pa&s;&s;ions to range uncontrolled; and where each claims to be &s;uperior, it is impo&s;&s;ible to gratify all. The pre|dominant de&s;ire can only be indulged at the expen&s;e of its rival. No mortifications which virtue exacts, are more &s;evere than tho&s;e, which ambition impo&s;es upon the love of ea&s;e, pride upon intere&s;t, and covet|ou&s;ne&s;s upon vanity. Self-denial, therefore, belongs, in common, to vice and virtue; but with this remark|ble difference, that the pa&s;&s;ions which virtue requires us to mortify, it tends to weaken; whereas, tho&s;e which vice obliges us to deny, it, at the &s;ame time, &s;trengthens. The one dimini&s;hes the pain of &s;elf-denial, by moderating the demand of pa&s;&s;ion; the other in|crea&s;es it, by rendering tho&s;e demands imperious and violent. What di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that occur in the calm life of virtue, can be compared to tho&s;e tortures, which re|mor&s;e of con&s;cience inflicts on the wicked; to tho&s;e &s;evere humiliations, ari&s;ing from guilt combined with misfortunes, which &s;ink them to the du&s;t; to tho&s;e violent agitations of &s;hame and di&s;appointment, which &s;ometimes drive them to the mo&s;t fatal extremities, and make them abhor their exi&s;tence? How often, in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e di&s;a&s;trous &s;ituations, into which their crimes have brought them, have they execrated the &s;eductions of vice; and, with bitter regret, looked back to the day on which they fir&s;t for&s;ook the path of innocence!</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XI. On Contentment.</HEAD>
<P>CONTENTMENT produces, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, all tho&s;e effects which the alchymi&s;t u&s;ually a&s;cribes to what he calls the philo&s;opher's &s;tone; and if it does not bring riches, it does the &s;ame thing by bani&s;hing the de&s;ire of them. If it cannot remove the di&s;quietudes ari&s;ing from a man's mind, body, or fortune, it makes him ea&s;y under them. It has indeed a kindly influence on the &s;oul of man, in re&s;pect of every being to whom he &s;tands related. It extingui&s;hes all murmur, repining, and ingratitude, towards that Being who has allotted him his part to act in this world. It de&s;troys all in|ordinate ambition, and every tendency to corruption, with regard to the community wherein he is placed. It gives &s;weetne&s;s to his conver&s;ation, and a perpetual &s;erenity to all his thoughts.</P>
<P>Among the many methods which might be made u&s;e of for acquiring this virtue, I &s;hall mention only the two following. Fir&s;t of all, a man &s;hould always con|&s;ider how much he has more than he wants; and &s;econdly, how much more unhappy he might be than he really is.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, a man &s;hould always con&s;ider how much he has more than he wants. I am wonderfully plea&s;ed with the reply which Ari&s;tippus made to one, who con|doled him upon the lo&s;s of a farm: "Why," &s;aid he, "I have three farms &s;till, and you have but one; &s;o that I ought rather to be afflicted for you than you for me." On the contrary, fooli&s;h men are more apt to con&s;ider what they have lo&s;t, than what they po&s;&s;e&s;s;
<PB N="65" REF="035851_0102_10079243688031D0">
and to fix their eyes upon tho&s;e who are richer than them&s;elves, rather than on tho&s;e who are under greater difficulties. All the real plea&s;ures and conveniences of life lie in a narrow compa&s;s; but it is the humour of mankind to be always looking forward; and &s;training after one who has got the &s;tart of them in wealth and honour. For this rea&s;on, as none can be properly called rich, who have not more than they want, there are few rich men in any of the politer nations, but among the middle &s;ort of people, who keep their wi&s;hes within their fortunes, and have more wealth than they know how to enjoy. Per&s;ons of a higher rank live in a kind of &s;plendid poverty; and are per|petually wanting, becau&s;e, in&s;tead of acquie&s;cing in the &s;olid plea&s;ures of life, they endeavour to outvie one another in &s;hadows and appearances. Men of &s;en&s;e have at all times behold, with a great deal of mirth, this &s;illy game that is playing over their heads; and, by contracting their de&s;ires, enjoy all that &s;ecret &s;atisfaction which others are always in que&s;t of. The truth is, this ridiculous cha&s;e after imaginary plea&s;ures, cannot be &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed, as it is the great &s;ource of tho&s;e evils which generally undo a nation. Let a man's e&s;tate be what it may, he is a poor man, if he does not live within it; and naturally &s;ets him&s;elf to &s;ale to any one that can give him his price. When Pittacus, after the death of his brother, who had left him a good e&s;tate, was offered a great &s;um of money by the king of Lydia, he thanked him for his kindne&s;s; but told him, he had already more by half than he knew what to do with. In &s;hort, content is equivalent to wealth, and luxury to poverty; or, to give the thought a more agreeable turn, "Content is natural wealth,"
<PB N="66" REF="035851_0103_100792590BAFE1E0">
&s;ays Socrates; to which I &s;hall add, Luxury is artificial poverty. I &s;hall therefore recommend to the con|&s;ideration of tho&s;e, who are always aiming at &s;uper|fluous and imaginary enjoyments, and who will not be at the trouble of contracting their de&s;ires, an excellent &s;aying of Bion the philo&s;opher, namely, "That no man has &s;o much care, as he who endeavours after the mo&s;t happine&s;s."</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, every one ought to reflect how much more unhappy he might be, than he really is.&mdash;The former con&s;ideration took in all tho&s;e, who are &s;ufficiently provided with the means to make them|&s;elves ea&s;y; this regards &s;uch as actually lie under &s;ome pre&s;&s;ure or misfortune. The&s;e may receive great alleviation, from &s;uch a compari&s;on as the unhappy per&s;on may make between him&s;elf and others; or be|tween the misfortune which he &s;uffers, and greater misfortunes which might have befallen him.</P>
<P>I like the &s;tory of the hone&s;t Dutchman, who, upon breaking his leg by a fall from the main-ma&s;t, told the &s;tanders-by, it was a great mercy that it was not his neck. To which, &s;ince I am got into quotations, give me leave to add the &s;aying of an old philo&s;opher, who, after having invited &s;ome of his friends to dine with him, was ruffled by a per&s;on that came into the room in a pa&s;&s;ion, and threw down the table that &s;tood be|fore them: "Every one," &s;ays he, "has his calamity; and he is a happy man that has no greater than this." We find an in&s;tance to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, in the life of Doctor Hammond, written by Bi&s;hop Fell. As this good man was troubled with a complication of di&s;|tempers, when he had the gout upon him, he u&s;ed to thank God that it was not the &s;tone; and when he had
<PB N="67" REF="035851_0104_1007925D5B55B610">
the &s;tone, that he had not both the&s;e di&s;tempers on him at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this e&s;&s;ay without ob&s;erving, that there never was any &s;y&s;tem be&s;ides that of Chri&s;tianity, which could effectually produce in the mind of man the virtue I have been hitherto &s;peaking of. In order to make us contented with our condition, many of the pre&s;ent philo&s;ophers tell us, that our di&s;content only hurts our&s;elves, without being able to make any altera|tion in our circum&s;tances; others, that whatever evil befalls us is derived to us by a fatal nece&s;&s;ity, to which &s;uperior beings them&s;elves are &s;ubject; while others, very gravely, tell the man who is mi&s;erable, that it is nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be &s;o, to keep up the harmony of the univer&s;e; and that the &s;cheme of Providence would be troubled and perverted, were he otherwi&s;e. The&s;e, and the like con&s;iderations, rather &s;ilence than &s;atisfy a man. They may &s;how him that his di&s;content is unrea&s;onable, but they are by no means &s;ufficient to relieve it. They rather give de&s;pair than con&s;olation. In a word, a man might reply to one of the&s;e comforters, as Au|gu&s;tus did to his friend, who advi&s;ed him not to grieve for the death of a per&s;on whom he loved, becau&s;e his grief could not fetch him again: "It is for that very rea&s;on," &s;aid the emperour, "that I gri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">."</P>
<P>On the contrary, religion bears a more tender re|gard to human nature. It pre&s;cribes to every mi&s;er|able man the means of bettering his condition: nay, it &s;hows him, that bearing his afflictions as he ought to do, will naturally end in the removal of them. It makes him ea&s;y here, becau&s;e it can make him happy hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XII. Rank and Riches afford no Ground for Envy.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the grounds of envy among men, &s;uperiority in rank and fortune is the mo&s;t general. Hence, the malignity which the poor commonly bear to the rich, as engro&s;&s;ing to them&s;elves all the comforts of life. Hence, the evil eye with which per&s;ons of inferior &s;ta|tion &s;crutini&s;e tho&s;e who are above them in rank; and if they approach to that rank, their envy is generally &s;tronge&s;t again&s;t &s;uch as are ju&s;t one &s;tep higher than them&s;elves.&mdash;Alas! my friends, all this envious di&s;quie|tude, which agitates the world, ari&s;es from a deceitful figure which impo&s;es on the public view. Fal&s;e co|lours are hung out; the real &s;tate of men is not what it &s;eems to be. The order of &s;ociety requires a di&s;tinc|tion of ranks to take place; but in point of happine&s;s, all men come much nearer to equality than is commonly imagined; and the circum&s;tances, which form any ma|terial difference of happine&s;s among them, are not of that nature which renders them grounds of envy. The poor man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not, it is true, &s;ome of the conveni|ences and plea&s;ures of the rich; but, in return, he is free from many embarra&s;&s;ments to which they are &s;ubject. By the &s;implicity and uniformity of his life, he is deli|vered from that variety of cares, which perplex tho&s;e who have great affairs to manage, intricate plans to pur&s;ue, many enemies, perhaps, to encounter in the pur&s;uit. In the tranquillity of his &s;mall habitation, and private family, he enjoys a peace which is often un|known at courts. The gratifications of nature, which are always the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by him
<PB N="69" REF="035851_0106_10079263252F8800">
to their full extent; and if he be a &s;tranger to the re|fined plea&s;ures of the wealthy, he is unacquainted al&s;o with the de&s;ire of them, and by con&s;equence, feels no want. His plain meal &s;atisfies his appetite, with a reli&s;h, probably, higher than that of the rich man, who &s;its down to his luxurious banquet. His &s;leep is more found; his health more firm; he knows not what &s;pleen, languor, and liftle&s;sne&s;s are. His accu&s;tomed employments or labours are not more oppre&s;&s;ive to him, than the labour of attendance on courts and the great, the labours of dre&s;s, the fatigue of amu&s;ements, the very weight of idlene&s;s, frequently are to the rich. In the mean time, all the beauty of the face of nature, all the enjoyments of dome&s;tic &s;ociety, all the gaiety and cheerfulne&s;s of an ea&s;y mind, are as open to him as to tho&s;e of the highe&s;t rank. The &s;plendour of re|tinue, the found of titles, the appearances of high re|&s;pect, are indeed &s;oothing, for a &s;hort time, to the great. But, become familiar, they are &s;oon forgotten. Cu&s;tom effaces their impre&s;&s;ion. They &s;ink into the rank of tho&s;e ordinary things, which daily recur, without rai&s;|ing any &s;en&s;ation of joy.&mdash;Let us cea&s;e, therefore, from looking up with di&s;content and envy to tho&s;e, whom birth or fortune has placed above us. Let us adju&s;t the balance of happine&s;s fairly. When we think of the enjoyments we want, we &s;hould think al&s;o of the troubles from which we are free. If we allow their ju&s;t value to the comforts we po&s;&s;e&s;s, we &s;hall find rea|&s;on to re&s;t &s;atisfied, with a very moderate, though not an opulent and &s;plendid, condition of fortune.

Every man is marked by &s;ome peculiarity which di&s;tingui&s;hes him from another: and no where can two individuals be found, who are exactly, and in all re&s;pects, alike. Where &s;o much diver&s;ity obtains, it cannot but happen, that, in the intercour&s;e which men are obliged to maintain, their tempers &s;hall often be ill adju&s;ted to that intercour&s;e; &s;hall jar, and inter|fere with each other. Hence, in every &s;tation, the highe&s;t as well as the lowe&s;t, and in every condition of life, public, private, and dome&s;tic, occa&s;ions of irrita|tion frequently ari&s;e. We are provoked, &s;ometimes, by the folly and levity of tho&s;e with whom we are connected; &s;ometimes, by their indifference or neglect; by the incivility of a friend, the haughtine&s;s of a &s;upe|rior, or the in&s;olent behaviour of one in lower &s;tation. Hardly a day pa&s;&s;es, without &s;omewhat or other oc|curring, which &s;erves to ruffle the man of impatient &s;pirit. Of cour&s;e, &s;uch a man lives in a continual &s;torm. He knows not what it is to enjoy a train of good humour. Servants, neighbours, friends, &s;pou&s;e, and children, all, through the unre&s;trained violence of his temper, become &s;ources of di&s;turbance and vexation to him. In vain is affluence; in vain are health and pro&s;perity. The lea&s;t trifle is &s;ufficient to di&s;compo&s;e his mind, and poi&s;on his plea&s;ures. His very amu&s;e|ments are mixed with turbulence and pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="035851_0108_10079268E9AF18C8">
I would be&s;eech this man to con&s;ider, of what &s;mall moment the provocations which he receives, or at lea&s;t imagines him&s;elf to receive, are really in them&s;elves; but of what great moment he makes them, by &s;uffering them to deprive him of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf. I would be&s;eech him, to con&s;ider, how many hours of happine&s;s he throws away, which a little more pa|tience would allow him to enjoy; and how much he puts it in the power of the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant per&s;ons to render him mi&s;erable. "But who can expect," we hear him exclaim, "that he is to po&s;&s;e&s;s the in&s;en&s;ibi|lity of a &s;tone? How is it po&s;&s;ible for human nature to endure &s;o many repeated provocations? or to bear calmly with &s;uch unrea&s;onable behaviour?"&mdash;My bro|ther! if thou can&s;t bear with no in&s;tances of unrea&s;ona|ble behaviour, withdraw thy&s;elf from the world. Thou art no longer fit to live in it. Leave the intercour&s;e of men. Retreat to the mountain, and the de&s;ert; or &s;hut thy&s;elf up in a cell. For here, in the mid&s;t of &s;ociety, <HI>offences mu&s;t come.</HI> We might as well expect, when we beheld a calm atmo&s;phere, and a clear &s;ky, that no clouds were ever to ri&s;e, and no winds to blow, as that our life was long to proceed, without receiving provocations from human frailty. The carele&s;s and the imprudent, the giddy and the fickle, the ungrate|ful and the intere&s;ted, every where meet us. They are the briers and thorns, with which the paths of hu|man life are be&s;et. He only, who can hold his cour&s;e among them with patience and equanimity, he who is prepared to bear what he mu&s;t expect to happen, is worthy of the name of a man.</P>
<P>If we pre&s;erved our&s;elves compo&s;ed but for a mo|ment, we &s;hould perceive the in&s;ignificancy of mo&s;t of
<PB N="72" REF="035851_0109_1007926D1B96CA38">
tho&s;e provocations which we magnify &s;o highly. When a few &s;uns more have rolled over our heads, the &s;torm will, of it&s;elf, have &s;ub&s;ided; the cau&s;e of our pre&s;ent impatience and di&s;turbance will be utterly forgotten. Can we not then, anticipate this hour of calmne&s;s to our&s;elves; and begin to enjoy the peace which it will certainly bring? If others have behaved improperly, let us leave them to their own folly, without becoming the victim of their caprice, and puni&s;hing our&s;elves on their account.&mdash;Patience, in this exerci&s;e of it, cannot be too much &s;tudied by all who wi&s;h their life to flow in a &s;mooth &s;tream. It is the rea&s;on of a man, in op|po&s;ition to the pa&s;&s;ion of a child. It is the enjoyment of peace, in oppo&s;ition to uproar and confu&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIV. Moderation in our Wi&s;hes recommended.</HEAD>
<P>THE active mind of man &s;eldom or never re&s;ts &s;atis|fied with its pre&s;ent condition, how pro&s;perous &s;oever. Originally formed for a wider range of objects, for a higher &s;phere of enjoyments, it finds it&s;elf, in every &s;ituation of fortune, &s;traitened and confined. Sen&s;ible of deficiency in its &s;tate, it is ever &s;ending forth the fond de&s;ire, the a&s;piring wi&s;h, after &s;omething beyond what is enjoyed at pre&s;ent. Hence, that re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s which prevails &s;o generally among mankind. Hence, that di&s;gu&s;t of plea&s;ures which they have tried; that pa&s;&s;ion for novelty; that ambition of ri&s;ing to &s;ome degree of eminence or felicity, of which they have formed to them&s;elves an indi&s;tinct idea. All which
<PB N="73" REF="035851_0110_1007926EA11FF718">
may be con&s;idered as indications of a certain native, original greatne&s;s in the human &s;oul, &s;welling beyond the limits of its pre&s;ent condition; and pointing at the higher objects for which it was made. Happy, if the&s;e latent remains of our primitive &s;tate, &s;erved to direct our wi&s;hes towards their proper de&s;tination, and to lead us into the path of true bli&s;s!"</P>
<P>But in this dark and bewildered &s;tate, the a&s;piring tendency of our nature unfortunately takes an oppo|&s;ite direction, and feeds a very mi&s;placed ambition. The flattering appearances which here pre&s;ent them|&s;elves to &s;en&s;e; the di&s;tinctions which fortune confers; the advantages and plea&s;ures which we imagine the world to be capable of be&s;towing, fill up the ultimate wi&s;h of mo&s;t men. The&s;e are the objects which in|gro&s;s their &s;olitary mu&s;ings, and &s;timulate their active labours; which warm the brea&s;ts of the young, animate the indu&s;try of the middle aged, and often keep alive the pa&s;&s;ions of the old, until the very clo&s;e of life.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;uredly, there is nothing unlawful in our wi&s;hing to be freed from whatever is di&s;agreeable, and to ob|tain a fuller enjoyment of the comforts of life. But when the&s;e wi&s;hes are not tempered by rea&s;on, they are in danger of precipitating us into much extrava|gance and folly. De&s;ires and wi&s;hes are the fir&s;t &s;prings of action. When they become exorbitant, the whole character is likely to be tainted. If we &s;uffer our fancy to create to it&s;elf worlds of ideal happine&s;s, we &s;hall di&s;compo&s;e the peace and order of our minds, and foment many hurtful pa&s;&s;ions. Here, then, let Moderation begin its reign; by bringing within rea|&s;onable bounds the wi&s;hes that we form. As &s;oon as they become extravagant, let us check them, by pro|per

reflections on the fallacious nature of tho&s;e objects, which the world hangs out to allure de&s;ire.</P>
<P>You have &s;trayed, my friends, from the road which conducts to felicity; you have di&s;honoured the native dignity of your &s;ouls, in allowing your wi&s;hes to ter|minate on nothing higher than worldly ideas of great|ne&s;s or happine&s;s. Your imagination roves in a land of &s;hadows. Unreal forms deceive you. It is no more than a phantom, an illu&s;ion of happine&s;s, which at|tracts your fond admiration; nay, an illu&s;ion of happi|ne&s;s, which often conceals much real mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Do you imagine, that all are happy, who have at|tained to tho&s;e &s;ummits of di&s;tinction, towards which your wi&s;hes a&s;pire? Alas! how frequently has experi|ence &s;hown, that where ro&s;es were &s;uppo&s;ed to bloom, nothing but briers and thorns grew? Reputation, beauty, riches, grandeur, nay, royalty it&s;elf, would, many a time, have been gladly exchanged by the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors, for that more quiet and humble &s;tation, with which you are now di&s;&s;atisfied. With all that is &s;plen|did and &s;hining in the world, it is decreed that there &s;hould mix many deep &s;hades of woe. On the eleva|ted &s;ituations of fortune, the great calamities of life chiefly fall. There, the &s;torm &s;pends its violence, and there, the thunder breaks; while, &s;afe and unhurt, the inhabitant of the vale remains below.&mdash;Retreat, then, from tho&s;e vain and pernicious excur&s;ions of extrava|gant de&s;ire. Satisfy your&s;elves with what is rational and attainable. Train your minds to moderate views of human life, and human happine&s;s. Remember, and admire, the wi&s;dom of Agar's petition: "Remove far from me vanity and lies. Give me neither poverty nor riches. Feed me with food convenient for me:

<HEAD>SECTION XV. Omni&s;cience and Omnipre&s;ence of the Deity, the Source of Con&s;olation to good Men.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS ye&s;terday, about &s;un-&s;et, walking in the open fields, till the night in&s;en&s;ibly fell upon me. I at fir&s;t amu&s;ed my&s;elf with all the richne&s;s and variety of co|lours, which appeared in the we&s;tern parts of heaven. In proportion as they faded away and went out, &s;eve|ral &s;tars and planets appeared one after another, till the whole firmament was in a glow. The bluene&s;s of the ether was exceedingly heightened and enlivened, by the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and the rays of all tho&s;e lu|minaries that pa&s;&s;ed through it. The galaxy appeared in its mo&s;t beautiful white. To complete the &s;cene, the full moon ro&s;e, at length, in that clouded maje&s;ty, which Milton takes notice of; and opened to the eye a new picture of nature, which was more finely &s;haded, and di&s;po&s;ed among &s;ofter lights than that which the &s;un had before di&s;covered to us.</P>
<P>As I was &s;urveying the moon walking in her bright|ne&s;s, and taking her progre&s;s among the con&s;tellations, a thought aro&s;e in me, which I believe very often per|plexes and di&s;turbs men of &s;erious and contemplative natures. David him&s;elf fell into it in that reflection: "When I con&s;ider the heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and the &s;tars which thou ha&s;t or|dained; what is man that thou art mindful of him, and
<PB N="76" REF="035851_0113_1007932C535B42E0">
the &s;on of man that thou regarde&s;t him!" In the &s;ame manner, when I con&s;idered that infinite ho&s;t of &s;tars, or, to &s;peak more philo&s;ophically, of &s;uns, which were then &s;hining upon me; with tho&s;e innumerable &s;ets of planets or worlds, which were moving round their re|&s;pective &s;uns; when I &s;till enlarged the idea, and &s;up|po&s;ed another heaven of &s;uns and worlds, ri&s;ing &s;till above this which we di&s;covered; and the&s;e &s;till en|lightened by a &s;uperior firmament of luminaries, which are planted at &s;o great a di&s;tance, that they may ap|pear to the inhabitants of the former, as the &s;tars do to us; in &s;hort, while I pur&s;ued this thought, I could not but reflect on that little in&s;ignificant figure, which I my&s;elf bore amid&s;t the immen&s;ity of God's works.</P>
<P>Were the &s;un, which enlightens this part of the creation, with all the ho&s;t of planetary worlds that move about him, utterly extingui&s;hed and annihilated, they would not be mi&s;&s;ed, more than a grain of &s;and upon the &s;ea-&s;hore. The &s;pace they po&s;&s;e&s;s is &s;o ex|ceedingly little in compari&s;on of the whole, it would &s;carcely make a blank in the creation. The cha&s;m would be imperceptible to an eye, that could take in the whole compa&s;s of nature, and pa&s;s from one end of the creation to the other; as it is po&s;&s;ible there may be &s;uch a &s;en&s;e in our&s;elves hereafter, or in creatures which are at pre&s;ent more exalted than our&s;elves. By the help of gla&s;&s;es, we &s;ee many &s;tars, which we do not di&s;cover with our naked eyes; and the finer our tele&s;copes are, the more &s;till are our di&s;coveries.&mdash;Huygenius carries this thought &s;o far, that he does not think it impo&s;&s;ible there may be &s;tars, who&s;e light has not yet travelled down to us, &s;ince their fir&s;t creation. There is no que&s;tion that the univer&s;e has certain
<PB N="77" REF="035851_0114_1007939FF00810F8">
bounds &s;et to it; but when we con&s;ider that it is the work of infinite Power, prompted by infinite Good|ne&s;s, with an infinite &s;pace to exert it&s;elf in, how can our imagination &s;et any bounds to it?</P>
<P>To return, therefore, to my fir&s;t thought, I could not but look upon my&s;elf with &s;ecret horror, as a being that was not worth the &s;malle&s;t regard of one who had &s;o great a work under his care and &s;uperintendency. I was afraid of being overlooked amid&s;t the immen&s;ity of nature; and lo&s;t among that infinite variety of crea|tures, which, in all probability, &s;warm through all the&s;e immea&s;urable regions of matter.</P>
<P>In order to recover my&s;elf from this mortifying thought, I con&s;idered that it took its ri&s;e from tho&s;e narrow conceptions, which we are apt to entertain of the Divine nature. We our&s;elves cannot attend to ma|ny different objects at the &s;ame time. If we are care|ful to in&s;pect &s;ome things, we mu&s;t of cour&s;e neglect others. This imperfection which we ob&s;erve in our|&s;elves, is an imperfection that cleaves, in &s;ome degree, to creatures of the highe&s;t capacities, as they are creatures, that is, beings of finite and limited natures. The pre&s;ence of every created being is confined to a certain mea&s;ure of &s;pace; and con&s;equently his ob&s;er|vation is &s;tinted to a certain number of objects. The &s;phere in which we move, and act, and under&s;tand, is of a wider circumference to one creature, than another, according as we ri&s;e one above another in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence. But the wide&s;t of the&s;e our &s;pheres has its circumference. When, therefore, we reflect on the Divine nature, we are &s;o u&s;ed and accu&s;tomed to this imperfection in our&s;elves, that we cannot forbear, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a&s;cribing it to HIM, in whom there is no
<PB N="78" REF="035851_0115_100793A2C970ABF8">
&s;hadow of imperfection. Our rea&s;on indeed a&s;&s;ures us, that his attributes are infinite; but the poorne&s;s of our conceptions is &s;uch, that it cannot forbear &s;etting bounds to every thing it contemplates, till our rea&s;on comes again to our &s;uccour, and throws down all tho&s;e little prejudices, which ri&s;e in us unawares, and are natural to the mind of man.</P>
<P>We &s;hall therefore utterly extingui&s;h this melancholy thought, of our being overlooked by our Maker, in the multiplicity of his works, and the infinity of tho&s;e ob|jects among which he &s;eems to be ince&s;&s;antly employed, if we con&s;ider, in the fir&s;t place, that he is omnipre&s;ent; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the &s;econd, that he is omni&s;cient.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider him in his omnipre&s;ence, his being pa&s;&s;es through, actuates, and &s;upports, the whole frame of nature. His creation, and every part of it, is full of him. There is nothing he has made, that is either &s;o di&s;tant, &s;o little, or &s;o incon&s;iderable, which he does not e&s;&s;entially inhabit. His &s;ub&s;tance is within the &s;ub&s;tance of every being, whether material or imma|terial, and as intimately pre&s;ent to it, as that being is to it&s;elf. It would be an imperfection in him, were he able to move out of one place into another; or to withdraw him&s;elf from any thing he has created, or from any part of that &s;pace which he diffu&s;ed and &s;pread abroad to infinity. In &s;hort, to &s;peak of him in the language of the old philo&s;ophers, he is a being who&s;e centre is every where, and his circumference no where.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, he is omni&s;cient as well as om|nipre&s;ent. His omni&s;cience indeed nece&s;&s;arily and na|turally flows from his omnipre&s;ence. He cannot but be con&s;cious of every motion that ari&s;es in the whole
<PB N="79" REF="035851_0116_100793A7BB128348">
material world, which he thus e&s;&s;entially pervades; and of every thought that is &s;tirring in the intellectual world, to every part of which he is thus intimately united. Were the &s;oul &s;eparate from the body, and with one glance of thought &s;hould &s;tart beyond the bounds of the creation; &s;hould it, for millions of years, continue its progre&s;s through infinite &s;pace, with the &s;ame activity, it would &s;till find it&s;elf within the em|brace of its Creator, and encompa&s;&s;ed by the immen&s;ity of the Godhead.</P>
<P>In this con&s;ideration of the Almighty's omnipre&s;ence and omni&s;cience, every uncomfortable thought va|ni&s;hes. He cannot but regard every thing that has being, e&s;pecially &s;uch of his creatures who &s;ear they are not regarded by him. He is privy to all their thoughts, and to that anxiety of heart in particular, which is apt to trouble them on this occa&s;ion: for, as it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould overlook any of his creatures, &s;o we may be confident that he regards, with an eye of mercy, tho&s;e who endeavour to recommend them|&s;elves to his notice; and, in unfeigned humility of heart, think them&s;elves unworthy that he &s;hould be mindful of them.</P>

<P>ALL men pur&s;ue good, and would be happy, if they knew how: not happy for minutes, and mi&s;erable for hours; but happy, if po&s;&s;ible, through every part of their exi&s;tence. Either, therefore, there is a good of this &s;teady, durable kind, or there is not. If not, then all good mu&s;t be tran&s;ient and uncertain; and if &s;o, an object of the lowe&s;t value, which can little de&s;erve our attention or inquiry. But if there be a better good, &s;uch a good as we are &s;eeking; like every other thing, it mu&s;t be derived from &s;ome cau&s;e; and that cau&s;e mu&s;t either be external, internal, or mixed; in as much as, except the&s;e three, there is no other po&s;&s;ible. Now a &s;teady, durable good, cannot be derived from an external cau&s;e; &s;ince all derived from externals mu&s;t fluctuate as they fluctuate. By the &s;ame rule, it cannot be derived from a mixture of the two; becau&s;e the part which is external, will proportionably de&s;troy its e&s;&s;ence.

<P>I FIND my&s;elf exi&s;ting upon a little &s;pot, &s;urrounded every way by an immen&s;e unknown expan&s;ion.&mdash;Where am I? What &s;ort of a place do I inhabit! Is it exactly accommodated in every in&s;tance to my con|venience? Is there no exce&s;s of cold, none of heat, to offend me? Am I never annoyed by animals, either of my own, or a different kind?

The world appears not, then, originally made for the private convenience of the alone?&mdash;It does not. But is it not po&s;&s;ible &s;o to accommodate it, by my own particular indu&s;try? If to accommodate man and bea&s;t, heaven and earth, if this be beyond me, it is not po&s;&s;ible. What con&s;equence then follows; or can there be any other than this&mdash;If I &s;eek an intere&s;t of my own detached from that of others, I &s;eek an intere&s;t which is chimerical, and which can never have exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>How then mu&s;t I determine? Have I no intere&s;t at all? If I have not, I am &s;tationed here to no purpo&s;e. But why no intere&s;t? Can I be contented with none but one &s;eparate and detached?

The bee, the beaver, and the tribes of herding animals, are &s;ufficient to convince me, that the thing is &s;omewhere at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible.

<P>But, farther &s;till&mdash;I &s;top not here&mdash;I pur&s;ue this &s;ocial intere&s;t as far as I can trace my &s;everal relations.

<P>Again&mdash;I mu&s;t have food and cloathing. Without a proper genial warmth, I in&s;tantly peri&s;h.

Were this order once confounded, I could not probably &s;urvive a moment; &s;o ab&s;olutely do I depend on this common general welfare. What, then, have I to do, but to enlarge virtue into piety! Not only honour and ju&s;tice, and what I owe to man, is my intere&s;t; but gratitude al&s;o, acquie&s;cence, re&s;ignation, adoration, and all I owe to this great polity, and its great Governour our common Parent.</P>

al&s;o, in it&s;elf, unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t. In order to form &s;ound opinions concerning characters and actions, two things are e&s;pecially requi&s;ite, information and impartiality. But &s;uch as are mo&s;t forward to decide unfavourably, are commonly de&s;titute of both. In&s;tead of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, or even requiring, full information, the grounds on which they proceed are frequently the mo&s;t &s;light and frivolous.

From an action they pre&s;ently look into the heart, and infer the motive. This &s;uppo&s;ed motive they conclude to be the ruling principle; and pronounce at once concern|ing the whole character.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more contrary both to equity and to &s;ound rea&s;on, than &s;uch precipitate judgments. Any man who attends to what pa&s;&s;es within him&s;elf, may ea&s;ily di&s;cern what a complicated &s;y&s;tem the human character is; and what a variety of circum&s;tances mu&s;t be taken into the account, in order to e&s;timate it truly. No &s;ingle in&s;tance of conduct whatever, is &s;ufficient to determine it. As from one worthy action, it were credulity, not charity, to conclude a per&s;on to be free from all vice; &s;o from one which is cen&s;urable, it is per|fectly unju&s;t to infer that the author of it is without con&s;cience, and without merit. If we knew all the attending circum&s;tances, it might appear in an excu|&s;able light; nay, perhaps, under a commendable form. The motives of the actor may have been entirely diffe|rent
<PB N="84" REF="035851_0121_100793B9EDD6F858">
from tho&s;e which we a&s;cribe to him; and where we &s;uppo&s;e him impelled by bad de&s;ign, he may have been prompted by con&s;cience and mi&s;taken principle. Ad|mitting the action to have been in every view crimi|nal, he may have been hurried into it through inad|vertency and &s;urpri&s;e. He may have &s;incerely repented; and the virtuous principle may have now regained its full vigour. Perhaps this was the corner of frailty; the quarter on which he lay open to the incur&s;ions of temptation; while the other avenues of his heart were firmly guarded by con&s;cience.</P>
<P>It is therefore evident, that no part of the govern|ment of temper de&s;erves attention more, than to keep our minds pure from uncharitable prejudices, and open to candour and humanity in judging of others.&mdash;The wor&s;t con&s;equences, both to our&s;elves and to &s;ociety, follow from the oppo&s;ite &s;pirit.</P>

<P>WE find man placed in a world, where he has by no means the di&s;po&s;al of the events that happen. Ca|lamities &s;ometimes befall the worthie&s;t and the be&s;t, which it is not in their power to prevent, and where nothing is left them, but to acknowledge and to &s;ub|mit to the high hand of Heaven.

though tho&s;e unavoidable calamities make a part, yet they make not the chief part, of the vexations and &s;or|rows that di&s;tre&s;s human life.

Has he duly valued the ble&s;&s;ing of health, and always ob&s;erved the rules of virtue and &s;obriety? Has he been moderate in his life, and temperate in all his plea&s;ures? If now he is only paying the price of his former, perhaps his forgotten, indulgences, has he any title to complain, as if he were &s;uffering unju&s;tly? Were we to &s;urvey the chambers of &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, we &s;hould often find them peo|pled with the victims of intemperance and &s;en&s;uality, and with the children of vitious indolence and &s;loth. Among the thou&s;ands who langui&s;h there, we &s;hould find the proportion of innocent &s;ufferers to be &s;mall. We &s;hould &s;ee faded youth, premature old age, and the pro&s;pect of an untimely grave, to be the portion of multitudes who, in one way or other, have brought tho&s;e evils on them&s;elves; while yet the&s;e martyrs of vice and folly have the a&s;&s;urance to arraign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he hard fate of man, and to "fret again&s;t the Lord.</P>

which you &s;uffer, and the di&s;couragements under which you labour; of the cro&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments of which your life has been doomed to be full.&mdash;Be|fore you give too much &s;cope to your di&s;content, let me de&s;ire you to reflect impartially upon your pa&s;t train of life. Have not &s;loth, or pride, or ill temper, or &s;in|ful pa&s;&s;ions, mi&s;led you often from the path of &s;ound and wi&s;e conduct? Have you not been wanting to your|&s;elves in improving tho&s;e opportunities which Provi|dence offered you, for bettering and advancing your &s;tate?

It is certain, that the world &s;eldom turns wholly again&s;t a man, unle&s;s through his own fault. "Reli|gion is," in general, "profitable unto all things." Virtue, diligence, and indu&s;try, joined with good temper and prudence, have ever been found the &s;ure&s;t road to pro&s;|perity; and where men fail of attaining it, their want of &s;ucce&s;s is far oftener owing to their having deviated from that road, than to their having encountered in&s;u|perable bars in it. Some, by being too artful, forfeit the reputation of probity. Some, by being too open, are accounted to fail in prudence. Others, by being &s;ickle and changeable, are di&s;tru&s;ted by all.&mdash;The ca&s;e
<PB N="87" REF="035851_0124_100793C2CD3A1008">
commonly is, that men &s;eek to a&s;cribe their di&s;appoint|ments to any cau&s;e, rather than to their own mi&s;con|duct; and when they can devi&s;e no other cau&s;e, they lay them to the charge of Providence. Their folly leads them into vices; their vices into misfortunes; and in their misfortunes they "murmur again&s;t Providence." They are doubly unju&s;t towards their Creator. In their pro&s;perity, they are apt to a&s;cribe their &s;ucce&s;s to their own diligence, rather than to his ble&s;&s;ing; and in their adver&s;ity, they impute their di&s;tre&s;&s;es to his providence, not to their own mi&s;behaviour. Whereas, the truth is the very rever&s;e of this. "Every good and every perfect gift cometh from above;" and of evil and mi&s;ery, man is the author to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When from the condition of individuals, we look abroad to the public &s;tate of the world, we meet with more proofs of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion.

We &s;ee mighty armies going forth, in formidable array, again&s;t each other, to cover the earth with blood, and to fill the air with the cries of widows and orphans. Sad evils the&s;e are, to which this mi&s;erable world is expo&s;ed.&mdash;But are the&s;e evils, I be&s;eech you, to be imputed to God? Was it he who &s;ent forth &s;laughtering armies into the field, or who filled the peaceful city with ma&s;&s;acres and blood? Are the&s;e mi&s;eries any other, than the bit|ter fruit of men's violent and di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions? Are they not clearly to be traced to the ambition and vices of princes, to the quarrels of the great, and to the tur|bulence of the people?&mdash;Let us lay them entirely out of the account, in thinking of Providence; and let us think only of the "fooli&s;hne&s;s of man."

<HEAD>SECTION V. On di&s;intere&s;ted Friend&s;hip.</HEAD>
<P>I AM informed that certain Greek writers (philo&s;o|phers, it &s;eems, in the opinion of their countrymen) have advanced &s;ome very extraordinary po&s;itions re|lating to friend&s;hip; as, indeed, what &s;ubject is there, which the&s;e &s;ubtle geniu&s;es have not tortured with their &s;ophi&s;try?</P>
<P>The authors to whom I refer, di&s;&s;uade their di&s;ciples from entering into any &s;trong attachments, as unavoid|ably creating &s;upernumerary di&s;quietudes to tho&s;e who engage in them; and, as every man has more than &s;uffi|cient to call forth his &s;olicitude, in the cour&s;e of his own affairs, it is a weakne&s;s they contend, anxiou&s;ly to in|volve him&s;elf in the concerns of others. They recom|mend it al&s;o, in all connexions of this kind, to hold the bands of union extremely loo&s;e; &s;o as always to have it in one's power to &s;traiten or relax them, as circum&s;tances and &s;ituations &s;hall render mo&s;t expe|dient. They add, as a capital article of their doctrine, that, "to live exempt from cares, is an e&s;&s;ential in|gredient
<PB N="89" REF="035851_0126_100793C716E1C9C0">
to con&s;titute human happine&s;s: but an ingre|dient, however, which he, who voluntarily di&s;tre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with cares, in which he has no nece&s;&s;ary and per&s;onal intere&s;t, mu&s;t never hope to po&s;&s;e&s;s."</P>
<P>I have been told likewi&s;e, that there is another &s;et of pretended philo&s;ophers, of the &s;ame country, who&s;e tenets, concerning this &s;ubject, are of a &s;till more illi|beral and ungenerous ca&s;t.</P>
<P>The propo&s;ition they attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h, is, that "friend&s;hip is an affair of &s;elf-intere&s;t entirely; and that the proper motive for engaging in it, is, not in order to gratify the kind and benevolent affections, but for the benefit of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport which is to be derived from the connexion." Accordingly they a&s;&s;ert, that tho&s;e per&s;ons are mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to have recour&s;e to auxiliary alliances of this kind, who are lea&s;t qualified by nature, or fortune, to depend upon their own &s;trength and powers: the weaker &s;ex, for in&s;tance, being generally more inclined to engage in friend&s;hips, than the male part of our &s;pecies; and tho&s;e who are depre&s;&s;ed by indigence, or labouring under misfortunes, than the wealthy and the pro&s;|perous.</P>
<P>Excellent and obliging &s;ages, the&s;e, undoubtedly! To &s;trike out the friendly affections from the moral world, would be like extingui&s;hing the &s;un in the na|tural: each of them being the &s;ource of the be&s;t and mo&s;t grateful &s;atisfactions, that Heaven has conferred on the &s;ons of men. But I &s;hould be glad to know, what the real value of this boa&s;ted exemption from care, which they promi&s;e their di&s;ciples, ju&s;tly amounts to? an exemption flattering to &s;elf-love, I confe&s;s; but which upon many occurrences in human life, &s;hould
<PB N="90" REF="035851_0127_100793C9DDB020D0">
be rejected with the utmo&s;t di&s;dain. For nothing, &s;urely, can be more incon&s;i&s;tent with a well-poi&s;ed and manly &s;pirit, than to decline engaging in any laudable action, or to be di&s;couraged from per&s;evering in it, by an apprehen&s;ion of the trouble and &s;olicitude, with which it may probably be attended. Virtue her&s;elf, indeed, ought to be totally renounced, if it be right to avoid every po&s;&s;ible means that may be productive of unea&s;ine&s;s: for who, that is actuated by her principles, can ob&s;erve the conduct of an oppo&s;ite character, with|out being affected with &s;ome degree of &s;ecret di&s;&s;atis|faction? Are not the ju&s;t, the brave, and the good, nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed to the di&s;agreeable emotions of di&s;like and aver&s;ion, when they re&s;pectively meet with in&s;tances of fraud, of cowardice, or of villainy? It is an e&s;&s;ential property of every well con&s;tituted mind, to be affected with pain, or plea&s;ure, according to the nature of tho&s;e moral appearances that pre&s;ent them|&s;elves to ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>If &s;en&s;ibility, therefore, be not incompatible with true wi&s;dom, (and it &s;urely is not, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e that philo&s;ophy deadens every finer feeling of our na|ture,) what ju&s;t rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why the &s;ym|pathetic &s;ufferings which may re&s;ult from friend&s;hip, &s;hould be a &s;ufficient inducement for bani&s;hing that ge|nerous affection from the human brea&s;t? Extingui&s;h all emotions of the heart, and what difference will remain, I do not &s;ay between man and brute, but between man and a mere inanimate clod? Away then with tho&s;e au&s;tere philo&s;ophers, who repre&s;ent virtue as harden|ing the &s;oul again&s;t all the &s;ofter impre&s;&s;ions of huma|nity! The fact, certainly, is much otherwi&s;e. A truly good man is, upon many occa&s;ions, extremely &s;u&s;|ceptible
<PB N="91" REF="035851_0128_100793CC91CD28D0">
of tender &s;entiments; and his heart expands with joy, or &s;hrinks with &s;orrow, as good or ill fortune accompanies his friend. Upon the whole, then, it may fairly be concluded, that, as in the ca&s;e of virtue, &s;o in that of friend&s;hip, tho&s;e painful &s;en&s;ations, which may &s;ometimes be produced by the one, as well as by the other, are equally in&s;ufficient grounds for excluding either of them from taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our bo&s;oms.</P>
<P>They who in&s;i&s;t that "utility is the fir&s;t and prevail|ing motive, which induces mankind to enter into par|ticular friend&s;hips," appear to me to dive&s;t the a&s;&s;oci|ation of its mo&s;t amiable and engaging principle. For, to a mind right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;po&s;ed, it is not &s;o much the bene|fits received, as the affectionate zeal from which they flow, that gives them their be&s;t and mo&s;t valuable re|commendation. It is &s;o far indeed from being verified by fact, that a &s;en&s;e of our wants is the original cau&s;e of forming the&s;e amicable alliances; that, on the con|trary, it is ob&s;ervable, that none have been more di&s;|tingui&s;hed in their friend&s;hips than tho&s;e, who&s;e power and opulence, but, above all, who&s;e &s;uperior virtue (a much firmer &s;upport) have rai&s;ed them above every nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others.</P>
<P>The true di&s;tinction, then, in this que&s;tion is, that "although friend&s;hip is certainly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ductive of utility, yet utility is not the primary motive of friend&s;hip." Tho&s;e &s;elfi&s;h &s;en&s;uali&s;ts, therefore, who, lulled in the lap of luxury, pre&s;ume to maintain the rever&s;e, have &s;urely no claim to attention; as they are neither quali|fied by reflection, nor experience, to be competent judges of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Is there a man upon the face of the earth, who would deliberately accept of all the wealth, and all the afflu|ence

<HEAD>SECTION VI. On the Immortality of the Soul.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS ye&s;terday walking alone, in one of my friend's woods; and lo&s;t my&s;elf in it very agreeably, as I was running over, in my mind, the &s;everal arguments that e&s;tabli&s;h this great point; which is the ba&s;is of mo|rality, and the &s;ource of all the plea&s;ing hopes and &s;e|cret joys, that can ari&s;e in the heart of a rea&s;onable creature. I con&s;idered tho&s;e &s;everal proofs drawn,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, from the nature of the &s;oul it&s;elf, and parti|cularly its immateriality; which, though not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the eternity of its duration, has, I think, been evinced to almo&s;t a demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>Secondly, from its pa&s;&s;ions and &s;entiments; as, par|ticularly, from its love of exi&s;tence; its horror of an|nihilation; and its hopes of immortality; with that &s;e|cret &s;atisfaction which it finds in the practice of virtue; and that unea&s;ine&s;s which follows upon the commi&s;&s;ion of vice.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="035851_0130_100793D36E6CDB70">
Thirdly, from the nature of the Supreme Being, who&s;e ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom and veracity, are all concerned in this point.</P>
<P>But among the&s;e, and other excellent arguments for the immortality of the &s;oul, there is one drawn from the perpetual progre&s;s of the &s;oul to its perfection, without a po&s;&s;ibility of ever arriving at it; which is a hint that I do not remember to have &s;een opened and improved by others, who have written on this &s;ubject, though it &s;eems to me to carry a very great weight with it. How can it enter into the thoughts of man, that the &s;oul, which is capable of &s;uch immen&s;e perfections, and of receiving new improvements to all eternity, &s;hall fall away into nothing, almo&s;t as &s;oon as it is created? Are &s;uch abilities made for no purpo&s;e? A brute arrives at a point of perfection, that he can never pa&s;s: in a few years he has all the endowments he is capable of; and were he to live ten thou&s;and more, would be the &s;ame thing he is at pre&s;ent. Were a hu|man &s;oul thus at a &s;tand in her accompli&s;hments; were her faculties to be full blown, and incapable of farther enlargements; I could imagine &s;he might fall away in|&s;en&s;ibly, and drop at once into a &s;tate of annihilation. But can we believe a thinking being, that is in a perpetual progre&s;s of improvements, and travelling on from perfection to perfection, after having ju&s;t looked abroad into the works of its Creator, and made a few di&s;coveries of his infinite goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom, and power, mu&s;t peri&s;h at her fir&s;t &s;etting out, and in the very beginning of her inquiries?</P>
<P>A man, con&s;idered only in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, &s;eems &s;ent into the world merely to propagate his kind. He provides him&s;elf with a &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and immediately quits
<PB N="94" REF="035851_0131_100793D538D721D8">
his po&s;t to make room for him. He does not &s;eem born to enjoy life, but to deliver it down to others. This is not &s;urpri&s;ing to con&s;ider in animals, which are formed for our u&s;e, and can fini&s;h their bu&s;ine&s;s in a &s;hort life. The &s;ilk-worm, after having &s;pun her ta&s;k, lays her eggs and dies. But a man cannot take in his full mea|&s;ure of knowledge, has not time to &s;ubdue his pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;tabli&s;h his &s;oul in virtue, and come up to the per|fection of his nature, before he is hurried off the &s;tage. Would an infinitely wi&s;e Being make &s;uch glorious creatures for &s;o mean a purpo&s;e? Can he delight in the production of &s;uch abortive intelligences, &s;uch &s;hort-lived rea&s;onable beings? Would he give us ta|lents that are not to be exerted? capacities that are never to be gratified? How can we find that wi&s;dom which &s;hines through all his works, in the formation of man, without looking on this world as only a nur&s;ery for the next; and without believing that the &s;everal ge|nerations of rational creatures, which ri&s;e up and di&s;ap|pear in &s;uch quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, are only to receive their fir&s;t rudiments of exi&s;tence here, and afterwards to be tran&s;planted into a more friendly climate, where they may &s;pread and flouri&s;h to all eternity?</P>
<P>There is not, in my opinion, a more plea&s;ing and triumphant con&s;ideration in religion, than this of the perpetual progre&s;s, which the &s;oul makes towards the perfection of its nature, without ever arriving at a pe|riod in it. To look upon the &s;oul as going on from &s;trength to &s;trength; to con&s;ider that &s;he is to &s;hine for ever with new acce&s;&s;ions of glory, and brighten to all eternity; that &s;he will be &s;till adding virtue to virtue, and knowledge to knowledge; carries in it &s;omething wonderfully agreeable to that ambition, which is natural
<PB N="95" REF="035851_0132_100793D93B0494E0">
to the mind of man. Nay, it mu&s;t be a pro&s;pect plea&s;ing to God him&s;elf, to &s;ee his creation for ever beautifying in his eyes; and drawing nearer to him, by greater degrees of re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>Methinks this &s;ingle con&s;ideration, of the progre&s;s of a finite &s;pirit to perfection, will be &s;ufficient to ex|tingu&s;h all envy in inferior natures, and all contempt in &s;uperior. That cherub, which now appears as a god to a human &s;oul, knows very well, that the period will come about in eternity, when the human &s;oul &s;hall be as perfect as he him&s;elf now is: nay, when &s;he &s;hall look down upon that degree of perfection as much as &s;he now falls &s;hort of it. It is true, the higher nature &s;till advances, and by that means pre&s;erves his di&s;tance and &s;uperiority in the &s;cale of being; but he knows that how high &s;oever the &s;tation is of which he &s;tands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at pre&s;ent, the inferior nature will at length mount up to it; and &s;hine forth in the &s;ame degree of glory.</P>
<P>With what a&s;toni&s;hment and veneration, may we look into our own &s;ouls, where there are &s;uch hidden &s;tores of virtue and knowledge, &s;uch inexhau&s;ted &s;ources of perfection! We know not yet what we &s;hall be; nor will it ever enter into the heart of man, to conceive the glory that will be always in re&s;erve for him. The &s;oul, con&s;idered with its Creator, is like one of tho&s;e mathematical lines, that may draw nearer to another for all eternity, without a po&s;&s;ibility of touching it: and can there be a thought &s;o tran&s;port|ing, as to con&s;ider our&s;elves in the&s;e perpetual ap|proaches to HIM, who is the &s;tandard not only of per|fection, but of happine&s;s!</P>

<P>AMONG the great ble&s;&s;ings and wonders of the creation, may be cla&s;&s;ed the regularities of times and &s;ea&s;ons. Immediately after the flood, the &s;acred pro|mi&s;e was made to man, that &s;eed-time and harve&s;t, cold and heat, &s;ummer and winter, day and night, &s;hould continue to the very end of all things. Accor|dingly, in obedience to that promi&s;e, the rotation is con&s;tantly pre&s;enting us with &s;ome u&s;eful and agree|able alteration; and all the plea&s;ing novelty of life ari&s;es from the&s;e natural changes: nor are we le&s;s in|debted to them for many of its &s;olid comforts. It has been frequently the ta&s;k of the morali&s;t and poet, to mark, in poli&s;hed periods, the particular charms and conveniences of every change; and, indeed, &s;uch di&s;|criminate ob&s;ervations upon natural variety, cannot be undelightful; &s;ince the ble&s;&s;ing, which every month brings along with it, is a fre&s;h in&s;tance of the wi&s;dom and bounty of that Providence, which regulates the glories of the year. We glow as we contemplate; we feel a propen&s;ity to adore, whil&s;t we enjoy. In the time of &s;eed-&s;owing, it is the &s;ea&s;on of <HI>confidence:</HI> the grain which the hu&s;bandman tru&s;ts to the bo&s;om of the

earth &s;hall, haply, yield its &s;even-fold rewards. Spring pre&s;ents us with a &s;cene of lively <HI>expectation.</HI> That which was before &s;own begins now to di&s;cover &s;igns of &s;ucce&s;sful vegetation. The labourer ob&s;erves the change, and anticipates the harve&s;t: he watches the progre&s;s of nature, and &s;miles at her influence; while the man of contemplation walks forth with the even|ing, amid&s;t the fragrance of flowers, and promi&s;es of plenty; nor returns to his cottage till darkne&s;s clo&s;es the &s;cene upon his eye. Then cometh the harve&s;t, when the large wi&s;h is &s;atisfied, and the granaries of nature are loaded with the means of life, even to a luxury of abundance. The powers of language are unequal to the de&s;cription of this happy &s;ea&s;on. It is the carnival of nature: &s;un and &s;hade, coolne&s;s and quietude, cheerfulne&s;s and melody, love and gratitude, unite to render every &s;cene of &s;ummer delightful.&mdash;The divi&s;ion of light and darkne&s;s is one of the kinde&s;t efforts of Omnipotent Wi&s;dom. Day and night yield us contrary ble&s;&s;ings; and, at the &s;ame time, a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, by giving fre&s;h lu&s;tre to the delights of both. Amid&s;t the glare of day, and bu&s;tle of life, how could we &s;leep? Amid&s;t the gloom of darkne&s;s, how could we labour?</P>
<P>How wi&s;e, how benignant, then, is the proper divi|&s;ion! The hours of light are adapted to activity; and tho&s;e of darkne&s;s, to re&s;t. Ere the day is pa&s;&s;ed, ex|erci&s;e and nature prepare us for the pillow; and by the time that the morning returns, we are again able to meet it with a &s;mile. Thus, every &s;ea&s;on has a charm peculiar to it&s;elf; and every moment affords &s;ome intere&s;ting innovation.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. The Cataract of Niagara in Canada, North America.</HEAD>
<P>THIS amazing fall of water is made by the River St. Lawrence, in its pa&s;&s;age from lake Erie into the lake Ontario. The St. Lawrence is one of the large&s;t rivers in the world; and yet the whole of its waters are here poured down, by a fall of a hundred and fifty feet perpendicular. It is not ea&s;y to bring the imagi|nation to corre&s;pond to the greatne&s;s of the &s;cene. A river extremely deep and rapid, and that &s;erves to drain the waters of almo&s;t all North America into the Atlantic Ocean, is here poured precipitately down a ledge of rocks, that ri&s;es, like a wall, acro&s;s the whole bed of its &s;tream. The river, a little above, is near three quarters of a mile broad; and the rocks, where it grows narrower, are four hundred yards over. Their direction is not &s;traight acro&s;s, but hollowing inwards like a hor&s;e-&s;hoe: &s;o that the cataract, which bends to the &s;hape of the ob&s;tacle, rounding inwards, pre|&s;ents a kind of theatre the mo&s;t tremendous in nature. Ju&s;t in the middle of this circular wall of waters, a little i&s;land, that has braved the fury of the current, pre|&s;ents one of its points, and divides the &s;tream at top into two parts; but they unite again long before they reach the bottom. The noi&s;e of the fall is heard at the di&s;|tance of &s;everal leagues; and the fury of the waters, at the termination of their fall, is inconceivable. The da&s;h|ing produces a mi&s;t that ri&s;es to the very clouds; and which forms a mo&s;t beautiful rainbow, when the &s;un &s;hines.

<HEAD>SECTION III. The Grotto of Antiparos.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the &s;ubterraneous caverns now known, the grotto of Antiparos is the mo&s;t remarkable, as well for its extent, as for the beauty of its &s;parry incru&s;ta|tions. This celebrated cavern was fir&s;t explored by one Magni, an Italian traveller, about a hundred years ago, at Antiparos, an incon&s;iderable i&s;land of the Ar|chipelago. "Having been informed," &s;ays he, "by the natives of Paros, that in the little i&s;land of Anti|paros, which lies about two miles from the former, of a gigantic &s;tatue that was to be &s;een at the mouth of a cavern in that place, it was re&s;olved that we (the French Con&s;ul and him&s;elf) &s;hould pay it a vi&s;it. In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution, after we had landed on the i&s;land, and walked about four miles through the mid&s;t of beautiful plains, and &s;loping woodlands, we at length came to a little hill, on the &s;ide of which yawned a mo&s;t horrid cavern, that with its gloom at fir&s;t &s;truck us with terror, and almo&s;t repre&s;&s;ed curio|&s;ity. Recovering the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, however, we en|tered boldly; and had not proceeded above twenty paces, when the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tatue of the giant pre&s;ented it&s;elf to our view. We quickly perceived, that what the ignorant natives had been terrified at as a giant, was nothing more than a &s;parry concretion, formed by the water dropping from the roof of the cave, and by -deg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> hardening into a figure, which their fears had
<PB N="100" REF="035851_0137_100793E6B8715B28">
formed into a mon&s;ter. Incited by this extraordinary appearance, we were induced to proceed &s;till further, in que&s;t of nev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ventures in this &s;ubterranean abode. As we proceeded, new wonders offered them&s;elves; the &s;pars, formed into trees and &s;hruos, pre&s;ented a kind of petrified grove; &s;ome white, &s;ome green; and all receding in due per&s;pective. They &s;truck us with the more amazement, as we knew them to be mere productions of Nature, who, hitherto in &s;olitude, had, in her playful moments, dre&s;&s;ed the &s;cene, as if for her own amu&s;ement."</P>
<P>"We had as yet &s;een but a few of the wonders of the place; and we were introduced only into the portico of this amazing temple. In one corner of this half illuminated rece&s;s, there appeared an opening of about three feet wide, which &s;eemed to lead to a place to|tally dark, and which one of the natives a&s;&s;ured us contained nothing more than a re&s;ervoir of water. Upon this information, we made an experiment, by throwing down &s;ome &s;tones, which rumbling along the &s;ides of the de&s;cent for &s;ome time, the &s;ound &s;eemed at la&s;t qua&s;hed in a bed of water. In order, however, to be more certain, we &s;ent in a Levantine mariner, who, by the promi&s;e of a good reward, with a flambeau in his land, ventured into this narrow aperture. After continuing within it for about a quarter of an hour, he returned, bearing in his hand, &s;ome beautiful pieces of white &s;par, which art could neither imitate nor equal. Upon being informed by him that the place was full of the&s;e beautiful incru&s;tations, I ventured in once more with him, about fifty paces, anxiou&s;ly and cautiou&s;ly de&s;cending by a &s;teep and dangerous way. Finding, however, that we came to a precipice which led into

a &s;pacious amphitheatre, (if I may &s;o call it,) &s;till deeper than any other part, we returned, and being provided with a ladder, flambeau, and other things to expedite our de&s;cent, our whole company, man by man, ventured into the &s;ame opening; and de&s;cending one after another, we at la&s;t &s;aw our&s;elves all together in the mo&s;t magnificent part of the cavern."</P>

<P>"OUR candles being now all lighted up, and the whole place completely illuminated, never could the eye be pre&s;ented with a more glittering, or a more magnificent &s;cene. The whole roof hung with &s;olid icicles, tran&s;parent as gla&s;s, yet &s;olid as marble. The eye could &s;carcely reach the lofty and noble cieling; the &s;ides were regularly formed with &s;pars; and the whole pre&s;ented the idea of a magnificent theatre, il|luminated with an immen&s;e profu&s;ion of lights. The floor con&s;i&s;ted of &s;olid marble: and, in &s;everal places, magnificent columns, thrones, altars, and other objects, appeared, as if nature had de&s;igned to mock the cu|rio&s;ities of art. Our voices, upon &s;peaking or &s;inging, were redoubled to an a&s;toni&s;hing loudne&s;s; and upon the firing of a gun, the noi&s;e and reverberations were almo&s;t deafening. In the mid&s;t of this grand amphi|theatre ro&s;e a concretion of about fifteen feet high, that, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re&s;embled an altar; from which, taking the hint, we cau&s;ed ma&s;s to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> there.

objects repre&s;ented the cu&s;tomary ornaments of this rite."</P>
<P>"Below even this &s;pacious grotto there &s;eemed another cavern; down which I ventured with my former mariner, and de&s;cended about fifty paces by means of a rope. I at la&s;t arrived at a &s;mall &s;pot of level ground, where the bottom appeared different from that of the amphitheatre, being compo&s;ed of &s;oft clay, yielding to the pre&s;&s;ure, and in which I thru&s;t a &s;tick to the depth of &s;ix feet. In this, however, as above, numbers of the mo&s;t beautiful cry&s;tals were formed; one of which, particularly, re&s;embled a table. Upon our egre&s;s from this amazing cavern, we per|ceived a Greek in&s;cription upon a rock at the mouth, but &s;o obliterated by time, that we could not read it di&s;tinctly. It &s;eemed to import that one Antipater, in the time of Alexander, had come hither; but whether he penetrated into the depths of the cavern, he does not think fit to inform us." This account of &s;o beau|tiful and &s;triking a &s;cene, may &s;erve to give us &s;ome idea of the &s;ubterraneous wonders of nature.</P>

The walls were da&s;hed from their founda|tions; and no fewer than fifty-four cities, with an incredible number of villages, were either de&s;troyed or greatly damaged. The city of Catanea, in parti|cular, was utterly overthrown. A traveller, who was on his way thither, perceived, at the di&s;tance of &s;ome miles, a black cloud, like night, hanging over the place. The &s;ea, all of a &s;udden, began to roar; Mount AEtna to &s;end forth great &s;pires of flame; and &s;oon after a &s;hock en&s;ued, with a noi&s;e, as if all the artillery in the world had been at once di&s;charged.

<P>IN the progre&s;s of the Divine works and govern|ment, there arrived a period, in which this earth was to be called into exi&s;tence.

<HEAD>SECTION VII. On Charity.</HEAD>
<P>CHARITY is the &s;ame with benevolence or love; and is the term uniformly employed, in the New Te&s;|tament, to denote all the good affections which we ought to bear towards one another. It con&s;i&s;ts not in &s;peculative ideas of general benevolence, floating in the head, and leaving the heart, as &s;peculations too often do, untouched and cold. Neither is it confined to that indolent good nature, which makes us re&s;t &s;atisfied with being free from inveterate malice, or ill-will to our fellow-creatures, without prompting us to be of &s;ervice to any. True charity is an active principle. It is not properly a &s;ingle virtue; but a di&s;po&s;ition re&s;iding in the heart, as a fountain whence all the virtues of benignity, candour, forbearance, ge|nero&s;ity, compa&s;&s;ion, and liberality, flow, as &s;o many native &s;treams. From general good-will to all, it ex|tends its influence particularly to tho&s;e with whom we &s;tand in neare&s;t connexion, and who are directly within the &s;phere of our good offices. From the country or community to which we belong, it de|&s;cends to the &s;maller a&s;&s;ociations of neighbourhood, re|lations, and friends; and &s;preads it&s;elf over the whole circle of &s;ocial and dome&s;tic life. I mean not that it imports a promi&s;cuous undi&s;tingui&s;hing affection, which gives every man an equal title to our love. Charity, if we &s;hould endeavour to carry it &s;o far, would be ren|dered an impracticable virtue; and would re&s;olve it|&s;elf into mere words, without affecting the heart. True charity attempts not to &s;hut our eyes to the
<PB N="106" REF="035851_0143_100793F960DFB9C8">
di&s;tinction between good and bad men; nor to warm our hearts equally to tho&s;e who befriend, and tho&s;e who injure us. It re&s;erves our e&s;teem for good men, and our complacency for our friends. Towards our enemies it in&s;pires forgivene&s;s, humanity, and a &s;olici|tude for their welfare. It breathes univer&s;al candour, and liberality of &s;entiment. It forms gentlene&s;s of temper, and dictates affability of manners. It prompts corre&s;ponding &s;ympathies with them who rejoice, and them who weep. It teaches us to &s;light and de&s;pi&s;e no man. Charity is the comforter of the afflicted, the protector of the oppre&s;&s;ed, the reconciler of dif|ferences, the interce&s;&s;or for offenders. It is faithful|ne&s;s in the friend, public &s;pirit in the magi&s;trate, equity and patience in the judge, moderation in the &s;overeign, and loyalty in the &s;ubject. In parents, it is care and attention; in children, it is reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. In a word, it is the &s;oul of &s;ocial life. It is the &s;un that enlivens and cheers the abodes of men. It is "like the dew of Hermon," &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, "and the dew that de&s;cendeth on the moun|tains of Zion, where the Lord commanded the ble&s;&s;|ing, even life for evermore."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION X. Character of Alfred, King of England.</HEAD>
<P>THE merit of this prince, both in private and pub|lic life, may, with advantage, be &s;et in oppo&s;ition to that of any monarch or citizen, which the annals of any age, or any nation, can pre&s;ent to us. He &s;eems, indeed, to be the complete model of that perfect cha|racter, which, under the denomination of a &s;age or wi&s;e man, the philo&s;ophers have been fond of deli|neating, rather as a fiction of their imagination, than in hopes of ever &s;eeing it reduced to practice: &s;o hap|pily were all his virtues tempered together; &s;o ju&s;tly were they blended; and &s;o powerfully did each pre|vent the other from exceeding its proper bounds.</P>
<P>He knew how to conciliate the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit with the coole&s;t moderation; the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate per&s;everance, with the ea&s;ie&s;t flexibility; the mo&s;t &s;e|vere ju&s;tice, with the greate&s;t lenity; the greate&s;t ri|gour in command with the greate&s;t affability of de|portment; the highe&s;t capacity and inclination for &s;cience, with the mo&s;t &s;hining talents for action.</P>
<P>Nature al&s;o, as if de&s;irous that &s;o bright a produc|tion of her &s;kill &s;hould be &s;et in the faire&s;t light, had be&s;towed on him all bodily accompli&s;hments; vigour of limbs, dignity of &s;hape and air, and a plea&s;ant, en|gaging, and open countenance. By living in that bar|barous age, he was deprived of hi&s;torians worthy to tran&s;mit his fame to po&s;terity; and we wi&s;h to &s;ee him delineated in more lively colours, and with more par|ticular &s;trokes, that we might at lea&s;t perceive &s;ome of

<HEAD>SECTION XI. Character of Queen Elizabeth.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few per&s;onages in hi&s;tory, who have been more expo&s;ed to the calumny of enemies, and the adulation of friends, than Queen Elizabeth; and yet there &s;carcely is any, who&s;e reputation has been more certainly determined by the unanimous con&s;ent of po|&s;terity. The unu&s;ual length of her admini&s;tration, and the &s;trong features of her character, were able to over|come all prejudices; and, obliging her detractors to abate much of their invectives, and her admirers &s;ome|what of their panegyrics, have, at la&s;t, in &s;pite of poli|tical factions, and what is more, of religious animo&s;ities, produced a uniform judgment with regard to her con|duct. Her vigour, her con&s;tancy, her magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, and addre&s;s, are allowed to me|rit the highe&s;t prai&s;es; and appear not to have been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by any per&s;on who ever filled a throne: a conduct le&s;s rigorous, le&s;s imperious, more &s;incere, more indulgent to her people, would have been requi|&s;ite to form a perfect character. By the force of her mind, &s;he controlled all her more active and &s;tronger qualities; and prevented them from running into ex|ce&s;s. Her heroi&s;m was exempted from all temerity; her frugality from avarice; her friend&s;hip from par|tiality; her enterpri&s;e from turbulency and a vain am|bition. She guarded not her&s;elf, with equal care, or
<PB N="112" REF="035851_0149_10079408E3DA92D8">
equal &s;ucce&s;s, from le&s;s infirmities; the rival&s;hip of beauty, the de&s;ire of admiration, the jealou&s;y of love, and the &s;allies of anger.</P>
<P>Her &s;ingular talents for government were founded equally on her temper and on her capacity. Endowed with a great command over her&s;elf, &s;he &s;oon obtained an uncontrolled a&s;cendant over the people. Few &s;ove|reigns of England &s;ucceeded to the throne in more difficult circum&s;tances; and none ever conducted the government with &s;uch uniform &s;ucce&s;s and felicity.&mdash;Though unacquainted with the practice of toleration, the true &s;ecret for managing religious factions, &s;he pro|&s;erved her people by her &s;uperior prudence, from tho&s;e confu&s;ions in which theological controver&s;y had in|volved all the neighbouring nations; and though her enemies were the mo&s;t powerful princes of Europe, the mo&s;t active, the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing, the lea&s;t &s;cru|pulous, &s;he was able, by her vigour, to make deep im|pre&s;&s;ions on their &s;tate; her own greatne&s;s meanwhile remaining untouched and unimpaired.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e mini&s;ters and brave men who flouri&s;hed during her reign, &s;hare the prai&s;e of her &s;ucce&s;s; but, in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening the applau&s;e due to her, they make great addition to it. They owed, all of them, their advancement to her choice; they were &s;upported by her con&s;tancy; and, with all their ability, they were never able to acquire an undue a&s;cendant over her. In her family, in her court, in her kingdom, &s;he remained equally mi&s;tre&s;s. The force of the tender pa&s;&s;ions was great over her, but the force of her mind was &s;till &s;u|perior: and the combat which her victory vi&s;ibly co&s;t her, &s;erves only to di&s;play the firmne&s;s of her re&s;olu|tion, and the loftine&s;s of her ambitious &s;entiments.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="035851_0150_1007940B55B69800">
The &s;ame of this prince&s;s, though it has &s;urmounted the prejudices both of faction and of bigotry, yet lies &s;till expo&s;ed to another prejudice, which is more durable, becau&s;e more natural; and which, according to the different views in which we &s;urvey her, is ca|pable either of exalting beyond mea&s;ure, or dimini&s;h|ing, the lu&s;tre of her character. This prejudice is founded on the con&s;ideration of her &s;ex. When we contemplate her as a woman, we are apt to be &s;truck with the highe&s;t admiration of her qualities and ex|ten&s;ive capacity; but we are al&s;o apt to require &s;ome more &s;oftne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ome greater lenity of tem|per, &s;ome of tho&s;e amiable weakne&s;&s;es by which her &s;ex is di&s;tingui&s;hed. But the true method of e&s;timating her merit, is, to lay a&s;ide all the&s;e con&s;iderations, and to con&s;ider her merely as a rational being, placed in authority, and intru&s;ted with the government of man|kind.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XII. On the Slavery of Vice.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;lavery produced by vice appears in the de|pendence under which it brings the &s;inner, to circum|&s;tances of external fortune. One of the favourite cha|racters of liberty, is the independence it be&s;tows. He who is truly a freeman is above all &s;ervile compliances, and abject &s;ubjection. He is able to re&s;t upon him&s;elf; and while he regards his &s;uperiors with proper defe|rence, neither deba&s;es him&s;elf by cringing to them, nor is tempted to purcha&s;e their favour by di&s;honourable means. But the &s;inner has forfeited every privilege of
<PB N="114" REF="035851_0151_1007940F8138D5F0">
this nature. His pa&s;&s;ions and habits render him an ab&s;o|lute dependent on the world, and the world's favour; on the uncertain goods of fortune, and the fickle humours of men. For it is by the&s;e he &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and among the&s;e his happine&s;s is &s;ought; according as his pa&s;&s;ions de|termine him to pur&s;ue plea&s;ures; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iches, or preferments. Having no fund within him&s;elf whence to draw enjoy|ment, his only re&s;ource is in things without. His hopes and fears all hang upon the world. He partakes in all its vici&s;&s;itudes; and is moved and &s;haken by every wind of fortune. This is to be in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e a &s;lave to the world.</P>
<P>Religion and virtue, on the other hand, confer on the mind principles of noble independence. "The upright man is &s;atisfied from him&s;elf." He de&s;pi&s;es not the advantages of fortune, but he centers not his happine&s;s in them. With a moderate &s;hare of them he can be contented; and contentment is felicity. Happy in his own integrity, con&s;cious of the e&s;teem of good men, repo&s;ing firm tru&s;t in the providence, and the promi&s;es of God, he is exempted from &s;ervile depend|ence on other things. He can wrap him&s;elf up in a good con&s;cience, and look forward, without terror, to the change of the world. Let all things &s;hift around him as they plea&s;e, he believes that, by the Divine ordination, they &s;hall be made to work together in the i&s;&s;ue for his good: And therefore, having much to hope from God, and little to fear from the world, he can be ea&s;y in every &s;tate. One who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es within him&s;elf &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment of mind, is truly free. But &s;hall I call that man free, who has nothing that is his own, no property a&s;&s;ured; who&s;e very heart is not his own, but rendered the appendage of external things, and
<PB N="115" REF="035851_0152_100794120CF9CED0">
the &s;port of fortune? Is that man free, let his outward condition be ever &s;o &s;plendid, whom his imperious pa&s;&s;ions detain at their call, whom they &s;end forth at their plea&s;ure, to drudge and toil, and to beg his only enjoyment from the ca&s;ualties of the world? Is he free, who mu&s;t flatter and lie to compa&s;s his ends, who mu&s;t bear with this man's caprice, and that man's &s;corn; mu&s;t profe&s;s friend&s;hip where he hates, and re&s;pect where he contemns; who is not at liberty to appear in his own colours, nor to &s;peak his own &s;en|timents; who dares not be hone&s;t, le&s;t he &s;hould be poor?&mdash;Believe it, no chains bind &s;o hard, no fet|ters are &s;o heavy, as tho&s;e which fa&s;ten the corrupted heart to this treacherous world; no dependence is more contemptible than that under which the volup|tuous, the covetous, or the ambitious man, lies to the means of plea&s;ure, gain, or power. Yet this is the boa&s;ted liberty, which vice promi&s;es, as the recom|pen&s;e of &s;etting us free from the &s;alutary re&s;traints of virtue.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIII. The Man of Integrity.</HEAD>
<P>IT will not take much time to delineate the charac|ter of the man of integrity, as by its nature it is a plain one, and ea&s;ily under&s;tood. He is one, who makes it his con&s;tant rule to follow the road of duty, according as the word of God, and the voice of his con&s;cience, point it out to him. He is not guided merely by affections, which may &s;ometimes give the
<PB N="116" REF="035851_0153_1007941399DFFA48">
colour of virtue to a loo&s;e and un&s;table character. The upright man is guided by a fixed principle of mind, which determines him to e&s;teem nothing but what is honourable; and to abhor whatever is ba&s;e and unworthy, in moral conduct. Hence we find him ever the &s;ame; at all times, the tru&s;ty friend, the af|fectionate relation, the con&s;cientious man of bu&s;ine&s;s, the pious wor&s;hipper, the public &s;pirited citizen. He a&s;&s;umes no borrowed appearance. He &s;eeks no ma&s;k to cover him; for he acts no &s;tudied part; but he is indeed what he appears to be, full of truth, candour, and humanity. In all his pur&s;uits, he knows no path but the fair and direct one; aud would much rather fail of &s;ucce&s;s, than attain it by reproachful means. He never &s;hows us a &s;miling countenance, while he medi|tates evil again&s;t us in his heart. He never prai&s;es us among our friends; and then joins in traducing us among our enemies. We &s;hall never find one part of his character at variance with another. In his man|ners, he is &s;imple and unaffected; in all his proceed|ings, open and con&s;i&s;tent.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIV. On Gentlene&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>I begin with di&s;tingui&s;hing true gentlene&s;s from pa&s;&s;ive tamene&s;s of &s;pirit, and from unlimited com|pliance with the manners of others. That pa&s;&s;ive tamene&s;s, which &s;ubmits, without oppo&s;ition, to every encroachment of the violent and a&s;&s;uming, forms no part of Chri&s;tian duty; but, on the contrary, is de|&s;tructive of general happine&s;s and order. That unli|mited
<PB N="117" REF="035851_0154_100794184E711138">
complai&s;ance, which, on every occa&s;ion, falls in with the opinions and manners of others, is &s;o far from being a virtue, that it is it&s;elf a vice, and the parent of many vices. It overthrows all &s;teadine&s;s of prin|ciple; and produces that &s;inful conformity with the world, which taints the whole character. In the pre|&s;ent corrupted &s;tate of human manners, always to a&s;|&s;ent and to comply, is the very wor&s;t maxim we can adopt. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport the purity and dig|nity of Chri&s;tian morals, without oppo&s;ing the world on various occa&s;ions, even though we &s;hould &s;tand alone. That gentlene&s;s therefore which belongs to vir|tue, is to be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from the mean &s;pi|rit of cowards, and the fawning a&s;&s;ent of &s;ycophants. It renounces no ju&s;t right from fear. It gives up no important truth from flattery. It is indeed not only con&s;i&s;tent with a firm mind, but it nece&s;&s;arily requires a manly &s;pirit, and a fixed principle, in order to give it any real value. Upon this &s;olid ground only, the poli&s;h of gentlene&s;s can with advantage be &s;uperin|duced.</P>
<P>It &s;tands oppo&s;ed, not to the mo&s;t determined regard for virtue and truth, but to har&s;hne&s;s and &s;everity, to pride and arrogance, to violence and oppre&s;&s;ion. It is properly, that part of the great virtue of charity, which makes us unwilling to give pain to any of our brethren. Compa&s;&s;ion prompts us to relieve their wants. Forbearance prevents us from retaliating their injuries. Meekne&s;s re&s;trains our angry pa&s;&s;ions; can|dour, our &s;evere judgments. Gentlene&s;s corrects what|ever is offen&s;ive in our manners; and, by a con&s;tant train of humane attentions, &s;tudies to alleviate the burden of common mi&s;ery. Its office, therefore, is
<PB N="118" REF="035851_0155_1007941B64387600">
exten&s;ive. It is not, like &s;ome other virtues, called forth only on peculiar emergencies; but it is conti|nually in action, when we are engaged in intercour&s;e with men. It ought to form our addre&s;s, to regulate our &s;peech, and to diffu&s;e it&s;elf over our whole beha|viour.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not, however, confound this gentle "wi&s;|dom which is from above," with that artificial courte&s;y, that &s;tudied &s;moothne&s;s of manners, which is learned in the &s;chool of the world. Such accompli&s;hments, the mo&s;t frivolous and empty may po&s;&s;e&s;s. Too often they are employed by the artful, as a &s;nare; too often affected by the hard and unfeeling, as a cover to the ba&s;ene&s;s of their minds. We cannot, at the &s;ame time, avoid ob&s;erving the homage, which, even in &s;uch in|&s;tances, the world is con&s;trained to pay to virtue. In order to render &s;ociety agreeable, it is found ne|ce&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ume &s;omewhat, that may at lea&s;t carry its appearance. Virtue is the univer&s;al charm. Even its &s;hadow is courted, when the &s;ub&s;tance is wanting. The imitation of its form has been reduced into an art; and in the commerce of life, the fir&s;t &s;tudy of all who would either gain the e&s;teem, or win the hearts of others, is to learn the &s;peech, and to adopt the man|ners, of candour, gentlene&s;s, and humanity. But that gentlene&s;s which is the characteri&s;tic of a good man, has, like every other virtue, its &s;eat in the heart: and let me add, nothing except what flows from the heart, can render even external manners truly plea&s;ing. For no a&s;&s;umed behaviour can at all times hide the real character. In that unaffected civility which &s;prings from a gentle mind, there is a charm infinitely more powerful, than in all the &s;tudied manners of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed courtier.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="035851_0156_1007941E4CABDDB0">
True gentlene&s;s is founded on a &s;en&s;e of what we owe to HIM who made us, and to the common nature of which we all &s;hare. It ari&s;es from reflection on our own failings and wants; and from ju&s;t views of the condition, and the duty of man. It is native feeling, heightened and improved by principle. It is the heart which ea&s;ily relents; which feels for every thing that is human; and is backward and &s;low to inflict the lea&s;t wound. It is affable in its addre&s;s, and mild in its demeanour; ever ready to oblige, and willing to be obliged by others; breathing habitual kindne&s;s towards friends, courte&s;y to &s;trangers, long-&s;uffering to enemies. It exerci&s;es authority with moderation; admini&s;ters re|proof with tenderne&s;s; confers favours with ea&s;e and mode&s;ty. It is una&s;&s;uming in opinion, and temperate in zeal. It contends not eagerly about trifles; &s;low to contradict, and &s;till &s;lower to blame; but prompt to allay di&s;&s;ention, and to re&s;tore peace. It neither in|termeddles unnece&s;&s;arily with the affairs, nor pries in|qui&s;itively into the &s;ecrets of others. It delights above all things to alleviate di&s;tre&s;s; and, if it cannot dry up the falling tear, to &s;ooth at lea&s;t the grieving heart. Where it has not the power of being u&s;eful, it is ne|ver burden&s;ome. It &s;eeks to plea&s;e, rather than to &s;hine and dazzle; and conceals with care, that &s;uperi|ority, either of talents, or of rank, which is oppre&s;&s;ive to tho&s;e who are beneath it. In a word, it is that &s;pi|rit and that tenour of manners, which the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t enjoins, when it commands us "to bear one another's burdens; to rejoice with tho&s;e who rejoice, and to weep with tho&s;e who weep; to plea&s;e every one his neighbour for his good; to be kind and tender|hearted; to be pitiful and courteous; to &s;upport the weak, and to be patient towards all men."</P>

<P>THE Earl of Strafford defended him&s;elf again&s;t the accu&s;ations of the hou&s;e of Commons, with all the pre|&s;ence of mind, judgment, and &s;agacity, that could be expected from innocence and ability. His children were placed be&s;ide him, as he was thus defending his life, and the cau&s;e of his royal ma&s;ter. After he had, in a long and eloquent &s;peech, delivered without pre|meditation, confuted all the accu&s;ations of his enemies, he thus drew to a conclu&s;ion. "But, my Lords, I have troubled you too long: longer than I &s;hould have done, but for the &s;ake of the&s;e dear pledges, which a &s;aint in heaven has left me."&mdash;Upon this he pau&s;ed; dropped a tear; looked upon his children; and pro|ceeded.&mdash;"What I forfeit for my&s;elf is a trifle: that my indi&s;cretions &s;hould reach my po&s;terity, wounds me to the heart. Pardon my infirmity.&mdash;Something I &s;hould have added, but I am not able; and therefore I let it pa&s;s. And now, my Lords, for my&s;elf. I have long been taught, that the afflictions of this life are overpaid by that eternal weight of glory, which awaits the innocent. And &s;o, my Lords, even &s;o, with the

utmo&s;t tranquillity, I &s;ubmit my&s;elf to your judgment, whether that judgment be life or death: not my will, but thine, O God, be done!"</P>
<P>His eloquence and innocence induced tho&s;e judges to pity, who were the mo&s;t zealous to condemn him. The King him&s;elf went to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and &s;poke for &s;ome time in his defence; but the &s;pirit of vengeance, which had been chained for eleven years, was now rou&s;ed; and nothing but his blood could give the people &s;atisfaction. He was condemned by both Hou&s;es of Parliament; and nothing remained but for the King to give his con&s;ent to the bill of attainder. But in the pre&s;ent commotions, the con&s;ent of the King would very ea&s;ily be di&s;pen&s;ed with; and immi|nent danger might attend his refu&s;al. Charles, how|ever, who loved Strafford tenderly, he&s;itated, and &s;eemed reluctant; trying every expedient to put off &s;o dreadful an office, as that of &s;igning the warrant for his execution. While he continued in this agitation of mind, and &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, his doubts were at la&s;t &s;ilenced by an act of great magnanimity in the con|demned Lord. He received a letter from that unfor|tunate nobleman, de&s;iring that his life might be made a &s;acrifice to obtain reconciliation between the King and his people: adding, that he was prepared to die; and that to a willing mind there could be no injury. This in&s;tance of noble genero&s;ity was but ill repaid by his ma&s;ter, who complied with his reque&s;t. He con|&s;ented to &s;ign the fatal bill by commi&s;&s;ion; and Straf|ford was beheaded on Tower-Hill; behaving with all that compo&s;ed dignity of re&s;olution, which was ex|pected from his character.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. An eminent In&s;tance of true Fortitude of Mind.</HEAD>
<P>ALL who have been di&s;tingui&s;hed as &s;ervants of God, or benefactors of men; all who, in perilous &s;itu|ations, have acted their part with &s;uch honour as to render their names illu&s;trious through &s;ucceeding ages, have been eminent for fortitude of mind. Of this we have one con&s;picuous example in the Apo&s;tle Paul, whom it will be in&s;tructive for us to view in a remarkable occurrence of his life. After having long acted as the apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, his mi&s;&s;ion called him to go to Jeru&s;alem, where he knew that he was to encounter the utmo&s;t violence of his enemies. Ju&s;t before he &s;et &s;ail, he called together the elders of his favourite church at Ephe&s;us; and, in a pathetic &s;peech, which does great honour to his character, gave them his la&s;t farewell. Deeply affected by their knowledge of the certain dangers to which he was expo&s;ing him|&s;elf, all the a&s;&s;embly were filled with di&s;tre&s;s, and melted into tears. The circum&s;tances were &s;uch, as might have conveyed dejection even into a re&s;olute mind; and would have totally overwhelmed the feeble. "They all wept &s;ore, and fell on Paul's neck, and ki&s;&s;ed him; &s;orrowing mo&s;t of all for the words which he &s;poke, that they &s;hould &s;ee his face no more."&mdash;What were then the &s;entiments, what was the lan|guage, of this great and good man? Hear the words which &s;poke his firm and undaunted mind. "Behold, I go bound in the &s;pirit, to Jeru&s;alem, not knowing the things that &s;hall befal me there; &s;ave that the
<PB N="123" REF="035851_0160_1007942A33D5A740">
Holy Spirit witne&s;&s;eth in every city, &s;aying, that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of the&s;e things move me; neither count I my life dear to my&s;elf, &s;o that I might fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy, and the mi|ni&s;try which I have received of the Lord Je&s;us, to te&s;tify the go&s;pel of the grace of God." There was uttered the voice, there breathed the &s;pirit, of a brave and a virtuous man. Such a man knows not what it is to &s;hrink from danger, when con&s;cience points out his path. In that path he is determined to walk; let the con&s;equences be what they may.</P>
<P>This was the magnanimous behaviour of that great Apo&s;tle, when he had per&s;ecution and di&s;tre&s;s full in view. Attend now to the &s;entiments of the &s;ame ex|cellent man, when the time of his la&s;t &s;uffering ap|proached; and remark the maje&s;ty, and the ea&s;e, with which he looked on death.

Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s." How many years of life does &s;uch a dying moment overbalance? Who would not choo&s;e, in this manner, to go off the &s;tage, with &s;uch a &s;ong of triumph in his mouth, rather than prolong his exi&s;tence through a wretched old age, &s;tained with &s;in and &s;hame?</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. The Clo&s;e of Life.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we contemplate the clo&s;e of life; the termi|nation of man's de&s;igns and hopes; the &s;ilence that now reigns among tho&s;e who, a little while ago, were &s;o bu&s;y, or &s;o gay; who can avoid being touched with &s;en&s;ations at once awful and tender? What heart but then warms with the glow of humanity? In who&s;e eye does not the tear gather, on revolving the fate of pa&s;&s;ing and &s;hort-lived man?</P>
<P>Behold the poor man who lays down at la&s;t the burden of his weari&s;ome life. No more &s;hall he groan under the load of poverty and toil. No more &s;hall he hear the in&s;olent calls of the ma&s;ter, from whom he received his &s;canty wages. No more &s;hall he be rai&s;ed from needful &s;lumber on his bed of &s;traw, nor be hurried away from his homely meal, to undergo the repeated labours of the day. While his humble grave is preparing, and a few poor and decayed neighbours are carrying him thither, it is good for us to think, that this man too was our brother; that for him the aged and de&s;titute wife, and the needy child|ren, now weep; that, neglected as he was by the world, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed perhaps both a &s;ound under&s;tand|ing, and a worthy heart; and is now carried by angels to re&s;t in Abraham's bo&s;om.&mdash;At no great di&s;tance from him, the grave is opened to receive the rich and proud man. For, as it is &s;aid with empha&s;is in the parable, "the rich man al&s;o died, and was buried." He al&s;o died. His riches prevented not his &s;haring
<PB N="126" REF="035851_0163_10079432E7C65F80">
the &s;ame fate with the poor man; perhaps, through luxury, they accelerated his doom. Then, indeed, "the mourners go about the &s;treets;" and while, in all the pomp and magnificence of woe, his funeral is prepared, his heirs, impatient to examine his will, are looking on one another with jealous eyes, and already beginning to di&s;pute about the divi&s;ion of his &s;ub&s;tance.&mdash;One day, we &s;ee carried along the coffin of the &s;miling infant; the flower ju&s;t nipped as it began to blo&s;&s;om in the parent's view: and the next day, we behold the young man, or young woman, of blooming form and promi&s;ing hopes, laid in an un|timely grave. While the funeral is attended by a numerous unconcerned company, who are di&s;cour&s;ing to one another about the news of the day, or the ordi|nary affairs of life, let our thoughts rather follow to the hou&s;e of mourning, and repre&s;ent to them&s;elves what is pa&s;&s;ing there. There, we &s;hould &s;ee a di&s;|con&s;olate family, &s;itting in &s;ilent grief, thinking of the &s;ad breach that is made in their little &s;ociety; and, with tears in their eyes, looking to the chamber that is now left vacant, and to every memorial that pre|&s;ents it&s;elf of their departed friend. By &s;uch attention to the woes of others, the &s;elfi&s;h hardne&s;s of our hearts will be gradually &s;oftened, and melted down into hu|manity.</P>
<P>Another day, we follow to the grave, one who, in old age, and after a long career of life, has in full maturity &s;unk at la&s;t into re&s;t. As we are going along to the man&s;ion of the dead, it is natural for us to think, and to di&s;cour&s;e, of all the changes which &s;uch a per|&s;on has &s;een during the cour&s;e of his life. He has pa&s;&s;ed, it is likely, through varieties of fortune. He
<PB N="127" REF="035851_0164_10079435B7B5D358">
has experienced pro&s;perity, and adver&s;ity. He has &s;een families and kindreds ri&s;e and fall. He has &s;een peace and war &s;ucceeding in their turns; the face of his country undergoing many alterations; and the very city in which he dwelt ri&s;ing, in a manner, new around him. After all he has beheld, his eyes are now clo&s;ed for ever. He was becoming a &s;tranger in the mid&s;t of a new &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men. A race who knew him not, had ari&s;en to fill the earth. Thus pa&s;&s;es the world away. Throughout all ranks and conditions, "one generation pa&s;&s;eth, and another ge|neration cometh;" and this great inn is by turns eva|cuated, and repleni&s;hed, by troops of &s;ucceeding pil|grims.&mdash;O vain and incon&s;tant world! O fleeting and tran&s;ient life! When will the &s;ons of men learn to think of thee as they ought! When will they learn humanity from the afflictions of their brethren; or moderation and wi&s;dom from the &s;en&s;e of their own fugitive &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. Exalted Society, and the Renewal of virtuous Connexions, two &s;ources of future Felicity.</HEAD>
<P>BESIDES the felicity which &s;prings from perfect love, there are two circum&s;tances which particularly enhance the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of that "multitude who &s;tand before the throne;" the&s;e are, acce&s;s to the mo&s;t ex|alted &s;ociety, and renewal of the mo&s;t tender con|nexions. The former is pointed out in the Scripture, by "joining the innumerable company of angels, and the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born; by

fitting down with Abraham, and I&s;aac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;" a promi&s;e which opens the &s;ublime&s;t pro&s;pects to the human mind. It allows good men to entertain the hope, that &s;eparated from all the dregs of the human ma&s;s, from that mixed and polluted crowd in the mid&s;t of which they now dwell, they &s;hall be permitted to mingle with prophets, patriarchs, and apo&s;tles, with all tho&s;e great and illu&s;trious &s;pirits, who have &s;hone in former ages as the &s;ervants of God, or the benefactors of men; who&s;e deeds we are accu&s;|tomed to celebrate; who&s;e &s;teps we now follow at a di&s;tance; and who&s;e names we pronounce with vene|ration.</P>

The pro|&s;pect of this awakens in the heart, the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and tender &s;entiment that perhaps can fill it, in this mortal &s;tate. For of all the &s;orrows which we are here doomed to endure, none is &s;o bitter as that oc|ca&s;ioned by the fatal &s;troke which &s;eparates us, in ap|pearance for ever, from tho&s;e to whom either nature or friend&s;hip had intimately joined our hearts.

<HEAD>SECTION VI. The Clemency and amiable Character of the Patriarch Jo&s;eph.</HEAD>
<P>No human character exhibited in the records of Scripture, is more remarkable or in&s;tructive than that of the patriarch Jo&s;eph. He is one whom we behold tried in all the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune; from the condi|tion of a &s;lave, ri&s;ing to be ruler of the land of Egypt; and in every &s;tation acquiring, by his virtue and wi&s;|dom, favour with God and man. When over&s;eer of Potiphar's hou&s;e, his fidelity was proved by &s;trong temptations, which he honourably re&s;i&s;ted. When thrown into pri&s;on by the artifice of a fal&s;e woman, his integrity and prudence &s;oon rendered him con&s;picu|ous, even in that dark man&s;ion. When called into the pre&s;ence of Pharaoh, the wi&s;e and exten&s;ive plan which he formed for &s;aving the kingdom from the mi&s;eries of impending famine, ju&s;tly rai&s;ed him to a high &s;tation, wherein his abilities were eminently di&s;played in the public &s;ervice. But in his whole hi&s;tory, there is no circum&s;tance &s;o &s;triking and intere&s;ting, as his beha|viour to his brethren who had &s;old him into &s;lavery. The moment in which he made him&s;elf known to them, was the mo&s;t critical one of his life, and the mo&s;t deci&s;ive of his character. It is &s;uch as rarely oc|curs in the cour&s;e of human events; and is calculated
<PB N="130" REF="035851_0167_1007943E5E3CE7E0">
to draw the highe&s;t attention of all who are endowed with any degree of &s;en&s;ibility of heart.</P>
<P>From the whole tenour of the narration it appears, that though Jo&s;eph, upon the arrival of his brethren in Egypt, made him&s;elf &s;trange to them, yet from the be|ginning he intended to di&s;cover him&s;elf; and &s;tudied &s;o to conduct the di&s;covery, as might render the &s;urpri&s;e of joy complete. For this end, by affected &s;everity, he took mea&s;ures for bringing down into Egypt all his father's children. They were now arrived there; and Benja|min among the re&s;t, who was his younger brother by the &s;ame mother, and was particularly beloved by Jo&s;eph. Him he threatened to detain; and &s;eemed willing to allow the re&s;t to depart. This incident re|newed their di&s;tre&s;s. They all knew their father's ex|treme anxiety about the &s;afety of Benjamin, and with what difficulty he had yielded to his undertaking this journey. Should he be prevented from returning, they dreaded that grief would overpower the old man's &s;pirits, and prove fatal to his life. Judah, therefore, who had particularly urged the nece&s;&s;ity of Benjamin's accompanying his brothers, and had &s;olemnly pledged him&s;elf to their father for his &s;afe return, craved, upon this occa&s;ion, an audience of the governour; and gave him a full account of the circum&s;tances of Jacob's fa|mily.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more intere&s;ting and pathetic than this di&s;cour&s;e of Judah. Little knowing to whom he &s;poke, he paints in all the colours of &s;imple and natural eloquence, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of the aged patri|arch, ha&s;tening to the clo&s;e of life; long afflicted for the lo&s;s of a favourite &s;on, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to have been turn in pieces by a bea&s;t of prey; labouring now
<PB N="131" REF="035851_0168_1007943FEEE6C660">
under anxious concern about his younge&s;t &s;on, the child of his old age, who alone was left alive of his mother, and whom nothing but the calamities of &s;e|vere famine could have moved a tender father to &s;end from home, and expo&s;e to the dangers of a foreign land. "If we bring him not back with us, we &s;hall bring down the grey hairs of thy &s;ervant, our father, with &s;orrow to the grave. I pray thee therefore let thy &s;ervant abide, in&s;tead of the young man, a bond|man to our lord. For how &s;hall I go up to my fa|ther, and Benjamin not with me? le&s;t I &s;ee the evil that &s;hall come on my father."</P>
<P>Upon this relation, Jo&s;eph could no longer re&s;train him&s;elf. The tender ideas of his father and his father's hou&s;e, of his ancient home, his country and his kin|dred, of the di&s;tre&s;s of his family, and his own exalta|tion, all ru&s;hed too &s;trongly upon his mind to bear any farther concealment. "He cried, cau&s;e every man to go out from me; and he wept aloud." The tears which he &s;hed were not the tears of grief. They were the bur&s;t of affection. They were the effu&s;ions of a heart overflowing with all the tender &s;en&s;ibilities of nature. Formerly he had been moved in the &s;ame manner, when he fir&s;t &s;aw his brethren before him. "His bowels yearned upon them; he &s;ought for a place where to weep. He went into his chamber; and then wa&s;hed his face and returned to them." At that period his generous plans were not completed. But now, when there was no farther occa&s;ion for con|&s;training him&s;elf, he gave free vent to the &s;trong emo|tions of his heart. The fir&s;t mini&s;ter to the king of Egypt was not a&s;hamed to &s;how, that he felt as a man,
<PB N="132" REF="035851_0169_10079442D6A3DE30">
and a brother. "He wept aloud; and the Egyptians, and the hou&s;e of Pharaoh heard him."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t words which his &s;welling heart allowed him to pronounce, are the mo&s;t &s;uitable to &s;uch an af|fecting &s;ituation that were ever uttered;&mdash;"I am Jo&s;eph; doth my father yet live?&mdash;What could he, what ought he, in that impa&s;&s;ioned moment, to have &s;aid more? This is the voice of Nature her&s;elf, &s;peak|ing her own language; and it penetrates the heart: No pomp of expre&s;&s;ion; no parade of kindne&s;s; but &s;trong affection ha&s;tening to utter what it &s;trongly felt. "His brethren could not an&s;wer him; for they were troubled at his pre&s;ence." Their &s;ilence is as expre&s;|&s;ive of tho&s;e emotions of repentance and &s;hame, which, on this amazing di&s;covery, filled their brea&s;ts, and &s;top|ped their utterance, as the few words which Jo&s;eph &s;peaks, are expre&s;&s;ive of the generous agitations which &s;truggled for vent within him. No painter could &s;eize a more &s;triking moment for di&s;playing the character|i&s;tical features of the human heart, than what is here pre&s;ented. Never was there a &s;ituation of more ten|der and virtuous joy, on the one hand; nor, on the other, of more overwhelming confu&s;ion and con&s;cious guilt. In the &s;imple narration of the &s;acred hi&s;torian, it is &s;et before us with greater energy and higher ef|fect, than if it had been wrought up with all the co|louring of the mo&s;t admired modern eloquence.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The following account of an affecting, mournful exit, is related by Dr. Toung, who was pre&s;ent at the melancholy &s;cene.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ad evening before the death of that noble youth, who&s;e la&s;t hours &s;ugge&s;ted the&s;e thoughts, I was with him. No one was there, but his phy&s;ician, and an intimate whom he loved, and whom he had ruined. At my coming in, he &s;aid,&mdash;"You and the phy&s;ician are come too late.&mdash;I have neither life nor hope. You both aim at miracles. You would rai&s;e the dead!"</P>
<P>Heaven, I &s;aid, was merciful&mdash;"Or," exclaimed he,&mdash;"I could not have been thus guilty. What has it not done to ble&s;s, and to &s;ave me?&mdash;I have been too &s;trong for Omnipotence! I have plucked down ruin."&mdash;I &s;aid, the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer,&mdash;"Hold! hold! you wound me!&mdash;That is the rock on which I &s;plit&mdash;I denied his name!"</P>
<P>Refu&s;ing to hear any thing from me, or take any thing from the phy&s;ician, he lay &s;ilent, as far as &s;ud|den darts of pain would permit, till the clock &s;truck: Then with vehemence;&mdash;"Oh! time! time! it is fit thou &s;hould&s;t thus &s;trike thy murderer to the heart!&mdash;How art thou fled for ever!&mdash;A month!&mdash;Oh, for a &s;ingle week! I a&s;k not for years; though an age were too little for the much I have to do."</P>
<P>On my &s;aying, we could not do too much: that heaven was a ble&s;&s;ed place&mdash;</P>
<P>"So much the wor&s;e.&mdash;'Tis lo&s;t! 'tis lo&s;t!&mdash;Heaven is to me the &s;evere&s;t part of hell!"</P>
<P>Soon after I propo&s;ed prayer. "Pray you that can. I never prayed. I cannot pray:&mdash;Nor need <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="134" REF="035851_0171_10079446E023F378">

<P>His friend being much touched, even to tears at this&mdash;(who could forbear? I could not)&mdash;with a mo&s;t affectionate look, he &s;aid, "Keep tho&s;e tears for thy|&s;elf. I have undone thee.&mdash;Do&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eep for me? that's cruel. What can pain me more?"</P>
<P>Here his friend, too much affected, would have left him.&mdash;"No, &s;tay&mdash;thou &s;till may&s;t hope;&mdash;there|fore hear me. How madly have I talk'd! How madly ha&s;t thou li&s;tened, and believed! but look on my pre|&s;ent &s;tate, as a full an&s;wer to thee, and to my&s;elf. This body is all weakne&s;s and pain; but my &s;oul, as if &s;tung up by torment to greater &s;trength and &s;pirit, is full powerful to rea&s;on; full mighty to &s;uffer. And that, which thus triumphs within the jaws of immor|tality, is, doubtle&s;s, immortal&mdash;And as for a Deity, nothing le&s;s than an Almighty could inflict what I feel."</P>
<P>I was about to congratulate this pa&s;&s;ive, involuntary confe&s;&s;or, on his a&s;&s;erting the two prime articles of his creed, extorted by the rack of nature, when he thus, very pa&s;&s;ionately:&mdash;"No, no! let me &s;peak on. I have not long to &s;peak.&mdash;My much injured friend! my &s;oul, as my body, lies in ruins; in &s;cattered frag|ments of broken thought&mdash;Remor&s;e for the pa&s;t, throws my thought on the future. Wor&s;e dread of the future, &s;trikes it back on the pa&s;t. I turn, and turn, and find no ray. Did&s;t thou feel half the moun|tain that is on me, thou would&s;t &s;truggle with the martyr for his &s;take; and ble&s;s Heaven for the flames!&mdash;that is not an everla&s;ting flame; that is not an un|quenchable fire."</P>
<P>How were we &s;truck! yet, &s;oon after, &s;till more. With what an eye of di&s;traction, what a face of de|&s;pire!
<PB N="135" REF="035851_0172_10079449A91AA4E0">
he cried out:&mdash;"My principles have poi&s;oned my friend; my extravagance has beggared my boy! my unkindne&s;s has murdered my wife!&mdash;And is there another hell?&mdash;Oh! thou bla&s;phemed, yet indulgent LORD GOD! Hell it&s;elf is a refuge, if it hide me from thy frown!"</P>
<P>Soon after his under&s;tanding failed. His terrified imagination uttered horrors not to be repeated, or ever forgotten. And ere the &s;un (which, I hope, has &s;een few like him) aro&s;e, the gay, young, noble, ingenious, accompli&s;hed, and mo&s;t wretched Altamont expired!</P>
<P>If this is a man of plea&s;ure, what is a man of pain? How quick, how total, is their tran&s;it! In what a di&s;mal gloom they &s;et for ever! How &s;hort, alas! the day of their rejoicing!&mdash;For a moment they glitter&mdash;they dazzle. In a moment, where are they? Ob|livion covers their memories. Ah! would it did! In|famy &s;natches them from oblivion. In the long-living annals of infamy their triumphs are recorded. Thy &s;ufferings &s;till bleed in the bo&s;om, poor Altamont! of the heart-&s;tricken friend&mdash;for Altamont had a friend. He might have had many. His tran&s;ient morning might have been the dawn of an immortal day. His name might have been gloriou&s;ly enrolled in the re|cords of eternity.

could not; to re&s;train it from efforts beyond its ability; but to teach it how to advance as far as the faculties given to it by nature, with the utmo&s;t exertion and mo&s;t proper culture of them, would allow it to go. In the va&s;t ocean of philo&s;ophy, I had the line and the plummet always in my hands.

Then your huddling together in a Critical Dictionary, a plea&s;ant tale, or obscene je&s;t, and a grave argument again&s;t the Chri&s;tian religion, a witty confutation of &s;ome ab&s;urd author, and an artful &s;ophi&s;m to impeach &s;ome re&s;pectable truth, was particularly commodious to all our young &s;marts and &s;matterers in free-thinking.

Why would you &s;o fallaciou&s;ly con|found them together in &s;ome of your writings, that it requires much more judgment, and a more diligent at|tention, than ordinary readers have, to &s;eparate them again, and to make the proper di&s;tinctions?

<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. Cicero again&s;t Verres.</HEAD>
<P>THE time is come, Fathers, when that which has long been wi&s;hed for, towards allaying the envy your order has been &s;ubject to, and removing the impu|tations again&s;t trials, is effectually put in our power. An opinion has long prevailed, not only here at home, but likewi&s;e in foreign countries, both dangerous to you, and pernicious to the &s;tate,&mdash;that, in pro&s;ecutions, men of wealth are always &s;afe, however clearly con|victed. There is now to be brought upon his trial before you, to the confu&s;ion, I hope, of the propa|gators of this &s;landerous imputation, one who&s;e life and actions condemn him in the opinion of all impar|tial per&s;ons; but who, according to his own reckon|ing and declared dependence upon his riches, is al|ready acquitted; I mean Caius Verres. I demand ju&s;tice of you, Fathers, upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the public trea&s;ury, the oppre&s;&s;or of A&s;ia Minor and Pamphylia, the invader of the rights and privileges of Romans, the &s;courge and cur&s;e of Sicily. If that &s;entence is pa&s;&s;ed upon him which his crimes de&s;erve, your authority, Fathers, will be venerable and &s;acred in
<PB N="154" REF="035851_0191_1007AB476BD0F6F8">
the eyes of the public; but if his great riches &s;hould bias you in his favour, I &s;hall &s;till gain one point,&mdash;to make it apparent to all the world, that what was want|ing in this ca&s;e, was not a criminal nor a pro&s;ecutor, but ju&s;tice and adequate puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>To pa&s;s over the &s;hameful irregularities of his youth, what does his quae&s;tor&s;hip, the fir&s;t public employment he held, what does it exhibit, but one continued &s;cene of villanies? Cneius Carbo plundered of the public money by his own trea&s;urer, a con&s;ul &s;tripped and be|trayed, and army de&s;erted and reduced to want, a pro|vince robbed, the civil and religious rights of a people violated. The employment he held in A&s;ia Minor and Pamphylia, what did it produce but the ruin of tho&s;e countries? in which, hou&s;es, cities, and temples were robbed by him. What was his conduct in his praetor|&s;hip here at home? Let the plundered temples, and public works neglected, that he might embezzle the money intended for carrying them on, bear witne&s;s. How did he di&s;charge the office of a judge? Let tho&s;e who &s;uffered by his inju&s;tice an&s;wer. But his praetor|&s;hip in Sicily crowns all his works of wickedne&s;s, and fini&s;hes a la&s;ting monument to his infamy. The mi&s;|chiefs done by him in that unhappy country, during the three years of his iniquitous admini&s;tration, are &s;uch, that many years, under the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of praetors, will not be &s;ufficient to re&s;tore things to the condition in which he found them: for it is noto|rious, that, during the time of his tyranny, the Si|cilians neither enjoyed the protection of their own original laws; of the regulations made for their benefit by the Roman &s;enate, upon their coming under the pro|tection of the commonwealth; nor of the natural and
<PB N="155" REF="035851_0192_1007AB48F4BBC950">
unalienable rights of men. His nod has decided all cau&s;es in Sicily for the&s;e three years. And his de|ci&s;ions have broken all law, all precedent, all right. The &s;ums he has, by arbitrary taxes and unheard of impo&s;itions, extorted from the indu&s;trious poor, are not to be computed. The mo&s;t faithful allies of the commonwealth have been treated as enemies. Roman citizens have, like &s;laves, been put to death with tor|tures. The mo&s;t atrocious criminals, for money, have been exempted from the de&s;erved puni&s;hments; and men of the mo&s;t unexceptionable characters, con|demned and bani&s;hed unheard. The harbours, though &s;ufficiently fortified, and the gates of &s;trong towns, have been opened to pirates and ravagers. The &s;oldiery and &s;ailors, belonging to a province under the pro|tection of the commonwealth, have been &s;tarved to death. Whole fleets, to the great detriment of the province, &s;uffered to peri&s;h. The ancient monuments of either Sicilian or Roman greatne&s;s, the &s;tatues of heroes and princes have been carried off; and the temples &s;tripped of the images.&mdash;Having, by his ini|quitous &s;entences, filled the pri&s;ons with the mo&s;t in|du&s;trious and de&s;erving of the people, he then pro|ceeded to order numbers of Roman citizens to be &s;trangled in the gaols: &s;o that the exclamation, "I am a citizen of Rome!" which has often, in the mo&s;t di&s;tant regions, and among the mo&s;t barbarous people, been a protection, was of no &s;ervice to them; but, on the contrary, brought a &s;peedier and more &s;evere pu|ni&s;hment upon them.</P>
<P>I a&s;k now, Verres, what thou ha&s;t to advance again&s;t this charge? Wilt thou pretend to deny it? Wilt thou pretend, that any thing fal&s;e, that even any thing
<PB N="156" REF="035851_0193_1007AB4B553CEB90">
aggravated, is alleged again&s;t thee? Had any prince, or any &s;tate, committed the &s;ame outrage again&s;t the privilege of Roman citizens, &s;hould we not think we had &s;ufficient ground for demanding &s;atisfaction? What puni&s;hment ought, then, to be inflicted upon a tyran|nical and wicked praetor, who dared, at no greater di&s;tance than Sicily, within &s;ight of the Italian coa&s;t, to put to the infamous death of crucifixion, that unfor|tunate and innocent citizen, Publius Gavius Co&s;anus, only for his having a&s;&s;erted his privilege of citizen|&s;hip, and declared his intention of appealing to the ju&s;tice of his country, again&s;t a cruel oppre&s;&s;or, who had unju&s;tly confined him in pri&s;on at Syracu&s;e, whence he had ju&s;t made his e&s;cape? The unhappy man, arre&s;ted as he was going to embark for his native country, is brought before the wicked praetor. With eyes darting fury, and a countenance di&s;torted with cruelty, he orders the helple&s;s victim of his rage to be &s;tripped, and rods to be brought; accu&s;ing him, but without the lea&s;t &s;hadow of evidence, or even of &s;u&s;|picion, of having come to Sicily, as a &s;py. It was in vain that the unhappy man cried out, "I am a Ro|man citizen: I have &s;erved under Lucius Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tius, who is now at Panormus, and will atte&s;t my inno|cence." The blood-thir&s;ty praetor, deaf to all he could urge in his own defence, ordered the infamous puni&s;h|ment to be inflicted. Thus, Fathers, was an innocent Roman citizen publicly mangled with &s;courging; whil&s;t the only words he uttered, amid&s;t his cruel &s;uf|ferings, were, "I am a Roman citizen!" With the&s;e he hoped to defend him&s;elf from violence and infamy. But of &s;o little &s;ervice was this privilege to him, that, while he was thus a&s;&s;erting his citizen&s;hip, the order
<PB N="157" REF="035851_0194_100792301B703738">
was given for his execution,&mdash;for his execution upon the cro&s;s!&mdash;</P>
<P>O liberty!&mdash;O &s;ound once delightful to every Ro|man ear!&mdash;O &s;acred privilege of Roman citizen&s;hip!&mdash;once &s;acred!&mdash;now trampled upon!&mdash;But what then? Is it come to this? Shall an inferior magi&s;trate, a go|vernour, who holds his whole power of the Roman people, in a Roman province, within &s;ight of Italy, bind, &s;courge, torture with fire and red hot plates of iron, and at la&s;t put to the infamous death of the cro&s;s, a Roman citizen? Shall neither the cries of innocence expiring in agony, nor the tears of pitying &s;pectators, nor the maje&s;ty of the Roman commonwealth, nor the fear of the ju&s;tice of his country, re&s;train the licentious and wanton cruelty of a mon&s;ter, who, in confidence of his riches, &s;trikes at the root of liberty, and &s;ets mankind at defiance?</P>
<P>I conclude with expre&s;&s;ing my hopes, that your wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice, Fathers, will not, by &s;uffering the atrocious and unexampled in&s;olence of Caius Verres to e&s;cape due puni&s;hment, leave room to apprehend the danger of a total &s;ubver&s;ion of authority, and the in|troduction of general anarchy and confu&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. Speech of Adherbal to the Roman Senate, imploring their protection again&s;t Jugurtha.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FATHERS!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is known to you, that king Micip&s;a, my father, on his death-bed, left in charge to Jugurtha, his adopted &s;on, conjunctly with my unfortunate brother Hiemp&s;al
<PB N="158" REF="035851_0195_1007AB5110DC2980">
and my&s;elf, the children of his own body, the admini|&s;tration of the kingdom of Numidia, directing us to con&s;ider the &s;enate and people of Rome as proprietors of it. He charged us to u&s;e our be&s;t endeavours to be &s;erviceable to the Roman commonwealth; a&s;&s;uring us, that your protection would prove a defence again&s;t all enemies; and would be in&s;tead of armies, fortifications, and trea&s;ures.</P>
<P>While my brother and I were thinking of nothing but how to regulate our&s;elves according to the direc|tions of our decea&s;ed father&mdash;Jugurtha&mdash;the mo&s;t in|famous of mankind!&mdash;breaking through all ties of gra|titude and of common humanity, and trampling on the authority of the Roman commonwealth, procured the murder of my unfortunate brother; and has driven me from my throne and native country, though he knows I inherit, from my grandfather Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a, and my father Micip&s;a, the friend&s;hip and alliance of the Romans.</P>
<P>For a prince to be reduced, by villany, to my di&s;|tre&s;sful circum&s;tances, is calamity enough; but my misfortunes are heightened by the con&s;ideration&mdash;that I find my&s;elf obliged to &s;olicit your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, Fathers, for the &s;ervices done you by my ance&s;tors, not for any I have been able to render you in my own per&s;on. Jugurtha has put it out of my power to de&s;erve any thing at your hands; and has forced me to be burden|&s;ome, before I could be u&s;eful to you. And yet, if I had no plea, but my unde&s;erved mi&s;ery&mdash;a once pow|erful prince, the de&s;cendent of a race of illu&s;trious mo|narchs, now, without any fault of my own, de&s;titute of every &s;upport, and reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of begging foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, again&s;t an enemy who has &s;eized my throne and my kingdom&mdash;if my unequalled di&s;|tre&s;&s;es
<PB N="159" REF="035851_0196_1007AB52992D1180">
were all I had to plead&mdash;it would become the greatne&s;s of the Roman commonwealth, to protect the injured, and to check the triumph of daring wickedne&s;s over helple&s;s innocence. But, to provoke your re&s;ent|ment to the utmo&s;t, Jugurtha has driven me from the very dominions, which the &s;enate and people of Rome gave to my ance&s;tors; and, from which, my grandfather, and my father, under your umbrage, expelled Syphax and the Carthaginians. Thus, Fathers, your kindne&s;s to our family is defeated; and Jugurtha, in injuring me, throws contempt upon you.</P>
<P>O wretched prince! Oh cruel rever&s;e of fortune! Oh father Micip&s;a! is this the con&s;equence of thy genero&s;ity; that he, whom thy goodne&s;s rai&s;ed to an equality with thy own children, &s;hould be the murderer of thy children? Mu&s;t, then, the royal hou&s;e of Nu|midia always be a &s;cene of havoc and blood? While Carthage remained, we &s;uffered, as was to be expected, all &s;orts of hard&s;hips from their ho&s;tile attacks; our enemy near; our only powerful ally, the Roman commonwealth, at a di&s;tance. When that &s;courge of Africa was no more, we congratulated our&s;elves on the pro&s;pect of e&s;tabli&s;hed peace. But, in&s;tead of peace, behold the kingdom of Numidia drenched with royal blood! and the only &s;urviving &s;on of its late king, flying from an adopted murderer, and &s;eeking that &s;afety in foreign parts, which he cannot command in his own kingdom.</P>
<P>Whither&mdash;Oh! whither &s;hall I fly? If I return to the royal palace of my ance&s;tors, my father's throne is &s;eized by the murderer of my brother. What can I there expect, but that Jugurtha &s;hould ha&s;ten to imbrue, in my blood, tho&s;e hands which are now reeking with
<PB N="160" REF="035851_0197_1007AB55952A3680">
my brother's? If I were to fly for refuge, or for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to any other court, from what prince can I hope for protection, if the Roman commonwealth give me up? From my own family or friends I have no expectations. My royal father is no more. He is beyond the reach of violence, and out of hearing of the complaints of his unhappy &s;on. Were my brother alive, our mutual &s;ympathy would be &s;ome alleviation. But he is hurried out of life, in his early youth, by the very hand which &s;hould have been the la&s;t to injure any of the royal family of Numidia. The bloody Jugurtha has butchered all whom he &s;u&s;pected to be in my in|tere&s;t. Some have been de&s;troyed by the lingering torment of the cro&s;s. Others have been given a prey to wild bea&s;ts; and their angui&s;h made the &s;port of men more cruel than wild bea&s;ts. If there be any yet alive, they are &s;hut up in dungeons, there to drag out a life more intolerable than death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Look down, illu&s;trious &s;enators of Rome! from that height of power to which you are rai&s;ed, on the un|exampled di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a prince, who is, by the cruelty of a wicked intruder, become an outca&s;t from all man|kind. Let not the crafty in&s;inuations of him who re|turns murder for adoption, prejudice your judgment. Do not li&s;ten to the wretch who has butchered the &s;on and relations of a king, who gave him power to &s;it on the &s;ame throne with his own &s;ons.&mdash;I have been in|formed; that he labours by his emi&s;&s;aries to prevent your determining any thing again&s;t him in his ab&s;ence; pretending that I magnify my di&s;tre&s;s, and might, for him, have &s;taid in peace in my own kingdom. But if ever the time comes, when the due vengeance from above &s;hall overtake him, he will then di&s;&s;emble as I do. Then he, who now, hardened in wickedne&s;s,
<PB N="161" REF="035851_0198_1007AB57F6BCE4C8">
triumphs over tho&s;e whom his violence has laid low, will, in his turn, feel di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;uffer for his impious ingratitude to my father, and his blood-thir&s;ty cruelty to my brother.</P>
<P>Oh murdered, butchered brother! Oh deare&s;t to my heart&mdash;now gone for ever from my &s;ight!&mdash;but why &s;hould I lament his death? He is, indeed, deprived of the ble&s;&s;ed light of heaven, of life, and kingdom, at once, by the very per&s;on who ought to have been the fir&s;t to hazard his own life, in defence of any one of Micip&s;a's family. But, as things are, my brother is not &s;o much deprived of the&s;e comforts, as delivered from terror, from flight, from exile, and the endle&s;s train of mi&s;eries which render life to me a burden. He lies full low, gored with wounds, and fe&s;tering in his own blood. But he lies in peace. He feels none of the mi&s;eries which rend my &s;oul with agony and di&s;trac|tion, while I am &s;et up a &s;pectacle to all mankind, of the uncertainty of human affairs. So far from having it in my power to puni&s;h his murderer, I am not ma&s;|ter of the means of &s;ecuring my own life. So far from being in a condition to defend my kingdom from the violence of the u&s;urper, I am obliged to apply for fo|reign protection for my own per&s;on.</P>

<P>Whereupon, O king Agrippa! I was not di&s;obedient to the heavenly vi&s;ion: but &s;howed fir&s;t to them of Dama&s;cus, and at Jeru&s;alem, and through all the coa&s;ts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they &s;hould repent, and turn to God, and do works meet for re|pentance. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the&s;e cau&s;es, the Jews caught me in the temple; and went about to kill me.

<HEAD>SECTION IV. Lord Mansfield's Speech in the Hou&s;e of Lords, 1770, on the Bill for preventing the Delays of Ju&s;tice, by claim|ing the Privilege of Parliament.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I con&s;ider the importance of this bill to your Lord&s;hips, I am not &s;urpri&s;ed it has taken up &s;o much of your con&s;ideration. It is a bill, indeed, of no com|mon magnitude; it is no le&s;s than to take away from two thirds of the legi&s;lative body of this great king|dom, certain privileges and immunities of which they have been long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Perhaps there is no &s;itua|tion the human mind can be placed in, that is &s;o diffi|cult and &s;o trying, as when it is made a judge in its own cau&s;e. There is &s;omething implanted in the brea&s;t of man &s;o attached to &s;elf, &s;o tenacious of privileges once obtained, that, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, either to di&s;|cu&s;s with impartiality, or decide with ju&s;tice, has ever been held the &s;ummit of all human virtue. The bill now in que&s;tion puts your Lord&s;hips in this very pre|dicament; and I doubt not but the wi&s;dom of your de|ci&s;ion will convince the world, that where &s;elf-intere&s;t and ju&s;tice are in oppo&s;ite &s;cales, the latter will ever preponderate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> your Lord&s;hips.</P>
<P>Privileges have been granted to legi&s;lators in all ages, and in all countries. The practice is founded in wi&s;|dom; and indeed, it is peculiarly e&s;&s;ential to the con|&s;titution of this country, that the members of both Hou&s;es &s;hould be free in their per&s;ons, in ca&s;es of civil &s;uits: for there may come a time when the &s;afety and
<PB N="166" REF="035851_0203_1007ABC514989D10">
welfare of this whole empire, may depend upon their attendance in parliament. I am far from advi&s;ing any mea&s;ure that would in future endanger the &s;tate: but the bill before your Lord&s;hips has, I am confident, no &s;uch tendency; for it expre&s;sly &s;ecures the per&s;ons of members of either Hou&s;e in all civil &s;uits. This being the ca&s;e, I confe&s;s, when I &s;ee many noble lords, for who&s;e judgment I have a very great re&s;pect, &s;tanding up to oppo&s;e a bill which is calculated merely to faci|litate the recovery of ju&s;t and legal debts, I am a&s;to|ni&s;hed and amazed. They, I doubt not, oppo&s;e the bill upon public principles: I would not wi&s;h to in|&s;inuate, that private intere&s;t had the lea&s;t weight in their determination.</P>
<P>The bill has been frequently propo&s;ed, and as fre|quently has mi&s;carried: but it was always lo&s;t in the Lower Hou&s;e. Little did I think, when it had pa&s;&s;ed the Commons, that it po&s;&s;ibly could have met with &s;uch op|po&s;ition here. Shall it be &s;aid, that you, my Lords, the grand council of the nation, the highe&s;t judicial and le|gi&s;lative body of the realm, endeavour to evade, by privilege, tho&s;e very laws which you enforce on your fellow-&s;ubjects? Forbid it Ju&s;tice!&mdash;I am &s;ure, were the noble Lords as well acquainted as I am, with but half the difficulties and delays occa&s;ioned in the courts of ju&s;tice, under pretence of privilege, they would not, nay they could not, oppo&s;e this bill.</P>
<P>I have waited with patience to he what arguments might be urged again&s;t the bill; but I have waited in vain: the truth is, there is no argument that can weigh again&s;t it. The ju&s;tice and expediency of the bill are &s;uch as render it &s;elf-evident. It is a propo&s;ition of that nature, that can neither be weak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ned by argument,
<PB N="167" REF="035851_0204_1007ABC76ED67698">
nor entangled with &s;ophi&s;try. Much, indeed, has been &s;aid by &s;ome noble lords, on the wi&s;dom of our ance&s;|tors, and how differently they thought from us. They not only decreed, that privilege &s;hould prevent all civil &s;uits from proceeding during the &s;itting of parliament, but likewi&s;e granted protection to the very &s;ervants of members. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing on the wi&s;dom of our an|ce&s;tors; it might perhaps appear invidious: that is not nece&s;&s;ary in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that the noble Lords who flatter them&s;elves with the weight of that reflection, &s;hould remember, that as circum&s;tances alter, things them&s;elves &s;hould alter. Formerly, it was not &s;o fa&s;hionable either for ma&s;ters or &s;ervants to run in debt, as it is at pre&s;ent. Formerly, we were not that great commercial nation we are at pre&s;ent; nor for|merly were merchants and manufacturers members of parliament, as at pre&s;ent. The ca&s;e is now very dif|ferent: both merchants and manufacturers are, with great propriety, elected members of the Lower Hou&s;e. Commerce having thus got into the legi&s;lative body of the kingdom, privilege mu&s;t be done away. We all know, that the very &s;oul and e&s;&s;ence of trade are re|gular payments; and &s;ad experience teaches us, that there are men, who will not make their regular pay|ments without the compul&s;ive power of the laws. The law then ought to be equally open to all. Any exemption to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rticular men, or particular ranks of men, is, in a free and commercial country, a &s;oleci&s;m of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t nature.</P>
<P>But I will not trouble your Lord&s;hips with arguments for that, which is &s;ufficiently evident without any. I &s;hall only &s;ay a few words to &s;ome noble lords, who fore&s;ee much inconveniency, from the per&s;ons of their
<PB N="168" REF="035851_0205_1007ABC8F7221708">
&s;ervants being liable to be arre&s;ted. One noble lord ob&s;erves, That the coachman of a peer may be ar|re&s;ted, while he is driving his ma&s;ter to the Hou&s;e, and, that, con&s;equently, he will not be able to attend his duty in parliament. If this were actually to happen, there are &s;o many methods by which the member might &s;till get to the Hou&s;e, that I can hardly think the noble lord is &s;erious in his objection. Another noble peer &s;aid, That, by this bill, one might lo&s;e his mo&s;t valuable and hone&s;t &s;ervants. This I hold to be a contradiction in terms! for he can neither be a valuable &s;ervant, nor an hone&s;t man, who gets into debt which he is neither able nor willing to pay, till compelled by the law. If my &s;ervant, by unfore&s;een accidents, has got into debt, and I &s;till wi&s;h to retain him, I certainly would pay the demand. But upon no principal of liberal legi&s;la|tion whatever, can my &s;ervant have a title to &s;et his creditors at defiance, while for forty &s;hillings only, the hone&s;t trade&s;man may be torn from his family, and locked up in a gaol. It is mon&s;trous inju&s;tice! I flatter my&s;elf, however, the determination of this day will en|tirely put an end to all &s;uch partial proceedings for the future, by pa&s;&s;ing into a law the bill now under your Lord&s;hips' con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;peak, upon what, indeed, I would have gladly avoided, had I not been particularly point|ed at, for the part I have taken in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill. It has been &s;aid, by a noble lord on my left hand, that I likewi&s;e am running the race of popularity. If the noble Lord means by popularity, that applau&s;e be&s;towed by after|ages on good and virtuous actions, I have long been &s;truggling in that race: to what purpo&s;e, all-trying Time can alone determine. But if the noble lord
<PB N="169" REF="035851_0206_1007ABCB567D9180">
means that mu&s;hroom popularity, which is rai&s;ed with|out merit, and lo&s;t without a crime, he is much mi&s;taken in his opinion. I defy the noble Lord to point out a &s;ingle action of my life, in which the popularity of the times ever had the &s;malle&s;t influence on my determina|tions. I thank God I have a more permanent and &s;teady rule for my conduct,&mdash;the dictates of my own brea&s;t. They who have foregone that plea&s;ing advi&s;er, and given up their mind to be the &s;lave of every popu|lar impul&s;e, I &s;incerely pity: I pity them &s;till more, if their vanity leads them to mi&s;take the &s;houts of a mob, for the trumpet of Fame. Experience might inform them, that many, who have been &s;aluted with the huzzas of a crowd one day, have received their execrations the next; and many, who, by the popularity of their times, have been held up as &s;potle&s;s patriots, have, ne|verthele&s;s, appeared upon the hi&s;torian's page, when truth has triumphed over delu&s;ion, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of li|berty. Why then the noble lord can think I am am|bitious of pre&s;ent popularity, that echo of folly, and &s;hadow of renown, I am at a lo&s;s to determine. Be|&s;ides, I do not know that the bill now before your Lord|&s;hips will be popular: it depends much upon the caprice of the day. It may not be popular to compel people to pay their debts; and, in that ca&s;e, the pre&s;ent mu&s;t be a very unpopular bill. It may not be popular nei|ther to take away any of the privileges of parliament; for I very well remember, and many of your Lord&s;hips may remember, that, not long ago, the popular cry was for the exten&s;ion of privilege; and &s;o far did they carry it at that time, that it was &s;aid, the privilege protected members even in criminal actions; nay, &s;uch was the power of popular prejudices over weak minds, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="170" REF="035851_0207_1007ABCEE00386B0">
very deci&s;ions of &s;ome of the courts were tinctured with that doctrine. It was u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">doubtedly an abominable doctrine; I thought &s;o then, and I think &s;o &s;till; but, neverthele&s;s, it was a popular doctrine, and came immediately from tho&s;e who are called the friends of liberty; how de&s;ervedly, time will &s;how. True liber|ty, in my opinion, can only exi&s;t when ju&s;tice equally admini&s;tered to all; to the king and to the beggar. Where is the ju&s;tice then, or where is the law that protects a member of parliament more than any other man, from the puni&s;hment due to his crimes? The laws of this country allow of no place, nor any employment, to be a &s;anctuary for crimes; and where I have the honour to &s;it as judge, neither royal favour, nor popular applau&s;e, &s;hall ever protect the guilty.</P>
<P>I have now only to beg pardon for having employed &s;o much of your Lord&s;hips' time; and I am &s;orry a bill, fraught with &s;o many good con&s;equences, has not met with an abler advocate: but I doubt not your Lord&s;hips' determination will convince the world, that a bill, cal|culated to contribute &s;o much to the equal di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice as the pre&s;ent, requires with your Lord&s;hips but very little &s;upport.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. An Addre&s;s to young Per&s;ons.</HEAD>
<P>I INTEND, in this addre&s;s, to &s;how you the import|ance of beginning early to give &s;erious attention to your conduct. As &s;oon as you are capable of re|flection, you mu&s;t perceive that there is a right and a wrong, in human actions. You &s;ee, that tho&s;e who
<PB N="171" REF="035851_0208_1007ABD155B4A018">
are born with the &s;ame advantages of fortune, are not all equally pro&s;perous in the cour&s;e of life. While &s;ome of them, by wi&s;e and &s;teady conduct, attain di&s;|tinction in the world, and pa&s;s their days with comfort and honour; others, of the &s;ame rank, by mean and vicious behaviour, forfeit the advantages of their birth; involve them&s;elves in much mi&s;ery; and end in being a di&s;grace to their friends, and a burden on &s;ociety. Early, then, may you learn, that it is not on the ex|ternal condition in which you find your&s;elves placed, but on the part which you are to act, that your welfare or unhappine&s;s, your honour or infamy, depends. Now, when beginning to act that part, what can be of greater moment, than to regulate your plan of con|duct with the mo&s;t &s;erious attention, before you have yet committed any fatal or irretrievable errors? If, in&s;tead of exerting reflection for this valuable purpo&s;e, you deliver your&s;elves up, at &s;o critical a time, to &s;loth and plea&s;ure; if you refu&s;e to li&s;ten to any coun&s;ellor but humour, or to attend to any pur&s;uit except that of amu&s;ement; if you allow your&s;elves to float loo&s;e and carele&s;s on the tide of life, ready to receive any direc|tion which the current of fa&s;hion may chance to give you; what can you expect to follow from &s;uch begin|nings? While &s;o many around you are undergoing the &s;ad con&s;equences of a like indi&s;cretion, for what rea&s;on &s;hall not tho&s;e con&s;equences extend to you? Shall you attain &s;ucce&s;s without that preparation, and e&s;cape dangers without that precaution, which is re|quired of others? Shall happine&s;s grow up to you, of its own accord, and &s;olicit your acceptance, when, to the re&s;t of mankind, it is the fruit of long cultivation, and the acqui&s;ition of labour and care?&mdash;Deceive
<PB N="172" REF="035851_0209_1007ABD2DFB49B90">
not your&s;elves with &s;uch arrogant hopes. Whatever be your rank, Providence will not, for your &s;ake, rever&s;e its e&s;tabli&s;hed order. The Author of your being hath enjoined you to "take heed to your ways; to ponder the paths of your feet; to remember your Creator in the days of your youth." He hath decreed, that they only "who &s;eek after wi&s;dom, &s;hall find it; that fools &s;hall be afflicted, becau&s;e of their tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions; and that whoever refu&s;eth in&s;truction, &s;hall de|&s;troy his own &s;oul." By li&s;tening to the&s;e admonitions, and tempering the vivacity of youth with a proper mix|ture of &s;erious thought, you may en&s;ure cheerfulne&s;s for the re&s;t of life; but by delivering your&s;elves up at pre&s;ent to giddine&s;s and levity, you lay the foundation of la&s;ting heavine&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>When you look forward to tho&s;e plans of life, which either your circum&s;tances have &s;ugge&s;ted, or your friends have propo&s;ed, you will not he&s;itate to acknow|ledge, that in order to pur&s;ue them with advantage, &s;ome previous di&s;cipline is requi&s;ite. Be a&s;&s;ured, that whatever is to be your profe&s;&s;ion, no education is more nece&s;&s;ary to your &s;ucce&s;s, than the acquirement of virtuous di&s;po&s;itions and habits. This is the uni|ver&s;al preparation for every character, and every &s;tation in life. Bad as the world is, re&s;pect is always paid to virtue. In the u&s;ual cour&s;e of human affairs, it will be found, that a plain under&s;tanding, joined with acknowledged worth, contributes more to pro|&s;perity, than the brighte&s;t parts without probity or honour. Whether &s;cience or bu&s;ine&s;s, or public life, be your aim, virtue &s;till enter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a principal &s;hare, into all tho&s;e great departments of &s;ociety. It is con|nected with eminence, in every liberal art; with re|putation
<PB N="173" REF="035851_0210_100792484E2D3620">
in every branch of fair and u&s;eful bu&s;ine&s;s; with di&s;tinction, in every public &s;tation. The vigour which it gives the mind, and the weight which it adds to character; the generous &s;entiments which it breathes; the undaunted &s;pirit which it in&s;pires; the ardour of diligence which it quickens; the freedom which it pro|cures from pernicious and di&s;honourable avocations; are the foundations of all that is highly honourable, or greatly &s;ucce&s;sful among men.</P>
<P>Whatever ornamental or engaging endowments you now po&s;&s;e&s;s, virtue is a nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ite, in order to their &s;hining with proper lu&s;tre. Feeble are the attractions of the faire&s;t form, if it be &s;u&s;pected that nothing within corre&s;ponds to the plea&s;ing appearance without. Short are the triumphs of wit, when it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the vehicle of malice. By whatever means you may at fir&s;t attract the attention, you can hold the e&s;teem, and &s;ecure the hearts of others, only by amiable di&s;po&s;itions, and the accompli&s;hments of the mind. The&s;e are the qualities who&s;e influence will la&s;t, when the lu&s;tre of all that once &s;parkled and dazzled has pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>Let not then the &s;ea&s;on of youth be barren of im|provements, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to your future felicity and honour. Now is the &s;eed-time of life; and according to "what you &s;ow, you &s;hall reap." Your character is now, under Divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, of your own form|ing; your fate is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, put into your own hands. Your nature is as yet pliant and &s;oft. Habits have not e&s;tabli&s;hed their dominion. Prejudices have not pre-occupied your under&s;tanding. The world has not had time to contract and deba&s;e your affections. All your powers are more vigorous, di&s;embarra&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="174" REF="035851_0211_1007ABD543E6CB68">
and free, than they will be at any future period. Whatever impul&s;e you now give to your de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions, the direction is likely to continue. It will form the channel in which your life is to run; nay, it may determine its everla&s;ting i&s;&s;ue. Con&s;ider then the employment of this important period, as the highe&s;t tru&s;t which &s;hall ever be committed to you; as in a great mea&s;ure, deci&s;ive of your happine&s;s, in time, and in eternity. As in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the &s;ea&s;ons, each, by the invariable laws of Nature, affects the productions of what is next in cour&s;e; &s;o, in human life, every period of our age, according as it is well or ill &s;pent, influences the happine&s;s of that which is to follow. Virtuous youth gradually brings forward accompli&s;hed and flouri&s;hing manhood; and &s;uch man|hood pa&s;&s;es of it&s;elf, without unea&s;ine&s;s, into re&s;pect|able and tranquil old age. But when nature is turned out of its regular cour&s;e, di&s;order takes place in the moral, ju&s;t as in the vegetable world. If the Spring put forth no blo&s;&s;oms, in Summer there will be no beauty, and in Autumn, no fruit. So, if youth be trifled away without improvement, manhood will pro|bably be contemptible, and old age mi&s;erable. If the beginnings of life have been "vanity," its latter end can &s;carcely be any other than "vexation of &s;pirit."</P>
<P>I &s;hall fini&s;h this addre&s;s, with calling your attention to that dependence on the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, which, amid&s;t all your endeavours after improvement, you ought continually to pre&s;erve. It is too common with the young, even when they re&s;olve to tread the path of virtue and honour, to &s;et out with pre&s;umptuous confidence in them&s;elves. Tru&s;ting to their own abi|lities for carrying them &s;ucce&s;sfully through life, they
<PB N="175" REF="035851_0212_1007ABD890DAC220">
are carele&s;s of applying to God, or of deriving any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from what they are apt to reckon the gloomy di&s;cipline of religion. Alas! how little do they know the dangers which await them! Neither human wi&s;|dom, nor human virtue, un&s;upported by religion, is equal to the trying &s;ituations which often occur in life. By the &s;hock of temptation, how frequently have the mo&s;t virtuous intentions been overthrown! Under the pre&s;&s;ure of di&s;a&s;ter, how often has the great|e&s;t con&s;tancy &s;unk! "Every good, and every perfect gift is from above." Wi&s;dom and virtue, as well as "riches and honour, come from God." De&s;titute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his favour, you are in no better &s;ituation, with all your boa&s;ted abilities, than orphans left to wander in a trackle&s;s de&s;ert, without any guide to conduct them, or any &s;helter to cover them from the gathering &s;torm. Correct, then, this ill-founded arrogance. Expect not, that your happine&s;s can be independent of him who made you. By faith and repentance, apply to the Redeemer of the world. By piety and prayer, &s;eek the protection of the God of heaven. I conclude with the &s;olemn words, in which a great prince de|livered his dying charge to his &s;on; words, which every young per&s;on ought to con&s;ider as addre&s;&s;ed to him&s;elf, and to engrave deeply on his heart: "Solo|mon, my &s;on, know thou the God of thy fathers; and &s;erve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind. For the Lord &s;earcheth all hearts, and under|&s;tandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou &s;eek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou for|&s;ake him, he will ca&s;t thee off for ever."</P>

<P>AN account of this dreadful earthquake, is given by the celebrated Father Kircher. It happened whil&s;t he was on his journey to vi&s;it Mount AEtna, and the re&s;t of the wonders that lie towards the &s;outh of Italy. Kircher is con&s;idered by &s;cholars, as one of the great|e&s;t prodigies of learning.</P>
<P>"Having hired a boat, in company with four more, (two friars of the order of St. Francis, and two &s;eculars,) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> launched, from the harbour of Me&s;&s;ina, in Sicily; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd arrived, the &s;ame day, at the promontory of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e|lorus. Our de&s;tination was for the city of Euphaemia, in Calabria; where we had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act; and where we de&s;igned to tarry for &s;ome time. How|ever, Providence &s;eemed willing to cro&s;s our de&s;ign; for we were obliged to continue three days at Pelorus, on account of the weather: and though we often put out to &s;ea, yet we were as often driven back. At length, wearied with the delay, we re&s;olved to pro&s;e|cute our voyage; and, although the &s;ea &s;eemed more than u&s;ually agitated, we ventured forward. The gulph of Charybdis, which we approached, &s;eemed

whirled round in &s;uch a manner, as to form a va&s;t hollow, verging to a point in the centre. Proceeding onward, and turning my eyes to AEtna, I &s;aw it ca&s;t forth large volumes of &s;moke, of mountainous &s;izes, which entirely covered the i&s;land, and blotted out the very &s;hores from my view. This, together with the dreadful noi&s;e, and the &s;ulphurous &s;tench which was &s;trongly perceived, filled me with apprehen&s;ions, that &s;ome more dreadful calamity was impending. The &s;ea it&s;elf &s;eemed to wear a very unu&s;ual appearance: they who have &s;een a lake in a violent &s;hower of rain, covered all over with bubbles, will conceive &s;ome idea of its agitations. My &s;urpri&s;e was &s;till increa&s;ed, by the calmne&s;s and &s;erenity of the weather; not a breeze, not a cloud, which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to put all Na|ture thus into motion. I therefore warned my com|panions, that an earthquake was approaching; and, after &s;ome time, making for the &s;hore with all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> diligence, we landed at Tropea, happy and thankf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> for having e&s;caped the threatening dangers of we &s;ea."</P>
<P>"But our triumphs at land were of &s;hort duration; for we had &s;carcely arrived at the Je&s;uits' College, in that city, when our ears were &s;tunned with a horrid &s;ound, re&s;embling that of an infinite number of cha|riots, driven fiercely forward; the wheels rattling, and the thongs cracking. Soon after this, a mo&s;t dreadful earthquake en&s;ued; &s;o that the whole tract upon which we &s;tood, &s;eemed to vibrate, as if we were in the &s;cale of a balance, that continued wavering. This motion, however, &s;oon grew more violent; and being no longer able to keep my legs, I was thrown pro&s;trate upon the ground. In the mean time, the univer&s;al ruin round

me redoubled my amazement. The cra&s;h of falling hou&s;es, the tottering of towers, and the groans of the dying, all contributed to rai&s;e my terror and de&s;pair. On every &s;ide of me, I &s;aw nothing but a &s;cene of ruin; and danger threatening wherever I &s;hould fly. I commended my&s;elf to God, as my la&s;t great refuge. At that hour, O how vain was every &s;ublunary happi|ne&s;s! Wealth, honour, empire, wi&s;dom, all mere u&s;e|le&s;s &s;ounds, and as empty as the bubbles in the deep! Ju&s;t &s;tanding on the thre&s;hold of eternity, nothing but God was my plea&s;ure; and the nearer I approached, I only loved him the more. After &s;ome time, how|ever, finding that I remained unhurt, amid&s;t the gene|ral concu&s;&s;ion, I re&s;olved to venture for &s;afety; and running as fa&s;t as I could, I reached the &s;hore, but al|mo&s;t terrified out of my rea&s;on. I did not &s;earch long here, till I found the boat in which I had landed; and my companions al&s;o, who&s;e terrors were even greater <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">han mine. Our meeting was not of that kind, where (two) y one is de&s;irous of telling his own happy e&s;cape: we was all &s;ilence, and a gloomy dread of impending <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">terrors."</P>
<P>"Leaving this &s;eat of de&s;olation, we pro&s;ecuted our voyage along the coa&s;t; and the next day came to Rochetta, where we landed, although the earth &s;till continued in violent agitations. But we were &s;carcely arrived at our inn, when we were once more obliged to return to the boat; and, in about half an hour, we &s;aw the greater part of the town, and the inn at which we had &s;et up, da&s;hed to the ground, and burying the inhabitants beneath the ruins."</P>
<P>"In this manner, proceeding onward in our little ve&s;&s;el, finding no &s;afety at land, and yet, from the
<PB N="179" REF="035851_0216_1007ABE24D4C4C00">
&s;mallne&s;s of our boat, having but a very dangerous con|tinuance at &s;ea, we at length landed at Lopizium, a ca&s;tle midway between Tropaea and Euphaemia, the city to which, as I &s;aid before, we were bound. Here, wherever I turned my eyes, nothing but &s;cenes of ruin and horror appeared; towns and ca&s;tles levelled to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ground; Strombalo, though at &s;ixty miles di&s;tance, belching forth flames in an unu&s;ual manner, and with a noi&s;e which I could di&s;tinctly hear. But my attention was quickly turned from more remote, to contiguous danger. The rumbling &s;ound of an approaching earthquake, which we by this time were grown ac|quainted with, alarmed us for the con&s;equences; it every moment &s;eemed to grow louder, and to ap|proach nearer. The place on which we &s;tood now began to &s;hake mo&s;t dreadfully; &s;o that being unable to &s;tand, my companions and I caught hold of what|ever &s;hrub grew next to us, and &s;upported our&s;elves in that manner."</P>
<P>"After &s;ome time, this violent paroxy&s;m cea&s;ing, we again &s;tood up, in order to pro&s;ecute our voyage to Euphaemia, which lay within &s;ight. In the mean time, while we were preparing for this purpo&s;e, I turned my eyes towards the city, but could &s;ee only a fright|ful dark cloud, that &s;eemed to re&s;t upon the place. This the more &s;urpri&s;ed us, as the weather was &s;o very &s;erene. We waited therefore, till the cloud had pa&s;&s;ed away; then turning to look <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the city, it was to|tally &s;unk. Wonderful to tell! nothing but a di&s;mal and putrid lake was &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> where it &s;tood. We looked about to find &s;ome one that could tell us of its &s;ad cata&s;trophe, but could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no per&s;on. All was become a melancholy &s;olitude; a &s;cene of hideous de&s;olation.
<PB N="180" REF="035851_0217_1007ABE4A9B9EA50">
Thus proceeding pen&s;ively along, in que&s;t of &s;ome human being that could give us a little information, we at length &s;aw a boy &s;itting by the &s;hore, and ap|pearing &s;tupified with terror. Of him, therefore, we inquired concerning the fate of the city; but he could not be prevailed on to give us an an&s;wer. We en|treated him, with every expre&s;&s;ion of tenderne&s;s and pity, to tell us; but his &s;en&s;es were quite wrapt up in the contemplation of the danger he had e&s;caped. We offered him &s;ome victuals, but he &s;eemed to loath the &s;ight. We &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in our offices <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f kindne&s;s; but he only pointed to the place of the city, like one out of his &s;en&s;es; and then running up into the woods, was never heard of after. Such was the fate of the city of Euphaemia&punc; and as we continued our melan|choly cour&s;e along the &s;hore, the whole coa&s;t, for the &s;pace of two hundred miles, pre&s;ented nothing but the remains of cities; and men &s;cattered, without a habi|tation, over the fields. Proceeding thus along, we at length ended our di&s;tre&s;sful voyage, by arriving at Naples, after having e&s;caped a thou&s;and dangers both at &s;ea and land."</P>

for clemency them&s;elves, is of all virtues the mo&s;t becoming.

life! She had all the wi&s;dom of age, and di&s;cretion of a matron, joined with youthful &s;weetne&s;s and virgin mode&s;ty. With what an engaging fondne&s;s did &s;he behave to her father! How kindly and re&s;pectfully re|ceive his friends! How affectionately treat all tho&s;e who, in their re&s;pective offices, had the care and edu|cation of her! She employed much of her time in reading, in which &s;he di&s;covered great &s;trength of judgment; &s;he indulged her&s;elf in few diver&s;ions, and tho&s;e with much caution. With what forbearance, with what patience, with what courage did &s;he endure her la&s;t illne&s;s! She complied with all the directions of her phy&s;icians; &s;he encouraged her &s;i&s;ter, and her father; and, when all her &s;trength of body was ex|hau&s;ted, &s;upported her&s;elf by the &s;ingle vigour of her mind. That, indeed, continued, even to her la&s;t mo|ments, unbroken by the pain of a long illne&s;s, or the terrors of approaching death; and it is a reflection which makes the lo&s;s of her &s;o much the more to be lamented. A lo&s;s infinitely &s;evere! and more &s;evere by the particular conjuncture in which it happened! She was contracted to a mo&s;t worthy youth; the wedding day was fixed, and we were all invited.&mdash;How &s;ad a change from the highe&s;t joy, to the deepe&s;t &s;orrow!

He is a man of great learning and good &s;en&s;e, who has applied him&s;elf from his earlie&s;t youth, to the noble&s;t and mo&s;t elevated &s;tudies; but all the maxims of fortitude,

<HEAD>SECTION IV. On Di&s;cretion.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE often thought, if the minds of men were laid open, we &s;hould &s;ee but little difference between that of the wi&s;e man, and that of the fool.</P>
<P>There are infinite reveries, numberle&s;s extrava|gances, and a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vanities, which pa&s;s through both. The great difference is, that the fir&s;t knows how to pick and cull his thoughts for con|ver&s;ation,
<PB N="184" REF="035851_0221_1007ABEFE61F9CF0">
by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;ome, and communicating others; whereas the other lets them all indifferently fly out in words. This &s;ort of di&s;cretion, however, has no place in private conver&s;ation between intimate friends. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, the wi&s;e&s;t men very often talk like the weake&s;t; for indeed the talking with a friend is nothing el&s;e but <HI>thinking aloud.</HI></P>
<P>Tully has therefore very ju&s;tly expo&s;ed a precept, delivered by &s;ome ancient writers, That a man &s;hould live with his enemy in &s;uch a manner, as might leave him room to become his friend; and with his friend, in &s;uch a manner, that, if he became his enemy, it &s;hould not be in his power to hurt him. The fir&s;t part of this rule, which regards our behaviour towards an enemy, is indeed very rea&s;onable, as well as very prudential; but the latter part of it, which regards our behaviour towards a friend, favours more of cun|ning than of di&s;cretion; and would cut a man off from the greate&s;t plea&s;ures of life, which are the freedoms of conver&s;ation with a bo&s;om friend. Be&s;ides that, when a friend is turned into an enemy, the world is ju&s;t enough to accu&s;e the perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of the friend, rather than the indi&s;cretion of the per&s;on who con|fided in him.</P>
<P>Di&s;cretion does not only &s;how it&s;elf in words, but in all the circum&s;tances of action; and is like an under-agent of Providence, to guide and direct us in the ordinary concerns of life.</P>
<P>There are many more &s;hining qualities in the mind of man, but there is none &s;o u&s;eful as di&s;cretion. It is this, indeed, which gives a value to all the re&s;t; which &s;ets them at work in their proper times and places; and turns them to the advantage of the per&s;on
<PB N="185" REF="035851_0222_1007ABF2637EC2F0">
who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them. Without it, learning is pedantry, and wit impertinence; virtue it&s;elf looks like weakne&s;s; the be&s;t parts only qualify a man to be more &s;prightly in errors, and active to his own pre|judice.</P>
<P>Di&s;cretion does not only make a man the ma&s;ter of his own parts, but of other men's. The di&s;creet man finds out the talents of tho&s;e he conver&s;es with; and knows how to apply them to proper u&s;es. Accord|ingly, if we look into particular communities and divi&s;ions of men, we may ob&s;erve, that it is the di&s;|creet man, not the witty, nor the learned, nor the brave, who guides the conver&s;ation, and gives mea|&s;ures to the &s;ociety. A man with great talents, but void of di&s;cretion, is like Polyphemus in the fable, &s;trong and blind; endued with an irre&s;i&s;tible force, which, for want of &s;ight, is of no u&s;e to him.</P>
<P>Though a man have all other perfections, and want di&s;cretion, he will be of no great con&s;equence in the world; but if he have this &s;ingle talent in perfection, and but a common &s;hare of others, he may do what he plea&s;es in his particular &s;tation of life.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that I think di&s;cretion the mo&s;t u&s;eful talent a man can be ma&s;ter of, I look upon cun|ning to be the accompli&s;hment of little, mean, unge|nerous minds. Di&s;cretion points out the noble&s;t ends to us; and pur&s;ues the mo&s;t proper and laudable me|thods of attaining them: cunning has only private &s;elfi&s;h aims; and &s;ticks at nothing which may make them &s;ucceed. Di&s;cretion has large and extended views; and, like a well-formed eye, commands a whole horizon: cunning is a kind of &s;hort-&s;ightedne&s;s, that di&s;covers the minute&s;t objects which are near at
<PB N="186" REF="035851_0223_1007ABF5A0292B68">
hand, but is not able to di&s;cern things at a di&s;tance. Di&s;cretion, the more it is di&s;covered, gives a greater authority to the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it; cunning, when it is once detected, lo&s;es its force, and makes a man incapable of bringing about even tho&s;e events which he might have done, had he pa&s;&s;ed only for a plain man. Di&s;cretion is the perfection of rea&s;on; and a guide to us in all the duties of life; cunning is a kind of in&s;tinct, that only looks out after our immediate intere&s;t and welfare. Di&s;cretion is only found in men of &s;trong &s;en&s;e and good under&s;tandings: cunning is often to be met with in brutes them&s;elves; and in per|&s;ons who are but the fewe&s;t removes from them. In &s;hort, cunning is only the mimic of di&s;cretion; and it may pa&s;s upon weak men, in the &s;ame manner as vivacity is often mi&s;taken for wit, and gravity, for wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>The ca&s;t of mind which is natural to a di&s;creet man, makes him look forward into futurity, and con&s;ider what will be his condition millions of ages hence, as well as what it is at pre&s;ent. He knows that the mi&s;ery or happine&s;s which is re&s;erved for him in another world, lo&s;es nothing of its reality by being placed at &s;o great a di&s;tance from him. The objects do not appear little to him becau&s;e they are remote. He con&s;iders, that tho&s;e plea&s;ures and pains which lie hid in eternity, approach nearer to him every mo|ment; and will be pre&s;ent with him in their full weight and mea&s;ure, as much as tho&s;e pains and plea|&s;ures which he feels at this very in&s;tant. For this rea&s;on, he is careful to &s;ecure to him&s;elf that which is the proper happine&s;s of his nature, and the ultimate de&s;ign of his being. He carries his thoughts to the
<PB N="187" REF="035851_0224_1007ABF802C6B950">
end of every action; and con&s;iders the mo&s;t di&s;tant, as well as the mo&s;t immediate effects of it. He &s;uper|&s;edes every little pro&s;pect of gain and advantage which offers it&s;elf here, if he does not find it con|&s;i&s;tent with his views of an hereafter. In a word, his hopes are full of immortality; his &s;chemes are large and glorious; and his conduct &s;uitable to one who knows his true intere&s;t, and how to pur&s;ue it by pro|per methods.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. On the Government of our Thoughts.</HEAD>
<P>A MULTITUDE of ca&s;es occur, in which we are no le&s;s accountable for what we think, than for what we do.</P>
<P>As, fir&s;t, when the introduction of any train of thought depends upon our&s;elves, and is our voluntary act; by turning our attention towards &s;uch objects, awakening &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions, or engaging in &s;uch employ|ments, as we know mu&s;t give a peculiar determination to our thoughts. Next, when thoughts, by whatever accident they may have been originally &s;ugge&s;ted, are indulged with deliberation and complacency. Though the mind has been pa&s;&s;ive in their reception, and, there|fore, free from blame; yet, if it be active in their conti|nuance, the guilt becomes its own. They may have in|truded at fir&s;t, like unbidden gue&s;ts; but if, when enter|ed, they are made welcome, and kindly entertained, the ca&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">he &s;ame as if they had been invited from the be|ginning. If we be thus accountable to God for thoughts either voluntarily introduced, or deliberately indulged,
<PB N="188" REF="035851_0225_1007ABF9B6F0D990">
we are no le&s;s &s;o, in the la&s;t place, for tho&s;e which find admittance into our hearts from &s;upine negligence, from total relaxation of attention, from allowing our imagination to rove with entire licence, "like the eyes of the fool, towards the ends of the earth." Our minds are, in this ca&s;e, thrown open to folly and vanity. They are pro&s;tituted to every evil thing which plea&s;es to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The con&s;equences mu&s;t all be charged to our account; and in vain we plead excu&s;e from human infirmity. Hence it appears, that the great object at which we are to aim in governing our thoughts, is, to take the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures for preventing the introduction of &s;uch as are &s;inful, and for ha&s;tening their expul&s;ion, if they &s;hall have intro|duced them&s;elves without con&s;ent of the will.</P>
<P>But when we de&s;cend into our brea&s;ts, and examine how far we have &s;tudied to keep this object in view, who can tell, "how oft he hath offended?" In no article of religion or morals are men more culpably remi&s;s, than in the unre&s;trained indulgence they give to fancy; and that too, for the mo&s;t part without remor&s;e. Since the time that Rea&s;on began to exert her powers, Thought, during our waking hours, has been active in every brea&s;t, without a moment's &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or pau&s;e. The current of ideas has been always flowing. The wheels of the &s;piritual engine have circulated with perpetual motion. Let me a&s;k, what has been the fruit of this ince&s;&s;ant activity with the greater part of mankind? Of the innumerable hours that have been employed in thought, how few are marked with any permanent or u&s;eful effect? How many have either pa&s;&s;ed away in idle dreams; or have been abandoned to anxious di&s;contented mu&s;ings, to un&s;ocial and ma|lignant

<HEAD>SECTION VI. On the Evils which flow from unre&s;trained Pa&s;&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN man revolted from his Maker, his pa&s;&s;ions rebelled again&s;t him&s;elf; and, from being originally the mini&s;ters of rea&s;on, have become the tyrants of the &s;oul. Hence, in treating of this &s;ubject, two things may be a&s;&s;umed as principles: fir&s;t, that through the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">nt weakne&s;s of the under&s;tanding, our pa&s;&s;ions are often directed towards improper objects; and next, that even when their direction is ju&s;t, and their ob|jects are innocent, they perpetually tend to run into exce&s;s; they always hurry us towards their gratifica|tion, with a blind and dangerous impetuo&s;ity. On the&s;e, two points then turns the whole government of our pa&s;&s;ions: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to a&s;certain the proper objects of their pur&s;uit; and next, to re&s;train them in that pur|&s;uit, when they would carry us beyond the bounds of rea&s;on. If there be any pa&s;&s;ion which intrudes it&s;elf un&s;ea&s;onably into our mind, which darkens and trou|bles our judgment, or habitually di&s;compo&s;es our tem|per; which unfits us for properly di&s;charging the du|ties, or di&s;qualifies us for cheerfully enjoying the com|forts of life, we may certainly conclude it to have gained a dangerous a&s;cendant. The great object which we ought to propo&s;e to our&s;elves, is, to acquire a firm and &s;teadfa&s;t mind, which the infatuation of pa&s;|&s;ion &s;hall not &s;educe, nor its violence &s;hake; which, re&s;ting on fixed principles, &s;hall, in the mid&s;t of con|tending emotions, remain free, and ma&s;ter of it&s;elf;

able to li&s;ten calmly to the voice of con&s;cience, and prepared to obey its dictates without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>To obtain, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;uch command of pa&s;&s;ion, is one of the highe&s;t attainments of the rational nature. Arguments to &s;how its importance crowd upon us from every quarter. If there be any fertile &s;ource of mi&s;|chief to human life, it is, beyond doubt, the mi&s;rule of pa&s;&s;ion. It is this which poi&s;ons the enjoyment of individuals, overturns the order of &s;ociety, and &s;trews the path of life with &s;o many mi&s;eries, as to render it indeed the vale of tears. All tho&s;e great &s;cenes of public calamity, which we behold with a&s;toni&s;hment, and horror, have originated from the &s;ource of violent pa&s;&s;ions. The&s;e have over&s;pread the earth with blood|&s;hed. The&s;e have pointed the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in's dagger, and filled the poi&s;oned bowl. The&s;e, in every age, have furni&s;hed too copious materials for the orator's pathetic declamation, and for the poet's tragical &s;ong.</P>
<P>When from public life we de&s;cend to private con|duct, though pa&s;&s;ion operates not there in &s;uch a wide and de&s;tructive &s;phere, we &s;hall find its influence to be no le&s;s baneful. I need not mention the black and fierce pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as envy, jealou&s;y and revenge, who&s;e effects are obviou&s;ly noxious, and who&s;e agita|tions are immediate mi&s;ery.

Suppo&s;e it to have unlimited &s;cope; trace it throughout its cour&s;e; and we &s;hall find that gradually, as it ri&s;es, it taints the &s;oundne&s;s, and troubles the peace of his mind over whom it reigns; that, in its progre&s;s, it engages him in pur&s;uits which are marked either with danger or with &s;hame; that, in the end, it wa&s;tes his fortune, de&s;troys his health, or deba&s;es his character; and aggravates all the mi&s;eries

<HEAD>SECTION VII. On the proper State of our Temper, with re&s;pect to one another.</HEAD>
<P>IT is evident, in the general, that if we con&s;ult ei|ther public welfare or private happine&s;s, Chri&s;tian charity ought to regulate our di&s;po&s;ition in mutual in|tercour&s;e. But as this great principle admits of &s;everal diver&s;ified appearances, let us con&s;ider &s;ome of the chief forms under which it ought to &s;how it&s;elf in the u&s;ual tenour of life.</P>
<P>What, fir&s;t, pre&s;ents it&s;elf to be recommended, is a peaceable temper; a di&s;po&s;ition aver&s;e to give offence, and de&s;irous of cultivating harmony, and amicable in|tercour&s;e in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ciety. This &s;uppo&s;es yielding and con|de&s;cending manners, unwillingne&s;s to contend with others about trifles, and, in conte&s;ts that are unavoid|able, proper moderation of &s;pirit. Such a temper is the fir&s;t principle of &s;elf-enjoyment. It is the ba&s;is of all order and happine&s;s among mankind. The po&s;itive and contentious, the rude and quarrel&s;ome, are the bane of &s;ociety. They &s;eem de&s;tined to bla&s;t the &s;mall &s;hare of comfort which nature has here alloted to man. But they cannot di&s;turb the peace of others, more than they break their own. The hurricane rages fir&s;t in their own bo&s;om, before it is let forth upon the
<PB N="193" REF="035851_0230_1007AC079C7CE090">
world. In the tempe&s;ts which they rai&s;e, they are always to&s;t; and frequently it is their lot to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>A peaceable temper mu&s;t be &s;upported by a candid one, or a di&s;po&s;ition to view the conduct of others with fairne&s;s and impartiality. This &s;tands oppo&s;ed to a jealous and &s;u&s;picious temper, which a&s;cribes every action to the wor&s;t motive, and throws a black &s;hade over every character. If we would be happy in our&s;elves, or in our connexions with others, let us guard again&s;t this malignant &s;pirit. Let us &s;tudy that charity "which thinketh no evil;" that temper which, without degenerating into credulity, will di&s;po&s;e us to be ju&s;t; and which can allow us to ob&s;erve an error, without imputing it as a crime. Thus we &s;hall be kept free from that continual irritation, which imagi|nary injuries rai&s;e in a &s;u&s;picious brea&s;t; and &s;hall walk among men as our brethren, not as our enemies.</P>
<P>But to be peaceable, and to be candid, is not all that is required of a good man. He mu&s;t cultivate a kind, generous, and &s;ympathizing temper, which feels for di&s;tre&s;s, wherever it is beheld; which enters into the concerns of his friends with ardour; and to all with whom he has intercour&s;e, is gentle, obliging, and hu|mane. How amiable appears &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, when contra&s;ted with a malicious or envious temper, which wraps it&s;elf up in its own narrow intere&s;t, looks with an evil eye on the &s;ucce&s;s of others, and, with an un|natural &s;atisfaction, feeds on their di&s;appointments or mi&s;eries! How little does he know of the true happi|ne&s;s of life, who is a &s;tranger to that intercour&s;e of good offices and kind affections, which, by a plea&s;ing charm, attaches men to one another, and circulates joy from heart to heart!</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="035851_0231_1007AC09F78CBFB8">
We are not to imagine, that a benevolent temper finds no exerci&s;e, unle&s;s when opportunities offer of performing actions of high genero&s;ity, or of exten&s;ive utility. The&s;e may &s;eldom occur. The condition of the greater part of mankind, in a good mea&s;ure, pre|cludes them. But, in the ordinary round of human affairs, many occa&s;ions daily pre&s;ent them&s;elves of miti|gating the vexations which others &s;uffer; of &s;oothing their minds; of aiding their intere&s;t; of promoting their cheerfulne&s;s, or ea&s;e. Such occa&s;ions may relate to the &s;maller incidents of life. But let us remember, that of &s;mall incidents the &s;y&s;tem of human life is chiefly compo&s;ed. The attentions which re&s;pect the&s;e, when &s;ugge&s;ted by real benignity of temper, are often more material to the happine&s;s of tho&s;e around us, than actions which carry the appearance of greater dig|nity and &s;plendour. No wi&s;e or good man ought to account any rules of behaviour as below his regard, which tend to cement the great brotherhood of man|kind in comfortable union.</P>
<P>Particularly amid&s;t that familiar intercour&s;e which belongs to dome&s;tic life, all the virtues of temper find an ample range. It is very unfortunate, that within that circle, men too often think them&s;elves at liberty, to give unre&s;trained vent to the caprice of pa&s;&s;ion and humour. Whereas there, on the contrary, more than any where, it concerns them to attend to the government of their heart; to check what is violent in their tem|pers, and to &s;often what is har&s;h in their manners. For there the temper is formed. There, the real character di&s;plays it&s;elf. The forms of the world di&s;|gui&s;e men when abroad. But within his own family, every man is known to be what he truly is.&mdash;In all
<PB N="195" REF="035851_0232_1007AC0C59C47368">
our intercour&s;e then with others, particularly in that which is clo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t intimate, let us cultivate a peaceable, a candid, a gentle and friendly temper. This is the temper to which, by repeated injunctions, our holy religion &s;eeks to form us. This was the tem|per of Chri&s;t. This is the temper of Heaven.</P>

<P>IS IT bigotry to believe the &s;ublime truths of the go&s;pel, with full a&s;&s;urance of faith? I glory in &s;uch bigotry. I would not part with it for a thou&s;and worlds. I congratulate the man who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it: for, amid&s;t all the vici&s;&s;itudes and calamities of the pre&s;ent &s;tate, that man enjoys an inexhau&s;tible fund of con&s;olation, of which it is not in the power of fortune to deprive him.</P>
<P>There is not a book on earth, &s;o favourable &s;o all the kind, and all the &s;ublime affections; or &s;o un|friendly to hatred and per&s;ecution, to tyranny, in|ju&s;tice, and every &s;ort of malevolence, as the Go&s;pel. It breathes nothing throughout, but mercy, benevo|lence, and peace.</P>
<P>Poetry is &s;ublime, when it awakens in the mind any great and good affection, as piety, or patrioti&s;m. This is one of the noble&s;t effects of the heart. The P&s;alms are remarkable, beyond all other writings, for their power of in&s;piring devout emotions. But it is not in this re&s;pect only, that they are &s;ublime.

<P>OMAR, the &s;on of Hu&s;&s;an, had pa&s;&s;ed &s;eventy-five years, in honour and pro&s;perity. The favour of three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive califs had filled his hou&s;e with gold and &s;ilver; and whenever he appeared, the benedictions of the people proclaimed his pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Terre&s;trial happine&s;s is of &s;hort continuance. The brightne&s;s of the flame is wa&s;ting its fuel; the fragrant flower is pa&s;&s;ing away in its own odours.

<P>The powers of his mind were yet unimpaired. His chamber was filled by vi&s;itants, eager to catch the dictates of experience, and officious to pay the tribute of admiration.

If he commands not the&s;e advantages, yet all the com|forts, which he &s;ees in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the de&s;erving, become in &s;ome &s;ort his, by his rejoicing in the good which they enjoy. Even the face of nature yields a &s;atisfaction to him, which the in&s;en&s;ible can-never know. The profu&s;ion of goodne&s;s which he beholds poured forth on the univer&s;e, dilates his-heart with
<PB N="202" REF="035851_0239_1007AC2002B509F8">
the thought, that innumerable multitudes around him are ble&s;t and happy. When he &s;ees the labours of men appearing to pro&s;per, and views a country flouri&s;hing in wealth and indu&s;try; when he beholds the &s;pring coming forth in its beauty, and reviving the decayed face of nature; or in autumn beholds the fields loaded with plenty, and the year crowned with all its fruits; he lifts his affections with gratitude to the great Father of all, and rejoices in the general felicity and joy.</P>
<P>It may indeed be objected, that the &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility lays open the heart to be pierced with many wounds, from the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which abound in the world; ex|po&s;es us to frequent &s;uffering from the participation which it communicates of the &s;orrows, as well as of the joys, of friend&s;hip. But let it be con&s;idered, that the tender melancholy of &s;ympathy, is accompanied with a &s;en&s;ation, which they who feel it would not exchange for the gratifications of the &s;elfi&s;h. When the heart is &s;trongly moved by any of the kind affec|tions, even when it pours it&s;elf forth in virtuous &s;or|row, a &s;ecret attractive charm mingles with the pain|ful emotion; there is a joy in the mid&s;t of grief. Let it be farther con&s;idered, that the griefs which &s;en|&s;ibility introduces, are counterbalanced by plea&s;ures which flow from the &s;ame &s;ource. Sen&s;ibility height|ens in general the human powers, and is connected with acutene&s;s in all our feelings. If it makes us more alive to &s;ome painful &s;en&s;ations, in return, it renders the plea&s;ing ones more vivid and animated. The &s;elfi&s;h man langui&s;hes in his narrow circle of plea&s;ures. They are confined to what affects his own intere&s;t. He is obliged to repeat the &s;ame gratifi|cations,
<PB N="203" REF="035851_0240_1007AC22934FC960">
till they become in&s;ipid. But the man of virtuous &s;en&s;ibility moves in a wider &s;phere of felicity. His powers are much more frequently called forth into occupations of plea&s;ing activity. Numberle&s;s oc|ca&s;ions open to him of indulging his favourite ta&s;te, by conveying &s;atisfaction to others. Often it is in his power, in one way or other, to &s;ooth the afflicted heart; to carry &s;ome con&s;olation into the hou&s;e of woe. In the &s;cenes of ordinary life, in the dome&s;tic and &s;ocial intercour&s;es of men, the cordiality of his affections cheers and gladdens him. Every appear|ance, every de&s;cription of innocent happine&s;s, is en|joyed by him. Every native expre&s;&s;ion of kindne&s;s and affection among others, is felt by him, even though he be not the object of it. Among a circle of friends, enjoying one another, he is as happy as the happie&s;t. In a word, he lives in a different &s;ort of world from what the &s;elfi&s;h man inhabits. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a new &s;en&s;e, that enables him to behold objects which the &s;elfi&s;h cannot &s;ee. At the &s;ame time, his enjoyments are not of that kind which remain merely on the &s;ur|face of the mind. They penetrate the heart. They enlarge and elevate, they refine and ennoble it. To all the plea&s;ing emotions of affection, they add the dignified con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of virtue.&mdash;Children of men! men formed by nature to live and to feel as brethren! how long will ye continue to e&s;trange your&s;elves from one another by competitions and jealou&s;ies, when in cordial union ye might be &s;o much more ble&s;t? How long will ye &s;eek your happine&s;s in &s;elfi&s;h gratifi|cations alone, neglecting tho&s;e purer and better &s;ources of joy, which flow from the affections and the heart?</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XII. On the true Honour of Man.</HEAD>
<P>THE proper honour of man ari&s;es not from &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;plendid actions and abilities, which excite high admiration. Courage and prowe&s;s, military re|nown, &s;ignal victories and conque&s;ts, may render the name of a man famous, without rendering his cha|racter truly honourable. To many brave men, to many heroes renowned in &s;tory, we look up with wonder. Their exploits are recorded. Their prai&s;es are &s;ung. They &s;tand as on an eminence above the re&s;t of mankind. Their eminence, neverthele&s;s, may not be of that &s;ort, before which we bow with inward e&s;teem and re&s;pect. Something more is wanted for that purpo&s;e, than the conquering arm, and the in|trepid mind. The laurels of the warrior mu&s;t at all times be dyed in blood, and bedewed with the tears of the widow and the orphan. But if they have been &s;tained by rapine and inhumanity; if &s;ordid avarice has marked his character; or low and gro&s;s &s;en&s;uality has degraded his life; the great hero &s;inks into a little man. What at a di&s;tance, or on a &s;uperficial view, we admired, becomes mean, perhaps odious, when we examine it more clo&s;ely. It is like the Colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue, who&s;e immen&s;e &s;ize &s;truck the &s;pectator afar off with a&s;toni&s;hment; but when nearly viewed, it appears di&s;proportioned, un&s;hapely, and rude.</P>
<P>Ob&s;ervations of the &s;ame kind may be applied to all the reputation derived from civil accompli&s;hments; from the refined politics of the &s;tate&s;man; or the lite|rary

efforts of genius and erudition. The&s;e be&s;tow, and, within certain bounds, ought to be&s;tow, emi|nence and di&s;tinction on men. They di&s;cover talents which in them&s;elves are &s;hining; and which become highly valuable, when employed in advancing the good of mankind. Hence, they frequently give ri&s;e to &s;ame. But a di&s;tinction is to be made between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame and true honour. The &s;tate&s;man, the orator, or the poet, may be famous; while yet the man him|&s;elf is far from being honoured. We envy his abi|lities. We wi&s;h to rival them.

<P>From all this it follows, that, in order to di&s;cern where man's true honour lies, we mu&s;t look, not to any adventitious circum&s;tance of fortune; not to any &s;ingle &s;parkling quality; but to the whole of what forms a man; what entitles him, as &s;uch, to rank high among that cla&s;s of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ngs to which he belongs; in a word, we mu&s;t look to the mind and the &s;oul.&mdash;A mind &s;uperior to fear to &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;t and corrup|tion; a mind governed by the principles of uniform rectitude and integrity; the &s;ame in pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity; which no bribe can &s;educe, nor terror over|awe; neither by plea&s;ure melted into effeminacy, now by di&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;s &s;unk into dejection: &s;uch is the mind which forms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;tinction and eminence of man.&mdash;One, who, in no &s;itu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters"> of life, is either a&s;hamed or afraid of di&s;charging <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> duty, and acting his proper part with firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy; tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to the God whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he wor&s;hips, and tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to the faith in which he profe&s;&s;es to believe; full of affection to his brethren of man|kind;

<HEAD>SECTION XIII. The Influence of Devotion on the Happine&s;s of Life.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER promotes and &s;trengthens virtue, whatever calms and regulates the temper, is a &s;ource of happine&s;s. Devotion produces tho&s;e effects in a remarkable degree. It in&s;pires compo&s;ure of &s;pirit, mildne&s;s, and benignity; weakens the painful, and cheri&s;hes the plea&s;ing emotions; and, by the&s;e means, carries on the life of a pious man in a &s;mooth and placid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> exerting this habitual influence on the mind, devotion opens a field of enjoyments, to which the vicious are entire &s;trangers; enjoyments the more valuable, as they peculiarly belong to retirement, when the world leaves us; and to adver&s;ity, when it
<PB N="207" REF="035851_0244_100935F8851FD420">
becomes our foe. The&s;e are the two &s;ea&s;ons, for which every wi&s;e man would mo&s;t wi&s;h to provide &s;ome hidden &s;tore of comfort. For let him be placed in the mo&s;t favourable &s;ituation which the human &s;tate admits, the world can neither always amu&s;e him, nor always &s;hield him from di&s;tre&s;s. There will be many hours of vacuity, and many of dejection, in his life. If he be a &s;tranger to God, and to devotion, how dreary will the gloom of &s;olitude often prove! With what oppre&s;&s;ive weight will &s;ickne&s;s, di&s;appointment, or old age, fall upon his &s;pirits! But, for tho&s;e pen&s;ive periods, the pious man has a relief prepared. From the tire&s;ome repetition of the common vanities of life, or from the painful corro&s;ion of its cares and &s;or|rows, devotion tran&s;ports him into a new region; and &s;urrounds him there with &s;uch objects, as are the mo&s;t fitted to cheer the dejection, to calm the tumults, and to heal the wounds of his heart. If the world has been empty and delu&s;ive, it gladdens him with the pro&s;pect of a higher and better order of things, about to ari&s;e. If men have been ungrateful and ba&s;e, it di&s;plays before him the faithfulne&s;s of that Supreme Being, who, though every other friend fail, will never for&s;ake him. Let us con&s;ult our experience, and we &s;hall find, that the two greate&s;t &s;ources of inward joy, are, the exerci&s;e of love directed towards a de|&s;erving object, and the exerci&s;e of hope terminating on &s;ome high and a&s;&s;ured happine&s;s. Both the&s;e are &s;upplied by devotion; and therefore we have no rea&s;on to be &s;urpri&s;ed, if, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, it fills the hearts of good men with a &s;atisfaction not to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="035851_0245_100935F703306BE8">
The refined plea&s;ures of a pious mind are, in many re&s;pects, &s;uperior to the coar&s;e gratifications of &s;en&s;e. They are plea&s;ures which belong to the highe&s;t powers, and be&s;t affections of the &s;oul; whereas the gratifications of &s;en&s;e re&s;ide in the lowe&s;t region of our nature. To the latter, the &s;oul &s;toops below its na|tive dignity. The former, rai&s;e it above it&s;elf. The latter, leave always a comfortle&s;s, often a mortifying, remembrance behind them. The former, are reviewed wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h applau&s;e and delight. The plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e re&s;emble a foaming torrent, which, after a di&s;orderly cour&s;e, &s;peedily runs out, and leaves an empty and offen&s;ive channel. But the plea&s;ures of devotion re|&s;emble the equable current of a pure river, which enlivens the fields through which it pa&s;&s;es, and dif|fu&s;es verdure and fertility along its banks. To thee, O Devotion! we owe the highe&s;t improvement of our nature, and much of the enjoyment of our life. Thou art the &s;upport of our virtue, and the re&s;t of our &s;ouls, in this turbulent world. Thou compo&s;e&s;t the thoughts. Thou calme&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions. Thou exalte&s;t the heart. Thy communications, and thine only, are imparted to the low, no le&s;s than to the high; to the poor, as well as to the rich. In thy pre&s;ence, worldly di&s;tinc|tions cea&s;e; and under thy influence, worldly &s;orrows are forgotten. Thou art the balm of the wounded mind. Thy &s;anctuary is ever open to the mi&s;erable; inacce&s;&s;ible only to the unrighteous and impure. Thou beginne&s;t on earth, the temper of heaven. In thee, the ho&s;ts of angels and ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits eternally rejoice.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIV. The planetary and terre&s;trial Worlds comparatively con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>TO US, who dwell on its &s;urface, the earth is by far the mo&s;t exten&s;ive orb that our eyes can any where behold: It is al&s;o clothed with verdure, di&s;tingui&s;hed by trees, and adorned with a variety of beautiful de|corations; whereas, to a &s;pectator placed on one of the planets, it wears a uniform a&s;pect; looks all lu|minous; and no larger than a &s;pot. To beings who dwell at &s;till greater di&s;tances, it entirely di&s;appears. That which we call alternately the morning and the evening &s;tar, as in one part of the orbit &s;he rides foremo&s;t in the proce&s;&s;ion of night, in the other u&s;hers in and anticipates the dawn, is a planetary world, which, with the four others that &s;o wonderfully vary their my&s;tic dance, are in them&s;elves dark bodies, and &s;hine only by reflection; have fields, and &s;eas, and &s;kies of their own; are furni&s;hed with all accommo|dations for animal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the abodes of intellectual life; all which, together with our earthly habitation, are dependent on that grand di&s;pen&s;er of Divine munificence, the &s;un; receive their light from the di&s;tribution of his rays, and derive their comfort from his benign agency.</P>
<P>The &s;un, which &s;eems to perform its daily &s;tages through the &s;ky, is in this re&s;pect fixed and immovable: it is the great axle of heaven, about which the globe we inhabit, and other more &s;pacious orbs, wheel their &s;tated cour&s;es. The &s;un, though &s;eemingly &s;maller

than the dial it illuminates, is abundantly larger than this whole earth, on which &s;o many lofty mountains ri&s;e, and &s;uch va&s;t oceans roll. A line extending from &s;ide to &s;ide through the centre of that re&s;plendent orb, would mea&s;ure more than eight hundred thou&s;and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iles: a girdle formed to go round its circumference, would require a length of millions. Were its &s;olid con|tents to be e&s;timated, the account would overwhelm our under&s;tanding, and be almo&s;t beyond the power of language to expre&s;s. Are we &s;tartled at the&s;e re|ports of philo&s;ophy? Are we ready to cry out in a tran&s;port of &s;urpri&s;e, "How mighty is the Being who kindled &s;uch a prodigious fire; and keeps alive, from age to age, &s;uch an enormous ma&s;s of flame!" let us attend our philo&s;ophic guides, and we &s;hall be brought acquainted with &s;peculations more enlarged and more inflaming.</P>
<P>This &s;un, with all its attendant planets, is but a very little part of the grand machine of the univer&s;e; every &s;tar, though in appearance no bigger than the diamond that glitters upon a lady's ring, is really a va&s;t globe, like the &s;un in &s;ize and in glory; no le&s;s &s;pacious, no le&s;s luminous, than the radiant &s;ource of day. So that every &s;tar, is not barely a world, but the centre of a magnificent &s;y&s;tem; has a retinue of worlds, irradiated by its beams, and revolving round its attractive influ|ence, all which are lo&s;t to our &s;ight in unmea&s;urable wilds of ether. That the &s;tars appear like &s;o many diminutive and &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;hable points, is owing to their immen&s;e and inconceivable di&s;tance. Immen&s;e and inconceivable indeed it is, &s;ince a ball, &s;hot from the loaded cannon, and flying with unabated rapidity, mu&s;t travel, at this impetuous rate, almo&s;t

&s;even hundred thou&s;and years, before it could reach the neare&s;t of the&s;e twinkling luminaries.</P>
<P>While, beholding this va&s;t expan&s;e, I learn my own extreme meanne&s;s, I would al&s;o di&s;cover the abject littlene&s;s of all terre&s;trial things. What is the earth, with all her o&s;tentatious &s;cenes, compared with this a&s;toni&s;hing grand furniture of the &s;kies? What, but a dim &s;peck, hardly perceivable in the map of the univer&s;e? It is ob&s;erved by a very judicious writer, that if the &s;un him&s;elf, which enlightens this part of the creation, were extingui&s;hed, and all the ho&s;t of planetary worlds, which move about him, were anni|hilated, they would not be mi&s;&s;ed by an eye that can take in the whole compa&s;s of nature, any more than a grain of &s;and upon the &s;ea-&s;hore. The bulk of which they con&s;i&s;t, and the &s;pace which they occupy, are &s;o exceedingly little in compari&s;on of the whole, that their lo&s;s would &s;carcely leave a blank in the immen&s;ity of God's works. If then, not our globe only, but this whole &s;y&s;tem, be &s;o very diminutive, what is a king|dom or a county? What are a few lord&s;hips, or the &s;o much admired patrimonies of tho&s;e who are &s;tyled wealthy? When I mea&s;ure them with my own little pittance, they &s;well into proud and bloated dimen|&s;ions: but when I take the univer&s;e for my &s;tandard, how &s;canty is their &s;ize, how contemptible their figure!

<HEAD>SECTION XV. On the Power of Cu&s;tom, and the U&s;es to which it may be applied.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not a common &s;aying, which has a better turn of &s;en&s;e in it, than what we often hear in the mouths of the vulgar, that 'Cu&s;tom is a &s;econd nature.' It is indeed able to form the man anew; and give him inclinations and capacities altogether different from tho&s;e he was born with. A per&s;on who is addicted to play or gaming, though he took but little delight in it at fir&s;t, by degrees contracts &s;o &s;trong an inclination towards it, and gives him&s;elf up &s;o entirely to it, that it &s;eems the only end of his being. The love of a retired or bu&s;y life will grow upon a man in&s;en&s;ibly, as he is conver&s;ant in the one or the other, till he is utterly unqualified for reli&s;hing that to which he has been for &s;ome time di&s;u&s;ed. Nay, a man may &s;moke, or drink, or take &s;nuff, till he is unable to pa&s;s away his time without it; not to mention how our delight in any particular &s;tudy, art, or &s;cience, ri&s;es and improves, in proportion to the application which we be&s;tow upon it. Thus, what was at fir&s;t an exerci&s;e, becomes at length an entertainment. Our employments are changed into diver&s;ions. The mind grows fond of tho&s;e actions it is accu&s;tomed to; and is drawn with reluctancy from tho&s;e paths in which it has been u&s;ed to walk.</P>
<P>If we attentively con&s;ider this property of human nature, it may in&s;truct us in very fine moralities. In the fir&s;t place, I would have no man di&s;couraged with
<PB N="213" REF="035851_0250_1007AC38A16D57B0">
that kind of life, or &s;eries of action, in which the choice of others, or his own nece&s;&s;ities, may have engaged him. It may perhaps be very di&s;agreeable to him, at fir&s;t; but u&s;e and application will certainly render it not only le&s;s painful, but plea&s;ing and &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, I would recommend to every one, the admirable precept, which Pythagoras is &s;aid to have given to his di&s;ciples, and which that philo&s;opher mu&s;t have drawn from the ob&s;ervation I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">larg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d upon: "Pitch upon that cour&s;e of life which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mo&s;t excellent, and cu&s;tom will render it the mo&s;t de|lightful." Men, who&s;e circum&s;tances will permit them to choo&s;e their own way of life, are inexcu&s;able if they do not pur&s;ue that which their judgment tells them is the mo&s;t laudable. The voice of rea&s;on is more to be regarded, than the bent of any pre&s;ent inclination; &s;ince, by the rule above mentioned, in|clination will at length come over to rea&s;on, though we can never force rea&s;on to comply with inclina|tion.</P>
<P>In the third place, this ob&s;ervation may teach the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ual and irreligious man, to overlook tho&s;e hard|&s;hips and difficulties, which are apt to di&s;courage him from the pro&s;ecution of a virtuous life. "The Gods," &s;aid He&s;iod, "have placed labour before virtue; the way to her is at fir&s;t rough and difficult, but grows more &s;mooth and ea&s;y the farther we advance in it." The man who proceeds in it with &s;teadine&s;s and re&s;olution, will in a little time, find that "her ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and that all her paths are peace."</P>
<P>To enforce this con&s;ideration, we may further ob|&s;erve, that the practice of religion will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> only be
<PB N="214" REF="035851_0251_1007AC3B4FC840B0">
attended with that plea&s;ure, which naturally accompa|nies tho&s;e actions to which we are habituated, but with tho&s;e &s;upernumerary joys of heart, that ri&s;e from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch a plea&s;ure; from the &s;atisfaction of acting up to the dictates of rea&s;on; and from the pro&s;pect of a happy immortality.</P>
<P>In the fourth place, we may learn from this ob&s;erva|tion, which we have made on the mind of man, to take particular care, when we are once &s;ettled in a regular cour&s;e of life, how we too frequently indulge our&s;elves in even the mo&s;t innocent diver&s;ions and entertainments; &s;ince the mind may in&s;en&s;ibly fall off from the reli&s;h of virtuous actions, and, by degrees, exchange that plea|&s;ure&punc; which it takes in the performance of its duty for delights of a much inferior and an unprofitable nature.</P>
<P>The la&s;t u&s;e which I &s;hall make of this remarkable property in human nature, of being delighted with tho&s;e actions to which it is accu&s;tomed, is, to &s;how how ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary it is for us to gain habits of virtue in this life, if we would enjoy the plea&s;ures of the next. The &s;tate of bli&s;s, we call Heaven, will not be capable of affecting tho&s;e minds which are not thus qualified for it: we mu&s;t in this world, gain a reli&s;h of truth and virtue, if we would be able to ta&s;te that knowledge and perfection, which are to make us happy in the next. The &s;eeds of tho&s;e &s;piritual joys and raptures, which are to ri&s;e up and flouri&s;h in the &s;oul to all eternity, mu&s;t be planted in it during this its pre&s;ent &s;tate of probation. In &s;hort, heaven is not to be looked upon only as the reward, but as the na|tural effect, of a religious life.</P>

<P>TRUE candour is altogether different from that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">arded, inoffen&s;ive language, and that &s;tudied open|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s of behaviour, which we &s;o frequently meet with among men of the world. Smiling, very often, is the a&s;pect, and &s;mooth are the words, of tho&s;e who in|wardly are the mo&s;t ready to think evil of others. That candour which is a Chri&s;tian virtue, con&s;i&s;ts, not in fairne&s;s of &s;peech, but in fairne&s;s of heart. It may want the blandi&s;hment of external courte&s;y, but &s;upplies its place with humane and generous li|berality of &s;entiment. Its manners are unaffected, and its profe&s;&s;ions cordial. Exempt, on one hand, from the dark jealou&s;y of a &s;u&s;picious mind, it is no le&s;s removed, on the other, from that ea&s;y credulity which is im|po&s;ed on by every &s;pecious pretence. It is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with exten&s;ive knowledge of the world, and with due attention to our own &s;afety. In that various intercour&s;e, which we are obliged to carry on with per&s;ons of every different character, &s;u&s;picion, to a certain degree, is a nece&s;&s;ary guard. It is only when it exceeds the bounds of prudent caution, that it de|generates into vice. There is a proper mean between undi&s;tingui&s;hing credulity, and univer&s;al jealou&s;y, which a &s;ound under&s;tanding di&s;cerns, and which the man of candour &s;tudies to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>He makes allowance for the mixture of evil with good, which is to be found in every human character. He expects none to be faultle&s;s; and he is unwilling
<PB N="217" REF="035851_0254_1007AC446BBCB378">
to believe that there is any without &s;ome commendable quality. In the mid&s;t of many defects, he can di&s;cover a virtue. Under the influence of per&s;onal re&s;entment, he can be ju&s;t to the merit of an enemy. He never lends an open car to tho&s;e defamatory reports and dark &s;ugge&s;tions, which, among the tribes of the cen|&s;orious, circulate with &s;o much rapidity, and meet with &s;uch ready acceptance. He is not ha&s;ty to judge, and he requires full evidence before he will condemn. As long as an action can be a&s;cribed to different mo|tives, he holds it as no mark of &s;agacity to impute it always to the wor&s;t. Where there is ju&s;t ground for doubt, he keeps his judgment undecided; and, dur|ing the period of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, leans to the mo&s;t charitable con&s;truction which an action can bear. When he mu&s;t condemn, he condemns with regret; and without tho&s;e aggravations which the &s;everity of others adds to the crime. He li&s;tens calmly to the apology of the offend|er, and readily admits every extenuating circum&s;tance which equity can &s;ugge&s;t. How much &s;oever he may blame the principles of any &s;ect or party, he never confounds, under one general cen&s;ure, all who belong to that party or &s;ect. He charges them not with &s;uch con&s;equences of their tenets, as they refu&s;e and di&s;|avow. From one wrong opinion, he does not infer the &s;ubver&s;ion of all &s;ound principles; nor from one bad action, conclude that all regard to con&s;cience is over|thrown. When he "beholds the mote in his brother's eye," he remembers "the beam in his own." He commi&s;erates human frailty; and judges of others according to the principles, by which he would think it rea&s;onable that they &s;hould judge of him.

<HEAD>SECTION XVIII. On the Imperfection of that Happine&s;s which re&s;ts &s;olely on worldly Plea&s;ures.</HEAD>
<P>THE vanity of human plea&s;ures is a topic which might be embelli&s;hed with the pomp of much de&s;crip|tion. But I &s;hall &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid exaggeration, and only point out a threefold vanity in human life, which every impartial ob&s;erver cannot but admit; di&s;ap|pointment in pur&s;uit, di&s;&s;atisfaction in enjoyment, un|certainty in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, di&s;appointment in pur&s;uit. When we look around us on the world, we every where behold a bu&s;y multitude, intent on the pro&s;ecution of various de&s;igns, which their wants or de&s;ires have &s;ugge&s;ted. We behold them employing every method which in|genuity can devi&s;e; &s;ome the patience of indu&s;try, &s;ome the boldne&s;s of enterprize, others the dexterity of &s;tratagem, in order to compa&s;s their ends. Of this ince&s;&s;ant &s;tir and activity, what is the fruit? In com|pari&s;on of the crowd who have toiled in vain, how &s;mall is the number of the &s;ucce&s;sful? Or rather, where is the man who will declare, that in every point <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> has completed his plan, and attained his utmo&s;t wi&s;h? No extent of human abilities has been able to di&s;cover a path which, in any line of life, leads unerringly to &s;ucce&s;s. "The race is not always to the &s;wift, nor the
<PB N="219" REF="035851_0256_1007924FF38B9A38">
battle to the &s;trong, nor riches to men of under&s;tand|ing." We may form our plans with the mo&s;t profound &s;agacity, and with the mo&s;t vigilant caution may guard again&s;t dangers on every &s;ide. But &s;ome unfore&s;een occurrence comes acro&s;s, which baffles our wi&s;dom, and lays our labours in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>Were &s;uch di&s;appointments confined to tho&s;e who a&s;pire at engro&s;&s;ing the higher departments of life, the misfortune would be le&s;s. The humiliation of the mighty, and the fall of ambition from its towering height, little concern the bulk of mankind. The&s;e are objects on which, as on di&s;tant meteors, they gaze from afar, without drawing per&s;onal in&s;truction from events &s;o much above them. But, alas! when we de&s;cend into the regions of private life, we find di&s;appointment and bla&s;ted hope equally prevalent there. Neither the moderation of our views, nor the ju&s;tice of our preten&s;ions, can en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. But "time and chance happen to all." Again&s;t the &s;tream of events, both the worthy and the unde&s;erving are obliged to &s;truggle; and both are frequently overborne alike by the current.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides di&s;appointment in pur&s;uit, di&s;&s;atisfaction in enjoyment is a farther vanity, to which the human &s;tate is &s;ubject. This is the &s;evere&s;t of all mortifications, after having been &s;ucce&s;sful in the pur&s;uit, to be baffled in the enjoyment it&s;elf. Yet this is found to be an evil &s;till more general than the former. Some may be &s;o fortunate as to attain what they have pur|&s;ued; but none are rendered completely happy by what they have attained. Di&s;appointed hope is mi|&s;ery; and yet &s;ucce&s;sful hope is only imperfect bli&s;s. Look through all the ranks of mankind. Examine the
<PB N="220" REF="035851_0257_100792544277BE90">
condition of tho&s;e who appear mo&s;t pro&s;perous; and you will find that they are never ju&s;t what they de&s;ire to be. If retired, they langui&s;h for action; if bu&s;y, they complain of fatigue. If in middle life, they are impatient for di&s;tinction; if in high &s;tations, they &s;igh after freedom and ea&s;e. Something is &s;till wanting to that plenitude of &s;atisfaction, which they expected to acquire. Together with every wi&s;h that is gratified, a new demand ari&s;es. One void opens in the heart, as another is filled. On wi&s;hes, wi&s;hes grow; and to the end, it is rather the expectation of what they have not, than the enjoyment of what they have, which occupies and intere&s;ts the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>This di&s;&s;atisfaction in the mid&s;t of human plea&s;ure, &s;prings partly from the nature of our enjoyments them|&s;elves, and partly from circum&s;tances which corrupt them. No worldly enjoyments are adequate to the high de&s;ires and powers of an immortal &s;pirit. Fancy paints them at a di&s;tance with &s;plendid colours; but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion unveils the fallacy. The eagerne&s;s of pa&s;|&s;ion be&s;tows upon them, at fir&s;t, a bri&s;k and lively reli&s;h. But it is their fate always to pall by familiarity, and &s;ometimes to pa&s;s from &s;atiety into di&s;gu&s;t. Happy would the poor man think him&s;elf, if he could enter on all the trea&s;ures of the rich; and happy for a &s;hort time he might be: but before he had long contem|plated and admired his &s;tate, his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions would &s;eem to le&s;&s;en, and his cares would grow.</P>
<P>Add to the un&s;atisfying nature of our plea&s;ures, the attending circum&s;tances which never fail to corrupt them. For, &s;uch as they are, they are at no time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed unmixed. To human lips it is not given to ta&s;te the cup of pure joy. When external circum|&s;tances
<PB N="221" REF="035851_0258_10079255CC0F4BA8">
&s;how faire&s;t to the world, the envied man groans in private under his own burden. Some vexa|tion di&s;quiets, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion corrodes him; &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s, either felt or feared, gnaws, like a worm, the root of his felicity. When there is nothing from without to di&s;turb the pro&s;perous, a &s;ecret poi&s;on operates within. For worldly happine&s;s ever tends to de&s;troy it&s;elf, by corrupting the heart. It fo&s;ters the loo&s;e and the violent pa&s;&s;ions. It engenders noxious habits; and taints the mind with fal&s;e delicacy, which makes it feel a thou&s;and unreal evils.</P>
<P>But put the ca&s;e in the mo&s;t favourable light. Lay a&s;ide from human plea&s;ures both di&s;appointment in pur&s;uit, and deceitfulne&s;s in enjoyment; &s;uppo&s;e them to be fully attainable, and completely &s;atisfactory; &s;till there remains to be con&s;idered the vanity of un|certain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and &s;hort duration. Were there in worldly things any fixed point of &s;ecurity which we could gain, the mind would then have &s;ome ba&s;is on which to re&s;t. But our condition is &s;uch, that every thing wavers and totters around us. "Boa&s;t not thy|&s;elf of to-morrow; for thou knowe&s;t not what a day may bring forth." It is much if, during its cour&s;e, thou heare&s;t not of &s;omewhat to di&s;quiet or alarm thee. For life never proceeds long in a uniform train. It is continually varied by unexpected events. The &s;eeds of alteration are every where &s;own; and the &s;un&s;hine of pro&s;perity commonly accelerates their growth. If our enjoyments be numerous, we lie more open on different &s;ides to be wounded. If we have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them long, we have greater cau&s;e to dread an approaching change. By &s;low degrees pro|&s;perity
<PB N="222" REF="035851_0259_1007AB5B27A3E360">
ri&s;es; but rapid is the progre&s;s of evil. It re|quires no preparation to bring it forward. The edi|fice which it co&s;t much time and labour to erect, one inau&s;picious event, one &s;udden blow, can level with the du&s;t. Even &s;uppo&s;ing the accidents of life to leave us untouched, human bli&s;s mu&s;t &s;till be tran&s;i|tory; for man changes of him&s;elf. No cour&s;e of en|joyment can delight us long. What amu&s;ed our youth, lo&s;es its charm in maturer age. As years advance, our powers are blunted, and our plea&s;urable feelings decline. The &s;ilent lap&s;e of time is ever carrying &s;omewhat from us, till at length the period comes, when all mu&s;t be &s;wept away. The pro&s;pect of this termination of our labours and pur&s;uits, is &s;ufficient to mark our &s;tate with vanity. "Our days are a hand-breadth, and our age is as nothing." Within that little &s;pace is all our enterpri&s;e bounded. We crowd it with toils and cares, with contention and &s;trife. We project great de&s;igns, entertain high hopes, and then leave our plans unfini&s;hed, and &s;ink into ob|livion.</P>
<P>This much let it &s;uffice to have &s;aid concerning the vanity of the world. That too much has not been &s;aid, mu&s;t appear to every one who con&s;iders how generally mankind lean to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide; and how often, by undue attachment to the pre&s;ent &s;tate, they both feed the mo&s;t &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions, and "pierce them|&s;elves through with many &s;orrows."</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIX. What are the real and &s;olid Enjoyments of Human Life.</HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t be admitted, that unmixed and complete happine&s;s is unknown on earth. No regulation of conduct can altogether prevent pa&s;&s;ions from di&s;turb|ing our peace, and misfortunes from wounding our heart. But after this conce&s;&s;ion is made, will it fol|low, that there is no object on earth which de&s;erves our pur&s;uit, or that all enjoyment becomes contemptible which is not perfect? Let us &s;urvey our &s;tate with an impartial eye, and be ju&s;t to the various gifts of Hea|ven. How vain &s;oever this life, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, may be, the comforts and hopes of religion are &s;uf|ficient to give &s;olidity to the enjoyments of the righ|teous. In the exerci&s;e of good affections, and the te&s;timony of an approving con&s;cience; in the &s;en&s;e of peace and reconciliation with God, through the great Redeemer of mankind; in the firm confidence of be|ing conducted through all the trials of life, by infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s; and in the joyful pro&s;pect of arriving, in the end, at immortal felicity, they po&s;&s;e&s;s a happine&s;s which, de&s;cending from a purer and more perfect region than this world, partakes not of its vanity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the enjoyments peculiar to religion, there are other plea&s;ures of our pre&s;ent &s;tate, which, though of an inferior order, mu&s;t not be overlooked in the e&s;timate of human life. It is nece&s;&s;ary to call atten|tion to the&s;e, in order to check that repining and un|thankful
<PB N="224" REF="035851_0261_1007AB6035362588">
&s;pirit to which man is always too prone. Some degree of importance mu&s;t be allowed to the comforts of health, to the innocent gratifications of &s;en&s;e, and to the entertainment afforded us by all the beautiful &s;cenes of nature; &s;ome to the pur&s;uits and harmle&s;s amu&s;ements of &s;ocial life; and more to the internal enjoyments of thought and reflection, and to the plea&s;ures of affectionate intercour&s;e with tho&s;e whom we love. The&s;e comforts are often held in too low e&s;timation, merely becau&s;e they are ordinary and common; although that is the circum&s;tance which ought, in rea&s;on, to enhance their value. They lie open, in &s;ome degree, to all; extend through every rank of life, and fill up agreeably many of tho&s;e &s;paces in our pre&s;ent exi&s;tence, which are not occupied with higher objects, or with &s;erious cares.</P>
<P>From this repre&s;entation it appears that, notwith|&s;tanding the vanity of the world, a con&s;iderable de|gree of comfort is attainable in the pre&s;ent &s;tate. Let the recollection of this &s;erve to reconcile us to our condition, and to repre&s;s the arrogance of com|plaints and murmurs.&mdash;What art thou, O &s;on of man! who having &s;prung but ye&s;terday out of the du&s;t, dare&s;t to lift up thy voice again&s;t thy Maker, and to arraign his providence, becau&s;e all things are not or|dered according to thy wi&s;h? What title ha&s;t thou to find fault with the order of the univer&s;e, who&s;e lot is &s;o much beyond what thy virtue or merit gave thee ground to claim? Is it nothing to thee to have been introduced into this magnificent world; to have been admitted as a &s;pectator of the Divine wi&s;dom and works; and to have had acce&s;s to all the comforts which nature, with a bountiful hand, has poured

forth around thee? Are all the hours forgotten which thou ha&s;t pa&s;&s;ed in ea&s;e, in complacency, or joy? Is it a &s;mall favour in thy eyes, that the hand of Divine Mercy has been &s;tretched forth to aid thee, and, if thou reject not its proffered a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nduct thee into a happier &s;tate of exi&s;tence?

<P>THOUGH there is a great deal of plea&s;ure in con|templating the material world; by which I mean, that &s;y&s;tem of bodies, into which nature has &s;o curiou&s;ly wrought the ma&s;s of dead matter, with the &s;everal relations that tho&s;e bodies bear to one another; there is &s;till, methinks, &s;omething more wonderful and &s;ur|pri&s;ing, in contemplations on the world of life; by which I under&s;tand, all tho&s;e animals with which every part of the univer&s;e is furni&s;hed. The material world is only the &s;hell of the univer&s;e: the world of life are its inhabitants.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider tho&s;e parts of the material world, which lie the neare&s;t to us, and are therefore &s;ubject
<PB N="226" REF="035851_0263_1007AB65030ADAB8">
to our ob&s;ervations and inquiries, it is amazing to con&s;ider the infinity of animals with which it is &s;tocked. Every part of matter is peopled: every green leaf &s;warms with inhabitants. There is &s;carcely a &s;ingle humour in the body of a man, or of any other animal, in which our gla&s;&s;es do not di&s;cover myriads of living creatures. We find, even in the mo&s;t &s;olid bodies, as in marble it&s;elf, innumerable cells and ca|vities, which are crowded with &s;uch imperceptible in|habitants, as are too little for the naked eye to di&s;|cover. On the other hand, if we look into the more bulky parts of nature, we &s;ee the &s;eas, lakes, and rivers teeming with numberle&s;s kinds of living crea|tures. We find every mountain and mar&s;h, wilder|ne&s;s and wood, plentifully &s;tocked with birds and bea&s;ts; and every part of matter affording proper nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences, for the livelihood of multitudes which inhabit it.</P>
<P>The author of "the Plurality of Worlds," draws a very good argument from this con&s;ideration, for the peopling of every planet; as indeed it &s;eems very probable, from the analogy of rea&s;on, that if no part of matter, with which we are acquainted, lies wa&s;te and u&s;ele&s;s, tho&s;e great bodies, which are at &s;uch a di&s;tance from us are not de&s;ert and unpeopled; but rather, that they are furni&s;hed with beings adapted to their re&s;pective &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Exi&s;tence is a ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e beings only which are endowed with perception; and is in a manner thrown away upon dead matter, any farther than as it is &s;ub&s;ervient to beings which are con&s;cious of their exi&s;tence. Accordingly we find, from the bodies which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> under our ob&s;ervation, that matter is only
<PB N="227" REF="035851_0264_1007AB668A9A1C80">
made as the ba&s;is and &s;upport of animals; and that there is no more of the one than what is nece&s;&s;ary for the exi&s;tence of the other.</P>
<P>Infinite Goodne&s;s is of &s;o communicative a nature, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eems to delight in conferring exi&s;tence upon every degree of perceptive being. As this is a &s;pe|culation, which I have often pur&s;ued with great plea|&s;ure to my&s;elf, I &s;hall enlarge farther upon it, by con|&s;idering that part of the &s;cale of beings, which comes within our knowledge.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome living creatures, which are rai&s;ed but ju&s;t above dead matter. To mention only that &s;pecies of &s;hell-fi&s;h, which is formed in the fa&s;hion of a cone; that grows to the &s;urface of &s;everal rocks; and immediately dies, on being &s;evered from the place where it grew. There are many other crea|tures but one remove from the&s;e, which have no other &s;en&s;e than that of feeling and ta&s;te. Others have &s;till an additional one of hearing; others, of &s;mell; and others of &s;ight. It is wonderful to ob&s;erve, by what a gradual progre&s;s the world of life advances, through a prodigious variety of &s;pecies, before a creature is formed, that is complete in all its &s;en&s;es: and even among the&s;e, there is &s;uch a different degree of per|fection, in the &s;en&s;e which one animal enjoys beyond what appears in another, that though the &s;en&s;e in different animals is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame com|mon denomination, it &s;eems almo&s;t of a different na|ture. If, after this, we look into the &s;everal inward per|fections, of cunning and &s;agacity, or what we generally call in&s;tinct, we find them ri&s;ing, after the &s;ame man|ner, imperceptibly one above another; and receiving additional improvements, according to the &s;pecies in
<PB N="228" REF="035851_0265_1007AB68F25E0330">
which they are implanted. This progre&s;s in nature is &s;o very gradual, that the mo&s;t perfect of an inferior &s;pecies, comes very near to the mo&s;t imperfect of that which is immediately above it.</P>
<P>The exuberant and overflowing goodne&s;s of the Supreme Being, who&s;e mercy extends to all his works, is plainly &s;een, as I have before hinted, in his having made &s;o very little matter, at lea&s;t what falls within our knowledge, that does not &s;warm with life. Nor is his goodne&s;s le&s;s &s;een in the diver&s;ity, than in the multitude of living creatures. Had he made but one &s;pecies of animals, none of the re&s;t would have en|joyed the happine&s;s of exi&s;tence: he has therefore, <HI>&s;pecified,</HI> in his creation, every degree of life, every capacity of being. The whole cha&s;m of nature, from a plant to a man, is filled up with diver&s;e kinds of creatures, ri&s;ing one after another, by &s;uch a gentle and ea&s;y a&s;cent, that the little tran&s;itions and devi|ations from one &s;pecies to another, are almo&s;t in&s;en|&s;ible. This intermediate &s;pace is &s;o well hu&s;banded and managed, that there is &s;carcely a degree of per|ception, which does not appear in &s;ome one part of the world of life. Is the goodne&s;s, or the wi&s;dom of the Divine Being, more manife&s;ted in this his pro|ceeding?</P>
<P>There is a con&s;equence, be&s;ides tho&s;e I have already mentioned, which &s;eems very naturally de|ducible from the foregoing con&s;iderations. If the &s;cale of being ri&s;es, by &s;uch a regular progre&s;s, &s;o high as man, we may, by parity of rea&s;on, &s;uppo&s;e, that it &s;till proceeds gradually through tho&s;e beings which are of a &s;uperior nature to him; &s;ince there is in|finitely greater &s;pace and room for different degrees
<PB N="229" REF="035851_0266_1007AB6C825E79D0">
of perfection, between the Supreme Being and man, than between man and the mo&s;t de&s;picable infect.</P>
<P>In this great &s;y&s;tem of being, there is no creature &s;o wonderful in its nature, and which &s;o much de|&s;erves our particular attention, as man; who fills up the middle &s;pace between the animal and the intel|lectual nature, the vi&s;ible and the invi&s;ible world; and who is that link in the chain of beings, which forms the connection between both. So that he who, in one re&s;pect, is a&s;&s;ociated with angels and arch|angels, and may look upon a being of infinite per|fection as his father, and the highe&s;t order of &s;pirits as his brethren, may in another re&s;pect, &s;ay, to "corruption, thou art my father, and to the worm, thou art my mother and my &s;i&s;ter."</P>

<P>MAN, con&s;idered in him&s;elf, is a very helple&s;s, and a very wretched being. He is &s;ubject every moment to the greate&s;t calamities and misfortunes. He is be&s;et with dangers on all &s;ides; and may become unhappy by numberle&s;s ca&s;ualties, which he could not fore&s;ee, nor have prevented had he fore&s;een them.</P>
<P>It is our comfort, while we are obnoxious to &s;o many accidents, that we are under the care of ONE who directs contingencies, and has in his hands the management of every thing that is capable of annoying or offending us; who knows the a&s;&s;i&s;tance we &s;tand in
<PB N="230" REF="035851_0267_1007AB6ED86A2EE0">
need of, and is always ready to be&s;tow it on tho&s;e who a&s;k it of him.</P>
<P>The natural homage, which &s;uch a creature bears to &s;o infinitely wi&s;e and good a Being, is a firm reliance on him for the ble&s;&s;ings and conveniences of life; and an habitual tru&s;t in him, for deliverance out of all &s;uch dangers and difficulties as may befal us.</P>
<P>The man who always lives in this di&s;po&s;ition of mind, has not the &s;ame dark and melancholy views of human nature, as he who con&s;iders him&s;elf ab&s;tractedly from this relation to the Supreme Being. At the &s;ame time that he reflects upon his own weakne&s;s and imperfection, he comforts him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ith the contem|plation of tho&s;e divine attributes, which are em|ployed for his &s;afety, and his welfare. He finds his want of fore&s;ight made up, by the omni&s;cience of him who is his &s;upport. He is not &s;en&s;ible of his own want of &s;trength, when he knows that his helper is almighty. In &s;hort, the per&s;on who has a firm tru&s;t on the Supreme Being, is powerful in his power, wi&s;e by his wi&s;dom, happy by his happine&s;s. He reaps the benefit of every divine attribute; and lo&s;es his own in&s;ufficiency in the fulne&s;s of infinite perfection.</P>
<P>To make our lives more ea&s;y to us, we are com|manded to put our tru&s;t in him, who is thus able to relieve and &s;uccour us; the Divine goodne&s;s having made &s;uch a reliance a duty, notwith&s;tanding we &s;hould have been mi&s;erable, had it been forbidden us.</P>
<P>Among &s;everal motives, which might be made u&s;e of to recommend this duty to us, I &s;hall only take notice of tho&s;e that follow.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t is, that we are promi&s;ed, He will not fail tho&s;e who put their tru&s;t in him.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="035851_0268_1007AB7060DBB288">
But without con&s;idering the &s;upernatural ble&s;&s;ing, which accompanies this duty, we may ob&s;erve, that it has a natural tendency to its own reward; or, in other words, that this firm tru&s;t and confidence in the great Di&s;po&s;er of all things, contributes very much to the getting clear of any affliction, or to the bearing of it manfully. A per&s;on who believes he has his &s;uccour at hand, and that he acts in the &s;ight of his friend, often exerts him&s;elf beyond his abilities; and does wonders, that are not to be matched by one who is not animated with &s;uch a confidence of &s;ucce&s;s. Tru&s;t in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an Almighty Being, naturally pro|duces patience, hope, cheerfulne&s;s, and all other di&s;|po&s;itions of mind, which alleviate tho&s;e calamities that we are not able to remove.</P>
<P>The practice of this virtue admini&s;ters great com|fort to the mind of man, in times of poverty and affliction: but mo&s;t of all, in the hour of death. When the &s;oul is hovering, in the la&s;t moments of its &s;eparation; when it is ju&s;t entering on another &s;tate of exi&s;tence, to conver&s;e with &s;cenes, and objects, and companions, that are altogether new; what can &s;upport her under &s;uch tremblings of thought, &s;uch fear, &s;uch anxiety, &s;uch apprehen&s;ions, but the ca&s;ting of all her cares upon HIM, who fir&s;t gave her being; who has conducted her through one &s;tage of it; and who will be always pre&s;ent, to guide and com|fort her in her progre&s;s through eternity?</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXII. Piety and Gratitude enliven Pro&s;perity.</HEAD>
<P>PIETY, and gratitude to God, contribute, in a high degree, to enliven pro&s;perity. Gratitude is a plea&s;ing emotion. The &s;en&s;e of being di&s;tingui&s;hed by the kindne&s;s of another, gladdens the heart, warms it with reciprocal affection, and gives to any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which is agreeable in it&s;elf, a double reli&s;h, from its being the gift of a friend. Favours conferred by men, I acknowledge may prove burden&s;ome. For human virtue is never perfect; and &s;ometimes unrea&s;onable expectations on the one &s;ide, &s;ometimes a mortifying &s;en&s;e of dependence on the other, corrode in &s;ecret the plea&s;ure of benefits, and convert the obligations of friend&s;hip into grounds of jealou&s;y. But nothing of this kind can affect the intercour&s;e of gratitude with Heaven. Its favours are wholly di&s;intere&s;ted; and with a gratitude the mo&s;t cordial and un&s;u&s;pici|ous, a good man looks up to that Almighty Benefactor, who aims at no end but the happine&s;s of tho&s;e whom he ble&s;&s;es, and who de&s;ires no return from them, but a devout and thankful heart. While others can trace their pro&s;perity to no higher &s;ource than a concurrence of worldly cau&s;es; and often, of mean or trifling in|cidents, which occa&s;ionally favoured their de&s;igns; with what &s;uperior &s;atisfaction does the &s;ervant of God remark the hand of that Gracious Power which hath rai&s;ed him up; which hath happily conducted him through the various &s;teps of life, and crowned
<PB N="233" REF="035851_0270_1007AB762E0FCF20">
him with the mo&s;t favourable di&s;tinction beyond his equals!</P>
<P>Let us farther con&s;ider, that not only gratitude for the pa&s;t, but a cheering &s;en&s;e of Divine favour at the pre&s;ent, enters into the pious emotion. They are only the virtuous, who in their pro&s;perous days hear this voice addre&s;&s;ed to them, "Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a cheerful heart; for God now accepteth thy works." He who is the Author of their pro&s;perity, gives them a title to enjoy, with complacency, his own gift. While bad men &s;natch the plea&s;ures of the world as by &s;tealth, without countenance from the Great Proprietor of the world; the righteous &s;it openly down to the fea&s;t of life, under the &s;mile of approving Heaven. No guilty fears damp their joys. The ble&s;&s;ing of God re&s;ts upon all that they po&s;&s;e&s;s; his protection&punc; &s;ur|rounds them; and hence, "in the habitations of the righteous, is found the voice of rejoicing and &s;alva|tion." A lu&s;tre unknown to others, inve&s;ts, in their &s;ight, the whole face of nature. Their piety reflects a &s;un&s;hine from heaven upon the pro&s;perity of the world; unites in one point of view, the &s;miling a&s;pect, both of the powers above, and of the objects below. Not only have they as full a reli&s;h as others, of the innocent plea&s;ures of life, but, moreover, in the&s;e they hold communion with their Divine Benefactor. In all that is good or fair, they trace his hand. From the beauties of nature, from the improvements of art, from the enjoyments of &s;ocial life, they rai&s;e their affection to the &s;ource of all the happine&s;s which &s;urrounds them; and thus widen the &s;phere of their plea&s;ures, by adding intellectual, and &s;piritual, to earthly joys.</P>

<P>THE city of Sidon having &s;urrendered to Alex|ander, he ordered Hephe&s;tion to be&s;tow the crown on him whom the Sidonians &s;hould think mo&s;t worthy of that honour. Hephe&s;tion being at that time re|&s;ident with two young men of di&s;tinction, offered them the kingdom; but they refu&s;ed it, telling him that it was contrary to the laws of their country, to admit any one to that honour, who was not of the royal family. He then, having expre&s;&s;ed his admi|ration of their di&s;intere&s;ted &s;pirit, de&s;ired them to name one of the royal, race, who might remem|ber that he received the crown through their hands. Overlooking many, who would have been ambitious of this high honour, they made choice of Abdolonymus, who&s;e &s;ingular merit had rendered him con&s;picuous, even in the vale of ob&s;curity. Though remotely related to the royal family, a &s;eries of misfortunes had reduced him to the nece&s;&s;ity of cultivating a garden, for a &s;mall &s;tipend, in the &s;uburbs of the city.</P>
<P>While Abdolonymus was bu&s;ily employed in weed|ing his garden, the two friends of Hephe&s;tion, bear|ing

in their hands the en&s;igns of royalty, approached him, and &s;aluted him king. They informed him that Alexander had appointed him to that office; and re|quired him immediately to exchange his ru&s;tic garb, and uten&s;ils of hu&s;bandry, for the regal robe and &s;ceptre. At the &s;ame time, they admoni&s;hed him, when he &s;hould be &s;eated on the throne, and have a nation in his power, not to forget the humble con|dition from which he had been rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>All this, at the fir&s;t, appeared to Abdolonymus as an illu&s;ion of the fancy, or an in&s;ult offered to his poverty. He reque&s;ted them not to trouble him far|ther with their impertinent je&s;ts; and to find &s;ome other way of amu&s;ing them&s;elves, which might leave him in the peaceable enjoyment of his ob&s;cure habi|tation.&mdash;At length, however, they convinced him, that they were &s;erious in their propo&s;al; and prevailed upon him to accept the regal office, and accompany them to the palace.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was he in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government, than pride and envy created him enemies; who whi&s;|pered their murmurs in every place, till at la&s;t they reached the ear of Alexander. He commanded the new-elected prince to be &s;ent for; and required of him, with what temper of mind he had borne his poverty. "Would to Heaven," replied Abdolony|mus, "that I may be able to bear my crown with equal moderation: for when I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed little, I wanted nothing: the&s;e hands &s;upplied me with what|ever I de&s;ired." From this an&s;wer, Alexander formed &s;o high an idea of his wi&s;dom, that he confirmed the choice which had been made; and annexed a neighbouring province to the government of Sidon.</P>

I have no rea|&s;on to complain of fortune: &s;he &s;upplies me with all that nature requires; and if I am without &s;uperfluities, I am al&s;o free from the de&s;ire of them.

<P>NO PRINCE, &s;o little enterpri&s;ing and &s;o inoffen&s;ive, was ever &s;o much expo&s;ed to the oppo&s;ite extremes of calumny and flattery, of &s;atire and panegyric. And the factions which began in his time, being &s;till con|tinued, have made his character be as much di&s;puted to this day, as is commonly that of princes who are our contemporaries. Many virtues, however, it mu&s;t be owned, he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; but not one of them pure, or free from the contagion of the neighbouring vices. His genero&s;ity bordered on profu&s;ion, his learn|ing on pedantry, his pacific di&s;po&s;ition on pu&s;illani|mity, his wi&s;dom on cunning, his friend&s;hip on light fancy, and boyi&s;h fondne&s;s. While he imagined that he was only maintaining his own authority, he may perhaps be &s;u&s;pected in &s;ome of his actions, and &s;till more of his preten&s;ions, to have encroached on the

<P>His intentions were ju&s;t, but more adapted to the conduct of private life, than to the government of kingdoms. Awkward in his per&s;on, and ungainly in his manners, he was ill qualified to command re&s;pect: partial and undi&s;cerning in his affections, he was little fitted to acquire general love. Of a feeble temper, more than of a frugal judgment; expo&s;ed to our ridi|cule from his vanity, but exempt from our hatred by his freedom from pride and arrogance. And, upon the whole, it may be pronounced of his character, that all his qualities were &s;ullied with weakne&s;s, and embelli&s;hed by humanity. Political courage he was certainly devoid of; and from thence chiefly is de|rived the &s;trong prejudice, which prevails again&s;t his per&s;onal bravery: an inference, however, which mu&s;t be owned, from general experience, to be extremely fallacious.</P>

to re&s;ign his kingdoms; and to withdraw entirely from any concern in bu&s;ine&s;s or the affairs of this world, in order that he might &s;pend the remainder of his days in retirement and &s;olitude.

Several in&s;tances, indeed, occur in hi&s;tory, of monarchs who have quitted a throne, and have ended their days in retirement. But they were either weak princes, who took this re&s;olution ra&s;hly, and repented of it as &s;oon as it was taken; or unfor|tunate princes, from who&s;e hands &s;ome &s;trong rival had wre&s;ted their &s;ceptre, and compelled them to de&s;cend with reluctance into a private &s;tation.

The pre&s;ident of the council of Flan|ders, by his command, explained, in a few words, his intention in calling this extraordinary meeting of the &s;tates. He then read the in&s;trument of re&s;igna|tion, by which Charles &s;urrendered to his &s;on Philip all his territories, juri&s;diction, and authority in the Low Countries; ab&s;olving his &s;ubjects there from their oath of allegiance to him, which he required them to transfer to Philip his lawful heir; and to &s;erve him with the &s;ame loyalty and zeal that they had mani|fe&s;ted, during &s;o long a cour&s;e of years, in &s;upport of his government.</P>
<P>Charles then ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and leaning on the &s;houlder of the Prince of Orange, becau&s;e he was un|able to &s;tand without &s;upport, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the audience; and, from a paper which he held in his hand, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t his memory, he recounted, with dignity, but without o&s;tentation, all the great things which he had undertaken and performed, &s;ince the commencement of his admini&s;tration. He ob&s;er|ved, that from the &s;eventeenth year of his age, he
<PB N="242" REF="035851_0279_1007AB8BEE037310">
had dedicated all his thoughts and attention to pub|lic objects, re&s;erving no portion of his time for the indulgence of his ea&s;e, and very little for the enjoy|ment of private plea&s;ure; that either in a pacific or ho&s;tile m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nner, he had vi&s;ited Germany nine times, Spain &s;ix times, France four times, Italy &s;e|ven times, the Low Countries ten times, England twice, Africa as often, and had made eleven voyages by &s;ea; that while his health permitted him to di&s;|charge his duty, and the vigour of his con&s;titution was equal in any degree to the arduous office of govern|ing &s;uch exten&s;ive dominions, he had never &s;hunned labour, nor repined under fatigue; that now, when his health was broken, and his vigour exhau&s;ted by the rage of an incurable di&s;temper, his growing infirmi|ties admoni&s;hed him to retire; nor was he &s;o fond of reigning, as to retain the &s;ceptre in an impotent hand, which was no longer able to protect his &s;ubjects, or to render them happy; that in&s;tead of a &s;overeign worn out with di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;carcely half alive, he gave them one in the prime of life, accu&s;tomed already to govern, and who added to the vigour of youth all the attention and &s;agacity of maturer years; that if, dur|ing the cour&s;e of a long admini&s;tration, he had com|mitted any material error in government, or if, under the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;o many and great affairs, and amid&s;t the attention which he had been obliged to give to them, he had either neglected or injured any of his &s;ubjects, he now implored their forgivene&s;s; that, for his part, he &s;hould ever retain a grateful &s;en&s;e of their fidelity and attachment, and would carry the remem|brance of it along with him to the place of his retreat, as his &s;weete&s;t con&s;olation, as well as the be&s;t reward
<PB N="243" REF="035851_0280_1007AB8D77F0A208">
for all his &s;ervices; and, in his la&s;t prayers to Al|mighty God, would pour forth his ardent wi&s;hes for their welfare.</P>
<P>Then turning towards Philip, who fell on his knees and ki&s;&s;ed his father's hand, "If," &s;ays he, "I had left you, by my death, this rich inheritance, to which I have made &s;uch large additions, &s;ome regard would have been ju&s;tly due to my memory on that account; but now, when I voluntarily re&s;ign to you what I might have &s;till retained, I may well expect the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of thanks on your part. With the&s;e, however, I di&s;pen&s;e; and &s;hall con&s;ider your concern for the welfare of your &s;ubjects, and your love of them, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t acceptable te&s;ti|mony of your gratitude to me. It is in your power, by a wi&s;e and virtuous admini&s;tration, to ju&s;tify the extraordinary proof which I give this day of my pa|ternal affection, and to demon&s;trate that you are wor|thy of the confidence which I repo&s;e in you. Pre|&s;erve an inviolable regard for religion; maintain the Catholic faith in its purity; let the laws of your country be &s;acred in your eyes; encroach not on the rights and privileges of your people; and if the time &s;hall ever come, when you &s;hall wi&s;h to enjoy the tranquillity of private life, may you have a &s;on en|dowed with &s;uch qualities, that you can re&s;ign your &s;ceptre to him, with as much &s;atisfaction as I give up mine to you."</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Charles had fini&s;hed this long addre&s;s to his &s;ubjects, and to their new &s;overeign, he &s;unk into the chair, exhau&s;ted and ready to faint with the fatigue of &s;uch an extraordinary effort. During his di&s;cour&s;e, the whole audience melted into tears; &s;ome from
<PB N="244" REF="035851_0281_1007AB8FE1154CA0">
admiration of his magnanimity; others &s;oftened by the expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s towards his &s;on, and of love to his people; and all were affected with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow, at lo&s;ing a &s;overeign, who had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the Netherlands, his native country, with par|ticular marks of his regard and attachment.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXVII. Continuation of the Emperour Charles V.</HEAD>
<P>A FEW weeks after the re&s;ignation of the Nether|lands, Charles, in an a&s;&s;embly no le&s;s &s;plendid, and with a ceremonial equally pompous, re&s;igned to his &s;on the crowns of Spain, with all the territories de|pending on them, both in the old and in the new world. Of all the&s;e va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he re&s;erved no|thing for him&s;elf, but an annual pen&s;ion of an hundred thou&s;and crowns, to defray the charges of his family, and to afford him a &s;mall &s;um for acts of beneficence and charity.</P>
<P>Nothing now remained to detain him from that ret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> for which he langui&s;hed. Every thing having been prepared &s;ome time for his voyage, he &s;et out for Zuitburg in Zealand, where the fleet had orders to rendevous. In his way thither, he pa&s;&s;ed through Ghent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; and after &s;topping there a few days, to in|dulge that tender and plea&s;ant melancholy, which ari&s;es in the mind of every man in the decline of life, on vi&s;iting the place of his nativity, and viewing the &s;cenes and objects familiar to him in his early youth, he pur&s;ued his journey, accompanied by his &s;on Philip, his daughter the Arch-duche&s;s, his &s;i&s;ters the Dowager Queens of France and Hungary, Maximilian his &s;on-in-law,
<PB N="245" REF="035851_0282_1007AB935B582AF8">
and a numerous retinue of the Flemi&s;h nobility. Before he went on board, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, with marks of his attention or regard; and taking leave of Philip with all the tenderne&s;s of a father who em|braced his &s;on for the la&s;t time, he &s;et fail under con|voy of a large fleet of Spani&s;h, Flemi&s;h, and Engli&s;h &s;hips.</P>
<P>His voyage was pro&s;perous and agreeable; and he arrived at Laredo in Bi&s;cay, on the eleventh day after he left Zealand. As &s;oon as he landed, he fell pro|&s;trate on the ground; and con&s;idering him&s;elf now as dead to the world, he ki&s;&s;ed the earth, and &s;aid, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked I now return to thee, thou common mother of man|kind." From Laredo he proceeded to Valladolid. There he took a la&s;t and tender leave of his two &s;i&s;|ters; whom he would not permit to accompany him to his &s;olitude, though they entreated it with tears; not only that they might have the con&s;olation of con|tributing, by their attendance and care, to mitigate or to &s;ooth his &s;ufferings, but that they might reap in&s;truction and benefit, by joining with him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pious exerci&s;es, to which he had con&s;ecrated the re|mainder of his days.</P>
<P>From Valladolid, he continued his journey to Pla|zencia in E&s;tremadura. He had pa&s;&s;ed through that city a great many years before; and having been &s;truck at that time with the delightful &s;ituation of the mona&s;tery of St. Ju&s;tus, belonging to the order of St. Jerome, not many miles di&s;tant from that place, he had then ob&s;erved to &s;ome of his attendants, that this was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ot to which Diocle&s;ian might have re|tired with plea&s;ure. The impre&s;&s;ion had remained &s;o
<PB N="246" REF="035851_0283_1007AB95BA0A8928">
&s;trong on his mind, that he pitched upon it as the place of his retreat. It was &s;eated in a vale of no great extent, watered by a &s;mall brook, and &s;ur|rounded by ri&s;ing grounds, covered with lofty trees: from the nature of the &s;oil, as well as the temperature of the climate, it was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t healthful and delicious &s;ituation in Spain. Some months before his re&s;ignation, he had &s;ent an architect thither, to add a new apartment to the mona&s;tery, for his accommo|dation; but he gave &s;trict orders, that the &s;tyle of the building &s;hould be &s;uch as &s;uited his pre&s;ent &s;tation, rather than his former dignity. It con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ix rooms, four of them in the form of friars' cells, with naked walls; the other two, each twenty feet &s;quare, were hung with brown cloth, and furni&s;hed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mo&s;t &s;imple manner. They were all on a level with the ground; with a door on one &s;ide into a garden, of which Charles him&s;elf had given the plan, and had filled it with various plants, which he propo&s;ed to cul|tivate with his own hands. On the other &s;ide, they communicated with the chapel of the mona&s;tery, in wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> he was to perform his devotions. Into this humble retreat, hardly &s;ufficient for the comfortable accommodation of a private gentleman, did Charles enter, with twelve dome&s;tics only. He buried there, in &s;olitude and &s;ilence, his grandeur, his ambition, together with all tho&s;e va&s;t projects, which during half a century, had alarmed and agitated Europe; filling every kingdom in it by turns, with the terrour of his arms, and the dread of being &s;ubjected to his power.</P>
<P>In this retirement Charles formed &s;uch a plan of life for him&s;elf, as would have &s;uited the condition of
<PB N="247" REF="035851_0284_1007AB974615FBC0">
a private per&s;on of a moderate fortune. His table was neat but plain; his dome&s;tics few; his inter|cour&s;e with them familiar; all the cumber&s;ome and ceremonious forms of attendance on his per&s;on were entirely aboli&s;hed, as de&s;tructive of that &s;ocial ea&s;e and tranquillity, which he courted, in order to &s;ooth the remainder of his days. As the mildne&s;s of the climate, together with his deliverance from the bur|dens and cares of government, procured him, at fir&s;t, a con&s;iderable remi&s;&s;ion from the acute pains with which he had been long tormented, he enjoyed, per|haps, more complete &s;atisfaction in this humble &s;o|litude, than all his grandeur had ever yielded him. The ambitious thoughts and projects, which had &s;o long engro&s;&s;ed and di&s;quieted him, were quite effaced from his mind. Far from taking any part in the po|litical tran&s;actions of the princes of Europe, he re|&s;trained his curio&s;ity even from any inquiry concern|ing them; and he &s;eemed to view the bu&s;y &s;cene which he had abandoned, with all the contempt and indifference ari&s;ing from his thorough experience o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> its vanity, as well as from the plea&s;ing reflection o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> having di&s;entangled, him&s;elf from its cares.</P>

<HEAD>Engli&s;h Reviewers' Character of the preceding Work.</HEAD>
<P>"The plan of this work is highly commendable, and the execution is good. We are particularly plea&s;ed with the Compiler's having avoided every &s;entiment that might gratify a corrupt mind, or, in the lea&s;t degree, offend the eye or ear of Innocence." <HI>Gentleman's Magazine, February,</HI> 1799.</P>
<P>"There is very con&s;iderable merit in this compilation, the contents of which are pretty equally made up of the agreeable and the u&s;eful. After a careful in&s;pection, we feel our&s;elves bound in ju&s;tice to remark, that it compri&s;es much more novel|ty, than any compilation of the &s;ame &s;ize, that ever came into our hands. Three objects are propo&s;ed by Mr. Murray, in giving this volume to the world: fir&s;t, to improve youth in the indi&s;pen&s;able art of reading; &s;econdly, to meliorate their lan|guage and &s;entiments; and thirdly, to inculcate &s;ome of the mo&s;t important principles of piety and virtue.&mdash;The articles &s;elected for the fir&s;t of the&s;e purpo&s;es, are peculiarly calculated for exerci&s;ing the various pau&s;es, inflexions, and modulations of the voice: they are judiciou&s;ly diver&s;ified and proportioned and accurately punctuated.&mdash;In pur&s;uance of his &s;econd object Mr. Murray has made his &s;elections from the mo&s;t correct and elegant writers; and purity, propriety, and per&s;picuity, of cour&s;e, characterize them.&mdash;In his third department, we find extracts &s;trongly tending to promote piety and virtue. They place religion in the mo&s;t amiable light; and recommend the moral duties, by proving the excellence of their nature, and the happy effects which they produce. In no part of the work do we meet with an expre&s;&s;ion that might gratify a corrupt, or vitiate a pure mind; nor a &s;entiment that can offend the ear of innocence. The Peru&s;al of the Sacred Scriptures is powerful|ly recommended, by the frequent in&s;ertion of the mo&s;t &s;ublime, beautiful, and intere&s;ting pa&s;&s;ages of the&s;e invaluable writings. But, though the general ca&s;t of the volume partakes more of the grave than the gay, yet it is not without a con&s;iderable portion of rational amu&s;ement; and as it is &s;erious without enthu&s;ia&s;m or &s;uper&s;tition, &s;o it is cheerful without levity.&mdash;We do not fear di&s;crediting our judgment, by recommending</P>
