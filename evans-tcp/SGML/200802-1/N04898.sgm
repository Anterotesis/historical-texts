It was this, that animated their Obedience; carried them through the heavie&s;t Trials; overcame the greate&s;t Diffi|culties; and made them more than Conquerors over their mo&s;t formidable Enemies. It was this, that made <HI>the Fee|ble as David,</HI> and the Strong as <HI>the Angel of the Lord.</HI> It was this, that enabled <HI>Martyrs</HI> patiently and joyfully to en|dure the utmo&s;t Cruelty of their Per&s;ecutors, and the mo&s;t <HI>warlike valiant Soldiers</HI> to exceed them&s;elves, and do Won|ders again&s;t their Enemies.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e la&s;t Feats of Faith the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks in the Text. He mentions by Name, &s;everal <HI>Heroes</HI> renowned in the Church of God in their Day, for their Valour and Victories over the Enemies of God's People. The Hi&s;tory of their Exploits is pre&s;erved in the &s;acred Records, and was written for our Learning and Admonition; as we learn from the U&s;e the Apo&s;tle makes of it in this Place. In &s;etting down their Names, he ob&s;erves not the Order of Story, aiming only at mentioning their &s;ignal Acts of Cou|rage and Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>In the Story we find them all, except <HI>Barak,</HI> eminent for their Fortitude. <HI>Gideon</HI> was &s;aluted by the Angel, as <HI>a mighty Man of Valour</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Judg. vi. 12.</NOTE> And tho' <HI>Barak,</HI> at the Time when God called him, and put him into Commi&s;&s;ion of <HI>General</HI> of the Army again&s;t the Enemies of his People, di&s;covered &s;omething of a timerous Spirit; yet doubtle&s;s he was well known to be a Man of good Courage, and there|fore God cho&s;e him for that important Tru&s;t and Service.

<P>The&s;e heroic Men in their Wars again&s;t the Enemies of their People, u&s;ed their be&s;t Policy, and acted their natural Courage: They fought valiantly, and play'd the Men for their God, and for the Cities of their God; and they gain'd compleat Victories. Their martial Atchievements, <HI>humane Rea&s;on</HI> may be ready to a&s;cribe to their &s;uperiour Courage and Conduct; and to look no higher: But the Apo&s;tle takes not the lea&s;t Notice of them, but a&s;cribes them to their <HI>Faith only.</HI> It was their Faith gave them Courage, and procured them Succe&s;s. Their Strength of Body, Forti|tude of Mind, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ilitary Skill were <HI>natural Cau&s;es</HI> of their Succe&s;s: But the&s;e alone would never have enabled them to do &s;uch great Exploits upon their Enemies, who po&s;&s;ibly might equal them in all the natural and acquired Accom|pli&s;hments of Soldiers; and far overmatch them in the Number, Strength and Artillery of their Armies. It was their Faith that differenced them from their Enemies: This gave them the Advantage; and was more and better to them, than Troops of Hor&s;es, Chariots of Iron, and all other In&s;truments of War were to their Enemies: This encouraged their Hearts and &s;trengthened their Hands: Made them valorous and victorious: This gave the fi|ni&s;hing Stroke to their other military Qualifications, and was the Crown of all. This in&s;pired them with Courage and Re&s;olution, made them undaunted at the Approach of Enemies, intripid in the mo&s;t bloody Scenes of War, and <HI>valiant in Fight:</HI> This crowned their valiant Attempts with Succe&s;s, <HI>turned to Flight the Armies of the Aliens,</HI> tho&s;e that were Aliens to their Common-Wealth, and Enemies to their Religion: And this enabled them to make proper Advantage of their Victories, <HI>to &s;ubdue Kingdoms under them,</HI> and make them tributary.</P>

The proud Hearts of Men are prone to take the Glory of their Courage and Succe&s;s to them&s;elves, as if they had given them&s;elves their Courage, and by the Might of their Hand alone had gotten them Victory: But the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> attributes it wholly to their Faith, to &s;hew that it was all of God: That the <HI>wi&s;e Man &s;hould not glory in his Wi&s;dom, nor the mighty Man in his Might</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. ix. 23.</NOTE>; But that <HI>he that glorieth &s;hould glory in the Lord</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 31.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e Per&s;ons here &s;poken of, were all of them Leaders of Armies, except <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> who had the Force of an Army in him&s;elf: And we find they were as famous for their Faith, as for their Prowe&s;s. Doubtle&s;s they had many Soldiers in their Armies that had Faith as well as they; which gave <HI>them</HI> the &s;ame valorous martial Spirit that their Leaders had; and enabled them, in their Places, to act as valiantly in Battle, as their Leaders did in their's. <Q>Believing and praying Commanders, at the Head of be|lieving and praying Armies, have been &s;o owned and ho|noured of God, that nothing can &s;tand before them.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Ob&s;ervation</HI> from the Words, by divine Leave and Help to be &s;poken to, may be this, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>That <HI>true Faith makes the be&s;t Soldiers, the mo&s;t valiant and &s;ucce&s;sful.</HI></P>
<P>It is a Day of War and Trouble in the Land.&mdash;When Enemies unju&s;tly ri&s;e up again&s;t us, and do all the Mi&s;|chief they can, it is lawful and a Duty to take up Arms, and &s;tand in our own Defence; yea, and to go forth to War again&s;t them. <HI>Good Soldiers,</HI> under God, are our Defence and Safety.&mdash;But what &s;hall the People of God do for <HI>good Soldiers?</HI> What Method mu&s;t be taken to make our Men &s;uch?&mdash;They who have the Honour to bear a Commi&s;&s;ion in the <HI>Militia,</HI> &s;hould doubtle&s;s take

Pains to furni&s;h them&s;elves with a good Knowledge in military Affairs, and then, &s;hould be faithful in training their Companies; &s;hould make a Bu&s;ine&s;s of teaching their Men the right U&s;e of the Gun and Sword, and whatever el&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary for them to be acquainted with: And they &s;hould &s;ee to it, that their Soldiers under Arms, keep good Order, and attend to their Duty.&mdash;But when Men have perfected them&s;elves in this Knowledge, they will be far from being good Soldiers, if they have not <HI>good Cou|rage.</HI> This is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make a Soldier. If a Man had a Body as bulky as <HI>Goliah'</HI>s, a Head as wife as <HI>Solomon'</HI>s, and an Arm as &s;trong as <HI>Samp&s;on'</HI>s, but a Heart like a <HI>Hare,</HI> Could this Man make a Soldier? What avail the large and branchy Horns of the <HI>Stagg,</HI> &s;ince he &s;tarts and runs at the Bark of a Dog? <HI>A Coward is no Soldier:</HI> He cannot keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Soul, nor find his Hands, nor u&s;e his Arms, in the Time of Battle and Danger.</P>
<P>Men have invented and u&s;e a Variety of artificial Me|thods to in&s;pire them&s;elves and one another with Courage: The Beat of Drums, the Bla&s;t of Trumpets, and Shouting for the Battle; the&s;e may &s;omewhat rou&s;e the Spirits, and breed a Kind of <HI>brutal</HI> Courage, a wild and mad Fury, like that of the <HI>War-Hor&s;e;</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Job. xxxix. 21,&mdash;</NOTE> <HI>who faith among the Trumpets, Ha, ha, goeth on to meet the armed Men, mocketh at Fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth back from the Sword; &s;walloweth the Ground with Fiercene&s;s and Rage,</HI> and ru&s;hes into the Battle. This is fal&s;e Courage, purely a mecha|nical Bu&s;ine&s;s: It hurries Men on precipitately into the Mouth of Danger, without Thought or Wit, Con&s;ide|ration or Conduct; and often leaves them when they have the greate&s;t Need. It degenerates into Fear and Cow|ardi&s;e. It is a &s;udden Flu&s;h of the Spirits, which quickly goes off, like the <HI>Crackling of Thorns under a Pot,</HI> makes a great Noi&s;e and Blaze, but is &s;oon over.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="006128_0008_1027F007FA2456A0">
<HI>True Valour,</HI> or Fortitude, is an excellent Vertue, the Mean between Temerity and Timerou&s;ne&s;s; as the Poet &s;ays,
<Q><L>&mdash;Courage dwells not in a troubled Flood</L>
<L>Of mounting Spirits, and fermenting Blood;</L>
<L>Lodg'd in the Soul with Virtue over-rul'd,</L>

<P>It will not fooli&s;hly and needle&s;ly run upon the Point of the Sword, or Muzzel of the Gun; nor will it thro' Fear neglect a Duty, nor quit a Po&s;t becau&s;e of Danger. True Courage makes the Soldier patient in Labours, un|wearied in Fight, compos'd in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion of Battle; bold and intrepid in the mid&s;t of Enemies. The Thunder of the Captains, Cla&s;hing of Swords, Roaring of Cannon, Shouts of Enemies, Groans of Friends, Clouds of Du&s;t and Smoke, all the Terrors of War, do not in the lea&s;t di&s;courage him. The truly couragious Man will not pre&s;umptuou&s;ly throw away his Life, nor &s;neekingly &s;ave it: He neither wi&s;hes for Death, nor fears it.</P>
<P>This manly rational Temper of Mind is not the Effect of Noi&s;e and Sounds only. Martial In&s;truments of Mu&s;ic may well be u&s;ed: The <HI>Drum</HI> and <HI>Trumpet</HI> naturally tend to fire the Soul, work upon animal Nature, and breed a Kind of Courage; but as <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid in another Ca&s;e, <HI>I &s;hew you a more excellent Way</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xii. 31.</NOTE>; more rational and divine, more accommodate to us as Men and Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>True Courage will make Soldiers bold and daring, in|&s;pire them with the be&s;t Courage, mo&s;t &s;olid and la&s;ting; &s;uch a Courage as will make them undaunted, not fearing the Force of their Adver&s;aries; no, tho' they be like the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> of old, <HI>a bitter and ha&s;ty Nation, terrible and dreadful, of a fierce Countenance and hard Language.</HI> This will enable them to &s;tand the Shock of Armies, and drive

home upon the Foe; and the more fierce and furious their Enemies are, the more will their Faith whet up their Courage, add Vigour to their Minds, and Strength to their Arms. This is the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> that <HI>is better than Strength,</HI> yea <HI>than Weapons of War.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccl. ix. 16, 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>And Faith gives the be&s;t A&s;&s;urance of <HI>Succe&s;s.</HI> Succe&s;s goes a great Way in e&s;tabli&s;hing and aggrandizing the Sol|dier's Character. Succe&s;s indeed is not always a certain Evidence of the be&s;t Soldier. A mo&s;t expert and valiant General, with an Army better di&s;ciplin'd, equip'd and po&s;ted, and con&s;i&s;ting of more &s;turdy, re&s;olute and bold Men, thro' &s;ome unfore&s;een Accident, &s;ome unexpected Turn of Providence, the Change of the Wind and Wea|ther, may thro' their too great Boldne&s;s, and pur&s;uing the Enemy too far, loo&s;e the Day: <HI>The Race is not</HI> always <HI>to the Swi&s;t, nor the Battle to the Strong; but Time and Chance happens to all.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. ix. 11.</NOTE> There is a &s;ecret, powerful, over|ruling Providence, that determineth Events, quite cro&s;s to the natural Tendency of Things, and the rational Ex|pectations of Men. But true Faith gives Soldiers the be&s;t Rea&s;on to hope they &s;hall be pro&s;per'd in all their Engage|ments again&s;t their Enemies; and that the Event of the Battle, at lea&s;t of the War, will be in their Favour.</P>
<P>Now that Faith makes the be&s;t Soldiers the mo&s;t valiant and &s;ucce&s;sful, we learn from the <HI>Heroes</HI> in the Text. By reading the Hi&s;tory of their Wars, we find that they behaved valiantly in Fight; and that their Valour was crowned with Succe&s;s. They fought with Armies va&s;tly &s;uperiour to their own, in Re&s;pect of Numbers and mili|tary Accoutrements; and yet their Enemies were not able to &s;tand before them: Yea, <HI>Kings did flee away apace.</HI> From the Blood of the Slain, from the Fat of the Mighty, their Bow turned not back, nor did their Sword return

empty. They &s;eldom or ever fought a <HI>Battle,</HI> but they gain'd a <HI>Victory.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;o it was in <HI>After-times,</HI> when the Faith of God's People was &s;trong and lively. What and how many nota|ble <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ctories did <HI>Judas Maccabaeus</HI> win over the Enemies of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> People?

It was their Faith in God that gave them this Spirit, Courage and Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>If we come down to <HI>later Times,</HI> we &s;hall find Faith animating the Hearts of Chri&s;tian Soldiers in the &s;ame Manner, and crowning them with Succe&s;s. In the Hi&s;tory of the Per&s;ecutions and Wars of the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fox'</HI>s Acts and Monuments.</NOTE>, a godly People, and full of Faith, we &s;ee how valiantly they de|fended them&s;elves from their Enemies, tho' they were but few in Number, and poorly furni&s;hed with Weapons of War; nay, and not only defended them&s;elves, but ma|ny Times drove their numerous and enraged Enemies be|fore them. It was their Faith in God that made them thus valiant and victorious. They were good Soldiers of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> valiant for the Truth; and God gave them a Spirit and Courage that all their Enemies were not able to with&s;tand.</P>
<P>Should we come down to the <HI>Days and Wars of our Fore-fathers in this Country,</HI> we &s;hall &s;ee the &s;ame Fruits of Faith? They were a holy praying Generation; Men of &s;trong Faith, and eminent Piety: And their Faith gave them Courage again&s;t their numerous &s;alvage Ene|mies, and help'd them to the &s;ignal Victories they gain'd over them. We may &s;ay of them as <HI>David</HI> did of his Ance&s;tors: <HI>Our Fathers tru&s;ted in thee: They tru&s;ted and thou did&s;t deliver them. They cried unto thee and were de|livered&punc;

They tru&s;ted in thee and were not confounded</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxii. 4, 5.</NOTE>. Nay, &s;o far from it, that they waxed valiant in Fight, and turned to Flight the Armies of the Aliens.</P>
<P>And what was it made our Officers and Soldiers &s;o va|liant and victorious in the Siege of <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> that &s;trong and almo&s;t impregnable Fortre&s;s? Was it not Faith? Were not many good Men, Men of Faith and Prayer en|gaged in it? Doubtle&s;s it would be a Wrong to their Faith, not to attribute their Courage and Succe&s;s to that.</P>
<P>A &s;mall Army with great Faith, will do more than a great Army without Faith, tho' it have all nece&s;&s;ary and convenient Weapons of War. This we have an In&s;tance of in <HI>Abraham,</HI> that ancient renowned Believer; he with his Hou&s;hold Troops, <HI>three hundred and eighteen Men,</HI> ob|tained a Victory over <HI>four Kings,</HI> who ju&s;t before had pre|vailed again&s;t <HI>five Kings</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xiv. 14, 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>But <HI>what is this Faith that in&s;pires Soldiers with &s;uch un|common Courage, and crowns them with &s;uch Succe&s;s?</HI></P>
<P>It is not a vain pre&s;umptuous Confidence, a groundle&s;s enthu&s;ia&s;tic Per&s;wa&s;ion, ari&s;ing in the Mind from an over|weening Conceit of our own Goodne&s;s, and of our peculiar Intere&s;t in the &s;pecial Love of God: It is not any &s;udden unaccountable Impre&s;&s;ion and Impul&s;e upon the Mind, that God will infallibly defend us, and de&s;troy our Enemies. It is no proud vapouring Imagination, nor Satanic Delu|&s;ion.&mdash;No:</P>

<P><HI>Faith repre&s;ents the Enemies of God's People in a dimi|ni&s;hing Light.</HI> Unbelief and carnal Fear are apt to mag|nify them. As, They are &s;o numerous, &s;o expert in their Di&s;cipline, &s;o well furni&s;h'd with all Kinds of Wea|pons, and withal, as they are &s;uch mighty Men, and are en|raged; and we, compared with them, are few in Num|ber, poor and unprovided, have no Might nor Strength. But Faith gives God's People quite another View and Account of them, dimini&s;hes them as much as Sen&s;e and Unbelief magnified them. The unbelieving <HI>Spies</HI> made Report of the Inhabitants of <HI>Canaan,</HI> That <HI>all the People that they &s;aw in it were Men of great Stature: And there they &s;aw the Giants the Sons of</HI> Anak, <HI>and that they were in their own Sight as Gra&s;hoppers, and &s;uch in their Sight</HI> too<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Numb. xiii. 32, 33.</NOTE>: Little, weak, contemptible In&s;ects.

Where Faith thus le&s;&s;ens Enemies, it will rai&s;e and keep up the Soldiers Courage in fighting with them. Whatever mighty Shews their Enemies make, how for|midable &s;oever they appear in Battle-array, and how loud and threatening &s;oever their Words may be, Faith &s;hews

them, That <HI>they are Men and not God, and their Hor&s;es Fle&s;h and not Spirit;</HI> weak and mortal Creatures. Over|rating an Enemy breeds Di&s;couragement, damps the Spirits, and awakens Fear: But &s;eeing them by the Eyes of Faith dimini&s;hed to almo&s;t nothing, &s;trengthens the feeble Knees, rai&s;es up the Hands that hang down, and recovers the fainting Spirits.</P>
<P>Carnal Soldiers many times make U&s;e of &s;omething like this to to fortify their Minds, and keep up their Spirits. They endeavour to think meanly of their Enemies, and they &s;peak contemptibly of them, as having neither Skill nor Valour; But Faith does this mo&s;t &s;atifyingly to the Soul.</P>
<P><HI>Faith excites a mighty Spirit of Prayer.</HI> Faith and Prayer ever go together; and the &s;tronger Faith is, the more fervent is Prayer. Believing Soldiers know they can call in the Help of God, when Things are come to the la&s;t Extremity, and are in &s;uch a de&s;perate Situation, that vain is the Help of Man. And they hope, that the God who hears Prayers, and delights in the Prayers of Faith, will &s;ome Way appear for them, open &s;ome Way of E|&s;cape, and pre&s;erve them from the Rage and Cruelty of their Enemies. Believing Soldiers can wre&s;tle with God, at the &s;ame Time they are combating with Men: They can &s;hoot up their Prayers to God in the Heavens, while they are di&s;charging their Shot upon the Enemy in the Field. This is a mighty Support to their Spirits, and begets in them a holy Confidence in God; in that they know, that where God gives a Spirit of Prayer, he is not wont to deny his People the Mercy they have pray'd unto him for. They know, that fervent believing Prayer can do more and greater Execution than Guns and Swords. <HI>The&s;e</HI> have Power with God, and prevail: And rather than the Enemy &s;hould prevail again&s;t an Army of Prayers, God will bow the Heavens and come down, fly upon the Wings of the Wind for their Help; mu&s;ter up the

<P><HI>Faith engages and realizes the gracious Pre&s;ence of God with his fighting People.</HI> It <HI>engages</HI> the Pre&s;ence of God with them.

By Faith in the Promi&s;e, the Believer has a fa&s;t Hold upon God, and God will not rend away from him. <HI>The Lord is with his People,</HI> in a Way of Grace and Fa|vour, <HI>while they are with him,</HI> in the Way of Faith and Duty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. xv. 2.</NOTE>.&mdash;And Faith <HI>realizes</HI> the gracious Pre&s;ence of God with them: That he goes forth with their Armies, accompanies them in the Field of Battle, beholds the Num|ber, Force and Rage of their Enemies, and <HI>their</HI> Weak|ne&s;s and Dependance upon him.

<HI>Faith &s;ees the Glory of God much intere&s;ted in the Wars of his People:</HI> And this fires them with Zeal and Cou|rage.

In this Ca&s;e they will not' count their Lives dear to them, nor love them to the Death.</P>
<P>One Thing that very much contributes to lead Soldiers on to gallant and brave Actions in Fight, is <HI>the Honour of their King and Country:</HI> For the Honour of their Prince, they will behave with the utmo&s;t Re&s;olution and Ob&s;tina|cy. Surely the Honour of God will as much &s;way with the believing Soldier, in fighting the Lord's Battles. Should the Enemy prevail, what would God do for his great Name? What would the bla&s;phemous <HI>AEgyptians</HI> &s;ay? And therefore to prevent their bla&s;phemous Reproaches, the Chri&s;tian Soldier is willing to jeopard his Life, and &s;pend his Blood. It is not &s;o much for the Honour of his <HI>King</HI> (tho' this is dear to him) as of his GOD, that he fights. It is the Cau&s;e of God, and Religion, and his People, he is fighting for: And the Tho't of this adds Vigour to his Spirit, and Force to his Arms.

He knows his E|nemies can have no Power again&s;t him, except it be given them from above: That not an Hair of his Head can fall to the Ground, much le&s;s a Drop of his Blood, or his Life, without the Will of his heavenly Father: And that God will give them no more Power again&s;t him, than &s;hall be mo&s;t for his Glory.

<P>Carnal old Soldiers are wont to keep up their Courage, by recounting how many Wars they have &s;erved in; how many Battles they have fought; what Dangers they have been in; what Wounds they have received; what narrow E&s;capes they have made with their Lives; and how ma|ny Victories they have won: The Remembrance of the&s;e Things in&s;pires them with fre&s;h Courage. But the Act|ings of Faith upon God's Works of Power and Mercy for his People, will do it much better. How mightily will this embolden the Soldier's Spirit, when his Faith a&s;&s;ures him, that <HI>this God of Salvation</HI> is the &s;ame God that ever he was; that his Arm is not &s;hortned, nor his Love abated.

<P><HI>Faith looks to the Glory and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the un&s;een eternal World;</HI> and this admini&s;ters Courage. <HI>Faith is the Evi|dence of Things not &s;een</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Context Ver. 1.</NOTE>: It gives a realizing pre&s;entiating View of another World, and of the great Good that is laid up for Believers there: And it begets a good Hope of coming to the Enjoyment of it, whenever God &s;hall call out of this World; yea, and &s;ometimes it enables the Chri&s;tian to &s;ee his Title to it: It ri&s;es up to <HI>the Riches of the full A&s;&s;urance of Faith and Hope.</HI> The Chri&s;tian thus rais'd in the Actings of Faith and Hope, has nothing to terrify him: He can with the greate&s;t Pre&s;ence of Mind, and un&s;haken Fortitude of Soul, ru&s;h into the mid&s;t of E|nemies and Danger, when Duty calls him.

Terror to him. When there is nothing but Blood and Death around him, his Heart is undaunted, becau&s;e his Faith &s;hews him a Crown of Life and Glory re&s;erved in the Heavens for him.</P>
<P>Carnal Soldiers look for only &s;ome temporal Reward, a Garland of Flowers, a little higher Po&s;t, a more honourable Commi&s;&s;ion; or to enrich them&s;elves with the Spoil of the Enemy, or, if they fall in Battle, to have it &s;aid of them, <HI>They died in the Bed of Honour.</HI> The&s;e are &s;orry trifling Con&s;iderations, and yet they &s;erve mightily to embolden them in Fight. But &s;urely, if Soldiers will make &s;uch ad|ventrous and de&s;perate Pu&s;hes on the Enemy, only for a <HI>corruptible Crown,</HI> the Honour that comes from Men; the Chri&s;tian Soldier's Faith will urge him on to do &s;o, for an <HI>Incorruptible.</HI> He that by Faith knows, that if he loo&s;es his Life on Earth, fighting the Cau&s;e of God and his Peo|ple, he &s;hall win a Crown in Heaven, <HI>a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory,</HI> will not <HI>count his Life dear to him.</HI> He that fights, and keeps Heaven in his Eye, will not want Courage. This Faith, which has render'd <HI>Mar|tyrs</HI> patient and joyful in the mid&s;t of Flames, will make Soldiers &s;o in the mo&s;t dreadful Scenes of War.</P>
<P>Thus Faith gives Soldiers the be&s;t Courage. And as I &s;aid before, the more lively and &s;trong the Actings of Faith are, the more and better is the Courage.</P>
<P>And Faith makes <HI>&s;ucce&s;sful</HI> Soldiers too. We find it &s;o in the many In&s;tances upon &s;acred Record.

Oh, the <HI>&s;olemn Promi&s;es</HI> he makes of living better for Time to come, if God will &s;pare his Life.&mdash;He dies in the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s and Agony of Soul, fill'd with a <HI>fearful Looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation, to devour him.</HI> But <HI>mark the perfect Man, and behold the Upright, for the End of that Man is Peace</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxxvii. 37.</NOTE>.</P>

Would you have this <HI>Faith,</HI> which is &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary, and eminently &s;erviceable, in managing every Kind of Warfare? <HI>Oh look up to God for it.</HI> Beg it by &s;ecret Prayer of the God of all Grace.
