<HEAD><HI>A Sketch of the Weather, from January to July,</HI> 1798.</HEAD>
<P>THE winter, preceding the &s;pring of 1798, was more &s;everely cold, and the cold continued longer than u&s;ual in this winter.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of March and April was wet and cold.</P>
<P>From the 4th of May to the 23d, there was no rain, though the wind was generally N. and N. E. and &s;ome days di&s;agreeably cold.</P>
<P>24th May, began to rain, and continued wet and cold to the 31&s;t. The wind then changed to S. W. and the weather became warm and fair.</P>
<P>From the 5th to the 14th of June there were dai|ly &s;howers, &s;ome days heavy, and one day loud thun|der. The ponds became full of water&mdash;the roads deep with mud. From the 16th to the 19th, un|plea&s;antly cold. From the 19th to the 26th, &s;ul|try, with frequent &s;howers. 27th, cool, Thermo|meter only 76 at two P. M. Mark Miller died to|day, under the care of doctors Wi&s;ter and Hodge, with &s;ymptoms of the Yellow Fever at Mrs. Reeves's in Gallowhill-&s;treet. He had been much fatigued and debilitated from loading a ve&s;&s;el at Almond-&s;treet wharf, a mile from his lodgings, in the heat of the day, to which he had walked daily for &s;ome time. He had, al&s;o, according to the account of Mrs. Reeves, &s;lept on the bed in which her &s;on had died of the Fever the preceding Autumn. Dr. Hodge was at this time indi&s;po&s;ed with jaundice from a di&s;ea&s;ed liver.</P>
<P>24th and 30th, fair and plea&s;ant, wind S. E.</P>
<P>The la&s;t week of June was remarkably healthy.</P>

<HEAD>Memories of the Fever and Occurrences in Augu&s;t</HEAD>
<P>ALEXANDER PHILIPS next door neighbour to A. Thomp&s;on was attacked with fever accom|panied with malignant &s;ymptoms on the la&s;t of July or fir&s;t of Augu&s;t; died under the care of Dr. Griffitts on the 4th in&s;t., being the 4th or 5th day from the Attack.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es Cox at corner of 2d and Spruce, died on the 6th.</P>
<P>John Saunders occupied in the &s;tore of Lloyd and Sparks on the wharf a &s;hort di&s;tance below Walnut St. attacked on the 3d.</P>
<P>Mr. Samuel Ru&s;&s;el clerk to Mr. H. Hender&s;on. Mr. John Lawrence. Mr. Morgan's &s;on. Stephen Davis, who lodged next door to Philips's. Mr. Ru|dolph. A Tobacconi&s;t's boy. Mr. I&s;aac Lloyd, all in the &s;ame neighbourhood, with &s;everal others who&s;e names I do not recollect, were all taken ill with a fever of a malignant kind within two or three days of each other.</P>
<P>The unu&s;ual number of deaths that occurred in the fir&s;t week of Augu&s;t, alarmed the Citizens and became a topic of general conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of a man who had worked on board the Ship Deborah, who died of a fever highly malig|nant the latter end of July, had been reported by Dr. Proudfit, but being a &s;olitary ca&s;e had excited but little apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the 5th, Achi&s;on Thomp&s;on's child was at|tacked with the fever.</P>
<P>The College of Phy&s;icians met on the 6th at which time about 26 ca&s;es of the fever were all that were known to exi&s;t in the city, and after conferring together they unanimou&s;ly agreed to the following re|&s;olutions,
<PB N="10" REF="033589_0011_0FF792660EDDB1D0">
which were immediately communicated to the Board of Health of Philadelphia.&mdash;<ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>"Re&s;olved that the college inform the Board of Health, that a malignant contageous fever has made its appearance in Water &s;treet, between Walnut and Spruce &s;treets, and in the vicinity thereof: And That the college recommend to the Board of Health to procure the removal of all the families that are &s;ituated between Walnut and Spruce &s;treets, and the Ea&s;t &s;ide of Front and the River, and to have all the Shipping lying between Walnut and Spruce &s;treets removed to a proper di&s;tance from the City."</P>

<P>"THE ACADEMY OF MEDICINE of Philadelphia, having taken into con&s;ideration the exi&s;tence of a Malignant Bilious Fever in the city, have conceived
<PB N="12" REF="033589_0013_0FF7926C774D0B20">
it to be their duty to lay before the Managers of the Marine and City Ho&s;pitals, the following facts re&s;pecting its origin, and the means of checking its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>We have upon inquiry di&s;covered that a ca&s;e of this fever exi&s;ted in the city on the 6th of June, and that &s;everal ca&s;es of it exi&s;ted in July, in parts of the city remote from the river, and wholly un|connected with each other. They appeared to originate from the putrid exhalations of alleys and gutters, and docks, and from the &s;tagnating water in the neighbourhood of the city. We derive the late rapid increa&s;e of the fever from the foul air of &s;everal &s;hips lately arrived in the port, and from &s;ome damaged coffee which arrived in a brig from Jamaica on the 29 July. In the cour&s;e of our in|quiries into the origin of the fever, we did not meet with a &s;ingle fact that could &s;upport the opi|nion of contagion being imported in the bodies or cloaths of &s;ick people in the &s;hips or ve&s;&s;els which lie between Walnut and Spruce &s;treets, where the di&s;ea&s;e has prevailed mo&s;t. Many re&s;pectable mo|dern authorities a&s;&s;ert that the yellow fever is <HI>not contagious</HI> in the We&s;t-Indies, and repeated ob&s;erva|tions &s;atisfy us that it is rarely &s;o, during the <HI>warm weather</HI> in the United States. None of the ca&s;es we have as yet &s;een have propagated it, and we conceive it to be an error as ab&s;urd in its nature as it has been fatal in its operation upon the city of Philadelphia, that the contagion of a di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould adhere to the timber of a &s;hip after a &s;ea voyage, and &s;hould &s;pread from the timber of the &s;hip with|out contact through an exten&s;ive neighbourhood, and cea&s;e to communicate it&s;elf afterwards by long and clo&s;e connection of the &s;ick with their fami|lies and attendants. We lament that this fact, to|gether with many others, upon the nature and ori|gin
<PB N="13" REF="033589_0014_0FF7926E0D7A41A0">
of the yellow fever, which were &s;tated in our letter to the Governor on the 1&s;t of December, 1797, and by him laid before the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate, have been treated with total neglect in the pre&s;ent health law: the di&s;tre&s;s we felt upon &s;eeing that law is, however, much alleviated by the re|flection that we have not contributed, in any de|gree, by &s;upporting an erroneous opinion, to repro|duce the pre&s;ent alarming calamity of our city.</P>
<P>We beg leave to recommend for the purpo&s;e of checking the progre&s;s of the fever, an attention to the following directions:</P>
<P>1&s;t. The removal of all the families from tho&s;e parts of the city where the di&s;ea&s;e, from the con|tamination of the atmo&s;phere, appears chiefly to exi&s;t, and the preventing tho&s;e parts being vi&s;ited by the citizens.</P>
<P>2dly. The removal of all &s;hips and putrid articles of commerce from the wharves and &s;tores of the city.</P>
<P>3dly. The cleaning of the docks, wharves, yards and cellars; al&s;o the wa&s;hing of the gutters every day, and of the &s;treets and alleys three times a week, by means of pumps and fire engines.</P>
<P>4thly. The appointment of a &s;ufficient number of phy&s;icians to take care of &s;uch of the poor as may be affected with the fever.</P>
<P>5thly. Publicly to advi&s;e the citizens to avoid all the u&s;ual exciting cau&s;es of fever, &s;uch as intem|perance, fatigue, exce&s;&s;ive heat, the night air, all violent and debilitating pa&s;&s;ions of the mind.</P>
<P>6thly. To advi&s;e them, in every ca&s;e of indi&s;po|&s;ition, however &s;light in appearance, to apply im|mediately for medical aid.</P>

<P>I AM &s;orry to di&s;cover by your letter, your want of &s;ucce&s;s in the treatment of our malignant fever at the City Ho&s;pital. I do not wonder at it. You &s;eldom &s;ee the di&s;ea&s;e in its fir&s;t &s;tage, and when you do, you meet it in an aggravated &s;tate by the motion your patients undergo in being conveyed to the Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to your reque&s;t, I have &s;at down to in|form you of the practice which I have adopted in our pre&s;ent epidemic. In the treatment of the yel|low fever of la&s;t year, I have occa&s;ionally lamented the lo&s;s of patients after reducing the pul&s;e by bleed|ing, and by the liberal u&s;e of purging medicines. I have &s;u&s;pected that death occurred in tho&s;e ca&s;es, from the &s;tagnation of acrid bile in the gall bladder, or its clo&s;e adherence to the upper bowels in the manner de&s;cribed by Doctor Mitchell in his account of the yellow fever in Virginia, in the year 1741. The &s;low pul&s;e which occurs about the 4th day, I &s;u&s;pect further to be the effect of this bile. Its ef|fects in a much more morbid &s;tate in the Jaundice,
<PB N="21" REF="033589_0022_0FF792826BBCF9C8">
in reducing the pul&s;e, is well known. Mr. John Hunter &s;ays he once met with an in&s;tance in which it fell to 32 &s;trokes in a minute in that di&s;ea&s;e. Re|volving the&s;e facts in my mind, I re&s;olved to try to remove this bile by exciting an artificial cholera morbus, about the 4th day of the fever. I was the more di&s;po&s;ed to attempt this method of cure, from believing, as I have done for &s;everal years, that a cholera morbus is nothing but the fir&s;t grade of bili|ous fever thrown in upon the bowels, ju&s;t as the Dy&s;entery and Diarrhoea are the internal forms of a common bilious or intermitting fever.</P>
<P>I began this mode of treating the fever eight days ago. My &s;olicitude for the i&s;&s;ue of it was very great. Thank God it has &s;ucceeded to my wi&s;hes, and thereby le&s;&s;ened in a great degree, the anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s which accompany our attendance upon this ferocious di&s;ea&s;e. The medicines I u&s;e for <HI>&s;ha|king</HI> the gall-bladder and bowels and <HI>di&s;charging</HI> the contents are, tartar emetic, gamboge, jalap and ca|lomel, combined, or given &s;eparately, and in &s;mall or large do&s;es, according to circum&s;tances. Perhaps Turpeth Mineral might be added to this li&s;t of vo|miting and purging medicines with advantage. In one ca&s;e I gave four grains of tartar emetic, and twenty of calomel. It operated freely upwards and downwards, and brought away a large quantity of green and black bile, but without exciting the lea&s;t cramp or pain in the &s;tomach or bowels. At the time I gave it, death appeared to be creeping upon my patient. The next day he was out of danger. The per&s;on thus re&s;cued from the grave, was a &s;on of Mr. Richard Ren&s;haw. Indeed I have not, as yet, lo&s;t a &s;ingle patient to whom I have given this powerful remedy. In one in&s;tance I fear it will fail. It is in a boy of 16 years of age, to whom I have gi|ven near thirty grains of tartar emetic in the cour&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="033589_0023_0FF792840E1963E8">
of a few hours without producing the lea&s;t evacuati|on from his &s;tomach or bowels. I have ob&s;erved the &s;ame encrea&s;e of &s;trength after its operation, that we ob&s;erve after bleeding and purging in the begin|ning of the fever.</P>
<P>Vomits are old remedies in the yellow fever of the We&s;t-Indies. I gave them on the fir&s;t day of the di&s;ea&s;e in the year 1793, and always without &s;ucce&s;s. They uniformly did harm when given in the begin|ning of the fever in its wor&s;t grade, in 1797. The rea&s;on of this failure in their efficacy, I now perceive was becau&s;e they were given <HI>before</HI> the violent mor|bid action in the &s;y&s;tem, was reduced or moderated by bleeding and purging. After this change is in|duced in the di&s;ea&s;e, they are perfectly &s;afe. The time for exhibiting them &s;hould be regulated by the pul&s;e, and other &s;ymptoms. In moderate ca&s;es of the fever, they are as proper in its fir&s;t &s;tage, as on the 4th day. As there is a bli&s;tering point in all fe|vers, &s;o there appears to be an <HI>emetic point</HI> in the yel|low fever It may occur on the &s;econd, and it may be protracted to the &s;ixth or &s;eventh day of the di&s;ea&s;e. I have not given the medicines I have mentioned in any ca&s;e where the patient complained of pain or burning in the &s;tomach, but I have con&s;idered a nau|&s;ea, and a moderate degree of puking as no ob&s;tacle to it's u&s;e, for Dr. Phy&s;ick has taught me by his di&s;|&s;ections, that the&s;e &s;ymptoms may exi&s;t without the lea&s;t inflammation in the &s;tomach, and that they have been ab&s;ent where the &s;tomach has appeared after death to have been highly inflamed.</P>
<P>The cure of the fever &s;hould not re&s;t upon a &s;ingle do&s;e of the medicine. I have given two do&s;es of it in a day in &s;everal ca&s;es, and have given it in one ca&s;e every day for three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days.</P>
<P>It has often been remarked, that no two epidemics are exactly alike. They vary not only in different
<PB N="23" REF="033589_0024_0FF7928979188808">
climates, but in the &s;ame climate in different years. They even vary with the changes of the weather in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on. The fever of 1797 differed in &s;e|veral particulars from the fever of 1793, and the pre&s;ent epidemic differs materially from both. In many of the ca&s;es I have &s;een, it exceeds the fever of la&s;t year in its malignity. The&s;e variations in di&s;|ea&s;es call for corre&s;ponding changes in our practice.</P>
<P>I have communicated an account of the <HI>time</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of di&s;charging the contents of the gall-blad|der and bowels to &s;everal of our brethren. I ardent|ly hope it may be univer&s;ally &s;ucce&s;sful in their hands.</P>
<P>If any thing new occurs in your practice in the Ho&s;pital, do me the favor of informing me of it.</P>
<P>With be&s;t wi&s;hes for your health and &s;ucce&s;s in your pre&s;ent arduous &s;ituation, I am your &s;incere friend,</P>

<P>SINCE my la&s;t report, which was on the 15th in&s;tant, I have been engaged in attending three per|&s;ons, with the malignant fever, out of town, the in|fection of which they appear to have received pre|vious to their leaving it. Since my return to town, I find the woman who nur&s;ed Mr. Dougla&s;s's &s;on has been affected with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, though &s;he was &s;alivated from rubbing him with mercurial ointment, and mu&s;t have received it from him by contagion,
<PB N="27" REF="033589_0028_0FF7929250E89918">
as &s;he had never been out of the hou&s;e for &s;ix days previous to the attack.</P>
<P>I al&s;o know two per&s;ons that have taken the di&s;|ea&s;e this year who had it la&s;t year. A young man at the corner of Second and Lombard &s;treets, who lived in the family of Mr. Cockburn, at the corner of Spruce and Front &s;treets, (who with his wife and a boy lately died in the &s;ame hou&s;e of the exi&s;ting fe|ver) and his brother is now in the di&s;ea&s;e. There are at this time 10 or 12 per&s;ons with it in the Alleys near Mr. Hunter's, the druggi&s;t, in Second-&s;treet. Dr. Pa&s;chalis has had five applications &s;ince la&s;t even|ing; one, a French jeweller in Second near Che&s;nut &s;treet, Mr. Valence and &s;i&s;ter in Spruce-&s;treet, &amp;c. Dr. Church is attending two fre&s;h ca&s;es in the fami|ly of Mrs. Roberts, in Chri&s;tian-&s;treet. You need not be reminded of the ca&s;es in Race and Vine &s;treets, and in Ken&s;ington. In &s;hort, the di&s;ea&s;e is rapidly and &s;en&s;ibly &s;preading into every part of the city, and can no longer be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed till fro&s;t arrives to di&s;arm it of its power. If this be the ca&s;e, (and that it is, pa&s;t events demon&s;trate) would it not be advi&s;a|ble (I mean not to dictate but merely to enquire, from motives of pure and, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, di&s;intere&s;ted humanity) to apprize the citizens which &s;till remain in town, of their danger, and to furni&s;h them with in&s;tructions how to e&s;cape its de&s;tructive ravages?</P>
<P>Advice from you, in your collective capacity, would have the virtue of a law, and would be prompt|ly obeyed.

<HEAD>From the Philadelphia Gazette, of this date.</HEAD>
<P>The pre&s;ent alarming &s;ituation of our city, is alas, truly deplorable&mdash;almo&s;t in a general &s;tate of infecti|on with the di&s;ea&s;e, to who&s;e virulence, medicinal &s;kill is lamentably compelled, to acknowledge its in|feriority! Former experience is rendered in a great mea&s;ure u&s;ele&s;s by the very material difference in the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;The mo&s;t copious bleed|ing, and the mo&s;t violent purgatives have been found ineffectual; and the &s;ucce&s;s that will attend the new &s;y&s;tem of emptying the gall-bladder, is at lea&s;t pro|blematical. With regard to the opinion of the non-contagion of the di&s;order, I have very great rea&s;on to doubt it. I have known, lately, &s;everal in&s;tances that could not be accounted for upon any other prin|ciple than that of contagion. The mo&s;t &s;triking of the ca&s;es I allude to, is, where &s;everal of a family, living in a healthy and uninfected part of the city, took the di&s;order from a per&s;on in the family, whom they had for &s;everal days clo&s;ely attended; without having them&s;elves been in any part of the city that could even have been &s;uppo&s;ed to be infected. I would caution my fellow-citizens not to tru&s;t too implicitly to this fatal opinion, which has been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated. A confidence in it, in ca&s;e it &s;hould happen to be erroneous, may prove the de|&s;truction of thou&s;ands, while by acting under a di&s;be|lief
<PB N="29" REF="033589_0030_0FF792968986F700">
of it, and u&s;ing every po&s;&s;ible precaution, as many lives may be pre&s;erved. It is at lea&s;t doubt|ful whether it is or is not contagious, and there being a doubt, I think the wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e to be pur&s;ued is obvious. I would advi&s;e my friends to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the night air or morning fogs, nothing tending more effectu|ally to predi&s;po&s;e the body to infection.</P>
<P>Temperate living both in eating and drinking is of as much con&s;equence. Any thing that enriches the blood&mdash;any thing that has the &s;malle&s;t tendency to inflammation is mo&s;t carefully to be avoided. I &s;peak this, my fellow-citizens, with confidence. Both in '93 and '97 I knew many in&s;tances, where people &s;ituated in the very bed of infection, by living with extraordinary temperance, e&s;caped. The idea entertained by many per&s;ons, that generous living, or in other words, high &s;ea&s;oned food, and a gla&s;s of good Madeira, from the be&s;t and mo&s;t effectual bul|wark, is too prepo&s;terous and ab&s;urd to merit much comment. Con&s;tant experience and the plaine&s;t principles of common &s;en&s;e flatly contradict it. Sim|ple and at the &s;ame time, nouri&s;hing food, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of vegetables and ripe fruits, avoiding meats as much as po&s;&s;ible, and never u&s;ing any but in their &s;imple&s;t &s;tate, I would &s;trongly recommend. Vio|lent exerci&s;e, by heating the blood, &s;eldom fails to be &s;ucceeded by a violent attack of the di&s;order, and is therefore to be guarded again&s;t. I &s;hall conclude my ob&s;ervations, by remarking that cooling drinks prepared with cream of tartar, tamarinds, lemons, currant jelly, or any kinds of acid fruits, are highly proper both as preventatives and remedies; and that nothing has a better or more powerful effect in pre|venting putrid appearances than a con&s;tant and un|remitting u&s;e of acids.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. FENNO,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is an ob&s;ervation founded in truth, that few if any people in the world, have gone further in works of philanthrophy than the citizens of Philadelphia. Let him who di&s;credits it, take an impartial &s;urvey of the various in&s;titutions erected in this city, for the re|lief of &s;uffering humanity, many of which are &s;uppor|ted by the voluntary contributions of benevolent in|dividuals, and his doubts &s;hall vani&s;h&mdash;Yet &s;ome further regulations appear to be indi&s;pen&s;able&mdash;there are per&s;ons for whom, either the laws have made no provi&s;ion, or to who&s;e pitiable condition the hand of mercy, under the laws, has not been extended.</P>
<P>It is but recently that a poor wretch was &s;uffered to lie and peri&s;h in one of the &s;treets in the Northern Liberties, without the lea&s;t kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance having been afforded him: whether the police officers are ju&s;tly cen&s;urable for a neglect of duty, or otherwi&s;e, is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire; the fact is, however, certain. Had his ca&s;e been duly attended to, this haple&s;s &s;on of mi&s;ery might, perhaps, have been re&s;|cued from an untimely grave.</P>
<P>In the Penn&s;ylvania Ho&s;pital, a per&s;on cannot be admitted, but under certain qualifications; but this in&s;titution is liberal in its principles, and in its prac|tice. It is a point of prudence, and perhaps of nece&s;&s;i|ty, not to receive into the alms-hou&s;e, any per&s;on having a contagious di&s;order, it is not knowingly done&mdash;and, unle&s;s the object be afflicted with the prevailing malady, or &s;u&s;pected to be &s;o, he cannot procure an entrance into the City Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>A few days &s;ince a circum&s;tance occurred which was truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing&mdash;A German, a &s;tranger in the place, applied to be admitted into the Penn&s;ylvania <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his ca&s;e did not come &s;trictly within their
<PB N="31" REF="033589_0032_0FF7929B54EC4708">
cognizance, and he was refu&s;ed. He then &s;olicited an entrance into the alms-hou&s;e, but having the dy|&s;entery, and not being entitled to a place of re&s;idence here, he was un&s;ucce&s;sful. His next application was to captain Allen, health-officer of the port, but the captain conceiving him&s;elf unauthorized to &s;end him to the City Ho&s;pital, the poor wretch was turned away without any hope of relief. What became of him I know not, but the deep di&s;tre&s;s, anxiety, and de&s;pondency depicted in his countenance produced a corre&s;pondent &s;entiment of &s;ympathy in the minds of the by&s;tanders, all of whom &s;eemed to regret his un|happy condition, though none knew in what manner to grant him the aid he required.</P>
<P>Let us but recall the ca&s;e of this unfortunate man home to our own bo&s;oms&mdash;di&s;ea&s;ed, friendle&s;s and di&s;con&s;olate&mdash;&s;ituate in a &s;trange country, where he knew not the countenance of a &s;ingle human being; incapable of providing for him&s;elf, and unable from illne&s;s to leave the city; willing to take refuge even in an infected ho&s;pital, and I am &s;ure there is no man who is not ab&s;olutely callous to the voice of mi&s;ery, and dead to every thing which bears the &s;tamp of humanity, who will not approve of &s;ome plan being fallen on for the comfortable accommodation of &s;uch of his &s;uffering fellow-men&mdash;A plan for this laudable purpo&s;e is not only very fea&s;ible, but of ve|ry ea&s;y practicability. I would advi&s;e then, that a temporary building be immediately erected near the City Ho&s;pital, into which all di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons, willing to go, &s;hould be freely and without ceremony ad|mitted. If, on experiment, they are found to have the prevailing malady, they &s;hould be placed in the ho&s;pital; if otherwi&s;e, they &s;hould be provided for as circum&s;tances would render humane and proper. But, as a more permanent and effectual e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, there &s;hould be attached to the in&s;titution of
<PB N="32" REF="033589_0033_0FF7929F0EBAC850">
the alms-hou&s;e, not directly joining it, an infirmary, into which all per&s;ons de&s;igned to be accommodated in the in&s;titution, &s;hould at fir&s;t be &s;ent there to un|dergo an examination of judicious phy&s;icians, and afterwards either to be provided for in the infirma|ry, or to be otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of, as their &s;everal ca&s;es might require. Surely there can be no rea&s;on|able objection to a plan of this kind&mdash;the expence would be trifling, compared with the magnitude of the object, and the good which might re&s;ult from it, would be incalculable. The man who will &s;et about accompli&s;hing this object, mu&s;t &s;ucceed&mdash;and will doubtle&s;s have, not only the ine&s;timable enjoyment of an approving mind, but the ble&s;&s;ing of many a woe-worn object of wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>If public in&s;titutions will not &s;helter under their roofs, di&s;ea&s;ed and penny-le&s;s wretches, can it, or ought it to be expected, that private per&s;ons will? And e&s;pecially at a time, when the horror attached to the idea of introducing the yellow fever into their families, produces, in the minds of mo&s;t, a &s;pecies of morbid panic, which paralizes every &s;entiment of ho&s;pitality towards &s;u&s;pected individuals.</P>
<P>I am not &s;o tenacious of my plan but that I will mo&s;t cordially &s;upport a better, if one more eligible is propo&s;ed by a more happy genius: but this is no time for tempori&s;ing, or halting between two opini|ons; &s;omething mu&s;t be promptly done; and I now call on my fellow-citizens, in the name of every thing dear to humanity, not to he&s;itate, or trifle on the occa&s;ion. To the guardians of the poor, and the managers of the marine and city ho&s;pitals, I make the appeal, and tru&s;t it will not be in vain&mdash;They have the power and the means of accompli&s;h|ing the object; they are men; they mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of a fellow-feeling for the unfortunate, and mu&s;t be convinced of the urgency of the occa&s;ion.

<HEAD>FEVER AT PORTSMOUTH. (N. H.)</HEAD>
<P>In con&s;equence of the prevalence of a fever in that town, a health committee has been appointed. The following is extracted from their fir&s;t official report:</P>
<P>"That from the fir&s;t appearance of the fever, which was about the 20th July, to 20th Augu&s;t, in|clu&s;ive, 11 per&s;ons have died of that di&s;order, and no one &s;ince Monday la&s;t.</P>

<P>On the 24th in&s;t. the returns of &s;ick in Bo&s;ton were 23&mdash;and 9 convale&s;cents. On the 20th there were only 20 &s;ick in that place.</P>
<P>Mr. Davis, who retired to Norri&s;ton to e&s;cape the fever, died on the 24th, being the &s;ixth day from the attack. Had been repeatedly bled and purged with mercury by Dr. H. for the fir&s;t three days&mdash;

<P>Official accounts from Bo&s;ton &s;tate, that the fever there is on the decline.</P>
<P>A writer in the New-York Commercial Adver|ti&s;er advi&s;es the inhabitants not to let another year pa&s;s away without the introduction of &s;treams of wa|ter into that city, and adds&mdash;"Your fellow-citizens are now flying into the country, and perhaps the &s;cenes of 1795 are to be acted over again."</P>
<P>Received information to-day from Mr. Tarrill, that captain Chace, who lodged with him at Mel|drum's Inn, at the &s;ign of the O&s;trich, in the North|ern Liberties, went on board a ve&s;&s;el from Portland, about the 10th or 12th in&s;t. which lay at Shoema|ker's wharf near Vine-&s;treet, to &s;ee captain Wait, who&s;e mate was at the time very ill on board, and that captain Chace was taken ill a few days after his vi&s;it, and died.</P>

<P>Dr. Cooper, one of the re&s;ident phy&s;icians of the City Ho&s;pital, and Dr. Sayre, appointed to attend the poor of the Northern Liberties, are both very ill to-day, though pronounced in the public papers of ye&s;terday to be on the recovery.</P>
<P>Dr. Cooper appears to have received the di&s;ea&s;e by contagion, in the Ho&s;pital, as he had not been in any other part of the city for more than three weeks before his attack.</P>
<P>The following pathetic addre&s;s was publi&s;hed in the Philadelphia Gazette of to-day, by the Managers the Marine and City Ho&s;pitals:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Health-Office,</HI> <DATE><HI>September</HI> 1, 1798.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IMPELLED by the awful progre&s;s and unparal|leled malignity of the prevailing fever, we are con|&s;trained to addre&s;s your feelings, as well as your rea|&s;on, in order to avert the fatal de&s;truction which, with rapid &s;trides, is pervading our ill-fated city and &s;uburbs.</P>
<P>The be&s;t &s;kill of our phy&s;icians, and all the pow|ers of medicine, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, have pro|ved unequal in the conte&s;t with this devouring poi|&s;on.</P>
<P>With the mo&s;t affecting &s;ympathy and anxious &s;o|licitude, we have to the be&s;t of our judgments, en|deavoured to employ, as circum&s;tances appeared to require, the power and the means entru&s;ted to us, in arre&s;ting its progre&s;s, and alleviating its concommi|tant mi&s;eries. We &s;hall continue to employ them with unremitting zeal; but we have neither the pow|er
<PB N="44" REF="033589_0045_0FF792C8F58059A0">
nor the means to accompli&s;h ALL THE MEASURES nece&s;&s;ary to check its exten&s;ion, or provide for the pre&s;&s;ing exigencies of the moment. The powers delegated, and appropriations made by law, to the in&s;titutions under our direction, are impotent indeed, when compared to the magnitude of the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It remains for our fellow-citizens to attain, by their energy, the ends which alone can &s;top its progre&s;s and dimini&s;h its horrors.</P>
<P>We have, in conjunction with the Guardians of the Poor, cau&s;ed tents to be erected on the ea&s;t bank of the Schuylkill for the accommodation of the indi|gent; where near twelve hundred are already pro|vided for, out of the fund appropriated for the or|dinary relief of the poor. This is but a partial mi|tigation of the evils which environ thou&s;ands who have a claim upon the philanthropy of tho&s;e who are in more fortunate circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The difficulty of procuring a place of refuge, at pre&s;ent, in the country, is too well known; and the expen&s;e attending the removal of a family has di&s;|couraged many from the attempt, who are in cir|cu&s;tances to live comfortably at home.</P>
<P>What remains to be done? Citizens of re&s;pecta|bility and influence! come forward and form your|&s;elves into a committee for the purpo&s;e of erecting on the we&s;t bank of the Schuylkill, all the tents that can be collected; let the tents be floored with boards, and made as comfortable as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;If tents cannot be had, boards in abundance may be procur|ed for the erection of &s;heds. Admoni&s;h tho&s;e citi|zens who have no place of refuge, to take &s;helter there, particularly tho&s;e from the ea&s;t part of the city, the di&s;trict of Southwark, and the Northern Liber|ties&mdash;in &s;hort, ALL who can leave their homes without manife&s;t injury; except tho&s;e who are ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the protection of the city and liberties.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="033589_0046_0FF792CAC61C58A8">
The committee &s;hould have the general &s;uperin|tendance and regulation of the tents, and authority to pre&s;erve order; contract for certain &s;upplies of bread, meat, vegetables, wood, &amp;c. at the lowe&s;t po&s;&s;ible rates. Tho&s;e who are not in circum&s;tances to pay, mu&s;t be &s;upplied by the public bounty.</P>
<P>It is at lea&s;t an unequal, perhaps an unju&s;t mode of rai&s;ing money by an appeal to the humanity of generous individuals; but if on any occa&s;ion it may be ju&s;tified, the pre&s;ent may be a&s;&s;umed without he|&s;itation.</P>
<P>We call your attention to the actual and undi&s;|gui&s;ed &s;tate of our city. Con&s;ider the mortality and rapid increa&s;e of the &s;ick at &s;o early a period. View the li&s;t of your phy&s;icians, and <HI>mark how few are at their po&s;ts</HI>&mdash;and we believe you will think with us, that the pre&s;ervation of health is only to be attained by flight.</P>
<P>Do not flatter your&s;elves, fellow-citizens, that this picture is too highly coloured; we &s;peak from con|viction, and a knowledge of facts; and doubt not but that the lives of hundreds, perhaps of thou&s;ands, may be pre&s;erved by the adoption of the&s;e or &s;imilar mea&s;ures.</P>

fever in Wilmington, and he caught it in the city early in Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>The following medical advice, addre&s;&s;ed to the citizens of Philadelphia, by Doctors Ru&s;h and Grif|fitts, was publi&s;hed in the Philadelphia Gazette of the 4th in&s;tant:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>MEDICAL ADVICE TO THE CITIZENS OF PHILADELPHIA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The following directions for the prevention and treat|ment of the prevailing fever, are affectionately recom|mended to tho&s;e citizens of Philadelphia, who are una|ble to procure the regular attendance and advice of phy&s;icians, by</HI> BENJAMIN RUSH, SAMUEL P. GRIFFITTS. September 3d, 1798.</P>
<P>THE &s;eeds of the di&s;ea&s;e may exi&s;t in the body, for a con&s;iderable time, without doing any harm. It is generally EXCITED by one or more of the follow|ing cau&s;es, which of cour&s;e ought to be carefully avoided, <ABBR>viz:</ABBR> fatigue, a long walk, &s;tanding in the &s;un, or in a current of air, intemperance in eating and drinking, co&s;tivene&s;s, violent pa&s;&s;ions, or &s;udden emotions of the mind, thin dre&s;&s;ed, light bed cloathes, and above all, the night air.</P>
<P>It is of con&s;equence for our citizens to know that we have but one fever in our city at pre&s;ent, and that every febrile indi&s;po&s;ition partakes of the prevail|ing malignant epidemic. Hundreds have died from mi&s;taking the fir&s;t &s;tage of the fever for a common cold. The mi&s;take is a natural one, for it comes on like a cold, and is frequently excited by cool, or cold air. This remark is intended to produce ap|plications for medical aid as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after
<PB N="48" REF="033589_0049_0FF792D35BE20FC0">
feeling the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of indi&s;po&s;ition at the pre|&s;ent juncture.</P>
<P>In the forming &s;tate of the fever when the patient feels &s;lightly indi&s;po&s;ed, and before he is confined to his bed, the following remedies generally check the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A purge of &s;alts, ca&s;tor oil, or a do&s;e of jalap and calomel. If the&s;e fail of giving relief, a gentle &s;weat &s;hould be excited in the u&s;ual way. If there be much pain in the head or back, and the pul&s;e be full, or ten&s;e, ten or twelve ounces of blood &s;hould be lo&s;t, before the u&s;e of the &s;weat, and either before or af|ter taking the purge. Entire re&s;t from bu&s;ine&s;s and exerci&s;e of all kinds will be nece&s;&s;ary to give effica|cy to the above remedies.</P>
<P>If the exi&s;tence of the di&s;ea&s;e were more early, and more generally admitted, and the remedies which have been recommended, u&s;ed before the fever was completely formed, there are the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons to believe there would be much le&s;s mortality from it.</P>
<P>After the di&s;ea&s;e is formed, and appears with more or le&s;s of the following &s;ymptoms, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> chills, great heat, head-ache, a redne&s;s in the eyes, &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, vomiting, pains in the back, limbs and bowels, &amp;c. the following remedies are proper:</P>
<P N="1">1. The lo&s;s of ten or twelve ounces of blood two or three times a day while the pul&s;e continues to be FULL, or TENSE.&mdash;If the pul&s;e &s;hould be SLOWER, and APPARENTLY WEAKER than natural, it calls for bleeding as much as it does when it di&s;covers pre|ternatural fulne&s;s and ten&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. The bowels &s;hould be purged at the &s;ame time with calomel mixed with jalap or rhubarb in pow|ders or in pills.&mdash;The operation of this purging me|dicine &s;hould be aided, when practicable, by cly&s;ters compo&s;ed of half an ounce of glauber &s;alts di&s;&s;olved
<PB N="49" REF="033589_0050_0FF792D942A85410">
in half a pint of warm water with &s;weet oil, mola&s;&s;es, and common &s;alt of each a table &s;poonful, in it.</P>
<P>The bowels &s;hould be kept gently open through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, by means of the above cly&s;ters, and any other gently purging medi|cine.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the &s;tomach &s;hould be &s;ick and oppre&s;&s;ed with bile, a vomit of ipecacuhana, or tartar emetic may be given at any time on the 3d or 4th day of the di&s;ea&s;e, provided the pul&s;e has been reduced by previous bleeding and purging. From five to ten drops of laudanum may be given to compo&s;e the &s;to|mach if the vomit &s;hould operate more than three or four times.</P>
<P N="4">4. Calomel &s;hould be given from the beginning, in do&s;es of from two to five grains, every two hours, in order to excite a &s;alivation. If the calomel &s;hould purge more than two or three times a day, four or five drops of laudanum may be given two or three times a day, in order to confine the calomel to the bowels, and thereby to determine it to the mouth and throat. We have &s;een no death where this me|dicine has produced a &s;alivation.</P>
<P N="5">5. After the pul&s;e is reduced by bleeding and purging if the di&s;ea&s;e has not yielded, a profu&s;e &s;weat &s;hould be excited by wrapping the patient up in blankets, with five or &s;ix hot bricks wetted with vinegar applied to different parts of his body, and gi|ving him at the &s;ame time large and repeated draughts during twenty four hours of HOT camomile or &s;age tea, HOT lemonade or weak punch, or any other HOT liquor that is agreeable to him, to drink. This &s;weat &s;hould be continued for twenty-four hours, 'till the patient is out of danger.</P>
<P N="6">6. Bli&s;ters &s;hould be applied to the wri&s;ts and an|kles, in common ca&s;es, about the third or fourth day of the fever, if the pul&s;e be reduced, or the &s;ickne&s;s
<PB N="50" REF="033589_0051_0FF792DBE4DEE760">
at &s;tomach is trouble&s;ome. If the head be much af|fected, a bli&s;ter &s;hould be applied to the neck or to the crown of the head, fir&s;t cutting off the hair and &s;having it, and if the &s;tomach &s;hould be much af|fected after the third or fourth day a large bli&s;ter &s;hould be applied to it.</P>
<P N="7">7. In ca&s;e of delirium with a languid pul&s;e, poul|tices of raw garlic with a little mu&s;tard &s;hould be applied to the feet.</P>
<P N="8">8. Fre&s;h air &s;hould be admitted into &s;ick rooms at all times, and cool air in the beginning of the fe|ver when the &s;kin is hot, and the pul&s;e full and ten&s;e. In this &s;tate of the fever, the hands, feet and face &s;hould be wa&s;hed ten or twelve times a day with cold water. In a cool &s;tate of the &s;kin, or when the body is covered with &s;weat, cool air and cold water are improper.</P>
<P N="9">9. The body and bed linen of the &s;ick &s;hould be frequently changed, and all offen&s;ive matters di&s;|charged from them, &s;hould be in&s;tantly removed.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es of great weakne&s;s, the patient &s;hould not be permitted to ri&s;e from his bed when under the operation of purging phy&s;ick nor upon any other oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P N="10">10. The drinks of &s;ick people in the beginning of the fever, &s;hould be toa&s;t and water, tamarind water, lemonade, currant jelly di&s;&s;olved in water, apple wa|ter or barley water. In the latter &s;tage of the fever, the drink may be porter and water, claret and wa|ter, milk and water, or comomile tea.</P>
<P>Weak tea and coffee may be taken in the begin|ning of the fever. In its &s;econd &s;tage the patient may eat bread and milk with roa&s;ted apples or &s;oft peaches, chocolate, &s;ago, tapioca, ripe fruits, weak chicken or veal broth, and a little boiled chicken.</P>
<P>It will be improper to depend exclu&s;ively upon any one of the above remedies. The combined
<PB N="51" REF="033589_0052_0FF792DD75B7BD50">
force of them all is barely &s;ufficient in many ca&s;es to overcome this formidable di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>P. S. All the above medicines with &s;uitable di|rections may be had of George Hunter, No. 114, South Second-&s;treet; John J. Malcolm, No.78, South Second-&s;treet; and Robert Stafford, No.36, Market-&s;treet.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The prevalence of the fever in New-York, ac|counted for, as follows, in the Philadelphia Gazette of the 4th in&s;tant, under the New-York head:</P>
<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>A VERY con&s;iderable alarm having taking place among the citizens, and the mo&s;t exaggerated re|ports circulated about the country, of the &s;ickne&s;s with which certain parts of the city are afflicted, we have thought it a duty to make &s;uch enquiries as might enable us to place the matter in a point of view, as near the truth as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>About the beginning of Augu&s;t, in con&s;equence of the foul, unfini&s;hed &s;tate of &s;everal water-lots, on the Ea&s;t river, between Co<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">nties and the Old-&s;lip, up|wards of 20 per&s;ons were attacked nearly about the &s;ame time, with what appeared to be <HI>common colds,</HI> &s;ome &s;lightly, others more &s;everely; but the general occurrence of the fact in that neighbourhood led to a belief that it aro&s;e from a <HI>local</HI> cau&s;e and threatened &s;omething more &s;erious. The foulne&s;s of the lots, and e&s;pecially two vacant ones, being receptacles of every kind of filth, was con&s;idered as <HI>that cau&s;e;</HI> and in pur&s;uance of official arrangements, they were im|mediately covered with whole&s;ome &s;and: The effect was, a general re&s;toration of the &s;ick.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of the New-&s;lip, where the buildings for the mo&s;t part, are &s;mall, and many of them inhabited by poor people, who live in a croud|ed manner, and in &s;ituations incapable of proper ven|tilation,
<PB N="52" REF="033589_0053_0FF792DF5D370CB8">
di&s;ea&s;es occurred about the 12th&mdash;a number of per&s;ons died&mdash;but at pre&s;ent there appears to be no great cau&s;e of alarm in that quarter.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame period, or a little later, two or three per&s;ons were &s;eized at Bruce's wharf with &s;u&s;|picious &s;ymptoms, and &s;ome deaths have taken place there and in its vicinity, owing, it is generally thought, to the extremely foul condition of Bruce and Mar&s;ton's unfilled lots, bounding on the Ea&s;t|river, at the foot of Pine-&s;treet&mdash;the effluvia i&s;&s;uing from them being highly putrid and offen&s;ive. Mea|&s;ures have been taken, and are now in operation, to cover them with whole&s;ome earth, by which means it is hoped the evil in that quarter, if it has ari&s;en from this &s;ource, may be corrected.</P>
<P>About the 20th, &s;everal per&s;ons were &s;eized in Cliff-&s;treet, nearly in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e be|tween Coenties and the Old-&s;lip. At fir&s;t they ge|nerally con&s;idered their complaints to be mere colds taken by &s;leeping with open windows in the vio|lently hot weather which then prevailed&mdash;Unfortu|nately, it was a more &s;erious ca&s;e. The patients ra|pidly grew wor&s;e, and &s;everal died as well there as in John, Gold and Rider-&s;treets, and Eden's-Allies, all lying within the vicinity of Burling-&s;lip &s;ewer. The&s;e complaints, on inve&s;tigation, were thought to proceed, in part, from the offen&s;ive &s;tate of that &s;ew|er; which had, for &s;ome time, become a receptacle for various &s;pecies of putrid matter, and of which the mouth lies nearly oppo&s;ite John-&s;treet, commonly called Golden-hill-&s;treet&mdash;&s;o that, whenever a South or S. E. wind prevailed, it blew through the &s;ewer, and bore a column of effluvia up John-&s;treet, and through that into Cliff, and the adjacent &s;treets, ren|dering the atmo&s;phere intollerably bad. The be&s;t informed phy&s;icians are of this opinion. The head of the &s;ewer has &s;ince been clo&s;ed by a valve-door,
<PB N="53" REF="033589_0054_0FF792E228581C18">
and a con&s;iderable quantity of quick lime thrown into it, with a view of neutralizing its contents. A &s;imilar door, with the &s;ame intention, has been ad|ded to the Ferry-&s;treet &s;ewer.</P>
<P>Other cau&s;es are al&s;o alledged, and with great plau&s;ibility, at lea&s;t, if not certainty.</P>
<P>It is well known that the ce&s;&s;ation of our com|mercial intercour&s;e with the French I&s;lands, in con|&s;equence of their ho&s;tile violence, has greatly le&s;&s;on|ed the demand for provi&s;ions: of cour&s;e large quan|tities of beef remained in many cellars, particularly among the merchants of Pearl-&s;treet. Much of this, from what is now &s;een to be an improper mode of packing, as directed by a late law, has lately become tainted, emitted a very putrid effluvium&mdash;corrupting the air and contributing its &s;hare as a cau&s;e of di&s;|ea&s;e. We learn that the commi&s;&s;ioners of the health-office have taken mea&s;ures to have it all in&s;pected, and the &s;poiled removed out of town. Much al|ready has been &s;ent away, and the remainder is go|ing as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The&s;e cau&s;es, with the immen&s;e fall of rain, and violent heats, experienced in the cour&s;e of Au|gu&s;t, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have originated the di&s;ea&s;e which has &s;pread &s;uch panic as to drive many fami|lies into the country.</P>
<P>On the mo&s;t diligent enquiry however, we can|not find out, that any great &s;ubject of alarm exi&s;ts, except in the neighbourhood of the New-&s;lip&mdash;in the vicinity of Darling-&s;lip-&s;ewer&mdash;and at the foot of Pine-&s;treet, at which places &s;everal per&s;ons have died.</P>
<P>Individual ca&s;es have al&s;o occurred in other parts of the town, but, as in 1795, they remain in&s;u|lated, and without communication to the attendants, as far as we can di&s;cover. The&s;e, it is generally thought were taken at one or the other of the places before mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="033589_0055_0FF792E7D0E33248">
An opinion has been avowed by &s;ome, that the di&s;ea&s;e has been imported, or aro&s;e from damaged coffee, thrown out of a &s;hip on Kelley's dock, we&s;t of the New-&s;lip. This, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, is utterly groundle&s;s, and can &s;erve no purpo&s;e but that of delu&s;ion. The quantity of refu&s;e-coffee al|luded to by our advocates for imported contagion did not exceed half a peck, and was the mere &s;weep|ings of the hold.</P>
<P>We are informed by a gentleman who has been at the pains to collect a li&s;t of the per&s;ons interred in the &s;everal burial grounds, that during the la&s;t week, they averaged about 12 per day&mdash;and that previous to Sunday la&s;t, there was no very unu&s;ual mortality for the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to new ca&s;es, enquiry at the be&s;t &s;ources, enables us to &s;ay they have very much de|clined within the la&s;t 24 hours, and that the di&s;ea&s;e yields more readily to medicine.</P>
<P>How far this &s;tatement authorizes the extreme alarm which precipitates &s;o many citizens out of town, we do not know; but it would at lea&s;t be ad|vi&s;eable that all who remove &s;hould leave their hou|&s;es, cellars and yards in a cleanly condition&mdash;that &s;uch as remain may not be expo&s;ed to the bad ef|fects of their carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem of cleanline&s;s adopted by the com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the health-office, we are happy to ob|&s;erve, is pur&s;ued with increa&s;ed vigour; and indefa|tigable efforts are daily made by that board, to pre|clude every &s;ource of impure air in the city.</P>
<P>This &s;tatement may be depended on&mdash;it is the re&s;ult of enquiry of the fir&s;t authority.</P>

<P>This fever had not been ob&s;erved to exi&s;t in Phi|ladelphia for more than thirty years before the year '93&mdash;and has never been known to exi&s;t in the win|ter &s;ea&s;on in this climate; differing in this re&s;pect, from tho&s;e contagious fevers that are bred in jails, ho&s;pitals and pri&s;on &s;hips; but perfectly re&s;embling the plagues which have been introduced at different times into different maritime towns in Europe from certain parts of Africa, and the Turki&s;h dominions in Europe bordering upon A&s;ia.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances which render the contagion of the yellow fever active and favor its &s;preading or be|coming epidemic, appear to be, hot, rarified and &s;tagnant, or confined air, more e&s;pecially when re|plete and altered in its &s;alutary quality by putrid ex|halations from dead vegetable and animal &s;ub&s;tances. Under the recited circum&s;tances the majority of tho&s;e who approach very near to, or come in contact with the &s;ick, &s;o as to receive the exhalations emit|ted by the lungs or &s;kin, become in the cour&s;e of a few days, mo&s;t commonly on the fifth or &s;ixth day af|ter &s;uch expo&s;ure, affected with the &s;ame kind of fe|ver, but as all that approach within the &s;ame di&s;tance
<PB N="67" REF="033589_0068_0FF7930CA3033DD8">
to the &s;ick do not afterwards take the di&s;ea&s;e though they have received the contagious particles into their bodies, it implies that their con&s;titutions are not di&s;po&s;ed to favour its operation, that is, that they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a power to re&s;i&s;t its action or impre&s;&s;i|on, or that the contagion mixing with the fluids in the &s;tomach, or with tho&s;e in the arteries pa&s;&s;es out again, with &s;ome of the u&s;ual excretions.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances which, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, appear to give effect to the contagion, &s;o as to produce fe|ver, after it has been received into the circulation through the medium of the &s;tomach, lungs or &s;kin, appear to be &s;uch as have the power of inducing &s;ud|den and great debility in the &s;everal functions of the body, and con&s;equent &s;pa&s;m or con&s;triction of the extreme ve&s;&s;els, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Among the chief of the&s;e, may be reckoned, &s;ud|den expo&s;ure to cold, after great fatigue, or after be|ing greatly heated by exerci&s;e and expo&s;ure to the &s;corching rays of the &s;un.</P>
<P>Intemperance, &s;ucceeded by ab&s;tinence, frequent blood letting, purging, fa&s;ting, and con&s;tant terror or dread of the di&s;ea&s;e, have all a &s;imilar effect.&mdash;Whereas moderate and refre&s;hing exerci&s;e, the tem|perate u&s;e of &s;uch nouri&s;hing food as has no tenden|cy to &s;timulate or inflame, and rather to pre&s;erve the bowels laxative than otherwi&s;e, and the temper|ate u&s;e of diluted fermented liquors, particularly &s;ound bottled porter and claret, have the mo&s;t &s;alu|tary effect in preventing the operation of the conta|gion, and al&s;o of rendering the di&s;ea&s;e milder and more manageable by the phy&s;ician, when it does at|tack, than when it occurs in tho&s;e previou&s;ly debi|litated.</P>
<P>The air in the open &s;treets, I believe, never be|comes &s;ufficiently contaminated by the contagious articles (let the patients be ever &s;o numerous in the
<PB N="68" REF="033589_0069_0FF79311103166A8">
hou&s;es) to communicate the di&s;ea&s;e to any per&s;on walking in the middle of the &s;treet, or even on the pavements, when the wind blows from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. This is a fact not only confirmed by the ob|&s;ervations of the judicious and accurate Dr. Ru&s;&s;el, in his account of a pe&s;tilential fever at Aleppo, and by all the phy&s;icians that have publi&s;hed an account of the di&s;ea&s;e, as it has appeared in different parts of Europe, but is al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed by the events of la&s;t year, and by tho&s;e of '93.</P>
<P>In the year '93, all the pri&s;oners in the jail of Philadelphia, amounting to more than 200; the pen&s;ioners in the alms hou&s;e; and the patients in the Penn&s;ylvania ho&s;pital, e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e, ow|ing to the precaution of preventing the admi&s;&s;ion of any &s;ick or &s;u&s;picious per&s;on, as well as every infect|ed article into tho&s;e places.</P>
<P>All the families, al&s;o, that remained in the city, and confined them&s;elves and their dome&s;tics &s;trictly to their own hou&s;es, and &s;uffered no &s;ick per&s;on, or any one lately recovered from the di&s;order, or any material from an infected hou&s;e, to come near them; and employed &s;ome tru&s;ty per&s;on to furni&s;h them with marketing and other nece&s;&s;aries from &s;ources free from infection, e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e without ex|ception. This was al&s;o the ca&s;e with all the farmers that attended the market, that cautiou&s;ly avoided &s;leeping at, or going into any of the chambers of the taverns or places where they put up. This could not have been the ca&s;e if the whole atmo&s;phere of the city had been tainted, or replete with noxious exhalations.</P>
<P>By ob&s;erving the preceding rules and cautions, therefore, tho&s;e inhabitants who cannot procure a retreat in the country, may certainly pre&s;erve them|&s;elves from taking the fever.</P>
<P>The&s;e are con&s;olatory facts, drawn from experien|ced
<PB N="69" REF="033589_0070_0FF79316193CD4A8">
ob&s;ervers; and they are facts that may be fitly oppo&s;ed to the popular notions of contagion, &s;o apt to affect the imagination in moments of con&s;ternati|on and di&s;may.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I think it proper to add, that I have frequently &s;een per&s;ons, who&s;e office it is to attend the &s;ick, e&s;cape the di&s;ea&s;e in large airy apartments, without ob&s;erving any precaution at all; but have &s;eldom ob&s;erved this to be the ca&s;e in &s;mall confined places unfavourable for ventilation, e&s;peci|ally where the circum&s;tances of the patient, would not admit of daily changes of the bed and body lin|en. Cleanline&s;s, daily changes of apparel, and free ventilation appear, therefore, to be e&s;&s;ential for pre|venting the contagious and malignant effects of the fever.</P>
<P>Perhaps if phy&s;icians and nur&s;es were &s;tudiou&s;ly to guard again&s;t breathing when near the patient, and were never to &s;wallow their &s;aliva; (by which it is probable the contagion is more frequently con|veyed into the body than by any other means) were careful to rince their mouths with cold water and vinegar, brandy and water or wine, and frequently to chew &s;ome agreeable aromatic &s;ub&s;tance; were ne|ver to approach the &s;ick with an empty &s;tomach, and were to rub half a drachm or a drachm of mer|curial ointment upon their limbs every night till it occa&s;ioned tenderne&s;s of the mouth, it would prevent the contagion from operating, or at lea&s;t render the di&s;ea&s;e much more mild and manageable when it did occur.</P>

his paper, on account of the prevalence of a ma|lignant di&s;order in that place.</P>
<P><HI>(G. U. S.)</HI></P>
<P>The following intere&s;ting remarks were publi&s;hed in the Philadelphia Gazette of the 13th in&s;tant:</P>
<P>"WE are apt to magnify whatever re&s;pects our|&s;elves. It ought not therefore to be &s;urprizing if the papers of our city were full of remarks on the prevail|ing fever. The exten&s;ive mi&s;fortunes that it produ|ces occupying almo&s;t exclu&s;ively our attention, our &s;ub&s;cribers at a di&s;tance would not fail to li&s;ten with an indulgent ear to our tale of di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;uffer us to fly to the only &s;olace left us, that of expre&s;&s;ing our &s;orrow. So far, however, have the citizens of Phi|ladelphia been from indulging them&s;elves in fruitle&s;s expre&s;&s;ions of regret, that our papers contain few animadver&s;ions, and no di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, re&s;pecting the di&s;ea&s;e. They have not omitted to record facts, but every mind has been &s;uffered without prejudice to form its own deductions. This APPARENT apathy has ri&s;en not from any real indifference or want of feeling, but from a conviction derived from expe|rience, that in the colli&s;ion of ho&s;tile opinions, hu|manity is often lo&s;t &s;ight of, and an ob&s;tinate adher|ence to error is generated in its room. In the year '93 the medical pen was, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, dipped in gall. The &s;everal combatants took their peculiar grounds and di&s;dained, in too many ca&s;es, to &s;ave the life of a human being by following any other &s;ugge&s;tions, than their own. They di&s;tracted the public mind, and &s;hook all confidence in medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The very rever&s;e of this has been exhibited du|ring the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on. No men have allied toge|ther in &s;upport of a favourite theory. The pride of opinion has exi&s;ted but in a limited &s;phere. The practice of one phy&s;ician has become a&s;&s;imilated to
<PB N="71" REF="033589_0072_0FF7931A7B0F4EF8">
that of another; and from the be&s;t information tho&s;e pre&s;criptions appear to be very generally pur&s;ued, which are mild, and more congenial to nature than tho&s;e remedies, if remedies they may be called, which too often only re&s;cue us from the di&s;ea&s;e to inflict upon us one more fatal.</P>
<P>"The&s;e ideas will not, at pre&s;ent, be pur&s;ued further. The chief de&s;ign of the&s;e notices is to ex|hibit the &s;uperior malignity of the pre&s;ent di&s;ea&s;e over that which prevailed in '93. It is computed that in that year 23,000 citizens left the city. They formed probably two-fifths of the inhabitants. This year certainly three-fourths, but more likely five-&s;ixths of the citizens, have departed. Taking the intermediate number, the re&s;ult will be that twice the proportion of citizens remained in Philadelphia in '93 that do this year. Some allowance, however, is to be made for the increa&s;ed population. But on the other hand, when the caution of the citizens is con&s;idered, and the arrangements that were made to re&s;i&s;t its influence this year, the la&s;t circum&s;tances will be found to balance the former. Be&s;ides it ought to be remembered, that in a place contain|ing a given population, if an epidemic rages, its vi|olence is not checked in the exact ratio of the dimi|nution of the inhabitants, but with much more ra|pidity. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e circum&s;tances, the di&s;ea&s;e continues to rear its head, and to threaten mortality this year &s;uperior to that in '93."</P>

<P>THE great advantage to be derived to man|kind, from an in&s;pection of the bodies of &s;uch as have died of &s;o formidable an epidemic, as the yel|low fever, mu&s;t be obvious to all. The following ca&s;es of di&s;&s;ection may throw &s;ome light on the na|ture of the di&s;ea&s;e, as it prevails in this town, and may, we hope, be of &s;ome u&s;e, in inve&s;tigating the treatment be&s;t adapted to the purpo&s;e of checking or &s;uppre&s;&s;ing its de&s;tructive ravages.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ca&s;e was of a man, who died on the 6th day from the &s;eizure, and as no application was made to a phy&s;ician, till the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e had nearly expired, the &s;tate of the organs may be con&s;idered in a great mea&s;ure as the natural effect of the di&s;ea&s;e, undi&s;turbed by art.</P>
<P>In the cavity of the che&s;t, the lungs were re|markably affected&mdash;They contained an uncommon quantity of dark blood in their ve&s;&s;els, which ren|dered them apparently more den&s;e than u&s;ual; the ve&s;icles not being di&s;tended with air, and their &s;ub|&s;tance con&s;equently le&s;s compre&s;&s;ible than u&s;ual.&mdash;The po&s;terior part of both lobes was extremely livid, and in the cavities of the thorax was contained a large portion of extrava&s;ated blood, firmly coagu|lated, to the quantity of eight or ten ounces, as nearly as could be e&s;timated.</P>
<P>The pericadium contained as much as two or three ounces of fluid blood. The heart was of its u&s;ual &s;ize; but the coronary veins were &s;o di&s;tended
<PB N="74" REF="033589_0075_0FF793235A56D7F8">
with blood, as to exhibit the appearance of a mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful injection. In the cavity of the abdomen, the part mo&s;t con&s;picuou&s;ly morbid was the liver.&mdash;This organ appeared to be much inflamed both on its convex and concave &s;urface; its &s;ub&s;tance was much indurated, and on cutting, re&s;embled in co|lour, a boiled liver. The gall bladder was contract|ed to a very &s;mall &s;ize, and contained not more than a quarter of an ounce of a thick, glutinous, and al|mo&s;t in&s;pi&s;&s;ated &s;ub&s;tance, re&s;embling pith. There were no marks of any con&s;iderable quantity of the bile having been lately contained in the &s;ack, and none of the neighbouring parts had the lea&s;t tinge that denoted its pre&s;ence. On cutting through the ductus communis choledochus, no bile i&s;&s;ued from the aperture; the hepatic duct had al&s;o evidently for &s;ome time, cea&s;ed to tran&s;mit its fluid from the li|ver. The &s;tomach exhibited an enormous di&s;ten&s;i|on of its veins, e&s;pecially round the pylorus, and had every mark of great inflammation. The inte&s;tines in general, were in the &s;ame &s;tate with the &s;tomach; the &s;maller were con&s;iderably di&s;tended, and the lar|ger contracted. The &s;pleen was uncommonly tur|gid, but in other re&s;pects in its natural &s;tate. The peritonaeum on the under &s;ide of the diaphragm, and the pleura on the upper, bore the ve&s;tiges of in|flammation, but no other parts of tho&s;e membranes appeared to have been di&s;ea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The omentum was con&s;iderably thickened, and from the turge&s;cence of its blood ve&s;&s;els, of a colour unu&s;ually dark. There were no appearances in the thoracic or abdominal vi&s;cera of &s;uppuration, nor was any degree of foeter perceived to ari&s;e from them; nor was there the lea&s;t mark of even incipient putrifaction in any part of the body. It may be proper to remark on this ca&s;e, that in every &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, the di&s;charges from the bowels, were of
<PB N="75" REF="033589_0076_0FF79324EE44E4F8">
the colour and con&s;i&s;tence of water gruel, excepting a few evacuations of a matter &s;imilar to what is called the black vomit; and that this u&s;ually fatal &s;ymptom had al&s;o preceded the patient's death on the fourth day of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;econd ca&s;e. The &s;ubject of this di&s;&s;ecti|on was the body of a per&s;on, who died on the 12th day of the attack with &s;ymptoms of a mixed kind; a remi&s;&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e had taken place at the peri|od u&s;ually critical, upon which, on the 6th day, a delirium en&s;ued, and continued to the moment of fatal termination.</P>
<P>On opening the cranium, the brain was found to have its ve&s;&s;els a&s;toni&s;hingly de&s;tined with blood, an ounce or two of &s;erum was effu&s;ed between the dura and pia mater. Under the &s;agittal future, and by the &s;ide of the longitudinal &s;inus, where the large veins terminate in that cavity, a lymphatic band, about an inch wide, extending nearly the whole length of the &s;inus, was formed by the coagulable lymph, which had been effu&s;ed from the blood ve&s;|&s;els, by the violence of the preceding inflammation, and this &s;ub&s;tance had &s;erved as a medium of adhe&s;i|on, between the dura and pia mater in that part.</P>
<P>The lungs adhered very firmly to the pleura on the right &s;ide, and appeared po&s;teriorly to have been much inflamed, and in &s;ome parts to be indu|rated in portions of about the &s;ize of a pigeon's egg. The left lobe adhered &s;o firmly to the pleura, as not to be &s;eparated but by tearing the &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs, which here appeared extremely di&s;ea&s;ed, and in a &s;tate of actual &s;uppuration throughout its whole &s;ub&s;tance. The heart was in its natural &s;tate. The liver was much enlarged, and in a &s;tate that denoted a high degree of inflammation; the convex &s;urface, of the great lobe near the gall bladder exhibiting marks of extrava&s;ation, as if violently contu&s;ed.&mdash;
<PB N="76" REF="033589_0077_0FF79326DA5C61F0">
The gall bladder was full of bile, and the ducts per|vious.</P>
<P>The &s;tomach was nearly in its natural &s;tate, but on the in&s;ide, the &s;urface of the villous coat, was be&s;meared with a matter, which &s;eemed to be of the &s;ame nature with the black vomit, tho' nothing of this kind had been ejected in the cour&s;e of the di&s;|ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The duoderum, was much inflamed for &s;everal inches from its commencement at the &s;tomach, and the whole tract of the &s;maller inte&s;tines was in the &s;ame &s;tate. The urinary bladder was contracted to the &s;ize of a pullet's egg, and its inner coat appeared to have been in a high &s;tate of inflammation, the ve&s;|&s;els having been di&s;tended to &s;uch a degree, as to have &s;uffered a rupture, and to have effu&s;ed a quan|tity of blood into the cavity of this organ.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the lungs in this &s;ubject, was pro|bably the con&s;equence, chiefly of a previous di&s;ea&s;e, independent of that which proved fatal here. An af|fection of the lungs had &s;ometime exi&s;ted, whil&s;t the &s;ubject was in other re&s;pects intolerable health, and in the pur&s;uit of his bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o that a pulmonary con|&s;umption would in all probability, have &s;hortly put a period to his life, had the di&s;ea&s;e of which he died, never overtaken him.</P>
<P>The third ca&s;e. In this in&s;tance the di&s;ea&s;e terminated fatally on the fourth day.</P>
<P>Upon opening the thorax, the lungs di&s;cover|ed marks of inflammation, anteriorly, and were ex|tremely gorged with blood, in the po&s;terior part of their re&s;pective lobes.</P>
<P>The liver exhibited marks of inflammation e&s;|pecially on its concave &s;ide, and po&s;terior part; its texture was altered, and of a very den&s;e con&s;i&s;tence. The gall bladder was completely obliterated, its coats having coale&s;ced with the contiguous parts &s;o
<PB N="77" REF="033589_0078_0FF79328C6F10210">
as to form with them one confu&s;ed membranous &s;ub&s;tance. The &s;tomach was externally to appear|ance in a natural &s;tate, but its inner coat was cover|ed with that black coloured fluid, denominated the black vomit.</P>
<P>The color in &s;ome parts had been much infla|med, as well as part of the omentum where attached to this inte&s;tine.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, that in both the ca&s;es, where the gall bladder had been di&s;ea&s;ed, and cea&s;ed to perform its functions; or where the liver had been rendered incapable of &s;ecreting the bile, the body became yellow, before death; whereas in the other, where the bile was found in due quantity, this cir|cum&s;tance did not occur.</P>
<P>From the above di&s;&s;ections, which evinced a deficiency of &s;ecretion in the billary organs, the in|dications of cure &s;eemed to be directed towards a cour&s;e, which might obviate the inflammation in ge|neral of the organs di&s;ea&s;ed, and open the excretory ducts of the liver, that the fluid might re&s;ume its cour&s;e into the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>It is with the highe&s;t degree of plea&s;ure, that we communicate to the public our hopes that after pro|per evacuations, the u&s;e of calomel may be found to an&s;wer the&s;e important purpo&s;es. This medicine has been accordingly u&s;ed with much &s;ucce&s;s in fif|teen patients within eighteen days, all of whom, ex|cepting one, have recovered; or have pa&s;t the dan|gerous period. It has been given not in the u&s;ual do&s;es, for the purpo&s;e of an evacuant by the inte&s;|tines, but in &s;mall do&s;es of one, two or three grains, every hour or two, &s;o as to produce a &s;ali|vation as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; with this view, from one hundred to two hundred and thirty grains of calomel have been given in the cour&s;e of two or three days, commencing the u&s;e of it immediately after the fir&s;t
<PB N="78" REF="033589_0079_0FF792AA98666A08">
copious evacuations by bleeding and purging; and in every in&s;tance as the &s;alivation came on, the di&s;|ea&s;e has abated.</P>
<P>Coinciding in &s;entiment, re&s;pecting the u&s;e of mercury, &s;o as to produce a &s;alivation, we with plea&s;ure mention the learned doctor Ru&s;h, of Phila|delphia. But the method is more explicitly and highly recommended by James Clark, M. D. F. R. S. E. in a treati&s;e on the yellow fever, as it appeared in the i&s;land of Dominica, in the years, '93, '94, '95, and '96.</P>
<P>The doctor recommends the free u&s;e of mercu|ry, both as a remedy and preventative&mdash;and &s;ays, the officers of the army and navy, who have lei|&s;ure and can be prevailed upon, on their arrival in the We&s;t-Indies, to undergo one or two cour&s;es of mercury, taking a few laxative medicines, after con|fining them&s;elves to a moderate u&s;e of wine, and living chiefly on vegetables and fruits for the fir&s;t two months after their arrival, may rely almo&s;t to a certainty, on e&s;caping the fever.</P>

<P>A negro man entered the hou&s;e and found the body of a man almo&s;t devoured by vermin; infor|mation was given at the Health-Office, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon; the people waited till 8 o'clock in the evening and heard nothing from the Health-Office, two black men were hired for &s;ix|teen dollars, to take the corps and throw it into the

<P>In an adverti&s;ement &s;igned by Mr. Saml.

Ex|cepting the nur&s;e, there has been but one other per|&s;on &s;ick in the Ho&s;pital of the fever this year, <ABBR>viz:</ABBR> a man that was admitted as a lunatic the 25th ult.

<P>Similar accounts have been received from the little villages of Che&s;ter and Marcus-Hook, on the river Delaware, between Philadelphia and Wilming|ton.</P>
<P>It appears from a communication from Dr. Da|vid&s;on to Dr. Mea&s;e, publi&s;hed in the Medical Re|po&s;itory of New-York, that the atmo&s;phere of the We&s;t India I&s;lands, where the fever is &s;o frequently malignant and mortal, contains a con&s;iderably great|er proportion of pure air than the atmo&s;phere in any part of Europe.

<P>FELLOW CITZENS, reflect upon your danger before it is too late. One hundred of us are attack|ed with the fever every day. One half of that num|ber is daily carried to the grave.

<HEAD>REMARKS, WHICH FOLLOW THE ABOVE.</HEAD>
<P>The above return has excited con&s;iderable ad|ditional alarm in town and country. It is certainly melancholly: but we de&s;ire to prai&s;e Heaven, a &s;mart north-ea&s;terly &s;torm, which we hope and an|ticipate, will check the march and di&s;&s;ipate the ma|lignancy of the pe&s;tilence, and thoroughly clean&s;e our atmo&s;phere, ye&s;terday morning commenced its &s;alutary operation, and terminated la&s;t evening in a &s;trong north-we&s;ter. We expect in a few days to congratulate our friends in the country, on the re|turn of Hygeia to the metropolis; and to invite their return.</P>
<P>In continuing this melancholy detail, we cannot &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e painful emotions, which naturally ari&s;e, when contemplating one of the greate&s;t cala|mities which ever befel an infant nation. Almo&s;t all the &s;eaports of the United States has, more or le&s;s, within the&s;e few years, been vi&s;ited with a pe&s;ti|lence which threatens to depopulate many of our faire&s;t towns and villages. To arre&s;t the progre&s;s of this de&s;troying angel, has as yet, been attempted in vain. It appears to defy the &s;cience, &s;kill, and in|trepidity of our mo&s;t eminent phy&s;icians&mdash;and to yield to nothing but the fro&s;ts of winter. It &s;eri|ou&s;ly behoves every well-wi&s;her to his country, to continue to &s;earch for the cau&s;e of the calamity, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to remove it.</P>

<HEAD>September 29th.</HEAD>
<P>Died this morning, Mr. Jo&s;eph Anthony, a re|&s;pectable and di&s;tingui&s;hed merchant of Philadelphia. He re&s;ided in High, near Ninth-&s;treet.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="033589_0093_0FF7933A3367A330">
The phy&s;icians of the encampment pre&s;cribed for 32 patients to-day, not one of whom had any &s;ymptom of the yellow fever&mdash;but the greate&s;t pro|portion complained of diarrhoea, catarrh, intermitting fever, or cutaneous eruption.</P>
<P>There are at pre&s;ent at the encampment more than 1300 per&s;ons including children.</P>
<P>Mr. Cooper, town clerk of Bo&s;ton, &s;tates that &s;ince the return on the 24th to the 26th of Septem|ber, 20 per&s;ons have recovered, 7 have died, 44 new ca&s;es have occurred, 97 remaining &s;ick, 20 of whom are on the recovery.</P>
<P>From 26th to 28th, 26 had recovered, 5 died and 12 new ca&s;es had occurred, 72 remaining &s;ick, of whom 30 were on the recovery.</P>
<P>Mr. Cooper a&s;&s;ures the public, that the above re|turns are particularly correct.</P>
<P>Dr. Campbell of Woodberry, and Dr. Martin of Che&s;ter, both phy&s;icians of eminence, are dead of the prevailing di&s;ea&s;e,</P>
<P>Provi&s;ion has been amply made for the more in|digent and needy, and for all who can &s;ubmit to take &s;helter at the encampment, or to reque&s;t &s;upplies from the guardians of the poor, but the &s;ituation of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility will not permit them to have recour&s;e to the&s;e re&s;ources, mu&s;t be attended with di&s;tre&s;s that may be better conceived than de&s;crib|ed.</P>

<P>A con&s;iderable number of ca&s;es of pure intermit|tents have occurred on the high grounds within two miles of the city; in one family near the encamp|ment on Ma&s;ters' place, five of the family have had regular paroxi&s;ms and intermi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Harri&s;burgh which was much infe&s;ted with inter|mitting and remitting fevers, and the dy&s;entry for|merly in hot &s;ummers, has been remarkably healthy the pre&s;ent &s;ummer; owing to the removal of a mill|dam, which formerly occa&s;ioned an exten&s;ive tract of ground near the town to be overflowed.</P>
<P>Two of the criminals in the jail, were di&s;covered undermining the wall of the ea&s;t dungeon ye&s;ter|day.</P>
<P>The jail is now under the care of Peter Helm, who performed &s;uch meritorious &s;ervices at the ho&s;pi|tal in 1793. The former jailor from dread of the fever, had relinqui&s;hed his charge.</P>
<P>The American Howard, has al&s;o taken up his abode in that dreary man&s;ion of the lawle&s;s vota|ries of rapine and di&s;order, for the purpo&s;e of em|ploying means to prevent the di&s;ea&s;e from &s;preading there.</P>
<P>Accounts from New-York, &s;tate that the late nor|therly and N. W. breeze has had a favourable effect upon the fever. At Philadelphia the number of new ca&s;es are al&s;o reduced though as had been predicted, the mortality was greater upon its fir&s;t coming on.</P>
<P>Several per&s;ons from the country who were at the friends yearly meeting, in the city have been attack|ed with fever &s;ince their return home.</P>

<P>Seven deaths at Bo&s;ton on the 27th. la&s;t and 79 &s;ick.</P>
<P>All the pa&s;ture grounds appear parched up, and all the &s;prings are become remarkably low.</P>
<P>The flats along the Schuylkill, and the creeks that empty into the Delaware, expo&s;e more mud to the rays of the &s;un than u&s;ual, and give origin to nume|rous ca&s;es of intermittents, but there has not been an in&s;tance of a ca&s;e of malignant or yellow fever ap|pearing any where in the vicinity of the Schuylkill, as far as I have been able to learn.</P>
<P>"At Marcus-hook, 2 per&s;ons from Philadelphia were attacked with the fever, and died &s;oon after; five of the family with whom they re&s;ided, were at|tacked in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and every one died"</P>

<P>"We hope the di&s;order in our city is abating, from the number of new ca&s;es being much le&s;s for the four la&s;t days, than for &s;ome time before, altho' the number of the inhabitants remain nearly the &s;ame. The deaths &s;till about 40. The di&s;order is much among the poor, who are unable to procure &s;uitable nur&s;ing. Simple remedies are found mo&s;t availing. Ca&s;tor oil and &s;alts, with injections, are all the medicines, excepting lime water and milk, that are given by our mo&s;t &s;kilful and &s;ucce&s;sful phy|&s;icians. Herb teas, particularly catmint, are very freely u&s;ed to occa&s;ion per&s;piration, and where the patient has an attentive and prudent nur&s;e, they ge|nerally under this treatment have recovered. Ele|ven per&s;ons have been &s;ick in my hou&s;e, and except|ing one, have all been treated in this way, and all recovered. My &s;i&s;ter had calomel, and &s;uffered more than the others, though her attack was much le&s;s &s;evere than either of them. I could mention other in&s;tances, but this may &s;uffice. This practice is now &s;o generally u&s;ed, that many in&s;tances occur, where the nur&s;es never call for the aid of a phy&s;ici|an, and have much &s;ucce&s;s."</P>

<P>In a letter from Dr. Mitchell of Virginia, ad|dre&s;&s;ed to Dr. Franklin, it is a&s;&s;erted, "That blood-letting, upon the fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of the pain in the head, frequently prevented the di&s;ea&s;e from forming, e&s;pecially when an emetic was given immediately after, and a &s;weat rai&s;ed by diluting acid drinks."</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e has vi&s;ibly declined in the city &s;ince the late cold weather.</P>

<P>Total deaths &s;ince the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, 836 men, 427 women, and 293 children; 1110 of the fever, and 446 of other di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;Total, 1556.</P>
<P>(Porc. Gaz. of Oct. 6.)</P>
<P>The health committee of New-London, in their report of the 25th ult. recommend to the citizens who have moved out, not to return at pre&s;ent, as the number of new ca&s;es la&s;t week, has exceeded any preceding week.</P>
<P>Twenty-two per&s;ons &s;ick at the encampment;&mdash;only one of whom had any &s;ymptoms re&s;embling the malignant or yellow fever. The complaints are opthalmia 4&mdash;remitting fever 1&mdash;intermitting fever 6&mdash;all with regular cold and hot &s;tages, &s;ucceeded by perfect intermi&s;&s;ions; &s;ome quotidians, and &s;ome tertiant.&mdash;Spurious pleuri&s;y 2&mdash;rheumati&s;m 2&mdash;di|arrhoea 1&mdash;diarrhoea infantum 3&mdash;dy&s;entery 2.</P>
<P>Dr. Mitchell of Virginia, in a letter written &s;ome years &s;ince to Dr. Franklin, a&s;&s;erts, "That the yellow fever has chiefly raged in America in large families, towns, camps or &s;hips, and has been twice brought into Virginia by &s;hips of war;" and adds, "It is remarkably contagious, as appears from the greate&s;t part of a family being affected by it from per&s;ons who had taken it in another place.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="033589_0106_0FF7934E94326900">
"The mo&s;t effectual remedies were lenient pur|ges and cly&s;ters frequently repeated till a copious diarrhoea and bilious &s;tool en&s;ued; with aqueous and bland drinks, and occa&s;ional bleedings adapted to the indications expre&s;&s;ed by the pul&s;e and pain of head, &s;tomach or inte&s;tines. He al&s;o a&s;&s;ures him, that he found mild purges and cly&s;ters much more effectual than any other remedies &s;o long as the pain and tenderne&s;s of the &s;tomach, and con&s;tant propen|&s;ity to puke continued, upon receiving any thing into it, without regard to the period or duration of the di&s;ea&s;e, though the lowle&s;s of the pul&s;e &s;eemed to oppo&s;e it."</P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;everal ca&s;es this year of per&s;ons that had the di&s;ea&s;e in '93 and '97, and have &s;een &s;everal in&s;tances of rein&s;ection every time that the di&s;ea&s;e has appeared in the city &s;ince the year '93.</P>
<P>Hannah Norris died at M. Fi&s;her's <ABBR>e&s;q.</ABBR> &s;eve|ral weeks after having recovered from the fir&s;t at|tack in '93. Dr. Plea&s;ants died under &s;imilar cir|cum&s;tances in '97. Mr. Young, Mr. Conoly, Mr. Taylor, Mrs. Li&s;le, and &s;everal others, recovered af|ter a &s;econd attack. This year Drs. Cooper, Mea&s;e, and Leib, David Parke, Mrs. Mendenhall, and &s;eve|ral others, had the di&s;ea&s;e that had it before. Tho&s;e ca&s;es, however, have been very few in compari&s;on of tho&s;e that have e&s;caped it, who have once had it.</P>
<P>It appears from Dr. Stark's di&s;&s;ections, that an in|flammation of the &s;tomach, however induced, is at|tended with the &s;ame &s;ymptoms as the yellow fever; and that what is called the black vomit is owing to a mortification of the vellous coat of the &s;tomach,
<PB N="106" REF="033589_0107_0FF7935067773DB0">
and blood which has e&s;caped from the dilated ve&s;|&s;els and become putrid.</P>
<P>[See Stark's Clinical and Anato|mical Ob&s;ervations.]</P>
<P>It appears from Dr. Crawford's experiments, that the ga&s;es or aerial exhalations, extricated from the fle&s;h of animals, by putrefaction, con&s;i&s;t of animal hepatic air, i. e. hydrogen holding &s;ulphur in &s;oluti|on, with a &s;mall proportion of azotic gas, or air de|prived of its ozygene. And the &s;mell of the breath and of the per&s;pirable matter, in malignant fevers, evidently demon&s;trate that they contain animal hep|atic, hydrogenous gas, and not &s;uper oxygenated azote, as has been pre&s;umed by Dr. S. L. Mitchell, of New-York.</P>
<P>In the&s;e fevers a viciated &s;ecretion takes place, and the excretions occa&s;ion a &s;imilar fever when taken into a sound body.</P>

where &s;o much caution and prudence is requir|ed.</P>

The Board earne&s;tly &s;olicit public attention to con&s;iderations &s;o important; and entreat the forbearance of their fellow-citizens, until returning health &s;hall invite them home.</P>
<P>The Board cannot too &s;trongly impre&s;s the pro|priety and nece&s;&s;ity of clean&s;ing and purifying, (pre|vious to the return of the inhabitants), the bedding, cloathing, and hou&s;es, in which the di&s;ea&s;e has ex|i&s;ted; for which purpo&s;e, they recommend <HI>the libe|ral u&s;e of lime.</HI> They al&s;o repeat their recommen|dation to the commi&s;&s;ioners, to have the pumps fre|quently and copiou&s;ly worked, as the water is ex|tremely offen&s;ive and unwhole&s;ome.</P>
<P>The Board a&s;&s;ure their fellow-citizens that when|ever the health of the City and Liberties &s;hall be &s;o re&s;tored as to admit of the return of the inhabitants with &s;afety, not a moment &s;hall be delayed in an|nouncing the glad tidings.</P>

<P>It &s;eems difficult to a&s;certain the ri&s;e and pro|gre&s;s of this fatal di&s;ea&s;e; but the circum&s;tances re|lated are the&s;e:</P>
<P>1&s;t. I under&s;tand the &s;hip Ne&s;tor, in which the &s;u&s;pected infection came, was from Philadelphia or Bo&s;ton; but what pa&s;&s;age &s;he had, I know not.</P>
<P>2d. 'Tis reported that three &s;ailors died on board before &s;he reached City Point.</P>
<P>3d. Before my youth went on board, a negro a&s;hore advi&s;ed him not to go there, for people had died in that &s;hip of the fever; and when the captain came a&s;hore with the boat for them, he refu&s;ed go|ing; but the captain &s;eriou&s;ly avered that the negro was angry with him, and reported this maliciou&s;ly to the young men, who at length con&s;ented to go.</P>
<P>4th. The &s;hip had nothing in but dirt bala&s;t from the town &s;he left, and it being Sunday, all or chief part of the hands were a&s;hore. The day be|fore, they had pumped out of her &s;everal gallons of fetid bilge water, the &s;cent of which even then remain|ed unplea&s;ant, for it had been in her &s;ome weeks.&mdash;Mo&s;t of the hands who pumped it &s;ickened and died, as did &s;everal of tho&s;e who helped to land the bal|la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="033589_0112_0FF7935CCD523F70">
5th. Since the youths left the &s;hip, &s;everal per|&s;ons in that neighbourhood have died of the like fe|ver, and Dr. Walker, who vi&s;ited them while a black vomiting was on &s;ome of them, is now very &s;ick in the hou&s;e oppo&s;ite us, but I hope is recover|ing.</P>
<P>6th. The youths left the &s;hip at 6 o'clock P. M. and from getting aground frequently did not re|turn home before midnight. In the day they were expo&s;ed to an hot &s;un, and at night to an heavy dew.</P>
<P>7th. On the Tue&s;day of that &s;ame week, at 12 o'clock, my lad was taken with an ague, and before night every one of the party that went in the ve&s;&s;el had an high fever, but two of the negroes who went to row and avoided the &s;hip, e&s;caped the fever.&mdash;Many are willing to attribute the di&s;ea&s;e to the af|fects of the &s;un and dew, and &s;ay the&s;e negroes kept up per&s;piration by rowing home, while the whites lay expo&s;ed to the cool dew in an open boat. My youth was bled on Wedne&s;day morning, but his veins were &s;o &s;mall and low, that Dr. Shore could not let as much blood as he wi&s;hed, (only a tea cup full) for they approve of copious bleeding. His complaint was a deadly &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, with pains in every limb, attended with frequent vomit|ing of yellow bile. During his di&s;order he took a quantity of pills which operated well; injections were admini&s;tered; each temple cup'd; &s;tomach and legs bli&s;tered; and the la&s;t medicine given was, I believe, an emetic powder. On Saturday he was very re&s;tle&s;s, and at night a delirium and &s;tupor came on; thus he remained till Sunday, when the above emetic was given, &s;oon after which he made &s;ome efforts to vomit, but did not; his eyes began to vi|brate exceedingly, and with much oppre&s;&s;ion at his brea&s;t, he expired. His corps was not more yellow
<PB N="112" REF="033589_0113_0FF79361E8018038">
than u&s;ual; four per&s;ons were interred when he was, carried off by fevers, I believe.</P>
<P>The captain (Wil&s;on) of the &s;hip Delight, which lay near the Ne&s;tor, and with whom the youths dined, did not live &s;o long as my lad; but he was a very intemperate man, even in his &s;ickne&s;s, and had been on Monday expo&s;ed to wet and the heat of the &s;un. He died in town, di&s;tracted with the fever and liquor he drank when he came up.&mdash;The eyes of every one were remarkably gla&s;&s;y, in|flamed, but not red as is generally repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>This &s;ummer I went to the tin factory oppo&s;ite us, to get &s;ome tin which they kept in a back hou&s;e; the yard was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive filthy, I a&s;ked them if they were hatching the yellow fever? they hoped not; but every creature of them have had a fever like the above; &s;ome had it before the &s;hipping came; and &s;everal about this town have the like fever, but are chiefly on the recovery. One Mr. Cooper, an En|gli&s;h merchant at Blandford, (in this town) died ye&s;|terday morning; and I &s;uppo&s;e there are four or five in town &s;ick of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e. Our family phy&s;ician is ju&s;t recovering; his head was bli&s;tered, and he was delirious &s;everal days. One of the tin|ners told me he &s;uffered more with it in one day, than with all the pain and &s;ickne&s;s of his whole life, (which was 30 years) and could get no relief till the doctor allowed him to drink cold water in &s;mall draughts at a time. This enabled him to keep his medicine down, which he could not do before. Our phy&s;icians think the di&s;ea&s;e originates from the &s;un, heat, dew, filth, &amp;c.&mdash;probably it does, for no one caught it of my young man; and had it been the &s;mall-pox, I dare &s;ay they would have felt the affects of it. Every do&s;e of medicine I gave him with my own hand, that he might have a fair chance. I u&s;ed no preventative, but burnt tar frequently in the
<PB N="113" REF="033589_0114_0FF79363870B9AA8">
hou&s;e and &s;prinkled it fore and aft with vinegar, keeping every window open day and night. Since writing the above, I under&s;tand that two of the Rich|mond craft, that had been employed at one of the&s;e &s;hips, lo&s;t almo&s;t every hand on board; one of them had only a boy left. We have cool nights now, but the middle of the day is very warm and dry. When our family phy&s;ician (Dr. Shore) recovers, you &s;hall know more of this fever. I have been much confi|ned at home; and as City Point is 12 miles off, and &s;everal &s;hips have been there, I cannot get a &s;atis|factory account of it. I believe &s;everal died in one of the &s;hips at the Cape, but the captain endeavoured to conceal it, that it might not prevent his getting hands. Your friend and &s;ervant.</P>

<P>Several of the criminals in the ea&s;t-wing of the jail, undermined the wall and made their e&s;cape in the night of the 13th in&s;t.</P>
<P>The following account, delivered me in writing this morning, by C. Mar&s;hall, jun. who re&s;ided in the neighbourhood, where the facts occurred, (and collected at my reque&s;t) incontrovertibly proves, that the yellow fever is not contagious in the air of cities only, but is &s;ometimes contagious in &s;ituations that are noted for &s;alubrity:</P>
<P>Elizabeth John&s;on, about 10 years of age, came from Philadelphia to her mother's (the widow John|&s;on) the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">th of Augu&s;t; was taken ill with the fever on the 10th, and died on the 13th.&mdash;Elizabeth Duy, a near neighbour who had been &s;everal times to vi|&s;it E. John&s;on, was attacked in a &s;imilar manner on the 26th of Augu&s;t, and died on the 30th.&mdash;Mary Hubbs, a near neighbour to E. Duy, and vi&s;ited her in her &s;ickne&s;s, was taken with fever on the 29th of Augu&s;t, and died the 3d of September.&mdash;Charles, &s;on of Mary Hubbs, was taken with the fever the &s;ame day, with his mother, and recovered in the cour&s;e of a week.&mdash;Chri&s;t. Duy, hu&s;band of Eliza|beth, was taken ill on the 16th of September, and
<PB N="115" REF="033589_0116_0FF79366CE0F6168">
died on the 23d.&mdash;Elizabeth John&s;on, mother to the fir&s;t mentioned Elizabeth, was taken ill the 21&s;t of September, and died on the 29th.&mdash;Jo&s;eph Fi&s;her and his wife had an apartment at Chri&s;t. Duy's. Jo|&s;eph Fi&s;her's wife took &s;ick &s;oon after the death of C. Duy, and recovered.&mdash;Jo&s;eph Fi&s;her was taken ill on the 22d of September, and died on the 27th.&mdash;The widow John&s;on's &s;ervant maid was taken ill about the &s;ame time with E. John&s;on, and recovered in 8 days. Elizabeth Star, who lived in Mrs. John|&s;on's family, was taken ill on the 27th of September, and died on the 14th of October, though &s;he had been freely &s;alivated. None of the above had been in the city for &s;everal weeks.</P>

<P>Thirty-&s;ix patients &s;ick at the encampment to|day&mdash;mo&s;t part with light complaints, &s;uch as ca|tarrh and diarrhoea. Only two new ca&s;es of malig|nant fever have occurred at the encampment for &s;ome days. One of the&s;e has been ill eleven days&mdash;had the black vomit ever &s;ince the 7th, from the attack&mdash;is at this in&s;tant with &s;carcely any appear|ance of life. This woman, who&s;e name is Makit|trick, was attacked five days after a vi&s;it to the city&mdash;Takes lime water and fre&s;h milk. Peter Tryon, the other ca&s;e of the yellow fever, was attacked the day after he came to the encampment&mdash;this his 3d day.</P>
<P>From comparing the effects of mercury, in differ|ent ca&s;es, it appears to me, now, to be proper to excite &s;alivation in every ca&s;e where malignant &s;ymp|toms are evident at an early period of the fever; but that it is &s;uperfluous, if not injurious, to induce &s;a|livation in ca&s;es where inflammatory &s;ymptoms are predominant, till the&s;e are induced by &s;ufficient
<PB N="116" REF="033589_0117_0FF7936C525D4F28">
blood-letting and purging, which in the majority of ca&s;es &s;o circum&s;tanced, cure the di&s;ea&s;e without the aid of any additional remedy. The yellow fever corre&s;ponds in this re&s;pect with the variolous fever, or &s;mall-pox. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where the eruption appears with a confluent a&s;pect, accompanied with great debility, oppre&s;&s;ion, and unea&s;ine&s;s about the region of the heart, mercury has been long recom|mended by &s;everal eminent phy&s;icians as a more effectual remedy than any other, when re&s;trained by the addition of opium, from occa&s;ioning frequent evacuations by the bowels. But I believe no one can deem it nece&s;&s;ary to employ &s;o violent a reme|dy in the di&s;tinct and &s;imple form of the di&s;ea&s;e, when more &s;afe ones will an&s;wer as well.</P>
<P>It was the general practice la&s;t year, as well as the pre&s;ent, to give mercury in all ca&s;es indi&s;crimi|nately, which was certainly injudicious, and in ma|ny ca&s;es retarded the cure, e&s;pecially in ca&s;es ac|companied with inflammatory &s;ymptoms; but in ca&s;es where nervous &s;ymptoms predominated from the beginning, &amp; unaccompanied with &s;evere pain in the head, eyes, or &s;tomach, or with &s;ymptoms of dy&s;en|tery or gravel, calomel was found more &s;ucce&s;sful when given in do&s;es of two grains every two hours, and the application of two or three drachms of &s;trong mercurial ointment to the region of the liver and to different parts of the body four times in the cour&s;e of every 24 hours, re&s;training the mercury by the addition of a few drops of laudanum, occa&s;ional|ly, if it occa&s;ioned more than one or two evacuati|ons in the cour&s;e of the day, till &s;igns of &s;alivation appeared, and no longer; the patient, at the &s;ame time, ab&s;taining from all fle&s;h meats and vinous li|quors. The early and repeated application of bli&s;|ters, in &s;uch ca&s;es, were generally beneficial; but blood-letting did injury.</P>

<HEAD> From the Philadelphia Gazette of this date. A DESCRIPTION Of the ENCAMPMENT at Ma&s;ters' place.</HEAD>
<P>THE encampment at Ma&s;ters' place is an im|men&s;e work, con&s;idering the &s;hort period in which it was executed. Buildings comfortable, convenient, and in every re&s;pect well adapted to the occa&s;ion, have been erected in eight or nine days, &s;ufficient to accommodate 2000 people. Be&s;ides tho&s;e build|ings, there were erected, in the &s;ame time, an ho&s;pi|tal, a large &s;tore-hou&s;e and offices, a bake-hou&s;e and oven, and five kitchens, each with eight large fire places. This little town is built on a well cho&s;en &s;pot, and is laid out in regular order the &s;treets in|ter&s;ecting each other. The rules and regulations, which are printed and put up in different parts of the encampment, do honour to the heads and hearts of the committee. The entire prohibition of &s;pi|ritous liquors, except in ca&s;es of real nece&s;&s;ity, is a &s;triking feature in tho&s;e excellent rules; in &s;hort, they have e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;y&s;tematical police.&mdash;They puni&s;h &s;light offences by withholding the provi&s;ions for a rea&s;onable time, and for tho&s;e more aggrava|ted, they expel the offender. All intercour&s;e with the city is cut off (except on &s;pecial occa&s;ions) which is enforced by placing &s;entinels at proper di&s;tances around the encampment, who do not permit any per&s;on to pa&s;s or repa&s;s, by night or day, without leave from one of the committee or &s;teward. Sca|vengers are al&s;o appointed, who&s;e duty it is every morning to remove all the filth and to throw fre&s;h earth into the nece&s;&s;aries. The people are compel|led to expo&s;e their bedding to the &s;un and air at lea&s;t three times a week, and to wa&s;h their cloathing frequently.</P>

The mo&s;t &s;crupulous regard to ju&s;tice is ob&s;erved in the di&s;tribution of the provi&s;ions, which are of an excellent quality, and &s;erved out in abundance.&mdash;The &s;trict decorum that has been &s;o eminently main|tained in the encampment, among&s;t characters too, &s;ome of whom are no doubt very abandoned, de|mon&s;trate the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous attention in the com|mittee as well as &s;uperior addre&s;s.</P>

<P>A letter to the Editor of the Chro. from Phila. mentions, "that in that city and New-York, 21 printers have fallen vactims to the terrible calamity which has de&s;olated tho&s;e places. To what cau&s;e to attribute this uncommon mortality, puzzles many&mdash;but in my opinion," adds our corre&s;pondent, "it has ari&s;en from &s;o large a number deeming it their duty to be found at their po&s;ts: while mo&s;t other profe&s;&s;ions fled. I know nothing peculiarly attrac|tive of di&s;ea&s;e in the materials u&s;ed in printing-offi|ces&mdash;but as nothing but flight can &s;ave, if it appears at another &s;ea&s;on, I &s;hall con&s;ider it a bounden duty to avoid it."</P>

<P>If I am not unaccountably deceived, the pre&s;ent prevailing fever, in many re&s;pects, bears a great re|&s;emblance to the &s;mall-pox. They are both more malignant in &s;ome con&s;titutions than others; they are both le&s;s fatal to children and the generality of women than to men. They are both more fatal to men addicted to intemperate and voluptuous living; the gro&s;s and the corpulent, than to temperate li|vers, who are engaged in active occupations.</P>
<P>Hence like &s;mall pox, the preparation requi&s;ite to render the di&s;ea&s;e mild and &s;afe, mu&s;t vary with the temperament and con&s;titution of each individu|al.</P>
<P>Where the inflammatory diathe&s;is predominates, which is commonly the ca&s;e in children from two to twelve years of age, and to young per&s;ons accu&s;|tomed to activity in the open air, mercury is not a proper preparative; but in all ca&s;es where the want of vigour is manife&s;t, and a di&s;po&s;ition to di&s;ea&s;es of debility, or the nervous type, are evident, mercury, and in &s;uch manner as not to evacuate much, in all probability mu&s;t be among the fir&s;t preparatives to be found in the Materia Medica. In the cure, I am certain it can only be employed with &s;afety and with efficacy, in ca&s;es where the inflammatory diathe&s;is, is not con&s;iderable; or in ca&s;es of nervous and &s;ep|tic tendency,</P>
<P>The incautious and too copious employment of mercury has in &s;everal in&s;tances been followed by the mo&s;t deplorable effects. In &s;ome ca&s;es it has occa&s;ioned not only the lo&s;s of teeth, but of part of the jaw bone. In &s;ome, a rigid contraction of the lower jaw&mdash;a gangrene of, and con&s;equent lo&s;s

of part of one of the cheeks&mdash;the ton&s;ils and palate&mdash;lo&s;s of &s;peech, &amp;c. The &s;phacelus and con&s;e|quent ero&s;ions in &s;ome ca&s;es have been followed by profu&s;e di&s;charges of blood, which have put a &s;pee|dy period to the patient's life. The&s;e facts are mentioned to put le&s;s experienced phy&s;icians upon their guard, and to prevent them from acting like the Hungarian phy&s;icians, mentioned by Kramer and Lind, who, becau&s;e they had &s;een beneficial ef|fects from mercury in &s;yphilitic ulcers, could not be per&s;uaded that it would not have a &s;imilar affect in ca&s;es of &s;curvy, but gave it to 400 patients and kill|ed them to a man.</P>

<P>HAVING in the preceding Memoirs, noted the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and fatal effects of the fever, lately prevalent in this city, and other parts of this country, (the contagious nature of which is acknowledged by all, excepting a few per&s;ons that are di&s;tingui&s;hed for nothing but the &s;ingularity of their opinions, and a pertinacious adherence to a tenet, which both by the illu&s;trations of rea&s;oning and the common &s;en&s;e of their fellow citizens, has been declared ab&s;urd and utenable.) I &s;hall now pro|ceed to &s;tate &s;uch evidence as has come to my know|ledge, re&s;pecting the origin of the di&s;ea&s;e, the cer|tainty of which is of the highe&s;t importance to the future intere&s;t and pro&s;perity of this country in ge|neral, and to Philadelphia in particular.</P>
<P>Certain circum&s;tances having given ri&s;e to a &s;u&s;|picion that the contagion which gave origin to the di&s;ea&s;e was imported in the &s;hip Deborah, which arrived at Philadelphia, from Jeremie, and anchor|ed near Race &s;treet wharf, on the 18th of July. I made every enquiry in my power into the &s;ubject with a view of a&s;certaining the truth.</P>
<P>The death of the Marquis de Rouvray, imme|diately after her arrival&mdash;of a boy that belonged to her a few days after,&mdash;of a labouring man that had worked on board her&mdash;and of Alexander Philips, who had been down to her in a boat, while &s;he was performing quarantine, and who died on the 5th of Augu&s;t.&mdash;The &s;ickne&s;s of a carpenter on the 26th of

July at Achi&s;on Thomp&s;on's next door to Philips's, who had been on board the Deborah while un&s;hip|ping her cargo,&mdash;the &s;udden death of a &s;ailor in the &s;ame hou&s;e on the 28th of July, and, the numerous ca&s;es in the neighbourhood of Philip's and Thomp|&s;on's a few days after, not only increa&s;ed, but direc|ted the &s;u&s;picions of all that were acquainted with the&s;e circum&s;tances, to the &s;hip Deborah.</P>
<P>It appears from facts collected by Dr. Daniel De Beneville, and communicated in writing to Dr. Grif|fitts, that the fir&s;t per&s;on that had the yellow fever in Ken&s;ington, (to which place the Deborah had re|moved for the purpo&s;e of undergoing repairs on the 28th. of July), was a lad of the name of Jo&s;eph Streeton, that had been on board of her while &s;he lay in the city&mdash;This lad was taken &s;ick on the 29th, of July and died the 3d of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>James Porter, apprentice to Jo&s;eph Grice, &s;hip carpenter, next door to Streeton's, was taken with the fever on the 1&s;t. of Augu&s;t, and died on the twelfth.</P>
<P>James A&s;hmore, an apprentice to Wm. Yard, &s;hip carpenter, who had worked on board the De|borah, while &s;he lay in the city was attacked with the fever, on the 2d. of Augu&s;t, and died on the fifteenth.</P>
<P>James Kerr, George Adams, and one Simons, all apprentices to Wm. Yard, worked on board the Deborah, and were all taken &s;ick a few days after James A&s;hmore, and all recovered.</P>
<P>Two labouring men, who worked on board the Deborah, were taken &s;ick on the 3d. of Augu&s;t, one died, the other recovered. Samuel Baker, Dr. De Beneville, his wife and hou&s;e keeper, who re&s;ided near the wharf where the Deborah lay, were all attacked with the fever, in the cour&s;e of a week after her arrival at Ken&s;ington; and before the mid|dle of Augu&s;t the whole neighbourhood was infected.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="033589_0133_0FF793917B217B50">
That the Deborah was an infected ve&s;&s;el, appears evident, from the te&s;timony of her mate, Mr. John Lewis, the carpenter that was with her, during the whole voyage, the cook, &s;everal &s;eamen, and a pa&s;&s;enger of the name of Dicki&s;on&mdash;all of whom agree, that &s;he lo&s;t &s;even per&s;ons with a fever, on her pa&s;&s;age from Jeremie, to Philadelphia, and five of her crew, while in the port of Jeremie.&mdash;Mr. Lewis the mate of the Deborah, informed me in pre&s;ence of two witne&s;&s;es that the Deborah had been employed as a tran&s;port for the Briti&s;h troops at St. Domingo, for &s;ome time previous to her taking in her cargo, at Jeremie.</P>
<P>Dr. Wi&s;tar, was informed by the cooper; of the deaths on board, and the carpenter, John Bodin's depo&s;ition was taken by the mayor of Burlington.</P>
<P>Captain Yard, him&s;elf &s;ometime after his arrival in Philadelphia, in conver&s;ation with a gentleman who&s;e te&s;timony may be relied on, acknowledged that while the Deborah lay at Jeremie, a very mor|tal di&s;ea&s;e was prevalent there, which the natives called the Malad, de Siam, of which the captain, and the chief part of the crew of an Engli&s;h &s;hip from Liverpool, died, and the re&s;t were &s;o terrified that they de&s;erted the &s;hip.</P>
<P>When the Deborah arrived at the Health-Office near the fort, with about an hundred per&s;ons on board including pa&s;&s;engers,&mdash;two of the &s;eamen who appeared to be in a convale&s;cent &s;tate, were taken to the Marine Ho&s;pital, and a black woman.</P>
<P>The&s;e men Mr. Lewis &s;ays, were in the city be|fore the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Atchi&s;on Thomp&s;on and Mr. Doyle, neighbours to Philips when he was alive, &s;olemnly declare that Philips brought a man belonging to the Debo|rah to his hou&s;e, before the arrival of the &s;hip.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Griffitts pre&s;cribed for one of the crew of the Deborah at Phil|ips's while he lay ill who had taken lodgings there 24th of July. The phy|&s;ician of port informed the college of phy&s;icians, that one of the crew of the Deborah died at the Marine Ho&s;pital; and that two pilots, that conducted the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">al and the Aurora, died there about the &s;ame time.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="033589_0134_0FF7939543B9D3B0">
The &s;ize and martial appearance of the Deborah, (for &s;he carried &s;everal guns) led a number of young men and boys to vi&s;it her; among, others, was a lad of the name of James Wright, and a young man belonging to Mr. Clemens. The former lived in Water above Che&s;nut &s;treet, the latter in Third near Walnut &s;treet, one of the&s;e was attacked the 30th, the other the 31&s;t of July. The latter died on the 6th day from the attack, the former recovered.</P>
<P>As the di&s;ea&s;e appeared about this time in different parts of the city, which had been uncommonly healthy all the preceding &s;ea&s;on, it is probable that others &s;uffered from the like incon&s;iderate curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>From the&s;e as from a focus, it gradually diverged over the whole city.</P>
<P>A Brig from Jamaica, with Coffee, &s;ome of which was damaged, arrived at Mr. Ro&s;s's wharf, in the neighbourhood where the di&s;ea&s;e made its fir&s;t and mo&s;t formidable a&s;&s;ault, on the 29th of July, but as the di&s;ea&s;e had made &s;ome progre&s;s before that date, there can be no room for &s;u&s;pecting that to have given origin to it. Be&s;ides there are no facts in proof of a fever of a contagious kind ever having been produced either by damaged vegetables or by the exhalations from bilge water, as I have &s;ufficiently &s;hewn in my Ob&s;ervations on the Cau&s;e and Cure of Bilious Fevers, publi&s;hed la&s;t year.</P>
<P>But that the contagion which gives ri&s;e to &s;uch a fever as the one under con&s;ideration, may be re|tained in an active &s;tate, in the clothing of the&s;e that have been &s;ick or that have died of it, for &s;eve|ral weeks if excluded from fre&s;h air, is well known to tho&s;e conver&s;ant with medical hi&s;tory.</P>

of the late learned Dr. Mead, that a &s;ack of infected cotton imported into Bermudas in the year 1695. gave origin to a fever &s;o malignant, that the living &s;carcely &s;ufficed to bury the dead. It is al&s;o record|ed, that the impri&s;oned &s;eeds of a pe&s;tilential fever, which depopulated Mar&s;eilles in the year 1720, made their e&s;cape from a &s;ailor's bundle, lately arrived from the Levant.</P>
<P>The importation of the contagion which gave ri&s;e to the plague in London in the year 1665, and al|mo&s;t depopulated that city in the cour&s;e of the &s;um|mer and autumnal months, is a fact too notorious to expatiate upon. A &s;imilar fever, which de&s;troyed 80,000 of the inhabitants of Mo&s;cow and the adja|cent villages in 1771, was introduced by Turki&s;h pri&s;oners, as appears from the account of Mertins, one of the phy&s;icians appointed by the empre&s;s to attend the infected. This fever, like the one with which we have been vi&s;ited, yielded to the power of fro&s;t. We have the authority of the experienced Lind, that the yellow fever was introduced into Phi|ladelphia in the year 1741 by a trunk of infected cloathing received from Barbadoes; and of Dr. Lining, that every time it had appeared in Charle&s;|ton, it had been traced to &s;ome per&s;on or ve&s;&s;el re|cently arrived from the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>The yellow fever which prevailed in New-Haven in the year 1794, was traced to imported contagion, as appears from the &s;tatement of Dr. Mon&s;on, pub|li&s;hed in Web&s;ter's collection of papers on bilious fevers. For more examples of the &s;ame kind, I refer to a book which I publi&s;hed la&s;t year, entitled, "Ob&s;er|vations on the Cau&s;es and Cure of Bilious Fevers."</P>
<P>The introduction of the di&s;ea&s;e into Che&s;ter, Marcus-Hook and Wilmington, &s;oon after its ap|pearance in Philadelphia, are additional proofs in &s;upport of the opinion that the late fever was derived from imported contagion.</P>

A lad belonging to John Wood, a potter, who had &s;lept two nights on board a &s;hallop employed in trading to Philadelphia a &s;hort time before he was taken ill, was the fir&s;t that died of the yellow fever in Che&s;ter, and he died on the 31&s;t day of July.&mdash;Another lad that had &s;lept on board the &s;ame &s;hal|lop with Mr. Wood's lad, was taken ill the &s;ame day but recovered in the cour&s;e of a week. The one that died had the black vomit, and his corp&s;e became very yellow.</P>
<P>Seven days after the decea&s;e of the fir&s;t mention|ed lad, his mother and brother were both attacked with fever, and the brother was buried 11 days af|ter.</P>
<P>William Siddons, jun. who had &s;et up with the fir&s;t mentioned lads during their illne&s;s, was taken with the fever on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, and died the 8th. Charles Warrick, who had al&s;o vi&s;ited them, was attacked with fever the 4th of Augu&s;t and di|ed the 9th. Abby Engle, who lived next door to Siddons, died the 16th of Augu&s;t. Je&s;&s;e Bicker|ton, at who&s;e hou&s;e Abby Engle died, was attacked a few days after her decea&s;e, on board his &s;hallop at the Fort, and died on the 28th of Augu&s;t. After the fir&s;t of September, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread into every part of that village, which contained but about 50 families, and before it cea&s;ed, de&s;troyed 50 per&s;ons, &s;everal of whom were of the fir&s;t note in the place; though it was gradually de&s;erted by all, excepting &s;ix or &s;even families.

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Dr. Sayres, dated Marcus Hook, November, 24, 1798.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t ca&s;e of yellow fever, that came under my notice in Marcus Hook, was on Augu&s;t 2d. 1798. This was a &s;hallop man, who came from Philadelphia, four days previous to the attack of the Fever&mdash;he died, the 6th. day of the di&s;ea&s;e, with the highe&s;t &s;ymptoms of putre&s;cency. The next five ca&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e, were per&s;ons, who were but a few days from Philadelphia, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> from two to eight days. The di&s;ea&s;e, appeared to increa&s;e con&s;ider|ably in this place, and in Che&s;ter, by the 20th. of Augu&s;t; The &s;ymptoms on the fir&s;t attack, were more &s;trongly marked&mdash;and the proportionate number of deaths, were much increa&s;ed by the fir&s;t of September. The number of ca&s;es which came under my notice from the &s;econd day of Augu&s;t, until the 26th. of October, was eighty two&mdash;Fifty-&s;even of the&s;e, died.</P>
<P>The greater part of tho&s;e, who were lately from Philadelphia, died between the &s;econd and the &s;ixth day after their attack. The inhabitants of this place and Che&s;ter, who had the di&s;ea&s;e, and had not been in Philadelphia, recovered in greater proportion.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e appeared, in a number of ca&s;es, evi|dently communicated by contagion&mdash;in &s;ome ca&s;es from the &s;ick&mdash;and &s;everal ca&s;es from the bed linen, &amp;c.&mdash;Though in a con&s;iderable number of ca&s;es, which &s;peedily terminated fatally, I was not able to trace the &s;malle&s;t ve&s;tige of contagion, being pre|viou&s;ly applied, or received.</P>
<P>Free and copious bleeding was made u&s;e of in the fir&s;t &s;tage with evident advantage in mo&s;t ca&s;es. We bled in very few in&s;tances, with &s;ucce&s;s, after forty eight hours from the attack of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="033589_0138_0FF77DF1F149EF68">
The greate&s;t number of &s;ucce&s;sful ca&s;es, were, where free bleeding was in&s;tantly u&s;ed, before the fever had continued many hours; and immediately followed by a free u&s;e of calomel, &amp;c. &s;o as to ope|rate very freely and copiou&s;ly upon the alimentary canal, and free &s;weating afterwards. In general, our ca&s;es terminated unfortunately, except we found &s;alutary &s;ymptoms appear in &s;ixty hours from the attack.</P>
<P>Bli&s;ters were u&s;ed freely, after &s;ymptoms of high debility took place&mdash;and in &s;ome ca&s;es with mani|fe&s;t advantage. In no in&s;tance that I &s;aw, was bleeding &s;ucce&s;sful, after two days and an half&mdash;but when u&s;ed in a few of &s;uch ca&s;es, it appeared evidently to &s;ink the patient and to ha&s;ten his death.</P>
<P>We u&s;ed bark, wine, and a number of the com|mon &s;timulants, on the fir&s;t appearance of debility taking place; but with little &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Finding the common round, of medicine, prove &s;o ineffectual in the advanced &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, I determined to u&s;e a different mode of treatment&mdash;in three ca&s;es of adults, two of which had the black vomiting on them, and the third, was in a gore of putrid blood from the mouth and no&s;e. I forbid medicine, and directed very cold water and brandy mixed &s;trong, to be given freely as po&s;&s;ible:&mdash;It had the happy effect of checking the puking in the two ca&s;es, when the &s;tomach had rejected every kind of mild drink, &amp;c. and by continuing that practice, almo&s;t &s;o as to produce high intoxication, for two or three days, tho&s;e two ca&s;es, were recover|ed almo&s;t from a &s;tate of death. The third ca&s;e, was much benefited apparently for three days&mdash;but, be|ing in a high putre&s;cent &s;tate when I went fir&s;t to &s;ee him, and having lo&s;t a very con&s;iderable quantity of blood from the mouth, no&s;e, &amp;c. his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e proved unfortunate on the ninth day.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="033589_0139_0FF793A0BA3BD258">
There was a number of &s;eamen died here, with the di&s;ea&s;e, though from no &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el, (except|ing the Ganges) more than two or three.</P>
<P>"We were &s;eldom able to produce ptyali&s;m, be|fore the di&s;ea&s;e terminated fatally.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Wilmington, <DATE>November 13, '98.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE fir&s;t ca&s;e of yellow fever which happened in Wilmington, this &s;ea&s;on, was in the per&s;on of one of the inhabitants of the borough, who caught it in Philadelphia about the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, &s;ickened on the road home, and died &s;oon after. The contagi|on was not communicated from this ca&s;e. The Philadelphians flocked in upon us immediately af|terwards. I vi&s;ited a young man from Philadelphia, in the fever, on the 10th of the &s;ame month. This man was among the fir&s;t, if not the very fir&s;t, that was &s;ent to our newly in&s;tituted Ho&s;pital. The fe|ver became epidemic between the 15th and 20th.&mdash;It commenced with per&s;ons immediately from Phila|delphia, as well inhabitants of the borough, as of the city. Shallop-men and others, who pa&s;&s;ed from one place to the other, by water, were the fir&s;t victims. From the&s;e it extended rapidly to the inhabitants of fixed re&s;idence. A &s;hip manned chiefly by French royali&s;ts, that entered our port after the &s;ickne&s;s had
<PB N="139" REF="033589_0140_0FF793A252185EB8">
commenced, was al&s;o &s;u&s;pected of contributing to the evil; but of this I have no evidence. From all the information that came to my knowledge, every phy&s;ician of this place, and all others of correct ob|&s;ervation agree, that the di&s;ea&s;e was imported to us from Philadelphia, by infected goods and furniture, as well as infected per&s;ons. We &s;uppo&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e to be propagated by contagion, from infected per|&s;ons, cloathing, ve&s;&s;els, hou&s;es, &amp;c. It is remark|able, however, that &s;tronger exhalations ari&s;e from per&s;ons affected by this fever, than in other fe|brile di&s;ea&s;es; and we have rea&s;on to believe that many were affected by the contagion, at a di&s;tance from the &s;ick reaching quite acro&s;s our &s;treets. No in&s;tance of tho&s;e who &s;led to the country communi|cating it to others, has come to my knowledge with|in the vicinity of Wilmington. It is &s;aid that in|&s;tances of this &s;ort have happened at Marcus-Hook and other places; but for the&s;e I cannot vouch.</P>
<P>In another letter I &s;hall be ambitious to make &s;ome compen&s;ation for your former valuable favour to me, by a few ob&s;ervations, particularly on the cholera infantum, that may not be unacceptable to you: for you will admit, that the Delaware phy&s;i|cians ought to be of authority in bilious di&s;orders.</P>

<P>Dr. Monro's letter of the 19th November, con|firms Dr. Tilton's account of the time <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> manner of the introduction of the di&s;ea&s;e into Wilmington, and of its being afterwards communicated by the inhabitants of fixed re&s;idence, from one to another.</P>

"A man who had been to the city to rent a hou&s;e in that part of the city where the di&s;ea&s;e occa|&s;ioned the fir&s;t alarm, and had been on board an in|fected ve&s;&s;el, was taken &s;ick on his return to Wil|mington, and died &s;oon after his arrival there, with &s;ymptoms of confirmed yellow fever."</P>
<P>"One half of all the &s;ick that were &s;ent to the tents died." This Dr. Monro a&s;cribes to the ab&s;o|lute interdection of the u&s;e of mercury there. In his own-practice, no per&s;on died after &s;alivation came on, nor did he know of an in&s;tance, under the care of any other phy&s;ician in that place.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was not con&s;tantly the ca&s;e in Philadelphia.</NOTE> "The di&s;ea&s;e was &s;en&s;ibly checked &s;oon after the cold wea|ther, which occurred the latter end of September; revived with the returning warm weather, but was entirely extingui&s;hed by the 3rd of November."</P>
<P>It is now known that a lad of the name of Dag|get, was attacked with the yellow fever the 26th of July, on board the &s;chooner John, from Bo&s;ton, which lay at Ro&s;s and Simp&s;on's wharf, a little way below Walnut-&s;treet. Mr. Lloyd and his clerk had been on board of her a few days before their attack; and a woman and two of the hands died (according to the report of the ma&s;ter to Dr. Dor&s;ey) on her outward pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>An unan&s;werable argument that the fever did not originate from dome&s;tic cau&s;es, is afforded by the exemption of Baltimore, Georgetown, Alexandria, Norfolk, Wilmington, (N. C.) Charle&s;ton, and Sa|vannah.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e this year prevailed, and was attended with a degree of mortality unexampled in this coun|try, (con&s;idering the comparative &s;mallne&s;s of the number that remained within the &s;phere of the con|tagion)

in all the commercial towns north of Balti|timore; whereas all the commercial towns south of Baltimore have e&s;caped, Peter&s;burg excepted, and the di&s;ea&s;e was introduced into Peter&s;burg by the &s;hip Ne&s;tor from Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible to believe, that the late fever, (which is con&s;idered by the advocates for its dome&s;tic ori|gin, to be only a higher grade of the common bili|ous fever which appears in low mar&s;hy countries every &s;ummer and autumn) could originate and be|come epidemic on the high, dry and &s;andy banks of Ken&s;ington? in the paved, clean and open &s;treets of Philadelphia, where every wind that blows has a free cour&s;e? on the high and gravelly hills of Wil|mington? on the elevated &s;hores of York, wa&s;hed on either &s;ide by Ocean's briny waves? and not make its appearance on the flats of Baltimore, or the putrid fens of Charle&s;ton and Savannah, where bile flows in ince&s;&s;ant &s;treams; and where the debilitated inhabitants faint under the in&s;ufferable blaze of a vertical &s;un?</P>
<P>If the united opinion of a number of men of the fir&s;t abilities and mo&s;t exten&s;ive profe&s;&s;ional know|ledge be of authority on the pre&s;ent intere&s;ting que&s;|tion, that of the College of Phy&s;icians, pre&s;ented la&s;t year to the Legi&s;lature, ought to be admitted: the &s;ub&s;tance of which follows. The College is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;till &s;tronger facts and documents in &s;upport of their opinion this year.</P>
<P>"The College is of opinion, that the yellow fever is derived from imported contagion. For this opi|nion they a&s;&s;ign the following among other rea&s;ons: "The di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion is e&s;&s;entially different from the fevers that occur in this climate, and which ori|ginate from dome&s;tic cau&s;es. It al&s;o differs e&s;&s;enti|ally from them in the circum&s;tance of being conta|gious; a bilious fever originating from dome&s;tic
<PB N="142" REF="033589_0143_0FF793AAAE2AF840">
cau&s;es having never been to our knowledge contagi|ous in this climate."</P>
<P>And that the yellow fever, which has committed &s;uch deplorable ravages in different commercial ci|ties of the&s;e &s;tates, &s;ince the year 1793, was not de|rived from the exhalations of putrid vegetable &s;ub|&s;tances, which occa&s;ion intermitting, remitting, or bilious fevers, but was of pe&s;tilential origin, is fully e&s;tabli&s;hed by the facts publi&s;hed in the year 1795, by Dr. Chi&s;holm, &s;urgeon-general to the Ordinance in the We&s;t-India I&s;lands, to which valuable publi|cation the reader is referred.</P>

PRESUMING that the public mind will no longer be held in &s;u&s;pen&s;e re&s;pecting the origin of the fatal malady by which the fair pro&s;|pects, of this, and other commercial cities, in this country, have been repeatedly bla&s;ted; I tru&s;t the legi&s;lature, the enlightened guardians of the public welfare, will proceed, without delay, to e&s;tabli&s;h more effectual rules, than tho&s;e, at pre&s;ent exi&s;ting, to prevent the future return of the awful calamity.</P>
<P>Supinene&s;s or an ill judged par&s;imony on the pre|&s;ent intere&s;ting occa&s;ion, would force commerce to de&s;ert our coa&s;ts, and involve the inhabitants of our cities, in ab&s;olute ruin, which would &s;oon be followed by that of agriculture, for the exi&s;tence of the one, is nece&s;&s;ary to that of the other.</P>
<P>It has lately been propo&s;ed by a re&s;pectable com|mittee of the inhabitants of this city, to petition either for an intire interdiction of the We&s;t India trade, during the &s;ummer, and autumnal months, or, (if that &s;hould be thought too great a &s;acrifice), for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch quarantine rules, as &s;hall effectually preclude the introduction of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>To effect this de&s;irable purpo&s;e, I beg leave to recommend the rules publi&s;hed in the Gazette of the United States, of the 21&s;t of September, &s;igned, <HI>Mentor;</HI> and to prevent it from &s;preading when introduced, I believe the rules with the &s;ame &s;ignature publi&s;hed in the Gaz. of the U. S. of Septr. 25th or 26th, if &s;trictly complied with, will
<PB N="144" REF="033589_0145_0FF793AE1DAD9478">
always be found effectual. Similar rules were put in practice with the mo&s;t happy effects, the pre&s;ent year, not only in the Penn&s;ylvania Ho&s;pital, by Mr. Samuel Coats, who re&s;ided there, during the con|tinuance of the fever, and in the Alms-Hou&s;e, by Mr. Cummins, and Dr. James, where the pen|&s;ioners and orphans were numerous, but in the pri&s;on for convicts, under the direction of the American Howard, who took his re&s;idence in that dreary and dangerous abode, about the 20th. of September, at which time the di&s;ea&s;e had made con|&s;iderable havoc among tho&s;e wretched votaries of rapine and di&s;order.</P>
<P>The number of male convicts confined in the pri|&s;on at that time was about 140; The females were le&s;s numerous.</P>
<P>The vagrants and untried criminals had been re|moved.</P>
<P>The males and females were confined in &s;eparate, and di&s;tant wings of the pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Eighteen of the male criminls, on account of their late in&s;urrection, were confined in dungeons; the remainder occupied different apartments on the &s;ame floor.</P>
<P>Several of the men were ill of the fever at that time. The women were all in health, and continu|ed in that condition during the whole time that the di&s;ea&s;e prevailed in the city.</P>
<P>A ward in the Ea&s;t wing was immediately appro|priated for the reception of the &s;ick, who were &s;e|parated from the &s;ound, and every nece&s;&s;ary accom|modation provided for them. The&s;e were attended by Dr. Benjamin Duffield. A &s;eparate apartment was provided for the convale&s;cents. More nutriti|ous aliment than they had been accu&s;tomed to, (for they had been allowed for many days only &s;ufficient food to prevent them from fami&s;hing) with a
<PB N="145" REF="033589_0146_0FF793B36E8437E8">
&s;mall allowance of claret, was di&s;tributed among tho&s;e that had hitherto e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e, but every kind of exce&s;s and irregularity di&s;countenanced and prohibited.</P>
<P>A quantity of green wood was removed from the yard, as well as cart loads of dirt, litter and every putrifiable material that could be di&s;covered; the ob&s;tructed channel opened for the pa&s;&s;age of the wa|ter; the pavement kept continually wet and cool, by means of the pump; the vegetables along the wall cheri&s;hed; the occupation of &s;tone-&s;awing carried on; cleanline&s;s was &s;trictly ob&s;erved; every Ward con&s;tantly ventilated, and the avoiding all intercour&s;e (this la&s;t by the direction of the phy&s;ician) earne&s;tly enjoined. By the&s;e means the di&s;ea&s;e was arre&s;ted in its progre&s;s, and in the cour&s;e of three weeks was entirely eradicated.</P>
<P>Let others profit by this example, and merit the benediction of an approving con&s;cience, &s;weeter than the plaudits of an admiring world.</P>
