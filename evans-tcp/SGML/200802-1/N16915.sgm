</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE entrance of Emmanuel into our world was fir&s;t announc|ed by an angel to &s;ome humble &s;hepherds. "I bring you," &s;aid the heavenly herald, "good tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to all people. For this day is born, in the city of David, a Saviour which is Chri&s;t the Lord&mdash;And &s;uddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly ho&s;t, prai&s;ing God, and &s;ay|ing, <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on earth peace, good will tow|ards men</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>When this &s;ermon was preached at New-Haven, the general di&s;tribution of the &s;ubject was thus introduced: "The &s;ub&s;tance of what will he offered to your con&s;ideration, was delivered a few days &s;ince to an</HI> epi&s;copal <HI>congregation, on occa&s;ion of the celebration of the nativity of Chri&s;t. But it is equally applicable to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The holy COMMUNION.</HI></NOTE>, <HI>and to profe&s;&s;or of all denominations.</HI></NOTE>."</P>
<P>We will con&s;ider, FIRST, the &s;ubject matter of this acclamation of the heavenly ho&s;t.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The foundation laid by the advent of the Saviour for the united acknowledgments of men and angels.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Recommend the &s;pirit of his religion, the prevalence of which would be mo&s;t happy for mankind on earth, and bring glory to God on high.</P>
<P>FIRST, Of the &s;ubject matter of this acclamation.</P>
<P>Here we may take a general &s;urvey of the Chri&s;tian in&s;titution, as a promulgation of peace to mankind in a &s;tate of apo&s;tacy. They are repre&s;ented as <HI>alienated, and enemies in their mind, with|out &s;trength, children of di&s;obedience,</HI> and con&s;equently <HI>of wrath.</HI> They therefore need reconciliation to God.&mdash;Nor le&s;s to one another. For unrenewed nature is thus de&s;cribed: <HI>Living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another; full of all unrighteou&s;|ness, malignity, and deceit.</HI> The old man, in di&s;tinction from &s;uch as are renewed in the &s;pirit of their mind, is known by pride, jealou|&s;y,
<PB N="6" REF="021783_0004_0FB74300ED38C840">
malice, revenge, and other unfriendly pa&s;&s;ions, the bane of &s;ociety, the &s;ource of private animo&s;ities and national wars. And even tho&s;e who have put off the old, and put on the new man, having remains of human depravity, experience and manife&s;t more or le&s;s of the carnal mind, which is enmity. "All have gone out of the way. There is not a ju&s;t man who doth good, and &s;inneth not."</P>
<P>THE exi&s;tence of the above alienation hath been, and is manife&s;t over all the earth: It is &s;uppo&s;ed in all tho&s;e &s;criptures which &s;peak of <HI>reconciliation for iniquity,</HI> and repre&s;ent Je&s;us Chri&s;t as <HI>our peace,</HI> coming into the world, and enduring the cro&s;s to re&s;tore peace on earth. God made man upright. He hath fallen from original rectitude. His glory is departed from him.</P>
<P>THE peace celebrated by angels, as in the text, denotes, fir&s;t, peace with GOD. He is reconciling the world to him&s;elf, not im|puting their tre&s;&s;pa&s;&s;es. He proclaimeth peace through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who knew no &s;in, and whom God hath &s;et forth to be a propitiation for it, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him. It is to the glory of God's <HI>grace,</HI> that he maketh us accepted in the beloved. He fir&s;t loved us, or no mediator would have been provided. Hence the ran&s;om Je&s;us paid is the <HI>effect,</HI> not the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of the love of God. In this greate&s;t gift of the Father's love, grace &s;uperabounds where &s;in abounded.</P>
<P>IN the parable of the prodigal &s;on, the father met the profli|gate while a great way off; fell on his neck, and ki&s;&s;ed him; put the be&s;t robe on him, and a ring on his finger, and &s;hoes on his feet, receiving him with every mark of paternal affection and joy. <HI>Such</HI> is the divine conde&s;cen&s;ion and compa&s;&s;ion to wandering, pe|ri&s;hing &s;inners. "He that &s;pared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how &s;hall he not with him al&s;o freely give us all things?" Let the glory of his grace be celebrated by heaven and earth. For if God be for us, who &s;hall be again&s;t us? No tempt|ation can happen to us above that we are able. All things &s;hall work together for good. Should any injure us in our outward in|tere&s;t, it will not be in their power to deprive us of the &s;pecial
<PB N="7" REF="021783_0005_0FB74304457212D0">
protection and &s;miles of a reconciled God. If not reconciled to him, what power can deliver us from his hand who is able to de|&s;troy &s;oul and body? Whom then would you fear? with whom would you be at peace?</P>
<P>FURTHER: The &s;acrifice of Je&s;us was a <HI>voluntary</HI> one. The Me&s;&s;iah, having a body prepared for him, "gave him&s;elf an offer|ing and &s;acrifice to God, and put away &s;in by the &s;acrifice of him|&s;elf. Lo, I come&mdash;I delight to do thy will, O my God. There is one Mediator between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all." How wonderful his friend&s;hip! "Though he was rich, for our &s;akes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his <HI>friends.</HI> But "when we were <HI>enemies,</HI> we were reconciled to God by the death of his &s;on."</P>
<P>CONSIDER how great HE was who undertook our redemption, and you cannot doubt but he was able to heal the breach the apo&s;tacy had made. Call to mind on this occa&s;ion the character given of him in prophecy. "Unto us a child is born, unto us a &s;on is given, and the government &s;hall be upon his &s;houlders: And his name &s;hall be called, WONDERFUL, COUNSELLER, THE MIGHTY GOD, THE EVERLASTING FATHER, THE PRINCE OF PEACE." He who was "&s;et up from everla&s;ting, by whom all things were made and con&s;i&s;t," who&s;e "glory was that of the only begotten of the Father, HE was made fle&s;h. The word, who was God," became incarnate: <HI>God was manife&s;t in the fle&s;h</HI>&mdash;This is a plain declaration of his divinity and humanity. Thus the prophet who foretold his miraculous conception: "Behold, a virgin &s;hall con|ceive, and bear a &s;on, and &s;hall call his name EMMANUEL." If &s;uch is the character of our redeemer, who will que&s;tion but he is <HI>mighty to &s;ave?</HI></P>
<P>FURTHER: The peace here proclaimed includes peace and good will among <HI>men.</HI> The example of our heavenly Father in&s;tructs us to love our enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e us, and do good to them that hate us. Our own forgivene&s;s is expre&s;sly &s;u&s;pended
<PB N="8" REF="021783_0006_0FB743056B621058">
on our imitation of the divine example. As a motive to &s;uch imitation, a compari&s;on is made of our offences again&s;t God with tho&s;e of our fellow-men again&s;t us. The former are &s;aid to be to the latter as ten thou&s;and talents to an hundred pence. The ex|ample of the author of our faith is a further motive to the exerci&s;e of forgivene&s;s. The&s;e are examples which can never be paralleled. Were we "followers of God as dear children;" did we "walk in love as Chri&s;t hath loved us," we &s;hould "put away all bitterne&s;s, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-&s;peaking, with all malice, and be kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another." The peculiar characteri&s;tics of <HI>the wi&s;dom from above</HI> are the&s;e: "Fir&s;t, pure, then peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocri&s;y." Tho&s;e whom the Saviour pronounceth ble&s;&s;ed, are, <HI>the poor in &s;pirit, the meek, the merciful, the peace-makers,</HI> &s;uch as can bear to be <HI>reviled and per&s;ecuted for righteou&s;|ne&s;s' &s;ake;</HI> &s;uch as forgive injuries to <HI>&s;eventy times &s;even;</HI>&mdash;who do not wait till the injurious a&s;k reconciliation, but prevent them by un&s;olicited propo&s;als of it, in imitation of the divine example. Did the principles and maxims of benevolence, inculcated by our re|ligion, rule in men's hearts, all unworthy emulations, all animo&s;i|ties and bitterne&s;s would cea&s;e. The members of a family, neigh|bourhood, civil or religious community would be <HI>of one heart and &s;oul.</HI> The &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity "beareth, hopeth, believeth all things, thinketh no evil, &s;eeketh not her own, envieth not, vaunt|eth not it&s;elf, is not puffed up." It worketh no ill to its neigh|bour; doth good to all as it hath opportunity; and, if po&s;&s;ible, lives peaceably with all men.</P>
<P>This may be <HI>impo&s;&s;ible.</HI> For &s;ome men would wre&s;t from others the liberty of judging and acting for them&s;elves, in a matter where|in every one mu&s;t &s;tand or fall to his own ma&s;ter, being account|able only to the &s;earcher of hearts. When men make their own &s;entiments the terms of &s;alvation, it may be impo&s;&s;ible to be on good terms with them, and yet have peace with God and their own con&s;ciences.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="021783_0007_0FB74306E352E860">
THERE doubtle&s;s are real Chri&s;tians in all communions, whether different communions acknowledge it, or not. In the exerc&s;e of Chri&s;tian charity the que&s;tion is not to what cla&s;s of profe&s;&s;ors a per&s;on belongs, but whether he is a real member of that kingdom which is righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace. Profe&s;&s;ors may agree by love to &s;erve one another, and unite their intere&s;t for the advancement of the kingdom of their common ma&s;ter, while they are be&s;t edified by a diver&s;ity of forms, have different views of &s;ome revealed truths, and different apprehen&s;ions as to &s;ome of the ways whereby Chri&s;|tianity may be be&s;t advanced. If, on account of &s;uch differences, or any of a like nature, they &s;eparate each other from the body of Chri&s;t, they <HI>know not what they do.</HI></P>
<P>THE church of Chri&s;t, in its exten&s;ive boundaries, needs the gifts of all the parts into which it is divided, and of every individ|ual of each denomination, as the natural body needs the concur|rence of all its members, in order to its beauty, health and growth. "For as the body is one, and hath many mem|bers, and all members have not the &s;ame office, <HI>&s;o al&s;o is Chri&s;t.</HI>" Hence it ill be|comes any denomination of Chri&s;tians to a&s;&s;ume the whole honour of &s;upporting Chri&s;tianity, or the reformation, even &s;uppo&s;e they may be viewed as eminent defenders of both. And it would as ill become any denomination to &s;uppo&s;e their own weight and influence &s;o incon&s;iderable, that it is of little con&s;equence how they demean them&s;elves. Various denominations &s;hould con&s;ider them&s;elves, and treat each other, as &s;everally and jointly &s;ub&s;ervient to the cau&s;e of the &s;ame Lord. They &s;hould excite each other to a laudable emulation, that through their united influence the go&s;pel may have free cour&s;e.</P>
<P>"LET every man be fully per&s;uaded in his own mind. Why do&s;t thou judge thy brother?" Had this advice been followed, the religion of the prince of peace would never have been improv|ed as an in&s;trument of di&s;cord and war. This was a con&s;equence, an unde&s;igned con&s;equence, of its e&s;tabli&s;hment. As its author
<PB N="10" REF="021783_0008_0FB743123622B038">
foretold, it &s;eparated neare&s;t friends, and proved an occa&s;ion of the &s;harpe&s;t conte&s;ts. This came to pa&s;s, however, through the ignorance, prejudices and lu&s;ts of men: It was not the con&s;e|quence of a right under&s;tanding of the go&s;pel, or of men's having the &s;pirit it inculcates; but the rever&s;e. Peace on earth, good will among men, are the legitimate fruits of this religion. Under its influence the &s;tate of this world would be that which we are taught to expect when "the knowledge of the Lord &s;hall fill the earth: They &s;hall not hurt nor de&s;troy in all God's holy moun|tain."</P>
<P>RELIGION mu&s;t be maintained under &s;ome form. This is indi&s;|pen&s;ible to the welfare of communities. In this view it will be the care of the magi&s;trate who &s;eeks the good of his people: At the &s;ame time it is the unalienable right of every individual to chu&s;e his own way of wor&s;hip. Particular forms do not open the king|dom of heaven to men, nor &s;hut that kingdom again&s;t them. "If any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his." Whoever hath this &s;pirit, is an heir of &s;alvation. Shame to the charity of &s;uch as will not allow it!&mdash;</P>
<P>WE have but one rule by which to judge whether men are Chri&s;|tians, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>by their fruits.</HI> And the fruits of Chri&s;tianity are "love joy, peace, long-&s;uffering gentlene&s;s, goodne&s;s, faith, meekne&s;s, temperance." Perfect unity in <HI>&s;entiment</HI> among the profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame religion is impo&s;&s;ible. They may yet be one in <HI>affection</HI>&mdash;may "keep the unity of the &s;pirit in the bond of peace," as the di&s;ciples of <HI>one Lord,</HI> who <HI>are called in one hope.</HI></P>
<P>THOSE who have &s;uch confidence in their own con&s;truction of the &s;criptures as to make it nece&s;&s;ary to all Chri&s;tians, have much occa&s;ion to con&s;ider our Lord's words re&s;pecting &s;uch as &s;aid, "Lo, here is Chri&s;t; or lo, he is there;" that is, here or there only. Our Lord &s;aid, "Go not after them; nor follow them." Hence we infer, either that they had not his pre&s;ence with them; or if they had, they yet knew not what &s;pirit they were of in de|nying
<PB N="11" REF="021783_0009_0FB742E757861840">
his pre&s;ence to be with others: Herein at lea&s;t they may not be imitated. This is a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of the Romi&s;h church; and it is doubtful whether infallibility it&s;elf can &s;upport the exclu&s;ive claim. For if her infallibility be not proved and known to <HI>others</HI> as well as <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> are others obliged to admit her faith? What effect hath it on that peace and good will which Chri&s;tianity inculcates? on brotherly kindne&s;s and charity? Com|pare Saul of Tar&s;us, making havoc of the church, with Paul the meek and humble apo&s;tle of Je&s;us, going every where in the ful|ne&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ing of the go&s;pel of peace. Thus the go&s;pel, thro' divine operation, takes from men the &s;pirit of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, and gives them a better mind.</P>
<P>OUR Lord rebuked the &s;pirit of the di&s;ciples who would have called for fire from heaven on the Samaritan village. The Sa|maritans would not receive him, becau&s;e he was going to Jeru&s;a|lem. The di&s;ciples wi&s;hed that the Samaritans might be in|&s;tantly con&s;umed. In both there was doubtle&s;s a mixture of an old national enmity. But Je&s;us came not to <HI>de&s;troy,</HI> but to <HI>&s;ave.</HI> Nor may his di&s;ciples con&s;ign one another over to the divine wrath, becau&s;e they have not attained to think alike. By &s;entiments of mutual re&s;pect, by imitating the virtues of their ma&s;ter, they would adorn the <HI>doctrine</HI> of our Saviour.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t give one who hath the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity an exalted plea&s;ure to be able to reflect, that his be&s;t endeavours have been u&s;ed to promote the great end of the incarnation of Chri&s;t. Compare the plea&s;ures of Chri&s;tian benevolence, which thinks and hopes the be&s;t of all men, is kindly affectioned, and, with brotherly love, in honor preferreth others, while all within its reach are the better for it&mdash;compare the &s;atisfaction &s;uch an one hath in him&s;elf, with the &s;pirit of bigotry and &s;u&s;picion&mdash;the &s;pirit which ab&s;olves or retains men's &s;ins according as they do or do not conform to us&mdash;the &s;pirit which loves, and doth good to tho&s;e only of <HI>one</HI> deno|mination. The former are <HI>perfect as our Father in Heaven.</HI> The
<PB N="12" REF="021783_0010_0FB74312E8CBAA20">
latter, whatever they imagine, have much rea&s;on to a&s;k, whether <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> love is any thing more than the intere&s;t of a party. Their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;&s;urance, their tru&s;ting in them&s;elves, and de&s;pi&s;ing others, is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> circum&s;tance in their favour. Error has u&s;ually more confi|dent and zealous advocates than the truth. The di&s;ciple of Je|&s;us "receiveth the Kingdom of God as a little child."</P>
<P>LASTLY, the peace our &s;ubject mentions includes peace in our <HI>con&s;ciences.</HI> The di&s;ciple of Je&s;us hath "joy and peace in believ|ing, and abounded in hope by the power of the Holy Gho&s;t." This is called "the love of God &s;hed abroad in the heart"&mdash;"the witne&s;s of the &s;pirit of God with theirs, that they the are children of God"&mdash;"the earne&s;t of the &s;pirit in their hearts." Hence their "fellow&s;hip is with the Father and Son." This "peace which pa&s;|&s;eth under&s;tanding," is doubtle&s;s comprehended in the peace for which the angelic ho&s;ts celebrated the prai&s;e of the MOST HIGH at the nativity of Chri&s;t. "Becau&s;e ye are &s;ons, God hath &s;ent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father." To accompli&s;h the end of his death, Je&s;us &s;ent the Spirit after his re|turn to heaven, for the conviction and conver&s;ion of unbelievers, and the confirmation and joy of believers unto life, that they might <HI>go on to perfection.</HI> The de&s;ign of the di&s;pen&s;ation of grace thro' a Mediator is thus expre&s;&s;ed: "The loftine&s;s of man &s;hall be bowed down, and the haughtine&s;s of men &s;hall be made low: and the Lord alone &s;hall be exalted in that day." When this de&s;ign is effected, through the power of the Spirit with the word, the alien|ation of the &s;inner is de&s;troyed. He commenceth an object of the &s;pecial love of God, an heir of &s;alvation. He "hath put off the old, and put on the new man." In the eternal coun&s;el of peace it plea&s;ed the Father to reconcile all things to him&s;elf by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The covenant of peace was between them. The cha&s;ti&s;e|ment of our peace was upon him. God now cond<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">nds to be&s;eech &s;inners to accept reconciliation in Chri&s;t. The &s;um of our mini&s;try is this: "Be ye reconciled to God." Angels mini&s;ter
<PB N="13" REF="021783_0011_0FB74317E76A9F38">
to men for this end. And the eternal Spirit operates with the means of grace. Hence "the weapons of our warfare are mighty to the pulling down of &s;trong holds." Not by human exertions; "but by my Spirit, &s;aith the Lord." The excellency of the pow|er is of God, that no fle&s;h &s;hould glory in his pre&s;ence. What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the &s;on of man, that thou vi&s;ite&s;t him?"</P>
<P>WE proceed to remark, SECONDLY, the foundation laid, by the advent of a Saviour, for the united acknowledgments of men and angels.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject of the united adoration and gratitude of the heav|enly ho&s;t at the nativity of Chri&s;t was this: <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</HI> Let earth join with heaven in this acclamation. Join in it this day, ye who ob|&s;erve the pre&s;ent &s;olemnity in commemoration of the birth of Chri&s;t. Ye who believe it to be the birth-day of your eternal hopes. So illu&s;trious a per&s;onage was never born into our world&mdash;one &s;o wor|thy to be remembered&mdash;one whom all men are commanded to honour, even as they ho|nour the Father.</P>
<P>WHETHER other worlds have fallen, and had a Redeemer provi|ded? or how far the angelic ho&s;t, who here celebrate the birth of the Redeemer of mankind, are intere&s;ted in his redemption? are que&s;tions which do not affect the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, nor do at all be|long to us. It is &s;ufficient that we know there is peace on earth through the interpo&s;ition of the Saviour, Chri&s;t the Lord&mdash;that &s;uperior intelligences give glory to God in the highe&s;t for this, and intere&s;t them&s;elves in what &s;o nearly concerns us. They were never alienated from God. They have always done his will with alacrity and zeal. Perfect harmony and love have reigned among them. They rejoice that peace is proclaimed to our fallen race, and de&s;ire to look into the &s;cheme of man's redemption: It is the &s;ubject of their adoration. There is joy among the&s;e be|nevolent &s;pirits at the conver&s;ion of every &s;inner on earth. They

cheerfully mini&s;ter for this purpo&s;e, that rebels may be reclaimed, and recovered &s;inners trained up to join them in the exerci&s;es and enjoyments of the world of perfect purity and love.</P>
<P>SHALL heaven be full of joy and prai&s;e, that God hath &s;ent his Son to our redemption? and &s;hall rebels and apo&s;tates be indiffer|ent to the proclamation of pardon, peace and glory? Is God pro|pitious? Will he accept repentance? Has he laid help on one that is mighty? Are the glad tidings publi&s;hed to us? Doth the offended maje&s;ty of heaven offer us full pardon un&s;olicited; and even intreat us to lay down our weapons of rebellion? Is he long-&s;uffering, not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h? Is the pro|clamation of peace unlimited, &s;o that who&s;oever will may &s;hare in it? What &s;hall we &s;ay? "Ble&s;s the Lord, O our &s;ouls! and all that is within us, ble&s;s his holy name." For he hath re|membered us in our low e&s;tate. "The day &s;pring from on high hath vi&s;ited us, and the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s ri&s;en upon us, to guide our feet in the way of peace. Sing, O ye heavens, for the Lord hath done it; &s;hout ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into &s;inging ye mountains, O fore&s;t, and every tree therein: for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified him&s;elf in I&s;rael, Ble&s;&s;ed are the people who know the joyful &s;ound: They &s;hall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.

<P>IF it be a&s;ked, What evidence have we that there was &s;uch a per|&s;on as Je&s;us born in the city of David, at the time we &s;uppo&s;e; who taught lived, and performed &s;uch works as never man did, died on the cro&s;s, and rose to immortal life? Our an&s;wer is the &s;ame evidence as we have for the exi&s;tence of any con&s;picuous charact|ers in antient hi&s;tory. Yea, more, if po&s;&s;ible: For be&s;ides the te&s;timonies of Chri&s;tian, Jewi&s;h and Pagan hi&s;torians to the life of Je&s;us, the accompli&s;hment of his prophecies in all ages &s;ince, and before the face of all people, undeniably proves, not only that there was &s;uch an illu&s;trious character at that time, but al&s;o that he was <HI>&s;ent of God.</HI></P>
<P>THE temple and city of Jeru&s;alem were laid in ruins about &s;eventeen hundred years ago, and have never been rebuilt, though Jews and heathen have united their efforts to defeat the prophecy of this de&s;olation. The cho&s;en people have ever &s;ince been &s;cat|tered over the face of the earth, and yet pre&s;erved as a di&s;tinct people; alike di&s;tingui&s;hed by univer&s;al approbrium, and by their malignity to the author of Chri&s;tianity. Con&s;ider their &s;tate at pre&s;ent, and ever &s;ince their de&s;olation. Were the&s;e things fore|told, and have they come to pa&s;s, without the determinate coun&s;el and providence of God? Hath this unexampled cha&s;ti&s;ement befallen them, becau&s;e they added to their other crimes this above all, that they crucified the LORD OF GLORY? Let &s;uch in the pre&s;ent age as deny the Lord that bought them, be warned. Let them &s;eek refuge in that Saviour whom they have pierced by their infidelity and other crimes. For <HI>there is no more &s;acrifice for &s;in.</HI></P>
<P>IF the whole hi&s;tory of Je&s;us is denied, let them &s;hew in what

<P>ST. PAUL inculcates Chri&s;tian union on the primitive converts by &s;uch con&s;iderations as the&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. XIV. <HI>pa&s;&s;im,</HI> and chap. XV. 1&mdash;7.</NOTE>. All profe&s;&s;ions are alike entitled to, and bound to exerci&s;e, private judgement. Tho&s;e who have the mo&s;t improved knowledge in Chri&s;tianity &s;hould bear with the prejudices of &s;uch as are le&s;s informed, and not plea&s;e them|&s;elves. All being accountable at the tribunal of God, all &s;hould beware left they invade his prerogative, by excluding their fel|low-di&s;ciplies from his mercy, becau&s;e of different opinions on unimportant points. A convention for forms &s;hould never be &s;o maintained as to bring into neglect and reproach things commend|able, and even e&s;&s;ential to all chri&s;tians. For the mo&s;t &s;pecious profe&s;&s;ors are nothing, if they have not charity, Hence a regard to the common cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, the purity and exten&s;ion of it, the union and edification of its di&s;ciples, &s;hould govern all who a&s;&s;ume the profe&s;&s;ion. For <HI>no man liveth to him&s;elf.</HI> By &s;uch con&s;iderations as the&s;e doth the apo&s;tle exhort to brotherly love&mdash;to peace with all men, and holine&s;s. On what other terms can we enjoy the God of peace, or the &s;ociety above who are made <HI>perfect in love.</HI></P>
<P>THE unexampled in&s;tance of humility and charity exhibited by the Lord of glory, when he took our nature upon him, inculcates on all his followers the mo&s;t un&s;eigned and fervent love to one another, and to mankind of every nation. This &s;pirit renders <HI>the righteous man more excellent than his neighbour.</HI> Tho&s;e e&s;pecially have engaged to cultivate and di&s;play it, who have <HI>fellow&s;hip in breaking of bread and prayer,</HI> in that in&s;titution which is the body and blood of Chri&s;t. Different denominations of profe&s;&s;ors, un|der the influence of this &s;pirit, will unite their endeavours for the
<PB N="17" REF="021783_0015_0FB7433295E4EB60">
purity and exten&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian religion, rejoicing in each other's gifts, and in the peace of the church.</P>
<P>IS this mind in us? Then our good wi&s;hes and earne&s;t pray|ers embrace men of every communion, nation and character; at the &s;ame time we feel a peculiar complacence in &s;uch as appear to have the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, whether they are of our per&s;ua&s;ion or not; whether near or remote; our own countrymen or foreigners. With all &s;uch we &s;hall mo&s;t cheerfully unite in the propagation of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>St. Paul has given us a particular de&s;cription of charity, 1 Cor. XIII. This is <HI>the more excellent way</HI> mentioned at the conclu&s;ion of chapter XII. Whoever compares the two chapters will plainly &s;ee, that <HI>&s;chi&s;m</HI> is the oppo&s;ite to charity. The &s;chi&s;matic div|ides the body of Chri&s;t: The &s;pirit of charity unites it. Schi&s;m|atics e&s;tabli&s;h this rule for the exci&s;ion of members:&mdash;We our|&s;elves are <HI>always</HI> right: They who <HI>differ</HI> from us are <HI>wrong;</HI> and therefore to be excluded from the communion of &s;aints.</P>
<P>OUR Lord forewarned his di&s;ciples, that they would meet with like treatment as he had, and by his own behaviour taught them a proper temper under it. "Who did no &s;in, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he &s;uffered, he threatened not; but committed him&s;elf to him that judgeth righteou&s;ly. Leaving us an example, that ye &s;hould follow his &s;teps. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but becau&s;e ye are not of the world, therefore the world hateth you," The Chri&s;tian therefore mu&s;t lay his account to &s;uffer wrongfully from the world. He forfeits his character, if he doth not arm him&s;elf with the &s;ame mind as was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, <HI>who endured the contradiction of &s;inners.</HI> A true di&s;ciple will &s;hew much conde&s;cen&s;ion for <HI>the go&s;pel's &s;ake,</HI> that oth|ers may partake of its ble&s;&s;ings with him. He will be patient in tribulation. He will walk in wi&s;dom towards them that are with|out. He will take care that there be no occa&s;ion of &s;tumbling in
<PB N="18" REF="021783_0016_0FB74333DDEE2F88">
him. Is this attended to by tho&s;e who are pertinacious and ob&s;ti|nate about <HI>meat and drink</HI>&mdash;the peculiarities of any one denomination; while <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace,</HI> the e&s;&s;entials of Chri&s;tiani|ty, are &s;acrificed?</P>
<P>THE Chri&s;tian will indeed obey God rather than men, though men &s;hould per&s;ecute him for obeying the dictates of his con&s;ci|ence. At the &s;ame time he will endeavour to recommend his profe&s;&s;ion to all men, by &s;hewing them, that LOVE, divine and &s;oci|al, is more than whole burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices&mdash;that <HI>faith worketh by love.</HI> Under the commanding influence of this &s;pirit, a fondne&s;s for di&s;criminating terms would be forgotten in a com|mon concern for Chri&s;tianity, and a common exertion again&s;t its foes. Thus our Lord prayed for his di&s;ciples. "That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they al&s;o may be one in us: <HI>that the world may believe that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me.</HI>" There would be no jar in families, no &s;chi&s;m in churches, no tu|mults in the &s;tate, were the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity imbibed. Dom|e&s;tic tranquility and love would ble&s;s every hou&s;e, alleviating ev|ery care, con&s;oling under every &s;orrow, giving a reli&s;h to every en|joyment. Kindred would be knit together, as David and Jona|than. Neighbours would be as brethren. It would be with king|doms as in the natural body, in which "the members have the &s;ame care one of another." Numerous as they are, and however various their office, "the eye doth not &s;ay to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Tho&s;e members which &s;eem to be more feeble are nece&s;&s;ary." Under the influence of this &s;pirit, nations would <HI>learn war no more.</HI> All would be content with their own rights, and fulfil their duty to others. Whatever different apprehen&s;ions there might be, any ill effects therefrom would be prevented. Yea, the&s;e would but di&s;play the Chri&s;tian &s;pirit to better advantage. The earth would be like heaven. What glory would be brought to God on high from the univer&s;al prevalence of this &s;pirit! What &s;hall we &s;ay more to recommend it?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="021783_0017_0FB7433EC5482470">
How much then is it to be lamented, that the &s;pirit of Chri&s;ti|anity has been departed from in all times and places, by tho&s;e who have profe&s;&s;ed a zeal for it? What cau&s;e have we to lay our hand upon our heart, and be deeply humbled that we are &s;o prone to animadvert with &s;everity on every mi&s;take and tre&s;pa&s;s of our bre|thren; while God in Chri&s;t is ever ready to bury in eternal oblivi|on our numberle&s;s and aggravated offences, and proclaimeth peace to all mankind? Dare we indulge hatred again&s;t another, while we glory in this, that the Son of the ble&s;&s;ed was born into our world, and endured the cro&s;s, to make reconciliation for our ini|quities? Shall we look for mercy from God, and yet &s;uffer one &s;un after another to go down upon our wrath again&s;t our brother? yea, one year after another to roll over, and our re&s;entment to continue unabated? Tho&s;e of whom this may be &s;aid, do not &s;urely give the be&s;t evidence that they them&s;elves are reconciled to God. In the day of judgment we &s;hall all have infinite need of mercy. Our hope that we &s;hall then find it, depends much on our loving mercy. <HI>The merciful &s;hall obtain mercy.</HI> Why then has peace been taken from the church and world, under pretence of <HI>contending for the faith?</HI> The con&s;equence of obedience to the faith would be, as we have &s;een, peace on earth, and good will among men. To this end Chri&s;t was born and came into the world. To this end he both died and revived.</P>
<P><HI>Many</HI> rejoiced at the birth of John, becau&s;e he prepared the way of the Lord. But the birth of Chri&s;t is matter of highe&s;t joy to <HI>all people.</HI> For all the ble&s;&s;ings of time and eternity are the purcha&s;e of his being made fle&s;h, and placing his delights with the &s;ons of men. "Ble&s;s the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in &s;trength; ye mini&s;ters of his that do his plea&s;ure"&mdash;But why call on the <HI>angels?</HI> They cea&s;e not day and night from celebrating the Redeemer.

He that is mighty hath done great things for our ruin|ed race. He hath not withheld his own Son from us. The Son of the ble&s;&s;ed "is our peace, having reconciled Jews and Gen|tiles unto God by the cro&s;s, having &s;lain the enmity thereby. Through him we have acce&s;s by one Spirit unto the Father." Joy to the world that Je&s;us reigns! May each of our hearts be his throne. We his amba&s;&s;adors pray you in his &s;tead, be ye recon|ciled to God.</P>
<P>EVERY intelligent and &s;erious Chri&s;tian will di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween a religious commemoration of the birth of Chri&s;t, and &s;uch exce&s;&s;es as have been common on this occa&s;ion. The Chri&s;|tian's joy in outward things is regulated by the rules of moral|ity, and the &s;uperior rules of &s;obriety and heavenly-mindedne&s;s in|culcated by the precepts and life of Je&s;us. He hath not forbid us to rejoice with our friends&mdash;to take our portion. But to rejoice in his &s;alvation is to &s;ee our own nece&s;&s;ities and his fulne&s;s; and to come to him as he inviteth all that labour and are heavy-laden, that we may find re&s;t to our &s;ouls.

So &s;hall we rejoice and be glad all our days. It comes recommended to all ages, and to all orders. It is alike adapted to public and private &s;tations, to high and low, rich and poor. Under its influence men will be faithful in little, and much; will po&s;&s;e&s;s the confidence of each o|ther, the approbation of their own minds, and of him with whom they have to do. It ends in glory honor and immorality. Would to God that &s;uch &s;entiments, and corre&s;pondent re&s;olutions, might be taken up on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion by old and young, and middleaged.</P>
