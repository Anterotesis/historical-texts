<BIBL>ECCLESIASTES iii, I5.</BIBL>
<Q>THAT WHICH HATH BEEN, IS NOW; AND THAT WHICH IS TO BE HATH ALREADY BEEN; AND GOD REQUIRETH THAT WHICH IS PAST.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is hard to find a more complicated charac|ter, in all the annals of time, than that of <HI>Solomon.</HI> The fir&s;t part of his life pre&s;ents us with the greate&s;t in&s;tance of human &s;agacity, and wi&s;dom, joined with a &s;pecial regard to religion and virtue, but a &s;econd part was filled up with luxury and wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE ju&s;t portrait we have of this complex character, not only exhibits the impartiality of the &s;acred hi&s;tory; but is joined with a di&s;play of infinite wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>GOD in his all wi&s;e providence, rai&s;ed <HI>Solomon,</HI> to the very &s;ummit or worldly glory. There was &s;carce a &s;ingle thing in all the rich variety of nature's garden, but he might pertake of at his plea&s;ure. But alas! in&s;tead of improving the mercies he had to the glory of that God from whom they came; he laid the reins on the neck of his lu&s;ts, and gave a loo&s;e to almo&s;t every vain de&s;ire. This conduct of <HI>Solomon</HI> appears the more exceedingly criminal, when we con&s;ider <HI>his</HI> exalted &s;tation in life, which gave <HI>him</HI> a &s;uperior influence among men.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="024126_0005_0FC3B5E31E681690">IT plea&s;ed the Lord however to magnify the infinite riches of his grace, in making this cele|brated king of I&s;rael, a true penitent for all his &s;in. This occa&s;ioned <HI>him</HI> to write the book, of which the words now read are a part. This in|deed contains as full, and ample a confe&s;&s;ion as any we &s;hall find extant upon earth.</P>
<P>BY this means the Lord has graciou&s;ly left a &s;acred record, a &s;tanding monitor to the world. By which we are a&s;&s;ured, that however great our abilities, however high our attainments in wi&s;|dom and knowledge; or if we are rai&s;ed to the &s;ummit of worldly honor and riches, yet that we are poor, fallible, changing creatures, whol|ly dependant on him that made us. By this we are a&s;&s;ured that all plans and &s;y&s;tems, founded in human wi&s;dom, however we may think them placed on a &s;ure ba&s;is, or arranged with the greate&s;t coherence; yet they are &s;ubject to er|ror.</P>
<P>IT is often that the turning of but one leaf in the book of divine providence, makes us &s;en|&s;ible, that the firmne&s;s of their foundation, is not &s;ufficient to di&s;&s;ipate our fears; or prevent the di&s;appointment of our mo&s;t &s;anguine expec|tations. Well did the prophet &s;ay, I&s;aiah ii.22 <HI>Cea&s;e from man, who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils: for wherein is he to be accounted of. Again</HI> P&s;alms xxxix, 5. <HI>Verily every man at his be&s;t e&s;tate, is al|together vanity.</HI> This king of I&s;rael, deeply &s;en&s;i|ble of this humiliating truth and the madne&s;s of his own &s;in and &s;olly while he anticipated the
<PB N="7" REF="024126_0006_0FC3B5E4D740AAD0">
&s;cene of trouble that mu&s;t come upon his fami|ly and &s;ubjects by his means; was led, in our context, particularly to warn others of the changing, fluctuating &s;tate, of all men and things, in this &s;inful world: and of the great nece&s;&s;ity of our engro&s;&s;ing in our affections &s;ome &s;uperior objects for delight.</P>
<P>ROVING in his thoughts, through the wild confu&s;ion, of a &s;inful world; he at length found the de&s;ired object, (viz.) The &s;y&s;tem of God's unchanging government, and the glory of his character di&s;played therein, for the good of being. Like the dove of Noah, he here found an ark of re&s;t. Here he had found a &s;y&s;tem that could &s;uffer no change. <HI>I know,</HI> &s;ays he, ver&s;e I4th. <HI>That what&s;oever Gcd doth it &s;hall be forever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doth it that men &s;hould fear before him.</HI></P>
<P>FURTHER to expre&s;s his views, of its un|changing &s;amene&s;s, he makes u&s;e of the words of our text. <HI>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been, and God re|quireth that which is pa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THIS &s;acred pa&s;&s;age, therefore, affords us this &s;oul con&s;olating doctrine; (viz.) that that eter|nal rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s, contained in God's moral government, and the ground of our ac|ceptance with him, is &s;o infinitely perfect, and &s;o well &s;uited to the capacities, and circum&s;tan|ces of his creatures, on every occa&s;ion, that it can admit of no change. But that which hath
<PB N="8" REF="024126_0007_0FC3B5E6E375BA70">
been the rule of our conduct towards God &amp; our fellow men, and that which hath been the ground of our acceptance with God, is now; and that which is to be hath already been. And likewi&s;e that the &s;ame virtuous exerci&s;es, that were re|quired in pa&s;t ages of the world, are required now.</P>
<P>FOR our further improvement of this &s;ubject on the pre&s;ent important occa&s;ion we &s;hall ob|&s;erve,</P>
<P>I. THAT the &s;cheme of divine admini&s;tration, both in its nature and requirements, is &s;o &s;uited to the capacities of men, that it is the indi&s;pen|&s;ible duty, of all ranks of men, without di&s;|tinction, cheerfully to &s;ubmit to, and obey God therein,</P>
<P>II. THAT this obedience only, can afford &s;ub&s;tantial and la&s;ting &s;ati&s;faction to the human heart.</P>
<P>III. THAT this obedience will qualify us to fill our &s;everal &s;tations in life, as well in the civ|il as the eccle&s;ia&s;tical kingdom, to the glory of God and the good of our fellow men.</P>
<P>I. THAT the &s;cheme of divine admini&s;tration, both in its nature and requirements, is &s;o &s;uited to the capacities of men, that it is the indi&s;pen|&s;ible duty, of all ranks of men, without di&s;|tinction, cheerfully to &s;ubmit to and obey God therein.</P>
<P>THE nature of divine government is like its author, infinitely holy, ju&s;t and good. Its holy nature is ea&s;ily &s;een, when we con&s;ider its great
<PB N="9" REF="024126_0008_0FC3B5EE00BE46F0">
end and de&s;ign; which is to a&s;&s;ert the rights of the Godhead, and invariably to vindicate truth and &s;uppre&s;s fal&s;ehood: and that in a manner directly tending to the general good of being.</P>
<P>ONE very con&s;iderable branch of divine ope|ration, is to be &s;een in the creation of the world: in which there are creatures made of different ranks, and their different &s;tations a&s;&s;igned them, exactly according to their various capacities. As we are favored with a rank among the crea|tures of God, what more immediately concerns us to know, is, <HI>our</HI> own &s;tation in the &s;cale of being, and what is the bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;&s;igned us there|in.</P>
<P>THAT we are made rational creatures, capa|ble of contemplating upon and exploring objects pre&s;ented to our view, is a truth, this re&s;pectable audience, will think it needle&s;s to u&s;e arguments to prove.</P>
<P>IF this be granted we are nece&s;&s;itated to be|lieve, that we are capable, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to judge of the quality of tho&s;e objects; and feel our&s;elves con&s;ciou&s;ly concerned, to e&s;timate them according to their real value. The mo&s;t valua|ble objects, therefore, that come within the com|pa&s;s of our &s;peculation, ju&s;tly merit our greate&s;t attention. Nor can this be e&s;teemed a hard&s;hip to a rational mind, if rightly di&s;po&s;ed, Should we not indeed feel our&s;elves greatly injured, if we were prohibited contemplation, on the be&s;t ob|jects pre&s;ented to our view, and were obliged to fill up all our &s;earches and re&s;earches on an infe|rior good.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="024126_0009_0FC3B5EF8FD730E8">ONE part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, therefore a&s;&s;igned us in the &s;y&s;tem, and which appears well adapt|ed to our capacities, is to employ our thoughts in contemplating on, and in forming a right judgment of tho&s;e glorious perfections of the Deity, which are &s;o clearly manife&s;ted in his works.</P>
<P>ANOTHER branch of our work is, always to be employed in loving tho&s;e objects that are made known to us, according to their real worth.
THIS al&s;o is an ea&s;y yoke, well &s;uited to our necks. That we are capable of loving objects of a moral nature, will hardly be denied: for as we cannot be delighted in objects that we can|not love, we either mu&s;t allow that we are inca|pacitated for any higher enjoyments, than tho&s;e which are merely natural, or that we are capa|ble, affectionately to embrace, the important ideas of holine&s;s and virtue. If we admit the former, then we are driven to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of believing, that there are no objects for delight, afforded us in the univer&s;e, but tho&s;e which our context and our own experience proves, to be as un&s;table as water, and intirely in&s;ufficient. If the latter then, we mu&s;t allow, that our &s;upreme affection and delight, ought ever to be placed on that God who is the e&s;&s;ence of all po&s;&s;ible excellence and glory.</P>
<P>THE principles of common ju&s;tice dictate, that every being ought to be loved according to their real worth; as God therefore is the &s;upreme good in the univer&s;e, he ju&s;tly claims our &s;u|preme
<PB N="11" REF="024126_0010_0FC3B5F103D32BF8">
affections. This is &s;o well &s;uited to our capacities, that if we rove in our affections through all the glories of this world, we &s;hall find no re&s;t; nothing permanent, no &s;uitable ob|ject for delight: untiil we &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>Return unto thy re&s;t, O my Soul, for the Lord hath deals bountifully with thee.</HI> P&s;alms, cx, 7. I am not in&s;en&s;ible that the cavils of wicked men are often rai&s;ed again&s;t the degree of this holy exer|ci&s;e which the divine law requires of us. But &s;hall I a&s;k, what is the extent of its requi&s;&s;tions? The Lord Je&s;us defines it thus, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul and with all thy mind, and thy neigh|bour as thy&s;elf.</HI> Matthew, xxii, 37, 39&mdash;On the&s;e two hang all the law and the prophets. This reduced to practice in heart, lip, and life, compri&s;es the whole duty of man.</P>
<P>NOR can this ju&s;tly be thought too &s;evere; for there is nothing more required than all the heart, &s;oul, and mind, that is, all the faculties that are given. And for God to give faculties to us ca|pable of virtuous exerci&s;es, and not require the u&s;e of them would be unju&s;t, and directly mili|tate again&s;t the happine&s;s of his creatures.</P>
<P>As to the love required to our fellow crea|tures, it is to love our neighbour as our&s;elves. This al&s;o is right and fit in the nature of things, for as every creature ought to be loved in pro|portion to its real worth, in the &s;cale of being; and as our fellow men hold the &s;ame rank with us in the &s;y&s;tem, we ought therefore to love them as our&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="024126_0011_0FC3B5F273B54630">ANOTHER idea implied, in this obedience to God, is an unre&s;erved &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his &s;overeign will. This al&s;o is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable: for as with the all-wi&s;e and omni&s;cient Jehovah, there can be no po&s;&s;ible error, either in judgment or de&s;ign, it is infinitely fit that he &s;hould have the &s;overeign di&s;po&s;al of all events.</P>
<P>NOR does this take any privilege from us; &s;eeing we are capacitated to be happy only is a cheerful obedience to him. So long as we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that the judge of all the earth will do right, it can never afford us any unea&s;ine&s;s that he &s;hould govern, unle&s;s we are unwilling that right &s;hould take place.</P>
<P>THIS leads us to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of faith in God, as another branch of our duty to him. By faith I mean, that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the mind, by which we affectionately embrace, and unre&s;ervedly rely, on the truth of God, which he has made manife&s;t concerning his character and will: and tho&s;e things which re&s;pect the relation we &s;tand in to him, and our fellow creatures. No other evi|dence is nece&s;&s;ary for the ground of this faith, than to be a&s;&s;ured, that the doctrine propo&s;ed for our belief comes from God. That we are capable of believing the truth upon this evid|ence, will not be denied; and for finite crea|tures to call in que&s;tion the te&s;timony of the God of truth, is a crime of the fir&s;t magnitude. Hence faith the apo&s;tle, I John v. I0. <HI>He that believeth not God hath made him a liar, becau&s;e he believeth not the record God gave of his &s;on.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="024126_0012_0FC3B5F3F99760B0">FROM the whole it appears that the nature of the divine government, in all its demands upon us, is perfectly &s;uited to our capacities, and ful|ly &s;ecures all our rights to us.</P>
<P>An impartial view of this made our Saviour &s;ay, Matt. xi, 29, 30. <HI>Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for my yoke is ea&s;y and my burden is light.</HI></P>
<P>WE cannot therefore call in que&s;tion the mo&s;t &s;acred obligations that all men are under without di&s;tinction, to obey the&s;e divine precepts: &s;eeing it is a law that nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;ts, in con&s;equence of our relation to God, as his creatures, and not arbitrarily impo&s;ed on us, by him, as a &s;ove|reign.</P>
<P>BY this time, perhaps, &s;ome may think, that the &s;peaker has forgotten the doctrine we &s;o of|ten hear from the pulpit, viz. that mankind are fallen, depraved creatures, wholly dead in tre&s;pa&s;|es and &s;ins. Indeed I have not forgotten &s;o great a truth, which is not only a&s;&s;erted by an a|po&s;tle, Ephe&s;ians ii, I, but is always written in indelible characters before my eyes. But we wi&s;h however to have &s;kill enough to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween the depravity of the human heart, and tho&s;e faculties by which we are capacitated to o|bey God. The apo&s;tle hath well expre&s;&s;ed the i|dea of depravity: <HI>dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins.</HI> This death therefore cannot con&s;i&s;t in reducing our natural faculties to a &s;tate or inactivity: other|wi&s;e we could not be active in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins.
<PB N="14" REF="024126_0013_0FC3B5F5C9BC9D60">Depravity therefore, mu&s;t re&s;pect the di&s;po&s;ition of the heart: and the &s;en&s;e is, that man, by his fall from God, has lo&s;t his original righteou&s;ne&s;s, and is now wholly and voluntarily oppo&s;ed to virtue.</P>
<P>NOR can this ju&s;tly be con&s;idered in the lea&s;t degree to le&s;&s;en our obligations: for it is not the virtue or vice that we po&s;&s;e&s;s, that is the bond of our obligation to God. Should a per&s;on guilty of trea&s;on again&s;t the &s;tate, be brought before this venerable court, and appear wilfully determin|ed to pur&s;ue his villainy, would they judge that the vilene&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould exculpate him from blame? Would they not rather think that &s;uch a judgment would be taking &s;ides with the criminal? Neither can the vilene&s;s of our hearts, be any ju&s;t excu&s;e for our rebellion again&s;t God our rightful &s;overeign.</P>
<P>IT may be &s;aid, if men are thus guilty, how is it God &s;pares the criminal, and continues the world in its pre&s;ent &s;tate? I an&s;wer, only upon the plan of grace which re&s;pects the unworthy. This GRACE however is exerci&s;ed in a way per|fectly con&s;onant with the divine law and gov|ernment.</P>
<P>HERE we &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of a mediator, to make atonement for &s;in. It can be thought but doing ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject, to advert for a few minutes to the character and work of Chri&s;t as mediator.</P>
<P>ST. John in the beginning of his go&s;pel gives in the following important account of the char|acter
<PB N="15" REF="024126_0014_0FC3B5F70F7F4130">of Chri&s;t. <HI>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. All things were made by him, and without him there was not any thing made that was made. And the word was made fle&s;h and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, as the glory of the only be|gotten of the Father full of grace and truth.</HI></P>
<P>FROM hence we learn, that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is very God, that all created things were made by him, that he is of the one undivided of|fence, equal with God, and that he became fle&s;h, or took upon him our nature; &s;o that he is very man as well as God: al&s;o that this God-man is full of grace and truth. Full of the de&s;igns of grace and mercy to a guilty world, and fully de|termined to exhibit that grace in a manner that &s;hould a&s;&s;ert the truth, re&s;pecting the rights of the Godhead, and the honors of divine law and government.</P>
<P>No le&s;s a character than this, is equal to the work of a mediator between offended ju&s;tice, and the offending &s;inner. As &s;in is again&s;t an infinite God, there mu&s;t be an infinite di&s;play made of his di&s;approbation of it: otherwi&s;e hi&s; character and government could not be vindica|ted. The creature being finite, this di&s;play could not be made, in the execution of penalty on the &s;inner, in any other way, than that the &s;entence &s;hould extend to an infinite duration of puni&s;hment. Hence we &s;ee why the &s;acred &s;criptures threaten everla&s;ting puni&s;hment upon the wicked.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="024126_0015_0FC3B5F87054B228">LET us pause a moment! What mean crea|ture, however exalted in the &s;cale of being, that would not blu&s;h to attempt the unequal ta&s;k, of making to atonement an&s;werable to the demands of infinite ju&s;tice? And &s;hould we not all &s;hrink at the thought that divinity &s;hould change, and become a &s;uffering advocate? Here all created intelligences are thrown into a con|&s;ternation! condemnation to the criminal mu&s;t &s;parkle in every eye! Until the complex char|acter of the <HI>God-man</HI> appears: who in his hu|man nature was able by his obedience, perfect|ly to illu&s;trate the glory, and vindicate the honors of the divine precepts: and by his &s;uffering and death, fully to di&s;clo&s;e the divine righteou&s;|ne&s;s in the penal part of the law. Although his &s;ufferings were comparatively &s;hort, yet the infinitive dignity of his per&s;on was &s;uch, that he was able to bear the whole at once. In this o|bedience and &s;uffering of Chri&s;t, we &s;ee a full di&s;play made, of that infinite rule of right con|tained in the divine law, and of God's holy in|dignation again&s;t &s;in.</P>
<P>HERE we &s;ee a way opened for God to exer|ci&s;e grace and mercy, to the &s;inner, con&s;i&s;tent with the rights of ju&s;tice. Through this atone|ment the Holy Gho&s;t is &s;ent down to renew the hearts of man, and bring them to acknowledge the rights of ju&s;tice in repentance for &s;in; and by faith to tru&s;t alone in this complete righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t for ju&s;tification,&mdash;as the ground of our acceptance with God.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="024126_0016_0FC3B5FA0F76D108">THIS will appear the more con&s;i&s;tent, when we con&s;ider that the Lord Je&s;us, not only &s;uffer|ed and died, but that he ro&s;e again from the dead; a&s;cended up on high <HI>who is &s;et on the right hand of the throne of the maje&s;ty in the heavens.</HI> Heb. VIII.I. And that all judgment is com|mitted unto him, and all power both in heaven and earth. This gracious prince therefore, is become the rightful legi&s;lator of the world. Seated on a throne of grace his government to|wards us is a gracious admini&s;tration. Hence it is the world is &s;pared in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, and a &s;pace allowed us for repentance.</P>
<P>BY this, I think we mu&s;t be a&s;&s;ured of our renewed obligations to love, fear and &s;erve God, who has made &s;uch rich di&s;plays of him&s;elf; both as a God of grace and ju&s;tice: and al&s;o, immediately, to repent of our &s;ins, and believe the te&s;timony which God hath given of his &s;on. Otherwi&s;e our crimes will be greatly augmented in his &s;ight. But it is time that I ha&s;tened to &s;hew,</P>

<P>That object in the univer&s;e that is of the mo&s;t real worth, in its own e&s;&s;ential properties; mu&s;t be thought the mo&s;t delightful object for our contemplation: if we are rightly di&s;po&s;ed and can have acce&s;s to the knowledge ot it.</P>
<P>THAT God is this &s;upreme good, and that he has revealed him&s;elf to man as &s;uch, we have al|ready

noticed. And as we cannot be delighted in things that we have no knowledge of, it mu&s;t be e&s;&s;ential to our happine&s;s to employ our thoughts in contemplating on the glories of the divine character. To pa&s;s this unnoticed is al|ways to remain ignorant of, and de&s;titute of de|light in, the greate&s;t good.</P>
<P>AGAIN, however much we may know of the qualities of an object, yet if we do not love it, the more we know of it the more di&s;agreeable feelings we have; love therefore, to tho&s;e excel|lencies of the divine character which he has re|vealed, is e&s;&s;ential to our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS leads us to ob&s;erve, that if we know and love God as he is, infinitely holy, ju&s;t and good; with whom there can be no po&s;&s;ible error, either in judgment or de&s;ign; we cannot be happy un|le&s;s we freely re&s;ign the di&s;po&s;al of all events into his hands. And to be deprived of believing it &s;uch a being, would be to prohibit our confi|dence in the &s;upreme object of our delight.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, he who walks in this obedi|ence, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ly cho&s;es God for his portion, and the chief object of his delight. Here he has <HI>an in|heritance that is incorruptible and that fadeth not away.</HI> In this he is not &s;ubject to di&s;appoint|ments as others are; though he may be di&s;ap|pointed in creature good, yet he can &s;ay with the prophet, Heb. iii, I7, I8. Although the figtree, the vine, the olive, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and the flock &s;hould fail, <HI>yet will I rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="024126_0018_0FC3B5FD12918A40">As the divine law and government contains a perfect rule of right, it can never operate to the di&s;advantage of any one, that is an obedient &s;ub|ject. And as it is below the dignity of a ration|al con&s;cious mind to be happy in oppo&s;ition to right, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that a conformity to the divine law is e&s;&s;ential to our happine&s;s. Indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible for a man to be happy without the temper of mind that the law requires, viz. love or real benevolence; if we have not this we mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of its oppo&s;ite; unle&s;s we ad|mit that we can fall into a &s;tate of entire indiffer|ence, and without any affectionate regard to any being whatever, which would be to fall below the rank of rational creatures.</P>
<P>THE oppo&s;ite to benevolence is to e&s;timate our own happine&s;s, and the gratification of our own de&s;ires, above the honor of God, and the good of being in general. How mi&s;erable &s;uch a per|&s;on mu&s;t be! having &s;et up him&s;elf in oppo&s;i|tion to the divine glory and the general good of being, in the promotion of which all events mu&s;t finally terminate: every event therefore in the univer&s;e mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily operate again&s;t him, and fill the mind with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">u&s;ion and guilt: unle&s;s at times (while in this world) the mind is amu&s;ed, and the con&s;cience lull'd a&s;leep, in the gratification of animal &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>BUT on the contrary, how happy is that &s;oul, which glows with &s;upreme love to God; and with undi&s;&s;embled benevolence to being in gener|al. And while he re&s;ts a&s;&s;ured that the allwi&s;e

legi&s;lator of the world governs in the be&s;t man|ner, he delights him&s;elf in the &s;weet employment of glorifying him, and doing good to his fellow creatures. Thus, while the mind is relea&s;ed from the narrow circle of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, it can rove in the exten&s;ive fields of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and partake of the &s;weet fruits of holine&s;s and vir|tue.</P>
<P>This benevolence to being in general, mu&s;t include our love in particular to tho&s;e of our own &s;pecies, with whom we are more immediately conver&s;ant, and to whom we are more particular|ly called to admini&s;ter good. And who can but &s;ee what a heaven upon earth we &s;hould have, if this di&s;po&s;ition was to govern in families, neigh|bourhoods, towns, and kingdoms.</P>
<P>AGAIN, as without repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Je&s;us Christ, we cannot plea&s;e God, this al&s;o mu&s;t be e&s;&s;ential to our happine&s;s. By repentance we turn from &s;in un|to God, and cheerfully &s;ubmit to his government: By faith we affectionately embrace, and unre&s;erv|edly rely on the characters, offices and work of Chri&s;t as mediator, and receive his righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the alone matter of our ju&s;tification: through which we receive the free pardon of all our &s;ins, peace of con&s;cience, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS righteou&s;ne&s;s is an everla&s;ting righteou&s;|ne&s;s; that which man had in his fir&s;t &s;tate was not &s;o, That righteou&s;ne&s;s he de&s;troyed by di&s;|obedience. if we indeed were to be &s;et back a|gain upon the &s;oul of creature righteou&s;ne&s;s, it

would not be fit that an ab&s;olute promi&s;e of eter|nal life &s;hould be made us upon it: for we might de&s;troy it again by &s;in, and become un|righteous. But this righteou&s;ne&s;s, compleated by a redeemer, will everla&s;tingly &s;ecure the hon|ors of infinite ju&s;tice, while gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e is di&s;played in our redemption and ju&s;tification. We &s;ee there|fore, that here is a permanent foundation for hope and delight.</P>
<P>FURTHER, to illu&s;trate that our happine&s;s is connected with obedience to God, we may ob|&s;erve, that it unites us with, and engages us in, the &s;ame cau&s;e that God him&s;elf, the holy angels, the glorified &s;pirits in heaven, and all the virtu|ous on earth are engaged in. The cau&s;e I mean is that of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. If therefore we are heartily engaged in this cau&s;e, we are in fellow&s;hip and agreement with them. Here we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of the divine approbation and protection. Here we &s;hall &s;hare in the kind of|fices of angels, as mini&s;tering &s;pirits, &s;ent forth to <HI>mini&s;ter for them who &s;hall be heirs of &s;alvation.</HI> In this al&s;o, we &s;hall enjoy the prayers of all the &s;aints upon earth, and the good wi&s;hes of tho&s;e in heaven. We may &s;ay then with the apo&s;tle, Rom. viii, 3I. <HI>If God be for us who can be again&s;t us.</HI></P>
<P>In this righteous cau&s;e we are a&s;&s;ured of vic|tory over all our enemies, and that they mu&s;t fall victims to divine ju&s;tice, in the end, unle&s;s we admit, that God, at la&s;t, will &s;uffer virtue to be|come a prey to vice, and truth to fal&s;hood. We come to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="22" REF="024126_0021_0FC3B60185491E70">III. THAT this obedience will qualify us, to fill our &s;everal &s;tations in life, as well in the civil as the eccle&s;ia&s;tical kingdom, to the glory of God and the good of our fellow men.</P>
<P>RIGHT views of God and his government, gives us right ideas of holine&s;s, truth, righteou&s;|ne&s;s and ju&s;tice, admini&s;tered according to the true principles of benevolence. That the&s;e are the principles on which all governments ought to be admini&s;tered, will not be denied. That a competent degree of knowledge therefore, in this divine &s;y&s;tem, is needful in order to the right ad|mini&s;tration of government, is equally obvious. If then we have &s;o filled up our &s;earches and re|&s;earches, as to have obtained a good degree of ac|quaintance with this infinitely perfect &s;y&s;tem, it will follow what we have acquired one very im|portant qualification, to be u&s;eful either in church or &s;tate.</P>
<P>PUT on the contrary, to remain ignorant of this, is always to remain ignorant of what is right; and con&s;equently not qualified to do right. Such ignorance as this is the cau&s;e why &s;ome men are to anxious to be promoted in places of pub|lic tru&s;t. Puffed up with a &s;en&s;e of their own importance, and &s;timulated from pecuniary mo|tives, they eagerly ru&s;h into important &s;tations in life, ignorant of the great bu&s;ine&s;s they under|take; and without any proper concern, either for the glory of God, or the good of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE parable of Jotham, as in Judges, 9th chapter, gives a ju&s;t portrait of &s;uch characters;
<PB N="23" REF="024126_0022_0FC3B60325B945B8">
for while a becoming diffidence po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the minds of tho&s;e worthy characters, who may fitly be compared to the olive, the figure and the vine; yet the bramble, not only destitute of tho&s;e &s;weet fruits &s;o u&s;eful to mankind, bur are full of pricking thorns, was ready to accept the office of ruler over the trees. Brambles indeed are &s;uch &s;elfi&s;h rulers! and experience often makes good the prophet's words: The be&s;t of them is as a brier, and the mo&s;t upright is &s;harp|er than a thorn hedge.

<P>BUT tho&s;e, who&s;e real merit brings them to po&s;ts of honor, feel fea&s;ible that they have need of wi&s;dom and prudence, need to ponder the paths of their feet, that they might &s;o &s;teer the helm of government, as to run clear of tho&s;e fa|tal bars, that always lie in the narrow gulf of a wicked and &s;elfi&s;h admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>BUT knowledge only will not complete a vir|tuous character; love al&s;o to the truth we know is an e&s;&s;ential qualification: for as we are gener|ally governed by the &s;upreme object of our de|light, we &s;hall never make it our chief concern to fill our &s;everal &s;tations among men, in con|formity to the divine character and will, unle&s;s he has our &s;upreme affections. I do not &s;ay but that an unregenerate man, or one who has not true love to God, may be u&s;eful in civil &s;ociety, and do many noble things, both in the legi&s;la|tive and executive departments, or that he may not do valiantly in the martial line, and in many other re&s;pects.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="024126_0023_0FC3B6048DF0D518">WICKED men are not only often re&s;trained, by the all powerful influence of Jehovah, from tho&s;e vicious acts, which would be hurtful to &s;o|ciety; but are &s;ometimes influenced, contrary to the general bias of their minds, to do things that are for the general good. But this by no means argues, that we &s;hould tempt God, by filling the important places of public tru&s;t with wicked men.

<P><PB N="25" REF="024126_0024_0FC3B605FAB47910">As the character, offices and work of Chri&s;t, gives us the greate&s;t and riche&s;t di&s;play of the divine character and government; we can but think that faith in him, is at lea&s;t a very u&s;e|ful qualification for a civil officer.

qualified to manage the great affairs of gov|ernment, on which the general good &s;o much de|pends.</P>
<P>AGAIN it is ea&s;y for an unprejudiced mind to &s;ee, that the temper and practice inculcated by the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, is e&s;&s;ential to the good of &s;ociety, viz. love to God and man, &s;ubjection to the divine will, faith in the &s;y&s;tem of righteou&s;|ne&s;s and truth: al&s;o meekne&s;s and humility, calmne&s;s and patience, a de&s;ire to forgive injuries, and to do by others as we would that they &s;hould do by us. The&s;e things if reduced to practice, will make the child obedient to his parents, the parent to bring up his children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; and makes the &s;ubjects yield all due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to magi&s;tracy as an ordinance of God: and the magi&s;trate to fill his important &s;tation, as a mini&s;ter of God for good to the people.

<P>IT is objected, that in many in&s;tances, tho&s;e rulers who have made the highe&s;t profe&s;&s;ion of the chri&s;tian religion, have been the mo&s;t tyran|ical and cruel.</P>
<P>THIS I will not undertake to deny, but it is however to be remembered, that a profe&s;&s;ion on|ly of religion, is very different from the real po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in heart and practice.

But making religion a mere engine of &s;tate policy, and &s;etting up its mini&s;ters to be &s;upported by the civil arm; their office &s;oon became a place of worldly honor and profit. This occa&s;ioned per&s;ons of &s;uperior advantages in life, merely from pecuniary views, to invade the &s;acred of|fice. And what was the event but a &s;cene of horrid prie&s;t craft, attended with pernicious con&s;e|quences.

<P>I AM far from wi&s;hing to have America in|volved in the great error of blending the gov|ernment of church and &s;tate together.

<P>THE nature of a republican government, is a|nother argument why virtue &s;hould be con&s;ider|ed as a nece&s;&s;ary qualification for a civil ruler. It is ob&s;erved by an ingenious author, "that in de&s;potic governments, the force of education is to inculcate fear; in monarchal governments, to inculcate honor; &amp; in republican governments to inculcate virtue." This is true, for virtue is the ba&s;is of a free and republican government.</P>
<P>THIS virtue in the people principally con&s;i&s;ts in three things. I&s;t. In forming a con&s;titution that is a proper ba&s;is for a virtuous government. 2d. In choo&s;ing virtuous rulers to admini&s;ter upon it. 3d. In a cheerful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their righte|ous admini&s;tration. But this golden chain is at once broken, unle&s;s we admit that virtue is a ne|ce&s;&s;ary qualification for a civil ruler.</P>
<P>FROM the whole it appears that the more we are conformed to the unchanging, and perfect rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s, the more &s;olid and &s;ub|&s;tantial happine&s;s we have, and the better we are qualified to do good to others.

<P>FOR tho&s;e who are concerned in enacting laws, &s;uitable for the regulation of our conduct in civ|il life, to be guilty of wronging their creditors, by keeping them out of their ju&s;t dues, or by over reaching, cheating and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their neighbours; or in any other way to injure their fellow citizens, in per&s;on, name or e&s;tate; is in fact practically to &s;ay, that the laws they have made are not worthy to be regarded: which can never fail to le&s;&s;en the energy of government.</P>
<P>A WISE magi&s;trate will let a con&s;tant guard over the words of his mouth; that with a becom|ing moderation, he may expre&s;s his re&s;entment of injuries done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; and have all his language &s;uch as &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to prevent others from an un|civil, profane was of treating their fellow citi|zens. A magi&s;trate that is rough and profane in his language, is a mon&s;trous character. He is not civil him&s;elf, and we cannot expect but that the practice, at lea&s;t, will do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the commu|nity. He is not the gentleman, for any per&s;on of &s;en&s;e knows, that a rough profane way of
<PB N="33" REF="024126_0032_0FC3B62ADEE1BB30">
treating mankind, better fits the character of a clown than a gentleman. Can I &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf in danger of giving offence? No, I cannot think that &s;o re&s;pectable a body, as I am now called to addre&s;s, will think me too &s;evere in centuring &s;o great an evil: e&s;pecially &s;eeing it &s;o much prevails in our land at the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>We, your children, &s;hall look up to you as our political fathers, that all tho&s;e officers who come under the direction of your wi&s;dom to ap|point, will be &s;uch characters as &s;hall do honor to their office. Such as are men of integrity and uprightness. Such as &s;hall make con&s;cience of executing the law on offenders, and &s;uch who&s;e examples &s;hall give energy to government.</P>
<P>THE in&s;titution of learning is of great con&s;e|quence to a tree people. Grateful acknowledge|ments are ju&s;tly due to our wise legi&s;lators, who&s;e liberal and friendly exertions, has given &s;o early a birth to an in&s;titution of this kind, in this infant &s;tate.

<P>As religion at all times, is a matter between God and individuals, your honors will never think it within the limits of your legi&s;lation, to dictate the con&s;cience of a &s;ingle individual. The unchangeable law of righteousne&s;s, forbids us to delegate &s;uch a power to any man, or body of

man, either in church or &s;tate. I do not wi&s;h however, to countenance tho&s;e, who through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of religious tyranny de&s;pi&s;e good order in &s;ocie|ty, and reject tho&s;e friendly aids to the cau&s;e of our holy religion, which may ju&s;tly be expected from our political fathers. Neither would I wi&s;h to be found with tho&s;e, who with for religious e&s;|tablishments by law; which never fail of perni|cious con&s;equences both to church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>As a man, it is the duty of a magi&s;trate, to befriend the cau&s;e of religion in the profe&s;&s;ion and practice of it. As the head of a family he &s;hould maintain family wor&s;hip, and bring up his children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nurture and admonition of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></P>
<P>PERMIT me here to introduce the words of an ingenous author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DR. STILLMAN.</NOTE>, who&s;e learning and experi|ence adds weight to his &s;entiments. "As a ma|gi&s;trate he &s;hould be a nur&s;ing father to the church of Chri&s;t, by protecting all the peace|able members of it, from injury on account of re|ligion; and by &s;ecuring to them the uninter|rupted enjoyment of equal religious liberty." And after ob&s;erving the nece&s;&s;ity of union in the &s;tate, he adds, "On the other hand, if the ma|gi&s;trate de&s;troys the equality of the &s;ubjects of the &s;tate on account of religion, he violates a fundamental principle of a free government, e&s;|tablishes a &s;eperate intere&s;t in it, and lays a foun|dation for di&s;affection to rulers, and endle&s;s quar|rels among the people."</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="024126_0034_0FC3B62F5E1D8C88">THIS however, by no means prohibits the civ|il magi&s;trate from enacting tho&s;e laws that &s;hall enforce the ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e precepts in the chri&s;tian religion, the violation of which is a breach of the civil peace ; viz. &s;uch as forbid murder, theft, adultery, fal&s;e witne&s;s, and injur|ing our neighbour, either in per&s;on, name, or e&s;|tate. And among others, that of ob&s;erving the Sabbath, &s;hould be enforced by the civil power. Otherwi&s;e, tho&s;e irreligious per&s;ons who are &s;o lo&s;t to virtue, as neither to regard divine wor|&s;hip, nor the time appointed for it, will not only interrupt us, by coming to our hou&s;es in our ab|&s;ence, and drawing off our children from good order and family government, but will al&s;o, in attending to their worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, di&s;turb us in the hours of our mo&s;t &s;olemn devotions to God. And this is not all, but tyrannical and cruel ma&s;ters will be allowed to &s;ubject their &s;ervants to a con&s;tant &s;eries of labour, without proper time to re&s;t, or attend to the important concerns of a future world. One rea&s;on given by Mo&s;es for keeping the Sabbath, was, that thy man &s;er|vant and thy maid &s;ervant may re&s;t as well as thou.</P>
<P>As to the aid of the civil power to force men to &s;upport go&s;pel mini&s;ters, I humbly conceive that it never can be nece&s;&s;ary. This they will do freely, unle&s;s it is contrary either to their con|&s;ciences, or wills; if contrary to their con&s;ci|ences, to force them is the wor&s;t of tyranny, if
<PB N="36" REF="024126_0035_0FC3B630CA91FE60">
contrary to their wills, like Peter's &s;word it cuts off the ear, and fills the mind with prejudice a|gain&s;t both the doctrine and the preacher, and of cour&s;e does hurt to the cau&s;e of religion. All &s;uch as are friends to religion, are heartily wil|ling to comply with tho&s;e plain injunctions of heaven, that require the honorable &s;upport of go&s;pel mini&s;ters. And if we would make them religious that are not, it is a poor way fir&s;t so be let them by cutting their pur&s;e-&s;trings with the civil &s;word, which lays a fatal bar again&s;t our having acce&s;s to their con&s;ciences afterwards. I appears therefore, that as religion is a benefit to &s;ociety, that forcing men to &s;upport its min|i&s;ters, is a damage both to church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>MAY the great legi&s;lator of the world honor you with his divine pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing, and prefine over you in all your deliberations: that the people may rejoice under your wife and vir|tuous admini&s;tration, and you be &s;o happy at la&s;t as to meet the approbation of him, who is king of kings, and lord of lords.</P>
<P>SHALL I be allowed a few words to this re|&s;pectable audience in general,</P>
<P>FRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENS,</P>
<P>THROUGH the infinite goodne&s;s of God, we as &s;ubjects of America, enjoy the precious jewel of liberty, which is of more worth than mountains of gold. How doth it become us to adore and prai&s;e that God who has exalted us in privileges above any other nation in the world. It we
<PB N="37" REF="024126_0036_0FC3B63238C6E598">
would have the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings perpetuated to us, let us make it our chief concern to walk worthy of them. Let us examine our own hearts, whether we love the perfect &s;y&s;tem of ihe divine govern|ment, and delight in &s;ubjection to it. The more we are &s;ubjected to this perfect rule of righit, the better we &s;hall be qualified to perform the vari|ous duties we owe to God and our fellow man.</P>
<P>BUT if we live and die enemies to God, by wicked works, although we may here enjoy na|tural liberty, yea we mu&s;t go at la&s;t to the dread|ful confines of eternal darkne&s;s and de&s;pair. But if we live the life we now live in the fle&s;h, by the faiht the Son of God, we &s;hall receive that grace, through his worthine&s;s, whereby we may per&s;eve in well doing, unto eternal life and lib|erty above.</P>
<P>LET US then &s;trive to fill up our remaining moments, in love to God and man, and in &s;ubjec|tion to ihe examples and precepts of our divine redeemer. And as virtue is of &s;o great nece&s;&s;ity for civil rulers, let us not &s;acrifice our country and privileges, either by inattention to whom we elect from one time to another, to rule over us, or by knowingly appointing &s;uch as have not a regard to religion and virtue. Let us al&s;o yield due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to magi&s;tracy as an ordinance of God. Rendering honor to whom honor is due&mdash;and fear to whom tear.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="024126_0037_0FC3B633C8384F20">MAY the Lord of heaven ble&s;s rulers and rul|ed, mini&s;ters and people, that we may all lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty.</P>
