I was free from pain that night, and indeed the pain and inflammation both cea&s;ed from that opera|tion, and never returned again.</P>
<P>And I further certify, that my wife at that time was &s;orely afflicted with rheumatic pains in her hip, which had been upon her a number of years, and had affected her to &s;uch a degree as to render that &s;ide &s;horter than the other, and to make her unable at that time to rai&s;e her&s;elf from her chair without the greate&s;t difficulty, or to walk acro&s;s the room without learning on her &s;taff, and with that &s;upport, not without the greate&s;t inconvenience; and Doct. <HI>Perkins</HI> operated upon her a few minutes, when &s;he declared her&s;elf free from pain, and immediately ro&s;e from her chair, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance or apparent difficul|ty, and walked &s;everal times acro&s;s the room without her

<PB N="8" REF="032669_0008_0FF401CBCC2B6AE0">
trouble with a <HI>&s;pecies of epileptic fits.</HI>&mdash;When I fir&s;t &s;aw him, he had experienced in the cour&s;e of the day, about twelve, each of which u&s;ually held him nearly fifteen mi|nutes. At the commencement of one of them, I took from him about fourteen ounces of blood; but di&s;cov|ering no happy effect, I applied Doctor <HI>Perkins'</HI> patent metallic in&s;truments to his right leg, in which he u&s;ually experienced the fir&s;t attack of his fits. The whole leg immediately became limber and free from &s;p&s;ams, and he &s;oon revived without &s;uffering a general convul&s;ion. About twenty minutes after, I being out of his room, was informed that the &s;ymptoms of another fit appear|ed, and before I could operate on him, he was univer&s;ally convul&s;ed with an entire lo&s;s of rea&s;on. I then applied the in&s;trument to his right leg, &s;ix or eight &s;trokes, when the &s;pa&s;ms immediately cea&s;ed, and he recovered his rea|&s;on. In a &s;hort time, he was &s;eized with another, which was removed very much in the manner of the la&s;t, the in|&s;truments not being applied until a general convul&s;ion had taken place. I then &s;eated my&s;elf on his bed, that I might be enabled to apply the means more &s;ea&s;onably. Here I very &s;oon di&s;covered the &s;ymptoms again, but by applying the in&s;truments, the &s;ymptoms immediately di&s;appeared. Several others at intervals, commenced with their u&s;ual &s;ymptoms, by &s;o contracting and cramp|ing the right leg, that the utmo&s;t exertions of two men were &s;carcely able to &s;traighten it, each of which were, in le&s;s then a minute removed by five or &s;ix &s;trokes of the in&s;truments, before they had extended to the other parts of the body, the leg almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly be coming perfectly lax.</P>
<P>By the reque&s;t of a number of gentlemen, who were then pre&s;ent, when the &s;ymptoms of one appeared, I cea&s;ed to operate, that we might determine whether the above operations had prevented the general convul&s;ions, which before the applications of the in&s;truments, had always &s;ucceeded the fir&s;t attack in his leg. Immedi|ately he fell into a severe fit, which appeared in one uni|ver&s;al &s;pa&s;m. In this &s;ituation, I &s;uffered him to conti|nue a few minutes, when by applying the in&s;truments to
<PB N="9" REF="032669_0009_0FF401CEC87A1310">
his leg again, in le&s;s than one minute he was entirely free from any kind of &s;pa&s;m, and imme|diately recovered his rea&s;on. I &s;till continued by his &s;ide, and prevented &s;everal other general attacks by opera|ting with the in&s;truments at the beginning of the &s;ymp|toms. About one hour and a half after the fir&s;t opera|tion, the fits entirely &s;ub&s;ided. He became ea&s;y and ex|perienced none of tho&s;e di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations, which he ever had after former attacks of this kind. He informs that he had u&s;ually been afflicted with the&s;e fits except at a few intervals, about twenty four hours from the time they fir&s;t commenced, and it is pre&s;umed the application of the metallic in&s;truments, not only &s;hortened the fits, but le&s;&s;ened their number, as at this time they continued not more than nine or ten hours from their fir&s;t com|mencement, and about an hour and a half after the fir&s;t application of the in&s;truments. He further ob&s;erves, that he has di&s;covered none of that debility which had univer&s;ally &s;ucceeded his former attacks, and continues to this day enjoying better health than u&s;ual.</P>
