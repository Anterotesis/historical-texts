<HEAD>PROPOSALS CONCERNING <HI>Religious Societies.</HI> Humbly Offered unto GOOD MEN, in the &s;everal Towns of the Country: For the REVIVAL of DYING RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been propo&s;ed, as a Thing that might be attended with many good Con&s;equences, To Animate and Regulate PRIVATE MEET|INGS <HI>of Religious People for the Exerci&s;es of Religion.</HI></P>
<P>A Decay coming upon them, in many Places, it is thought proper to Reprint what was Publi&s;hed in a Treati&s;e of, <HI>E&s;&s;ays to Do Good,</HI> more than Ten Years ago. Which is in &s;uch Terms as the&s;e. &mdash;</P>
<P>&para; IT is very certain, That where &s;uch <HI>Private Meetings</HI> under a good Conduct, have been kept alive, the Chri&s;tians which have compo&s;ed them,
<PB N="2" REF="002558_0003_0FDB6F59CD9631F8">
have like &s;o many <HI>Coals of the Altar</HI> kept one another alive, and kept up a <HI>lively Christianity</HI> in the Neighbourhood. Such <HI>Societies</HI> have been tried, and &s;trong Engines, to uphold the <HI>Power of Godli|ne&s;s.</HI> The throwing up of &s;uch <HI>Societies,</HI> has been accompanied with a Vi&s;ible <HI>Decay of Godline&s;s,</HI> The le&s;s <HI>Love</HI> to them, the le&s;s <HI>U&s;e</HI> of them, there has been in a Place, the le&s;s has <HI>Godline&s;s</HI> flouri&s;hed there; the le&s;s there has been of the <HI>Kingdom of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THE Rules ob&s;erved by &s;ome, ASSOCIATED FAMILIES may be offered on this Occa&s;ion with &s;ome Advantage. They will tell us what Good may be done by &s;uch <HI>Societies</HI> in a Neighbourhood.</P>
<P N="1">I. IT is to be propo&s;ed, that about a <HI>Dozen Fa|milies,</HI> more or le&s;s, of a Vicinity, agree to meet (the Men and their Wives) at each others Hou&s;es, once in a <HI>Fortnight,</HI> or a <HI>Month,</HI> at &s;uch a Time as may be agreed upon, and &s;pend a convenient quantity of Time together, in the <HI>Exerci&s;es of Religion.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. THE <HI>Exerci&s;es of Religion</HI> for a Meeting, are; For the Brethren to Begin and Conclude with PRAYERS in their Turns; for PSALMS to be Sung; and for SERMONS to be Repeated.</P>
<P N="3">III. IT were de&s;ireable, for the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> now and then, to afford their Pre&s;ence at the Meeting, and pray with them, and In&s;truct them, and Exhort them, as they may &s;ee Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE <HI>Candidates of the Mini&s;try</HI> may do well, to perform &s;ome of their <HI>First Services</HI> here; and here &s;hapen and mould them&s;elves for further Services.</P>
<P N="5">V. ONE &s;pecial De&s;ign of the Meeting, &s;hould be, with United <HI>Prayers,</HI> to ask the Ble&s;&s;ings of
<PB N="3" REF="002558_0004_0FDB6F5B4E4B5CE0" MS="y">
Heaven on the <HI>Family,</HI> where they are A&s;&s;emble, as well as on the re&s;t: That with the wondrous Force of <HI>United Prayers, Two or Three may agree on Earth to a&s;k</HI> &s;uch things, as are to be done for the Families, by our <HI>Father which is in the Heavens.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. SUCH a Meeting &s;hould look upon them|&s;elves as bound up in one <HI>Bundle of Love,</HI> and count them&s;elves obliged, in very clo&s;e, and &s;trong <HI>Bonds,</HI> to be &s;erviceable unto one another.</P>
<P>IF any One in the Society &s;hall fall into <HI>Afflic|tion,</HI> all the Re&s;t &s;hould &s;tudy pre&s;ently to Relieve and Support the Afflicted Per&s;on in all the ways imaginable.</P>
<P>IF any &s;hould fall into <HI>Temptation,</HI> the Re&s;t &s;hould watch over him, and with the <HI>Spirit of Meekne&s;s,</HI> with the <HI>Meekne&s;s of Wi&s;dom,</HI> endeavour to recover him.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould be like a <HI>Law</HI> of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI> to the whole Society, that they will upon all Occa&s;ions, lovingly <HI>Give,</HI> and as lovingly <HI>Take</HI> mutual <HI>Admonitions</HI> of any thing that they &s;ee a|mi&s;s in one another.</P>
<P N="7">VII. AND it is not ea&s;y to reckon up the <HI>good Offices,</HI> that &s;uch a <HI>Society</HI> may do to many <HI>others</HI> as well as to the Members whereof it is it&s;elf com|po&s;ed. The <HI>Prayers</HI> of &s;uch well di&s;po&s;ed <HI>Societies</HI> may fetch down marvellous Favours from Heaven on their <HI>Pastors,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Lives</HI> may be prolonged, and <HI>Gifts</HI> augmented, and <HI>Graces</HI> brightned, and <HI>Labours</HI> pro&s;pered, in an&s;wer to the Supplications of &s;uch <HI>A&s;&s;ociated Families</HI>; and the <HI>Intere&s;ts of Religion</HI> may be mightily pre&s;erved and promoted in the whole Flock, by their Fervent Supplications, and the <HI>Spirit of Grace</HI> mightily poured out upon the Ri&s;ing Generation. Yea, <HI>All the Land</HI> may fare the better for them.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="4" REF="002558_0005_0FDB6F5B9DE6F7E0" MS="y">VIII. ESPECIALLY, when a <HI>Society,</HI> &s;hall &s;et apart, <HI>whole Days for Prayer with Fasting</HI> before the Lord, as it may be proper for them to do now and then upon &s;ome Occa&s;ions: The Succe&s;s of &s;uch <HI>Days</HI> has been &s;ometimes very marvellous: And the <HI>Savour</HI> of them left on the Minds of the Saints, who carried them on, has been &s;uch as nota|bly to prepare them, to <HI>&s;how forth the Death of the Lord</HI> at his Table; Yea, to <HI>meet with their own Death</HI>; when GOD plea&s;es to Order it.</P>
<P N="9">IX. IT is very &s;ure, the <HI>Devotions</HI> fir&s;t, and then after them the <HI>Conferences</HI> carried on in &s;uch a <HI>Society,</HI> will not only have a notable Tendency to produce the <HI>Comfort of Love</HI> in the Hearts of Good Men towards one another; But al&s;o their <HI>Abilities</HI> will be thereby &s;harpened and quickened; they will be rendred more <HI>Able,</HI> to &s;erve many valuable Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P N="10">X. UNEXPECTED Opportunities to <HI>Do Good,</HI> will ari&s;e unto &s;uch a <HI>Society:</HI> But e&s;pecially if a Practice of this Importance were once taken up; That the <HI>Men</HI> who compo&s;e the <HI>Society,</HI> would now and then &s;pend half an Hour together by them|&s;elves, in con&s;idering on that Que&s;tion, <HI>What Good is there to be done?</HI></P>
<P>More particularly;</P>
<P><HI>WHO are to be called upon to do their Duty in coming to &s;pecial Ordinances?</HI></P>
<P><HI>WHO is in any &s;pecial Adver&s;ity, and what &s;hall be done to comfort them?</HI></P>
<P><HI>WHAT Contention or Variance may there be among any Neighbours, and what may be done for the healing of it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>WHAT open Mi&s;carriages do any live in; and who &s;hall be de&s;ired to carry faithful Admo|nitions unto them?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002558_0006_0FDB6F5F329130C0" MS="y">Finally; <HI>WHAT is there to be done for the Advantage and Advancement of our Holy Reli|gion?</HI></P>
<P>IN the Primitive Times of Chri&s;tianity, there was much u&s;e made of a &s;aying which they a&s;cribed unto <HI>Matthias</HI> the Apo&s;tle; <GAP DESC="foreign">. If <HI>the Neighbour of an Elect, or Godly Man Sin, the Godly Man has al&s;o Sinned.</HI> The Obligations of <HI>Neighbours</HI> watchfully to <HI>Admoni&s;h one another,</HI> were what that Saying intended. Oh! How much may <HI>Chri&s;|tians A&s;&s;ociated</HI> in Religious Combinations, do by watchful and faithful Admonitions to prevent being <HI>Partakers in other Mens Sins!</HI></P>
<P>THE Man that &s;hall produce, and promote &s;uch <HI>Societies</HI> will do an unknown deal of good in the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>AND &s;o will he, that &s;hall help forward another &s;ort of <HI>Societies</HI>; Namely, tho&s;e of YOUNG MEN ASSOCIATED.</P>
<P>THESE duely managed, have been incomparable <HI>Nur&s;eries</HI> to the Churches, where the faithful Pa&s;tors have countenanced them. <HI>Young Men</HI> are hereby pre&s;erved from very many <HI>Temptations,</HI> re&s;cued from the <HI>Paths of the De&s;troyer,</HI> confirm|ed in the <HI>right Ways of the Lord,</HI> and prepared mightily for &s;uch <HI>Religious Exerci&s;es</HI> as will be expected from them, when they come them&s;elves to be <HI>Hou&s;holders.</HI> I will make a tender of &s;ome ORDERS, which have been ob&s;erved in &s;ome &s;uch <HI>Societies.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. LET there be <HI>two Hours</HI> at a Time &s;et apart; and let there be <HI>two Prayers</HI> made by the Members of the <HI>Society,</HI> in their Turns; between which let a SERMON be repeated; and there &s;hould be the <HI>Singing</HI> of a PSALM annexed.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="002558_0007_0FDB6F608170D1F8">II. LET all the Members of the <HI>Society</HI> Re&s;olve to be <HI>Charitably watchful</HI> over one another: ne|ver to Divulge one anothers <HI>Infirmities</HI>; always to <HI>inform</HI> and <HI>advi&s;e</HI> one another of every thing that may appear to call for an <HI>Admonition,</HI> and to <HI>take it kindly,</HI> when they are Admoni&s;hed.</P>
<P N="3">III. LET all who are to be admitted, as Mem|bers of the <HI>Society,</HI> be accompanied by two or three of the re&s;t, unto the <HI>Minister</HI> of the Place, that they may receive his holy Coun&s;els and Char|ges, and that every thing may be done with his Approbation; and &s;o let their <HI>Names</HI> be added unto the <HI>Roll.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. IF any Per&s;on thus enrolled among them, fall into a <HI>Scandalous Iniquity,</HI> Let the <HI>Rebukes</HI> of the <HI>Society</HI> be di&s;pen&s;ed unto him, and let them forbid him to come any more among them, until he bring &s;uitable Expre&s;&s;ions and Evidences of <HI>Re|pentance</HI> with him.</P>
<P N="5">V. LET the Lift be once a <HI>Quarter</HI> called over; and then, If it be ob&s;erved, that any of the <HI>Society</HI> have much ab&s;ented them&s;elves, Let there be &s;ome &s;ent unto them, to inquire the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of their <HI>Ab&s;ence</HI>; and if no <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> be given, but &s;uch as intimates an <HI>Apo&s;tacy</HI> from good Begin|nings, Let them upon ob&s;tinacy, after loving and faithful Admonitions, be <HI>Obliterated.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. ONCE in three Months, Let there be, if need be, a <HI>Collection,</HI> out of which the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary Charges</HI> of the <HI>Society</HI> &s;hall be defrayed, and the re&s;t be employed upon &s;uch <HI>Pious U&s;es</HI> as may be agreed upon.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="7" REF="002558_0008_0FDB6F621017B488" MS="y">VII. ONCE in <HI>two Months,</HI> Let the <HI>whole Time</HI> of the Meeting be devoted unto Supplications for the Conver&s;ion and Salvation of the <HI>Ri&s;ing Ge|neration</HI> in the Land; Particularly, For the Suc|ce&s;s of the Go&s;pel in that Congregation, whereto the <HI>Society</HI> belong.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. LET the whole <HI>Society,</HI> be exceedingly Careful, that their <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> while they are toge|ther, after the other Services of Religion are over, have nothing in it, that &s;hall have any Taint of <HI>Backbiting</HI> or <HI>Vanity,</HI> or the lea&s;t Relation to the Affairs of the <HI>Government,</HI> or to things which do not Concern them, and do not &s;erve the Intere&s;ts of <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> in their own Conver&s;ation. But let their Di&s;cour&s;e be wholly on <HI>Matters of Religion,</HI> and tho&s;e al&s;o, not the <HI>Di&s;putable</HI> and <HI>Controver|&s;al</HI> Matters, but the Points of <HI>Practical Piety.</HI> They may propo&s;e <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> upon this Intention, and every one in an orderly manner, take his Li|berty to an&s;wer them, or they may go through the <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI> and one at one Time, another at another, heat all the re&s;t Recite the An&s;wers thereof. Or they may be otherwi&s;e directed by their <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> to &s;pend their Time together <HI>Profitably.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. LET every Per&s;on in the <HI>Society,</HI> look upon it, as a <HI>Special Ta&s;k</HI> incumbent on him, to look out for &s;ome <HI>other</HI> hopeful Young Man, and u&s;e all proper Pains to engage him in the <HI>Re&s;olutions of Godline&s;s,</HI> until he al&s;o &s;hall be joined unto the <HI>Society.</HI> And when a <HI>Society</HI> &s;hall be in this Way increa&s;ed unto a fit Number, Let it &s;warm into <HI>more</HI>; who may hold an u&s;eful <HI>Corre&s;pondence</HI> with one another.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002558_0009_0FDB6F6740DD09F0">THE Man, who &s;hall be the In&s;trument of &s;et|ting up &s;uch a <HI>Society</HI> in a Place, cannot compre|hend unto what a long and Rich Train of <HI>Good Con&s;equences,</HI> he is become In&s;trumental.</P>
<P>AND they that &s;hall in &s;uch a <HI>Society</HI> together carry on the Duties of Chri&s;tianity, and the Prai&s;es of a Glorious CHRIST, will have upon them|&s;elves, a Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Symptom</HI> that they &s;hall be <HI>toge|ther A&s;&s;ociated</HI> in the <HI>Heavenly City,</HI> and in the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s that &s;hall never have an End.</P>

<BIBL><HI>LUKE XIX. 42.</HI></BIBL>
<P>If thou had&s;t known, even thou, at lea&s;t in this thy day, the things which be|long unto thy Peace.</P></Q>
<P><HI>WHO</HI> &s;poke the&s;e Words, and of <HI>whom,</HI> and <HI>when,</HI> and <HI>why,</HI> is well known unto us. What I am immediately to endeavour, is to an&s;wer Three QUESTIONS upon them. Fir&s;t, What are the <HI>Things that be|long unto our Peace</HI>? Then, What it is for us to <HI>know the&s;e things?</HI> And la&s;tly, When it may be &s;aid, that <HI>a Day</HI> for that Purpo&s;e is vouch&s;afed unto us?</P>
<P>WE are to Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">I. WHAT are the <HI>Things that belong unto our Peace:</HI></P>
<P>PEACE is a very comprehen&s;ive Word. It may in the <HI>Notation</HI> of it be &s;omewhat <HI>Narrow.</HI> The Engli&s;h Word, <HI>Peace,</HI> as the Latin <HI>Pax,</HI> comes [<HI>a Pactione</HI>] from a Word that &s;ignifies, <HI>Covenant|ing.</HI> The Greek Word, [<GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>a Connectendo,</HI>] &s;trictly taken intimates no more than a <HI>Knitting together.</HI> But in the <HI>Acceptation</HI> of it, it is <HI>exceeding Broad.</HI> It comprehends <HI>all man|ner of Good.</HI> The mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive Salutation the Holy Language can find, is, <HI>Peace be to you.</HI></P>
<P>IN One Word, then, Whatever Tends to pro|mote our Pre&s;ent and Future <HI>Welfare,</HI> is to be rec|koned among <HI>the Things that belong unto our Peace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002558_0012_0FDB6F6A48E15890" MS="y">YOU &s;hall hear what the chief of them are.</P>
<P>THE Fir&s;t is, FAITH. GOD and the <HI>Unbelie|ver,</HI> are in Ill Terms with each other. As the <HI>Carnal Mind is Enmity again&s;t GOD,</HI> &s;o, <HI>GOD is angry with the Wicked every Day.</HI> Yea, &s;uch is His <HI>Anger</HI> as to <HI>Swear in His Wrath against him,</HI> [Heb. III. 18.] if he continue &s;o. The <HI>Un|believer,</HI> if he continue &s;uch, is indeed as &s;ure of <HI>Damnation,</HI> and of a <HI>Wrath unto the Uttermo&s;t,</HI> as if he were already fa&s;t bound in the dark Fetters and impri&s;oned in the <HI>Tophet ordained of old.</HI> When CHRIST is offered, then a <HI>Peace</HI> is offered. The offer of a CHRIST, is an offer of <HI>Peace,</HI> to unbelieving Rebels. When a CHRIST was born, the <HI>Morning-Stars that &s;ung for Joy,</HI> triumphed in the mention of, <HI>Peace on Earth,</HI> upon it. Our JESUS is indeed, I&s;ai. IX. 6. <HI>The Prince of Peace.</HI> And He is called, Eph. II. 14. <HI>Our Peace.</HI> Be|cau&s;e, I will not &s;ay, <HI>When the A&s;&s;yrian comes in|to our Land,</HI> but, when the Almighty comes down in the black Garments of His Vengeance, with the Keen Darts of Ju&s;tice in His Hand, ready to &s;trike and tread us down in the Place of Dragons. <HI>Then! This Man (who is more than a Man) &s;hall be our Peace</HI>! Now by <HI>Faith</HI> it is, that we get an Intere&s;t in a CHRIST, and in the <HI>Peace</HI> which He has wrought; an Intere&s;t in <HI>Peace with GOD</HI>; For, Rom. V. 1. <HI>Being justified by Faith, we have Peace with GOD, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST.</HI> This infers <HI>Peace of Con&s;cience</HI>; For, <HI>Faith</HI> and a <HI>Good Con&s;cience</HI> go hand in hand. Mo&s;t certain it is, the <HI>Aver|&s;ion</HI> of GOD for us, would have been Irrecon|cilable;
<PB N="4" REF="002558_0013_0FDB6F6BC2044FC8">
His Wrath again&s;t us Irremediable and Unappea&s;able; and the <HI>Never-Dying Worm,</HI> would be an <HI>Ever-gnawing</HI> one: But, FAITH, <HI>Faith,</HI> is that which brings all to <HI>Peace</HI>; And it may be &s;aid of the Believer, as it was of <HI>Solomon,</HI> He <HI>has Peace on all &s;ides round about him.</HI> If a Soul become in this way a <HI>Son of Peace,</HI> then <HI>Peace will re&s;t upon it.</HI> But if it be not &s;o, then <HI>&s;hall be heard a Voice of Trembling and Fear, and not of Peace.</HI> I conclude this Article as <HI>Peter</HI> concludes his Epi&s;tle: <HI>Peace be with all them that are in CHRIST JESUS.</HI></P>
<P>THE Second is, REPENTANCE. 'Tis our <HI>League</HI> with Sin, that produces a <HI>War</HI> between GOD and Man. <HI>Your Iniquities have &s;eparated!</HI> Indeed, the Sinner ble&s;&s;es him&s;elf, &s;aying, <HI>I &s;hall have Peace.</HI> But what an Alarum of <HI>War</HI> has GOD &s;ounded again&s;t him? [See Deut. XXIX 19, 20.] Where <HI>Joram</HI> &s;aid unto <HI>Jehu, Is it Peace, Jehu?</HI> He an&s;wered, <HI>What Peace as long as the Whore|doms &amp; the Witchcrafts are &s;o many?</HI> So may it be &s;aid unto the Impenitent Sinner, <HI>What Peace, as long as thy Indulged Impieties are &s;o many?</HI> And that Peal may be rung in his Ears; I&s;ai XLVIII. 22. <HI>There is no Peace, &s;aith my GOD, unto the Wicked.</HI> Indeed, <HI>Let the wicked for&s;ake his way, and the unju&s;t man his thoughts</HI>; and All &s;hall be well. But, <HI>If be turn not,</HI> the Almighty hath <HI>what a Sword, and bent a Bow; and prepared for him the Instruments of Death.</HI> Every Im|penitent Sinner, is a De&s;perado of that Number, [Act. V. 39.] They are <HI>found even to fight again&s;t GOD</HI>; Yea, That <HI>&s;tretch out their hand again&s;t GOD, and strengthen them&s;elves
<PB N="5" REF="002558_0014_0FDB6F6F2B31B958" MS="y">
against the Almighty, and run upon Him, even upon His Neck, upon the thick Bo&s;ses of His Buckler.</HI> Alas, <HI>The way of Peace they have not known.</HI></P>
<P>THE Sinner <HI>Fights</HI> again&s;t Heaven, &s;o long as he <HI>Sins</HI> again&s;t the GOD of Heaven. The <HI>Arms</HI> of his Rebellion are the <HI>Weapons of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Now <HI>Repentance,</HI> this lays down tho&s;e <HI>Arms</HI> of Rebellion; and like the Man in the Go&s;pel, the Sinner &s;eeing that he cannot grapple with the Almighty, and <HI>is not &s;tronger than He,</HI> he humbles him&s;elf, and he <HI>de&s;ires Conditions of Peace.</HI> One <HI>Sin</HI> unrepented of will i&s;&s;ue in the Confu&s;ion of the Soul. <HI>Had Zimri Peace, who &s;lew his Ma&s;ter?</HI> So, Shall that Man have <HI>Peace,</HI> who tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the Law, and who tramples on the Authority of his <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> a <HI>Master</HI> that is his <HI>Maker</HI> too, and his GOD? He alone is at <HI>Peace</HI> with GOD, who is at <HI>War</HI> with <HI>Sin.</HI></P>
<P>THE Third is, HOLINESS. An <HI>Holy Life.</HI> It is &s;aid, Prov. XVI. 7. <HI>When a Mans Ways plea&s;e the Lord, his Enemies &s;hall be at Peace with him.</HI> Yea, Now not only <HI>the Ho&s;ts of the Lord,</HI> but the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> Him&s;elf, will be|come his Friend; and his <HI>Exceeding great Re|ward.</HI> We read, Rom. VIII. 6. <HI>To be &s;piritu|ally-minded is Peace.</HI> Yea, all the ways of <HI>Wi&s;|dom</HI> are <HI>paths of Peace</HI>; And at La&s;t, <HI>Behold the upright man, for the End of that man is peace. Peace,</HI> is a &s;ilken Thread, &s;trung thro' the Actions of an <HI>Holy Life.</HI> Tho' without a Reliance on the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of our SAVIOUR

for our Acceptance with GOD, our mo&s;t <HI>Splen|did Services</HI> will give no other <HI>Peace,</HI> than that which will be <HI>like the Crackling of Thorns under a Pot,</HI> and they who <HI>warm them&s;elves with the &s;parks of their own kindling</HI> mu&s;t <HI>lie down in Sorrow:</HI> Alas, the Ragged and Sordid Garments of our own <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> will never &s;helter our naked Souls from the Storms of Divine Vengeance; Yet I may &s;ay, The <HI>Peace</HI> of a Believer, ari&s;es not only from his <HI>Justification,</HI> but from his <HI>Sanctification</HI> al&s;o. Thus we &s;ee the Lord owning the <HI>Generation of them that &s;eek Him,</HI> with many Soul quieting Di&s;pen&s;ations of His Providence. The <HI>Light of</HI> GOD <HI>&s;hines on the Tabernacle</HI> of the Godly Man.

<P>WHO can expre&s;s the Sweet Quiet of Heart, and ravi&s;hing Comfort of Soul, which a <HI>Life led in all Godline&s;s &amp; Hone&s;ty</HI> is attended withal: There is a <HI>Sweetne&s;s</HI> in the <HI>Work</HI> it &s;elf; &s;uch, that the Servants of CHRIST have thought their very <HI>Work</HI> to be their <HI>Wages,</HI> There&punc; is a Joyful <HI>Serenity of Soul,</HI> that flows in and from a Cour&s;e of Obedience to GOD.

<P>WE are to con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="2">II. WHAT it is for us to <HI>KNOW the Things that belong to our Peace.</HI></P>
<P>Now,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; THE <HI>Nature</HI> of the Things; we mu&s;t have a Right <HI>Knowledge</HI> of <HI>That.</HI> So we read about, <HI>Knowing the Grace of GOD. Ignorance</HI> is indeed the <HI>Mother of De&s;truction.</HI> The <HI>Blind</HI> fall into the <HI>Ditch.</HI> The way to Heaven is a <HI>Narrow way</HI>; And tho' it be &s;aid, <HI>The way|faring men, tho' Fools, &s;hall not err therein</HI>; yet <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> Man, who is <HI>born like the wild A&s;&s;es Colt,</HI> mu&s;t have a CHRIST for his <HI>Prophet,</HI> and
<PB N="8" REF="002558_0017_0FDB6F764F7CD800">
in that way be <HI>made Wi&s;e unto Salvation,</HI> or el&s;e he will <HI>Err,</HI> and be for ever a Stranger to the <HI>way of peace.</HI> O Ignorant Creature, The <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> of thy <HI>Mind,</HI> will bring thee down to the <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Pit. Ignorance,</HI> Ah, Bloody Cur-throat unto Millions of Precious and Immor|tal Souls! How &s;hould People be Saved, with|out <HI>Knowing</HI> the way of Salvation; or, Enjoy <HI>Peace</HI> without <HI>Knowing</HI> the way to the <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem?</HI> The <HI>Go&s;pel of Peace</HI> is therefore &s;uch an ine&s;timable Jewel; Becau&s;e we have the means of <HI>Knowledge</HI> in it.</P>
<P>IT was once pre&s;cribed, <HI>Acquaint thy &s;elf with GOD, and be at peace.</HI> Even &s;o, Let People <HI>Acquaint</HI> them&s;elves with <HI>Faith,</HI> and with <HI>Repentance,</HI> and with <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> if they would <HI>&s;eek peace and pur&s;ue it.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are <HI>Mysteries</HI> in <HI>Faith.</HI> People often delude them&s;elves with an <HI>Historical Faith,</HI> as if it were enough to yield &s;ome Kind of <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> unto the Truth; or with a <HI>pre&s;umptuous Faith,</HI> taking it for granted that their Sins are pardon|ed, whether ever they have with a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul &s;ought for it, or no; or with an <HI>Imper|fect Faith,</HI> receiving a CHRIST in &s;ome of His Offices, but not in all of them. So, for&s;ooth, now they have Commenced <HI>Believers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>REPENTANCE</HI> has <HI>My&s;teries</HI> in it. Hence People fancy, and harbour Conceits, that now and then, a, <HI>Lord, Forgive me</HI>! Or, A few &s;leight <HI>Convictions</HI> of what they have done when they have Sinned; Or the <HI>Reluctancies</HI> of an
<PB N="9" REF="002558_0018_0FDB6F77D89B1280" MS="y">
<HI>Heart &s;miling</HI> of them, and roaring terrible things upon them, and compelling them to fall down on their Knees, and come to &s;ome <HI>Good Re&s;olutions</HI> never to Offend in the like &s;ort again; or &s;ome Terrors of the <HI>Law,</HI> which are like the Fla&s;hes of Hell-fire already &s;ingeing of them; &mdash; are the <HI>Repentance not to be Repented of.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HOLINESS</HI> has <HI>My&s;teries</HI> in it. Hence People take and mi&s;take, a few <HI>Formal Duties,</HI> or &s;uch Things as are the meer <HI>Bark</HI> or <HI>Shell</HI> of Religion; A <HI>Partial Obedience</HI>; or &s;ome notable Works done, but then vainly tru&s;ted in, (and &s;o, but <HI>Splendid Sins</HI> after all!) &mdash;&mdash;To be the <HI>Obedience of Faith,</HI> and the <HI>Godline&s;s which has the Promi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>MANY hear much about <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Re|pentance,</HI> and <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> who never arrive to any other, than a Superficial <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the&s;e Things; They have no real In&s;ight into them. They lie, <HI>Multitudes, multitudes,</HI> in the <HI>Valley</HI> of Perdition; And if the Enquiry be, <HI>Who has done this?</HI> The Reply mu&s;t be that; Ho&s;ea IV. 6. <HI>My People are destroyed for the lack of Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, THE Things are to be <HI>Prized,</HI> Valued, E&s;teemed; There mu&s;t be &s;een an <HI>Excellency</HI> in them. To <HI>Know</HI> is to know the <HI>Worth</HI> of them. <HI>Faith</HI> is to be Prized, as, 2 Pet. I. 1. <HI>Precious Faith. Repentance</HI> is to be Prized, as, 2 Cor. VII. 10. <HI>Not to be Repented of. Holine&s;s</HI> is to be Prized, as, 1 Tim. IV. 8.
<PB N="10" REF="002558_0019_0FDB6F794353DE20">
<HI>Profitable unto all Things.</HI> Indeed, <HI>The Bru|ti&s;h Man knows not, neither does the Fool under|&s;tand this.</HI> The Blind, and Hard, and Sotti&s;h Hearts of Sinful Men, don't Think of the&s;e Things. <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> did not think, that if &s;he <HI>Reverenced the Son of GOD,</HI> and <HI>Repented of the Evil of her Doings,</HI> and <HI>Hearkened unto GOD, and Walked in His Ways,</HI> then her <HI>Peace</HI> would have <HI>been as a River, and her Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s as the Waves of the Sea.</HI> The Anti-type of <HI>David</HI> would have <HI>prayed for the Peace of Jeru&s;alem,</HI> yea, have given <HI>Peace</HI> to it. His GOD and Father, would have &s;aid, <HI>Peace be within thee!</HI> But <HI>not knowing the Things that belonged unto their Peace,</HI> not <HI>Knowing</HI> or Thinking how much they &s;hould find their Ac|count in tho&s;e Things, the Lord of the Vine|yard came, and <HI>destroyed the Wicked Men.</HI></P>
<P>THUS 'tis, with a World of Men and Wo|men in the World. Cumbered with <HI>many Things,</HI> they will not &s;ee, that the coming to a CHRIST is the <HI>One Thing that is needful</HI> for them. A <HI>Laodicea</HI> can do well enough with|out the <HI>Gold,</HI> and <HI>Garment,</HI> and <HI>Eye Salve</HI> of her SAVIOUR. Many &s;ay, <HI>The Stolen Waters are Sweet.</HI> Many &s;ay, <HI>What is the Al|mighty that we &s;hould Serve Him, and what profit &s;hould we have if we pray unto Him?</HI> To have this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> removed, and the Scales drop from our Eyes; and have a New, Clear, Strong, Sight of the E&s;timate which is to be made of the <HI>Things which are not seen,</HI> and which affect our <HI>Eternal</HI> Happine&s;s; This, This is to <HI>Know the Things belonging to our

peace.</HI> They who have &s;tudied the <HI>Style of the Scripture,</HI> tell us, <HI>Words of Knowledge imply Affection.</HI> So when our SAVIOUR &s;ays to &s;ome, <HI>I never knew you,</HI> He means, <HI>I ne|ver liked you.</HI> Which is what He will &s;ay to them, who <HI>know not</HI> what we are now &s;peak|ing of. <HI>Reprobate Silver, the Lord has Re|jected them.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, THE Things are to be <HI>Clo&s;ed</HI> with|al. To <HI>know Sin,</HI> [I&s;aiah LIX. 12.] is, to <HI>be</HI> a Sinner; To <HI>know the only True GOD, and JESUS CHRIST whom He hath &s;ent,</HI> is to <HI>Cleave</HI> unto Him. To <HI>know Faith,</HI> is to <HI>be</HI> a Believer. To <HI>know Repentance,</HI> is to <HI>be</HI> a Penitent. To <HI>know Holine&s;s</HI> is to <HI>be</HI> Obedi|ent, and <HI>Holy in all manner of Conver&s;ation.</HI> 'Tis an <HI>Experimental Knowledge</HI> in the&s;e things, that is the only <HI>profitable Knowledge.</HI> They are like the <HI>New Name</HI> whereof we read, Rev. II. 17. <HI>No man knows it but he that HAS it.</HI> The Chri&s;tian mu&s;t have [an, <HI>Intus Exi&s;tens</HI>] a, <HI>Something within</HI>; Some Divine Sparks of a <HI>Supernatural Knowledge,</HI> that give him other Vi&s;ions of the&s;e Heavenly Things, than what tho&s;e have, who can only talk like <HI>Parrots</HI> of them. <HI>Regeneration</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>known</HI> and <HI>felt</HI> by us, in another manner than by a <HI>Nicodemus, Faith,</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>known</HI> with a &s;en&s;ible <HI>Experi|ence</HI> of tho&s;e things. It mu&s;t be an <HI>Impre&s;&s;ive Knowledge.</HI> There mu&s;t be &s;uch an <HI>Impre&s;&s;ion</HI> of tho&s;e things upon us, as to give us a very <HI>Lively Apprehen&s;ion</HI> of them. To <HI>Know</HI> them, is to <HI>Taste</HI> them; to <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> the&s;e <HI>powers of

the World to come</HI>; To <HI>Live</HI> them, and &s;o have the <HI>Life of GOD</HI> within us.</P>
<P>WE are to Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="3">III. WHEN may it be &s;aid, That we have <HI>OUR DAY Vouch&s;afed us to Know the Things belonging to our Peace.</HI></P>
<P>THE true and proper Limits of our DAY, will be found in the <HI>Motions</HI> of the Holy SPIRIT upon us. But then there are &s;ome Other Things, which &s;o far make <HI>Our Day,</HI> that be|fore <HI>Our Day</HI> is <HI>done,</HI> when they are gone; tho' it may al&s;o be <HI>done</HI> before it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. <HI>DAY</HI> La&s;ts as long as <HI>Life</HI> la&s;ts.</P>
<P>IN this, the Children of GOD have <HI>Their Day.</HI> They are therefore &s;o in&s;tructed; John IX. 4. <HI>I mu&s;t Work while it is Day; the Night comes in which no Man can Work.</HI> Our Time of <HI>Living,</HI> is our Time for <HI>Working.</HI> As the Fourth Commandment has it, <HI>Six Days &s;halt thou Work and Re&s;t the Seventh</HI>: So GOD &s;ends us into the World, and &s;ays, <HI>I have &s;ome Work for thee to do; &s;ome Glory to be brought about by thee in the World; Thou ha&s;t but a little Time to do it in. What thy Hand finds to do, do it with thy might. I have betrusted thee with &s;ome Talents. Im|prove them Faithfully, Prudently, Diligently. And when I &s;end my Me&s;&s;enger DEATH to call thee, thou &s;hall find a Crown re&s;erved for thee.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002558_0022_0FDB6F8079260140" MS="y">YEA, and in this they lie &s;till <HI>Dead in their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins,</HI> have <HI>Their Day</HI> too&punc; GOD is all their Days Calling on them&punc; <HI>Stretching out His Hands unto them all the Day long.</HI> Earne&s;tly Calling, <HI>How long, ye Fools; Will you hate Knowledge?</HI> But when the Term of <HI>Life</HI> is ju&s;t Expiring, and the la&s;t Sand in the Gla&s;s is running, and He has con|tinued inviting them into His Vineyard, until the <HI>Eleventh Hour</HI> be out, and the <HI>La&s;t Hour</HI> be upon them; and their <HI>Destruction comes as a Whirlwind,</HI> GOD then laughs <HI>at their Destruction,</HI> and leaves them in the Dimne&s;s of the Angui&s;h of Death, and the Griping Talons of a dreadful Eternity. <HI>The Living, The Liv|ing,</HI> They may <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> GOD, and get into <HI>Peace</HI> with GOD. <HI>But they that go down into the Pit cannot Hope</HI> for any more. The <HI>Things of our Peace</HI> have taken an Eternal Farewell of them.</P>
<P>Secondly, THE <HI>Means of Grace,</HI> help to make <HI>Our Day</HI> for us. The Old World, who&s;e <HI>Foundation was overflown with a Flood,</HI> enjoyed a <HI>Day,</HI> while they had <HI>Noah,</HI> a <HI>Preach|er of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> among them. This <HI>Preach|ing</HI> was no &s;ooner over, but their <HI>Day</HI> was done. Cries to Heaven for Succour were now to lit|tle Purpo&s;e. The <HI>Ark</HI> being now &s;hut, the Ear of GOD was al&s;o &s;hut upon them. <HI>Sodom</HI> had a Day, whil&s;t <HI>Righteous Lot</HI> was beating his Te&s;timonies there. But when he is gone, their <HI>Day</HI> goes with him. The <HI>Vengeance of Eternal Fire</HI> &s;eizes them. They &s;adly found,
<PB N="14" REF="002558_0023_0FDB6F819B4A8E98">
when the <HI>Mouth</HI> of GOD leaves off <HI>Speaking,</HI> his <HI>Ear</HI> leaves off <HI>Hearing</HI> too. When the <HI>Means of Grace</HI> are gone from a People, <HI>Their Day</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">er with them. It is often &s;o, that upon the Death of an Excellent Mini&s;ter, the People that had his <HI>Light for a Sea&s;on,</HI> but would not be brought home to GOD, have <HI>Their Day</HI> brought unto a Period. GOD leaves them under an Ever|la&s;ting Obduration. He Re&s;olves, <HI>They &s;hall never ta&s;te of my Supper! Never Enter into my Re&s;t!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>OUR Day</HI> is Enlightened, when it is accompanied with many <HI>Opportunities</HI> to make &s;ure of <HI>The Things belonging to our Peace.</HI> A <HI>Peaceable Time</HI> with us, and a Pro&s;perous Con|dition, makes a <HI>Day</HI> to &s;hine upon us. A Day of <HI>Pro&s;perity,</HI> Oh! how much is it to be im|proved with us! We generally allow, that <HI>Ad|ver&s;ity</HI> has a <HI>Voice</HI> in it: GOD <HI>Speaks</HI> to us by our <HI>Afflictions.</HI> But in <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> our <HI>Fat Hearts</HI> are in&s;en&s;ible of any thing <HI>&s;poke</HI> to us: As if <HI>Mercy</HI> were a very <HI>Dumb Thing</HI> indeed! Whereas, Jer. XXII. 21. <HI>I &s;pake to thee in thy Pro&s;perity, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Still Voice</HI> of <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> is not &s;o plainly heard, as the Thun|der and the Tempe&s;t and the Whirlwind of <HI>Calamity:</HI> Yet there is the <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD in it And what is the <HI>Voice</HI> but This; <HI>Oh! That this man would now know the Things of his Peace, at least in this his Day!</HI> What but This; <HI>Oh! That this man were wi&s;e, and would con&s;ider his latter End.</HI> How pittyable the Ca&s;e of <HI>Jeru|&s;alem?</HI> Lam. I. 7. <HI>Jeru&s;alem remembred in the days of her Affliction and of her Mi&s;eries,
<PB N="15" REF="002558_0024_0FDB6F8300325E88" MS="y">
all her plea&s;ant things that &s;he had in the days of old!</HI> So it is; Many a Man lives in the Enjoy|ment of <HI>plea&s;ant things;</HI> If he will <HI>Now</HI> Turn and Live unto GOD, there &s;hall be nothing to di&s;turb him, nothing to divert him. He loiters the Time away; His Lu&s;ts like noi&s;ome In&s;ects, do but multiply by the Sune-&s;hine. At la&s;t, a provoked GOD comes with heavy Blows, with bitter, bla&s;ting, ruining Strokes of His Indignation; Strips him of all his Comfortable Advantages; and now the poor Man cannot Serve GOD as once he could; His Way is every where <HI>hedged up with Thorns</HI>; and he hath nothing left, but a grievous Reflection on his <HI>Expired Opportunities.</HI></P>
<P>A Mans <HI>Pro&s;perous Time</HI> is often his <HI>Proba|tion Time.</HI> If he be not <HI>NOW</HI> brought home to GOD, he &s;hall never be &s;o. <HI>Saul</HI> Exalted and Victorious, falling into a Remarkable Di&s;obedi|ence, never &s;ees a <HI>Good Day</HI> after it.</P>
<P>HENCE 'tis, that <HI>Early Religion</HI> is to be Commended unto us. <HI>Children,</HI> If ever you would Serve GOD with Comfort, <HI>Begin Betimes</HI> to do it; <HI>Betimes,</HI> before the <HI>Evil Days come,</HI> whereof you will &s;ay, <HI>I have no plea&s;ure in them.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. THE Holy SPIRIT of GOD at work upon the Soul; This con&s;titutes <HI>Our Day</HI> in the faire&s;t and brighte&s;t Appearance of it. The other Circum&s;tances give <HI>Time</HI> to us; <HI>This</HI> does inve&s;t us with <HI>Opportunity.</HI> The <HI>Opportunity</HI> to approach and addre&s;s the <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e</HI> mu&s;t be before, Luk. 13.25. <HI>He hath

ri&s;en up, and &s;hut to the Door.</HI> Men may &s;it under the Go&s;pel all their Days; But they will not come into the <HI>Peace of GOD,</HI> except <HI>they &s;eek Him while He may be found,</HI> and <HI>call upon Him while He is near.</HI> There is a Time when our SAVIOUR &s;ays. Rev. III. 20. <HI>Behold, I &s;tand at the Door and knock.</HI> The Soul which <HI>Then</HI> does <HI>Open</HI> to Him, is an Happy Soul. But, thy Delays, O Dilatory Soul, may render thee like <HI>E&s;au,</HI> who <HI>Afterwards,</HI> when he came, and would have <HI>Inherited the Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> mi&s;s'd of it, tho' he <HI>Sought it carefully with Tears.</HI> We &s;hould, as we &s;ay, <HI>Strike while the Iron is hot.</HI> The Godly them&s;elves may pay dear for their Neglect of doing &s;o. <HI>My Beloved has withdrawn Him&s;elf and is gone!</HI> &mdash; may be the Con&s;e|quence. But this is that which above all i&s;&s;ues in the <HI>Perdition of Ungodly Men.</HI> The SPIRIT of GOD vi&s;its them with His <HI>Motions.</HI> He does it in <HI>Sermons</HI>; He does it in <HI>Troubles</HI>; He does it in various <HI>Methods.</HI> He &s;tirs up <HI>Affections</HI> in them, for the Things that are <HI>Holy and Ju&s;t and Good.</HI> They have &s;uch an <HI>Opportunity</HI> to enter the <HI>Strait Gate,</HI> as the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> had for an Entrance into the <HI>Land of Promi&s;e.</HI> They neglect it; And now, when they come <HI>too Late,</HI> and <HI>Weep</HI> unto the LORD, the LORD will not hearken to them. The <HI>Door</HI> is now &s;hut, and if they come with the <HI>Fooli&s;h Virgins,</HI> and cry, <HI>Lord, Lord, Open to me!</HI> the cry avails nothing; He an&s;wers, <HI>I know you not.</HI></P>
<P>FOR this Cau&s;e it is, that the Bible does in&s;i&s;t &s;o much upon <HI>pre&s;ent Obedience.</HI> Thus, Eccle&s;. XII. 1. <HI>Remember NOW thy Creator.</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="002558_0026_0FDB6F892AB4E068" MS="y">
Thus, Jer. XXV. 5. <HI>Turn ye NOW every One from his Evil Way.</HI> Thus, 2 Cor. VI. 2. <HI>Behold, NOW is the Acceptable Time, NOW is the Day of Salvation.</HI> q. d. This is all the <HI>Day</HI> you are &s;ure of; Lo&s;e this NOW, and you &s;hall never have another.

To Day!</HI> As if the taking of, <HI>To Day,</HI> were that which <HI>Eternity</HI> depended on.</P>
<P>AND now, My Brethren; Will you <HI>Know the Things of your Peace?</HI> O <HI>Unregenerates,</HI> Defer not a Moment the <HI>Things that Accom|pany Salvation.</HI> Yea, Let none remain at all Unacquainted with the Things which mu&s;t be done by all that would be <HI>Saved.</HI> If you do <HI>Know</HI> &s;omething of them, Take that Advice, Ho&s;ea VI. 3. <HI>Follow on to Know.</HI> Perhaps, My Friend, Thy <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> may be yet but at the be&s;t, as a <HI>Grain of Mu&s;tard Seed.</HI> Yea, The be&s;t of us all have need of <HI>more Grace</HI> than we have. You are not yet come to <HI>Perfection.</HI> Certain|ly, You need more Weanedne&s;s from the World, more Heavenly-Mindedne&s;s, more <HI>Fervency of Spirit</HI> in <HI>Serving</HI> the Lord; a more <HI>United Heart</HI> in <HI>Fearing</HI> of His Name; a more Self-Aba&s;ing, and CHRIST-Exalting Di&s;po&s;ition. May not the be&s;t of us Complain, <HI>My Lean|ne&s;s! My Leanne&s;s</HI>! Yea, May they not come into the Herd with <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Lean Kine; which though they had <HI>Eaten much,</HI> it could

not be known, that they had <HI>Eaten at all</HI>! Truly, When our GOD comes to look upon us, He may &s;ay, <HI>Be a&s;toni&s;hed, O ye Heavens! Is this the people whom I fed &s;o daintily? Fed with my Word and Sacraments; yea, Fed with my Son! Are the&s;e the Per&s;ons, whom I made to &s;it down at my Table, &s;it down at a Feast of Fat things full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees well-refined. O</HI> Ephraim. <HI>What &s;hall I do unto thee?</HI> O Judah, <HI>What &s;hall I do unto thee?</HI> Oh! That the <HI>Things of our Peace</HI> were better <HI>Known</HI> among us! But then, The <HI>Day of our Peace</HI> mu&s;t be &s;o too. In the <HI>Day</HI> for that Purpo&s;e be&s;towed upon us, Let us Pre&s;s after the fulle&s;t <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Ne|ce&s;&s;ary Things.</HI> The Time we now &s;pend in the Exerci&s;es of <HI>Religion,</HI> be a&s;&s;ured, O Travel|ler towards another World, It will be <HI>no grief of Mind unto thee another day. Religion,</HI> 'Tis thy Bu&s;ine&s;s, Make it &s;o; and Mind not thy <HI>Inn</HI> more than thy <HI>Home.</HI> Soul Bound for Heaven, In thy <HI>Opportunities</HI> to <HI>Know the Things of thy Peace,</HI> and make &s;ure of Ever|la&s;ting <HI>Peace,</HI> What a <HI>Price</HI> is there put <HI>into thy Hand?</HI> Oh! Let it not be in the <HI>Hand of a Fool.</HI> My Friends, Our Formation this Day into a RELIGIOUS SOCIETY brings the <HI>Things of our Peace</HI> near unto us&punc; and gives us a <HI>Day</HI> to <HI>know</HI> tho&s;e Things; and furni&s;hes us with Uncommon <HI>Advantages</HI> for the <HI>getting</HI> and the <HI>doing</HI> of <HI>Good.</HI> As <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> of old wi&s;h|ed. <HI>Oh! that they were Wi&s;e</HI>: Give my Strammer|ing Tongue leave to &s;ay; Oh! That we <HI>knew the Day of our Vi&s;itation</HI>; and &s;o <HI>Numbred our Days as to apply our Hearts unto Wi&s;dom</HI>! Oh!
<PB N="19" REF="002558_0028_0FDB6F8E6DFFC990">
That the <HI>Day of our Peace</HI> were duly perceived and ob&s;erved with us, and highly accounted of, and &s;o husbanded, that we may give a good Ac|count of it! Oh! That we may to Improve our Ine&s;timable <HI>Opportunities,</HI> to Conver&s;e with our SAVIOUR, and become <HI>Full of Goodne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>build up</HI> our &s;elves and one another in the <HI>mo&s;t holy Faith,</HI> as that when we are to be taken from the&s;e <HI>Opportunities,</HI> we may be found <HI>&s;o doing,</HI> and hear it &s;aid, <HI>Well-done, Good and Faithful Servant, Enter into the Joy of thy LORD.</HI></P>
