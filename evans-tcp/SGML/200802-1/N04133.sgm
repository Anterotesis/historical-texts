<P>WHoever is but a little acquaint|ed with the Nature of Man in general, and the Impurity of his own Heart in particu|lar, I am per&s;waded he mu&s;t acknowledge that Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s is the la&s;t Thing that is taken out of the Heart. We are all <HI>Arminians,</HI> we are all <HI>Legali&s;ts</HI>; nay I may venture to affirm we are all <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> by Na|ture. It is true indeed, we pretend to di&s;|claim the Doctrine of Merit; we will not pretend to affirm in &s;o many Words that we de&s;erve any Thing for our Works: But then I believe if we examine our Hearts to the Bottom, we &s;hall find that the mo&s;t of Peo|ple make Je&s;us Chri&s;t only an imperfect Sa|viour; and tho' they do it not in &s;o many Words, yet as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>We go about to e&s;tabli&s;h a</HI> particular <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of our own.</HI> For indeed it mu&s;t needs be &s;o

according to the Nature of Things: being born under a Covenant of Works, it is natural for us to fly to a Covenant of Works again for Salvation, and the Language of every one of our Hearts by Nature is, <HI>What &s;hall I do to inherit eternal Life?</HI> Tho' when we come to be put to the Trial we can do nothing at all. I am verily per&s;waded, they that have been wro't upon by God, they that have been un|hinged of Self, and been enabled to lay hold on a naked Chri&s;t, have found in their own Hearts what I have &s;aid to be true. It is there|fore the De&s;ign of the Chri&s;tian Revelation to point out to us a better Righteou&s;ne&s;s than our own; it &s;hows that we mu&s;t be accepted <HI>not by Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done,</HI> but by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of another being imputed to us: Which was intimated to our fir&s;t Parents immediately after the Fall, for we are told that God made <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> Coats of Skins&punc; Now if Fle&s;h was not allowed to be eaten at that Time, we may in all Probability, nay with a great deal of Confidence affirm, that Sacrifices were made, and that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were cloathed with the Skins of the Bea&s;ts that were &s;lain, in Commemoration of the great Sacrifice of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who there|after was to die an accur&s;ed Death upon the Cro&s;s; and that as the Skins were put

upon the naked Bodies of our fir&s;t Parents, &s;o the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was hereafter to be put on &amp; applied to their poor naked Souls&punc; The Go&s;pel here then was preached to our fir&s;t Parents; and all the Pro|phets that &s;poke from that Time to the coming of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the Fle&s;h, &s;poke of this Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, of an imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s; but none more clearly and in expre&s;s Terms than the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> and in no Place does he &s;peak more explicitly than this we have cho&s;en for the Subject of our pre&s;ent Medi|tation; where he affirms that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is to be <HI>the Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore from the&s;e Words, as God &s;hall be plea&s;ed to give me Freedom &amp; A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, fir&s;t, endeavour to explain who you are to under&s;tand by the Per&s;on here, <HI>The Lord.</HI> 2<HI>dly.</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how you how the Lord is to be <HI>our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> 3<HI>dly.</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to an&s;wer &s;ome of the mo&s;t plau&s;ible <HI>Objections</HI> that are generally bro't again&s;t this Doctrine of the <HI>Lord's</HI> being our Rigteou&s;ne&s;s. 4<HI>ly</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how the <HI>Ab&s;urdities</HI> that will follow from <HI>denying</HI> this Doctrine. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Conclude with an Exhortation to all poor Sinners to come, ju&s;t as they are, in all their Blood, in all their Filth, to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to lay hold on him by

Faith, that by an Application of his Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s to their Hearts, they may be made to cry out, <HI>The Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, I am to &s;how you who you are to under&s;tand by the Per&s;on here termed <HI>The Lord. And this is his Name wherewith he &s;hall be called, The Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Here then, if Curio&s;ity hath brought any <HI>Arminians</HI> or <HI>Socinians</HI> this Morning to hear this Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Preaching, read the Words of the Text, and be a&s;hamed of your dete&s;ta|ble Principles, for the Per&s;on here called, <HI>The Lord,</HI> is the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Lord</HI> that made us, &amp; by who&s;e Power all Things do now con&s;i&s;t. That it is &s;poken of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is plain from the Context, it is plain from the very Words going before the Text; &s;ays the Prophet in the 5th Ver&s;e, <HI>Behold,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the Days &s;hall come that the Lord will rai&s;e unto</HI> David <HI>a righteous Branch, and a King &s;hall reign and pro&s;per, and &s;hall execute Judgment and Ju&s;tice in the Earth; in his Day</HI> Judah <HI>&s;hall be &s;aved, and</HI> I&s;rael <HI>&s;hall dwell &s;afely. And this is his Name wherewith he &s;hall be called, The Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Now all mu&s;t certainly agree, and do agree, that the <HI>righteous Branch</HI> here &s;ignifies the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and he that is called the <HI>righteous Branch</HI> in the 5th Ver&s;e, is called the <HI>Lord</HI> in the 6th Ver&s;e. The Word <HI>Lord</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="005090_0006_1016A362F78D40A0">
in the Original is <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the incommuni|cable Name of the eternal God him&s;elf; and if Je&s;us be Lord, this &s;ays that Je&s;us Chri&s;t mu&s;t be really, truly and properly God. The Per&s;on here then &s;poken of is Chri&s;t, and he is repre&s;ented as very God, as co-e&s;&s;ential, co-equal, and co-eternal with the Father. For indeed if Je&s;us Chri&s;t be not God, my dear Friends, I am &s;ure I &s;hould never preach the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t again. For, what Comfort can a poor convinced Sinner have, what Hope can he have, when he &s;ees the infinite De&s;ert of Sin, unle&s;s he &s;ees his Help laid upon one that is Mighty and Almighty? I can never think that an <HI>Arian</HI> and <HI>Socinian</HI> can con|tinue &s;uch, that have felt the Power of Chri&s;t's Blood upon their Soul. They that have felt this Power, I am per&s;uaded, will not &s;peak &s;o light of this dear Redeemer. And I am amazed that <HI>Arians</HI> &s;hould pre|tend to be Men of Sen&s;e, and yet broach &s;uch an ab&s;urd Opinion, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is a created God. Was there ever &s;uch a Contradiction in Terms; a God, and yet created, a God, and yet limited. <HI>Arians</HI> generally cry out again&s;t <HI>Popery,</HI> but<HI>Arian|i&s;m</HI> is <HI>Popery</HI>; it is Idolatry to wor&s;hip the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t if he be a Creature, tho' a Creature of the highe&s;t Order; it is as
<PB N="8" REF="005090_0007_1016A365E0B45468">
much Guilt to wor&s;hip him, as for Papi&s;ts to wor&s;hip the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>&punc; What renders their Wor&s;hip Idolatry is, becau&s;e the Vir|gin <HI>Mary</HI> is a Creature; and if Je&s;us Chri&s;t be a Creature, tho' of the highe&s;t Order, it's Idolatry to put up our Prayers to him. As for the <HI>Socinians,</HI> their Principle, if the Word of God be true, it mu&s;t condemn them, mu&s;t damn them for ever; for the <HI>Socinians</HI> &s;ay, that Je&s;us was only a good Man, and that he died for Sinners to be an Example of &s;uffering patiently. The <HI>Socinians</HI> do not refu&s;e to call Je&s;us Chri&s;t their Saviour, and yet they make him only a Man; where their own Principles condemn them, for what &s;ays the Scripture, <HI>Cur&s;ed is the Man that tru&s;ts in an Arm of Fle&s;h</HI> Now if we believe Chri&s;t to be only a meer Man, and yet put our Tru&s;t in him for eternal Salvation, if the Scripture be true, that Per&s;on is an Ido|later. But I would &s;ain hope there are few or none &s;uch among you, that deny the Di|vinity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Take away this, and you &s;ap the Foundation; take away the Divinity or Chri&s;t, and the Go&s;pel is &s;unk, nothing remains but Morality; <HI>Plato</HI> and other Philo&s;ophers will make as good Savi|ours as Je&s;us Chri&s;t, if Je&s;us Chri&s;t be not really, truly and properly God. This then is the Foundation of our Religion, the Di|vinity
<PB N="9" REF="005090_0008_1016A36772C1BA88">
of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He is &s;po|ken of under this Character in the Text, and this is a Character that he will maintain to the End of the World; and whoever may di&s;pute his Divinity now, they will both &s;ee and feel it to their eternal Sorrow when the Lord Je&s;us comes to Judgment. But I hope I need not &s;pend Time among you to prove the Divinity of the Son of God. It may ra|ther be more &s;uitable to go on to,</P>
<P>The Second Thing, to &s;how you how this <HI>Lord,</HI> even the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> is to be the <HI>Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And that is in one Word, by <HI>Imputation</HI>; it is to be accounted of and made over to us as ours, the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is to be imputed to us. And when I &s;peak of the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, I do not confine my Idea of it to his Death, as mo&s;t People do; they talk of the Merits of Chri&s;t, but then they generally think of the Death of Chri&s;t, but we mu&s;t remember that the Obedience of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is to be imputed likewi&s;e, for Je&s;us Chri&s;t not only died, but Je&s;us Chri&s;t lived for us, lived in our &s;tead, fulfilled the Covenant of Works which we had broken, in our &s;tead, and by his Death he made an Attonement for the Guilt we had contracted by breaking God's Law. God made Man upright, in the Image of God made he Man.
<PB N="10" REF="005090_0009_1016A36947D2DE60">
Now when Man was in this State, tho' God might have in&s;i&s;ted upon his Obedience for ever, without promi&s;ing any Reward; yet God was plea&s;ed to conde&s;cend, (O wonder|ful Conde&s;cen&s;ion it was!) to enter into a Covenant or Agreement with his Creature, promi&s;ing him eternal Life if he continued in his Obedience, (and he had Power given him to do that,) but threatned him with eternal Damnation if he brake his Law. Now <HI>Adam</HI> was our Repre&s;entative and the Head of all Mankind; and had we then been alive, and God had put it to our Choice, then Terms were &s;o rea&s;onable, we &s;hould all with one Con&s;ent have agreed that <HI>Adam</HI> &s;hould have acted in our &s;tead, it could never have enter'd into our Heart to think that that Man could fall from his Obedience; therefore it is the greate&s;t Folly to charge God with In|ju&s;tice for imputing his Sin to us. Here then, God made a Covenant with Man, but the Devil envying Man's Happine&s;s, tempted him, Man was &s;educed by him to eat the forbidden Fruit, whereby he immediately died, became liable to eternal Death; We died in him, and became the Objects of God's eternal Wrath. And God might ju&s;tly have left the whole Race of Mankind, as he did the fallen Angels, whom he hath re&s;erved in Chains of Darkne&s;s to the Judgment of the
<PB N="11" REF="005090_0010_1016A36EAFE26858">
great Day. But rejoice, O Heavens, and be glad, O Earth, Tho' the fallen Angels are left to peri&s;h, behold, fallen Man is taken into Mercy. Ju&s;tice demanded Satisfaction, yet Mercy interpo&s;ed. After we had bro|ken the Law, we were obliged to obey the Law as much as ever, but as &s;oon as we did eat the forbidden Fruit, we lo&s;t our Power. Be&s;ides, Satisfaction mu&s;t be made to Ju&s;tice. <HI>The Soul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall die.</HI> Now if God be ju&s;t, we mu&s;t be puni&s;hed; and if Man mu&s;t be puni&s;hed, he mu&s;t always be &s;atisfying, and never &s;atisfy infinite Ju&s;tice. Now then, God did that for us which we could not do for our &s;elves. Behold, God the Father, unknown to us, entered into an eternal Contract with his Son, and made him the Repre&s;entative and Head of the Elect, of an immen&s;e Multitude which the Father gave into his Hand. Je&s;us Chri&s;t then un|dertook to bring in an everla&s;ting Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s for them; and that all God's Attri|butes might now triumph, behold, he un|dertakes to take to him&s;elf our humane Na|ture, to fulfil the Moral Law that we had broken; and rather than we &s;hould be damned, Je&s;us Chri&s;t de&s;ired his Father to &s;heath the Sword of his Ju&s;tice in his Brea&s;t. And therefore, O wonderful Love! that our dear Redeemer, tho' he was in the Form of
<PB N="12" REF="005090_0011_1016A3730D8545F0">
God, tho' he thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, yet took upon him the Form of a Servant, in that Form lived a painful Life, fulfilled all Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and at la&s;t died an accur&s;ed ignominious Death upon the Cro&s;s; whereby he &s;atisfied the Ju&s;tice of God, procured an Union betwixt God and our Souls; and by his Obedience wrought out a compleat all &s;ufficient Righteou&s;ne&s;s, for all tho&s;e who &s;hould hereafter be enabled to lay hold on his Righteou&s;ne&s;s. This then is what I under&s;tand by the Word <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI> And I am &s;ure it is glad Tydings of great Joy to all that feel their Mi&s;ery, and that are hungering and thir&s;ting after <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> I know it is &s;weet Soul reviving Doctrine to all that are &s;ick of Sin. But precious as it is to convinced Sinners, yet it grates the na|tural Man's Heart. For we have contracted &s;uch a Pride by our Fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> that if we cannot be &s;aved by our own Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, we will venture to be damned. This is the Temper of all by Nature.&mdash; And therefore tho' this be Soul-ravi&s;hing Doc|trine to all that know them&s;elves aright, yet perhaps there is not a Doctrine that has met with more Oppo&s;ition in the World. Thou|&s;ands of <HI>Objections,</HI> no doubt have been &s;tar|ted again&s;t it. It would be endle&s;s for me to an&s;wer every thing. But however I &s;hall
<PB N="13" REF="005090_0012_1016A3749FFDBA50">
now <HI>Thirdly</HI> undertake by the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;|tance to an&s;wer &s;ome of the mo&s;t plau&s;ible <HI>Objections</HI> generally urged again&s;t this Doc|trine.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, It is ob&s;ervable, that tho&s;e who object again&s;t an imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s would fain be great Advocates for <HI>Morality,</HI> yet I generally find they are a Company of the mo&s;t immoral People them&s;elves; they cry out for Morality, yet I do not find that they have &s;o much Morality them&s;elves; true Morality is above their Power; They may &s;ee what they ought to do, but they want Power, becau&s;e they do not believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t&punc; However, they bring Scripture for their Purpo&s;e, and it is no Wonder when the Devil brought Scripture. They tell us that Je&s;us Chri&s;t preached Mo|rality in his <HI>Sermon on the Mount</HI>; you will find there Chri&s;t preaching Morality, and you are always preaching Faith. But I would de&s;ire to know with what Eyes they have read our Saviour's Sermon on the Mount. It's true, Je&s;us Chri&s;t does recom|mend Morality, and every Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ter does preach Morality, but he will preach Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t as the Foundation of Morality. There can be no true Morality which is not bottomed upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t. That they can get no Argument from <HI>Chri&s;t's
<PB N="14" REF="005090_0013_1016A378F07E3710">
Sermon on the Mount,</HI> is evident from this, that before Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;peaks of good Works, he pronounces them ble&s;&s;ed that are <HI>poor in Spirit,</HI> that are <HI>pure in Heart,</HI> that are holy <HI>Mourners,</HI> that <HI>hunger and thir&s;t after Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; and then &s;ays he, <HI>Let your Light &s;o &s;hine before Men,</HI> that is, Evidence this divine Life in your Heart by good Works, <HI>that Men may &s;ee your good Works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</HI> Here Je&s;us Chri&s;t lays down <HI>hungering and thir&s;ting after Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> (no doubt, his imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s,) as the Foundation of Morality. Bring People to Chri&s;t fir&s;t, and then they will live well; but to bid them live well fir&s;t, is to bid them build with|out a Foundation.</P>
<P>But then &s;ay they, This is the Way to open a Door to <HI>Licenciou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> This is an old trite Argument, and I am much amazed that Men of Sen&s;e &s;hould take an Argu|ment out of an Infidel and Unbeliever's Mouth; for Saint <HI>Paul</HI> introduces an Infidel making this Objection, and an&s;wers it by &s;aying, <HI>Shall we continue in Sin, that Grace may abound?</HI> We do not preach down good Works, but only thus far, that they cannot <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> us in the Sight of God. We are ju&s;ti|fied without any Regard to our Works pa&s;t, pre&s;ent or to come. Our Works have no|thing
<PB N="15" REF="005090_0014_1016A37A77BEC080">
to do as to our Ju&s;tification in the Sight of God. They are no Induce|ment to God to have Pity upon us. We are <HI>ju&s;tified freely by Grace</HI> without Re|gard to any Fore&s;ight of our Works: But then, my dear Friends, Do we preach down Works, when we &s;ay &s;o? No, we preach up Works, we exhort to Morality. Let Peo|ple lay hold on Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, a di|vine Fire will immediately fill their Souls, the Love of God will be &s;hed abroad in their Heart, and out of Love to God for what he has done for their Soul, it will be the Language of their Heart, <HI>Lord Je&s;us, what &s;hall I do</HI>? not to recommend me to God, but only to give thee &s;ome Token of my Love for what thou ha&s;t done for my Soul. This is the genuine Fruit of the Doctrine of Ju&s;tification by Faith. <HI>The Doctrine of im|puted Righteou&s;ne&s;s is the Article by which the Church &s;tands or falls,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Luther.</HI> By this Doctrine, the Reformation was brought a|bout. If we de&s;ire to have true Religion and Piety to abound among us, we mu&s;t preach more and more of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Therefore, notwith&s;tan|ding this Objection, we may affirm that <HI>the Lord is our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But yet they will bring Scripture again, another plau&s;ible Objection they have is from
<PB N="16" REF="005090_0015_1016A37D66F40FA8">
the <HI>Young Man</HI> in the Go&s;pel; they &s;ay, he was to be ju&s;tified by Works, therefore the Doctrine of the imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t mu&s;t fall. Well then, let us examine the Hi&s;torian. There was a young Gentle|man came to Chri&s;t and I wi&s;h there were more young Gentlemen doing &s;o,) he &s;ays, <HI>Good Ma&s;ter, what &s;hall I do to inherit eternal Life</HI>? A proper Que&s;tion for all. Well, &s;ays Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Thou knowe&s;t the Command|ments, Thou &s;halt not &s;teal, thou &s;halt not kill, thou &s;halt not commit Adultery, defraud not</HI>; Now &s;ay they, Becau&s;e Chri&s;t refers this Man to his Commands, therefore he refers him to be ju&s;tified by his Works. But my dear Friends, this was of purpo&s;e to con|vince him that he was to be &s;aved by a bet|ter Righteou&s;ne&s;s than his own. What was the End of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in referring him to his Commands, but that the young Man comparing his Life with the&s;e Commands, might find that he had broken all the&s;e Commands, and therefore that <HI>the Law</HI> might be <HI>a Schoolma&s;ter</HI> to lead him to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that he might be convinced that eternal Life was not to be got by his Works. It is true the young Man &s;ays, <HI>All the&s;e Things have I ob&s;erved from my Youth</HI>; but he &s;hould have &s;aid, All the&s;e Things have I bro|ken from my Youth. If he had never com|mitted

him&s;elf, and make him &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of relying upon another Righteou&s;ne&s;s than his own.</P>
<P>But they &s;ay, Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>loved</HI> this Man, and would he love him if he were not a good Man? No doubt but we are to love every Thing that is good in every Man; but there was a great Difference betwixt the Love that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t bore to this Man, and the Love that he bore to <HI>Lazarus, Martha,</HI> and <HI>Mary.</HI> There be many of you that have &s;weet natural Tempers, and have many good Qualities; a Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t cannot but love you &s;o far as he &s;ees the&s;e Things in you. But there is a great Difference be|twixt the Love that they bear to a moral good Man, and that Love they bear to tho&s;e that are united to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The Love that Chri&s;t bore this young Man was far from that peculiar Love that he bore to all tho&s;e who are united to him. So that, notwith|&s;tanding this Objection, we may &s;ay, <HI>The Lord is our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>There is another Objection taken from the 25<HI>th Matth<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">,</HI> where, &s;ay they, Peo|ple are <HI>judged</HI> by their Works, therefore we are to be ju&s;tified by our Works. But there is no &s;uch Thing here: it is remarkable, be|fore Chri&s;t &s;peaks of their good Works, he determines their State; he places &s;ome on
<PB N="18" REF="005090_0017_1016672386F4DA70">
his right Hand and &s;ome on his left, before he comes to pa&s;s Sentence upon them. We own, that Works done by Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t will be rewarded, and the more good Works we do for the Sake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the greater will our Reward be in the King|dom of Heaven. But then, my dear Friends, it is remarkable, that the&s;e People did not depend upon the&s;e. <HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World; for I was an hungred, and ye gave me Meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me Drink; I was a Stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye cloathed me; I was &s;ick, and ye vi&s;ited me, I was in Pri&s;on, and ye came unto me.</HI>  But that this Reward was of Grace, and that their good Works were only Evidences of their Love to him, and that they did not depend upon them for their Ju&s;tification, is plain, becau&s;e they &s;ay, <HI>When &s;aw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thir&s;ty, and gave the Drink? when &s;aw we thee a Stranger, and took thee in, or naked and cloathed thee? or when &s;aw we thee &s;ick, or in Pri&s;on, and came unto thee?</HI> They were &s;o far from depending upon their Works for Ju&s;tification, that they really forgot that they had done them, and were filled with holy Blu&s;hing, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould mention, much more that he &s;hould reward their little Services, their Tokens of Love to him.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005090_0018_1016A38735586AF8">But then, they retort upon us the latter Part of the Chapter. Je&s;us Chri&s;t damned the one &s;ort for not doing well, and if he damned them for not doing well, it's plain he &s;aved the other for doing well. Which is no good Con&s;equence at all; for, according to the Covenant of Works, one evil Thought cuts off for ever, without another Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s; and after we have done all we can do, we mu&s;t acknowledge our&s;elves <HI>unprofi|table Servants,</HI> and rely upon a better Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s than our own. Tho' the one be ju&s;tly damned for their Sins, yet the other was rewarded only by free Grace, and they all cry out, <HI>Grace, Grace</HI>! Therefore we may &s;ay, <HI>The Lord is our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But Fourthly, there is another Way of arguing; from the <HI>Ab&s;urdities,</HI> that will follow <HI>denying</HI> any Propo&s;ition. And I be|lieve no greater Ab&s;urdities can follow from denying any Propo&s;ition, than do from de|nying this, of imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s. I believe no Body here will think it proper that Man &s;hould <HI>glory in him&s;elf</HI>; but if the Doctrine of imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s be not true, Man mu&s;t glory in him&s;elf. We are every where declared to be &s;aved by Grace, to be ju&s;tified freely; that Man is not to glory in him&s;elf, but that he that glorieth mu&s;t glory in the Lord. If any Thing I
<PB N="20" REF="005090_0019_1016A38A4FD3E528">
can do and &s;uffer can recommend me to the Favour and Mercy of God, I may &s;o far glory in it, and I may &s;ay, not in thee, but in mine own free Will, mine own good Di&s;|po&s;ition do I glory. Therefore if you glory only in the Lord, come out of your&s;elves, and &s;ay, <HI>The Lord our Rigteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Again, I believe we all cry out again&s;t <HI>Popery</HI>; but, my dear Friends, Are we not Papi&s;ts if we deny the Doctrine of an impu|ted Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and exclude the Obedi|ence of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Now &s;uppo&s;e I were to come and preach that Doctrine, that Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s is not &s;ufficient of it|&s;elf, but you mu&s;t get Angels to interceed for you, would you like this Doctrine? would you not &s;ay, this is rank Popery? Sup|po&s;e I &s;hould refine a little on it, and preach this Doctrine, that the Death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not &s;ufficient of it&s;elf, but you mu&s;t join your own Works with Chri&s;t, and then God will have Mercy upon you, would you not &s;ay, This is doing Di&s;honour to the Redee|mer's Death, as if the Death of Chri&s;t were not &s;ufficient? Now make the &s;ame Appli|cation to his Obedience: if it's Bla&s;phemy, to join any thing with the Death of Chri&s;t, is it not equally Bla&s;phemy to join our Obe|dience with the Obedience of Chri&s;t, as if the Obedience of Je&s;us Chri&s;t were not &s;uf|ficient?
<PB N="21" REF="005090_0020_1016A38BE82275B8">
It is plain therefore, that we are Papi&s;ts in our Heart, if we deny the Doc|trine of imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I remember a Story of a Gentleman abroad; after he had been talking of <HI>doing</HI> along Time, the Mini&s;ter endeavoured to convince him of the invi&s;ible Realities of another World; how|ever after a long Conference he parted with the&s;e Words, Well, my Lord, if there be no &s;uch thing as <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> no &s;uch thing as <HI>Hea|ven,</HI> what will become of <HI>me</HI>? But, my Lord, if there be &s;uch a thing as <HI>Hell,</HI> what will become of <HI>you</HI>? I make Application of this to Chri&s;t's imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s. If there be no &s;uch thing as Chri&s;t's imputed Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, as certainly there is, what will become of thee, O Man, that dare build up|on thy rotten Righteou&s;ne&s;s for Salvation? What a fooli&s;h Ab&s;urdity is it, to build up|on the Sand, when you may have a Rock to build upon? <HI>Bellermine</HI> him&s;elf, that great Enemy of imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s, was obli|ged to own and confe&s;s, con&s;idering the Dan|ger of depending upon our own Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, it is &s;afe&s;t to depend upon the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. And certainly it is be&s;t for every Man to follow and choo&s;e that which is &s;afe&s;t. Therefore we may with great Confidence affirm, that <HI>the Lord is our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="005090_0021_1016A38FBAB70D38">Now, my dear Friends, I have been too long upon the doctrinal Part. To preach to your Head, without preaching to your Heart, is doing you no Good. If I know any thing of my Heart, I came not here to tickle your Ears, but to do Good to your Souls; therefore I come to make <HI>Application</HI> of what has been &s;aid. I believe, many of you may rejoice to hear one come from <HI>Eng|land,</HI> (where our Articles are &s;o little re|garded,) &s;peaking on the Doctrine of Chri&s;t's imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Curio&s;ity may have brought you to hear a Stranger. But then, my dear Friends, give me Leave to put one important Que&s;tion, Have you felt this Doc|trine in your Heart? Can you &s;ay, <HI>The Lord is your Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI>? For, to &s;ay that Je&s;us died for others, without you can &s;ay Je&s;us died for you, can do you no Service; an unapplied Chri&s;t will do you no Service. The great Que&s;tion therefore is, Whether any of you have felt your&s;elves damned Sin|ners by Nature? Did you ever feel your mi|&s;erable and helple&s;s Condition? Did you ever &s;ee that you were poor, mi&s;erable, blind and naked? Were you ever hungering and thir&s;ting after the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t? And did God enable you to &s;tretch out the Hand of Faith, to embrace the dear Redee|mer in your Heart? Were you ever in a
<PB N="23" REF="005090_0022_1016A3914664AC48">
Soul-Rapture of Love, made to lye down at the feet of Chri&s;t, and cry out, <HI>My Lord, and my God</HI>? Did you ever apply Chri&s;t &s;o as to &s;ay, <HI>My Lord and my God! Who can lay any Thing to the Charge of God's Elect? It is God that ju&s;tifieth. Who is he that condemn|eth? It is Chri&s;t that died, ye rather that is ri&s;en again.</HI> Without clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t, without making Application of his Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, all your Religion is nothing; you are yet out of Chri&s;t, and if out of Chri&s;t, you are undone. I hope &s;ome of you can &s;ay, through Grace, you have been enabled to lay hold on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and you can &s;ay, <HI>The Lord is our Righteou&s;ne&s;s!</HI> then your Souls may rejoyce. If Chri&s;t be your Lord, if you have put his Righteou&s;ne&s;s upon your naked Souls; then call upon the heavenly Choir to help you to prai&s;e him, and let the Words of your Song be, Free Grace, Grace, Grace! Not unto us, but unto free Grace, di&s;tingui&s;hing Grace, be everla&s;ting Prai&s;e. O what Rea&s;on have you to prai&s;e God! Have you got Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s? have you clo&s;ed with Chri&s;t? Have you put on Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Then Je&s;us Chri&s;t has ta|ken you into his everla&s;ting Arms. Some of you may fear, you &s;hall lo&s;e him again: But depend upon the Promi&s;es, build upon God's everla&s;ting Love. If you have clo|&s;ed
<PB N="24" REF="005090_0023_1016A3940B2410E8">
with Chri&s;t, you have got a Right to all the Benefits of his Blood; and being in Chri&s;t, there is no Condemnation to you; You are Bone of his Bone, and Fle&s;h of his Fle&s;h; you are one with Chri&s;t; he is <HI>the Lord your Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash; Above all, my dear Friends, take Care of making continu|al Progre&s;s in Sanctification. Many of you turn carele&s;s in your Walk; you are back|&s;lidden from God, and now it is not with you as in former Times, when the Candle of the Lord &s;hined upon you: Get up again, renew your Acts of Faith. (And if you have never believed before, then begin now to believe) Take Care to make continual Advances in the Divine Life; for when the Prophet &s;ays, <HI>The Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> the Word <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> implies inward Sanc|tification, Holine&s;s of Heart, as well as im|puted Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Tho&s;e whom the Lord Je&s;us ju&s;tifies, tho&s;e he &s;anctifies. And therefore if ye have clo&s;ed with Chri&s;t, dai|ly <HI>put on Chri&s;t</HI>; be every Day &s;aying, Through the Help of my God I will behave as a Chri&s;tian to Day. Let one good Work be the Beginning of another. And be eve|ry Day hungering and thir&s;ting for Chri&s;t. Be more dead to the World; be more li|ving to God. In a Word, my dear Friends, pray for your Chri&s;tian Friends, and take

Care you do not fall out by the Way.</P>
<P>How many are there here in this very Church-yard, that never clo&s;ed with Je&s;us Chri&s;t by Faith! I fear, the greate&s;t Part of this Congregation do not know what it is &s;avingly to clo&s;e with Je&s;us Chri&s;t: The mo&s;t of you cannot &s;ay, <HI>The Lord is my Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Poor Souls, what will become of you? you are now in a Church-yard, and many a Grave may be dug here for your Bodies; and if you &s;hould die before you can &s;ay, <HI>The Lord is my Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> you mu&s;t depart from Je&s;us Chri&s;t for ever more. You may have a pompous burial; but while your Friends are carrying your Bodies to the Grave, your Souls may be in Hell. What therefore &s;hall I &s;ay? Let me exhort you to examine your Heart, and to &s;ee whe|ther you have got Chri&s;t <HI>the Lord</HI> to be <HI>your Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> or not. Examine your Heart; do not bribe your poor Con&s;cience any lon|ger; let Con&s;cience &s;peak out. You mu&s;t now judge and condemn your&s;elves, or you will be condemned for ever hereafter.

<P>Shall I &s;peak to you, fir&s;t, that are <HI>young</HI> Prodigals, you that are young like my&s;elf. This Call is in a &s;pecial Manner for you.
