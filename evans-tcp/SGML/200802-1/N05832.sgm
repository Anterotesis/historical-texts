<BIBL>I TIMOTHY II. 1, 2.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>I exhort therefore, that fir&s;t of all; Suppli|cations, Prayers, Interce&s;&s;ions, and Giving of Thanks, be made for all Men: For Kings, and for all that are in Authority; that we may lead a quiet, and peaceable Life, in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty.</HI></Q>

<P><HI>_THE End of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure Heart.</HI> And Acts of Kindne&s;s, and Good-Will to Men as the <HI>Off-&s;pring of GOD,</HI> are the proper Fruits of Charity. When therefore our Minds are effectually Influenced by this God-like Vertue, in&s;tead of &s;aying, <HI>go, be warmed, be filled;</HI> we &s;hall &s;incerely Endeavour as we have Opportunity, <HI>to do good to all Men.</HI> But in as much as we
<PB N="2" REF="007407_0005_102BAE124D968BD0">
ha'n't the &s;ame Advantages, to &s;hew the Effects of our Charity to &s;ome, as to o|thers, (for &s;ome are rai&s;ed to &s;uch a Pitch of Grandure, and Dignity, that they are above our Reach; others are at &s;uch a Di&s;tance from us; that we don't &s;o much as know them, or the Nation they belong to; and our Enemies by their Perver&s;ene&s;s, and ill Nature, may render them&s;elves uncapa|ble to receive Benefit by us;) the only way therefore for us to &s;hew our Chri&s;tian Tem|per in &s;uch Ca&s;es, is by our fervent Addre&s;&s;es at the Throne of Grace on their Behalf. But whether we can actually do good to Men, or no; the great Duty of Interce&s;&s;ion for o|thers is not to be neglected; for the mo&s;t that we (or indeed the very Angels them&s;elves,) can do for them, is ju&s;t nothing at all, in Compari&s;on of that great Good, that GOD may be&s;tow upon them, in An&s;wer to our Prayers. We need not marvel therefore, that the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of this, as a Duty of &s;uch great Importance. <HI>I exhort therefore, that fir&s;t of all, Supplications, Prayers, In|terce&s;&s;ions, &amp; giving of Thanks, be made for all Men.</HI> We mu&s;t pray for all Men, Friends, and Enemies, Relations and Strangers, Bond and Free. But as our own Peace, the civil and religious Intere&s;ts of the Community, and the be&s;t good of Rulers them&s;elves, de|pend
<PB N="3" REF="007407_0006_102BAE1482BC1E78">
upon their Conduct; therefore we are e&s;pecially <HI>to pray for Kings, and for all that are in Authority.</HI> And we are directed what to pray for on their Account; <HI>viz.</HI> That they may be Influenced by GOD's Grace, and have his Ble&s;&s;ing upon their Per&s;ons, and Admini&s;trations, that under their Protection <HI>we may lead quiet and peaceable Lives, in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>There are &s;undry things of very great Importance, that we may ob&s;erve from the&s;e Words. Particularly,</P>
<P>That civil Government is a divine In&s;ti|tution, and therefore we mu&s;t pray for GOD's Ble&s;&s;ing upon all that are in Authority, as being GOD's Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>That the Work of Rulers is of great Con|cernment, and attended with peculiar Diffi|culties, and accordingly they &s;tand in need of the Prayers of good Men.</P>
<P>That good Rulers are a great Ble&s;&s;ing to a People, &s;ince under their Influence, and Protection, their civil and religious Intere&s;ts are Secure; &s;o that <HI>they may lead quiet and peaceable Lives, in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>That the People owe Obedience, and Sub|jection to then Rulers; without which they can have no Peace, Godline&s;s, for Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>That Subjects ought not only to acquie&s;ce in, but be thankful for, the good Offices of
<PB N="4" REF="007407_0007_102BAE179617E240">
their Rulers; for Thank&s;giving is to be joyned with Supplications, Prayers, and Interce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>That People are not animated with a chri&s;tian Spirit, nor truly &s;en&s;ible of their own Intere&s;t, when they neglect to pray for their Rulers.</P>
<P>And that all Men ought to Improve the Advantages they enjoy under a good Go|vernment, <HI>by leading a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>Each of the&s;e Ob&s;ervations might be im|proved as a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oper Entertainment, for &s;uch an Occa&s;ion as this; yet I &s;hall not expa|tiate upon either of them: But what I have chiefly in View as the Subject of my Di&s;|cour&s;e, is this;&mdash;</P>
<P>That when civil Rulers are influenced by the Grace of GOD, they will &s;incerely endea|vour to promote not only the Peace, and outward Pro&s;perity; but likewi&s;e the religi|gious Intere&s;ts of the People under their Government.</P>
<P>The Rulers of the World, when this E|pi&s;tle was Written, were Heathen; and the great Thing that their Subjects were to pray for on their Behalf was, that they might be Converted, and &s;o become &s;incere Chri&s;tians, and then it would follow, that under their Government they might lead a quiet, and
<PB N="5" REF="007407_0008_102BAE1997B198F8">
peaceable Life, in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty. And we mu&s;t now pray for <HI>them that rule over Men, that they may be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God;</HI> for if this be their true Cha|racter, we may re&s;t Satisfied that their En|deavours will not be wanting, to &s;ecure to us our ju&s;t Rights, Civil, and Religious.</P>
<P>But that I may expre&s;s my Sentiments upon this Subject, with as much Clearne&s;s, and Brevity as I can; I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how,</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> That the good of Society in this pre|&s;ent State, (next to the Glory of GOD,) is the direct End of civil Government.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> Alth&ocirc; Religion is not the direct, and immediate Object, of the Concern of civil Rulers in their political Capacity; yet the good of Society can never be effectually promoted by them, unle&s;s they are &s;incerely concerned for the Intere&s;t of Religion.</P>
<P>And therefore,</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> When civil Rulers are influenced by the Grace of GOD, to do their Duty; they will &s;incerely endeavour to promote Religion; as there is &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary Con|nexion, between this, and the good of Society.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> That the good of Society in this pre|&s;ent State, (next to the Glory of GOD,) is the direct End of civil Government. Go|vernment
<PB N="6" REF="007407_0009_102BAE1B1A7E97C0">
was not appointed, that &s;ome Men might enjoy Riches, Dignity, and Power above others, exclu&s;ive of the good of the Public: That &s;ome might become as Bea&s;ts of Prey, to the weaker part of the Herd while others mu&s;t be Bea&s;ts of Burden: That &s;ome might <HI>be clothed in Purple, and fine Linen, and fare Sumptuou&s;ly every Day; while others mu&s;t be fed with the Crumbs that fall from their Table.</HI> No; Societies were not formed for the &s;ake of Rulers, but Rulers were made for the &s;ake of Societies; that the good of all, (Rulers and Ruled) in Con|junction, might be Promoted. And as civil Government was not appointed for the good of any Part of a Community, in Oppo&s;ition to the Re&s;t; &s;o it was not de&s;ign'd for the good of any Community as &s;uch, in the World to come. For th&ocirc; <HI>the chief End of Man, is to glorify God and enjoy him for ever:</HI> And the chief End of Government, as well as all other Means that GOD is u&s;ing with Men; is His Glory, and their everla&s;ting Good; and therefore every Man, of every Community, ought to improve this, together with all other Advantages, that he may <HI>be made meet to be a Partaker, of the Inheri|tance of the Saints in Light:</HI> Yet no Society as &s;uch will have a future Exi&s;tence, <HI>in that Kingdom which can never be moved,</HI> and there|fore
<PB N="7" REF="007407_0010_102BAE1D2E54BF90">
can receive neither Good, nor Harm, from this, or any thing el&s;e in that Re&s;pect. <HI>For when the Heavens &s;hall pa&s;s away with a great Noi&s;e, and the Elements &s;hall Melt with fervent Heat, and the Earth al&s;o, and the Works that are therein, &s;hall be burnt up;</HI> When all Nature &s;hall fall on Sleep, Time &s;hall expire, and Death it &s;elf &s;hall die; then Empires, and Kingdoms, and States, and Communities, &s;hall be no more; but glorified Saints &s;hall be united in another Manner of Society, <HI>when God will be all in all.</HI> But Men in this pre&s;ent State of Weakne&s;s, and Depravity, have a mutual Dependance one upon another, and can't Sub&s;i&s;t without the Advantages of civil Society; and this nece&s;&s;a|rily implies, that there mu&s;t be &s;ome Govern|ment: For an animal Body could as well live without an Head, as a political one could &s;ub|&s;i&s;t without Government. For without it we &s;hould be in a &s;tate of Confu&s;ion; like an Herd of wild Bea&s;ts; the Stronge&s;t, and mo&s;t Mi&s;chievous, would Domineer over and Op|pre&s;s others. There would be <HI>no Peace, to him that &s;hould go out, or to him that &s;hould come in;</HI> our Lives, and Properties, and all that is dear to us, would hang in Su&s;pence, and de|pend upon the ungoverned Lu&s;ts of the Sons of Fraud, and Violence. When a People therefore grow unea&s;y under Government, and
<PB N="8" REF="007407_0011_102BAE202B7B06F8">
endeavour to overthrow the Foundations of it; they are like a Pond that being weary of Confinement, contends for Liberty, with the Dam upon which it depends for it's very Ex|i&s;tence. Government is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the very Being of a Society; that it is not at all Probable, that ever any great Number of People continued long together, without it in &s;ome Form or other. To &s;uppo&s;e (as &s;ome have done,) that Mankind were ever in &s;uch a mere State of Nature; as to have had no Laws, no Regulations, no &s;ort of Government; is to &s;uppo&s;e a Contradiction; for &s;uch a wild, and &s;avage State, could not with any Propriety be called a State of Na|ture; for it would be a very unnatural State. And therefore it follows that Government was not brought in by Improvement, and Cultivation, as the Arts and Sciences were. For th&ocirc; it is true, the different Modes, and Forms, of it, (as they are &s;uited to the Genius, Inclination, and Circum&s;tances of every Community,) depend upon Agreement, and Compact: Yet Government it&s;elf, was in&s;tituted at the beginning of the World, by the great Author of our Natures; as is evi|dent from the Word of GOD; and is even implied in tho&s;e Words, <HI>It is not good the Man &s;hould be alone.</HI> For <HI>Adam</HI> was to have had a &s;ort of Government over his Wife and
<PB N="9" REF="007407_0012_102BAE222BCEEF70">
over his Children, if they had been Born in Paradice: For the Fifth Commandment would have been binding then as well as now. But after <HI>that Sin entered into the World,</HI> and Mankind multiplied upon the Earth, the Nece&s;&s;ity of it became more apparent. <HI>As known unto God therefore, are all his Works from the Beginning of the World;</HI> and as he had a tender Concern for Mankind as <HI>his Off-&s;pring,</HI> he made Provi&s;ion for our Peace, and Safety, under the Protection of them who are <HI>Mini&s;ters of God to us for good.</HI> As the civil good of the Community then, ought to be the great Thing aimed at by Rulers as &s;uch; &s;o every thing that has a direct Ten|dency to promote it, ought to be the imme|diate Object of their Concern. There are many things that in their own Nature are ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary to promote the good of Society; th&ocirc; all of them come within the Compa&s;s of civil Liberty; or at lea&s;t are implied by it.</P>
<P>Good Laws ought to be provided; being wi&s;ely adapted to the State, Situation, and Circum&s;tances of the People, and being e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and promulgated, they &s;hould be the Stated Rule of Government, and Obedi|ence. Their Sovereign Authority over all Men, from the Lowe&s;t to the Highe&s;t, ought to be Supported; that the meane&s;t Beggar,
<PB N="10" REF="007407_0013_102BAE23FB14BD98">
as well as the man in Power, may find Refuge under their Protection.</P>
<P>The Doctrines of the unlimited Power of Princes, to govern without Law, and of the Obligations that Subjects are under to &s;ubmit to their lawle&s;s Determinations, upon Pain of eternal Damnation; were in Times pa&s;t greatly in Vogue in our Nation, and taught for precious Go&s;pel Truths.</P>
<P>But their mighty Zeal to propagate the&s;e Doctrines, by a vile Pro&s;titution of Pulpits, Pre&s;&s;es, and Courts of Ju&s;tice, was (methinks,) but a poor way of complimenting the then reigning Princes, for it evidently implied a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that they were endeavouring to oppre&s;s their Subjects, by trampling the Laws under their Feet. But &s;uch was the blind Am|bition of tho&s;e worthle&s;s Princes, that in&s;tead of being affronted they were flattered by the&s;e Men; for they wanted &s;uch In&s;truments to car|ry on their De&s;igns. And if that Lawle&s;s Power which (like original Sin) was propagated from Father to Son, <HI>had not been &s;ent to its own Place,</HI> by the glorious Revolution, and the happy Acce&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent royal Fa|mily to the Throne; it would (long before now) have been more &s;afe for Prote&s;tants to have dwelt in Turkey, than in any Part of the briti&s;h Dominions. <HI>This is the Lord's doing, it is marvellous in our Eyes!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="007407_0014_102BAE2704A1A370">
We find then by Experience, as well as from the Nature of Things, that there can be no civil Liberty, where the &s;acred Authority of the Laws is di&s;regarded by any Order of Men. For as chri&s;tian Liberty does not con|&s;i&s;t, <HI>in turning the Grace of our God into Wan|tonne&s;s;</HI> but in &s;uch due Obedience to the Laws of Chri&s;t, that <HI>we may Serve God without Fear, in Holine&s;s, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, all the Days of our Lives;</HI> &s;o civil Liberty does not con&s;i&s;t in Licentiou&s;ne&s;s; (a wanton abu&s;e of Power on the one Hand, or a fearle&s;s Con|tempt of Authority, on the other) but in &s;uch due Obedience of all Ranks, and Orders of Men, to the wi&s;e and good Laws of the State, that all Men, (Rulers, and Ruled,) that are free from Guilt, may be free from Fear; and may di&s;charge the Duties of their re&s;pective Stations, and enjoy every thing that they have a Right to, without any Concern about <HI>a Lion in the Way, a Lion in the Streets.</HI> Civil Li|berty therefore is &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, that the great End of Government can never be ob|tained, unle&s;s this be inviolably pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>In Order to which the Laws &s;hould not ly by like neglected Armour, but be duly, and im|partially executed. Ju&s;tice &s;hould be done, between Man, and Man; without Fear or Fa|vour, without Bribes, multiplying Charges, or unnece&s;&s;ary Delay. No Special Pleadings
<PB N="12" REF="007407_0015_102BAE2909A65258">
&s;hould be admitted, when the De&s;ign is to keep the Merits of the Cau&s;e out of Sight; and to &s;top the Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice. <HI>But Judg|ment &s;hould run down as Waters, and Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s as a mighty Stream.</HI></P>
<P>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ours of the Law &s;hould be pu|ni&s;hed, according to the Demerit of their Crimes; for their Amendment if they ben't incurable, and that others <HI>may hear, and fear.</HI> And Mercy &s;hould never triumph over Judg|ment, unle&s;s in doubtful Ca&s;es, or when ex|treme right may be extreme wrong.</P>
<P>Indu&s;try and Frugality ought to be promo|ted, the Poor &s;hould be imployed, Children &s;hould be brought up to &s;ome proper Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; that every Member of the Commu|nity may &s;erve it's Intere&s;ts. Trade &amp; Na|vigation &s;hould be encouraged, but withal du|ly regulated, that a great Part of the Pro|duce of a Country, that affords all the Nece&s;|&s;aries of Life, ma'n't be fooli&s;hly bartered a|way, for &s;uch things as only tend to promote Idlene&s;s, Luxury, and Intemperance; whereby they will unavoidably lo&s;e the Ballance of Trade, <HI>and Poverty will ru&s;h on like an armed Man.</HI></P>
<P>A fixed Medium of Trade &s;hould be pro|vided, that Men may not defraud one another under Colour of Law; at the Expence of the public Faith, and Credit.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="007407_0016_102BAE2B0C214150">
Schools and Colleges &s;hould be Supported, for the educating Youth in the learned Lan|guages, and in the liberal Arts, and Sciences; <HI>that Darkne&s;s may not cover the Land, and thick Darkne&s;s the People;</HI> and that &s;ome may be fitted from Time to Time, for public improvement.</P>
<P>A mutual Dependance between every Part, and Member of the political Body, &s;hould be pre&s;erved; that the Head may direct, and influence the Members, and that all the Mem|bers may be &s;ubject to the Head; and mutu|ally a&s;&s;i&s;t each other. When ever this Depen|dence is lo&s;t; &s;o that <HI>the Eye &s;ays to the Hand I have no need of thee, and the Head &s;ays to the Feet, I have no need of you;</HI> the Light of civil Liberty will become dim, and the Health of the Body will be &s;o impaired, that there will be a Stagnation of the vital Fluids, and every fatal Symptom of approaching Death.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, proper Mea&s;ures &s;hould be con|certed, for the Defence of the Lives, and Pro|perties of the People, again&s;t the open Inva|&s;ions, or &s;ecret Attempts of Enemies; for th&ocirc; no War ought to be made to gratify the Lu&s;t of Ambition, to obtain Dominion, or enlarge Territories, or even for the Propagating Re|ligion it&s;elf: Yet &s;elf Defence is agreeable to the Law of Nature, and an Offen&s;ive War is lawful, &s;o far as it is nece&s;&s;ary, in the ju&s;t De|fence
<PB N="14" REF="007407_0017_102BAE2C8E497880">
of our&s;elves and others. The Doctrine of the unlawfulne&s;s of a Defen&s;ive War, which &s;ome have placed among the Articles of their Creed; is contrary both to the Old Te&s;tament and the New. When the Soldiers being concerned about their eternal Salvation, enqui|red of John Bapti&s;t what they &s;hould do; he was &s;o far from telling them that their Im|ployment was unlawful, that he gave them Directions how they &s;hould behave in it. And when <HI>Peter</HI> was &s;ent by the immediate Command of GOD, to in&s;truct <HI>Cornelius</HI> the Centurian in the Doctrins, and Duties of the Chri&s;tian Religion; he &s;aid nothing again&s;t the &s;ervice he was in as a military Officer; but his whole Conduct &s;hewed that he appro|ved of <HI>his continuing in the Calling, wherein he was called.</HI> And by the Way, if ever it was lawful and nece&s;&s;ary to draw the Sword, it ap|pears to be &s;o now; when our Religion, our Li|berties, our Properties, our Wives, our Chil|dren, and every thing that is dear to us, are in Danger of being buried under the Ruins of our Country. Mu&s;t we as idle Spectators, behold one of the mo&s;t treacherous, and en|terprizing Nations in the World, &s;urrounding us with an armed Force; fortifying them&s;elves in our Provinces; de&s;troying our Forts; and in&s;tigating the Savage Nations to joyn with them in murdering us in a Time of Peace?
<PB N="15" REF="007407_0018_102BAE2FD7503748">
Mu&s;t we &s;it &s;till, and tamely &s;uffer our Coun|try to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, by Men who never knew the Plea&s;ure of having any thing that they could properly call their own; our Towns to be filled with unwelcome Inhabitants; our Hou&s;es to become the Habitations of Cruel|ty; our Wives and Children to be murdered, our Men to have their <HI>Garments rolled in Blood;</HI> our Churches demoli&s;hed, or turned in|to Ma&s;s-Hou&s;es; and our &s;elves if &s;uffered to breathe, to become the Servants of Servants; mu&s;t we counteract all the &s;entiments of Hu|manity; all the Principles of Self-Pre&s;ervati|on, all natural Affection for our Po&s;terity, and all Concern for our Country, Friends and Neighbours? No, we have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t; the Go&s;pel it is true, requires us to love our Enemies, but it does not require us to ex|pre&s;s it, by being acce&s;&s;ary to their Wicked|ne&s;s, or by being cruel to our&s;elves, and to our Friends.

<P>But alth&ocirc; in this Sen&s;e, civil Rulers have no Right to intermeddle with the things of Re|ligion, by invading the mini&s;terial Office; yet in another Intendment, they ought to be greatly concerned about Religion by Virtue of their Office; as they never can effectually promote the Peace, and Pro&s;perity of the Community, without being concerned for the Intere&s;t of Religion.

<P><HI>III.</HI> When civil Rulers are influenced by the Grace of GOD, to do their Duty, they will &s;incerely Endeavour to promote Religion, as there is &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary Connexion, between this, and the good of Society. The Grace of GOD is <HI>that Wi&s;dom that is from above, which is fir&s;t pure, and then peaceable gentle, ea&s;ie to be intreated, full of Mercy, and good Fruits, without Partiality, and without Hypocri&s;y.</HI> It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to make Men really good, in every Bu&s;ine&s;s, and in every Relation of Life. It will make Men good Ma&s;ters, good Parents, good Neighbours, good Mi|ni&s;ters, good Magi&s;trates, and good Subjects. It has a mighty transforming Efficacy; It will turn Rebels, and Traitors, into loyal and
<PB N="22" REF="007407_0025_102BAE3DA9389108">
obedient Subjects: fierce and cruel Savages, into kind Benefactors: and Tyrants, Per&s;ecu|tors, and Oppre&s;&s;ors, into <HI>nur&s;ing Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>The Grace of GOD will refine the Minds, and enlarge the Hearts, of Men in Power. It will rai&s;e them above any low, &s;elfi&s;h, mer|cenary Views; and give them more exalted and &s;ublime Sentiments; &s;o as to con&s;ider them&s;elves as <HI>God's Mini&s;ters,</HI> ve&s;ted with his Authority, and acting for Him, and their greate&s;t Concern will be, <HI>not to lade them|&s;elves with thick Clay;</HI> nor to gain the vain Applau&s;es of Men, (who&s;e Tongues are ven|dible, and who&s;e Affections are as mutable as the Wind) but the Approbation of GOD, whom they con&s;ider as their Witne&s;s, and Judge, <HI>their Shield, and exceeding great Re|ward.</HI></P>
<P>Their Aims, and Views will not be confi|ned to this little Spot of Earth; or within the Compa&s;s of a few Moments of Time; but their Pro&s;pect will extend to the Enjoy|ments of a boundle&s;s Duration.</P>
<P>It will fill them with a tender Affection, and &s;incere Concern for all Mankind; but more e&s;pecially for the People that they are &s;o nearly related to, and will give them a fellow Feeling, and Sympathy with the re&s;t of the Body, both in Pro&s;perity and Adver|&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="007407_0026_102BAE3FDE278F08">
It will enliven their Zeal, animate their Courage, and quicken their Activity, to pro|mote the public good: And as they know by Experience the Nece&s;&s;ity of Religion, to make Men good Members of Society, they will exert them&s;elves to promote it.</P>
<P>But then the great Que&s;tion is, Since Re|ligion is not the direct Object of the Concern of the civil Magi&s;trate in his political Capa|city, what may he, or what ought he to do to promote it?</P>
<P>A full Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this important Que&s;ti|on, would take more Time than this Occa&s;ion will allow: And be&s;ides I am not &s;o &s;anguine, as to imagine, that I can draw the Line with &s;uch Clearne&s;s, and Exactne&s;s that the contending Parties will abide by it, as the true Boundary. But however, I &s;hall venture to &s;ugge&s;t a few things, which may perhaps, give &s;ome Light, in the Ca&s;e. And accordingly I would Ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. That no civil Magi&s;trate has Authority to puni&s;h Men, for their religious Principles, or Practices, provided they don't di&s;turb the civil Peace. The Right that all Men have as moral Agents, and accountable Creatures, to think, and act for them&s;elves in tho&s;e things that relate to their own eternal Salva|tion, is now much better under&s;tood, and more freely acknowledged, than formerly,
<PB N="24" REF="007407_0027_102BAE420AA54010">
when Bigotry was too often Sub&s;tituted, in the Room of that Zeal, which Springs from the Love of GOD, and our Neighbour. It is now generally acknowledged by Prote&s;tants, of every Denomination, that all Per&s;ecution merely upon the Account of Religion, is an unmerciful Violation, of the Law of Nature, and of the <HI>Law of Chri&s;t.</HI> And as there are eternal Rewards, or Puni&s;hments annexed to our Belief, and Practice; that civil Magi&s;trate, who would compel Men to comply with his religious Sentiments, &s;hould give them good Security, that if they are mi&s;led, he will &s;uf|fer for them a vicarious Puni&s;hment, in the <HI>World to come,</HI> and that they &s;hall be guiltle&s;s. For if we mu&s;t believe by Proxy, what Rea|&s;on can be given why we &s;hould not be rewarded, or puni&s;hed by Proxy? If the Ma|gi&s;trate had a ju&s;t Claim to Infallibility, he aught have &s;omething more to &s;ay, <HI>for afflic|ting Mens Bodies for the good of their Souls.</HI></P>
<P>But as we are (at be&s;t) but in a very imperfect State, while we <HI>dwell in Hou&s;es of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ay,</HI> the Condition of our Nature might teach us Humility, and mutual Forbearance, rather than to a&s;&s;ume to our&s;elves (what the Apo&s;tles utterly di&s;claimed) <HI>a Dominion over Mens Faith.</HI> Mens Minds ben't all ca&s;t in the &s;ame Mould; but they have different Capacities, different Tempers, and different
<PB N="25" REF="007407_0028_102BAE4512BD4978">
Advantages, of Education, Reading, and Conver&s;ation; and therefore different Prin|ciples: And all the Severities that can be inflicted upon Mens Bodies, will in no wi&s;e enlighten their Minds, and change their Hearts: The utmo&s;t that can be done there|fore in this way is to bring Men to a Con|formity in Hypocri&s;y. But be&s;ides if one Magi&s;trate has a Right to puni&s;h Men for their Heterodoxy, another who &s;u&s;tains the &s;ame Office, has as much Right to u&s;e the &s;ame Power, and upon this Foot, all the Per&s;ecutions that have ever been in the World, may be ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>Among the Jews Idolaters were to be put to Death, it is true; but then they were a Theocracy, and Idolatry &s;o far as it was re|ceived, &s;o far it de&s;troyed their Polity, civil, as well as religious. But now as there is not the &s;ame Rea&s;on, there can't be the &s;ame Law.</P>
<P>The chri&s;tian Religion never was promo|ted by per&s;ecuting others. The Church may be made <HI>Drunk</HI> (as the Scripture expre&s;&s;es it) but will never thrive, by being fed with the Blood of human Sacrifices; in&s;tead of the <HI>&s;incere Milk of the Word.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the <HI>Meekne&s;s and Gentlene&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> that he never forced any Man to re|ceive his Religion, th&ocirc; he could have em|ployed, <HI>more than twelve Legions of Angels
<PB N="26" REF="007407_0029_102BAE4712BF7FE0">
to compel Men to come in,</HI> if this method had been agreeable to the Nature and De&s;ign of it: But in&s;tead of this; when his Di&s;ciples di&s;covered a per&s;ecuting Temper, towards Men who <HI>Wor&s;hipped they knew not what;</HI> He &s;everely reproved them; <HI>Ye know not (&s;ays He) what manner of Spirit ye are of.</HI></P>
<P>And the Apo&s;tles when they went forth to propagate the Go&s;pel, (being then fully ac|quainted with the Nature, and De&s;ign of it) a&s;&s;ured their Hearers, <HI>that the Weapons of their Warfare were not Carnal,</HI> but Spiritual; and that if <HI>the Mighty Works</HI> that were wrought by them, and <HI>the Preaching of the Go&s;pel with Demon&s;tration, and Power,</HI> were not &s;ufficient to convert them, they would leave them to the Delu&s;ions of <HI>a reprobate Mind.</HI> But if their Hearers had known at the &s;ame Time, that when once the Rulers of the World would joyn with them; it was their real De&s;ign; and agreable to their true Principles, to convert Men with Fire, and Sword, Bonds and Impri&s;onments; I gue&s;s, they would hardly have thought, they were <HI>as harmle&s;s as Doves;</HI> how much &s;o ever they might have, of <HI>the Wi&s;dom of the Serpent:</HI> Neither would they have thought, they de&s;erved the Character our Saviour gave them, when he &s;aid&punc; <HI>behold I &s;end you forth, as Lambs among Wolves.</HI> But I add,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="27" REF="007407_0030_102BAE48A49A1A18">
2. The civil Magi&s;trate has no Right to make any Alterations, either in the Doctrins, Di&s;cipline, or Ordinances of Religion; for the &s;ake of promoting the good of the State, or for any other Pretence what&s;oever. The chri&s;tian Religion in its native Purity, and Simplicity, has not been at all agreeable to the Gu&s;t of, curious Projectors: And hence Work enough has been found for the fruit|ful Inventions of Men, that they might mix &s;ome Ingredients to make it more palatable; either from a Pretence of Order, Unity, and Decency; or to accommodate it to the Temper of the People; or to promote the Schemes of Politicians. King JAMES the fir&s;t from political Views, had a great Fondne&s;s for the epi&s;copal Form of Church Govern|ment. It was his darling Maxim, no Bi&s;hop, no King. But another (who was &s;o far from being a Puny in Politicks, that he placed him&s;elf at the Head of three Kingdoms, and cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be wor&s;hipped, not only a|mong, but even by the Gods of the Earth) had a very different View, he thought it was ab&s;urd, and dangerous to &s;et up Imperium in Imperio; a Form of Government in the Church, to rival that of the State. But I imagine they were both very wrong, in ma|king Religion the Creature of the State, when it ought to have be'n the Pillar, and Founda|tion
<PB N="28" REF="007407_0031_102BAE4B36FB5528">
of it. For the chri&s;tian Religion does not depend upon the capricious Fancies of States men; or the Refinements of Politi|cians; (for if &s;o, it would be as fluctuating as the Waves of the Sea) but it is, what it is, a glorious Scheme of Salvation, contrived, and in&s;tituted by infinite Wi&s;dom, in all the Parts of it; to promote the Glory of its di|vine Author, and the pre&s;ent Peace, and everla&s;ting Happine&s;s of Men.</P>
<P>There is a re&s;plendent Glory, that Shines round the chri&s;tian Religion; &s;o that it is <HI>all glorious</HI> without; as well as <HI>all glorious within.</HI> The Angels behold it with humble Admira|tion, tho' men, ungrateful Men treat it as an old fa&s;hioned thing <HI>without Form, and Com|line&s;s.</HI> But as counterfeit Colours, how art|fully &s;oever laid on, would tarni&s;h, and de|face an exqui&s;ite natural Beauty; &s;o all the Ornaments, and Decorations that have be'n, or can be contrived, to make Chri&s;t's In&s;titu|tions more decent, and fa&s;hionable; &s;erve to no other Purpo&s;e, but to hide their true Beau|ty, and Glory; and to &s;how the Pre&s;umption, and di&s;tempered Imaginations of the Authors and Contrivers of them. And indeed, it would be a bold Inva&s;ion of Chri&s;t's Kingly Office, and a daring Impeachment of his Wi&s;dom, to pretend to make any Amend|ments in his Ordinances, let the Pretence be
<PB N="29" REF="007407_0032_102BAE4DC8590238">
ever &s;o Specious. In the&s;e things then, <HI>we mu&s;t call no Man Ma&s;ter on Earth, for one is our Ma&s;ter, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and we mu&s;t &s;tand fa&s;t in the Liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free, and not be entangled with the Yoke of Bondage.</HI> When we do <HI>what&s;oever Chri&s;t hath commanded,</HI> we are in a &s;tate of Liberty; but when we are <HI>&s;o beguiled</HI> as to Submit our Necks to the Yoke of human Impo&s;itions, in the Wor&s;hip of GOD, as our Wor&s;hip will be &s;o far a vain Wor&s;hip; &s;o we &s;hall oe in <HI>Bon|dage to Men,</HI> who may without End, make one indifferent Thing Nece&s;&s;ary, as well as another. The &s;ame tran&s;ub&s;tantiating Power, that can change the Nature of one indifferent thing can another, until all the Fopperies of the Church of Rome, will become nece&s;&s;ary Go&s;pel Ordinances. In a Word then, what|&s;oever Chri&s;t has required of us, either by the Law of Nature, or by his Written Word, ought to be a Part of our Religion; <HI>but what&s;oever is more than the&s;e cometh of evil;</HI> and therefore indifferent things ought to re|main as they are, without any Stamp of hu|man Authority to give them a Currency. This is (I think) the only firm Foundation, on which the Peace, and Purity of the Church can be Built.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Magi&s;trate has no Right by Virtue of his Office, to intermeddle with the Di&s;ci|pline
<PB N="30" REF="007407_0033_102BAE4F4A56B2B0">
of the Church. As Chri&s;t is the only King in his Church, He has appointed a dif|ferent Order of Men to be Officers therein: And he has committed unto them the <HI>Key</HI> of Di&s;cipline, as well as the <HI>Key</HI> of Doctrine. All therefore that would <HI>live Godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> are required <HI>to obey them who have the Rule over them, and &s;ubmit them&s;elves&punc; for they watch for their Souls as they that mu&s;t give Account.</HI> CHRIST's Kingdom is not a Worldly, but a Spiritual Kingdom, &s;et up in the Hearts, and Con&s;ciences of Men; and all his true Subjects are <HI>a willing People:</HI> And no external Force, or Violence is to be u&s;ed with Men to keep them within the Church, any more than to bring them in. But when Di&s;cipline (which is a Spiritual Thing,) has been u&s;ed with &s;uch as are guilty of Here&s;y, or Scandal, for their &s;piritual Good, and the Good of others; <HI>for Edification, and not for De&s;truction;</HI> if after all, <HI>the unbelieving depart, let them depart, &amp; remain as Heathen Men and Publicans.</HI> If they &s;hould be br&ocirc;t to a Submi&s;&s;ion, by Fines, and Impri&s;on|ments, it would be an Argument of their Hypocri&s;y; but not of their <HI>Repentance to|wards God, &amp; Faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and therefore &s;uch a forced Submi&s;&s;i|on, would in no wife qualify them for Com|munion with the Church of CHRIST. But
<PB N="31" REF="007407_0034_102BAE5167A3CFD8">
the&s;e things being premi&s;ed, I proceed to &s;ay; that there are many things notwith&s;tanding, that ought to be done by civil Rulers by Virtue of their Office, to promote Religion.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">(1) They ought to publickly own and Sup|port the chri&s;tian Religion, in &s;uch a Way as they think, (according to the be&s;t Light they can get from the Word of GOD) to be mo&s;t agreable to the Mind, and Will of the great Governor of the World; and therefore would be&s;t an&s;wer the Ends of Government. There is a great Difference between a Tole|ration, and an E&s;tabli&s;hment. Every Religion that don't di&s;turb the civil Peace ought to be tolerated, but not e&s;tabli&s;hed, and &s;upported at the public Charge. But as the chri&s;tian Religion ought to be owned, and profe&s;&s;ed by all Men, &s;o it &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed and &s;upported by public Authority. The glory of GOD, and the good of Society, as well as the eternal Salvation of the Souls of Men; make it evident that &s;uch a pure and merciful Religion, which was publi&s;hed by the Son of GOD, ought to be publickly received with due Deference, and Re&s;pect; and not be put upon a Level with mere Heatheni&s;m. But if civil Rulers have nothing to do to provide for the Support of Religion, but every Man mu&s;t be allowed to act in this Ca&s;e, as his
<PB N="32" REF="007407_0035_102BAE53E7A8FFF8">
own Prejudice, or Avarice may incline him; what can they do by virtue of their Office, to &s;hew their Re&s;pect to the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion more than to mere Heatheni&s;m? And how can Rulers an&s;wer the Character that is given of Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trates, in the Word of GOD; if they are not to provide for the Support of Religion? Don't we read, <HI>that kings &s;hould be Nur&s;ing Fathers, and Queens &s;hould be Nur&s;ing Mothers,</HI> to the Church, and People of GOD, under the Go&s;pel Di&s;|pen&s;ation?</P>
<P>But then, the religious E&s;tabli&s;hment ought to be founded upon &s;uch a broad Bottom, and under&s;tood in &s;uch a Latitude, that all good Chri&s;tians notwith&s;tanding their different Sentiments, may receive Benefit by it. Men may be &s;incere Chri&s;tians, and therefore very u&s;eful Members of the political Body; tho' they may be mi&s;taken with Re&s;pect to &s;ome circum&s;tantial things in Religion: They may <HI>build Wood, Hay, and Stubble,</HI> (as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it) upon the true Foundation. In this Ca&s;e the Law of Charity, (which is in a peculiar Man|ner the <HI>Law of Chri&s;t</HI>) requires us <HI>to bear one anothers Burdens, and receive one a|nother, as Chri&s;t al&s;o receives us.</HI> Uniformity in all the Externals of Religion, would be ve|ry de&s;irable, if we could all think alike; but

as this is not to be expected in this pre&s;ent State of Imperfection; a Law of Comprehen|&s;ion, would be much more agreable to the De|&s;ign of the chri&s;tian Religion, (which is to unite Men to Chri&s;t by Faith, and to one another by Charity) than a Law of &s;trict Uniformity, whereby Men mu&s;t be obliged to act alike, whatever their Thoughts are. And therefore as the Terms of Chri&s;tianity, and Nothing el&s;e, ought to be the Terms of Communion in the Church of Chri&s;t; &s;o the Religion of CHRIST, and Nothing el&s;e, ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed under the Notion of Religion in a chri&s;tian State. And as all chri&s;tian Churches have a Right to Judge for them&s;elves, what are the Terms of Chri&s;tianity, and therefore what Qualifications are nece&s;&s;ary in their own Members; &s;o the Legi&s;lature of every chri|&s;tian State, have a right to judge what is the Religion of CHRIST, and what Principles, and Practi&s;es may ju&s;tly exclude Men from the Privileges of a religious E&s;tabli&s;hment. For if every Man ought to have the Liberty of private Judgment, then every Community ought to have the Liberty of public Judg|ment: The Legi&s;lature ought to have as much Liberty of Con&s;cience to think for them&s;elves, what will be for the public good, as every Man ought to have; that he may think for him&s;elf what will be for his own
<PB N="34" REF="007407_0037_102BAE56F9967650">
good. And therefore it will follow, that if the Legi&s;lature mu&s;t be obliged to receive Men as Chri&s;tians, (who profe&s;s a Religion that tends to the be&s;t good of the State) when they believe in their Con&s;cience, that their profe&s;&s;ed Principles, and Practi&s;es, are incon|&s;i&s;tant with Chri&s;tianity, and &s;o with the good of the State; they have no Liberty of Con|&s;cience: And upon the &s;ame Suppo&s;ition, there could be no Di&s;cipline in the Church, nor any Religion at all e&s;tabli&s;hed, and &s;up|ported in the State; but every Man mu&s;t be left to his own Fancy, or Humour, and be intitled to equal Authority, and equal Privi|leges with others, let him be an Athei&s;t, or a Dei&s;t, a Papi&s;t, or an Heathen, any Thing, or Nothing. And indeed upon this Suppo|&s;ition, there could be no &s;uch thing as a chri|&s;tian State, unle&s;s there may be a Chri&s;tian State, that do'n't (as &s;uch,) profe&s;s the chri&s;tian Religion. But upon the whole, as the religious E&s;tabli&s;hment, ought to be found|ed upon charitable Principles, otherwi&s;e it would not be Suited to the Temper of the Go&s;pel; &s;o they who don't think fit to com|ply with it, ought <HI>to lead a quiet, and peace|able Life,</HI> and be contented with a Toleration. And they not think it hard, if they are obliged to bear a Part in the public Charges, that are thought nece&s;&s;ary by the proper

Judges to promote the good of the Public; <HI>for in the Peace thereof, they them&s;elves &s;hall have Peace.</HI> Again,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) They who are in Authority, ought to take care of the public Wor&s;hip of GOD, and oblige all that are under their Government, to &s;teadily, and orderly attend upon his public Wor&s;hip, in &s;ome way, and manner agreable to their Profe&s;&s;ion; when they have the Ad|vantage, and Opportunity for it. It is ab&s;urd, to &s;peak of allowing Athei&s;ts Liberty of Con|&s;cience. Becau&s;e he who profe&s;&s;eth him&s;elf to be an Athei&s;t, at the &s;ame Time profe&s;&s;es that he has no Con&s;cience. For what Con|&s;cience can a Man have; who believes there is no GOD, no moral Obligations, no future Rewards, and Puni&s;hments? But whatever Men Profe&s;s with their Mouths, their refu&s;ing to wor&s;hip GOD in Public, is a practical Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Athei&s;m. For altho' there have been &s;ome, who have &s;o far &s;unk into Brutality as to deny the Being, and Perfections of GOD; Yet there never were any that did believe the Being of a GOD, of infinite Perfections, and at the &s;ame Time believe that he ought not to be Wor&s;hipped. And as GOD hath appointed one Day in Seven, for his more immediate Wor&s;hip, and Service, due care &s;hould be taken by civil Rulers, that the Chri&s;tian Sab|bath be not Prophaned. Experience &s;hews,
<PB N="36" REF="007407_0039_102BAE5B85680498">
that a due Sanctification of the Lord's-Day, has a mighty Influence upon the Manners of the People; and that all practical Religion, will &s;tand, or fall according as it is ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>I add,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Every Word, and every Action, that in an open &amp; profane Manner, di&s;covers a Con|tempt of GOD, and Religion, is an Iniquity that ought to be <HI>puni&s;hed by the Judge.</HI> Not only vile Swearers, <HI>who &s;et their Mouth again&s;t the Heavens;</HI> and prophane De&s;pi&s;ers of GOD, who in a way of Defiance, call upon their Maker, to exert his Almighty Power in the Damnation of them&s;elves, and others; but even Scoffers, who make a mock of Sacred Things, ought to be treated as Enemies to GOD, and human Society. Religion is a very &s;erious Thing, and it would be very unchri&s;tian, as well as uncivil, to Mock and Deride Men for their religious Princi|ples, and Practi&s;es, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be wrong: in&s;tead of this, we ought to pity them, and pray for them, and u&s;e proper Methods to convince them of their Mi&s;|takes. But as the chri&s;tian Religion will certainly &s;tand its Ground, if it may have a fair Trial at the Bar of Rea&s;on, and is pub|lickly owned as the Religion of the State; no Man ought to be allowed with Impunity to treat it in a flouting, and &s;coffing Manner.
<PB N="37" REF="007407_0040_102BAE5D87AB8BF8">
And the like may be &s;aid with re&s;pect to the Rule of our Faith, the Holy Scriptures; and the Ordinances of Religion; which are &s;ome|times treated with &s;uch <HI>railing Accu&s;ations, as Michael the Archangel would not bring again&s;t the Devil him&s;elf.</HI> This Method has be'n the principal Engine that has be'n made u&s;e of, to batter down the Bulwarks of our Faith, and to propagate Infidelity. Th&ocirc; I hope this has not been &s;o common among us, as in &s;ome other Places; but if the Floodgates &s;hould be &s;et open, or the Banks &s;hould be removed, what can we expect, but to be de|luged with a Flood of Impiety? And,</P>
<P N="4">(4.) Civil Rulers &s;hould u&s;e all proper Endeavours to &s;trengthen the Hands, and encourage the Hearts, of the Mini&s;ters of Religion. Thus <HI>King Hezekiah, &s;pake com|fortably to all the Levites, that taught the good Knowlege of the Lord.</HI> The magi&s;terial, and mini&s;terial Authority, are very different, in their Nature, and Kind; but yet in&s;tead of rivaling one another, when they are duly im|proved, they will be very helpful; and &s;ub|&s;ervient each to the other. <HI>Thus God led his People like a Flock, by the Hand of Mo&s;es, and Aaron.</HI> The civil, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical Autho|rity, were united in promoting the good of that People. If Mini&s;ters are faithful, and &s;ucce&s;sful, they will be greatly In&s;trumental
<PB N="38" REF="007407_0041_102BAE5FCFB73D38">
to pre&s;erve the Peace of the State, and to promote the Honour, and Obedience which the People owe to their Rulers. For the more real Succe&s;s they have in their Work, the more Con&s;cientious People will be, to di&s;charge every Duty, in every Relation of Life, <HI>that they may render to all their Dues: Tribute to whom Tribute is due; Cu&s;tom to whom Cu&s;tom; Fear to whom Fear; Honour to whom Honour.</HI> And therefore good Po|licy, as well as the expre&s;s Command, and Or|dination of Chri&s;t, requires that they &s;hould be Encouraged, and Supported.</P>
<P><HI>I tru&s;t we are not &s;eeking great things for our&s;elves: We are not in the Pur&s;uit of Riches, nor worldly Promotions.

No; all that we de&s;ire is, that we may be con&s;idered, (as we always have be'n) upon the Account of our Office, as u&s;eful, and nece&s;&s;ary Members of the Commu|nity; and that as &s;uch, we may be enabled to lead a quiet and a peaceable Life, not in Pomp, and Luxury, but in the humble and decent Exerci&s;e of our Mini&s;try, which calls for all our Time and Talents.</HI> Again,</P>

(5.) Civil Rulers ought to provide, Sup|port, and regulate the proper Means of Edu|cation; that there may be a Succe&s;&s;ion of well qualified Men in the Sacred Mini&s;try. Schools, and Colleges for the Education of Youth, are nece&s;&s;ary that Men may be fitted for public Offices in the State; (as I ob&s;erved) but they are more e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary that Men may be fitted for the Service of the Sanctuary.

<P>There are &s;ome (we know,) who de&s;pi&s;e Learning, and &s;peak of Colleges with the ut|mo&s;t Contempt.

<P>But as Learning is not the only nece&s;&s;ary Qualification for the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, there|fore Colleges, and Schools of Learning &s;hould be kept under, &s;uch religious Re|gulations, that they may be Nur&s;uries of Ver|tue, and true Religion. For if the&s;e Foun|tains are poi&s;oned with Error, or corrupted with Vice, what can we expect of the Streams that are to water the Sanctuary?</P>
<P N="6">(6.) Civil Rulers of the highe&s;t Rank, ought to imploy Men that are friendly to Re|ligion, in &s;ubordinate Places of Power, and Tru&s;t. Men of corrupt Principles, &s;ubver|&s;ive of the Religion of the State; or that are irreligious in their Behaviour, are unfit to be imployed in Places of Power, and Tru&s;t.

<P N="7">(7.) Civil Rulers &s;hould endeavour to pro|mote Religion by an unblemi&s;hed, exemplary Conver&s;ation. Examples operate in a Way that is hard to de&s;cribe, but yet they have a very powerful Influence upon others, and e&s;pecially the Examples of Men of high Rank and Dignity. If the Sins of Rulers <HI>go before hand to Judgment;</HI> if they &s;hew a Contempt of GOD, and Religion, and live in the Indul|gence of fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts; their Examples will <HI>be a De&s;truction that will wa&s;t at Noon-Day;</HI> and they them&s;elves in&s;tead of being Lights in the World, will be no better than an Ignis fatuus, a fal&s;e Blaze, to bewilder others in the Darkne&s;s of the Night; until they go out <HI>in utter Darkne&s;s,</HI> and their deluded Followers <HI>&s;tumble upon the dark Mountains.</HI> But on the other Hand, when they become bright Examples of undi&s;&s;embled Piety, and of all that is truly great, &amp; good; they will appear <HI>as burning and &s;hining Lights, to revive, and cheri&s;h Religion in others.

<P><HI>I.</HI> We may learn from what has be'n ob|&s;erved, that it ought to be the great Care, and Concern of them who are in Authority in this Community; to &s;uppre&s;s, or remove every thing that is hurtful to Religion among us.

<P>When this Sin becomes common among a People, and is connived at, it is in vain for them to expect that the LORD will be their GOD. <HI>Will ye</HI> (&s;ays GOD by the Mouth of his Prophet)&mdash;<HI>Swear fal&s;ely&mdash;and come and &s;tand before me, in this Hou&s;e that is called by my Name!</HI></P>
<P>But I &s;hall add but one Remark further upon this head, and that is, that if ever this Ca&s;e required the Attention of the Legi&s;la|ture, without Doubt it does now; as there are &s;o many Per&s;ons, that have their Minds &s;o much ruffled, with Prejudice, and Pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="50" REF="007407_0053_102BAE7A95DF4228">
that they appear to be utterly uncapable to act with that Seriou&s;ne&s;s, and Solemnity that they ought to do, when they have given their Souls as a Pledge, to be di&s;po&s;ed of by Him <HI>who judgeth righteou&s;ly,</HI> according as they ob&s;erve their Oath; and when they are in &s;uch amazing Danger, of <HI>trea&s;uring up to them&s;elves Wrath, again&s;t the Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>But, whether it be thought, that what I have Sugge&s;ted, proceeds from a well regu|lated Zeal, or from an over-heated Imagina|tion; I have this to &s;ay, I have no wor&s;e Motive (that I know of;) than a compa&s;&s;io|nate Concern for the Souls of Men, and an hearty Regard to the be&s;t good of the Com|munity; and I pray GOD that all that are under the Obligations of this, or any other Oath, may duly con&s;ider, that <HI>the Judge &s;tands before the Door;</HI> and that the Time is approaching, when GOD will certainly di&s;tin|gui&s;h, <HI>between him that Sweareth, and him that feareth an Oath; and that he will not hold him guiltle&s;s that taketh his Name in Vain.</HI></P>
<P>But,</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> If civil Rulers in their political Capa|city, ought to u&s;e their &s;incere Endeavours to promote Religion, we may then learn,
<PB N="51" REF="007407_0054_102BAE7C9FF59078">
what inviolable Obligations the Mini&s;ters of Religion, are under to devote them&s;elves wholly to the Service of it. Religion ought to be the direct, and immediate Object of our Concern, <HI>as Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, and Stewards of the My&s;teries of GOD.</HI> We are employed in this Work, that we may be the Means of enlarging the Redeemer's King|dom, <HI>and of making ready a People prepared for the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>it plea&s;es GOD by the Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Preaching, to Save them that believe; we mu&s;t warn every Man, and teach every Man, in all Wi&s;dom, that we may pre&s;ent every Man, Perfect in CHRIST JESUS.</HI> Our Work is great, and of va&s;t Importance to the Souls of Men: <HI>To &s;ome we are a &s;avour of Life, unto Life; and to others a &s;avour of Death, unto Death; and who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things?</HI></P>
<P>May GOD give us a due Sen&s;e of the Im|portance of our Work, the Worth of preci|ous and immortal Souls, and the great ac|count that we mu&s;t give of our Steward&s;hip.</P>
<P>And may we have Grace, <HI>that we may be found faithful, that the Ble&s;&s;ings of Souls ready to peri&s;h may come upon us; and when the chief Shepherd &s;hall appear, may we re|ceive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</HI></P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="007407_0055_102B874715768990">
<HI>III.</HI> From what we have heard, we may learn that as good Rulers are a great Ble&s;|&s;ing, we ought to be thankful to GOD for them, di&s;charge the Duties, we owe to them, and &s;uitably improve the Advantages we en|joy under them. Good Rulers are decy|phered in the divine Oracles, by &s;uch &s;igni|ficant Expre&s;&s;ions, as convey a very grand, and &s;ublime Idea, of their great U&s;efulne&s;s. They are called <HI>Lights</HI> to comfort, and di|rect the political Body; <HI>Shields</HI> to protect, and defend it; <HI>Nur&s;ing Fathers</HI> to provide for it; and the very <HI>Breath of our No&s;trils,</HI> to pre&s;erve its Life, and Vigour. And the very Light of Nature, as well as the Word of GOD, makes it evident, that there are cor|re&s;pondent Duties, that Subjects owe to their Rulers. In&s;tead of being <HI>Murmurers and Complainers;</HI> In&s;tead of <HI>reviling the Gods, and &s;peaking evil of the Rulers of our People;</HI> In&s;tead of li&s;tening to the groundle&s;s Sur|mi&s;es, <HI>and evil Reports</HI> of de&s;igning Men; in&s;tead of being fickle, and given to Change, like Weather-cocks, that turn with every Breath of Wind, until they wear them&s;elves out, with their own Motion: (the Bane of popular States!) I &s;ay in&s;tead of the&s;e things, we ought with the mo&s;t unfeigned Gratitude, to pay our Vows <HI>to the Father of Mercies;</HI> for the Provi&s;ion that He has made for our
<PB N="53" REF="007407_0056_102BAE80A869BFB8">
Peace, and Safety, under them <HI>who naturally care for our State.</HI></P>
<P>We ought to Honour our Rulers, <HI>and e&s;teem them very highly in Love, for their Works Sake.</HI> Support them honourably, ac|cording to their Character, that neither their Per&s;ons, nor Office may be de&s;pi&s;ed: Submit to their ju&s;t and legal Authority: Defend their Per&s;ons, and good Names, again&s;t all the A&s;&s;aults of Malice and Envy: And la&s;t|ly fervently pray for them to the <HI>God of all Grace,</HI> that they may be ble&s;&s;ed with all the Ble&s;&s;ings of his Grace, and Goodne&s;s, and that they may be to us, as <HI>the Light of the Morning when the Sun ri&s;eth, even a Morning without Clouds: As the tender Gra&s;s &s;pring|ing out of the Earth by clear Shining after Rain.</HI> And the be&s;t Improvement, we can make of the Advantages we enjoy under them is, <HI>to lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godline&s;s, and Hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>But to conclude; let us all endeavour to do <HI>the Work of the Day, while the Day la&s;ts; and to &s;erve our Generation</HI> in our various Stations, <HI>by the Will of GOD before we fall on Sleep.</HI></P>
<P>GOD has di&s;tingui&s;hed us above any other People, by the innumerable temporal, and &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, and Privileges that we
<PB N="54" REF="007407_0057_102BAE82AF136C10">
enjoy. Our Air is healthful to breathe in, and our Soil is &s;ufficiently Fruitful, to libe|rally reward the diligent Hu&s;bandman, and Supply us with all the Nece&s;&s;aries, and mo&s;t of the Conveniences of Life. Our civil Pri|vileges are &s;o great, as to make us the Envy, (not to &s;ay of our Enemies,) but even of our Neighbours. Our Laws, are very well calculated to &s;ecure our Lives, and Proper|ties, and to reward the good, and puni&s;h the bad. Our Rulers were born, and edu|cated among our &s;elves, and have no foreign Attachments, to counteract the Love of their Country; no Separate Intere&s;ts to draw off their Attention from the good of the public. And indeed, we &s;hall be guilty of inexcu&s;a|ble Ingratitude, if we don't freely acknow|lege, that the Government has be'n &s;erved from Time, to Time, by Men of a public Spirit, and of great Wi&s;dom, and Probity. So that in&s;tead of having the Bramble to rule over us, to &s;cratch and tear us, (as in Jotham's Parable,) we have &s;at under the Shadow, of the &s;preading and fruitful Vine.</P>
<P>Our Mini&s;ters are learned, and orthodox, and have &s;upported their Character, by their evangelical Preaching, and by the Regularity of their Lives; as well (to &s;peak Mode&s;tly) as any &s;uch Number of Men of their Or|der,
<PB N="55" REF="007407_0058_102BAE861A57B2B8">
in any Part of the World. So that our Zion, does not &s;et Solitary, <HI>&s;tretching forth her Hands</HI> and looking until her <HI>Eyes fail,</HI> for &s;ome to relieve her from beyond the Seas; <HI>for her own Sons &s;tand ready to comfort her and take her by the Hand.</HI></P>
<P>Our religious Con&s;titution is very good, if not in all Re&s;pects perfect; and is well fitted to pre&s;erve religious Liberty, Unity, and good Order among&s;t the Mini&s;ters, and Churches of Chri&s;t: And one of the peculiar Excellencies of it is, that Men may differ in Opinion about &s;ome circum&s;tantial things in Religion, and yet be owned as united Bre|thren.</P>
<P>We are watered with <HI>the Rains and Dews</HI> of GOD's Ordinances, admini&s;tred according to their Original In&s;titution; that in them we may <HI>&s;ee CHRIST, as though evidently &s;et forth as Crucified before our Eyes.</HI> And GOD has very often appeared for us, in a very &s;ignal Manner in the Way of his Providence; <HI>and be'n as a Wall of Fire round about us.</HI></P>
<P>Surely we have Rea&s;on to &s;ay, on this Day of <HI>the Gladne&s;s of our Hearts, how precious are thy Thoughts unto us O God! How great is the Sum of them! when we count them over, they are more in Number than the Sand</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="007407_0059_102BAE879E4E06B0">
<HI>which is upon the Sea Shore, and when we awake we are &s;till with thee. The Lines are fallen unto us in plea&s;ant Places, and we have a goodly Heritage!</HI> O how happy &s;hould we be, if we did but know our own Hap|pine&s;s! What can make us unhappy, if we don't make our&s;elves &s;o? And now <HI>what &s;hall we render to God for all his Benefits?</HI> Should not the <HI>Mercies of God</HI> excite us, <HI>to pre&s;ent not only our Bodies, but even our Souls as living &s;acrifices, holy and acceptable unto God?</HI> Can we content our&s;elves with a mere <HI>Form of Godline&s;s, while we deny the Power of it?</HI> Can we &s;atisfy our&s;elves one Moment, without <HI>a good hope thr&ocirc; Grace</HI> that we have laid the Foundation of a reli|gious Life, by a &s;aying Conver&s;ion to GOD, in a way of Humiliation, and Faith in a glo|rious Redeemer? <HI>And can we rejoice in this Hope, unle&s;s we have the Te&s;timony of our own Con&s;cience, that in Simplicity, and godly Sin|cerity, not with fle&s;hly Wi&s;dom; but by the Grace of God, we have our Conver&s;ation in the World?</HI> We may value our&s;elves very much upon our Privileges, and upon our Profe&s;&s;ion; but we &s;hould con&s;ider, that it is a Truth that will remain more firm, and un&s;haken, than the Pillars of Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, or the Foundation of the Earth, <HI>that without Holi|ne&s;s, no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="007407_0060_102BAE89A0D0E100">
We ought to be greatly concerned about the Sins of others, and even <HI>mourn in Se|cret Places,</HI> that there are &s;o many Land-defiling Sins, that break in upon us, like a Flood: And as <HI>GOD's Hand is now lifted up,</HI> and he is &s;howing us <HI>the Rod of his Anger, our Fle&s;h might well tremble for fear of GOD,</HI> and we might be <HI>afraid of his Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>But however GOD may deal with us as a People, or as a Community, it infinitely con|cerns every one of us in particular, <HI>to know the Plague of our own Hearts</HI> and to mourn over our own pa&s;t Sins; and <HI>to fly for Re|fuge, to lay hold on the Hope &s;et before us.</HI> We are all ha&s;tening to that Place, <HI>from whence we &s;hall never return,</HI> and we have &s;omething to do, of greater Importance, than to blow Feathers about in the Air. We may live in Je&s;t, but we mu&s;t die in earne&s;t; and there is no trifling in Heaven, or Hell. There is an awful Seriou&s;ne&s;s, that may be ob&s;erved in all the Parts of the vi&s;ible Cre|ation. Every thing (Man excepted,) tends to promote the great End for which it was made; and all things with one united Voice, call upon us to be &s;erious, and <HI>work out our own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</HI> Thr&ocirc; the infinite Patience, and Long-&s;uffer|ing of GOD, we have yet <HI>an accepted Time,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="007407_0061_102BAE8BB90F3D20">
<HI>and a Day of Salvation,</HI> let it therefore <HI>&s;uffice us,</HI> that we have &s;pent &s;o much of our Time, either in the vain Amu&s;ements, or criminal Indulgences of a &s;en&s;ual Life, and let us endeavour <HI>to pre&s;s forward, towards the Mark for the Prize, of the high Calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: That we may finally receive the End of our Faith, the Salvation of our Souls.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling; and to pre&s;ent you faultle&s;s, before the pre&s;ence of his Glory, with exceeding Joy; to the only wi&s;e God our Saviour, be Glory, and Maje&s;ty, Dominion and Power; both now, and ever,</HI></P>
