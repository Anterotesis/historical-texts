<Q>For thou ha&s;t made him a little lower than the angels.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>PHILOSOPHERS, for the purpo&s;e of rea&s;on|ing and communicating their ideas to better advantage, have divided all exi&s;tences into cla&s;&s;es. The&s;e divi&s;ions are denominated by &s;uch general terms, as a genus, &s;pecies, order, and rank of beings. Matter is a general term, including all the ideas, which belong, in common, to all material exi&s;tences. They then &s;ubdivide material exi&s;tence into &s;everal &s;pecies. Inanimate exi&s;tence con&s;titutes one, vegetable another, and animals a third &s;pecies, ri&s;ing, by way of gradation, from the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t in kind. Spirit is al&s;o a general common name of all &s;piritual beings, which, however, are divided into different cla&s;&s;es, as
<PB N="4" REF="028378_0004_0FD8DCD4E424DE60">
divine, angelic, and human. The &s;oul is a &s;piritual exi&s;tence; men, therefore, form one, and the angels another and higher rank. Whatever the &s;pecific difference between an|gels and men may be, the text places us as but little below them, and at the head of all other creatures in this world. Man is made, (for he is the per&s;on meant in the text,) a <HI>little lower</HI> than the angels. Indeed, the a|nalogy ob&s;ervable in all the works of God, together with the text, afford us rea&s;ons to believe, that the angels ri&s;e in different ranks one above another, till at la&s;t the Almighty appears infinitely above the whole, as the &s;uperior head of all principality and power, or of all ranks in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>ALL beings rank according to their real dignity and worth. Different orders of crea|tures ought, therefore, to ri&s;e, by ea&s;y gra|dations, men above animals, and angels above men, in proportion to their different degrees of real dignity and value. By the &s;ame rule, all the &s;tates and kingdoms of the earth ought to rank them&s;elves. And all beings ought to employ all their powers agreeably to, and uniformly in, the &s;tations a&s;&s;igned them, by the Author of their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>ASCERTAINING clearly the real value of things in general, and of tho&s;e properties in particular which are the mo&s;t valuable, will teach men their real worth, and the rank they &s;u&s;tain, and prepare the way to &s;how how the
<PB N="5" REF="028378_0005_0FD8DCD5E3BD3F08">
improvement of the mind will contribute to the good of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>LET it then be &s;hewn,</P>
<P>I. WHAT con&s;titutes the real worth of be|ings in general.</P>
<P>THE value of all things is either <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> or <HI>relative.</HI> The rea&s;on why any thing is e&s;teemed, is, on account of the immediate plea&s;ure which it affords, and the happine&s;s it may hereafter produce. As all happine&s;s pre&s;uppo&s;es a plea&s;ing object, tho&s;e which &s;uit the reli&s;h of the mind may be termed the <HI>&s;ources</HI> of happine&s;s. Tho&s;e things then, which, of them&s;elves, afford immediate plea|&s;ure, have intrin&s;ic value; but tho&s;e things which plea&s;e only when viewed as nece&s;&s;ary means to happine&s;s hereafter, have a relative value. Hence, &s;ome kinds of fruit are valued on account of the immediate plea&s;ure which they afford, and al&s;o, for the &s;ake of &s;ome future good to which they are a nece&s;&s;ary mean, by re&s;toring health, nouri&s;hing the bo|dy, and procuring other things of higher gra|tification. There are &s;ome things, which, in them&s;elves, afford no &s;atisfaction; the&s;e are valued only as means to happine&s;s hereafter. It is in this relative view that money is &s;o highly e&s;teemed; becau&s;e it &s;erves as a mean to procure mo&s;t of the &s;ources of happine&s;s in the pre&s;ent life. Hence, &s;ome things have
<PB N="6" REF="028378_0006_0FD8DCD7453413B8">
only a relative, and others have both a rela|tive and an intrin&s;ic value.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, although &s;ome things give immediate gratification, yet, if they will hereafter de&s;troy our happin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> on the whole valuable. Hence, tho&s;e things only will be e&s;teemed by any per&s;on on the whole as valuable, which give him more plea&s;ure than pain. And tho&s;e things only which on the whole produce more good than evil, ought to be e&s;teemed by us as being really valuable to &s;ociety. And by the &s;ame rule, in e&s;timating the worth of things, we ought not to con&s;ider any thing as valuable on the whole, only that which will finally and forever i&s;&s;ue in the highe&s;t happine&s;s of the univer&s;e. As all per&s;ons ought to &s;eek the good of &s;ociety, &s;o all &s;ocieties ought to &s;eek the good of the univer&s;e: And as the good of each of the&s;e is in&s;eparably connected, every per&s;on by &s;eeking the highe&s;t good of the one, promotes the highe&s;t good of the other. Hence, the highe&s;t good or happine&s;s of the moral &s;y&s;tem, is the <HI>&s;tandard</HI> by which we are to e&s;timate the worth of every thing. According to this &s;tandard, the following are the only rea&s;ons why any exi&s;tences, with their pro|perties, are valuable. (1.) Becau&s;e &s;ome of them are capable of enjoying the highe&s;t good. A capacity to enjoy good is valuable on this very account. Ve&s;&s;els in daily u&s;e, are e&s;teemed on account of what they receive
<PB N="7" REF="028378_0007_0FD8DCDBF8240E18">
and contain. In this view, the worth of any being is great, in proportion to the &s;um of happine&s;s he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> capable of enjoying during his exi&s;tence. (2.) Becau&s;e they are a means of the increa&s;e and diffu&s;ion of happine&s;s. An exi&s;tence is valuable, if it is a means of pro|moting, although it is not capable of enjoying happine&s;s. In this view, the intrin&s;ic and re|lative value of all things is greater or le&s;s, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> they promote the highe&s;t good of the moral &s;y&s;tem. Hence, tho&s;e things which &s;erve as means to happine&s;s, without any capacity to enjoy it, have not that degree of worth tho&s;e beings have who are capable both of enjoying and increa&s;ing it.</P>
<P>THIS leads me to inquire,</P>
<P>II. WHAT tho&s;e faculties or properties in any being are in particular, which are the mo&s;t valuable?</P>
<P>THE &s;oul of man is a ray from the Eternal Source of intelligence; and, like its author, is compo&s;ed of three general faculties, <HI>under|&s;tanding, ta&s;te,</HI> and <HI>will.</HI></P>
<P>THE under&s;tanding is the receptacle of ideas; that faculty which perceives truth and fal&s;ehood, right and wrong, and is the &s;eat of every rational proce&s;s and operation. It is the light of the &s;oul, the candle of the Lord &s;hining in every man, to direct him in the way to true happine&s;s and glory. It is nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="8" REF="028378_0008_0FD8DCDD16307B20">
to the exi&s;tence of happine&s;s, and capable of endle&s;s growth and improvement in know|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">edge.</P>
<P>THE faculty of ta&s;te is the &s;eat of all our plea&s;ures and pains. If man were de&s;titute of this, or of feeling, he would no more be the &s;ubject of happine&s;s, or of mi&s;ery, than the inanimate creation.&mdash;This is one proper|ty of our nature, by which we are di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from, and exalted above, the lower orders of exi&s;tence. This faculty is, al&s;o, capable of improvement in refinement, in delicacy, and &s;en&s;ibility; and hereby of deriving more &s;atis|faction from all the &s;ources of happine&s;s a|round us. Of the&s;e &s;ources, &s;ome are &s;hort in their duration, and others are eternal. If the reli&s;h of the mind is &s;uch as to be plea&s;ed with the former only, we are not prepared for end|le&s;s happine&s;s; becau&s;e, in this ca&s;e, our pre|&s;ent happine&s;s will terminate when the&s;e tem|poral, and fading &s;ources have an end. And tho&s;e &s;ources which will continue, and afford delight to a good ta&s;te, will be &s;ources of mi|&s;ery to a bad one. Hence, according to the nature of our ta&s;te, we are prepared to experi|ence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> happine&s;s&punc; or mi&s;ery, forever. This &s;hows how important it is, that the ta&s;te &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rectified and improved; and &s;hows, that its eternal grow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> lays a foundation for endle&s;s increa&s;ing happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE will is the next faculty, which exalts men above the interior ranks. Volition and
<PB N="9" REF="028378_0009_0FD8DCE416C53558">
its connection with effects con&s;titute all that power, or regency, of which intelligent beings are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.&mdash;We know, that to obtain the objects, and an&s;wer the end, which &s;uit the ta&s;te, many mediate effects, as means, are of|ten nece&s;&s;ary. The&s;e are produced by volun|tary exertions. Hence, without the faculty of will, men would be de&s;titute of power, and be unable to obtain any end, or accompli&s;h any &s;cheme what&s;oever. Without this, he would not be a moral agent, or accountable for any of his actions. This faculty, therefore, is nece&s;&s;ary in union with the others, to form a complete man; and has been the cau&s;e of all the great works and actions, which have been performed by men on the theatre of life.</P>
<P>THESE faculties united con&s;titute a &s;oul, which is a complete, natural image of the great Creator. The&s;e are the faculties, or properties, in particular, which are of the greate&s;t value; and render man a being of higher rank, than any other being in this world; and capable of endle&s;s growth in knowledge, in goodne&s;s, and happine&s;s. Be|cau&s;e the&s;e render him capable of more &s;ub|lime enjoyments, and of promoting the high|e&s;t good, to a greater degree than any other rank of exi&s;tence, below the angelic.</P>
<P>LET us now take a view of the beings which &s;urround us, and a&s;certain their rank in the gradations of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="028378_0010_0FD8DCE865F8A078">
MERE matter, being devoid of all tho&s;e properties, which are nece&s;&s;ary to enjoyment, has no value, only as a mean to promote it. In this relation, it is of great &s;ervice, and con|tributes much to the felicity of intelligent be|ings. But as it is not capable of any enjoy|ment, it takes the lowe&s;t place in the grade of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>ANIMAL beings are &s;en&s;itive, capable &s;ub|jects of plea&s;ure and pain, are al&s;o a mean of more good to &s;ociety, and, therefore, po&s;&s;e&s;s properties of higher value than mere matter. In the&s;e re&s;pects, being of greater dignity and worth, they occupy the next rank in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>NEXT in the a&s;cent is man, who is capable, not only of the enjoyment, and increa&s;e of more happine&s;s in this life, than any other or|der of beings; but he is de&s;igned to be the &s;ub|ject, and the mean of increa&s;ing happine&s;s and glory through an endle&s;s duration. He, there|fore, &s;u&s;tains the highe&s;t rank in this world, and is &s;tationed but a little below the angelic or|ders; and, on account of his &s;uperior dignity, is made lord of this lower creation. Indeed, the &s;acred pages, and the analogy of the di|vine works, afford as rea&s;ons to believe, that the di&s;tance between man and the lowe&s;t order of angels, is nearly the &s;ame as the di&s;tance between man and the animal tribes. And the &s;ame rea&s;ons may convince us, that the angels
<PB N="11" REF="028378_0011_0FD8DCEA9915E7D0">
ri&s;e in ranks above each other, towards the throne of the Almighty. Hence, we read of the cherubims, the &s;eraphims, of principali|ties, dominions, and powers, which terms de|note the different ranks in the angelic world.</P>
<P>HAVING a&s;cended, in taking a view of the ri&s;ing ranks of exi&s;tence, to God the &s;upreme head, and king of the univer&s;e, let us &s;top, for a moment, and contemplate his infinite digni|ty and glory. He, not only enjoys an inex|hau&s;tible fountain of happine&s;s in him&s;elf, but is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the attributes nece&s;&s;ary to communicate and diffu&s;e it to the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;i|ble extent. God is the original fountain of all that is good, and of all that is valuable through|out the creation. It is on account of his infi|nite dignity and worth, that he does, and ought alone, to &s;u&s;tain the highe&s;t rank in the univer&s;e. All other ranks are derived from, and dependent on him. His will gave them exi&s;tence; according to it they are governed, and will be di&s;po&s;ed of for ever. In what ex|act order God has arranged his creatures, from the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t. The lower ranks are &s;ubordinated to the higher; they are mutu|ally dependent on, and &s;ub&s;ervient to the good of each other, and the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the moral &s;y&s;tem. All his works, through every rank, &s;peak his exi&s;tence, his univer&s;al pre|&s;ence, and agency, and, like a mirror, reflect to the view of rational creatures, his infinite glory. We are ranked &s;o very far beneath Je|hovah,
<PB N="12" REF="028378_0012_0FD8DCEF8966F798">
that when he looks down, through the angelic orders, on men, it is no matter of won|der to hear him &s;ay, the nations are as the drop of the bucket, and accounted as the &s;mall du&s;t of the balance&mdash;all nations are, before him, as nothing, and le&s;s than nothing and va|nity. Lord what is man, that thou art mind|ful of him? And are not we under every obli|gation to look up to God, and unite with the &s;hining ranks around his throne, in their ado|ring pro&s;tration at his foot-&s;tool; and, with the highe&s;t joy, join in their con&s;tant anthem of prai&s;e, that the Lord God Omnipotent reign|eth?</P>
<P>ALL creatures ri&s;e by nice gradations from the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t, and hereby di&s;play the wi&s;dom of God. Hence, among the in|dividuals of the &s;ame rank, &s;ome have le&s;s, and others greater value; &s;o that the differ|ence here is as great, as the difference between the greate&s;t in one, and the lea&s;t individual in another, through all the &s;everal ranks of created exi&s;tence. Hence no &s;cha&s;ms appear, for every &s;pace is occupied by &s;ome creature of le&s;s or greater dignity and worth; and the individuals of every kind, and the &s;everal ranks, being linked together, form one &s;tu|penduous whole, which will i&s;&s;ue, finally, in the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible increa&s;e and diffu&s;ion of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>ALL that now remains, is, to apply the &s;ubject,</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="028378_0013_0FD8DCF166EE2FC0">
BY &s;howing how the improvement of the mind will contribute to the good of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>WE have taken into view the natural capa|cities of that &s;piritual exi&s;tence, called the &s;oul of man. The&s;e faculties improve with our growth in knowledge, goodne&s;s, and happi|ne&s;s; and they have no value, except as they &s;tand related to &s;uch improvement. In this view, their value is equal to the importance of knowledge of virtue, of the dignity and happine&s;s of &s;ociety. The inanimate creation has no capacity for improvement in know|ledge, in virtue, or in happine&s;s; and the highe&s;t improvement of which animals are capable, is very limited. But man is made to grow and increa&s;e for ever: And his happi|ne&s;s will increa&s;e, e&s;pecially hereafter, in pro|portion to his growth in knowledge and vir|tue. Without improving in the&s;e re&s;pects, the rank and dig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">y of man will be &s;tation|ary. But by &s;uch improvements he may exalt his rank, ri&s;e in dignity and glory, until he exceeds in lu&s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the brightne&s;s of the &s;un.</P>
<P>To make it appear then, di&s;tinctly, what means are nece&s;&s;ary to the improvement of the mind, and how &s;uch improvement will contribute to the good of &s;ociety, let it be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>That every civil community, whether &s;tate, kingdom, or empire, may be con&s;idered a political per&s;on. The legi&s;lative or &s;upreme
<PB N="14" REF="028378_0014_0FD8DCF2DBC763A0">
authority is the head or &s;oul of this per&s;on; and the &s;everal individuals, compo&s;ing the community, are the members. The&s;e mem|bers, with their head, con&s;titute one entire political per&s;on. The legi&s;lative authority is the collective voice and will of the &s;ociety. And as the greate&s;t wi&s;dom in the community ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the head, for this rea&s;on it ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to each per&s;on his duty, and direct and govern, as far as is nece&s;&s;ary, to the highe&s;t good of the whole body. In this view it is evident, that as every civil commu|nity is compo&s;ed of a united collection of in|dividuals, its real dignity and worth are in proportion to the dignity and worth of the per&s;ons compo&s;ing it. But as per&s;ons increa&s;e in real value and dignity only by improving their minds, by &s;uch improvement only can the true dignity and glory of any &s;ociety be increa&s;ed. Therefore, whatever is nece&s;&s;ary to their improvement, is nece&s;&s;ary to the highe&s;t good and improvement of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>FOR further illu&s;tration, let it be enquired. Is not a &s;ociety pro&s;perous and happy, in pro|portion as the members enjoy their rights, li|berties, and privileges in peace, and &s;afety? When they are neither di&s;turbed by internal broils, nor foreign wars, nor &s;tand in fear of them? When the members, from a &s;pirit of love, mutually di&s;charge all the offices of kind|ne&s;s and friend&s;hip, and enjoy every nece&s;&s;ary &s;ource of happine&s;s? But, how &s;hall &s;ociety be advanced to a &s;tate &s;o de&s;irable; and what
<PB N="15" REF="028378_0015_0FD8DCF3E2D8AF50">
means are requi&s;ite to accompli&s;h an end &s;o important? What, but knowledge, can devi&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary means? And what, but a virtu|ous di&s;po&s;ition, will prompt a per&s;on to &s;eek, invariably, the good of &s;ociety? And what, but power, or voluntary exertions, can accom|pli&s;h the patriotic wi&s;hes of virtue? Surely, &s;uch attributes are nece&s;&s;ary to the highe&s;t good of &s;ociety. Otherwi&s;e, why do all men judge, that the rulers of a nation ought to be men eminent for knowledge, and virtue? And that power, in every community, is nece&s;&s;ary to its happy exi&s;tence? The&s;e are con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;ary to qualify a per&s;on to govern well. By being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of knowledge, power, and goodne&s;s in perfection, Deity is qualified to govern the univer&s;e with unerring rectitude. And, in proportion as the members of any civil body excel in the&s;e improvements, they approach towards perfection, and are qualified to advance the happine&s;s and glory of &s;ociety. And, it is evident, that a deg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> of that, which is nece&s;&s;ary to make a good ruler, is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a good &s;ubject. How happy, were every one fit to govern. Then, whether he &s;u&s;tains a private or public character, he would, invariably, &s;eek by the be&s;t adapted means, the highe&s;t good of &s;ociety. And, were all the members, thus qualified, it would be impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;ociety, with the common ble&s;&s;ings of providence, &s;hould not, al&s;o, enjoy the highe&s;t dignity and pro&s;perity,</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e remarks, it is obvious, that the
<PB N="16" REF="028378_0016_0FD8DCF81E924758">
improvement of the mind is not only requi&s;ite, but highly &s;o, to the advancement of &s;ociety to any higher perfection than that already at|tained. Hence, as it is the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of politicians to promote the happine&s;s of civil community, the improvement of the mind is one mean, without which, they can never ful|ly reach their end.

It was owing, in a great mea&s;ure, to their &s;uperior knowledge, that the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, &s;o far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in dig|nity and &s;plendor, all the barbarous nations a|round them. And how did Europe emerge from darkne&s;s, and &s;hine with &s;uperior lu&s;tre, by the revival of letters, in the &s;ixteenth cen|tury? And the States of America owe their &s;uperiority, in point of dignity, above the &s;a|vage tribes, to the cultivation of their minds in the arts and &s;ciences. Indeed, the fame of every nation is to be attributed more to a few men of eminent knowledge, than to all their kings and mighty conquerors.&mdash;Knowledge has made a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;tinctions between man and man, and between nations and nations.

Tho&s;e con&s;titutions, which &s;e|cure the rights and liberties of men; tho&s;e laws which govern &s;ociety, owe their origin to men of knowledge. Men, by the improve|ment of the mind, have made di&s;coveries in the heavens and in the earth, and in all the
<PB N="18" REF="028378_0018_0FD8DCF99EAF25F8">
works of God, which have illuminated the world, and taught us how we may convert the furniture of nature, to the u&s;e and benefit of &s;ociety. The nece&s;&s;ity and utility of know|ledge, to the happine&s;s of the world, are in|conceivably great. And virtue, by which I mean true religion, is not le&s;s important. This has its &s;eat in the ta&s;te, or heart of men. She is a con&s;tant friend to man&mdash;to his rights, to his liberties, and to his everla&s;ting felicity. She is the brighte&s;t ornament, the mo&s;t precious jewel, and mo&s;t valuable crown of glory to man. Knowledge, when united with a vicious, in&s;tead of a virtuous di&s;po&s;ition, has been a means of more hurt than good, in every age of the world. It is owing to Satan's &s;uperior knowledge, as one cau&s;e, that he has been able to found a king|dom in this world, and maintain his dominion over the &s;ons of men. His knowledge con|certed the mea&s;ures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his vile heart car|ried into execution, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> our fir&s;t pa|rents, and e&s;tabli&s;hing the reign of &s;in through the earth. If Alexander had been ignorant of the military art, and of the means nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e and equip an army, he could not have accompli&s;hed his ambitious views in conquer|ing the world. Ignorance re&s;trains and limits the operations of vice. But, knowledge o|pens to view a field for the depraved heart, like a violent &s;torm, to &s;pread de&s;truction far and near. Of this we have many in&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE Cae&s;ars, by their arts and intrigues,
<PB N="19" REF="028378_0019_0FD8DD0135864D10">
deprived Rome of her liberties, and reduced her to &s;lavery. What may not be expected from an increa&s;e of light without virtue? Re|volutions in favour of the rights of man may &s;ucceed, and the tree of liberty may be plant|ed in various &s;oils; yet the &s;ame light which di&s;covers the way to demoli&s;h the thrones of de&s;poti&s;m, and humble the proud tyrants of the earth, may enable the ambitious to de|&s;troy the temple of liberty, and erect in its &s;tead the throne of tyranny. Where are the liberties of Sparta, of Athens, of Greece, and of Rome? If virtue had held an equal domi|nion with the light which illuminated Greece and Rome, the tree of liberty might have flouri&s;hed in tho&s;e countries to the pre&s;ent day. And, if the light of the pre&s;ent day &s;hould enable the ambitious to de&s;troy the li|berties of America, &s;uch an event would be no more extraordinary, than tho&s;e of a &s;imi|lar nature which have been effected in the world. The influences of the &s;un, however &s;alutary in common, if rain be with-held, on|ly &s;erve to harden the earth, and de&s;troy the &s;ources of life and happine&s;s. Light, without virtue, produces &s;imilar effects in the moral world. Hence, without religion, the human race cannot reach a more exalted rank; but, by a retrograde motion, will &s;ink lower into di&s;grace and mi&s;ery. Angels, &s;tripped of the robe of virtue, became devils, and fell from the highe&s;t &s;eats above, into the lowe&s;t pit of darkne&s;s and &s;hame. Where &s;hall we find any

By this, man, &s;imple as he is at pre&s;ent, may ri&s;e to the highe&s;t glory in heaven. This is the ornament which adorns and dignifies human nature. It is the genius, the &s;pirit, and the life of liberty. Unle&s;s we improve in virtue, our improvements in knowledge &s;erve only to &s;ink us more &s;wiftly and deeply into endle&s;s &s;hame and darkne&s;s. As ignorance and vice will degrade per&s;ons and nations, to a level with the mo&s;t uncivilized and &s;avage tribes in Africa; &s;o when they are enlightened with the beams of &s;cience and virtue, they ri&s;e in|to re&s;pectability. As there is nothing to pre|vent their growing in greatne&s;s, &s;ince the field of knowledge is infinitely extended, they may proceed in a con&s;tant progre&s;&s;ion for ever. By improvement, lower ranks may a&s;cend, till they reach an inconceivable height. By pur&s;uing this path, we have rea&s;on to believe, from the pen of prophecy, that future nations will &s;hine more bright than the luminary of heaven. For we read of a time, when all &s;hall know the Lord from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t; and when the light of one day, &s;hall

be as the light of &s;even. The&s;e remarks are &s;ufficient to convince every per&s;on, how high|ly important the improvement of the mind is to the dignity and happine&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BUT how &s;hall the mind be thus improved? To this end, <HI>education,</HI> on one hand, and the <HI>attention</HI> and <HI>application</HI> of the mind, on the other, are requi&s;ite. The mind, like &s;eed &s;own in a garden, needs cultivation to favour its growth. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of education, to bring into view tho&s;e things which ought to be known; and to give it a right direction in the pur&s;uit of knowledge; and by a proper application of the mind to acquire it, it will daily enlarge its views&mdash;di&s;cover the nature and properties of the things by which it is &s;urrounded&mdash;their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and dependen|cies&mdash;their various u&s;es and de&s;igns, and their ultimate relation to the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the univer&s;e. The under&s;tanding, by &s;uch cultivation and u&s;e, acquires greater penetra|tion and readine&s;s, to di&s;cover the agreement and di&s;agreement of things, with their con|nections, relations, and de&s;igns. It acquires an habit of inve&s;tigating with ea&s;e, indepen|dence, and vigour; and every progre&s;&s;ive &s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> facilitates future advances in the field of know|ledge, and renders the walks of &s;cience the more agreeable.

lo&s;t in &s;earch of new di&s;coveries, which may promote the happine&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BUT, with what branches of knowledge ought the mind to be more e&s;pecially ac|quainted? Man, in one age, cannot learn eve|ry thing. For this rea&s;on, we ought to ac|quaint our&s;elves, more e&s;pecially, with tho&s;e branches of &s;cience, which have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he greate&s;t tendency to rectify the ta&s;te&mdash;to promote the good of &s;ociety, and our own eternal felicity. But, of all the &s;ciences, <HI>politics</HI> and <HI>divinity</HI> will have the greate&s;t influence in an&s;wering the&s;e important purpo&s;es. The great de&s;ign of politics, (by which I mean the whole &s;y&s;|tem of civil juri&s;prudence) is to concert and pur&s;ue tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which will advance the highe&s;t good of &s;ociety. The whole &s;y&s;tem of divinity has the &s;ame object in view, and, fur|ther, aims at the future ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of man|kind.&mdash;It is true, &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e &s;ci|ences have no relation, or connection with each other. Such a &s;uppo&s;ition is attended with many ruinous effects. The fact, is, they are branches of moral philo&s;ophy; founded on the &s;ame general principles; aim at the &s;ame object, and differ, only, in certain cir|cum&s;tances. This will be evident from the following illu&s;trations.</P>
<P>ALL intelligent beings form one great com|munity, or kingdom, of which God is the &s;upreme head. The greate&s;t happine&s;s of his
<PB N="23" REF="028378_0023_0FD8DD0AD8AB7DA0">
kingdom, is the ultimate object which all his &s;ubjects ought to be plea&s;ed with, and invari|ably &s;eek. Here is the origin of all moral ob|ligation; for it is the highe&s;t good which binds and obligates moral agents. All the &s;tates, kingdoms, and empires of this world, may be viewed as &s;o many colonies, into which this univer&s;al kingdom of Jehovah is divided. Let us view the&s;e colonies as &s;o many di&s;tinct political per&s;ons; then we can as ea&s;ily &s;ee the general principles which ought to govern them, as we can &s;ee the general principles by which individual per&s;ons ought to be govern|ed; for they &s;tand in the &s;ame relation indivi|dual per&s;ons do to each other, and the univer&s;e. Now, it is &s;elf evident, that individual per&s;ons ought to &s;eek each others happine&s;s, to the extent of their abilities, and the highe&s;t good of tho&s;e bodies, of whatever denomination, to which they belong. To do this is right, and to do otherwi&s;e is wrong. Here, then, are two general principles, or laws, which nece&s;&s;a|rily involve each other; one of which binds us to &s;eek the highe&s;t good of all individuals, and the other the good of all collective bodies. Al&s;o, when any per&s;on acts the part of an ene|my to another, or to any collective body, and it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to the good of the whole, that his good &s;hould be relinqui&s;hed, and he be made the &s;ubject of puni&s;hment:&mdash;the principle ju&s;t &s;tated, which requires us to &s;eek the high<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> good obligates us to relinqui&s;h his good&punc; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> puni&s;hment upon him.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="028378_0024_0FD8DD0C61819F18">
THESE and the like are general principles, or the laws of nature, which all beings are &s;everally bound to ob&s;erve; upon which the law of God, civil laws, and the laws of na|tions are founded. The great de&s;ign of the&s;e laws, with the rewards annexed to them, is, to enforce obedience to the law of nature: For it is by ob&s;erving the laws of nature, that the good of individuals, and the general good, are &s;ecured and promoted. Every act, which is injurious on the whole to happine&s;s in gene|ral, is a breach of the law of nature; and every act which aims at happine&s;s in general, is an act of obedience to it. Hence, the&s;e ge|neral principles are very exten&s;ive: For they prohibit or require all tho&s;e acts of every kind, which ought to be prohibited or required by any of the laws either of God or of men. On the&s;e principles, the whole &s;y&s;tems of politics and of divinity are founded. Their object is, likewi&s;e, the &s;ame: For they, unitedly, aim at general happine&s;s. Hence, tho&s;e greatly err, who view politics and divinity as wholly di&s;connected. Hence, the&s;e &s;ciences not only contain the principles, but al&s;o all the duties which are nece&s;&s;ary to our per&s;onal good, to the good of civil &s;ociety, and to the highe&s;t good of the moral &s;y&s;tem. Therefore, of all branches of knowledge, none are of equal im|portance to be taught and well under&s;tood by the human race. The&s;e pre&s;ent to view an unbounded field for mental improvement. Here is room for the mind to expand, and
<PB N="25" REF="028378_0025_0FD8DD0E1BBA3C70">
enlarge her acquaintance with the principles and duties which are the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> conducive to the happine&s;s of the world. Here is room for the everla&s;ting improvement and gratification of a good reli&s;h of heart. Here is pre&s;ented to our view, the &s;tronge&s;t motives to per&s;uade us to make every po&s;&s;ible exertion nece&s;&s;ary to the good of &s;ociety, the glory of God, and increa&s;ing good of his kingdom. Hence, it appears, that God has di&s;played his wi&s;dom and benevolence, in appointing an order of men, to teach us publicly, and weekly, tho&s;e principles and duties which are adapted to improve the mind, better the heart, regulate the conduct, and diffu&s;e light and happine&s;s through every order of men. And, as politics and divinity are built on the &s;ame original principles, include the &s;ame duties, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at the &s;ame object, in teaching one, the other is taught, in a greater or le&s;s degree. This mode of weekly education, in&s;tituted by God, is the be&s;t adapted to improve the minds and hearts of men, of any now in practice; and has more influence in regulating their lives and promoting the good of &s;ociety, than any other mea&s;ures which have been adopted by the wi&s;e&s;t politicians of the earth. And the de&s;ign of this benevolent in&s;titution is more perfectly an&s;wered, in proportion as the mi|ni&s;try is filled with men of abilities, piety, and learning. Tho&s;e, therefore, who neglect this in&s;titution, would do well to enquire, whether they act a friendly part towards the
<PB N="26" REF="028378_0026_0FD8DD0F7A934CE0">
improvement of the mind, the good of &s;ociety, or them&s;elves, or &s;how any &s;uitable reverence to the Almighty? And tho&s;e, who deny the divinity of the &s;criptures, would do well to in|quire &s;oberly, whether they are not &s;apping the foundation of politics and &s;ociety, and acting incon&s;i&s;tent with their political creed?</P>
<P>ON the whole, is the improvement of the mind, an object of &s;uch importance to increa&s;e the glory and dignity of man, and the dignity and happine&s;s of &s;ociety? Ought this to claim the attention of rulers, as the &s;ure&s;t way to an&s;wer the important de&s;igns of government?</P>
<P>THEN we learn the importance of having every public &s;tation filled with men the mo&s;t eminent for virtue and wi&s;dom. Good abili|ties, exten&s;ive knowledge and virtue, con&s;ti|tute true worth and merit. Tho&s;e who have more merit in the&s;e re&s;pects than others, are exalted in rank above them. They have ri&s;en by merit. And, as public &s;tations are places of eminence, men of the greate&s;t worth ought to fill them. They will fill them with digni|ty, utility, and honour. They will feel, more than others, the importance of having the mind improved in every u&s;eful qualification: they will attend to it, as the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure to promote the general good. When they are called by the &s;uffrages of the free|men from their private walks, to fill &s;uch &s;eats <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> eminence, their regard for the public weal

is the great motive which will induce them to obey, and engage in the arduous work a&s;|&s;igned them. Such men never &s;eek any pub|lic &s;tation by intrigue. Every method of ex|alting them&s;elves, except by merit, to places of eminence, is beneath their notice. They de&s;pi&s;e all the low arts of intrigue, as mean and de&s;picable.

As men compo&s;e one entire rank, they are by creation equal; one no greater than another, and each entitled to all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ights and prerogatives of men. They ought, therefore, to feel towards each other as brethren, and view each other as fellow-&s;overeigns of the world&mdash;as the &s;ubjects of the Almighty&mdash;and as made to advance the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the univer&s;e. Among all the orders of being in this world, as far as our knowledge extends, man alone is made capable of endle&s;s growth and improvement.&mdash;And his improvemement depends on his conduct&mdash;on the u&s;e of his a|bilities&mdash;and the means and advantages with which he is highly privileged and di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by his all-bountiful Creator. According to our conduct, we &s;hall grow in dignity and worth, and &s;hine with increa&s;ing lu&s;tre; or &s;ink into greater and greater &s;hame, darkne&s;s, and mi&s;ery for ever.&mdash;Sin &s;tains the glory&punc; darkens the lu&s;tre and degrades the rank of every intelligent creature. While virtue or religion, connected with knowledge, is the brighte&s;t crown of glory, which dignifies us more and more, till we &s;hall, through divine

grace, be fixed as &s;tars in the firmament a|bove, to &s;hine with increa&s;ing everla&s;ting brightne&s;s. Science, and the religion which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> us in the volumes of creation, of providence, and revelation, are the eternal friends and &s;upporters of liberty; friends and &s;ervants to the growing greatne&s;s, and endle&s;s happine&s;s of man. While ignorance and vice degrade our rank, en&s;lave the mind, and con|&s;titute the foundation of every &s;y&s;tem of tyran|ny. How many examples might be produced in &s;upport of the pre&s;ent &s;entiment. Witne&s;s the fall of angels. Look through the world, at A&s;ia, at Africa, at a great part of Europe and America, where vice, and in many king|doms profound ignorance, have reigned tri|umphant; and what do we behold, but a world of &s;laves, and the uncontrouled &s;way of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, look at the&s;e United States enjoying their rights and liberties, founded at fir&s;t by men too eminently reli|gious to remain any longer in a land of &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion. Liberty, exiled from Europe, cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic with them, and fixed her &s;tandard in this we&s;tern world. This &s;hows, that religion is the genius, the life, and &s;pirit of liberty, and the foundation of all true hap|pine&s;s and greatne&s;s. By her aid, from &s;mall beginnings, we have ri&s;en into a growing em|pire. If we continue to cultivate &s;cience and virtue, our land may become a paradi&s;e, and
<PB N="33" REF="028378_0033_0FD8DD20B2186AC8">
our nation, in &s;ome way, be in&s;trumental in erecting the temple of liberty on the ruins of every throne of tyranny through the world. But if vice &s;hould univer&s;ally prevail, and re|ligion be exiled, however the light of &s;cience may increa&s;e, liberty will follow religion; and if they find no place to erect their &s;tand|ard in this world, they will leave it to groan under the &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ions of vice, and revi&s;it their native &s;kies.</P>
<P>Now then, the broad road which leads to &s;lavery&mdash;to &s;hame, and mi&s;ery, is before us; and the narrow way, which leads to greater freedom, to brighter &s;cenes, to increa&s;ing greatne&s;s, and future glories, is clearly pre|&s;ented to our view. Let us ri&s;e, then, and by cul|tivating &s;cience, di&s;pel the clouds of ignorance and darkne&s;s, and, by virtuous lives, bani&s;h all vice from among us&mdash;Let us ri&s;e &s;uperior to the empty grandeurs and fading glories of this world, and pur&s;ue our journey after higher ranks before us, by &s;wift advances in the im|provement of the mind in knowledge, in virtue, and happine&s;s, for ever. Amen.</P>
