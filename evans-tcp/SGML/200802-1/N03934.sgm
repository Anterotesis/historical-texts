<P>W<HI>Edne&s;day, June</HI> 25. Went on Monday, and returned this Evening from <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> which I have &s;een with no &s;mall Satisfacti|on.

Good. In a few Years the <HI>Saltzburghers</HI> I believe will be a flouri&s;hing People. Their Land is tolle|rable good, and lies very near the River. They already provide Food, and e're long will be capable of providing Raiment for them&s;elves. I &s;hall &s;end 'em up Cotton, and Spinning-Wheels, and a Loom to begin a Manufactory; and next Year I hope their own Land will produce enough Flax, Cotton &amp;c. to carry it on. I had &s;weet Communion with their Mini&s;ters&mdash;Our Si&s;ter, or Orphan-Hou&s;e there, is ble&s;&s;ed by their Means; and ye&s;terday was &s;et apart as a Day of Thank&s;giving, for &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tances lately &s;ent the dear Lambs from <HI>Ger|many</HI> and <HI>Savannah</HI>&mdash;The People &s;eem very grateful.

<HI>Monday, June</HI> 30. For the&s;e ten Days la&s;t pa&s;t have had frequent Communications from above, both by Way of Humiliation and Exaltation. God has often been plea&s;ed &s;ince my Return to make him&s;elf known in our Sanctuary, and cau&s;ed a mighty Power to attend the Word preached both in publick and private. I have been much refre&s;h'd with a Packet of Letters from Engli&s;h Friends.&mdash;Providence &s;eems to &s;mile upon the Orphan-Hou&s;e and to pro&s;per every Thing that I take in Hand.

In the Morning I went to Church, and heard the Commi&s;&s;ary preach. But had &s;ome infernal Spirit been &s;ent to draw my Picture, I think it &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible he could paint me in more horrid Colours.

To the Honour of God's free Grace be it &s;poken, whil&s;t he was repre&s;enting me thus, I felt the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit &s;trengthning and refre&s;hing my Soul, God at the &s;ame Time gave me to &s;ee what I was by Nature, how I had de&s;erved his eternal Wrath, and therefore I did not feel the lea&s;t Re&s;entment again&s;t the Preacher; no, I pitied, I prayed for him, and wi&s;h'd from my Soul, that the Lord would convert him, as he did once the Per&s;ecutor <HI>Saul,</HI> and let him know, that 'tis Je&s;us whom he per&s;e|cutes. In the Evening many came as I was inform'd, to hear what I would &s;ay, but as the Commi&s;&s;ary hinted that his Sermons &s;hou'd be printed, and as they were full of invidious Fal&s;hoods, I held my Tongue, and made little or no Reply. <HI>Father forgive him for he knows not what he does.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Tue&s;day, July</HI> 15. I appeared according to the Citation, at the appointed Hour and Place; there were very many Spectators, and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Garden,</HI> Commi&s;&s;ary, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Guy,</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Millichamp,</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Roe,</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Orr,</HI> &s;at as Judges, they receiv'd me with good Manners, and after the Clerk of the Court had taken a Minute of their appearing, the Commi&s;|&s;ary tender'd to me a Paper, de&s;iring my An&s;wer to tho&s;e Articles; but I refus'd taking it, till I was &s;atisfied of the Authority of the Court in Que&s;tion, adding, Do you think I would incur a a Premunire of doing what I could not an&s;wer, or Words to that Effect? He then &s;aid they would proceed to cen&s;ure: Upon which I reminded them of the Example of the Magi&s;trates, who exceeded

their Authority, in condemning and &s;courging St. <HI>Paul,</HI> being a Roman, unheard: At this one of the Clergy &s;neer'd; but the Commi&s;&s;ary replied, We &s;hall not go beyond our Power, or &s;courge you. After a &s;hort Debate, the Commi&s;&s;ary &s;ent his Ap|paritor to his Hou&s;e for his Commi&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n in order to give me Satisfaction; in about a quarter of an Hour he returned with &s;everal Bundles of Papers, out of which the Commi&s;&s;ary fir&s;t produced his Commi&s;&s;ion, to act as Commi&s;&s;ary, from the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London;</HI> I read it, and approv'd of it; but at the &s;ame Time de&s;ired to be &s;atisfied of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London'</HI>s Authority in this Province, not finding the Royal Authority underwritten, as men|tioned in his publick Citation: Upon this a Latin Commi&s;&s;ion without a Seal, was ordered to be read by the Clerk of the Court.&mdash;I objected that it was in Latin, contrary to our late Act, ordering every Thing to be in Engli&s;h; and not well under|&s;tanding the Clerk, as he read it, I de&s;ired the Peru&s;al of it my &s;elf, which was granted. I read it with an audible Voice, and after reading it, I objected, that though there might be a general Power given to the Bi&s;hop to exerci&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction in this Province, yet the Extent of that Power was to be determined by particular Acts of A&s;&s;embly. I further urged, that a Court of this Nature was entirely unprecedented in <HI>America,</HI> that I belonged to <HI>Georgia,</HI> a different Province, and was here only as an Itenerate. I al&s;o added, that my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> (though I preached in the Fields for &s;ome Months) never attempted to exerci&s;e &s;uch Authority again&s;t me. The Commi&s;&s;ary replied, Though I
<PB N="17" REF="004848_0009_100E019BFAAC14A0">
belonged to <HI>Georgia,</HI> yet I had committed Irregula|rities here, and therefore came under his Cognizance, and that what he had to lay to my Charge, might be Crimes of a different Nature.</P>
<P>Not &s;atisfied with my Objections, he ordered the Clerk to minute down that I contumaciou&s;ly con|temned the Authority of the Court, but I de&s;ired that Expre&s;&s;ion might be &s;oftned, declaring from my Heart that what I did, proceeded from a real Scruple con|cerning their Authority, urging the Example of King <HI>Charles,</HI> who, before he made An&s;wer to his Accusers, in&s;i&s;ted on knowing the Authority his Judges had to call him to an Account. I further objected that the Commi&s;&s;ary in <HI>Maryland</HI> &amp; <HI>Pen&s;ylvania</HI> were mere Cyphers&mdash;That the Tru&s;tees to my Knowledge que&s;tioned the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London'</HI>s having any Ju|ri&s;diction in the&s;e Parts, and that the Governour of <HI>Maryland</HI> acting as Ordinary, had &s;ummoned his Clergy lately to meet him as &s;uch, which accord|ingly they did: I therefore upon the whole humbly de&s;ired as a Favour from the Court, that I might have till To-morrow 9 o'Clock, the Time to which the Court was adjourned, to inform my &s;elf of the Extent of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction in this Province, a&s;&s;uring them that upon finding their Authority valid, I would immediately an&s;wer to any Interrogatories, and would be ready to re|ceive any Sentence they could with Ju&s;tice pa&s;s upon me&mdash;Tho' at my fir&s;t a&s;king, he &s;aid, he had in|dulged me too far already, yet after &s;ome Con&s;ide|ration, Mr. Commi&s;&s;ary ordered the Clerk to ra&s;e out the former Minute, and to record that upon
<PB N="18" REF="004848_0010_100E019F05F6CB60">
my &s;crupling the Authority of the Court, I was in|dulged my Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Our Lord was plea&s;ed to fulfil his Promi&s;e made to tho&s;e that &s;hould be called before Rulers, and Governours, for his Name Sake; my Soul was full of Peace; I pitied, but did not feel the lea&s;t Emo|tion of Re&s;entment again&s;t my Judges.&mdash;The Peo|ple behaved pretty quiet, but &s;ome broke out into a Laughter, &s;omething irregular, when I &s;aid the Commi&s;&s;ary in <HI>Pen&s;ylvania</HI> and <HI>Maryland</HI> were but Cyphers. This I di&s;approved of, and check'd immediately. After the Court was adjourned, and the Commi&s;&s;ary ro&s;e from his Seat I made my O|bei&s;ance, and returned to my Lodgings, thinking my &s;elf more highly honoured by my Lord this Morning, than in any other Part of my Life.&mdash;<HI>Lord &s;trengthen me in all my other impending Trials, for thy great Name's Sake,</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, July</HI> 16. Appeared this Morning at the Hour of 10 and exhibited a <HI>Recu&s;atio Judicis,</HI> i. e. my Exception again the Commi&s;&s;ary's being my Judge in this Cau&s;e, having too great Rea&s;on to believe him prejudiced again&s;t me.&mdash;At fir&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ary refu&s;ed to read it, in&s;i&s;ting to know fir&s;t, whither I acknowledged the Authority of the Court.&mdash;unwarily I an&s;wer'd, Yes. But upon the Motion of my Advocate, Mr. <HI>Rutledge,</HI> I recalled my Words, and &s;aid I admitted, and &s;ubmitted to an eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court, legally con&s;tituted. One of the Clergy on the Bench, would have in&s;i&s;ted on my fir&s;t An&s;wer;&mdash;But I told him, it was mean &s;pirited, and beneath a Court, con&s;i&s;ting of tho&s;e that call them&s;elves Mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to
<PB N="19" REF="004848_0010_100E019F05F6CB60">
catch at an Expre&s;&s;ion, which I immediately cor|rected.&mdash;Upon this the Bench agreed to alter the Minute agreeable to my la&s;t Declaration. The Commi&s;&s;ary then took my Paper, read it to him|&s;elf, and &s;aid he would not accept of it. I then &s;tood up according to Law, and &s;aid, I would go and prote&s;t again&s;t all further Proceedings as null and void, and immediately left the Court; upon Mr. <HI>Rutledge</HI> his Advice, I return'd and declared that I appeared <HI>Apud Acta</HI> to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and then withdrew a &s;econd Time.&mdash;We had not gone far from the Place of Judicature, but I was called back by the Apparitor and Regi&s;ter, we returned, and at the Commi&s;&s;ary's De&s;ire gave in my Excep|tion to be read, and filed.</P>
<P>By this Time Mr. Commi&s;&s;ary had gotten one Mr. <HI>Graham</HI> an Attorney to appear in Behalf of the Court, who in&s;i&s;ted on having the Merits of my Exceptions tried in Court, but as according to Law, I had referred them to the Examination of Six Arbitrators, Three nominated by me, and Three by the Commi&s;&s;ary; Mr. <HI>Rutledge</HI> in my Behalf prote&s;ted again&s;t all further Proceedings, and again&s;t my appearing at the next Court 'till my Reference to Arbitrators was complied with, it being quite improbable to imagine that Mr. Com|mi&s;&s;ary, who mu&s;t be judged, if my Exceptions &s;hould be tried by that Court, &s;hould allow him|&s;elf prejudiced. This <HI>Recu&s;atio Judicis</HI> I exhibited by the Advice of my Friends, not to quibble with, or evade the Force or Rigour of any Law what|&s;oever, that I might ju&s;tly fall under: For when the Articles of Impeachment were read, I found
<PB N="20" REF="004848_0011_100E01A1509BFBD0">
my&s;elf accu&s;ed only of omitting to read the Com|mon Prayer in the Pre&s;byterian Meeting at &s;uch Times as I preached there.&mdash;<HI>Oh that my Adver|&s;aries may never have any Thing wor&s;e to lay to my Charge.</HI></P>
<P>The Spectators were rather more numerous than Ye&s;terday; they behaved quietly, and were much rejoiced to &s;ee my Oppo&s;ers reduced to &s;uch a Di|lemma.&mdash;Well &s;aid the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>The Wrath of Man &s;hall turn to thy Prai&s;e. Great God, the Remainder of it do thou re&s;train, and for thy own Names &s;ake deliver me from the Hands of un|rea&s;onable Men, who out of a mi&s;guided Zeal, and without a Cau&s;e are mine Enemies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, July</HI> 17. By Advice of Mr. <HI>Rut|ledge,</HI> appeared in Court at the Time of their Meeting, to &s;ee if my Exceptions were admitted to Arbitration or repelled.&mdash;The Court being opened Mr. Commi&s;&s;ary a&s;k'd me if I was prepared to an&s;wer the Articles objected again&s;t me. I re|plied, I could give no An&s;wer till my Exceptions were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ferred to Arbitrators. Mr. <HI>Rutledge</HI> &s;tood up, and &s;pake &s;ome few Words in Vindication of my Objections, proving by a Book of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Law, that my Proceedings were according to the Rules therein pre&s;cribed. The Regi&s;ter was or|dered to read their Rea&s;ons for repelling my Ex|ceptions; Mr. <HI>Graham</HI> endeavoured to enforce, ha|ving fir&s;t laboured to prove the Juri&s;diction of the Court, and to remove the Apprehen&s;ions the Country in general or Di&s;&s;enters in particular, might entertain concerning the ill Con&s;equences of &s;uch a Court's being erected. He held on for a con&s;i|derable
<PB N="21" REF="004848_0011_100E01A1509BFBD0">
Time without Interruption, but Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|ledge</HI> ri&s;ing up to invalidate what he had &s;aid, was &s;topped: At length, therefore finding my Excepti|ons repelled, I appealed to his Maje&s;ty in the high Court of Chancery, and declared all other Pro|ceedings in that Court again&s;t me to be null and void. This cau&s;ed many to rejoice, and give Thanks unto God in my Behalf.&mdash;And my dear Redeemer to comfort my Heart, by his good Pro|vidence, at my Return to my Lodgings, &s;ent me &s;everal Letters from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> acquainting me how mightily the Word of God grew and prevai|led in tho&s;e Parts.&mdash;As al&s;o Mr. <HI>Boulton,</HI> who lately kept an A&s;&s;embly-Hou&s;e and who&s;e Daugh|ter, not long &s;ince was converted at <HI>Georgia</HI> wrote me Word that he had near fifty Negroes now lear|ning to read of him.&mdash;And further, that the Peo|ple of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> at their own Expence, and Ac|cord, were building a Place for me again&s;t Winter one hundred Feet long, &amp; &s;eventy Feet wide. <HI>Lord do thou fill it with thy Pre&s;ence, and grant that all that come thither to Wor&s;hip, may wor&s;hip thee in Spi|rit and in Truth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 19. After Evening Meeting, was de&s;ired by the Apparitor to come and wait on Mr. Commi&s;&s;ary, who was &s;itting in Court, I went. He de&s;ired me to depo&s;ite <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> Sterling and to &s;wear, that I would lodge my Appeal within a Twelve-month. My Lawyer not being pre&s;ent my Friends were too &s;ollicitous for my Non-com|pliance, but being to leave Town on Monday, and finding the Commi&s;&s;ary's printed Orders gave him Authority to require it, I took the de&s;ired Oath,
<PB N="22" REF="004848_0012_100E01A34B907EB8">
promi&s;ed to leave <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> in a Friend's Hands, but withal moved for a Copy of the Court's Pro|ceedings, which was readily complied with.&mdash;The Court being ended, the Commi&s;&s;ary de&s;ired to &s;peak with me: I a&s;k'd him to go to my Lodgings. He cho&s;e to walk in a Green near the Church: His Spirit was &s;omething calmer than u&s;ual, but after an Hour's Conver&s;ation, we were as far from agreeing as before. He charged me with &s;peaking Bla&s;phemy, for &s;aying that if it was in my Power, I would place him at the Right Hand of GOD. Upon my de&s;iring to know wherein the Bla&s;phemy con&s;i&s;ted, he replied,&mdash;<HI>Where then will you put</HI> CHRIST? I a&s;ked him, why he was guilty of that Fault which he charged me with in accu&s;ing the Methodi&s;ts in general, when he only referred to Things wrote or done by me in particular. He an&s;wer'd becau&s;e we were all of one Mind he &s;uppo&s;ed.&mdash;When I que&s;tioned him, why he ridi|cul'd me for making Grimaces in the Pulpit&mdash;when he did not come to hear me,&mdash;Why &s;ays he, as I pa&s;&s;ed by one Day, I &s;aw you &s;preading out your Hands.&mdash;I replied, did not <HI>Paul</HI> do &s;o when he began to preach? In &s;hort all his Di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent, and contrary to the Go&s;pel of our Lord, that I was obliged to tell him, that I believed him to be an unconverted Man, an Enemy to God, and of alike Spirit with the Per&s;ecutor <HI>Soul.</HI>&mdash;At this he &s;miled, and after we had walked for a long while we parted, and God gave me great Satisfaction, that I had delivered my Soul in my private Conver&s;ation with the Commi&s;&s;ary.&mdash;<HI>O

His Text was, <HI>Take heed how you hear.</HI> At fir&s;t I thought we &s;hould have a peaceable Sermon, e&s;pecially &s;ince we had convers'd before &s;o amicably, but the Gall &s;oon began to flow from his Tongue, tho' not with &s;o much Bitterne&s;s, as the la&s;t Sunday.&mdash;He endeavoured to apologize for his Proceedings, condemned all that followed me, and gave all Hopes of Heaven, that adhered to him, and the Church. In the Evening (tho' I went off my Bed to do it, and was carried in a Chai&s;e) the Lord Je&s;us &s;trengthned me to take my la&s;t Farewel of the dear People of <HI>Charles-Town.</HI>&mdash;My Soul was full of Tenderne&s;s for them, and many &s;eemed to &s;ympathize with me. Ble&s;&s;ed be God for &s;end|ing me once more among them, tho' the Heat of the Weather, and Frequency of preaching, has per|haps given an irrecoverable Stroke to the Health of my Body, yet I rejoice, knowing it has been for the Conviction, and I believe Conver&s;ion of many a Soul. Glory be to God on high, the Fields here, as well as el&s;ewhere are now white, ready unto Harve&s;t.&mdash;Numbers are &s;eeking after Je&s;us&mdash;And two or three gracious di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters, by my Advice, agreed to &s;et up a Weekly-Lecture. I advi&s;ed the People, &s;ince the Go&s;pel was not preach'd in the Church, to go and hear it in the Meeting-Hou&s;es.&mdash;May the Lord be with both Mini&s;ters and People, &amp; cau&s;e them to preach, and hear as becomes the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, What makes the Change more

remarkable in <HI>Charles-Town</HI> People, is, that they &s;eemed to me at my fir&s;t coming to be a People wholly devoted to Plea&s;ure.&mdash;One well acquainted with their Circum&s;tances, and Manners, told me more had been annually &s;pent on polite Entertain|ments, than the Poor's Rate came to, but now the Jewellers and Dancing-Ma&s;ters begin to cry out that their Craft is in Danger.&mdash;A va&s;t Alteration is di&s;cernable in the Ladies Dre&s;s.&mdash;And &s;ome, whil&s;t I have been &s;peaking, have been &s;o convinced of the Sin of wearing Jewels, that I have &s;een them with Blu&s;hes, put their Hands to their Ears, and cover them with their Fans.&mdash;But I hope the Re|formation has went farther then Externals. Many moral good &s;ort of Men, who before were &s;etled upon their Lees, have been gloriou&s;ly awakened to &s;eek after Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and many a <HI>Lydia'</HI>s Heart hath the Lord opened to receive the Things that were &s;poken.</P>

<P><HI>Friday, July</HI> 26. Took Boat before Day, and having fine Weather and a favourable Gale, reach'd <HI>Savannah,</HI> and &s;aluted my dear Family about five in the Evening.&mdash;My Body being Weak it could not bear up under the Joy and Satisfaction which I felt in my Mind, however I kneeled down, wept out a &s;hort Prayer, and Thank&s;giving, and as well as I could, told my A&s;&s;i&s;tants what God had done for my Soul.&mdash;In the Evening I expounded, and unde&s;ignedly thinking it was the Le&s;&s;on for the Night, read the la&s;t Chapter of St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s &s;econd Epi&s;tle to <HI>Timothy.</HI>&mdash;In which were the&s;e incou|raging Words.&mdash;<Q>But watch thou in all Things endure Afflictions, do the Work of an Evangeli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> make full Proof of thy Mini&s;try. <HI>Alexander</HI> the Copper&s;mith, did me much Evil; the Lord re|ward him according to his Works, of whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thou aware al&s;o, for he hath greatly with&s;tood our Words.

<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Augu&s;t</HI> 7. Continued very Weak ever &s;ince my return from <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> but was much refre&s;hed this Morning with the Sight of &s;ome dear Friends (among&s;t whom was one Mr. <HI>Tilly</HI> a gra|cious Bapti&s;t Mini&s;ter) who came in our Sloop to &s;ee the Orphan-Hou&s;e.&mdash;I gave them the Meeting at early Prayers, and God enabled me to expound with Power. <HI>Lord, let them not depart hence with|out having &s;ome &s;piritual Gift imparted to them.</HI> Amen, and Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Augu&s;t</HI> 3. Felt more than common of the divine Pre&s;ence in my Soul &s;ince the Arrival of <HI>Charles-Town</HI> Friends, who brought the Orphans many Pre&s;ents, and ble&s;&s;ed be God, for the Foot|&s;teps of his Goodne&s;s and Providence plainly di&s;|cernable among&s;t us.&mdash;But la&s;t Night thro' Weak|ne&s;s of Body, and a prodigious Concern, which lay upon my Soul, on Account of &s;ome dome&s;tick Trials, ju&s;t as I began Family-Prayer, I was &s;truck as I thought almo&s;t for Death, I put up a few bro|ken Accents, and breathed out, <HI>Lord, Je&s;us receive my Spirit.</HI> This Morning my Ma&s;ter &s;hewed me why I was thus humbled: Soon after I lo&s;e I found that Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> and his Wife of <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jonathan Bryan,</HI> Brother to Mr. <HI>Hugh Bryan,</HI> and one Mr. <HI>Bull,</HI> were come to pay us a Vi&s;it.&mdash;Tho' exceeding Weak, and I had almo&s;t laid a&s;ide Thoughts of officiating this Day, yet upon Mr. <HI>Jones'</HI>s intimating that Friends came expecting to hear me, I promi&s;ed if I could to preach, and beg'd him to read Prayers; he did, but I found my&s;elf
<PB N="30" REF="004848_0016_100E01AC30CC5328">
&s;o ill that I would fain have per&s;waded Mr. <HI>Tilly</HI> to preach for me; he peremptorily refu&s;ed, urg|ing that God wou'd &s;trengthen me if I begun.&mdash;Upon this I &s;tood up, and &s;oon found Power com|municated to me from above; I felt a &s;weet mel|ting in my Soul, and e're I had prayed long Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> dropped down as tho' &s;hot with a Gun; he &s;oon got up and &s;at attentively to hear the Sermon, the Power &s;oon &s;pread abroad, the greate&s;t Part of the Congregation was under Concern;&mdash;Tears trickled down apace. God manife&s;ted him&s;elf al&s;o much among&s;t us during the Time of the Sacra|ment: And I went home a&s;hamed that I was &s;o unwilling to preach;&mdash;I &s;tood ju&s;tly reproved, when Mr. <HI>Tilly</HI> after he came home, &s;aid, did I not tell you, God would &s;trengthen you? <HI>Deare&s;t Lord, for thy Mercies &s;ake, never let me di&s;tru&s;t thee again! Oh, me of little Faith!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday Augu&s;t</HI> 4. Was &s;ent for about Noon to &s;ee Mr. <HI>Janathan Bryan.</HI> At my coming, I found him under great Concern and &s;trong Con|victions of Sin.&mdash;Oh how did he reflect on his pa&s;t mi&s;pent Life, how did he ble&s;s God for bring|ing him to <HI>Savannah,</HI> how did he de&s;ire that he might be found in Chri&s;t e're he returned home! His Wife fat weeping by, and Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> lay on a Bed groaning in Bitterne&s;s of Soul, under a Sen&s;e of Guilt, and crying out for an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t. I a&s;ked him what cau&s;ed him to fall down Ye&s;ter|day? He an&s;wer'd, <HI>The Power of GOD's Word!</HI> After about half an Hour's Conver&s;ation on the Nature of the New-Birth, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;aving Clo&s;ure with the Lord Chri&s;t, I kneel|ed

<P><HI>Sunday, Augu&s;t</HI> 9. Went on Tue&s;day with Mr. <HI>Bryan, Jones,</HI> &amp;c. to <HI>Bethe&s;da,</HI> and had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the Work of God much car|ried on in mo&s;t of our Vi&s;iters Hearts. It was but &s;eldom I could Officiate, but when I did, the Lord generally cau&s;ed the Word to come with very great Power. This Morning I expounded early, as u&s;ual, and read Part of the Prayers at 10 o'Clock, but got Mr. <HI>Tilly</HI> to preach, who tho' a Bapti&s;t Mini&s;ter, joined with us in receiving the Sacrament in the Church of <HI>England</HI> Way; and the King was plea&s;ed to &s;it at his Table; he bro't us into his Banqueting-Hou&s;e, and cau&s;ed it to be a Fea&s;t of fat Things to our Souls. Many I believe fed on Je&s;us in their Hearts with Thank&s;giving. After the Ordinance was over, the Lord enlarged my Heart, and I prayed as the Spirit gave me Ut|terance. I went home much refre&s;hed in Soul, but &s;o weak in Body, that I declined going to publick Wor&s;hip in the Afternoon. In the mean while, God gave me a fre&s;h Supply of Strength; about the Evening when my Friends were &s;itting down to|gether, finding the Power of the Lord come upon me, I began to &s;peak to them of the Things of God. A great Alteration was &s;oon di&s;cernable in mo&s;t of the Company, their Concern gradually increa&s;ed, 'till many bur&s;t into Floods of Tears, and one fell on the Ground. E'er I had done, &s;ome of my Pari&s;hioners came up, and the re&s;t of my Family,
<PB N="32" REF="004848_0017_100E01AE08B969E8">
they al&s;o felt the divine Power. When I had done &s;peaking to them from God, I &s;poke for them in Prayer to God, my Soul was carried as it were out of the Body, and I was enabled mightily to wre&s;tle with our Lord in their Behalf. He did not let us go without a Ble&s;&s;ing. The Room was filled with the Cries of tho&s;e around me, and many I believe at that Time &s;ought Je&s;us &s;orrowing. The Concern continued after the Duty was over. Several, were in great Agonies of Soul, and a <HI>Che|roke</HI> Indian Trader, who providentially was pre&s;ent de&s;ired to &s;peak with me, &s;aying he never &s;aw the like before. Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> al&s;o of <HI>Port-Royal</HI> who went away on Friday but was forced back and of|ficiated for me the Afternoon at <HI>Savannah</HI> told a Friend, that &s;urely God was with us. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be his rich &s;overeign and di&s;tingui&s;hing Grace; Lord make me lowly in my own Eyes, and cau&s;e me &s;till to go on from conquering to conquer.

Several Times I was &s;o weak before I begun to preach, that I tho't it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould go thro' half a Di&s;cour&s;e,
<PB N="35" REF="004848_0018_100E01B07708BEC0">
but the Lord quickned, enlightned &amp; comforted me above Mea&s;ure.&mdash;Out of Weakne&s;s I became &s;trong, and the Lord manife&s;ted him&s;elf in the Sanctuary.&mdash;The Audiences were more numerous than ever, and it was &s;uppo&s;ed not le&s;s than 4000 were in, and about the Meeting-Hou&s;e when I preached my Farewell-Sermon.&mdash;The Commi&s;&s;ary, having run his utmo&s;t length, thought it be&s;t to &s;ay no more him&s;elf.&mdash;But he employed one Mr.<HI>Rowe</HI> to preach for him, who told the People, that becau&s;e of their Wicked|ne&s;s, God had &s;ent them &s;trong Delu&s;ions that they might believe a Lie. Finding when I was here la&s;t that Je&s;us Chri&s;t was not preached in the Church, my Con&s;cience, would not &s;uffer me to attend on tho&s;e that preached there any more. I therefore went to the Bapti&s;t and Independent Meeting-Hou&s;e, where Je&s;us Chri&s;t I hope was preached in Sincerity.&mdash;I likewi&s;e admini&s;tred the Sacrament thrice in a private Hou&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> Ye&s;terday was &s;ev'n-night, Ye&s;terday and this Morning,&mdash;Never did I &s;ee any Thing more &s;olemn, the Room was large and mo&s;t were di&s;&s;olved into Tears as tho' they were weeping at their Saviour's Cro&s;s.

how God was among&s;t us Ye&s;terday, de&s;ired I would admini&s;ter to them to Day.&mdash;I did, and our Lord was with us again. Having more Lei&s;ure from my private Studies, by Rea&s;on my Weakne&s;s would not permit me to read much&punc; I had better Opportunities of conver&s;ing with and confirming tho&s;e that were under Convictions, mo&s;t of 'em I found grown in Grace and their Hearts &s;oftned by redeeming Love.

Great, very great Alteration is made in the Life, and Manners of mo&s;t of the polite Ladies; the Rooms that were u&s;ually employed for Balls and A&s;&s;emblies were now turned into So|ciety-Rooms.&mdash;Every Night where I was invited to Supper, it became cu&s;tomary to have the Hou&s;e filled with Company, whom the Lord enabled me to pray with and exhort with great Power, but once I was &s;o weak, that I was obliged to be led home: Many came to me in private under the deepe&s;t Convictions.&mdash;Several were e&s;teemed mad by their Relations. One young Lady in particular for &s;ome little Time was turned out of Doors, but

<P><HI>Sunday, Sept.</HI> 14.

Once I called the People, but &s;omething prevented their coming, at la&s;t finding my Impre&s;&s;ion increa&s;e upon me, I de&s;ired their Attendance immediately: They came with a &s;trong A&s;&s;urance we &s;hould be heard.

&s;ilently admiring God's Goodne&s;s in an&s;wering my Prayers, &s;o minutely.

and Three in the Afternoon. After this I went and waited on the Governour, who &s;eemed to be a very plain Man, and had a very plain Hou&s;e, which much plea&s;ed me: By Profe&s;&s;ion, I think he is a &s;eventh Day Bapti&s;t; he is a Man of good Re|port as to his Conduct and dealing with the World. After a &s;hort Vi&s;it, I returned to take my Leave of Mr. <HI>Honeyman,</HI> and to fetch my Friends who were at his Hou&s;e, waiting for me.

<SALUTE>Reverend Sir and beloved Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALtho' mine Eyes never &s;aw your Face before this Day, yet my Heart and Soul have been united to you in Love by the Bond of the Spirit. I have longed, and expected to &s;ee you for many Months pa&s;t: Ble&s;&s;ed be God, mine Eyes have &s;een the joyful Day. I tru&s;t thro' Grace, I have &s;ome Things to communi|cate to you, that will make your Heart glad: I &s;hall omit writing any thing, and only hereby pre&s;ent my hearty Love, and let you know that I am waiting now at the Po&s;t of your Door for Admi&s;&s;ion; tho' I am unworthy, my Lord is Worthy, in who&s;e Name I tru&s;t I come. I am your unworthy Brother,</P>

On Reading it, I could not but think, this was one of tho&s;e young Mini&s;ters whom God had late|ly made u&s;e of in &s;uch a remarkable Manner at the Ea&s;t-End of <HI>Long-I&s;land.</HI> I &s;ent for him, and found he was the Man. My Heart rejoiced. We walked out, and took &s;weet Coun&s;el together, and among&s;t other Things, he told me that he came to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> under a full Conviction, that he &s;hould &s;ee me there, and had been waiting for me eight Days; for he &s;aid the&s;e Words were migh|tily impre&s;&s;ed upon his Heart, <HI>Is not</HI> Aaron <HI>the</HI> Levite <HI>thy Brother? I know that he can &s;peak well; and al&s;o behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and when he &s;eeth thee, he will be glad in his Heart; and I will be with thy Mouth, and with his Mouth, and will teach you what ye &s;hall do.</HI> What render'd this more remarkable was, I had no intention of &s;ailing into <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> 'till about three Days be|fore I left <HI>Carolina;</HI> and al&s;o, I had a great De&s;ire to put in, if I could, at the Ea&s;t-End of <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> to &s;ee this very Per&s;on, whom the great God now brought unto me. <HI>Lord accept our Thanks, &s;anctify our Meeting, and teach us both what we &s;hall do for thy own Name Sake.</HI></P>
<P>After a long Conference, we took leave of each other for the Pre&s;ent, but agreed that we &s;hould now be Companions in Travel, 'till the Lord &s;hou'd make our Way more plain. In the Even|ing I went to venerable Mr. <HI>Clap'</HI>s and exhorted, and prayed with a great Multitude who not only crowded into the Hou&s;e but thronged every Way about it; the dear old Man rejoiced to &s;ee tho&s;e Things which he &s;aw; and after my Exhortation

was over, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me with his Ble&s;&s;ing. <HI>Lord Je&s;us, do thou &s;ay Amen to it, even &s;o Lord Je&s;us.</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, Sept.</HI> 16. Perceived my &s;elf a little low in the Morning, but was enabled to read Prayers, and preach with much Flame, Clearne&s;s and Power, to &s;till greater Auditories than Ye&s;terday; it being A&s;&s;embly Time, the Gentlemen adjourned, in or|der to attend the Service; and &s;everal Invitations were given me to come to other adjacent Places. The People were exceedingly attentive, Tears trickled down their Cheeks and &s;o far prevailed with me by their Importunity, that by the divine Permi&s;&s;ion, I promi&s;ed to call on them in my Re|turn from <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> When I came home to my Lodgings, the Woman of the Hou&s;e &s;aluted me with <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed art thou of the Lord.</HI> I looked round to &s;ee the Rea&s;on of &s;uch a Salutation, and on the Couch there lay a young Woman; after a little Conver&s;ation, I found &s;he had had a gracious Di&s;|covery of the Lord Je&s;us made to her Soul when I was &s;peaking the&s;e Words, <HI>Come &s;ee a Man that told me all Things that ever I did.</HI> She &s;aid, &s;he had often grieved the Spirit of God, but now &s;he believed the Lord was calling her home effectually. The Word, added &s;he, came with &s;uch Power, that I was obliged to go out of the Church, other|wi&s;e I mu&s;t have di&s;turbed the Congregation. When I came from Home contrary to my Mo|ther's Inclinations, I in&s;i&s;ted, I knew not why, on &s;taying at <HI>Newport</HI> &s;ix Weeks. She would have me &s;tay only a Month, but at la&s;t con&s;ented for me to &s;tay my own Time. To-morrow, &s;ays &s;he,

is the la&s;t Day of the &s;ix Weeks, and Oh the Good|ne&s;s of God in &s;ending you ju&s;t now, before my Time was out; or Words to that Effect. After|wards one or two more came under deep Convicti|ons, crying out, in the Bitterne&s;s of their Souls, after the Lord Je&s;us.&mdash;I prayed with each of them, and exhorted 'em not to re&s;t till they found re&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t: In the Evening I went, as I thought privately to a Friends Hou&s;e, but the People were &s;o eager after the Word that in a &s;hort Time I believe more then 1000 were before the Door be&s;ides tho&s;e that were within, and filled every Room in the Hou&s;e, I therefore &s;tood upon the Thre&s;hold and &s;poke for near an Hour on the&s;e Words, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that hunger and thir&s;t after Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s for they &s;hall be filled.</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed be God it was a very &s;olemn Meeting. Being Night, I could not &s;ee how the Hearers were affected, but the Lord a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in &s;peaking. Glory be to his great Name. Before I retired to Bed, I went, and took my Leave of Mr. <HI>Honeyman,</HI> &amp; had &s;ome clo&s;e Talk with him about the New-Birth. The Lord give him an experimental Knowledge of it; he was very Civil, and would have had me &s;taid with him longer, but being to go on a Journey, on the Mor|row, after we had conver&s;ed about half an Hour, I took my Leave. At my Return to my Lodg|ings, good old Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> went with me into a Room, and gave me &s;omething for my Orphans, and &s;poke many affectionate Things to me. Altho' very old yet he followed me from one End of the Town to the other, &s;o that People &s;aid I had made Mr. <HI>Clap</HI> young again. Oh what a <HI>Crown of Glory is

the hoary Head when found in the Way of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI> He was exceeding de&s;irous of my coming to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> again, which I promi&s;ed to do by the divine Permi&s;&s;ion. For <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> &s;eems to be a Place where much Good may be done. They are a very plain People for the Generality; tho' I ob&s;erved there were &s;ome fooli&s;h Virgins at Church, covered over with the Pride of Life; I find they are &s;adly divided among&s;t them&s;elves, as to outward Things. I think there are no le&s;s than four different Congregations of Bapti&s;ts; two of the Independ|ants, and one of the Quakers Per&s;ua&s;ion. Dean <HI>Berkly'</HI>s Name is had in much Re&s;pect. Among&s;t them, the establi&s;hed Church is in good Order as to Externals: But many of the Head Members, I found &s;oon were exceeding great Bigots; they &s;eem|ed very fearful lea&s;t I &s;hould preach in Mr. <HI>Clap'</HI>s Meeting-Hou&s;e, and gloried much in my bringing the good old Man to Church: Nor is there le&s;s Bigotry, as far as I could find among tho&s;e of other Communions, all I fear Place the Kingdom of God too much in Meats and Drinks, and have an ill Name abroad for running of Goods. One Day when I &s;aid in my Sermon, <Q>What will become of you, who cheat the King of his Taxes</Q>? The whole Congregation &s;eemed &s;urprized, and look'd on one another as tho' they &s;hould &s;ay we are guilty. <HI>Lord Je&s;us give them to know thee, and the Power of thy Re&s;urrection, and teach them to render to Cae&s;ar the Things that are Cae&s;ar's and to God the Things that are God's.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Newport and Bri&s;tol.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, Sept.</HI> 17. Left <HI>Newport</HI> in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> about 9 in the Morning, and reach'd <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> a Town twelve Miles off about Noon; &s;everal Friends from <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> accompanied me, and before we came to the Town, a di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ter, as I found afterwards,&mdash;met me, and in the Name of the Court which was then &s;itting at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> invited me and my Friends to dine with them, and al&s;o to give them a Sermon. I complied. The Gentlemen received us with much Civility, and after Dinner, I preached in the Meeting-Hou&s;e to more People, than might be expected on &s;uch &s;ud|den Notice. My Heart was much &s;hut up in the Excerci&s;e; I felt and &s;aw but little Power, how|ever the Gentlemen &s;eem'd very thankful. I took my Leave about 4 in the Afternoon, and lay at an Inn about ten Miles farther on the Road. Here the Lord gave me a Spirit of Prayer, I wre&s;tled with God in Behalf of my Self and Friends, &s;upp'd comfortably, &s;ung a Hymn and went to Re&s;t.&mdash;<HI>Thanks be to God for his un&s;peakable Mercies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Sept.</HI> 18. Ro&s;e a great while before Day, and &s;et out as &s;oon as it was Light, break|fa&s;ted at a Mini&s;ter's Hou&s;e on the Road, found the People were appri&s;ed of my coming, and were &s;olicitous for my Preaching. But being re&s;olved under God if po&s;&s;ible to reach <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> that Night, we travel'd on for near fifty Miles, and came to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> about 8 in the Evening; when we were within four Miles of the Town, the Governour's Son, and &s;everal other Gentlemen, and one or two
<PB N="47" REF="004848_0024_100E01BDE5B8F798">
Mini&s;ters, waited at a Gentleman's Hou&s;e to give me the Meeting. They received me with great Gladne&s;s and told me many more would have come, had not a large Funeral been in the Town, or if there had been more certain Notice of my arriving. This rejoiced me, for I think I can &s;tand any thing better then this. It favours too much of hu|mane Grandure. But I mu&s;t be tryed every Way. The Lord be my Helper. After &s;topping a little while, we went altogether in Company to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to the Hou&s;e of one Mr. <HI>Staniford,</HI> Brother in Law to Dr. <HI>Colman,</HI> who long &s;ince had &s;ent me an Invitation. Several Mini&s;ters and other Gentlemen came in to pay their Re&s;pects. My Heart was but low, and my Body weak, but at the Reque&s;t of one of the Mini&s;ters I gave Thanks to our gracious God for bringing me in Safety, and prayed that my coming might be in the Fulne&s;s of the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Go&s;|pel of Peace. We then parted, I eat a little Sup|per and then retired, be&s;eeching the Lord to rai&s;e my Heart and make his Power known in the Hearts of his People. <HI>Even &s;o Lord Je&s;us,</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, Sept.</HI> 19. Slept pretty well, and in the Morning perceived fre&s;h Emanations of Divine Light break in upon, and refre&s;h my Soul. Was vi&s;ited by &s;everal Gentlemen, and Mini&s;ters, and went to the Governour's with <HI>Jo&s;iah Willard,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> Secretary of the Province, a Man fearing God, and with whom, (tho' before unknown in Per&s;on) I have corre&s;ponded for &s;ome Time. The Governour received me, with the utmo&s;t Re|&s;pect, he &s;eemed to favour the Things which were
<PB N="48" REF="004848_0025_100DEEEEB11A05C8">
of God, and de&s;ired me to come and &s;ee him as often as I could. At 11 o'Clock I went to pub|lick Wor&s;hip at the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and after|wards waited on the Commi&s;&s;ary Home who read Prayers. He received me very courteou&s;ly, and it being a Day, whereon the Clergy of the E&s;tabli&s;h|ed Church met, I had the Opportunity of conver&s;|ing with Five of 'em together. I think one of them fir&s;t began with me for calling that <HI>Tennent</HI> and his Brethren faithful Mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? I an&s;wered, I believed they were. They then que&s;|tioned me about the Validity of Pre&s;byterian Ordination? I replied, I believed it was valid. They then urged again&s;t me a Pa&s;&s;age in my fir&s;t Journal where I &s;aid, <Q>That a Bapti&s;t Mini&s;ter at <HI>Deal,</HI> did not give me a &s;atis|factory An&s;wer, concerning his Mi&s;&s;ion.</Q> I an&s;wered, Perhaps my Sentiments were altered. And is Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> altered in his Sentiments too &s;aid one, for he was very &s;trenuous for the Church, and again&s;t all other Forms of Government when he was at <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> I an&s;wered, he was then a great Bigot, but God had &s;ince enlarged his Heart, and I believed he was like minded with me, as to this Particular. I then urged, that a Catholick Spirit was be&s;t, and that a Bapti&s;t Mini&s;ter had commu|nicated with me lately at <HI>Savannah:</HI> And I &s;up|po&s;e, &s;ays another Clergyman, you wou'd do him as good a Turn, and communicate with him. I an&s;wered, yes. I then urged, that it was be&s;t, to preach up the New-Birth, and the Power of God|line&s;s, and not to in&s;i&s;t &s;o much on the Form, for People would never be brought to one Mind, as to
<PB N="49" REF="004848_0025_100DEEEEB11A05C8">
that, nor did Je&s;us Chri&s;t ever intend it. Yes, but &s;ays Dr. <HI>Cutler,</HI> he did. How do you prove it? <HI>Why,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>our Lord prayed, that all might be one even as thou Father, and I are one.</HI> I reply|ed, that was &s;poken of the inward Union of the Souls of Believers with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and not of the outward Church. <HI>That cannot be,</HI> (&s;ays Dr. <HI>Cutler</HI>) <HI>for how then could it be &s;aid, That the World might know, that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me?</HI> He then taking it for granted, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> was the only true apo&s;tolical Church, drew a Parallel be|tween the Jewi&s;h, and our Church, urging, <HI>How God required all Things to be made according to the Pattern given on the Mount.</HI> I an&s;wer'd; Before the Parallel could be ju&s;t, it mu&s;t be proved, that every Thing enjoined in our Church was as much a divine In&s;titution as any Rite or Ceremony under the Jewi&s;h Di&s;pen&s;ation. I added farther, That I &s;aw regenerate Souls among the Bapti&s;ts, among the Pre&s;byterians, among the Independants, and among the Church Folks; all Children of God, and yet all born again in a different Way of Wor|&s;hip; and who then can tell which is the mo&s;t evan|gelical? <HI>What,</HI> &s;ays the Commi&s;&s;ary, <HI>can you &s;ee Regeneration with your Eyes?</HI> or &s;omething to that Purpo&s;e. Soon after we began to talk of the RIGH|TEOUSNESS OF CHRIST: And the Commi&s;&s;ary &s;aid <HI>Chri&s;t was to make up the Defects of our Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> I a&s;k'd him, if Conver&s;ion was not in|&s;tantanious? He was unwilling to confe&s;s it; but having ju&s;t before bapti&s;ed an Infant at publick Wor&s;hip; I a&s;k'd him, Whether he believed that very In&s;tant in which he &s;prinkled the Child with
<PB N="50" REF="004848_0026_100E01C28041F2D0">
Water, the Holy Gho&s;t fell upon the Child? He an&s;wer'd, <HI>Yes.</HI> Then, &s;ays I, according to your own Principles, Regeneration is in&s;tantanious, and &s;ince you will judge of the New-Birth by the Fruits, pray watch that Child, and &s;ee if it brings forth the Fruits of the Spirit. I al&s;o &s;aid, That if every Child was really born again in Bapti&s;m, then every bapti&s;ed Infant would be &s;aved. <HI>And &s;o they are,</HI> &s;ays Dr. <HI>Cutler.</HI> How do you prove that? <HI>Why,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the Rubrick &s;ays, That all Infants dying af|ter Bapti&s;m, before they commit actual Sin, are un|doubtedly &s;aved.</HI> I a&s;k'd, What Text of Scripture there was to prove it? <HI>Here,</HI> &s;ays he (holding a Prayer-Book in his Hand) <HI>the Church &s;ays &s;o.</HI> We then ju&s;t hinted at Prede&s;tination: I &s;aid, I &s;ub|&s;cribed to the 17th Article of the Church in its plain literal Sen&s;e, with all my Heart. We then talk'd a little about finally falling away from Grace. I &s;aid, a true Child of God, though he might fall fouly, yet could never fall finally. <HI>But,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the Article &s;ays, Men, may fall away from Grace given.</HI> But then, &s;ays I, ob&s;erve what follows, <HI>And by the Grace of God, they may ri&s;e again.</HI> Se|veral other Things of le&s;s Con&s;equence pa&s;&s;ed be|tween us; but being engag'd to dine at my Lodg|ing, and finding how incon&s;i&s;tent they were, I took my Leave, re&s;olving they &s;hould not have the Opportunity of denying me their Pulpits. How|ever, they treated me with more Civility than any Set of our own Clergymen have done a long While.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ary very kindly urged me to dine with him, but being pre-engaged, I went to my Lodging, and in the Afternoon preached to about

4000 People in Dr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s Meeting-Hou&s;e, and as afterwards, I was told by &s;everal, with great Suc|ce&s;s. In the Evening, I exhorted and prayed, with as many as came to my Lodgings, and in|wardly rejoiced at the Pro&s;pect there was of bring|ing many Souls in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to the &s;aving Knowledge of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Grant this O Father for thy dear Son's &s;ake.</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 20.

I know no &s;uch Thing a&s;&s;erted in the Go&s;pel, if explain'd aright. <HI>Lord, do thou cau&s;e even this to Work for Good, and give me Grace to oppo&s;e &s;uch Errors, without Re&s;pect to Per&s;ons, but with Meekne&s;s, Humility, and Love, Amen, Lord Je&s;us,</HI> Amen, and Amen.</P>
<P>Preached in the Morning with much Freedom and Power, to about 6000 Hearers in Dr. <HI>Sewall</HI>'s Meeting-Hou&s;e, afterwards on the Common to a|bout 8000, and again at Night to a thronged Company at my own Lodgings; and then &s;pent the Remainder of the Evening with a few choice Friends in preparing for the Sabbath. <HI>Oh that it may be a Day of heavenly Re&s;t, &s;acred to divine Love.

<HI>Sunday, Sept.</HI> 21. Went this Morning to hear Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> preach; din'd with his Colleague Mr. <HI>Cooper,</HI> and preach'd in the Afternoon to a very thronged Auditory, and with great and vi&s;ible Effects at Mr. <HI>Foxcroft'</HI>s Meeting-Hou&s;e: Imme|diately after on the Common to about 15,000, and again at my Lodging as u&s;ual, to a greater Com|pany than before, &s;ome afterwards came up into my Room, I felt much of the divine Pre&s;ence in my own Soul; and though hoar&s;e, was enabled to &s;peak with much Power, and could have &s;poke I believe 'till Midnight.

<P><HI>Monday, Sept.</HI> 22. Preached in the Morning at Mr. <HI>Webb'</HI>s Meeting-Hou&s;e, to about 6000 Hear|ers in the Hou&s;e, be&s;ides great Numbers &s;tanding about the Doors. The Pre&s;ence of the Lord was among&s;t them. Look where I would around me, vi&s;ible Impre&s;&s;ions were made upon the Auditory; Mo&s;t wept for a con&s;iderable Time. But what I mu&s;t give the Preference to, was that gracious Sea&s;on at the New-North, on Wedne&s;day the 8th of <HI>October,</HI> where there was more of the Pre|&s;ence of God through the whole of the Mini&s;tra|tion, than ever I had known at one Time through the whole Cour&s;e of my Life. Ju&s;tly might it have been &s;aid of that Place, <HI>It was no other than the Hou&s;e of God and the Gate of Heaven.</HI> Oh how dreadful was the Places and yet Oh how

But Oh, how few were prepared for &s;o holy an Inqui&s;ition?

Weather was wet, but above eight Thou&s;and fol|lowed into the Fields, to whom, I preached from the&s;e Words, <HI>Go out into the High-Ways &amp; Hedges and compel them to come in.</HI> I endeavour'd, as God ena|bled me, to improve what had befallen us, and tho' Satan in this has brui&s;ed our Heels; yet I doubt not but even this will be a Means of brui&s;ing his accur&s;ed Head. <HI>Lord thy Judgments are like the great Deep, thy Foot&s;teps are not known, ju&s;t and holy art thou, O King of Saints.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening perceived my&s;elf weak in Body &s;o that I could not &s;ay much at the Hou&s;e where I &s;upped; but God, by his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, greatly refre&s;hed and comforted my Soul. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, I find what our Saviour &s;ays, exceeding true, <HI>He that believeth on me as the Scripture hath &s;poken, out of his Belly &s;hall flow Rivers of living Waters.</HI> I drink of God's Plea&s;ures as out of a River. <HI>Oh that all were made Partakers of this living Water,</HI>&mdash;<HI>they would never thir&s;t after the deadly Plea&s;ures of this lower World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, Sept.</HI> 23. Went this Morning with Dr. <HI>Colman</HI> and the Secretary to <HI>Roxbury,</HI> three Miles from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> to &s;ee one Mr. <HI>Walter,</HI> a good old Puritan, who with his Predece&s;&s;or Mr. <HI>Eliot,</HI> commonly called the Apo&s;tle of the Indians, but now with God, have been Pa&s;tors of that Congre|gation 106 Years. I had but little Conver&s;ation with him, my Stay was &s;o very &s;hort; but I re|member he told me, he was glad to hear I &s;aid, <HI>Man was half a Devil, and half a Bea&s;t.</HI> The more People drink into God's Spirit, the more I find they are inclined to deba&s;e the natural Man.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="004848_0028_100E01C70631C8F0">
About 11 we returned, and I preached in Mr. <HI>Gee'</HI>s Meeting-Hou&s;e, but not to a very crowded Auditory, becau&s;e People were in doubt where I would preach. Dined at the Secretary's. Preach|ed in the Afternoon at Dr. <HI>Sewall'</HI>s to a thronged Congregation, and exhorted and prayed as u&s;ual at my own Lodging; at neither Place without &s;ome Manife&s;tation of a divine Power accompanying the Word.&mdash;<HI>Lord, let thy Pre&s;ence always follow me, or otherwi&s;e I &s;hall be but as a &s;ounding Bra&s;s, or a tinkling Cymbal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, Sept.</HI> 24. Went this Morning to &s;ee and preach at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the chief College for training up the Sons of the Prophets in all <HI>New-England.</HI> It has one Pre&s;ident, four Tutors, up|wards of one hundred Students: It is &s;carce as big as one of our lea&s;t Colleges in <HI>Oxford;</HI> and as far as I could gather from &s;ome who well knew the State of it, not far &s;uperiour to our Univer&s;ities in Piety and true Godline&s;s.&mdash;Tutors neglect to pray with and examine the Hearts of their Pupils. Di&s;cipline is at too low an Ebb: Bad Books are become fa&s;hionable among&s;t them:&mdash;<HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> and <HI>Clark</HI> are read in&s;tead of <HI>Sheppard, Stoddard,</HI> and &s;uch like evangelical Writers, and therefore I cho&s;e to preach from tho&s;e Words, <HI>We are not as many who corrupt the Word of God:</HI> And in the Conclu&s;ion of my Sermon, I made a clo&s;e Ap|plication to Tutors and Students. A great Num|ber of neighbouring Mini&s;ters attended, as indeed, they do at all other Times, and God gave me great Freedom and Boldne&s;s of Speech. The Pre&s;ident of the College, and Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h, treated
<PB N="56" REF="004848_0029_100E01C88F7B9B98">
me very civilly. In the Afternoon I preached again in the College-Yard, without particular Ap|plication to the Students: I believe there were 7000 Hearers:&mdash;The Holy Spirit melted many Hearts. The Word was attended with a mani|fe&s;t Power: And a Mini&s;ter &s;oon after wrote me Word, that he believed one of his Daughters was &s;avingly wrought upon at that Time. <HI>Lord, add daily to thy Church &s;uch as &s;hall he &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>Paid my Re&s;pects to the Lieutenant Gover|nour, who lives at <HI>Cambridge;</HI> returned in the Evening to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and exhorted and prayed with many People, who were waiting round the Door for a &s;piritual Mor&s;el. I believe our Lord did not &s;end them empty away. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, Feed them all with the Bread of Life which cometh down from Heaven.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Sept.</HI> 25. Preached the Weekly-Lec|ture at Mr. <HI>Foxcroft'</HI>s Meeting-Hou&s;e, but was &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a Sen&s;e of my ba&s;e Ingratitude to my deare&s;t Saviour, that Satan would fain have tempted me to hold my Tongue, and not invite poor Sinners to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, becau&s;e I was &s;o great a Sinner my &s;elf: But God enabled me to with|&s;tand the Temptation: And &s;ince Je&s;us Chri&s;t had &s;hewn &s;uch Mercy to and did not withdraw his Holy Spirit from me, the chief of Sinners, I was enabled the more feelingly to talk of his Love: And afterwards found that one Stranger in parti|cular, was in all Probability, effectually convinced by that Morning's Sermon. After publick Wor|&s;hip, I went at his Excellency's Invitation, and dined with the Governour; mo&s;t of the Mini&s;ters
<PB N="57" REF="004848_0029_100E01C88F7B9B98">
of the Town were invited with me. Before Din|ner, the Governour &s;ent for me up into his Cham|ber: He wept, wi&s;h'd me good Succe&s;s in the Name of the Lord, and recommended him&s;elf, Mini&s;ters, and People to my Prayers. Immediately after Dinner, at the Governour's Motion, I prayed ex|plicitly for them all; went in his Coach to the End of the Town, but had &s;uch a Sen&s;e of my Vilene&s;s upon my Soul, that I wondred People did not &s;tone me. Cro&s;s'd the Ferry, and preached at <HI>Charle&s;town,</HI> a Town lying on the North-Side of <HI>Bo&s;ton:</HI> The Meeting-Hou&s;e was very capacious, and quite filled; a gracious Melting was di&s;cerna|ble thro' the whole Congregation, and I perceived much Freedom and Sweetne&s;s in my own Soul; tho' the Damp I felt in the Morning was not quite gone off. <HI>Oh when &s;hall I be free from in|dwelling-Sin! O Lord deliver me from the Body of this Death.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening I exhorted and prayed as u&s;ual at my Lodging: And ble&s;&s;ed be God, I found a great Alteration in the Hearers; they now be|gan to melt and weep under the Word. <HI>Oh that the Lord may beat them down with the Hammer of his Word, 'till the Heart of Stone be entirely taken away. Even &s;o Lord Je&s;us,</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, Sept.</HI> 26. Preach'd in the Morning at <HI>Roxbury</HI> from a little A&s;cent to many Thou&s;ands of People, with much of the divine Pre&s;ence among&s;t us. Several I think came afterwards to me telling how they were &s;truck at that Time under the Word, and a Mini&s;ter wrote to me thus,</P>

One Man was, I believe, &s;truck down by the Power of the Word. In every Part of the Congregation Per&s;ons might be &s;een under great Concern: One Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> a good Mini&s;ter, as is granted by all Lovers of God, &s;eemed to be almo&s;t in Heaven. <HI>Salem</HI> is the fir&s;t &s;ettled, and except <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the large&s;t Town in all <HI>New-England;</HI> but rather, as far as I could &s;ee and hear, excells it for Politene&s;s.

Lord, heal their Divi&s;ions, and grant that with one Heart and one Mind they may endeavour to glorify thy holy Name. After the Exerci&s;e, I immediately &s;et out and got to <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> another large Town, 16 Miles (the Way we went) di&s;tant from <HI>Salem.</HI> Two or three Gentlemen came to meet me, and I and my Friends were kindly entertain'd at the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>R</HI>&mdash;<HI>rs,</HI> one of the Mini&s;ters of the Place. <HI>The Lord reward him, and all others a thou&s;and Fold, who refre&s;h our Bowels in the Lord.</HI></P>

Seeing no immediate Effects of the Word preach'd, I was a little de|jected; but God to comfort my Heart, &s;ent one young Man, crying out in great Angui&s;h of Spirit, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI> Oh, how does God pity the Weakne&s;s of his Children, why wa&s;t thou &s;o ca&s;t down O my Soul?

<P><HI>Thur&s;day, October</HI> 2. Was much comforted to hear good Mr. <HI>Moody</HI> tell me, that he believed I &s;hou'd preach to an Hundred new Creatures this Morning in his Congregation: and indeed I be|lieve I did; for when I came to preach I could &s;peak little or no Terror, but mo&s;t Con&s;olation: I preach'd both Morning and Evening. The Hearers looked plain and &s;imple, and Tears trick|led apace down mo&s;t of their Cheeks. Indeed we &s;aw the Outgoings of the Lord in his Sanctuary. But one Thing put a little Damp upon my Soul, and I hope did me good. Mr. <HI>Moody</HI> has a Son a Mini&s;ter, who was once full of Faith and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, and walk'd in the Light of God's Countenance, and made full Proof of his Mini&s;try, but for the&s;e two Years la&s;t pa&s;t, has walked in Darkne&s;s, and &s;aw no Light. He has an inexpre&s;|&s;ible Gloomine&s;s upon his Soul, and cannot apply any of the Promi&s;es to him&s;elf. I was informed that he was at Meeting, but dared not &s;ee me: I was a&s;&s;i&s;ted to pray for him, and &s;o much the more earne&s;tly, not knowing but his Ca&s;e might be mine hereafter. <HI>Lord, let me not be high minded, but fear; into thy Hands I commend my Spirit; I de|&s;ire to take no Thought for the Morrow; deal with me as &s;hall plea&s;e thee.

In&s;tead of preaching to dead Stocks, I now had Rea&s;on to believe I was preaching to living Men. People began to melt, &s;oon after I began to pray, and the Power encrea&s;ed more and more, during the whole Sermon.

<P><HI>Tue&s;day, Octob.</HI> 7. Preach'd both Morning and Evening in Dr. <HI>Colmans'</HI>s Meeting-Hou&s;e; both Times with much Power. People &s;eem'd greatly rejoiced at my Arrival, it being confidently reported that I died &s;uddenly, or was poi&s;oned: But I find I mu&s;t not yet die, but live and declare the Works of the Lord. Father, I &s;ubmit; thy Will be done. Vi&s;ited I believe a true Di&s;ciple, who had been &s;ick for a long Sea&s;on; the Lord has made his Bed in his Sickne&s;s.

Supped and gave a Word of Exhortation to many People at a Hou&s;e, which I tru&s;t the Lord will vi&s;it with his Salvation. Wherever I go, People will follow me: And I now hourly almo&s;t receive Let|ters from Per&s;ons under Convictions, and congra|tulatory Letters and Vi&s;its from many Children of God, who&s;e Souls have been abundantly refre&s;hed by the Mini&s;tration of the Word. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be God,

<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, Octob.</HI> 8. Went with the Gover|nour in his Coach to Mr. <HI>Webb'</HI>s Meeting-Hou&s;e, where I preached both Morning and Evening to very great Auditories both Times, e&s;pecially in the Morning: Je&s;us Chri&s;t manife&s;ted forth his Glory; many Hearts melted within them; &amp; I think I was never &s;o drawn out to pray for and invite little Children to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as I was this Morning. A little before, I had heard of a Child who was taken &s;ick ju&s;t after it had heard me preach, and &s;aid, He would go to Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s God; and died in a &s;hort Time. This encouraged me to &s;peak to the little Ones. But Oh, how were the old People affected when I &s;aid, Little Children, if your Pa|rents will not come to Chri&s;t, do you come and go to Heaven without them. There &s;eemed to be but few dry Eyes look where I would. The Word &s;mote them, I believe, through and through; and my own Soul was very much carried out. Surely it was the Lord's Pa&s;&s;over. I have not &s;een a greater Commotion &s;ince my preaching at <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> Glory be to God who has not forgotten to be gracious. At the &s;ame Time was collected <HI>l.</HI> 440. Went with the Governour, who &s;eemed more and more affected, in his Coach to my Lodgings.&mdash;Snatch'd a few Moments to write a Letter or two; gave a Word of Exhortation to a great Crowd of People, and then &s;lipped out privately at a back Door and went and &s;upped at a Man's Hou&s;e, who&s;e Wife and Si&s;ter, as well as him&s;elf, I tru&s;t

<P><HI>Thur&s;day, October</HI> 9. Have been applied to, this and every Morning &s;ince my return, by many Souls under deep Di&s;tre&s;s; and was only grieved that I could not have more Time with them. Preached this Morning the publick Lecture at Dr. <HI>Sewall'</HI>s Meeting-Hou&s;e, which was very much crowded. When I left my Lodgings, I had fixed on, and folded down a particular Text, but when I came near the Meeting-Hou&s;e I found it much impre&s;&s;ed upon my Heart, that I &s;hould preach up|on our Lord's Conference with <HI>Nicodemus:</HI> I ac|quainted a Friend with it. When I came into the Pulpit, I &s;aw a great Number of Mini&s;ters &s;itting around and before me, and when I came to tho&s;e Words, <HI>Art thou a Ma&s;ter of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>and knowe&s;t not the&s;e Things?</HI> The Lord enabled me to open my Mouth boldly again&s;t unconverted Mini&s;ters; to caution Tutors to take Care of their Pupils: And al&s;o to advi&s;e Mini&s;ters particularly to examine into the Experiences of Candidates for Ordination. For I am verily per&s;uaded the Generality of Preachers talk of an unknown unfelt Chri&s;t. And the Rea&s;on why Congregations have been &s;o dead, is becau&s;e they have had dead Men preaching to them. Oh that the Lord may quicken and revive them, for his own Names Sake. For how can dead Men beget liv|ing Children? It's true indeed, God may convert People by the Devil if he plea&s;es, and &s;o he may by unconverted Mini&s;ters. But I believe he &s;eldom makes U&s;e of either of them for this Purpo&s;e. No, the Lord will chu&s;e Ve&s;&s;els made meet by the

Operations of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit for his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> And as for my own Part, I wou'd not lay Hands on an unconverted Man for ten thou&s;and Worlds. Un&s;peakable Freedom God gave me while treating on this Head. After Sermon I dined with the Go|vernor, who &s;eemed more kindly affected than ever; and particularly told one of the Mini&s;ter's who had lately began to preach extempore, that he was very glad he had found out a Way to &s;ave his Eyes. Oh that others wou'd follow him; I believe they would find the Lord ready to help and a&s;&s;i&s;t them. In the Afternoon I preached in the Common to about 15000 People, and collected upwards of <HI>l.</HI> 200 for the Orphan-Hou&s;e. Ju&s;t as I had fini&s;hed my Sermon a Ticket was put up to me, wherein I was de&s;ired to pray for a Per&s;on ju&s;t enter'd upon the Mini&s;try; but under Apprehen&s;ions that he was not converted. God enabled me to pray for him with my whole Heart; and I hope that Ticket will teach many others not to run before they can give an Account of their Conver&s;ion: If they do, they offer God &s;trange Fire. Went to the Funeral of one belonging to the Council; but do not like the Cu&s;tom at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> of not &s;peaking at the Grave. When can Mini&s;ters Prayers and Ex|hortations be more &s;uitable, than when the Corps before will &s;ilently as it were a&s;&s;i&s;t them, and with a kind of dumb Oratory bid the Spectators con&s;ider their latter End. When the Funeral was over, I went as privately as po&s;&s;ible to the Alms-Hou&s;e and enlarged on the&s;e Words, <HI>The Poor receive the Go&s;pel;</HI> for near half an Hour. Then I went to the Work-Hou&s;e, where I prayed with and exhorted a great

Then hearing there was a con&s;iderable Number waiting for me at my Lodgings (tho' &s;ome cryed out, Spare thy &s;elf) God &s;trengthned me to go and give them a &s;piritual Mor&s;el; and then I went and eat Bread comfortably at a Friend's Hou&s;e, whi|ther I was invited, and &s;oon after retired to my Re&s;t. Oh how &s;weet Sleep is after working for Je&s;us. <HI>Lord, &s;trengthen me yet a little longer, and then let me &s;leep in thee, never to awake in this vain World again.

<P><HI>Friday, Octob.</HI> 10. Was &s;till bu&s;ied from the very Moment I ro&s;e, till I went out, in an&s;wering poor Souls that came to me under great Di&s;tre&s;s. About 9 went with Mr. <HI>Cooper</HI> over <HI>Charles-Town</HI> Ferry, here I preached with much De|mon&s;tration of the Spirit; and collected <HI>l.</HI> 156 for the Orphan-Hou&s;e. Then I dined at <HI>Medford,</HI> 4 Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> at the Hou&s;e of E&s;qr. <HI>Royal,</HI> a young rich Man, who has &s;eem'd much affected for &s;ome Time.

<P><HI>Saturday, October</HI> 11. Was but weak in Body, and perceived I had taken cold.&mdash;But preaching I find a con&s;tant Remedy again&s;t all &s;light Indi&s;po&s;itions. Went to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> 4 miles from <HI>Medford</HI> &amp; preach|ed at the Meeting-Hou&s;e Door, to a great Body of People, who &s;tood very attentively, tho' it rained, and were at the latter Part of the Sermon much affected. It being at the Univer&s;ity, I di&s;cour&s;ed on the&s;e Words&mdash;<HI>Noah the eighth Per&s;on a Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> And endeavoured to &s;hew the Qualifications proper for a true evangelical Preacher of Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s. The Lord opened my Mouth, and I &s;poke very plainly to Tutors and Pu|pils. <HI>l.</HI> 100 were collected for the Orphans. After Sermon the Pre&s;ident very kindly entertained me and my Friends. About 4 we reached <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> I preached immediately at Dr. <HI>Sewall'</HI>s Meeting-Hou&s;e, exhorted a great Company afterwards at my Lodgings, and then was employed till near Midnight in &s;ettling my private Affairs, an&s;wering Letters, and &s;peaking to Souls under Convictions. One little Girl came to me about eight Years old, under deep Convictions. She, as her Friends told
<PB N="74" REF="004848_0038_100E01D874B5AED0">
me, had been wre&s;tling for Chri&s;t: And whil&s;t &s;he was wre&s;tling it came to her mind, that Je&s;us being in an Agony, prayed yet &s;o much the more earne&s;tly; and that an Angel was &s;ent from Hea|ven to &s;trengthen him. This encouraged her to per&s;evere, and her Soul &s;oon received &s;ome Comfort. Another Mini&s;ter's little Daughter has been quite re&s;tle&s;s after Chri&s;t Night and Day. And a young Man about fourteen came to me crying, &s;aying, Sir, I am convicted, but not comforted, O pray for me. <HI>I thank thee holy Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e Things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and ha&s;t revealed them unto Babes: Even &s;o Father, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, October</HI> 12. Perceived I was much re|fre&s;h'd in Body and Soul when I ro&s;e in the Mor|ning. Spoke to as many as I could that came for &s;piritual Advice. Preach'd with great Power and Affection at Dr. <HI>Sewall'</HI>s Meeting-Hou&s;e, which was &s;o exceedingly thronged, that I was obliged to get in at one of the Windows. Dined with the Governour, who came to me after Dinner when I was retir'd; and weeping mo&s;t earne&s;tly, de&s;ired my Prayers. The Lord be with and in him for Time and Eternity. Went and heard Dr. <HI>Sewall</HI> preach in the Afternoon. Was &s;ick at Meeting, and al&s;o after it was over. Went with the Governour in his Coach, to the Common, where I preached my Farewel-Sermon to near 30,000 People. A Sight I have not &s;een &s;ince I left <HI>Black-Heath,</HI> &amp; a Sight perhaps never before &s;een in all <HI>America.</HI> It being du&s;ki&s;h before I had done, the Sight was more &s;o|lemn. Numbers, great Numbers melted into Tears

when I talked of leaving them. I was very parti|cular in my Application, both to Rulers, Mini&s;ters and People, commended what was commendable, and blamed what was blame-worthy, and exhorted them &s;teadily to imitate the Piety of their Fore-Fathers,&mdash;that whether I was pre&s;ent or whether I was ab&s;ent I might hear of their Affairs, that with one Heart and one Mind they were &s;triving together for the Faith of the Go&s;pel. After Ser|mon the Governour went with me to my Lodg|ings, I &s;tood in the Pa&s;&s;age and &s;poke to a great Company, both within and without the Doors.&mdash;But they were &s;o deeply affected and cried out &s;o loud, that I was obliged to leave off praying. The Governour was highly plea&s;ed to &s;ee the Power of God. He took his leave in the mo&s;t affectionate Manner, and &s;aid he would come and take me in his Coach to <HI>Charle&s;town</HI> Ferry the morrow Mor|ning. The remainder of the Evening was almo&s;t intirely taken up in &s;peaking to Souls deeply woun|ded by the Word. The poor Girl that followed me from <HI>Roxbury</HI> I believe had a &s;aving Di&s;covery of Je&s;us Chri&s;t this Morning.

Has the Form kept up very well; but has lo&s;t much of the Power of Religion. I have not heard of any remarkable Stir in it for the&s;e many Years. Mini&s;ters and People are obliged to con|fe&s;s, that the Love of many is waxed cold. Both for the generality &s;eem too much conformed to the World. There's much of the Pride of Life to be &s;een in their A&s;&s;emblies: Jewels, Patches, and gay Apparel are commonly worn by the female Sex; little Boys and Girls, I ob&s;erved commonly dre&s;&s;ed up in the Pride of Life; and the little In|fants that were brought to Bapti&s;m, were wrapped in &s;uch fine Things and &s;o much Pains taken to dre&s;s them, that one would think they were brought thither to be initiated into, rather than renounce the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World.&mdash;There are nine Meeting-Hou&s;es of the congregati|onal Per&s;ua&s;ion, one Bapti&s;t, one French, one be|longing to the Scotch-Iri&s;h, there are two monthly and one weekly Lecture, and that too but poorly at|tended; &s;everal Mini&s;ters complained to me of it, I mentioned it in my Sermons, and I tru&s;t God will &s;tir up the People more frequently to tread the Courts of the Lord's Hou&s;e. One Thing <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> is remarkable for,&mdash;The external Ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath; Men in civil Offices have a Regard for Religion: The Governour encourages them, and
<PB N="77" REF="004848_0039_100E01DAB7723E90">
the Mini&s;ters and Magi&s;trates &s;eem to be more uni|ted than in any other Place where I have been.&mdash;Both were exceeding civil to me during my Stay. I never &s;aw &s;o little &s;coffing;&mdash;Never had &s;o little Oppo&s;ition: But one might ea&s;ily fore&s;ee much would hereafter ari&s;e, when I come to be more particular in my Application to particular Per&s;ons; for I fear, many, many re&s;t in a Head-Knowledge, are clo&s;e Phari&s;ees, and having only a Name to live. It mu&s;t needs be &s;o when the Power of Godline&s;s is dwindled away, and the Form only of Religion is become fa&s;hionable among&s;t a People. However no doubt there are few a Names left in <HI>Sardis</HI> that have not defiled their Garments; many Letters came to me as far as I could judge from truly pious People, in which they heavily com|plained of the &s;ad Degeneracy of their Times, and hoped that God was now about to revive his Work in the mid&s;t o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Years. <HI>Even &s;o Lord Je&s;us, Amen and Amen, &s;ay I with my whole Heart.</HI> For <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> People are dear to my Soul.

<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Octob.</HI> 16. Ro&s;e in great Dejection of Soul, at the Con&s;ideration of indwelling Sin. Re|tired and wept before the Lord. Preach'd not with extraordinary Freedom at fir&s;t, but at la&s;t the Word ran and melted many down. After Dinner, was much enlarged again and &s;trengthened to wre&s;tle with God for a Revival of his Work in the&s;e Parts. Reached <HI>Cold-Spring,</HI> 15 Miles from <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> preach'd at the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>L</HI>&mdash;<HI>n,</HI> to three or four hundred People; but perceived little moving,

except for a few Minutes. Spent this Evening with my dear Fellow Travellers; was &s;omewhat ca&s;t down, but afterwards received Sweetne&s;s and Free|dom of Soul, by retiring and pouring out my Com|plaints and Petitions before the dear Lord Je&s;us. Oh the &s;overeignty and di&s;tingui&s;hing Freene&s;s of God's Grace. If it was not for the Con&s;ideration of that, my Soul mu&s;t be continually pierced thro' with many Sorrows. <HI>Lord, for thy Mercies Sake, &s;uffer me never to let this Con&s;ideration go.</HI> Amen, <HI>Lord Je&s;us.</HI> Amen.</P>

<P><HI>Friday, Octob.</HI> 17. Set out as &s;oon as it was Light and reach'd <HI>Hadley,</HI> a Place where a great Work of God was begun &s;ome few Years ago. But lately the People of God have complained of Deadne&s;s, and lo&s;ing their fir&s;t Love. However, as &s;oon as I mentioned what God had done for their Souls for|merly, it was like putting Fire to Tinder. The Remembrance of it quicken'd them, cau&s;ed many of them to weep &s;orely. When I had taken a lit|tle Refre&s;hment, we cro&s;&s;ed the Ferry to <HI>Nor|thampton,</HI> where no le&s;s than 300 Souls as was &s;up|po&s;ed, were &s;avingly brought home to the dear Lord Je&s;us about 5 or 6 Years ago.

And when I came to remind them of their former Ex|periences, and how zealous and lively they were at that Time, both Mini&s;ter and People wept much, and the Holy Gho&s;t enabled me to &s;peak with a great deal of Power. In the Evening I gave a Word of Exhortation to &s;everal that came to Mr. <HI>Edwards'</HI>s Hou&s;e, my Body was &s;omewhat weak, my Appetite almo&s;t gone, but my Lord, gave me Meat to eat which the World knows nothing of. <HI>Lord evermore give me this Bread.</HI> Amen and Amen.</P>

<P><HI>Sunday, October</HI> 19. Felt wonderful Satisfaction in being at the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Edwards.</HI> He is a Son him&s;elf, and hath al&s;o a Daughter of <HI>Abraham</HI> for his Wife. A &s;weeter Couple I have not yet &s;een.

She is a Woman adorned with a meek and quiet Spirit, and talked &s;o feelingly and &s;olidly of the Things of God, and &s;eemed to be &s;uch a Helpmeet for her Hu&s;band, that &s;he cau&s;ed me to renew tho&s;e Prayers, which for &s;ome Months I have put up to God, that he would be plea&s;ed to &s;end me a Daugh|ter of <HI>Abraham</HI> to be my Wife.

<P><HI>Monday, Octob.</HI> 20. Left <HI>Northampton</HI> in the Evening, rode very plea&s;antly 18 Miles to <HI>We&s;tfield,</HI> conver&s;ed with a poor Woman on her &s;ick Bed, who gave me an Account of &s;ome Di&s;coveries &s;he had of our Lord's redeeming Love. Met with a little Book written by Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> entitled, <HI>Orna|ments for the Daughters of Zion:</HI> which I would re|commend to all, e&s;pecially the <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Ladies. Preach|ed in the Morning to a con&s;iderable Congregation, and with con&s;iderable Power at the latter End. Ha|&s;ted to <HI>Springfield,</HI> about ten Miles from <HI>We&s;tfield,</HI> cro&s;&s;ed a Ferry, preach'd to a large Auditory; and then returned and preach'd in the Evening by Can|dle Light to tho&s;e who could not get over the Ferry by Rea&s;on of the Wind. The Meeting-Hou&s;e was full. God's Power was with me both Times, e&s;pe|cially at the la&s;t. My Soul was much carried out in Prayer, and the Lord &s;o &s;trenghthen'd me in the inner Man, that I could have preach'd another Ser|mon after I had done. A little after I left <HI>Spring|field,</HI> my Hor&s;e coming over a Bridge, threw me over his Head directly upon my No&s;e: The Fall &s;tun'd me for a while; my Mouth was full of Du&s;t: I bled

<P><HI>Tue&s;day, October</HI> 21. Set out for <HI>Suffield</HI> about eight Miles from the Place where I lay; reached thither and preached about 11 o'Clock to &s;everal Thou&s;ands of People; met with a Mini&s;ter on the Way, who &s;aid it was not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for a Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ter that he &s;hould be converted. I in&s;i&s;ted much in my Di&s;cour&s;e, upon the Doctrine of the New-Birth, and al&s;o the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Mini&s;ter's being converted before he could preach Chri&s;t a|right.&mdash;The Word came with great Power, and a great Impre&s;&s;ion was made upon the People in all Parts of the A&s;&s;embly; many Mini&s;ters were pre|&s;ent, I did not &s;pare them,&mdash;mo&s;t of them than|ked me for my plain Dealing.

Mini&s;ters are the Bane of the Chri&s;tian Church; and tho' I honour the Memory of that great and good Man, Mr. <HI>Stoddard,</HI> yet I think he is much to be blamed for endeavouring to prove that uncon|verted Men might be admitted into the Mini&s;try. How he has handled the Controver&s;y, I know not. I think no &s;olid Arguments can be brought to de|fend &s;uch a Cau&s;e.&mdash;But the be&s;t of Men are per|mitted to err, that we may know they were but Men. A Sermon lately publi&s;hed by Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent,</HI> entitled, <HI>The Danger of an unconverted Mini&s;try,</HI> I think unan&s;werable. As I was riding to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> after Dinner, an old Man came up to me &s;aying, He knew what I had preached in the Morning was true,&mdash;I have felt it, &s;ays he, I was under the Spirit of Bondage twenty Years, and have received the Spirit of Adoption 23 Years. Another came giving me an Account of his Expe|riences, and the People of God &s;eemed much revi|ved at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> where I am informed a true con|verted Man is the Mini&s;ter. I preached in the Af|ternoon and with &s;uch Freedom, that a young Mi|ni&s;ter who had heard me &s;everal Times, told me, I had kept the good Wine until now. As &s;oon as Sermon was over, I rode about a Mile, cro&s;&s;ed a broad Ferry, walked about a Mile &amp; half, &amp; prea|ched to a thronged Congregation, belonging to old Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> Father to Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> of <HI>Northamp|ton,</HI> and I believe a true Di&s;ciple of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. My Body being &s;omething weak, I did not &s;peak with that Strength as la&s;t Night, neither was I &s;o much a&s;&s;i&s;ted; but it is the Lord, he knows be&s;t when to di&s;pen&s;e, and when to &s;u&s;pend his Aids.

After Exerci&s;e I &s;upped at the Hou&s;e of old Mr. <HI>Ed|wards;</HI> his Wife was as aged, I believe, as him&s;elf, and if &s;he was converted, (and I know nothing to the contrary) I fancied I was &s;itting in the Hou&s;e of a <HI>Zachary</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> Indeed I felt great Sa|tisfaction in my own Soul, and parted from him and his Son (who came with me &s;o far) with &s;ome in|ward Regret.

In the Afternoon at <HI>Norwalk,</HI> 12 miles from <HI>Fairfield,</HI> I was re&s;trained much both in Prayer and Preaching. It rained much, &s;o that we had not a large Congre|gation; However, &s;ome &s;ay I ob&s;erved were af|fected. I believe my Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ver lets me preach in vain. <HI>Grant this O Lord for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> own Names Sake.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, Octob.</HI> 29. Came hither la&s;t Night in Safety, tho' it was very dark and rainy. Was vi|&s;ited with a great inward Trial, &s;o that I was pained to the Heart. Was &s;omewhat dejected before I went out of my Lodgings, and &s;omewhat di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for a Text after I got up into the Pulpit. But the Lord at length directed me to one, but I looked for no Power or Succe&s;s, being very low by my la&s;t Night's Trial; notwith&s;tanding, before I had preach'd half an Hour, the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit began to move on the Hearers Hearts in a very awful manner. Young, and e&s;pecially many old People were &s;ur|prizingly affected, &s;o that I tho't they would have cried out. At Dinner the Spirit of the Lord came upon me again, and enabled me to &s;peak with &s;uch Vigour again&s;t &s;ending unconverted Per&s;ons into the Mini&s;try, that two Mini&s;ters, with Tears in their Eyes, publickly confe&s;&s;ed, they had laid Hands on young

Men without &s;o much as a&s;king them, <HI>Whether they were born again of God or not?</HI> After Dinner, find|ing my Heart much enlarged, I prayed, and with &s;uch Power, that mo&s;t in the Room were put under Concern. And one old Mini&s;ter was &s;o deeply con|victed, that calling Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> and me out, with great difficulty (becau&s;e of his weeping) He de&s;ired our Prayers. <HI>For,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I have been a Scholar, and have preached the Doctrines of Grace for a long Time, but I believe I never have felt the Power of them in my own Soul.</HI> O that all unconverted Mi|ni&s;ters were bro't to make the &s;ame Confe&s;&s;ion. I was much affected with his Ingenuity, and after having by Prayer earne&s;tly recommended him to God, I took Hor&s;e, rejoicing exceedingly in Spi|rit, to &s;ee how our Lord was getting him&s;elf the Victory in a Place where Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> a Native of <HI>Stanford,</HI> and dear Mini&s;ter of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, had been &s;lighted &amp; de&s;pi&s;ed. <HI>A Prophet is not without Honour, &s;ave in his own Country &amp; his Father's Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But here I think it proper to &s;et up my <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> and before I enter into the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> to give God Thanks for &s;ending me into <HI>New-Eng|land.</HI> I have now had an Opportunity of &s;eeing the greate&s;t and the mo&s;t populous Parts of it, &amp; take all together, it certainly on many Accounts exceeds all other Provinces in <HI>America,</HI> &amp; for the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment of Religion, perhaps all other Parts of the World. Never &s;urely was &s;o large a Spot of Ground &s;etled in &s;uch a Manner, in &s;o &s;hort a Space as one hun|dred Years. The Towns thro' <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and Ea&s;tward towards <HI>York,</HI> in the Province of the <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> near the River Side are large, and well peopled, and exceeding plea&s;ant to travel thro'.</P>

Every five or ten miles you have a Meeting-Hou&s;e, and I believe there's no &s;uch Thing as a Plurali&s;t or non-re&s;ident Mini&s;ter in both Provinces. Many, nay perhaps mo&s;t that preach, I fear, do not expe|rimentally know Chri&s;t, yet I cannot &s;ee much worldly Advantage to tempt them to take upon them the &s;acred Function. Few Country-Mini&s;ters as I have been informed, have &s;ufficient allowed them in Money to maintain a Family. God has remarkably in &s;undry Times, &amp; in divers manners, poured out his Spirit in &s;everal Parts of both Provinces, &amp; it often re|fre&s;hes my Soul, to hear of the Faith of the good Fore|fathers who fir&s;t &s;etled in the&s;e Parts; notwith&s;tand|ing they had their Foibles, &s;urely they were a Set of righteous Men: They certainly followed our Lord's Rule, <HI>&s;ought fir&s;t the Kingdom of God and his Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and behold all other Things God added unto them: Their Seed are now ble&s;&s;ed in temporal Things e&s;pecially, &amp; notwith&s;tanding the ri&s;ing Ge|neration &s;eem to be &s;etled on their Lees, yet I be|lieve the <HI>Lord hath left more than &s;even thou&s;and who have not bowed their Knee to Baal.</HI> The Mini&s;ters and People of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> &s;eemed to be more &s;im|ple and &s;erious than tho&s;e that live near <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> e&s;pe|cially in tho&s;e Parts where I went. But I think the Mini&s;ters preaching almo&s;t univer&s;ally by Notes, is a certain mark they have in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t the old Spirit of Preaching.&mdash;For tho' all are not to be condemned that u&s;e Notes, yet it is a &s;ad Symp|tom of the Decay of vital Religion, when reading Sermons becomes fa&s;hionable, where <HI>extempore</HI> preaching did once almo&s;t univer&s;ally prevail: When the Spirit of Prayer began to be lo&s;t, then Forms of Prayer were invented, and I believe the &s;ame

Ob&s;ervation will hold good as to preaching. As for the Univer&s;ities I believe it may be &s;aid, <HI>Their Light is now become Darkne&s;s,</HI>&mdash;<HI>Darkne&s;s that may be felt;</HI> and is complained of by the mo&s;t godly Mini|&s;ters. I pray God tho&s;e Fountains may be purifi|ed, and &s;end forth pure Streams to water the City of our God. The Church of <HI>England</HI> is at a very low Ebb, and as far as I can find, had People kept their primitive Purity, it would &s;carce have got foot|ing in <HI>New-England.</HI> I have many Evidences to prove that mo&s;t of the Churches have been fir&s;t &s;et up by immoral Men, and &s;uch as would not &s;ubmit to the Di&s;cipline of their Congregations, or were corrupt in the Faith.&mdash;But I will &s;ay no more a|bout the poor Church of <HI>England.</HI>&mdash;Mo&s;t of her Sons, whither Mini&s;ters or People, I fear hate to be reformed. As for the civil Government of <HI>New-England,</HI> it &s;eems to be well regulated, and I think at opening all their Courts, either the Judge or a Mini&s;ter begins with a Prayer. Family Wor|&s;hip is I believe generally kept up. The Negroes I think are better u&s;ed in re&s;pect both to Soul and Body, than in any other Province I have yet &s;een. In &s;hort, I like <HI>New-England</HI> exceeding well, and when a Spirit of Reformation revives, it certainly will prevail more than in other Places, becau&s;e they are more &s;imple in their Wor&s;hip, le&s;s corrupt in their Principles, and con&s;equently more ea&s;ily brought over to the Form of &s;ound Words, into which &s;o many of their pious Ance&s;tors were delivered. <HI>Send forth, O Lord, thy Light and thy Truth, and for thy infinite Mercies Sake, &s;hew thou ha&s;t a peculiar Delight in the&s;e habitable Parts of the Earth.</HI> Amen, Lord Je&s;us, AMEN.</P>
