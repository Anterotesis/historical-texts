<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>MY life has for &s;everal years been a theatre of calamity. I have been a mark for the vigilance of tyranny, and I could not e&s;cape. My faire&s;t pro&s;|pects have been bla&s;ted. My enemy has &s;hown him&s;elf inacce&s;&s;ible to intreaties and untired in per&s;ecution. My fame, as well as my happine&s;s, has become his victim. Every one, as far as my &s;tory has been known, has refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in my di&s;tre&s;s, and has execrated my name. I have not de&s;erved this treatment. My own con&s;cience witne&s;&s;es in behalf of that innocence my preten&s;ions
<PB N="2" REF="028752_0004_0FDBEF4938E29388">
to which are regarded in the world as incredible. There is now however little hope that I &s;hall e&s;cape from the toils that univer&s;ally be&s;et me. I am in|cited to the penning of the&s;e memoirs, only by a de&s;ire to divert my mind from the deplorablene&s;s of my &s;ituation, and a faint idea that po&s;terity may by their means be induced to render me a ju&s;tice which my contemporaries refu&s;e. My &s;tory will at lea&s;t appear to have that con&s;i&s;tency, which is &s;eldom attendant but upon truth.</P>
<P>I was born of humble parents in a remote coun|ty of England. Their occupations were &s;uch as u&s;ually fall to the lot of pea&s;ants, and they had no portion to give me but an education free from the u&s;ual &s;ources of depravity, and the inheritance, long &s;ince lo&s;t by their unfortunate progeny! of an hone&s;t fame. I was taught the rudiments of no &s;cience, except reading, writing and arithmetic. But I had an inqui&s;itive mind, and neglected no means of information from conver&s;ation or books. My improvement was greater than my condition in life afforded room to expect.</P>
<P>Our re&s;idence was within the manor of Fer|dinando Falkland, a country &s;quire of con&s;iderable opulence. At an early age I attracted the favour|able notice of Mr. Collins, this gentleman's &s;teward, who u&s;ed to call in occa&s;ionally at my father's. He ob&s;erved the particulars of my progre&s;s with approbation, and made a favourable report to his ma&s;ter of my indu&s;try and genius.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of the year <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. Falk|land vi&s;ited his e&s;tate in our county after an ab&s;ence of &s;everal months. This was a period of misfor|tune to me. I was then eighteen years of age. My father lay dead in our cottage. I had lo&s;t my mother &s;ome years before. In this forlorn &s;ituation I was &s;urpri&s;ed with a me&s;&s;age from the &s;quire,
<PB N="3" REF="028752_0005_0FDEB4598DB10528">
ordering me to repair to the man&s;ion-hou&s;e the morning after my father's funeral.</P>
<P>Though I was not a &s;tranger to books, I had no practical acquaintance with men. I had never had occa&s;ion to addre&s;s a per&s;on of this elevated rank, and I felt no &s;mall unea&s;ine&s;s and awe on the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion. I found Mr Falkland a man of &s;mall &s;tature, with an extreme <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of form and appearance. In place of the hard-favoured and inflexible vi&s;ages I had been accu&s;tomed to ob|&s;erve, every mu&s;cle and petty line of his coun|tenance &s;eemed to be in an inconceivable degree pregnant with meaning. His manner was kind, attentive and humane. His eye was full of ani|mation, but there was a grave and &s;ad &s;olemnity in his air, which for want of experience I imagined was the inheritance of the great, and the in&s;tru|ment by which the di&s;tance between them and their inferiors was maintained. His look be&s;poke the unquietne&s;s of his mind, and frequently wan|dered with an expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;con&s;olatene&s;s and anxiety.</P>
<P>My reception was as gracious and encouraging as I could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire. Mr. Falkland que&s;tioned me re&s;pecting my learning, and my conceptions of men and things, and li&s;tened to my an&s;wers with conde&s;cen&s;ion and approbation. This kindne&s;s &s;oon re&s;tored to me a con&s;iderable part of my&s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, though I &s;till felt re&s;trained by the graceful, but unaltered dignity of his carriage. I have already &s;aid that I was not unacquainted with books. I had not failed to derive advantage from the opportunities which offered them&s;elves, and &s;ome of tho&s;e opportunities were of very for|tunate occurrence. But it is not my purpo&s;e to draw out this narrative by unnece&s;&s;ary detail; I leave the reader to collect what my acqui&s;itions had been from the incidents which followed. When
<PB N="4" REF="028752_0006_0FDBEF4C79362DE0">
Mr. Falkland had &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied his curio&s;ity, he proceeded to inform me that he was in want of a &s;ecretary, that I appeared to him &s;ufficiently qualified for that office, and that, if in my pre&s;ent change of &s;ituation occa&s;ioned by the death of my father I approved of the employment, he would take me into his family.</P>
<P>I felt highly flattered by the propo&s;al, and was warm in the expre&s;&s;ion of my acknowledgements. I &s;et eagerly about the di&s;po&s;al of the little property my father had left, in which I was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mr. Collins. I had not now a relation, upon who&s;e kindne&s;s and interpo&s;ition I had any direct claim, in the world. But far from regarding this de&s;erted &s;ituation with terror, I formed golden vi&s;ions of the &s;tation I was about to occupy. I little &s;u&s;pected that the gaiety and lightne&s;s of heart I had hitherto enjoyed were upon the point of leaving me for ever, and that the re&s;t of my days were devoted to mi&s;ery and alarm.</P>
<P>My employment was ea&s;y and agreeable. It con&s;i&s;ted partly of the tran&s;cribing and arranging certain papers, and partly of writing from my ma&s;ter's dictation letters of bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as &s;ketches of literary compo&s;ition. Many of the&s;e latter con&s;i&s;ted of an analytical &s;urvey of the plans of different authors, and conjectural &s;peculations upon hints they afforded, tending either to the de|tection of their errors or the carrying forward their di&s;coveries. All of them bore powerful marks of a profound and elegant under&s;tanding, well &s;tored with literature, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an uncommon &s;hare of activity and di&s;crimination.</P>
<P>My &s;tation was in that part of the hou&s;e which was appropriated for the reception of books, it be|ing my duty to perform the functions of librarian as well as &s;ecretary. Here my hours would have glided in tranquillity and peace, had not my &s;itua|tion
<PB N="5" REF="028752_0007_0FDEB433B683E308">
included in it circum&s;tances totally different from tho&s;e which attended me in my father's cot|tage. In early life my mind had been almo&s;t wholly engro&s;&s;ed by reading and reflexion. My intercour&s;es with my fellow mortals were occa&s;ional and &s;hort. But in my new re&s;idence I was excited by every motive of intere&s;t and curio&s;ity to &s;tudy my ma&s;ter's character, and I found in it an am|ple field for &s;peculation and conjecture.</P>
<P>His mode of living was in the utmo&s;t degree reclu&s;e and &s;olitary. He had no inclination to &s;cenes of revelry and mirth. He avoided the bu&s;y haunts of men; nor did he &s;eem de&s;irous to com|pen&s;ate for this privation by the confidence of friend&s;hip. He appeared a total &s;tranger to every thing which u&s;ually bears the appellation of plea|&s;ure. His features were &s;carcely ever relaxed into a &s;mile, nor did that air which be&s;poke the unhap|pine&s;s of his mind, at any time for&s;ake them. Yet his manners were by no means &s;uch as denoted moro&s;ene&s;s and mi&s;anthropy. He was compa&s;|&s;ionate and con&s;iderate for others, though the &s;tate|line&s;s of his carriage and the re&s;erve of his temper were at no time interrupted. His appearance and general behaviour might have &s;trongly intere&s;ted all per&s;ons in his favour; but the coldne&s;s of his addre&s;s and the impenetrablene&s;s of his &s;entiments &s;eemed to forbid tho&s;e demon&s;trations of kind|ne&s;s to which one might otherwi&s;e have been prompted.</P>
<P>Such was the general appearance of Mr. Falk|land; but his temper was extremely unequal. The di&s;temper which afflicted him with ince&s;&s;ant gloom, had its paroxy&s;ms. Sometimes he was ha&s;ty, peevi&s;h and tyrannical; but this proceeded rather from the torment of his mind than an unfeeling di&s;po&s;ition, and, when reflexion recurred, he ap|peared willing that the weight of his misfortune
<PB N="6" REF="028752_0008_0FDBEF4E5372D220">
&s;hould fall wholly upon him&s;elf. Sometimes he entirely lo&s;t his &s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and his behaviour was changed into frenzy. He would &s;trike his forehead, his brows became knit, his features di&s;|torted, and his teeth ground one again&s;t the other. When he felt the approach of the&s;e &s;ymptoms, he would &s;uddenly ri&s;e, and, leaving the occupation whatever it was in which he was engaged, ha&s;ten into a &s;olitude upon which no per&s;on dared to in|trude.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed that the whole of what I am de&s;cribing was vi&s;ible to the per&s;ons about him; nor indeed was I acquainted with it in the extent here &s;tated, but after a con&s;iderable time, and in gradual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. With re&s;pect to the dome&s;tics in general, they &s;aw but little of their ma&s;ter. None of them, except my&s;elf from the nature of my functions, and Mr. Collins from the antiquity of his &s;ervice and the re&s;pectablene&s;s of his character, approached Mr. Falkland, but at &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons and for a very &s;hort interval. They knew him only by the benevolence of his actions and the principles of inflexible integrity by which he was ordinarily guided; and, though they would &s;ometimes indulge their conjectures re&s;pecting his &s;ingularities, regarded him upon the whole with veneration as a being of a &s;uperior order.</P>
<P>One day when I had been about three months in the &s;ervice of my patron, I went into a clo&s;et or &s;mall apartment which was &s;eparated from the library by a narrow gallery that was lighted by a &s;mall window near the roof. I had conceived that there was no per&s;on in the room, and went only to put any thing in order that I might find out of its place. As I opened the door, I heard at the &s;ame in&s;tant a deep groan expre&s;&s;ive of intolerable an|gui&s;h. The &s;ound of the door in opening &s;eemed to alarm the per&s;on within; I heard the lid of a
<PB N="7" REF="028752_0009_0FDEB4353B01BA68">
che&s;t ha&s;tily &s;hut, and the noi&s;e as of fa&s;tening a lock. I immediately conceived that Mr. Falkland was there, and was going ha&s;tily to retire; but at that moment a voice that &s;eemed &s;upernaturally tremendous exclaimed, Who is there? The voice was Mr. Falkland's. The &s;ound of it thrilled my very vitals. I endeavoured to an&s;wer, but my &s;peech failed, and being incapable of any other reply, I in&s;tinctively advanced within the door into the room. Mr. Falkland was ju&s;t ri&s;en from the floor upon which he had been &s;itting or kneeling. His countenance betrayed &s;trong &s;ymptoms of con|fu&s;ion. With a violent effort however the&s;e &s;ymp|toms &s;uddenly vani&s;hed, and in&s;tantaneou&s;ly gave place to a countenance &s;parkling with rage. Vil|lain, cried he, what has brought you here? I he|&s;itated a confu&s;ed and irre&s;olute an&s;wer. Wretch, interrupted Mr. Falkland with uncontrolable im|patience, you want to ruin me. You &s;et your&s;elf as a &s;py upon my actions. But bitterly &s;hall you repent your in&s;olence. Do you think you &s;hall watch my privacies with impunity? I attempted to defend my&s;elf. Begone, devil! rejoined he. Quit the room, or I will trample you into atoms. Saying this, he advanced towards me. But I was already &s;ufficiently terrified, and vani&s;hed in a mo|ment. I heard the door &s;hut after me with vio|lence, and thus ended this extraordinary &s;cene.</P>
<P>I &s;aw him again in the evening, and he was then tolerably compo&s;ed. His behaviour, which was always kind, was now doubly attentive and &s;ooth|ing. He &s;eemed to have &s;omething of which he wi&s;hed to di&s;burthen his mind, but to want words in which to convey it. I looked at him with anx|iety and affection. He made two un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts, &s;hook his head, and then, putting five guineas into my hand, pre&s;&s;ed it in a manner that I could feel proceeded from a mind pregnant with
<PB N="8" REF="028752_0010_0FDBEF53206B6C58">
various emotions, though I could not interpret them. Having done this, he &s;eemed immediately to recollect him&s;elf, and to take refuge in the u&s;ual di&s;tance and &s;olemnity of his manner.</P>
<P>I ea&s;ily under&s;tood that &s;ecrecy was one of the things expected from me, and indeed my mind was too much di&s;po&s;ed to meditate upon what I had heard and &s;een, to make it a topic of indi&s;cri|minate communication. Mr. Collins however and my&s;elf happened to &s;up together that evening, which was but &s;eldom the ca&s;e, his avocations obliging him to be much abroad. He could not help ob&s;erving an uncommon dejection and anxiety in my countenance, and affectionately enquired into the rea&s;on. I endeavoured to evade his que&s;|tions, but my youth and ignorance of the world gave me but little advantage for that purpo&s;e. Be&s;ide this, I had been accu&s;tomed to view Mr. Collins with con&s;iderable attachment, and I con|ceived from the nature of his &s;ituation that there could be but &s;mall impropriety in making him my confident in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. I repeated to him minutely every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed, and con|cluded with a &s;olemn declaration that, though treated with caprice, I was not anxious for my|&s;elf: no inconvenience or danger to my&s;elf &s;hould ever lead me to a pu&s;illanimous behaviour; and I felt only for my ma&s;ter, who, with every advan|tage for happine&s;s, and being in the highe&s;t degree worthy of it, &s;eemed fated to undergo unmerited di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to my communication Mr. Collins in|formed me that &s;ome incidents of a nature &s;imilar to that which I related had fallen under his own knowledge, and that from the whole he could not help concluding that our unfortunate patron was at times di&s;ordered in his intellects. Alas, continued he, it was not always thus! Ferdinando
<PB N="9" REF="028752_0011_0FDEB43A98E34EB0">
Falkland was once the gaye&s;t of the gay. Not in|deed of that frothy &s;ort, who excite contempt in|&s;tead of admiration, and who&s;e levity argues thoughtle&s;sne&s;s rather than felicity. His gaiety was always accompanied with dignity. It was cha&s;tened with reflexion and &s;en&s;ibility, and never lo&s;t &s;ight either of good ta&s;te or humanity. Such as it was however, it denoted a genuine hilarity of heart, gave an inconceivable brilliancy to his com|pany and conver&s;ation, and rendered him the per|petual delight of the diver&s;ified circles he then wil|lingly frequented. You &s;ee nothing of him, my dear Williams, but the ruin of that Falkland, who was courted by &s;ages, and adored by the fair. His youth, di&s;tingui&s;hed in its out&s;et by the mo&s;t ge|nerous promi&s;e, is tarni&s;hed. His &s;en&s;ibility is &s;hrunk up and withered by events the mo&s;t di&s;|gu&s;tful to his feelings. His mind was fraught with all the rhap&s;odies of vi&s;ionary honour; and in his &s;en&s;e nothing but the gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er part, the mere &s;hell of Falkland, was capable to &s;urvive the wound that his pride has &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflexions of my friend Collins &s;trongly tended to inflame my curio&s;ity, and I reque&s;ted him to enter into a more copious explanation. With this reque&s;t he readily complied; as con|ceiving that whatever delicacy it became him to exerci&s;e in ordinary ca&s;es, it would be out of place in my &s;ituation, and thinking it not improbable that Mr. Falkland, but for the di&s;turbance and in|flammation of his mind, would be di&s;po&s;ed to a &s;imilar communication. I &s;hall join to Mr. Col|lins's &s;tory various information which I afterwards received from other quarters, that I may give all po&s;&s;ible per&s;picuity to the &s;eries of events. To the reader it may appear at fir&s;t &s;ight as if this detail of the preceding life of Mr. Falkland were foreign to my hi&s;tory. Alas, I know from bitter experi|ence
<PB N="10" REF="028752_0012_0FDBEF5455C48A50">
that it is otherwi&s;e. My heart bleeds at the recollection of his misfortunes as if they were my own. How can it fail to do &s;o? To his &s;tory the whole fortune of my life was linked; becau&s;e he was mi&s;erable, my happine&s;s, my name, and my exi&s;tence have been irretrievably bla&s;ted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the favourite authors of his early years were the heroic poets of Italy. From them he imbibed the love of chivalry and romance. He had too much good &s;en&s;e to regret the times of Charlemagne and Arthur. But, while his imagi|nation was purged by a certain infu&s;ion of philo|&s;ophy, he conceived that there was in the manners depicted by the&s;e celebrated poets, &s;omething to imitate, as well as &s;omething to avoid. He be|lieved that nothing was &s;o well calculated to make men delicate, gallant and humane, as a temper perpetually alive to the &s;entiments of birth and honour. The opinions he entertained upon tho&s;e topics were illu&s;trated in his conduct, which was a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly conformed to the model of heroi&s;m that his fancy &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;entiments he &s;et out upon his tra|vels at the age at which the grand tour is u&s;ually made, and they were rather confirmed than &s;haken by the adventures that be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">el him. By inclination he was led to make his longe&s;t &s;tay in Italy, and here he fell into company with &s;everal young no|blemen who&s;e &s;tudies and principles were congenial to his own. By them he was a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly courted and treated with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed applau&s;e. They were delighted to meet with a foreigner who had imbibed all the peculiarities of the mo&s;t liberal and honourable among them&s;elves. Nor was he le&s;s favoured and admired by the &s;ofter &s;ex. Though his &s;tature were &s;mall, his per&s;on had an air of uncommon dignity. His dignity was then
<PB N="12" REF="028752_0014_0FDBEF5A6EABCCB8">
heightened by certain additions which were after|wards obliterated, an expre&s;&s;ion of frankne&s;s, in|genuity and unre&s;erve, and a &s;pirit of the mo&s;t ardent enthu&s;ia&s;m. Perhaps no Engli&s;hman was ever in an equal degree idoli&s;ed by the inhabitants of Italy.</P>
<P>It was not po&s;&s;ible for him to have drank &s;o deeply of the fountain of chivalry without being engaged occa&s;ionally in affairs of honour, all of which were terminated in a manner that would not have di&s;graced the chevalier Bayard him&s;elf. In Italy the young men of rank divide them&s;elves into two cla&s;&s;es, tho&s;e who adhere to the pure principles of ancient gallantry, and tho&s;e who, being actuated by the &s;ame acute &s;en&s;e of injury and in&s;ult, accu&s;tom them&s;elves to the employment of hired bravoes as their in&s;truments of vengeance. The whole difference indeed con&s;i&s;ts in the preca|rious application of a generally received di&s;tinc|tion. The mo&s;t generous Italian &s;till conceives that there are certain per&s;ons whom it would be contamination to call into the open field. He ne|verthele&s;s believes that an indignity cannot be expi|ated but with blood, and is per&s;uaded that the life of a fellow creature is a very trifling con&s;ideration in compari&s;on with the indemnification to be made to his injured honour. There is therefore &s;carcely any Italian that would upon &s;ome occa&s;ions &s;cruple a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. Men of &s;pirit among them, not|with&s;tanding the prejudices of their education, cannot fail to have a &s;ecret conviction of its ba&s;e|ne&s;s, and will be de&s;irous of extending as far as po&s;&s;ible the cartel of honour. Real or affected arrogance teaches others to regard almo&s;t the whole human &s;pecies as their inferiors, and of con&s;e|quence incites them to gratify their vengeance without danger to their per&s;ons. Mr. Falkland fell in with &s;ome of the&s;e. But his undaunted &s;pirit
<PB N="13" REF="028752_0015_0FDEB4409DC18208">
and re&s;olute temper gave him a deci&s;ive advantage even in &s;uch perilous rencounters. One in&s;tance among many of his manner of conducting him|&s;elf among this proud and high-&s;pirited people, it may be proper to relate. Mr. Falkland is the principal agent in my hi&s;tory; and Mr. Falkland, in the autumn and decay of his vigour &s;uch as I found him, cannot be completely under&s;tood with|out a knowledge of his previous character as it was in all the glo&s;s of youth, yet una&s;&s;ailed by ad|ver&s;ity, and unbroken in upon by angui&s;h or re|mor&s;e.</P>
<P>At Rome he was received with particular di&s;|tinction at the hou&s;e of marquis Pi&s;ani, who had an only daughter, the heir of his immen&s;e fortune, and the admiration of all the young nobility of that metropolis. Lady Lucretia Pi&s;ani was tall, of a dignified form and uncommonly beautiful. She was not deficient in amiable qualities, but her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oul was haughty, and her carriage not unfre|quently contemptuous. Her pride was nouri&s;hed by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her charms, by her ele|vated rank and the univer&s;al adoration &s;he was accu&s;tomed to receive.</P>
<P>Among her numerous lovers count Malve&s;i was the individual mo&s;t favoured by her father, nor did his addre&s;&s;es &s;eem indifferent to her. The count was a man of con&s;iderable accompli&s;hments, and of great integrity and benevolence of di&s;po|&s;ition. But he was too ardent a lover to be able always to pre&s;erve the affability of his temper. The admirers, who&s;e addre&s;&s;es were a &s;ource of gratification to his mi&s;tre&s;s, were a perpetual tor|ment to him. Placing his whole happine&s;s in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this imperious beauty, the mo&s;t trifling circum&s;tances were capable of alarming him for the &s;ecurity of his preten&s;ions. But mo&s;t of all he was jealous of the Engli&s;h cavalier. The marquis

Pi&s;ani, who had &s;pent many years in France, was by no means partial to the &s;u&s;picious precautions of Italian fathers, and indulged his daughter in con&s;iderable freedoms. His hou&s;e and his daugh|ter, within certain judicious re&s;traints, were open to the re&s;ort of male vi&s;itants. But above all Mr. Falkland, as a foreigner, and a per&s;on little likely to form preten&s;ions to the hand of Lucretia, was received upon a footing of great familiarity. The lady her&s;elf, con&s;cious of her innocence, enter|tained no &s;cruple about trifles, and acted with the confidence and frankne&s;s of one who is &s;uperior to &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland, after a re&s;idence of &s;everal weeks at Rome, proceeded to Naples. Mean while cer|tain incidents occurred that delayed the intended nuptials of the heire&s;s of Pi&s;ani. When he re|turned to Rome count Malve&s;i was ab&s;ent. Lady Lucretia, who had been con&s;iderably amu&s;ed before with the conver&s;ation of Mr. Falkland, and who had an active and enquiring mind, had conceived in the interval between his fir&s;t and &s;econd re&s;idence at Rome a pa&s;&s;ion for learning the Engli&s;h lan|guage, in&s;pired by the lively and ardent encomi|ums of our be&s;t authors that &s;he had heard from their countryman. She had provided her&s;elf with the u&s;ual implements for that purpo&s;e, and made &s;ome progre&s;s during his ab&s;ence. But upon his return &s;he was de&s;irous of making u&s;e of the op|portunity which, if mi&s;&s;ed, might never occur again with equal advantages, of reading &s;elect pa&s;&s;ages of our poets in company with an Engli&s;h|man of uncommon ta&s;te and capacity.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al nece&s;&s;arily led to a more frequent intercour&s;e. When count Malve&s;i returned, he found Mr. Falkland e&s;tabli&s;hed almo&s;t as an inmate of the Pi&s;ani palace. His mind could not fail to be &s;truck with the criticalne&s;s of the &s;ituation. He
<PB N="15" REF="028752_0017_0FDEB442212C33E8">
was perhaps &s;ecretly con&s;cious that the qualifica|tions of the Engli&s;hman were &s;uperior to his own, and he trembled for the progre&s;s that each of them might have made in the affection of the other, even before they were aware of the danger. He believed that the match was in every re&s;pect &s;uch as to flatter the ambition of Mr. Falkland, and he was &s;tung even to madne&s;s by the idea of being de|prived of the object deare&s;t to his heart by this in&s;olent up&s;tart.</P>
<P>He had however a &s;ufficient &s;hare of di&s;cretion to go fir&s;t to demand an explanation of lady Lu|cretia. She in the gaiety of her heart trifled with his anxiety. His patience was already exhau&s;ted, and he proceeded in his expo&s;tulation in language that it was by no means po&s;&s;ible for her to endure with apathy. Lady Lucretia had always been ac|cu&s;tomed to deference and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and having got over &s;omething like terror that was fir&s;t in&s;pired by the imperious manner in which he was now ca|techi&s;ed, her next feeling was that of the warme&s;t re&s;entment. She di&s;dained to &s;atisfy &s;o in&s;olent a que&s;tioner, and even indulged her&s;elf in &s;ome ob|lique hints calculated to &s;trengthen his &s;u&s;picions. For &s;ome time &s;he de&s;cribed his folly and pre&s;ump|tion in terms of the mo&s;t ludicrous &s;arca&s;m, and then &s;uddenly changing her &s;tyle, bid him never let her &s;ee him more except upon a footing of the mo&s;t di&s;tance acquaintance, as &s;he was determined never again to &s;ubject her&s;elf to &s;o unworthy and inexcu&s;able a treatment. She was happy that he had at length di&s;clo&s;ed to her his true character, and would well know how to profit of her pre&s;ent experience to avoid a repetition of the &s;ame danger. All this pa&s;&s;ed in the full career of the pa&s;&s;ions on both &s;ides, and lady Lucretia had no time to reflect what might be the con&s;equence of having thus ex|a&s;perated her lover.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="028752_0018_0FDBEF5FCF0C7E48">
Count Malve&s;i left her in all the torments of hell. He believed that this was a premeditated &s;cene to find a pretence for breaking off an engage|ment that was already all but concluded; or rather his mind was racked with a thou&s;and conjectures, he alternately thought that the inju&s;tice might be hers or his own, and he quarrelled with lady Lu|cretia, him&s;elf and all the world. In this temper of mind he ha&s;tened to the hotel of the Engli&s;h cavalier. The moment of expo&s;tulation was now over, and he found him&s;elf irre&s;i&s;tibly impelled to ju&s;tify his precipitate conduct with the lady, by taking for granted that the pro&s;perous amours of Falkland were beyond the reach of doubt.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland was at home. The fir&s;t words of the count were an abrupt accu&s;ation of dupli|city in the affair of lady Lucretia, and a challenge. The Engli&s;hman had an unaffected e&s;teem for Mal|ve&s;i, who was in reality a man of con&s;iderable merit, and who had been one of Mr. Falkland's earlie&s;t Italian acquaintance, they having originally met at Milan. But more than this, the po&s;&s;ible con&s;equences of a duel in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance bur&s;t upon his mind. He had the warme&s;t admiration for lady Lucretia, though his feelings were not tho&s;e of a lover: and he knew that, however her haughtine&s;s might endeavour to di&s;gui&s;e it, &s;he was impre&s;&s;ed with a tender regard for count Mal|ve&s;i. He could not bear to think that any mi&s;con|duct of his &s;hould interrupt the pro&s;pects of &s;o de|&s;erving a pair. Guided by the&s;e &s;entiments he en|deavoured to expo&s;tulate with the Italian. But all his attempts in this re&s;pect were ineffectual. His antagoni&s;t was drunk with choler, and would not li&s;ten to a word that tended to check the impetuo|&s;ity of his thoughts. He traver&s;ed the room with perturbed &s;teps, and even foamed with angui&s;h and fury. Mr. Falkland, finding that every thing
<PB N="17" REF="028752_0019_0FDEB449865B0B70">
el&s;e was to no purpo&s;e, told the count that, if he would return tomorrow at the &s;ame hour, he would attend him to any &s;cene of action he would think proper to &s;elect.</P>
<P>From count Malve&s;i Mr. Falkland immediately proceeded to the palace of Pi&s;ani. Here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e found a con&s;iderable difficulty in appea&s;ing the indigna|tion of lady Lucretia. Honour forbad him to di&s;|clo&s;e the cartel he had received, though he was &s;e|cretly determined never to draw his &s;word in the pre&s;ent quarrel; otherwi&s;e that di&s;clo&s;ure would immediately have operated as the &s;tronge&s;t motive with this di&s;dainful beauty. But, though &s;he fear|ed a &s;imilar defiance, yet the vague apprehen&s;ion was not &s;trong enough to induce her without qua|lification to &s;urrender all the &s;tateline&s;s of her re|&s;entment. Mr. Falkland however drew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o intere&s;t|ing a picture of the di&s;turbance of count Malve&s;i's mind, and accounted in &s;o flattering a manner for the abruptne&s;s of his conduct, that this, together with the arguments he adduced, completed the conque&s;t of lady Lucretia's re&s;entment. Having thus far accompli&s;hed his purpo&s;e, he proceeded to di&s;clo&s;e to her every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The next day count Malve&s;i appeared, punctual to his appointment, at Mr. Falkland's hotel. Mr. Falkland came to the door to receive him, but re|que&s;ted him to enter the hou&s;e for a moment, as he had &s;till an affair of three minutes to di&s;patch. They proceeded to a parlour. Here Mr. Falkland left him, and pre&s;ently returned leading in lady Lucretia her&s;elf adorned in all her charms, and tho&s;e charms heightened upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;pirited and generous conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;he now exerted. Mr. Falkland led her up to the a&s;toni&s;hed count; and &s;he, gently laying her hand upon the arm of her lover, ex|claimed with the mo&s;t attractive grace, Will you
<PB N="18" REF="028752_0020_0FDBEF639D50C6A8">
allow me to retract the precipitate haughtine&s;s into which I was betrayed? The enraptured count, &s;carcely able to believe his &s;en&s;es, threw him&s;elf upon his knees before her, and &s;tammered out a reply, &s;ignifying that the precipitation had been all his own, that he only had any forgivene&s;s to de|mand, and, though they might pardon, he could never pardon him&s;elf for the &s;acrilege he had com|mitted again&s;t her and this god-like Engli&s;hman. As &s;oon as the fir&s;t tumults of his joy were &s;ub&s;ided, Mr. Falkland addre&s;&s;ed him thus:</P>
<P>"Count Malve&s;i, I feel the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure in having thus by peaceful means di&s;armed your re|&s;entment, and effected your happine&s;s. But I mu&s;t confe&s;s you put me to a &s;evere trial. My temper is not le&s;s impetuous and fiery than your own, and it is not at all times that I &s;hould have been thus able to &s;ubdue it. But I con&s;idered that in reality the original blame was mine. Though your &s;u&s;|picion was groundle&s;s, it was not ab&s;urd. We have been trifling too much in the face of danger. I ought not, under the pre&s;ent weakne&s;s of our nature and forms of &s;ociety, to have been &s;o a&s;&s;i|duous in my attendance upon this enchanting wo|man. It would have been little wonder, if, having &s;o many opportunities, and playing the preceptor with her as I have done, I had been entangled be|fore I was aware, and harboured a wi&s;h which I might not afterwards have had the courage to &s;ub|due. I owed you an atonement for this impru|dence.</P>
<P>"But the laws of honour are in the utmo&s;t de|gree rigid, and there was rea&s;on to fear that, how|ever anxious I were to be your friend, I might be obliged to be your murderer. Fortunately the re|putation of my courage is &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed, not to expo&s;e it to any impeachment by my de|clining your pre&s;ent defiance. It was lucky how|ever
<PB N="19" REF="028752_0021_0FDEB44C366BC340">
that in our interview of ye&s;terday you found me alone, and that accident by that means threw the management of the affair entirely into my di&s;|po&s;al. If the tran&s;action &s;hould become known, the conclu&s;ion would now become known along with the provocation, and I am &s;atisfied. But, if the challenge had been public, the proofs I had formerly given of my courage would not have excu&s;ed my pre&s;ent moderation; and though de|&s;irous to have avoided the combat, it would not have been in my power. Let us hence each of us learn to avoid ha&s;te and indi&s;cretion, the con&s;e|quences of which may be inexpiable but with blood; and may heaven ble&s;s you in a con&s;ort of whom I deem you every way worthy!"</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid that this was by no means the only in&s;tance in the cour&s;e of his travels in which Mr. Falkland acquitted him&s;elf in the mo&s;t bril|liant manner as a man of gallantry and virtue. He continued abroad during &s;everal years, every one of which brought &s;ome fre&s;h acce&s;&s;ion to the e&s;tima|tion in which he was held, as well as to his own impatience of &s;tain or di&s;honour. At length he thought proper to return to England, with the in|tention of &s;pending the re&s;t of his days at the re&s;i|dence of his ance&s;tors.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the moment of his taking a &s;tep like this, dictated as it probably was by an unaffected principle of duty, his misfortunes took their com|mencement. All I have farther to &s;tate of his hi&s;|tory is one uninterrupted per&s;ecution of a malig|nant de&s;tiny, a &s;eries of adventures which &s;eemed to take their ri&s;e in various accidents, but pointing to one termination. Him they overwhelmed with an angui&s;h he was of all others lea&s;t qualified to bear; and the&s;e waters of bitterne&s;s, extending beyond him, powered their deadly venom upon others, I my&s;elf being the mo&s;t unfortunate of their victims.</P>
<P>The per&s;on in whom the&s;e calamities principally originated, was Mr. Falkland's neare&s;t neighbour, a man of e&s;tate equal to his own, by name, Bar|nabas Tyrrel. This man one might at fir&s;t have &s;uppo&s;ed of all others lea&s;t qualified from in&s;truc|tion, or inclined by the habits of his life, to in|terfere with and di&s;turb the enjoyments of a mind &s;o richly endowed as that of Mr. Falkland. Mr. Tyrrel might have pa&s;&s;ed for a true model of the Engli&s;h &s;quire. He was very early left under the tuition of his mother, a woman of very narrow capacity, and who had no other child. This mo|ther &s;eemed to think that there was nothing in the world &s;o precious as her hopeful Barnabas. Every thing mu&s;t give way to his accommodation and ad|vantage; every one mu&s;t yield the mo&s;t &s;ervile obedience to his commands. He mu&s;t not be tea&s;ed or re&s;tricted by any forms of in&s;truction;
<PB N="21" REF="028752_0023_0FDEB44DC068CC20">
and of con&s;equence his proficiency even in the arts of writing and reading was extremely &s;lender. From his birth he was mu&s;cular and &s;turdy; and, confined to the <HI>ruelle</HI> of his mother, he made much &s;uch a figure as the whelp-lion that a bar|barian might have given for a lap-dog to his mi&s;|tre&s;s. But he &s;oon broke loo&s;e from the&s;e tram|mels, and formed an acquaintance with the groom and the game-keeper. Under their in&s;truction he proved as ready a &s;cholar as he had been indocile and re&s;tive to the pedant who held the office of his tutor. It was now evident that his &s;mall pro|ficiency in literature was by no means to be a&s;cribed to want of capacity. He di&s;covered no contempti|ble &s;agacity and quick-wittedne&s;s in the &s;cience of hor&s;e-fle&s;h, and was eminently expert in the arts of &s;hooting, fi&s;hing and hunting. Nor did he confine him&s;elf to the&s;e, but added the theory and practice of boxing, cudgel-play and quarter-&s;taff. The&s;e exerci&s;es added tenfold robu&s;tne&s;s and vigour to his former qualifications. His &s;tature, when grown, was &s;omewhat more than &s;ix feet, and his form might have been &s;elected by a painter as a model for that hero of antiquity, who&s;e prowe&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in felling an ox with his fi&s;t, and then devouring him at a meal. Con&s;cious of his advantage in this re&s;pect, he was in&s;upportably arrogant, tyrannical to his inferiors, and in&s;olent to his equals. The activity of his mind, being diverted from the ge|nuine field of utility and di&s;tinction, &s;howed it&s;elf in the rude tricks of an overgrown lubber. Here, as in all other qualifications, he ro&s;e above his competitors; and, if it had been po&s;&s;ible to over|look the callous and unrelenting di&s;po&s;ition in which they were generated, you would not have denied your applau&s;e to the invention the&s;e freaks di&s;play|ed, and the rough, &s;arca&s;tic wit with which they were accompanied.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="028752_0024_0FDBD6BE9C9ADC58">
Mr. Tyrrel was by no means inclined to permit the&s;e extraordinary merits to re&s;t in oblivion. There was a weekly a&s;&s;embly at the neare&s;t market-town, the re&s;ort of all the rural gentry. Here he had hitherto figured to the greate&s;t advantage, as grand ma&s;ter of the <HI>cot&eacute;rie,</HI> no one among them having an equal &s;hare of opulence, and the ma|jority, though &s;till pretending to the rank of gen|try, greatly his inferiors in this e&s;&s;ential article. The young men in this circle looked up to this in|&s;olent ba&s;haw with timid re&s;pect, con&s;cious of the comparative eminence that unque&s;tionably belonged to the powers of his mind; and he well knew how to maintain his rank with an inflexible hand. Fre|quently indeed he relaxed his features, and a&s;&s;umed a temporary appearance of affablene&s;s and fami|liarity; but they found by experience, that, if any one, encouraged by his conde&s;cen&s;ion, forgot the deference which Mr. Tyrrel con&s;idered as his due, he was &s;oon taught to repent his pre&s;umption. It was a tyger that, thought proper to toy with a mou&s;e, the little animal every moment in danger of being cru&s;hed by the fangs of his ferocious a&s;&s;o|ciate. As Mr. Tyrrel had a con&s;iderable copiou&s;|ne&s;s of &s;peech and a rich but undi&s;ciplined ima|gination, he was always &s;ure of an audience. His neighbours crowded round, and joined in the ready laugh, partly from ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, and partly from unfeigned admiration. It frequently happened however that in the mid&s;t of his good humour a characteri&s;tic refinement of tyranny would &s;ugge&s;t it&s;elf to his mind. When his &s;ubjects, encouraged by his familiarity, had di&s;carded their precaution, the wayward fit would &s;eize him, a &s;udden cloud over&s;pread his brow, his voice transform from the plea&s;ant to the terrible, and a quarrel of a &s;traw immediately en&s;ue with the fir&s;t man who&s;e face he did not like. The plea&s;ure that re&s;ulted to
<PB N="23" REF="028752_0025_0FDEB44F425127A8">
others from the exuberant &s;allies of his imagination was therefore not unalloyed with &s;udden qualms of apprehen&s;ion and terror. It may be believed that this de&s;poti&s;m did not gain its final a&s;cendancy without being conte&s;ted in the out&s;et. But all op|po&s;ition had been quelled with a high hand by this rural Antaeus. By the a&s;cendancy of his fortune, and his character among his neighbours, he always reduced his adver&s;ary to the nece&s;&s;ity of encoun|tering him at his own weapons, and did not di&s;|mi&s;s him without making him feel his pre&s;umption through every joint in his frame. The tyranny of Mr. Tyrrel would not have been &s;o patiently en|dured, had not his colloquial accompli&s;hments per|petually come in aid of that authority which his rank and prowe&s;s originally obtained.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of our &s;quire with the fair was &s;till more enviable than that which he maintained among per&s;ons of his own &s;ex. Every mother taught her daughter to con&s;ider the hand of Mr. Tyrrel as the highe&s;t object of her ambition. Every daughter regarded his athletic form and his ac|knowledged prowe&s;s with a favourable eye. As no man was adventurous enough to conte&s;t his &s;upe|riority, &s;o hardly any woman in this provincial circle would have &s;crupled to prefer his addre&s;&s;es to tho&s;e of any other admirer. His boi&s;terous wit had peculiar charms for them; and there was no &s;pectacle more flattering to their vanity than the &s;eeing this Hercules exchange his club for a di&s;|taff. It was plea&s;ing to them to con&s;ider that the fangs of this wild bea&s;t, the very idea of which in&s;pired trepidation into the bolde&s;t hearts, might be played with by them with the utmo&s;t &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The arrival of Mr. Falkland gave a dreadful &s;hock to the authority of Mr. Tyrrel. The di&s;po|&s;ition of the former by no means inclined him to withhold him&s;elf from &s;cenes of fa&s;hionable re&s;ort;
<PB N="24" REF="028752_0026_0FDBEF6C5BF71A78">
and he and his competitor were like two &s;tars fated never to appear at once above the horizon. The advantages that Mr. Falkland po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the com|pari&s;on are palpable; and, had it been otherwi&s;e, the &s;ubjects of his ru&s;tic neighbour were &s;uffi|ciently di&s;po&s;ed to revolt again&s;t his mercile&s;s domi|nion. They had hitherto &s;ubmitted not from love, but fear; and, if they had not actually rebelled, it was only for want of a leader. Even the ladies regarded Mr. Falkland with particular complacence. His poli&s;hed manners were admirably in uni&s;on with feminine delicacy. The &s;allies of his wit were far beyond tho&s;e of Mr. Tyrrel in variety and vi|gour; in addition to which they had the advan|tage of having their &s;pontaneous exuberance guided and re&s;trained by the &s;agacity of a cultivated mind. The graces of his per&s;on were enhanced by the elegance of his deportment; and the benevolence and liberality of his temper were upon all occa&s;ions con&s;picuous. It was common indeed to Mr. Tyr|rel together with Mr. Falkland to be little acce&s;&s;ible to &s;entiments of awkwardne&s;s and confu&s;ion. But for this Mr. Tyrrell was indebted to a &s;elf-&s;atisfied effrontery and a boi&s;terous and over-bearing elo|cution by which he was accu&s;tomed to di&s;comfit his a&s;&s;ailants; while Mr. Falkland, with great in|genuity and candour of mind, was enabled, by his exten&s;ive knowledge of the world and acquaintance with his own re&s;ources, to perceive almo&s;t in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly the proceeding it mo&s;t became him to adopt.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel contemplated the progre&s;s of his rival with unea&s;ine&s;s and aver&s;ion. He often comment|ed upon it to his particular confidents as a thing altogether inconceivable. Mr. Falkland he de&s;crib|ed as an animal that was beneath contempt. Di|minutive and dwarfi&s;h in his form, he wanted to &s;et up a new &s;tandard of human nature adapted to
<PB N="25" REF="028752_0027_0FDEB456C9B2AE68">
his own mi&s;erable condition. He wi&s;hed to per|&s;uade people that the human &s;pecies were made to be nailed to a chair and to pore over books. He would have them exchange tho&s;e robu&s;t exerci&s;es which made us joyous in the performance and vigorous in the con&s;equences, for the wi&s;e labour of &s;cratching our heads for a rhyme and counting our fingers for a ver&s;e. Monkeys were as good men as the&s;e. A nation of &s;uch animals would have no chance with a &s;ingle regiment of the old Engli&s;h votaries of beef and pudding. For his own part he never &s;aw any thing come of learning but to make people foppi&s;h and impertinent; and a &s;en&s;ible man would not wi&s;h any wor&s;e calamity to the enemies of his nation than to &s;ee them run mad after &s;uch pernicious ab&s;urdities. It was im|po&s;&s;ible that people could &s;eriou&s;ly feel any liking for &s;uch a ridiculous piece of goods as this out|landi&s;h, foreign-made Engli&s;hman. But he knew very well how it was; it was all a mi&s;erable piece of mummery that was played only in &s;pite to him. But G&mdash;for ever bla&s;t his &s;oul, if he were not bit|terly revenged upon them all!</P>
<P>If &s;uch were the &s;entiments of Mr. Tyrrel, his patience found ample exerci&s;e in the language which was held by the re&s;t of his neighbours on the &s;ame &s;ubject. While he &s;aw nothing in Mr. Falkland but matter for contempt, they appeared to be never weary of recounting his prai&s;es. Such dignity, &s;uch affability, &s;o perpetual an attention to the hap|pine&s;s of others, &s;uch delicacy of &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion! Learned without o&s;tentation, refined without foppery, elegant without effeminacy! Per|petually anxious to prevent his &s;uperiority either in wealth or accompli&s;hments from being painfully felt, it was felt &s;o much the more certainly, and excited congratulation in&s;tead of envy in the &s;pec|tator. It is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to remark that the
<PB N="26" REF="028752_0028_0FDBEF7157C718E0">
revolution in this ca&s;e belongs to one of the mo&s;t obvious features of the human mind. The rude&s;t exhibition of art is at fir&s;t admired; till a nobler is pre&s;ented, and we are taught to wonder at the fa|cility with which before we had been &s;atisfied. Mr. Tyrrel thought there would be no end to the commendation; and expected when their common acquaintance would fall down and adore him. The mo&s;t inadvertent expre&s;&s;ion of applau&s;e towards his rival inflicted upon him the torment of demons. He writhed with agony, his features became di&s;|torted, and his looks in&s;pired terror. Such &s;uffer|ing would probably have &s;oured the kinde&s;t tem|per; what mu&s;t have been its effect upon Mr. Tyr|rel's, always fierce, unrelenting and abrupt?</P>
<P>The advantages of Mr. Falkland &s;eemed by no means to dimini&s;h with their novelty. Every new &s;ufferer from Mr. Tyrrel's tyranny immediately went over to the &s;tandard of his adver&s;ary. The ladies, though treated by their ru&s;tic &s;wain with more gentlene&s;s than the men, were occa&s;ionally expo&s;ed to his capriciou&s;ne&s;s and in&s;olence. They could not help remarking the contra&s;t between the&s;e two leaders in the fields of Venus, the one of whom paid no attention to any one's plea&s;ure but his own, while the other &s;eemed all good humour and bene|volence. It was in vain that Mr. Tyrrel endea|voured to re&s;train the ruggedne&s;s of his character. His motive was impatience, his thoughts were gloomy, and his court&s;hip was like the pawings of an elephant. It appeared as if his temper were more human while he had indulged it in its free bent, than now that he &s;ullenly endeavoured to put fetters upon its exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Among the ladies of the village a&s;&s;embly already mentioned there was none that &s;eemed to engage more of the kindne&s;s of Mr. Tyrrel than Mi&s;s Hardingham. She was al&s;o one of the few that
<PB N="27" REF="028752_0029_0FDEB43225F0D460">
had not yet gone over to the enemy, either becau&s;e &s;he really preferred the gentleman who was her olde&s;t acquaintance, or conceiving from calculation that this conduct would be&s;t in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s to her object in a hu&s;band. One day however &s;he thought proper, probably only by way of temporary expe|riment, to &s;how Mr. Tyrrel that &s;he could engage in ho&s;tilities, if he &s;hould at any time give her &s;uffi|cient provocation. She accordingly &s;o adju&s;ted her manoeuvres as to be engaged by Mr. Falkland as his partner for the dance of the evening, though without the &s;malle&s;t intention on the part of that gentleman of giving offence to his country neigh|bour.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time before the dances began, Mr. Tyr|rel went up to his fair inamorata, and entered into &s;ome trifling conver&s;ation with her to fill up the time, as intending in a few minutes to lead her forward to the field. He had accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to neglect the ceremony of &s;oliciting beforehand a promi&s;e in his favour, as not &s;uppo&s;ing it po&s;&s;ible that any one &s;hould dare to di&s;pute his behe&s;ts; and, had it been otherwi&s;e, he would have thought the formality unnece&s;&s;ary in this ca&s;e, his general preference to Mi&s;s Hardingham being &s;ufficiently notorious.</P>
<P>While he was thus engaged, Mr. Falkland came up. Mr. Tyrrel always regarded him with aver|&s;ion and loathing. Mr. Falkland however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lided in a graceful and unaffected manner into the conver|&s;ation that was already begun, and the well-mean|ing ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of his manner was &s;uch, as might for the time have di&s;armed the devil of his malice. Mr. Tyrrel probably conceived that his acco&s;ting Mi&s;s Hardingham might be only an accidental piece of general ceremony, and expected every moment when he would withdraw to another part of the
<PB N="28" REF="028752_0030_0FDBEF717A764348">
room. Still he &s;taid, as if determined to tire out the patience of the ru&s;tic.</P>
<P>The company now began to be in motion for the dance, and Mr. Falkland informed Mi&s;s Harding|ham that it was time to advance.&mdash;Sir, interrupted Mr. Tyrrel abruptly, that lady is my partner.&mdash;I think not, &s;ir: I apprehend the lady has done me that favour, and I am very &s;ure &s;he has not pro|mi&s;ed her&s;elf to both.&mdash;I tell you, &s;ir, &s;he is mine: I pretend to think that I have &s;ome intere&s;t in that lady's affections; and I will &s;uffer no man to in|trude upon my claims.&mdash;The lady's affections are not the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent que&s;tion.&mdash;And pray, what is the &s;ubject? Ob&s;erve, &s;ir, I will not re|cede.&mdash;Mr. Tyrrel, there is no need of altercation in the pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s: the ma&s;ter of the ceremo|nies is the proper per&s;on to decide; and, as neither of us can intend to di&s;turb the good humour of the a&s;&s;embly, or exhibit our valour before the ladies, we &s;hall either of us chearfully &s;ubmit to his ver|dict.&mdash;Damn me, &s;ir, if I under&s;tand&mdash;Softly, Mr. Tyrrel. It really is not worth the while of either of us to quarrel about a que&s;tion that the forms of good company have long ago decided. I intended you no offence. But, &s;ir, I &s;hall be ab&s;olute in a&s;&s;erting that to which I have once acquired a claim. And you will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve that it is not my cu&s;tom to &s;ubmit to any unbecoming liberties.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland uttered the&s;e words with the mo&s;t even temper in the world. There was not in his manner the &s;lighte&s;t appearance of defiance. The words, delivered with a certain tone, might have had the appearance of an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ront. But they were uttered with the tone of a remon&s;trance, calm, una&s;&s;uming, and benevolent, without being con|temptuous. Mi&s;s Hardingham had begun to re|pent of her experiment, but her alarm was &s;ud|denly quieted by the irre&s;i&s;tible compo&s;ure of her
<PB N="29" REF="028752_0031_0FDEB45B1135BF18">
new partner. Mr. Tyrrel walked away without an&s;wering a word. He muttered cur&s;es as he went, which the laws of honour did not oblige Mr. Falk|land to overhear, and which indeed it would have been no ea&s;y ta&s;k to have overheard with accuracy. Mr. Tyrrel would not perhaps have &s;o ea&s;ily given up his point, had not his own good &s;en&s;e pre&s;ently taught him that, however eager he might be for revenge, this was not the ground he &s;hould de&s;ire to occupy. Add to this, that unaccu&s;tomed as he was to &s;trenuous oppo&s;ition, he was le&s;s prepared in&s;tantaneou&s;ly to encounter it; and indeed there was &s;omething in Mr. Falkland's manner that ex|torted a&s;&s;ent for the pre&s;ent, however prejudice might rea&s;&s;ume its dominion. But, though Mr. Tyrrel could not openly re&s;ent this rebellion again&s;t his authority, he brooded over it in the rece&s;&s;es of a malignant mind; and it was evident enough that he was accumulating materials for a bitter account, to which he tru&s;ted that his adver&s;ary &s;hould one day be brought.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was only one out of innumerable in|&s;tances that every day &s;eemed to enlarge, of petty mortifications which Mr. Tyrrel was de&s;tined to endure on the part of Mr. Falkland. In every one of them Mr. Falkland conducted him&s;elf with &s;uch propriety and unaffected mildne&s;s, as perpetually to make &s;ome addition to the &s;tock of his reputation. The more Mr. Tyrrel &s;truggled with his misfortune, the more con&s;picuous and in|veterate it became. A thou&s;and times he cur&s;ed his &s;tars, which took, as he apprehended, a mali|cious plea&s;ure in making Mr. Falkland at every turn the in&s;trument of his humiliation. Smarting as he was under a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of untoward events, he appeared to feel in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite manner the di&s;tinctions paid to his adver&s;ary, even in tho&s;e particulars to which he had not the &s;lighte&s;t pre|ten&s;ions. An in&s;tance of this &s;peedily occurred.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare, a poet who&s;e works have done im|mortal honour to the country that produced him, had lately retired, after a life &s;pent in the &s;ublime&s;t e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">orts of genius, to enjoy the produce of his economy and the reputation he had acquired, in this very neighbourhood. Such an inmate was looked up to by the country gentlemen with a de|gree of adoration. They felt a con&s;cious pride in recollecting that the boa&s;t of England was a native of their vicinity, and they were by no means defi|cient in gratitude to him, when they &s;aw him who had left them an adventurer, return into the mid&s;t of them in the clo&s;e of his days crowned with ho|nours
<PB N="31" REF="028752_0033_0FDEB45C94F87050">
and opulence. The reader is acquainted with his works; he has probably dwelt upon them with tran&s;port: and I need not remind him of their excellence. But he is perhaps a &s;tranger to his per&s;onal qualifications. He does not know that his productions were &s;carcely more admirable than his conver&s;ation. In company he &s;eemed to be the only per&s;on ignorant of the greatne&s;s of his fame. To the world his writings will long remain a kind of &s;pecimen of what the human mind is capable of performing; but no man perceived their defects &s;o acutely as he, or &s;aw &s;o di&s;tinctly how much yet remained to be effected. He alone appeared to look upon his works with &s;uperiority and in|difference. One of the features that mo&s;t emi|nently di&s;tingui&s;hed him was a perpetual &s;uavity of manners, a comprehen&s;ivene&s;s of mind, that re|garded the errors of others without a particle of re&s;entment, and made it impo&s;&s;ible for any one to be his enemy. He pointed out to men their mi&s;|takes with frankne&s;s and unre&s;erve: his remon|&s;trances produced a&s;toni&s;hment and conviction, but without unea&s;ine&s;s to the party to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed: they felt the in&s;trument that was em|ployed to correct their irregularities, but it never mangled what it was intended to heal. Such were the moral qualities that di&s;tingui&s;hed him among his acquaintance. The intellectual accompli&s;h|ments he exhibited were principally a tranquil and mild enthu&s;ia&s;m, and a richne&s;s of conception that dictated &s;pontaneou&s;ly to his tongue, and flowed with &s;o much ea&s;e, that it was only by retro&s;pect you could be made aware of the amazing variety of ideas that had been pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare certainly found few men in this re|mote &s;ituation that were capable of participating in his ideas and amu&s;ements. It has not &s;eldom been the weakne&s;s of great men to fly to &s;olitude,
<PB N="32" REF="028752_0034_0FDBEF76DA07F0C0">
and conver&s;e with woods and groves, rather than with a circle of &s;trong and comprehen&s;ive minds like their own. From the moment of Mr. Falk|land's arrival in the neighbourhood Mr. Clare di&s;|tingui&s;hed him in the mo&s;t flattering manner. To &s;o penetrating a genius there was no need of long experience and patient ob&s;ervation to di&s;cover the merits and defects of any character that pre&s;ented it&s;elf. The foundations of his judgment had long &s;ince been accumulated, and at the clo&s;e of &s;o il|lu&s;trious a life he might almo&s;t be &s;aid to &s;ee through nature at a glance. What wonder that he took &s;ome intere&s;t in a mind in a certain degree congenial with his own? But to Mr. Tyrrel's di&s;ea&s;ed imagination every di&s;tinction be&s;towed on another &s;eemed to be expre&s;sly intended as an in&s;ult to him. On the other hand Mr. Clare, though gentle and benevolent in his remon&s;trances to a degree that made the taking of offence impo&s;&s;ible, was by no means par&s;imonious of prai&s;e, or &s;low to make u&s;e of the deference that was paid him, for the purpo&s;e of doing ju&s;tice to merit. The pain which Mr. Tyrrel endured from this circum|&s;tance in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance was extreme.</P>
<P>It happened at one of tho&s;e public meetings at which Mr. Falkland and Mr. Tyrrel were pre&s;ent, that the conver&s;ation, in one of the mo&s;t numerous knots into which the company was broken, turned upon the poetical talents of the former. A lady, who was pre&s;ent, and was di&s;tingui&s;hed for the acutene&s;s of her under&s;tanding, &s;aid, &s;he had been favoured with the &s;ight of a poem he had ju&s;t written, entitled, an Ode to the Genius of Chivalry, which appeared to her of exqui&s;ite merit. The curio&s;ity of the company was immediately excited, and the lady added, &s;he had a copy in her pocket, which would be very much at their &s;ervice, provided its being thus produced would not be di&s;|agreeable
<PB N="33" REF="028752_0035_0FDEB463A3345828">
to the author. The whole circle imme|diately intreated Mr. Falkland to comply with their wi&s;hes, and Mr. Clare, who was one of the com|pany, inforced their petition. Nothing gave this gentleman &s;o much plea&s;ure as to have an oppor|tunity of witne&s;&s;ing and doing ju&s;tice to the exhi|bition of intellectual excellence. Mr. Falkland had no fal&s;e mode&s;ty or affectation, and therefore readily yielded his con&s;ent. If their kindne&s;s led them to expect too much, the lo&s;s, he &s;aid, was theirs. What he ought mo&s;t to de&s;ire was to be &s;et right, and he hoped he had fortitude enough tranquilly to abide the verdict of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel accidentally &s;at at the extremity of this circle. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that the turn the conver&s;ation had taken was by any means agree|able to him. He &s;eemed to wi&s;h to withdraw him|&s;elf, but there was &s;ome unknown power that as it were by enchantment retained him in his place, and made him con&s;ent to drink to the dregs the bitter potion which envy had prepared from him.</P>
<P>The poem was read to the re&s;t of the company by Mr. Clare, who&s;e elocution was &s;carcely inferior to his other accompli&s;hments. Simplicity, di&s;cri|mination and energy con&s;tantly attended him in the act of reading, and it is not ea&s;y to conceive a more refined delight than fell to the lot of tho&s;e who had the good fortune to be his auditors. The beauties of Mr. Falkland's poem were accordingly exhibited with every advantage. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ive pa&s;&s;ions of the author were communicated to the reader. Every word was impre&s;&s;ed with its true value, and none was brought forward with di&s;pro|portioned and elaborate empha&s;is. The pictures conjured up by the creative <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ancy of the poet were placed full to view, at one time overwhelming the &s;oul with &s;uper&s;titious awe, at another tran&s;porting it with luxuriant beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="028752_0036_0FDBEF785F244E28">
The character of the hearers upon this occa&s;ion has already been de&s;cribed. They were for the mo&s;t part plain, unlettered, and of little refine|ment. Poetry in general they read, when read at all, from the mere force of imitation and with few &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure; but this poem had a pecu|liar vein of glowing in&s;piration. This very poem would probably have been &s;een by many of them with little effect; but the rhetoric of Mr. Clare carried it home to the heart. He ended; and, as the countenances of his auditors had before gone along with the pa&s;&s;ions of the compo&s;ition, &s;o now they emulated each other in giving language to their approbation. They were &s;urpri&s;ed into a &s;ort of applau&s;e to which they were little accu&s;tomed. One &s;poke and another followed by a &s;ort of un|controulable impul&s;e; and the rude and broken manner of their commendations rendered them the more &s;ingular and remarkable. But what was lea&s;t to be endured was the behaviour of Mr. Clare. He returned the manu&s;cript to the lady from whom he had received it, and then turning to Mr. Falk|land &s;aid with empha&s;is and animation: Why, this is well, &s;ir. It is of the right &s;tamp; none of your hard e&s;&s;ays &s;trained from the ninefold labour of a pedant, or of your pa&s;toral ditties mo&s;t di&s;|mally di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in &s;earch of a meaning. We want &s;uch people as you. But remember, young man, the mu&s;e was not given to add new refinements to idlene&s;s, but for the deliverance of the world.</P>
<P>A moment after Mr. Clare had thus expre&s;&s;|ed him&s;elf, he quitted his &s;eat, and with Mr. Falkland and two or three more withdrew. As &s;oon as they were gone, Mr. Tyrrel edged farther into the circle. He had &s;at &s;ilent &s;o long that he &s;eemed ready to bur&s;t with gall and indignation. Mighty pretty ver&s;es, &s;aid he, half talking to him|&s;elf, and not addre&s;&s;ing any particular per&s;on:
<PB N="35" REF="028752_0037_0FDEB46651545338">
why, aye, the ver&s;es were well enough. Damna|tion! I &s;hould like to know what a &s;hip-load of &s;uch &s;tuff is good for.</P>
<P>Why, &s;urely, &s;aid the lady who had introduced Mr. Falkland's ode on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, you mu&s;t allow that poetry is a very agreeable and ele|gant amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Elegant, quotha!&mdash;Why, look at this Falkland! A puny bit of a thing! In the devil's name, ma|dam, do you think he would write poetry if he could do any thing better?</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation did not &s;top here. The lady expo&s;tulated. Several other per&s;ons, fre&s;h from the &s;en&s;ation they had felt, put in their &s;hare. Mr. Tyrrel grew more violent in his invectives, and found ea&s;e in uttering them. The per&s;ons who were able in any degree to check his vehemence were withdrawn. One &s;peaker after another &s;hrunk back into &s;ilence, too timid to oppo&s;e, or too indo|lent to contend with the fiercene&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ion. He found the appearance of his old a&s;cendancy; but he felt its deceitfulne&s;s and uncertainty, and was gloomily di&s;&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>In his return from this a&s;&s;embly he was accom|panied by a young man whom &s;imilitude of man|ners had rendered one of his principal confidents, and who&s;e road home was in part the &s;ame as his own. One would have thought that Mr. Tyrrel had &s;ufficiently vented his &s;pleen in the dialogue he had ju&s;t been holding with the lady and her a&s;&s;o|ciates. But he was unable to di&s;mi&s;s from his re|collection the angui&s;h he had endured. Damn Falkland! &s;aid he. What a pitiful &s;coundrel is here to make all this bu&s;tle about! But women and fools always will be fools; there is no help for that! Tho&s;e that &s;et them on have mo&s;t to an&s;wer for; and mo&s;t of all Mr. Clare. He is a man that ought to know &s;omething of the world, and pa&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="028752_0038_0FDBEF804E6E88C8">
being duped by gewgaws and tin&s;el. He &s;eemed too to have &s;ome &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice: I &s;hould not have &s;u&s;pected him of hallooing to a cry of mongrels without hone&s;ty or rea&s;on. But the world is all alike. Tho&s;e that &s;eem better than their neigh|bours are only more artful. They mean the &s;ame thing, though they take a different road. He de|ceived me for a while, but it is all out now. They are the makers of all the mi&s;chief. Fools might blunder, but they would not per&s;i&s;t, if people that ought to &s;et them right, did not encourage them to go wrong.</P>
<P>A few days after this adventure Mr. Tyrrel was &s;urpri&s;ed to receive a vi&s;it from Mr. Falkland. It was the fir&s;t that had ever pa&s;&s;ed, they having never before &s;een each other but at a third place. Mr. Falkland proceeded without ceremony to explain the motive of his coming.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, &s;aid he, I am come to have an ami|cable explanation with you.</P>
<P>Explanation! What is my offence?</P>
<P>None in the world, &s;ir; and for that rea&s;on I conceive this the fitte&s;t time for us to come to a right under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>You are in the devil of a hurry, &s;ir. Are you clear that this ha&s;te will not mar, in&s;tead of make an under&s;tanding?</P>
<P>I think I am, &s;ir. I have great faith in the pu|rity of my intentions, and I will not doubt that, when you perceive the view with which I come, you will willingly co-operate with it.</P>
<P>Mayhap, Mr. Falkland, we may not agree about that. One man thinks one way, and another man thinks another. Mayhap I do not think I have any great rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with you already.</P>
<P>It may be &s;o. I cannot however charge my&s;elf with having giving you rea&s;on to be di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="028752_0039_0FDEB467D6757B30">
Mr. Tyrrel, proceeded Mr. Falkland, you will readily imagine that the cau&s;e that brought me hi|ther was not a &s;light one. I would not have trou|bled you with a vi&s;it but for important rea&s;ons. My coming is a pledge how deeply I am my&s;elf impre&s;&s;ed with what I have to communicate.</P>
<P>We are in a critical &s;ituation. We are upon the brink of a whirlpool which, if once it get hold of us, will render all farther deliberation impotent. Shall we be enemies? What benefit will be derived from that? Who ever found in gall, malice, &s;u&s;|picion and hatred the materials of happine&s;s? No; to the brea&s;t where they enter, happine&s;s is for ever a &s;tranger. They haunt our relaxations, they poi&s;on our plea&s;ures, they hardly allow us a mo|ment of unmixed &s;atisfaction. A brow of care, a cankered heart, a bo&s;om bur&s;ting with rage, the&s;e are their retinue.&mdash;If we be enemies, who &s;hall tell where our enmity &s;hall &s;top? Every new event will feed it; it will &s;well beyond imagination or li|mit; ever &s;eeming enlarged to its utmo&s;t &s;ize, it will &s;till become more mon&s;trous, more intolerable!</P>
<P>Upon my &s;oul, you are an extraordinary man,&mdash;an impertinent man! Why intrude upon me your prophecies and forebodings?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary to your happine&s;s. Be|cau&s;e it becomes me to tell you of our danger now, rather than wait till my character will permit me to be &s;ilent no longer.</P>
<P>Sir, I mean to take care of my own happine&s;s. I do not thank you for your interference. Damn me, if I think this is any thing el&s;e but a trick to put a new feather in your cap at your neighbour's expence.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, it is to provide again&s;t &s;uch mi&s;con|&s;tructions on either part that I have &s;ought you. I know the infirmity of my temper, but at lea&s;t upon this occa&s;ion I am determined not to take any
<PB N="38" REF="028752_0040_0FDBEF815B345B00">
thing ill. If my intention had been to out&s;hine you, &s;hould I have come alone?</P>
<P>Well, &s;ir, you have no right to put me out of humour with my&s;elf. If you come to play upon me, and try what &s;ort of a fellow you &s;hall have to deal with, damn me, if you &s;hall have any rea|&s;on to hug your&s;elf upon the experiment.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, nothing is more ea&s;y for us than to quarrel. If you de&s;ire that, there is no fear that you will find opportunities.</P>
<P>Damn me, &s;ir, if I do not believe you are come to bully me.</P>
<P>Good God, Mr. Tyrrel, be le&s;s unju&s;t! My character is too well known to allow it to be &s;up|po&s;ed that I fear any man, and I do not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect you of a weakne&s;s in that re&s;pect to which I am my&s;elf a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ir, that is thereafter as it may be.</P>
<P>By quarrelling we &s;hall but imitate the great ma&s;s of mankind who could ea&s;ily quarrel in our place. Let us do better. Let us &s;how that we have the wi&s;dom to avoid vulgar errors, and the magnani|mity to condemn petty mi&s;under&s;tandings. We are formed in different habits; why &s;hould we in|terfere? The world is wide enough for both. By thus judging we &s;hall do our&s;elves mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial honour. By a contrary conduct we &s;hall be our|&s;elves the &s;ufferers, and merely pre&s;ent a comedy for the amu&s;ement of our acquaintance.</P>
<P>Do you think &s;o? There may be &s;omething in that. Damn me, if I con&s;ent to be the je&s;t of any man living.</P>
<P>You are right, Mr. Tyrrel. Let us each act in the manner be&s;t calculated to excite re&s;pect. We neither of us wi&s;h to change roads with the other; let us each &s;uffer the other to pur&s;ue his own track unmole&s;ted. Be this our compact; and by mutual forbearance let us pre&s;erve mutual peace.</P>

Saying this, Mr. Falkland put out his hand in token of fellow&s;hip. But the ge&s;ture was too &s;ignificant. The wayward Tyrrel, who &s;eemed to have been &s;omewhat impre&s;&s;ed by what had pre|ceded, taken as he was now by &s;urpri&s;e, &s;hrunk back.</P>
<P>All this is very unaccountable, cried he. What the devil can have made you &s;o forward, if you had not &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly purpo&s;e to an&s;wer by which I am to be overreached?</P>
<P>My purpo&s;e, replied Mr. Falkland, is a manly and an hone&s;t purpo&s;e. Why &s;hould you refu&s;e a propo&s;ition dictated by rea&s;on, and an equal re|gard to the intere&s;t of each?&mdash;Mr. Tyrrel had had an opportunity for pau&s;e, and fell back into his habitual character.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ir, in all this I mu&s;t own there is &s;ome frankne&s;s. Now I will return you like for like. It is no matter how I came by it, my temper is rough, and will not be controuled. Mayhap you may think it a weakne&s;s, but I do not de&s;ire to &s;ee it altered. Till you came, I found my&s;elf very well: I liked my neighbours, and my neighbours hu|moured me. But now the ca&s;e is entirely alter|ed; and, as long as I cannot &s;tir abroad without meeting with &s;ome mortification in which you are directly or remotely concerned, I am determined to hate you. Now, &s;ir, if you will only go out of the county or the kingdom, to the devil if you plea&s;e, &s;o as I may never hear of you any more, I will promi&s;e never to quarrel with you as long as I live. Your poetry and your delicacy, your quirks and your conundrums may then be the very paragon of excellence for what I care.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, attend to rea&s;on. I might as well de&s;ire you to leave the county, as you de&s;ire me. I came here to you, not as to a ma&s;ter, but an equal. In the &s;ociety of men we mu&s;t have &s;ome|thing
<PB N="40" REF="028752_0042_0FDBEF865EF811F0">
to bear, as well as to perform. No man mu&s;t think that the world was made for him alone. Let us then take things as we find them; and ac|commodate our&s;elves with prudence to unavoid|able circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>True, &s;ir, all that is very fine talking. But I return to my text; we are as God made us. I am neither a philo&s;opher nor a poet, to &s;et out upon a wild-goo&s;e cha&s;e of making my&s;elf a different man from what you find me. As for con&s;e|quences, what mu&s;t be mu&s;t be. As we brew, we mu&s;t bake. And &s;o, do you &s;ee, I &s;hall not trouble my&s;elf about what is to be, but &s;tand up to it with a &s;tout heart when it comes. Only this I can tell you, that, as long as I find you thru&s;t into my di&s;h every day, I &s;hall hate you as bad as &s;enna and valerian. And damn me, if I do not think I hate you the more for coming to-day in this prag|matical way when nobody &s;ent for you, on purpo&s;e to &s;how how much wi&s;er you are than all the world be&s;ides.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, I have done. I fore&s;aw con&s;e|quences, and came as a friend to advi&s;e you. I did hope that by mutual explanation we &s;hould each of us have improved in the good opinion of the other. I am partly di&s;appointed; but I &s;till believe that when you coolly reflect on what has pa&s;&s;ed, you will give me credit for the hone&s;ty of my intentions, and be di&s;po&s;ed to think of me with the &s;ame con&s;ideration and liberality as I am determined to exerci&s;e towards you.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, Mr. Falkland departed; and Mr. Tyrrel had recour&s;e to his old friend, to whom he unburthened the tumult of his thoughts. This, cried he, is a new artifice of the fellow to prove his imagined &s;uperiority. We know very well that he has the gift of the gab. To be &s;ure, if the world were to be governed by words, he would
<PB N="41" REF="028752_0043_0FDEB47108758AE8">
be in the right box. Oh, yes, he had it all hollow before him! But what &s;ignifies prating? Bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be done in an other-gue&s;s way than that. I wonder what po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me that I did not kick him! But that is all to come. This is only a new debt added to the &s;core which he &s;hall one day richly pay. This Falkland haunts me like a demon. I cannot wake, but I think of him. I cannot &s;leep, but I &s;ee him. He poi&s;ons all my plea&s;ures. I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee him torn with tenter-hooks, and to grind his heart-&s;trings with my teeth. I &s;hall know no joy, till I &s;ee him ruined. There may be &s;ome things right about him; but he is my perpetual torment. The thought of him pre&s;&s;es like a dead weight upon my heart, and I have a right to throw it off. Does he think I will feel all that I endure for nothing?</P>
<P>In &s;pite of the acerbity of Mr. Tyrrel's feelings, it is probable however he did &s;ome ju&s;tice to his rival. Upon ordinary occa&s;ions at lea&s;t he &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to treat him with an involuntary defe|rence. He was no longer equally voluble in mixed companies in his abu&s;e of him; a part of the topics of his invective &s;eemed to be gone. He was no longer eager to treat him with random ho&s;tility; if he regarded him with equal di&s;like, he at lea&s;t appeared to regard him as a formidable foe. He avoided his encounter; he forbore to contradict his opinions; he &s;eemed to lie in wait for his victim, and to collect his venom for a mortal a&s;&s;ault.</P>

<P>IT was not long after that a malignant contagious di&s;temper broke out in the neighbour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ood, which proved fatal to many of the inhabitants, and was of unexampled rapidity in its effects. One of the fir&s;t per&s;ons that was &s;eized with it was Mr. Clare. It may be believed that this incident &s;pread grief and alarm through the vicinity. Mr. Clare was con&s;idered by them as &s;omething more than a mor|tal. The equanimity of his behaviour, his un|a&s;&s;uming carriage, his exuberant benevolence and goodne&s;s of heart, joined with his talents, his inoffen&s;ive wit, and the comprehen&s;ivene&s;s of his intelligence made him the idol of all that knew him. In the &s;cene of his rural retreat at lea&s;t he had not an enemy. All mourned the danger that now threatened him. He appeared to have the pro&s;pect of long life, and of going down to his grave full of years and of honour. Perhaps the&s;e appearances were deceitful. Perhaps the intel|lectual efforts he had exerted, which were occa|&s;ionally more &s;udden, violent and unintermitted than a &s;trict regard to health would have dictated, had laid the &s;eeds of future di&s;ea&s;e. But a &s;an|guine ob&s;erver would infallibly have predicted, that his good &s;en&s;e, pre&s;ence of mind and unaltered chearfulne&s;s would be able even to keep death at bay for a time and baffle the attacks of di&s;temper, provided this univer&s;al foe did not take him by &s;ur|pri&s;e. The general affliction therefore was doubly pungent upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="028752_0045_0FDEB473CECDBFC8">
But no one was &s;o much affected as Mr. Falk|land. Perhaps no man living &s;o well under&s;tood the value of the life that was now at &s;take. He immediately ha&s;tened to the &s;pot; but he found &s;ome difficulty in gaining admi&s;&s;ion. Mr. Clare, aware of the infectious nature of his di&s;ea&s;e, had given directions that as few people as po&s;&s;ible &s;hould approach him. Mr. Falkland &s;ent up his name. He was told that he was included in the general orders. He was not however of a temper to be ea&s;ily repul&s;ed; he per&s;i&s;ted with ob&s;tinacy, and at length carried his point, being only reminded in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to employ tho&s;e precautions which experience has approved as mo&s;t effectual for coun|teracting infection.</P>
<P>He found Mr. Clare in his bedchamber, but not in bed. He was &s;itting in his night-gown at a bureau near the window. His appearance was compo&s;ed and chearful, but death was in his coun|tenance. I had a great inclination, Mr. Falkland, &s;aid he, not to have &s;uffered you to come in; and yet there is not a per&s;on in the world it could give me more plea&s;ure to &s;ee. But upon &s;econd thoughts I believe there are few people that could run into a danger of this kind with a better pro&s;pect of e&s;caping. In your ca&s;e, at lea&s;t the garri&s;on will not be taken through the treachery of the com|mander. I cannot tell how it is that I, who can preach wi&s;dom to you, have my&s;elf been caught. But do not be di&s;couraged by my example. I had no notice of my danger, or I would have acquitted my&s;elf better. The&s;e &s;trange &s;eeds of di&s;temper &s;eem to float in the air, and to fa&s;ten upon the frame without its being po&s;&s;ible for us to tell what was the method of their approach.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland, having once e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf in the apartment of his friend, would upon no terms con&s;ent to retire. Mr. Clare con&s;idered that there
<PB N="44" REF="028752_0046_0FDBEF8D3174B888">
was perhaps le&s;s danger in this choice than in a frequent change from the extremes of a pure to a tainted air, and de&s;i&s;ted from his expo&s;tulation. Falkland, &s;aid he, when you came in, I had ju&s;t fini&s;hed making my will. I was not plea&s;ed with what I had formerly drawn up upon that &s;ubject, and I did not choo&s;e in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation to call in an attorney. In fact it would be &s;trange if a man of &s;en&s;e with pure and direct intentions &s;hould not be able to perform &s;uch a function for him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare continued to act in the &s;ame ea&s;y and di&s;engaged manner as in perfect health. To judge from the chearfulne&s;s of his tone and the firmne&s;s of his manner, the thought would never once have occurred to you that he was dying. He walked, he rea&s;oned, he je&s;ted, in a way that argued the mo&s;t perfect &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But his appearance changed perceptibly for the wor&s;e every quarter of an hour. Mr. Falkland kept his eye perpetually fixed upon him with mingled &s;entiments of anxiety and admiration.</P>
<P>Falkland, &s;aid he, after having appeared for a &s;hort period ab&s;orbed in thought, I feel that I am dying. This is a &s;trange di&s;temper of mine. Ye&s;|terday I &s;eemed in perfect health, and to-morrow I &s;hall be an in&s;en&s;ible corp&s;e. How curious is the line that &s;eparates life and death to mortal men! To be at one moment active, gay, penetrating, with immen&s;e &s;tores of knowledge at one's com|mand, capable of delighting, in&s;tructing and ani|mating mankind, and the next, lifele&s;s and loath|&s;ome, an incumbrance upon the face of the earth. Such is the hi&s;tory of many men, and &s;uch will be mine.</P>
<P>I feel as if I had yet much to do in the world; but it will not be. I mu&s;t be contented with what is pa&s;t. It is in vain that I mu&s;ter all my &s;pirits to
<PB N="45" REF="028752_0047_0FDEB475567FB848">
my heart. The enemy is too mighty and too mer|cile&s;s for me; he will not give me time &s;o much as to breathe. The&s;e things are not yet in our power. They are parts of a great &s;eries that is perpetually flowing. The general welfare, the great bu&s;ine&s;s of the univer&s;e, will go on, though I bear no far|ther &s;hare in promoting it. That ta&s;k is re&s;erved for younger &s;trengths, for you, Falkland, and &s;uch as you. We &s;hould be contemptible indeed, if the pro&s;pect of human improvement did not yield us a pure and perfect delight, independently of the que&s;tion of our exi&s;ting to partake of it. Man|kind would have little to envy to future ages, if they had all enjoyed a &s;erenity as perfect as mine.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare &s;at up through the whole day, indulg|ing him&s;elf in ea&s;y and chearful exertions, which were perhaps better calculated to refre&s;h and invi|gorate the frame, than if he had &s;ought repo&s;e in its direct form. Now and then he was vi&s;ited with a &s;udden pang; but it was no &s;ooner felt, than he &s;eemed to ri&s;e above it, and &s;miled at the impo|tence of the attack. Three or four times he was bedewed with profu&s;e &s;weats, and the&s;e again were &s;ucceeded by an extreme dryne&s;s and burning heat of the &s;kin. He was next covered with &s;mall livid &s;pots. Symptoms of &s;hivering followed, but the&s;e he drove away with a determined re&s;olution. He then became tranquil and compo&s;ed, and after &s;ome time determined to go to bed, it being al|ready night. Falkland, &s;aid he, pre&s;&s;ing his hand, the ta&s;k of dying is not &s;o difficult, as &s;ome people imagine. When one looks back from the brink of it, one wonders that &s;o total a &s;ubver&s;ion can take place at &s;o ea&s;y a rate.</P>
<P>He had now been &s;ome time in bed, and, as every thing was &s;till, Mr. Falkland hoped that he &s;lept. But in that he was mi&s;taken. Pre&s;ently Mr. Clare threw back the curtain, and looked in
<PB N="46" REF="028752_0048_0FDBEF8E172DE238">
the countenance of his friend. I cannot &s;leep, &s;aid he. No, if I could &s;leep, it would be the &s;ame thing as to recover; and I am fated to have the wor&s;t in this battle.</P>
<P>Falkland, I have been thinking about you. I do not know any one who&s;e future u&s;efulne&s;s I con|template with greater hope. Take care of your|&s;elf. Do not let the world be defrauded of the benefit of your virtues. I am well acquainted with your weakne&s;s as well as your &s;trength. You have an impetuo&s;ity and an impatience of imagined di&s;honour, that, if once &s;et wrong, may make you as eminently mi&s;chievous, as you will otherwi&s;e be u&s;eful. Would to God you would think &s;eriou&s;ly of exterminating this error!</P>
<P>But, if I cannot, in the brief expo&s;tulation my pre&s;ent &s;ituation will allow, work this de&s;irable change in you, there is at lea&s;t one thing I can do. I can put you upon your guard again&s;t a mi&s;chief I fore&s;ee to be imminent. Beware of Mr. Tyrrel. Do not commit the mi&s;take of de&s;pi&s;ing him as an unequal opponent. Petty cau&s;es may produce great mi&s;chiefs. Mr. Tyrrel is boi&s;terous, rugged and unfeeling; and you are too pa&s;&s;ionate, too acutely &s;en&s;ible of injury. It would be truly to be lamented, if a man &s;o inferior, &s;o utterly unwor|thy to be compared with you, &s;hould be capable of changing your whole hi&s;tory into mi&s;ery and guilt. Think of this. I exact no promi&s;e from you. I would not &s;hackle you with the fetters of &s;uper|&s;tition; I would have you be governed by rea&s;on and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland was deeply affected with this ex|po&s;tulation. His &s;en&s;e of the generous attention of Mr. Clare at &s;uch a moment as this, was &s;o great as almo&s;t to deprive him of utterance. He &s;poke in &s;hort &s;entences and with vi&s;ible effort. I will behave better, replied he. Never fear me! Your
<PB N="47" REF="028752_0049_0FDBEFD25A458660">
kind admonitions &s;hall not be thrown away upon me.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare adverted to another &s;ubject. I have made you my executor; you will not refu&s;e me this la&s;t office of friend&s;hip. It is but a &s;hort time that I have had the happine&s;s of knowing you; but in that &s;hort time I have examined you well, and &s;een you thoroughly. Do not di&s;appoint the &s;anguine hope I have entertained!</P>
<P>I have left &s;ome legacies. My former connec|tions, while I lived amid&s;t the bu&s;y haunts of men, as many of them as were intimate, are all of them dear to me. I have not had time to &s;ummon them about me upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, nor did I de|&s;ire it. The remembrances of me will, I hope, an&s;wer a better purpo&s;e than &s;uch as are u&s;ually thought of on &s;imilar occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Mr. Clare, having thus unburthened his mind, &s;poke no more for &s;everal hours. Towards morn|ing Mr. Falkland quietly withdrew the curtain, and looked at the dying man. His eyes were open, and were now gently turned towards his young friend. His countenance was &s;unk, and of a death|like appearance. I hope you are better, &s;aid Falk|land in a half-whi&s;per, as if afraid of di&s;turbing him. Mr. Clare drew his hand from the bed|clothes, and &s;tretched it forward; Mr. Falkland advanced, and took hold of it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Much better, &s;aid Mr. Clare in a voice, inward and hardly articulate: the &s;truggle is now over; I have fini&s;hed my part: farewel; remember! The&s;e were his la&s;t words. He lived &s;till a few hours; his lips were &s;ometimes &s;een to move; he expired without a groan</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland had witne&s;&s;ed the &s;cene with much anxiety. His hopes of a favourable cri&s;is, and his fear of di&s;turbing the la&s;t moments of his friend, had held him dumb. For the la&s;t half hour he had &s;tood up with his eyes intently fixed upon Mr.
<PB N="48" REF="028752_0050_0FDBEF9366046430">
Clare. He witne&s;&s;ed the la&s;t ga&s;p, the la&s;t little convul&s;ive motion of the frame. He continued to look; he &s;eemed &s;ometimes to imagine that he &s;aw life renewed. At length he could deceive him&s;elf no longer, and exclaimed with a di&s;tracted accent, And is this all? He would have thrown him&s;elf upon the body of his friend; the attendants with|held, and would have forced him into another apartment. But he &s;truggled from them, and hung fondly over the bed. Is this the end of genius, virtue and excellence? Is the luminary of the world thus for ever gone? Oh, ye&s;terday! ye&s;ter|day! Clare, why could not I have died in your &s;tead? Dreadful moment! Irreparable lo&s;s! Lo&s;t in the very maturity and vigour of his mind! Cut off from a u&s;efulne&s;s ten thou&s;and times greater than any he had already exhibited! Oh, his was a mind to have in&s;tructed &s;ages, and guided the moral world! This is all we have left of him! The eloquence of tho&s;e lips is gone! The ince&s;&s;ant activity of that heart is &s;till! The be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of men is gone, and the world is in&s;en&s;ible of its lo&s;s!</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel heard the intelligence of Mr. Clare's death with emotion, but of a very different kind. He avowed that he had not forgiven him his partial attachment to Falkland, and therefore could not recal his remembrance with kindne&s;s. But, if he could have overlooked his pa&s;t inju&s;tice, &s;ufficient care was taken to employ means to keep alive his re&s;entment. Falkland for&s;ooth attended him on his death-bed, as if nobody el&s;e was worthy to par|take of his confidential communications. But what was wor&s;t of all was this executor&s;hip. In every thing this pragmatical ra&s;cal throws me behind. Contemptible wretch, that has nothing of the man about him! Mu&s;t he perpetually trample on his betters? Is every body incapable of rea&s;on, and
<PB N="49" REF="028752_0051_0FDBEFD40F9B4CE0">
making a right e&s;timate of the merits of men? caught with mere out&s;ide? choo&s;ing the flim&s;y be|fore the &s;ub&s;tantial? And upon his death-bed too! [Mr. Tyrrel with his uncultivated brutality mixed, as u&s;ually happens, certain rude notions of reli|gion.] Sure the &s;en&s;e of his &s;ituation might have &s;hamed him. Poor wretch! his &s;oul has a great deal to an&s;wer for. He has made my pillow un|ea&s;y; and whatever may be the con&s;equences, it is him we have to thank for them.</P>
<P>The death of Mr. Clare removed the per&s;on who could mo&s;t effectually have moderated the animo&s;i|ties of the contending parties, and took away the great operative check upon the exce&s;&s;es of Mr. Tyrrel. This ru&s;tic tyrant had been held in invo|luntary re&s;traint by the intellectual a&s;cendancy of his celebrated neighbour; and, notwith&s;tanding the general ferocity of his temper, did not appear till lately to have entertained a hatred again&s;t him. In the &s;hort time that had elap&s;ed from the period in which Mr. Clare had fixed his re&s;idence in the neighbourhood to that of the arrival of Mr. Falk|land from the Continent, the conduct of Mr. Tyrrel had even &s;hown certain tokens of improvement. Such was the felicity of Mr. Clare's manners that, even while he corrected, he conciliated, and ex|cited no angry emotions in tho&s;e who&s;e actions were mo&s;t curbed by the apprehen&s;ion of his di&s;|plea&s;ure. The effects of his &s;uavity however, &s;o far as related to Mr. Tyrrel, had been in a certain degree &s;u&s;pended by con&s;iderations of rival&s;hip be|tween this gentleman and Mr. Falkland. And, now that the influence of Mr. Clare's pre&s;ence and virtues were entirely removed, Mr. Tyrrel's temper broke out into more criminal exce&s;&s;es than at any former period, having the additional &s;timulus of mortified pride and di&s;appointed ambition.</P>

<P>THE con&s;equences of all this &s;peedily manife&s;t|ed them&s;elves. The very next incident in the &s;tory was in &s;ome degree deci&s;ive of the cata&s;trophe. Hitherto I have &s;poken only of preliminary matters, &s;eemingly unconnected with each other, though leading to that &s;tate of mind in both parties, which had &s;uch fatal effects. But all that remains is ra|pid and tremendous. The death-dealing mi&s;chief advances with an accelerated motion, appearing to defy human wi&s;dom and human &s;trength to ob|&s;truct its operation.</P>
<P>There was a tenant of Mr. Tyrrel, one Hawk|ins;&mdash;I cannot mention his name without recol|lecting the painful tragedies that are annexed to it! This Hawkins had originally been taken up by Mr. Tyrrel with a view of protecting him from the arbitrary proceedings of a neighbouring &s;quire, though he had now in his turn become an object of per&s;ecution to Mr. Tyrrel him&s;elf. The fir&s;t ground of their connection was this. Hawkins, be&s;ide a farm which he rented under the above|mentioned &s;quire, had a &s;mall freehold e&s;tate that he inherited from his father. This of cour&s;e en|titled him to a vote in the county elections; and, a warmly conte&s;ted election having occurred, he was required by his landlord to vote for the candi|date in who&s;e favour he had him&s;elf engaged. Hawkins refu&s;ed to obey the mandate, and &s;oon after received notice to quit the farm he at that time rented.</P>
<P>It happened that Mr. Tyrrel had intere&s;ted him|&s;elf &s;trongly in behalf of the oppo&s;ite candidate;
<PB N="51" REF="028752_0053_0FDBEFD75FEB5B30">
and, as Mr. Tyrrel's e&s;tate bordered upon the &s;eat of Hawkins's re&s;idence, the ejected countryman could think of no better expedient than that of riding over to this gentleman's man&s;ion, and re|lating the ca&s;e to him. Mr. Tyrrel heard him through with attention. Well, friend, &s;aid he, it is very true that I wi&s;hed Mr. Jackman to carry his election; but you know it is u&s;ual in the&s;e ca&s;es for tenants to vote ju&s;t as their landlords plea&s;e. I do not think proper to encourage rebellion.&mdash;All that is very right, and plea&s;e you, replied Hawkins; and I would have voted at my landlord's bidding for any other man in the three kingdoms but &s;quire Marlow. You mu&s;t know one day his hunt&s;man rode over my fence, and &s;o through my be&s;t field of &s;tanding corn. It was not above a dozen yards about, if he had kept the cart-road. The fellow had &s;erved me the &s;ame &s;auce, an it plea&s;e your honour, three or four times before. So I only a&s;ked him, What he did that for, and whether he had not more con&s;cience than to &s;poil people's crops a' that fa&s;hion? Pre&s;ently the &s;quire came up. He is but a poor, weazen-face chicken of a gentleman, &s;aving your honour's reverence. And &s;o he flew into a woundy pa&s;&s;ion, and threatened to hor&s;ewhip me. I will do as much in rea&s;on to plea&s;ure my landlord as arr a tenant he has; but I will not give my vote to a man that threatens to hor&s;ewhip me. And &s;o, your honour, I and my wife and three children are to be turned out of hou&s;e and home, and what I am to do to maintain them God knows. I have been a hard-working man, and have always lived very well, and I do think the ca&s;e is main hard. Squire Underwood turns me out of my farm; and, if your honour do not take me in, I know none of the neighbour|ing gentry will, for fear as they &s;ay of encouraging their own tenants to run ru&s;ty too.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="028752_0054_0FDBEF9A14C69E68">
This repre&s;entation was not without its effect upon Mr. Tyrrel. Well, well, man, replied he, we will &s;ee what can be done. Order and &s;ubor|dination are very good things; but people &s;hould know how much to require. As you tell the &s;tory, I cannot &s;ee that you are greatly to blame. Marlow is a coxcombical prig, that is the truth on't; and, if a man will expo&s;e him&s;elf, why, he mu&s;t even take what follows. I do hate a Frenchified fop with all my &s;oul; and I cannot &s;ay that I am much plea&s;ed with Mr. Underwood for taking the part of &s;uch a ra&s;cal. Hawkins, I think is your name? You may call on Barnes, my &s;teward, to-morrow, and he &s;hall &s;peak to you.</P>
<P>While Mr. Tyrrel was &s;peaking, he recollected that he had a farm vacant of nearly the &s;ame va|lue as that which Hawkins at pre&s;ent rented under Mr. Underwood. He immediately con&s;ulted his &s;teward, and, finding the thing &s;uitable in every re&s;pect, Hawkins was admitted out of hand into the catalogue of Mr. Tyrrel's tenants. Mr. Un|derwood extremely re&s;ented this proceeding, which indeed, as being contrary to the under&s;tood con|ventions of the country gentlemen, few people but Mr. Tyrrel would have ventured upon. He &s;aid that there was an end to all regulation, if tenants were to be encouraged in &s;uch inexcu&s;able di&s;obe|dience. It was not a que&s;tion of this or that can|didate, &s;eeing that any gentleman, who was a true friend to his country, would rather lo&s;e his elec|tion, than do a thing which if once e&s;tabli&s;hed into a practice, would deprive them for ever of the power of managing any election. The labouring people were &s;turdy and re&s;olute enough of their own accord; it became every day mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> difficult to keep them under any &s;ubordinations and, if the gentlemen were &s;o ill-advi&s;ed as to neglect the pub|lic
<PB N="53" REF="028752_0055_0FDBEFD859B782E8">
good, and encourage them in their in&s;olence, there was no fore&s;eeing where it would end.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel was not of a &s;tamp to be influenced by the&s;e remon&s;trances. Their general &s;pirit was &s;ufficiently conformable to the &s;entiments he him|&s;elf entertained; but he was of too vehement a temper to maintain the character of a con&s;i&s;tent politician; and, however wrong his conduct might be, he would by no means admit of its being &s;et right by the &s;ugge&s;tions of others. The more his patronage of Hawkins was critici&s;ed, the more in|flexibly he adhered to it; and he was at no lo&s;s in clubs and other a&s;&s;emblies to overbear and &s;ilence, if not to confute his cen&s;urers. Be&s;ide which, Hawkins had certain accompli&s;hments which qua|lified him to be a favourite with Mr. Tyrrel. The bluntne&s;s of his manner and the ruggedne&s;s of his temper gave him &s;ome re&s;emblance to his landlord; and, as the&s;e qualities were likely to be more fre|quently exerci&s;ed on &s;uch per&s;ons as had incurred Mr. Tyrrel's di&s;plea&s;ure than upon Mr. Tyrrel him|&s;elf, they were not ob&s;erved without &s;ome degree of complacency. In a word, he every day receiv|ed new marks of di&s;tinction from his patron, and after &s;ome time was appointed coadjutor to Mr. Barnes in the capacity of bailiff. It was about the &s;ame period that he obtained a lea&s;e of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">arm of which he was tenant.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel was determined, as occa&s;ion offered, to promote every part of the family of this favour|ed dependent. Hawkins had a &s;on, a lad of &s;e|venteen, of a very agreeable per&s;on, a ruddy com|plexion, and of quick and lively parts. This lad was in an uncommon degree the favourite of his father, who &s;eemed to have nothing &s;o much at heart as the future welfare of his &s;on. Mr. Tyrrel had noticed him two or three times with approba|tion; and the boy, being fond of the &s;ports of the
<PB N="54" REF="028752_0056_0FDBEF9EC2123278">
field, had occa&s;ionally followed the hounds, and di&s;played various in&s;tances both of agility and &s;aga|city in pre&s;ence of the &s;quire. One day in parti|cular he exhibited him&s;elf with uncommon advan|tage; and Mr. Tyrrel without farther delay propo|&s;ed to his father to take him into his family, and make him whipper-in to his hounds, till he could provide him with &s;ome more lucrative appointment in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al was received by Hawkins with various marks of mortification. He excu&s;ed him|&s;elf with he&s;itation for not accepting the offered favour; &s;aid the lad was in many ways u&s;eful to him; and hoped his honour would not in&s;i&s;t upon depriving him of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This apology might perhaps have been &s;ufficient with any other man than Mr. Tyrrel; but it was frequently ob&s;erv|ed of this gentleman that, when he had once form|ed a determination however &s;light in favour of any mea&s;ure, he was never afterwards known to give it up, and that the only effect of oppo&s;ition was to make him eager and inflexible in pur&s;uit of that to which he had before been nearly indifferent. At fir&s;t he &s;eemed to receive the apology of Hawkins with good humour, and to &s;ee nothing in it but what was rea&s;onable; but afterwards every time he &s;aw the boy his de&s;ire of retaining him in his &s;ervice was increa&s;ed, and he more than once re|peated to his father the good di&s;po&s;ition in which he felt him&s;elf towards him. At length he ob&s;erv|ed that the lad was no more to be &s;een mingling in his favourite &s;ports, and he began to &s;u&s;pect that this originated in a determination to thwart him in his projects.</P>
<P>Rou&s;ed by this &s;u&s;picion, which was not of a nature with Mr. Tyrrel to brook a delay, he &s;ent for Hawkins to confer with him. Hawkins, &s;aid he, in a tone of di&s;plea&s;ure, I am not &s;atisfied with
<PB N="55" REF="028752_0057_0FDBEFD9D2D37928">
you. I have &s;poken to you two or three times about this lad of yours, whom I am de&s;irous of taking into favour. What is the rea&s;on, &s;ir, that you &s;eem unthankful and aver&s;e to my kindne&s;s? You ought to know that I am not to be trifled with. I &s;hall not be contented, when I offer my favours to have them rejected by &s;uch fellows as you. I made you what you are; and, if I plea&s;e, can make you more helple&s;s and mi&s;erable than you were when I found you. Have a care!</P>
<P>An it plea&s;e your honour, &s;aid Hawkins, you have been a very good ma&s;ter to me, and I will tell you the whole truth. I hope you will na be angry. This lad is my favourite, my comfort and the &s;tay of my age.</P>
<P>Well, and what then? Is that a rea&s;on you &s;hould hinder his preferment?</P>
<P>Nay, pray your honour, hear me. I may be very weak for aught I know in this ca&s;e, but I cannot help it. My father was a clergyman. We have all of us lived in a creditable way; and I cannot bear to think that this poor lad of mine &s;hould go to &s;ervice. For my part, I do not &s;ee any good that comes of &s;ervants. God forgive me, if I am unju&s;t! But this is a very dear ca&s;e, and I cannot bear to ri&s;k my poor boy's welfare, when I can &s;o ea&s;ily, if you plea&s;e, keep him out of harm's way. At pre&s;ent he is &s;ober and indu&s;|trious, and, without being conceited or &s;urly, knows what is due to him. I know, your honour, that it is main fooli&s;h of me to talk to you thus; but your honour has been a good ma&s;ter to me, and I cannot bear to tell you a lie.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel had heard the whole of this harangue in &s;ilence, becau&s;e he was too much a&s;toni&s;hed to open his mouth. If a thunderbolt had fallen un|expectedly at his feet, he could not have te&s;tified greater &s;urpri&s;e. He had thought that Hawkins
<PB N="56" REF="028752_0058_0FDBEFA0160F7218">
was &s;o fooli&s;hly fond of his &s;on that he could not bear to tru&s;t him out of his pre&s;ence, but had never in the &s;lighte&s;t degree &s;u&s;pected what he now found to be the truth.</P>
<P>Oh, oh, you are a gentleman, are you? A pretty gentleman truly! Your father was a cler|gyman! Your family is too good to enter into my &s;ervice! Why, you impudent ra&s;cal! was it for this that I took you up, when Mr. Underwood di&s;mi&s;&s;ed you for your in&s;olence to him? Have I been nur&s;ing a viper in my bo&s;om? Pretty ma&s;|ter's manners will be contaminated truly! He will not know what is due to him, but will be ac|cu&s;tomed to obey orders! You in&s;ufferable vil|lain! Get out of my &s;ight! Depend upon it, I will have no gentlemen on my e&s;tate! I will off with them, root and branch, bag and baggage! So, do you hear, &s;ir? come to me to-morrow morning, bring your &s;on, and a&s;k my pardon; or take my word for it, I will make you &s;o mi&s;erable, you &s;hall wi&s;h you had never been born</P>
<P>This treatment was too much for Hawkins's patience. There is no need, your honour, that I &s;hould come to you again about this affair. I have taken up my determination, and no accident or time can make any change in it. I am main &s;orry to di&s;plea&s;e your wor&s;hip, and I know very well that you can do me a great deal of mi&s;chief. But I hope you will not be &s;o hard hearted, as to ruin a father only for being fond of his child, even if &s;o be that his fondne&s;s &s;hould make him do a fooli&s;h thing. But I cannot help it, your honour: you mu&s;t do as you plea&s;e. The poore&s;t &s;lave in the world has &s;ome point that he does not part with. I will lo&s;e all that I have, and go to day-labour, and my &s;on too, if needs mu&s;t; but I will not make a gentleman's &s;ervant of him.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="028752_0059_0FDBEFDEB3932BB8">
Very well, friend; very well! replied Tyrrel, foaming with rage. Depend upon it, I will re|member you! Your pride &s;hall have a downfal! G&mdash;damn it! is it come to this? Shall a lou&s;y ra&s;cal, that farms his forty acres, pretend to beard the lord of the manor? I will tread you into pa&s;te! Let me advi&s;e you, &s;coundrel, to &s;hut up your hou&s;e, and quit my e&s;tate, and fly as if the devil was behind you! You may think your&s;elf happy, if I be not too quick for you yet, if you e&s;cape in a whole &s;kin! I would not &s;uffer &s;uch a villain to remain upon my land a day longer, if I could gain the Indies by it!</P>
<P>Not &s;o fa&s;t, your honour, an&s;wered Hawkins &s;turdily. I hope you will think better of it, and &s;ee that I have not been to blame. But, if you &s;hould not, there is &s;ome harm that you can do me, and &s;ome harm that you cannot. Though I am a plain working man, your honour, do you &s;ee? yet I am a man &s;till. No; I have got a lea&s;e of my farm, and I &s;hall not quit it o'thaten. I hope there is &s;ome law for poor folk, as well as for rich ones.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, unu&s;ed to contradiction, was pro|voked beyond bearing at the courage and indepen|dent &s;pirit of his retainer. There was not a tenant upon his e&s;tate, or at lea&s;t not one of Hawkins's mediocrity of fortune, whom the general policy of land-owners, and &s;till more the arbitrary and un|controulable temper of Mr. Tyrrel, did not effectu|ally re&s;train from acts of open defiance.</P>
<P>Excellent, upon my &s;oul! G&mdash;damn my blood! but you are a rare fellow. You have a lea&s;e, have you? You will not quit, not you! A pretty pa&s;s things are come to, if a lea&s;e can protect &s;uch fel|lows as you again&s;t the lord of a manor! But you are for a trial of &s;kill, are you? Oh, very well, friend, very well! With all my &s;oul! Since it is
<PB N="58" REF="028752_0060_0FDBEFA1646F4540">
come to that, we will &s;how you &s;ome pretty &s;port before we have done! But get you out of my &s;ight, you ra&s;cal! I have not another word to &s;ay to you! Never darken my doors again!</P>
<P>Hawkins, to borrow the language of the world, was guilty in this affair of a double imprudence. He talked to his landlord in a more peremptory manner than the con&s;titution and practices of this country allow a dependent to a&s;&s;ume. But above all, having been thus hurried away by his re&s;ent|ment, he ought to have fore&s;een the con&s;equences. It was mere madne&s;s in him to think of conte&s;ting with a man of Mr. Tyrrel's eminence and fortune. It was a fawn contending with a lion. Nothing could have been more ea&s;y to predict, than that it was of no avail for him to have right on his &s;ide, when his adver&s;ary had influence and wealth, and therefore could &s;o victoriou&s;ly ju&s;tify any extrava|gancies that he might think proper to commit. This maxim was completely illu&s;trated in the &s;equel. Wealth and de&s;poti&s;m ea&s;ily know how to engage tho&s;e laws, which were perhaps at fir&s;t in|tended [witle&s;s and mi&s;erable precaution!] for the &s;afeguards of the poor, as the coadjutors of their oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>From this moment Mr. Tyrrel was bent upon Hawkins's de&s;truction; and he left no means un|employed that could either hara&s;s or injure the ob|ject of his per&s;ecution. He deprived him of his appointment of bailiff, and directed Barnes and his other dependents to do him ill offices upon all occa&s;ions. Mr. Tyrrel by the tenure of his manor was impropriator of the great tithes, and this cir|cum&s;tance afforded him frequent opportunities of petty altercation. The land of one part of Haw|kins's farm, though covered with corn, was lower than the re&s;t; and con&s;equently expo&s;ed to occa|&s;ional inundations from a river by which it was
<PB N="59" REF="028752_0061_0FDBEFDFE2AAD8F0">
bounded. Mr. Tyrrel had a dam belonging to this river privately cut about a fortnight before the &s;ea|&s;on of harve&s;t, and laid the whole under water. He ordered his &s;ervants to pull away the fences of the higher ground during the night, and to turn in his cattle to the utter de&s;truction of the crop. The&s;e expedients however applied to only one part of the property of this unfortunate man. But Mr. Tyrrel did not &s;top here. A &s;udden morta|lity took place among Hawkins's live &s;tock, at|tended with very &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances. Haw|kins's vigilance was &s;trongly excited by this event, and he at length &s;ucceeded in tracing the matter &s;o accurately that he conceived he could bring it home to Mr. Tyrrel him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Hawkins had hitherto carefully avoided, not|with&s;tanding the injuries he had &s;uffered, attempt|ing to right him&s;elf by a legal proce&s;s, being of opinion that law was better adapted for a weapon of tyranny in the hands of the rich, than for a &s;hield to protect the humbler part of the commu|nity again&s;t their u&s;urpations. In this la&s;t in&s;tance however he conceived that the offence was &s;o atro|cious as to make it impo&s;&s;ible that any rank could protect the culprit again&s;t the &s;everity of ju&s;tice. In the &s;equel he &s;aw rea&s;on to applaud him&s;elf for his former inactivity in this re&s;pect, and to repent that any motive had been &s;trong enough to per|&s;uade him into a contrary &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>This was the very point to which Mr. Tyrrel wanted to bring him, and he could &s;carcely credit his good fortune, when he was told that Hawkins had entered an action. His congratulation upon this occa&s;ion was immoderate, as he now conceived that the ruin of his late favourite was irretrievable. He con&s;ulted his attorney, and urged him by every motive he could devi&s;e to employ the whole &s;eries of his &s;ubterfuges in the pre&s;ent affair. The direct re|pelling
<PB N="60" REF="028752_0062_0FDBEFA46536A450">
of the charge exhibited again&s;t him was the lea&s;t part of his care; the bu&s;ine&s;s was, by affida|vits, motions, pleas, demurrers, flaws and appeals, to protract the que&s;tion from term to term and from court to court. It would, as Mr. Tyrrel ar|gued, be the di&s;grace of a civilized country, if a gentleman, when in&s;olently attacked in law by the &s;cum of the earth, could not convert the cau&s;e into a que&s;tion of the longe&s;t pur&s;e, and &s;tick in the &s;kirts of his adver&s;ary till he had reduced him to beggary.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel however was by no means &s;o far en|gro&s;&s;ed by his law-&s;uit, as to neglect other methods of proceeding offen&s;ively again&s;t his tenant. Among the various expedients that &s;ugge&s;ted them&s;elves there was one, which, though it tended rather to torment than irreparably injure the &s;ufferer, was not rejected. This was derived from the particu|lar &s;ituation of Hawkins's hou&s;e, barns, &s;tacks and out-hou&s;es. The&s;e were placed at the extremity of a &s;trip of land connecting them with the re&s;t of the farm, and were &s;urrounded on three &s;ides by fields in the occupation of one of Mr Tyrrel's tenants mo&s;t devoted to the plea&s;ures of the land|lord. The road to the market town ran at the bottom of the large&s;t of the&s;e fields, and was di|rectly in view of the front of the hou&s;e. No in|convenience had yet ari&s;en from that circum&s;tance, as there had been a broad path time out of mind, that inter&s;ected this field, and led directly from Hawkins's hou&s;e to the road. This path, or pri|vate road, was now by concert of Mr. Tyrrel and his obliging tenant &s;hut up, &s;o as to make Hawkins a &s;ort of pri&s;oner in his own domains, and oblige him to go near a mile about for the purpo&s;es of his traffic.</P>
<P>Young Hawkins, the lad who had been the original &s;ubject of di&s;pute between his father and
<PB N="61" REF="028752_0063_0FDBEFE5DA468448">
the &s;quire, had much of his father's &s;pirit, and felt an uncontroulable indignation again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive acts of de&s;poti&s;m of which he was a witne&s;s. His re&s;entment of them was the greater, becau&s;e the &s;ufferings to which his parent was expo&s;ed, all of them, flowed from affection to him, at the &s;ame time that he could not propo&s;e removing the ground of di&s;pute, as by &s;o doing he would &s;eem to fly in the face of his father's paternal kindne&s;s. Upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, without a&s;king any coun&s;el but of his own impatient re&s;entment, he went in the middle of the night and removed all the ob|&s;tructions that had been placed in the way of the old path, broke the padlocks that had been fixed, and threw open the gates. In the&s;e operations he did not proceed unob&s;erved, and the next day a warrant was i&s;&s;ued for apprehending him. He was accordingly carried before a bench of ju&s;tices, and by them committed to the county jail, to take his trial for the burglary at the next a&s;&s;izes.</P>
<P>This was the fini&s;hing &s;troke to Hawkins's mi|&s;eries: as he was not deficient in courage, he had &s;tood up again&s;t his other per&s;ecutions without flinching. He was not unaware of the advantages which our laws and cu&s;toms give to the rich over the poor in contentions of this kind. But, being once involved, there was a &s;tubbornne&s;s in his na|ture that would not allow him to retract, and he &s;uffered him&s;elf to hope rather than expect a fa|vourable i&s;&s;ue. But in this la&s;t event he was wounded in the point that was neare&s;t his heart. He had feared to have his &s;on contaminated and deba&s;ed by a &s;ervile &s;tation, and he now &s;aw him transferred to the &s;eminary of a jail. He was even uncertain as to the i&s;&s;ue of his impri&s;onment, and trembled to think what the tyranny of wealth might effect to bla&s;t his hopes for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="028752_0064_0FDBEFA554090358">
From this moment his heart died within him. He had tru&s;ted to per&s;evering indu&s;try and &s;kill to &s;ave the wreck of his little property from the vul|gar &s;pite of his landlord. But he had now no lon|ger any &s;pirit to exert tho&s;e efforts which his &s;itu|ation more than ever required. Mr. Tyrrel pro|ceeded without remi&s;&s;ion in his machinations; Hawkins's affairs every day grew more de&s;perate; and the &s;quire, watching the occa&s;ion, took the earlie&s;t opportunity of &s;eizing upon his remaining property in the mode of a di&s;tre&s;s for rent.</P>
<P>It was preci&s;ely in this &s;tage of the affair that Mr. Falkland and Mr. Tyrrel accidentally met in a private road near the habitation of the latter. They were on hor&s;eback, and Mr. Falkland was going to the hou&s;e of the unfortunate tenant who &s;eemed upon the point of peri&s;hing under his land|lord's malice. He had been ju&s;t made acquainted with the tale of this per&s;ecution. It had indeed been an additional aggravation of Hawkins's cala|mity that Mr. Falkland, who&s;e interference might otherwi&s;e have &s;aved him, had been ab&s;ent from the neighbourhood for a con&s;iderable time. He had been three months in London, and from thence had gone to vi&s;it his e&s;tates in another part of the i&s;land. The proud and &s;elf-confident &s;pirit of this poor fellow always di&s;po&s;ed him to depend as long as po&s;&s;ible upon his own exertions. He had avoided applying to Mr. Falkland, or indeed indulging him&s;elf in any manner in communicating and be|wailing his hard hap, in the beginning of the con|tention; and, when the extremity grew more urgent, and he would have been willing to recede in &s;ome degree from the &s;tubbornne&s;s of his mea|&s;ures, he found it no longer in his power. After an ab&s;ence of con&s;iderable duration Mr. Falkland at length returned &s;omewhat unexpectedly; and, having learned among the fir&s;t articles of country
<PB N="63" REF="028752_0065_0FDBEFE6972AAA00">
intelligence the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of this unfortunate yeo|man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e re&s;olved to ride over to his hou&s;e the next morning, and &s;urprize him with all the relief it was in his power to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>At &s;ight of Mr. Tyrrel in this unexpected ren|counter, his face reddened with indignation. His fir&s;t feeling, as he afterwards &s;aid, was to avoid him; but, finding that he mu&s;t pa&s;s him, he con|ceived that it would be a want of &s;pirit and de&s;er|tion of duty not to acquaint him with his feelings on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, &s;aid he &s;omewhat abruptly, I am &s;orry for a piece of news which it has ju&s;t been my fortune to hear.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ir, and what is that? What have I to do with your &s;orrow?</P>
<P>A great deal, &s;ir. It is cau&s;ed by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a poor tenant of your's, Hawkins. If your &s;teward have proceeded without your authority, I think it right to inform you of what he has done; and, if he has had your authority, I would gladly per&s;uade you to think better of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland, it would be quite as well if you would mind your own bu&s;ine&s;s, and leave me to mind mine. I want no monitor, and I will have none.</P>
<P>You mi&s;take, Mr. Tyrrel; I am minding my own bu&s;ine&s;s. If I &s;ee you fall into a pit, it is my bu&s;ine&s;s to draw you out, and &s;ave your life. If I &s;ee you pur&s;uing a wrong line of conduct, it is my bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;et you right and &s;ave your honour.</P>
<P>Zounds, &s;ir, do not think to put any of your conundrums upon me! Is not the man my tenant? Is not my e&s;tate my own? What &s;ignifies calling it mine, if I am not to have the direction of it? Sir, I pay for what I have; I owe no man a penny; and I will not put my e&s;tate to nur&s;e to you, nor the be&s;t he that wears a head.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="028752_0066_0FDBEFA6D4C254C0">
Mr. Tyrrel, I do not di&s;pute your authority; I do not de&s;ire to dictate to you; I &s;imply wi&s;h to do you a good office.</P>

<P>Sir, I know that you bear me no good will. I am but an ill mediator in this ca&s;e, and &s;hould not have &s;ought you. But, thus thru&s;t by acci|dent in your way, I mu&s;t have leave to tell you my thoughts.</P>
<P>True, &s;ir, I hate you. And what I hate you mo&s;t for is this damned impertinence of pretending to be wi&s;er than every body el&s;e. Is not this a free country, and may not every body do as he likes?</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, I know your humour, and will bear as much as I can. What do you mean, &s;ir, by a free country? I put no compul&s;ion upon you. There is room enough; ride by me, if you plea&s;e! Sir, I defy you not to hear me, while I tell you coolly and firmly, you are greatly to blame, and mu&s;t change your mode of proceeding!</P>
<P>This is very extraordinary u&s;age! Sir, I am not to blame. You know nothing about the matter. Do you think I will let a paltry fellow like this Hawkins in&s;ult me for nothing? Damn my &s;oul, if I will not have the heart's blood of him!</P>
<P>It is very true, Mr. Tyrrel, that there is a di&s;|tinction of ranks. I believe that di&s;tinction to be a good thing. But, however nece&s;&s;ary it may be, we mu&s;t acknowledge that it puts &s;ome hard&s;hips upon the lower orders of &s;ociety. It makes one's heart ache to think that one man is born to the inherit|ance of every &s;uperfluity, while the whole &s;hare of another, without any demerit of his, is drud|gery and &s;tarving; and that all this is indi&s;pen&s;able. We that are rich, Mr. Tyrrel, mu&s;t do every thing in our power to lighten the yoke of the&s;e unfor|tunate
<PB N="65" REF="028752_0067_0FDBEFECD798A640">
people. We mu&s;t not u&s;e the advantage that accident has given us, with an unmerciful hand. Poor wretches! they are pre&s;&s;ed almo&s;t be|yond bearing as it is; and if we unfeelingly give another turn to the machine, they will be cru&s;hed into atoms.</P>
<P>This picture was not without its effect even upon the obdurate mind of Mr. Tyrrel.&mdash;Well, &s;ir, I am no tyrant. I know very well that tyranny is a bad thing. But you do not infer from thence that the&s;e people are to do as they plea&s;e, and never to meet with their de&s;erts?</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel, I &s;ee that you are &s;haken in your animo&s;ity. Suffer me to hail the new-born bene|volence of your nature. Go with me to Hawkins. Do not let us talk of his de&s;erts! poor fellow! he has &s;uffered almo&s;t all that human nature can en|dure. Let your forgivene&s;s upon this occa&s;ion be the earne&s;t of good neighbourhood and friend&s;hip between you and me.</P>
<P>No, &s;ir, I will not go. I own there is &s;omething in what you &s;ay. I always knew you had the wit to make good your own &s;tory, and tell a plau&s;ible tale. But I will not be come over thus. It has always been my character, when I had once con|ceived a &s;cheme of vengeance never to forego it; and I will not change that character. I took up Hawkins when every body for&s;ook him, and made a man of him; and the ungrateful ra&s;cal has only in&s;ulted me for my pains. Cur&s;e me, if ever I forgive him! It would be a good je&s;t indeed, if I were to forgive the in&s;olence of my own creature, at the de&s;ire of a man like you that has been my perpetual plague.</P>
<P>For God's &s;ake, Mr. Tyrrel, have &s;ome rea&s;on in your re&s;entment! Let us &s;uppo&s;e that Hawkins has behaved unju&s;tifiably, and in&s;ulted you. Is that an offence that can never be expiated? Mu&s;t
<PB N="66" REF="028752_0068_0FDBEFAD0291A760">
the father be ruined, and the &s;on hanged, to glut your re&s;entment?</P>
<P>Damn me, &s;ir, but you may talk your heart out; you &s;hall get nothing of me. I &s;hall never forgive my&s;elf for having li&s;tened to you for a moment. I will &s;uffer nobody to &s;top the &s;tream of my re&s;ent|ment; if I ever were to forgive him, it &s;hould be at nobody's intreaty but my own. But, &s;ir, I never will. If he and all his family were at my feet, I would order them all to be hanged the next minute, if my power were as good as my will.</P>
<P>Very well, &s;ir, I have done. I have only to tell you beforehand that &s;uch tyranny as your's will make you the univer&s;al abhorrence of mankind. You may hug your&s;elf in your wealth and impu|nity, but be &s;ure the genuine &s;en&s;e of the world will pierce through all your intrenchments, and fully avenge tho&s;e for who&s;e blood you &s;o cruelly thir&s;t. Good day to you.</P>
<P>Such was the conference of Mr. Falkland and Mr. Tyrrel re&s;pecting this odious tran&s;action. In one part it &s;eemed to promi&s;e a more favourable i&s;&s;ue. But the rooted depravity of the one, and perhaps the haughty impatience of the other, &s;oon put an end to this agreeable pro&s;pect. For Mr. Tyrrel, the aver&s;ion he entertained for his accom|pli&s;hed neighbour hourly increa&s;ed. It &s;eemed as if, the more inconte&s;tibly his excellencies di&s;played them&s;elves, the more bitter and inexpiable was the abhorrence he conceived for him. Having &s;et out with contempt, and per&s;uaded him&s;elf of the un|pardonable inju&s;tice of tho&s;e by whom Mr. Falk|land was e&s;teemed, he was probably anxious to ex|clude the evidence of his worth; and, as that evi|dence went on to increa&s;e, the &s;truggle became more painful, and the &s;ituation more excruciating. In this re&s;pect the &s;tate of Mr. Tyrrel's mind was perhaps peculiarly critical; and, if we &s;hould allow
<PB N="67" REF="028752_0069_0FDBEFEED31139C0">
our&s;elves to judge from the appearances exhibited in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, we &s;hould be apt to lay it down as a &s;ort of general maxim, that the greate&s;t cri|minal, when he perpetrates the mo&s;t atrocious act, is upon the very eve of yielding to the energy of truth, and relinqui&s;hing for ever his odious de|&s;igns.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland departed from this conference with a confirmed di&s;approbation of the conduct of his neighbour, and an unalterable re&s;olution to do every thing in his power to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Hawkins. But he was too late. When he ar|rived, he found the hou&s;e already evacuated by its ma&s;ter. The family was removed nobody knew whither; Hawkins was ab&s;conded; and, what was &s;till more extraordinary, the boy Hawkins had e&s;caped on the very &s;ame day from the county jail. The enquiries Mr. Falkland &s;et on foot after them were fruitle&s;s; no traces could be found of the cata&s;trophe of the&s;e unhappy people. That cata&s;|trophe I &s;hall have occa&s;ion &s;hortly to relate; and it will be found pregnant with horror, beyond what the blacke&s;t mi&s;anthropy could readily have &s;ug|ge&s;ted.</P>
<P>I go on with my tale. I go on to relate tho&s;e incidents in which my own fate was &s;o my&s;teriou&s;ly involved. The temper of Mr. Tyrrel, &s;oured with perpetual di&s;appointment, became every day more peevi&s;h, arrogant and moro&s;e. The reader has &s;een what it was in the commencement. But every thing has its limits beyond which it can aug|ment no farther. I lift the curtain, and bring for|ward the la&s;t act of the tragedy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE vices of Mr. Tyrrel, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate of augmentation, were peculiarly exerci&s;ed upon his dome&s;tics and dependents. But the principal &s;ufferer was Mi&s;s Emily Melvile, the orphan daugh|ter of his father's &s;i&s;ter. Mi&s;s Melvile's mother had married unfortunately, or rather imprudently, again&s;t the con&s;ent of her relations, all of whom had agreed to withdraw their countenance from her in con&s;equence of that precipitate &s;tep. Her hu&s;band had turned out to be no better than an adventurer; had &s;pent her fortune, which in con|&s;equence of the irreconcilablene&s;s of her family was le&s;s than he expected, and broken her heart. Her infant daughter was left without any re&s;ource upon the wide world. In this &s;ituation the repre&s;enta|tions of the people with whom &s;he happened to be placed prevailed upon Mrs. Tyrrel, the mother of the &s;quire, to receive her into her family. In equity perhaps &s;he was entitled to that portion of fortune which her mother had for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eited by her im|prudence, and which had gone to &s;well the pro|perty of the male repre&s;entative. But this idea had never entered into the conceptions of either mother or &s;on. Mrs. Tyrrel conceived that &s;he performed an act of the mo&s;t exalted benevolence in admit|ting Mi&s;s Emily into a &s;ort of amphibious &s;ituation, which was neither preci&s;ely that of a dome&s;tic, nor yet marked with the treatment that might &s;eem due to one of the family.</P>
<P>She had not however at fir&s;t been &s;en&s;ible of all the mortifications that might have been expected
<PB N="69" REF="028752_0071_0FDBEFF469267838">
from her condition. Mrs. Tyrrel, though proud and imperious, was not ill-natured. The female, who lived in the family in the capacity of hou&s;e-keeper, was a per&s;on who had &s;een better days, and who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition was extremely upright and amiable. She early contracted a friend&s;hip for the little Emily, who was indeed for the mo&s;t part committed to her care. Emily on her &s;ide fully repaid the affection of her in&s;tructre&s;s, and learn|ed with great docility the little accompli&s;hments Mrs. Jakeman was able to communicate. But mo&s;t of all &s;he imbibed her chearful and artle&s;s temper, that extracted the agreeable and encouraging from all events, and prompted her to communicate her &s;entiments, which were never of the cynical ca&s;t, without modification or di&s;gui&s;e. Be&s;ide the ad|vantages Emily derived from Mrs. Jakeman, &s;he was permitted to take le&s;&s;ons from the ma&s;ters who came to Tyrrel Place for the in&s;truction of her cou&s;in; and, indeed, as the young gentleman was mo&s;t frequently indi&s;po&s;ed to attend to them, they would commonly have had nothing to do, had it not been for the fortunate pre&s;ence of Mi&s;s Melvile. Mrs. Tyrrel therefore encouraged the &s;tudies of Emily on that &s;core; in addition to which &s;he ima|gined that this living exhibition of in&s;truction might operate as an indirect allurement to her dar|ling Barnabas, the only &s;pecies of motive &s;he would &s;uffer to be pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Emily, as &s;he grew up, di&s;played an uncommon degree of &s;en&s;ibility, which under her circum&s;tan|ces would have been a &s;ource of perpetual di&s;&s;atis|faction, had it not been qualified with an extreme &s;weetne&s;s and ea&s;ine&s;s of temper. She was far from being entitled to the appellation of a beauty. Her per&s;on was <HI>petite</HI> and trivial; her complexion favoured of the <HI>brunette;</HI> and her face was marked with the &s;mall pox, &s;ufficiently to de&s;troy its even|ne&s;s
<PB N="70" REF="028752_0072_0FDBEFB1F73A2348">
and poli&s;h, though not enough to annihilate its expre&s;&s;ion. But, though her appearance was not beautiful, it did not fail to be in a high degree engaging. Her complexion was at once healthful and delicate; her long dark eye-brows adapted them&s;elves with facility to the various conceptions of her mind; and her looks bore the united im|pre&s;&s;ion of an active di&s;cernment and a good-hu|moured frankne&s;s. The in&s;truction &s;he had re|ceived, as it was entirely of a ca&s;ual nature, ex|empted her from the evils of untutored ignorance, but not from a &s;ort of native wildne&s;s, arguing a mind incapable of guile it&s;elf, or of &s;u&s;pecting it in others. She amu&s;ed, without &s;eeming con&s;cious of the refined &s;en&s;e which her ob&s;ervations con|tained: or rather having never been debauched with applau&s;e, &s;he &s;et light by her own qualifica|tions; and talked from the pure gaiety of a youth|ful heart acting upon the &s;tores of a ju&s;t under|&s;tanding, and not with any expectation of being di&s;tingui&s;hed and admired.</P>
<P>The death of her aunt made very little change in her &s;ituation. This prudent lady, who would have thought it little le&s;s than &s;acrilege to have con&s;ider|ed mi&s;s Melvile as a branch of the &s;tock of the Tyr|rels, took no other notice of her in her will, than barely putting her down for a hundred pounds in a catalogue of legacies to her &s;ervants. She had never been admitted into the intimacy and confi|dence of Mrs. Tyrrel; and the young &s;quire, now that &s;he was left under his &s;ole protection, &s;eemed inclined to treat her with even more liberality than his mother had done. He had &s;een her grow up under his eye, and therefore, though there were but &s;ix years difference between their ages, he felt a kind of paternal intere&s;t in her welfare. Habit had rendered her in a manner nece&s;&s;ary to him, and in every rece&s;s from the occupations of the
<PB N="71" REF="028752_0073_0FDBEFF654298F60">
field and the plea&s;ures of the table, he found him|&s;elf &s;olitary and forlorn without the &s;ociety of mi&s;s Melvile. Nearne&s;s of kindred and Emily's want of per&s;onal beauty prevented him from ever look|ing on her with the eyes of de&s;ire. Her accom|pli&s;hments were chiefly of the cu&s;tomary and &s;u|perficial kind, dancing and mu&s;ic. Her &s;kill in the fir&s;t led him &s;ometimes to indulge her with a va|cant corner in his carriage when he went to the neighbouring a&s;&s;embly; and, in whatever light he might him&s;elf think proper to regard her, he would have imagined his chambermaid, introduced by him, entitled to an undoubted place in the mo&s;t &s;plendid circle. Her mu&s;ical talents were frequent|ly employed for his amu&s;ement. She had the ho|nour occa&s;ionally of playing him to &s;leep after the fatigues of the chace; and as he had &s;ome reli&s;h for harmonious &s;ounds, &s;he was frequently able to &s;oothe him by their means from the perturbations of which his gloomy di&s;po&s;ition was &s;o eminently a &s;lave. Upon the whole &s;he might be con&s;idered as in &s;ome &s;ort his favourite. She was the media|tor to whom his tenants and dome&s;tics, when they had incurred his di&s;plea&s;ure, were accu&s;tom|ed to apply; the privileged companion that could handle this lion with impunity in the mid&s;t of his roarings. She &s;poke to him without fear; her &s;o|licitations were always good-natured and di&s;inte|re&s;ted; and when he repul&s;ed her, he di&s;armed him&s;elf of half his terrors, and was contented to &s;mile at her pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>Such had been for &s;ome years the &s;ituation of Mi&s;s Melvile. Its precariou&s;ne&s;s had been beguil|ed, by the chearfulne&s;s of her own temper, and the uncommon forbearance with which &s;he was treated by her &s;avage protector. But his di&s;po&s;i|tion, always brutal, had acquired a new degree of ferocity &s;ince the &s;ettlement of Mr. Falkland in his
<PB N="72" REF="028752_0074_0FDBEFB3941C1628">
neighbourhood. He occa&s;ionally forgot the gentle|ne&s;s with which he had been accu&s;tomed to treat his good-natured cou&s;in. Her little playful arts were not always &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;oftening his rage; and he would &s;ometimes turn upon her blandi&s;h|ment with an impatient &s;ternne&s;s that made her tremble. The carele&s;s ea&s;e of her di&s;po&s;ition how|ever &s;oon effaced the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, and &s;he fell without variation into her old habits.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance occurred about this time which put an end to the felicity, that mi&s;s Melvile in &s;pite of the frowns of fortune had hitherto enjoyed. Emily was exactly &s;eventeen when Mr. Falkland returned from the Continent. At this age &s;he was peculiarly &s;u&s;ceptible of the charms of beauty, grace and moral excellence, when united in a per&s;on of the other &s;ex. She was imprudent, preci&s;ely be|cau&s;e her own heart was incapable of guile. She had never yet felt the &s;ting of the poverty to which &s;he was condemned, and had not reflected on the in&s;uperable di&s;tance that fortune has placed be|tween the opulent and the poorer cla&s;&s;es of the community. She beheld Mr. Falkland, whenever he was thrown in her way at any of the public meetings with admiration; and, without having preci&s;ely explained to her&s;elf the &s;entiments &s;he indulged, her eyes followed him through all the changes of the &s;cene with eagerne&s;s and impa|tience. She did not &s;ee him, as the re&s;t of the a&s;&s;embly did, born to one of the ample&s;t e&s;tates in the county, and qualified to a&s;&s;ert his title to the rich|e&s;t heire&s;s. She thought only of Falkland, with tho&s;e advantages which were mo&s;t intimately his own, and of which no per&s;ecution of adver&s;e fortune had the ability to deprive him. In a word &s;he was tran&s;ported when he was pre&s;ent; he was the per|petual &s;ubject of her reveries and her dreams; but
<PB N="73" REF="028752_0075_0FDBEFFC11B003E0">
his image excited no &s;entiment in her mind beyond that of the immediate plea&s;ure annexed to the idea.</P>
<P>The notice Mr. Falkland had taken of her in re|turn appeared &s;ufficiently encouraging to a mind &s;o full of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as that of Emily. There was a particular complacency in his looks when direct|ed towards her. He had &s;aid in a company, of which one of the per&s;ons pre&s;ent repeated his re|marks to Mi&s;s Melvile, that &s;he appeared to him amiable and intere&s;ting, that he felt for her unpro|vided and de&s;titute &s;ituation, and that he &s;hould have been glad to be more particular in his notice of her, had he not been apprehen&s;ive of doing her a prejudice in the &s;u&s;picious mind of Mr. Tyrrel. All this &s;he treated as the ravi&s;hing conde&s;cen&s;ion of a &s;uperior nature; for, if &s;he did not recollect with &s;ufficient a&s;&s;iduity his gifts of fortune, &s;he was on the other hand filled with reverence for his unrivalled accompli&s;hments. But, while &s;he thus &s;eemingly di&s;claimed all compari&s;on between Mr. Falkland and her&s;elf, &s;he probably cheri&s;hed a con|fu&s;ed idea that &s;ome event was yet in the womb of fate which might reconcile things apparently the mo&s;t incompatible. Fraught with the&s;e prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, the civilities that had once or twice oc|curred in the bu&s;tle of a public circle, the re&s;tor|ing her fan which &s;he had dropped, or the di&s;com|moding her of an empty tea-cup, made her heart palpitate, and gave birth to the wilde&s;t chimeras in her deluded imagination.</P>
<P>About this time an event happened that helped to give a preci&s;e determination to the fluctuations of Mi&s;s Melvile's mind. One evening, a &s;hort time after the death of Mr. Clare, Mr. Falkland had been to the hou&s;e of his decea&s;ed friend in his quality of executor, and by &s;ome accidents of little intrin&s;ic importance had been detained three or
<PB N="74" REF="028752_0076_0FDBD6C1F69C54D8">
four hours later than he intended. He did not &s;et out upon his return till two o'clock in the morn|ing. At this time, in a &s;ituation &s;o remote from the metropolis, every thing is as &s;ilent as it would be in a region wholly uninhabited. The moon &s;hone bright, and the objects around, being mark|ed with &s;trong variations of light and &s;hade at the &s;ame time that they were not di&s;tinctly &s;een, gave a kind of &s;acred &s;olemnity to the &s;cene. Mr. Falk|land had taken Collins with him, the bu&s;ine&s;s to be &s;ettled at Mr. Clare's being in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;imilar to that to which this faithful dome&s;tic had been accu&s;tomed in the routine of his ordinary &s;ervice. They had entered into &s;ome conver&s;ation, for Mr. Falkland was not then in the habit of obliging the per&s;ons about him by formality and re&s;erve to re|collect who he was. The attractions of the &s;cene made them break off the talk &s;omewhat abruptly, that they might enjoy it without interruption. They had not rode far, before a hollow wind &s;eem|ed to ri&s;e at a di&s;tance, and they could hear the hoar&s;e roarings of the &s;ea. Pre&s;ently the &s;ky on one &s;ide a&s;&s;umed the appearance of a reddi&s;h brown, and a &s;udden angle in the road placed this phenomenon directly before them. As they proceeded it be|came more di&s;tinct, and it was at length &s;uffi|ciently vi&s;ible that it was occa&s;ioned by a fire. Mr. Falkland put &s;purs to his hor&s;e; and, as they ap|proached, the object pre&s;ented every in&s;tant a more tremendous appearance. The flames a&s;cended with fiercene&s;s; they embraced a large portion of the horizon; and, as they carried up along with them numerous little fragments of the materials that fed them, impregnated with fire, and of an extremely bright and luminous colour, they pre|&s;ented no inadequate image of the eruption of a volcano.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="028752_0077_0FDBF0002A609A30">
The flames proceeded from a village directly in their road. There were eight or ten hou&s;es already on fire, and the whole &s;eemed to be threatened with immediate de&s;truction. The inhabitants were in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation, having had no pre|vious experience of a &s;imilar calamity. They con|veyed with ha&s;te their moveables and furniture into the adjoining fields, the whole &s;urface of which was heated to an uncommon degree. When any of them had effected this as far as it could be at|tempted with &s;afety, they were unable to conceive any farther remedy, but &s;tood wringing their hands and contemplating the ravages of the fire in an agony of powerle&s;s de&s;pair. The water that could be procured in any mode practi&s;ed in that place, was but as a drop contending with a whole element in arms. The wind in the mean time was ri&s;ing, and the flames &s;pread with more and more ra|pidity.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland contemplated this &s;cene for a few minutes, as if ruminating with him&s;elf as to what could be done. He then directed &s;ome of the country people about him to pull down a hou&s;e, next to one that was wholly on fire, but which it|&s;elf was not yet touched. They &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed at a direction which implied a voluntary de&s;truc|tion of property, and con&s;idered the ta&s;k as too much in the heart of the danger to be undertaken. Ob&s;erving that they were motionle&s;s, he di&s;mount|ed from his hor&s;e, and called upon them in an au|thoritative voice to follow him. He a&s;cended the hou&s;e in an in&s;tant, and pre&s;ently appeared upon the top of it as if in the mid&s;t of the flames. Having, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two or three of the per&s;ons that followed him mo&s;t clo&s;ely, and who by this time had &s;upplied them&s;elves with whatever tools came next to hand, loo&s;ened the &s;upport of a &s;tack of chimnies, he pu&s;hed them headlong into
<PB N="76" REF="028752_0078_0FDBEFB8CC8830E0">
the mid&s;t of the fire. He pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed along the roof; and, having &s;et people to work on all parts, de&s;cended in order to &s;ee what could be done in any other quarter.</P>
<P>At this moment an elderly woman bur&s;t from the mid&s;t of a hou&s;e in flames. The utmo&s;t con|&s;ternation was painted in her looks; and, as &s;oon as &s;he could recollect her&s;elf enough to have a pro|per idea of her &s;ituation, the &s;ubject of her anxiety &s;eemed in an in&s;tant to be totally changed. Where is my child? cried &s;he, and ca&s;t an anxious and piercing look among the &s;urrounding crowd. Oh, &s;he is lo&s;t! &s;he is in the mid&s;t of the flames! Save her! &s;ave her! my child! She filled the air with heart-rending &s;hrieks. She turned towards the hou&s;e. The people that were near endeavoured to prevent her, but &s;he &s;hook them off in a moment. She entered the pa&s;&s;age; viewed the hideous ruin; and was then going to plunge into the blazing &s;tair|ca&s;e. Mr. Falkland &s;eized her arm; it was Mrs. Jakeman. Stop! he cried, with a voice that &s;eem|ed more than human. Stay you here! I will &s;eek, I will &s;ave her! He charged the attendants to detain Mrs. Jakeman; he enquired which was the apartment of Emily. Mrs. Jakeman was upon a vi&s;it to a &s;i&s;ter who lived in the village, and had brought Emily along with her. Mr. Falkland a&s;|cended a neighbouring hou&s;e; entered that in which Emily was, by a window in the roof; and in two minutes re-appeared with his lovely burthen in his arms. Having re&s;tored her to her affec|tionate protector &s;natched from the immediate gra&s;p of death, from which, if he had not, none would have delivered her, he returned to his for|mer ta&s;k. By his pre&s;ence of mind, by his inde|fatigable humanity and ince&s;&s;ant exertions, he &s;aved three-fourths of the village from de&s;truction. The conflagration being at length abated, he &s;ought
<PB N="77" REF="028752_0079_0FDBF00253ACC228">
again Mrs. Jakeman and Emily. He di&s;played the tendere&s;t &s;olicitude for the young lady's &s;afety, and directed Collins to go with as much &s;peed as he could, and &s;end his chariot to attend her. More than an hour elap&s;ed in this interval. Mi&s;s Mel|vile had never &s;een &s;o much of Mr. Falkland upon any former occa&s;ion, and the &s;pectacle of &s;uch hu|manity, delicacy, firmne&s;s and ju&s;tice in the form of man, as he crowded into this &s;mall &s;pace, was both altogether new to her, and in the highe&s;t de|gree fa&s;cinating.</P>
<P>Emily no &s;ooner arrived at the family man&s;ion, than Mr. Tyrrel ran out to receive her. He had ju&s;t heard of the melancholy accident that had taken place at the village, and was terrified for the &s;afety of his good-humoured cou&s;in. He di&s;play|ed tho&s;e unpremeditated emotions which are com|mon to almo&s;t every individual of the human race. He was greatly &s;hocked at the &s;u&s;picion that Emily might po&s;&s;ibly have become the victim of a cata&s;|trophe which had thus broken out in the very dead of night. His &s;en&s;ations were of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;ort, when he folded her in his arms, and fearful apprehen&s;ion was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly converted into joyous certainty. Emily no &s;ooner entered the well-known roof, than &s;he forgot all &s;he had &s;uffer|ed; her &s;pirits were bri&s;k, and her tongue ince&s;|&s;ant in de&s;cribing her danger and her deliverance. Mr. Tyrrel had formerly been tortured with the innocent eulogiums &s;he pronounced of Mr. Falk|land. But the&s;e were tamene&s;s it&s;elf, compared with the rich and various eloquence that now flowed from her lips. She de&s;cribed his activity and his re&s;ources, the promptitude with which every thing was conceived, and the cautious, but daring wi&s;dom with which it was executed. All was fairy-land and enchantment in the tenour of her artle&s;s tale; you &s;aw a beneficent genius &s;ur|veying
<PB N="78" REF="028752_0080_0FDBEFBA529CA600">
and controuling the whole, but could have no notion of any human means by which his pur|po&s;es were effected.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel li&s;tened for a while to the&s;e innocent effu&s;ions with patience; he could even bear to hear the man applauded by whom he had ju&s;t obtained &s;o con&s;iderable a benefit. But the theme by am|plification became nau&s;eous, and he was at length obliged with &s;ome roughne&s;s to put an end to the tale. Probably upon recollection it appeared &s;till more in&s;olent and intolerable than while it was pa&s;&s;ing; the &s;en&s;ation of gratitude wore off, but the hyperbolical prai&s;e that had been be&s;towed &s;till haunted his memory, and &s;ounded in his ear: Emily &s;eemed to have entered into the confederacy that di&s;turbed his repo&s;e. As for the young lady her&s;elf, &s;he was wholly uncon&s;cious of the offence that had been given, and upon every occa&s;ion quoted Mr. Falkland as the model of elegant man|ners and true wi&s;dom. She was a total &s;tranger to di&s;&s;imulation; and &s;he could not conceive that any body beheld the object of her admiration with le&s;s partiality than her inexperienced heart had enter|tained. Meanwhile her artle&s;s love became more fervent than ever. She flattered her&s;elf that no|thing le&s;s than a reciprocal pa&s;&s;ion could have prompted Mr. Falkland to the de&s;perate attempt of &s;aving her from the flames; and &s;he tru&s;ted that this pa&s;&s;ion would &s;peedily bur&s;t the barriers of &s;ilence, as well as induce the object of her affec|tion to overlook her comparative unworthine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel endeavoured at fir&s;t to check Mi&s;s Melvile in her applau&s;es, and to convince her by various tokens that the &s;ubject was di&s;agreeable to him. Emily was accu&s;tomed to yield implicit and unreluctant obedience, and therefore it was not difficult to re&s;train her; but upon the very next occa&s;ion her favourite topic would force its way to
<PB N="79" REF="028752_0081_0FDBF007D35A1DE8">
her lips. Her obedience was the acquie&s;cence of a frank and benevolent heart; but it was the mo&s;t difficult thing in the world to in&s;pire her with fear. Con&s;cious her&s;elf that &s;he would not hurt a worm, &s;he could not conceive that any one would harbour cruelty and rancour again&s;t her. Her temper pre|&s;erved her from ob&s;tinate contention with the per|&s;ons under who&s;e protection &s;he was placed; and, as her compliance was unhe&s;itating, &s;he had had no experience of a &s;evere and rigorous treatment. As Mr. Tyrrel's objection to the very name of Falkland became more palpable and uniform, Mi&s;s Melvile increa&s;ed in her precaution. She would &s;top her&s;elf in the half-pronounced &s;entences that were meant to his prai&s;e. This circum&s;tance had nece&s;&s;arily an ungracious effect; it was a cutting &s;atire upon the imbecility of her kin&s;man. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions &s;he would &s;ometimes venture upon a good-humoured expo&s;tulation: Dear &s;ir! well, I wonder how you can be &s;o ill-natured! I am &s;ure Mr. Falkland would do you any good office in the world: till &s;he was checked by &s;ome ge&s;ture of im|patience and fiercene&s;s.</P>
<P>At length &s;he wholly conquered her heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s and inattention. But it was now too late. Mr. Tyrrel already &s;u&s;pected the exi&s;tence of that pa&s;|&s;ion which &s;he had thoughtle&s;sly imbibed. His imagination, ingenious in torment, &s;ugge&s;ted to him all the different openings in conver&s;ation in which &s;he would have introduced the prai&s;e of Mr. Falkland, had &s;he not been placed under this un|natural re&s;traint. Her pre&s;ent re&s;erve upon the &s;ubject was more in&s;ufferable than even her former loquacity. All his kindne&s;s for this unhappy or|phan gradually &s;ub&s;ided. Her partiality for the man who of all others was mo&s;t the object of his hatred, appeared to him as the la&s;t per&s;ecution of a malicious de&s;tiny. He figured him&s;elf as about
<PB N="80" REF="028752_0082_0FDBEFBE8255F238">
to be de&s;erted by every creature in human form, all men under the influence of a fatal enchantment approving only what was &s;ophi&s;ticated and arti|ficial, and holding the rude and genuine offspring of nature in mortal antipathy. Impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e gloomy pre&s;ages, he &s;aw mi&s;s Melvile with no &s;entiments but tho&s;e of rancorous abhorrence; and, accu&s;tomed as he was to the uncontrouled in|dulgence of all his propen&s;ities, determined to wreak upon her a &s;ignal revenge.</P>

<P>MR. TYRREL con&s;ulted his old confident re|&s;pecting the plan he &s;hould pur&s;ue, who on his part felt no compunction upon the &s;ubject, nor had any idea that an in&s;ignificant girl, without either wealth or beauty, ought to be allowed for a moment to &s;tand in the way of the gratifications of a man of Mr. Tyrrel's importance. The fir&s;t idea of her now-unrelenting kin&s;man was to thru&s;t her from his doors, and leave her to &s;eek her bread in the wide world. But he was con&s;cious that this proceeding would involve him in con&s;iderable obloquy; and he at length fixed upon a &s;cheme which, at the &s;ame time that he believed it would &s;ufficiently &s;helter his reputation, would much more certainly &s;ecure her mortification and puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e he fixed upon a young man of twenty, the &s;on of one Grimes, who occupied a &s;mall farm the property of his confident. This fellow he re&s;olved to impo&s;e as a hu&s;band on Mi&s;s Melvile, who he &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected, guided by the tender &s;entiments &s;he had unfortunately con|ceived for Mr. Falkland, would li&s;ten with reluc|tance to any matrimonial propo&s;al. Grimes he &s;e|lected as being in all re&s;pects the diametrical rever&s;e of Mr. Falkland. He was not preci&s;ely a lad of vicious propen&s;ities, but in an inconceivable degree boori&s;h and uncouth. His complexion was &s;carcely human; his features were coar&s;e, and &s;trangely di&s;cordant and disjointed from each other. His lips were thick, and the tone of his voice broad
<PB N="82" REF="028752_0084_0FDBEFBF99641770">
and unmodulated. His legs were of equal &s;ize from one end to the other, and his feet mi&s;hapen and clum&s;y. He had nothing &s;piteful or malicious in his di&s;po&s;ition, but he was a total &s;tranger to tenderne&s;s; he could not feel for tho&s;e refinements in others, of which he had no experience in him|&s;elf. He was an expert boxer; his inclination led him to &s;uch amu&s;ements as were mo&s;t boi&s;terous; and he delighted in a &s;ort of manual &s;arca&s;m, which he could not conceive to be very injurious, as it left no traces behind it. His general manners were noi&s;y and ob&s;treperous; inattentive to others; and ob&s;tinate and unyielding, not from any cruelty and ruggedne&s;s of temper, but from an incapacity to conceive tho&s;e finer feelings that make &s;o large a part of the hi&s;tory of per&s;ons who are ca&s;t in a gentler mould.</P>
<P>Such was the uncouth and half-civili&s;ed animal which the indu&s;trious malice of Mr. Tyrrel fixed upon as mo&s;t happily adapted to his purpo&s;e. Emily had hitherto been in an unu&s;ual degree ex|empted from the oppre&s;&s;ion of de&s;poti&s;m. Her happy in&s;ignificance had &s;erved her as a protection. No one thought it worth his while to fetter her with tho&s;e numerous petty re&s;trictions, with which the daughters of opulence are commonly tormented. She had the wildne&s;s as well as the delicate frame of the bird that warbles unmole&s;ted in its native groves.</P>
<P>When therefore &s;he heard from her kin&s;man the propo&s;al of Mr. Grimes for a hu&s;band, &s;he was for a moment &s;ilent with a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;o unex|pected a &s;ugge&s;tion. But, as &s;oon as &s;he recovered her &s;peech, &s;he replied: No, &s;ir, I thank you. Ble&s;s me! I do not want a hu&s;band: I am but a child.</P>
<P>You are a woman! Are not you always han|kering after the men? It is high time you &s;hould be &s;ettled.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="028752_0085_0FDBF00E75AC3430">
Mr. Grimes is &s;uch a &s;trange man. Why, I do not know what he is like! He is like for all the world a great huge porpu&s;s. No, I thank you! when I do have a hu&s;band, it &s;hall not be &s;uch a man as Grimes neither.</P>
<P>Be &s;ilent! How dare you give your tongue &s;uch unaccountable liberties?</P>
<P>Well, I wonder what I &s;hould do with him. Why, it is like as if you &s;hould give me your great rough water-dog, and bid me make him a &s;ilk cu&s;hion to lie on in my dre&s;&s;ing-room. Be&s;ide, &s;ir, Grimes is a common labouring man, and I am &s;ure I have always heard my aunt &s;ay that ours is a very great family.</P>
<P>It is a lie. Our family! Have you the impu|dence to think your&s;elf one of our family?</P>
<P>Lord, &s;ir! was not your grandpapa my grand|papa? And how then can we be of a different family?</P>
<P>For a damned &s;trong rea&s;on. You are the daughter of a ra&s;cally Scotchman, who &s;pent every &s;hilling of my aunt Hannah's fortune, and left you a beggar. You have got a hundred pounds, and Grimes's father promi&s;es to give him as much. How dare you look down upon your equals?</P>
<P>Nay, now, &s;ir, I am &s;ure I am not proud. But indeed and indeed, &s;ir, I can never love Mr. Grimes. Dear, dear! he is more like a cart-hor&s;e than a hu&s;band. I am very happy as I am. I love you, and I love Mrs. Jakeman: why &s;hould I be married?</P>
<P>Cea&s;e your prating! Grimes will be here this afternoon. Look that you behave well to him. If you do not, he will remember and repay when you lea&s;t like it.</P>
<P>Now, I am &s;ure, &s;ir, you&mdash;you are not in ear|ne&s;t?</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="028752_0086_0FDBEFC170723CA8">
Not in earne&s;t! Damn me but we will &s;ee that. I can tell what you would be at. You had rather be Mr. Falkland's mi&s;s, than the wife of a plain downright yeoman. But I &s;hall take care of you.&mdash;Aye, this comes of indulgence. You mu&s;t be taken down, mi&s;s. You mu&s;t be taught the dif|ference between high-flown notions and realities. Mayhap you may take it a little in dudgeon or &s;o. But never mind that. Pride always wants a little &s;marting. If you &s;hould be brought to &s;hame, it is I that &s;hall bear all the blame of it.</P>
<P>The tone in which Mr. Tyrrel &s;poke was &s;o different from any thing to which Mi&s;s Melvile had been accu&s;tomed, that &s;he felt her&s;elf wholly un|able to determine what con&s;truction to put upon it. Sometimes &s;he thought he had really formed a plan for impo&s;ing upon her a condition, that &s;he could not bear &s;o much as to think of. But pre|&s;ently &s;he rejected this idea as an unworthy impu|tation upon her kin&s;man, and concluded that it was only his way, and that all he meant was to try her. To be re&s;olved however &s;he determined to con&s;ult her con&s;tant advi&s;er, Mrs. Jakeman, and accordingly repeated to her what had pa&s;&s;ed. Mrs. Jakeman &s;aw the whole in a very different light from that in which Emily had conceived it, and trembled for the future peace of her beloved ward.</P>
<P>Lord ble&s;s me, my dear mamma! cried Emily, (this was the appellation &s;he delighted to be&s;tow upon the good hou&s;e-keeper) &s;ure you cannot think &s;o. But I do not care. I will never marry Grimes let them do as they will.</P>
<P>But how will you help your&s;elf? My ma&s;ter will oblige you.</P>
<P>Nay, now you think you are talking to a child indeed. It is I am to have the man, not Mr. Tyrrel. Do you think I will let any body el&s;e
<PB N="85" REF="028752_0087_0FDBF00FD4D0FEA8">
choo&s;e a hu&s;band for me? I am not &s;uch a fool as that neither.</P>
<P>Ah, Emily! you little know the di&s;advantages of your &s;ituation. Your cou&s;in is a violent man, and perhaps will turn you out of doors, if you oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>Oh, mamma, it is very wicked of you to &s;ay &s;o. I am &s;ure Mr. Tyrrel is a very good man, though he be a little cro&s;s now and then. He knows very well that I am right to have a will of my own in &s;uch a thing as this, and nobody is puni&s;hed for doing what is right.</P>
<P>Nobody ought, my dear child. But there are very wicked and tyrannical men in the world.</P>
<P>Well, well, I will never believe that my cou&s;in is one of tho&s;e.</P>
<P>I hope he is not.</P>
<P>And, if he were, what then? To be &s;ure I &s;hould be very &s;orry to make him angry.</P>
<P>What then? Why then my poor, dear Emily would be a beggar. Do you think I could bear to &s;ee that?</P>
<P>No, no. Mr. Tyrrel has ju&s;t told me that I have a hundred pounds. But, if I had no fortune at all, is not that the ca&s;e with a thou&s;and other folks? Why &s;hould I grieve, for what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear and are merry? Do not make your&s;elf unea&s;y, mamma. I am determined that I will do any thing rather than marry Grimes however; that is what I will.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jakeman could not bear the unea&s;y &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e in which this conver&s;ation left her mind, and went immediately to the &s;quire to have her doubts re&s;olved. The manner in which &s;he pro|po&s;ed the que&s;tion &s;ufficiently indicated the judg|ment &s;he had formed of the match in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>That is true, &s;aid Mr. Tyrrel, I wanted to &s;peak to you about this affair. The girl has got unac|countable
<PB N="86" REF="028752_0088_0FDBEFC2AC875678">
notions in her head, that will be the ruin of her. You perhaps can tell where &s;he had them. But, be that as it may, it is high time &s;omething &s;hould be done. The &s;horte&s;t way is the be&s;t, and to keep things well while they are well. In &s;hort, I am determined &s;he &s;hall marry this lad: you do not know any harm of him, do you? You have a good deal of influence with her, and I de|&s;ire, do you &s;ee! that you will employ it to lead her to her good: you had be&s;t, I can tell you. She is a pert vixen! By and by &s;he would be a whore, and at la&s;t no better than a common trull, and rot upon a dunghill, if I were not at all the&s;e pains to &s;ave her from de&s;truction. I would make her an hone&s;t farmer's wife, and my pretty mi&s;s cannot bear the thoughts of it!</P>
<P>In the afternoon Grimes came according to ap|pointment, and was left alone with the young lady. Well, mi&s;s, &s;aid he, it &s;eems the &s;quire has a mind to make us man and wife. For my part, I cannot &s;ay I &s;hould have thought of it. But, being as how the &s;quire has broke the ice, if &s;o be as you like of the match, why I am your man. Say the word; a nod is as good as a wink to a blind hor&s;e; and then, do you &s;ee, why there is no more to be &s;aid.</P>
<P>Emily was already &s;ufficiently mortified at the unexpected propo&s;al of Mr. Tyrrel. She was con|founded at the novelty of the &s;ituation, and &s;till more at the uncultivated rudene&s;s of her lover, which even exceeded her expectation. This con|fu&s;ion was interpreted by Grimes into diffidence.</P>
<P>Come, come, never be ca&s;t down. Put a good face upon it. What though? My fir&s;t &s;weetheart was Bet Butterfield, but what of that? What mu&s;t be mu&s;t be; grief will never fill the belly. She was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine &s;trapping wench, that is the truth of it! Five foot ten inches, and as &s;tout as a
<PB N="87" REF="028752_0089_0FDBF01213ABD3E0">
trooper. Oh, &s;he would do a power of work! Up early and down late; milked ten cows with her own hands; on with her cardinal, rode to market between her panniers, fair weather and foul, hail, blow or &s;now. It would have done your heart good to have &s;een her fro&s;t-bitten cheeks, as red as a beefen from her own orchard! Ah, &s;he was a maid of mettle; would romp with the harve&s;t men, &s;lap one upon the back, wre&s;tle with another, and had a rogue's trick and a joke for all round. Poor girl! &s;he broke her neck down &s;tairs at a chri&s;tening. To be &s;ure I &s;hall never meet with her fellow! But never you mind that! I do not doubt that I &s;hall find more in you upon farther acquaintance. As coy and ba&s;hful as you &s;eem, I dare &s;ay you are rogue enough at bottom. When I have touzled and rumpled you a little, we &s;hall &s;ee. I am no chicken, mi&s;s, whatever you may think me. I know what is what, and can &s;ee as far into a mil&s;tone as another. Ay&punc; ay; you will come to. The fi&s;h will &s;nap at the bait, never doubt it. Yes, yes, we &s;hall rub on main well together.</P>
<P>Emily by this time had in &s;ome degree mu&s;tered up her &s;pirits, and began, though with he&s;itation, to thank Mr. Grimes for his good opinion, but to confe&s;s that &s;he could never be brought to favour his addre&s;&s;es. She therefore intreated him to de|&s;i&s;t from all farther application. This remon&s;trance on her part would have become more intelligible, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not been for his boi&s;terous manners and ex|travagant chearfulne&s;s, which indi&s;po&s;ed him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> made him &s;uppo&s;e that at half a word he had a &s;ufficient intimation of another's meaning. Mr. Tyrrel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the mean time took care to interrupt the &s;cene before they could have time to proceed far in explanation, and was &s;tudious in the &s;equel to prevent the young folks from being too intimately
<PB N="88" REF="028752_0090_0FDBEFC603302980">
acquainted with each other's inclinations. Grimes of con&s;equence attributed all the reluctance of mi&s;s Melvile to maiden coyne&s;s, and the &s;kitti&s;h &s;hyne&s;s of an unbroken colt. Indeed had it been other|wi&s;e, it is not probable that it would have made any effectual impre&s;&s;ion upon him; as he was always accu&s;tomed to talk of women as made for the recreation of the men, and to exclaim again&s;t the ill-judged weakne&s;s of people who taught them to imagine that they were entitled to judge for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>As the &s;uit proceeded and mi&s;s Melvile &s;aw more of her new admirer, her antipathy increa&s;ed. But, though her character was un&s;poiled by tho&s;e fal&s;e wants which frequently make people of family mi&s;erable while they have every thing that nature requires within their reach, yet &s;he had been little u&s;ed to oppo&s;ition, and was really terrified by the growing &s;ternne&s;s of her kin&s;man. Sometimes &s;he thought of flying from a hou&s;e which was now become her dungeon; but the habits of her youth, and her ignorance of the world made her &s;hrink from this project when &s;he contemplated it more nearly. Mrs. Jakeman indeed could not think with patience of young Grimes as a hu&s;band for her darling Emily, but her prudence determined her to re&s;i&s;t with all her might the idea on the part of the young lady of proceeding to extremi|ties. She could not believe that Mr. Tyrrel would per&s;i&s;t in &s;uch an unaccountable per&s;ecution, and &s;he exhorted mi&s;s Melvile to forget for a moment the unaffected independence of her character, and pathetically to deprecate Mr. Tyrrel's ob&s;tinacy. She had great confidence in the ingenuous elo|quence of her ward. Mrs. Jakeman did not know what was pa&s;&s;ing in the mind of the tyrant.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Melvile complied with the &s;ugge&s;tion of her mamma. One morning immediately after break|fa&s;t
<PB N="89" REF="028752_0091_0FDBF017DB87C678">
&s;he went to the harp&s;ichord, and played one after another &s;everal of tho&s;e airs that were mo&s;t the fav&ograve;urites of Mr. Tyrrel. Mrs. Jakeman was retired; the &s;ervants were gone to their re&s;pective employments. Mr. Tyrrel would have gone al&s;o; his mind was untuned, and he did not take the plea&s;ure he had been accu&s;tomed to take in the mu&s;ical performances of Emily. But her finger was now more ta&s;teful than common. Her mind was probably wrought up to a firmer and bolder tone by the recollection of the cau&s;e &s;he was going to plead, at the &s;ame time that it was exempt from tho&s;e incapacitating tremors which would have been felt by one that dared not look poverty in the face. Mr. Tyrrel was unable to leave the apart|ment. Sometimes he traver&s;ed it with impatient &s;tep; then he hung over the poor innocent who&s;e powers were exerted to plea&s;e him; at length he threw him&s;elf in a chair oppo&s;ite, with his eyes turned towards Emily. It was ea&s;y to trace the progre&s;s of his emotions. The furrows into which his countenance was contracted were gradually re|laxed; his features were brightened into a &s;mile; the kindne&s;s with which he had upon former occa|&s;ions contemplated Emily &s;eemed to revive in his heart.</P>
<P>Emily watched her opportunity. As &s;oon as &s;he had fini&s;hed one of the pieces, &s;he ro&s;e and went to Mr. Tyrrel.</P>
<P>Now have I not done it nicely? And after all this will not you give me a reward?</P>
<P>A reward! Ay, come here, and I will give you a ki&s;s.</P>
<P>Pooh! no, that is not it. And yet you have not ki&s;&s;ed me this many a day. Formerly you &s;aid you loved me, and called me your Emily. I am &s;ure you did not love me better than I loved you. You would not make me mi&s;erable, would you?</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="028752_0092_0FDBEFC8DC5985C8">
Mi&s;erable! how can you a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;tion? But have a care! Do not put me out of humour. Do not come with any of your romantic notions now.</P>
<P>No, no. I had no romantic notions in my head. I want to &s;peak to you about &s;omething upon which the happine&s;s of my life depends.</P>
<P>I know what you would be at. Be &s;ilent. You know it is to no purpo&s;e to plague me with your &s;tubbornne&s;s. You will not let me be in good hu|mour with you for a moment. What my mind is determined on about Grimes, all the world &s;hall not move me to give up.</P>
<P>Dear, dear cou&s;in, why do but con&s;ider now. Grimes is a rough ru&s;tic lout, like Or&s;on in the &s;tory-book. He wants a wife like him&s;elf. He would be as unea&s;y and as much at a lo&s;s with me, as I with him. Why &s;hould we both of us be forced to do what neither of us is inclined to? I cannot think what could ever have put it in your head. But now, for goodne&s;s' &s;ake, give it up. Marriage is a &s;erious thing. You &s;hould not think of join|ing two people for a whim, who are neither of them fit for one another in any re&s;pect in the world. We &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eel mortified and di&s;appoint|ed all our lives. Month would go after month, and year after year, and I could never hope to be my own but by the death of a per&s;on I ought to love. I am &s;ure, &s;ir, you cannot mean me all this harm. What have I done, that I &s;hould de&s;erve to have you for this enemy?</P>
<P>I am not your enemy. I tell you that it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to put you out of harm's way. But, if I were your enemy, I could not be a wor&s;e torment to you than you are to me. Are not you conti|nually &s;inging the prai&s;es of Falkland? Are not you in love with Falkland? That man is a legion of devils to me! Plau&s;ible and empty him&s;elf, he

cheats every body, he cro&s;&s;es me in all my wi&s;hes; he runs away with the applau&s;e of the men, and the admiration of your fooli&s;h &s;ex. An un&s;poiled, genuine country-gentleman has no chance with him. I might as well have been a beggar! I might as well have been a dwarf or a mon&s;ter! Time was when I was thought entitled to re&s;pect. But now, debauched by this Frenchified ra&s;cal, they call me rude, &s;urly, brutal, a tyrant! It is true that I can|not talk in the&s;e finical phra&s;es, flatter people with hypocritical prai&s;e, or &s;uppre&s;s the real feelings of my mind!

<P>The angry expo&s;tulations of Mr. Tyrrel &s;ugge&s;t|ed new ideas to the tender mind of mi&s;s Melvile. He had never confe&s;&s;ed the emotions of his &s;oul &s;o explicitly before; but the growing tempe&s;t of his thoughts &s;uffered him to be no longer ma&s;ter of him&s;elf. She &s;aw with a&s;toni&s;hment that he was
<PB N="92" REF="028752_0094_0FDBEFCC5FDC3830">
the irreconcilable foe of Mr. Falkland, whom &s;he fondly imagined it was the &s;ame thing to know and admire; and that he harboured a deep and rooted re&s;entment again&s;t her&s;elf. She recoiled without well knowing why before the ferocious pa&s;&s;ions of her kin&s;man, and was convinced that &s;he had no|thing to hope from his implacable temper. But her alarm was the prelude of firmne&s;s and not of cowardice.</P>
<P>No, &s;ir, replied &s;he, indeed I will not be driven any way that you happen to like. I have been u&s;ed to obey you, and in any thing that is rea&s;on|able I will obey you &s;till. But you urge me a little too far. Why do you tell me of Mr. Falkland? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I ever done any thing to de&s;erve your unkind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;picions? I am innocent, and will continue in|nocent. Mr. Grimes is well enough, and will no doubt find women that like him. But he is not &s;it for me, and torture &s;hall not force me to be his wife.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrrel was not a little a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;pirit which Emily di&s;played upon this occa&s;ion. He had calculated too &s;ecurely upon the general mildne&s;s and &s;uavity of her di&s;po&s;ition. He now endeavoured to qualify the har&s;hne&s;s of his former &s;entiments.</P>
<P>G&mdash;damn my &s;oul! And &s;o you can &s;cold can you? You expect every body to turn out of his way, and fetch and carry, ju&s;t as you plea&s;e? I could find in my heart to break your heart. But you know my mind. I in&s;i&s;t upon it that you let Grimes court you, and that you lay a&s;ide your &s;ulks, and give him a fair hearing. Will you do that? If then you per&s;i&s;t in your wilfulne&s;s, why there, I &s;uppo&s;e, is an end of the matter. Do not think that any body is going to marry you, whether you will or no. You are no &s;uch mighty prize, I a&s;|&s;ure you. If you knew your own intere&s;t, you
<PB N="93" REF="028752_0095_0FDBF020B871F768">
would be glad to take the young fellow, while he is willing.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Melvile rejoiced in the pro&s;pect which the la&s;t words of her kin&s;man afforded her, of a ter|mination at no great di&s;tance to her pre&s;ent per&s;e|cutions. Mrs. Jakeman, to whom &s;he communi|cated them, congratulated Emily on the returning moderation and good &s;en&s;e of the &s;quire, and her|&s;elf on her prudence in having urged the young lady to this happy expo&s;tulation. But their mu|tual felicitations la&s;ted not long. Mr. Tyrrel in|formed Mrs. Jakeman of the nece&s;&s;ity in which he found him&s;elf of &s;ending her to a di&s;tance upon a bu&s;ine&s;s which would not fail to detain her &s;eve|ral weeks; and, though the errand by no means wore an artificial or ambiguous face, the two friends drew a melancholy pre&s;age from this ill-timed &s;e|paration. Mrs. Jakeman in the mean time exhort|ed her ward to per&s;evere, reminded her of the com|punction which had already been manife&s;ted by her kin&s;man, and encouraged her to hope every thing from her courage and good temper. Emily on her part, though grieved at the ab&s;ence of her protector and coun&s;ellor at &s;o intere&s;ting a cri&s;is, was unable to &s;u&s;pect Mr. Tyrrel of &s;uch a degree either of malice or duplicity as could afford ground for &s;erious alarm. She congratulated her&s;elf upon her delivery from &s;o alarming a per&s;ecution, and drew a progno&s;tic of future &s;ucce&s;s from this happy termination of the fir&s;t &s;erious affair of her life. She exchanged a &s;tate of fortitude and alarm for her former plea&s;ing dreams re&s;pecting Mr. Falk|land. The&s;e &s;he bore without impatience. She was even taught by the uncertainty of the event to de&s;ire to prolong rather than abridge a &s;ituation, which might be delu&s;ive, but was not without its plea&s;ures.</P>

<P>NOTHING could be farther from Mr. Tyrrel's intention than to &s;uffer his project to be thus ter|minated. No &s;ooner was he wholly freed from the fear of his hou&s;ekeeper's interference, than he changed the whole &s;y&s;tem of his conduct. He ordered Mi&s;s Melvile to be clo&s;ely confined to her own apartment, and deprived of all the means of communicating her &s;ituation to any one out of his own hou&s;e. He placed over her a female &s;ervant in who&s;e di&s;cretion he could confide, and who, having formerly been honoured with &s;ome amorous notices from the &s;quire, con&s;idered the di&s;tinctions that were paid to Emily at Tyrrel Place as an u&s;ur|pation upon her more rea&s;onable claims. The &s;quire him&s;elf did every thing in his power to bla&s;t the young lady's reputation, and repre&s;ented to his attendants all the&s;e precautions as nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent her from eloping to his neighbour, and plunging her&s;elf in total ruin.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Mi&s;s Melvile had been twenty-four hours in durance, and there was &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that her &s;pirit might be &s;ubdued to the emergency of her &s;ituation, Mr. Tyrrel thought proper to go to her, to explain the grounds of her pre&s;ent treatment, and acquaint her with the only means by which &s;he could hope for any change. Emily no &s;ooner &s;aw him, than &s;he turned towards him with an air of greater firmne&s;s than perhaps &s;he had ever a&s;&s;umed in her life, and acco&s;ted him thus:</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="028752_0097_0FDBF021D3C43228">
Well, &s;ir, is it you? I wanted to &s;ee you. It &s;eems I am &s;hut up here by your orders? What does this mean? What right have you to make a pri&s;oner of me? What do I owe you? Your mo|ther left me a hundred pounds: have you ever offered to make any addition to my fortune? But, if you had, I do not want it I do not pretend to be better than the children of other poor parents; I can maintain my&s;elf as they do I prefer liberty to wealth. I &s;ee you are &s;urpri&s;ed at the re&s;olu|tion I exert. But ought I not to turn again, when I am trampled upon? I &s;hould have left you be|fore now, if Mrs. Jakeman had not overper&s;uaded me, and if I had not thought better of you than by your pre&s;ent behaviour I find you de&s;erve. But now, &s;ir, I intend to leave your hou&s;e this moment, and I in&s;i&s;t upon it that you do not endeavour to prevent me.</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, &s;he aro&s;e, and went towards the door, while Mr. Tyrrel &s;tood thunder&s;truck at her magnanimity. Seeing however that &s;he was upon the point of being out of the reach of his power, he recovered him&s;elf, and pulled her back.</P>
<P>What is in the wind now? Do you think, you na&s;ty &s;trumpet, that you &s;hall get the better of me by &s;heer impudence? Sit down! re&s;t you &s;atis|fied!&mdash;So you want to know by what right you are here, do you? By the right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This hou&s;e is mine, and you are in my power. There is no Mrs. Jakeman now to &s;pirit you away; no, nor no Mr. Falkland to bully for you. Damn me, I have countermined you, and blown up all your &s;chemes. Do you think I want any other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, to puni&s;h an audacious rebel like you? Do you think I will be contradicted and oppo&s;ed for nothing? When did you ever know any body re&s;i&s;t my will without being made to repent? And &s;hall I now &s;ee my&s;elf brow-beaten by a chitty-faced girl? I
<PB N="96" REF="028752_0098_0FDBF05E94724C78">
am not come to that neither.&mdash;I have not given you a fortune? Damn you, who brought you up? I will make you a bill for clothing and lodging. Do not you know that every creditor has a right to &s;top his runaway debtor? You may think as you plea&s;e; but here you are till you marry Grimes. Heaven and earth &s;hall not prevent but I will get the better of your ob&s;tinacy yet.</P>
<P>Ungenerous, unmerciful man! and &s;o it is enough for you that I have nobody to defend me! But I am not &s;o helple&s;s as you may imagine. You may impri&s;on my body, but you cannot conquer my mind. Marry Mr. Grimes! And is this the way to bring me to your purpo&s;e? Every hard&s;hip I &s;uffer puts &s;till farther di&s;tant the end for which I am thus unju&s;tly treated. You are not u&s;ed to have your will contradicted! When did I ever con|tradict it? And in an affair that is &s;o completely my own concern &s;hall my will go for nothing? Are you not a&s;hamed of laying down this rule for your&s;elf, and &s;uffering no other creature to take the benefit of it? I want nothing of you; how dare you refu&s;e me the privilege of a rea&s;onable being, and deny me to live unmole&s;ted in poverty and innocence? What &s;ort of man do you &s;how your&s;elf in this ca&s;e, you who lay claim to the re|&s;pect and applau&s;e of every one that knows you?</P>
<P>The &s;pirited reproaches of Emily had at fir&s;t the effect to fill Mr. Tyrrel with a&s;toni&s;hment, and make him feel aba&s;hed and overawed in the pre|&s;ence of this unprotected innocent. But his con|fu&s;ion was the re&s;ult of &s;urpri&s;e. When the fir&s;t emotion wore off, his habitual pa&s;&s;ion returned. He cur&s;ed him&s;elf for an a&s;s in being moved be her expo&s;tulations, and was ten times more exa&s;|perated again&s;t Emily for daring to talk to him in this provoking language, at a time when &s;he had every thing to fear from his power. His de&s;potic
<PB N="97" REF="028752_0099_0FDBF027D8290730">
and unforgiving propen&s;ities were &s;timulated to a degree little &s;hort of madne&s;s. At the &s;ame time his manners, which were gloomy and thoughtful, led him to meditate a variety of &s;chemes for the puni&s;hment of her ob&s;tinacy. He began to &s;u&s;pect that there was little hope of &s;ucceeding by open force; he therefore determined to have recour&s;e to treachery.</P>
<P>He found in Grimes an in&s;trument &s;ufficiently adapted to his purpo&s;e. This fellow, who would not perhaps intentionally have hurt a worm, was fitted by the mere coar&s;ene&s;s of his perceptions for the perpetration of the greate&s;t injuries. He re|garded both injury and advantage merely as they related to the gratifications of appetite; and con|&s;idered it as an e&s;&s;ential part of true wi&s;dom to treat with contempt the effeminacy of tho&s;e who &s;uffer them&s;elves to be tormented with ideal mis|fortunes. He conceived that no happier de&s;tiny could befal a young woman than to be his wife, and believed that that termination would be an am|ple compen&s;ation for any calamines &s;he might &s;up|po&s;e her&s;elf to undergo in the interval. He was therefore ea&s;ily prevailed upon by certain tempta|tions which Mr. Tyrrel knew how to employ, to take a part in the plot into which Mi&s;s Melvile was meant to be betrayed.</P>
<P>Matters being thus prepared, Mr. Tyrrel pro|ceeded through the means of the jailor, (for the experience he had already had of per&s;onal di&s;cu&s;&s;ion did not incline him to repeat his vi&s;its) to play upon the fears of his pri&s;oner. This woman, &s;ometimes under pretence of friend&s;hip, and &s;ome|times with open malice, informed Emily from time to time of the preparations that were making for con&s;ummating her fate. One day the &s;quire had rode over to look at a neat little farm which was de&s;tined for the habitation of the new-married cou|ple,
<PB N="98" REF="028752_0100_0FDBD6D06D069898">
and at another a quantity of live &s;tock and hou&s;hold furniture was procured that every thing might be ready for their reception. She then told her of a licence that was bought, a par&s;on in rea|dine&s;s, and a day fixed for the nuptials. When Emily endeavoured, though with increa&s;ing mi&s;|givings, to ridicule the&s;e proceedings as ab&s;olutely nugatory without her con&s;ent, her artful gouver|nante told her various &s;tories of forced marriages, and a&s;&s;ured her that neither prote&s;tations, nor &s;ilence, nor fainting would be of any avail, either to &s;u&s;pend the ceremony, or to &s;et it a&s;ide when once performed.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of Mi&s;s Melvile was in an eminent degree pitiable. She had no intercour&s;e but with her per&s;ecutors. She had not a human being with whom to con&s;ult, and who might afford her the &s;malle&s;t degree of con&s;olation and encouragement. She had courage; but it was neither confirmed nor directed by the dictates of experience&punc; It could not therefore be expected to be &s;o inflexible as with better information it would no doubt have been found. She had a clear and noble &s;pirit; but &s;he had &s;ome of her &s;ex's errors. Her mind &s;unk un|der the uniform terrors with which &s;he was a&s;&s;ailed, and her health became vi&s;ibly impaired.</P>
<P>Her firmne&s;s being thus far undermined, Grimes, in pur&s;uance of his in&s;tructions, took care in his next interview to throw out an in&s;inuation, that for his own part he never cared much for the match, and, &s;ince &s;he was &s;o aver&s;e to it, would be very well contented that it &s;hould never take place. Emily was rejoiced to find her admirer in &s;o favour|able a di&s;po&s;ition; and earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed him to give effect to this humane declaration. Her repre|&s;entations to him on this &s;ubject were full of elo|quence and energy. Grimes appeared to be moved at the fervency of her manner; but objected the
<PB N="99" REF="028752_0101_0FDBF07104D33EA8">
re&s;entment of Mr. Tyrrel and his landlord, who would infallibly ruin him upon the lea&s;t appearance of backwardne&s;s on his part, as poor Hawkins had been ruined before. At length however he &s;ug|ge&s;ted a project in con&s;equence of which he might a&s;&s;i&s;t her in her e&s;cape, without its ever coming to their knowledge, as indeed there was no likelihood their &s;u&s;picions in this ca&s;e would fix upon him. To be &s;ure, &s;aid he, you have refu&s;ed me in a di&s;|dainful &s;ort of a way, as a man may &s;ay. Mayhap you thought I was no better than a brute. But I bear you no malice, and I will &s;how you that I am more kind-hearted than you have been willing to believe. It is a &s;trange &s;ort of a vagary you have taken, to &s;tand in your own light, and di&s;oblige all your friends. But, if you are re&s;olute to be off, do you &s;ee, I &s;corn to be the hu&s;band of a la&s;s that is not every bit as willing as I; and &s;o I will even help to put you in a condition to be free and follow your own inclinations.</P>
<P>Emily li&s;tened to the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions at fir&s;t with eagerne&s;s and approbation. But her fervency was &s;omewhat abated, when they came to di&s;cu&s;s the minute parts of the undertaking&punc; It was nece&s;&s;ary, as Grimes informed her, that her e&s;cape &s;hould be effected in the dead of the night. He would con|ceal him&s;elf for that purpo&s;e in the garden, and be provided with fal&s;e keys by which to deliver her from her pri&s;on The&s;e circum&s;tances were by no means adapted to calm her perturbed ima|gination. To throw her&s;elf into the arms of the man, who&s;e intercour&s;e &s;he was employing every method to avoid, and whom under the idea of a partner for life &s;he could lea&s;t of all men endure, was no doubt an extraordinary proceeding. The attendant circum&s;tances of darkne&s;s and &s;olitude aggravated the picture. The &s;ituation of Tyrrel Place was uncommonly lonely: it was three miles
<PB N="100" REF="028752_0102_0FDBF029593B59C0">
from the neare&s;t village, and no le&s;s than &s;even miles from that in which Mrs. Jakeman's &s;i&s;ter re|&s;ided, into who&s;e protection Mi&s;s Melvile was de|&s;irous of throwing her&s;elf. The ingenuous cha|racter of Emily did not allow her to &s;u&s;pect Grimes of intending to make an ungenerous and brutal ad|vantage of the&s;e circum&s;tances; but her mind in|voluntarily revolted again&s;t the idea of committing her&s;elf alone to the di&s;po&s;al of a man whom &s;he had lately been accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider as the in|&s;trument of her treacherous relation.</P>
<P>After having for &s;ome time revolved the&s;e con|&s;iderations, &s;he thought of the expedient of de&s;iring Grimes to engage Mrs. Jakeman's &s;i&s;ter to wait for her at the out&s;ide of the garden. But this Grimes peremptorily refu&s;ed. He even flew into a pa&s;&s;ion at the propo&s;al. It &s;howed very little gratitude, to de&s;ire him to di&s;clo&s;e to other people his concern in this dangerous affair. For his part he was de|termined in con&s;ideration of his own &s;afety never to appear in it to any living &s;oul. If Mi&s;s did not believe him, when he made this propo&s;al out of pure good nature, and would not tru&s;t him, a &s;ingle inch, &s;he might even &s;ee to the con&s;e|quences her&s;elf. He was re&s;olved to conde&s;cend no farther to the whims of a per&s;on who in her treatment of him had &s;hown her&s;elf as proud as Lucifer him&s;elf.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> her&s;elf to appea&s;e his re&s;entment; but all the eloquence of her new confederate could not prevail upon her in&s;tantly to give up her ob|jection. She de&s;ired till the next day to con&s;ider of it. The day after was fixed by Mr. Tyrrel for the marriage ceremony. In the mean time &s;he was pe&s;tered with intimations in a thou&s;and dif|ferent forms of the fate that &s;o nearly awaited her. The preparations were &s;o continued, methodical and regular, as to produce in her the mo&s;t painful
<PB N="101" REF="028752_0103_0FDBF0721303FF08">
and aching anxiety. If her heart attained a mo|ment's intermi&s;&s;ion upon the &s;ubject, her female attendant was &s;ure by &s;ome &s;ly hint or &s;arca&s;tical remark to put a &s;peedy termination to her tran|quillity. She felt her&s;elf, as &s;he afterwards re|marked, alone, unin&s;tructed, ju&s;t broken loo&s;e as it were from the trammels of infancy, without one &s;ingle creature to concern him&s;elf in her fate. She, who till then had never known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n enemy, had now for three weeks not &s;een the glimp&s;e of a human countenance that &s;he had not good rea&s;on to con&s;ider as wholly e&s;tranged to her. She now for the fir&s;t time experienced the angui&s;h of never having known her parents, and being ca&s;t entirely upon the charity of people with whom &s;he had too little equality to hope to receive from them the dues of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding night was filled with the mo&s;t anxious thoughts. When a momentary oblivion &s;tole upon her &s;en&s;es, her di&s;tempered imagination conjured up a thou&s;and images of violence and fal&s;hood, &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf in the hands of her de|termined enemies, who did not he&s;itate by the mo&s;t unintermitted treachery to complete her ruin. Her waking thoughts were not more con&s;oling. The &s;truggle was too great for her con&s;titution. As morning approached, &s;he re&s;olved at all hazards to put her&s;elf into the hands of Grimes. This de|termination was no &s;ooner made, than &s;he felt her heart &s;en&s;ibly lightened. She could not conceive of any purpo&s;es of inju&s;tice that might not be perpetrated by him with even more &s;ecurity at pre&s;ent than under any change of her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>When &s;he communicated her determination to Grimes, it was not po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay whether he re|ceived plea&s;ure or pain from the intimation. He &s;miled indeed, but his &s;mile was accompanied by a certain abrupt ruggedne&s;s of countenance, &s;o that

it might equally well be the &s;mile of &s;arca&s;m or of congratulation. He however renewed his a&s;&s;urance of fidelity to his engagements and punctuality of execution. Meanwhile the day was inter&s;per&s;ed with nuptial pre&s;ents and preparations, all indi|cating the firmne&s;s as well as &s;ecurity of the di|rectors of the &s;cene. Emily had hoped that, as the cri&s;is approached, they might have remitted &s;omething of their u&s;ual diligence. She was re&s;olved in that ca&s;e, if a fair opportunity had offered, to give the &s;lip both to her jailors, and to her new and half tru&s;ted confederate&punc; But, though extremely vigilant for that purpo&s;e, &s;he found the execution of this idea impracticable.</P>
<P>At length the night &s;o critical to her happine&s;s approached. The mind of Emily could not fail on this occa&s;ion to be extremely agitated. She had fir&s;t exerted all her per&s;picacity to elude the vigi|lance of her attendant. This in&s;olent and un|feeling tyrant, in&s;tead of any relentings, had only &s;ought to make &s;port of her anxiety. Accordingly in one in&s;tance &s;he hid her&s;elf, and, &s;uffering Emily to &s;uppo&s;e that the coa&s;t was clear, met her at the end of the gallery, near the top of the &s;tair|ca&s;e. How do you do, my dear? &s;aid &s;he, with an in&s;ulting tone. And &s;o the little dear thought it&s;elf cunning enough to outwit me, did it? Oh, it was a &s;ly little gip&s;ey! Go, go back, love; troop! Emily felt deeply the trick that was played upon her. She &s;ighed, but di&s;dained to return any an&s;wer to this low vulgarity. Being once more in her chamber, &s;he &s;at down in a chair, and re|mained buried in reverie for more than two hours. After this &s;he went to her drawers, and turned over in a hurrying, confu&s;ed way her linen and clothes, having in her mind the provi&s;ion it would be nece&s;&s;ary to make for her elopement. Her jailor officiou&s;ly followed her from place to place
<PB N="103" REF="028752_0105_0FDBF07395822250">
and ob&s;erved what &s;he did for the pre&s;ent in &s;ilence. It was now the hour of re&s;t. Good night, child, &s;aid this &s;aucy girl, in the act of retiring. It is time to lock up. For the few next hours the time is your own. Make the be&s;t u&s;e of it! Do'ee think you can creep out at the key hole, lovey? At eight o'clock you &s;ee me again. And then, and then, added &s;he, clapping her hands, it is all over. The &s;un is not &s;urer to ri&s;e, than you and your hone&s;t man to be made one.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething in the tone with which this &s;lut uttered her farewel, that for a moment &s;ugge&s;ted the que&s;tion to Emily, What does &s;he mean? Is it po&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould know what has been planned for the few next hours? If &s;he do, what will become of me then? But &s;urely her manner of &s;peaking was very unlike that of de|tection and reprimand!&mdash;With an aching heart &s;he folded up the few nece&s;&s;aries &s;he thought proper to take with her. She then li&s;tened with an anxiety that would almo&s;t have enabled her to hear the &s;tirring of a leaf. From time to time &s;he thought her ear was &s;truck with the &s;ound of feet; but the treading, if treading it were, was &s;o &s;oft, that &s;he could never a&s;certain whether it were a real &s;ound or the mere creature of the fancy. Then all was &s;till as if the univer&s;al motion had been at re&s;t. By and by &s;he conceived &s;he overheard a noi&s;e as of buzzing and low muttered &s;peech. Her heart palpitated; &s;he &s;aid, Am I betrayed? Am I the dupe of ba&s;e artifice and deceit? Pre&s;ently &s;he heard the &s;ound of a key in her chamber door, and Grimes made his appearance. She &s;tarted, and cried, Are we di&s;covered? did not I hear you &s;peak? Grimes advanced on tiptoe with his finger to his lip. No, no, replied be, all is &s;afe! He took her by the hand, led her in &s;ilence out of the hou&s;e and then acro&s;s the garden. Emily ex|amined

with her eye the doors and pa&s;&s;ages as they proceeded, looked on all &s;id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s with fearful &s;u&s;pi|cion, but every thing was as &s;he her&s;elf could have wi&s;hed. Grimes opened a back <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oor of the gar|den already unlocked, that led into an unfrequented lane. There &s;tood two hor&s;es ready equipped for the journey, their bridles hung to a po&s;t not &s;ix yards di&s;tant from the garden. Grimes pu&s;hed the door after them. By Gemini, &s;aid he, my heart was in my mouth&punc; As I comed along, I &s;aw Mun, coachey, pop along from the back door to the &s;tables. He was within a hop, &s;tep, and jump of me. But he had a lanthorn in his hand, and he did not &s;ee me, being as I was darkling.&mdash;Say|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted Mi&s;s Melvile to mount. He troubled her little during the route. On the con|trary, he was remarkably &s;ilent and contemplative, a circum&s;tance by no means di&s;agreeable to Emily, to whom his conver&s;ation had never been accept|able.</P>
<P>After having proceeded about two miles, they turned into a wood, through which the road lay that led to the place of their de&s;tination. The night was extremely dark, at the &s;ame time that the air was &s;oft and mild, it being now the middle of &s;ummer. Under pretence of exploring the way, Grimes contrived, when they had already penetrated into the mid&s;t of this gloomy &s;olitude, to get his hor&s;e abrea&s;t with that of Mi&s;s Melvile, and then &s;uddenly reaching out his hand, to &s;eize hold of her bridle. I think we may as well &s;top here a bit, &s;aid he.</P>
<P>Stop, exclaimed Emily with &s;urpri&s;e. Why &s;hould we &s;top? Mr. Grimes, what do you mean?</P>
<P>Come, come, &s;aid he, never trouble your&s;elf to wonder. Did you think I was &s;uch a goo&s;e, as to take all this trouble merely to gratify your whim? I' faith, nobody &s;hall find me a pack hor&s;e, to go
<PB N="105" REF="028752_0107_0FDBF074442E5BB8">
of other folks' errands, without knowing a rea&s;on why. I cannot &s;ay that I much minded to have you at fir&s;t; but your ways are enough to &s;tir the blood of my grandad. Far fetched and dear bought is always reli&s;hing. Your con&s;ent was &s;o hard to gain, that &s;quire thought it was &s;ure&s;t a&s;king in the dark. A' &s;aid however a' would have no &s;uch doings in his hou&s;e, and &s;o, do you &s;ee? we are comed here.</P>
<P>For God's &s;ake, Mr. Grimes, think what you are about! You cannot be ba&s;e enough to ruin a poor creature who has put her&s;elf under your pro|tection!</P>
<P>That is all bother. Ruin! no, no, I will make an hone&s;t woman of you, when all is done. Nay, none of your airs; no tricks upon travellers! I have you here as &s;afe as a hor&s;e in a pound; there is not a hou&s;e nor a &s;hed within a mile of us; and, if I mi&s;s the opportunity, you &s;hall call me &s;pade. Faith, you are a delicate mor&s;el, and there is no time to be lo&s;t!</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Melvile had but an in&s;tant in which to col|lect her thoughts. She felt that there was but little hope of &s;oftening the ob&s;tinate and in&s;en&s;ible brute in who&s;e power &s;he was placed. But the pre&s;ence of mind and intrepidity, &s;o peculiar to her character, did not now de&s;ert her. Grimes had &s;carcely fini&s;hed his harangue, when with a &s;trong and unexpected jerk &s;he di&s;engaged the bridle from his gra&s;p, and at the &s;ame time put her hor&s;e upon full &s;peed. She had &s;carcely advanced twice the length of her hor&s;e, when Grimes re|covered from his &s;urpri&s;e, and pur&s;ued her, inex|pre&s;&s;ibly mortified at being &s;o ea&s;ily overreached. The &s;ound of his hor&s;e behind &s;erved but to rou&s;e more completely the mettle of that of Emily; whether by accident or &s;agacity the animal pur&s;ued
<PB N="106" REF="028752_0108_0FDBF036D3149CF0">
without a fault the narrow and winding way; and the chace continued the whole length of the wood.</P>
<P>At the extremity of this wood there was a gate. The recollection of this &s;oftened a little the cutting di&s;appointment of Grimes, as he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure of putting an end by its a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the career of Emily, nor was it very probable that they &s;hould find any body to interrupt him there in the dead and &s;ilence of the night. By the mo&s;t extraordinary accident however they &s;ound a man on hor&s;eback in wait at this gate. Help, help! exclaimed the affrighted Emily! thieves! murder! help! The man was Mr. Falkland. Grimes knew his voice, and therefore, though he attempted a &s;ort of &s;ullen re&s;i&s;tance, it was feebly made. Two other men, whom by rea&s;on of the darkne&s;s he had not at fir&s;t &s;een, and who were Mr. Falkland's &s;ervants, hearing the bu&s;tle of the rencounter, and alarmed for the &s;afety of their ma&s;ter, rode up; and then Grimes, di&s;appointed at the lo&s;s of his gratification, and admoni&s;hed by con&s;cious guilt, &s;hrunk from farther parley and rode off in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem &s;trange that Mr. Falkland &s;hould thus a &s;econd time have been the &s;aviour of Mi&s;s Melvile, and that under circum&s;tances the mo&s;t unexpected and &s;ingular. But in this in&s;tance it is very ea&s;ily to be accounted for. He had heard of a man who lurked about this wood for robbery or &s;ome other bad de&s;ign, and that it was conjectured this man was Hawkins. Mr. Falkland's compa&s;&s;ion had already been &s;trongly intere&s;ted in behalf of this victim of rural tyranny; he had in vain en|deavoured to find him, and do him good; and he ea&s;ily conceived that, if the conjecture which had been made in this in&s;tance proved true, he might have it in his power not only to do what he had always intended, but farther to &s;ave from a peril|ous offence again&s;t the laws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ociety a man who
<PB N="107" REF="028752_0109_0FDBF076F73F3428">
appeared to have &s;trongly imbibed the principles of ju&s;tice and virtue. He took with him two &s;er|vants, becau&s;e, going with the expre&s;s de&s;ign of encountering robbers, if robbers &s;hould be found, he believed he &s;hould be inexcu&s;able if he did not go provided again&s;t po&s;&s;ible accidents. But he had directed them, at the &s;ame time that they kept within call, to be out of the reach of being &s;een; and it was only the eagerne&s;s of their zeal that had brought them up thus early in the pre&s;ent encoun|ter. Mr. Falkland had a little before had the op|portunity to convince him&s;elf that the village con|jecture in relation to Hawkins was untrue; and was now upon the point of returning home, with no other &s;atisfaction than that of having intended an act of benevolence, when Grimes and Emily came up to the &s;pot upon which he had po&s;ted him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This new adventure promi&s;ed &s;omething extra|ordinary. Mr. Falkland did not immediately re|cogni&s;e Mi&s;s Melvile, and the per&s;on of Grimes was that of a total &s;tranger whom he did not re|collect to have ever &s;een. But it was ea&s;y to un|der&s;tand the merits of the ca&s;e, and the propriety of interfering. The re&s;olute manner of Mr. Falk|land, combined with the dread which Grimes, op|pre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of wrong, entertained of the oppo&s;ition of &s;o elevated a per&s;onage, &s;peedily put the ravi&s;her to flight. Emily was le&s;t alone with her deliverer. He found her much more collected and calm than could rea&s;onably have been expected from a per&s;on who had been a moment before in the mo&s;t alarming &s;ituation. She told him of the place to which &s;he de&s;ired to be conveyed, and he immediately undertook to e&s;cort her. As they went along, &s;he recovered that &s;tate of mind which inclined her to make a per&s;on to whom &s;he had &s;uch repeated obligations, and who was &s;o emi|nently
<PB N="108" REF="028752_0110_0FDBF0385351B1A8">
the object of her admiration, acquainted with the events that had recently befallen her. Mr. Falkland li&s;tened with eagerne&s;s and &s;urpri&s;e. Though he had already known various in&s;tances of Mr. Tyrrel's mean jealou&s;y and unfeeling tyranny, this &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them all, and he could &s;carcely credit his ears while he heard the tale. His brutal neigh|bour &s;eemed to reali&s;e all that had ever been told of the pa&s;&s;ions of fiends. Mi&s;s Melvile was obliged to repeat in the cour&s;e of her tale her kin&s;man's rude accu&s;ation again&s;t her of entertaining a pa&s;|&s;ion for Mr. Falkland; and this &s;he did with the mo&s;t bewitching &s;implicity and charming confu&s;ion. Though this part of the tale was a &s;ource of real pain to her deliverer, yet it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed but that the flattering partiality of this unhappy girl increa&s;ed the intere&s;t he felt in her welfare and the indignation he conceived again&s;t her in|fernal kin&s;man.</P>
<P>They arrived without accident at the hou&s;e of the good lady under who&s;e protection Emily de|&s;ired to place her&s;elf. Here Mr. Falkland willingly left her as in a place of &s;ecurity. Such con&s;pira|cies as that of which &s;he was intended to have been the victim, depend for their &s;ucce&s;s upon the per&s;on again&s;t whom they are formed being out of the reach of help, and the moment they are de|tected they are annihilated. Such rea&s;oning will no doubt be generally found &s;ufficiently &s;olid, and it appeared to Mr. Falkland perfectly applicable to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. But he was mi&s;taken.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>MR. TYRREL heard with a&s;toni&s;hment of the mi&s;carriage of an expedient, of the &s;ucce&s;s of which he had not previou&s;ly entertained the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion. He became frantic with vexation. Grimes had not dared to &s;ignify the event of his expedition in per&s;on, and the footman whom he de&s;ired to announce to his ma&s;ter that Mi&s;s Mel|vile was lo&s;t, the moment after fled from his pre|&s;ence with the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ions. Pre|&s;ently he bellowed for Grimes, and the young man at la&s;t appeared before him, more dead than alive. Grimes he compelled to repeat the particulars of the tale, which he had no &s;ooner done than he once again &s;lunk away, &s;hocked at the execrations with which Mr. Tyrrel overwhelmed him. Grimes was no coward; but he reverenced the inborn divinity that attends upon rank, as Indians wor&s;hip the devil. Nor was this all. The rage of Mr. Tyrrel was &s;o ungovernable and fierce, that few hearts could have been found &s;o &s;tout as not to have trembled before it with a &s;ort of unconquer|able inferiority.</P>
<P>He no &s;ooner obtained a moment's pau&s;e than he began to recal to his tempe&s;tuous mind the various circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e. His complaints were bitter; and in a tranquil ob&s;erver might have produced the united feeling of pity for his &s;uffer|ings and horror at his depravity. He recollected all the precautions he had u&s;ed; he could &s;carcely find a flaw in the proce&s;s; and he cur&s;ed that blind and malicious power that delighted to cro&s;s his mo&s;t deep laid de&s;igns. Of this malice he was
<PB N="110" REF="028752_0112_0FDBF03C795DAF28">
beyond all other human beings the object. He was mocked with the &s;hadow of power; and, when he lifted his hand to &s;mite, it was &s;truck with &s;udden pal&s;y. To what purpo&s;e had heaven given him a feeling of injury and an in&s;tinct to re&s;ent, while he could in no ca&s;e make his re&s;ent|ment felt! It was only nece&s;&s;ary for him to be the enemy of any per&s;on, in order to that per&s;on's being in&s;ured again&s;t the reach of misfortune. What in&s;ults, the mo&s;t &s;hocking and repeated, had he not received from this paltry girl? And by whom was &s;he now torn from his indignation? By that devil that haunted him at every moment, that cro&s;&s;ed him at every &s;tep, that fixed at plea&s;ure his arrows in his heart, and made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ows and mockery at his in&s;ufferable tortures.</P>
<P>There was one other reflexion that increa&s;ed his angui&s;h, and made him carele&s;s and de&s;perate as to his future conduct. It was in vain to conceal from him&s;elf that his reputation would be cruelly wounded by this event. He had imagined that, while Emily was forced into this odious marriage, &s;he would be obliged by decorum, as &s;oon as the event was decided, to draw a veil over the com|pul&s;ion &s;he had &s;uffered. But this &s;ecurity was now lo&s;t, and Mr. Falkland would take a pride in publi&s;hing his di&s;honour. Though the provoca|tions he had received from Mi&s;s Melvile would in his opinion have ju&s;tified him in any treatment he &s;hould have thought proper to inflict, he was &s;en&s;i|ble the world would &s;ee the matter in a very dif|ferent light. This reflection augmented the vio|lence of his re&s;olutions, and determined him to refu&s;e no means by which he could transfer the angui&s;h that now preyed upon his own mind to that of another.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the compo&s;ure and magnanimity of Emily had con&s;iderably &s;ub&s;ided, the moment &s;he
<PB N="111" REF="028752_0113_0FDBF0799DAC38D0">
believed her&s;elf in a place of &s;afety. While dan|ger and inju&s;tice a&s;&s;ailed her with their menaces, &s;he found in her&s;elf a courage that di&s;dained to yield. The &s;ucceeding appearance of calm was more fatal to her. There was nothing now power|fully to fo&s;ter her courage, or excite her energy. She looked back at the trials &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed, and her &s;oul &s;ickened at the recollection of that which, while it was in act, &s;he had had the fortitude to endure. Till the period at which Mr. Tyrrel had been in&s;pired with this cruel antipathy, &s;he had been in all in&s;tances a &s;tranger to anxiety and fear. Uninured to misfortune, &s;he had &s;uddenly and without preparation been made the &s;ubject of the mo&s;t infernal malignity. When a man of robu&s;t and vigorous con&s;titution has a fit of &s;ickne&s;s, it produces a much more powerful effect than the &s;ame indi&s;po&s;ition upon a delicate valetudinarian. Such was the ca&s;e with Mi&s;s Melvile. She pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ucceeding night &s;leeple&s;s and unea&s;y, and was found in the morning with a high fever. Her di&s;temper re&s;i&s;ted for the pre&s;ent all attempts to a&s;&s;uage it, though there was rea&s;on to hope that the goodne&s;s of her con&s;titution, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by tran|quillity and the kindne&s;s of tho&s;e about her, would ultimately &s;urmount it. On the &s;econd day &s;he was delirious. On the night of that day &s;he was ar|re&s;ted at the &s;uit of Mr. Tyrrel for a debt contract|ed for board and nece&s;&s;aries for the fourteen la&s;t years.</P>
<P>The idea of this arre&s;t, as the reader will per|haps recollect, fir&s;t occurred in the conver&s;ation between Mr. Tyrrel and Mi&s;s Melvile &s;oon after he had thought proper to confine her to her cham|ber. But at that time he had probably had no &s;erious conception of ever being induced to carry it into execution. It had merely been mentioned by way of threat, and as the &s;ugge&s;tion of a mind who&s;e
<PB N="112" REF="028752_0114_0FDBF03D95E62BB0">
habits had been long familiari&s;ed to the recollection of every po&s;&s;ible medium of tyranny and revenge. But now that the unlooked-for re&s;cue and e&s;cape of his poor kin&s;woman had wrought up the thoughts of Mr. Tyrrel to a degree of in&s;anity, and he re|volved in the gloomy re&s;ources of his mind how he might mo&s;t effectually &s;hake off the load of di&s;ap|pointment that oppre&s;&s;ed him, the idea recurred with double force. He was not long in forming his re&s;olution; and, calling for Barnes, his &s;teward, immediately gave him directions in what manner to proceed.</P>
<P>Barnes had been for &s;everal years the in&s;trument of Mr. Tyrrel's inju&s;tice. His mind was hardened by u&s;e, and he could without remor&s;e officiate as the &s;pectator, or even as the immediate author and director of a &s;cene of vulgar di&s;tre&s;s. But even he was &s;omewhat &s;tartled upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. The character and conduct of Emily in Mr. Tyrrel's family had been without a blot. She had not a &s;ingle enemy; and it was impo&s;&s;ible to contemplate her youth, her harmle&s;s vivacity, her guilele&s;s innocence, without emotions of &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Your wor&s;hip?&mdash;I do not under&s;tand you!&mdash;Arre&s;t mi&s;s!&mdash;mi&s;s Emily!</P>
<P>Yes, I tell you! What is the matter with you? Go immediately to Swineard, the lawyer, and bid him fini&s;h the bu&s;ine&s;s out of hand!</P>
<P>Lord love your honour! Arre&s;t her! Why, &s;he does not owe you a bra&s;s farthing; &s;he always lived upon your charity!</P>
<P>A&s;s! Scoundrel! I tell you &s;he does owe me, owes me&mdash;eleven hundred pound.&mdash;The law ju&s;ti|fies it.&mdash;What do you think laws were made for?&mdash;I do nothing but right, and my rights I will have.</P>

Your honour, I never que&s;tioned your orders in my life; but I mu&s;t now. I cannot &s;ee you ruin mi&s;s Emily, poor girl! nay, and your&s;elf too, for the matter of that, and not &s;ay which way you are going. I hope you will bear with me. Why if &s;he owed you ever &s;o much, &s;he cannot be ar|re&s;ted. She is not of age.</P>
<P>Will you have done, &s;ir? Do not tell me of It cannot&punc; and It can. To my knowledge it has been done before, and it &s;hall be done again. Let him di&s;pute it that dares.

<P>Pray, your honour, think better of it. Upon my life, the whole country will cry &s;hame of it.</P>
<P>Barnes?&mdash;What do you mean? I am not u&s;ed to be talked to, and I will not bear it!&mdash;They have driven me already with their parleying and their di&s;obedience to the very end of my patience. You have been a good fellow to me upon many occa&s;ions. But, if I find you out for making one with them that di&s;pute my authority, damn my &s;oul, if I do not make you &s;ick of your very life!</P>
<P>I have done, your honour. I will not &s;ay ano|ther word, except this. I have heard as how that mi&s;s Emily is &s;ick a-bed. You are determined, you &s;ay, to put her in jail. You do not mean to kill her, I take it.</P>
<P>Let her die, if &s;he will! I will not &s;pare her for an hour. I will not always be in&s;ulted. She had no con&s;ideration for me, and I have no mercy for her. I am in for it! They have provoked me pa&s;t all bearing, and they &s;hall feel me! Tell Swineard, in bed or up, day or night, I will not have him hear of a minute's delay.</P>

Such were the directions of Mr. Tyrrel, and in &s;trict conformity to his directions were the pro|ceedings of that re&s;pectable limb of the law he em|ployed upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. Mi&s;s Melvile had been delirious through a con&s;iderable part of the day on the evening of which the bailiff and his follower arrived. By the direction of the phy&s;ician whom Mr. Falkland had ordered to attend her, a compo&s;ing draught was admini&s;tered; and, ex|hau&s;ted as &s;he was by the wild and di&s;tracted images that for &s;everal hours had haunted her fancy, &s;he was now &s;unk into a refre&s;hing &s;lumber. Mrs. Hammond, the &s;i&s;ter of Mrs. Jakeman, was &s;itting by her bed-&s;ide, full of compa&s;&s;ion for the lovely &s;ufferer, and rejoicing in the calm tranquillity that had ju&s;t taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her, when a little girl, the only child of Mrs. Hammond, opened the &s;treet-door to the tap of the bailiff. He &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e wanted to &s;peak with mi&s;s Melvile, and the child an&s;wered that &s;he would go tell her mother. So &s;aying, &s;he advanced to the door of the back-room upon the ground-floor in which Emily lay; but the moment it was opened, in&s;tead of waiting for the appearance of the mother, the bailiff entered along with the girl.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hammond looked up. Who are you, &s;aid &s;he? Why do you come in here? Hu&s;h! be quiet!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;peak with mi&s;s Melvile.</P>
<P>Indeed, but you mu&s;t not. Tell me your bu&s;i|ne&s;s. The poor lady has been light-headed all day. She is ju&s;t fallen a&s;leep, and mu&s;t not be di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>That is no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine. I mu&s;t obey orders.</P>
<P>Orders? Who&s;e orders? What is it you mean?</P>
<P>At this moment Emily opened her eyes. What noi&s;e is that? I wi&s;h you would let me be quiet.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="028752_0117_0FDBF081D6588520">
Mi&s;s, I want to &s;peak with you. I have got a writ again&s;t you for eleven hundred pound at the &s;uit of &s;quire Tyrrel.</P>
<P>At the&s;e words both Mrs. Hammond and Emily were dumb. The latter was &s;carcely able to annex any meaning to the intelligence; and, though Mrs. Hammond was &s;omewhat better acquainted with the &s;ort of language that was employed, yet in this &s;trange and unexpected connexion it was almo&s;t as my&s;terious to her, as to poor Emily her&s;elf.</P>
<P>A writ! How can &s;he be in Mr. Tyrrel's debt? A writ again&s;t a child!</P>
<P>It is no &s;ignification putting your que&s;tions to us. We only do as we are directed. There is our au|thority. Look at it.</P>
<P>Lord Almighty! exclaimed Mrs. Hammond, what does this mean? It is impo&s;&s;ible Mr. Tyrrel &s;hould have &s;ent you.</P>
<P>Good woman, none of your jabber to us! Can|not you read?</P>
<P>This is all a trick! This paper is forged! It is a vile contrivance to get the poor lady out of the hands of tho&s;e with whom only &s;he can be &s;afe. Proceed upon it at your peril!</P>
<P>Re&s;t you content; that is exactly what we mean to do. Take it at my word, we know very well what we are about.</P>
<P>Why, you would not tear her from her bed? I tell you, &s;he is in a high fever; &s;he is light-headed; it would be death to remove her! You are bailiffs, are not you? You are not murderers?</P>
<P>The law &s;ays nothing about that. We have or|ders to take her &s;ick or well. We will do her no harm; except &s;o far as we mu&s;t perform our office, be it how it will.</P>
<P>Where would you take her? What is it you mean to do?</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="028752_0118_0FDBF04352B29F00">
To the county jail. Bullock, go, order a po&s;t-chai&s;e from the Griffin!</P>
<P>Stay, I &s;ay! Give no &s;uch orders! Wait only three hours; I will &s;end off a me&s;&s;enger expre&s;s to &s;quire Falkland, and I am &s;ure he will &s;a|tisfy you as to any harm that can come to you, without its being nece&s;&s;ary to take the poor lady to jail.</P>
<P>We have particular directions again&s;t that. We are not at liberty to lo&s;e a minute. Why are not you gone? Order the hor&s;es to be put to imme|diately!</P>
<P>Emily had li&s;tened to the cour&s;e of this conver|&s;ation, which had &s;ufficiently explained to her whatever was enigmatical at the fir&s;t appearance of the bailiffs. The painful and incredible reality that was thus pre&s;ented, effectually di&s;&s;ipated the illu|&s;ions of frenzy to which &s;he had ju&s;t been a prey. My dear madam, &s;aid &s;he to Mrs. Hammond, do not hara&s;s your&s;elf with u&s;ele&s;s efforts. I am very &s;orry for all the trouble I have given you. But my misfortune is inevitable. Sir, if you will &s;tep into the next room, I will dre&s;s my&s;elf, and attend you immediately.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hammond began to be equally aware that her &s;truggles were to no purpo&s;e; but &s;he could not be equally patient. At one moment &s;he raved upon the brutality of Mr. Tyrrel, whom &s;he affirm|ed to be a devil incarnate, and not a man. At another &s;he expo&s;tulated with bitter invective again&s;t the hard-heartedne&s;s of the bailiff, and ex|horted him to mix &s;ome humanity and moderation with the di&s;charge of his duty; but he was impe|netrable to all &s;he could urge. In the mean while Emily yielded with the &s;weete&s;t re&s;ignation to an inevitable evil. Mrs. Hammond in&s;i&s;ted that at lea&s;t they &s;hould permit her to attend her young lady in the chai&s;e; and the bailiff, though the or|ders
<PB N="117" REF="028752_0119_0FDBF08762EE17C8">
he had received were &s;o peremptory that he dared not exerci&s;e his di&s;cretion as to the execution of the writ, began to have &s;ome apprehen&s;ions of danger, and was willing to admit of any precau|tion that was not in direct ho&s;tility to his func|tions. For the re&s;t he under&s;tood, that it was in all ca&s;es dangerous to allow &s;ickne&s;s, or apparent unfitne&s;s for removal as a &s;ufficient cau&s;e to inter|rupt a direct proce&s;s, and that accordingly in all doubtful que&s;tions and pre&s;umptive murders the practice of the law inclined [with a laudable par|tiality] to the vindication of its own officers. In addition to the&s;e general rules he was influenced by the po&s;itive injunctions and a&s;&s;urances of Swine|ard, and the terror which univer&s;ally through a circle of many miles was annexed to the name of Tyrrel. Before they departed Mrs. Hammond di&s;|patched a me&s;&s;enger with a letter of three lines to Mr. Falkland informing him of this extraordinary event. Mr. Falkland was from home when the me&s;&s;enger arrived, and not expected to return till the &s;econd day; accident &s;eeming in this in&s;tance to favour the vengeance of Mr. Tyrrel, for he had him&s;elf been too much under the dominion of an uncontroulable fury to have lei&s;ure to take a cir|cum&s;tance of this &s;ort into his e&s;timate.</P>
<P>The forlorn &s;tate of the&s;e poor women, who were conducted, the one by compul&s;ion, the other as a volunteer, to a &s;cene &s;o little adapted to their accommodation as that of a common jail, may ea&s;ily be imagined. There were however a ma&s;cu|line courage and impetuo&s;ity of &s;pirit in Mrs. Hammond, eminently nece&s;&s;ary in the difficulties they had to encounter. She was in &s;ome degree &s;itted by a &s;anguine temper and an impa&s;&s;ioned &s;en&s;e of inju&s;tice for the di&s;charge of tho&s;e very offices which &s;obriety and calm reflexion might pre&s;cribe. The health of mi&s;s Melvile, as might
<PB N="118" REF="028752_0120_0FDBF044528B19D0">
have been expected, was very materially affected by the &s;urpri&s;e and removal &s;he had undergone, at the very time when repo&s;e was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for her pre&s;ervation. Her fever became more violent than ever; her delirium was &s;tronger; and the tor|tures of her imagination were in &s;ome degree pro|portioned to the extreme unfavourablene&s;s of the &s;tate in which the removal had been effected. It was highly improbable &s;he could at all recover.</P>
<P>In the moments of &s;u&s;pended rea&s;on &s;he was perpetually calling on the name of Mr. Falkland. Mr. Falkland, &s;he &s;aid, was her fir&s;t and only love, and he &s;hould be her hu&s;band. A moment after|wards &s;he exclaimed upon him in a di&s;con&s;olate, yet reproachful tone, for his unworthy deference to the prejudices of the world. It was very cruel of him to &s;hew him&s;elf &s;o proud, and tell her that he would never con&s;ent to marry a beggar. But, if he were proud, &s;he was determined to be proud too. He &s;hould &s;ee that &s;he would not demean her&s;elf like a &s;lighted maiden, and that, though he could reject her, it was not in his power to break her heart. At another time &s;he imagined &s;he &s;aw Mr. Tyrrel and his engine Grimes, their hands and garments dropping with blood, and the pathetic reproaches &s;he vented again&s;t them might have af|fected a heart of &s;tone. Then the figure of Falk|land pre&s;ented it&s;elf to her di&s;tracted fancy, de|formed with wounds and of a deadly palene&s;s, and &s;he &s;hrieked with agony, while &s;he exclaimed that &s;uch was the general hard-heartedne&s;s, that no one would make the &s;malle&s;t exertion for his re&s;cue. In &s;uch vici&s;&s;itudes of pain, perpetually imagining to her&s;elf unkindne&s;s, in&s;ult, con&s;piracy and murder, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable part of two days.</P>
<P>On the evening of the &s;econd Mr. Falkland ar|rived, accompanied by doctor Arnold, the phy&s;i|cian by whom &s;he had previou&s;ly been attended.
<PB N="119" REF="028752_0121_0FDBF08954C18D88">
The &s;cene he was called upon to witne&s;s was &s;uch as to be mo&s;t exqui&s;itely agonizing to a man of his acute &s;en&s;ibility. The news of the arre&s;t had given him an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;hock; he was tran&s;ported out of him&s;elf at the unexampled malignity of its author. But, when he &s;aw the figure of Mi&s;s Melvile, haggard, and a warrant of death written in her countenance, a victim to the diabolical pa&s;|&s;ions of her kin&s;man, the &s;cene &s;eemed too much to be endured. When he entered, &s;he was in the mid&s;t of one of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">its of delirium, and immedi|ately mi&s;took her vi&s;itors for two a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. She a&s;ked, where they had hid her Falkland, her lord, her life, her hu&s;band! and demanded that they &s;hould re&s;tore to her his mangled corp&s;e, that &s;he might embrace him with her dying arms, breathe her la&s;t upon his lips, and be buried in the &s;ame grave. She reproached them with the &s;ordidne&s;s of their conduct in becoming the tools of her vile cou&s;in, who had deprived her of her rea&s;on, and would never be contented, till he had murdered her. Mr. Falkland tore him&s;elf away from this painful &s;cene, and, leaving doctor Arnold with his patient, de&s;ired him when he had given the nece&s;&s;ary di|rections to follow him to his inn.</P>
<P>The perpetual hurry of &s;pirits in which Mi&s;s Melvile had for &s;everal days been kept by the na|ture of her indi&s;po&s;ition was extremely exhau&s;ting to her; and in about an hour from the vi&s;it of Mr. Falkland her delirium &s;ub&s;ided, and left her in &s;o low a &s;tate as to render it difficult to perceive any marks of life. Doctor Arnold, who had before withdrawn, to &s;oothe, if po&s;&s;ible, the di&s;turbed and impatient thoughts of Mr. Falkland, was &s;um|moned afre&s;h upon this change of &s;ymptoms, and &s;at by the bed-&s;ide during <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> remainder of the night. The &s;ituation of his patient was &s;uch as to keep him in momentary apprehen&s;ion of her de|cea&s;e.
<PB N="120" REF="028752_0122_0FDBF0493A8EF780">
While Mi&s;s Melvile lay in this feeble and exhau&s;ted condition, Mrs. Hammond betrayed every token of the tendere&s;t, anxiety. Her &s;en&s;i|bility was habitually of the acute&s;t &s;ort, and the qualities of Emily were &s;uch as powerfully to fix her affection. She loved her like a mother, Upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion every &s;ound, every motion made her tremble. Doctor Arnold had introduced another nur&s;e in con&s;ideration of the ince&s;&s;ant fa|tigue Mrs. Hammond had undergone; and he en|deavoured by repre&s;entations and even by autho|rity to compel her to quit the apartment of the pa|tient. But &s;he was uncontroulable; and he at length found that he &s;hould probably do her more injury by the violence that would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eparate her from the &s;uffering innocent, than by allowing her to follow her own inclinations. Her eye was a thou&s;and times turned with the mo&s;t eager curio&s;ity upon the countenance of doctor Arnold, without her daring to breathe a que&s;tion re&s;pecting his opinion, le&s;t he &s;hould an&s;wer her by a communication of the mo&s;t fatal tidings. In the mean time &s;he li&s;tened with the deepe&s;t atten|tion to every thing that dropped either from the phy&s;ician or the nur&s;e, hoping as it were to collect from &s;ome oblique hint the intelligence which &s;he had not courage expre&s;sly to require.</P>
<P>Towards morning the &s;tate of the patient &s;eemed to take a favourable turn. She dozed for near two hours, and, when &s;he awoke, appeared perfectly calm and &s;en&s;ible. Under&s;tanding that Mr. Falk|land had brought the phy&s;ician to attend her, and was him&s;elf in the neighbourhood, &s;he reque&s;ted to &s;ee him. Mr. Falkland had gone in the mean time with one of his tenants to bail the debt, and now entered the pri&s;on to enquire whether the young lady might be &s;afely removed from her pre&s;ent mi|&s;erable re&s;idence to a more airy and commodious
<PB N="121" REF="028752_0123_0FDBF08D751E6F38">
apartment. When he appeared, the &s;ight of him revived in the mind of Mi&s;s Melvile an imperfect rencollection of the wanderings of her delirium. She covered her face with her hand, and betrayed the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive confu&s;ion, while &s;he thanked him with her u&s;ual unaffected &s;implicity for all the trouble he had taken. She hoped &s;he &s;hould not give him much more; &s;he thought &s;he &s;hould get better. It was a &s;hame, &s;he &s;aid, if a young and lively girl as &s;he was, could not contrive to outlive the trifling misfortunes to which &s;he had been &s;ub|jected. But, while &s;he &s;aid this, &s;he was &s;till ex|tremely weak. She tried to a&s;&s;ume a chearful countenance; but it was a faint effort, which the feeble &s;tate of her frame did not &s;eem &s;ufficient to &s;upport. Mr. Falkland and the doctor joined to reque&s;t her to keep her&s;elf quiet, and to avoid for the pre&s;ent all occa&s;ions of exertion.</P>
<P>Encouraged by the&s;e appearances, Mrs. Ham|mond now ventured to follow the two gentlemen out of the room in order to learn from the phy&s;i|cian what hopes he entertained. Doctor Arnold acknowledged that he had found his patient at fir&s;t in a very unfavourable &s;ituation, that the &s;ymptoms were changed for the better, and that he was not without &s;ome expectation of her recovery. He added however, that he could an&s;wer for nothing, that the next twelve hours would be exceedingly critical, but that, if &s;he did not grow wor&s;e be|fore morning, he would then undertake to an&s;wer for her life. Mrs. Hammond, who had hitherto &s;een nothing but de&s;pair, now became frantic with joy. She bur&s;t into tears of tran&s;port, ble&s;&s;ed the phy&s;ician in the mo&s;t emphatic and impa&s;&s;ioned terms, and uttered a thou&s;and extravagancies. Doctor Arnold &s;eized this opportunity to pre&s;s her to give her&s;elf a little repo&s;e, to which &s;he con&s;ent|ed, a chamber being fir&s;t procured for her next to
<PB N="122" REF="028752_0124_0FDBF04B14B61FC0">
that of Mi&s;s Melvile, and &s;he having charged the nur&s;e to give her notice of any alteration in the patient.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hammond enjoyed an uninterrupted &s;leep of &s;everal hours, when towards the afternoon, &s;he was alarmed by an unu&s;ual bu&s;tle in the next room. She li&s;tened for a few moments, and then deter|mined to go and &s;ee what was the occa&s;ion of it. As &s;he opened her door for that purpo&s;e, &s;he met the nur&s;e who was coming to her. The counte|nance of the me&s;&s;enger told her what it was &s;he had to communicate, without the u&s;e of words. She hurried to the bed &s;ide, and found Mi&s;s Mel|vile expiring. The appearances that had at fir&s;t been &s;o encouraging were but of &s;hort duration. The calm of the morning proved to be only a &s;ort of lightning before death. In a few hours the patient grew wor&s;e. The bloom of her counte|nance faded; &s;he drew her breath with difficulty; and her eyes became fixed. Doctor Arnold had come in at this period, and had immediately per|ceived that all was over. She was for &s;ome time in convul&s;ions; but, the&s;e &s;ub&s;iding, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed the phy&s;ician with a compo&s;ed, though feeble voice. She thanked him for his attention; and expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t lively &s;en&s;e of her obligations to Mr. Falkland. She &s;incerely forgave her cou&s;in, and hoped he might never be vi&s;ited by too acute a recollection of his barbarity to her. She would have been contented to live; few per&s;ons had a &s;incerer reli&s;h of the good things of life; but &s;he was well plea&s;ed to die rather than have become the wife of Grimes. As Mrs. Hammond entered, &s;he turned her countenance towards her, and with an affectionate expre&s;&s;ion repeated her name. The&s;e were her la&s;t words; in le&s;s than two hours from that time &s;he breathed her la&s;t in the arms of this faithful friend.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH was the fate of Mi&s;s Emily Melvile. Perhaps tyranny never exhibited a more painful memorial of the dete&s;tation in which it de&s;erves to be held. The idea irre&s;i&s;tibly excited in every &s;pectator of the &s;cene was that of regarding Mr. Tyrrel as the mo&s;t diabolical wretch that had ever di&s;honoured the human form. The very attendants upon this hou&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion, for the &s;cene was acted upon too public a &s;tage not to be generally under&s;tood, expre&s;&s;ed their a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;|gu&s;t at his unparalleled cruelty. If &s;uch were the feelings of men bred to the commi&s;&s;ion of inju&s;tice, it is ea&s;y to conceive what mu&s;t have been tho&s;e of Mr. Falkland. His whole life had tended to culti|vate in him a mind tremblingly alive to moral good and evil. Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions he was unable ma|turely to collect his thoughts and firmly re&s;olve upon the proceeding which the nature of the ca&s;e required. His habits urged him to madne&s;s and ungovernable fury. He could not think of &s;uch complicated depravity but with &s;entiments of pre|ternatural loathing and horror. Perhaps the ago|nies of the wretch broken upon the wheel, whom the very fir&s;t &s;ight of that engine of torture had thrown into convul&s;ions, did not exceed tho&s;e of Mr. Falkland in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation. He was therefore deprived for a time of all that compo&s;ure of mind which is requi&s;ite to enable us to act with di&s;cretion. It was nece&s;&s;ary to guard him like a madman. The whole office of judging what was
<PB N="124" REF="028752_0126_0FDBF05189AC70C0">
proper to be done under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances devolved upon doctor Arnold.</P>
<P>The doctor was a man of cool and methodical habits of acting. One of the fir&s;t ideas that &s;ug|ge&s;ted it&s;elf to him was, that Mi&s;s Melvile was a branch of the family of Tyrrel. He did not doubt of the willingne&s;s of Mr. Falkland to di&s;|charge every expence that might be farther incident to the melancholy remains of this unfortunate victim; but he &s;u&s;pected that the laws of fa&s;hion and decorum required that &s;ome notification of the event &s;hould be made to the head of the family&punc; His manners were formal, his temper phlegmatic, and his whole character was &s;uch as to render him little &s;u&s;ceptible of tho&s;e impetuous impul&s;es which have &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;hare in the hi&s;tory of the ma&s;s of mankind. Perhaps too he had an eye to his own intere&s;t in his profe&s;&s;ion, and was reluc|tant to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the re&s;entment of a per|&s;on of Mr. Tyrrel's con&s;ideration in the neighbour|hood. Inacce&s;&s;ible to the &s;ympathies of the mind, he was little qualified to calculate their operation in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. But, with this weakne&s;s, he had neverthele&s;s &s;ome feelings in common with the re&s;t of the world, and mu&s;t have &s;uffered a con|&s;iderable degree of violence before he could have per&s;uaded him&s;elf to be the me&s;&s;enger; be&s;ide which he did not think it right in the pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation to leave Mr. Falkland.</P>
<P>Doctor Arnold no &s;ooner mentioned the&s;e ideas, than they &s;eemed to make a &s;udden impre&s;&s;ion on Mrs. Hammond, and &s;he earne&s;tly reque&s;ted that &s;he might be permitted to carry the intelligence. The propo&s;al was unexpected; but the doctor did not very ob&s;tinately refu&s;e his a&s;&s;ent. She was de|termined, &s;he &s;aid, to &s;ee what &s;ort of impre&s;&s;ion the cata&s;trophe would make upon the author of it; and &s;he promi&s;ed to comport her&s;elf with modera|tion and civility. The journey was &s;oon per|formed.</P>

I am &s;ure&mdash;I hope&mdash;&s;he is not dead!&mdash;Tell me that you have only been deceiving me, and I will forgive you every thing.&mdash;I will forgive her&mdash;I will take her into favour&mdash;I will do any thing you plea&s;e!&mdash;I never meant her any harm!</P>
<P>I tell you, &s;ir, &s;he is dead! You have murdered the &s;weete&s;t lady that lived! Can you bring her back to life, as you have driven her out of it? If you could, I would kneel to you twenty times a day!&mdash;What is it you have done? Mi&s;erable wretch! did you think you could do and undo, and change the laws of nature, as you plea&s;e?</P>
<P>If &s;he is dead,&mdash;what care I? It is no concern of mine. Did I tell her to run away? I meant every thing for her good. If &s;he took things to heart &s;o, as to die of the pip like a chicken, is that my fault?</P>
<P>The reproaches of Mrs. Hammond were the fir&s;t in&s;tance in which Mr. Tyrrel was made to drink the full cup of retribution. This was however only a &s;pecimen of a long &s;eries of contempt, ab|horrence and in&s;ult that was re&s;erved for him. The words of Mrs. Hammond were prophetic. It evidently appeared that, though wealth and here|ditary elevation operate as an apology for many delinquencies, there are &s;ome which &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly addre&s;s them&s;elves to the indignation of mankind, that, like death, they level all di&s;tinctions, and reduce their perpetrator to an equality with the
<PB N="127" REF="028752_0129_0FDBF0961380C088">
mo&s;t indigent and &s;qualid of his &s;pecies. Again&s;t Mr. Tyrrel, as the tyrannical and unmanly mur|derer of Emily, tho&s;e who dared not venture the unre&s;erved avowal of their &s;entiments, muttered cur&s;es, deep, not loud; while the re&s;t joined in an univer&s;al cry of abhorrence and execration. He him&s;elf &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed at the novelty of his &s;itu|ation. Accu&s;tomed as he had been to the obe|dience and trembling homage of mankind, he had imagined they would be perpetual, and that no exce&s;s on his part would ever be potent enough to break the enchantment. Now he looked round and &s;aw &s;ullen dete&s;tation in every face, which with difficulty re&s;trained it&s;elf, and upon the &s;light|e&s;t provocation broke forth with an impetuous tide, and &s;wept away all the mounds of &s;ubordi|nation and fear. His large e&s;tate could not n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w purcha&s;e civility from the gentry, the pea&s;antry, &s;carcely from his own &s;ervants. In the indignation of all around him he found a gho&s;t that haunted him with every change of place, and a remor&s;e that &s;tung his con&s;cience and exterminated his peace. The neighbourhood appeared more and more every day to be growing too hot for him to endure the fiercene&s;s of its temperature, and it became evident that he would ultimately be obliged to quit the country. Urged by the flagitiou&s;ne&s;s of this la&s;t example, people learned to recollect every other in&s;tance of Mr. Tyrrel's exce&s;&s;es, and upon the whole it was no doubt a fearful cata|logue of wanton inju&s;tice that now ro&s;e up in judgment again&s;t him. It &s;eemed as if the &s;en&s;e of public re&s;entment had been long gathering &s;trength unperceived, and now at length bur&s;t forth into inextingui&s;hable violence.</P>
<P>There was &s;carcely a human being upon whom this &s;ort of retribution could have &s;at more un|ea&s;ily than upon Mr. Tyrrel. Though he had not
<PB N="128" REF="028752_0130_0FDBF056D6014148">
a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of innocence prompting him con|tinually to recoil from the dete&s;tation of mankind as a thing totally unallied to his character, yet the imperiou&s;ne&s;s of his temper and the con&s;tant ex|perience he had had of the pliability of other men, prepared him to feel the general and undi&s;gui&s;ed condemnation into which he was &s;unk with un|common emotions of anger and impatience. That he, at the beam of who&s;e eye every countenance fell, and whom in the fiercene&s;s of his wrath no one was daring enough to an&s;wer, &s;hould now be regarded with avowed di&s;like and treated with un|ceremonious cen&s;ure, was a thing he could not endure to recollect or believe. Symptoms of the univer&s;al di&s;gu&s;t &s;mote him at every in&s;tant, and at every blow he writhed with intolerable angui&s;h. His rage was unbounded and raving. He repelled every attack with the fierce&s;t indignation; while the more he &s;truggled, the more de&s;perate his &s;itu|ation appeared to become. At length he deter|mined to collect his &s;trength for a deci&s;ive effort, and to meet the whole tide of public opinion in a &s;ingle &s;cene.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the&s;e thoughts he re&s;olved to repair without delay to the rural a&s;&s;embly which I have already mentioned in the cour&s;e of my hi&s;tory. Mi&s;s Melvile had now been dead one month. There was a &s;ort of bu&s;tle that took place at his entrance, it having been agreed by a private vote among the gentlemen of the a&s;&s;embly that Mr. Tyrrel was to be refu&s;ed admittance, as a per&s;on with whom they did not choo&s;e to a&s;&s;ociate. This vote had already been notified to him by letter by the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, but the intelligence was rather calculated to a man of Mr. Tyrrel's di&s;po&s;ition to excite defiance than to overawe. At the door of the a&s;&s;embly he was per&s;onally met by the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, who had perceived
<PB N="129" REF="028752_0131_0FDBF09C18148D00">
the arrival of an equipage, and who now endea|voured to repeat his prohibition; but he was thru&s;t a&s;ide by Mr. Tyrrel with an air of native autho|rity and ineffable contempt. As he entered, every eye was turned upon him. Pre&s;ently all the gen|tlemen in the room a&s;&s;embled round him. Some endeavored to hu&s;tle him, and others began to expo&s;tulate. But he found the &s;ecret effectually to &s;ilence the one &s;et, and to &s;hake off the other. His mu&s;cular form, the well-known eminence of his intellectual powers, the long habits to which every man was formed of acknowledging his a&s;|cendancy, were all in his favour. He con&s;idered him&s;elf as playing a de&s;perate &s;take, and had rou&s;ed all the energies he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to enable him to do ju&s;tice to &s;o intere&s;ting a tran&s;action. Di&s;engaged from the in&s;ects that had at fir&s;t pe&s;tered him, he paced up and down the room with a magi&s;terial &s;tride, and fla&s;hed an angry glance on every &s;ide. He then broke &s;ilence. "If any one had any thing to &s;ay to him, he &s;hould know where and how to an&s;wer him. He would advi&s;e any &s;uch per&s;on however to con&s;ider well what he was about. If any man imagined he had any thing per&s;onally to complain of, it was very well. But he did expect that nobody there would be igno|rant and raw enough to meddle with what was no bu&s;ine&s;s of theirs, and intrude into the concerns of any man's private family".</P>
<P>This being a &s;ort of defiance, one and another gentleman advanced to an&s;wer it. He that was fir&s;t began to &s;peak; but Mr. Tyrrel, by the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of his countenance and a peremptory tone, by well-timed interruptions and pertinent in&s;inu|ations, cau&s;ed him fir&s;t to he&s;itate, and then to be &s;ilent. He &s;eemed to be fa&s;t advancing to the triumph he had promi&s;ed him&s;elf. The whole company were a&s;toni&s;hed. They felt the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame ab|horrence
<PB N="130" REF="028752_0132_0FDBF057D67F8D50">
and condemnation of his character; but they could not help admiring the courage and re|&s;ources he di&s;played upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. They could without difficulty have concentred afre&s;h their indignant feelings, but they &s;eemed to want a leader.</P>
<P>At this critical moment Mr. Falkland entered the room. He had been ab&s;ent the la&s;t week in a di&s;tant part of the country, and was now return|ed two or three days &s;ooner than he expected, Mr. Tyrrel had willingly embraced this oppor|tunity, tru&s;ting that, if he could now effect his re|e&s;tabli&s;hment, he &s;hould ea&s;ily pre&s;erve the ground he had regained even in the face of his mo&s;t for|midable rival. Mr. Tyrrel was certainly not defi|cient in courage; but he conceived that the pre&s;ent was too important an epocha in his life to allow him to make any unnece&s;&s;ary ri&s;k in his chance for future ea&s;e and importance. He would gladly have di&s;pen&s;ed with the arrival of the new comer.</P>
<P>Both he and Mr. Falkland reddened at &s;ight of each other. Mr. Falkland advanced towards him without a moment's pau&s;e, and in a peremptory voice a&s;ked him, what he did here?</P>
<P>Here! What do you mean by that? This place is as free to me as you, and you are the la&s;t per&s;on to whom I &s;hall deign to give an account of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sir, the place is not free to you. Do not you know you have been voted out? Whatever were your rights, your infamous conduct has forfeited them.</P>
<P>Mr. what do you call your&s;elf, if you have any thing to &s;ay to me, choo&s;e a proper time and place. Do not think to put on your bullying airs under &s;helter of this company! I will not endure it.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="028752_0133_0FDBF09D92A6EAE8">
You are mi&s;taken, &s;ir. This public &s;cene is the only place where I can have any thing to &s;ay to you. If you would not hear of the univer&s;al in|dignation of mankind, you mu&s;t not come into the &s;ociety of men. Mi&s;s Melvile! Shame upon you, inhuman, unrelenting tyrant! Can you hear her name, and not &s;ink into the earth? Can you re|tire into &s;olitude, and not &s;ee her pale and patient gho&s;t ri&s;ing to reproach you? Can you recollect her virtues, her innocence, her &s;potle&s;s manners, her unre&s;enting temper, and not run di&s;tracted with remor&s;e? Have you not killed her in the fir&s;t bloom of her youth? Can you bear to think that &s;he now lies mouldering in the grave through your cur&s;ed contrivance, that de&s;erved a crown, ten thou&s;and times more than you de&s;erve to live? And do you expect that mankind will ever forget, or forgive &s;uch a deed? Go, mi&s;erable wretch; think your&s;elf too happy that you are permitted to fly the face of man! Why, what a pitiful figure do you make at this moment! Do you think that any thing could bring &s;o hardened a wretch as you are, to &s;hrink from reproach, if your con&s;cience were not in confederacy with him that reproached you? And were you fool enough to believe that any ob&s;tinacy however determined could enable you to de&s;pi&s;e the keen rebuke of ju&s;tice? Go, go, &s;hrink into your mi&s;erable &s;elf! Begone, and let me never be bla&s;ted with your fight again!</P>
<P>And here, however incredible it may appear, Mr. Tyrrel began to obey his imperious cen&s;urer. His looks were full of wildne&s;s and horror; his limbs trembled; and his tongue refu&s;ed its office. He felt no power of re&s;i&s;ting the impetuous tor|rent of reproach that was poured upon him. He he&s;itated; he was a&s;hamed of his own defeat; he &s;eemed to wi&s;h to deny it. But his &s;truggles were ineffectual; every attempt peri&s;hed in the moment
<PB N="132" REF="028752_0134_0FDBF05C685EA7E0">
it was made. The general voice was eager to aba&s;h him. As his confu&s;ion became more vi&s;ible, the outcry increa&s;ed. It &s;welled gradually to hoot|ings, tumult, and a deafening noi&s;e of indigna|tion. At length he willingly retired from the public &s;cene, unable any longer to endure the &s;en|&s;ations it inflicted.</P>
<P>In about an hour and a half he returned. No precaution had been taken again&s;t this incident, for nothing could be more unexpected. In the in|terval he had intoxicated him&s;elf with large draughts of brandy. In a moment he was in a part of the room where Mr. Falkland was &s;tanding, and with one blow of his mu&s;cular arm levelled him with the earth. The blow however was not &s;tunning, and Mr. Falkland ro&s;e again immediately. It is obvious to perceive how unequal he mu&s;t have been to this &s;pecies of conte&s;t. He was &s;carcely ri&s;en, before Mr. Tyrrel repeated his blow. Mr. Falkland was now upon his guard, and did not fall. But the blows of his adver&s;ary were redou|bled with a rapidity difficult to conceive, and Mr. Falkland was once again brought to the earth. In this &s;ituation Mr. Tyrrel kicked his pro&s;trate enemy, and &s;tooped, apparently with the intention of drag|ging him along the floor. All this pa&s;&s;ed in a mo|ment, and the gentlemen pre&s;ent had not time to recover their &s;urpri&s;e. They now interfered, and Mr. Tyrrel once more quitted the apartment.</P>
<P>It is difficult to conceive of any event more ter|rible to the individual upon whom it fell, than the treatment which Mr. Falkland in this in&s;tance ex|perienced. Every pa&s;&s;ion of his life was calculated to make him feel it more acutely He had repeated|ly exerted the mo&s;t uncommon energy and pru|dence to prevent the mi&s;under&s;tanding between Mr. Tyrrel and him&s;elf from proceeding to extre|mities; but in vain! It was clo&s;ed with a cata|&s;trophe
<PB N="133" REF="028752_0135_0FDBF0A241BAA080">
exceeding all that he had feared, or that the mo&s;t penetrating fore&s;ight could have &s;ugge&s;ted. To Mr. Falkland di&s;grace was wor&s;e than death. The &s;lighte&s;t breath of di&s;honour would have &s;tung him to the very &s;oul. What mu&s;t it have been with this complication of ignominy, ba&s;e, humiliating and public? Could Mr. Tyrrel have under&s;tood the evil he inflicted, even he under all his circum|&s;tances of provocation could hardly have perpe|trated it. Mr. Falkland's mind mu&s;t have been full of uproar like the war of contending elements, and of &s;uch &s;uffering as ca&s;ts contempt on the re|finements of inventive cruelty. He wi&s;hed no doubt for annihilation, to lie down in eternal obli|vion, in an in&s;en&s;ibility, which compared with what he experienced was &s;carcely le&s;s enviable than beatitude it&s;elf. Horror, dete&s;tation, revenge, in|expre&s;&s;ible longings to &s;hake off the evil, and a per|&s;ua&s;ion that in this ca&s;e all effort was powerle&s;s, mu&s;t have filled his &s;oul even to bur&s;ting.</P>
<P>One other event clo&s;ed the tran&s;actions of this memorable evening. Mr. Falkland was baffled of the vengeance that yet remained to him. Mr. Tyrrel was found by &s;ome of the company dead in the &s;treet, having been murdered at the di&s;tance of a few yards from the a&s;&s;embly hou&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL endeavour to &s;tate the remainder of this narrative in the words of Mr. Collins. The reader has already had occa&s;ion to perceive that Mr. Collins was a man of no vulgar order; and his reflections on this &s;ubject were uncommonly judi|cious.</P>
<P>"This day was the cri&s;is of Mr. Falkland's hi&s;|tory. From hence took its beginning that gloomy and un&s;ociable melancholy of which he has &s;ince been the victim. No two characters can be in cer|tain re&s;pects more &s;trongly contra&s;ted, than the Mr. Falkland of a date prior and &s;ub&s;equent to the&s;e events. Hitherto he had been attended by a fortune perpetually pro&s;perous. His mind was &s;anguine; full of that undoubting confidence in its own powers which pro&s;perity is qualified to pro|duce. Though the habits of his life were tho&s;e of a &s;erious and &s;ublime vi&s;ionary, they were never|thele&s;s full of chearfulne&s;s and tranquillity. But from this moment his pride and the lofty adven|turou&s;ne&s;s of his &s;pirit were effectually &s;ubdued. From an object of envy he was changed into an object of compa&s;&s;ion. Life, which hitherto no one had &s;o exqui&s;itely enjoyed, became a burthen to him. No more &s;elf-complacency, no more rapture, no more &s;elf-approving and heart-tran&s;porting be|nevolence! He, who had lived beyond any man upon the grand and animating reveries of the ima|gination, &s;eemed now to have no vi&s;ions but of an|gui&s;h and de&s;pair. His ca&s;e was peculiarly worthy of &s;ympathy, &s;ince no doubt, if rectitude and pu|rity
<PB N="135" REF="028752_0137_0FDBF0A39660A728">
of di&s;po&s;ition could give a title to happine&s;s, few men could exhibit a more con&s;i&s;tent and pow|erful claim than Mr. Falkland.</P>
<P>"He was too deeply pervaded with the idle and groundle&s;s romances of chivalry ever to forget the &s;ituation, humiliating and di&s;honourable according to his ideas, in which he had been placed upon this occa&s;ion. There is a my&s;terious &s;ort of divi|nity annexed to the per&s;on of a true knight, that makes any &s;pecies of brute violence committed upon it indelible and immortal. To be knocked down, cuffed, kicked, dragged along the floor! &s;acred heaven, the memory of &s;uch a treatment was intolerable! No future lu&s;tration could ever remove the &s;tain: and, what was perhaps &s;till wor&s;e in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the offender having cea&s;|ed to exi&s;t, the lu&s;tration which the laws of knight-errantry pre&s;cribe was rendered impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>"In &s;ome future period of human improvement it is probable that that calamity will be in a man|ner unintelligible, which in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance contributed to tarni&s;h and wither the excellence of one of the mo&s;t elevated and amiable of human minds. If Mr. Falkland had reflected with per|fect accuracy upon the ca&s;e, he would probably have been able to look down with indifference upon a wound which, as it was, pierced to his very vitals. How much more dignity than in the modern duel|li&s;t do we find in Themi&s;tocles, the mo&s;t gallant of the Greeks; who, when Eurybiades, his comman|der in chief, in an&s;wer to &s;ome of his remon&s;tran|ces, lifted his cane over him with a menacing air, acco&s;ted him in that noble apo&s;trophe, Strike, but hear?</P>
<P>"How would a man of true di&s;cernment in &s;uch a ca&s;e reply to his brutal a&s;&s;ailant? <Q>I make it my boa&s;t that I can endure calamity and pain: &s;hall I not be able to endure the trifling incon|venience

that your folly can inflict upon me? Perhaps a human being would be more accom|pli&s;hed, if he under&s;tood the &s;cience of per&s;on|al defence; but how few would be the occa|&s;ions upon which he would be called to exert it? How few human beings would he encoun|ter &s;o unju&s;t and injurious as you, if his own conduct were directed by the principles of rea|&s;on and benevolence? Be&s;ide, how narrow would be the u&s;e of this &s;cience, when acquired? It will &s;carcely put the man of delicate make and petty &s;tature upon a level with the athletic pugili&s;t; and, if it did in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ecure me again&s;t the malice of a &s;ingle adver&s;ary, &s;till my per&s;on and my life, &s;o far as mere force is concerned, would&punc; always be at the mercy of two. Farther than immediate defence again&s;t actual violence it could never be of u&s;e to me. The man who can deliberately meet his adver|&s;ary for the purpo&s;e of expo&s;ing the per&s;ons of one or both of them to injury, tramples upon every principle of rea&s;on and equity.

"The&s;e rea&s;onings, however &s;imple and irre|&s;i&s;tible they mu&s;t be found by a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate en|quirer, are little reflected on by the world at large, and were mo&s;t of all uncongenial to the prejudices of Mr. Falkland. But the public di&s;grace and cha&s;|ti&s;ement that had been impo&s;ed upon him, intole|rable as they were to be recollected, were not the whole of the mi&s;chief that redounded to our un|fortunate patron from the tran&s;actions of that day. It was pre&s;ently whi&s;pered that he was no other than the murderer of his antagoni&s;t. This rumour was of too much importance to the very continu|ance of his life, to ju&s;tify its being concealed from him. He heard it with inexpre&s;&s;ible a&s;toni&s;hment and horror; it formed a dreadful addition to the load of intellectual angui&s;h that already oppre&s;&s;ed him. No man had ever held his reputation &s;o dear to him as Mr. Falkland; and now in one day he was fallen under the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite calamities, a complicated per&s;onal in&s;ult, and the imputation of the foule&s;t of crimes. He might have fled; for no one was forward to proceed again&s;t a man &s;o a|dored as Mr. Falkland, or in revenge of one &s;o univer&s;ally execrated as Mr. Tyrrel. But flight he di&s;dained. In the mean time the affair was of too &s;erious a magnitude, the rumour unchecked &s;eem|ed daily to increa&s;e in &s;trength, and the magi&s;trates were at length obliged to take &s;ome &s;teps upon the &s;ubject. Without cau&s;ing him to be apprehended, they &s;ent to de&s;ire he would appear before them at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their meetings. They inve&s;tigated the par|ticulars of the &s;tory. What could they do?

as &s;oon as he arrived at it, and, when they enquired for him of the waiters, they were given to under&s;tand that he had mounted his hor&s;e and rode home. In con&s;ideration of the&s;e particulars the magi&s;trates concluded that they could not be ju&s;tified but in committing Mr. Falkland to pri&s;on. His defence was manly, logical, and impre&s;&s;ive. But, though they entertained the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;ump|tion of his innocence, they conceived that they were obliged in their capacity to proceed upon the unfortunate circum&s;tances that appeared again&s;t the accu&s;ed, and commit him for his deliverance to a trial by his country. In all this Mr. Falkland was nearly pa&s;&s;ive. He &s;eemed to fear by too direct an appeal to judicature to render more preci&s;e an im|putation the memory of which he deprecated, at the &s;ame time that he was &s;ufficiently willing to meet the &s;evere&s;t &s;crutiny, and, if he could not hope to have it forgotten that he had ever been ac|cu&s;ed, to prove in the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory manner that the accu&s;ation was unju&s;t.</P>
<P>"Never in this quarter of the i&s;land was a court more crowded with per&s;ons of the highe&s;t di&s;tinc|tion than upon Mr. Falkland's trial. Never was expectation wrought to a higher pitch, or the pa&s;|&s;ions of men more profoundly intere&s;ted. You &s;eem never to have heard of this memorable tran&s;|action; and indeed that is little to be wondered at, &s;ince the good nature of the world is intere&s;ted in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it, and it is deemed a di&s;grace to a man to have held up his hand at a criminal bar, though acquitted with circum&s;tances the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory and honourable. It may be &s;uppo&s;ed that this &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion is particularly acceptable to Mr. Falkland; and I &s;hould not have acted in contradiction to his modes of thinking in communicating the &s;tory to you, had there not been circum&s;tances of peculiar urgency that &s;eemed to render the communication de&s;irable.</P>

"The facts adduced upon the trial were preci&s;e|ly tho&s;e which had already been laid before the magi&s;trates.

<P>"My lord, and gentlemen of the jury,</P>
<P>"I &s;tand here accu&s;ed of a crime the mo&s;t black that any human creature is capable of perpetrating. I am innocent. I have no fear that I &s;hall fail to make every per&s;on in this court acknowledge my innocence. In the mean time what mu&s;t be my feelings? Con&s;cious as I am of de&s;erving approba|tion and not cen&s;ure, of having pa&s;&s;ed my life in acts of ju&s;tice and philanthropy, can any thing be more deplorable than for me to &s;tand here to an|&s;wer a charge of murder? So wretched is my &s;itua|tion, that I cannot accept your gratuitous acquit|tal, if you &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to be&s;tow it. I mu&s;t an&s;wer to an imputation, the very thought of which is ten thou&s;and times wor&s;e than death. I mu&s;t exert the whole energy of my mind to prevent my being ranked with the vile&s;t of men.</P>
<P>"Gentlemen, this is a &s;ituation in which a man may be allowed to boa&s;t. Accur&s;ed &s;ituation! No man need envy me the vile and polluted triumph I am now to gain! I have called no witne&s;&s;es to my character. Great God! what &s;ort of a character is that which mu&s;t be &s;upported by witne&s;&s;es? But, if I mu&s;t &s;peak, look round the court, a&s;k of every one pre&s;ent, enquire of your own hearts!
<PB N="140" REF="028752_0142_0FDBF06552F0EC38">
Not one word of reproach was ever whi&s;pered again&s;t my character. I do not he&s;itate to call upon tho&s;e who have known me mo&s;t to afford me the mo&s;t honourable te&s;timony.</P>
<P>"My life has been &s;pent in the keene&s;t and mo&s;t unintermitted &s;en&s;ibility to reputation. I am almo&s;t indifferent as to what &s;hall be the event of this day. I would not open my mouth upon the occa&s;ion, if my life were the only thing that was at &s;take. It is not in the power of your verdict to re&s;tore to me my unblemi&s;hed reputation, to obli|terate the di&s;grace I have &s;uffered, or to prevent it from being remembered that I have been brought to trial upon a charge of murder. Your verdict can never have the efficacy to prevent the mi&s;erable remains of my exi&s;tence from being the mo&s;t in|tolerable of all burthens.</P>
<P>"I am accu&s;ed of having committed murder upon the body of Barnabas Tyrrel. I would mo&s;t joyfully have given every farthing I po&s;&s;e&s;s, and devoted my&s;elf to perpetual beggary, to have pre|&s;erved his life. His life was precious to me, be|yond that of all mankind. In my opinion the greate&s;t inju&s;tice committed by his unknown a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in was that of defrauding me of my ju&s;t revenge. I confe&s;s that I would have called him out to the field, and that our encounter &s;hould not have been terminated but by the death of one or both of us. This would have been a pitiful and inadequate compen&s;ation for his unparalleled in&s;ult, but it was all that remained.</P>
<P>"I a&s;k for no pity, but I mu&s;t openly declare that never was any misfortune &s;o horrible as mine. I would willingly have taken refuge from the re|collection of that night in a voluntary death. Life was now &s;tripped of all tho&s;e recommendations for the &s;ake of which it was dear to me. But even this con&s;olation is denied me. I am com|pelled
<PB N="141" REF="028752_0143_0FDBF0AB1EE03C60">
to drag for ever the intolerable load of ex|i&s;tence, upon penalty, if at any period however remote I &s;hake it off, of having that impatience regarded as confirming a charge of murder. Gen|tlemen, if by your verdict you could take away my life, without that act being connected with my di&s;grace, I would ble&s;s the cord that &s;u&s;pended the breath of my exi&s;tence for ever.</P>
<P>"You all know how ea&s;ily I might have fled from this purgation. If I had been guilty, &s;hould I not have embraced the opportunity? But, as it was, I could not. Reputation has been the idol, the jewel of my life. I could never have borne to think that a human creature in the remote&s;t part of the globe &s;hould believe that I was a criminal. Alas! what a deity it is that I have cho&s;en for my wor&s;hip! I have entailed upon my&s;elf everla&s;ting agony and de&s;pair!</P>
<P>"I have but one word to add. Gentlemen, I charge you to do me the imperfect ju&s;tice that your office puts in your power! My life is a worthle&s;s thing. But my honour, the paltry remains of honour I have now to boa&s;t, is in your judgment. It is little that you can do for me; but it is not le&s;s your duty to do that little. May that God who is the fountain of honour and good, pro&s;per and protect you! The man who now &s;tands before you is devoted to perpetual barrenne&s;s and bla&s;t! He has nothing to hope for beyond the feeble con|&s;olation of this day!"</P>
<P>"You will ea&s;ily imagine that Mr. Falkland was acquitted with every circum&s;tance of honour. Nothing is more to be deplored in human in&s;titu|tions than that the forms of ju&s;tice &s;hould thus &s;ubject a man, of who&s;e innocence every one was convinced, to a &s;pecies of purgation to which the ideas of mankind have annexed a &s;entiment of di&s;|grace. Nobody entertained the &s;hadow of a doubt
<PB N="142" REF="028752_0144_0FDBF069DBBDAB58">
upon the &s;ubject, and yet a mere incidental con|currence of circum&s;tances made it nece&s;&s;ary that the be&s;t of men &s;hould be publicly arraigned as if really under &s;u&s;picion of an atrocious crime. It may be granted indeed that Mr. Falkland had his faults, but tho&s;e very faults placed him at a &s;till farther di&s;tance from the criminality in que&s;tion. He was the fool of honour and fame; a man whom in the pur&s;uit of reputation nothing could divert; who would have purcha&s;ed the character of a true, gallant and undaunted hero at the expence of worlds, and who thought every calamity nominal but a &s;tain upon his honour. How atrociou&s;ly ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e any motive capable of inducing &s;uch a man to play the part of a lurking a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in? How unfeeling to oblige him to defend him&s;elf from &s;uch an imputation in a court of ju&s;tice? Did any man, and lea&s;t of all a man of the pure&s;t honour, ever pa&s;s in a moment from a life un&s;tain|ed by a &s;ingle act of injury to the con&s;ummation of human depravity?</P>
<P>"When the verdict of the jury was given, a general murmur of applau&s;e and involuntary tran&s;|port bur&s;t forth in the court. It was at fir&s;t low, and gradually became louder. As it was the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of rapturous delight and an emotion di&s;in|tere&s;ted and divine, &s;o there was an inde&s;cribable &s;omething in the very &s;ound that carried it home to the heart, and convinced every &s;pectator that no per&s;onal plea&s;ure ever exi&s;ted that was not fool|i&s;h and feeble in the compari&s;on. Every one &s;trove who &s;hould mo&s;t expre&s;s his e&s;teem of the amiable accu&s;ed. Mr. Falkland was no &s;ooner withdrawn, than the gentlemen in the court crowded together to con&s;ult how they &s;hould mo&s;t effectually expre&s;s their congratulation. They immediately named a deputation to wait upon him for that purpo&s;e. The grand jury and the petty jury drew up an ad|dre&s;s
<PB N="143" REF="028752_0145_0FDBF0B163D22698">
of a &s;imilar nature. The very judges and coun&s;el, though le&s;s acquainted with his per&s;onal character, were &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the mute and univer&s;al te&s;timony they witne&s;&s;ed in his fa|vour, and zealou&s;ly concurred to a&s;&s;i&s;t the general &s;entiment. It was a &s;ort of &s;ympathetic feeling that took hold upon all ranks and degrees. The multitude received him with huzzas, they took his hor&s;es from his carriage, dragged him in triumph, and attended him many miles in his return to his own habitation. It &s;eemed as if a public trial be|fore a criminal judge, which had hitherto been con&s;idered in every event as a brand of di&s;grace, was converted in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance into an occa|&s;ion of enthu&s;ia&s;tic adoration and unexampled honour.</P>
<P>"But nothing could reach the heart of Mr. Falkland. He was not in&s;en&s;ible to the general kindne&s;s and exertions; but it was too evident that the melancholy that had taken hold of his mind was invincible.</P>
<P>"It was only a few weeks after this memorable trial that the real murderer was di&s;covered. Every part of this &s;tory was extraordinary. The real murderer was Hawkins. He was found with his &s;on under a feigned name at a village at about thirty miles di&s;tance, in want of all the nece&s;&s;aries of life. He had lived here from the period of his flight in &s;o private a manner, that all the enqui|ries that had been &s;et on foot by the benevolence of Mr. Falkland or the in&s;atiable malice of Mr. Tyrrel had been in&s;ufficient to di&s;cover him. The fir&s;t thing that had led to the detection was a parcel of clothes covered with blood that were found in a ditch, and which, when drawn out, were known by the people of the village to belong to this man. The murder of Mr. Tyrrel was not a circum&s;tance that could be unknown, and &s;u&s;|picion
<PB N="144" REF="028752_0146_0FDBF06C128DEC78">
was immediately rou&s;ed. A diligent &s;earch being made, the ru&s;ty handle with part of the blade of a knife was &s;ound thrown in a corner of his lodging, which being applied to a piece of the point of a knife that had been broken in the wound, appeared exactly to corre&s;pond. Upon farther enquiry two ru&s;tics, who had been acci|dentally on the &s;pot, remembered to have &s;een Hawkins and his &s;on in the town that very even|ing, and to have called after them, and received no an&s;wer, though they were &s;ure of their per&s;ons. Upon this accumulated evidence both Hawkins and his &s;on were tried, condemned and afterwards executed. In the interval between the &s;entence and execution Hawkins confe&s;&s;ed his guilt with many marks of compunction; though there are per&s;ons by whom this is denied; but I have taken &s;ome pains to enquire into the fact, and am per|&s;uaded that their di&s;belief is precipitate and ground|le&s;s.</P>
<P>"The cruel inju&s;tice that this man had &s;uffered from his village tyrant was not forgotten upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. It was by a &s;trange fatality that the barbarous proceedings of Mr. Tyrrel &s;eemed never to fall &s;hort of their completion; and even his death &s;erved eventually to con&s;ummate the ruin of a man he hated, a circum&s;tance, which, if it could have come to his knowledge, would perhaps have in &s;ome mea&s;ure con&s;oled him for his un|timely end. This poor Hawkins was &s;urely en|titled to &s;ome pity, &s;ince his being finally urged to de&s;peration, and brought, together with his &s;on, to an ignominious fate, was originally owing to the &s;turdine&s;s of his virtue and independence. But the compa&s;&s;ion of the public was in a great mea&s;ure &s;hut again&s;t him, as they thought it a piece of barbarous and unpardonable &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, that he had not rather come boldly forward to
<PB N="145" REF="028752_0147_0FDBF0B29851F3C0">
meet the con&s;equences of his own conduct, than &s;uffer a man of &s;o much public worth as Mr. Falk|land, and who had been &s;o de&s;irous of doing him good, to be tried for a murder that he had com|mitted.</P>
<P>"From this time to the pre&s;ent Mr. Falkland has been nearly &s;uch as you at pre&s;ent &s;ee him. Though it be &s;everal years &s;ince the&s;e tran&s;actions, the impre&s;&s;ion they made is for ever fre&s;h in the mind of our unfortunate patron. From thence|forward his habits became totally different. He had before been fond of public &s;cenes, and acting a part in the mid&s;t of the people among whom he immediately re&s;ided. He now made him&s;elf a rigid reclu&s;e. He had no a&s;&s;ociates, no friends. Incon&s;olable him&s;elf, he yet wi&s;hed to treat others with kindne&s;s. There was a &s;olemn &s;adne&s;s in his manner, attended with the mo&s;t perfect gentlene&s;s and humanity. Every body re&s;pects him, for his benevolence is unalterable; but there is a &s;tately coldne&s;s and re&s;erve in his behaviour, which makes it difficult for tho&s;e about him to regard him with the familiarity of affection. The&s;e &s;ymptoms are uninterrupted, except at certain times when his &s;ufferings become intolerable, and he di&s;plays the marks of a furious in&s;anity. At tho&s;e times his language is fearful and my&s;terious, and he &s;eems to figure to him&s;elf by turns every &s;ort of per&s;e|cution and alarm which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to attend upon an accu&s;ation of murder. But, &s;en&s;ible of his own weakne&s;s, he is anxious at &s;uch times to withdraw into &s;olitude; and his dome&s;tics in ge|neral know nothing of him but the uncommunica|tive and haughty, yet mild dejection that accom|panies every thing he does."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE &s;tated the narrative of Mr. Collins, in|ter&s;per&s;ed with &s;uch other information as I was able to collect, with all the exactne&s;s that my me|mory, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by certain memorandums I made at the time, will afford. I do not pretend to warrant the authenticity of any part of the&s;e memoirs ex|cept &s;o much as fell under my own knowledge, and that part &s;hall be &s;tated with the &s;ame &s;implicity and accuracy that I would ob&s;erve towards a court which was to decide in the la&s;t re&s;ort upon every thing dear to me. The &s;ame &s;crupulous fidelity re&s;trains me from altering the manner of Mr. Col|lins's narrative to adapt it to the precepts of my own ta&s;te; and it will &s;oon be perceived how e&s;&s;ential that narrative is to the elucidation of my own hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The intention of my friend in this communica|tion was to give me ea&s;e; but he in reality added to my embarra&s;&s;ment. Hitherto I had had no in|tercour&s;e with the world and its pa&s;&s;ions; and, though I was not totally unacquainted with them as they appear in books, this proved to be of little &s;ervice to me when I came to witne&s;s them my&s;elf. The ca&s;e &s;eemed entirely altered, when the &s;ubject of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions was continually before my eyes, and the events had happened but the other day as it were, in the very neighbourhood where I lived. There was a connection and progre&s;s in this nar|rative, which made it altogether unlike the little village incidents I had hitherto known. My feel|ings
<PB N="147" REF="028752_0149_0FDBF0FA933BF340">
were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively intere&s;ted for the different per&s;ons that were brought upon the &s;cene. My veneration was excited for Mr. Clare, and my ap|plau&s;e for the intrepidity of Mrs. Hammond. I was a&s;toni&s;hed that any human creature &s;hould be &s;o &s;hockingly perverted as Mr. Tyrrel. I paid the tribute of my tears to the memory of the artle&s;s Mi&s;s Melvile. I found a thou&s;and fre&s;h rea&s;ons to admire and love my ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t I was &s;atisfied with thus con&s;idering every incident in its obvious &s;en&s;e. But the &s;tory I had heard was for ever in my thoughts, and I was peculiarly intere&s;ted to comprehend its full im|port. I turned it a thou&s;and ways, and examined it in every point of view. In the original commu|nication it appeared &s;ufficiently di&s;tinct and &s;atis|factory; but, as I brooded over it, it gradually be|came my&s;terious. There was &s;omething &s;trange in the character of Hawkins. So firm, &s;o &s;turdily hone&s;t and ju&s;t, as he appeared at fir&s;t; all at once to become a murderer! His fir&s;t behaviour under the pro&s;ecution, how accurately was it calculated to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s one in his favor! To be &s;ure, if he were guilty, it was very cruel of him to &s;uffer a man of &s;o much worth as Mr. Falkland to be tried for his crime! And yet I could not help bitterly com|pa&s;&s;ionating the hone&s;t fellow, brought to the gal|lows, as he was, &s;trictly &s;peaking, by the machi|nations of that devil incarnate, Mr. Tyrrel. His &s;on too, that &s;on for whom he voluntarily &s;acrificed his all, to die with him at the &s;ame tree; &s;urely never was a &s;tory more affecting!</P>
<P>Was it po&s;&s;ible after all that Mr. Falkland &s;hould be the murderer? The reader will &s;carcely believe that the idea &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf to my mind, that I would a&s;k him. It was but a pa&s;&s;ing thought; but it &s;erves to mark the &s;implicity of my charac|ter. Then I recollected the virtues of my ma&s;ter,
<PB N="148" REF="028752_0150_0FDBF0BAFAAB8800">
almo&s;t too &s;ublime for human nature; I thought of his &s;ufferings &s;o unexampled, &s;o unmerited; and chid my&s;elf for the &s;u&s;picion. The dying confe&s;&s;ion of Hawkins recurred to my mind; and I felt that there was no longer a po&s;&s;ibility of doubting. And yet what was the meaning of all Mr. Falkland's agonies and terrors? In fine, the idea having once occurred to my mind, it was fixed there for ever. My thoughts fluctuated from conjecture to conjecture, but this was the centre about which they revolved. I determined to place my&s;elf as a watch upon my ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The in&s;tant I had cho&s;en this employment for my&s;elf, I found a &s;trange &s;ort of plea&s;ure in it. To do what is forbidden always has its charms, becau&s;e we have an indi&s;tinct apprehen&s;ion of &s;omething arbitrary and tyrannical in the prohibi|tion. To be a &s;py upon Mr. Falkland! That there was danger in the employment &s;erved to give an alluring pungency to the choice. I remembered the &s;tern reprimand I had received, his terrible looks; and the recollection gave a kind of tingling &s;en&s;ation, not altogether unallied to enjoyment. The farther I advanced, the more the &s;en&s;ation was irre&s;i&s;tible. I &s;eemed to my&s;elf perpetually upon the brink of being countermined, and perpetually rou&s;ed to guard my de&s;igns. The more impene|trable Mr. Falkland was determined to be, the more uncontroulable was my curio&s;ity. Through the whole my alarm and apprehen&s;ion of per&s;onal danger, had a large mixture of frankne&s;s and &s;im|plicity, con&s;cious of meaning no ill, that made me continually ready to &s;ay every thing that was upon my mind, and would not &s;uffer me to believe that, when things were brought to the te&s;t, any one could be &s;eriou&s;ly angry with me.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections led gradually to a new &s;tate of my mind. When I had fir&s;t removed into Mr.
<PB N="149" REF="028752_0151_0FDBF0FCE3DEC8F8">
Falkland's family, the novelty of the &s;cene render|ed me cautious and re&s;erved. The di&s;tant and &s;o|lemn manners of my ma&s;ter &s;eemed to have anni|hilated my con&s;titutional gaiety. But the novelty by degrees wore off, and my con&s;traint in the &s;ame degree dimini&s;hed. The &s;tory I had now heard, and the curio&s;ity it excited, re&s;tored to me acti|vity, eagerne&s;s and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ourage. I had always had a propen&s;ity to communicate my thoughts; my age was naturally inclined to talkativene&s;s; and I ven|tured occa&s;ionally in a &s;ort of he&s;itating way, as if que&s;tioning whether &s;uch a conduct might be al|lowed to expre&s;s my &s;entiments as they aro&s;e, in the pre&s;ence of Mr. Falkland.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time I did &s;o, he looked at me with an air of &s;urpri&s;e, made me no an&s;wer, and pre&s;ently took occa&s;ion to leave me. The experiment was &s;oon after repeated. My ma&s;ter &s;eemed half in|clined to encourage me, and yet doubtful whether he might venture. He had been long a &s;tranger to plea&s;ure of every &s;ort, and my artle&s;s and untaught remarks appeared to promi&s;e him &s;ome amu&s;ement. In this uncertainty he could not probably find it in his heart to treat with &s;everity my innocent ef|fu&s;ions. I needed but little encouragement: for the perturbation of my mind &s;tood in want of this relief. My &s;implicity, ari&s;ing from my being a total &s;tranger to the intercour&s;e of the world, was accompanied with a mind in &s;ome degree cultivated with reading, and perhaps not altogether de&s;titute of ob&s;ervation and talent. My remarks were there|fore perpetually unexpected, at one time implying extreme ignorance, and at another &s;ome portion of acutene&s;s, but at all times having an air of in|nocence, frankne&s;s and courage. There was &s;till an apparent want of de&s;ign in the manner, even after I was excited accurately to compare my ob&s;er|vations and &s;tudy the inferences to which they led;
<PB N="150" REF="028752_0152_0FDBF0BC5BA550F8">
for the effect of old habit was more vi&s;ible, than that of a recently-conceived purpo&s;e which was hardly yet mature. Mr. Falkland's &s;ituation was like that of a fi&s;h that plays with the bait employed to entrap him. By my manner he was in a certain degree encouraged to lay a&s;ide his u&s;ual re&s;erve and relax his &s;tateline&s;s; till &s;ome abrupt ob&s;ervation or interrogatory &s;tung him into recollection and brought back his alarm. Still it was evident that he bore about him a &s;ecret wound. Whenever the cau&s;e of his &s;orrows was touched, though in a manner the mo&s;t indirect and remote, his coun|tenance altered, his di&s;temper returned, and it was with difficulty that he could &s;uppre&s;s his emotions, &s;ometimes conquering him&s;elf with painful effort, and &s;ometimes bur&s;ting into a &s;ort of paroxi&s;m of in&s;anity, and ha&s;tening to bury him&s;elf in &s;olitude. The&s;e appearances I too frequently interpreted into grounds of &s;u&s;picion, though I might with equal probability and more liberality have a&s;cribed them to the cruel mortifications he had encountered in the objects of his darling ambition. Mr. Collins had &s;trongly urged me to &s;ecrecy; and Mr. Falk|land, whenever my ge&s;ture or his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s impre&s;&s;ed him with the idea of my knowing more than I expre&s;&s;ed, looked at me with wi&s;tful earne&s;t|ne&s;s, as que&s;tioning what was the degree of infor|mation I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and how it was obtained. But again at our next interview the &s;imple vivacity of my manner re&s;tored his tranquillity, obliterated the emotion of which I had been the cau&s;e, and placed things afre&s;h in their former &s;ituation. The longer this humble familiarity on my part had continued, the more effort it would require to &s;uppre&s;s it; and Mr. Falkland was neither willing to mortify me by a &s;evere prohibition of &s;peech, nor even perhaps to make me of &s;o much con&s;equence as that prohibition might &s;eem to imply. Though I
<PB N="151" REF="028752_0153_0FDBF1012B07EE20">
was curious, it mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed that I had the object of my enquiry for ever in my mind, or that my que&s;tions and innuendos were perpetually re|gulated with the cunning of a grey-headed inqui|&s;itor. The &s;ecret wound of Mr. Falkland's mind was much more uniformly pre&s;ent to his recol|lection than to mine; and a thou&s;and times he applied the remarks that occurred in conver&s;ation, when I had not the remote&s;t idea of &s;uch an ap|plication till &s;ome &s;ingularity in his manner brought it back to my thoughts. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this morbid &s;en&s;ibility, and the imagination that its in|fluence might perhaps con&s;titute the whole of the ca&s;e, &s;erved probably to &s;pur Mr. Falkland again to the charge, and connect a &s;entiment of &s;hame with every project that &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf for interrupting the freedom of our intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>I will give a &s;pecimen of the conver&s;ations to which I allude, and as it &s;hall be &s;elected from tho&s;e which began upon topics the mo&s;t general and remote, the reader will ea&s;ily imagine the di&s;|turbance that was almo&s;t daily endured by a mind &s;o tremblingly alive as that of my ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Pray, &s;ir, &s;aid I, one day as I was a&s;&s;i&s;ting Mr. Falkland in arranging &s;ome papers previou&s;ly to their being tran&s;cribed into his collection, how came Alexander of Macedon to be &s;urnamed the Great?</P>
<P>How came it? Did you never read his hi&s;|tory?</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ir.</P>
<P>Well, Williams, and could you find no rea&s;ons there?</P>
<P>Why, I do not know, &s;ir. I could find rea&s;ons why he &s;hould be famous; but every man that is talked of, is not admired. Judges differ about the merits of Alexander. Doctor Prideaux &s;ays in his Connections that he de&s;erves only to be called the

Great Cut-throat, and the author of Tom Jones has written a volume to prove that he and all other conquerors ought to be cla&s;&s;ed with Jonathan Wild.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland involuntarily reddened at the&s;e citations.</P>
<P>Accur&s;ed bla&s;phemy! Did the&s;e authors think that by the coar&s;ene&s;s of their ribaldry they could de&s;troy his well-earned fame? Are learning, &s;en&s;i|bility and ta&s;te no &s;ecurities to exempt their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or from this vulgar abu&s;e? Did you ever read, Williams, of a man more gallant, generous and free? Was ever mortal &s;o completely the rever&s;e of every thing engro&s;&s;ing and &s;elfi&s;h? He formed to him&s;elf a &s;ublime image of excellence, and his only ambition was to reali&s;e it in his own &s;tory. Remember his giving away every thing when he &s;et out upon his grand expedition, profe&s;&s;edly re|&s;erving for him&s;elf nothing but hope. Recollect his heroic confidence in Philip, the phy&s;ician, and his entire and unalterable friend&s;hip for Ephe&s;tion. He treated the captive family of Darius with the mo&s;t cordial urbanity, and the venerable Sy&s;igambis with all the tenderne&s;s and attention of a &s;on to his mother. Never take the judgment, Williams, upon &s;uch a &s;ubject of a clerical pedant or a We&s;t|min&s;ter ju&s;tice. Examine for your&s;elf, and you will find in Alexander a model of honour, gene|ro&s;ity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, a man who for the cultivated liberality of his mind and the unparallel|ed grandeur of his projects mu&s;t &s;tand alone the &s;pectacle and admiration of all ages of the world.</P>
<P>Ah, &s;ir! it is a very fine thing for us to &s;it here and compo&s;e his panegyric. But would you have me forget what a va&s;t expence was be&s;towed in erecting the monument of his fame? Was not he the common di&s;turber of mankind? Did nor he overrun nations that would never have heard of him, but for his deva&s;tations? How many hun|dred
<PB N="153" REF="028752_0155_0FDBF10216F85730">
thou&s;ands of lives did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">acrifice in his ca|reer? What mu&s;t I think of his cruelties; a whole tribe ma&s;&s;acred for a crime committed by their an|ce&s;tors one hundred and fifty years before; fifty thou&s;and &s;old into &s;lavery; two thou&s;and crucified for their gallant defence of their country? Man is &s;urely a &s;trange &s;ort of creature, who never prai&s;es any one more heartily than him who has &s;pread de&s;truction and ruin over the face of nations!</P>
<P>The way of thinking you expre&s;s, Williams, is natural enough, and I cannot blame you for it. But let me hope that you will become more liberal. The death of a hundred thou&s;and men is at fir&s;t fight very &s;hocking; but what in reality are a hun|dred thou&s;and &s;uch men more than a hundred thou|&s;and &s;heep? It is mind, Williams, the generation of knowledge and virtue that we ought to love. This was the project of Alexander; he &s;et out in a great undertaking to civili&s;e mankind; he de|livered the va&s;t continent of A&s;ia from the &s;tupidity and degradation of the Per&s;ian monarchy; and, though he was cut off in the mid&s;t of his career, we may ea&s;ily perceive the va&s;t effects of his pro|ject. Grecian literature and cultivation, the Seleucidae, the Antiochu&s;es and the Prolomies fol|lowed, in nations which before had been &s;unk to the condition of brutes. Alexander was the builder as notoriou&s;ly as the de&s;troyer of cities.</P>
<P>And yet, &s;ir, I am afraid that the pike and the battle-axe are not the right in&s;truments for making men wi&s;e. Suppo&s;e it were admitted that the lives of men were to be &s;acrificed without re|mor&s;e if a paramount good were to re&s;ult, it &s;eems to me as if murder and ma&s;&s;acre were but a very left-handed way of producing civili&s;ation and love. But pray, do not you think this great hero was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort of a madman? What now will you &s;ay to his

firing the palace of Per&s;epolis, his weeping for other worlds to conquer, and his marching his whole army over the burning &s;ands of Lybia, merely to vi&s;it a temple, and per&s;uade mankind that he was the &s;on of Jupiter Ammon?</P>
<P>Alexander, my boy, has been much mi&s;under|&s;tood. Mankind have revenged them&s;elves upon him by mi&s;repre&s;entation, for having &s;o far eclip&s;ed the re&s;t of his &s;pecies. It was nece&s;&s;ary to the reali&s;ing his project that he &s;hould pa&s;s for a God. It was the only way by which he could get a firm hold upon the veneration of the &s;tupid and bi|goted Per&s;ians. It was this, and not a mad va|nity, that was the &s;ource of his proceeding. And how much had he to &s;truggle with in this re&s;pect in the unapprehending ob&s;tinacy of &s;ome of his Ma|cedonians?</P>
<P>Why then, &s;ir, at la&s;t Alexander did but employ means that all politicians profe&s;s to u&s;e, as well as he. He dragooned men into wi&s;dom, and cheated them into the pur&s;uit of their own happine&s;s. But what is wor&s;e, &s;ir, this Alexander in the paroxy&s;m of his headlong rage &s;pared neither friend nor foe. You will not pretend to ju&s;tify the exce&s;&s;es of his ungovernable pa&s;&s;ion. It is impo&s;&s;ible &s;ure that a word can be &s;aid for a man whom a momentary provocation can hurry into the commi&s;&s;ion of mur|ders&mdash;</P>
<P>The in&s;tant I had uttered the&s;e words, I felt what it was that I had done. There was a mag|netical &s;ympathy between me and my ma&s;ter, &s;o that their effect was not &s;ooner produced upon him, than my own mind reproached me with the inhumanity of the allu&s;ion. Our confu&s;ion was mutual. The blood for&s;ook at once the tran&s;parent complexion of Mr. Falkland, and then ru&s;hed back again with rapidity and fiercene&s;s. I dared not
<PB N="155" REF="028752_0157_0FDBF1045A60EA18">
utter a word, le&s;t I &s;hould commit a new error wor&s;e than that into which I had ju&s;t fallen. After a &s;hort, but &s;evere, &s;truggle to continue the conver&s;ation, Mr. Falkland began with trepidation, but afterwards became calmer:</P>
<P>You are not candid&mdash;Alexander&mdash;You mu&s;t learn more clemency&mdash;Alexander, I &s;ay, does not de&s;erve this rigour. Do you remember his tears, his remor&s;e, his determined ab&s;tinence from food, which he could &s;carcely be per&s;uaded to alter? Did not that prove acute feeling and a rooted principle of equity?&mdash;Well, well, Alexander was a true and judicious lover of mankind, and his real me|rits have been little comprehended.</P>
<P>I know not how to make the &s;tate of my mind at that moment accurately under&s;tood. When one idea has got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind, it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to keep it from finding its way to the lips. Error, once committed, has a fa&s;cinating power, like the eyes of the rattle-&s;nake, to draw us into a &s;econd error. It deprives us of that proud confi|dence in our own &s;trength, to which we are in|debted for &s;o much of our virtue. Curio&s;ity is a re&s;tle&s;s propen&s;ity, and often does but hurry us forward the more irre&s;i&s;tibly, the greater is the danger that attends its indulgence.</P>
<P>Clitus, &s;aid I, was a man of very coar&s;e and provoking manners, was he not?</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland felt the full force of this appeal. He gave me a penetrating look as if he would &s;ee my very &s;oul. His eyes were then in an in&s;tant withdrawn. I could perceive him &s;eized with a convul&s;ive &s;huddering, which, though &s;trongly counteracted, and therefore &s;carcely vi&s;ible, had I know not what of terrible in it. He left his em|ployment, &s;trode about the room in anger, his vi&s;age gradually a&s;&s;umed an expre&s;&s;ion as of &s;uper|natural

barbarity, he quitted the apartment abrupt|ly, and flung the door with a violence that &s;eemed to &s;hake the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Is this, &s;aid I, the fruit of con&s;cious guilt, or of the di&s;gu&s;t that a man of honour conceives at guilt unde&s;ervedly imputed?</P>

<P>THE reader will feel how rapidly I was advanc|ing to the brink of the precipice. I had a confu&s;ed apprehen&s;ion of what I was doing, but I could not &s;top my&s;elf. Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid I, that Mr. Falkland, who is thus overwhelmed with a &s;en&s;e of the unmerited di&s;honour that has been fa&s;tened upon him in the face of the word, will long endure the pre&s;ence of a raw and unfriended youth, who is perpetually bringing back that di&s;honour to his recollection, and who &s;eems him&s;elf the mo&s;t for|ward to entertain the accu&s;ation?</P>
<P>I felt indeed that Mr. Falkland would not ha&s;tily incline to di&s;mi&s;s me, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that re|&s;trained him from many other actions which might &s;eem to &s;avour of a too tender and ambiguous &s;en|&s;ibility. But this reflexion was little adapted to comfort me. That he &s;hould cheri&s;h in his heart a growing hatred again&s;t me, and that he &s;hould think him&s;elf obliged to retain me a continual thorn in his &s;ide, was an idea by no means of fa|vourable augury to my future peace.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time after this that in clearing out a ca&s;e of drawers I found a paper that by &s;ome acci|dent had &s;lipped behind one of the drawers, and been overlooked. At another time perhaps my curio&s;ity might have given way to the laws of de|corum, and I &s;hould have re&s;tored it unopened to my ma&s;ter, its owner. But my eagerne&s;s for in|formation had been too much &s;timulated by the preceding incidents to allow me at pre&s;ent to neglect
<PB N="158" REF="028752_0160_0FDBF0C92C0AF6A0">
any occa&s;ion of obtaining it. The paper proved to be a letter written by the elder Hawkins, and from its contents &s;eemed to have been penned when he had fir&s;t been upon the point of ab&s;conding from the per&s;ecutions of Mr. Tyrrel. It was as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honourable Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have waited &s;ome time in daily hope of your honour's return into the&s;e parts. Old Gines and his dame, who are le&s;t to take care of your hou&s;e, tell me, they cannot &s;ay when that will be, nor ju&s;tly in what part of England you are at pre&s;ent. For my &s;hare misfortune comes &s;o thick upon me, that I mu&s;t determine upon &s;omething (that is for certain), and out of hand. Our &s;quire, who I mu&s;t own at fir&s;t u&s;ed me kindly enough, though I am afraid that was partly out of &s;pite to &s;quire Underwood, has &s;ince determined to be the ruin of me. Sir, I have been no craven; I fought it up &s;toutly; for after all, you know, God ble&s;s your honour! it is but a man to a man; but he has been too much for me.</P>
<P>Perhaps if I were to ride over to the market town and enquire of Mun&s;le, your lawyer, he could tell me how to direct to you. But having hoped and waited o' this fa&s;hion, and all in vain, has put me upon other thoughts. I was in no hurry, &s;ir, to apply to you; for I do not love to be a trouble to other people. I kept that for my la&s;t &s;take. Well, &s;ir, and now that has failed me like, I am a&s;hamed as it were to have thought of it. Have not I, thinks I, arms and legs as well as other people? I am driven out of hou&s;e and home. Well, and what then? Sure I arn't a cabbage, that if you pull it out of the ground, it mu&s;t die. I am pennyle&s;s. True; and how many hundreds are there that live from hand to mouth all the days

of their life? (Begging your honour's pardon) thinks I, if we little folks had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut the wit to do for our&s;elves, the great folks would not be &s;uch maggoty changelings as they are. They would be|gin to look about them.</P>
<P>But there is another thing that has &s;wayed with me more than all the re&s;t. I do not know how to tell you, &s;ir&mdash;My poor boy, my Leonard, the pride of my life, has been three weeks in the county jail. It is true indeed, &s;ir. Squire Tyrrel put him there. Now, &s;ir, every time that I lay my head upon my pillow under my own little roof, my heart &s;mites me with the &s;ituation of my Leonard. I do not mean &s;o much for the hard&s;hip; I do not &s;o much matter that. I do not expect him to go through the world upon velvet; I am not &s;uch a fool. But who can tell what may hap in a jail? I have been three times to &s;ee him; and there is one man in the &s;ame quarter of the pri&s;on that looks &s;o wicked! I do not much fancy the looks of the re&s;t. To be &s;ure Leonard is as good a lad as ever lived. I think he will not give his mind to &s;uch. But, come what will, I am determined he &s;hall not &s;tay among them twelve hours longer. I am an ob&s;tinate old fool perhaps; but I have taken it into my head, and I will do it. Do not a&s;k me what. But, if I were to write to your honour, and wait for your an&s;wer, it might take a week or ten days more. I mu&s;t not think of it!</P>
<P>Squire Tyrrel is very head&s;trong, and you, your honour, might be a little hotti&s;h or &s;o. No, I would not have any body quarrel for me. There has been mi&s;chief enough done already; and I will get my&s;elf out of the way. So I write this, your honour, merely to unload my mind. I feel my&s;elf equally as much bound to re&s;pect and love you, as if you had done every thing for me that I believe you would have done if things had chanced dif|ferently.
<PB N="160" REF="028752_0162_0FDBF0CA951CCCE8">
It is mo&s;t likely you will never hear of me any more. If it &s;hould be &s;o, &s;et your worthy heart at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t. I know my&s;elf too well ever to be tempted to do any thing that is really bad. I have now my fortune to &s;eek in the world. I have been u&s;ed ill enough, God knows. But I bear no ma|lice; my heart is at peace with all mankind; and I forgive every body. It is like enough that poor Leonard and I may have hard&s;hip enough to un|dergo, among &s;trangers and being obliged to hide our&s;elves like hou&s;e-breakers or highwaymen. But I defy all the malice of fortune to make us do an ill thing. That con&s;olation we will always keep again&s;t all the cro&s;&s;es of a heart-breaking world.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I read this letter with con&s;iderable attention, and it occa&s;ioned me many reflections. To my way of thinking it contained a very intere&s;ting picture of a blunt, downright, hone&s;t mind. It is a me|lancholy con&s;ideration, &s;aid I to my&s;elf; but &s;uch is man! To have judged from appearances one would have &s;aid, This is a fellow, to have taken fortune's buffets and rewards with an incorruptible mind. And yet &s;ee where it all ends! This man was capable of afterwards becoming a murderer, and fini&s;hing his life at the gallows. O poverty! thou art indeed omnipotent! Thou grinde&s;t us into de&s;peration; thou confounde&s;t all our boa&s;ted and mo&s;t deep-rooted principles; thou fille&s;t us to the very brim with malice and revenge, and rendere&s;t us capable of acts of unknown horror! May I ne|ver be vi&s;ited by thee in the fulne&s;s of thy power!</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="028752_0163_0FDBF10E9E302E10">
Having &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity with re&s;pect to this paper, I took care to di&s;po&s;e of it in &s;uch a man|ner as that it &s;hould be found by Mr. Falkland; at the &s;ame time that, in obedience to the principle which at pre&s;ent governed me with ab&s;olute domi|nion, I was willing that the way in which it offer|ed it&s;elf to his attention, &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t to him the idea that it had po&s;&s;ibly pa&s;&s;ed through my hands. The next morning I &s;aw him, and I exerted my&s;elf to lead the conver&s;ation, which by this time I well knew how to introduce, by in&s;en&s;ible degrees to the point I de&s;ired. After &s;everal previous que&s;tions, remarks and rejoinders, I continued:</P>
<P>Well, &s;ir, after all, I cannot help feeling very uncomfortably as to my ideas of human nature, when I find that there is no dependence to be placed upon its per&s;everance, and that, at lea&s;t among the illiterate, the mo&s;t promi&s;ing appearan|ces may end in the foule&s;t di&s;grace.</P>
<P>You think then that literature and a cultivated mind are the only a&s;&s;urance for the con&s;tancy of our principles?</P>
<P>Um!&mdash;why do you &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ir, that learning and ingenuity do not often &s;erve people rather to hide their crimes, than to re&s;train them from com|mitting them? Hi&s;tory tells us &s;trange things in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Williams! &s;aid Mr. Falkland, a little di&s;turbed, you are &s;trangely given to cen&s;ure and &s;everity.</P>
<P>I hope not. I am &s;ure I am mo&s;t fond of look|ing on the other &s;ide of the picture, and con&s;ider|ing how many men have been a&s;per&s;ed, and even at &s;ome time or other almo&s;t torn to pieces by their fellow creatures, whom, when properly under&s;tood, we find worthy of our reverence and love.</P>
<P>Indeed, replied Mr. Falkland with a &s;igh, when I con&s;ider the&s;e things, I do not wonder at the dy|ing exclamation of Brutus, O Virtue! I &s;ought
<PB N="162" REF="028752_0164_0FDBF0CF0760A430">
thee as a &s;ub&s;tance, but I find thee an empty name! I am too much inclined to be of his opinion.</P>
<P>Why to be &s;ure, &s;ir, innocence and guilt are too much confounded in human life. I remember a very affecting &s;tory of a poor man in the reign of queen Elizabeth, who would have infallibly been hanged for murder upon the &s;trength of circum|&s;tantial evidence, if the per&s;on really concerned had not been him&s;elf upon the jury, and prevent|ed it.</P>
<P>In &s;aying this I touched the &s;pring that waken|ed madne&s;s in his mind. He came up to me with a ferocious countenance as if determined to force me into a confe&s;&s;ion of my thoughts. A &s;udden pang however &s;eemed to change his de&s;ign; he drew back with trepidation; and exclaimed, De|te&s;ted be the univer&s;e, and the laws that govern it! Honour, ju&s;tice, virtue are all the juggle of knaves! If it were in my power, I would in&s;tantly cru&s;h the whole &s;y&s;tem into nothing!</P>
<P>I replied; Oh, &s;ir! things are not &s;o bad as you imagine. The world was made for men of &s;en&s;e to do what they will with it. Its affairs cannot be better than in the direction of the ge|nuine heroes; and, as in the end they will be found the true&s;t friends of the whole, &s;o the mul|titude have nothing to do, but to look on, be fa&s;hioned and admire.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland made a powerful effort to recover his tranquillity. Williams! &s;aid he, you in&s;truct me well. You have a right notion of things, and I have great hopes of you. I will be more of a man. I will forget the pa&s;t, and do better for the time to come. The future, the future is always our own.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, &s;ir, that I have given you pain. I am afraid to &s;ay all that I think. But it is my opi|nion that mi&s;takes will ultimately be cleared up,
<PB N="163" REF="028752_0165_0FDBF110537268A8">
ju&s;tice be done, and the true &s;tate of things come to light in &s;pite of the fal&s;e colours that may for a time ob&s;cure it.</P>
<P>The idea I &s;ugge&s;ted did not give Mr. Falkland the proper degree of delight. He &s;uffered a tem|porary relap&s;e. Ju&s;tice!&mdash;he muttered. I do not know what is ju&s;tice. My ca&s;e is not within the reach of common remedies; perhaps of none. I only know that I am mi&s;erable. I began life with the be&s;t intentions and the mo&s;t fervid philanthro|py; and here I am&mdash;mi&s;erable&mdash;mi&s;erable beyond expre&s;&s;ion or endurance.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he &s;eemed &s;uddenly to recol|lect him&s;elf, and re-a&s;&s;ume his accu&s;tomed dignity and command. How came this conver&s;ation? cried he. Who gave you a right to be my confi|dent? Ba&s;e, artful wretch that you are! learn to be more re&s;pectful! Are my pa&s;&s;ions to be wound and unwound by an in&s;olent dome&s;tic? Do you think I will be an in&s;trument to be played on at your plea&s;ure, till you have extorted all the trea|&s;ures of my &s;oul? Begone, and fear le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t you be made to pay for the temerity you have already committed.</P>
<P>There was an energy and determination in the ge&s;tures with which the&s;e words were accompanied that did not admit of their being di&s;puted. My mouth was clo&s;ed; I felt as if deprived of all &s;hare of activity, and was only able &s;ilently and pa&s;&s;ive|ly to quit the apartment.</P>

<P>TWO days &s;ub&s;equent to this conver&s;ation Mr. Falkland ordered me to be called to him. [I &s;hall continue to &s;peak in my narrative of the &s;ilent, as well as the articulate part of the intercour&s;e be|tween us. His countenance was habitually ani|mated and expre&s;&s;ive much beyond that of any other man I have &s;een. The curio&s;ity, which, as I have &s;aid, con&s;tituted at this time my ruling pa&s;|&s;ion, &s;timulated me to make it my perpetual &s;tudy. It will al&s;o mo&s;t probably happen, while I am thus employed in collecting together the &s;cattered inci|dents of my hi&s;tory, that I &s;hall upon &s;ome occa|&s;ions annex to appearances an explanation, which I was far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing at the time, and was only &s;ugge&s;ted to me through the medium of &s;ub&s;equent events.]</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion Mr. Falkland's countenance exhibited an unwonted compo&s;ure. This compo|&s;ure however did not &s;eem to re&s;ult from internal ea&s;e, but from an effort which, while he prepared him&s;elf for an intere&s;ting &s;cene, was exerted to prevent his pre&s;ence of mind and power of volun|tary action from &s;uffering any diminution.</P>
<P>Williams, &s;aid he, I am determined, whatever it may co&s;t me, to have an explanation with you. You are a ra&s;h and incon&s;iderate boy, and have given me a great deal of di&s;turbance. You ought to have known that, though I allow you to talk with me upon indifferent &s;ubjects, it is very impro|per in you to lead the conver&s;ation to any thing
<PB N="165" REF="028752_0167_0FDBF1159DD55FF8">
that relates to my per&s;onal concerns. You have &s;aid many things lately in a very my&s;terious way, and appear to know &s;omething more than I am aware of. I am equally at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s how you came by your knowledge, as of what it con|&s;i&s;ts. But I think I perceive too much inclination on your part to trifle with my peace of mind. That ought not to be, nor have I de&s;erved any &s;uch treatment from you. But, be that as it will, the gue&s;&s;es in which you oblige me to employ my&s;elf are too painful. It is a &s;ort of &s;porting with my feeling, which, as a man of re&s;olution, I am de|termined to bring to an end. I expect you there|fore to lay a&s;ide all my&s;tery and equivocation, and inform me explicitly what it is upon which your allu&s;ions are built. What is it you know? What is it you want? I have been too much expo&s;ed already to an unparalleled mortification and hard|&s;hip, and my wounds will not bear this perpetual handling.</P>
<P>I feel, &s;ir, an&s;wered I, how wrong I have been, and am a&s;hamed that &s;uch a one as I &s;hould have given you all this trouble and di&s;plea&s;ure. I felt it at the time; but I have been hurried along I do not know how. I have always tried to &s;top my&s;elf, but the devil that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me was too &s;trong for me. I know nothing, &s;ir, but what Mr. Collins told me. He told me the &s;tory of Mr. Tyrrel and Mi&s;s Melvile and Hawkins. I am &s;ure, &s;ir, he &s;aid nothing but what was to your honour, and proved you to be more an angel than a man.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ir: I found a letter written by that Haw|kins the other day: did not that letter fall into your hands? Did not you read it?</P>
<P>For God's &s;ake, &s;ir, turn me out of your hou&s;e. Puni&s;h me in &s;ome way or other, that I may for|give my&s;elf. I am a fooli&s;h, wicked, de&s;picable wretch. I confe&s;s, &s;ir, I did read the letter.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="028752_0168_0FDBF0D2123ACB38">
And how dared you read it? It was indeed very wrong of you. But we will talk of that by and by. Well, and what did you &s;ay to the letter? You know it &s;eems that Hawkins was hanged.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, &s;ir? why it went to my heart to read it. I &s;ay, as I &s;aid the day before ye&s;terday, that, when I &s;ee a man of &s;o much principle, afterwards deliberately proceeding to the very wor&s;t of crimes, I can &s;carcely bear to think of it.</P>
<P>That is what you &s;ay? It &s;eems too you know, accur&s;ed remembrance! that I was tried for this crime?</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ir. You know too perhaps that, from the hour the crime was committed,&mdash;yes, &s;ir, that was the date [and, as he &s;aid this, there was &s;ome|what frightful, I had almo&s;t &s;aid diabolical, in his countenance]&mdash;I have not had an hour's peace; I became changed from the happie&s;t into the mo&s;t mi&s;erable thing that lives; &s;leep has fled from my eyes; joy has been a &s;tranger to my thoughts; and annihilation I &s;hould prefer a thou&s;and times to the being that I lead. As &s;oon as I was capable of a choice, I cho&s;e honour and the e&s;teem of mankind as a good I preferred to all others. You know, it &s;eems, in how many ways my ambition has been di&s;appointed,&mdash;I do not thank Collins for having been the hi&s;torian of my di&s;grace,&mdash;Would to God that night could be blotted from the memory of man!&mdash;But the &s;cene of that night, in&s;tead of peri&s;hing, has been a &s;ource of ever new cala|mity to me, which mu&s;t flow for ever! Am I then, thus mi&s;erable and ruined, a proper &s;ubject for you upon which to exerci&s;e your ingenuity, and improve your power of tormenting? Was it not enough that I was publicly di&s;honoured? that I was deprived by the pe&s;tilential influence of &s;ome demon of the opportunity of avenging my di&s;|honour?
<PB N="167" REF="028752_0169_0FDBF11AAEBCA150">
No: in addition to this I have been tried upon the charge of having in this critical mo|ment intercepted my own vengeance by the foule&s;t of crimes. That trial is pa&s;t. Mi&s;ery it&s;elf has nothing wor&s;e in &s;tore for me except what you have inflicted: the &s;eeming to doubt of my inno|cence which neither per&s;ecutor, nor judge, nor jury ever ventured to do. You have forced me to this explanation. You have extorted from me a confidence which I had no inclination to confer. But it is a part of the mi&s;ery of my &s;ituation, that I am at the mercy of every creature, however little, who feels him&s;elf inclined to &s;port with my di&s;|tre&s;s. Be content. You have brought me low enough.</P>
<P>Oh, &s;ir! I am not content; I cannot be con|tent! I cannot bear to think what I have done. I &s;hall never again be able to look in the face the be&s;t of ma&s;ters and the be&s;t of men. I beg of you, &s;ir, to turn me out of your &s;ervice. Let me go and hide my&s;elf where I may never &s;ee you more.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland's countenance had indicated great &s;everity through the whole of this conver&s;ation; but now it became more har&s;h and tempe&s;tuous than ever. How now, ra&s;cal! cried he. You want to leave me, do you? Who told you that I wi&s;hed to part with you? But you cannot bear to live with &s;uch a mi&s;erable wretch as I am! You are not di&s;po&s;ed to put up with the caprices of a man &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied and unju&s;t!</P>
<P>Oh, &s;ir! do not talk to me thus! Do with me any thing you will. Kill me if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Kill you! [Volumes could not de&s;cribe the emo|tions with which this echo of my words was given and received.]</P>
<P>Sir, I could die to &s;erve you! I love you more than I can expre&s;s. I wor&s;hip you as a being of a &s;uperior nature. I am fooli&s;h, raw, inexperienced,

&mdash;wor&s;e than any of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e;&mdash;but never did a thought of di&s;loyalty to your &s;ervice enter into my heart.</P>
<P>Here our conver&s;ation ended; and the impre&s;|&s;ion it made upon my youthful mind it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to de&s;cribe. I thought with a&s;toni&s;hment, even with rapture, of the attention and kindne&s;s towards me I di&s;covered in Mr. Falkland through all the roughne&s;s of his manner. I could never wonder enough at finding my&s;elf, humble as I was by my birth, ob&s;cure as I had hitherto been, thus &s;ud|denly become of &s;o much importance to the hap|pine&s;s of one of the mo&s;t enlightened and accom|pli&s;hed men in England. But this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s attached me to my ma&s;ter more eagerly than ever, and made me &s;wear a thou&s;and times as I medi|tated upon my &s;ituation, that I would never prove unworthy of &s;o generous a protector.</P>

<P>IS it not unaccountable that, in the mid&s;t of all my increa&s;ed veneration for my ma&s;ter, the fir&s;t tumult of my emotion was &s;carcely &s;ub&s;ided, before the old que&s;tion that had excited my conjectures recurred to my mind, Was he the murderer? It was a kind of fatal impul&s;e that &s;eemed de&s;tined to hurry me to de&s;truction. I did not wonder at the di&s;turbance that was given to Mr. Falkland by any allu&s;ion however di&s;tant to this fatal affair. That was as completely accounted for from the con&s;ideration of his exce&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility in matters of honour, as it would have been upon the &s;up|po&s;ition of the mo&s;t atrocious guilt. Knowing as he did, that &s;uch a charge had once been connect|ed with his name, he would of cour&s;e be perpe|tually unea&s;y, and &s;u&s;pect &s;ome latent in&s;inuation at every po&s;&s;ible opportunity. He would doubt and fear, le&s;t every man with whom he conver&s;ed harboured the foule&s;t &s;u&s;picions again&s;t him. In my ca&s;e he found that I was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome information more than he was aware of, without its being po&s;&s;ible for him to decide to what it amounted, whether I had heard a ju&s;t or unju&s;t, a candid or calumniatory tale. He had al&s;o rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that I gave entertainment to thoughts derogatory to his honour, and that I did not form that favourable judgment which the exqui&s;ite re|finement of his ruling pa&s;&s;ion made indi&s;pen&s;able to his peace. All the&s;e con&s;iderations would of cour&s;e maintain in him a &s;tate of perpetual unea&s;ine&s;s.
<PB N="170" REF="028752_0172_0FDBF0D755D83190">
But, though I could find nothing that I could con|&s;ider as ju&s;tifying me in per&s;i&s;ting in the &s;hadow of a doubt, yet, as I have &s;aid, the uncertainty and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of my contemplations would by no means depart from me.</P>
<P>The fluctuating &s;tate of my mind produced a contention of oppo&s;ite principles that by turns u&s;urped dominion over my conduct. Sometimes I was influenced by the mo&s;t complete veneration for my ma&s;ter; I placed an unre&s;erved confidence in his integrity and his virtue, and implicitly &s;urren|dered my under&s;tanding for him to &s;et it to what point he plea&s;ed. At other times the confidence, which had before flowed with the mo&s;t plenteous tide, began to ebb; I was, as I had already been, watchful, inqui&s;itive, &s;u&s;picious, full of a thou&s;and conjectures as to the meaning of the mo&s;t indif|ferent actions. Mr. Falkland, who was mo&s;t pain|fully alive to every thing that related to his honour, &s;aw the&s;e variations, and betrayed his con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of them now in one manner and now in an|other, frequently before I was my&s;elf aware, &s;ome|times almo&s;t before they exi&s;ted. The &s;ituation of both was di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; we were each of us a plague to the other; and I often wondered that the for|bearance and benignity of my ma&s;ter was not at length exhau&s;ted, and that he did not determine to thru&s;t from him for ever &s;o ince&s;&s;ant an ob&s;erver. There was indeed one eminent difference between his &s;hare in the tran&s;action and mine. I had &s;ome con&s;olation in the mid&s;t of my re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s. Curi|o&s;ity is a principle that carries its plea&s;ures as well as its pains along with it. The mind is urged by a perpetual &s;timulus; it &s;eems as if it were con|tinually approaching to the end of its race; and, as the in&s;atiable de&s;ire of &s;atisfaction is its princi|ple of conduct, &s;o it promi&s;es it&s;elf in that &s;atis|faction an unknown gratification, which &s;eems as
<PB N="171" REF="028752_0173_0FDBF11F51F58CA8">
if it were capable of fully compen&s;ating any inju|ries that may be &s;uffered in the career. But to Mr. Falkland there was no con&s;olation. What he endured in the intercour&s;e between us appeared to be all gratuitous evil. He had only to wi&s;h that there was no &s;uch per&s;on as my&s;elf in the world, and to cur&s;e the hour when his humanity led him to re&s;cue me from my ob&s;curity, and place me in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>A con&s;equence produced upon me by the ex|traordinary nature of my &s;ituation it is nece&s;&s;ary to mention. The con&s;tant &s;tate of vigilance and &s;u&s;|picion in which my mind was retained worked a very rapid change in my character. It &s;eemed to have all the effect that might have been expected from years of ob&s;ervation and experience. The &s;trictne&s;s with which I endeavoured to remark what pa&s;&s;ed in the mind of one man, and the va|riety of conjectures into which I was led, appear|ed as it were to render me a competent adept in the different modes in which the human intellect di&s;plays its &s;ecret workings. I no longer &s;aid to my&s;elf, as I had done in the beginning, "I will a&s;k Mr. Falkland whether he were the murderer." On the contrary, after having carefully examined the different kinds of evidence of which the &s;ubject was &s;u&s;ceptible, and recollecting all that had al|ready pa&s;&s;ed upon the &s;ubject, it was not with|out con&s;iderable pain that I felt my&s;elf unable to di&s;cover any way in which I could be perfectly and unalterably &s;atisfied of my ma&s;ter's innocence. As to his guilt, I could &s;carcely bring my&s;elf to doubt that in &s;ome way or other, &s;ooner or later, I &s;hould arrive at the knowledge of that, if it really exi&s;ted. But I could not endure to think almo&s;t for a moment of that &s;ide of the alternative as true; and, with all my ungovernable &s;u&s;picion, ari&s;ing from the my&s;teriou&s;ne&s;s of the circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="172" REF="028752_0174_0FDBF0DCE8C08A78">
and the delight which a young and un|fledged mind receives from ideas that give &s;cope to all that imagination can picture of terrible or &s;ub|lime, I could not yet bring my&s;elf to con&s;ider Mr. Falkland's guilt as a &s;uppo&s;ition attended with the remote&s;t probability.</P>
<P>I hope the reader will forgive me for dwelling thus long on preliminary circum&s;tances. I &s;hall come &s;oon enough to the &s;tory of my own mi&s;ery. I have already &s;aid that one of the motives which induced me to the penning of this narrative was to con&s;ole my&s;elf in my in&s;upportable di&s;tre&s;s. I derive a melancholy plea&s;ure from dwelling upon the circum&s;tances which imperceptibly paved the way to my ruin. While I recollect or de&s;cribe pa&s;t &s;cenes which occurred in a more favourable period of my life, my attention is called off for a &s;hort interval from the hopele&s;s misfortune in which I am at pre&s;ent involved. The man mu&s;t indeed po&s;&s;e&s;s an uncommon portion of hardne&s;s of heart, who can envy me &s;o &s;light a relief.&mdash;To proceed.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time after the explanation which had thus taken place between me and my ma&s;ter, his melancholy, in&s;tead of being in the &s;lighte&s;t degree dimini&s;hed by the lenient hand of time, went on perpetually to increa&s;e. His fits of in&s;anity, for &s;uch I mu&s;t denominate them for want of a di&s;tinct appellation, though it is po&s;&s;ible they might not fall under the definition that either the faculty or the court of chancery appropriate to that term, became &s;tronger and more durable than ever. It was no longer practicable wholly to conceal them from the family and even from the neighbourhood. He would &s;ometimes without any previous notice ab&s;ent him&s;elf from his hou&s;e for two or three days, unaccompanied by any &s;ervants or attendants. This was the more extraordinary, as it was well
<PB N="173" REF="028752_0175_0FDBF12492F3A388">
known that he paid no vi&s;its, nor kept up any &s;ort of intercour&s;e with the gentlemen of the vicinity. But it was impo&s;&s;ible that a man of Mr. Falkland's di&s;tinction and fortune &s;hould long continue in &s;uch a practice without its being di&s;covered what was become of him, though a con&s;iderable part of our county was among the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;olate di&s;tricts that are to be &s;ound in South Britain. Mr. Falkland was &s;ometimes &s;een climbing among the rocks, reclining motionle&s;s for hours together upon the edge of a precipice, or lulled into a kind of namele&s;s lethargy of de&s;pair by the da&s;hing of the torrents. He would remain for whole nights together under the naked cope of heaven, inatten|tive to the con&s;ideration either of place or time, in&s;en&s;ible to the variations of the weather, or rather &s;eeming to be delighted with that uproar of the elements which partially called off his attention from the di&s;cord and dejection which occupied his own mind.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, when we received intelligence at any time of the place to which Mr. Falkland had with|drawn him&s;elf, &s;ome per&s;on of his hou&s;hold, Mr. Collins or my&s;elf, but mo&s;t generally my&s;elf, as I was always at home, and always in the received &s;en&s;e of that word at lei&s;ure, went to him to per|&s;uade him to return. But after a few experiments we thought it advi&s;eable to de&s;i&s;t, and to leave my ma&s;ter to prolong his ab&s;ence, or to terminate it, as might happen to &s;uit his own inclination. Mr. Collins, who&s;e grey hairs and long &s;ervices &s;eemed to give him a &s;ort of right to be importunate, &s;ometimes &s;ucceeded; though even in that ca&s;e there was nothing that could &s;it more unea&s;y upon Mr. Falkland than this in&s;inuation as if he wanted a guardian to take care of him, or as if he were, or were in danger of, falling into a &s;tate in which he would be incapable of deliberately controuling
<PB N="174" REF="028752_0176_0FDBF0DE1201CD60">
his own words and actions. At one time he would &s;ullenly yield to his humble, venerable friend, murmuring grievou&s;ly at the con&s;traint that was put upon him, but without &s;pirit enough even to complain of it with energy. At another time, even though complying, he would &s;uddenly bur&s;t out in a paroxy&s;m of re&s;entment. Upon the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions there was &s;omething inconceivably, &s;avagely terrible in his anger, that gave to the per&s;on again&s;t whom it was directed the mo&s;t humiliating and in&s;upportable &s;en&s;ations. Me he always treated at the&s;e times with fiercene&s;s, and drove me from him with a vehemence, lofty, emphatical and &s;u&s;|tained beyond any thing of which I &s;hould have thought human nature to be capable. The&s;e &s;al|lies &s;eemed always to con&s;titute a &s;ort of cri&s;is in his indi&s;po&s;ition; and, whenever he was induced to &s;uch a premature return, he would fall imme|diately after into a &s;tate of the mo&s;t melancholy in|activity, in which he u&s;ually continued for two or three days. It was by an ob&s;tinate fatality that, whenever I &s;aw Mr. Falkland in the&s;e deplorable &s;ituations, and particularly when I lighted upon him after having &s;ought him among the rocks and precipices, pale, emaciated, &s;olitary and haggard, the &s;ugge&s;tion would continually recur to me, in &s;pite of inclination, in &s;pite of per&s;ua&s;ion, and in &s;pite of evidence, Surely this man is a murderer!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in one of the lucid intervals, as I may term them, that occurred during this period, that a pea&s;ant was brought before him, in his character of a ju&s;tice of peace, upon an accu&s;ation of having murdered his fellow. As Mr. Falkland had by this time acquired the repute of a melancholy valetudi|narian, it is probable he would not have been called upon to act in his official character upon the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion, had it not been that two or three of the neighbouring ju&s;tices were all of them from home at once, &s;o that he was the only one to be found in a circuit of many miles. The reader however mu&s;t not imagine, though I have em|ployed the word in&s;anity in de&s;cribing Mr. Falk|land's &s;ymptoms, that he was by any means reckoned for a madman by the generality of tho&s;e who had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve him. It is true that his behaviour at certain times was &s;ingular and un|accountable; but then at other times there was in it &s;o much dignity, regularity and economy; he knew &s;o well how to command and make him&s;elf re&s;pected; his actions and carriage were &s;o conde|&s;cending, con&s;iderate and benevolent; that, far from having forfeited the e&s;teem of the unfortu|nate or the many, they were loud and earne&s;t in his prai&s;es.</P>
<P>I was pre&s;ent at the examination of this pea&s;ant. The moment I heard of the errand which had brought this rabble of vi&s;itors, a &s;udden thought &s;truck me. I conceived the po&s;&s;ibility of rendering
<PB N="176" REF="028752_0178_0FDBF0DF6E40C648">
the incident &s;ubordinate to the great enquiry which drank up all the currents of my &s;oul. I &s;aid, This man is arraigned of murder, and murder is the ma&s;ter-key that wakes di&s;temper in the mind of Mr. Falkland. I will watch him without remi&s;&s;ion. I will trace all the mazes of his thought. Surely at &s;uch a time his &s;ecret angui&s;h mu&s;t betray it&s;elf. Surely, if it be not my own fault, I &s;hall now be able to di&s;cover the true &s;tate of his plea before the tribunal of unerring ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I took my &s;tation in a manner mo&s;t favourable to the object upon which my mind was intent. I could perceive in Mr. Falkland's features as he en|tered a &s;trong reluctance to the bu&s;ine&s;s in which he was engaged; but there was no po&s;&s;ibility of re|treating. His countenance was embarra&s;&s;ed and anxious; he &s;carcely &s;aw any body. The exami|nation had not proceeded far before he chanced to turn his eye to the part of the room where I was. It happened in this, as in &s;ome preceding in|&s;tances; we exchanged a &s;ilent look by which we told volumes to each other. Mr. Falkland's com|plexion turned from red to pale, and from pale to red. I perfectly under&s;tood his feelings, and would willingly have withdrawn my&s;elf. But it was impo&s;&s;ible; my pa&s;&s;ions were too deeply en|gaged; I was rooted to the &s;pot: though my own life, that of my ma&s;ter, or almo&s;t of a whole na|tion had been at &s;take, I had no power to change my po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e however having &s;ub&s;ided, Mr. Falkland a&s;&s;umed a look of determined con&s;tancy, and even &s;eemed to increa&s;e in &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion much beyond what could have been expected from his fir&s;t entrance. This he could probably have main|tained, had it not been that the &s;cene, in&s;tead of being permanent, was in &s;ome &s;ort perpetually changing. The man who was brought before him
<PB N="177" REF="028752_0179_0FDBF12639A04608">
was vehemently accu&s;ed by the brother of the de|cea&s;ed as having acted from the mo&s;t rooted ma|lice. He &s;wore that there had been an old grudge between the parties, and related &s;everal in&s;tances of it. He affirmed that the murderer had &s;ought the earlie&s;t opportunity of wreaking his revenge, had &s;truck the fir&s;t blow, and, though the conte&s;t was in appearance only a common boxing match, had watched the occa&s;ion of giving a fatal &s;troke which was followed by the in&s;tant death of his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>While the accu&s;er was giving in his evidence, the accu&s;ed di&s;covered every token of the mo&s;t poignant &s;en&s;ibility. At one time his features were convul&s;ed with angui&s;h, tears unbidden rolled down his manly cheeks; and at another be &s;tarted with a&s;toni&s;hment at the unfavourable turn that was given to the narrative, though without betraying any impatience to interrupt. I never &s;aw a man le&s;s ferocious in his appearance. He was tall, well made and comely. His countenance was ingenu|ous and benevolent, without folly. By his &s;ide &s;tood a young woman, his &s;weetheart, extremely agreeable in her per&s;on, and her looks te&s;tifying how deeply &s;he intere&s;ted her&s;elf in the fate of her lover. The accidental &s;pectators were divided between indignation again&s;t the enormity of the &s;uppo&s;ed criminal, and compa&s;&s;ion for the poor girl that accompanied him. They &s;eemed to take little notice of the favourable appearances vi&s;ible in the per&s;on of the accu&s;ed, till in the &s;equel tho&s;e appearances were more forcibly &s;ugge&s;ted to their attention. For Mr. Falkland, he was at one moment engro&s;&s;ed by curio&s;ity and earne&s;tne&s;s to inve&s;tigate the tale, while at another be betrayed a &s;ort of revul&s;ion of &s;entiment which made the inve&s;tigation too painful for him to &s;upport.</P>
<P>When the accu&s;ed was called upon for his de|fence, he readily owned the mi&s;under&s;tanding that
<PB N="178" REF="028752_0180_0FDBF0E3183812C0">
had exi&s;ted, and that the decea&s;ed was the wor&s;t enemy he had in the world. Indeed he was his only enemy, and he could not tell the rea&s;on that had made him &s;o. He had employed every po&s;&s;i|ble effort to overcome his animo&s;ity, but in vain. The decea&s;ed had upon all occa&s;ions &s;ought to mor|tify him, and do him an ill turn; but he had re|&s;olved never to be engaged in a broil with him, and till this day he had &s;ucceeded. If he had met with a misfortune with any other man, people at lea&s;t might have thought it matter of accident; but now it would always be believed that he had acted from &s;ecret malice and a bad heart.</P>
<P>The fact was that he and his &s;weetheart had gone to a neighbouring fair, where this man had met them. The man had often tried to affront him, and his pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s, interpreted into cowardice, had perhaps encouraged the other to additional rude|ne&s;s. Finding that he had endured trivial in&s;ults to him&s;elf with an even temper, the decea&s;ed now thought proper to turn his brutality upon the young woman that accompanied him. He pur&s;ued them; he endeavoured in various manners to harra&s;s and vex them; they had &s;ought in vain to &s;hake him off. The young woman was con&s;iderably terrified. The accu&s;ed expo&s;tulated with their per&s;ecutor, and a&s;ked him how he could be &s;o barbarous as to per|&s;i&s;t in frightening a woman? He replied with an in&s;ulting tone, Then the woman &s;hould find &s;ome one able to protect her; people that encouraged and tru&s;ted to &s;uch a thief as that, de&s;erved no better! The accu&s;ed tried every expedient he could invent; at length he could endure it no longer; he became exa&s;perated, and challenged the a&s;&s;ail|ant. The challenge was accepted; a ring was formed; he confided the care of his &s;weet-heart to a by&s;tander; and unfortunately the fir&s;t blow he &s;truck proved fatal.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="028752_0181_0FDBF12C6D0D18A8">
The accu&s;ed added that he did not care what became of him. He had been anxious to go through the world in an inoffen&s;ive manner, and now he had the guilt of blood upon him. He did not know but it would be a kindne&s;s in them to hang him out of the way; for his con&s;cience would re|proach him as long as he lived, and the figure of the decea&s;ed, as he had laid &s;en&s;ele&s;s and without motion at his feet, would perpetually haunt him. The thought of this man, at one moment full of life and vigour, and the next lifted a helple&s;s corp&s;e from the ground, and all owing to him, was a thought too dreadful to be endured. He had loved the poor maiden who had been the innocent occa|&s;ion of this with all his heart, but from this time he &s;hould never &s;upport the &s;ight of her. The &s;ight would bring a tribe of fiends in its rear. One unlucky minute had poi&s;oned all his hopes, and made life a burden to him.&mdash;Saying this his coun|tenance fell, the mu&s;cles of his face trembled with agony, and he looked the &s;tatue of depair.</P>
<P>This was the &s;tory of which Mr. Falkland was called upon to be the auditor. Though the incidents were for the mo&s;t part wide of tho&s;e which be|longed to the adventures we have ju&s;t related, and there had been much le&s;s policy and &s;kill di&s;|played on either part in this ru&s;tic encounter, yet there were many points which, to a man who bore the former &s;trongly in his recollection, &s;ugge&s;ted a &s;ufficient re&s;emblance. The&s;e points perpetually &s;mote upon the heart of Mr. Falkland. He at one time &s;tarted with a&s;toni&s;hment, and at another &s;hift|ed his po&s;ture like a man who is unable longer to endure the &s;en&s;ations that pre&s;s upon him. Then he new-&s;trung his nerves to &s;tubborn patience. I could &s;ee, while his mu&s;cles pre&s;erved an inflexible &s;teadine&s;s, tears of unbidden angui&s;h roll down his cheeks. He dared not tru&s;t his eyes to glance to|wards
<PB N="180" REF="028752_0182_0FDBF0E4134D3538">
the &s;ide of the room where I &s;tood; and this gave an air of embarra&s;&s;ment to his whole figure. But, when the accu&s;ed came to &s;peak of his own feelings, to de&s;cribe the depth of his compunction for an involuntary fault, he could endure it no longer. He &s;uddenly ro&s;e, and with every mark of horror and de&s;pair ru&s;hed out of the room.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance made no material difference in the affair of the accu&s;ed. The parties were de|tained about half an hour. Mr. Falkland had al|ready heard the material parts of the evidence in per&s;on. At the expiration of that interval, he &s;ent for Mr. Collins out of the room. The &s;tory of the culprit was confirmed by many witne&s;&s;es who had &s;een the tran&s;action. Word was brought that my ma&s;ter was indi&s;po&s;ed, and at the &s;ame time the accu&s;ed was ordered to be di&s;charged. The ven|geance of the brother however, as I afterwards un|der&s;tood, did not re&s;t here, and he &s;ound a magi|&s;trate more &s;crupulous or more de&s;potic, by whom the culprit was committed.</P>
<P>This affair was no &s;ooner concluded than I ha&s;ten|ed into the garden, and plunged into the deepe&s;t of its thickets. My mind was full almo&s;t to bur&s;ting. I no &s;ooner conceived my&s;elf &s;ufficiently removed from all ob&s;ervation, than my thoughts forced their way &s;pontaneou&s;ly to my tongue, and I exclaimed in a &s;it of uncontroulable enthu&s;ia&s;m: "This is the murderer! the Hawkinses were innocent! I am &s;ure of it! I will pledge my life of it! It is out! It is di&s;covered! Guilty upon my &s;oul!"</P>
<P>While I thus proceeded with ha&s;ty &s;teps along the mo&s;t &s;ecret paths of the garden, and from time to time gave vent to the tumult of my thoughts in involuntary exclamations, I felt as if my animal &s;y&s;tem had undergone a total revolution. My blood boiled within me. I was con&s;cious to a kind of rap|ture for which I could not account. I was &s;olemn,
<PB N="181" REF="028752_0183_0FDBF12D92A141B0">
yet full of rapid emotion, burning with indigna|tion and energy. In the very tempe&s;t and hurri|cane of the pa&s;&s;ions, I &s;eemed to enjoy the mo&s;t &s;oul-ravi&s;hing calm. I cannot better expre&s;s the then &s;tate of my mind, than by &s;aying, I was ne|ver &s;o perfectly alive as at that moment.</P>
<P>This &s;tate of mental elevation continued for &s;e|veral hours, but at length &s;ub&s;ided and gave place to more deliberate reflection. One of the fir&s;t que&s;tions that then occurred was, What &s;hall I do with the knowlege I have been &s;o eager to acquire? I had no inclination to turn informer. I felt, what I had had no previous conception of, that it was po&s;&s;ible to love a murderer, and, as I then under|&s;tood it, the wor&s;t of murderers. I conceived it to be in the highe&s;t degree ab&s;urd and iniquitous to cut off a man qualified for the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and exten&s;ive utility merely out of retro&s;pect to an act which, whatever were its merits, could not now be retrieved.</P>
<P>This thought led me to another which had at fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed. If I had been di&s;po&s;ed to turn informer, what had occurred amounted to no evidence that was admi&s;&s;ible in a court of ju&s;tice. Well then, added I, if it be &s;uch as would not be admitted at a criminal tribunal, am I &s;ure it is &s;uch as I ought to admit? There were twenty per&s;ons be&s;ide my&s;elf pre&s;ent at the &s;cene from which I pre|tend to derive &s;uch entire conviction. Not one of them &s;aw it in the light that I did. It either ap|peared to them a ca&s;ual and unimportant circum|&s;tance, or they thought it &s;ufficiently accounted for by Mr. Falkland's infirmity and misfortunes. Did it really contain &s;uch an extent of arguments and application, that nobody but I was di&s;cerning enough to &s;ee?</P>
<P>But all this rea&s;oning produced no alteration in my way of thinking. For this time I could not
<PB N="182" REF="028752_0184_0FDBF0E6544911C8">
get it out of my mind for a moment: "Mr. Falk|land is the murderer! He is guilty! I &s;ee it! I feel it! I am &s;ure of it!" Thus was I hurried along by an uncontroulable de&s;tiny. The &s;tate of my pa&s;&s;ions in their progre&s;&s;ive career, the inqui&s;itive|ne&s;s and impatience of my thoughts, appeared to make this determination unavoidable.</P>
<P>An incident occured while I was in the garden, that &s;eemed to make no impre&s;&s;ion upon me at the time, but which I recollected when my thoughts were got into &s;omewhat of a &s;lower motion. In the mid&s;t of one of my paroxy&s;ms of exclamation, and when I thought my&s;elf mo&s;t alone, the &s;hadow of a man as avoiding me pa&s;&s;ed tran&s;iently by me at a &s;mall di&s;tance. Though I had &s;carcely caught a faint glimp&s;e of his per&s;on, there was &s;omething in the occurrence that per&s;uaded me it was Mr. Falkland. I &s;huddered at the po&s;&s;ibility of his having overheard the words of my &s;oliloquy. But this idea, alarming as it was, had not power im|mediately to &s;u&s;pend the career of my reflections. Sub&s;equent circum&s;tances however brought back the apprehen&s;ion to my mind. I had &s;carcely a doubt of its reality, when dinner time came, and Mr. Falkland was not to be found. Supper and bed-time pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner. The only conclu&s;ion made by his &s;ervants upon this circum|&s;tance was, that he was gone upon one of his ac|cu&s;tomed melancholy rambles.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE period at which my &s;tory is now arrived &s;eemed as if it were the very cri&s;is of the fortune of Mr. Falkland. Incident followed upon incident in a kind of breathle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. About nine o'clock the next morning an alarm was given that one of the chimnies of the hou&s;e was on fire. No accident could be apparently more trivial; but pre|&s;ently it blazed with &s;uch fury, as to make it clear that &s;ome beam of the hou&s;e, which in the fir&s;t building had been improperly placed, had been reached by the flames. Some danger was appre|hended for the whole edifice. The confu&s;ion was the greater, in con&s;equence of the ab&s;ence of the ma&s;ter, as well as of Mr. Collins, the &s;teward. While &s;ome of the dome&s;tics were employed in endeavouring to extingui&s;h the flames, it was thought proper that others &s;hould bu&s;y them&s;elves in removing the mo&s;t valuable moveables to a lawn in the garden. I took &s;ome command in the affair, to which indeed my &s;tation in the family &s;eemed to entitle me, and for which I was thought qua|lified by my under&s;tanding and mental re&s;ources.</P>
<P>Having given &s;ome general directions, I con|ceived that it was not enough to &s;tand by and &s;u|perintend, but that I &s;hould contribute my per&s;onal labour in the public concern. I &s;et out for that purpo&s;e; and my &s;teps by &s;ome my&s;terious fatality were directed to the private apartment at the end of the library. Here, as I looked round, my eye
<PB N="184" REF="028752_0186_0FDBF0EA75F01718">
was &s;uddenly caught by the che&s;t mentioned in the fir&s;t pages of my narrative.</P>
<P>My mind was already rai&s;ed to its utmo&s;t pitch. In a window-&s;eat of the room lay a parcel of chi&s;|&s;els and other carpenter's tools. I know not what infatuation in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;eized me. The idea was too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted. I forgot the bu&s;i|ne&s;s upon which I came, the employment of the &s;ervants and the urgency of general danger. I &s;hould have done the &s;ame, if the apartment round me had been in flames. I &s;natched a tool &s;uitable for the purpo&s;e, threw my&s;elf upon the ground, and applied with eagerne&s;s to a magazine which inclo&s;ed all for which my heart panted. After two or three efforts, in which the energy or uncontroul|able pa&s;&s;ion was added to my bodily &s;trength, the fa&s;tenings gave way, the che&s;t opened, and all that I &s;ought was at once within my reach.</P>
<P>I was in the act of lifting up the lid, when Mr. Falkland entered, wild, breathle&s;s, di&s;traction in his looks! He had been brought home from a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance by the &s;ight of the flames. At the moment of his appearance the lid dropt down from my hand. He no &s;ooner &s;aw me, than his eyes emitted &s;parks of rage. He ran with eager|ne&s;s to a brace of loaded pi&s;tols which hung up in the room, and, &s;eizing one, pre&s;ented it to my head. I &s;aw his de&s;ign, and &s;prang to avoid it; but with the &s;ame rapidity with which he had form|ed his re&s;olution, he changed it, and in&s;tantly went to the window and &s;lung the pi&s;tol into the court below. He bade me begone with his u&s;ual irre&s;i&s;ti|ble energy; and, overcome as I was already by the horror of the detection, I eagerly complied.</P>
<P>A moment after a con&s;iderable part of the chim|ney was tumbled with noi&s;e into the court below, and a voice exclaimed that the fire was more vio|lent than ever. The&s;e circum&s;tances &s;eemed to
<PB N="185" REF="028752_0187_0FDBF13450D30D78">
produce a mechanical effect upon my ma&s;ter, who, having fir&s;t locked the clo&s;et, appeared on the out|&s;ide of the hou&s;e, a&s;cended the roof, and was in a moment in every place where his pre&s;ence was re|quired. The flames were pre&s;ently extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The reader can with difficulty form a concep|tion of the &s;tate to which I was now reduced. My act was in &s;ome &s;ort an act of in&s;anity; but how unde&s;cribable are the feelings with which I looked back upon it! It was an in&s;tantaneous impul&s;e, a &s;hort lived and pa&s;&s;ing alienation of mind; but what mu&s;t Mr. Falkland think of that alienation? To any man a per&s;on, who had once &s;hown him|&s;elf capable of &s;o wild a flight of the mind, mu&s;t appear dangerous; how mu&s;t he appear to a man under Mr. Falkland's circum&s;tances? I had ju&s;t had a pi&s;tol held to my head by a man re&s;olved to put a period to my exi&s;tence. That indeed was pa&s;t; but what was it that fate had yet in re&s;erve for me! The in&s;atiable vengeance of a Falkland, of a man who&s;e hands were to my apprehen&s;ion red with blood and his thoughts familiar with cru|elty and murder. How great were the re&s;ources of his mind, re&s;ources henceforth to be confede|rated for my de&s;truction! This was the termina|tion of an ungoverned curio&s;ity, an impul&s;e that I had repre&s;ented to my&s;elf as &s;o innocent and &s;o venial.</P>
<P>In the high tide of boiling pa&s;&s;ion I had over|looked all con&s;equences. It now appeared to me like a dream. Is it in man to leap from the high|rai&s;ed precipice, or ru&s;h unconcerned into the mid&s;t of flames? Was it po&s;&s;ible I could have forgotten for a moment the awe-creating manners of Falk|land, and the inexorable fury I &s;hould awake in his &s;oul? No thought of future &s;ecurity had reach|ed my mind. I had acted upon no plan. I had conceived no means of concealing my deed, after
<PB N="186" REF="028752_0188_0FDBF0EC567F9520">
it had once been effected. But it was over now. One &s;hort minute had effected a rever&s;e in my &s;itu|ation, the &s;uddenne&s;s of which the hi&s;tory of man perhaps is unable to &s;urpa&s;s.</P>
<P>I have always been at a lo&s;s to account for my having plunged thus headlong into an act &s;o mon|&s;trous. There is &s;omething in it of unremarked and involuntary &s;ympathy. One &s;entiment flows by nece&s;&s;ity of nature into another &s;entiment of the &s;ame general character. This was the fir&s;t in|&s;tance in which I had witne&s;&s;ed a danger by fire. All was confu&s;ion around me, and all changed in|to hurricane within. The general &s;ituation to my unpracti&s;ed apprehen&s;ion partook of de&s;perate, and I by contagion became alike de&s;perate. At fir&s;t I had been in &s;ome degree calm and collected, but that too was a de&s;perate effort, and when it gave way, a kind of in&s;tant in&s;anity became its &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>I had now every thing to fear. And yet what was my fault? It proceeded from none of tho&s;e errors which are ju&s;tly held up to the aver&s;ion of mankind; my object had been neither wealth, nor the means of indulgence, nor the u&s;urpation of power. No &s;park of malignity had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">arboured in my &s;oul. I had always reverenced the &s;ublime mind of Mr. Falkland; I reverenced it &s;till. My offence had merely been a mi&s;taken thir&s;t of know|ledge. Such however it was as to admit neither of forgivene&s;s nor remi&s;&s;ion. This epoch was the cri&s;is of my fate, dividing what may be called the offen&s;ive part, from the defen&s;ive which was the &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s of my remaining years. Alas, my offence was &s;hort, not aggravated by any &s;ini&s;ter intention: but the repri&s;als I was to &s;uffer, are long, and can terminate only with my life!</P>
<P>In the &s;tate in which I found my&s;elf, when the recollection of what I had done flowed back upon
<PB N="187" REF="028752_0189_0FDBF139AF19C128">
my mind, I was incapable of any re&s;olution. All was chaos and uncertainty within me. My thoughts were too full of horror to be &s;u&s;ceptible of activity. I felt de&s;erted of my intellectual powers, pal&s;ied in mind, and compelled to &s;it in &s;peechle&s;s expecta|tion of the mi&s;ery to which I was de&s;tined. To my own conception I was like a man, who, though bla&s;ted with lightning and deprived for ever of the power of motion, &s;hould yet retain the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of his &s;ituation. Death-dealing de&s;pair was the only idea of which I was &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>I was &s;till in this &s;ituation of mind when Mr. Falkland &s;ent for me. His me&s;&s;age roufed me from my trance. In recovering I felt tho&s;e &s;ickening and loath&s;ome &s;en&s;ations, which a man may be &s;up|po&s;ed at fir&s;t to endure who &s;hould return from the &s;leep of death. Gradually I recovered the power of arranging my ideas and directing my &s;teps. I under&s;tood that the minute the affair of the chim|ney was over Mr. Falkland had retired to his own room. It was evening before he ordered me to be called.</P>
<P>I found in him every token of extreme di&s;tre&s;s, except that there was an air of &s;olemn and &s;ad com|po&s;ure that crowned the whole. For the pre&s;ent all appearance of gloom, &s;tateline&s;s and au&s;terity was gone. As I entered, he looked up, and, &s;ee|ing who it was, ordered me to bolt the door. I obeyed. He him&s;elf went round the room, and examined all its other avenue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. He then returned to where I was. I trembled in every joint of my frame. I exclaimed within my&s;elf, "What bloody <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;cene has Ro&s;cius now to act?"</P>
<P>Williams, &s;aid he, in a tone that had more in it of &s;orrow than re&s;entment, I have attempted your life! I am a wretch devoted to the &s;corn and execration of mankind!&mdash;There he &s;topped.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="028752_0190_0FDBF0F2277ACFC0">
If there be one being in the whole earth, that feels the &s;corn and execration due to &s;uch a wretch more &s;trongly than another, it is my&s;elf. I have been kept in a &s;tate of perpetual torture and mad|ne&s;s. But I can put an end to it and its con&s;e|quences; and, &s;o far at lea&s;t as relates to you, I am determined to do it. I know the price, and&mdash;I will make the purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t &s;wear, &s;aid he. You mu&s;t atte&s;t every &s;acrament, divine and human, never to di&s;clo&s;e what I am now to tell you.&mdash;He dictated the oath, and I repeated it with an aching heart. I had no power to offer a word of remark.</P>
<P>This confidence, &s;aid he, is of your &s;eeking, not of mine. It is odious to me, as it is dangerous to you.</P>
<P>Having thus prefaced the di&s;clo&s;ure he had to make, he pau&s;ed. He &s;eemed to collect him&s;elf as for an effort of magnitude. He wiped his face with his handkerchief. The moi&s;ture that incom|moded him appeared not to be tears, but &s;weat.</P>
<P>Look at me. Ob&s;erve me. Is it not &s;trange that &s;uch a one as I &s;hould retain lineaments of a human creature? I am the blacke&s;t of villains. I am the murderer of Tyrrel. I am the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of the Hawkin&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted, as if I had trod upon a rattle-&s;nake.</P>
<P>What a &s;tory is mine! In&s;ulted, di&s;graced, pol|luted in the face of hundreds, I was capable of any act of de&s;peration. I watched my opportunity, followed Mr. Tyrrel from the rooms, &s;eized a &s;harp-pointed knife that fell in my way, came behind him, and &s;tabbed him to the heart. My gigantic oppre&s;&s;or rolled at my feet.</P>
<P>All are but links of one chain. A blow! A murder! My next bu&s;ine&s;s was to defend my&s;elf, to tell &s;o well dige&s;ted a lie, as that all mankind
<PB N="189" REF="028752_0191_0FDBF13ED34BB668">
&s;hould believe it true. Never was a ta&s;k &s;o har|rowing and intolerable!</P>
<P>Well: thus far fortune favoured me. She fa|voured me beyond my de&s;ire. The guilt was re|moved from me, and ca&s;t upon another; but this I was to endure. Whence came the circum&s;tantial evidence again&s;t him, the broken knife and the blood, I am unable to tell. I &s;uppo&s;e by &s;ome mi|raculous accident he was pa&s;&s;ing by, and endea|voured to a&s;&s;i&s;t his oppre&s;&s;or in the agonies of death. You have heard Hawkins's &s;tory; you have read one of his letters. But you do not know the thou&s;andth part of the proofs of his &s;imple and unalterable rectitude that I have known. His &s;on &s;uffered with him, that &s;on for the &s;ake of who&s;e happine&s;s and virtue he ruined him&s;elf, and would have died a hundred times.&mdash;I have had feelings, but I cannot de&s;cribe them.</P>
<P>This it is to be a gentleman! a man of honour! I was the fool of fame. My virtue, my hone&s;ty, my everla&s;ting peace of mind were cheap &s;acrifices to be made at the &s;hine of this divinity. But, what is wor&s;e, there is nothing that has happened that has in any degree contributed to my cure. I am as much the fool of fame as ever, I cling to it to my la&s;t breath. Though I be the blacke&s;t of villains, I will leave behind me a &s;potle&s;s and il|lu&s;trious name. There is no crime &s;o malignant, no &s;cene of blood &s;o horrible, in which that object cannot engage me. It is no matter that I regard the&s;e things at a di&s;tance with aver&s;ion;&mdash;I am &s;ure of it; bring me to the te&s;t, and I &s;hall yield. I de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf; but thus I am; things are gone too far to be recalled.</P>
<P>Why is it that I am compelled to this confi|dence? From the love of fame. I &s;hould tremble at the &s;ight of every pi&s;tol, or in&s;trument of death that offered it&s;elf to my hands; and perhaps my

next murder may not be &s;o fortunate as tho&s;e I have already committed. I had no alternative but to make you my confident or my victim. It was better to tru&s;t you with the whole truth under every &s;eal of &s;ecrecy, than to live in perpetual fear of your penetration or your ra&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>Do you know what it is you have done? To gratify a fooli&s;hly inqui&s;itive humour you have &s;old your&s;elf. You &s;hall continue in my &s;ervice, but can never &s;hare in my affection. I will bene|fit you in re&s;pect of fortune, but I &s;hall always hate you. If ever an unguarded word e&s;cape from your lips, if ever you excite my jealou&s;y or &s;u&s;pi|cion, expect to pay for it by your death or wor&s;e. It is a dear bargain you have made. But it is too late to look back. I charge and adjure you by every thing that is &s;acred and that is tremendous, pre&s;erve your faith!</P>
<P>My tongue has now for the fir&s;t time for &s;everal years &s;poken the language of my heart; and the intercour&s;e from this hour &s;hall be &s;hut for ever. I want no pity. I de&s;ire no con&s;olation. Sur|rounded as I am with horrors, I will at lea&s;t pre|&s;erve my fortitude to the la&s;t. If I had been re|&s;erved to a different de&s;tiny, I have qualities in that re&s;pect worthy of a better cau&s;e. I can be mad, mi&s;erable and frantic, but even in frenzy I can pre|&s;erve my pre&s;ence of mind and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tory I had been &s;o earne&s;tly de|&s;irous to know. Though my mind had brooded upon the &s;ubject for months, there was not a &s;yl|lable of it that did not come to my ear with the mo&s;t perfect &s;en&s;e of novelty. Mr. Falkland is a murderer! &s;aid I, as I retired from the conference. This dreadful appellative "a murderer," made my very blood run cold within me. He killed Mr. Tyrrel, for he could not controul his re&s;entment and anger: he &s;acrificed Hawkins the elder and
<PB N="191" REF="028752_0193_0FDBF140512A4598">
Hawkins the younger, becau&s;e he could upon no terms endure the public lo&s;s of honour: how can I expect that a man thus pa&s;&s;ionate and unrelenting will not &s;ooner or later make me his victim?</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this terrible application of the &s;tory, an application to which perhaps in &s;ome form or other mankind are indebted for nine-tenths of their abhorrence again&s;t vice, I could not help occa&s;ionally recurring to reflections of an oppo&s;ite nature. Mr. Falkland is a murderer! re&s;umed I. He might yet be a mo&s;t excellent man, if he did but think &s;o. It is the thinking our&s;elves vicious then, that principally contributes to make us vi|cious?</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the &s;hock I received from finding, what I had never &s;uffered my&s;elf con&s;tantly to believe, that my &s;u&s;picions were true; I &s;till di&s;covered new cau&s;e of admiration for my ma&s;ter. His menaces indeed were terrible. But, when I re|collected the offence I had given, &s;o contrary to every received principle of civilized &s;ociety, &s;o in|&s;olent and rude, &s;o intolerable to a man of Mr. Falkland's elevation and in Mr. Falkland's pecu|liarity of circum&s;tances, I was a&s;toni&s;hed at his forbearance. There were indeed &s;ufficiently ob|vious rea&s;ons why he might not choo&s;e to proceed to extremities with me. But how different from the fearful expectations I had conceived were the calmne&s;s of his behaviour and the regulated mild|ne&s;s of his language! In this re&s;pect I for a &s;hort time imagined that I was emancipated from the mi&s;chiefs which had appalled me, and that in hav|ing to do with a man of Mr. Falkland's liberality I had nothing rigorous to apprehend.</P>
<P>It is a mi&s;erable pro&s;pect, &s;aid I, that he holds up to me. He imagines that I am re&s;trained by no principles, and deaf to the claims of per&s;onal excellence. But he &s;hall find him&s;elf mi&s;taken. I
<PB N="192" REF="028752_0194_0FDBF0F493B66300">
will never become an informer. I will never in|jure my ma&s;ter; and therefore he will not be my enemy. With all his misfortunes and all his er|rors, I feel that my &s;oul yearns for his welfare. If he have been criminal, that is owing to circum|&s;tances; the &s;ame qualities under other circum|&s;tances would have been, or rather were &s;ublimely beneficent.</P>
<P>My rea&s;onings were no doubt infinitely more fa|vourable to my ma&s;ter than tho&s;e which human beings are accu&s;tomed to make in the ca&s;e of &s;uch as they &s;tyle great criminals. This will not be wondered at, when it is con&s;idered that I had my|&s;elf ju&s;t been trampling on the e&s;tabli&s;hed boun|daries of obligation, and therefore might well have a fellow-feeling for other offenders. Add to which, I had known Mr. Falkland from the fir&s;t as a beneficent divinity. I had ob&s;erved at lei&s;ure and with a minutene&s;s which could not deceive me the excellent qualities of his heart, and I found him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mind beyond compari&s;on the mo&s;t fertile and accompli&s;hed I had ever known.</P>
<P>But, though the terrors which had impre&s;&s;ed me were con&s;iderably alleviated, my &s;ituation was not|with&s;tanding &s;ufficiently mi&s;erable. The ea&s;e and light-heartedne&s;s of my youth were for ever gone. The voice of an irre&s;i&s;tible nece&s;&s;ity had command|ed me to "&s;leep no more." I was tormented with a con&s;cious &s;ecret of which I mu&s;t never di&s;bur|then my&s;elf; and this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s was at my age a &s;ource of perpetual melancholy. I had made my&s;elf a pri&s;oner, in the mo&s;t intolerable &s;en&s;e of that term, for years, perhaps for the re&s;t of my life. Though my prudence and di&s;cretion &s;hould be invariable, I mu&s;t remember that I &s;hould have an over&s;eer, vigilant from con&s;cious guilt, full of re&s;entment at the unju&s;tifiable means by which I had extorted from him a confe&s;&s;ion, and who&s;e
<PB N="193" REF="028752_0195_0FDBF14474E08B78">
lighte&s;t caprice might at any time decide upon every thing that was dear to me. The vigilance even of a public and &s;y&s;tematical de&s;poti&s;m is poor, com|pared with a vigilance which is thus goaded by the mo&s;t anxious pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul. Again&s;t this &s;pecies of per&s;ecution I knew not how to invent a refuge. I dared neither fly from the ob&s;ervation of Mr. Falkland, nor continue expo&s;ed to its opera|tion. I was at fir&s;t indeed lulled in a certain de|gree to &s;ecurity upon the verge of the precipice. But it was not long before I found a thou&s;and cir|cum&s;tances perpetually reminding me of my true &s;ituation. Tho&s;e I am now to relate are among the mo&s;t memorable.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<P>IN no long time after the di&s;clo&s;ure Mr. Falkland had made. Mr. Fore&s;ter, his elder brother by the mother's &s;ide, came to re&s;ide for a &s;hort period in our family. This was a circum&s;tance peculiarly adver&s;e to my ma&s;ter's habits and inclinations. He had broken off, as I have already &s;aid, all inter|cour&s;e of vi&s;iting his neighbours. He debarred him&s;elf every kind of amu&s;ement and relaxation. He &s;hrunk from the &s;ociety of his fellows, and thought he could never be &s;ufficiently buried in ob&s;curity and &s;olitude. This principle was in mo&s;t ca&s;es of no difficult execution to a man of firmne&s;s. But Mr. Falkland knew not how to avoid the vi&s;it of Mr. Fore&s;ter. This gentleman was ju&s;t return|ed from a re&s;idence of &s;everal years upon the con|tinent, and his demand of an apartment in the hou&s;e of his half-brother till his own hou&s;e at the di&s;tance of thirty miles &s;hould be prepared for his reception, was made with an air of confidence that &s;carcely admitted of a refu&s;al. Mr. Falkland could only &s;ay that the &s;tate of his health and &s;pirits was &s;uch, that he feared a re&s;idence at his hou&s;e would be little agreeable to his kin&s;man; and Mr. Fore&s;|ter conceived that this was a di&s;qualification which would always augment in proportion as it was tolerated, and hoped that his &s;ociety, by inducing Mr. Falkland to &s;u&s;pend his habits of &s;eclu&s;ion, would be the means of e&s;&s;ential benefit. Mr. Falk|land oppo&s;ed him no farther. He would have been &s;orry to be thought unkind to a kin&s;man for
<PB N="195" REF="028752_0197_0FDBF145B6B5C878">
whom he had a particular e&s;teem; and the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of not daring to a&s;&s;ign the true rea&s;on, made him cautious of adhering to his objection.</P>
<P>The character of Mr. Fore&s;ter was in many re&s;pects the rever&s;e of that of my ma&s;ter. Like him he had &s;een much of the world; but to judge of him from the unfa&s;hioned bluntne&s;s of his manner, you would have thought he had never &s;tirred from his fire-&s;ide. Yet under this rude ex|terior it was ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h various knowledge, nice di&s;crimination, and a &s;trong and active mind. Nor was it ill-humour or mi&s;anthropy that gave this turn to Mr. Fore&s;ter's behaviour. He di&s;claimed exaggeration of every kind, and was equally aver&s;e to the cynic who paints every thing in the mo&s;t &s;plenetic colours, and the &s;anguine enthu&s;ia&s;t to whom the whole appears to be exactly as it ought. In the mean time, while he hated exaggeration, he was him&s;elf one of its gro&s;&s;e&s;t dupes. He was po&s;itive in all things, even where good &s;en&s;e re|quired him to be &s;ceptical; and he roughly imputed perver&s;ene&s;s, where true wi&s;dom would have taught him to correct mi&s;take. The &s;ame incon|&s;i&s;tency followed him throughout. Full of origi|nality and genius, he pretended to de&s;pi&s;e them in others. His favourite principle was to care nothing for what the world &s;hould &s;ay, and to aim only at doing right. So long as that debt was di&s;charged, he would not &s;toop to purcha&s;e, at the expence of moving a finger, the applau&s;e of mankind in prefe|rences to their hatred. He believed that the credit which is &s;ometimes given to men of ability, was the di&s;hone&s;t gains of a combination, not the ju&s;t reward of merit; and he took plea&s;ure in &s;tating this opinion in its har&s;he&s;t form. He held that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hone&s;t ploughman is a more u&s;eful member of &s;ociety, than all the poets and philo&s;ophers that ever exi&s;ted. In a word, Mr. Fore&s;ter was one of
<PB N="196" REF="028752_0198_0FDBF17714C5AC38">
tho&s;e men who, with every &s;eeming requi&s;ite for the di&s;covery of important truth, are all their lives in &s;ubjection to the mo&s;t contemptible prejudices.</P>
<P>The peculiarities of this gentleman's character were not undi&s;played in the &s;cene to which he was now introduced. Having much kindne&s;s in his di&s;|po&s;ition, he &s;oon became deeply intere&s;ted in the unhappine&s;s of his relation. He did every thing in his power to remove it; but his attempts were rude and un&s;kilful. He exhorted his ho&s;t to pluck up a &s;pirit, and defy the foul fiend; but the tone of his exhortations found no &s;ympathetic chord in the mind of Mr. Falkland. The more he ex|plained the articles of his creed, the more irrecon|cileable did they appear with tho&s;e of my ma&s;ter. He had not the &s;kill to carry conviction to an un|der&s;tanding &s;o well fortified in error; and the le&s;s &s;o as the effort of his reflections had long been turned to a bold and intelligible enunciation of principles, rather than to analy&s;ing the rudiments out of which they were formed. In a word, after a thou&s;and efforts of kindne&s;s to his entertainer, he drew off his forces, growling and di&s;&s;atisfied with his own impotence, rather than angry at the ob&s;tinacy of Mr. Falkland. He felt no diminution of his affection for him, and was &s;incerely grieved to find that he did him &s;o little good. Both par|ties in this ca&s;e did ju&s;tice to the merits of the other; at the &s;ame time that the di&s;parity of their humours was &s;uch as to prevent the &s;tranger from being even a dangerous companion to the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e. They had &s;carcely any points of contact in their characters; Mr. Fore&s;ter was in|capable of giving Mr. Falkland that degree either of pain or plea&s;ure, which can rai&s;e the &s;oul into a tumult and deprive it for a while of tranquillity and &s;elf-command.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="028752_0199_0FDBD6CA72C183D8">
Our vi&s;itor was a man of an extremely commu|nicative di&s;po&s;ition, and he began to feel him&s;elf painfully out of his element upon the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion. Mr. Falkland was devoted to contempla|tion and &s;olitude. He put upon him&s;elf &s;ome de|gree of re&s;traint upon the arrival of his kin&s;man, though even then his darling habits would break out. But when they had &s;een each other a certain number of times, and it was &s;ufficiently evident that the &s;ociety of either would be a burthen rather than a plea&s;ure to the other, they con&s;ented by a &s;ort of &s;ilent compact that each &s;hould be at liberty to follow his own inclination. Mr. Falkland was in a certain &s;en&s;e the greate&s;t gainer by this. He returned to the habits of his choice, and acted as nearly as po&s;&s;ible ju&s;t as he would have done if Mr. Fore&s;ter had not been in exi&s;tence. But the latter was wholly at a lo&s;s. He had all the di&s;advantages of retirement, without being able, as he might have done at his hou&s;e, to bring his own a&s;&s;ociates or his own amu&s;ements about him.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation he ca&s;t his eyes upon me. It was his principle to do every thing that his thoughts &s;ugge&s;ted, without caring for the forms of the world. He &s;aw no rea&s;on why a pea&s;ant, with certain advantages of education and opportunity, might not be as eligible a companion as a lord: at the &s;ame time that he was deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the venerablene&s;s of old in&s;titutions. Reduced as he was to a kind of la&s;t re&s;ort, he &s;ound me better qualified for his purpo&s;e than any other per&s;on of Mr. Falkland's hou&s;hold. My habitual &s;implicity was extremely agreeable to him: and, be it ob|&s;erved by the way, he loved to countenance the appearance of talents, while he profe&s;&s;ed to be their enemy.</P>
<P>The manner in which he began this &s;ort of cor|re&s;pondence was &s;ufficiently characteri&s;tical. It
<PB N="198" REF="028752_0200_0FDBF149C04B12C0">
was abrupt; but it was &s;trongly &s;tamped with e&s;&s;en|tial benevolence. It was blunt and humorous; but there was attractivene&s;s, e&s;pecially in a ca&s;e of un|equal intercour&s;e, in that very ru&s;ticity by which he levelled him&s;elf with the great bulk of his &s;pe|cies. He had to reconcile him&s;elf, as well as to invite me; not to reconcile him&s;elf to the po&s;t|poning an ari&s;tocratical vanity, for of that he had a very &s;lender portion, but to the trouble of invi|tation, for he loved his ea&s;e. All this produced &s;ome irregularity and indeci&s;ion in his own mind, and gave a very whim&s;ical impre&s;&s;ion to his beha|viour.</P>
<P>On my part I was by no means ungrateful for the di&s;tinction that was paid me. My mind had been relaxed into temporary dejection, but my re|&s;erve had no alloy of moro&s;ene&s;s or in&s;en&s;ibility. It did not long hold out again&s;t the conde&s;cending attentions of Mr. Fore&s;ter. I became gradually heedful, encouraged, confiding. I had a mo&s;t eager thir&s;t for the knowledge of mankind; and, though no per&s;on perhaps ever purcha&s;ed &s;o dearly the in&s;tructions he received in that &s;chool, the in|clination was in no degree dimini&s;hed. Mr. Fo|re&s;ter was the &s;econd man I had &s;een who &s;eemed almo&s;t as much worth being &s;tudied as Mr. Falk|land him&s;elf. I was glad to e&s;cape from the un|ea&s;ine&s;s of my thoughts; and, while engaged with this new friend, I forgot the criticalne&s;s of the evils with which I was hourly menaced.</P>
<P>Stimulated by the&s;e feelings on either part we were never at a lo&s;s for &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation. The ob&s;ervations Mr. Fore&s;ter had made in his travels, the &s;et of opinions he had formed to him|&s;elf, all amu&s;ed and intere&s;ted me. His manner of telling a &s;tory or explaining his thoughts was forcible, per&s;picuous and original: his &s;tyle in con|ver&s;ation had an uncommon ze&s;t, which while it
<PB N="199" REF="028752_0201_0FDBF17D4BB8B3B0">
&s;eemed to di&s;dain ornament, was uncon&s;ciou&s;ly in|ter&s;per&s;ed with the bolde&s;t figures; and often wan|dered into all the vehemence of oratory, while it affected to be blunt, &s;imple, and abrupt. Nor was the part I &s;u&s;tained upon the&s;e occa&s;ions with|out its recommendations. I received the commu|nications of my friend with an ingenuous and un|prejudiced mind. If I objected to any of his views, my objections were not drawn from the &s;tores of common place, and had therefore the grace of novelty. And I may venture to &s;ay that my objections depended more for effect upon their inherent value, than upon any po&s;itivene&s;s and pa|rade with which they were announced.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland was de&s;tined to be for ever un|happy; and it &s;eemed as if no new incident could occur from which he was not able to extract food for this imperious propen&s;ity. He was wearied with a perpetual repetition of &s;imilar impre&s;&s;ions, and entertained an invincible di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t all that was new. The vi&s;it of Mr. Fore&s;ter he regarded with antipathy. He was &s;carcely able to look at him without &s;huddering; an emotion which his gue&s;t perceived, and pitied as the re&s;ult of habit and di&s;ea&s;e rather than of judgment. None of his actions pa&s;&s;ed unremarked; the mo&s;t indifferent excited unea&s;ine&s;s and apprehen&s;ion. No &s;ooner had the fir&s;t overtures of a &s;ort of intimacy be|tween me and Mr. Fore&s;ter taken place, than they probably gave birth to &s;entiments of jealou&s;y in the mind of my ma&s;ter. It was not long before he intimated to me that it would not be agreeable to him that there &s;hould be too much intercour&s;e be|tween me and his vi&s;itor.</P>
<P>What could I do? Young as I was, could it be expected that I &s;hould play the philo&s;opher, and put a perpetual curb upon my inclinations? Im|prudent though I had been, could I voluntarily
<PB N="200" REF="028752_0202_0FDBF14CCA091398">
&s;ubject my&s;elf to an eternal penance, and e&s;trange|ment from human &s;ociety? Could I di&s;courage a frankne&s;s &s;o perfectly in con&s;onance with my wi&s;hes, and receive in an ungracious way a kind|ne&s;s that &s;tole away my heart?</P>
<P>Be&s;ide this, I was but ill prepared for the &s;ervile &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion Mr. Falkland demanded. In early life I was accu&s;tomed to be much my own ma&s;ter. When I fir&s;t entered into Mr. Falkland's &s;ervice, my per&s;onal habits were checked by the novelty of my &s;ituation, and my affections were gained by the high accompli&s;hments of my patron. To novelty and its influence, curio&s;ity had immediately &s;uc|ceeded. Curio&s;ity, &s;o long as it la&s;ted, was a prin|ciple &s;tronger in my bo&s;om than even the love of independence. To that I would have &s;acrificed my liberty or my life; I would have &s;ubmitted to the condition of a We&s;t Indian Negro, or to the tortures inflicted by North American &s;avages. But the turbulence of curio&s;ity had now &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>As long as the threats of Mr. Falkland had been confined to generals, I endured it. I was con&s;ci|ous of the unbecoming action I had committed, and this rendered me humble. But, when he went farther, and undertook to pre&s;cribe to every article of my conduct, my patience was at an end. He &s;tretched his power beyond the limits of policy and prudence, and thus brought its very exi&s;tence into que&s;tion. I believed that nothing which his rage irritated by the mo&s;t open rebellion could inflict, would be wor&s;e than the &s;lavery he now pretended to impo&s;e. I had been adventurous in the gratifi|cation of an infantine and unrea&s;onable curio&s;ity, and I was re&s;olved not to be le&s;s adventurous, if need were, in the defence of every thing that can make life a ble&s;&s;ing. I was prepared for an amica|ble adju&s;tment of intere&s;ts; I would undertake that Mr. Falkland &s;hould never &s;u&s;tain injury through
<PB N="201" REF="028752_0203_0FDBF17E95821A80">
my means; but I expected in return that I &s;hould &s;uffer no incroachment, but be le&s;t to the direction of my own under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>I went on then to &s;eek Mr. Fore&s;ter's &s;ociety with eagerne&s;s; and it is the nature of an inter|cour&s;e that does not decline, progre&s;&s;ively to in|crea&s;e. Mr. Falkland ob&s;erved the&s;e &s;ymptoms with vi&s;ible perturbation. Whenever I was con|&s;cious of their being perceived by him, I betrayed tokens of confu&s;ion; this did not tend to allay his unea&s;ine&s;s. One day he drew me a&s;ide; and, with a look of my&s;terious, but terrible import, addre&s;&s;|ed me thus:</P>
<P>Young man, take warning! Perhaps this is the la&s;t time you &s;hall have an opportunity to take it! I will not always be the butt of your &s;implicity and inexperience, nor &s;uffer your weakne&s;s to triumph over my &s;trength! Why do you trifle with me? You little &s;u&s;pect the extent of my power. At this moment you are &s;urrounded with the engines of my vengeance, and before you are aware they will clo&s;e upon you. You might as well think of e&s;caping from the reach of the omnipre&s;ent God, as from mine! If you could touch &s;o much as my finger, you &s;hould expiate it in hours and months and years of a tor|ment of which as yet you have not the remote&s;t idea! Remember! I am not talking at random! I do not utter a word, that, if you provoke me, &s;hall not be executed to the &s;evere&s;t letter!</P>
<P>It may be &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e menaces were not without their effect. I withdrew in &s;ilence. My whole &s;oul revolted again&s;t the treatment I endur|ed, and yet I could not utter a word. Why could not I &s;peak the expo&s;tulations of my heart, or pro|po&s;e the compromi&s;e I meditated? It was inex|perience, and not want of &s;trength, that awed me. Every act of Mr. Falkland contained &s;ome|thing of new, and I was unprepared to meet it.
<PB N="202" REF="028752_0204_0FDBF14DD1180D88">
Perhaps it will be found that the greate&s;t hero owes the propriety of his conduct to the habit of encoun|tering difficulties and calling out with promptne&s;s the energies of his mind.</P>
<P>I contemplated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he proceedings of my ma&s;ter with the deepe&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment. Humanity and ge|neral kindne&s;s were fundamental parts of his cha|racter, but in relation to me they were &s;terile and inactive. His own intere&s;t required that he &s;hould purcha&s;e my kindne&s;s; but he preferred to govern me by terror, and watch me with uncea&s;ing anxie|ty. I ruminated with the mo&s;t mournful &s;en&s;a|tions upon the nature of my calamity. I believed that no human being was ever placed in a &s;ituation &s;o pitiable as mine. Every atom of my frame &s;eemed to have a &s;everal exi&s;tence, and to crawl within me. I had but too much rea&s;on indeed to believe that Mr. Falkland's were not empty words. I knew his ability; I felt his a&s;cendancy. If I en|countered him, what chance had I of victory? If I were defeated, what was the penalty I had to &s;uffer? Well then, the re&s;t of my life mu&s;t be de|voted to &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubjection? Mi&s;erable &s;entence! And, if it were, what &s;ecurity have I again&s;t the inju&s;tice of a man, vigilant, capricious and crimi|nal? I envied the condemned wretch upon the &s;caffold. I envied the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the inqui&s;ition in the mid&s;t of his torture. They know what they have to &s;uffer. I have only to imagine every thing terrible, and then &s;ay, The fate re&s;erved for me is wor&s;e than this!</P>
<P>It was well for me that the&s;e &s;en&s;ations were but tran&s;ient: human nature could not long &s;upport it|&s;elf under what I then felt. By degrees my mind &s;hook off its burthen. Indignation &s;ucceeded to emotions of terror. The ho&s;tility of Mr. Falkland excited ho&s;tility in me. I was determined I would never calumniate him in matters of the mo&s;t trivial

import; much le&s;s betray the grand &s;ecret upon which every thing dear to him depended. But, to|tally abjuring the offen&s;ive, I re&s;olved to &s;tand firmly upon the defen&s;ive. The liberty of acting as I plea&s;ed I would pre&s;erve at whatever ri&s;que. If I were wor&s;ted in the conte&s;t, I would at lea&s;t have the con&s;olation of reflecting that I had exerted my&s;elf with energy. In proportion as I thus de|termined, I drew off my forces from petty incur|&s;ions, and felt the propriety of acting with preme|ditation and &s;y&s;tem. I ruminated ince&s;&s;antly upon plans of deliverance, but I was anxious that my choice &s;hould not be precipitately made.</P>
<P>It was during this period of my deliberation and uncertainty that Mr. Fore&s;ter terminated his vi&s;it. He ob&s;erved a &s;trange di&s;tance in my behaviour, and in his good-natured, encouraging way chid me for it. I could only an&s;wer with a gloomy look of my&s;terious import, and a mournful and expre&s;&s;ive &s;ilence. He &s;ought me for an explanation, but I was now as ingenious in avoiding, as I had before been ardent to &s;eek him; and he quitted our hou&s;e, as he afterwards told me, with an impre&s;&s;ion, that there was &s;ome ill de&s;tiny that hung over it, that &s;eemed fated to make all its inhabitants mi&s;er|able, without its being po&s;&s;ible for a by-&s;tander to penetrate the rea&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Fore&s;ter had left us about three weeks, when Mr. Falkland &s;ent me upon &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to an e&s;tate he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a neighbouring county about fifty miles from his principal re&s;idence. The road led in a direction wholly wide of the habita|tion of our late vi&s;itor. I was upon my return from the place to which I had been &s;ent, when I began in fancy to take a &s;urvey of the various cir|cum&s;tances of my condition, and by degrees lo&s;t in the profoundne&s;s of my contemplation all atten|tion to the &s;urrounding objects. The fir&s;t deter|mination of my mind was to e&s;cape from the lynx-eyed jealou&s;y and de&s;poti&s;m of Mr. Falkland; the &s;econd to provide, by every effort of prudence and deliberation I could devi&s;e, again&s;t the danger with which I well knew my attempt mu&s;t be accompa|nied.</P>
<P>Occupied with the&s;e meditations, I rode many miles before I perceived that I had totally deviated from the right path. At length I rou&s;ed my&s;elf, and &s;urveyed the horizon round me; but I could ob&s;erve nothing with which my organ was previ|ou&s;ly acquainted. On three &s;ides the heath &s;tretched as far as the eye could reach; on the fourth I di&s;covered at &s;ome di&s;tance a wood of no ordinary dimen&s;ions. Before me &s;carcely a &s;ingle track could be found to mark that any human being had ever vi&s;ited the &s;pot. As the be&s;t expedient I could devi&s;e, I bent my cour&s;e towards the wood I have mentioned, and then pur&s;ued as well as I
<PB N="205" REF="028752_0207_0FDBF184970858D8">
was able the windings of the inclo&s;ure. This led me after &s;ome time to the end of the heath, but I was &s;till as much at a lo&s;s as ever re&s;pecting the road I &s;hould pur&s;ue. The &s;un was hid from me by a grey and cloudy atmo&s;phere; I was induced to continue along the &s;kirts of the wood, and &s;ur|mounted with &s;ome difficulty the hedges and other ob&s;tacles that from time to time pre&s;ented them|&s;elves. My thoughts were gloomy and di&s;con&s;o|late; the drearine&s;s of the day and the &s;olitude which &s;urrounded me &s;eemed to communicate a &s;adne&s;s to my &s;oul. I had proceeded a con&s;iderable way, and was quite overcome with hunger and fa|tigue, when I di&s;covered a road and a little inn at no great di&s;tance. I made up to them, and upon enquiry found that, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing the proper direction, I had taken one that led to Mr. Fo|re&s;ter's, rather than to my own habitation. I alighted, and was entering the hou&s;e, when the appearance of that gentleman &s;truck my eyes.</P>
<P>Mr. Fore&s;ter acco&s;ted me with kindne&s;s, invited me into the room where he had been &s;itting, and enquired what accident had brought me to that place. While he was &s;peaking, I could not help recollecting the extraordinary manner in which we were thus once more brought together, and a train of ideas was by this means &s;ugge&s;ted to my mind. Some refre&s;hment was by Mr. Fore&s;ter's order pre|pared for me; I &s;at down and partook of it. Still this thought dwelt upon my recollection:&mdash;Mr. Falkland would never be made acquainted with our meeting; I had an opportunity thrown in my way, which if I did not improve, I &s;hould de&s;erve all the con&s;equences that might re&s;ult. I could now conver&s;e with a friend, and a powerful friend, without fear of being watched and overlooked. What wonder that I was tempted to di&s;clo&s;e, not Mr. Falkland's &s;ecret, but my own &s;ituation, and
<PB N="206" REF="028752_0208_0FDBF150D13A3B88">
receive the advice of a man of worth and experi|ence, which might perhaps be adequately done without entering into any detail injurious to my ma&s;ter?</P>
<P>Mr. Fore&s;ter was forward on his part, to learn why it was that I thought my&s;elf unhappy, and why I had avoided him during the latter part of his re&s;idence under the &s;ame roof, as evidently as I had before taken plea&s;ure in his communications. I told him that I could give him but an imper|fect &s;atisfaction upon the&s;e points, but what I could I would willingly explain. The fact, I pro|ceeded, was, that there were certain rea&s;ons which rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for me to have a tranquil moment under the roof of Mr. Falkland. I had revolved the matter again and again in my mind, and was finally convinced that I owed it to my|&s;elf to withdraw from his &s;ervice. I added, that I was &s;en&s;ible by this half confidence I might ra|ther &s;eem to merit the di&s;approbation of Mr. Fo|re&s;ter than his countenance; but I declared my per&s;ua&s;ion that, if he could be acquainted with the whole affair, however &s;trange my behaviour might at pre&s;ent appear, he would applaud my re|&s;erve.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked what rea&s;on I had to complain of Mr. Falkland? I replied, that I entertained the deepe&s;t reverence for my ma&s;ter; I admired his abilities, and con&s;idered him as formed for the be|nefit of his &s;pecies. I &s;hould in my own opi|nion be the vile&s;t of mi&s;creants, if I uttered a whi&s;per to his di&s;advantage. But all this did not avail: I was not fit for him; perhaps I was not good enough for him; at all events I mu&s;t be perpetually mi&s;erable &s;o long as I continued to live with him.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved Mr. Fore&s;ter gaze upon me eagerly with curio&s;ity and &s;urpri&s;e, but this circum&s;tance I
<PB N="207" REF="028752_0209_0FDBF1861C33F0B0">
did not think proper to notice. Having recovered him&s;elf, he a&s;ked, Why then, that being the ca&s;e, I did not quit his &s;ervice? I an&s;wered, What he now touched upon was that which mo&s;t of all con|tributed to my misfortune. Mr. Falkland was not ignorant of my di&s;like to my pre&s;ent &s;ituation; per|haps he thought it unrea&s;onable, unju&s;t; but I knew that he would never be brought to con&s;ent to my giving way to it.</P>
<P>Here Mr. Fore&s;ter interrupted me: and, &s;miling, &s;aid, I magnified ob&s;tacles, and overrated my own importance, adding that he would undertake to re|move that difficulty, as well as to provide me with a more agreeable appointment. This &s;ugge&s;tion produced in me a &s;erious alarm. I replied, that I mu&s;t intreat him upon no account to think of ap|plying to Mr. Falkland upon the &s;ubject. I added, that perhaps I was only betraying my own imbeci|lity; but in reality, unacquainted as I was with experience and the world, I was afraid, though di&s;gu&s;ted with my pre&s;ent re&s;idence, to expo&s;e my|&s;elf upon a mere project of my own, to the re&s;ent|ment of &s;o con&s;iderable a man as Mr. Falkland, If he would favour me with his advice upon the &s;ubject, or if he would only give me leave to hope for his protection in ca&s;e of any unfore&s;een ac|cident, this was all I pre&s;umed to reque&s;t; and, thus encouraged, I would venture to obey the dic|tates of my inclination, and fly in pur&s;uit of my lo&s;t tranquillity.</P>
<P>Having thus opened my&s;elf to this generous friend as far as I could do it with propriety and &s;afety, he &s;at for &s;ome time &s;ilent with an air of deep reflection. At length with a countenance of unu&s;ual &s;everity he thus addre&s;&s;ed me: Young man, I am afraid you are ignorant of the nature of the tale you have been telling me. There is my&s;|tery in it; there is &s;omething you cannot prevail
<PB N="208" REF="028752_0210_0FDBF154573DB8E8">
upon your&s;elf to di&s;clo&s;e. My&s;tery always implies &s;omewhere or other an uncommon portion of wrong; what am I to think of you? Are you aware of the prejudice you are voluntarily creating again&s;t your&s;elf thus upon the thre&s;hold of life?</P>
<P>I an&s;wered that, whatever were the amount of that prejudice, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit. I placed my hope of a candid con&s;truction in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, in the rectitude of his nature.</P>
<P>He went on: Well, be it as you plea&s;e. It was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould tell you what you were doing. I am in &s;ome re&s;pects the wor&s;t per&s;on you could have applied to under the&s;e circum|&s;tances. I am the idolator of frankne&s;s, and have an unconquerable abhorrence to every thing that is the rever&s;e of it. If any body had told me &s;ix months ago that I could have been brought to coun|tenance a per&s;on that practi&s;ed that rever&s;e, I &s;hould not have believed him. But I will tell you fairly the &s;tate of my mind. Your conduct in this re|&s;pect has not, as yet at lea&s;t; de&s;troyed the early predilection I conceived in your favour. The ba|lance, &s;o far as I am able at pre&s;ent to adju&s;t it, is with you. I will therefore, though in total oppo|&s;ition to my principles, yield to this in&s;tigation. I put my&s;elf into your hands; I will do exactly what you require. I will receive you either now or hereafter under my own roof, tru&s;ting that you will not deceive my confidence, and that I &s;hall find unfavourable appearances ultimately terminat|ing as the man mo&s;t &s;olicitous for your welfare would de&s;ire.</P>
<P>We were engaged in the earne&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of &s;ubjects thus intere&s;ting to my peace, when we were interrupted by an event of all others the mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly to be deprecated. Without the &s;malle&s;t notice, and as if he had dropped upon us from the clouds, Mr. Falkland bur&s;t into the room. I found
<PB N="209" REF="028752_0211_0FDBF18AD7D950F0">
afterwards that Mr. Fore&s;ter had come thus far upon an appointment to meet Mr. Falkland, and that the place of their intended rendezvous was the next &s;tage. Mr. Fore&s;ter was detained unex|pectedly at the inn where we now were, by our accidental rencounter, and in reality had for the moment forgotten his appointment; while Mr. Falkland, not finding him where he expected, had proceeded thus far towards the hou&s;e of his kin&s;|man. To me the meeting was the mo&s;t unac|countable in the world.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly fore&s;aw the dreadful complication of misfortune that was included in this event. To Mr. Falkland the meeting between me and his re|lation mu&s;t appear, not accidental, but concerted. I was totally out of the road I had been travelling by his direction; I was in a road that led directly to the hou&s;e of Mr. Fore&s;ter. What mu&s;t he think of this? How mu&s;t he &s;uppo&s;e I came to that place? The truth, if told, that I came there with|out de&s;ign, and purely in con&s;equence of having lo&s;t my way, mu&s;t appear to be the mo&s;t impudent lie that ever was devi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Here then I &s;tood detected in the fact of that intercour&s;e which had been &s;o &s;everely forbidden. But in this in&s;tance it was infinitely wor&s;e, than in tho&s;e which had already given &s;o much di&s;turbance to Mr. Falkland. It was then open, frank and unconcealed; and therefore the pre&s;umption was that it was for purpo&s;es that required no conceal|ment. But the pre&s;ent interview, if concerted, was in the mo&s;t emphatical degree clande&s;tine. Nor was it le&s;s perilous than it was clande&s;tine. It had been forbidden with the mo&s;t dreadful menaces, and Mr. Falkland was not ignorant how deep an impre&s;&s;ion tho&s;e menaces had made upon my ima|gination. Such a meeting therefore could not have been concerted under &s;uch circum&s;tances for a tri|vial
<PB N="210" REF="028752_0212_0FDBF155546A3A10">
purpo&s;e, or for any purpo&s;e that his heart did not quake to think of. Such was the amount of my crime; &s;uch was the agony my appearance was calculated to in&s;pire; and it was rea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e that the penalty I had to expect would be pro|portionable. The threats of Mr. Falkland &s;till &s;ounded in my ears, and I was in a tran&s;port of terror.</P>
<P>The conduct of the &s;ame man in different cir|cum&s;tances is often &s;o various as to render it very difficult to be accounted for&punc; Mr. Falkland, in this to him terrible cri&s;is, did not &s;eem to be in any de|gree hurried away by his pa&s;&s;ions. For a moment he was dumb, his eyes glared with a&s;toni&s;hment; and the next moment as it were, he had the mo&s;t perfect calmne&s;s and &s;elf-command. Had it been otherwi&s;e I have no doubt that I &s;hould in&s;tantly have entered into an explanation, the ingenuou&s;|ne&s;s and con&s;i&s;tency of which could not but have been in &s;ome degree attended with a favourable event. But as it was, I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be over|come; I yielded as in a former in&s;tance to the di&s;|comfiting influence of &s;urpri&s;e. I dared &s;carcely breathe; I ob&s;erved the appearances with anxiety and wonder. Mr. Falkland quietly ordered me to return home, and take along with me the groom he had brought with him. I obeyed in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>I afterwards under&s;tood that he enquired mi|nutely of Mr. Fore&s;ter the circum&s;tances of our meeting, and that that gentleman, perceiving that the meeting it&s;elf was di&s;covered, and guided by ha|bits of frankne&s;s, which, when once rooted in a character, it is very difficult to counteract, told Mr. Falkland every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed, together with the remarks it had &s;ugge&s;ted to his own mind. Mr. Falkland received the communication with an ambiguous and &s;tudied &s;ilence, which by no means operated to my advantage in the already-poi&s;oned
<PB N="211" REF="028752_0213_0FDBF18D93EAD4C8">
mind of Mr. Fore&s;ter. His &s;ilence was partly the direct con&s;equence of a mind watchful, inqui&s;itive and doubting; and partly perhaps was adopted for the &s;ake of the effect it was qualified to produce, Mr. Falkland not being unwilling to encourage a prejudice again&s;t the character of a per&s;on who might one day become the adver&s;ary of his own.</P>
<P>As to me, I went home indeed, for this was not a moment to re&s;i&s;t. Mr. Falkland, with a preme|ditation to which he had artfully given the appear|ance of accident, had taken care to &s;end with me a guard to attend upon his pri&s;oner. I &s;eemed as if conducting to one of tho&s;e fortre&s;&s;es, famed in the hi&s;tory of de&s;poti&s;m, from which the wretched victim is never known to e&s;cape; and, when I en|tered my chamber, I felt as if I were entering a dungeon. I reflected that I was at the mercy of a man, exa&s;perated at my di&s;obedience, and who was already formed to cruelty by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive murders. I had occa&s;ionally indulged in vi&s;ions of plea&s;ure, authority and honour as the attendants of my ma|turer years: who has not? e&s;pecially who, with an imagination as bu&s;y and a &s;pirit as ardent as mine? All the&s;e pro&s;pects were now clo&s;ed; I was cut off for ever from pur&s;uits that I had meditated with ineffable delight; my death might be the event of a few hours. I was a victim at the &s;hrine of con|&s;cious guilt that knew neither re&s;t nor &s;atiety; I &s;hould be blotted from the catalogue of the living, and my fate remain eternally a &s;ecret; the man who added my murder to his former crimes, would &s;how him&s;elf the next morning, and be hailed with the admiration and applau&s;e of his &s;pecies.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e terrible imaginations one idea pre&s;ented it&s;elf that alleviated my feelings. This was the recollection of the &s;trange and un|accountable tranquillity which Mr. Falkland had
<PB N="212" REF="028752_0214_0FDBF156DF313EA8">
manife&s;ted, when he di&s;covered me in company with Mr. Fore&s;ter. I was not deceived by this. I knew full well that this calm was temporary, and would be &s;ucceeded by a tumult and whirlwind of the pa&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t dreadful &s;ort. But a man under the power of &s;uch terrors as now occupied me, catches at every reed. I &s;aid to my&s;elf, that this tranquil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ity was a period it was incumbent upon me to improve; and the &s;horter its duration might be found, the more &s;peedy was I obliged to be in the u&s;e of it. I could not endure the thought that the apprehen&s;ions I now entertained, &s;hould be reali&s;ed through the neglect of any exer|tion or even daring on my part. In a word, I took the re&s;olution, becau&s;e I already &s;tood in fear of the vengeance of Mr. Falkland, to ri&s;que the po&s;&s;ibility of provoking it in a degree &s;till more inexpiable, and terminate at once my pre&s;ent &s;tate of uncertainty. Add to which, I had now opened my ca&s;e to Mr. Fore&s;ter, and he had given me po&s;i|tive a&s;&s;urances of his protection. This in the pre|&s;ent de&s;peration of my fortune was an idea to which my mind willingly had recour&s;e for &s;upport and con&s;olation.&mdash;In&s;tigated by the&s;e reflections, I &s;at down to addre&s;s the following letter to Mr. Falkland.</P>

<P>Such was my employment of the evening of a day, which will be ever memorable in the hi&s;tory of my life. Mr. Falkland not being yet returned, though expected every hour, I was induced to make u&s;e of the pretext of fatigue to avoid an in|terview. I went to bed. The next morning I was informed, that he did not come home till late, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad enquired for me, and being told that I was in bed, had &s;aid nothing farther upon the &s;ubject. Satisfied in this re&s;pect, I went to the breakfa&s;ting parlour, and bu&s;ied my&s;elf for &s;ome time in arrang|ing a few books and &s;ome other little occupations, till Mr. Falkland &s;hould appear. After a little time I heard his &s;tep, which I perfectly knew how to di&s;tingui&s;h, in the pa&s;&s;age. Pre&s;ently, he &s;topped, and, &s;peaking to &s;ome one in a &s;ort of deliberate, but &s;mothered voice, I overheard him repeat my
<PB N="214" REF="028752_0216_0FDBF15D9257FBE0">
name as enquiring for me. In conformity to the plan I had per&s;uaded my&s;elf to adopt, I now laid the letter I had written upon the table, near where he u&s;ually &s;at, and made my exit at one door as Mr. Falkland entered at the other. This done, I withdrew in expectation of the event to a private apartment, a &s;ort of light-clo&s;et at the end of the library, where I was accu&s;tomed not unfrequently to &s;it.</P>
<P>I had not been here three minutes when I heard the voice of Mr. Falkland calling me. I went to him in the library. That is your letter, &s;aid he, throwing it. His manner was that of a man la|bouring with &s;ome dreadful thought, and endea|vouring to give an air of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibi|lity to his behaviour. I think no carriage of any other &s;ort could have produced a &s;en&s;ation of &s;uch inexplicable horror, or have excited in the per&s;on who was mo&s;t immediately its object, &s;uch an alarm for the event.</P>
<P>My lad, continued he, I believe now you have played almo&s;t all your tricks, and, damn me, if the farce be not nearly at an end! With your api&s;h|ne&s;s and ab&s;urdity however you have taught me one thing, and, whereas before now I have winced at them with torture, I am now as tough as an elephant. I &s;hall cru&s;h you in the end with the &s;ame indifference that I would any other little in&s;ect that di&s;turbed my &s;erenity.</P>
<P>I believe you have decided your fate. I think my&s;elf &s;ure that you will never have done till you have brought my whole weight upon you. You may try however. Your only chance is in pa&s;&s;ive|ne&s;s. I am now perfectly in&s;en&s;ible to every thing you can &s;uffer, but I have no plea&s;ure in it. I will let you alone, if I can.</P>

I am unable to tell what brought about your meeting with Mr. Fore&s;ter ye&s;terday. It might be de&s;ign; it might be accident. But, be it which it will, I &s;hall not forget it.

The very next time you di&s;obey me in that or any other ar|ticle, there is an end of your vagaries for ever. Perhaps your &s;ituation may be a pitiable one; it is for you to look to that. I only know that it is in your power to prevent its growing wor&s;e; no time nor chance &s;hall ever make it better.</P>
<P>Do not imagine I am afraid of you! I wear an armour, again&s;t which all your weapons are impo|tent. I have dug a pit for you; and, whichever way you move, backward or forward, to the right or to the left, it is ready to &s;wallow you. Be &s;till! If once you fall, call as loud as you will, no man on earth &s;hall hear your cries; prepare a tale ever &s;o plau&s;ible, or ever &s;o true, the whole world &s;hall execrate you as an impo&s;tor. Your innocence &s;hall be of no &s;ervice to you; I laugh at &s;o feeble a defence. It is I that &s;ay it; you may believe what I tell you. Do you not know, mi&s;erable wretch! added he, &s;uddenly altering his tone, and &s;tamping upon the ground with fury, that I have &s;worn to pre&s;erve my reputation at whatever ex|pence, that I love it more than the whole world and its inhabitants taken together? And do you think that you &s;hall wound it? Begone, mi&s;creant! reptile! and cea&s;e to contend with un&s;urmountable power!</P>
<P>The part of my hi&s;tory which I am now relating is that which I reflect upon with the lea&s;t compla|cency.
<PB N="216" REF="028752_0218_0FDBF15D9445C608">
Why was it that I was once more totally overcome by the imperious carriage of Mr. Falk|land, and unable to utter a word? The reader will be pre&s;ented with many occa&s;ions in the &s;equel in which I wanted neither facility in the invention of expedients, nor fortitude in entering upon my ju&s;tification. Per&s;ecution at length gave firmne&s;s to my character, and taught me the better part of manhood. But in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance I was irre|&s;olute, overawed and aba&s;hed.</P>
<P>The &s;peech I had heard was the dictate of frenzy, and it created in me a &s;imilar frenzy. It deter|mined me to do the very thing again&s;t which I was thus &s;olemnly warned, and fly from my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e. I could not enter into parley with him; I could no longer endure the vile &s;ubjugation he im|po&s;ed on me. It was in vain that my rea&s;on came to my aid, and warned me of the ra&s;hne&s;s of a mea&s;ure to be taken without concert or preparation. I &s;eemed to be in a &s;tate in which rea&s;on had no power. I felt as if I could coolly &s;urvey the &s;everal arguments of the ca&s;e, perceive that they had pru|dence, truth and common &s;en&s;e on their &s;ide: and then an&s;wer, I am under the guidance of a direc|tor more energetic than you.</P>
<P>I was not long in executing what I had thus ra|pidly determined. I fixed on the evening of that very day as the period of my eva&s;ion. Even in this &s;hort interval I had perhaps &s;ufficient time for de|liberation. But all opportunity was u&s;ele&s;s to me; my mind was fixed, and each &s;ucceeding moment only increa&s;ed the un&s;peakable eagerne&s;s with which I meditated my e&s;cape. The hours u&s;ually ob&s;erved by our family in this country re&s;idence were regular; and one in the morning was the time I &s;elected for my undertaking. I &s;tole down quietly from my chamber with a lamp in my hand;
<PB N="217" REF="028752_0219_0FDBF192D122FA68">
I went along a pa&s;&s;age that led to a &s;mall door opening into the garden, and then cro&s;&s;ed the gar|den to a gate that inter&s;ected an elm walk and a private hor&s;e-path on the out&s;ide.</P>
<P>I could &s;carcely believe my good-fortune in hav|ing thus far executed my de&s;ign without interrup|tion. The terrible images Mr. Falkland's menaces had &s;ugge&s;ted to my mind, made me expect impe|diment and detection at every &s;tep, though the im|pa&s;&s;ioned &s;tate of my mind impelled me to advance with de&s;perate re&s;olution. I drew a favourable omen as to the final re&s;ult of my project, from the de&s;irable event which had attended me in the out&s;et.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t plan that had &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf to me was, to go to the neare&s;t public road, and take the earlie&s;t &s;tage for London. There I believed I &s;hould be mo&s;t &s;afe from di&s;covery, if the venge|ance of Mr. Falkland &s;hould prompt him to pur&s;ue me; and I did not doubt, among the multiplied re&s;ources of the metropolis, to find &s;omething which &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t to me an eligible mode of di&s;po&s;ing of my per&s;on and indu&s;try. I re&s;erved Mr. Fore&s;|ter in my arrangement as a la&s;t re&s;ource, not to be called forth unle&s;s for immediate protection from the hand of per&s;ecution and power.</P>
<P>The mode of my proceeding being thus far di|ge&s;ted, I traced with a chearful heart the unfre|quented path it was now nece&s;&s;ary for me to pur|&s;ue. The night was gloomy, and it drizzled with rain. But the&s;e were circum&s;tances I had &s;carcely the power to perceive; all was &s;un&s;hine and joy within me. I hardly felt the ground; I repeated to my&s;elf a thou&s;and times, I am free. What con|cern have I with danger and alarm; I feel that I am free; I feel that I will continue &s;o. What power is able to hold in chains a mind ardent and deter|mined? What power can cau&s;e that man to die, who&s;e whole &s;oul commands him to continue to live? I looked back with abhorrence to the &s;ub|jection in which I had been held. I did not hate the author of my misfortunes; truth and ju&s;tice acquit me of that; I rather pitied the hard de&s;tiny
<PB N="219" REF="028752_0221_0FDBF199C83E65B8">
to which he &s;eemed condemned. But I thought with un&s;peakable loathing of tho&s;e errors, in con|&s;equence of which every man is fated to be more or le&s;s the tyrant or the &s;lave. I was a&s;toni&s;hed at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olly of my &s;pecies, that they did not ri&s;e up as one man, and &s;hake off chains &s;o ignominious and mi&s;ery &s;o in&s;upportable. So far as related to my|&s;elf, I re&s;olved, and this re&s;olution has never been entirely forgotten by me, to hold my&s;elf di&s;engaged from the odious &s;cene, and never fill the part either of the oppre&s;&s;or or the &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>My mind continued in this enthu&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, full of confidence, and acce&s;&s;ible only to &s;uch a portion of &s;ear as &s;erved rather to keep up a &s;tate of plea&s;urable emotion, than to generate angui&s;h and di&s;tre&s;s, during the whole of this nocturnal expedition. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ter a walk of three hours I arrived without accident at the village from which I hoped to have taken my pa&s;&s;age for the metropolis. At this early hour every thing was quiet; no found of any thing human &s;aluted my ear. It was with difficulty that I gained admittance into the yard of the inn, where I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound a &s;ingle o&s;tler taking care of &s;ome hor&s;es. From him I received the unwelcome tidings that the coach was not expected till &s;ix o'clock in the morning of the following day, its route through that town recurring only three times a-week.</P>
<P>This intelligence gave the fir&s;t check to the rap|turous inebriation by which my mind had been po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed from the moment I quitted the habitation of Mr. Falkland. The whole of my fortune in ready ca&s;h con&s;i&s;ted of about eleven guineas. I had about fifty more that had fallen to me from the di&s;po&s;al of my property at the death of my father; but that was &s;o ve&s;ted as to preclude it from immediate u&s;e, and I even doubted whether it would not be found
<PB N="220" REF="028752_0222_0FDBF16514421C88">
better ultimately to re&s;ign it, than by claiming it to ri&s;k the furni&s;hing a clue to what I mo&s;t of all dreaded to incur, the per&s;ecution of Mr. Falkland. There was nothing I &s;o ardently de&s;ired as the an|nihilation of all future intercour&s;e between us, that he &s;hould not know there was &s;uch a per&s;on on the earth as my&s;elf, and that I &s;hould never more hear the name of my quondam ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, I conceived frugality to be an object by no means unworthy of my attention, unable as I was to progno&s;ticate what di&s;courage|ments and delays might pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the accompli&s;hment of my wi&s;hes, after my arrival in London. For this and other rea&s;ons I determined to adhere to my de&s;ign of travelling by the &s;tage; it only remaining for me to con&s;ider in what manner I &s;hould prevent the eventual delay of twenty-four hours from becoming by any untoward event a &s;ource of new calamity. It was by no means ad|vi&s;able to remain at the village where I now was, during this interval; nor did I even think it proper to employ it in proceeding on foot along the great road. I therefore decided upon making a circuit, the direction of which &s;hould &s;eem at fir&s;t extremely wide of my intended route, and then &s;uddenly &s;triking into a different path &s;hould enable me to arrive by the clo&s;e of day at a market-town twelve miles nearer to the metropolis.</P>
<P>Having fixed the economy of the day, and per|&s;uaded my&s;elf that it was the be&s;t which under the circum&s;tances could be adopted, I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for the mo&s;t part all farther anxieties from my mind, and eagerly yielded my&s;elf up to the different amu&s;e|ments that aro&s;e. I re&s;ted and went forward at the impul&s;e of the moment. At one time I reclined upon a bank immer&s;ed in contemplation, and at another exerted my&s;elf to analy&s;e the pro&s;pects
<PB N="221" REF="028752_0223_0FDBF19B109193C0">
which &s;ucceeded each other. The hazine&s;s of the morning was followed by a &s;pirit-&s;tirring and beautiful day. With the ductility &s;o characteri&s;tic of a youthful mind, I forgot the angui&s;h which had lately been my continual gue&s;t, and occu|pied my&s;elf entirely in dreams of future no|velty and felicity. I &s;carcely ever in the whole cour&s;e of my exi&s;tence &s;pent a day of more various or exqui&s;ite gratification. It furni&s;hed a &s;trong and perhaps not an un&s;alutary contra&s;t to the ter|rors which had preceded, and the dreadful &s;cenes that awaited me.</P>
<P>In the evening I arrived at the place of my de&s;|tination, enquired for the inn at which the coach was accu&s;tomed to call, and ordered my&s;elf refre&s;h|ment and a bed. I had not been long here, before, having occa&s;ion to cro&s;s the inn yard upon &s;ome oc|ca&s;ion, ju&s;t as I was going again to enter the hou&s;e I &s;aw one of Mr. Falkland's footmen riding into the gate-way. I had no doubt that I was my&s;elf the object of his journey. But it was too late to think of avoiding his ob&s;ervation; he was almo&s;t upon me before I &s;aw him. Every incident con|nected with my late abhorred &s;ituation was calcu|lated to impre&s;s me with the deepe&s;t alarm. My fir&s;t thought was to betake my&s;elf to the fields, and tru&s;t to the &s;wiftne&s;s of my flight for &s;afety. But I pre&s;ently remarked that he was alone; and I be|lieved that it would be di&s;graceful to fly, when, man to man, I might rea&s;onably hope I could at any time get the better, either by the firmne&s;s of my deter|mination, or the &s;ubtlety of my invention.</P>
<P>Thus determined, I came up to him as he alight|ed from his hor&s;e and bade him follow into the room where I had been &s;itting. Well, Thomas, &s;aid I, I gue&s;s your errand; but it is to no purpo&s;e. You come to conduct me back to Falkland Hou&s;e; but no force &s;hall ever drag me to that place alive. I
<PB N="222" REF="028752_0224_0FDBF16B9AFDCA40">
have not taken my re&s;olution without great con&s;i|deration and &s;trong rea&s;ons; and, having taken it, all the world &s;hall never per&s;uade me to alter. I am an Engli&s;hman; and it is the privilege of an Engli&s;hman to be &s;ole judge and ma&s;ter of his own actions.</P>
<P>Why, ma&s;ter Williams, replied Thomas, to be &s;ure you &s;hould know be&s;t what you are about. We are all at a &s;tound, as a man may &s;ay, to think what you have got in your head. But that is none of my bu&s;ine&s;s. Sure enough the &s;quire expects you to go back with me; but I have a letter for you, and mayhap when you have read that, you may come off from a little of your &s;toutne&s;s. For my part I knew poor farmer Williams, your father, the&s;e many a day, and I &s;hould be main <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oth for his fake and your own too, that you &s;hould come to any &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, he gave me his letter, which was from Mr. Fore&s;ter, whom, as he told me, he had left at my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e. It was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>WILLIAMS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My brother Falkland has &s;ent his man Thomas in pur&s;uit of you. He expects that, if found, you will return with him. I expect &s;o too. It is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to your future honour and character. After reading the&s;e lines, if you are a villain and a ra&s;cal, you will perhaps endea|vour to fly. If your con&s;cience tells you, You are innocent, you will out of all doubt come back. Let me know whether I have been your dupe; and whether, while I was won over by your &s;eeming ingenuity, I was the tool of a de&s;igning knave. If you come, I pledge my&s;elf that, if you clear your reputation, you &s;hall not only be free to go wherever you plea&s;e, but &s;hall receive every a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
<PB N="223" REF="028752_0225_0FDBF19EEA628278">

<CLOSER><SIGNED>VALENTINE FORESTER.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>What a letter was this? To a mind like mine glowing with the love of virtue, &s;uch an addre&s;s was &s;trong enough to draw the per&s;on to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed from one end of the earth to the other. Pri&s;ons, racks and gibbets would have &s;hrunk into nothing in compari&s;on with it. The ideas it &s;ugge&s;ted had a tendency to fill the mind, and &s;hut out the po&s;&s;ibility of competition.</P>
<P>I repa&s;&s;ed in my thoughts every memorable in|cident that had happened to me under the roof of Mr. Falkland. I could recollect nothing, except the affair of the my&s;terious che&s;t, out of which the &s;hadow of an accu&s;ation of the nature alluded to in Mr. Fore&s;ter's letter could be extorted. In that in&s;tance no doubt my conduct had been highly reprehen&s;ible, and I had never looked back upon it without remor&s;e and &s;elf-condemnation. But I did not believe that it was of the nature of tho&s;e actions which can be brought under legal cen&s;ure. I &s;till le&s;s could per&s;uade my&s;elf to believe, that Mr. Falkland, who &s;huddered at the very po&s;&s;ibility of his own detection, and who con&s;idered him&s;elf as completely in my power, would dare to bring forward a &s;ubject &s;o clo&s;ely connected with that topic, which wakened eternal agony in his &s;oul. In a word, the more I reflected on the phra&s;es of Mr. Fore&s;ter's billet, the le&s;s could I imagine the nature of tho&s;e &s;cenes to which they were to &s;erve as a prelude.</P>
<P>The in&s;crutablene&s;s however of the my&s;tery they contained was by no means calculated to mitigate my apprehen&s;ions. It &s;erved on the contrary to give new pungency to my alarm. It overwhelmed
<PB N="224" REF="028752_0226_0FDBF16F25E27C80">
every quality of my mind; except my fortitude. What re&s;ources had not my per&s;ecutor at his com|mand? It was now that I began to fear him. All the apprehen&s;ions that had before haunted my mind &s;eemed, in compari&s;on with what I now felt, like the gambols of children. But what could I do? This was an enemy to face and not to fly. Tear me to pieces, exclaimed I, tremendous and incomprehen&s;ible genius! hang up this mi&s;erable car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;s to writhe beneath a burning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">un! inflict upon me unheard of and lingering tortures!&mdash;that in &s;ome part or other of the earth you might do! But my good name &s;hall never be your victim! I will be heard; I will be under&s;tood! All the arts of hell &s;hall not prevent that! I may be unfortu|nate; but my very per&s;ecutors &s;hall confe&s;s my in|nocence!</P>
<P>Thomas, &s;aid I, after a con&s;iderable interval &s;pent in &s;ilence, to my attendant, You are right. This is indeed a very extraordinary letter you have brought me; but it an&s;wers its purpo&s;e. I will certainly go with you now, whatever be the con|&s;equence. No per&s;on &s;hall ever be able to lay any blame to me, &s;o long as I have it in my power to clear my&s;elf. So, get ready immediately!</P>
<P>Ble&s;s us, cried Thomas, this is a &s;urpri&s;ing change indeed! But I &s;hould think, &s;ir, if you plea&s;e, that there is no need of being in &s;uch a devil of a hurry. It is now dark night, and I am woundy tired. Whatever it is you may have got in your head, I dare to &s;ay neither you nor ma&s;ter will do any thing till to-morrow.</P>
<P>To this remon&s;trance I replied, that I would willingly con&s;ent to a re&s;pite of an hour or two hours, if he de&s;ired it, but longer than that I was determined I would not wait, and, if he were not then ready, I would proceed without him. I con|ceived that, in the circum&s;tances in which I was
<PB N="225" REF="028752_0227_0FDBF1A05077C260">
placed by Mr. Fore&s;ter's letter, it became me to &s;how, not merely a willingne&s;s, but an alacrity and impatience to return. Thomas confe&s;&s;ed that it was in his orders not to part from me when I was once found, and of con&s;equence he was obliged to agree to the compromi&s;e I propo&s;ed. We pro|cured a &s;econd hor&s;e from the village. As we rode home, my mind was occupied again and again in endeavouring to account for Mr. Fore&s;ter's letter; but none of my attempts were productive of &s;atis|faction. I knew the inflexibility and &s;ternne&s;s of Mr. Falkland's mind in accompli&s;hing the purpo&s;es he had mo&s;t at heart; but I al&s;o knew that every virtuous and magnanimous principle was congenial to his character.</P>
<P>When we arrived it was &s;till dark, though the greater part of the night had already elap&s;ed. We were obliged to waken one of the &s;ervants to give us admittance. I found that Mr. Fore&s;ter had left a me&s;&s;age for me in con&s;ideration of the po&s;&s;ibility of my arrival during the night, directing me im|mediately to go to bed, and to take care that I did not come weary and exhau&s;ted to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the following day. I endeavoured to take his advice; but my &s;lumbers were unrefre&s;hing and di&s;turbed. This did not di&s;courage me; the &s;ingularity of my &s;ituation, my conjectures with re&s;pect to the pre|&s;ent, my apprehen&s;ions for the future did not allow me to think it po&s;&s;ible that I could &s;ink into a lan|guid and inactive &s;tate.</P>
<P>Next morning the fir&s;t per&s;on I &s;aw was Mr. Fore&s;ter. He told me that he did not yet know what Mr. Falkland had to allege again&s;t me, for that he had refu&s;ed to know. He had arrived at the hou&s;e of his brother by appointment on the preceding day to &s;ettle &s;ome indi&s;pen&s;able bu&s;ine&s;s, his intention having been to depart the moment the bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;hed, as he knew that conduct on
<PB N="226" REF="028752_0228_0FDBF17112932C38">
his part would be mo&s;t agreeable to Mr. Falkland. But he was no &s;ooner come than he found the whole hou&s;e in confu&s;ion, the alarm of my elope|ment having been given a little before. Mr. Falk|land had di&s;patched &s;ervants in all directions in pur&s;uit of me; and the &s;ervant from the market town arrived at the &s;ame moment with Mr. Fo|re&s;ter, with intelligence that a per&s;on an&s;wering to the de&s;cription h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> gave had been there very ear|ly in the morning enquiring re&s;pecting the &s;tage to London.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland &s;eemed extremely di&s;turbed at this information, and exclaimed upon me with great acrimony as an unthankful and unnatural villain.</P>
<P>Mr. Fore&s;ter replied: Have more command of your&s;elf, &s;ir! Villain is a very &s;erious appellation, and ought not to be trifled with. Engli&s;hmen are free; and no man ought to be charged with villai|ny becau&s;e he choo&s;es to change one &s;ource of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence for another.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland &s;hook his head, and with a &s;mile expre&s;&s;ive of acute &s;en&s;ibility &s;aid, Brother, bro|ther, you are the dupe of his art. For my part I always con&s;idered him with an eye of &s;u&s;picion, and was aware of his depravity. But I have ju&s;t di&s;covered&mdash;</P>
<P>Stop, &s;ir! interrupted Mr. Fore&s;ter. I own I thought you might be employing in a moment of acrimony har&s;h epithets without any accurate mean|ing. But, if you have any &s;erious accu&s;ation to make again&s;t Williams, let us not be told of that, till it be known whether the poor lad is within reach of a hearing. Though a ju&s;t man will chear|fully &s;uffer the ill opinion of others, he will not lightly entertain an ill opinion again&s;t them. For my part the &s;lendere&s;t allowance I can make to &s;uch as are unhappy enough to incur the dete&s;ta|tion of their &s;pecies, is that of being previou&s;ly
<PB N="227" REF="028752_0229_0FDBF1A54B201948">
heard in their own defence. It is a wi&s;e principle in Engli&s;h law that requires the judge to come into court totally uninformed of the merits of the cau&s;e he is to try; and to that principle I am determin|ed to conform as an individual. I think it right to be &s;evere and inflexible in proceeding again&s;t offen|ders, but the &s;everity I exerci&s;e in the &s;equel &s;hall always be accompanied with impartiality in the preliminary.</P>
<P>While Mr. Fore&s;ter related to me th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e parti|culars, he ob&s;erved me ready to break out into &s;ome of the expre&s;&s;ions which the narrative &s;ug|ge&s;ted, but he would not &s;uffer me to &s;peak. No, Williams, &s;aid he; I would not hear Mr. Falkland again&s;t you; neither will I hear you in your de|fence. I am come to you at pre&s;ent to &s;peak, and not to hear. I thought it became me to warn you of your danger, but I have nothing more to do now. Re&s;erve what you have to &s;ay to the proper time. Make the be&s;t &s;tory you can for your&s;elf; true, if truth, as I hope, will &s;erve your purpo&s;e; but, if not, the mo&s;t plau&s;ible and ingenious you can invent. That is an exertion which &s;elf-defence requires from every man in ca&s;es where, as it al|ways happens when a man is put upon his trial, he has the whole world again&s;t him, and has his own battle to fight again&s;t the world. Farewel, and God &s;end you a good deliverance! If Mr. Falkland's accu&s;ation, whatever it be, &s;hall appear to be premature, depend upon having me more zealou&s;ly your friend than ever. If not, this is the la&s;t act of friend&s;hip you will ever receive from me!</P>
<P>It may be believed that this addre&s;s, &s;o &s;ingular, &s;o &s;olemn, &s;o big with conditional menace, did not greatly tend to a&s;&s;uage my anxieties. I was totally ignorant of the charge to be advanced again&s;t me; and not a little a&s;toni&s;hed, when it was in my
<PB N="228" REF="028752_0230_0FDBF175B7804080">
power to be in the mo&s;t formidable degree the ac|cu&s;er of Mr. Falkland, to find the principles of equity &s;o completely rever&s;ed, as for the innocent, but in&s;tructed individual, to be the party accu&s;ed and &s;uffering, in&s;tead of having, as was ju&s;t, the real criminal at his mercy. I was &s;till more a&s;to|ni&s;hed at the &s;upernatural power Mr. Falkland &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s of bringing back by the mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible means the object of his per&s;ecution within the &s;phere of his authority; a reflection attended with &s;ome di&s;couragement to that thir&s;t of independence which now con&s;tituted the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of my mind.</P>
<P>But this was no time for meditation. To the &s;ufferer the cour&s;e of events is taken out of his di|rection, and he is hurried along with an irre&s;i&s;ti|ble force, without finding it within the compa&s;s of his efforts to check their rapidity. I was allowed only a very &s;hort time to recollect my&s;elf, when my trial commenced. I was conducted to the li|brary where I had pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many happy and &s;o many contemplative hours, and found there Mr. Fore&s;ter and three of four of the &s;ervants already a&s;&s;embled in expectation of me and my accu&s;er. Every thing was calculated to &s;ugge&s;t to me that I mu&s;t tru&s;t only in the ju&s;tice of the parties con|cerned, and had nothing to hope from their mercy. Mr. Falkland entered at one door, almo&s;t as &s;oon as I entered at the other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>HE began: It has been the principle of my life never to inflict a wilful injury upon any thing that lives; I need not expre&s;s my regret when I find my&s;elf obliged to be the promulgator of a criminal charge. How gladly would I pa&s;s unnoticed the evil I have &s;u&s;tained! but I owe it to &s;ociety to de|tect an offender, and prevent other men from be|ing impo&s;ed upon, as I have been, by an appear|ance of integrity.</P>
<P>It would be better, interrupted Mr. Fore&s;ter, to &s;peak directly to the point. We ought not,
<PB N="6" REF="028752_0234_0FDBF1A6544BC530">
though unwarily, by apologi&s;ing for our&s;elves, to create at &s;uch a time a prejudice again&s;t an indi|vidual, again&s;t whom a criminal accu&s;ation will always be prejudice enough.</P>
<P>I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect, continued Mr. Falkland, this young man, who has been peculiarly the object of my kindne&s;s, of having robbed me to a con&s;ider|able amount.</P>
<P>What, replied Mr. Fore&s;ter, are the grounds of your &s;u&s;picion?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of them is the actual lo&s;s! have &s;u&s;|tained in notes, jewels and plate. I have mi&s;&s;ed bank notes to the amount of nine hundred pounds, three gold repeaters of extraordinary value, a com|plete &s;uit of diamonds the property of my late mo|ther, and &s;everal other articles.</P>
<P>And why, continued my arbitrator, a&s;toni&s;h|ment, grief, and a de&s;ire to retain his &s;elf-po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;trongly contending in his countenance and voice, do you fix on this young man as the in&s;tru|ment of the depredation?</P>
<P>I found him, on my coming home upon the day when every thing was in di&s;order from the alarm of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire, in the very act of quitting the private apart|ment where the&s;e things were depo&s;ited. He was confounded at &s;eeing me, and ha&s;tened to withdraw as &s;oon as he po&s;&s;ibly could.</P>
<P>Did you &s;ay nothing to him, take no notice of the confu&s;ion your &s;udden appearance produced?</P>
<P>I a&s;ked what was his errand in that place. He was at fir&s;t &s;o terrified and overcome that he could not an&s;wer me. Afterwards with a good deal of faltering he &s;aid that, when all the &s;ervants were engaged in endeavouring to &s;ave the mo&s;t valuable part of my property, he had come hither with the &s;ame view; but that he had as yet removed no|thing.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="028752_0235_0FDBF1A7D1BF4DF0">
Did you immediately examine to &s;ee that every thing was &s;afe?</P>
<P>No. I was accu&s;tomed to confide in his hone&s;ty, and I was &s;uddenly called away in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance to attend to the increa&s;ing progre&s;s of the flames. I therefore only took out the key from the door of the apartment, having fir&s;t locked it, and, putting it in my pocket, ha&s;tened to go where my pre&s;ence &s;eemed indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>How long was it before you mi&s;&s;ed your pro|perty?</P>
<P>The &s;ame evening. The hurry of the &s;cene had driven the circum&s;tance entirely out of my mind, till, going by accident near the apartment, the whole affair, together with the &s;ingular and equi|vocal behaviour of Williams, ru&s;hed at once upon my recollection. I immediately entered, examined the che&s;t in which the&s;e things were contained, and to my a&s;toni&s;hment found the locks broken and the property gone.</P>
<P>What &s;teps did you take upon this di&s;covery?</P>
<P>I &s;ent for Williams, and talked to him very &s;e|riou&s;ly upon the &s;ubject. But he had now per|fectly recovered his &s;elf-command, and calmly and &s;toutly denied all knowledge of the matter. I urged him with the enormou&s;ne&s;s of the offence, but it made no impre&s;&s;ion. He did not di&s;cover either the &s;urpri&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> indignation one would have expected from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> entirely innocent, or the unea&s;ine&s;s that gener<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">y attends upon guilt. He was rather &s;ilent and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. I then informed him, that I &s;hould proce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> in a manner different from what he might perhaps expect. I would not, as is too frequent in &s;uch ca&s;es&punc; make a general re|&s;earch, for I had rather lo&s;e my property for ever without redre&s;s, than expo&s;e a multitude of inno|cent per&s;ons to anxiety and inju&s;tice. My &s;u&s;picion
<PB N="8" REF="028752_0236_0FDBF1F396AF7308">
for the pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="6 letters">dably fixed upon him. But in a matter of &s;o great con&s;equence I was deter|mined not to act upon &s;u&s;picion. I would neither incur the po&s;&s;ibility of raining him being inno|cent, nor be the in&s;trument of expo&s;ing others to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> depredations, if guilty. I &s;hould therefore merely in&s;i&s;t upon his continuing in my &s;ervice. He might depend upon it he &s;hould be well watch|ed, and I tru&s;ted the whole truth would eventually appear. Since he avoided confe&s;&s;ion now, I ad|vi&s;ed him to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ider how far it was likely he would come off with impunity at la&s;t. This I was de|termined on, that the moment he attempted an e&s;cape, I would confider that as an indication of guilt and proceed accordingly.</P>
<P>What circum&s;tances have occurred from that time to the pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>None upon which I can infer &punc; certainty of guilt. Several that agree to favour a &s;u&s;picion. From that time Williams was perpetually unea&s;y in his &s;ituation, always de&s;irous, as it now appears, to e&s;cape, but afraid to adopt &s;uch a mea&s;ure with|out certain precautions. It was not long after, that you, Mr. Fore&s;ter, became my vi&s;itor. I ob|&s;erved with di&s;&s;atisfaction the growing intercour&s;e between you, reflecting on the equivocalne&s;s of his character, and the attempt he would probably make to render you the dup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his hypocri&s;y. I accordingly threatened him &s;everely, and I believe you ob&s;erved the change that pre&s;ently after took place in his behaviour with relation to you.</P>
<P>I did, and it appeared at that time my&s;terious and extraordinary.</P>
<P>Some time after, as you well know, a rencounter took place between you, whether accidental or in|tentional on his part I am not able to &s;ay, when he confe&s;&s;ed to you the unea&s;ine&s;s of his mind without
<PB N="9" REF="028752_0237_0FDBF1ACA41AF350">
di&s;covering the cau&s;e, and openly propo&s;ed to you to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light, and &s;tand in ca&s;e of ne|ce&s;&s;ity between him and my re&s;entment. You offered, it &s;eems, to take him into your &s;ervice, but nothing, as he acknowledged, would an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, that did not place his retreat wholly out of my power to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>Did it not appear extraordinary to you that he &s;hould hope for any effectual protection from me, while it remained perpetually in your power to &s;a|tisfy me of his unworthine&s;s?</P>
<P>Perhaps he had hopes that I &s;hould not proceed to that &s;tep, at lea&s;t &s;o long as the place of his re|treat &s;hould be unknown to me, and of con&s;e|quence the event of my proceeding dubious. Per|haps he confided in his own powers, which are far from contemptible, to con&s;truct a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> plau&s;ible tale, e&s;pecially as he had taken care to have the fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion in his favour. After all, this protection on your part was merely re&s;erved in ca&s;e all other expedients failed. He does not appear to have had any other &s;entiment upon the &s;ubject, than that, if he were defeated in his projects for placing him|&s;elf beyond the reach of ju&s;tice, it was better to have be&s;poken him&s;elf a place in your patronage than to be de&s;titute of every re&s;ource.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland having thus fini&s;hed his evidence, called upon Robert, the valet, to confirm that part of it which related to the day of the fire.</P>
<P>Robert &s;tated, that he happened to be coming through the library that day, a few minutes after Mr. Falkland's being brought home by the &s;ight of the fire, that he had found me &s;tanding there with every mark of perturbation and fright, that he was &s;o &s;truck with my appearance that he could not help &s;topping to notice it, that he had &s;poken to me two or three times before he could obtain an an&s;wer,
<PB N="10" REF="028752_0238_0FDBF1F90876A040">
and that all he could get from me at la&s;t, was that I was the mo&s;t mi&s;erable creature alive.</P>
<P>He farther &s;aid, that in the evening of the &s;ame day Mr. Falkland called him into the private apart|ment adjoining to the library, and bid him bring him a hammer and &s;ome nails. He then &s;howed him a che&s;t &s;tanding in the apartment with its locks and fa&s;tenings broken, and ordered him to ob&s;erve and remember what he &s;aw, but not to mention it to any one. Robert did not at that time know what Mr. Falkland intended by the&s;e directions; but he entertained no doubt that the fa&s;tenings were broken and wrenched by the app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ication of a chi&s;&s;el or &s;uch like in&s;trument with the intention of forcibly open|ing the che&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Fore&s;ter ob&s;erved upon this evidence, that as much of it as related to the day of the fire &s;eem|ed indeed to afford powerful rea&s;ons for &s;u&s;picion, and that the circum&s;tances that had occurred &s;ince &s;trang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">oncurred to fortify that &s;u&s;picion. Mean|time, that nothing proper to be done might be omitted, he propo&s;ed &s;earching my boxes to &s;ee whether by that means any trace could be di&s;cover|ed to confirm the imputation. Mr. Falkland treat|ed this &s;ugge&s;tion &s;lightly, &s;aying that, if I were the thief, I had no doubt taken the precaution to obviate &s;o palpable a means of detection. To this Mr. Fore&s;ter only replied, that conjecture, how|ever &s;kilfully formed, was not always reali&s;ed in the actions and behaviour of mankind; and ordered that my boxes and trunks &s;hould be brought into the library. The two that were fir&s;t opened contained nothing to confirm the accu&s;ation again&s;t me; in the third were found a watch and &s;everal jewels that were immediately known to be the property of Mr. Falkland. The production of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">mingly deci&s;ive evidence excited emotions of a&s;toni&s;hment
<PB N="11" REF="028752_0239_0FDBF1AE0580CC58">
and concern: but no per&s;on's a&s;toni&s;hment appear|ed to be greater than that of Mr. Falkland.</P>
<P>To the re&s;t of the per&s;ons pre&s;ent I &s;eemed to be merely the &s;ubject of detection; but in reality I was of all the &s;pectators that individual who was mo&s;t at a lo&s;s to conceive through every &s;tage of the &s;cene what would come next, and who li&s;tened to every word that was uttered with the mo&s;t un|controulable amazement. Amazement however al|ternately yielded the a&s;cendancy to indignation and horror. At fir&s;t I could not refrain from repeated|ly attempting to interrupt; but I was checked in the&s;e attempts by Mr. Fore&s;ter, and I pre&s;ently felt how nece&s;&s;ary it was to my future peace that I &s;hould collect the whole energy of my mind to re|pel the charge, and a&s;&s;ert my innocence.</P>
<P>Every thing being now produced that could be produced again&s;t me, Mr. Fore&s;ter turned to me with a look of concern and pity, and told me that now was the time if I cho&s;e to allege any thing in my defence. In reply to this invitation I &s;poke nearly as follows:</P>
<P>I am innocent. It is in vain that circum&s;tances are accumulated again&s;t me: there is not a per&s;on upon earth le&s;s capable than I of the things of which I am accu&s;ed. I appeal to my heart; I ap|peal to my looks; I appeal to every &s;entiment my tongue ever uttered.</P>
<P>I could perceive that the fervour with which I &s;poke made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion upon every one that heard me. But in a moment their eyes were turn|ed upon the property that lay before them, and their countenances changed. I proceeded:</P>
<P>One thing more I mu&s;t aver; Mr. Falkland is not deceived: he perfectly knows that I am inno|cent.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="028752_0240_0FDBF1B487D0D2F0">
I had no &s;ooner uttered the&s;e words than an in|voluntary cry of indignation bur&s;t from every per|&s;on in the room. Mr. Fore&s;ter turned to me with a look of extreme &s;everity, and &s;aid:</P>
<P>Young man, con&s;ider well what you are doing! It is the privilege of the party accu&s;ed to &s;ay what|ever he thinks proper; and I will take care that you &s;hall enjoy that privilege in its utmo&s;t extent. But do you think it will conduce in any re&s;pect to your benefit to throw out &s;uch in&s;olent and intolerable in&s;inuations?</P>
<P>I thank you mo&s;t &s;incerely, replied I, for your caution; but I well know what it is that I am do|ing. I make this averment nor merely becau&s;e it is &s;olemnly true, but becau&s;e it is in&s;eparably con|nected with my vindication. I am the party ac|cu&s;ed, and I &s;hall be told that I am not to be be|lieved in my own defence. I can produce no other witne&s;&s;es of my innocence; I therefore call upon Mr. Falkland to be my evidence. I a&s;k him,</P>
<P>Did you never boa&s;t to me in private of your power to ruin me? Did you never &s;ay that, if once I brought on my&s;elf the weight of your di&s;|plea&s;ure, my fall &s;hould be irreparable? Did you not tell me that, though I &s;hould prepare in that ca&s;e a tale ever &s;o plau&s;ible or ever &s;o true, you would take care that the whole world &s;hould exe|crate me as an impo&s;tor? Were not tho&s;e your very words? Did you not add that my innocence &s;hould be of no &s;ervice to me, and that you laughed at &s;o feeble a defence? I a&s;k you farther, Did you not receive a letter from me the morning of the day on which I departed, reque&s;ting your con&s;ent to my departure? Should I have done that, if my flight had been that of a thief? I challenge any man to reconcile the expre&s;&s;ions of that letter with this accu&s;ation. Should I have begun with &s;tating that
<PB N="13" REF="028752_0241_0FDBF1B550E20580">
I had conceived a de&s;ire to quit your &s;ervice, if my de&s;ire and the rea&s;ons for it had been of the nature that is now alledged? Should I have dared to a&s;k for what rea&s;on I was thus &s;ubjected to an eternal penance?</P>
<P>Saying this, I took out a copy of my letter and laid it open upon the table.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland returned no immediate an&s;wer to my interrogations. Mr. Fore&s;ter turned to him, and &s;aid, Well, &s;ir, what is your reply to this chal|lenge of your &s;ervant?</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland an&s;wered: Such a mode of defence hardly &s;tands in need of a reply. But I an&s;wer, I held no &s;uch conver&s;ation; I never u&s;ed &s;uch words; I received no &s;uch letter. Surely it is no &s;ufficient rebutter of a criminal charge, that the criminal repels what is alledged again&s;t him with volubility of &s;peech and intrepidity of manner?</P>
<P>Mr. Fore&s;ter then turned to me. If, &s;aid he, you tru&s;t your vindication to the plau&s;ibility of your tale, you mu&s;t take care to render it con&s;i&s;tent and complete. You have not told us what was the cau&s;e of the confu&s;ion and anxiety in which Robert pro|fe&s;&s;es to have found you, why you were &s;o impa|tient to quit the &s;ervice of Mr. Falkland, or how you account for certain articles of his property being found in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>All that, &s;ir, an&s;wered I, is true. There are certain parts of my &s;tory that I have not told. If they were told, they would not contribute to my di&s;advantage, and they would make the pre&s;ent ac|cu&s;ation appear &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing. But I can|not, as yet at lea&s;t, prevail upon my&s;elf to tell them. Is it nece&s;&s;ary to give any particular and preci&s;e rea&s;ons why I &s;hould wi&s;h to change the place of my re&s;idence? You all of you know the unfortu|nate &s;tate of Mr. Falkland's mind. You know the
<PB N="14" REF="028752_0242_0FDBF1FA55A8C4F0">
&s;ternne&s;s, re&s;ervedne&s;s and di&s;tance of his manners. If I had no other rea&s;ons, &s;urely it would afford &s;mall pre&s;umption of criminality that I &s;hould wi&s;h to change his &s;ervice for another.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion of how the&s;e articles of Mr. Falk|land's property came to be found in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is more material. It is a que&s;tion I am wholly unable to an&s;wer. Their being found there was at lea&s;t as unexpected to me as to any one of the per&s;ons now pre&s;ent. I only know that, as I have the mo&s;t perfect a&s;&s;urance of Mr. Falkland's being con&s;cious of my innocence, for, ob&s;erve! I do not &s;hrink from that a&s;&s;ertion, I reiterate it with new confidence; I therefore firmly and from my &s;oul believe that their being there is of Mr. Falkland's contrivance.</P>
<P>I had no &s;ooner &s;aid this, than I was again in|terrupted by an involuntary exclamation from every one pre&s;ent. They looked at me with furi|ous glances, as if they could have torn me to pieces, I proceeded:</P>
<P>I have now an&s;wered every thing that is alleged again&s;t me.</P>
<P>Mr. Fore&s;ter, you are a lover of ju&s;tice; I con|jure you not to violate it in my per&s;on. You are a man of penetration; look at me, do you &s;ee any of the marks of guilt? Recollect all that has ever pa&s;&s;ed under your ob&s;ervation; is it compatible with a mind capable of what is now alleged again&s;t me? Could a real criminal have &s;hown him&s;elf &s;o unaba&s;hed, compo&s;ed and firm as I have now done?</P>
<P>Fellow &s;ervants! Mr. Falkland is a man of rank and fortune; he is your ma&s;ter. I am a poor country lad without a friend in the world. That is a ground of real difference to a certain extent; but it is not a &s;ufficient ground for the &s;ubver&s;ion
<PB N="15" REF="028752_0243_0FDBF1BB496AC440">
of ju&s;tice. Remember, that I am in a &s;ituation that is not to be trifled with, that a deci&s;ion given again&s;t me now, in a ca&s;e in which I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you I am innocent, will for ever deprive me of reputation and peace of mind, combine the whole world in a league again&s;t me, and determine perhaps upon my liberty and my life. If you believe, if you &s;ee, if you know that I am inno|cent, &s;peak for me. Do not &s;uffer a pu&s;illanimous timidity to prevent you from &s;aving a fellow crea|ture from de&s;truction, who does not de&s;erve to have a human being for his enemy. Why have we the power of &s;peech, but to communicate our thoughts? I will never believe that a man con|&s;cious of innocence, cannot make other men per|ceive that he has that thought. Do not you feel that my whole heart tells me, I am not guilty of what is imputed to me?</P>
<P>To you, Mr. Falkland, I have nothing to &s;ay. I know you, and know that you are impenetrable. At the very moment that you are urging &s;uch odious charges again&s;t me, you admire my re&s;o|lution and forbearance. But I have nothing to hope from you. You can look upon my ruin without pity or remor&s;e. I am mo&s;t unfortunate indeed in having to do with &s;uch an adver&s;ary. You oblige me to &s;ay ill things of you; but I ap|peal to your own heart whether it is not in my power to &s;ay infinitely wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Every thing that could be alleged on either &s;ide being now concluded, Mr. Fore&s;ter undertook to make &s;ome remarks upon the whole. Williams, &s;aid he, the charge again&s;t you is heavy; the di|rect evidence is &s;trong; the corroborating circum|&s;tances are numerous and &s;triking. I grant that you have &s;hown con&s;iderable dexterity in your an|&s;wers; but you will learn, young man, to your
<PB N="16" REF="028752_0244_0FDBF200DEFD5D68">
co&s;t, that dexterity, however powerful it may be in certain ca&s;es, will avail little again&s;t the &s;tub|bornne&s;s of truth. It is fortunate for mankind that the empire of talents has its limitations, and that it is not in the power of ingenuity to &s;ubvert the di&s;tinctions of right and wrong. Take my word for it, that the true merits of the ca&s;e again&s;t you will be too &s;trong for &s;ophi&s;try to overturn, that ju&s;tice will prevail, and impotent malice be defeated.</P>
<P>To you, Mr. Falkland, &s;ociety is obliged for hav|ing placed this black affair in its true light. Do not &s;uffer the malignant a&s;per&s;ions of the criminal to give you any unea&s;ine&s;s. Depend upon it that they will be found of no weight. I have no doubt that your character in the judgment of every per|&s;on that has heard them &s;tands higher than ever. We feel for your misfortune in being obliged to hear &s;uch calumnies from a per&s;on who has in|jured you &s;o gro&s;sly. But you mu&s;t be con&s;idered in that re&s;pect as a martyr in the public cau&s;e. The purity of your motives and di&s;po&s;itions are beyond the reach of malice; and truth and equity will not fail to award to your calumniator in|famy, and to you the love and approbation of mankind.</P>
<P>I have now told you, Williams, what I think of your ca&s;e. But I have no right to a&s;&s;ume to be your ultimate&punc; judge. De&s;perate as it appears to me, I will give you one piece of advice as if I were retained as a coun&s;el to a&s;&s;i&s;t you. Leave out of it whatever tells to the di&s;advantage of Mr. Falkland. Defend your&s;elf as well as you can, but do not attack your ma&s;ter. It is your bu&s;i|ne&s;s to create in tho&s;e that hear you a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in your favour. But the recrimination you have been now practi&s;ing will always create indigna|tion.
<PB N="17" REF="028752_0245_0FDBF1BC111E0CB0">
Di&s;hone&s;ty will admit of &s;ome palliation. The deliberate malice you have now been &s;howing is a thou&s;and times more atrocious. It proves you to have the mind of a demon rather than a felon. Wherever you &s;hall repeat it, tho&s;e who hear you will pronounce you guilty upon that, even if the proper evidence again&s;t you were glaringly defec|tive. If therefore you would con&s;ult your intere&s;t, which &s;eems to be your only con&s;ideration, it is incumbent upon you by all means immediately to retract that. If you de&s;ire to be believed hone&s;t, you mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place &s;how that you have a due &s;en&s;e of merit in others. You cannot better &s;erve your cau&s;e than by begging pardon of your ma&s;ter, and doing homage to rectitude and worth even when they are employed in vengeance again&s;t you.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to conceive that my mind &s;u&s;tained an extreme &s;hock from the deci&s;ion of Mr. Fore&s;ter; but his call upon me to retract and humble my&s;elf before my accu&s;er penetrated my whole &s;oul with indignation. I an&s;wered:</P>
<P>I have already told you I am innocent. I believe that I could not endure the effort of inventing a plau&s;ible defence, if it were otherwi&s;e. You have ju&s;t affirmed that it is not in the power of inge|nuity to &s;ubvert the di&s;tinctions of right and wrong, and in that very moment I find them &s;ub|verted. This is indeed to me a very awful mo|ment. New to the world, I know nothing of its affairs but what has reached me by rumour, or is recorded in books. I have come into it with all the ardour and confidence in&s;eparable from my years. In every fellow-being I expected to find a friend. I am unpracti&s;ed in its wiles, and have even no acquaintance with its inju&s;tice. I have done nothing to de&s;erve the animo&s;ity of mankind,
<PB N="18" REF="028752_0246_0FDBF201DBF24C00">
but, if I may judge from the pre&s;ent &s;cene, I am from henceforth to be deprived of the benefits of integrity and honour. I am to forfeit the friend|&s;hip of every one I have hitherto known, and to be precluded from the power of acquiring that of others. I mu&s;t therefore be reduced to derive my &s;atisfaction from my&s;elf. Depend upon it I will not begin that career by di&s;honourable conce&s;&s;ions. If I am to de&s;pair of the good will of other men, I will at lea&s;t maintain the independence of my own mind. Mr. Falkland is my implacable ene|my. Whatever may be his merits in other re|&s;pects, he is acting towards me without huma|nity, without remor&s;e and without principle. Do you think I will ever make any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to a man by whom I am thus treated, that I will fall down at the feet of one who is to me a devil, or ki&s;s the hand that is red with my blood?</P>
<P>In that re&s;pect, an&s;wered Mr. Fore&s;ter, do as you &s;hall think proper. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that your firmne&s;s and con&s;i&s;tency a&s;toni&s;h me. They add &s;omething to what I had conceived of human pow|ers. Perhaps you have cho&s;en the part which all things con&s;idered may &s;erve your purpo&s;e be&s;t, though I think more moderation would be more conciliating. The exterior of innocence will, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ant, &s;tagger the per&s;ons who may have the di|rection of your fate, but it will never be able to prevail again&s;t plain and incontrovertible facts. But I have done with you. I &s;ee in you a new in|&s;tance of that abu&s;e which is &s;o generally made of talents the admiration of an undi&s;cerning public. I regard you with horror. And all that remains is that I &s;hould di&s;charge my duty in con&s;igning you as a mon&s;ter of depravity to the ju&s;tice of your country.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="028752_0247_0FDBF1C0DD4BD120">
No, rejoined Mr. Falkland, to that I can never con&s;ent. I have put a re&s;traint upon my&s;elf thus far, becau&s;e it was right that evidence and en|quiry &s;hould take their cour&s;e. I have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all my habits and &s;entiments, becau&s;e it &s;eemed due to the public that hypocri&s;y &s;hould be un|ma&s;ked. But I can &s;uffer this violence no longer. I have through my whole life interfered to protect, not overbear the &s;ufferer; and I mu&s;t do &s;o now. I feel not the &s;malle&s;t re&s;entment of his impotent attacks upon my character; I &s;mile at their malice; and they make no diminution in my benevolence to their author. Let him &s;ay what he plea&s;es; he cannot hurt me. It was proper that he &s;hould be brought to public &s;hame, that other people might not be deceived by him as we have been. But there is no nece&s;&s;ity for proceed|ing any farther; and I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it that he be permitted to depart wherever he plea&s;es. I am &s;orry that public intere&s;t affords &s;o gloomy a pro&s;|pect for his future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland, an&s;wered Mr. Fore&s;ter, the&s;e &s;en|timents do honour to your humanity; but I mu&s;t not give way to them. They only &s;erve to &s;et in a &s;tronger light the venom of this &s;erpent, this mon&s;ter of ingratitude, who fir&s;t robs his bene|factor, and then reviles him. Wretch that you are, will nothing move you? Are you inacce&s;&s;i|ble to remor&s;e? Are you not &s;truck to the heart with the unmerited goodne&s;s of your ma&s;ter? Vile calumniator! you are the abhorrence of nature, the opprobrium of the human &s;pecies, and the earth can only be freed from an in&s;upportable bur|then by your being exterminated! Recollect, &s;ir, that this villain, at the very moment that you are exerci&s;ing &s;uch unexampled forbearance in his be|half, has the pre&s;umption to charge you with pro|&s;ecuting
<PB N="20" REF="028752_0248_0FDBF203ACBE6050">
a crime of which you know him to be innocent, nay, with having conveyed the pretend|ed &s;tolen goods among his property for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of ruining him. By this unexampled vil|lainy he makes it your duty to free the world from &s;uch a pe&s;t, and your intere&s;t to admit no relaxing in your pur&s;uit of him, le&s;t the world &s;hould be per&s;uaded by your clemency to credit his vile in|&s;inuations.</P>
<P>I care no for con&s;equences, replied Mr. Falk|land, I will obey the dictates of my own mind. I will never lend my per&s;onal a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the reform|ing mankind by axes and gibbets; I am &s;ure things will never go well, till honour and not law be the dictator of mankind, till vice is taught to &s;hrink before the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s might of inborn dignity, and not before the cold formality of &s;tatutes. If my calumniator were worthy of my re&s;entment I would cha&s;ti&s;e him with my own &s;word, and not that of the magi&s;trate; but in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e I &s;mile at his malice, and re&s;olve to &s;pare him, as the gene|rous lord of the fore&s;t &s;pares the in&s;ect that would di&s;turb his repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The language you now hold, &s;aid Mr. Fore&s;ter, is that of romance, and not of rea&s;on. Yet I can|not but be &s;truck with the contra&s;t exhibited be|fore me of the magnanimity of virtue and the ob|&s;tinate, impenetrable inju&s;tice of guilt. While your mind overflows with goodne&s;s, nothing can touch the heart of this thrice-bred villain. I &s;hall never forgive my&s;elf for having once been entrap|ped by his dete&s;table arts. This is no time for us to &s;ettle the que&s;tion between chivalry and law. I &s;hall therefore &s;imply in&s;i&s;t as a magi&s;trate, having taken the evidence in this felony, upon my right and duty of following the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, and committing the accu&s;ed to the county jail.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="028752_0249_0FDBF1C2134453C8">
After &s;ome farther conte&s;t Mr. Falkland, find|ing Mr. Fore&s;ter ob&s;tinate and impracticable, with|drew his oppo&s;ition. Accordingly a proper officer was &s;ummoned from the neighbouring village, a mittimus made out, and one of Mr. Falkland's carriages prepared to conduct me to the place of cu&s;tody. It will ea&s;ily be imagined that this &s;udden rever&s;e was very painfully felt by me. I looked round on the &s;ervants who had been the &s;pectators of my examinations, but not one of them either by word or ge&s;ture expre&s;&s;ed any compa&s;&s;ion for my calami|ty. The robbery of which I was accu&s;ed appeared to them atrocious from its magnitude, and what|ever &s;parks of compa&s;&s;ion might otherwi&s;e have &s;prung up in their ingenuous and undi&s;ciplined minds, were totally obliterated by indignation at my &s;uppo&s;ed profligacy in recriminating upon their worthy and excellent ma&s;ter. My fate being already determined, and one of the &s;ervants di&s;patched for the officer, Mr. Fore&s;ter and Mr. Falkland with|drew, and left me in the cu&s;tody of two others.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e was the &s;ervant who had gone in pur&s;uit of me and found me at the market-town from whence I had intended to take coach for Lon|don. I was willing accurately to di&s;cover the &s;tate of mind of tho&s;e who had been witne&s;&s;es of this &s;cene, and who had had &s;ome previous opportunity of ob&s;erving my character and manners. I therefore endeavoured to open a conver&s;ation with him. Well, my good Thomas, &s;aid I, in a querulous tone and with a he&s;itating manner, am I not a mo&s;t mi&s;erable creature?</P>
<P>Do n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;peak to me, ma&s;ter Williams! You have given me a &s;hock that I &s;hall not get the better of for one while.

<P>Thomas, I am innocent! I &s;wear by the great God that &s;hall judge me another day, I am inno|cent!</P>
<P>Pray, do not &s;wear! for goodne&s;s &s;ake, do not &s;wear! Your poor &s;oul is damned enough without that. For your &s;ake, lad, I will never take any body's word, nor tru&s;t to appearances, thof it &s;hould be an angel. Lord ble&s;s us! how &s;moothly you palavered it over, for all the world as if you had been as fair as a new-born babe! But it will not do; you will never be able to per&s;uade peo|ple that black is white. For my own part I have done with you. I loved you ye&s;terday, all one as if you had been my own brother. To day I love you &s;o well, that I would go ten miles with all the plea&s;ure in life to &s;ee you hanged.</P>
<P>Good God! Thomas, have you the heart? What a change! I call God to witne&s;s I have done no|thing to de&s;erve it! What a world do we live in!</P>
<P>Hold your tongue, boy! It makes my very heart &s;ick to hear you! I would not lay a night under the &s;ame roof with you for all the world! I &s;hould ex|pect the hou&s;e to fall and cru&s;h &s;uch wickedne&s;s! I admire that the earth does not open and &s;wallow you alive! It is poi&s;on &s;o much as to look at you!

could overcome his prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I took his advice and was &s;ilent. It was not much longer before every thing was prepared for my departure, and I was conducted to the &s;ame pri&s;on which had &s;o lately inclo&s;ed the wretched and innocent Haw|kin&s;es. They too had been the victims of Mr. Falkland.

<P>FOR my own part I had never &s;een a pri&s;on, and like the majority of my brethren had given my&s;elf little concern to enquire what was the con|dition of tho&s;e who committed offence again&s;t, or became obnoxious to &s;u&s;picion from the community. Oh, how enviable is the mo&s;t tottering &s;hed under which the labourer retires to re&s;t, compared with the re&s;idence of the&s;e walls!</P>
<P>To me every thing was new, the ma&s;&s;y doors, the re&s;ounding locks, the gloomy pa&s;&s;ages, the grated windows, and the characteri&s;tic looks of the keepers, accu&s;tomed to reject every petition, and to &s;teel their hearts again&s;t feeling and pity. Cu|rio&s;ity and a &s;en&s;e of my &s;ituation induced me to fix my eyes on the faces of the&s;e men, but in a few minutes I drew them away with unconquer|able loathing. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the &s;ort of &s;qualidne&s;s and filth with which the&s;e man&s;ions are di&s;tingui&s;hed. I have &s;een dirty faces in dirty apartments, which have neverthele&s;s borne the impre&s;&s;ion of health, and &s;poke carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and le|vity rather than di&s;tre&s;s. But the dirt of a pri&s;on &s;peaks &s;adne&s;s to the heart, and appears to be alrea|dy in a &s;tate of putridity and infection.</P>
<P>I was detained for more than an hour in the apart|ment of the keeper, one turnkey after another coming in, that they might make them&s;elves fami|liar with my per&s;on. As I was already con&s;idered
<PB N="25" REF="028752_0253_0FDBF1CA5C5C3D18">
as guilty of felony to a con&s;iderable amount, I underwent a rigorous &s;earch, and they took from me a penknife, a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and that part of my money which was in gold. It was debated whether or not the&s;e &s;hould be &s;ealed up, to be re|turned to me, as they &s;aid, as &s;oon as I &s;hould be acquitted; and had I not di&s;played an unexpected firmne&s;s of manner and vigour of expo&s;tulation, &s;uch was the conduct that would have been pur|&s;ued. Having undergone the&s;e ceremonies, I was thru&s;t into a day-room in which all the per&s;ons then under confinement for felony were a&s;&s;embled, to the number of eleven. Each of them was too much engaged in his own reflections to take notice of me. Of the&s;e two were impri&s;oned for hor&s;e-&s;tealing, and three for having &s;tolen a &s;heep, one for &s;hop-lifting, one for coining, two for highway-robbery and two for burglary.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e-&s;tealers were engaged in a game at cards, which was pre&s;ently interrupted by a dif|ference of opinion, attended with great vocifera|tion, they calling upon one and another to decide it to no purpo&s;e, one paying no attention to their &s;ummons, and another leaving them in the mid&s;t of their &s;tory, being no longer able to endure his own internal angui&s;h in the mid&s;t of their mum|mery.</P>
<P>It is a cu&s;tom among thieves to con&s;titute a &s;ort of mock tribunal of their own body, from who&s;e deci&s;ion every one is informed whether he &s;hall be acquitted, re&s;pited or pardoned, as well as re&s;pect|ing the mo&s;t &s;kilful way of conducting his de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ence. One of the hou&s;ebreakers who had already pa&s;&s;ed this ordeal was &s;talking up and down the room with a forced bravery, exclaiming to his companion that he was as rich as the duke of Bedford him&s;elf. He had five gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">as and a half, which was as much

as he could po&s;&s;ibly &s;pend in the cour&s;e of the en|&s;uing month, and what happened after that it was Jack Ketch's bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee to, not his. As he uttered the&s;e words he threw him&s;elf abruptly upon a bench that was near him, and &s;eemed to be a&s;leep in a moment. But his &s;leep was unea&s;y and di&s;|turbed, his breathing was hard, and at intervals had rather the nature of a groan. A young fellow from the other &s;ide of the room came &s;oftly to the place where he lay with a large knife in his hand, and pre&s;&s;ed the back of it with &s;uch violence upon his neck, the head hanging over the &s;ide of the bench, that it was not till after &s;everal efforts that he was able to ri&s;e. Oh, Jack! cried this manual je&s;ter, I had almo&s;t done your bu&s;ine&s;s for you! The other expre&s;&s;ed no marks of re&s;entment, but &s;ullenly an&s;wered, Damn you, why did not you take the edge?

<P>The ca&s;e of one of the per&s;ons committed for highway-robbery was not a little extraordinary. He was a common &s;oldier, of a mo&s;t engaging phy&s;iognomy, and two and twenty years of age. The pro&s;ecutor, who had been robbed one evening as he returned very late from the alehou&s;e, of the &s;um of three &s;hillings, &s;wore po&s;itively to his per|&s;on. The character of the pri&s;oner was &s;uch as has &s;eldom been equalled. The meanne&s;s of his condition did not preclude him from the pur&s;uit of intellectual cultivation; and he drew his favourite amu&s;ement from the works of Virgil and Horace. His integrity had been proverbially great. In one in&s;tance he had been employed by a lady to convey a &s;um of a thou&s;and pounds to a per&s;on at &s;ome
<PB N="27" REF="028752_0255_0FDBF1CEEB6CAF18">
miles di&s;tance: in another he was intru&s;ted by a gentleman during his ab&s;ence with the care of his hou&s;e and furniture to the value of at lea&s;t five times that &s;um. His habits of thinking were pe|culiar, full of ju&s;tice, &s;implicity and wi&s;dom. He from time to time earned money of his officers by his peculiar excellence in furbi&s;hing arms; but he declined offers that had been made him to become a &s;erjeant or a corporal, &s;aying, that he did not want money, and that in a new &s;ituation he &s;hould have le&s;s lei&s;ure for &s;tudy. He was equally con|&s;tant in refu&s;ing pre&s;ents that were offered him by per&s;ons that had been &s;truck with his merit: not that he was under the influence of fal&s;e delicacy and pride, but that his con&s;cience would not allow him to accept that, the want of which he did not feel to be an evil. This man died while I was in pri&s;on.

<P>The whole day I was obliged to &s;pend in the company of the&s;e men, &s;ome of them having really committed the actions laid to their charge, others whom their ill fortune had rendered the victims of &s;u&s;picion. The whole was a &s;cene of mi&s;ery &s;uch as nothing &s;hort of actual ob&s;ervation can &s;ugge&s;t to the mind. Some were noi&s;y and ob&s;treperous, endeavouring by a fal&s;e bravery to keep at bay the remembrance of their condition; while others, incapable even of this effort, had the torment of their thoughts aggravated by the perpetual noi&s;e and confu&s;ion that prevailed around them. In the faces of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;umed the mo&s;t courage you might trace the furrows of anxious care, and in the mid&s;t of their laboured hilarity dreadful ideas would ever and anon intrude, convul&s;ing their features and

working every line into an expre&s;&s;ion of the keene&s;t agony. To the&s;e men the &s;un brought no return of joy. Day after day ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed on, but their &s;tate was immutable.

<P>Such were our days. At &s;un-&s;et our jailors ap|peared, and ordered each man to come away, and be locked into his dungeon. It was a bitter ag|gravation of our fate to be under the arbitrary controul of the&s;e fellows. They felt no man's &s;or|row; they were of all men lea&s;t capable of any &s;ort of feeling. They had a barbarous and &s;ullen plea&s;ure in i&s;&s;uing their dete&s;ted mandates, and ob&s;erving the mournful reluctance with which they were obeyed. Whatever they directed, it was in vain to expo&s;tulate; &s;etters and bread and water were the &s;ure con&s;equences of re&s;i&s;tance. Their tyranny had no other limit than their own caprice; to whom &s;hall the unfortunate felon appeal? To what purpo&s;e complain, when his complaints are &s;ure to be received with incredulity?

<P>Among my melancholy reflections I ta&s;ked my memory, and counted over the doors, the lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ks, the chains, the ma&s;&s;y walls and grated windows that were between me and liberty. The&s;e, &s;aid I, are the engines that tyranny &s;its down in cold and &s;erious meditation to invent. This is the empire that man exerci&s;es over man. Thus is a being, formed to expatiate, to act, to &s;mile and enjoy, re&s;tricted and benumbed. How great mu&s;t be his depravity or heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s who vindicates this &s;cheme for changing health and gaiety and &s;erenity, into the wanne&s;s of a dungeon and the deep furrows of agony and de&s;pair!</P>
<P>Thank God, exclaims the Engli&s;hman, we have no Ba&s;tille! Thank God, with us no man can be puni&s;hed without a crime! Unthinking wretch!

<P>For my&s;elf I looked round upon my walls, and forward upon the premature death I had too much rea&s;on to expect; I con&s;ulted my own heart that whi&s;pered nothing but innocence; and I &s;aid, This is &s;ociety.

<P>I believed that mi&s;ery, more pure than that which I now endured, had never fallen to the lot of a human being. I recollected with a&s;toni&s;hment my puerile eagerne&s;s to be brought to the te&s;t and have my innocence examined. I execrated it as the vile&s;t and mo&s;t in&s;ufferable pedantry. I exclaimed in the bitterne&s;s of my heart, Of what value is a fair fame? It is the jewel of men formed to be amu&s;ed with baubles. Without it I might have had &s;ere|nity of heart and chearfulne&s;s of occupation, peace and liberty; why &s;hould I con&s;ign my happine&s;s to other men's arbitration? But, if a fair fame were of the mo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible value, is this the method which common &s;en&s;e would pre&s;cribe to retrieve it? The language which the&s;e in&s;titutions hold out to the unfortunate is, Come, and be &s;hut out from the light of day, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he a&s;&s;ociate of tho&s;e whom &s;ociety has marked out for her abhorrence, be the &s;lave of jailers, be loaded with fetters; thus &s;hall you be cleared from every unworthy a&s;per|&s;ion, and re&s;tored to reputation and honour! This is the con&s;olation &s;he affords to tho&s;e who&s;e malig|nity or folly, private pique or unfounded po&s;i|tivene&s;s have without the &s;malle&s;t foundation loaded with calumny. For my&s;elf I felt my own inno|cence, and I &s;oon found upon enquiry that three-fourths of tho&s;e who are regularly &s;ubjected to a &s;imilar treatment, are per&s;ons, whom even with all the &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s and precipitation of our courts of ju&s;tice no evidence can be found to convict.

<P><PB N="32" REF="028752_0260_0FDBF216174605E8">
But my ca&s;e was even wor&s;e than this. I inti|mately felt that a trial, &s;uch as in&s;titution is able to make it, is only the worthy &s;equel of &s;uch a be|ginning. What chance had I, after the purgation I was now &s;uffering, that I &s;hould come out ac|quitted at la&s;t? What probability was there that the trial I had ju&s;t endured in the hou&s;e of Mr. Falkland was not ju&s;t as fair as any that might be expected to follow?

<P>Thus was I cut off for ever from all that exi&s;t|ence has to be&s;tow, from all the high hopes I had &s;o often conceived, from all the future excellence my &s;oul &s;o much delighted to imagine, to &s;pend a few weeks in a mi&s;erable pri&s;on, and then to peri&s;h by the hands of the public executioner. No lan|guage can do ju&s;tice to the indignant and &s;oul-&s;ickening loathing that the&s;e ideas excited. My re&s;entment was not re&s;tricted to my pro&s;ecutor, but extended it&s;elf to take in the whole machine of human &s;ociety. I could never believe that all this was the fair re&s;ult of in&s;titutions in&s;eparable from the general good. I regarded the whole human &s;pecies as &s;o many hangmen and torturers. I con|&s;idered them as confederated to tear me to pieces; and this wide &s;cene of inexorable per&s;ecution in|flicted upon me inexpre&s;&s;ible agony. I looked on this &s;ide and on that; I was innocent, I had a right to expect a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but every heart was ready to lend its force to make my ruin &s;ecure.

<P><PB N="33" REF="028752_0261_0FDBF1D650B1B650">
What relief had I from the&s;e &s;en&s;ations? Was it relief that I &s;pent the day in the mid&s;t of pro|fligacy and execrations, that I &s;aw reflected from every countenance agonies only inferior to my own? He that would form a lively idea of the re|gions of the damned, needed only to witne&s;s for &s;ix hours a &s;cene to which I was confined for many months. Not for one hour could I withdraw my|&s;elf from this complexity of horrors, or take re|fuge in the calmne&s;s of meditation. Air, exer|ci&s;e, &s;eries, contra&s;t, tho&s;e grand enliveners of the human frame, I was for ever debarred, by the in|exorable tyranny under which I was fallen. Nor did I find the &s;olitude of my nightly dungeon le&s;s in&s;upportable. Its only furniture was the &s;traw that &s;erved me for my repo&s;e. It was narrow, damp and unwhole&s;ome. The &s;lumbers of a mind, wearied like mine with the mo&s;t dete&s;table uni|formity, to whom neither amu&s;ement nor occupa|tion ever offered them&s;elves to beguile the painful hours, were &s;hort, di&s;turbed and unrefre&s;hing. My &s;leeping, &s;till more than my waking thoughts, were full of perplexity, deformity and di&s;order. To the&s;e &s;lumbers &s;ucceeded the hours which by the regulations of our pri&s;on I was obliged though awake to &s;pend in &s;olitary and chearle&s;s darkne&s;s.

I could not &s;ink it in lethargy; I could not forget my woes; they haunted me with unintermitted and demoniac malice.

<P>SUCH were the reflections that haunted the fir&s;t days of my impri&s;onment, in con&s;equence of which they were &s;pent in perpetual angui&s;h. But after a time nature, wearied with di&s;tre&s;s, would no longer &s;toop to the burthen; thought, which is ince&s;&s;antly varying, introduced a &s;eries of re|flections totally different.</P>
<P>My fortitude revived. I had always been ac|cu&s;tomed to chearfulne&s;s, good-humour and &s;ere|nity, and this habit now returned to vi&s;it me at the bottom of my dungeon. No &s;ooner did my contemplations take this turn, than I &s;aw the rea|&s;onablene&s;s and po&s;&s;ibility of tranquillity and peace, and my mind whi&s;pered to me the propriety of &s;howing in this forlorn condition that I was &s;upe|rior to all my per&s;ecutors. Ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate of inno|cence and &s;elf-approbation! The &s;un&s;hine of con|&s;cious integrity pierced through all the harriers of my cell, and &s;poke ten thou&s;and times more joy to my heart than the accumulated &s;plendours of na|ture and art can communicate to the &s;laves of vice.</P>
<P>I found out the &s;ecret of employing my mind. I &s;aid, I am &s;hut up for half the day in total dark|ne&s;s without any external &s;ource of amu&s;ement; the other half I &s;pend in the mid&s;t of noi&s;e, tur|bulence and confu&s;ion. What then? Can I not draw amu&s;ement from the &s;tores of my own mind? Is it not freighted with various knowledge? Have I not been employed from my infancy in gratifying an in&s;atiable curio&s;ity? When &s;hould I derive be|nefit
<PB N="36" REF="028752_0264_0FDBF21C983985D8">
from the&s;e &s;uperior advantages, if not at pre|&s;ent? Accordingly I ta&s;ked the &s;tores of my me|mory and my powers of invention. I amu&s;ed my|&s;elf with recollecting the hi&s;tory of my life. By degrees I called to mind a number of minute cir|cum&s;tances which but for this exerci&s;e would have been for ever forgotten. I repa&s;&s;ed in my thoughts whole conver&s;ations, I recollected their &s;ubjects, their arrangement, their incidents and frequently their very words. I mu&s;ed upon the&s;e ideas till I was totally ab&s;orbed in thought. I repeated them till my mind glowed with enthu&s;ia&s;m. I had my different employments fitted for the &s;olitude of the night in which I could give full &s;cope to the im|pul&s;es of my mind, and the uproar of the day in which my chief object was to be in&s;en&s;ible to the di&s;order with which I was &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>By degrees I quitted my own &s;tory, and amu&s;ed my&s;elf with imaginary adventures. I figured to my&s;elf every &s;ituation in which I could be placed, and conceived the conduct to be ob&s;erved in each. Thus &s;cenes of in&s;ult and danger, of tenderne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion became familiar to me. In fancy I often pa&s;&s;ed the awful hour of di&s;&s;olving nature. In &s;ome of my reveries I boiled with impetuous indignation, and in others patiently collected the whole force of my mind for &s;ome fearful encoun|ter. I cultivated the powers of oratory &s;uited to the&s;e different &s;tates, and improved more in elo|quence in the &s;olitude of my dungeon, than per|haps I &s;hould have done in the bu&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t crowded &s;cenes At length I proceeded to as re|gular a di&s;po&s;ition of my time, as the man in his &s;tudy who pa&s;&s;es from mathematics to poetry, and from poetry to the law of nations in the different parts of each &s;ingle day; and I as &s;eldom infringed upon my plan. Nor were my &s;ubjects of di&s;qui|&s;ition
<PB N="37" REF="028752_0265_0FDBF1DAD19DF6C8">
le&s;s numerous than his. I went over, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of memory only, a con&s;iderable part of Euclid during my confinement, and revived day after day the &s;eries of facts and incidents in &s;ome of the mo&s;t celebrated hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>While I was thus employed I reflected with ex|ultation upon the degree in which man is inde|pendent of the &s;miles and frowns of fortune. I was beyond her reach, for I could fall no lower. To an ordinary eye I might &s;eem de&s;titute and mi&s;erable, but in reality I wanted for nothing. My fare was coar&s;e; but I was in health. My dungeon was noi&s;ome; but I felt no inconvenience. I was &s;hut up from the u&s;ual means of exerci&s;e and air; but I found the method of exerci&s;ing my|&s;elf even to per&s;piration in my dungeon. I had no means of withdrawing my per&s;on from a di&s;gu&s;tful &s;ociety in the mo&s;t chearful and valuable part of the day; but I &s;oon brought to perfection the art of withdrawing my thoughts, and &s;aw and heard the people about me for ju&s;t as &s;hort a time and as &s;eldom as I plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Such is man in him&s;elf con&s;idered; &s;o &s;imple his nature; &s;o few his wants. How different from the man of artificial &s;ociety! Palaces are built for his reception, a thou&s;and vehicles provided for his exerci&s;e, provinces are ran&s;acked for the gratifica|tion of his appetite, and the whole world traver&s;ed to &s;upply him with apparel and furniture. Thus va&s;t is his expenditure, and the purcha&s;e &s;lavery. He is dependent on a thou&s;and accidents for tran|quillity and health, and his body and &s;oul are at the devotion of whoever will &s;atisfy his imperious cravings.</P>
<P>In addition to the di&s;advantages of my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, I was re&s;erved for an ignominious death. What then? Every man mu&s;t die. No man
<PB N="38" REF="028752_0266_0FDBF21DD6E8FD80">
knows how &s;oon. It &s;urely is not wor&s;e to en|counter the king of terrors in health and with every advantage for the collection of fortitude, than to encounter him already half &s;ubdued by &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;uffering. I was re&s;olved at lea&s;t fully to po&s;|&s;e&s;s the days I had to live, and this is peculiarly in the power of the man who pre&s;erves his health to the la&s;t moment of his exi&s;tence. Why &s;hould I &s;uffer my mind to be invaded by unavailing re|grets? Every &s;entiment of vanity, or rather of independence and ju&s;tice within me, in&s;tigated me to &s;ay to my per&s;ecutor, You may cut off my ex|i&s;tence, but you cannot di&s;turb my &s;erenity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of the&s;e reflections another thought, which had not before &s;truck me, occurred to my mind. I exult, &s;aid I, and rea&s;onably, over the impotence of my per&s;ecutor. Is not that impo|tence greater than I have yet imagined? I &s;ay, he may cut off my exi&s;tence, but cannot di&s;turb my &s;erenity. It is true: my mind, the clearne&s;s of my &s;pirit, the firmne&s;s of my temper, are be|yond his reach; is not my life equally &s;o, if I plea&s;e? What are the material ob&s;tacles that man never &s;ubdued? What is the undertaking &s;o ar|duous that by &s;ome has not been accompli&s;hed? And, if by others, why not by me? Had they &s;tronger motives than I? Was exi&s;tence more va|riou&s;ly endeared to them, or had they more nu|merous methods by which to animate and adorn it? Many of tho&s;e who have exerted mo&s;t per&s;e|verance and intrepidity were obviou&s;ly my inferiors in that re&s;pect. Why &s;hould not I be as daring as they? Adamant and &s;teel have a ductility like water to a mind &s;ufficiently bold and contemplative. The mind is its own place; and is endowed with pow|ers that might enable it to laugh at the tyrant's vigilance. I pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed the&s;e ideas in my mind; and, heated with the contemplation, I &s;aid, No, I will not die!</P>
<P>My reading in early youth had been extremely mi&s;cellaneous. I had read of hou&s;ebreakers to whom locks and bolts were a je&s;t, and who, vain of their art, exhibited the experiment of entering
<PB N="40" REF="028752_0268_0FDBF2241BCE9F30">
a hou&s;e the mo&s;t &s;trongly barricaded, with as little noi&s;e and almo&s;t as little trouble as other men would lift up a latch. This circum&s;tance had caught my attention. There is nothing &s;o intere&s;t|ing to the juvenile mind as the wonderful; there is no power that it &s;o eagerly covets as that of a&s;toni&s;hing &s;pectators by its miraculous exertions. Mind appeared to my untutored reflections vague, airy and unfettered, the &s;u&s;ceptible perceiver of rea&s;ons, but never intended by nature to be the &s;lave of force. Why &s;hould it be in the power of man to overtake and hold me by force? Why, when I choo&s;e to withdraw my&s;elf, &s;hould I not be capable of eluding the mo&s;t vigilant &s;earch? The&s;e limbs and this trunk are a cumbrous and unfor|tunate load for the power of thinking to drag along with it; but why &s;hould not the power of thinking be able to lighten the load till it &s;hall be no longer felt?&mdash;The&s;e early modes of reflection were by no means indifferent to my pre&s;ent enquiries.</P>
<P>Our next-door neighbour at my father's hou&s;e had been a carpenter. Fre&s;h from the &s;ort of reading, I have mentioned, I was eager to examine his tools, their powers and their u&s;es. This car|penter was a man of a &s;trong and vigorous mind; and, his faculties having been chiefly confined to the range of his profe&s;&s;ion, he was fertile in expe|riments and ingenious in rea&s;oning upon the&s;e particular topics. I therefore obtained from him con&s;iderable &s;atisfaction; and, my mind being &s;et in action, I &s;ometimes even improved upon the hints he furni&s;hed. His conver&s;ation was particu|larly agreeable to me; I at fir&s;t worked with him &s;ometimes for my amu&s;ement, and afterwards occa|&s;ionally for a &s;hort time as his journeyman. I was con&s;titutionally vigorous, my bones well knit, and my limbs &s;inewy and powerful; and by the expe|rience
<PB N="41" REF="028752_0269_0FDBF2251882BFF0">
thus attained I added to the ab&s;tract po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of power the &s;kill of applying it, when I plea&s;ed, in &s;uch a manner as that no part &s;hould be inefficient.</P>
<P>It is a &s;trange, but no uncommon feature in the human mind, that the very re&s;ource of which we &s;tand in greate&s;t need in a critical &s;ituation, though already accumulated it may be by preceding in|du&s;try, fails to pre&s;ent it&s;elf at the time when it &s;hould be called into action. Thus my mind had pa&s;&s;ed through two very different &s;tages &s;ince my impri&s;onment, before this means of liberation &s;ug|ge&s;ted it&s;elf. My faculties were overwhelmed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and rai&s;ed to a pitch of enthu|&s;ia&s;m in the &s;econd, while in both I took it for granted in a manner that I mu&s;t pa&s;&s;ively &s;ubmit to the good plea&s;ure of my per&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>During the period in which my mind had been thus undecided, the a&s;&s;izes, which were held twice a year in the town in which I was a pri&s;oner, came on. Upon this occa&s;ion my ca&s;e was not brought forward, but was &s;uffered to &s;tand over &s;ix months longer. It would have been ju&s;t the &s;ame, if I had had as &s;trong rea&s;on to expect acquittal, as I had conviction. If I had been apprehended upon the mo&s;t frivolous rea&s;ons upon which any ju&s;tice of the peace ever thought proper to commit a naked beggar for trial, I mu&s;t &s;till have waited about two hundred and &s;eventeen days, before my innocence could be cleared. So imperfect are the effects of the boa&s;ted laws of a country who&s;e legi&s;lators hold their a&s;&s;embly from four to &s;ix months in every year! I never certainly di&s;cover|ed whether this delay were owing to any inter|ference on the part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f my pro&s;ecutor, or whether it fell out in the regular admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oo &s;olemn and dignified to accommodate
<PB N="42" REF="028752_0270_0FDBD6CF3805F310">
it&s;elf to the rights or benefit of an in&s;ignificant individual.</P>
<P>The term of my impri&s;onment was thus unac|countably prolonged. But this was not the only incident that occurred to me during my confine|ment for which I could find no &s;atisfactory &s;olu|tion. It was nearly at the &s;ame time, that is, when I had been little more than a month in durance, that the keeper began to alter his behaviour to me. He &s;ent for me one morning into the part of the building which was appropriated for his own u&s;e, and after &s;ome he&s;itation told me he was &s;orry my accommodations had been &s;o indifferent, and a&s;ked whether I &s;hould like to have a chamber in his family? I was &s;truck with the unexpectedne&s;s of this que&s;tion, and de&s;ired to know whether any body had employed him to a&s;k it. No, he replied; but, now the a&s;&s;izes were over, he had fewer felons on his hands, and more time to look about him: He believed I was a good kind of a young man; and he had taken a &s;ort of a liking to me. I fixed my eye upon his countenance as he &s;aid this. I could di&s;cover none of the u&s;ual &s;ymp|toms of kindne&s;s; he appeared to me to be acting a part, unnatural and that &s;at with aukwardne&s;s upon him. He went on however to offer me the liberty of eating at his table, which, if I cho&s;e it, he &s;aid would make no difference to him, and he &s;hould not think of charging me any thing for it. He had always indeed as much upon his hands as one per&s;on could &s;ee to; but his wife and his daughter Peggy would be woundily plea&s;ed to hear a per&s;on of learning talk, as he under&s;tood I was; and perhaps I might not feel my&s;elf di&s;agreeable in their company.</P>
<P>I reflected on this propo&s;al, and had little doubt, notwith&s;tanding what the keeper had affirmed to
<PB N="43" REF="028752_0271_0FDBF1E90AE93680">
the contrary, that it did not proceed from any &s;pontaneous humanity in him, but that he had, to &s;peak the language of per&s;ons of his ca&s;t, good rea&s;ons for what he did. I bu&s;ied my&s;elf in con|jectures as to who could be the author of this &s;ort of indulgence and attention. The two mo&s;t likely per&s;ons were Mr. Falkland and Mr. Fore&s;ter. The latter I knew to be a man au&s;tere and inexorable towards tho&s;e whom he deemed vicious. He piqued him&s;elf upon being in&s;en&s;ible to tho&s;e &s;ofter emo|tions, which he believed to an&s;wer no other pur|po&s;e than to &s;educe us from our duty. Mr. Falk|land on the contrary was a man of the acute&s;t &s;en|&s;ibility; hence aro&s;e his plea&s;ures and his pains, his virtues and his vices. Though he were the bittere&s;t enemy to whom I could po&s;&s;ibly be ex|po&s;ed, and though no &s;entiments of humanity could divert or controul the bent of his mind, I yet per|&s;uaded my&s;elf that he was more likely than his kin&s;man to vi&s;it in idea the &s;cene of my dungeon, and to feel impelled to alleviate my &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>This conjecture was by no means calculated to &s;erve as balm to my mind. My thoughts were unavoidably full of irritation again&s;t my per&s;ecutor. How could I think kindly of a man, in compe|tition with the gratification of who&s;e ruling pa&s;&s;ion my good name or my life was deemed as of no con&s;ideration? I &s;aw him cru&s;hing the one and bringing the other into jeopardy, with a quietne&s;s and compo&s;ure on his part that I could not recol|lect without horror. I knew not what were his plans re&s;pecting me. I knew not whether he trou|bled him&s;elf &s;o much as to form a barren wi&s;h for the pre&s;ervation of one, who&s;e future pro&s;pects he had &s;o iniquitou&s;ly tarni&s;hed. I had hitherto been &s;ilent as to my principal topic of recrimination. But I was by no means certain that I &s;hould con|&s;ent
<PB N="44" REF="028752_0272_0FDBF239C95D8D70">
to go out of the world in &s;ilence, the victim of this man's obduracy and art. In every view I felt my heart ulcerated with a &s;en&s;e of his inju&s;|tice; and my very &s;oul &s;purned the&s;e pitiful indul|gences, at a time that he was grinding me into du&s;t with the inexorablene&s;s of his vengeance.</P>
<P>I was influenced by the&s;e &s;entiments in my re|ply to the jailor; and I found a &s;ecret plea&s;ure in pronouncing them in all their bitterne&s;s. I viewed him with a &s;arca&s;tic &s;mile, and &s;aid, I was glad to find him of a &s;udden become &s;o humane: I was not however without &s;ome penetration as to the humanity of a jailor, and could gue&s;s at the cir|cum&s;tances by which it was produced. But he might tell his employer that his cares were fruit|le&s;s; I would accept no favours from a man that held a halter about my neck, and had courage enough to endure the wor&s;t both in time to come and now.&mdash;The jailor looked at me with a&s;toni&s;h|ment, and, turning upon his heel, exclaimed, Well done, my cock! You have not had your learning for nothing I &s;ee. You are &s;et upon not dying dunghill. But that is to come, lad: you had better by half keep your courage till you &s;hall find it wanted.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;izes, which pa&s;&s;ed over without influence to me, produced a great revolution among my fellow pri&s;oners. I lived long enough in the jail to witne&s;s a general mutation of its inhabitants. One of the hou&s;ebreakers and the coiner were hanged. Two more were ca&s;t for tran&s;portation, and the re&s;t acquitted. The tran&s;ports remained with us; and, though the pri&s;on was thus lighten|ed of nine of its inhabitants, I left within three as many per&s;ons on the felons' &s;ide as I had found there on my fir&s;t arrival.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="028752_0273_0FDBF1EBF5310120">
The &s;oldier, who&s;e &s;tory I have already record|ed, died, on the evening of the very day on which the judges arrived, of a di&s;ea&s;e the con&s;equence of his confinement. Such was the ju&s;tice that re|&s;ulted from the laws of his country, to an indivi|dual who would have been the ornament of any age, one who of all the men I ever knew was in|expre&s;&s;ibly the kinde&s;t, of the mo&s;t feeling heart, of the mo&s;t engaging and unaffected manners, and the mo&s;t unblemi&s;hed life. The name of this man was Brightwel. Were it po&s;&s;ible for my pen to con&s;ecrate him to never dying fame, I could un|dertake no ta&s;k more grateful to my heart. His judgment was penetrating and manly, totally un|mixed with imbecility and confu&s;ion, while at the &s;ame time there was &s;uch an uncontending frank|ne&s;s in his countenance, that a &s;uperficial ob&s;erver would have &s;uppo&s;ed he mu&s;t have been the prey of the fir&s;t plau&s;ible knavery that was practi&s;ed again&s;t him. Great rea&s;on have I to remember him with affection! He was the mo&s;t ardent, and I had almo&s;t &s;aid the la&s;t of my friends. Nor did I remain in this re&s;pect in his debt. There was indeed a great congeniality, if I may pre&s;ume to &s;ay &s;o, in our characters, except that I cannot pre|tend to rival the magnitude of his genius, or to compare with, what the world has &s;carcely &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed, the correctne&s;s and untainted purity of his conduct. He heard my &s;tory, as far as I thought proper to di&s;clo&s;e it, with intere&s;t, he examined it with &s;incere impartiality, and, if at fir&s;t any doubt remained upon his mind, a frequent ob&s;ervation of me in my mo&s;t unguarded moments taught him in no long time to place an unre&s;erved confidence in my innocence.</P>
<P>He talked of the inju&s;tice of which we were mutually victims without bitterne&s;s, and predicted
<PB N="46" REF="028752_0274_0FDBF22BD3D13630">
that the time would come when the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch intolerable oppre&s;&s;ion would be extirpated. But this, he &s;aid, was a happine&s;s re&s;erved for po&s;te|rity; it was too late for us to reap the benefit of it. It was &s;ome con&s;olation to him, that he could not tell the period in his pa&s;t life, which the be&s;t judg|ment of which he was capable would teach him to &s;pend better. He could &s;ay, with as much rea&s;on as mo&s;t men, he had di&s;charged his duty. But he fore&s;aw that he &s;hould not &s;urvive his pre&s;ent cala|mity. This was his prediction, while yet in his health. He might be &s;aid in a certain &s;en&s;e to have a broken heart. But, if that phra&s;e were in any way applicable to him, &s;ure never was de&s;pair more calm, more full of re&s;ignation and &s;erenity.</P>
<P>At no time in the whole cour&s;e of my adven|tures was I expo&s;ed to a &s;hock more &s;evere than I received from this man's death. The circum&s;tan|ces of his fate pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my mind in their full complication of iniquity. From him and the execrations with which I loaded the government that could be the in&s;trument of his tragedy, I turned to my&s;elf. I beheld the cata&s;trophe of Brightwel with envy. A thou&s;and times I longed that my cor&s;e had laid in death, in&s;tead of his. I was only re&s;erved, as I per&s;uaded my&s;elf, for un|utterable woe. In a few days he would have been acquitted, his liberty, his reputation re&s;tored; man|kind perhaps, &s;truck with the inju&s;tice he had &s;uf|fered, would have &s;hown them&s;elves eager to ba|lance his misfortunes and obliterate his di&s;grace. But this man died; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> remained alive! I, who, though not le&s;s wrongfully treated than he, had no hope of reparation, mu&s;t be marked as long I lived for a villain, and in my death probably held up to the &s;corn and dete&s;tation of my &s;pecies!</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="028752_0275_0FDBF1ECD52EC678">
Such were &s;ome of the immediate reflections which the fate of this unfortunate martyr produced in my mind. Yet my intercour&s;e with Brightwel was not in the review without its portion of com|fort. I &s;aid, This man has &s;een through the veil of calumny that over&s;hades me; he has under|&s;tood, and has loved me. Why &s;hould I de&s;pair? May I not meet hereafter with men ingenuous like him, who &s;hall do me ju&s;tice and &s;ympathi&s;e with my calamity? With that con&s;olation I will be &s;a|tisfied. I will re&s;t in the arms of friend&s;hip, and forget the malignity of the world. Henceforth I will be contented with tranquil ob&s;curity, with the cultivation of &s;entiment and wi&s;dom, and the ex|erci&s;e of benevolence within a narrow circle. It was thus that my mind became excited to the pro|ject I was about to undertake.</P>
<P>I had no &s;ooner meditated the idea of an e&s;cape, than I determined upon the following method of facilitating the preparations for it. I undertook to ingratiate my&s;elf with my keeper. In the world I have generally &s;ound &s;uch per&s;ons as had been acquainted with the outline of my &s;tory, regarding me with a &s;ort of loathing and abhorrence, which made them avoid me with as much care as if I had been &s;potted with the plague. The idea of my having fir&s;t robbed my ma&s;ter, and then endea|voured to clear my&s;elf by charging him with &s;ub|ornation again&s;t me, placed me in a cla&s;s di&s;tinct from and infinitely more guilty than that of com|mon felons. But this man was too good a ma&s;ter of his profe&s;&s;ion to entertain aver&s;ion again&s;t a fel|low creature upon &s;uch a &s;core. He con&s;idered the per&s;ons committed to his cu&s;tody merely as &s;o many human bodies for whom he was re&s;pon&s;ible that they &s;hould be forthcoming in time and place; and the difference of innocence and guilt he looked
<PB N="48" REF="028752_0276_0FDBF22D52899EE8">
down upon as an affair beneath his attention. I had not therefore the prejudices to encounter in recommending my&s;elf to him, that I have found &s;o peculiarly ob&s;tinate in many other ca&s;es. Add to which, the &s;ame motive, whatever it was, that had made him &s;o profu&s;e in his offers a little be|fore, had probably its influence on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>I informed him of my &s;kill in the profe&s;&s;ion of a joiner, and offered to make him half a dozen hand|&s;ome chairs, if he would facilitate my obtaining the tools nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on my profe&s;&s;ion in my pre&s;ent confinement; for, without his con&s;ent pre|viou&s;ly obtained, it would have been in vain for me to expect that I could quietly exert an indu&s;try of this kind, even if my exi&s;tence had depended upon it. He looked at me fir&s;t as a&s;king him&s;elf what he was to under&s;tand by this novel propo&s;al, and then, mo&s;t graciou&s;ly relaxing, &s;aid, he was glad I was come off a little of my high notions and my buckram, and he would &s;ee what he could do. Two days after he &s;ignified his compliance. He &s;aid that, as to the matter of the pre&s;ent I had offered him, he thought nothing of that, I might do as I plea&s;ed in it; but I might depend upon every civility from him that he could &s;how with &s;afety to him&s;elf, if &s;o be as, when he was civil, I did not offer a &s;econd time to &s;nap and take him up &s;hort.</P>
<P>Having thus gained my preliminary, I gradu|ally accumulated tools or various &s;orts, gimlets, piercers, chi&s;&s;els, <HI>et cetera.</HI> I immediately &s;et my&s;elf to work. The nights were long, and the &s;ordid eagerne&s;s of my keeper notwith&s;tanding his o&s;tentatious genero&s;ity was great; I therefore petitioned and was indulged with a bit of, candle that I might amu&s;e my&s;elf for an hour or two with
<PB N="49" REF="028752_0277_0FDBF1F170D71510">
my work after I was locked up in my dungeon. I did not however by any means apply con&s;tantly to the work I had undertaken, and my jailor betrayed various tokens of impatience. Perhaps he was afraid I &s;hould not have fini&s;hed it before I was hanged. I however in&s;i&s;ted upon working at my lei&s;ure as I plea&s;ed, and this he did not venture expre&s;sly to di&s;pute. In addition to the advan|tages thus obtained, I procured &s;ecretly from Mi&s;s Peggy, who now and then came into the jail to make her ob&s;ervations of the pri&s;oners, and who &s;eemed to have conceived &s;ome partiality for my per&s;on, the implement of an iron crow.</P>
<P>In the&s;e proceedings it is ea&s;y to trace the vice and duplicity that mu&s;t be expected to grow out of inju&s;tice. I know not whether my readers will pardon the &s;ini&s;ter advantage I extracted from the my&s;terious conce&s;&s;ions of my keeper. But I mu&s;t acknowledge my weakne&s;s in that re&s;pect; I am writing my adventures and not my apology: and I was not prepared to maintain the unvaried &s;ince|rity of my manners, at the expence of a &s;peedy clo&s;e to be put upon my exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>My plan was now dige&s;ted. I believed that by means of the crow I could ea&s;ily and without much noi&s;e force the door of my dungeon from its hinges, or, if not, that I could, in ca&s;e of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, cut away the lock. This door led into a narrow pa&s;&s;age, bounded on one &s;ide by the range of dungeons, and on the other by the jailor's and turnkey's apartments, through which was the u&s;ual entrance from the &s;treet. This outlet I dared not attempt for fear of di&s;turbing the per&s;ons clo&s;e to who&s;e very door I &s;hould in that ca&s;e have found it nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s. I determined therefore upon another door at the farther end of the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ge, which was barricaded, and which led to a &s;ort of
<PB N="50" REF="028752_0278_0FDBF231D1498D68">
a garden in the occupation of the keeper. This gar|den I had never entered, but I had had an opportu|nity of ob&s;erving it from the window of the felons' day room, which looked that way, the room it&s;elf being immediately over the range of dungeons. I perceived that it was bounded by a wall of con&s;i|derable height, which I was told by my fellow pri|&s;oners was the extremity of the jail on that &s;ide, and beyond which was a back-lane of &s;ome length that terminated upon the &s;kirts of the town. Upon an accurate ob&s;ervation and much reflection upon the &s;ubject I found that I &s;hould be able, if once I got into the garden, with my gimblets and piercers in&s;erted at proper di&s;tances to make a &s;ort of lad|der, by means of which I could get clear over the wall, and once more take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;weets of liberty. I preferred this wall to that which im|mediately &s;kirted my dungeon, on the other &s;ide of which was a populous &s;treet.</P>
<P>I &s;uffered about two days to elap&s;e from the pe|riod at which I had thoroughly dige&s;ted my pro|ject, and then in the very middle of the night be|gan to &s;et about its execution. The fir&s;t door was attended with con&s;iderable difficulty, but at length this ob&s;tacle was happily removed. The &s;econd door was fa&s;tened on the in&s;ide. I was therefore able with perfect ea&s;e to pu&s;h back the bolts. But the lock, which of cour&s;e was depended upon for the principal &s;ecurity, and was therefore &s;trong, was double-&s;hot, and the key taken away. I en|deavoured with my chi&s;&s;el to force back the bolt of the lock, but to no purpo&s;e. I then un&s;crewed the box of the lock; and, that being taken away, the door was no longer oppo&s;ed to my wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Thus far I had proceeded with the happie&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;s, but clo&s;e on the other &s;ide of the door there was a kennel with a large ma&s;tiff dog, of which I
<PB N="51" REF="028752_0279_0FDBF2342F3CD988">
had not the &s;malle&s;t previous knowledge. Though I &s;tepped along in the mo&s;t careful manner, this animal was di&s;turbed and began to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ark. I was extremely di&s;concerted, but immediately applied my&s;elf to &s;oothe the animal, in which I pre&s;ently &s;ucceeded. I then returned along the pa&s;&s;age to li&s;ten whether any body had been di&s;turbed by the noi&s;e of the dog; re&s;olved, if that were the ca&s;e, that I would return to my dungeon, and endeavour to replace every thing in its former &s;tate. But the whole appeared perfectly quiet, and I was encou|raged to proceed in my operation.</P>
<P>I now got to the wall, and had nearly gained half the a&s;cent, when I heard a voice at the garden door, crying, Holloa! who is there? who opened the door? The man received no an&s;wer, and the night was too dark for him to di&s;tingui&s;h objects at any di&s;tance. He therefore returned, as I judged, into the hou&s;e for a light. Meantime the dog, un|der&s;tanding the key in which the&s;e interrogations were uttered, began barking again more violently than ever. I had now no po&s;&s;ibility of retreat, and I was not without hopes that I might yet ac|compli&s;h my object, and clear the wall. Mean|while a &s;econd man came out, while the other was getting his lanthorn, and, by that time, I had got to the top of the wall, was able to perceive me. He immediately &s;et up a &s;hout, and threw a large &s;tone which grazed me in its flight. Alarmed at my &s;ituation, I was obliged to de&s;cend on the other &s;ide without taking the nece&s;&s;ary precautions, and in my fall nearly di&s;located my ancle.</P>
<P>There was a door in the wall, of which I was not previou&s;ly appri&s;ed; and, this being opened, the two men with the lanthorn were on the other &s;ide in an in&s;tant. They had then nothing to do but to run along the lane to the place from which I
<PB N="52" REF="028752_0280_0FDBF2CC5722DDE8">
had de&s;cended. I endeavoured to ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e after my fall, but the pain was &s;o inten&s;e that I was &s;carcely able to &s;tand, and, after having limped a few paces, I twi&s;ted my foot under me, and fell down again. I had now no remedy, and quietly &s;uffered my&s;elf to be retaken.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS conducted to the keeper's room for that night, and the two men &s;at up with me. I was acco&s;ted with many interrogatories, to which I gave little an&s;wer, but complained of the hurt in my leg. To this I could obtain no reply except, Cur&s;e you, my lad! if that be all, we will give you &s;ome ointment for that; we will anoint it with a little cold iron. They were indeed exce&s;&s;ively <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ulky with me, for having broken their night's re&s;t and given them all this trouble. In the morning they were as good as their word, fixing a pair of fetters upon both my legs, regardle&s;s of the ancle which was now &s;welled to a con&s;iderable &s;ize, and then fa&s;tening me with a padlock to a &s;taple in the floor of my dungeon. I expo&s;tulated with warmth upon this treatment, told them that I was a man upon whom the law had as yet pa&s;&s;ed no cen&s;ure, and who therefore in the eye of the law was inno|cent. But they bid me keep &s;uch fudge as that for people who knew no better; that they knew what they did, and would an&s;wer it to any court in Eng|land.</P>
<P>The pain of the fetter was intolerable. I en|deavoured in various ways to relieve it, and even privily to free my leg; but the more it was &s;welled, the more was this rendered impo&s;&s;ible. I then re&s;olved to bear it with patience; &s;till the longer it continued, the wor&s;e it grew. After two days and two nights I entreated the turnkey to go and a&s;k the &s;urgeon who u&s;ually attended the pri&s;on
<PB N="54" REF="028752_0282_0FDBF23AD2190A98">
to look at it, for, if it continued longer as it was, I was convinced it would mortify. But he glared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">lily at me, and &s;aid, Damn my blood! I &s;hould like to &s;ee that day. To die of a mortification is too good an end for &s;uch a ra&s;cal! At the time that he thus addre&s;&s;ed me, the whole ma&s;s of my blood was already fevered by the angui&s;h I had un|dergone, my patience was wholly exhau&s;ted, and I was &s;illy enough to be irritated beyond bearing by his impertinence and vulgarity. Look you, Mr. turnkey, &s;aid I, there is one thing that &s;uch fellows as you are &s;et over us for, and another thing that you are not. You are to take care we do not e&s;|cape, but it is no part of your office to call us names and abu&s;e us. If I were not chained down to my &s;eat, you dare as well eat your fingers as u&s;e &s;uch language; and, take my word for it, you &s;hall yet live to repent of your in&s;olence.</P>
<P>While I thus &s;poke, the man &s;tared at me with a&s;toni&s;hment. He was &s;o little accu&s;tomed to &s;uch retorts that at fir&s;t he could &s;carcely believe his ears; and &s;uch was the firmne&s;s of my manner that he &s;eemed to forget for a moment that I was not at large. But, as &s;oon as he had time to recol|lect him&s;elf, he did not deign even to be angry. His face relaxed into a &s;mile of contempt, he &s;nap|ped his fingers at me, and, turning upon his heel, exclaimed, Well &s;aid, my cock, Crow away! Have a care you do not bur&s;t! and, as he &s;hut the door upon me, mimicked the voice of the animal he mentioned.</P>
<P>This rejoinder brought me to my&s;elf in a mo|ment, and &s;howed me the impotence of the re&s;ent|ment I was expre&s;&s;ing. But, though he thus put an end to the violence of my &s;peech, the torture of my body continued as great as ever. I was de|termined to change my mode of attack. The &s;ame turnkey returned in a few minutes; and, as he ap|proached
<PB N="55" REF="028752_0283_0FDBF28365FE5D38">
me to put down &s;ome food he had brought I &s;lipped a &s;hilling into his hand, &s;aying at the &s;ame time, My good fellow, for God's &s;ake, go to the &s;urgeon: I am &s;ure you do not wi&s;h me to peri&s;h for want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The fellow put the &s;hilling in his pocket, looked hard at me, and then with one nod of his head, and without uttering a &s;ingle word, went away. The &s;urgeon pre&s;ently after made his appearance; and, finding the part in a high &s;tate of inflammation, ordered certain appli|cations, and gave peremptory directions that the fetter &s;hould not be replaced upon that leg, till a cure had been effected. It was a full month be|fore the leg was perfectly healed, and made equally &s;trong and flexible with the other.</P>
<P>The condition in which I was now placed was totally different from that which had preceded this attempt. I was chained all day in my dungeon, except that the door was regularly opened for a few hours, at which time &s;ome of the pri&s;oners occa&s;ionally came and &s;poke to me, and particu|larly one, who, though he could ill replace my be|loved Brightwel, was innocent, guilele&s;s and bene|volent. This was no other than the individual whom Mr. Falkland had &s;ome months before di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed upon an accu&s;ation of murder. My manual labours were now at an end; my dungeon was &s;earched every night, and every kind of tool care|fully kept from me. The &s;traw which has been hitherto allowed me was removed, under pretence that it was adapted for concealment; and the only conveniences with which I was indulged were a chair and a blanket.</P>
<P>A pro&s;pect of &s;ome alleviation in no long time opened upon me; but this my u&s;ual ill fortune rendered abortive. The keeper once more made his appearance, and with his former uncon&s;tituti|onal and ambiguous humanity. He pretended to

be &s;urpri&s;ed at my want of every accommodation. He reprehended in &s;trong terms my attempt to e&s;cape, and ob&s;erved that there mu&s;t be an end of civility from people in his &s;ituation, if gentlemen after all would not know when they were well. It was nece&s;&s;ary in ca&s;es the like of this to let the law take its cour&s;e, and it would be ridiculous i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> me to complain, if after a regular trial things &s;hould go hard with me.

But my meditations in this ca&s;e were vain. The keeper returned no more during the remainder of that day, and on the next an incident occurred which put an end to all expectations from his kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>An active mind, which has once been forced into any particular train, can &s;carcely be per&s;uad|ed to de&s;ert it as hopele&s;s. I had &s;tudied my chains during the extreme angui&s;h that I endured from the pre&s;&s;ure of the fetter upon the ancle which had been &s;prained; and, though from the &s;welling and acute &s;en&s;ibility of the part I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound all attempts at relief in that in&s;tance imprac|ticable, I obtained from the clo&s;ene&s;s of my in|ve&s;tigation another and apparently &s;uperior advan|tage. During the night my dungeon was in a &s;tate of complete darkne&s;s; but, when the door was open, the ca&s;e was &s;omewhat different. The pa&s;&s;age indeed into which it opened was &s;o narrow, and the oppo&s;ite dead wall &s;o near, that it was but
<PB N="57" REF="028752_0285_0FDBF284524BFD90">
a glimmering and melancholy light that entered my apartment, even at full noon, and when the door was as its wide&s;t extent. But my eyes, after a practice of two or three weeks, accommodated them&s;elves to this circum&s;tance, and I learned to di&s;tingui&s;h the minute&s;t objects. One day, as I was alternately meditating and examining the ob|jects around me, I chanced to ob&s;erve a nail trod|den into the mud floor at no great di&s;tance from me. I immediately conceived the de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing my&s;elf of this implement; but, for fear of &s;urpri&s;e, people pa&s;&s;ing perpetually to and fro, I contented my&s;elf for the pre&s;ent with remarking its &s;ituation &s;o accurately, that I might ea&s;ily find it again in the dark. Accordingly, as &s;oon as my door was &s;hut, I &s;eized upon this new trea&s;ure, and, having contrived to fa&s;hion it to my purpo&s;e, found that I could unlock with it the padlock that fa&s;tened me to the &s;taple in the floor. This I re|garded as no incon&s;iderable advantage, &s;eparately from the u&s;e I might derive from it in relation to my principal object. My chain permitted me to move only about eighteen inches to the right or left; and, having borne this confinement for &s;eve|ral weeks, my very heart leaped at the pitiful con|&s;olation of being able to range without con&s;traint, the mi&s;erable coop in which I was immured. This incident had occurred &s;everal days previous to the la&s;t vi&s;it of my keeper.</P>
<P>From this time it had been my con&s;tant practice to liberate my&s;elf every night, and not to replace things in their former &s;ituation, till I awoke in the morning, and expected &s;hortly to perceive the en|trance of the turnkey. Security breeds negligence. It was on the morning &s;ucceeding my conference with the jailor that, whether I over&s;lept my&s;elf, or the turnkey went his round earlier than u&s;ual, I
<PB N="58" REF="028752_0286_0FDBF2419196A3C8">
was rou&s;ed from my &s;leep by the noi&s;e he made in opening the cell next to my own; and, though I exerted the utmo&s;t diligence, yet having to grope for my materials in the dark, I was unable to fa&s;ten the chain to the &s;taple, before he entered as u&s;ual with his lanthorn. He was extremely &s;urpri&s;ed to find me thus di&s;engaged, and immediately &s;um|moned the principal keeper. I was que&s;tioned re|&s;pecting my method of proceeding; and, as I be|lieved concealment could lead to nothing but a &s;everer &s;earch and a more accurate watch, I readily acquainted them with the exact truth. The illu&s;|trious per&s;onage who&s;e function it was to controul the inhabitants of the&s;e walls, was by this la&s;t in|&s;tance completely exa&s;perated again&s;t me. Arti|fice and fair &s;peaking were at an end. His eyes &s;parkling with fury, he exclaimed, that he was now convinced of the folly of &s;howing kindne&s;s to ra&s;cals, the &s;cum of the earth, &s;uch as I was; and, damn him, if any body &s;hould catch him at that again towards any one. I had cured him effec|tually! He was a&s;toni&s;hed that the laws had not provided &s;ome terrible retaliation for thieves that attempted to deceive their jailors. Hanging was a thou&s;and times too good for me!</P>
<P>Having vented his indignation, he proceeded to give &s;uch orders as the united in&s;tigations of anger and alarm &s;ugge&s;ted to his mind. My apartment was changed. I was conducted to a room called the &s;trong room, the door of which opened into the middle cell of the range of dungeons. It was under-ground as they were, and had over it the day room for felons already de&s;cribed. It was &s;pacious and dreary. The door had not been opened for years; the air was putrid; and the walls hung round with damps and mildew. The fetters, the padlock, and the &s;taple were employed
<PB N="59" REF="028752_0287_0FDBF28B442A9AC8">
as in the former ca&s;e, in addition to which they put on me a pair of hand-cuffs. For my fir&s;t pro|vi&s;ion the keeper &s;ent me nothing but a bit of bread, mouldy and black, and &s;ome dirty and &s;tinking water. I know not indeed whether this is to be regarded as gratuitous tyranny on the part of the jailor; the law having providently directed in certain ca&s;es, that the water to be admini&s;tered to the pri&s;oners, &s;hall be taken from "the next &s;ink or puddle neare&s;t to the jail."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State Trials, Vol. I. anno 1615.</NOTE> It was far|ther ordered that one of the turnkeys &s;hould &s;leep in the cell that formed a &s;ort of antichamber to my apartment. Though every convenience was provided, to render this chamber fit for the recep|tion of a per&s;onage, of a dignity &s;o &s;uperior to the felon he was appointed to guard, he expre&s;&s;ed much di&s;&s;atisfaction at the mandate: but there was no alternative.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation to which I was thus removed was apparently the mo&s;t unde&s;irable that could be ima|gined; but I was not di&s;couraged. I had for &s;ome time learned not to judge by appearances. The apartment was dank and unwhole&s;ome; but I had acquired the &s;ecret of counteracting&punc; the&s;e in|fluences. My door was kept continually &s;hut, and the other pri&s;oners were debarred acce&s;s to me. But, if the intercour&s;e of our fellow men has its plea&s;ures, &s;olitude on the other hand is not with|out its advantages&punc; In &s;olitude we can pur&s;ue our own thoughts undi&s;turbed; and I was able to call up at will the mo&s;t plea&s;ing avocations. Be&s;ide which, to one who meditated &s;uch de&s;igns as now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">illed my mind, &s;olitude had peculiar recommen|dations. I was &s;carcely left to my&s;elf before I tried an experiment the idea of which I conceived
<PB N="60" REF="028752_0288_0FDBF246D9625250">
while they were fixing my hand-cuffs; and, with my teeth only, di&s;engaged my&s;elf from this re|&s;traint. The hours at which I was vi&s;ited by the keepers were regular, and I took care to be pro|vided for them. Add to which, I had a narrow grated window near the cieling, about nine inches in perpendicular, and a foot and a half in width, which, though &s;mall, admitted a much &s;tronger light, than that to which I had been accu&s;tomed for &s;everal weeks. Thus circum&s;tanced, I &s;carcely ever found my&s;elf in total darkne&s;s, and was better provided again&s;t &s;urpri&s;es, than I had been in my preceding &s;ituation. Such were the &s;entiments which this change of abode immediately &s;ugge&s;t|ed.</P>
<P>I had been a very little time removed, when I received an unexpected vi&s;it from Thomas, Mr. Falk|land's valet, whom I have already more than once mentioned in the cour&s;e of my narrative. A &s;ervant of Mr. Fore&s;ter happened to come to the town where I was impri&s;oned, a few weeks before, while I was confined with the hurt in my ancle, and had called in to &s;ee me. The account he gave of what he ob&s;erved had been the &s;ource of many an unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation to Thomas. The former vi&s;it was a matter of mere curio&s;ity, but Thomas was of the better order of &s;ervants. He was con&s;iderably &s;truck at the &s;ight of me. Though my mind was now &s;erene, and my health &s;ufficiently good, yet the floridne&s;s of my complexion was gone, and there was a rudene&s;s in my phy&s;iognomy, the con|&s;equence of hard&s;hip and fortitude, extremely un|like the &s;leekne&s;s of my better days. Thomas looked alternately in my face, at my hands and my feet; and then fetched a deep &s;igh. After a pau&s;e:</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="028752_0289_0FDBF28C99AECC70">
Lord ble&s;s us! &s;aid he, in a voice in which com|mi&s;eration was &s;ufficiently perceptible, is this you?</P>
<P>Why not, Thomas? You knew I was &s;ent to pri&s;on, did not you?</P>
<P>Pri&s;on! and mu&s;t people in pri&s;on be &s;hackled and bound of that fa&s;hion?&mdash;And where do you lay of nights?</P>
<P>Here.</P>
<P>Here! Why there is no bed!</P>
<P>No, Thomas, I am not allowed a bed. I had &s;traw formerly, but that is taken away.</P>
<P>And do they take off them there things of nights?</P>
<P>No; I am expected to &s;leep ju&s;t as you &s;ee.</P>
<P>Sleep! Why I thought this was a Chri&s;tian country; but this u&s;age is too bad for a dog.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not &s;ay &s;o, Thomas. It is what the wi&s;dom of government has thought fit to provide.</P>
<P>Zounds, how I have been chou&s;ed! They told me what a fine thing it was to be an Engli&s;hman, and about liberty and property, and all that there; and I find it is all a flam. Lord, what fools we be! Things are done under our very no&s;es, and we know nothing of the matter; and a parcel of fellows with grave faces &s;wear to us that &s;uch things never happen but in France, and other coun|tries the like of that. Why, you han't been tried, ha' you?</P>
<P>No.</P>
<P>And what &s;ignifies being tried, when they do wor&s;e than hang a man, and all beforehand? Well, ma&s;ter Williams, you have been very wicked to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ure, and I thought it would have done me good to &s;ee you hanged. But, I do not know how it is, one's heart melts, and pity comes over one, if we take time to cool. I know that ought not to be; but, damn it, when I talked of your being hanged,
<PB N="62" REF="028752_0290_0FDBF24A92B9B380">
I did not think of your &s;uffering all this into the bargain.</P>
<P>Soon after this conver&s;ation Thomas left me. The idea of the long connexion of our families ru&s;hed upon his memory, and he felt more for my &s;ufferings at the moment than I did for my&s;elf. In the afternoon I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him again. He &s;aid, that he could not get the thought of me out of his mind, and therefore he hoped I would not be di&s;plea&s;ed at his coming once more to take leave of me. I could perceive that he had &s;ome|thing upon his mind, which he did not know how to di&s;charge. One of the turnkeys had each time come into the room with him, and continued as long as he &s;taid. Upon &s;ome avocation however, a noi&s;e I believe in the pa&s;&s;age, the turnkey went as far as the door to &s;atisfy his curio&s;ity; and Tho|mas, watching the opportunity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">pt into my hand a chi&s;&s;el, a file, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aw, exclaiming at the &s;ame time with a &s;orrowful tone. I know I am doing wrong; but, if they hang me too&punc; I cannot help it: I cannot do no other. For Chri&s;t's &s;ake, get out of this place; I cannot bear the thoughts of it!&mdash;I received the implements with great joy, and thru&s;t them into my bo&s;om; and, as &s;oon as he was gone, concealed them in the ru&s;hes of my chair. Meanwhile he had accompli&s;hed the object for which he came, and pre&s;ently after bade me farewel.</P>
<P>The next day the keepers, I know not for what rea&s;on, were more than u&s;ually indu&s;trious in their &s;earch, &s;aying, though without a&s;&s;igning any ground for their &s;u&s;picion, that they were &s;ure I had &s;ome tool in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that I ought not; but the de|po&s;itory I had cho&s;en e&s;caped them.</P>
<P>I waited from this time the greater part of a week that I might have the benefit of a bright
<PB N="63" REF="028752_0291_0FDBF22A84B7E6A8">
moon light. It was nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould work in the night; it was nece&s;&s;ary that my operations &s;hould be performed between the la&s;t vi&s;it of the keepers at night and their fir&s;t in the morning, that is, between nine in the evening and &s;even. In my dungeon, as I have already &s;aid, I pa&s;&s;ed fourteen or &s;ixteen hours of the four and twenty undi&s;|turbed; but, &s;ince I had acquired a character for mechanical ingenuity, a particular exception with re&s;pect to me was made from the general rules of the pri&s;on.</P>
<P>It was ten o'clock when I entered on my under|taking. The room in which I was confined was &s;ecured with a double door. This was totally &s;u|perfluous for the purpo&s;e of my detention, &s;ince there was a centinel planted on the out&s;ide. But it was very fortunate for my plan, becau&s;e the&s;e doors prevented the ea&s;y communication of &s;ound, and afforded me tolerable &s;atisfaction that with a little care in my mode of proceeding I might be &s;ecure again&s;t the danger of being overheard. I fir&s;t took off my hand-cuffs. I then filed through my fetters; and next performed the &s;ame &s;ervice to three of the iron bars that &s;ecured my window, to which I climbed partly by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my chair and partly by means of certain irregularities in the wall. All this was the work of more than two hours. When the bars were filed through, I ea&s;ily forced them a little from the perpendicular, and then drew them one by one out of the wall, into which they were &s;unk about three inches, per|fectly &s;trait, and without any precaution to prevent their being removed. But the &s;pace thus obtained was by no means wide enough to admit the pa&s;&s;ing of my body. I therefore applied my&s;elf partly with my chi&s;&s;el, and partly with one of the iron bars, to the loo&s;ening the brick work; and, when
<PB N="64" REF="028752_0292_0FDBF24C1328FFB0">
I had thus di&s;engaged four or five bricks, I got down and piled them upon the floor. This opera|tion I repeated three or four times. The &s;pace was now &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e, and having crept through the opening, I &s;tepped upon a &s;ort of &s;hed on the out&s;ide.</P>
<P>I was now in a kind of rude area between two dead walls, that &s;outh of the felons day room the windows of which were at the ea&s;t end, and the wall of the pri&s;on. But I had not, as formerly, any in&s;truments to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in &s;caling the wall which was of a con&s;iderable height. There was of con&s;equence no re&s;ource for me but that of ef|fecting a practicable breach in the lower part of the wall, which was of no contemptible &s;trength, being of &s;tone on the out&s;ide, with a facing of brick within. The rooms for the debtors were at right angles with the building from which I had ju&s;t e&s;caped; and, as the night was extremely bright, I was in momentary danger, particularly in ca&s;e of the lea&s;t noi&s;e, of being di&s;covered by them, &s;everal of their windows commanding the area. Thus circum&s;tanced, I determined to make the &s;hed an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of concealment. It was locked; but, with the broken link of my fet|ters, which I had had the precaution to bring with me, I found no great difficulty in opening the lock. I had now got a &s;ufficient means of hiding my per&s;on while I proceeded in my work, attended with no other di&s;advantage, than that of being obliged to leave the door through which I had thus broken, a little open for the &s;ake of light. After &s;ome time I had removed a con&s;iderable part of the brick work of the outer wall; but, when I came to the &s;tone, I found the undertaking infinitely more difficult. The mortar which bound together the building, was by length of time nearly petri|fied,
<PB N="65" REF="028752_0293_0FDBF293516110F0">
and appeared to my fir&s;t efforts one &s;olid rock of the harde&s;t adamant. I had now been &s;ix hours ince&s;&s;antly engaged in incredible labour; my chi&s;&s;el broke in the fir&s;t attempt upon this new ob|&s;tacle, and between fatigue already endured, and the &s;eemingly invincible difficulty before me, I concluded that I mu&s;t remain where I was, and that all I had hitherto effected would prove u&s;ele&s;s. At the &s;ame time the moon, who&s;e light had till now been of the greate&s;t u&s;e to me, &s;et, and I was left in total darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>After a re&s;pite of ten minutes however, I re|turned to the attack with new vigour. I could not be le&s;s than two hours before the fir&s;t &s;tone was loo&s;ened from the edifice. In one hour more the &s;pace was &s;ufficient to admit of my e&s;cape. The pile of bricks I had left in the &s;trong room was con&s;iderable. But it was a mole hill compared with the ruins I had forced from the outer wall. I am fully a&s;&s;ured that the work I had thus per|formed would have been to a common labourer with every advantage of tools the bu&s;ine&s;s of two or three days.</P>
<P>But my difficulties, in&s;tead of being ended, &s;eemed to be only begun. The day broke before I had completed the opening, and in ten minutes more the keepers would probably enter my apart|ment, and perceive the deva&s;tation I had left. The lane, which connected the &s;ide of the pri&s;on through which I had e&s;caped with the adjacent country, was formed chiefly by two dead walls, with here and there a &s;table, a few warehou&s;es and &s;ome mean habitations tenanted by the lower order of people. My be&s;t &s;ecurity lay in clearing the town as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and depending upon the open country for protection. My arms were intolerably &s;welled and brui&s;ed with my labour, and
<PB N="66" REF="028752_0294_0FDBF250F78F6B50">
my &s;trength &s;eemed wholly exhau&s;ted with fatigue. Speed I was nearly unable to exert for any conti|nuance; and, if I could, with the enemy &s;o clo&s;e at my heels, &s;peed would too probably have been u&s;ele&s;s It appeared as if I were now in almo&s;t the &s;ame &s;ituation, as that in which I had been placed five or &s;ix weeks before, in which after having completed my e&s;cape I was obliged to yield my&s;elf up without re&s;i&s;tance to my pur&s;uers. I was not however di&s;abled as then; I was capable of exertion to what preci&s;e extent I could not a&s;|certain; and I was well aware that every in&s;tance in which I &s;hould fail of my purpo&s;e, would con|tribute to enhance the difficulty of any future at|tempt. Such were the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iderations that pre&s;ent|ed them&s;elves in relation to my e&s;cape; and, even if that were effected, I had to reckon among my difficulties that, at the time I quitted my pri&s;on, I was de&s;titute of every re&s;ource, and had not a &s;hilling remaining in the world.</P>

<P>I PASSED along the lane I had de&s;cribed without perceiving or being ob&s;erved by a human being. The doors were &s;hut, the window-&s;hutters clo&s;ed, and all was &s;till as night. I reached the extremity of the lane unmole&s;ted. My pur&s;uers, if they immediately followed, would know that the like|lihood was &s;mall of my having in the interval found &s;helter in this place; and would proceed without he&s;itation, as I on my part was obliged to do, from the end neare&s;t to the pri&s;on to its farthe&s;t termina|tion.</P>
<P>The face of the country, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to which I had thus opened my&s;elf a pa&s;&s;age, was rude and uncultivated. It was overgrown with bru&s;hwood and furze; the &s;oil was for the mo&s;t part of a loo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and; and the &s;urface extremely irregular. I climbed a &s;mall eminence, and could perceive not very remote in the di&s;tance a few cottages thinly &s;cattered. This pro&s;pect did not altogether plea&s;e me; I conceived that my &s;afety would for the pre|&s;ent be extremely benefited by keeping my&s;elf from the view of any human being.</P>
<P>I therefore came down again into the valley, and upon a careful examination perceived that it was inter&s;per&s;ed with cavities, &s;ome deeper than others, but all of them &s;o &s;hallow as neither to be capable of hiding a man, nor of exciting &s;u&s;picion as places of po&s;&s;ible concealment. Meanwhile the day had but ju&s;t begun to dawn; the morning was lowering and drizzly; and, though the depth of
<PB N="68" REF="028752_0296_0FDBF252106FEE78">
the&s;e caverns was of cour&s;e well known to the neighbouring inhabitants, the &s;hadows they ca&s;t were &s;o black and impenetrable as might well have produced wider expectations in the mind of a &s;tranger. Poor therefore as was the protection they were able to afford, I thought it right to have recour&s;e to it for the moment as the be&s;t the emer|gency would &s;upply. It was for my life; and, the greater was the jeopardy to which it was expo&s;ed, the more dear did that life &s;eem to become to my affections. The rece&s;s I cho&s;e as mo&s;t &s;ecure was within little more than a hundred yards of the end of the lane and the extreme buildings of the town.</P>
<P>I had not &s;tood up in this manner two minutes, before I heard the &s;ound of feet, and pre&s;ently &s;aw the ordinary turnkey and another pa&s;s by the place of my retreat. They were &s;o clo&s;e to me that, if I had &s;tretched out my hand, I believe I could have caught hold of their clothes without &s;o much as changing my po&s;ture. As no part of the over|hanging earth intervened between me and them, I could &s;ee them entire, though the deepne&s;s of the &s;hade rendered me almo&s;t completely invi&s;ible. I heard them &s;ay to each other, in tones of vehe|ment a&s;perity, Cur&s;e the ra&s;cal! which way can he be gone? Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> reply was, Damn him!

From the very &s;hort time that elap&s;ed between my e&s;cape and the appearance of the&s;e men, I concluded that they had made their way through the &s;ame outlet as I had done, it being impo&s;&s;ible that they could have had time to come

<P>I was &s;o alarmed at this in&s;tance of diligence on the part of the enemy, that for &s;ome time I &s;carce|ly ventured to proceed an inch from my place of concealment, or almo&s;t to change my po&s;ture. The morning, which had been bleak and drizzly, was &s;ucceeded by a day of heavy and ince&s;&s;ant rain: and the gloomy &s;tate of the air and &s;urrounding objects, together with the extreme nearne&s;s of my pri&s;on, and a total want of food, cau&s;ed me to pa&s;s the hours in no very agreeable &s;en&s;ations. This inclemency of the weather however, which generated a feeling of &s;tillne&s;s and &s;olitude, en|couraged me by degrees to change my retreat, for another of the &s;ame nature, but of &s;omewhat greater &s;ecurity. I hovered with little variation about a &s;ingle &s;pot as long as the &s;un continued above the horizon.</P>
<P>Towards evening the clouds began to di&s;per&s;e, and the moon &s;hone, as on the preceding night, in full brightne&s;s. I had perceived no human creature during the whole day, except in the in|&s;tance already mentioned. This had perhaps been owing to the nature of the day; at all events I con&s;idered it as too hazardous an experiment to venture from my hiding-place in &s;o clear and fine a night. I was therefore obliged to wait for the &s;etting of this luminary, which was not till near five o'clock in the morning. My only relief during this interval was to allow my&s;elf to &s;ink to the bot|tom of my cavern, it being &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for me to continue any longer on my feet. Here I fell into an interrupted and unrefre&s;hing doze, the con&s;equence of a laborious night and a tedious, melancholy day; though I rather &s;ought to avoid
<PB N="70" REF="028752_0298_0FDBF25392D5A7C0">
&s;leep, which, co-operating with the coldne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, would tend more to injury than ad|vantage.</P>
<P>The period of darkne&s;s which I had determined to u&s;e for the purpo&s;e of removing to a greater di&s;tance from my pri&s;on was in its whole duration &s;omething le&s;s than three hours. When I ro&s;e from my &s;eat, I was weak with hunger and fatigue, and, which was wor&s;e, I &s;eemed between the dampne&s;s of the preceding day, and the &s;harp, clear fro&s;t of the night, to have lo&s;t the command of my limbs. I &s;tood up and &s;hook my&s;elf; I leaned again&s;t the &s;ide of the hill, impelling in dif|ferent directions the mu&s;cles of the extremities; and at length recovered in &s;ome degree the &s;en&s;e of feeling. This operation was attended with an incredible aching pain, and required no common &s;hare of re&s;olution to encounter and pro&s;ecute it. Having quitted my retreat, I at fir&s;t advanced with weak and tottering &s;teps; but, as I proceeded, increa&s;ed my pace. The barren heath which reached to the edge of the town was at lea&s;t on this &s;ide without a path; but the &s;tars &s;hone, and guiding my&s;elf by them I determined to &s;teer as far as po&s;&s;ible from the hateful &s;cene where I had been &s;o long confined. The line I pur&s;ued was of irregular &s;urface, &s;ometimes obliging me to climb a &s;teep a&s;cent, and at others to go down into a dark and impenetrable dell. I was often compelled by the dangerou&s;ne&s;s of the way to deviate con&s;ider|ably from the direction I wi&s;hed to pur&s;ue. In the mean time I advanced with as much rapidity, as the&s;e and &s;imilar ob&s;tacles would permit me to do. The &s;wiftne&s;s of the motion and the thinne&s;s of the air re&s;tored to me my alacrity. I forgot the inconveniences under which I laboured, and my mind became lively, &s;pirited and enthu&s;ia&s;tic.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="028752_0299_0FDBF29D2ED58080">
I had now reached the border of the heath and entered upon what is u&s;ually termed the fore&s;t. Strange as it may &s;eem, it is neverthele&s;s true, that, exhau&s;ted as I was with hunger, de&s;titute of all provi&s;ion for the future, and &s;urrounded with the mo&s;t alarming dangers, my mind &s;uddenly became glowing, animated and chearful. I thought that by this time the mo&s;t formidable difficulties of my undertaking were &s;urmounted; and I could not believe that, after having effected &s;o much, I &s;hould find any thing invincible in what remained to be done. I recollected the confinement I had under|gone and the fate that had impended over me with horror. Never did man feel more vividly than I felt at that moment the &s;weets of liberty. Never did man more &s;trenuou&s;ly prefer poverty with in|dependence to the artificial allurements of a life of &s;lavery. I &s;tretched forth my arms with rapture, I clapped my hands one upon the other, and ex|claimed, Ah, this is indeed to be a man! The&s;e wri&s;ts were lately galled with fetters; all my mo|tions, whether I ro&s;e up or &s;at down, were echoed to with the clanking of chains; I was tied down like a wild bea&s;t, and could not move but in a cir|cle of a few feet in circumference. Now I can run, fleet as a greyhound; and leap like a young roe upon the mountains. Oh, God! (if God there be, that conde&s;cends to record the lonely beatings of an anxious heart) thou only can&s;t tell with what delight a pri&s;oner, ju&s;t broke forth from his dun|geon, hugs the ble&s;&s;ings of new-found liberty! Sa|cred and inde&s;cribable moment, when man regains his rights! But lately I held my life in jeopardy, becau&s;e one man was unprincipled enough to a&s;&s;ert what he knew to be fal&s;e; I was de&s;tined to &s;uffer an early and inexorable death from the hands of others, becau&s;e none of them had penetration
<PB N="72" REF="028752_0300_0FDBF25803473BC0">
enough to di&s;tingui&s;h from fal&s;hood what I uttered with the entire conviction of a full-fraught heart! Strange, that men from age of age &s;hould con&s;ent to hold their lives at the breath of another, merely that each in his turn may have a power of acting the tyrant according to law! Oh, God! give me poverty! &s;hower upon me all the imaginary hard|&s;hips of human life! I will receive them all with thankfulne&s;s. Turn me a prey to the wild bea&s;ts of the de&s;ert, &s;o I be never again the victim of man dre&s;&s;ed in the gore-dripping robes of autho|rity! Suffer me at lea&s;t to call life and the pur|&s;uits of life my own! Let me hold it at the mercy of elements, of the hunger of bea&s;ts or the revenge of barbarians, but not of the cold-blooded pru|dence of monopoli&s;ts and kings!&mdash;How enviable was the enthu&s;ia&s;m which could thus furni&s;h me with energy, in the mid&s;t of hunger, poverty and univer&s;al de&s;ertion!</P>
<P>I had now walked at lea&s;t &s;ix miles. At fir&s;t I carefully avoided the habitations that lay in my way, and feared to be &s;een by any of the per&s;ons to whom they belonged, le&s;t it &s;hould in any de|gree furni&s;h a clue to the re&s;earches of my pur|&s;uers. As I went forward, I conceived it might be proper to relax a part of my precaution. At this time I perceived &s;everal per&s;ons coming out of a thicket clo&s;e to me. I immediately con&s;idered this circum&s;tance as rather favourable than the contrary. It was nece&s;&s;ary for me to avoid enter|ing any of the towns and villages in the vicinity. At the &s;ame time it was full time that I &s;hould pro|cure for my&s;elf &s;ome &s;pecies of refre&s;hment; and it was by no means improbable that the&s;e men might be in &s;ome way a&s;&s;i&s;ting to me in that re|&s;pect. In my &s;ituation it appeared to me indif|ferent what might be their employment or pro|fe&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="73" REF="028752_0301_0FDBF2A21C8E7490">
I had little to apprehend from thieves, and I believed that they, as well as hone&s;t men, could not fail to have &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion for a per&s;on under my circum&s;tances. I therefore rather threw my&s;elf in their way than avoided them.</P>
<P>They were thieves. One of the company cried out, Who goes there? &s;tand! I acco&s;ted them. Gentlemen, &s;aid I, I am a poor traveller, almo&s;t&mdash;While I &s;poke, they came round me, and he that had fir&s;t hailed me &s;aid, Damn me, tip us none of your palaver; we have heard that &s;tory of a poor traveller any time the&s;e five years. Come, down with your du&s;t! let us &s;ee what you have got! Sir, I replied, I have not a &s;hilling in the world, and am more than half-&s;tarved be&s;ide. Not a &s;hil|ling! an&s;wered my a&s;&s;ailant, what, I &s;uppo&s;e you are as poor as a thief? But, if you have not money, you have clothes, and tho&s;e you mu&s;t re&s;ign.</P>
<P>My clothes! rejoined I with indignation; you cannot de&s;ire &s;uch a thing. Is it not enough that I am pennyle&s;s? I have been all night upon the open heath. It is now the &s;econd day that I have not eaten a mor&s;el of bread. Would you &s;trip me naked to the weather in the mid&s;t of this depopu|lated fore&s;t? No, no, you are men! The &s;ame hatred of oppre&s;&s;ion that arms you again&s;t the in|&s;olence of wealth, will teach you to relieve tho&s;e who are peri&s;hing like me. For God's &s;ake, give me food! do not &s;trip me of the benefits I &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s!</P>
<P>While I uttered this apo&s;trophe, the unpreme|ditated eloquence of &s;entiment, I could perceive by their ge&s;tures, though the day had not yet be|gun to dawn, that the feelings of one or two of the company appeared to take my part. The man, who had already undertaken to be their &s;poke&s;man,
<PB N="74" REF="028752_0302_0FDBF258D099F060">
perceived the &s;ame thing; and, excited either by the brutality of his temper or the love of com|mand, ha&s;tened to anticipate the di&s;grace of a de|feat. He bru&s;hed &s;uddenly up to me, and by main force pu&s;hed me &s;everal feet from the place where I &s;tood. The &s;hock I received drove me upon a &s;econd of the gang, not one of tho&s;e who had li&s;tened to my expo&s;tulation; and he repeated the &s;ame brutality. My indignation was &s;trongly ex|cited by this treatment; and, after being thru&s;t backward and forward two or three times in this manner, I broke through my a&s;&s;ailants, and turned round to defend my&s;elf. The fir&s;t that advanced within my reach was my original enemy. In the pre&s;ent moment I li&s;tened to nothing but the dic|tates of pa&s;&s;ion, and I laid him at his length on the earth. I was immediately a&s;&s;ailed with &s;ticks and bludgeons on all &s;ides, and pre&s;ently received a blow that almo&s;t deprived me of my &s;en&s;es. The man I had knocked down was now upon his feet again, and aimed a &s;troke at me with a cutla&s;s as I fell, which took place in a deep wound upon my neck and &s;houlder. He was going to repeat his blow. The two who had &s;eemed to waver at fir&s;t in their animo&s;ity, afterwards appeared to me to join in the attack, urged either by animal &s;ym|pathy or the &s;pirit of imitation. One of them however, as I afterwards under&s;tood, &s;eized the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rm of the man who was going to &s;trike me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;econd time with his cutla&s;s, and who would other|wi&s;e probably have put an end to my exi&s;tence. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could hear the words, Damn it, enough, enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that is too bad, Jones!

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>IN this woful &s;ituation, though extremely weak, I was not deprived of &s;en&s;e. I tore my &s;hirt from my naked body, and with it endeavoured with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s to make a bandage to &s;tanch the flow|ing of the blood. I then exerted my&s;elf to crawl up the &s;ide of the ditch. I had &s;carcely effected the latter, when with equal &s;urpri&s;e and joy I per|ceived a man advancing at no great di&s;tance. I called for help as well as I could. The man came towards me with evident &s;igns of compa&s;&s;ion, and the figure I exhibited was indeed &s;ufficiently calcu|lated to excite it. I had no hat. My hair was di&s;heveled, and the ends of the locks clotted with blood. My &s;hirt was wrapped about my neck and &s;houlder, and was plentifully &s;tained with red. My body which was naked to my middle was variegated with &s;treams of blood, nor had my breeches which were of leather by any means e&s;|caped.</P>
<P>For God's &s;ake, my poor fellow! &s;aid he, with a tone of the greate&s;t imaginable kindne&s;s, how came you thus? And, &s;aying this, he lifted me up, and &s;et me on my feet. Can you &s;tand? added he doubtfully. Oh, yes, very well, I replied. Having received this an&s;wer, he quitted me, and began to take off his own coat, that he might cover me from the cold. I had however overrated my &s;trength, and was no &s;ooner left to my&s;elf, than I reeled, and fell almo&s;t at my length upon the
<PB N="77" REF="028752_0305_0FDBF2A654BD5B50">
ground. But I broke my fall by &s;tretching out my &s;ound arm, and again rai&s;ed my&s;elf upon my knees. My benefactor now covered me, rai&s;ed me, and bidding me lean upon him, told me he would pre|&s;ently conduct me to a place where I &s;hould be taken care of. Courage is a capricious property; and, though while I had no one to depend upon but my&s;elf, I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mine of &s;eemingly inex|hau&s;tible fortitude, yet no &s;ooner did I find this unexpected &s;ympathy on the part of another, than my re&s;olution appeared to give way, and I felt my|&s;elf ready to &s;aint. My charitable conductor per|ceived this, and he every now and then encouraged me in a manner &s;o chearful, &s;o good humoured and benevolent, equally free from the har&s;hne&s;s of rebuke and the weakne&s;s of indulgence, that I thought my&s;elf under the conduct of an angel ra|ther than a man. I could perceive that his beha|viour had in it nothing of boori&s;h rudene&s;s, and that he was thoroughly imbued with the principles of affectionate civility.</P>
<P>We walked about three quarters of a mile, and that not towards the open, but the mo&s;t uncouth and unfrequented part of the fore&s;t. We cro&s;&s;ed a place which had once been a moat, but which was now in &s;ome parts dry and in others contained a little muddy and &s;tagnated water. Within the inclo&s;ure of this moat, and among the &s;till vi&s;ible foundations of a larger, ancient building, was a cottage, or rather two or three cottages irregularly thrown together, not different from the habitations of the pea&s;antry in general, except that they were con&s;tructed for the mo&s;t part of materials &s;upplied from this ancient ruin.</P>
<P>My conductor knocked at the door, and was an|&s;wered by a voice from within, which for body and force might have been the voice of a man, but
<PB N="78" REF="028752_0306_0FDBF25F925E1660">
which had a &s;ort of female &s;harpne&s;s and acidity, with the enquiry, Who is there? Satisfaction was no &s;ooner given in this point, than I heard two bolts pu&s;hed back and the door unlocked. The apartment opened, and we entered. The interior of the building by no means corre&s;ponded with the appearance of my protector, but on the contrary wore a face of di&s;comfort, carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. The only per&s;on I &s;aw within was a woman, ra|ther advanced in life, and who&s;e appearance had I know not what of extraordinary and loath&s;ome. Her eyes were red and blood-&s;hot; her hair was pendent in matted and &s;haggy tre&s;&s;es about her &s;houlders; her complexion &s;warthy, and of the con&s;i&s;tency of parchment; her form &s;pare, and her whole body, her arms in particular, uncommonly vigorous and mu&s;cular. Not the milk of human kindne&s;s, but the feverous blood of &s;avage ferocity &s;eemed to flow from her heart; and her whole figure &s;ugge&s;ted an idea of unmitigable energy and an appetite gorged in malevolence. This infernal Thale&s;tris had no &s;ooner ca&s;t her eyes upon us as we entered, than &s;he exclaimed in a di&s;cordant and di&s;contented voice, What have we got here? this is not one of our people! My conductor, without an&s;wering this apo&s;trophe, bid her pu&s;h an ea&s;y chair which &s;tood in one corner, and &s;et it directly before the fire. This &s;he did with ap|parent reluctance, muttering, Ah, you are at your old tricks; I wonder what &s;uch folks as we have to do with charity! It will be the ruin of us at la&s;t, I can &s;ee that! Hold your tongue, beldam! &s;aid he, with a &s;tern &s;ignificance of manner, and fetch one of my be&s;t &s;hirts, a wai&s;tcoat and &s;ome dre&s;&s;ings. Saying this, he at the &s;ame time put into her hand a &s;mall bunch of keys. In a word, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e treated me with as much kindne&s;s as if he had
<PB N="79" REF="028752_0307_0FDBF2AC2E6FD528">
been my father. He examined my wound, wa&s;h|ed and dre&s;&s;ed it; at the &s;ame time that the old woman by his expre&s;s order prepared for me &s;uch nouri&s;hment as he thought mo&s;t &s;uitable to my weak and languid condition.</P>
<P>The&s;e operations were no &s;ooner completed, than my benefactor recommended to me to retire to re&s;t, and preparations were making for that pur|po&s;e, when &s;uddenly a trampling of feet was heard, &s;ucceeded by a knock at the door. The old woman opened the door with the &s;ame precautions as had been employed upon our arrival, and immediately &s;ix or &s;even per&s;ons tumultuou&s;ly entered the apart|ment. Their appearance was different, &s;ome hav|ing the air of mere ru&s;tics, and others that of a tarni&s;hed &s;ort of gentry. All had a feature of boldne&s;s, inquietude and di&s;order, extremely un|like any thing I had before ob&s;erved in &s;uch a groupe. But my a&s;toni&s;hment was &s;till increa&s;ed, when upon a &s;econd glance I perceived &s;omething in the general air of &s;everal of them, and of one in particular, that per&s;uaded me they were the gang from which I had ju&s;t e&s;caped, and this one the antagoni&s;t by who&s;e animo&s;ity I was &s;o near to the having been finally de&s;troyed. I in&s;tantly ima|gined they had entered our hovel with a ho&s;tile intention, that my benefactor was upon the point of being robbed, and I probably murdered.</P>
<P>This &s;u&s;picion however was &s;oon removed. They addre&s;&s;ed my conductor with re&s;pect under the appellation of captain. They were boi&s;terous and noi&s;y in their remarks and exclamations, but their turbulence was tempered by a certain defe|rence to his opinion and authority. I could ob|&s;erve in the per&s;on who had been my active oppo|nent &s;ome aukwardne&s;s and irre&s;olution as he fir&s;t perceived me, which he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a &s;ort of
<PB N="80" REF="028752_0308_0FDBF2610F929E38">
effort, exclaiming, Who the devil is here? There was &s;omething in the tone of this apo&s;trophe that rou&s;ed the attention of my protector. He looked at the &s;peaker with a fixed and penetrating glance, and then &s;aid, Nay, Jones, do you know? Did you ever &s;ee the per&s;on before? Cur&s;e it, Jones! interrupted a third, you are damnably out of luck. They &s;ay dead men walk, and you &s;ee there is &s;ome truth in it. Truce with your impertinence, Bar|ton! replied my protector, this is no proper occa|&s;ion for a joke. An&s;wer me, Jones, were you the cau&s;e of this young man being left naked and wounded this bitter morning upon the fore&s;t?</P>
<P>Mayhap I was. What then?</P>
<P>What provocation could induce you to &s;o cruel a treatment?</P>
<P>Provocation enough. He had no money.</P>
<P>What, did you u&s;e him thus without &s;o much as being irritated by any re&s;i&s;tance on his part?</P>
<P>Yes, he did re&s;i&s;t. I only hu&s;tled him, and he had the impudence to &s;trike me.</P>
<P>Jones! you are an incorrigible fellow.</P>
<P>Pooh, what &s;ignifies what I am? You with your compa&s;&s;ion and your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine feelings will bring us all to the gallows.</P>
<P>I have nothing to &s;ay to you; I have no hopes of you! Comrades, it is for you to decide upon the conduct of this man as you think proper. You know how repeated his offences have been; you know what pains I have taken to mend him. Our profe&s;&s;ion is the profe&s;&s;ion of ju&s;tice. [It is thus that the prejudices of men univer&s;ally teach them to colour the mo&s;t de&s;perate cau&s;e, to which they have determined to adhere.] We undertake to counteract the partiality and iniquity of public in|&s;titutions. We, who are thieves without a licence, are at open war with another &s;et of men, who are
<PB N="81" REF="028752_0309_0FDBF2AD90927E20">
thieves according to law. If any one di&s;approve our proceedings, at lea&s;t we have this to &s;ay for our&s;elves, we act not by choice, but only as our wi&s;e governors force us to act. If any one di&s;ap|prove our proceedings, they have this apology in their favour, we ri&s;k our lives when we adopt them, and &s;take our all upon their goodne&s;s and cogency. Time will one day decide whether we or our op|pre&s;&s;ors be the genuine patriots: for the pre&s;ent we are cen&s;ured, only becau&s;e they are the &s;tronger party. With &s;uch a cau&s;e then to bear us out, &s;hall we &s;tain it with cruelty, malice and revenge? For my own part I glory in the name of a thief; and am firmly per&s;uaded there is not a more gal|lant and honourable profe&s;&s;ion upon the face of the earth, &s;o long as it is exerci&s;ed with a generous heart.&mdash;A thief is of cour&s;e a man living among his equals; I do not pretend therefore to a&s;&s;ume any authority among you; act as you think pro|per; but &s;o far as relates to my&s;elf&punc; I vote that Jones be expelled from among us as a di&s;grace to our &s;ociety.</P>
<P>This propo&s;ition &s;eemed to meet the general &s;en&s;e. It was ea&s;y to perceive that the opinion of the re&s;t coincided with that of their leader; not|with&s;tanding which a few of them he&s;itated as to the conduct to be pur&s;ued. In the mean time Jones muttered &s;omething in a &s;urly and irre&s;olute way about taking care how they provoked him. This in&s;inuation in&s;tantly rou&s;ed the courage of my protector, and his eyes fla&s;hed with contempt.</P>
<P>Ra&s;cal! &s;aid he, do you menace us? Do you think we will be your &s;laves? No, no, do your wor&s;t! Go to the next ju&s;tice of the peace and impeach us&punc; I can ea&s;ily believe you are capable of it. Sir, when we entered into this gang, we were not &s;uch fools as not to know
<PB N="82" REF="028752_0310_0FDBF2660922A750">
that we entered upon a &s;ervice of danger. One of its dangers con&s;i&s;ts in the treachery of fellows like you. But we did not enter at fir&s;t, to flinch now.

That would be a ble&s;&s;ed life in|deed! I would rather &s;ee my fle&s;h torn piecemeal from my bones! Go, &s;ir! I defy you! You dare not do it! You dare not &s;acrifice all the&s;e gallant fellows to your rage, and publi&s;h your&s;elf to all the world a traitor and a &s;coundrel! If you do, you will puni&s;h your&s;elf, not us! Begone!</P>
<P>The intrepidity of the leader communicated it|&s;elf to the re&s;t of the company. Jones ea&s;ily &s;aw that there was no hope of bringing them over to a contrary &s;entiment. After a &s;hort pau&s;e, he an|&s;wered, I did not mean&mdash;No, damn it! I will not &s;nivel neither. I was always true to my princi|ples, and a friend to you all. But, &s;ince you are re&s;olved to turn me out, why&mdash;good bye to you!</P>
<P>The expul&s;ion of this man produced a remark|able improvement in the whole gang. Tho&s;e who were before inclined to humanity, a&s;&s;umed new energy in proportion as they &s;aw &s;uch &s;entiments likely to prevail. They had before &s;uffered them|&s;elves to be overborne by the boi&s;terous in&s;olence of their antagoni&s;ts; but now they adopted and with &s;ucce&s;s a different conduct. Tho&s;e who en|vied the a&s;cendancy of their comrade, and there|fore imitated his conduct, began to he&s;itate in their career. Stories were brought forward of the cru|elty and brutality of Jones, both to men and animals, which had never before reached the ear of the leader. The&s;e &s;tories I &s;hall not repeat. They could ex|cite only emotions of abhorrence and di&s;gu&s;t, and
<PB N="83" REF="028752_0311_0FDBF2B355675EC0">
&s;ome of them argued a mind of &s;uch a &s;tretch of depravity as to many readers would appear utterly incredible. And yet this man had his virtues. He was enterpri&s;ing, per&s;evering and faithful.</P>
<P>His removal was a con&s;iderable benefit to me. It would have been no &s;mall hard&s;hip to have been turned adrift immediately under my unfavourable circum&s;tances, with the additional di&s;advantage of the wound I had received; and yet I could &s;carcely have ventured to remain under the &s;ame roof with a man to whom my appearance was as a guilty con|&s;cience, perpetually reminding him of his own offence and the counteraction of his leader. His profe&s;&s;ion accu&s;tomed him to a certain degree of indifference to con&s;equences, and indulgence to the &s;allies of pa&s;&s;ion; and he might ea&s;ily have found his opportunity to in&s;ult or injure me, when I &s;hould have had nothing but my own debilitated exertions to protect me.</P>
<P>Freed from this danger, I found my &s;ituation &s;ufficiently fortunate for a man under my circum|&s;tances. It was attended with all the advantages for concealment my fonde&s;t imagination could have hoped; and it was by no means de&s;titute of the benefits which ari&s;e from kindne&s;s and humanity. Nothing could be more unlike than the thieves I had &s;een in&mdash;gaol, and the thieves of my new re&s;idence. The latter were generally full of chear|fulne&s;s and merriment. They could expatiate freely wherever they thought proper. They could form plans and execute them. They con&s;ulted their own inclinations. They did not impo&s;e upon them&s;elves the ta&s;k, as is too often the ca&s;e in hu|man &s;ociety, of &s;eeming tacitly to approve that from which they &s;uffered mo&s;t; or, which is wor&s;e, of per&s;uading them&s;elves that all the wrongs they &s;uffered were right; but were at open war
<PB N="84" REF="028752_0312_0FDBF267196BB0C0">
with their oppre&s;&s;ors. On the contrary the im|pri&s;oned felons I had lately &s;een were &s;hut up like wild bea&s;ts in a cage, deprived of activity, and pal&s;ied with indolence. The occa&s;ional demon&s;tra|tions that &s;till remained of their former enter|pri&s;ing life, were the &s;tarts and convul&s;ions of di&s;|ea&s;e, not the meditated and con&s;i&s;tent exertions of a mind in health. They had no more of hope, of project, of golden and animated dreams, but were re&s;erved to the mo&s;t di&s;mal pro&s;pects, and for|bidden to think upon any other topic. It is true that the&s;e two &s;cenes were parts of one whole, the one the con&s;ummation, the hourly to be expected &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the other. But the men I now &s;aw were wholly inattentive to this, and in that re&s;pect appeared to have no intercour&s;e with reflection or rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I might in one view, as I have &s;aid, congratulate my&s;elf upon my pre&s;ent re&s;idence; it an&s;wered completely the purpo&s;es of concealment. It was the &s;eat of merriment and hilarity; but the hila|rity that characteri&s;ed it, produced no corre&s;pon|dent feelings in my bo&s;om. The per&s;ons who compo&s;ed this &s;ociety, had each of them ca&s;t off all controul from e&s;tabli&s;hed principle; their trade was terror, and their con&s;tant object to elude the vigilance of the community. The influence of the&s;e circum&s;tances was vi&s;ible in their character. I found among them benevolence and kindne&s;s; they were &s;trongly &s;u&s;ceptible of emotions of ge|nero&s;ity. But, as their &s;ituation was precarious, their di&s;po&s;itions were proportionably fluctuating. Inured to the animo&s;ity of their &s;pecies, they were irritable and pa&s;&s;ionate. Accu&s;tomed to exerci&s;e har&s;hne&s;s towards the &s;ubject of their depredations, they did not always confine their brutality within that &s;cope. They were habituated to con&s;ider
<PB N="85" REF="028752_0313_0FDBF2B450BFD398">
wounds, and bludgeons and &s;tabbing, as the obvi|ous mode of &s;urmounting every difficulty. Unin|volved in the debilitating routine of human affairs, they frequently di&s;played an energy, which from every impartial ob&s;erver would have extorted vene|ration. Energy is perhaps of all qualities the mo&s;t invaluable; and a ju&s;t political &s;y&s;tem would po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of extracting from it thus circum&s;tanced its beneficial qualities, in&s;tead of con&s;igning it as now to unlimited de&s;truction. We act like the chymi&s;t who &s;hould reject the fine&s;t ore, and em|ploy none but what was &s;ufficiently deba&s;ed to fit it immediately for the vile&s;t u&s;es. But the energy of the&s;e men, &s;uch as I beheld it, was in the highe&s;t degree mi&s;applied, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by any liberal and enlightened views, and directed only to the mo&s;t narrow and contemptible purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The re&s;idence I have been de&s;cribing might to many per&s;ons have appeared attended with into|lerable inconveniences. But, exclu&s;ively of its advantages as a field for &s;peculation, it was Ely&s;ium compared with that from which I had ju&s;t e&s;caped. Di&s;plea&s;ing company, incommodious apartments, filthine&s;s and riot, lo&s;t the circum&s;tance by which they could mo&s;t effectually di&s;gu&s;t, when I was not compelled to remain with them. All hard&s;hips I could patiently endure, in compari&s;on with the menace of a violent and untimely death. There was no &s;uffering that I could not per&s;uade my&s;elf to con&s;ider as trivial, except that which flowed from the tyranny, the frigid precaution, or the inhuman revenge of my own &s;pecies.</P>
<P>My recovery advanced in the mo&s;t favourable manner. The attention and kindne&s;s of my pro|tector were ince&s;&s;ant, and the re&s;t caught the &s;pirit from his example. The old woman who &s;uperin|tended the hou&s;hold, &s;till retained her animo&s;ity.
<PB N="86" REF="028752_0314_0FDBF26D1673C998">
She con&s;idered me as the cau&s;e of the expul&s;ion of Jones from the fraternity; Jones had been the object of her particular partiality; and, zealous as &s;he was for the public concern, &s;he thought an old and experienced &s;inner for a raw probationer but an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill exchange. Add to which, that her habits inclined her to moro&s;ene&s;s and di&s;content, and that per&s;ons of her complexion &s;eem unable to exi&s;t without &s;ome object upon which to employ the &s;u|perfluity of their gall. She lo&s;t no opportunity upon the mo&s;t trifling occa&s;ion of di&s;playing her animo&s;ity, and ever and anon eyed me with a fu|rious glance of canine hunger for my de&s;truction. Nothing was more evidently mortifying to her than the procra&s;tination of her malice; nor could &s;he bear to think that a fiercene&s;s &s;o gigantic and un|controulable &s;hould &s;how it&s;elf in nothing more terrific than the pigmy &s;pite of a chamber-maid. For my&s;elf, I had been accu&s;tomed to the warfare of formidable adver&s;aries and the encounter of alarming dangers; and what I &s;aw of her &s;pleen had not power &s;ufficient to di&s;turb my tranquillity.</P>
<P>As I recovered, I told my &s;tory, except &s;o far as related to the detection of Mr. Falkland's eventful &s;ecret, to my protector. That particular I could not as yet prevail upon my&s;elf to di&s;clo&s;e even in a &s;ituation like this, which &s;eemed to preclude the po&s;&s;ibility of its being made u&s;e of to the di&s;ad|vantage of my per&s;ecutor. My pre&s;ent auditor however, who&s;e habits of thinking were extremely oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of Mr. Fore&s;ter, did not from the ob&s;curity which flowed from this re&s;erve, deduce any unfavourable conclu&s;ion. His penetration was &s;uch as to afford little room for an impo&s;tor to hope to mi&s;lead him by a fictitious &s;tatement, and he confided in that penetration. So confiding, the &s;implicity and integrity of my manner carried con|viction
<PB N="87" REF="028752_0315_0FDBF2BA1150DC80">
to his mind, and in&s;ured his good opinion and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>He li&s;tened to my &s;tory with eagerne&s;s, and com|mented on the &s;everal parts as I related them. He &s;aid that this was only one fre&s;h in&s;tance of the tyranny and perfidiou&s;ne&s;s exerci&s;ed by the power|ful members of the community again&s;t tho&s;e who were le&s;s privileged than them&s;elves. Nothing could be more clear than their readine&s;s to &s;acrifice the human &s;pecies at large to their meane&s;t intere&s;t or wilde&s;t caprice. Who that &s;aw the &s;ituation in its true light would wait till their oppre&s;&s;ors thought &s;it to decree their de&s;truction, and not take arms in their defence while it was yet in their power? Which was mo&s;t meritorious, the unre|&s;i&s;ting and da&s;tardly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of a &s;lave, or the enterpri&s;e and gallantry of the man who dared to a&s;&s;ert his claims? Since by the partial admini&s;tra|tion of our laws innocence, when power was armed again&s;t it, had nothing better to hope for than guilt, what man of true courage would fail to &s;et the&s;e laws at defiance, and, if he mu&s;t &s;uffer by their inju&s;tice, at lea&s;t take care that he had fir&s;t &s;hown his contempt of their yoke? For him|&s;elf he &s;hould certainly never have embraced his pre&s;ent calling, had he not been &s;timulated to it by the&s;e cogent and irre&s;i&s;tible rea&s;ons; and he hoped, as experience had &s;o forcibly brought a conviction of this &s;ort to my mind, that he &s;hould for the fu|ture have the happine&s;s to a&s;&s;ociate me to his pur|&s;uits.&mdash;It will pre&s;ently be &s;een how far the&s;e hopes were confirmed by the event.</P>
<P>Numerous were the precautions exerci&s;ed by the gang of thieves with whom I now re&s;ided to elude the vigilance of the &s;atellites of ju&s;tice. It was one of their rules to commit no depredations but at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the place of their
<PB N="88" REF="028752_0316_0FDBF26E8FBF6328">
re&s;idence, and Jones had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed this regula|tion, in the attack to which I was indebted for my pre&s;ent a&s;ylum. After having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of any booty, they took care in the &s;ight of the per&s;ons whom they had robbed to pur&s;ue a route as nearly as po&s;&s;ible oppo&s;ite to that which led to their true haunts. The appearance of their place of re&s;idence, together with its environs was pecu|liarly de&s;olate and forlorn, and it had the reputa|tion of being haunted. The old woman I have de&s;cribed had long been its inhabitant, and was commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be its only inhabitant; and her per&s;on well accorded with the rural ideas of a witch. Her lodgers never went out or came in but with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection, and generally by night. The lights which were occa&s;ionally &s;een from various parts of her habitation were by the country people regarded with horror as &s;uperna|tural; and, if the noi&s;e of revelry at any time &s;a|luted their ears, it was imagined to proceed from a carnival of devils. With all the&s;e advantages the thieves did not venture to re&s;ide here but by intervals: &s;ometimes they ab&s;ented them&s;elves for months, and re&s;ided in a different part of the coun|try. The old woman &s;ometimes attended them in the&s;e tran&s;portations, and &s;ometimes remained; but in all ca&s;es her removal took place either &s;ooner or later than theirs, &s;o that the nice&s;t ob&s;erver could &s;carcely have traced any connection between her re-appearances and the alarms of depredation that were frequently given; and the fe&s;tival of demons &s;eemed to the terrified ru&s;tics indifferently to take place whether &s;he were pre&s;ent or ab&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>ONE day, while I continued in this &s;ituation, a circum&s;tance occurred, which involuntarily at|tracted my attention. Two of our people had been &s;ent to a town at &s;ome di&s;tance for the purpo&s;e of procuring us &s;ome things of which we were in want. After having delivered the&s;e to our land|lady, they retired to one corner of the room, and, one of them pulling a printed paper from his pocket, they mutually occupied them&s;elves in ex|amining its contents. I was &s;itting in an ea&s;y chair by the fire, being con&s;iderably better than I had been, though &s;till in a weak and languid &s;tate. Having read for a con&s;iderable time, they looked at me, and then at the paper, and then at me again. They then went out of the room together, as if to con&s;ult without interruption upon &s;ome|thing which that paper &s;ugge&s;ted to them. Some time after they returned, and my protector, who happened to be above &s;tairs, entered the room at the &s;ame in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Captain! &s;aid one of them with an air of plea|&s;ure, look here! we have found a prize! I believe it is as good as a bank note of a hundred guineas.</P>
<P>Mr. Raymond (that was his name) took the paper and read. He pau&s;ed for a moment. He then cru&s;hed the paper in his hand; and, turning to the per&s;on from whom he had received it, &s;aid with the tone of a man confident in the &s;ucce&s;s of his rea&s;ons,</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="028752_0318_0FDBF273020A2FB0">
What u&s;e have you for the&s;e hundred guineas? Are you in want? Are you in di&s;tre&s;s? Can you be contented to purcha&s;e them at the price of trea|chery? of violating the laws of ho&s;pitality?</P>
<P>Faith, captain, I do not very well know. Af|ter having violated other laws, I do not &s;ee why we &s;hould be frightened at an old &s;aw. We pre|tend to judge for our&s;elves, and ought to be above &s;hrinking from a bugbear of a proverb. Be&s;ide, this is a good deed, and I &s;hould think no more harm of being the ruin of &s;uch a thief, than of getting my dinner.</P>
<P>A thief! You talk of thieves!&mdash;</P>
<P>Not &s;o fa&s;t, if you plea&s;e. God defend that I &s;hould &s;ay a word again&s;t thieving as a general occu|pation! But one man &s;teals in one way, and another in another. For my part, I go upon the highway, and take from any &s;tranger I meet what it is a hun|dred to one he can very well &s;pare. I &s;ee nothing to be found fault with in that. But I have as much con&s;cience as another man. Becau&s;e I laugh at a&s;&s;izes and great wigs and the gallows, and becau&s;e I will not be frightened from an innocent action when the lawyers &s;ay me nay, does it follow that I am to have a fellow-feeling for pilferers, and ra&s;|cally &s;ervants, and people that have neither ju&s;tice nor principle? No: I have too much re&s;pect for the trade, not to be a foe to interlopers and people that &s;o much the more de&s;erve my hatred becau&s;e the world calls them by my name.</P>
<P>You are wrong, Wil&s;on! You certainly ought not to employ again&s;t people that you hate, &s;up|po&s;ing your hatred to be rea&s;onable, the in&s;tru|mentality of that law which in your practice you defy. Be con&s;i&s;tent. Either be the friend of law, or its adver&s;ary. Depend upon it that, wherever there are laws at all, there will be laws again&s;t
<PB N="91" REF="028752_0319_0FDBF2C0ABABC388">
&s;uch people as you and I. Either therefore we all of us de&s;erve the vengeance of the law, or law is not the proper in&s;trument of correcting the mi&s;deeds of mankind. I tell you this, becau&s;e I would fain have you aware that an informer or a king's evidence, a man who takes advantage of the confidence of another in order to betray him, who &s;ells the life of his neighbour for money, or coward like, upon any pretence calls in the law to do that for him which he cannot or dares not do for him&s;elf, is the vile&s;t of ra&s;cals. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, if your rea&s;ons were the be&s;t in the world, they do not apply.</P>
<P>While Mr. Raymond was &s;peaking, the re&s;t of the gang came into the room. He immediately turned to them and &s;aid,</P>
<P>My friends, here is a piece of intelligence that Wil&s;on has ju&s;t brought in, which with his leave I will lay before you.</P>
<P>Then, pulling the paper from his pocket, he continued: This is the de&s;cription of a felon with the offer of a hundred guineas for his apprehen|&s;ion. Wil&s;on picked it up at&mdash;. By the time and other circum&s;tances, but particularly by the minute de&s;cription of his per&s;on, there can be no doubt out the object of it is our young friend, who&s;e life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was a little while ago the in&s;trument of &s;aving. He is charged here with having taken advantage of the confidence of his patron and be|nefactor, to rob him of property to a large amount. Upon this charge he was committed to the coun|ty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ail, from whence he made his e&s;cape about a fortnight ago without venturing to &s;tand his trial, a circum&s;tance which is &s;tated by the adverti&s;er <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tantamount to a confe&s;&s;ion of his guilt.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> friends, I was acquainted with the particu|lars of this &s;tory &s;ome time before. This lad let
<PB N="92" REF="028752_0320_0FDBF273D61A62E0">
me into his hi&s;tory at a time that he could not po&s;&s;ibly have fore&s;een that he &s;hould &s;tand in need of that precaution as an antidote again&s;t danger. He is not guilty of what is laid to his charge. Which of you is &s;o ignorant as to &s;uppo&s;e that his e&s;cape is any confirmation of his guilt? Who ever thinks, when he is apprehended for trial, of his innocence or guilt as being at all material to the i&s;&s;ue? Who ever was fool enough to volunteer a trial, where tho&s;e who are to decide think more of the horror of the thing of which he is accu&s;ed than whether he was the per&s;on that did it; and where the nature of our motives is to be collected from a &s;et of ignorant witne&s;&s;es that no wi&s;e man would tru&s;t for a fair repre&s;entation of the mo&s;t indifferent action of his life?</P>
<P>The poor lad's &s;tory is a long one, and I will not trouble you with it now. But from that &s;tory it is as clear as the day, that, becau&s;e he wi&s;hed to leave the &s;ervice of his ma&s;ter, becau&s;e he had been perhaps a little too inqui&s;itive in his ma&s;ter's concerns, and becau&s;e, as I &s;u&s;pect, he had been tru&s;ted with &s;ome important &s;ecrets, his ma&s;ter conceived an antipathy again&s;t him. This antipa|thy gradually proceeded to &s;uch a length, as to in|duce the ma&s;ter to forge this vile accu&s;ation. He &s;eems willing to hang the lad out of the way, ra|ther than &s;uffer him to go where he plea&s;es or get beyond the reach of his power. Williams has told me the &s;tory with &s;uch ingenuou&s;ne&s;s that I am as &s;ure that he is guiltle&s;s of what they lay to his charge as that I am &s;o my&s;elf. Neverthe|le&s;s the man's &s;ervants who were called in to hear the accu&s;ation, and his relation, who as ju&s;tice of the peace made out the mittimus, and who had the folly to think he could be impartial, gave it on his &s;ide with one voice, and thus afforded
<PB N="93" REF="028752_0321_0FDBF29205CA0288">
Williams a &s;ample of what he had to expect in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>Wil&s;on, who when he received this paper had no previous knowledge of particulars, was for tak|ing advantage of it for the purpo&s;e of earning the hundred guineas. Are you of that mind, now you have heard them? Will you for &s;o paltry a con&s;i|deration deliver up the lamb into the jaws of the wolf? Will you abet the purpo&s;es of this &s;angui|nary ra&s;cal who, not contented with driving his late dependent from hou&s;e and home, depriving him of character and all the ordinary means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and leaving him almo&s;t without a re|fuge, &s;till thir&s;ts for his blood? If no other per|&s;on have the courage to &s;et limits to the tyranny of courts of ju&s;tice, &s;hall not we? Shall we, who earn our livelihood by generous daring, be indebted for a penny to the vile artifices of the informer? Shall we, again&s;t whom the whole &s;pecies is in arms, refu&s;e our protection to an individual, more ex|po&s;ed to, but &s;till le&s;s de&s;erving of their per&s;ecuti|on than our&s;elves?</P>
<P>The repre&s;entation of the captain produced an in&s;tant effect upon the whole company. They all exclaimed, Betray him! No, not for worlds! He is &s;afe. We will protect him at the hazard of our lives. If fidelity and honour be bani&s;hed from thieves, where &s;hall they find refuge upon the face of the earth? Wil&s;on in particular thank|ed the captain for his interference, and &s;wore that he would rather part with his right hand, than in|jure &s;o worthy a lad, or a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;uch an unheard of villainy. Saying this, he took me by the hand, and bade me fear nothing. Under their roof, no harm &s;hould ever befal me; and, even if the un|der&s;trappers of the law &s;hould di&s;cover my retreat, they would to a man die in my defence, &s;ooner
<PB N="94" REF="028752_0322_0FDBF275912C7430">
than a hair of my head &s;hould be hurt. I thanked him mo&s;t &s;incerely for his good will; but I was principally &s;truck with the fervent benevolence of my benefactor. I told them, I found that my ene|mies were inexorable, and would never be appea&s;|ed but with my blood; and I a&s;&s;ured them with the mo&s;t &s;olemn and earne&s;t veracity, that I had done nothing to de&s;erve the per&s;ecution which was exerci&s;ed again&s;t me.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit and energy of Mr. Raymond had been &s;uch, as to leave no part for me to perform in repelling this unlooked-for danger. Neverthe|le&s;s, it left a very &s;erious impre&s;&s;ion upon my mind. I had always placed &s;ome confidence in the returning equity of Mr. Falkland. Though he per&s;ecuted me with bitterne&s;s, I could not help believing that he did it unwillingly, and I was per|&s;uaded it would not be for ever. A man, who&s;e original principles had been &s;o full of rectitude and honour, could not fail at &s;ome time or other to re|collect the inju&s;tice of his conduct, and to remit his a&s;perity. This idea had been always pre&s;ent to me, and had in no &s;mall degree con&s;pired to in&s;ti|gate my exertions. I &s;aid, I will convince my per|&s;ecutor that I am of more value than that I &s;hould be &s;acrificed purely by way of precaution. The&s;e expectations on my part had been encouraged by Mr. Falkland's behaviour upon the que&s;tion of my impri&s;onment and by various particulars which had occurred &s;ince.</P>
<P>But this new incident gave to the &s;ubject a to|tally different appearance. I &s;aw him now, not contented with bla&s;ting my reputation, confining me for a period in jail, and reducing me to the &s;i|tuation of a hou&s;ele&s;s vagabond, but &s;till continuing his pur&s;uit under the&s;e forlorn circum&s;tances with unmitigable cruelty. Indignation and re&s;entment

&s;eemed now for the fir&s;t time to penetrate my mind. I knew his mi&s;ery &s;o well, I was &s;o fully acquaint|ed with its cau&s;e, and &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the idea of its being unmerited, that, while I &s;uf|fered &s;o deeply, I &s;till continued to pity, rather than hate my per&s;ecutor. But this incident intro|duced &s;ome change into my feelings. I &s;aid, Surely he might now believe that he had &s;ufficiently di&s;arm|ed me, and might at length &s;uffer me to be at peace. At lea&s;t ought he not to be contented to leave me to my fate, the perilous and uncertain condition of an e&s;caped felon, in&s;tead of thus whetting the animo&s;ity and vigilance of my countrymen again&s;t me? Were his interference on my behalf in oppo|&s;ition to the &s;tern &s;everity of Mr. Fore&s;ter, and his various acts of kindne&s;s &s;ince, a mere part that he played in order to lull me into patience? Was he perpetually haunted with the fear of an ample re|taliation, and for that purpo&s;e did he per&s;onate re|mor&s;e at the very moment that he was &s;ecretly keeping every engine at play that could &s;ecure my de&s;truction? The very &s;u&s;picion of &s;uch a fact filled me with inexpre&s;&s;ible horror, and &s;truck a &s;udden chill through every fibre of my frame.</P>
<P>Meanwhile my wound was by this time com|pletely healed, and it became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould form &s;ome determination re&s;pecting the future. My habits of thinking were &s;uch as gave me an uncontroulable repugnance to the vocation of my ho&s;ts. I did not indeed feel all that aver&s;ion and abhorrence to the men that is commonly entertained. I &s;aw and re&s;pected their good qualities and their virtues. I was by no means inclined to believe them wor&s;e men, or more inimical in their di&s;po&s;itions to the welfare of their &s;pecies, than the generality of tho&s;e that look down upon them with mo&s;t cen&s;ure. But, though I did
<PB N="96" REF="028752_0324_0FDBF279DC877398">
not cea&s;e to love them as individuals, my eyes were perfectly opened to their mi&s;takes. If I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have been in danger of being mi&s;|led, it was my fortune to have &s;tudied felons in a jail, before I &s;tudied them in their &s;tate of com|parative pro&s;perity; and this was an infallible an|tidote to the poi&s;on. I &s;aw that in this profe&s;&s;ion were exerted uncommon energy, ingenuity and fortitude, and I could not help recollecting how admirably beneficial &s;uch qualities might be made in the great theatre of human affairs; while in their pre&s;ent direction they were thrown away upon purpo&s;es that could &s;carcely in any &s;en&s;e de|&s;erve the appellation of u&s;eful. Thieves appeared to me to commit a mi&s;taken trea&s;on again&s;t the general welfare; at the &s;ame time that they were of all men the mo&s;t fooli&s;h as to their own intere&s;ts. The man who ri&s;ks or &s;acrifices his life for the public welfare is rewarded with the te&s;timony of an approving con&s;cience; but per&s;ons who wan|tonly defy the in&s;titutions of their country for no public good, and who&s;e private intere&s;t the lea&s;t degree of &s;ound judgment might prove to be a thou&s;and times better promoted in every po&s;&s;ible in&s;tance by a more legitimate proceeding, are in the &s;ame re&s;pect ab&s;urd and &s;elf-neglectful, as a man would be who &s;hould &s;et him&s;elf up as a mark for a file of mu&s;queteers to &s;hoot at.</P>
<P>Viewing the &s;ubject in this light, I not only de|termined that I would have no &s;hare in their occu|pation my&s;elf, but thought I could not do le&s;s in return for the benefits I had received from them, than endeavour to di&s;&s;uade them from an employ|ment in which they mu&s;t them&s;elves be the greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ufferers. My expo&s;tulation met with a various reception. All the per&s;ons to whom it was ad|dre&s;&s;ed had been tolerably &s;ucce&s;sful in per&s;uading
<PB N="97" REF="028752_0325_0FDBF2C9567D04E0">
them&s;elves of the innocence of their calling; and what remained of doubt in their mind was &s;mo|thered, and, &s;o to &s;peak, laboriou&s;ly forgotten. Some of them laughed at my arguments as a ridi|culous piece of mi&s;&s;ionary quixoti&s;m. Others, and particularly our captain, repelled them with the boldne&s;s of a man that knows he has got the &s;trong|e&s;t &s;ide. But this &s;entiment of ea&s;e and &s;elf &s;atis|faction did not long remain. They had been u&s;ed to arguments derived from religion and the vene|rablene&s;s of law. They had long ago &s;haken the&s;e from them as &s;o many prejudices. But my view of the &s;ubject appealed to principles which they could not conte&s;t, and had by no means the air of that cu&s;tomary reproof which is for ever dinned in our ears, without finding one re&s;pon&s;ive chord in our hearts. Finding them&s;elves urged with objections unexpected and cogent, &s;ome of tho&s;e to whom I addre&s;&s;ed them began to grow peevi&s;h and impa|tient of the importunate remon&s;trance. But this was by no means the ca&s;e with Mr. Raymond. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a candour that I have &s;eldom &s;een equalled. He was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear objections &s;o powerful to that which as a matter of &s;peculation he believed he had examined on all &s;ides. He revolved them with impartiality and care. He admitted them &s;lowly, but he at length fully admitted them. He had now but one rejoinder in re&s;erve.</P>
<P>Alas, Williams, &s;aid he, it would have been fortunate for me if the&s;e views had been pre&s;ented to me previou&s;ly to my embracing my pre&s;ent pro|fe&s;&s;ion. It is now too late. Tho&s;e very laws, which by a perception of their iniquity drove me to what I am, now preclude my return. God, we are told, judges of men by what they are at the pe|riod of judgment, and, whatever be their crimes, if they have &s;een and abjured the folly of tho&s;e crimes, receives them to favour. But the in&s;titutions of

<P>I WAS extremely affected by this plea. I could only an&s;wer that Mr. Raymond mu&s;t him&s;elf be the be&s;t judge of the cour&s;e it became him to hold; I tru&s;ted the ca&s;e was not &s;o de&s;perate as he ima|gined. This &s;ubject was pur&s;ued no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, and was in &s;ome degree driven from my thoughts by an incident of a very extraordinary nature. I have already mentioned the animo&s;ity that was enter|tained again&s;t me by the infernal portre&s;s of this &s;olitary man&s;ion. Jones, the expelled member of the gang, had been her particular favourite. She &s;ubmitted to his exile indeed, becau&s;e her genius felt &s;ubdued by the energy and inherent greatne&s;s of Mr. Raymond; but &s;he &s;ubmitted with mur|muring and di&s;content. Not daring to re&s;ent the conduct of the principal in this affair, &s;he collected all the bitterne&s;s of her &s;pirit again&s;t me. To the unpardonable offence I had thus committed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, were added the rea&s;onings I had lately offered again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of robbery. Robbery was a fundamental article in the creed of this hoary veteran, and &s;he li&s;tened to my objec|tions with the &s;ame unaffected a&s;toni&s;hment and horror, that an old woman of other habits would li&s;ten to one who objected to the agonies and di&s;|&s;olution of the Creator of the world, or to the gar|ment of imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s prepared to envelope the &s;ouls of the elect. Like the religious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;he was &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to avenge a ho&s;tility again&s;t her opinions with the weapons of &s;ublunary
<PB N="100" REF="028752_0328_0FDBD8DBDD3BC7A8">
warfare. Meanwhile I had &s;miled at the impo|tence of her malice, as an object of contempt, rather than alarm. She perceived, as I imagine, the &s;light e&s;timation in which I held her, and this did not a little increa&s;e the perturbation of her thoughts.</P>
<P>One day I was left alone with no other per&s;on in the hou&s;e than this &s;warthy &s;ybil. The thieves had &s;et out upon an expedition about two hours after &s;un&s;et on the preceding evening, and had not returned, as they were accu&s;tomed to do, before day-break the next morning. This was a circum|&s;tance that &s;ometimes occurred, and therefore did not produce any extraordinary alarm. At one time the &s;cent of prey would lead them beyond the bounds they had pre&s;cribed them&s;elves, and at an|other the fear of pur&s;uit; the life of a thief is always uncertain. The old woman had been pre|paring during the night for the meal to which they would expect to &s;it down, as &s;oon as might be after their return.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf I had learned from their habits to be indifferent to the regular return of the different parts of the day, and in &s;ome degree to turn day into night, and night into day. I had been now &s;everal weeks in this re&s;idence, and the &s;ea&s;on was con&s;iderably advanced. I had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours during the night in ruminating on my &s;ituation. The character and manners of the men among whom I lived were di&s;gu&s;ting to me. Their brutal ignorance, their ferocious habits, and their coar&s;e behaviour, in&s;tead of becoming more tolerable by cu&s;tom, hourly added force to my original aver|&s;ion. The uncommon vigour of their minds and acutene&s;s of their invention in the bu&s;ine&s;s they pur&s;ued, compared with the odiou&s;ne&s;s of that bu&s;ine&s;s and their habitual depravity, awakened in me &s;en&s;ations too painful to be endured. Moral

di&s;approbation, at lea&s;t in a mind un&s;ubdued by philo&s;ophy, I found to be one of the mo&s;t fertile &s;ources of di&s;quiet and unea&s;ine&s;s. From this pain the &s;ociety of Mr. Raymond by no means relieved me. He was indeed eminently &s;uperior to the vices of the re&s;t; but I did not le&s;s exqui&s;itely feel how much he was out of his place, how di&s;pro|portionably a&s;&s;ociated, or how contemptibly em|ployed. I had attempted to counteract the errors under which he and his companions laboured; but I had found the ob&s;tacles that pre&s;ented them&s;elves, much greater than I had imagined.</P>
<P>What was I to do? Was I to wait the i&s;&s;ue of this my mi&s;&s;ionary undertaking, or was I to with|draw my&s;elf immediately? When I withdrew, ought that to be done privately, or with an open avowal of my de&s;ign, and an endeavour to &s;upply by the force of example what was deficient in my arguments? It was certainly improper, as I de|clined all participation in the pur&s;uits of the&s;e men, did not contribute with my per&s;on to the ri&s;k by which they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and had no congeniality with their habits, that I &s;hould continue to re&s;ide with them any longer than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. There was one circum&s;tance that rendered this de|liberation particularly pre&s;&s;ing. They intended in a few days removing from their pre&s;ent habitation, to a haunt to which they were accu&s;tomed in a di&s;tant county. If I did not propo&s;e to continue with them, it would perhaps be wrong to accom|pany them in this removal. The &s;tate of calamity to which my inexorable per&s;ecutor had reduced me, had made the encounter even of a den of rob|bers a very fortunate adventure. But the time that had &s;ince elap&s;ed, had probably been &s;ufficient to relax the keenne&s;s of the que&s;t that was made after me. I &s;ighed for that &s;olitude and ob&s;curity, that
<PB N="102" REF="028752_0330_0FDBD8771E25E540">
retreat from the vexations of the world and the voice even of common fame, which I had propo&s;ed to my&s;elf when I broke my pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Such were the meditations which now occupied my mind. At length I grew fatigued with con|tinued contemplation, and to relieve my&s;elf, I pulled out a pocket Horace, the legacy of my beloved Brightwel! I read with avidity the epi&s;tle in which he &s;o beautifully de&s;cribes to Fu&s;cus the grammarian, the plea&s;ures of rural tranquillity and independence. By this time the &s;un ro&s;e from behind the ea&s;tern hills, and I open|ed my ca&s;ement to contemplate it. The day com|menced with peculiar brilliancy, and was accom|panied with all tho&s;e charms, which the poets of nature, as they have been &s;tyled, have &s;o much de|lighted to de&s;cribe. There was &s;omething in this &s;cene, particularly as &s;ucceeding to the active ex|ertions of intellect, that &s;oothed the mind to com|po&s;ure. In&s;en&s;ibly a confu&s;ed reverie invaded my faculties, I withdrew from the window, threw my|&s;elf upon the bed, and fell a&s;leep.</P>
<P>I do not recollect the preci&s;e images which in this &s;ituation pa&s;&s;ed through my thoughts, but I know that they concluded with the idea of &s;ome per&s;on, the agent of Mr. Falkland, approaching to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate me. This thought had probably been &s;ugge&s;ted, by the project I meditated of entering once again into the world, and throwing my&s;elf within the &s;phere of his po&s;&s;ible vengeance. I imagined that the de&s;ign of the murderer was to come upon me by &s;urpri&s;e, that I was aware of this de&s;ign, and yet by &s;ome fa&s;cination had no thought of evading it. I heard the &s;teps of the murderer as he cautiou&s;ly approached. I &s;eemed to li&s;ten to his con&s;trained, yet audible breathings. He came up to the corner where I was placed, and
<PB N="103" REF="028752_0331_0FDBD94D6D93F800">
then &s;topped. The idea became too terrible, I &s;tarted, opened my eyes, and beheld the execrable hag before mentioned &s;tanding over me with a butcher's hatchet. I &s;hifted my &s;ituation with a &s;peed that &s;eemed too &s;wift for volition, and the blow already aimed at my &s;cull, &s;unk impotent upon the bed. Before &s;he could wholly recover her po&s;ture I &s;prung upon her, &s;eized hold of the weapon, and had nearly wre&s;ted it from her. But in a moment &s;he re&s;umed her &s;trength and her de&s;perate pur|po&s;e, and we had a furious &s;truggle, &s;he impelled by inveterate malice, and I re&s;i&s;ting for my life. Her vigour was truly Amazonian, and at no time had I ever occa&s;ion to contend with a more formid|able opponent. Her glance was &s;udden and exact, and the &s;hock with which from time to time &s;he impelled her whole frame, inconceivably vehement. At length I was victorious, took from her her in|&s;trument of death, and threw her upon the ground. Till now the &s;obriety of her exertions had curbed her rage; but now &s;he gna&s;hed with her teeth, her eyes &s;eemed as if &s;tarting from their &s;ockets, and her body heaved with uncontroulable in&s;anity.</P>
<P>Ra&s;cal! devil! &s;he exclaimed, what do you mean to do to me?</P>
<P>Till now the &s;cene had pa&s;&s;ed uninterrupted by a &s;ingle word.</P>
<P>Nothing, I replied: begone, infernal witch! and leave me to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Leave you! No: I will thru&s;t my fingers through your ribs, and drink your blood!&mdash;You conquer me!&mdash;Ha, ha!&mdash;Yes, yes! you &s;hall!&mdash;I will &s;it upon you, and pre&s;s you to hell! I will roa&s;t you with brim&s;tone, and da&s;h your entrails into your eyes!&mdash;Ha, ha!&mdash;ha!</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he &s;prung up, and prepared to at|tack me with redoubled fury. I &s;eized her hands,
<PB N="104" REF="028752_0332_0FDBD87909D26398">
and compelled her to &s;it upon the bed. Thus re|&s;trained, &s;he continued to expre&s;s the tumult of her thoughts by grinning, by certain furious motions of her head, and by occa&s;ional vehement efforts to di&s;engage her&s;elf from my gra&s;p. The&s;e contor|tions and &s;tarts were of the nature of tho&s;e fits, in which the patients are commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to need three or four per&s;ons to hold them. But I found by experience that, under the circum&s;tances in which I was placed, my &s;ingle &s;trength was &s;uffi|cient. The &s;pectacle of her emotions was incon|ceivably frightful. Her violence at length however began to abate, and &s;he became per&s;uaded of the hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Let me go! &s;aid &s;he. Why do you hold me? I will not be held!</P>
<P>I wanted you gone from the fir&s;t, replied I. Are you contented to go now?</P>
<P>Yes, I tell you, mi&s;begotten villain! Yes, ra&s;cal!</P>
<P>I immediately loo&s;ed my hold. She flew to the door, and, holding it in her hand, &s;aid, I will be the death of you yet: you &s;hall not be your own man twenty-four hours longer! With the&s;e words &s;he &s;hut the door, and locked it upon me. An action &s;o totally unexpected &s;tartled me. Whither was &s;he gone? What was it &s;he intended? To peri&s;h by the machinations of &s;uch a hag as this, was a thought not to be endured. Death in any form, brought upon us by &s;urpri&s;e, and for which the mind has had no time to prepare, is inexpre&s;&s;i|bly terrible. My thoughts wandered in breathle&s;s horror and confu&s;ion, and all within was uproar. I endeavoured to break the door, but in vain. I went round the room in &s;earch of &s;ome tool to a&s;&s;i&s;t me. At length I ru&s;hed again&s;t it with a de&s;perate effort, to which it yielded, and had nearly thrown me from the top of the &s;tairs to the bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="028752_0333_0FDBD94F6E556788">
I de&s;cended with all po&s;&s;ible caution and vigi|lance. I entered the kitchen, but it was de&s;erted. I &s;earched every other apartment in vain. I went out of the hou&s;e; &s;till I di&s;covered nothing of my late a&s;&s;ailant. It was extraordinary: what could be become of her? what was I to conclude from her di&s;appearance? I reflected on her parting me|nace. "I &s;hould not be my own man twenty-four hours longer." It was my&s;terious; it did not &s;eem to be the menace of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>Suddenly the recollection of the hand bill brought to us by Wil&s;on ru&s;hed upon my memory. Was it po&s;&s;ible that &s;he alluded to that in her parting words? Would &s;he &s;et out upon &s;uch an expedi|tion by her&s;elf? Was it not dangerous to the whole fraternity, if without the &s;malle&s;t precaution &s;he &s;hould bring the officers of ju&s;tice into the mid&s;t of them? It was perhaps improbable &s;he would en|gage in an undertaking thus de&s;perate. It was not however ea&s;y to an&s;wer for the conduct of a per|&s;on in her &s;tate of mind. Should I wait, and ri&s;k the pre&s;ervation of my liberty upon the i&s;&s;ue?</P>
<P>To this que&s;tion I returned an immediate nega|tive. I had re&s;olved in a very &s;hort time to quit my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and the difference of a little &s;ooner or a little later could not be very material. It promi&s;ed to be neither agreeable nor prudent, for me to remain under the roof with a per&s;on who had manife&s;ted &s;uch a fierce and inexpiable ho&s;tility. But the con&s;ideration which had inexpre&s;&s;ibly the mo&s;t weight with me, belonged to the ideas of im|pri&s;onment, trial and death. The longer they had formed the &s;ubject of my contemplation, the more forcibly was I impelled to avoid them. I had en|tered upon a &s;y&s;tem of action for that purpo&s;e; I had already made many &s;acrifices; and I believed that I &s;hould never mi&s;carry in this project through
<PB N="106" REF="028752_0334_0FDBD87F75BBAD20">
any neglect of mine. The thought of what was re&s;erved for me by my pro&s;ecutors &s;ickened my very &s;oul; and the more intimately I was acquainted with oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice, the more deeply was I penetrated with the abhorrence to which they are entitled.</P>
<P>Such were the rea&s;ons that determined me, in|&s;tantly, abruptly, without leave-taking or acknow|ledgment for the peculiar and repeated favours I had received, to quit a habitation to which for &s;ix weeks I had apparently been indebted for protection, from trial, conviction and an ignominious death. I had come hither pennyle&s;s; I quitted my abode with the &s;um of a few guineas in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, Mr. Raymond having in&s;i&s;ted upon my taking a &s;hare, at the time that each man received his di|vidend from the common &s;tock. Though I had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the heat of the pur&s;uit again&s;t me would be &s;omewhat remitted by the time that had elap&s;ed, the magnitude of the mi&s;chief that in an un&s;avourable event might fall on me, determined me to neglect no imaginable precau|tion. I recollected the hand bill which was the &s;ource of my pre&s;ent alarm, and conceived that one of the principal dangers that threatened me was the recognition of my per&s;on, either by &s;uch as had previou&s;ly known me, or even by &s;trangers. It &s;eemed prudent therefore to di&s;gui&s;e it as effectu|ally as I could. For this purpo&s;e I had recour&s;e to a parcel of tattered garments that lay in one corner of our habitation. The di&s;gui&s;e I cho&s;e was that of a beggar. Upon this plan I threw off my &s;hirt. I tied a handkerchief about my head, with which I took care to cover one of my eyes. Over this I drew a piece of an old woollen night|cap. I &s;elected the wor&s;t apparel I could find, and this I reduced to a &s;till more deplorable con|dition,
<PB N="107" REF="028752_0335_0FDBD950EAE06120">
by rents that I purpo&s;ely made in various places. Thus equipped, I &s;urveyed my&s;elf in a looking-gla&s;s. I had rendered my appearance com|plete, nor would any one have &s;u&s;pected that I was not one of the fraternity to which I a&s;&s;umed to belong. I &s;aid, This is the form in which tyranny and inju&s;tice oblige me to &s;eek for refuge; but bet|ter, a thou&s;and times better is it, thus to incur contempt with the dregs of mankind, than to tru&s;t to the tender mercies of our &s;uperiors!</P>

<P>THE only rule that I laid down to my&s;elf in traver&s;ing the fore&s;t was to take a direction as oppo&s;ite as po&s;&s;ible to that which led to the &s;cene of my late impri&s;onment. After about two hours walking I arrived at the termination of this ruder &s;cene, and reached that part of the county which is inclo&s;ed and cultivated. Here I &s;at down by the &s;ide of a brook, and, pulling out a cru&s;t of bread which I had brought away with me, re&s;ted and refre&s;hed my&s;elf. While I continued in this place, I began to ruminate upon the plan I &s;hould lay down for my future proceedings; and my pro|pen&s;ity now led me, as it had done in a former in|&s;tance, to fix upon the capital which I believed, be&s;ide its other recommendations, would prove the &s;afe&s;t place for concealment. During the&s;e thoughts I &s;aw a couple of pea&s;ants pa&s;&s;ing at a &s;mall di&s;|tance, and enquired of them re&s;pecting the Lon|don road. By their de&s;cription I under&s;tood that the mo&s;t immediate way would be to repa&s;s a part of the fore&s;t, and that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to ap|proach con&s;iderably nearer to the county town than I was at the &s;pot which I had at pre&s;ent reached. I did not imagine that this could be a circum&s;tance of con&s;iderable importance. My di&s;gui&s;e appeared to be a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t momentary dan|ger; and I therefore took a path, though not the mo&s;t direct one, which led towards the point they &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="028752_0337_0FDBD95B411EE938">
The occurrences of the day were not very re|markable. As I pa&s;&s;ed along a road which lay in my way for a few miles, I &s;aw a carriage advancing in the oppo&s;ite direction. I debated with my&s;elf for a moment, whether I &s;hould pa&s;s it without notice, or &s;hould take this occa&s;ion by voice or ge&s;ture of making an e&s;&s;ay of my trade. This idle di&s;qui&s;ition was however &s;peedily driven from my mind when I perceived that the carriage was Mr. Falkland's. The &s;uddenne&s;s of the encounter &s;truck me with terror, though perhaps it would have been difficult for calm reflection to have di&s;covered any con&s;iderable danger. I withdrew from the road, and &s;kulked behind a hedge till it &s;hould have com|pletely gone by. I was too much occupied with my own feelings to venture to examine whether or no the terrible adver&s;ary of my peace were in the carriage. I per&s;uaded my&s;elf that he was. I look|ed after the equipage, and exclaimed, There you may &s;ee the luxurious accommodations and appen|dages of guilt, and here the forlornne&s;s that waits upon innocence!&mdash;I was to blame to imagine that my ca&s;e was &s;ingular in that re&s;pect. I only men|tion it to &s;how how the mo&s;t trivial circum&s;tance contributes to embitter the cup to the man of ad|ver&s;ity. The thought however was a tran&s;ient one. I had learned this le&s;&s;on from my &s;ufferings, not to indulge in the luxury of di&s;content. As my mind recovered its tranquillity, I began to enquire whe|ther the phenomenon I had ju&s;t &s;een could have any relation to my&s;elf. But though my mind was extremely inqui&s;itive and ver&s;atile in this re&s;pect, I could di&s;cover no &s;ufficient ground upon which to build any judgment in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>At night I entered a little public hou&s;e at the extremity of a village, and, &s;eating my&s;elf in a corner of the kitchen, a&s;ked for &s;ome bread and
<PB N="110" REF="028752_0338_0FDBD89662FB42E0">
chee&s;e. While I was &s;itting at my repa&s;t, three or four labourers came in for a little refre&s;hment after their work. Ideas re&s;pecting the inequality of rank pervade every order in &s;ociety; and, as my appear|ance was meaner and more contemptible than theirs, I found it expedient to give way to the&s;e gentry of a village alehou&s;e, and remove to an ob|&s;curer &s;tation. I was &s;urpri&s;ed and not a little &s;tartled to find them fall almo&s;t immediately into conver&s;ation about my hi&s;tory, whom with a &s;light variation of circum&s;tances they &s;tyled the notorious hou&s;ebreaker, Kit Williams.</P>
<P>Damn the fellow, &s;aid one of them, one never hears of any thing el&s;e. O' my life, I think he makes talk for the whole county.</P>
<P>That is very true, replied another. I was at the market town to-day to &s;ell &s;ome oats for my ma&s;ter, and there was a hue and cry, &s;ome of them thought they had got him, but it was a fal&s;e alarm.</P>
<P>That hundred guineas is a fine thing, rejoined the fir&s;t. I &s;hould be glad if &s;o be as how it fell in my way.</P>
<P>For the matter of that, &s;aid the traveller, I &s;hould like a hundred guineas as well as another. But I cannot be of your mind for all that. I &s;hould never think money would do me any good, that had been the means of bringing a Chri&s;tian creature to the gallows.</P>
<P>Poh, that is all my granny! Some folks mu&s;t be hanged to keep the wheels of our &s;tate folks a-going. Be&s;ide, I could forgive the fellow all his other robberies, but that he &s;hould have been &s;o hardened as to break the hou&s;e of his own ma&s;ter at la&s;t, that is too bad.</P>
<P>Lord, lord, replied the other, I &s;ee you know nothing of the matter! I will tell you how it was, as I learned it at the town. I que&s;tion whether he
<PB N="111" REF="028752_0339_0FDBD95DAB89FF00">
ever robbed his ma&s;ter at all. But hark you! you mu&s;t know as how that &s;quire Falkland was once tried for murder&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, yes, we know that.</P>
<P>Well, he was as innocent as the child unborn. But I &s;uppo&s;es as how he is a little &s;oft or &s;o. And &s;o Kit Williams&mdash;Kit is a devili&s;h cunning fellow, you may judge that from his breaking pri&s;on no le&s;s than five times,&mdash;&s;o, I &s;ay, he threatened to bring his ma&s;ter to trial at the '&s;izes all over again, and &s;o frightened him, and got money from him at divers times. Till at la&s;t one &s;quire Fore&s;ter, a relation of t'other, found it all out. And he made the hell of a rumpus, and &s;ent away Kit to pri&s;on in a twinky, and I believe he would have been hanged; for when two &s;quires lay their heads to|gether, they do not much matter law, you know; or el&s;e they twi&s;t the law to their own ends, I can|not exactly &s;ay which; but it is much at one, when the poor fellow's breath is out of his body.</P>
<P>Though this &s;tory was very circum&s;tantially told and with a &s;ufficient detail of particulars, it did not pa&s;s unque&s;tioned. Each man maintained the ju&s;tne&s;s of his own &s;tatement, and the di&s;pute was long and ob&s;tinately pur&s;ued. Hi&s;torians and commen|tators at length withdrew together. The terrors with which I was &s;eized when this conver&s;ation began, were extreme. I &s;tole a &s;ide-long glance to one quarter and another, to ob&s;erve if any man's attention were turned upon me. I trembled as if in an ague fit; and at fir&s;t felt continual impul&s;es to quit the hou&s;e and take to my heels. I drew clo&s;er in my corner, held a&s;ide my head, and &s;eem|ed from time to time to undergo a total revolution of the animal economy.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="028752_0340_0FDBD898A4159C20">
At length the tide of ideas turned. Perceiving they paid no attention to me, the recollection of the full &s;ecurity my di&s;gui&s;e afforded recurred &s;trongly to my thoughts, and I began inwardly to exult, though I did not venture to obtrude my&s;elf to examination. By degrees I began to be amu&s;ed at the ab&s;urdity of their tales, and the variety of the fal&s;ehoods I heard a&s;&s;erted around me. My &s;oul &s;eemed to expand; I felt a pride in the &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and lightne&s;s of heart with which I could li&s;ten to the &s;cene; and I determined to pro|long and heighten the enjoyment. Accordingly, when they were withdrawn, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to our ho&s;te&s;s, a buxom, bluff, good humoured widow, and a&s;ked what &s;ort of a man this Kit Williams might be? She replied that, as &s;he was informed, he was as hand&s;ome, likely a lad, as any in four counties round; and that &s;he loved him for his cleverne&s;s, by which be outwitted all the keepers they could &s;et over him, and made his way through &s;tone walls, as if they were &s;o many cobwebs. I ob&s;erved that the country was &s;o thoroughly alarmed, that I did not think it po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould e&s;cape the pur&s;uit that was &s;et up after him. This idea excited her immediate indignation; &s;he &s;aid &s;he hoped he was far enough away by this time, but, if not, &s;he wi&s;hed the cur&s;e of God might light on them that betrayed &s;o noble a fellow to a fatal end!&mdash;Though &s;he little thought that the per|&s;on of whom &s;he &s;poke was &s;o near her, yet the &s;incere and generous warmth with which &s;he in|tere&s;ted her&s;elf in my behalf, gave me con&s;iderable plea&s;ure. With this &s;en&s;ation to &s;weeten the fa|tigues of the day and the calamities of my &s;itua|tion, I retired from the kitchen to a neighbouring barn, laid my&s;elf down upon &s;ome &s;traw, and fell into a profound &s;leep.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="028752_0341_0FDBD95F2B437850">
The next day about noon as I was pur&s;uing my journey, I was overtaken by two men on hor&s;eback, who &s;topped me to enquire re&s;pecting a per&s;on that they &s;uppo&s;ed might have pa&s;&s;ed along that road. As they proceeded in their de&s;cription I perceived with a&s;toni&s;hment and terror that I was my&s;elf the per&s;on to whom their que&s;tions related. They en|tered into a tolerably accurate detail of the various characteri&s;tics by which my per&s;on might be&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed. They &s;aid, they had good rea&s;on to believe that I had been &s;een at a place in that county the very day before. While they were &s;peaking, a third per&s;on who had fallen behind came up, and my alarm was greatly increa&s;ed upon &s;eeing that this per&s;on was the &s;ervant of Mr. Fore&s;|ter, who had vi&s;ited me in pri&s;on about a fortnight before my e&s;cape. My be&s;t re&s;ource in this cri&s;is was compo&s;ure and apparent indifference. It was for|tunate for me that my di&s;gui&s;e was &s;o complete, that the eye of Mr. Falkland it&s;elf could &s;carcely have penetrated it. I had been aware for &s;ome time before that this was a refuge which events might make nece&s;&s;ary, and had endeavoured to arrange and methodi&s;e my ideas upon the &s;ubject. From my youth I had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable faci|lity in the art of imitation; and, when I quitted my retreat under the roof of Mr. Raymond, I adopted along with my beggar's attire a peculiar &s;louching and clowni&s;h gait to be u&s;ed whenever there &s;hould appear the lea&s;t chance of my being ob&s;erved, together with an Iri&s;h brogue which I had had an opportunity of &s;tudying in my pri&s;on. Such are the mi&s;erable expedients and &s;o great the &s;tudied artifice, which man, who never de&s;erves the name of manhood but in proportion as he is erect and independent, may find it nece&s;&s;ary to employ, for the purpo&s;e of eluding the inexorable
<PB N="114" REF="028752_0342_0FDBD8B20D32E418">
animo&s;ity and unfeeling tyranny of his fellow man! I had made u&s;e of this brogue, though I have not thought it nece&s;&s;ary to write it down in my narra|tive, in the conver&s;ation of the village alehou&s;e. Mr. Fore&s;ter's &s;ervant as he came up ob&s;erved that his companions were engaged in conver&s;ation with me; and, gue&s;&s;ing at the &s;ubject, a&s;ked whether they had gained any intelligence. He added to the information at which they had already hinted, that a re&s;olution was taken to &s;pare neither diligence nor expence for my di&s;covery and apprehen&s;ion, and that they were &s;atisfied that, if I were above ground and in the kingdom, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for me to e&s;cape them.</P>
<P>Every new incident that had occurred to me, thus tended to impre&s;s upon my mind the extreme danger to which I was expo&s;ed. I could almo&s;t have imagined that I was the &s;ole &s;ubject of general attention, and that the whole world was in arms to exterminate me. The very idea tingled through every fibre of my frame. But, terrible as it ap|peared to my imagination, it did but give new energy to my purpo&s;e; and I determined that I would not voluntarily re&s;ign the field, that is pro|perly &s;peaking my neck to the cord of the execu|tioner, notwith&s;tanding the greate&s;t &s;uperiority in my a&s;&s;ailants. But the incidents which had be|fallen me, though they did not change my purpo&s;e, induced me to examine over again the means by which that purpo&s;e might be effected. The con|&s;equence of this revi&s;al was to determine me to bend my cour&s;e to the neare&s;t &s;ea-port on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, and tran&s;port my&s;elf to Ireland. I cannot now tell what it was that inclined me to prefer this &s;cheme to that which I had originally formed. Perhaps the latter, which had been for &s;ome time pre&s;ent to my imagination, for that rea|&s;on
<PB N="115" REF="028752_0343_0FDBD9662A286390">
appeared the more obvious of the two; and I found an appearance of complexity, which the mind did not &s;tay to explain to it&s;elf, in &s;ub&s;ti|tuting the other in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>I arrived without farther impediment at the place from which I intended to &s;ail, enquired for a ve&s;&s;el which I found ready to put to &s;ea in a few hours, and agreed with the captain for my pa&s;&s;age. Ireland had to me the di&s;advantage of being a de|pendency of the Briti&s;h government, and therefore a place of le&s;s &s;ecurity than mo&s;t other countries which are divided from it by the ocean. To judge from the diligence with which I &s;eemed to be pur|&s;ued in England, it was not improbable that the zeal of my per&s;ecutors might follow me to the other &s;ide of the channel. It was however &s;uffici|ently agreeable to my mind that I was upon the point of being removed one &s;tep farther from the danger which was &s;o grievous to my imagination.</P>
<P>Could there be any peril in the &s;hort interval that was to elap&s;e before the ve&s;&s;el was to weigh anchor, and quit the Engli&s;h &s;hore? Probably not. A very &s;hort time had intervened between my de|termination for the &s;ea and my arrival at this place; and, if any new alarm had been given to my per|&s;ecutors, it proceeded from the old woman a very few days before. I hoped I had anticipated their diligence. Meanwhile that I might neglect no rea&s;onable precaution, I went in&s;tantly on board, re&s;olved that I would not unnece&s;&s;arily, by walking in the &s;treets of the town, expo&s;e my&s;elf to any untoward accident.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>THE time was now nearly elap&s;ed that was pre&s;cribed for our &s;tay, and orders for weighing anchor were every moment expected, when we were hailed by a boat from the &s;hore with two other men in it be&s;ide tho&s;e that rowed. They entered our ve&s;&s;el in an in&s;tant. They were officers of ju&s;tice. The pa&s;&s;engers, five per&s;ons be&s;ide my&s;elf, were ordered upon deck for exami|nation. I was inexpre&s;&s;ibly di&s;turbed at the oc|currence of &s;uch a circum&s;tance in &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a moment. I took it for granted that it was of me that they were in &s;earch. Was it po&s;&s;ible that by any unaccountable accident they &s;hould have got an intimation of my di&s;gui&s;e? It was infinitely more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to encounter them upon this nar|row &s;tage and under the&s;e pointed circum&s;tances, than, as I had before encountered my pur&s;uers, under the appearance of an indifferent per&s;on. My recollection however did not for&s;ake me. I confided in my con&s;cious di&s;gui&s;e and my Iri&s;h brogue, as a rock of dependence again&s;t all acci|dents.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner did we appear upon deck than to my great con&s;ternation I could ob&s;erve the attention of our gue&s;ts principally turned upon me. They a&s;ked a few frivolous que&s;tions of &s;uch of my fel|low pa&s;&s;engers as happened to be neare&s;t to them; and then turning to me enquired my name, who I was, whence I came, and what had brought me there? I had &s;carcely opened my mouth to reply,
<PB N="117" REF="028752_0345_0FDBD967688609E8">
when with one con&s;ent they laid hold of me, &s;aid I was their pri&s;oner, and declared that my accent, together with the corre&s;pondence of my per&s;on, would be &s;ufficient to convict me before any court in England. I was hurried out of the ve&s;&s;el into the boat in which they came, and &s;eated between them, as if by way of precaution le&s;t I &s;hould &s;pring overboard and by any means e&s;cape them.</P>
<P>I now took it for granted that I was once more in the power of Mr. Falkland, and the idea was inexpre&s;&s;ibly mortifying and afflictive to my ima|gination. E&s;cape from his pur&s;uit, freedom from his tyranny, were objects upon which my whole &s;oul was bent; could no human ingenuity and ex|ertion effect them? Did his power reach through all &s;pace, and his eye penetrate every concealment? Was he like that my&s;terious being, to protect us from who&s;e fierce revenge mountains and hills we are told might fall on us in vain! No idea is more heart-&s;ickening and tremendous than this. But in my ca&s;e it was not a &s;ubject of rea&s;oning or of faith; I could derive no comfort either openly from unbelief, or &s;ecretly from the remotene&s;s and incomprehen&s;ibility of the conception; it was an affair of &s;en&s;e; I felt the fangs of the tyger &s;triking deep into my heart.</P>
<P>But, though this impre&s;&s;ion were at fir&s;t ex|ceedingly &s;trong, and accompanied with its u&s;ual attendants in dejection and pu&s;illanimity of &s;pirit, yet my mind &s;oon began as it were mechanically, to turn upon the con&s;ideration of the di&s;tance be|tween this &s;ea-port and my county pri&s;on, and the various opportunities of e&s;cape that might offer them&s;elves in the interval. My fir&s;t duty was to avoid betraying my&s;elf more than it might after|wards appear I was betrayed already. It was po&s;|&s;ible that, though apprehended, my apprehen&s;ion
<PB N="118" REF="028752_0346_0FDBD8B8B2F97428">
might have been determined on upon &s;ome &s;light &s;core, and that by my dexterity I might render my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion as &s;udden as my arre&s;t had been. It was even po&s;&s;ible that I had been &s;eized through a mi&s;|take, and that the pre&s;ent mea&s;ure might have no connection with Mr. Falkland's affair. Upon every &s;uppo&s;ition it was my bu&s;ine&s;s to gain information, and not to communicate it.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found the benefits of this re&s;olution. In my pa&s;&s;age from the &s;hip to the town I did not utter a word. My conductors commented on my &s;ulkine&s;s, but remarked that it would avail me nothing, I &s;hould infallibly &s;wing, as it was never known that any body got off; who was tried for robbing his maje&s;ty's mail. It is ea&s;y to conceive the lightne&s;s of heart which was communicated to me by the&s;e words: I per&s;i&s;ted however in the &s;ilence I had meditated. From the re&s;t of their conver&s;ation, which was &s;ufficiently voluble, I learned that the mail from Edinburgh to London had been robbed about ten days before by two Iri&s;hmen, that one of them was already &s;ecured, and that I was taken up upon &s;u&s;picion of being the other. They had a de&s;cription of his per&s;on which, though, as I afterwards found, it di&s;agreed from mine in &s;everal material articles, appeared to them to tally to the minute&s;t tittle. The intelli|gence that the whole proceeding again&s;t me was founded in a mi&s;take, took an oppre&s;&s;ive load from my mind. I believed that I &s;hould immediately be able to e&s;tabli&s;h my innocence to the &s;atisfaction of any magi&s;trate in the kingdom; and, though cro&s;&s;ed in my plans, and thwarted in my de&s;ign of quitting the i&s;land even after I was already at &s;ea, this was but a trifling inconvenience compared with what I had had but too much rea&s;on to fear.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="028752_0347_0FDBD96DA3BB3398">
As &s;oon as we came a&s;hore I was conducted to the hou&s;e of a ju&s;tice of peace, a man who had formerly been the captain of a collier, but who, having been &s;ucce&s;sful in the world, had quitted this wandering life, and for &s;ome years had had the honour to repre&s;ent his maje&s;ty's per&s;on. We were detained for &s;ome time in a &s;ort of anti-room, waiting his reverence's lei&s;ure. The per&s;ons by whom I had been taken up were experienced in their trade, and in&s;i&s;ted upon employing this in|terval in &s;earching me, in pre&s;ence of two of his wor&s;hip's &s;ervants. They found upon me fifteen guineas and &s;ome &s;ilver. They required me to &s;trip my&s;elf perfectly naked, that they might examine whether I had bank notes concealed any where about my per&s;on. They took up the detached par|cels of my mi&s;erable attire as I threw it from me, and felt them one by one to di&s;cover whether the articles of which they were in &s;earch might by any device be &s;own up in them. To all this I &s;ubmit|ted without murmuring. It might probably come to the &s;ame thing at la&s;t, and &s;ummary ju&s;tice was &s;ufficiently coincident with my views, my principal object being to get as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible out of the clutches of the re&s;pectable per&s;ons who now had me in cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>This operation was &s;carcely completed, before we were directed to be u&s;hered into his wor&s;hip's apartment. My accu&s;ers opened the charge, and told him that they had been ordered to this town upon an intimation that one of the per&s;ons who robbed the Edinburgh mail was to be &s;ound here; and that they had taken me on board a ve&s;&s;el which was by this time under &s;ail for Ireland. Well, &s;ays his wor&s;hip, that is your &s;tory; now let us hear what account the gentleman gives of him|&s;elf. What is your name, ha, &s;irrah? and from
<PB N="120" REF="028752_0348_0FDBD8BAA42A7FC8">
what part of Tipperary are you plea&s;ed to come? I had already taken my determination upon this article; and, the moment I learned the particu|lars of the charge again&s;t me, re&s;olved, for the pre|&s;ent at lea&s;t, to lay a&s;ide my Iri&s;h accent, and &s;peak my native tongue. This I had done in the very few words I had &s;poken to my conductors in the anti-room: they &s;tared at the metamorpho&s;is, but they had gone too far for it to be po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould retract in con&s;i&s;tence with their honour. I now told the ju&s;tice that I was no Iri&s;hman, nor had ever been in that country: I was a native of England. This occa&s;ioned a con&s;ulting of the de|po&s;ition in which my per&s;on was &s;uppo&s;ed to be de&s;cribed, and which my conductors had brought along with them for their direction. To be &s;ure that required that the offender &s;hould be an Iri&s;h|man.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving his wor&s;hip he&s;itate, I thought this was the time to pu&s;h the matter a little farther. I referred to the paper, and &s;hewed him that the de&s;cription neither tallied as to height nor com|plexion. But then it did as to years and the colour of the hair; and it was not this gentleman's habit, as he informed me, to &s;quabble about trifles, or to let a man's neck out of the halter for a pretended flaw of a few inches in his &s;tature. If a man were too &s;hort, he &s;aid, there was no remedy like a little &s;tretching. The mi&s;calculation in my ca&s;e hap|pened to be the oppo&s;ite way, but his reverence did not think proper to lo&s;e his je&s;t. Upon the whole he was &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s how to proceed.</P>
<P>My conductors ob&s;erved this, and began to trem|ble for the reward, which two hours ago they thought as good as in their own pocket. To retain me in cu&s;tody they judged to be a &s;afe &s;pecula|tion; if it turned out a mi&s;take at la&s;t, they felt

little apprehen&s;ion of a &s;uit for fal&s;e impri&s;onment from a poor man accoutred as I was in rags. They therefore urged his wor&s;hip to comply with their views. They told him that to be &s;ure the evidence again&s;t me did not prove &s;o &s;trong, as for their part they heartily wi&s;hed it had, but that there were a number of &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances re&s;pecting me. When I was brought up to them upon the deck of the ve&s;&s;el, I &s;poke as fine an Iri&s;h brogue as one &s;hall hear in a &s;ummer's day; and now all at once there was not the lea&s;t particle of it left. In &s;earching me they had &s;ound upon me fifteen guineas; how &s;hould a poor beggar lad, &s;uch as I appeared, come hone&s;tly by fifteen guineas? Be&s;ide, when they had &s;tripped me naked, though my dre&s;s was &s;o &s;habby, my &s;kin had all the &s;leekne&s;s of a gentleman. In fine, for what pur|po&s;e could a poor beggar, who had never been in Ireland in his life, want to tran&s;port him&s;elf to that country? It was as clear as the &s;un that I was no better than I &s;hould be. This rea&s;oning, together with &s;ome &s;ignificant winks and ge&s;tures between the ju&s;tice and the plaintiffs, brought him over to their way of thinking. He &s;aid, I mu&s;t go to War|wick, where it &s;eems the other robber was at pre|&s;ent in cu&s;tody, and be confronted with him; and if then every thing appeared fair and &s;atisfactory, I &s;hould be di&s;charged.</P>
<P>No intelligence could be more terrible than that which was contained in the&s;e words. That I, who had found the whole country in arms again&s;t me, who was expo&s;ed to a pur&s;uit &s;o peculiarly vigilant and penetrating, &s;hould now be dragged to the very centre of the kingdom, without power of accom|modating my&s;elf to circum&s;tances, and under the immediate cu&s;tody of the officers of ju&s;tice, &s;eem|ed to my ears almo&s;t the &s;ame thing as if they had pronounced upon me a &s;entence of death! I
<PB N="122" REF="028752_0350_0FDBD8BBC4B3CBE0">
&s;trenuou&s;ly urged the inju&s;tice of this proceeding. I ob&s;erved to the magi&s;trate that it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be the per&s;on at whom the de&s;cription pointed. It required an Iri&s;hman; I was no Iri&s;h|man. It de&s;cribed a per&s;on &s;horter than I; a cir|cum&s;tance of all others the lea&s;t capable of being counterfeited. There was not the &s;lighte&s;t rea&s;on for detaining me in cu&s;tody. I had been already di&s;appointed of my voyage and lo&s;t the money I had paid down through the officiou&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e gentlemen in apprehending me. I a&s;&s;ured his wor|&s;hip that every delay under my circum&s;tances was of the utmo&s;t importance to me. It was impo&s;&s;i|ble to devi&s;e a greater injury to be inflicted on me, than the propo&s;al that, in&s;tead of being permitted to proceed upon my voyage, I &s;hould be &s;ent un|der arre&s;t into the heart of the kingdom.</P>
<P>My remon&s;trances were in vain. The ju&s;tice was by no means inclined to dige&s;t the being ex|po&s;tulated with in this manner by a per&s;on in the habiliments of a beggar. In the mid&s;t of my ad|dre&s;s he would have &s;ilenced me for my imperti|nence, but that I &s;poke with an earne&s;tne&s;s with which he was wholly unable to contend. When I had fini&s;hed, he told me that it was all to no pur|po&s;e, and that it might have been better for me if I had &s;hown my&s;elf le&s;s in&s;olent. It was clear that I was a vagabond and a &s;u&s;picious per&s;on. The more earne&s;t I &s;howed my&s;elf to get off, the more rea&s;on there was he &s;hould keep me fa&s;t. Perhaps after all I &s;hould turn out to be the felon in que&s;|tion. But, if I was not that, he had no doubt I was wor&s;e; a poacher, or for what he knew a murderer. He had a kind of a notion that he had &s;een my face before about &s;ome &s;uch affair; out of all doubt I was an old offender. He had it in his choice to &s;end me to hard labour as a vagrant upon the &s;trength of my appearance and the contradic|tions
<PB N="123" REF="028752_0351_0FDBD9732AB87A48">
in my &s;tory, or to order me to Warwick; and out of the &s;pontaneous goodne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition he cho&s;e the milder alternative. He could a&s;&s;ure me I &s;hould not &s;lip through his fingers. It was of more benefit to his maje&s;ty's government to hang one &s;uch fellow as he &s;u&s;pected me to be, than out of mi&s;guided tenderne&s;s to concern one|&s;elf for the good of all the beggars in the nation.</P>
<P>Finding that it was impo&s;&s;ible to work on a man, &s;o fully impre&s;&s;ed with his own dignity and im|portance and my utter in&s;ignificance, in the way I de&s;ired, I claimed that at lea&s;t the money taken from my per&s;on &s;hould be re&s;tored to me. This was granted. His wor&s;hip perhaps &s;u&s;pected that he had &s;tretched a point in what he had already done, and was therefore the le&s;s unwilling to relax in this incidental circum&s;tance. My conductors did not oppo&s;e them&s;elves to this indulgence, for a rea&s;on that will appear in the &s;equel. The ju&s;tice however enlarged upon his clemency in this pro|ceeding. He did not know whether he was not exceeding the &s;pirit of his commi&s;&s;ion in complying with my demand. So much money in my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion could not be hone&s;tly come by. But it was his temper to &s;often, as far as could be done with propriety, the &s;trict letter of the law.</P>
<P>There were cogent rea&s;ons why the gentlemen who had originally taken me into cu&s;tody, cho&s;e that I &s;hould continue in their cu&s;tody, when my examination was over. Every man is in his dif|ferent mode &s;u&s;ceptible to a &s;en&s;e of honour; and they did not choo&s;e to encounter the di&s;grace that would accrue to them if ju&s;tice had been done. Every man is in &s;ome degree influenced by the love of power; and they were willing I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> owe any benefit I received, to their &s;overeign grace and be|nignity, and not to the mere rea&s;on of the ca&s;e. It was not however an un&s;ub&s;tantial honour and bar|ren
<PB N="124" REF="028752_0352_0FDBD8BDA1F56BA0">
power that formed the object of their pur&s;uit: no, their views were deeper than that. In a word, though they cho&s;e that I &s;hould retire from the &s;eat of ju&s;tice as I had come before it, a pri&s;oner, yet the tenour of my examination had obliged them in &s;pite of them&s;elves to &s;u&s;pect, that I was innocent of the charge they alleged again&s;t me. Appre|hen&s;ive therefore that the hundred guineas that had been offered as a reward for taking the robber, was completely out of the que&s;tion in the pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s, they were contented to &s;trike at &s;maller game. Having conducted me to an inn, and given directions re&s;pecting a vehicle for the journey, they took me a&s;ide, while one of them addre&s;&s;ed me in the following manner:</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my lad, how the ca&s;e &s;tands; heigh for Warwick is the word! and, when we are got there, what may happen then I will not pretend for to &s;ay. Whether you are innocent or no is no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine; but you are not &s;uch a chicken as to &s;uppo&s;e, if &s;o be as you are innocent, that that will make your game altogether &s;ure. You &s;ay, your bu&s;ine&s;s calls you another way, and as how you are in ha&s;te: I have not the heart to cro&s;s any man in his concerns, if I can help it. If there|fore you will give us them there fifteen &s;hiners, why &s;nug is the word. They are of no u&s;e to you; a beggar, you know, is always at home. For the matter of that we could have had them in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s as you &s;aw at the ju&s;tice's. But I am a man of principle; I loves to do things above board, and &s;corns to extort a &s;hilling from any man.</P>
<P>He who is tinctured with principles of moral di&s;crimination, is apt upon occa&s;ion to be run away with by his feelings in that re&s;pect, and to forget the immediate intere&s;t of the moment. I confe&s;s that the fir&s;t &s;entiment excited in my mind by this
<PB N="125" REF="028752_0353_0FDBD9742C355A30">
overture was that of indignation. I was irre&s;i&s;t|ably impelled to give utterance to this feeling, and po&s;tpone for a moment the con&s;ideration of the future. I replied with the &s;everity which &s;o ba&s;e a proceeding appeared to de&s;erve. My bear-leaders were con&s;iderably &s;urpri&s;ed with my firmne&s;s, but &s;eemed to think it beneath them to conte&s;t with me the principles I delivered. He who had made the overture contented him&s;elf with replying, Well, well, my lad, do as you will; you are not the fir&s;t man that has been hanged rather than part with a few guineas. His words did not pa&s;s un|heeded by me. They were &s;trikingly applicable to my &s;ituation, and I was determined not to &s;uffer the occa&s;ion to e&s;cape me unimproved.</P>
<P>The pride of the&s;e gentlemen however was too great to admit of farther parley for the pre&s;ent. They left me abruptly; having fir&s;t ordered an old man, the father of the landlady, to &s;tay in the room with me while they were ab&s;ent. The old man they ordered for &s;ecurity to lock the door and put the key in his pocket, at the &s;ame time mention|ing below &s;tairs the &s;tation in which they had left me, that the people of the hou&s;e might have an eye upon what went forward, and not &s;uffer me to e&s;cape. What was the intention of this manoeuvre I am unable certainly to pronounce. Probably it was a &s;ort of compromi&s;e between their pride and their avarice, being de&s;irous for &s;ome rea&s;on or other to drop me as &s;oon as convenient, and there|fore determining to wait the re&s;ult of my private meditations on the propo&s;al they had made.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>THEY were no &s;ooner withdrawn than I ca&s;t my eye upon the old man, and found &s;omething extremely venerable and intere&s;ting in his appear|ance. His form was above the middle &s;ize. It indicated that his &s;trength had once been con&s;ider|able; nor was it at this time by any means anni|hilated. His hair was in con&s;iderable quantity, and was as white as the driven &s;now. His com|plexion was healthful and ruddy, at the &s;ame time that his face was furrowed with wrinkles. In his eye there was remarkable vivacity, and his whole countenance was &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of good nature. The boori&s;hne&s;s of his rank in &s;ociety was lo&s;t, in the cultivation his mind had derived from habits of &s;en&s;ibility and benevolence.</P>
<P>The view of his figure immediately introduced a train of ideas into my mind re&s;pecting the ad|vantage to be drawn from the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a per&s;on. The attempt to take any &s;tep without his con&s;ent was hopele&s;s, for, though I &s;hould &s;ucceed with regard to him, he could ea&s;ily give the alarm to other per&s;ons who would no doubt be within call. Add to which, I could &s;carcely have prevail|ed on my&s;elf to offer any offence to a per&s;on who&s;e fir&s;t appearance &s;o &s;trongly engaged my affection and e&s;teem. In reality my thoughts were turned into a different channel. I was impre&s;&s;ed with an ardent wi&s;h, to be able to call this man my bene|factor. Pur&s;ued by a train of ill-fortune, I could
<PB N="127" REF="028752_0355_0FDBD97AFA024010">
no longer con&s;ider my&s;elf as a member of &s;ociety. I was a &s;olitary being, cut off from the expectation of &s;ympathy, kindne&s;s and the good-will of man|kind. I was &s;trongly impelled by the &s;ituation in which the pre&s;ent moment placed me, to indulge in a luxury which my de&s;tiny &s;eemed to have de|nied. I could not conceive of the &s;malle&s;t com|pari&s;on between the idea of deriving my liberty from the &s;pontaneous kindne&s;s of a worthy and ex|cellent mind, and that of being indebted for it to the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and ba&s;ene&s;s of the wor&s;t members of &s;ociety. It was thus that I allowed my&s;elf in the wantonne&s;s of refinement even in the mid&s;t of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Guided by the&s;e &s;entiments, I reque&s;ted his at|tention to the circum&s;tances by which I had been brought into my pre&s;ent &s;ituation. He immediate|ly &s;ignified his a&s;&s;ent, and &s;aid he would chearfully li&s;ten to any thing I thought proper to communi|cate. I told him the per&s;ons who had ju&s;t left me in charge with him, had come to this town for the purpo&s;e of apprehending &s;ome per&s;on who had been guilty of robbing the mail; that they had cho&s;en to take me up under this warrant, and had con|ducted me before a ju&s;tice of the peace; that they had &s;oon detected their mi&s;take, the per&s;on in que&s;|tion being an Iri&s;hman, and differing from me both in country and &s;tature; but that by collu&s;ion be|tween them and the ju&s;tice they were permitted to retain me in cu&s;tody, and pretended to undertake to conduct me to Warwick to confront me with my accomplice; that in &s;earching me at the ju&s;|tice's they had found a &s;um of money in my po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion which excited their cupidity, and that they had ju&s;t been propo&s;ing to me to give me my li|berty upon condition of my &s;urrendering this &s;um into their hands. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances I re|que&s;ted
<PB N="128" REF="028752_0356_0FDBD8C7A82D37A0">
him to con&s;ider whether he would wi&s;h to render him&s;elf the in&s;trument of their extortion. I put my&s;elf into his hands, and &s;olemnly averred the truth of the facts I had ju&s;t &s;tated. If he would a&s;&s;i&s;t me in my e&s;cape, it could have no other effect than to di&s;appoint the ba&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of my conductors. I would upon no account expo&s;e him to any real inconvenience; but I was well a&s;|&s;ured that the &s;ame genero&s;ity that prompted him to a good deed, would enable him effectually to vindicate it when done; and that tho&s;e who de|tained me, when they had lo&s;t &s;ight of their prey, would feel covered with confu&s;ion, and not dare to take another &s;tep in the affair.</P>
<P>The old man li&s;tened to what I related with cu|rio&s;ity and intere&s;t. He &s;aid that he had always felt an abhorrence to the &s;ort of people who had me in their hands, that he had an aver&s;ion to the ta&s;k they had ju&s;t impo&s;ed upon him, but that he could not refu&s;e &s;ome little di&s;agreeable offices to oblige his daughter and &s;on-in-law. He had no doubt, from my countenance and manner, of the truth of what I had a&s;&s;erted to him. It was an extraordinary reque&s;t I had made, and he did not know what had induced me to think him the &s;ort of per&s;on to whom it might properly be made. In reality however his habits of thinking were uncom|mon, and he felt more than half inclined to act as I de&s;ired. One thing at lea&s;t he would de&s;ire of me in return, which was to be faithfully informed in &s;ome degree re&s;pecting the per&s;on he was a&s;ked to oblige. What was my name?</P>
<P>The que&s;tion came upon me unprepared. But, whatever might be the con&s;equences, I could not bear to deceive the per&s;on by whom it was put, and in the circum&s;tances under which it was put.
<PB N="129" REF="028752_0357_0FDBD97C6A880FC0">
The practice of perpetual fal&s;hood is too painful a ta&s;k. I replied that my name was Williams.</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed His eye was fixed upon me. I &s;aw his complexion alter at the repetition of that word. He proceeded with vi&s;ible anxiety.</P>
<P>My chri&s;tian name?</P>
<P>Caleb.</P>
<P>Good God! it could not be&mdash;? He conjured me by every thing that was &s;acred to an|&s;wer him faithfully to one que&s;tion more. I was not?&mdash;no, it was impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;the per&s;on who had formerly lived &s;ervant with Mr. Falkland of&mdash;?</P>
<P>I told him that, whatever might be the meaning of his que&s;tion, I would an&s;wer him truly. I was the individual he mentioned.</P>
<P>As I uttered the&s;e words, the old man ro&s;e from his &s;eat. He was &s;orry that fortune had been &s;o unpropitious to him, as for him ever to have &s;et eyes upon me! I was a mon&s;ter with whom the very earth groaned!</P>
<P>I intreated that he would &s;uffer me to explain this new mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, as he had done in the former in&s;tance. I had no doubt that I &s;hould do it equally to his &s;atisfaction:</P>
<P>No! no! no! he would upon no con&s;ideration admit that his ears &s;hould &s;uffer &s;uch contamina|tion. This ca&s;e and the other were very different. There was no criminal upon the face of the earth, no murderer, half &s;o dete&s;table, as the per&s;on who could prevail upon him&s;elf to utter the charges I had done by way of recrimination again&s;t &s;o gene|rous a ma&s;ter.&mdash;The old man was in a perfect ago|ny with the recollection.</P>
<P>At length he calmed him&s;elf enough to &s;ay he &s;hould never cea&s;e to grieve that he had held a mo|ment's parley with me. He did not know what was the conduct that &s;evere ju&s;tice required of
<PB N="130" REF="028752_0358_0FDBD8CD2F8B1CB0">
him; but, &s;ince he had come into the knowledge of who I was only by my own confe&s;&s;ion, it was irreconcilably repugnant to his feelings to make u&s;e of that knowledge to my injury. Here there|fore all relation between us cea&s;ed; and indeed it would be an abu&s;e of words to con&s;ider me in the light of a human creature. He would do me no mi&s;chief; but then on the other hand he would not for the world be any way a&s;&s;i&s;ting and abetting me.</P>
<P>I was inexpre&s;&s;ibly affected at the abhorrence this good and benevolent creature expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t me. I could not be &s;ilent; I endeavoured once and again to prevail upon him to hear me. But his determination was unalterable. Our conte&s;t la&s;ted for &s;ome time, and he at length terminated it by ringing the bell, and calling up the waiter. A very little while after this my conductors enter|ed, and the&s;e two other per&s;ons withdrew.</P>
<P>It was a part of the &s;ingularity of my fate that it hurried me from one &s;pecies of anxiety and di&s;|tre&s;s to another, too rapidly to &s;uffer any one of them to &s;ink deeply into my mind. I am apt to believe in the retro&s;pect that half the calamities I was de&s;tined to endure would infalliby have over|whelmed and de&s;troyed me. But, as it was, I had no lei&s;ure to chew the cud upon cro&s;s accidents as they befel me, but was under the nece&s;&s;ity of for|getting them to guard again&s;t peril that the next moment &s;eemed ready to cru&s;h me. The behavi|our of this incomparable and amiable old man cut me to the heart. It was a dreadful progno&s;tic for all my future life. But, as I have ju&s;t ob&s;erved, my conductors entered, and another &s;ubject called imperiou&s;ly upon my attention. I could have been content, mortified as I was at this in&s;tant, to have been &s;hut up in &s;ome impenetrable &s;olitude, and to
<PB N="131" REF="028752_0359_0FDBD9835A468448">
have wrapped my&s;elf up in incon&s;olable mi&s;ery. But the grief I endured had not &s;uch power over me, as that I could be content to ri&s;k the being led to the gallows. The love of life, and &s;till more a hatred again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;teeled my heart again&s;t that &s;pecies of inertion. In the &s;cene that had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed I had indulged, as I have &s;aid, in a wantonne&s;s and luxury of refinement. It was time that that indulgence &s;hould be brought to a period. It was dangerous to trifle any more upon the brink of fate; and, penetrated as I was with &s;adne&s;s by the re&s;ult of my la&s;t attempt, I was little di&s;po&s;ed to any unnece&s;&s;ary circumambulation. I was exactly in the temper in which the gentlemen who had me in their power, would have de&s;ired to find me. Accordingly we entered upon immediate bu&s;ine&s;s; and, after &s;ome chaffering, they agreed to accept eleven guineas as the price of my freedom. To pre&s;erve however the charine&s;s of their reputation, they in&s;i&s;ted upon conducting me with them for a few miles on the out&s;ide of a &s;tage coach. They then pretended that the road they had to travel lay in a cro&s;s-country direction; and, having quitted the vehicle, they &s;uffered me, almo&s;t as &s;oon as it was out of &s;ight, to &s;hake off this trouble&s;ome a&s;|&s;ociation, and follow my own inclinations. It may be worth remarking by the way, that the&s;e fellows outwitted them&s;elves at their own trade. They had laid hold of me at fir&s;t under the idea of a prize of a hundred guineas: they had &s;ince been glad to accept a compo&s;ition of eleven; but, if they had retained me a little longer in their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, they would have found the po&s;&s;ibility of ac|quiring the &s;um that had originally excited their pur&s;uit, upon a different &s;core.</P>
<P>The mi&s;chances that had befallen me in my late attempt to e&s;cape from my pur&s;uers by having re|cour&s;e to the &s;ea, deterred me from the thought
<PB N="132" REF="028752_0360_0FDBD8CE6AD01D10">
of repeating the &s;ame experiment. I therefore once more returned to the &s;ugge&s;tion of hiding my&s;elf, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, amid&s;t the crowds of the metropolis. Meanwhile I by no means thought proper to venture by the direct route, and the le&s;s &s;o as that was the cour&s;e which would be &s;teered by my late conductors; but took my road along the borders of Wales. The only incident worth relating in this place, occurred in a pro|ject I thought proper to adopt for cro&s;&s;ing the Se|vern in a particular point. The mode of cro&s;&s;ing was by a ferry; and by &s;ome &s;trange inadvertence I lo&s;t my way &s;o completely that I was wholly un|able that night to reach the ferry, and arrive at the town which I had de&s;tined for my repo&s;e.</P>
<P>It was by a &s;ingular fatality that this petty di&s;|appointment, in the mid&s;t of the overwhelming con&s;iderations that might have been expected to en|gro&s;s every thought of my mind, was borne by me with particular impatience. I was that day un|commonly fatigued. Previou&s;ly to the time when I mi&s;took, or at lea&s;t was aware of the mi&s;take of the road, the &s;ky had become exceedingly black and lowering, and &s;oon after the clouds bur&s;t down in &s;heets of rain. I was then in the mid&s;t of a heath, without tree or covering of any &s;ort to &s;hel|ter me. I was thoroughly drenched in a moment. In this uncomfortable &s;tate I proceeded with a &s;ort of &s;ullen determination. By and by the rain gave place to a &s;torm of hail. The hail-&s;tones were large and frequent. I was ill defended from them by the mi&s;erable covering I wore, and they &s;eemed to cut me in a thou&s;and directions. The hail|&s;torm &s;ub&s;ided, and was again &s;ucceeded by a heavy rain. It was at this time I perceived that I had totally deviated from my way. I could di&s;cover neither man, nor bea&s;t, nor habitation of any
<PB N="133" REF="028752_0361_0FDBD98568126088">
kind. I walked on, con&s;ulting at every turn the path it would be proper for me to pur&s;ue, and in no in&s;tance able to di&s;cern a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for rejecting the one and preferring the other. My mind was in a mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate and repin|ing &s;tate. I muttered imprecations and murmur|ing, as I pa&s;&s;ed along. I was full of loathing and abhorrence again&s;t life, and every thing that life carries in its train. After wandering without any certain direction for two hours, I was overtaken by the night, and obliged to take up my re&s;t for the pre&s;ent in a &s;olitary &s;hed.</P>
<P>In a corner of the &s;hed which I had cho&s;en for my retreat I found &s;ome clean &s;traw. I threw off my rags, placing them in a &s;ituation where they would be&s;t be dried, and buried my&s;elf amid&s;t this friendly warmth. Through fatigue of mind and body it happened in this in&s;tance, though in general my repo&s;e was remarkably &s;hort, that I &s;lept till almo&s;t noon of the next day. When I ro&s;e, I found that I was at no great di&s;tance from the ferry, which I cro&s;&s;ed, and entered the town where I intended to have re&s;ted the preceding night.</P>
<P>It was market day. As I pa&s;&s;ed near the cro&s;s, I ob&s;erved two people look at me with great ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, after which one of them exclaimed, I will be damned, if I do not think that is the very fellow tho&s;e men were enquiring for, who &s;et off an hour ago by the coach for&mdash;. I was ex|tremely alarmed at this information; and, quicken|ing my pace, turned &s;harp down a narrow lane. The moment I was out of &s;ight I ran with all the &s;peed I could exert, and did not think my&s;elf &s;afe till I was &s;everal miles di&s;tant from the place where this information had reached my ears. I have always
<PB N="134" REF="028752_0362_0FDBD8D0293D0D78">
believed that the men to whom it related were the very per&s;ons who had apprehended me on board the &s;hip in which I had embarked for Ireland, that by &s;ome accident they had met with the de&s;cription of my per&s;on as publi&s;hed on the part of Mr. Falk|land, and that from putting together the circum|&s;tances they had been led to believe that this was the very individual who had lately been in their cu&s;tody. Indeed it was a piece of infatuation in me for which I am now unable to account, that, after the various indications which had oc|curred in that affair proving to them that I was a man in very critical and peculiar circum&s;tances, I &s;hould have per&s;i&s;ted in wearing the &s;ame di&s;|gui&s;e without the &s;malle&s;t alteration. My e&s;cape in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e was eminently fortunate. If I had not lo&s;t my way in con&s;equence of the hail-&s;torm of the preceding night, or if I had not &s;o greatly over&s;lept my&s;elf this very morn|ing, I mu&s;t almo&s;t infallibly have fallen into the hands of the&s;e infernal blood-hunters.</P>
<P>The town they had cho&s;en for their next &s;tage, the name of which I had thus caught in the mar|ket-place, was the very town to which, but for this intimation, I &s;hould have immediately proceeded. As it was, I determined to take a road as wide of it as po&s;&s;ible. In the fir&s;t place to which I came, in which it was practicable to do &s;o, I bought a great coat which I drew over my beggar's weeds, and a better hat. The hat I &s;louched over my face, and covered one of my eyes with a green &s;ilk &s;hade. The handkerchief, which I had hitherto worn about my head, I now tied about the lower part of my vi&s;age, &s;o as to cover my mouth. By degrees I di&s;carded every part of my former dre&s;s, and wore for my upper garment a kind of carman's frock,
<PB N="135" REF="028752_0363_0FDBD9871BEAAEC8">
which, being of the better &s;ort, made me look like the &s;on of a reputable farmer of the lower cla&s;s. Thus equipped, I proceeded on my journey, and, after a thou&s;and alarms, precautions, and circui|tous deviations from the direct path, arrived &s;afe|ly in London.</P>

<P>HERE then was the termination of an im|men&s;e &s;eries of labours, upon which no man could have looked back without a&s;toni&s;hment, or forward without a &s;entiment bordering on de&s;pair. It was at a price which defies e&s;timation that I had pur|cha&s;ed this re&s;ting-place; whether we con&s;ider the efforts it had co&s;t me to e&s;cape from the walls of my pri&s;on, or the dangers and anxieties to which I had been a prey from that hour to the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But why do I call the point at which I was now arrived a re&s;ting place? Alas, it was diametrically the rever&s;e! It was my fir&s;t and immediate bu&s;ine&s;s to review all the projects of di&s;gui&s;e I had hitherto conceived, to derive every improvement I could in|vent from the practice to which I had been &s;ub|jected, and to manufacture a veil of concealment more impenetrable than ever. This was an effort to which I could &s;ee no end. In ordinary ca&s;es the hue and cry after a &s;uppo&s;ed offender is a mat|ter of temporary operation; but ordinary ca&s;es formed no &s;tandard for the colo&s;&s;al intelligence of Mr. Falkland. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, London, which appears an inexhau&s;tible re&s;ervoir of con|cealment to the majority of mankind, brought no &s;uch con&s;olatory &s;entiment to my mind. Whether life were worth my accepting on &s;uch terms I can|not pronounce. I only know that I per&s;i&s;ted in this exertion of my faculties, through a &s;ort of pa|rental love that men are accu&s;tomed to entertain
<PB N="137" REF="028752_0365_0FDBD98D48D300B0">
for their intellectual offspring; the more thought I had expended in rearing it to its pre&s;ent perfec|tion, the le&s;s did I find my&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to abandon it. Another motive not le&s;s &s;trenuou&s;ly exciting me to per&s;everance, was the ever-growing repug|nance I felt to inju&s;tice and arbitrary power.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t evening of my arrival in town I &s;lept at an ob&s;cure inn at the borough of Southwark, choo&s;ing that &s;ide of the metropolis on account of its lying entirely wide of the part of England from which I came. I entered the inn in the evening in my countryman's frock; and, having paid for my lodging before I went to bed, equipped my&s;elf next morning as differently as my wardrobe would al|low, and left the hou&s;e before day. The frock I made up into a &s;mall packet; and, having carried it to a di&s;tance as great as I thought nece&s;&s;ary, I dropped it in the corner of an alley through which I pa&s;&s;ed. My next care was to furni&s;h my&s;elf with another &s;uit of apparel totally different from any to which I had hitherto had recour&s;e. The exterior which I was now induced to a&s;&s;ume was that of a Jew. One of the gang of thieves upon&mdash;fo|re&s;t had been of that race; and, by the talent of mimicry, which I have already &s;tated my&s;elf to po&s;&s;e&s;s, I could copy their pronunciation of the Engli&s;h language, &s;ufficiently to an&s;wer &s;uch occa|&s;ions as were likely to pre&s;ent them&s;elves. One of the preliminaries I adopted was to repair to a quar|ter of the town in which great numbers of this people re&s;ide, and &s;tudy their complexion and countenance. Having made &s;uch provi&s;ion as my prudence &s;ugge&s;ted to me, I retired for that night to an inn on the &s;ide of Mile End and Wapping. Here I accoutred my&s;elf in my new habiliments; and, having employed the &s;ame precautions as before, retired from my lodging at a time lea&s;t expo&s;ed to
<PB N="138" REF="028752_0366_0FDBD8D52EB805A0">
ob&s;ervation. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe all the particulars of my new equipage. Suffice it to &s;ay, that one of my cares was to di&s;colour my complexion, and give it the dun and sallow hue which is in mo&s;t in&s;tances characteri&s;tic of the tribe to which I a&s;&s;umed to belong; and that, when my metamorpho&s;is was fini&s;hed, I could not upon the &s;tricte&s;t examination conceive, that any one could have traced out the per&s;on of Caleb Williams in this new di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus far advanced in the execution of my pro|ject, I deemed it advi&s;able to procure a lodging, and change my late wandering life for a &s;tationary one. In this lodging I con&s;tantly &s;ecluded my&s;elf from the ri&s;ing to the &s;etting of the &s;un; the pe|riods I allowed for exerci&s;e and air were few, and tho&s;e few by night. I was even careful of &s;o much as approaching the window of my apartment, though upon the attic &s;tory; a principle I laid down to my&s;elf was, not wantonly and unnece&s;|&s;arily to expo&s;e my&s;elf to ri&s;k, however &s;light that ri&s;k might appear. Thus I had &s;eemingly attain|ed a &s;ituation of ob&s;curity, &s;ecluded from the haunts and intercour&s;e of men. It had however little re&s;emblance to that ob&s;curity to which my imagi|nation had looked forward with delight, while I was yet in&mdash;jail. There is an immea&s;urable dif|ference between that rural &s;olitude, where a man re&s;ts his head in the lap of verdure and tranquil|lity; and that retirement in the very &s;eat of action, who&s;e con&s;tant attendant is di&s;quietude, and in which a man &s;hrinks with alarm from the eye of his fellow.</P>
<P>I might have thought my&s;elf &s;till more &s;ecure, if I had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of money upon which to &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The nece&s;&s;ity of a man's earning for him|&s;elf the means of exi&s;tence is in mo&s;t in&s;tances a
<PB N="139" REF="028752_0367_0FDBD98EE5B6B578">
merely imaginary evil; but in mine certainly tended to thwart the plan of &s;ecrecy to which I was condemned. Whatever labour I adopted, or deemed my&s;elf qualified to di&s;charge, it was fir&s;t to be con&s;idered how I was to be provided with employment, and where I was to find an employer or purcha&s;er for my commodities. In the mean time I had no alternative. The little money with which I had e&s;caped from the blood-hunters was almo&s;t wholly expended.</P>
<P>After the minute&s;t con&s;ideration I was able to be&s;tow upon this que&s;tion, I determined that lite|rature &s;hould be the field of my fir&s;t experiment. I had read much of money being acquired in this way, and of prices given by the &s;peculators in this &s;ort of ware to its proper manufacturers. My qualifications I e&s;timated at a &s;lender valuation. I was not without a conviction that experience and practice mu&s;t pave the way to excellent production. But, though of the&s;e I was utterly de&s;titute, my propen&s;ities had always led me in this direction; and my early thir&s;t of knowledge had conducted me to a more intimate acquaintance with books, than could perhaps have been expected under my circum&s;tances. If my literary preten&s;ions were &s;light, the demand I intended to make upon them was not great. I only de&s;ired a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and I was per&s;uaded few per&s;ons could &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon &s;len|derer means than my&s;elf. I al&s;o con&s;idered that this was a temporary expedient, nece&s;&s;ary only till by accident or time I could place my&s;elf in a more eligible &s;ituation. The rea&s;ons that principally de|termined me in my choice, were that this employ|ment called upon me for the lea&s;t preparation, and could, as I thought, be exerci&s;ed with lea&s;t ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="028752_0368_0FDBD8D749326E60">
There was a &s;olitary woman of middle age, who tenanted a chamber in this hou&s;e upon the &s;ame floor with my own. I had no &s;ooner determined upon the de&s;tination of my indu&s;try, than I ca&s;t my eye upon her as the po&s;&s;ible in&s;trument for di&s;|po&s;ing of my productions. Excluded as I was from all intercour&s;e with my &s;pecies in general, I found plea&s;ure in the occa&s;ional exchange of a few words with this inoffen&s;ive and good-humoured creature, who was already of an age to preclude &s;candal. She lived upon a very &s;mall annuity al|lowed her by a di&s;tant relation, a woman of qua|lity, who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of thou&s;ands her&s;elf, had no other anxiety with re&s;pect to this per&s;on, than that &s;he &s;hould not contaminate her alliance by the ex|ertion of hone&s;t indu&s;try. This humble creature was of a uniformly chearful and active di&s;po&s;ition, unacquainted alike with the cares of wealth, and the pre&s;&s;ure of misfortune. Though her preten|&s;ions were &s;mall, and her information &s;lender, &s;he was by no means deficient in penetration. She &s;aw the faults and follies of mankind with a judging eye; but her temper was of &s;o mild and forgiving a ca&s;t, as would have induced mo&s;t per&s;ons to be|lieve that &s;he perceived nothing of the matter. Her heart overflowed with the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">k of kindne&s;s. She was &s;incere and ardent in her attachments, and never did &s;he omit a &s;ervice which &s;he per|ceived her&s;elf able to render to a human being. I found her willing and alert to enter into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> I propo&s;ed to her. That I might anticipate occa&s;ions of &s;u&s;picion, I frankly told her that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rea&s;ons which I wi&s;hed to be excu&s;ed from relating, but which, if related, I was &s;ure would not de|prive me of her good opinion, I found it nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ent to keep my&s;elf private. With this &s;tatement &s;he readily acquie&s;ced, and told me that
<PB N="141" REF="028752_0369_0FDBD98FFAEBA228">
&s;he had no de&s;ire for any farther information than I found it expedient to give.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t productions were of the poetical kind. After having fini&s;hed two or three, I directed this generous friend to take them to the office of a new&s;|paper; but they were rejected with contempt by the Ari&s;tarchus of that place, who, having be|&s;towed on them a &s;uperficial glance, told her that &s;uch matters were not at all in his way. I can|not help mentioning in this place that the counte|nance of Mrs. Marney (that was the name of my am|ba&s;&s;adre&s;s) was in all ca&s;es a perfect indication of her &s;ucce&s;s, and rendered explanation by words wholly unnece&s;&s;ary. She intere&s;ted her&s;elf &s;o un|re&s;ervedly in what &s;he undertook, that &s;he felt either mi&s;carriage or good fortune much more ex|qui&s;itely than I did. I had an unhe&s;itating confidence in my own re&s;ources, and, occupied as I was in the meditation of more intere&s;ting concerns, re|garded the&s;e matters as altogether trivial.</P>
<P>I quietly took the pieces back, and laid them upon my table. Upon revi&s;al I altered and tran|&s;cribed one of them, and, joining it with two others, di&s;patched them together to the editor of a magazine. He de&s;ired they might be left with him till the day after to-morrow. When that day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">me, he told my friend they &s;hould be in&s;erted; but, Mrs Marney a&s;king re&s;pecting the price, he replied, it was their con&s;tant rule to give nothing for poetical compo&s;itions, the letter-box being al|ways full of writings of that &s;ort; but, if the gentleman would try his hand in pro&s;e, a &s;hort e&s;&s;ay or a tale, he would &s;ee what he could do for him.</P>
<P>With the requi&s;ition of my literary dictated I immediately complied. I attempted a paper in the &s;tyle of Addi&s;on's Spectators, which was accepted.
<PB N="142" REF="028752_0370_0FDBD8731449F840">
In a &s;hort time I was upon an e&s;tabli&s;hed footing in this quarter. I however di&s;tru&s;ted my re&s;ources in the way of moral di&s;qui&s;ition, and &s;oon turned my thoughts to his other &s;ugge&s;tion, a tale. His demands upon me were now frequent, and to faci|litate my labour I bethought my&s;elf of the re&s;ource of tran&s;lation. I had &s;carcely any convenience with re&s;pect to the procuring of books; but, as my memory was very retentive, I frequently tran&s;|lated or modelled my narratives upon a reading of &s;ome years before. By a fatality for which I do not well know how to account, my thoughts fre|quently led me to the hi&s;tories of celebrated rob|bers; and I retailed from time to time incidents and anecdotes of Cartouche, Gu&s;man d'Alfarache, and other memorable worthies, who&s;e career was terminated upon the gallows or the &s;caffold.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE I was thus endeavouring to occupy and provide for the intermediate period till the vio|lence of the pur&s;uit after me might be a little abated, a new &s;ource of danger opened upon me of which I had no previous &s;u&s;picion. Jones, the thief who had been expelled from captain Ray|mond's gang, had fluctuated during the la&s;t years of his life, between the two profe&s;&s;ions of a vio|lator and a mini&s;ter of executive ju&s;tice. I believe he had originally devoted him&s;elf to the fir&s;t, and probably his initiation in the my&s;teries of thieving qualified him to be peculiarly expert in the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of a thief-taker, a profe&s;&s;ion he had adopted not from choice, but nece&s;&s;ity. In this employ|ment his reputation was great, though perhaps not equal to his merits; for it happens here, as in all other departments of human &s;ociety, that, however the &s;ubalterns may furni&s;h wi&s;dom and &s;kill, the principals run away with the eclat. He was exerci&s;ing this art in a very pro&s;perous man|ner, when it happened by &s;ome accident, that one or two of his atchievements, previous to his hav|ing &s;haken off the dregs of unlicen&s;ed depreda|tion, were in danger of becoming &s;ubjects of public attention. Having had repeated intima|tions of this, he thought it prudent to decamp, and it was during this period of his retreat that he entered into the&mdash;gang.</P>
<P>Such was the hi&s;tory of this man antecedently to his being placed in the &s;ituation in which I had fir&s;t encountered him. At the time of that en|counter
<PB N="144" REF="028752_0372_0FDBD8DE64A3DA30">
he was a veteran of Captain Raymond's gang; for, thieves being a &s;hort-lived race, the character of veteran co&s;ts the le&s;s time in acquir|ing. Upon his expul&s;ion from this community he returned once more to his lawful profe&s;&s;ion, and by his old comrades was received with congratu|lation as a lo&s;t &s;heep. In the vulgar cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety no length of time is &s;ufficient to expiate a crime; but among the fraternity of thief-takers it is a rule never to bring one of their own brethren to a reckoning, when it can with any propriety be avoided. Another rule ob&s;erved by tho&s;e who have pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;ame gradations as Jones had done, and which was adopted by Jones him|&s;elf, was always to re&s;erve &s;uch as had been the accomplices of their depredations to the la&s;t, and on no account to a&s;&s;ail them without great nece&s;|&s;ity or powerful temptation. For this rea&s;on Cap|tain Raymond and his confederates were, according to Jones's &s;y&s;tem of tactics, &s;afe, as he would have termed it, from his retaliation.</P>
<P>But, though Jones was in this &s;en&s;e of the term a man of &s;trict honour, my ca&s;e unfortunately did not fall within the laws of honour he acknow|ledged. Misfortune had overtaken me, and I was on all &s;ides without protection or &s;helter. The per&s;ecution to which I was expo&s;ed was founded upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of my having committed felony to an immen&s;e amount. But in this Jones had had no participation; he was carele&s;s whether the &s;uppo&s;ition were true or fal&s;e, and hated me as much as if my innocence had been e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond the reach of &s;o much as a whi&s;per of &s;u&s;|picion. The blood-hunters who had taken me into cu&s;tody at&mdash;, related, as u&s;ual, among their fraternity a part of their adventure, and told of the rea&s;on which inclined them to &s;uppo&s;e, that
<PB N="145" REF="028752_0373_0FDBD996A9E061F8">
the individual who had pa&s;&s;ed through their cu&s;tody, was the very Caleb Williams for who&s;e apprehen&s;ion a reward had been offered of a hun|dred guineas. Jones, who&s;e acutene&s;s was emi|nent in the way of his profe&s;&s;ion, by comparing facts and dates was induced to &s;u&s;pect in his own mind that Caleb Williams was the per&s;on he had hu&s;tled and wounded upon&mdash;fore&s;t. Again&s;t that per&s;on he entertained the bittere&s;t aver&s;ion. I had been the innocent occa&s;ion of his being ex|pelled with di&s;grace from Captain Raymond's gang; and Jones, as I afterwards under&s;tood, was inti|mately per&s;uaded that there was no compari&s;on between the liberal and manly profe&s;&s;ion of a rob|ber, from which I had driven him, and the &s;ordid and mechanical occupation of a blood-hunter, to which he was obliged to return. He no &s;ooner received the information I have mentioned, than he vowed revenge. He determined to leave all other objects, and con&s;ecrate every faculty of his mind to the unkenneling me from my hiding place. The offered reward, which his vanity made him con&s;ider as a&s;&s;uredly his own, appeared as the com|plete indemnification of his labour and expence. Thus I had to encounter the &s;agacity he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the way of his profe&s;&s;ion, whetted and &s;timu|lated by a &s;entiment of vengeance in a mind that knew no re&s;traint from con&s;cience or humanity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep he pur&s;ued in execution of his pro|ject, was to &s;et out for the &s;ea-port town where I had formerly been apprehended. From thence he traced me to the banks of the Severn, and from the banks of the Severn to London. It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that this is always practicable, unle&s;s the precautions of the fugitive be in the highe&s;t degree both judicious in the conception and fortunate in the execution,&mdash;provided the pur|&s;uer
<PB N="146" REF="028752_0374_0FDBD8E0F01A8788">
have motives &s;trong enough to excite him to per&s;everance. Jones indeed in the cour&s;e of his pur&s;uit was often obliged to double his &s;teps; and, like the harrier, an apt emblem of a man engaged in this &s;anguinary occupation, whenever he was at a fault, returned to the place where he had la&s;t perceived the &s;cent of the animal who&s;e death he had decreed. He &s;pared neither pains nor time in the gratification of the pa&s;&s;ion which choice had made his ruling one.</P>
<P>Upon my arrival in town he for a moment lo&s;t all trace of me, London being a place in which, on account of the magnitude of its dimen&s;ions, it might well be &s;uppo&s;ed that an individual could remain hidden and unknown. But no difficulty could di&s;courage this new adver&s;ary. He went from inn to inn, rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ing that there was no private hou&s;e to which I could immediately repair, till he found, by the de&s;cription he gave, and the &s;entiments he excited, that I had &s;lept for one night in the borough of Southwark. But he could get no farther information. The people of the inn had no knowledge what had become of me the next morning. This however did but render him more eager in his pur&s;uit. The de&s;cribing me was now more difficult, on account of the partial change of my dre&s;s I had made the &s;econd day of my being in town. But Jones at length overcame the ob&s;tacle from that quarter. Having traced me to my &s;econd inn, he was here furni&s;hed with a more copious information. I had been a &s;ubject of &s;peculation for the lei&s;ure hours of &s;ome of the per&s;ons belonging to this inn. An old woman of a mo&s;t curious and loquacious di&s;po&s;ition who lived oppo&s;ite to it, and who that morning ro&s;e early to her wa&s;hing, had e&s;pied me from her window by the light of a large lamp which hung over the
<PB N="147" REF="028752_0375_0FDBD99D3A29B5A0">
inn, as I i&s;&s;ued from the gate. She had but a very imperfect view of me, but &s;he thought there was &s;omething Jewi&s;h in my appearance. She was ac|cu&s;tomed to hold a conference every morning with the landlady of the inn, &s;ome of the waiters and chambermaids occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;i&s;ting at it. In the cour&s;e of the dialogue of this morning &s;he a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;tions about the Jew who had &s;lept there the night before. No Jew had &s;lept there. The curio&s;ity of the landlady was excited in her turn. By the time of the morning it could be no one but me. It was very &s;trange! They compared notes re&s;pecting my appearance and dre&s;s. No two things could be more di&s;&s;imilar. The Jew-Chri&s;|tian, upon any dearth of &s;ubjects of intelligence, repeatedly furni&s;hed matter for their di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The information thus afforded to Jones, appear|ed exceedingly material. But the performance did not for &s;ome time keep pace with the promi&s;e. He could not enter every private hou&s;e into which lodgers were ever admitted, in the &s;ame manner that he had treated the inns. He walked the &s;treets, and examined with a curious and inqui&s;itive eye the countenance of every Jew about my &s;tature; but in vain. He repaired to Duke's Place and the &s;ynagogues. It was not here that in reality he could calculate upon finding me; but he re&s;orted to the&s;e means in de&s;pair and as a la&s;t hope. He was more than once upon the point of giving up the pur&s;uit; but he was recalled to it by an in&s;a|tiable and re&s;tle&s;s appetite for revenge.</P>
<P>It was during this perturbed and fluctuating &s;tate of his mind that he chanced to pay a vi&s;it to a brother of his who was the head-workman of a printing-office. There was little intercour&s;e be|tween the&s;e two per&s;ons, their di&s;po&s;itions and habits of life being extremely di&s;&s;imilar. The prin|ter
<PB N="148" REF="028752_0376_0FDBD945A85DFFE8">
was indu&s;trious, &s;ober, and of a propen&s;ity to accumulation. He was extremely di&s;&s;atisfied with the character and pur&s;uits of his brother, and had made &s;ome ineffectual attempts to reclaim him. But, though they by no means agreed in their ha|bits of thinking, they &s;ometimes &s;aw each other. Jones loved to boa&s;t of as many of his atchieve|ments as he dared venture to mention; and his brother was one more hearer, in addition to the &s;et of his u&s;ual a&s;&s;ociates. The printer was amu&s;ed, with the blunt &s;agacity of remark and novelty of incident that characteri&s;ed Jones's conver&s;ation. He was &s;ecretly plea&s;ed, in &s;pite of all his &s;ober and church-going prejudices, that he was brother to a man of &s;o much ingenuity and fortitude.</P>
<P>After having li&s;tened for &s;ome time upon this occa&s;ion to the wonderful &s;tories which Jones in his rugged way conde&s;cended to tell, the printer felt an ambition to entertain his brother in his turn. He began to retail &s;ome of my &s;tories of Cartouche and Gu&s;man d'Alfarache. The attention of Jones was excited. His fir&s;t emotion was wonder; his &s;econd was envy and aver&s;ion. Where did the printer get the&s;e &s;tories? This que&s;tion was an|&s;wered. I will tell you what, &s;aid the printer, we none of us know what to make of the writer of the&s;e articles. He writes poetry and morality and hi&s;tory: I am a printer and corrector of the pre&s;s, and may pretend without vanity to be a tolerably good judge of the&s;e matters: he writes them all to my mind extremely fine, and yet he is no more than a Jew. [To my hone&s;t printer this &s;eemed as &s;trange as if they had been written by a Cherokee chieftain at the falls of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.]</P>
<P>A Jew! How do you know? Did you ever &s;ee him?</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="028752_0377_0FDBD99E661BFB40">
No; the matter is always brought to us by a woman. But my ma&s;ter hates all my&s;teries; he likes to &s;ee his auth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rs them&s;elves. So he plagues and plagues the old woman; but he can never get any thing out of her, except that one day &s;he hap|pened to drop that the young gentleman was a Jew.</P>
<P>A Jew! a young gentleman! a per&s;on who did every thing by proxy, and made a &s;ecret of all his motions! Here was abundant matter for the &s;pe|culations and &s;u&s;picions of Jones. He was con|firmed in them, without adverting to the proce&s;s of his own mind, by the &s;ubject of my lucubra|tions, men who died by the hands of the execu|tioner. He &s;aid little more to his brother, except a&s;king, as if ca&s;ually, what &s;ort of an old woman this was? of what age &s;he might be? and whe|ther &s;he often brought him materials of this kind? and &s;oon after took occa&s;ion to leave him.</P>
<P>It was with va&s;t plea&s;ure that Jones had li&s;tened to this unhoped for information. Having col|lected from his brother &s;ufficient hints relative to the per&s;on and appearance of Mrs. Marney, and under&s;tanding that he expected to receive &s;ome|thing from me the next day, Jones took his &s;tand in the &s;treet early that he might not ri&s;k mi&s;carri|age by negligence. He waited &s;everal hours, but not without &s;ucce&s;s. Mrs. Marney came; he watched her into the hou&s;e; and after about twenty minutes delay &s;aw her return. He dogged her from &s;treet to &s;treet; ob&s;erved her finally enter the door of a private hou&s;e; and congratulated him&s;elf upon having at length arrived at the con|&s;ummation of his labours.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e &s;he entered was not her own habita|tion. By a &s;ort of miraculous accident &s;he had
<PB N="150" REF="028752_0378_0FDBD9A3AE24B2C8">
ob&s;erved Jones following her in the &s;treet. As &s;he went home, &s;he &s;aw a woman who had fallen down in a fainting fit. Moved by the compa&s;&s;ion that was ever alive in her, &s;he approached her in order to render her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Pre&s;ently a crowd collected round them. Mrs. Marney having done what &s;he was able, once more proceeded home|wards. Ob&s;erving the crowd round her, the idea of pickpockets occurred to her mind; &s;he put her hands to her &s;ides, and at the &s;ame time looked round upon the populace. She had left the circle &s;omewhat abruptly; and Jones, who had been obliged to come nearer le&s;t he &s;hould lo&s;e her in the confu&s;ion, was at that moment &s;tanding exactly oppo&s;ite to her. His vi&s;age was of the mo&s;t ex|traordinary kind; habit had written the characters of malignant cunning and dauntle&s;s effrontery in every line of his face; and Mrs. Marney, who was neither philo&s;opher nor phy&s;iognomi&s;t, was never|thele&s;s &s;truck. This good woman, like mo&s;t per|&s;ons of her notable character, had a peculiar way of going home, not through the open &s;treets, but by narrow lanes and alleys, with intricate in|&s;ertions and &s;udden turnings. In one of the&s;e by &s;ome accident &s;he once again caught a glance of her pur&s;uer. This circum&s;tance, together with the &s;ingularity of his appearance, awakened her conjectures. Could he be following her? It was the middle of the day, and &s;he could have no fears for her&s;elf. But could this circum&s;tance have any reference to me? She recollected the precau|tions and &s;ecrecy I practi&s;ed, and had no doubt that I had rea&s;ons for what I did. She recol|lected that &s;he had always been upon her guard re&s;pecting me; but had &s;he been &s;ufficiently &s;o? She thought that, if &s;he &s;hould be the means of
<PB N="151" REF="028752_0379_0FDBDB154B1EF838">
any mi&s;chief to me, &s;he &s;hould be mi&s;erable for ever. She determined therefore by way of pre|caution in ca&s;e of the wor&s;t, to call at a friend's hou&s;e, and &s;end me word of what had occurred. Having in&s;tructed her friend, &s;he went out imme|diately upon a vi&s;it to a per&s;on in the exactly op|po&s;ite direction, and de&s;ired her friend to proceed upon the errand to me, five minutes after &s;he left the hou&s;e. By this prude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;he completely ex|tricated me from the pre&s;ent danger.</P>
<P>Meantime the intelligence that was brought me by no means a&s;certained the greatne&s;s of the dan|ger. For any thing I could di&s;cover in it, the cir|cum&s;tance might be perfectly innocent, and the fear &s;olely proceed from the over caution and kind|ne&s;s of this benevolent and excellent woman. Yet &s;uch was the mi&s;ery of my &s;ituation, that I had no choice. For this menace or no menace, I was obliged to de&s;ert my habitation at a minute's warn|ing, taking with me nothing but what I could carry in my hand; to &s;ee my generous benefactre&s;s no more; to quit my little arrangements and provi|&s;ion; and to &s;eek once again in &s;ome forlorn re|treat new projects and, if of that I could have any rational hope, a new friend: I de&s;cended into the &s;treet with a heavy, not an irre&s;olute heart. It was broad day. I &s;aid, Per&s;ons are at this mo|ment &s;uppo&s;ed to be roaming the &s;treet in &s;earch of me: I mu&s;t not tru&s;t to the chance of their pur&s;uing one direction, and I another. I tra|ver&s;ed half a dozen &s;treets, and then dropped into an ob&s;cure hou&s;e of entertainment for per&s;ons of &s;mall expence. In this hou&s;e I took &s;ome refre&s;h|ment, pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal hours of active, but melan|choly thinking, and at la&s;t procured a bed. As &s;oon however as it was dark, I went out (for this

was indi&s;pen&s;able) to purcha&s;e the materials of a new di&s;gui&s;e. Having adju&s;ted it as well as I could during the night, I left this a&s;ylum with the &s;ame precautions that I had employed in former in&s;tances.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>I PROCURED a new lodging. I became more cautious, and went out &s;eldomer than ever. By &s;ome bias of the mind it may be, gratifying it&s;elf with images of peril, I inclined upon the whole to believe that Mrs. Marney's alarm had not been without foundation. I was however unable to conjecture through what means danger had ap|proached me; and had therefore only the un&s;atis|factory remedy of redoubling my watch upon all my actions. Still I had the joint con&s;iderations pre&s;&s;ing upon me of &s;ecurity and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. I had &s;ome &s;mall remains of the produce of my former indu&s;try; but this was but &s;mall, for my employer was in arrear with me, and I did not choo&s;e in any method to apply to him for payment. The anxieties of my mind in &s;pite of all my &s;truggles preyed upon my heath. I did not con|&s;ider my&s;elf as in &s;afety for an in&s;tant. My ap|pearance was wa&s;ted to a &s;hadow; and I &s;tarted at every &s;ound that was unexpected. Sometimes I was half tempted to re&s;ign my&s;elf into the hands of the law, and brave its wor&s;t; but re&s;entment and indignation at tho&s;e times &s;peedily flowed back upon my mind, and re-animated my per&s;everance.</P>
<P>I knew no better re&s;ource with re&s;pect to &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, than that I had employed in the former in&s;tance, of &s;eeking &s;ome third per&s;on to &s;tand between me and the di&s;po&s;al of my indu&s;try. I might find an individual ready to undertake this office in my behalf, but where &s;hould I find the
<PB N="154" REF="028752_0382_0FDBD9ABCF4FA5B0">
benevolent &s;oul of Mrs. Marney? The per&s;on I fixed upon was a Mr. Spurrel, a man who took in work from the watch-makers, and had an apart|ment upon our &s;econd floor. I examined him two or three times with irre&s;olute glances, as we pa&s;&s;ed upon the &s;tairs, before I would venture to acco&s;t him. He ob&s;erved this, and at length kindly in|vited me into his apartment.</P>
<P>Being &s;eated, he condoled with me upon my &s;eeming bad health, and the &s;olitary mode of my living, and wi&s;hed to know whether he could be of any &s;ervice to me. From the fir&s;t moment he &s;aw me, he had conceived an affection for me. In my pre&s;ent di&s;gui&s;e I appeared twi&s;ted and de|formed, and in other re&s;pects by no means an ob|ject of attraction. But it &s;eemed, Mr. Spurrel had lo&s;t an only &s;on about &s;ix months before, and I was the very picture of him. If I had put off my counterfeited ugline&s;s, I &s;hould probably have l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t all hold upon his affections. He was now an old man, as he ob&s;erved, ju&s;t dropping into the grave, and this &s;on had been his only con&s;olation. The poor lad was always ailing, but he had been a nur&s;e to him; and the more care he required while he was alive, the more he mi&s;&s;ed him now he was dead. Now he had not a friend, nor any body that cared for him in the whole world. If I plea&s;ed, I &s;hould be in&s;tead of that &s;on to him, and he would treat me in all re&s;pects with the &s;ame at|tention and care.</P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;en&s;e of the&s;e benevolent offers; but told him that I &s;hould be &s;orry to be in any way burthen&s;ome to him. My ideas at pre&s;ent led me to a private and &s;olitary life, and my chief dif|ficulty was to reconcile this with &s;ome mode of earning nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. If he would con|de&s;cend to lend me his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;moothing this
<PB N="155" REF="028752_0383_0FDBDB1B6690E8D8">
difficulty, it would be the greate&s;t benefit he could confer on me. I told him that my mind had al|ways had a mechanical and indu&s;trious turn, and that I did not doubt of &s;oon ma&s;tering any craft to which I &s;eriou&s;ly applied my&s;elf. I had not been brought up to any trade; but, if he would favour me with his in&s;tructions, I would work with him as long as he plea&s;ed for a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. I knew that I was a&s;king of him an extraordinary kindne&s;s, but I was urged on the one hand by ex|treme and unmitigable nece&s;&s;ity, and encouraged on the other by the per&s;ua&s;ivene&s;s of his friendly pro|fe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The old man dropped &s;ome tears over my appa|rent di&s;tre&s;s, and readily con&s;ented to every thing I propo&s;ed. Our agreement was &s;oon made, and I entered upon my functions accordingly. My new friend was a man of a &s;ingular turn of mind. Love of money and a charitable officiou&s;ne&s;s of demea|nour were his leading characteri&s;tics. He lived in the mo&s;t penurious manner, and denied him&s;elf almo&s;t every indulgence. I entitled my&s;elf almo&s;t immediately, as he frankly acknowledged, to &s;ome remuneration for my labours, and accordingly he in&s;i&s;ted upon my being paid. He did not however, as &s;ome per&s;ons would have done under the cir|cum&s;tances I have de&s;cribed, pay me the whole amount of my earnings, but profe&s;&s;ed to &s;ubtract from them twenty per cent. as an equitable con&s;i|deration for in&s;truction and commi&s;&s;ion-money in procuring me a channel for my indu&s;try. Yet he frequently &s;hed tears over me, was unea&s;y in every moment of our indi&s;pen&s;able &s;eparation, and exhi|bited perpetual tokens of attachment and fond|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I had not been long in this new &s;ituation, be|fore an incident occurred which filled me with
<PB N="156" REF="028752_0384_0FDBD9AD2DA21D18">
greater alarm and apprehen&s;ion than ever. I was walking out one evening for an hour's exerci&s;e and air, an indulgence in which I now &s;carcely ever allowed my&s;elf, when my ear was &s;truck with two or three ca&s;ual &s;ounds from the mouth of a hawker who was bawling his wares. I &s;tood &s;till to inform my&s;elf more exactly, when to my utter a&s;toni&s;h|ment and confu&s;ion I heard him deliver him&s;elf nearly in the&s;e words. "Here you have the Mo&s;t Wonderful and Surpri&s;ing Hi&s;tory, and Miraculous Adventures of Caleb Williams! you are informed how he fir&s;t robbed, and then brought fal&s;e accu|&s;ations again&s;t his ma&s;ter; as al&s;o of his attempt|ing divers times to break out of pri&s;on, till at la&s;t he effected his e&s;cape in the mo&s;t wonderful and uncredible manner; as al&s;o of his travelling the kingdom in various di&s;gui&s;es, and the robberies he committed with a mo&s;t de&s;perate and daring gang of thieves; and of his coming up to London, where it is &s;uppo&s;ed he now lies concealed; with a true and faithful copy of the hue and cry printed and publi&s;hed by one of his maje&s;ty's mo&s;t princi|pal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, offering a reward of one hundred guineas for apprehending him. All for the price of one halfpenny."</P>
<P>Petrified as I was at the&s;e amazing and dread|ful &s;ounds, I had the temerity to go up to the man and purcha&s;e one of his papers, de&s;perately re&s;olv|ed to know the exact &s;tate of the fact, and what I had to depend upon. I carried it with me a little way, till, no longer able to endure my impa|tience, I contrived to make out the chief part of its contents by the help of a lamp, at the upper end of a narrow pa&s;&s;age. I found it contain a greater number of circum&s;tances than could have been ex|pected in this &s;pecies of publication. I was equal|led to the mo&s;t notorious hou&s;e-breaker in the art
<PB N="157" REF="028752_0385_0FDBDB1CA85C5620">
of penetrating through walls and doors, and to the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed &s;windler in plau&s;iblene&s;s, dupli|city and di&s;gui&s;e. The hand-bill which Wil&s;on had fir&s;t brought to us upon the fore&s;t, was printed at length. All my di&s;gui&s;es, previou&s;ly to the la&s;t alarm that had been given me by the providence of Mrs. Marney, were faithfully enumerated; and the public was warned to be upon their watch again&s;t a per&s;on of an uncouth and extraordinary appear|ance, and who lived in a reclu&s;e and &s;olitary manner. I al&s;o learned from this paper that my former lodgings had been &s;earched on the very even|ing of my e&s;cape, and that Mrs. Marney had been &s;ent to Newgate upon a charge of mi&s;pri&s;ion of felony.&mdash;This la&s;t circum&s;tance affected me deeply. It was a mo&s;t cruel and intolerable idea, if I were not only my&s;elf to be an object of unrelenting per&s;ecution, but my very touch were to be infec|tious, and every one that &s;uccoured me to be involv|ed in the common ruin. I could almo&s;t have con|&s;ented to undergo the utmo&s;t malice of my ene|mies, could I by that means have &s;aved this excel|lent woman from an hour's di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;I afterwards learned that Mrs. Marney was delivered from con|finement by the interpo&s;ition of her noble rela|tion.</P>
<P>This paper was the con&s;ummation of my misfor|tune. Nothing could happen beyond it but the actual apprehen&s;ion with which I was menaced. Di&s;gui&s;e was no longer of u&s;e to me. A nume|rous cla&s;s of individuals, through every depart|ment, almo&s;t every hou&s;e of the metropolis, would be induced to look with a &s;u&s;picious eye upon eve|ry &s;tranger, e&s;pecially every &s;olitary &s;tranger, that fell under their ob&s;ervation. The prize of one hundred guineas was held out to excite their cu|pidity, and &s;harpen their penetration. It was no longer Bow-Street, it was a million of men, in
<PB N="158" REF="028752_0386_0FDBD9B32BE3CB48">
arms again&s;t me. Neither had I the refuge, which few men have been &s;o mi&s;erable as to want, of one &s;ingle individual with whom to repo&s;e my alarms, and who might &s;helter me from the gaze of indi&s;|criminate curio&s;ity. I in&s;tantly &s;aw that London was no place for my abode, at the &s;ame time that I apprehended increa&s;e of peril in any attempt to withdraw from it. I re&s;olved however that I would no longer &s;ubmit to this &s;tate of terrific alarm. I re&s;olved that I would not remain quie&s;cent, till mi&s;|chief &s;hould overtake and devour me. I could &s;carcely reduce things to a more mi&s;erable pa&s;s. "To be wor&s;e than this, were not to be at all."</P>
<P>Filled with reflections of this nature, I careful|ly and deliberately de&s;troyed the paper I had been reading, by tearing it in a thou&s;and pieces. I did not return home, but went in&s;tantly to the water|&s;ide. I found that the cheape&s;t pa&s;&s;age I could procure was in a ve&s;&s;el, moored near the Tower, and which was to &s;ail in a few days for Middleburg in Holland. I would have gone in&s;tantly on board and endeavoured to prevail with the captain to let me remain there till he &s;ailed; but that unfortu|nately I had not money enough in my pocket to defray my pa&s;&s;age. It was wor&s;e than this. I had not money enough in the world. I however paid the captain half his demand, and promi&s;ed to re|turn with the re&s;t. I knew not in what manner it was to be procured, but I believed that I would not fail to procure it. I had &s;ome idea of borrow|ing it of Mr. Spurrel. Surely he would not re|fu&s;e me? He appeared to love me with parental affection, and I thought I might tru&s;t my&s;elf for a moment in his hands.</P>
<P>I approached my own home with a heavy and foreboding heart. Mr. Spurrel was not at home; and I was obliged to wait for his return. I had
<PB N="159" REF="028752_0387_0FDBDB1E28D9FA30">
work of his in my trunk, which had been deliver|ed out to me that very morning, to five times the amount I wanted. I even canva&s;&s;ed for a moment whether I &s;hould make u&s;e of this pro|perty as if it were my own; but I rejected the idea with di&s;dain. I had never in the &s;malle&s;t degree merited the reproaches that were ca&s;t upon me; and I was determined I never would merit them. It was extraordinary that Mr. Spurrel &s;hould be abroad at this hour; I had never known it happen before. His bed-time was between nine and ten. Ten o'clock came, eleven o'clock, but not Mr. Spurrel. At midnight I heard his knock at the door. Every &s;oul in the hou&s;e was in bed. Mr. Spurrel, on account of his regular hours, was un|provided with a key to open for him&s;elf. A gleam of gaiety and the &s;ocial &s;pirit came over my heart. I flew nimbly down the &s;tairs, and opened the door to him my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I could perceive by the little taper in my hand &s;omething extraordinary written in his counte|nance. I had not time to &s;peak, before I &s;aw two other men follow him. At the fir&s;t glance I was &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured what &s;ort of per&s;ons they were. At the &s;econd I perceived that one of them was no other than Jones him&s;elf. I had under&s;tood formerly that he had been of this profe&s;&s;ion, and I was not much &s;urpri&s;ed to find him in it again. Though I had for &s;ome hours made up my mind as it were, to the unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity of my once more falling into the hands of the officers of law, yet I could not &s;ee them enter without feeling my very heart ache in my bo&s;om. I was be&s;ide not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the time and manner of their en|trance, and de&s;irous to learn whether Mr. Spurrel could be ba&s;e enough to have been their intro|ducer.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="028752_0388_0FDBD9B32E51A2B0">
I was not long held in perplexity. He no &s;ooner &s;aw his two followers properly within the door, than he exclaimed with convul&s;ive eagerne&s;s, There, there, that is your man! thank God! thank God! Jones looked eagerly in my face, with a counte|nance expre&s;&s;ive alternately of hope and doubt, and an&s;wered, By G&mdash;, and I do not know whether it be or no! I am afraid we are in the wrong box! then recollecting him&s;elf, We will go into the hou&s;e, and examine farther however. We all went up &s;tairs in|to Mr. Spurrel's room; I &s;et down the candle upon the table. I had hitherto been &s;ilent; but now, with a calm and deliberate manner, in my feigned voice, one of the characteri&s;tics of which was li&s;ping, I a&s;ked, And pray, gentlemen, what may be your plea&s;ure with me? Why, &s;aid Jones, our errand is with one Caleb Williams, and a precious ra&s;cal he is! I ought to know the chap well enough; but they &s;ay he has as many faces as there are days in the year. So you plea&s;e to pull off your face; or if you cannot do that, at lea&s;t you can put off your clothes, and let us &s;ee what your hump is made of.</P>
<P>I remon&s;trated, but in vain. I &s;tood detected in part of my artifice; and Jones, though &s;till un|certain, was every moment more and more con|firmed in his &s;u&s;picions. Mr. Spurrel perfectly gloted, with eyes that &s;eemed ready to devour eve|ry thing that pa&s;&s;ed. As my impo&s;ture gradually appeared more palpable, he repeated his exclama|tion, Thank God! thank God! At la&s;t, tired with this &s;cene of mummery, and di&s;gu&s;ted beyond mea&s;ure with the ba&s;e and hypocritical figure I &s;eemed to exhibit, I exclaimed, Well, I am Caleb Williams; conduct me wherever you plea&s;e! And now, Mr. Spurrel&mdash;! He gave a violent &s;tart. The in&s;tant I declared my&s;elf his tran&s;port had
<PB N="161" REF="028752_0389_0FDBDB23D4846930">
been at the highe&s;t, and was, to any power he was able to exert, ab&s;olutely uncontroulable. But the unexpectedne&s;s of my addre&s;s, and the tone in which I &s;poke, electrified him.&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible, continued I, that you &s;hould have been the wretch to betray me? What had I done to de&s;erve this treatment? Is this the kindne&s;s you profe&s;&s;ed? the affection that was perpetually in your mouth? to be the death of me!</P>
<P>My poor boy! my dear creature! cried Spurrel, whimpering, and in a tone of the humble&s;t expo&s;|tulation, indeed I could not help it! I would have helped it, if I could! I hope they will not hurt my darling! I am &s;ure, I &s;hall die if they do!</P>
<P>Mi&s;erable driveller! interrupted I, with a &s;tern voice, do you betray me into the gore-dripping fangs of the law, and then talk of my not being hurt? I know my &s;entence, and am prepared to meet it! You have fixed the halter upon my neck, and at the &s;ame price would have done &s;o to your only &s;on! Go, count your accur&s;ed guineas! My life would have been &s;afer in the hands of one I had never &s;een, than in yours, who&s;e mouth and who&s;e eyes for ever ran over with crocodile affec|tion!</P>

<P>SAYING this, I left him with ineffable con|tempt, unable to utter a word. Jones and his com|panion attended me. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to repeat all the in&s;olence of this man. He alternately tri|umphed in the completion of his revenge, and re|gretted the lo&s;s of the reward to the &s;hrivelled old curmudgeon we had ju&s;t quitted, whom however he &s;wore he would cheat of it, if he could. He equally regretted the imperfect way in which his &s;kill had been cut off; boa&s;tfully recounting how he had ferreted me thus far, and bitterly lamenting that the whole had not been left to him, which in a day or two he would infallibly have accom|pli&s;hed.</P>
<P>I paid but little attention to his &s;tory. It &s;truck upon my &s;en&s;e, and I was able to recollect it at my neare&s;t lei&s;ure, though I thought not of it at the time. For the pre&s;ent I was bu&s;ily employed reflecting on my new &s;ituation, and the conduct to be ob&s;erved in it. My pro&s;pects were particu|larly gloomy and di&s;couraging. How much labour had I exerted, fir&s;t to extricate my&s;elf from pri&s;on, and next to evade the diligence of my pur&s;uers; and the re&s;ult of all, after months of anxiety and diligence, was, to be brought back to the point from which I began! I had gained fame indeed, the mi&s;erable fame to have my &s;tory bawled forth by hawkers and ballad-mongers, to have my prai&s;es as an active and &s;urpri&s;ing villain celebrated among
<PB N="163" REF="028752_0391_0FDBDB266DBAF860">
footmen and chambermaids; but I was neither an Ero&s;tratus nor an Alexander, to die contented with that &s;pecies of eulogium. With re&s;pect to all that was &s;olid and de&s;irable, what chance could I a&s;cribe to new exertions of a &s;imilar nature; which, if undertaken at all, mu&s;t be undertaken with infi|nitely more unfavourable au&s;pices?</P>
<P>They were con&s;iderations like the&s;e that dictated my re&s;olution. My mind had been gradually weaning from Mr. Falkland, till its feelings ro&s;e to &s;omething like abhorrence. I had long cheri&s;hed a reverence for him, which not even animo&s;ity and per&s;ecution on his part could readily de&s;troy. But I now a&s;cribed a character &s;o inhumanly &s;anguinary to his mind; I &s;aw &s;omething &s;o fiend-like in the thus hunting me round the world, and determining to be &s;atisfied with nothing le&s;s than my blood, while at the &s;ame time he knew my innocence, my innoxiou&s;ne&s;s, nay I might add my virtues; that henceforth I trampled reverence and the recollec|tion of former e&s;teem under my feet. I lo&s;t all regard to his intellectual greatne&s;s, and all pity for the torture and agonies of his &s;oul. I al&s;o would abjure forbearance. I would &s;how my&s;elf bitter and inflexible as he had done. Was it wi&s;e in him to compel me into extremity and madne&s;s? Had he no fears for his own &s;ecret and atrocious of|fences?</P>
<P>I went before the magi&s;trates to who&s;e office Jones and his comrade conducted me, fully deter|mined to publi&s;h tho&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ecrets, of which I had hitherto been the faithful depo&s;itory; and once for all to turn the tables upon my accu&s;er. It was time that the real criminal &s;hould be the &s;uf|ferer, and not that innocence &s;hould for ever labour under the oppre&s;&s;ion of guilt. I had been obliged to &s;pend the remainder of the night upon which I
<PB N="164" REF="028752_0392_0FDBDAD760F52628">
had been apprehended in pri&s;on. During the in|terval I had thrown off every ve&s;tige of di&s;gui&s;e, and appeared the next morning in my own per&s;on. I was of cour&s;e ea&s;ily identified; and, this being the whole with which the magi&s;trates before whom I now &s;tood thought them&s;elves concerned, they were proceeding to make out an order for my being conducted back to my own county. I &s;u&s;pended the di&s;patch of this mea&s;ure by ob&s;erving that I had &s;omething to di&s;clo&s;e. This is an overture to which men appointed for the admini&s;tration of cri|minal ju&s;tice never fail to attend.</P>
<P>I &s;aid that I had always prote&s;ted my innocence, and mu&s;t now repeat the prote&s;t.</P>
<P>In that ca&s;e, retorted the &s;enior magi&s;trate ab|ruptly, what can you have to di&s;clo&s;e? If you are innocent, that is no bu&s;ine&s;s of ours! We act officially.</P>
<P>I always declared, continued I, that I was the perpetrator of no guilt, but that the guilt wholly belonged to my accu&s;er. He privately conveyed the&s;e effects among my property, and then charged me with the robbery. I now declare more than that, that this man is a MURDERER, that I de|tected his criminality, and that for that rea&s;on he is determined to deprive me of life. I pre&s;ume, gentlemen, that you do con&s;ider it as your bu&s;ine&s;s to take this declaration. I am per&s;uaded you will be by no means di&s;po&s;ed actively or pa&s;&s;ively to contribute to the atrocious inju&s;tice under which I &s;uffer, to the impri&s;onment and condemnation of an innocent man in order that a murderer may go free. I &s;uppre&s;&s;ed this &s;tory as long as I could. I was extremely aver&s;e to be the author of the un|happine&s;s or the death of a human being. But all patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion have their limits.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="028752_0393_0FDBDB27EF0E6EB8">
Give me leave, &s;ir, rejoined the magi&s;trate with an air of affected moderation, to a&s;k you two que&s;|tions. Were you any way aiding, abetting, or contributing to this murder?</P>
<P>No.</P>
<P>And pray, &s;ir, who is this Mr. Falkland, and what may have been the nature of your connection with him?</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland is a gentleman of &s;ix thou&s;and per annum. I lived with him as his &s;ecretary.</P>
<P>In other words you were his &s;ervant?</P>
<P>As you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Very well, &s;ir, that is quite enough for me. Fir&s;t I have to tell you as a magi&s;trate, that I can have nothing to do with your declaration. If you had been concerned in the murder you talk of, that would alter the ca&s;e. But it is out of all rea&s;ona|ble rule for a magt&s;trate to take an information from a felon, except again&s;t his accomplices. Next I think it right to ob&s;erve to you in my own pro|per per&s;on, that you appear to me to be the mo&s;t impudent ra&s;cal I ever &s;aw. Why, are you &s;uch an a&s;s as to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;ort of &s;tory you have been telling, can be of any &s;ervice to you, either here, or at the a&s;&s;izes, or any where el&s;e? A fine time of it indeed it would be, if, when gentle|men of &s;ix thou&s;and a year take up their &s;ervants for robbing them, tho&s;e &s;ervants could trump up &s;uch accu&s;ations as the&s;e, and could get any ma|gi&s;trate or court of ju&s;tice to li&s;ten to them! Whe|ther or no the felony with which you &s;tand charged would have brought you to the gallows, I will not pretend to &s;ay. But I am &s;ure this &s;tory will. There would be a &s;peedy end to all order and good government, if fellows that trample upon ranks and di&s;tinctions in this atrocious &s;ort, were upon any con&s;ideration &s;uffered to get off.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="028752_0394_0FDBDAD9F0943BC8">
And do you refu&s;e, &s;ir, to attend to the particu|lars of the charge I alledge?</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ir, I do.&mdash;But, if I did not, pray what witne&s;&s;es have you of the murder?</P>
<P>This que&s;tion &s;taggered me.</P>
<P>None.&mdash;But I believe I can make out a circum|&s;tantial proof of a nature to force attention from the mo&s;t indifferent hearer.</P>
<P>I thought &s;o.&mdash;Officers, take him from the bar.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ucce&s;s of this ultimate re&s;ort on my part, upon which I had built with &s;uch un|doubting confidence. Till now I had conceived that the unfavourable &s;ituation in which I was placed was prolonged by my own forbearance; and I was determined to endure all that human na|ture could &s;upport, rather than have recour&s;e to this extreme recrimination. That idea &s;ecretly con|&s;oled me under all my calamities: a voluntary &s;a|crifice is chearfully made. I regarded my&s;elf as allied to the army of martyrs and confe&s;&s;ors; I applauded my own fortitude and &s;elf-denial; and I plea&s;ed my&s;elf with the idea, that I had the power, though I hoped never to employ it, by an unrelenting di&s;play of all my re&s;ources to put an end at once to my &s;ufferings and per&s;ecutions.</P>
<P>And this at la&s;t was the ju&s;tice of mankind. A man under certain circum&s;tances &s;hall not be heard in the detection of a crime, becau&s;e he has not been a participator of it! The &s;tory of a flagitious mur|der &s;hall be li&s;tened to with indifference, while an innocent man is hunted like a wild bea&s;t to the far|the&s;t corners of the earth! Six thou&s;and a year &s;hall protect a man from accu&s;ation; and the va|lidity of an impeachment &s;hall be &s;uper&s;eded, be|cau&s;e the author of it is a &s;ervant!</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="028752_0395_0FDBDB2E0C754CF0">
I was conducted back to the very pri&s;on from which a few months before I had made my e&s;cape. My pro&s;pects were more gloomy, and my &s;ituation apparently more irremediable than ever. I was ex|po&s;ed again, if that were of any account, to the in&s;olence and tyranny that are uniformly exerci&s;ed within tho&s;e walls. Why &s;hould I repeat the loath|&s;ome tale of all that was endured by me, and is en|dured by every man who is unhappy enough to fall under the government of the&s;e con&s;ecrated mini&s;ters of national juri&s;prudence? The &s;ufferings I had already experienced, my anxieties, my flight, the perpetual expectation of being di&s;covered, wor&s;e than the di&s;covery it&s;elf, would perhaps have been enough to &s;atisfy the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible individual in the court of his own con&s;cience, if I had even been the felon I was pretended to be. But the law has neither eyes, nor ears, nor bowels of humanity; and it turns into marble the hearts of all tho&s;e that are nur&s;ed in its principles.</P>
<P>Yet I was not ca&s;t down. I re&s;olved that, while I had life, I would never de&s;pair. Op|pre&s;&s;ed, annihilated I might be; but if I died, I would die re&s;i&s;ting. What u&s;e, what advantage, what plea&s;urable &s;entiment could ari&s;e from a tame &s;urrender? There is no man that is ignorant, that to humble your&s;elf at the feet of the law is a bootle&s;s ta&s;k; in her courts there is no room for amendment and reformation.</P>
<P>My fortitude may to &s;ome per&s;ons appear above the &s;tandard of human nature. But, if I draw back the veil from my heart, they will readily con|fe&s;s their mi&s;take. My heart bled at every pore. My re&s;olution was not the calm &s;entiment of phi|lo&s;ophy and rea&s;on. It was a gloomy and de&s;perate purpo&s;e; the creature, not of hope, but of a mind au&s;terely held to its de&s;ign, that thought it&s;elf &s;a|tisfied
<PB N="168" REF="028752_0396_0FDBDADBD7961600">
with the naked effort, and prepared to give &s;ucce&s;s or mi&s;carriage to the winds. It was to this mi&s;erable condition, which might awaken &s;ympa|thy in the mo&s;t hardened bo&s;om, that Mr. Falk|land had reduced me.</P>
<P>I anticipated the event of my trial. I was deter|mined once more to e&s;cape from my pri&s;on, nor did I doubt of my ability to effect at lea&s;t this fir&s;t &s;tep towards my future pre&s;ervation. The a&s;&s;izes, how|ever, were near, and there were certain con&s;idera|tions, unnece&s;&s;ary to be detailed, that per&s;uaded me there might be benefit in waiting till my trial &s;hould actually be terminated, before I made my attempt. It &s;tood upon the li&s;t as one of the late&s;t to be brought forward. I was therefore extremely &s;urpri&s;ed to find it called out of its order early on the morning of the &s;econd day. But, if this were unexpected, how much greater was my a&s;toni&s;h|ment, when my pro&s;ecutor was called, to find nei|ther Mr. Falkland nor Mr. Fore&s;ter, nor a &s;ingle individual of any de&s;cription appear again&s;t me! The recognizances into which my pro&s;ecutors had entered were ordered to be forfeited, and I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without further impediment from the bar.</P>
<P>The effect which this incredible rever&s;e produced upon my mind was as if I had fallen from the ele|vation of the mo&s;t di&s;tant planet in the &s;y&s;tem upon our earth in a moment. I, who had come to that bar with the &s;entence of death already in idea ring|ing in my ears, to be told that I was free to tran|&s;port my&s;elf whither&s;oever I plea&s;ed! Was it for this that I had broken through &s;o many locks, and bolts, and the adamantine walls of my pri&s;on; that I had pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many anxious days, and &s;leeple&s;s, &s;pectre|haunted nights; that I had racked my invention for expedients of eva&s;ion and concealment; that
<PB N="169" REF="028752_0397_0FDBDB32979E14E0">
my mind had been rou&s;ed to an energy of which I could &s;carcely have believed it capable; that my exi&s;tence had been enthralled to an ever-living tor|ment &s;uch as I could hardly have &s;uppo&s;ed it in man to endure? Great God! what is man? Is he thus blind to the future, thus totally un&s;u&s;pecting of what is to occur in the next moment of his ex|i&s;tence? I have &s;omewhere read that heaven in mercy hides from us the future incidents of our life. My own experience does not well accord with this a&s;&s;ertion. In this in&s;tance at lea&s;t I &s;hould have been &s;aved from in&s;upportable labour and unde|&s;cribable angui&s;h, could I have fore&s;een the cata&s;|trophe of this mo&s;t intere&s;ting tran&s;action.</P>

<P>IT was not long before I took my everla&s;ting leave of this dete&s;ted and mi&s;erable &s;cene. My heart was for the pre&s;ent too full of a&s;toni&s;hment and exulta|tion in this unexpected deliverance, to admit of anxi|ety about the future. I withdrew from the town. I rambled with a &s;low and thoughtful pace, now bur&s;ting with exclamation, and now buried in pro|found and undefinable reverie. Accident led me towards the very heath which had fir&s;t &s;heltered me, when upon a former occa&s;ion I broke out of my pri&s;on. I wandered among its cavities and its vallies. It was a forlorn and de&s;olate &s;olitude. I continued here I know not how long. Night at length overtook me unperceived, and I prepared to return for the pre&s;ent to the town I had quitted.</P>
<P>It was now perfectly dark, when two men whom I had not previou&s;ly ob&s;erved &s;prung upon me from behind. They &s;eized me by the arms, and threw me upon the ground. I had no time for re|&s;i&s;tance or recollection. I could however perceive that one of them was the diabolical Jones. They blindfolded, gagged me, and hurried me I knew not whither. As we pa&s;&s;ed along in &s;ilence, I en|deavoured to conjecture what could be the meaning of this extraordinary violence. I was &s;trongly im|pre&s;&s;ed with the idea that, after the event of this morning, the mo&s;t &s;evere and painful part of my hi&s;tory was pa&s;t; nor could I per&s;uade my&s;elf to &s;hrink with alarm at this unexpected attack. It
<PB N="171" REF="028752_0399_0FDBDB341A6942D0">
might however be &s;ome new project &s;ugge&s;ted by the brutal unrelenting temper and animo&s;ity of Jones.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ently found that we were returned into the town I had ju&s;t quitted. They led me into a hou&s;e, and, as &s;oon as they had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a room, freed me from the re&s;traints they had before im|po&s;ed. Here Jones informed me with a malicious grin, that no harm was intended me, and there|fore I &s;hould &s;how mo&s;t &s;en&s;e in keeping my&s;elf quiet. I perceived that we were in an inn; I over|heard company in a room at no great di&s;tance from us, and therefore was my&s;elf as thoroughly aware as he could be, that there was at pre&s;ent little rea|&s;on to &s;tand in fear of any &s;pecies of violence, and that it would be time enough to re&s;i&s;t, when they attempted to conduct me from the inn in the &s;ame manner that they had brought me into it. I was not without &s;ome curio&s;ity to &s;ee the conclu&s;ion that was to follow upon &s;o extraordinary a commence|ment.</P>
<P>The preliminaries I have de&s;cribed were &s;carcely completed, before Mr. Falkland entered the room. I remember Collins, when he fir&s;t communicated to me the particulars of our patron's hi&s;tory, ob&s;erved that he was totally unlike the man he had once been. I had no means of a&s;certaining the truth of that ob&s;ervation. But it was &s;trikingly applicable to the &s;pectacle which now pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my eyes, though, when I la&s;t beheld this unhappy man, he had been a victim to the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, a prey to the &s;ame undying remor&s;e as now. Mi&s;ery was at that time in&s;cribed in legible characters upon his countenance. But now he appeared like nothing that had ever been vi&s;ible in human &s;hape. His vi&s;age was haggard, emaciated, and fle&s;hle&s;s. His complexion was a dun and tarni&s;hed red, the co|lour uniform through every region of the face, and
<PB N="172" REF="028752_0400_0FDBDAE2782C7A58">
&s;ugge&s;ted the idea of its being burnt and parched by the eternal fire that burned within him. His eyes were red, quick, wandering, full of &s;u&s;picion and rage. His hair was neglected, ragged, and float|ing. His whole figure was thin to a degree that &s;ugge&s;ted the idea rather of a &s;keleton than a per|&s;on actually alive. Life &s;eemed hardly to be the capable inhabitant of &s;o woe-begone and gho&s;t-like a figure. The taper of whole&s;ome life was ex|pired; but pa&s;&s;ion and fiercene&s;s and frenzy were able for the pre&s;ent to &s;upply its place.</P>
<P>I was to the utmo&s;t degree a&s;toni&s;hed and &s;hocked at the &s;ight of him.&mdash;He &s;ternly commanded my conductors to leave the room</P>
<P>Well, &s;ir, I have this day &s;ucce&s;sfully exerted my&s;elf to &s;ave your life from the gallows. A fort|night ago you did what you were able to bring my life to that ignominious clo&s;e.</P>
<P>Were you &s;o &s;tupid and undi&s;tingui&s;hing as not to know that the pre&s;ervation of your life was the uniform object of my exertions? Did not I main|tain you in pri&s;on? Did not I endeavour to prevent your being &s;ent thither? Could you mi&s;take the bigoted and ob&s;tinate conduct of Fore&s;ter in offer|ing a hundred guineas for your apprehen&s;ion for mine?</P>
<P>I had my eye-upon you in all your wanderings. You have taken no material &s;tep through their whole cour&s;e with which I have not been acquaint|ed. I meditated to do you good. I have &s;pilled no blood but that of Tyrrell: that was in the mo|ment of pa&s;&s;ion, and it has been the &s;ubject of my uninterrupted and hourly remor&s;e. I have con|nived at no man's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate but that of the Hawkinses: they could no otherwi&s;e have been &s;aved than by acknowledging my&s;elf a murderer. The re&s;t of my life has all been &s;pent in acts of benevolence. I
<PB N="173" REF="028752_0401_0FDBDB38EF7E7E38">
meditated to do you good. For that rea&s;on I was willing to prove you. You pretended to act towards me with con&s;ideration and forbearance. If you had per&s;i&s;ted in that to the end, I would yet have found a way to reward you I left you to your own di&s;cretion. You might &s;how the impo|tent malignity of your own heart, but in the cir|cum&s;tances in which you were then placed I knew you could not hurt me. Your forbearance has proved, as I all along &s;u&s;pected, empty and treach|erous. You have attempted to bla&s;t my reputation. You have &s;ought to di&s;clo&s;e the &s;elect and eternal &s;ecret of my &s;oul. Becau&s;e you have done that, I will never forgive you. I will remember it to my late&s;t breath. The memory &s;hall &s;urvive me, when my exi&s;tence is no more. Do you think you are out of the reach of my power, becau&s;e a court of ju&s;tice has acquitted you?</P>
<P>While Mr. Falkland was &s;peaking, a &s;udden di&s;|temper came over his countenance, his whole frame was &s;haken by an in&s;tantaneous convul&s;ion, and he &s;taggered to a chair. In about three minutes he re|covered.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;aid he, I am &s;till alive. I &s;hall live for days and months and years; the power that made me, of whatever kind it be, can only determine how long. I live the guardian of my reputation. That, and to endure a mi&s;ery &s;uch as man never endured, are the only ends to which I live. But, when I am no more, my fame &s;hall &s;till &s;urvive. My character &s;hall be revered, as &s;potle&s;s and un|impeachable by all po&s;terity, as long as the name of Falkland &s;hall be repeated in the mo&s;t di&s;tant region of the many-peopled globe.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he retu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ned to the di&s;cour&s;e which more immediately related to my future con|dition and happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="028752_0402_0FDBDAE5EB6490F8">
There is one condition, &s;aid he, upon which you may obtain &s;ome mitigation of your future ca|lamity. It is for that purpo&s;e that I have &s;ent for you. Li&s;ten to my propo&s;als with deliberation and &s;obriety! Remember, that the in&s;anity is not le&s;s to trifle with the re&s;olved determination of my &s;oul, than it would be to pull a mountain upon your head that hung trembling upon the edge of the mighty Appenine!</P>
<P>I in&s;i&s;t then upon your &s;igning a paper declaring in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner that I am innocent of murder, and that the charge you alleged at the of|fice in Bow-&s;treet is fal&s;e, malicious and ground|le&s;s. Perhaps you may &s;cruple out of a regard to truth. Is truth then entitled to adoration for its own &s;ake, and not for the &s;ake of the happine&s;s it is calculated to produce? Will a rea&s;onable man &s;acrifice to barren truth, when benevolence, huma|nity and every con&s;ideration that is dear to the hu|man heart require that it &s;hould be &s;uper&s;eded! It is probable that I may never make u&s;e of this pa|per, but I require it as the only practicable repara|tion to the honour you have a&s;&s;ailed. This is what I had to propo&s;e. I expect your an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Sir, an&s;wered I, I have heard you to an end, and I &s;tand in need of no deliberation to enable me to an&s;wer you in the negative. You took me up a raw and inexperienced boy, capable of being moulded to any form you plea&s;ed. But you have communicated to me volumes of experience in a very &s;hort period. I am no longer irre&s;olute and pliable. What is the power you retain over my fate I am unable to di&s;cover. You may de&s;troy me; but you cannot make me tremble. I am not concerned to enquire whether what I have &s;uffered flowed from you by de&s;ign or otherwi&s;e, whether you were the author of my mi&s;eries or only con|nived
<PB N="175" REF="028752_0403_0FDBDB3CE7FD4630">
at them. This I know, that I have &s;uffered too exqui&s;itely on your account, for me to feel the lea&s;t remaining claim on your part to my making any voluntary &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>You &s;ay that benevolence and humanity require this &s;acrifice of me. No. It would only be a &s;a|crifice to your mad and mi&s;guided love of fame, to that pa&s;&s;ion which has been the &s;ource of all your mi&s;eries, of the mo&s;t tragical calamities to others, and of every misfortune that has hap|pened to me. I have no forbearance to exerci&s;e towards that pa&s;&s;ion. If you be not yet cured of this tremendous and &s;anguinary folly, at lea&s;t I will do nothing to cheri&s;h it. I know not whether from my youth I was de&s;tined for a hero; but I may thank you for having taught me a le&s;&s;on of in&s;urmountable fortitude.</P>
<P>What is it that you require of me? That I &s;hould &s;ign away my own reputation for the better maintaining of yours. Where is the equality of that? What is it that ca&s;ts me at &s;uch an immen&s;e di&s;tance below you, as to make every thing that relates to me wholly unworthy of con&s;ideration? You have been educated in the prejudice of birth. I abhor that prejudice. You have made me de&s;|perate, and I utter what that de&s;peration &s;ugge&s;ts.</P>
<P>You will tell me perhaps that I have no repu|tation to lo&s;e, that, while you are e&s;teemed fault|le&s;s and unblemi&s;hed, I am univer&s;ally reputed a thief, a &s;uborner and a calumniator. Be it &s;o. I will never do any thing to countenance tho&s;e im|putations. The more I am de&s;titute of the e&s;teem of mankind, the more careful I will be to pre&s;erve my own. I will never from fear or any other mi&s;taken motive do any thing of which I ought to be a&s;hamed.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="028752_0404_0FDBDAEEEB8B3398">
You are determined to be for ever my enemy. I have in no degree de&s;erved this eternal abhor|rence. I have always e&s;teemed and pitied you. For a con&s;iderable time I rather cho&s;e to expo&s;e my&s;elf to every kind of misfortune, than di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecret that was &s;o dear to you. I was not de|terred by your menaces, (What could you make me &s;uffer more than I actually &s;uffered?) but by the humanity of my own heart; in which, and not in means of violence, you ought to have re|po&s;ed your confidence. What is the my&s;terious vengeance that you can yet execute again&s;t me? You menaced me before; you can menace no wor&s;e now. You are wearing out the &s;prings of terror. Do with me as you plea&s;e! You teach me to hear you with an un&s;hrinking and de&s;perate firmne&s;s. Recollect your&s;elf! I did not proceed to the act with which you reproach me till I was apparently urged to the very la&s;t extremity. I am now &s;orry that that &s;tep was ever adopted. But it &s;eemed that I was treated with unrelenting rigour; and, urged to exa&s;peration by unintermitted &s;uffer|ings, I had no time to cool or to deliberate. Even at pre&s;ent I cheri&s;h no vengeance again&s;t you. All that is rea&s;onable, all that can really contribute to your &s;ecurity, I will readily concede; but I will not be driven to an act repugnant to all rea&s;on, integrity, and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland li&s;tened to me with a&s;toni&s;hment and impatience. He had entertained no previous conception of the firmne&s;s I di&s;played. Several times he was convul&s;ed with the fury that laboured in his brea&s;t. Once and again he betrayed an in|tention to interrupt; but he was re&s;trained by the collectedne&s;s of my manner, and perhaps by a de|&s;ire to be acquainted with the entire &s;tate of my mind. Finding that I had concluded, he pau&s;ed
<PB N="177" REF="028752_0405_0FDBDB3E719D08D8">
for a moment; his pa&s;&s;ion &s;eemed gradually to en|large, till it was no longer capable of controul.</P>
<P>It is well! &s;aid he, gna&s;hing his teeth, and &s;tamping upon the ground. You refu&s;e the com|po&s;ition I offer! I have no power to per&s;uade you to compliance! You defy me! At lea&s;t I have a power re&s;pecting you, and that power I will exer|ci&s;e; a power that &s;hall grind you into atoms. I conde&s;cend to no more expo&s;tulation. I know what I am, and what I can be. I know what you are, and what fate is re&s;erved for you!</P>
<P>Saying this he quitted the room.</P>
<P>Such were the particulars of this memorable &s;cene. The impre&s;&s;ion it has left upon my under|&s;tanding is indelible. The figure and appearance of Mr. Falkland, his death-like weakne&s;s and de|cay, his more than mortal energy and rage, the words that he &s;poke, the motives that animated him, produced one compounded effect upon my mind that nothing of the &s;ame nature could ever parallel. The idea of his mi&s;ery thrilled through my frame. How weak in compari&s;on of it is the imaginary hell, which the great enemy of man|kind is repre&s;ented as carrying every where about with him!</P>
<P>From this con&s;ideration my mind pre&s;ently turned to the menaces he had vented again&s;t my|&s;elf. They were all my&s;terious and undefined. He had talked of power, but had given no hint from which I could collect in what he imagined it to con&s;i&s;t. He had talked of mi&s;ery, but had not dropped a &s;yllable re&s;pecting the nature of the mi|&s;ery to be inflicted.</P>
<P>I &s;at &s;till for &s;ome time ruminating on the&s;e thoughts. Neither Mr. Falkland, nor any other per&s;on appeared, to di&s;turb my meditations. I ro&s;e, went out of the room, and from the inn
<PB N="178" REF="028752_0406_0FDBDAF1197113A8">
into the &s;treet. No one offered to mole&s;t me. It was &s;trange! What was the nature of this power from which I was to apprehend &s;o much, yet which &s;eemed to leave me at perfect liberty? I began to imagine that all I had heard from this dreadful adver&s;ary was mere madne&s;s and extra|vagance, that he was at length deprived of the u&s;e of rea&s;on, which had long &s;erved him only as a medium of torment. Yet was it likely in that ca&s;e that he &s;hould be able to employ Jones and his a&s;&s;ociate, who had ju&s;t been his in&s;truments of violence upon my per&s;on?</P>
<P>I proceeded along the &s;treets with con&s;iderable caution. I looked before me and behind me, as well as the darkne&s;s would allow me to do, that I might not again be hunted in &s;ight by &s;ome man of &s;tratagem and violence without my perceiving it. I was not as before beyond the limits of the town, but con&s;idered the &s;treets, the hou&s;es and the in|habitants as affording &s;ome degree of &s;ecurity. I was &s;till walking with my mind thus full of &s;u&s;|picion and foreca&s;t, when I di&s;covered Thomas, that &s;ervant of Mr. Falkland whom I have already more than once had occa&s;ion to mention. He advanced towards me with an air &s;o blunt and di|rect, as in&s;tantly to remove from me the idea of any thing in&s;idious in his purpo&s;e; be&s;ide that I had always felt the character of Thomas, ru&s;tic and uncultivated as it was, to be entitled to a more than common proportion of e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Thomas, &s;aid I, as he advanced, I hope you are willing to give me joy that I am at length delivered from the dreadful danger which for many months haunted me &s;o unmercifully.</P>
<P>No, rejoined Thomas roughly, I be not at all willing. I do not know what to make of my|&s;elf
<PB N="179" REF="028752_0407_0FDBDB40212ED7B0">
in this affair. While you were in pri&s;on in that mi&s;erable fa&s;hion, I felt all at one almo&s;t as if I loved you: and, now that that is over, and you are turned out loo&s;e in the world to do your wor&s;t, my blood ri&s;es at the very &s;ight of you. To look at you, you are almo&s;t that very lad Williams for whom I could with plea&s;ure as it were have laid down my life; and yet behind that &s;miling face there lie robbery&punc; and lying, and eve|ry thing that is ungrateful and murderous Your la&s;t action was wor&s;e than all the re&s;t How could you find in your heart to revive that cruel &s;tory about Mr. Tyrrel, which every body had agreed out of regard to the &s;quire never to mention again, and of which I know and you know he is as innocent as the child unborn? There are cau&s;es and rea&s;ons, or el&s;e I could have wi&s;hed from the bottom of my &s;oul never to have &s;et eyes on you again!</P>
<P>And you &s;till per&s;i&s;t in your hard thoughts of me!</P>
<P>Wor&s;e! I think wor&s;e of you than ever! Be|fore, I thought you as bad as man could be. I wonder from my &s;oul what you are to do next. But you make good the old &s;aying, When a man is once in&mdash;.</P>
<P>And &s;o there is never to be an end of my mis|fortunes. What can Mr. Falkland contrive for me wor&s;e than the ill opinion and enmity of all man|kind?</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland contrive! He is the be&s;t friend you have in the world, though you are the ba&s;e&s;t trai|tor to him. Poor man! it makes one's heart ache to look at him; he is the very image of grief. And it is not clear to me that it is not all owing to you. At lea&s;t you have given the fini&s;hing blow in behalf of the di&s;ea&s;ethat already had him in its clutches. There have been the devil and all to pay
<PB N="180" REF="028752_0408_0FDBDAF65373CC20">
between him and &s;quire Fore&s;ter. The &s;quire is right raving mad with my ma&s;ter, for having out|witted him in the matter of the trial, and &s;aved your life. He &s;wears that you &s;hall be taken up and tried all over again at the next a&s;&s;izes; but my ma&s;ter is &s;o re&s;olute, that I believe he will carry it his own way. To &s;ee him ordering every thing for your benefit, and taking all your maliciou&s;ne&s;s as mild and innocent as a lamb, and then to think of your vile proceedings again&s;t him, is a &s;ight one &s;hall not &s;ee again, if one was to go all the world over. For God's &s;ake, repent of your reprobate doings, and make what little reparation is in your power! Think of your poor &s;oul, before you awake, as to be &s;ure one of the&s;e days you will, in fire and brim&s;tone everla&s;ting!</P>
<P>Saying this, he held out his hand, and took hold of mine. The action &s;eemed &s;trange, but I at fir&s;t thought of it as the unpremeditated re&s;ult of his &s;olemn and well-intended adjuration. I felt however that he put &s;omething into my hand. The next moment he quitted his hold, and ha&s;tened from me with the &s;wiftne&s;s of an arrow. What he had thus given me was a bank-note of twenty pounds. I had no doubt that he had been charged to deliver it to me from Mr. Falkland.</P>
<P>What was I to infer? What light did it throw upon the intentions of my inexorable per&s;ecutor? His animo&s;ity again&s;t me was as great as ever; that I had ju&s;t had confirmed to me from his own mouth. Yet his animo&s;ity appeared to be &s;till tempered with the remains of humanity. He pre&s;cribed to it a line wide enough to embrace the gratifica|tion of his views, and within the boundaries of that line it &s;topped. But this di&s;covery carried no con&s;olation to my mind. I knew not what portion of calamity I was fated to endure, before his jealou&s;y
<PB N="181" REF="028752_0409_0FDBDB46AFA4A3D8">
of di&s;honour and inordinate thir&s;t of fame would deem them&s;elves &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Another que&s;tion offered it&s;elf. Was I to receive the money which had ju&s;t been put into my hands? the money of a man, who had inflicted upon me injuries, le&s;s than tho&s;e which he had entailed up|on him&s;elf, but the greate&s;t that one man can in|flict upon another? who had bla&s;ted my youth, who had de&s;troyed my peace, who had held me up to the abhorrence of mankind, and rendered me an outca&s;t upon the face of the earth? who had forged of me the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t atrocious fal&s;e&s;hoods, and urged them with a &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and per&s;eve|rance which produced univer&s;al belief? who an hour before had vowed again&s;t me inexorable en|mity, and &s;worn to entail upon me mi&s;ery without end? Would not this conduct on my part betray a ba&s;e and abject &s;pirit, that crouched under tyran|ny, and ki&s;&s;ed the hands that were embrued in my blood?</P>
<P>If the&s;e rea&s;ons appeared &s;trong, neither was the other &s;ide without rea&s;ons in reply. I wanted the money: not for any purpo&s;e of vice or &s;uper|fluity, but for tho&s;e purpo&s;es without which life cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Man ought to be able, wherever placed, to find for him&s;elf the means of exi&s;tence: but I was to open a new &s;cene of life, to remove to &s;ome di&s;tant &s;pot, to be prepared again&s;t the ill|will of mankind, and the unexplored projects of ho&s;tility of a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed foe. The actual means of exi&s;tence are the property of all. What &s;hould hinder me from taking that of which I was really in want, when in taking it I ri&s;ked no ven|geance and perpetrated no violence? The property in que&s;tion will be beneficial to me, and the volun|tary &s;urrender of it is accompanied with no injury to its late proprietor; what other condition can be

nece&s;&s;ary to render the u&s;e of it on my part a duty? He that lately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it has injured me; does that alter its value as a medium of exchange? He will boa&s;t perhaps of the imaginary obligation he has conferred on me: Surely to &s;hrink from a thing in it&s;elf right, from any &s;uch apprehen&s;ion, can be the re&s;ult only of pu&s;illanimity and cowar|dice.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<P>INFLUENCED by the&s;e rea&s;onings, I determin|ed to retain what had thus been put into my hands. My next care was in regard to the &s;cene I &s;hould choo&s;e as the retreat of that life which I had ju&s;t &s;aved from the gra&s;p of the executioner. The danger to which I was expo&s;ed of forcible interrup|tion in my pur&s;uits was probably in &s;ome re&s;pects le&s;s now, than it had been previou&s;ly to this cri&s;is. Be&s;ide, that I was con&s;iderably influenced in this deliberation by the &s;trong loathing I conceived for the &s;ituations in which I had lately been engaged. I knew not in what mode Mr. Falkland intended to exerci&s;e his vengeance again&s;t me; but I was &s;eized with &s;o unconquerable an aver&s;ion to di&s;gui&s;e and the idea of &s;pending my life in the per&s;onating a fictitious character, that I could not for the pre&s;ent at lea&s;t reconcile my mind to any thing of that na|ture. The &s;ame kind of di&s;gu&s;t I had conceived for the metropolis, where I had &s;pent &s;o many hours of artifice and terror. I therefore decided in favour of the project which had formerly prov|ed amu&s;ing to my imagination, of withdrawing to &s;ome di&s;tant, rural &s;cene, a &s;cene of calmne&s;s and ob&s;curity, where for a few years at lea&s;t, perhaps during the life of Mr. Falkland, I might be hidden from the world, recover the wounds my mind had received in this fatal connexion, metho|di&s;e and improve the experience which had been accumulated, cultivate the faculties I in any degree po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and employ the intervals of the&s;e occu|pations
<PB N="184" REF="028752_0412_0FDBDAFF422D28D0">
in &s;imple indu&s;try and the intercour&s;e of guilele&s;s, uneducated, kind-intentioned minds. The menaces of my per&s;ecutor &s;eemed to forebode the inevitable interruption of this &s;y&s;tem. But I deem|ed it wi&s;e to put the&s;e menaces out of my con&s;i|deration. I compared them to death, which mu&s;t infallibly overtake us, we know not when; but the po&s;&s;ibility of who&s;e arrival next year, next week, to-morrow, mu&s;t be left out of the calculation of him who would enter upon any important or well|concerted undertaking.</P>
<P>Such were the ideas that determined my choice. Thus did my youthful mind delineate the &s;y&s;tem of di&s;tant years, even when the threats of in&s;tant calamity &s;till &s;ounded in my ears. I was inured to the apprehen&s;ion of mi&s;chief, till at la&s;t the hoar&s;e roarings of the beginning tempe&s;t had no power to di&s;turb my tranquillity. I however thought it nece&s;&s;ary, while I was apparently with|in the &s;phere of the enemy, to exert every practi|cable degree of vigilance. I was careful not to in|cur the hazards of darkne&s;s and &s;olitude. When I left the town, it was with the &s;tage-coach, an obvious &s;ource of protection again&s;t glaring and enormous violence. Meanwhile I found my&s;elf no more expo&s;ed to mole&s;tation in my progre&s;s, than the man in the world who &s;hould have had the lea&s;t rea&s;on for apprehen&s;ions of this nature. As the di&s;tance increa&s;ed, I relaxed &s;omething in my precaution, though &s;till awake to a &s;en&s;e of danger, and con&s;tantly pur&s;ued with the image of my foe. I fixed upon an ob&s;cure market-town in Wales as the cho&s;en &s;eat of my operations. This place re|commended it&s;elf to my ob&s;ervation, as I was wan|dering in que&s;t of an abode. It was clean, chear|ful, and of great &s;implicity of appearance. It was at a di&s;tance from any public and frequented road,
<PB N="185" REF="028752_0413_0FDBDB4830C81538">
and had nothing which could de&s;erve the name of trade. The face of nature around it was agree|ably diver&s;ified, being partly wild and romantic, and partly rich and abundant in production.</P>
<P>Here I &s;olicited employment in two profe&s;&s;ions; the fir&s;t that of a watch-maker, in which though the in&s;tructions I had received were but few, they were eked out and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a mind fruitful in mechanical invention; the other that of an in|&s;tructor in mathematics and its practical applica|tion, geography, a&s;tronomy, land-&s;urveying and navigation. Neither of the&s;e was a very copious &s;ource of emolument in the ob&s;cure retreat I had cho&s;en for my&s;elf: but, if my receipts were &s;lender, my di&s;bur&s;ements were &s;till fewer. In this little town I became acquainted with the vicar, the apo|thecary, the lawyer, and the re&s;t of the per&s;ons who time out of mind had been regarded as the top gentry of the place. Each of the&s;e centred in him&s;elf a variety of occupations. There was little in the appearance of the vicar that reminded you of his profe&s;&s;ion except on the recurring Sunday. At other times he conde&s;cended with his evange|lical hand to guide the plough, or to drive the cows from the field to the farm-yard for the milk|ing. The apothecary occa&s;ionally officiated as a barber, and the lawyer was the village &s;chool|ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>By all the&s;e per&s;ons I was received with kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality. Among people thus remote from the bu&s;tle of human life there is an open &s;pirit of confidence, by means of which, a &s;tranger ea&s;ily finds acce&s;s to their benevolence and good-will. My manners had never been greatly debauched, by the &s;cenes through which I had pa&s;&s;ed, from the &s;implicity of rural life; and the hard&s;hips I had endured gave additional mildne&s;s to my character.
<PB N="186" REF="028752_0414_0FDBDB0268CAC790">
In the theatre upon which I was now placed I had no rival. My mechanical occupation had hitherto been a non-re&s;ident; and the &s;choolma&s;ter, who did not a&s;pire to the &s;ublime heights of &s;cience I profe&s;&s;ed to di&s;cover, was very willing to admit me as a partner in the ta&s;k of civilizing the unpoli&s;hed manners of the inhabitants. For the par&s;on, civi|li&s;ation was no part of his trade; his bu&s;ine&s;s was with the things of a better life, not with the carnal concerns of this material &s;cene; in truth, his thoughts were principally occupied with his oat|meal and his cows.</P>
<P>This &s;cene had perhaps a more powerful handle upon my affections, than it would have had upon tho&s;e of almo&s;t any other per&s;on with my degree of intellectual cultivation. I had had a profound experience, though a &s;hort one, of &s;ociety &s;uch as ranks and regulations have con&s;tituted it. The &s;imple &s;cene of which I was now an inmate, the abode of gro&s;s and un&s;u&s;pecting ignorance, bore a kind of rude re&s;emblance to that &s;implicity which &s;eems to be the goal of elevated and comprehen&s;ive rea&s;on. I bore with its gro&s;&s;ne&s;s, the narrowne&s;s of its pro&s;pects and the uniformity of its impre&s;|&s;ions, in behalf of its freedom from malignity and deceit. How long I &s;hould have &s;at down contented with the&s;e defects in con&s;ideration of the&s;e advantages I am unable to pronounce. For the pre&s;ent, &s;ore with per&s;ecution and di&s;tre&s;s, and bleeding at almo&s;t every vein, there was nothing I &s;o much coveted as re&s;t and tranquillity. It &s;eemed as if my faculties were, at lea&s;t for the time, exhau&s;ted by the late preternatural and vice-derived inten&s;ity of their ex|ertions, and that they &s;tood indi&s;pen&s;ably in need of a period of comparative &s;u&s;pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate, &s;o grateful to my feelings, week after week glided away without interruption and alarm. Every day contributed to my progre&s;s in
<PB N="187" REF="028752_0415_0FDBDB4D86A61E30">
the e&s;teem of my guilele&s;s neighbours. At fir&s;t they looked upon me with wonder as a &s;ort of non de&s;cript; but they were plea&s;ed to find upon farther acquaintance that I fell in for the mo&s;t part with their habits and manners; and that, though I was able, if &s;olicited, to inform them upon &s;ub|jects extremely remote from their u&s;ual occupa|tions, yet my &s;uperior knowledge gave me no in|clination to dictate or domineer. The peculiari|ties in which I differed from them generated no aver&s;ion. My habits were more &s;olitary and &s;eden|tary than tho&s;e of any of my neighbours: but I &s;tate the &s;imple and unornamented fact when I affirm, that my univer&s;al character among them was that of a per&s;on of great learning and know|ledge, mild, even-tempered, and that would not hurt &s;o much as a worm.</P>
<P>Thus tranquil, there were moments in which I even forgot there was &s;uch a per&s;on as Mr. Falk|land in the world. The &s;ituation in which I was now placed was not very different from that in which I had &s;pent my earlier years; and I began to look back upon the intervening period as upon a di&s;tempered and tormenting dream; or rather per|haps my feelings were like tho&s;e of a man reco|vered from &s;ix months raging delirium, from ideas of horror, confu&s;ion, &s;light, per&s;ecution, agony and de&s;pair! When I recollected what I had un|dergone, it was not without &s;ome &s;atisfaction as the recollection of a thing that was pa&s;t; every day augmented my hope that it was never to re|turn. Surely the dark and terrific menaces of Mr. Falkland were rather the perturbed &s;ugge&s;tions of his angry mind, than the final re&s;ult of a delibe|rate and dige&s;ted &s;y&s;tem! How happy &s;hould I feel beyond what ordinarily falls to the lot of man, if, after the terrors and alarms I had undergone, I
<PB N="188" REF="028752_0416_0FDBDB074CFBFD68">
found my&s;elf thus unexpectedly re&s;tored to the im|munities of a human being!</P>
<P>While I was thus &s;oothing my mind with fond imaginations, it happened that a few bricklayers and their labourers came over from a di&s;tance of five or &s;ix miles, to work upon &s;ome additions to one of the better &s;ort of hou&s;es in the town which had changed its tenant. No incident could be more trivial than this, had it not been for a &s;trange coincidence of time between this circum&s;tance and a change which introduced it&s;elf into my &s;ituation. This fir&s;t manife&s;ted it&s;elf in a &s;ort of &s;hyne&s;s with which I was treated fir&s;t by one per&s;on and then another of my new-formed acquaintance. They were backward to enter into conver&s;ation with me, and an&s;wered my enquiries with an aukward and embarra&s;&s;ed air. When they met me in the &s;treet or the field, their countenance contracted a cloud, and they endeavoured to &s;hun me. My &s;cholars quitted me one after another, and I had no longer any employment in my mechanical profe&s;&s;ion. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the &s;en&s;ations which the gradual, but uninterrupted progre&s;s of this revolu|tion produced in my mind. It &s;eemed as if I had &s;ome contagious di&s;ea&s;e, from which every man &s;hrunk with alarm, and left me to peri&s;h una&s;&s;i&s;ted and alone. I a&s;ked one man and another to ex|plain to me the meaning of the&s;e appearances; but every one avoided the ta&s;k, and an&s;wered in an eva&s;ive and ambiguous manner. I &s;ometimes &s;up|po&s;ed that it was all a delu&s;ion of the imagination; till the repetition of the &s;en&s;ation, and &s;till more the decay of my projected modes of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, brought the reality too painfully home to my ap|prehen&s;ion. There are few things that give a greater &s;hock to the mind than a phenomenon in the conduct of our fellow men, of great import|ance
<PB N="189" REF="028752_0417_0FDBDB4FAB836B68">
to our concerns, and for which we are un|able to a&s;&s;ign any plau&s;ible rea&s;on. I was like a tree &s;truck with &s;ome fatal blight, from which one branch falls off after another, and leaves the naked trunk a monument of calamity and &s;corn. Inca|pable of a&s;&s;igning the cau&s;e of my di&s;grace, I was at times half inclined to believe that the change was not in other men, but that &s;ome alienation of my own under&s;tanding generated the horrid vi&s;ion. I endeavoured to awake from my dream, and re|turn to my former &s;tate of enjoyment and happi|ne&s;s; but in vain. To the &s;ame con&s;ideration it may be a&s;cribed, that unacquainted with the &s;ource of the evil, ob&s;erving its perpetual increa&s;e, and finding it &s;o far as I could perceive entirely arbi|trary in its nature, I was unable to a&s;certain its limits, or the degree in which it would finally overwhelm me.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t however of the wonderful and &s;eem|ingly inexplicable nature of this &s;cene, there was one idea that in&s;tantly intruded it&s;elf, and that I could never after bani&s;h from my mind. It is Falkland! In vain I &s;truggled again&s;t the &s;eeming improbability of the &s;uppo&s;ition. In vain I &s;aid, Mr. Falkland, wi&s;e as he is and pregnant in re|&s;ources, acts by human and not by &s;upernatural means. He may overtake me by &s;urpri&s;e and in a manner of which I have no previous expectation; but he cannot produce a great and notorious effect without &s;ome vi&s;ible agency, however difficult it may be to trace that agency, to its ab&s;olute author. He cannot, like tho&s;e invi&s;ible per&s;onages who are &s;uppo&s;ed from time to time to interfere in human affairs, ride in the whirlwind, &s;hroud him&s;elf in clouds and impenetrable darkne&s;s, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> de|&s;truction upon the earth from his &s;ecret habitation. Thus it was that I bribed my imagination, and en|deavoured to per&s;uade my&s;elf that my pre&s;ent un|happine&s;s
<PB N="190" REF="028752_0418_0FDBDB092CB54060">
originated in a different &s;ource from my former. All evils appeared trivial to me, in com|pari&s;on of the recollection and perpetuation of my parent misfortune. I was little better than di&s;tracted between the incoherence of my ideas as to my pre|&s;ent &s;ituation excluding from it the machinations of Mr. Falkland, and the horror I conceived at the bare po&s;&s;ibility of again encountering his animo&s;ity, after a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of many weeks, a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion as I had hoped for ever. An interval of weeks was an age to a per&s;on in the calamitous &s;ituation I had &s;o long experienced. But, in &s;pite of all my efforts, I could not bani&s;h from my mind the dreadful idea. My original conceptions of the genius and the per|&s;everance of Mr. Falkland had been &s;uch, that I could with difficulty think that any thing was im|po&s;&s;ible to him. I knew not how to &s;et up my own opinions of material cau&s;es and the powers of the human mind as the limits of exi&s;tence. Mr. Falk|land had always been to my imagination an object of wonder, and that which excites our wonder we &s;carcely ever &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves competent to ana|ly&s;e.</P>
<P>I was in this &s;tate of mind, and had already been compelled by the &s;ituation of my affairs to meditate the removing my&s;elf to a different re&s;idence, when a new circum&s;tance occurred, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tended in part to di&s;&s;ipate the mi&s;t which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> over my under|&s;tanding. In reality, nothing at this time appeared more nece&s;&s;ary to me than information. Without &s;ome conception of the cau&s;e of my pre&s;ent mis|fortune I could not tell whither to remove, nor what precautions my intere&s;t obliged me to adopt. I was &s;aved by the incident to which I allude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the nece&s;&s;ity of proceeding entirely at random.</P>
<P>I returned one evening from a pede&s;trian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> among the mountain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. It is probable that my return was &s;omewhat &s;ooner than was u&s;ual with
<PB N="191" REF="028752_0419_0FDBDB535C6B7B70">
me upon &s;imilar occa&s;ions. Be that as it will, I found upon entering the hou&s;e an apartment of which I occupied, that it was totally de&s;erted of its u&s;ual in|habitants. The woman and her children were gone out to enjoy the fre&s;hne&s;s of the breeze. The hu&s;|band was engaged in his u&s;ual without-door occu|pations. I opened for my&s;elf, and went into the kitchen of the family. Here, as I looked round, my eyes accidentally glanced upon a paper lying in one corner, which by &s;ome a&s;&s;ociation I was unable to explain, rou&s;ed in me a &s;trong &s;en&s;ation of &s;u&s;|picion and curio&s;ity. I eagerly went towards it, caught it up, and found it to be the very paper of the Wonderful and Surpri&s;ing Hi&s;tory of Caleb Williams, the di&s;covery of which towards the clo&s;e of my re&s;idence in London had produced in me &s;uch exqui&s;ite pain.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery at once cleared up all the my&s;|tery that had hung upon my late tran&s;actions. Abhorred and intolerable certainty &s;ucceeded to the doubts which had haunted my mind. It &s;truck me with the rapidity and irre&s;i&s;tible effect of lightning. I was like a man bla&s;ted, his head bare and expo&s;ed to the fury of the elements.</P>
<P>Was there no hope that remained to me? Was acquittal u&s;ele&s;s? Was there no period, pa&s;t or in pro&s;pect, that could give relief to my &s;ufferings? Was the odious and atrocious fal&s;hood that had been invented again&s;t me de&s;tined to follow me wherever I went, to &s;trip me of character, to de|prive me of the &s;ympathy and good will of man|kind, to wre&s;t from me the very bread by which life mu&s;t be &s;u&s;tained?</P>
<P>For the &s;pace perhaps of half an hour the agony I felt, from this termination to my late tranquillity, and the expectation it excited of that enmity which would follow me through every retreat, was
<PB N="192" REF="028752_0420_0FDBDB0C1B4FCA70">
&s;o great as to bereave me of all con&s;i&s;tent thinking and of the power of coming to any re&s;olution. As &s;oon as this hurricane of the mind &s;ub&s;ided, and the winds that impelled me this way and that were &s;till, one &s;tiff and ma&s;ter gale took its turn of a&s;cendancy, and drove me to an in&s;tant de&s;ertion of this once-cheri&s;hed retreat. I had no patience to enter into remon&s;trance and explanation with the unin&s;tructed inhabitants of my pre&s;ent re&s;idence. I had &s;een too much of the reign of triumphant fal&s;hood to have that &s;anguine confidence in the effects of my innocence, which would have &s;ug|ge&s;ted it&s;elf to the mind of any other per&s;on of my propen&s;ities and my age. I could not endure the thought of oppo&s;ing the venom that was thus &s;cattered again&s;t me, in detail and through its mi|nuter particles. If ever it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for me to encounter it, if I were pur&s;ued like a wild bea&s;t till I could no longer avoid turning upon my hunters, I would then turn upon the true author of this unprincipled attack. I would encounter the calumny in its &s;trong hold, I would rou&s;e my&s;elf to an exertion hitherto une&s;&s;ayed, and, by the firm|ne&s;s, intrepidity and unalterable con&s;tancy I &s;hould di&s;play, would yet compel mankind to believe that Mr. Falkland was a &s;uborner and a murderer.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>I HASTEN to the conclu&s;ion of my melancholy &s;tory. I began to write &s;oon after the period to which I have now conducted it. It has &s;erved me as a &s;ource of avocation for &s;everal years. For &s;ome time I had a melancholy con&s;olation in writing. I was better plea&s;ed to repa&s;s in my mind the particulars of calamities that had formerly afflicted me, than to look forward, as at other times I was too apt to do, to tho&s;e by which I might hereafter be overtaken. I conceived that my &s;tory faithfully dige&s;ted would carry in it an im|pre&s;&s;ion of truth that &s;ew men would be able to re&s;i&s;t; or at wor&s;t that, by leaving it behind me when! &s;hould no longer continue to exi&s;t, po&s;te|rity might be induced to do me ju&s;tice, and, &s;eeing in my example what &s;ort of evils are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon mankind by &s;ociety as it is at pre&s;ent con&s;tituted, might be inclined to turn their atten|tion upon the fountain from which &s;uch bitter waters have been accu&s;tomed to flow. But the&s;e motives have dimini&s;hed in their influence. I have contracted &s;omething too like a loathing for life and all its appendages. Writing, which was at fir&s;t a plea&s;ure, is changed into a burthen. I &s;hall compre&s;s into a &s;mall compa&s;s what yet remains to be told.</P>
<P>I found out not long after the period of which I am &s;peaking the preci&s;e cau&s;e of the my&s;terious rever&s;e I had experienced in my re&s;idence in Wales, and included in that cau&s;e what it was I
<PB N="194" REF="028752_0422_0FDBDB0CE7E55930">
had to look for in my future adventures. Mr. Falkland had taken the infernal Jones into his pay, a man in three re&s;pects mo&s;t critically qualified for the &s;ervice in which he was now engaged; by the unfeeling brutality of his temper, by the habits of his mind at once audacious and artful, and by the peculiar animo&s;ity and vengeance he had conceived again&s;t me. The employment to which this man was hired was that of following me from place to place for the purpo&s;e of bla&s;ting my reputation, and preventing me from the chance, by continuing long in one re&s;idence, of acquiring a character of integrity that might give new weight to any accu|&s;ation I might at a future time be induced to pre|fer. He had come to the &s;eat of my re&s;idence with the bricklayers and labourers I have men|tioned; and, while he took care to keep out of &s;ight &s;o far as related to me, was indu&s;trious in di&s;&s;eminating that which in the eye of the world &s;eemed to amount to a demon&s;tration of the profli|gacy and dete&s;tablene&s;s of my character. It was, no doubt, from him that the dete&s;ted &s;croll had been procured, which I had found in my habita|tion immediately prior to my quitting it. In all this Mr. Falkland, rea&s;oning upon his principles, was only employing a nece&s;&s;ary precaution. There was &s;omething in the temper of his mind that im|pre&s;&s;ed him with aver&s;ion to the idea of violently putting an end to my exi&s;tence; at the &s;ame time that unfortunately he could never deem him&s;elf &s;ufficiently &s;ecured again&s;t my recrimination, &s;o long as I remained alive. As to the fact of Jones being retained by him for this tremendous purpo&s;e, he by no means de&s;ired that it &s;hould become gene|rally known; but then neither did he look upon the po&s;&s;ibility of its being known with terror. It was already too notorious for his wi&s;hes, that I had
<PB N="195" REF="028752_0423_0FDBDB58E73EAD38">
advanced the mo&s;t odious charges again&s;t him. If he regarded me with abhorrence as the great adver|&s;ary of his fame, tho&s;e per&s;ons who had had oc|ca&s;ion to be at all acquainted with our hi&s;tory, did not entertain le&s;s abhorrence again&s;t me for my own &s;ake. If they knew all the pains he exerted in cau&s;ing my evil reputation to follow me, they would con&s;ider it as an act of impartial ju&s;tice, perhaps as a generous anxiety to prevent other men from being impo&s;ed upon and injured, as he had been.</P>
<P>What expedient was I to employ for the purpo&s;e of counteracting the meditated and barbarous pru|dence, which was thus de&s;tined in all changes of &s;cene to deprive me of the benefits and con&s;olations of human &s;ociety? There was one expedient again&s;t which I was ab&s;olutely determined, di&s;gui&s;e. I had experienced &s;o many mortifications and &s;uch intolerable re&s;traint when I had formerly had re|cour&s;e to it, it was a&s;&s;ociated in my under&s;tanding with &s;en&s;ations of &s;uch acute angui&s;h, that my mind was thus far entirely convinced: Life was not worth purcha&s;ing at &s;o high a price! But, though in this re&s;pect I was wholly re&s;olved, there was another point that did not appear to me &s;o material, and in which therefore I was willing to accommodate my|&s;elf to circum&s;tances. I was contented, if that would in&s;ure my peace, to &s;ubmit to the otherwi&s;e unmanly expedient of pa&s;&s;ing by a different name.</P>
<P>But the change of my name, the abruptne&s;s with which I removed from place to place, the remote|ne&s;s and the ob&s;curity which I propo&s;ed to my&s;elf in the choice of my abode, were all in&s;ufficient to elude the &s;agacity of Jones, or the unrelenting con|&s;tancy with which Mr. Falkland incited my tor|mentor to pur&s;ue me. Whither&s;oever I removed my&s;elf, it was not long before I had occa&s;ion to
<PB N="196" REF="028752_0424_0FDBDB0D8F251EF8">
perceive this dete&s;ted adver&s;ary in my rear. No words can enable me to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ju&s;tice to the &s;en&s;ations which this circum&s;tance produced in me. It was like what has been de&s;cribed of the eye of Omni|&s;cience pur&s;uing the guilty &s;inner, and darting a ray that awakens him to new &s;en&s;ibility, at every moment when otherwi&s;e exhau&s;ted nature would lull him into a temporary oblivio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the reproaches of his con&s;cience. Sleep fled from my eyes. No walls could hide me from the di&s;cernment of this hated foe. Every where his indu&s;try was unwea|ried to create for me new di&s;tre&s;s. Re&s;t I had none: relief I had none: never could I count upon an in&s;tant's &s;ecurity: never could I wrap my&s;elf for a moment in the &s;hroud of oblivion. The mi|nutes in which I did not actually perceive him, were contaminated and bla&s;ted with the certain ex|pectation of his &s;peedy interference. In my fir&s;t retreat I had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome weeks of delu&s;ive tran|quillity, but never after was I happy enough to at|tain &s;o much as that &s;hadowy gratification. I &s;pent &s;ome years in this dreadful vici&s;&s;itude of pain. My &s;en&s;ations at certain periods partook of in&s;anity.</P>
<P>It has already appeared that I was not of a tem|per to endure calamity without endeavouring by every means I could devi&s;e to delude and di&s;arm it. Recollecting, as I was habituated to do, the various projects by which my &s;ituation could be meliorated, the que&s;tion in one in&s;tance occurred to me: Why &s;hould I be hara&s;&s;ed by the pur&s;uit of this Jones; why, man to man, may I not by the powers of my mind attain the a&s;cendancy over him? at pre&s;ent he appears to be the per&s;ecutor and I the per&s;ecu|ted: is not this difference the mere creature of the imagination? May I not employ my ingenuity to vex him with difficulties and laugh at the endle&s;s labour to which he will be condemned?</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="028752_0425_0FDBDB5AE962C5B8">
Alas, this is a &s;peculation for a mind at ea&s;e! It is not the per&s;ecution; but the cata&s;trophe which is annexed to it, that makes the difference between the tyrant and the &s;ufferer! In mere corporal ex|ertion the hunter perhaps is upon a level with the mi&s;erable animal he pur&s;ues! But could it be for|gotten by either of us, that at every &s;tage Jones was to gratify his malignant pa&s;&s;ions by di&s;&s;eminating charges of the mo&s;t infamous nature and exciting again&s;t me the abhorrence of every hone&s;t bo&s;om, while I was to &s;u&s;tain the &s;till repeated annihilation of my peace, my character and my bread? Could I by any refinement of my rea&s;on convert this dreadful &s;eries into &s;port? I had no philo&s;ophy that qualified me for &s;o extraordinary an effort. If under other circum&s;tances I could even have entertained &s;o &s;trange an imagination, I was re|&s;trained in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance by the nece&s;&s;ity of providing for my&s;elf the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and the fetters which through that nece&s;&s;ity the forms of human &s;ociety impo&s;ed upon my exertions.</P>
<P>In one of tho&s;e changes of re&s;idence to which my mi&s;erable fate repeatedly compelled me, I met, upon a road which I was obliged to traver&s;e, the friend of my youth, my earlie&s;t and be&s;t beloved friend, the venerable Collins. It was one of tho&s;e misfortunes which &s;erved to accumulate my di&s;tre&s;s, that this man had quitted the i&s;land of Great Britain only a very few weeks before that fatal rever&s;e of fortune which had ever &s;ince pur|&s;ued me with unrelenting eagerne&s;s. Mr. Falk|land, in addition to the large e&s;tate he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in England, had a very valuable plantation in the We&s;t Indies. This property had been greatly mi&s;managed by the per&s;on who had the direction of it on the &s;pot; and, after various promi&s;es and eva&s;ions on his part, which, however they might
<PB N="198" REF="028752_0426_0FDBDB12EDD978F8">
&s;erve to beguile the patience of Mr. Falkland, had been attended with no &s;alutary fruits, it was re&s;olved that Mr. Collins &s;hould go over in per&s;on to rectify the abu&s;es which had &s;o long prevailed. There had even been &s;ome idea of his re&s;iding &s;everal years, if not &s;ettling finally, upon the plantation. From that hour to the pre&s;ent I had never received the &s;malle&s;t intelligence re|&s;pecting him.</P>
<P>I had always con&s;idered the circum&s;tance of his critical ab&s;ence as one of my &s;evere&s;t mis|fortunes. Mr. Collins had been one of the fir&s;t per&s;ons even in the period of my infancy to con|ceive hopes of me as of &s;omething above the com|mon &s;tandard, and had contributed more than any other to encourage and a&s;&s;i&s;t my juvenile &s;tu|dies. He had been the executor of the little pro|perty of my father, who had fixed upon him for that purpo&s;e in con&s;ideration of the mutual affec|tion that exi&s;ted between us; and I &s;eemed on every account to have more claim upon his pro|tection than upon that of any other human being. I had always believed that, had he been pre&s;ent in the cri&s;is of my fortune, he would have felt conviction of my innocence; and, convinced him|&s;elf, would by means of the venerablene&s;s and energy of his character have interpo&s;ed &s;o effectu|ally, as to have &s;aved me the greater part of my &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes.</P>
<P>No &s;ight therefore could give me a purer de|light than that which now pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my eyes. It was &s;ome time however before either of us recogni&s;ed the per&s;on of the other. Mr. Collins looked at lea&s;t ten years older than he had none when I la&s;t &s;aw him, in addition to which he was in his pre&s;ent appearance pale, &s;ickly and thin. The&s;e unfavourable effects had been pro|duced
<PB N="199" REF="028752_0427_0FDBDB5FCFC4B670">
by the change of climate, particularly try|ing to per&s;ons in an advanced period of life. Add to which, I &s;uppo&s;ed him to be at that moment in the We&s;t Indies. I was probably as much al|tered in the period that had elap&s;ed as he had been. I was the fir&s;t to recollect him. He was on hor&s;eback; I on foot. I had &s;uffered him to pa&s;s me. In a moment the full idea of who he was ru&s;hed upon my mind: I ran; I called with an impetuous voice; I was unable to re&s;train the vehemence of my emotions.</P>
<P>The ardour of my feelings di&s;gui&s;ed my u&s;ual tone of &s;peaking, which otherwi&s;e Mr. Collins would infallibly have recogni&s;ed. His &s;ight was already dim; he pulled up his hor&s;e till I &s;hould overtake him; and then &s;aid, Who are you? I do not know you.</P>
<P>My father! exclaimed I, embracing one of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nees with fervour and delight, I am your &s;on! once your little Caleb, whom you a thou&s;and times loaded with your kindne&s;s!</P>
<P>The unexpected repetition of my name gave a kind of &s;huddering emotion to my friend, which was however checked by his age, and the calm and benevolent philo&s;ophy that formed one of the mo&s;t con&s;picuous of his habits.</P>
<P>I did not expect to &s;ee you! replied he.&mdash;I did not wi&s;h it!</P>
<P>My be&s;t, my olde&s;t friend! an&s;wered I, re&s;pect blending it&s;elf with my impatience, Do not &s;ay &s;o! I have not a friend any where in the whole world, but you! In you at lea&s;t let me find &s;ym|pathy and reciprocal affection! If you knew how anxiou&s;ly I have thought of you during the whole period of your ab&s;ence, you would not thus griev|ou&s;ly di&s;appoint me in your return.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="028752_0428_0FDBDB8A2AD3B6F0">
How is it, &s;aid Mr. Collins gravely, that you have been reduced to this forlorn condition? Was it not the inevitable con&s;equence of your own ac|tions?</P>
<P>The actions of others, not mine! Does not your heart tell you that I am innocent?</P>
<P>No. My ob&s;ervation of your early character taught me that you would be extraordinary. But unhappily all extraordinary men are not good men; that &s;eems to be a lottery, dependent on circum|&s;tances apparently the mo&s;t trivial.</P>
<P>Will you hear my ju&s;tification? I am as &s;ure as I am of my exi&s;tence that I can convince you of my purity.</P>
<P>Certainly, if you wi&s;h it, I will hear you. But that mu&s;t not be ju&s;t now. I could have been glad to decline it wholly. At my age I am not fit for the &s;torm, and I am not &s;o &s;anguine as you in my expectation of the re&s;ult. Of what would you con|vince me? That Mr. Falkland is a &s;uborner and a murderer?</P>
<P>I made no an&s;wer. My &s;ilence was an affirma|tive to this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>And what benefit will re&s;ult from this convic|tion? I have known you a promi&s;ing boy, who&s;e character might turn to one &s;ide or the other as events &s;hould decide. I have known Mr. Falkland in his maturer years, and have always admired him as the living model of liberality and goodne&s;s. If you could change all my ideas, and &s;how me that there was no criterion by which vice might be pre|vented from being mi&s;taken for virtue, what be|nefit would ari&s;e from that? I mu&s;t part with all my interior con&s;olation, and all my external con|nections. And for what? What is it you pro|po&s;e? The death of Mr. Falkland by the hands of the hangman?</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="028752_0429_0FDBD88669F30B50">
No. I will not hurt a hair of his head, unle&s;s compelled to it by a principle of defence. But &s;urely you owe me ju&s;tice?</P>
<P>What ju&s;tice? The ju&s;tice of proclaiming your innocence? You know what con&s;equences are annexed to that. But I do not believe I &s;hall find you innocent. If you even &s;ucceed in perplexing my under&s;tanding, you will not &s;ucceed in enlight|ening it. Such is the &s;tate of mankind, that in|nocence when involved in circum&s;tances of &s;u&s;|picion can &s;carcely ever make out a demon&s;tration of its purity, and guilt can often make us feel an in&s;urmountable reluctance to the pronouncing it guilt. Meanwhile for the purcha&s;e of this uncer|tainty I mu&s;t &s;acrifice all the remaining comforts of my life. I believe Mr. Falkland to be virtuous, but I know him to be prejudiced. He would never forgive me even this accidental parley, if by any means he &s;hould come to be acquainted with it.</P>
<P>Oh, argue not the con&s;equences that are po&s;&s;ible to re&s;ult! an&s;wered I impatiently. I have a right to your kindne&s;s; I have a right to your a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance!</P>
<P>You have them. You have them to a certain degree; and it is not likely by any proce&s;s of ex|amination you can have them entire. You know my habits of thinking. I regard you as vicious; but I do not con&s;ider the vicious as proper objects of indignation and &s;corn. I con&s;ider you as a ma|chine: you are not con&s;tituted, I am afraid, to be greatly u&s;eful to your fellow men; but you did not make your&s;elf; you are ju&s;t what circum&s;tances irre&s;i&s;tibly compelled you to be. I am &s;orry for your ill properties; but I entertain no enmity again&s;t you, nothing but benevolence. Con&s;ider|ing you in the light in which I at pre&s;ent con&s;ider you, I am ready to contribute every thing in my
<PB N="202" REF="028752_0430_0FDBD887EDDADC70">
power to your real advantage, and would gladly a&s;&s;i&s;t you, if I knew how, in detecting and extir|pating the errors that have mi&s;led you. You have di&s;appointed me, but I have no reproaches to utter: it is more nece&s;&s;ary for me to feel compa&s;&s;ion for you, than that I &s;hould accumulate your misfortune by my cen&s;ures.</P>
<P>What could I &s;ay to &s;uch a man as this? Amia|ble, incomparable man! Never was my mind more painfully divided than at that moment. The more he excited my admiration, the more imperiou&s;ly did my heart command me, whatever were the price it &s;hould co&s;t, to extort his friend&s;hip. I was per|&s;uaded that &s;evere duty required of him, that he &s;hould reject all per&s;onal con&s;iderations, that he &s;hould proceed re&s;olutely to the inve&s;tigation of the truth, and that, if he found the re&s;ult terminating in my favour, he &s;hould re&s;ign all his advantages, and, de&s;erted as I was by the world, make a com|mon cau&s;e, and endeavour to compen&s;ate the gene|ral inju&s;tice. But was it for me to force this con|duct upon him, if, now in his declining years, his own fortitude &s;hrunk from it? Alas, neither he nor I fore&s;aw the dreadful cata&s;trophe that was &s;o clo&s;ely impending! Otherwi&s;e I am well a&s;&s;ured, that no tenderne&s;s for his remaining tranquillity would have withheld him from a compliance with my wi&s;hes! On the other hand, could I pretend to know what evils might re&s;ult to him from his declaring him&s;elf my advocate? Might not his integrity be brow-beaten and defeated as mine had been? Did the imbecility of his grey hairs afford no advantage to my terrible adver&s;ary in the con|te&s;t? Might not Mr. Falkland reduce him to a condition as wretched and low as mine? After all, was it not vice in me to de&s;ire to involve an|other man as my champion? If he could protect
<PB N="203" REF="028752_0431_0FDBD88FF8D90638">
me, had I not yet energy and wi&s;dom and con&s;cious purity enough to protect my&s;elf?</P>
<P>Influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations, I a&s;&s;ented to his views. I a&s;&s;ented to be thought hardly of by the man in the world who&s;e e&s;teem I mo&s;t ardently de&s;ired, rather than involve him in po&s;&s;ible cala|mity. I a&s;&s;ented to the re&s;igning what appeared to me at that moment as the la&s;t practicable com|fort of my life, a comfort upon the thought of which, while I &s;urrendered it, my mind dwelt with unde&s;cribable longings. Mr. Collins was deeply affected with the apparent ingenuou&s;ne&s;s with which I expre&s;&s;ed my feelings. The &s;ecret &s;truggle of his mind was, Can this be hypocri&s;y? The in|dividual with whom I am conferring, if virtuous, is one of the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;tedly virtuous per&s;ons in the world. We tore our&s;elves from each other. Mr. Collins promi&s;ed, as far as he was able, to have an eye upon my vici&s;&s;itudes, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in every re&s;pect that was at all con&s;i&s;tent with a ju&s;t recollection of con&s;equences. Thus I parted as it were with my right arm; and voluntarily con&s;ented, thus maimed and forlorn, to encounter all the evils that were yet in &s;tore for me.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING made an experiment of various &s;itu|ations, all of them with one uniform re&s;ult, I at length determined to remove my&s;elf, if po&s;&s;ible, from the reach of my per&s;ecutor, by going into voluntary bani&s;hment from my native &s;oil. But it &s;eemed this &s;lender con&s;olation was to be denied to me by the inexorable Falkland. At the time that the project was formed by me I was at no great di&s;tance from the ea&s;t coa&s;t of the i&s;land, and I determined to take &s;hip at Harwich, and pa&s;s im|mediately into Holland. I accordingly repaired to that place, and went almo&s;t as &s;oon as I arrived to the port. But there was no ve&s;&s;el ju&s;t at that time ready to &s;ail. I left the port, and withdrew to an inn, where after &s;ome time I retired to a chamber. I was &s;carcely there, before the door of the room was opened, and the man, who&s;e countenance was of all others mo&s;t hateful to my eyes, Jones, entered the apartment. He &s;hut the door again as &s;oon as he entered.</P>
<P>Young&s;ter, &s;aid he, I have a little private intel|ligence to communicate to you. I come as a friend, and that I may &s;ave you a labour-in-vain trouble. If you con&s;ider what I have to &s;ay in that light, it will be the better for you. It is my bu&s;ine&s;s now, do you &s;ee, for want of a better, to &s;ee that you do not break out of bounds. Not that I much matter having one man for my employer, or dancing attendance after another's heels; but I have a
<PB N="205" REF="028752_0433_0FDBDB60E872F330">
&s;pecial kindne&s;s for you, for &s;ome good turns that you wot of, and therefore I do not &s;tand upon cere|monies! You have led me a very pretty round already; and, out of the love I bear you, you &s;hall lead me as much farther, if you will. But beware the &s;alt &s;eas! They are out of my orders. You are a pri&s;oner at pre&s;ent, and I believe all your life will remain &s;o. Thanks to the milk-and-water &s;oftne&s;s of your former ma&s;ter! if I had the order|ing of the&s;e things, it &s;hould go with you in an|other fa&s;hion. As long as you think proper, you are a pri&s;oner within the rules; and the rules with which the &s;oft-hearted &s;quire indulges you are all England, Scotland and Wales. But you are not to go out of the&s;e climates. The &s;quire is deter|mined you &s;hall never pa&s;s the reach of his di&s;|po&s;al. He has therefore given orders that, when|ever you attempt &s;o to do, you &s;hall be converted from a pri&s;oner at large to a pri&s;oner in the pro|perer meaning of the word. A friend of mine fol|lowed you ju&s;t now to the harbour; I was within call; and, if there had been any appearance of your &s;etting your foot from land, we &s;hould have been with you in a trice, and laid you fa&s;t by the heels. I would advi&s;e you for the future to keep at a proper di&s;tance from the &s;ea, for fear of the wor&s;t. You &s;ee I tell you all this for your good. For my part I &s;hould be better &s;atisfied, if you were in limbo, with a rope about your neck, and a comfortable bird's eye pro&s;pect to the gallows: but I do as I am directed; and &s;o, good night to you!</P>
<P>The intelligence thus conveyed to me occa&s;ioned an in&s;tantaneous revolution in both my intellectual and animal &s;y&s;tem. I di&s;dained to an&s;wer or take the &s;malle&s;t notice of the fiend by whom it was de|livered. It is now three days &s;ince I received it,
<PB N="206" REF="028752_0434_0FDBDB62A5F66240">
and from that moment to the pre&s;ent my blood has been in a perpetual ferment. My thoughts wan|der from one idea of horror to another with incre|dible rapidity. I have had no &s;leep. I have &s;carcely remained in one po&s;ture for a minute to|gether. It has been with the utmo&s;t difficulty that I have been able to command my&s;elf far enough to add a few pages to my &s;tory. But, uncertain as I am of the events of each &s;ucceeding hour, I thought it right to force my&s;elf to the performance of this ta&s;k. All is not right within me. How it will terminate God knows. I &s;ometimes fear that I &s;hall be wholly de&s;erted of my rea&s;on.</P>
<P>What&mdash;dark, my&s;terious, unfeeling, unrelent|ing tyrant!&mdash;is it come to this?&mdash;When Nero and Caligula &s;wayed the Roman &s;ceptre, it was a fear|ful thing to offend the&s;e bloody rulers. The em|pire had already &s;pread it&s;elf from climate to cli|mate, and from &s;ea to &s;ea. If their unhappy vic|tim fled to the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, where the lumi|nary of day &s;eems to us fir&s;t to a&s;cend from the waves of the ocean, the power of the tyrant was &s;till behind him. If he withdrew to the we&s;t, to He&s;perian darkne&s;s, and the &s;hores of barbarian Thule, &s;till he was not &s;afe from his gore-drenched foe.&mdash;Falkland! art thou the offspring in whom the lineaments of the&s;e tyrants are faithfully pre|&s;erved? Was the world with all its climates made in vain for thy helple&s;s, unoffending victim?</P>
<P>Tremble!</P>
<P>Tyrants have trembled &s;urrounded with whole armies of their Jani&s;&s;aries! What &s;hould make thee inacce&s;&s;ible to my fury?&mdash;No, I will u&s;e no dan|gers! I will unfold a tale&mdash;! I will &s;how thee for what thou art to the world, and all the men that live &s;hall confe&s;s my truth!&mdash;Did&s;t thou imagine that I was altogether pa&s;&s;ive, a mere worm, or|ganized to feel &s;en&s;ations of pain, but no emo|tion of re&s;entment? Did&s;t thou imagine that
<PB N="207" REF="028752_0435_0FDBDB6420FAC3A8">
there was no danger in inflicting on me pains how|ever great, mi&s;eries however dreadful? Did&s;t thou believe me impotent, imbecil and idiot-like, with no under&s;tanding to contrive thy ruin, and no energy to perpetrate it?</P>
<P>I will tell a tale&mdash;! The ju&s;tice of the country &s;hall hear me! The elements of nature in univer&s;al uproar &s;hall not interrupt me! I will &s;peak with a voice more fearful than thunder!&mdash;Why &s;hould I be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak from any di&s;honourable motive? I am un|der no pro&s;ecution now! I &s;hall not now appear to be endeavouring to remove a criminal indictment from my&s;elf, by throwing it back on its author!&mdash;Shall I regret the ruin that will overwhelm thee! Too long have I been tender-hearted and forbearing! What benefit has ever re&s;ulted from my mi&s;taken clemency? There is no evil thou ha&s;t &s;crupled to accumulate upon me! Neither will I be more &s;cru|pulous! Thou ha&s;t &s;hown no mercy; and thou &s;halt receive none!&mdash;I mu&s;t be calm! Bold as a lion, yet collected!</P>
<P>This is a moment pregnant with fate. I know&mdash;I think I know&mdash;that I will be triumphant, and cru&s;h my &s;eemingly omnipotent foe. But &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e, at lea&s;t he &s;hall not be every way &s;uc|ce&s;sful. His fame &s;hall not be immortal as he thinks. The&s;e papers &s;hall pre&s;erve the truth: they &s;hall one day be publi&s;hed, and then the world &s;hall do ju&s;tice on us both. Recollecting that, I &s;hall not die wholly without con&s;olation. It is not to be endured that fal&s;hood and tyranny &s;hould reign for ever.</P>
<P>How impotent are the precautions of man again&s;t the eternally-exi&s;ting laws of the intellectual world? This Falkland has invented again&s;t me every &s;pecies of foul accu&s;ation? He has hunted me from city to city. He has drawn his lines of circumvallation round me that I may not e&s;cape. He has kept his
<PB N="208" REF="028752_0436_0FDBDB67DDAA48B8">
&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">enters of human prey for ever at my heels. He may hunt me out of the world.&mdash;In vain! With this engine, this little pen I defeat all his machina|tions; I &s;tab him in the very point he was mo&s;t &s;olicitous to defend!</P>
<P>Collins! I now addre&s;s my&s;elf to you. I have con&s;ented that you &s;hould yield me no a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my pre&s;ent terrible &s;ituation. I am content to die rather than do any thing injurious to your felicity.&mdash;But, remember,&mdash;you are my father &s;till!&mdash;I conjure you, by all the love you ever bore me, by the benefits you have conferred on me, by the forbearance and kindne&s;s towards you that now penetrates my &s;oul, by my innocence&mdash;for, if the&s;e be the la&s;t words I &s;hall ever write, I die prote&s;ting my innocence!&mdash;by all the&s;e or whatever tie more &s;acred has influence on your &s;oul, I conjure you, li&s;ten to my la&s;t reque&s;t! Pre&s;erve the&s;e papers from de&s;truction, and pre&s;erve them from Falkland? It is all I a&s;k! I have taken care to provide a &s;afe mode of conveying them into your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and I have a firm confidence which I will not &s;uffer to depart from me, that by &s;ome means or other they will one day find their way to the public!</P>
<P>The pen lingers in my trembling fingers!&mdash;Is there any thing I have left un&s;aid?&mdash;The contents of the fatal che&s;t from which originated all my misfortunes I have never been able to a&s;certain. I once thought it contained &s;ome murderous in&s;tru|ment or relique connected with the fate of the un|happy Tyrrel. I am now per&s;uaded that the &s;ecret it inclo&s;ed was a faithful narrative of that and its concomitant tran&s;actions to be re&s;erved in ca&s;e of the wor&s;t, that, if by any unfore&s;een event the guilt of Falkland &s;hould ever come to be fully di&s;|clo&s;ed, it might contribute to redeem the wreck of his reputation. But it is no matter. If Falkland &s;hall never be detected to the &s;atisfaction of the
<PB N="209" REF="028752_0437_0FDBDB693044EF00">
world, &s;uch a narrative will probably never &s;ee the light. In that ca&s;e this &s;tory of mine may amply, &s;everely perhaps &s;upply its place.</P>
<P>I know not what it is that renders me thus &s;o|lemn. I have a &s;ecret foreboding as if I &s;hould never again be ma&s;ter of my&s;elf. If I &s;ucceed in what I now meditate re&s;pecting Falkland, my precaution in removing the&s;e papers will have been unnece&s;&s;ary; I &s;hall no longer be reduced to arti|fice and eva&s;ion. If I fail, the precaution will ap|pear to be wi&s;ely cho&s;en.</P>

<P>ALL is over. I have carried into execution my meditated attempt. My &s;ituation is totally chang|ed; I now &s;it down to give an account of it. For &s;everal weeks after the completion of this dreadful bu&s;ine&s;s, my mind was in too tumultuous a &s;tate to permit me to write. I think I &s;hall now be able to arrange my thoughts &s;ufficiently for that purpo&s;e. Great God! how wondrous, how terrible are the events that have intervened &s;ince I was la&s;t employ|ed in a &s;imilar manner! It is no wonder that my thoughts were &s;olemn, and my mind filled with horrible forebodings!</P>
<P>Having formed my re&s;olution, I &s;et out from Harwich for the metropolitan town of the county in which Mr. Falkland re&s;ided. Jones I well knew was in my rear. That was of no con&s;equence to me. He might wonder at the direction I pur&s;ued, but he could not tell with what purpo&s;e I pur&s;ued it. My de&s;ign was a &s;ecret carefully locked up in my own brea&s;t. It was not without a &s;entiment of terror that I entered a town which had been the &s;cene of my long impri&s;onment. I proceeded to the hou&s;e of the chief magi&s;trate the in&s;tant I ar|rived, that I might give no time to my adver&s;ary to counterwork my proceeding.</P>
<P>I told him who I was, and that I was come from a di&s;tant part of the kingdom for the purpo&s;e of rendering him the medium of a charge of murder
<PB N="211" REF="028752_0439_0FDBDB70A8EDFF30">
again&s;t my former ma&s;ter. My name was already familiar to him. He an&s;wered that he could not take cognizance of my depo&s;ition, that I was an object of univer&s;al execration in that part of the world, and he was determined upon no account to be the vehicle of my depravity.</P>
<P>I warned him to con&s;ider well what he was about. I called upon him for no favour; I only applied to him in the regular exerci&s;e of his func|tion. Would he take upon him to &s;ay that he had a right at his plea&s;ure to &s;uppre&s;s a charge of this complicated nature? I had to accu&s;e Mr. Falkland of repeated murders. The perpetrator knew that I was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the truth upon the &s;ub|ject; and, knowing that, I went perpetually in danger of my life from his malice and revenge. I was determined to go through with the bu&s;ine&s;s, if ju&s;tice were to be obtained from any court in England. Upon what pretence did he refu&s;e my depo&s;ition? I was in every re&s;pect a competent witne&s;s. I was of age to under&s;tand the nature of an oath; I was in my perfect &s;en&s;es; I was un|tarni&s;hed by the verdict of any jury, or the &s;entence of any judge. His private opinion of my charac|ter could not alter the law of the land. I demand|ed to be confronted with Mr. Falkland, and I was well a&s;&s;ured I &s;hould &s;ub&s;tantiate the charge to the &s;atisfaction of the whole world. If he did not think proper to apprehend him upon my &s;ingle te&s;|timony, I &s;hould be &s;atisfied if he only &s;ent him notice of the charge and &s;ummoned him to appear.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trate finding me thus re&s;olute, thought proper a little to lower his tone. He no longer ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to comply with my requi&s;ition, but conde&s;cended to expo&s;tulate with me. He re|pre&s;ented to me Mr. Falkland's health which had for &s;ome years been exceedingly indifferent, his
<PB N="212" REF="028752_0440_0FDBDB746760F690">
having been already once brought to trial, upon the &s;ame accu&s;ation, the diabolical malice in which alone my proceeding mu&s;t have originated, and the tenfold ruin it would bring down upon my own head. I &s;hould be pilloried for perjury, if not hanged for the robbery, in relation to which Mr. Falkland had &s;o generou&s;ly &s;pared me upon a for|mer occa&s;ion. To all the&s;e repre&s;entations my an|&s;wer was &s;hort. I was determined to go on, and would abide the con&s;equences. A &s;ummons was at length granted, and notice &s;ent to Mr. Falkland of the charge preferred again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Three days elap&s;ed before any farther &s;tep could be taken in this bu&s;ine&s;s. This interval in no de|gree contributed to tranquilli&s;e my mind. The thought of preferring a capital accu&s;ation again&s;t, and ha&s;tening the death of &s;uch a man as Mr. Falkland, was by no means an opiate to reflexion. At one time I commended the action, either as ju&s;t revenge (for the benevolence of my nature was in a great degree turned to &s;our), or as nece&s;|&s;ary &s;elf-defence, or as that which in an impartial and philanthropical e&s;timate included the &s;malle&s;t evil. At another time I was haunted with doubts. But, &s;pite of the&s;e variations of &s;entiment, I uni|formly determined to per&s;i&s;t; I felt as if impelled by an unconquerable nece&s;&s;ity. The con&s;equences were &s;uch as might well appal the &s;toute&s;t heart. Either the ignominious execution of a man whom I had once &s;o deeply venerated, and whom now I &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pected not to be without his claims to veneration; or a confirmation, perhaps an increa&s;e, of the calamities I had &s;o endured. Yet the&s;e I pre|ferred to a &s;tate of uncertainty. I de&s;ired to know the wor&s;t; to put an end to the hope, however faint, which had been &s;o long my torment; and above all to exhau&s;t and fini&s;h the catalogue of ex|pedients
<PB N="213" REF="028752_0441_0FDBDB75EB15A9C0">
that were within my di&s;po&s;ition. My mind was worked up to a &s;tate little &s;hort of frenzy. My body was in a burning fever with the agita|tion of my thoughts. When I laid my hand upon my bo&s;om or my head, it &s;eemed to &s;corch them with the fervency of its heat. I could not &s;it &s;till for a moment. I panted with ince&s;&s;ant de&s;ire that the dreadful cri&s;is I had &s;o eagerly invoked were come, and were over.</P>
<P>After an interval of three days I met Mr. Falk|land in the pre&s;ence of the magi&s;trate to whom I had applied upon the &s;ubject. I had only two hours notice to prepare my&s;elf, Mr. Falkland &s;eem|ing as eager as I to have the que&s;tion brought to a cri&s;is, and laid at re&s;t for ever. I had an opportu|nity before the examination to learn that Mr. Fo|re&s;ter was gone upon &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s on an excur&s;ion to the continent, and that Collins, who&s;e health when I &s;aw him was in a very precarious &s;tate, was at this time confined with alarming illne&s;s. His con&s;titution had been wholly broken with his We&s;t Indian voyage. The audience I met at the hou&s;e of the magi&s;trate con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal gentlemen and others &s;elected for the purpo&s;e, the plan being to find a medium between the &s;u&s;picious air of a private examination, and the indelicacy as it was &s;tyled of an examination expo&s;ed to the remark of every accidental &s;pectator.</P>
<P>I can conceive of no &s;hock greater than that I received from the &s;ight of Mr. Falkland. His ap|pearance on the la&s;t occa&s;ion on which we met had been haggard, gho&s;t-like and wild, energy in his ge&s;tures and frenzy in his a&s;pect. It was now the appearance of a corp&s;e. He was brought in in a chair unable to &s;tand, fatigued and almo&s;t de&s;troyed by the journey he had ju&s;t taken. His vi&s;age was colourle&s;s; his limbs de&s;titute of motion, almo&s;t

of life. His head reclined upon his bo&s;om, except that now and then he li&s;ted it up and opened his eyes with a languid glance, immediately after which he &s;unk back into his former apparent in|&s;en&s;ibility. He &s;eemed not to have three hours to live. He had kept his chamber for &s;everal weeks; but the &s;ummons of the magi&s;trate had been de|livered to him at his bed-&s;ide; his orders re&s;pecting letters and written papers being &s;o peremptory that no one dared to di&s;obey them. Upon reading the paper he was &s;eized with a very dangerous fit; but, as &s;oon as he recovered, he in&s;i&s;ted upon being conveyed with all practicable expedition to the place of appointment. Falkland in the mo&s;t helple&s;s &s;tate was &s;till Falkland, firm in command, and capable to extort obedience from every one that approached him.</P>
<P>What a &s;ight was this to me! Till the moment that Falkland was pre&s;ented to my view, my brea&s;t was &s;teeled to pity. I thought that I had coolly en|tered into the rea&s;on of the ca&s;e (pa&s;&s;ion in a &s;tate of &s;olemn and omnipotent vehemence always ap|pears to be coolne&s;s to him in whom it domineers); and that I had determined impartially and ju&s;tly. I believed that, if Mr. Falkland were permitted to per&s;i&s;t in his &s;chemes, we mu&s;t both of us be completely wretched. I believed that it was in my power by the re&s;olution I had formed to throw my &s;hare of this wretchedne&s;s from me and that his could &s;carcely be increa&s;ed. It appeared therefore to my mind to be a mere piece of equity and ju&s;tice, &s;uch as an impartial &s;pectator would de&s;ire, that one per&s;on &s;hould be mi&s;erable in preference to two, that one per&s;on rather than two &s;hould be in|capacitated from acting his part, and contributing his &s;hare to the general good. I thought that in this bu&s;ine&s;s I had ri&s;en &s;uperior to per&s;onal con&s;i|derations,
<PB N="215" REF="028752_0443_0FDBDB7BE8F5E6A0">
and judged with a total neglect of the mi&s;erable &s;ugge&s;tions of &s;elf-regard. It is true Mr. Falkland was mortal: but, notwith&s;tanding his apparent decay, he might live long. Ought I to &s;ubmit to wa&s;te the be&s;t years of my life in my pre&s;ent wretched &s;ituation? He had declared that his reputation &s;hould be for ever inviolate; this was his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, the thought that worked his &s;oul to madne&s;s. He would probably therefore leave a legacy of per&s;ecution to be received by me from the hands of Jones or &s;ome other villain equally atrocious, when he &s;hould him&s;elf be no more. Now or never was the time for me to re|deem my future life from endle&s;s woe.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e fine-&s;pun rea&s;onings vani&s;hed be|fore the object that was now exhibited to me. Shall I trample upon a man thus dreadfully re|duced? Shall I point my animo&s;ity again&s;t one whom the &s;y&s;tem of nature has brought down to the grave? Shall I poi&s;on with &s;ounds the mo&s;t in|tolerable to his ears the la&s;t moments of a man like Falkland? It is impo&s;&s;ible. There mu&s;t have been &s;ome dreadful mi&s;take in the train of argument that per&s;uaded me to be the author of this hateful &s;cene. There mu&s;t have been a better and more magnanimous remedy to the evils under which I groaned.</P>
<P>It was too late. The mi&s;take I had committed was now gone pa&s;t all power of recal. Here was Falkland &s;olemnly brought before a magi&s;trate to an&s;wer a charge of murder. Here I &s;tood, having already declared my&s;elf the author of the charge, gravely and &s;acredly pledged to &s;upport it. This was my &s;ituation; and, thus &s;ituated, I was called upon immediately to act. My whole frame &s;hook. I would eagerly have con&s;ented that that moment &s;hould have been the la&s;t of my exi&s;tence. I how|ever
<PB N="216" REF="028752_0444_0FDBDB80C4C396D8">
believed that the conduct now mo&s;t indi&s;pen|&s;ably incumbent on me, was to lay the emotions of my &s;oul naked before my hearers. I looked fir&s;t at Mr. Falkland, and then at the magi&s;trate and at|tendants, and then at Mr. Falkland again. My voice was &s;uffocated with agony. I began:</P>
<P>Why cannot I recal the four la&s;t days of my life? How was it po&s;&s;ible for me to be &s;o eager, &s;o ob&s;tinate in a purpo&s;e &s;o diabolical? Oh, that I had li&s;tened to the expo&s;tulations of the magi&s;trate that hears me, or &s;ubmitted to the well-meant de&s;|poti&s;m of his authority! Hitherto I have only been mi&s;erable; henceforth I &s;hall account my&s;elf ba&s;e! Hitherto, though hardly treated by mankind, I &s;tood acquitted at the bar of my own con&s;cience. I had not filled up the mea&s;ure of my wretched|ne&s;s!</P>
<P>Would to God it were po&s;&s;ible for me to retire from this &s;cene without uttering another word! I would brave the con&s;equences&mdash;I would &s;ub|mit to any imputation of cowardice, fal&s;hood and profligacy, rather than add to the weight of misfortune with which Mr. Falkland is over|whelmed. But the &s;ituation and the demands of Mr. Falkland him&s;elf forbid me. He, in compa&s;|&s;ion for who&s;e fallen &s;tate I would willingly forget every intere&s;t of my own, would compel me to ac|cu&s;e, that he might enter upon his ju&s;tification.&mdash;I will confe&s;s every &s;entiment of my heart.</P>
<P>No penitence, no angui&s;h can expiate the folly and the cruelty of this la&s;t act I have perpetrated. But Mr. Falkland well knows&mdash;I affirm it in his pre&s;ence&mdash;how unwillingly I have proceeded to this extremity. I have reverenced him; he was wor|thy of reverence: I have loved him; he was en|dowed with qualities that partook of divine.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t moment I &s;aw him, I conceived for him the mo&s;t ardent admiration. He conde|&s;cended
<PB N="217" REF="028752_0445_0FDBDB81EB6E7C08">
to encourage me; I attached my&s;elf to him with all the fulne&s;s of affection. He was un|happy; I exerted my&s;elf with youthful curio&s;ity to di&s;cover the &s;ecret of his woe. This was the beginning of misfortune.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I &s;ay?&mdash;He was indeed the murderer of Tyrrel; he &s;uffered the Hawkinses to be ex|ecuted, knowing that they were innocent, and that he alone was guilty. After &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;urmi&s;es, after various indi&s;cretions on my part and indica|tions on his, he at length confided to me at full the fatal tale!</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland! I mo&s;t &s;olemnly conjure you to recollect your&s;elf! Did I ever prove my&s;elf un|worthy of your confidence? The &s;ecret was a mo&s;t painful burthen to me; it was the extreme&s;t folly that led me unthinkingly to gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; but I would have died a thou&s;and deaths rather than betray it. It was the jealou&s;y of your own thoughts, and the weight that hung upon your mind, that led you to watch my motions, and con|ceive alarm from every particle of my conduct.</P>
<P>You began in confidence; why did you not con|tinue in confidence? The evil that re&s;ulted from my original imprudence, would then have been comparatively little. You threatened me: did I then betray you? A word from my lips at that time would have freed me from your threats for ever. I bore them for a con&s;iderable period, and at la&s;t quitted your &s;ervice, and threw my&s;elf a fugitive upon the world in &s;ilence. Why did you not &s;uffer me to depart? You brought me back by &s;tratagem and violence, and wantonly accu&s;ed me of an enormous felony; did I then mention a &s;yllable of the murder, the &s;ecret of which was in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="028752_0446_0FDBDB836A6CCF30">
Where is the man that has &s;uffered more from the inju&s;tice of &s;ociety than I have done? I was accu&s;ed of a villainy that my heart abhorred. I was &s;ent to jail. I will not enumerate the horrors of my pri&s;on, the lighte&s;t of which would make the heart of humanity &s;hudder. I looked forward to the gallows! Young, ambitious, fond of life, innocent as the child unborn, I looked forward to the gallows! I believed that one word of re&s;olute accu&s;ation again&s;t my ma&s;ter would deliver me, yet I was &s;ilent, I armed my&s;elf with patience, uncertain whether it were better to accu&s;e or to die. Did this &s;hew me a man unworthy to be tru&s;ted?</P>
<P>I determined to break out of pri&s;on. With in|finite difficulty and repeated mi&s;carriages I at length effected my purpo&s;e. In&s;tantly a proclamation with a hundred guineas reward was i&s;&s;ued for ap|prehending me. I was obliged to take refuge among the &s;cum of mankind, in the mid&s;t of a gang of thieves. I encountered the mo&s;t imminent peril of my life when I entered into this retreat, and when I quitted it. Immediately after I tra|velled almo&s;t the whole length of the kingdom in poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, in hourly danger of being re|taken and manacled like a felon. I would have fled my country; I was prevented. I had recour&s;e to various di&s;gui&s;es; I was innocent, and yet was compelled to as many arts and &s;ubterfuges as could have been entailed on the wor&s;t of villains. In London I was as much hara&s;&s;ed and as repeatedly alarmed, as I had been in my flight through the country. Did all the&s;e per&s;ecutions per&s;uade me to put an end to my &s;ilence? No: I &s;uffered them with patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; I did not make one attempt to re|tort them upon their author.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="028752_0447_0FDBDB892E76E5C0">
I fell at la&s;t into the hands of the mi&s;creants that are nouri&s;hed with human blood. In this terrible &s;ituation I for the fir&s;t time attempted by turning informer to throw the weight from my&s;elf. Happily for me the London magi&s;trate li&s;tened to my tale with in&s;olent contempt.</P>
<P>I &s;oon and long repented of my ra&s;hne&s;s and re|joiced in my mi&s;carriage. I acknowledge that in various ways Mr. Falkland &s;hewed humanity to|wards me during this period. He would have pre|vented my going to pri&s;on at fir&s;t; he contributed to my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence during my detention; he had no &s;hare in the pur&s;uit that had been &s;et on foot again&s;t me; he at length procured my di&s;charge when brought forward for trial. But a great part of his forbearance was unknown to me; I &s;uppo&s;ed him to be my unrelenting pur&s;uer. I could not forget that, whoever heaped calamities on me in the &s;equel, they all originated in his forged accu|&s;ation.</P>
<P>The pro&s;ecution again&s;t me for felony was now at an end. Why were not my &s;ufferings permitted to terminate then, and I allowed to hide my weary head in &s;ome ob&s;cure yet tranquil retreat? Had I not &s;ufficiently proved my con&s;tancy and fidelity? Would not a compromi&s;e in this &s;ituation have been mo&s;t wife and mo&s;t &s;ecure? But the re&s;tle&s;s and jealous anxiety of Mr. Falkland would not per|mit him to repo&s;e the lea&s;t atom of confidence. The only compromi&s;e that he propo&s;ed was, that with my own hand I &s;hould &s;ign my&s;elf a villain. I refu&s;ed this propo&s;al, and have ever &s;ince been driven from place to place, deprived of peace, of hone&s;t &s;ame, even of bread. For a long time I per&s;i&s;ted in the re&s;olution that no emergency &s;hould convert me into the a&s;&s;ailant. In evil hour I at la&s;t li&s;tened to my re&s;entment and impatience, and
<PB N="220" REF="028752_0448_0FDBD884A8DF39F0">
the hateful mi&s;take into which I fell has produced the pre&s;ent &s;cene.</P>
<P>I now &s;ee that mi&s;take in all its enormity. I am &s;ure that, if I had opened my heart to Mr. Falkland, if I had told to him privately the tale that I have now been telling, he could not have re|&s;i&s;ted my rea&s;onable demand. After all his pre|cautions, he mu&s;t ultimately have depended upon my forbearance. Could he be &s;ure that, if I were at la&s;t worked up to di&s;clo&s;e every thing I knew, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it with all the energy I could exert, I &s;hould obtain no credit? If he mu&s;t in every ca&s;e be at my mercy, in which mode ought he to have &s;ought his &s;afety, in conciliation or in inexorable cruelty?</P>
<P>Mr. Falkland is of a noble nature. Yes; in &s;pite of the cata&s;trophe of Tyrrel, of the mi&s;era|ble end of the Hawkinses, and of all that I have my&s;elf &s;uffered, I affirm that he has qualities of the mo&s;t admirable kind. It is therefore impo&s;&s;ible that he could have re&s;i&s;ted a frank and fervent ex|po&s;tulation, the frankne&s;s and the fervour in which the whole &s;oul was poured out. I de&s;paired, while it was yet time to have made the ju&s;t experiment; but my de&s;pair was criminal, was trea&s;on again&s;t the &s;overeignty of truth.</P>
<P>I have told a plain and unadulterated tale. I came hither to cur&s;e, but I remain to ble&s;s. I came to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, but am compelled to applaud. I pro|claim to all the world that Mr. Falkland is a man worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> affection and kindne&s;s, and that I am my&s;elf the wor&s;t of villains! Never will I forgive my&s;elf the iniquity of this day. The memory will always haunt me, and embitter every hour of my exi&s;tence. In thus acting I have been a murderer, a cool, deliberate, unfeeling murderer.&mdash;I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> what my accur&s;ed precipitation has obliged me
<PB N="221" REF="028752_0449_0FDBDB8F024183C0">
to &s;ay. Do with me as you plea&s;e! I a&s;k no favour. Death would be a kindne&s;s, compared to what I feel!</P>
<P>Such were the accents dictated by my remor&s;e. I poured them out with uncontroulable impetuo&s;ity, for my heart was pierced, and I was compelled to give vent to its angui&s;h. Every one that heard me was petrified with a&s;toni&s;hment. Every one that heard me was melted into tears. They could not re&s;i&s;t the ardour with which I prai&s;ed the great qualities of Falkland; they manife&s;ted their &s;ym|pathy in the tokens of my penitence.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I de&s;cribe the feelings of this unfor|tunate man? Before I began, he &s;eemed &s;unk and debilitated, incapable of any &s;trenuous impre&s;&s;ion. When I mentioned the murder, I could perceive in him an involuntary &s;huddering, though it was counteracted partly by the feeblene&s;s of his frame, and partly by the energy of his mind. This was an allegation he expected, and he had endeavoured to prepare him&s;elf for it. But there was much of what I &s;aid, of which he had had no previous con|ception. When I expre&s;&s;ed the angui&s;h of my mind, he &s;eemed at fir&s;t &s;tartled and alarmed le&s;t this &s;hould be a new expedient to gain credit to my tale. His indignation again&s;t me was great for having retained all my re&s;entment towards him thus, as it might be, in the la&s;t hour of his ex|i&s;tence. It was increa&s;ed, when he di&s;covered me, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, u&s;ing a pretence of liberality and &s;entiment, to give new edge to my ho&s;tility. But, as I went on, he could no longer re&s;i&s;t. He &s;aw my &s;incerity; he was penetrated with my grief and compunction. He ro&s;e from his &s;eat &s;upported by the attendants, and&mdash;to my infinite a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash;threw him&s;elf into my arms!</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="028752_0450_0FDBDB90ECD6E990">
Williams, &s;aid he, you have conquered! I &s;ee too late the greatne&s;s and elevation of your mind. I adore the qualities that you now di&s;play, though to tho&s;e qualities I owe my ruin. I could have re|&s;i&s;ted any plan of malicious accu&s;ation you might have brought again&s;t me. But I &s;ee that the artle&s;s and manly &s;tory you have told, has carried con|viction to every hearer. All my pro&s;pects are concluded. All that I mo&s;t ardently de&s;ired is for ever fru&s;trated. I have &s;pent a life of the ba&s;e&s;t cruelty to cover one act of momentary vice and to protect my&s;elf again&s;t the prejudices of my &s;pecies. I &s;tand now completely detected. My name will be con&s;ecrated to infamy, while your heroi&s;m, your patience and your virtues will be for ever ad|mired. You have inflicted on me the mo&s;t fatal of all mi&s;chiefs, but I ble&s;s the hand that wounds me. And now,&mdash;turning to the magi&s;trate&mdash;and now, do with me as you plea&s;e. I am prepared to &s;uffer all the vengeance of the law. You cannot inflict on me more than I de&s;erve. You cannot hate me more than I hate my&s;elf. I am the mo&s;t execrable of all villains. I have for years (I know not how long) dragged on a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence in in&s;up|portable pain. I am at la&s;t, in recompen&s;e for all my labours and my crimes, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from it, with the di&s;appointment of my only remaining hope, the de&s;truction of that for the &s;ake of which alone I con&s;ented to exi&s;t. It was worthy of &s;uch a life, that it &s;hould continue ju&s;t long enough to witne&s;s this final overthrow. If however you wi&s;h to puni&s;h me, you mu&s;t be &s;peedy in your ju&s;tice; for, as reputation was the blood that warmed my heart, &s;o I feel that death and infamy mu&s;t &s;eize me together.</P>
<P>I record the prai&s;es be&s;towed on me by Falk|land, not becau&s;e I de&s;erve them, but becau&s;e they
<PB N="223" REF="028752_0451_0FDBDB926869A848">
&s;erve to aggravate the ba&s;ene&s;s of my cruelty. He &s;urvived but three days this dreadful &s;cene. I have been his murderer. It was fit that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> prai&s;e my patience, who has fallen a victim <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and fame, to my precipitation! It would have been merciful in compari&s;on, if I had planted a dagger in his heart! He would have thanked me for my kindne&s;s. But, atrocious, execrable wretch that I have been! I wantonly inflicted on him an angui&s;h a thou&s;and times wor&s;e than death. Mean|while I endure the penalty of my crime. His figure is ever in imagination before me. Waking or &s;leeping I &s;till behold him. He &s;eems mildly to expo&s;tu|late with me for my unfeeling behaviour. I live the devoted victim of con&s;cious reproach. Alas! I am the &s;ame Caleb Williams that but ten days before boa&s;ted, that, however great were the cala|mities I endured, I was &s;till innocent.</P>
<P>Such has been the re&s;ult of a project I formed for delivering my&s;elf from the evils that had &s;o long attended me. I thought that, if Falkland were dead, I &s;hould return once again to all that makes life worth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. I thought that, if the guilt of Falkland were e&s;tabli&s;hed, fortune and the world would &s;mile upon my efforts. Both the&s;e events are accompli&s;hed; and it is only now that I am truly mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould my reflections perpetually centre upon my&s;elf? &s;elf, an overweening regard to which has been the &s;ource of my errors! Falkland, I will think only of thee, and from that thought will draw ever-fre&s;h nouri&s;hment for my &s;orrows! One generous, one di&s;intere&s;ted tear I will con&s;ecrate to thy a&s;hes! A nobler &s;pirit lived not among the &s;ons of men. Thy intellectual powers were truly &s;ublime, and thy bo&s;om burned with a godlike am|bition. But of what u&s;e are talents and &s;entiments

in the corrupt wilderne&s;s of human &s;ociety? It is a rank and rotten &s;oil from which every finer &s;hrub draws poi&s;on as it grows. All that in a happier field and a purer air would expand into virtue and germinate into general u&s;efulne&s;s, is thus converted into henbane and deadly night&s;hade.</P>
<P>Falkland! thou &s;etted&s;t out in thy career with the pure&s;t and mo&s;t laudable intentions. But thou imbibed&s;t the poi&s;on of chivalry with thy earlie&s;t youth&punc; and the ba&s;e and low-minded envy that met thee on thy return to thy native &s;eats, operated with this poi&s;on to hurry thee into madne&s;s. Soon, too &s;oon, by this fatal coincidence were the bloom|ing hopes of thy youth bla&s;ted for ever! From that moment thou only continued&s;t to live to the phan|tom of departed honour.

<P>I began the&s;e memoirs with the idea of vindi|cating my own character.
