<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ST. PAUL's</HI> Epi&s;tle to the <HI>ROMANS, Chap. XIII. Ver&s;es 1&s;t &amp; 2d.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Let every Soul be &s;ubject unto the higher Powers; for there is no Power but of God; the Powers that be, are ordained of God.</P>
<P>Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the Power, re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of God; and they that re&s;i&s;t, &s;hall receive to them&s;elves Damnation.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I AM per&s;uaded, that every one who feels the lea&s;t regard for the wellfare and happine&s;s of his country; and the peace and comfort of his fellow-&s;ubjects and countrymen, will look upon the &s;ubject as highly proper, and &s;ea&s;onable at this time.</P>
<P>FOR who can reflect upon &s;o many wretched and unthinking men, thus madly attempting to &s;ubvert the laws of the kingdom; thus incon&s;iderately involving friends, relations and neighbours, in the mo&s;t direful calamity, and fooli&s;hly bringing upon them&s;elves de|&s;truction here, and damnation hereafter:&mdash;who can look upon &s;o deplorable a &s;eene, without feeling the mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ires, that every &s;uch ra&s;h and mi&s;guided per&s;on could be made duly &s;en&s;ible of the dreadful impiety of &s;o daring and wicked an action, as well as of the certain mi&s;ery that mu&s;t inevitably be the con&s;equence?</P>
<P>IT is po&s;&s;ible this alarming con&s;ideration may prevail with &s;ome per&s;ons, when every other more laudable motive fails of its proper influence; and, it is to be hoped, that a &s;ight of their danger may bring them to a &s;en&s;e of their duty.</P>
<P>WITH this view, I have &s;ingled out the words of the text for the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent meditation: And though I have the plea|&s;ure to think I am &s;peaking before tho&s;e who &s;tand not in need of
<PB N="2" REF="010977_0005_0F8530DF26EF9720">
the admonition they contain, yet I thought it not improper for us to con&s;ider the &s;everal arguments which enforce this great duty here enjoined; that we may not only be pre&s;erv'd &s;tedfa&s;t in our obe|dience to it our&s;elves, but may be able to convince others of the danger, as well as error of their ways; and keep them, for the fu|ture, in the paths of duty and allegiance, from which they have lately &s;o unhappily wandered.</P>
<P>YOU cannot but ob&s;erve then, in the fir&s;t place, that this impor|tant duty of &s;ubjection to lawful authority, is one plain and prin|cipal doctrine of chri&s;tianity. It is here delivered to the world by an in&s;pired Apo&s;tle of CHRIST; by <HI>Him,</HI> whom our LORD, in a vi&s;ion to <HI>Ananias,</HI> honours with the di&s;tingui&s;hing title of <HI>"a cho|&s;en ve&s;&s;el to Him&s;elf."</HI> He it is, who, thus commi&s;&s;ioned from above, gives us, in the name of the mo&s;t high GOD, this &s;olemn command in the words of the text; to which we are, all of us, both high and low, rich and poor, wi&s;e and ignorant, indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to pay the highe&s;t reverence and regard; and no rank nor &s;tation in life, can po&s;&s;ibly exempt any one from the &s;tricte&s;t obe|dience to it: For it is directed to all men in general, without any exception&mdash;<HI>Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject to the higher powers</HI>&mdash;and it comes to us by the <HI>Authority</HI> of the &s;ame GOD and SAVIOUR, who has given us every other precept that we meet with in holy &s;cripture:&mdash;It comes to us from that &s;overeign LORD OF ALL LORDS, who&s;e name we have the honour to bear; who&s;e &s;ubjects we profe&s;s our&s;elves at pre&s;ent; and who&s;e eternal kingdom we hope to become inheritors of hereafter: 'Till men, therefore, have renounced CHRIST, and apo&s;tatized from <HI>his</HI> religion&mdash;'till they have di&s;owned <HI>his</HI> &s;overeignty and dominion over them, and given up all expectations of future happine&s;s from his favour, they mu&s;t ac|knowledge them&s;elves bound, by the &s;tronge&s;t ties, both of intere&s;t and gratitude, to comply with this &s;acred injunction, no le&s;s than with every other command of <HI>his Divine Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>BUT we may &s;till further judge of the &s;ingular importance of this duty enjoined us in the text, from that remarkable &s;tre&s;s laid upon
<PB N="3" REF="010977_0006_0F8530E027840338">
it by the great Apo&s;tle in &s;everal other of his Epi&s;tles. When he is delivering his apo&s;tolical injunctions to <HI>Titus,</HI> and in&s;tructing him in the &s;everal branches of his duty as a mini&s;ter of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> he gives it him in charge, in a very &s;olemn manner, to put men in mind, to be &s;ubject to principalities and powers; to obey <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI>; to &s;peak evil of <HI>no man</HI>; to be no <HI>brawlers,</HI> but <HI>gentle</HI>; &s;hewing all <HI>meekne&s;s</HI> to <HI>all men.</HI> The&s;e things, &s;ays he, I will that thou affirm con&s;tantly, that they which have believed in God, that is, they who have acknowledged the truth of that revelation <HI>he</HI> has made us in the Go&s;pel, might be careful to maintain good works: The&s;e things are good and profitable unto men.</P>
<P>AND in the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to <HI>Timothy,</HI> he carries this reque&s;t and reverence for the powers that are lawfully &s;et over us, to a &s;till grea|ter height; making it our duty, not only to be &s;ubject unto them, but to implore the favour of Heaven upon them, and the divine ble&s;&s;ing on their endeavours for the public happine&s;s and tranquility. <HI>I exhort fir&s;t of all,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>that Supplications, Prayers, Interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of Thanks, be made for all Men: For Kings, and for all that are in Authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty; for this is good, and acceptable in the &s;ight of God our Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>JUDGE therefore in your&s;elves, my beloved brethren, and be&s;eech others, in the name of God, to con&s;ider how dreadful a breach of this duty they mu&s;t be guilty of, who, in&s;tead of praying for the &s;afety of our governors and protectors, pre&s;ume to threaten their &s;acred per&s;ons with violence, to whom God has commanded us to pay the highe&s;t veneration, becau&s;e they derive their authority from <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>AND this leads me to a &s;econd very material argument, ari&s;ing from the words of the text, which &s;trongly enforces this duty, and to which it becomes every one &s;eriou&s;ly to attend: For &s;urely no|thing &s;hould more fully convince us of our obligation to pay the mo&s;t ready obedience to this precept of chri&s;tianity, than the &s;olemn rea&s;on which the Apo&s;tle has immediately &s;ubjoined: <HI>Let every &s;oul
<PB N="4" REF="010977_0007_0F8530E05ADB9470">
be &s;ubject to the higer powers; for there is no power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI></P>
<P>HAD this precept been delivered to mankind without pointing out to them at the &s;ame time, this particularly awful &s;anction; yet even then our ob&s;ervance of it would have remained indi&s;pen&s;ible: For when God commands, man is to obey.</P>
<P>THAT God, from <HI>whom</HI> we have received life and breath, and all things, and to <HI>whom</HI> we are indebted for every comfort and ble&s;&s;ing we enjoy&mdash;that God, upon <HI>whom alone</HI> we are to depend to all eternity, and by <HI>whom</HI> our unalterable fate is to be finally de|termined;&mdash;this great and adorable BEING has an uncontroula|ble right over <HI>his</HI> dependent creatures, to lay upon them whatever commands <HI>his</HI> wi&s;dom &s;ees proper for them, without being obliged to &s;atisfy them of the rea&s;ons for &s;uch his &s;overeign will and plea&s;ure. But in the ca&s;e before us, you cannot but take notice, in how very different a manner God has been plea&s;ed to deal with us; for while he gives us this command by his holy Apo&s;tle, he graciou&s;ly con|de&s;cends to inform us of tho&s;e weighty rea&s;ons upon which the duty is founded, and which would be mo&s;t likely to engage us in a re|ligious ob&s;ervance of it.</P>
<P>WE are commanded, therefore, <HI>to be &s;ubject to the higher powers,</HI> becau&s;e the authority they are inve&s;ted with is from HEAVEN: <HI>The powers that be, are ordained of God!</HI>&mdash;They are God's vicegerents upon earth, and in&s;truments in the hand of his providence, for car|rying on the grand purpo&s;es of protection and government, and for &s;ecuring the peace and happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>AND though, indeed, they are &s;ometimes unhappily obliged, through the perver&s;ene&s;s and wickedne&s;s that is in the world, to be|come <HI>unwilling</HI> avengers, to execute wrath upon every one that doth evil; yet are they, in general, the mini&s;ters of God to us, for good, and for the prai&s;e and reward of them that do well.</P>
<P>WAS it not for this nece&s;&s;ary power which has been committed to them by the ALMIGHTY, every thing mu&s;t &s;oon be involved in the mo&s;t dreadful anarchy and confu&s;ion. Every man's own will
<PB N="5" REF="010977_0008_0F8530E10DAACB68">
would then be his law; and no language can fully de&s;cribe tho&s;e various &s;cenes of mi&s;ery and horror which would continually ari&s;e before us, from the di&s;cordant pa&s;&s;ions and divided intere&s;ts of man|kind. But God, in his infinite goodne&s;s, has provided a natural &s;ecurity again&s;t all the&s;e mi&s;chiefs in tho&s;e different ranks and or|ders of men, which his wi&s;dom has thought proper &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the world; and in which &s;ome are allotted to govern, and others obliged to obey, that &s;o the happine&s;s of the whole community might the more effectually be pre&s;erved. And upon the&s;e <HI>guardians</HI> of the public and general wellfare, God has been plea&s;ed to confer a divine authority, to render their per&s;ons, as well as ordinances, the more &s;acred and venerable.</P>
<P>IT is by <HI>him,</HI> therefore, that kings reign, and princes decree ju&s;tice; by <HI>him</HI> princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth: And as it is very beautifully expre&s;&s;ed in the book of Wi&s;|dom, <HI>power</HI> is given them of the LORD, and <HI>&s;overeignty</HI> from the <HI>Highe&s;t:</HI> To the truth of this important point, we have a greater than <HI>Solomon</HI> bearing te&s;timony; even our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf; <HI>who,</HI> when <HI>Pilate</HI> was boa&s;ting of that power he had over <HI>him,</HI> ei|ther to crucify or to relea&s;e <HI>him,</HI> puts him in mind from whence he had received his authority; and gives him this mild and in&s;tructive an&s;wer, <HI>Thou could&s;t have no power at all again&s;t me, except it were given thee from above.</HI></P>
<P>HERE we learn from the mouth of our <HI>Redeemer him&s;elf,</HI> whence is derived that dignity and &s;acredne&s;s, which belongs to tho&s;e who are inve&s;ted with any public power and office.&mdash;Here we behold the God of the univer&s;e &s;ubmitting to that &s;upreme authority <HI>he him&s;elf</HI> has conferred upon man; and acknowledging the reverence due to that very power, which was &s;hortly to pronounce the &s;entence of death again&s;t <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>BUT we have a &s;till more &s;triking and remarkable in&s;tance of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion and re&s;pect to the <HI>Civil Powers,</HI> which our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, upon another occa&s;ion, conde&s;cended to &s;hew, and which highly de&s;erves every one's &s;erious attention and regard: It is recorded by the
<PB N="6" REF="010977_0009_0F8530E1D3DE22C8">
Evangeli&s;t St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> in the 17th chapter of his Go&s;pel, that when our Lord was come to <HI>Capernaum,</HI> they who received the tri|bute money, which was required of every Jew above the age of twenty, demanded of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> whether his <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> intended to pay it. St. <HI>Peter</HI> very readily engages for his Lord's willing and chear|ful compliance; as he well knew how exact had ever been <HI>his</HI> ob|&s;ervance of every civil, as well as religious duty: But when he came into the hou&s;e to inform his ma&s;ter of this demand, our <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour,</HI> by an ea&s;y &s;imilitude, leads him to under&s;tand, that he had been too ha&s;ty in his promi&s;es for <HI>him</HI>; for &s;urely, if the children of earthly princes could plead a freedom from paying any cu&s;tom or tribute, (as appeared by his own reply to the que&s;tion our Lord had propo&s;ed) much more rea&s;onably might <HI>he</HI> be exempted from it, who was <HI>him&s;elf</HI> the <HI>Lord of all things,</HI> and the <HI>Son</HI> of that hea|venly <HI>King,</HI> for the &s;ervice of <HI>who&s;e</HI> temple this particular tribute was paid.&mdash;But notwith&s;tanding our Lord might have ju&s;tly claimed this privilege and exemption; yet, you &s;ee, <HI>he</HI> willingly declines it; and, <HI>Lea&s;t we &s;hould offend them,</HI> &s;ays <HI>he</HI> to the Apo&s;tle, <HI>go thou to the &s;ea, and ca&s;t an hook, and take up the fi&s;h that fir&s;t cometh up; and when thou ha&s;t opened his mouth, thou &s;hall find a piece of money; that take, and give unto them for me and for thee.</HI>&mdash;What conde&s;cen|&s;ion was this in the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God!</HI>&mdash;Who but mu&s;t be &s;truck with admiration at this amazing in&s;tance of <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> in thus vouch|&s;afing to work a miracle, rather than not &s;atisfy the demands of public authority; le&s;t, by refu&s;ing compliance <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> he might countenance others in di&s;obedience and rebellion! And who is there that will pre&s;ume to offer in&s;ult to the powers that are in authority, or &s;hew the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, when he con&s;iders how remarkably our Lord was plea&s;ed to honour them, by expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t cautious fear of di&s;plea&s;ing them, and thus wonderfully providing again&s;t giving any offence?&mdash;In order, therefore, to guard men from in|curring the guilt of &s;o heinous a crime, let us, in the third place, briefly con&s;ider the dreadful conquences that mu&s;t attend it.&mdash;This the Apo&s;tle gives us, in the&s;e few, but awful words, <HI>They that
<PB N="7" REF="010977_0010_0F8530E291579EF8">
re&s;i&s;t, &s;hall receive to them&s;elves</HI> DAMNATION; not only condemna|tion in this <HI>world,</HI> but <HI>eternal vengeance</HI> in the <HI>life</HI> to <HI>come.</HI>&mdash;And here again, we cannot but ob&s;erve, the great importance of this duty of &s;ubjection, from that tender care which the goodne&s;s of GOD has taken to &s;ecure our obedience to it. Some precepts are delivered to us without any particular intimation of the puni&s;hment attending our neglect: But this was a matter of &s;o much con|&s;equence to the general comfort and happine&s;s of the world, that the <HI>divine wi&s;dom</HI> thought it nece&s;&s;ary for us, while we read the &s;a|cred injunction, to have before our eyes that future mi&s;ery which mu&s;t follow the violation of it: So that, if the love of God, and reverence for <HI>his</HI> commands, &s;hould fail to produce this becoming &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, a regard for our own <HI>Everla&s;ting Intere&s;t</HI> might po&s;&s;ibly prevail.</P>
<P>GOD has, therefore, been plea&s;ed, by <HI>his</HI> holy Apo&s;tle, to pro|nounce the &s;entence of <HI>inevitable perdition upon all tho&s;e who re|fu&s;e &s;ubjection to lawful power and authority</HI>; as hereby, they not only &s;hew the highe&s;t contempt of <HI>his</HI> po&s;itive command, but do all in their power to ob&s;truct the gracious de&s;ings of <HI>his</HI> providence, for the <HI>good</HI> and <HI>wellfare</HI> of <HI>mankind.</HI> So that, upon calm con&s;ide|ration, every one mu&s;t acknowledge, there cannot po&s;&s;ibly be of|fered a greater in&s;ult to <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD, than thus contemptuou&s;ly to di&s;regard <HI>his</HI> will, and di&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e &s;acred powers whom <HI>he</HI> has ordained and appointed to carry on the be&s;t and noble&s;t purpo&s;es in the world: And what wonder then is it that &s;o terrible a portion is re&s;erved in &s;tore for every &s;uch bold and pre&s;umptuous offender?&mdash;GOD is repre&s;ented in &s;cripture as the <HI>God</HI> of <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>Lover</HI> of <HI>Con|cord</HI>; and we are, for this rea&s;on, commanded, in another place, to follow peace with <HI>all men</HI>; becau&s;e, without this, no man &s;hall &s;ee the LORD. Every one, therefore, &s;hall hereafter be bani&s;hed from <HI>his</HI> pre&s;ence and glory who dares to di&s;turb, in the lea&s;t de|gree, that peace and harmony; or endeavours, in any re&s;pect, to de&s;troy that good order and government, which it is the intention of HEAVEN &s;hould be &s;upported in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="010977_0011_0F8530E35061C190">BUT though we were not able to a&s;&s;ign any particular rea&s;on for this &s;evere judgment mentioned in the text, yet ought it to be a &s;ufficient warning to every rebellious &s;inner, to find how po&s;itively it is there denounced: For what God has &s;o &s;olemnly threatened, <HI>he</HI> will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly inflict.</P>
<P>THESE then are the principal rea&s;ons which enforce the duty en|joined by the Apo&s;tle; but there are &s;everal others, which, if duly attended to, cannot but add con&s;iderable weight to the arguments already offered, and which I &s;hall, therefore, beg leave briefly to mention.</P>
<P>LET it be con&s;idered then, that re&s;i&s;tance to that lawful power and authority which God hath &s;et over us, can never po&s;&s;ibly be productive of any thing but the wilde&s;t uproar, and mo&s;t univer&s;al confu&s;ion; and, in the end, can never fail of being attended with the mo&s;t &s;hocking and di&s;mal effects.</P>
<P>OF this we would have &s;een a dreadful and melancholly proof; and God only knows what wor&s;e con&s;equences might have en&s;ued, had they not been happily prevented by the good conduct of tho&s;e brave men, who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves as remarkably by their HUMANITY, as by the VALOUR, they &s;hewed on that trying oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>To their courage and intrepidity will ever be due our warme&s;t gratitude and thanks; which, ble&s;&s;ed be God, gave &s;o timely a check to the de&s;perate fury of tho&s;e ra&s;h men who were engaged in that execrable attempt; and to their humanity the&s;e very men mu&s;t ever acknowledge them&s;elves obliged, which bore &s;o long and pa|tiently their repeated and exa&s;perating in&s;ults, and treated them after|wards with greater lenity than they could rea&s;onably expect; for where one has not fallen, twenty ought to have &s;uffered.</P>
<P>LET every one learn, that outrage and violence can never an&s;wer any other end but to &s;pread &s;laughter and de&s;olation around us; and to introduce the mo&s;t wretched &s;cenes of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s: Let them con&s;ider further, how impo&s;&s;ible it is that any good can ever be brought about by &s;uch wicked means; and that tho' &s;ome
<PB N="9" REF="010977_0012_0F8530E40FBD76F8">
may only meet the ruin their ra&s;hne&s;s has &s;ought, yet many others mu&s;t unavoidably become partakers in the calamity, who were ne|ver partners in the crime.</P>
<P>THE con&s;ideration therefore of the pre&s;ent misfortunes, in which many of their fellow-creatures mu&s;t be involved, as well as the fu|ture de&s;truction to which others are expo&s;ed by &s;uch daring acts of rebellion, will naturally re&s;train every man from uniting in them who has the lea&s;t &s;park of humanity and compa&s;&s;ion remaining in his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>ANOTHER motive which cannot but have great weight with eve|ry generous mind, is the reflection that every the lea&s;t In&s;ult offer|ed to magi&s;trates and governors, is an act of the ba&s;e&s;t ingratitude again&s;t tho&s;e who are, under god, our protectors and guardians, not only from foreign Enemies, but from every dome&s;tic foe: To them we owe our &s;ecurity from all that numerous train of mi&s;chiefs to which we &s;hould be daily liable, from the corruption and wick|edne&s;s of the world, if under no re&s;traint from human laws, and and unawed by by proper authority!&mdash;To them are we indebted for the &s;afe and comfortable enjoyment of all the ble&s;&s;ings of private life, and all the advantages we derive from civil &s;ociety!&mdash;Were there not &s;ome who would take upon them the arduous bu&s;ine&s;s of public government, the execution of laws, and admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, how would vice and iniquity every where triumph! And what mu&s;t become of the welfare and tranquility of every individual, were men left at full liberty to plan their malicious &s;chemes again&s;t them, and knew they could &s;afely execute them whenever they plea&s;ed? What mu&s;t become of the general peace and happine&s;s of the whole community, when fraud and inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion and violence, with every other crime that is injurious to &s;ociety, might be perpetrated with impunity, and without controul? How infi|nitely then are we obliged to tho&s;e per&s;ons who willingly undertake &s;o important a tru&s;t, and by who&s;e care, abilities and vigilance, the&s;e evils are prevented, and the public felicity pre&s;erved? And how very
<PB N="10" REF="010977_0013_0F8530E60BDCBA58">
enormous and &s;hocking is the offence, when in the di&s;charge of their laborious office, they are treated with in&s;olence in&s;tead of honour, and meet with threatnings in&s;tead of thanks!</P>
<P>BUT la&s;tly, there is one remark I have further to make, and which ought to have a peculiar force with the people of this land, in leading them chearfully to that &s;ubjection which is repre&s;ented in the text, as the common duty of all men.&mdash;I would beg leave to ob&s;erve therefore, that for an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> to oppo&s;e the laws of his country, is an in&s;tance of the highe&s;t folly and contradiction we can conceive: For &s;uch is the &s;ingular excellence of our happy con&s;ti|tution, that the laws to which our obedience is required, are, in reality, no other than what we our&s;elves have been partly concerned in making.</P>
<P>ALL men mu&s;t know, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for a whole province to meet together for this important work; and every one, I be|lieve, will acknowledge, that were they &s;o a&s;&s;embled, very few would be found capable of carrying it on: For as the wi&s;e &s;on of <HI>Sirac</HI> very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <HI>How can he get wi&s;dom that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the goad; that driveth oxen, and is occupied in their labours; and who&s;e talk is of bullocks? They &s;hall not be &s;ought for in the public council; nor &s;it high in the congregation; they cannot &s;it in the judges &s;eat, nor under&s;tand the &s;entence of judg|ment:</HI> Since therefore, we cannot all be pre&s;ent in this great a&s;&s;em|bly, wherein the weighty bu&s;ine&s;s of public government is tran&s;acted, we have this peculiar privilege, <HI>and a glorious one it is,</HI> of appoint|ing &s;uch per&s;ons, in who&s;e abilities, under&s;tanding, and integrity, we think we may &s;afely confide, to appear for us, in that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly; and who are, upon that account, very properly &s;tiled <HI>our repre&s;entatives.</HI></P>
<P>IN con&s;equence then of this choice, which we have the liberty to make, and that full power we voluntarily give into their hands; we not only yield our con&s;ent before-hand, to whatever laws they may judge it expedient to enact, but may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to have had
<PB N="11" REF="010977_0014_0F8530E691B7DF98">
a principal &s;hare in enacting them our&s;elves; ina&s;much as they are framed by their wi&s;dom, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by their authority, whom we have appointed for that very purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>So that every man, of the mo&s;t common under&s;tanding, if he will allow him&s;elf a moment's reflection, may ea&s;ily &s;ee how par|ticularly it is the duty of every one of us, to &s;ubmit to the laws of his land; and, how a&s;toni&s;hining an ab&s;urdity it mu&s;t appear to all the world, if ever we refu&s;e that becoming &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>How happy would millions think them&s;elves at this hour, who know no other law than the imperious will of &s;ome arbitrary prince, could they change &s;ituations with us, and ta&s;te the &s;ingular ble&s;&s;ing we enjoy, in being govern'd by the laws we our&s;elves have made! Let us take care, we &s;et a due value upon this ine&s;timable privilege; le&s;t, if we &s;light the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of God's fa|vour, and di&s;turb that excellent form of government which his pro|vidence has &s;o long pre&s;erved among us,&mdash;<HI>He</HI> may be provoked to deprive us of it, and bring upon us the mi&s;ery which &s;uch ingrati|tude would de&s;erve.</P>
<P>I SHALL now briefly &s;um up what has been &s;aid in this di&s;cour&s;e, that we may &s;ee how many, and powerful, are the arguments we are furni&s;hed with, to engage us in a &s;tedfa&s;t ob&s;ervance of this duty, and enable us to convince others of their indi&s;pen&s;ible obligations to practice it.</P>
<P>YOU find, then, it is a duty which is guarded from viola|tion by all the mo&s;t &s;acred and awful &s;anctions that could po&s;&s;ibly be thought of; and bound upon us, by every tie, civil, moral, and divine.&mdash;The peace and tranquility of our fellow-&s;ubjects and coun|trymen demand our obedience to it.&mdash;The well-being and happine&s;s of &s;ociety in general, and the comfort and felicity of our dear rela|tions, friends and neighbours in particular, depend upon it; and without our con&s;cientious performance of it, an univer&s;al &s;cene of confu&s;ion mu&s;t &s;oon prevail, and all be involved together in the deepe&s;t calamity and horror.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="010977_0015_0F8530E7443193F0">LET all &s;uch per&s;ons therefore who dare to think of engaging in any act of rebellion and di&s;obedience, be intreated to contemplate a little tho&s;e various and horrible mi&s;eries they will unavoidably oc|ca&s;ion, and that may po&s;&s;ibly deter them from it:&mdash;Let them li&s;ten to the cries of the di&s;conlate widow;&mdash;behold the tears of the helple&s;s orphan; and con&s;ider, how they will be able to endure the &s;ad upbraidings of tho&s;e mi&s;erable mourners, who may ju&s;tly take up again&s;t them the lamentation of the prophet <HI>Jeremiah: Is it nothing to you, all ye that pa&s;s by? behold, and &s;ee if there be any &s;orrow like unto our &s;orrow, which your ra&s;hne&s;s and iniquity have brought upon us!</HI></P>
<P>BUT particularly let them remember, that the blood which may be &s;hed by their means, will hereafter be required at their hands; and that every one of tho&s;e unhappy &s;ouls who &s;hall be brought to an untimely end through their evil coun&s;els and wicked in&s;tigations, and &s;ent into another world with all their &s;ins about them, will ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t them at the la&s;t day, and call for tenfold vengeance on their devoted heads.</P>
<P>LET them be farther put in mind, that gratitude to tho&s;e who afford us a peaceful &s;ecurity from every ill, &s;hould engage us in a &s;teady adherence to this duty, at all times and upon every occa&s;ion: Should lead us to return obedience for protection, and repay the kind exertion of their abilities and endeavours for the public happi|ne&s;s, with the ea&s;y tribute of reverence and affection.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ome men may have neither humanity nor genero&s;ity enough in their tempers, to be affected by &s;uch con&s;iderations as the&s;e. To them therefore we mu&s;t open the &s;acred page, (which, perhaps, they have never before looked into) and point out the &s;olemn and po&s;i|tive command of God enforcing this great duty; and tho' they may not regard an earthly potentate, yet &s;urely they will &s;tand in awe of the MAJESTY of HEAVEN: Or, as holy <HI>Job</HI> emphatically puts the que&s;tion; <HI>Shall not HIS EXCELLENCY make them afraid? and &s;hall not His DREAD fall uopn them?</HI>&mdash;Shew them, moreover,
<PB N="13" REF="010977_0016_0F8530E7CE8767F8">
the foundation upon which the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this duty is &s;upport|ed: Tell them, that obedience to the civil powers is required of us, not only becau&s;e God has commanded it, but given us al&s;o this very &s;olemn rea&s;on, enforcing that command;&mdash;that they were in&s;tituted and ordained by Him&s;elf. When they read therefore, that there is no power but of God, be&s;eech them &s;eriou&s;ly to con|&s;ider how dete&s;table they mu&s;t render them&s;elves in His &s;ight, who, in&s;tead of &s;ummitting to every ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake, (as we are taught by another Apo&s;tle, is our bounden duty) dare to ri&s;e up them&s;elves, and compel others to unite with them, in oppo&s;ition to any law that has been legally e&s;tabli&s;hed; or to ob|&s;truct the mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice in the execution of that high office they are obliged by oath to di&s;charge, and which has been derived to them from the authority of the <HI>Almighty</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>NOTHING, one would think, could &s;o effectually &s;trengthen our ob|ligation to the duty of &s;ubjection, as this &s;ingle con&s;ideration, that who&s;oever re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God; and that every &s;uch wicked and de&s;perate attempt is not only trea&s;on a|gain&s;t an earthly &s;overeign, but rebellion again&s;t the mo&s;t high God.</P>
<P>AS a farther motive to this duty, and becau&s;e example is more prevailing than precept, bid them turn their eyes upon the meek and ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, and behold him in that gracious and conde&s;cend|ing act of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, I mentioned in the former part of this di&s;|cour&s;e.&mdash;Ask them, if they are not &s;en&s;ible, that He who could feed five thou&s;and men with a few loaves and fi&s;hes, could have &s;upported millions with the &s;ame ea&s;e, to have protected him from the re&s;entment of the civil powers, if he had thought fit to have made the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition? but in&s;tead of &s;hewing re&s;i&s;tance, we behold Him here manife&s;ting the mo&s;t tender concern and regard for the &s;upport of their authority; and by that miraculous method he took to pay obedience to it, convincing mankind of the nece&s;|&s;ity and importance of this great duty.</P>
<P>SHALL man then pre&s;ume to refu&s;e that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which God him&s;elf has thus conde&s;cended to pay? This aimiable pattern we
<PB N="14" REF="010977_0017_0F8530EAB196EA70" MS="y">
have before us in the per&s;on of our great <HI>Redeemer,</HI> ought to have an irre&s;i&s;table influence upon all who call them&s;elves by <HI>his</HI> name; and was, no doubt, intended for our imitation by that gracious Be|ing, who came from HEAVEN with this peculiar de&s;ign, to leave us an example that we might follow his &s;teps.</P>
<P>FINALLY, whereas the more various and powerful the motives are, which enforce any duty, &s;o much more aggrevated will be the crime which leads us to break through them: Oh! be&s;eech them therefore, in the pathetic words of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> to repent of this their wickedne&s;s; and pray God, if perhaps the thought of their heart may be forgiven them. This repentance and contrition, if accom|panied with future obedience, may not only procure them pardon at an earthly tribunal, but when they come to &s;tand before the judg|ment &s;eat of CHRIST, will be one means of their obtaining mercy from the Lord in that day, and e&s;caping the vengeance which will otherwi&s;e fall upon them. And this leads me to the la&s;t motive we have, to enforce their ob&s;ervance of this chri&s;tian duty enjoined in the text; the con&s;ideration of that eternal mi&s;ery denounced again&s;t tho&s;e who neglect it.</P>
<P>IF men have no love for their country; if they have no regard for the peace and happine&s;s of tho&s;e around them; if they have neither humanity nor compa&s;&s;ion; neither gratitude nor genero&s;ity in their brea&s;ts; if they have no veneration for their king, nor reverence for the be&s;t con&s;titution in the world; yet they mu&s;t have &s;ome affec|tion for them&s;elves: And though they may di&s;pi&s;e the commands of GOD, and the example of a SAVIOUR, yet they cannot di&s;regard their own everla&s;ting wellfare. This motive then may po&s;&s;ibly bring them to repentence, and a better mind, when every other has failed of its influence; and let us not omit ince&s;&s;antly, and importunately, to urge it upon them.</P>
<P>WARN them of the certain perdition they mu&s;t inevitably bring upon them&s;elves; and exhort them to con&s;ider in time, how fearful a thing it is to fall into the hands of the LIVING GOD! Tell them our God is a con&s;uming fire to &s;uch workers of iniquity, and able
<PB N="15" REF="010977_0018_0F8530EAD4FBBC10" MS="y">
to de&s;troy both body and &s;oul for ever; and bid them therefore re|member, that though they may e&s;cape from the &s;word of ju&s;tice in this life, they cannot e&s;cape the DAMNATION OF HELL.</P>
<P>MAY the good grace of God pre&s;erve us at all times from falling into the like crime, that we may never incur &s;o dreadful a condem|nation. And as we of this land are peculiarly ble&s;&s;ed at this time with one of the mo&s;t aimiable and excellent Governors that ever adorned a province, who has given us his <HI>promi&s;e,</HI> that the felicity of his people &s;hall ever be his principal care; let it be our perpetual &s;tudy and delight, by every means in our power, and particularly by all dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to <HI>him,</HI> and <HI>tho&s;e</HI> whom <HI>he</HI> &s;hall &s;et over us, to render <HI>his</HI> government as peaceful and happy to our affectionate SOVEREIGN, as he will endeavour to make it to us his grateful &s;ub|jects.</P>
<P>SO &s;hall we &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven on our&s;elves and our po&s;terity; and whenever we are removed out of this trouble&s;ome world, &s;hall become members of that ble&s;&s;ed kingdom, where uni|ver&s;al peace and love, and uninterrupted concord and harmony, will reign for ever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
