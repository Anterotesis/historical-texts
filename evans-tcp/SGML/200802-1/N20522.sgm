<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>IF this a&s;&s;embly were convened, for the pur|po&s;e of li&s;tening to a di&s;&s;ertation on the gen|eral &s;ubjects of freedom and &s;lavery, the fact would appear &s;ingular, in the view of a &s;tranger. For certainly, a nation, which has led the re&s;t of the world to the con&s;ideration of the&s;e mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting topics, and fully di&s;clo&s;ed the nature of the latter, ought to furni&s;h no employment for the advocate of the former. And if any thing can &s;ound like a &s;oleci&s;m in the ears of mankind, it will be this &s;tory&mdash;That in the United States of America, &s;ocieties are formed for the promo|tion of freedom. Will not the enquiry in&s;tantly be made&mdash;"Are the United States of America not free? Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the be&s;t country, the wi&s;e&s;t gov|ernment, and the mo&s;t virtuous inhabitants, on the face of the earth; are they &s;till en&s;laved?" No&mdash;America is not en&s;laved; &s;he is free. Her country is &s;till excellent, her government wife, and her inhabitants virtuous. But this reply mu&s;t be mixed with one ba&s;e ingredient. The &s;lavery of negroes is &s;till &s;uffered to exi&s;t. The an&s;wer being given, the a&s;toni&s;hment will imme|diately

cea&s;e, and the enquiry become cool and &s;piritle&s;&s;. Whether negroes are en&s;laved, or free; mi&s;erable, or happy; are que&s;tions not intere&s;ting to their whiter ma&s;ters. Placed by Providence in a more fortunate &s;ituation, and im|pelled by that love of domination, which is in|herent in man, they become much more active in &s;ecuring the &s;ubjects of their tyranny, than in the exten&s;ion of human happine&s;s. Nor is this all. Such is the depravity of our nature and the force of habit, that Rea&s;on is too often called in to aid the dictates of Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;anction the cruelties of Tyranny,</P>
<P>THE exi&s;tence of African &s;lavery then even in the &s;tate of Connecticut, being a fact which ad|mits not of contradiction, the propriety of In&s;ti|tutions like that, which has brought this audi|ence together, will &s;ufficiently appear. Nor will the frequent recurrence of this meeting, in the &s;malle&s;t degree le&s;&s;en the importance of its duty. For tho' to the ear of cold and nervele&s;s Apathy, the frequent detail of iniquities &s;teadily commit|ted, and of duties too often neglected, may be a tedious and painful talk; yet the benevolent heart can never be unintere&s;ted, when li&s;tening to a rehear&s;al of the wretchedne&s;s of man, or when contemplating the pro&s;pect of his encrea|&s;ing felicity.</P>
<P>THERE is not a point of view, in which Afri|can &s;lavery has not been con&s;idered by men of the fir&s;t talents for re&s;earch, for detail, and for de|&s;cription. The labours of the poet, the hi&s;tori|an, the legi&s;lator, and the divine, have often pre|&s;ented the &s;ubject in the &s;tronge&s;t, and mo&s;t odi|ous colours. Still the evil exi&s;ts; and Intere&s;t
<PB N="5" REF="026922_0004_0FD2642A45F36830">
alone has been able to with&s;tand the united force of imagination, of eloquence, of truth, and of religion. I &s;ay Intere&s;t alone; for I will ven|ture to a&s;&s;ert, that when it &s;hall cea&s;e to be for the intere&s;t of mankind, to torture their fellow creatures in this wicked commerce, not one &s;oli|tary individual will be found trafficking in human fle&s;h. Tho&s;e commands of the Deity, which are now impious&s;ly appealed to, as a &s;anction for barbarity and murder, will then be pa&s;&s;ed by un|regarded; and the&s;e defencele&s;s objects of cru|elty, will be left in the quiet enjoyment of their native &s;implicity, innocence, and happine&s;s. Where is the zealous apo&s;tle of truth, who, be|lieving it to be the will of the compa&s;&s;ionate God, that every being, among his creatures, who wears a fable complexion, &s;hould be redu|ced to the mo&s;t abject &s;ervitude, would ri&s;que his property, his health, and his life, on a tedious and dangerous voyage, merely to fulfil the de|crees of Heaven, It is pre&s;umed, that &s;uch an in&s;tance cannot be found, among the &s;ons of men. And tho&s;e per&s;ons who ju&s;tify &s;lavery by the permi&s;&s;ion, or command of God, mu&s;t believe that the omni&s;cient Jehovah paid but a &s;lender regard to a part of his will, which is oppo&s;ed by every emotion of genero&s;ity, compa&s;&s;ion and &s;en&s;ibility, when he &s;ubmitted the chance of its propagation, to the uncertain management of human intere&s;t.</P>
<P>PERSUADED that Intere&s;t then is the only &s;up|port of a practice &s;o wicked, &s;o dete&s;table, and &s;o de&s;tructive in its effects on the human mind, I &s;hall be pardoned for the manife&s;tation, at lea&s;t of earne&s;tne&s;s, in the following de&s;ultory re|marks, on &s;ome of the rea&s;ons, urged again&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="026922_0005_0FD2642DA6C60298">
the total abolition of &s;lavery, in the &s;tate of Con|necticut. The&s;e remarks may perhaps be in|ter&s;per&s;ed, or &s;ucceeded by others, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure de&s;criptive of its nature, and of its effects on the human mind.</P>
<P>WITHIN a few years pa&s;t, the &s;ubject of &s;la|very has been repeatedly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, in the legi&s;|lature of this &s;tate, with great force of rea&s;oning, and eloquence. The inju&s;tice of it has been generally, if not uniformly acknowledged; and the practice of it &s;everely reprobated. But when the que&s;tion of total abolition has been &s;e|riou&s;ly put, it has met with &s;teady oppo&s;ition, and has hitherto mi&s;carried, on the ground of politi|cal expediency&mdash;That is, it is confe&s;&s;ed to be <HI>morally wrong,</HI> to subject any cla&s;s of our fellow|creatures to the evils of &s;lavery; but a&s;&s;erted to be <HI>politically right, to keep them</HI> in &s;uch &s;ubjec|tion. Without attending to this &s;trange, and unfounded doctrine, in it&s;elf, I will con&s;ider &s;ome of the arguments, u&s;ed in &s;upport of that political rectitude.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid, that the &s;lavery of negroes was in|troduced <HI>by our ance&s;tors</HI>&mdash;who, are acknow|ledged to have been generally humane and pi|ous, and yet never que&s;tioned its rectitude; from them it <HI>de&s;cended to us</HI>; therefore, as <HI>we inherit</HI> the evil, we are at liberty to extricate our|&s;elves from it <HI>by degrees</HI>; and are not bound to do it <HI>immediately.</HI> In &s;upport of this doctrine, we are told&mdash;that, tho' <HI>the blacks</HI> have a claim to ju&s;tice, <HI>the whites</HI> have al&s;o a claim; that by doing <HI>&s;trict ju&s;tice</HI> to them, we &s;hall do <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> to our&s;elves; and that we ought not to con&s;ult the intere&s;ts of <HI>one part of the community,</HI> at the expen&s;e of <HI>another.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="026922_0006_0FD2642EC9037AD8">IT being then acknowledged, that the en&s;lav|ing of Africans was wrong in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, that the continuance of it is wrong: for a continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of un|ju&s;t actions, can never gain the pure character of ju&s;tice. If it was originally wrong, it has never cea&s;ed to be wrong for a moment &s;ince; and length of time, in&s;tead of &s;actioning, aggra|vates the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. This mode of rea&s;oning is uniformly adopted by courts of ju&s;tice, when deciding on que&s;tions of property, by the rules of municipal law. No tribunal ever admitted a plea of inju&s;tice on the part of a father, in vindi|cation of his &s;on, to whom the fruits of his ille|gal, or wicked conduct had de&s;cended. So far is this from the fact, that every per&s;on, found guilty of withholding &s;trict ju&s;tice from his neighbour, on &s;uch a frivolous pretence, is forced by the laws of his country to compen&s;ate the per&s;on injured, for every moment, during which the claim remains unan&s;wered. And certainly, the moral law enjoins a very different doctrine from that, again&s;t which I am contending. <Q>I the Lord, am a jealous God, vi&s;iting the ini|quities of the fathers, upon the children</Q>&mdash;is the &s;trong, and unequivocal language of the decalogue. And if any man &s;hould deny &s;ub|&s;tantial right to another, for the rea&s;ons which I have mentioned, the voice of common &s;en&s;e, as well as of law, would ju&s;tify his creditor in ca&s;t|ing him into pri&s;on, until he &s;hould pay the ut|termo&s;t farthing. And what is the real ground of this difference, in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, between white men, and negroes? Simply this&mdash;the white men can appeal to the laws of their country, and enforce their rights. The negroes whom our fathers, and our&s;elves have en&s;laved,
<PB N="8" REF="026922_0007_0FD26431EE1D30E8">
have no tribunal to li&s;ten to their complaints, or to redre&s;s their injuries. Forced from their coun|try, their friends, and their families, they are dragged to the &s;ufferance of &s;lavery, of torture, and of death, with no eye, and no arm, but the eye and arm of God, to pity, and to puni&s;h their wrongs. Society recognizes their exi&s;tence, only for the purpo&s;es of inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion, and puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>BY doing &s;trict ju&s;tice to the negroes, I pre|&s;ume is meant, totally to aboli&s;h &s;lavery, and place them on the &s;ame ground, with free white men. The inju&s;tice, which, it is conten|ded, will proceed from the immediate accom|pli&s;hment of this end, in the fir&s;t place re&s;|pects the property of the per&s;ons, who hold &s;laves. It is &s;aid, that they were purcha&s;ed under the &s;anction of the laws of the country; and therefore, arbitrarily to deprive the own|ers of &s;uch property, without any retribution, would be inju&s;tice. This is combining two que&s;tions, which have no relation to each other. The right of the &s;lave to liberty, is a di&s;tinct con&s;ideration, from the right of the ma&s;ter to a compen&s;ation for the lo&s;s of his &s;lave. Nor will the act of government, in granting freedom to the &s;lave, weaken the ma&s;ter's claim for that compen&s;ation; but if it is ju&s;t, at the time when the &s;lave is &s;et at liberty, it will for|ever remain ju&s;t until it is &s;atisfied. Emanci|pating the &s;lave, then, &s;ubject the ma&s;ter to no di&s;advantage, in obtaining from govern|ment the value of the &s;lave; and therefore holding the &s;lave in bondage, until com|pen&s;ation is made to the ma&s;ter, is clearly unju&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="026922_0008_0FD26433BA240880">BUT this que&s;tion mu&s;t be con&s;idered on ve|ry different ground. "The rights of per&s;ons," &s;ays a &s;en&s;ible writer on the laws of England, <Q>con&s;idered in their natural capacities, are of two forts, ab&s;olute, and relative. By the ab|&s;olute rights of mankind, we mean tho&s;e, which are &s;o in their primary, and &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e; &s;uch as would belong to their per&s;ons merely in a &s;tate of nature, and which every man is entitled to enjoy, whether out of &s;oci|ety, or in it. And the&s;e may be reduced to three principal, or primary articles; the right of per&s;onal &s;ecurity, the right of per&s;on|al liberty, and the right of private property.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black&s;tone's Commentaries.</NOTE> No per&s;on, who hears me, will deny the ju&s;tice, or rea&s;onablene&s;s of this doctrine. Con&s;idering it, then, as acknowledged, it is evident, that the right of private property, &s;tanding in a &s;tation, &s;ubordinate to the right of per&s;onal &s;ecurity, and the right of per&s;onal liberty, merits an inferiour con&s;ideration. Therefore, previou&s;ly to di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing, and e&s;tabli&s;hing the right of private pro|perty, the rights of per&s;onal &s;ecurity, and per|&s;onal liberty, mu&s;t be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and e&s;tabli&s;hed. If this rea&s;oning be ju&s;t, it is impo&s;&s;ible, in any &s;ituation, or under the authority of any laws, to acquire a property in a human being. For it cannot be acquired, without a violation of rights, to which he has a prior, and ab&s;olute claim; and which are of inconceivably greater import|ance. The re&s;ult, then, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, that, in aboli&s;hing African &s;lavery, no injury is done to private property.</P>
<P>BUT granting, for the moment, that proper|ty
<PB N="10" REF="026922_0009_0FD26434A60E8DC0">
can be gained in the body and mind of man; a conce&s;&s;ion which can &s;carcely be made, for the &s;ake of argument, without horror; I deny, that any &s;uch property ever was gained, in this &s;tate, under the &s;anction of law. Search the &s;tatute books of Connecticut, from the date of its Charter to the pre&s;ent moment, and tell me where is the law which e&s;tabli&s;hes &s;uch an inhu|man privilege? Happily for the honour of the &s;tate, tho&s;e books were never &s;tained with &s;o black a &s;tatute. But it will be replied, that &s;lavery is &s;anctioned by Pre&s;cription, and impli|citly allowed by the laws of the land. "To make a particular Cu&s;tom good," &s;ays the accom|pli&s;hed juri&s;prudent, from whom I have already quoted, <Q>the following are nece&s;&s;ary requi|&s;ites&mdash;That it have been u&s;ed &s;o long, that the memory of man runneth not to the con|trary. So that if any one can &s;hew the begin|ning of it, it is no good cu&s;tom.</Q> It would not be a difficult ta&s;k, to di&s;cover the beginning of the Cu&s;tom under con&s;ideration. "It mu&s;t have been continued. Which mu&s;t be under&s;tood of the right; for if the right be any how di&s;continu|ed for a day, the Cu&s;tom is quite at an end."&mdash;The right of the Cu&s;tom of &s;lavery, is given up by much the greater part of the community. "It mu&s;t have been peaceable&mdash;It mu&s;t be rea&s;ona|ble." Surely no man will contend that this Cu&s;tom is either peaceable, or rea&s;onable. The rea&s;on of man ri&s;es in uniform oppo&s;ition to it; and it is marked in every &s;tage with war, barba|rity, and murder.</P>
<P>BUT if this Pre&s;cription, or Cu&s;tom, when tri|ed by the rules of the Engli&s;h common law, would &s;tand the te&s;t, &s;till I contend, that no pre|&s;criptive right, can infringe the ab&s;olute rights of
<PB N="11" REF="026922_0010_0FD264364E867D98">
mankind. The&s;e, e&s;pecially per&s;onal &s;ecurity, and per&s;onal liberty, cannot be violated but by the po&s;itive laws of &s;ociety. Such laws, I have already remarked, do not exi&s;t, in the code of Connecticut. But in that code there does exi&s;t a law, which &s;peaks emphatically the oppo&s;ite language. <Q>No man's per&s;on &s;hall be arre&s;ted, re&s;trained, or any ways puni&s;hed&mdash;No man &s;hall be deprived of his wife, or children&mdash;No man's goods or e&s;tate &s;hall be taken away from him, nor any ways indama|ged, under colour of the law, or countenance of authority, un|le&s;s clearly warranted by the laws of this &s;tate.</Q> Are not negroes men? Are they not arre&s;ted, re&s;trained, and puni&s;hed? Are they not depri|ved of their wives, and children? Are not their goods and e&s;tate taken from them, and endama|ged, under colour of law, and countenance of authority alone? For the Cu&s;tom, &s;o often men|tioned, can have no force, if there is a po&s;itive &s;tatute authorizing African &s;lavery; and if there is no &s;uch &s;tatute, African &s;lavery mu&s;t owe its ex|i&s;tence, &s;olely to the countenance of authority.</P>
<P>BUT to make a &s;till &s;tronger conce&s;&s;ion, in fa|vour of the friends of &s;lavery than tho&s;e already made, viz. That the ab&s;olute rights of indivi|duals <HI>are</HI> &s;ubject to violation, under the author|ity of Cu&s;tom, and that &s;uch Cu&s;tom, having ob|tained, <HI>is</HI> clearly warranted by the laws of this &s;tate, yet I venture to a&s;&s;ert, that no Cu&s;tom and no Law, which a &s;tate where &s;lavery is practi&s;ed, either has made, or can make, ought to affect the en&s;laved negroes at all, unle&s;s de&s;igned as a partial compen&s;ation for the injuries which they have &s;uf|fered&mdash;injuries, for which all the wealth of man can never alone. The right of &s;ociety to make
<PB N="12" REF="026922_0011_0FD26437B78C5258">
laws of any de&s;cription, depends entirely on the original compact, which formed the &s;ociety. This compact, mu&s;t have the real, or implied a&s;&s;ent of every per&s;on, who is to be bound by the regulations of the &s;ociety. Every per&s;on, then, who is forced to &s;ubmit to the laws, and in&s;titutions of &s;ociety, has a right to be heard, either in per&s;on, or by his repre&s;entative, when tho&s;e laws and in&s;titutions are framed; and every per&s;on, who is forced to &s;ubmit to &s;uch laws and in&s;titutions, without the opportunity of being thus heard, is forced to &s;ubmit to the hard, and oppre&s;&s;ive hand of Tyranny. Slaves then, having never really, nor impliedly agreed to any &s;ocial compact, and never being heard, either per&s;onally, or repre&s;entatively in the le|gi&s;lature, form no part of the &s;ocial body; and therefore cannot ju&s;tly be the object of laws, except in the ca&s;e I have already in&s;tanced. On the contrary, &s;o far from uniting voluntarily with &s;ocieties, in this country, they are bro't in|to them by force, and by force &s;ubjected to the laws, and regulations of powers, which they ne|ver acknowledged, and to which they owe nei|ther obedience, nor gratitude. Being thus for|ced into a &s;tate of ho&s;tility, if defen&s;ive war is &s;u&s;ceptible of ju&s;tification, in any po&s;&s;ible in&s;tance, this is that in&s;tance. Their lives, their proper|ty, their liberty, their happine&s;s, are perpetually expo&s;ed to the inroads of every mercile&s;s in|vader. And tho', as the fini&s;hing &s;troke to their &s;y&s;tems of guilt, &s;ocieties think fit to puni&s;h tho&s;e acts in &s;laves, which indeed in their own mem|bers, would be both civil and moral evils; yet, probably on the &s;trength of rea&s;oning &s;imilar to that which I have adopted, an elegant Engli&s;h writer, pronounces it "impo&s;&s;ible for a &s;lave, to be guilty of a civil crime." The &s;ame law,<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages"></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="026922_0012_0FD26439E5024228">ANOTHER con&s;equence of &s;lavery, is a &s;pirit of domination. For proof of this, we may ap|ply to tho&s;e parts of the United States, where &s;lavery is mo&s;t exten&s;ively practi&s;ed. In the four &s;outhern &s;tates, there exi&s;ts the &s;tronge&s;t &s;pirit of ari&s;tocracy to be found in the union. This a&s;&s;ertion I dare to make, in defiance of all the clamour, which can be rai&s;ed to contradict it. Where is that &s;pirit of republicani&s;m, equality, freedom, and enmity to tyranny, of which they &s;o arrogantly boa&s;t? Believe me, they exi&s;t but in found. Dome&s;tic de&s;poti&s;m rides tri|umphantly over the liberties, and happine&s;s of thou&s;ands of our fellow-creatures, in each of tho&s;e pretended republics. In no other country on earth, is &s;lavery carried to &s;uch a length of oppre&s;&s;ion. Not contented with the common round of cruelty and wickedne&s;s, the ma&s;ters there mock their &s;laves with the name of privi|leges, which they never enjoy; and thus force them to contribute to the &s;trengthening of the powers, which hold them in bondage. Enjoy|ing no rank in the community, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing no voice, either in elections, or legi&s;lation, the &s;laves are bro't into exi&s;tence, in the Con&s;titu|tion of the United States, merely to afford oppor|tunity for a few more of their ma&s;ters, to tyran|nize over their liberties. And no event could fill the&s;e &s;tates with &s;uch alarming apprehen&s;ions, as the erection of the &s;tandard of Freedom among their en&s;laved &s;ubjects. Therefore, before they upbraid the citizens of the northern &s;tates, with an attachment to the principles of ari&s;tocracy, or monarchy, let them begin the equal commu|nication of tho&s;e privileges, which <HI>in theory,</HI> they confe&s;s to be the birth right of man.

<P>AT the pre&s;ent period, when the principles of liberty are &s;o highly revered, and the practice of them &s;o ju&s;tly admired, every que&s;tion, in which they are involved, ought to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by the &s;ounde&s;t rea&s;on, and e&s;tabli&s;hed on the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice. For when the per&s;ons intere&s;ted in the event of &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, are of &s;ufficient force to be formidable, tho&s;e who are hardy enough to withhold their unalienable rights, will find them&s;elves plunged in a deluge of calamity. Every in&s;tance on hi&s;torical re|cord, and every example before our eyes, abun|dantly teaches this &s;olemn truth. Without wa&s;ting time in multiplying ca&s;es, I will only re|&s;ort to one of the latter de&s;cription. The &s;itua|tion of France, and &s;ome of her mo&s;t important

When the coun|cils of the nation were guided by di&s;cretion and integrity, the &s;urrounding world beheld with admiration and applau&s;e, a &s;tupendous object in the great &s;y&s;tem of Providence&mdash;one of the mo&s;t numerous and mighty nations, on the earth, led by the hand of Rea&s;on alone to the acqui&s;ition of freedom and happine&s;s. But when the gov|ernment was &s;iezed by a profligate, and blood|thir&s;ty junto, which, for a period, forced the infatuated republic to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination and ruin,

<P>FROM France, turn your attention to the i&s;land of St. Domingo. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of unju&s;t, and contradictory mea&s;ures, in both the national and colonial governments, at length highly ex|a&s;perated the negroes, and rou&s;ed their &s;pirits to unanimity and fanatici&s;m. Seized by the phren|zy of oppre&s;&s;ed human nature, they &s;uddenly awoke from the lethargy of &s;lavery, attacked their tyrannical ma&s;ters, &s;pread de&s;olation and blood over the face of the colony, and by a &s;e|ries of vigorous efforts, e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves on
<PB N="19" REF="026922_0016_0FD26442E4949FC0">
the firm pillars of freedom and independence. Driven from their hou&s;es and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, by new and exulting ma&s;ters, the dome&s;tic tyrants of that i&s;land wander over the face of the earth, de|pendent on the uncertain hand of Charity for &s;helter, and for bread. To the honour of Amer|icans, it is true, that in this country, they have realized the mo&s;t liberal humanity. But by a di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence which Humanity mu&s;t applaud, they are forced to exhibit, in the mo&s;t convincing manner, this important truth&mdash;that de&s;poti&s;m and cruelty, whether in the family, or the nation, can never re&s;i&s;t the energy of enrag|ed and oppre&s;&s;ed man, &s;truggling for freedom.</P>
<P>THESE evils may perhaps appear di&s;tant from us; yet to &s;ome of our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates they are probably nigh, even at the doors. Ideas of lib|erty and &s;lavery, have taken &s;uch &s;trong hold of the negroes, that unle&s;s their &s;ituation is &s;udden|ly ameliorated, the inhabitants of the &s;outhern &s;tates, will have the utmo&s;t rea&s;on to dread the effects of in&s;urrection. And with the example of the We&s;t-Indies before their eyes, they will be wor&s;e than mad, if they do not adopt effectu|al mea&s;ures to e&s;cape their danger. To oppo&s;e the &s;laves by force when in a &s;tate of rebellion, or to hold them in their pre&s;ent condition, for any con&s;iderable length of time in future, will be beyond their &s;trength. Courage and di&s;ci|pline, form but a feeble front, to check the on&s;et of freedom.

warfare? Surely, no friend to freedom and ju&s;|tice will dare to lend them his aid. In a ca&s;e, not e&s;&s;entially different in principle from the one under con&s;ideration, except its being le&s;s aggravated, the God of Heaven has uttered the following denunciation. <Q>Therefore thus &s;aith the Lord, ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty every one to his neigh|bour, and every man to his brother: Behold I proclaim a liberty for you, &s;aith the Lord, to the &s;word, to the pe&s;tilence, and to the famine. And I will make you to be removed into all the face of the earth. And I will give the men that have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed my covenant, into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them, which &s;eek their life.

Indeed the pro|phecy has been mo&s;t minutely fulfilled in the i&s;l|and already mentioned.</P>
<P>IN this &s;tate indeed, and with the &s;incere&s;t plea&s;ure I make the remark, in con&s;equence of the &s;mall number of &s;laves, the advancement of civilization, and the diffu&s;ion of a liberal policy, the &s;ituation of the negroes is e&s;&s;entially differ|ent. Expo&s;ed to few &s;evere puni&s;hments, and indulged in many amu&s;ements, compared with what is found in mo&s;t other countries, they are here flouri&s;hing, and happy. But even here they are &s;laves. The very idea embitters every enjoy|ment.

So nece&s;&s;ary is freedom to happine&s;s, that the mind, well informed of its nature, and acquainted with its ble&s;&s;ings, if &s;ubjected to the will of an arbitrary and cruel ma&s;ter, would be wretched and &s;olitary, altho' &s;urrounded by all the plea&s;ures of the garden of God. But as &s;laves do in fact exi&s;t in Connecticut, the in|habitants of the &s;tate, as it re&s;pects this great &s;ub|ject, mu&s;t be divided into two cla&s;&s;es&mdash;tho&s;e, who ju&s;tify &s;lavery in the ab&s;tract&mdash;and tho&s;e, who condemn it. And this general divi&s;ion will be found to comprehend every intermediate &s;tage of character. For tho' the number of per&s;ons is &s;mall, who will avowedly advocate the prin|ciples of &s;lavery; yet &s;uch per&s;ons do not only exi&s;t, but have the hardihood to appeal for ar|guments to &s;upport their barbarous &s;entiments, to the fountain of our holy religion, which breathes nought but peace and good will to man. But there is another more &s;pecious de&s;crip|tion of per&s;ons, which I cla&s;s among the enemies of the freedom and happine&s;s of mankind. The&s;e per&s;ons pro&s;e&s;&s;edly acknowledge the wickedne&s;s of &s;lavery, and &s;till, on the pretence of political expediency, u&s;e every artifice of ingenuity and fraud, to rivet the fetters, which bind their fel|low creatures in bondage. Such per&s;ons, deaf to the voice of Rea&s;on, and the &s;upplications of Humanity, bend every object to the advancement of their wealth, and the gratification of their ambition; while the groans of dying Innocence, the &s;creams of violated Cha&s;tity, and the ravings of tortured Maniacks, would &s;leep on their ears like the gentle mu&s;ick of the pa&s;&s;ing gale. To &s;uch per&s;ons, as well as to tho&s;e of the &s;econd cla&s;s, which I have mentioned, a few en&s;laved, wretched beings, appeal for the ble&s;&s;ings of free|dom.

On the part of the &s;laves, it is a que&s;tion of right; and on that of the &s;tate, a que&s;tion of ju&s;tice&mdash;a que&s;tion, which cannot be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the &s;trong pleadings of Avarice, nor hidden in the &s;ubterfuges of Sophi&s;try. The fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;pirits is not more oppo&s;ed to humanity, than the latter is to integrity. Sophi&s;try may at times a&s;&s;i&s;t the advocate at the bar, when e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of iniquity; but in a legi&s;la|tor it mu&s;t ever be infamous, and the con&s;cience of an hone&s;t man will never &s;ubmit to its impo|&s;ition. Nor &s;hould motives of ambition be &s;uf|fered to operate, to the de&s;truction of human happine&s;s. It is a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of too much value, to be held by &s;o frail a tenure. Depraved indeed mu&s;t be the heart of that man, who will &s;werve from the rigid rules of ju&s;tice and duty, to aid his ambitious projects. Equally depraved, and if po&s;&s;ible more execrable, is the unfeeling fav|age, who will lengthen out the mi&s;ery of a fel|low being with a &s;mile of &s;arca&s;tic plea&s;ure on his fraudful countenance. In the hour of di&s;tre&s;s and apprehen&s;ion, gloomy and bitter mu&s;t be the reflections of &s;uch a mind. But to the mind animated with a love of ju&s;tice, and glowing with the pure&s;t benevolence, the valley of the &s;hadow of death, will open a peaceful pa&s;&s;age to the pre&s;ence of his God.</P>
<P>IF the arguments which I have u&s;ed, as well as innumerable others which are con&s;tantly urged in oppo&s;ition to &s;lavery, cannot be fully an&s;wered and refuted, may it not be hoped, that this re|lique of oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;o odious and &s;o wicked, will be &s;peedily extirpated in the &s;tate of Con|necticut. Why &s;hould a countenance in this hap|py land, be &s;addened with the melancholy evil!

Can it be urged as a rea&s;on for its continuance, that the &s;laves, not being numerous enough to become trouble&s;ome, are unworthy of the pub+lic attention? A regard to the happine&s;s of be|ings, occupying but a point in his dominions, de&s;titute even of the claim of ju&s;tice, and depen|dent on his will for exi&s;tence, induced the Son of the living God to exchange the bo&s;om of his Father, for a cruel, and ignominious death. And &s;hall we refu&s;e &s;o &s;lightly to imitate this illu&s;tri|ous example? The &s;laves are &s;ufficiently nume|rous, and &s;ufficiently important, to be highly in|jured, by being &s;tripped of the only ble&s;&s;ing, which can render life worth enjoying.
