<SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_BY this Time, I &s;uppo&s;e, you have heard of my having been at <HI>Li&s;bon,</HI> and are wonder|ing what led me thither, e&s;pecially &s;ince my la&s;t informed you of my Intention to go to <HI>Georgia</HI> by way of <HI>New-York.</HI> This was really my De&s;ign at the Time of my writ|ing; but being afterward called by Providence to take with me &s;everal Orphan-children, I thought it mo&s;t advi&s;eable to go and &s;ettle them, and my other dome&s;tick Affairs, at the Orphan-hou&s;e fir&s;t; that I might vi&s;it the northern Parts of <HI>America</HI> with more Ea&s;e and Freedom in my own Mind.&mdash;It happened that the <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> Capt. <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> bound for <HI>Port Royal, South Carolina,</HI> (which is not very far from <HI>Georgia</HI>) was then almo&s;t ready to &s;ail.&mdash;I &s;ent for the Owner, and finding that the Ship was to touch at <HI>Li&s;bon</HI> to unload &s;ome Wheat, it occa&s;ioned a little Demurr; but, upon &s;econd Thoughts, believing it might be &s;erviceable to me, as a Preacher and Prote&s;tant, to &s;ee &s;omething of the Super&s;titions of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> I took my Pa&s;&s;age and embarked in the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> the 7th of <HI>March.</HI>&mdash;On the 14th we reached <HI>Cape Fini&s;ter.</HI>&mdash;On the 15th came in &s;ight of the <HI>Burlings;</HI> and on the 16th anchored &s;afe before <HI>Bellem,</HI> about four Miles di&s;tance from <HI>Li&s;bon</HI> City, the Metropolis of <HI>Portugal.</HI>&mdash;As I knew no-body there, and had formed but an indifferent Idea of the Inhabitants, from the Account that had been given me
<PB N="4" REF="007590_0004_102BA555644AC968">
of them, I had purpo&s;ed within my&s;elf to keep on Board, and go a&s;hore only now and then in the Day-time.&mdash;But Providence &s;o ordered it, that a Gentleman of the Factory, who had heard me him&s;elf, and who&s;e Brother had been awakened under my Mini&s;try &s;everal Years ago, immediately, upon hearing of my Arrival, &s;ent me an Offer of his Hou&s;e during my Stay.&mdash;I thankfully accepted it; and &s;pecial Leave being procured for my going a&s;hore, I was carried in a Chai&s;e and Pair from <HI>Bellem</HI> to <HI>Li&s;bon.</HI>&mdash;A new Scene, both in re&s;pect to the Situation of the Place, the Fa&s;hion of the Buildings, and the Dre&s;s of the Inhabitants, pre&s;ented it&s;elf all the way.&mdash;But what engaged my Attention mo&s;t, was the Frequency of Crucifixes and little Images of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and other real or reputed Saints, which were placed almo&s;t in every Street, or fixed again&s;t the Walls of the Hou&s;es almo&s;t at every Turning, with Lamps hanging before them.&mdash;To the&s;e I ob&s;erved the People bow as they pa&s;&s;ed along; and near &s;ome of them &s;tood &s;everal little Compa|nies, &s;inging with great Earne&s;tne&s;s.&mdash;This &s;eemed to me very odd, and gave me an Idea of what further eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cu|rio&s;ities would probably fall in my way, if I &s;hould be detained any time here.&mdash;The&s;e Expectations were quickly rai&s;ed;&mdash;For, not long after my Arrival at my new Lodgings, (where I was received and entertained with great Gentility, Ho&s;pita|lity, and Friendline&s;s) upon looking out of the Window, I &s;aw a Company of Prie&s;ts and Friars bearing lighted Wax-Tapers, and attended by various &s;orts of People, &s;ome of which had Bags and Ba&s;kets of Victuals in their Hands, and others carried Provi&s;ions upon their Shoulders on Sticks be|tween two. After the&s;e followed a mixed Multitude, &s;ing|ing with a very audible Voice, and addre&s;&s;ing the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> in their u&s;ual Strain, "<HI>Ora pro nobis.</HI>" In this Man|ner they proceeded to the Pri&s;on, where all was depo&s;ited for the U&s;e of the poor Per&s;ons confined therein.&mdash;But a far more pompous Proce&s;&s;ion of the like Nature (as a Stander-by informed me) pa&s;&s;ed by a few Days after.&mdash;In this there were near three hundred Franci&s;can Friars, many of which
<PB N="5" REF="007590_0005_102BA531F97D7BC8">
(be&s;ides Porters hired for the Purpo&s;e) were loaded with a Variety of Food; and tho&s;e who bore no Burden, carried either Ladles or Spoons in their Hands.&mdash;Sights of this Na|ture being quite a Novelty to me, I was fond of attending as many of them as I could. Two things concurred to make them more frequent at this Juncture, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sea&s;on of <HI>Lent,</HI> and an exce&s;&s;ive Drought, which threatened the total De|&s;truction of the Fruits of the Earth.&mdash;For the averting &s;o great a Judgement, and for the imploring the much longed-for Ble&s;&s;ing of Rain, daily Proce&s;&s;ions had been made from one Convent or another for a con&s;iderable Time.&mdash;One of the&s;e I &s;aw: It was looked upon as a pretty grand one, be|ing made up of the Carmelite Friars, the Pari&s;h Prie&s;ts, and a great Number of what they call the Brothers of the Order, who walked two by two in divers Habits, holding a long and very large lighted Wax-taper in their right Hands.&mdash;Amid&s;t the&s;e was carried, upon eight or ten Mens Shoulders, a tall Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> in a kind of Man's Attire; for I think &s;he had a very fine white Wig on her Head, (a Dre&s;s &s;he often appears in) and was much adorned with Jewels and glittering Stones.&mdash;At &s;ome Di&s;tance from the Lady, under a large Canopy of State, and &s;upported likewi&s;e by &s;ix or eight Per&s;ons, came a Prie&s;t, holding in his Hand &s;ome noted Relick.&mdash;After him followed &s;everal Thou&s;ands of People, joining with the Friars in &s;inging <Q><HI>Eandem cantile|nam, Ora pro nobis,</HI></Q> all the way.&mdash;Still Rain was denied, and &s;till Proce&s;&s;ions were continued.&mdash;At length the Clouds began to gather, and the Mercury in the Barometer fell very much.&mdash;Then was brought out a wooden Image, which they &s;ay never failed.&mdash;It was the Figure of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord, cloathed with purple Robes, and crowned with Thorns. I think they call him the LORD OF THE PASSION.&mdash;Upon his Shoulders he bore a large Cro&s;s, under the Weight of which he was repre&s;ented as &s;tooping, 'till his Body bent al|mo&s;t double.&mdash;He was brought from the <HI>Le Gra&s;s</HI> Convent in very great Pomp, and placed in a large Cathedral Church.&mdash;Being on Board at that Time I lo&s;t this Sight: But the &s;ub|&s;equent
<PB N="6" REF="007590_0006_102BA557798F5DE8">
Evening I beheld the SEIGNEUR fixed on an Emi|nence in a large Cathedral Church, near the Altar, &s;urrounded with Wax-tapers of a prodigious Size.&mdash;He was attended by many Noble-men, and Thou&s;ands of Spectators of all Ranks and Stations, who crouded from every Quarter, and, in their Turns, were admitted by the Guards to come within the Rails and perform their Devotions.&mdash;This they expre&s;&s;ed by kneeling, and ki&s;&s;ing the SEIGNEUR'S Heel, by putting their left and right Eye to it, and then touching it with their Beads, which a Gentleman in waiting received from them, and then returned again.&mdash;This Scene was repeated for three Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and during all this time the Church and Space before it was &s;o thronged with Carriages and People, that there was &s;carce any pa&s;&s;ing.&mdash;The Mu&s;ick on this Occa&s;ion was extremely &s;oft, and the Church was illuminated in a very &s;triking Manner.&mdash;The third Day in the Forenoon it rained, and &s;oon after the SEIGNEUR was conducted home in as great Splendour, and much greater Rejoicing, than when he was brought forth.&mdash;As my Situation was very commodious, I &s;aw the whole; and afterwards went and heard Part of the Sermon, which was delivered before him in the Church to which the SEIGNEUR belonged.&mdash;The Preacher was full of Action; and in &s;ome Part of his Di&s;cour&s;e, (as one who under&s;tood <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> informed me) pointing to the Image, he &s;aid, <Q>Now he is at Re&s;t.&mdash;He went out in Ju&s;tice, but is returned in Mercy.</Q>&mdash;And towards the Conclu&s;ion he called upon the People to join with him in an extempore Prayer. This they did with great Fervency, which was ex|pre&s;&s;ed not only by repeating it loud, but by beating their Brea&s;ts, and clapping their Cheeks, and weeping heartily.&mdash;To compleat the Solemnity, immediately after the delivery of the Ble&s;&s;ing, all on a &s;udden, from the Place near which the Image &s;tood, there was heard a mo&s;t &s;oft and &s;oothing Symphony of Mu&s;ic, which being ended, the A&s;&s;embly broke up, and I returned to my Lodgings, not a little affected to &s;ee &s;o many Thou&s;ands led away from the Simplicity of the Go&s;pel, by &s;uch a Mixture of human Artifice and blind Super|&s;tition,
<PB N="7" REF="007590_0007_102BA53381C9CB50">
of which indeed I could have formed no Idea, had I not been an Eye-Witne&s;s of it my&s;elf.&mdash;This Concern was &s;till increa&s;ed by what I heard from &s;ome of my fellow Pa&s;|&s;engers, who informed me, that about eleven one Night, after I came aboard, they not only heard a Fryar preaching mo&s;t fervently before the SEIGNEUR, but al&s;o &s;aw &s;everal Companies of Penitents brought in, la&s;hing and whipping them&s;elves &s;everely.&mdash;How little unlike this to tho&s;e who cut them&s;elves with Knives and Lancets, and cried out from Morning till Night, "<HI>O Baal hear us.</HI>"&mdash;Methinks I hear you &s;ay, and had I been pre&s;ent, I &s;hould have wi&s;hed for the Spirit of an <HI>Elijah</HI> to&mdash;Hu&s;h, my Friend&mdash;I am content to gue&s;s at the re&s;t 'till we meet.&mdash;In the mean while, let us comfort our&s;elves with this Thought, that there is a Sea&s;on approaching, when the Lord God of <HI>Elijah</HI> will him|&s;elf come, and de&s;troy this and every other Species of Anti|chri&s;t <HI>by the Breath of his Mouth, and the Brightne&s;s of his appearing,</HI> even by the all-conquering Manife&s;tations of his Eternal Spirit.&mdash;Whether as Men, Chri&s;tians, and Prote&s;|tants, we have not more and more Rea&s;on to pray Night and Day for the ha&s;tening on of that glorious and long wi&s;hed-for Period, you will be better able to judge, when I &s;end you (as I purpo&s;e to do, if I have Time) a further Account of a <HI>Lent</HI> Proce&s;&s;ion or two, of which I was al&s;o a Spectator&mdash;At pre&s;ent I can only beg a continual Remem|brance at a Throne of Grace, as being, my dear Friend,</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THOUGH &s;ome other Bu&s;ine&s;s demands my At|tention, yet I mu&s;t not forget the Promi&s;e made you of a further Account of the Proce&s;&s;ions I &s;aw at <HI>Li&s;bon.</HI>&mdash;Some of tho&s;e already mentioned were extraordi|nary, by Rea&s;on of their great Drought; but that which is to be the Subject of my pre&s;ent Letter was an annual one; it being always cu&s;tomary at <HI>Li&s;bon</HI> to exhibit &s;ome Proce&s;&s;ion or another every <HI>Friday</HI> in Lent.&mdash;An intelligent Prote&s;tant who &s;tood near me, was &s;o good as to be my Interpreter of the Dumb Shew as it pa&s;&s;ed along&mdash;I &s;ay <HI>Dumb Shew</HI>&mdash;For you mu&s;t know it was chiefly made up of waxen or wooden Images, and carried on Mens Shoulders through the Streets, intending to repre&s;ent the Life and Death of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> the Founder of one of their religious Orders.&mdash;They were brought out from the <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Convent, and were preceded by three Per&s;ons in &s;carlet Habits with Ba&s;kets in their Hands, in which they received the Alms of the Spec|tators, for the Benefit of the poor Pri&s;oners.&mdash;After the&s;e, came two little Boys in Party-colour'd Cloaths, with Wings fixed on their Shoulders, in Imitation of little Angels.&mdash;Then appeared the Figure of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> very gay and Beau|like, as he u&s;ed to be before his Conver&s;ion.&mdash;In the next, he was introduced under Conviction, and con&s;equently &s;tript of his Finery.&mdash;Soon after this was exhibited, an Image of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf, in a purple Gown with long black Hair, with St. <HI>Francis</HI> lying before him, to receive his im|mediate Orders.&mdash;Then came the Virgin Mother, (<HI>horre&s;co referens</HI>) with Chri&s;t her Son at her left Hand, and St. <HI>Fran|cis</HI> making his Obey&s;ance to both.&mdash;Here, if I remember
<PB N="9" REF="007590_0009_102BA5368BC66780">
aright, he made his fir&s;t Appearance in his Friar's Habit with his Hair cut &s;hort, but not as yet &s;haved in the Crown of his Head:&mdash;After a little Space followed a mitred Cardinal gau|dily attired, and before him lay St. <HI>Francis</HI> almo&s;t pro&s;trate, in order to be confirmed in his Office.&mdash;Soon after this he appears quite metamorpho&s;ed into a Monk, his Crown &s;horn, his Habit black, and his Loins girt with a Knotted Cord.&mdash;Here he prays to our Saviour hanging on a Cro&s;s, that the Marks of the Wounds in his Hands, Feet, and Side, might be impre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ame Parts of his Body.&mdash;The Prayer is granted; Blood comes from the Hands, Feet, and Side; and the Saint with great Devotion receives the Impre&s;&s;ions.&mdash;This was repre&s;ented by red waxen Strings, reaching from tho&s;e Parts of the Image to the corre&s;ponding Parts of St. <HI>Francis</HI> his Body.&mdash;Upon this he begins to do Wonders; and therefore in a little while he was carried along, holding up a Hou&s;e which was ju&s;t falling.&mdash;This Miracle they &s;ay was performed (if my Information be true) at <HI>Madrid,</HI> but the Particulars of its Hi&s;tory I have forgotten.&mdash;At length the Father dies, and is brought forth lying in his Grave.&mdash;But lo! the Briars and Nettles under which he lay, are turned into fine and fragrant Flowers.&mdash;After this he is born along upon a Bier covered with a Silver Pall, and four Friars lamenting over him.&mdash;He then appears for the la&s;t Time, but with an Increa&s;e of Power; for he was repre&s;ented as drawing tor|mented People out of Purgatory with his knotted Cord, which, as you may well imagine, the poor Souls catched at, and took Hold of very eagerly.&mdash;At length came a gorgeous Friar un|der a &s;plendid Canopy, bearing in his Hand a Piece of the Holy Cro&s;s.&mdash;After him followed two more little winged Boys, and then a long Train of fat and well-favoured <HI>Fran|ci&s;cans</HI> with their <HI>Calceis Fene&s;tratis,</HI> as <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> calls them; and &s;o the Proce&s;&s;ion ended. Methinks I hear you &s;ay, it is full Time&mdash;And &s;o &s;ay I&mdash;For as the Sight it&s;elf di&s;gu&s;ted me, &s;o I am per&s;uaded the bare Narration of it, though ever &s;o &s;hort, cannot be very plea&s;ant to you, who I know abhor every Thing that &s;avours of Super&s;tition and Idolatry.&mdash;We

will therefore take our Leave of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> who&s;e Proce&s;&s;ion was in the Day Time; but I mu&s;t tell you it is only to in|form you of another of a much more awful and &s;hocking Na|ture, which I &s;aw afterwards by Night.&mdash;It was about Ten o'Clock, when being deeply engaged in Conver&s;ation with my kind Ho&s;t, in came an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and told me in all Ha&s;te, that he had &s;een a Train of near two hundred Penitents pa&s;|&s;ing along, and that in all Probability I might be gratified with the &s;ame Sight, if I ha&s;tened to a Place whither he would conduct me.&mdash;I very readily obey'd the Summons, and, as Curio&s;ity quickened my Pace, we &s;oon came up with &s;ome of tho&s;e poor Creatures, who were then making a Halt, and kneeling in the Street, whil&s;t a Friar from a high Cro&s;s, with an Image of our LORD Crucified in his Hand, was preach|ing to them, and the Populace, with great Vehemence.&mdash;Sermon being ended, the Penitents, who had already been preached to, went forwards, and &s;everal Companies followed after with their re&s;pective preaching Friars at their Head bear|ing Crucifixes.&mdash;The&s;e they pointed to and brandi&s;hed fre|quently, and the Hearers as frequently beat their Brea&s;ts and clap'd their Cheeks&mdash;At proper Pau&s;es they &s;topped and prayed; and one of them, more zealous than the re&s;t, before the King's Palace, &s;ounded out the Word <HI>Penitentia</HI> through a &s;peaking Trumpet.&mdash;The Penitents them&s;elves were clo|thed and covered all over with white linen Ve&s;tments, only Holes were made for their Eyes to peep out at.&mdash;All were barefooted, and all had long heavy Chains fa&s;tened to their Ancles, which, when dragg'd along the Street, made a di&s;mal rattling: But though alike in Dre&s;s, yet in other Re&s;pects there was great Variety among&s;t them&mdash;For &s;ome carried great Stones on their Backs, and others dead Mens Bones and Skulls in their Hands.&mdash;Some bore large and &s;eemingly very heavy Cro&s;&s;es upon their Shoulders, whil&s;t others had their Arms extended quite wide, or carried a Bow full of Swords with the Points downwards&mdash;Mo&s;t of them whipped and la&s;hed them&s;elves, &s;ome with Cords, and others with flat Bits of Iron&mdash;It being a Moon&s;hine Night, I could &s;ee them quite

Pardon me, my dear Friend, I &s;top to weep&mdash;Adieu&mdash;I cannot enlarge, but leav|ing you to gue&s;s from what Source my Tears flow, I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<P>_PRovidence &s;till detains us at <HI>Li&s;bon,</HI> and therefore I know you will be enquiring what more News from thence?&mdash;Truly, as extraordinary as ever&mdash;For I have now &s;een the Solemnities of a <HI>Holy Thur&s;day,</HI> which is a very high Day in this Metropolis, and particularly remarkable for the grand Illuminations of the Churches, and the King's wa&s;hing twelve poor Mens Feet.&mdash;Through the Intere&s;t of a Friend I got Admittance into the Gallery where the Ceremony was performed.&mdash;It was large, and hung with Tape&s;try; one Piece of which repre&s;ented the humble <HI>Je&s;us</HI> wa&s;hing the Feet of his Di&s;ciples.&mdash;Before this, upon a &s;mall Eminence, &s;at twelve Men in black.&mdash;At the upper End, and &s;everal other Parts of the Gallery, were Sideboards of Gold and Silver large Ba&s;ons and Ewers mo&s;t curiou&s;ly wrought; and near the&s;e a large Table covered with a Variety of Di&s;hes, all cold, &s;et off and garni&s;hed after the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Fa&s;hion.&mdash;Publick high Ma&s;s being over, his Maje&s;ty came in, attended with his Nobles, who &s;eemed to me to look like &s;o many <HI>Roman</HI> Senators.&mdash;The very Act of wa&s;hing the Feet, I did not get in time enough to &s;ee; but that being ended, &s;everal of the young Noblemen &s;erved up the Di&s;hes to the King's Brother and Uncles; The&s;e again handed them to his Maje&s;ty, who gave (I think) twelve of them in all to each poor Man.&mdash;Every thing was carried on with a great deal of Decency and good Humour.&mdash;The young Noblemen &s;erved very chearfully, their Seniors looked quite plea&s;ed, and the King and his royal Relations behaved in a very polite, ea&s;y manner.&mdash;Upon the whole, though, as you may ea&s;ily gue&s;s, it was not an exact Copy of the Ta|pe&s;try

yet, as the poor Mens Cloaths and Food, when &s;old, came to about ten Moidores, and as there was little Mixture of Super&s;tition in it, I cannot &s;ay but I was as well plea&s;ed with my Morning's Entertainment as with any Thing I had met with &s;ince my Arrival.&mdash;I believe the whole took up near two Hours.&mdash;After Dinner we went to &s;ee the Chur|ches; but the Magnificence and Sumptuou&s;ne&s;s of the Furni|ture, on this Occa&s;ion, cannot well be expre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;Many of them were hung with purple Dama&s;k trimmed with Gold.&mdash;In one of them there was a &s;olid &s;ilver Altar of &s;everal Yards Circumference, and near twelve Steps high: And in another a gold one, &s;till more magnificent, of about the &s;ame Dimen|&s;ions.&mdash;Its Ba&s;is was &s;tudded with many precious Stones, and near the Top were placed &s;ilver Images, in Repre&s;entation of Angels.&mdash;Each Step was filled with large &s;ilver Candle|&s;ticks, with Wax-tapers in them, which, going up by a regu|lar A&s;cent 'till they formed them&s;elves into a Pyramid, made a mo&s;t glittering and &s;plendid Blaze&mdash;The great Altars al&s;o of the other Churches were illuminated mo&s;t profu&s;ely, and &s;ilver Pots of artificial Flowers, with a large Wax-taper be|tween each, were fixed all round &s;everal of them&mdash;Between the&s;e were large Paintings in black and white, repre&s;enting the different Parts of our Saviour's Pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;And, in &s;hort, all was &s;o magnificently, &s;o &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly grand, that I am per&s;uaded &s;everal Thou&s;ands of Pounds would not defray the Expences of this one Day&mdash;Go which Way you would, nothing was to be &s;een but Illuminations within, and Hurry without&mdash;For all Per&s;ons, the Crowned Heads them&s;elves not excepted, are obliged on this Day to vi&s;it &s;even Churches or Altars, in Imitation, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, of our LORD's being hurried from one Tribunal to another, before he was con|demned to be hung upon the Cro&s;s&mdash;I &s;aw the Queen pa&s;s by in great State to vi&s;it three of them&mdash;Velvet Cu&s;hions were carried before her Maje&s;ty, and Boards laid along the Streets for Her&s;elf and Retinue to walk upon&mdash;Guards at|tended before and behind, and Thou&s;ands of Spectators &s;tood on each Side to gaze at them as they pa&s;&s;ed along&mdash;Being de|&s;irous

<SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AFTER the News &s;ent you in my la&s;t, I thought our <HI>Li&s;bon</HI> Corre&s;pondence would entirely have been put a Stop to.&mdash;For upon returning to my Lodgings, (as weary I believe as others that had been running from Church to Church all Day) Word was &s;ent me, that our Ship would certainly &s;ail next Morning.&mdash;This News, I own, was not altogether agreeable to me, be|cau&s;e I wanted to &s;ee the Conclu&s;ion of the <HI>Lent</HI> Solemni|ties.&mdash;However, I made ready; and having di&s;patched my private Affairs the Over-night, was conducted very early in the Morning, by my kind Ho&s;t, down to <HI>Bellem,</HI> where the Ship lay.&mdash;We parted.&mdash;The Wind promi&s;ed to be fair; but dying away, I very eagerly went a&s;hore once more.&mdash;But how was the Scene changed; Before, all u&s;ed to be Noi&s;e and Hurry&mdash;Now, all was hu&s;hed and &s;hut up in the mo&s;t awful and profound Silence.&mdash;No Clock or Bell had been heard &s;ince Ye&s;terday Noon, and &s;carce a Per&s;on was to be &s;een in the Street all the way to <HI>Li&s;bon.</HI>&mdash;About Two in the Afternoon we got to the Place where (I had heard &s;ome Days ago) an extraordinary Scene was to be exhibited&mdash;Can you gue&s;s what it was?&mdash;Perhaps not.&mdash;Why then I will tell you.&mdash;<Q><HI>It was the Crucifixion of the Son of God, repre&s;ented partly by dumb Images, and partly by living Per&s;ons, in a

We had not waited long before the Curtain was drawn up.&mdash;Immediately, upon a high Scaffold, hung in the Front with black Bays, and behind with &s;ilk purple Dama&s;k laced with Gold, was exhibited to our View an Image of the LORD JESUS at full Length, crowned with Thorns, and nailed on a Cro&s;s, between two Figures of like Dimen&s;ions, repre|&s;enting the two Thieves&mdash;At a little Di&s;tance, on the right Hand, was placed an Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> in plain long Ruffles, and a kind of Widow-weeds&mdash;Her Veil was purple Silk, and &s;he had a wire Glory round her Head&mdash;At the Foot of the Cro&s;s lay, in a mournful pen&s;ive Po&s;ture, a living Man, dre&s;&s;ed in Woman's Cloaths, who per&s;onated <HI>Mary Magda|len;</HI> and not far off &s;tood a young Man, in Imitation of the beloved Di&s;ciple&mdash;He was dre&s;&s;ed in a loo&s;e green &s;ilk Ve&s;|ture, and Bob-wig&mdash;His Eyes were fixed on the Cro&s;s, and his two Hands a little extended&mdash;On each Side, near the Front of the State, &s;tood two Centinels in Buff, with formida|ble Caps and long Beards; and directly in the Front &s;tood another yet more formidable, with a large Target in his Hand&mdash;We may &s;uppo&s;e him to be the <HI>Roman</HI> Centurion&mdash;To compleat the Scene, from behind the purple Hangings came out about twenty little purple-ve&s;ted winged Boys, two by two, each bearing a lighted Wax-taper in his Hand, and a Crim&s;on and Gold Cap on his Head&mdash;At their Entrance upon the Stage they gently bowed their Heads to the Specta|tors, then kneeled and made Obey&s;ance, fir&s;t to the Image on the Cro&s;s, and then to that of the Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI>&mdash;When ri&s;en, they bowed to each other, and then took their re&s;pective Places over-again&s;t one another, on Steps a&s;&s;igned for them at the Front of the Stage&mdash;Oppo&s;ite to this, at a few Yards di&s;tance, &s;tood a black Friar, in a Pulpit hung in Mourning&mdash;For a

Determined to &s;ee the whole, I waited its Return, and in about a quarter of an Hour the Corps was brought in, and depo&s;ited in an open Sepulchre prepared for the Purpo&s;e; but not before a Prie&s;t, accompanied by &s;everal of the &s;ame Order in &s;plendid Ve&s;t|ments, had perfumed it with Incen&s;e, &s;ung to and kneeled be|fore it&mdash;<HI>John</HI> and <HI>Magdalen</HI> attended the Ob&s;equies; but the Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was carried away and placed upon the Front of the Stage, in order to be ki&s;s'd, ador'd, and wor&s;hipped by the People&mdash;This I &s;aw them do with the ut|mo&s;t Eargerne&s;s and Reverence&mdash;And thus ended this <HI>Good Friday'</HI>s Tragi-comical, &s;uper&s;titious, idolatrous <HI>Droll</HI>&mdash;A <HI>Droll,</HI> which whil&s;t I &s;aw, as well as now whil&s;t I am de&s;crib|ing it, excited in me a high Indignation&mdash;Surely thought I, whil&s;t attending on &s;uch a Scene of mock Devotion, if ever, now is the dear Lord Je&s;us crucified afre&s;h; and I could then, and even now, think of no other Plea for the poor beguiled De|votees, than that which &s;uffering Innocence put up him&s;elf for his Enemies, when actually hanging upon the Cro&s;s, viz.

all Probability you have heard hath actually been done in other Places, and with a little more Art, might, I think, have been performed here&mdash;Doubtle&s;s it would have afforded the Preacher as good, if not a better Opportunity of working upon the Pa&s;&s;ions of his Auditory, than the taking down the Super|&s;cription and Crown of Thorns, and wiping the Head with a blooded Cloth, and afterwards expo&s;ing it to the View of the People; all which I &s;aw done before the Body was let down.&mdash;But alas! my dear Friend, how mean is that Eloquence, and how entirely de&s;titute of the Demon&s;tration of the Spirit, and of a divine Power, mu&s;t that Oratory nece&s;&s;arily be, that &s;tands in need of &s;uch a Train of &s;uper&s;titious Pageantry to render it impre&s;&s;ive!&mdash;Think you, my dear Friend, that the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> u&s;ed or needed any &s;uch Artifices to excite the Pa&s;&s;ions of the People of <HI>Galatia,</HI> among&s;t whom, as he him&s;elf in|forms, us, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t was crucified, and evidently &s;et forth?</HI> But thus it is, and thus it will be, when Simplicity and Spirituality are bani&s;hed from our religious Offices, and Artifice and Ido|latry &s;eated in their Room&mdash;I am well aware that the <HI>Ro|mani&s;ts</HI> deny the Charge of Idolatry; but after having &s;een what I have &s;een this Day, as well as at &s;undry other Times &s;ince my Arrival here, I cannot help thinking but a Per&s;on mu&s;t be capable of making more than metaphy&s;ical Di&s;tinctions, and deal in very ab&s;tract Ideas indeed, fairly to evade the Charge&mdash;If <HI>weighed in the Balance of the Sanctuary,</HI> I am po&s;itive the Scale mu&s;t turn on the Prote&s;tant Side&mdash;But &s;uch a Balance the&s;e poor People are not permitted to make U&s;e of!
