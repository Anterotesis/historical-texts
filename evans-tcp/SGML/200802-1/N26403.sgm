<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE favourable reception given to the fir&s;t attempt at &s;omething like a REGISTER for the Year 1800, has induced the Editor to lay before the Public a volume more enlarged, and rather more methodical in its ar|rangement&mdash;but he does not expect that to give com|plete &s;atisfaction to others, when he him&s;elf is con&s;ci|ous of its defects. Among&s;t many inconveniences with which he has had to contend, was much ill health, both in his own per&s;on, and in tho&s;e of his workmen&mdash;This, with his di&s;tance from any ready help, and the difficulty he found in obtaining the nece&s;&s;ary intelligence, have prevented its appearance in the month of January, as he wi&s;hed and expected.</P>
<P>But as every misfortune is &s;aid to bring along with it &s;ome alleviating circum&s;tances, the book, in fact, has gained by the accidental delay. The Editor has had an opportunity of in&s;erting &s;everal important articles relative to the late Election of a Pre&s;ident, which other|wi&s;e would have been defered till next volume&mdash;indeed he could not with any propriety pa&s;s over a tran&s;action which &s;o highly intere&s;ted the feelings of the new, and attracted the &s;erious attention of the old world&mdash;
<Q><L>"When the &s;word hung &s;u&s;pended by a hair."</L></Q></P>
<P>If &s;mall matters may be compared to great, in order to &s;hew our Readers the nature of the work, the En|gli&s;h Annual Regi&s;ter for the year 1799 was not publi&s;h|ed in September la&s;t&mdash;As a Record of <HI>what is pa&s;t,</HI> it is not nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould appear exactly on the fir&s;t day of the new year like an Almanack&mdash;And it may ea|&s;ily be imagined, that it takes &s;ome time and trouble to arrange and prepare materials even for &s;o &s;mall a work as the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In the arrangement of the materials which compo&s;e this little volume, it was the Editor's object to combine hi&s;torical in&s;truction, with a collection of the local events and occurrences of the year. His hi&s;torical ex|tracts
<PB N="ii" REF="035113_0004_1000BE1F6C630980">
are taken from the be&s;t authorities, and are in|&s;erted with a view, that the people of this country might thereby form a judgement of the nature of the corrupt-and-tottering Governments of Europe, and learn from them, to appreciate the advantages which they enjoy; and taking example from the awful &s;cenes now acting in that part of the world, to cheri&s;h and &s;upport a form of Government founded on the princi|ples of ju&s;tice and natural right.</P>
<P>On a review of the materials which he had collected, he perceived that he had as many as would make a very thick Octavo volume, all of them, in his opinion, worthy of pre&s;ervation, either for u&s;e or entertain|ment&mdash;His chief labour, therefore, has been, to re|ject a great many of the&s;e articles, and &s;o to contract and compre&s;s others, as to bring them into &s;uch a com|pa&s;s as he thought would fit the &s;ize of his book, and enable him to &s;ell it at a moderate price.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that the Editor had in contempla|tion a publication &s;imilar to the Engli&s;h Annual Re|gi&s;ter, in which &s;hould be recorded the principal Acts of both the General and State Governments, the Nation|al Accounts, &amp;c.&mdash;to in&s;ert every article tending to en|courage Agriculture, Commerce, and Manufactures, all u&s;eful inventions and, di&s;coveries, the mo&s;t remark|able occurrences of the year, &amp;c. the&s;e to be enlivened with choice Poetry, remarks on new Publications, and hi&s;torical extracts and details.</P>
<P>Such a work, if executed with calmne&s;s and impar|tiality, it is evident, would be both a u&s;eful and enter|taining publication&mdash;Several Gentlemen, who are of this opinion, and who wi&s;h &s;uch a &s;cheme carried into execution, have &s;ugge&s;ted to the Editor, either to pub|li&s;h a large volume annually, or a &s;maller one half|yearly&mdash;Either way, for &s;uch a work, there would be an abundance of materials, in an age when every week, almo&s;t every day, produces &s;omething new and wonderful.</P>
<P>Whether this idea will be carried into execution, will depend on certain concurring circum&s;tances, and upon the reception which the pre&s;ent volume &s;hall receive. Late as it is in its appearance, and imperfect as it may

&s;eem to tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to con&s;ult that ju&s;tly admired work publi&s;hed in London,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Altho' the Annual Regi&s;ter, by the re&s;trictions laid upon the Pre&s;s in England, has lately been obliged to omit, or very &s;lightly notice, certain political &s;ubjects and events, and altho' it contains many articles that are unintere&s;ting to an American reader, yet, the importance of its hi&s;torical chapters, and the number of curious and literary articles which it annually pre|&s;ents to view, renders it a work highly u&s;eful in a Gentleman's library.</NOTE> the Editor hopes that the unavoidable cau&s;es of its delay will plead his excu&s;e; and that the local u&s;efulne&s;s of the articles which it contains, will recommend it to the notice of a di&s;cerning public.</P>
<P>In the following pages, two leading principles are meant to be openly and decidedly inculcated&mdash;namely, the importance of a religious and moral conduct; and, the &s;uperior excellence of a Republican form of Go|vernment.</P>
<P>The Editor thinks it right at once to di&s;play his colours, and avowedly to declare his &s;entiments&mdash;in order, that tho&s;e who expect to find other principles in this book, by reading the&s;e few lines, may &s;ave both their time and their money.</P>
<P>In what is now called "the Age of Rea&s;on," a <HI>Cen|&s;or Morum</HI> is but an unthankful office. The man who only talks of Religion, &s;ubjects him&s;elf to the charge of hypocri&s;y; and if he attempts to inculcate it, he is accu&s;ed of pre&s;umption&mdash;On this &s;ubject, therefore, the Editor will be very conci&s;e&mdash;In a few words, he would humbly plead the cau&s;e of that belief in, and reliance on, the goodne&s;s and providence of an all-&s;eeing, all-directing Deity, which gives dignity to the individual, and &s;afety to the community;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The following anecdote is related of Dr. Franklin, who&s;e bu&s;t, long ago, &s;hould have filled one of the vacant niches in the Capitol at Richmond:&mdash;A young man, one of the <HI>new</HI> Philo&s;o|phy, after pouring out a number of flippant remarks deroga|tory of all religion, turned to the Dr. with a look of &s;elf-ap|probation, and a&s;k'd his opinion?&mdash;<HI>It is be&s;t to believe,</HI> &s;aid the Philo&s;opher&mdash;The opinion of this truly great man, after the experience of 80 years, &s;hould outweigh the ha&s;ty, ill-judg'd a&s;|&s;ertions of a million of pretenders to philo&s;ophy.</NOTE> which is a balm of com|fort to the poor, and is a check and controul on the

rich&mdash;If the word of one who has &s;een and felt much of the world could obtain any credit, he would a&s;&s;ure his readers, that the man, the family, the community, or the nation, who ob&s;erves a religious and moral con|duct, will, eventually, be found not only the mo&s;t happy, but al&s;o the mo&s;t pro&s;perous.</P>
<P>But he does not plead for <HI>political</HI> Religion&mdash;<HI>that</HI> kind of religion which has exalted Kings, and Popes, and Cardinals, and Dignitaries to high places, to riot on the hard earnings of a deluded people, and which, more than all the writings of Ath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ts and Infidels, has de|pre&s;&s;ed, and almo&s;t annihilated, <HI>true</HI> religion&mdash;<HI>that</HI> re|ligion, which the Kings and De&s;pots of Europe, at the expence of &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure, are &s;till en|deavouring to &s;upport&mdash;<HI>that</HI> religion, called the Pro|te&s;tant, which the Engli&s;h, in the war of 1756, &s;pent &s;o many millions to protect&mdash;nor <HI>that</HI> religion, the Pop|i&s;h, which the &s;ame nation, in the war of 1793, has expended &s;o many more millions to re&s;tore!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Neither Prote&s;tant nor Papi&s;t!&mdash;Of what religion are you then?"&mdash;Look, my friend, into the 5th and 6th chapters of Mathew, and behold the &s;imple, unadulterated tenets of the <HI>true</HI> Religion.</NOTE></P>
<P>In this country, and in the&s;e teeming times, it is impo&s;&s;ible for any Writer, or Editor, to avoid Politics,&mdash;Indeed, that man mu&s;t have a cold heart, or an emp|ty head, who can look on unmoved by what is now pa&s;&s;ing in the world. Every man has his bias; and every man who beholds the wonderful changes tak|ing place in opinions, in &s;y&s;tems, and in empires, mu&s;t be affected. Whether the Editor has &s;ubjected <HI>his</HI> bias to the dictates of candour and impartiality, at|lea&s;t, to the rules of decency and good manners, the Public&mdash;the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Public&mdash;will pronounce.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">With every good American, it mu&s;t be cau&s;e of vexation, to ob&s;erve the unbounded abu&s;e and illiberality which daily pour from many of the pre&s;&s;es on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion&mdash;One would think, that Peter Porcupine had &s;pread his poi&s;onous mantle over the whole continent, and infected the general ma&s;s!&mdash;&s;uch extravagant licentiou&s;ne&s;s, if it does not tend finally to annihilate the Liberty of the Pre&s;s, as it has done in Europe, mu&s;t at lea&s;t greatly imbitter its &s;weets.</NOTE></P>

To a plain, unprejudiced, un|&s;ophi&s;ticated under&s;tanding, can there be a doubt whe|ther one man &s;hould rule a million by his mere will and plea&s;ure, or, that the million &s;hould govern them&s;elves upon the principles of equity and ju&s;tice?&mdash;There would not, but for ignorance on one &s;ide, and cunning on the other.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What a degrading picture does the hi&s;tory of the world pre&s;ent to our a&s;toni&s;hed view&mdash;a very &s;mall proportion of man|kind, who were knaves, deceiving and domineering over all the re&s;t, who were fools!&mdash;The <HI>new</HI> Philo&s;ophers &s;ay they will mend this matter&mdash;Yes, that they will&mdash;when Godwin e&s;|tabli&s;hes the <HI>perfectability of human nature!</HI></NOTE> In a word, whether a Kingly or a Re|publican form of Government is the mo&s;t eligible, the mo&s;t rational, and the mo&s;t conducive to the happine&s;s of the people?</P>

But all cannot be of one opinion; diver&s;ity is the or|der of Nature. It is to be acknowledged, that there are good men who adopt the monarchical &s;y&s;tem mere|ly upon principle; and &s;uch men are entitled to our re&s;pect, however they may differ from us in &s;entiment&mdash;But the greate&s;t misfortune to the cau&s;e of Liberty is, that many men, particularly tho&s;e of property, take refuge under the wings of Kingly power, di&s;gu&s;ted with the tumults and di&s;orders of Democracy. This is a rock which the Americans, in the navigating of their political bark, would do well to avoid&mdash;it is the more dangerous, becau&s;e it is a popular one. <HI>Demo|cracy,</HI> or the Will of the People, is unque&s;tionably the fir&s;t principle and ground-work of the American Con|&s;titution; but, as &s;oon as the people have fulfilled their grand, ine&s;timable privilege of chu&s;ing their Repre|&s;entatives, then it becomes <HI>Republicani&s;m,</HI> or a &s;y&s;tem marked and bounded by certain known and definite re|gulations. The Democracy here deprecated, con&s;i&s;ts in a confu&s;ion of &s;y&s;tem, of ill-timed interferences of one body with another, and of violent and unnece&s;&s;ary exertions of the people, &amp;c.&mdash;It is <HI>this</HI> Democracy, that is kindled and enflamed by cunning and ambitious men, who fir&s;t rai&s;e them&s;elves on the &s;houlders of the mob, and then trample on their rights, under the pretext of re&s;toring order and good government&mdash;It is <HI>this</HI> Demo|cracy, that, &s;ooner than any other, will become a prime engine in the hands of <HI>foreign</HI> emi&s;&s;aries, fir&s;t to divide the people, and then reduce them to <HI>foreign</HI> obedience.</P>
<P>One would think that the geographical &s;ituation of the American States would keep them clear of that de|&s;tructive and all-devouring vortex, European politics, and that an ocean 3000 miles broad, would protect them from in&s;ult and danger. Of what import, it may be a&s;ked, is it to the nations of Europe, whether John Adams or Thomas Jeffer&s;on pre&s;ides at the head of the American government?&mdash;The Connecticut preten&s;ious can neither open nor &s;hut the Scheldt; nor can the Georgia claims either ob&s;truct or facilitate the naviga|tion of the Baltic&mdash;But it is the baneful nature of the Kingly &s;y&s;tem ever to intermeddle with the affairs of other nations&mdash;The hi&s;tory of Europe is full of it&mdash;A|mong&s;t innumerable in&s;tances &s;uffice it to mention, that

<P>Un&s;hackled by a Monarchy, a Nobility, and an Hier|archy, America, at pre&s;ent, is divided between two great intere&s;ts, the Agricultural and Commercial.&mdash;Agriculture and Commerce are &s;aid to be intimately allied, and to depend on the mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance of each other&mdash;We believe they do&mdash;but the latter &s;hould al|ways be &s;ubordinate to the former. In that country where agriculture predominates, the people will have the be&s;t chance of maintaining their independence&mdash;where the latter prevails, they will &s;ink, by rapid &s;teps, into a &s;tate of luxury, venality, and &s;ubjection.</P>

<HEAD>FROM THE LIFE OF VOLTAIRE.</HEAD>
<P>TIRED of the lazy and &s;ycophantic life which I was obliged to lead at Paris, and meeting with a young lady who happened to think nearly as I did, in the year 1733, we took the re&s;olution to go and &s;pend &s;ome years in the country, there, far from the tumult and corruption of Courts, to culti|vate her under&s;tanding, and increa&s;e her knowledge.</P>
<P>This lady was the Marchione&s;s de Chatelet, who, of all the women in France, had a mind the mo&s;t capable of all the branches of Science. Her fa|ther, the Baron de Breteuil, had taught her Latin, which &s;he under&s;tood perfectly; &s;he knew, by ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, the mo&s;t beautiful pa&s;&s;ages in Virgil, Horace, and Lucr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tius, and all the writings of Cicero were fa|miliar to her. Seldom has there been united in the &s;ame per&s;on, &s;o much ju&s;tne&s;s of di&s;cernment and elegance of ta&s;te, joined to &s;o ardent a de&s;ire for information.</P>
<P>At Cirey, on the borders of Champagne, we &s;ought only in&s;truction, and troubled not our&s;elves with the follies of the world&mdash;but, after having &s;pent &s;ix years in our retreat, we were obliged to go to Bru&s;&s;els, where the family of the Chatelets had long been embroiled in a law-&s;uit with the fa|mily of the Honbrooks. I had the plea&s;ure of ter|minating the law-&s;uit, by which the two families had been ruining each other with law expences for &s;ixty years, and, by an amicable accommodation, I

gained 226,000 livres in ready money to the Mar|quis du Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</P>
<P>While at Bru&s;&s;els, in the year 1740, the iron|hearted Frederick William, the unpoli&s;hed King of Pru&s;&s;ia, died at Berlin. His &s;on, who has &s;ince gained &s;o &s;ingular a reputation, had held a regular corre&s;pondence with me &s;everal years. The world never, perhaps, beheld a father and &s;on who le&s;s re|&s;embled each other than the&s;e two Monarchs.</P>
<P>The father was an ab&s;olute Goth, a Vandal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> who thought of no other thing, during his whole reign, than ama&s;&s;ing money, and maintaining, at the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible expence, the fine&s;t army in Europe. Never were &s;ubjects poorer, or King more rich. He bought up, at a low price, the e&s;tates of a great part of his Nobility, who &s;oon devoured the little money they got for them, mo&s;t of which returned to the Royal coffers by means of heavy taxes. All the King's lands were farmed out to tax-gatherers, who held the double office of Judge and Exci&s;eman; in&s;omuch, that if a tenant did not pay on the very day appoint|ed, he put on his Judge's robe, and condemned the poor delinquent to pay double the &s;um. It mu&s;t al&s;o be ob&s;erved, that if this &s;ame Exci&s;eman did not pay by the la&s;t day of the month, the day following he was him&s;elf obliged to pay treble to the King!</P>
<P>Did a man kill a hare, or lop a tree, or any other trifling offence, he was in&s;tantly condemned to pay a fine to the King&mdash;Money! Money!&mdash;Was a poor, deluded girl found guilty of making a child, the fa|ther, or the mother, or &s;ome other relation, was obliged to pay a &s;um of money to his Maje&s;ty!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the <HI>great</HI> Frederick as he is &s;ometimes called, pur&s;ued a different &s;y&s;tem&mdash;He did not care how ma|ny children were gotten in his dominions, nor after what fa&s;hion, provided he got &s;oldiers enough&mdash;The virtue of cha&s;tity was not in very high repute with his Maje&s;ty.&mdash;See Moore and other travellers.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Harone&s;s of Kniphau&s;en, who at that time, was the riche&s;t widow in Berlin, that is to &s;ay, &s;he had between 3 and 400l. a year, was accu&s;ed of hav|ing

made a child clande&s;tinely in the &s;econd year of her widowhood. His Maje&s;ty was graciou&s;ly plea&s;|ed to write her a letter with his own Royal hand, informing her, that it was nece&s;&s;ary, if &s;he mount to pre&s;erve her character, to &s;end him 30,000 livres, (1250l.)&mdash;She was obliged to borrow the &s;um, and was ruined!</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty had an Amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, who&s;e name was Lu&s;ius; and certainly of all the Amba&s;&s;adors that ever appertained to Royalty, he was paid the wor&s;t. This poor man, that he might be able to keep a fire, had cut down &s;ome bu&s;hes in the Royal domain. His next di&s;patches brought him word, that the King, his gracious Sovereign, had mulcted him a year's &s;alary; and Lu&s;ius, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it of de&s;pair, cut his throat with the only razor he had!&mdash;An old valet unhappily &s;aved his life&mdash;I afterwards met his Excellency at the Hague, and gave him alms at the gate of the Palace, where this wretched Am|ba&s;&s;ador had formerly lived.</P>
<P>It was by &s;uch means that he acquired 120 milli|ons of crowns (15 millions &s;terling) all ca&s;ked up in barrels, hoop'd with iron, end depo&s;ited in double vaulted cellars.</P>
<P>This Monarch u&s;ed to walk from his palace cloth|ed in an old blue coat, with large copper buttons half way down his thighs, and when he bought a new one, which was but &s;eldom, the&s;e buttons were made to &s;erve again. It was in this dre&s;s, with a large ru&s;ty hat and patch'd boots, and armed with a huge cane, that his Maje&s;ty &s;allied forth every day to review his regiment of giants. The&s;e giants were his greate&s;t delight, and for whom he went to the heavie&s;t expence. The men who &s;tood in the front rank were none of them le&s;s than 7 feet high, and he &s;ent to purcha&s;e them from every part of Europe. They were after wards made Heiduques by the new King to attend the Queen's coach. As they walked on each &s;ide of an old ill &s;hapen coach, in order to keep it from falling, the&s;e Heiduques could &s;hake hands with each other over the roof.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="035113_0018_1000BE3B6E2A15B0">
After his Maje&s;ty had been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to review his giants, he u&s;ed to walk thro' the town, when every body fled from before him. If he hap|pened to meet a woman, he &s;ternly demanded, why &s;he &s;taid idling her time in the &s;treets&mdash;"Get home, ye lazy b&mdash;h! an hone&s;t woman has no bu&s;ine&s;s o|ver the thre&s;hold of her own door"&mdash;which words he would accompany with a box on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar, a kick on the b&mdash;&s;ide, or &s;ome &s;trokes on the &s;houlders with his huge cane!&mdash;Nor did this gracious Monarch treat the holy Mini&s;ters of Religion in a more gentle &s;tile, if ever he caught them wandering near to his parade.&mdash;The bare &s;ight of his cane was more terrifying to them, than the &s;ound of the Inqui&s;ition is to an unprotected heretic!</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Turkey is a Republic when compared to the de&s;poti&s;m exerci&s;ed by Frederick William of Pru&s;&s;ia!</P>
<P>We may ea&s;ily imagine, what would be the wrath of a Vandal like this, to find he had a &s;on endowed with wit, &s;en&s;e, and good breeding; who was eager in the acqui&s;ition of knowledge, who made ver&s;es, and afterwards &s;et them to mu&s;ic. If his Maje&s;ty caught his &s;on with a book in his hand, he rudely took it from him, and threw it into the fire; or playing on the flute, he broke it into pieces; and he often treated the Prince as he did the unfortunate women and preachers when he caught them near to his parade.</P>
<P>The Prince, at length weary of the attentions of &s;o <HI>kind</HI> a father, determined to elope, without well knowing whether to fly, to France or to England&mdash;His father's economy deprived him of the power of travelling even in the &s;tile of an Engli&s;h trade&s;man, and he was obliged to borrow a &s;mall &s;um of money.&mdash;Two young gentlemen, both very amiable, were to accompany him. One named Kat, the only &s;on of a brave Officer; the other Keit, who had mar|ried the daughter of the Barone&s;s Kniphau&s;en, who had to pay 30,000 livres for making a child without his Maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion, as before mentioned. The

day and hour were appointed; but the jealous Mon|arch getting intelligence of the affair, the Prince and his two companions were arre&s;ted, and &s;ent to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, the King believed that the Prince&s;s Wil|helmina, his daughter, was concerned in the plot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and as he was remarkable for di&s;patch in the exe|cutive branch of ju&s;tice, he in&s;tantly proceeded to kick her out of a large window, which reached from the floor to the cieling. The Queen Mother, who happened to be pre&s;ent at this kingly exploit, with great difficulty &s;aved her daughter, by catching hold of her petticoats at the moment &s;he was going out of the window. The Prince&s;s received a violent con|fu&s;ion on her brea&s;t, the mark of which remained with her during life, and which &s;he did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the hon|our of &s;hewing &s;ome years afterwards.</P>
<P>The Prince had a &s;ort of mi&s;tre&s;s, the daughter of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter. This girl played tolerably well on the harp&s;ichord, and the Prince accompanied her with his flute; he thought he he was in love, but he was mi&s;taken&mdash;However, the King extended his Royal authority over this mi&s;guided girl, by cau&s;ing her to be paraded by the public hangman, and afterwards whip'd in the Prince's pre&s;ence!&mdash;His Maje&s;ty then &s;ent his &s;on to the citadel of Cu&s;trin, &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of an unwhole&s;ome mar&s;h; here he was clo&s;ely confined for &s;ix months, in a &s;ort of dungeon; at the end of which time, his Royal fa|ther was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to allow him a &s;oldier as an attendant.</P>
<P>This &s;oldier, who was young, hand&s;ome, and play|ed upon the flute, had more ways than one of arou&s;|ing the Prince&mdash;So many fine qualities made his for|tune; and I &s;ince knew him, at once Valet de Cham|bre and Prime Mini&s;ter, with all the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tne&s;s and in&s;olence which two &s;uch prime po&s;ts may be &s;up|po&s;ed to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Prince was in the citadel of Cu&s;trin, one morning an Officer entered his apartment weeping, accompanied by four grenadiers. Frederick had no

<P>Keit, the other confidant, had fled into Holland, whether the King di&s;patched his military me&s;&s;engers to &s;eize him. Luckily he e&s;caped by a minute, em|barked for Portugal, and there remained till the death of the mo&s;t tender-hearted Frederick William, King of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>But it was not his Maje&s;ty's intention to have &s;top|ped here; it was his de&s;ign to have beheaded the Prince al&s;o. He con&s;idered, that he had three other &s;ons, not one of whom wrote ver&s;es, or played on the flute, and that they were &s;ufficient to maintain the grandeur of the Pru&s;&s;ian throne.

<P>Well, at length Providence was plea&s;ed to take the iron-hearted Monarch to another world, and the Prince &s;ucceeded to the throne. He began his reign with a piece of wit.

his wi&s;h to &s;ee me at Bru&s;&s;els&mdash;Apartments were pre|pared for him in Chateau de Meu&s;e, where I went to wait upon his Maje&s;ty. One &s;oldier was the only guard I found&mdash;the Mini&s;ter of State, Rambonet, was walking in the court-yard, blowing his fingers; he had on a dirty &s;hirt with long dirty ruffles, an old hat all in holes, and an old judge's wig, one wing of which hung into his pocket, whil&s;t the other &s;carcely touched his &s;houlder.</P>
<P>I was conducted into his Maje&s;ty's apartment, in which I &s;aw nothing but four bare walls. By the light of a bougie, I perceived a &s;mall truckle-bed, in a &s;ort of clo&s;et, upon which lay a little thin man wrapped in a morning gown of blue cloth&mdash;It was his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, who lay &s;haking with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it of the ague under a beggarly coverlet. I made my bow, and began my acquaintance by feeling his pul&s;e as if I had been his fir&s;t phy&s;ician.&mdash;The ague left him, he aro&s;e, dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and &s;at down to ta|ble with Algarotti, Maupertius, the Amba&s;&s;ador, and my&s;elf, where, at &s;upper, we treated mo&s;t profound|ly on the immortality of the &s;oul, of natural liberty, and the Androgynes of Plato.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t we were thus philo&s;ophizing upon liberty, the Mini&s;ter Rambonet, mounted upon a po&s;t-hor&s;e, in his judge's wig, was riding all night towards Liege, at the gates of which, next day, he pro|claimed, with &s;ound of trumpet, the name of the King his ma&s;ter, whil&s;t 2000 &s;oldiers laid the city under contribution!&mdash;The pretext for this fine ex|ploit was, certain rights which his Maje&s;ty pretend|ed to have over a part of the &s;uburbs. The drawing up of the manife&s;to was committed to me, which I performed as well as the nature of the ca&s;e would let me&mdash;not &s;u&s;pecting that a King, with whom I had the honour of &s;upping, who called me his dear friend, and who talked &s;o beautifully of natural ju&s;|tice and the immortality of the &s;oul, could po&s;&s;ibly be in the wrong. The affair was &s;oon brought to a conclu&s;ion; the innocent people of Liege were oblig|ed to pay a million of livres in hard ca&s;h, which more

than defrayed his Maje&s;ty's expences cau&s;ed by his journey to &s;ee Stra&s;burgh, &amp;c</P>
<P>I &s;oon felt an attachment for him, as he had wit and an agreeable manner, and, moreover, he was a King, which is a &s;eduction &s;eldom vanqui&s;hed by human weakne&s;s. Generally, authors flatter Kings; but, in this in&s;tance, I was prai&s;ed by a King from the crown of my head to the &s;ole of my foot.</P>
<P>Some time before the death of his father, the Prince had written again&s;t the dete&s;table principles of Machiavel&mdash;but this was before he became a King, and whil&s;t his father gave him no great rea&s;on to ad|mire de&s;potic power. This manu&s;cript he had &s;ent to me at Bru&s;&s;els, to have it corrected and printed. With all my admiration for my kingly friend, I could not help feeling &s;ome remor&s;e at being concerned in printing this Anti-machiavelian book, at the very moment the Royal author, who had a hundred mil|lions in his cellars, was robbing the poor inhabitants of Liege of a million of livres!</P>
<P>I began to perceive, that my kingly friend would not &s;top here. His father had left him 70,000 well-di&s;ciplined troops; he was bu&s;ily augmenting them, and appeared to have a va&s;t inclination to give them employment the very fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>In the month of October 1740, the Emperor Char|les VI. died of an indige&s;tion cau&s;ed by eating cham|pignons, which brought on an apoplexy&mdash;and this plate of champignons occa&s;ioned the death of many thou&s;ands of brave men, and changed the order of things in Europe. It was &s;oon very evident, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was not &s;o great an enemy to Machiaveli&s;m as the Prince Royal!</P>
<P>He had already a&s;&s;embled his troops, yet none of his Mini&s;ters or Generals knew his de&s;igns. I had &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that he meant to quarrel with France; as, three months before, he had &s;ent to me a political di&s;&s;ertation, written in his manner, wherein he con&s;idered France as the natural enemy of Germany&mdash;But it was con&s;titutional in Frederick to do the very rever&s;e of what he &s;aid or wrote.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="035113_0024_1000BE46E89A4980">
He departed, on the 15th of December, for the conque&s;t of Sile&s;ia, at the head of 50,000 well di&s;|ciplined combatants. As the Queen of Bohemia was illy prepared to repel him, he &s;oon effected his pur|po&s;e. He wrote a hi&s;tory of that conque&s;t, which he &s;hewed to me&mdash;Here follows one of the para|graphs, which I carefully tran&s;cribed, as a thing worthy of recording:&mdash;</P>

<P>It is much to be regretted, that I prevailed upon him to omit the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, when I afterwards cor|rected his works. A confe&s;&s;ion &s;o uncommon &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed to po&s;terity, in order to &s;hew upon what principles Kings make war, and &s;hed the blood of their deluded &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>I now returned to Cirey, and afterwards pa&s;&s;ed the winter in Paris, where I had a multitude of ene|mies; for, having written the Hi&s;tory of Charles XII. pre&s;ented &s;everal &s;ucce&s;sful pieces to the thea|tre, and compo&s;ed an epic poem, I had, of cour&s;e, all tho&s;e who write either in bad ver&s;e or pro&s;e as my enemies&mdash;and, as I wrote likewi&s;e on philo&s;o|phic &s;ubjects, of nece&s;&s;ity, according to ancient cu&s;|tom, I was treated as an Athie&s;t by all Church bi|gots and devotees.</P>
<P>I was the fir&s;t who dared to develope to the people of France, in an intelligible &s;tyle, the di&s;coveries of the great Newton. I was likewi&s;e an admirer of Locke; I con&s;idered him as the only rea&s;onable me|taphy&s;ician. I prai&s;ed that moderation &s;o new, &s;o prudent, where he &s;ays, we have not &s;ufficient know|ledge to determine, by the light of rea&s;on, that God could not grant the gifts of thought and &s;en&s;ation to a being which we call material.&mdash;The poor creatures who were the mo&s;t forward and the hotte&s;t in this di&s;pute, knew very little of either matter or &s;pirit.</P>

The fact is, that none of us know what or how we are, except that we are convinced we have life, motion, and thought, but without the lea&s;t concep|tion of how we came by them.

<P>Whil&s;t the literary grubs of Paris were making war upon me, the King of France began to make war upon the Queen of Hungary upon principles e|qually iniquitous as tho&s;e of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia.&mdash;After having &s;olemnly guaranteed and &s;worn to the Pragmatic Sanction, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Maria There&s;a to the inheritance of her father, and after having received Lorraine as the purcha&s;e of the&s;e promi&s;es, it does not appear to be con&s;i&s;tent with the rights of nations, or the ideas of common ju&s;tice, to break &s;uch &s;acred engagements.</P>

<HEAD>FROM THE LIFE OF CATHERINE II.</HEAD>
<P>A Book has lately appeared, which has excited very general attention&mdash;it is entitled, "The Life of Catherine II. Em|pre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia." It not only developes much of the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of that extraordinary woman, in her private life and amours, but al&s;o di&s;covers a great deal of the political manoeuvres both of the Ru&s;&s;ian and other European Courts.&mdash;The importance of this publication may be judged of, by the uncommon demand for it in every country in Europe, and the extreme &s;olicitude which the Emperor Paul &s;hews to have it &s;uppre&s;&s;ed wherever his power, or influence, or authority, can reach. Be&s;ides the general hi&s;tory of the times, which were &s;ufficiently eventful and intere&s;ting, the book contains many curious anecdotes, not only of the Empre&s;s her&s;elf, but of many public characters which the ignorant and uniformed world were wont to reverence or e&s;teem&mdash;It exhibits, in bold and legible characters, the deep de&s;igns of Courts, and the treacherous venality of Courtiers&mdash;from a view of which, every hone&s;t American will be thankful to Providence for placing his country at &s;o great a di&s;tance from that bu&s;y, perturbed &s;cene, where a combination of Kings, and Politicians, and Generals, by their intrigues and their ambition, are daily mi&s;leading and oppre&s;&s;ing mankind.&mdash;In &s;hort, after a careful peru&s;al of the&s;e entertaining and in&s;tructive volumes, we are at a lo&s;s which mo&s;t to abhor the artful and cruel means by which Catherine a&s;cended and then kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Imperial throne, or to wonder at the &s;urpri&s;ing addre&s;s with which &s;he ruled her va&s;t Empire, whil&s;t &s;he guided, or agitated, or convul&s;ed, the politics of almo&s;t all Europe.</P>

THE book opens with a &s;uccinct account of oc|currences in the Court of Peter&s;burgh previous to the Revolution of 1762, when the unfortunate Peter III. (hu&s;band of Catherine II.) was dethroned and put to death&mdash;As this part of the hi&s;tory is too lengthy for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, we &s;elect for the attention of our Readers, the melancholy &s;tory of the Prince&s;s Tarrakanoff, daughter of the Empre&s;s Elizabeth, who became a victim, by the ba&s;e&s;t means, to the jealous and unrelenting policy of Catherine&mdash;Let it be remembered, that the treacherous agent in this in&s;iduous bu&s;ine&s;s, Alexius Orloff, was the prin|cipal murderer of the Emperor Peter&mdash;But we mu&s;t fir&s;t give &s;ome account of the Empre&s;s Eliza|beth&mdash;</P>
<P>Elizabeth Petrovna was the daughter of Peter the Great, and the fir&s;t Catherine, who was obliged, at her death, to leave the throne to the young Peter II. (in 1727) &s;on of the unfortunate Tzarovitch A|lexius, beheaded by order of his father.&mdash;Peter II, reigned only three years, and was followed by the Empre&s;s Anne, daughter of the Tzar Ivan, elder brother of the fir&s;t Peter.</P>
<P>To Anne, in 1740, &s;ucceeded her nephew Ivan the Third, yet in his cradle, and who, by a con&s;piracy headed by a German &s;urgeon named Le&s;tock, was dethroned, 13 months afterwards, in order to rai&s;e Elizabeth to the throne.</P>
<P>Elizabeth, it is &s;aid, had a re&s;emblance to her mo|ther, the hand&s;ome Catherine. But, if &s;he equalled her in tho&s;e advantages which render the &s;ociety of women &s;o agreeable, &s;he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed her in the immo|derate love of vicious plea&s;ure. In&s;tead of having the art of commanding, like her mother, Elizabeth &s;ubmitted her&s;elf to the guidance of others; and this weakne&s;s was the primary cau&s;e of the misfor|tunes of Peter III.</P>
<P>That &s;he might maintain her independence, Eliza|beth refu&s;ed to take a hu&s;band, with whom &s;he mu&s;t have &s;hared the empire; but &s;he did not the more

The two Counts Tarrakanoff and their &s;i&s;ter, were the fruit of this clande&s;tine union. Elizabeth, however, did not content her&s;elf with one lover; &s;he had frequent changes; but Razumou&s;ky permitted none to approach her, except &s;uch as he thought to have too little under&s;tanding, or ambition, to attempt a competition with him.</P>
<P>To her violent propen&s;ity to voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, Eliz|abeth added fir&s;t the love of good eating, and then the plea&s;ures of wine.

He <HI>&s;eemed</HI> very much affected at the &s;tate of de&s;titution in which he found her; he offered her &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which nece&s;&s;ity forced her to accept; and the traitor appeared to this unfortunate lady, as well as to the woman that waited on her, in the light of a &s;aviour, whom Heaven had &s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o her deliverance!</P>
<P>When this treacherous emi&s;&s;ary thought he had &s;ufficiently gained their confidence, he declared that he was commi&s;&s;ioned by Count Alexius Orloff to of|fer to the daughter of Elizabeth the throne that had been filled by her mother. He &s;aid, that the Ruffi|ans were di&s;contented with Catherine; that Orloff e&s;pecially could never forgive her for her ingratitude and her tyranny; and that, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the young Prince&s;s would accept of the &s;ervices of that General, and recompence him by the grant of her hand, it would not be long ere &s;he &s;aw the breaking out of that revolution which he had prepared.</P>

her the treachery of him that made them. But her inexperience and her candour permitted her not to &s;u&s;pect any guilt. Be&s;ides, the language of the em|i&s;&s;ary of Alexius Orloff &s;eemed analogous with the notions &s;he had imbibed from Prince Radzivil. She imagined her&s;elf de&s;tined to the throne; and all the airy dreams that any way related to that opinion could not but encourage the deceit. She according|ly gave her&s;elf up to the&s;e flattering hopes, and with a grateful heart, concurred in the de&s;igns of her treacherous advi&s;er, who "flatter'd but to de|&s;troy."</P>
<P>Some time after Alexius Orloff came to Rome. His emi&s;&s;ary had already announced him.&mdash;He was received as a benefactor.&mdash;However, &s;ome per&s;ons to whom the Prince&s;s and her gouvernante commu|nicated the good fortune that was promi&s;ed them, advi&s;ed them to be on their guard again&s;t the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> de|&s;igns of a man who&s;e character for wickedne&s;s had been long e&s;tabli&s;hed, and who doubtle&s;s had too much rea&s;on to remain faithful to the Empre&s;s to think of con&s;piring again&s;t her. Far from profiting by this good council, the Prince&s;s was &s;o imprudent|ly frank as to &s;peak of it to Alexius Orloff, who with great ea&s;e delivered his ju&s;tification, and thenceforth threw a deeper &s;hade of di&s;&s;imulation and addre&s;s into his &s;peeches and behaviour. Not &s;atis|fied with fanning the ambition of the young Ru&s;&s;ian, he put on the &s;emblance of a pa&s;&s;ion for her, and &s;ucceeded &s;o far as to in&s;pire her with a true one. So &s;oon as he was a&s;&s;ured of it, he conjured her to enter into a union with him by the mo&s;t &s;acred ties. She unhappily con&s;ented; and it was even with joy that the poor unfortunate Lady promi&s;ed to &s;olem|nize a marriage which mu&s;t con&s;ummate her ruin. She thought that the title of &s;pou&s;e of Count Alex|ius Orloff would &s;helter her invincibly from tho&s;e treacheries which &s;he was taught to apprehend. She entertained not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion that a man could make religion and the mo&s;t &s;acred titles &s;ub&s;er|vient to the de&s;truction of an innocent victim. But,
<PB N="19" REF="035113_0033_1000BE5A83417348">
alas! was any religion, was any title &s;acred to the barbarian into who&s;e &s;nares &s;he had fallen?&mdash;He who could &s;trangle the unfortunate Peter III. could he dread to di&s;honour the daughter of Elizabeth?</P>
<P>Feigning a de&s;ire that the marriage ceremony &s;hould be performed according to the ritual of the Greek Church, he &s;uborned &s;ubaltern villains to di&s;|gui&s;e them&s;elves as prie&s;ts and lawyers. Thus profanation was combined with impo&s;ture again&s;t the innocent and unprotected Tarrakanoff!</P>
<P>When Alexius Orloff was become the hu&s;band, or rather the ravi&s;her of this unhappy Prince&s;s, he re|pre&s;ented to her, that their &s;tay at Rome expo&s;ed her to too clo&s;e ob&s;ervation, and that it would be advi&s;eable for her to go to &s;ome other city of Italy, to wait for the breaking out of the con&s;piracy that was to call her to the throne. Believing this ad|vice to be dictated by love and prudence, &s;he an|&s;wered that &s;he would follow him wherever he cho&s;e to conduct her. He brought her immediately to Pi|&s;a, where he had previou&s;ly hired a magnificent pa|lace. There he continued to treat her with marks of tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect; but he permitted none to come near her, except per&s;ons who were entirely at his devotion; and when &s;he went to the play or to the public promenade, he accompanied her al|ways him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion of the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;quadron under the command of Admiral Greig, had ju&s;t entered the port of Leghorn. On relating this news to the Prince&s;s, Orloff told her, that his pre&s;ence was ne|ce&s;sary at Leghorn for the purpo&s;e of giving &s;ome orders, and offered to take her with him. To this &s;he readily con&s;ented, as &s;he had heard much talk of the beauty of the port of Leghorn and the magnifi|cence of the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;hips.&mdash;Imprudent Lady! the nearer &s;he approached the cata&s;trophe of the plot, the more &s;he tru&s;ted to the tenderne&s;s and the &s;incer|ity of her faithle&s;s betrayer!</P>
<P>She departed from Pi&s;a with her cu&s;tomay attend|ants. On arriving at Leghorn, &s;he landed at the

Several la|dies were early in making their vi&s;its, and &s;edulou&s;ly attended her on all occa&s;ions. She &s;aw her&s;elf pre|&s;ently &s;urrounded by a numerous court, eager to be beforehand with all her de&s;ires, and &s;eeming to make it their only &s;tudy ince&s;&s;antly to procure her &s;ome new entertainment. Whenever &s;he went out, the people ran in her way. At the theatre all eyes were directed to her box. All circum&s;tances con&s;pir|ed to lull her into a fatal &s;ecurity.

It is nece&s;&s;ary then to &s;hew what were the duties and di&s;tinctions of the <HI>Favourites</HI> of Catherine.&mdash;When her Maje&s;ty had fixed her choice on a new Favourite, &s;he created him her General Aid-de-camp, in order that he might accompany her every where without attracting reproach or inviting ob|&s;ervation. Thenceforward the Favourite occupied in the palace an apartment beneath that of the Em|pre&s;s, to which it communicated by a private &s;tair|ca&s;e. The fir&s;t day of his in&s;tallment he received a pre&s;ent of 100,000 rubles, and every month he found 12,000 on his dre&s;&s;ing-table. The Mar&s;hal of the Court was commi&s;&s;ioned to provide him a table of 24 covers, and to defray all the expences of his hou&s;e|hold.

<HEAD>HORACE WALPOLE, LORD ORFORD.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. Walpole was the younge&s;t &s;on of the famous Sir Rob. Walpole, many years prime Mini&s;ter to George I. and II.&mdash;Horace was born in the year 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">5, and received a com|plete education at Eton &s;chool, at Cambridge, and by his travels in Italy, &amp;c. He was many years a Member of Parliament, latterly he a&s;cended to the Peerage, was ac|quainted with the fir&s;t wits of the age, was di&s;encumber|ed of either wife or children, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an in|dependent fortune&mdash;in &s;hort, he had every opportunity that a man could have, to improve his mind and increa&s;e his knowledge. He died in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">0th year of his age, leaving a fortune of 95,000l. in the 3 per cent. Stock.&mdash;He bequeathed 10,000l. to the Duche&s;s of Glouce&s;ter, 5000l. to Lady Waldegrave, 5000l. to each of the Mi&s;s Berrys, and 500l. to each of his nephews.&mdash;When he was above 70 years of age, he offer'd to marry either of the Mi&s;s Berrys, but, &s;trange to tell, both of them had the courage to refu&s;e a Lord and 95,000l. yet he generou&s;ly remembered them in his will.&mdash;To Mrs. Damer (celebrated for her uncommon ta&s;te as a &s;tatuary) he left 2000l. and the beautiful &s;eat of Strawberry Hill, &s;ituated on the bank of the Thames, near to London.</P>
<P>After Mr. Walpole had retired from Parliament, he dedi|cated him&s;elf entirely to the fine arts and literary pur|&s;uits. He publi&s;hed a Catalogue of Royal and Noble Au|thors, which di&s;plays much indu&s;try and judicious criti|ci&s;m. His hi&s;toric doubts re&s;pecting the life and true cha|racter of Richard III. are replete with great ingenuity and &s;ound argument. The only dramatic work he ever produced was, The My&s;terious Mother, a tragedy, printed at his own pre&s;s (for he was both a Poet and a Printer, kindred Arts) at Strawberry Hill; the &s;tory is worthy of peru&s;al in the clo&s;et, but too horrid, perhaps too indelicate, for public repre&s;entation.

<P>Of the circum&s;tances that en&s;ued on Koni&s;mark's di&s;appearance I am ignorant; nor am I acquainted with the laws of Germany relative to divorce or &s;ep|aration: nor do I know or &s;uppo&s;e that De&s;poti&s;m and Pride allow the law to in&s;i&s;t on much formality when a Sovereign has rea&s;on or a mind to get rid of his wife. Perhaps too much difficulty of untying the Gordian knot of Matrimony thrown in the way of an ab&s;olute Prince would be no kindne&s;s to the la|dies, but might prompt him to u&s;e a &s;harper wea|pon, like that butchering hu&s;band our Henry VIII. Sovereigns, who narrow or let out the law of God according to their prejudices and pa&s;&s;ions, mould their own laws no doubt to the &s;tandard of their con|venience. Genealogic purity of blood is the predo|minant folly of Germany: and the code of Malta &s;eems to have more force in the empire than the ten Commandments.

<P>Thus, the dagger is the duel of the populace&mdash;and thus, revenge con&s;titutes the police of Rome!</P>
<P>In &s;hort, in Rome, there is neither military &s;pirit, nor municipal ju&s;tice&mdash;Be&s;ides, there are near &s;even hundred <HI>Places of Refuge</HI> in Rome, and every hou&s;e on which a Cardinal has placed his arms, is a place of refuge for creditors!&mdash;Some Cardinals make a gainful traffic of their a&s;ylums!</P>
<P>Mendicity, that degeneration of poverty, the pre|carious &s;tate of which in other countries is the ordi|nary &s;ource of robberies, has not that inconvenience at Rome; here it is a certain profe&s;&s;ion. A man, a woman, or a child, has only to hang out a few rags, or expo&s;e a &s;ore, and they procure victuals. The pity of the Romans never rea&s;ons&mdash;and what does a mendicant want?&mdash;Degraded by mi&s;ery, or di&s;ea&s;e, or idlene&s;s, animal life is enough for him; give him &s;omething to eat, and he is as happy&mdash;as his dog!</P>
<P>There are more beggars at Rome than any other City. They &s;warm on all &s;ides; and the pilgrim|ages add to their number. Every place is open to them; they are permitted to &s;eek every where for charity. Delicacy &s;uffers and murmurs at this; but Humanity bids us to con&s;ider that they are men.</P>
<P>At Rome, therefore, mi&s;ery, indolence, ambition, or the de&s;ire of women, do not excite to robbery&mdash;I &s;ay, the de&s;ire of the &s;ex; for the climate and the manners of the country, furni&s;h women even to &s;a|tiety&mdash;Private debauchery is &s;o great, that public debauchery is not perceived!</P>

In the hi&s;tory of civilized nations, the Chapter of Women is divided into three &s;ections; Beauty, Gal|lantry, and Dre&s;s. The Roman women, like the Italian women in general, are &s;till in a &s;tate of ig|norance in an art &s;o exten&s;ive and important as that of Dre&s;s; in the art of adapting ornament to dre&s;s, and both to the &s;hape, features, complexion, age, and the different hours of the morning or evening; in the art of &s;oftening by gradations, of adju&s;ting by &s;hades, of availing them&s;elves of contra&s;ts&mdash;in &s;hort, in that art, &s;o co&s;tly and &s;cientific, of completely e|quipping a woman for vanity, coquetry, or fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Shall I tell it?&mdash;Will it be believed!&mdash;All the wo|men in Rome wear WIGS!&mdash;It is a &s;acrifice made to indolence by their coquetry. Accu&s;tomed to lye down every day, after dinner, till &s;ix in the evening, to place a &s;econd night in the middle of the day, they have found it too trouble&s;ome to build up the edifice of a head-dre&s;s twice in the &s;ame day, and therefore indolently re&s;ign their locks to the &s;ci&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The Roman ladies are in the habit of putting on white paint when in full dre&s;s. The Italian lady wi&s;hes to be a lilly; the French lady, a ro&s;e What, has not beneficent Nature made them women?&mdash;Why will they thus disfigure them&s;elves?&mdash;They mu&s;t have gauzes, feathers, flowers, and artificial heads; has not Nature given them beautiful hair?&mdash;Rouge; has &s;he not adorned them with the blu&s;h of mode&s;ty?&mdash;White; altho' &s;he has given them the mo&s;t deli|cate complexion?</P>
<P>It is a fact, that the &s;uperfluity of exi&s;tence, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, never fails to produce that unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation, which the French call <HI>ennui,</HI> and the Engli&s;h, listli&s;sne&s;s, &s;ometimes, <HI>nothing to doi&s;h|ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;But this &s;uperfluity of time, after the grati|fication of their mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing appetites, the modern Romans expend in &s;leep, in love, in frivolities, or in religious proce&s;&s;ions.</P>

<P>Throughout all the intercour&s;e of the great with the great, and of the great with the little, in Rome, there reigns a certain ea&s;e, politene&s;s, and univer&s;al flattery. This proceeds from the opportunities For|tune here enjoys of exerci&s;ing all her caprices, and this, generally, in &s;ecret and in &s;ilence, by means of valets, monks, &s;ecretaries, and intriguing women.&mdash;Nobody, therefore, is acquainted with whom he has to do,&mdash;To-morrow, perhaps, that Prie&s;t may be a Pope, that Monk may be a Cardinal, or that valet a man in power.&mdash;In this &s;tate of doubt, every body is civil to every body; and, in this &s;tate of uncertain|ty, every body lavi&s;hes good wi&s;hes, &s;miles, and &s;queezes of the hand!</P>

<P>The Romi&s;h religion, by its ab&s;olutions, throws a convenient veil over the pa&s;t, and, by its promi&s;es, gives a favourable colouring to the future.

<P>The&s;e 2000 ball rooms of the capital afford ample proof that no revolution has taken place in the man|ners of the French, and that they are &s;till a dancing nation. They have indeed of late fully demon&s;tra|ted to the world that they are capable of greater things; and that when the energies of their &s;ouls are called forth, they can follow Buonaparte acro&s;s the bridge of Lodi; but when their minds return to its natural po&s;ition, every barrack has a room appro|riated for dancing, and the Heroes of Arcole, as well as the <HI>Mu&s;cadins</HI> of Paris,

<P>The fetes of the Court, it is a&s;&s;erted by the few per&s;ons remaining in France, by whom they were frequented, were but tawdry &s;plendour compared with the cla&s;&s;ical elegance which prevails at the fetes of our republican Contractors. As a &s;pecimen of the&s;e private balls, I &s;hall trace a &s;hort &s;ketch of
<PB N="48" REF="035113_0062_1000BE99E2853050">
a dance lately given by one of the furni&s;hers of &s;tores for fleets and armies, in his &s;pacious Hotel, where all the furniture, in compliance with the pre|&s;ent fa&s;hion at Paris, is antique; where all that is not Greek is Roman; where &s;tately &s;ilken beds, ma&s;&s;y &s;ophas, worked tape&s;try, and gilt ornaments, are thrown a&s;ide as rude gothic magnificence, and e|very couch re&s;embles that of Pericles, every chair tho&s;e of Cicero; where every wall is fini&s;hed in ara|be&s;que, like the baths of Titus, and every table, upheld by Ca&s;tors and Polluxes, is covered with A|thenian bu&s;ts and Etru&s;can va&s;es; where that modern piece of furniture a clock is concealed beneath the cla&s;&s;ic bar of Phoebus, and the dancing hours; and every chimney-iron is &s;upported by a Sphinx, or a Griffin.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of his female vi&s;itors was in perfect harmony with the furniture of his hotel; for al|though the Pari&s;ian ladies are not &s;u&s;pected of any ob&s;tinate attachment to Grecian modes of govern|ment, they are mo&s;t rigid partizans of Grecian modes of dre&s;s, adorned like the cotemporaries of A&s;pa&s;ia&mdash;the loo&s;e light drapery, the naked arm, the bare bo&s;om, the &s;andaled feet, the circling zone, the golden chains, the twi&s;ling tre&s;&s;es, all di&s;play the mo&s;t inflexible conformity to the laws of republi|can co&s;tume. The mo&s;t fa&s;hionable hair-dre&s;&s;er of Paris, in order to accommodate him&s;elf to the cla&s;&s;ical ta&s;te of his fair cu&s;tomers, is provided with a varie|ty of antique bu&s;ts as models; and when he waits on a lady, enquires if &s;he chu&s;es to be dre&s;t that day <HI>a la Cleopatre, la Dianne,</HI> or <HI>la P&s;yche?</HI>&mdash;Sometimes the changeful nymph is a ve&s;tal, &s;ometimes a Venus; but the la&s;t rage has been the <HI>Niobe;</HI> of late fat and lean, gay and grave, old and young, have been all <HI>a la Niobe;</HI> and the many-curled periwig, thrown a&s;ide by the fa&s;hionable cla&s;s, now decorates the heads of petty &s;hopkeepers.</P>
<P>The fair Grecians being determined not to injure the contour of fine forms by &s;uperfluous incumbran|ces, no fa&s;hionable lady at Paris wears any pockets,

and the inconvenience of being without is obviated by &s;ticking her fan in her belt, &s;liding in a flat pur&s;e of Morocco leather, only large enough to contain a few louis, at the &s;ide of her neck, and giving her &s;nuff-box and her pocket-handkerchief to the care of the gentleman who attends her, and to whom &s;he ap|plies for them whenever &s;he has occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>For a &s;hort time during the winter, in defiance of fro&s;t and &s;now, the co&s;tume of a few reigning belles was not <HI>a la grec,</HI> but <HI>a la &s;auvage.</HI> To be dre&s;&s;ed <HI>a la &s;auvage,</HI> was to have all that part of the frame which was not left uncovered clad in a light drapery of fle&s;h colour. The boddice under which no lin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n was worn (&s;hifts being an article of dre&s;s long &s;ince rejected at Paris, both by the Greeks and the Sava|ges) the boddice was made of knitted &s;ilk, clinging exactly to the &s;hape, which is perfectly di&s;played; the petticoat was on one &s;ide twi&s;ted up by a light fe&s;toon; and the feet, which were either bare or co|vered with a &s;ilk &s;tocking of fle&s;h colour, &s;o woven as to draw upon the toes like a glove upon the fingers, were decorated with diamonds. The&s;e gentle &s;ava|ges, however, found them&s;elves &s;o rudely treated whenever they appeared by the &s;overeign multitude, that at length the fa&s;hions of Otaheite were thrown a&s;ide, and Greece remains the &s;tanding order of the day.</P>
<P>But to return to the Contractor, and his ball&mdash;Af|ter &s;everal hours had pa&s;t in dancing cotillions, which the young women of Paris perform with a degree of perfection&mdash;a light nymphi&s;h grace un&s;een el&s;ewhere&mdash;and after the wal&s;e, which is now never forgotten at a Paris ball, had proved that the &s;teady heads of Niobes were not to be made giddy, the company were led to a &s;upper furni&s;hed with Ea&s;tern magnificence, and decorated with attic ta&s;te. After &s;upper the folding doors of the &s;aloon were thrown open to a garden of con&s;iderable extent, beautifully illuminated with coloured lamps, and its trees bend|ing with lavi&s;h clu&s;ters of fruits of every &s;ea&s;on, and every climate, formed of ice, while fountains pour|ed forth &s;treams of orgeat, lemonade, and liqueurs!</P>

But while the&s;e imitators of Greece and Rome are revelling in A&s;iatic luxury, you hear them lamenting mo&s;t pathetically the &s;ubver&s;ion of the ancient Re|gime; that Regime, which would at lea&s;t have had thus much of ju&s;tice, that it would have retained the&s;e per&s;onages in the anti-chambers of the &s;aloons they now occupy; to which anti-chambers they would with a counter-revolution mo&s;t probably re|turn.

<P>At pre&s;ent I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the reign of Terror has acted upon this country like &s;ome mighty pe&s;tilence, which not only &s;weeps away devoted mil|lions in its fury, but leaves an obnoxious taint upon every object where it has pa&s;&s;ed. The reign of ter|ror has given a fatal wound to the energies of public &s;pirit; ordinary minds have mi&s;taken the execrable abu&s;es of Liberty for an effect of the generous prin|ciple it&s;elf the victims of revolutionary government have lifted up their complaining voice; all emotions of &s;ympathy, and all the feelings of indignation have been called forth; and the partizans of the an|cient Regime have left no art unpracti&s;ed, no &s;educ|tion untried, to take advantage of the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions in favour of their own &s;y&s;tem.</P>

Tho&s;e who have been too rapidly enriched by the Revolution, have endeavoured to hide the ob&s;curity of their origin, by mimicking the tones of tho&s;e who have titles and honours to regret, till Ari&s;tocracy has de&s;cended &s;o low, that it will &s;oon perhaps be exploded, like any other fa&s;hion, when taken up by the vulgar. The&s;e very ladies, who have taught their new-made Liege Lords to ape their counter-revolutionary follies, will at length be a&s;hamed of their Ari&s;tocracy, when they find how &s;ucce&s;sfully they are rivalled in tho&s;e &s;entiments by their mil|liners and mantua-makers. A writer of a late poli|tical pamphlet has given an admirable rea&s;on why our Pari&s;ian belles will &s;oon lay a&s;ide the tone of e|ternal lamentations for the overthrow of de&s;poti&s;m. "Seven years," &s;ays he, "have already elap&s;ed &s;ince the epocha of the Revolution: &s;even years is a period of &s;ome length in the hi&s;tory of a youthful beauty, and a lady will not regret the Monarchy under the penalty of pa&s;&s;ing for old." I believe every per&s;on who has &s;tudied the female heart, will agree with this writer, that the Republic has a tol|erable chance upon this principle of obtaining ere long many fair pro&s;elytes.</P>
<P>Public balls, as well as concerts, were held la&s;t winter at the <HI>Theatre Francais,</HI> which, after having been long &s;hut up, was repaired, embelli&s;hed, and baptized by the Greek name of the <HI>Odeon;</HI> and that no jealou&s;y might exi&s;t between the balls and con|certs, on account of this cla&s;&s;ical nomenclature, the balls immediately received the appellation of <HI>Thia&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>But the mo&s;t &s;ingular &s;pecies of amu&s;ement which the la&s;t winter produced, were &s;ub&s;cription-balls, entitled as <HI>des bals a la Victime.</HI> Such, and &s;o power|ful was the rage for plea&s;ure, that a certain number of its votaries who during the tyranny of Robe&s;|pierre, had lo&s;t their neare&s;t relations on the &s;caffold, in&s;tituted, not days of &s;uch &s;olemn, &s;ad commemo|ration, as is dear to the &s;uper&s;tition of tenderne&s;s, when, in melancholy proce&s;&s;ion, clad in &s;able, and

wreathed in cypre&s;s, they might have knelt, a mourning multitude, around the &s;pot where the mu|tilated bodies of their murdered parents had been thrown by the executioner; and bathed the &s;od with tho&s;e bitter tears which filial affection, or organized love, &s;hed over the broken ties of nature, or of pa&s;|&s;ion&mdash;no!&mdash;the commemorative rites which the&s;e mourners offered to the manes of their ma&s;&s;acred re|lations, were fe&s;tive balls!

Had Holbein been pre&s;ent at &s;uch a &s;pectacle, no doubt he would have enriched his death-dance with new images, and led forward each gay nymph by an attendant headle&s;s &s;pectre. The indignant cry of public opinion, how|ever, was at length heard above the mu&s;ic of the wal&s;e and the cotillion; and the <HI>bal a la victime</HI> exi&s;ts no longer to bear its powerful te&s;timony to a depra|vation, not merely of manners, but of the heart.</P>

<HEAD>MODERN LONDON, At the Clo&s;e of the 18th Century.</HEAD>
<P>LONDON, the metropolis of Great Britain, one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t opulent cities in the world, is mentioned by Tacitus as a place of con|&s;iderable note in the time of Nero. London is near|ly 8 miles long on the banks of the Thames, above 3 miles wide, and 24 miles in circumference, con|taining 8000 &s;treets, lanes, and alleys, and 65 &s;quares in which are above 162,000 hou&s;es, be&s;ides ware|hou&s;es and public buildings; the inhabitants are rec|koned 1,250,000, being fully 400,000 more than what are e&s;timated in the city of Paris. Taking a compa&s;s of ten miles round St. Paul's church, which would include nearly 100 towns and villages, the number of inhabitants would then be 1,500,000, a fourth part of the whole of the people in the United States e&s;timated at their greate&s;t number, and more than all the inhabitants of Virginia, both black and white!</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="035113_0070_1000AC8597C92838">
London, with all its opulence, is not remarkable for its elegance. The &s;treets are crooked, narrow, and irregular; nor are its public buildings appropri|ately magnificent. St. Paul's Church is the mo&s;t re|markable modern fabric; indeed it is a noble pile, and only inferior to St. Peter's in Rome. It is 2292 feet in circumference, and 365 feet in height (&s;ee Note p. 44)&mdash;As a Gothic building, We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey is a grand &s;pecimen of that kind of architec|ture; it was founded by the Ea&s;t Saxons in the year 610; it is 365 feet in length, and 195 broad. It contains a greater number and variety of monuments than any church in the world; and Henry the VIII's Chapel has been called one of the Wonders of the World. The bridges over the Thames are a great ornament to London. The mo&s;t ancient is London bridge, fini&s;hed about the year 1200; it has 19 ar|ches, and is 950 feet long. We&s;tmin&s;ter bridge is one of the fine&s;t in the world; it was built by La|belle, a native of Switzerland, and was fini&s;hed in the year 1750; it has 15 arches, and is 1225 long. Blackfriar's bridge, built by Mylne, a Scotchman, was completed in the year 1768; it is 995 feet long, and con&s;i&s;ts of 9 elliptical arches, the centre one 100 feet wide, and all of them wider than the famous Rialto at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>But as we have not room to particulari&s;e all the public buildings, we mu&s;t mention in the gro&s;s.&mdash;London contains 240 churches and chapels of the e|&s;tabli&s;hed Religion; 207 Meeting-hou&s;es for Di&s;&s;ent|ters of different denominations; 45 Chapels for Fo|reigners; and 6 Synagogues for Jews. It has 4050 &s;eminaries of Education, 170 Alms-hou&s;es, and 750 In&s;titutions for charitable u&s;es, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The broad &s;tream of the river Thames flowing be|tween London and Southwark, continually agitated by a bri&s;k current, or a rapid tide, brings con&s;tant &s;upplies of fre&s;h and whole&s;ome air into this va&s;t city, which is remarkably healthy, con&s;idering its &s;ize. The cleanline&s;s of London is greatly aided by its &s;ituation on the Thames; and the New River fur|ther
<PB N="57" REF="035113_0071_1000BEA81957EE28">
contributes to the abundance of that very ne|ce&s;&s;ary element. The &s;ituation al&s;o is fortunate with regard to navigation; had it been placed lower on the Thames, it would have been annoyed by un|whole&s;ome mar&s;hes, and more liable to the attacks of foreign enemies; had it been higher, it would not have been acce&s;&s;ible to ve&s;&s;els of burthen. It now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every advantage that can be derived from a &s;ea-port, without its dangers; and, at the &s;ame time, by means of its noble river, enjoys an exten|&s;ive communication with the internal parts of the country. London, therefore, unites in it&s;elf all the benefits ari&s;ing from navigation and commerce, with tho&s;e of a metropolis at which all the public bu&s;ine&s;s of a great commercial nation is tran&s;acted. In the port of London alone, 13,500 ve&s;&s;els, and 50,000 waggons (including their repeated voyages and jour|nies) annually bring and carry away property to the amount of 120 millions!&mdash;Add to this &s;um, the mer|chandize, provi&s;ions, bank-notes, ca&s;h, jewels, &amp;c. depo&s;ited, and in con&s;tant circulation within the me|tropolis, in the cour&s;e of the year, the whole may fairly be e&s;timated at 170 millions &s;terling!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><TABLE>

<HEAD>HUME'S HISTORY. For the VIRGINIAN REPOSITORY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Editor of the Collection, entitled WASH|INGTONIANA, has taken upon him to recom|mend Hume's Hi&s;tory of England for "the purity of its &s;tyle." I know it is a common opinion, that Mr. Hume is a very elegant hi&s;torian; a powerful &s;et of men, who find it their intere&s;t to &s;upport a conjunc|tion of Church and State, have &s;aid &s;o&mdash;but a popu|lar opinion is not always a ju&s;t one; the voice of the People is not always the voice of God, in liter|ary di&s;qui&s;itions; and, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, I am in|clined to think, that the public has been led to be|lieve what will not bear the te&s;t of a critical exami|nation&mdash;I am one of tho&s;e who think, that the &s;tyle of Hume's Hi&s;tory does not de&s;erve &s;uch high re|commendations as it has received; on the contrary, it appears to me to be often clum&s;y, frequently in|correct, and never elevated beyond mediocrity.</P>
<P>As the &s;ubject is worthy of con&s;ideration, I am in hopes you will give the following ob&s;ervations a place in your Repo&s;itory.&mdash;I freely confe&s;s, however, that they are not altogether original; but they will not, I pre&s;ume, be con&s;idered the le&s;s curious and impor|tant, becau&s;e they happen to accord with the judge|ment of an able Critic in London. And I think it
<PB N="63" REF="035113_0077_1000BEB4AD9D0468">
a duty. I owe to my fellow citizens of the United States, not only to guard them again&s;t Toryi&s;m and Infidelity,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Hume's fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay as a Hi&s;torian was two volumes in defence of the Hou&s;e of Stewart. The&s;e met with &s;o favourable a reception from a numerous Party, that he leng|thened his book into a Hi&s;tory of England, including the affairs of Scotland. From whence it will be &s;een, that Mr. Hume's out&s;et was a profe&s;&s;ed defence of Tory principles, and how unfit he is to be con&s;idered as an impartial hi&s;tori|cal guide with re&s;pect to political doctrines&mdash;indeed he is the favourite Author of all the advocates for Monarchy, and is con&s;idered by them as a &s;tandard authority.</P>
<P>Gold&s;mith was al&s;o on the Tory &s;ide, and yet his Abridge|ment is become a School-book!</P></NOTE> but al&s;o from being led believe, that there are purity and elegance of &s;tyle where they are not.</P>
<P>As Mr. Hume's character of Queen Elizabeth has been particularly admired, I &s;hall &s;elect that portion of his Hi&s;tory, and try it by the touch&s;tone of gram|matical correctne&s;s and cla&s;&s;ical purity.</P>
<P>"There are few per&s;onages in Hi&s;tory, who have been more <HI>expo&s;ed</HI> to the calumny of enemies, and the adulation of friends, than Queen Elizabeth; and yet there &s;carcely is any who&s;e reputation has been more certainly determined by the unanimous con&s;ent of po&s;terity."&mdash;</P>
<P>Now, the writer did not mean what is here a&s;|&s;erted. Elizabeth's character is no more <HI>expo&s;ed</HI> to calumny and adulation, than the character of any other per&s;onage, becau&s;e Calumny and Adulation make no rational di&s;tinctions. Her character may, indeed, have <HI>incurred</HI> more calumny and adulation, or have been the <HI>object</HI> of them, than that of mo&s;t other people; and this is what the Writer would have expre&s;&s;ed, had he known how to write Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>"The unu&s;ual length of her <HI>admini&s;tration,</HI> and the &s;trong <HI>features</HI> of her character, were able to over|come all difficulties; and obliging her detractors to abate much of their invectives, and her admirers &s;omewhat of their panegyrics, have, at la&s;t, in &s;pite of political factions, and, what is more, of religious

animo&s;ities, produced a uniform judgement with re|gard to her conduct."&mdash;</P>
<P>No judge of the Engli&s;h language will venture to &s;ay, that there is either purity or elegance in this pa&s;&s;age. A correct writer would have put <HI>reign</HI> in|&s;tead of <HI>admini&s;tration.</HI> The fancy too of a <HI>feature</HI> as able to overcome a prejudice, will have but few ad|mirers among&s;t readers of ta&s;te and di&s;cernment.&mdash;In&s;tead of <HI>a</HI> uniform, it &s;hould be written <HI>an</HI> uniform judgement, &amp;c. And how in&s;ipid is the conclu&s;ion?&mdash;"a uniform judgement with regard to her con|duct!"&mdash;The poore&s;t &s;cribbler for a News-paper could not have clothed his &s;entiment in more beggarly language.</P>
<P>"Her vigour, her <HI>con&s;tancy,</HI> her magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, addre&s;s, are allowed to merit the highe&s;t prai&s;es, and appear not to have been &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed by any per&s;on that ever filled a throne."&mdash;</P>
<P>Where is the elegance of this pa&s;&s;age?&mdash;Be&s;ides, <HI>con&s;tancy,</HI> in its general &s;en&s;e, is well repre&s;ented by the <HI>con&s;tantia</HI> of the Romans, but Engli&s;h readers ap|ply the word to love or friend&s;hip. <HI>Per&s;everance,</HI> or <HI>firmne&s;s,</HI> or &s;ome equivalent expre&s;&s;ion, would much better have repre&s;ented the writer's intention in this place. And the la&s;t clau&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age is particu|larly cold and undignified.</P>
<P>"A conduct le&s;s rigorous, le&s;s imperious, more &s;in|cere, more indulgent to her people, <HI>would have been</HI> requi&s;ite to form a perfect character."&mdash;</P>
<P>How, <HI>would have been?</HI>&mdash;It &s;hould be "<HI>is</HI> requi&s;ite" in addition to her excellencies.</P>
<P>"By the force of her mind, &s;he controlled all her more active and &s;tronger <HI>qualities,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to the idea of &s;ome Writers, the word <HI>qua|lity</HI> does not properly apply to Vice, but only to Virtue.&mdash;Thus we &s;ay, the quality of <HI>courage,</HI> of <HI>temperance,</HI> or of <HI>chas|tity;</HI> but we cannot, according to this opinion, with pro|priety, &s;ay the quality of <HI>cowardice,</HI> of <HI>drunkenness,</HI> or of <HI>las|civiousness</HI>&mdash;The&s;e, &s;ay they, are <HI>propensities,</HI> not <HI>qualities</HI>&mdash;A que&s;tion for the Critics.</NOTE> and prevented them from running into exce&s;s."&mdash;</P>

This pa&s;&s;age is a flat contradiction to the former. If &s;he were free from <HI>exce&s;s</HI> in her &s;tronger qualities, why &s;hould we wi&s;h her to have been <HI>le&s;s</HI> imperious, or <HI>le&s;s</HI> rigorous than &s;he was?&mdash;The Writer appears to be actuated by a &s;trong de&s;ire to exhibit a &s;triking antithe&s;is, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a clearne&s;s of conception or a dexterity of language, &s;ufficient for his purpo&s;e. It is this &s;uperficial glitter that impo&s;es upon the ne|gligent or un&s;kilful reader, but will not impo&s;e upon the calm and judicious Critic.&mdash;The whole of this &s;entence is in&s;ipid, and does not &s;hew a &s;ingle &s;troke of a ma&s;ter arti&s;t.</P>
<P>"Her heroi&s;m was exempt from temerity, her frugality from avarice, her friend&s;hip from partiality, her active temper from turbulence and a vain ambi|tion."&mdash;</P>
<P>The wording of this pa&s;&s;age may be well enough put together, but the po&s;itions are very di&s;putable, and will be acceded to by very few who have care|fully and impartially &s;tudied this Queen's charac|ter.</P>
<P>"She guarded not her&s;elf with equal care, or e|qual &s;ucce&s;s, from le&s;&s;er infirmities; the rival&s;hip of beauty, the de&s;ire of admiration, and the &s;allies of anger."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"Rival&s;hip of Beauty"&mdash;Queen Elizabeth had no beau|ty to boa&s;t of; on the contrary, by the be&s;t accounts we have of her per&s;on, &s;he was a very ordinary, forbidding figure, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, and immoderately fond of admiration; even the gro&s;&s;e&s;t flattery was acceptable to her.&mdash;Hence aro&s;e her implacable hatred to Queen Mary, who was the mo&s;t beautiful woman of the age.&mdash;Her long pre|meditated murder of the unfortunate Mary, under the moc|kery of legal forms, &s;tands upon authentic records, as the mo&s;t atrocious and treacherous act that has been perpetrated in any country.&mdash;Taking in all the circum&s;tances, it is one of the mo&s;t affecting &s;tories related in Hi&s;tory.&mdash;[For the be&s;t accounts of Mary's life and misfortunes, con&s;ult Robert&s;on on one &s;ide, and Stewart on the other.]</P>
<P>From the a&s;&s;umed <HI>chastity</HI> of Elizabeth&mdash;&s;he was called the <HI>Virgin Queen</HI>&mdash;aro&s;e the name of this State, <HI>Virginia.</HI> Per|haps the pre&s;ent generation of <HI>Virginians</HI> will applaud the fitne&s;s of this appellation&mdash;certainly they will wonder at the curious, and oft-times ridiculous circum&s;tances, which give ri&s;e to the mo&s;t important affairs of the world.</P></NOTE>&mdash;</P>
<P>"The de&s;ire of admiration" wants vigour, and the "&s;allies of anger" make a mo&s;t unmu&s;ical conclu&s;ion. A well-tun'd ear will perceive the &s;uperiority of a different arrangement; "the &s;allies of anger, and the jealou&s;ies of love."</P>

<P>The &s;pecific term <HI>&s;ucceeded</HI> has no propriety in this place; he &s;hould have &s;aid, <HI>a&s;cended the throne.</HI> And what a tame redundancy in the two la&s;t words of the &s;entence&mdash;they &s;hould be expunged.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS of the Author of "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman." By W M. GODWIN.</HEAD>
<P>VULGAR tears fall and evaporate without lea|ving any trace behind them: but the tears of af|fection is often chry&s;tiali&s;ed by the power of genius, and converted into a permanent literary brilliant. Mr. Godwin, who&s;e abilities are indi&s;putable, endea|vours thus to dignify and render illu&s;trious his &s;or|rows for the lo&s;s of his wife; we therefore regret the nece&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving that not only the general reader, but the mo&s;t judicious and reflecting part of mankind, will arraign the prudence and the utility of the&s;e memoirs, though he him&s;elf commences them with this &s;entence of high expectation:&mdash;'there are not many individuals with who&s;e charcter the <HI>public welfare</HI> and <HI>improvement</HI> are more ultimately connected, than the author of "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman."</P>
<P>After an exordium &s;o &s;plendid, we could not ex|pect to find &s;uch a narrative;&mdash;a narrative which we mu&s;t indeed read with pity and concern, but which we &s;hould have advi&s;ed the author to bury in oblivion. Blu&s;hes would &s;uffu&s;e the checks of mo&s;t hu&s;bands if they were <HI>forced</HI> to relate tho&s;e anecdotes of their wives which Mr. Godwin voluntarily pro|claims to the world. The extreme exentricity of Mr. G.'s &s;entiments will account for this conduct. Virtue and Vice are weighed by him in a balance of his own. He neither looks to marriage with re&s;|pect, nor to &s;uicide with horror. He relates with complacency of Mary Woll&s;tonecaft, afterwards his wife, that &s;he cultivated a <HI>platonic</HI> affection for Mr. Fu&s;eli the painter:&mdash;that &s;he cohabited with Mr. Imaly as his wife, took his name and had a child by him, without being married; and that &s;he even li|ved with Mr. G. him&s;elf, and was pregnant by him; and that it was only her pregnancy which induced them to think of marriage; fearing that, otherwi&s;e &s;he might be excluded from &s;ociety. He gravely records, al&s;o, (what was mentioned at the time in
<PB N="69" REF="035113_0083_1000ADF1FB96C6A8">
the New&s;papers, and was con&s;idered by &s;ome per&s;ons as calumny,) her attempt to drown her&s;elf in the Thames, in con&s;equence of the ill-treatment which &s;he experienced from Mr. Imlay.</P>
<P>How the public welfare and improvement are connected with or can be advanced by the &s;tudied and uniform eulogium of &s;uch conduct will not be ea&s;ily perceived; nor will any reader of di&s;cernment who appreciates the merits of this unfortunate fe|male, even on the evidence of her own hu&s;band, be able to &s;ay with him that 'there are no circum&s;tances in her life that, in the judgment of honour and rea|&s;on, could brand her with di&s;grace!'&mdash;Peace to her manes! She was the child of Genius, but &s;he was al&s;o the child of Error!</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the incidents which compo&s;ed her &s;hort life are neither very &s;ingular nor very &s;triking. Where &s;he was born her hu&s;band does not know. She commenced the career of fame, like Milton, Sir Richard Blackmore, Dr. John&s;on, and others, by keeping a &s;chool;&mdash;&s;he then became a writer for a book&s;eller, and an occa&s;ional critic. She attracted notice by entering the li&s;ts again&s;t Mr. Burke, and particularly by her "Vindication of the Rights of Woman;" by the publication of which, in the o|pinion of her biographer, '&s;he will perhaps be found to have performed more &s;ub&s;tantial &s;ervice for the cau&s;e of her &s;ex, than all the other writers, male or female, that ever felt them&s;elves animated in the behalf of oppre&s;&s;ed and injured beauty.' Though this mu&s;t be deemed exaggerated prai&s;e, it may be forgiven from a hu&s;band, who, no doubt, mo&s;t &s;in|cerely mourns her lo&s;s; and our other female au|thors mu&s;t not take it ami&s;s that he &s;hould wi&s;h to have it believed, that 'no female writer ever ob|tained &s;o great a degree of celebrity throughout Eu|rope.'</P>

very prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing impre&s;&s;ions. At la&s;t, however, a &s;trong and mutual affection took place, and ripened into love.</P>
<P>'There was (Mr. G. &s;ays) no period of throes and re&s;olute explanation attendant on the tale. It was friend&s;hip melting into love. Previou&s;ly to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> declaration, each felt a&s;&s;ured, yet each felt a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> trembling anxiety to have a&s;&s;urance com|pleat!'&mdash;</P>
<P>To this account of the &s;incerity and ardour of their mutual pa&s;&s;ion, it is conci&s;ely added, '<HI>We did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,'</HI>&mdash;and then follows this poor, turgid at|tempt at a ju&s;tification:&mdash;</P>
<P>'It is difficult to recommend any thing to indi&s;cri|minate adoption, contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules and prejudices of mankind; but certainly nothing can be &s;o ridiculous upon the face of it, or &s;o contra|ry to the <HI>general march of &s;entiment,</HI> as to require the overflowing of the &s;oul to wait upon a ceremo|ny, and that which, whereever delicacy and imagi|nation exi&s;t, is of all things mo&s;t &s;acredly private, to blow a trumpet before it, and to record the moment when it has arrived at its climax.'</P>
<P>Apprehending that this very refined and &s;entimen|tal logic would not be &s;ufficient to convince the pub|lic of the propriety of their conduct in this re&s;pect, Mr. G. adds&mdash;'There were other rea&s;ons why we did not immediately marry&mdash;Mary felt an entire conviction of the propriety of her conduct.'&mdash;We que&s;tion this. Her experience, with Mr. Imlay, of the mi&s;erable con&s;equences to which a woman expo|&s;es her&s;elf by an unmarried connection, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have taught her the <HI>imprudence</HI> at lea&s;t of di&s;regarding the law of &s;ociety re&s;pecting marriage. No evil may re&s;ult from recording the Vow of Love; but many evils <HI>mu&s;t</HI> re&s;ult from a neglect, or a contempt of the Law of Marriage. It is one of the mo&s;t important in&s;titutions of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>On this &s;ubject, Mr. Godwin rather gives his own opinions than tho&s;e of his wife; or, he exhibits her's with the colouring of his theoretical &s;y&s;tem thrown

over them,&mdash;But let us li&s;ten to his account of her religion?&mdash;</P>
<P>'Her religion was little allied to any &s;y&s;tem of forms; it was founded rather in <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> than in the niceties of polemical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Her mind con&s;titu|tionally attached it&s;elf to the <HI>&s;ublime</HI> and the <HI>amiable.</HI> She found an inexpre&s;&s;ible delight in the beauties of Nature, and in <HI>the &s;plendid reveries of the imagination!</HI>&mdash;When &s;he walked amid&s;t the wonders of Nature, &s;he was accu&s;tomed to conver&s;e with God. To her mind, He was pictured as not le&s;s amiable, kind and generous, than great, wi&s;e, and exalted. In fact, &s;he had received few le&s;&s;ons of religion in her youth, and her religion was almo&s;t entirely of her own cre|ation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here we perceive the &s;ource of all Mi&s;s Wol&s;tancroft's misfortunes, "the want of an early religions education."&mdash;She entered into the world without a &s;y&s;tem of either morals or religion, &s;he fell a victim to a "<HI>glowing imagination,</HI>" and became an object of &s;hame, and reproach, and mi&s;ery!&mdash;Such are the effects of a <HI>glowing imagination,</HI> particularly in a fe|male, without the re&s;training helps of Morals and Religion.&mdash;We under&s;tand by her life, which has been lately publi&s;h|ed, that her father was of an un&s;ettled di&s;po&s;ition, continu|ally moving from place to place, until at la&s;t he wa&s;ted all his property, and died in poverty.</NOTE> She could not recollect the time when &s;he had believed the doctrine of future puni&s;hments.&mdash;The tenets of her &s;y&s;tem were the growth of her own moral ta&s;te, and her religion was a gratification not a terror to her. She &s;ometimes li&s;tened to the &s;ermons of Dr. Price, but more frequently attended public wor&s;hip according to the forms of the Church of England. Latterly her attendance on Divine Ser|vice became le&s;s con&s;tant, and at length was wholly di&s;continued.&mdash;I believe (continues Mr. G.) that no per&s;on of <HI>a well furni&s;hed mind,</HI> that has &s;haken off the implicit &s;ubjection of youth, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> not the zeal|ous partizan of a Sect, can bring him&s;elf to conform to the regular routine of &s;ermons and prayers!'</P>
<P>The matrimonial happine&s;s of Mr. and Mrs. God|win was but of &s;hort contiuance. Their marriage was declared in April 1797, and &s;he died the Sep|tember following, in child-bed, aged 38.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="035113_0086_1000BEBC2B6F3788">
In the po&s;thumous works of Mrs. Godwin, we per|ceive a &s;eries of letters to Mr. I. who lived with her at Paris for a &s;hort time in <HI>matrimonial intimacy,</HI> but without the forms of marriage; he for&s;ook her when &s;he was pregnant, a prey to de&s;pair, and took up with another woman.&mdash;Almo&s;t any other hu&s;band than Mr. Godwin would have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the&s;e let|ters; yet he not only publi&s;hes them, but introduce them with a preface, in which he declares them to 'contain the fine&s;t examples of the language of <HI>&s;en|timent</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ion</HI> ever pre&s;ented to the world!'&mdash;We think &s;uch language little &s;hort of in&s;anity; e&s;|pecially when it appears, that her <HI>&s;entiments</HI> not be|ing guided by <HI>prudence,</HI> &s;he was left to &s;hame, mi&s;ery and de&s;pair!</P>
<P>The following extract from one of her letters to her unfaithful lover, will give our readers an idea of her <HI>glowing imagination:</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>"I obey an emotion of the heart, which made me think of wi&s;hing thee, my love, a good night, before I go to re&s;t, with more tenderne&s;s than I can to|morrow, when writing a ha&s;ty line under Colonel&mdash;'s eye. You can &s;carcely imagine with what plea&s;ure I anticipate the day, when we are to begin <HI>to live together;</HI> and you will &s;mile to hear how many plans of employment I have in my head, now that I am confident my heart has found peace in your bo|&s;om&mdash;[<HI>deluded, mi&s;taken woman!</HI>]&mdash;Cheri&s;h me with that <HI>dignified tenderne&s;s,</HI> which I have only found in you; and your own dear girl will try to keep under a <HI>quickne&s;s of feeling,</HI> that has &s;ometimes given you pain!&mdash;Yes, I will be good, that I may de&s;erve to be happy; and, whil&s;t you love me, I cannot again fall into the mi&s;erable &s;tate which rendered life a burthen almo&s;t too heavy to be borne.</P>
<P>"But, good night&mdash;God ble&s;s you!&mdash;Sterne &s;ays, that is equal to a ki&s;s; yet I would rather give you the ki&s;s into the bargain!</P>

<P><PB N="73" REF="035113_0087_1000AC9D544E1308">
The con&s;equence of this barrier a&s;&s;ignation was a child. It was called the <HI>Barrier Girl,</HI> from a belief that &s;he owed her exi&s;tence to this <HI>willing</HI> interview on the Lady's &s;ide&mdash;The man who could re&s;i&s;t &s;uch an invitation, mu&s;t be more than a Jo&s;eph!</P>
<P>Altho' Mi&s;s W. went, of her own accord, without form or &s;olicitation, on this occa&s;ion, to make a child, yet &s;he frequently lamented the evils to which Na|ture had &s;ubjected her &s;ex in the article of children; a &s;ubject which &s;he never could di&s;cu&s;s with patience, it being an evil to which man was not &s;ubjected.</P>
<P>"What &s;ignifies (cried &s;he) all the freedom of our &s;ouls, all the exaltation of our intellects, if we are to be confined for months to carry a burthen which we have no means to lay down; and when the little wretch appears to the world, what a dreadful idea!&mdash;With intellects that &s;oar beyond the firmament, are we to be confined to &s;waddle and dandle an ani|mal that has no ideas, and would at every moment de&s;troy it&s;elf, if we did not pre&s;erve it?&mdash;O horrid! that Nature did not provide &s;ome middle, &s;ome &s;tu|pid, lumpi&s;h being, to rear and take care of the hu|man progeny&mdash;Why not make man an oviparous ani|mal?&mdash;Then we might have hatched the eggs in &s;toves, as they do chickens in Egypt!"</P>

<P>This extraordinary man, BUONAPARTE, was born in the town of Ajaccio, in Cor&s;ica, in 1767, is the &s;on of Char. Buonaparte and Laetitia Raniolmi. His father, who was al&s;o a native Ajaccio, was bred to the law, at Rome, and took part with the celebra|ted Paoli, in the memorable &s;truggle made by a handful of brave i&s;landers, again&s;t the tyrannical ef|forts of Louis XV, and the Machiavelian &s;chemes of his mini&s;ter, Choi&s;eul.</P>
<P>I am a&s;&s;ured, by a near relation of the family, that he not only laid a&s;ide the gown upon this occa&s;i|on, but actually carried a mu&s;ket as a private con|tinel.</P>
<P>On the conque&s;t of the i&s;land, he wi&s;hed to retire, with the gallant chieftain who had &s;o nobly &s;trug|gled for its independence; but he was prevented by his uncle, a Canon, who exerci&s;ed a parental au|thority over him.</P>
<P>In 1773, a deputation from the three e&s;tates was &s;ent to wait on the king of France; and, on this occa&s;ion, Charles Buonaparte was &s;elected to repre|&s;ent the Nobles. He was &s;oon after promoted to the office of Procurotore Reale of Ajaccio, where his

ance&s;tors, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been originally from Tu&s;|cany, had been &s;ettled nearly two hundred years.</P>
<P>The family of the elder Buonaparte was numer|ous, for he had &s;even children: four &s;ons, and three daughters. It was his good fortune, however, to be cheri&s;hed by the French; and both he and his fa|mily lived in the greate&s;t intimacy with M. de Mar|boeuf, the Governor, who received a revenue of 60,000 livres a year, on condition of doing nothing! An Intendant was paid nearly as much, and a &s;warm of hungry leeches, engendered in the corruption of the court of Ver&s;ailles, at one and the &s;ame time &s;ucked the blood of the Corficans, and drained the trea&s;ure of the mother country; in &s;hort, like the conque&s;ts of more recent times, the &s;ubjugation of that i&s;land &s;eems to have been achieved for no other purpo&s;e, than to gratify avarice, and &s;atiate rapa|city.</P>
<P>On the death of his friend, Charles Buonaparte, M. de Marhoeuf continued to patronize his family, and placed his &s;econd &s;on, Napoleone, the &s;ubject of the&s;e memoirs, at the <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">le Militaire,</HI> or Military A|cademy. The advantage re&s;ulting from this &s;emina|ry, which has produced more great men than any o|ther in Europe, were not lo&s;t in young Buonaparte; he there applied him&s;elf with equal a&s;&s;iduity and ad|dre&s;s to mathematics, and &s;tudied the art of war as a regular &s;cience. Born in the mid&s;t of a repub|lican &s;truggle, in his native land, it was his good fortune to bur&s;t into manhood, at the moment when the country of his choice &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k off the chains with which &s;he had been manacled for centuries. There was al&s;o &s;omething in his manners and habits that announced him equal to the &s;ituation for which he &s;eems to have been de&s;tined; in&s;tead of imitating the frivolity of the age, his mind was continually occupied by u&s;eful &s;tudies; and from the Lives of Plutarch, a volume of which he always carried in his pocket, he learned, at an early age, to copy the manners, and emulate the actions, of antiquity.</P>

With this di&s;po&s;ition, it is but little wonder that he &s;hould have dedicated his life to the profe&s;&s;ion of arms. We accordingly find him, while yet a boy, pre&s;enting him&s;elf as a candidate for a commi&s;&s;ion in the artillery; and his &s;ucce&s;s equalled the expectati|ons of his friends, for he was the 12th on the li&s;t, out of the 36, who proved victorious in the conte&s;t.

<P>In the mean time, a &s;cheme was forming for the annexation of Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a to the crown of England; and the cabinet, in an <HI>evil hour,</HI> acceded to a propo&s;ition which while it dimini&s;hed the wealth, has contribu|ted but little either to the honour or advantage of that country.</P>
<P>Buonaparte had a difficult part to act upon this occa&s;ion; he was per&s;onally attached to Pa&s;quale Paoli; he re&s;ented the treatment he experienced du|ring the reign of the <HI>Terrori&s;ts,</HI> and had actually drawn up, with his own hand, the remon&s;trance tran&s;mitted by the Municipality of Ajaccio again&s;t the decree declaring the General an enemy to the Commonwealth.

That town, the &s;econd &s;ea-port in France, was at this moment in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, having been ju&s;t &s;eized upon by Admiral Lord Hood, who had &s;ub&s;tituted the Briti&s;h cro&s;s in the place of the three-coloured flag. The military talents of the young Cor&s;ican were well known to Salicetti, who introduced him to Barras, to whom he afforded in|dubitable proof of the &s;incerity of his profe&s;&s;ions, at a period when &s;u&s;picion was ju&s;tified by the mo&s;t &s;e|rious and frequent defections. He was accordingly advanced from the rank of Chief de Brigade, to that of General of Artillery, and directed, under General Dugommier, the attacks of the various re|doubts that &s;urrounded and &s;trengthened this impor|tant port, in which Collot de Herbois &s;oon after de|clared, "that he had found the galley-&s;laves alone, faithful to the Republic!"&mdash;It is almo&s;t needle&s;s to add, that the energy of the French troops, added to the &s;cientific arrangements of the engineer, over|came the zeal and the re&s;i&s;tance of the motely garri|&s;on, and re&s;tored the key of the Mediterranean to France.</P>
<P>The conque&s;t of Toulon contributed not a little to rai&s;e the credit of Buonaparte; and it proved equal|ly advantageous to his friend Barras. That deputy had been al&s;o bred a military man, and was employ|ed by his colleagues on all great energies.

It was to another Cor&s;ican, however, that he confined the &s;uperintendance of the army; this was Gentili who had ju&s;t acquired a great repu|tation, by his gallant defence of Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ia.

<P>A nobler field now opened for the exertions of Bu|onaparte, for he was &s;oon after inve&s;ted with the chief command of the French army in Italy, which, under his direction, prepared to open the campaign of 1796. In the &s;pring of that year, we find the Au&s;tro-Sardinian army defeated within forty miles of Turin; 15.000 were either killed or taken pri&s;on|ers on this occa&s;ion, and the cannon and camp equi|page &s;iezed on by the victors.

The Au&s;trian General Provera was ta|ken in a third engagement; in con&s;equence of which, forty field-pieces, with the hor&s;es, mules, and artillery waggons, &amp;c. were captured by the French; 2500 of the allies killed, and 8,000 made pri&s;oners.

Au&s;trian power in Italy, and added greatly to the reputation of the French arms. On this occa&s;ion, a battalion of grenadiers bore down all before them, and reached the bridge of Lodi, &s;houting, "Long live the Republic!" but the dreadful fire kept up by the enemy having &s;topt their progre&s;s, Generals Ber|thier, Ma&s;&s;ena, Cervoni, &amp;c. ru&s;hed forward; even their pre&s;ence would have proved ineffectual, had it not been for intrepidity of Buonaparte, who &s;natch|ing a &s;tandard from the hand of a &s;ubaltern, like Cae&s;ar, on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, placed him&s;elf in front, and antimating his &s;oldiers by his actions and ge&s;ti|culations (for his voice was drowned in the noi&s;e of the cannon and mu&s;ketry) victory once more arran|ged her&s;elf under the Gallic banners.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this &s;ignal defeat, or rather &s;e|ries of victories, Beaulieu was obliged to yield the palm to a younger rival, for he felt him&s;elf reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of retreating among the mountains of Tyrol, on which the French took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greater part of Lombardy, and acquired a&s;toni&s;hing re&s;ources, and immen&s;e magazines.</P>
<P>After cro&s;&s;ing the Mincio, in the face of the Au&s;|trians, the republican army entered Verona, which &s;o lately had afforded an a&s;ylum to one of the <HI>titular</HI> kings of France, and &s;iezed on Pavia. Here a new and a more dreadful enemy attempted to &s;top the progre&s;s of the conquerers. It was Super&s;tition, clothed in cowls and &s;urplices, brandi&s;hing a poniard in one hand, and a crucifix in the other; but the &s;peedy puni&s;hment of the prie&s;ts and other adherents put an end to the in&s;urrection, and thus &s;aved Buon|aparte and his army from a more eminent danger than they had as yet experienced, and from which no French army that has hitherto cro&s;&s;ed the Alps, has been exempt.</P>
<P>At length, Mantua, alone, remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Au&s;trians, and this al&s;o was &s;oon inve&s;ted by the victors, who, at the &s;ame time, made inroads into Tyrol, and, by the battle of Reveredo, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Trent, became ma&s;ters of the pa&s;&s;es that led to Vienna.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="035113_0097_1000BECC898CC360">
In the mean time, the gallant Wurm&s;er determin|ed to &s;hut him&s;elf up, with the remainder of his di&s;pirited troops, in Mantua; and the Au&s;trians made one more grand effort, by means of General Al|vinzy, to re&s;cue his be&s;ieged army, and regain their ancient preponderance in Italy. But the battle of Arcola completely di&s;appointed their expectations, and the capture of Mantua at one and the &s;ame time concluded the campaign and their humiliation.</P>
<P>In the winter of 1796, General Buonaparte was united to Madame Beauharnois, a beautiful French|woman, who had experienced a variety of per&s;ecu|tions during the time of Robe&s;pierre. Her former hu&s;band had attained the rank of General in the &s;er|vice of the Republic, and had always conducted him&s;elf as a friend of liberty. On that memorable day, when Louis XVI, and his family, repaired to Paris, M. de Beauharnois fat as pre&s;ident of the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly, exhibited great dignity of demeanor; notwith&s;tanding this, he fell a victim to the Terro|ri&s;ts, who, joining the narrow ideas of &s;ectari&s;ts to the ferocious character peculiar to them&s;elves, per|&s;ecuted all who&s;e opinions were not exactly conform|able to their own &s;tandard.

<P>The campaign of 1797 opened under the mo&s;t au&s;picious circum&s;tances for France, as well as Spain, who was now in alliance with her; Sardinia acted a &s;ubordinate part under her control; Tu&s;cany obeyed her requi&s;itions; Naples had concluded a &s;ep|arate peace, and Rome was at her mercy. In this &s;ituation, the eyes of the Court of Vienna, and in|deed of all Europe, were turned to the Archduke Charles, who was &s;aid to inherit the military talents of the Hou&s;e of Lorraine.

<P>NO nation in Europe has experienced a greater degree o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> degeneracy than the inhabitance of modern Italy [&s;ee our account of modern Rome]. Does this proceed from Super&s;tition that degrades, Tyr|anny that deba&s;es, or a womani&s;h corruption that bur&s;ts into childi&s;h ec&s;tacies at the e&s;&s;eminate warb|lings of a <HI>Ca&s;tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o,</HI> that unmans the &s;ex in order to deceive the ear, that cuts off population to gratify the momentary longings of a debauched appetite?</P>
<P>It has been a&s;&s;erted by a re&s;pectable Traveller, that the de&s;cendants of a nation (the Greeks) which once enriched the world with the Arts and Sciences, and afforded the noble&s;t monuments of human virtue and of human &s;kill, notwith&s;tanding the cruel, de|grading yoke of the Mu&s;&s;elmans, &s;hall call to mind the greatne&s;s of their ance&s;tors. We are a&s;&s;ured, that they frequently boa&s;t that they are &s;prung from tho&s;e Greeks who are no le&s;s memorable in arts than arms, and that they not only recapitulate the fears of their progenitors, but actually point out the &s;cenes of their glory.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding very unfavourable appearances, this is al&s;o the ca&s;e with &s;ome of the modern Romans. Among them, too, it mu&s;t be remembered, fir&s;t aro&s;e the independent little Republics of Europe; and the &s;eeds of early liberty have not been entirely choked by the triple &s;ervitude of civil, religious, and foreign

domination. And the foundations of a new Repub|lic have lately been laid in a cla&s;&s;ic &s;oil, and the names of Buonaparte, Ma&s;&s;ena, Cervoni, &amp;c. may &s;erve to remind them, in &s;ome degree, of the Bru|tu&s;es, the Catos, and the Scipios of antiquity.</P>
<P>General Ma&s;&s;ena is now about 40 years of age.&mdash;He was born in Nice, at a period when it appertain|ed to the Hou&s;e of Savoy into who&s;e &s;ervice he en|tered early in life. The reproach is not peculiar to the Court of Turin, that, without courtly protec|tion, merit makes but flow progre&s;s. How many Officers of talents have we beheld in ob&s;curity, whil&s;t the &s;on of a King, or the ba&s;tard &s;on of a Lord, has been lifted to high command and rich emoluments?&mdash;It was well ob&s;erved by an Engli&s;h &s;ubaltern, that, "in order to attain a rapid promotion in the Engli&s;h army, he would rather be backed by a <HI>rotten borough</HI> than po&s;&s;e&s;s the talents of a Turenne!"</P>
<P>Ma&s;&s;ena became an En&s;ign in the Sardinian army, and an En&s;ign he might have remained to this day, had he continued in that &s;ervice. But another de&s;|tiny awaited him; he threw up his commi&s;&s;ion, and entering into a French legion, his talents &s;oon began to be di&s;tingui&s;hed.&mdash;It was at the capture of So&s;|pello that he fir&s;t developed his military talents, and it was entirely owing to him, that Saorgio, in the campaign of 1794, yielded to the French arms.

<P>In 1766, Mr. Jeffer&s;on came to the bar of the Supreme Court, and continued to practice with &s;uc|ce&s;s and reputation until the commencement of the Revolution in 1774, and the con&s;equent conclu&s;ion of the Courts of Ju&s;tice. During the period of his practice, his indu&s;trious mind &s;ound time to dige&s;t a volume of Reports of adjudged Ca&s;es in the Supreme Courts of Virginia&mdash;a book that is admitted now to be a good authority, as it is an honourable evidence of his early labours and u&s;eful talents.</P>
<P>In the year 1774, when all America was rou&s;ed into action by the uncon&s;titutional claims of the Bri|ti&s;h Government, Mr. Jeffer&s;on &s;tepped forward a bold and able champion of his country's rights, and publi&s;hed his much admired pamphlet, entitled, "A &s;ummary View of the Rights of Briti&s;h America, addre&s;&s;ed to the King," which brought again&s;t the writer threats of pro&s;ecution by Lord Dunmore, then Governor of Virginia&mdash;threats which produced no other effect on the independent mind of Mr. Jeffer|&s;on, than publicly to avow him&s;elf the author, pre|pared to meet every con&s;equence.</P>
<P>About this time, Mr. Jeffer&s;on married the daugh|ter of Mr. Wayles, an eminent lawyer, and he en|joyed much dome&s;tic felicity in the &s;ociety of one of the mo&s;t amiable of women, till the year 1780, when by her death he became the mourner of her virtues,

and the guardian of two daughters and only &s;urviv|ing i&s;&s;ue, to who&s;e education and &s;ettlement in life, he has ever &s;ince faithfully devoted him&s;elf, &s;till re|maining a widower.</P>
<P>In the year 1775, Mr. J. was elected a member of the Virginian Convention; and, on the 4th of Au|gu&s;t in the &s;ame year, one of the members to repre|&s;ent the &s;tate (then colony) of Virginia.</P>
<P>In the memorable year 1776, the natal year of American freedom and independence, Mr. Jeffer&s;on was one of a Committee of Five, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Tho. Jeffer&s;on, John Adams, Benj. Franklin, Roger Sherman, and R. Living&s;ton, appointed by Congre&s;s to draft the Declaration of Independence; and it was from the able pen and enlightened mind of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, fir&s;t named of the Committee, that ever-memorable in|&s;trument proceeded, which was reported by the Com|mittee, and unanimou&s;ly adopted by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, the ardent mind of Mr. Jeffer|&s;on, eagerly pur&s;uing the glorious principles of the Revolution, and fore&s;eeing that &s;o long as the cor|ruptions of Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tems exi&s;ted, we were inde|pendent in name, but not in fact, produced for the adoption of the Legi&s;lature, the following Acts, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. An Act to e&s;tabli&s;h religious Freedom.</P>
<P N="2">2. An Act to regulate de&s;cents, to prevent e&s;tates entail and the rights of primogeniture.</P>
<P N="3">3. An Act for the apportionment of crimes and puni&s;hments.</P>
<P N="4">4. An Act to e&s;tabli&s;h public Schools.</P>
<P>The influence of the&s;e Acts upon the relative prin|ciples they embrace, will be &s;een and felt by all tho&s;e who prize Civil Liberty as a primary ble&s;&s;ing&mdash;whil&s;t &s;y&s;tems of univer&s;al toleration in matters of religion; for an equal di&s;tribution of property, and a &s;ubver&s;ion of the unju&s;t, ari&s;tocratical principle of of entail and primogeniture right; for ameliorating the &s;anguinary code of criminal law; and for ex|tending to the poore&s;t of citizens the benefits of e|ducation; mu&s;t be viewed as the emanations of a great and good mind, zealou&s;ly endeavouring to pro|mote the happine&s;s of his fellow men.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="035113_0104_1000BEDB073E89B8">
Equally evincive of a watchful regard for the rights of his countrymen, was his &s;ugge&s;tion for the formation and adoption of the Con&s;titution of Vir|ginia, in the &s;ame year, and for prefixing thereto "A Bill of Rights, declaratory of the natural and unalienable Rights of Man"&mdash;which was according|ly done.</P>
<P>In the year 1778, Mr. Jeffer&s;on being then a mem|ber of the Virginia Legi&s;lature, pre&s;ented to that body "An Act to prevent the importation of Slaves" which was enacted into a law, and was &s;hortly after followed by another humane Act "to authorize Man|umi&s;&s;ions," being the commencement of a &s;y&s;tem of gradual emancipation, al&s;o propo&s;ed by him.</P>
<P>In the year 1779, at the age of 36, Mr. Jeffer&s;on was cho&s;en Governor of Virginia, and continued in that office until June 1781, during which the State &s;uffered by three inva&s;ions, and was al&s;o brought into a critical condition re&s;pecting its boundary lines with Penn&s;ylvania and North Carolina. His conduct in that &s;tation, amid&s;t the jarring conflicts and trying difficulties of both foreign inva&s;ion and dome&s;tic feuds, was &s;uch, as &s;ecured to him, &s;ix months after he left the office, and upon the fulle&s;t enquiry, the unanimous thanks of the Legi&s;lature, then con&s;i&s;ting of 180 members, for "his attentive admini&s;tration of the powers of the Executive while in office."</P>
<P>During the year 1781, amid&s;t the cares of govern|ment and &s;cenes of private affliction, Mr. Jef|fer&s;on prepared his celebrated work, which he mo|de&s;tly &s;tyled Notes on Virginia,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the year 1797 or 8, when the political fervor of the country had been trepanned into a wrong bias by the arts of a certain Faction, and WAR was loudly recommen|ded by high authority, a rude and wanton attack was made upon Mr. Jeffer&s;on, in Porcupine's <HI>British</HI> Gazette, by a Mr. Martin of Maryland, alledging that the celebrated &s;tory of Logan was a fabrication calculated to injure the reputation of Capt.

ju&s;tly admired for its philo&s;ophical re&s;earch, ingeni|ous theory, and able di&s;qui&s;ition, the author, in a &s;uperior &s;train of eloquence, boldly attacks and fully refutes the fallacious theories of Buffon and Raynal, which tended to di&s;parage both the man and the bea&s;t of America, and reduce them to an inferior &s;cale with tho&s;e of Europe; and vindicating the e|qual di&s;tribution of Nature's ble&s;&s;ings to this conti|nent both in the animal and vegetable creation.</P>
<P>In the year 1783, Mr. Jeffer&s;on was again appoint|ed to a &s;eat in Congre&s;s from his native &s;tate, and the the following year, on the 7th of May was nomina|ted by that hon. body Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary of the United States to the Court of France, as the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of our illu&s;trious Franklin, whither he em|barked early in the &s;ame year, and remained ab&s;ent from the United Sates, in the execution of the duties of that important tru&s;t, until the month of October, 1789, when he returned home by permi&s;&s;ion of the then Pre&s;ident, Wa&s;hington, who, upon being e|lected to the chief magi&s;tracy of the Federal Govern|ment, immediately de&s;tined Mr. Jeffer&s;on the next mo&s;t honourable and confidential &s;tation in the exe|cutive government, near his own per&s;on.</P>
<P>During his mi&s;&s;ion to France, Mr. Jeffer&s;on, with that peculiar addre&s;s, intelligence and attention to promote the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of the United States, which directs all his actions, obtained from the French King, an arrette, highly beneficial to the American commerce, for the free admi&s;&s;ion, exempt from the cu&s;tomary foreign duties, of oil, fi&s;h and whalebone, the product of the American fi&s;heries, in|to certain ports, and for the &s;ale of American built &s;hips in all the ports of France&mdash;benefits, which our Ea&s;tern brethren continued to reap the peculiar ad|vantage of, until the commencement of the revolu|tionary convul&s;ions which have, unhappily, too long agitated that country.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="035113_0106_1000BEDFEC330488">
About the &s;ame period Mr. Jeffer&s;on, in conjunc|tion with our immortal Franklin, negotiated with a Mini&s;ter from the court of Pru&s;&s;ia, then at Hague, that celebrated treaty known by the name of "The Pru&s;&s;ian Treaty," in which an a&s;toni&s;hed world has, for the fir&s;t time, &s;een a public avowal and po&s;itive provi&s;ion by treaty, between two &s;overeign and in|dependent nations, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of tho&s;e two great and glorious principles, promotive of uni|ver&s;al peace, and happine&s;s, to wit, 1&s;t. "That free &s;hips make free goods;" and, 2d. "That pri|vateering in the time of war be aboli&s;hed;" prin|ciples which it were to be wi&s;hed could be rendered univer&s;al and eternal. Mr. Adams now Pre&s;ident of the United States, was one of the commi&s;&s;ion to ne|gotiate this treaty, and on its completion, it was &s;ent over to London, where Mr. Adams then re&s;ided as mini&s;ter of the United States, for his &s;ignature. It is greatly to be regretted that Mr. Adams could not be content to retain to him&s;elf a &s;hare of the glory which reflects on the authors of this celebrated treaty. But, unhappily for our country, &s;ince he became Pre&s;ident of the United States we have &s;een him nominate his &s;on John Quincy Adams, as mini&s;|ter to the court of Pru&s;&s;ia, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e, as declared, of renewing the treaty with that na|tion, which having been limited to continue in force for ten years only, had expired. Accordingly ano|ther treaty has been made by his &s;on with Pru&s;&s;ia, which has been approved by a majority of the Senate and ratified by the Pre&s;ident, but which, in&s;tead of renewing and continuing the old treaty, is in it&s;elf a new one, expre&s;sly abandoning and renouncing the two ine&s;timable principles, 1&s;t. "That free &s;hips make free goods," and 2d. "That privateering in time of war be aboli&s;hed;" principles which, it appears, from the corre&s;pondence accompanying the negotiation, laid before the Senate of the United States by the Pre&s;ident, the wife and enlightened mini&s;ters of the Pru&s;&s;ian Monarch were brought, with great difficulty and reluctance, to abandon, on
<PB N="93" REF="035113_0107_1000BEE202AEE3C0">
the earne&s;t &s;olicitation and reiterated demand of the American negotiator, under the &s;ugge&s;tion that the maritime powers, particularly Great Britain, would never &s;anction or permit them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the allegations contained in the above paragraph, we do not &s;peak with ab&s;olute preci&s;ion&mdash;As in the colli&s;ion of party views, and in the confu&s;ion of &s;elfi&s;h repre&s;enta|tions, it is difficult to di&s;cover the truth (and which, in &s;pite of the greate&s;t political &s;agacity, often depends on contin|gent circum&s;tances) it becomes us to be diffident.&mdash;The new Treaty, which contains 37 Articles, and is to continue another ten years, has lately been publi&s;hed, and is open to the impartial inve&s;tigation of the public.&mdash;If the King of Pru&s;&s;ia obtains po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that great commercial city, Ham|burgh, the Treaty will be of more con&s;equence to America, than either Mr. Adams or his opponents at fir&s;t imagined.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the year 1789, Mr. Jeffer&s;on being returned to the United States, and appointed by Pre&s;ident Wa&s;h|ington, Secretary to the department of State, im|mediately entered on the arduous duties of that important &s;tation, having previou&s;ly &s;tipulated with the Pre&s;ident, that, on con&s;ideration of the many years ab&s;ence from his family and e&s;tate, he might be permitted at the expiration of the con&s;titutional term for which the Pre&s;ident was elected, to retire from the public &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t re&s;ult of the labours of Mr. Jeffer&s;on in the department of &s;tate, were exhibited to Congre&s;s in the following reports,&mdash;to wit,</P>
<P N="1">1. A report on the fi&s;heries of the United States.</P>
<P N="2">2. A report on coins, weights and mea&s;ures.</P>
<P N="3">3. A report on the wa&s;te and unappropriated land of the United States.</P>
<P N="4">4. A report on privileges and re&s;trictions on the commerce of the United States in foreign countries.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e reports di&s;played the u&s;ual accuracy, information, and intelligence of the writer.</P>
<P>But it was re&s;erved for a more critical and delicate period in the affairs of the United States, that the pre-eminent talents of the American Secretary &s;hould become mo&s;t con&s;picuous, and intere&s;tingly u&s;eful to his country. The non-execution of the
<PB N="94" REF="035113_0108_1000BEE443F2CDA0">
treaty of peace with the United States, on the part of Great-Britain, her detention of our We&s;tern po&s;ts, and the attendant &s;poliations on our com|merce, both by Great-Britain and France, then at war with each other, added to the <HI>intrigues</HI> of the Mini&s;ter of the latter, Genet, all conduced to a &s;itu|ation difficult and perplexing. Be&s;ides which, Spain continued to withhold from us the free navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to all We&s;tern America. In this &s;tate of things, the ju&s;t confidence, which the di&s;criminating mind of Wa&s;hington, had repo&s;ed in Mr. Jeffer&s;on, was amply repaid, by the prompt|ne&s;s, zeal and ability, with which the American Secretary, contributed, by his labours, to relieve the executive from embarra&s;&s;ment. Through a &s;ervice of ma&s;terly and unequalled diplomatique corre&s;pond|ence, which he maintained, at the &s;ame time, with the re&s;pective mini&s;ters of Great-Britain and France, namely Hammond and Genet, he traver&s;ed and re|butted their re&s;pective cau&s;es of charge and com|plaint again&s;t the United States, and having fully proved the various aggre&s;&s;ions and infractions of trea|ty on the part of their re&s;pective governments, pointed to the means of pre&s;erving the honour and maintaining the rights of his own country, whil&s;t, alike &s;uperior to the intrigues of Great Britain or of France, he fully manife&s;ted that he held no particu|lar attachment to any foreign nation, but was equal|ly prepared, with the deci&s;ion, firmne&s;s and intelli|gence of a true American, to oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t the aggre&s;&s;ions of all. The recal of Genet; and appointment of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, with the &s;ub&s;equent proceedings between the United States and France, the appointment of Mr. Jay, his treaty with Great Britain, and the recal of Mr. Hummond, the appoint|ment of Mr. Li&s;ton, and the &s;ub&s;equent proceeding with Great Britain, are all well known.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to Spain, the labours of Mr. Jeffer&s;on were more immediately effective and complete. Having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the United States then at Madrid, negotiatng a treaty with the
<PB N="95" REF="035113_0109_1000ACB08DDF3560">
Court of Spain, with the mo&s;t ample and pointed in&s;tructions, and al&s;o of the form and provi&s;ions of a treaty, predicated on the ba&s;is of the free naviga|tion of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, it remained only for Mr. Thomas Pinckney, then Mini&s;ter of the United States at London, under &s;pecial in&s;truction from the Pre&s;ident, and appointed Envoy for that purpo&s;e, to repair to Madrid, and &s;eizing the favourable moment for effecting it, to accompli&s;h this de&s;irable work. This was accordingly done, with equal promptne&s;s and deci&s;ion on his part, and jointly to that, and the labours of the American Secretary in the Cabinet, are the United States indebted for the mo&s;t liberal, honourable, and beneficial treaty, they have ever yet entered into with a foreign nation.</P>
<P>About this time, having, at the pre&s;&s;ing entreaty of the then Pre&s;ident, Wa&s;hington, remained one year longer at the head of the department of &s;tate, than he had before &s;tipulated to do, he re&s;igned his office, and retired with the warme&s;t thanks and regret of the Pre&s;ident, Wa&s;hington, to his e&s;tate at Monticello, in Albemarle county, Virginia, where he continued for upwards of two years uninterrupt|edly to enjoy the &s;weets of dome&s;tic ea&s;e, and a re&s;pite from the fatigues of public life, following with avidity his favourite pur&s;uits of philo&s;ophical re&s;earch and agricultural improvement, until the voice of his Country again &s;ummoned him to the more active &s;cenes of public duty, and placed him in nomination for the pre&s;idential chair, as the &s;ucce&s;&s;|or of Wa&s;hington. The i&s;&s;ue of that election is well known, and but for a fal&s;e return in one &s;tate, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of a return in another, Mr Jef|fer&s;on would have been declared Pre&s;ident; as the returns however &s;tood before Congre&s;s, it appears that he had 68 votes, and Mr. Adams 71, con&s;e|quently the latter was declared Pre&s;ident, and the former Vice Pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>
<P>The tongue of Party malice, which is never at re&s;t, and gives to every &s;ubject a malignant hue, perceiving Mr. Jeffer&s;on's ri&s;ing popularity, in order
<PB N="96" REF="035113_0110_1000BEE68E250090">
to prejudice the public mind, and to di&s;appoint his future election, brought forward a charge, that he was indebted to the Briti&s;h, and took mea&s;ures to di&s;appoint his creditors. This charge has been re|futed in a manner highly honourable to Mr. Jeffer|&s;on's character, by certain gentlemen in Philadel|phia, who took particular pains to inve&s;tigate the &s;ubject. Immediately after Mr. Jeffer&s;on's arrival in Virginia, in the fall of 1789, he procured a meet|ing with the Agent and the gentlemen intere&s;ted, and an amicable &s;ettlement was made in writing on the principles of his letter.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Referring to a letter from Mr. Jeffer&s;on, dated the 5th of January 1787, wherein he made amicable propo&s;als of &s;ettling and paying the demands again&s;t him, and which were accepted.&mdash;We are &s;orry we have not room for this letter, as it does much honour to his feelings and principles, be&s;ides &s;hewing the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of the country during the revolutionary war.</NOTE> Mr. Jeffer&s;on AGAIN<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eaning, that he had before paid the amount of the debt into the trea&s;ury of Virginia, agreeably to the then law of that State, which fir&s;t payment proved an entire lo&s;s to Mr. Jeffer&s;on!</NOTE> &s;old property to the amount of the debt, and, in the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t and &s;econd years, delivered over the obligations received for it to the Agent, who took on him&s;elf the collection of the money&mdash;&s;o that it is now &s;even or eight years &s;ince he paid the debt.</P>
<P>But there was another claim made by the Agent of the hou&s;e of Farrel and Jones again&s;t the execu|tors of Mr. Wayles, and another for a cargo of a|bout 4000l value, to be &s;old on commi&s;&s;ion, on ac|count of the con&s;ignees. Mr. Wayles a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;ale, but died &s;oon after, when the whole collection &s;urvived to the other con&s;ignee, who received it, wa&s;ted it, and died a bankrupt. The Agent thought he would try the chance of recovering the money from the executors of Mr. Wayles, altho' he knew they had not received it; on the trial, 11 of the jury determined again&s;t the liability of the executors, but the 12th di&s;&s;enting, the ca&s;e was laid over to the next Federal Court, when a &s;econd jury unanimou&s;|ly
<PB N="97" REF="035113_0111_1000BEE9389970E0">
concurred with the eleven of the fir&s;t, and gave a verdict for the executors, agreeably to the opinions of Judge Iredell who pre&s;ided at one hearing, and of Judge Patter&s;on who pre&s;ided at the other.</P>
<P>Perhaps there is no man in America better calcu|lated to fill the chair of &s;tate than Mr. Jeffer&s;on.&mdash;Few men who have travelled at all, have travelled with more advantage, and had a greater capacity of receiving improvement from this mode of it, than him. The genius of each nation, its particular cu&s;|toms and manners, and the great relative intere&s;ts which regulated the policy of Courts, were &s;ubjects with which he was acquainted; and eminently fit|ted him, to fill a department, the peculiar organ of their communications. Controver&s;y, which &s;o fre|quently betrays the fallibility of the under&s;tanding, becau&s;e it begets intemperance, never makes him a victim to the de&s;igns of his opponent. He li&s;tens to his argument with &s;crupulous attention; draws new &s;ources of information from conflicting princi|ples; and, if he is animated at all, it is with the di&s;covery of a new truth. There are, perhaps, few men better calculated always to triumph, and al|ways to leave upon the other's mind, at lea&s;t, the mo&s;t favourable impre&s;&s;ions, if not the mo&s;t deci&s;ive conviction. This is not difficult to account for, when applied to Mr. Jeffer&s;on; becau&s;e few men, like him, de&s;erves the application. He never hazards an opinion without the authority of experience, and the conviction of rea&s;on. Travel and ob&s;ervation have matured the one, and exten&s;ive application and reflection, have invigorated the other. His princi|ples, therefore, convey the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, which he inforces by logical deduction and mathe|matical preci&s;ion, drawing from an expanded intel|lect, that &s;eparates, with infinite facility, the purity of Truth from the gro&s;&s;er materials of Error.</P>

intrin&s;ic merit. The &s;implicity of his manners, and the re&s;ervedne&s;s of his temper, are the characteri&s;|tics of a vigorous mind, which gra&s;ps at higher ob|jects than the mere arts of plea&s;ing. Yet there is no man in private life, more amiable, none more dignified, and none who&s;e manners, po&s;&s;e&s;s, in a higher degree, the incomparable felicity of in&s;piring the combined emotions of attachment and re&s;pect. He has contemplated men and things in the different lights in which they are, and in which they &s;hould be. His reflections on this &s;ubject, are the &s;ources of his humanity and forbearance; qualifications which travel, bu&s;ine&s;s, and books, have matured into practice, and given to his mind a degree of phi|lo&s;ophical tranquility&mdash;But let not this placidity of temper, be mi&s;taken for coldne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an under&s;tanding, capable of being in|&s;pired with intrepidity, when great objects demand its energy. The American Declaration of Indepen|dence, his negotiations in &s;everal of the mo&s;t &s;ubtle cabinets of Europe, and his communications with the <HI>intriguing</HI> Mini&s;ters of France and England, while Secretary of Sate, will remain the durable memorials of a great mind, at once capable of com|bining the various qualifications of energy, pene|tration, and deliberate coolne&s;s.</P>
<P>It has been &s;neeringly &s;aid, "O, Mr. Jeffer&s;on is a Philo&s;opher,"&mdash;meaning, that from the habits of his life, he is unfit to be the Chief Magi&s;trate of an active, mixed, extended community.&mdash;If Mr. J. had all his days been &s;ecluded in a clo&s;et or a cloy&s;ter, the in&s;inuation might not be improper&mdash;We have &s;hewn the contrary; that, to the attainments of a Scholar, and the accompli&s;hments of a Gentleman, he adds the nece&s;&s;ary qualifications of a State&s;man, "one well acquainted with the world and its ways"&mdash;But we do not believe that Mr. J. him&s;elf ever &s;aid he was a Philo&s;opher; he knows too well the va&s;t dignity of the character; he is too mode&s;t and too &s;en&s;ible a man, to take upon him&s;elf a title which requires a rare a&s;&s;emblage of all the exalted qualities

<HEAD>EXTRACT from Mr. JEFFERSON'S Notes.</HEAD>
<P>In an&s;wer to the que&s;tion, What religion is in the &s;tate of Virginia?&mdash;Mr. Jeffer&s;on proceeds thus:</P>
<P>"The pre&s;ent &s;tate of our laws on the &s;ubject of Religion is this. The Convention of May 1776, in their Declaration of Rights, declared it to be a truth, and a natural right, <HI>that the exerci&s;e of Religion &s;hould be free;</HI> but when they proceeded to form on that declaration the ordinance of government, in|&s;tead of taking up every principle declared in the Bill of Rights, and guarding it by legi&s;lative &s;anc|tion, they pa&s;&s;ed over that which a&s;&s;erted our religi|ous rights, leaving them as they found them. The &s;ame Convention, however, when they met as a member of the general a&s;&s;embly in October 1776, repealed all Acts of Parliment which had rendered criminal
<PB N="101" REF="035113_0115_1000BEEFB408A208">
the maintaining any opinions in matters of religion, the forbearing to repair to church, and the exerci&s;ing any mode of wor&s;hip; and &s;u&s;pended the laws giving &s;alaries to the Clergy, which &s;u&s;pen&s;ion was made perpetual in October 1779. Statutory oppre&s;&s;ions in religion being thus wiped away, we remain at pre|&s;ent under tho&s;e only impo&s;ed by the common law, or by our own Acts of A&s;&s;embly. At the common law, <HI>Here&s;y</HI> was a capital offence, puni&s;hable by burning. Its definition was left to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical judges, before whom the conviction was, till the &s;tatute of the 1 Eliz. c. 1. circum&s;cribed it, by de|claring, "That nothing &s;hould be deemed <HI>Here&s;y,</HI> but what had been &s;o determined by authority of the Canonical Scriptures, or by one of the four fir&s;t Ge|neral Councils, or by &s;ome other Council having for the grounds of their declaration the expre&s;s and plain words of the Scriptures." Here&s;y, thus cir|cum&s;cribed, being an offence at the common law, our act of a&s;&s;embly of 1777, c. 17, gives cognizance of it to the General Court, by declaring, that the juri&s;diction of that Court, &s;hall be general in all matters at the common law. The execution is by the writ <HI>De Hoeretico comburendo.</HI> By our own act of A&s;&s;embly of 1705, c. 30, if a per&s;on brought up in the Chri&s;tian religion denies the being of a God, or the Trinity, or a&s;&s;erts there are more Gods than one, or denies the Chri&s;tian religion to be true, or the Scriptures to be of divine authority, he is puni&s;hable on the fir&s;t offence by incapacity to hold any office or employment eccle&s;ia&s;tical, civil, or military; on the &s;econd by di&s;ability to &s;ue, to take any gift or legacy, to be guardian, executor, or admini&s;trator, and by three years impri&s;onment, without bail. A father's right to the cu&s;tody of his own children being found|ed in law on his right of guardian&s;hip, this being taken away, they may of cour&s;e be &s;evered from him, and put, by the authority of a court, into more or|thodox hands.</P>

Court of Ju&s;tice cannot be relied on, reject it then, and be the &s;tigma on him. Con&s;traint may make him wor&s;e by making him a hypocrite, but it will never make him a truer man. It may fix him ob&s;tinately in his errors, but will not cure them. Rea&s;on and free enquiry are the only effectual agents again&s;t er|ror. Give a loo&s;e to them, they will &s;upport the true religion, by bringing every fal&s;e one to their tribunal, to the te&s;t of their inve&s;tigation. They are the natural enemies of error, and of error only. Had not the Roman government permitted free en|quiry, Chri&s;tianity could never have been introdu|ced. Had not free enquiry been indulged, at the aera of the Reformation, the corruptions of Chri&s;ti|anity could not have been purged away. If it be re&s;trained now, the pre&s;ent corruptions will be pro|tected, and new ones encouraged. Was the go|vernment to pre&s;cribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in &s;uch keeping as our &s;ouls are now. Thus in France the emetic was once forbidden as an article of medicine, and the potatoe as an ar|ticle of food. Government is ju&s;t as infallible too when it fixes &s;y&s;tems in phy&s;ics. Galileo was &s;ent to the Inqui&s;ition for affirming that the earth was a &s;phere: the government had declared it to be as flat as a trencher, and Galileo was obliged to abjure his error. This error however at length prevailed, the earth became a globe, and De&s;cartes declared it was whirled round on its axis by a vortex. The govern|ment in which he lived was wi&s;e enough to &s;ee that this was no que&s;tion of civil juri&s;diction, or we &s;hould all have been involved by authority in vorti|ces. In fact, the vortices have been exploded, and the Newtonian principle of gravitation is now more firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, on the ba&s;is of Rea&s;on, than it would be were the government to &s;tep in, and to make it an article of nece&s;&s;ary faith.

<HEAD>COPY of a LETTER from Mr. JEFFERSON to a Gentleman in Berkley County, dated Monticello, 4th Sept. 1800.</HEAD>
<P>"SIR,&mdash;Your favour of Augu&s;t 26th, has been duly received, and is entitled to my thankfulne&s;s for the per&s;onal con&s;iderations you are plea&s;ed to expre&s;s in it. How far the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed might have the expected effect, you can be&s;t judge; however, in the great exerci&s;e of right in which the Citizens of America are about to act, I have on mature con|&s;ideration, &s;een, that it is my duty to be pa&s;&s;ive. The intere&s;ts which they have at &s;lake are entitled to their whole attention, unbia&s;&s;ed by per&s;onal e&s;|teem or local con&s;iderations; and I am far from the pre&s;umption of con&s;idering my&s;elf equal to the awful duties of the fir&s;t magi&s;tracy of this country. That there &s;hould be differences of opinion among our fellow-citizens, is to be expected always. Men who think freely, and have the right of expre&s;&s;ing their thoughts, will differ, It is true that the&s;e dif|ferences have of late been artificially increa&s;ed; but they are now again &s;ub&s;iding to their natural level, and all will &s;oon come right if no acts of violence intervene. The great que&s;tion which divides our citizens is, whether it is &s;afe&s;t that a preponderance of power &s;hould be lodged with the monarchical, or the republican branch of our Government?&mdash;Tempo|rary panics may produce advocates for the former opinion, even in this country; but the opinion will be as &s;hort-lived as the panic with the great ma&s;s of our fellow-citizens. There is one circum&s;tance which will always bring them to rights: a prepon|derance of the executive over the legi&s;lative branch cannot be maintained but by immen&s;e patronage, by multiplying offices, making them very lucrative, by armies, navies, &amp;c. which may enli&s;t on the &s;ide of

<P>"I &s;hould be unfaithful to my own feelings were I not to lay, that it has been the greate&s;t of all human con&s;olations to me, to be con&s;idered by the republican portion of my fellow-citizens as the &s;afe depo&s;itary of their rights. The fir&s;t wi&s;h of my heart is, to &s;ee them &s;o guarded as to be &s;afe in any hands, and not to depend on the per&s;onal di&s;po&s;ition of the depo|&s;itary: and I hope this to be practicable as long as the people retain the &s;pirit of freedom. When that is lo&s;t, all experience has &s;hewn, that no forms can keep them free again&s;t their own will. But that corrupt &s;tate of mind mu&s;t be very di&s;tant in a coun|try where, for ages to come, unoccupied &s;oil will &s;till offer it&s;elf to tho&s;e who wi&s;h to reap for them|&s;elves what them&s;elves have &s;own.</P>
<P>"Our chief object at pre&s;ent &s;hould be, <HI>to reconcile the divi&s;ions which have been artificially excited, and to re&s;tore Society to its wonted harmony.</HI> Whenever this &s;hall be done, it will be found, that there are few real opponents to a Government elective at &s;hort inter|vals.

<HEAD>Mr. BURR.</HEAD>
<P>AARON BURR was born at Fairfield; he was edu|cated at Princeton College, New Jer&s;ey, of which &s;eminary his father was Pre&s;ident. In the year 1775, when he was at the age of 25, he was made Aid de Camp to General Putnam, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in &s;o eminent a manner as an able Officer, that he was &s;elected by General Wa&s;hington to be Lieu. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">Col. of one of the 12 additional Regiments. Through the whole of the war, he was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame ardent devotion to the principles of Liberty, the &s;ame courage and judgement, which mark his character at this day.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="035113_0120_1000BEFB95F24940">
At the re&s;toration of peace, having exhau&s;ted an ample patrimony in the &s;ervice of his Country, Mr. Burr found him&s;elf compelled to the profe&s;&s;ion of the Law as the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Here, notwith|&s;tanding the competition of Mr. Hamilton and other gentlemen of great talents in New York, he &s;oon ob|tained an high reputation; and the rapid fortune he acquired from an exten&s;ive practice, declared the favourable opinion of his fellow citizens. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed once more of an independent fortune, he for&s;ook the trouble&s;ome occupation of an Advocate, for one more &s;uited to his inclination, and better adapted to the di&s;play of his talents. He entered the Legi&s;lature of New York, then became a Senator of the U. States, and in both places he was equally re&s;pectable and al|ways patriotic.</P>
<P>Endowed with a mind firm, liberal, and compre|hen&s;ive, America can claim but few citizens as fit as Mr. Burr to be placed as a &s;econd in the government of the country. With an energy and deci&s;ion of character peculiar to him&s;elf, while other men are debating, he re&s;olves; while they think, he acts.&mdash;His manners are amiable, his reputation unblemi&s;h|ed. He has overthrown the dangerous influence of <HI>Foreigners</HI> in the &s;tate of New York; and, in conjunc|tion with his highly re&s;pectable compeer Mr. Jeffer|&s;on, it is hoped, that they will bani&s;h it from the national councils altogether, leaving America to be governed by its own Citizens.&mdash;In &s;hort, Mr. Burr is an uniform, con&s;i&s;tent, tried Republican.</P>
<P>We conclude this &s;hort account of Mr. Burr, with giving a place to the following extract of a letter written by him to a Member of Congre&s;s, when he learned that it was probable the votes would be e|qual for Mr. Jeffer&s;on and him&s;elf, in order to con|vince Congre&s;s in particular, and America in general, that he di&s;claimed all idea of conte&s;ting the po&s;t of honour with that Gentleman.&mdash;The letter reflects much credit on Mr. Burr, and mu&s;t rai&s;e him &s;till higher in the e&s;timation of his fellow citizens.</P>

<HEAD>PEACE BETWEEN FRANCE AND AMERICA.</HEAD>

<HEAD>FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>PARIS, Oct. 2, 1800. Ye&s;terday a treaty of Amity and Commerce between the French Republic and the United States of America, was &s;igned by the three French Mini&s;ters on one &s;ide, and by three American Commi&s;&s;ioners on the other&mdash;re&s;toring, we hope, a &s;y&s;tem of Concord between the two countries, which, as Republics, ought never to be at variance.</P>
<P>Oct. 6.&mdash;Citizen Jo&s;eph Buonaparte, Pre&s;ident of the Com|mittee of Mini&s;ters Plenipotentiary charged to negociate with the Mini&s;ters Plenipotentiary of the Un. States of Ame|rica, gave a mo&s;t &s;plendid entertainment to the&s;e Mini&s;ters, on the 3d in&s;t. at Morfontaine, to celebrate the return of an amicable under&s;tanding between the two Republics. There were pre&s;ent the three Con&s;uls, all the Mini&s;ters and mem|bers of the Corps Diplomatique, the Coun&s;ellors of State. &amp;c. and &s;everal gentlemen friends to America, among whom we ob&s;erved General La Fayette.</P>
<P>At 6 o'clock, the Mini&s;ter for foreign affairs delivered to the Fir&s;t Con&s;ul, a copy of the Convention, which was an|nounced by a di&s;charge of cannon. The dinner con&s;i&s;ted of 180 covers, &s;erved on three tables in three halls communi|cating with each other. The fir&s;t was the <HI>Hall of Union;</HI> the &s;econd and third bore the names of <HI>Franklin</HI> and <HI>Washington,</HI> and were ornamented with the bu&s;ts of the&s;e illu&s;trious cha|racters. The fir&s;t hall, however, was the mo&s;t brilliantly de|corated, pre&s;enting emblamatic devices of all the mo&s;t re|markable events of the American Revolution.</P>
<P>After dinner, &s;everal toa&s;ts were drank. The Fir&s;t Con|&s;ul gave, "To the manes of the French and Americans who died in battle for the independence of the new world."</P>
<P>The Con&s;ul Cambaceres gave, "To the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Wa&s;h|ington."</P>
<P>The Con&s;ul Lebrun gave, "To the union of America with the Powers of the North, to enforce re&s;pect to the Li|berty of the Seas."</P>
<P>After dinner were fire-works emblematic of the occa&s;ion, which were &s;ucceeded by a concert, and that was followed by a &s;pectacle, which clo&s;ed the bu&s;ine&s;s of the night.</P>
<P>On the 12th, about mid-day, the American Mini&s;ters took leave of the Chief Con&s;ul, to whom they were pre&s;ented by the Mini&s;ter of Foreign Affairs. Mr. El&s;worth, in the name of his colleagues &s;aid, "that he hoped the Convention would prove the ba&s;is of a la&s;ting friend&s;hip between France and America;" and Mr. Murray added, "that the American Mini&s;ters would neglect nothing to promote this de&s;irable

object." The Chief Con&s;ul an&s;wered, "that the differences between the two nations being adju&s;ted, there &s;hould no longer remain any trace of them; that the liberal principles, with regard to navigation, con&s;idered in the Convention, ought to be the ba&s;is of a growing intimacy; and that, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, it was more than ever the intere&s;t of the two nations clo&s;ely to adhere to them."</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ter of war to the Maritime Prefects.</P>
<P>"I make ha&s;te to inform you, Citizens, that the Con|vention of Amity and Commerce between the French and American Republics, has ju&s;t been &s;igned by the Mini&s;ters Plenipotentiary of France and the American Commi&s;&s;ioners.&mdash;I pray you to communicate this news immediately to the military Officers of the Admini&s;tration, as well as to the Commerce of your City.</P>

It is al&s;o agreed, in like manner, that the &s;ame liberty be extended to per&s;ons who are on board a free &s;hip, with this effect, that although they be enemies to either party, they are not to be taken out of that free &s;hip, unle&s;s they are &s;oldiers and in actual &s;ervice of the enemy.</P>
<P>XV. On the contrary, it is agreed, that whatever &s;hall be found to be laden by the citizens of either party on any &s;hip belonging to the enemies of the other, or their citizens, &s;hall be confi&s;cated without di&s;tinction of goods, contraband or not contraband, in the &s;ame manner as if it belonged to the enemy, except &s;uch goods and merchandize as were put on board &s;uch &s;hip before the declaration of war, or even after &s;uch declaration, if &s;o be it were done without know|ledge of &s;uch declaration; &s;o that the goods of the citizens of either party whether they be of the nature of &s;uch as are prohibited, or otherwi&s;e, as is afore&s;aid, were put on board any &s;hip belonging to an enemy before the war, or after the declaration without delay to the proprietors demanding the &s;ame, but &s;o as that if the &s;aid merchandizes be contraband, it &s;hall not be any ways lawful to carry them afterwards to any ports belonging to the enemy.</P>
<P>The two contracting parties agree, that the term of two months being pa&s;&s;ed after the declaration of war, their re&s;|pective citizens, from whatever part of the world they come, &s;hall not plead the ignorance mentioned in this article.</P>
<P>XVI. The merchant &s;hips belonging to the citizens of either of the contracting parties, which &s;hall be bound to a port of the enemy of one of the parties, and concerning who&s;e voyage, and the articles of their cargo, there &s;hall be ju&s;t grounds of &s;u&s;picion, &s;hall be obliged to exhibit, as well upon the high &s;eas as in the ports or roads, not only their pa&s;&s;ports, but likewi&s;e their certificates, &s;hewing that their goods are not of the quality of tho&s;e which are &s;pecifi|ed to be contrband in the thirteenth article of the pre&s;ent Convention.</P>

XVII. And that captures on light &s;u&s;picions may be a|voided aud injuries thence ari&s;ing prevented, it is agreed that when one party &s;hall be engaged in war, and the other, party be neuter, the &s;hips of the neutral party &s;hall be fur|ni&s;hed with pa&s;&s;ports &s;imilar to that de&s;cribed in the fourth Article, that it may appear thereby that the &s;hips really belong to the citizens of the neutral party; they &s;hall be valid for any number of voyages, but &s;hall be renewed every year, that is, if the &s;hip happens to return home in the &s;pace of a year. If the &s;hips are laden, they &s;hall be pro|vided not only with the pa&s;&s;ports above mentioned, but al&s;o with certificates &s;imilar to tho&s;e de&s;cribed in the &s;ame article, &s;o that it may be known whether they carry any contraband goods. No other paper &s;hall be required, any u&s;age or ordi|nance to the contrary notwith&s;tanding. And if it &s;hall ap|pear from the &s;aid certificates that there are contraband goods on board, the &s;hips &s;hall be permitted to proceed on their voyage. If it &s;hall appear from the certificates, that there are contraband goods on board any &s;uch &s;hip, and the commander of the &s;ame &s;hall offer to deliver them up, the of|fer &s;hall be accepted, and the &s;hip &s;hall be at liberty to pur&s;ue its voyage, unle&s;s the quantity of the contraband goods be greater than can conveniently be received on board the &s;hip of war or privateer, in which ca&s;e the &s;hip may be carried into port for the delivery of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>If any &s;hip &s;hall not be furni&s;hed with &s;uch pa&s;&s;port or certificates as above required for the &s;ame, &s;uch ca&s;e may be examined by a proper judge or tribunal, and if it &s;hall appear from other documents or proofs, admi&s;&s;ible by the u&s;age of nations, that the &s;hip belongs to the citizens of the neu|tral party, it &s;hall not be confi&s;cated, but &s;hall be relea&s;ed with her cargo (contraband goods excepted) and be permitted to proceed on her voyage.</P>
<P>If the ma&s;ter of a &s;hip, named in the pa&s;&s;port, &s;hould happen to die or be removed by any other cau&s;e, and ano|ther put in his place, the &s;hip and cargo &s;hall neverthele&s;s be equally &s;ecure, and the pa&s;&s;port remain in full force.</P>
<P>XVIII.

And it is expre&s;sly agreed that the neutral party &s;hall in no ca&s;e be required to go on board the examining

<P>XX. In all ca&s;es where ve&s;&s;els &s;hall be captured or detained under pretence of carrying to the enemy contraband goods, the captor &s;hall give a receipt for &s;uch of the papers of the ve&s;&s;el as he &s;hall retain, which receipt &s;hall be annexed to a de&s;criptive li&s;t of the &s;aid papers: and it &s;hall be unlawful to break up or open the hatches, che&s;ts, trunks, ca&s;ks, bales, or ve&s;&s;els found on board, or remove the &s;malle&s;t part of the goods, unle&s;s the lading be brought on &s;hore in pre|&s;ence of the competent officers, and an inventory made by them of the &s;aid goods.

<P>XXI. And that proper care may be taken of the ve&s;&s;el and cargo, and embezzlement prevented, it is agreed, that it &s;hall not be lawful to remove the ma&s;ter, commander or &s;upercargo of any captured &s;hip from on board thereof, ei|ther during the time the &s;hip may be at &s;ea after her capture, or pending the proceedings again&s;t her, or her cargo, or any thing relative thereto. And in all ca&s;es where a ve&s;&s;el of the citizens of either party &s;hall be captured, or &s;eized, and held for adjudication, her officers, pa&s;&s;engers and crew &s;hall be ho&s;pitably treated.

<P>XXII. It is further agreed, that in all ca&s;es, the e&s;tabli&s;hed courts for prize cau&s;es, in the country to which the prizes may be conducted, &s;hall alone take cognizance of them.

And whenever &s;uch tribunal of either of the parties &s;hall pronounce judgement again&s;t any ve&s;&s;el or goods, or property claimed by the citizens of the other party, the &s;entence or decree &s;hall mention the rea&s;ons or motives on which the &s;ame &s;hall have been founded, and an authenticated copy of the &s;entence or decree, and of all the proceedings in the ca&s;e, &s;hall, if demanded, be delivered to the commander or agent of the &s;aid ve&s;&s;el, without any delay, he paying the legal fees for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>XXIII. And that more abundant care may be taken for the &s;ecurity of the re&s;pective citizens of the contracting par|ties, and to prevent their &s;uffering injuries by the men of war or privateers of either party, all commanders of &s;hips of war and privateers, and all others the &s;aid citizens, &s;hall forbear doing any damage to tho&s;e of the other party, or committing any outrage again&s;t them, and if they act to the contrary they &s;hall be puni&s;hed, and &s;hall al&s;o be bound in per&s;ons and e&s;tates to make &s;atisfaction and reparation for all damages and the intere&s;t thereof, of whatever nature the &s;aid damages may be.</P>
<P>For this cau&s;e all commanders of privateers before they re|ceive their commi&s;&s;ions, &s;hall hereafter be obliged to give, be|fore a competent judge, &s;ufficient &s;ecurity by at lea&s;t two re|&s;pon&s;ible &s;ureties, who have no intere&s;t in the &s;aid privateer, each of whom, together with the &s;aid commander, &s;hall be jointly and &s;everally bound in the &s;um of 7000 dollars, or 36,820 francs, or if &s;uch &s;hips be provided with above 150 &s;eamen or &s;oldiers, in the &s;um of 14000 dollars, or 73,640 f. to &s;atisfy all damages and injuries which the &s;aid privateer, or her officers or men, or any of them may do or commit during their crui&s;e, contrary to the tenor of this Convention or to the laws and in&s;tructions for regulating their conduct; and further, that in all ca&s;es of aggre&s;&s;ions, the &s;aid com|mi&s;&s;ion &s;hall be revoked and annulled.</P>
<P>XXIV. When the &s;hips of war of the two contracting parties, or tho&s;e belonging to their citizens which are arm|ed in war, &s;hall be admitted to enter with their prizes the ports of either of the two parties, the &s;aid public or private &s;hips, as well as their prizes, &s;hall not be obliged to pay any duty either to the officers of the place, the judges, or any others; nor &s;hall &s;uch prizes, when they come to and enter the ports of either party, be arre&s;ted or &s;eized, nor &s;hall the officers of the place make examination concerning the law|fulne&s;s of &s;uch prizes, but they may hoi&s;t &s;ail at any time, and depart and carry their prizes to the places expre&s;&s;ed in their commi&s;&s;ions, which the commanders of &s;uch &s;hips of war &s;hall be obliged to &s;hew.

<P><PB N="119" REF="035113_0133_1000ADA1EAF23B70">
XXV.

<P>And all their &s;hips, with the goods or merchandizes taken by them and brought into the port of either of the &s;aid par|ties, &s;hall be &s;eized as far as they can be di&s;covered, and &s;hall be re&s;tored to the owners, or their factors or agents duly authorized by them (proper evidence being fir&s;t given before competent judges for proving the property), even in ca&s;e &s;uch effects &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed into other hands by &s;ale, if it be proved that the buyers knew, or had good rea&s;on to believe, or &s;u&s;pect, that they had been piratically taken.</P>
<P>XXVII. Neither party will intermeddle in the fi&s;heries of the other on its coa&s;ts, nor di&s;turb the other in the exerci&s;e of the rights which it now holds, or may acquire, on the coa&s;t of Newfoundland, in the Gulph of St. Lawrence, or el&s;ewhere on the American coa&s;t northward of the United States. But the whale and &s;eal fi&s;heries &s;hall be free to both in every quarter of the world.</P>
<P>This Convention &s;hall be ratified on both &s;ides in due form, and the Ratifications exchanged in the &s;pace of &s;ix months, or &s;ooner, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>In faith whereof, the re&s;pective Plenipotentiaries have &s;igned the above Articles both in the French and Engli&s;h languages, and they have thereto affixed their &s;eals; de|claring neverthele&s;s that the &s;igning in the two languages &s;hall not be brought into precedent, nor in any way operate to the prejudice of either party.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>CITY of WASHINGTON, <DATE>Nov. 17, 1800.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>The Legi&s;lature of the United States of America meet this day. As they are the grand depo&s;itory of national confi|dence, to whom are entru&s;ted powers, on the correct exerci&s;e of which the public felicity greatly depends, it is natural that a general &s;olicitude &s;hould accompany their delibera|tions. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the power of pre&s;erving peace or declaring war, of increa&s;ing or dimini&s;hing taxes, the welfare of the community, on points of the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive in|tere&s;t, cannot fail to be as much promoted by an enlighten|ed, as it would be injured by a contracted policy.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance which leads us to hope, that Congre&s;s commences its proceedings in the new Capital at an au&s;picious period.&mdash;The unfortunate differences which have too long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the French and American Republics, are, we tru&s;t, nearly terminated; and that the two countries, fitted by their forms of government, to be on amicable terms, will henceforth be on terms of concord and harmony.&mdash;With re&s;pect to the nature of the Treaty, no one will imagine, that the American Envoys, either from parti|ality or prejudice, will have conferred any advantages on France, nor dictated by a &s;crupulous adherence to the prin|ciples of a ju&s;t reciprocity. The &s;entiments they are known to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and their high re&s;pectability and integrity, are &s;ufficient pledges of their upright conduct.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ervation of peace is &s;o plainly and unequivocally the policy of Republics, and &s;o peculiarly the policy of <HI>this</HI> Country, that every true friend to its pro&s;perity will rejoice in an honourable termination of di&s;putes, that hazarded its tranquility at home, and di&s;turbed its relations abroad.</P>
<P>The American people are not aver&s;e to war, becau&s;e they fear to try their &s;trength with any foe that menaces their rights&mdash;but they deprecate war as one of the greate&s;t cur&s;es inflicted upon mankind. Knowing that it renders nations depraved, and governments de&s;potic, they view it as the in&s;trument of Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion&mdash;as &s;uch, they do well to be jealous of their Rulers, and by an un&s;leeping vigilance, to re&s;train that &s;pirit of encroachment and domination which Ambition is perpetually prompting&mdash;Nothing can be in is clearly expre&s;&s;ed by the late elections, from one end of the Union to the other, than the marked ho&s;tility of the pub|lic mind to war with any nation, unle&s;s forced upon the country by dire nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Among the immediate benefits which may be expected to flow from the altered &s;tate of our affairs, is a repeal of cer|tain laws, who&s;e only apology was looked for in "the war|like attitude of the country."&mdash;And may we not entertain a &s;incere wi&s;h for the revocation of the Alien Law, who&s;e ex|i&s;tence has, in all probability, with-held from our country

Taxes, under mo&s;t governments, are a nece&s;&s;ary evil; but, in a Republic, where the Rulers are wi&s;e and hone&s;t, they cea&s;e to be a grievance.

<HEAD>The Committee of Ways and Means, who were in&s;tructed to enquire into the expedincy of repealing the "Act to provide for the Valuation of Lands and dwelling Hou&s;es, and the Enumeration of Slaves within the United States,"</HEAD>
<P>Report, That the valuation of lands and dwelling hou&s;es has not yet been completed in all the States; and to repeal the law before that object is accompli&s;hed, would, in its effect, defeat the direct tax in tho&s;e States where the valuation re|mains incompleat.</P>
<P>That one great object contemplated at the time of pa&s;&s;ing the law, and which it is pre&s;umed &s;till exi&s;ts, was to organize a &s;y&s;tem for laying direct taxes, to which the legi&s;lature might re&s;ort if the exigencies of government &s;hould require more re|venue than could conveniently be drawn from indirect taxes; and to relinqui&s;h this object, after the expence of accompli&s;h|ing it has been incurred, might be a proof of in&s;tability, but not of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>That the expence of procuring the di&s;tribution and transfer of real e&s;tates to be recorded in the &s;urveyor's office, incurred by individuals, is, in the opinion of the Committee, an object of little importance when oppo&s;ed to the advantages ari&s;ing from a public record of titles, and the more important advan|tages which the government will derive from the &s;y&s;tem, if any event &s;hould render a direct tax nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Although it is to be hoped that no further direct taxes will become nece&s;&s;ary, yet, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to pronounce, with

<HEAD>REPORT of the Select Committee, to whom were referred Mr. NICHOLAS'S propo&s;ed Amendment to the Con&s;titu|tion in relation to the made of electing a Pre&s;ident and Vice Pre&s;ident, and Members of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives.</HEAD>
<P>The Committee to whom were referred the foregoing Re|&s;olutions, have had the &s;ame under their con&s;ideration, and as the re&s;ult of that con&s;ideration, beg leave to make the following Report:</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="035113_0140_1000ACE01FA4C8C8">
It is conceived that it may be a&s;&s;umed as one of the mo&s;t indi&s;putable maxims of <HI>American policy,</HI> that no charge in the Con&s;titution of the United States be admitted, without a well grounded a&s;&s;urance of the attainment of &s;ome great|er good under the propo&s;ed change, than under the exi&s;ting provi&s;ions of the Con&s;titution</P>
<P>In relation to the object of the fir&s;t of the afore&s;aid Re|&s;olutions, the exi&s;ting provi&s;ions of the Con&s;titution of the United States are in the following terms:&mdash;(The Com|mittee here quote the Con&s;titution, and then go on to argue again&s;t the Re&s;olution.)</P>
<P>A mode of electing the Pre&s;ident and Vice-Pre&s;ident of the United States, which might at once combine the expre&s;&s;ion of the public &s;entiments of the people of the re&s;pective &s;tates, with a due appointment of the electors for that important purpo&s;e, is a di&s;covery greatly to be de&s;ired; that &s;uch mode may be found, under the pre&s;ent provi&s;ions of the con&s;titu|tion of the United States, and will be di&s;covered by the good &s;en&s;e of the American people, when aided by further experi|ence, is confidently hoped&punc; Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, to adopt exclu&s;ively the mode propo&s;ed by the fir&s;t re&s;olution re|ferred to your committee, might not only preclude the advan|tages of further experience and the adoption of a more eli|gible made, but might tend to perpetuate, as well as to ren|der more frequent the occurrence of tho&s;e exceptionable incidents which have been before &s;ugge&s;ted, and for which it is difficult, if not impracticable, to find adequate and con|venient means of prevention or remedy.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations induce your Committee to prefer the exi&s;ting provi&s;ions of the Constitution of the United States, to the change propo&s;ed by the fir&s;t of the re&s;olution, refer|red to them.</P>
<P>In relation to the &s;econd Re&s;olution referred to your Committee, they report that the objects directly contemplated therein, are already within the limits of the legi&s;lative au|thority of the government of the United States. To con|vert a con&s;titutional provi&s;ion for the exerci&s;e of legi&s;lative authority, to which recurrence may be had at all times, and under which &s;uch modifications may be introduced, from time to time, as the public good and convenience may re|quire in the ordinary forms of legi&s;lation, into a &s;pecific con&s;titutional pre&s;cription, &s;eems to be both &s;uperfluous and inconvenient.</P>
<P>The adoption of the plan propo&s;ed in the &s;econd Re&s;olu|tion, would al&s;o, in the opinion of your committee, indirect|ly tend to withdraw from the government of the United States, its exi&s;ting controul over the appointment of one of its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential branches, and to ve&s;t that authority exclu|&s;ively in the &s;tate Governments. Such arrangement might

produce con&s;equences not contemplated, and too unplea&s;ant to be anticipated. Your Committee therefore conceive it to be inexpedient to adopt the propo&s;ed change on this &s;ubject, and &s;ubmit the following re&s;olutions to the con&s;ideration of the Hou&s;e</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That it is inexpedient to change the Con&s;titu|tion of the United States, in the manner propo&s;ed by the fir&s;t of the afore&s;aid re&s;olutions, in relation to the election of the Pre&s;ident <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Vice-Pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>

<P>"From whence it re&s;ults (&s;ay the Committee) that if the amount of Debt in Jan. 1800 is compared with that 1791, the debt has <HI>diminished</HI> 3,972,878<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">drs, and 66 cents.</P>
<P>"The Committee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it important to add, that the ex|traordinary expence which has ari&s;en within a few years, has &s;wallowed up large &s;ums of the public wealth, and di|verted the application of tho&s;e monies which might otherwi&s;e have gone to the extinguishment of the public debt, to objects connected with the honour, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, with the im|mediate exi&s;tence of the Government</P>
<P>"In this cla&s;s of expence will be included a large &s;um oc|ca&s;ioned by the Indian war&mdash;one million two hundred and fif|ty thou&s;and dollars, expended in quelling two in&s;urrections in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania&mdash;more than one million and an half expended in our tran&s;actions with Algiers and the other Med|iterranean powers, together with a much larger expence occa|&s;ioned by the unprovoked aggre&s;&s;ions of France upon this country. Had it been po&s;&s;ible, &s;teadily to have applied tho&s;e various &s;ums to the purcha&s;e of debt, it is ea&s;ily to conceive how rapidly the &s;ame might have been extinguished&mdash;The committee have likewi&s;e, noticed the large &s;ums which have been nece&s;&s;arily expended in the erection of lighthou&s;es, re|pairing

The money expended on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e objects, it is well known, ari&s;es to a very large amount, and the property thus acquired by the government, and which is now on hand, cannot be e&s;timated, on the mo&s;t mo|derate calculations, at a &s;um le&s;s than four millions of dol|lars. The value of this property might be con&s;idered as com|po&s;ing another item in the credit of the general account of debt, but the Committee have not thought it nece&s;&s;ary to in|clude it, and have noticed it particularly at this time, for the purpo&s;e of exhibiting a more general view of the extraordi|nary expence incurred by the government, and for the purpo&s;e pre&s;enting all that information, in relation to the debt, which will enable the Hou&s;e accurately to appreciate the great and increa&s;ing re&s;ources of the country; and on this point the committee cannot forbear to remark, that the progre&s;s of the government, in its financial operations, mu&s;t afford the mo&s;t flattering pre&s;ages of its future &s;ucce&s;s, if the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem is pur&s;ued which has hitherto proved &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>"It cannot certainly be unworthy of remark that ten years have not at this time elap&s;ed &s;ince the government fairly commenced its operations; that during that period it has been nece&s;&s;ary to liquidate, to fund and to provide for a large capital of floating debt which has grown out of the di&s;or|ders of the Confederation; that during the &s;ame &s;hort period the government has been compelled to contend with one ex|pen&s;ive war on the frontier, with two in&s;urrections in the centre of our country, and with depredation and ho&s;tility from the nations of Europe; that the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments have neverthele&s;s been faced by the government; mo&s;t of the difficulties have been &s;urmounted; the debt has been liqui|dated and dimini&s;hed, and the nation has &s;till continued to increa&s;e in wealth and population beyond all former exam|ple; and although the conte&s;t in which we are now engaged, may, for a &s;hort period, retard the further extingui&s;hment of debt, or perhaps produce a &s;mall addition to that which al|ready exi&s;ts, yet it cannot be doubted, that whil&s;t we retain order at home, no exterior circum&s;tances can exhau&s;t or greatly dimini&s;h the increa&s;ing re&s;ources of the nation."</P>
<P>We have thus impartially &s;tated, as far as our limits will allow, the different &s;ums at the different periods, as repre|&s;ented by the Committee. It is probable &s;ome of our read|ers may be puzzled between the <HI>nominal</HI> and <HI>true</HI> amounts; indeed the Report &s;ays, that "there was a difference of opi|nion in the Committee,"* therefore the debt is &s;tated both ways&mdash;"When Doctors differ, who &s;hall decide?"</P>

<P>"The Secretary of the Trea&s;ury (&s;ays Mr. G.) in a letter to the Committee of Ways and Means, dated Jan. 1800, gave it as his opinion, "that the principal of the public debt had <HI>increased,</HI> &s;ince the e&s;tablishment of the pre&s;ent Government, in the &s;um of 1,516,338 dollars."

<P>"The different re&s;ults exhibited by the Secretary in Janu|ary, and by the Committee in May, &s;hew that the &s;ubject may be con&s;idered in different ways, embracing not only mat|ters of fact, but que&s;tions of opinion. Whether the view taken by the Committee is correct or not, is to be decided by rea&s;oning; and their Report, not being confined, as &s;eems to have been intended by the Hou&s;e, to <HI>matters of fact,</HI> mu&s;t be con&s;idered only as the <HI>opinion</HI> of a few individuals.&mdash;It is in|tended, in this E&s;&s;ay, to examine &s;ome of the facts contained in the Trea&s;ury &s;tatements, to di&s;cu&s;s the grounds of the <HI>opi|nion</HI> of the Committee, and to add &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the financial operations of the government of the United States."&mdash;(Mr. G. then proceeds to examine the facts in a variety of calculations, which are too lengthy for our book, but which we recommend to the &s;erious peru&s;al of tho&s;e who are de&s;irous of being acquainted with the financial affairs of the United States&mdash;We therefore &s;elect from a variety of tables what we think are his conclu&s;ive &s;tatements.)</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Mr. WEST, the celebrated American Arti&s;t in London, to Mr. King the American Mini&s;ter at the Briti&s;h Court, on the &s;ubject of a Monument to be erected to the Memory of General Wa&s;hington.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>May 25, 1800.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OBSERVING the Re&s;olutions pa&s;&s;ed by the United States of America, for removing the body of GEORGE WASHINGTON from the family vault to the city bearing his name, and their intention to rai&s;e an appropriate monument to his memory in that city, I thought the following ob&s;erva|tions, with the plan for a monument from me as an Ameri|can and one not altogether ob&s;cure in the elegant ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, might be acceptable to tho&s;e in that country, who are de&s;irous of paying the la&s;t tribute to his memory, by a monumental re|cord, placed in the Federal City.</P>
<P>The rai&s;ing of monuments to departed virtue, has ever been an object of the fir&s;t attention in all civilized countries, and no people ever had &s;o proud an in&s;tance in doing this as the Americans, by rai&s;ing one to true virtue and real worth, as that which pre&s;ents it&s;elf to them in the character of Gen|eral Wa&s;hington, and that the placing of &s;uch records in public &s;ituations has ever been con&s;idered true policy, by all wi&s;e governments, for which the highways, &s;quares and cir|cu&s;es for &s;uch records have been preferred, we have the highe&s;t authority from the Egyptians, Grecians, and Ro|mans.&mdash;That the rai&s;ing of a monument to the memory of General Wa&s;hington, I believe, is the wi&s;h of all the civili|zed world. I do therefore recommend, that the mo&s;t durable form for &s;uch a monument be adopted, which is, that of the Triangle or Pyramid, and that its &s;ituation be the mo&s;t con|&s;picuous in the Federal City; its height one hundred and fifty feet, and its ba&s;is the &s;ame. The place or &s;quare, where it is erected, to be planted with trees to give inviting &s;hade, and to be opened to the public: this will afford the parent or tutor an opportunity to inculcate the virtues of that great man, in the juvenile mind of the ri&s;ing offspring. The in|&s;ide of the pyramid has a conic cavity to &s;ave the expence in building, and at the &s;ame time gives as much &s;trength as though &s;olid; within that is built a rotundo, lighted from the top, in which is placed the pede&s;trian &s;tatue of the Gene|ral in bronze, to be in height not le&s;s than &s;even feet, and round the rotundo eight ba&s;&s;o-relievos in the &s;ame metal, four containing military, and four civil &s;ubjects. In place of the frize and dado round the rotundo, a grove to be cut, to a con&s;iderable depth, and in the &s;ame manner round the eight ba&s;&s;o-relievos. This will give a monumental &s;implicity, which belongs to its character, and the whole of the apart|ment to be the natural colour of the &s;tone with which it is built; one of the four entrances into the rotundo to be clo&s;ed,
<PB N="145" REF="035113_0159_1000ACF8E506FD18">
for the place where the remains of that great man &s;hould be depo&s;ited in a &s;tone coffin, which &s;hould be elevated, and under it a proper in&s;cription. The three entrances which lead into the rotundo, to have iron gates, to be opened on fixed days, for &s;eeing the &s;epulchre. Such a monument would be an appropriate one to the exalted character of George Washington, and worthy the United States of A|merica to rai&s;e to his memory. It &s;hould &s;tand pre-eminent in magnitude, as the character it records &s;tood pre-eminent in virtue, as well as to give a ta&s;te to any monuments that may in future be erected&mdash;it will both adorn the City, and in&s;pire the people with virtue from generation to generation, for thou&s;ands of years.</P>
<P>The better to elucidate the con&s;truction of &s;uch a monu|ment, I &s;end you the plan, &s;ection, and elevation; they are goemetrical, and laid down to a &s;cale&punc; The e&s;timate of &s;uch a monument in erecting, the workmen in America will be able to a&s;certain, as the whole is to be of &s;tone. The works of art, &s;uch as the &s;tatue and ba&s;&s;o-relievos, their expence will be a&s;certained in Europe, agreeable to &s;imilar works.</P>

<P>At the opening of the A&s;&s;embly, the Governor &s;ent a let|ter (along with other communications) dated 1&s;t Dec. 1800, of which the following is the &s;ub&s;tance:&mdash;His Excllency notices the &s;tate of the Penitentiary Hou&s;e, which he thinks ought to be &s;trengthened and &s;urrounded with an external wall, &amp;c.&mdash;Mentions the Marine Ho&s;pital at Norfolk, to be ceded to the United States on certain conditions; al&s;o, a cer|tain tract of land called Go&s;port, "as &s;oon as he &s;hould be &s;atisfied the United States were willing to pay the amount, at which the &s;aid tract &s;hould be valued by agents appointed by each party."&mdash;He takes notice of the contagious di&s;ea&s;e which lately afflicted Norfolk and Baltimore, and the mea|&s;ures he took to enforce quarantine, &amp;c.&mdash;He recites the pro|ceedings
<PB N="153" REF="035113_0167_1000BF4268BE0208">
taken in regard to the Act for appointing Electors to chu&s;e a Pre&s;ident and Vice-Pre&s;ident of the United States, and "the chearfulne&s;s with which &s;aid Law was received and executed by the patriotic Citizens of this State."&mdash;The paragraphs concerning the Alien and Sedition Laws, and that touching the conduct of a certain Magi&s;trate in Nor|folk, we &s;hall in&s;ert verbatim, for the information of our Readers:&mdash;</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as the requi&s;ite number of copies of the Report of the Select Committee of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion on the An&s;wers of &s;everal of the &s;tates to the Re&s;olutions of the General A&s;&s;embly, which pa&s;&s;ed at the preceding Se&s;&s;ion, relative to the Alien and Sedition Laws of the United States, and the In&s;tructions to the Senators of this State in the Congre&s;s of the United States were printed, the Executive ha&s;tened to di&s;tribute them among the &s;everal Counties of the Common|wealth, in compliance with the Re&s;olution of the 20th of January la&s;t. It is believed, that no public documents illu&s;|trative of public tran&s;actions, however intere&s;ting, were ever more generally read or thoroughly approved, than the&s;e were; nor can it be doubted that the light which they communicated on the very important &s;ubject to which they referred, tended to increa&s;e in a high degree, the confidence of the good people of this Commonwealth, in the wi&s;dom and rectitude of the policy which governed the General A&s;|&s;embly. In connection with that &s;ubject it is proper to add, that &s;ince your la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, the Sedition Law, one of the Acts complained of, has been carried into effect in this Commonwealth, by the deci&s;ion of a Federal Court.&mdash;I no|tice this event, not with a view of cen&s;uring, or even criti|ci&s;ing it. The tran&s;action has gone to the world, and the impartial, will judge of it, as it de&s;erves. I notice it for the purpo&s;e of remarking, that the deci&s;ion was executed with the &s;ame order and tranquil &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the part of the peo|ple, as could have been &s;hewn by them on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion to any the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, con&s;titutional, and popular Acts of the Government. The con&s;titutional authorities and the good people of this Commonwealth, are attached to the U|nion, and cheri&s;h it with their fonde&s;t wi&s;hes. The coloni|zation of their ance&s;tors in this We&s;tern world, was gener|ally from the &s;ame country, at the &s;ame time, and produced by the &s;ame cau&s;e; they alike groaned under an oppre&s;&s;ion which repre&s;&s;ed their growth and checked their pro&s;perity:&mdash;they fought and bled in the &s;ame battles, in defence of the &s;ame rights, and have &s;ince experienced, with unexampled harmony and unanimity, a variety of new and intere&s;ting occurrences which admoni&s;h them, they &s;till are and ought to remain forever united. The General A&s;&s;embly, and the good people of this Commonwealth, have acquitted them|&s;elves
<PB N="154" REF="035113_0168_1000BF44C935A2B0">
to their own con&s;ciences, and to their brethren in America, in &s;upport of a cau&s;e, which they deemed a na|tional one, by the &s;tand they made, and the &s;entiments they expre&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e acts of the General Government; but they have looked for a change in that re&s;pect, to a change in the public opinion which ought to be free, not to mea&s;ures of violence, di&s;cord and di&s;union, which they abhor."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Some time in April la&s;t I was advi&s;ed by a re&s;pectable citizen in Norfolk, that a Magi&s;trate of that Borough had received from the Captain of the Con&s;tellation, a frigate of the United States, a per&s;on &s;aid to be one of the mutineers on board his Britannic Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Hermione; that he committed the &s;aid per&s;on to jail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> with an order to the jailor to &s;urrender him to the Briti&s;h Con&s;ul, on his application; that he was &s;urrendered accordingly to the &s;aid con&s;ul, who &s;ent him to a Briti&s;h I&s;land where he was executed. A con|duct &s;o extraordinary as that alledged, could not otherwi&s;e than excite the a&s;toni&s;hment of the Executive. Every man within the jurisdiction of the &s;tate, is under certain excep|tions, amenable to its laws and entitled to its protection. If he commits an offence again&s;t the &s;overeignty, or other rights of the United States; he is amenable to their go|vernment and laws for the infraction. But the act which was denounced did not appear to proceed from, or to be &s;anction|ed by the authority of that government. To de&s;ignate a man within the juri&s;diction of a &s;tate, as one not entitled to its protection, or that of the United States, to dive&s;t him of &s;uch protection, and &s;urrender him to a foreign power, to be &s;ent abroad, tried, condemned, and executed, by the &s;en|tence of a foreign tribunal, are important acts of &s;overeign|ty, in which the character and agency of the chief public functionaries &s;hould be &s;een and for which they are highly re&s;pon&s;ible. But nothing of the kind appeared in the pre|&s;ent in&s;tance. No re&s;pectful, though &s;trict analy&s;is, by the competent authority, of the re&s;pective claims to juri&s;diction, between the &s;tate and the United States, with re&s;pect to the fugitive, who &s;ought an a&s;ylum here; no circum&s;pect ex|amination of treaties between the United States and a foreign power, which ought to precede an act derogating in &s;ome re&s;pects from the national &s;overeignty, were heard of. The magi&s;trate who acted was not even an officer of the federal government, but of this &s;tate, in which light, he was in a peculiar degree re&s;pon&s;able to its authority. The act was &s;tated to be &s;ummary and peremptory, and &s;trictly that of the magi&s;trate him&s;elf. As however this communication compromitted the character of a con&s;ul of a foreign power, and an officer of the United States, as well as that of a magi|&s;trate of this Commonwealth, the Executive was careful to ob&s;erve in the part it took, the utmo&s;t deference to the rights
<PB N="155" REF="035113_0169_1000BF474E410C40">
of tho&s;e who were to be affected by it. The information was given in writing by a re&s;pectable citizen, but yet that did not &s;eem to be an evidence &s;ufficiently formal and au|thentic, to ju&s;tify a prompt proceeding under it. It was deemed more con&s;i&s;tent with the principles of ju&s;tice, and becoming the character of a free State, to cau&s;e the verity of the&s;e charges to be a&s;certained by affidavit, with due notice to the parties before any &s;tep was taken. And as the Attor|ney General was nece&s;&s;arily engaged in public bu&s;ine&s;s in one of the &s;uperior courts at the time, that tru&s;t was com|mitted to George Hay, a citizen of merit and talents, by whom it was executed, with that degree of judgement and propriety its delicacy and importance required. I am &s;orry to add that the re&s;ult of the enquiry did not dimini&s;h the pre&s;umption that the charges alledged were true. It was deemed of &s;ufficient force to impo&s;e on the Executive an obligation, to refer the &s;ubject to the Attorney General, with a reque&s;t that he would take &s;uch mea&s;ures in reference to the tran&s;action as in his judgement might be &s;uitable. I &s;ubmit a copy of all the papers nece&s;&s;ary to give a full view of this intere&s;ting occurrence to the General A&s;&s;embly; with who&s;e wi&s;dom it will remain to determine, whether any further provi&s;ion ought to be made by law for &s;imilar offen|ces in future."</P>

<HEAD>Copy of Mr. LEE'S Letter, referred to in Governor Mon|roe's Addre&s;s to the Legi&s;lature:</HEAD>
<P>SIR,&mdash;Without apology for my not being per&s;onally known to you, I take the liberty of addre&s;&s;ing to you as chief magi&s;trate of the Commonwealth of Virginia, on a &s;ubject in my judgement highly intere&s;ting to the liberty and happine&s;s of my fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>Some time in the &s;pring of la&s;t year, Captain Truxton, of the Con&s;tellation frigate, &s;ent to Doctor J. K. Read, one of the aldermen of the borough of Norfolk, a man who HE &s;aid had acknowledged him&s;elf one of the mutineers on board the Hermione frigate; the man was committed to jail, &s;ub|ject to the order of the Briti&s;h con&s;ul, by him taken out, &s;ent to Jamaica, and there executed. This information is from Dr. Read him&s;elf, in the pre&s;ence of Seth Fo&s;ter, J. Nivi&s;on, Otway Byrd, Dr. Barraud, the Briti&s;h Con&s;ul and &s;everal others; for on being a&s;ked by capt. Traxton on Sun|day la&s;t, what had become of the man he had &s;ent as one of the mutineers on board of the Hermione frigate, he replied that he had delivered him to the Briti&s;h con&s;ul. Mr Hamil|ton, who was pre&s;ent, ob&s;erved, HE had &s;ent him to Jamai|ca, where he was hanged. Although this confe&s;&s;ion was made in the pre&s;ence of &s;taunch federali&s;ts and men of order, yet the principle was alarming, and of cour&s;e made &s;ome

noi&s;e. As &s;oon as I heard of it I applied to the jailor. The re&s;ult of my enquiry is, that there was &s;uch a per&s;on commit|ted by Doctor Read, &s;ubject to the order of the Briti&s;h Con|&s;ul; that he was taken out of jail, and put on board of a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el&mdash;but what his fate was, he knows not.&mdash;The mittimus he &s;ays is either lo&s;t or mi&s;laid. The jailor al&s;o in|formed me, that previous to this another man was commit|ted by Doctor Read for the &s;ame offence, but that he died in jail before there was an opportunity to &s;end him away; a copy of this mittimus I herewith &s;end you.</P>
<P>I &s;hall forbear to remark on the dreadful con&s;equences that may ari&s;e from a conduct of this &s;ort, and &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that if men cloathed with authority can be made in&s;tru|ments of oppre&s;&s;ion to gratify the views of a Briti&s;h Con&s;ul, we may bid adieu to the liberty and happine&s;s of our coun|try, and every thing dear and valuable to us in it. From con|viction in my mind, that doctor Read's conduct has been im|proper, I have thought it incumbent on me to give you this information. I am very re&s;pectfully, your's &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>Mr. DAVIS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;ubjoined letter was written by me to Governor Monroe, and went to the hope, that his Excellency, &s;en&s;ible of the injury he mu&s;t have done me, in his letter of com|munication to the legi&s;lature, would have thought it right, to reque&s;t a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the public opinion, until the event of that pro&s;ecution which he has ordered again&s;t me, and which is <HI>depending</HI> and <HI>undetermined,</HI> &s;hould be known. But, his Excellency has neither deigned to notice my letter, or to take any mea&s;ures for &s;oftening the &s;everity of his denun|ciation.</P>
<P>Is it not novelty in the <HI>new</HI> philo&s;ophy? Is it not a phenome|non in the Executive Department of any free country, to appoint an <HI>Inquisitor,</HI> for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of inviting, &s;oliciting, and <HI>culling</HI> &s;uch te&s;timony <HI>exparte,</HI> as &s;hall &s;uit the dark purpo&s;es of a malicious informer? Is it not new, that the unguarded openne&s;s of private conver&s;ation, in dome&s;|tic circles (like the domiciliary vi&s;its of Robe&s;pierre) &s;hall be betrayed, and tortured into matter of information and impeachment? and that from &s;uch evidence, and the hypo|thetical opinion of an Attorney General founded thereon, a Chief Magi&s;trate, &s;hall think him&s;elf authori&s;ed to <HI>prejudge</HI> a ca&s;e&mdash;denounce an individual, and con&s;ign him to the re|&s;entment and execution of his fellow citizens&mdash;untried, un|heard?</P>
<P>Con&s;cious that I have never have been governed by im|proper motives, in any act of my official duty. I feel little apprehen&s;ion for the con&s;equences of this pro&s;ecution&mdash;the
<PB N="157" REF="035113_0171_1000BF4C30D217B8">
errors of judment may be imputed to me (for 'tis the portion of human nature to err,) but the <HI>honours</HI> which &s;urrounded his Excellency, with a much better &s;alary &s;uperadded, would be con&s;iderations in&s;ufficient to induce me to commit an act, which the dictates of my own heart did not fully ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>For the&s;e, and many other rea&s;ons, I think it nece&s;&s;ary, through the medium of your paper, to reque&s;t a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the public opinion, until the event of the pro&s;ecution now depending, &s;hall be known.</P>
<P>As to the illiberal, unju&s;tifiable, unexampled and violent lan|guage, which has been u&s;ed by many members of A&s;&s;embly, both within and without the hou&s;e, proceeding from the im|pre&s;&s;ions which were made by the communications, I &s;hall forbear to make any other remark, than to leave the per&s;ons who are implicated, to the unavoidable accu&s;ations of their own con&s;ciences, or to be more and more expo&s;ed by their own ob&s;tinate &s;tupidity.</P>

<P>SIR,&mdash;I &s;hall be pardoned for a&s;&s;erting an inherent right of complaining when an injury is done me, however eleva|ted the &s;tation of him, by whom &s;uch injury is meditated.</P>
<P>I complain, Sir, of an unju&s;tifiable and wanton exerci&s;e of your powers, as Chief Magi&s;trate of this Commonwealth, in the expo&s;ition of documents, taken <HI>exparte,</HI> and which you knew were not te&s;timony, even in that Court, from who&s;e archives you have taken them, and in which the pro|&s;ecution, by your order in&s;tituted again&s;t me, is depending and undetermined, to the Legi&s;lature of Virginia, in your letter of communication to that honorable body. I &s;ay <HI>unjustifiable,</HI> becau&s;e, I am at this moment a &s;ubject of legal pro&s;ecution before another tribunal, and the law which made you a Go|vernor, forbade your <HI>prejudging</HI> a cau&s;e, or fixing a guilt of offence, on a man thus circum&s;tanced, ere that guilt had been proved by a legal and impartial trial!</P>
<P>The procedure complained of, was wanton, becau&s;e, as no legi&s;lative interference could po&s;&s;ibly affect me, for a &s;uppo&s;ed offence heretofore committed, and as you have honoured me with executive, I can by no means become the object of le|gi&s;lative attention; therefore, no valuable purpo&s;e, could re&s;ult, from con&s;igning me, to the execration and re&s;entment of my fellow-citizens at large, by a communication thus highly &s;anctioned, unle&s;s indeed, it was calculated to poi&s;on and influence the public mind, to the dereliction of that im|partiality, which &s;hould be the fir&s;t feature in the event of every legal proce&s;s.</P>
<P>I forbear entering fully into this novel and extraordinary precedure, left under the pre&s;&s;ure of the injury you have done me, I &s;hould be tempted to lo&s;e &s;ight of that re&s;pect, which I

<P>In the Hou&s;e of Delegates, Jan. 14, Mr. Edm. Harri&s;on reported from the committee appointed to inve&s;tigate and re|port upon the conduct of John Hamilton, the con&s;ul re&s;ident at Norfolk, in the tran&s;action alluded to in the Governor's communication relative to the alledged delivery of Hugh Jones, by John K. Read, and at the reque&s;t of the &s;aid con|&s;ul, that the committee had, according to order, had the &s;aid &s;ubject under their con&s;ideration, and are of opinion, that John Hamilton, as con&s;ul, was not authori&s;ed under the laws of the United States, or any exi&s;ting treaties, between his Britannic Maje&s;ty and the United States to demand the &s;ur|render of any per&s;on what&s;oever, as he is repre&s;ented to have done.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o of opinion, that the delivery of the &s;aid Hugh Jones, if made as repre&s;ented, was done without any authority under the exi&s;ting laws of this &s;tate or of the Uni|ted States, and that &s;uch delivery if &s;o unlawfully made, does in no degree extenuate or dimini&s;h the offence of the &s;aid John Hamilton.</P>
<P>And Whereas it is provided by the Con&s;titution of the U|nited States, that the judicial power of the United States &s;hall extend to all ca&s;es affecting Amba&s;&s;adors, or other public Mini&s;ters or Con&s;uls.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That the Governor be reque&s;ted to tran&s;mit to the Pre&s;ident of the United States, a copy of the beforemen|tioned communication, together with the documents accompa|nying the &s;ame, with a reque&s;t that he will cau&s;e the tran&s;ac|tion to be enquired into by the competent authority; and that &s;uch redre&s;s may be given, as the laws of nations and the United States will warrant.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That provi&s;ion ought to be made by law, for puni&s;hing any like offences that may happen in future.</P>
<P>Then the fir&s;t Re&s;olution being twice read, was on the que&s;|tion being put thereupon, agreed to by hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Re&s;olution being twice read, a motion was made to amend the &s;ame by &s;triking out the words "happen in future" at the end thereof, and in&s;erting the words "in future be committed by any per&s;on &s;ubject to the juri&s;diction of this State."</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="035113_0173_1000BF505B4C4BE8">
And the que&s;tion being put, it pa&s;&s;ed in the affirmative.</P>
<P>And the que&s;tion being put on the Re&s;olution as amended, it pa&s;&s;ed in the affirmative.</P>
<P>Ordered, That a Bill be brought in pur&s;uant to the &s;econd Re&s;olution, and that the Committee who reported it do pre|pare and bring in a bill accordingly.</P>
<P>In the Hou&s;e of Delegates, Dec. 31, Mr. Edm. Harri&s;on reported from the Committee to whom was referred the Go|vernor's letter on the &s;ubject of the late con&s;piracy of &s;laves, and a petition of &s;undry citizens of this Commonwealth, complaining of various grievances ari&s;ing from the law for freeing negroes, and praying a repeal thereof, that the committee had according to order, had the &s;ame under their con&s;ideration, and had agreed upon the following re&s;olu|tions:</P>
<P N="1">1. Re&s;olved, as the opinion of this committee, that the Executive be reque&s;ted to di&s;tribute arms to the citizens of Norfolk, Port&s;mouth, Peter&s;burg, Manche&s;ter, Richmond, Frederick&s;burg and Alexandria, under &s;uch regulations and re&s;traints as will in&s;ure the &s;afe keeping of &s;aid arms</P>
<P N="2">2 Re&s;olved, as the opinion of this committee, that a law ought to pa&s;s, authori&s;ing magi&s;trates to call out patroles, and &s;ubjecting the military in certain ca&s;es to the orders of the civil authority.</P>
<P N="3">3.

<P>Re&s;olved, That it is the opinion of this Committee, that the pre&s;ervation of the ancient records of this country, is an object which highly merits the attention of the Legi&s;lature, &s;ince on them the rights of property, the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, and the means of hi&s;torical information e&s;&s;entially depend.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="035113_0186_1000BF6587D124F8">
Re&s;olved therefore, That an edition of all the laws pa&s;&s;ed by the Legi&s;lature of this country, prior to the year 1782, which can now be found, be printed at the public expence&mdash;that the Governor and George Wythe, E&s;q. be reque&s;ted to &s;uperintend the collection and printing thereof; and that they be authori&s;ed to employ a proper per&s;on or per&s;ons to aid in the completion of the work.</P>
<P>And the &s;aid re&s;olutions being twice read, were, on the que&s;tion put thereupon, agreed to by the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Ordered, That a bill be brought in pur&s;uant to the &s;aid Re|&s;olutions, and that the Committee for Courts of Ju&s;tice do prepare and bring in the &s;ame.</P>
<P>A Bill has pa&s;&s;ed the Legi&s;lature of Virginia, to incorpo|rate a Company, for e&s;tabli&s;hing a turnpike road from the mouth of Savage river or George's creek on the Potomack, to the neare&s;t we&s;tern navigation. It is propo&s;ed that this turnpike &s;hould commence at the mouth of Savage river, which is 21 miles above Fort Cumberland, and about 200 from Georgetown. A &s;ub&s;cription is to be opened for 50,000 dollars, in &s;hares of 50 dollars each. The important benefits to be derived from carrying this plan into effect, will more fully appear from the following preamble to the bill:</P>
<P>Whereas it is conceived that great advantages would ac|crue to the trade of Potomack and to this Commonwealth generally, by making ea&s;y the communication between the head navigation of that river and the neare&s;t we&s;tern naviga|tion, which would cau&s;e the produce of a large extent of the we&s;tern country to take its cour&s;e into this channel, in&s;tead of going 2,500 miles partly through the dominion of a fo|reign nation to a market at New-Orleans. And whereas it is repre&s;ented to this General A&s;&s;embly, that the&s;e navigations may be made to communicate by a road of about 40 miles, and that an a&s;&s;ociation of citizens will be willing to under|take to make the road if proper legi&s;lative encouragement be given by the &s;tates of Virginia and Maryland, through both of which the road will have to pa&s;s about an equal di&s;tance, &amp;c."</P>
<P>A work has been publi&s;hed at Berlin, profe&s;&s;ing to give <HI>&s;e|cret</HI> anecdotes relative to Ru&s;&s;ia:&mdash;Among other things it is &s;aid, that "Madame Lebrun, no le&s;s celebrated for her af|fairs of gallantry with Vandreuil and Calonne than for her talents, intended to draw a Portrait of Catherine II. after her death.

<P>In England a mode has been di&s;covered of manufacturing paper from <HI>&s;traw</HI> It is of &s;trong con&s;i&s;tence, and though it retains the colour of the material from which it is made, will &s;erve for packing parcels, printing hand-bills, and &s;uch other ordinary purpo&s;es. It is hoped thorefore, that this in|vention will reduce the pre&s;ent advanced price of rags and paper, and de&s;troy a monopoly.</P>

"Thus we &s;ee (&s;ays the Duke) that a barrel of flour, who&s;e medium value in 1791 was 5 dollars 55 cents&mdash;in 1792, 5 drs. 3 cts.&mdash;in 1793, 5 drs. 15 cts.&mdash;in 1794, 5 drs. 56 cts. ro&s;e, in 1795, to 9 drs. 35 cts.&mdash;and that Indian Corn, an article but of &s;econdary demand, was at 37 cents the bu&s;hel in 1791, at 54 in 1792, at 61 in 1793, at 51 in 1794, and at 66 in 1795.</P>
<P>"The exportations from Norfolk amounted, in the year 1791, to 1,028,789 dollars&mdash;in 1792, to 1,147,414&mdash;in 1793, to 1,045,525&mdash;in 1794, to 1,687,194&mdash;in 1795, to 1,934,827&mdash;and already to 1,088,105 dollars for the fir&s;t quarter of 1796&mdash;When we con&s;ider the increa&s;e of the exports for &s;ome years back, we mu&s;t recollect that the difference is much more con&s;iderable in the value than in the quantity. The nece&s;&s;ities of Europe have more than doubled the price; and altho' it be certainly a fact that the clearing of new grounds augments the quantity of produce, that augmentation bears no proporation to the difference of value pre&s;ented by the tables for three years back &s;ent in from the different Cu&s;tom|hou&s;es."</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="description of city">
<P>The Duke, after giving a curious account of his unplea|&s;ant voyage from Charle&s;town in a &s;mall, encumber'd ve&s;&s;el, proceeds to de&s;cribe Norfolk, &amp;c.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Norfolk is built on Elizabeth-River, at nine miles from the &s;pot where it di&s;charges its waters into the bay. In the intervening &s;pace there are few hou&s;es, and tho&s;e few almo&s;t all pre&s;ent a wretched appearance. An almo&s;t uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pines are the only object which meets the voy|agers eye. Craney I&s;land lies nearly in the middle of the river at a &s;hort di&s;tance above its mouth. Two points of land, which approach within a quarter of a mile of each o|ther in front of Norfolk, are &s;trengthened with forts which are capable of &s;ucce&s;sfully defending the entrance. That on the Norfolk &s;ide is in better condition than the other, which, however, might be &s;peedily repaired, at no great expence.</P>
<P>"Port&s;mouth, a &s;mall a&s;&s;emblage of hou&s;es on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, did not &s;hare in the conflagration of Nor|folk. From its &s;ituation it &s;eemed entitled to expect all the commerce of Elizabeth-River: at its quays the greate&s;t depth of water is found: at the highe&s;t tides, it is there 12 feet deep, whereas it is only 6 at Norfolk; the pump-water at the former place is not bracki&s;h, as at the latter; the &s;oil on which the town is built is more dry, and the air more &s;alubrious. But, at the conclu&s;ion of the peace, the inhab|itants incen&s;ed again&s;t the Engli&s;h, refu&s;ed to admit any merchant of that nation, or any new-comer who&s;e political principles were liable to &s;u&s;picion. To this rancorous di&s;po|&s;ition was attributed a political motive of a le&s;s generous kind&mdash;an apprehen&s;ion on the part of the American mer|chants
<PB N="183" REF="035113_0197_1000BF79620A10C8">
who had remained at Port&s;mouth, left the new traders who came to &s;ettle among them, &s;hould, by the advantage of bringing in greater capitals than they them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, be enabled to outdo them in the line of commerce.</P>
<P>"However this may be, the con&s;equences has been, that the inhabitants have removed to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide; that Norfolk has been rebuilt, and that its trade is twenty times more con&s;iderable than that of Port&s;mouth; nay, the few merchants who &s;till re&s;ide in the latter town, purcha&s;e at Norfolk almo&s;t all the articles that con&s;titute their cargoes, and &s;ome of them even have their compting-hou&s;es there.</P>
<P>"At the clo&s;e of the year 1783, there were not 12 hou&s;es rebuilt in Norfolk; at pre&s;ent (1796) there are between 7 and 800. It is one of the uglie&s;t, mo&s;t irregular, and mo&s;t filthy towns that can any where be found. The hou&s;es are low and un&s;ightly, almo&s;t all con&s;tructed of wood, and erected without any attention to regularity; not 20 of them are built with brick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">. The &s;treets are unpaved; the town is &s;urroun|ded by &s;wamps; the ha&s;tine&s;s and &s;tench which prevail are exce&s;&s;ive, and add to the natural in&s;alubrity of the &s;ituation, and of the climate, which is extremely hot.</P>
<P>"From the&s;e concurrent &s;ources of unhealthine&s;s, it re|&s;ults, that di&s;ea&s;es are habitual at Norfolk in &s;ummer and autumn, and that malignant epidemics are frequent. La&s;t year the Yellow Fever is &s;aid to have carried off 500 per&s;ons from a population of 4000; 300 died at the time the di&s;|temper prevailed, the others fell victims to its con&s;equences.&mdash;The inhabitants of Norfolk, even tho&s;e among them who are the mo&s;t opulent, fancy that the u&s;e of wine and &s;trong liquors furni&s;hes them with a pre&s;ervative again&s;t the in&s;a|lubrity of the climate, and they make a liberal u&s;e of the remedy.&mdash;Previous to the war, Norfolk is &s;aid to have con|tained 8000 inhabitants.</P>
<P>"Norfolk carries on a con&s;iderable trade with Europe, the Antilles, and the northern States. Her exports are flour, wheat, Indian corn, timber of every kind, particularly planks, &s;taves, and &s;hingles, &s;alt meat and fi&s;h, iron, lead, flax-&s;eed, tobacco, tar, turpentine, and hemp. All the&s;e ar|ticles are the produce of Virginia, or of North Carolina, which latter State, having no &s;ea-ports, or none that are good, makes her exportations chiefly thro' tho&s;e of Virginia.</P>
<P>"Norfolk is the only port for the &s;outhern part of this exten&s;ive State; for, as no ve&s;&s;els above 120 tons can go up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o Peter&s;burg or Richmond<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here the noble Duke has been mi&s;informed&mdash;Any ve&s;|&s;el drawing le&s;s than 17 feet water may come up James River to City Point, the delivering-place for Peter&s;burg; and there is 12 feet water at Rockets, the landing-place for Richmond.</NOTE>, the produce of the back country, which is brought to tho&s;e places by land, is for the mo&s;t part
<PB N="184" REF="035113_0198_1000BF7BE3856A10">
&s;ent down in lighters to Norfolk, from whence it is ex|ported. Thus, this port almo&s;t &s;ingly carries on all the commerce of that part of Virginia which lies &s;outh of the Rappahannock, and of North Carolina far beyond the Roanoke.</P>
<P>"Ten years ago, Norfolk could not reckon ten large ve&s;|&s;els of her own; whereas at pre&s;ent &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es fifty of that de&s;cription, exclu&s;ive of fifty others of &s;maller &s;ize employ|ed in the We&s;t India trade. Under the name Norfolk, are to be under&s;tood Norfolk and Port&s;mouth, as they con&s;titute but one port of entry, and are both &s;ubject to the &s;ame Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e.&mdash;The pre&s;ent tonnage of Norfolk is 15,567 tons, exclu&s;ive of the ve&s;&s;els employed in the coa&s;ting trade.</P>
<P>"The exportation of Tobacco from Norfolk has, by the diminution of the culture of that article in Virginia, been reduced above one third within the la&s;t five years. In 1793, it amounted to 15,000 hhds.&mdash;in 1794, to 11,054&mdash;and, in 1795, to 9,968 hhds. I have not been able to procure an accurate &s;tatement of the quantities in 1791 and 92."&mdash;</P>
<P>(At pre&s;ent we mu&s;t conclude our extracts from this work.&mdash;It is not written in that lively, vivacious &s;tyle which gene|rally di&s;tingui&s;h French authors, but this may be owing to the Tran&s;lator; and, as may expected, the Duke &s;ometimes writes with the partiality of a Frenchman, particularly when he &s;peaks of England or Engli&s;h men.&mdash;Upon the whole, however, we recommend this Book to the peru&s;al of all Americans, and among them the good people of Virginia; it contains many articles worthy of their mo&s;t &s;erious atten|tion.&mdash;Do we wi&s;h to <HI>know ourselves,</HI> will we con&s;ult only tho&s;e who are partial to us?&mdash;If we de&s;ire to have a right knowledge of our own characters, and to know what really are our faults and imperfections, let us con&s;ult &s;trangers and tho&s;e who are not partial to us&mdash;it is &s;ometimes even nece&s;|&s;ary to li&s;ten to the remarks of our enemies.&mdash;We do not mean to intimate, that the Due de Liancourt is an enemy to America; on the contrary, he &s;peaks with e&s;teem and grati|tude of the ho&s;pitable reception which he received in almo&s;t every part of the Union.)</P>

On the &s;ubject of <HI>improvements,</HI> we have only to add, that there is nothing about the town of Peter&s;burg that &s;o much requires to be improved, <HI>i. e.</HI> new built, as Pocohunta bridge.&mdash;Of all the bad bridges in the country, this &s;eems to be the wor&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;Leading into a place of con&s;iderable commercial con|&s;equence, and placed on the great &s;outhern road, its pre&s;ent condition is both &s;candalous and dangerous.&mdash;If the Prince&s;s could rai&s;e her head, her Highne&s;s would be a&s;hamed of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of her property, for the very little re&s;pect paid to her memory, and the very little regard held for the public convenience and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, we do not know upon what grounds, that the owners of property in and about Peter&s;burg, by a churli&s;h, impolitic di&s;po&s;ition, are very far from being encouragers of improvement&mdash;We can &s;carcely believe this report&mdash;Be|&s;ides the with of &s;eeing a re&s;pectable and flouri&s;hing com|munity ri&s;ing around them, the idea of being con&s;idered the promoters of public pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, and the &s;u|preme plea&s;ure of being e&s;teemed and beloved by all their fel|low citizens&mdash;they mu&s;t know, that every improvement made by others, augments the value of <HI>their</HI> property, and that they them&s;elves, ultimately, will be the greate&s;t gainers.</P>
<P>There is one other ob&s;ervation which we think it not un|fit to make&mdash;Altho' the inhabitants of Peter&s;burg are made up from various nations, Americans, Engli&s;h, Scotch, Iri&s;h, French, &amp;c. and entertain very different opinions, yet there is le&s;s political a&s;perity di&s;played among them, than perhaps in any town on the continent; "peace and good neighbour|hood" &s;eems to be their favourite maxim. Without attempt|ing to &s;earch for the cau&s;es of this plea&s;ing effect, we, at once, a&s;cribe it to the good &s;en&s;e of this people.&mdash;Long may this amiable &s;uavity continue to be the di&s;tingui&s;hing cha|racteri&s;tic of the town of Peter&s;burg&mdash;God knows we have enough of the real troubles of life, without creating artificial ones&mdash;let us not embitter the ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, by unnece&s;|&s;ary di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, nor di&s;turb the public harmony with fooli&s;h quarrels about "the colour of beards, or the length of no&s;es."</P>

In the walks of the garden where the writer of this article &s;aw it, it could be lifted up in tea-&s;poonfuls. On this &s;ubject, we refer to a paragraph in the New York paper, de&s;cribing the &s;ame phenomenon, and which &s;hews that the de&s;cent of this powder mu&s;t have been very exten&s;ive indeed.</P>
<P>NEW YORK, April 17, 1800. On Saturday evening, be|tween 10 and 12, a &s;evere &s;torm of rain was experienced in this city, accompanied with very vivid fla&s;hes of lightening and &s;ome thunder. The wind was &s;outherly, and the at|mo&s;phere was remarked to be very thick and &s;ultry, yielding a &s;ulphurous &s;mell. Ye&s;terday morning, after the &s;torm had abated, an impalpable powder was perceived in the &s;treets, e&s;|pecially in tho&s;e parts where the water had &s;ub&s;ided, and in the rain-water ca&s;ks, re&s;embling brim&s;tone. Some ingenious gentlemen have made a collection of this &s;ub&s;tance, for the purpo&s;e of experiment; by one of tho&s;e gentlemen we are a&s;&s;ured, that he melted a &s;mall quantity of it, and found it an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of common brim&s;tone in the making of matches. This circum&s;tances is, perhaps, unprecedented; and we mention it with a hope, that wherever it may have occurred, it will attract the notice of philo&s;ophy, as a &s;ub|ject in every re&s;pect de&s;erving a minute inve&s;tigation.</P></NOTE></CELL>

<P N="1">1. It moderates the heat of the &s;ummer &s;un in meadows, and protects and encrea&s;es the quantity of hay and pa&s;ture.</P>
<P N="2">2. The body of the tree, when full grown, after its bark is taken off and it is thoroughly dried, makes good rails.</P>

<P>A divi&s;ion of the di&s;tinct que&s;tions contained in the form of ratification was called for, when the following que&s;tions were taken:&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Shall the 2nd article of the treaty be excepted?&mdash;Two thirds of the members not concurring, the que&s;tion was lo&s;t, and of con&s;equence the 2d article was not excepted.</P>
<P N="2">2. Shall the 3d article of the treaty be excepted?&mdash;Two thirds of the members not concurring the que&s;tion was lo&s;t, and of con&s;equence the 3d article was not excepted.</P>
<P N="3">3. Shall the article declaring that this Treaty &s;hall not af|fect any pre-exi&s;ting Treaties be agreed to?&mdash;Two thirds of the members not concurring, the que&s;tion was lo&s;t, and of con&s;equence the new article was not agreed to.</P>
<P N="4">4. Shall the article, limiting the Treaty to eight years be agreed to?&mdash;This que&s;tion was agreed to by nearly an unani|mous vote.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t three members of the form of Ratification being virtually di&s;agreed to, the Ratification remained uncondition|al, except as to the limitation of the Treaty to eight years.</P>

After which, Mr. Bayard made the following motion, and ordered to lie on the table:&mdash;</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That a Committee be appointed to prepare and bring in a bill <HI>to amend the Common Law,</HI> &s;o as to define and limit the puni&s;hment upon pro&s;ecutions for libels, and to ena|ble a defendant, upon &s;uch pro&s;ecution, to give the truth of the matter charged as a libel, in evidence, in his defence.</P>
<P>Thus, a Law has at length been got rid of, which never ought to have been enacted, if, as its advocates alledge, the Common Law was fully competent to the evil complained of.&mdash;As to Mr. Bayard's explanation, it has the appearance of fairne&s;s, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to enable the Defendant to plead the truth of the alledged libel.&mdash;Mr. Cooper &s;ays, he was <HI>not</HI> permitted to prove the truth of <HI>his</HI> a&s;&s;ertions, as Judge Cha&s;e would not allow him to &s;ummon, Mr Adams as a witne&s;s.</P>

<P>A very important State Paper has ju&s;t made its appear|ance, &s;igned by the Secretary of the Navy Department, which are the fir&s;t fruits of our accommodation with France, and gives a pro&s;pect of a reduction of our war expences in the naval line.&mdash;Mr. Stoddart propo&s;es to fell all the ve&s;&s;els of war now belonging to the United States, except the fol|lowing 13 frigates, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the U.

<P>He then recommends the building a number of 74 gun men of war, and the erection of dock-yards at the following places, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> at Port&s;mouth, New Hamp&s;hire, Bo&s;ton, Phila|delphia, Wa&s;hington, and Norfolk&mdash;"and mea&s;ures have been taken to procure ground at New York for capacious dock-yards, &amp;c. contracts have been made for cannon, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"When the United States (&s;ays Mr. Stoddart) &s;hall own a number of 74 gun &s;hips, and a &s;ufficient number of &s;trong frigates, and that it is known they have the means of en|crea&s;ing, with facility, their naval force, it is hoped we may then avoid tho&s;e wars in which we have no intere&s;t, and not &s;uffer our&s;elves to be plundered or in&s;ulted. An annual &s;um of only 117,387 dollars, would, in a few years, rai&s;e us to this de&s;irable &s;tate of &s;ecurity."</P>
<P>We are &s;orry we have not room for this letter, as it con|tains much information. We recommend it to the peru&s;al of the public, as in it will be &s;een the dawnings of a Naval force, which is one day to lift the States of America up to a dangerous and expen&s;ive, yet, perhaps, unavoidable rival|&s;hip with the great Naval powers of Europe.</P>
