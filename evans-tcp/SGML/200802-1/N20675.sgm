<LG>
<L>OUR Author, who accu&s;es great and &s;mall,</L>
<L>And &s;ays &s;o boldly, there are faults in all;</L>
<L>Sends me with di&s;mal voice, and lengthen'd phiz,</L>
<L>Humbly to own one dreadful fault of his:</L>
<L>A fault, in modern Authors not uncommon,</L>
<L>It is,&mdash;now don't angry&mdash;He's&mdash;<HI>a woman.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can you forgive it? Nay, I'll tell you more,</L>
<L>One who has dar'd to venture here before;</L>
<L>Has &s;een your &s;miles, your frowns,&mdash;tremendous &s;ight!</L>
<L>O, be not in a frowning mood to night!</L>
<L>The Play, perhaps, has many things ami&s;s:</L>
<L>Well, let us then reduce the point to this,</L>
<L>Let only tho&s;e that have no failings, hi&s;s.</L>

<L><HI>The Rights of Women,</HI> &s;ays a female pen,</L>
<L>Are, to do every thing as well as Men.</L>
<L>To think, to argue, to decide, to write,</L>
<L>To talk, undoubtedly&mdash;perhaps, to fight.</L>
<L>[For Females march to war, like brave Commanders,</L>
<L>Not in old Authors only&mdash;but in Flanders.]</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I grant this matter may be &s;train'd too far,</L>
<L>And Maid 'gain&s;t Man is mo&s;t uncivil war:</L>
<L>I grant, as all my City friends will &s;ay,</L>
<L>That Men &s;hould rule, and Women &s;hould obey:</L>
<L>That nothing binds the marriage contract fa&s;ter,</L>
<L>Than our&mdash;a "Zounds, Madam, I'm your lord and ma&s;ter."</L>
<L>I grant their nature, and their frailty &s;uch,</L>
<L>Women may make too free&mdash;and know too much.</L>
<L>But &s;ince the Sex at length has been inclin'd</L>
<L>To cultivate that u&s;eful part&mdash;the mind;&mdash;</L>
<L>Since they have learnt to read, to write, to &s;pell;&mdash;</L>
<L>Since &s;ome of them have wit,&mdash;and u&s;e it well;&mdash;</L>
<L>Let us not force them back with brow &s;evere,</L>
<L>Within the pale of ignorance and fear.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PLACID.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU are to blame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ay the &s;ame by you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet your &s;ingularity plea&s;es me; for you the fir&s;t elderly bachelor I ever knew, who did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him&s;elf in the reflexion, that he was not in the tram|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s of wedlock.&mdash;And you really wi&s;h you were married?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do. I wi&s;h &s;till more, that I had been married thirty years ago. Oh! I wi&s;h a wife and half a &s;core children would now &s;tart up around me, and bring along with them all that affection, which we &s;hould have had for each other by being earlier acquainted. But as it is, in my pre&s;ent &s;tate, there is not a per&s;on in the world I care a &s;traw for; and the world is pretty even with me, for I don't believe there is a creature in it who cares a &s;traw for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>P&s;haw! you have in your time been a man of gallantry; and, con&s;equently, mu&s;t have made many at|tachments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, &s;uch as men of gallantry u&s;ually make. I
<PB N="6" REF="027154_0005_0fd58f58d4734290">have been attached to women who have purloined my for|tune, and to men who have partaken of the theft: I have been in as much fear of my mi&s;tre&s;s as you are of your wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that po&s;&s;ible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and without having one of tho&s;e tender, delicate ties of a hu&s;band, an excu&s;e for my apprehen&s;ion. &mdash;I have maintained children &mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why do you complain for the want of a family?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not &s;ay I ever had any children; I &s;aid I had <HI>maintained</HI> them; but I never believed they were mine; for I could have no dependance upon the principles of their mother&mdash;and never did I take one of tho&s;e tender infants in my arms, that the forehead of my Valet, the &s;quint eye of my Apothecary, or the double chin of my Chaplain, did not &s;tare me in the face, and damp all the fine feelings of the parent, which I had ju&s;t called up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But tho&s;e are accidents which may occur in the marriage &s;tate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that ca&s;e, a man is pitied&mdash;in mine, he is only laughed at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h to heaven I could exchange the pity which my friends be&s;tow on me, for the merriment which your ill fate excites.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>You want but courage to be envied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does any one doubt my courage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. If a Prince were to offend you, you would challenge him, I have no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if my wife offend me, I am obliged to make an apology&mdash;Was not that her voice? I hope &s;he has not overheard our conver&s;ation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>If &s;he have, &s;he'll be in an ill humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>That &s;he will be, whether &s;he have heard it or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, good day. I don't like to be driven from my plan, my fixed plan of wedlock; and, therefore, I won't be a &s;pectator of your mutual di&s;content.</P>
<STAGE>[Going.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But before you go, Mr. Solus, permit me to remind you of a certain concern, that, I think, would afford you much more delight, than all you can, at this
<PB N="7" REF="027154_0006_0fd58f5da7bf3390">time of life, propo&s;e to your&s;elf in marriage. Make happy by your beneficence, a near relation whom the true&s;t affec|tion has drawn into that &s;tate, but who is denied the ble&s;|&s;ing of competency to make the &s;tate &s;upportable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Solus.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean my nephew, Irwin? But do not you acknowledge he has a wife and children? Did not he marry the woman he loved, and has he not, at this mo|ment, a large family, by whom he is beloved? And is he not, therefore, with all his poverty, much happier than I? He has often told me, when I have reproached him with his indi&s;creet marriage, "that in his wife he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed kingdoms!" Do you &s;uppo&s;e I will give any part of my fortune to a man who enjoys &s;uch exten&s;ive domains? No: &mdash;let him pre&s;erve his territories, and I will keep my lit|tle e&s;tate for my own u&s;e.</P>

<P>What is the matter, Mr. Placid? What is all this noi&s;e about? You know I hate a noi&s;e. What is the matter?</P>

<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, I was only finding fault with that blockhead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mr. Placid, do not find fault with any body in this hou&s;e. But I have &s;omething which I mu&s;t take <HI>you</HI> very &s;everely to ta&s;k about, Sir.</P>

<P>Well, my dear, and &s;uppo&s;e I am?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, I don't approve of people lending their money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But, my dear, I have known you approve of borrowing money: And, once in our lives, what &s;hould we have done, if every body had refu&s;ed to lend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is nothing to the purpo&s;e.&mdash;And now I de&s;ire you will hear what I &s;ay, without &s;peaking a word your&s;elf.</P>

<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now mind you don't &s;peak, till I have done.&mdash; Our old acquaintance, Captain Irwin, &mdash;Lady Eleanor, his wife (with whom we lived upon very inti|mate terms, to be &s;ure, while we were in America), are returned to England; and I find you have vi&s;ited them very frequently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not above two or three times, upon my word; for it hurts me to &s;ee them in di&s;tre&s;s, and I forbear to go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>There! You own they are in di&s;tre&s;s; I expected as much. Now, own to me that they a&s;ked you to lend them money.</P>

<P>I do own it&mdash;I do own it. Now are you &s;a|tisfied?</P>

<PB N="10" REF="027154_0009_0fd58f61a1a042d8">philanthropy becomes in&s;upportable; and, in&s;tead of be|ing a virtue, degenerates into a vice.</P>

<P>Dear Madam, do not upbraid me for a con|&s;titutional fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Spin&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; you had it from your infancy. I have heard your mother &s;ay you were always fooli&s;hly tender-hearted, and never &s;howed one of tho&s;e di&s;crimi|nating pa&s;&s;ions of envy, hatred, or revenge, to which all her other children were liable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: &s;ince I can remember, I have felt the mo&s;t unbounded affection for all my fellow creatures. I even prote&s;t to you, dear Madam, that, as I walk along &s;treets of this large metropolis, &s;o warm is my heart to|wards every per&s;on who pa&s;&s;es me, that I long to &s;ay, "How do you do?" and "I am glad to &s;ee you," to them all.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harmony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, 'tis truth: and I &s;incerely lament that human beings &s;hould be &s;uch &s;trangers to one another as we are. We live in the &s;ame &s;treet, without knowing one another's nece&s;&s;ities; and oftentimes meet and part from each other at church, at coffee-hou&s;es, play hou&s;es, and all public places, without ever &s;peaking a &s;ingle word, or nodding "Good bye!" though tis a hundred chances to ten we never &s;ee one another again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s Spin&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me tell you, kin&s;man, all this pre|tended philanthropy renders you ridiculous.&mdash;There is not a fraud, a theft, or hardly any vice committed, that you do not take the criminal's part, &s;hake your head, and cry, "Provi&s;ions are &s;o &s;carce!" And no longer ago than la&s;t Lord-mayor's day, when you were told that Mr. Alder|man Ravenous was ill with an indige&s;tion, you endeavoured to &s;often the matter, by exclaiming, "Provi&s;ions are &s;o &s;carce!"&mdash;But, above all, I condemn the fal&s;e humanity, which induces you to &s;ay many things in conver&s;ation which de&s;erve to &s;tigmatize you with the character of de|ceit.</P>

<P>This is a weakne&s;s I confe&s;s. But though my honour &s;ometimes reproaches me with it as a fault, my
<PB N="11" REF="027154_0010_0fd58f63019f0618">con&s;cience never does: for it is by this very failing that I have frequently made the bittere&s;t enemies friends&mdash;Ju&s;t by &s;aying a few harmle&s;s &s;entences, which, though a &s;pe|cies of fal&s;ehood and deceit, yet, being &s;oothing and ac|ceptable to the per&s;on offended, I have immediately in&s;pir|ed him with lenity and forgivene&s;s; and then, by only repeating the &s;elf-&s;ame &s;entences to his opponent, I have known hearts cold and clo&s;ed to each other, warmed and expanded, as every human creature's ought to be.</P>

<P>Why, to tell you the truth, your relation, Mi&s;s Spin&s;ter, is no great favourite of mine; and I don't like to dine with you, becau&s;e I don't like her company.</P>

<P>Why, old bachelors and old maids never agree: we are too much alike in our habits: we know our own hearts &s;o well, we are apt to di&s;cover every foible we would wi&s;h to forget, in the &s;ymptoms di&s;played by the other.

<P>Sir, do you wi&s;h to be di|vorced?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no &s;uch pro&s;pect. Mrs. Placid is faith|ful, and I was married in England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if you have an unconquerable de&s;ire to part, a &s;eparate maintenance will an&s;wer nearly the &s;ame end&mdash;for if your lady and you will only lay down the plan of &s;eparation, and agree&mdash;</P>

<P>I thank you; I'm very much obliged to you; I thank you a thou&s;and times.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I have &s;tudied the art of tea&s;ing a wife; and there is nothing vexes her &s;o much as laughing at her. Can you laugh, Mr. Placid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Placid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know whether I can; I have not laughed &s;ince I married &mdash;But I thank you, Sir, for your in&s;tructions&mdash;I &s;incerely thank you.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; but I find &s;ome of my countrymen changed. I fancy them le&s;s warm, le&s;s friendly than they were; and it is that which, perhaps, has this effect upon me.</P>

<P>As to that&mdash;that would be no great object at pre&s;ent. No, thank Heaven, my e&s;tates are pretty large; I have no children; I have a rich Uncle, excellent health, admirable &s;pirits,&mdash;and thus happy, it would be very &s;trange if I did not meet my old friends with tho&s;e &s;miles, which never for a moment quit my countenance.</P>

<P>My dear Sir, never trouble your&s;elf about the time of paying it, becau&s;e it happens not to be in my power to lend it you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in your power? I beg your pardon; but have not you this moment been &s;aying you are rich?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is it not very common to be rich with|out money? Are not half the town rich? And yet half the town has no money. I &s;peak for this end of the town, the We&s;t end. The Squares, for in&s;tance, part of Picca|dilly, down St. James's &s;treet, and &s;o home by Pall Mall. We have all, e&s;tates, bonds, draughts, and notes of hand without number; but as for money, we have no &s;uch thing belonging to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Irwin.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;incerely beg your pardon. And be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, nothing &s;hould have induced me to have taken the liberty I have done, but the nece&s;&s;ities of my unhappy

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <HI>am</HI> in affluence, I am, I am; but not in &s;o much, perhaps, as my ha&s;ty, incon&s;iderate account may have given you rea&s;on to believe. I forgot to mention &s;e|veral heavy incumbrances, which you will perceive are great drawbacks on my fortune.&mdash;As my wife &s;ued for the divorce, I have her fortune to return; I have al&s;o two &s;i&s;ters to portion off&mdash;a circum&s;tance I totally forgot. But, my good friend, though I am not in circum&s;tances to do what you require, I will do &s;omething that &s;hall be better. I'll wait upon your father-in-law, (Lord Norland) and entreat him to forgive his daughter: and I am &s;ure he will if I a&s;k him.</P>

And whenever you &s;hall do me the favour to call upon me, I &s;hall be heartily glad to &s;ee you.

<P>I tell you, Mr. Harmony, that i&s; an indifferent per&s;on, one on whom I had never be&s;towed a &s;avour in my life, were to offend me, it is in my nature never to forgive. Can I then forgive my own daughter, my only child, on whom I heaped continually marks of the mo&s;t affectionate fondne&s;s?

<P>Your child, con&s;ider.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>The weake&s;t argument you can u&s;e. As my child, was not &s;he mo&s;t bound to obey me? As my child ought &s;he not to have &s;acrificed her own happine&s;s to mine?

<P>I would have concealed it from all the world; I wi&s;hed it even unknown to my&s;elf.

<SP>

<P>I believe you;&mdash;and in compa&s;&s;ion to the child, give you my <HI>&s;olemn promi&s;e</HI> never to reveal who he is. I have heard that tho&s;e unfortunate parents left an in|fant behind when they went abroad, and that they lament him as lo&s;t. Will you &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity, in what man|ner you &s;ought and found him out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Norland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you &s;uppo&s;e I &s;earched for him? No;&mdash;he was forced upon me. A woman followed me, about eight years ago, in the fields adjoining to my country &s;eat, with a half &s;tarved boy in her hand, and a&s;ked my charity for my grand child: the impre&s;&s;ion of the word, made me turn round involuntarily; and ca&s;ting my eyes upon him, I was rejoiced, not to find a feature of his mother's in all his face; and I began to feel &s;omething like pity for him. In &s;hort, he caught &s;uch fa&s;t hold by one of my fingers, that I a&s;ked him carele&s;sly "if he would go home and live with me?" On which, he an&s;wered me &s;o willingly "Yes," I took him at his word.</P>

<P>I am not very well at pre&s;ent; I have the head-ache; and, if ever a wife can be of comfort to her hu&s;band, it mu&s;t be when he is indi&s;po&s;ed. A wife, then, binds up your head, mixes your powders, bathes your temples, and hovers about, in a way that is mo&s;t endear|ing.</P>

In one of the&s;e fits of phrenzy, he held an in&s;trument of death, meant for his own de&s;truction, to the brea&s;t of your Lord (who by accident that moment pa&s;&s;ed,) and took from him, what he vainly hoped might pre&s;erve his own life, and relieve the wants of his family. But his paroxy&s;m over, he &s;hrunk from what he had done, and gave the whole he had thus unwarrantably taken, into a &s;ervant's hands to be returned to its lawful owner. The man admitted to this confidence, betrayed his tru&s;t, and in&s;tead of giving up what was &s;o &s;acredly delivered to him, &s;ecreted it; and, to obtain the promi&s;ed reward, came to this hou&s;e, but to inform again&s;t the wretched of|fender; who now, only re&s;ting on your Lord's clemency, can e&s;cape the direful fate he has incurred.</P>

<L>The charm that waits on fond and faithful love;</L>
<L>When &s;uited years, and pliant tempers join;</L>
<L>And the heart glows with energy divine,</L>
<L>As the lov'd offspring of the happy pair</L>
<L>Oft climb the knee, the envied ki&s;s to &s;hare.</L>

<L>Oh! may the noble zeal, the glorious &s;tand</L>
<L>Which once pre&s;erv'd this independant land,</L>
<L>Secure to every brea&s;t, with glad increa&s;e,</L>
<L>The heartfelt ble&s;&s;ings of dome&s;tic peace!</L>
