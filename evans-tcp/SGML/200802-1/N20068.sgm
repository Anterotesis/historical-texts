<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE quick &s;ale of the fir&s;t impre&s;|&s;ion of his Treati&s;e on the Di&s;|ea&s;es of Children, has encouraged the author to take &s;ome pains in correcting and enlarging this &s;econd edition. He has at the &s;ame time endeavoured to avoid all unnece&s;&s;ary details, and u&s;e|le&s;s di&s;tinctions, as well as extending it to &s;ubjects foreign from the immediate de&s;ign. Should the reader apprehend any little exceptions in this re&s;pect, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> readily perceive the inducement; and although the accuracy of &s;y&s;tem &s;hould really be violated, it is pre&s;umed, it has only given way to motives of humanity and u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="026291_0003_0FCFAA3ACC3DF4F8">
Perfectly &s;en&s;ible, however, of nu|merous defects, the writer relies again upon the indulgence of the Public, though he hopes this edition will be found &s;omewhat more compleat, and more worthy of a continuance of that favourable reception wherewith the for|mer was &s;o generally honoured. Parti|cular acknowledgements, indeed, are due for the approbation of the faculty; and the like candor, it is hoped, will now excu&s;e any alterations that have been intended to render this edition more ea&s;y and familiar to common read|ers. For the &s;ake of public utility, the writer has carefully avoided all technical terms, or has &s;o explained them, and &s;o enlarged on the nature of di&s;ea&s;es, and the do&s;es of medicines, that parents, and others not ver&s;ed in the practice of phy&s;ic, may find all com|mon directions &s;ufficiently explicit: whenever they appear otherwi&s;e, read|ers of that de&s;cription &s;hould con|clude, that the ca&s;e is too difficult for their management, and that probably the be&s;t guide might mi&s;lead them.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="026291_0004_0FD0DC26F8650EB8">
The prolixity of other parts may be equally di&s;agreeable to profe&s;&s;ional men.&mdash;For the &s;tyle in general, indeed, the author pretends to have but little to of|fer. Had he more lei&s;ure, po&s;&s;ibly the faults might have been fewer; and per|haps, the nece&s;&s;ity of clearly and intel|ligibly expre&s;&s;ing what is to be &s;aid, may, in this in&s;tance, be pleaded with tho&s;e who expect conci&s;ene&s;s and accu|racy; which every writer &s;hould aim at. It may therefore be ob&s;erved, that &s;ome con&s;entaneous di&s;ea&s;es have been longer dwelt upon, and their remedies oftener hinted, than might be nece&s;&s;ary for many readers. To &s;uch, however, as are them&s;elves obliged to &s;uperintend the health of their children, and to tho&s;e who derive a happine&s;s from contribut|ing to that of their offspring, there will not be much apology nece&s;&s;ary, either for entering &s;o fully into the LITTLE matters that compo&s;e the SECOND part of the work, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for enlarging el&s;ewhere on many circum&s;tances that may appear trifling when &s;eparately con|&s;idered. It was, indeed, very much with a view to their u&s;e and profit, that
<PB N="viii" REF="026291_0005_0FCFAA3963DAF480">
the work was originally undertaken; and to their notice and protection it is again &s;ubmitted, in its improved &s;tate, with all Deference and Re&s;pect.</P>

<HEAD>A TREATISE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE following pages being conceived to contain a pretty full account of the di&s;ea&s;es incident to childhood, and &s;ome of them &s;carcely known to preceding writers, may po&s;&s;ibly throw &s;ome additional light on this important &s;ubject. They are, in this hope, re&s;pectfully offered to the notice of &s;uch practitioners in phy&s;ic, as may not have made the complaints of children their parti|cular &s;tudy. The motives which have in|duced the writer to extend his plan to ano|ther cla&s;s of readers, it is pre&s;umed, may ju&s;tify &s;uch an attempt. He has, indeed, long lamented the very improper method in which the di&s;orders of infants are treated by tho&s;e who de&s;ign them the greate&s;t kind|ne&s;s, but who&s;e mi&s;taken opinions too often counteract their benevolent intentions. The laudable affection of the fonde&s;t mother fre|quently becomes a &s;ource of manifold injury to her tender offspring: And this is not only the ca&s;e among the lower cla&s;s of peo|ple,
<PB N="2" REF="026291_0019_0FCFAA20771E0028">
or in &s;ituations where medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance is procured with difficulty, but even in the metropolis it&s;elf, and in the higher ranks of the community, where many prejudices very hurtful to the ea&s;e and health of chil|dren &s;till prevail.</P>
<P>It is intelligent Parents therefore, as well as the medical world, to who&s;e notice this work is addre&s;&s;ed; and it is hoped, in the e&s;timation of both, no formal apology can be nece&s;&s;ary for taking up a &s;ubject, that has long called for a thorough inve&s;tigation.&mdash;For the manner in which it has been ex|ecuted, the author, indeed, again &s;olicits the candor of the public. The mo&s;t re&s;pec|table authorities, however, have been con|&s;ulted, a proper attention been paid to facts, and his be&s;t endeavours exerted to obviate the effects of that peculiar veil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is nothing to which this peculiar ob&s;cu|rity may be referred, but the incapacity of infants to de&s;cribe their own feelings.&mdash;There are, never|thele&s;s, other &s;ources of information, le&s;s fallaci|ous &s;ometimes than the more literal de&s;criptions of adults, which in nervous complaints particularly, would tend to perplex the able&s;t phy&s;ician if he &s;hould always be led by them; and the like di&s;cri|mination will &s;erve him equally well in the treat|ment of infants.</NOTE> which is &s;aid to ob&s;cure infantile di&s;orders. A prac|tical arrangement of them has been &s;tudi|ed, and regard had to their re&s;pective cau|&s;es and &s;ymptoms, tending to elucidate their
<PB N="3" REF="026291_0020_0FCFAA1E051010F8">
nature, and render their treatment more ob|vious than has been generally imagined.</P>
<P>To their immediate Di&s;ea&s;es, is added an attention to &s;ome of the principal Accidents and little Injuries to which infancy and childhood are peculiarly liable; which though not nece&s;&s;ary, indeed, for &s;ome readers, it is pre&s;umed will have their u&s;e, and may, po&s;&s;ibly, prove no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to others. And here it may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that whatever merit former publications may po&s;&s;e&s;s, it may, neverthele&s;s, with great propriety be remarked, that they either make a part of &s;ome large &s;y&s;tematic work, the bulk of which mu&s;t be foreign from the intentions of a tract of this kind, or el&s;e they are far too conci&s;e, and have o|mitted many complaints of too much import|ance to be overlooked.</P>
<P>It has been generally lamented by writers on the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, that this branch of medi|cine has remained too much uncultivated. And, indeed, till of later years, little more has been attempted than getting rid of the wild prejudices and anile pre&s;criptions of the old writers, which had too often &s;erved on|ly to ob&s;cure the true nature of children's di&s;ea&s;es. Another, and a very principal cau&s;e of &s;o &s;trange a neglect, has ari&s;en from an idea &s;ome people have entertained, that, as medical people can have but a very im|perfect knowledge of the complaints of in|fants,
<PB N="4" REF="026291_0021_0FCFAA190D87C690">
from the inability of children to give any account of them, it is &s;afer to intru&s;t the management of them to old women and nur&s;es; who, at lea&s;t, are not likely to do mi&s;chief by violent remedies, though they may &s;ometimes make u&s;e of improper and inadequate ones.</P>
<P>How fatal &s;uch a mi&s;take mu&s;t be, is &s;urely &s;ufficiently obvious; &s;ince the de|&s;truction of infants is eventually the de&s;truc|tion of adults, of population, wealth, and every thing that can prove u&s;eful to &s;ociety, or add to the &s;trength and grandeur of a kingdom. It may, moreover, be ob&s;erved, that where mi&s;management at this period does not actually de&s;troy the life, it often very e&s;&s;entially impairs the health; the foundation of a future good or bad con&s;ti|tion being frequently laid in a &s;tate of in|fancy.</P>
<P>It is true, indeed, &s;ome laudable attempts have been made of late years to re&s;cue this important tru&s;t from being indi&s;criminately committed to &s;uch dangerous hands; but it is &s;till to be lamented, that even in this libe|ral age, &s;uch attempts have not been at|tended with all the &s;ucce&s;s they have de|&s;erved. It cannot therefore be improper, that &s;omething farther &s;hould be advanced on the &s;ubject, in the hope of &s;ilencing the weak objections hitherto made again&s;t pro|curing the be&s;t advice as early as po&s;&s;ible.
<PB N="5" REF="026291_0022_0FCF8B68478435A8">
And this is the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t intere&s;t in the &s;ubject, the mo&s;t authority on the occa&s;ion, and the &s;incere&s;t affection for their offspring, have frequently the greate&s;t objections to medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, till it is, &s;ometimes, too late to employ it with effect.&mdash;I may, indeed, be very inadequate to the ta&s;k of obviating &s;uch prejudices, but I &s;hall &s;tate an argu|ment or two that has always appeared to me of great weight.</P>
<P>A principal objection, taken from the con|&s;ideration of the incapacity of infants to de|&s;cribe their complaints, has been &s;lightly no|ticed already, and has been more fully di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed in a treati&s;e written about twenty years &s;ince, by Dr. Arm&s;trong.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This edition did not contain more than a dozen di&s;ea&s;es; being confined to the hooping-cough, &s;cro|fula, teething, and the di&s;orders of the fir&s;t-pa&s;|&s;ages. In the year 1783, Dr. Arm&s;trong publi&s;h|ed a &s;econd edition con&s;iderably enlarged. It &s;o happened, that I had not &s;een it when the fir&s;t edi|tion of the pre&s;ent work appeared, or I &s;hould cer|taily have taken due notice of it, in regard to &s;eve|ral di&s;orders, mentioned in the Doctor's latter edi|tion; to which therefore I &s;hall now attend, as oc|ca&s;ion &s;hall offer.</NOTE> It is apt|ly remarked by this writer, that the &s;ame difficulty occurs in a variety of the mo&s;t dan|gerous complaints of adults at every period of life, which confe&s;&s;edly require the great|e&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;uch are attacks of phrenzy,
<PB N="6" REF="026291_0023_0FCF8B4F21EEF748">
delirium, and &s;ome kinds of convul&s;ions: to which may be added, all the di&s;orders of idiots and lunatics. But the&s;e have been &s;ucce&s;sfully treated in every age, not except|ing even lunacy it&s;elf, and the melancholy &s;ubject happily re&s;tored to &s;ociety, his fa|mily, and him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It has likewi&s;e been ob&s;erved, if infants for the rea&s;ons abovementioned are to be ex|cluded the benefit of a phy&s;ician's advice, it is difficult to &s;ay at what age children may &s;afely be intru&s;ted to his care; &s;ince at the age of five or &s;ix years, they would fre|quently mi&s;lead the enquirer, who &s;hould tru&s;t to their own account of their com|plaints. Their ideas of things are too in|di&s;tinct to afford us &s;ufficient information, and they accordingly often call &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, pain, and pain, &s;ickne&s;s; they will frequently make no reply to general que&s;tions, and when they are a&s;ked more particularly whether they have any pain in one or another part of the body, they al|mo&s;t certainly an&s;wer in the affirmative; though it afterwards frequently turns out they were mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>To this idea I will venture to add, that although infants can give no account of their complaints in the manner we receive information from adults, their di&s;ea&s;es are all plainly and &s;ufficiently marked by the countenance, the age, the manife&s;t &s;ymp|toms,
<PB N="7" REF="026291_0024_0FCFAA1793C71858">
and the faithful account given by the parent, or an intelligent nur&s;e. This I am &s;o confident of, that I never feel more at my ea&s;e, in pre&s;cribing for any di&s;orders than tho&s;e of infants, and never &s;ucceed with more uniformity, or more agreeable to the opinion I may have adopted of the &s;eat and nature of the di&s;ea&s;e. Every di&s;temper may be &s;aid, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, to have a language of its own, and it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the phy|&s;ician to be acquainted with it; nor do tho&s;e of children &s;peak le&s;s intelligibly.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In neither of the&s;e &s;entiments do I &s;tand alone; Harris, of who&s;e work Sydenham is thought to have &s;poken &s;o highly, has &s;aid the &s;ame things&mdash;"In|certae vero diagno&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s (quae multum obtinuit) que|rela non tam a &s;ymptomatum defect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, qu&agrave;m a prae|po&s;ter&acirc; ac inept&acirc; medendi ratione ortum &s;uum dux|i&s;&s;e videtur."

it Ob&s;ervation and long Experience, that can qualify a per&s;on for the &s;uperintendance of infants, or the treatment of their complaints?

<P>Having briefly &s;tated this matter, as I hope, with impartiality, and given it the attention its importance demands, I &s;hall next ob&s;erve, that, as the complaints of infants are more obvious than it has been generally &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;o their number is comparatively &s;mall, their cau&s;e uniform,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It may perhaps be objected to this idea, that their various di&s;ea&s;es cannot all originate from one and the <HI>&s;ame</HI> cau&s;e; nor is it my intention to a&s;&s;ert it, though it is, indeed, true, in regard to a great num|ber of them. It is to be remarked likewi&s;e, that it is the complaints of <HI>early infancy</HI> that are here particu|larly &s;poken of; though it is neverthele&s;s very evi|dent, that there is a greater <HI>uniformity</HI> al&s;o in the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of &s;everal di&s;orders even of older children, than there is in tho&s;e of adults, which have very often various, and di&s;&s;imular remote cau&s;es, at diffe|rent times, and in different habits: E.

<P><PB N="9" REF="026291_0026_0FCFAA11D9615850">
For the proof of this, as well as in order to e&s;tabli&s;h a rational practice, I &s;hall fir&s;t con|&s;ider the Cau&s;es and Diagno&s;tics, or &s;peci|fic nature of their complaints, before I at|tempt to enter upon their Cure.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall not attend to the various remote cau&s;es, but &s;hall confine my&s;elf to a practical con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject, and briefly point out their obvious occa&s;ions and &s;ymptoms. And on this account, I &s;hall not take notice of the various changes which nature her&s;elf induces during the growth of the infant, as it pa&s;&s;es from one &s;tage of life to another; which is, doubtle&s;s, a remote cau&s;e of &s;ome of their complaints.</P>
<P>A principal CAUSE, mentioned by anci|ent and modern writers, is the great moi&s;ture and laxity of infants; which is nece&s;&s;ary, however, in order to the exten&s;ion of parts, and the rapid growth of young children. This laxity ari&s;es from the va&s;t glandular &s;e|cretion, their glands in general being much larger in proportion, than tho&s;e of adults. I might in&s;tance in the thymus gland, and particularly in the pancreas and liver. But be&s;ides the&s;e, there are innumerable glands &s;ituate within the mouth, in the gullet, &s;to|mach and bowels, which are continually pouring out their contents into the fir&s;t-pa&s;|&s;ages. This is, doubtle&s;s, a wi&s;e provi&s;ion of nature, and I cannot, therefore, think with Dr. Arm&s;trong, that the ga&s;tric, or
<PB N="10" REF="026291_0027_0FCFAA0E011E83A8">
&s;tomach juice, renders the chyle le&s;s fit for ab&s;orption; but, as we do not &s;trictly fol|low her dictates in the management of chil|dren, as to their food, manner of clothing, &s;leeping, &amp;c. this abundance of &s;limy mat|ter may often overload the &s;tomach and bow|els, the con&s;tant &s;eat of the fir&s;t complaints in the infant &s;tate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Non quod aetas per &s;e &s;it cau&s;a illius morbi, e&s;t enim res naturalis et temporis determinatio, &s;ed quia di&s;ponit ad morbos quo&s;dam facilius &s;u&s;cipiendos, &s;i causae corum acce&s;&s;erint.&mdash;PRIMEROS: <HI>de Morb.

In addition to the&s;e gene|ral cau&s;es may be reckoned the want of ex|erci&s;e, which at a more advanced age, hap|pily for us, we are obliged to make u&s;e of, and which art, in general, does not duly &s;upply in regard to children.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exerci&s;e is the grand mean of health.&mdash;The ir|rational &s;pecies are capable of affording it to them|&s;elves almo&s;t as &s;oon as born; and though infant children are not, they are pa&s;&s;ive, and can be <HI>exer|ci&s;ed.</HI> Nature and in&s;tinct point out the expediency of it, and the fond mother who follows only her own inclination, naturally, and in&s;en&s;ibly adopts it, and is continually &s;troking and playing with the little idol of her heart, whenever it is awake; and as it grows older, &s;he is led on to give it more ex|erci&s;e, as it can bear it, and according to the &s;atis|faction the infant never fails to manife&s;t on the oc|ca&s;ion.</NOTE></P>

<P>THE Meconium is that black, vi&s;cid, or tenacious matter, which, it is well known, every infant parts with by &s;tool, for the two or three fir&s;t days after it is born, or retains it to its manife&s;t injury.</P>

place, that though it &s;hould not be all re|tained, yet a part will often remain much longer than has been u&s;ually imagined, and will come away, perhaps unnoticed, at a late period, where no retention of it has been &s;u&s;pected. Of this I can have no doubt, having been called to vi&s;it infants after the month has been expired, who have been unwell through all that period, for want of having been properly purged, and from whom meconium has &s;till been com|ing away. A tea-&s;poonful of ca&s;tor-oil, gi|ven once or more, has &s;oon carried off a great quantity; upon which all their com|plaints have di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>The meconium appears to be no longer of u&s;e after the child is come into the world, unle&s;s it be to keep the bowels from collap|&s;ing, till they be repleni&s;hed with the aliment the child is &s;oon afterwards to receive. Whereas, if it be not &s;oon carried off, it will not only change the quality of the milk, or other food, as it de&s;cends into the bowels, but it&s;elf al&s;o becomes highly acrid, (as it con|&s;i&s;ts chiefly of gall) and cannot fail to produce indige&s;tion, flatulency, pain, purging or co&s;tivene&s;s, and other &s;imilar evils: And the meconium is farther di&s;po&s;ed to this acrid &s;tate, on another account, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> from admixture of atmo&s;pheric air.

<HEAD>INWARD-FITS.</HEAD>
<P>ANY derangement of the fir&s;t-pa&s;&s;ages is capable of giving ri&s;e to various complaints, among which, that of inward-fits, has lately been taken notice of by &s;ome medical people, but I think &s;carcely de&s;erves the name of a di&s;ea&s;e. It demands atten|tion, however, becau&s;e &s;o much has been &s;aid about it as to expo&s;e the fond parent to continual apprehen&s;ions, left this &s;ubtile di&s;|ea&s;e &s;hould be in&s;en&s;ibly at work, and mak|ing way for more &s;evere and outward con|vul&s;ions.</P>
<P>A con&s;tant &s;ymptom in this kind of fit, as it is called, is the infant's little mouth being drawn into a &s;mile; which whoever has no|ticed mu&s;t have beheld it with plea&s;ure. And if the complaint extends no farther than this &s;miling, which is generally in its &s;leep, it ari&s;es merely from a little wind, and is cer|tainly harmle&s;s, becau&s;e the wind in this ca&s;e is not really confined; and therefore an immediate recour&s;e to pukes or purges, is more likely to do harm, by &s;training the &s;tomach, or by relaxing the bowels, than to do any good. Every body is acquainted with the effects of different degrees of irritation of the nerves, from the &s;en&s;ation produced by tickling with a feather, to that of a hard

gripe, or a violent &s;troke. The fir&s;t may be &s;aid to be plea&s;ing; and &s;uch, I doubt not, is the &s;timulus in que&s;tion on the ner|vous coat of the &s;tomach of little infants, and therefore produces &s;o agreeable a &s;mile, that I could never con&s;ider it as an indica|tion of pain. Indeed, I know of no com|plaint that ought to be termed inward fits; and I mention this, becau&s;e nur&s;es are continu|ally talking to us about them, when children are perfectly well, and often give the fond parent needle&s;s di&s;tre&s;s, as well as many an unplea&s;ant medicine to the child.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It were certainly a good rule, to admini&s;ter no medicine to infants for &s;uch &s;ymptoms as do not in|dicate &s;ome real complaint, unle&s;s where experience proves that &s;uch &s;ymptoms neglected are apt to fore|run &s;ome well known di&s;ea&s;e.</NOTE> They are at the &s;ame time treating the true con|vul&s;ion, whil&s;t &s;light, in the &s;ame way, be|ing led into the error by the ideas of inward fits; a term they are ever u&s;ing but have no preci&s;e ideas of, nor do any two of them mean the &s;ame thing by it.

<P>This complaint, however, is largely treat|ed of by &s;ome writers, and Dr. Arm&s;trong wi&s;hes to give a few drops of the wine of antimony; but it is very apparent, that when he con&s;iders it as worthy of more at|tention than I have ju&s;t now advi&s;ed, it is either a true convul&s;ion, in which the eyes are di&s;torted, and the mouth is di&s;compo&s;ed, in&s;tead of putting on a &s;mile, or el&s;e he is pre&s;cribing for another di&s;ea&s;e under the name of inward-fits, which former writers have treated under the head of di&s;orders ari&s;ing from co&s;tivene&s;s and wind.

is obvious, and upon the removal of it the remedy mu&s;t re&s;t.</P>
<P>Such has ever been my opinion of this much-talked-of complaint; and indeed I have not to this day, after a good deal of attention to infants, &s;een any thing my&s;elf to induce me alter it; or I would in this edition, have cheerfully retracted the pre|ceding ob&s;ervations. As I wi&s;h, however, to afford all the information I can on every complaint, I have to ob&s;erve, that it is con|ceived by &s;ome gentlemen of great re&s;pecta|bility and experience, that though the term, inward-fits, has been often mi&s;applied, there is really &s;uch a complaint, and that it gene|rally proves fatal. Be&s;ides a little bluene&s;s of the lips, and &s;light turning up of the eyes, often noticed by nur&s;es, this complaint is de&s;cribed to me as attended with a peculiar &s;ound of the voice (&s;omewhat like the croup) and a very quick breathing, at intervals; and is &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from a &s;pa&s;m of the &s;tomach, lungs, or other vital organ; a complaint I have indeed too frequently &s;een,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note, pages, 27, 28.</NOTE> but certainly very different from that u&s;ually known by inward-fits.</P>

from its cradle. They are likewi&s;e ob&s;erv|ed to be induced by &s;ucking or feeding, and to be increa&s;ed upon any little exertion of body, or tran&s;ient &s;urpri&s;e, and in this man|ner to recur for a length of time, before they become alarming. The remedies pro|po&s;ed for the cure of this complaint are an emetic, on the fir&s;t attack, and afterwards volatiles and fetids; but, as it has been ob|&s;erved, not often to good effect.</P>
<P>In regard to co&s;tivene&s;s and wind, which have been &s;aid to be the parent of what nur|&s;es commonly term inward-fits, as they do not always ari&s;e from one and the &s;ame cau&s;e, and are productive of other complaints than tho&s;e above mentioned, I &s;hall con&s;i|der them by them&s;elves; which, it is pre|&s;umed, will be pur&s;uing a more rational plan, than adhering to a term ob&s;cure in it&s;elf, and indicative of a di&s;ea&s;e not well defined, and which therefore may tend to mi&s;lead the generality of readers.</P>

<HEAD>DISORDERS ari&s;ing from COSTIVENESS and WIND.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been u&s;ual with ancient writers, when conci&s;ene&s;s and accuracy were not &s;o much con&s;idered as in the pre&s;ent day, to treat of co&s;tivene&s;s and wind as di&s;tinct heads of complaint; and for the rea&s;ons aforementioned, as well as from this little tract being calculated for general u&s;efulne&s;s, and not merely for medical readers, it may not be altogether improper to comply with this cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>Wind is but a mere &s;ymptom of &s;ome preceding or attending complaint; nor are its trouble&s;ome effects either occa&s;ioned or increa&s;ed by air taken in with the food, as many people have imagined; atmo&s;pheric air being e&s;&s;entially different from that pro|duced by indige&s;tion, whether owing to the weakne&s;s of the &s;tomach, as it is called, or the improper quality or quantity of the food taken into it. It may, however, prove a &s;ource of many complaints, and create watch|fulne&s;s, &s;tartings, hiccoughs, vomitings, and even convul&s;ions, if not timely attended to, e&s;pecially if the infant is co&s;tive.</P>
<P>Co&s;tivene&s;s is either con&s;titutional, or ac|cidental, which ought always to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, the former being oftentimes harm|le&s;s; and, indeed, children of &s;uch a ha|bit

of body are frequently the mo&s;t thriv|ing. If th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> mother &s;hould be very con&s;ti|pated, her children generally are &s;o; and &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, (whil&s;t they continue in health) ought not, I believe, to be coun|teracted, though it will be prudent careful|ly to watch it. And this will be e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary, in the ca&s;e of children who are &s;ubject to fits; fine lu&s;ty infants being often &s;eized with violent convul&s;ions, without a|ny other apparent cau&s;e than a natural co&s;|tive &s;tate of the bowels, and as uniformly recovered from the fits, merely by procur|ing &s;tools, and breaking off the wind. And this di&s;po&s;ition to fits has taken place long before the ordinary period of teething, and has continued till children have been a twelve-month old; at which time the &s;olids, and e&s;pecially the nervous &s;y&s;tem, has ap|peared to get &s;tronger. In &s;uch habits, a quarter of an ounce of manna, or the like quantity of the &s;yrup of ro&s;es, may be put into any liquid, and as much of it given by tea-&s;poonsful, as &s;hall open the belly: or a tea-&s;poonful of ca&s;tor-oil,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oil of ca&s;tor may be rendered very acceptable to children, if rubbed down with gum arabic, and a little manna, and afterwards made into a draught or mixture with &s;ome dill-water, and the addition of a drop or two of the compound &s;pirit of ammonia, where that may be proper.</NOTE> or from five to ten drops of the compound tincture of aloes,

may be taken two or three times a-week. And here it may not be u&s;ele&s;s to ob&s;erve, that rhubarb will not be a fit purgative, though it be joined with magne&s;ia, which will not &s;ufficiently counteract its re&s;tringen|cy. Another rea&s;on for objecting to this compound, is that of its being the almo&s;t con&s;tant pre&s;cription of nur&s;es on every oc|ca&s;ion, who&s;e <HI>indi&s;criminate</HI> u&s;e of it is ge|nerally needle&s;s, and &s;ometimes prejudicial; rhubarb alone, in ordinary ca&s;es, an&s;wering all the purpo&s;e intended, whil&s;t the magne|&s;ia makes an unnece&s;&s;ary addition to the bulk of the medicine, which &s;hould always be a|voided for children. A few grains of mag|ne&s;ia in a &s;poonful of water, and &s;weetened with a little manna, forms a much neater medicine, and in co&s;tive habits, which u&s;u|ally abound with acidity, an&s;wers very well in <HI>early</HI> infancy.</P>
<P>But if the child be otherwi&s;e in health, it has been &s;aid, it is, in general, inadvi&s;e|able to do much to counteract the natural habit of body. I have formerly, even dur|ing the month, directed manna, even to half an ounce at a time, to very little pur|po&s;e, unle&s;s it were almo&s;t daily repeated, and have at other times given from three to five grains of jalap; till I learned there are &s;ome con&s;titutions, even in infants, where the bowels cannot be kept open without a daily exhibition of &s;ome purgative medi|cine,
<PB N="34" REF="026291_0051_0FCFA9E3EC5C3B50">
and that many &s;uch children are as well left to them&s;elves, and require only to be watched. If a &s;tool &s;hould be wanted, however, a &s;uppo&s;itory made of a little &s;lip of paper, twi&s;ted up, and well moi&s;tened with oil, may be very ea&s;ily introduced, and will generally an&s;wer the purpo&s;e: or &s;hould this fail, a bit of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> &s;oap may be intro|duced in like manner.</P>
<P>Should &s;uch a co&s;tive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the bowels produce griping pains, which may be known by the drawing up of the legs, or of the &s;crotum, and a certain manner of crying; or &s;hould the co&s;tivene&s;s be accidental, it mu&s;t &s;peedily be remedied; and if the oc|ca&s;ion of it be an improper food, which is very often the ca&s;e, the food mu&s;t imme|diately be changed. If the child be not u&s;ually co&s;tive, rhubarb<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some writers have in this ca&s;e recommended oil, and particularly the <HI>French,</HI> who admini&s;ter oil of almonds to infants much too frequently.

complaint, e&s;pecially if brought up by hand. It &s;ometimes happens, however, that much more powerful medicines than rhubarb may be required, whether the child be natural|ly co&s;tive, or not; and in &s;uch ca&s;es, much caution is nece&s;&s;ary on the part of parents and nur&s;es: For, where a proper do&s;e of &s;enna-tea has proved ineffectual, it is &s;ur|pri&s;ing what large do&s;es even of rough pur|ges have been given in vain, or &s;ometimes to the injury of the child. On &s;uch occa|&s;ions, I would rather advi&s;e a recour&s;e to cly&s;ters, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e made of &s;uc|cotorine aloes. From five to twenty grains, according to the age of the infant, di&s;&s;olved in boiled milk, will rarely, if ever fail of procuring two or three &s;tools, e&s;pecially if preceded by the exhibition of a purge.

in the bowels, which had long continued ob&s;tinate, though, in other re&s;pects, pro|perly treated.</P>
<P>As there is u&s;ually too much acidity in the fir&s;t-pa&s;&s;ages in co&s;tive and windy habits, a little magne&s;ia may be given for a few days after the co&s;tivene&s;s has been remov|ed; and if the child be &s;uckled, the nur&s;e's diet mu&s;t be attended to. If any flatulency &s;hould &s;till remain, (which will not often be the ca&s;e if it has ari&s;en merely from con&s;ti|pation) a little dill-water is the mo&s;t harm|le&s;s carminative. But &s;hould it be an atten|dant upon a lax &s;tate of the bowels and in|dige&s;tion, its remedy will con&s;i&s;t in the re|moval of tho&s;e complaints, which will be noticed in their place.</P>
<P>I have hitherto &s;poken chiefly of Co&s;tive|ne&s;s; wind being, however, likewi&s;e &s;ome|times a real complaint, though it &s;hould not happen to be &s;o confined as to become an occa&s;ion of fits. The only in&s;tances of this kind, indeed, that I remember having &s;een, have been in new-born and very lu&s;ty infants, who&s;e mothers have al&s;o been pecu|liarly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by affections of that kind. This is, indeed, a &s;omewhat anile way of &s;peaking, but it &s;tates the preci&s;e fact; and one in&s;tance of an infant &s;uffering in this way was &s;o remarkable, that it may be worth no|ticing in this place.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, the meconium began to pa&s;s off &s;oon after birth, but not without repeat|ed
<PB N="37" REF="026291_0054_0FCFA9DD0D467BB8">
cly&s;ters, purgatives, and the warm-bath, and was peculiarly vi&s;cid, as well as in va&s;t quantity. Neverthele&s;s, the infant appear|ed, for &s;everal days, likely to be &s;trangled, and was black in the face, merely through the abundance of wind in the fir&s;t-pa&s;&s;ages; though it was continually breaking off both by the mouth and the bowels, and by that peculiar, and very loud noi&s;e, when it came upwards, frequently ob&s;erved in the hy&s;te|rical &s;pa&s;m of adults, and continuing for &s;e|veral hours together, &s;o that the infant was often thought to be dying. The whole face, except the no&s;e, became exceedingly &s;welled, &s;o that the infant could &s;carcely open its eyes, though without any di&s;co|louration of the &s;kin; being probably ow|ing to wind diffu&s;ed through the cellular membrane; the tumor &s;ub&s;iding immedi|ately upon getting rid of the wind from the &s;tomach and bowels.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ymptoms, however, yielded to carminative juleps, and purging medicines; and the infant after the meconium was all come away, was freed from every com|plaint, without any farther &s;emblance of fits, though frequently apprehended.</P>

perhaps the aggravation of the &s;ymptoms, and con&s;equent di&s;tre&s;s of the patient, where upon due knowledge of the di&s;ea&s;e, art has, evidently, nothing to offer.

<P>The milder &s;pecies of it appears often on the fingers and hands, or the feet and an|kles, and &s;ometimes upon, or near the joints, forming matter in a very &s;hort time. The more violent kind is almo&s;t always &s;eated about the pubis, and extends upwards on the belly, and down the thighs and legs; though I have two or three times &s;een it begin in the neck. The &s;welling is but mo|derate, but after becoming hard, the parts turn purple, livid, and very often mortify; e&s;pecially in boys, when it falls on the &s;cro|tum; the penis &s;wells, and the prepuce puts on that kind of emphy&s;ematous, or windy appearance, which it has in children when a &s;tone is &s;ticking in the pa&s;&s;age; or in the drop&s;y of the &s;crotum.</P>

<HEAD>APTHAE, or THRUSH.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING con&s;idered the above early com|plaints, I return to tho&s;e which owe their immediate origin to &s;ome affection of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, as they are called.</P>
<P>It is among&s;t the vulgar errors, that the thru&s;h is a very harmle&s;s complaint, or is even de&s;irable to a child in the month; for it is &s;aid, if it does not then make its ap|pearance, it certainly will at a more advanc|ed age, and will then prove fatal, or will, at lea&s;t, attend the patient in his la&s;t illne&s;s.

From the above mi&s;take, however, the di&s;|order is often neglected in the beginning, whereby the acidity in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages is &s;uffered to increa&s;e, which always aggra|vates the complaint. It is, indeed, a much milder di&s;order in this i&s;land than on mo&s;t parts of the Continent (through <HI>a priori</HI> we might perhaps, &s;upo&s;e it would be other|wi&s;e) particularly in <HI>France,</HI> where it reigns as a malignant epidemic, e&s;pecially in the

<P>This di&s;order is &s;o well known, as &s;carce|ly to require any de&s;cription, and generally appears fir&s;t in the angles of the lips, and then on the tongue and cheeks, in the form

of little white &s;pecks. The&s;e increa&s;ing in number and &s;ize, run together more or le&s;s, according to the degree of malignity, and compo&s;e a thin, white cru&s;t, which at length lines the whole in&s;ide of the mouth, from the lips even to the gullet, and is &s;aid to ex|tend into the &s;tomach, and through the length of the bowels; producing al&s;o a red|ne&s;s about the anus. When the cru&s;t falls off, it is frequently &s;ucceeded by others, which are u&s;ually of a darker colour than the former. But this is true only in the wor&s;t kind of thru&s;h; for there is a milder &s;ort, that is &s;pread thinly over the lips and tongue, which returns a great many times, and always la&s;ts for &s;everal weeks. I have &s;een this &s;o very often the ca&s;e, that when I ob&s;erve a child to have the complaint very very lightly, and that it does not increa&s;e after two or three days, I venture to pro|nounce it will continue a long time, but will be of no con&s;equence. Care, however, ought to be taken that the child be not ex|po&s;ed to cold.</P>
<P>The thru&s;h is &s;aid to be generally attend|ed with fever, but this is not u&s;ually the ca&s;e where the thru&s;h is an original di&s;ea&s;e but when con&s;equent to &s;evere bowel com|plaints, ery&s;ipelas, and other infantile di&s;or|ders, it is, indeed, often accompanied with fever, and when &s;o, proves either favoura|bly critical, or the infant u&s;ually &s;inks very

&s;oon. In ordinary ca&s;es, however, I am confident in nine out of ten, there is not the lea&s;t fever, though the mouth is of|ten &s;o much heated, as to excoriate the niples of the nur&s;e, and becomes &s;o tender, that the child is often ob&s;erved to &s;uck with reluctance and caution.&mdash;It is an old ob&s;er|vation among&s;t nur&s;es, and there is &s;ome foundation for it, that very long &s;leeping, in the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t week or two, is often a forerunner of this complaint.</P>
<P>It has long been a received opinion, that the thru&s;h mu&s;t appear at the anus, and nur&s;es will &s;eldom allow it to be cured if it does not; but the truth is, that its appear|ance there is only a mark of the degree of the di&s;ea&s;e, and not in the lea&s;t of its cure, and is not, therefore, generally to be wi&s;h|ed for. The redne&s;s about this part is oc|ca&s;ioned by the &s;harpne&s;s of the &s;ecretions in the bowels, and con&s;equently of the &s;tools, which lightly inflame and &s;ometimes excoriate the parts about the anus, and in a bad thru&s;h will do &s;o long before the com|plaint is going off; but in the lighter kind, no &s;uch effects are produced, or are, at lea&s;t, very &s;light. And, indeed, this redne&s;s has been &s;o often mentioned to me as an indica|tion that infants mu&s;t certainly have already had a &s;light thru&s;h, or be likely to &s;uffer by it very &s;oon, where children have e&s;caped it altogether; that I have ventured to imagine

&s;uch infants may be lea&s;t of all liable to it, if otherwi&s;e in good health; at lea&s;t, my experience &s;eems hitherto to &s;upport that idea.

<P>Much has been &s;aid in favor of emetics, e&s;pecially wine of antimony, as being almo&s;t a &s;pecific for this di&s;ea&s;e, but I cannot &s;ay it has proved &s;o with me; nor can I &s;ee any &s;ufficient cau&s;e for departing from the more ancient practice, in the treatment of this very common complaint.</P>
<P>There can be no objection, after having properly opened the bowels, to admini&s;ter|ing an emetic, and where the thru&s;h is of a dark colour, and the whole in&s;ide of the cheeks are lined with it, I believe it will be u&s;eful, by emptying the &s;tomach of the crude juices oozing into it from the glands of this part. But, I think it would be almo&s;t as endle&s;s, as it would generally be prejudicial, to per&s;evere in the u&s;e of emetics, for days, and even weeks together, and is both a &s;e|vere, and an unnatural method of treating

a tender infant, in which the bowels are al|ways the mo&s;t natural outlet for its com|plaints; on which, therefore, nature uniform|ly throws the offending matter on almo&s;t every occa&s;ion, as appears plainly in teeth|ing, in which the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages cannot be primarily affected.</P>
<P>I believe, therefore, where there is no fever, nor any uncommon &s;ymptom, te&s;ta|ceous powders are the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t reme|dy; which may be joined with a little mag|ne&s;ia, if the body be co&s;tive; or if in the other extreme, and the child is very weak|ly, two or three grains of the compound powder of contrayerva in its &s;tead.

<P>The choice of the te&s;taceous powders, on which &s;ome writers have &s;aid &s;o much, is, I believe, of very little importance; the pure&s;t and &s;ofte&s;t are preferable. The de|&s;ign of the&s;e medicines, being to ab&s;orb and correct the predominant acidity,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French phy&s;icians are of opinion, that the thru&s;h is owing to what they call a putrid alcaline humour, or &s;omething analogous thereto, rather than to an acid.

<P><PB N="56" REF="026291_0073_0FCFA9B86BB7D560">
In regard to applications to the part, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that as they have lit|tle to do in curing the complaint, it will be improper to have recour&s;e to them very ear|ly. I know, indeed, it is very common to begin with them, but they &s;erve only to in|crea&s;e the &s;orene&s;s of the parts, (e&s;pecially in the manner they are generally u&s;ed) and to give a deceitful appearance of amendment. If the in&s;ide of the cheeks and tongue are thickly covered with &s;loughs, it may &s;ome|times be convenient to clean the mouth once a day; but it will in general be u&s;ele&s;s, till the complaint is pa&s;t the height, the &s;loughs di&s;po&s;ed to fall off, and the parts under|neath inclined to heal. Proper applications will then have their u&s;e, both by keeping the mouth clean, and con&s;tricting and heal|ing the raw, and open mouths of the excre|tory ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, an hundred different lotions and gargles have been invented, which from the earlie&s;t times have all been of an a&s;tringent nature.&mdash;Honey of ro&s;es and &s;pirit of vitriol, or of &s;ea-&s;alt, as re|commended by Etmuller and Dr. Shaw, form a very good one; but nothing is pre|ferable to borax, which &s;ome advi&s;e to be mixed up with &s;ugar, in the proportion of one part of the former to &s;even of the latter: a pinch of this put upon the child's tongue will be licked to all parts of the mouth. But
<PB N="57" REF="026291_0074_0FCF8B34A970CF78">
I prefer a mixture of borax and common honey, (about two &s;cruples or a dram of the former to an ounce of the latter) which hangs about the fauces better than in the form of powder. Either of the&s;e may be made u&s;e of as often in the day as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to keep the parts clean, which they will effectually do, without putting the infant to pain, by being forcibly rubbed on. I mu&s;t own, I have frequently been di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed, at &s;eeing nur&s;es rub the mouth of a lit|tle infant, with a rag-mop, as they term it, till they have made it bleed; and this ope|ration they will often repeat half a dozen times in a day.</P>
<P>It only remains to take notice of the black thru&s;h, as it is called, which is confe&s;&s;edly a very uncommon complaint in the infant &s;tate. Dr. Arm&s;trong &s;ays he has never met with it. I have &s;een only two in&s;tances of it, which were in &s;trong and healthy chil|dren; but the parts were not perfectly black, and if that be intended by the name, the&s;e ca&s;es might not be preci&s;ely that complaint: they, however, both proved fatal. After the &s;tomach and bowels have been clean&s;ed, I believe, a decoction of the bark, with a little aromatic confection, is the mo&s;t likely medicine to be of &s;ervice, and is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary in the wor&s;t kind of common thru&s;h, when the &s;ucceeding &s;loughs are ve|ry

The early ones may be regarded as a &s;ort of red-gum, and children who are mo&s;t &s;ubject to them, generally have their bowels in a better &s;tate; the ra&s;h carrying off, as has been &s;aid, the acidity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Harris, Pages 22, 23.</NOTE> with which they &s;o much abound.</P>
<P>It may be remarked, however, that when infants at the brea&s;t are inclined to frequent returns of &s;ome eruption on the &s;kin, if the child be always indi&s;po&s;ed at &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons, the ra&s;h will often be found owing to &s;ome ill quality in the brea&s;t of milk, which ought therefore to be examined, and particularly in regard to its ta&s;te. On &s;uch occa&s;ions I
<PB N="61" REF="026291_0078_0FCFA9B29135D2A0">
have found, that milk which has been above a twelve-month old, has contracted <HI>a very unplea&s;ant</HI> flavour, and that upon changing the wet nur&s;e, a very ill looking ra&s;h has &s;oon afterwards entirely di&s;appeared, toge|ther with the other complaints.</P>
<P>One &s;pecies of the&s;e early ra&s;hes often takes place about the time of teething, and not unfrequently at the decline of fevers or &s;evere bowel complaints; in&s;omuch that, upon a &s;udden appearance of it during a &s;e|rious illne&s;s, I have often ventured to prog|no&s;ticate the recovery. This ra&s;h very much re&s;embles the itch, both in regard to the little watery heads and foul blotches; and is confined to no particular part of the body, though it appears more frequently about the face and neck. Indeed, I have &s;een the whole body &s;o covered with it (and mixed with an eruption about the face, of a different appearance, and evidently red-gum) that in a con&s;ultation, it has been by &s;ome taken to be the true itch. This eruption is certainly &s;alutary, and even critical, requires nothing but to avoid taking cold, and is mentioned only becau&s;e it is not an uncom|mon appearance, and parents who are un|acquainted with it, are apt to be alarmed at it.</P>
<P>But there is a very common ra&s;h that calls for more attention, and to which medical writers have given the name of <HI>Cru&s;ta lacte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="62" REF="026291_0079_0FCFA9B0F1858938">
(Lactumen,</HI> or milk blotches), which has a very unplea&s;ant appearance, but is not|with&s;tanding equally innocent with the for|mer, and even prevents other complaints. I think I never &s;aw an infant much loaded with it, but it has always been healthy, and cut its teeth remarkably well. Indeed, it falls to the lot of the fine&s;t children, and &s;uch as are well nouri&s;hed; whence &s;ome have imagined it owing only to the richne&s;s of the milk.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See A&s;truc</NOTE> And it is remarkable in this eruption, that however thick and long-con|tinued the &s;cabs may be, the cru&s;ta lactea never excoriates, nor leaves any &s;car on the parts.</P>
<P>It appears fir&s;t on the forehead, and &s;ome|times on the &s;calp, often extends half-way over the face, in the form of large loo&s;e &s;cabs, and appears not very unlike the &s;mall pox after they are turned. Very little, I believe, is nece&s;&s;ary to be done; but in bad ca&s;es a perpetual bli&s;ter may &s;ometimes be of &s;ervice. It u&s;ually di&s;appears of it&s;elf when the child has cut three or four teeth, though it may &s;ometimes continue for &s;eve|ral months, and in a very few in&s;tances even for years: in &s;uch ca&s;es, the <HI>Harrowgate,</HI> or any other &s;ulphureous water will have a good effect; but the medicines commonly pre&s;cri|bed do nothing. I have known te&s;taceous
<PB N="63" REF="026291_0080_0FCFA9AF61405828">
powders and various alteratives admini&s;tered to no purpo&s;e, as people of rank are very anxious to have it removed if it be po&s;&s;ible. I was lately con&s;ulted for a child who had taken a grain of calomel, at &s;hort intervals, for &s;everal months without any benefit, and fortunately without any injury; which is rarely the ca&s;e when powerful medicines are admini&s;tered unnece&s;&s;arily. This ra&s;h will now and then make make its appearance very early, and has then been mi&s;taken by tho&s;e who are not much accu&s;tomed to very young children, for the effects the venereal di&s;ea&s;e. I not long ago &s;aw &s;uch a ca&s;e, and advi&s;ed only to keep the body open with a little magne&s;ia; the complaint got no wor&s;e, and upon cutting &s;ome teeth, di&s;ap|peared as u&s;ual. I have known it, howe|ver, di&s;appear &s;uddenly, previou&s;ly to any teeth being cut, and after &s;ome weeks be|come more violent than ever; the infant re|maining all the while in perfect health.</P>
<P>It were almo&s;t endle&s;s to enumerate the various kinds of ra&s;h to which infants are liable, but I mean chiefly to confine my re|marks to the more important, or rare ones, and &s;uch as may not have been de&s;cribed by preceding writers. Among &s;uch is the fol|lowing, who&s;e unu&s;ual appearance are apt to alarm parents and others, not accu&s;tomed to &s;ee them.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="026291_0081_0FCFA9AE191A3948">
The fir&s;t I &s;hall notice appears chiefly in teething children, very much re&s;embles the mea&s;les, and has been &s;ometimes mi&s;taken for it. It is preceded by &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;to|mach, but is it attended with very little fe|ver, though the ra&s;h continues very florid for three days, like the mea&s;les, but does not dry off in the manner of that di&s;ea&s;e. It requires nothing more than the &s;hell-pow|ders, or &s;ometimes the addition of a little nitre and compound powder of contrayerva, with a do&s;e or two of rhubarb, or other gentle laxative, on the going off of the ra&s;h.</P>
<P>An eruption &s;till le&s;s frequently met with appears &s;ometimes after children have cut all their fir&s;t teeth. I know not what name ought to be given to this kind of eruption, which breaks out in the form of round lumps as large as midling-&s;ized peas, very hard, with a very red ba&s;e, and white at the top, as if they contained a little lymph.</P>
<P>They come out &s;uddenly without previous &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, are not &s;ore, di&s;|po&s;ed to itch, nor ever give any trouble, and are &s;eldom &s;een but on parts that are u&s;ually uncovered, and are &s;ometimes there in great numbers, re&s;embling the di&s;tinct &s;mall-pox; but are harder, more inflamed, and le&s;s purulent.</P>
<P>Alarming, as well as unu&s;ual, as is this appearance, I believe the eruption is always
<PB N="65" REF="026291_0082_0FCFA9A8EDCB8A90">
perfectly harmle&s;s, if not repelled by cold, or improper treatment; and will dry away in three or four days: nothing more being nece&s;&s;ary than the little remedies, directed for the former, and to keep the child with|in doors, if the weather be cold.</P>
<P>An eruption of an appearance equally un|common and analogous to the above, I have met with only in children of at lea&s;t three or four years of age, and &s;uch as have al&s;o been affected with &s;light &s;ymptoms of &s;crofu|la; though I have not &s;een it frequently enough to a&s;certain its being, in any de|gree, owing to that &s;pecific virus. It breaks out &s;uddenly, covering at once the greater part of the body, but occa&s;ioning neither pain nor itching, nor are children &s;ick at the &s;tomach nor otherwi&s;e ill with it, though it la&s;ts for two or three weeks.</P>
<P>This eruption, therefore, like &s;ome others, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> taken notice of chiefly for its &s;in|gular appearance, which, though &s;ome|what like the nettle-ra&s;h, is of a different figure, but may be pretty exactly conceived of by the little red lumps &s;ometimes left by &s;mall-pox, after they are turned, and al&s;o rubbed, or picked off; e&s;pecially after the chry&s;talline or warty &s;pecies, and where the pu&s;tules have been pretty numerous.</P>
<P>If the fir&s;t-pa&s;&s;ages are at all di&s;turbed, my attention is principally directed to them, otherwi&s;e to the &s;tate of the &s;kin; and in
<PB N="66" REF="026291_0083_0FCFA99F9E0B9EB0">
this ca&s;e, I have u&s;ually directed &s;mall do&s;es of Dr James's powder, to be taken for a few nights at going to bed, and the poly|chre&s;t &s;alt and rhubarb, occa&s;ionally, in the cour&s;e of the day, with or without the ad|dition of a little of the acitated water of am|monia.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of a few days the eruption puts on a darker colour, is le&s;s prominent, and begins to &s;cale off in a branny &s;curf, &s;omewhat like the mea&s;les: but &s;hould no &s;uch change take place, the vinum antimonii &s;hould be taken two or three times a day; to which, if no amendment &s;hould &s;oon be perceived, a few drops of the tinctura can|tharidis may be added; a remedy often ve|ry efficacious in di&s;orders of the &s;kin; but &s;hould be admini&s;tered with caution.</P>
<P>Another ra&s;h, or rather eruption, takes place both in bowel complaints and in teething, and always appears to be benefi|cial. It con&s;i&s;ts of ve&s;ications or bli&s;ters of different &s;izes, re&s;embling little &s;calds or burns, and continues for &s;everal days. They come out in different parts, but chiefly on the belly, ribs, and thighs; and contain a &s;harp lymph, which it may be prudent to let out by a puncture with a needle, e&s;peci|ally from the larger ones. No medicine is nece&s;&s;ary but &s;uch as the particular &s;tate of the bowels may call for, which u&s;ualy abound
<PB N="67" REF="026291_0084_0FCFA99D6C445238">
with acidity whenever there is much erup|tion on the &s;kin.</P>
<P>An eruption, vulgarly termed &s;corbutic, infe&s;ting the face and neck, and di&s;charging a &s;harp ichor that excoriates wherever it runs, and difficult of cure by chemical alte|ratives, will often yield in a very &s;hort time to the expre&s;&s;ed juice of the <HI>&s;ium aquaticum.</HI> From one, to four or five table &s;poonfuls may be given, mixed with one or more lpoonful of new milk, three times a day, according to the child's age, and the &s;tate of its &s;tomach; taking care at the &s;ame time, to keep the bowels open by &s;enna-tea or other common laxative.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this account with a de&s;cription of an eruption that is &s;ingular enough, re|&s;embling very much the herpes or broad|ring worm, or the adu&s;t-coloured &s;pots left on the face after an attack of St. Anthony's fire. I have &s;een it in various parts, but I think only on &s;uch as are more or le&s;s liable to be fretted by &s;ome part of the infant's dre&s;s, e&s;pecially on the nates and contigu|ous parts covered by the cloths, where the blotches are always the broade&s;t and mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ank. Were it to appear no where el&s;e, it would &s;eem to be occa&s;ioned by &s;ome &s;harp|ne&s;s of the urine and &s;tools, as the &s;kin has a very heated appearance, though the erup|tion, I believe, is not at all painful. It fre|quently breaks out before the period of
<PB N="68" REF="026291_0085_0FCFA99BEB375EA8">
teething, but the bowels are generally &s;ome|what di&s;ordered, and the &s;tools voided very green, or el&s;e become &s;o very &s;oon afterwards. This I take to be one of tho&s;e eruptions oc|ca&s;ioned by &s;ome bad quality of the brea&s;t-milk as I have never met with it but in young infants who&s;e nur&s;e's milk has been old, and has al&s;o contracted a very di&s;agreeable ta&s;te. If that &s;hould not be the ca&s;e, the ra&s;h will probably require nothing but the light ab|&s;orbent medicines before mentioned, and to guard again&s;t con&s;tipation. But if the&s;e means &s;hould not &s;ucceed in a &s;hort time, the nur&s;e ought to be changed.</P>
<P>In all the eruptive complaints of infants, taking cold ought to be carefully avoided, and great caution be u&s;ed in regard to all external applications, as well as keeping the belly open. If the child is &s;ick at the &s;to|mach, a little magne&s;ia, te&s;taceous powders, or the compound powder of contrayerva joined with them, may be given now and then; or &s;hould the ra&s;h be ha&s;tily &s;truck in, and the child be ill, it &s;hould be immediately put into a warm-bath and afterwards take five or &s;ix grains of the aromatic confection, with, or without a few drops of the wine of antimony, in &s;imple mint water.</P>
<P>Should any &s;cabs become very dry and hard, which the <HI>cru&s;ta lactea</HI> will &s;ometimes be, e&s;pecially when they extend to the
<PB N="69" REF="026291_0086_0FCFA9998E9EEB80">
crown of the head, and &s;eem to give pain, they may be touched with a little cream, or with oil of almonds mixed with a few drops of the water of kali; but not a large &s;ur|face at a time.

<HEAD>SORE EARS.</HEAD>
<P>SLIGHT bli&s;ters and ulcerations behind the ears of infants are &s;o very common, that almo&s;t every parent is well-acquainted with them, and in general require only to be wa&s;hed with cold water, or covered with a &s;inged rag, to keep the cap from &s;ticking to them, and thereby giving the child pain. They are, moreover, often very u&s;eful, e&s;|pecially during bowel complaints, or the eruption of the teeth. But there is in &s;ome children of a gro&s;s habit of body, and e&s;|pecially about the time of teething, a &s;pe|cies of ulcer that often requires attention, on account of its extending low down in the neck, occa&s;ioning great pain, and &s;preading
<PB N="70" REF="026291_0087_0FCFA99897003EA0">
into large and deep &s;ores, in&s;omuch that a mortification has &s;ometimes come on, and even the <HI>proce&s;&s;us ma&s;toideus</HI> has become ca|rious.

Such ca&s;es, however, do not often occur; but whenever the &s;ores are large the cure &s;hould be begun by a bli&s;ter on the back, in order to draw off the heated &s;erum that flows to the parts. I have u&s;ually given an opening powder of te&s;tecea and rhubarb, with a little nutmeg, and &s;ometimes nitre, to which is added either calomel, cinnabar of antimony, or <HI>hydrargyrus cum &s;ulphure;</HI> the latter of which, I think I have found more &s;ervice|able in &s;ome eruptive complaints in young children, than &s;eem to be generally imagin|ed.

<P>VOMITING is certainly not a common complaint of infants, I mean when con|&s;idered as a <HI>di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> unle&s;s it be attendant upon &s;ome other, of which it is then rather a &s;ymptom, or the con&s;equence of &s;uch di&s;|ea&s;e improperly treated. Neither are in|fants in health di&s;po&s;ed to vomit frequently, unle&s;s the &s;tomach is overloaded, the milk is then u&s;ually ejected as &s;oon as it is taken, and comes up unchanged. Nor is this to be con&s;idered as a di&s;ea&s;e, or as calling for the di&s;cipline recommended by &s;ome writers. Wherefore &s;hould the re&s;idue of the ali|ment be forced off the &s;tomach by an eme|tic, when it has already parted with all the oppre&s;&s;ive abundance? This kind of puking is not attended with any violence to the &s;to|mach: the milk, or other food &s;eems to
<PB N="72" REF="026291_0089_0FCF8B31DC8D20B8">
come up without an &s;en&s;ible action of the &s;tomach, or the child being &s;ick. Nay, it is at once &s;o common to &s;ome of the fine&s;t children, that it is a &s;aying with &s;ome old nur&s;es, (though I am not very partial to many of their proverbs) that a puking child is a thriving child; and when &s;uch ejection comes only &s;oon after &s;ucking or feeding, and the aliment is ca&s;t up, &s;carcely changed, matter of fact verifies the ob&s;er|vation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See PRIMEROS: <HI>De Morbis Infant.</HI></NOTE> But if the food remains &s;ome time on the &s;tomach, it will then be thrown up in a curdled &s;tate, which is an indication to attend to it, if it happens frequently. Not that the milk ought not to curdle on the &s;tomach, which it always mu&s;t do, in order to a due &s;eparation of its component parts, and is the chief, if not the only di|ge&s;tion, it undergoes in the &s;tomach.

This curdling of the milk, therefore, is the natural cour&s;e of dige&s;tion, though many writers have not been &s;ufficiently attentive to it, and Harris has a&s;&s;erted it is owing to a predominant acid. But when the milk comes up in a curdled &s;tate, it proves that the &s;to|mach having dige&s;ted what it had received, hath not power to pu&s;h it forward into the bowels, and therefore throws up a part of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have known a child throw up a piece of curd full as large as the thumb of a grown per&s;on, and as firm as a piece of dough; and be perfectly well the next minute.&mdash;When infants, not over-fed, throw up the milk uncurdled, after it has been &s;ometime in the &s;tomach, it is always a wor&s;e &s;ign.</NOTE> If this be the ca&s;e, the &s;tomach may perhaps require to be emptied of its whole contents, which may be ea&s;ily done by giv|ing a little warm water, or camomile tea.

<P>If the vomiting, on the other hand, has ari&s;en from acrid diet, a little farther di&s;ci|pline may be requi&s;ite, becau&s;e &s;ome half-dige&s;ted food has got into the bowels, per|haps for &s;everal days together.

<P>Having mentioned emetics, I &s;hall take this occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that the choice of them will be always be&s;t determined by the na|ture of the complaints for which they are ad|mini&s;tered.

If a child be not hungry, or hurt by &s;ome parts of its dre&s;s, there are always &s;ymptoms attending, that will account for its crying, and other expre&s;&s;ions of pain. The cau&s;e is, indeed, very commonly in its bowels, and may be increa&s;ed by co&s;tivene&s;s, which has already been treated of, but more commonly mani|fe&s;ts it&s;elf by a purging, which comes next in order to be con&s;idered.</P>

<HEAD>PURGING.</HEAD>
<P>UNDER the article of vomiting it was ob|&s;erved, that frequent puking is oftentimes an attendant upon &s;ome other complaint, and then demands a peculiar attention, and is to be treated agreeably to the nature of &s;uch complaints; and there is, perhaps, none which it more frequently accompanies than a Diarrhoea, or Purging.</P>
<P>Vomiting and Purging very often ari&s;e from unwhole&s;ome milk or other food, from a moi&s;t cold air, or from the &s;udden di&s;ap|pearance of &s;ome eruption on the &s;kin. The purging is not then ha&s;tily to be &s;topped, nor even ab&s;orbent powders to be given, till the offen&s;ive matter be fir&s;t carried off; and if a vomiting attend, the cure &s;hould begin by admini&s;tering an emetic. But though the purging ought not to be checked with|out previous evacuations, nor to be &s;topped ha&s;tily, yet it is not to be treated with a daily exhibition of rhubarb, which though a common practice with many, &s;erves to keep up a purging after the cau&s;e has been remov|ed, by creating a continual irritation in the bowels. The <HI>diarrhoea,</HI> indeed, is a com|plaint often as difficult to treat as any in the infant &s;tate, and is therefore worthy of par|ticular attention. In a general way it may
<PB N="78" REF="026291_0095_0FCFA98B4FA14438">
be &s;aid, that a &s;ufficient do&s;e or two of rhu|barb &s;hould be admini&s;tered in the beginning, and afterwards ab&s;orbents. If the purging &s;hould &s;till continue, an emetic will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, as purges do not always lie long enough in the &s;tomach to carry off the offen|&s;ive matter it contains. After this, it is often nece&s;&s;ary, the child &s;hould be purged again, for it &s;hould be always remembered, that many complaints of infants, whether &s;eated only in the fir&s;t-pa&s;&s;ages, or attended with fever, will frequently &s;eem to be giving way upon procuring &s;tools freely, but will &s;oon return if the &s;ame means be not repeat|ed, till the whole irritating matter be carried down. Should &s;uch repetition fail of &s;uc|ce&s;s, though the diet has been carefully at|tended to, the u&s;e of them at pre&s;ent &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, and recour&s;e &s;hould again be had to ab&s;orbents, and if there be no fever, to light cordials, and even to opiates, with|out the latter of which, many bowel com|plaints will not admit of a la&s;ting cure, ow|ing to the great irritability of infants. Such medicines are not indeed very often requir|ed till children are &s;ome months old: but when they are found nece&s;&s;ary, not only may &s;yrup of white poppies, but even laudanum be given with the mo&s;t perfect &s;afety;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the half of a drop, to two, or three drops, in the cour&s;e of the day, will be a proper quantity for infants from a week old, to the age of &s;ix months.</NOTE>
<PB N="79" REF="026291_0096_0FCF8B26EAE0A770">
though from the time of <HI>Galen,</HI> (who cau|tions again&s;t giving theriaca to children) till of later years, many phy&s;icians have been fearful of directing them, (arguing from their abu&s;e again&s;t their u&s;e) and e&s;pecially <HI>Harris,</HI> who in other re&s;pects, has written &s;o well on their di&s;ea&s;es. I remember being called to &s;ee an infant of only two days old, who, through a mi&s;take, had taken &s;ome hours before, four drops of laudanum. The parents were greatly alarmed at the child's lying in a &s;tupid, drow&s;y &s;tate, without be|ing able to take the brea&s;t or open its eyes, I encouraged them, however, to believe the laudanum would do no kind of harm, if they would frequently get a little brea&s;t-milk down with a tea-&s;poon. Accordingly, though the child lay &s;leeping above &s;ix and thirty hours, it afterwards awoke perfectly well.&mdash;This is mentioned, however, only by way of encouragement to &s;uch as may be fearful of admini&s;tering opiates even where they are nece&s;&s;ary. They are, neverthele&s;s, very powerful medicines, and &s;hould be pre&s;crib|ed with due caution for patients of every age, and e&s;pecially for infants. A like cau|tion may be nece&s;&s;ary in regard to cordials, which are, neverthele&s;s, in many ca&s;es equal|ly proper, notwith&s;tanding a modern preju|dice again&s;t them. There is a certain cold|ne&s;s and langour in infants when they are ill, e&s;pecially under &s;ome bowel complaints;
<PB N="80" REF="026291_0097_0FCFA989F0EBC9D8">
and whenever they may be in that &s;tate, that cla&s;s of medicines will have a very hap|py effect.</P>
<P>Purging in children, it is to be ob&s;erved, is not always a di&s;ea&s;e. The bowels are the great natural, and critical outlet in infants, as the pores of the &s;kin, and the kidneys are in adults. Not the mere di&s;charge, there|fore, but the cau&s;e of it is, in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, to be removed, and the ill effects are to be guarded again&s;t by keeping the purg|ing within bounds. For this purpo&s;e, the chalk julep, as it is an a&s;tringent only by ab&s;orbing the acrid, or changing the acid, and irritating matter, is as &s;afe as it is u&s;eful, becomes an excellent anodyne, or com|po&s;ing medicine, and after the bowels have been well clea&s;ed, will u&s;ually accompli&s;h the cure.</P>
<P>Dr. Arm&s;trong takes occa&s;ion to &s;peak again&s;t the u&s;e of ab&s;orbent powders, and prefers wine of antimony, becau&s;e modern writers appear to depend &s;o much on the former, from their known property of cor|recting acidity, previous to the exhibition of purges; and &s;ays, that in ca&s;es of extreme danger, a phy&s;ician who is called in late, would, according to this practice, often find no opportunity for purging at all. But &s;ure|ly this is &s;carcely an argument to prove the &s;uperiority of his method, &s;ince no writer that I know of, ever de&s;igned it as a rule
<PB N="81" REF="026291_0098_0FCF8B255EE4A160">
without exception; and <HI>Harris,</HI> who has &s;aid as much as any man in commendation of the ab&s;orbent powders, does not deny the expediency of &s;ometimes beginning with purgative medicines. But had it been otherwi&s;e, the argument goes no farther than to prove, that in ca&s;es of great danger, the wine of antimony, being both an emetic and a purge, ought to precede the u&s;e of the te&s;taceous powders. In&s;tead of this, Dr <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> &s;lides into a general conclu&s;ion from premi&s;es evidently limited; though he has advanced nothing again&s;t an e&s;tabli&s;hed, and &s;ucce&s;sful method of treatment. And I may add, that whil&s;t he is fearful, that the ab&s;orbent powders, (which nobody pre|&s;cribes without &s;ome purging medicines) &s;hould check the loo&s;ene&s;s, and thereby in|crea&s;e the fever; he ventures, after a repe|tition of the antimony, to admini&s;ter what he calls a gentle paregoric, or opiate, to ap|pea&s;e the pain, con&s;i&s;ting of a dram of &s;yrup of white poppies, repeated every three or four hours, till that end be obtained. So that if the pain &s;hould continue for nine hours, a child will take half an ounce of the &s;yrup; and this Dr. <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> ob&s;erves is the only medicine he gives, except wine of antimony, which (notwith&s;tanding the opi|ate) he &s;uppo&s;es to be the efficient remedy.</P>
<P>It is an improper exhibition of ab&s;orb|ents, I apprehend, rather than their do&s;e,
<PB N="82" REF="026291_0099_0FCF8927680BFBD0">
that has made &s;ome practitioners &s;o aver&s;e to them; for they certainly ought, in many ca&s;es, to be given in large quantities; but if admini&s;tered too early, and long continu|ed, the &s;tools may become like plai&s;ter of <HI>Paris,</HI> and be with difficulty excreted. Such an in&s;tance is mentioned by Boerhaave, who had, neverthele&s;s, a very favorable opinion of them, as will be noticed hereafter. There is, however, &s;ome fallacy in regard to the colour of the &s;tools, as this kind is fre|quently ob&s;erved in children who have ne|ver taken any of the te&s;tacea, if the &s;ecre|tion of the bile be ob&s;tructed; as in jaun|diced adults.</P>
<P>In his &s;econd edition, Dr. Arm&s;trong mentions another method he has fallen upon for curing this di&s;order, which, however, appears to be recurring to the ancient method of treating bowel com|plaints, and &s;eems, indeed, to overturn the idea he had entertained of the &s;uperiority of wine of antimony over every other medi|cine. This method, he tells us, is by clean&s;|ing the bowels, by means of proper purga|tives, joined with anodynes, or opiates, in|termixed in &s;uch a manner as to correct the griping quality of the medicines, and le&s;&s;en the &s;timulus occa&s;ioned by the acrimony of the &s;tools.&mdash;A plan worthy of imitation, it is apprehended, and though not likely to
<PB N="83" REF="026291_0100_0FCFA536C1A77640">
be proper in all ca&s;es, mu&s;t, as an occa&s;i|onal practice, be &s;afe and beneficial.</P>
<P>To return, it is of &s;ome con&s;equence to learn what part of the bowels is particular|ly affected, and the degree of pain children may endure; and &s;ome indication may be had from undre&s;&s;ing the child, and careful|ly examining the belly, and gently pre&s;&s;ing in different parts, as well as from the dif|ferent expre&s;&s;ions of pain the infant may manife&s;t, either by a forcible contraction of one or both legs, or of the arms, accord|ing as the irritating matter may be higher or lower, or on one, or both &s;ides of the belly; al&s;o from the coldne&s;s of the feet. Regard is al&s;o to be paid to the kind of &s;tools that come away, which in a diarr|hoea are &s;eldom good, and are u&s;ually di&s;tin|gui&s;hed into the &s;our and curdled, &s;limy, green, clayey, watery, and bloody, &s;ome of which are at times al&s;o fetid; and in this ca&s;e, &s;ome powerful purgative, &s;uch as &s;en|na-tea, is oftentimes nece&s;&s;ary, if the child is not very young. True bloody &s;tools, however, are le&s;s common in infants than adult<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and &s;eldom occur but in the la&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e; but a few &s;treaks of blood may &s;ometimes be mixed with the fe|ces, which ari&s;ing only from the <HI>hemorrhoi|dal</HI> veins, is of no con&s;equence. Should purgings return frequently, it will be very u&s;eful, (e&s;pecially in the time of teething,
<PB N="84" REF="026291_0101_0FCFA534B3527168">
or upon the &s;triking in of &s;ome cutaneou eruption), to procure a little di&s;charge be|hind the ears, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o apply a burgundy-pitch plai&s;ter to the back.

<P>When the &s;tools appear &s;our or curdled, or the child is much di&s;po&s;ed to hiccough, the magne&s;ia, and other ab&s;orbent powders are calculated to afford peculiar a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and may be warmed by the addition of a little grated nutmeg. When the &s;tools are green, or white and clayey, a drop or two of water of kali may be occa&s;ionally put in|to the other medicines, or a little &s;oap be di&s;&s;olved in the cly&s;ters, which are e&s;&s;enti|ally nece&s;&s;ary when much griping attends this complaint: the child's belly may like|wi&s;e be rubbed with a little warm brandy. The following preparation is highly extoll|ed by Boerhaave,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Epi&s;t.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ma.&mdash;ad. J. B.

medicine in the di&s;ea&s;es of infants; and is certainly a good remedy, e&s;pecially in their bowel complaints:</P>
<P>Take of <HI>Venice</HI> &s;oap two drams; prepar|ed pearls, one dram; prepared crabs claws, one dram and an half; &s;yrup of mar&s;hmal|lows, half an ounce; mint-water and fennel-water, of each three ounces; mix them.&mdash;A de&s;ert &s;poonful is directed to be taken once in eight hours.</P>
<P>When purgings have continued a long time without any amendment, a peculiar tightne&s;s of the &s;kin will &s;ometimes take place in the la&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, afford|ing always an unfavourable progno&s;tic; and of which farther notice will be taken under the article of <HI>Skin-bound.</HI></P>
<P>The true <HI>Watery-gripes,</HI> &s;o called, is e&s;|teemed the mo&s;t dangerous of all purgings, and is u&s;ually thought fatal, though perhaps without rea&s;on; &s;ince if properly treated, children recover from it as well as from ex|ce&s;&s;ive purgings of any other kind, unle&s;s it happen after &s;ome other illne&s;s, or to ve|ry &s;mall and tender infants during the month. It is not the having a few very thin &s;tools, however, that is an evidence of the true watery-gripes, for in almo&s;t every purging of a few days continuance, the &s;tools are very thin as well as numerous. But in this ca&s;e, they are thin very early in the di&s;ea&s;e; the child looks wretchedly, and every thing
<PB N="86" REF="026291_0103_0FCFA52F098341C8">
it takes runs almo&s;t immediately through it, with very little change, as in the <HI>lientery</HI> of adults.</P>
<P>The cure &s;hould be begun by admini&s;ter|ing one or more pukes, e&s;pecially when the &s;tools are of a dark colour and fetid, as they frequently are in the earlier periods of the complaint. And to this end, a pretty &s;trong one &s;hould be prepared, which &s;hould be given in divided do&s;es, at about a quarter of an hour's di&s;tance, till a proper effect is produced; and &s;ome hours afterwards a warm purge with rhubarb &s;hould be admi|ni&s;tered, if the di&s;ea&s;e be not very far ad|vanced. After the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages have been cleared, the eighth part of a grain, or le&s;s, of ipecacuanha, or a drop or two of wine of antimony, given every three or four hours, with a few grains of the te&s;taceous powders, or the aromatic confection, appear to me among&s;t the be&s;t remedies in the ear|lier periods of the complaint. Indeed, ve|ry &s;mall do&s;es of ipecacuanha, e&s;pecially if duly guarded by &s;ome gentle aromatic, is both &s;o u&s;eful and &s;afe a remedy, that it &s;hould not be ha&s;tily laid a&s;ide, and when per&s;evered in the u&s;e of for &s;ome time, will effect wonders, not only in long purgings, but in other chronical complaints.</P>
<P>In the more advanced &s;tages of the watery-gripes, and where the child is not very young, the following old medicine is a ve|ry
<PB N="87" REF="026291_0104_0FCFA52D513A6298">
good one&mdash;Of <HI>Locatelli's</HI> bal&s;am, one ounce, and con&s;erve of red ro&s;es, two ounces: from the quantity of an hor&s;e-bean to that of nutmeg, may be given three or four times a day, according to the age of the child.&mdash;The laudanum plai&s;ter likewi&s;e, as directed for vomitings, or the following, may be applied to the parts above the navel: Take of Venice treacle, one ounce; ex|pre&s;&s;ed oil of mace, two drams; and oil of nutmegs, three drops; mix them into a plai&s;ter, to be &s;pread on a piece of &s;oft lea|ther.</P>
<P>Should the&s;e means fail, I have known the repetition of a vomit give an immediate check to the complaint, e&s;pecially where the &s;tools continue to be remarkably &s;our. So long as this is the ca&s;e, it would be both vain and hazardous to exhibit opiates, or powerful re&s;tringents: the acidity mu&s;t be fir&s;t carried off by warm purges, and be corrected by ab&s;orbents; the latter of which mu&s;t be given in large, and repeated do&s;es, and frequently their powers be augmented by the addition of water of kali, or tincture of myrrhe. And an excellent remedy &s;ome|times, as an antiacid, is the <HI>&s;pir. &s;alis am|mon. &s;uccinat.</HI> of <HI>Bate's</HI> di&s;pen&s;atory. The acidity once removed, a &s;tarch cly&s;ter may be thrown up, two or three times a day, with or without a few drops of laudanum, according to the number of the &s;tools, and
<PB N="88" REF="026291_0105_0FCFA52BA1EEFB30">
weakne&s;s of the infant. A drop or two of laudanum may now likewi&s;e be given, once or more in the day, (according to the age of the child) either joined with &s;ome pur|gative, or in any of the afore-mentioned medicines, or in the chalk-julep, made warm with tincture of cinnamon, or of cardamoms; and in ca&s;es of extremity, in the decoction of log-wood, which agrees very well with young children.</P>
<P>If infants ill of watery-gripes, are brought up by hand, the &s;tricte&s;t attention mu&s;t be paid to their food, which mu&s;t be changed from one kind to another, and e&s;pecially trial be made of broths, (and to older chil|dren white meats) as long as the food &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to turn very acid on the &s;to|mach. In one ca&s;e, I think I &s;aved a child, by <HI>Bates's julepum vitae,</HI> lowered with wa|ter, when nothing el&s;e would &s;tay on the &s;tomach. This &s;erved both for food and medicine; for the former of which, it was &s;till farther diluted. When the watery-gripes, or indeed any violent purging, at|tacks young children at the brea&s;t, no other food ought to be given, but the wet nur&s;e be changed, if the acidity and purging con|tinue many days, and medicine does not &s;eem to take a proper effect; which it cannot, if any offen&s;ive matter be continually thrown into the &s;tomach.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="026291_0106_0FCFA52A1B734C48">
It has already been hinted, that when there is no fever, purging medicines for children ought to be made potentially warm, and in no ca&s;e is it more nece&s;&s;ary, than in long continued complaints of the bowels, which are &s;o apt to give ri&s;e to &s;pa&s;modic affections. I am not very fond of giving pre&s;criptions, but it may not here be alto|gether ami&s;s for &s;ome readers, &s;ince the fol|lowing, con&s;idered as a general medicine, has been found &s;o frequently u&s;eful, and will keep for a great length of time.</P>
<P>Take of rhubarb from fifteen to twenty grains; two &s;cruples of magne&s;ia alba; &s;weet fennel, and dill-waters, of each one ounce; half an ounce, or &s;ix drams of &s;yrup of ro&s;es, and fifteen or twenty drops of the compound &s;pirit of ammonia. Of this, one, two, or three tea-&s;poonsful may be given two or three times a day, and being very plea|&s;ant, infants are never aver&s;e to it.</P>
<P>Bowel complaints, it was &s;aid, are fre|quently owing to improper food, which on this account, &s;hould at all times be peculiar|ly attended to; and when a purging has taken place, ought to be &s;uited to the na|ture of the &s;tools. In the &s;econd part of this work, &s;ome farther notice will be taken of the article of children's food; at pre&s;ent, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that cow's milk is often found to di&s;agree with them, when their bowels are di&s;po&s;ed to be too open, at which
<PB N="90" REF="026291_0107_0FCFA528930C3498">
times, a little lean mutton broth, or beef-tea is abundantly preferable. On the &s;ame account, ru&s;ks,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are preferable to tops and bottoms, as they are called, which have a good deal of butter in them.</NOTE> and bi&s;cuit-powder are more &s;uitable than bread; but at other times, I believe, either the common, or the <HI>French</HI> roll, which is already half dige&s;ted by a previous fermentation, is more ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved in the &s;tomach, if there be not a predominant acid in the fir&s;t-pa&s;&s;ages. But where there is an habitual di&s;po&s;ition to a purging, I know of no diet &s;o proper for in|fants who do not &s;uck, or who cannot have enough of the brea&s;t, as flour baked a long time in the oven, till it breaks into a &s;oft, greyi&s;h-coloured powder,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">To this end, the flour &s;hould be put into a &s;mall jar, properly covered, and be taken out of the oven &s;everal times, and &s;tirred up from the bottom and &s;ides of the jar, that it may not form into hard lumps, but the whole be equally baked.</NOTE> and afterwards mixed with boiled cow's milk, the &s;cum be|ing fir&s;t taken off; the flour and milk &s;hould then be boiled a little time together, till the whole appears like a thin cu&s;tard. This is a very light and &s;oft food, and &s;ufficiently re|&s;tringent; and I have often known more good from it, than from all the ab&s;orbent medicines ever devi&s;ed, and have received more thanks for the pre&s;cription, as it proves a permanent remedy. When children who
<PB N="91" REF="026291_0108_0FCFA52724000C98">
are weaned, are attacked with repeated purgings, and even broth is found to run through them, I have ob&s;erved no food &s;o generally u&s;eful as a bit of the white of chicken, not over-boiled, and afterwards lightly brui&s;ed in a mortar with the chicken liquor, and a very little bread, into a kind of light jelly. But this &s;hould not be given oftener than twice, or at mo&s;t, three times a day.</P>
<P>In all bowel complaints, it has been al|ready remarked, that infants are di&s;po&s;ed to eruptions on the &s;kin; by which they are &s;o frequently benefited, that if any kind of ra&s;h appears during long or &s;evere purgings, a recovery may almo&s;t with certainly be progno&s;ticated.</P>
<P>That I may not multiply di&s;tinct heads of complaint where little need to be &s;aid, I &s;hall briefly notice in this place, that many children who are accu&s;tomed at all times to have a very open belly, do not &s;eem to have the faculty of properly retaining their &s;tools, and need a &s;ervant continually to attend them, even at two or three years of age; &s;o that &s;ome have been &s;u&s;pected of being culpable in the matter. I know of no par|ticular remedy, indeed, on this occa&s;ion, but, perhaps, the <HI>aqua calcis,</HI> and other ab&s;orbents may have been of &s;ome u&s;e; I have, however, ob&s;erved, that the com|plaint

The Symptoms of worms are various, and many of them are very equivocal: I &s;hall name only the more con&s;tant, and le&s;s un|certain ones. Such are fetid breath, e&s;pe|cially in the morning; bad gums; itching of the no&s;e, and of the anus, e&s;pecially from the <HI>a&s;carides;</HI> a very irregular appetite, al|ways in extremes, whether of hunger or of loathing; a large, hard belly; pains at the &s;tomach; &s;ometimes vomiting, oftener co&s;|tivene&s;s or purging, with &s;limy &s;tools; ir|regular colicks; thir&s;t; dulne&s;s; peculiar unhealthy and bloated countenance, with a dark, hollow circle round the eyes; &s;tart|ings in the &s;leep, and grinding of the teeth. To the&s;e &s;ymptoms are often added, &s;low fever, with a &s;mall and irregular pul&s;e, pale, or whiti&s;h urine, a &s;hort and dry cough, (which is an almo&s;t con&s;tant &s;ymptom where the complaint is of long &s;tanding, and has injured the health;) &s;ometimes even con|vul&s;ions, epilep&s;ies, and partial pal&s;ies of the lower extremities.

The Cau&s;e of this trouble&s;ome complaint is not perhaps certainly known&punc; but the great moi&s;ture of young per&s;ons is thought to be an occa&s;ion of their being more infe&s;t|ed with them than older people. Since the doctrine of equivocal generation has been ju&s;tly exploded, it has been generally ima|gined, that worms are engendered from the eggs of in&s;ects, which float in the air, or are &s;wallowed with &s;ome part of our food, &s;uch as &s;ummer fruits, vegetables, chee&s;e, and &s;ome kinds of fle&s;h meats.

<HEAD>CONVULSIONS.</HEAD>
<P>CONVULSIONS are of two kinds; the <HI>&s;ymptomatic,</HI> depending upon another di&s;ea&s;e, and the <HI>idiopathic,</HI> &s;aid to be an original complaint, and ari&s;ing from a mor|bid affection of the brain, though the di&s;|tinction be not, perhaps, perfectly philo&s;o|phical, or accurate. It is for want of &s;ome &s;uch di&s;crimination, however, that writers have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that children
<PB N="100" REF="026291_0117_0FCFA513BAA00E80">
are much oftener &s;uppo&s;ed to die of con|vul&s;ions than they really do; for though a convul&s;ion frequently clo&s;es the &s;cene, it has generally ari&s;en from the great irritabi|ity of their nerves, and violence of the di&s;ea&s;e under which they have laboured.</P>
<P>Such original Cau&s;e may be a ra&s;h impro|perly repelled; but is much oftener &s;eated in the gums, in the time of teething; or in the fir&s;t-pa&s;&s;ages, where &s;ome undige&s;ted mat|ter, or &s;ometimes pent-up wind, irritates the coates of the inte&s;tines, and produces irre|gular motions throughout the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem. Such a load, whether from too great a quantity, or bad quality of the food, by occa&s;ioning a faulty &s;ecretion, mu&s;t act like a poi&s;on; and that the convul&s;ions are ow|ing to this cau&s;e may often be known by the complaints that have preceded them, &s;uch as loathings, co&s;tivene&s;s, purging, pale countenance, large belly, and di&s;turbed &s;leep. If the child is two or three years old, any load at the &s;tomach may be more readily di&s;covered; the tongue will be foul, the &s;kin hot, and the pul&s;e quick and weak. But &s;hould it be granted, that the convul&s;i|ons of children are generally &s;ymptomatic, they may neverthele&s;s be &s;aid to die of them more frequently than &s;ome authors have al|lowed; for where a di&s;ea&s;e is di&s;po&s;ed to produce violent convul&s;ions, the convul&s;ion, though a mere &s;ymptom, may carry off the
<PB N="101" REF="026291_0118_0FCFA512515A13E0">
patient: but as it may &s;ometimes be pre|vented or removed, by its peculiar reme|dies, (the di&s;ea&s;e which occa&s;ioned it being at the &s;ame time properly treated) infants may often be recovered, who would other|wi&s;e expire in a convul&s;ion fit.</P>
<P>Any little matter capable of irritating the nervous &s;y&s;tem, will induce the &s;ymptoma|tic convul&s;ions in &s;ome infants, whil&s;t others will with&s;tand a great deal. For &s;uch ha|bits as the former, the cold bath will be found the be&s;t pre&s;ervative. Every young infant is, however, more or le&s;s, predi&s;po&s;|ed to this complaint; and the di&s;po&s;ition continues throughout childhood, in a pro|portion to the age and delicacy of the ha|bit. The younger and more irritable, therefore, an infant may be, it will be &s;o much the more liable to the &s;ymptomatic convul&s;ion, e&s;pecially from any con&s;iderable di&s;turbance in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, as was men|tioned before, particularly the bad quality, or over thickne&s;s of the brea&s;t-milk, or other food; and from frights of the wet nur&s;e. Of this I remember a remarkable in&s;tance in a patient of my own, in who&s;e hou&s;e a vi&s;iter dropped down &s;uddenly dead. The mother of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> child, which was &s;ix months old, was exceedingly alarmed, but her at|tention being for a moment called off by its crying, &s;he incautiou&s;ly put it to her brea&s;t.

was &s;eized with a &s;it, and lay either convul&s;ed or drow&s;y, without &s;o much as taking the brea&s;t, for the &s;pace of &s;ix and thirty hours; though it was at length hap|pily recovered.</P>
<P>The cure of every convul&s;ion will con&s;i&s;t, principally, in removing the exciting cau&s;es, which mu&s;t, therefore, be inquired into.

If the ir|ritation be in the bowels, whatever will car|ry down their acrid contents will cure the convul&s;ions, if admini&s;tered in time; and we ought generally to begin with a cly&s;ter. If the &s;tools appear very foul after common purges, (in which ca&s;e there will frequently be a difficulty of breathing) a few grains of the powder of &s;cammony with calomel may be given with great propriety. But if the di&s;po&s;ition to convul&s;ions continues, after the bowels have been properly clean&s;ed, and no new irritation of them may be appre|hended, anti&s;pa&s;modics &s;hould be admini&s;|tered,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;peak from my own experience of the efficacy of &s;uch remedies, and it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve that Harris, who is extremely cautions of giving heating medicines to infants, &s;peaks favourably of &s;ome of the&s;e.&mdash;"U&s;us horum (&s;ays he) hand pror|&s;us improbandus e&s;t, vel in tenellis: nempe quia aci|dum ab&s;orbendi facultate excellunt.

If from teething, af|ter gentle evacuations, and other means di|rected under that head, bli&s;ters, oil of rue, laudanum, or the compound &s;pirit of vitri|olic aether, and e&s;pecially lancing the gums, are the grand remedies.</P>

At other times, the appearance of &s;ome other complaint has put an end to the convul&s;ions, and not un|frequently, changing the wet-nur&s;e; and &s;ometimes even weaning children, when &s;ix or eight months old, has &s;eemed to remove the complaint.

The infant previous to this, for &s;everal months together as con&s;tantly fell in|to violent convul&s;ions as it chanced to chew a cru&s;t of bread, eat a bit of plain pudding, or even take bread and milk, and though

when debarred from the&s;e, and nouri&s;hed only at the brea&s;t of a healthy nur&s;e, the fits recurred every two or three weeks: but after going through the &s;mall-pox in a fa|vourable manner, and being taken wholly from the brea&s;t, the fits &s;oon di&s;appeared, and the child was able to take all the light food u&s;ually given to infants.</P>
<P>If convul&s;ions come on without any of the preceding &s;ymptoms, they have gene|rally been concluded to be a primary di&s;|ea&s;e, and to proceed immediately from the brain. Some derivation is therefore to be made, by bleeding, if the child &s;eems able to bear it, or by leeches behind the ears; by bli&s;ters; purging; bathing the feet in warm water; frictions of the legs, and rub|bing the &s;oles of the feet with the water of ammonia. If children of two or three years old are &s;ubject to &s;light and frequent fits, i&s;&s;ues or &s;etons &s;hould be made between the &s;houlders, or in the neck, and be kept open for a length of time: chalybeate wa|ters may likewi&s;e be u&s;eful.

But when an in|fant falls &s;uddenly into a convul&s;ion very &s;oon after &s;ucking, or feeding, whether on any thing actually improper, or not, and the bowels have been for &s;ome days in an orderly &s;tate, it may rea&s;onably be pre&s;um|ed, that the irritation is in the &s;tomach, e&s;|pecially if there be an unu&s;ual palene&s;s of the countenance, indicating &s;ickne&s;s; or on the contrary, any con&s;iderable blackne&s;s, with &s;ymptoms of &s;uffocation; which I think do not come on &s;o &s;oon when the ob&s;truction is in the bowels. And it &s;hould here be re|marked, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary, that the load in the &s;tomach &s;hould be con&s;iderable in quantity in order to induce &s;uch &s;udden and alarming convul&s;ions; it is &s;ufficient that the &s;tomach be really oppre&s;&s;ed by it to a certain degree; nor does i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> always appear to ari&s;e &s;o much from an oppre&s;&s;ive abun|dance, as from a &s;mall piece of undige&s;ted

food, irritating, and perhaps &s;ticking in the <HI>pylorus,</HI> or inferior aperture of the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e here de&s;cribed it would be improper to think of a formal emetic, at lea&s;t without making trial of &s;ome more ex|peditious means, &s;uch as irritating the <HI>Pharynx,</HI> or upper part of the guller, with the finger, or a feather, or forcing in the &s;moke of tobacco, if that be at hand, which often in&s;tantly produce vomit|ing, and put an end to the fit. To this end, the child &s;hould be &s;upported by a hand placed under its &s;tomach and belly, whil&s;t the feather or other means are made u&s;e of; in which po&s;ture the infant will be made to vomit more readily, and with le&s;s &s;training, than in any other po&s;ition.&mdash;It is hoped that the importance of the &s;ubject, as well as the very frequent &s;ucce&s;s attend|ing the plans la&s;t recommended, under the mo&s;t alarming appearances, may be thought an apology for the length of this chapter, as well as the &s;ort of repetitions made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>It is farther to be noted, that &s;ymptoma|tic convul&s;ions are &s;ometimes the effect of a &s;alutary effort of nature, to produce a cri&s;is in &s;ome di&s;ea&s;e the child labours under; in which ca&s;e, great caution &s;hould be u&s;ed not to be over officious: bathing the feet in warm water, however, as mentioned before,
<PB N="110" REF="026291_0127_0FCFA501D25D3BA0">
will be perfectly &s;afe, and perhaps u&s;eful.&mdash;Having &s;poken of opiates, I &s;hall ju&s;t ob|&s;erve, that though they are often very &s;er|viceable, when judiciou&s;ly pre&s;cribed, they become very hurtful if improperly admini|&s;tered. They will, however, always be &s;afe, where convul&s;ions continue after the fir&s;t exciting cau&s;e has been removed; or where they are &s;o violent as to become an ob&s;tacle to admini&s;tering proper remedies; or when the originial complaint is of a &s;pa&s;modic nature.</P>
<P>When convul&s;ions occur many times in a day, it is of importance to attend to the di&s;|tance of the paroxy&s;ms, or returns; from which a much better indication may be had of their immediate danger, than from the forcible contraction of the mu&s;cles during the fit. For where the intervals are &s;hort, though the fit it&s;elf be not long, nor vio|lent, the di&s;ea&s;e is more dangerous, than where violent fits are attended with long intervals.</P>

<P>IN the preceding edition, this di&s;order was con&s;idered only in a tran&s;ient way, under the article of <HI>Purging;</HI> both from its being conceived to appear chiefly in the form of a morbid &s;ymptom attending certain

bowel complaints, and becau&s;e I had then neither &s;een, nor heard enough of the di&s;|ea&s;e to enable me to offer to the public any very di&s;tinct account of it. I could indeed wi&s;h that this di&s;order were yet better un|der&s;tood, and that I were able to lay down a more &s;ucce&s;sful method of treatment than has yet been made known: it is however in every view worthy of the mo&s;t di&s;tinct con&s;ideration, as well from the ob&s;ervations made in this country, as from the late re|&s;earches by &s;everal phy&s;icians in <HI>Paris,</HI> as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to notice very &s;oon.</P>
<P>Having met with no account of this di&s;|order either among&s;t the ancients, nor very modern writers when I mentioned it in a former edition, I pre&s;umed I was announc|ing a di&s;ea&s;e, at that time &s;carcely known, or at lea&s;t was giving the fir&s;t public account of it: and this I believe is no uncommon mi&s;take of authors. Perhaps, it may be the wi&s;e intention of Providence, that in &s;uc|ceeding ages, many things relating to arts and &s;ciences &s;hould be forgotten or over|looked, in order to emulate po&s;terity in the pur&s;uit of knowledge; which men would, probably, be le&s;s inqui&s;itive after, if things once known were very rarely lo&s;t &s;ight of. However this may be, I continued to con|&s;ult the olde&s;t writers, after having publi&s;h|ed my former edition, and was once more led to conclude, that no account of this di&s;|order
<PB N="112" REF="026291_0129_0FCFA4FD2DB7A4D0">
had ever before been given to the public. At length, however, I met with a &s;olitary ca&s;e, which had occurred in the ho&s;|pital at <HI>Stockholm, Anno</HI> 1718, accurately de&s;cribed by <HI>Uzenbe&s;ius,</HI> and recorded <HI>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Scuringii Embrologia (de faetu frigido et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ri|gido),</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The midwife is reported to have &s;aid, that this infant though born alive, felt as inten&s;ely cold and rigid when it came into the world as a piece of ice.&mdash;How this might be, I leave to the Academy of the Curious to determine.</NOTE> but without adverting at all to its treatment. The ca&s;e, as I &s;ince find, is tran&s;cribed into the <HI>Ephemerid. Academ. Naturae Curio&s;or. Cent.</HI> ix.</P>
<P>The above is related in a manner import|ing it to be an uncommon occurrence, and the di&s;ea&s;e at that time little, if at all known: and though recorded in two di&s;tinct works (the latter of which is rather con&s;ulted than regularly peru&s;ed) the ca&s;e &s;eems to have been univer&s;ally overlooked, and con&s;e|quently the true nature of the di&s;ea&s;e has remained nearly in its original ob&s;curity. It was, indeed, not till a twelve-month af|ter my &s;hort account of it appeared, that this di&s;order began to engage the attention of the French phy&s;icians, in con&s;equence of Mon&s;ieur Andry being called upon to take the charge of the <HI>Ho&s;pice des Enf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ns trouv&egrave;s&punc;</HI> at <HI>Paris.</HI> The di&s;ea&s;e indeed had been for many years noticed both in that ho&s;pital
<PB N="113" REF="026291_0130_0FCFA4FAD9A85C00">
and the <HI>h&ocirc;tel Dieu,</HI> but having always prov|ed fatal, little attention had been for a long time paid to it, till Dr. Andry was elected phy&s;ician to the fir&s;t mentioned charity; &s;ince which time, no pains &s;eem to have been &s;pared in the inve&s;tigation of it.</P>
<P>That the pre&s;ent account of the di&s;ea&s;e may therefore be clearly &s;tated, I &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider it as it has appeared in this coun|try, and in the manner I had long ago in|tended, and had actually drawn up before I was favoured with &s;ome farther de&s;cription of it, by Dr. Andry, of Paris.</P>
<P>It has, indeed, been much le&s;s common in this kingdom than on the continent, but is equally an ho&s;pital di&s;ea&s;e, and is &s;eldom met with but accompanied with &s;ome bowel complaint, and &s;till more rarely appearing at the birth. It was fir&s;t &s;poken of in pub|lic, I believe, by my friend Dr. Denman (when phy&s;ician to the Middle&s;ex ho&s;pital, and a teacher in midwifery); as I remarked in the former edition; and it is to him I was indebted for &s;ome account of it before I had at all noticed the di&s;order my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Briti&s;h Lying-in</HI> ho&s;pital has been very little infe&s;ted with it, and, po&s;&s;ibly, by being &s;olely appropriated to the recep|tion of pregnant women, which the <HI>Mid|dle&s;ex</HI> ho&s;pital was not. I &s;hall therefore fir&s;t of all lay down the &s;ymptoms exactly as they were noticed in that infirmary, by
<PB N="114" REF="026291_0131_0FCFA4F9B04B8E50">
Dr. Denman, who&s;e unwearied attention to it, though not with all the de&s;ired effect, does him more honour, than could have been derived from the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful treat|ment of a di&s;ea&s;e le&s;s fatal than this has proved wherever it as appeared.</P>
<P>The following &s;ymptoms may be con&s;i|dered as pathognomonic, or characteri&s;tic of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>1&s;t. The &s;kin is always of a yellowi&s;h white colour, giving the idea of &s;oft wax.</P>
<P>2d. The feel of the &s;kin and fle&s;h is hard and re&s;i&s;ting, but not edemato&s;e.</P>
<P>3d. The cellular membrane is fixed in &s;uch a manner, that the &s;kin will not &s;lide over the &s;ubjacent mu&s;cles; not even on the back of the hands, where it is u&s;ually very loo&s;e and pliable.</P>
<P>4th. This &s;tricture often extends over the whole body; but the &s;kin is peculiarly rigid in the parts about the face, and on the extremities.</P>
<P>5th. The child is always cold.</P>
<P>6th. The infant makes a peculiar kind of moaning noi&s;e, which is often very feeble; and never cries like other chirdren.</P>
<P>7th. Whatever number of days &s;uch children may &s;urvive, they always have the appearance of being dying.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e appears at no regular peri|ods; but whenever it takes place it attacks &s;everal infants within a &s;hort time; and
<PB N="115" REF="026291_0132_0FCF891524192E30">
chiefly tho&s;e, as I have ju&s;t noticed, who may be in the la&s;t &s;tage of ob&s;tinate bowel complaints, in which the &s;tools are of a waxey or clayey con&s;i&s;tence. It has been al&s;o remarked, that it &s;ometimes makes its ap|pearance as an <HI>original</HI> di&s;ea&s;e, and even at the birth; in which ca&s;e, the infant has ne|ver &s;urvived many days.</P>
<P>I have &s;een the rigidity extending beyond the cellular membrane, &s;o as to affect the mu&s;cles, but only tho&s;e of the lower jaw, which became perfectly rigid: but this <HI>&s;pa&s;m</HI> or <HI>tetanus</HI> is, by no means, a frequent &s;ymp|tom, and does not &s;eize the extremities as it is found to do in France; nor has the di&s;|ea&s;e, in any in&s;tance that I have heard of, been attended with the <HI>ery&s;ipelatous</HI> affections con&s;tantly noticed in that country.</P>
<P>The Cau&s;e of this dreadful complaint, when congenite, or evidently &s;upervenient to di&s;orders of the fir&s;t-pa&s;&s;ages, &s;eems to me to be a &s;pa&s;m depending very much upon a certain morbid &s;tate of tho&s;e parts, and with which the &s;kin is well known to have a pe|culiar &s;ympathy. But when, though an original di&s;ea&s;e, it does not take place till &s;ome days after birth, which, I believe, is rarely, if ever the ca&s;e except in large ho&s;pitals, and other crouded apartments; wherever the irritating cau&s;e, in &s;uch in&s;tan|ces, may be &s;eated, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;eems to be an <HI>endemic</HI> of certain &s;ea&s;ons, ari&s;ing from
<PB N="116" REF="026291_0133_0FCFA4F71C75ACD0">
that unwhole&s;ome air to which &s;uch places are peculiarly liable.</P>
<P>The means of Cure in this country have been very different from tho&s;e that have lately been found &s;ucce&s;sful in France; but in&s;tances of recovery have been very few in either. As Dr. Denman did me the kind|ne&s;s of giving me the fir&s;t intimation of &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e, I very naturally adopted his plan of treatment, which con&s;i&s;ted in a &s;trict at|tention to the &s;tate of the bowels; and ren|dering the &s;everal medicines very warm by means of the compound &s;pirit of ammonia, which was admini&s;tered every four or &s;ix hours; and was the only plan that he ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound attended with any &s;ucce&s;s. Together with this, I after &s;ome time directed the fre|quent u&s;e of a warm-bath, and chafing the whole body afterwards with &s;oft flannel; and I think my&s;elf happy in having fallen up|on one part of the plan that has &s;ince ap|peared to have been attended with the fir&s;t in&s;tances of &s;ucce&s;s in France, as will be no|ticed below.</P>
<P>As the di&s;ea&s;e raging &s;o much in <HI>France</HI> &s;eems to differ in many re&s;pects from ours, it is very doubtful how far the plan of cure lately adopted there may be applicable in this country, and my own experience has hitherto not gone beyond the means I la&s;t mentioned: but I would venture to &s;ugge&s;t, that in many ca&s;es, trial might be &s;afely and
<PB N="117" REF="026291_0134_0FCFA4F53AD16750">
properly made, not only of carminative cly&s;ters, but al&s;o of a grain of calomel pre|vious to the infant being put into the warm-bath:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the warm water &s;hould be added a good quantity of &s;alt, and &s;ome Ca&s;tile &s;oap.</NOTE> and after a &s;ufficient number of &s;tools &s;hall have been procured by the&s;e means, exhibiting other volatile and cordial remedies be&s;ide the &s;pirit of ammonia; as well as anti-&s;pa&s;modics of different kinds.</P>
<P>It was after I had made up my mind about this complaint, in the manner that has been ju&s;t noticed, that an adverti&s;ement appeared from the Royal Society of Medicine in <HI>Paris,</HI> propo&s;ing this di&s;ea&s;e as the &s;ubject for their next prize-medal. About this time al&s;o, Mr. TENON publi&s;hed his <HI>M&egrave;moires &s;ur les H&ocirc;pitaux de Paris,</HI> in which is a brief ac|count of this di&s;ea&s;e; and very &s;oon after this, Dr. Andry did me the honour of &s;end|ing me his Tract, intitled, <HI>Recherches &s;ur L'endurci&s;&s;ement du Ti&s;&s;u cellulaire des En|fans noveaux-n&egrave;s.</HI></P>
<P>Though the&s;e works contain very accu|rate accounts of this di&s;ea&s;e, and to which Dr. Andry e&s;pecially has paid an attention that mu&s;t do him great honour, they at fir&s;t &s;erved only to perplex my own views of it. This ob&s;curity aro&s;e from the di&s;order be|ing combined, or as I then rather conceiv|ed,
<PB N="118" REF="026291_0135_0FCFA4ED51CDB188">
intirely confounded with another com|plaint fir&s;t publickly noticed, I believe, in a former edition of this work, under the term <HI>anomalous inflammation;</HI> and from which Dr. Andry had, on this occa&s;ion, made two or three quotations. I therefore took the liberty of writing to that eminent phy&s;ician, and was &s;oon favoured with a &s;a|tisfactory an&s;wer, by which I hope the pub|lic as well as my&s;elf may be obliged; as it mu&s;t prevent any mi&s;takes ari&s;ing from the accounts which the above mentioned works afford of this melancholy di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>After the de&s;cription given of this di&s;or|der as it appears in <HI>London,</HI> little more will be nece&s;&s;ary, I apprehend, than to &s;elect the circum&s;tances in which <HI>that</HI> in <HI>France</HI> is found to differ, as related by Dr. Andry in his printed work, as well as the letters with which he was plea&s;ed to honour me.</P>
<P>It has already been &s;aid, that it is more frequently attended with <HI>tetanus,</HI> and never occurs without tho&s;e appearances mention|ed under the article, termed in this edition, <HI>Infantile Ery&s;ipelas,</HI> e&s;pecially the redne&s;s and hardne&s;s about the <HI>pubes,</HI> accompanied farther with tumour and redne&s;s of the &s;oles of the feet.

<PB N="119" REF="026291_0136_0FCF890FD75D6E18">
In one very late in&s;tance, however, the in|fant was not cold, but on the contrary, ex|ceedingly hot. The legs, thighs, and &s;oles of the feet were red and hard; but no men|tion being made of a <HI>general</HI> tightne&s;s of the &s;kin, it is probable this child was affected only with that infantile ery&s;ipelas which ap|pears among&s;t us.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above variations, the infants are &s;aid to &s;wallow with extreme pain; the extremities, e&s;pecially the legs, are much enlarged, and attended with a &s;erous effu|&s;ion in the cellular membrane, which we have not hitherto noticed: and the di&s;order is likewi&s;e &s;aid to rage mo&s;t in the hotter months.&mdash;The infants are ob&s;erved to die about the third or fourth day, or at farthe&s;t, on the &s;eventh from the birth.

<PB N="120" REF="026291_0137_0FCFA4EC85D13260">
But in the in&s;tance recorded by Scuringius it was clearly otherwi&s;e, the infant being &s;aid to feel, from head to foot, like a piece of fle&s;h dried in the &s;moke. The child &s;urviv|ed a compleat day, during which time it took no &s;ort of nouri&s;hment; but never cried, nor made any kind of noi&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon examining a great number of dead bodies at the <HI>Enfans Trouv&egrave;s,</HI> the &s;erous extrava&s;ation is con&s;tantly met with; is of a deep yellow colour and fluid, but coagu|lates with heat; the fat is peculiarly &s;olid; the glands and lymphatics, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the me&s;entery, are found &s;tuffed, and the liver uncommonly large, with a great quantity of deep coloured bile in the gall|bladder; and the lungs are &s;aid to be load|ed with blood, as well as to contain an unu|&s;ual quantity of air.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ed Cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e among&s;t them, &s;eems to me but ill accounted for; being attributed to the improper diet of the mother or her infant, or to cold it has taken at the birth: whereas, the coldne&s;s and ri|gidity of the &s;kin &s;eem to be but mere &s;ymp|toms, and not the di&s;ea&s;e; e&s;pecially as their children, like ours, are but rarely attacked from the birth.

It &s;eems &s;ome|what to differ, therefore, from the di&s;ea&s;e termed <HI>Jaw-fallen,</HI> in the We&s;t Indies; and in one in&s;tance appeared to have &s;ome re|&s;emblance to the <HI>catalep&s;y.</HI> The rigidity has &s;tolen on in a more gradual way in &s;ome in|&s;tances than in others, but has always been very great as far as it extended, from the moment it has been di&s;covered; &s;o that in in&s;tances where the mouth has continued &s;ufficiently open to admit my finger, I could not thereby depre&s;s the jaw. In &s;ome, the eyes have been bloated, and the whole countenance much &s;wollen.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of this complaint, which does not &s;eem to ari&s;e from con&s;tipation, or ne|glect of purging off the meconium, may, probably, be a certain &s;tate of the air, as hath al&s;o been &s;u&s;pected in the We&s;t Indies; and the more &s;o, as the di&s;ea&s;e has appear|ed only once in the Briti&s;h Lying-in Ho&s;pital
<PB N="124" REF="026291_0141_0FCF890D283A3F90">
during a great number of years and then attacked &s;everal infants in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>The remedies made u&s;e of at the ho&s;pi|tal were, the warm-bath; fomentations to the rigid parts, frictions with oil and cam|phire, and BATES's anodyne bal&s;am; bli&s;|ters behind the ears, and to the nape of the neck; and opium, calomel, the bark, and aromatic confection have been given inter|nally.</P>
<P>One infant, in whom the complaint was confined to the jaw, and who had le&s;s rigi|dity than any of the others; never looked ill, and had no convul&s;ions in its limbs, died rather &s;ooner than the re&s;t. Only one &s;ur|vived the third day: this child was not &s;eized till the ninth from its birth, and lived to go out of the ho&s;pital with its mother, at the end of the third week, and we hoped was then recovering; but it had never been able to take the brea&s;t after the attack, and died three weeks after it left the ho&s;pital, though, po&s;&s;ibly, not altogether from this complaint.</P>

<P>Very few words, however, on the Epilep|&s;y, or falling-&s;ickne&s;s, may &s;uffice, as it is either pretty ea&s;ily cured, or u&s;ually conti|nues through life; and is too well known by this popular name to require a particular de&s;cription: an account of the various pre|current &s;ymptoms would be equally u&s;ele&s;s in this work.&mdash;It may ju&s;t be noticed, that the patient falls &s;uddenly to the ground, and &s;ometimes without any perceptible warning, or at all &s;ufficient to &s;ecure him from injury; and is u&s;ually much convul&s;ed, but frequent|ly retains his &s;en&s;es during the fit.</P>
<P>I believe it &s;ometimes takes its ri&s;e merely from foul bowels, and certainly more com|monly attacks children of a co&s;tive habit of body: it &s;hould then be treated agreeably to the directions already given in &s;uch ca&s;es, and e&s;pecially with active and mercurial purges: after which, the bark, chalybeates, and &s;ea-bathing may be &s;erviceable.

<P>In the wor&s;t ca&s;es I ever met with, in which the fits were very long and violent, and to the number of twenty or thirty in a day, electricity has very &s;oon rendered them weaker, reduced their number to three or four in a day, and gradually to one in a month; but did not entirely remove them. In &s;uch ob&s;tinate ca&s;es it is generally &s;up|po&s;ed, that the brain is affected by &s;ome local and permanent cau&s;e, and a perfect cure is con&s;equently de&s;paired of.</P>
<P>When this di&s;ea&s;e has attacked children of five or &s;ix years of age, and where no treatment has been &s;erviceable, the com|plaint has very frequently di&s;appeared &s;ud|denly about the time of puberty, and &s;ome|times a year or two &s;ooner.

<HEAD>TEETHING.</HEAD>
<P>THE complaints ari&s;ing during dentition may next be con&s;idered, many of the foregoing being blended with it, the fir&s;t-pa&s;&s;ages and the nervous &s;y&s;tem being al|ways more or le&s;s affected. The &s;tate of dentition is likewi&s;e not unfrequently an oc|ca&s;ion of many complaints afterwards to be mentioned, &s;uch as cough, fever, the rick|ets, and even con&s;umption; under each of which heads therefore, occa&s;ional references will be made to it.</P>
<P>The time of teething is a mo&s;t important period of the infant &s;tate, and &s;ubjects into manifold complaints and dangers. Some writers, indeed, and particularly Dr. Cado|gan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Nur&s;ing,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>, and Dr. Arm&s;trong, &s;eem to think otherwi&s;e; and that teething is &s;carcely to be ranked among&s;t the di&s;ea&s;es of infants. They have imagined that children, if other|wi&s;e healthy, would cut their teeth with no more danger than adults, who often out their wi&s;e-teeth, &s;o called, at an advanced age, without any difficulty, and always with|out hazard. They likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that many children get their teeth ea&s;ily. But this argument mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the healthie&s;t,
<PB N="129" REF="026291_0146_0FCF890968C973B8">
and be&s;t nurtured children, to be, in all re|&s;pects, in the &s;ame circum&s;tances with adults, which is, by no means the ca&s;e; as they are liable to fever, dangerous purgings, and even convul&s;ions, from cau&s;es that would in no wi&s;e, affect the latter: nor can they &s;tand under &s;ome of tho&s;e com|plaints &s;o long as adults, nor endure the nece&s;&s;ary remedies. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the mea&s;les and &s;mall-pox carry off &s;uch numbers of infants, when attacked by them a little more &s;everely than common, whil&s;t young and healthy people often &s;truggle through the mo&s;t dangerous and complica|ted kinds, when properly treated from the beginning. Not to mention, that very few infants, who are unhappily affected with <HI>lues venerea,</HI> recover under any treatment, whil&s;t adults are cured in the mo&s;t advanced &s;tages of the complaint, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome parts may be actually mortified. I have, therefore, no doubt, that the time of teething ought to be ranked among&s;t the mo&s;t dangerous to infants, and that the greate&s;t attention ought to be paid to it; though it is probable that Dr. Arburthnot greatly over-rates its fatality, when he &s;ays that one child in ten may be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ink under it.</P>
<P>Some late writers, and particularly Mr. Le Febure De Villebrune, have conceived this to be a mere di&s;pute about words; but
<PB N="130" REF="026291_0147_0FCFA4DFA9491F50">
the difference, indeed, extends much far|ther. For though I would, indeed, by no means a&s;&s;ert dentition it&s;elf to be a di&s;ea&s;e, and have made u&s;e of any &s;uch like expre&s;&s;i|on merely in a popular way, yet am I con|fident it induces di&s;ea&s;e in very many infants of every habit of body, and more e&s;pecially, however &s;trange it may &s;eem, in the appa|rently healthy and robu&s;t. Indeed, weak and even rickety children, more commonly cut their teeth ea&s;ily, tho' often very late; or if they &s;hould be harra&s;ted by a purging, and other complaints, they, neverthele&s;s, e&s;cape with their lives oftener than lu&s;ty &s;trong children, who are frequently carried off &s;uddenly at this period, unle&s;s the teeth happen to find a very ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age through the gums. The &s;y&s;tem, during dentition, being di&s;po&s;ed to inflammation, &s;uch chil|dren mu&s;t oftener fall into fever than the tender and delicate; like athletic adults, who are more di&s;po&s;ed to inflammatory com|plaints, than tho&s;e who are of a colder, but le&s;s healthy temperament: and it is by acute fever, or convul&s;ions, that infants are carried off, who are well known to &s;urvive a thou|&s;and lingering and vexatious complaints, if their <HI>vi&s;cera</HI> be &s;ound.</P>
<P>This period u&s;ually commences between the fifth and tenth months, and the proce&s;s of the fir&s;t teething continues to the eigh|teenth at the lea&s;t, and &s;ometimes much lon|ger,
<PB N="131" REF="026291_0148_0FCFA4D9D26FA678">
The two front teeth in the lower jaw are u&s;ually cut the fir&s;t, and it is commonly a few weeks longer, before the corre&s;pond|ing ones in the upper jaw make their ap|pearance. After which, it is frequently a con&s;iderable time before the next under|teeth come out; but &s;ometimes, though not often, &s;ix or eight are cut in a ha&s;ty &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on. Children &s;ometimes cut their teeth ir|regularly, or cro&s;s, as it is called, both by the teeth appearing fir&s;t in the upper jaw, and al&s;o at a di&s;tance, in&s;tead of being con|tiguous to each other: this is accounted, and with &s;ome rea&s;on, indication of difficult, or painful dentition.</P>
<P>Teething is u&s;ually preceded and accom|panied with various &s;ymptoms: the child drivels, or &s;lavers much; the gums &s;well, &s;pread, and become hot; there is often a circum&s;cribed redne&s;s in the cheeks, and eruptions on the &s;kin, e&s;pecially on the face and &s;calp; a loo&s;ene&s;s, gripings, green &s;tools, watchings, &s;tartings in the &s;leep, and &s;pa&s;ms of particular parts; a diminution, or increa&s;|ed &s;ecretion of the urine, and di&s;charge of matter, with pain in making water, (imita|ting exactly a virulent <HI>gonorrhoea)</HI> which often mitigates the fever. A le&s;s common &s;ymptom, appearing only in certain habits, is a &s;welling of the tops of the feet and hands: it &s;eems, however, of no impor|tance, and goes away upon the appearance
<PB N="132" REF="026291_0149_0FCF8906A6EAF3A0">
of the teeth. I never met with it but in in|fants who cut them painfully; and being &s;eldom accompanied with a purging, it is likely may prevent that fever which is other|wi&s;e &s;o apt to attend. In all ca&s;es, the child &s;hrieks often, and thru&s;ts its fingers into its mouth: and the&s;e &s;ymptoms are &s;ometimes followed by a cough, difficult breathing, fits, fever, &s;crofula and mara&s;mus, or univer|&s;al decay.</P>
<P>Strong and healthy children cut their teeth both earlier and more ea&s;ily than the weak and tender. I have known a weak, and rickety child, without a tooth at twen|ty-two months old,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Primero&s;e &s;peaks of it being as late as the third, or even fourth year.</NOTE> though it lived to grow up; but at the age of five years became &s;cro|fulous. Therefore air, exerci&s;e, whole&s;ome food, an open belly, and every thing that has a tendency to promote general health, will greatly contribute to the &s;afety of den|tition.</P>
<P>Difficult teething is to be treated nearly as other acute di&s;ea&s;es with local inflamma|tion. If the body is at all bound, &s;ome opening medicine &s;hould be admini&s;tered, and it is to be ob&s;erved, that even a con&s;i|derable degree of loo&s;ene&s;s is u&s;eful; few children cutting teeth &s;o well as tho&s;e who&s;e bellies are at this time much more than com|monly
<PB N="133" REF="026291_0150_0FCFA4D875E77BF8">
open. Diluting drinks are al&s;o very nece&s;&s;ary, e&s;pecially if the child does not &s;uck; with a light food, in &s;mall quantities, and frequently taken. If much fever at|tends, the lo&s;s of a little blood, in &s;ome way, will be nece&s;&s;ary; though children do not endure bleeding &s;o well as they do other evacuations. If the propriety of bleeding with the lancet be doubted, a leech or two, as Harris advi&s;es, may be applied behind the ears, and is generally &s;erviceable. Cly|&s;ters are al&s;o very u&s;eful, e&s;pecially if there be retention of urine, which will likewi&s;e call for the u&s;e of the warm-bath. Gentle diaphoretics are al&s;o &s;erviceable, particularly of wine of antimony, or the <HI>antimonium tar|tari&s;atum,</HI> which be&s;ides opening the belly, often operate in this way: a bli&s;ter &s;hould likewi&s;e be applied between the &s;houlders, e&s;pecially if there is any di&s;po&s;ition to fits. And, indeed, if &s;tools do not afford &s;ome con&s;iderable relief, there &s;hould generally be &s;ome di&s;charge from the &s;kin; &s;ince a purging, and eruptions on the &s;kin, when &s;pontaneous, are the grand means of ea&s;y dentition. A little di&s;charge &s;hould there|fore, be kept up behind the ears, by rub|bing the parts with <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> flies, applying a thread as before directed, or putting on a &s;mall bli&s;ter; which may be kept open. A burgundy-pitch plai&s;ter laid on the back will &s;ometimes &s;uffice, which &s;hould be re|newed
<PB N="134" REF="026291_0151_0FCF8905A721C2E0">
every ten days, till the &s;ymptoms di&s;appear, or the teeth come into &s;ight. Even before this period, light &s;carifications of the gums are very u&s;eful, by taking off the ten&s;ion; or if the teeth are at all to be felt, lancing them, as it is called; the pro|per method of doing which will be noticed below.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e what I have to offer on the general plan of treatment, by ob&s;erving, that the indications certainly are to a&s;&s;i&s;t the eruption of the teeth, and to moderate the inflammatory and other &s;ymptoms: which mu&s;t be treated according to their kind: all parts of the body readily con&s;enting with the gums at the time of teething, but the nerves, the bowels, and the lungs, more particularly and importantly than the re&s;t. It has been ob&s;erved, that a purging is be|neficial, and it is, indeed, &s;urpri&s;ing how con&s;iderable a diarrhoea children will &s;tand on this occa&s;ion, and how very bad the &s;tools will often be for many weeks toge|ther, and a child happily &s;truggle through; though at another time, an equal degree of purging, with &s;uch bad &s;tools, and con&s;tant fever, would prove infallibly fatal. The diarrhoea is therefore not only to be cauti|ou&s;ly treated according to the directions al|ready given under the article of purging, but is oftentimes rather to be encouraged than &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Very pale &s;tools are at
<PB N="135" REF="026291_0152_0FCFA4D6D7730958">
this time not uncommon, and are &s;ometimes in va&s;t quantity: I have known an infant have fifty in one night, at le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> by the ac|count of a careful and di&s;creet nur&s;ery maid; and from the quantity of feces that I &s;aw the next morning, I had no rea&s;on to di&s;|pute her calculation.</P>
<P>For the fever of dentition, be&s;ides bleed|ing the ab&s;orbent powders are eminently u&s;eful, and are in various re&s;pects calculated to afford relief. To the&s;e, &s;ometimes a grain or two of Dr. James powder may be added at bed-time, which, if there &s;hould be any thing ami&s;s in the &s;tomach or bow|els will either vomit or purge, but other|wi&s;e (it has been &s;aid) will promote a kindly &s;weat, which is always beneficial. Nitre is very often u&s;eful, joined with the te&s;taceous powders, or a little of the compound powder of contrayerva&mdash;Sydenham directs three or four drops of the compound &s;pirit of ammo|nia <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;poonful of water every four hours, for four or five times, and I have thought it very &s;erviceable after proper evacuations; but this do&s;e may be con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, according to the age of the child. Nor is a drop or two of laudanum to be feared, if the bowels have been previou&s;ly opened, the pain be very great, and the breathing not difficult.</P>
<P>A principal indication, it has been &s;aid, is to a&s;&s;i&s;t the eruption of the teeth. This
<PB N="136" REF="026291_0153_0FCF89038A5B88F8">
is attempted, by cooling, &s;edative, and de|mulcent applications made to the gums; by rubbing them with &s;ome hard, poli&s;hed body, &s;uch as the coral; or by dividing them with the lancet: which la&s;t is the on|ly mean to be depended upon. When it is found nece&s;&s;ary to lance the gums, (which is ever, at lea&s;t, a &s;afe operation) it &s;hould always be done effectually, with a proper gum-lancet, and not with a needle, a thin &s;ix-pence, or &s;uch like in&s;trument, which will not &s;ufficiently divide the gum, or the &s;trong membrane that covers the teeth. The lancet &s;hould always be carried quite down to them, and even be drawn acro&s;s the dou|ble teeth. It is certain, that this litle ope|ration gives &s;carcely any pain, and the re|lief is at the &s;ame time often &s;o con&s;iderable that the child appears exceedingly plea&s;ed with it, and will immediately &s;queeze the jaws and grind them together forcibly, which proves the gums are not very &s;en&s;i|ble.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t painful part of dentition, and that in which children are mo&s;t expo&s;ed to convul&s;ions, is u&s;ually from the teeth cut|ting through the <HI>perio&s;teum</HI> (or nervous membrane mentioned above) that covers the jaw immediately under the gums. This, I apprehend, in difficult dentition, is often not cut through, but is forced up before the teeth, when they are even in &s;ight under
<PB N="137" REF="026291_0154_0FCFA4D567360E30">
the thin gum; hence it is, that cutting through the gum is &s;o very often u&s;eful, and takes off fever and convul&s;ions, which &s;evere &s;ymptoms could not ari&s;e merely from piercing the gum, which, it has been &s;aid, is not a very &s;en&s;ible part. At other times; the pain and fever &s;eem to ari&s;e from almo&s;t the very fir&s;t &s;hooting of the teeth within the jaw, and then they will very often not appear for &s;ome weeks after the gums have been properly lanced; and parents are therefore apt to conclude, the lancing has been unnece&s;&s;arily done. I am, however, convinced from experience, that this little operation, though not in the general e&s;teem it <HI>ought</HI> to be (and by the <HI>French</HI> phy&s;icians even dreaded at this period)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Lieutaud.</HI></NOTE> is often inex|pre&s;&s;ibly u&s;eful, and appears to have &s;av|ed many lives, after the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ymptoms had taken place, and every other mean of cure had been made u&s;e of. And I cannot here for bear expre&s;&s;ing my &s;urprize, at the fears &s;ome people entertain of lancing the gums, and their delaying it &s;o long, if not altogether rejecting it, though no evil can po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from the operation. On the other hand, its advantages are &s;o great, that whenever convul&s;ions take place about the u&s;ual period of dentition, recour&s;e ought
<PB N="138" REF="026291_0155_0FCFA4D396B40EB8">
always to be had to it, after an un&s;ucce&s;sful u&s;e of other means; though by an exami|nation of the gums there may be no cer|tain evidence of the convul&s;ions being ow|ing to &s;uch cau&s;e; the irritation from teething, it has been remarked, often tak|ing place in a very early &s;tage of the bu|&s;ine&s;s. At any rate, it has been &s;aid, the operation can do no harm, even at any period, and &s;hould the &s;hooting of teeth be only an aggravation to the true cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, lancing the gums mu&s;t be attended with advantage. But &s;hould teeth|ing be the proper and &s;ole cau&s;e, it is evi|dent how fruitle&s;s any other mean of re|lief mu&s;t frequently be: for &s;hould convul|&s;ions, for in&s;tance, take place from a thorn run into the finger, or toe, the proper indi|cation of cure, by an immediate extraction of the thorn, and the probable futility of other means, would be equally obvious.</P>
<P>The operation may al&s;o be &s;afely repeat|ed, the &s;cars doing no kind of harm. And indeed it will be frequently nece&s;&s;ary to lance the gums &s;everal times, on account of the extraordinary difficulty with which &s;ome infants cut their teeth, e&s;pecially the double ones, which are furni&s;hed with two or more knobs or points. Fever, purging, and even convul&s;ions will &s;ometimes ari&s;e from only one point of a large tooth offending the <HI>pe|rio&s;teum</HI> that covers it, and being nearer the
<PB N="139" REF="026291_0156_0FCF890205CE09C8">
&s;urface than the other points, the lancet &s;ometimes does not completely divide the membrane that lies over the re&s;t; and this part not being injured by the tooth, the &s;ymptoms &s;ub&s;ide on having divided that portion of membrane that was inflamed. But in a little time, another point of the &s;ame tooth is found to irritate the <HI>perio&s;teum,</HI> and calls for the like a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the lancet, which again removes all the complaints. This, at lea&s;t, I have conceived to be the proce&s;s, when I have found lancing a large tooth immediately remove every terrible &s;ymptom, though the fever and other com|plaints have returned, and the tooth not ap|peared till the operation has been three or four times repeated. I have &s;een the like good effect from it, when children have been cutting a number of teeth in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and have bred them all with convul&s;ions. Nothing having relieved or prevented the&s;e terrible &s;ymptoms but lancing the gums, which has removed them every time it has been done, one or more teeth appearing a day or two after each operation.&mdash;In &s;uch ca&s;es, it will often be proper to draw a lan|cet along a great part of one, or even both the jaws, at the &s;ame operation.</P>
<P>Some writers, however, and Dr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> particularly, have advi&s;ed, not to cut quite down to the teeth, but only to &s;carify the gums, unle&s;s the teeth are very near. He

&s;u&s;pects that the in&s;trument often injures them, and produces caries, which he thinks will be communicated to the &s;ucceeding &s;et of teeth. But this is a needle&s;s &s;cruple, and I apprehend ari&s;es for want of duly at|tending to the &s;tate of the teeth, which are perfect bone, and covered with a &s;trong enamel, long before they get through the gums. The manner of the &s;econd teething of children likewi&s;e forbids &s;uch a fear; for though the fir&s;t &s;et, which are de&s;igned by nature to be only of &s;hort duration) &s;hould actually be injured by the lancet, the &s;uc|ceeding ones are not at all likely to be af|fected by the carious &s;tate of the former. For the fir&s;t teeth of infants con&s;tantly be|come carious at the roots, and are loo&s;ened and expelled by that means, when left to nature alone; and though the upper parts of the new teeth are in contact with the ca|rious bottoms of the fir&s;t &s;et, they never &s;uf|fer from this circum&s;tance. I have dwelt the longer on this head, becau&s;e writers are not agreed on the &s;ubject, and it is a mat|ter oftentimes of no &s;mall importance.

It has been hinted to be a common prac|tice to touch the gums with oils and mucil|ages, and to rub them with &s;ome hard and poli&s;hed body. To an&s;wer the fir&s;t inten|tion, perhaps a little honey, or &s;yrup of white poppys is as proper as any thing, or the honey may be lightly acidulated with &s;pirit of vitriol. Be&s;ides the coral, a cru&s;t of bread, or a piece of liquorice root, may be often carried to the mouth, and may &s;ometimes be preferable, as they will yield a little to the pre&s;&s;ure of the gums.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be a pretty general rule during the time of teething, to abate a little of the u&s;ual quantity of food, and the encrea&s;e the quantity of drink; unle&s;s the child is very weakly, or every thing is going on per|fectly well: or if the child be at the brea&s;t, a &s;imilar regard ought to be paid to the diet of the nur&s;e.</P>
<P>Children will &s;ometimes have ulcerated gums in teething, and more frequently where they have not been lanced, which are ea&s;i|ly cured by keeping the body open, and touching them with a&s;tringent applications. As much white vitriol, or roch alum as will give a moderate roughne&s;s to a little honey, is u&s;ually &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e.

<HEAD>FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH &s;ome writers have &s;uppo&s;ed infants to be as liable to fevers as adults, and from the &s;ame cau&s;es, I have, by no means, found it &s;o, and I wi&s;h parents to take comfort from the con&s;ideration; hav|ing ob&s;erved for many years, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell in the ho&s;pital, as in private practice, that infants do not readily take common fevers, though expo&s;ed for a long time to that contagion which has appeared to affect adults around them. Their fevers are al&s;o of a &s;hort duration if properly treated, unle&s;s the few that ari&s;e from &s;ome more permanent irritating cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Young children, however, are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ome febrile complaints peculiar to them|&s;elves; which, as I have enlarged this edi|tion con&s;iderably, with the de&s;ign of taking in all their complaints, I &s;hall be&s;tow &s;ome pains in &s;pecifying, as well as pointing out the treatment mo&s;t adapted to each.</P>
<P>The more frequent cau&s;es of fever, are teething, foul bowels, worms, glandular di&s;ea&s;es, &s;ome eruptive and very contagious complaint, or taking cold, and are often attended with &s;ymptoms peculiar to children. If from the la&s;t mentioned cau&s;e, and the cold be &s;evere, it will always be attended with a cough, hoar&s;ene&s;s, and &s;ome difficulty
<PB N="143" REF="026291_0160_0FCFA4C8AF6D28B8">
of breathing, and often with running at the no&s;e or eyes, which will di&s;tingui&s;h the fe|ver from all others, except it be the mea|&s;les; which will be attended likewi&s;e with violent &s;neezing, and a peculiar appearance of the eyes not often met with in a common cold.</P>
<P>If a fever from cold be con&s;iderable, the cough violent, and the difficulty of breath|ing very great, a bli&s;ter will always be &s;afe and expedient, and may be applied at the pit of the &s;tomach in&s;tead of the back, as be|ing both le&s;s painful under any motion of the body, and more readily got at to be dre&s;&s;ed, or for the application of fre&s;h cloths, where the di&s;charge happens to be con&s;i|derable. But if the fever and difficulty of breathing &s;hould not be very much abated by the bli&s;ter, children though within the twelve-month, will bear and even be great|ly benefited by the lo&s;s of a little blood,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In mittendo &s;anguine, non tam annos medicus numerare, quam vires aegrotantis ae&s;timare debet.

In the little fevers ari&s;|ing from taking cold, to which &s;ome chil|dren are very liable, I often join it with a little of Dr. James's powder, (proportion|ed to the age) and a few grains of the com|pound powder of contrayerva, lowered with te&s;tacea; which I find to be a medicine ex|ceedingly u&s;eful, when given in time.

<P>If the fever be not owing to taking cold, to worms, teething, or &s;ome eruptive com|plaint,

it will generally be found to ari&s;e from &s;ome foulne&s;s in the fir&s;t-pa&s;&s;ages, in which ca&s;e, opening the belly, and after|wards giving a puke and the te&s;taceous pow|ders, u&s;ually remove it. But if otherwi&s;e, opening medicines mu&s;t be continued a while longer, e&s;pecially ca&s;tor-oil; but if the &s;tools are very fetid, the ba&s;ilic powder, or &s;mall do&s;es of calomel are the fitte&s;t purge; though they require to be admini&s;tered with caution. I have known not only convul&s;i|ons, but paralytic affections, attended with great pain and continual fever, induced merely, as I apprehend, by a foul &s;tate of the bowels; where, after the complaint has been un&s;ucce&s;sfully treated as a fever of a|nother kind, all the &s;ymptoms have been removed at once by an active purge. Even infants of only three or four months old will often have very con&s;iderable fever, and fits, with &s;o co&s;tive a &s;tate of the bowels as to require &s;trong purgative medicines to be re|peated for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days, with cly&s;|ters and the warm-bath, before the ob&s;truc|tion can be removed, or the fever will at all abate.

Any of them will form an admirable medicine for very young children, as well under little fe|vers, as for almo&s;t all their complaints not attended with much co&s;tivene&s;s. This, the judicious Harris was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of, that he thinks them alone &s;ufficient to effect almo&s;t every thing during the <HI>infant</HI> &s;tate, and has done un&s;peakable &s;ervice by aboli&s;hing that <HI>indi&s;criminate</HI> recour&s;e to cordials, and other heating and rough medicines, &s;uch as mer|cury, <HI>aurum fulminans, theriaca,</HI> &amp;c. to|gether with various anile and &s;uper&s;titious remedies, which the ancient writers fre|quently recommended on occa&s;ions peculi|arly improper.

I have, indeed, lately expe|rienced very good effects from per&s;evering in the u&s;e of &s;mall do&s;es of wine of antimo|ny, given in a &s;aline draught, in the little ob&s;cure fevers of infants, where the cau&s;e has not been &s;o obvious as it common|ly is.</P>
<P>On the decline of &s;ome fevers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e ari&s;ing from fowl bowels, it is not un|common to &s;ee an eruption on the &s;kin, re|&s;embling that called the red-gum, in the month, and &s;ometimes even the thru&s;h will make its appearance, though the infant may have had that complaint already; which are marks of the great di&s;turbance the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages have &s;uffered, and of the con&s;ent they have with the &s;kin; the former, it has been &s;aid, is always a favourable indication; but the ob&s;ervation does not hold good in regard to the thru&s;h.</P>
<P>Fevers in children of three or four years old, are &s;ometimes tedious of cure by any of the above means, and like tho&s;e of adults, require the bark; which &s;hould be admi|ni&s;tered

The like appearances have been met with in adults, and e&s;pecially females, but perhaps more commonly in children from three to ten years of age; and are not peculiar to &s;cro|fulous habits. As far as my experience has gone, (for I believe it is not a very common complaint) they are conjoined more fre|quently with that fever which attends a foul &s;tate of the bowels, than with any other; which therefore requires repeated purging, e&s;pecially with calomel; and on this ac|count, the <HI>pulvis &egrave; &s;cammon. cum calomel.</HI> becomes a convenient preparation.

<HEAD>MESENTERIC-FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER cau&s;e of fever has been hinted at, which is ob&s;tructed glands, e&s;pecially the <HI>me&s;enteric;</HI> and is often a fore-runner of the true hectic fever, or fatal mara&s;mus.</P>
<P>It, indeed, frequently ari&s;es from &s;crofu|la, which then di&s;covers it&s;elf by other marks; and will require its peculiar treat|ment. But there is an early &s;tage of glan|dular ob&s;truction in the me&s;entery, and of the fever here alluded to, that is often fal&s;ely attributed to worms; but will not yield to mere purgative medicines. It at|tacks children from the age of three or four years, the fever remitting, and &s;ometimes intermitting irregularly; is attended with lo&s;s of appetite, &s;welled belly, and pain in the bowels; the latter more commonly tak|ing place, more or le&s;s, every day, or is generally more violent if the child be a day or two free from it. After opening the bowels, half a grain, or a grain of calo|mel may be given to advantage, two or three times a week, and on the intermediate days &s;mall do&s;es of the <HI>natron ppt.</HI> either alone, or neutralized with the juice of lemons, or

in &s;ome in&s;tances partially &s;o. If the belly be very co&s;tive, as it often is, an infu&s;ion of the burnt &s;ponge and &s;enna is more effec|tual than any thing; and when &s;trained through filtering paper, make a neat pre|paration, and an excellent remedy for many little fevers, in older children, when the <HI>primae viae,</HI> or fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages are concerned. When the glandular fever, ju&s;t now men|tioned, has abated, &s;ome light bitter, as of camomile flowers, is u&s;eful to brace the &s;to|mach and bowels; and to prevent a relap&s;e, it will often be found nece&s;&s;ary to admini&s;ter &s;ome chalybeate, of which the <HI>tinct. flor. martialium</HI> is u&s;ually the mo&s;t proper for chil|dren.</P>
<P>But as this fever, from its great fatality and frequency, has lately very much enga|ged the attention of writers, it may be pro|per to con&s;ider it a little more di&s;tinctly in &s;ome of its principal &s;tages; in each of which its nature and treatment &s;ometimes materially differ. For before the me&s;ente|ric glands become much enlarged, or the fe|ver continual; whil&s;t the appetite continues, and the fir&s;t dige&s;tion is but little impaired, and no purging has taken place; the open|ing mixture of &s;ponge and &s;enna, with a few do&s;es of calomel, and afterwards bitters and chalybeates, are the only remedies very likely to be called for. In this &s;tate, the di&s;order may &s;till be con&s;idered as in its fir&s;t
<PB N="153" REF="026291_0170_0FCFA4B2108CE870">
&s;tage, and of which an unu&s;ual co&s;tivene&s;s, the hardne&s;s and recurring pains in the bel|ly, and an intermitting fever, are the prin|cipal &s;ymptoms. The limits of this work, however, will not allow of a particular de|tail of the many others that attend this fever through its various &s;tages; and it is pre&s;um|ed, they are &s;o well known to medical peo|ple as to render it unnece&s;&s;ary. But in ge|neral, it may be &s;aid, that indige&s;tion, co&s;|tivene&s;s or purging; irregular appetite; flu&s;hed cheeks, or a total lo&s;s of colour; impaired &s;trength and &s;pirits; remitting fe|ver; and a hard and tumid belly, with ema|ciated limbs, are among&s;t the more con&s;tant &s;ymptoms attending, at one period or other of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Children are liable to it from their infan|cy to &s;ix or eight years of age, it being often a con&s;equence of the long continuance of almo&s;t any of the preceding complaints, e&s;|pecially tho&s;e of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages and denti|tion, as well as the mea&s;les, and a few o|thers; of which that from teething will be &s;eparately con&s;idered. Among the poor, it is too frequently owing to a coar&s;e and unwhole&s;ome diet; indige&s;tion at the &s;to|mach, and a con&s;equent vitiated chyle, with infarction, or ob&s;tructions in &s;ome of the internal glands or lymphatics, being among the primary remote cau&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>HECTIC FEVER, and MARASMUS.</HEAD>
<P>NOT a few, both of the preceding and following complaints, are &s;ometimes found to induce a confirmed hectic fever, and mara&s;mus, or a wa&s;ting of the whole body, called by &s;ome writers <HI>Atrophia Lac|tantium;</HI> though it often comes on too late properly to admit of the name.

<P>This fever, as it is apt to ari&s;e from other
<PB N="160" REF="026291_0177_0FCFA4AB27C6A1E8">
complaints, is very often owing to their ha|ving been imprudently treated, or imper|fectly cured, e&s;pecially by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;ome eruption or di&s;charge from the &s;kin, or in|cautiou&s;ly &s;topping a purging during the time of teething. In &s;uch ca&s;es, and indeed whenever the hectic fever is of &s;ome &s;tand|ing, the me&s;enteric glands become indurated, greatly increa&s;ed in &s;ize, and often &s;uppu|rate, the belly getting large, though the limbs and other parts become emaciated; which &s;tate has been treated in the former chapter, and has been &s;hewn to be curable, or otherwi&s;e, according to the degree of in|duration, and the length of the time it has exi&s;ted. But there is &s;ometimes a threaten|ing appearance of hectic fever, where ne|verthele&s;s nature effects a &s;alutary and won|derful change, and will re&s;tore the emacia|ted infant as from the very jaws of death. And this, indeed, is often the work only of nature, art doing no more than &s;uperin|tending it, and preventing her being coun|teracted by the u&s;e of improper medicines, or diet.</P>
<P>Nature alone will, indeed, oftentimes effect wonders for infants, and far beyond any thing to be expected in adults, if &s;he be not officiou&s;ly counteracted. And the rea&s;on is obvious, it being well ob&s;erved by

farther &s;upport of this &s;entiment it may be ob&s;erved, that their complaints are not often attended with acute fever, like tho&s;e of adults, which is di&s;po&s;ed rather to break up the &s;y&s;tem, than to rectify the machine.</P>
<P>The above mentioned &s;alutary turns in the true hectic fever, as far as I have ob&s;er|ved, are chiefly in that &s;pecies of it ari&s;ing from worms or teething; and in which I have known recoveries after hope had long been given up, and all attempts been laid a&s;ide. There is, indeed, an atrophy, or uni|ver&s;al decay in infants, for want of the brea&s;t, or from the un&s;uitablene&s;s of it, or of what|ever el&s;e may be the child's ordinary food, (as I &s;hall in&s;tance in another place:) but this is not u&s;ually attended with fever, and is to be cured merely by making that change, which the nature of the different occa&s;ions points out. Harris recounts &s;ome remarkable recoveries in what he calls the <HI>Atrophia vermino&s;a,</HI> (or Worm-hectic) and attributes the cures to the free u&s;e of the <HI>hydrargyrus cum &s;ulphure,</HI> carefully prepa|red; but I have &s;een none &s;o marvellous as in the <HI>Atrophia Dententium,</HI> or Tooth-atrophy. In this, I have known children after being reduced by purging, and other complaints, lying for three months together in the cradle, &s;carcely fit to be moved, with continual fever, flu&s;hed cheeks, emaciated countenance and limbs, a large belly, ince&s;&s;ant cough, and

almo&s;t without taking any nouri&s;hment, re|cover, as it were in a few days, upon un|expectedly cutting half a dozen teeth.</P>
<P>After what I have &s;aid on this fever, it will not be expected I &s;hould offer much on the head of medicines; I &s;hall therefore only ob&s;erve, that after making trial of the mixture recommended by Boerhaave,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 85.</NOTE> when acidity may prevail in the bowels, or pre|&s;cribing opening medicines, as directed un|der the heads of co&s;tivene&s;s and purging, are the chief indications in this advanced &s;tage of the complaint. With this view, Sydenham's rhubarb-beer,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Take of choice rhubarb &s;liced, two drams; let it be put into a gla&s;s bottle, well &s;topped, with a quart of &s;mall-beer, or any other liquor the child may make u&s;e of. This medicated beer is to be his ordinary drink. When this quantity is drank, a &s;econd, and a third quart of beer may be poured on, as before; after which the rhubarb will commonly have lo&s;t its virtue. Should the beer fir&s;t poured on be too much impregnated with rhubarb, and purge too much, another pint may be added pre&s;ently af|ter the fir&s;t is drank up.</NOTE> and purging with mercury, if that has not already been done, &s;hould even now be attempted, &s;ince children in this &s;tate will often bear &s;tronger do&s;es of purging medicines, and more fre|quently repeated, than under any other cir|cum&s;tances.&mdash;Some attention, however, &s;hould be paid to the diet, which ought
<PB N="164" REF="026291_0181_0FCFA4A0D8C13C08">
chiefly to be of milk, rice, &s;emolina, and &s;uch like, with light puddings; but above all, plenty of fre&s;h air, and as much exer|ci&s;e as the weak &s;tate of the child will bear.</P>
<P>In Dr. Arm&s;trong's &s;econd edition, is a pretty long chapter on the hectic fever of teething children, wherein &s;everal medicines are pre&s;cribed, which the doctor appre|hends may be very &s;erviceable early in the di&s;ea&s;e. He &s;peaks of it as a very common complaint, beginning like other fevers, and gradually becoming remitting; then a &s;low continual fever, and terminating in a fatal hectic.</P>
<P>It is very probable, that a fever of this de&s;cription, may be common among pau|pers, relieved at di&s;pen&s;aries, and may de|&s;erve &s;uch a name, but, I believe, it will be rarely met with in higher ranks of life; and if &s;o, perhaps, that ought to have been intimated in a popular work. It &s;eems to me, (and Dr. Arm&s;trong, indeed, &s;ays as much) to ari&s;e from improper food and nur|&s;ing, joined with a co&s;tive &s;tate of the bowels, and is therefore, very much the offspring of neglect. When advice is &s;ought for in pro|per time, it, accordingly, appears to be nothing more than the common fever I have de&s;cribed, ari&s;ing from a foul &s;tate of the bowels, and is ea&s;ily cured by &s;uch medicines as are be&s;t calculated to clear the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages. Should this, however, be neglected, it may
<PB N="165" REF="026291_0182_0FCFA49F56F2A240">
degenerate into a continual fever; but it is not even then peculiar to the age Dr. Arm|&s;trong has &s;pecified, nor, by any means, the common hectic fever of dentition.</P>

<P>WHENEVER the Scarlet-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ver becomes epidemic among adults, children rare|ly fail being attacked by it, in great num|bers, and frequently &s;ink under it.

<P>The milde&s;t &s;pecies of <HI>&s;carla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ina angino&s;a</HI> &s;hould, however, be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from the true inflammatory affection of the ton&s;ils, which the <HI>angina maligna</HI> will &s;ome|times re&s;emble in its fir&s;t &s;tages: but the genuine marks of the two di&s;ea&s;es, and the ca&s;t of the epidemics reigning at the time, will direct the attentive practitioner; who will in le&s;s certain ca&s;es, take a middle cour&s;e in his method of treatment, till the charac|teri&s;tic &s;ymptoms of either &s;hall become more evident.</P>
<P>There is, however, a &s;carlet-fever that is not atended with any affection of the throat, and was long ago de&s;cribed by Sydenham,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See al&s;o Withering and Cullen.</NOTE> though not much in&s;i&s;ted upon by later wri|ters, which is attended with a harder pul&s;e, and other &s;ymptoms of an inflammatory di&s;po&s;ition, but neverthele&s;s, in every in|&s;tance that I have met with, calls for the &s;ame general treatment, only more cauti|ou&s;ly adapting the nece&s;&s;ary cordials and to|nics to the degree of fever, e&s;pecially in the commencement of the complaint.</P>

&s;ickne&s;s, a quick pul&s;e, and pain in the head. The eyes are often inflamed, and where the throat is affected, there is fre|quently a &s;tiffne&s;s of the mu&s;cles of the neck very early in the di&s;ea&s;e, which is &s;oon fol|lowed by &s;ome difficulty in &s;wallowing.

<P>The limits of this work allow me only to ob&s;erve, that the method of cure being di|directed to the two indications of the gene|ral diathe&s;is, and the affection of the throat, the nature and extent of the&s;e mu&s;t ever be kept in view, and the &s;y&s;tem be duly &s;up|ported.

<P>This fever, e&s;pecially when epidemic, being almo&s;t con&s;tantly of a low type, the phy&s;ician mu&s;t not tru&s;t to &s;aline draughts, or other medicines of that cla&s;s, without the addition of the aromatic confection,

&s;nake-root, or the bark, in one form or other; and be&s;ide the&s;e, &s;hould direct a mo|derate quantity of wine to be given with the food, according to the age and other cir|cum&s;tances of the patient.</P>
<P>Should the affection of the throat there|fore to be evidently inflammatory, or &s;hould a ca&s;e occur where the fever may &s;eem to be of that kind, (which may be better a&s;certain|ed by the hardne&s;s of the pul&s;e than any other &s;ymptom) it will rarely, if ever, bear bleed|ing, even in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, as &s;ymptoms of debility generally attend in &s;ome period of the &s;carlet-fever, and will al|low only of that middle cour&s;e of treatment, hinted above.</P>
<P>In a general way, a cordial plan is re|quired throughout the di&s;ea&s;e, and where the throat is much affected, either with &s;loughs, or total blackne&s;s, the bark is in|di&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, howe&s;over thick and florid the ra&s;h, or however hot and dry the &s;kin may be; the bark, as it were, ex|tingui&s;hing the fever above every other re|medy.

<P>IT were very foreign to the pre&s;ent inten|tion to treat di&s;tinctly of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es and their &s;everal varieties, being in no re|&s;pect peculiar to childhood, and are noticed only to point out a few principal indicati|ons, and to introduce &s;ome ob&s;ervations in regard to the propere&s;t time for inocu|lation.</P>
<P>Though the SMALL-POX is a complaint &s;o incident to the early part of life, that comparatively few children living to the age of eight or ten years, are found to e&s;cape it, yet it is not &s;o readily communicated, in the &s;tate of <HI>infancy,</HI> as hath been general|ly imagined, unle&s;s by immediate infection.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some evidence of the propriety of this a&s;&s;er|tion may be gathered from the con&s;ideration of there always exi&s;ting a far greater number of infants within the month, than of children of any other age; and for the like rea&s;on, a greater number of tho&s;e under a year old, than of &s;uch as are two or three years of age. For, every infant that dies at the earlier periods, reduces the number to which tho&s;e of the more advanced ages might otherwi&s;e have amounted; whereas, all the children who ar|rive to two or three years of age, having been fir&s;t infants in the month, and of one year old, the num|ber of the latter periods is not dimini&s;hed by the death of tho&s;e of a more advanced age. Now, eve|ry one knows how very few infants he has heard of who have received the &s;mall-pox, naturally, in the mouth, or even within the year; though few|er of the&s;e are inoculated than of children above a year old. And this exemption from the natural &s;mall-pox does not &s;eem to ari&s;e from their not be|ing expo&s;ed to the ordinary means of contagion, e&s;pecially among the middling and lower ranks of people who form the bulk of mankind; &s;ince the medical men who u&s;ually attend &s;uch lying in rooms, are very much in the habit both of vi&s;iting the &s;mall-pox, and of inoculating, all the year round: and even in the higher ranks of life, if gentlemen in the general practice of phy&s;ic happen to be con&s;ulted, the chance of their vi&s;iting at the &s;ame time infected patients, is not &s;o &s;mall as may be imagined; not to &s;peak of the probability there is, that &s;ome one of the numerous vi&s;itors, during the month, may by accident or otherwi&s;e, have been in &s;ome infected hou&s;e in the cour&s;e of the day in which their vi&s;its may be made.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="026291_0189_0FCFA49279E555B8">
The poor furni&s;h frequent in&s;tances of the truth of this ob&s;ervation. I have at|tended where children born in an air, &s;atu|rated as it were, with the mia&s;ma of this di&s;ea&s;e, (as well as of the mea&s;les) and even lying continually in a cradle in which ano|ther child has died a few days before, have neverthele&s;s e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;ome|times when they have &s;lept together in the &s;ame bed with one loaded with it. Hence it appears that highly tainted air, and even per&s;onal contact, are often in&s;ufficient to communicate the virus. Yet we know that
<PB N="173" REF="026291_0190_0FCFA48E27A02A40">
infants are very ea&s;ily infected, receiving the &s;mall-pox by inoculation as readily as adults; though neither are at all times e|qually &s;u&s;ceptible of it. Perhaps this latter circum&s;tance may not always be &s;ufficiently attended to; the mode of inoculation being often blamed, when its failure may be ow|ing to the indi&s;po&s;ed habit of the child. Po&s;&s;ibly, on this account, it may not be perfectly &s;afe to urge it, at &s;uch a time; at lea&s;t, in&s;tances are not wanting, where twice introducing the virus having failed, an in|fant has had the di&s;ea&s;e very &s;everely, and even fatally, upon its being repeated a third time.</P>
<P>But in whatever way the &s;mall-pox or mea&s;les may take place, they are to be treated as in adults, with but little other difference than what every practitioner is well acquainted with, that of greater cau|tion and tenderne&s;s; as infants cannot bear the powerful antiphlogi&s;tic regimen and eva|cuations, often proper for the other.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ex toto, non &s;ic pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ri, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t viri, curari deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t.

<P>In the treatment of the MEASLES, not only ought children's bellies to be kept open throughout the di&s;ea&s;e, but unle&s;s they are very young, they will bear and even require one or more bleedings, at any period of it when the &s;ymptoms indicate its propriety.
<PB N="174" REF="026291_0191_0FCFA48BA24FD810">
And, indeed, the cure of the &s;econdary fe|ver, however long it may continue, will turn upon repeated bleedings, laxatives, and a total ab&s;tinence from wine, and all animal food.</P>
<P>I have now only to drop a word or two on the &s;ubject of <HI>Inoculation,</HI> becau&s;e pa|rents are very apt to fall into great mi&s;takes re&s;pecting the age, and circum&s;tances mo&s;t proper for this operation.</P>
<P>It is too common an opinion that a very young infant, &s;ucking at the brea&s;t, is the fitte&s;t &s;ubject for inoculation, and medical people have &s;ome difficulty in per&s;uading parents to the contrary. Children are then &s;aid to be clear from humors, their blood mild and bal&s;amic, their food innocent, and they are free from all violent pa&s;&s;ions of the mind. But all the&s;e advantages may be counter-balanced by the delicacy of their frame, their di&s;po&s;ition to &s;pa&s;m, and their inability to &s;truggle with a &s;evere attack of the di&s;ea&s;e, if it &s;hould chance to fall to their &s;hare. And &s;uch, indeed, are the facts; infants u&s;ually have the &s;mall-pox very lightly, whether taken naturally, or from inoculation; though in both there are in&s;tances of their expiring in a fit at the time of the eruption; and they &s;eldom get through the di&s;ea&s;e, if they are full, or it proves of the confluent, or malignant kind. And this furni&s;hes a peculiar objection to
<PB N="175" REF="026291_0192_0FCF88ECAE395408">
inoculating infants at the brea&s;t, which ari&s;es from their nece&s;&s;arily lying &s;o much on the arm of the mother, or the wet-nur&s;e, e&s;pe|cially in the night; the heat expo&s;ing them to a much more copious eruption, than children who are weaned. This I have &s;een clearly exemplified in the in&s;tance of a child who&s;e mother could &s;uckle only with the right brea&s;t; the con&s;equence was, that the left &s;ide of the child was perfectly load|ed with the eruption, (though the pock was of the di&s;tinct kind) whil&s;t the other had on|ly a very moderate &s;prinkling. The child, however, &s;unk under the &s;econdary fever at the end of five or &s;ix weeks, though turned of two years old; the <HI>only</HI> child I have known to die of inoculation at &s;o ad|vanced an age.</P>
<P>I am aware that many children are inocu|lated very young, and even in the month, and generally with very good &s;ucce&s;s; but the frequency of this practice, among emi|nent &s;urgeons, its owing to the urgent &s;oli|citation of parents, and their fear of conta|gion. I cannot therefore avoid &s;aying, that however few may die under inoculation, un|der any circum&s;tances, the fact is, that the far greater proportion that I happen to have had an account of, is among&s;t infants under &s;ix months old.</P>
<P>From this view of the matter, it is pret|ty evident, I think, that this operation
<PB N="176" REF="026291_0193_0FCFA489A68AE1E0">
ought, u&s;ually, to be po&s;tponed to a later period, which is pointed out by the child having cut all its fir&s;t teeth. To which may be added the ob&s;ervation ju&s;t made, that infants are not much di&s;po&s;ed to take the &s;mall-pox naturally, and that fifty chil|dren die under the age of two years, of o|ther complaints, to one that dies of the na|tural &s;mall-pox. Should it, however, be in the &s;ame hou&s;e, or prevail in the neigh|bourhood, and the parents find it difficult to remove the child out of the way, it may run a le&s;s ri&s;k in being immediately inocu|lated, as that operation is now &s;o well un|der&s;tood, and &s;ucce&s;sfully conducted, than by taking the chance of e&s;caping the infec|tion, or of recovering from the di&s;ea&s;e, if it &s;hould happen to take place.</P>

<HEAD>CHICKEN-POX.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the rea&s;on given in the former chap|ter, I &s;hall be very brief on this head. The complaint, neverthele&s;s, merits a few words, not only becau&s;e more incident, per|haps, to children than to adults, but al&s;o that parents are often at a lo&s;s to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the mild &s;mall-pox; which it &s;ome|times exceeds in violence, and is now and then even attended with danger. This is, indeed, not often the ca&s;e, and the di&s;ea&s;e
<PB N="177" REF="026291_0194_0FCF88E4A46959A0">
has therefore been very &s;eldom noticed by medical writers; and even Dr. Heberden, who was among the fir&s;t that obliged the public with a di&s;tinct account of it, &s;ays he never &s;aw any per&s;on with &s;o many as three hundred pu&s;tules over the whole body. Phy|&s;icians, indeed, as he ob&s;erves, are not of|ten called to vi&s;it patients under a complaint u&s;ually &s;o trifling, or a gentleman of his long and exten&s;ive practice, would have met with in&s;tances in which it mu&s;t have appeared of more con&s;equence, as will pre|&s;ently be noticed.</P>
<P>It is from this di&s;parity, I apprehend, that this di&s;order is &s;ometimes denominated the <HI>&s;wine-pox,</HI> which is only a ranker &s;pecies of the di&s;ea&s;e, in which the &s;ymptoms may run higher, as well as the pu&s;tules become much larger. In this ca&s;e, I have known the head and face as much &s;wollen as I have ever &s;een them in any di&s;tinct &s;mall-pox, however full, and the pu&s;tules containing a yellow, and &s;eemingly purulent matter, with highly in|flamed ba&s;es, and exceedingly &s;ore; and the&s;e have formed a complete ma&s;k on the face, after the turn, as is often &s;een in the &s;mall-pox. One &s;uch patient whom I was called to vi&s;it, was about &s;ixteen years of age, of a plethoric habit, but very healthy; and what makes it very certain, that this complaint could not be the &s;mall-pox, is, that the young gentleman died of that di&s;|order
<PB N="178" REF="026291_0195_0FCFA488166068A8">
a twelvemonth afterwards, and po&s;&s;i|bly owing to its being neglected in the be|ginning, from an idea that the former illne&s;s had really been the &s;mall-pox. The latter mi&s;take aro&s;e from an improper an&s;wer hav|ing been then made to my enquiry after the day on which the eruption had fir&s;t appear|ed (as I was not called in to vi&s;it him till the di&s;order was at the height); a mi&s;take the young gentleman's mother had a perfect recollection of after I was gone, and of which I reminded her upon being called to vi&s;it him in the &s;mall-pox, only the day be|fore his death.</P>
<P>This ca&s;e &s;trongly verifies the remark of Dr. Heberden, that this complaint can, in &s;ome in&s;tances, be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;mall-pox only by its quicker progre&s;s to|wards maturation, and the &s;horter duration of the pu&s;tules; a watery ve&s;icle always appearing on the &s;econd or third day from the eruption; and the turn, at the farthe&s;t, taking place on the fifth.</P>
<P>The treatment of it differs nothing from that of the mild, di&s;tinct &s;mall-pox; but it more rarely calls for much attention, and only when a patient may have it very full.</P>

<HEAD>AGUE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a complaint &s;o well known, that it &s;eems unnece&s;&s;ary here to enter mi|nutely into a de&s;cription of it. It is &s;uffici|ent to &s;ay, that it con&s;i&s;ts of repeated cold and hot fits regularly &s;ucceeding each other, with one or more well-days between them; in which interval the &s;ick pa&s;&s;es a high-co|loured urine, that depo&s;its a red &s;ediment.</P>
<P>It, perhaps, partakes more of a nervous affection than other fevers may do, and is known to be endemic in &s;ome flat mar&s;hy &s;i|tuations, but is mo&s;t frequent in the &s;pring and fall of the year; in the former of which it is generally ea&s;ily cured, and is even &s;ome|times &s;alutary. Autumnal agues, on the other hand, e&s;pecially in the country, and among&s;t the very poor people who feed coar&s;ely, will frequently continue a long time, and return again the next autumn; whereby the con&s;titution becomes con&s;ider|ably impaired. In &s;uch in&s;tances the legs are apt to &s;well, and more &s;pecially the belly, which becomes h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d, particularly on the left &s;ide, and has been termed the <HI>ague-cake.</HI> This tumefaction, however, in&s;tead of being a bad &s;ign, as might be &s;u&s;|pected <HI>a priori,</HI> is a very favourable one, and indicates the recovery of the patient.
<PB N="180" REF="026291_0197_0FCFA486B9F017A0">
This circum&s;tance is noticed by Sydenham, and like other ob&s;ervations of that attentive practitioner, is a very ju&s;t one, and was doubt|le&s;s, the re&s;ult of his experience. The hardne&s;s is probably owing to an infarction of the &s;pleen, and u&s;ually &s;ub&s;ides in the cour&s;e of a few months, e&s;pecially upon the u&s;e of moderate exerci&s;e, and a generous diet. It may be prudent, however, to ad|mini&s;ter &s;mall do&s;es of calomel, and after|wards light bitters, adding likewi&s;e chaly|beates, if the habit of the patient &s;eems to require them, and there are no &s;ymptoms of morbid affection of the <HI>vi&s;cera.</HI></P>
<P>It were needle&s;s to enter more largely in|to the &s;ubject, and it is equally foreign from the pre&s;ent intention, to be more particular in regard to the cure of this oftentimes very trouble&s;ome complaint, as it would lead me farther than would be compatible with the de&s;ign of this work. Some notice of it, however, is taken becau&s;e, though no more peculiar to children than the la&s;t mentioned di&s;ea&s;es, yet it may be &s;aid, that there are comparatively very few children who have not &s;uffered by it during the years u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ed at &s;chool.</P>
<P>The ague, indeed, attacks every age, &s;o that infants even under a year old are very liable to it, whenever it rages among adults. It is with a peculiar view to patients of the former cla&s;s that the following directions are
<PB N="181" REF="026291_0198_0FCFA48525607F28">
given, the bark being u&s;ually a &s;pecific for older children and grown people; to whom, however, it is generally proper fir&s;t to ad|mini&s;ter a vomit, and one or more do&s;es of phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>In a &s;tate of <HI>infancy,</HI> the ague is often ow|ing to, or connected with a foul &s;tate of the bowels and ob&s;truction of the gall-ducts, and is frequently accompanied with worms, or &s;uch a &s;tate of the alimentary canal as affords a proper nidus for them.</P>
<P>The <HI>tertian,</HI> or more common ague, at this age generally yields to purges of the ba&s;ilic powder, or calomel and rhubarb, given on the days between the fits, and &s;mall do&s;es of Dr. James's powder on the return of the fever. Should this fail, a vo|mit &s;hould be admini&s;tered an hour or two before the next cold fit is expected, if the powder &s;hould not already have had that effect. In older children, the common &s;a|line draught, taken once in &s;ix or eight hours, will frequently &s;ucceed, as will warm bitters, and medicines that promote and keep up per&s;piration. A linen wai&s;tcoat with fine powder of bark quilted within it, may be worn by infants next their &s;kin.</P>

of white re&s;in in fine powder, mixed with the like quantity of pounded loaf-&s;ugar, taken a little before the cold-fit, and repeat|ed afterwards night and morning. Poor people, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch as live in the country at a di&s;tance from medical help, may make trial of it with &s;afety, and with as good pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s as any other remedy I know of, having found it &s;ucce&s;sful even where large do&s;es of the bark have failed. Such kind of remedies for this di&s;ea&s;e are numberle&s;s; I &s;hall, however, mention another, which, though as anile as any, &s;eems to have been very often &s;ucce&s;sful; and is nothing more than the &s;pider's web, rolled loo&s;ely up to the &s;ize of a child's marble, and wa&s;hed down with a little warm wine and water, or camomile tea, before the cold fit is ex|pected: the child &s;hould then be put into a warm bed, and per&s;piration be encoura|ged.</P>
<P>Crude &s;alt ammoniac, in the do&s;e of ten or twelve grains, for children of five or &s;ix years of age, has &s;ometimes cured this trou|ble&s;ome complaint; but may not be proper for delicate con&s;titutions.

three hours, during the fever. Pepper, and likewi&s;e alum, are frequently given with &s;ucce&s;s at this age, the former from five to ten grains; the latter from three to five, joined with the like quantity of nut|meg, three or four times a day in the ab|&s;ence of the fev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r.

<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is certainly highly infectious, and one of tho&s;e that never appears a &s;econd time.

The more important ones are, the &s;tate of in|flammation, &s;ometimes inducing peripneu|mony; the quantity and vi&s;cidity of the phlegm; and the &s;pa&s;modic affection, and danger of &s;uffocation; together with the exhau&s;ted &s;tate into which the patient may be reduced by the long continuance of the di&s;ea&s;e.

If the face &s;hould be very livid and &s;wollen, during the fits of coughing, if any ve&s;&s;el give way, or the patient be plethoric, and more than two or three years old, or &s;hould be hot between the paroxy&s;ms, a little blood ought to be taken away, (which is &s;ometimes inexpre&s;&s;i|bly u&s;eful) and a &s;aline draught be admini|&s;tered, every &s;ix or eight hours, till the fe|ver &s;hall di&s;appear. Otherwi&s;e, if none of the&s;e &s;ymptoms attend, bleeding does not &s;eem, in general, to be indicated, but may rather have a tendency to protract the di&s;|ea&s;e, by increa&s;ing the &s;pa&s;modic di&s;po&s;ition, and by weakening the patient.</P>
<P>If there be an inclination to vomit, it ought to be encouraged, unle&s;s the phlegm be brought up with great ea&s;e in almo&s;t eve|ry fit of coughing, in which ca&s;e, nature &s;eems able to accompli&s;h the bu&s;ine&s;s her|&s;elf
<PB N="188" REF="026291_0205_0FCFA5ED13183EA0">
and it will then oftentimes be &s;ufficient to keep the body open by the milde&s;t laxa|tive medicines. But it very rarely happens, unle&s;s in infants at the brea&s;t, that &s;ome kind of emetic is not nece&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the complaint. The di&s;ea&s;e, indeed, ve|ry frequently requires no other medicine, for &s;uch u&s;ually keep the body open at the &s;ame time, which it ought always to be, but not to &s;uch a degree as to weaken the pa|tient. For this purpo&s;e, perhaps, wine of antimony may be as proper as any thing, when it an&s;wers the end, but it is le&s;s cer|tain than tartari&s;ated antimony, and is not always, I think, of the &s;ame &s;trength. The latter is al&s;o rather ta&s;tele&s;s, and will there|fore have an advantage over every other medicine, when we are pre&s;cribing for chil|dren. Two grains of this in two ounces of water, with the addition of a little &s;ugar, is a medicine to which children will never make any objection. From one to two tea-&s;poonfuls, given to a child of a year old, (varying the do&s;e according to the age) will in general, act &s;ufficiently; and may be gi|ven upon an empty &s;tomach, every day, or every other morning, according to the &s;trength of the child, and violence of the di&s;ea&s;e. If the cough &s;hould happen to be more violent at any particular time, the emetic &s;hould be given a little before the paroxy&s;m is expected. Or perhaps a &s;till
<PB N="189" REF="026291_0206_0FCFA5EBB1E909E0">
better method, at lea&s;t in &s;ome ca&s;es, and particularly in very young children, is, to give the tartari&s;ated antimony in &s;maller do|&s;es, together with a few grains of magne&s;ia, or prepared oy&s;ter-&s;hell powder, (according to the &s;tate of the bowels) three or four times a day, &s;o as to keep the &s;tomach in an irritable &s;tate, as &s;hall &s;ecure a gentle pu|king every time the fits of coughing come on. But in whatever way this medicine be directed, it will prove of no &s;ervice if it does not vomit, and mu&s;t therefore be given in a do&s;e &s;uitable to the &s;trength of the &s;tomach, which is exceedingly various, not only at different ages, but in children of the &s;ame age, and of the &s;ame apparent habit of bo|dy. If the tartari&s;ated antimony has any advantage of the wine, it has much more over every other emetic I have made u&s;e of, the ipecacuanha, and oxymel of &s;quills, be|ing exceedingly unplea&s;ant, and the latter likewi&s;e uncertain.</P>
<P>Such a plan is all that will be nece&s;&s;ary in the common hooping-cough; but it has been &s;aid, there are many ca&s;es which will require other means, and demand all the &s;kill of the experienced phy&s;ican. The cough, for in&s;tance, will &s;omtimes increa&s;e not only for days, but for weeks together, and the &s;trangulation be exceedingly alarm|ing. In this ca&s;e, the milk of gum ammo|niacum, but e&s;pecially a&s;a foetida, frequently

proves a &s;overeign remedy, and though ex|ceedingly nau&s;eous, many children will take it tolerably well for the &s;hort time it appears to be ab&s;olutely required; and when they will not, it may be admini&s;tered by way of cly&s;ter, di&s;&s;olved in two or three &s;poonsful of penny-royal, or common water. The&s;e medicines, however, will be improper in the very advanced &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, when attended with hectic heat, hemorrhage, or other phthy&s;ical &s;ymptoms; a caution equally nece&s;&s;ary in regard to the bark, which in the ab&s;ence of the&s;e &s;ymptoms, and after the &s;tomach and bowels have been well clean&s;ed, is frequently very u&s;eful at the lat|ter &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, when the patient has been exhau&s;ted by its long continuance. Upon the &s;ame plan with the afa <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oetida, camphor and ca&s;tor are frequently benefici|al, and have the advantage of being le&s;s nau&s;eous, but I think are proportionably le&s;s powerful. I take no notice of tincture of cantharides, though &s;trongly recommended by &s;ome writers, becau&s;e I have had no ex|perience of it my&s;elf, and indeed have never &s;ound any nece&s;&s;ity for trying it.</P>
<P>It will &s;ometimes be of no &s;mall &s;ervice, to rub the hands, and the &s;oles of the feet, with the compound &s;pirit of ammonia, &s;e|veral times in the day; or the &s;pine of the back, and the pit of the &s;tomach, with oil of mace, (&s;o called) or oil of amber; but
<PB N="191" REF="026291_0208_0FCFA5E932214468">
as the &s;mell of the latter is very unplea&s;ant, it may be di&s;pen&s;ed with where the &s;pa&s;ms are not exceedingly urgent. But when they are &s;o, this oil is &s;ometimes very u&s;e|ful, particularly when admini&s;tered inter|nally, and children of three or four years will often take a few drops of it very well, mixed in a &s;poon with a little brown &s;ugar; from which I have &s;een as evident advan|tages, as from any medicine whatever. In a little child of my own, it immediately gave a turn to the complaint in the mo&s;t violent hooping cough I ever met with, and after almo&s;t every other medicine had been tried to no purpo&s;e; &s;o that from the hour &s;he took it, the complaint was no longer alarming, nor tedious of cure. But frequently, no anti&s;pa&s;modic is equal to opi|um, in this, as well as in other di&s;ea&s;es. With this view, two or three drops of la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|danum, and, to younger children a &s;mall tea-&s;poonful of &s;yrup of white poppies, or to grown people from five to ten grains of the pilula &egrave; &s;tyrace, taken at bed-time, will not only quiet the cough, and remove the &s;trangulation during its operation, and pro|cure the patient &s;ome re&s;t, by which the &s;trength will be recruited, but in many ca&s;es, &s;eems to have a kindly operation on the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf. It is in this way, I doubt not, that the cicuta once &s;eemed to gain &s;ome reputation, but I believe, it is no
<PB N="192" REF="026291_0209_0FCFA5E4F0078458">
otherwi&s;e a remedy for it than an anodyne. From a mi&s;take, however, in this re&s;pect, the &s;trong manner in which this medicine has been recommended by Dr. Butter, has certainly done harm; as I have known ma|ny people depend &s;olely upon it in very bad ca&s;es, to the exclu&s;ion of other remedies evidently indicated, which would, at lea&s;t, have &s;hortened the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>If ob&s;tructions in the lungs be &s;u&s;pected, bli&s;ters &s;hould be applied, and recour&s;e had to gently deob&s;truent medicines; but at this period, the cure is chiefly to be accom|pli&s;hed by a vegetable and milk diet, (e&s;pe|cially a&s;&s;es milk) pure air, and gentle exer|ci&s;e.</P>
<P>The cough after having di&s;appeared for a week or more, is &s;ometimes found to re|turn with great violence, e&s;pecially upon taking cold; but a gentle purge or two, a vomit, and ab&s;taining from heavy food, ge|neral remove it in a very &s;hort time. If the&s;e cautions &s;hould be neglected, the cough will often prove extreme tedious.</P>
<P>The only thing that remains to be &s;poken of, is the proper diet, which for children even of five or &s;ix years of age, ought to be little more than milk and broths. The&s;e are ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, and will afford them much more good nouri&s;hment than any kind of meats, and will &s;it much lighter on the &s;to|mach than puddings, or pa&s;try, the latter
<PB N="193" REF="026291_0210_0FCF895E2AED9BD8">
of which is exceedingly injurious. The objection made by old nur&s;es again&s;t milk, that it breeds phlegm, is utterly founded in a gro&s;s mi&s;take that cannot be too frequent|ly controverted. It has, indeed, been &s;ome|times mentioned by a certain cla&s;s of me|dical people, but the objection is &s;o unphi|lo&s;ophical and unlike objections of think|ing men, that it &s;carcely de&s;erves a reply. Should the milk, however, be found to curdle remarkably &s;oon on the &s;tomach, a little common &s;alt, Ca&s;tile &s;oap, or te&s;tace|ous powder, may be added to it occa&s;ional|ly; or where it can be afforded, a&s;&s;es milk may be &s;ub&s;tituted for cow's. The&s;e light nouri&s;hments &s;oon pa&s;s out of the &s;tomach, or if brought up by coughing fifty times in the day, (as I have known them to be) a child of four, or five years old, will immediately take more of them with avidity, and will be better &s;upplied in this way, I mean by taking a tea-cupful at a time, than by making &s;et meals, or taking a large quantity at once. If the child &s;hould be thir&s;ty, a little apple-water, toa&s;t and water, and other thin drinks, will be plea&s;ant and u&s;eful. Patients treated in this way, will get through the complaint, if not &s;evere, in a very &s;hort time; and where it proves violent, a child will &s;truggle through this long di&s;ea&s;e without any con&s;iderable lo&s;s of &s;trength, or will be very &s;oon re|cruited by a decoction, or cold infu&s;ion of

<P>Remote cau&s;es of this di&s;ea&s;e may po&s;&s;i|bly be the lax fibre of children, the abun|dance of moi&s;t humours natural to them, and the va&s;t &s;ecretion from the bronchial, or air ve&s;&s;els; and perhaps the change of food from milk, which is ea&s;ily a&s;&s;imulated, to one requiring more dige&s;tion.</P>

<P><PB N="197" REF="026291_0214_0FCFA5D68160D050">
The proximate cau&s;e of this complaint is a morbid &s;ecretion of a vi&s;cid mucus in the <HI>trachea,</HI> adhering &s;o firmly to its &s;ides as to impede re&s;piration. The quantity and vi&s;|cid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y increa&s;ing, gradually le&s;&s;ens the dia|meter of the wind-pipe, and if it effect this to a con&s;iderable degree, the di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily prove fatal.</P>
<P>The Symptoms of this complaint are &s;pa&s;|modic, being &s;uch as would be produced by any other matter con&s;tantly irritating the <HI>trachea,</HI> and dimini&s;hing its diameter. They will therefore very much re&s;emble tho&s;e of the nervous a&s;thma, but the complaint dif|fers materially from the common &s;pa&s;modic a&s;thma of adults, in the peculiar croaking noi&s;e made in re&s;piration, (from whence it has its name) and in the violence of the pa|roxy&s;ms; which, however, leave no appa|rent indi&s;po&s;ition, &s;ave a certain dulne&s;s, and a &s;en&s;e of fear, in children capable of ex|pre&s;&s;ing it. The fits frequently terminate by &s;neezing, coughing, or vomiting, and return without any regularity. It is attend|ed with a quick pul&s;e, laborious breathing, a &s;harp, and &s;hrill voice, and a flu&s;hed countenance, which grows livid during the paroxy&s;ms, or fits.</P>
<P>The di&s;order is probably inflammatory in the beginning; and though this period &s;eems to be very &s;hort, yet &s;hould the phy|&s;ician be con&s;ulted as &s;oon as the di&s;order

might be a&s;certained, both emetics and bleeding might be u&s;eful; but after the <HI>croup,</HI> as well as difficult re&s;piration have thoroughly taken place, it would be im|proper to have recour&s;e to any debilitating means.</P>
<P>It does not always &s;eem to be an original di&s;ea&s;e; being &s;ometimes a con&s;equence of bad fevers, and of &s;ome chronical di&s;orders that have reduced the patient's &s;trength. It frequently appears to ari&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;es as the malignant &s;ore throat, only having its &s;eat lower down, and is therefore more dangerous. And it has, in &s;everal in&s;tances, accompanied the malignant &s;ore|throat, as may be known in the early &s;tages of that complaint, by the croaking noi&s;e pe|culiar to the croup; and, I believe, is in &s;uch in&s;tances generally fatal.</P>
<P>It is divided into two principal &s;tages; in the latter of which no method of treatment has appeared to be effectual, but medicine is never more efficacious than in the fir&s;t, if the di&s;order be not combined with &s;ome other, and it be taken in time, though the crouping may be very con&s;iderable. This I &s;aw remarkably exemplified in a little boy of my own, who was nearly cured in two days.</P>
<P>The &s;overeign remedy &s;eems to be a&s;afoe|tida, which ought to be admini&s;tered both by the mouth and in cly&s;ters, according to

the exigency of the complaint; and in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, before any marked inflamma|tion has taken place, may be given very freely. Antecedently to this, however, it may often be prudent to apply a leech or two to the throat, e&s;pecially if there be any per|ceptible fulne&s;s of that part, and a bli&s;ter to the nape of the neck. At the clo&s;e of the complaint, and to prevent a relap&s;e, the bark proves highly &s;erviceable, and will al|&s;o re&s;tore the &s;trength of the patient; re|turning, however, to the a&s;afoetida, if there &s;hould be any threatening &s;ymptom of the a&s;thmatic affection, which is not un|common. Should a patient &s;uffer two or more relap&s;es, to which a moi&s;t air will pe|culiarly expo&s;e him, &s;ome di&s;charge, by a bli&s;ter, or i&s;&s;ue, ought to be procured, and continued at lea&s;t for &s;ome months.</P>
<P>The French writers depend much upon emetics, and afterwards lenient purges; and to prevent a return, advi&s;e aperitives, &s;to|machics and tonics, particularly prepara|tions of &s;teel, and natural chalybeate wa|ters.</P>
<P>I have examined the <HI>trachea</HI> after death in only one patient, in which I found the preci&s;e appearances de&s;cribed by Dr. Mil|lar; the wind-pipe being lined by a tough vi&s;cid coat, &s;o as mechanically to clo&s;e up the pa&s;&s;age.</P>

<P>It may therefore frequently ari&s;e from un|healthy parents, e&s;pecially from mothers who pa&s;s too &s;edentary a life in a bad air, and feed upon a weak and watery diet: from children's food being weak, watery, or too vi&s;cid to be properly dige&s;ted; but above all, perhaps, from bad nur&s;ing, and the child's being left wet, dirty, or expo&s;ed to a cold moi&s;t air,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable, that this complaint is &s;carcely known in very hot climates.</NOTE> without &s;ufficient cover|ing; from want of proper exerci&s;e, and from clo&s;e and crouded apartments.

<P>As it appears to ari&s;e from a general weakne&s;s and relaxation, the indications of Cure are to brace and &s;trengthen the &s;olids, and to promote dige&s;tion, and the formation of good chyle.

<HEAD>SCROFULA, or KING's EVIL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is primarily a glandular di&s;ea&s;e, though in its progre&s;s it attacks the adipo&s;e membrane, the eyes, the mu&s;cles, tendons, and even the bones them&s;elves, e&s;pecially the joints. It &s;eldom makes its appearance before two years of age, nor later than ten or twelve, (except it be in re|gard to affections of the eyes) though there are a few exceptions in regard to the latter period, and it then often proves fatal, by falling on the lungs, or other noble part. It is frequently ob&s;erved to follow other di&s;|orders, particularly the &s;mall-pox, whether taken naturally or from inoculation, but more e&s;pecially the former; al&s;o the hoop|ing-cough, mea&s;les, teething, rickets; and many other di&s;orders already mentioned. Hence, the nature of this di&s;ea&s;e is better under&s;tood, as it &s;o often falls upon weak and tender habits, either originally of a lax fibre, or worn out by previous di&s;ea&s;es; or is gradually brought on by a heavy, indige&s;|tible, and bad diet, or a low, wet, and un|healthy &s;ituation. It is, however, &s;ome|times found to be hereditary, but will very frequently lie dormant for two or three ge|nerations, and afterwards appear with re|doubled violence. It is often attended, or
<PB N="205" REF="026291_0222_0FCF895A90965A68">
rather preceded, with a peculiar look about the eyes, which are generally large, and a thickne&s;s of the upper lip; and &s;ometimes proves a &s;ource of ill-health through life, but is not u&s;ually fatal in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. Long before the external glands become af|fected, e&s;pecially in young &s;ubjects, the bel|ly is ob&s;erved to be hard and enlarged, and after death, the me&s;enteric glands, and even the pancreas have been found di&s;ea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Though this is a very unplea&s;ant com|plaint, and one that does not often admit of much relief, yet it frequently di&s;appears at the time of puberty (and &s;ometimes &s;ooner) e&s;pecially in females; but whether this be owing to the increa&s;ed &s;trength of the &s;o|lids, or to other changes in the habit, na|turally happening at that period, is not an inquiry proper for this place.</P>
<P>Although I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to men|tion this di&s;ea&s;e among&s;t others to which the &s;tate of childhood is liable, I am &s;en&s;i|ble how difficult it would be to point out any thing like an adequate remedy. At its fir&s;t appearance, however, bitter, or mer|curial purges, are &s;ometimes of u&s;e, as are al&s;o antimonial vomits, and &s;ometimes &s;apo|naceous medicines. But when the di&s;ea&s;e is confirmed, lime-water, and decoctions of the woods, together with crude antimony, bark, and &s;teel, with wine, and a generous diet, are, I believe, mo&s;t to be depended
<PB N="206" REF="026291_0223_0FCFA5C6DAEF1C70">
upon as internal remedies; from &s;ome of which, I have &s;een no incon&s;iderable cures effected. But in this, as in other chronical complaints, good air and exerci&s;e are of the greate&s;t importance. Indeed, the ad|vantage of exerci&s;e in this di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o great, that I wi&s;h to lay a very great &s;tre&s;s on it. But then it mu&s;t be daily had recour&s;e to, and, by degrees, be &s;o con&s;iderable, as to render the patient every night &s;en&s;ibly fa|tigued. Thus, I have known riding behind a carriage, (as I have noticed in another work), almo&s;t without the aid of any medi|cine, entirely remove the complaint.</P>
<P>When there are external tumors, I am &s;atisfied that the opinion I have already giv|en to the public, in a larger tract on this complaint, is both rational and &s;afe; and that whenever they are at all di&s;po&s;ed to come forward, they ought to be brought to as &s;peedy a &s;uppuration as is po&s;&s;ible, and be treated as I have there recommend|ed. The &s;crofulous virus when thrown on the &s;urface, &s;o far re&s;embles the cancerous, according to the de&s;cription of the ingenious Mr. Hunter, that it is inclined to &s;pread to a con&s;iderable extent; but as tumors of the former cla&s;s will bear rougher treatment than the latter, I am confident that much benefit may ari&s;e from the u&s;e of external &s;timulants, by &s;topping the progre&s;s of the di&s;order in the neighbouring parts, as well
<PB N="207" REF="026291_0224_0FCFA5C5544AEE58">
as by invigorating them, and thereby di&s;|po&s;ing the ulcers to heal. Al&s;o light fricti|ons with mercury, &s;o as to make it pa&s;s free|ly through the lymphatics of the di&s;temper|ed parts, without affecting the &s;y&s;tem, have in a cour&s;e of time been beneficial, and de|&s;erve to be brought into a more general practice than they have hitherto been.</P>
<P>I have lately had farther rea&s;on to be confirmed in the above opinion re&s;pecting &s;timuli, from ob&s;ervations communicated to me by Mr. Partington, who &s;ince the hints I threw out in the afore-mentioned work, has made u&s;e of electricity with very good effects, in the&s;e, as well as other cold tu|mors and ulcers I had mentioned; which have all healed very kindly, in con&s;equence of this &s;timulus to the parts. When &s;cro|fulous ulcers have been healed, and only &s;ome &s;mall tumors remain, I have experi|enced very good effects from the external u&s;e of as &s;trong a &s;olution of camphor in oil of almonds as can be made, which has di&s;per&s;ed them very &s;oon; and I have found it the be&s;t remedy, and a very &s;ucce&s;sful one, in the cure of the incipient broncho|cele, though enlarged to the &s;ize of a tur|key's egg; and requires only to be very well rubbed into the parts, three times a-day. The patient &s;hould at the &s;ame time take a dram or two of the <HI>tartari&s;ated na|tron</HI> every morning.&mdash;I &s;hall only add, on

the head of &s;crofula, what is very well known, that &s;ea-bathing, alone, &s;ometimes effects a perfect cure. Should the child therefore have &s;everal &s;crofulous tumors, or the habit be conceived to be much af|fected, trial &s;hould be made of the &s;ea, in whatever manner it may be determined the tumors &s;hall be treated, if not di&s;per&s;ed by &s;ea-bathing.</P>

<HEAD>HYDROCEPHALUS, or WATERY-HEAD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS complaint is di&s;tingui&s;hed into the the <HI>external,</HI> and <HI>internal;</HI> in the for|mer, the water lies upon the &s;urface of the brain, over the <HI>pia mater,</HI> but in the latter it is &s;eated much deeper, within the ventri|cles.

I, in which there is mention of one attaining the age of 29, and another, 45 years, who were then both living; the former did not appear to have any enlargement of the head for three weeks after birth.</NOTE> who was then unable to walk, or even to &s;it upright in a chair. From a very re|cent in&s;tance, however, I have learned, that when no &s;ymptoms of <HI>hydrocephalus</HI> ap|pear
<PB N="209" REF="026291_0226_0FCFA5C19E30F160">
at the birth, the water is <HI>&s;ometimes,</HI> at lea&s;t, contained within the ventricles of the brain: and from the circum&s;tance of no children living long with an <HI>internal hydro|cephalus,</HI> but &s;uch who&s;e heads enlarge within a few months after birth, I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect the di&s;order has, in &s;uch in&s;tances, taken place in the womb. The <HI>foetus,</HI> at this time, enjoying only a kind of ve|getative life, may arrive to maturity under &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e; various in&s;tances being met with, in which full grown <HI>foetu&s;es</HI> have had neither head, nor heart, nor lungs. Accu&s;|tomed to the above-mentioned di&s;ea&s;e, we may pre&s;ume &s;uch infants more likely to live for a certain time with water in the ven|tricles, than tho&s;e in whom the di&s;ea&s;e takes place &s;uddenly, after birth.</P>
<P>In the in&s;tance alluded to, the child's head began to be &s;en&s;ibly enlarged when the in|fant was about four months old, and the child lived to the fifth year, unable to walk, or even to &s;upport its head. Upon a care|ful examination of the parts after death, the water, to the quantity of three pints, as I am informed by the &s;urgeon, was evi|dently contained within the ventricles: which were &s;o &s;tretched as to compre&s;s the brain in &s;uch a manner, that it appeared on|ly like a &s;mooth thick membrane within the <HI>dura mater;</HI> and of all the &s;olid contents of

the &s;kull, &s;carce any thing but the <HI>cerebel|lum</HI> remained.</P>
<P>The <HI>external hydrocephalus,</HI> at whatever period it may commence, has always been e&s;teemed a fatal, as well as mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing complaint; but I have been informed, that where the di&s;order has not been very mani|fe&s;t at the birth, bli&s;ters on the head have &s;en&s;ibly dimini&s;hed its &s;ize. The&s;e &s;hould be applied, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, to different parts, e&s;pecially along the top of the head, in the cour&s;e of the <HI>longitudinal &s;inus,</HI> &s;o as to keep up a con&s;tant di&s;charge; which from the good effects in two or three ca&s;es, when had recour&s;e to in good time, may po&s;&s;ibly, in &s;ome in&s;tances, effect a perfect cure: at lea&s;t, the advantages already ob&s;erved are &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the attempt, in a di&s;order hitherto e&s;teemed incurable.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>internal</HI> watery-head it may be proper to treat more largely, though I have nothing really new to offer in regard to the cure. It u&s;ually takes place between the age of two and ten years; is a like melan|choly complaint with the former, and the method of treatment not yet well e&s;tabli&s;h|ed; and as it can hardly be a&s;certained whe|ther any have recovered from it, (the cer|tainty of its exi&s;tence &s;carcely being known but by examination after death,) it is not likely that a very determined, and &s;ucce&s;s|ful treatment will &s;hortly be &s;ettled. It may

probably ari&s;e from falls and blows on the head, or from an original laxity of the brain; from chirrhous tumors and excre&s;cences within the &s;kull; a watery &s;tate of the blood, or a lingering illne&s;s. It appears, likewi&s;e, to be a family complaint in &s;ome in&s;tances; for I have known &s;ix children, born of the &s;ame parents, die &s;ucce&s;&s;ively of it at the age of two years, five of whom were afterwards opened.</P>
<P>The attack is &s;ometimes very &s;udden; but the complaint more commonly begins with the appearances of &s;low fever, e&s;pecially in older children, with debility of the arms, and pains in the limbs, e&s;pecially the upper part of the neck. After a while, the child is &s;uddenly &s;eized with pain in the fore part of the head, and retches: It becomes heavy and dull; can bear no po&s;ture but that of lying horizontally; the pul&s;e becomes irre|gular, but u&s;ually very &s;low; in the pro|gre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e the faculties and &s;en&s;es are impaired, and the eyes are offended by the light; the patient &s;ees objects double, and becomes delirious. As the di&s;ea&s;e ad|vances, the pul&s;e grows frequent, the cheeks become flu&s;hed, the pupils of the eyes are dilated, the &s;tools and urine come away in|voluntarily, and the patient lies &s;leeping, or is convul&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the younge&s;t &s;ubjects, I have known it begin with a cough, quick pul&s;e, and
<PB N="212" REF="026291_0229_0FCFA5B898BF0988">
difficulty of breathing, attended with cir|cum&s;cribed flu&s;hed cheeks as in teething, occurring on every little exertion, with con|tinual fever and co&s;tivene&s;s; and &s;ometimes a di&s;charge from the no&s;e and eyes.</P>
<P>Symptoms indicative of the di&s;ea&s;e at this age, are, a hand often put to the head, or lifted upwards, and waving about; vomit|ings; co&s;tivene&s;s; expre&s;&s;ion of anxiety, and di&s;like to be moved: at other times, an unmeaning look, and marks of in&s;en&s;ibi|lity; the fingers often clinched, and hands tumid; drow&s;ine&s;s; the eyes in &s;ome ca&s;es impatient of light, in others, vi&s;ion is &s;o imperfect, that the child does not regard any object however clo&s;e to them. The pupils are often not dilated till near the clo&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, and patients often hear and comprehend, and take food to the la&s;t, and die &s;uddenly upon the decline of the febrile &s;ymptoms, when they have been thought to be recovering. The&s;e and other &s;ymp|toms, however, laid down as indications of water in the brain, are, in &s;ome degree, common to other di&s;ea&s;es of children, e&s;pe|cialy the dilatation of the pupil, and &s;leepi|ne&s;s, in fevers ari&s;ing from fowl bowels.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, it is difficult to &s;ay if medicines are &s;o often &s;ucce&s;sful as hath &s;ometimes been imagined; for when a pa|tient recovers, it may be &s;u&s;pected he has not had the true di&s;ea&s;e. Practitioners &s;eem

chiefly to have depended upon repeated bleedings; purges with jalap, or calomel; bli&s;ters to the neck or head, and diuretic medicines. A large bleeding early in the di&s;ea&s;e I have thought very beneficial, e&s;pe|cially in children of a robu&s;t habit.

As the <HI>&s;even-days-di&s;order</HI> has, however, made its appearance in this quar|ter of the globe, and may, therefore, at &s;ome future period, become more common, it may be proper it &s;hould be mentioned in a work of this kind.

Ulloa, (Di&s;c.</HI> XI. &sect;&sect; 19 and 20) and <HI>Barr&egrave;re's Voyage to Gui|nea.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 19. The <HI>di&s;ea&s;e of &s;even days</HI> of new|born infants is common in both quarters of America, and equally dangerous in the high, as in the low parts. A great number of in|fants die of it, without any thing preceding that could occa&s;ion it to be &s;u&s;pected. They
<PB N="216" REF="026291_0233_0FCFA5B16C355E18">
are, on the contrary, apparently healthy and robu&s;t, when the di&s;order makes its at|tack in the form of epilep&s;y; and few of tho&s;e who are vi&s;ited with it are found to re|cover. Though this complaint is not alto|gether unknown in Europe, it is neither &s;o common, nor &s;o dangerous.

which being thoroughly clean&s;ed, and made to dige&s;t, may be &s;afely healed up, as I have found in many other affections of the &s;kin.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon, I know, to admini|ni&s;ter a variety of internal remedies, and perhaps they may &s;ometimes be required, though I think I have &s;eldom given any thing more than lime-water, or a decoction of the woods; and a few purges at the de|cline of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>If the complaint be taken early, before it has &s;pread far over the head, and whil&s;t the &s;cabby patches are &s;mall and di&s;tinct, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> may be frequently cured by the &s;ulphur ointment, with a &s;mall addition of the calx hydrargyri alba. And &s;uch a preparation may very &s;afely be made u&s;e of, if the pa|tient be kept within doors, and his body be properly open; as it will be nece&s;&s;ary to rub in only a &s;mall portion, one or twice a day, on the parts immediately affected. But if the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould &s;pread, or has already extended it&s;elf over a great part of the head, the hair mu&s;t be &s;haved off, and the head wa&s;hed twice a day with a &s;trong de|coction of tobacco; repeating this proce&s;s till the &s;cabs di&s;appear, and the hair grows up from the parts they had occupied. Or, in&s;tead of the decoction of tobacco, the head may be well wa&s;hed with the lotio &s;a|ponacea, with the addition of a &s;mall quan|tity
<PB N="224" REF="026291_0239_0FCFA59FF6217F88">
of the aqua kali puri, and the &s;cabs anointed with the unguent&punc; hydrargyri nitra|ti in the place of the &s;ulphur ointment and calx of mercury; the former being a very powerful, as well as a &s;afe application, and may be u&s;ed in any quantity that may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But the complaint is &s;ometimes of long &s;tanding before medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance is a&s;ked, and is not only extended over all the head, but the &s;cabs are thick, and ri&s;e high above the &s;urface, returning as often as they may fall off. I have, however, never failed to cure the common tinea by a method perhaps well known, but too &s;eldom complied with in time, on account of its apparent &s;everity. It con&s;i&s;ts only in well wa&s;hing the head with a piece of flannel, and a &s;trong lather of &s;oap-&s;uds, after it has been clo&s;e &s;haved, and then rubbing in very forcibly the com|mon unguentum picae and a good quantity of the pulvis ellebor. alb. or other &s;afe de|pilatory, for near an hour at a time, always u&s;ing it very warm; and covering the head with a bladder to pre&s;erve the ointment on the part, as well as to keep it from &s;ticking to the cap, or other covering made u&s;e of. When this has been done three or four times, not only the &s;cabs, but the hairs will al&s;o loo&s;en, which mu&s;t be pulled out, however unplea&s;ant the operation may be;
<PB N="225" REF="026291_0240_0FD0DC88177C8ED8">
as it will, indeed, prove a kindne&s;s in the end: but mu&s;t be repeated till all the hairs be taken out, after which new hair will ri&s;e free from &s;cabs, which is a &s;ufficient indi|cation that the di&s;order is effectually re|moved.</P>
<P>There is, however, a &s;purious kind of &s;cald-head, that is &s;ometimes more difficult of cure; but it requires nothing but pati|ence in the u&s;e of one or more of the above remedies, or at mo&s;t, an alterative plan of the flour of &s;ulphur, or of &s;ome mild mer|curial preparation, with the common decoc|tion of the woods, or the Li&s;bon diet-drink. Or, &s;hould the difficulty con&s;i&s;t in getting out the hair entirely, or de&s;troying the di&s;|ea&s;ed glands at its roots, the calx viva may be had recour&s;e to, in one form or other; and is exceedingly preferable to an adhe|&s;ive pitch-plai&s;ter. In a few in&s;tances, the topical u&s;e of the unguent. hydrargyri miti|us has a wonderful efficacy.&mdash;In the &s;puri|ous tinea particularly, it may be proper to open an i&s;&s;ue, or fix a &s;eton in the nape of the neck.</P>

<HEAD>OPHTHALMIA, or INFLAMMATION of the EYES.</HEAD>
<P>THE Eyes of new-born infants are very apt to be inflamed during the fir&s;t three or four days after birth, e&s;pecially in the winter &s;ea&s;on. If it be owing to taking cold, it is probable it has been either im|mediately after the child was born, before it has been given away to the nur&s;e, or very &s;oon afterwards; and on this account, a flannel cap becomes a very nece&s;&s;ary part of its covering before it can be formally dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This kind of inflammation, however, is u&s;ually of very little con&s;equence, and ge|nerally di&s;appears of it&s;elf, upon merely keeping the head warm, or by wa&s;hing the eyes with a little ro&s;e-water, to two ounces of which, in &s;ome ca&s;es, two or three drops of the water of acetated litharge, and a grain or two of white vitriol, may be added. But there is an inflammation to which in|fants are liable, that &s;ometimes continues a long while, and therefore calls for attention. I do not allude to that redne&s;s on the eye, known by the name of &s;ugillation, or blood|&s;hot, which will often remain a long time, return, and di&s;appear again, without the lea&s;t injury to the child; nor to the watery-eye,
<PB N="230" REF="026291_0245_0FCFA595AB3F03B0">
which will &s;ometimes continue for ma|ny months, and even for years. But that which I here intend, is accompanied with the true appearances of op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">thalmia, or in|flammation of the white of the eye, attend|ed with a di&s;charge as in the ophthalmia of adults: it will &s;ometimes get a little better by common means, but &s;eldom remains &s;o for many days together, and generally in|crea&s;es at the end of the month.&mdash;It often &s;eems connected with the &s;tate of the bow|els, and the coming on of a purging will fre|quently cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it.</P>
<P>I have nothing out of the common way to recommend for it;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a more full account of the treatment of <HI>Ophthalmia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> See <HI>Surgical Tracts,</HI> 2^n^d <HI>Edition.</HI></NOTE> nor does it need much to be done, unle&s;s it be unu&s;ually te|dious: in which ca&s;e, the parts behind the ears &s;hould be made &s;ore, in the way I have before de&s;cribed, and be kept &s;o for &s;ome time. Previous to this, it is often nece&s;&s;a|ry to apply a bli&s;ter to the back, and a leech to one or both temples; to keep the body open, and to make u&s;e of the cooling eye-water before recommended. If the child be inclined to a frequent return of it for years, as I have known in very healthy children, it will &s;ometimes degenerate into what is termed the watery-eye; an excellent reme|dy for which is a grain of white vitriol,
<PB N="231" REF="026291_0246_0FCF89526730C6A0">
mixed with as much fre&s;h butter as will form it into a liniment, which &s;hould be put into the inner angle of the eye every night, at going to bed. In &s;ome of the&s;e ca&s;es, however, the ointment of nitrated quick-&s;il|ver has proved a more &s;peedy remedy, and is a le&s;s painful application.</P>
<P>But there is a far more formidable in|flammation, which has of late years been called the purulent ophthalmy, di&s;tingui&s;hed from every other, by the va&s;t quantity of thick matter di&s;charged, and great &s;welling of the lids.</P>
<P>This is &s;o dangerous an inflammation as to require the be&s;t advice on its very fir&s;t appearance. It frequently &s;eizes an infant a few days after birth, without any previous complaint; and &s;ometimes not only de&s;troys the &s;ight, but di&s;&s;olves the eye it&s;elf, in le&s;s than a week's time. I have likewi&s;e &s;een it exceedingly violent in children of four or five years old, but rarely without &s;ome blow, or other accident.</P>
<P>In this di&s;ea&s;e, every thing that may re|move inflammation, and unload the ve&s;&s;els of the part, &s;hould be immediately had re|cour&s;e to. The body &s;hould, therefore, al|ways, be kept open, and if the child be two or three years of age, leeches &s;hould be ap|plied to the temples: &s;carifications al&s;o of the <HI>tunica conjunctiva,</HI> (which generally falls out upon the opening of the lids); bli&s;ters
<PB N="232" REF="026291_0247_0FCFA59404B92EC8">
to the back, nape of the neck, and behind the ears, are &s;ometimes e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary. The edges of the eye-lids &s;hould be kept con&s;tantly grea&s;ed throughout the day, e&s;pecially in infants, that the thick matter may find an ea&s;y e&s;cape. At night, a little of Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lard's cerate may be &s;pread on &s;oft linen, and applied to the eye, and over it a very &s;oft <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, made with the com|pound water of acetated litharge, laid on as lightly as po&s;&s;ible; that by its con&s;tant moi|&s;ture, the eye-lids may always be kept &s;up|ple. But if the di&s;charge &s;hould &s;eem to be confined, or the eye affected, by the weight of the poultice, this application &s;hould be changed for &s;oft linen rage, which &s;hould be frequently wetted with cold bran|dy and water, or &s;ome yet more a&s;tringent lotion.</P>
<P>It &s;hould ever be remembered, that in the beginning of the complaint the taking away of blood is often not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with, (unle&s;s the child be very young, or otherwi&s;e weak) nor to be &s;paringly done. The application of one leech, therefore, to the temple or neck, will have no good effect, though often repeated. Two, three, or even more, according to the age and &s;trength of the child, &s;hould be put on at a time, and a bli&s;ter &s;oon afterwards; which will often do more to conquer the inflammation, than
<PB N="233" REF="026291_0248_0FCFA5926EDC2F70">
mo&s;t other means put together, if had re|cour&s;e to in time.</P>
<P>Throughout the complaint, a&s;tringent and &s;timulating applications are to be made u&s;e of, being not only far preferable to other means, but &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;hould emolli|ent poultices, and merely cooling collyria be, at any time, depended upon, the event were likely to be fatal. What may be the very be&s;t remedy, it may not be very ea&s;y to determine, having for &s;ome years &s;ucceed|ed, and in a rea&s;onable time, by different means. But ever &s;ince I have &s;een Mr. Ware's excellent publication on di&s;ea&s;es of the eyes, I have had &s;o frequent recour&s;e to to the <HI>aqua camphorata,</HI> as recommended by him, in this &s;pecies of ophthalmy, and have &s;ucceeded &s;o well with it, that I am not yet certain to which the decided prefer|ence &s;hould be given.</P>
<P>One dram of the aqua camphorata of Bate's di&s;pen&s;atory, to two ounces of water, will be a &s;ufficient &s;trength to begin with. A few drops &s;hould be in&s;tilled into the eyes, &s;everal times in the day, as well as the lids, be frequently wa&s;hed with it.</P>
<P>The topical remedies alluded to, in the place of the aqua camphorata, are tinct. opii, and the unguentum hydrargyri nitrati, which &s;hould be applied every night at going to re&s;t; the former being dropped into the eye after the lids have been touched with
<PB N="234" REF="026291_0249_0FCF8943F9C3D780">
the ointment. It is &s;ometimes proper to lower and &s;often the ointment with a little fre&s;h butter, and to add a little camphor.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that where this inflam|mation has not been properly treated from the beginning, the eye is &s;ometimes exceed|ingly injured by it, &s;o that even the eye will bur&s;t. At other times, the <HI>cornea</HI> be|comes much thickened, and the pupil more or le&s;s opake by means of one or more &s;pecks which the inflammation has occa&s;ion|ed. It &s;hould be remarked, however, that we &s;ometimes meet with an agreeable &s;ur|prize, at the decline of this formidable complaint, and find the eye much le&s;s in|jured than had been &s;u&s;pected at the time we were fir&s;t able to get a &s;ight of it. And at others, even where the <HI>cornea</HI> has bur&s;t, the <HI>aqueous</HI> humour has been re&s;tored, and being confined by the cicatrice, the patient has recovered his &s;ight. On the other hand, the <HI>cornea</HI> has &s;ometimes been &s;o greatly in|jured, or the <HI>iris</HI> contracted, that though the eye has not been &s;unk, the &s;ight could not be re&s;tored by any means.</P>
<P>From what I have known of &s;ome per|manent inflammations, I have &s;ometimes been much inclined to the opinion of the late Dr. Hunter and others, who after having tried a variety of means, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in con&s;ultation with different phy&s;icians, have been induced to think, that many of the very &s;tubborn

<P>THE &s;tithe is a &s;mall inflamed tumor on the edge of the eye-lids, more common|ly on the &s;ide towards the no&s;e; but there are &s;ometimes two or more at a-time.

<HEAD>DEAFNESS.</HEAD>
<P>CHILDREN are frequently rendered deaf, in different degrees, in one or both ears, by very &s;light colds, and at the expi|ration of a few days the hearing returns, without recour&s;e to any means. It is, how|ever, &s;ometimes otherwi&s;e, and it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to give a little purging phy&s;ic; to keep the ears warm; and to confine the child to the hou&s;e: and where this does not &s;ucceed, the complaint is not a little dif|ficult of cure. Should it ari&s;e from indu|rated wax, it will be proper to &s;yringe the ears with warm water, to which &s;hould be added a tea &s;poonful of lavender or honey-water; and a few drops of warmed oil of almonds may be in&s;tilled into the ears at go|ing to bed. If the&s;e little means fail, warm|er remedies &s;hould be made u&s;e of, &s;uch as the following, which I have found very fre|quently &s;ucce&s;sful:</P>

Deafne&s;s, however, is &s;ometimes owing to the want of a due &s;ecretion of wax, and is then much more difficult of cure.

as any. It has, indeed, been &s;aid by &s;ome writers to prevail very much in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to be often a &s;erious complaint. Such a di&s;order, if it be canker, may be treated as under the next article; but the common canker is rarely trouble&s;ome to cure, except it be among&s;t very poor peo|ple, where a great number of children are crouded together.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes makes its appearance in the month, at others, about the time of teeth|ing; and frequently at the age of &s;ix or &s;even years, when children are &s;hedding their fir&s;t teeth, and the &s;econd are making their way through the gums, which are co|vered with little foul &s;ores, and will &s;ome|times extend to the in&s;ide of the lips and the cheeks. It &s;eldom requires more attention than was mentioned under the article of den|tition, any mild a&s;tringent application, and keeping the body open, u&s;ually effecting a cure; or if it does not, and the complaint makes its appearance at the time of teeth|ing, it will generally go away as &s;oon as the teeth are come through.</P>
<P>The wor&s;t &s;pecies of this complaint that I have happened to &s;ee, has been during the &s;econd period of dentition, when a child has been &s;hedding a number of teeth together, and the rotten &s;tumps have been neglected to be drawn out.

<P>It appears to attack children from two, to &s;ix or eight years of age; u&s;ually unhealthy children, and &s;uch as have been &s;ubject to worms. The whole body often feels cold on the approach of the di&s;ea&s;e; af|ter which a black &s;pot appears on one of the cheeks or lips, and &s;preads fa&s;t; but without any appearance of inflammation. Oftentimes the whole &s;ide of the face is eaten away, together with the lip, &s;o that the bare jaw-bone and in&s;ide of the mouth appear. In the end, the intire lower-jaw falls down on the brea&s;t, and the whole &s;ide of the face is di&s;&s;olved into a putrid

<P>In the cure, internal as well as external remedies are required, and only &s;uch as cor|rect putre&s;cency, and &s;upport the &s;trength, appear to be of any u&s;e. A few drops of the muriatic acid, therefore, taken inward|ly, in an infu&s;ion of red ro&s;e leaves, or in the child's drinks; the &s;aline draught in ef|ferve&s;cence; and in the end, the bark, in do&s;es &s;uited to the age, with good broths, jellies and wine, are the proper remedies. The parts &s;hould be wa&s;hed, and likewi&s;e injected with the muriatic acid in cammo|mile, or &s;age tea, and afterwards dre&s;&s;ed with the acid mixed with honey of ro&s;es, and over all a carrot-poultice. The child &s;hould in the mean time be gently purged with magne&s;ia or rhubarb, to carry down the putrid matters it may have &s;wallowed. By this treatment Mr. Dea&s;e informs us he has recovered every patient except one, &s;ince he had recour&s;e to this plan, which the world is much indebted to him for making public; though fortunately this dreadful complaint does not appear to be, by any means, a common one.</P>

<P>It is a true chronic, or &s;low inflammation, and is often occa&s;ioned by brui&s;es, &s;trains, or lying on damp ground; and is not uncom|monly connected with a &s;crofulous taint of the habit.

<HEAD>PALSY of the LOWER EXTREMTIES with CURVATURE of the SPINE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS complaint has been of late years &s;o thoroughly announced, that it &s;hould &s;eem unnece&s;&s;ary to enter into a minute de|tail of it after the accurate de&s;cription given by Mr. Pott, who&s;e early account and judi|cious treatment of this dreadful di&s;ea&s;e has added lu&s;tre to the reputation acquired by his former publications.</P>
<P>It will be proper, however, carefully to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the &s;imple curvature of the &s;pine, in which a greater number of <HI>ver|tebrae</HI> is concerned, and the legs are not pe|culiarly affected; as well as from a com|plaint pre&s;ently to be noticed, under the name of <HI>debility</HI> of the <HI>lower extremities,</HI> in which there is no manife&s;t change of figure in the &s;pine.</P>
<P>The pal&s;y of the lower extremities is cer|tainly confined to no age, and being at fir&s;t very frequently mi&s;taken in young children for the trifling effect of &s;ome fall or &s;train, is intitled to notice in this work. I have ne|ver met with it, indeed, where it has not been preceded by &s;ome fall or violent ex|ertion, though as Mr. Pott has ob&s;erved, &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ed accidents are &s;eldom much noticed previous to the debility taking place:
<PB N="250" REF="026291_0265_0FCFA56C1072F7D0">
but this is not univer&s;ally the ca&s;e; though it is, indeed, probable, there may be &s;ome predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e, without which no com|mon &s;train would induce &s;o much mi&s;chief in a part continually di&s;po&s;ed to accidents.</P>
<P>The Curvature is generally in the neck or back, though &s;ometimes in the upper part of the loins, and varies in extent and degree according to the number of the ver|tebrae that may be affected. The fir&s;t &s;ymp|tom noticed by children of an age capable of expre&s;&s;ing their feelings, is an increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility, and irregular twitchings in the mu&s;cles of the the thighs. This is &s;ucceed|ed by a di&s;like to motion, e&s;pecially to mov|ing bri&s;kly; the patient on &s;uch occa&s;ions finding him&s;elf likely to fall, his legs getting entangled through their weakne&s;s, and a di&s;po&s;ition to cro&s;s each other, in his at|tempts to &s;tep forward. Soon after this, perceives him&s;elf unable to &s;tand upright long together, and that the legs and thighs have lo&s;t much of their natural &s;en&s;ibility. Matters &s;eldom continue long in this &s;tate, and weakne&s;s increa&s;ing, patients lo&s;e more and more the u&s;e of both the lower extre|mities, till &s;ome are unable to move them at all even in bed; and the&s;e advances of the di&s;ea&s;e are &s;aid to be more rapid in adults than in infants. In the latter, I have par|ticularly remarked that rigidity of the an|kles noticed by Mr. Pott, by which the
<PB N="251" REF="026291_0266_0FCFA56A92E26960">
toes are pointed downwards, &s;o that the heels cannot be brought to touch the ground.</P>
<P>As my intention is only briefly to point out the di&s;ea&s;e, and the propere&s;t means of relief, it is not of importance to enter into a farther detail of the progre&s;s of this di&s;|order, and of other complaints which are induced by it whenever the original di&s;ea&s;e has been long neglected.</P>
<P>The obvious remedy is that fir&s;t happily &s;ugge&s;ted by Mr. Pott, and con&s;i&s;ts only of a large i&s;&s;ue or &s;eton to be made on each &s;ide the curve, at &s;uch a di&s;tance as may prevent their bur&s;ting into one. Where the curva|ture comprehends three or more vertebrae, or joints, the &s;eton may be preferable to an i&s;&s;ue, but if the latter be on any account elected, I &s;hould advi&s;e its being made by the knife rather than a cau&s;tic; not only as being le&s;s painful, but al&s;o for the very ef|fect Mr. Pott has di&s;approved of, I mean, the con&s;equent inflammation before there has been time for &s;uppuration to take place. It may, indeed, be doubted, whether the be|nefit derived from the i&s;&s;ue may not ari&s;e rather from the inflammation and &s;timulus produced on the &s;urface, than from the di&s;|charge, to which, neverthele&s;s, Mr. Pott &s;olely attributes the cure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been a common idea, that the di&s;charge furni&s;hed by an ulcerated &s;urface is the &s;ource of all the benefit that may be derived from ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, un|le&s;s bli&s;tered &s;urfaces be an exception; in regard to which, phy&s;icians have u&s;ually con&s;idered the &s;timulus produced by the cantharides as the chief mean of benefit, e&s;pecially in ca&s;es of great local pain and inflammation. It is, indeed, matter of &s;ome &s;urprize, that thinking men have not more general|ly adopted the like idea in regard to other inflamed &s;urfaces, whether induced by natural or artificial means. It &s;hould &s;urely &s;eem, that <HI>that</HI> &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, or of the parts, by which &s;uppuration is induced, is more likely to be the occa&s;ion of bene|fit, than the di&s;charge of a large portion of the riche&s;t animal juices, which is but the con&s;equence of the other. Thus, in mo&s;t critical ab&s;ce&s;&s;es, the fever is found to abate as &s;oon as the external in|flammation takes place, and the patient in&s;tead of being afterwards benefited by a copious di&s;charge, is not unfrequently hurried by it into a fatal ma|ra&s;mus, when the ab&s;ce&s;s has been large, or im|properly &s;eated. There may be other in&s;tances, in|deed, in which the &s;uppuration, and even the great quantity of the di&s;charge, may be beneficial to the &s;y&s;tem; but it is probable, that this is not in gene|ral the ca&s;e, and much le&s;s in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, which is attended with &s;ymptoms of general de|bility.</NOTE>.

There are no &s;igns of worms, or other foulne&s;s of the bowels; therefore mercurial purges have not been of any u&s;e, neither has the bark, nor hot, nor cold-bathing. Bli&s;ters, or cau&s;tics on the <HI>os &s;acrum,</HI> and the great <HI>tro|chanter,</HI> and volatile and &s;timulating appli|cations to the legs and thighs, have been chiefly depended upon; though there is no appearance of an enlargement of any of the <HI>vertebrae,</HI> or joints of the back, nor of &s;up|puration in the external parts, and therefore no re&s;emblance to the inflammation of the intervertebral cartilages, the p&s;oas ab&s;ce&s;s, or the <HI>morbus coxaris</HI> of De Haen.</P>

<HEAD>CURVATURE of the BONES from WEAKNESS.</HEAD>
<P>CROOKEDNESS of the bones, particu|ticularly tho&s;e of the lower extremities; has been mentioned as a common con&s;e|quence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">icke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and may claim a tran&s;i|tory notice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this work.</P>
<P>The principal inquiry in the treatment of deformities of this kind, re&s;pects the u&s;e of irons for the &s;upport of the limbs, whene|ver the di&s;tortion happens to be con&s;idera|ble. The propriety of this a&s;&s;i&s;tance has, indeed, been doubted by &s;ome practition|ers, as well as their unplea&s;ant appearance been objected to by parents; who have therefore been inclined rather to tru&s;t only to cold-bathing. Friend, however, as I am to the latter, I may venture to &s;ay from experience, that it is likely to be prejudi|cial at the time it is often had recour&s;e to; for by &s;trengthening the &s;y&s;tem, it rather &s;erves to confirm the crookedne&s;s which the bones have already contracted. It is an ad|vantage, on the other hand, that the bones remain &s;oft and yielding as long as the cur|vature is con&s;iderable, if &s;o be the pre&s;&s;ure of the &s;uperior parts be at the &s;ame time duly counteracted. To &s;upport the limbs, therefore, with irons, as long as the &s;oft|ne&s;s of the bones di&s;po&s;es them to yield un|der
<PB N="258" REF="026291_0273_0FCFA56011D05168">
the weight of the body, is certainly a rational intention, and has been very bene|ficial in numberle&s;s in&s;tances. This end ob|tained, the bones being &s;till lengthening as the child grows up, they naturally incline to become &s;traight, and at this time the cold-bath and other tonics are properly in|dicated, and will co-operate to the cure of the complaint. The only care required, is, that the irons be made as light as po&s;&s;ible, and be properly adapted, and that they be lengthened as often as may be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>When a curvature takes place in the &s;pine (without any di&s;ea&s;e of the <HI>vertebrae</HI> or car|tilages) the like method &s;hould be taken. Proper in&s;truments to &s;upport the head and upper parts of the body have been contrived by different arti&s;ts, but tho&s;e made by Mr. Jones appear to be the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Should the bones of the arm be curved, either by accident or di&s;ea&s;e, in this &s;oft &s;tate, rollers and pa&s;te board &s;plints properly applied, will be &s;ufficient to &s;upport, and re&s;tore them to their natural form.</P>
<P>But if the injury extend to the hip and contiguous bones, it will not be manife&s;t at the time, and can be benefited only by the cold-bath, and other general remedies. If this di&s;tortion &s;hould be con&s;iderable, it may, indeed, become a &s;ource of manifold evils in females, as will be noticed in another place.</P>

They are, however, ju&s;t|ly accounted &s;alutary, and do harm only when repelled, or ha&s;tily dried up.

<HEAD>CHILBLAINS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a complaint &s;o well known, that it can need no de&s;cription. It is ge|nerally owing to the circulation of the blood

in the minute ve&s;&s;els of the extremities be|ing checked, by a child having been long expo&s;ed to cold or wet, and afterwards running to the fire in&s;tead of recovering the natural heat by exerci&s;e. If the injury be exceedingly great, as it &s;ometimes is when a per&s;on has lain for &s;everal hours in the &s;now, the circulation cannot always be re|&s;tored, and &s;ome parts actually mortify. To prevent this, if po&s;&s;ible, in&s;tead of bringing the per&s;on near a fire, he &s;hould be immediately &s;tripped, and well rubbed all over, e&s;pecially the parts mo&s;t af|fected, with &s;now, and afterwards with &s;alt and water, and be then put into bed. But I &s;peak chiefly of &s;lighter attacks; on the fir&s;t appearance of which, known by the heat, itching, redne&s;s, and &s;welling of the heels, toes or fingers, country people apply warm wood-a&s;hes between cloths, or rub the parts with mu&s;tard and brandy, which if done in time will both prevent their breaking into &s;ores, and entirely remove the complaint. For the like purpo&s;e, rub|bing the parts with a &s;oft bru&s;h, or &s;oaking them in warm water in which a hot poker has been two or three times quenched, and afterwards rubbing them with &s;oap, or &s;alt and onions, are good remedies; or embro|cating them with the &s;oap liniment, or with camphorated &s;pirit, to two ounces of which may be added a tea-&s;poonful of the water of

acetated litharge. But I have lately experi|enced the good effects of a far &s;impler means than any of the&s;e, and which I have hither|to never found equalled by any of the warm|er remedies; and is nothing more than the ceratum album &s;pread on a large piece of thick, doubled lint to be applied as &s;oon as the extremeties begin to itch, or be painful.</P>
<P>Some children are di&s;po&s;ed to have chil|blains every winter; as a pre&s;ervative a|gain&s;t which, if it be the hands that are lia|ble to affected, warm leather gloves &s;hould be worn, (avoiding woollen, which in the&s;e ca&s;es is unfriendly to the &s;kin) and above all, wearing for a few hours in the day or night, and e&s;pecially when abroad in the cold, oiled &s;ilk gloves, which is the be&s;t preventative both of chilblains and of chopped hands, that has been hitherto known. But if the feet are u&s;ually the affected parts, the heels only may be covered by a piece of wa&s;hing-leather, &s;ecured round the in&s;teps, and worn day and night during the cold months; and &s;hould be taken off only for the pur|po&s;e of rubbing the parts with the bru&s;h or liniments, as mentioned above.</P>
<P>When the &s;wellings are broken, it is com|mon to dre&s;s the &s;ores only with a little ce|rate, and to wait for the return of warm weather, when they u&s;ually heal of them|&s;elves; but by this means, they often re|main

bad through all the winter, and when large, are &s;ometimes not well till the &s;ummer is very far advanced; and I have even &s;een them remain very bad in grown people, at the end of September.</P>
<P>After having attended great numbers in this complaint, I am &s;atisfied that this kind of &s;ore requires applications &s;omewhat more invigorating, being a &s;pecies of mortifica|tion; and though it will not always endure very warm dige&s;tives like many other ulcers, yet when the chilblains are pretty large, a portion of &s;ome dige&s;tive joined with the cerate, is very friendly to them. And I have known &s;ome &s;ores, though very &s;mall, remain long in a very ob&s;tinate and tedious &s;tate after the breaking up of a hard fro&s;t, whil&s;t they have been dre&s;&s;ed only with ce|rate, or other mild, or drying applications, as they are called, and begin to heal imme|diately upon adding a &s;mall portion of &s;ome warm dige&s;tive, and applying a flannel roll|er, without any other alteration in the plan. But if they are &s;pread to any con&s;iderable &s;ize, nothing contributes &s;o much to their healing, as touching the &s;ores every day with bracing and invigorating lotions, par|ticularly diluted &s;olutions of &s;teel, or tinc|ture of myrrhe; which in a very few days will produce kindly granulations in the&s;e, and other cold &s;ores, though of long &s;tand|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="026291_0279_0FCF89348E9D2E30">
When the parts are much &s;wollen, and the &s;ores been long foul, it will be often ne|ce&s;&s;ary in &s;evere weather, to make u&s;e of poultices, of which, tho&s;e made of rye-meal and the compound water of acetated litharge are more active, and therefore preferable to mere bread and milk. If the&s;e are applied over the above dre&s;&s;ing of cerate and dige&s;|tive, and changed twice a day, the &s;ores will heal in much le&s;s time than by any of the common applications I have &s;een u&s;ed; e&s;pecially if the parts &s;urrounding the &s;ore be well rubbed with camphorated &s;pirit.

<HEAD>LUXATIONS and FRACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>INFANTS are not only liable to the&s;e misfortunes by a fall from the lap, but the bones or joints may be &s;ometimes una|voidably injured in the birth. There is in this ca&s;e, &s;eldom any luxation, I believe, but of the &s;houlders, which is not difficult to be reduced, and requires nothing afterwards, but that the limb be kept perfectly quiet. Fractures, indeed, are not quite &s;o ea&s;ily managed, and perhaps happen more fre|quently. The bones are yet but little more than gri&s;tle, and if &s;trained beyond a certain degree, are ea&s;ily bent, or even broken. The former is very readily re&s;tored, but I &s;hall be more particular on the latter, as the &s;ubject is of &s;ome importance.</P>
<P>Fractures in the birth are u&s;ually of the collar-bone, the arm, or the leg, the treat|ment of the two former of which, will in|clude all that is nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved of &s;uch as may happen in other parts.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="026291_0283_0FCFA54E59B6AC10">
The fir&s;t, however, requires very little attention, as it will be nece&s;&s;ary only to draw the &s;houlders back, confining them in that po&s;ture, by two or three pins in the clothes, and to apply a piece of adhe&s;ive, or of the &s;oap-plai&s;ter, &s;pread on leather, upon the ri&s;ing end of the bone, and a larger piece over the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>A fracture of the arm demands a little more attention, but will always end perfect|ly well. The difficulty con&s;i&s;ts in keeping the fractured ends of the bones oppo&s;ed to each other, without rolling up the arm &s;o tight as to occa&s;ion pain, or much &s;welling of the hand, which in a new-born infant, a very &s;mall pre&s;&s;ure will effect. I have found no method &s;o well adapted as the following, which allowing of a little tumor about the fractured part, without the nece&s;&s;ity of loo&s;|ening the roller, pre&s;erves the ends of the bones in due contact, without drawing the roller &s;o tight as to prevent the free return of blood from the inferior parts of the limb.</P>
<P>To this end, three little &s;plints, about half an inch in width, and an inch and a half long, may be made of fine linen cloth, five or &s;ix times folded together, to the thickne&s;s of common pa&s;teboard; and being &s;oaked in a mixture of flour and white of egg, &s;hould be placed in the u&s;ual manner, along the fractured ends of the bone. Being applied
<PB N="269" REF="026291_0284_0FCFA548DFCEBB10">
wet, they will accommodate them&s;elves ex|actly to the figure of the limb, and when become dry, will be &s;ufficiently &s;trong to &s;up|port the bones. They &s;hould be applied im|mediately on the &s;kin, without the interven|tion of a roller, by which means, when the parts &s;well, which they &s;hould always do a little, there will be &s;pace enough between them to allow of it, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;&s;ure from the roller, which &s;hould be applied over them. This ought to be of very fine flannel, and &s;hould not be drawn near &s;o tight as for adults, nor will there be occa&s;ion for it, as the chief dependance ought to be on fa&s;tening the arm down clo&s;e to the &s;ide, by &s;trong pins fixed into the lit|tle gown, in the manner the &s;urgeon may be&s;t contrive at the time. The gown, there|fore, ought not to be changed, nor the arm moved but in his pre&s;ence; and if the hand is not inflamed, nor very much &s;welled, and the child is ea&s;y, the part will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> need to be opened under eight or ten days. Till this time, the &s;ame gown &s;hould be worn, and be pre&s;erved clean by &s;uch coverings as may ea&s;ily be removed. The &s;peedy union of the bones will depend upon a &s;trict atten|tion to keeping the limb as &s;till as po&s;&s;ible; and if it be &s;o pre&s;erved, the accident will af|ford very little trouble after the fir&s;t ten or twelve days, and at the month's end, the

<P>It is very common for nur&s;es, e&s;pecially during the month, to &s;upport the lower-jaw of an infant whenever it happens to yawn, in the apprehen&s;ion the jaw might, otherwi&s;e, be di&s;located. This practice is, at lea&s;t, an evidence of the nur&s;es attention, and can do no harm, though I have, in|deed, never known the accident happen. Should it, however, take place, either at this age, or in older children through &s;ome violence, it will occa&s;ion a very awkward appearance, and prove very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the child, who will be di&s;abled from taking any nouri&s;hment till the luxation be reduced. Nothing more, however, is required to this end, than to place the thumb of each hand in the back part of the mouth, and the fin|gers on the out&s;ide, under the jaw, &s;o as to depre&s;s, and at the &s;ame time bring it a lit|tle forward, to di&s;engage the head of the condyle, and then force the jaw &s;uddenly back.</P>

<HEAD>OF the VENOM of INSECTS and of CER|TAIN ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the following accidents, like &s;ome others before mentioned, are not confined to any age, they are, at lea&s;t more formidable when they fall to the lot of lit|tle children. It is hoped, therefore, it will not be thought trifling, to recommend &s;ome &s;uitable antidote again&s;t the bite, or &s;ting of venemous in&s;ects, particularly the wa&s;p, gnat, and other flies; e&s;pecially as they happen frequently to children in the coun|try, at a great di&s;tance from medical help, and often alarm parents exceedingly. Indeed, for the mo&s;t venemous, &s;uch help can rarely be had before con&s;iderable inflammation has taken place; after which it will take its cour&s;e, and will continue, if occa&s;ioned by a gnat, three days, and by &s;ome other in&s;ects, for &s;ix; though the tormenting itching may be allayed much &s;ooner by the means of proper applications. If the bite &s;hould be on the eye-lid, the in&s;ide of the lip, or ear, very trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms may follow, and the infant will be vexed by it exceedingly.</P>
<P>In the ab&s;ence of better remedies, the

Under the painful impre&s;&s;ions of an awful accident that happened in my own family, at the time I was engaged in this part of the work, (though I thank God, the alarm ter|minated happily,) I cannot avoid dropping a few words on the envenomed bite of <HI>mor|bidly</HI> enraged animals. It is not my inten|tion, however, to advert to the peculiar nature of this mo&s;t malignant poi&s;on, nor to enumerate the many deceitful remedies that have been at different times propo&s;ed with an air of infallibility; &s;ince dwelling long on this unplea&s;ant &s;ubject would ill ac|cord with a tract of this kind. Nor is it my de&s;ign to propo&s;e any new remedy, but ra|ther to lament, that the be&s;t preventatives &s;hould be &s;o ill attended to, particularly among&s;t the inferior cla&s;s of people, to whom this dreadful accident happens oftener than to the rich. And on this account, as well as the &s;ubject being rarely treated of, and &s;eldom falling in the way of any but medical people, (who are often con&s;ulted too late) it is hoped, the intention will apologize for obtruding a friendly caution in this place. For, after a good deal of experience, and much inquiry and reading on this &s;ubject, I am confident, that nothing ought, in any in|&s;tance, to be depended upon, but taking out the injured parts, by the knife or cau&s;tic; which if duly and timely effected, cannot fail to prevent every evil apprehended.

<P>I have only to add, (what it is, indeed, a great &s;atisfaction to be able to &s;ay,) that, dreadful as this accident is where the poi|&s;on has taken effect, it is evident, that only a very &s;mall proportion of tho&s;e who are bitten by animals actually enraged, receive any injury from it. Fortunately, the clothes &s;ometimes prove a defence, by wiping off the foam from the animal's teeth; at others, it does not happen to be forced into the wound, or is not yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a poi&s;on|ous quality; or la&s;tly, it is not ab&s;orbed, or the &s;y&s;tem may not be in a &s;tate to be in|fected.

<P>It is, doubtle&s;s, the uncertainty of the ef|fects attending &s;uch injuries, that has &s;upport|ed the credit of many fallacious remedies on this melancholy occa&s;ion.

or di&s;colouration of the &s;kin, but is attended with a perceptible pul&s;ation of the brain, which &s;ynchronizes with the pul&s;e.

Where the defect of o&s;&s;ification is very con|&s;iderable, a much larger portion of brain is con&s;equently protruded, which &s;trictly &s;peak|ing, it were le&s;s proper to call a di&s;ea&s;e, than a fatal mal-formation, as it is pertinent|ly remarked by Mons.

is occa&s;ioned by long compre&s;&s;ion in the birth, is of different &s;izes, and the &s;kin is always di&s;coloured, but &s;eldom requires much attention, as the&s;e tumors frequently di&s;appear in a few hours. If large, it is common to bathe, or foment them with red wine, brandy and water, or vinegar, and in general they gradually &s;ub&s;ide, though &s;ometimes not perfectly for &s;everal days. Some of them, however, are of more con|&s;equence, and concerning the treatment of which practitioners have differed; the ab|&s;olute impropriety of opening any tumors ari&s;ing from compre&s;&s;ion having been con|ceived of by many. On the other hand, I believe, it may in &s;ome ca&s;es, be really ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in order to prevent a trouble&s;ome fungous &s;ore, and even a <HI>caries</HI> of the &s;kull. The di&s;crimination, however, is &s;ufficiently obvious, &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance being required only where the above remedies and compre&s;&s;ion have had no effect, and the tumor is found &s;en&s;ibly to increa&s;e day after day, which in &s;ome in&s;tances has been the ca&s;e to the end of the month. Such growth is always ow|ing to the extremities of the arteries rup|tured by long compre&s;&s;ion, being &s;till open, and pouring out an ichorous fluid into the cellular membrane, and thereby keeping up and increa&s;ing the original tumor.</P>
<P>Upon opening the integuments, a bloody fluid is led out, and the tumor nearly &s;ub|&s;ides,
<PB N="304" REF="026291_0319_0FCFA687AA1ED258">
which afterwards requires nothing but moderately a&s;tringent applications and pre&s;&s;ure, which &s;hould be continued for a little time after the aperture is clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Another kind of tumor has been hinted, which has a more unfavourable appearance; and of which it may be proper in this place to take a little farther notice. The&s;e tu|mors contain a kind of &s;erum, and are often very large, but without that di&s;colouration of the &s;calp and brui&s;ed appearance, that there con&s;tantly is in tho&s;e la&s;t de&s;cribed, nor do they, indeed, &s;eem to ari&s;e from compre&s;&s;ion; I have, at lea&s;t, &s;een them extending over a fourth part of the head, and rai&s;ed a full inch from the &s;kull, after the &s;horte&s;t and mo&s;t ea&s;y labors. To the de&s;cription before given of them it may be added, that this kind of tumor, I believe, will always &s;ub&s;ide very kindly, though &s;ometimes not completely, for &s;everal weeks. It u&s;ually begins to le&s;&s;en, however, in &s;ix or eight days after birth; and as it &s;ub&s;ides, more and more of the &s;kull may be felt, from day to day, in proportion as the ab|&s;orption of the fluid takes place. To a&s;&s;i&s;t nature, therefore, in this operation, em|brocations of vinegar, crude &s;al ammoniac and camphorated &s;pirit &s;hould be made u&s;e of; with a gentle compre&s;&s;ion of the part, as well as keeping the bowels properly open.</P>

<HEAD>LVMPHATIC TUMORS on the HEAD and SPINE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is another kind of tumor ap|pearing &s;ometimes on the head, and at others, on &s;ome part of the &s;pine, which is not owing to accidents in the birth, but is of a morbid nature. The&s;e tumors con|tain a lymph, and are attended with evident fluctuation, as may be di&s;cerned by the touch; and unle&s;s they are exceedingly &s;mall, ought in no ca&s;e, I believe, to be punctured, or even removed by ligature, though adhering only by a &s;mall pedicle.

<HEAD>SPINA BYFIDA and PARENCHYMATOUS TUMORS.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Spina byfida</HI> is too well known to require much to be &s;aid upon it. It is a fatal mal-formation, and &s;eldom admits even of much temporary relief, though &s;ome evils may be prevented by pointing out the mo&s;t innocent applications.</P>
<P>It is of two kinds, open and occult. They both ari&s;e from deficiency of bone in &s;ome part of the &s;pine, u&s;ually about the loins, or <HI>os &s;acrum.</HI> The ulcerated ones are of a deep red colour, and in figure and &s;ize re&s;emble the mouth when the lips are drawn together, and the angles brought to|wards the centre. When the <HI>&s;pina by&s;ida,</HI> is occult, or the &s;kin is yet intire, it is of a &s;carlet, or &s;ublivid hue, the tumor une|qual, pretty firm in &s;ome parts, and in o|thers rai&s;ed into little ve&s;icles, and often re|&s;embles a cancer ju&s;t about to break into a &s;ore. It is well known, that in this &s;tate, the &s;kin ought not to be opened, as it would certainly ha&s;ten the death of the infant. On the other hand, every mean &s;hould be made u&s;e of to prevent the &s;kin from giving way, which &s;hould therefore be dre&s;&s;ed with cool|ing, a&s;tringent and drying applications, in the form of lotions and powders, and the
<PB N="307" REF="026291_0322_0FCFA680D0AFC638">
part afterwards covered with a &s;aturnine ce|rate; which are likewi&s;e the propere&s;t ap|plications afterwards, as well as for that which is open from the birth, and will, at lea&s;t, afford &s;ome ea&s;e, as well as tend to prolong the life of the child. Such treat|ment is al&s;o the more proper, from the hope that the tumor, whil&s;t occult, may po&s;&s;ibly be of the more benign kind, now to be noticed.</P>
<P>The&s;e I have termed <HI>parenchymatous</HI> tu|mors; they appear on different parts of the &s;pine, but more commonly near the neck or <HI>os &s;acrum,</HI> are accounted <HI>marks,</HI> and &s;ome|times, it has been &s;aid, re&s;emble the <HI>&s;pin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> byfida,</HI> but are not always of &s;uch a morbid nature as to prove certainly fatal, though it is probable, they all might, if left to them&s;elves. As I de&s;ign, however, to treat only of &s;uch as will admit of &s;ome remedy, I &s;hall mention only two.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is a tumor on &s;ome of the <HI>verte|brae,</HI> u&s;ually of the neck, or the fir&s;t of the back; it is of a &s;ublivid hue, unequal, in|ternally &s;pongy, and very va&s;cular. I &s;aw one of this kind &s;ome years ago, in con&s;ul|tation with the late Sir Cae&s;ar Hawkins, who advi&s;ed to pre&s;erve the &s;kin unbroken, as long as it &s;hould be po&s;&s;ible, which he feared was all that could be done for it; and to this end, recommend the free u&s;e of the compound water of acetated litharge.
<PB N="308" REF="026291_0323_0FCFA67F85C4F1A8">
It was then about the &s;ize of a crown-piece, and not rai&s;ed very much above the level of the &s;urrounding parts. The tumor, how|ever, increa&s;ed, and the &s;kin not long af|terwards gave way, and the child became ill; in con&s;equence of which the late Dr. Hunter was de&s;ired to give his opinion, who advi&s;ed the tumor to be taken out, as the only chance for pre&s;erving the child's life: but the father di&s;approved of the operation. The part &s;oon began to bleed a good deal at times; in order to &s;uppre&s;s which, as well as to le&s;&s;en the tumor, which was now con&s;iderably more prominent, I &s;prinkled it with the following powder, R. <HI>Bol. Armen. pulv. Catechu a~</HI> &dram;ij. <HI>Allumin. rup.</HI> &ounce;j. <HI>Mi&s;ce.</HI> Over this, compre&s;&s;es wetted as above were applied frequently through the day. The&s;e would &s;ometimes adhere for &s;everal days owing to the blood and powder forming a &s;ort of pa&s;te, till a fre&s;h oozing from the ve&s;&s;els loo&s;ened them; at which time the bleeding returned, and the applications were repeated: by the continuance of which, however, for &s;even or eight weeks, and compre&s;&s;ion with a piece of thin lead, the ve&s;&s;els gradually &s;hrunk, and the di&s;charge being dried up, the part was happily &s;kin|ned over, and the child recovered its health.</P>
<P>I have lately &s;een another tumor of this kind, which was treated in a different man|ner. It was &s;eated on the la&s;t <HI>vertebrae</HI> of
<PB N="309" REF="026291_0324_0FCFA67ACF8B2FE0">
the back, and was apprehended to be the true <HI>Spina byfida:</HI> but as no part of the bone could be felt, nor the tumor by pre&s;|&s;ure, be made to recede, I hoped it might be otherwi&s;e, and ventured to advi&s;e taking it off, as the only chance the infant had for its life. This was accordingly done when the child was about eight days old, and though a good deal of blood was lo&s;t in the operation, from a deep &s;eated artery, the &s;ore at the end of the month was per|fectly healed, and the child &s;oon after|wards became as healthy as any other in the family&punc;</P>

That there are blemi&s;hes which bear a re&s;emblance to various objects around us, daily experience has proved; though the true occa&s;ion of them is not, perhaps, under|&s;tood. The like deviations from the ordi|nary cour&s;e is ob&s;erved, not only in other animals, but al&s;o in the vegetable kingdom, fruits being often joined together, and other|wi&s;e &s;trangely mis&s;haped, which mu&s;t ari&s;e from the common laws of nature being &s;ome-wi&s;e diverted from their u&s;ual cour&s;e, by &s;ome accidental cau&s;e equally unknown to us.

<P>Among&s;t the various <HI>Marks</HI> re&s;embling &s;ome of the objects around us, that called the <HI>Hare-lip</HI> is the mo&s;t common; a ble|mi&s;h too well known to require any de&s;crip|tion. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that it is of two kinds; the &s;imple, wherein the upper lip only is divided, either wholly or in part, with &s;ome lo&s;s of &s;ub&s;tance; and the com|plex, in which the fi&s;&s;ure of the lip is double; and &s;ometimes the palate of the mouth, and even the <HI>uvula</HI> is divided.

<P>Various con&s;iderations contribute to make the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed parents &s;olicitous to have this
<PB N="315" REF="026291_0330_0FCFA674DB25D058">
blemi&s;h removed &s;oon after the infant is born, or at farthe&s;t before the month &s;hall be expired. On this account I am convinc|ed, the operation has &s;ometimes been pre|maturely performed, contrary to the better judgment of the operator, and not a few children have thereby fallen a &s;acrifice; whil&s;t others have received much le&s;s bene|fit than they would have done, had the ope|ration been po&s;tponed for a rea&s;onable time. Where the blemi&s;h is very trifling, indeed, and the operation &s;imple, it may be done with rea&s;onable &s;afety in the cour&s;e of the month, or a little after; and if the child be able to &s;uck, which is not always the ca&s;e, there are even &s;ome advantages in perform|ing it &s;ooner. For as the child will not be able to take the brea&s;t for two days at lea&s;t after the operation, it will with difficulty be kept tolerably quiet by the &s;poon after it has been once put to the brea&s;t; but as in|fants need but very little nouri&s;hment for the fir&s;t days after birth, and generally &s;leep a good deal, if the operation be done twenty-four hours after the child is born, it will be in a condition to &s;uck by the time it requires much nouri&s;hment, and the mother's brea&s;t is prepared to furni&s;h it. But in the com|plex hare-lip the ca&s;e is exceedingly diffe|rent, and the longer the operation is po&s;t|poned, the better it is likely to &s;ucceed, and
<PB N="316" REF="026291_0331_0FD0DC9474CA86C0">
&s;hould at lea&s;t be deferred till the child &s;hall be four or five months old; the good effects of which I have lately &s;een in a child born at the <HI>Lying-in</HI> ho&s;pital. By this time al&s;o, the infant will have got over the period in which it is mo&s;t liable to &s;ome painful and dangerous complaints; will be thoroughly weaned from its hankering after the brea&s;t, and have learned to feed contentedly with the &s;poon; by which children with this kind of hare-lip are obliged to be &s;upported, they being always unable to &s;uck. At this period likewi&s;e, the parts will have acquir|ed a degree of firmne&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to retain the needles, as well as &s;ize that will admit of handling them to greater advantage; for the want of which, though the operation may appear to have been favourably per|formed, the needles will &s;ometimes break out, and the deformity be but little remov|ed, or perhaps &s;ometimes be increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have once &s;een another blemi&s;h of the mouth in a child born at the ho&s;pital, which required a &s;imilar operation. In this infant, the mouth was much wider on one &s;ide than on the other, and appeared as if that &s;ide had been divided far into the cheek, which gave it a very awkward appearance; but as it was capable of being remedied in the &s;ame manner as the hare-lip, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that when I withdrew the pins on the third
<PB N="317" REF="026291_0332_0FCFA672953BAF28">
day, the parts adhered very firmly, and the child left the ho&s;pital at the u&s;ual time.</P>
<P>A different kind of blemi&s;h con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ome &s;uperfluous part. Such may &s;ometimes adhere only by a &s;mall ba&s;e, like a thread, and may be removed by only pa&s;&s;ing a tight ligature round them. But &s;hould any even adhere more firmly, and be only a &s;mall joint, &s;uch as a finger or a toe, it were better to have it cut off on the fir&s;t days; as the ve&s;|&s;els will then bleed but little, and the gri&s;tle by which &s;uch joints are u&s;ually connected, are not yet become bony. But &s;hould the part be more completely formed, it may be|nece&s;&s;ary to delay the operation awhile longer, that by di&s;covering which of the duplicates may take the lead, the more pro|mi&s;ing one may be pre&s;erved; which is not always to be known with certainty, at the birth.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the&s;e, there are blemi&s;hes of far greater importance, &s;ome of which demand an operation as the only chance for pre|&s;erving the life of the infant. Such are im|perforations of the <HI>anus</HI> and <HI>urethra,</HI> or the <HI>vagina</HI> in females.</P>
<P>The Vagina is &s;ometimes imperforate on the <HI>external,</HI> at others, only in the more <HI>internal</HI> parts; and is in different degrees. The latter more commonly relates only to the hymen, which requiring an operation to be performed about the age of puberty,
<PB N="318" REF="026291_0333_0FCFA670E6B66A68">
I &s;hall do more than barely mention here, e&s;pecially as it requires only a &s;imple, or crucial inci&s;ion. Where the imperforation is in the &s;ub&s;tance of the <HI>vagina</HI> it&s;elf, I have never found an operation to be of any u&s;e, though I have known it attempted, in the adult, with great addre&s;s and re&s;olution.</P>
<P>I have never met with the <HI>external</HI> parts totally imperforate, but have known the aperture &s;o very &s;mall as to require a little operation, which is mighty ea&s;ily done with the point of a lancet; there being always a <HI>raph&egrave;,</HI> or line, directing the extent nature has &s;eemed originally to intend, which be|ing through, requires only to be kept apart for a few days, by a bit of fine lint.</P>
<P>The imperforate ANUS is a melancholy ca&s;e, as it &s;eldom allows of an effectual re|medy, the gut often terminating in a <HI>cul de &s;ac</HI> &s;o high up as not to be reached; it is not, however, always to be de&s;paired of, though no fluctuation of the inte&s;tinal con|tents &s;hould be felt for two or three days after the infant is born.</P>
<P>I remember only one ca&s;e of this kind in the <HI>Lying-in</HI> ho&s;pital, and in that I hap|pened to &s;ucceed, contrary, indeed, to all expectation, and after the child had puked up a great quantity of meconium; and not only the belly, but al&s;o the face was exceed|ingly tumid, and the eyes had not been opened for &s;ome time.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="026291_0334_0FCFA66C8DCD10D8">
The manner of doing this operation mu&s;t, in different ca&s;es, depend &s;o much on the di&s;cretion of the operator, that I &s;hall do no more than de&s;cribe that which I made u&s;e of in the in&s;tance alluded to.</P>
<P>The operation was not determined upon till the third day. A longitudinal inci&s;ion was made, of about half an inch, above and below the part where the <HI>anus</HI> ought to have been, which was marked by a little ex|cre&s;cence; a &s;mall bi&s;toury was then thru&s;t up in the u&s;ual direction of the bowel, for more than an inch. No meconium following this puncture, I examined carefully with my finger, and feeling &s;omething like the fluctation meconium would make, I intro|duced a trochar, and withdrawing my finger, I carried up the in&s;trument in &s;uch a direction as to avoid injuring the bladder, or forcing it again&s;t the <HI>os coccygis,</HI> for near an inch farther, making allowance, however, for the yielding of the parts, which might be &s;omewhat forced up by the trochar. The in|&s;trument having now pa&s;&s;ed forwards, with|out that re&s;i&s;tance it had hitherto met with, gave me the &s;en&s;ation of having entered a cavity, when withdrawing the trochar, we had the &s;atisfaction of finding the meconium run out at the canula. The child was now put into a warm-bath, up to the wai&s;t, and in a few minutes having voided a con&s;idera|ble quantity of meconium, it opened its
<PB N="320" REF="026291_0335_0FCF898235798788">
eyes, looked cheerfully about it, and fell into a plea&s;ant &s;leep before it was taken out of the bath.</P>
<P>A piece of bougie was occa&s;ionally intro|duced, and &s;ometimes left in the part, for a few hours, for the fir&s;t fortnight; after which the child recovered fa&s;t, and at the u&s;ual time was taken from the ho&s;pital in pretty good health, though it had been much reduced by a bad thru&s;h, which un|fortunately made its appearance &s;oon after the operation; but it always voided its &s;tools perfectly well.</P>
<P>The imperforate Penis is not quite &s;o common a ca&s;e; but is not unfrequently &s;u&s;pected, when the end of the pa&s;&s;age is merely &s;topped up by a little mucus; and &s;hould therefore be examined in good time. In this ca&s;e, wa&s;hing the part with warm milk and water, or at mo&s;t, a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance with a &s;mall probe, or any &s;uch blunt pointed in&s;trument, will be &s;ufficient to open the pa&s;&s;age. But it is evident, if the <HI>urethra</HI> be wanting no operation at all can be per|formed: it is, however, more commonly found open a certain way, and often as far as the ba&s;is of the <HI>glans,</HI> and &s;ometimes near to its extremity; in which la&s;t in|&s;tance, it is nece&s;&s;ary only to make a &s;mall aperture with a lancet, or a fine trochar, and to keep the part open by the occa&s;ion|al introduction of a bougie. The more
<PB N="321" REF="026291_0336_0FCFA66B2EA53920">
common complaint of this part however, is that of the urinary pa&s;&s;age terminating by a &s;mall aperture at a little di&s;tance below the <HI>glans,</HI> and &s;ometimes on one &s;ide of it. In the&s;e ca&s;es, the preci&s;e circum&s;tances mu&s;t determine the propriety of any opera|tion, which if not carefully managed, may render the ca&s;e wor&s;e than it was. I re|collect two indeed, in which I was able to do con&s;iderable &s;ervice, one of which was in the pre&s;ence of the late Sir Cae&s;ar Haw|kins, and the other of the late Dr. Hunter; in the latter, the urine was di&s;charged from one &s;ide of the <HI>penis,</HI> and pretty low down, which was very happily remedied.</P>
<P>There are other mal-formations of this part, by which it is drawn downwards, or to one &s;ide; the peculiar circum&s;tances of which, mu&s;t point out the nature of the operation mo&s;t likely to afford relief. This will generally con&s;i&s;t in a &s;imple inci&s;ion of the &s;kin, where it may happen to be too tight or &s;hort, and keeping the divided ed|ges at a di&s;tance from each other, till the little &s;ore &s;hall be healed.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e known the Ears to be im|perforate, a ca&s;e that allows of no re|medy; but the external appearance may &s;ometimes be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, when the <HI>helix,</HI> or outer circle, is turned forwards over the <HI>tragus,</HI> covering that part which ought to lead to the internal ear; but in the&s;e ca&s;es,
<PB N="322" REF="026291_0337_0FCFA669A217D820">
I have always found the <HI>concha,</HI> and <HI>meatus auditorius,</HI> totally obliterated.</P>
<P>Another, and a very common blemi&s;h, is that called Squinting, which is &s;ometimes contracted by very young infants, and may then frequently be remedied, e&s;pecially if confined to one eye; but if a child be born with this deformity, it is not &s;o likely to be removed. The means I have to recom|mend are, indeed, very &s;imple, and con|&s;i&s;t only in applying a piece of &s;ticking-plai&s;ter &s;pread on &s;ome bright coloured &s;ilk, in &s;uch a po&s;ition, either on the temple, or the no&s;e, agreeably to the &s;ide on which the eye is di&s;torted, as may draw it the con|trary way. In order to keep up this at|traction, the colour of the &s;ilk ought to be varied from time to time, as well as its &s;itu|ation, placing it a little higher, or lower, both for the &s;ake of change, as well as to an&s;wer any other end, that a due ob&s;erva|tion on its effects may point out. Be&s;ides this, the child ought always to be placed with that &s;ide towards the light from which the eye is di&s;torted; and for the like rea&s;on, its parents, nur&s;e, play-things, and every other object that can attract its notice, &s;hould as con&s;tantly as is po&s;&s;ible be on the &s;ame &s;ide, that the child may have every inducement it, age and circum&s;tances will allow, to draw the eye the right way, and
<PB N="323" REF="026291_0338_0FCFA6682634C300">
by early habit, counteract a mu&s;cular action that is not yet become permanent.</P>
<P>Another method more proper for older children, is covering the eyes with ogles, which are gla&s;&s;es fixed in a little ca&s;e, &s;uch as many people wear when they ride on hor&s;eback. They mu&s;t be &s;o placed, that the child can &s;ee no object but by turning the eyes to the &s;ides from which they are di&s;torted. It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to add, that the gla&s;&s;es mu&s;t be worn con&s;tantly, till the bad habit is overcome.</P>
<P>Infants are liable, indeed, to many other blemi&s;hes; but as I mean to treat only of &s;uch as call for medical attention, and ad|mit of &s;ome remedy, I &s;hall mention only one or two more, which are very common, and with them clo&s;e what I have to &s;ay on their Complaints.</P>

<HEAD>VARI and VALGI.</HEAD>
<P>THESE are di&s;tortions of the feet, and differ only with re&s;pect to the &s;ide to which the foot is turned; in the former, the &s;oles of the feet being turned inwards, and in the latter, outwards: the curative intention is therefore alike in both. The complaint is &s;ometimes very trifling, and &s;eems to have been owing only to &s;ome cram|ped po&s;ition of the feet in the womb, and
<PB N="324" REF="026291_0339_0FCFA666A1ACC5F8">
in that ca&s;e, di&s;appears before the end of the month. In other in&s;tances, there is evidently a contraction, if not accurtation of the tendons, which calls for con&s;iderable attention. The remedy, is obvious enough, and con&s;i&s;ts only in the proper application of a roller and pa&s;te-board &s;plints, &s;o as gra|dually to bring the foot towards its natural po&s;ition, and in proportion as it inclines thereto, increa&s;ing the force and tightning the roller, every two or three days.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another very common di&s;|tortion, to which no particular name, I be|lieve, has been given, in which the feet are turned upward towards the in&s;tep: but the mode of treatment is alike in them all, and the cure will u&s;ually be effected in a rea&s;on|able time.&mdash;The like ea&s;y means, therefore, will generally be &s;ufficient to remedy a con|traction of the joints of the fingers, and va|rious awkward po&s;itions of the toes, with which &s;ome infants come into the world.</P>
<P>All the&s;e complaints may, neverthele&s;s, be &s;ometimes more con&s;iderable, and in &s;uch ca&s;e, e&s;pecially if neglected for many months, or even years, as they &s;ometimes are, re|quire the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome &s;teel in&s;trument, or irons, (as they are called,) which are properly contrived for the&s;e and other di&s;|tortions, as of the knees, &amp;c. by Me&s;&s;rs.

<HEAD>GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR THE PROPER MANAGEMENT OF INFANTS FROM THE BIRTH.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER &s;plendor the actual treat|ment of di&s;ea&s;es may reflect on the &s;ci|ence of medicine, it by no means compre|hends the whole of its province: for pre|vention being in every ca&s;e preferable to re|medies, the medical art would be more im|perfect than other &s;ciences, were it devoted only to the latter. In the management of infants more e&s;pecially, &s;uch a variety of other articles occurs &s;ubject to medical di|rection, that this little work would be peculiarly incomplete if confined merely to the cure of di&s;orders. In a view, there|fore, to &s;uch mi&s;cellaneous matters, and certain recurring affections too trifling to be ranked as di&s;ea&s;es, this &s;econd part is an|nexed; and it is hoped, may contain eve|ry thing on which the mo&s;t vigilant parent
<PB N="329" REF="026291_0343_0FCFA66343893660">
can wi&s;h for information, without tiring her by enlarging upon trifles. In all matters of importance a becoming firmne&s;s has been adopted, but I have not equally in&s;i&s;ted up|on others, wherein the manners of a refined age cannot comply, nor have urged any pe|culiar modes which the generality may not adopt. Should any opinion be more ob&s;ti|nately maintained, it is, probably, in rela|tion to the nouri&s;hment mo&s;t adapted to new|born children; and this it may be proper to di&s;cu&s;s, previou&s;ly to entering upon their general management, by con&s;idering the ca&s;e of infants intended to be reared with|out the brea&s;t, or brought up, as it is cal|led, <HI>by hand.</HI></P>
<P>But it would carry me altogether beyond the limits I have a&s;&s;igned to this &s;econd part, were I to enter &s;o far into the inve&s;tiga|tion of the &s;ubject, as to &s;et forth all the improprieties of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> of training up infants from the birth. And I am glad to find by &s;ome very recent examples among per&s;ons of rank, that there is &s;omewhat le&s;s occa&s;ion for it, than there appeared to be &s;ome years ago. It would be unpardonable, however, in a work of this &s;ort, not to in|&s;i&s;t how inadequate every &s;ub&s;titute for the brea&s;t has been univer&s;ally found; and therefore how proper it is, that every child &s;hould have it, and even be &s;uckled by its
<PB N="330" REF="026291_0344_0FCF897AD4065BA8">
own mother, where her health can &s;afely admit of it.&mdash;Rea&s;on, in&s;tinct, experience, all con&s;pire to &s;upport this opinion; and whoever will determine to attend only to matter of fact, may &s;oon be convinced of it. Nature her&s;elf points it out: all the nobler part of the irrational creation is qua|lified for it, and by in&s;tinct it obeys&mdash;the human race alone, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of nobler pow|ers, and rational di&s;cernment, perverts tho&s;e faculties to evade its dictates, and to invent excu&s;es for refu&s;ing its claims. But pue|rile, indeed, are all the common arguments again&s;t it, in the greater number of in|&s;tances; and herein Dr. Arm&s;trong &s;eems to have egregiou&s;ly erred, for though, ap|parently, an advocate for &s;uckling, he has laboured for arguments to apologize for the &s;poon and the boat, in too many in&s;tances. It were ea&s;y, perhaps, to produce as &s;ound arguments again&s;t eating more than once a-day, becau&s;e &s;o many people become di&s;ea&s;|ed from exce&s;s. But not only is the brea&s;t-milk the natural,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;ome very northern parts of the world, as tho&s;e of Greenland, and the neighbouring country of the E&s;quimaux, the brea&s;t appears to be, in the &s;tricte&s;t propriety of &s;peech, the <HI>only</HI> food that na|ture has provided for infants; in&s;omuch that, when|ever a &s;uckling-mother happens to die, her infant is buried with her. Experience, one would hope, having demon&s;trated the inefficacy of the hard and coar&s;e diet which nature has there &s;o &s;paringly dealt out, it is e&s;teeme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> an act of compa&s;&s;ion to put an end to an infant's &s;ufferings by plunging it into the &s;ea.</NOTE> and mo&s;t proper food
<PB N="331" REF="026291_0345_0FCFA65E52143068">
for infants, but &s;uckling al&s;o conduces to the ea&s;y recovery of the mother; though &s;he &s;hould not be able wholly to &s;upport her child by the brea&s;t, or to continue &s;uckling &s;o long as the infant may require it.</P>
<P>Although from much experience I ven|ture to give this opinion, I do, by no means intend to a&s;&s;ert that every mother is able to &s;uckle her child even for the month, or would do well to attempt it; but I am, ne|verthele&s;s, equally &s;atisfied, that many are very well able who do not, and &s;everal who have only through fear been di&s;courag|ed from doing it, in two or three lyings-in, having afterwards been prevailed on to make the attempt, have gone on with it for &s;eve|ral months, enjoyed better health when they &s;uckled than at any other part of their lives, and their children have thriven per|fectly well.</P>
<P>Thus, be&s;ides the advantages derived to infants, there are evidently others re&s;ulting to the mother her&s;elf, and &s;ome that de&s;erve a particular notice. For, by this means, where due care is taken, painful inflamma|tions and &s;uppurations in the brea&s;t may of|ten be prevented, as may be fairly concluded,
<PB N="332" REF="026291_0346_0FCFA65CCEBAEF60">
not only from the rarity of &s;uch complaints in the <HI>Briti&s;h Lying-in Ho&s;pital,</HI> where almo&s;t every woman &s;uckles her infant, but from the like authority of Dr. Nel&s;on, who re|ports, that out of 4,400 women who &s;uck|led their children, only four had milk-&s;ores, and that "the&s;e had either no nipples, or former &s;ore brea&s;ts." The&s;e advantages, if duly credited, one &s;hould hope, might tend to induce ladies of rank to &s;et the ex|ample, by performing this kinde&s;t and mo&s;t plea&s;ant office, at lea&s;t during the mouth. But it would be unju&s;t not to add, that whenever they may purpo&s;e to a&s;&s;ume it for a much longer time, they &s;hould determine to do it effectually, or they will but injure their children, as well as forfeit many of the advantages and comforts, which in a due execution of it, they would have a right to expect. It is po&s;&s;ible, I may not be thanked for urging &s;ome parts of the above advice; but I am certain, I am do|ing my duty in giving it.</P>
<P>Hitherto, however, notwith&s;tanding the the many encouragements often brought to the ears, and urged upon parents, that ty|rant, Fa&s;hion, has prevailed over the good &s;en&s;e and natural feelings of many, who&s;e maternal affection can be, in no other in|&s;tance, &s;u&s;pected. Again&s;t &s;ome, moreover, another complaint may be brought, who not only refu&s;e to give nouri&s;hment to their

tender and helple&s;s offspring, but whil&s;t they, unnece&s;&s;arily, commit this charge to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tranger, give up every other charge with it; and &s;eldom vi&s;it the nur&s;ery, or &s;uperin|tend tho&s;e they &s;et over it.

<P>Another important, and affecting con&s;i|deration might be brought forward on this head, which I &s;hall, indeed, only touch up|on, as it calls rather for the pen of the phi|lo&s;opher than of a phy&s;ician, I mean, the &s;acrifice that poor women make in going out to &s;uckle other people's children, the &s;ad con&s;equences of which are often &s;e|verely felt by their own, through neglect or mi&s;management, and e&s;pecially for want of the brea&s;t. Indeed no attention of the nur&s;e can duly compen&s;ate this lo&s;s; and only the mo&s;t common &s;ub&s;titutes for it can, in their forlorn circum&s;tances, be allowed them. This becomes a &s;ource of evil, that, I fear, is not u&s;ually thought of, and proves eventually the &s;acrifice of many infants eve|ry year: a matter of much importance, in|deed, to the public, as well as to the fami|lies immediately concerned. It is true, in|deed, ladies of rank frequently do all in
<PB N="334" REF="026291_0348_0FCFA659D0A44100">
their power to counteract this too natural, and fatal con&s;equence, by a careful atten|tion to the for&s;aken infant; not only in&s;i&s;t|ing upon a brea&s;t being provided for it, but regarding it as a kind of fo&s;ter-child: &s;o that, after generou&s;ly pre&s;erving it through infancy by their charity and attention, they frequently follow it with their protection and kindne&s;s through life. Such charity, indeed, adds a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> elevated rank; tho' perhaps, much le&s;s than this, from &s;ome people, would be &s;hort of their duty. But it is not every family that is in a &s;ituation to adopt this conduct; though I am &s;orry to add, that too many who are not, neverthe|le&s;s, greedily adopt the fa&s;hions, and mimick the manners of the great, by more criminal|ly and needle&s;sly refu&s;ing to &s;uckle, and abandoning that tender charge with which nature her&s;elf has entru&s;ted them.</P>
<P>It gives me real concern to find occa&s;ion for &s;uch unplea&s;ant reflections upon any part of the &s;ex I &s;o much honour, and upon any of my fair and &s;en&s;ible country women, in parti|cular.

<P>I have, indeed, both at the ho&s;pital and el&s;e|where, met with many in&s;tances of children born with very little, and others without even the &s;mall|e&s;t appearance of life, &s;ome of whom have remain|ed entirely de&s;titute of any &s;ign of it, for more than a quarter of an hour, and yet have been happily re&s;tored.

And this has &s;o often &s;ucceeded, that I have been tempted to think its importance may po&s;&s;ibly, not have been &s;ufficiently attended to by every practitioner. I re&s;t this pre&s;umption, not only upon &s;ome fortunate events where I have had little or no previous ground for hope, but where others had, in &s;ome in&s;tances, abandoned it. A certain &s;teady per&s;everance in our attempts to pre|&s;erve life, is, indeed, not only a duty practitioners owe to the public, &s;o long as the lea&s;t hope may re|main, but one &s;ucce&s;sful attempt is an abundant re|compence for many failures; e&s;pecially, as I ima|gine we &s;hall rarely fail when there may be the lea&s;t po&s;itive ground for hope of a favourable i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>As to the means they con&s;i&s;t only of warmth, cly&s;ters, &s;timulants, and e&s;pecially blowing forcibly into the <HI>trachaea,</HI> or wind-pipe.</P>
<P>The ordinary &s;timulants are the &s;moke of lighted brown paper, or tobacco; juice of onions; Scotch &s;nuff; frictions with hot cloths, and brandy; &s;trik|ing the <HI>nates,</HI> and the &s;oles of the feet: &s;timulating the no&s;e, and upper parts of the throat with a fea|ther; with every other &s;imilar mean calculated to excite a &s;trong effort, e&s;pecially that of crying; to which our attempts mu&s;t principally, and ultimately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. On this account, I believe; no great benefit is to be expected from &s;troking the blood along the chord, or immer&s;ing the after-birth in warm wa|ter; the fetal life being extinct, the recovery of the child will depend on the blood pa&s;&s;ing freely through the lungs, which it cannot do till the child is brought to breathe freely and forcibly; the conti|nuance of which al&s;o is never &s;ecure, till it begins to <HI>cry.</HI> To the&s;e ends, I have depended above all upon blowing into the mouth, which I am &s;atisfied may be more effectually done by the mouth of the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ant being placed immediately upon the child's, than by means of a blow-pipe; at the &s;ame time, prevent|ing a premature return of the air, by the fingers of one hand placed at the corners of the mouth, and tho&s;e of the other on each &s;ide of the no&s;e. But I have &s;ometimes imagined, that I might attribute much of my &s;ucce&s;s not only to the <HI>continuance</HI> of this, but to the <HI>manner</HI> of doing it, by attempting to imitate natural re&s;piration, by forcing out the air I had thrown in, by a &s;trong pre&s;&s;ure again&s;t the diaphragm and brea&s;t: thus blowing in, and alter|nately pre&s;&s;ing out the air, for a long time together, omitting it only now and then, to make u&s;e of &s;ome of the abovementioned means: which latter, how|ever, can do very little till the child begins not on|ly to ga&s;p, and that with &s;horter intervals, but al&s;o to breathe in a pretty uniform manner. At this time, &s;hould the child not be di&s;po&s;ed to <HI>cry,</HI> which is frequently the ca&s;e, the <HI>nates</HI> and &s;oles of the feet &s;hould be &s;tricken forcibly and repeatedly; and this failing, as well as the application of ordinary &s;ti|mulants to the no&s;e, and irritating the wind-pipe, I think nothing is &s;o likely to &s;ucceed as a tobacco, or other &s;timulating cly&s;ter, and putting a little Scotch &s;nuff up to the no&s;e, which latter if it induce &s;neezing, will &s;oon be followed by a &s;trong cry, and the child be with certainty re&s;tored.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other means, that of warmth was re|commended; to which end, the infant &s;hould be entirely covered with hot clothes, which &s;hould be renewed as fa&s;t as they become cool; or the body may be immer&s;ed in a tepid bath, and be well rub|bed all over: the chord may likewi&s;e be &s;uffered to bleed a little, e&s;pecially if the face or body do not &s;oon acquire the natural colour&mdash;but this ought &s;el|dom to be done, nor the chord be divided as long as any pul&s;ation is to be felt in it.</P>
<P>To the&s;e means may be added the cautious u&s;e of electricity, which appears, <HI>a priori,</HI> as likely to be &s;ucce&s;sful in the&s;e, as in any other ca&s;es to which it has been applied: but I have never been in a &s;i|tuation to make trial of it, or I certainly &s;hould, as I once knew a child happily recovered by it, after being laid out for dead, for near two hours, in con|&s;equence of a fall from a two-pair of &s;tairs win|dow.</P>
<P>But &s;hould the&s;e &s;everal means fail, as a la&s;t re|&s;ource, a very different kind of &s;timulant may be tried, and in&s;tead of laying the infant a&s;ide in a warm flannel, it &s;hould be expo&s;ed to &s;udden and &s;e|vere cold, which I remember once to have &s;ucceed|ed after the life of the child had been de&s;paired of.</P>
<P>It will be pre&s;umed, I dare &s;ay, that &s;uch a &s;cru|pulous attention is not de&s;igned to be inculcated in every in&s;tance of apparently &s;till-born, infants, but principally where the death of the child may not only not be certainly a&s;certained, but there has previou&s;ly been rea&s;on to expect it would be brought alive into the world.&mdash;The great importance, however, of the &s;ubject, it is hoped, will be a &s;ufficient apology for the length of this note; and as the attempt to re&s;tore infants to life has always been a mo&s;t plea&s;ing employment, to my&s;elf, the de&s;ire of being an oc|ca&s;ion of inducing others to a <HI>per&s;everance</HI> in the u&s;e of the like means, emboldens me to ri&s;k the cen|&s;ure of any who may deem it prolix or &s;uperfluous.&mdash;I &s;hall ju&s;t add, that among&s;t other &s;ymptoms of &s;ome irrecoverable injury a child may have &s;u&s;tained in the birth, is that of a di&s;coloured and often fetid, or bloody water forcing out of the no&s;e, after the lungs have been two or three times artificially in|flated. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I have very rarely &s;een an infant at all revived; but I have twice lately &s;o far &s;ucceeded as to animate a child &s;uffici|ently both to breath and to cry; but they afterwards lay in a moaning &s;tate for four or &s;ix hours, and then expired.</P></NOTE> who, doubtle&s;s, at this moment,

The cold-bath acts on a quite different principle, and I could wi&s;h almo&s;t every child, e&s;peci|ally tho&s;e born in London, were bathed at three or four months old, (if the &s;ea&s;on of the year and other circum&s;tances &s;hould ad|mit of it)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To this end, particularly, a child &s;hould not be co&s;tive, feveri&s;h, nor have any internal ob&s;truc|tions.&mdash;<HI>Mons.

<P>For the &s;ake of &s;ome readers it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve, that a child is to be put only once under the water at each time of bathing, and to be taken out as &s;oon as it is po&s;&s;ible.

It is <HI>de&s;igned</HI> to be weak and tender in this infant-&s;tate, as is every other object around us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Nons nai&s;&s;ons foibles, nous avons be&s;oin de forces; nous nai&s;&s;ons d&eacute;pourvous de tout, nous avons be&s;oin d'a&s;&s;i&s;tance, nous nai&s;&s;ons &s;tupides, nous a|vons be&s;oin de jugement; tout ce que nous n'avons pas &aacute; notre nai&s;&s;ance, et dont nous avons be&s;oin etant grauds, nous e&s;t donn&egrave; par l'education.</P><P>ROUSSEAU.</P></NOTE>&mdash;Take a &s;urvey of nature, from the fir&s;t opening leaves of the vernal flower, or the tender foilage of the &s;en&s;itive plant, to the young lion, or the elephant; they are all in their &s;everal orders, proportionally weak, and cannot exi&s;t without &s;ome exte|rior &s;upport. But they &s;tand in need of nothing but what nature has prepared for them. If &s;eed be ca&s;t into a proper &s;oil, it wants only the &s;urrounding elements to en&s;ure vigour and maturity. So if the ten|der

<P>It is true, it is very weak, but is it there|fore to be tight rolled, under the idea of &s;upporting it, and giving it &s;trength? It is a bundle of tender ve&s;&s;els, through which a fluid is to pa&s;s, undi&s;turbed, to be equal|ly di&s;tributed through the body, and which are therefore &s;urrounded by a &s;oft medium, capable of yielding to the impetus of their contents. Hence we cannot but conceive, how injurious any great pre&s;&s;ure mu&s;t be to &s;o delicate a frame, which before birth &s;wam in a &s;oft fluid. But be&s;ides this, the infant requires freedom and liberty on other accounts. The &s;tate of infancy and child|hood (as Dr. Gregory ob&s;erves) is impati|ent of re&s;traint in this re&s;pect, through "the re&s;tle&s;s activity incident to youth, which makes it delight to be in perpetual motion, and to &s;ee every thing in motion around it."</P>
<P>Let us again advert to the irrational &s;pe|cies, who&s;e more &s;agacious conduct &s;o often di&s;graces our own. There is no occa&s;ion on which they do not &s;eem to con&s;ult pro|priety; and having a right end in view, they as certainly accompli&s;h it, and always

<P>I am not ignorant, indeed, that for many years pa&s;t, the very ancient tight mode of dre&s;&s;ing infants has been di&s;continued, for which we are probably greatly indebted to Dr. Cadogan. It is certain al&s;o, that for the la&s;t twenty years, the fa&s;hion recom|mended by him has been improving; but there is yet room to go forward, and were every tender parent in this country tho|roughly &s;en&s;ible of its advantages, it would &s;oon become fa&s;hionable to &s;ee children as much at their ea&s;e on a chri&s;tening-day, as they are when laid at night in their beds. And I may be permitted to add here, what every modern practitioner has adverted to, that were &s;trings, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance, &s;u&s;tituted for pins, phy&s;icians would &s;eldom be at a lo&s;s to account for the &s;udden cries and complaints of infants, which are too of|ten

produced by this needle&s;s part of their dre&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A gentlewoman lately informed me, that one of her children, after long and ince&s;&s;ant crying, fell into &s;trong convul&s;ions, which her phy&s;ician was at a lo&s;s to account for, nor was the cau&s;e di&s;covered till after death; when on the cap being taken off (which had not been changed on account of its ill|ne&s;s) a &s;mall pin was di&s;covered &s;ticking up to the head, in the large <HI>fontanelle,</HI> or mould.</NOTE></P>
<P>Nature knows no other u&s;e of clothing but to defend from the cold,&mdash;all that is ne|ce&s;&s;ary therefore for this purpo&s;e, is to wrap the child up in a &s;oft loo&s;e covering, and not too great a weight of it; to which orna|ments enough may be added without doing mi&s;chief. And had this matter been always wholly left to the judgment of parents, this is, probably all that would have been done, but the bu&s;ine&s;s of dre&s;&s;ing an infant is be|come a &s;ecret, which none but adepts mu&s;t pretend to under&s;tand. The child it&s;elf, however, di&s;covers to us the propriety of &s;uch clothing, by the happine&s;s and delight it expre&s;&s;es every time it is undre&s;&s;ed, and rubbed with a &s;oft hand. Whereas <HI>the art of dre&s;&s;ing</HI> has laid the foundation of many a bad &s;hape, and what is wor&s;e, of very bad health, through the greate&s;t part of life.&mdash;It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary in this day, to add any thing in this place in commendation of clean|line&s;s, unle&s;s it be to counteract a vulgar
<PB N="354" REF="026291_0368_0FCF89729ED5FF48">
notion, familiar only to common people, that a frequent change of linen has a tenden|cy to weaken new-born children; an ab|&s;urd idea, that has not the &s;malle&s;t founda|tion in rea&s;on or fact.</P>
<P>The tender infant being dre&s;&s;ed, and ha|ving undergone &s;uch other little di&s;cipline as has been mentioned, is u&s;ually &s;o far fati|gued by it, as &s;oon afterwards to fall into a &s;ound &s;leep. We &s;hall therefore leave it a while to be refre&s;hed, whil&s;t I endeavor to conduct the fond mother through the vari|ous other duties it calls for from day to day, till it happily arrives at an age free from the peculiar dangers of infancy.</P>
<P>In the pur&s;uit of &s;uch a plan, we meet with a variety of mi&s;cellaneous articles, and though many of them are not of apparent magnitude in them&s;elves, are in their con|&s;equences highly worthy of notice; which that they may be thrown into &s;ome kind of order, may all be very well cla&s;&s;ed under the &s;everal heads of the <HI>Non-naturals,</HI> as they are called. Such are air, meat, and drink; &s;leep and watching; motion and re&s;t; retention and &s;ecretion, and the pa&s;&s;i|ons of the mind; a due attention to which, may prevent many of the evils incident to this tender age.&mdash;The fir&s;t of the&s;e was &s;aid to be Air.</P>
<P>The great importance of this has been &s;et forth when &s;peaking of the di&s;ea&s;es of in|fants;
<PB N="355" REF="026291_0369_0FCFA62FE0EF4A28">
I &s;hall here in a more particular way ob&s;erve, that the age, con&s;titution, and other circum&s;tances of the child, and the &s;ea&s;on of the year, ought always to be ta|ken into con&s;ideration, <HI>that</HI> being highly proper on one occa&s;ion, which would be very detrimental at another. In general it may be &s;aid, that warmth is friendly to very young infants, but they &s;hould, neverthele&s;s, be inured gradually to endure the cold air, which is ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to their health. I cannot therefore agree with Dr. Arm|&s;trong, who thinks the rich lo&s;e fewer chil|dren than the poor, becau&s;e they are kept warmer. On the other hand, it was well &s;aid by one, that "a warm nur&s;ery fills a cold church-yard." Much caution, indeed, is nece&s;&s;ary on this head, in this un&s;ettled climate, and evinces the nece&s;&s;ity of parents &s;uperintending tho&s;e to who&s;e care they in-tru&s;t infant-children, &s;ince nur&s;es are often indi&s;creet in keeping them too long in the air at a time, which is a frequent occa&s;ion of their taking cold, and deters many parents from &s;ending them abroad &s;o often as they &s;hould. Another, and a wor&s;e, as well as common fault, of nur&s;es and &s;ervants, is, that of &s;tanding &s;till with children in their arms in a current of air, or even &s;itting down with other &s;ervants, and &s;uffering chil|dren who can run about, to play at a little di&s;tance by them&s;elves, &s;it down on the
<PB N="356" REF="026291_0370_0FCFA629CF56D588">
gra&s;s, and &s;uch like; the con&s;equences of which are often a long confinement to a warm room, and either a prohibition again&s;t going out &s;o much as they ought, or a fre&s;h cold owing to &s;ome of the like irregulari|ties. And I may here ob&s;erve, the lighte&s;t &s;ymptom of cold (which is al&s;o often taken in the lying-in room during the month,) is that called the <HI>&s;nuffles,</HI> or &s;toppage of the no&s;e, and in general requires nothing more than a little pomatum, or <HI>pomade divine,</HI> to be put to the no&s;trils when the child is laid in the cradle; or if this fail, a little white vitriol may be di&s;&s;olved in ro&s;e-water, and the bridge of the no&s;e often wetted with it.</P>
<P>It will be advi&s;eable, in order to inure in|fants to the air, that they be &s;hort-coated as early as the &s;ea&s;on of the year will permit; their dre&s;s &s;hould be &s;till loo&s;e and ea&s;y, and they may continue without &s;tockings even for two or three years, and boys till they are breeched. As to this change, I think, it had always better be made in the begin|ning of the winter, than in &s;ummer, as the dre&s;s upon the whole is warmer, e&s;pecially about the che&s;t, which from having been open for three or four years, it &s;eems rather &s;trange to cover, all at once, at the begin|ning of hot weather.</P>
<P>But though I have &s;aid children would be as well without &s;tockings, for a con&s;ider|ble time, I mu&s;t remark, that circum&s;tances
<PB N="357" REF="026291_0371_0FCFA628E082AD78">
are always to be taken into con&s;ideration. <HI>Mutatis mutandis</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Conduct &s;hould be directed by Circum&s;tances.</HI></NOTE> &s;hould not only be the motto of phy&s;icians, but of common life, and we &s;hould be guided by it in regard to all general rules. For want of this caution in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, tender children &s;uffer exceedingly in &s;evere winters, and are di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed with chilblains merely for want of proper covering to their tender limbs. I have &s;een a child of four or five years old, the daughter of people of fa&s;hion, (who I know will pardon my mentioning it) who&s;e legs were covered with chilblains quite up to the knee, and yet the lady could not be prevailed upon in time, to &s;uffer &s;tockings to be put on, becau&s;e &s;trong and healthy chil|dren are thought to be better without them.</P>
<P>The &s;econd article under the head of <HI>Non-naturals</HI> refer to meat and drink, and is worthy of ample di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, having as yet been con&s;idered only in relation to the expe|diency of <HI>brea&s;t-milk,</HI> where that may any|wi&s;e be procured.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place it may be remarked, that although an infant be &s;uckled by its own mother, it can certainly have no real need of any other food, till the time nature will bring milk into her brea&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing the child be laid to it in proper time; which,
<PB N="358" REF="026291_0372_0FCFA626726AF3B0">
doubtle&s;s, ought to be as &s;oon as &s;he may, by &s;leep or otherwi&s;e, be &s;ufficiently refre&s;h|ed to undergo the little fatigue that an at|tempt to &s;uckle may occa&s;ion. This method, however unu&s;ual with &s;ome, is the mo&s;t agree|able to nature, and to ob&s;ervations on the irrational &s;pecies, who in many things are the very be&s;t guides we can follow.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;ubject is largely and elegantly treated by Dr. Gregory, in his <HI>Comparative View,</HI> before quo|ted.</NOTE> By means of putting the child early to the brea&s;t, e&s;pecially the fir&s;t time of &s;uck|ling, the nipple will be formed, and the milk be gradually brought on. Hence much pain, and its con&s;equences will be prevented, as well as the frequency of &s;ore nipples, which in the fir&s;t lying-in, have been wont to occa&s;ion no incon&s;iderable trouble. But &s;hould this, or even an ab&s;ce&s;s take place, they are far le&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;ing under pro|per management than has been u&s;ually ima|gined<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See a Treati&s;e upon ulcers beforementioned; in which the <HI>milk-ab&s;ce&s;s,</HI> and <HI>&s;ore nipples</HI> are fully con&s;idered, and a &s;ucce&s;sful, and ea&s;y method of treatment pointed out.</NOTE>. However, &s;hould the mother be unable to &s;uckle, and a wet-nur&s;e be engag|ed, there can be no harm in putting the child to the brea&s;t, after it has taken a do&s;e or two of the opening medicine; or &s;hould

<P>And on this article, a va&s;t croud of ab|&s;urdities open upon us at once; and many of them with the &s;anction of cu&s;tom and au|thority. I &s;hall fir&s;t advert to thickne&s;s of the food: and it has, indeed, been matter of wonder, how the cu&s;tom of &s;tuffing new|born infants with bread could become &s;o univer&s;al, or the idea fir&s;t enter the mind of a parent, that &s;uch heavy food could be fit for its nouri&s;hment. It were well if the fond mother, and all well inclined nur&s;es had more ju&s;t ideas of the manner in which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> nouri&s;hed; and e&s;pecially, that it is not from the great quantity, nor from the quality of the food, &s;imply con&s;idered. They may &s;urely be led to conceive, that our nou|ri&s;hment ari&s;es from the u&s;e the &s;tomach makes of the food the body receives, which is to pa&s;s through &s;uch a change, called di|ge&s;tion, as renders it bal&s;amic, and fit to renew the ma&s;s of blood, which is daily wa&s;ting and con&s;umed. An improper kind, or too great a quantity taken at a time, or too ha&s;tily, before the &s;tomach has duly di&s;|po&s;ed of its former contents, prevents this
<PB N="360" REF="026291_0374_0FCFA620CC606948">
work of dige&s;tion, and by making bad juices, weakens in&s;tead of &s;trengthens the habit; and in the end produces Worms, Convul&s;ions, Rickets, King's evil, &s;low Fevers, and <HI>Mara&s;mus,</HI> or general Con|&s;umption.</P>
<P>Nature, it &s;hould be con&s;idered, has pro|vided only milk, for every animal adapted to draw it from the brea&s;t, and that of wo|men is certainly the thinne&s;t of them all; but at the &s;ame time, far more nutritive than bread. It is true, bread, as it requires more dige&s;tion, will lie longer on the &s;to|mach both of infants and adults, and hence, probably, becau&s;e it &s;atisfies the pre&s;ent cra|vings, it has been conceived to afford a greater proportion of nouri&s;hment; though mixed up only with water, as it too fre|quently is, it is far le&s;s nutritive than milk. Children ought to be frequently hungry, and as often &s;upplied with light food, of which milk is really the mo&s;t nutritive that we are acquainted with. This could never be doubted of, but from its pa&s;&s;ing &s;o quick|ly out of the &s;tomach; on which account, indeed, though not the propere&s;t food for adults, employed at hard labour, and many hours from home, it is the fitte&s;t of all for the more &s;edentary life of a tender infant, who cannot get that nouri&s;hment from bread or other &s;olid food, of which the &s;tomachs
<PB N="361" REF="026291_0375_0FCFA61F5D8042E8">
of adults are capable. It mu&s;t have been for want of attending to this con&s;ideration, that Dr. Arm&s;trong has &s;aid &s;o much in fa|vour of bread and other thick victuals; which, by the bye, he began to make u&s;e of for his own children (from its &s;ucce&s;s in whom he has ventured to recommend it,) only at the age of &s;ix or &s;even months; a mat|ter very different from &s;tuffing an infant with it almo&s;t as &s;oon as it is born. For every thing the &s;tomach cannot dige&s;t, it has been &s;aid, may be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as a poi&s;on, which if not puked up, or very &s;oon voided by &s;tool, may occa&s;ion &s;ickne&s;s, gripes, what are called inward fits, and all the train of bowel complaints, which may terminate in one or other of the evils ju&s;t mentioned.</P>
<P>Milk it&s;elf is produced from food taken in by the mother, and is the riche&s;t part of it. It is in her &s;tomach that the aliment is di&s;&s;olved, or dige&s;ted, which by a combina|tion of powers in the <HI>chylopoetic vi&s;cera,</HI> or parts preparing the chyle, is &s;o far animalized as to be converted into a kind of white blood; from whence it has been ob|&s;erved, every animal body is daily recruited. Hence it is very apparent, that previous to an infant having acquired &s;trength enough to convert &s;olid food into this whole&s;ome chyle, or white blood, the parent, by this wi&s;e &s;ub&s;titution in nature, has previou&s;ly ac|compli&s;hed

Whether that be prepared by its own mother, a nur&s;e, or even by animals, as the cow, or the a&s;s, is equally to the purpo&s;e; where the former cannot be had, the be&s;t, and mo&s;t natural &s;ub&s;titute, &s;hould be provided.</NOTE></P>
<P>It can &s;carcely be improper before I quit the article of &s;uckling, to relate a recent in|&s;tance, and a remarkable one out of many, as a proof of the great degree to which in|fants may pine for the brea&s;t, even to the great hazard of peri&s;hing for the want of it, where the real cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e is not &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>This infant was very healthy when it was three months old, and was then weaned on account of the illne&s;s of the wet nur&s;e; but &s;oon afterwards cea&s;ed to thrive, and had continual bowel complaints. At the age of nine months I was de&s;ired to vi&s;it it, and was informed that it &s;lept very little, was almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly crying, and had for many days brought up almo&s;t all its food; was become very rickety, and had all the ap|pearance of an infant almo&s;t &s;tarved. It had made trial of almo&s;t every kind of food, except the brea&s;t, and had been many weeks
<PB N="363" REF="026291_0377_0FCFA61BB41EC218">
under the care of an experienced apothe|cary; was con&s;tantly in a &s;tate of purging, and &s;eemed to have been ju&s;t kept alive by art.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t &s;ight of the child, and upon the very face of this account, it was very evident, that the infant was not nouri&s;hed by the food it received, and that the com|plaint lay wholly in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages. But reduced as it was, I had little expectation from medicines, and therefore gave as my opinion that either the child &s;till pined for the brea&s;t, in which ca&s;e, I doubted not, it would take it, though it had now been weaned &s;ix months; or that it ought to be carried immediately into the country, and be &s;upported for &s;ome time only upon a&s;&s;es milk, or perhaps be fed, now and then, with a little good broth.</P>
<P>My advice being taken, a good brea&s;t was procured, which the infant &s;eized the moment it was put to it, and after &s;ucking &s;ufficiently, &s;oon fell a&s;leep for &s;everal hours; waked without &s;creaming, and took the brea&s;t again. It is &s;ufficient to add, that the child cea&s;ed to puke or be purged, and recovered from that hour; and after &s;uck|ing eight or nine months longer, became in the end a fine healthy child.</P>
<P>To return; I am free then to lay it down as an axiom, that milk ought to be the chief part of the diet of Infants for a certain time,

whether it be brea&s;t-milk or any other; I might perhaps &s;ay ninety-nine out of a hun|dred. Exceptions, I believe, there may be, but much fewer children would peri&s;h if no exception were to be made, than by ab&s;urdly ru&s;hing into the contrary extreme. But &s;uppo&s;ing a very &s;trong child, at the end of the month, really not &s;atisfied with milk only, and always craving the moment it has been thus fed, it, doubtle&s;s, may have a little boiled bread added to it, two or three times in the day; but I &s;hould be very cautious how I extended it farther.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"In Italy, Holland, Turkey, and through the whole Levant, children are rarely allowed any other food than the brea&s;t-milk, during the fir&s;t year."

Per|haps where bread and milk is allowed, whe|ther at a very early or a later period, it would be an advantage to boil a piece of roll, together with the upper cru&s;t, in a

<P>It would, I perceive, lead me beyond all bounds to enter farther into this matter; and I &s;hould not, indeed, have &s;aid &s;o much on the &s;ubject, had I not had it much at heart to per&s;uade tho&s;e who&s;e affections would ever lead them right, were their judgments not previou&s;ly perverted.&mdash;I &s;hall only add, that infants certainly ought not to be fed lying on their backs, but &s;itting upright; as they will in this po&s;ition &s;wal|low their food more ea&s;ily, as well as more readily di&s;cover when they &s;hall have had enough.</P>

their food; though the hope of quieting them, it has been ob&s;erved, is frequently the nur&s;e's &s;ole motive for giving it.

<P>The pot is formed in the &s;hape of an Ar|gyle, or gravy-pot, with a long &s;pout, ri|&s;ing from the bottom, and pierced only with a few &s;mall holes at the end, which is to be covered with a piece of vellum, or parch|ment; which being left loo&s;e a little way over the &s;pout, is &s;oft and plea&s;ant to the infant's mouth, and it has been &s;aid, is nearly as acceptable to many children as the brea&s;t, as I have often been a witne&s;s.</P>

<P>It is a common direction in works of this kind, to point out the propere&s;t times for feeding an infant brought up by hand, and to direct how often it may &s;afely be fed.

For infants not u&s;ually taking too much at a time in this manner of feeding, on account of the little fatigue which, it was ob&s;erved, they under|go in acquiring their nouri&s;hment, may ge|nerally be permitted to partake of it as often as they might of the brea&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Optimum vero medicamentum e&s;t, opportune cibus datus.

Before I clo&s;e this head of the manage|ment of children, perhaps the mo&s;t import|ant of all, I &s;hall point out the mo&s;t &s;uitable diet under the different complaints to which they are mo&s;t liable. And after the hints that have been thrown out through the for|mer part of this work, I need only ob&s;erve, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who are unacquainted with di&s;ea&s;es, that as light a diet as is po&s;&s;ible is u&s;ually called for when a child is unwell, let the di&s;order be almo&s;t whatever it may. If a fever &s;hould accompany it, the child will require &s;till le&s;s food than in any other com|plaint, but plenty of drinks; which may al&s;o be &s;o calculated as to furni&s;h nearly as much nouri&s;hment as the infant will require, and may in &s;ummer-time be given cold. Such are barley-water, water in which a cru&s;t of bread has been boiled, or if a purg|ing attends, rice-water, and a drink made of hart&s;horn &s;havings, with a little baked flour in it. In this complaint, wherein more nouri&s;hment is required to &s;upport the child under it, baked flour mixed up with boiled milk, (as mentioned under the article of purging) is admirably calculated both as a proper diet and medicine; and if kept in a dry place, may be pre&s;erved fit for u&s;e for a
<PB N="378" REF="026291_0392_0FCFA6009840CD20">
con&s;iderable time. For the like complaint, the food directed by Dr. Smith is very well adapted, and will afford a little variety. He orders a table-&s;poonful of ground rice to be boiled with a little cinnamon, in half a pint of water, till the water is nearly con&s;umed; a pint of milk is then to be added to it, and the whole to &s;ummer for five minutes: it is afterwards to be &s;trained through a lawn &s;ieve, and made palatable with a little &s;ugar. In this way, or joined with baked flour, as mentioned above, milk may gene|rally be made to agree perfectly well even when the bowels are purged; and when it does &s;o, proves exceedingly nouri&s;hing. Should it chance to di&s;agree, owing to an acidity in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, good beef-broth ought to be made trial of, which may be thickened with baked flour, in&s;tead of bread, and makes a very plea&s;ant, as well as anti|ace&s;cent diet.</P>
<P>Perhaps much more has been &s;aid on the &s;ubject of acidity, by &s;ome writers, then real|ly ought to have been, or it may at lea&s;t be &s;u&s;pected, that a proper attention has not been paid to the peculiar circum&s;tances of infants, who are all much di&s;po&s;ed to it. Acidity is probably rather an effect, than the fir&s;t cau&s;e of the di&s;orders of infants; though there is no doubt, that their com|plaints are afterwards aggravated by an abounding acid; or rather, probably, from
<PB N="379" REF="026291_0393_0FCFA5FF15CB3940">
this natural acid becoming morbidly acrid, through its being accidentally confined in the fir&s;t-pa&s;&s;ages.

<P>Children, however, become le&s;s &s;ubject to wind and hurtful acidities as they grow older, and the &s;tomach gets &s;tronger, as it is called. But &s;hould the&s;e complaints, not|with&s;tanding, continue ob&s;tinate, a little fine powder of camomile flowers, mixed in wa|ter, and warmed with a little ginger, will prove exceedingly bracing to the &s;tomach and bowels, and render them le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to acidity. Exerci&s;e al&s;o, according to the age and &s;trength, is a grand pre&s;ervative and remedy, and e&s;pecially making infants break wind after &s;ucking or feeding.

<P>I &s;hall only add farther, that when milk is frequently thrown up curdled, a little pre|pared oy&s;ter-&s;hell powder may be added to it, or a very &s;mall quantity of almond-&s;oap, or of common &s;alt,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a very great mi&s;take, though a common one, to imagine that &s;alt will di&s;po&s;e to the &s;curvy.

<P>Previous to the ob&s;ervations I have to of|fer on the head of weaning infants, it may not be ami&s;s to drop a few words on the proper diet for wet-nur&s;es. And here, an invariable attention &s;hould be paid to natural con&s;titu|tion and habit. Due allowance being made for the&s;e, it may be &s;aid, that milk, broth, and white &s;oups, plain puddings, fle&s;h meats of ea&s;y dige&s;tion, and a due mixture of ve|getables, with plenty of diluting drinks, and &s;uch proportion of more generous liquors, (&s;pirits excepted) as the variety of circum|&s;tances &s;hall direct, will be a proper diet for &s;uckling women. Re&s;pecting vegetables par|ticularly, the &s;tricte&s;t regard &s;hould be had to con&s;titution and habit. Wherever vege|tables, or even acids, uniformly agree with the &s;uckling parent or nur&s;e, I believe a healthy child will never &s;uffer by their par|taking of them, but on the contrary, the milk being thereby rendered thin and cool|ing, will prove more nouri&s;hing and &s;alutary, in con&s;equence of being ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion.</P>

attending it. The child ought to be in good health, e&s;pecially in regard to its bow|els, and doubtle&s;s, ought fir&s;t to have cut, at lea&s;t four of its teeth. This &s;eldom takes place till it is about a twelve-month old; and it may be ob&s;erved, that healthy women who &s;uckle their own children, and take proper exerci&s;e, do not u&s;ually become preg|nant again in le&s;s time.

<P>Any preparation for weaning is general|ly needle&s;s, and e&s;pecially that of feeding children before-hand, though made a com|mon excu&s;e for &s;tuffing them whil&s;t at the brea&s;t, with indige&s;tible food.

I, therefore, never have any fear in that re&s;pect, and &s;hould be hap|py
<PB N="384" REF="026291_0398_0FCFA6D800C2A808">
if any thing I can &s;ay from experience, may be the means of le&s;&s;ening the trouble of parents on this occa&s;ion, as well as coun|teracting, if po&s;&s;ible, a &s;entiment encouraged by &s;everal writers, which has, I believe, no real foundation in fact, but has too often been productive both of much inconveni|ence and mi&s;chief. But I do not by this in|tend to &s;ay, that a child of eight or ten months old would be injured, or often-times not benefited, by a little food once a day of a more &s;olid nature than the brea&s;t-milk, as indeed I have intimated before; but when children happen to be weaned much earlier, and are fed almo&s;t from the birth merely with that view, (which is often the ca&s;e) they may be e&s;&s;entially injured by it.</P>
<P>When the weaning is once entered upon, a great part of their food ought &s;till to be of milk, with puddings, broths, and but little meat; and they &s;hould never be fed, or even &s;uffered to drink in the night, from the fir&s;t; &s;uppo&s;ing them to be weaned at a proper age. The mere giving them drink, even only a few nights, creates the pain and trouble of two weanings in&s;tead of one, and if it be continued much longer, it not only breaks the re&s;t, but the child will acquire a habit of being fond of drinking; the con|&s;equence of which very often is a large belly, weak bowels, general debility, lax joints, and all the &s;ymptoms of rickets.

<HEAD>SLEEP and WATCHING.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER what has been already advanc|ed on this article, under the head of their complaints, it will be nece&s;&s;ary only to ob&s;erve, that healthy children &s;leep a great deal for the fir&s;t three or four days after they are born, probably from having been pre|viou&s;ly accu&s;tomed to it. They ought not, however, to be &s;uffered to continue this ha|bit in the day time, but &s;hould be gradually broken of it, and indeed if not indulged, they will not be &s;o much di&s;po&s;ed to &s;leep as is generally imagined, and will therefore take more re&s;t in the night, which is mutually beneficial to the child and the mother; who, e&s;pecially if &s;he &s;uckles, will be the le&s;s di&s;|turbed, at a time when &s;he her&s;elf particu|larly requires this refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>Therefore, when infants are &s;leeple&s;s in the night, they &s;hould be kept more awake,
<PB N="386" REF="026291_0400_0FCF89A5586F95B0">
and have as much exerci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible in the day time, which though they be ever &s;o young may be pretty con&s;iderable, (as will be directed more at large in its place,) by playing with them, or dandling on the knee, and otherwi&s;e amu&s;ing them; and when older by every kind of exerci&s;e they can bear. The child, if healthy, will &s;oon con|tract a habit of being very much awake while it is light, through that lively and re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit peculiar to infancy, and by this means, another evil will be much avoided, that of often laying a child down to &s;leep in the day time, for hours together, loaded with a thick dre&s;s, and covered be&s;ides with heavy clothes in a &s;oft bed, or the cradle.</P>
<P>But though I am confident the&s;e cautions will have their u&s;e, I am equally &s;atisfied that many children have much le&s;s &s;leep than they require, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion pre|&s;ently to notice; but then this deficiency is chiefly in the night, and is often the con&s;e|quence of &s;ome complaints which the child labours under. Upon the&s;e, however, &s;uf|ficient has already been &s;aid in the former part of this work, to which therefore the reader is referred.</P>
<P>Before I quit this article, it may be re|marked, that the cu&s;tom of con&s;tantly plac|ing infants on their backs, whether in the cradle or bed, is very improper: for by
<PB N="387" REF="026291_0401_0FCFA6D4D318A430">
this means, the &s;uperfluous humour &s;ecret|ed in the mouth, which, in the time of teeth|ing e&s;pecially, is very con&s;iderable, cannot be freely di&s;charged, and mu&s;t fall down into the &s;tomach, where its abundance occa&s;ions various di&s;orders. Infants &s;hould there|fore be frequently laid on their &s;ides, par|ticularly the right, as favourable to the &s;to|mach getting ea&s;ily rid of its contents; to which &s;ide al&s;o children, when &s;trong enough, will in&s;tinctively turn, if not pre|vented by the weight or confinement of their own clothes, or tho&s;e of the cradle or bed. The chief apology, for all which, is a fear of the infant's falling, or turning on its face; but this is rather an apology for the neglect of that nece&s;&s;ary attention to chil|dren, which whenever, it can be command|ed &s;hould never be &s;pared them.</P>
<P>It only remains, under this article, to &s;ay &s;omething of the Cradle, which mo&s;t wri|ters have &s;poken again&s;t. I believe, there is no doubt but the cu&s;tom of laying chil|dren down awake, and rocking them in a cradle in the day time, or at &s;even or eight o'clock in the evening, when they are to go into their night's &s;leep, as it is called, may be an occa&s;ion of making them more wakeful in the night, or at lea&s;t may may cau&s;e them to expect that kind of motion whenever they awake. But yet I cannot help thinking, there is &s;omething &s;o
<PB N="388" REF="026291_0402_0FCFA6D36CFE95D0">
truly natural, as well as plea&s;ant, in the wavy motion of a cradle, (when made u&s;e of at proper times) and &s;o like that children have been u&s;ed to before they are born, being then &s;u&s;pended and accu&s;tomed to ride, as it were, or be gently &s;wung in a &s;oft fluid, upon every motion of the mother, and even during her &s;leep, from the effects of re&s;piration; that always wi&s;hing to fol|low nature as I do, I cannot, on the whole, but give an opinion rather in favour of the cradle.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">the objections made by &s;ome late writers to this &s;entiment militate only again&s;t the abu&s;e of it, from any violent rocking; as though infants mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be jumbled in a cradle like travellers in a mail|coach.</NOTE> It is, at lea&s;t, among the little things in which we may harmle&s;sly err, and in which every mother may therefore be &s;afely guided by her own opinion, or even by her feelings. And if the child in con|&s;equence of being &s;ometimes rocked to &s;leep in the day time, &s;hall expect it when it awakes in the night, it will not be very difficult to find a &s;ub&s;titute for it; and indeed parents &s;eem, as it were by in&s;tinct, to pat and gent|ly move a child, whether lying on the lap or the arm, whenever it appears to awake prematurely.&mdash;I &s;hall only add on this head, what cannot be too often urged, that how|ever wakeful a child may be in the night, it cannot receive a greater unkindne&s;s than from the exhibition of Godfrey's cordial,

<HEAD>MOTION and REST.</HEAD>
<P>IT is only the former of the&s;e that will claim much of our attention, as infants ought &s;carcely ever to be in a quie&s;cent po&s;|ture, but when they are a&s;leep; and happy for them, that active principle with which nature hath endowed them, is &s;o vigorous and overflowing, that they will hardly &s;ub|mit to it. Exerci&s;e, like air, is indeed of &s;o much importance to children, that they can|not po&s;&s;ibly be truly healthy without it; care only &s;hould be taken that it be pro|perly &s;uited to their age.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t kind of exerci&s;e, it has been &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ts in dandling, as it is called, patting the back after feeding, and gently
<PB N="390" REF="026291_0404_0FCF89A106892C08">
rai&s;ing the child up and down in the arms; taking care at fir&s;t not to to&s;s it very high, infants being very early &s;u&s;ceptible of fear, and even capable of being thrown into fits by it. Another exerci&s;e adapted to this tender age, and of the utmo&s;t advantage, is rubbing them with the hand. This &s;hould be done <HI>all over,</HI> at lea&s;t twice a day, when they are dre&s;&s;ed and undre&s;&s;ed, and ought to be continued for &s;ome time, being pecu|liarly agreeable to the child, as it con&s;tant|ly te&s;tifies by &s;tretching out its little limbs, and pu&s;hing them again&s;t the hand, with a &s;mile expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;atisfaction it receives from it. Such gentle exerci&s;e may be par|tially repeated every time the child's cloths are changed, by rubbing the lower limbs, and every other part within reach.</P>
<P>When children are older, their exerci&s;e &s;hould be proportionally increa&s;ed, and as has been ob&s;erved, they ought never to be car|ried in a quie&s;cent po&s;ture, but the arm that &s;upports them &s;hould be continually in &s;uch motion as the nur&s;e is able to continue. For children, it has been noticed, delight to be in con&s;tant motion; and this exuberant ac|tivity is given them for the wi&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es, and ought by no means to be connteracted. And I notice the mode of carrying them, becau&s;e I have &s;een children flung carele&s;sly over the arm in &s;uch a manner, as neither affords a child any exerci&s;e, nor allows it to give any motion to it&s;elf; which a lively
<PB N="391" REF="026291_0405_0FCFA6D1F0517608">
child will always endeavour to do. And, indeed, the manner of carrying an infant, is of more importance than is generally ima|gined, for from it, the child will contract a habit, good or bad, that it will not readily give up, and may be as much di&s;po&s;ed to be|come rickety by improper management in the arms, as if it were lying wet in the cra|dle; the ill effects of which have been point|ed out already.</P>
<P>Much as there has been &s;aid on this ar|ticle, I cannot &s;uffer it to be clo&s;ed without dropping a hint or two with a peculiar re|ference to <HI>females;</HI> upon whom be&s;ide every infirmity common to the other &s;ex, is im|po&s;ed the painful ta&s;k of child-bearing. It is the benefit of the lower cla&s;s of people, indeed, that I have here principally in view; though the caution is not utterly unnece&s;&s;ary el&s;ewhere.&mdash;The many di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and &s;ometimes fatal labours I have been witne&s;s to, have led me to regard with a kind of horror a rickety, di&s;torted female infant, who&s;e parents or nur&s;e's neglect, or igno|rance, is heaping up for it additional &s;uffer|ings and dangers, to tho&s;e which are great enough under every advantage that art, and good health contribute.</P>

low &s;eat, whereby that a&s;&s;emblage of bones, called the <HI>pelvis,</HI> or ba&s;in, is pre&s;&s;ed be|tween the lower extremities and the infe|rior part of the back bone, and is made to grow out of its natural form. The con&s;e|quences of this change of figure, if it be any wi&s;e con&s;iderable, cannot fail to be produc|tive of increa&s;ed pain and dangers in par|turition, frequently equally fatal both to the parent and her offspring.</P>
<P>I am aware, that many poor people are not in a &s;ituation to give their children all the exerci&s;e they require; they may, how|ever, &s;uffer them to afford as much as po&s;&s;i|ble to them&s;elves, by allowing them to <HI>crawl</HI> about on the floor, near an open window or door, in&s;tead of compelling them to lie on their back, or to &s;it upright, pinned in a chair; the ill-con&s;equences of which are &s;o exceedingly evident.</P>
<P>It is hoped no apology may be thought nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e obvious remarks, &s;ince no pains &s;hould be thought too great if they may prevent the evils here pointed out, nor can too much be &s;aid to inculcate good nur&s;ing (and e&s;pecially exerci&s;e) which is alone adequate thereto.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A proper attention to the&s;e articles has been con|ceived to be of &s;o much importance, that the bene|volent Governors of the Briti&s;h Lying-in ho&s;pital, have lately given orders, that &s;ome brief Directions on the&s;e heads &s;hould be drawn up, and given to every mother, on her leaving that Charity.</NOTE></P>

It may be a proper inquiry in this place, at what age children &s;hould be put on their feet, a point on which people have differed con&s;iderably; but I apprehend nothing more is required than to follow nature, who&s;e progre&s;s is always gradual, as our imita|tions of her &s;hould be, and we &s;hall then &s;eldom run very wide of her intention. If we take notice of a healthy child, it is, as has been &s;aid, always in motion, and as &s;oon as it gets &s;trength, it will &s;upport it&s;elf by the help of its hands and feet, and will crawl about wherever it is permitted. From this exerci&s;e, it will &s;oon acquire an increa&s;e of &s;trength, and whenever it is upheld by the arms, and di&s;entangled from the weight of its clothes at the time of dre&s;&s;ing and un|dre&s;&s;ing, it will naturally walk up the wai&s;t of its mother, or nur&s;e,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot help taking notice here of an impru|dence on this occa&s;ion, which it is well if it has not been prejudicial oftener than has been &s;u&s;pected; I mean, that of &s;uffering a child to crawl &s;o high up the neck, as renders the mother, or nur&s;e, incapable of rai&s;ing the arms high enough to &s;upport it.

Children in health never wi&s;h to &s;it &s;till when they do not actually feel it to be nece&s;&s;ary, much le&s;s to go to bed un&s;ea&s;on|ably &s;oon. But it is to remembered, that young people require more &s;leep, and to be longer in a horizontal po&s;ture than adults; for though they u&s;ually ri&s;e very early, they
<PB N="398" REF="026291_0412_0FCFA6C5518CDBE0">
get to re&s;t more than proprtionally &s;oon, being di&s;po&s;ed to fall a&s;leep almo&s;t the mo|ment they are &s;till; and this is natural to them, and is one demon&s;tration of the ad|vantage of exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>If I had not already far exceeded the bounds I had intended, I &s;hould be induced to &s;ay &s;omething on the Manner in which Exerci&s;e becomes &s;o beneficial to children&mdash;I &s;hall, however, ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that it tends to pu&s;h forward the blood through the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, and to unfold them in the manner nature has de&s;igned them to be extended, in order to promote the growth of the infant, whil&s;t it pre&s;erves the blood in a proper &s;tate of fluidity, and promotes both the Secre|tions and excretions; which are the next things it was propo&s;ed to con&s;ider.</P>

<HEAD>RETENTION and EXCRETION.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY medical reader will be &s;en&s;ible, how greatly health depends upon a due proportion between the daily &s;upplies, and the various di&s;charges of the body: the latter will vary according to the diet, age, and particular mode of life of each in|dividual. The excretions of infants, how|ever, in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration excepted, are chiefly from the bowels and bladder; but the latter is not very liable to di&s;orders. It
<PB N="399" REF="026291_0413_0FCFA6C39BE4D6B0">
will be &s;ufficient therefore to &s;ay, that the retention of urine is chiefly &s;oon after birth, and is u&s;ually removed by applying a blad|der of hot water to the belly, and gentle rubbing with a little warm brandy, or an onion, and throwing up a cly&s;ter; or &s;hould the&s;e fail, the infant may be put up to the brea&s;t in a pan of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> water, and take a little mar&s;h-mallow, or par&s;ley-tea, &s;weet|ened with honey, with the addition of a few drops of the &s;pirit of nitrous aether. This, if there be no mal-formation of parts, will generally produce the de&s;ired effect in the cour&s;e of a few hours; though ca&s;es have occurred in which infants have voided no urine for the &s;pace of four days, and have &s;uffered very little inconvenience. Some of the old writers have &s;poken al&s;o of inconti|nence of urine, ari&s;ing from weakne&s;s of the &s;phincter of the bladder, but I have ne|ver met with it in the infant-&s;tate. They pre&s;cribe agrimony and myrrhe, and direct a&s;tringent fomentations of red wine to the belly, the <HI>perinaeum,</HI> or feat, and the loins.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent ob&s;ervations are therefore chiefly confined to the Bowels, which would call for a &s;crupulous attention in this place, if &s;o many things relative to them had not been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the former part of this treati&s;e. It were needle&s;s, therefore, to &s;ay more, than to remind common readers, that infants are rarely healthy long toge|ther,

who have not two or three &s;tools eve|ry day; or &s;hould they be more, for the fir&s;t three months, if the child be brought up at the brea&s;t, and the nur&s;e have a &s;uffi|ciency of milk, it will generally thrive the better. The &s;tools likewi&s;e ought to be loo&s;e, of a yellow colour, free from lumps, or curdly matter, and &s;hould come away without griping. On the other hand, if an infant is brought up by hand, the danger generally lies in the other extreme, &s;uch children being di&s;po&s;ed to be purged, and to have griping and &s;our &s;tools, from the ace&s;cent, and often indige&s;tible nature of their food, e&s;pecially if fed by the &s;poon; and therefore require an early attention when their bowels are di&s;po&s;ed to be open, and their food to be changed, in the man|ner directed under the article of Purging.</P>

<HEAD>THE PASSIONS of the MIND.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the la&s;t Article mentioned as in|cluded in the <HI>Non-naturals,</HI> and on which I &s;hall be very brief, it being the happine&s;s of Infants to be very little affected by them. This article, can, therefore, relate to them merely in regard to their mode of expre&s;&s;ing &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions, and principally in re&s;pect to Laughter and Crying. The former, if too long kept up, or too violent, may not only
<PB N="401" REF="026291_0415_0FCFA6C0990D5480">
induce the hiccough, but it is &s;aid, may even throw an infant into fits. The latter is, indeed, much oftener &s;u&s;pected of being mi&s;chievous, and chiefly by occa&s;ioning fits, or a rupture: the exce&s;s of both the&s;e af|fections &s;hould, therefore, be guarded a|gain&s;t. Moderate, and not too frequent crying, however, ought not to be alarm|ing; and, indeed, a variety of con&s;idera|tions induce me to believe, that this expre&s;|&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;ions in Infants is not only much more harmle&s;s in it&s;elf than is gene|rally imagined, but is al&s;o, in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;alutary. The fir&s;t Cries it makes we know to be &s;o, and that children recover from the paroxy&s;ms of &s;ome complaints (as was men|tioned in regard to the Croup) by an effort of this kind. It is evident likewi&s;e, how very much Health depends on a free circu|lation of the blood through the lungs, and on their free expan&s;ion from the dilatation of the <HI>bronchial,</HI> or air-ve&s;&s;els, that run through them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fletus moderatus pueris non obe&s;t&mdash;pectus dila|tat et calefacit. Primeros.</NOTE> But as infants are incapable of giv|ing them&s;elves any exerci&s;e, and indeed of receiving that kind which tends to promote &s;uch an effect, I have conceived Crying to be an effort which Nature may have wi&s;ely
<PB N="402" REF="026291_0416_0FCF899A30611DD8">
&s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;upport of this &s;entiment, which I conceiv|ed not to be a very common one, I quoted, in the former edition, the above authority of <HI>Primero&s;e. Mr. Le Febure de Villebrune's</HI> tran&s;lation has &s;ince furni&s;hed me with a better and more ancient one.&mdash;Ari&s;tot. Politic. Lib. vii. C. 17, where the idea is &s;upported more at large.</NOTE> Whatever is truly natural I always conceive to be right, though every thing is capable of being abu&s;ed, and the mo&s;t beneficial dictates of nature may be exceeded. I am &s;atisfied, however, that the pacifying of children by improper means, and e&s;pecially cramming them with food when they are not hungry, (again&s;t which &s;o much has been &s;aid) occa&s;ions far greater evils in thou&s;ands of in&s;tances, than ever were produced by the efforts of Crying.&mdash;But the Nur&s;e who can with calmne&s;s, hear an Infant cry, without attempting to pacify it, by every proper means, is a Mon&s;ter in human &s;hape, unfit to be tru&s;ted with the care of any animal being, much le&s;s with a tender, helple&s;s creature, who&s;e only lan|guage, by which it can expre&s;s its wants or its &s;ufferings, is its Tears.</P>
<P>It cannot help tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the reader's time to make one apology more for having dwelt &s;o long on this, as well as on &s;everal other heads; my motive has been the de&s;ire of in&s;tructing, though in &s;ome in&s;tances at

<P>I &s;hall conclude by ob&s;erving, that, tho' the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Mind refer &s;o little to In|fants, they relate very materially to the Wet-nur&s;e; who be&s;ides endeavouring to keep her &s;pirits as calm as po&s;&s;ible, ought to be exceedingly careful not to put a child to her brea&s;t, when under the influence of any violent pa&s;&s;ion, of whatever kind it may be, the bad effects of which have already been in&s;tanced in the former part of this treati&s;e. And I &s;hall think my&s;elf well recompen&s;ed for the trouble I have had, if this, or other hints, may prove the means of le&s;&s;ening the dangers of the infant-&s;tate, and the con&s;equent &s;ad fatality that attends it; as well as of abating the anxiety of the fond Mother, who after having brought her tender Charge into the world with Sorrow, is pierced with double Pangs at its leaving it.&mdash;An Event which, as Experience war|rants me to &s;ay, may by Art and good Management, be often prevented, the au|thor
