<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN obedience to your de&s;ire, I have &s;ent you the hi&s;tory of the yellow fever as it appeared <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the year 1748, which, as far as I can remember, agreed in its &s;ymptoms with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, when it vi&s;ited this town in former years. In <HI>this</HI> hi&s;tory, I have confined my&s;elf to a faith|ful narration of facts, and have avoided any phy&s;ical inquiry into the cau&s;es of the &s;everal &s;ymptoms in this di&s;ea&s;e; as that would have required more lei&s;ure than I am, at pre&s;ent, ma&s;ter of, and would per|haps have been le&s;s u&s;eful than a plain de|&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="035733_0003_10063D0FBB342C78">
I wrote this hi&s;tory, &s;o far as it relates to the &s;ymptoms and progno&s;tics, in the year 1748, when we had the di&s;ea&s;e la&s;t in this place; intending afterwards, if it return|ed, to add, from further experience, the method of cure, and likewi&s;e an account of any other &s;ymptoms which might at|tend it; but as no &s;uch opportunity has offered, I mu&s;t now omit that part. How|ever, I hope the de&s;cription which I have given of this dreadful malady, which &s;o frequently rages like the plague in the &s;outhern parts of America, is &s;o full, that a phy&s;ician may, from thence, not only form a true judgment of its nature, but likewi&s;e be able to deduce and communi|cate &s;ome more certain method of cure, than has perhaps hitherto been u&s;ed.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry I could not give a fuller account of the di&s;&s;ections of tho&s;e who died of this di&s;ea&s;e, having unfortunately lo&s;t my notes taken from tho&s;e di&s;&s;ections.</P>
<P><HI>I am,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="035733_0004_10065DE6D2504B20">I. THAT <HI>fever,</HI> which continues two or three days, and terminates without any critical di&s;charge by &s;weat, urine, &s;tool, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> leaving the patient exce&s;&s;ively weak, with a &s;mall pul&s;e, ea&s;ily depre&s;&s;ible by very little motion, or by an erect po&s;ture; and <HI>which</HI> is &s;oon &s;ucceeded with an icteritious colour in the white of the eyes and the &s;kin, vomiting, haemorrhages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the&s;e, without being accompanied with any degree of a febrile pul&s;e and heat, is called in Ame|rica, the <HI>yellow fever.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. THIS fever does not &s;eem to take its origin from any particular con&s;titution of the weather, independent of <HI>infectious mia&s;mata,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Warren</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his Treati&s;e concerning the malignant fever in Barbados</NOTE> has formerly well ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>FOR within the&s;e twenty-five years, it has only been four times epidemical in this town, namely, in the autumns of the year 1732, 39, 45 and 48, though none of the&s;e years (ex|cepting that of 1739, who&s;e &s;ummer and autumn were remarkably rainy) were either
<PB N="6" REF="035733_0005_10065DE9CB359548">warmer or more rainy (and &s;ome of them le&s;s &s;o) than the &s;ummers and autumns were in &s;everal other years, in which we had not one in&s;tance of any one being &s;eized with this fever; which is contrary to what would probably have happened, if particular con&s;ti|tutions of the weather were productive of it, without infectious <HI>mia&s;mata.</HI> But that this is really an infectious di&s;ea&s;e, &s;eems plain, not only from this, that almo&s;t all the nur&s;es catched it and died of it; but likewi&s;e, as &s;oon as it appeared in town, it &s;oon invaded new|comers, tho&s;e who never had the di&s;ea&s;e be|fore, and country-people when they came to town, while tho&s;e who remained in the coun|try e&s;caped it, as likewi&s;e did tho&s;e who had formerly felt its <HI>dire</HI> effects, though they walk|ed about the town, vi&s;ited the &s;ick in all the different <HI>&s;tadia</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e, and attended the funeral of tho&s;e who died of it. And la&s;tly, whenever the di&s;ea&s;e appeared here, it was ea&s;ily traced to &s;ome per&s;on who had lately arrived from &s;ome of the We&s;t-Indian I&s;lands, where it was epidemical. Although the in|fection was &s;pread with great celerity through the town, yet if any from the country receiv|ed it in town, and &s;ickened on their return
<PB N="7" REF="035733_0006_10065DEB68D264C8">home, the infection &s;pread no further, not even &s;o much as to one in the &s;ame hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE &s;ubjects which were &s;u&s;ceptible of this fever, were both &s;exes of the white colour, e&s;pecially &s;trangers lately arrived from cold climates, Indians, Mi&s;tees, Mulat|toes of all ages, excepting young children and of tho&s;e only &s;uch as had formerly e&s;caped the infection. And indeed it is a great happi|ne&s;s that our con&s;titutions undergo &s;uch al|terations in the &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les and yel|low fever, as for ever afterwards &s;ecure us from a &s;econd attack of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. There is &s;omething very &s;ingular in the con&s;titution of the Negroes, which renders them no lia|ble to this fever; for though many of the&s;e were as much expo&s;ed as the nur&s;es to the infection, yet I never knew one in&s;tance of this fever among&s;t them, though they are equally &s;ubject with the white people to the <HI>bilious fever.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. THIS fever began in the middle or rather towards the end of Augu&s;t, and con|tinued till near the middle of October, when the weather became cold enough to prevent
<PB N="8" REF="035733_0007_10065DECF7C49C80">its further progre&s;s. In the beginning of Augu&s;t, the weather was warmer than I had ever known it in that month: the mercury in Farenheit's thermometer, for &s;ome days at 2 o'clock, <HI>p. m.</HI> ro&s;e, in the &s;haded air, to the 96th degree, at which time &s;everal people died of apoplexies. The latter part of Au|gu&s;t and the fir&s;t week in September were much more temperate; the weather being then much as u&s;ual at that &s;ea&s;on of the year. The &s;econd week in September was cold, the wind being con&s;tantly ea&s;terly and the wea|ther cloudy; after which time I kept a re|gi&s;ter of the heat of the &s;haded air; an ab|&s;tract of which follows.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>IN all the month of September, and in the greate&s;t part of October, the wind was ea&s;terly.</P>
<P>THE depth of the rain in Augu&s;t, Sep|tember and October re&s;pectively, was 6.881, 7.442 and 5.550 inches; which, though it exceeded the rain of the&s;e three months tak|en together at a medium, from the ten pre|ceding years, by 5.570 inches, yet it was inferior to that which fell in the &s;ame months in &s;everal other years; for in the years 1747, 50, 51 and 52, there fell re|&s;pectively, in tho&s;e three months of the&s;e years, above 21, 22, 24 and 26 inches of rain.</P>
<P N="5">V. FOR a day or two before the attack of the fever, people in general complained of a headach, pain in the loins and extremities, e&s;pecially in the knees and calves of the legs, lo&s;s of appetite, debility and a &s;pontaneous la&s;&s;itude.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="035733_0009_10065DF30065C6B0">SOME, however, were &s;eized &s;uddenly, without any &s;uch previous &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P N="6">VI. AFTER a chillne&s;s and horror, with which this di&s;ea&s;e generally invades, a fever &s;ucceeded, in which,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>pul&s;e</HI> was very frequent till near the termination of the fever, and was gene|rally full, hard, and con&s;equently &s;trong: in &s;ome, it was &s;mall and hard, in others, &s;oft and &s;mall; but in all tho&s;e ca&s;es, it frequently varied in its fulne&s;s and hardne&s;s. Towards the termination of the fever, the pul&s;e be|came &s;maller, harder, and le&s;s frequent. In &s;ome there was a remarkable throbbing in the carotids and in the <HI>hypochondria</HI>; in the latter of which it was &s;ometimes &s;o great, that it cau&s;ed a con&s;tant tremulous motion of the <HI>abdomen.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>heat,</HI> generally, did not exceed 102 degrees of Farenheit's thermometer; in &s;ome it was le&s;s, it varied frequently, and was commonly nearly equal in all parts, the heat about the <HI>praecordia</HI> being &s;eldom more inten&s;e than in the extremities, when the&s;e were kept covered. In the fir&s;t day of the
<PB N="11" REF="035733_0010_10065DF4B7300958">di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ome had frequent returns of a &s;en&s;e of chillne&s;s, though there was not any abate|ment of their heat. In a few, there hap|pened &s;o great a remi&s;&s;ion of the heat for &s;ome hours, when at the &s;ame time the pul&s;e was &s;oft and le&s;s frequent and the &s;kin moi&s;t, that one from the&s;e circum&s;tances might rea&s;onably have hoped that the fever would only prove a remittent or intermit|tent. About the end of the &s;econd day, the heat began to abate.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>&s;kin</HI> was &s;ometimes (though rare|ly) dry; but oftener, and indeed generally, it was moi&s;t and di&s;po&s;ed to &s;weat.</P>
<P>ON the fir&s;t day, the &s;weating was com|monly profu&s;e and general; on the &s;econd day, it was more moderate: but on both the&s;e, there happened frequent and &s;hort re|mi&s;&s;ions of the &s;weatings; at which times the febrile heat increa&s;ed, and the patient became more unea&s;y. On the third day, the di&s;po&s;ition to &s;weat was &s;o much abated, that the &s;kin was generally dry; only the forehead and backs of the hands continued moi&s;t.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="12" REF="035733_0011_10065DF653E7F668">4. THE <HI>re&s;piration</HI> was by no means fre|quent or difficult, but was &s;oon accelerated by motion, or the fatigue of drinking a cup of any liquid.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE <HI>tongue</HI> was moi&s;t, rough and white, even to its tip and edges. On the &s;econd day, its middle in &s;ome was brown. On the third day, the whitene&s;s and rough|ne&s;s of the tongue began to abate.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE <HI>thir&s;t</HI> in very few was great.</P>
<P N="7">7. A <HI>nau&s;ea, vomiting</HI> or frequent <HI>reach|ings</HI> to vomit, e&s;pecially after the exhibition of either medicines or food, came on gene|rally the third day, as the fever began to le&s;&s;en; or rather as the fullne&s;s of the pul&s;e, heat, and di&s;po&s;ition to &s;weat began to abate. Some indeed, but very few, on the fir&s;t day, had a vomiting either bilious or phlegmatic.</P>
<P N="8">8. VERY few complained of <HI>anxiety</HI> or oppre&s;&s;ion about the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">raecordia</HI> or <HI>hypochon|dria,</HI> nor was there any ten&s;ion or hardne&s;s about the latter.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="13" REF="035733_0012_10065DFAE96AC0B0">9. ON the fir&s;t day they generally <HI>dozed</HI> much, but afterwards were very <HI>watchful.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s</HI> and almo&s;t continual <HI>jacta|tions</HI> came on the &s;econd day.</P>
<P N="11">11. A great <HI>de&s;pondency</HI> attended the &s;ick from the fir&s;t attack.</P>
<P N="12">12. THE <HI>&s;trength</HI> was greatly <HI>pro&s;trated</HI> from the fir&s;t attack.</P>
<P N="13">13. THE <HI>pain</HI> in the <HI>head, loins, &amp;c.</HI> of which they had complained (V) before the attack, were greatly increa&s;ed, and in &s;ome, the pain in the forehead was very acute and darting; but tho&s;e pains went generally off the &s;econd day.</P>
<P N="14">14. THE <HI>face</HI> was flu&s;hed, and the eyes were hot, inflamed and unable to bear much light.</P>
<P N="15">15. ON the fir&s;t day, many of them, at times, were a little <HI>delirious,</HI> but afterwards not until the rece&s;s of the fever.</P>
<P N="16"><PB N="14" REF="035733_0013_10065DFC6FB3F1D0">16. THE <HI>blood</HI> &s;aved at venaefection had not any inflammatory cru&s;t; in warm weather, it was florid like arterial blood, and continued in one &s;oft homogeneous-like ma&s;s, without any &s;eparation of the <HI>&s;erum</HI> after it was cold. When there was any &s;eparation, the <HI>cra&s;&s;a|mentum</HI> was of too lax a texture.</P>
<P N="17">17. THE <HI>&s;tools,</HI> after the fir&s;t day, were fetid, inclined to a black colour, and were very rarely bilious, &s;oft or liquid, excepting when forced by art; for an ob&s;tinate co&s;tive|ne&s;s attended the febrile &s;tate.</P>
<P N="18">18. THE <HI>urine</HI> was di&s;charged in a large quantity, was pale, &s;ometimes limpid, and rarely of a higher than a &s;traw colour, except when the weather was very warm, and then it was more &s;aturated, of a deep colour, and di&s;charged in &s;maller quantities. It had a large cloud, except when it was very pale or limpid; but more generally it had a copious, white &s;ediment, even in the fir&s;t day of the fever.</P>
<P>ON the &s;econd day, the urine continued to be di&s;charged very copiou&s;ly; in &s;ome, it
<PB N="15" REF="035733_0014_10065DFE1C7C7330">was then turbid, and depo&s;ited a more copi|ous &s;ediment, than on the fir&s;t day; this &s;e|diment was &s;ometimes of a browni&s;h colour; in which ca&s;e it was generally followed by bloody urine, either about the end of the &s;e|cond or beginning of the third day. The co|lour and quantity of the urine, di&s;charged in equal times, were remarkably variable, being now limpid, then of a deeper colour, now di&s;charged in a larger, then in a &s;maller quan|tity, which could not be a&s;cribed to any change made either in the quantity or quali|lity of the drink, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. THE fever accompanied with tho&s;e (VI.) &s;ymptoms, terminated on the third day, or generally in le&s;s than 72 hours from the fir&s;t attack, not by any a&s;&s;imulation, or coction and excretion of the morbid matter; for if by the latter, there would have been &s;ome critical di&s;charge by &s;weat, urine, &s;tool, or otherwi&s;e, none of which happened; and if, by the former, nothing then would have remained but great debility. No; this fever did not terminate in either of the&s;e &s;alutary ways, excepting in &s;ome, who were happy enough to have the di&s;ea&s;e conquered in the
<PB N="16" REF="035733_0015_10065DFFA4CBBD20">beginning by proper evacuations, and by keeping up a plentiful &s;weat, till the total &s;o|lution of the fever, by proper mild diapho|retics and diluents. But tho&s;e who had not that good fortune, however tranquil things might appear at this period, (as great debi|lity and a little yellowne&s;s in the white of the eyes, &s;eemed then to be the chief com|plaints, excepting when the vomiting con|tinued), yet the face of affairs was &s;oon chan|ged; for this period was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by the &s;econd <HI>&s;tadium</HI>; a &s;tate, though without any fever, much more terrible than the fir&s;t: the &s;ymptoms in which were the following.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. 1. THE <HI>pul&s;e,</HI> immediately after the rece&s;s of the fever, was very little more fre|quent than in health, but hard and &s;mall. However, tho' it continued &s;mall, it became, &s;oon afterwards, &s;lower and very &s;oft; and this &s;oftne&s;s of the pul&s;e remained as long as the pul&s;e could be felt. In many, in this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, the pul&s;e gradually &s;ub&s;id|ed, until it became &s;carce perceptible; and this, notwith&s;tanding all the means u&s;ed to &s;upport and fill it; and when this was the ca&s;e, the icteritious-like &s;uffu&s;ion, the vo|miting,
<PB N="17" REF="035733_0016_10065E045B6922B8"><HI>delirium,</HI> re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> increa&s;ed to a great degree. In &s;ome, the pul&s;e, after being exceedingly &s;mall and &s;carce percepti|ble, recovered con&s;iderably its fullne&s;s; but that favourable appearance was generally of but &s;hort continuance.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>heat</HI> did not exceed the natural animal heat; and when the pul&s;e &s;ub&s;ided, the &s;kin became cold, and the face, brea&s;t and extremities acquired &s;omewhat of a livid co|lour.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>&s;kin</HI> was dry when the weather was cold, but was moi&s;t and clammy when the weather was hot.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE <HI>re&s;piration</HI> was natural or rather &s;low.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE <HI>tongue</HI> was moi&s;t and much clean|er than in the former (VI. 5.) &s;tage, its tip and edges, as al&s;o the gums and lips, were of a more florid red colour than u&s;ual.</P>
<P N="6">6. VERY few complained of <HI>thir&s;t,</HI> though they had a great de&s;ire for cold liquors.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="18" REF="035733_0017_10065E05E1712840">7. THE <HI>vomiting</HI> or <HI>reaching</HI> to vomit in|crea&s;ed, and in &s;ome was &s;o con&s;tant, that neither medicines nor aliment of any kind were retained. Some vomited blood; others only what was la&s;t exhibited, mixed with phlegm; and others again had what is called the <HI>black vomit.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That which is called the <HI>black vomit,</HI> at fir&s;t &s;ight, ap|pears to be black; but on a more careful examination, I ob&s;erved, that this colour proceeded from a great quantity of &s;mall, flakey, black &s;ub&s;tances which floated in the liquor thrown up by vomit; but the colour of this liquor was much the &s;ame with that which the patient had la&s;t drank, and was by no means black. Tho&s;e black flakey &s;ub&s;tances are the bile mixed with, or adhering to the <HI>mucus</HI> which lined the &s;tomach. For, upon di&s;&s;ection of tho&s;e who died of this di&s;ea&s;e, not only in this but former years, I always ob&s;erved that the <HI>mucus</HI> of the &s;tomach was abraded, and the bile in its <HI>cy&s;tis</HI> was black and &s;ometimes very vi&s;cid. In a lad who died of this di&s;ea&s;e in the beginning of the fourth day, and who was immediately opened, the bile was not only black, but had the con&s;i&s;tence of thick <HI>Venice</HI>-tur|pentine, and was exceedingly tough. On the in&s;ide of the &s;tomach, there were &s;everal carbuncles or gangrenous&s;pecks. And in all tho&s;e I have di&s;&s;ected, who have died of this di&s;|ea&s;e, I have not only always ob&s;erved the &s;ame, but like|wi&s;e that the blood was very fluid, and the ve&s;&s;els of the <HI>vi&s;cera</HI> much di&s;tended; from whence I have been very in|clinable to think, when the di&s;ea&s;e was not conquered in its fir&s;t <HI>&s;tadium,</HI> that, about the time of the termination of the fever, there was a <HI>meta&s;ta&s;is</HI> of the morbid matter to the <HI>vi&s;cera.</HI></NOTE> The reaching to vomit

<P N="8">8. THE inquietude was very ob&s;tinate, and when they dozed, their &s;lumbers were but &s;hort and unrefre&s;hing. There were &s;ome who were drow&s;y; but the&s;e always awaked, after the &s;horte&s;t &s;lumbers, with a great de|jection of &s;pirits and &s;trength.</P>
<P N="9">9. THE <HI>jactations</HI> or re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s was &s;ur|pri&s;ing; it was frequently &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to keep the patients in bed, though, at the &s;ame time, they did not complain of any anxiety or unea&s;ine&s;s; but if a&s;ked how they did, the reply was, <HI>Very well.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. THE <HI>debility</HI> was &s;o great, that, if the patient was rai&s;ed erect in the bed, or, in &s;ome, if the head was only rai&s;ed from the pillow, while a cup of drink was given, the pul&s;e &s;unk immediately, and became &s;ome|times &s;o &s;mall, that it could &s;carcely be felt; at this time, they became cold, as in a <HI>hor|ripilatio,</HI> but without the an&s;erine-like &s;kin:
<PB N="20" REF="035733_0019_10065E096D97F388">their &s;kin became clammy, the <HI>delirium</HI> in|crea&s;ed, their lips and &s;kin, e&s;pecially about the neck, face and extremities, together with their nails, acquired a livid colour.</P>
<P N="11">11. THE <HI>delirium</HI> returned and increa&s;ed; it was generally con&s;tant in tho&s;e who&s;e pul&s;e was &s;mall and &s;ub&s;iding.</P>
<P N="12">12. THE inflammation of the <HI>tunica con|junctiva</HI> or white of the eyes increa&s;ed much, but without pain.</P>
<P N="13">13. A <HI>yellowne&s;s</HI> in the white of the eyes, if it did not appear before in the febrile &s;tate, became now very ob&s;ervable, and that icteritious-like colour was &s;oon diffu&s;ed over the whole &s;urface of the body, and was con|tinually acquiring a deeper &s;affron-like co|lour. In &s;ome indeed no yellowne&s;s was ob|&s;ervable, excepting in the white of the eyes, until a little before death, when it increa&s;ed &s;urpri&s;ingly quick, e&s;pecially about the brea&s;t and neck.</P>
<P N="14">14. THERE were many &s;mall <HI>&s;pecks,</HI> not rai&s;ed above the &s;kin, which appeared very
<PB N="21" REF="035733_0020_10065E0CE173CC08">thick in the brea&s;t and neck; but le&s;s &s;o in the extremities, and were of a &s;carlet, purple or livid colour.</P>
<P N="15">15. IN women the <HI>men&s;trua</HI> flowed, and &s;ometimes exce&s;&s;ively, though not at their re|gular periods.</P>
<P N="16">16. THERE was &s;uch a putrid di&s;&s;olution of the blood in this <HI>&s;tadium</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e, that, be&s;ides the vomiting of blood former|ly mentioned, and the bloody urine &s;oon to be taken notice of, there were <HI>haemorrhagies</HI> from the no&s;e, mouth, ears, eyes, and from the parts which were bli&s;tered with <HI>cantha|rides.</HI> Nay, in the year 1739 or 1745, there was one or two in&s;tances of an haemorrhage from the &s;kin, without any apparent punc|ture or lo&s;s of any part of the &s;carf-&s;kin.</P>
<P N="17">17. AN ob&s;tinate <HI>co&s;tivene&s;s</HI> continued in &s;ome; in others, the &s;tools were frequent and loo&s;e; in &s;ome, they were black, li|quid, large and greatly fatiguing; in others, when the &s;tools were moderate, even though they were black, they gave great relief; in others again, the &s;tools nearly re&s;embled tar
<PB N="22" REF="035733_0021_10065E0FD3D87990">in &s;moothne&s;s, tenacity, colour and con&s;i&s;|tence.</P>
<P N="18">18. THE <HI>urine</HI> was di&s;charged in a large quantity, in proportion to the drink retain|ed by the patient: it was pale if the patient was not yellow; but if yellow, then it was of a deep-&s;affron colour; in either ca&s;e it had a &s;ediment, or at lea&s;t a large cloud, which remained at the bottom of the gla&s;s; in &s;ome, it was very turbid, in others, it was bloody, and the quantity of blood di&s;charged with the urine bore always &s;ome proportion to the &s;tate of the pul&s;e; when that became fuller, the quantity of blood in the urine was dimini&s;hed: when the pul&s;e &s;ub&s;ided, the bloody urine increa&s;ed, and even returned af|ter it had cea&s;ed &s;ome days, &s;oon after the pul&s;e became &s;maller.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e continued &s;ome|times &s;even or eight days before the patient died.</P>
<P N="9">IX. WHEN this <HI>&s;tadium</HI> (VIII.) of the di&s;|ea&s;e terminated in health, it was by a rece&s;s or abatement of the vomiting, haemorrhagies,
<PB N="23" REF="035733_0022_10065E115AE51608"><HI>delirium,</HI> inquietude, jactations, and icteri|tious-like &s;uffu&s;ion of the &s;kin and white of the eyes; while, at the &s;ame time, the pul&s;e became fuller, and the patient gained &s;trength, which, after this di&s;ea&s;e, was very &s;lowly.</P>
<P>BUT when it terminated in death, tho&s;e (VIII.) &s;ymptoms not only continued, but &s;ooner or later increa&s;ed in violence, and were &s;ucceeded with the following, which may be termed the <HI>third &s;tadium</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e, which quickly ended in death.</P>
<P N="10">X. THE pul&s;e tho' &s;oft became exceeding|ly &s;mall and unequal; the extremities grew cold, clammy and livid; the face and lips, in &s;ome, were flu&s;hed; in others, they were of a livid colour; the livid &s;pecks increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t, that in &s;ome, the whole brea&s;t and neck appeared livid; the heart palpitated &s;trongly; the heat about the <HI>praecordia</HI> in|crea&s;ed much; the re&s;piration became diffi|cult, with frequent &s;ighing; the patient now became anxious, and extremely re&s;tle&s;s; the &s;weat flowed from the face, neck and brea&s;t; blood flowed from the mouth, or
<PB N="24" REF="035733_0023_10065E12E1CE1550">no&s;e or ears, and in &s;ome, from all tho&s;e parts at once; the deglutition became diffi|cult; the hiccoughs and <HI>&s;ub&s;ultus</HI> of the tendons came on, and were frequent; the patients trifled with their fingers, and picked the naps of the bed-cloaths; they grew co|matous, or were con&s;tantly delirious. In this terrible &s;tate, &s;ome continued eight, ten or twelve hours before they died, even after they had been &s;o long &s;peechle&s;s, and with|out any perceptible pul&s;ation of the arteries in the wri&s;ts; whereas, in all other acute di&s;ea&s;es, after the pul&s;e in the wri&s;ts cea&s;es, death follows immediately. When the di&s;|ea&s;e was <HI>very</HI> acute, violent convul&s;ions &s;eized the unhappy patient, and quickly brought this <HI>&s;tadium</HI> to its fatal end. After death, the li|vid blotches increa&s;ed fa&s;t, e&s;pecially about the face, brea&s;t, and neck, and the putre|faction began very early, or rather increa&s;ed very quickly.</P>
<P N="11">XI. THIS was the progre&s;s of this terrible di&s;ea&s;e through its &s;everal <HI>&s;tadia.</HI> But in hot weather, and when the &s;ymptoms in the fir&s;t &s;tage were very violent, it pa&s;&s;ed thro' tho&s;e &s;tages, as Dr. <HI>Warren</HI> has likewi&s;e ob&s;erved,
<PB N="25" REF="035733_0024_10065E17BB60AF00">with &s;uch precipitation, that there was but little opportunity of di&s;tingui&s;hing its diffe|rent <HI>&s;tadia</HI>; the whole tragedy having been fini&s;hed in le&s;s than 48 hours.</P>
<P N="12">XII. IT was remarkable, that, 1. The infection was increa&s;ed by warm and le&s;&s;ened by cold weather. 2. The &s;ymptoms in the &s;everal <HI>&s;tadia</HI> were more or le&s;s violent, ac|cording to the heat or coolne&s;s of the wea|ther. In hot days, the &s;ymptoms were not only more violent, but in tho&s;e who &s;eemed, in moderate weather, to be on the recovery, or at lea&s;t in no danger, the &s;ymptoms were all &s;o greatly heightened, when the weather grew con&s;iderably warmer, as frequently to become fatal. In cool days, the &s;ymptoms were not only milder, but many, who were apparently in great danger in hot days, were &s;aved from the very jaws of death by the weather becoming happily cooler. 3. The di&s;ea&s;e was generally more fatal to tho&s;e who lay in &s;mall chambers not conveniently &s;itu|ated for the admi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h air, to tho&s;e of an athletic and full habit, to &s;trangers who were natives of a cold climate, to tho&s;e who had the greate&s;t dread of it, and to
<PB N="26" REF="035733_0025_10065E1946919460">tho&s;e, who, before the attack of the di&s;ea&s;e, had overheated them&s;elves by exerci&s;e in the &s;un, or by exce&s;&s;ive drinking of &s;trong li|quors; either of which indeed &s;eemed to render the body more &s;u&s;ceptible of the in|fection. La&s;tly, the di&s;ea&s;e proved mo&s;t certainly fatal to valetudinarians, or to tho&s;e who had been weakened by any previous di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. THE <HI>progno&s;tics</HI> in the fir&s;t <HI>&s;tadium</HI> are the&s;e. 1. The more acute and con&s;tant the pains are in the head, loins, knees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the more the eyes are inflamed; the greater their inability is to bear light, and the more the face is flu&s;hed at the fir&s;t attack, the fever and all the &s;ymptoms (VI.) in the fir&s;t <HI>&s;tadium</HI> will be the more violent. 2. The more inten&s;e the &s;ymptoms are in the fir&s;t &s;tate, the &s;ooner will the fever terminate. 3. The &s;ooner the di&s;ea&s;e runs thro' the fir&s;t <HI>&s;tadium,</HI> the &s;horter will be the duration of the &s;econd, and <HI>&egrave; contra.</HI> 4. The &s;horter the duration is of the fir&s;t, the greater and more certain is the danger in the &s;econd &s;tate. For when the fever terminated before the beginning of the third day, death &s;eemed
<PB N="27" REF="035733_0026_10065E1B224573E8">inevitably to be the con&s;equence, as there was then no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;upporting the pul&s;e, and as all the bad &s;ymptoms were then hurried on with &s;uch precipitation, that the patient generally died before the end of the fifth day, excepting a con&s;iderable cool|ne&s;s of the weather happily intervened; but on the contrary, it was a favourable circum|&s;tance when the fever was protracted to the end of the third day, without any remarkable hardne&s;s or depre&s;&s;ion of the pul&s;e. 5. A great depre&s;&s;ion of the pul&s;e, about the ter|mination of the fever, is bad, &s;ince, from that circum&s;tance, the vomitings, ince&s;&s;ant jactations, the coldne&s;s and lividne&s;s of the extremities, haemorrhagies, <HI>delirium, &amp;c.</HI> are u&s;hered in with &s;urpri&s;ing celerity. 6. The more the &s;trength is pro&s;trated from the fir&s;t attack, the greater is the danger. 7. A vomiting coming on early in the di&s;ea&s;e, and continuing or increa&s;ing, is bad, and generally pre&s;ages the <HI>black vomit.</HI> 8. A &s;ediment in the urine in the fir&s;t and &s;econd day of the di&s;ea&s;e is bad, and the more copious the &s;ediment is, the greater is the danger.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="28" REF="035733_0027_10065E1CA9EF2B20">XIV. THE progno&s;tics in the &s;econd <HI>&s;ta|dium</HI> are the&s;e: 1. An early yellowne&s;s in the white of the eyes is bad: when it is ob&s;ervable about the end of the &s;econd day, in the fir&s;t <HI>&s;tadium,</HI> the patient generally dies about the beginning of the fourth day from the fir&s;t attack of the di&s;ea&s;e. But when the yellowne&s;s does not appear till the end of the third day, if the patient does not re|cover, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;ometimes continues to the 9th or 10th day of the &s;econd <HI>&s;tadium</HI> before the patient dies. When the yellow|ne&s;s of the &s;kin and eyes increa&s;es fa&s;t and acquires &s;oon a deep icteritious-like colour, the greate&s;t danger is to be apprehended. 2. If the inflammation of the white of the eyes increa&s;es, it is bad. 3. The more in|flamed and bloody-like the &s;kin is where it has been bli&s;tered, the greater is the danger. 4. If the vomiting continues or increa&s;es, it is bad, but the <HI>black vomiting</HI> is generally mortal. 5. When the pul&s;e varies frequently in its fullne&s;s, being &s;ometimes &s;mall, then fuller, it is bad. But there was le&s;s de|pendence to be had on the pul&s;e in this than is common in other di&s;ea&s;es; for in &s;ome patients, in the &s;econd &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e,
<PB N="29" REF="035733_0028_10065E214643BAB0">even within a few hours of their death, the pul&s;e, with re&s;pect to its fullne&s;s, &s;oft|ne&s;s, equality and frequency, has continued like that of one in perfect health, although, from the other &s;ymptoms, the death of the patient could be foretold with great cer|tainty. 6. The more the &s;trength of the patient is reduced in the fir&s;t, the greater is the danger in the &s;econd <HI>&s;tadium.</HI> 7. Great re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, inquietude, an early <HI>delirium</HI> and a continuation of it are very bad. 8. Livid blotches about the neck and brea&s;t, a livid|ne&s;s of the lips and nails, flu&s;hing of the face, or a livid colour thereof, are &s;ure &s;igns of the quick approach of death. 9. Fre|quent loo&s;e &s;tools, which give not any re|lief, are bad, and the &s;ooner they &s;ponta|neou&s;ly happen, the greater is the danger: but tho&s;e which are black, and continue &s;o without any abatement of the &s;ymptoms, are generally mortal. 10. Bloody urine and all haemorrhagies, excepting &s;light ones from the no&s;e, are bad; and the more copious they are, the greater is the danger. But a flux of the <HI>men&s;es,</HI> though not at their regular period, if attended with an abatement of the &s;ymptoms, is a favourable circum&s;tance,
<PB N="30" REF="035733_0029_10065E22CE8EF978">otherwi&s;e it is bad. 11. A &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e, who, in the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, have had large di&s;charges that way, is a certain &s;ign of the quick approach of death.</P>
