<P>THE general de&s;ign is already known. But, as the pulpit is rather in dept to little Children, my particular de&s;ign is to preach to them. I have often thought of taking this method, to impre&s;s their tender minds with the importance of early duty, in con&s;equence of &s;eeing them &s;o atten|tive to in&s;truction, when di&s;tingui&s;hed by a particular addre&s;s: and, as often have been afraid of the attempt, left I &s;hould not treat things according to their capacities, without being too free with the public rights of others. Their little opening minds are capa|ble of receiving &s;ome of the mo&s;t im|portant truths of the go&s;pel when they are ea&s;ily connected, and plainly ex|pre&s;&s;ed. And, though I cannot claim that tenderne&s;s, and in&s;tructive &s;kill that are equal to the &s;ubject, yet I am
<PB REF="018195_0003_0FA5C02C020BE148">
induced to addre&s;s them in this public manner, becau&s;e I hope the divine ble&s;&s;ing will &s;ucceed my intention, in an&s;wer to the unwearied prayers of chri&s;tians for their &s;alvation. My hopes of &s;ome mea&s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s, are al&s;o &s;trengthened from this con&s;iderati|on, that all faithful per&s;ons who love to form the minds of little children for Chri&s;t, and give them to him with nurturing hands, will gratefully improve their advantages, in every department, to extend, and widen the&s;e in&s;tructions, and add a la&s;ting influence to them, with line upon line, and precept upon precept, repeatedly, and continually.</P>
<P>The method will contain two gene|ral branches: in the fir&s;t place, I &s;hall &s;hew children, what it is to obey their parents in the Lord: and &s;econdly in what re&s;pect, it is right or beautiful. And as the principal de&s;ign, is to give in&s;truction to little children, I take it for granted, the candid, improved mind will chu&s;e to hear them addre&s;&s;ed, in their own plain, and familiar &s;tyle: we &s;hall therefore indulge freedom of thought, and &s;implicity of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>And now, my dear children, &s;ince the &s;ermon is to be preached to you, I a&s;k your diligent and careful attention

mind, like many others, older than you, who ought to &s;et better examples. But, you mu&s;t wor&s;hip God in &s;pirit, and in truth, and love his word with all the heart; and then Chri&s;t will love you, as the tender lambs of his flock.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t branch of di&s;cour&s;e, I am to &s;hew you, what it is, to obey your parents in the Lord. And, to make it ea&s;y for you to under&s;tand. I will mention &s;ix things, which belong to the wicked cla&s;s of children, that you mu&s;t not indulge, if you intend to be dutiful.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, To be dutiful children, you mu&s;t not indulge a carele&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, re&s;pecting the directions of your pa|rents. For the carele&s;s temper is one cau&s;e of di&s;obedience. And, if you have a great deal of this temper, you will have the more di&s;obedience. Care|le&s;s children treat the directions of their parents, as though not worthy of any notice. Even while in company with them, they often hear without at|tention &amp; con&s;equently, without any more obedience to their directions, than to the blowing of the wind. And when they happen to be at a little di&s;tance, not only let them call a number of times, without giving an an&s;wer; at all
<PB N="7" REF="018195_0006_0FA5C02F01558998">
And what is this but di&s;obedience? What is it better than obedience to &s;atan? For, he per&s;uades them not to an&s;wer, that he may learn them, not only to deceive, but to tell lies al&s;o. And hence it comes to pa&s;s, when the parents have called with wearine&s;s, without receiving any an&s;wer from the child, and they enquire whether he did not hear, he has NO for an an&s;wer as quick as he can &s;peak. And when this is done, &s;atan feels highly plea&s;ed, for he has not only learned him to be care|le&s;s and deceitful, but to cover all over with a LYE. And this is &s;atan's me|thod with children&punc; he learns them one thing after another, till they be|come &s;o acquainted with &s;in, as to get by heart the mo&s;t wicked le&s;&s;on he teaches. And, as &s;oon as he prevails with children to be carele&s;s, he finds it ea&s;y to learn them to be forgetful, to de|ceive, and lye, and almo&s;t every thing he plea&s;es in a &s;hort time. You mu&s;t not then indulge a carele&s;s di&s;po&s;ition&punc; For the carele&s;s child is the undutiful one.</P>
<P>Secondly, You mu&s;t not indulge idle|ne&s;s. For the idle &s;pirit is unfriendly to obedience. The idle child cannot therefore be a dutiful one. And, idle|ne&s;s
<PB N="8" REF="018195_0007_0FA5C02FD8BF6360">
is not only a bad thing in it&s;elf, but is the cau&s;e of a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n any more. For when &s;atan finds an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e child, he will &s;oon have &s;omething for him to do that is very wicked. He has a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s, for id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e children to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndertake; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y are &s;uch fool|i&s;h, wicked little creatures, that they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ways love to do as he bid them, a thou&s;and times better than to obey their pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ents. There are many chil|dren, who obey &s;atan &s;teadily all day long, and hate with all their hearts to be obedient in the Lord. They love to e&s;cape the &s;ight of duty, and to keep at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from it: And, therefore, when a chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of this temper reads the bible, his catechi&s;m, or what|ever, his heart is &s;till in love with idle|ne&s;s. He does not love to &s;ee the &s;ab|bath&punc; if his parents keep it in a &s;trict, and holy manner, becau&s;e he takes no plea&s;ure in duty: But, if his parents di&s;regard the &s;abbath, and make it a day of idlene&s;s, in&s;tead of holy re&s;ting, then he loves to &s;ee it, for a play-day. He is very diligent at play, but has no diligence in duty. When, there|fore he is directed to do an errand, it &s;eems as though idlene&s;s, and &s;lothful|ne&s;s together, would not let him move
<PB N="9" REF="018195_0008_0FA5C03078DF2C70">
a &s;ingle &s;tep; but as &s;oon as he &s;ees an opportunity to &s;lide into play with di&s;obedient children, he is all life, and &s;pirit, and goes as fa&s;t as he can run. And, this is the child that is &s;o unfaith|ful, as &s;oon as he e&s;capes the &s;ight of his parents. He not only neglects to do as he is directed, but &s;tays a great while, though charged to return im|mediately; and frequently very much di&s;turbs the bu&s;ine&s;s of the family for &s;ome time. He acts as though he could not obey his parents too little, and &s;atan too much. In &s;hort, the idle creature is always in &s;atan's path, and the devil cannot go a along without &s;eeing him, or &s;tumbling upon him. But, how fooli&s;h is it, for a child to go, &amp; wait for the devil to come along, to give him wicked thoughts, and tell him what to do next? How fooli&s;h, did I &s;ay? Rather, how very wicked? How di&s;honorable to God, who hath made him to love, and obey his parents in the mo&s;t dutiful manner? And how de|&s;tructive to his own &s;oul? and when children will indulge the idle di&s;po&s;iti|on &amp; throw them&s;elves in &s;atan's way, they have nothing to expect, but God will give them up entirely, and let him lead them where he plea&s;es, till he
<PB N="10" REF="018195_0009_0FA5C03142F85488">
leads them blind, right down to hell. Take care then, children, and with|draw your feet from the path of idlene&s;s for it leads directly to de&s;truction. I hope you will remember, that idlene&s;s was one of the great &s;ins of Sodom, for which &s;o many people were de|&s;troyed with fire from heaven. And remember Lot's wife al&s;o, who became a pillar of &s;alt, becau&s;e &s;he was &s;o idle, as to look back, when God told her to make ha&s;te, and e&s;cape for her life, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould peri&s;h with the re&s;t of the people. You mu&s;t not then &s;tand all the day idle, with the wicked, but for|&s;ake idlene&s;s, and love diligence, or you cannot be dutiful children. But,</P>
<P>Thirdly, If you intend to obey your parents in the Lord, you mu&s;t not in|dulge the &s;pirit of anger. For "Anger re&s;teth in the bo&s;om of fools." And, fire, you not only re&s;emblethe the an|gry revengeful man, who&s;e tongue and eyes are full of poi&s;on and &s;pite, but the little malicious devils them&s;elves. You mu&s;t therefore put away anger, and wrath, and every thing of that nature: for the dutiful child is as gentle, and meek as a lamb. He has the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, and does not love to be fretful, and peevi&s;h. And nothing alarms him

no humility in their hearts till they are made new creatures, there is no|thing more common, than for them to obey their parents with his tem|per. And this is the &s;pirit, when they obey their parents only for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ake of being thought better than others. Their hearts are &s;o proud, and vain&punc; as to be delighted with empty prai&s;e. And they will often attend to the com|mands of their parents, for the &s;ake of gratifying the pride and vanity of their hearts, when nothing el&s;e is &s;ufficient to move them. But, this is poor obedi|ence indeed, becau&s;e it is performed in pride, in&s;tead of humility:&mdash;And, little children will never appear beautiful, in the &s;ight of God, who&s;e eye is fixed on the heart, till they are as humble as the du&s;t. As they are taken from the du&s;t, they can only plea&s;e God, when they feel humble, and little, and love to do their duty for the &s;ake of the holy plea&s;ure they enjoy in it. And when this humble temper prevails, like little diligent bees, which fly from one low flower to another, to collect the riche&s;t honey, wherever they can find it, &s;o humble little chidren will love to go from thing to thing, where they can &s;erve God the mo&s;t, and enjoy him
<PB N="13" REF="018195_0012_0FA5C03445117858">
the be&s;t. Vain worthle&s;s prai&s;e is very lightly e&s;teemed; and the lovely exam|ple of the little Je&s;us will be their de|light:&mdash;When Chri&s;t was a child, he loved to obey his parents, not for the &s;ake of idle prai&s;e, but becau&s;e he loved his duty.&mdash;Duty was his delight&mdash; and therefore he conducted in &s;uch a lovely inoffen&s;ive manner, with &s;o much wi&s;dom, and propriety, that as he in|crea&s;ed in &s;tature, or grew up, he in|crea&s;ed in favour with God, and man. He was loved by all, who loved the beauties of holine&s;s, and received the mo&s;t la&s;ting prai&s;es of the dutiful &s;pi|rit. Here is an example for little chil|dren that will never fade away, but grow brighter and brighter: And you mu&s;t for&s;ake pride, and follow this example, if you intend to be dutiful children, and worthy of true prai&s;e, But,</P>
<P>Fifthly, If you intend to be dutiful children, you mu&s;t not indulge &s;elfi&s;h|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s. For after all the &s;oft, and pretty names which &s;atan hath given it to deceive the world, it is the &s;ub&s;tance of all iniquity. And as the &s;elfi&s;h man, who appears to be a chri&s;tian, only be|cau&s;e he intends to be happy forever, cannot be one, &s;o the child who obeys
<PB N="14" REF="018195_0013_0FA5C03505ABBC88">
his parents, only to obtain rich clothes and fine things, cannot be dutiful. For, when a child is governed by this &s;pirit, it is not his parents he loves, but the fine things he intends to obtain from them. And, hence this kind of obedience never la&s;ts longer than the pro&s;pect of private rewards. It always looks for pay, ju&s;t like the obedience of the Jews. When Chri&s;t came into the world, and manife&s;ted his almighty power,&mdash;in &s;o many miracles,&mdash;they were very agreeably &s;truck with him indeed:&mdash;For a little time, they ap|peared to love him exceedingly, and were &s;o fond of obeying, that they intended to have made him King. But what may we &s;uppo&s;e, was the cau&s;e of &s;o much love and re&s;pect? Were they in love with his true character, or &s;omething el&s;e?&mdash;I will tell you, chil|dren, if you will attend:&mdash;They were in love with them&s;elves only, in the gratification of their unlawful de&s;ires. They were in love with &s;in, and lov|ed Chri&s;t only as the kingly &s;ervant of their plea&s;ures:&mdash;They loved them|&s;elves the mo&s;t, and Chri&s;t only to defend them from their enemies, and increa&s;e their worldly grandeur. And if he had done according to their &s;el|fi&s;h
<PB N="15" REF="018195_0014_0FA5C035D4A2C2B8">
de&s;ires, they would have loved him extremely, no doubt. But this was impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e he came to de&s;troy the kingdom of &s;atan, in&s;tead of buil|ding it up &mdash;Therefore, as &s;oon as he reproved them for their &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and told them to give away their riches to the poor, and take up the cro&s;s, and follow him in a holy manner, they were highly offended:&mdash;And not only &s;o, but told the ba&s;e&s;t lies about him they could invent. &mdash;and did every thing po&s;&s;ible to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in his character; and make every body hate him:&mdash; But this was not all, for when he, in the mo&s;t friendly loving manner, warned them of the danger of their &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, it &s;o fired their hearts with hatred, and malice, that they put him to death without pity or tears. They &s;hed the blood of God (for Chri&s;t was God) only becau&s;e he would not indulge them in &s;in. O, ungreatful man! What ha&s;t thou done! For Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave thee from hell, and give thee heaven, and when dying on the cro&s;s, prayed for thy &s;alvation! And what have you done, my children, or rather, what are you doing &s;till, who do not love Chri&s;t with all your hearts? But, let us not lo&s;e &s;ight of the Jews.
<PB N="16" REF="018195_0015_0FA5C036F0CE9930">
What was all that love and obedience good for&punc; which they &s;hewed Chri&s;t, when they intended to have put a crown upon his head, and treated him as King? It was good for nothing, becau&s;e &s;elfi&s;h:&mdash;And &s;o all &s;elfi&s;h obe|dience will change it&s;elf in&s;tantly into the mo&s;t bitter &s;pite and malice, when denied the thing it lu&s;ts after. This is the natural picture of &s;elfi&s;h religion, And, I have given you this in&s;tance, to &s;hew that all the &s;elfi&s;h obedience of children to their parents, is of no value in the &s;ight of God. There are many children, who appear to lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e their parents, and obey them, and yet have no more true obedience than the Jews had to Chri&s;t. And I believe there are not a few who have had very wrong feelings toward their parents, when they h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve been denied the things they choo&s;e. And let me tell you, that as far as you have, any of you had &s;uch hearts-ri&s;ings, in ca&s;e of a proper de|nial&punc; that you re&s;emble tho&s;e wicked creatures, who put Chri&s;t to death be|cau&s;e he would not uphold and indulge t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">em in &s;in: But if you were not &s;el|fi&s;h, you would have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the&s;e feel|ings: And in&s;tead of di&s;plea&s;ure to|ward your kind pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ents, when they re|fu&s;e to grant your unrea&s;onable reque&s;t,

you would think them the be&s;t judges of yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r wants, and re&s;t ea&s;y and con|tented. But as long as you have the &s;elfi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h di&s;po&s;ition, you will feel more or le&s;e of the unea&s;y, re&s;entful &s;pirit, even when denied things which would be your ruin, ju&s;t as wicked men feel angry with providence, when things do not an&s;wer their de&s;ires and ex|pectations. It is &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s that makes children de&s;ire, and a&s;k for things not proper for them to have; and re&s;entful when denied: It makes you unea&s;y with the things you have, and fretful that you have not more: It is this that makes &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s with the conduct of parents, which is fol|lowed with &s;o much di&s;obedience: It makes you &s;o covetous, and loth to give, as your parents direct you, to poor little children, who have nothing but poverty, and rags:&mdash;It is &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s that prevents your doing as you would be done by. In &s;hort, it is the founda|tion of di&s;obedience, and as far as you are &s;elfi&s;h, you cannot be dutiful chil|dren. It will always be in the way; And you mu&s;t not indulge it.</P>
<P>Sixthly&punc; To be dutiful children, you mu&s;t not be more afraid of correction than you are of faults. For, to be
<PB N="18" REF="018195_0017_0FA5C0380F675C00">
more afraid of correction, than of faults is to love one's &s;elf more than the com|mand and honour of God, which can|not be right. But there is a great deal of obedience, &s;uch as it is, that is wholly indebted to the fear of correc|tion, and nothing el&s;e: And, hence the undutiful child, will often do as he is directed, when at the &s;ame time, if not afraid of correction, would pay no &s;ort of attention to the matter. But the du|tiful child is as much afraid of faults as of correction: And more too, I believe we may &s;ay, as far as the dutiful di&s;po|&s;ition prevails: For he loves God with all his heart. And no rea&s;on can be gi|ven why a per&s;on, where things are wi&s;e|ly regulated, &s;hould be afraid of unde|&s;erved puni&s;hment, for God does not allow the offender to be puni&s;hed more than he de&s;erves: &mdash;And when parents, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any others, puni&s;h a child more than the offence de&s;erves, they offend God. But, I will tell you how the undutiful child will conduct, who is afraid of cor|rection, and not of faulte: &mdash;He will go to &s;chool wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n directed, and not play the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uant, le&s;t he &s;hould be corrected; when at the &s;ame time, if not afraid of correction, he would &s;pend his whole time at play, and not go into &s;chool

<P>I WILL now endeavour to &s;hew you, what di&s;po&s;itions belong to the dutiful cla&s;s of children. And, let me ob&s;erve, that the great thing is a new heart. This &s;ums up all the re&s;t.

You remember it is this&mdash;"Thou &s;halt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain"&mdash;And, how can you be obedient in the Lord i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you do not love the Lord's com|mandments? While I am &s;peak|ing of this commandment, it can|not be ami&s;s to tell you, that the breach of it, is not only a great vice, but a growing one. How often do you hear men &s;wear and cur&s;e and damn each other to hell as though they ju&s;t came up with their tongues red hot from the fire of damnation! And, how often do you hear little chil|dren who ju&s;t begin to run about &s;treet, &s;peak the language of hell plainer than any other? I doubt, my children, that you hear more of the language of hell than you do of heaven. And the rea|&s;on is this, people do not love the third commandment. See to it then, that you do not act like others, but love it. But, to pa&s;s on: How can

you be dutiful children in the ob&s;er|vance of the &s;abbath, when you are told by your parents to be good chil|dren, not to play, but attend to all the duties of it both at home and at meeting, if you do not love the fourth commandment? But as &s;oon as you love the commandment, you will love to read the bible, and all other good books; the &s;abbath will be your de|light, and all the branches of duty which belong to it will be your plea|&s;ure. For the proper direction of your parents is the commanding voice of God&punc; that points out your duty. It is ju&s;t as though you heard him &s;peak to you, as plainly as you hear it thunder.

In&s;tead of following the example of tho&s;e wicked children who &s;aw Chri&s;t when on earth and heard him &s;peak, and yet were not obedient, you mu&s;t obey him now, in loving all the directions of your parent.

people, however poor, after the exam|ple of tho&s;e children who mocked Gods prophet as he went along; &s;aying, "Go up thou bald head, go up thou bald head." For they were cur&s;ed in the name of the Lord, and torn to pieces by wild bea&s;ts&punc; for the breach of the fifth commandment. They did not love the commandment, and therefore did not chu&s;e to honour old age and reverence the good man by bowing de|cently before him. Here you have a glaring in&s;tance of the undutiful temper, and of God's di&s;plea&s;ure in con&s;equence of it. And both were written for your in&s;truction. And would you be dutiful in the &s;ight of God, when your parents direct you in the mo&s;t careful manner never to take the things of orhers with di&s;hone&s;t hearts, you mu&s;t love the eight commandment: This will make you hone&s;t worthy children.

For the love of this command is the love of truth.

For the deceitful, lying temper, and the dutiful temper do not agree any better than darkne&s;s and light. But,</P>
<P>Secondly, If you intend to be du|tiful children, you mu&s;t love repentance for all your pa&s;t di&s;obedience. It is probable you rather think, &s;ome of you, that you have not been di&s;obedient. But, if you have not new hearts you
<PB N="29" REF="018195_0028_0FA5C0428A8CE5B0">
have been very di&s;obedient in the &s;ight of God, however you have appeared to others: &mdash; You have violated the fifth commandment a great many times. &mdash; And, without the mo&s;t heaaty repen|tance, you are &s;till going on in the di&s;|obedient path. A Child who is dutiful at pre&s;ent, is al&s;o penitent for all pa&s;t di&s;obedience. And if you de&s;ire to know what repentance is, or what you mu&s;t do to repent, I will tell you as plainly as I can. It is to &s;hun &s;in in|&s;tead of indulging it in your hearts:&mdash; Thus when parents direct dutiful chil|dren not to keep company with the wicked&punc; they are very careful to e&s;cape their company, and avoid it by every method that is lawful. They are a|fraid to tru&s;t their hearts in the com|pany of the wicked, le&s;t they &s;hould be tempted to evil. But, penitent obe|dient children love the company of each other for the &s;ake of that &s;weet fellow&s;hip and agreement, which al|ways take place between them. As birds of a feather flock together, &s;o good children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to meet, and con|ver&s;e about God, and Chri&s;t and eter|nal things. And you may always know a good child by his company; and a wicked child two. For one
<PB N="30" REF="018195_0029_0FA5C04421AEB610">
makes choice of good company, and the other of bad. And, as &s;oon as it is evident that a child loves the company of wicked children, there is great dan|ger of his ruin. And it is high time for his parents to take the be&s;t care of him they are able, le&s;t his de&s;truction &s;hould be charged to their neglect. I could give you the hi&s;tory of a little boy&punc; if I had opportunity, who cho&s;e the company of wicked children and was bent upon keeping &s;uch company, contrary to the directions and mo&s;t po&s;itive commands of his kind parents. And the longer he kept bad company, the more di&s;obedient he grew: For God gave him up to be di&s;obedient. At length he was too hardened to li&s;ten to his mother, or regard his father. He came to the years of di&s;cretion with|out any di&s;cretion, and not a better man than child. For he was &s;o ba&s;e and ungrateful&punc; as to mock his weeping mother when &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her tears and concern re&s;pecting him: and not only &s;o, but in a &s;hort time was &s;uch a daring mon&s;ter, as not only to threaten, but &s;trike his father in the face if he offered to reprove him. The kind aged father was grieved and cut to the heat to &s;ee his undutiful &s;on, but was
<PB N="31" REF="018195_0030_0FA5C044C24204A8">
obliged to let him alone; for it was dangerous to &s;peak to him, he had &s;uch a &s;piteful malicious temper. And what may we &s;uppo&s;e has become of &s;uch a creature? But there are more &s;ad examples of this nature than one. And it is not &s;trange, for there are a great many di&s;obedient children. And, if God &s;hould leave all di&s;obedient chil|dren to conduct in this manner, to de|&s;troy them&s;elves quickly, as he ju&s;tly might, the world wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;oon be full of &s;uch painful &s;ights. And let me tell you therefore, if you &s;ee the danger of early di&s;obedience, you are under grea|ter obligation to repent of it immeadi|ately. And I hope you will remember, that to repent of di&s;obedience, you mu&s;t become obedient; and to repent of chu&s;ing bad company, you mu&s;t leave it and chu&s;e good company. So you mu&s;t repent of all wicked cour&s;es by for&s;aking them, and chu&s;ing tho&s;e that are good. And then you will have that repentance which is the con|&s;tant companion of the dutiful temper. But, Thirdly, If you intend to be du|tiful chidren, you mu&s;t love to be &s;orry for your di&s;obedience. And if you only attend a moment, you will &s;ee the rea|&s;onablene&s;s of it. For you have been

great &s;inners already, though you are little&punc; not only, in breaking the fifth commandment, but in many other things. You are apt to think, I &s;up|po&s;e&punc; your &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s are very &s;mall. But this is not true:&mdash; For your &s;ins are all committed again&s;t the great God.

There is no &s;uch thing as a little &s;in: &mdash;Some &s;ins, it is true, are greater than others, but every &s;in de&s;erves God's wrath and cur&s;e both in this life, and that which is to come. Your &s;ins are great, like mountains upon mountains, not only higher than the clouds, and &s;tars, but infinitely high. And they are more in number than the hairs of your heads. The angels them|&s;elves, who&s;e knowledge is &s;o exten&s;ive, are not able to &s;ee the greatne&s;s of one little child's &s;in, becau&s;e it is commit|ted again&s;t the infinitely great Je|hovah. How &s;orry then &s;hould you be for &s;in? It is impo&s;&s;ible for your hearts to be too full of the deepe&s;t &s;orrow. And, when God gives you dutiful hearts, you will feel &s;orry, that you will hardly know what to do with your&s;elves:&mdash;
<PB N="33" REF="018195_0032_0FA5C0482E6FAA30">
Sin will be your greate&s;t burden: &mdash;Sor|row will lye down with you. and pre|vent your &s;leep for hours together:&mdash;It will ri&s;e with you, and feel like a heavy pre&s;&s;ing weight on your hearts. So I &s;uppo&s;e the good child's heart is &s;orry for &s;in, all night, while he is a&s;leep. Godly &s;orry cannot be &s;lept away: &mdash; For it lives in the heart day and night, con&s;tantly. The good child is grieved, and out to the heart, that his kind pa|rents have been &s;o much di&s;honored by his pa&s;t di&s;obedience. He cannot for|give him&s;elf, that he hath been &s;o care|le&s;s, idle, &amp; ob&s;tinate; &s;o pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, &amp; &s;el|fi&s;h; and &s;o much in love with di&s;o|bedience, as not to be afraid of any thing, but correction in con&s;equence of it.&mdash;And more than this, he won|ders &s;ome times, that God can &s;pare him a &s;ingle moment&punc; and does not cut the thread of life, and let the weight of his &s;ins carry him down in&s;tantly to hell. He not only &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, but FEELS it to be entirely ju&s;t for&punc; God to puni&s;h him and all offenders, as their &s;ins de|&s;erve. Thus he lies low in the du&s;t be|fore a ju&s;t and holy God, who is infinite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y offended with him for &s;in.&mdash;He looks up and admires the patience of God that prevents his fal|ling;
<PB N="34" REF="018195_0033_0FA5C048A71BE2F8">
he looks down, and plainly &s;ees what he de&s;erves, and does not feel rea|dy to complain, if God's patience &s;hould come to an end, and let him fall into the hands of &s;trict ju&s;tice, and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ap the wages of &s;in. And when he feels in this manner, it is his choice to be wholly at the di&s;po&s;al of an infinitely ju&s;t, and merciful God, who can do no wrong. He is not afraid to tru&s;t him|&s;elf entirely in the hand of God, be|fore he knows what he will do with him. As he de&s;erves no good, he feels that God would not treat him unju&s;tly to give him none, and that infinite mercy only can prevent all po&s;&s;ible evils. Thus, my children, let me tell you and I hope you will remember it, all per&s;ons feel who have new hearts, while they are thinking in a particular manner of God's ju&s;tice, and their own &s;infulne&s;s. And I hope you will all know, what it is to have the&s;e feelings of heart. For you cannot be dutiful children, and chri&s;tians without. But let us h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ten to the next thing, for the connection between true &s;orrow and joy is quicker than we can &s;peak.</P>

It would be wrong for men to continue &s;inners, if no &s;alvation were provided for them at all. For, &s;in is an unrea&s;on|able thing. No one can ju&s;tify Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m for attempting to hide from God, and remaining his enemy a &s;ingle moment after he fell, though he &s;aw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;alva|tion offered, and nothing but de&s;truc|tion before him. For you can ea&s;ily tell, if a&s;ked, what el&s;e he &s;hould have done. Nor can we ju&s;tify the wicked &s;pirits in hell for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing God any lon|ger, though he has no mercy for them.

They not only &s;ay their prayers, like little parrots, but pray with their hearts. They are peni|tent, and humble, and love the things they a&s;k for. When they a&s;k for mercy, they love mercy. They love and reverence the holy name of Chri&s;t, in which they pray. And, it is a great grief to them, that they have no more repentance, and humility in their prayers. They tremble at the thought of a&s;king ami&s;s.

You cannot tire God with holy prayer. And he will hear you pray at any time, and in any place whatever. As God is every where, you may pray any where.

For, as the natural appetite of children will lead them to a&s;k their parents, for common food; &s;o the holy appetite, and de&s;ires of good children, will lead them to a&s;k their heavenly father every day for the bread of life. Hence, my children, when you feel appetites for natural food, night, and morning, it &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d make you think of your needy &s;ouls, which will peri&s;h without the bread of life.

Therefore God &s;ays, "Let not that man think that he &s;hall receive any thing of the Lord." If you do not love Chri&s;t God will not love your prayers. But, I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome of you are ready to make the common, and idle excu&s;e, that you have no time to pray. But let me in|treat you not to make this excu&s;e any more, unle&s;s you have no time to die, whether prepared or unprepared, I lately read the account of a little boy eleven years old, who often continued

This child found time to pray becau&s;e he loved it. It was his delight. And if prayer was your delight, you would find time al&s;o. For, God hath mo&s;t certainly given us as much time as duty &mdash;He hath not commanded us to do any thing, with|out allowing &s;ufficient time for the per|formance. But, if you &s;till think you have not time to pray, let me a&s;k you a little &s;hort que&s;tion; Have you time to play? The que&s;tion is an&s;wered.&mdash; And, what if you &s;hould only &s;pend half of the time in &s;weet humble prayer to God that you &s;pend, every day at play, what different children would you be?

<P>SECONDLY, I mu&s;t now fulfil my promi&s;e, and &s;hew in what re|&s;pects it is right, or beautiful, for children to obey their parents in the Lord.

conduct can &s;peak the be&s;t for it|&s;elf. But in what this beauty con&s;i&s;ts, I will attempt to &s;hew in the follow|ing particulars.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it is right for children to obey their parents in the Lord, becau&s;e they are &s;o much indebted to them. God has made children greatly in debt to their parents indeed. Children are brought into the world by their pa|rents; and are little parts of their bodies, as limbs and branches are lit|tle parts of the tree.</P>
<P>They are therefore in debt to them for their very beings. And not only &s;o, but in debt for all the early f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vours of life. God fir&s;t gives good things to parents, and then di&s;po&s;es them to imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt to their children: And things are &s;o wi&s;ely ordered, that parents can no more forget their children than them&s;elves. They &s;eem to love them as tenderly as them&s;elves. And, as little infants, and children, are &s;o feeb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and helple&s;s, that they cannot take care of them&s;elves, what a great favour is it, that God hath given di&s;po&s;itions to parents, to take care of them as they need. Little infants are &s;ome of the mo&s;t helple&s;s creatures in the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld. Some little creatures can take
<PB N="47" REF="018195_0046_0FA5C0530D7F17E8">
care of them&s;elves very early. But, if parents do not take the greate&s;t care of their children when they fir&s;t come into the world, they &s;oon go out of it again.&mdash;</P>
<P>The tender mother, who loves to hold the little babe in her arms, and feed, and nouri&s;h it, is made u&s;e of in pro|vidence, to &s;ave its life.&mdash;And no one, I &s;uppo&s;e, but tender parents them&s;elves, has any ju&s;t views of the care and concern that are due to chil|dren, not only when infants, but for a number of years together, before they are fit to act for them&s;elves. And as children require a great deal of atten|tion, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, how much they would &s;uffer, and how &s;oon they would peri&s;h, if neglected. What would be|come of you, if father and mother were taken away, and God &s;hould not leave any kind per&s;on to take care of your little bodies and minds? You would &s;oon become little ragged, naked crea|tures. And not only &s;o; but very ig|norant too, and greatly expo&s;ed in|deed to de&s;truction. You therefore &s;ee, as you receive &s;o many favours f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om your parents that you are under great obligations to obey them. And, when you only remember, that all the&s;e fa|vours
<PB N="48" REF="018195_0047_0FA5C053DF3C8560">
come to you from God, only through the hands of your parents, it is altogether right to obey them in the Lord. O, how good is God to little children, to open his bountiful hand &s;o often to them, in the kindne&s;s they receive from their parents! And how grateful and dutiful &s;hould they be when they think of it? And how often &s;hould they think of it? Therefore, when dutiful brothers, and &s;i&s;ters think of the con&s;tant love and attention of parents, in&s;tead of being afraid, like undutiful children, that they &s;hall do too much for them, they never think they can do enough. And they often have little virtuous contentions among them&s;elves, who &s;hall do the mo&s;t, and be the be&s;t child. And how charming is &s;uch a &s;ight? But, above all things when they remember the goodne&s;s of God, in &s;ending Chri&s;t into the world with his grace, and giving pare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts to train them up for him; how obedient will they be to their parents for Chri&s;t's &s;ake? They will love Chri&s;t becau&s;e they are baptized in his holy name, and honor their parents for his &s;ake, becau&s;e he hath di&s;po&s;ed their hearts to devote them &s;o early to God. They love to find them&s;elves the children of
<PB N="49" REF="018195_0048_0FA5C05482384490">
chri&s;tian parents, and members of Chri&s;t's baptized and &s;ealed family. And like young Jo&s;ian, and little Ti|mothy, they early drink in the truths of &s;cripture, and become wi&s;e unto &s;al|vation. In &s;hort, the&s;e children feel &s;o full of gratitude to God for their pa|rents, and favour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they receive from them, that they don't know how to expre&s;s it fa&s;t enough, even in dutiful obedience. And we need only a&s;k the que&s;tion:&mdash;How beautiful is it for the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thus to conduct? But,</P>
<P>Secondly, It is right for children to obey their parents in the Lord, that they may be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t them as they grow old and helple&s;s. As the wi&s;dom of providence hath made little children dependent on parents; &s;o the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me providence hath made aged help|le&s;s parents dependent on their chil|dren. And, they are as much obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t their aged parent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a help|le&s;s &s;tate, as their parents were to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their infancy. And, the only way to be properly prepared, to take a &s;uitable care of aged parents, when they need as much waiting upon al|mo&s;t as infants, is for children to be|come dutiful. If you now love your parents in a dutiful manner, you will be plea&s;ed with an opportunity of wai|ting
<PB N="50" REF="018195_0049_0FA5C0553ACB9ED8">
upon them when they cannot help them&s;elves.&mdash;For dutiful children always make kind and tender hearted men, e&s;pecially to helple&s;s parents. And, as aged people lo&s;e tho&s;e pretty engaging actions that belong to chil|dren, and become a burden to them|&s;elves, and often to others, you will need very dutiful hearts to di&s;po&s;e you to wait upon them as God requires. And if you have not dutiful hearts, you will probably neglect them a great many times, when they will &s;tand in great need of your be&s;t kindne&s;&s;es. But, if you have dutiful di&s;po&s;itions, you will always embrace an opportu|nity to comfort and help them, with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure.&mdash;You will love to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end them when &s;ick, and to &s;upply them if poor: and when old age makes them children in under&s;tanding, and mere infants in &s;trength, you will be as kind to them as though they were your own children. And this is beau|tiful, for the kindne&s;s of children to old people is one of their be&s;t comforts: Whereas the lea&s;t neglect grieves and wounds their hearts.&mdash;You may remem|ber this, that the dutiful &s;on treats his aged helple&s;s parents, as he would wi&s;h to be treated if one him&s;elf. He loves the golden rule, and conducts accor|dingly,
<PB N="51" REF="018195_0050_0FA5C0560057AD50">
which makes his conduct ap|pear &s;o beautiful toward his childi&s;h parents. And if you intend to make this your rule, and wi&s;h to have things mea&s;ured out to you in old age by it, you &s;hould now take hold of it with your hearts, and be dutiful little chil|dren. Thridly, It is right for chil|dren to obey their parents in the Lord, that they may be the riche&s;t ble&s;&s;ings to each other. As brothers, and &s;i&s;t|ers are as near alike as nature can make them, like &s;o many branches of the &s;ame tree, they &s;hould re&s;emble each other in love. Yes, little brothers and &s;i&s;ters, who&s;e features and actions have &s;uch a re&s;emblance, as to be the very images of their fathers, and pictures of their mothers, &s;hould all be alike in love and friend&s;hip. All their little hearts &s;hould make but one. And then they would be brothers and &s;i&s;ters in|deed, and the lovelie&s;t little creatures in the world. Therefore the &s;cripture &s;ays,
<Q>Behold how good, and how plea&s;ant it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity.</Q>
It is like holy oil, and the mo&s;t refre&s;hing dews. It is not only a little picture of the family of Chri&s;t on earth, but of heaven it&s;elf, that is full of love and unity. And the only way for children to live together
<PB N="52" REF="018195_0051_0FA5C0581CACED58">
in this &s;weet and lovely manner is to be dutiful to their parents. For, if they are de&s;titute of dutiful love, they will be of brotherly love al&s;o. The lattex cannot exi&s;t without the former. Un|dutiful children have &s;uch unfriendly hearts that they have no holy plea|&s;ure in a&s;&s;i&s;ting one another, when there is an opportunity. But, rather chu&s;e to vex and cro&s;s each other. And, hence it comes to pa&s;s, that the peace of the family is often di&s;turbed with their contentions and quarrels. And it is often in vain for parents to attempt to make peace and friend&s;hip between them, when they are little, for they do not love their parents will enough to li&s;ten to their coun&s;el and directions. And, when they grow up&punc; in&s;tead of living together in love and friend&s;hip, they live in envy and malice hateful and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing one another. The&s;e are the contentious children who have &s;o much difficulty in &s;ettleing the e&s;tate that is left by their parents. It is frequently the ca&s;e, as &s;oon as the fa|ther is dead, and buried, and hardly cold in the grave, that the con&s;uming fire of brotherly contention is blown up about their portions. One wants the mo&s;t of the e&s;tate, and the other mo&s;t, and a third at heart wants it all,
<PB N="53" REF="018195_0052_0FA5C05848F601A0">
though a&s;hamed to mention it. And thus the fire &s;oon becomes too great for them to manage. And, if kind neigh|bours cannot quench it, and &s;ettle matters betwen them, the law mu&s;t take it in hand, and end the &s;trife.&mdash;But after all they hate each other, as long as they live: and often die with hatred in their hearts, and go to hell. You then &s;ee that you cannot be loving bro|thers and &s;i&s;ters when little, and imu|tual ble&s;&s;ings afterwards, without the dutiful temper. But, if you become dutiful when little, you will live toge|ther in peace and harmony like friend|ly birds and doves, without any con|tention. And &s;urely if birds can live together in the &s;ame ne&s;t without &s;trife little borthers and &s;i&s;ters, &s;hould fill the hou&s;e with nothing but love.</P>
<P>Fourthly, It is right that you &s;hould obey your parents in the Lord, that you may be ble&s;&s;ings to all men. Chil|dren are not only under obligations to be ble&s;&s;ings to their parents, to each other, and the families where they live but to be ble&s;&s;ings to every body. But without the dutiful &s;pirit, you will not. For in&s;tance, when the undutiful child gets into the company of others, in&s;tead of learning them to be dutiful from his example, he will learn them the contrary, as far as his influence
<PB N="54" REF="018195_0053_0FA5C05905B3D6C0">
reaches. As one &s;inner de&s;troys much good, &s;o one bad child often &s;poils a whole family of children; and fre|quently all the children of his acquain|tance &mdash;
<Q>Evil communication cor|rupts good manners.</Q>
Hence if you would be a ble&s;&s;ing to other children, you mu&s;t &s;et them good examples, and not bad ones.</P>
<P>BUT let us, my children, look a lit|tle forward:&mdash;What will &s;oon become of the world, if children all make their appearance in public life with unduti|ful tempers? For, as the fruits of the earth drop off every fall, and leave their litle &s;eeds to come up in the &s;pring, to produce more; &s;o old people drop away very fa&s;t; and, if children, like little tender plants, and blades, do not ri&s;e up with&punc; dutiful di&s;po&s;itions, to fill their vacant places, there is rea&s;on to fear, the world will &s;oon be very ripe for de&s;truction. For, we have nothing to expect of undutiful children, as fa&s;t as they arrive at manhood, but the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|&s;onous fruits of the unholy temper. We may not only expect to &s;ee th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> make profane ma&s;ters, and prayerl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> parents, but the mo&s;t impious rulers, who take the &s;horte&s;t way &s;atan can think of to ruin all branches of &s;ociety. It is but a little way that undutiful children have to go in the path of &s;in,
<PB N="55" REF="018195_0054_0FA5C05A8ACB7168">
before &s;wearing, cur&s;ing, and gaming, are the mo&s;t plea&s;ant practices. The open violation of God's holy law be|comes their amu&s;ement and common diver&s;ion. And not only &s;o, but a few years in the devil's &s;chool, will learn a youth to laugh at hell, &s;port with de|&s;truction, deny the bible, de&s;y death, and murder him&s;elf, and others, to be happy. O take care!</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, what can be more promi&s;ing and beautiful, than to &s;ee children ri&s;ing up with the dutiful temper? For pre&s;ently, like little tender buds and blo&s;&s;oms in the &s;pring, they will yield the rich|e&s;t fruits. They will be the joy and crown of their parents, the hope of families, and the firme&s;t pillars of the church and &s;tate. I am willing, my little hearers, you &s;hould know that you are very capable members of &s;ocie|ty. The u&s;efulne&s;s of aged people is al|mo&s;t pa&s;t: But little more can be expected from them. Our expectations are placed on the ri&s;ing generation. And, we hope that &s;ome of you at lea&s;t will be the fine&s;t men and women in the world. Nor do we hope in vain, if you now become little chri&s;|tians. For, if God &s;hould &s;pare your lives, and lead you into public life, you will be the jewels and orna|ments
<PB N="56" REF="018195_0055_0FA5C05B62C663B8">
of the age. And if all little children were to follow the lovely ex|ample, the temple of God would be as wide as the world, and time it&s;elf would almo&s;t &s;tand &s;till, to hear them &s;ing the &s;weat ho&s;anna,
<Q>Be&s;&s;ed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</Q>
And let us thank God with all our hearts, that the time is coming, when all the little children on earth will be holy. For the world will be ble&s;&s;ed indeed. It will be heaven upon earth. In the mean time therefore let us be holy, and pray God to ha&s;ten on that glorious day. For he hath promi&s;ed that Chri&s;t &s;hall &s;ee the fruits of his love. And when providence is ready, it will &s;hine. But,</P>
<P>Fifthly, I have one thing more to mention, and I &s;hall clo&s;e: It is right for little children to obey their parents in the Lord, that they may be ready for an early death. You &s;hould be entirely willing to die, as &s;oon as God plea&s;es. Nor can you be ready too &s;oon. You have often heard your pa|rents &s;ay, the young may die &s;oon; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut the old mu&s;t.

<PB N="57" REF="018195_0056_0FA5C05C015FC6B0">
for time to come till we find it gone and out of &s;ight. It is but a little di&s;|tance from the cradle to the grave. A hand's breadth only. As &s;oon as we begin to live, we begin to die. Short is the &s;pace between the weeping in|fant, and the dying old man. But &s;horter &s;till between the birth and death of the &s;ame child. And no age e&s;capes death. It mows down old and young. The great and &s;ilent congregation of the dead is made up of all ages, and &s;izes of mankind; and if you think of it when w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lking over their &s;leeping du&s;t, you will notice many little &s;hort graves among the re&s;t. The ground is opened for little coffins as well as others. And I &s;up|po&s;e &s;ome of your little brothers, and &s;i&s;ters, died before your pre&s;ent age, and by this time are mouldered away to du&s;t. And you &s;hould remember, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gh you are &s;o young you may yet die, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the grave before your aged pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nts.

But, as lit|tle tender plants, and flowers are often pin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed, and killed with an untimely fro&s;t; &s;o the cold hand of death may
<PB N="58" REF="018195_0057_0FA5C05CC7F51430">
&s;uddenly take you away while little. As I hinted at fir&s;t, you may not live to &s;ee another &s;abbath, nor another day. Death and health are not &s;o far apart, as you &s;ometimes think. There is often but a &s;tep between them. And not only &s;o, but you may be well and dead the &s;ame moment. Time and eternity join: And you may go from life to endle&s;s happine&s;s or mi&s;|&s;ery the &s;ame in&s;tant. How very im|portant then is it&punc; to be prepared for &s;udden death? You mu&s;t then be dutiful children. For, if you die without this &s;pirit, what will become of your poor &s;ouls? You will not be carried to heaven in the arms of kind angels, but you mu&s;t be &s;ent down to hell. And there you will lye in tor|ment till the judgment of the great day. Then you will be brought up in di&s;|tre&s;s, and angui&s;h to be condemned, and forced immediately down again, with all the devils and damned crea|tures.

You, and Judas, and all lo&s;t creatures will wi&s;h you had never been born. For, to be in hell will be un&s;peakable wor&s;e, than not to be
<PB N="59" REF="018195_0058_0FA5C05D8AEAA5B0">
at all. It is, in &s;hort, infinitely better not to be, than to be, and be damned. For, when you have been in hell as many millions of years, as there are &s;tars in the &s;kies, and as many mil|lions more as there are drops of wa|ter in the &s;ea and little grains of du&s;t in the whole earth; after all this your torment will be only ju&s;t begun, and no nearer the end. Can you bear it? O, no!! For you cannot even bear your hand in the fire a &s;ingle mo|ment. What then will your poor &s;ouls do in hell? But I told you of this before, and don't know how to think of it. Yet this mu&s;t be your portion if you will not be dutiful: For God is &s;o holy, and powerful that you cannot e&s;cape his wrath if you live in &s;in.</P>
<P>BUT, if you obey your parents in the Lord, you will be ready to die at any time whatever. And if Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;end the me&s;&s;enger of death to call you this night before the bar of God, in&s;tead of being frighted at the pro&s;pect, you might think of it with plea&s;ure: And &s;ay as a little child did once to her parents, while weeping over her, ju&s;t before &s;he left the world. "My dear father and mother, don't mourn for me: You might well mourn for me if I were to go into utter darkne&s;s;
<PB N="60" REF="018195_0059_0FA5C05E426910C0">
but I am going to God in heaven. I long to be with the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. O Lord let thy angels come and carry me." What a lovely child was this? But all children who love Chri&s;t may die in this manner. For the love of Chri&s;t triumphs over death, takes away its &s;ting, and makes the king of terrors appear as peaceable as a lamb. For if you die with the dutiful &s;pirit, you will not be dragged down to hell by hateful devils, but the King of Glory will open the door of heaven and the loving angels will carry you immediatly in. And all the ble&s;&s;ed company will rejoice, and meet you with open arms. A heaven, of eternal love and friend&s;hip will be your home. You will love God and he will love you.&mdash; You will be his children, and he will be your father. All will be love and happine&s;s. In this world you are ex|po&s;ed to &s;in, pain di&s;tre&s;s, and death, but none of the&s;e will enter with you into heaven. They all belong to the other &s;tate. In one word, you will be as holy and happy as children can be. For you will be like Chri&s;t, and will live with him, and enjoy him mo&s;t &s;weetly forever.
<PB N="61" REF="018195_0060_0FA5C05EF66C3488">
What then can be more beautiful, than for children to obey their parents in the Lord? What more lovely than to glorify God and enjoy him forever. For this is the chief end of man.</P>
<P>But, as hinted before, I cannot &s;hew how beautiful it is for children to obey their parents in the Lord. It is one of the &s;weet beauties of holine&s;s.

I thank the Lord, for all pa&s;t, and pre&s;ent favors, and humbly a&s;k for more, becau&s;e it is thy plea&s;ure to &s;upply the poor, and needy. Forgive therefore the &s;ins of this day and all my life. I am a great &s;inner, yet O God de&s;troy me not in thy righteous di&s;plea&s;ure, but &s;ave me for the &s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t&punc; who hath died, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat repenting returning &s;inners might live. When thou make&s;t up thy jewels, let me be found with them, and read my name in the book of life. And now, O Lord, take a fatherly care of me this night, for I leave my&s;elf, &s;oul and body with thee. Save me from di&s;tre&s;s, remove approaching danger, and prevent all midnight outcries, and alarms. Give me kind, and refre&s;hing &s;leep. And, while I clo&s;e my eyes to &s;leep, let me not forget that they will &s;oon be clo&s;ed in death. Pre&s;erve me through the night, and if it plea&s;e thee, open my eyes to &s;ee the chearful light of the moining. I a&s;k for life to &s;pend in obedience to thy commands. I de&s;ire it for duty only. Let me not live in vain.

<P>GREAT and glorious God, ble&s;&s;ed be thy name, for the light of another morning&punc; and ble&s;&s;ed be thy Son's name, for the gracious light, and beauty of the Sabbath. Thy mercy, O Lord, is infinite! And, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ugh I &s;hall forever ex|pre&s;s the high prai&s;es of redeeming love, like a child yet accept of my pre&s;ent thankfulne&s;s, that there is &s;alvation for &s;inners. There is no love, like the love of Chri&s;t: for, by his obedience and &s;uffering, a door is opened for the full exerci&s;e of divine mercy, in the great and glorious plan, and the work of redemption. And, as this day is &s;et apart for religious &s;ervice, to honour the great Redeemer, who is Lord of the Sabbath, give me thy early pre|&s;ence, that I may &s;pend it, in a holy manner. Take off my affections from the vanities of the world, and prepare me for this clo&s;et duty, in which I am now engaged. Fit me for morning meditations&mdash;for all the duties of the family, and for the entertainments and delights of thy hou&s;e. Reach me therefore thy guiding hand, and lead me to the &s;anctuary. Let me not &s;peak my own words, nor think my own thoughts while going to thy hou&s;e, nor indulge an idle de&s;ire in it. Open my ears to hear the truth, with attention; and enlarge my heart to embrace it. Give me grace to wor&s;hip thee in &s;pirit, and in truth that my &s;ervice may be acceptable. Deliver me from the lying lip, the flattering tongue and the ab|&s;ent

And, O Lord, in thy great mercy, let him be made a rich ble&s;&s;ing to poor &s;inners, who will not come to Chri&s;t. O God, be in the mid&s;t of a&s;&s;embly, &amp; &s;hew us the beauties of holine&s;s: and fill the hou&s;e with thy glory.

<P>O LORD&punc; thou art the fir&s;t, and la&s;t, the greate&s;t, and be&s;t of be|ings. Thou art the God and Father of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Father of mer|cy.

and young, rich and poor, bond and free, without money and without price, if they will only accept of it. Who, O Lord, can utter the prai&s;es of divine love to &s;uch a &s;inful, ungrateful world! But while I attempt to thank thee for thy infinite love to my fellow creatures in general, let me be truly grateful, for the numberle&s;s favours, I am made the partaker of in particular. From morn|ing 'till night&punc; and from one Sabbath to another, thy great mercies con&s;tant|ly attend me. I thank thee, O Lord, for all the mercies I have experienced, and particularly for the privilege and advantage of this day. The rich trea|&s;ures of go&s;pel grace, have once more been opened to my &s;oul, in the preach|ing of the word. And, now O Lord, let me not prove a forgetful hearer but enable me to live according to the rules, and directions of the go&s;pel, and bring forth much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ruit. May I live like tho&s;e who have been with Je&s;us, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re ac|quainted with him at heart, and love to imitate his example. Suffer me not be weary of the Sabbath, and with an idle heart, rejoice to &s;ee it pa&s;s, though never to return.

the holy day, in a holy manner. And when this Sabbath is pa&s;t let me de&s;ire another. And thus let me de&s;ire, and &s;pend one Sabbath after another, as long as I live: and then let me enter into that re&s;t with Chri&s;t, and begin that Sabbath which will never end. O God, look upon me in the riches of thy love to children, and &s;trengthen the&s;e little feeble de&s;ires, and make me &s;trong in the Lord. O wa&s;h me clean in the blood of the Lamb.

Now to God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the great Jehovah, be given undivided and eternal prai&s;e. AMEN and AMEN.</P>
