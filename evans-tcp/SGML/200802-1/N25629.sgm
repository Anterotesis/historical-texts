<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE TRIAL AND PROCEEDINGS AGAINST CHARLES M'MANUS, JOHN HAUER, AND OTHERS FOR THE MURDER OF FRANCIS SHITZ; &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT &s;eems, pretty generally, to have been the practice to publi&s;h the mo&s;t remarkable trials in capital and other criminal ca&s;es, to gratify the public curio&s;ity; and more e&s;pecially tho&s;e which have excited, at the time, any con&s;iderable attention, ari&s;ing either from the remarkable circum&s;tances attending them, or the importance of the que&s;tion tried, e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ome great public or con&s;titutional que&s;tion. The bulk of the &s;tate trials in that country from which we have derived our laws and mode of trial, and the numerous editions of that immen&s;e work, furni&s;h convincing evidence of the great attention which has hitherto been given to &s;uch publications.</P>
<P>Among the many dreadful murders and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, with the hi&s;tory and trial of which a con&s;iderable portion of the work ju&s;t &s;poken of is taken up, there are few, if any, which appear to have been more cruelly and deliberately contrived than the bloody deed which will be detailed in the following &s;heets.</P>
<P>CHARLES M'MANUS, PETER M'DONOGHY, PATRICK DONAGAN and FRANCIS COX, were natives of Ireland, from whence they had but lately come into the United States.</P>
<P>JOHN HAUER was born in the country of Northampton, in Penn&s;ylvania, of German parents. Not many years pa&s;t he intermarried with ELIZABETH, the &s;i&s;ter of the decea&s;ed FRANCIS SHITZ, and daughter of PETER SHITZ,
<PB N="4" REF="034040_0005_0FFA47498A58AE80">

By his will he had devi&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, one thou&s;and pounds, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the advancements he had previou&s;ly made to her were, to be con&s;idered as part payment of that legacy. The whole re&s;idue of a very large e&s;tate he had bequeathed to his two &s;ons FRANCIS and PETER; with this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> direction, that in ca&s;e of the death of either of his &s;ons under age, OR without i&s;&s;ue, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> &s;hould go to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;urviving brother&mdash;paying, in &s;uch event, an additional &pound;.50<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his &s;aid daughter ELIZABETH. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">FRANCIS SHITZ had attained his age but &s;hortly before the murder was committed. PETER SHITZ is not yet more than 18 years of age. The&s;e two boys formed the only ob&s;tacles to bar JOHN HAUER and ELIZABETH his wife, from the enjoyment of the whole e&s;tate of old PETER SHITZ. This &s;hort account of the &s;ituation of the family and e&s;tate, at once di&s;clo&s;es the ba&s;e motives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> JOHN HAUER to contrive a mo&s;t diabolical &s;y&s;tem of wicked|ne&s;s, the murder of the two brothers of his wife; the half of which dreadful purpo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fatally accompli&s;hed in the de&s;truction of FRANCIS SHITZ.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> after the murder was committed, the public &s;u&s;picion was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon JOHN HAUER&mdash;and he was committed to gaol on the following day.

The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mind was extremely agitated and alarmed; and the cir|cum&s;tances of &s;o many being concerned, and the combination &s;o long and &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> concealed, gave great unea&s;ine&s;s to the people: Nor could any one be in&s;ured again&s;t injuries to him&s;elf, and the violation of his property from a hardened and re&s;olute &s;et of men, &s;trangers in the country, who&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> characters were unknown, and who were now &s;uppo&s;ed to be leagued together for the purpo&s;es of murder and pillage, as occa&s;ion or opportunity might offer.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of things, and in expectation of a full and true di&s;clo&s;ure of every fact relative to this dreadful tran&s;action, it was thought prudent by
<PB N="5" REF="034040_0006_0FFA475442E48638">
the attorney for the Commonwealth to make u&s;e of CHARLES M'Manus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a witne&s;s; and as he had charged JOHN HAUER and PETER M'DONOGHY as being pre&s;ent, doing the murder, at the hou&s;e of FRANCIS SHITZ, whil&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> held their hor&s;es at the end of the lane&mdash;and that the other pri&s;oners were privy and con&s;enting to it, and had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in forming the plan;&mdash;a bill was prepared in which JOHN HAUER and PETER M'DONOGHY were charged as principals, and PATRICK DONAGAN, FRANCIS COX HUGH M'DONOUH and ELIZABETH HAUER as acce&s;&s;aries BEFORE the fact: which bill was found by the grand jury at March OYER and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 1798.</P>
<P>JOHN HAUER was fir&s;t put upon his trial, and after it had proceeded a con&s;iderable length, he expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;peak to the judges&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> whom he made a full confe&s;&s;ion of his own guilt, as an acce&s;&s;ary BEFORE the fact&mdash;but &s;trenuou&s;ly denied his being pre&s;ent at the hou&s;e the night of the murder&mdash;but that the murder was committed by CHARLES M'MANUS and PETER M'DONOGHY, and that the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners were acce&s;&s;aries BEFORE the fact. The next morning he per&s;i&s;ted in this confe&s;&s;ion in open court&mdash;whereupon the court, on motion of the coun&s;el for the common|wealth, di&s;charged the jury from giving any verdict, and remanded the pri|&s;oner, in order that a new indictment might be &s;ent up according to the truth of the fact, as it came out upon HAUER'S confe&s;&s;ion. The &s;tory of CHARLES M'MANUS being fal&s;ified in &s;ome very material parts, and it appearing mo&s;t probable, from the other te&s;timony, that he him&s;elf was the per&s;on who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> FRANCIS SHITZ, he was not examined as a witne&s;s on the trial of JOHN HAUER.</P>
<P>The entry or memorandum of this matter, as made by the pre&s;ident of the court, is taken from his notes, in the following words:</P>
<P>March 16th, 1798. Eight o'clock P.M. The court adjourned till to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock. The pri&s;oner had &s;ent for the pre&s;ident before the meeting of the court. La&s;t night at 9 o'clock, the pre&s;ident of the court, with judge Gloninger, went to the gaol, when the pri&s;oner made a full confe&s;&s;ion of his guilt as acce&s;&s;ary before the fact, but &s;trenuou&s;ly denied his being a princi|pal in the murder; which examination he &s;wore to upon oath and &s;ub&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="034040_0007_0FFA475848190F20">
March 17th. The court being met and the pri&s;oner at the bar, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to him by the pre&s;ident, in the hearing of every one, that the pri&s;oner had &s;ent for him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. Gloninger: That they received his confe&s;&s;ion as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;pected the murder of Francis Shitz, which he had &s;worn to and &s;igned.

<P>Mr. C. Smith moved that the jury be di&s;charged from the pri&s;oner, to give the commonwealth an opportunity to file a new bill again&s;t the parties now known to the court as principals and acce&s;&s;aries,&mdash;on the authority of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">8. 76. 327&mdash;8.</P>
<P>Thereupon the court di&s;charged the jury from giving any verdict on this indictment.</P>
<P>The coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner declined interfering, declaring that the pri&s;oner had taken him&s;elf out of their hands&mdash;that his confe&s;&s;ion was an act of his own, without con&s;ulting them&mdash;and they had nothing further to &s;ay at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The trials of all the other pri&s;oners were po&s;tponed, and the witne&s;&s;es recognized to the next court.</P>

<P>EVE DO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">BLER was the fir&s;t witne&s;s &s;worn on the part of the common|wealth.&mdash;She depo&s;ed as follows:</P>
<P>I was lying on a bench behind the &s;tove, I had ju&s;t awakened, and &s;aw a light in the kitchen,&mdash;I went out and there was a candle on the dre&s;&s;er&mdash;two men were &s;tanding by the fire near the dre&s;&s;er; they had their heads bound round with whiti&s;h handkerchiefs&mdash;they perceived me&mdash;and one of them, who had a whiti&s;h coat on, looked very angry at me, turned round, and followed me into the room. I took Francis Shitz by the arm, and told him there were &s;ome &s;trangers in the hou&s;e&mdash;he was lying on the bench behind the &s;tove a&s;leep. I thought he was ju&s;t getting up, when a pi&s;tol was fired off; the candle went out; &s;ome of the blood &s;pirted on my arm.

<P>I was alarmed, by my brother in law Michael Valentine, about midnight; he rapped at the door, and told me to get up as quick as I could, and to come down. I looked out of the window, and a boy hallowed to me that the Shitzes were murdered. I went down to the hou&s;e; I &s;aw Shitz covered with blood; I do not recollect how he lay; he was on the floor. It was on the night of the twenty eighth of December la&s;t&mdash;about twelve o'clock, or between twelve and one. There was a great quantity of blood, nearly as much as could be taken out of a good clever &s;teer; I was &s;urprized that a human creature could have &s;o much blood: He was lying in it. He appeared to moan very much, particularly when Mrs. Hauer, his &s;i&s;ter came. He kept con&s;tantly waving his right hand back and forward towards his head. When the pi&s;tol was found it was blown into, and the &s;mell of the fre&s;h powder came out; I was convinced it had been recently fired. He had four cuts on his head, and his &s;cull lay bare. We &s;earched for the place where he had been &s;hot, but could di&s;cover no marks of it&mdash;and we

I told him the man lived in the other county, [Mr. Carpenter is a ju&s;tice in Lanca&s;ter county, but he was certainly overcautious in this in&s;tance] and I can't do any thing in it.

<P>I was fitting at my work, one evening at Manheim, about two weeks before la&s;t Chri&s;tmas, in one Philip Bretz's &s;hop, working at my trade of &s;hoemaking. FRANCIS COX came to me, and told me he had &s;omething to &s;ay to me. I told him I had not time till I had fini&s;hed my pair of &s;hoes: That when I had done, I would go up to his hou&s;e in the evening, and he might tell me what it was then. When I quit my work, I did go up to his hou&s;e, but he was &s;ettling &s;ome law bu&s;ine&s;s about &s;ome partner&s;hip affair, which he and Michael Hogan had together, at Squire En&s;minger's. I went to En&s;minger's&mdash;I a&s;ked Cox what he wanted with me. He &s;aid he could not tell me till that affair was &s;ettled. I waited at En&s;minger's until the affair was over. Francis Cox and my employer then walked on a rod be|fore; Charles M'Manus and I walked together behind&mdash;we all went to Cox's hou&s;e together. On the road Charles M'Manus a&s;ked me to go to &s;ome town to &s;leep at a tavern on &s;uch a night; I don't recollect the name of the town&mdash;I think it was LEBANON, I am not &s;ure: Either the fir&s;t or &s;econd night after Chri&s;tmas, I think was what he &s;aid; and if I would &s;leep there he would give me as much money as would put me from hard work or &s;lavery. I a&s;ked him what it was he wanted with me. He told me he would not tell me till I would &s;wear an oath upon a book. I told him I would have no call to it, it BE TO BE &s;omething that was not right. He &s;aid it would not hurt me at all. I went home with my employer. Next day, or two days afterwards, Cox came to the &s;hop, where I was &s;itting at

<P>On the Thur&s;day evening before new-year, about half an hour before &s;un &s;et, Francis Cox and Charles M'Manus came to my hou&s;e; they had one creature along. Charles M'Manus a&s;ked me if I had any oats, I &s;hould give it to his mare. Cox &s;aid, no, I &s;hould give her hay fir&s;t. They a&s;ked for half a pint of whi&s;key; they a&s;ked to &s;tay all night, and wanted &s;up|per. They got their &s;upper. Then three Jer&s;ey men, who were travelling to Jer&s;ey, came, and wanted to &s;tay all night. About fifteen minutes before 8 o'clock, Cox and M'Manus a&s;ked to go to bed. I put them up &s;tairs in a room where two beds &s;tood. I told them they two mu&s;t &s;leep together. Cox made an&s;wer that they HAD SLEPT MANY A NIGHT TOGETHER. They ordered me to bring them half a pint of whi&s;key, and &s;ome water. When I took it up, they wanted me to take a gla&s;s of it; I told them I would not. Cox drank a gla&s;s, and a&s;ked Charles M'Manus if he wanted to drink a gla&s;s. He &s;aid, No, in the MORNING. When I came down, I ob&s;erved one of the Jer&s;ey men had boots on; &s;o I went back into the room where Cox and M'Manus lay, and fetched a pair of &s;lippers down. M'Manus a&s;ked me if them people wanted to go &s;oon to bed. I an&s;wered, yes. The Jer&s;ey men &s;oon after went to bed. I put two of them in the &s;ame room with Cox and M'Manus: the other Jer&s;ey man I put into a bed by him&s;elf. I then went to blacken the boots: while I was cleaning the boots, I heard my wife talking to M'Manus, out&s;ide of the door of the room, in the kitchen. She told him, I am &s;ure you need not come down, you have got a pot under your bed. He made an&s;wer, I want to go out.&mdash;He &s;taid a good while; he had no coat on when he went out. My wife got unea&s;y at his &s;taying &s;o long:&mdash;after a while I went out about the hou&s;e and barn, and looked every where, but could not find him. I then went and looked in the bed, and he was not there. I a&s;ked Cox where his comrade was: He an&s;wered that he complained of the BELLY-ACHE. We then hunted for him a &s;econd time, but could not find him. I went up to Francis Cox again, and told him to get up and help me to hunt his comrade. He an|&s;wered,
<PB N="16" REF="034040_0017_0FFA47920D88B8C0">
may be he went after the girls; and he would not get up. My wife then wanted me to get &s;ome of the neighbours to help to hunt for him. I went to one Abraham Meyers, about 50 rods down the road, but could not get him. I was afraid M'Manus had hanged him&s;elf. I then went to Martia Imhoffs; I could not get him&mdash;I went home again. My wife told me to rai&s;e up the travellers. I told her I was afraid, that I did not like to go to travellers' rooms by my&s;elf. At la&s;t I got one Brown, who lived in the hou&s;e, to go up with me, and I wakened the travellers. I told one of the two who lay in the room where Cox was, to lay &s;till, that I was afraid of Cox, he had refu&s;ed to get up to help to look for Charley. When Cox heard that, he got up out of his bed. I went with the candle to Cox's bed, and FOUND COX'S SHOES WERE GONE. I had M'Manus's boots locked up. I &s;aw that the whi&s;key was drank out. M'Manus's hat and coat lay on the table. COX TOOK THE SLIPPERS which I had given to Charley, AND PUT THEM ON HIS FEET. We hunted Charley up and down&mdash;round the barn, and in the barn, but could not find him. Cox looked a little, but not much. We then went back to the hou&s;e. We kept a candle burning all night. The Jer&s;ey people a&s;ked Cox, where that man (M'Manus) had his home. He an&s;wered, that he had his home no where. Francis Cox and Brown went to bed again. We had hunted for M'Manus about half an hour, or an hour. My wife &s;taid up a great while; I and the Jer&s;ey people &s;taid up all night. One of the Jer&s;ey people looked at his watch; it was then about 10 o'clock; and we thought M'Manus was dead by that time, as he did not come back. We waited awhile, and looked at the watch, and it was ONE o'clock&mdash;and again at 2 o'clock. M'Manus had not yet come back. A while after this, Francis Cox came down and &s;aid to me, M'MANUS is down there that we had been hunting for; that he threw &s;ome &s;tones upon the roof and wanted me to let him in. We did not hear them. He &s;aid he had come down to let him in. Cox then went to the door, opened it, and &s;aid, Damn your &s;oul, Charley, where have you been, to make us hunt you all night. M'Manus &s;aid nothing. We heard him going up &s;tairs with &s;hoes on, but he did not come into the room where we were. One of the Jer&s;ey men looked at his watch at this time, and it was three o'clock exactly. Next morning the Jer&s;ey people a&s;ked him where he was; he made an&s;wer, that he was ALONG WITH A WOMAN: that he had made a bargain with a woman out of Lebanon, and &s;he would not come to my hou&s;e, for
<PB N="17" REF="034040_0018_0FFA479A6A225C98">
fear we &s;hould know her, and &s;he made a bargain to meet him at my barn; that he met her there, and they then went to old Imhoff's barn together. The Jer&s;ey men plagued him a good deal about it. He then called for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">int of whi&s;key, and wanted breakfa&s;t. I told him I could not give them break|fa&s;t, as my wife had gone to bed &s;ick; but I would give them &s;ome cold victuals. He a&s;ked to &s;ee my wife; I went in with him to the room; he offered her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> if &s;he would &s;tand on her feet. He went in a &s;econd time, and told her not to take it &s;o hard; that for the price of his little mare in the &s;table he would not that it had happened &s;o; that next Sunday he would give her a pre&s;ent that was worth &pound;.10&mdash;that he had ENOUGH, and could do it without hurting him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It was a VERY COLD night. It was the &s;ame night the murder was com|mitted. It is about five or &s;ix miles from my hou&s;e to where Shitz lived.</P>
<P>Cox rode the mare away the next morning; &s;hortly after M'Manus fol|lowed him on foot.</P>

<P>MARY GEIGER, the wife of Jacob Geiger, was next affirmed as a witne&s;s.</P>
<P>She related the circum&s;tances in the &s;ame manner as her hu&s;band, It is therefore unnece&s;&s;ary to repeat them, unle&s;s where &s;he was &s;omewhat more minute and particular. She &s;aid:&mdash;</P>
<P>That after all the &s;trangers had gone to bed, &s;he had locked the front door, and had gone into her own room to make her bed, and bolted the door with a bolt in&s;ide, that it had no other fa&s;tening. That &s;oon after &s;he heard a rattling at the outer door; &s;he unbolted her own door, and &s;aw M'Manus &s;tanding in the kitchen, at the outer door, with a handkerchief tied round his head, which had a whiti&s;h appearance&mdash;(to u&s;e her own words.) I am &s;ure, &s;ays I, you frightened me. He gave a laugh. Sure, &s;ays I, you need not have come down, you have got a pot under your bed. He &s;aid he wanted to go out; I then unlocked the door. I looked after him, and &s;aw a little red &s;hining thro' the handkerchief which was tied round his head. He had come to our hou&s;e before, and pretended that he wanted to buy cattle. We hunted him about an hour, Cox helped to hunt, but did not go as the re&s;t did, and did not SEEM MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT IT.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="034040_0019_0FFA479C099BA010">
We kept a lamp burning all night. One can &s;ee from the out&s;ide, when there is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the hou&s;e; the people were all &s;itting in the place where the light was, and any one might &s;ee them thro' the window, from the road.</P>
<P>When M'Manus went out he had nothing on but his &s;hirt, a jacket without &s;leeves, and his trou&s;ers. He had NO SHOES ON, and I believe no &s;tockings. It was very cold that night. He had no bundle in his hand carrying.</P>
<P>When Cox came down to let M'Manus in, he came down very &s;oftly without either SHOES OR SLIPPERS on; I did not hear him till he came to the door&mdash;We could then &s;ee that he had no &s;hoes or &s;lippers on. He then let M'Manus in, and they went up &s;tairs together, and we heard M'Manus GOING UP STAIRS WITH SHOES ON, but we did not &s;ee him, as they did not come into the place where we were.</P>
<P>M'Manus told me the next morning that he could give me a pre&s;ent of &pound;.10 and not hurt him&s;elf, for HE HAD ENOUGH. He &s;aid he had been along with a girl.</P>
<P>CHARLES M'MANUS'S confe&s;&s;ions and examinations, being four in num|ber, were then read; but they were lengthy and contradictory: in one of them he had given as a rea&s;on for his leaving Geiger's hou&s;e, that he had taken ill with a complaint in his bowels, but did not adhere to the &s;tory of the girl. In his other confe&s;&s;ions he declared that John Hauer and Peter M'Donough were the per&s;ons in the hou&s;e and actually pre&s;ent at the killing; that he him&s;elf held their hor&s;es at the end of Hauer's lane, which was admitted to be three quarters of a mile, at lea&s;t, from the &s;cene of action&mdash;and &s;trongly denied his having any other hand in it. That Patrick Donagan was the per&s;on who procured him to have any concern in it; and that they were to have &pound;.1100 for the job. That he once threatened to tell, and actually did inform Squire Carpenter, and a man at Manheim, one Evans, that the murder was to be committed. That he had met Hauer and M'Donough at the Black Hor&s;e tavern, the Sunday before the murder was committed, and the Thur&s;day night following (28th) was agreed upon for its execution. That M'Donough wanted Cox to go with him, but Cox threatened to tell, and he was then to get &pound;2 or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">00 for concealing it.</P>

night of the murder. But putting it upon the gentlemen's own ground, it would make no difference as to the re&s;ult, but the pri&s;oner mu&s;t be convicted even upon his own confe&s;&s;ions; for it is not nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be the very per&s;on who fired the pi&s;tol, or &s;truck the &s;troke, nor even that he &s;hould be an eye or an ear-witne&s;s; if in any other way he was aiding the general de&s;ign, though at a di&s;tance off, it is a &s;ufficient pre&s;ence, to make him a prin|cipal.

<P><Q>Several per&s;ons &s;et out together, or in &s;mall parties, upon one common de&s;ign, be it murder o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> other felony, or for any other purpo&s;e unlawful in it&s;elf, and each taketh the part a&s;&s;igned him; &s;ome to commit the fact, others to watch <HI>at proper di&s;tances and &s;tations</HI> to prevent a &s;urprize, or to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avor,</HI> if need be, the <HI>e&s;cape</HI> of tho&s;e who are more immediately en|gaged. They are all, provided the fact be committed, in the eye of the law, pre&s;ent at it. For it was made a common cau&s;e with them, each man operated in his &s;tation at one and the &s;ame in&s;tant towards the &s;ame common end; and the part each man took tended to give countenance, encouragement and protection to the whole gang, and to en&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;s of their common enterprize.</Q> And again, in pa. 351. &s;. 6. it is further &s;aid, that <Q>in combinations of this kind the mortal &s;troke, tho' given by one of the party, is con&s;idered in the eye of the law, and of &s;ound rea&s;on too, as given by every individual pre&s;ent and abetting. The per&s;on actually giving the &s;troke is no more than the hand or in&s;trument by which the others &s;trike.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And therefore where the indictment chargeth, that A. gave the mortal &s;troke, and that B. and C. were pre&s;ent aiding and abetting; if it cometh out in evidence that B. was the per&s;on who gave the &s;troke, and that A. and C. were pre&s;ent aiding and abetting, they may be all found guilty of murder or man&s;laughter at common law, as circum&s;tances may vary the ca&s;e. The identity of the per&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed to have given the &s;troke is but a circum&s;tance, and, in this ca&s;e, a very immaterial one; the &s;troke of <HI>one</HI> is in con&s;ideration of law the &s;troke of all.</Q> So that in which ever point

of view the evidence may be con&s;idered by the jury, they mu&s;t convict the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The Court expre&s;&s;ed their opinion very deci&s;ively that it could not po&s;&s;i|bly make any difference; and that if the fact was even believed by the jury, that M'Manus was not in the hou&s;e, but at the end of the lane, with the hor&s;es, ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the perpetrators of the deed in their e&s;cape or flight, he was equally guilty with them, and ought to be convicted on this indict|ment; the fact of the killing being &s;tated in the indictment, to be done by M'Manus, being a mere circum&s;tance, and no ways material.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner therefore declined &s;aying more; and the mat|ter appearing &s;o plain, the Coun&s;el for the Commonwealth did not addre&s;s the jury.</P>
<P>THE PRESIDENT in his charge went into a particular detail of the evi|dence: He told the jury that if one circum&s;tance had turned up favorable to the pri&s;oner, he &s;hould have thought him&s;elf bound to have given it its full force; but that no favorable circum&s;tance had occurred which could induce them to he&s;itate a moment re&s;pecting the guilt of the pri&s;oner. He al&s;o told the jury, that by a late act of a&s;&s;embly, they mu&s;t a&s;certain in their verdict, if they found the pri&s;oner guilty, whether he was guilty of murder in the fir&s;t or &s;econd degree. That from the circum&s;tances in this ca&s;e it was unque&s;|tionably murder in the fir&s;t degree.</P>

<P>The coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner feel con&s;iderable difficulty as to the mode of bringing forward an application to the court on his behalf; they therefore claim the indulgence of the court. They are &s;atisfied the court will be &s;o far of coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner as not to &s;uffer him ha&s;tily to be &s;urprized into a plea, which may operate to his injury. JOHN HAUER was indicted at the la&s;t court as a principal. He was then arraigned, pleaded&mdash;a jury &s;worn, te&s;timony given, and afterwards that jury di&s;charged with|out giving a verdict. We contend that after &s;uch di&s;charge, he can never again be put upon his trial for the &s;ame offence. This new indictment is, in fact, for the &s;ame offence. The offence of a principal and of an acce&s;&s;ary <HI>before</HI> the fact, are &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame; and if one is acquitted as principal, he can not be indicted again as acce&s;&s;ary <HI>before</HI> the fact.

This doctrine is, upon con&s;ideration of the books, agreed to be the law. It is true, this ca&s;e goes farther, and upon a doubt being &s;ug|ge&s;ted whether, if the pri&s;oner &s;hould be acquitted as principal, he could be afterwards indicted as acce&s;&s;ary BEFORE the fact; to avoid this doubt, the court di&s;charged the jury of him, and ordered another indictment to be again&s;t him as acce&s;&s;ary. We are, however prepared to &s;how that this latter point is not the law, but that it has been long &s;ince exploded. This ca&s;e mu&s;t certainly be determined upon principle and precedent, and not on the chamber opinions and &s;peculative rea&s;oning of any judge, however re|putable and learned. The gentlemen mean to rely greatly upon <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI>&mdash;yet even Judge Fo&s;ter lays it down, that one acquitted as principal cannot be indicted as acce&s;&s;ary BEFORE; he &s;peaks of it as a &s;ettled point; and although he finds fault with the principle, and throws out his doubts for the opinion of the learned, yet this cannot control what is admitted to be the law of the land. So in <HI>Hawkins</HI> chap. 35.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. 11. this is &s;aid to be holden to be the law in many books of good authority: Sir <HI>Wm.

It &s;tands uncontroled by any judicial deci&s;ion. Then, if the pri&s;oner be indicted for an offence of which an acquittal on the former indictment might have been pleaded in bar; we contend that the di&s;charge of the jury upon the trial has the &s;ame operation. This is the &s;ame offence for which JOHN HAUER was indicted at the la&s;t court, and he cannot be twice put in JEOPARDY for it. We will &s;how that the court have not the power to di&s;charge the jury, after the evidence, for any thing that appears on the record, was all gone through on the part of the commonwealth. If the contrary doctrine could be &s;upported, then the life of a pri&s;oner might be put in JEOPARDY as often as the pro&s;ecutor might think fit, either for the purpo&s;es of oppre&s;&s;ion, or becau&s;e he might not have evidence &s;ufficient to convict. Even in a civil action a jury cannot be di&s;charged without con&s;ent, whatever may be the ju&s;tice of the ca&s;e. Shall

we be le&s;s tenacious of the principle where the life of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is at &s;take?

So, from motives of humanity to the pri&s;oner, as where a woman was &s;uddenly taken in labor in the cour&s;e of the trial. But the general doctrine is fixed, that a jury once charged in a capital ca&s;e cannot be di&s;charged without giving a verdict.</P>
<P>The authorities upon which we rely are numerous and &s;trong. In 1. In&s;t. 227.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> LORD CO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">E &s;ays, that a jury &s;worn and charged in ca&s;e of life or member, cannot be di&s;charged by the court or any other, but they ought to give a verdict.

<P N="1">1. That in capital ca&s;es a <HI>juror cannot be withdrawn,</HI> tho' all parties con&s;ent to it.</P>
<P N="2">2. That in criminal ca&s;es, not capital, a juror may be withdrawn, if both parties con&s;ent, but not otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. And that in all civil cau&s;es, a juror cannot be withdrawn, but by con&s;ent of all parties.</P>
<P>And in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Stra. 984. in the ca&s;e of the King and Jeffs, who was indicted for Barratry;&mdash;the pro&s;ecutor could not go on for want of a copy of &s;everal proce&s;&s;es, after he had given &s;ome &s;trong proof. Whereupon it was in&s;i&s;ted to withdraw a juror, as it was done la&s;t term on an indictment again&s;t the &s;cavengers of St. Giles', for not paying money according to a ju&s;tice's order; and there being &s;ome unpreparedne&s;s, Mr. Abney, one of the king's coun&s;el, con&s;ented to withdraw a juror.</P>
<P>The Chief Ju&s;tice at fir&s;t inclined to it, but upon con&s;ideration held, there was a difference between that ca&s;e, which may be compared to ca&s;es of a civil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and this, where the puni&s;hment may be infamous, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>Among the fir&s;t ca&s;es which appear in the books, where the court un|dertook to di&s;charge the jury, is the remarkable ca&s;e of <HI>Whitebread &amp; Fen|wick,</HI> 31. Car. 2. 1679. They were indicted for high trea&s;on together with three other Je&s;uits, and upon being arraigned, they objected that they had already been tried for the &s;ame facts, a jury charged with them, and the evi|dence found in&s;ufficient, and then the jury di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without giving a verdict; and they apprehended they could not be put in JEOPARDY of their lives a &s;econd time for the &s;ame cau&s;e; that they ought, at the former trial, either to have been condemned or acquitted&mdash;This was certainly an objection of great weight: for every pri&s;oner with whom a jury is charged in capital ca&s;es, ought either to be acquitted or convicted at that time&mdash;el&s;e, in&s;tead of one trial, a man may be made to undergo twenty trials for the &s;ame fact, when the court find the evidence again&s;t him defective. The court, however, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">wered, that it was in their di&s;cretion, to di&s;charge the jury without tak|ing a verdict, where witne&s;&s;es were wanting, or where there was any ac|cident of the like nature. It is to be hoped that the Coun&s;el for the Com|monwealth would not wi&s;h to rely upon a ca&s;e &s;trongly marked with op|pre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice. Yet upon this ca&s;e, and &s;ome others, in the fame ar|bitrary and corrupt reign, even Lord Hale, great and good as he was, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to have grounded his opinion of the law, that the court may, under the circum&s;tances he mentions in his 2d vol. 295-6, di&s;charge the jury of the pri&s;oner, and remit him to gaol for further evidence; and that it had been &s;o practiced in mo&s;t circuits of England. The learned editor of this valuable work, does not, however, &s;eem to concur in opinion with the text; for, in a note upon this very point, he combats the doctrine with much force, and mentions, that it hath been &s;ince holden for law, that a jury once charged in a capital ca&s;e, cannot be di&s;charged till they have given their verdict, and the ca&s;e of Whitebread was thought a very extraordinary one: and Mr. Fo&s;ter, in his report, pa. 30. hopes that it never will be a que&s;tion again, whether in a capital ca&s;e, the court may, in their di&s;cretion, di&s;charge a jury after evidence given and concluded on the part of the Crown, merely for want of &s;ufficient evidence to convict; and in order to bring the pri&s;oner to a &s;econd trial, when the Crown may be better prepared:&mdash;That this was
<PB N="27" REF="034040_0028_0FFA47CC66F08950">
done in the ca&s;e of Whitebread and Fenwick, and it was certainly a mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable proceeding. I hope, he adds, it will never be drawn into exam|ple. This ca&s;e, therefore, by the concurring &s;entiments of all modern Lawyers, appears to be entirely exploded. How is the ca&s;e of JOHN HAUER to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the ca&s;e of Whitebread and Fenwick? He was indicted before, for an offence &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame as the pre&s;ent&mdash;the &s;ame murder; he pleaded not guilty; a jury was &s;worn and charged with him; the whole of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, for any thing that appears upon the record, gone through on the part of the Commonwealth; and then, for want of &s;ufficient evidence to convict, the jury was di&s;charged without his con&s;ent or concurrence, or without any rea&s;ons for it appearing upon the record; and he is now brought a &s;econd time to trial, upon a new indictment, for the &s;ame crime. If this is legal, we &s;hall again &s;et up the ca&s;e of Whitebread and Fenwick, and the mo&s;t unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive con&s;equences mu&s;t follow from the doctrine. Shortly after the ca&s;e of Whitebread and Fenwick, we find the Judges di&s;&s;enting from the doctrine; and in the ca&s;e of the Lord Delamere, who was tried for high trea&s;on, 1. Jac. 2. 4. State trial, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. upon a que&s;tion put to them by the Lord High Steward, they unanimou&s;ly declared, that <HI>where the trial is by a jury, there the law is clear, the jury once charged, can never be di&s;charged, till they have given their verdict, this is clear.</HI> So in Ambro&s;e Rookwoods ca&s;e. 8 Wm. 3.

He
<PB N="28" REF="034040_0029_0FFA47D275B874E8">
tells us, 4 Black. 360. that, when the evidence on both &s;ides is clo&s;ed, and indeed when any evidence is given, the jury cannot be di&s;charged (unle&s;s in ca&s;es of EVIDENT nece&s;&s;ity,) till they have given in their verdict. What, then are the&s;e ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity? For if the pre&s;ent falls within any of the excepted ca&s;es in the books, we are content that the pri&s;oner &s;hould un|dergo another trial. But if it does not, we hope that in Penn&s;ylvania there can be no difficulty how the Court will decide. And altho' the pri&s;oner &s;hould be loaded with crimes&mdash;altho' we &s;hould look upon him with the utmo&s;t abhorrence; yet, it is the law of the land that is to be dealt out to him; and if by that law he is, under the circum&s;tances which have happened, intitled to his di&s;charge, the court cannot he&s;itate to di&s;charge him. The ca&s;e of the two Kinlocks re&s;ts upon ground peculiar to it&s;elf&mdash;and affords no authority in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Judge Fo&s;ter, in giving his opinion, con&s;i|dered that ca&s;e &s;ingly as it &s;tood upon the record, and threw out every con&s;i|deration that was foreign to it. Let us then con&s;ider the pre&s;ent ca&s;e as it appears upon the record. Not a &s;ingle rea&s;on for the di&s;charge of the jury appears upon this record; but as it &s;tands, it mu&s;t be taken for granted, that the whole evidence was concluded on the part of the Commonwealth: and that there not being &s;ufficient to convict the pri&s;oner, the Court di&s;charg|ed the jury of him, in order to bring him to a &s;econd trial when the Com|monwealth might be better prepared. Nothing appears to the contrary of this. The record cannot now be altered; we cannot have recour&s;e to our memory as to what pa&s;&s;ed. The entry is only "<HI>that, on motion of the Coun&s;el for the Commonwealth, the Court di&s;charged the jury from giving any verdict.</HI> There was no con&s;ent as concurrence of the pri&s;oner; nor does any motive appear for the proceeding. This then is exactly the ca&s;e of Whitebread and Fenwick which has been &s;o ju&s;tly exploded. We may ob&s;erve how cautious they were in the ca&s;e of the Kinlocks to put every thing upon the record; and the nine judges who determined it, did it upon the peculiar cir|cum&s;tances of the ca&s;e. The only que&s;tion there was, <Q>Whether in a capi|tal ca&s;e, where the pri&s;oner may make his full defence by coun&s;el, the Court may not di&s;charge the jury upon the motion of the pri&s;oner's coun|&s;el, and at his own reque&s;t, and with the con&s;ent of the Attorney-General, BEFORE EVIDENCE given, in order to let the pri&s;oner into a defence, which, in the opinion of the Court, he could not otherwi&s;e have been let into</Q>&mdash;and all this was regularly entered, and <HI>appeared upon the record.</HI>

It was out of humanity to the pri&s;oner, and by his own <HI>expre&s;s con&s;ent, and before any evidence was given</HI> on the part of the Crown. It was not the que&s;tion, whether a jury may be di&s;charged after evidence given, in order to the preferring a new indictment better &s;uited to the nature of the ca&s;e; where through the ignorance or collu&s;ion of the officer, or the mi&s;take of the pro|&s;ecutor, the fact laid varieth from the real fact, or cometh &s;hort of it in point of guilt. Nor&mdash;whether in a capital ca&s;e, the court may, in their di&s;cre|tion, di&s;charge a jury after evidence given and concluded on the part of the Crown, merely for want of &s;ufficient evidence to convict, as was done in the ca&s;e of Whitebread and Fenwick: but the Court cautiou&s;ly confined them&s;elves to the peculiar circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e then before them, and left every other point undecided. This ca&s;e, therefore, not being the ca&s;e before the court, is there any other ca&s;e which will help out the Common|wealth? For we hope we &s;hall not go beyond decided ca&s;es. Let them &s;how us, if they can, any other ca&s;e, be&s;ides Whitebread and Fenwick's ca&s;e, where the Court did di&s;charge the jury without the pri&s;oner's con&s;ent, or without an irre&s;i&s;tible nece&s;&s;ity. The ca&s;e of Elizabeth Meadow, Fo&s;t. 76. was a ca&s;e of extreme nece&s;&s;ity, and the principles of humanity could not permit the trial to proceed. Fo&s;t. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">27-8. is not a decided ca&s;e; it is the &s;ingle extra-judicial opinion of a &s;peculative writer, and ought not to have any influence in deciding this point again&s;t the authorities oppo&s;ed to it.

The Judge <HI>doubting</HI> whether he could &s;wear another jury, di&s;charged the eleven, and left the pri&s;oner in goal. The Court was moved for a writ of HABEAS CORPUS to bring up the pri&s;oner that he might be di&s;charged, <HI>having been once</HI> put upon his trial. This being a new ca&s;e, the Court &s;aid they would advi&s;e with the other Judges upon it; and afterwards they all agreed, that the pri&s;oner might be tried at the next a&s;&s;izes, or the Judge might have ordered a new jury to have been &s;worn immediately.</Q> This ca&s;e happened as low down

<P>But whatever the law of England may have been; however it may have varied from time to time, according to the caprice of Judges, under the influence of the Crown, in an arbitrary and corrupt reign; and again fluctuated when the Judges have been more virtuous, and more regardful of the law of the land. The framers of the Con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania &s;eem to have intended to put this matter at re&s;t. In the 9th article of that Con&s;titution, "that the general, great, and e&s;&s;ential principles of liberty and free government may be recognized and unalterably e&s;tabli&s;hed, they declare," &amp;c. and in the 10th &s;ection of this article, one of tho&s;e <HI>unalterable</HI> principles they declare to be, that&mdash;"no per&s;on &s;hall, for the &s;ame offence, be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb." When the Con&s;titution of the United States was adopted, it was made an exception by &s;ome of the &s;tates, that this e&s;&s;ential principle was not carried into it; it was deemed a nece&s;&s;ary barrier again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion from the government, and to defend the liberty of the citizen. Accordingly it was afterwards declared, and made part of the Con&s;titution, by the 7th article of the amendments, that "no per&s;on &s;hould be &s;ubject, for the &s;ame offence, to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb."&mdash;This, then, as well as the Con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania, is the SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND. The Con&s;titution of England is not a written one&mdash;They may modify, they may &s;hape it, from time to time, as they may think will be&s;t an&s;wer the ends of public ju&s;tice, or of party. But here the Con&s;titution cannot be altered or modified. The courts are bound by it: They cannot &s;tep over it: They have it not in their power to violate a &s;ingle article of it. It limits the very powers, not of the Judges only, but of the Legi&s;lature it&s;elf.&mdash;The court cannot &s;ay, as they may heretofore have &s;aid in England, the Commonwealth has not been ready; there is not &s;ufficient evidence to convict; we will di&s;charge the jury, and bring the pri&s;oner to trial again, when the commonwealth is better prepared.

To conclude. The offences are &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame. An acquittal of the pri&s;oner as principal would operate to di&s;charge him as acce&s;&s;ary <HI>before</HI> the fact.

<SPEAKER>FOR THE COMMONWEALTH. C. HALL &amp; C. SMITH</SPEAKER>
<P>If the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner have really con&s;idered this que&s;tion as of moment, and that the re&s;ult may prove advantageous to their client, we feel happy that they have had a patient hearing. They may conceive that the life of JOHN HAUER depends upon the deci&s;ion of this point; and un|der this impre&s;&s;ion, they may deem it an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to urge it, on his behalf, with all the force of their ingenuity. Should they fail, they will at lea&s;t feel a &s;atisfaction in having left nothing undone, which po&s;&s;ibly might, in the event, prove beneficial to the pri&s;oner at the bar.</P>
<P>It is true this motion is &s;ingular in its form. In the out&s;et, without any plea in bar, by which they would be bound to &s;how the record of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uterfoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s acquit,</HI> it is a new mode to &s;top the progre&s;s of the trial. They &s;hould at lea&s;t, we &s;uppo&s;e, bring the facts before the Court, by &s;ome plea, before they would be intitled to be heard. If however, the Court are &s;atisfied, we have no objection to follow the gentlemen in this way, expecting it will &s;ave the trouble of going over the &s;ame ground in another form.</P>
<P>JOHN HAUER was indicted at the la&s;t Court, as a principal in the murder of FRANCIS SHITZ; a jury was &s;worn and charged with him; a part of the evidence was given; but the pri&s;oner thought proper to make a full confe&s;&s;ion to two of the Judges, criminating him&s;elf as an ACCESSARY BEFORE the fact, and &s;trenuou&s;ly denying his being the principal murderer. It was in con&s;equence of his OWN ACT, therefore, that the jury were di&s;charg|ed, on motion of the coun&s;el for the Commonwealth, in order that a new indictment might be found, better &s;uited to the truth of the fact. It would
<PB N="32" REF="034040_0033_0FFA47E8A59E62E8">
have been improper to have proceeded in the trial to give the pri&s;oner; manife&s;tly guilty by his own confe&s;&s;ion, a chance of e&s;caping. It would have been injurious to the public ju&s;tice of the country. A new indictment has been accordingly found; and the pri&s;oner's coun&s;el now contend, that he ought not to be put to plead; that the former jury ought not to have been di&s;charged of him without giving a verdict; and that no man can be twice put in JEOPARDY for the &s;ame offence. We on the other hand, hope to &s;atisfy the Court, that what has been done, has been done rightly; that it would be a di&s;grace to the law, if under the peculiar circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e, the Court had not, for the purpo&s;es of public ju&s;tice, the power they have exerci&s;ed. We hope that at this day it cannot be made a que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Before we proceed, we beg leave to ob&s;erve upon the concluding part of the lengthy argument we have ju&s;t heard. It has been endeavored, from what motives we know not, to treat this as a con&s;titutional que&s;tion, as if we did not regard the rights of our fellow citizens equally with the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner. In fact, the Con&s;titution has nothing to do with the matter before the Court. It is the con&s;truction of the principle the gentlemen rely upon, that is to be looked to. The very principle it&s;elf was not fir&s;t known in this country; we borrowed it from the Engli&s;h law; we inherited it as our birth right from a country where civil liberty is as highly regarded as in any country upon earth. That NO MAN SHALL BE TWICE PUT IN JEO|PARDY OF LIFE OR LIMB, for the &s;ame offence, is as old as the Engli&s;h law, and was well calculated to protect the &s;ubject from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the crown. It is, as it were, the MAGNA CHARTA of the criminal law. We mu&s;t therefore under&s;tand the meaning of rules and terms, before we under|take to argue from them; and the con&s;truction given to this rule in the country from which we derived it, and where it has always been well un|der&s;tood, mu&s;t guide us upon this occa&s;ion; and we hope to &s;atisfy the Court that it does not &s;tand in our way.</P>
<P>We will readily agree that a jury ought not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o be di&s;charged without the pri&s;oner's con&s;ent, merely becau&s;e there is not &s;ufficient evidence to convict him upon that indictment, and in order to procure more full proof at a &s;ub&s;equent trial, as was done in the ca&s;e of Whitebread and Fenwick, which we hope, with Judge Fo&s;ter and the Coun&s;el for JOHN HAUER, may never
<PB N="33" REF="034040_0034_0FFA15F041FCA2F0">
again be drawn into example. But that the Court under no circum&s;tance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; even where the purpo&s;es of public ju&s;tice require it, and where without the exerci&s;e of &s;uch a di&s;cretion, the mo&s;t atrocious offender mu&s;t e&s;cape, to the di&s;grace of the law, have &s;uch a power, is what we cannot accede to. For where, either through the ignorance or inattention, or by the mi&s;take of the pri&s;oner, a bill is &s;ent up, charging one grade of crime, and it turns out up|on the evidence that the pri&s;oner is guilty of another grade of the &s;ame crime; there is no ca&s;e which &s;ays the jury &s;hall not be di&s;charged, that a new bill may be &s;ent up adapted to the facts and circum&s;tances attending the com|mi&s;&s;ion of the crime. If the Court have the power at all, they mu&s;t judge of the occa&s;ion when to exerci&s;e it. It cannot be confined to one ca&s;e in par|ticular, but mu&s;t depend upon the nece&s;&s;ity which at any time may require it.&mdash;But the circum&s;tances being as they are in this ca&s;e, how &s;tand the au|thorities? An attentive con&s;ideration of them may throw clear light upon this &s;ubject. It is true, and the rule ought never to be violated, that where a man is once fairly ACQUITIED upon any indictment, he may PLEAD &s;uch acquittal in bar of any &s;ub&s;equent accu&s;ation for the SAME CRIME. This plea, &s;ays Judge Black&s;tone, 4 Black. 335, is grounded on this univer&s;al maxim of the common law of England, that no man is to be brought into jeopardy of his life, more than once, for the &s;ame offence. But then he mu&s;t be found NOT GUILTY on an indictment FREE FROM ERROR, and WELL COMMENC|ED before a Court which has juri&s;diction of the cau&s;e. 2 Hawk. chap. 35 &s;ect. 1. For if his life was never in JEOPARDY&mdash;as where he is acquitted upon an ILL indictment, upon which he could not have been convicted, or if convicted could not have been puni&s;hed, the plea of <HI>auterfoits acquit, or convict,</HI> is no bar to another indictment. The&s;e ca&s;es &s;how the force and extent of the principle the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner &s;o &s;trongly rely upon, and how it ought to be applied; and to apply it in any other way, would be to render it as a &s;anctuary for enormous offenders, and not a protection from oppre&s;&s;ion. 2 Hawk. chap. 35. &s;ect. 3&mdash;8.&mdash;2 Hale, 247&mdash;8.&mdash;Fo&s;t. 26.

But if he had even been acquitted upon that indictment, it would not have availed him; becau&s;e the indictment is materially defective; and if he had been convicted, he never could have been puni&s;hed upon it. It is not &s;tated that Francis Shitz, died of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> received.

Now, however ab&s;urd this objection may appear to the grammarian, yet if the law requires this technical pre|ci&s;ion, there is an end of the pre&s;ent que&s;tion; this objection alone is deci&s;ive&mdash;all the precedents warrant this objection;&mdash;and &s;o is 2 Hale, 247-8. Vaux's ca&s;e expre&s;&s;ly decided in 4 Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 44-5. and in 2 Hawk. chap. 25. &s;ect. 60, it is &s;aid, that no indictment of death can be good without an expre&s;s allegation, that the decea&s;ed both received the hurt which is laid as the cau&s;e of his death, and al&s;o that he DIED of the hurt &s;o received; and the want thereof cannot be made good, by any implication what&s;oever.

It is therefore evident, from the&s;e authori|ties, that the fir&s;t indictment was &s;o materially defective, that if the pri&s;oner had been convicted, he never could have been executed upon it. The Court mu&s;t, upon motion have <HI>qua&s;hed</HI> it, and the Attorney General has entered a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pro&s;equi</HI> upon it before he &s;ent this &s;econd indictment to the grand jury.</P>
<P>But let us con&s;ider the two points made by the pri&s;oner's coun&s;el, in the order they have made them, and whether either of them can be of avail.&mdash;</P>
<P>Lord Hale does indeed lay it down as the law, that one indicted as principal and acquitted, &s;hall not be indicted as acce&s;&s;ary BEFORE, and if he be, he may plead his former acquittal in bar, for it is in &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame offence&mdash;but the antient law was otherwi&s;e. 1. Hale 626. and this &s;eems to be admitted in Kel. 26. But notwith&s;tanding this weighty authority, it may rea&s;onably be doubted whether it is &s;ound law, or can be &s;upported upon principle. It certainly is not an uncontroverted point, but remains &s;till open for judicial deci&s;ion, whenever the ca&s;e &s;hall be fairly brought before the Court. And when the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner re&s;t upon Hawkins, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="36" REF="034040_0037_0FFA47FE6696D090">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Black&s;tone as confirming this doctrine, they re&s;t upon an un&s;olid foun|dation; for as far as the doubts of the&s;e great and truly learned men can do it, they have weakened the authority of Lord Hale. Even the authorities cited by Lord Hale from the year book of Edw. 3. and Fitzherbert's abridge|ment&mdash;Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">one 150 &amp; 282. do not warrant the doctrine in its full extent. Hawkins &s;ays only that it is HOLDEN in many books of good authority, (CONTRARY TO <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">HAT IS ADMITTED TO HAVE BEEN THE ANTIENT LAW) that the acquittal of a man as principal, is a good bar of a &s;ub&s;equent pro|&s;ecution again&s;t him as acce&s;&s;ary BEFORE; for it is &s;aid that &s;uch an acce&s;|&s;ary is in &s;ome mea&s;ure guilty of the fact, and therefore that an acquittal, which clears a man from being guilty of the fact, doth by con&s;equence clear him from being &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ary. And this &s;eems rea&s;onable UPON THE SUPPOSITION that a man may be found guilty of an indictment again&s;t him as principal, upon evidence which only proves him to have been an acce&s;&s;ary BEFORE. But if a man cannot be found guilty of &s;uch an indictment upon &s;uch evidence, as it is &s;trongly holden that he cannot, it may WITH GREAT REASON be &s;aid, that the acquittal of him as principal, no way acquits him as acce&s;&s;ary BEFORE; for if &s;o, he might &s;ave him&s;elf by a mere &s;lip in the in|dictment, and bar all other pro&s;ecutions by an acquittal on a trial, which in truth never brought him into danger of his life. And it is upon this &s;uppo&s;i|tion, as I &s;uppo&s;e, that it is holden in &s;ome books, contrary to tho&s;e above cited, that one who has been acquitted as principal, may be tried again as acce&s;&s;ary BEFORE, as well as AFTER 2 Hawk. chap. 35. &s;ect. 11.&mdash;Now it is well known, that, in detailing the different opinions upon any &s;ubject, Serjeant Hawkins always gave his own in the la&s;t place; and he appears evidently oppo&s;ed to the principle &s;et up by Lord Hale and others. The many books of good authority which he refers to, are Kelyng. 25-6. 1. Hale, 626. 2 Hale, 244. Grompton's Ju&s;tice, 42. 112. 2. Edw. 3.20. Fitzh. Corone, 150. In &s;upport of his own opinion, he refers to Keilway, 107. Dali&s;on, 14. It is certainly true that the pri&s;oner could not have been convicted as a principal upon evidence which proved him only an acce&s;&s;ary BEFORE the fact. If we are right in this, then how ab&s;urd it would be to &s;ay that an acquittal upon one indictment &s;hall be a bar to another in|dictment, where the evidence on each of them mu&s;t be &s;pecifically different; where the &s;ame facts cannot apply to both; and what would be &s;ufficient to convict upon the one, could not apply, or &s;erve to convict upon the others.

If the evidence in both ca&s;es was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame, then there might be &s;ome rea&s;on for the law; but as it is, altho' in point of crime and puni&s;hment, the offen|ces are equal; yet as the circum&s;tances are different, tho' tending to the &s;ame mi&s;chief, the law gives to them a different con&s;ideration. But if they are to be con&s;idered as the SAME offence, and an acquittal of a man as principal, will bar an indictment again&s;t him as acce&s;&s;ary BEFORE; how &s;till more ab|&s;urd it is that the principle &s;hould not hold throughout. Yet we find it AGREED, 2 Hawk. 16. &s;ect. 12. that an acquittal of a man as acce&s;&s;ary BE|FORE, is no bar to a &s;ub&s;equent pro&s;ecution again&s;t him as PRINCIPAL. Is it po&s;&s;ible to reconcile the incon&s;i&s;tency?&mdash;It appears, however, by no means to be a &s;ettled point; nor has the practice been uniform; for in a State trials, 798. Samuel Atkins was tried on two &s;everal indictments; fir&s;t, as principal, and next as acce&s;&s;ary in the murder of Sir Edmondbury God|frey. Sir Michael Fo&s;ter, who&s;e opinions upon the &s;ubject of the Crown law, are entitled to great weight, con&s;iders this point in pa. 361. 362. and is very far from adding &s;trength and authority to the rule. Speaking of the connection between principals and acce&s;&s;aries, he &s;ays, <Q>yet in con&s;idera|tion of law their offences are quite different; and for that rea&s;on, I pre&s;ume, it is, that if A. be indicted as principal, and B. as acce&s;&s;ary, and both are acquitted, yet B. may be indicted as principal in the &s;ame offence, and his former acquittal is no bar. 1 Hale, 625. On the other hand, it SEEM|ETH to be agreed (1 Hale, 626. 2 Hale, 244.) UPON WHAT GROUNDS I KNOW NOT, that if A. be indicted as principal and acquitted, he cannot be afterwards indicted as acce&s;&s;ary BEFORE the fact. "For," &s;ay &s;ome, IT IS IN SUBSTANCE THE SAME OFFENCE. Others, (Kel. 25. 26) If a man inciteth to the offence, HE IS QUODAMMODO GUILTY OF THE FACT.</Q></P>

<Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> it al&s;o true in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"></HI> By no means. For in the eye of the law the offences of principal and acce&s;&s;ary SPECIFICALLY differ, and full under a quite different con&s;ideration. The point in the ca&s;e reported by K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lyag, 25&mdash;46. which was of an acce&s;&s;ary after the fact, was at length &s;ettled upon &s;ound principles of law and rea&s;on. But the rea&s;oning upon that ca&s;e founded on a di&s;tinction between what preceded or was &s;ub&s;equent to the fact is, I confe&s;s too refined for my comprehen&s;ion; and probably will continue &s;o, till I can remove antient land-marks, and for|get the legal di&s;tinction between principals and acce&s;&s;aries, and every prin|ciple of law founded on it. For if the offences of the principle and acce&s;&s;ary do, in con&s;ideration of law, SPECIFICALLY differ; and if a per&s;on indicted as principal cannot be convicted upon evidence tending <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to prove him to have been an acce&s;&s;ary before the fact, which I think mu&s;t be admitted, I do not &s;ee how an acquittal upon one indictment could be a bar to a &s;econd for an offence &s;pecifically different from it. In the ca&s;e I fir&s;t &s;tated it was no bar, why therefore in the &s;econd?&mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>This I offer as a doubt of my own, which is &s;ubmitted to the opinion of the learned.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>So far Judge Fo&s;ter. We will admit, that, if after this, Judge Black&s;tone had con&s;idered the law as &s;ettled upon rea&s;on and authority, it would have thrown an almo&s;t in&s;uperable difficulty in the way. But he does not, as one of the pri&s;oner's Coun&s;el has &s;aid, &s;peak of it as a SETTLED point. But referring to Hawkins and Fo&s;ter, and not attempting to remove their difficul|ties, he &s;ays, "it is a matter OF SOME DOUBT, whether, if a man be acquit|ted as principal, he can be afterwards indicted as acce&s;&s;ary BEFORE the fact; &s;ince tho&s;e offences are frequently very near allied, and therefore an acquittal of the guilt of one, may be an acquittal of the guilt of the other al&s;o." No man, therefore, reflecting upon the rea&s;on of the law as laid down by Hale and in K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l and con&s;idering the weighty objectious again&s;t it, can undertake to &s;ay that is by any means a &s;ettled point. We on the part of the Commonwealth, think there is &s;o little rea&s;on in it, that we can hardly doubt, but that, whenever this ca&s;e, which is &s;till open for a final deci&s;ion, &s;hall come before the Court, they will not he&s;itate to decide that an acquittal of a man as principal is not any bar to an indictment again&s;t him as acce&s;&s;ary BEFORE the fact. If we
<PB N="39" REF="034040_0040_0FFA48106FFC6C80">
are right on this fir&s;t ground made for the pri&s;oner, and even an ACQUITTAL of him on the former indictment, could not be pleaded to the pre&s;ent one, it makes an entire end of the que&s;tion; and whether the di&s;charge of the for|mer jury was legal or illegal; whether it was done regularly or irregularly, it can make no difference. But as long as the DOUBT DID REMAIN, and it turned out upon the evidence that he could not be convicted as principal, but only as acce&s;&s;ary before, more e&s;pecially as this was induced by his own confe&s;&s;ion and conduct, and in fact became a matter of nece&s;&s;ity and proprie|ty, it would not have been right for the Court to have given him the chance of pleading <HI>auterfoits acquit;</HI> the public ju&s;tice required that &s;o notorious an offender &s;hould not e&s;cape. We contend that it was fair and ju&s;t. The propriety of the mea&s;ure, however, brings us to the la&s;t ground of argument.</P>
<P>As to this great point, the pri&s;oner's coun&s;el rely on the authority of I In&s;t. 227.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 3 In&s;t. 110. Carth. 465. 2 Stra. 984. 4 State trials 232. Lord Delamere's ca&s;e; and 664 Rookwood's ca&s;e; 2 Hawkins chap. 47. &s;ect. 1 and &s;ome other ca&s;es which we will endeavour to an&s;wer. The opinion in Hawkins as well as in the other ca&s;es is grounded upon Lord Coke's doctrine in 1 In&s;t. 227.<HI>b:</HI> but if this can be &s;hown to be it&s;elf without a foundation, at lea&s;t not an inflexible rule, then the fabric they have been rai&s;ing upon it, mu&s;t fall with it, whatever darkne&s;s may have re&s;ted upon this &s;ubject before, yet &s;ince the great con&s;ideration it received in the ca&s;e of the two Kin|lochs, there can remain no doubt now as to the power of the court to di&s;|charge a jury in certain ca&s;es, wherever a nece&s;&s;ity for it may exi&s;t. If the power is once admitted then the court, and the court only, can be the judges when it may be proper to exerci&s;e it. But Kinloch's ca&s;e is &s;aid to be by the con&s;ent of the pri&s;oner. We apprehend this makes no difference. For if the law of the land is, that the court have not the power to di&s;charge a jury once &s;worn in a criminal ca&s;e, then no con&s;ent could give it to them. If they can do it by con&s;ent, they can do it without.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the ca&s;e of the King &amp; Jeffs, 2 Stra. 984. the Court were certainly right in refu&s;ing to di&s;charge the jury, becau&s;e the pro&s;ecutor was not ready with &s;ome of his proof, without which he could not proceed. Had they di&s;charged the jury, it would have been exactly the ca&s;e of Whitebread and Fenwick, a State trials, 715. 831. 832. which has been &s;o much condemn|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="40" REF="034040_0041_0FFA4813CCD998B8">
We do not contend for the principle of that ca&s;e. Be&s;ides all the ca&s;es cited for the pri&s;oner, are ca&s;es where the &s;econd jury mu&s;t have come to try the SAME indictment. Even this, it is admitted, may be done in certain extreme ca&s;es. But they do not apply here; becau&s;e this is the ca&s;e of a new indict|ment, we &s;ay for a different kind of offence, requiring different evidence; and where the evidence which would have been adapted to the former indict|ment, would not convict him on the pre&s;ent one. Have the gentlemen &s;hown any ca&s;e where this may not be done? they tell us Fo&s;ter puts the very in&s;tance, and they would infer that he di&s;approved of it. His language is, in his celebrat|ed argument in the ca&s;e of the Kinloch's "The que&s;tion is not, whether a jury may be di&s;charged after evidence given, in order to the preferring of a new in|dictment better &s;uited to the nature of the ca&s;e: where through the ignorance or collu&s;ion of the officer, or the mi&s;take of the pro&s;ecutor, the fact laid varieth from the real fact, or cometh &s;hort of it in point of guilt. This was fre|quently done, he adds, before the revolution, and in one or two in&s;tances &s;ince." Fo&s;t. 30. Now it appears to us from his mode of putting the ca&s;e, that he was certainly of opinion that the jury might in &s;uch ca&s;e, be di&s;charg|ed; and he even cites Kelyng 26, where the very thing now done was done in that ca&s;e. The gentlemen have told us that ca&s;e in Kelyng was long &s;ince exploded; but they have not &s;hown us how or where; unle&s;s they refer to the followers of Lord Coke. It may be well to remark that Lord Holt was the publi&s;her of Kelyng's reports, and if he had had any difficulty about the power of the court in this re&s;pect, he certainly would have &s;ugge&s;ted the doubt, as he has done in two in&s;tances in pa. 13 and 41, for the con&s;ideration of the learned. And in pa. 47 and 52 of the &s;ame book, it &s;eems to be well agreed that the court may di&s;charge the jury, and take no verdict, and then indict the pri&s;oner over again, and the&s;e ca&s;es are all after evidence gi|ven. And in the ca&s;e of the King ver&s;us Segar and Potter, on an indict|ment for burglary, the jury was di&s;charged, after evidence given, without any que&s;tion as to the right and this was in the 8th. Wm. 3. Comb. 401. The Coun&s;el for the commonwealth have ventured to refer the court to 2 Hale, 295. 296. 297. More we &s;uppo&s;e, for the &s;ake of the note by the editor of that work, than for the text, which is directly again&s;t their propo&s;ition, and where the law is carried much farther than we contend for in this ca&s;e. The jury was not di&s;charged in this ca&s;e for want of witne&s;&s;es, or becau&s;e they were kept out of the way; but &s;olely for the purpo&s;e of preferring a new
<PB N="41" REF="034040_0042_0FFA481A7268E070">
indictment, &s;uited to the truth of the fact; for the &s;ake of public ju&s;tice, and not for oppre&s;&s;ion, or to try the pri&s;oner a &s;econd time on the &s;ame indict|ment, when we might expect better and fuller evidence. It was for the purpo&s;e of trying him for an offence of which he was guilty; and not one of which he was not guilty. If the ca&s;es put by Hale are law, then the authority is very &s;trong for us; for he lays it down, notwith&s;tanding the authority of my Lord Coke, "that nothing is more ordinary than after the jury &s;worn, and charged with a pri&s;oner; and evidence given, yet if it appears to the Court, the &s;ome of the evidence is kept back, or taken off, OR THAT THERE MAY BE A FULLER DISCOVERY, and the offence notorious, as murder or bur|glary, and that the evidence, THO' NOT SUFFICIENT to convict the pri&s;oner, yet gives the Court a great and &s;trong &s;u&s;picion of his guilt, the Court may di&s;charge the jury of the pri&s;oner, and remit him to the gaol FOR FARTHER evidence, and accordingly it hath been practi&s;ed in mo&s;t circuits of England, for otherwi&s;e many notorious murders and burglaries may pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed by the acquittal of a per&s;on probably guilty, where the full evidence is not SEARCHED OUT OR GIVEN." It it not nece&s;&s;ary for us either to approve or di&s;approve of the ca&s;es put by Lord Hale. None of them are like the ca&s;e before the Court, though much &s;tronger; but as to the Editor's note, it is certainly not compo&s;ed with critical accuracy; more e&s;pecially when he refers to Lord Delamere's ca&s;e as the ground of his opinion; which we &s;hall &s;how, by and by, is not at all applicable to the que&s;tion he was con&s;idering. Let it however be &s;aid, that Lord Hale was one of the mo&s;t cautious and humane Judges who&s;e hi&s;tory we know any thing of; and was very far from &s;tretching either law or prerogative for the &s;ake of oppre&s;&s;ing the &s;ubject. And Judge Fo&s;ter, in the argument before cited, referring to 1 Vent. 69. where a jury was di&s;charged, after they were &s;worn, and the trial put off, becau&s;e the witne&s;&s;es were &s;u&s;pected to be tampered with by the pri&s;oner, &s;ays, "this is not the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, and I give no opinion on it; only let it be remembered, that Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Hale ju&s;tifieth this practice, which, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith, prevailed in his time, and had long prevailed, by &s;trong arguments drawn from the ends of government, and the demands of public ju&s;tice."&mdash;But what appears mo&s;t &s;trange to us, is, that the pri&s;oner's coun&s;el &s;hould have mentioned Lord Delamere's ca&s;e as an authority for them, when they mu&s;t have known that the ca&s;es are by no means parallel; more e&s;pecially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they could not have been ignorant of the an&s;wer already given to it by all

the Judges in Kinloch's ca&s;e. 4 State trial, 230. 232. after a lengthy exam|ination of evidence on the part of the Crown, the pri&s;oner, Lord Delamere him&s;elf was de&s;irous of an adjournment. "May it plea&s;e your grace, &s;aid he, a great part of the day is &s;pent, and I would beg the favor of your grace, that I may have favor till to-morrow morning to review the notes I have taken, and then I &s;hall make my defence." The Lord High Steward doubted of his power to adjourn, calling to mind, perhaps, the old tradition of the law; a con&s;iderable conver&s;ation then en&s;ued; the Lord High Stew|ard was willing to adjourn, if he could by law: Lord Delamere. "My Lord, I &s;hall hardly be able to fini&s;h all I have to &s;ay in any convenient time this day." Lord High Steward. "But, my Lord, if an adjournment can|not be by law, I cannot help it." At length the point was referred to the Judges; and they did give their opinions as has been &s;tated on the other &s;ide. But what was the que&s;tion? Not whether the court had the power to di&s;|charge the jury altogether, or not, which is the pre&s;ent que&s;tion; but whe|ther a jury once &s;worn in a capital ca&s;e could be adjourned without giving a verdict. The ca&s;e of an adjournment was what they had then in contempla|tion, and not the ca&s;e of a total di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the jury. "In the common courts, &s;aid the judges, where the trial is by a jury, there the law is clear, the jury once charged can never be di&s;charged till they have given their ver|dict, this is clear; and the rea&s;on of that is, for fear of TAMPERING with the jury." Now if the jury were totally di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, the danger could not hap|pen, for they would never be called again upon the trial of the pri&s;oner. The Judges refu&s;ed to determine as to the power of the Lords; they only &s;aid, that the rea&s;on why a common jury could not be adjourned, failed in that ca&s;e; for there was not the lea&s;t pre&s;umption that the Lords, who were per&s;ons of great integrity and honor, could be prevailed upon in that way. But the Lord High Steward refu&s;ed to adjourn. Now there is not one circum&s;tance in the ca&s;e of Lord Delamere analogous to the que&s;tion before this court. 4. Black. 360. goes no further. It &s;ays the jury cannot be di&s;|charged (unle&s;s in ca&s;es of evident nece&s;&s;ity) till they have given in their ver|dict. But the JUDGES may ADJOURN, while they are drawn to confer, and return to receive the verdict in open court. Judge Black&s;tone is here evi|dently &s;peaking of the manner of proceeding in the trial, and not as to the power to di&s;charge altogether; and although he refers to 1. In&s;t. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">7. &amp; 3. In&s;t. 110. we are to &s;how that they are not of conclu&s;ive weight, however
<PB N="43" REF="034040_0044_0FFA4829DC4025B0">
right as laying down a good general rule. But even if the ca&s;e of the Lord Delamere was applicable to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, we are able to &s;how that it is broken in upon, and is no longer the law; but the Judges have a&s;&s;umed the power to adjourn even in a capital ca&s;e. And upon the authority we &s;hall cite, this court, upon the former trial, did adjourn, and had four con&s;tables &s;worn to keep the jury together. In 6. Term Rep. 530. The King again&s;t William Stone. The Court adjourned the jury. Lord Kenyon ob&s;erved, "that nece&s;&s;ity ju&s;tified what it compelled. And that though it was left to modern times to bring forward ca&s;es of &s;uch extraordinary length, yet no rule could compel the court to continue longer &s;itting than their natural powers would enable them to do the bu&s;ine&s;s of it"&mdash;accommodations were therefore prepared for the jury, and &s;ix bailiffs were &s;worn "well and truly to keep the jury, and neither to &s;peak to them them&s;elves, nor &s;uffer any other per&s;on to &s;peak to them touching any matter relative to this trial."&mdash;</P>
<P>Ambro&s;e Rookwood's ca&s;e proves nothing for the pri&s;oner. The jury were not indeed di&s;charged in that ca&s;e. But if the exceptions had been al|lowed, the indictment mu&s;t have been qua&s;hed; and the jury then &s;worn and charged mu&s;t have been di&s;charged without giving a verdict; yet, &s;ays Judge Fo&s;ter this could not have operated &s;o as to di&s;charge the pri&s;oner from an&s;wering to another indictment for the &s;ame offence. Fo&s;t. 36. Whatever weight, therefore, there is in this ca&s;e, it is again&s;t the pri&s;oner. A di&s;charge upon a defective indictment, no more than an acquittal, could not avail him. 21. Vin. 343. 478. and 2 Hawk. ch. 47. &s;ect. 1. are both grounded on my Lord Coke, 1. In&s;t. 227.<HI>b</HI> and can be of no greater authority than my Lord Coke him&s;elf: it is only citing the &s;ame ca&s;e three or four times over, without affording additional authority. The opinion of Sir Martin Wright has al&s;o been mentioned, in the ca&s;e of the Kinlochs, out of 1 Wil&s;. 157. It is true, Sir Martin Wright was a very learned Judge. But of what con|&s;equence is the opinion of a &s;ingle Judge again&s;t the &s;olemn judgment of his nine a&s;&s;ociates, equally learned as him&s;elf? The King again&s;t Perkins, men|tioned in Carthew, 465. is brought forward to govern this ca&s;e. In the ca&s;e of the Kinlochs the Judges paid no attention or regard whatever to that authority; and &s;aid it was doubtful whether there ever was &s;uch a re&s;olution or no. That at all events it was an extrajudicial opinion. Carthew, there|fore, is quite out of the que&s;tion; it had no weight with very learned Judges

in England, in con&s;idering this very que&s;tion; it can have no weight here; its authority is impeached and de&s;troyed. Deci&s;ions quite to the contrary have taken place &s;ince. See Fo&s;t. 27. 28. 36. 37. we con&s;ider Lord Coke, 1 In&s;t. 227.<HI>b</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> In&s;t. 110. as the great corner&s;tone upon which the gentlemen hope to re&s;t the &s;y&s;tem which they have &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly been building up. My Lord Coke's authority, therefore remains to be inquired into. With the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of Fo&s;ter, we hope to &s;atisfy the court, that it places no ob&s;tacle in the way. The Judges in Kinlochs ca&s;e, Fo&s;t. 27. agreed "that admit|ting the rule laid down by Lord Coke to be a good general rule, yet it can|not be univer&s;ally binding: nor is it ea&s;y to lay down any rule that will be &s;o." Again, by Fo&s;ter him&s;elf, pa. 29. 30. "I take it to be one of tho&s;e que&s;ti|ons, which are not capable of being determined by any general rule that hath hitherto been laid down, or po&s;&s;ibly ever may be.

"It &s;eems that an opinion did once prevail, that a jury, once &s;worn and charged in any criminal ca&s;e what&s;oever, could not be di&s;charged without giving a verdict; but this opinion is exploded in Ferrar's ca&s;e, and it is there called a COMMON TRADITION, which had been held by many learned in the law."</P>
<P>"My Lord Coke was one of tho&s;e learned men who gave into this TRA|DITION, as far, at lea&s;t, as concerneth capital ca&s;es; and he layeth down the rule in very general terms, in the pa&s;&s;ages which have been cited on be|half of the pri&s;oners from his fir&s;t and third In&s;titutes."</P>

<P>"My Lord Coke layeth down the rule in very general terms; but he hath not given us any of the principles of law or rea&s;on whereon he ground|eth it.

<P>The authority which Coke cites is 21 Edw. 3. 18.

Cor. 144.<HI>b.</HI> Bro. Corone, 42. and which prevailed for a long time, that a per&s;on who had once pleaded to i&s;&s;ue, could not after that be admitted to a confe&s;&s;ion in order to &s;ave his own life, by charging other per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed to be his accomplices in the &s;ame fact. But this rule was afterwards relaxed, vide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Hale, 228. of cour&s;e the only authority which Lord Coke relied upon for the &s;upport of his rule, is it&s;elf de&s;troyed. With regard to this point, &s;ays Fo&s;ter, pa. 34. "the admitting, or not admitting per&s;ons to become approvers, was always con&s;idered as a matter of MERE DISCRETION in the Court; as a matter of grace, and not of right: and yet we &s;ee, that in a matter of mere di&s;cretion, the Court did frequently, upon the &s;pecial circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, di&s;charge juries, after they were &s;worn and charged, and had in part heard the evidence."</P>
<P>"The&s;e in&s;tances mu&s;t therefore be con&s;idered as &s;o many exceptions to the general rule; tho', I confe&s;s they do not come up to the ca&s;e of di&s;charging one jury, and bringing the pri&s;oner to his trial by another.</P>
<P>"But &s;till they &s;how, that the rule now contended for on the part of the pri&s;oners, cannot be true in the latitude the words import: and I think they do in part &s;how, what I hinted in the beginning, that no general rule can govern the di&s;cretion of the Court on this que&s;tion in all po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es and circum&s;tances."&mdash;</P>

What then becomes of the inviolability of Lord Coke's rule? We not only find ca&s;es frequently in oppo&s;ition to it, but Judges of the fir&s;t reputation di&s;&s;enting from it in the latitude it is laid down. But, &s;ay the Coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner, the exceptions to the rule are either ca&s;es of extreme nece&s;&s;ity, as the in&s;tance put by Fo&s;ter, pa. 34. of the man in a phrenzy pleading to an indictment, and it appearing to the Court, on the trial, that he is mad, the Judge, in di&s;cretion, may di&s;charge the jury of him, and remit him to gaol, to be tried after the recovery of his under|&s;tanding. 1 Hale, 35. And the ca&s;e of King and Gould, where one of the jurors died; or where it may be done of humanity, as in the ca&s;e of Eliza|beth Meadows, Fo&s;t. 76. who was taken in labour pending the trial; or out of regard to the life of the pri&s;oner, as in the ca&s;e of the Kinlochs, to let them into a defence they could not otherwi&s;e have had. It is true, all the&s;e are ca&s;es depending upon particular circum&s;tances; but then an infinite va|riety of other ca&s;es might happen, which would equally require the interpo|&s;ition of the Court. For if once the power of the Court is admitted, as the gentlemen certainly have admitted it in the&s;e ca&s;es; then all their arguments apply only to the IMPROPER EXERCISE of that power. The Court mu&s;t judge of that; and, in this in&s;tance, they have thought this a proper ca&s;e to call forth their extraordinary powers. But precedents are not wanting to the very point; for in the ca&s;e of Ann Hawkins, cited from the manu|&s;cript of Mr. Ju&s;tice Tracy, in Fo&s;t. 38. We cannot di&s;tingui&s;h the cir|cum&s;tances attending it from tho&s;e in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. In that ca&s;e it was found, UPON THE EVIDENCE ON THE TRIAL, that the fact was not truly

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aid; thereupon the jury was DISCHARGED OF THAT INDICTMENT, AND IT WAS AMENDED; and the pri&s;oner tried upon the AMENDED indict|ment. We would be glad to know what an&s;wer is to be given to this ca&s;e. The ca&s;e of Elizabeth Meadows has already been ob&s;erved upon; it mo&s;t certainly e&s;tabli&s;hes the power of the Court to di&s;charge in oppo&s;ition to Lord Coke. And again, in Fo&s;t. 327. 8. where the learned Judge is argu|ing upon the difference between MURDER &amp; PETIT TREASON, he proceeds thus: "But if through a mi&s;take on the part of the pro&s;ecutor, or through the ignorance or inattention of the officer, a bill be preferred as for murder, and it &s;hould COME OUT IN EVIDENCE, that the pri&s;oner &s;tood in that &s;ort of relation to the decea&s;ed which rendereth the offence PETIT TREASON, I do not think it by any means advi&s;eable to direct the jury to give a verdict of acquittal. For a per&s;on charged with a crime of &s;o heinous a nature, ought not to have the chance given him by the Court of availing him&s;elf of a plea of <HI>auterfoits acquit.</HI> In &s;uch ca&s;e I SHOULD MAKE NO SORT OF DIFFICUL|TY OF DISCHARGING the jury of that indictment, and ordering a fre&s;h in|dictment for petit trea&s;on. In this method the pri&s;oner will have advantage of his peremptory challenges, and the public ju&s;tice will not &s;uffer. This then is deci&s;ive language. But what is the an&s;wer given to it? It is called a chamber opinion, and &s;peculative rea&s;oning.&mdash;But when a Judge of Fo&s;ter's reputation, with his knowledge and experience, who had previous to this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;idered the &s;ubject; who had heard it exhau&s;ted, and every ca&s;e relative to it brought before him for his judgment and deci&s;ion in the ca&s;e of the Kinlochs, by very learned coun&s;el; who had weighed the rule laid down by Lord Coke, and reflected on all its con&s;equences; when &s;uch a Judge with the whole light and learning of a century before him, declares that he would not HESITATE to di&s;charge a jury under circum&s;tances like the pre&s;ent; it is &s;omething more than chamber opinion or &s;peculative rea&s;oning. He mu&s;t have been &s;atisfied it was the law of the land, well &s;ettled and long e&s;tabli&s;hed. A Judge of Fo&s;ter's extreme caution and great learning would not have ventured the expre&s;&s;ions, if there had been any doubt of the law. But what have we &s;aid, or what can we &s;ay, that has not been already much more ably &s;aid in the books upon the &s;ame point. We cannot &s;ee any force in the objections which are made, and we confidently leave them with the court.

<P>We apprehend the ground we have taken, that where one is acquitted as principal, he cannot be again tried as acce&s;&s;ary BEFORE the fact, is &s;ettled and incontrovertible. It was one of the rea&s;ons mentioned at the la&s;t Court, why the jury ought to be di&s;charged. We think it then fell from the Court. The pre&s;ent inquiry is, whether the di&s;charge of the jury from the pri&s;oner, at the la&s;t Court, amounts to an acquittal. The Court will never regret the patient hearing they have given to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> objections. Whatever may be the re&s;ult; whether they &s;hall di&s;charge him, or order him to plead, they mu&s;t be better &s;atisfied that it has undergone a deliberate con&s;ideration, than that the difficulty &s;hould occur, or be &s;ugge&s;ted when it might be too late. As things have happened, we are induced to believe that a hair of the pri&s;oner's head can never be touched upon the pre&s;ent indictment.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="034040_0050_0FFA4852461E5090">
We have heard much &s;aid about the di&s;cretion of the Court. The di&s;|cretion of the Court, in a ca&s;e like the pre&s;ent, where the life of a man is at &s;take, is a &s;trange idea to us! If there is any ca&s;e where the law &s;hould be fixed and inflexible, it is in a capital ca&s;e. The life of a citizen is never to de|pend upon arbitrary will, or private a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ection; and though di&s;cretion is no|thing but exerci&s;ing the be&s;t of one's judgment upon the occa&s;ion that calls for it, yet if it be wilfully abu&s;ed, it is CRIMINAL. When applied to a court of ju&s;tice, it means SOUND di&s;cretion, GUIDED by law. It mu&s;t be govern|ed by RULE, not by HUMOUR. It mu&s;t not be ARBITRARY, VAGUE and FANCIFUL, but LEGAL and REGULAR. Arbitrary di&s;cretion, &s;aid C. J. Pratt, afterwards the illu&s;trious CAMDEN, is contrary to the GENIUS of the COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND, and would be more fit for an ea&s;tern mon|archy than this land of liberty. Co. Lit. 227.&mdash;1 Burr. 560. 570.&mdash;4. Burr. 2539.&mdash;2. Wil&s;. 138.</P>
<P>Does the di&s;charge then amount to an acquittal?&mdash;We think we have &s;hown that this indictment is for the &s;ame offence, and that the pri&s;oner ought not to be twice put in JEOPARDY for it: and that a jury having been once &s;worn in his ca&s;e, and di&s;charged, he never can be put upon his trial again; and that therefore &s;uch di&s;charge has the &s;ame operation as an acquittal upon record.</P>
<P>There are two exceptions to the ca&s;e i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ventris. 1&s;t. It is not a capi|tal ca&s;e. 2dly. It is a ca&s;e in the time of Charles the 2d. And tho' &s;uch a practice might have crept into the Courts in that arbitrary reign, the good &s;en&s;e of after times has entirely exploded it.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid that this was a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. We take the ca&s;e of ne|ce&s;&s;ity to be &s;uch an one as the wit of man cannot fore&s;ee; of cour&s;e it can only be remedied when it really occurs. But a confe&s;&s;ion to a Judge, after the trial has commenced, is not of that extreme kind. If that would warrant a di&s;charge of the jury, the ca&s;e mu&s;t frequently have occurred in England; and yet we find no ca&s;e in the books where a jury was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ver di&s;charged upon that ground.

Suppo&s;e Mr. Attorney would now refu&s;e to pro|ceed again&s;t the pri&s;oner upon this bill, as acce&s;&s;ary, but indict him back again as principal; what would this lead to&mdash;what would be the con&s;equence?&mdash;The Court will ob&s;erve the caution u&s;ed in Kinloch's ca&s;e; every minute particular is entered upon the record, that the ground upon which the Court went might forever appear; and that it &s;hould not operate as an authority upon the general que&s;tion. That is then an authority &s;tanding alone. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e no con&s;ent is entered, nor any other rea&s;on; why the jury were di&s;charged in this ca&s;e no where appears; the record, in this re&s;pect, is defective. In Kinloch's ca&s;e it was expre&s;&s;ly entered, THAT NO EVIDENCE WAS GIVEN. But it is &s;aid that this may be &s;upplied, and the rea&s;ons for the di&s;charge now entered from the notes or minutes taken by the Court. We apprehend not. In Co. Lit. 260.<HI>a</HI> it is laid down, that during the term when any judicial act is done, the record remaineth in the brea&s;t of the Jud|ges of the Court, and in their remembrance, and therefore the roll is alterable during that term, as the Judges &s;hall direct, but when that term is pa&s;t, then the record is in the roll, and admitteth no alteration, averment, or proof to the contrary. We &s;ay that this Court, more e&s;pecially as it is a criminal Court, have not the power to add to, or alter the record of the former Court of Oyer and Terminer.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid the fir&s;t indictment is defective, and we are called upon to &s;upport the goodne&s;s of that indictment. The coun&s;el for the Commonwealth are now willing to acknowledge a mi&s;take of their own, for the &s;ake of puni&s;hing the pri&s;oner.

No Judge can he&s;itate upon the point; on reading the indictment it is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to &s;ay that it is not evident upon the face of it that FRANCIS SHITZ died of the mortal wound received from the pri&s;oner. It is not like the ca&s;e of poi&s;on; that ca&s;e &s;tands alone. It would be nece&s;&s;ary there to &s;tate that the decea&s;ed died by the poi&s;oning; becau&s;e death is not ab&s;olutely the certain and natural con&s;equence of poi&s;oning; a man may be badly poi&s;oned, and yet not die; there are powerful antidotes to poi&s;on, which will effectually counteract it. But when it is &s;tated here that the decea&s;ed received a MORTAL wound, and that he afterwards died, can any one &s;uppo&s;e, for a moment, that it was not of the MORTAL WOUND he died? For unle&s;s death followed, the wound could not be MORTAL. The indict|ment would have been good without &s;lating tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the decea&s;ed LANGUISHED.

But read it as it is: it is all one &s;entence, and the mortal wound refers to and runs through the whole.

<P>The Court, con&s;idering that the pri&s;oner &s;tood mute from ob&s;tinacy, or|dered the plea of NOT GUILTY to be entered for him on the record; which the Clerk did accordingly, and the Attorney General thereupon joined i&s;&s;ue.</P>

<P>We hope that they may not be tried together. It would be a very unfair proceeding. We are willing to try Cox and Donagan to|gether, and will enter into any &s;tipulation to join in the challenges.

<P>The foregoing arguments are blended together from the ob&s;ervations of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the coun&s;el.

<P>FRIDAY, JUNE 15th, 1798. 8 o'clock, A.M.</P>
<P>The three pri&s;oners were brought to the bar.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;rs. HOPKINS &amp; CLYMER mentioned to the Court, that their clients Donagan &amp; Cox wi&s;hed to &s;ay &s;omething to the Court.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident then a&s;ked them, &s;eparately, what they had to &s;ay to the Court.</P>
<P>They then &s;tated to the Court, that they did not wi&s;h to be tried along with John Hauer who had confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf guilty; and hoped the Court would &s;uffer them to be tried by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>MR. HOPKINS then renewed his motion, that the two pri&s;oners &s;hould be tried di&s;tinct from Hauer; and prayed the Court to recommend it to the Attorney General to con&s;ent to it.</P>
<P>The Court &s;aid, if the coun&s;el would &s;how them that they had a power to interfere, and direct the Attorney General how he &s;hould conduct the trial, then perhaps they would exerci&s;e a di&s;cretion; but until then they would not interpo&s;e, becau&s;e they believed no &s;uch power ve&s;ted in the Court.</P>

<P>MR.

<SPEAKER>HOPKINS.</SPEAKER>
<P>When this matter was mentioned at the la&s;t Court, it created doubts in my mind; particularly when the ca&s;e in Dallas is brought into view. In that ca&s;e the pri&s;oners were <HI>Italians;</HI> and between their country and this, there is no reciprocity as to a trial by jury. This ca&s;e is therefore &s;tronger; becau&s;e in England, of which country the&s;e men are &s;ubjects, an American would be entitled to the &s;ame mode of trial.</P>

<SPEAKER>C. SMITH, for the Commonwealth.</SPEAKER>
<P>However this might be, if it &s;tood &s;ingly upon the ca&s;e in Dallas, we do not apprehend to be now nece&s;&s;ary to enquire. Yet even in that ca&s;e, the court appear to have decided with great reluctance, and &s;eem to have wanted nothing but a plau&s;ible rea&s;on to have rejected the motion. That ca&s;e, how|ever, is grounded upon a particular rea&s;on, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the exten&s;ion of the Brit|i&s;h Statute of 28. Edw. 3. by the con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania; which Statute had been in force in the Province previou&s;ly to the revolution.

<P>When we were at Shitz's hou&s;e, the night of the murder, we proceeded to &s;earch whether or no the hou&s;e had been robbed. We went into the back room and examined the che&s;t.

<P>I was at Valentine's, in Shaefer's town, the day before the murder hap|pened, cutting wood for him. Hauer &s;tood at the market hou&s;e, and call|ed me to come to him. He told me I &s;hould come out to his hou&s;e to thre&s;h oats for him. I &s;aid I would come out. But Hauer &s;aid, no, you won't come. He a&s;ked me again if I WOULD come, and I &s;aid, yes. He again &s;aid, you won't come, "I had better leave the hor&s;e for you here." He left the hor&s;e for me, and I went out. It was half an hour after 7 o'clock when I came to his hou&s;e. When I came there, I wanted to know where to put the hor&s;e. I went up to the hou&s;e, knocked at the door, but nobody an&s;wered. I then took the hor&s;e to the &s;table.

When I went into the hou&s;e, Hauer was in bed near the window; Mrs. Hauer was &s;itting on a chair a&s;leep. I a&s;ked Hauer, where was Pat. Donagan. He &s;aid he rode down to Ilig's that morning.

Deefinger called out "John Hauer!" and as &s;oon as he was called, he opened the door, and had a candle in his hand ready lighted. As &s;oon as he opened the door, he went back with the candle; we went in with him. He &s;aid nothing at all, but &s;et the candle on the table, and went behind the &s;tove.

Hauer &s;aid,&mdash;I think, if old Shitz HAD DIVIDED HIS ESTATE SHARE &amp; SHARE ALIKE, IT WOULD NOT BE SO.&mdash;I &s;aid I could tell no|thing about it. Hauer told me to tell the boys this. I did tell them. It is about three years ago. This time three years ago, at hay-making, Hauer came to work for Francis Shitz. After &s;upper, he bade good night, and went out of doors. After the family had gone to bed, &s;omething came in the hou&s;e, and rattled and made a great noi&s;e. Francis Shitz went down and looked, but &s;aw nothing. He came up &s;tairs again. After a while it began again, and &s;eemed like the rattling among old iron. Francis Shitz came to my bed, and told me to go down, and look what it was. I went down &s;tairs; and went from the &s;tair-ca&s;e to a &s;mall chamber adjoining the room. From thence I went into the room. From the room I went into the kitchen&mdash;I could &s;ee nothing in the kitchen; but there is a &s;mall room un|der the &s;tair ca&s;e&mdash;not very large. I opened the door of it, and reached in|to it with my hand, and caught &s;ome per&s;on on the brea&s;t: I perceived it was a HUMAN BEING, and dragged him out&mdash;and it was&mdash;JOHN HAU|ER! Then, when I got him out, he laughed. I a&s;ked him what he was doing there. He told me I &s;hould not tell the boys; but I did tell them.</P>
<P>Hauer told me it was the gho&s;t of old Shitz that had come to his hou&s;e; and he told me if I did not believe it, I might come and &s;ee it.</P>
<P>The will of old Peter Shitz was then read in evidence to the jury. It was dated on the 8th of April, 1795&mdash;and proved on the 30th of April, 1795.

I did bleed her. Hauer a&s;ked me if I had not in my &s;hop, a medicine, which he called WIEDERKOMME drops. I told him I had not; nor did I know my medicine of the kind. He told me if I had them I &s;hould not be afraid to give them to him; he meant to do no harm with them; If I would let him have about a gill, he would give me TWENTY dollars. He then &s;aid, he was convinced I had tho&s;e kinds of drops, as he had got them from other phy&s;icians before; that he knew phy&s;icians generally objected to fell them. I told him I really had nothing of the kind, or I would give it to him with plea&s;ure if I had them. He then &s;aid he was convinced I had them, and if I would let him have a gill he would give me TWENTY pounds. I told him I really had not the medicine. He then a&s;ked me if I would not write to the city, and get them for him from the apothecary. I promi&s;ed him I would, in order to get rid of him; and he and his wife went off. About two weeks afterwards, he came to me again, in company with Pat. Dona|gan, and a&s;ked me if I had got tho&s;e drops for him. I told him I had not, I had no opportunity of writing. Pat. &s;aid he was convinced I had them in my &s;hop, and would not give them to him; he &s;aid he had got &s;ome pre|vious to this at Bethlehem; and &s;ome of Dr. Luther. I declared to him I had them not. Then Hauer pulled out a bag of money; he &s;aid it contained FIFTY pounds; I believed it did, for it was a large bag of dollars. He then told me, if I would give him a gill of tho&s;e drops, he would give me that money. I told him as before, I had not got them. I a&s;ked them to de&s;cribe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he colour and &s;mell; perhaps I would know what they wanted. Hauer could not de&s;cribe the &s;mell; but he pointed to a bottle that was &s;tanding on one of the &s;helves, which was of a dark brown, and &s;aid it had that colour. I told him I did not know by his de&s;cription what it was.&mdash;Pat. then be|gan to talk. He &s;eemed VERY ANXIOUS and PRESSING to have tho&s;e drops; and &s;aid, if I would get him the drops, he would ride up to Harri&s;|burgh, to Dr. Luther, and get the Latin or Engli&s;h name of them, that I

He &s;aid Dr. Luther mu&s;t know the name of them, as he had got &s;ome from him before, BUT THEY WERE NOT STRONG ENOUGH.&mdash;I told him if he would do that, get me the Latin name, I would certainly get him the drops from the city.&mdash;On this they left me.&mdash;I a&s;ked them what the intention of them was&mdash;what they wanted them for. They &s;miled and did not tell me. I &s;aid to Pat, I &s;uppo&s;e you want to try projects with the&s;e drops. He &s;miled, and &s;aid, yes.

<P>It appeared to me extraordinary, &s;o much money being offered; and I mentioned the circum&s;tance to Frederick Hubley. They laid me under no injunctions of &s;ecrecy.&mdash;As an apothecary, I would have &s;old a gill of LAUDANUM for a dollar. But I would give no man a gill of LAUDANUM, unle&s;s I knew what he wanted to do with it, or could judge of the effects of it.&mdash;I &s;ell large quantities of ARSENIC; I would have &s;old them an ounce of that for &s;ix pence; that would have been enough to kill any man.

<P>I was a&s;ked by Squire Shaefer to carry Hauer to goal. When we were on the road, I &s;aid to him, John, this is a very bad affair which has happen|ed; and you &s;eem very much to be blamed; and it would be my advice to you, if you know any thing about the bu&s;ine&s;s, to inform of it. Tell me or &s;ome other per&s;on, it will be a benefit to you. He &s;aid he was clear of it, he knew nothing about it. I travelled on with him a mile or two, and put the que&s;tion again, and told him it would be much in his favor, for, by the judgment of the whole neighborhood, he knew &s;omething about it. He then a&s;ked me, if it would clear him in ca&s;e he would turn &s;tate's evi|dence. I told him it certainly would, and it would be his be&s;t way to in|form, if he knew any thing about it. I will &s;ay nothing more, &s;aid he, till I &s;ee a lawyer. I told him a lawyer could do him no more than another. He gave the &s;ame an&s;wer again. We came riding on&mdash;I &s;aid, John, I wi&s;h

I could come up with the two villains, that I might get the 500 dollars that are adverti&s;ed. He &s;aid, if I could get bail, and go over the river with you, to night, we could get them 500 dollars. Well, &s;aid I, John, who have you &s;u&s;picions of? He &s;aid, I have &s;u&s;picions of Peter M'Donough. I a&s;ked him what rea&s;ons he had to &s;u&s;pect Peter M'Donough. He told me, that Peter M'Donough had a&s;ked him if the Shitz's had a good deal of money by them. That at another time he had told him he never would work any more, and he would live very well. And, be &s;aid, Peter M'Donough was at work o|ver the river, and he could get him that night, and a&s;ked me if I would be one of his bail. I told him we would &s;ee about it when we got to Har|ri&s;burgh. We came to Harri&s;burgh. He wanted to &s;ee Mr. Fi&s;her. Mr. Fi&s;her was not within. His next choice was Mr. Patter&s;on; he was not at home. He then made choice of Mr. Laird. Mr. Laird came down with me to Mr. Zeigler's. We took him into a back room. Mr. Laird told him it would be prudent to tell every thing he knew about the bu&s;ine&s;s. Hauer a&s;ked Mr. Laird, if it would clear him, if he would turn &s;tate's evi|dence. Mr. Laird told him the Court could not pardon him, it mu&s;t de|pend upon the governor. He would then tell nothing, and I put him to gaol.</P>

unle&s;s he was overcome with rage&mdash;Oh, &s;aid Donagan, for a few hundred pounds I would get hands to put both away&mdash;examinant need not look about him for it&mdash;examinant agreed to it. Donagan told examinant he &s;hould mention it once to Peter M'Donoughy&mdash;examinant &s;poke to him of it ac|cordingly, in the new barn at Illigs, where he was eating grapes&mdash;M'Do|noughy &s;aid he did not like to do it, but he would mention it to his brother Hugh M'Donoughy. Afterwards Peter and Hugh M'Donoughy went down to Hacks, where Charles M'Manus was digging a mill race to &s;peak to him, whether he would not be concerned: This was about oat-harve&s;t. Charles M'Manus came up, and he and examinant rode over to Peter M'Donoughy's in the night time. Upon talking of it that night they gave up the &s;cheme. At that time examinant had not informed Peter M'Do|noughy nor Charles M'Manus of the names of the per&s;ons to be killed. The matter was thus depending till flax breaking time, which was the week after the la&s;t Supreme Court at Harri&s;burg&mdash;Then Peter M'Donoughy's wi&s;e came over to examinant's hou&s;e and called Patrick Donagan away from the flax-break. He, Donagan, went with her to her hu&s;band. There they agreed how the murder &s;hould be done. When Patrick Donagan came home he told examinant the manner they &s;ettled to do it. He &s;aid Peter M'Do|noughy, Hugh M'Manus and one Patrick (who is now in town here) would commit the murder. But that Hugh M'Manus and THAT Patrick would have one hundred pounds in ca&s;h after it was done, which Donagan mu&s;t pay them. The affair, then, went to nothing becau&s;e Patrick Donagan did not get the money from Illig who owed him money. Peter M'Donoughy in the &s;ame week gave Charles M'Manus nine pounds to purcha&s;e the pi&s;tols and knife at Lanca&s;ter. It thus depended for a time, and as Charles M'Ma|nus told examinant, he had informed Francis Cox, James Evans, and a &s;hoemaker who lives in Manheim in the county of Lanca&s;ter of it. The &s;hoemaker and Cox, as Charles M'Manus &s;aid, were to go with him to Geiger's tavern, if it was nece&s;&s;ary to be witne&s;&s;es that he remained in the hou&s;e. In the winter afterwards when examinant and Patrick Donagan, were cutting wood in the woods, Peter M'Donoughy and Charles M'Ma|nus came to them. It was then concluded between them to commit the murder on the night upon which it was afterwards executed. Charles. M'Manus propo&s;ed that the people in the hou&s;e &s;hould all be murdered and the hou&s;e burned that no jury could be had on their bodies. To thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

Peter M'Donoughy agreed; but Patrick and examinant would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to it, becau&s;e of the guiltle&s;s per&s;ons who were in it. Indeed Patrick Donagan always &s;aid he him&s;elf could not undertake it, it was again&s;t him, but he would get people to do it, and &s;o he did too&mdash;Peter M'Donoughy had money due to him from one El&s;er, on Middle creek, with which he pur|cha&s;ed a mare from one Frederick Bollman in Meyer's-town, to give to Charles M'Manus that he might go away with after the murder. In the winter ju&s;t before Chri&s;tmas Peter M'Donoughy and Molly Farley rode down to Manheim to Charles M'Manus to &s;peak to him about the murder. Peter M'Donoughy afterwards told examinant that Charles M'Manus &s;aid, if examinant would give it up, he, Charles, would &s;hoot him through the head. Peter M'Donoughy &s;aid they would meet at Lebanon. Examinant went to Lebanon, on that day which was the Sunday before the murder, where he put up at Bowman's tavern. Charles M'Manus came thither, examinant told him nothing &s;hould be done. Examinant &s;aid nothing to Peter in Lebanon, but he overtook them as they were watering their hor&s;es in Quittapahilla&mdash;they &s;topped at Geiger's tavern. When they left Geiger's examinant told Charles M'Manus the murder &s;hould be given up. Upon this Charles &s;aid to Peter, if this is given up, then we will rob Graybill and Shenk of their money. The next day Charles M'Manus went to Peter M'Donoughy's, when the affair was begun afre&s;h. Patrick Donagan told this to examinant, and &s;aid if it was not pur&s;ued up they would kill exami|nant&mdash;upon which examinant &s;aid to Patrick, he was bad off; if they do it, he would be hanged&mdash;if he refu&s;ed, they would kill him. Patrick told ex|aminant to get &s;ome per&s;on into the hou&s;e with him who might be witne&s;s of his being at home&mdash;Patrick Donagan told examinant that as a token for Charles M'Manus, Peter M'Donoughy was to lay a handkerchief in the hor&s;e-trough if &s;trangers were in the hou&s;e when he came there on the night the murder was to be committed; if no handkerchief was in the trough, he might come &s;traight in; and that he would get out of the hou&s;e by a hole in the wall. Molly Farley took a pi&s;tol and two candles which Patrick Donagan gave her, to Peter M'Donoughy's hou&s;e; but examinant does not know that &s;he knew of the intended murder. On the night of the murder the examinant was not out of his hou&s;e, he was at Shaefers-town that day, and took George Baker home with him, who he really wanted as thre&s;h oats, and al&s;o to be a witne&s;s for him, if the murder took effect th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">

So I promi&s;ed him then to go down the next day. So he told me, may be your hor&s;es are tired; you can ride one of mine; and he took of the &s;addle and bridle off his own hor&s;e, and let him go in the yard. The next day I went to Fahn&s;tock's.

<P>Three years ago again&s;t next harve&s;t, my brother Francis went to haul &s;tones for the new church at Shaefer's-town. When he came home he could not unhitch his hor&s;es.

Hoffman and the girl, that is now his wife, and two other girls, and Hoffman's &s;on John, were in the field. We were all &s;o &s;ick we vomited all the time. Hoffman was not quite &s;o &s;ick as the re&s;t of us, and he fed the hor&s;es. The vomiting continued all that day; and the next day we felt very weak. Hoffman's wife, who was then a maid in the hou&s;e, cooked the breakfa&s;t that day; it was coffee and bread and butter. We never had been affected &s;o before. I don't know if any &s;trange per&s;on had been about the hou&s;e that day. Hauer often came there about that time; I cannot tell how often; but he went about the hou&s;e wherever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> plea&s;ed.</P>

La&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was a year I had hired my&s;elf to Jacob Shitz, my father's brother's &s;on, at Tulpehocken. Hauer, with whom I then lived, had gone over to Francis Shitz's. When he came back, I told him I was going on Sunday to Jacob Shitz's. On Sunday it rained, and I could not go. Hauer then told me I &s;hould not go, that he would &s;how me a way how I &s;hould get a pur&s;e every morning that would have five doubloons in it. That he him&s;elf could not get it, but that I could. I &s;aid to Hauer that I could not get it. Hauer then &s;wore unmercifully that I could; and he told me he mu&s;t fetch drops from Lebanon. He went on Monday up to Lebanon. When he came back again he &s;aid one &s;ort was WIEDERKOMME DROPS, the other I don't know what it was he called it. He had three bottles, one was bigger than the other two, which were but &s;mall phials. Hauer &s;aid, now we will try &s;omething. I &s;aid I did not wi&s;h to do it, I would rather not. Hauer told me I &s;hould try it, he would be bail to me nothing &s;hould hap|pen to me. Hauer told me that Shaefer and Bomberger [they were the executors under Peter Shitz's will, and the guardians of young Peter] wanted to bind me out, that they were at his hou&s;e, and wanted to get me, and told him they would have me dead or alive. He &s;cared me &s;o much that I hid my&s;elf; becau&s;e he &s;aid they came every day. I told Hauer he lied. He &s;wore again unmercifully, that he did not. I then kept my&s;elf con|cealed &s;till. Then Hauer &s;aid, we will try to get the pur&s;e; and he drank &s;ome of the drops; and I drank &s;ome of them too. He drank out of the big bottle, which he &s;aid were WIEDERKOMME DROPS, I drank of the &s;ame. I drank al&s;o out of the TWO SMALL PHIALS, but I don't know if Hauer drank any out of them or not. I did not &s;ee him do it.&mdash;Then Hauer &s;aid he would not try that night, he thought it was not worth while.</P>
<P>Some time after this, we went together down to Wolfer&s;berger's barn. Solomon Hauer went along with us. John Hauer &s;aid, if we would not do as he told us he would give us an unmeciful beating; if we would not tie our&s;elves up as he told us, he would &s;how us &s;ome other things.

It had been u&s;ed for a plow line, and to tie the hor&s;e. I did not &s;ee the man with the pur&s;e. The rope was doubled round my neck. The joi&s;t is 11 or 12 feet above the thre&s;hing floor. The rope took the &s;kin off my neck, but did not hur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> me much. Solomon &s;aid he would tie a rope round his neck, but he did not do it.

They &s;aid they were very &s;orry that it happened &s;o that all went wrong. After that Solomon a&s;ked me to go to|wards Bethlehem with him, where he lived. John Hauer told me I &s;hould go along with him, that it might not be found out that the &s;kin was off my neck. John Hauer often told me I &s;hould tell nothing of it, and I pro|mi&s;ed him I would not. When I came from Bethlehem I hired my&s;elf to my brother Francis, and Hauer again told me not to tell.

again&s;t them; they are apt to lay hold of the minds of men; but the jury ought to dive&s;t them&s;elves of all prejudices: they have &s;olemnly appealed to their God, to try them according to the evidence. That the evidence on the part of the pro&s;ecution was inconclu&s;ive and un&s;atisfactory, and not &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the life of a &s;parrow, much le&s;s that of a man; the whole of it is merely pre&s;umptive&mdash;there is no direct evidence.

<P>I have known Patrick Donagan about two years. I cannot &s;ay any harm of him; he behaved well as long as he worked with me. He worked with me &s;ix or &s;even weeks, or two months, la&s;t Summer. He worked thro' the neighborhood. I heard no ill character of him. He was very indu&s;trious, and had earned money with me. He depo&s;ited near &pound;200 with me, to keep for him. He came to my hou&s;e the night of the murder. I was not as home when he came; I was at Shaefer's town, 8 miles off. I do not know any thing el&s;e but that he was at my hou&s;e all night. I &s;aw him go to bed: Our u&s;ual bed time is about 9 o'clock. When I got up in the morning, I &s;aw him come in the &s;ame door he went out of the evening before. We had to &s;ettle for quarrying &s;tone; he &s;aid he came on that account. He a&s;ked me if I was going to Philadelphia &s;oon, he wanted to &s;end a letter. So I gave him pen, ink and paper, and he wrote a letter that morning. While he was writing, one Nipe, from Shaefer's-town, came for him&mdash;&s;aid he was &s;ent for him. The man called me out, and told me what had happened at Shitz's hou&s;e. The man told me they &s;u&s;pected Pat. was concerned in the murder; and a&s;ked me if he &s;taid all night. I &s;aid, yes. He then went in, and told him what he came for. Pat. &s;aid, my God, can it be true, or &s;ome &s;uch words&mdash;and he DESIRED ME to give him a few lines to Squire Shaefer, that he was all night in my hou&s;e. I told him I would go up my&s;elf, I was anxious to &s;ee how that misfortune happened. I told Squire Shaefer, I was mo&s;t &s;ure he &s;tayed all night in my hou&s;e that night. They thought he was clear of it and let him go.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="034040_0085_0FFA4941104D1880">
He did not &s;eem unwilling to go. I could not &s;ee that be altered his countenance; nor did he run off after he was di&s;charged. He was in the neighborhood for &s;ome weeks before he was apprehended again.</P>

<P>He had often &s;lept at my hou&s;e before. He &s;aid he &s;lept with my &s;on that night. There were other beds empty in the room. His home was at Hauer's immediately previous to this.</P>

<P>I do not know much of Donagan or Cox. Donagan worked in the neighborhood about three years ago. He was an indu&s;trious &s;ober man, and bore a good character through the neighborhood for what I know.</P>
<P>Cox had a good character in my neighborhood three or four years ago. He went to Ireland, and came back again. I never heard any thing again&s;t him till this.</P>

<P>Jacob Keller, Leonard Illig, James Douglas and Philip Caffery were likewi&s;e called to &s;peak of their characters, which they did much in the &s;ame terms as George Illig and Hyp&s;man. The pri&s;oners called no other witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>MEMORANDUM.</P>
<P>When John Hauer was brought to the bar and told to hold up his hand, he did hold up his hand; and from his whole appearance, and from a variety of circum&s;tances, there was no room to doubt, but that he &s;tood MUTE through ob&s;tinacy. He had previou&s;ly enquired, if one who was crazy could be hanged. It evidently appeared that he wi&s;hed to be thought in a &s;tate of lunacy or derangement; but he did not affect it with a &s;ufficient de|gree of art; nor was there the lea&s;t appearance of derangement in his eye. He kept him&s;elf in a filthy &s;ituation; would &s;peak to no one; and when any per&s;on would go near him, he would bite at them, and if he could reach them, he would abu&s;e them greatly. When brought to the bar, his ap|pearance was very di&s;gu&s;ting. But no &s;ugge&s;tion was made to the Court by his coun&s;el, or others, that he was NON COMPOS: If there had been any &s;uch &s;ugge&s;tion, the Court would have impannelled a jury to enquire whe|ther
<PB N="85" REF="034040_0086_0FFA494A6A11AF10">
he &s;tood ob&s;tinately mute, or whether he was dumb <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> vi&s;itations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> But as &s;tanding mute is not now &s;o penal as formerly; and as in &s;uch ca&s;e the Court are directed to enter the plea of NOT GUILTY, by act of a&s;&s;embly, they did not con&s;ider them&s;elves as bound <HI>ex officio</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch a jury <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and it was not prayed for by his coun&s;el, who had actually pleaded in his behalf the plea which the Court overruled.</P>
<P>When the evidence was all clo&s;ed, Mr. DUNCAN addre&s;&s;ed the Court to the following effect. Me&s;&s;rs. ELDER, LAIRD, FISHER and CLYMER gave the &s;ame rea&s;ons to the Court for their conduct to John Hauer, when Mr. Duncan had fini&s;hed. The&s;e five gentlemen were of Coun&s;el for John Hauer.</P>
<P>The Coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner, John Hauer, before the Coun&s;el for Patrick Donagan and Francis Cox, proceed with their defence, beg leave to &s;tate to the Court, that on this, as well as on the former trial, they have endeavored to di&s;charge their duty towards him faithfully, to the extent of their &s;lender abilities. They believe that if John Hauer, on the former trial, had not thought proper to take his ca&s;e out of their hands, probably he would not now have been in confinement. But as John Hauer &s;ent for the Judges, and confe&s;&s;ed his concern in the very &s;oul and barbarous murder committed on his brother-in-law Francis Shitz, and having, when brought to the bar the next morning, publicly pronounced the truth of that confe&s;&s;ion, and per&s;i&s;ted in it; and as John Hauer during the proceedings, and upon his arraignment, upon the pre&s;ent indictment, has remained mute; whether ob&s;tinately, or by the vi&s;itation of God, they pretend not to &s;ay; and fur|ther, has declined all intercour&s;e with his coun&s;el; having attended the trial, and examined the witne&s;&s;es; they therefore, con&s;ider it their duty to be &s;ilent, and now deliver up John Hauer to the Court and to the Jury; well &s;atisfied that the Court will con&s;ider and give weight to any favorable circum&s;tance that may exi&s;t in his ca&s;e. They are induced to this mea&s;ure from a &s;en&s;e of its propriety, from a re&s;pect to the Court, and a regard to their own characters. They would, however, have it under&s;tood, that they have not been awed into it, by the dread of popular re&s;entment and fury, which may have been excited again&s;t them for the part which they have taken in defence of John Hauer; this they mo&s;t heartily de&s;pi&s;e. For though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> STOOD AT THE BAR COVERED OVER WITH THE BLOOD OF HIS BROTHER,
<PB N="86" REF="034040_0087_0FFA16221AD73740">
it would have been their duty to have become his coun&s;el; and having once undertaken his defence, not to have defended him with their be&s;t exertions, would have been a violation of their oaths, a ba&s;e de&s;ertion of a man who had put his life in their hands, and have rendered them unworthy members of a very honorable profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. ELDER addre&s;&s;ed the jury on behalf of the two other pri&s;oners; and Mr. CLYMER followed him, but did not fini&s;h his &s;peech; as one of the jurors had taken ill, and declared he could not &s;et it out all night. Every body was exce&s;&s;ively fatigued; the Court therefore adjourned at 12 o'clock at night, till 8 the next morning. Four bailiffs were &s;worn, as before, to keep the jury together.</P>
<P>For the &s;ake of brevity, the &s;umming up will be given as one &s;peech on each &s;ide, and all the ob&s;ervations will be blended together.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. CLYMER for the pri&s;oners, DONAGAN &amp; COX.</SPEAKER>
<P>GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,</P>
<P>Although a very atrocious murder has been committed, yet I tru&s;t the jury will not be &s;o far incen&s;ed again&s;t the enormity of the crime, as to di&s;able them from judging calmly and deliberately upon the ca&s;e of the pri&s;oners. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e I apprehend there is no evidence to &s;atisfy a wary mind of their guilt. To convict, the evidence ought to be certain and &s;trong; it &s;hould be &s;o manife&s;t that it cannot be contradicted. There is no po&s;itive evidence again&s;t Donagan and Cox; it is altogether circum&s;tantial and pre&s;umptive. To convict of murder the pre&s;umptions ought to be violent, nearly amounting to full proof; like the common in&s;tance put in the books, of a man found &s;uddenly dead in the room, and another be found running out in ha&s;te with a bloody &s;word in his hand. But light or ra&s;h pre&s;umptions, &s;ays Lord Chief Baron Gilbert, weigh nothing. Gilb. Ev. 157&mdash;8. 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ac. 311. And in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Hale 289. That humane judge, &s;peaking of pre&s;ump|tive evidence, &s;ays that it mu&s;t be very warily pre&s;&s;ed, for it is better five guilty per&s;ons &s;hould e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed, than one innocent per&s;on &s;hould die; which is al&s;o &s;aid in 4 Black. 358. Lord Hale not only &s;peaks thus, but he gives us &s;ome remarkable in&s;tances to &s;how the danger of relying on &s;uch evidence, and how ea&s;ily the mind may be mi&s;led by a variety of cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="87" REF="034040_0088_0FFA494E411D9560">
&s;eemingly tending to e&s;tabli&s;h a fact, but which has afterwards been found never to have happened. I will read you the&s;e ca&s;es, Gentlemen, in order to put you upon your guard again&s;t too ea&s;y a belief of &s;uch evidence as exi&s;ts in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; you have con&s;ciences to &s;atisfy, and I am per|&s;uaded you will not give a verdict which, when you come to reflect upon it afterwards, will rankle in your minds to the late&s;t period of your lives. You will therefore, Gentlemen, require &s;trong evidence before you will venture to take away the lives of the pri&s;oners, you, I am &s;ure, will not convict upon conjecture; or where there is even a rea&s;onable ground to doubt. The&s;e men may be guilty; that is a matter with their con&s;ciences; it does not appear &s;o, I apprehend, from the evidence. It is much &s;afer therefore to acquit them. If they &s;hould e&s;cape unde&s;ervedly, they &s;till have their account to &s;ettle with their God. They may go hence, and hereafter lead the lives of good citizens; and by their good conduct atone for their former offences. The thief upon the cro&s;s was pardoned at the la&s;t hour. I however, declare, that if I believed them to be guilty, I would not ri&s;e in their defence.</P>
<P>"If, &s;ays Lord Hale, a hor&s;e be &s;tolen from A. and the &s;ame day B. be found upon him, it is a &s;trong pre&s;umption that B. &s;tole him; yet I do re|member before a very learned and wary judge, in &s;uch an in&s;tance, B. was condemned and executed at Oxford a&s;&s;izes; and yet, within two a&s;&s;izes after, C. being apprehended for another robbery and convicted, upon his judgment and execution confe&s;&s;ed he was the man that &s;tole the hor&s;e, and being clo&s;ely pur&s;ued de&s;ired B. a &s;tranger, to walk his hor&s;e for him, while he turned a&s;ide upon a nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion and e&s;caped: and B. was appre|hended with the hor&s;e and died innocently."</P>
<P>"I would never," he adds, pa. 290. "convict any per&s;on of murder or man&s;laughter, unle&s;s the fact were proved to be done, or at lea&s;t the body found dead, for the &s;ake of two ca&s;es&mdash;one was thus: An uncle, who had the bringing up of his niece, to whom he was heir at law, correcting her for &s;ome offence, &s;he was heard to &s;ay, GOOD UNCLE DO NOT KILL ME; after which time the child could not be found, whereupon the uncle was committed upon &s;u&s;picion of murder, and admoni&s;hed by the ju&s;tices of a&s;&s;ize to find out the child by the next a&s;&s;izes, again&s;t which time he could not find her, but brought another child as like her in per&s;on and years as he
<PB N="88" REF="034040_0089_0FFA15D892B33F28">
could find, and apparelled her like the true child, but on examination &s;he was found not to be the true child; upon the&s;e pre&s;umptions he was found guilty and executed. But the truth was, the child being beaten ran away, and was received by a &s;tranger, and afterwards when &s;he came of age to have her land, came and demanded it, and was directly proved to be the true child." Now, gentlemen, upon pre&s;umptions as &s;trong as tho&s;e, one would &s;carcely he&s;itate to convict; yet we find how fallacious they were. By cru&s;ting them, you may &s;ometimes puni&s;h the guilty; but too frequently you may de&s;troy the innocent. We do not pretend to &s;ay, that in every in|&s;tance pre&s;umptions are to be avoided; but we de&s;ire to put you on your guard again&s;t too ea&s;y an attention to them. Let not the magnitude of the crime &s;o far rou&s;e your indignation, as to induce you to li&s;ten to circum|&s;tances like the pre&s;ent, and by the aid of prejudice, which may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eal upon you without your knowing it, unle&s;s you firmly re&s;olve to re&s;i&s;t it, and con&s;ider the ca&s;e as if you had never heard of it before, give a weight to the evidence which it does not de&s;erve.</P>
<P>The in&s;tances which have already happened ought to alarm you, left induc|ed by &s;pecious appearances, but which are yet entirely deceptious, you too, may bring innocent men to an unmerited end. It is true where the fact in|tended to be proved is &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly the con&s;equence of the circum&s;tances, that it could have happened upon no other principle, the human mind is bound to a&s;&s;ent to its truth; but if it may or may not follow from &s;uch circum&s;tances, it then becomes a matter of doubt and uncertainty, and we are equally bound to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it. The other ca&s;e, gentlemen is thus &s;tated by the &s;ame great au|thority. "Another ca&s;e happened in my remembrance in Stafford&s;hire, where A was long mi&s;&s;ing, and upon &s;trong pre&s;umptions B was &s;uppo&s;ed to have murdered him, and to have con&s;umed him to a&s;hes in an oven, that he &s;hould not be found, whereupon B. was indicted of murder and convicted and executed, and within one year after, A. returned, being indeed &s;ent beyond &s;ea by B. again&s;t his will; and &s;o, tho' B. ju&s;tly de&s;erved death, yet he was really not guilty of that offence, for which he &s;uffered."&mdash;We lay the&s;e authorities before you for your con&s;ideration, and we have no doubt, gentlemen but that they will have the effect with you which they ought to have.&mdash;So, in 8. Mod. 249. Gilbert Chief Baron declares, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall not be found guilty, and hanged upon pre&s;umption.</P>

In the ca&s;e of the King again&s;t Ma&s;on, on an indictment for maliciou&s;ly and piratically burning a &s;hip, it was proved that the defendant, who was ma&s;ter of the &s;hip, tampered with the carpenter to knock her on the head; that on the day the &s;hip was burnt, he made all the crew drunk, and then ordered a fire to be made in the cabin, where there had been none for a month before that time, and the defendant and mo&s;t of the crew then went on &s;hore, except two, who were very drunk; that there was but one bucket belonging to the &s;hip, which the defendant had ordered a &s;ailor to flag overboard the day be|fore the &s;hip was burnt&mdash;Upon this evidence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the book, the pre&s;umption was very &s;trong, that the &s;hip was burnt by that fire which was fir&s;t made in the cabin; but this being only pre&s;umption, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> direct proof, the de|fendant was acquitted. 8. Mod. 74. And in the &s;ame book, pa. 66, we find the ca&s;e of the King again&s;t Sprigg and Oakley thus reported: "The defendants were tried at the Old Bailey upon an indictment for PIRACY, in &s;inking a &s;hip near the I&s;le of Man.&mdash;The evidence was thus: Sprigg bought this &s;hip, and made the other defendant, Oakley, ma&s;ter thereof; and hav|ing freighted her, he in&s;ured &pound;.500 on the &s;hip, and &pound;.400 on the cargo, to the We&s;t-Indies. Afterwards they put to &s;ea, and run the goods upon the coa&s;t of England. They put to &s;ea again; and about two days afterwards the &s;hip was &s;unk; and then he prote&s;ted at the next port, that both the &s;hip and the cargo were lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The proof again&s;t the ma&s;ter was, that the day before this &s;hip was lo&s;t, he took notice that the &s;hip's boat was out of repair, and de&s;ired &s;ome of the men to &s;top the chinks therein, for that he did not know how &s;oon they might have occa&s;ion to make<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;e thereof: that the next day he de&s;ired one of the &s;ailors to &s;ee how deep the water in the pump was, who in a quarter of an hour before had pumped till it was no more than two inches deep; but now&punc; to his great &s;urprize, found it &s;even inches deep; thereupon he, and the re&s;t of the &s;hip's crew began, and continued to pump, but &s;till the water became higher in the &s;hip, and within half an hour was fifteen inches high: that thereupon the &s;ailor who fir&s;t pumped, and &s;ome of the re&s;t of the &s;hip's crew, offered to go down into the hold, but the ma&s;ter would not &s;uffer any of them to go down, nor any body to be there be&s;ides him&s;elf and Sprigg, who was all the time below, which was proved by the &s;ailors; and that the water could not flow in &s;o fa&s;t, unle&s;s the &s;hip was bored, or broken in the bottom&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="034040_0091_0FFA495BB1E79AB0">
The proof again&s;t Sprigg, the owner, was, that a day before the &s;hip put to &s;ea he bought an auger which was an inch and an half wide in the bore; that the &s;hip had augers enough before, and that there was no manner of occa&s;ion for &s;o wide an auger; and that he was under the deck all the time the &s;ailors were pumping, and, as they believed, boring the &s;hip.</P>
<P>"But THE EVIDENCE BEING ONLY PRESUMPTIVE again&s;t both the defendants, they were acquitted."&mdash;</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have cited the&s;e ca&s;es to &s;how you, how little regard is paid to evidence of this kind in capital ca&s;es; and that the lives of men are not to be &s;ported with upon mere pre&s;umptions; and altho' the evidence in tho&s;e ca&s;es were &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy almo&s;t any mind, yet being in the ca&s;e of life, with an humane and wi&s;e caution, it was thought proper to acquit the defendants. Thus you &s;ee, gentlemen, what the rule is, and ought to be in tho&s;e ca&s;es; and if you &s;hould even err in acquitting the pri&s;oners, it is told to us, that it is &s;afer and better to err on the &s;ide of mercy, than on the &s;ide of ju&s;tice; it is &s;afer to err in acquitting than in puni&s;hing. 2. Hale. 290. Weigh well, therefore, every thing you have heard; and if you &s;hall find the evidence &s;uch as we &s;hall endeavour to &s;how it to be, uncertain, un&s;atisfactory, inconclu&s;ive, let your judgments di&s;|card it upon this awful occa&s;ion; for you, gentlemen, are bound to take notice of the rules of evidence, as well as of the evidence it&s;elf; and if you apply tho&s;e rules to the evidence before you, we can be under no apprehen&s;ions for the fate of our clients.</P>
<P>Innocence, gentlemen, is as bold as a lion. Con&s;cious of their innocence, the two pri&s;oners dread not the &s;evere&s;t inve&s;tigation; but re&s;t with confi|dence that they will be re&s;tored to their liberty by the verdict of a con&s;cien|tious and impartial jury.</P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, let me con&s;ider the effect of the evidence as it is detail|ed again&s;t Patrick Donagan. The WIEDERKOMME DROPS &s;eem to be an important link in the chain.

I expected to have had it &s;hown, from the opening, that the WIEDER|KOMME DROPS were a deadly poi&s;on; but no &s;uch thing has been attempt|ed, nor any account given of what they are, or how they are compo&s;ed: on the other hand, we find both Hauer and Peter Shitz drinking of them, and that no ill con&s;equence ever followed from it. But it is not hard to con|jecture what was the object of them; it has been the fa&s;hion of late to de|&s;ire to grow rich by the aid of &s;pirits, and the&s;e unknown drops were to ope|rate as a charm or &s;pell to conjure up &s;ome gho&s;t, and to unlock the wealth that is &s;ecretly buried in the earth. We have had of late &s;everal in&s;tances of this; and de&s;igning and artful men, for the purpo&s;es of gain to them&s;elves, have had the addre&s;s to induce a &s;trong belief of this power, and to impo&s;e upon many credulous men. Patrick Donagan him&s;elf, though he does not want under&s;tanding, appears to have been under this influence. Why el&s;e would he take &s;uch pains to procure drops, unle&s;s he &s;uppo&s;ed they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome peculiar power, and were famous for rai&s;ing gho&s;ts? The very diffi|culty in procuring them, mu&s;t have &s;trengthened the opinion, and the ap|parent reluctance to part with them for large &s;ums, mu&s;t naturally have in|crea&s;ed his belief, as well as his anxiety to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch a trea&s;ure. It never could be for the purpo&s;e of poi&s;on. He would not be &s;uch a fool as to offer &s;uch a price as &pound;.50 for a gill, for the mere purpo&s;e of poi&s;oning; when for Expence he might have procured as much ARSENIC as would have de&s;troy|ed half a dozen lives. Be&s;ides, gentlemen, he would have been more ap|prehen&s;ive of a di&s;covery, and more cautions in his enquiries, if he had in|tended any harm. He never would have been &s;o public in his &s;earch for it, and have thus opened the door for evidence again&s;t him, in ca&s;e mi&s;chief had followed. He affects no &s;ecrecy, lays no injunctions upon any of the doc|tors. Dr. Stau&s;e him&s;elf &s;eems to have no conjecture that any thing impro|per was intended; he even jokes upon the &s;ubject, and tells Patrick that he &s;uppo&s;ed he wanted to try projects with the&s;e drops&mdash;that Patrick &s;miled, pro|bably at the &s;hrewdne&s;s of the conjecture, and &s;aid, yes.&mdash;Gentlemen, we never find Donagan affecting the lea&s;t &s;ecrecy in his &s;earches after the&s;e drops. When he went to Dr. Koenigmacher he went in company with Tammany, who is proved to you to be a man of reputation. Nor is it greatly to be wondered at, gentlemen, that Patrick Donagan &s;hould be impre&s;&s;ed with an opinion of the power of this medicine to rai&s;e up &s;pirits; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e had heard it, probably, much talked of, and he was anxious to try the experiment.

We read of very great men who have been under the &s;ame delu&s;ion, if it is a de|lu&s;ion; and even Sir Mathew Hale and Dr. John&s;ton firmly believed in the exi&s;t|ence of witches and witchcraft.&mdash;There may be &s;omething in the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome men, which may render them more peculiarly liable to &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions than others.&mdash;Be this as it may, it &s;eems to us that this kind of evidence is too frivolous to be relied upon to affect the lives of the pri|&s;oners upon &s;o &s;erious a charge as the pre&s;ent. I will examine whether the other circum&s;tances are entitled to more weight.&mdash;</P>
<P>Gentlemen, is it any proof of a con&s;piracy that Donagan lived in the hou&s;e of Hauer? Mu&s;t a man nece&s;&s;arily &s;hare the guilt of the per&s;on in who&s;e hou&s;e he lives? or is he liable to the mi&s;conduct of his landlord? How can he, upon any principle of rea&s;on, be pre&s;umed to have a know|ledge of all his plots and con&s;piracies, all his wicked intentions, from the mere circum&s;tance of his living in his hou&s;e, without other proof? Think how dangerous a doctrine this would be! Patrick Donagan is a &s;ingle man; he mu&s;t have his home &s;omewhere. But if it &s;hould unfortunately turn out that his landlord has been guilty of murder, he mu&s;t al&s;o &s;hare the guilt of his landlord, and be liable to all the di&s;graceful con&s;equences from the mere circum&s;tance of his living under the &s;ame roof. This is too ab&s;urd to rea&s;on upon. But he has been &s;een to ride backwards and forwards with John Hauer. Is there any thing very extraordinary in this? on the other hand, is there any thing more common than that an inmate &s;hould a&s;&s;ociate with his landlord? will this admit of any conclu&s;ion to affect the innocence of Donagan? if it will, it will be dangerous ever to have been &s;een in com|pany with a man, who, as it may afterwards appear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">is an abandoned vil|lain. But, gentlemen, from &s;uch premi&s;es, no conclu&s;ion will follow.&mdash;</P>
<P>But the purcha&s;e of the powder is next re&s;orted to, as a circum&s;tance of mighty weight in the ca&s;e of Patrick Donagan. We, on our part, can conceive nothing more frivolous and inconclu&s;ive. It was not until two weeks after the murder that this was ever thought of at all. It is now brought in, with a view that many little circum&s;tances taken together, trivial and in&s;ignificant in them&s;elves, &s;hould appear to form a great ma&s;s of proof. But we may ea&s;ily perceive, that even all tho&s;e little circum&s;tances actually &s;tand &s;eparate and unconnected with each other, proving nothing; carrying

no conviction to the mind&mdash;Becau&s;e Mr. Kapp makes bags of paper re|&s;embling the one produced to you, though he cannot expre&s;sly &s;wear that either the paper or the powder is the &s;ame which he made and &s;old, you are to &s;uppo&s;e it to be the &s;ame, and to pre&s;ume that no other man can fold an half &s;heet of paper in the &s;ame &s;hape. Becau&s;e he procures his paper all from one manufacturer; admitting it to be the &s;ame &s;ort, you are to pre&s;ume no other &s;torekeeper procures paper from the &s;ame man. Becau&s;e he purcha&s;es powder from Dubs and Marquedaunt, and the grains of that in the papers &s;hown have a re&s;emblance, you are to &s;uppo&s;e he purcha&s;ed it of Kapp, though even Mr. Kapp admits that &s;torekeepers about Lebanon al&s;o purcha&s;e powder from Dubs and Marquedaunt. Becau&s;e Patrick Don|agan, who was accu&s;tomed to quarry &s;tones, purcha&s;ed a &s;mall quantity of powder two months before the murder, which he might have wanted, and have u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of a bla&s;t, you are to &s;uppo&s;e this bag to be the &s;ame, and this powder the &s;ame, and that no one el&s;e could have purcha&s;ed &s;uch a paper of powder either of Kapp or any other &s;torekeeper. I &s;ay, you mu&s;t of force rai&s;e all the&s;e hard pre&s;umptions, or the whole argument built upon this poor circum&s;tance, on the part of the Commonwealth, mu&s;t fall to the ground. For if you do not at once pre&s;ume the whole of them, then it becomes the mo&s;t inconclu&s;ive, uncertain and un&s;atisfactory proof in nature.</P>
<P>Of a piece with the affair of the powder, is the circum&s;tance of his being at the hou&s;e of Logan, when M'Manus was there with the pi&s;tols. What does this prove? what u&s;e can be made of it? If you apply it at all, the argument will prove too much. What was his conduct there? He was peaceable; he did not a&s;&s;i&s;t M'Manus in his oppo&s;ition; nor did he appear to have any thing to do with him. After the oppo&s;ition had re&s;ted, and M'Manus was convinced that Miller was not then acting as a con&s;table, they became friends again; they drank together. Miller has told us, that he had been in company with M'Manus before, at a tavern, drinking, but he thought no harm of it. But if this is evidence of a con&s;piracy, or a participation in the guilt of M'Manus, why not al&s;o indict Miller and Logan? They are equally involved in this kind of guilt. In &s;hort, gentlemen, &s;uch a number of &s;trange, trifling and incoherent circum&s;tances never before were collected together to &s;upport a charge of this magnitude, and of &s;uch &s;erious con&s;e|quence.

<P>It is further attempted to rai&s;e a &s;u&s;picion from the circum&s;tance of his going to George Illig's. Had he been at Hauer's they would have made it a plan to hang him. They would &s;till hang him though he was ten miles off on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> night.&mdash;This is reducing poor Patrick to a mi&s;erable di&s;em|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">. Let him be where he would, he mu&s;t not e&s;cape.&mdash;We, gentlemen, con&s;ider this as a &s;triking circum&s;tance in his favour. He appears to have had no connection with the perpetrators of this murder; not to have known any thing of the dreadful &s;cene that was at that moment about to be acted. He was at a di&s;tance from the place; at the hou&s;e of a reputable indepen|dent man, who is here, and has te&s;tified in his favour. He &s;taid there all night. It was not a trifling excu&s;e that carried him there. He had an account to &s;ettle with Mr. Illig, for quarrying &s;tone; he had al&s;o money depo&s;ited in his hands, to a con&s;iderable amount. He had often &s;lept there before; he was well known, and well thought of in the neighbourhood.&mdash;In the morning he appeared as unconcerned as u&s;ual; no marks of a di&s;turbed and guilty mind. He accordingly &s;at down and was writing a letter to Ireland, when the me&s;&s;enger came for him. So &s;udden a &s;ummons upon &s;o awful an occa&s;ion, would naturally &s;trike an immediate alarm; my God, &s;aid Patrick, can it be po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;He did not he&s;itate to obey the &s;ummons. He was not unwilling to undergo the &s;tricte&s;t examination. He a&s;ked Mr. Illig for a few lines to certify that he was at his hou&s;e all night. So per|&s;uaded was Mr. Illig of his innocence, that he went up with him to Shae|fer's town, where he was immediately di&s;charged. In all this we can|not di&s;cover a &s;ingle TRAIT of guilt.&mdash;</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation in the gaol is the la&s;t circum&s;tance brought again&s;t him. Certainly what Cox declared can be no evidence again&s;t Donagan, for Do|nagan expre&s;sly denies his knowledge of any &s;ecrets, and put him to his de|fiance to di&s;clo&s;e it. He was indifferent to any thing he could &s;ay, if he only a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the truth. If then this could po&s;&s;ibly have any operation, it can have an operation only again&s;t Cox him&s;elf. But they appear to have been ha&s;ty expre&s;&s;ions, in the heat of liquor, without any meaning. We cannot,
<PB N="95" REF="034040_0096_0FFA4B7B252C0D60">
however, conjecture what they referred to. It is more than probable, that if Cox had any knowledge of criminal matters to affect Donagan, in the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his rage, he would have given it vent. Be that as it may; it certainly can have no relation to the matter now before the Court. For you will ob&s;erve, gentlemen, that Cox charges him with knocking &s;ouls out with axes; it could not therefore be the &s;ecret of this murder. Donagan is not charged as a principal in the murder. It is not pretended that he was pre&s;ent in the hou&s;e of Francis Shitz, or that he was one of tho&s;e who &s;truck Francis on the head with the axe. On the contrary it is evident he was not there. Whatever this may have meant, therefore, you mu&s;t di&s;mi&s;s the circum&s;tance from your minds, as affecting the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, both as to Donagan and Cox. Gentlemen, there is a &s;trong mark of the innocence of Patrick Donagan: When he was di&s;charged from the fir&s;t examination at Shaefer's town, he &s;till continued in the neighborhood. He was taken up a &s;econd time and di&s;|charged. He &s;till remained, re&s;ting upon the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his innocence. It was not till three weeks after the murder that he was committed to pri&s;on. Had he been guilty, he had ample time to make his e&s;cape; and his flight would have been a &s;trong pre&s;umption of his guilt. But he was not afraid to &s;ubmit to a trial by the laws of this country; well knowing that no evi|dence of guilt could ever be brought to affect the good character he has hi|therto &s;upported. He is now upon that trial, waiting with awful anxiety for the verdict you &s;hall deliver.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider, gentlemen, whether the evidence again&s;t Cox is intitled to more weight than that again&s;t Donagan. There is not one wit|ne&s;s who can &s;ay that he ever &s;aw him in the neighborhood, or near the hou&s;e of Francis Shitz; or that he had ever been in company with, or had any knowledge of John Hauer: they were utter &s;trangers to each other. The whole &s;trength of the evidence again&s;t him is founded on the conver&s;ation at Manheim. No circum&s;tance appears from that to induce a belief that he was privy to what was pa&s;&s;ing re&s;pecting the murder of Shitz. Nothing, from any thing that appears, was di&s;clo&s;ed to Cox at Manheim. Cox him|&s;elf was deceived, and M'Manus played this trick upon him. We find from the evidence of Caffry, that M'Manus would not tell what object he had in view, only that he &s;hould receive no harm. And when Caffry a&s;ked Cox the next day, Cox declared he did not know what it was M'Manus
<PB N="96" REF="034040_0097_0FFA4B7DA1AAED50">
wanted with them. It is too &s;trong a conjecture, then, to &s;uppo&s;e that Cox was at all acquainted with the dete&s;table plan of M'Manus. There is no ground even for a probable pre&s;umption; and in the ca&s;e of life, it ought to be violent. We &s;hall &s;ee by and by, whether any part of his conduct at Geiger's, demon&s;trates that he knew any thing of the intention of Charles M'Manus. From the te&s;timony of Caffry, it was impo&s;&s;ible that Cox could have heard the conver&s;ation between Caffry and M'Manus. He was walk|ing before, a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, with Bretz, in a loud conver&s;ation, while M'Manus and Caffry were walking behind, and talking extremely low; it was a matter between Caffry and M'Manus, with which Cox had no con|nection. But his going to the hou&s;e of Geiger, on the night of the murder, is looked upon as a circum&s;tance of great moment. We apprehend there is the &s;ame uncertainty in that as in all the other circum&s;tances. From his conduct at the hou&s;e nothing can be gathered which ought, with rea&s;onable men, to induce a conviction. The going to bed a little before 8 o'clock, proves nothing; neither is it, e&s;pecially after the fatigues of travelling, an unu&s;ual hour. How can we fairly judge that Cox knew any thing of M'Manus's de&s;igns, from any thing that took place? On the other hand, is it not more rea&s;onable: to &s;uppo&s;e, from a fair con&s;truction of the evidence, that he did not know any thing of it? As to his refu&s;al to hunt for him; that may be well accounted for from what you have heard;&mdash;he may, and actually mu&s;t have &s;uppo&s;ed that he had gone after the girls, and that it would an&s;wer no purpo&s;e to &s;earch for him. This accounts for his indifference. He had no idea that he was frozen to death, or in the lea&s;t danger from the cold. If, gentlemen, there had been a formed de&s;ign, how ea&s;y would it have been to have &s;lipped M'Manus out of the chamber window, and not let him go down &s;tairs with a probability of his being di&s;covered, when the de&s;ign in &s;uch ca&s;e would have been to keep his departure from the hou&s;e, in the night, an entire &s;ecret. Neither would Cox have been &s;o unguarded, if he had known what M'Manus had been about, as to have let him into the hou&s;e in the pre&s;ence and hearing of the Geigers.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, many parts of the evidence might be treated with de&s;erved ridicule, but the &s;olemnity of this day, (for the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e has obliged us to break in upon the Sabbath) forbids my having recour&s;e to any kind of argument that would have the appearance of levity.

For we hold it to be a &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition, &s;ounded in rea&s;on, and in a peculiar manner inforced and con&s;ecrated by our laws, which makes it the principle of your oath of office, to try according to your evidence: that to convict the&s;e men of the offence with which they &s;tand charged on any other ground than the evidence you have had laid before you here on oath, would, in the fight of God and man, be nothing &s;hort of judicial murder,

The cau&s;e of it, the emphatic, the alarming cau&s;e, which makes it our duty to declare it with all our powers, and your duty to hear it with your be&s;t attention, is the ca|lumny which the bu&s;y babbling tongue of lying rumour has created and given to "the bandy wind which hi&s;&s;es all it meets," to carry, not only into the &s;treets and along the highways, but into every hou&s;e and corner, nay into the very ears of every man in the county of Dauphin.

As the evidence again&s;t the two pri&s;oners is

e&s;&s;entially different, it becomes a matter of nece&s;&s;ity, to con&s;ider their ca&s;es &s;eparately, as far as the te&s;timony divides it&s;elf. My colleagues having fir&s;t con&s;idered the ca&s;e of Patrick Donagan, I &s;hall take the liberty of fir&s;t a&s;k|ing your attention to the charge again&s;t Francis Cox. The evidence of his guilt is alleged to ari&s;e out of his conduct at Manheim&mdash;at the hou&s;e of Geiger, and in pri&s;on. The jury will readily perceive the difficulty the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oners are &s;ubjected to in the pre&s;ent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, as the gen|tlemen concerned for the pro&s;ecution have declined (though recommended to them by the court) to &s;peak alternately; by which the huge ma&s;s of proof is thrown before us without arrangement, comment or application. This awkward &s;ituation will, I hope, in &s;ome degree, furni&s;h an apology for the want of that order and pertinency which I fear will appear &s;o vi&s;ible in the ob&s;er|vations it falls to me to make. I will fir&s;t endeavor to &s;how that there is no evidence, much le&s;s manife&s;t evidence, to prove that Cox heard and under&s;tood what pa&s;&s;ed between M'Manus and Caffry, and of cour&s;e that he was not privy to M'Manus's de&s;igns; and &s;econdly, &s;uppo&s;ing, tho' not admitting, that if he did hear and under&s;tand every word of it, though it might furni&s;h grounds for doubt and conjecture, yet it would not amount to the proof required by law to convict the pri&s;oner. The circum&s;tances which will probably be relied on as di&s;clo&s;ed at Manheim, as evincing Francis Cox's knowledge of M'Manus's propo&s;al and de&s;igns, are, that they were acquaint|ed&mdash;that Cox fir&s;t applied to Caffry&mdash;that he probably heard it when made to Caffry&mdash;and that Cox a day or two after a&s;ked Caffry if he would do what they or we (the witne&s;s don't recollect which expre&s;&s;ion) were talking about before. That Cox was acquainted with M'Manus, as men in their &s;ituation in life, who live in the &s;ame neighborhood, and particularly in &s;mall villages, &s;uch as Manheim is; can be no ground of &s;urpri&s;e or appre|hen&s;ion. But its intended weight in the pre&s;ent inquiry, mu&s;t be by way of introduction, to give a &s;ort of colouring to the other &s;lender circum&s;tances urged in this cau&s;e, as evidencing in this poor fellow, "a heart regardle&s;s of &s;ocial duty and fatally bent upon mi&s;chief."</P>

Could Cox have apprehended any harm, to re&s;ult from what he &s;poke of thus openly, thus publicly, and in ca&s;e it was evil, thus unguard|edly?

to plan and execute&mdash;when he comes to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound Caffry and to gain his agency he embraces the un&s;u&s;picious opportunity of their walking from the Ju&s;tice's&mdash;&s;eparates him to him&s;elf&mdash;makes the propo&s;al, and conver&s;es on the &s;ubject in that low tone of voice, calculated to exclude all hearing and under|&s;tanding of what they were talking about, by Bretz and Cox who were be|fore. Here then you have a plain line of di&s;tinction between the conduct of a man who had plans and de&s;igns of evil to effect, and a man who had none, acting from the impul&s;e of the moment. The one is artful, covered and de&s;igning, the other is blunt, open and indifferent. Notwith&s;tanding the evidence for the pro&s;ecution has proved that the propo&s;al of M'Manus to Caffry was made to him when they were walking by them&s;elves, at lea&s;t a rod behind Bretz and Cox&mdash;that it was &s;poken in a low tone of voice, evi|dently de&s;igned to exclude Bretz and Cox from hearing&mdash;that at the time it was &s;poken Bretz and Cox were talking as loud as people u&s;ually do in di&s;cour&s;e with each other&mdash;I &s;ay notwith&s;tanding all this, added to the other evidence which I have pointed out, of Cox not being let into the &s;ecret by M'Manus, will it &s;till be contended that it is probable, nay more, that it is e|ven po&s;&s;ible, that it was not only heard by Cox but &s;o heard as to be under|&s;tood by him? And &s;urely the expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed by Cox, a day or two after, to Caffry, when he a&s;ked him if he would do what they or we were talking about before, gives no aid to the extravagant &s;uppo&s;ition of Cox having heard and under&s;tood what was &s;aid by M'Manus. In the fir&s;t place, the expre&s;|&s;ion is &s;o equivocal as to leave its import a matter of doubt and conjecture, on which ground this jury is bound to refu&s;e it any weight again&s;t the life of this man. In the &s;econd place taking it in its &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e again&s;t him (in which &s;en&s;e I contend it cannot legally be taken) it only implies that he tho't he knew what they had been talking about, but in what way he got his in|formation by over hearing them, or by M'Manus's telling him &s;omething, but what that &s;omething was, whether that he was going to kill the Shitz's or, what is far more likely, that he was going to run away with &s;ome rich heire&s;s, is left utterly in the dark. In the third place we contend it related to &s;ome fooli&s;h &s;tory which the art of M'Manus had impo&s;ed on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> credulity of Cox, which he &s;uppo&s;ed he had mentioned to Caffry, in which ca&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion "we were talking of before" would be exactly appropriat|ed. But fourthly, this equivocal expre&s;&s;ion and the propo&s;ition it was brought forward to &s;upport, is not left to re&s;t upon con&s;truction, for we have the ex|pre&s;s

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the man him&s;elf (and all he &s;aid mu&s;t be taken together) in an&s;wer to the que&s;tion put to him by Caffry, if he knew what it was&mdash;that he did not.</P>
<P>The fair re&s;ult of this examination of the te&s;timony at Manheim, I &s;ubmit with confidence to you, is, that it is not proved that Francis Cox was privy to, or knew of the evil de&s;igns of M'Manus, or that he heard and under&s;tood what pa&s;&s;ed between M'Manus and Caffry; but that, as far as a fair con|&s;truction of their words and actions, which are the only grounds from which you can judge, go, we are warranted to &s;ay, he did not know his de&s;igns and intentions, and that he did not hear and under&s;tand what pa&s;&s;ed between M'Manus and Caffry. But &s;uppo&s;ing, though not admitting, that it was in full proof, that Cox was &s;tanding by and di&s;tinctly heard and under&s;tood every thing which pa&s;&s;ed between M'Manus and Caffry, I would contend with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion before this Court and Jury, that it does not amount to proof of any evil intention imputable to Cox, and much le&s;s any imputation of participating in the perpetration of that inhuman and murd'rous crime with which he &s;tands charged. Here then at once to reveal the nothingne&s;s of this propo&s;ition which the gentlemen con&s;ider as all in all in the evidence they have offered; it &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tes no object; it makes known no &s;cheme; it pro|po&s;es no end to be effected; a whi&s;per of murder is not heard in it; a hint of any &s;pecific crime is not to be gathered from it; but, on the con|trary, it is accompanied with an expre&s;s declaration, in an&s;wer to Caffry's enquiry, in the language of the witne&s;s, that "it would not hurt him at all." It is true it is accompanied with the common mummery of impo&s;ition, a refu&s;al to tell till the oath of &s;ecrecy was impo&s;ed and that they were then to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">allow in wealth by which the artful and de&s;igning in all ages and all coun|tries fir&s;t excite the vacant curio&s;ity, and then pervert the folly, weakne&s;s and credulity of mankind, to &s;erve their fraudulent and many times their wicked and bloody purpo&s;es. Permit me to a&s;k any of you, if you had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this propo&s;al made before this bloody tragedy was acted, if you would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;covered from it that &s;cent for human blood, with which it is now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to be &s;o rank, &s;ince the horrid fact has happened? Surely not. In the wide field of conjecture you would in all probability have con&s;idered it as an attempt at &s;ome impo&s;ture to acquire gain, which would be ridiculous in the eyes of every one but tho&s;e who were impo&s;ing, or impo&s;ed on, by
<PB N="105" REF="034040_0106_0FFA4BAE22E36198">
it:&mdash;That it was a &s;cheme of wilful murder, would be the la&s;t &s;u&s;picion which would have entered the heart of any man who&s;e wonted meals were not &s;erved with human blood.</P>
<P>Remember, gentlemen, I now &s;peak of what you would have thought of this propo&s;ition at the time it was made, when the peaceful &s;ecurity of Fran|cis Shitz's hou&s;e had not been violated; when midnight repo&s;e had not in|vited murder; when innocent blood had not been unprovokedly, inhuman|ly and mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly &s;pilt: In &s;hort, gentlemen, at a time when you were fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of your&s;elves, cool in your deliberations and unbia&s;&s;ed in your judgments. How then can you impute to this man a knowledge of M'Ma|nus's intention to commit this crime, from a propo&s;ition which in it&s;elf contains no intimation, expre&s;s or implied, that any &s;uch crime was to be committed? To do &s;o, would be to convict, not only without violent, with|out manife&s;t proof, which the law enjoins you to require; but without any proof what&s;oever. I therefore conclude on this head that if Francis Cox heard and fully under&s;tood what M'Manus &s;aid to Caffry, (which is the ut|mo&s;t the gentlemen can contend for), that it would furni&s;h no rational ground to believe that Cox was privy to and knew of the de&s;igns of M'Manus, much le&s;s would it furni&s;h that violent pre&s;umption, that manife&s;t proof, which cannot be contradicted and which it is your bounden duty to require. Permit me now to pa&s;s from this ground work of the charge to the fir&s;t &s;tage in the &s;uper&s;tructure which is attempted to be rai&s;ed upon it, and enquire whether there is not the &s;ame want of proof; the &s;ame pre&s;umptive evidence of Cox being the dupe of M'Manus; and the &s;ame doubt and conjecture hanging round the evidence taken in its greate&s;t latitude, again&s;t the pri&s;oner. Cox went with M'Manus to Geiger's the day before the murder was committed, and &s;lept there that night. This I confe&s;s is a main and connecting link in the chain of the evidence, and if it had been preceded by plain and man|ife&s;t proof, which could not have been doubted or contradicted, of Cox being privy to the de&s;igns of M'Manus, and followed by like plain and manife&s;t indications of Cox endeavoring to conceal the de&s;igns, and cover the con|duct of M'Manus from detection, it would have furni&s;hed &s;trong grounds to call upon the jury for their mo&s;t &s;erious and &s;olemn con&s;ideration, to &s;ay whether they did not amount to that violent pre&s;umption, that manife&s;t proof, which would ju&s;tify them in taking away his life. But dive&s;ted of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e e&s;|&s;ential
<PB N="106" REF="034040_0107_0FFA4BAFDCBDFC88">
ingredients it is reconcileable in Cox's total ignorance of M'Manus's de&s;igns, and in its &s;tronge&s;t application again&s;t the pri&s;oner, terminates in that wide field of doubt, conjecture and uncertainty, that no humane man would con&s;ider him&s;elf exempt from the imputation of cruelty, were he to de&s;troy, on the &s;trength of it, the life of a &s;parrow, let alone that of a fellow creature. Indeed, &s;lender as it is in it&s;elf, it is attended with circum&s;tances which derogate from its weight. M'Manus had worked and was acquainted in that neighbourhood; had previou&s;ly borrowed Geiger's &s;addle, and had the plau&s;ible pretext of returning it, to hold out to Cox, to di&s;gui&s;e his real object, at the &s;ame time that he wrought on his ea&s;y credulity or compani|onable di&s;po&s;ition to accompany him. When they were there in a way &s;o early accounted for from the circum&s;tances, to hear the witne&s;&s;es detail|ing with &s;o much empha&s;is, that M'Manus got his boots drawn and left them down &s;tairs&mdash;though the landlord offered &s;lippers without being a&s;ked for them; that Cox went up to bed with his &s;hoes on, though the witne&s;s tells you on his cro&s;s examination, that he never gives &s;lippers to men with &s;hoes, that they went to bed &s;o early, though it was ju&s;t eight o'clock, and the other travellers went about five minutes after, that they &s;lept together&mdash;though it was expre&s;&s;ly enjoined by the landlord: no di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate man can wink &s;o hard as not to &s;ee that they are &s;peaking from their feelings and not from that cool recollection, and unbia&s;&s;ed judgment, which ought to influence them.&mdash;</P>
<P>This will readily excu&s;e me to you for pa&s;&s;ing over unnoticed a great deal of that very little matter which fell from the witne&s;&s;es and coming to the few circum&s;tances which can be pretended to influence this cau&s;e. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t of M'Manus's taking Cox's handkerchief and &s;hoes, of Cox's conduct on the different occa&s;ions he was applied to by Geiger&mdash;his pretending to &s;earch in the language of the witne&s;&s;es, when he did get up, and his conduct when M'|Manus returned. As to M'Manus having taken the handkerchief and &s;hoes, there is no evidence to &s;how Cox con&s;ented to, or ever knew of his having taken the &s;hoes (and the taking of the handkerchief he told him&s;elf,) without which it cannot a&s;&s;ume even the &s;hadow of te&s;timony: and if it had appeared he did con&s;ent to his taking them, there could be no crime in it, without he al&s;o knew what was his intentions in taking them. So that, for you to give any weight to this circum&s;tance, you mu&s;t pre&s;ume without any proof of it, that he did con&s;ent to his taking them, and that he knew what they were
<PB N="107" REF="034040_0108_0FFA16D2E8CE3290">
taken for, directly contrary to that pre&s;umption the law and humanity make it your &s;acred duty to make, in favor of the innocence of the pri&s;oner. But we are told that his indifference on the fir&s;t enquiry of Geiger re&s;pecting M'Manus, and his backwardne&s;s in getting up when repeatedly &s;poken to by him, with his pretending to hunt when he did get up, all &s;how him privy to M'Manus's de&s;igns, and that he knew where he was&mdash;that while every one el&s;e was agitated and alarmed, he was calm and indifferent. I agree, that as the tree is known by its fruit, it is a fair rule where a man's actions are unequivocal, to judge of his conduct by them. On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, I utterly deny that the action of Francis Cox, which are relied on as coin|ciding with the &s;entiments of his mind, are of that kind which authorize any unbia&s;&s;ed man in making the conclu&s;ion the&s;e witne&s;&s;es do. In the fir&s;t place, they do not &s;peak a direct, plain and manife&s;t language, which they ought to do to warrant an inference &s;o highly penal; but on the contrary, taken in their &s;tronge&s;t light, depend on &s;uch a variety of circum&s;tances, that their re|&s;ult mu&s;t be the &s;ubject of doubt, conjecture and uncertainty.</P>
<P>When Geiger fir&s;t went up to &s;ee if M'Manus had returned to bed, he found Cox awake who, on his enquiring, told him what M'Manus &s;aid was the occa&s;ion of his going out. In this, then, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ere was &s;urely no ground of &s;u&s;picion; but the contrary, as Cox, who, on the gentleman's principles, would have been very deeply intere&s;ted in making it be believed, that he was a&s;leep, when M'Manus went out, affects no di&s;gui&s;e, does not, in the language of the witne&s;s, pretend to be a&s;leep, though it might have been done without &s;u&s;picion, but tells him he had taken his handkerchief. After Geiger had been again &s;ent out by his wife&mdash;had hunted without effect&mdash;he returns, goes up to Cox again, who, he &s;ays, pretended then to be a&s;leep, wakes him, and tells him he wants him to get up and help to hunt, which Cox refu&s;es, &s;aying he &s;uppo&s;ed M'Manus had gone after the girls. Why &s;hould Cox now pretend to be a&s;leep, when it could an&s;wer him no purpo&s;e, after he was awake the fir&s;t time, when his pretending to be a&s;leep and impo&s;ing that di&s;gui&s;e on Geiger, would have been all in all to him? He had walked and rode alternately from Manheim that day&mdash;it was at lea&s;t, if not pa&s;t the u&s;ual hour of &s;leeping&mdash;a con&s;iderable interval mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been &s;pent by Geiger in hunting, added to the want of motive to pretend &s;leep, fully e&s;ta|bli&s;hes a &s;trong probability that he was actually &s;leeping, and that Geiger's
<PB N="108" REF="034040_0109_0FFA4BB3A0B8E460">
&s;u&s;picion that he was pretending, was conjured up by his own alarmed and frightened feelings. As to his not getting up, and the &s;uppo&s;ition he made as to M'Manus's ab&s;ence, they appear to me to be the re&s;ult of his &s;itua|tion, fatigued and &s;leepy, and a firmne&s;s of mind, not liable to be alarmed with the &s;tranger's &s;tory of a young Iri&s;hman, full of fle&s;h and blood, being frozen in a neighborhood, thickly &s;ettled, in which he was well known. He mu&s;t have been a &s;trange compound of weakne&s;s and credulity, who, not appri&s;ed of M'Manus's de&s;igns, could in Cox's &s;ituation have been in|duced to comply with Geiger's reque&s;t. But it is alleged, that after the third hunt&mdash;after he had alarmed the neighbors, when Geiger rou&s;ed the Jer&s;ey|men, and was about leaving one of them to watch Cox, that he got up, went out with them and pretended to &s;earch, but was not in earne&s;t. From the account Geiger and wife have given of their own feelings, it is apparent that every one who DID not feel and act like them, would appear to their agitat|ed minds, to be pretending not to be in earne&s;t; becau&s;e Cox is indifferent, cool and compo&s;ed, they conclude him criminal&mdash;becau&s;e he is not agitated, forward and bu&s;tling in the &s;earch, they &s;uppo&s;e him pretending: and it is the&s;e apprehen&s;ions and appearances they have been giving you for evidence, in the place of what you ought to have had laid before you, the undi&s;gui&s;ed facts, and the cool, unbia&s;&s;ed ob&s;ervations made on the facts at the time. That Cox did not act that part, we readily admit; but that he acted under any di&s;gui&s;e, we deny to be a fair deduction from his conduct, taken in parts or collectively. One would have &s;uppo&s;ed, that when Cox found M'Manus out at the door, and came down and opened the door in which Geiger and wife, and the Jer&s;eymen were, and told them M'Manus was &s;tanding out &s;ide wanting to come in, that even the hot &s;cent the&s;e witne&s;&s;es had, would not have been able to di&s;cover any evidence of guilt in it, and yet it is a made a main prop of this pro&s;ecution, that when Cox opened the door after this, that no one &s;aw M'Manus, as they went &s;traight up to bed. And why did they not one and all of them &s;ee him? Was it Cox's fault? Or did they &s;uppo&s;e, when Cox threw open the door, informed them M'Manus was at the outer door, and thus gave them an opportunity of meeting him, &s;eeing and in&s;pecting him, that he was only pretending, and that he was not in earne&s;t? It would &s;urely have been a very Iri&s;h way of pretending.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="034040_0110_0FFA4BB8E6A53810">
But I contend that the whole of Francis Cox's conduct at Geiger's, on fair con&s;truction of it, &s;peaks a language directly the rever&s;e of that which the witne&s;&s;es and the pro&s;ecution impute to it. That in&s;tead of its evidencing a knowledge in Cox of M'Manus's bloody intentions, and that he was then gone to carry them into execution, it &s;hows, as far as it proves any thing, that Cox was totally ignorant of M'Manus's de&s;igns; that he was duped by him, and that he had no apprehen&s;ions that any evil was tran&s;acting. If Cox had been really an accomplice with M'Manus, his fir&s;t object would have been to have watched the feelings, and acted up to the wi&s;hes of Geiger and his wife, in all his movements, as the &s;ure&s;t means of avoiding their &s;u&s;picion, and working out his own &s;afety, at lea&s;t, if not that of his companion. He would have been put immediately on his guard, by the open di&s;covery made by Geiger and his wife of M'Manus, when he went out, and which Cox mu&s;t have been fully appri&s;ed of, as the conver&s;ation which took place, was continued and loud on the part of Geiger and his wife, within hearing. He would therefore have been fully prepared to have acted his part in the &s;cenes which took place between him and Geiger, by being a&s;leep, in&s;tead of being awake, when Geiger came fir&s;t up&mdash;by feeling as Geiger felt, in&s;tead of &s;howing that indifference he di&s;covered on being told of the alarm&mdash;by &s;howing that ready forwardne&s;s which Geiger's per|turbation &s;ugge&s;ted, in&s;tead of that cold refu&s;al with which he met the pre&s;&s;ing intreaties of Geiger&mdash;by hunting with that bu&s;tling activity and zeal, which would have gone hand in hand with Geiger, in&s;tead of doing it in that &s;aun|tering carele&s;s way, which led Geiger to think he was pretending&mdash;that he was not in earne&s;t&mdash;by carefully remaining up with them in the hou&s;e after the &s;earch was given over, watching their movements, and keeping pace with their &s;entiments, in&s;tead of cro&s;&s;ing them in their conjectures, &s;lighting them in their anxieties&mdash;returning to bed with his wonted unconcern, leaving them to brood over their own unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;traction, to his almo&s;t uncer|tain ruin as well as that of his companion. To me it appears impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile Cox's conduct in being awake&mdash;in recogni&s;ing M'Manus going out&mdash;in telling about the handkerchief and not of the &s;hoes&mdash;in being &s;o indifferent&mdash;in refu&s;ing to ri&s;e&mdash;in being &s;o at cro&s;s purpo&s;es with the feelings of Geiger, to the plaine&s;t principles of common &s;en&s;e, if you &s;uppo&s;e him to be privy to the de&s;igns of M'Manus, whereas, in &s;uppo&s;ing him the dupe and tool of M'Manus, ignorant of his intentions, his conduct is the natural re&s;ult of
<PB N="110" REF="034040_0111_0FFA4BBA72488B18">
his &s;ituation, his want of motives, his openne&s;s and his firmne&s;s of character, which would call for no concealment, could &s;tand in need of no di&s;|gui&s;e. At the time that I contend and hope I have &s;hown, that Cox's conduct may much more rea&s;onably be referred to a want of motives and a total ignorance of the evil de&s;igns of M'Manus, than to his being an ac|complice with him, playing the part a&s;&s;igned him in this horrid drama, yet it does not &s;trike me that the conduct on which we comment is entitled to that &s;ettled, marked character which can furni&s;h a conclu&s;ive inference either way. Sure, I am, that it is enough for us to &s;how that it is problematical in a ca&s;e where law and rea&s;on join in &s;aying that the evidence to convict &s;hould not only be manife&s;t, but &s;o manife&s;t that it could not be contradicted.</P>
<P>We have gone further, and &s;hown that when weighed in &s;cales equally poi&s;|ed, our inferences preponderate. The deduction then which I draw from this head of the te&s;timony is, that there does not exi&s;t any grounds from which a violent pre&s;umption nece&s;&s;arily implicating Francis Cox in this inhuman tragedy can be drawn, but on the contrary &s;o far as the te&s;timony is operative, it e&s;tabli&s;hes a &s;trong probability that he was a mere dupe, Ignorantly led in|to his pre&s;ent critical &s;ituation by the artifice of M'Manus, and con&s;equent|ly that it can give no &s;upport to the tottering foundation formed out of the tran&s;action at Manheim. As to the unmeaning &s;tupid &s;tory of Cox when in|toxicated, abu&s;ed and chagrined, which compo&s;ed the third opening of the gentlemen, and which was kept in re&s;erve (though known to them long before) till every thing el&s;e was exhau&s;ted, as it pretends to inculpate Pat. Donagan, I &s;hall, to avoid repetition, defer the con&s;ideration of it till I arrive at that period of this cau&s;e, when I can with propriety, con&s;ider its force a|gain&s;t both.</P>
<P>Permit me to &s;olicit your attention to that &s;y&s;tem of evidence laid before you again&s;t Pat. Donagan, which the gentleman who opened on behalf of the Commonwealth, &s;tated to be &s;o point blank, that it will cer|tainly bring him to the gallows. I tru&s;t, before I &s;it down, to be able to convince you, that in&s;tead of it being point blank again&s;t the pri&s;oner, it has in reality no point, and that even its colouring is all borrowed from that delu&s;ion and prejudice, which has &s;o generally &s;ettled on the public mind. To di&s;pel this illu&s;ion from independent and hone&s;t minds, requires nothing more than a candid di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the grounds of charge which ari&s;e out of

the evidence. The&s;e re&s;olve them&s;elves into &s;ix points: 1&s;t. That Pat. Donagan was an inmate at Hauer's about a year previou&s;ly to this mourn|ful cata&s;trophe&mdash;was often in company and intimate with him. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly. That he applied for the wiederkomme drops repeatedly to different per&s;ons, both in company with Hauer and alone, di&s;covered a peculiar anxiety to get them, offering at different times, twenty, thirty, and fifty pounds for a gill; and at one time he and Hauer &s;aid they mu&s;t be had, if they co&s;t five hun|dred or a thou&s;and pound, for the purpo&s;e (as the gentleman &s;tated in his o|pening although there is not a particle of proof of it) of poi&s;oning the Shitz's. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly. That Pat. Donagan the latter end of October or beginning of November, preceding the murder, bought half a quarter of powder of George Kapp, who thinks the bag and powder found after the murder at Shitz's, are the &s;ame he &s;old Donagan, though neither had any mark. 4thly. Pat. was at Logan's, in company with M'Manus, when the latter had a warrant again&s;t him, went armed to keep o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the con&s;table, and then threatened Jacob Miller who came there, if he came near, apprehending him to have the warrant. 5thly. In the language in which it was opened, that he had the precaution to leave Hauer's and &s;leep at a neighbour's, where he in&s;i&s;ted on having a per|&s;on to &s;leep with him, though he never did &s;o before when he &s;lept there.&mdash;6thly. What pa&s;&s;ed in pri&s;on.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t you in forming a ju&s;t e&s;timate of them, I &s;hall con&s;ider them fir&s;t Individually, and then collectively. That Pat. Donagan &s;hould have ever had his home at the hou&s;e of John Hauer, has been emphatically his misfortune; but it is neither a crime, nor any evidence of a crime. Men in low life, obliged to make their livelihood by the &s;weat of their brow, and forced to make their homes at places which &s;uit their bu&s;ine&s;s, very &s;eldom have much choice in fixing them&s;elves. The bu&s;ine&s;s is neither profitable, accommo|dating, nor agreeable, to per&s;ons in re&s;pectable circum&s;tances. This cla&s;s of people are, therefore, nece&s;&s;itated to make-&s;hifts, and accept of &s;uch places as offer. Sufficiently hard is the condition of &s;uch men, without wantonly imputing to them the vices and crimes of tho&s;e with whom they &s;o &s;paring|ly re&s;ide. Patrick Donagan's duty and inclination to pur&s;ue the unwearied toil of hone&s;t indu&s;try, left him little time to &s;aunter away at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;The bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;tone quarrying, and race digging, which he pur&s;ued in diffe|rent and di&s;tant parts of the country, made his ordinary returns to Hauer's
<PB N="112" REF="034040_0113_0FFA4BC4A5FA32D0">
much le&s;s frequent than that of common inmates who u&s;ually confine their pur&s;uits to the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Hence, opportunities for contracting intimacies and attachments, and forming confederacies, mu&s;t have been rare indeed. Much le&s;s would it be in his power to di&s;cover the character and conduct of Hauer, and his hou&s;ehold. But, it is &s;aid, that Patrick kept company, and was on terms of intimacy with him. This would be the fair re&s;ult of prudence and di&s;|cretion. For &s;trange and untoward indeed mu&s;t be the conduct of that man, who would &s;light the ordinary relations of intercour&s;e, which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between an inmate and&punc; his landlord. Such civilities evidence no attachment, much le&s;s any confederacy. It is true, Peter Shitz mentioned that whenever he came to Hauer's, when Donagan was there, Donagan and Hauer went out and whi&s;pered &s;omething. No man has le&s;s di&s;po&s;ition to remark on the conduct and evidence of this young man than I have, yet as to this part of his te&s;|timony, it is in all probability more the re&s;ult of &s;ub&s;equent feelings, than of ob&s;ervation made at the time, and to any one who has heard the fiery ordeal he has pa&s;&s;ed through, it will not be thought &s;trange, that things in them|&s;elves the mo&s;t indifferent, &s;hould appear to him magnified into a &s;ubject of well founded &s;u&s;picion. It would be &s;trange indeed, if men bent on his de|&s;truction, &s;hould in this very &s;u&s;picious manner be concerting the means of effecting it under his very eye, when nothing could exi&s;t which induced &s;uch a bare faced nece&s;&s;ity. I for my part, cannot entertain &s;o mean an opinion of the under&s;tanding of my client, as to believe that if he had been a per&s;on de&s;tined to act a part in this tragical drama, he would have hazarded marring the plot by &s;uch undi&s;gui&s;ed and &s;u&s;picious appearances; at all events, it is no evidence, as it is perfectly unknown what was the object of it; and you are not at liberty to conjecture about it. If you were, the probability is, from the manner in which it was done, that it related to &s;omething no way connected with this bu&s;ine&s;s and perfectly innocent in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;econd ground is con&s;idered as a main prop in this pro&s;ecution, and has been introduced with all that di&s;play, which was nece&s;&s;ary to give it its full <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. I tru&s;t, however, it will be a very ea&s;y matter, in the favor|ite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the public pro&s;ecutor, "to knock away the blocks" on which this prop is rai&s;ed, and lay the hollow and vi&s;ionary fabric pro&s;trate and

harmle&s;s at this unfortunate man's feet. That Patrick Donagan did apply for and &s;earch after the wiederkomme drops, with an anxiety and zeal, bordering on enthu&s;ia&s;m, and with a credulity commen&s;urate with its my&s;|terious virtue, was acknowledged by him on his fir&s;t examination, and would never be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">enie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> by him in any &s;ituation; but that he entertained evil de&s;igns in &s;o doing, or harbored a thought of injury or prejudice to any one by it, we utterly deny. On this we take i&s;&s;ue and call on the gentlemen for their proofs. The affirmative lies with them, and it is their bounden duty to prove it. Nothing can be taken for granted if the inquiry involved in it the value of a cent only; much le&s;s can it be when the life of this man is &s;taked on the i&s;&s;ue. I then call upon the gentlemen to &s;how, to point out to you, to lay their finger on that part of the evidence which proves that this man had bad intentions; that the object for which he was getting the&s;e drops was <HI>evil.</HI> To prove to you that the evidence does not contain any &s;uch proof, and that, on a fair con&s;truction, it carries with it a contrary pre&s;ump|tion, permit me to con&s;ider it as &s;tated to you by Doctors Stau&s;e. Orn|dorf and Koenigmaker. As the facts related are fre&s;h upon your minds, I &s;hall not trouble you with repeating them, but refer my&s;elf entirely to you for the pertinency and propriety of my ob&s;ervations upon them.&mdash;By a re|currence to the&s;e gentlemen's te&s;timony you will find the grounds of accu&s;a|tion re&s;olve them&s;elves into the following particulars. That Hauer was con|cerned; that they were &s;ought after by Donagan with great anxiety; that he actually offered fifty pounds for a gill, and declared they mu&s;t be had if they co&s;t a thou&s;and pounds; that he was hurt and very angry at Orn|dorf's not getting them; that when a&s;ked if they were going to try projects with them, he &s;aid, yes; that they were the colour of laudanum; that they had got them before, but they were not &s;trong enough. I &s;hall con&s;ider their weight, and point out the concurrent circum&s;tances which di&s;prove and de|&s;troy their application.</P>
<P>Hauer was concerned, and certainly the projector of the necromancy, which in all probability was de&s;igned to hang Donagan in&s;tead of hurting Shitz, by which he expected to &s;weep the hard earned money of Donagan into his own pocket. In the wide field of conjecture which this bu&s;ine&s;s opens, Hauer's character and conduct &s;eem to lead to the above conclu&s;ions. But be that as it may, there is nothing di&s;clo&s;ed by the conduct of either,
<PB N="114" REF="034040_0115_0FFA4BC99EA65040">
which points out poi&s;oning as the object of the&s;e drops. Judging from the e&s;&s;ay made with them, they were mere jugglery which was to prepare the way for the &s;ub&s;tantial part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, the hanging. That any thing could be effected by them upon Peter Shitz was totally out of the que&s;tion, as he had already experienced the effects of the &s;cheme; and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> removed to his brother's more than a year before. But with the gentlemen, to be acquainted with Hauer, is cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion; and to be concerned in any of his intrigues, though the object of them is utterly unknown, and the probability is that you are duped into and likely to be the victim of it, is cau&s;e of condemnation. To me it appears that the fair conclu&s;ion from Donagan's anxiety to have the drops, and his folly to purcha&s;e them at any rate, &s;hows clearly that he had no evil intentions to effect by them. The application at Lebanon, a con&s;iderable town much frequented, at a &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the habit of doing bu&s;ine&s;s, was in open day, in the mo&s;t u&s;ual and public manner, to a gentleman of character, without my re&s;erve or injunction, accompanied with the mo&s;t undi&s;gui&s;ed conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> of the re|&s;erve of phy&s;icians&mdash;tells him he need not be afraid of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oing any harm&mdash;mentions the places where, and one of the gentlemen of whom, they had been got&mdash;propo&s;es getting from Doctor Luther the Latin or Engli&s;h name of them to enable Mr. Stau&s;e to procure them&mdash;the &s;ame anxiety to pet them is accompanied with the &s;ame openne&s;s, the &s;ame unre&s;erve in the application and intercour&s;e with Doctor Orndorf&mdash;he tells him, Doctor Fahn&s;tock had them, of his applying to him and the Doctor's laughing at him&mdash;urges and tempts him to apply to Mr. Fahn&s;tock, to Doctor Keller for them&mdash;tells him they had been got of Luther, but were not &s;trong enough. And even at the election at Shaefer's town, in a tavern, in a room full of company, does he tell Hauer of his failing in &s;ucce&s;s, on which it is openly mentioned, in the pre&s;ence of Orndorf, that they would have them if they co&s;t a thou&s;and pound. At Doctor Koenigmacher's the &s;ame publicity is manife&s;ted. Do|nagan takes with him when he makes the application, a man of confe&s;&s;edly good character, and enjoins no &s;ecrecy. Apprehen&s;ive that his failure here|tofore in getting the drops, might have ari&s;en from &s;ome po&s;&s;ible bad applica|tion which they might be liable to, and which the Doctors might have ap|prehended, and apprized that he was thus laying the train by which the mine would inevitably be &s;prung upon him if he had evil in view, we find him coming forward and offering &s;ecurity to the amount of one thou&s;and or
<PB N="115" REF="034040_0116_0FFA4B790F188468">
ten thou&s;and dollars not to hurt any one with them. To make the fir&s;t &s;tep towards murder by poi&s;on, in the face of circum&s;tances &s;o unau&s;picious to &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;o ominous of detection, evinces &s;uch gro&s;s folly and &s;tupidity, that nothing &s;hort of po&s;itive proof can entitle it to belief with any rea&s;ona|ble man. It would &s;urely be committing murder for the &s;ake of being hanged. But it is &s;aid he was &s;en&s;ibly alive to the di&s;appointment at Orn|dorf's, and was angry with him. The more fooli&s;h a man's projects are, the more &s;en&s;ibly he feels a failure in effectuating them. His di&s;plea&s;ure at Orn|dorf was however a tribute due to the principles of moral rectitude. Orn|dorf had promi&s;ed him, not only once or twice, but many times, to go in a limited time to Dr. Fahn&s;tock's, and had uniformly broke his promi&s;e and di&s;appointed him. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Patrick had been dead in feeling to this repeated di&s;|regard for truth, it would have argued much more &s;trongly than his irrita|bility at it, his capability to comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the deed they impute to him. Had it not been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the opening for the pro&s;ecution, that Donagan's an&s;wering yes, to the que&s;tion put to him by Doctor Stau&s;e, that he &s;uppo&s;|ed they were going to try projects with the drops, was nearly tantamount to a confe&s;&s;ion of the views they impute to him, I &s;hould have been at a lo&s;s to di&s;cover in an an&s;wer &s;o evidently &s;ugge&s;ted by the tran&s;action it&s;elf any cri|minality. To have denied that he had projects to be effected by drops, to which he was willing to give any price, would have evidenced a lying &s;pirit and bad motives. The an&s;wer was true, and given with that readine&s;s and complacency which &s;howed him neither influenced by apprehen&s;ion nor dread. On the Doctor's a&s;king him the colour of the drops, we find Hauer pointing to &s;ome liquid of a browni&s;h colour, from which the gentlemen in|fer, though the Doctor did not intimate any thing like it, that it was lauda|num they were after, which unduly taken will poi&s;on, and having got thus far, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it out with another conjecture, that Donagan intended to poi|&s;on, and having the &s;taff and intention thus manufactured, there is nothing wanting but the per&s;ons to be poi&s;oned; they therefore add the Shitzes, which produces the propo&s;ition to be demon&s;trated, that Donagan was in &s;earch of laudanum to poi&s;on the Shitzes. In this way allowing one infer|ence to produce another, with the aid of a few conjectures to &s;upply vacan|cies, the mo&s;t upright man or &s;et of men in the community may be &s;trung <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Far be it from me to think any of the gentlemen concerned for the pro|&s;ecution capable of wi&s;hing to influence it to this extent; every per&s;on who
<PB N="116" REF="034040_0117_0FFA4BD1B0A79100">
knows them it convinced that it is impo&s;&s;ible; but the zeal of duty, the &s;en&s;ibility of feeling and the diffu&s;ive latitude of the evidence on which they are to be employed on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, call upon them to guard again&s;t tho&s;e extremes of which the opening certainly partook, not intentionally I am &s;ure, but from incorrect &s;tatements which had been made by the wit|ne&s;&s;es, of what would be the te&s;timony. The only ground which remains to be con&s;idered, that has been advanced as &s;upporting the conjecture, that Donagan was in &s;earch of drops to poi&s;on the Shitzes, is, that it was men|tioned both to Doctor Stau&s;e and Doctor Orndorf, when he &s;poke of the drops got of Doctor Luther, that he fail, they were not the real &s;tuff, they were not &s;trong enough; whence they make the deduction, that if they had been &s;trong enough, they would have poi&s;oned and had been u&s;ed to poi&s;on. This is begging the que&s;tion. They take for granted what we utterly deny, and what the whole &s;tory di&s;proves, that the quality of the drops applied for to Doctor Luther were poi&s;onous. Here they &s;hould begin and e&s;ta|bli&s;h their premi&s;es, before they attempt to draw their conclu&s;ion. There is no crime which the gentlemen could not e&s;tabli&s;h again&s;t the mo&s;t innocent man on earth, by this &s;ort of logic. If the drops <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for to Doctor Luther had been de&s;igned for murder, is it po&s;&s;ible to believe that they would thus openly and unnece&s;&s;arily be brought forward as the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation to all per&s;ons and on every occa&s;ion? Surely not. Indeed, from every account we have of tho&s;e drops, they appear to have no qualities but what are extremely innocent. Patrick had been per&s;uaded to believe they were calculated to exhilarate and enliven the &s;pirits, and from actual ex|perience of their effects on Peter Shitz, we are warranted in concluding they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no noxious quality. It is apparent, Hauer u&s;ed them to catch the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> curio&s;ity and to fix the wavering credulity of tho&s;e he attempted to prac|tice upon in a more &s;ub&s;tantial way, without expecting from them any other re&s;ult.</P>
<P>I have thus con&s;idered the weight of tho&s;e grounds which have been open|ed as proving that Patrick Donagan &s;ought after the wiederkomme drops for the purpo&s;e of poi&s;oning the Shitz's, and tru&s;t, that con&s;idered individually, &s;o far are they from proving it, that they actually di&s;prove it, and &s;how that he had no &s;uch de&s;igns. I would &s;olicit a moment's attention from you, to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> collective &s;trength; for I admit, that a number of circum&s;tances taken
<PB N="117" REF="034040_0118_0FFA4BD55D92F028">
together, may prove a fact which con&s;idered &s;eparately, they would not e&s;tab|li&s;h. The gentlemen's conclu&s;ion from the te&s;timony of Doctor Stau&s;e, Orn|dorf, and Koenigmaker is, that Pat. Donagan wanted to procure the wiederkomme drops to poi&s;on the Shitz's. Our fir&s;t an&s;wer is, that it is no where proved that the&s;e drops were poi&s;onous, and you are interdicted by your oaths from pre&s;uming it. In the &s;econd place, we &s;how you that Do|nagan's conduct throughout evinces he had no &s;uch intention, becau&s;e it was uniformly open, public and undi&s;gui&s;ed, and marked with tho&s;e palpable and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> traces, which would have rendered detection inevitable, in ca&s;e &s;uch in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> gone into effect. Thirdly, if poi&s;oning had been intended, I would have been effected without expence, without expo&s;ure, and without a probability of detection. Doctor Stau&s;e tells you, an ounce of ar&s;enic, which he would have &s;old to any one for &s;ix pence, without notice or enqui|ry, would have &s;we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the whole family of the Shitz's from the face of the earth. To men, who&s;e object the gentlemen &s;ay was murder, money and concealment; I leave you to judge, which of the&s;e means of effecting them by poi&s;on would have been preferable. And fourthly, we &s;how you that in the ignorance, the folly, the credulity, the intere&s;t, and the practices of men, this conduct of Donagan's is more ea&s;ily and rationally accounted for, than by &s;uppo&s;ing its object to be blood. We contend that the whole tran&s;action evidently &s;peaks it to be one of tho&s;e many impo&s;tures which we &s;ee daily practi&s;ed by per&s;ons wi&s;hing to acquire gain from a pretended know|ledge of the occult &s;ciences; and that Pat. Donagan's mind was &s;o power|fully influenced by it, as to induce him to become a perfect dupe to it. That the principles of this delu&s;ion are &s;trongly implanted in human nature, no man of information or ob&s;ervation can deny.</P>
<P>In all ages and in all countries (notwith&s;tanding, they have had line upon line and precept upon precept again&s;t it,) it has continued to be practi&s;ed. When it comes forward under the &s;educive appearances of innocence, of intention and injury to no one, to o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er to man on the ea&s;y terms of belief, &s;ecrecy, and concurrence, wealth&mdash;unbounded wealth&mdash;the object of his re&s;tle&s;s days and anxious nights, it &s;peaks a language to the ea&s;y credulity of the laborious and uninformed cla&s;s of mankind, which they find it difficult to re&s;i&s;t, and which they never repel with indignation. And even among&s;t us, "the mo&s;t enlightened people upon earth, broad is the way that leads

The young and the old, the indu&s;trious and the lazy, the gay, the &s;erious, the religious and the au&s;tere, are frequently &s;ound paraded on the &s;ame circle per|forming with all the zeal of &s;incerity and the officiou&s;ne&s;s of anxiety, that ri|tual of ab&s;urdity which is to di&s;&s;olve the enchantment, and &s;urrender up to its votaries the trea&s;ures which are to reward them. La&s;t week, in York, there was di&s;clo&s;ed an illu&s;trious &s;acrifice, made by upwards of one hundred per|&s;ons, reputably &s;ettled and connected there, of all tongues and languages, of their under&s;tanding, and even of their common &s;en&s;e, to this demon of &s;educ|tion in a project, the proce&s;s of which was much more ab&s;urd and expen&s;ive than the pre&s;ent, but the object of which was the &s;ame. And if I mi&s;take not, numbers of the good people of this re&s;pectable county of Dauphin, at a period not very di&s;tant were the dupes of a like &s;pecies of delu&s;ion.&mdash;Charity, then, which is the mantle of religion, and the faire&s;t ornament of our nature, mu&s;t be a total &s;tranger to the brea&s;t of that man, who could im|pute murderous motives to this unfortunate pri&s;oner, from a piece of conduct which re&s;olves it&s;elf on the plaine&s;t principles of com|mon &s;en&s;e and its own internal evidence, into one of tho&s;e ordi|nary but delu&s;ive occurrences which &s;o often excite the curio&s;ity of mankind. Indeed, the native and gentle &s;pirit of humanity is &s;o infu&s;ed and predomi|nant in the rules of law which pre&s;ume innocence, and exclude from weight in capital ca&s;es, all conduct which can be rea&s;onably accounted for in any other way that your duty concurs with. What mu&s;t be the inclination of every humane mind, to refer this piece of conduct and its re&s;ult to that mode of accounting for it, which &s;tands with mercy? The third ground of charge re&s;pects the powder purcha&s;ed of Mr. Kapp. To treat this head in the manner it de&s;erves, would ill become this &s;acred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, and the pre|&s;ent &s;olemn occa&s;ion. My ob&s;ervations, therefore, will be confined to &s;how how very inconclu&s;ive and de&s;titute of any rational applications it is. The &s;imple fact is, that about the beginning of November, Donagan bought half a quarter of powder at Kapp's &s;tore; in the ordinary run of bu&s;ine&s;s, with|out being accompanied with any circum&s;tance to make or fix attention. It is true you were told in the opening, that Patrick was fixed on to get the
<PB N="119" REF="034040_0120_0FFA4BE1CC6FB740">
powder for the bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;that he a&s;ked for the be&s;t kind&mdash;and got it folded up in a particular way, like that of the bag found; but as not a particle of proof has been given of either of the&s;e particulars, you are bound to di&s;card them: and I am &s;ure, the gentleman's candor who introduced them to your notice, will join in this reque&s;t. In this fact then there is no indication of guilt. The &s;pace which lies between it and murder is truly immea&s;urable. But to give it application, be plea&s;ed to attend to what the gentlemen wi&s;h you to do. What is it? Why, that you &s;hould pre&s;ume Patrick Donagan bought the powder to &s;hoot Francis Shitz; that it was the identical powder that de&s;troyed him. And on what grounds are you a&s;ked to take this dar|ing, this inhuman flight, when you have the life of a fellow creature in charge? None, I am confident to &s;ay. As to the idle account given by the witne&s;s, of the likene&s;s between his bags and the one found at Shitz's, after it was con&s;iderably rumpled and dirtied before he &s;aw it&mdash;tho' he reluc|tantly admits he could not di&s;tingui&s;h between his own bags&mdash;or between bags made of the &s;ame paper by other people in the u&s;ual way&mdash;that num|berle&s;s other &s;tore keepers might have like paper&mdash;as he did not get it all&mdash;and of the likene&s;s between his powder and the powder &s;ound&mdash;though he admits he did not buy all there was of the &s;ame quality&mdash;that others in the neighbourhood deal with the &s;ame per&s;on al&s;o&mdash;that he does not keep any account or take any particular notice of tho&s;e he &s;ells powder to; they can|not ri&s;e to the dignity of being noticed on this &s;erious hearing. It is the mere opinion of the witne&s;s, formed from premi&s;es &s;o equivocal and open to objection, that every man of experience mu&s;t &s;ee that the opinion it&s;elf is ra&s;h and thoughtle&s;s in the extreme. So remote and improbable was this connection that it did not occur to the witne&s;s or agents of the pro&s;ecution for a length of time after the murder, though Donagan was apprehended and examined in their pre&s;ence the next day in the very place. The gen|tlemen's fourth ground of charge is founded on what pa&s;&s;ed at Mr. Lo|gan's, as related by Jacob Miller. I confe&s;s my&s;elf perfectly at lo&s;s to know where to begin to give a &s;erous an&s;wer to this part of the accu&s;ation. The only fact upon which it is re&s;ted, is that he was there at the &s;ame time M'Manus was, who went armed to guard him&s;elf again&s;t the con&s;table. It cannot be pretended that they were there on any formed de&s;igns, as there is no proof of any &s;uch thing, and it is expre&s;sly proved, that Logan and wi&s;e were in company with them. It cannot be pretended that Donagan
<PB N="120" REF="034040_0121_0FFA4BE90449EE50">
took any part in the improper conduct of M'Manus, or countenanced him to it, as their own witne&s;s proves expre&s;sly that he did not. Indeed, &s;o en|tirely harmle&s;s and unlike a prelude to murder was the &s;cene, that even their witne&s;s tells you he joined them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ent at lea&s;t half an hour in their com|pany drinking with them. If merely happening to be in company with M'Manus, furni&s;hes any evidence again&s;t Donagan's life, I &s;u&s;pect the next pro&s;ecution for aiding to commit murder that will be heard of in the County of Dauphin, will be again&s;t Logan and his wife, not only for being in company with M'Manus, but allowing him to be at their hou&s;e&mdash;an a|gain&s;t Jacob Miller for intermixing and drinking out of the &s;ame gla&s;s with a man who intended to commit murder. How tottering mu&s;t the &s;uper|&s;tructure be which &s;tands in need of &s;uch arguments as the&s;e to &s;upport it. As the cau&s;es of objection multiply they increa&s;e in ingenuity and curio&s;ity, of this we have a very &s;ignal di&s;play in the fifth head of accu&s;ation. Dona|gan, the opening &s;ays, the night of the murder had the precaution to &s;leep at Mr. Illig's. The whole guilt of this propo&s;ition ari&s;es from the language in which the gentlemen have expre&s;&s;ed the fact, and not from the fact it&s;elf which pointedly impugns it. He &s;ays, had the precaution which implies contrivance and de&s;ign, and imports as u&s;ed here, that Donagan went there to avoid &s;u&s;picion and to conceal his being concerned. The fact as related by Mr. Illig, is, that he came there to &s;ettle with him, &s;taid all night, and when they were about beginning in the morning, the con&s;table came and took him. That Pat. expre&s;&s;ed &s;urprize at the murder, but neither changed countenance nor expre&s;&s;ed any backwardne&s;s to go. Does all or any of the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;how precaution, or furni&s;h any evidence of it? If &s;uch conduct &s;hows precaution, I would be glad the gentlemen would point out that behavior on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, as they would account in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. At one moment the gentlemen make him the author of the lot, "ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing in the whirlwind and directing the &s;torm;" at another, when the moment of execu|tion approaches, they a&s;&s;ign to him the timidity of the hare, &s;eeking &s;helter from the tempe&s;t he had created. Is it not on the contrary, the conduct of a man con&s;cious of no crime? To help out this forced con&s;truction given to conduct in it&s;elf &s;o indifferent, the opening &s;tated, that Donagan was very anxious, and in&s;i&s;ted to have &s;ome per&s;on to &s;leep with him that night: but when we come to hear the evidence, this allegation is not only not proved, but expre&s;sly di&s;proved. Ob&s;erve then the dilemma to which the pri&s;oner is
<PB N="121" REF="034040_0122_0FFA4BEC92A03FE0">
reduced by this mode of rea&s;oning. He is to be hung for going to Mr. Illig's that night, becau&s;e, the pro&s;ecution &s;ays, it &s;hows precaution, which evinces knowledge of the plot; and if he had been &s;o unfortunate as to have &s;taid at Hauer's, the gentlemen would then have made that demon&s;tration plain of his guilt. So that going or &s;taying, his fate was inevitable. Death was his doom. This mode of arguing re&s;embles the bed of the bloody and inhuman Procru&s;tes; if the victim was too long, he lopt him off&mdash;if too &s;hort, he ex|tended the &s;hivering members till they fitted. The &s;ixth and la&s;t head which the pro&s;ecution has endeavored to re&s;t upon, relates to what pa&s;&s;ed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ail, when the pri&s;oners were intoxicated, as related by Mr. Rahm. It is not incumbent on me to extenuate, or in any way excu&s;e the impropriety of this conduct;&mdash;It is apparent. But perhaps to a mind &s;en&s;ibly alive to the &s;ailings of human nature, an apology in &s;ome degree extenuating, might be found in the uninterrupted &s;everity of a long and tedious confinement. Be that as it may, it cannot influence the que&s;tion now trying. As to Dona|gan, it is not entitled to be con&s;idered as evidence again&s;t him; as declara|tions of one man not on oath cannot affect another, unle&s;s his conduct in the intercour&s;e countenances and introduces it. Tried by this principle of law and rea&s;on, how do Cox's denunciations affect Donagan? Not in the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree, becau&s;e they are not only repelled with contempt and indignation, as the empty threats and lying &s;ugge&s;tions of a mind &s;tung and goaded to madne&s;s by abu&s;e, in&s;ult and degradation; but he &s;olicits, chal|lenges, nay even defies him to tell every thing he knew of him that was con|&s;i&s;tent with the truth. If Cox had known any thing prejudicial to Donagan, is it po&s;&s;ible to believe that this treatment of him, in the &s;ituation in which he was, would not have given vent to it? If Donagan had not been con&s;cious that Cox could not &s;ay any thing of him which would be prejudicial, can it be believed that he would thus have acted with the boldne&s;s of the lion at a time when the fawning of the &s;paniel would have been his only chance of &s;afety? The gentlemen's maxim is, that when liquor is in, wit is out, which applied to Cox, &s;hows he had nothing to di&s;clo&s;e, otherwi&s;e his &s;ituation would have given it full vent, and the &s;ecret would have been out.</P>
<P>In addition to the&s;e &s;trong marks of Cox's declarations being the effect of rage, di&s;appointment and degradation, which is no uncommon weapon of vulgar minds, when overcome in point of &s;trength, we find when the time
<PB N="122" REF="034040_0123_0FFA4BEF481C1C60">
arrived that they were to go into effect, by being di&s;clo&s;ed to the Judge, and Patrick &s;till continued oppo&s;ed to a reconciliation, unle&s;s Cox would tell what he knew of him, that Cox declares he had wronged him. This evi|dently was the truth; for we find, when Cox was called on by one of the gentlemen concerned for the pro&s;ecution, to enquire if he would confe&s;s, which call alone, un&s;olicited and una&s;ked for by the pri&s;oner, pledged the Commonwealth to in&s;ure his impunity again&s;t any thing he di&s;clo&s;ed, he de|clared in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner before his God, that he knew nothing to reveal. Is it po&s;&s;ible to believe, if Cox had been the man this pro&s;ecution repre&s;ents him to be, that when tempted by every thing human that his &s;oul could wi&s;h&mdash;impunity again&s;t his crimes, and liberty from his clo&s;e and hard confinement, at the moment when this trying hour was rapidly approaching, that he would not have made full di&s;covery as the means of his &s;afety? Surely not, if you judge him by the ordinary principles of human action. But permit me to a&s;k you what tho&s;e &s;ecrets were, which this intoxicated man &s;aid he would di&s;cover? It no where appears in the evidence&mdash;the in|genuity of the gentlemen has not found a name for them&mdash;"&s;hadows, clouds and darkne&s;s re&s;t upon them." Whether if they actually exi&s;ted (which I utterly deny from the complexion of the evidence) they related to this bu&s;i|ne&s;s or to any other matter, is altogether unknown: And when the que&s;tion is, whether the&s;e men are "to be or not to be," I am &s;ure your inclinations will concur with your duty in refu&s;ing to plunge into this unfa|thomable aby&s;s to de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>In this inve&s;tigation I have endeavored to familiarize you to the principles of evidence which enter into this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, by explaining them and pointing out their application to the different parts of the evidence and their opera|tions upon it: but as the principles of every &s;cience as well as tho&s;e of the law, mu&s;t in their nature be con&s;iderably ab&s;tracted and theoretical, and of cour&s;e not &s;o impre&s;&s;ive on the minds of men unaccu&s;tomed to the habitual u&s;e of them, as the ca&s;es which gave ri&s;e to them, I mu&s;t &s;olicit your atten|tion while I &s;how to you the practical application of them from a few adjudg|ed ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ervation of life being the fir&s;t object of nature and of &s;ociety, our laws have manife&s;ted the mo&s;t &s;acred regard for it. It has therefore become

The defendant when he received the bill of lading was ordered by the merchants and owners to put in at Lynn Regis, in Norfolk, in order to get a Mediterranean pa&s;s for his &s;afe|ty. It was proved by one witne&s;s, who was the carpenter of the &s;hip, that the defendant when he came near to Dartmouth-bay, tampered with him to know what he would take to knock the &s;hip on the head. It was proved by another witne&s;s, that the defendant gave the &s;hip's crew &s;ome bowls of punch on the day the &s;hip was burnt, and made them all drunk; and afterwards ordered the witne&s;s to make a fire in the cabin, where there was none for a month before that time; which he did when the defendant and mo&s;t of the crew were going on &s;hore, except two who were very drunk; and that there was but one bucket belonging to the &s;hip, which the defendant had ordered a &s;ailor to &s;ling overboard the day before the &s;hip was burnt. The two &s;ailors who remained drunk in the &s;hip made oath, that they were &s;leeping there until the &s;hip was &s;o much on fire that they could not relieve her, nor them&s;elves, but that they were

<P>Having gone through the te&s;timony which has been laid before you on behalf of the pro&s;ecution, and endeavored to mea&s;ure it by the rules of evidence, and to weigh it in the &s;cales of rea&s;on, as it relates to both the pri&s;oners, I find my&s;elf impelled to congratulate the humane feelings of every per&s;on who hears me, that it is not only found wanting, but greatly wanting&mdash;to e&s;ta|bli&s;h either of the charges.</P>
<P>But although the pri&s;oners might with great &s;afety rely on the groundle&s;&s;|ne&s;s of the pro&s;ecution for their deliverance; yet, impre&s;&s;ed with a due &s;en&s;e of duty to them&s;elves and a re&s;pectful deference for you, they have fur|ni&s;hed, and we have laid before you (the only additional evidence which the nature of the ca&s;e admits of on their behalf) the mo&s;t re&s;pectable te&s;timony of both the pri&s;oners having, before this calumny was created, exten&s;ive|ly and uniformly &s;upported the character of quiet, indu&s;trious, &s;ober and hone&s;t men.</P>

<P>GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,</P>
<P>However painful may be the ta&s;k which we are now to perform, yet it is a duty we are bound not to &s;hrink from. There is ju&s;tice due to the com|monwealth as well as to the pri&s;oners; if they are guilty they de&s;erve to be
<PB N="127" REF="034040_0128_0FFA4C050C758788">
puni&s;hed; and it will be required at our hands, that we &s;hould endeavour by a full and correct, yet candid &s;tatement of the facts, and ju&s;t argument ari&s;ing out of &s;uch facts, that they may not e&s;cape upon mi&s;taken principles of humanity or compa&s;&s;ion. We are not bound to go further, or to embark our pa&s;&s;ions in a ca&s;e of this nature. And although it has not been frequent in capital ca&s;es to call in the aid of additional coun&s;el on the part of the &s;tate; yet when the complicated nature of this ca&s;e was con&s;idered, the probable length of a number of trials, and the many able and ingenious coun&s;el employed for the different pri&s;oners, the duty, falling alone upon the pub|lic pro&s;ecutor, would have been laborious in the extreme. It was, therefore, in this remarkable ca&s;e thought prudent to engage other coun&s;el, not for the purpo&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion, but to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the fair inve&s;tigation of the facts.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners at the bar have been very ably defended. Every thing that could po&s;&s;ibly be done or &s;aid for them, has been done and &s;aid by their coun&s;el. And if the re&s;ult of this important trial &s;hould be unfortunate to them, it will not be becau&s;e the greate&s;t exertions have not been u&s;ed on their behalf; for they have di&s;charged their duty faithfully towards them.</P>
<P>It becomes us, then, with as much clearne&s;s as we are able, to con&s;ider the arguments you have heard on their behalf, and to oppo&s;e to them &s;uch rea&s;oning upon the facts as we &s;hall judge proper. You will give &s;uch weight to the arguments on either &s;ide as you &s;hall coolly and deliberately think they de&s;erve. If the rea&s;ons for an acquittal are &s;tronger than tho&s;e for a convic|tion, you will of cour&s;e acquit. Having done our duty faithfully, but pre&s;&s;ing nothing unduly, we &s;hall leave the fate of the pri&s;oners with you, well &s;atisfied, that you will decide as your con&s;ciences &s;hall direct you.</P>
<P>We, on our parts, do indeed believe, that, when the whole evidence is con&s;idered, and deliberately weighed by you, there can be little doubt but the re&s;ult mu&s;t be unfavourable to the pri&s;oners. If we did not believe this, upon rational grounds, it would be unpardonable in us to pre&s;s for a con|viction, which will affect the lives of the&s;e men. But we are to convince your under&s;tandings, not to inflame your pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="034040_0129_0FFA4C0960FFFF80">
Gentlemen, there are three pri&s;oners before you, whether they are to live or to die, depends upon your verdict. We are to con&s;ider how the evidence applies to each of them. With re&s;pect to John Hauer it would have been nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;aid but little, if we did not conceive that the circum&s;tan|ces relative to him, furni&s;h the &s;tronge&s;t evidence to account for the conduct of the other pri&s;oners at the bar. It is with an eye to them that we find our&s;elves con&s;trained to detail, &s;omewhat minutely the wicked conduct of John Hauer; not that we think it nece&s;&s;ary to induce his conviction. He &s;tands before you undefended, &s;elf-condemned; a melancholy in&s;tance of the depravity of man!</P>
<P>We mean to &s;how, gentlemen, a deliberate, long premeditated plan on the part of John Hauer to de&s;troy the lives of the two brothers of his own wife. That he made a variety of efforts to accompli&s;h his dreadful purpo&s;e&punc; alone, una&s;&s;i&s;ted; with every po&s;&s;ible degree of art to prevent a di&s;covery. All the&s;e efforts failed. The &s;ignal e&s;capes which they made, &s;trongly mark|ed by the finger of Providence, &s;eemed to make no impre&s;&s;ion upon his cal|lous heart. He was determined to per&s;evere in his &s;cheme of blood, until the innocent victims of his vengeance &s;hould be laid in the du&s;t. With this iniquitous view, we find him combining with the wor&s;t of men; men who would not &s;hrink from murder; fit for &s;tratagems and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, and who from their hardened minds, were competent to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the dire plan he had conceived.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is hard to believe that a crime &s;o malignant, could be de|liberately contrived merely from the malice of the heart; where no previous provocation exi&s;ted, no vengeance was to be gratified, unle&s;s &s;ome hope of advantage was to re&s;ult from the deadly deed. But it is not difficult to trace the &s;ordid motives which operated upon the mind of John Hauer. The te&s;timony upon this point is expre&s;s and conclu&s;ive. It was the inor|dinate de&s;ire of wealth that gave a &s;pring to all his actions. So &s;trongly did it influence him, that he was content to grow rich by iniquity; and if his darling object could not otherwi&s;e be accompli&s;hed, he was willing to ob|tain it by imbruing his guilty hands in his brother's blood.</P>

Scarcely had old Peter Shitz grown cold in his grave, than the ba&s;e di&s;po|&s;ition of the pri&s;oner began to &s;how it&s;elf. He became di&s;contented with the provi&s;ion which his father in law had made for him; and he attempted, without any ground to &s;upport him, to conte&s;t the old man's will; and ac|cordingly entered a <HI>caveat</HI> again&s;t the probate of it, in the regi&s;ter's office of this county. But he was obliged to relinqui&s;h this vain pur&s;uit. It is immaterial to inquire why Peter Shitz gave a le&s;s portion of his property to the wife of John Hauer, than to his &s;ons. Every man has a right, by the law of this country, to di&s;po&s;e of his own property, by will, as he plea&s;es. Probably he might, with an exact eye, have beheld the demerit, and &s;ordid di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;on-in-law. Be it as it may, having &s;o willed it, it was the duty of that &s;on-in-law to acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>Finding it was not in his power to invalidate the old man's will; in pur|&s;uit of the &s;ame object, he endeavored to work upon the fears of his brothers; the gho&s;t of their departed father could not re&s;t, unle&s;s they would con&s;ent to &s;hare the property he had left behind him, more equally. Gloomy &s;uper|&s;tition mu&s;t be called in to work the wondrous effect! Their reverence for a decea&s;ed parent, and an anxiety that his troubled &s;pirit &s;hould again repo&s;e in peace, he &s;uppo&s;ed, would induce them to endeavor to atone, by a dif|ferent di&s;tribution, for the &s;uppo&s;ed inju&s;tice their father had committed up|on earth! Peter Shitz, whom you have &s;een, does not appear to be po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of the &s;tronge&s;t mind: How Francis was, we know not. Probably he differed not much from his brother. Minds &s;uch as theirs might be well fit|ted to receive tho&s;e &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions by which &s;uper&s;tition chains down the under&s;tanding; and keeps it almo&s;t con&s;tantly under the dominion of fear. Even in our day, the &s;ame belief which prevailed among mo&s;t nations in the rude&s;t &s;tages of &s;ociety, that the dead can a&s;&s;ume a vi&s;ible form, and revi&s;it, the living, fixes a &s;trong hold upon the weak and uninformed; nor has the bright &s;y&s;tem of Chri&s;tianity yet been able to eradicate its baneful influence over many minds. Under the powerful dominion of &s;uch a belief, there is no knowing how far the infamous art of Hauer might have wrought upon the weak minds of his brothers. But this impo&s;ture was accidentally detected by Hoffman. He dragged the &s;pirit from his lurking hole. It was not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> un&s;ub&s;tantial air; but a living body, clothed in fle&s;h, in the &s;hape of Hauer. He intreated him not to tell; but the faithful old man, who had been the
<PB N="130" REF="034040_0131_0FFA4C0ED8FB89D0">
affectionate &s;ervant of their father, immediately told them of the impo&s;ition. This plan could then &s;ucceed no more; his deep laid contrivance was de|tected and expo&s;ed. But &s;till he did not relinqui&s;h his point. He went on &s;tep by &s;tep, and every &s;tep he took, he increa&s;ed in guilt. He prepared his horrid mind for the mo&s;t cruel actions. The youth and &s;implicity of Pe|ter Shitz rendered him a proper &s;ubject for his malignant art and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. He was able to bend him to his purpo&s;es. He is &s;carcely, at this day, more than eighteen years of age. Credulous to the extreme, he was induced, by Hauer, to believe the greate&s;t ab&s;urdities. At the period we are now to &s;peak of, Peter lived in the hou&s;e of his brother-in-law. He was, however, de&s;irous to leave it; and accordingly hired with his cou|&s;in at Tulpehocken. This would have deranged the plan that Hauer had formed for his de&s;truction. He prevailed upon him not to go, by rea&s;ons addre&s;&s;ed both to his avarice and his fears. He per&s;uaded him that every morning, by u&s;ing certain drops, by &s;ome kind of magic, he might receive a pur&s;e, with five doubloons in it; a mighty charm for him, if he &s;hould be able to accompli&s;h it! But le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t he &s;houl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> be in the way of advice, and better information, it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep him from his friends. He was told, under the mo&s;t &s;olemn imprecations and unmerciful oaths, that Shaefer and Bomberger, the executors of his father's will&punc; were determined to bind him out; that they came every day for him, and declared they would have him dead or alive. Terrified at this, he was in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uced to conceal him&s;elf He dared not to go to his co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;in's at Tulpehocken, for there he would be within the reach of his &s;uppo&s;ed enemies. By the&s;e means, with the aid of oaths and fal&s;ehoods, he fixed a re&s;traint upon the young man's freedom of will and action; and by impre&s;&s;ing him with an ungenerous fear of his friends, he kept him completely under his own power. This could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to la&s;t long. No time was to be lo&s;t to bring on the tragedy he was about to act. There can be no doubt but that poi&s;on was, at this time, the means he meant to employ. Whether Hauer was the &s;ecret occa&s;ion of the gene|ral &s;ickne&s;s of the family, which has been related to you, by mixing &s;ome|thing with their food, without their knowledge, we can but conjecture. He had frequent acce&s;s to the hou&s;e; and the idea certainly corre&s;ponds with all his conduct afterwards. It is a &s;trange circum&s;tance unaccounted for. The next circum&s;tance is, his bringing the three phials from Lebanon; and having impre&s;&s;ed Peter with the idea that the drops in the&s;e phials were
<PB N="131" REF="034040_0132_0FFA4C1553C5B8C8">
to empower him to procure the daily pur&s;e; he induced him to drink of them. It is to be ob&s;erved that Peter was reluctant, and unwilling to ta&s;te them; but Hauer a&s;&s;ured him they would do him no harm. Accordingly, one evening, de&s;irous to clo&s;e the &s;cene, he per&s;uaded him to try to procure the pur&s;e; and the better to deceive him, he him&s;elf drank fir&s;t out of the large phial; but the &s;mall phials, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to contain the deadly draught, he never touched; and when he thought Peter had taken &s;ufficiently from them, and that the great end would &s;oon be accompli&s;hed, he told him he would not try that night, he thought it was not worth while&punc;&mdash;Can any one then doubt what were his motives in per&s;uading the boy to drink out of tho&s;e phials? Fortunately, however, for Peter, Hauer was deceived in his me|decine; it turned out to be innocent and ineffectual; the potion he procured from LEBANON WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH! Failing in this, other means mu&s;t be pur&s;ued. Since the drops would not operate, another ceremony mu&s;t be gone through. Under the continued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of trying for the pur&s;e, he and his brother Solomon led him down to Wolfer&s;berger's barn, a &s;olitary &s;pot, remote from any hou&s;e, where no a&s;&s;i&s;tance could be had, and where the horrid bu&s;ine&s;s could be ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed on without any human eye to ob&s;erve them. But Providence was watchful over the fate of Peter Shitz. The ba&s;e con|trivance was again defeated by an unexpected accident; and the young man has providentially &s;urvived to tell the di&s;mal tale.&mdash;In this lone&s;ome place, in the &s;ilence of the night, (under &s;uch influence was the weak mind of Peter Shitz) Hauer had addre&s;s enough to cau&s;e him to fa&s;ten a rope round his neck, with the end of it tied to the upper joi&s;t of the barn. In this &s;ituation he was prevailed upon to believe, that a &s;pectre would appear with the pur&s;e of gold. When it was thought that he was &s;ecured, and that nothing up|on earth could re&s;cue him from death, Solomon Hauer pu&s;hed him from his &s;tand, that he might hang and die. But the rope broke, and he fell upon the thre&s;hing floor of the barn, which he &s;tained with his blood. The mi&s;cre|ants fled, and left him, in this unhappy &s;ituation to &s;hift for him&s;elf, and e&s;cape if he could. Gentlemen, how callous mu&s;t that man's heart be, who could do the&s;e things! Though all his &s;chemes had hitherto been bla&s;ted, yet his hardened con&s;cience was never touched with remor&s;e; he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his diabolical pur&s;uit! On their return to Hauer's hou&s;e, Hauer expre&s;&s;ed a regret that things had all gone wrong. No doubt he was di&s;appointed in the mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h of his heart; he panted for the de&s;truction of his bro|thers.
<PB N="132" REF="034040_0133_0FFA4C17ED53ED78">
By day and by night, for years, it had occupied all his thoughts. It is &s;trange, gentlemen, that after all the&s;e things, the eyes of this young man were not opened. He &s;till continued the dupe of the artifice of his brother-in-law. He promi&s;ed not to tell: And the better to prevent a di&s;covery; and that it &s;hould not be known that the &s;kin was taken from his neck by the rope, he accompanied Solomon Hauer, by the direction of John Hauer, to their father's plantation near Bethlehem. Had Hauer &s;ucceeded in this la&s;t wicked act, it is more than probable he never would have been brought to an account for it. It was artfully conceived; and it would have appeared &s;o like an act of &s;uicide, that a different &s;u&s;picion would &s;carcely have been awakened. As the fact really turned out, and perhaps with a view to re|new the attempt, we find him propagating &s;tories that Peter Shitz was de|ranged, and that he expected he would endeavor to take away his own life; that in ca&s;e he &s;hould fall the victim to his avarice, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a con&s;equence of melancholy or in&s;anity. He however told different &s;tories about it to different people. He related the &s;ame circum&s;tance in ways to|tally incon&s;i&s;tent with each other. To Jacob Mehs he declared that Peter had really attempted to hang him&s;elf, and that he ju&s;t di&s;covered him in time to cut the rope; that he &s;truck him until he brought the blood from him, which, if he did not believe it, he might &s;till &s;ee upon the floor at Wolfer&s;berger's barn. To Wolfer&s;berger him&s;elf he told only, that he thought Peter would hang him&s;elf; that he was &s;ometimes out of his head; &s;ometimes had a pi&s;tol in his pocket, and &s;ometimes a rope. That, the &s;e|cond time, he followed Peter to the barn, and found him concealed in the clover hay; that he &s;truck him until he fell upon the floor; and that if he did not believe it, he might go up, and he would &s;ee the blood upon the thre&s;hing floor. Wolfer&s;berger did indeed go up, and he &s;aw plenty of blood upon the barn floor. But he &s;aw more; he &s;aw what Hauer did not expect or calculate upon; he &s;aw the broken rope lying near the blood!&mdash;Gentlemen, it is truth only that is uniformly con&s;i&s;tent. When people take pains to conceal the truth, the very means they pur&s;ue, for the purpo&s;e, mo&s;t frequently leads to detection. They will tell &s;o many different &s;tories that they cannot balance together; when they come to be weighed in the &s;cale of probability, no room can remain to doubt of their fal&s;ity. Such is the wi&s;dom of providence, that villainy is often expo&s;ed by the very ways which it &s;eeks for concealment.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="034040_0134_0FFA4C1A09BA1CC0">
Every attempt which Hauer made by him&s;elf, or with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his brother Solomon, thus failed. Means more bold and de&s;perate mu&s;t be re&s;orted to. That he employed a number of per&s;ons hardened enough to commit the fact, is beyond a doubt. Who they were, is your pre&s;ent in|quiry. The heavy charge is brought again&s;t the pri&s;oners Donagan and Cox. The confe&s;&s;ions of Hauer you have heard read. The Judge has told you that they are evidence only again&s;t Hauer him&s;elf, and not again&s;t the o|thers&punc; that it &s;hould not affect them, and that you mu&s;t &s;eek for other evidence of their guilt. To all this we agree. The confe&s;&s;ion, however, proves a very material circum&s;tance; that a con&s;piracy of the mo&s;t dark and dreadful nature was formed to take away the lives of Francis and Peter Shitz; that the price of blood was agreed upon. Who were the actors in this bloody tragedy remains to be inve&s;tigated. When a con&s;piracy is once formed, the act of one con&s;pirator is the act of all; but then we mu&s;t, it is true, fir&s;t prove the connection between them. The artful management of tho&s;e concerned in this ca&s;e, has really rendered this difficult. To di&s;cover them we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to pre&s;umptions. Some of tho&s;e pre&s;umptions are of a re|markable nature and &s;hould they even not be deemed &s;ufficiently &s;trong to warrant a conviction, yet they mu&s;t forever leave the mind un&s;atisfied of the innocence of the pri&s;oners. We will &s;how you, therefore, gentlemen, how the &s;ub&s;equent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and circum&s;tances, and matters which will be brought home to the pri&s;oners, are connected with all that happened before, and are exactly of the &s;ame kind, and appear to have the &s;ame object as tho&s;e which preceded, and which relate to Hauer alone, before he had any know|ledge of Patrick Donagan. (See 6th Term Rep. 528.) We conceive it impo&s;&s;ible that &s;ome of the circum&s;tances could have occurred, or that &s;ome of the expre&s;&s;ions of Donagan can be accounted for, unle&s;s he had had an inti|mate knowledge, from the lips of Hauer him&s;elf, of all that had already been done, and the de&s;igns he had in view. The connection of Donagan and Hauer, and the time when Donagan fir&s;t became an inmate at Hauer's hou&s;e, more than a year ago, though the force of the ob&s;ervation has been endeavored to be weakened, are very material in this ca&s;e. It mu&s;t have been then that the &s;y&s;tem began to be changed. And we think that it will appear that Donagan had an active hand in all that followed. Previous to this, Hauer had no knowledge of the&s;e Iri&s;hmen, M'Manus and others; one of whom, it is decided, is guilty of the fact; he knew nothing of their di&s;po&s;i|tions
<PB N="134" REF="034040_0135_0FFA4C1BD863CE10">
and characters, and their fitne&s;s for the work of blood. Probably he never would have thought of them, if they had not been brought to his know|ledge by their own countryman, Donagan.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, all this is pre&s;umptive evidence; it is dangerous to rely on it; and they have read to you &s;ome law ca&s;es upon the &s;ubject, and have applied them artfully to your pa&s;&s;ions. If not rightly under&s;tood, they may do much harm, and almo&s;t in every in&s;tance arre&s;t the arm of ju&s;tice. We will endeavor to do away the effect that the gentlemen have de&s;igned to bring about, in their ob&s;ervations upon them, and to &s;how you the true &s;tate of the law upon the &s;ubject, before we proceed further; and we tru&s;t we &s;hall not break in upon the rules of law as they really are; for they are founded in wi&s;dom and propriety.</P>
<P>It is true, gentlemen, it is &s;aid in 2 Lord Hale, 289, that it is better five guilty per&s;ons &s;hould e&s;cape than one innocent per&s;on &s;hould die, and Mr. Black&s;tone adopts the &s;entiment, in his 4th vol. 358. All this may be well enough to induce a rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary caution. But the principle is very often introduced, as it has been upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, as an argu|ment again&s;t any conviction at all upon pre&s;umptive evidence.</P>
<P>Certainly, however dangerous it may be to pre&s;ume too much from a &s;ingle, &s;olitary circum&s;tance: yet where a number of circum&s;tances combine, where they all &s;eem to unite, to corre&s;pond, and lead to the &s;ame conclu&s;i|ons, though any one of them &s;eparately might appear trivial and inconclu&s;ive, they will together form a ma&s;s of te&s;timony, irre&s;i&s;tible, and which can &s;carcely be mi&s;taken. Why does the law permit you to hear &s;uch evidence, if, the moment you have heard it, you are to throw it a&s;ide as de&s;erving of no con&s;ideration? When a ca&s;e is brought before you, which de|pends not upon po&s;itive proof, but upon a variety of circum&s;tances, tend|ing to prove a certain fact, as hone&s;t men, regarding the &s;olemn oaths you have taken, you are bound to con&s;ider it, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Court, deliberately and maturely, to give it all the weight it de&s;erves; and if it carries with it conviction to your minds, it is your duty to act upon it, fearle&s;s of the con&s;equences; u&s;ele&s;s, otherwi&s;e, would be tho&s;e rea&s;oning faculties, and that capacity to judge, which God has given you.

not to reject &s;uch evidence, becau&s;e it may be called pre&s;umptive evidence; nor becau&s;e a great and benevolent Judge, in the overflowings of his huma|nity, has declared, that it is better five guilty per&s;ons &s;hould e&s;cape, than one innocent man &s;hould die. If &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions are thus perverted, and a weight given to them, which it was certainly never intended, (and it would be unrea&s;onable) they &s;hould have, what, gentlemen, is to become of the ju&s;tice of the country in criminal ca&s;es? In&s;tead of five or ten guilty per&s;ons e&s;caping, &s;carcely one could be puni&s;hed. The midnight murderer calls no witne&s;&s;es to behold his guilt! If not upon pre&s;umptive evidence, how are you to trace out half the vallainies and crimes of murderers and felons? They mu&s;t all remain unpuni&s;hed. A jury, under the continual dread of do|ing wrong, are never to do right. In more than half the crimes that are committed, no po&s;itive proof could po&s;&s;ibly be procured. How are you to di&s;cover the dark a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, unle&s;s by tracing the means by which, or the mo|tives for which, he committed the deadly deed? Former grudges, threaten|ing expre&s;&s;ions, other un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts, e&s;pecially where great advanta|ges are expected to re&s;ult from the act; the purcha&s;e of poi&s;on, or other in|&s;truments of death, without being able &s;atisfactorily to account for them; and a variety of circum&s;tances, unu&s;ual and extraordinary in the conduct of men, and which can only be calculated for mi&s;chief, and not otherwi&s;e ac|counted for, mu&s;t, as the ca&s;e may be, be brought up, when the unhappy occa&s;ion &s;hall require it, to be publicly inve&s;tigated; and upon their &s;trength or weakne&s;s, mu&s;t the objects at whom they are pointed, &s;tand or fall. But, gentlemen, do the ca&s;es which have been read, lead to the ab&s;urd conclu&s;i|ons you are reque&s;ted to draw from them? By no means. The two in&s;tances put by Lord Hale, are ca&s;es, where the very killing was never proved. Where it was even pre&s;umed that a murder had been committed, and therefore he tells us, that he never would convict of murder, unle&s;s the fact of the murder were proved to be done, or, at lea&s;t, the body found dead. That is not the ca&s;e here; there is no doubt here that a dreadful murder has been commit|ed. That being the ca&s;e, Lord Hale no where &s;ays that we &s;hall not have recour&s;e to pre&s;umptive evidence to di&s;cover who the murderer was. He does, indeed, &s;ay, it mu&s;t be WARILY u&s;ed. Be it &s;o. To this we have no objection. Con&s;ider it well; but do not &s;uffer your&s;elves, by &s;uch arguments as you have heard, UNWARILY to reject it.</P>

With re&s;pect to the ca&s;es in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Mod. they are not difficult to be an&s;wered. Whether they are truly reported or not, we cannot a&s;certain here; the book which contains them is certainly not a book of very great authority.

They e&s;tabli&s;h no rule of law; nor does any judge undertake to declare that pre&s;umptive evidence is not &s;ufficient to induce a jury to convict in a criminal ca&s;e. The&s;e ca&s;es do indeed inform you, that the evidence being only pre|&s;umptive, the juries did not think proper to convict the defendants. What &s;ort of juries they were; or how they were directed by the Court, no where appears. But in one of the ca&s;es the acquittal &s;eems to us extremely &s;trange; we mean the ca&s;e of Sprigg and Oakley. We know not what kind of evi|dence that jury might require. The running the goods on the coa&s;t of Ire|land; the repair of the boat; the rapid increa&s;e of the water; the owner re|maining under deck all the time; the circum&s;tance of the purcha&s;e of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> u&s;ele&s;s auger; the refu&s;al of the ma&s;ter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ailors to go down into the hold for the purpo&s;e of a &s;earch; and, above all, the fal&s;e pretext that both the &s;hip and cargo were lo&s;t, when the cargo had actually been landed in Ireland, pointing out the great object of the de&s;truction of the &s;hip, we conceive ought to have placed the matter beyond a doubt with rea&s;onable men. That jury do not appear to have been &s;uch. There have, however, been juries who have acquitted again&s;t the plaine&s;t proof; there may be &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; and tho&s;e ca&s;es might be brought to apply to the pre&s;ent, equally as well as the two ca&s;es in 8th Mod. We think no jury in this country could re&s;i&s;t &s;uch evidence as was produced in that ca&s;e. The be&s;t that can be &s;aid for the&s;e ca&s;es, is, that the facts of burning and &s;inking the &s;hips did not conclu&s;ively follow from the circum&s;tances proved; they might have happened from other innocent cir|cum&s;tances.&mdash;But then this ab&s;urdity follows, that a bare po&s;&s;ibility of inno|cence, is, in &s;uch ca&s;es, to de&s;troy the mo&s;t rational ground of pre&s;umption of guilt. Upon the whole, we hope this jury are to be guided by their own judgments; and not by what a jury in any other ca&s;e has done; when for aught we know, that jury might have been compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t ignorant or the mo&s;t corrupt of men. As to the ca&s;e in 8th Mod. 249, where Gilbert is made to &s;ay, "that a man &s;hall not be found guilty and hanged upon pre|&s;umption," it falls within the ca&s;e cited by Lord Hale; a man was indict|ed for &s;tealing the goods of a per&s;on unknown, merely becau&s;e he would not give an account how he came by them; and he was thought to be too poor

<P>If, gentlemen, you compare all the evidence together, you will find it &s;o connected, that the latter circum&s;tances could not have exi&s;ted without the former. Can it be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that Donagan was ignorant of the de&s;igns of Hauer after what you have heard? Who but Hauer could have informed him of the wiederkomme drops? A &s;tranger to this country, un|acquainted with German terms and expre&s;&s;ions, where could he have acquir|ed the notion of any &s;uch thing, unle&s;s by rea&s;on of his intimacy and con|nection with Hauer? For we do not find any other per&s;on than Hauer, who knew any thing about &s;uch a medicine, or that had ever heard of the name. And we well know they were drops &s;o called by Hauer, and he had attempt|ed to make u&s;e of them, long before we hear of any acquaintance between him and Donagan. We think it is very evident; too, that he knew the ob|ject to which they were to be applied. But to oppugn this, you are told that he was under a belief of gho&s;ts, and that he wi&s;hed, for certain purpo&s;es, by means of tho&s;e drops, to rai&s;e up the &s;pirits of the dead; that he had heard of this magic power attributed to the&s;e extraordinary drops, and was anxi|ous to procure them for the purpo&s;e of experiment. Strange &s;ugge&s;tion! They have told you that Donagan does not want under&s;tanding; and yet they would have you believe him to be the verie&s;t fool upon earth! What man is there of any under&s;tanding, who can for a moment &s;uppo&s;e that the grave can yield up its contents, or that departed &s;pirits have power to hold conver&s;ation with man! The&s;e are all the vi&s;ionary chimeras of an heated brain! the creation of a di&s;turbed fancy! For the minds of tho&s;e who are under the rational influence of the religion we profe&s;s, mu&s;t di&s;card &s;uch ideas; and mu&s;t be per&s;uaded that the grave has not the power to &s;urrender up its dead, until the la&s;t trump &s;hall rou&s;e them from the long &s;lumber of ages! That he de&s;igned to procure wealth by means of the&s;e drops, we believe. But
<PB N="138" REF="034040_0139_0FFA4C33A94D0F20">
it was by adding to the number of the dead, that he expected to accompli&s;h this end. How el&s;e do you account for his anxiety, and his earne&s;t de&s;ire to procure the drops, when he was in company with Hauer him&s;elf, if he had not known the u&s;e to be made of them? if he had not been acquainted with the whole &s;ecret? For you will ob&s;erve, that when Hauer procured the drops from Dr. Luther, who then lived at Lebanon, and when he pretend|ed to have got them from Bethlehem, he had no acquaintance with Dona|gan. How then did Donagan become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a knowledge of all the&s;e facts and circum&s;tances, unle&s;s from an intimate communication between him and Hauer re&s;pecting it? For he declares to Dr. Stau&s;e, that he had got &s;ome from Bethlehem, and from Dr. Luther before, but they were NOT STRONG ENOUGH. Now from this expre&s;&s;ion of Donagan, can you doubt for a moment that the knew all about the potion that had been admini&s;|te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to Peter Shitz, and that it failed in its operation; it was not STRONG ENOUGH to produce the de&s;ired effect? His conduct at Orndorf's is al&s;o remarkable; his ri&s;ing in the price &s;o rapidly; his repeatedly calling for it. It did not &s;uit him to go to Dr. Luther. His potions were not STRONG ENOUGH. Why wi&s;h to procure the drops by means of third hands? If they were harmle&s;s and innocent, why did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e not at once go to Fahn&s;tock and others him&s;elf, where he declared &s;uch medicine was to be procured? It would rather appear, that by his earne&s;tne&s;s&mdash;by the &s;ums offered, and by his demand of an unknown medicine, he wi&s;hed to tempt and &s;educe the per&s;ons to whom he applied to anticipate him, and to give him a deadly poi&s;on. It is &s;aid we have not &s;hown the drops were poi&s;onous, nay more, we have not &s;hown the drops them&s;elves. We cannot tell what they were. We know of no one who can give us any information about them. But tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Donagan was in &s;earch of a deadly poi&s;on, is beyond conjecture. Why el&s;e his &s;ugge&s;tion, that he knew it was a medicine that the Doctors DID NOT LIKE TO SELL? Why &s;o many dark hints about it? Why de&s;ire to procure it at any price&mdash;beyond the value of any medicine yet known? Why his re|peated declarations that he meant no harm with them? Why did he declare to Dr. Koenigmacher, that he would bind him&s;elf in 1000 or 10,000 dollars that he would not hurt a living creature with them? Why all this, we an&s;wer, if it was an harmle&s;s liquid, and not a deadly poi&s;on, which he was in &s;earch of? If it was not to contain in it the power to harm, the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions could mean nothing. That he meant to try projects as Dr. Stau&s;e called them, is morally certain; but they were projects of the mo&s;t malignant kind!&mdash;</P>

Gentlemen, the circum&s;tance of the powder has been treated with much levity by the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oners. That it might have been purcha&s;ed innocently is true. That this may not be the &s;ame powder, is al&s;o po&s;&s;ible. It would have been more &s;atisfactory if Donagan had attempted to give any evidence of the purpo&s;es to which he had applied the powder, which, it is be|yond a doubt, he purcha&s;ed of Mr. Kapp. One would &s;uppo&s;e this would have been within his power. If he had been making any innocent u&s;e of gun|powder after that purcha&s;e, either by blowing rocks or otherwi&s;e, he might ea&s;ily have &s;hown it.

The &s;mallne&s;s of the quantity found, (there being but half a quarter of a pound purcha&s;ed of Kapp,) being in|&s;ufficient for almo&s;t any other purpo&s;e; and in the &s;ame kind of bag <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> purcha&s;ed by a per&s;on who was the inmate of Hauer, comparing it with all that went before, with their joint re&s;earches for the wiederkomme drops and with the fatal event that followed, the death of Francis Shitz by mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the powder out of &s;uch a bag, and Donagan not attempting to account<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for any other u&s;e made by him of the powder he purcha&s;ed; renders it ex|tremely probable it is the identical powder purcha&s;ed by Donagan, to be u&s;ed for the horrid purpo&s;e actually effected by it; and that he knew it, and that of cour&s;e it ought to be con&s;idered as very material, and forming a weighty part of the great ma&s;s of evidence in this ca&s;e&mdash;But the jury will give it &s;uch weight as they think proper.

<P>Gentlemen, all the&s;e men are lately from Ireland; and it is &s;urely worthy of remark, that, Hauer had no knowledge of any of them until after his in|timacy with Donagan. How el&s;e was M'Manus, who was to become a principal actor in the bloody &s;cene, introduced to the acquaintance of Hau|er, if not through the means of Donagan? Donagan, from his knowledge of the&s;e men, mu&s;t have procured them to commit the murder. He mu&s;t have been the agent, the contriver; he mu&s;t have a&s;&s;i&s;ted intimately in the general plan. Is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that Hauer, without any knowledge of M'Manus, who had lately come into the country, would have acted &s;o
<PB N="140" REF="034040_0141_0FFA16EEF3233790">
wildly as to have communicated &s;o important a &s;ecret to him, unle&s;s he had been directed to him by Donagan, who was intimate with him, who mu&s;t have known him and his bloody di&s;po&s;ition well? Is it probabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, if we mu&s;t rea|&s;on &s;o much upon probabilities, that the&s;e men could have been &s;earched out or procured in any other way, than by the interference of Donagan? We find Donagan and M'Manus frequently together. Gentlemen, it is no trifling circum&s;tance, their being together at Logan's, where M'Manus had the two odd pi&s;tols, highly charged. That tho&s;e very pi&s;tols were at Shitz's hou&s;e on the night of the murder, is to be pre&s;umed from the &s;ingular cir|cum&s;tance, of the uneven ram-rods &s;ound in the hou&s;e; one was longer than the other; &s;o was one of the&s;e pi&s;tols longer than the other; the old one was a little longer than that which appeared to be more new.&mdash;The time when the&s;e pi&s;tols were &s;een by Miller in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of M'Manus, corre&s;ponds very well too, with the time mentioned by Kapp, when the powder was purcha&s;ed of him by Donagan. The coincidence of circum&s;tances is &s;urely remarkable.&mdash;</P>
<P>As a proof of the innocence of Donagan, it is contended that he was ten miles from the &s;cene of action, on the night of the murder, in a re&s;pectable hou&s;e. It is true this is &s;o proved, by a character highly re&s;pectable. But what is that to the purpo&s;e? It matters not where he was after he had &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the whole machine in operation; it cannot po&s;&s;ibly tend to prove his innocence. If we had indicted him as principal, then this circum&s;tance might be material to be inquired into; but we have charged him only as an acce&s;&s;ary before the fact, and not at all as being pre&s;ent: &s;o that his being ten miles off concludes nothing. This circum&s;tance, however, requires a little more examination.&mdash;We cannot conceive that his being at the hou&s;e of George Illig is any proof of his innocence. It rather appears to corre&s;pond with a general plan, art|fully contrived beforehand, with a view to avoid detection. It is &s;omewhat &s;ingular that he left his home at this very time. Who can he&s;itate to believe that he purpo&s;ely went away, in order that Hauer might bring &s;ome &s;tranger into the hou&s;e who might be a witne&s;s for him; and accordingly Baker is brought there to &s;leep in the room with Hauer and his wife; which he had never done before. When he came there he naturally a&s;ked for Donagan, and was told he had gone away that morning to Illig's. He then a&s;ked for M'Manus's wife. Charles had taken her away&mdash;&s;o that it &s;eems to have
<PB N="141" REF="034040_0142_0FFA4C3F060C5318">
been agreed, that the whole knot &s;hould &s;eparate, and each one of them have a voucher as to his being in a certain place on that night, in ca&s;e &s;uch evidence &s;hould be required at a future day.&mdash;From the declaration of Hauer to Baker, it would &s;eem as if Donagan had left his hou&s;e in the morning; it was not until night that he went to Illig's. What he was about all that day he has not attempted to explain; it is left to be conjectured; mo&s;t probably be was a&s;&s;i&s;ting to arrange the horrid bu&s;ine&s;s which was to be tran&s;acted in the night. He has thought that it would be &s;ufficient if he could make it appear that he was in a decent hou&s;e at the time of the murder. Accordingly he was to be at Mr. Illig's. Baker was to be at Hauer's. M'Manus was to pro|cure &s;ome one to be a witne&s;s for him. He endeavored to procure Caffry, and actually took Cox with him to the hou&s;e of Geiger.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would &s;eem from Hauer's confe&s;&s;ion, that the &s;ame plan was to be pur&s;ued by M'Donough who was to have witne&s;&s;es in the hou&s;e; but was to get out privately behind the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, through a hole in the wall.</NOTE>&mdash;Thus the whole bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eems to have been preconcerted; and this at once accounts for Donagan going to Illig's on that very night. It was the purpo&s;e of pro|curing a good witne&s;s in Mr. Illig. What was his conduct when the officer came to arre&s;t him? He did not appear to be concerned. There was no change in his countenance. The charge again&s;t him of &s;o dreadful a nature &s;eemed to &s;trike him with no terror, or apprehen&s;ion. He mu&s;t have expected this, and have been prepared to act that part; accordingly he turned round to Mr. Illig, and with the greate&s;t coolne&s;s and indifference, a&s;ked him for a few lines that he was there all night. This mu&s;t have been his object from the fir&s;t. If he had been innocent, he mo&s;t probably never would have thought of demanding &s;uch a thing. Nor would a man of the pure&s;t heart, who &s;hould be thus &s;uddenly cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ged with having committed a murder, bear up with the &s;ame pre&s;ence of mind: However innocent, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to meet a circum&s;tance of that kind with the &s;ame firmne&s;s and unconcern which Donagan evinced. His mind, therefore, was prepared for the event; he had &s;ettled the part he was to act upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>One of the &s;trange&s;t &s;ugge&s;tions has been made which we have ever heard: That Hauer was the projector of the necromancy, which was probably de|&s;igned to hang Donagan, in&s;tead of hurting Shitz, and to &s;weep Donagan's
<PB N="142" REF="034040_0143_0FFA4C410B7C23C8">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into his own pocket; and that Hauer's character and conduct &s;eem to lead to this conclu&s;ion. Now, how is all this to follow? or how would &s;he de&s;truction of Donagan have put his money into Hauer's pocket? We have been told Donagan was POOR, but hone&s;t. What object would his one or two hundred pounds have been to Hauer, if he could even have procured it by Donagan's death, in compari&s;on to the e&s;tate of the Shitz's whom they &s;ay it was not intended to hurt? But Hauer would not have got the money in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e of his hanging Donagan; he was not his heir; nor was any of his money in Hauer's hands; but all lodged, for &s;afe keeping, with Mr. Illig. How ab&s;urd, then, is &s;uch an ob&s;ervation. It is like the very many con|jectures which the gentlemen have made upon this occa&s;ion, which have no premi&s;es to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that it could not have been de&s;igned to poi&s;on by the&s;e drops <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that if that had been the intention, &s;ix pence worth of ar&s;enic might have been got, which would have been &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e. But, gentlemen, this would not have an&s;wered.&mdash;The poi&s;oning by ar&s;enic is the mo&s;t ea&s;ily di&s;covered of any poi&s;on that can be procured. It &s;eldom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ails of detection. It mu&s;t be mixed with &s;ome food, where it can be &s;een, or with &s;ome drink, where it would leave the &s;ettlings behind. The poi&s;oning by ar&s;enic ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo&s;t commonly furni&s;hed the means of di&s;covery. Be&s;ides, it is a well known poi&s;on to mo&s;t people. Large quantities are daily purcha&s;ed for the de&s;truc|tion of rats. In this ca&s;e it would not have an&s;wered the purpo&s;e. Peter Shitz, e&s;pecially, was to be &s;educed with a belief that certain drops, u&s;ed in a particular way, would put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great wealth. The potion was to be admini&s;tered under this di&s;gui&s;e. Ar&s;enic would not have an|&s;wered the purpo&s;e; he would have known what is was. His death would have been accompli&s;hed long before, but the drops happened not to be &s;trong enough, as Donagan him&s;elf declared. He would not, therefore, go back to Luther for them; but he endeavored to &s;earch out for &s;tronger drops, for the real &s;tuff, as he called it.

<P>No, gentlemen, he did not fly; and for the very rea&s;on which the coun&s;el have given. That indeed, would have been A MARK OF HIS GUILT. He know better. He was rejoicing in the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;cheme; and having e&s;caped would more naturally &s;uppo&s;e that his innocence had been made manife&s;t, or rather that his guilt could not be made to appear.

<P>We think, therefore, taking all the evidence, and comparing one circum|&s;tance with another, it &s;trongly implicates Patrick Donagan in the guilt of this murder. It is impo&s;&s;ible he could have been a &s;tranger to this horrid con&s;piracy to take away the lives of two innocent men, from the wor&s;t of motives. His whole conduct can not be accounted for in any other way, than by &s;howing him to be a party concerned; and it mu&s;t have been him and him only, who could have brought Hauer to the knowledge of the per|&s;ons and characters of M'Manus and the other Iri&s;hmen who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the execution of the plot. Hauer's conduct, con&s;idering this in any other point of view, was that of a madman; and without having the minds of the&s;e peo|ple prepared by one who knew them well, it would have been &s;trange in|deed for him, without any previous knowledge of them, to commit him&s;elf to them, unle&s;s he did it by the aid of &s;ome other per&s;on who mu&s;t have been greatly in his confidence. Every probability points out Patrick Donagan as the in&s;trument, and advi&s;er of Hauer, in procuring the&s;e bloody hands for the purpo&s;e of wreaking his vengeance on his two brothers-in-law.&mdash;With the&s;e ob&s;ervations we commit him to your hands.</P>

Not only per&s;ons procuring, but tho&s;e who even con&s;ent beforehand, are acce&s;&s;aries before the fact. For under the word AID are comprehended all per&s;ons coun&s;elling, abetting, plotting, a&s;&s;enting, con&s;enting and encourage|ing to do the act, and not pre&s;ent when the act was done. Fo&s;t. 126.&mdash;If he went to the hou&s;e of Geiger, with a knowledge of what was to happen, which is the circum&s;tance to be inquired into, and with a view, if any fu|ture occa&s;ion &s;hould require it, to add perjury to murder, by becoming a witne&s;s for M'Manus, and endeavouring to conceal the truth of the fact, (which does not call for the &s;tronge&s;t faith to believe) then is he completely within the &s;pirit of the law. It is &s;aid, however, with an air of triumph, (and almo&s;t every witne&s;s was a&s;ked the que&s;tion) that Francis Cox was never &s;een in the neighbourhood of the Shitzes, and that he was a &s;tranger to John Hauer. But of what con&s;equence is the circum&s;tance? It is not nece&s;&s;ary to prove that he ever was there, or that he ever beheld John Hauer before the fatal murder. The only point in i&s;&s;ue is, whether HE AIDED IN THE MURDER OR NOT; this may be done in a variety of ways; and altho' he never combined with Hauer or Donagan or M'Donough, yet if he a&s;&s;i&s;ted M'Manus, if he combined with, and was acce&s;&s;ary to him, it is all we are bound to prove&mdash;for a man may be acce&s;&s;ary to one and not to the other. He may even be a procurer of a murder, and yet never have &s;een the ac|tual perpetrator of the deed. If Hauer procured M'Manus to commit the murder, and M'Manus called in the aid of Cox, &s;urely it can be no defence for Cox that he never &s;aw Hauer! Why the gentlemen have taken hold of &s;o very trifling a circum&s;tance we are at a lo&s;s to know, unle&s;s it be, that they are &s;taggered by the &s;trength of the evidence, and know not what to &s;ay.&mdash;Fo&s;t. 125&mdash;6.</P>
<P>It is contended that the evidence does not furni&s;h any degree of probabili|ty that Cox was concerned, but lo&s;es it&s;elf in doubt, conjecture and un|certainty. Let us examine the force of this &s;ugge&s;tion. We find Cox, on the night of the murder, &s;leeping at the hou&s;e of Geiger, in con&s;equence of a pre-concerted plan for that purpo&s;e; becau&s;e all this had been arranged before at Manheim. Is it not then a very con&s;trained pre&s;umption, to &s;uppo&s;e that he did not know what he went there for&mdash;that he never a&s;ked any que&s;tion about
<PB N="145" REF="034040_0146_0FFA4C501DC0F568">
it? You are not only to conjecture this, but you mu&s;t go further, and you are to take it for granted that he is a fool and an ideot; that he was the dupe of a young fellow like M'Manus, and a number of other conjectures, which are rai&s;ed up, like magic, to do away the effect of the conclu&s;ion, which will naturally be drawn from the whole conduct of Cox. He and Caffry are to be carried to a certain hou&s;e, to remain all night, for a con&s;iderable reward, and yet are not to know what they are to do there. We find Caffry very naturally a&s;king for what purpo&s;e he was to go there; but he is not to be told without taking an oath to keep it a &s;ecret. It then naturally &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf to him that &s;omething improper was de&s;igned, and he refu&s;ed to go; though the idea was held out to him that for the mere act of going to the hou&s;e, and to remain there, while M'Manus was to go out, he was to receive &s;o much money as would keep him from the nece&s;&s;ity of working hard. But Cox is not to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame pre&s;ence of mind. He is to be led, like a fool, into the difficulty without knowing what he is about; he is &s;aid to be the dupe of M'Manus. In the next moment he is to have wit and reflection enough to &s;uppo&s;e that M'Manus meant to run away with &s;ome rich heire&s;s&mdash;and yet is to give him no aid in this &s;cheme, but to lie quietly in the hou&s;e. What a variety of &s;uppo&s;itions the gentlemen can now furni&s;h for Cox to ju&s;tify his conduct; and you are to wander, gentlemen, into what his coun|&s;el have called a wide field of conjecture, to try if po&s;&s;ibly Cox might not have been gulled into all this; and you are to dream very hard that he is &s;o great a dunce as to be impo&s;ed upon by the mo&s;t frivolous pretences. Un|fortunately, however, all the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions end in ab&s;urdity. Again, M'Ma|nus had borrowed a &s;addle from Geiger; and you are told that he might have held out this as an inducement to Cox, in order to di&s;gui&s;e his real ob|ject; and that the returning of the &s;addle appeared a plau&s;ible rea&s;on for his going to Geiger's. Well, then, two men are to be hired, at a great ex|pence, to go a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, to &s;leep at Geiger's, becau&s;e M'Manus had borrowed a &s;addle and wanted to return It! And when Caffry would not go, although the &s;tronge&s;t of temptations, money, was held out to him, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be &s;omething wrong, on account of the my&s;tery which ap|peared about it; Cox's ea&s;y credulity &s;uffers him to be &s;educed away, and to be led up to Geiger's, partly on foot, and then riding by turns, in the &s;everity of winter, to witne&s;s M'Manus returning a &s;addle! This is of a piece with the other conjectures. The only rational way of accounting for
<PB N="146" REF="034040_0147_0FFA4C5636B00FA0">
this conduct is, that Cox and Caffry were wanted as witne&s;&s;es, that they might be able to &s;wear, in ca&s;e M'Manus &s;hould ever be charged with the murder, that they went to bed with him in the evening, and that they ro&s;e with him in the morning, at a place five miles di&s;tant from the fatal &s;cene; and as to the intermediate time, of cour&s;e they would be a&s;leep, and not undertake to &s;ay any thing about him. It was for the purpo&s;e of perjury, then, that the&s;e men were wanted. Nor is it unlikely that they were to a&s;&s;i&s;t M'Manus in getting out of the hou&s;e without the knowledge of Geiger's family; they would have &s;lipped him out of the window, and let him in again on his return, as has been &s;aid by Mr. Clymer, Cox might have done, had he known any harm was intended; this, we &s;ay, was mo&s;t probably the &s;y&s;tem that was to be pur&s;ued; and then Geiger and his wife would al&s;o have been impo&s;ed upon, and without knowing the &s;ecret tran&s;actions of the night, they al&s;o would have been brought as witne&s;&s;es that M'Manus &s;lept in the hou&s;e all night, and would have gone far to have acquitted him, from that very circum&s;tance on his trial. But Providence ordered it other|wi&s;e. The three Jer&s;eymen came to the &s;ame hou&s;e, on the &s;ame night: two of them &s;lept in the &s;ame room with Cox and M'Manus; it therefore became impracticable to let him out of the window; it could not be done without a di&s;covery, which would immediately have led to a &s;u&s;picion that &s;omething wrong was going on. It therefore became nece&s;&s;ary for M'Ma|nus to make his way out as &s;ecretly as he could, which he endeavored to do, but the landlady had locked the door, and he was di&s;covered. It was too late to draw from his purpo&s;e, and he was determined to go on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t all ri&s;ques. It was further contrived, that by rattling &s;ome &s;tones on the roof of the hou&s;e, he was to be let in by Cox. And when he did return, &s;till in hopes to elude &s;u&s;picion, he did throw &s;tones on the hou&s;e, although he mu&s;t have &s;een the light through the window, and that the people were up. It is &s;ugge&s;ted that Cox had no motive for all this; that there was nothing to induce him to a&s;&s;i&s;t in this tragedy. If we make out a &s;trong ca&s;e, and the circum&s;tances &s;peak loudly as to his guilt, which we believe they do; it is immaterial whether he had any motive or not: or whether he aided the diabolical &s;cheme merely for the &s;ake of mi&s;chief. But we are &s;carcely left to conjecture that his iniquitous &s;ervices were to be repaid by a large reward in money.&mdash;</P>

The my&s;terious &s;cene at Manheim has called forth many ob&s;ervations from Cox's coun&s;el; and is &s;aid by them, at one would &s;uppo&s;e they would &s;ay, that it furni&s;hes no evidence of guilt. It is their duty, &s;peaking for their client, to weaken the circum&s;tances as much as they po&s;&s;ibly can. They tell us, among many other things which they have &s;ugge&s;ted, that Cox did not hear and under&s;tand what pa&s;&s;ed between M'Manus and Caffry, and of cour&s;e was not privy to M'Manus's de&s;ign; and 2ndly, &s;uppo&s;ing he did hear, it is only doubt and conjecture, that he knew what M'Manus's views were, and not &s;uch proof as the law requires.</P>
<P>We have already an&s;wered this &s;econd ground.

You are to u&s;e every ef|fort that a man, whom you can &s;carcely doubt to be guilty, &s;hall e&s;cape, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t by the remote&s;t po&s;&s;ibility on earth he might be innocent. In &s;hort, gen|tlemen, all pre&s;umptive proof is liable to the &s;ame objection. The ingeni|ous man may invent a variety of ways by which certain facts might po&s;&s;ibly have happened independently of tho&s;e circum&s;tances from&punc; which they mo&s;t naturally and mo&s;t probably follow. Then you mu&s;t &s;acrifice your natu|ral rea&s;on, you mu&s;t di&s;regard all con&s;i&s;tency and probability, and &s;urrender up your be&s;t judgment to the mo&s;t fallacious and ab&s;urd arguments that can be made u&s;e of.

It is to be ob&s;erved that M'Manus had no knowledge of Caffry. The young man left Derry, May was two years, in the &s;ame &s;hip with Cox. He was therefore well known to Cox. He had been his &s;hip mate. It was Cox therefore who pointed out Caffry to M'Manus; he &s;uppo&s;ed that as he was quite a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad, working journeyman's work at a &s;hoemaker's &s;hop, without any property to depend upon, that he might be readily induced to came into every mea&s;ure they might wi&s;h. But they were di&s;appointed. When M'Manus wi&s;hed for another witne&s;s, who&s;e con&s;cience, for the &s;ake of gain, would bend to circum&s;tances, Cox naturally turned his eyes to|wards Caffry. We find Cox, this fool and dupe of M'Manus, taking an active part in the bu&s;ine&s;s; he is really the agent, contriving to bring Caf|fry into the &s;crape, and managing a meeting between him and M'Manus for that very purpo&s;e. For, gentlemen, it was Cox him&s;elf who &s;ugge&s;t|ed to Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ry that he wanted to &s;peak &s;omething to him, and appointed the meet|ing in the evening. When Caffry went up, Cox was bu&s;y about &s;ome law bu&s;ine&s;s before the ju&s;tice; and he a&s;ked him what it was he wanted; Cox told him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> till the bu&s;ine&s;s was done, and he would tell him. Well, then, as &s;oon as the bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;hed, and they left the hou&s;e of the ju&s;tice, Cox artfully contrived to leave M'Manus and Caffry together, and he him&s;elf walked before with Bretz, without regarding Caffry at all. It was at this period that M'Manus made the propo&s;itions to Caffry.&mdash;They went on to Cox's hou&s;e, yet all that night Cox &s;aid not one word to Caffry, although he contrived the meeting, for the purpo&s;e, he &s;aid, of &s;peak|ing to him about &s;omething-or other. Surely then it is no my&s;tery what that &s;omething was. It could be for nothing el&s;e than to introduce him to M'Manus, and to give M'Manus an opportunity to accompli&s;h what he had in view.&mdash;But you are told &s;o innocent and free from de&s;ign was Cox, that he was taken up with his law &s;uit, and had forgot every thing about it, and it could not be any thing that would intere&s;t his mind. To us it appears conclu&s;ive, that this was what Cox de&s;igned; that he had no other views; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he did not wi&s;h to &s;peak to him on his own account; but merely to give M'Manus an opportunity to bribe him into a participation of the crimes which were to follow. You are further told that Cox could not have over|heard what pa&s;&s;ed between Caffry and M'Manus. Well, be it &s;o&mdash;what will be the effect of this?&mdash;Simply this; that Cox knew all that was going on; that the plan had been contrived between him and M'Manus before, to

Every other way of accounting for it is ir|rational and ab&s;urd. To a reflecting and intelligent mind the&s;e &s;trange cir|cum&s;tances, taken all together, mu&s;t furni&s;h the &s;tronge&s;t probable evidence, that Cox knew all that was about to take place; that he him&s;elf had em|barked in the villainy; that he wi&s;hed to draw in his &s;hip-mate Caffry; and that he him&s;elf was ready and willing to act the part a&s;&s;igned to him; and to take his &s;tation at Geiger's, for purpo&s;es which need not be repeated.&mdash;We mu&s;t therefore, now, trace him to the hou&s;e of Geiger. You have heard the ob&s;ervations made by his coun&s;el, in his behalf, upon the circum|&s;tances which happened there.

<P>When Geiger and his wife became apprehen&s;ive on account of M'Manus, and were afraid that his life would fall a &s;acrifice to the &s;everity of the weather, as he had gone out, in a very cold night, but thinly clothed, Cox appeared altogether undi&s;turbed at the circum&s;tance.

If he had &s;uppo&s;ed that was the only object which M'Manus had, it would have been more natural to have been anxious and unea&s;y about him, left &s;ome unlucky accident had happened to him. As a man, he could not have been &s;o reluctant to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the &s;earch for him. The real truth mu&s;t have been, that he well knew the errand M'Manus had gone after; and he knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all &s;earch would be in vain.&mdash;You have heard, when he did go out, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;earched about but little; that it appeared in him more like pretence; that he &s;tood aloof, and &s;oon retired, before the re&s;t, to his bed.

You have heard it as it happened. What it meant we can but conjecture. That the&s;e men have been concerned in &s;ome dreadful &s;cene of blood, we can have no doubt. Whether it alluded to a murder different from the one now trying, or not, we cannot tell. It is pretended that it could have meant nothing; becau&s;e Cox in the morning refu&s;ed to tell it. This &s;urely can prove nothing; becau&s;e in his cooler moments his prudence might have returned, and he might naturally have &s;uppo&s;ed that a di&s;clo|&s;ure would be attended with too much danger to him&s;elf; and the greate&s;t of criminals, remain until the la&s;t moment, under the hope of acquittal.&mdash;We have thought it our duty to lay the circum&s;tances before you; treat it as you think it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>We have thus briefly con&s;idered the evidence as it has appeared again&s;t the pri&s;oners, and have made &s;uch ob&s;ervations as appeared to us the evi|dence de&s;erved. We conceive that it is entitled to more weight than the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oners are willing to allow; and that it does not merit the many trifling epithets which have been &s;o freely applied to it.</P>

One of the coun&s;el has &s;aid, that innocence is as bold as a lion; and that the firm and undaunted countenance of the pri&s;oners indicates that their minds are con&s;cious of innocence, and that they are not under that dread, which is the con&s;equence of guilt.

<P>The Pre&s;ident of the Court charged the jury in the following manner:</P>
<SP>
<P>GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY.</P>
<P>The indictment upon which you are now trying the pri&s;oners at the bar, charges Charles M'Manus and Peter M'Donough as principals; and the pri&s;oners as acce&s;&s;aries before the fact. Charles M'Manus has been already convicted. But whether the pre&s;ent pri&s;oners at the bar were partakers of the guilt, as acce&s;&s;aries before the fact, you are now called upon to deter|mine.</P>
<P>The murder of Francis Shitz certainly rou&s;ed the indignation of the county. Its atrocity is unequalled by any thing of the kind hitherto known in Penn&s;ylvania. The execution of the murder was as horrid, as the mo|tives were ba&s;e and grovelling.</P>
<P>The keene&s;t &s;en&s;ations mu&s;t ari&s;e in the minds of all good men, and worthy citizens, that in a government of laws, predicated on the ground of freedom, where the &s;ecurity of our per&s;ons, and the protection of our property, are the primary objects of legi&s;lation, a ma&s;&s;acre &s;hould take effect that would di&s;grace the manners and government of the mo&s;t &s;avage people!</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="034040_0155_0FFA4C6D09840518">
It is proper, gentlemen, that this &s;en&s;ation in the public mind &s;hould be encrea&s;ed and exhilarated; to cau&s;e us collectively, and individually, to become more circum&s;pect in our ob&s;ervance of the conduct of each other, and more watchful of &s;trangers.</P>
<P>But, gentlemen, in the relative &s;ituations we now h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld; call|ed upon by the laws of our country to decide upon the life and death of fellow men, we have a different part to act.&mdash;Sitting as a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">iters of the fate of the&s;e men, we mu&s;t dive&s;t our&s;elves of all pre|judices we may have imbibed from &s;tories told out of doors. We mu&s;t di&s;|regard all apprehen&s;ions of ill-will from particular per&s;ons, or any dangers that may ari&s;e to us from popular rage.</P>
<P>Here occupying the &s;ituations of Judges and Jurors, it is a &s;acred duty, that each of us &s;hould permit his under&s;tanding to be ruled and guided ONLY by the evidence which has been laid before us; and THAT EVIDENCE ONLY which is acknowledged and received by the laws of our country as genuine, &s;hould have an operation on your minds. Evidence which the law pro|nounces to have no weight, though it &s;hould from the nece&s;&s;ity of the occa|&s;ion, come into the view of the jury, mu&s;t, when they are informed that it is legally ineffective, be laid totally out of the que&s;tion. Nothing, indeed, &s;hould induce a conviction in a ca&s;e of murder, but evidence legal in it&s;elf, fairly and openly delivered in Court. Pa&s;&s;ion, prejudice, and the rumours of the country, &s;hould be done away. Cool inquiry; a deliberate exami|nation and compari&s;on of the circum&s;tances one with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, with a zeal for truth, ought to a&s;&s;ume their places.</P>
<P>Here, I think it proper again to ob&s;erve, that the confe&s;&s;ion of one pri|&s;oner, though it names others of the pri&s;oners as being concerned with him in guilt, ought not to operate as evidence to convict tho&s;e other pri&s;oners. There is great rea&s;on in this rule of law. A man who has him&s;elf been guil|ty of an offence, ought not to be permitted to criminate another, in the ab|&s;ence of that other; and when the pri&s;oner, who makes the confe&s;&s;ion, may have abandoned all hope of &s;alvation here and hereafter; or perhaps becau&s;e he may have given him&s;elf up to a rage again&s;t the per&s;on whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> charges.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="034040_0156_0FFA4C6F078E6708">
The pri&s;oners are arraigned before you as acce&s;&s;aries before the fact to Charles M'Manus, who &s;tands convicted of the murder of Francis Shitz.</P>
<P>The law defines an acce&s;&s;ary before the fact, to be <Q>One who being ab|&s;ent at the time the crime is committed, does yet procure it to be done;&mdash;coun&s;els with another to do it,&mdash;or commands it to be done.</Q></P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute this offence, that the pri&s;oner &s;hould have been ab&s;ent at the time of the commi&s;&s;ion of the offence. For if he be pre&s;ent, aiding or abetting, he is then a principal.</P>
<P>A man may al&s;o be an acce&s;&s;ary before the fact, though he does not communicate with the per&s;on who does the felony. As where A. prevails upon B. to procure C. to poi&s;on or kill D. If C. does kill D. A. though he never &s;aw or &s;poke to C. upon the &s;ubject of the intended felony, is as much an acce&s;&s;ary, and is as highly puni&s;hable as B. who procured C. to do the act.</P>
<P>As to the evidence before you, I &s;hall recapitulate the prominent parts of it, as it re&s;pects each of the pri&s;oners as they &s;tand in order in the indictment. Having done this without comment, I mu&s;t leave it to you to draw your own conclu&s;ions. It is not the duty of Judges, in ca&s;es like the pre&s;ent, to pre&s;s arguments for conviction, which do not &s;trike the mind &s;o forcibly as at once to &s;atisfy of guilt.</P>
<P>As to Hauer, gentlemen, when you con&s;ider the te&s;timony relating to his malice again&s;t the decea&s;ed, and his brother before the murder: His beha|vior immediately before the death of Francis Shitz, and after, and all this accompanied by his own confe&s;&s;ion; you can have no he&s;itation but that again&s;t him there mu&s;t be a verdict of guilty.</P>
<P>As to Donagan and Cox the evidence is merely circum&s;tantial and pre&s;umptive. When this kind of evidence, unaccompanied by any thing po&s;itive, is brought before a jury to induce a conviction for murder, it ought to be received and acted upon with great caution.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="034040_0157_0FFA4C779F9DF2C8">
Though even probable pre&s;umptions, which may be drawn from a varie|ty of circum&s;tances attending a crime, will authorize a jury in any ca&s;e, whether of the highe&s;t or lowe&s;t kind of offences, to convict; yet as circum|&s;tances, particularly when few in number, are &s;ometimes uncertain and fal|lible, it is certainly prudent for the judicious and con&s;cientious juror to &s;crutinize all the circum&s;tances minutely. If upon &s;uch &s;crutiny he can fairly make the conclu&s;ion of guiltine&s;s, he ought to do it firmly and without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear of con&s;equences. On the contrary if he&s;itation and doubt remain, up|on contra&s;ting all the occurences brought before him in evidence, the juror &s;hould as firmly and fearle&s;sly pronounce the pri&s;oner not guilty.&mdash;It is an excellent &s;entiment of a great lawyer and a mo&s;t pious man, the famous judge Hale&punc; That in ca&s;es of pre&s;umptive evidence, it is better that five guilty per&s;ons e&s;cape than that one innocent &s;uffer.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Judge then went into a particular detail of all the evidence that had been given, with the utmo&s;t impartiality and candor. He told the jury the Court would make no ob&s;ervations on the evidence, but leave them to judge of it for them&s;elves; that they had heard the arguments and remarks upon the whole te&s;timony, much at large, on both &s;ides; and would decide for them&s;elves what weight they were intitled to; and if they did not think the evidence &s;ufficiently &s;trong to convict, they ought to acquit without the fear of cen&s;ure; but if they were &s;atisfied in their con&s;ciences, that the pri|&s;oners were guilty, they ought as fearle&s;sly to declare it.</P>
<P>Two bailiffs were then &s;worn to keep the jury together, in the com|mon form, and the Court adjourned, when the jury retired, at four o'|clock, on Sunday afternoon.</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t &s;even o'clock in the evening, the jury had agreed upon their verdict. So great was the public curio&s;ity, and &s;o immen&s;e the croud of people, occupying the whole pa&s;&s;age to the door of the Court-Hou&s;e, that when the Court went up to receive the verdict, it was with &s;ome difficulty they could get into the hou&s;e.</P>

Patrick Donagan and Francis Cox are &s;till in confinement, under the orders of the Court, till they find &s;ecurity for their good behaviour.

<P>On Saturday. July 14, 1798, at 12 o'clock at noon, CHARLES M'MA|NUS and JOHN HAUER were executed on the public ground in Harri&s;burgh, in pur&s;uance of their &s;entence. The deportment of Hauer was much more decent and compo&s;ed than was expected from his conduct &s;ince his trial and condemnation; during which time he was never known to utter a &s;yllable, although every exertion was u&s;ed which humanity could dictate or art devi&s;e. He per&s;i&s;ted in remaining in the mo&s;t indelicate and filthy &s;ituation, not ad|mitting the lea&s;t kind of covering to his nakedne&s;s; and attempting at every opportunity to bite tho&s;e who came within his reach: one per&s;on was very much wounded by him in this manner. It was generally thought his &s;ingu|lar behavior was feigned, as he had once before, it is &s;aid, e&s;caped con|dign puni&s;hment by a &s;imilar conduct. But whether his dumbne&s;s was real or affected, he was at lea&s;t con&s;i&s;tent, and &s;u&s;tained the concluding &s;cene with|out opening his lips&mdash;though without any &s;ymptom of in&s;anity. From whatever cau&s;e it proceeded, there is ground to believe that latterly he was really incapable of &s;peaking. Extreme terror has been known to produce this effect.</P>
<P>M'Manus, in his la&s;t moment, confirmed the te&s;timony he had given to the grand jury, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That he was not in the hou&s;e, or pre&s;ent at the murder; but that he held a hor&s;e at the end of a lane, in order to aid the e&s;cape of the perpetrators, who were, he &s;aid, Hauer and Peter M'Donough. He appeared with the &s;ame manly and even cheerful re&s;ignation, which he had invariably pre&s;erved during his trial and impri&s;onment; and which, added to his youth, had, notwith&s;tanding the atrocity of his crime, procured him no incon&s;iderable degree of the public &s;ympathy and favor. And although in every view, a ju&s;t object of the puni&s;hment he &s;uffered, yet the certainty that &s;ome of the partakers, perhaps promoters of his guilt, had eluded the hand of ju&s;tice, could not fail to excite an unavailing regret at the inefficacy of human tribunals&mdash;too often baf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">led, by the &s;kill of old and hardened offenders, in guarding again&s;t the means of detection.</P>

<HEAD>The following is the la&s;t SPEECH and DYING CONFESSION of CHARLES M'MANUS, who was Executed at Harri&s;burgh, (Penn.) July 14, 1798, for the Murder of FRANCIS SHITZ, as taken down from his own Mouth&punc; a &s;hort time before his Death, by the Publi&s;her, in the pre&s;ence of the Rev. HENRY MOELLER.</HEAD>
<P>As it has been u&s;ual with poor unhappy Mortals who are brought to the dreadful &s;ituation with my&s;elf, to leave behind them &s;ome account of their &s;inful lives&mdash;I have thought it my duty, in the manner, to made this con|fe&s;&s;ion, in hopes it may prove a &s;olemn warning to all Sinners and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e, who may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;pectators to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> Death.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="034040_0163_0FFA4C8DC61F5A30">
I was born at Enni&s;kellen, in the county of Fermanagh, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Ireland, of hone&s;t, indu&s;trious and re&s;pectable Parents: My father was of the Roman Catholic Religion, but my mother was of the Church of England&mdash;to my mother's per&s;ua&s;ion I have been mo&s;t accu&s;tomed which naturally produced an early partiality on her part towards me&mdash;and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a time has &s;he given me the be&s;t of advice, and often, with tears of affection, pleaded with me to guard again&s;t my youthful follies. But alas! how &s;oon did I forget her maternal in&s;tructions&mdash;for I had &s;carcely attained my four|teenth year, before I began to form &s;chemes for the purpo&s;e of &s;educing hone&s;t women, in which abominable wickedne&s;s, I have been but too often &s;ucce&s;sful, both with married and &s;ingle; and have had three children laid to my charge in con&s;equence of this illicit behaviour.</P>
<P>At the age of fifteen years, I was lawfully married to Polly Brown, of a re&s;pectable family in my native country&mdash;She is now here, to witne&s;s the awful end of her unworthy hu&s;band. By her I have had one &s;on, who to the be&s;t of my knowledge, is now living, about five years old.</P>
<P>In July, 1796, I came over to America, and a few days after I landed, came to this county, and worked with &s;everal people, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Henry Grub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, George Illick, Jacob Whiteman, Michael Hoch, and George Calbach, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all of whom, I &s;trived my utmo&s;t to give &s;atisfaction by a faithful and dili|gent attention to my employment.</P>
<P>Although I confe&s;s my&s;elf to be heinou&s;ly wicked in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of God&mdash;and ob&s;erving the melancholy death that will &s;hortly be inflicted, agreeably to the laws of this county; yet, I &s;olemnly declare, in the pre&s;ence of the God, before who&s;e awful tribunal I expect in a few hours to appear, to give an account of all the deeds done in this life. That the Depo&s;ition which I gave to the Grand Jury in March la&s;t, was the whole truth. But I ac|knowledge that the woman I &s;poke of in my te&s;timony before Squire Car|penter, was not my wife, but one of tho&s;e females I had wickedly led a|&s;tray:&mdash;Neither was it true, that I purcha&s;ed the Pi&s;tols, as I have repre&s;ented. It was Peter M'Donough who procured them, as well as the large Knife and a Bullet Mould, in Lanca&s;ter.</P>
<P>I cannot tell whether it was John Hauer or Peter M'Donough who per|petrated the fatal murder; but after they had returned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me, where I was holding the Hor&s;e, at the end of the Lane, Hauer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me that one of the Shitzes had made his e&s;cape; however, &s;aid he, if he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not die with what he has got, and I am not put to Gaol for this, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hoot him, and if I am, my wife will poi&s;on him, which &s;he would have done long ago to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, had &s;he not thought it a pity for the Girl and two little Boys in the &s;ame hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Before I leave this world, I conceive it a duty I owe to Humanity and to my God, to make known, that Peter M'Donough, Hugh M'Donough, France Cox, and Patrick Donagan, were to my knowledge, aiding in the
<PB N="163" REF="034040_0164_0FFA4C925CDAB800">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> (for which I am to &s;uffer) equally with my&s;elf: And that John Hauer&punc; my fellow-&s;ufferer, has declared to me, that his wife Elizabeth Hauer, was al&s;o privy and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in forming the horrid deed again&s;t her brothers, as al&s;o his brother Solomon Hauer: And that it was &s;ettled be|tween him and Peter M'Donough, to de&s;troy me afterwards. The latter part of this information Hauer made known to me, while we were confined in one apartment together, and during the time he has behaved &s;o uncommon to all who vi&s;ited him, in order to appear in&s;ane: But in private, has often informed me how he would behave, in order to frighten the people into a bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ef of his lunacy;&mdash;and repeatedly declared &s;ince we have been confined, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> if he e&s;caped this time he would a&s;&s;uredly de&s;troy the &s;urviving brother, Peter Shitz.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o my duty to di&s;clo&s;e, for the &s;ecurity of my fellow creatures, a horrid Murder, perpetrated by Peter M'Donough, on his Uncle in his native country, about 8 years pa&s;t: The old gentleman was a Bachelo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of con&s;iderable E&s;tate, and betrothed to a young woman in his neighbourhood: Peter fearing this would be the means of excluding him from the inheritance, took the wicked re&s;olution to murder him, which he fatally effected, by &s;tabbing him in a mo&s;t barbarous manner, and afterwards threw the bleeding corp&s;e upon the fire, which burned away a great part of his head. He was cleared on his trial, by rea&s;on of perjury (known to be &s;o after his e&s;cape) of the principal Witne&s;s, named Molly Farley, in whom he has ever &s;ince been attached&mdash;and &s;he was to have been a principal Witne&s;s again&s;t him at the late Court&mdash;but has di&s;appeared, and by that means he has e&s;caped the &s;econd time, that awful ju&s;tice which awaits him.</P>
<P>I return my &s;incere thanks to the worthy Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, who have attended me in my &s;olitary pri&s;on for the good of my &s;oul; and tru&s;t I feel greatly relieved from the heavy burden of &s;in which has preyed upon my &s;oul from their ble&s;&s;ed coun&s;el&mdash;may God reward them for their kind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. I have received unmerited tenderne&s;s and humanity from all the Gentlemen of Harri&s;burgh, who&s;e pity has excited them to vi&s;it me. I pray them to accept my la&s;t thanks.</P>
<P>I can truly affirm I have never &s;tolen any thing in my life, nor did I ever cheat any per&s;on, to my knowledge, of the value of a &s;hilling. But I con|fe&s;s my&s;elf guilty of knowing and a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the dreadful and cruel Murder which I mu&s;t in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> alas! very few hours expiate with my own life! And I pray; my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> creatures, who may witne&s;s my &s;hameful Death, to beware of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that young and &s;u&s;ceptible minds are always in anger of. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> too much the dictates of my own de&s;ires, I forgot my religion&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> forgot my God!&mdash;And now clo&s;e my eyes on all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rthly things, and die in the prime of life, aged a little more than Twenty years!&mdash;in full hopes that my Heavenly Father, will accept my penitent &s;oul, through the merits of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who died to &s;ave Sinners.</P>
