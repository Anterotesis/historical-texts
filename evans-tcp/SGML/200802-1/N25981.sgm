<P>THE occa&s;ion of our pre&s;ent meeting is &s;olemn and affecting, melancholy but joyful. We are con|vened to celebrate the triumphs of benevolence; but we are convened al&s;o to the renewed exhibi|tion of the long, exten&s;ive, and malignant u&s;ur|pations of civil and dome&s;tic tyranny. Conflict|ing and tumultuous recollections pre&s;s upon our minds&mdash;recollections of all that renders man de|te&s;table and abhorred, amiable and illu&s;trious. We have &s;een an exemplary &s;pirit of ju&s;tice, active and indefatigable, animate the bo&s;oms of a few. The ju&s;tice, the humanity, the policy, the intere&s;t, of the en&s;lavers of men have been eloquently appealed to; but with partial &s;ucce&s;s!&mdash;A few have li&s;tened and reflected; a few have felt and acted; but the many have continued unmoved, have per&s;evered in the practice of their cruelties. Yet, &s;tartled and confu&s;ed, in the mid&s;t of their career, by the &s;ur|rounding progre&s;s of emancipation, they dread in|quiry, are le&s;s a&s;&s;ured of their future &s;ucce&s;s, and
<PB N="6" REF="034554_0004_0FFE273559AAE088">
have mitigated their &s;everity, or doubled their pre|cautions. In this &s;tate of the public &s;entiment, our duty is obvious and &s;imple&mdash;to pre&s;erve the vivid recollection of the enormities which mark the reign of oppre&s;&s;ion; of the efforts which have been made to &s;horten or de&s;troy it; of the motives which &s;hould compel us to proceed in this exalted labour: to di&s;&s;eminate the knowledge of them far and wide, to the young as well as to the old, to the en&s;laved as well as to the free; and, for our&s;elves, to act with gentlene&s;s but with firmne&s;s, with zeal but with prudence.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t ha&s;ty outline of the hi&s;tory of &s;lavery mu&s;t commence with the formation of Society: the hi&s;tory of man is the hi&s;tory of &s;lavery.</P>
<P>In the rude ages of the world, as in the mo&s;t refined, &s;uperior force and &s;uperior cunning have equally been practi&s;ed, and have both &s;ucceeded in en&s;laving one portion of the human race to another. What individual &s;trength and per&s;onal addre&s;s accompli&s;hed, in re&s;pect to one or a few, in the infancy of &s;ociety, has been &s;ince extended and perpetuated by multiform combinations both of power and art. Ignorance, and credulity and fear, the companions of ignorance, furni&s;hed ample op|portunity for &s;ucce&s;sful enterprize, where direct violence mu&s;t have been hazardous and uncertain. Mental &s;lavery, therefore, was of early origin and quick growth; it was a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivated; and the bands of &s;uper&s;tition re&s;trained tho&s;e who would ea&s;ily have &s;haken off the fetters of &s;ubjection. So important were the&s;e two methods of holding men
<PB N="7" REF="034554_0005_0FFE26FF88E44690">
in bondage to each other, &s;o con&s;entaneous in their principles, and &s;o co-ordinate in their birth, that, in the out&s;et, they were not infrequently united in the &s;ame per&s;on: the &s;ame per&s;on was at once king and pontiff. As &s;ociety advanced, the agents of this tyranny were augmented; a &s;eeming divi&s;ion of powers took place, while a real union was main|tained: to one party was committed the execution of their joint devices; to the other was entru&s;ted the more &s;ilent and &s;pecious diffu&s;ion of opinions favourable to their views. The fir&s;t &s;ubdued op|po&s;ition in the field; the la&s;t undermined it in the family; and while the king led his chiefs to combat, the pontiff, &s;urrounded by his prie&s;ts, inve&s;ted with the &s;ecurity of inviolable &s;anctity, refined his cun|ning, multiplied his wiles, and at length &s;ucceeded in &s;ubjugating the prince as well as the people. This was &s;ometimes a delicate ta&s;k; but the fear which even the mo&s;t powerful de&s;pots entertain of their &s;laves, favoured the &s;acerdotal u&s;urpation; and they were held by intere&s;t who &s;ecretly derided the preten&s;ions of the prelacy.</P>
<P>As the &s;tate of &s;ociety improved, the cultivators of &s;uper&s;tition &s;ubtilized and perfected their arts. They &s;aw and obeyed the nece&s;&s;ity of governing le&s;s in appearance, while they redoubled their ex|ertions, by converting to their aid all the errors of judgment, all the violences of pa&s;&s;ion, and all the phenomena of nature, to hold an ampler tyranny over the minds of men. Unable ab&s;olutely to im|pede the progre&s;s of knowledge, they laboured to di&s;tort it to their own purpo&s;es; or, failing of &s;uc|ce&s;s,
<PB N="8" REF="034554_0006_0FFE2736DDEE0878">
impo&s;ed a more powerful ob&s;tacle, by exert|ing their influence for the de&s;truction of the in|tractable &s;overeign, and enlightened philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>While nations were exclu&s;ively ruled by the prie&s;thood, or by tyrants who united in their own per&s;ons the offices of monarch and high-prie&s;t, no &s;afe means of obtaining and con&s;olidating authori|ty were neglected. Afterwards, upon a &s;eparation of the two functions of en&s;laving the bodies and &s;ubjugating the minds of men, the leaders of opi|nion &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported all the outrages of the de&s;pot who was &s;ub&s;ervient to their wi&s;hes; and, whether he ground with the iron edge of oppre&s;&s;ion his own &s;ubjects, or the &s;ubjects of another, whe|ther his capricious frenzy doomed his own territo|ries, or the dominions of a neighbouring prince, to de&s;olation, alike &s;u&s;tained his fury and panegy|rized his inju&s;tice. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, is it wonderful that &s;lavery became widely diffu&s;ed; that the &s;word and the robe alone were deemed worthy the ambition of the great; that all the arts which nouri&s;h and ble&s;s mankind were de&s;pi&s;ed as &s;ervile; that men became the wor&s;hippers of men, and eagerly acknowledged them&s;elves the &s;ervants of one, that they might more &s;ecurely tyrannize over many.</P>
<P>Nor was this &s;tate of things limited to monar|chies. Forms of government rather varied the ap|plication of the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, than de&s;troyed it. If the citizens of States denominated free, were le&s;s &s;ervile in their demeanour towards tho&s;e who were at any time entru&s;ted with authority, they
<PB N="9" REF="034554_0007_0FFE27026F7C4FA0">
were not the more di&s;po&s;ed to relinqui&s;h their do|minion over the per&s;ons and minds of tho&s;e whom they had &s;ubdued, by &s;tealth, or artifice, or con|que&s;t, to their plea&s;ure. The &s;ubjects of the Great King, indeed, pro&s;trated them&s;elves in <HI>his</HI> pre|&s;ence, whom they might now &s;upplant, now flatter to accompli&s;h their de&s;igns; but the frigid &s;oldiery of Sparta, and the fickle citizens of Athens, held, with combined watchfulne&s;s, their numerous &s;laves in hopele&s;s &s;ubjection. Here, &s;till more than in the voluptuous capitals of the Ea&s;t, all mechanic arts were deemed ba&s;e, and the free citizen would have held him&s;elf degraded by the per&s;onal per|formance of any of the offices which contribute to the immediate &s;upport of life. Rome and Carthage were full of &s;laves, who&s;e condition was little dif|ferent from tho&s;e now employed in our own coun|try; and the mo&s;t illu&s;trious &s;tate&s;men and generals of all the&s;e ancient and celebrated Republics re|turned, through files of pro&s;trate &s;laves, from the delivery of their fellow-citizens, from the &s;ucce&s;s|ful a&s;&s;ertion of their own freedom, to domineer, at home, over wretches by nature equally entitled to liberty and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>If &s;uch were the conduct of the free&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing States of antiquity, in their mo&s;t pro&s;|perous days, what was to be expected from them when &s;unk and degraded by all the imbecility of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s and &s;loth, and all the vices of &s;tu|pidity and ignorance?</P>
<P>The dark ages, as they are called, were empha|tically the torpor of the human race; the &s;leep, in
<PB N="10" REF="034554_0008_0FFE27385FF06C10">
which every horrid and di&s;gu&s;tful dream tortured and disfigured the perverted mind. The introduc|tion of letters, from the Ea&s;t, into the new and ri&s;ing republics of Italy, effected but little for the general relief of &s;lavery. Feodality and &s;uper&s;tition bound in double fetters the ma&s;s of mankind. The invention of printing was equally without &s;udden benefit. The di&s;covery of gun-powder contributed more &s;peedily to this end, by equalizing the powers of men. And the reformation, attempted by others, but accompli&s;hed by Luther and Calvin, made a deeper inroad into this &s;avage con&s;titution of &s;ocie|ty. From this moment the foundations of &s;lavery were &s;haken. The pillar of the church was its proude&s;t column. It was no longer the &s;anctuary of the oppre&s;&s;or; and the ve&s;tibule of inquiry once &s;afely pa&s;t, nothing could protect the interior of the temple from the reiterated attacks of the keen &s;pirit of inve&s;tigation: its lofty turrets, and its ample walls, were de&s;tined &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to thunder to the ground. Thence forward, the progre&s;s of &s;ocial amelioration has been con&s;tant, though &s;low.</P>
<P>While the&s;e tran&s;actions were changing the face of Europe, the di&s;covery and &s;ettlement of Ame|rica opened a new field for the execution of every noble, as well as every baneful enterprize. What <HI>was</HI> done, need not be repeated. The melancholy recollection oppre&s;&s;es even us, who&s;e immediate ance&s;tors bore &s;o little &s;hare in the&s;e dete&s;table events. Scarcely was the &s;word of extermination laid a&s;ide, half &s;ated with the blood of its innu|merable victims, when fre&s;h crimes were devi&s;ed

for the cur&s;e of this new-di&s;covered world. A gal|lant nation, by who&s;e generous efforts their na|tive land had been re&s;cued from the long dominion of brave but hated conquerors;&mdash;a nation that had led the way in naval and commercial enterprize;&mdash;who&s;e empire, narrow at home, had been extended, by the vigour of its councils and the prowe&s;s of its chiefs, to the di&s;tant &s;hores of A&s;ia, of Africa, and of America, were the fir&s;t t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> violate the noble principles by which they had been guided in their own defence, and to commence the abominable traffic in their fellow men. Their example was &s;peedily followed by others; and they who had con|tended with the armies of a monarch, who had brought a king to the &s;caffold, who de&s;erted their country to pre&s;erve their civil and religious liberty, they were the fir&s;t to imitate this dark proceeding, and to engage in this abhorred commerce. The rivalry of &s;ome nations, and the avarice of others, multiplied and extended the evil; and while the con&s;ciences and the rea&s;on of the European pro|prietors of America were paralized, or &s;lept in thoughtle&s;s repo&s;e, African &s;ubjection and dome&s;tic &s;lavery were propagated, from the frozen bays of the north, to the icy and tempe&s;tuous oceans of the &s;outh. The di&s;ea&s;e daily increa&s;ed and gained vigour, while the patient was incon&s;cious of its progre&s;s, or regarded it with the &s;mile of &s;elf-con|gratulation, as de&s;irable and felicitous.&mdash;Negro &s;la|very was univer&s;al&mdash;and the conduct of it, at home and abroad, was wrought into a &s;y&s;tem, pur&s;ued with an unrelenting &s;pirit of enterprizing cruelty,
<PB N="12" REF="034554_0010_0FFE273E2FE3A4C0">
and maintained by all the force of watchful and &s;u&s;picious tyranny.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of the &s;ubject in the then Colonies of Great-Britain, in the United States, when an ob&s;cure individual of a derided &s;ect, &s;tart|led by a &s;udden conviction of the enormity of the crime, and the fearful con&s;equences to re&s;ult from its continuance, &s;ounded the alarm of for&s;aken ju&s;|tice and violated humanity, deplored the treachery of man to man, and denounced the di&s;obedience of mortals to the Immortal. The loud appeals of Woolman were &s;ucceeded by the gender, but more touching expo&s;tulations of Benezet. The fir&s;t was a &s;udden torrent, da&s;hed into foam again&s;t impene|trable rocks, yet &s;cattered over and &s;lightly moi&s;ten|ing the &s;urrounding &s;oil: the &s;econd, a deep, &s;ilent, and diffu&s;ed &s;tream, that percolates the &s;ands, di&s;|&s;olves the lea&s;t con&s;olidated rocks, bubbling and oozing forth through a thou&s;and pa&s;&s;ages and clefts, and &s;preading over and fertilizing an exten&s;ive ter|ritory. Encouraged by the example of the&s;e men, or awakened by their admonitions, new advocates for the oppre&s;&s;ed aro&s;e. But they increa&s;ed their own zeal more than they augmented the charity of others. Their &s;ucce&s;s was &s;mall&mdash;their advances &s;low. Still they advanced. The fears and jealou&s;ies of the holders of &s;laves were, at length, alarmed; and oppre&s;&s;ion, which, at fir&s;t, derided the feeble efforts of its adver&s;aries, and contemned them as the frantic revels of in&s;anity or folly, was rouzed into action, and animated into &s;peech. This was a mighty triumph for the cau&s;e of humanity.
<PB N="13" REF="034554_0011_0FFE270842023C88">
Truth and Rea&s;on are all-powerful if they gain an audience. The arguments of Fal&s;ehood are op|po&s;ed to them, as cobwebs in the hands of Samp|&s;on. To have obtained a parley with their adver|&s;ary, is to have half atchieved a victory. The par|ley has been obtained; the conferences have been carried on with ardour; the enemy have maintain|ed their ground with ob&s;tinacy; but they are every where foiled and beaten down; they are driven to their la&s;t &s;ubterfuges; and victory begins to in|cline the balance of final &s;uperiority on the &s;ide of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The holders of &s;laves, in the out&s;et of the con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t, ventured to place their defence on the ground of <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI> The rights of conque&s;t, the denuncia|tions of Jehovah, and the claims of &s;uperior intel|lect, were &s;everally and conjointly urged in their behalf. They purcha&s;ed the victims of un&s;ucce&s;s|ful war of their victorious ma&s;ters; they obeyed the prophetic voice of Heaven, whether they &s;ub|jugated the accur&s;ed &s;eed of Cain, di&s;tingui&s;hed from the righteous progeny of Seth, by their me|lancholy hue, or &s;ubdued to &s;ervants [them&s;elves the children of Japhet, dwelling in the tents of Shem,] the offspring of degenerate Ham; they but exerci&s;ed the authority with which they were inve&s;ted, when to man was given dominion over the bea&s;ts of the field, the fowls of the air, and all things el&s;e which have life and motion.&mdash;They forgot that war, but in &s;elf-defence, that ho&s;tile incur&s;ion, was alike a violation of ju&s;tice, whether covered with defeat, or crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; that
<PB N="14" REF="034554_0012_0FFE273FB2EC1A30">
men born to equal rights, though they might for|feit them by crime, could not be deprived of them by force; that no claim could be founded on the infraction of right; and they concealed, or hoped to conceal, the odious cau&s;e of tho&s;e conque&s;ts on which they built their preten&s;ions, &s;ince that cau&s;e exi&s;ted in their own inju&s;tice, in their own avarice of oppre&s;&s;ion. They forgot that the &s;ame Jehovah who inflicted puni&s;hment on the fir&s;t fratricide, did not extend it to his offspring; and that the mark which di&s;tingui&s;hed him from men was a token of mercy. They forgot that the cur&s;e was limited to the lineal de&s;cendants of one of the children of the brutal &s;on of Noah; that no indu&s;try could trace the connection between this &s;uppo&s;ed ance&s;tor and his &s;uppo&s;ed progeny; that, whatever might be the will of the Deity, in re&s;pect to any particular race of men, nothing could ju&s;tify another for inflicting unprovoked injury upon them; that the code from which they derived their pretended authority to en|&s;lave one portion of their fellow-men, declared all to be brethren, the children of one parent, the par|takers of the &s;ame inheritance; that he whom they acknowledged as their Saviour, proclaimed him&s;elf equally the &s;aviour of all men; and that, the future de&s;tiny of all being the &s;ame, they were unequivo|cally entitled to the &s;ame pre&s;ent advantages. They forgot that the differences in the talents and erudi|tion of men aro&s;e &s;imply from external circum&s;tan|ces; that the &s;ame cour&s;e or &s;pecies of events which now elevated the inhabitants of Europe and their de&s;cendants to the &s;ummit of political pre-eminence,

formerly as much di&s;tingui&s;hed the progenitors of their unhappy &s;laves from the re&s;t of mankind; that the cradle of the &s;ciences was in Africa, and their fir&s;t nur&s;lings, and their earlie&s;t fathers, Africans.&mdash;All this they forgot&mdash;but they were reminded of it; they were &s;ilent, but they were not a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>Their new plea was founded on <HI>Humanity,</HI>&mdash;O impudence of vice!&mdash;on that humanity by them &s;o violated and trampled on. They removed ignorant and unhappy beings, from regions of barbari&s;m and &s;uper&s;tition, to countries enlightened by knowledge and adorned with arts. They brought them to a chri&s;tian country, where the true God was acknow|ledged and wor&s;hipped, where his ordinances were promulgated and explained, and where acce&s;s was ea&s;y to the only means of a virtuous pre&s;ent and happy future life. Here, fed, clothed, in&s;tructed in numerous arts, and with opportunities for religious improvement, how much better their condition than in their native realms!&mdash;Gentle preachers of humanity! generous in&s;tructors of the &s;avage and the ignorant! It was for this, then, that ye cro&s;&s;ed &s;eas and oceans, braving innumerable toils and dangers; for this that ye excited murderous wars between peaceful and friendly neighbours; for this that ye tore away, &s;undering them from their native country, from each other, whole tribes,&mdash;parents and children, hu&s;band and wife, the infirm and the hardy,&mdash;ma&s;&s;acreing perhaps, or leaving to peri&s;h, the aged and the little one; for this that ye bound them with iron, pre&s;&s;ed them like bales of cloth together into the &s;ame hold, without di&s;tinc|tion
<PB N="15" REF="034554_0014_0FFE274137D9B2F0">
of &s;ex,&mdash;excluding them from light and air; for this that ye hurried them to frozen, or to burn|ing regions, &s;courged them to ince&s;&s;ant toil, and tortured them into unre&s;i&s;ting &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; it was for this that all the&s;e exertions were made, and &s;o long continued&mdash;in obedience to the impul&s;es of humanity, and the injunctions of religion. Hoary and hallowed apologi&s;ts for avarice and oppre&s;&s;ion! who con&s;tituted you judges of the virtue and hap|pine&s;s of others? who authorized your forcible in|terference in their concerns? who made you arbi|ters of their de&s;tiny? Had ye gone to them in &s;implicity and truth, with love in your hearts, be|nevolence in your a&s;pects, full of kindne&s;s, and full of in&s;truction; had you won them by an indefati|gable and di&s;intere&s;ted zeal in their behalf, &s;ubdu|ed them by the parental tenderne&s;s of your con|duct, and taught them to reverence you for the purity of your lives; had you charmed them to peace, and led them to the ample &s;ource of know|ledge, converting their country into a garden, and them&s;elves into &s;ocial and refined beings; then might ye have talked of humanity; then might ye have boa&s;ted of the &s;incerity of your devotion. But ye have been as tigers and as wolves. Ye have en|tered the tents of Africa as hyaenas; and the whole land is devoted to carnage; is wa&s;te and de&s;olate.</P>
<P>It was madne&s;s that dictated the plea of huma|nity in favour of the oppre&s;&s;ors of the Africans. The &s;ubtiler &s;pirits of tho&s;e who had been le&s;s ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;helter their conduct under the pre|text of religion, &s;ugge&s;ted the more obvious and

more complex ju&s;tification of <HI>Policy.</HI> They cited the example of all former nations. Among them, whether governed by one, the few, or the many, &s;lavery univer&s;ally obtained. It &s;ecured the thrones of princes; it occa&s;ionally might protect the ari&s;to|cracy again&s;t encroachments; it delivered the citi|zen from &s;ervile labour, free to the care of govern|ment, the cultivation of &s;cience, the pur&s;uit of gain, and the exten&s;ion of his country's power. In all, it fo&s;tered and unyielding &s;pirit again&s;t foreign &s;ub|jection; and it generated or increa&s;ed the pa&s;&s;ion, while it provided the means, for the accompli&s;h|ment of &s;chemes of aggrandizement and glory:&mdash;the legitimate and only aim of the monarch and the &s;tate&s;man.&mdash;Wretched and feeble &s;ophi&s;try! what, are we to be bound by the mi&s;erable example of others, or &s;hall we be permitted to take coun&s;el with our rea&s;on? But, are they not coincident in warning us again&s;t the policy propo&s;ed? Whether we regard the political or the &s;ocial condition of the States that have authorized &s;lavery, whether we con&s;ider its effects on their happine&s;s or their power, the con|clu&s;ion is equally again&s;t it. The &s;afety and du|rable felicity of a government depend ab&s;olutely on the attachment of its &s;ubjects or citizens; and at|tachment can only be founded on a &s;en&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ings it confers. Power can never be &s;teadily maintained, nor effectually exerci&s;ed, for a long period, but from the united exertions of a whole nation. This union mu&s;t flow from mutual con|fidence, of the people and the government, of the citizens in each other. The only &s;olid ba&s;is of

Nations, indeed, may exi&s;t for a time; they may enjoy a temporary &s;ucce&s;s, while they di&s;regard the dictates of ju&s;tice, and trample on the rights of half mankind: a de|vouring fire may &s;uddenly bur&s;t forth and pro&s;trate the neighbouring fore&s;ts; a tornado may deva&s;tate a wide extent of harve&s;t; an unexpected &s;well of the ocean may lay wa&s;te the labours and overwhelm the habitations of men: but, as in the natural, &s;o in the political or moral world, all the&s;e violent agi|tations are of &s;hort duration. They even contain the elements of their own de&s;truction, or the re|compence for their own fury. The degree of power is dimini&s;hed with its extent, as its &s;ecurity is by its inju&s;tice; and as no nation has hitherto attempt|ed to obtain univer&s;al dominion on equitable prin|ciples, &s;o none has hitherto been able to pre&s;erve what little it has gained. Contemptible and ab|horred is that policy which, whether it aim by ge|neral or dome&s;tic &s;ubjection to &s;ecure preponderat|ing influence and authority, &s;acrifices on the altars of avarice and ambition public virtue and private happine&s;s.

By introducing &s;laves, we do but &s;ecure this by other means than are nece&s;&s;ary in more fortunate regions.

<P>The fate of the practice of oppre&s;&s;ion has been &s;imilar to that of every other vice: the more it has been inve&s;tigated, the le&s;s defen&s;ible, the more odi|ous has it appeared.

have re&s;orted to another.&mdash;We admit, &s;ay they, that &s;lavery is unju&s;t, abominable; an outrage on humanity; contrary to all &s;ound maxims of policy; and ho&s;tile to the intere&s;ts of a people: but, then, what &s;hall we do? Mo&s;t &s;incerely do we wi&s;h that this cur&s;e had never vi&s;ited our country.

In fact, the very motives urged here for the continuance of &s;lavery, are tho&s;e which mo&s;t forcibly demand its abolition.

This may be done without materi|ally affecting &s;lavery. At lea&s;t, <HI>here</HI> it may be done.

<P>It was Agathocles, I think, who, when the vic|torious arms of Carthage threatened Sicily with &s;ubjugation, &s;uddenly withdrew from its defence, and led his &s;oldiers into Africa, into the country of his enemies.

<P>It certainly de&s;erves to be numbered among the &s;ingular contrivances of minds immer&s;ed in error, that, in the cour&s;e and progre&s;s of the contention between the &s;upporters of &s;lavery and the advocates of ju&s;tice and humanity, the fir&s;t, after ample ac|knowledgments of the weakne&s;s of their cau&s;e in the enumerated particulars, &s;hould, at length, come to retort the charge of <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> on the la&s;t.

The mo|ment that the &s;lave-holder acknowledged the inju&s;|tice of &s;lavery, that moment the &s;low, but certain, death-wound was inflicted upon it.

Will you, at once, de&s;poil us of that which we have purcha&s;ed on the faith of the&s;e regulations? Are you prepared, by a &s;ingle vote, and without any compen&s;ation, to de&s;troy &s;o large a portion of all our wealth?
