&s;et forth by each of the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions &s;ingly, &amp; when they are all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aid together, they expre&s;s it with &s;pecial Force and Empha&s;is; or, if we are to &s;eek a more particular Meaning of the&s;e &s;e|veral Expre&s;&s;ions; the fir&s;t may mean, that &s;a|cred Reverence &amp; holy Fear of the ble&s;&s;ed God, which ought to be found reigning, in the Hearts of all his rea&s;onable Creatures, in Connexion with every other Branch, of a pious &amp; religious Temper of Mind; and the other Expre&s;&s;ions may &s;ignify, the proper and genuine Effects of &s;uch a Temper, in a Life of Sobriety, Godline&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and &s;o it comes to the &s;ame Thing. Now, on Condition of their being re|ligious and obedient, of their fearing God and &s;erving him, He graciou&s;ly promi&s;es them his Ble&s;&s;ing and Pro&s;perity&punc; This we have in the Clo&s;e of the Ver&s;e; <HI>Then &s;hall both ye&punc; and al&s;o the King that reigneth over you continue follow|ing the Lord your God.

<P>The PROPOSITION obviou&s;ly contained in the Words, and which may be con&s;ider'd on this Occa&s;ion, is this,</P>

<P>This is a mo&s;t important Point, in which we are all mo&s;t intimately concern'd. Religion and Holine&s;s, to fear and obey God, and to be conform'd to his Perfections, is certainly, the mo&s;t excellent, the mo&s;t important Thing in the World: 'tis the Beauty, the Ornament &amp; Glory of every individual Per&s;on: 'Tis the &s;ure&s;t, &amp; mo&s;t unfailing, the only unfailing Means of promoting their true Peace and Comfort, their Happine&s;s and Well-being in this World; of making them Ea&s;y &amp; Happy in them&s;elves, &amp; Ble&s;&s;ings to tho&s;e about them: and 'tis ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Well-being &amp; Happine&s;s of all Per&s;ons in the World to come. The primary End and De&s;ign of all Religion, is, to re&s;cue us from the mi&s;ery and fatal effects of the Apo&s;tacy, to recover us to Holine&s;s, and

And it we reflect further; that the &s;ame glorious Being, who was the God of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and their King, is the moral Governor of all mankind; that he equally hates and ab|hors Iniquity and Vice all over the World, can never be the Patron of Sin, nor countenance Wickedne&s;s and Rebellion in any Nation or People; and that he univer&s;ally approves Virtue and Holine&s;s, and loves it wherever it appears; we may ea&s;ily believe, &s;ince all civil Commu|nities, are the Creatures of Time, erected in it, and will all terminate and end with it; and &s;o are incapable, as Souls, of Rewards or Puni&s;h|ments in the World to come; I &s;ay, we may well conclude, that God will manife&s;t the Ho|line&s;s of his Nature, and the Equity of his Go|vernment, by frowning upon and puni&s;hing, a wicked and licentious; and by protecting and rewarding a righteous and an obedient People, in this World.

This important Point may be illu&s;trated,</P>
<P>II. <HI>From the general Tendency and Influence of Religion.</HI> The great things of Religion are reveal'd &amp; &s;et before us, in the Word of God: And when we conform to that Revelation, and comply with the Demands of it; when we be|lieve and act and live, as God requires we &s;hould do in his Word, we are then Religious. The <HI>Bible</HI> is the compleat <HI>Standard</HI> and Mea|&s;ure of our <HI>Religion:</HI> There are indeed divers important Articles of Religion, concerning God, the Difference between Vertue and Vice, and our Duty and Happine&s;s, that are di&s;co|verable by the Light of Nature: But all the great Truths and Duties of Morality, are adop|ted by Chri&s;t, and incorporated into his Laws, are refin'd and purifi'd, and &s;et in the faire&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Point of Light, and rai&s;ed to their highe&s;t Perfection in the Chri&s;tian In&s;titution. The Bible then, is our compleat Directory in Matters of Religion, this is the &s;ure Word of Prophe&s;y, to which we mu&s;t all take heed, as to a light that Shineth in a dark Place. GOD him&s;elf is the Author of this Book; here he

When the Supreme Love of God, and of Chri&s;t his Son, and a fervent Charity &amp; Benevolence to Man|kind, are ever glowing in their Hearts, &amp; Re|ligion is planted deep there; This Sacred, this powerful Principle, tends to awaken and ani|mate all their Powers, to promote the Peace &amp; Welfare and Felicity of their People; to pro|tect &amp; &s;kreen them on every Side, to guard &amp; &s;ecure their valuable Rights and Privileges: This determines them, to a firm and &s;teady Adherence, to the Rules of Ju&s;tice &amp; Equity, in all their Admini&s;trations; and to that Plan of Government, which fixes their own Powers and Prerogatives, as al&s;o, the Rights and Pri|vileges of the People; carefully avoiding all guilty Reaches, after de&s;potic &amp; arbitrary Rule, on the one Hand, &amp; equally careful, they don't tamely &s;uffer their Authority and Laws to be in&s;ulted and trampled upon, on the other.

<P>II. <HI>Permit me, with all Humility, to addre&s;s my&s;elf to the Mini&s;ters of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>conven'd on this Occa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reverend Fathers and Brethren.</HI> We are not only Members of Civil Society in Common with Others, and as &s;uch, under Engagements to promote its Welfare, and to do this, in tho&s;e Ways and Methods, Religion dictates and pre&s;cribes; but, we are by divine De&s;ig|nation and Appointment, <HI>the Mini&s;ters of Re|ligion;</HI> and as &s;uch, under peculiar Obligations to advance its &s;acred Intere&s;ts. You will per|mit me therefore, on this Occa&s;ion humbly to urge You, as well as my&s;elf, to exert all our Abilities in &s;o noble, &s;o glorious a Cau&s;e;&mdash;a Cau&s;e, in which the Honour of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, and his Son JESUS CHRIST, and the pre&s;ent and eternal Well-being and Felicity of Mankind are nearly concern'd. The End of our Office is, to promote the De&s;igns of re|deeming Love, in recovering &s;inful, guilty, mi|&s;erable Men, to the Favour &amp; Image of GOD, in bringing them to a Life of Holine&s;s, and the Practice of all the amiable Duties of Obedience,

and building them up to a Meetne&s;s for the heavenly State. Sen&s;ible of our own In&s;uffi|ciency for the&s;e Things; looking to, and hum|bly depending on Chri&s;t and his Grace; anima|ted by a tender Compa&s;&s;ion and fervent Love to immortal Souls; let us <HI>take Heed to Our|&s;elves, and to the Flocks of Chri&s;t over which the Holy Gho&s;t hath made us Over&s;eers;&mdash;preach the Word, be in&s;tant in Sea&s;on and out of Sea&s;on, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all Long-Suffering and Doctrine.</HI> As our Commi&s;&s;ion extends to the whole Coun&s;el of God reveal'd in his Word, and is limited and bounded by it; let us keep back Nothing from our Hear|ers, that may be profitable to them, but <HI>give to every one a Portion in due Sea&s;on.</HI> And as we are <HI>&s;et for the Defence of the Go&s;pel,</HI> let us prudently, faithfully caution and guard Our Hearers again&s;t the Errors and fal&s;e Doctrines of a degenerate Age; and endeavour to con|firm and e&s;tabli&s;h them in the great and im|portant Truths of the Go&s;pel;&mdash;repre&s;ent in the Cour&s;e of our Mini&s;try, the whole Sy&s;tem of Chri&s;tian Doctrine, and the various Branches of it, in their due Connexion and mutual Rela|tion; and &s;et them, at once, in the mo&s;t natu|ral and ea&s;y, the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t convincing Light. We mu&s;t likewi&s;e explain and Illu&s;|trate, the various Precepts of Morality, and Rules of holy Living, and place them in their

native and amiable Light, and enforce them on the Minds of Men, by the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t engaging Motives; &s;uch e&s;pecially, as are pe|culiar to the ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel, than which, none can be more &s;triking and powerful.</P>
<P><HI>Reverend, Re&s;pected,</HI> You well know, 'tis the plain, &s;erious, affectionate Preaching of CHRIST crucified, and his un&s;earchable Riches, the Merit of his Cro&s;s, the Prevalence of his Interce&s;&s;ion, and the Power of his Grace, and the other pe|culiar Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, that are nearly connected therewith; GOD has been wont e&s;pe|cially to own and ble&s;s; and we may chearfully expect, he will &s;till own and ble&s;s to the pro|ducing of Faith towards our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and Repentance from dead Works, and all the excellent Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s, in Life and Conver&s;ation. And if we thus plant, thus water, (&s;till enforcing all our Mini&s;trations in the Hou&s;e of GOD, by the &s;anctity and exemplary Obedience of our own Lives) and GOD &s;hall plea&s;e to give the Increa&s;e; we &s;hall be the happy In&s;truments of promoting the mo&s;t important and valuable Intere&s;t of our fellow-men; of forming them to Loyalty and Subjection to Civil Authority, not for Wrath, but for Con&s;cience Sake; and to the diligent Practi&s;e of the various Duties and Vir|tues of the Chri&s;tian and Social Life; and &s;o of

rendering them u&s;eful and Ble&s;&s;ings to the <HI>Public,</HI> in their re&s;pective Stations and Places: and what is more, infinitely more; we &s;hall be the happy means of plucking mi&s;erable Sinners from the Jaws of Ruin and De&s;truction; of re&s;cuing them from the Slavery of Sin and Tyranny of Satan, and of re&s;toring them to the Favour of GOD, and of making them his loyal Subjects, and of rai&s;ing them to the highe&s;t Happine&s;s and Perfection of their Na|tures in the coming World. And when we con&s;ider the ine&s;timable Worth of immortal Souls, commited to our Care; the Danger, the amazing Danger, many of them are in, of peri&s;hing and being mi&s;erable forever; the gracious Provi&s;ion made in the Go&s;pel for their Salvation; and the &s;trict and &s;olemn Ac|count, we mu&s;t quickly render to GOD the Judge of all, of our Conduct in the Mini&s;try; ought not the&s;e affecting Views, to quicken and animate all our Powers to advance the King|dom and Intere&s;t of the Redeemer, in the World; and the Happine&s;s and Salvation of our Fellow Men? May CHRIST JESUS our divine Ma&s;ter, who purchas'd the Church, here on Earth with his own Blood, and being return'd to his Throne in the Heavens; has committed the Care of it to his Mini&s;ters; ever afford us his gracious Pre&s;ence,&mdash;make us wi&s;e to win Souls, and faithful in our LORD'S

Work, and crown our Labours with abundant Succe&s;s; that &s;o the Ble&s;&s;ing of many Souls ready to peri&s;h, may come upon us, who may be our Crown and our Joy, in the great Day of the LORD&punc;</P>
<P>III. In the la&s;t Place, <HI>let me addre&s;s my&s;elf to the numerous A&s;&s;embly here pre&s;ent. Be per|&s;waded all, to contribute your Parts, to promote the Welfare and Felicity of this Government, by the &s;erious Practice of Religion, in all the ami|able and important Branches of it.</HI> As You are Members of this <HI>Community,</HI> You are bound to &s;eek its Welfare, and to endeavour, in your Places, to advance its Peace and Pro&s;perity. Be it your fir&s;t, your great Concern to do &s;o, by a &s;peedy Reformation of whatever is ami&s;s, by repenting of your Iniquities, and parting with them, and by Lives of Holine&s;s, Virtue and &s;trict Religion. There is great Need of a Reformation: the Sins and Abominations to be found among us, are &s;o many and &s;o great; that we may well fear the angry Re|&s;entments of the <HI>Mo&s;t High,</HI> and the fearful Rebukes of his Providence: and how &s;oon it will plea&s;e the Judge of all the Earth, pro|vok'd by our numerous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, by our Impenitence, our Contempt of the glorious Go&s;pel, and the Means of it, to pour his In|dignation on a thankle&s;s Land, and inflict his
<PB N="49" REF="007230_0027_102B40D6D7C16008">
Vengeance on a polluted guilty People; we know not: be &s;ure, if You continue incorrigible and unreform'd, You mu&s;t expect, &s;ooner or later, that Wrath will overtake You; and that the de&s;olating Judgments of Heaven will light upon You. It infinitely concerns You, <HI>Sirs,</HI> that without Delay, You repent and return to GOD and your Duty. See to it, that Religion be planted deep in your Hearts, and that it has a prevailing, Sovereign Influence on your Lives;&mdash;that you live in the &s;teady Practice of all the amiable Duties of it; of &s;erious De|votion and Piety towards the ble&s;&s;ed GOD; of Loyalty and dutiful Submi&s;&s;ion to our Civil Rulers; of Ju&s;tice and Equity, of Truth and Faithfulne&s;s in all your Dealings; of Tempe|rance and Sobriety, and of Diligence and In|du&s;try in your &s;everal Callings; &s;tudying the Things that make for Peace, and the Things, whereby You may edify one another; and adorning the Doctrine of GOD our Saviour in all Things.</P>
<P>This is the appointed Way, and a Way which in its own Nature tends to promote the public Welfare &amp; Happine&s;s: and to this, you are all bound, mo&s;t &s;olemnly bound, as You have named the Name of CHRIST, and taken upon You the Profe&s;&s;ion of his holy Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="007230_0028_102B40D9ACCD67F8">
But to have done; <HI>Religion,</HI> not only &s;ub|&s;erves the Intere&s;t of the <HI>State,</HI> but the cor|dial, thoro' Practice of it, is the direct Cour&s;e, the only Cour&s;e, to &s;ecure and promote your future Well-being, and your Happine&s;s to all Eternity. If you approve your&s;elves to GOD the &s;upreme Ruler of the World, in the &s;incere Practice of Holine&s;s and Go&s;pel Obedience; and walk humbly, fruitfully and obediently before Him; This will be Matter of Support and un&s;peakable Con&s;olation to You, when You come to leave the Society of Mortals here on Earth, and to lay down your Heads in the dark and &s;ilent Grave; This will enable You, to look up with Confidence and holy Boldne&s;s, in that great Day of the Lord; when all the civil Di&s;tinctions that obtain, among Men &s;hall be no more; when all the tran&s;itory Scenes of Time &s;hall di&s;appear; when the Kingdoms and Empires of the Earth &s;hall melt away; and CHRIST him&s;elf &s;hall deliver up the Kingdom, to GOD even the FATHER, and GOD &s;hall be all in all.</P>
