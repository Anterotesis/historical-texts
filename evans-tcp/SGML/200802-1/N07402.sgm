<HEAD>The Author To the YOUNG MEN who u&s;ually attend his Mini&s;try; and, more particularly, To tho&s;e of them, at who&s;e REQUEST the fol|lowing Di&s;cour&s;es are publi&s;hed.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear young Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now before me a paper directed to me, &s;igned by a con&s;iderable num|ber of you; in which you expre&s;s both a full per&s;wa&s;ion, and a grateful &s;en&s;e of my friendly de&s;ign in preaching the follow|lowing &s;ermons: At the &s;ame time de&s;iring a copy for the pre&s;s, in terms at once too re&s;pectful to me to be here repeated, and too plainly indicating a &s;erious turn of mind, to permit me to deny your reque&s;t.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The paper here referred to, was &s;igned by about fifty per&s;ons of the younger &s;ort.</NOTE></P>
<P>I SHOULD, indeed, do an injury to my&s;elf, if I denied that my aim in them was, as you &s;uppo&s;e, "the bettering your minds and morals." And the manner in which you attended to them, when preached, together with your being &s;o well &s;atisfied with them as to de&s;ire to read them in print, affords ground to hope that, by the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, the fountain of truth, light and wi&s;dom,
<PB N="iv" REF="009440_0003_0F7490B988D16A70">
the intention of them will be in &s;ome mea|&s;ure an&s;wered. This agreeable pro&s;pect has much alleviated the trouble I have been at in reviewing, correcting and tran&s;cribing them; which would otherwi&s;e have been a tedious labor to me, e&s;pecially in &s;o cold and &s;evere a &s;ea&s;on. But if they are only a quarter part &s;o u&s;eful to you as I pray GOD to make them, I &s;hall be very amply rewarded.</P>
<P>IN compo&s;ing them, I mu&s;t own, I had no other &s;ermons in view as a model; which may, perhaps, be one rea&s;on that they are no better. They were written intirely from the &s;criptures, and from my own heart; of the latter of which at lea&s;t, they are a true, tho' imperfect repre&s;entation. Lea&s;t of all had I in view as a model, either the &s;er|mons of any bigotted devotees to particu|lar &s;y&s;tems of religion, di&s;tinct from the general and glorious one of the go&s;pel; or &s;uch cold, unintere&s;ting di&s;cour&s;es as hit the frivolous ta&s;te of tho&s;e, who value &s;er|mons only for an imaginary delicacy of &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion, without &s;olidity, without force or energy; without entering into the &s;pirit and importance of religion. I do not think mine the wor&s;e, for not being imitations of &s;uch as either of the&s;e.
<PB N="v" REF="009440_0004_0F7490BAA6A9ACB0">
The former are my aver&s;ion, as the illibe|ral productions of <HI>&s;laves,</HI> who de&s;ire to <HI>tyrannize</HI> over other mens con&s;ciences: The latter my contempt, as the &s;uperficial, in&s;ipid, empty harangues of vain men; which do not de&s;erve the name of &s;ermons. If di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit are adapted only to plea&s;e the ear and the fancy, like many of the modern fa&s;hionable ones; in|&s;tead of having a direct tendency to alarm the con&s;cience of a &s;inner, to warm the heart of a &s;aint, or to enlighten the under|&s;tandings of any; they &s;erve, in my opi|nion, to no better purpo&s;es, than tho&s;e of <HI>un&s;ea&s;onably</HI> amu&s;ing the hearers, di&s;grac|ing the places in which, and the per&s;ons by whom they are delivered, as frivolous, con|ceited declaimers; who &s;eek only the ap|plau&s;e of men, by their &s;ounding bra&s;s and tinkling cymbals; in&s;tead of de&s;igning to do good, by manife&s;tation of the truth, and commending them&s;elves to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of GOD. I mu&s;t own, I &s;hould be a little mortified, as well as greatly di&s;appointed, if any per&s;ons who are charmed with &s;uch lullabies and opiates to the con&s;cience from the pulpit, &s;hould think the following di&s;cour&s;es in any mea|&s;ure <HI>tolerable.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="009440_0005_0F7490BB399DDCD8">
THE &s;ubject is handled in &s;uch a man|ner as to give you a general, comprehen|&s;ive idea of true religion, with its advan|tages and importance: I mean, of <HI>Chri&s;ti|anity,</HI> according to my own conceptions of it. The &s;cheme or plan of the &s;ermons is very exten&s;ive: It opens a wide field, almo&s;t boundle&s;s on every &s;ide, and pre&s;enting num|berle&s;s objects to the view. Whoever looks over the contents of them, will &s;ee that they are not deficient in point of variety, what|ever other faults they may be ju&s;tly charged with. But, in this way of treating the &s;ub|ject, it was impo&s;&s;ible to handle any particu|lar doctrine or precept of the go&s;pel fully, or with accuracy and preci&s;ion. Had I pre|tended to handle the various branches of re|ligion here touched upon, in this manner, each &s;ermon would have &s;welled to a folio; and they mu&s;t have employed more years than I was days, in compo&s;ing and preaching them.</P>
<P>THE general de&s;ign of them, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to in|&s;truct the YOUNG, and, by the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, to form their minds to the love and practice of true religion, cannot but be ap|proved by all wi&s;e and good men; how much &s;oever I have failed in the method,
<PB N="vii" REF="009440_0006_0F7490BC13ED3240">
or execution. The in&s;truction of the YOUNG, in order to their being well principled, and acting a proper part in life, is a thing of the utmo&s;t importance to them&s;elves and to &s;ociety. This has, accordingly, been a fa|vourite, a principal object with &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t men, in their re&s;pective ages and countries. Three &s;uch per&s;ons in particu|lar, at once pre&s;ent them&s;elves to my mind; SOLOMON, SOCRATES and CICERO.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e, SOLOMON among the JEWS, had a very particular attention to the YOUNG, in his invaluable writings; a trea&s;ure more to be prized than millions of gold and &s;ilver. He him&s;elf informs us, and it is obvious from the mo&s;t cur&s;ory view of them, that their more immediate and &s;pecial de&s;ign was, "to give to the YOUNG MAN knowledge and under&s;tanding."</P>
<P>The &s;econd, SOCRATES, &s;o renowned a|mong the GREEKS for his wi&s;dom and vir|tue, is al&s;o known to have devoted his time and great talents, chiefly to the in|&s;truction of YOUNG MEN. Tho' he left nothing in writing, which is come down to us; yet authentic hi&s;tory gives us this account of him: And the dialogues of PLATO, his learned di&s;ciple, in which the
<PB N="viii" REF="009440_0007_0F7490BCCC5C5268">
&s;entiments and di&s;cour&s;es of SOCRATES are repre&s;ented, clearly evince the &s;ame thing. He was, however, in that &s;uper&s;titious, cor|rupt and idolatrous, tho' polite age, accu&s;|ed, tried and condemned as a perverter of the YOUTH of ATHENS; more particularly, as it is &s;aid, becau&s;e he taught them the UNITY of GOD; ridiculing polythei&s;m, with the numberle&s;s &s;uper&s;titions &amp; follies which time, ignorance and prejudice had con&s;e|crated, as the &s;acred my&s;teries of religion; i. e. in other words, he was con&s;idered as an impious <HI>heretic</HI> and <HI>bla&s;phemer.</HI> This it was, that enraged the prie&s;ts, the politi|cians, and even the poets of ATHENS, again&s;t that extraordinary per&s;on; and finally brought him, as a martyr for the truth, to drink the fatal <HI>hemlock</HI> in a jayl: A poor requital for &s;uch important &s;ervices to his country! But thus it is, that "the world gives;"&mdash;thus, that it often rewards its be|nefactors, of whom it is not worthy. And even the SON of GOD him&s;elf, was by wicked hands crucified and &s;lain as a <HI>bla&s;phemer,</HI> for a&s;&s;erting that the only true GOD was his FATHER; thereby making him&s;elf, as the prie&s;ts maliciou&s;ly accu&s;ed him, equal with GOD!</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="009440_0008_0F7490BDB055F660">
CICERO among the ROMANS, the third of the&s;e renowned men, the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of his time and nation, had a &s;pecial view to the benefit of YOUNG MEN, in di|vers of his admirable writings; particu|larly in that very valuable book his OF|FICES, in&s;cribed to his &s;on MARCUS. He al&s;o took great pains in &s;ome of his other writings, to expo&s;e the folly, &s;uper&s;tition and knavery of the prie&s;ts and augurs, and other &s;uppo&s;ed holy men of tho&s;e times; and to pre&s;erve both the Old and Young from the &s;ad effects of their delu|&s;ions and hypocri&s;y, tho' he was him&s;elf One of their <HI>order.</HI> He was, accordingly, accounted an <HI>heretic</HI> by them. And tho' he did not fall at la&s;t as a martyr directly for true religion; yet he fell as one of the mo&s;t glorious advocates for LIBERTY, that the world ever &s;aw: An honor next to that of &s;uffering martyr|dom for religion; and, in &s;ome &s;ort, the &s;ame thing; true religion compri&s;ing in it the love of liberty, and of One's coun|try; and the hatred of all tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT is evident, moreover, from the epi&s;|tles of the great apo&s;tle PAUL, and of
<PB N="x" REF="009440_0009_0F7490BE378F7708">
JOHN the beloved di&s;ciple of our Lord, that both of them had a particular atten|tion to the YOUNG, in their writings: Not to mention the many excellent di|vines, or other learned and good men, who, in later ages, have devoted a great part of their time, and their noble ta|lents, to the &s;ervice of GOD and their ge|neration, in this way. To &s;ay the lea&s;t, therefore, I have no occa&s;ion to blu&s;h, for having employed my meaner talents with a particular view to the benefit of my YOUNG brethren, when I con&s;ider the&s;e il|lu&s;trious examples: E&s;pecially, when I al&s;o reflect on what pa&s;&s;ed betwixt our LORD and PETER, when the former, the chief Shepherd, was ju&s;t a&s;cending to his FATHER and our FATHER, to his GOD and our GOD. <Q>JESUS &s;aith to Simon Peter, Simon &s;on of Jonas, love&s;t thou me more than the&s;e? He &s;aith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowe&s;t that I love thee. He &s;aith unto him, FEED MY LAMBS.</Q></P>
<P>WHILE others, who are rich in wi&s;|dom, ca&s;t in of their abundance into the trea&s;ury and offerings of GOD, for the immediate &s;ervice of the YOUNG, the
<PB N="xi" REF="009440_0010_0F7490BF02792208">
LAMBS of CHRIST's fold; I may be per|mitted, like the poor widow, of my pe|nury to ca&s;t in a mite or two. In which re&s;pect, I may al&s;o accomodate to my&s;elf, and adopt the words of the la&s;t-menti|oned apo&s;tle, PETER, originally &s;poken with another view, on a particular occa|&s;ion: "Silver and gold have I none; but &s;uch as I have give I you." If what I here offer, as my own, is neither gold, &s;ilver nor precious &s;tones; yet, I tru&s;t, it is not wholly dro&s;s, wood, hay or &s;tubble. And, mean as it is, I am already a&s;&s;ured, my beloved young brethren, that you will not de&s;pi&s;e it: Nor do I doubt, but that the infinitely good and merciful GOD will graciou&s;ly accept it thro' JESUS CHRIST, as &s;incerely intended for his glory.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid by &s;ome, that the&s;e times are very corrupt and degenerate, in com|pari&s;on of tho&s;e of our fore-fathers; and particularly, that the YOUTH of the&s;e days are remarkably light and vain, loo&s;e and profligate, both in principle and man|ners. There is doubtle&s;s always room, and great occa&s;ion in this pre&s;ent evil world, for reformation. I am not cer|tain, however, that the above-mentioned
<PB N="xii" REF="009440_0011_0F7490BFB6284200">
charge is &s;trictly ju&s;t: Po&s;&s;ibly they who bring it, may not "inquire wi&s;ely con|cerning the former times," or the pre&s;ent, when they think that tho&s;e were &s;o much "better than the&s;e." Be that as it may; yet I am per&s;uaded, the mo&s;t likely way to produce a reformation, is not to rail at the times, or to make &s;uch invidious compari&s;ons betwixt the age pre&s;ent, and tho&s;e which are pa&s;t. I have, therefore, wholly declined this kind of <HI>rhetoric</HI> and <HI>declamation</HI> in the&s;e di&s;cour|&s;es: Contenting my&s;elf with plainly tel|ling you the truth and your duty; and urging it upon you by &s;uch con&s;iderations, as are at all times proper. But if there is any real foundation for &s;uch a charge again&s;t the YOUTH of the pre&s;ent age, the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es will be &s;o much the more <HI>&s;ea&s;onable,</HI> and claim your attention accordingly.</P>
<P>I HAVE addre&s;&s;ed you in them, and en|deavoured to treat you, as rea&s;onable crea|tures. You will not, it is hoped, think it le&s;s incumbent upon you to &s;hew your|&s;elves men by your conduct, tho' but young, than it was upon me to treat you as &s;uch. To the many arguments and
<PB N="xiii" REF="009440_0012_0F7490C0777A87A8">
motives to that end, u&s;ed in the&s;e di&s;|cour&s;es, let me here &s;ubjoin, that a num|ber of you have been ble&s;t with a <HI>liberal</HI> and <HI>learned,</HI> as well as religious education; and, that the more is expected of you both by GOD and man, on this account. Take heed, my brethren, that you do not any of you di&s;grace your education, and bring a reproach upon that re&s;pectable &s;ociety the COLLEGE, who&s;e public hon|ors you have received, by a conduct un|worthy both of that and your&s;elves;&mdash;either by a vicious and profligate, or even by a low, &s;ordid and vulgar behaviour. In either of which ca&s;es, e&s;pecially the former, you may be a&s;&s;ured, that what would otherwi&s;e be for your honor, will, in the end, turn to your &s;hame and re|proach. I &s;ay this, you know, as your friend, not as your enemy.</P>
<P>THE great regard and kindne&s;s with which I have been treated by your parents, and the honoured and beloved people of my pa&s;toral charge in general, lay me un|der &s;ome peculiar obligations, not only to them, but to you;&mdash;to do what|ever in me lies, to promote your honor, your temporal and eternal good. If, there|fore,
<PB N="xiv" REF="009440_0013_0F7490C19A3050B0">
you &s;hould think my private advice on any particular occa&s;ion, or my good wi&s;hes and my prayers worth any thing, you may depend upon having them; the former, whenever it is a&s;ked, and the two latter without it.</P>
<P>LET me ju&s;t add, that if any of you, after hearing, and reque&s;ting the publica|tion of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es on chri&s;tian &s;o|briety, &s;hould conduct your&s;elves un&s;ober|ly, unrighteou&s;ly and ungodly in the world, in&s;tead of living as the grace of GOD which has appeared, teaches you to live; the&s;e very &s;ermons, and your own written, &s;igned reque&s;t, will be as &s;wift witne&s;&s;es again&s;t you: You will be judged out of your own mouths, like wicked &s;ervants; and condemned, as it were, under your own hands and &s;eals. God forbid, that what is now a token for good con|cerning you, and a te&s;timony in your favor, &s;hould eventually be a means of aggravat|ing your guilt, and inflaming your con|demnation! As my beloved brethren I warn you; at the &s;ame time hoping "bet|ter things of you, and things that accom|pany &s;alvation:" Being</P>

<Q>YOUNG MEN <HI>likewi&s;e exhort to be &s;ober-minded.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TITUS, to whom the apo&s;tle Paul wrote this &s;hort, but excellent epi&s;tle, is gene|rally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been converted to the chri&s;tian faith by his mini&s;try: And it is doubtle&s;s with reference hereto, that the apo&s;tle calls him "his own &s;on, after the com|mon faith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. i. 4.</NOTE>". Titus being a young man of great hopes, when he fir&s;t became a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, St. Paul &s;eems to have had a particular
<PB N="2" REF="009440_0017_0F7490C691397450">

It appears from divers pa&s;&s;ages in the new te&s;ta|ment, that Titus was a per&s;on of no &s;mall con|&s;ideration among the Chri&s;tians of that day, even before he came to re&s;ide at Crete; being deputed, &s;ometimes by one apo&s;tle or another, and &s;ometimes by an whole church, to tran&s;act affairs of great importance to the common cau&s;e of chri&s;tianity; which tru&s;ts he &s;eems to have di&s;|charged with great ability and reputation.</P>
<P>WHETHER Titus went with St. Paul to Crete, in one of his peregrinations, as &s;eems mo&s;t probable: And whether it was by his, or the apo&s;tle's own mini&s;try, or by that of &s;ome other per&s;on, that the go&s;pel was fir&s;t planted in that i&s;land, is not material at pre&s;ent to be inquired, or determined. It is &s;till evident that they were, on &s;ome occa&s;ion or other, both together at this populous i&s;land; famous long before that time, as the &s;uppo&s;ed place of Jupiter's birth; for Minos, its ju&s;t king; for its labyrinth, its hun|dred cities, &amp;c. It is now more commonly known by the name of Candy, from its chief city, founded by the Saracens; and at this day &s;ubject to the Turks. It is, moreover, certain that, at the time when St. Paul and Titus were together at Crete, there was a con&s;iderable num|ber of chri&s;tian converts there; who were, 'tis likely, part Jews by birth, and part Gentiles.

It is &s;till farther certain, that the apo&s;tle being about to depart from thence, left this excellent per&s;on, who had by this time acquired great knowledge and experience, in Crete, to &s;uper|intend the affairs of the church; to regulate things there, and particularly to ordain elders, or pa&s;tors, in all the cities wherein it &s;hould be needful. <Q>For this cau&s;e left I thee in Crete, &s;ays he, that thou &s;houlde&s;t &s;et in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. i. 6.</NOTE></Q> From whence it appears that the church, or churches of Crete, were not hitherto reduced to due form, rule, or order; mo&s;t, if not all the cities being de&s;titute of regular, fixed pa&s;tors, or over&s;eers.</P>
<P>AND here, by the way, it is natural to take notice of a groundle&s;s conceit of a modern &s;ect; to the people of which, however, God knoweth, I bear no ill will; and who, in &s;ome other re|&s;pects, are rather to be commended, than blamed. The people u&s;ually called Quakers, a&s;&s;ert that it was never the intention of Chri&s;t the "chief &s;hepherd", or of his in&s;pired apo&s;tles, that there &s;hould be a certain order of men &s;e|parated to the go&s;pel-mini&s;try; or regularly &s;et|tled and ordained as pa&s;tors, elders, or by what|ever other name they are called, in particular cities and churches. Upon which &s;uppo&s;ition let them, if they can, give a plain and direct an&s;wer to the que&s;tion, For what end it was, that the apo&s;tle Paul left Titus at Crete? This notion of the Quakers is, in &s;hort, diametrically

repugnant to many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture; and con|trary to the known cu&s;tom in the apo&s;tles days, under their own eye and direction, as well as to the &s;entiments and practice of all Chri&s;tians in general from that time to the pre&s;ent, the Quakers them&s;elves being excepted, who are but a novel &s;ect. The &s;uppo&s;ed novelty of this &s;ect would, however, be no &s;olid objection again&s;t it, if its tenets and practices were truly apo&s;tolic. For whatever bears this &s;tamp and character, has really the mo&s;t venerable antiquity on its &s;ide; in compari&s;on of which, no other, however gloried in, is of any con&s;ideration. But one need not &s;cruple to &s;ay, that our modern Quaker-&s;ocieties, meetings or a&s;&s;emblies, wherein there are neither any &s;tated pa&s;tors, nor &s;acraments, bear, in that re&s;pect, no re&s;emblance of the churches planted by the apo&s;tles, their companions, or their immediate followers. In all which churches in general, there were both regu|lar pa&s;tors, elders (or bi&s;hops) and deacons: And, in them, the &s;acraments of bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper were admini&s;tred; all nearly according to the pre&s;ent mode and practice of our churches in New-England; tho' I will not pre&s;ume to &s;ay, exactly &s;o in every circum&s;tance.</P>

PREACHING One; not merely to ordain others to that laborious &s;ervice, and to over&s;ee them therein. For, in the &s;econd chapter of the epi&s;|tle, the apo&s;tle proceeds to give him &s;ome direc|tions concerning the di&s;charge of that duty; and the regard which he was therein to have to per|&s;ons of different ages, &s;exes, and &s;tations in life; admoni&s;hing him to adapt his in&s;tructions to them re&s;pectively.

Thus it is then, that the elder women were to teach the younger the&s;e excellent things; among&s;t which are good Oeconomy, and a prudent, di&s;|crete and virtuous behaviour in their families; as for other rea&s;ons, &s;o particularly, le&s;t <Q>the word of God &s;hould be bla&s;phemed:</Q> i. e. le&s;t the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t &s;hould fall under the contempt and reproach of men, by rea&s;on of the ill conduct of women profe&s;&s;ing godline&s;s; whether old or young.</P>

The&s;e things &s;peak and exhort, and re|buke with all authority. Let no man de&s;pi&s;e thee.</Q> Thus ends the chapter.</P>
<P>AND from this cur&s;ory view of the chapter, we may form a good general idea of what the apo&s;tle intended in the beginning of it, by "&s;ound doctrine", and the "things which become it": <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> more e&s;pecially the plain, obvious, and in|di&s;putable doctrines of the go&s;pel, re&s;pecting the redemption of mankind by the Son of God, and his appearing in glory hereafter to judge the world; together with the practice of &s;obriety, righteou&s;ne&s;s and godline&s;s; tho&s;e duties, the excel|lency and the obligation of which, are in &s;ome mea&s;ure apparent from the light of nature, tho more clearly made manife&s;t, and more forcibly taught, in the go&s;pel of the grace of God; in the faith of which they are to be performed. And this account of the things which become &s;ound doctrine, may receive both illu&s;tration and confir|mation from the &s;ame apo&s;tle's fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy, written on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion with this

But, alas! how diffe|rent conception have many per&s;ons, concerning the go&s;pel, its great de&s;ign, and the things which become &s;ound doctrine? Are there not multitudes in the countries &s;ubjected to the papal tyranny, who think that the things which more e&s;pecially become &s;uch doctrine, are, telling beads, going on pilgrimages, cro&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, ki&s;&s;ing and wor|&s;hipping images; and other &s;uch-like fooli&s;h and abominable practices, many of which are directly contrary to &s;ound doctrine? And among the prote&s;tants, the reformed, are there not many, in who&s;e yet-depraved, and un-reformed opinion, &s;ome of the appendages, and the circum&s;tantials of religion at be&s;t, have u&s;urped the highe&s;t place and e&s;timation, as the things that more particu|larly become &s;ound doctrine; while the infinite|ly more important and indi&s;pen&s;able duties of morality are de&s;pi&s;ed, perhaps, as "weak and

Are there not many prote|&s;tants, in who&s;e yet-unreformed and depraved judgment, hardly any thing merits the honour|able appellation of &s;ound doctrine, be&s;ides the &s;ubtleties and refinements of &s;peculative men, re&s;pecting certain ab&s;tru&s;e, and, at be&s;t, very doubtful points?&mdash;Such as, One may &s;afely &s;ay, very few people can even under&s;tand, and fewer &s;till were, probably, ever the better for; tho' it is likely very many have been the wor&s;e: If not the wor&s;e, merely by believing them, yet by getting their minds &s;oured about them, and em|bittered again&s;t their chri&s;tian brethren, who were &s;o unhappy, or, perhaps more properly, &s;o hap|py, as not to &s;ee with <HI>their</HI> eyes.

It may not be ami&s;s ju&s;t to ob&s;erve here, that what is tran&s;lated young men, in two words, is only one in the original: the "young", or "younger", in the plural number, with a ma&s;|culine termination to denote the &s;ex intended; there being nothing be&s;ides this termination, to warrant the addition of the word "men," as in our common tran&s;lation: with which, how|ever, I would not be thought to find any fault on this account. For the original word is in general well enough rendered thus. Under this term, or the&s;e terms, [young men] may be comprehended all per&s;ons of that &s;ex, between children, and tho&s;e whom we commonly call middle-aged per&s;ons.</P>
<P>HUMAN life, or the age of man, has been variou&s;ly divided. One, and, I believe, a pretty ancient method of dividing it, is into four pe|riods; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> childhood and youth, complete, per|fect manhood, and old age. Tho&s;e who divide it thus, reckon the &s;tate of childhood, from the birth to fourteen years; of youth, from fourteen to about twenty five; of complete, perfect manhood; from twenty five to fifty; and of old age, from thence-forward till death; whether that come at the end of three-&s;core years and ten, or, by rea&s;on of &s;trength, not till four&s;core years; or tho' people &s;hould live &s;till longer "in labor and &s;orrow.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xc. 10.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>ACCORDING to this divi&s;ion of human life, you perceive that all betwixt fourteen and twenty five years, are to be reckoned in the cla&s;s of
<PB N="17" REF="009440_0032_0F7490D4B2AF8660">
young men. And as to tho&s;e who either a little fall &s;hort of, or exceed the&s;e years; they may yet well enough be comprehended in the text, under the denomination of young men. Neither the holy &s;criptures, nor moral di&s;cour&s;es in gene|ral, aim at preci&s;ion in &s;uch matters as the&s;e. It would, indeed, be no better than trifling to in|&s;i&s;t, in di&s;cour&s;es of this kind, upon the punctilio of a few weeks, months, or even years.</P>
<P>IT may be farther remarked here, that when, in common di&s;cour&s;e, we &s;peak of young men, we often mean tho&s;e that are in a &s;ingle &s;tate, or the unmarried, in contradi&s;tinction from the mar|ried, tho' SOME of the former are OLDER than many of the latter. But the apo&s;tle does not appear to &s;peak of young men in this re&s;trained &s;en&s;e, exclu&s;ively of the married; but rather to include both; tho' he might probably have a more particular view to the former. That he does not &s;peak of the unmarried by way of di&s;|tinction from the married, is at lea&s;t probable from what he had ju&s;t before &s;aid concerning the young women, as he calls them; [ver. 4.] &s;ome of whom he, neverthele&s;s, &s;uppo&s;es to be married, to have hu&s;bands, and children: <Q>That they may teach the young women to&mdash;love their hu&s;bands, to love their children. &amp;c.</Q> From hence it may be naturally inferred, that the apo&s;tle, in the next ver&s;e but one, &s;peaking of young men, did not intend to be under&s;tood of the unmarried only: E&s;pecially if it be con&s;idered that &s;ome of the&s;e, who have never entered into that &s;tate of life, which he &s;ays "is honorable in all," in&s;tead of
<PB N="18" REF="009440_0033_0F7490D573ADDBC0">
being young, are indeed OLD: At lea&s;t this is the ca&s;e among us at this day&mdash;However, as was intimated before, the apo&s;tle may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had the unmarried more e&s;pe|cially in his eye; as being, perhaps, at once the greater number, and &s;tanding in &s;ome peculiar need of &s;uch an exhortation to &s;obriety&mdash;</P>
<P>IT is accordingly de&s;igned to accommodate my di&s;cour&s;es upon this &s;ubject, more particularly to tho&s;e whom we commonly mean by young men, or the unmarried. But this, it is hoped, will not prevent others, the married, and even the aged of both &s;exes, from reaping &s;ome benefit from them. For, as &s;obriety, virtue, or true re|ligion, is one uniform thing, in which all per&s;ons, of whatever age, &s;ex, or condition, are concerned; &s;o whatever is &s;aid upon this univer&s;ally-intere&s;t|ing &s;ubject, if &s;aid with tolerable propriety, may be in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the edification of all in general, tho' it be mo&s;t particularly adapted and directed to "young men." But,</P>
<P N="2">2. IT will be proper to give you here, a brief explanation of the term "&s;ober-minded"; and, hereby, &s;ome general idea what that is, to which the apo&s;tle would have young men exhorted.</P>
<P>THE original word and its derivatives are u&s;ed, &s;ometimes in a more narrow or re&s;trained, and &s;ometimes in a more exten&s;ive, comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e. When u&s;ed in the former, they may &s;ignify, and are tran&s;lated, grave, cha&s;te, tem|perate; in oppo&s;ition to lightne&s;s, leudne&s;s, and an immoderate indulgence of the &s;en&s;ual appetites. They are u&s;ed in &s;uch a re&s;trained &s;en&s;e, even in
<PB N="19" REF="009440_0034_0F7490D6598A25A0">
&s;everal places of this &s;ame chapter; of which it is unnece&s;&s;ary to give particular in&s;tances. And in the like re&s;trained &s;en&s;e the Engli&s;h word "&s;ober," is often u&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT the original may well bear a much more comprehen&s;ive meaning. It may &s;ignify, to be of a "&s;ound mind" in general; to have an en|lightened, a well-informed and healthy mind; a mind rightly di&s;po&s;ed; a proper temper, a duly re|gulated will and affections, accompanied by a cor|re&s;ponding external behaviour: In oppo&s;ition to an erroneous, ignorant mind; a blind and de|praved, a carnal or fle&s;hly mind; a mind &s;et upon folly and vanity; a di&s;orderly, unruly will and affections; and tho&s;e evil practices, which are the natural fruit and con&s;equence of having a mind thus darkned and corrupted. The original word will very ea&s;ily and naturally bear &s;uch an ex|ten&s;ive &s;ignification as this.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">SOPHRONEIN, &s;obrius e&s;&s;e, &s;apere, vel &s;an&acirc; mente e&s;&s;e prae|ditus, SOPHRONISMOS, &s;anitas animi, &s;apientia. Vid. 2 Tim. l. 7.&mdash;"a &s;ound mind."</NOTE> And there is the more rea&s;on for under&s;tanding it thus in the text, becau&s;e the apo&s;tle, directing Titus as to his mi|ni&s;terial application to young men, &s;ums all up in this &s;ingle word, that he &s;hould exhort them to be "&s;ober-minded:" Whereas he branches out into &s;everal particulars, in what he &s;ays with refe|rence to aged men, aged women, and young women, in the preceeding context; and to &s;er|vants, in the ver&s;es following. From hence it appears pretty evident, that this &s;ingle word was de&s;igned to comprehend a great deal in it; in &s;hort, every thing, in effect, to which young
<PB N="20" REF="009440_0035_0F7490D6F16441B0">
men need to be exhorted. I therefore under|&s;tand it much in the &s;ame latitude and extent, that Solomon commonly u&s;es the word wi&s;dom, in his writings, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> as comprehending true reli|gion in general, both in principle and practice; allowing only for the difference of times and cir|cum&s;tances, or of the di&s;pen&s;ations which Solo|mon and we are under:&mdash;He under the Mo&s;aic, and we, the Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE next thing, and all that is farther ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be con&s;idered, for the explanation of the text, is the manner of addre&s;s which the apo&s;tle enjoins Titus to u&s;e, expre&s;&s;ed by the word "exhortation."&mdash;Young men likewi&s;e "exhort," &amp;c. And, what this implies and &s;uppo&s;es in it, may appear from the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) EXHORTATION differs widely, in the nature and idea of it, from <HI>commanding,</HI> impe|riou&s;ly injoining a thing upon another, or au|thoritatively requiring it, as a ma&s;ter may com|mand, injoin, or require any thing of, his &s;ervants. The mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel have no &s;uch autho|rity as this over old or young. Even the in&s;pired apo&s;tles claimed no &s;uch power; declaring that they had no dominion over the faith of others: And they particularly admoni&s;h other mini&s;ters, not to behave them&s;elves as "lords over God's heritage."</P>
<P N="2">(2.) MINISTERIAL exhortation differs, on the other hand, from merely <HI>reque&s;ting</HI> &s;ome|thing of another, or expre&s;&s;ing a &s;imple <HI>de&s;ire</HI> of it. One per&s;on may, in numberle&s;s in&s;tances, ex|pre&s;s a de&s;ire that another would do this or that,
<PB N="21" REF="009440_0036_0F7490D9D1B64958">
and yet not exhort him to it. For example, if a poor man &s;hould make known his wants to his neighbour, and a&s;k an alms of him, no one would call this "exhorting" him to be charitable, or merciful.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) CHRISTIAN and mini&s;terial exhortation implies in it, rea&s;oning, urging, and endeavouring to per&s;wade, by the u&s;e of &s;uch arguments as are adapted to touch the con&s;cience, to move the will, and to excite people to the performance of what is con&s;idered as their duty, or that which they ought to do; pre&s;&s;ing it upon them with earne&s;tne&s;s, and a proper pathos, as being of great importance. So that the manner of addre&s;s expre&s;&s;ed by the word exhortation, is a medium betwixt command|ing and &s;imply de&s;iring a thing; the former of which &s;uppo&s;eth &s;uch an authority as no mini|&s;ter of the go&s;pel has, and the latter of which implies nothing more than what a child might do as well as an apo&s;tle.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) THE u&s;e of exhortation, as now explain|ed, &s;uppo&s;es men, even the young, to be rea&s;on|able creatures; capable of under&s;tanding what is &s;aid to them; of &s;eeing the force, and feeling the weight, of rational arguments; and &s;o, of being influenced by them. No man, in the due exerci&s;e of his own rea&s;on, employs it in giving exhortations to irrational creatures; to &s;uch as are, in their own nature, incapable of being wrought upon, or moved by &s;uch means; on a &s;tock or a &s;tone, on the hor&s;e or mule, which have no under&s;tanding. The end of exhortation is to move, to incline the will, by offering pro|per,
<PB N="22" REF="009440_0037_0F7490DAAF301400">
intelligible motives and arguments to the under&s;tanding, or con&s;cience; as was &s;aid before.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) EXHORTING young men or others, to be &s;ober-minded, &s;uppo&s;es that they need it, by rea&s;on of &s;ome natural or adventitious aver&s;ion, or di&s;inclination thereto: At lea&s;t it &s;uppo&s;es, that they need further information; and to have mo|tives, or arguments &s;et before them in a &s;tronger light; &s;o as to touch their hearts, and give a pro|per turn to their will and affections. For there would be no room, at lea&s;t no occa&s;ion, for ex|hortation, if their minds were &s;uppo&s;ed to be already properly informed, and their wills, hearts, and affections under due regulation; &s;uch as they ought to be under.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) SUCH exhortation does not, however, &s;uppo&s;e that the great end or de&s;ign of it is to be an&s;wered, merely by its own power, force, or energy, independently of the ble&s;&s;ing and grace of God concurring. What it really &s;uppo&s;es, as was &s;aid before, is, a rea&s;onable creature, or a pro|per &s;ubject, a free, moral agent, one naturally ca|pable of under&s;tanding, and being influenced by rational motives; and, at the &s;ame time, one that needs in&s;truction and excitement, in re&s;pect of &s;ome natural or adventitious darkne&s;s of mind, or irregularity of the will and affections. But, whether the be&s;t-adapted exhortations that man can give, &s;hall be effectual in the event, to an&s;wer the propo&s;ed end, depends upon God. For it is not without his gracious influence, that the&s;e ar|guments will actually &s;o touch the heart, as to produce their de&s;igned effect; however rational or
<PB N="23" REF="009440_0038_0F7490DABB2D4EA8">
&s;criptural they may be. There is really no true &s;obriety, no good fruit, no increa&s;e, no &s;piritual harve&s;t, be&s;ides that which God giveth, even tho' a Paul planteth, and an Apollos watereth: As, indeed, there is not any fruit, any harve&s;t pro|duced even in the natural world, without his &s;ecret energy and ble&s;&s;ing, however diligent or &s;kilful the hu&s;bandman may be.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) CHRISTIAN and mini&s;terial exhortation implies in it, a kind, friendly and courteous manner of addre&s;s, in oppo&s;ition to a rough, haughty and imperious one. The apo&s;tle well knew, that it was by gentle and paternal treatment, rather than by har&s;hne&s;s, rigor and &s;everity, that young men are, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, to be made &s;ober-minded, virtuous and good. He therefore directs Titus to "exhort" them to be &s;o. The &s;ame apo&s;tle in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy, written with the like gene|ral de&s;ign with this to Titus, particularly enjoins upon him a re&s;pectful, courteous and obliging manner of treating all, both the old and young of both &s;exes. "Rebuke not an elder," &s;ays he, (by an elder, here, doubtle&s;s meaning an old man only, not a pa&s;tor or bi&s;hop) <Q>but entreat him as a father; and the younger men as BRETHREN; the elder women as mothers, the younger as &s;i&s;ters, with all purity.</Q> And in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to the &s;ame per&s;on, he gives him the following caution again&s;t a rough and ar|rogant behavior in his mini&s;terial capacity. <Q>The &s;ervant of the Lord mu&s;t not &s;trive," &s;ays he, but be gentle unto ALL men, apt to teach, pa|tient,
<PB N="24" REF="009440_0039_0F7490DB73C12928">
in meekne&s;s in&s;tructing tho&s;e that oppo&s;e them&s;elves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging the truth.</Q> The &s;ame great apo&s;tle appeals to the The&s;&s;alo|nians as witne&s;&s;es of the kind and paternal man|ner, in which he conducted him&s;elf towards them, when he preached the go&s;pel among them: <Q>Ye know, &s;ays he, how we <HI>exhorted,</HI> and <HI>com|forted,</HI> and <HI>charged</HI> every one one of you, AS A FATHER DOTH HIS CHILDREN, that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</Q><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Epis. Chap. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>THESE pa&s;&s;ages may help to informs us, what &s;ort or manner of addre&s;s the apo&s;tle intended, by the word "exhortation;"&mdash;how great a re|gard he had for decorum, meekne&s;s and decency, in the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel; and how tenderly, kindly and courteou&s;ly he would have even "young men" treated by them. If the&s;e rules have not been duly ob&s;erved by all mini&s;ters &s;ince; if ill-natur'd reproaches, revilings, angry invectives, and har&s;h, imperious menaces, have been &s;ometimes heard, in&s;tead of the kind voice of exhortation and gentle per&s;wa&s;ion, in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s and charity; it is not becau&s;e the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are not &s;ufficiently warn|ed again&s;t &s;uch a pro&s;titution of their &s;acred office and character, in the holy &s;criptures Be&s;ides: religion is a rea&s;onable &s;ervice. It requires in the very nature of it, an enlightened mind, a con|vinced judgment, the con&s;ent, approbation and love of the heart; as being in it&s;elf mo&s;t amiable,
<PB N="25" REF="009440_0040_0F7490DC5D0C8DD0">
the foundation of all true happine&s;s here and hereafter. And, &s;urely, this conviction of its excellency, this complacency in, and love to it, are not to be produced, either in the old or young, by reproaches, invectives, or an imperious addre&s;s, in the teachers of religion. In this re&s;|pect, very particularly, the apo&s;tolic maxim will ever hold true; <Q>the wrath of man worketh not the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God.</Q> And the&s;e rules of charity and decorum, my beloved young brethren, &s;hall &s;tand as a perpetual reproach to my &s;elf, if I deviate from them, by railing at, re|viling, or lording it over you, in&s;tead of "ex|horting you to be &s;ober-minded." But,</P>
<P N="8">(8.) IT would be a wrong inference from what has been &s;aid re&s;pecting this point, that the&s;e mini&s;terial exhortations may therefore be inno|cently di&s;regarded: Or, that tho&s;e to whom they are given, are at liberty either to receive or reject them, without any danger of incurring the di&s;plea|&s;ure of God. Exhortations that are founded in truth and rea&s;on, and are according to the word and will of God, by whom&s;oever given, cannot be de&s;pi&s;ed, or &s;et at nought, without guilt and peril. The mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are indi&s;pen&s;ably o|bliged to take heed, what they deliver as his word and will; what they exhort you to; not "teach|ing for doctrines the commandments of men." And if they do the latter, either knowingly and wilfully, or thro' a criminal neglect to inform them&s;elves what they ought to preach, great is their guilt, and great the condemnation which belongs to them. Neither, on this &s;uppo&s;ition,
<PB N="26" REF="009440_0041_0F7490DCF9999718">
are you obliged to believe them, or to regard their exhortations; nay, you are bound in rea&s;on, duty and con&s;cience to reject them. But, on the o|ther hand, if they deliver to you real and impor|tant truth; if they exhort you to what is accord|ing to the word and will of God; certainly &s;uch exhortations as the&s;e are, in their own nature, binding. I mean, they are obligatory upon your con&s;ciences: You cannot di&s;regard them, with|out acting contrary to rea&s;on, without &s;inning a|gain&s;t God, and expo&s;ing your&s;elves, hereby, to his righteous di&s;plea&s;ure. What tho' the mini|&s;ters of the go&s;pel are not your ma&s;ters, or lords? What tho' they have no authority to command you how you &s;hall conduct your&s;elves? What tho' they have no right to call you to an account, for contemning and di&s;regarding their exhorta|tions? or to harm you in any re&s;pect what&s;oever, as certainly they have not. Yet are you not ac|countable to God? Are you not accountable to your&s;elves? Are you at liberty to act unrea&s;ona|bly? Have you a right to reject the truth? the commandments of God? Are you without law to him? Have you, in &s;hort, a right to reject any exhortations that are given you a|greeable to his word and will, by tho&s;e who, in his providence, &s;u&s;tain the character and relation of teachers and in&s;tructors to you? or even by any other per&s;on? You cannot think you have any &s;uch right as this, to do wrong; or that you may "u&s;e liberty for a cloak of maliciou&s;ne&s;s."</P>
<P>IN many ca&s;es, coun&s;els and exhortations are refu&s;eable; or they may be rejected without guilt
<PB N="27" REF="009440_0042_0F7490DDB74B9420">
or danger. But this is only when they are in their nature bad, or indifferent, doubtful, or merely prudential. No exhortations of this nature, are binding upon the con&s;cience; but the per&s;ons to whom they are given, are at liberty to reject them, if they chu&s;e to do &s;o; yea, they are in rea&s;on and con&s;cience bound to do it, as to tho&s;e coun|&s;els that are po&s;itively bad; as was ob&s;erved be|fore. But when you are exhorted to be &s;ober-minded; when you are coun&s;elled to receive and embrace the truth, &s;ufficiently proved to be &s;uch; when you are per&s;waded to do what is in its na|ture fit and rea&s;onable to be done; when you are admoni&s;hed to fear God, and keep his com|mandments; in a word, when you are exhorted to do your duty, and what God him&s;elf requires of you; certainly the&s;e are coun&s;els and exhor|tations of &s;uch a kind, that they cannot be di&s;re|garded without great guilt and danger. They do not come under the head of indifferent, doubtful, or merely prudential coun&s;els; much le&s;s, under that of bad ones: But they are &s;uch as ought to have all the weight and influence of commands; even the commands of God him&s;elf. Such, in|deed, they are, in one &s;en&s;e: For God authori|tatively requires of you, what&s;oever you are ex|horted to, conformably to rea&s;on, his word and will, whoever the exhorters them&s;elves may be; and altho' they have no dominion over you, nor any right to exact an account of your behaviour, except in the way of &s;ober remon&s;trance, ex|po&s;tulation, and friendly reproof, if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="009440_0043_0F7490DE821A9300">
IF the young men of Crete had not "&s;uffered the word of exhortation" from Titus, but &s;corn|ed and rejected it; would they not have been ju&s;tly blameable? Without doubt. If you &s;hould do the like, what would be the con&s;equence? You need not be told? The obligation to regard and follow exhortations, depends much le&s;s upon the character, office, or qualifications of him that gives them, than it does upon the nature of the exhortations them&s;elves. Tho', as to the former, there is no evidence, nor even probability, that Titus was an in&s;pired preacher. He received his doctrine and directions from the apo&s;tle. If o|thers therefore, tho' the meane&s;t of Chri&s;t's mi|ni&s;ters, follow the doctrine and directions of the &s;ame apo&s;tle, of all the apo&s;tles, and even of Chri&s;t him&s;elf; will not their exhortations be as bind|ing upon you, as tho&s;e of Titus were upon the Cretian youth?&mdash;<Q>Judge even of your&s;elves what is right.</Q></P>
<P N="9">(9.) ALTHO' the term exhortation implies in it a friendly and courteous manner of addre&s;s; yet, certainly, it is not de&s;igned in oppo&s;ition to <HI>reproving</HI> and <HI>rebuking</HI> tho&s;e that do evil, when there is ju&s;t occa&s;ion for it. For, in the &s;ame chapter, the apo&s;tle enjoins Titus to do thus: <Q>The&s;e things &s;peak and exhort, and <HI>rebuke</HI> with all authority; let no man de&s;pi&s;e thee.</Q> Where you will ob&s;erve, that exhorting and rebuking are joined together; &s;o that the former could not be intended in the text, in oppo&s;ition to the latter. And in the preceeding chapter, &s;peaking of the gro&s;s immoralities of the Cretians, as even one of their own poets had characterized them,
<PB N="29" REF="009440_0044_0F7490DF50443EE0">
he immediately &s;ubjoins, "This witne&s;s is true; wherefore <HI>rebuke them &s;harply,</HI> &amp;c."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 1. 12, 13.</NOTE> In his epi&s;tle to Timothy, he al&s;o &s;ays, <Q>Them that &s;in, rebuke before all, that others al&s;o may fear.</Q><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim.

For, &s;urely, they were not to be rebuked be|fore all, or in a public, &s;olemn manner, unle&s;s they had &s;inned before all, or their crimes were notori|ous and public; as the common reading implies.</P>
<P>BUT it is farther to be ob&s;erved here, that e|ven reproof and rebuke, which are needful in &s;ome ca&s;es, and which may &s;eem to imply &s;ome|what of rigor and &s;everity in their nature; may yet be admini&s;tred in a truly friendly and paternal manner. And they doubtle&s;s ought to be given in &s;uch a way, if po&s;&s;ible, as to convince tho&s;e to whom they are given, that they are kindly in|tended for their amendment, and real good; &s;ince, otherwi&s;e, there is little or no benefit to be hoped from them.

AND la&s;tly, It cannot rea&s;onably be thought incon&s;i&s;tent with the kindne&s;s, meekne&s;s and gentlene&s;s of the go&s;pel, or of that manner of addre&s;s which is implied in the word exhorta|tion, to lay open the folly and danger of vice, or of di&s;regarding the word and commandments of God, in the plaine&s;t, fulle&s;t and mo&s;t forceable manner po&s;&s;ible: To &s;hew to all people, whether old or young, the guilt and mi&s;ery of a &s;tate of alienation from God, and of enmity to him in their minds by wicked works; together with the imminent hazzard which wicked men are in, of peri&s;hing in their &s;ins; and "warning them to flee from the wrath to come." It is not here meant, that this may be done by prejudging, or pointing out particular per&s;ons, as the heirs of wrath and perdition; which were indeed an a|bominable piece of arrogance and pre&s;umption; but, by &s;hewing in a clear and forceable manner, that the paths of vice and folly, by whom&s;oever trodden, are the paths that lead to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome per&s;ons, who profe&s;s to have a reli&s;h for di&s;cour&s;es upon the excellency and rewards of moral virtue, with exhortations to the practice of it; and yet do not well like to have the evil and danger of &s;in in&s;i&s;ted on; or the ter|rors of the Lord &s;et before them. This is what &s;ome people con&s;ider as &s;avouring of har&s;hne&s;s, &s;ourne&s;s and &s;everity; hardly con&s;i&s;tent with the meekne&s;s and charity which become the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel. Nor, indeed, will I deny, that the&s;e topics may be treated upon, not only in a man|ner that is very ju&s;tly di&s;gu&s;tful, but too fre|quently;

or to the neglect of others which are equally proper and u&s;eful; and are, at the &s;ame time, more plea&s;ing; yea, probably, better adapted to produce a good effect upon the minds of many per&s;ons. And, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, I do not envy tho&s;e men their particular temper, and ca&s;t of mind, who &s;eem to be hardly ever &s;o much in their element, as when they are thunder|ing "hell and damnation" in the ears of people, with all the mo&s;t frightful images and expre&s;|&s;ions, which they can collect together.</P>
<P>BUT &s;till, the&s;e le&s;s agreeable topics of per|&s;wa&s;ion, are in them&s;elves very proper and nece&s;|&s;ary: And the in&s;i&s;ting on them at times, in a &s;criptural way, ought not to be imputed to &s;our|ne&s;s, gloomine&s;s or moro&s;ene&s;s of temper; or to any want of charity and good-will. Is the phy&s;ician thought to be wanting in kindne&s;s, good-will or re&s;pect to his patient, for letting him know, in &s;ome ca&s;es, the nature and danger of his di&s;ea&s;e? E&s;pecially if, at the &s;ame time, he informs him of the remedy; exhorts him to u&s;e it, and to take all po&s;&s;ible care and pains, that he may re|cover his health, and live happily. The di&s;ea&s;e would be the &s;ame in it&s;elf, tho' the patient were not thus informed concerning it; and the real danger, very often the greater, for a rea&s;on too obvious to need mentioning. Is the pilot who, at a di&s;tance, ob&s;erves a ve&s;&s;el in a &s;torm, ju&s;t run|ning upon rocks or quick&s;ands, and likely to be foundered in a few minutes, thought to want good-will to the people on board, becau&s;e he gives them the &s;ignal of their danger, and directs

them to a &s;ecure harbour! Is the watchman that cries "Fire" aloud in the night, thro' the &s;treets of a city, to awake the &s;leeping inhabitants, le&s;t they &s;hould be con&s;umed in their beds; calling upon them to ari&s;e, and extingui&s;h the flames, &s;uppo&s;ed for that rea&s;on, to want benevolence to them, and a proper concern for their welfare! No one is &s;o ab&s;urd as to rea&s;on after this rate.

To have done otherwi&s;e, would have been at once a neglect of duty, and great cruelty.</P>
<P>WHY then &s;hould it be thought unkind, or ungenerous, in the &s;piritual phy&s;ician under Chri&s;t the Chief, to &s;hew to youth, or others, their &s;piritual di&s;ea&s;es? their danger of eternal death? E&s;pecially if, at the &s;ame time, he &s;hews the remedy, the means of obtaining eternal life, and exhorts to the u&s;e thereof. Why &s;hould it be thought an unkindne&s;s for the &s;piritual pilot, to warn tho&s;e of their danger, whom he &s;ees carried down the gulph of error and vice with a rapid cour&s;e; and ready to be &s;wallowed up in the aby&s;s of de&s;truction and mi&s;ery? E&s;pecially if, at the &s;ame time, he points them to the great ARK, and to a &s;ecure haven; where neither winds, nor waves, nor &s;torms can hurt them. Why &s;hould it be accounted a cruel thing in the &s;piritual watchman, to awaken tho&s;e that are

a&s;leep in their &s;ins, and every moment in danger of being con&s;umed in the fire of God's indig|nation?&mdash;to "cry aloud," and even to <Q>lift up his voice like a trumpet</Q>; exhorting them, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, to extingui&s;h tho&s;e terri|ble flames with the tears of repentance, while there is opportunity for it? Is not this the true&s;t charity? As was &s;aid in the other ca&s;es, he does not <HI>make,</HI> but only <HI>give warning</HI> of the danger, that it may be e&s;caped. And has not God enjoin|ed this upon all who are, by office, the preachers of righteou&s;ne&s;s?

When I &s;ay unto the wicked, Thou &s;halt &s;urely die; and thou give&s;t him not warning, nor &s;peake&s;t to warn the wicked from his wicked way to &s;ave his life; the &s;ame wicked man &s;hall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require AT THY HAND.

<P>IT &s;hould al&s;o be remembered, that exhorting young men, or others, to be &s;ober-minded, mu&s;t, by natural and ju&s;t implication intend, u&s;ing all arguments and motives that are pro|per to that end. And therefore, &s;uch as the la&s;t-mentioned, mu&s;t not, cannot be omitted; tho'

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MY beloved young brethren of this Society, having a de&s;ign to adapt a number of di&s;cour&s;es particularly to your &s;ervice, as a mark of the re&s;pect and good-will which I bear to you, as well as from a regard to my duty more immediately to God, who&s;e I am, and whom I &s;erve with my &s;pirit, tho' in weakne&s;s: I thought I might very properly make the&s;e words of the apo&s;tle Paul to Titus, the &s;ubject of my intended di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="009440_0051_0F7490E6BB8751A0">
IN the morning I made &s;ome remarks on Titus and the Epi&s;tle to him; on the terms "young men", and "&s;ober-minded"; and then con&s;idered, more particularly, what that manner of addre&s;s implies in it, which is expre&s;&s;ed in the text by the word "exhortation". The&s;e &s;everal ob&s;ervations were de&s;igned only as intro|ductory to my main de&s;ign; which was exhibi|ted in the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e, under four gene|ral heads. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, to which I &s;hall now proceed without farther preface, was,</P>
<P>FIRST, By divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;omewhat di&s;|tinctly to explain to you the nature of that &s;o|briety, which is &s;poken of in the text; and to recommend it to you in a cur&s;ory way.</P>
<P>BUT, let me here ju&s;t remind you of &s;ome|thing ob&s;erved in the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e; that the original Greek word, tho' perhaps mo&s;t com|monly u&s;ed in a re&s;trained &s;en&s;e, to &s;ignify being grave, cha&s;te, temperate or moderate, yet ea&s;ily and naturally admits a very exten&s;ive meaning. It may comprehend all that is commonly inten|ded in the writings of Solomon, by "wi&s;dom"; i. e. true religion in general, both in principle and practice. And there is, if I mi&s;take not, a particular po&s;itive rea&s;on for under&s;tanding it in &s;uch a latitude in the text. In this comprehen|&s;ive &s;en&s;e, it will accordingly be con&s;idered in the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>FOR the farther illu&s;tration hereof, it may be ob&s;erved that this expre&s;&s;ion, "&s;ober-minded," naturally &s;ugge&s;ts to us, that true &s;obriety, or all true wi&s;dom, begins, and has its &s;eat in the
<PB N="37" REF="009440_0052_0F7490E785C11948">
mind, &s;oul or &s;pirit; the intellectual, immortal, and mo&s;t excellent part of our compound nature: That it con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;oul's, or mind's being rightly informed, di&s;po&s;ed, and under due regula|tion. If the mind be not duly enlightened, rightly affected, and under a proper influence, no per&s;on, whether old or young, can be truly wi&s;e, virtuous or &s;ober. Not the body, but the mind it&s;elf, is mo&s;t properly the re&s;idence, or &s;eat, of true wi&s;dom and &s;obriety; of all morally good qualities. However inoffen&s;ive, blamele&s;s or regular a per&s;on's external behaviour in life may be; yet if you &s;uppo&s;e him at the &s;ame time to have a mind de&s;titute of knowledge, uninfor|med with truth, void of &s;incerity and good prin|ciple; or, in one word, if you &s;uppo&s;e him de&s;|titute of a "&s;ober mind," in the &s;trict, literal &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words, you certainly &s;uppo&s;e him to be neither wi&s;e nor good, in a moral &s;en&s;e, You &s;uppo&s;e, indeed, &s;ome appearance of wi&s;dom, of &s;obriety, or of virtue; but it is only the ap|pearance, not the reality; the &s;hadow without the &s;ub&s;tance. Or, if I may be indulged the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, you &s;uppo&s;e a fair, magnificent temple, but no Deity, no God within. Nay, farther; If you &s;uppo&s;e the &s;oul, or mind of man, un|adorned with knowledge, virtue, and good prin|ciple; do you not, of con&s;equence, &s;uppo&s;e it to be deformed and deba&s;ed by error, ignorance, vice, or po&s;itively bad principles? Doubtle&s;s you do. The mind of an infant has, indeed, been con&s;idered by &s;ome, as a <HI>charte blanche,</HI> or clean paper, fit to receive any in&s;cription, impre&s;&s;ion or
<PB N="38" REF="009440_0053_0F7490E833F6D758">
character; and tho' not endowed with any knowledge or virtue, &s;till not po&s;itively erroneous, vitiated, or morally corrupted: With the truth and ju&s;tne&s;s of which &s;uppo&s;ition, I am not now concerned. But you cannot even &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on that is come to years, &s;o as to be a moral agent, in &s;uch a middle &s;tate as this, betwixt knowledge and error, good and evil di&s;po&s;itions. If &s;uch a per&s;on, tho' but a young man, is de&s;titute of wi&s;dom, virtue, and a right turn of mind, he is certainly and po&s;itively erroneous, fooli&s;h, vici|ous, or wrongly di&s;po&s;ed. Whatever may be imagined re&s;pecting the &s;oul of an infant; yet the &s;oul of &s;uch a moral agent, cannot be con|ceived de&s;titute of all thought and &s;entiment, of all opinion and principles; and if it is not under the influence of &s;uch as are true and right, vir|tuous and good; it mu&s;t of cour&s;e be defiled, corrupted and depraved by &s;uch as are erroneous and vicious; as was &s;aid before. So that tho' I ju&s;t now compared a per&s;on, who is apparently &s;ober or virtuous, but without &s;incerity, without good principle, to a beautiful temple in which no Deity re&s;ides; it now &s;eems that &s;uch a one may, with far more propriety, be likened to a <Q>whited &s;epulchre, which indeed appears beautiful out|ward, but is within full of dead mens bones, and of all uncleanne&s;s</Q>.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. 23. 37.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now, if the very "mind and con&s;cience are thus defiled", thus under the influence of error, of wrong di&s;po&s;itions and affections; &s;urely you cannot think &s;uch a per&s;on "&s;ober-mined",
<PB N="39" REF="009440_0054_0F7490E905FAD2A0">
whatever his external appearance may be. Let me ju&s;t add here, that tho', in many characters, there is &s;uch a &s;trange mixture of wi&s;dom and folly, virtue and vice, &s;incerity and hypocri&s;y, that it is next to impo&s;&s;ible for any mortal to determine, whether the good or the bad quali|ties predominate, &s;o as to con&s;titute the general character; yet doubtle&s;s, either the former or the latter actually do &s;o in every man. For other|wi&s;e, there would be a moral agent without any moral character!&mdash;unle&s;s this can be ju&s;tly ac|counted one&mdash;That he is neither wi&s;e nor fooli&s;h, virtuous nor vicious, good nor bad, but &s;omething, no one can tell what, between both: Which, to be &s;ure, will not be ea&s;ily admitted even as a &s;uppo&s;eable ca&s;e or fact, by tho&s;e that have given their attention to the important &s;ubject of morals and religion.</P>
<P>BUT tho' it is &s;ugge&s;ted by the very expre&s;&s;i|on in the text, that the mind it&s;elf is the &s;eat of virtue, wi&s;dom or &s;obriety, as was &s;aid before; yet you are not to imagine that when you are exhorted to be &s;ober-minded, this exhortation re&s;pects your minds, or inner man only; or, that it has no reference to your outward behaviour. There is an external &s;obriety of the manners, as well as an internal one of the mind; tho' the latter is, indeed, the fir&s;t to be con&s;idered and re|garded. But the mind being &s;et right, or duly informed and di&s;po&s;ed; your outward actions and conver&s;ation are al&s;o to be under a proper regu|lation; &s;uch as corre&s;ponds to a &s;ober mind. Yea, farther, if your minds are endowed with
<PB N="40" REF="009440_0055_0F7490E9B26F4140">
true wi&s;dom or &s;obriety, your outward conduct will, without doubt, be &s;ober and regular al&s;o. The&s;e things cannot well be &s;eparated even in i|magination. The former of them infers the lat|ter; though the latter of them does not, at lea&s;t not &s;o nece&s;&s;arily, infer the former. For we may much more ea&s;ily conceive of a per&s;on's having the external appearance of virtue and &s;obriety in his behaviour, without the reality of it in his mind, than we can, on the other hand, conceive of his being really wi&s;e, or &s;ober-minded, and yet com|monly acting fooli&s;hly and viciou&s;ly. The for|mer is not an impo&s;&s;ibility; but the latter is &s;o, even in nature. There being, therefore, &s;uch a clo&s;e and manife&s;t connection betwixt &s;obriety of mind, and of conver&s;ation, both which are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a truly good character; the exhortation which we are con&s;idering, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;pect and comprehend both; the former of them, indeed, primarily, and mo&s;t di|rectly, and the latter of them indirectly, or con|&s;equentially; but yet no le&s;s truly and certainly than it does the other, the &s;obriety of the mind.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould be further ob&s;erved, that there are not, properly &s;peaking, two or more different kinds of true &s;obriety, wi&s;dom or religion; one for the old, another for the middle-aged, and a third for the young; or one for male, and ano|ther for female: But there is one kind of reli|gion, wi&s;dom or &s;obriety for all; even as there is but one God, one Lord, one faith, one hope of our calling; one general rule, or manner of conver&s;ation, pre&s;cribed for all. There are, in|deed,
<PB N="41" REF="009440_0056_0F7490EA746836C8">
&s;ome peculiar obligations and duties re|&s;ulting from our re&s;pective relations and circum|&s;tances in life. There are certain things incum|bent upon the aged, which are not &s;o, upon the young; at lea&s;t not in the &s;ame degree: As, on the other hand, there are &s;ome, to which youth are more e&s;pecially obliged; and &s;ome follies, in|di&s;cretions and vices, which they need more par|ticularly to be warned again&s;t. But the&s;e are no more than circum&s;tantial differences. True &s;o|briety, wi&s;dom or religion, is &s;till e&s;&s;entially one and the &s;ame thing, not only in old and young, but in male and female, bond and free; the par|ticular duties which are proper and peculiar to the&s;e &s;tates or conditions re&s;pectively, making no e&s;&s;ential difference. As a man in health may in rea&s;on be bound to do &s;ome things which a &s;ick one is not, and <HI>vice ver&s;a;</HI> or as a man in civil office and authority may be bound to do &s;ome things which a man in a private capacity is not obliged to do, yea, cannot do lawfully or in|nocently; and yet a truly wi&s;e and &s;ober man is of the &s;ame religion both in health and &s;ickne&s;s, and whether he &s;u&s;tains a public, or only a private character: So the old and the young, male and female, the great and &s;mall, all per&s;ons in gene|ral, are under obligation to be of the &s;ame reli|gion, e&s;&s;entially con&s;idered, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome differences in their re&s;pective duties, ari&s;ing out of their particular relations and circum&s;tances in life. And the &s;ame &s;pirit of truth, of virtue and wi&s;dom, actually re&s;ides, operates in, and actuates them all, if they are truly &s;ober-minded.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="009440_0057_0F7490EB4CBA02C8">
Now, that &s;obriety of mind to which young men are to be exhorted, is unque&s;tionably a <HI>reli|gious</HI> &s;obriety; founded in a due regard to al|mighty God; conformable to the dictates of right rea&s;on, and &s;uch as all per&s;ons in general, of whatever age or condition, are under obliga|tion to; and including, moreover, whatever par|ticular duties are, either exclu&s;ively, or more e&s;|pecially, incumbent upon the young. It cannot, &s;urely, be &s;uppo&s;ed that the apo&s;tle, in the text, intended any thing &s;hort of a truly religious, pi|ous, or godly &s;obriety of mind; as was ju&s;t now intimated. And there is the more rea&s;on for particularly ob&s;erving this to you; becau&s;e there is &s;omething that often pa&s;&s;es in the world under the name of &s;obriety, which, tho' really implied and comprehended therein, and therefore good and commendable in its place, does yet by no means come up to the full and proper idea hereof; but is e&s;&s;entially defective, being without any piety at bottom.</P>
<P>THIS matter de&s;erves to be more particularly &s;tated and explained. We &s;ometimes &s;peak of &s;o|briety particularly in oppo&s;ition to intemperance in eating and drinking; and when we mention any one as a &s;ober man, we mean, perhaps, no more than that he is free from the&s;e gro&s;s and &s;hameful vices. Sometimes by a &s;ober man, we mean only one that is not addicted to leud, la&s;civious practices. Sometimes by a &s;ober man, we mean no more than one who is externally grave and &s;olid, in contradi&s;tinction from a light, airy and fanta&s;tic one. Sometimes we u&s;e the
<PB N="43" REF="009440_0058_0F7490EBF1FC14E0">
&s;ame word in a little larger &s;en&s;e; meaning per|haps, by a &s;ober man, one that is of a grave and &s;erious deportment in general; free from all the gro&s;s vices of intemperance, and debauchery, of rioting and la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s; and one that &s;teadily minds his proper worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, being, in that re&s;pect, a good member of &s;ociety. Now, altho' the&s;e things are all really commendable in their places, and, without doubt, included in that &s;o|briety of mind which is intended in the text; yet they are an extremely imperfect and defici|ent notion of it. This appears, indeed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from what has been already &s;aid, re&s;|pecting the nece&s;&s;ity of internal &s;obriety; which is not nece&s;&s;arily implied in &s;uch an externally grave and &s;ober conver&s;ation. But what I &s;till more particularly intend here, is, that this idea of &s;obriety is very defective and imperfect, ina&s;|much as it does not nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e a due re|gard to God, or any truly <HI>religious</HI> principle, as the &s;pring and &s;ource of it.</P>
<P>AN Athei&s;t, or the fool who faith in his heart, There is no God, may po&s;&s;ibly be a &s;ober man in this low and partial &s;en&s;e. There is &s;uch a thing as con&s;titutional gravity, or a natural &s;edate|ne&s;s and &s;olidity, and &s;ort of aver&s;ion to tho&s;e gro&s;s vices in &s;ome men: Or a mere &s;en&s;e of de|cency may pre&s;erve &s;ome therefrom, while they are de&s;titute both of the love and fear of God, or of all religious principle. A per&s;on may ab|&s;tain from them, and in that partial &s;en&s;e be a &s;ober man, from worldly prudence and policy only; motives, which tho' not po&s;itively evil,
<PB N="44" REF="009440_0059_0F7490EE0C7F14D8">
yet cannot be accounted good in a religious, or even moral &s;en&s;e: For, to be good in this &s;en&s;e, &s;uppo&s;es a regard to God, and to moral obliga|tions.</P>
<P>LET me add, tho' it may &s;eem &s;trange, per|haps, at the fir&s;t thought, that it is po&s;&s;ible this external &s;obriety of behaviour may, in &s;ome ca&s;es, be owing to a po&s;itively wrong and vicious principle: So that if a per&s;on were of a le&s;s de|generate and depraved mind than he is in &s;ome re&s;pects, he would of cour&s;e al&s;o have le&s;s of this outward gravity and &s;obriety. This ob&s;er|vation might be illu&s;trated and confirmed by divers examples; but one may &s;uffice. A man, then, may be worldly-minded and cove|tous to a prodigious degree; having all his thoughts and de&s;ires centred on earthly riches, and his mind continually employed on the methods of obtaining and keeping them; while he <Q>&s;ays to the gold, Thou art my hope; and to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence.</Q> Now this is unque&s;tionably an irrational, vicious principle; a po&s;itively wrong and depraved turn of mind. And yet it is, in its natural con&s;equences and operations, a check, and powerful re&s;traint to the vices of leudne&s;s and luxury, of riot and debauch|ery. Such a predominant, boundle&s;s love of riches, naturally and directly leads to a diligent application to worldly bu&s;ine&s;s; to an external gravity of deportment; and to &s;obriety of con|ver&s;ation, in that partial &s;en&s;e of it, &s;poken of above; or as it &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to the wa&s;t|ing, impoveri&s;hing vices of idlene&s;s, luxury, and
<PB N="45" REF="009440_0060_0F7490EE86792A60">
an exce&s;&s;ive indulgence of the &s;en&s;ual appetites. The&s;e vices are, in their very nature, incompatible with extreme avarice. Nor did the world ever yet &s;ee a thorough MISER, that was addicted to them; &s;eldom one, who did not loudly declaim again&s;t them as odious, &s;candalous and <HI>ruinous</HI> ones. Were &s;uch a grave, rich&mdash;poor&mdash;happy&mdash;mi&s;erable man, freer from this particular pre|dominant vice, he might very probably have le&s;s external &s;obriety; and, in&s;tead of al|ways preaching again&s;t the follies, extravagances, and criminal exce&s;&s;es of young men, &s;ometimes conde&s;cend to make one of a party with them in the&s;e exce&s;&s;es&mdash;Mere pride, that hateful &s;in, may, in &s;ome ca&s;es, be &s;uppo&s;ed to produce the like external gravity and &s;obriety, by ab&s;orbing, as it were, all the feebler lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions. In &s;hort, it comes to this at la&s;t, that one enormous, gigantic and voracious vice,</P>
<P>"Like Aaron's &s;erpent, &s;wallows up the re&s;t".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">POPF.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS, you &s;ee, it is po&s;&s;ible, not only for real, but great and enormous vices of the mind, to contribute to the appearance of virtue and &s;obriety in the external conver&s;ation; particu|larly in the in&s;tances which have now been men|tioned. But that &s;obriety to which all, and young men in particular, are to be exhorted, as was &s;aid before, is primarily in internal &s;obriety of the mind; and not meerly &s;o, but a truly religious &s;obriety, re&s;ulting from a proper regard to God, his authority and commandments. Whatever &s;obriety, whether of mind or manners,
<PB N="46" REF="009440_0061_0F7490EF51DCC4E8">
or both, may be conceived of without piety, without religious principle; this is not that which is intended in the text. It is e&s;&s;entially defective; it does not de&s;erve the name of &s;o|briety in a religious &s;en&s;e, tho' it may be &s;o called in a civil or political one; and tho' it may contribute to a man's reputation and intere&s;t in the world; yea, may render him a very u&s;eful and re&s;pectable member of &s;ociety. Nor &s;hould we, indeed, ever indulge to groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picions about the &s;incerity of particular per&s;ons; which were highly injurious and criminal.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be ob&s;erved farther, that the &s;obrie|ty to which you are exhorted, is not only in ge|neral a religious, but a truly <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> &s;obriety of mind and manners: Such as corre&s;ponds to the faith of the go&s;pel, and to the commandments of God as promulgated by his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and therefore pre&s;uppo&s;es belief in him as the light, the &s;aviour and judge of the world. We may be very certain that the great apo&s;tle Paul, (who him&s;elf de&s;ired neither to preach nor to know any thing, in compari&s;on of "Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him crucified") giving directions to Titus as a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, and enjoining him among&s;t other things, to exhort young men to &s;obriety, had in his mind nothing &s;hort of that &s;obriety which is in its nature truly chri&s;tian; agreeable to the glorious di&s;coveries, and the genius of the go&s;pel; &s;uch an one as is regulat|ed by its precepts, and made manife&s;t in a conver&s;ation becoming this divine in&s;titution. It were quite unnatural to &s;uppo&s;e that the apo&s;tle
<PB N="47" REF="009440_0062_0F7490EFB55DC228">
had in view, only &s;uch a &s;obriety as a meer pagan who believes the being of a God, may po&s;&s;ibly be the &s;ubject of: Nay, it would be &s;o, to &s;up|po&s;e he intended only &s;uch a &s;obriety as a Jew, &s;till under the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation, might po&s;&s;e&s;s, or practi&s;e. It cannot be rea&s;onably imagined, that he would have had Titus exhort the young men of Crete, who were partly Gentiles, and partly Jews by birth, to be &s;ober-minded upon the principles of the gentile theology, which were &s;o vain and ab&s;urd; and which he him&s;elf every where decried: Nor yet only upon the true principles of natural religion; which di&s;covers not any way wherein &s;inful creatures may certainly obtain eternal life: Nor yet, la&s;tly, upon the footing of the Mo&s;aic law, which was "weak thro' the fle&s;h"; and of which the &s;ame apo&s;tle him&s;elf &s;ays, that as many as are of the works of it, "are under a cur&s;e." If we con&s;ider the character of the writer, and of the per&s;on to whom he wrote, together with the time, occa&s;ion and circum&s;tances hereof, we cannot doubt but that St. Paul's meaning was, that Titus &s;hould exhort the Cretian young men to receive the revelation of the grace of God by his Son from heaven, upon its proper evi|dences; and to live in a practical conformity to the holy precepts of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>THAT he intended nothing below, or &s;hort of, &s;uch a truly chri&s;tian &s;obriety of mind, is farther evident from hence. The &s;everal exhor|tations which Titus is enjoined to give to the old and young, &amp;c. re&s;pectively, are introduced thus,
<PB N="48" REF="009440_0063_0F7490F076DD3E08">
with particular reference to &s;ome per&s;ons, "who&s;e mouths were to be &s;toped,&mdash;e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the circumci&s;ion";&mdash;<Q>But &s;peak thou, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, the things which be|come SOUND DOCTRINE: That the aged men,</Q> &amp;c. And one rea&s;on particularly a&s;&s;ign|ed, why Titus &s;hould teach, and exhort to, the&s;e things, and others practi&s;e them, is, "that the WORD OF GOD be not bla&s;phemed." Now, certainly, what the apo&s;tle intended by the word of God, and &s;ound doctrine, is neither more nor le&s;s than the go&s;pel of God. This, if proof were needed, would be manife&s;t from a paral|lel pa&s;&s;age in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy&mdash;<Q>And if there be any other thing that is con|trary to SOUND DOCTRINE, <HI>according to the glorious go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God, which was committed to my tru&s;t</HI></Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 1, 10, 11.</NOTE>. This go&s;pel of the kingdom then, is the &s;ound doctrine intended, and that word of God, which &s;hould not be bla&s;|phemed. Who then can doubt, but that the &s;obriety of mind &s;poken of by the apo&s;tle, is the &s;ame thing in effect, with the belief and practice of the chri&s;tian religion? Or, if any like this expre&s;&s;ion better,&mdash;a practical faith in the go&s;pel; tho', for my own part, I know of no real difference in the &s;en&s;e of them.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame thing is farther manife&s;t, beyond all doubt, from the words of the apo&s;tle a few ver&s;es after the text: Where he &s;ugge&s;ts &s;ome other mo|tives to, or rea&s;ons for, the ob&s;ervation of the &s;eve|ral exhortations before-mentioned:&mdash;<Q>That they
<PB N="49" REF="009440_0064_0F7490F14D4F8050">
may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. For the grace of God&mdash;hath ap|peared&mdash;teaching us, that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly&mdash;looking for that ble&s;&s;ed hope, and&mdash;our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us,</Q> &amp;c. The text being con&s;idered thus in connexion with what preceeds and follows it; the &s;obriety intended therein, is evidently &s;uch a &s;obriety of mind, not as Socrates or Plato, not as Cicero or Seneca taught, tho' in &s;ome re&s;pects truly excellent; nor yet merely &s;uch as Mo&s;es and the prophets taught; much le&s;s &s;till, &s;uch as Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> and Lord <HI>Bollingbroke</HI> taught: But &s;uch as the LORD FROM HEAVEN, and his in&s;pired apo&s;tles taught; and &s;uch as all are to practi&s;e, who hope to a&s;cend thither where he is, to behold, and to partake of his glory. And who&s;oever pretends to exhort any, whether old or young, to be &s;ober-minded, without keep|ing in view, and proceeding upon, this truly di|vine plan&mdash;the doctrine of our redemption from &s;in and death by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of life and im|mortality bro't to light thro' the go&s;pel, at be&s;t does his work to the halves; and, by no means, frames his exhortation according to the manife&s;t de&s;ign, and true &s;pirit of the text.</P>
<P>THUS, my young brethren, I have given you &s;ome general and imperfect idea of the &s;obriety to which you are exhorted: Nothing beyond this was intended by the foregoing remarks re|lative hereto. Let me now de&s;cend to a more di&s;tinct explanation of it, in conformity to this
<PB N="50" REF="009440_0065_0F7490F2A77FE0A0">
general idea, and to the&s;e cur&s;ory ob&s;ervations, which I &s;hall &s;till keep in view; and if you &s;hould do the &s;ame, it might not be unu&s;eful to you. In the fir&s;t place, then,</P>
<P>I. THIS &s;obriety of mind is founded in a firm belief of God's being and perfections, his moral government and univer&s;al providence, agreeably to the light of nature, or natural rea&s;on, and to the expre&s;s doctrine of holy &s;cripture; for the&s;e do not contradict, but mutually confirm and il|lu&s;trate each other. One of the &s;acred writers u&s;es a very bold, and equally noble figure, in &s;peaking of the clear evidence which God, who is invi&s;ible, hath given of his exi&s;tence and per|fections, to mankind in general, by the vi&s;ible ef|fects of his power. <Q>That which may be known of God,</Q> &s;aith he, "is manife&s;t in [or to] them" [the gentile nations;] <Q>for God hath &s;hewn it unto them. For the INVISIBLE THINGS OF HIM from the creation of the world are CLEARLY SEEN, being under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 1. 19. 20.</NOTE> Altho' the world by wi&s;dom knew not God; i. e. tho' mankind in general did not actually attain to any tolerable know|ledge of the true God by natural rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy; yet it is certain, even upon princi|ples of rea&s;on, both that there is One, and but One God; an all-perfect being: One, and but One, who is underived, unbegotton, proceeding from none, and ab&s;olutely independent: "Of whom, and thro' whom, and to whom [of con|&s;equence] are all things;"&mdash;all other per&s;ons and
<PB N="51" REF="009440_0066_0F7490F2B28D4CA8">
beings, whether vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible. So that no one, of whom it can be truly and properly &s;aid, that he is either made or created, begotten or produced, derived from, or dependent upon a|nother, is him&s;elf the unmade and uncreated, the unbegotton and unproduced, the underived and independent Creator, or only living and true God: For this were a contradiction in terms.</P>
<P>THE divine attributes, as di&s;covered to us by the wonderful works and word of God in conjunction, are, eternity, independence, or nece&s;&s;ary &s;elf-exi&s;tence; immen&s;ity, or omni|pre&s;ence; incorporeity, or &s;pirituality; boundle&s;s power, perfect knowledge, and unerring wi&s;dom; perfect purity, holine&s;s and ju&s;tice, truth and faithfulne&s;s, goodne&s;s, mercy, and immutability. For in all the&s;e re&s;pects, in all truly divine per|fections, God is nece&s;&s;arily, and therefore immu|tably the &s;ame, even from everla&s;ting to ever|la&s;ting, <Q>without variablene&s;s, or &s;hadow of turning.</Q> And as God originally created all things; &s;o he continually pre&s;erves, pre&s;ides over, and governs them by his providence, in the mo&s;t wi&s;e, righteous, good and gracious manner: Being a lover of all virtue and goodne&s;s, and abhorring all vice and wickedne&s;s, even while he is merciful to the wicked; good and kind even to the unthankful and to the evil. It will not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve further here, that the holy &s;crip|tures &s;peak much oftener, and far more largely and particularly, of God's goodne&s;s and mercy, than of any of his other perfections; a&s;&s;uring us, that "the Lord is good to ALL, and his ten|der
<PB N="52" REF="009440_0067_0F7490F3718B3E28">
mercies over ALL his works;" that "there is none good but One, that is God;" that "God is love"&mdash;goodne&s;s and love it&s;elf, perfect and univer&s;al, eternal and immutable love: And it is repeated no le&s;s than twenty-&s;ix times in one p&s;alm, that "his mercy endureth for ever."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 136.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now, faith in God, his perfections and provi|dence, and particularly in his goodne&s;s and mercy, is not only an e&s;&s;ential ingredient in, but the very foundation of, all true &s;obriety, or religion. For, in the language of in&s;piration, which is in this re&s;pect at lea&s;t, the language of rea&s;on al&s;o, <Q>with|out faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God; for he that cometh to God, mu&s;t believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligent|ly &s;eek him.</Q><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. XI. 6.</NOTE> Though I cannot but ob&s;erve by the way, that &s;ome modern pretended re|formers of the &s;uppo&s;ed errors and here&s;ies a|mong us, &s;eem rather to have aimed at e&s;tabli&s;h|ing it as a fundamental article of faith, that God is NOT "a rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him;" but that men may &s;eek him, not only earne&s;tly and diligently, but do &s;o all their lives, and yet not find his favor extended to them, or finally receive any reward of him&mdash;except the reward of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in eternal torments! But if this be accounted orthodoxy, I mu&s;t, for my own part, humbly confe&s;s with the apo&s;tle Paul, <Q>that after the way which they call here&s;y, &s;o wor&s;hip I the God of my fathers; believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets, [and the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t al&s;o:] and have HOPE TOWARDS GOD:</Q><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Acts XXIV. 14. 15.</NOTE> Which
<PB N="53" REF="009440_0068_0F7490F5549EEE40">
even the be&s;t men upon earth can hardly have, upon the principles of &s;uch a &s;purious orthodoxy as that ju&s;t now referred to.</P>
<P>BUT to return. If, in&s;tead of believing the exi&s;tence and perfections, the moral government and univer&s;al providence of the equally great and good God, you have him not in all your thoughts; if you do not duly regard him; but bani&s;h him, as it were, out of his own world, the univer&s;e which &s;prung from nothing at his word: If you do thus, it is impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould have any true &s;obriety of mind, any real wi&s;dom. For the knowledge or fear of the Lord, is even literally "the beginning of wi&s;dom." They that know not God, know nothing as they ought to know it; nor do any thing as they ought to do it.</P>
<P>LET me therefore, my young brethren, take occa&s;ion here to caution you again&s;t li&s;tening with a favourable ear, to any athei&s;tical notions; &s;uch as &s;trike at the being, attributes, or moral government of God; and, thereby, at the very root of all religion and virtue. There are not wanting tho&s;e in this apo&s;tate, this fooli&s;h and wicked world, who &s;cruple not even to tell others, they are fools, by intimating that they "&s;ay in their hearts, <HI>There is no God;</HI>" or at lea&s;t, no &s;uch holy, wi&s;e and righteous one as is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed; none, from whom we have any thing to fear if we do evil, or to hope if we do well. And there are &s;ome young men, tho', I would charitably hope, not among&s;t you;&mdash;yea, &s;ome that are more advanced in years, who either
<PB N="54" REF="009440_0069_0F7490F61ACF4418">
from an unwillingne&s;s to part with their lu&s;ts, or, at be&s;t, from great levity of mind, and an affec|tation of &s;ingularity, li&s;ten with plea&s;ure to &s;uch &s;en&s;ele&s;s notions, when they hear them advanced; and read the books with delight, in which &s;ome per&s;ons even of the la&s;t and pre&s;ent age, have &s;hewn a &s;trange ambition to record their own folly and impiety to the ages that are to come. Take heed, my beloved brethren, le&s;t any of you &s;hould al&s;o be carried away with the&s;e errors of the wicked; of &s;uch fools as the&s;e.</P>
<P>I HARDLY need de&s;ire you, by way of anti|dote again&s;t the poi&s;on, and mortal venom of &s;uch principles, to lift your eyes to the heavens above; to ob&s;erve the &s;tupendous magnitude, the regular motions, the beautiful order, of the nu|merous worlds that roll there; or to a&s;k you, how they came there? and by whom they are pre&s;erved from age to age in this wonderful or|der and harmony? I &s;carce need, for this end, to de&s;ire you even to look down upon the earth, or to look round the world which you inhabit; in which there are actually innumerable, indefi|nite marks and characters of infinite power, of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. It will be &s;ufficient if you con&s;ider tho&s;e micro|co&s;ms, tho&s;e little worlds, your own bodies; which are indeed "fearfully and wonderfully made;"&mdash;with amazing &s;kill, an art truly admira|ble and a&s;toni&s;hing to every attentive ob&s;erver. And who&s;e hand formed and fa&s;hioned the&s;e? Certainly no human one: The art, wi&s;dom and power of all the &s;ons of Adam united, would
<PB N="55" REF="009440_0070_0F7490F696321548">
not &s;uffice for the forming a &s;ingle fly, emmit or mite. Nay, all human wi&s;dom cannot even com|prehend the workman&s;hip and art of the lea&s;t in|&s;ect; tho' it may &s;ee enough thereof, to be at once convinced and confounded. What then will you &s;ay of your own bodies? Who&s;e workman|&s;hip are they?</P>
<P>BUT if even your bodies mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the product of a wi&s;dom, a &s;kill, an art and power, &s;o much &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all that is human; what will you &s;ay of your minds, your &s;ouls, which direct and governs them? From whence come knowledge, reflexion, memory? from whence, will, choice and liberty? from whence the power of at once looking back on what is pa&s;t, and forward on what is future? Are the&s;e intellectual powers and faculties of yours, eternal and nece&s;&s;ary? No. It is but a few days &s;ince you your&s;elves came into exi&s;tence. Were they then without any cau&s;e? No. Nothing can be &s;o, that is not both eternal and nece&s;&s;ary. Were they then the product of inert, unknowing, &s;en&s;ele&s;s matter? That cannot be: Knowledge, choice and power cannot, &s;urely, be derived from that which is it&s;elf de&s;titute of all knowledge, choice and power. From whence and from whom then, came the&s;e intellectual powers? To &s;uppo&s;e that you need to be told, would hardly be con&s;i&s;tent with the very &s;uppo&s;ition, that you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them. From hence appears at once, the being and the &s;pirituality of God; and the extreme &s;tupidity of all image-wor&s;hip. For there never was a more rational, a more con|clu&s;ive
<PB N="56" REF="009440_0071_0F7490F73A6E2CF8">
argument than this which follows&mdash;<Q>For-a&s;much then as WE are the OFFSPRING OF GOD, we ought not to think that the GODHEAD is like unto gold, or &s;ilver, or &s;tone graven by art, and man's device.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts XVII. 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>MOREOVER: Do not your moral faculties, particularly your &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice, demon&s;trate the moral cha|racter of Him, who&s;e offspring you are? Un|doubtedly, in the cleare&s;t manner; and, con&s;e|quently that, under his government, virtue &s;hall be rewarded and vice puni&s;hed. Each man's own con&s;cience, is in a &s;ort a divine me&s;&s;enger, a prophet to him&s;elf; foretelling, as one may ex|pre&s;s it, <Q>a day wherein God will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q> O then, let not this prophet within you, preach righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;obriety, or prophecy to you, in vain. If you hearken to the dictates of this prophet, one may very &s;afely conclude, that you will not reject the te&s;timony of tho&s;e who appeared in the world in ancient times; and particularly, not <Q>JESUS of Nazareth, who was a phophet mighty in deed and word, before GOD, and all the people.</Q> [Luke XXIV. 19.]&mdash;But this naturally brings me to ob&s;erve more di&s;tinctly, tho' in conformity to what was intimated before,</P>
<P>II. THAT the &s;obriety of mind to which you are exhorted, implies a belief of the go&s;pel, or of the chri&s;tian revelation: For it is not merely a religious, but a chri&s;tian &s;obriety, that is in|tended in the text.

<P>BUT, to prevent your drawing any wrong in|ferences, on the other hand, from the&s;e expre&s;|&s;ions; let me remind you of two or three pa&s;&s;a|ges of &s;cripture, which may help to explain them.

III. 9.</NOTE> In that to the Hebrews, the following: "GOD&mdash;hath in the&s;e la&s;t days &s;po|ken to us by his Son&mdash;by whom al&s;o HE made the worlds."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ch. I. 1, 2.</NOTE> The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages may help to ex|plain tho&s;e, in which the worlds, even all things, are &s;poken of as having been made, or created by, or thro' Chri&s;t the Son of God, without any particular mention of the FATHER. Moreover; to prevent any wrong inferences from its being &s;aid by St. John, "<HI>In the beginning</HI> was the Word;" you need only to be reminded of the very fir&s;t words in your bible: <Q><HI>In the beginning</HI> God created the heaven and the earth.</Q> Again: To prevent any wrong inferences from Je&s;us Chri&s;t's being &s;tiled God, as he is &s;everal times in &s;cripture; it will be &s;ufficient only to remind you of his own words on one or two occa&s;ions. When the captious Jews charged him with bla&s;phemy, becau&s;e, as they &s;aid, he, "being a man, made him&s;elf God;" his an&s;wer was, <Q>Is it not written in your law, I &s;aid, <HI>ye are gods?</HI> If He <HI>called them gods,</HI> on whom

The next &s;hall al&s;o be the words of our Lord him&s;elf, in his prayer to the Father, a little before his death: <Q>And this is life eternal, that they might know THEE the only true GOD, and him whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent, Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John XVII. 3.</NOTE> [This is the literal tran&s;lation] Ano|ther pa&s;&s;age directly to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, &s;hall be from the apo&s;tle Paul, who is, by &s;ome, &s;up|po&s;ed him&s;elf once or twice to have &s;tiled Je&s;us Chri&s;t, GOD: If &s;o, it is but candid to let him be his own interpreter&mdash;<Q>There is none other GOD but ONE.

<P>WITH re&s;pect to the per&s;on of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, it mu&s;t be farther ob&s;erved, "That in the fulne&s;s of time God &s;ent forth his &s;on, made of a woman;"&mdash;that the "Word was made fle&s;h;" that <Q>fora&s;much as the children were partakers of fle&s;h and blood, he al&s;o him&s;elf took part of the &s;ame;&mdash;that he was found in fa&s;hion as a man;&mdash;and is often &s;tiled the &s;on of man, and a man;&mdash;Je&s;us, a man ap|proved of God;&mdash;the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us;&mdash;that man whom God hath ordained,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould, moreover, be very particularly ob&s;erv|ed, that GOD, even the FATHER, did, in a very particular and eminent, a tran&s;cendently glorious and inexpre&s;&s;ible manner, dwell in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, manife&s;ting his glory in, by and thro' him. On which account it doubtle&s;s is, that he is &s;ometimes called God; and that they who had &s;een him, are &s;aid to have "&s;een the FATHER;" who yet, &s;trictly &s;peaking, is "the invi&s;ible GOD;" and who&s;e "image," even "the bright|ne&s;s of his glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on," hypo&s;ta&s;is, &s;ub&s;tance, or e&s;&s;ence, Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;aid to be. As to the particular mode of the divine inhabitation in Chri&s;t, it is neither revealed, nor to be comprehended by mortal men; who cannot even comprehend the manner in which their own &s;pirits dwell in their bodies. But I repeat it, le&s;t I &s;hould be mi&s;under|&s;tood, that it was "God, even the Father," ac|cording

<P N="3">3. ONE principal end of Chri&s;t's manife&s;tation in the fle&s;h, was, to make known the Father; the nature and truth of God, or the principles of true religion, in a more clear, full and perfect manner, than they had been made known be|fore, by Mo&s;es or any of the ancient prophets, or even John, that burning and &s;hining light; the greate&s;t of all the prophets, till the Son of God him&s;elf appeared in that character from heaven.</P>
<P>AT the time of our Lord's coming into the world, the Jewi&s;h revelation was very gro&s;ly corrupted; the prie&s;ts having long "taught for doctrines the commandments of men;" &s;o that tho' they were not wholly ignorant of the true God, yet "in vain did they wor&s;hip him." Among the gentile nations, there were hardly any traces of true religion to be found. Divine knowledge, the only true wi&s;dom, was far from obtaining among the nations of the world, in proportion as the polite arts and &s;ciences had done. In many countries, particularly Per&s;ia, Chaldea, Egypt, Greece and Italy, the&s;e arts and
<PB N="63" REF="009440_0078_0F7490FDA3867B80">
&s;ciences had been carried to a &s;urpri&s;ing degree of perfection. The poet's numbers were har|monious, and his &s;ong &s;ublime. The mu&s;ician almo&s;t enchanted wild bea&s;ts, and the woods which they haunted, as well as &s;avage men. The orator thunder'd and lighten'd; and, at plea&s;ure, either rais'd or allay'd a &s;torm in the brea&s;ts of his auditors. The noble&s;t piles and &s;tructures aro&s;e under the hands of the architect. The canva&s;s was taught to glow with life, bor|rowed from the painter's pencil; and bra&s;s and marble to breath under the chi&s;&s;el of the &s;tatuary: While the a&s;tronomer &s;urveyed and mea&s;ured the heavens; even tho&s;e heavens which declare the glory of God. But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e improvements, the&s;e wonderful efforts of human genius and indu&s;try, "the world by wi&s;dom knew not God!" With re&s;pect to the knowledge of Him, and of true religion, there was in fact no material difference betwixt the mo&s;t refined, and the mo&s;t &s;avage and barbarous nations under heaven. Witne&s;s the multitude of the gods and godde&s;&s;es acknowledged in them; &s;o great, that it were ea&s;ier to call all the &s;tars by their names, than to number &s;uch a promi&s;cu|ous rabble&mdash;heroes, &s;trumpets, di&s;ea&s;es, plagues, mon&s;ters, vices, con&s;tellations, bea&s;ts, birds, and creeping things!

4. JESUS CHRIST came into the world, not merely as a light to lighten it with the know|ledge of the "only true God"; but to declare his will and commandments authoritatively in his name. <Q>I am come, &s;aith he, in my Father's name</Q>, &amp;c. He came into it as a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s; to inculcate obe|dience to God's laws which were already known; to re&s;cue others from the corrupt interpretations, which by time, the ignorance of the people, and more e&s;pecially the wickedne&s;s of the prie&s;ts, had been put upon them; whereby <Q>the command|ment of God was made of none effect</Q> He came to put an end to the peculiarities of the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation; to <Q>gather in one the children of God that were &s;cattered abroad</Q>; to form them into one &s;piritual body, or church, under him&s;elf as head; that there might be "one fold, and one &s;hepherd".

<P N="5">5. HE came to give mankind the mo&s;t perfect and engaging example of obedience to the will of God; of all piety and righteou&s;ne&s;s, humility and charity, temperance and patience;&mdash;a living example in frail human fle&s;h. For tho' he were made in the "likene&s;s of &s;inful fle&s;h;" yet in him was no &s;in: He was holy, harmle&s;s, un|defiled, &s;eparate from &s;inners.

Indeed, he admoni&s;hed his di&s;ciples in a more general way, to keep his commandments, "that they might abide in his love, even," &s;aith he, "as I have kept my Father's command|ments, and abide in his love." And the apo&s;tle Peter &s;ays of him, that he "left us an example, that we &s;hould follow his &s;teps."</P>
<P N="6">6. HE came to make an atonement for the &s;ins of the world; "to put away &s;ins by the &s;a|crifice of him&s;elf." This he did upon the cro&s;s, when he offered him&s;elf up to God, as a lamb without blemi&s;h and without &s;pot. He is &s;aid to have redeemed men to God by his blood; to have died for us, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, that he might bring us unto God. And it &s;hould be particularly ob&s;erved here, that he died thus, not only for a few particular per&s;ons, as &s;ome &s;eem to imagine, but "died for all,"&mdash;"ta&s;ted death for every man;" and "gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time." Agreeably whereto, the apo&s;tle John &s;peaks of him under the following character&mdash;<Q>Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous, who is the propitiation for our &s;ins, and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the WHOLE WORLD</Q>.

However enthu&s;ia&s;ts have declaimed again&s;t rea&s;on, and rational preachers, while them&s;elves were deplorable examples of the contrary, the religion of Chri&s;t is a mo&s;t rea|&s;onable religion; the wi&s;dom, as well as the power of God to &s;alvation, to every one that &s;incerely believes it. Both its doctrines and precepts, as delivered by him and his apo&s;tles, are rational in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, however they have been perverted &s;ince; bearing a truly divine cha|racter, to tho&s;e that have eyes to &s;ee, in&s;tead of being blinded by the God of this world. In Je&s;us Chri&s;t were fulfilled many illu&s;trious pro|phecies. He wrought &s;till more numerous and a&s;toni&s;hing miracles, by the finger of that God who dwelt in him. He was al&s;o rai&s;ed from the dead him&s;elf, after having rai&s;ed others, "by the power of the Father". He was often &s;een and conver&s;ed with by many credible witne&s;&s;es, who had well known him before. He was vi|&s;ibly taken up into heaven: And, &s;oon after, in conformity to his own promi&s;e, many mira|culous powers were be&s;towed upon his apo&s;tles, and other di&s;ciples; particularly the gift of tongues; by means of which the go&s;pel, under the apparent management of a few fi&s;hermen, and other poor Galileans, made a &s;urprizing pro|gre&s;s in oppo&s;ition to the united wit, malice and power of the world, both Jewi&s;h and Gentile. And divers of Chri&s;t's and his apo&s;tle's predictions
<PB N="71" REF="009440_0086_0F7491035AE6DB28">
have &s;ince been fulfilled, and others of them are daily fulfilling.</P>
<P>THE plain con&s;equence of the&s;e facts, is, That Je&s;us Chri&s;t was, indeed, the Son of God; and that the religion which bears his &s;acred name, is the true religion, which, in all rea&s;on, you are bound to receive with the profounde&s;t reverence and gratitude. Let me therefore ju&s;t remind you further here, of the words of Peter in his own, and the name of the other apo&s;tles, upon a particular occa&s;ion. When many of our Lords di&s;ciples for&s;ook him, in the days of his fle&s;h, and walked no more with him, he turned and &s;aid, in an affectionate manner, "Will ye al&s;o go away?&mdash;at once intimating his unwil|lingne&s;s that they &s;hould do &s;o, and his deter|mination to leave them to their own choice and liberty. Here upon Peter made the following an&s;wer, in which you, my young brethren, mu&s;t be left to join with him or not, as God &s;hall give you light&mdash;<Q>Lord,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John vi. 68, 69</NOTE> to whom &s;hall we go!

<P>HAVING thus &s;hewn that &s;obriety of mind &s;uppo&s;es (1) A belief of God's being and per|fections; and (2) Of the chri&s;tian revelation; let me now ob&s;erve.</P>

III. THAT it al&s;o implies, thinking &s;oberly of your&s;elves. This is an e&s;&s;ential, a mo&s;t im|portant ingredient in chri&s;tian &s;obriety; and it comprehends divers particulars, which &s;hall be mentioned with all convenient brevity. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS implies a &s;en&s;e of your natural ig|norance, or the native darkne&s;s of your under|&s;tandings. You may conclude that I do not here intend any thing that is peculiar to you; but &s;peak with reference to what is common to you with others, All men in general are born into the world, ab&s;olutely ignorant of every thing; they know nothing of what is pa&s;&s;ing in this world or any other. Whatever any know, it is not innate, or born with them; but ac|quired afterwards. And &s;o feeble are their in|tellectual faculties, that however ambitious they are of knowing, or being thought to know a great deal, what they can actually attain to, is comparatively but very little, even tho' they &s;pend much time in the pur&s;uit of knowledge. They are as it were doomed to ignorance by the very condition of their birth, nature and life in this world, notwith&s;tanding either their thir&s;t after, or affection of wi&s;dom. This is the &s;en|timent which is expre&s;&s;ed by Zophar in the book of Job: <Q>Can&s;t thou by &s;earching find out God; can&s;t thou find out the Almighty unto perfec|tion? It is as high as heaven; what can&s;t thou do? deeper than hell; what can&s;t thou know?&mdash;He knoweth vain men&mdash;For vain man would be wi&s;e, though man be born like a wild a&s;s's colt<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. xi. 7&mdash;11.</NOTE></Q>. Young men e&s;pecially, are generally
<PB N="73" REF="009440_0088_0F74910643F93A28">
prone to entertain too high a conceit of their knowledge, and of their capacity for knowing more: Which often makes them over-po&s;itive in their own way, and &s;elf-&s;ufficient. It leads them to de&s;pi&s;e the opinions and coun&s;els of others; of their parents, and other per&s;ons, tho' older and, mo&s;t probably, wi&s;er than them&s;elves. This is of pernicious con&s;equence in many re&s;pects. If, therefore, you would be &s;ober-minded, think &s;oberly of, and know your&s;elves: It becomes you to be mode&s;t, and &s;elf-diffident; not to lean too much to your own under&s;tand|ings; but, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your inexpe|rience, to li&s;ten to advice, and endeavour to learn of others; tho' by no means to re&s;ign up your own under&s;tandings implicitly to the dictate of any; and, lea&s;t of all, in matters of con&s;cience and religion, which are peculiarly your own con|cern. Indeed, you might well &s;u&s;pect the pro|bity of any man's de&s;ign, whatever were his cha|racter, who &s;hould per&s;wade you to put out, or to blind your own eyes in a thick wood; pro|mi&s;ing, that when you had done &s;o, he would be your <HI>faithful guide</HI> out of it;&mdash;e&s;pecially if you had <HI>money</HI> about you. Whoever act &s;uch a part as this by others in their &s;piritual concern|ments, they do not &s;o well de&s;erve the name of mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, as that of thieves, robbers and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ines.</P>
<P N="2">2. THINKING &s;oberly of your&s;elves, implies a due con&s;ideration of your moral frailty and de|pravity; whereby, as in what was la&s;t mentioned, your natural ignorance-nothing is intended that
<PB N="74" REF="009440_0089_0F74910702DBDB78">
is peculiar to your&s;elves, but what is common to the offspring of Adam. There is a great deal of perver&s;ene&s;s and vice, which may be con&s;idered as in &s;ome &s;en&s;e natural to mankind; ari&s;ing from ignorance, or weakne&s;s of under&s;tanding on the one hand, and from &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions on the other. Both the&s;e are certainly natural to mankind. And what is the natural, not to &s;ay, unavoidable con&s;equence of &s;uch a union, or concurrence of ignorance and pa&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame &s;ubject, but ir|regularity of de&s;ire, will and behaviour, in many re&s;pects. But how does the ca&s;e &s;tand in fact? Do not all go a&s;tray, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree, from the paths of rea&s;on and virtue, very early in life? &s;o early, that it occa&s;ioned the P&s;almi&s;t to &s;ay, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> indeed without a figure, that they are <Q>e&s;|tranged from the womb; and go a&s;tray <HI>a&s;&s;oon as they are born, &s;peaking lies</HI></Q>. This, to be &s;ure, is not literally true; nor was it de&s;igned to be &s;o under&s;tood. The meaning is, that the ignorance and pa&s;&s;ions of children are &s;uch, that they &s;peak and act unrea&s;onably, and deviate from the rules of virtue, in a greater or le&s;s degree, al|mo&s;t a&s;&s;oon as they are capable of &s;peaking and acting at all. And the wi&s;er &s;on of David has &s;aid, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, that <Q>childhood and youth are vanity; and that folly is bound up in the heart of a child</Q>. By which he doubtle&s;s means &s;omething that is in a degree vi|cious; not &s;imple, unavoidable ignorance only: For he adds, that the "rod of correction will drive it far from him;" which could not be &s;aid with propriety, of mere natural and unavoidable
<PB N="75" REF="009440_0090_0F749107F67C5570">
ignorance. It is not my de&s;ign to &s;ugge&s;t, that either you, or any others, were really and pro|perly vicious, &s;inful and criminal, before you were capable in any mea&s;ure of di&s;tingui&s;hing be|twixt good and evil: Much le&s;s, that you were ju&s;tly liable to eternal torments, either on account of any corruption of nature which you brought into the world with you, or by rea&s;on of the im|putation of Adam's &s;in to you. For I find no|thing in the &s;criptures that implies either of the&s;e things; and, beyond them I do not chu&s;e to be wi&s;e. But were you not &s;inful creatures, in a degree, a&s;&s;oon as you began to act viciou&s;ly? Was not that very early in life? And is not this at lea&s;t, ju&s;t matter of humiliation to you, and to all? If you are &s;ober-minded; if you think &s;oberly of your&s;elves, even as you ought to think, the mo&s;t harmle&s;s and innocent of you will not be pure in your own eyes; but acknowledge that you are unclean; having been guilty of numberle&s;s irre|gular de&s;ies, and faults; of many vicious actions, from your childhood, &s;ince you were actually capable of di&s;cerning betwixt good and evil. So that if God were &s;trict to mark iniquity, even the mo&s;t innocent of you could not &s;tand in judg|ment. What then would be the con&s;equence, as to the mo&s;t criminal!</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS leads me to ob&s;erve, that think|ing &s;oberly of your&s;elves, implies the &s;erious con|&s;ideration of your &s;tate as you are morally pol|luted creatures, guilty before God, and &s;tanding in need both of purification, and forgivene&s;s with God. That darkne&s;s of the human mind, that
<PB N="76" REF="009440_0091_0F7491088DA291F0">
irregularity of the will, and di&s;order of the af|fections, which may ju&s;tly be termed natural, in the &s;en&s;e before explained, are certainly infelici|ties at lea&s;t, from which all, for their own &s;akes, &s;hould de&s;ire deliverance; that in&s;tead of them, there may be knowledge in the mind, regularity in the will, and a due &s;ubordination of the pa&s;&s;i|ons and affections to right rea&s;on. Herein &s;um|marily con&s;i&s;ts that moral purity which was ju&s;t now hinted at; and which &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to the natural blindne&s;s and depravation of the mind. But you ought to con&s;ider your&s;elves, not merely as carrying about with you a mental di&s;|ea&s;e, which needs a remedy; but al&s;o as culpa|ble and criminal in the &s;ight of God, on account of your actual deviations from the rule of your duty, &s;o far as you have really departed from it, in thought, word or deed; and therefore, as was &s;aid before, &s;tanding in need of forgivene&s;s al&s;o. An holy God, tho' he may pity, and &s;hew mercy to, yet mu&s;t needs be di&s;plea&s;ed with, tho&s;e who knowingly violate his commandments, or the laws of rea&s;on and virtue; as you have all doubtle&s;s done in many in&s;tances. If God had been rigo|rou&s;ly ju&s;t, or de&s;titute of mercy, you might have been ca&s;t off by him even in childhood, for your &s;ins committed in that &s;tate. Your tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|ons have &s;till been growing more numerous, and, probably, more aggravated with your years: So that it is not owing to your own innocence, but to the Lord's mercy, that you are not con&s;umed. And, in order to being &s;ober-minded, you are to think thus &s;oberly of your&s;elves and your
<PB N="77" REF="009440_0092_0F74910931D3D818">
&s;tate, with reference to God and his laws; for this is no more than what you ought to think, it being only truth and fact; and &s;uch truth, the &s;erious con&s;ideration of which, has a very clo&s;e connection with chri&s;tian &s;obriety of mind; or rather, is compri&s;ed in it.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS implies a &s;erious con&s;ideration of your natural frailty, or mortality; of the many evils to which you are liable in this world; of the &s;hortne&s;s and uncertainty of human life, and the certainty of death approaching. Many people, and particularly the young, are apt to entertain fond, romantic conceits about worldly felicity, and to put far away the evil day of death, of adver&s;ity and &s;orrow; &s;eldom, perhaps, thinking of it at all, and when they do, generally flattering them&s;elves that this day is at a great di&s;tance. But if ever you are truly &s;ober-minded, you will think differently upon this &s;ubject. You will &s;ee the vanity of the world and its enjoy|ments; even of all that is in the world, <Q>the lu&s;t of the eye, the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, and the pride of life</Q>. You will often have in your thoughts, the bodily pains and di&s;ea&s;es, the nu|merous cro&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments, and the ma|ny other natural evils, to which mankind are &s;ubjected in the pre&s;ent &s;tate; agreeably to the repre&s;entations of &s;cripture, and to the experience of all ages&mdash;That the creature,-that mankind are "made &s;ubject unto vanity". You will not therefore, if you think &s;oberly of your&s;elves, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate, depend upon any great, unin|terrupted and la&s;ting felicity in this "evil world":
<PB N="78" REF="009440_0093_0F74910A09D4EFF0">
or even upon living long in it. For there are hardly any more obvious truths than the&s;e: That <Q>man that is born of a woman, is of few days and full of trouble: He cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth al&s;o as a &s;hadow, and continueth not.</Q> How frequent are the examples of mortality, even in the young; in the hail and &s;trong, who had the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of any, of long life? How often have you your|&s;elves &s;een the words of Job verified?&mdash;That <Q>one dieth in his full &s;trength, being wholly at ea&s;e and quiet. His brea&s;ts are full of milk, and his bones are moi&s;tened with marrow.</Q> It is not of &s;o great importance for you to know particularly, how mankind originally came into &s;uch a &s;tate as has been mentioned, as it is to know, and duly to con&s;ider, the certainty of it as a fact. It may therefore &s;uffice here, to ob|&s;erve to you in general, that the holy &s;criptures &s;peak of this as having been occa&s;ioned by the &s;in of our fir&s;t parents, or their apo&s;tacy from God&mdash;But ju&s;t &s;entiments concerning human life, mortality and death, con&s;idered as facts, are doubtle&s;s a very material branch of that &s;obriety, to which young men &s;hould be exhorted.</P>
<P N="5">5. A SERIOUS con&s;ideration of the con&s;e|quences of death, belongs al&s;o to this head. The&s;e con&s;equences are mo&s;t important and intere&s;ting in their nature, according to the holy &s;criptures; which repre&s;ent this &s;hort life as a &s;tate of trial or probation, and that which follows it, as a &s;tate of recompence; which is therefore to be either a mo&s;t happy or mi&s;erable one to all men re&s;|pectively,
<PB N="79" REF="009440_0094_0F74910AB56BB478">
according to the deeds done by them "in the body." Tho your bodies are mortal, your &s;ouls will &s;urvive them: "It is appointed unto all men once to die, and after that the judg|ment." Now you will not, certainly, de&s;erve the character of &s;ober-minded, unle&s;s you often think &s;eriou&s;ly of the&s;e things;&mdash;approaching death, the immortality of your &s;ouls, the righteous judgment of God, and the unfading, eternal joys, or the unutterable woes, which will be the con&s;equence of that deci&s;ive judgment.</P>
<P>THERE are many other things nece&s;&s;ary for the illu&s;tration of chri&s;tian &s;obriety: Of which in the next di&s;cour&s;e. But</P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude, my young brethren, without cautioning you again&s;t pride, vanity and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency; than which there is nothing more repugnant to true &s;obriety. Con&s;ider your|&s;elves at all times as the degenerate off-&s;pring of Adam. Con&s;ider the narrowne&s;s, weakne&s;s, and great imperfection of your intellectual faculties; how naturally-dark your minds are, as you come into the world; how little you really know at pre&s;ent, how much you are wholly ignorant of, and will be, &s;hould you live ever &s;o long. Con&s;ider the moral depravation of your minds; your pronene&s;s to vice; the many &s;ins and fol|lies which you have been guilty of, from your early childhood; how ju&s;tly you might be con|demned by Him, that is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity; who chargeth even his angels with folly, and in who&s;e &s;ight the heavens are not clean. Con&s;ider the need which you have,
<PB N="80" REF="009440_0095_0F74910B72106800">
both of clean&s;ing from the filthine&s;s of the fle&s;h and &s;pirit, and of pardon, through the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If you entertain &s;uch &s;entiments as the&s;e; if you think thus &s;oberly of your&s;elves, it will be a good &s;tep towards that &s;obriety of mind to which you are exhorted. But there will be but little ground of hope re&s;|pecting you, if you are vain and proud; if you are puffed up with an high opinion of your&s;elves; of your own knowledge, innocence and virtue, or your righteou&s;ne&s;s in the &s;ight of God&mdash;In &s;aying the&s;e things, you doubtle&s;s perceive on one hand, that I do not mean to flatter you in any evil or fal&s;e way. You may be equally a&s;|&s;ured on the other hand, that I do not mean to reproach and revile you; but only to repre&s;ent the &s;imple truth to you, that you may now acquaint your&s;elves with God, and be at peace; &s;o that good may come unto you in the end.</P>
<P>LET me al&s;o, in conformity to what has been &s;aid before, caution you again&s;t tho&s;e fond and groundle&s;s conceits about worldly happine&s;s, par|ticularly in the gratification of your &s;en&s;ual lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, which the minds of the young are &s;o commonly filled with; while they neglect that pious and virtuous practice, in which alone true felicity is to be found. Such imaginations as tho&s;e, are mere dreams, or the delu&s;ions of him that is &s;aid to be a liar and murderer from the beginning, on account of his tempting our fir&s;t parents with the fair forbidden fruit; telling them that they &s;hould not &s;urely die by eating of it, but become happy and immortal as gods. The like delu&s;ions he practi&s;es from age to age with &s;uc|ce&s;s,

<P>MY fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e upon this &s;ubject con|tained &s;uch ob&s;ervations as were tho't proper by way of introduction to the main de&s;ign. What that was, has al&s;o been &s;hewn already; and not only &s;o, but entered up on in the &s;econd and la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e. It will now be proper ju&s;t to remind you, that the FIRST part of that de&s;ign, was,</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="009440_0098_0F74910DE8F7A7D8">
SOMEWHAT di&s;tinctly to explain to my young brethren, the nature of that &s;obriety which is &s;poken of in the text; and to recommend it to them in a cur&s;ory way.</P>
<P>IN pur&s;uance of which branch of it, divers re|marks have already been made upon the nature of &s;obriety, con&s;idered both internally and exter|nally; and more particularly, the three follow|ing, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. THAT it is founded in a firm belief of God's being and perfections, his moral govern|ment, and univer&s;al providence.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT it implies a belief of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, or the Chri&s;tian revelation. And</P>
<P N="3">3. That it al&s;o implies, thinking &s;oberly of One's &s;elf.</P>
<P>THESE things were as di&s;tinctly explained as I could well do it, unle&s;s I had &s;pent more time upon them. And, without any further repeti|tion, I &s;hall now proceed, by divine permi&s;&s;ion and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to &s;ome other particulars compre|hended in <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> &s;obriety: For as to any o|ther &s;obriety, my young brethren, whether real or imaginary, we &s;hall now have no concern with it. To proceed, therefore.</P>
<P>IV. THIS &s;obriety &s;uppo&s;es and implies in it, &s;incere repentance; &s;uch a repentance as the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles preached to the world. In the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e I mentioned to you, thinking &s;oberly of your&s;elves, as a ne|ce&s;&s;ary ingredient in true &s;obriety of mind: And that, as was then &s;hewn, implies a &s;erious con|&s;ideration of the darkne&s;s and depravity of mind
<PB N="84" REF="009440_0099_0F749007401B2538">
which are common to you with the re&s;t of man|kind. It al&s;o implies a con&s;ideration of your pa&s;t &s;ins and mi&s;carriages; and of the &s;tate of guilt which you are in, in con&s;equence of having tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed God's commandments. But &s;omething beyond this, is implied in repentance. Let me, therefore, &s;hew, as briefly as may be, what the holy &s;criptures intend hereby. And,</P>
<P>IN general, repentance properly &s;ignifies a change of &s;entiment, of mind and di&s;po&s;ition, in con&s;equence of reflection; an after-wi&s;dom in One that has been in error and vice; and, in one word, the conver&s;ion, i. e. the turning of his heart from &s;in and folly to righteou&s;ne&s;s and wi&s;dom,&mdash;from the power of &s;atan unto God. This, in general, is the true &s;criptural idea of re|pentance; as it is, indeed, explained by the&s;e &s;cripture-expre&s;&s;ions, <Q>repentance from dead works, and repentance towards God</Q>. But, more particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. REPENTANCE implies a &s;en&s;e of having erred from the paths of truth and virtue; or a conviction of the mind and con&s;cience, that a per&s;on has done ami&s;s; that he has done what he ought not to have done, and neglected tho&s;e things which he was in rea&s;on bound to do. Some per&s;ons have indeed been much more cri|minal than others: their deviations from their duty have been more numerous, and their faults of a more heinous nature. But all are in &s;ome degree culpable. And no per&s;on ever did, or can repent, without being fir&s;t convinced of his errors.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="85" REF="009440_0100_0F749008032B37E0">
2. REPENTANCE Implies, not only a &s;en&s;e of having done ami&s;s, but of having therein tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed God's commandments, which are holy, ju&s;t and good: Or, in other words, of having &s;inned again&s;t God. Even an athei&s;t, continning &s;uch, may be convinced of his having tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the laws of right rea&s;on, and of ju&s;|tice; but he cannot repent; which implies a conviction of the mind that One has &s;inned again&s;t God, or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed his laws, con&s;idered as &s;uch: "For &s;in is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law" of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. REPENTANCE implies &s;hame, and remor&s;e of con&s;cience. And this is, indeed, very clo&s;ely connected with a conviction of mind, that One has violated the commandments of the all-wi&s;e, holy and good God. The penitent &s;inner finds him&s;elf pierced and wounded at the heart; or, in the language of &s;cripture, "pricked in the heart", as with a poi&s;oned arrow, or a deadly dart.</P>
<P N="4">4. IT implies &s;elf-condemnation, a &s;en&s;e of ill-de&s;ert, an apprehen&s;ion of God's righteous di&s;|plea&s;ure, and fear of "the wrath to come," However ea&s;y or &s;ecure the &s;inner were before, yet when the holy law of God, and his own &s;ins are at once brought into his view, the very &s;ight is as it were mortal to him. This is the two-fold &s;tate, or rather, the&s;e are the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;tates of mind, which the apo&s;tle Paul repre&s;ents in the emphatical words following: "I was alive with|out the law once; but when the commandment came, &s;in revived, and I died."</P>
<P N="5">5. THO' repentance implies remor&s;e of con|&s;cience, and &s;elf-condemnation, it is e&s;&s;entially
<PB N="86" REF="009440_0101_0F749008B3174CC8">
different from di&s;pair. True repentance is ever attended with a degree of hope towards God; de&s;pair implies a fear of wrath void of hope, which is the &s;tate of devils. That carries the &s;oul to God, as a merciful and gracious being, who delighteth not in the death of &s;inners: This drives it from him, and plunges the &s;inner into a &s;tate of greater guilt and mi&s;ery than he was in before. The de&s;pairing &s;inner has, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, both his eyes fixed on the holy law, or ju&s;tice of God: The true penitent, but one of his; the other being turned on God's mercy, or grace, manife&s;ted in the go&s;pel. So that repentance and faith, tho' often treated of di&s;tinctly, and tho' really di&s;tinct in &s;ome re&s;pects, mutually infer and imply each other, when we &s;peak of that repentance and faith which are truly evangelical.</P>
<P N="6">6. TRUE repentance implies an ingenuous &s;orrow for, and hatred of all &s;in in general, as it is mo&s;t unrea&s;onable in it&s;elf, and contrary to the holy nature of God; not merely as it ex|po&s;es the &s;inner to his wrath and cur&s;e.</P>
<P N="7">7. IT is, accordingly, attended with a &s;incere and fixed re&s;olution, by God's grace and help, to for&s;ake all the known ways of vice and folly without exception. If I may &s;o expre&s;s it, re|pentance outs "of the right hand," and "plucks out the right eye": It &s;evers betwixt the heart and every former lu&s;t, how beloved &s;oever; or how &s;overeign an empire &s;oever it once main|tained over the blinded and en&s;laved &s;oul.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="87" REF="009440_0102_0F749009D5EEFD80">
9. THE &s;incere penitent is re&s;olved, not only that he will "cea&s;e to do evil", but by God's grace, "learn to do well"; and live in obedience to all his commandments.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be farther ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="10">10. THAT &s;uch a repentance as this, which is the gift of God by the mini&s;try of the go&s;|pel, under the conduct and influence of his Holy Spirit, con&s;titutes that renewed &s;tate of mind, which the &s;criptures expre&s;s by a "new heart", being "born again", the "new creature", the "new man", and the like.</P>
<P>Now true repentance is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to true &s;obriety of mind. Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t preached the nece&s;&s;ary of it him&s;elf, &s;aying, "Except ye repent, ye &s;hall all&mdash;peri&s;h". He commanded his apo&s;tles to do the &s;ame thro' out the world, with this addition, that the re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be proclaimed at the &s;ame time in his name. This he did, in the mo&s;t ex|plicit manner, not till after his re&s;urrection; as in the following words: <Q>Thus it behoved Chri&s;t to &s;uffer, and to ri&s;e again the third day. And that repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins &s;hould be preached in his name among all nations&mdash;And ye are witne&s;&s;es of the&s;e things. And behold I &s;end the promi&s;e of my Father upon you: but tarry ye&mdash;untill ye be endued with power from on high<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke 24 46-49.</NOTE>.</Q> The apo&s;tles punctually followed his directions in this, as in other re&s;pects. For immediately after they had received "the promi&s;e of the Father",&mdash;the
<PB N="88" REF="009440_0103_0F74900A32526E58">
Holy Gho&s;t &s;ent down from heaven in confor|mity to his promi&s;e, on the day of penteco&s;t, we find them preaching thus; <Q>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts II. 38.</NOTE></Q>: And again &s;oon after, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, thus: <Q>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your &s;ins may be blotted out&mdash;</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ch. III. 19.</NOTE> They did the like wherever they preached, whether to Jews or Gentiles. And accordingly the apo&s;tle Paul, giving an account of his own doctrine, does it in this comprehen&s;ive manner: "Te&s;ti|fying both to the Jews," &s;aith he, "and al&s;o to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ch. XX. 21.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>CERTAINLY then, you cannot imagine your|&s;elves &s;ober-minded, without that repentance which Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles taught thus, as a grand, fundamental part of the religion of &s;inful creatures. Be a&s;&s;ured that, whatever you may believe concerning God and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, concerning the common degeneracy of mankind, or any other matter, you will yet be the &s;ubjects of no &s;obriety de&s;erving the name of Chri&s;tian, without godly &s;orrow for your own &s;ins re&s;pectively, and a deep repentance; &s;uch an one, in general, as was briefly de&s;cribed before; and particularly &s;uch an one, the con&s;e|quence of which &s;hall be the actual for&s;aking of every known wicked practice. If you have no other &s;obriety of mind, than what will con&s;i&s;t with an habitual indulgence of your lu&s;ts, this is
<PB N="89" REF="009440_0104_0F74900BB86D2120">
a &s;trange &s;ort of &s;obriety indeed; &s;uch as neither the &s;criptures, nor common &s;en&s;e, knows any thing of. What a &s;oleci&s;m would it be, to &s;peak of a &s;o|ber-minded young man, &s;till "walking in the way of his heart, and in the &s;ight of his eyes;" and re&s;olved in tho&s;e wicked cour&s;es, for which God has po&s;itively declared, he "will bring him into judgment"? You would not, &s;urely, think it any commendation of you, to be characteri&s;ed as &s;o|ber young men, and then to have your &s;obriety explained after this manner: You would imme|diately and ju&s;tly conclude, that you were re|proached in the bitter language of &s;arca&s;m and irony&mdash;And God grant, there may be very few <HI>&s;uch</HI> &s;ober-minded young men among&s;t us! Im|agine not therefore, you have any &s;obriety that is worthy the name, till you have repented of all your &s;ins in du&s;t and a&s;hes; till you find in your&s;elves a fixed re&s;olution to for&s;ake them; till you implore the forgivene&s;s of them with truly broken and contrite hearts; till you ca&s;t your&s;elves on the grace of God as manife&s;ted thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;aying in the humble &s;pirit of the Publican, "God be merciful to me a &s;inner!" Nor, in a word, till you internally and truly con|&s;ent to that method of &s;alvation which the go&s;pel reveals. Every thing &s;hort of this, will leave you de&s;titute of chri&s;tian &s;obriety.</P>
<P>AND this leads me to &s;peak a little more di|&s;tinctly than I have hitherto done, of that faith which the &s;criptures &s;peak of as having the re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, ju&s;tification and eternal life con|nected with it. Which faith, tho' it includes, yet certainly intends much more than, what is
<PB N="90" REF="009440_0105_0F74900CD5E0B158">
u&s;ually called a &s;peculative belief of the chri&s;tian revelation; the nece&s;&s;ity of which latter, was &s;poken of in the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>To proceed therefore,</P>
<P>V. CHRISTIAN &s;obriety of mind, implies in it that faith, which is often &s;poken of in &s;crip|ture as ju&s;tifying and &s;aving. Let me explain this matter to you under the following ob&s;ervations: For a thing of &s;o great importance ought not to pa&s;&s;ed over with a cur&s;ory mention of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. SINFUL men, as &s;uch, need a mediator between God and them; a redeemer and &s;avi|our from &s;in and death. God is, indeed, per|fect in goodne&s;s and mercy, even e&s;&s;entially, or in his own nature. But according to the repre|&s;entations of &s;cripture, it was not con&s;i&s;tent with his wi&s;dom and maje&s;ty, or the dignity of his laws, and the honor of his government; (the due &s;upport of which, by the way, is actually for the good and happine&s;s of the intelligent creation in general) It was not con&s;i&s;tent herewith, I &s;ay, for God to overlook, or to forgive the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of men, without the intervention of a mediator; who &s;hould do and &s;uffer what might have a tendency, and be &s;ufficient to vindicate the honor of his laws, by exciting and pre&s;erving in all, a ju&s;t veneration for his government, at the &s;ame time that guilty creatures were made partakers of his lenity and grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Son of God, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is the one and only per&s;on, who &s;u&s;tains this character of a mediator betwixt God and &s;inners. <Q>For there is one God, and one mediator be|tween
<PB N="91" REF="009440_0106_0F74900D402425E8">

<P N="3">3.

4. GOD him&s;elf having appointed his Son to the mediatorial office, there can be no doubt but that he is in all re&s;pects duly qualified for it: And <Q>able to &s;ave them unto the uttermo&s;t, that come unto God by him. To which end, it plea&s;ed the Father that in him &s;hould all ful|ne&s;s dwell</Q>.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE holy &s;criptures frequently &s;peak of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as &s;u&s;taining a threefold character, or relation to mankind; and as exe|cuting three high and important offices in the capacity of a mediator between God and men. He was <Q>a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people</Q>. He is the high prie&s;t, the "great high prie&s;t of our pro|fe&s;&s;ion": And he reigns as a king; God having "given him all power in heaven and in earth"; or <Q>put all things under his feet, and [particu|larly] given him to be head over all things to the church.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 1. 22.</NOTE></P>
<P N="6">6. THE revealed method of obtaining the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, deliverance from wrath, and a title to eternal life, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is mo&s;t u&s;ually expre&s;&s;ed in the new te&s;tament by the terms "faith", "believing" on him, "receiving him," and "coming to him."&mdash;"That who&s;o|ever <HI>believeth</HI> on him, &s;hould not peri&s;h," &amp;c.&mdash;"Ye are all the children of God by <HI>faith</HI> in Chri&s;t Je&s;us."&mdash;"As many as <HI>received</HI> him, to them gave he power" [the high and glorious privilege] "to become the &s;ons of God, even to them that <HI>believe</HI> on his name."&mdash;"Ye will

not <HI>come unto me,</HI> that ye might have life."&mdash;<HI>Come unto me</HI> all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t." The&s;e various expre&s;&s;ions are undoubtedly &s;ynonimous, or &s;ig|nify in general the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P N="7">7. THESE expre&s;&s;ions being compared with other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, and the whole tenor of the new te&s;tament, can intend nothing &s;hort of a &s;incere acquie&s;ence in, or a&s;&s;ent and con&s;ent of the heart to, that method of &s;alvation which is revealed thro' Chri&s;t: For it is <Q>with the heart that man believeth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s</Q>. So that the faith which in &s;cripture is &s;aid to ju&s;tify and &s;ave, might be defined in the following man|ner, conformably to the foregoing remarks; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Faith is the act of a &s;elf-condemned, humbled and repenting &s;inner, flying to, and ca&s;ting him|&s;elf upon the free grace of God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; whom he tru&s;ts with the concerns of his &s;oul, as the only, and every-way &s;ufficient Saviour of &s;inners, provided and appointed by the Father; internally receiving and &s;ubmitting to him in the <HI>whole</HI> of that character, as he is revealed in the go&s;pel, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> as a prophet, prie&s;t and king: Which faith implies in it the new birth, or the renovation of the heart, and is a living, operative principle of love and obedience; never failing, when there is time and opportunity for it, to produce good works, or a virtuous, holy and godly life.&mdash;Let me di&s;tinctly, tho' briefly, explain the &s;everal parts of this definition.</P>
<P>THAT faith which has forgivene&s;s, ju&s;tification and &s;alvation connected with it, then, is an
<PB N="94" REF="009440_0109_0F74900F74BBF830">
"act"; the act of the &s;oul, or mind. In which re&s;pect it agrees with believing, a&s;&s;enting, or con|&s;enting, in any other ca&s;e whatever: all which are real acts or operations of the mind. Our Saviour him&s;elf calls believing a "work," in an&s;wer to that que&s;tion, "What &s;hall we do, that we might work the <HI>works</HI> of God"?&mdash;"This is the <HI>work</HI> of God," &s;aid he, <Q><HI>that</HI> YE <HI>believe</HI> on him, whom he hath &s;ent.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John VI. 28, 29.</NOTE> Moreover,</P>
<P>IT is the act of "a &s;elf-condemned, hum|bled and repenting &s;inner." None but &s;uch an one can, in the nature of the thing, truly believe in Chri&s;t as the &s;aviour of &s;inners, or have any de&s;ire, how much need &s;oever he may have, to be &s;aved by him. It is, accordingly, tho&s;e that "labor and are heavy laden" with a &s;en&s;e of &s;in, that Chri&s;t invites to come unto him, or believe on him, &s;aying,&mdash;"And I will give you re&s;t."</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P>IT is the act of &s;uch a &s;inner, "flying to, and ca&s;ting him&s;elf upon the free grace of God." It is implied in his being "&s;elf-condemned," &amp;c. that he tru&s;ts not in him&s;elf, or in any innocence or righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own: So that all his hopes mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily terminate at la&s;t, or the mere grace and mercy of God. And faith is that act of the &s;oul, by which it has recour&s;e to this mercy, or humbly depends upon the God of all grace, for pardon and &s;alvation. But</P>
<P>IT is on the mercy, or free grace of God "in Je&s;us Chri&s;t." that the repenting &s;inner thus ca&s;ts him&s;elf by faith. However certain it may
<PB N="95" REF="009440_0110_0F749010409696C8">
be upon principles of rea&s;on only, that God is a good and merciful being; yet the true believer tru&s;ts in his mercy, as it is revealed and ma|nife&s;ted thro' Chri&s;t; "coming unto God by him."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 7. 25.</NOTE></P>
<P>AGAIN: He ca&s;ts him&s;elf on the grace of God in Chri&s;t, whom he al&s;o "tru&s;ts with the concerns of his &s;oul." Faith implies a &s;inner's relying or depending upon the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t as a Redeemer and Saviour. And that, in the next place,</P>
<P>AS the "only, and every-way &s;ufficient Savi|our of &s;inners." The true, penitent believer does not doubt of Chri&s;t's being in all re&s;pects a &s;uitable and adequate Saviour of &s;inful men: (For to do &s;o, is the e&s;&s;ence of infidelity.) And as the only one, in conformity to the apo&s;tle's words, "Neither is there &s;alvation in any other."</P>
<P>Moreover,</P>
<P>HE tru&s;ts in him thus, as the Saviour "provi|ded and appointed by the <HI>Father.</HI>" This is im|plied in what was &s;aid before; and &s;o needs not to be in&s;i&s;ted on. Only it &s;hould always be re|membered, that Chri&s;t does every thing in the affair of man's &s;alvation, in conformity to the &s;overeign and gracious plea&s;ure of God, even the Father&mdash;"Who gave him&s;elf for our &s;ins," &s;ays the apo&s;tle&mdash;"according to the will of God and our Father."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. 1. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE penitent believer in Chri&s;t as a Saviour, does at the &s;ame time, and thereby, "internally receive and &s;ubmit to him in the <HI>whole</HI> of that
<PB N="96" REF="009440_0111_0F74901107637AC0">
character, as he is revealed in the go&s;pel." Chri&s;t, as a Saviour, is not divided, nor are his offices or benefits divided. Neither does chri&s;tian or &s;aving faith re&s;pect him, con&s;idered in one of his capa|cities exclu&s;ively of the other; but in all of them in conjunction; as the one undivided mediator, in conformity to the doctrine of the go&s;pel; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>"As a prophet, prie&s;t and king." Now, in|ternally to receive and &s;ubmit to him as a "pro|phet", is to con&s;ider and regard him as &s;uch; to give intire credit to what&s;oever he has &s;aid, &s;o far as it is known; &s;incerely to de&s;ire to "learn of him", and to be in&s;tructed by him in the things which pertain to the kingdom of God. As faith re&s;pects him in his "prie&s;tly" office, it means depending upon the mercy of God for pardon and &s;alvation through his &s;acrifice, atone|ment, or blood &s;hed upon the cro&s;s, and his in|terce&s;&s;ion with the Father in con&s;equence there|of. And faith, as it re&s;pects him in his regal or "kingly" character, means &s;ubjection, or duti|ful and loyal &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of heart to him, his au|thority and government; or a &s;incere con&s;ent of the mind to be ruled and governed, as well as protected, and finally &s;aved by him, Nor did ever any per&s;on <HI>properly</HI> receive and &s;ubmit to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or believe on him, in any one of the&s;e characters, (&s;uch is their connection) without doing &s;o with re&s;pect to them all.</P>
<P>Again:</P>
<P>SUCH a faith as this, implies or connotes <Q>the new birth, or that renovation of the the heart</Q> by the Spirit of God, &s;o often &s;po|ken

however, that a &s;inner is no &s;ooner the &s;ub|ject of &s;uch a faith, than he is actually in a &s;tate of pardon, ju&s;tification and &s;alvation, whether he lives afterwards to perform good works, or not. If he lives, he certainly will perform them, having &s;uch an holy and ope|rative principle in his heart. For it is a con|tradiction to &s;uppo&s;e, that a per&s;on who was once a rebel, &s;hould at length internally &s;ub|mit him&s;elf to Je&s;us Chri&s;t as his king, and yet not act as becomes a loyal &s;ubject of his kingdom, by doing his commandments. But if he has no opportunity for this, by rea&s;on of death, he is yet equally &s;afe, equally ju&s;ti|fied: His faith; the loyalty and obedience of his heart, virtually contain all good works. And, by the way, from this &s;criptural account of the faith which ju&s;tifies and &s;aves, appears the great error of tho&s;e, who &s;peak of ju&s;tifi|cation as antecedent to repentance, &s;aith and regeneration; it being manife&s;tly &s;ub&s;equent, or po&s;terior thereto, in order and conception, according to the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>SUCH, my young brethren, is that faith, &s;o much &s;poken of in the new te&s;tament; that faith which is truly ju&s;tifying and &s;aving; and without which there is no &s;alvation. For he that doth not believe thus, or in the true &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, is "condemned already." No kind or degree of repentance or reforma|tion, intitles any per&s;on to &s;alvation, inde|pendently of faith: It is by means of this
<PB N="99" REF="009440_0114_0F7490145BB44CE8">
faith, which indeed includes or &s;uppo&s;es re|pentance, that &s;inners are delivered from con|demnation and wrath. This, therefore, is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, in order to your be|ing &s;ober-minded in a chri&s;tian &s;en&s;e. Who|ever falls &s;hort of this, falls &s;hort of chri&s;tian &s;obriety. For &s;urely, <HI>that</HI> cannot be a truly chri&s;tian &s;obriety of mind, which leaves a &s;inner in a &s;tate of guilt and condemnation. Any &s;obriety which a per&s;on may be the &s;ub|ject of, and yet peri&s;h in his &s;ins at la&s;t, as a de&s;pi&s;er or neglecter of the &s;alvation revealed thro' Chri&s;t, is e&s;&s;entially defective.</P>
<P>WHATEVER concern then, you may have upon your minds about your pa&s;t &s;ins; tho' your external practice may be much reform|ed; and tho' you may be really de&s;irous of eternal happine&s;s; (as who is not?) Yet if you do not give the con&s;ent of your hearts to be &s;aved by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the way that the go&s;pel makes known; if you do not &s;in|cerely, penitently and humbly ca&s;t your&s;elves on the mercy of God, receiving and &s;ubmit|ting to Chri&s;t as a prophet, prie&s;t and king; you are not &s;ober-minded in the full and ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the text: You are not yet actually in the &s;piritual kingdom of Chri&s;t and of God, tho' you may not be far from, but near to it, and in a hopeful way of finally inheriting the ble&s;&s;ings of it. This is not, however, a &s;tate to be re&s;ted in as &s;afe or &s;ecure. If you are burthened with a &s;en&s;e of &s;in and

<P>YOU will ob&s;erve, that what has been &s;aid under this head of di&s;cour&s;e, relates immedi|ately, not to your external practice, but to that faith which is truly &s;aving, and is it|&s;elf the &s;ub&s;tance or e&s;&s;ence of Chri&s;tian &s;o|briety internally con&s;idered; the root and principle of all true holine&s;s, or Chri&s;tian obedience.</P>

of the words, or in con&s;i&s;tency with the practice of the chri&s;tian church from the earlie&s;t times.</P>
<P N="4">4. UNDER this head, I mu&s;t not omit par|ticularly to mention the chri&s;tian ordinance of bapti&s;m, which our Lord in&s;tituted as the outward, vi&s;ible &s;ign of initiation into his church, or a mark of di&s;ciple&s;hip to him; &s;aying to his apo&s;tles, <Q>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth: Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. 28. 18, 19.</NOTE>. The known practice of the apo&s;tles afterwards, being compared with this injunction, &s;hews that our Lord de&s;igned <HI>water-bapti&s;m</HI> therein. For, that they actually baptized with water, is e|vident from many pa&s;&s;ages in the new-te&s;ta|ment; not only in the Acts, but Epi&s;tles of the apo&s;tles: And doubtle&s;s they did &s;o in obedience to Chri&s;t's command, which they under&s;tood much better than the modern de|niers of water-bapti&s;m. Mr. Robert Barclay has de&s;cended to cavil and trifle upon this &s;ub|ject, in a manner much below a per&s;on of his learning and good &s;en&s;e: A&s;&s;erting that tho' John's bapti&s;m was by or with water. Chri&s;t's was to be without water, or meerly an inter|nal and &s;piritual bapti&s;m. His principal ar|gument to e&s;tabli&s;h this doctrine, is grounded on the words of John Bapti&s;t him&s;elf: <Q>I
<PB N="105" REF="009440_0120_0F749018774C8A38">
indeed baptize you with water unto repen|tance; but he that cometh after me&mdash;&s;hall baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t and with fire</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. III. 11.</NOTE>. According to which di&s;tinction and oppo&s;ition, he in&s;i&s;ts, that as John's bapti&s;m was by water without the Spirit, &s;o chri&s;tian bapti&s;m is &s;olely by the Spirit without water: So that there neither is, nor ought to be, any bapti&s;m under the Go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, and in conformity to Chri&s;t's commandment, be&s;ides that of the Spirit, or the Holy Gho&s;t; this be|ing it &s;elf, and this alone, chri&s;tian bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>To overthrow which &s;ophi&s;m, I need re|mind you only of two pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, both in the Acts of the apo&s;tles. Soon after they them&s;elves were baptized with the <Q>Ho|ly Gho&s;t and with fire</Q> i. e. received the Spirit, which appeared to them in the form of "cloven tongues, like as of fire"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts II. 3.</NOTE>; we find them preaching thus to the people: <Q>Re|pent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, <HI>and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the Ho|ly Gho&s;t</HI></Q><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 38.</NOTE>. According to which, the Holy Gho&s;t was to be given them in <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of their being baptized in the name of Chri&s;t. Therefore receiving chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, and receiving the Holy Gho&s;t, do not mean pre|ci&s;ely the &s;ame thing, as it is pretended; one of them being prior to the other, and a means thereof. And what could that be, but water|bapti&s;m
<PB N="106" REF="009440_0121_0F749019445E6498">
in Chri&s;t's name, in <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of which, the per&s;ons baptized were to receive &s;piritual bapti&s;m, or the Holy Gho&s;t?</P>
<P>BUT there is another pa&s;&s;age which &s;till more clearly refutes the learned Barclay's comment upon the above-cited words of John. We are informed that St. Paul <Q>came to E|phe&s;us, and finding certain di&s;ciples, he &s;aid unto them, Have ye received the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ince ye believed? And they &s;aid, We have not &s;o much as heard whether there be any Holy Gho&s;t. And he &s;aid unto them, Unto what then were ye bap|tized? And they &s;aid, Unto John's bap|ti&s;m.</Q> Be plea&s;ed particularly to ob&s;erve what immediately follows, in which there is an expre&s;s reference to the words of John: <Q>Then &s;aid Paul, John verily baptized with the bapti&s;m of repentance, &s;aying unto the people, That they &s;hould believe on him which &s;hould come after him, that is, on Chri&s;t Je&s;us. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Je|&s;us. <HI>And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Gho&s;t came upon them</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xix. 1&mdash;6.</NOTE></Q>. Now, could there po&s;&s;ibly be a plainer di&s;tinction than this, either, fir&s;t, betwixt John's bapti&s;m, and bapti&s;m in Chri&s;t's name afterwards; or, &s;econdly, betwixt the&s;e per&s;ons being baptized in Chri&s;t's name, and their receiving the Ho|ly Gho&s;t? This was &s;ub&s;equent to the other,
<PB N="107" REF="009440_0122_0F74901A1790FD50">
and not till after Paul had laid his hands on, as well as baptized them. Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m then, and receiving the Holy Gho&s;t, were not the &s;ame thing; but the former of them, ordinarily at lea&s;t, prior to the latter, and an in&s;tituted means thereof: And what could that be, but water-bapti&s;m? Whereas, upon Mr. Barclay's principles, it was John's bap|ti&s;m only, that was by water; Chri&s;t's being entirely &s;piritual.</P>
<P>UPON the whole then, the plain &s;en&s;e of John's word's, on which &s;o much &s;tre&s;s has been laid by the Quakers, may be expre&s;&s;ed thus&mdash;I indeed baptize you with water [only] unto repentance: But Je&s;us Chri&s;t will &s;oon in&s;titute another bapti&s;m, which, tho' per|formed by an external wa&s;hing with water, as mine is, &s;hall yet have far more glorious effects. For penitent believers in Chri&s;t, be|ing baptized in conformity to his in&s;titution, &s;hall, in con&s;equence thereof, receive the Holy Gho&s;t&mdash;There is nothing har&s;h in this para|phra&s;e; the difference betwixt John's and Chri&s;t's bapti&s;m is &s;ufficiently pre&s;erved there|by; and there is a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uch an one, in order to account for the apo&s;tles baptizing with water, as they certainly did. Let me add, that if this be an in&s;tituted means of ob|taining the Holy Spirit, it may be ju&s;tly fear|ed that tho&s;e who neglect and de&s;pi&s;e it, have &s;ome what <HI>le&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> among them, than they would be tho't to have: Tho' I do

not pre&s;ume to judge any; for to his own ma&s;ter every one &s;tandeth or falleth.</P>
<P>YOUR duty then, in this re&s;pect, is clear: All who believe in Chri&s;t, not having al|ready been baptized with water, are obliged to be &s;o, in obedience to his command.&mdash;Tho' as to the far greater part of you, my young brethren of this &s;ociety; I conclude you were baptized in your infancy: So that you are not to be exhorted to be again baptiz|ed. But there are many of you, who have not yet made this as it were your own act, by vi&s;ibly taking upon your&s;elves the bonds of the chri&s;tian covenant. And the neglect hereof, in tho&s;e that are come to adult age, is not very con&s;i&s;tent with chri&s;tian &s;obriety. Nor can you be tho't to have <HI>your&s;elves</HI> con|fe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;t before men, in the manner re|quired by him, by being devoted to him by your <HI>parents</HI> or <HI>others,</HI> in your infancy.</P>
<P N="5">5. THERE is a con&s;iderable number of tho&s;e that may be ju&s;tly accounted young men, tho' not unmarried, who, in order to obtain bapti&s;m for their children, have made a pro|fe&s;&s;ion of their faith in Chri&s;t, and &s;olemnly bound them&s;elves to ob&s;erve <HI>all</HI> the laws of his kingdom; and yet turn their backs upon the Lord's table from year to year, as if this were no chri&s;tian in&s;titution;&mdash;as tho' Chri&s;t had never &s;aid, <Q>This do in remembrance of me</Q>; and as tho' the in&s;pired apo&s;tle had not &s;aid, <Q>As oft as ye eat of this bread,

and drink of this cup, ye do &s;hew the Lord's death, <HI>till he come.</HI></Q> It is not very ea&s;y to reconcile this neglect, with the &s;uppo&s;ition of your having been <HI>&s;incere</HI> and <HI>in earne&s;t,</HI> when you engaged to obey all Chri&s;t's known com|mandments and in&s;titutions;&mdash;upon &s;uppo&s;i|tion that you allow this to be one of them, as you cannot deny it to be. I have often, and very particularly &s;hewn what your duty is in this re&s;pect; tho' with much le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s than was de&s;ired. However, I will not be weary or di&s;couraged in reminding you of it; hop|ing that the time will come, when what is &s;eriou&s;ly &s;aid to you upon this head, will be as &s;eriou&s;ly attended to; and have a proper influence upon your practice: Which will be a better evidence of your being truly &s;ober-minded, than any that you can well give, while you habitually ab&s;ent your&s;elves from the fellow&s;hip of Chri&s;t's church and people in one of his ordinances.</P>
<P>INDEED, if <HI>unchri&s;tian</HI> terms of chri&s;tian communion are in&s;i&s;ted on in any church or churches, your not being incorporated with them, provided it is &s;olely for this rea&s;on, will not be your fault, but that of the impo|&s;ers of &s;uch terms.

<P>BUT, &s;urely, it is time that all prote&s;tants, e&s;pecially prote&s;tant-di&s;&s;enters, &s;hould make the holy &s;criptures the &s;tandard of a &s;ound faith and chri&s;tian practice, in oppo&s;ition to ALL OTHER <HI>forms of &s;ound words;</HI> as &s;ome are plea&s;ed to mis-call the reveries of poor crazy monks and lunaticks, half-di&s;tracted &s;choolmen, &s;uperannuated enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and proud, factious, avaritious zealots for a party, pretending to make black white, and white black; and then &s;colding at, and cur&s;ing all the world, that would not implicitly believe their unholy ravings, and &s;ubmit to them as the true, uncorrupted <HI>catholic faith!</HI>&mdash;God, in his own time, which is approaching, will put an end to all the&s;e antichri&s;tian u&s;urpa|tions in his church.

rea&s;onable "liberty, wherewith Chri&s;t has made his di&s;ciples FREE from every &s;uch yoke of bondage."</P>
<P>VII. CHRISTIAN &s;obriety implies frequent and fervent prayer to almighty God in the name of Chri&s;t, for the pardon of &s;in, for the Holy Spirit, for light, &s;upport, &s;anctification, comfort; in a word, for all needed ble&s;&s;ings, temporal and eternal: Together with devout and grateful prai&s;es for all ble&s;&s;ings enjoyed of every kind, to the Father of lights, from whom "every good gift, and every perfect gift cometh down." An habitual neglect of prayer, is ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity. And if ever you are really &s;ober-minded, you will find in your|&s;elves an heart, a di&s;po&s;ition to pray, and to give thanks to <Q>God and our Father for all things, in the name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> It will not be a grievous ta&s;k or burden to you, as it is to a &s;ecure and hardened &s;inner. So far from this, that you will find your&s;elves unea&s;y if you are long without pouring out your hearts before God. You will not only pray to him in public with his people, and in a more private manner, if you have oppor|tunity; but in &s;ecret. And even when you are engaged in the lawful and nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;i|ne&s;s of life, your hearts will frequently be lifted up to God in the heavens, in holy de|&s;ires, grateful prai&s;es, and good re&s;olutions: Thus, in the language of the apo&s;tle, <Q>pray|ing
<PB N="112" REF="009440_0127_0F74901E72B36E60">
always with all prayer, and &s;upplica|tion in the Spirit, watching thereunto with per&s;everance.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. VI. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>I MIGHT mention many other particular duties, as belonging to the head of chri&s;tian &s;obriety; for, indeed, there is no one duty, but what belongs to it. But, in&s;tead of de&s;cending to more particulars, I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve now in the la&s;t place,</P>
<P>VIII. THAT chri&s;tian &s;obriety implies living a truly religious, virtuous and holy life, in conformity to the precepts of the go&s;|pel, the laws of Chri&s;t's kingdom. Our Lord frequently cautioned his di&s;ciples again&s;t de|pending upon an external profe&s;&s;ion of faith and religion, without good works, without obedience to his commandments. <Q>Not every one that &s;aith unto me, Lord, Lord,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>&s;hall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will &s;ay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophe&s;ied in thy name, and in thy name ca&s;t out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profe&s;s unto them, I never knew you: de|part from me, ye that work iniquity</Q>.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. VII. 21, 22. 23.</NOTE> So that, whatever <HI>wonderful</HI> works men may do, yet if they neglect good works, or &s;till work <HI>iniquity,</HI> they are not true di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t. How many <HI>devils</HI> &s;oever they ca&s;t out; yet if they leave <HI>one</HI> to reign in their own hearts, &s;o
<PB N="113" REF="009440_0128_0F74901F37E2C728">
that they "do his lu&s;ts," they are mo&s;t expre&s;ly excluded from all hopes of eternal life. Indeed, living in the practice of any known &s;in, is ab&s;o|lutely incon&s;i&s;tent with true repentance, and that faith which is &s;aving, according to the account before given of them. "How &s;hall they that are dead to &s;in, live any longer therein?" Or how &s;hall they that are "alive unto God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t," not live to God, or not obey his known will in every re&s;pect! It is impo&s;&s;ible: If the tree be good, the fruit will be good; if the heart be renewed and &s;anctified, the life will al&s;o be renewed and holy. The love of God and of man, under&s;tood in their proper and ju&s;t extent, and con&s;idered as principles in the heart, the effects of Chri&s;tian faith thro' the influences of the holy Spirit, do in a &s;ort comprehend all Chri&s;tian duties and virtues. Known, wilful and habitual di&s;obedience to God in any re&s;pect, is incon&s;i&s;tent therewith; incon&s;i&s;tent with chri&s;tian &s;incerity, and therefore with &s;obriety.</P>
<P>IF, therefore, you a&s;pire to the character of be|ing &s;ober-minded, "having believed in God, you mu&s;t be careful to maintain good-works:" You mu&s;t keep his commandments in view, endea|vouring, by his grace, to glorify him in all things; to form your temper, and whole cour&s;e of life, according to tho&s;e rea&s;onable, ju&s;t and good pre|cepts which Chri&s;t has left his di&s;ciples to walk by; not forgetting his own admirable example of piety, purity and humility; of meekne&s;s and charity, of temperance and patience; nor al|lowing
<PB N="114" REF="009440_0129_0F7490200A5DDEA0">
your&s;elves in any thing which you know, or in your con&s;ciences believe, is contra|ry to the will of God. For, as was intimated before, doing &s;o, is ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with integrity and uprightne&s;s of heart, as well as with that holine&s;s of life which God has required of all whom he hath favoured with the light of the go&s;pel, and called to his eternal kingdom and glory by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I HAVE now done with the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> general head of di&s;cour&s;e propo&s;ed, having &s;omewhat di&s;tinctly explained to you the nature of that &s;obriety, to which even "young men" are to be exhorted.</P>
<P>LET me conclude for the pre&s;ent, with &s;ome &s;hort reflexions on, what has been &s;aid upon it.</P>
<P>And, 1. YOU would do well, my young bre|thren, to apply this to your&s;elves re&s;pectively, in the way of &s;erious &s;elf-examination. It becomes you to con&s;ider both your pa&s;t and pre&s;ent ways; what &s;entiments and di&s;po&s;itions are predominant in your hearts; and by what rules and maxims your lives are directed: That &s;o you may be a|ble to judge, what your own true characters re|&s;pectively are; whether you are truly religious and virtuous, or &s;ober-minded, or not. For, as has been ob&s;erved more than once, true religion, and true &s;obriety, are not really different; but e&s;&s;entially one and the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>IT &s;hall now be taken for granted, that you do not di&s;believe the being, perfections and pro|vidence of God, or the general truth of the chri&s;|tian revelation; and al&s;o, that you have &s;ome ju&s;t

conceptions of the common frailty and degene|racy of mankind. Neither of the&s;e things &s;hall in the lea&s;t be called into que&s;tion&mdash;But have you &s;incerely repented of your own &s;ins before God? Have you, in a deep &s;en&s;e of your guilt and unworthine&s;s, fled for refuge from his ju&s;tice to his grace and mercy, thro' his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and internally con&s;ented to that method of &s;alvation which is revealed in the go&s;pel? Have you al&s;o confe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;t's name before men, in the manner required by him; and vi&s;ibly dedicated your&s;elves to God in him? Do you live in the frequent practice of &s;incere and fervent prayer? And do you con&s;cientiou&s;ly endeavour to walk according to all Chri&s;t's known commandments? It would be convenient for you to put &s;uch que&s;tions as the&s;e to your&s;elves, as in the pre&s;ence of God, who is greater than your hearts, and knoweth all things.</P>
<P N="2">2. THOSE of you who can truly an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions in the affirmative, (as I hope &s;ome of you can) may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves that you are in|deed &s;ober-minded; and have great ground of comfort, peace and joy, as being the &s;ons of God, and heirs of eternal life. I might addre&s;s and congratulate you in the language of St. John, in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle:&mdash;<Q>I write unto you young men, becau&s;e ye have overcome the wicked One.</Q> And again, <Q>I have written unto you young men, becau&s;e ye are &s;trong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked One.</Q> Happy you, my beloved

<P N="3">3. BE not high-minded, but fear. A &s;ober mind, is always an humble one. Boa&s;t not of your religious attainments, as the &s;hameful and hypocritical manner of &s;ome is: And if you ever glory even in tho't, let it be only in the Lord. "For what ha&s;t thou, that thou did&s;t not receive?"

<P N="4">4. As to tho&s;e of you, my young brethren, who cannot pretend to be &s;ober-minded accord|ing to the&s;e &s;criptural marks and rules of &s;obrie|ty; you have no rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with your pre&s;ent condition, or to think it &s;afe.

But,</P>
<P N="5">5. LEST I &s;hould be mi&s;under&s;tood, I mu&s;t tell you, I do not mean hereby, that if you are deficient in any of the&s;e re&s;pects, or fall &s;hort of &s;uch a truly chri&s;tian &s;tate, you are of con&s;e|quence de&s;titute of every degree of &s;obriety that is of any con&s;ideration; and &s;o are to be ranked in the &s;ame cla&s;s with the mo&s;t profligate and aban|doned &s;inners.

And indeed, they are the effects of God's gracious influences upon the heart; in conformity to what is &s;aid of Lydia in the Acts, <Q>That the Lord <HI>opened her heart to</HI> ATTEND to tho&s;e things which were &s;poken by Paul.</Q> Our Saviour al|&s;o tells &s;uch a &s;erious, inqui&s;itive per&s;on, that he was "not far from the kingdom of God."

<P>MY young brethren, having, in the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, made &s;ome remarks on the text, introductory to my main de&s;ign; and having, in the &s;econd and third, &s;omewhat di&s;tinctly explained to you the nature of that &s;o|briety which is here &s;poken of, as al&s;o recom|mended it to you in a cur&s;ory way: I proceed now, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as was propo&s;ed in the &s;econd place,</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="009440_0137_0F749025F92E0020">
SECONDLY, To point out, particularly, &s;ome of the many &s;ins, follies and criminal exce&s;&s;es, which are repugnant to chri&s;tian &s;obriety; and again&s;t which young men e&s;pecially, may need to be cautioned.</P>
<P>THIS, it is conceived, may, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, be very &s;erviceable to you, not merely by &s;hewing you what you ought not, but what you ought to do; and &s;o giving you a &s;till more di&s;|tinct idea of chri&s;tian &s;obriety. For, to every vice that is to be avoided as contrary to this &s;obriety, there is an oppo&s;ite virtue or duty, which ought to be practi&s;ed as a branch of it: And, it is well known, that in all ca&s;es in gene|ral, contraries &s;erve for the illu&s;tration of each other. So that when you are &s;hewn what things you ought to avoid, you will the more clearly di&s;cern what that manner and cour&s;e of life is, to which you are exhorted: Nor &s;hall I fail, as I go along, particularly to remind you of the du|ties and virtues, to which the &s;ins that are to be mentioned, &s;tand in oppo&s;ition. And if &s;ome of the&s;e &s;ins and exce&s;&s;es have been hinted at al|ready in any of the preceeding di&s;cour&s;es; yet that will not render a more particular caveat with re&s;pect to them, &s;uperfluous or improper.</P>
<P>LET me farther premi&s;e, That tho' in the enu|meration of the&s;e &s;ins and follies, it is rather my intention to give you friendly warning as to the future, than to accu&s;e, reproach and upbraid you, as to any faults which you may have been guilty of in times pa&s;t; yet it will be highly pro|per for you to make the application to your&s;elves

re&s;pectively, &s;o far as you have been really guilty of any of the&s;e crimes. You ought, with &s;hame and ingenuous &s;orrow, to acknowledge them to God; humbly imploring the forgivne&s;s of them thro' Him, who once appeared to put away &s;ins by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf. For he that cover|eth his &s;ins &s;hall not pro&s;per; but who&s;o con|fe&s;&s;eth and for&s;aketh them, &s;hall find mercy with the Lord; who <Q>is not willing that ANY &s;hould peri&s;h, but that ALL &s;hould come to repen|tance.</Q>&mdash;Let me begin then,</P>
<P>I. WITH the mention of an heinous &s;in more immediately again&s;t God; I mean that of "tak|ing his name in vain." To u&s;e the name of the great and holy God irreverently or lightly in common di&s;cour&s;e; and more e&s;pecially to &s;wear by it ra&s;hly, fal&s;ely, wantonly, or without law|ful occa&s;ion; to imprecate the cur&s;e of God, either upon your&s;elves or others, whether in je&s;t or in earne&s;t; together with whatever commonly goes under the name of profane language: All the&s;e things, I &s;ay, are doubtle&s;s prohibited in that well known, and yet often violated com|mand of the decalogue, <Q>Thou &s;halt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.</Q> And the words immediately following, clearly and &s;trongly expre&s;s the high di&s;plea&s;ure of the Al|mighty again&s;t tho&s;e who break this command|ment, together with the certainty and greatne&s;s of their puni&s;hment, unle&s;s it be prevented by deep repentance&mdash;<Q>For the Lord will not hold him guiltle&s;s, that taketh his name in vain.</Q> There are many other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, in

And what religious &s;obriety, do you think, can po&s;&s;ibly be in the mind of that per&s;on, whe|ther old or young, who&s;e mouth is thus filled with cur&s;es, and other profane language?&mdash;in the mind of One, who &s;cruples not to trifle with that venerable name, at which holy angels bow with love and reverence, and devils them|&s;elves tremble, and are horribly afraid!&mdash;in the mind of One, who upon any &s;light di&s;content or unea&s;ine&s;s, or perhaps without any &s;ort of provocation, calls upon the great God to damn either him&s;elf or another, or the like? Certainly, there can be no true &s;obriety in tho&s;e per&s;ons, whoever they be, that addict them&s;elves to the&s;e practices, &s;aying perhaps with the wicked of old, "Our lips are our own; who is Lord over us?" The u&s;e of &s;uch language evidently di&s;covers the want of all due reverence to the great God, and a mind depraved to a &s;ad degree, upon any &s;up|po&s;ition that can be made. There is no tolerable excu&s;e for it; nothing that can be &s;aid by way of apology for tho&s;e that are chargeable with it,

but what will much more effectually &s;hew their great guilt and impiety. For example:</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be &s;aid, that they really mean <HI>nothing,</HI> when they lightly u&s;e the name of God, and imprecate the vengeance of heaven upon them&s;elves, which is the mo&s;t favourable &s;uppo|&s;ition; yet does it not di&s;cover a total ab&s;ence of reverence to God, and of all &s;erious concern about his favor, his ble&s;&s;ing or his cur&s;e, when people can often u&s;e his name without thinking of Him, and &s;peak of his cur&s;e, or of damnation it&s;elf, without meaning any thing thereby! What? have the name of God frequently in their mouths, and yet not have "God him&s;elf in all their thoughts!"&mdash;often &s;peak of his ble&s;&s;ing and cur&s;e, of heaven and hell; and yet not think of them, or mean any thing thereby! What a totally irreligious?&mdash;what a "reprobate," undi&s;|cerning, blinded, and mon&s;trou&s;ly depraved mind does this imply? How near is it to right down Athei&s;m? But it will perhaps be &s;aid, that tho' &s;ome per&s;ons do really think of God, of his wrath and cur&s;e, when they &s;peak of them; yet they are only <HI>in je&s;t,</HI> when they u&s;e &s;uch language, and intend not as they &s;ay. What? je&s;t with the holy and venerable name of the great God! and &s;peak of his ble&s;&s;ing and cur&s;e, of heaven and hell, for merriment and diver&s;ion! Is not this to make the matter &s;till wor&s;e? Would it not, of the two, be le&s;s criminal to have no de|&s;ign at all, than &s;uch a one as this? Doubtle&s;s it would. But you will &s;ay, perhaps, that they u&s;e &s;uch language, becau&s;e it is by &s;ome reckoned

will, and expre&s;s law of God. And it is one of tho&s;e enormous &s;ins, again&s;t which young men need to be particularly warned. It is not, in|deed, a crime that is peculiar to them. Some per&s;ons that are advanced in years, are notoriou&s;|ly guilty of it: Yea, it is &s;aid, there are <HI>certain creatures</HI> both old and young, appearing in female apparel (for I will not pro&s;titute the re&s;pec|table name of <HI>women,</HI> by giving it to them) who are no ordinary proficients in this kind of impie|ty!

The fear of the Lord is the very "beginning of wi&s;dom:" And if <HI>that</HI> finds any place in your hearts, you will have a &s;acred veneration even for his name, as well as for Him: You will never mention it, or &s;peak or think of the great GOD, but in a &s;o|ber and reverent manner.

And yet how common a thing is it to hear both old and young, and even children in the &s;treets, who can

<P>II.

<P>YOU know, doubtle&s;s, that as early as the time of Mo&s;es, i. e. above three thou&s;and years ago, God appropriated one day in &s;even to be ob&s;erved as an holy &s;abbath to him&s;elf, or a day of re&s;t from common &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s, and to be &s;pent in re|ligious exerci&s;es: Saying, <Q>Remember the &s;ab|bath-day to keep it holy.

It &s;eemed not improper to remind you of this original in&s;titution of a &s;abbath: Tho' I mu&s;t acknowledge, that I think chri&s;tians have no con|cern with <HI>the &s;abbath,</HI> mo&s;t properly &s;o called, (I mean the Mo&s;aic or Jewi&s;h &s;abbath) any more than they have with circumci&s;ion, the pa&s;&s;over, and other &s;acrifices, &amp;c. All the&s;e things were but "a &s;hadow of good things to come." And when Chri&s;t the body, the &s;ub&s;tance came;&mdash;when his church, mo&s;t properly &s;o called, in di&s;tinction from the Jewi&s;h, was e&s;tabli&s;hed, tho&s;e things cea&s;ed: At lea&s;t, the Gentile converts were under no obligation to ob&s;erve any one of them; no, not even the moral law, con&s;idered merely as a part of the law of Mo&s;es. For if they had, they would have been al&s;o bound to ob&s;erve all the others for the &s;ame rea&s;on. So that if Gen|tile Chri&s;tians are obliged to any of the things which were enjoined in the law of Mo&s;es, as they doubtle&s;s are; yet they are only tho&s;e, that are either of moral and eternal obligation, or el&s;e a|dopted, and taken into "the law of Chri&s;t," and con&s;idered as a part of his in&s;titution. The Mo&s;aic, or <HI>&s;eventh-day &s;abbath,</HI> is neither of the&s;e. If it were, properly &s;peaking, of moral obligation, it would be &s;o to all nations in all ages; univer|&s;ally and perpetually binding, &s;o that the law re|lating thereto, could no more be either <HI>repealed</HI> or <HI>changed,</HI> than tho&s;e commandments which re|quire us to love God and our neighbour. And there are few, if any per&s;ons, who pretend to &s;ay, that Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles ever enjoined Chri&s;tians to ob&s;erve the &s;eventh-day &s;abbath in|&s;tituted
<PB N="130" REF="009440_0145_0F74902D758395C0">
by Mo&s;es; making that part of the de|calogue, a part of the Chri&s;tian rule of life. Nei|ther is there, according to the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, any other &s;abbath, or day, to be ob&s;erved with a Judaical rigor and &s;everity; with which the more liberal, ingenuous and filial &s;pirit of chri&s;|tianity, very little agrees. And whoever at this day, pretends to maintain the obligation to re|gard <HI>any &s;eventh day</HI> as a &s;abbath, either upon the footing of the law of nature, or that of Mo&s;es, will have a di&s;graceful overthrow, or a very contemptible opponent.</P>
<P>UPON what footing then, you will a&s;k me, do I a&s;&s;ert an obligation to ob&s;erve "the Lord's day," or "the fir&s;t day of the week," in a religious manner? I an&s;wer, intirely upon a Chri&s;tian ba|&s;is; upon a footing quite di&s;tinct from that on which the Jewi&s;h &s;abbath was in&s;tituted and ob|&s;erved. Let me briefly explain this matter.</P>
<P>IT is in general con&s;onant to the light and law of nature, that God &s;hould be wor&s;hipped, &amp;c. in a &s;ocial, public manner. And if &s;o, it is convenient and nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;ome particu|lar <HI>times,</HI> and even <HI>places,</HI> &s;hould be more e&s;|pecially appropriated to that u&s;e, or end. For otherwi&s;e, people would not know <HI>when</HI> or <HI>where</HI> to go, in order to meet with others to join with them in the&s;e offices of religion. It evidently appears al&s;o from the new te&s;tament, to have been the will of Chri&s;t and of God, not only that &s;ocial wor&s;hip &s;hould be upheld under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, but more particularly, that "the fir&s;t day of the week," on which our

Saviour aro&s;e, and was "declared to be the Son of God with power," &s;hould be <HI>religiou&s;ly, gratefully</HI> and <HI>joyfully</HI> ob&s;erved, in prai&s;e, prayer, &amp;c. For this day is divers times mentioned in the new te&s;tament, as the day on which Chri&s;tians a&s;&s;embled together in a more e&s;pecial manner, in the fir&s;t age, for religious purpo&s;es.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Compare John XX. 1. Acts XX. 7. 1 Cor. XVI. 2. &amp; Rev. 1. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be remembered al&s;o, that the primi|tive chri&s;tians came together thus on the fir&s;t day of the week, under the immediate eye, counte|nance and direction of the in&s;pired apo&s;tles; who u&s;ed to meet and pray with, teach, exhort and preach to them, thereon: At which time al&s;o the Lord's Supper u&s;ed to be celebrated. So we read particularly, [Acts XX. 7.] <Q>And upon the fir&s;t day of the week, when the di&s;ciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>THIS example of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, con&s;ider|ing all circum&s;tances, and particularly their meet|ing on this day, under the immediate in&s;pection of, and with the in&s;pired apo&s;tles, is &s;ufficient to give that day the <HI>preference</HI> to any other, for the purpo&s;es afore&s;aid: E&s;pecially when we con&s;ider it as the day of that grand and important event, the very ba&s;is of the Chri&s;tian religion, Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection; from whence it is called "the Lord's day." Public, &s;ocial wor&s;hip being a duty, and &s;ome particular time being needful to be fixed on for that end; here are po&s;itive rea&s;ons for the fir&s;t day, rather than another: And no man can pretend any particular rea&s;on again&s;t this, or ob|ject again&s;t it; except upon the footing of the antiquated Jewi&s;h &s;abbath, with which we have

no concern&mdash;But this is only <HI>example,</HI> you will &s;ay; not <HI>precept.</HI> Now, in&s;tead of in&s;i&s;ting up|on it, as I think One might do with great rea&s;on, that this example, all circum&s;tances being con|&s;idered, ought to have the force of a command with us; I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>THAT the words of the apo&s;tle [Heb. X. 23, 24 &amp; 25,] can be con&s;idered as nothing &s;hort of a po&s;itive precept, to the purpo&s;e afore&s;aid. <Q>Let us hold fa&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of our faith without wavering&mdash;And let us con&s;ider one another to provoke unto love, and to good works: <HI>Not for&s;aking the a&s;&s;embling of our&s;elves together, as the manner of &s;ome is; but exhorting one another.</HI></Q>&mdash;Now, the&s;e words ought, in all rea|&s;on, to be under&s;tood and interpreted in confor|mity to the known general practice of the Chri&s;|tian church in that age; which was to <HI>a&s;&s;emble</HI> for the exerci&s;es of religion on "the fir&s;t day of the week" more e&s;pecially, tho' not exclu&s;ively. So that in any natural and fair con&s;truction of this pa&s;&s;age, the apo&s;tle mu&s;t be con&s;idered, (1.) As giving his intire approbation of this ge|neral u&s;age among Chri&s;tians; as one way in which they were to "hold fa&s;t their profe&s;&s;ion," to excite one another "to love, and to good works," &amp;c. (2.) As &s;olemnly warning Chri&s;|tians again&s;t neglecting to meet together for the &s;aid purpo&s;es on the fir&s;t, or Lord's day&mdash;"Not for&s;aking the a&s;&s;embling of our&s;elves to|gether." And (3.) As blaming and reproving certain of the loo&s;er, and le&s;s &s;incere profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, who even in that age ab&s;ented them|&s;elves

from the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies of the faithful&mdash;"as the manner of &s;ome is"&mdash;This is no forced or laboured, but an ea&s;y and natural con&s;truction of the apo&s;tle's words. So that this practice, &s;o rea|&s;onable in it&s;elf, and conducive to many impor|tant ends, civil and temporal, as well as religious and eternal, wants neither apo&s;tolic example nor precept for its &s;upport; and even to bind it up|on the con&s;ciences of all who acknowledge &s;ub|jection to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>WHY then &s;hould any as it were turn Jews, or become "Mo&s;es's di&s;ciples," for the &s;ake of e&s;|tabli&s;hing an illiberal, Mo&s;aic &s;abbath, to be ob|&s;erved with an un&s;criptural, Jewi&s;h, and even Phari&s;aical rigor, altogether aliene from the genius of the go&s;pel; in&s;tead of contenting them&s;elves with "the Lord's day," to be ob&s;erved with grateful prai&s;es, with religious joy and fe&s;tivity, as that day was ob&s;erved by the body of Chri&s;tians for two or three centuries at lea&s;t? What need is there for having recour&s;e to Mo&s;es and his law, for the divine in&s;titution of any &s;abbath that Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples ought to ob&s;erve! Tho', by the way, "the Lord's day" is not properly called <HI>the &s;abbath.</HI> It is never called &s;o in &s;cripture; and giving it that name &s;ince, has been the un|happy occa&s;ion of filling many people's heads with Jewi&s;h and antichri&s;tian notions about it&mdash;</P>
<P>BUT not to digre&s;s: It being plainly the will of Chri&s;t and of God, that the Lord's day &s;hould be ob&s;erved, as has been &s;hewn, entirely upon the plan of the go&s;pel; it will be an heinous &s;in in you, if you neglect the public wor&s;hip thereon;

For&s;ake not therefore, the a&s;&s;embling of your&s;elves with them on this day, as the manner of &s;ome, I might &s;ay, of many is.

People may have either rea&s;onable and good, or fooli&s;h and wicked de|&s;igns in coming to the public wor&s;hip; and may, accordingly, be either well or ill-employed while they are at it. If they come with an intention to do honor to God, to pray to and prai&s;e him, to be in&s;tructed in the knowledge of his holy will and the way of life, with a &s;incere de&s;ire to walk therein; and if they accordingly give their attention to the&s;e things while they are in the hou&s;e of God, there is no doubt but their in|tention is good and laudable; and thus far they are &s;ober-minded. But what if it &s;hould be pride or vanity, that brings them to the place of wor&s;hip;&mdash;that they may &s;hew an agreeable per|&s;on and air, or a fa&s;hionable &s;uit of cloaths? What if it &s;hould be, the "lu&s;t of uncleanne&s;s;"&mdash;that they may indulge the rovings of loo&s;e de&s;ire in a promi&s;cuous a&s;&s;embly? What if it
<PB N="137" REF="009440_0152_0F7490337191A2E0">
&s;hould be, right down impiety;&mdash;that they may divert them&s;elves with the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of others, and &s;ecretly make a mock at the &s;acred word of God, read or preached? Would per&s;ons be the more &s;ober-minded, for coming to the place of wor&s;hip with &s;uch views as the&s;e! They are all of them &s;uppo&s;eable. In the fir&s;t-mentioned ca&s;e, it is plain, they come not to wor&s;hip God, but to be wor&s;hipped them&s;elves. In the &s;econd, they come not to pay a pure and &s;piritual homage to the holy One of I&s;rael, but an impure and carnal one to <HI>Venus</HI> and her train. In the third, it is manife&s;tly, not to &s;erve God, but the devil by di&s;honouring Him. And what wor&s;e things than the&s;e, could a young man do at an ale-hou&s;e or an opera! He might po&s;&s;ibly be much more innocently employed at either of them, even on the Lord's day.</P>
<P>Now, the be&s;t interpreter of your views in coming to the public wor&s;hip, will be your ex|ternal behaviour thereat; I mean the be&s;t inter|preter hereof to men: For God is greater than your hearts, and knoweth all things, even your "thoughts afar off." If you &s;hould come into the hou&s;e of God with a light and carele&s;s, or a vain and o&s;tentatious air: If you &s;hould often come very un&s;ea&s;onably, when great part of the public wor&s;hip is over; and, by your indecent noi&s;e and blu&s;tering, as if you aimed to have the eyes of the a&s;&s;embly turned upon you, interrupt the devotion of others: If you &s;hould make it your practice to &s;tare idly or la&s;civiou&s;ly about you, to laugh, or the like: If you &s;hould do thus,
<PB N="138" REF="009440_0153_0F74903431D27C70">
I &s;ay, in&s;tead of coming &s;ea&s;onably, and in a de|cent manner; in&s;tead of behaving with gravity, joining with apparent devotion in prayer and prai&s;e to God, and giving a becoming attention to his word read or preached; what evidence would this be of your &s;obriety? Would it not rather be a proof of the vanity, levity and impiety of your hearts, than of a &s;ober-mind?&mdash;an evi|dence, that you had no &s;en&s;e of religion, and of the important ends of public wor&s;hip? So far would &s;uch a behaviour, in coming to, and while at the public wor&s;hip, be from a proof of your &s;obriety, that it would be a clear evidence of the contrary. And, in this ca&s;e, you might ju&s;tly apply to your&s;elves with &s;hame, tho&s;e words in the Proverbs of Solomon&mdash;<Q>I was almo&s;t in all evil in the mid&s;t of the congregation and a&s;|&s;embly.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. V. 14.</NOTE> Which words the wi&s;e man intro|duces, as part of the &s;uppo&s;ed confe&s;&s;ion of a fooli&s;h young One, in the deepe&s;t angui&s;h of &s;oul;&mdash;One, who had <Q>hated in&s;truction, and his heart di&s;pi&s;ed reproof; who had not obey|ed the voice of his teachers, nor inclined his ear to them that in&s;tructed him:</Q> As in the ver&s;es immediately preceeding.</P>
<P>LET me therefore, my young brethren, warn you again&s;t &s;uch an un&s;eemly, &s;uch a criminal behaviour at the public wor&s;hip; le&s;t your com|ing there, when con&s;idered in all its circum&s;tances, in&s;tead of being the lea&s;t evidence of the &s;obriety, &s;hould be a full and inconte&s;table one of the va|nity, great depravity and impiety of your minds. If you a&s;pire to the character of being &s;ober-minded,
<PB N="139" REF="009440_0154_0F749034F2013948">
you are to attend the public wor&s;hip con&s;tantly, unle&s;s nece&s;&s;arily detained from it; to come to, and behave your&s;elves at it, with a decent gravity. And, let me add, that you are to ob&s;erve the like decorum in going from it, in|&s;tead of leaving the hou&s;e of God with laughter and merriment, as if you were going from a comedy, or a loo&s;e play, in&s;tead of a prayer, a &s;ermon, and the wor&s;hip of your Creator. This I the rather mention, becau&s;e it is notorious that &s;ome young men in the town, tho' I do not &s;ay, of this Society, often go from the public wor&s;hip in &s;uch a rude, and almo&s;t riotous manner, as is quite &s;hocking, not only to people of real &s;obrie|ty, but to all that have any &s;en&s;e of decorum. And how mu&s;t that behaviour appear in the eyes of the holy God, which is &s;o ju&s;tly offen&s;ive, not only to them that truly fear him, but to all per&s;ons that have the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of decency, or propriety of behaviour?&mdash;that which would hardly be con&s;i&s;tent with decency, in the open &s;treets, at any other time!</P>
<P>IV. I MAY here naturally take occa&s;ion to caution you again&s;t <HI>exce&s;&s;ive, extravagant</HI> and <HI>riotous mirth</HI> in general. For it is certain that there is &s;uch a thing as <HI>this,</HI> which both pro|ceeds from, and tends to evil; and is cen&s;ured as criminal in the word of God. Chri&s;tian &s;obriety &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to all &s;uch fooli&s;h and outrageous mirth. Not that chearfulne&s;s and laughing are, in all ca&s;es, incon&s;i&s;tent with true &s;obriety; far from it. Solomon ob&s;erves that there is "a time to laugh," as well as "a
<PB N="140" REF="009440_0155_0F749035B81043B0">
time to weep;" which he would not certainly have &s;aid, if laughing and chearfulne&s;s had been criminal. For there is no "time for" <HI>lying,</HI> for <HI>profane</HI> &s;wearing, or for any thing that is immoral in its nature. It is far from being a duty for any, and particularly for young men, to appear always with a grave face, a gloomy, &s;orrowful or dejected countenance. I have a very contemptuous opinion of this face-religion; tho' it &s;eems to be almo&s;t the only religion of &s;ome people. We know how much of it the Scribes and Phari&s;ees had of old; and our Saviour &s;peaks of it as one in&s;tance of their hypocri&s;y, that they "disfigured their faces;" or affected to make a grave and devout appearance, while their hearts were full of pride, covetou&s;ne&s;s and ma|lice. The Je&s;uits, and other religious orders of the church of Rome at this day, are al&s;o a|bundantly &s;tock'd with this &s;ort of religion: And yet we have no rea&s;on to entertain a very high opinion of their piety, or the &s;anctity of their manners. And, in whom&s;oever an uni|form gravity of countenance is affected, it is a much &s;urer mark of cunning, knavi&s;h de&s;igns, and impo&s;ture, or at be&s;t of folly, than it is of religion or wi&s;dom. It is doing violence to na|ture, without any good end: For man has been defined "a ri&s;ible animal," with as much ju&s;tice and preci&s;ion, perhaps, as "a rea&s;onable one." And I cannot but think it very comely and agree|able, as it is far mo&s;t natural for people, e&s;pecial|ly the young, to be gay and chearful; provided only, that it is not at un&s;ea&s;onable times, or be|yond
<PB N="141" REF="009440_0156_0F749037A6FDFAB8">
the bounds of a decent moderation. Yea, it an&s;wers very valuable ends with relation to bodily health, and in divers other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>BUT yet, my young brethren, as was &s;aid be|fore, there is certainly &s;uch a thing as un&s;ea&s;on|able, extravagant and &s;inful mirth. For you cannot &s;uppo&s;e that the wi&s;e man had no mean|ing, when he cen&s;ured him&s;elf for indulging to mirth in the following words: <Q>I &s;aid in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy plea&s;ure: And behold, this al|&s;o is vanity. I &s;aid of laughter it is mad, and of mirth, what doeth it?<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccles. II. 1, 1.</NOTE> And again:&mdash;"The heart of fools is in the hou&s;e of mirth. It is better to hear the rebuke of the wi&s;e man, than for a man to hear the &s;ong of fools. For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, &s;o is the laughter of the fool: this al&s;o is vanity.</Q><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ch. VII. 4, 5, 6.</NOTE> In conformity hereto, a Greater and Wi&s;er than Solomon has &s;aid, <Q>Wo unto you that laugh now; for ye &s;hall weep and lament.</Q><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Luke VI. 25.</NOTE> It would doubtle&s;s be trifling, to pre&s;cribe particular times and limits, or to give <HI>formal rules</HI> for mirth and laughter; and, in a &s;ermon, this might, perhaps, provoke them both very un&s;ea&s;onably. It is, however, certain in general, that this natural, comely and u&s;eful pa&s;&s;ion, ought to be under the re&s;traint of rea&s;on, as well as the other pa&s;&s;ions; and, that &s;obriety of mind implies &s;uch re&s;traint. I know of no better general di|rection relative to this matter, than this;&mdash;to remember that you are <Q>rea&s;onable, as well as ri&s;ible creatures;</Q> and to have an habitual &s;en&s;e
<PB N="142" REF="009440_0157_0F7490388A600950">
of God's pre&s;ence with you at all times, and of moral, religious obligations. This may be a &s;ufficient, and perhaps the be&s;t guide and &s;ecurity, again&s;t all unbecoming levity of mind, all un&s;ea|&s;onable and exce&s;&s;ive mirth.</P>
<P>LET me, however, ju&s;t remind you of one negative rule relating to this matter, which is implied in the general one above. And that is, that you are never to indulge your own mirth, or to provoke that of others, by &s;inging pro|fane, loo&s;e, immoral or ob&s;cene &s;ongs; nor even willingly hear them. For even "the re|buke of the wi&s;e, is better than the &s;ong of fools." And, <Q>Is any merry, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, let him &s;ing p&s;alms.</Q> It would, indeed, be a piece of weakne&s;s and &s;uper&s;tition to &s;uppo&s;e, that this which St. James recommends, is the <HI>only</HI> way in which mirth and joy can be inno|cently indulged. But yet it gives me a fair opportunity to recommend to you the learning of p&s;almody, that agreeable and u&s;eful art: Which might not only be the means of our carrying on this part of public wor&s;hip in the mo&s;t decent and edifying manner; but prove a delightful entertainment to you in private, and a means to prevent your &s;pending &s;ome of your hours in &s;uch mirth, as can hardly be accounted innocent&mdash;The tran&s;ition from hence to diver|&s;ions and amu&s;ements, of which the young of both &s;exes are &s;o fond, will not be unnatural. Wherefore,</P>
<P>V. IF you would de&s;erve the character of be|ing &s;ober-minded, you are to refrain from all <HI>&s;in|ful
<PB N="143" REF="009440_0158_0F749039337F1B00">
diver&s;ions,</HI> or <HI>recreations.</HI> For chri&s;tian &s;o|briety doubtle&s;s &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to every thing that <HI>properly</HI> falls under this head.</P>
<P>BUT, le&s;t you &s;hould think me unrea&s;onably au&s;tere, I will plainly own to you, what is indeed implied in the manner of expre&s;&s;ion ju&s;t now u&s;ed,&mdash;"&s;inful diver&s;ions,"&mdash;that every thing is <HI>not</HI> &s;inful, which goes under the name of <HI>diver&s;ions.</HI> Neither rea&s;on, nor the law of God, ab&s;olutely forbids every thing of this &s;ort. Nay, I will go further: The pre&s;ent frail, and imperfect condi|tion of human nature, which will not, cannot &s;ubmit to an uninterrupted application to labor, or to grave, &s;erious and weighty matters, &s;eems to require &s;ome relief, &s;ome relaxations of this kind. And certainly, if they are lawful or in|nocent in any per&s;ons, they are &s;o in the young, who need them mo&s;t. I am therefore far from thinking, a young man ought to be &s;uperciliou&s;ly condemned for being &s;ometimes at a concert of mu&s;ic, or a dance. It may be added, that per&s;ons of a &s;tudious, reclu&s;e, or any &s;edentary way of life, almo&s;t univer&s;ally need, once in a while, to take &s;ome &s;ort of bodily exerci&s;e, not merely as a relaxation to the mind, but for health. For, in this &s;en&s;e, "bodily exerci&s;e profiteth" much, how little &s;oever it may profit in any other. If people can, at the &s;ame time, promote this valua|ble end, and innocently amu&s;e, relax and un|bend their minds, &s;o as to return with new &s;pi|rits and vigor to their &s;tated bu&s;ine&s;s, there is nei|ther law, go&s;pel nor rea&s;on again&s;t it. And it is a maxim, that tho&s;e exerci&s;es of the body, with
<PB N="144" REF="009440_0159_0F74903975D43A48">
which the mind is in &s;ome mea&s;ure gratified, u&s;ually contribute mo&s;t to the recovery and pre|&s;ervation of health. In which view, riding, danc|ing, hunting, fi&s;hing, and divers other manly ex|erci&s;es, according to peoples different ta&s;tes, have been often recommended by the able&s;t phy&s;icians, and found &s;alutary by the experience of many per&s;ons.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The author hopes that the conce&s;&s;ions which he has made above, relative to diver&s;ions, will not be offen&s;ive to any &s;eri|ous and judicious chri&s;tian, who duly con&s;iders the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human nature; e&s;pecially after reading the re&s;tric|tions in the following paragraphs. If One were to a&s;k, Whether it was criminal for boys of 6, 8 or 10 years old, to whip a <HI>top,</HI> to play <HI>marbles,</HI> or the like? Whether it would an&s;wer any valuable ends to keep them wholly from the&s;e pa&s;times, and oblige them to apply them&s;elves con|&s;tantly to their books? Or whether it is &s;uppo&s;eable, that prophets and apo&s;tles &s;hould be commi&s;&s;ioned to prohibit the&s;e &s;ports of children?&mdash;Every one would, probably, an&s;wer in the negative; and confe&s;s that this would be the readie&s;t way to make children dunces in&s;tead of &s;cholars, by giving them a di&s;ta&s;te to their learning, and breaking their &s;pirits, if it did not ruin their health al&s;o. The ca&s;e is, in a degree, the &s;ame, not only with young men and women, but even with tho&s;e who are more advanced in years, unle&s;s they are of a very &s;aturnine, heavy, melancholly or &s;uper&s;titious make. Even the Old, generally need &s;ome kind of relaxations. But, to keep the young wholly from diver&s;ions under religious pretences, is quite irrational; and the direct cour&s;e to make them <HI>irreligious,</HI> by giving them a di&s;ta&s;te to all religion, as a &s;our, gloomy and moro&s;e thing. And &s;ome well-meaning men have probably much di&s;&s;erved the intere&s;t of religion, by their too great rigor and &s;everity in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>IT may be farther ob&s;erved as to <HI>dancing</HI> in particular, (tho' the author him&s;elf had never any ta&s;te for it) That the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t heathen morali&s;ts recommended it, not only as an healthy, but a kind of &s;acred and religious exerci&s;e. But it is countenanced by a far greater authority than theirs;&mdash;that of the holy &s;criptures. The royal p&s;almi&s;t calls upon the children of Zion to prai&s;e the Lord's "name in the dance&mdash;with the timbrel and harp." [Ps. cxlix. 2, 3. and cl. 4.] And Solomon &s;ays, There is "a time to dance." [Eccles. iii. 4.] How then did Chri&s;tians come to have a more gloomy, au&s;tere religion than Jews! Did they learn it from Chri&s;t's being at "Cana of Galilee?"&mdash;or from his in&s;pired apo&s;tles? Neither. And the zeal of &s;ome Chri&s;tians again&s;t dancing in general, is the more remarkable, be|cau&s;e this is one of the joyous images, under which the Spirit of prophecy has repre&s;ented the glory and happine&s;s of the MESSIAH's kingdom; and this even <HI>mixt dancing.</HI> [Jer. xxxi. 13.] <Q>Then &s;hall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together. For I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their &s;orrow.</Q> [See Luke xv. 25.]&mdash;How much wi&s;er are &s;ome of our modern &s;ages and re|formers, than either DAVID or SOLOMON, or&mdash;! Super|&s;tition, tho' appearing under the larve and di&s;gui&s;e of religion, is in fact one of its wor&s;t enemies, by making it appear four and unamiable. And we very frequently &s;ee, both how much occa&s;ion there was for certain admonitions, and how little &s;ome regard them&mdash;"Be not righteous over much"&mdash;[Eccl. viii. 16.]&mdash;"Every word of God is pure&mdash;Add thou not unto his words, le&s;t he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar."

by to prepare him for a renewed application to bu&s;ine&s;s. It is therefore a great abu&s;e there|of, when they di&s;qualify for bu&s;ine&s;s, in&s;tead of being a preparation for it.</P>
<P>LET me add another caution. You &s;hould not &s;uffer the <HI>love</HI> of any diver&s;ions to <HI>reign,</HI> to be <HI>predominant</HI> in your hearts; or to en|gro&s;s your thoughts and affections, to the exclu&s;ion of tho&s;e things that are truly noble and important in their nature. To have the heart and affections &s;trongly attached to a|mu&s;ements or diver&s;ions, &s;o as to think chief|ly of them, and to be impatient for their re|turn, is a mark of great levity, and a frivo|lous turn of mind, even tho' One &s;hould not tran&s;gre&s;s any of the foregoing rules by rea&s;on hereof; which yet is hardly a &s;uppo&s;eable ca&s;e. Nor is this merely a weakne&s;s, but a &s;in: For it implies an ab&s;ence of the grand con|cerns of life and godline&s;s from the thoughts; and &s;hews the heart to be immoderately &s;et upon mere trifles. If you ought to take heed, as certainly you ought, that your affections are not immoderately &s;et even upon the law|ful bu&s;ine&s;s, gains and occupations of this life, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e things that are a|bove, the high concerns of religion and eter|nity; much more ought you to take heed, that they are not thus &s;et upon mere diver&s;i|ons and pa&s;times; the occa&s;ion for which, you are to remember, ari&s;es from the <HI>imper|fection</HI> of human nature, &s;ometimes calling for
<PB N="150" REF="009440_0165_0F74903F423A5BB8">
them as a little relaxation from grave and momentous affairs. Nor &s;hould you forget, even in your recreations, that you are in the pre&s;ence of the omni&s;cient and holy God. Neither &s;hould you allow your&s;elves in any kinds or degrees of them, which render the thought of <HI>&s;uch a pre&s;ence</HI> unea&s;y and terrify|ing to you: For, to you at lea&s;t, tho&s;e which do &s;o, are &s;inful. That which you cannot do, con&s;idering your&s;elves as in God's pre|&s;ence, without fearing his di&s;plea&s;ure for it, is certainly criminal in you, whatever it might be in other per&s;ons.</P>
<P>IF you would be &s;ober-minded, my young brethren, you are to ob&s;erve the&s;e, or the like re&s;trictions and regulations re&s;pecting your diver&s;ions: And I &s;hould have particularly &s;ubjoined one more, relative to them, had it not fallen naturally under, what &s;eems to be of con&s;equence enough to make a di&s;tinct head of di&s;cour&s;e, as follows; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>VI. PRIDE, and <HI>extravagant expence</HI> in <HI>ap|parel,</HI> or the external adorning of your per|&s;ons. This is an heinous &s;in, very frequent|ly, and mo&s;t &s;olemnly cen&s;ured in the word of God. It is a &s;in again&s;t which, not only young women, but young men, are to be par|ticularly warned, as incon&s;i&s;tent with chri&s;|tian &s;obriety&mdash;It were well if &s;ome even of the aged of both &s;exes, did not need the like caution&mdash;It is, indeed, far from being a vir|tue in any, particularly in young men, to ap|pear in rags, in an uncleanly or &s;lovenly dre&s;s,
<PB N="151" REF="009440_0166_0F74903F765BF078">
if it is in their power to appear otherwi&s;e, in clean and becoming apparel, e&s;pecially in public. And if this is not in their power, it is a nece&s;&s;ity to be pitied, not a virtue to be commended. It may be added, that not on|ly the cu&s;tom of all civilized nations in all a|ges, but the holy &s;criptures them&s;elves, war|rant &s;ome di&s;tinction of dre&s;s in per&s;ons, an|&s;werable to the difference in their &s;tations and circum&s;tances in life. There &s;eems to be a propriety in this; and &s;ome valuable ends are doubtle&s;s an&s;wered hereby, con&s;idering the &s;tate and temper of mankind, and our con|nexions in civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BUT it is the great unhappine&s;s and &s;in of many young people, that their hearts are &s;et on gay and co&s;tly apparel, as if this were a matter of mighty con&s;equence. And many of them, in&s;tead of being content with &s;uch cloathing as is &s;uitable to their degree and cir|cum&s;tances, to their own or their parents worldly e&s;tate, a&s;pire after what is far beyond either; often to the great prejudice of their too indulgent parents, and to their own real intere&s;t: I might add, to the hurt of their cre|dit al&s;o. For their reputation &s;uffers hereby in the opinion of all wi&s;e and di&s;crete per&s;ons, who are acquainted with them and their cir|cum&s;tances. And yet, when they have thus expo&s;ed them&s;elves by the gaiety and co&s;tline&s;s of their cloathing, wholly di&s;pro|portionate to their rank and circum&s;tances; they are often &s;till farther unhappy, and the
<PB N="152" REF="009440_0167_0F7490403314A900">
more worthy of deri&s;ion, by being proud of it; making a &s;ort of merit of their folly and vanity; and treating with contempt, their equals, perhaps their &s;uperiours, who&s;e ap|parel is more mode&s;t and decent. By this means tho&s;e good ends which might other|wi&s;e be an&s;wered in &s;ociety, by the di&s;tincti|ons of dre&s;s, are in a great mea&s;ure defeated; for this confounds all ranks, de&s;troys due &s;ub|ordination, and even inverts the natural or|der of things, by &s;etting poor people of low degree above the rich, and tho&s;e that are of high; i. e. &s;o far as mere pride, and &s;umptu|ous cloathing, can do it. And be&s;ides; how many people have, chiefly by this very means, been reduced to want and beggary?&mdash;a ve|ry congruous puni&s;hment, which the wi&s;e Author of nature and of order has ordained for tho&s;e, who &s;o vainly and wickedly attempt to confound and invert them! All who know any thing of the world, and particularly of this town and country, know that this is a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of facts; not at all heightened or exaggerated. I do not mean, that all young men are ju&s;tly chargeable with this &s;in and folly, but that it is a very common one a|mong&s;t us. And all who know any thing of the holy &s;criptures, know that extravagant expence, and pride in the article of dre&s;s, are often forbidden, and &s;everely condemned in tho&s;e &s;acred oracles. Yea, the light of nature, or common &s;en&s;e, ea&s;ily di&s;cerns the&s;e to be egregious follies and vices.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="009440_0168_0F749040F49A1468">
I MUST therefore warn you again&s;t the&s;e things, my young brethren, as quite incon|&s;i&s;tent with gravity and chri&s;tian &s;obriety. They are not to be countenanced even in the <HI>other &s;ex;</HI> for the peculiar ca&s;t of who&s;e minds, &s;ome may po&s;&s;ibly think, a little allowance &s;hould be made: Much le&s;s ought they to be countenanced in <HI>ours,</HI> who&s;e thoughts and cares ought, certainly, to be employed about matters of far greater importance, than the beauty or richne&s;s of our apparel, and ma|king a gay external appearance, to catch the eyes of idle, empty &s;tarers; and to di&s;gu&s;t tho&s;e of the knowing ob&s;erver. In a word, &s;obri|ety and foppery are incompatible with each other.</P>
<P>ALL the young would do well to remem|ber the fatal <HI>garden</HI> and the <HI>fig-leaves;</HI> the &s;ad occa&s;ion, upon which the u&s;e of cloathing was fir&s;t introduced into this apo&s;tate world. Innocence would have wanted no covering for &s;hame and di&s;honor. If you con&s;ider this, you will not pride your&s;elves in any kind of apparel, however gay or &s;umptuous, unle&s;s you are of &s;uch a frivolous and depraved turn of mind, as to glory in your &s;hame. For your cloathing, as it is the con&s;equence, is al&s;o a natural memento, of your fir&s;t parents fall, guilt and di&s;honor; and, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, of your own al&s;o.</P>
<P>IF you are in any degree &s;ober-minded, there is another kind of cloathing which will &s;o far engro&s;s your thoughts and cares, as to
<PB N="154" REF="009440_0169_0F749041C686E218">
leave but little room for any about the quality of your external dre&s;s. I mean that, of which Job &s;ays, <Q>I put on righteou&s;ne&s;s, and it cloathed me: My judgment was as a robe and a diadem.</Q> The &s;ame, of which our Saviour &s;peaks under the name of "a wedding garment"; for the want of which, &s;o many per&s;ons, and &s;ome of tho&s;e of the highe&s;t rank, even tho&s;e that are in kings courts, and of royal dignity, will hereafter be excluded from "the marriage &s;upper of the Lamb," tho' at pre&s;ent "cloathed in &s;oft raiment"&mdash;That which our Saviour again &s;peaks of, in his me&s;&s;age from heaven to the church of Laodi|cea, &s;aying&mdash;<Q>Thou &s;aye&s;t, I am rich, and increa&s;ed in goods, and have need of no|thing; and knowe&s;t not that thou art wretched, and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind, and <HI>naked.</HI> I coun&s;el thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire&mdash;and white rai|ment, that the &s;hame of thy nakedne&s;s do not appear</Q>&mdash;That with which the &s;pou&s;e of Chri&s;t, his true church, is adorned: Of whom it is &s;aid, that <Q>to her was granted that &s;he &s;hould be arayed in fine linen, clean and white; for the fine linen is the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;aints&mdash;And, Ble&s;&s;ed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, le&s;t he walk naked, and men &s;ee his &s;hame</Q>!</P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e metaphors and &s;imilitudes the &s;acred writers, and our Lord him&s;elf, re|pre&s;ents that faith and &s;ub&s;tantial piety, that virtue, holine&s;s and good works, which the
<PB N="155" REF="009440_0170_0F74904328327760">
go&s;pel enjoins upon its profe&s;&s;ors; and all which are comprehended in being &s;ober-min|ded. To be cloathed with the&s;e, to be adorn|ed with this righteou&s;ne&s;s, is to have the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, <Q>the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God by faith.</Q> This is a garment which, un|changed, will &s;erve for all &s;ea&s;ons of the year, and for every climate. It will neither be worn out nor impaired in beauty, by u&s;e and time; but become the firmer, the more &s;plendid and beautiful. It will endure all weathers, winds, rains and &s;torms, without fading; even eternity will but increa&s;e its lu&s;tre. And though, perhaps, it may not en|title you to what is called <HI>good company,</HI>&mdash;the company of the great-little, rich-poor men of this world; yet you need not e&s;teem it the le&s;s on that account: For it will be the means of your gaining admi&s;&s;ion hereafter in|to the kingdom of heaven; into the fellow|&s;hip of ju&s;t men made perfect; of the noble army of martyrs; of the innumerable compa|ny of angels; of Je&s;us the mediator of the new-covenant, and of God the judge of all; who&s;e <Q>face you &s;hall behold in righteou&s;|ne&s;s</Q>! To de&s;ire to be cloathed with &s;uch a robe as this, and to wear &s;uch a diadem, is a truly great and rea&s;onable ambition. And when you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, yea, whenever you &s;incerely de&s;ire it, one of your lea&s;t con|cerns will be, "what you &s;hall put on," or "wherewithal you &s;hall be cloathed," in any other re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="009440_0171_0F7490439DD8C328">
VII. ANOTHER &s;in, again&s;t which you are to be particularly warned, is <HI>idlene&s;s,</HI> the neglect of <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> or <HI>mis-&s;pence</HI> of <HI>time;</HI> all which come nearly to the &s;ame thing. Time is indeed precious, if eternity it&s;elf is of any importance! It ought to be &s;pent in &s;uch a manner, as will turn to good account; that is, in a rea&s;onable, pious and virtuous manner; And none of it ought to be &s;pent otherwi&s;e, or thrown away. I do not mean, that peo|ple are obliged to be always either at their de|votions, or their labors, the <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of life. Some time is requi&s;ite for taking food, for re&s;t, &s;leep, conver&s;ation, and even for recreation and amu&s;ement, con&s;idering the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate of human nature; as has before been ob&s;erved. And the time &s;o &s;pent, under pro|per re&s;trictions, is far from being thrown a|way or lo&s;t: It is &s;pent according to nature, rea&s;on and religion. But the article of &s;leep being excepted, which alone requires more than a quarter part of our time in general, a &s;mall proportion of it may well &s;uffice for all the others together, for people that are in health; except, perhaps, for children. And whatever time is &s;pent in any of the&s;e ways, beyond a rea&s;onable, due proportion, be that what it will, is at the be&s;t thrown away and lo&s;t; perhaps much wor&s;e. It is morally im|po&s;&s;ible for any per&s;on to neglect the proper duties of life, or to live long in idlene&s;s, with|out falling into &s;uch practices as are po&s;itively criminal: For the idle per&s;on is not only pe|culiarly
<PB N="157" REF="009440_0172_0F749043FAC067C0">
expo&s;ed to the &s;nares and &s;eductions of the "wicked One;" but does, as it were, tempt the devil to tempt <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>AND con&s;idering at once, what real calls there are for labor on one hand, the general aver&s;ion to it on the other, and the pernicious con&s;equences of idlene&s;s, both with re&s;pect to civil life and religion: Con&s;idering the&s;e things, I &s;ay, it is not without the highe&s;t rea&s;on, that the holy &s;criptures abound with &s;trict prohibitions of idlene&s;s, and many po&s;itive in|junctions of diligence. The fatal con&s;equen|ces of &s;loth, both with regard to the pre&s;ent and future life, are al&s;o repre&s;ented in the &s;tronge&s;t colors, in the &s;acred oracles. Yea, the experience of all ages, has afforded &s;en&s;i|ble demon&s;tration of the ill effects of this vice. A lazy, &s;lothful cour&s;e of life, is not only ab|&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with chri&s;tian &s;obriety, as being it&s;elf &s;inful in an high degree; but it naturally, and almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily leads to ma|ny other vices, as was intimated before. There are very few per&s;ons, if any, that can live a con&s;iderable time together in a &s;tate of <HI>inac|tivity,</HI> as &s;erpents, bears, and &s;ome other ani|mals are &s;aid to do in their holes and dens, for many months of the year in cold climates. A man, particularly a young man in the &s;pring, the warmth and highe&s;t vigor of life, will or|dinarily be <HI>doing &s;omething,</HI> either innocent and good, or bad and criminal, except when he is a&s;leep. And he that neither &s;erves God, nor his generation according to the will of
<PB N="158" REF="009440_0173_0F749044B2F58840">
God, in &s;ome hone&s;t and laudable way, will of cour&s;e &s;erve the devil and his lu&s;ts, and be much le&s;s a ble&s;&s;ing than a cur&s;e to the world, and to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>HOW many young men have &s;ome of us known, the &s;ad examples of this truth!&mdash;young men who&s;e ruin, to all human ap|pearance, both as to this world and the next, took its ri&s;e from idlene&s;s, and the di&s;u&s;e of a|ny lawful calling: Sometimes thro' the cri|minal and cruel neglect of their parents to put them in any way of bu&s;ine&s;s, and to ex|cite them to diligence therein; and often thro' their own native love of idlene&s;s and plea&s;ures, and their aver&s;ion to any kind of &s;teady appli|cation to bu&s;ine&s;s. Would to God, I could my&s;elf call to mind to very &s;triking and me|lancholy in&s;tances of this &s;ort! And if you, my young brethren, know of any &s;uch, it will be your wi&s;dom to take warning by them.</P>
<P>BUT when an idle life is &s;poken of as re|pugnant to a &s;ober one, and indu&s;try as an important branch of that &s;obriety which young men ought to practi&s;e; it is not meant hereby, that they are all obliged to what is com|monly called hard labor; or to employ them|&s;elves in mechanical arts or hu&s;bandry, in merchandize or navigation. No: There are many ingenuous, laudable arts and employ|ments, tending to the ornament and u&s;e of human life, which come under neither of the&s;e heads. A ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary war, al&s;o furni&s;hes employment for many; and it is
<PB N="159" REF="009440_0174_0F7490466BECFEC0">
truly an honourable employment to fight for the defence of One's King and country, for laws and liberty, whether in the field or up|on the mighty waters. There are al&s;o many civil offices, in the exerci&s;e of, or at lea&s;t in the preparation for which, young men may be worthily engaged. There are al&s;o tho&s;e three, which are commonly called the learned pro|fe&s;&s;ions,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Law, Phy&s;ic and Divinity.</NOTE> in the exerci&s;e of which, or in ac|quiring the needful qualifications for them, young men may be laudably employed<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">N. B. All under 25 or 26 years are con&s;idered as "young men," in the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es.</NOTE>. Any of the&s;e referred to, are lawful employments; and all that are &s;o, tho' not equally honoura|ble, may yet be accounted &s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure; and, of con&s;equence, tho&s;e per&s;ons who faith|fully and worthily di&s;charge them, are worthy of honor in their re&s;pective &s;tations; in con|formity to the apo&s;tolic injunction, "HONOR ALL MEN."</P>
<P>BESIDES: There are &s;ome per&s;ons, whom God has ble&s;&s;ed at once with riches, and with large, &s;agacious and contemplative minds, who may both very worthily as to them&s;elves, and u&s;efully to the world, devote the greater part of their time to &s;tudy, to making ob&s;er|vations on, and di&s;coveries in, the word and works of God, and communicating their di&s;|coveries to mankind; in&s;tead of applying them&s;elves to any other bu&s;ine&s;s. To &s;uch men as the&s;e, the world has been, and is, greatly indebted; and the glory of God, at
<PB N="160" REF="009440_0175_0F749047118BA748">
the &s;ame time, is eminently promoted by them. What more honourable or u&s;eful em|ployment can there well be, than this?</P>
<P>NOW, all that is intended, when the great &s;in of idlene&s;s, and the nece&s;&s;ity of a virtuous diligence are in&s;i&s;ted on, is, that young men are indi&s;pen&s;ably bound to be diligent in &s;ome one or more of the&s;e hone&s;t and lau|dable ways; having &s;omething habitually in view, which they con&s;ider, and to which they give their attention, as a <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s;</HI> and in which they accordingly employ the greater part of their time. Without this, I think, no young man can well de&s;erve the character of being &s;ober-minded: Since, if he lives an idle life, in oppo&s;ition hereto, he is in &s;uch a cour&s;e of life as is unrea&s;onable in it&s;elf; &s;uch an one as the holy &s;criptures have mo&s;t ex|pre&s;sly and repeatedly forbidden; &s;uch an one as expo&s;es him to many great and pecu|liar temptations; &s;uch an one as it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to continue long in, without falling into &s;ome of tho&s;e practices, which are &s;till more apparently immoral and wicked; &s;uch an one as will probably be pernicious to tho&s;e a|bout him, ruinous to him&s;elf in this world, and terminate in his de&s;truction in the other.</P>
<P>IN a word then, my young brethren, take heed how you employ your TIME. It is at once fleeting, precarious, precious; and even of infinite importance to you, if that ETER|NITY is &s;o, which depends upon the u&s;e you make of it!</P>

<P>IN the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e I mentioned to you &s;everal &s;ins and exce&s;&s;es, again&s;t which young men need to be particularly warned, as in|con&s;i&s;tent with that &s;obriety to which they are to be exhorted. In doing this it was my de&s;ign, not merely to &s;hew you what you ought to avoid, as contrary to chri&s;tian &s;obriety; but al&s;o po&s;itively, what manner of life you ought to lead, as agree|able

thereto: And, at the &s;ame time, in a cur&s;ory manner, to di&s;&s;wade you from the one, and ex|cite you to the other. There are many more vices, follies and criminal exce&s;&s;es, my beloved young brethren, again&s;t which you may need to be cautioned; con&s;idering the depravity of your hearts, and the many &s;nares and temptations of this evil world. I &s;hall accordingly, by God's leave and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, proceed to &s;peak of &s;ome others of them in this di&s;cour&s;e, with the &s;ame view;&mdash;not to accu&s;e, but to warn and advi&s;e you. And may He, from whom all light, and true wi&s;dom are derived, cau&s;e you to profit by the&s;e friendly in&s;tructions!&mdash;The next &s;in, again&s;t which I would particularly caution you, is,</P>
<P>VIII. A DISRESPECTFUL or <HI>contemptuous behaviour</HI> towards your <HI>&s;uperiors,</HI> whether in age or in office. Refu&s;ing, or even neglecting to give honor to the&s;e, to whom it belongs, is an heinous offence again&s;t the laws of God, and again&s;t &s;ociety, as well as again&s;t the particular per&s;ons, to whom the di&s;re&s;pect is &s;hewn. And &s;uch refu&s;al, or neglect, generally, tho' not al|ways, proceeds from great pride of heart. Some|times it may be owing to mere ignorance, or in|advertence; in which ca&s;e it is much more ea&s;ily excu&s;ed by all, than when formally de&s;igned; for then it is ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the effect of envy, pride and in&s;olence. But it can hardly be accounted quite innocent, even when it proceeds from inadvertence only: Becau&s;e all the mem|bers of &s;ociety in general, ought to know and con&s;ider what is due from them to others; and

therefore the giving honor to whom honor is due, and fear to whom fear, is the &s;ubject of a chri&s;tian precept.</P>
<P>SOME per&s;ons have, indeed, made a &s;trange pretence of religion and con&s;cience for declining the u&s;e of mo&s;t of tho&s;e external ge&s;tures, motions, &amp;c. which cu&s;tom has e&s;tabli&s;hed as marks of re&s;pect, civility or good manners; &s;crupling to bend their bodies, to uncover their heads, or the like, even in the pre&s;ence of their king: Tho' the great patriarch Abraham, the father of the faithful, &s;tood up, and bowed him&s;elf even to the children of H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">th.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen.

The&s;e are at be&s;t groundle&s;s and &s;u|per&s;titious conceits, tho' there is doubtle&s;s a me|dium to be ob&s;erved as to things of this &s;ort; for there is hardly any thing, however innocent in its nature, in which there may not be a fooli&s;h, or even criminal exce&s;s. But in general it is, doubtle&s;s, not a &s;in but a duty, to &s;hew regard to tho&s;e to whom it is due, in all tho&s;e ways which the different cu&s;toms of nations have e&s;tabli&s;hed as external marks and &s;igns of a civil re&s;pect; provided only, that they are not in their nature evil. To refu&s;e to give tho&s;e tokens of re&s;pect, which are thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, if innocent in them|&s;elves, is actually contrary to the true &s;pirit of the apo&s;tolic precept before mentioned, concerning giving honor to tho&s;e to whom it is due. For this giving of honor, cannot be thought to refer

intirely to an inward e&s;teem or veneration, of which there are no vi&s;ible tokens or &s;igns; but mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to comprehend the cu&s;tomary external proofs and manife&s;tations of &s;uch a re|gard; only under the re&s;trictions hinted at above. And let me add, that wi&s;e and good men in for|mer ages, to &s;peak in the mo&s;t moderate terms, were never &s;o whim&s;ical and &s;uper&s;titious as to think what is now commonly called decency and good manners among&s;t men, offen&s;ive to God. It is plain that they conformed to all the inno|cent civil cu&s;toms in general, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the countries where they lived; and particularly to tho&s;e, the neglect of which might have ju&s;tly been con&s;trued into pride, &s;ourne&s;s, an undue con|tempt of, or di&s;re&s;pect to tho&s;e, with whom they had any intercour&s;e. Not to &s;hew courte&s;y to our equals, and much more, to decline giving due honor to our &s;uperiors in &s;uch ways as the&s;e, may be ju&s;tly accounted an immoral thing, a violation of God's commandments.</P>
<P>ALL other circum&s;tances being alike, age has doubtle&s;s a right to expect regard and deference from youth. This is agreeable to that order which the Author of nature has e&s;tabli&s;hed. It is al&s;o required in the word of God, that the young &s;hould honor the aged. And there is one command to this purpo&s;e, expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a manner as is worthy of a very particular attention: <Q>Thou &s;halt ri&s;e up before the <HI>hoary head,</HI> and honor the face of the <HI>old man,</HI> and <HI>fear thy God.</HI></Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Levit.

<P>IF then, you would de&s;erve the character of being &s;ober-minded, or rather, if you would ac|tually be &s;o, you are not to treat your &s;uperiors in age with contempt or neglect; but to pay all due honor to them: And e&s;pecially tho&s;e, to whom you owe honor and &s;ubjection on account of the particular relation which they bear to you, as well as on account of their years.

<P>THE apo&s;tle, &s;peaking to the young, of their duty to their parents, reminds them of that an|cient and well-known command, "Honor thy father and mother;" particularly reminding them at the &s;ame time, that this is "the fir&s;t command|ment with promi&s;e:" referring to the gracious promi&s;e implied in the words immediately fol|lowing&mdash;"that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee." It is indeed well worthy of ob&s;ervation, that this is the <HI>only</HI> commandment in the decalogue, to which any promi&s;e at all is annexed.</P>
<P>YOUNG men, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are &s;till under the immediate care and government of their pa|rents, are indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to pay them, not only an external re&s;pect and reverence, but to hearken to their coun&s;els, and to "obey them in the Lord;" i. e. in all things lawful, and agree|able to the Lord's will. And as to tho&s;e of you, my young brethren, who are not &s;till under the
<PB N="167" REF="009440_0182_0F74904D0DD11C00">
immediate eye and government of your parents, but are gone from them, and have families of your own; you will always be under a natural and religious obligation to treat them with great re&s;pect, deference and honor: And, let me add, to take care of, and to provide for them in their age, if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion for it on their part, and ability on yours. Which is certainly no more than a proper return to tho&s;e, who brought you up with &s;o much tenderne&s;s, co&s;t and care; and to whom, probably, under God, you are chiefly indebted for whatever worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and pro&s;perity you enjoy.</P>
<P>BUT you are to honor your other &s;uperiors in age and &s;tation, as well as your parents; or tho' you have none of the latter. Some of you may have guardians, who are in&s;tead of parents to you; and to whom, in divers re&s;pects, a &s;imi|lar regard is due from you. Others of you may be &s;ervants, apprentices to trade&s;men, merchants, &amp;c. And you are bound to re&s;pect and obey them in that relation. Some of you may be &s;o young, as not yet to have left the &s;chools; but to be "under tutors and governors," and in|&s;tructors in various branches of u&s;eful literature. On which &s;uppo&s;ition, you are in rea&s;on and du|ty bound to re&s;pect and honor them; to hearken to their coun&s;els, to obey them and their orders in things relative to their office: And to do other|wi&s;e will be highly di&s;plea&s;ing to God. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing here particularly, re&s;pecting your duty to religious in&s;tructors, the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, who are over you in the Lord, admoni&s;h

you, and watch for your &s;ouls as they that mu&s;t give an account: Thinking that, after what has been &s;aid relative to per&s;ons in other &s;tations, what is due to <HI>them,</HI> may be &s;afely referred to your own ingenuity, your unbia&s;&s;ed judgment and con&s;ciences. Indeed, it ever appeared to me both a vain and arrogant thing, for the mini|&s;ters of the go&s;pel to think of "magnifying their office," and gaining e&s;teem, by crying up the dignity of it; and demanding re&s;pect and homage, "as the manner of &s;ome is:" E&s;pecially if, at the &s;ame time, they rather di&s;grace their office by a behaviour unworthy of it, than honor it them|&s;elves, by a faithful di&s;charge of the important du|ties of it. And, by what I have read and ob&s;erved, I believe it very &s;eldom happens that any mini|&s;ter, who magnifies his office only by acting wor|thy of it, wants that regard which ju&s;tly belongs to him; except, perhaps, from a few particular per&s;ons: Nor has any thing contributed more to bring a reproach upon it, than the vain attempts to magnify it by other means, to the neglect of this.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t not omit particularly to remind you of the honor and obedience which you owe to your civil &s;uperiors; whether to the king as &s;upreme, or to governors as unto them that are &s;ent by him, or to others cloathed with autho|rity under either. The apo&s;tle, in this &s;ame epi&s;|tle to Titus, gives him the following direction: <Q>Put them in mind, &s;ays he, to be &s;ubject to principalities and powers, to obey magi&s;trates.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap.

officers without exception, in the due execution of tho&s;e laws; and this not for fear of "wrath," at lea&s;t not only that, "but for con&s;cience &s;ake." For they are the "mini&s;ters of God for good;" ordained by him for the "puni&s;hment of evil|doers, and for a prai&s;e to them that do well." To oppo&s;e, in&s;ult or re&s;i&s;t them, in the exerci&s;e of a lawful authority, or lightly to &s;peak evil of, and defame them, is an heinous &s;in: It is, in ef|fect, to &s;peak evil of, and oppo&s;e an ordinance of God, of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to human &s;ociety. And the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "they that re&s;i&s;t, &s;hall receive to them&s;elves damnation." Meaning hereby, that if particular per&s;ons ri&s;e up in oppo|&s;ition to the government and laws e&s;tabli&s;hed where they live, they &s;hall be condemned of God: Not that a nation or people, generally oppre&s;&s;ed and tyrannized over, by the exerci&s;e of an exor|bitant, illegal power, &s;ubver&s;ive of the funda|mental laws of a kingdom, may not ri&s;e up in defence of their laws, of the con&s;titution, of their civil liberties and rights, in oppo&s;ition to &s;uch law|le&s;s violence; as &s;ome &s;acerdotal &s;ycophants, and other tools of power have pretended, with equal folly, imprudence and impiety; that they might encourage kings to be arbitrary, unju&s;t and cruel, and reduce &s;ubjects to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t abject, mi&s;erable &s;lavery. The mo&s;t virtuous, the brave&s;t and mo&s;t enlightened &s;pirits of antiquity, of all ages, have ever a&s;&s;erted it to be right, honorable and glorious for a people, by any means to rid them&s;elves of &s;uch mon&s;ters as common tyrants; even as they would of tygers, wolves, bears and

<P>TO conclude this branch of my di&s;cour&s;e: You will, by no means, de&s;erve the character of being &s;ober-minded, if you allow your&s;elves in the violation of any of God's commandments re&s;pecting the honor, duty and &s;ubjection which you owe to your parents, the civil powers, or any of your other &s;uperiors, whether in &s;tation or years. Whatever young man di&s;obeys the&s;e important precepts of religion, he is not only de&s;titute of all chri&s;tian &s;obriety, but of all due regard to the light and dictates of nature, to which they are perfectly con&s;onant; and is &s;o far from being a loyal and worthy &s;ubject of Chri&s;t's kingdom, that he is a di&s;grace to the civil &s;ociety of which he is a member, and hardly worthy to live in it.</P>
<P>IX. LET me in the next place, my young brethren, caution you again&s;t the odious, horrid &s;in of <HI>fal&s;ehood</HI> and <HI>lying,</HI> as utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with all &s;obriety of mind. This was one of the &s;ins, for which the Cretians were particularly in|famous. The apo&s;tle, therefore, reminds Titus of their character in this re&s;pect, as given them by one of their own prophets or poets; which he confirms, and gives Titus a direction relative thereto. <Q>One of them&s;elves, even a prophet of their own &s;aid, The Cretians are always liars&mdash;This witne&s;s is true: Wherefore rebuke them &s;harply.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Titus I. 12, 13.</NOTE> And well, &s;urely, did they,

who were not only &s;ometimes guilty of this de|te&s;table &s;in, but "alway liars," de&s;erve to be <HI>&s;harply</HI> rebuked.</P>
<P>THIS vice is found in per&s;ons of all ages, and all characters, almo&s;t,&mdash;except good ones. Even &s;ome of the Old, if they are not <HI>alway</HI> liars, yet are <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> &s;o: And as they have lived with a lye in their mouths, &s;o they probably die at la&s;t with one in "their right hand." But this &s;eems to be, very particularly, one of the &s;ins of youth. There is no &s;in, which at once &s;o early and &s;o fully di&s;covers the pravity of the human heart, as lying. And this is the rea&s;on why the p&s;almi&s;t, &s;peaking of the wicked, and their early wandering from the paths of virtue, gives this, rather than any other, as an example thereof; &s;aying, &s;omewhat hyperboli|cally indeed, That they are "e&s;tranged from the womb; and go a&s;tray as &s;oon as they are born, <HI>&s;peaking lies.</HI>" Many children there are, who grow up in this evil practice; and &s;trengthen, by cu&s;tom and habit, the corrupt bia&s;s and propen|&s;ity of nature: Of whom it may be &s;aid, with particular propriety, that they are <Q>of their father the devil; for he is a liar, and the father of it;</Q> and the lu&s;t of their father they do.</P>
<P>THERE are many &s;orts of lying and of liars in the world;&mdash;<HI>political, foren&s;ic, medical, mer|cantile, martial, mechanical, eccle&s;ia&s;tical,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. A circum&s;tantial de&s;cription of any one of them, particularly of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and the <HI>la&s;t</HI> mentioned, would fill many volumes. But I mu&s;t content my&s;elf with only ob&s;erving in general, That
<PB N="172" REF="009440_0187_0F74905140724DB8">
under this head of lying, comes all wilful de|ception of others by words, to their prejudice, or to the injury of any per&s;on or per&s;ons what|&s;oever; whether in the way of defamation or flattery, of bearing witne&s;s, or of common nar|ration, of trade and commerce, of political wrangling, of juridical debate, of empirical juggling, of eccle&s;ia&s;tic impo&s;ture, of trade and commerce; whether with reference to the bu&s;i|ne&s;s and concerns of life, ordinary or extraordi|nary; whether relative to this world, or to that which is to come. Who&s;oever wilfully deceives another in either of the&s;e ways, with any view to benefit him&s;elf, or to hurt and injure any other per&s;on, is&mdash;a LIAR. Con&s;ider then, how many per&s;ons of this infamous character there are in this wicked, fal&s;e world; and how <HI>capacious</HI> a "lake" mu&s;t that be, in which it is &s;aid, "ALL liars &s;hall have their part."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. XXI. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>FALSEHOOD is a principal prop of the king|dom of darkne&s;s and of &s;atan; of iniquity, &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry, of all vice and unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s among&s;t men; the grand engine which the devil works, partly with his own &s;kilful hand, and partly by tho&s;e of his children, in order to accompli&s;h his malicious and accur&s;ed de&s;igns, to &s;ubvert all order, to confound all right and ju&s;tice, and to de&s;troy mankind. For it is by "deceiving the nations," that he ruins them, and &s;upports his kingdom. Truth, on the other hand, is the foundation of God's king|dom, con&s;i&s;ting in righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t. Chri&s;t therefore <Q>came
<PB N="173" REF="009440_0188_0F7490519CC89B48">
into the world, to bear witne&s;s to the truth.</Q> This is the grand &s;upport of religion, order, ju&s;tice and human &s;ociety; neither of which can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without truth. Lying is therefore one of the greate&s;t &s;ins; and loving and &s;peaking the truth, one of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, the mo&s;t im|portant virtues. This is a material and e&s;&s;ential branch of chri&s;tian &s;obriety. They are, accord|ingly, &s;ometimes joined together in &s;cripture, as being clo&s;ely connected: As when the apo&s;tle &s;ays, <Q>I am not mad, mo&s;t noble Fe&s;tus; but &s;peak forth the words of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>&s;oberne&s;s.</HI></Q> In which pa&s;&s;age, by the way, truth and &s;obriety &s;tand in oppo&s;ition, not merely to known, wilful fal&s;ehood; but al&s;o to enthu&s;ia&s;tic error and de|lu&s;ion, &s;uper&s;tition and religious <HI>madne&s;s.</HI> <Q>I am not <HI>mad</HI>&mdash;but,</Q> &amp;c. This is an ob&s;ervation, of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to make &s;ome farther u&s;e, before I clo&s;e the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>LYING is a &s;in, &s;o frequently and &s;olemnly forbidden in the holy &s;criptures; and the &s;peak|ing of truth is &s;o often and po&s;itively enjoined therein, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary to refer you to any particular pa&s;&s;ages to this purpo&s;e. You can have no pretence to &s;obriety, unle&s;s you ab|&s;tain from, and abhor lying, as one of the mo&s;t pernicious, execrable vices; a vice which is de|&s;tructive of the whole religious and moral charac|ter, and incon&s;i&s;tent, in its very nature, with every good and amiable quality, except in appearance only. You are then, to &s;peak truth at all times, and with all per&s;ons; to be &s;incere and open, frank and ingenuous in all your intercour&s;e

with the world: So as to avoid the very appear|ance, and much more the reality, of this &s;hame|ful and abominable &s;in of lying; the very name of which is odious, and the imputation of which is u&s;ually and ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the highe&s;t reproach, the greate&s;t affront that one per&s;on can well offer to another.</P>
<P>THOSE who have had a good, or even tolera|ble education, are almo&s;t &s;hocked at the very &s;ound of the word <HI>lye:</HI> At lea&s;t, they generally affect to be &s;o, even while, perhaps, &s;ome of them have no religion or virtue, and often com|mit the &s;in it&s;elf; disgui&s;ing, as well as they can, the horror and infamy of it under &s;ome &s;ofter name, thro' an hypocritical &s;ort of delicacy. But things &s;hould be called by their proper names. A lye does not cea&s;e to be &s;o, and be|come an innocent thing, by being covered with a good name, any more than a ravening wolf is transformed into an harmle&s;s animal, by "coming to us in &s;heep's cloathing." And let me add, tho' it may perhaps be a paradox to &s;ome, That a great lye does not become ab&s;olutely no lye, by being told by a <HI>great</HI> man, or a <HI>grave</HI> one, or a young one of a <HI>genteel</HI> education: No; not even tho' the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> puni&s;hes lying in little &s;inners, and the <HI>&s;econd</HI> preaches again&s;t it in the laiety, while the <HI>third</HI> affects to be thunder|&s;truck, as it were, with the very mention of it!&mdash;It were well if people as generally and &s;incerely abhorred this &s;ervile, &s;ordid, execrable vice, as they di&s;like the imputation, and dread to lye under the &s;candal of it.

Let tho&s;e of you therefore, my young brethren, that have delicate ears, or nice notions of honor, have true, &s;incere and upright hearts al&s;o; and mouths undefiled with lying. In the language of the p&s;almi&s;t, "keep your tongues from evil, and your lips from &s;peaking guile&mdash;For lying lips are an abomination to the Lord."

<P>SUFFERING the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions to reign in, and to be ma&s;ters over you, is plainly incompatible with &s;obriety of mind, unle&s;s madne&s;s and &s;obriety are con&s;i&s;tent with each other. In every &s;ober mind, rea&s;on is predominant; keep|ing all the pa&s;&s;ions, and particularly anger and re&s;entment, under &s;ubjection, or within its pro|per bounds. Any man, whether young or old, who is often as it were drunk with anger and revenge, is as far from being a &s;ober one, as if he were as often intoxicated with &s;trong drink. Nay, the former is, of the two, rather more criminal than the latter; there being nothing &s;o directly contrary to that love or charity, which is the bond of perfectne&s;s, the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, and the fulfilling of the law, as a wrathful, revengeful and implacable &s;pirit.

<P>THE angry pa&s;&s;ions are as natural to man|kind as any other: They are born, and al&s;o grow up with us to a criminal exce&s;s, unle&s;s prevented by a religious education, and the grace of God. This is the true meaning of an expre&s;&s;ion in one of St. Paul's epi&s;tles, of|ten perverted to an un&s;criptural and horrid, if not bla&s;phemous &s;en&s;e&mdash;<Q>Among whom we all had our conver&s;ation in times pa&s;t, in the lu&s;ts of our fle&s;h, fulfilling the de&s;ires of the fle&s;h, and of the mind; and were <HI>by nature children of wrath,</HI> even as others.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"> Eph. II 3. N. B. TEKNA PHUSEI ORGEES, ("by nature children of wrath") according to the Greek idiom, &s;ignifies children naturally of a wrathful <HI>temper,</HI> or angry <HI>di&s;po&s;ition;</HI> the <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of wrath con&s;ider'd as a <HI>pa&s;&s;ion inherent in,</HI> and natural to them: Not the <HI>objects</HI> of God's anger, as if they were odious to him, or under his wrath, even from their birth. Neither does TEKNA, [children] here, any more intend <HI>infants</HI> ju&s;t born, than the &s;ame word means infants in almo&s;t numberle&s;s other places. Thus in this &s;ame Epi&s;tle, Ch. 5 1. "Be ye followers of God as dear <HI>children.</HI>"&mdash;And ch. 6. 1. <HI>Children,</HI> obey your parents in the Lord"&mdash;So I John 3. 10. "In this the <HI>children</HI> of God are mani|fe&s;t,"&mdash;And Rom. 8. 17. If <HI>children,</HI> then heirs, heirs of God," &amp;c. In the language of &s;cripture adult, and even aged per&s;ons, are all &s;tyled children. Nor is there any rea&s;on for under&s;tanding <HI>infants</HI> hereby, in this famous text. It was indeed before allowed that anger, or wrath, is a pa&s;&s;ion that is <HI>natural</HI> to mankind, and born with us as our other pa&s;&s;ions are. And if it is indulged afterwards to exce&s;s, it doubtle&s;s becomes criminal in the &s;ight of God. This is the utmo&s;t that can be made of this place. To &s;up|po&s;e the meaning of it is, that even <HI>infants,</HI> are objects of God's wrath, is to put a &s;en&s;e upon it which the Greek will not well admit: And it is be&s;ides, a mo&s;t irrational, un|&s;criptural interpretation&mdash;What ideas mu&s;t tho&s;e have of the ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s and mercy of God, who imagine that in|fants ju&s;t born, are the objects of his wrath? yea, that many of them, without actual &s;inning, are eternally dam|ned!

XI. AN <HI>envious</HI> temper is incon&s;i&s;tent with true &s;obriety of mind. This is an unea&s;y pa&s;&s;ion that is well known, ari&s;ing from ob|&s;erving the real or &s;uppo&s;ed felicity of others, in &s;ome one or more re&s;pects, on a compari|&s;on of our own condition with theirs; being a particular modification of inordinate &s;elf-love, or a natural re&s;ult thereof.

So that envy is a criminal impo|tence of mind, &s;tanding in oppo&s;ition to rea&s;onable &s;elf-love, and contentment with our own condition, and to that charity which delighteth in the felicity of others. The en|vious man thinks that he has too little, and the object of his envy too much, of what he con&s;iders as good and de&s;ireable in its nature. From hence re&s;ults that peculiar feeling or &s;entiment, expre&s;&s;ed by the term envy; at once irrational and criminal; nor le&s;s tor|menting to the mind &s;ubject thereto, than the wracks of the cruele&s;t tyrants are to the bodies of their &s;laves.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><LG>

<P>THERE are divers kinds of leudne&s;s and im|purity, which belong to this head, be&s;ides adul|tery and fornication in the common gro&s;s &s;en&s;e. We read in &s;cripture of "committing adultery in the <HI>heart;</HI>" and of &s;ome per&s;ons who have "<HI>eyes</HI> full of adultery, and that cannot cea&s;e from &s;in." All ob&s;cene, la&s;civious or uncha&s;te <HI>words,</HI> are al&s;o criminal: To which the apo&s;tle refers, when he &s;ays, "Fornication, and all un|cleanne&s;s, let it not be once <HI>named</HI> among you, as

<P>Now, my young brethren, if you are &s;ober-minded, you will keep your&s;elves pure from all the&s;e abominations; again&s;t which the wrath of God is &s;o plainly revealed from heaven. Parti|cularly, you will avoid all forbidden intercour&s;e with leud, pro&s;titute and infamous women; of whom, it is &s;aid, there are many among&s;t us. I know not; but wherever they are, they may ju&s;tly be accounted the di&s;grace, not only of their own &s;ex, but of human nature; the pe&s;ts of &s;ociety; the contempt and abhorrence of all good men; the daughters of &s;atan, and the ex|ecration of the Almighty. And will you give your &s;ub&s;tance, your &s;trength, your honor, to &s;uch infamous wretches as the&s;e; who thir&s;t for your wealth, who lay wait for the precious life, and who&s;e doors are the gates of hell! Would you di&s;honour the members of Chri&s;t?&mdash;would you defile the temple of God, which is holy, with &s;uch filthy and dete&s;table, tho' probably painted and gilded idols!&mdash;Or, as to any of that &s;ex, who are yet undebauched, would you be "fir&s;t in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion?" Would, or could you, if you tho't of the matter, be guilty of &s;o di&s;honourable, &s;o ba&s;e, &s;o cruel a thing, as to en|tice

And if the per&s;on thus en&s;nared and ruined by you, &s;hould be one that had any regard for you; this would but increa&s;e the blackne&s;s and horror of the crime, by adding <HI>ingratitude</HI> to it!</P>
<P>THE infinitely wi&s;e and beneficent Author of nature, and of all the &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions, affections and in&s;tincts in mankind, has, by his expre&s;s laws and in&s;titutions, made provi&s;ion for the re|gular, virtuous and honourable gratification of them. And, in one very material in&s;tance, rela|tive to the point in hand, the following pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture will &s;hew you at once, both what that cour&s;e of life is, which He has ordained, and the great guilt and danger of deviating from it: I mean tho&s;e very grave and &s;ober words of the apo&s;tle Paul&mdash;"To avoid fornication, let EVERY man have his own wife, and EVERY woman her own hu&s;band."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor.

XIII. 4.</NOTE><NOTE N="&rindx;" PLACE="foot"><P>Among the numerous bad effects of pride and luxury in life, the prevention of MARRIAGE is not the lea&s;t. There are many men in the world, who, tho' in circum&s;tances to &s;up|port a family comfortably and decently, will not comply with the order of God and nature, becau&s;e they are not in a capacity to live in &s;uch affluence and &s;plendor as they de&s;ire; &s;uch as their fathers live, or lived in; or &s;uch as many of their acquaintance live in: That is, in other words, becau&s;e they have not much more of the world than they need. And the young, of the other amiable &s;ex, having been brought up in a delicate, &s;umptuous way, will not marry, perhaps, till they have the offer of &s;uch matches, that they can imme|diately be maintained near, if not quite, in as genteel and grand a manner as that, in which they were brought up in their fathers hou&s;es; or that in which they &s;ee &s;ome of their contemporaries live. The&s;e are facts, as to many per&s;ons of both &s;exes. But how irrational is it, that young gentlemen and ladies &s;hould expect to begin the world with as much equipage and grandeur, or to live <HI>at fir&s;t</HI> in as &s;umptuous a manner as their parents could well do <HI>at la&s;t,</HI> after having, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God on many years indu&s;try, acquired riches? Can any expect that their parents &s;hould either make away with them&s;elves, or give up all to them while they live? One of the&s;e would be nece&s;&s;ary in order to their living in the like affluence. Nor would even this &s;uffice, ex|cept in a few ca&s;es. For mo&s;t parents have more than one, two or three children; many have &s;ix, eight, ten, or more, to inherit their e&s;tates. So that giving up all to be divided among&s;t them, would not put them into &s;uch circum&s;tances, as to enable them to live in the &s;ame manner in which they were brought up. Which, or &s;omething very near it, is what many &s;eem to in&s;i&s;t on, as the condition of their entering into the marriage &s;tate. Vain and extravagant imagination in|deed! It is to expect what is naturally impo&s;&s;ible. And the con&s;equence hereof is, that many per&s;ons live all their days, and more &s;till, much the greater and better part of them, in an unnatural &s;tate, contrary to the expre&s;s ordi|nance of God. And many of the men who live thus, betake them&s;elves to &s;uch po&s;itively vicious cour&s;es, (it is needle&s;s to &s;ay in <HI>what re&s;pects</HI>) as are at once di&s;honourable to them|&s;elves, ruinous to many per&s;ons of the other &s;ex, of low con|dition, and as render both, the nu&s;ances and di&s;grace of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides: the increa&s;e of mankind is hereby prevented. For as to tho&s;e who live continently all their days in a &s;ingle &s;tate, (whether many or few) they are the occa&s;ion of no addition to the numbers of &s;ociety: They are "written childle&s;s;" and do not leave any to &s;upply even their own places, when they are taken off the &s;tage. And as to tho&s;e who live other|wi&s;e, in a promi&s;cuous or lawle&s;s concubinage; the experi|ence of all ages has verified one part of the cur&s;e denounced again&s;t &s;uch per&s;ons, by the God of nature and order, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <Q>They &s;hall commit whoredom, <HI>but they &s;hall not increa&s;e;</HI> becau&s;e they have left off to take heed to the Lord.</Q> [Hos. iv. 10.] That is, they &s;hall not <HI>increa&s;e</HI> in any &s;ort of propor|tion to tho&s;e who ob&s;erve the divine in&s;titution of marriage. So that, in&s;tead of leaving behind them <HI>many &s;ons</HI> and <HI>daugh|ters</HI> honourably born, for the &s;upport, increa&s;e and ornament of &s;ociety, they furni&s;h it only with a <HI>few b-&s;t-rds;</HI> who are al&s;o commonly brought up in &s;uch a way, unhappy per&s;ons! as gives them&s;elves, their guilty parents and the common-wealth, cau&s;e rather to wi&s;h they had <HI>never been,</HI> than the contrary! There are, indeed, &s;ome per&s;ons born under the&s;e unhappy circum&s;tances, who prove real ornaments and ble&s;|&s;ings to &s;ociety: Nor ought any of them to be de&s;pi&s;ed mere|ly on account of their having had &s;uch profligate parents.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a few of the many civil and political bad con&s;equences of celibacy; one principal occa&s;ion of which in this country, is that "pride of life, which is not of the Father, but of the world:"&mdash;A kind of pride, which will not permit people to marry, unle&s;s they have much more than nature requires; and can live, not only comfortably, but in &s;plendor, make a figure in the world, and "fare &s;umptuou&s;ly every day:"&mdash;A kind of pride, which &s;eems to be growing upon us in&s;tead of abating, and threatens the wor&s;t of evils, temporal and eternal. It is partly owing to this, that not a few per&s;ons are arrived at &s;uch effrontery and impiety in their celibate, crimi|nal way of life, as even to <HI>defame</HI> the original in&s;titution of Heaven, and that <HI>&s;tate</HI> which the Spirit of God has &s;ince de|clared <HI>honourable in all.</HI> This is one of the &s;ure&s;t evidences of a gro&s;ly depraved mind. And I cannot but add, that that pride of life, which is one principal means of preventing marriage, is of much wor&s;e con&s;equence in a young country, thin of inhabitants, than in an old one, already nearly, or perhaps fully peopled.</P></NOTE></P>

Neither may &s;ons, &s;ervants or apprentices be, in any re&s;pect, unfaithful to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them re&s;pectively.

I HARDLY need to add, after this, that you are all in general, both tho&s;e that are minors, and tho&s;e that are of age to act for your&s;elves, to be &s;trictly ju&s;t and upright in all your deal|ings and intercour&s;e with others; doing to them "whatever you would that they &s;hould do to you." For this is not only the law, the prophets, and the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; but the dictate of nature; and found, almo&s;t in the &s;ame words, in &s;ome of the heathen morali&s;ts. So that all inju&s;tice, iniquity and fraud towards man, of every kind and degree, is repugnant to the light of nature, as well as to chri&s;tian &s;obriety, and the &s;trict morals of the go&s;pel. I may therefore di&s;mi&s;s the pre&s;ent head, with this brief mention of it; only referring you to the holy &s;criptures, and to your own con&s;ciences, which will at once con&s;ent to every thing en|joined therein, relative to ju&s;tice betwixt man and man.&mdash;I proceed therefore to ob&s;erve, in the next place,</P>
<P>XV. THAT an <HI>avaritious, covetous</HI> and <HI>worldly</HI> di&s;po&s;ition, or the immoderate de&s;ire and love of riches, is al&s;o repugnant to &s;obriety. <Q>He that maketh ha&s;te to be rich, &s;ays Solomon, &s;hall not be innocent.</Q>&mdash;And, "they that will be rich," &s;ays the apo&s;tle Paul, "fall into temp|tation, and a &s;nare, and into many fooli&s;h and hurtful lu&s;ts, which drown men in de&s;truction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while &s;ome coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced them&s;elves thro' with many &s;orrows." And our
<PB N="202" REF="009440_0217_0F75441FB95FDDC0">
ble&s;&s;ed Saviour has &s;aid, "Lay not up for your|&s;elves trea&s;ures upon earth"&mdash;"Take heed and beware of covetou&s;ne&s;s." He &s;peaks of a &s;trong attachment to the world, as ab&s;olutely incon|&s;i&s;tent with true religion; &s;aying, <Q>No man can &s;erve two ma&s;ters; for either he will hate the one and love the other; or el&s;e he will hold to the one, and de&s;pi&s;e the other. <HI>Ye cannot &s;erve God and mammon.</HI></Q></P>
<P>COVETOUSNESS is indeed commonly and ju&s;tly accounted the vice rather of old age, than of youth. However, in&s;tances of it even in the latter, are not &s;o rare and extraordinary, as to render a caution of this nature &s;uperfluous or inexpedient in a di&s;cour&s;e to young men. The apo&s;tle John, to be &s;ure, did not think &s;uch ad|monitions needle&s;s for them. For it is more particularly and directly to young men, that he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle&mdash;<Q>I have written unto you, young men&mdash;Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him&mdash;And the world pa&s;&s;eth away, and the lu&s;t thereof, but he that doeth the will of God, abideth forever.</Q></P>
<P>As I ju&s;t now intimated to you, there are &s;ome examples of a covetous, worldly temper even in young men: And there is one melan|cholly in&s;tance hereof recorded in the new te&s;tament. The &s;tory is related by three of the evangeli&s;ts,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. Ch. XIX. Mark Ch. X. and Luke Ch. XVIII.</NOTE> without any con&s;iderable variation; and it is particularly worthy of your &s;erious at|tention. This unhappy young man came to our
<PB N="203" REF="009440_0218_0F75442045C37E90">
Saviour with an apparent, and doubtle&s;s &s;ome real concern, about the &s;alvation of his &s;oul; &s;aying, "Good ma&s;ter, what good thing &s;hall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?" By what follows, it appears that he was free from all gro&s;s and &s;candalous vices, in the u&s;ual &s;en&s;e of the&s;e terms. And one of the evangeli&s;ts &s;ays, that "Je&s;us beholding him, loved him." However, our Lord knowing at the &s;ame time, that the love of this world reigned in his heart; perceiv|ing al&s;o, that he had far too high an opinion of his own virtues and righteou&s;ne&s;s; and being willing to prove him, and &s;hew him to him&s;elf, &s;aid, "If thou wilt be perfect, go and &s;ell that thou ha&s;t, and give to the poor, and thou &s;halt have trea&s;ure in heaven: And come and follow me." But the manner in which he received this coun&s;el and admonition, and his conduct there|on, as related in the next ver&s;e, &s;hews that even this apparently &s;erious young man, who was, in &s;ome re&s;pects, beloved by our Lord, &s;till pre|ferred a pre&s;ent trea&s;ure on earth, to a future one in heaven, that faileth not. For it is &s;aid, "But when the young man heard that &s;aying, he went away &s;orrowful; for he had great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions." From whence our Saviour took occa&s;ion to admoni&s;h all that were pre&s;ent, con|cerning the deceitfulne&s;s of riches, the danger attending them, and the fatal con&s;equences of a worldly mind; &s;aying, "Verily, I &s;ay unto you, that a rich man &s;hall hardly enter into the king|dom of heaven." Or, as it is expre&s;&s;ed in ano|ther evangeli&s;t, "How hardly &s;hall they that have riches, enter into the kingdom of God!"</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="009440_0219_0F754420DD4773F0">
Now, if you are truly wi&s;e, you will not follow the example of this unhappy young man; but con&s;ider it as left upon record for your warning: And not &s;uffer the love of gold that peri&s;heth, to reign in your hearts, in&s;tead of the love of Chri&s;t and of God, and of the true riches;&mdash;that far more excellent, enduring &s;ub&s;tance and trea&s;ure in the heavens, "where neither moth nor ru&s;t doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break thro' nor &s;teal." The inordinate love of riches is ab&s;olutely incon|&s;i&s;tent with chri&s;tian &s;obriety. There is hardly any &s;urer evidence of a &s;ordid and in&s;ane mind than this: So far is it from being compatible with a truly &s;ober one.</P>
<P>IT is not the de&s;ign of the&s;e &s;criptural coun|&s;els and warnings re&s;pecting riches, that you &s;hould have ab&s;olutely no regard for them; much le&s;s, that you &s;hould wholly neglect all worldly affairs, bu&s;ine&s;s and commerce, under a pretence of being heavenly-minded: A notion which &s;ome lazy people, and dreaming enthu&s;ia&s;ts have e&s;pou&s;ed; thinking to be &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in idle|ne&s;s by the labor and alms of others. Wealth is the gift of God, and con&s;idered in &s;cripture as one of tho&s;e worldly ble&s;&s;ings, for which men ought to be thankful to the Father of lights. It is therefore, tho' a trial, yet a real good; and not to be ab&s;olutely de&s;pi&s;ed. In the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a wi&s;e and good man, it may contribute not only to the comfort of his own life; but enable him to do much good in the world in divers ways, particularly in the honourable capacity of God's

almoner to the poor: While fools, or wicked men, are often the more unhappy them&s;elves, and do hurt to others, by means of tho&s;e riches which they abu&s;e. Solomon recommends an hone&s;t indu&s;try, as the natural and appointed means of providing a comfortable livelihood; &s;aying. "Go to the ant, thou &s;luggard; con&s;ider her ways, and be wi&s;e: Which having no guide, over&s;eer, or ruler, provideth her meat in the &s;ummer, and gathereth her food in the harve&s;t." The apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays, as from the Lord, that "if any will not work, neither &s;hould they eat." There is much more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e in the new te&s;tament: And it would be a great per|ver&s;ion of our Saviour's words&mdash;"Labor not for the meat that peri&s;heth;"&mdash;"Take no thought for the morrow;"&mdash;and &s;uch-like admonitions, to under&s;tand them as prohibiting that prudent care and diligence, in order to provide for our&s;elves, and "that we may have to give to him that needeth," which are po&s;itively enjoined in many other parts of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>THE true &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture upon this head, is in general this: That tho' you ought to be indu&s;trious in &s;ome hone&s;t cour&s;e of life, and to be thankful to God, if he be&s;tows riches upon you; yet you are always to regard this world, and the peri&s;hing riches of it, in due &s;ubordina|tion to the other, and to tho&s;e far greater and better things, which God has promi&s;ed to them that love him:&mdash;That you &s;hould not be immo|derately &s;et in the pur&s;uit of riches, or gripe them too fa&s;t when acquired, &s;o as to with|hold
<PB N="206" REF="009440_0221_0F75442239D36010">
your alms from the proper objects of it:&mdash;That you &s;hould not tru&s;t in them, but in the living God, who "giveth us richly all things to enjoy:"&mdash;That you &s;hould make &s;uch a wi&s;e and rea&s;onable u&s;e of them, as is agreeable both to nature, and to the will of God; and be ready to part with them at his call, in hope of a better and more enduring &s;ub&s;tance; even tho&s;e things that are "above, where Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;itteth at the right hand of God." Neither are you to ima|gine your&s;elves &s;ober-minded, as Chri&s;tians are obliged to be, till the temper of your minds is conformable to &s;uch &s;ober maxims as the&s;e: For there is nothing in them that favours, in the lea&s;t degree, of <HI>&s;uper&s;tition</HI> or <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m;</HI> which are &s;o far from being the characteri&s;tics of a &s;ober mind, that they are directly repugnant thereto. And this leads me to ob&s;erve more particularly, in the la&s;t place, what was hinted in the former part of this di&s;cour&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>XVI. THAT all <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tic</HI> notions, and <HI>&s;uper&s;titious</HI> practices, &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to chri&s;tian &s;obriety; and ought to be guarded again&s;t. A &s;ober mind is not, &s;urely, an in|&s;ane, fanciful, over-heated or raving one; but a &s;ound, compo&s;ed and rational mind; a mind well-informed with the knowledge of God, and of true religion; and, upon rational prin|ciples, or proper grounds of conviction of the truth, excellency and importance of chri&s;ti|anity, firmly attached to it, as it was preached by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. All enthu&s;ia&s;tic rants and conceits, all &s;uper&s;titious notions and
<PB N="207" REF="009440_0222_0F75442416F06BD8">
practices; I mean, all &s;uch as are warranted neither by rea&s;on, nor by the holy &s;criptures, are therefore repugnant to &s;obriety.</P>
<P>THAT &s;obriety of mind ought to be con&s;i|dered in oppo&s;ition to all &s;uch fancies, and reli|gious madne&s;s, is very obvious from one pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture at lea&s;t, directly in point. It is in the Acts of the apo&s;tles,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. XXVI. 24, 25.</NOTE> and was referred to before. We there find the apo&s;tle Paul giving a particular account of his conver&s;ion to the Faith of Chri&s;t, before King Agrippa, and Fe&s;tus the governor; apologizing for him&s;elf, and &s;peak|ing of the truth and evidences of chri&s;tianity. <Q>And as he thus &s;pake for him&s;elf, Fe&s;tus &s;aid with a loud voice, Paul, thou art <HI>be&s;ide thy&s;elf;</HI> much learning doth make thee <HI>mad.</HI></Q> Whether Fe&s;tus &s;pake &s;incerely or ironically about the apo&s;tle's learning, is not at pre&s;ent material: It is evident that he thought him <HI>now</HI> di&s;ordered in his mind, and a religious, raving enthu&s;ia&s;t. Upon which the apo&s;tle calmly and re&s;pectfully replied, <Q>I am not <HI>mad,</HI> mo&s;t noble Fe&s;tus; but &s;peak forth <HI>the words of truth</HI> and <HI>&s;oberne&s;s.</HI></Q> In which an&s;wer, you perceive that &s;peaking the words of "truth and &s;oberne&s;s," &s;tands in oppo|&s;ition to the reproachful charge as to his being "be&s;ide him&s;elf" and "mad." One obvious remark upon this piece of hi&s;tory, is, that men of dark and depraved minds may <HI>mis-call</HI> truth and &s;oberne&s;s, madne&s;s: For &s;uch men receive not the things of the &s;pirit of God; which are fooli&s;hne&s;s and madne&s;s to them. This, how|ever, does not in the lea&s;t invalidate, but rather
<PB N="208" REF="009440_0223_0F7544249F5BE0B8">
confirms the other ob&s;ervation, that <HI>real</HI> enthu|&s;ia&s;m, or religious madne&s;s, actually &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to true &s;obriety of mind, how often &s;oever one may be <HI>mi&s;taken</HI> for the other.</P>
<P>IF therefore, you a&s;pire to be &s;ober-minded, you are always, and in all things, to be govern|ed by right rea&s;on, truth, rational evidence, and the genuine doctrines and duties of chri&s;tianity; and to be upon your guard again&s;t all wild no|tions and conceits; all &s;uper&s;tition and enthu&s;i|a&s;m, whether in principle or in practice.&mdash;Tho' there have been times and places, wherein it &s;eemed, by the preaching chiefly in vogue, to be an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, that people, and particu|larly the young, mu&s;t be fir&s;t put "be&s;ide them|&s;elves," and made "mad," by a furious applica|tion to their pa&s;&s;ions, with little or no &s;olid in&s;truction to their minds, in order to make them &s;ober! Yea, &s;obriety of mind &s;eems to have been thought by many, to con&s;i&s;t chiefly in an heated imagination, in wild, un&s;criptural fancies, and in &s;uch con&s;equential practices, both in re&s;pect of religion, and the affairs of common life, as are directly repugnant to all true &s;obriety, or a &s;ound mind. And young people need to be particularly cautioned again&s;t the&s;e delu&s;ions and infatuations; being, through in|experience, the warmth of their blood, and the &s;trength of their pa&s;&s;ions, peculiarly expo&s;ed to them; e&s;pecially when recommended to them either by a very &s;oft and delicate, or a tragical, boi&s;terous and outrageous addre&s;s.</P>

SUPERSTITION and enthu&s;ia&s;m are not, in|deed, commonly con&s;idered as <HI>vicious,</HI> or any ways <HI>criminal</HI> in their nature; but rather only as innocent human infirmities. But it is not ea&s;y to &s;ee, why they &s;hould be treated with &s;o much tenderne&s;s, except in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, wherein they appear to have their origin in cor|poreal di&s;orders. When this is the ca&s;e, the &s;ubjects of them are to be pitied, like other unhappy people under a total or partial di&s;trac|tion, ari&s;ing from &s;imilar di&s;orders in the animal frame. But &s;uch ca&s;es as the&s;e being excepted, they are real and great vices of the mind; I mean, where-ever they are found in a great degree. For they &s;trongly imply a criminal mi&s;u&s;e of the under&s;tanding, and of the word of God; which, being rightly u&s;ed, would effectually pre&s;erve people from the&s;e errors and delu&s;ions. A per|&s;on that makes &s;uch u&s;e of his rea&s;on, and of the holy &s;criptures, as he ought in duty to make, never did, never will, never can fall into the errors of a raving, wild enthu&s;ia&s;m; &s;o contrary to all true &s;obriety, and &s;o fruitful of mi&s;chief in the world. For all which mi&s;chiefs the en|thu&s;ia&s;t is as much accountable, as the drunkard, and the man who&s;e anger has got the better of his rea&s;on, are for the di&s;orders and outrages committed by them re&s;pectively.</P>
<P>ENTHUSIASTS are commonly full of pride, &s;elf-conceit, wrath and bitterne&s;s. All their dreams and reveries are &s;acred with them, all divine: And they who dare to contradict or di&s;pute them, are of con&s;equence hereticks, un|converted,

wicked men, the enemies of God. Hence ra&s;h judging and condemning: Hence fatal breaches in families, among&s;t neighbours, in churches, in civil &s;ocieties: Hence envying and &s;trife, and every evil work. Enthu&s;ia&s;m is gene|rally outrageous and cruel as the grave, under a pretence of zeal for religion and the glory of God. They who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this evil &s;pirit in a great degree, commonly think they can nei|ther &s;ay nor do too much again&s;t tho&s;e, upon whom, in the pride and naughtine&s;s of their hearts, they have waged war, as unorthodox ene|mies to the mo&s;t High: Conceiting that by "killing them, they would do God &s;ervice."

<P>ENTHUSIASM has, perhaps, been productive of as much evil in the world, as the mo&s;t flagrant and acknowledged immoralities: Yea, it leads na|turally and directly to &s;uch immoralities; as was intimated before.

Let me therefore, in the fear of God, and in friend&s;hip to you, warn you never to forget that you are rea&s;onable creatures.

<Q>YOUNG MEN <HI>likewi&s;e exhort to be &s;ober-minded.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MY young brethren, in the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e upon this &s;ubject, a variety of ob&s;erva|tions were made upon the text, by way of introduction to the main de&s;ign.</P>
<P>IN the two next di&s;cour&s;es, the nature of chri&s;|tian &s;obriety was &s;omewhat di&s;tinctly explained, and cur&s;orily recommended to you.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="009440_0231_0F75442B44AE0B38">
IN the two la&s;t di&s;cour&s;es, &s;ome of the many &s;ins, follies and criminal exce&s;&s;es which are con|trary to &s;obriety, were particularly mentioned to you; from all which you were warned to ab&s;tain.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;poken of nothing as a truth to be believed, or a duty to be practi&s;ed by you, as a branch of this &s;obriety, without a&s;&s;igning &s;ome rea&s;on or rea&s;ons for it, how briefly &s;oever. Neither, on the other hand, has any thing been mentioned as repugnant to &s;obriety, without of|fering &s;omething to your con&s;ideration, by way of di&s;&s;wa&s;ive from it. So that I have, in effect, been exhorting you to be &s;ober-minded, while my profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign was rather only to explain what is intended thereby, and to &s;hew you what is incon&s;i&s;tent therewith. But it has been my intention all along, by the will of God,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, More largely and di&s;tinctly to ex|hort you to this &s;obriety of mind, and to di&s;|&s;wade you from the contrary.</P>
<P>I SHALL, accordingly, now proceed to this branch of my de&s;ign, by laying before you &s;uch con&s;iderations and arguments of various kinds, as may be effectual to per&s;wade you to be &s;ober-minded, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God concurring; or el&s;e, if they are di&s;regarded, will leave you the more inexcu&s;eable. Which I pray God, may not be the ca&s;e with any of you: Though if it &s;hould, it will be nothing that is unu&s;ual;&mdash;nothing but what often happened of old, under the preach|ing of the apo&s;tles them&s;elves, who were &s;o emi|nently faithful to God, and to the &s;ouls of men. Con&s;cious of this fidelity, they left the <HI>event,</HI> the
<PB N="217" REF="009440_0232_0F75442C55101AE8">
<HI>&s;ucce&s;s</HI> of their labour of love, with God; in full a&s;&s;urance of his gracious approbation, whatever <HI>that</HI> might be. Whether their hearers received and reli&s;hed the word preached, to their &s;alva|tion, or di&s;reli&s;hed and rejected it, to their de&s;truction; yet they knew their own conduct with re&s;pect to both, would be acceptable to God, who is plea&s;ed with the faithfulne&s;s of his &s;ervants, whether &s;ucce&s;sful or not. The&s;e are the &s;entiments, which one of the chief of the apo&s;tles expre&s;&s;es in the following words: <Q>We are unto God a &s;weet &s;avour of Chri&s;t in them that are &s;aved, and in them that peri&s;h. To the one we are the &s;avour of death unto death; and to the other the &s;avour of life unto life&mdash;For we are not as many which corrupt the word of God; but as of &s;incerity, but as of God, &s;o &s;peak we in Chri&s;t.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. Ch. II.</NOTE></P>
<P>LET me briefly premi&s;e a few things here, be|fore I proceed to the propo&s;ed exhortation. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. AN exhortation to &s;obriety, implies the u&s;e of argument, of &s;ober and &s;olid rea&s;ons, adde&s;&s;ed to the under&s;tanding. General coun&s;els, or loud, pathetic exclamations, addre&s;&s;ed &s;olely to the pa&s;&s;ions; or merely calling upon people to be &s;ober-minded, without &s;uch intelligible motives as are adapted to influence a rea&s;onable mind, does not de&s;erve the name of chri&s;tian exhortation: It is but empty harrangue and declamation; from which no good and la&s;ting effects can be expect|ed, how much &s;oever per&s;ons may be moved and agitated thereby for a time. I &s;hall there|fore con&s;ider you as rea&s;onable creatures; and
<PB N="218" REF="009440_0233_0F75442CFA9329B8">
make u&s;e of &s;uch arguments and con&s;iderations, as are adapted to work upon a rational mind.</P>
<P N="2">2. THESE arguments will be of a general nature; re&s;pecting &s;obriety of mind in that large, comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e, in which it was explained in the preceeding di&s;cour&s;es, rather than any &s;ingle branches of it. For the particular parts or branches thereof, have had &s;o much &s;aid upon them re&s;pectively already, that it is the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t upon them now. And it will be more expedient and u&s;eful, to urge upon you &s;obriety of mind in general, con&s;idered as con|taining all tho&s;e particulars that have been &s;epa|rately &s;poken of.</P>
<P N="3">3. THO' &s;ome of the&s;e arguments will be of le&s;s weight than others; yet none of them, it is hoped, will be unworthy to be mentioned in a grave di&s;cour&s;e, or unde&s;erving of your regard. There is nothing of any real weight, that can be &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, but what may properly claim attention, in proportion to that weight. And it mu&s;t needs be, that in a great number of arguments for &s;obriety, there mu&s;t be a differ|rence in re&s;pect of their importance: They cannot all be of the &s;ame, or equal force; tho' they may all be according to truth, nature, rea&s;on and &s;cripture. Some of tho&s;e which I &s;hall offer to your con&s;ideration, are, I think, as weighty as the heart of man can conceive; and none of them, I hope, &s;uperficial, fanciful or un&s;olid. But you &s;hall judge of them your|&s;elves: For, I neither claim nor de&s;ire a blind, implicit deference to any thing which I &s;ay, even
<PB N="219" REF="009440_0234_0F75442F740A8E38">
from the young; but aim at giving you rational conviction: Without which there can be no religion, whether in principle or practice, be|coming rea&s;onable creatures; nor, con&s;equently, any thing that de&s;erves the name of chri&s;tian &s;obriety, either in the young or the old.</P>
<P N="4">4. THESE arguments will have a primary re&s;pect to tho&s;e per&s;ons, that are not yet &s;ober-minded; being de&s;igned and adapted both to awaken and to encourage &s;uch; to &s;hew them, on one hand, the fatal con&s;equences of per&s;e|vering in their &s;inful cour&s;es; and on the other, the rea&s;onablene&s;s, and many advantages of &s;obriety. But,</P>
<P N="5">5. THO' the following con&s;iderations will be chiefly adapted to the &s;tate of the vicious; yet they may be of u&s;e to all tho&s;e per&s;ons, whether old or young, that are already &s;ober-minded; by confirming them in the faith and practice of religion; by encouraging them to "go on unto perfection;" and &s;hewing them the danger, either of a total or partial decline from "the right ways of the Lord." It is hoped, there are &s;ome of the young among&s;t us, that are truly &s;ober-minded; who may yet greatly need encouragement and confirmation in the faith, and in the continued practice of their duty. Neither would I have it &s;uppo&s;ed, that I conclude there are none &s;uch, becau&s;e I addre&s;s my&s;elf more e&s;pecially to tho&s;e unhappy young men that are, or may be, of a contrary character.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="009440_0235_0F7544300D163070">
THESE things being premi&s;ed, my young brethren, what I would fir&s;t of all propo&s;e to your con&s;ideration, is,</P>
<P>I. THAT this &s;obriety, con&s;idered in one entire view as it has been explained, is a mo&s;t <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> thing. Rea&s;on is a noble prerogative which God has given you; whereby you are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the fowls of heaven, and from the bea&s;t of the field; from the hor&s;e and mule which have no under&s;tanding. It &s;hould, therefore, be your ambition, an ambition truly laudable, to act up to your rational character in all re&s;pects; and never to degrade or di&s;honor your&s;elves, by a conduct repugnant thereto. This, in general, you will all readily acknow|ledge. And, to apply it to the grand point in view; what is there,&mdash;what can there be, &s;o rea&s;onable, as that you &s;hould be &s;ober-minded, or truly religious? This is the &s;um of human rea&s;on, of human wi&s;dom, reduced to practice: For which cau&s;e, in the writings of Solomon, wi&s;dom is only another name for religion, or &s;obriety; and folly, only another name for irreligion and vice. There is nothing that de|&s;erves the title of wi&s;dom, in compari&s;on of the former, which &s;o much excels every thing el&s;e that pa&s;&s;es under the &s;ame name;&mdash;nothing which de&s;erves the title of folly, in compari&s;on of the latter, which &s;o much &s;urpa&s;&s;eth all other folly. So the wi&s;e man explains him&s;elf, when he &s;ays, "the fooli&s;hne&s;s of fools is folly;" i. e. the folly of irreligious, wicked men, is em|phatically folly, the greate&s;t that can be con|ceived
<PB N="221" REF="009440_0236_0F7544307AD89728">
of: All other folly is a kind of wi&s;dom, in compari&s;on of this. On the other hand, all other pretended wi&s;dom is but folly, in compari&s;on of knowing God and keeping his commandments.</P>
<P>NONE, certainly, but a fool, can &s;ay in his heart, "There is no God." And if there be a God, the Creator and Lord of all, perfect in power, wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c. is it not evidently a mo&s;t rea&s;onable thing to love, reve|rence, honor, tru&s;t in and obey him, even with all the heart, &s;oul, &s;trength and mind? What greater folly, what &s;urer mark of in&s;anity can there po&s;&s;ibly be, than to contemn or di&s;regard, to affront and di&s;obey the only living and true God? Will you abu&s;e language &s;o much, as to call any One that does &s;o, a rea&s;onable and wi&s;e man! Moreover: If Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Son of God, came into this world to enlighten, to re|deem and &s;ave it, according to the &s;cripture-account, of which there is rational, conclu&s;ive, abundant evidence; then, certainly, you are bound in rea&s;on to believe in him; to re&s;pect and honor him in the high relation of a "mediator between God and men;" to &s;ubmit your&s;elves to his teaching and authority, to believe his words, to tru&s;t in him, and to obey all the laws of his kingdom, or the commandments of God as promulgated by him, in the name, and by the authority of the Father. What can be more, I will not now &s;ay, wicked and impious, but more irrational and fooli&s;h, than either to reject tho&s;e many "infallible proofs," which there are of Chri&s;t's divine mi&s;&s;ion, and the truth of his
<PB N="222" REF="009440_0237_0F754431499ACD20">
go&s;pel, or to de&s;pi&s;e him, and to di&s;obey his com|mandments, which are &s;o holy ju&s;t and good?</P>
<P>THERE are, comparatively &s;peaking, but few things required of you as duties, in and by the go&s;pel, but what even the light of nature &s;hews to be &s;uch; but few things forbidden as &s;inful thereby, but what even your own rea&s;on and con&s;ciences might tell you, are wrong and crimi|nal. This is true of all the moral precepts and prohibitions of the go&s;pel; which are far the greater part. The rea&s;onablene&s;s of the&s;e, con|&s;idered in their own nature, independently of any revelation, is obvious to tho&s;e who will duly at|tend to them.</P>
<P>As to the other commandments of the go&s;pel, which do not belong to the head of moral pre|cepts; the things required or forbidden in them, are mo&s;tly &s;uch as have a clo&s;e and immediate connexion with the truth of Chri&s;tianity &s;pecula|tively con&s;idered; or with the doctrine concern|ing Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the redemption of the world by him, his re&s;urrection, a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven, the power committed to him by the Father, and his future coming in glory to judge the world. So that if this &s;criptural account of things is true, as it mo&s;t certainly is, the rea&s;onablene&s;s and fitne&s;s of what is required in the go&s;pel in con&s;equence of, and as grounded upon them, is plain and un|deniable. If there are any exceptions, they mu&s;t be tho&s;e two po&s;itive in&s;titutions of the go&s;pel, bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper. For as to public &s;ocial wor&s;hip in general; the rea&s;onablene&s;s there|of has been acknowledged by all civilized na|tions;
<PB N="223" REF="009440_0238_0F754431F98C5C60">
None but an athie&s;t, or mere &s;avage, can even doubt the propriety of it. And as to tho&s;e two po&s;itive precepts; to &s;ay the lea&s;t, there is nothing ab&s;urd, nothing irrational in them. Nay, there is an apparent propriety in them, when con|&s;idered with relation to their known, declared ends: One of them, bapti&s;m, as a vi&s;ible &s;ign of our dedication to God in Chri&s;t, and both an emblem and means of that death to &s;in, of that newne&s;s of life, and that moral purity, to which we are called by the go&s;pel, "thro' &s;anctification of the &s;pirit unto obedience;" from whence it is called, in this epi&s;tle to Titus, "the wa&s;hing of regeneration," and joined with the "renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. III. 5.</NOTE> The other of the&s;e in&s;ti|tutions, the Lord's Supper, is a commemorative rite of that mo&s;t wonderful and intere&s;ting event, the death of the Son of God upon the cro&s;s, in human fle&s;h, for the &s;alvation of &s;inful men: And it is, at the &s;ame time, a natural memento, both of the grace of God to us, and of the obli|gations which we are under to love and obey him. The Lord's Supper, being con&s;idered in this &s;crip|tural light, is evidently a very decent, proper and rea&s;onable in&s;titution; adapted, in its nature, to an&s;wer the mo&s;t excellent moral ends; &s;uch ends as all but athie&s;ts mu&s;t acknowledge to be im|portant; i. e. if gratitude and love to God, righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, charity, purity, and univer&s;al holine&s;s, are of any importance.</P>
<P>IT appears then, my young brethren, That that &s;obriety of mind to which you are exhorted,
<PB N="224" REF="009440_0239_0F754433AC5019D8">
con&s;i&s;ting in a due regard to God, to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to the divine commandments, according to the faith and requi&s;itions of the go&s;pel, is, in the whole of it, highly rea&s;onable; the mo&s;t rational thing in the world. I would not, on any ac|count, exhort you to do what is unrea&s;onable in the lea&s;t degree; either to believe things without proper evidence of their truth, or to act ab&s;urd|ly and irrationally in any other re&s;pect. To be|lieve God's word and to keep it, is, &s;urely, nei|ther of the&s;e. There is abundant proof of what&s;oever you are exhorted to receive as reli|gious truth: And that pious, holy and virtuous life, to which you are called, is the mo&s;t fit, decent and rational life, that any man on earth can lead. Neither can you reject the go&s;pel, or live a life of impiety, &s;in and vice, without con|tradicting, in the mo&s;t di&s;graceful, the mo&s;t di&s;honorable manner, that rea&s;on which God has given you, and on which you may ju&s;tly value your&s;elves. I &s;hall therefore clo&s;e this head of exhortation, with the words of the apo&s;tle Paul: <Q>I be&s;eech you therefore, bre|thren, by the mercies of God, that ye pre|&s;ent your bodies a living &s;acrifice, holy, and acceptable unto God, which is your REASON|ABLE SERVICE.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. XII. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>II. THE far greater part of you, if not all, have, thro' the goodne&s;s of God, been favoured with a virtuous and religious <HI>education.</HI> You have, even from your childhood, been in&s;tructed in the great and fundamental principles of re|ligion,
<PB N="225" REF="009440_0240_0F7544343B6D6100">
both natural and revealed. I might &s;ay to you as the apo&s;tle did to Timothy, then a young man, that <Q>from children you have known the holy &s;criptures, which are able to make you WISE unto &s;alvation, through faith which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</Q>&mdash;tho&s;e &s;criptures which, having been given by in&s;piration of God, are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s; that you might be perfect, and throughly furni&s;hed unto all good works. Having been dedicated to God in your bap|ti&s;m, you were early taught to read the&s;e in|&s;tructive, &s;acred pages, according to the lau|dable practice of this country; receiving at once, or together, the fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons of piety and of human literature. You have al&s;o, proba|bly, often heard the &s;acred oracles read in the families in which you were brought up, in the &s;chools which you frequented, and in the hou&s;e of God. You have had the principal doctrines and duties pertaining to godly &s;o|briety, often incultated upon you by your pa|rents, your &s;chool-ma&s;ters and your mini&s;ters, in private and in public. You have had <Q>line upon line, and precept upon precept.</Q> I may add, that many of you at lea&s;t, have had virtuous and good examples &s;et before you;&mdash;examples of godline&s;s and chri&s;tian &s;obriety, in the families in which you were brought up.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e are great favours in providence, by which you are laid under &s;ome &s;pecial ob|ligations to be &s;ober-minded, in addition to
<PB N="226" REF="009440_0241_0F75443522287220">
tho&s;e which ari&s;e from the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the thing it&s;elf, in its own nature. Your guilt will of con&s;equence be greatly aggrava|ted, if you &s;hould not know God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t; if you &s;hould not remember your Cre|ator, honor, love and obey him, after having been thus in&s;tructed, admoni&s;hed, and train|ed up in the way that you &s;hould go, from your early childhood. Tho&s;e unhappy per|&s;ons who were born and brought up in pla|ces, where the light of the go&s;pel does not &s;hine, or at be&s;t &s;hines but with faint, broken, and ju&s;t-glimmering rays;&mdash;where they have had far le&s;s and fewer advantages for know|ing and doing their duty, than you have en|joyed; (which is the ca&s;e of much the grea|ter part of the young men now in the chri&s;tian world:) Such per&s;ons as the&s;e, I &s;ay, though really inexcu&s;able if they are not &s;ober-mind|ed, are yet far le&s;s criminal, le&s;s culpable in the &s;ight of God and man, than you will be, &s;hould you continue in the practice of vice and folly, after having enjoyed the&s;e &s;uperior re|ligious advantages. I pretend to no peculiar &s;agacity or penetration: But I know &s;o much of the human heart, and the power of natural con&s;cience, that I &s;cruple not to &s;ay po&s;itive|ly, That that faithful witne&s;s for God which is in you, te&s;tifies to the truth and ju&s;tice of what I here &s;ay, if you lend me &s;o much of your attention, as barely to under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>YOU know, my beloved young brethren, and cannot but know, that you are laid under
<PB N="227" REF="009440_0242_0F754435CC906A58">
peculiar, and very &s;trong obligations to &s;o|briety, by the advantages of your birth, childhood and youth, before-mentioned; and that your guilt will be proportionably aggra|vated in the &s;ight of God, to whom all hearts are open, and by whom all actions, with their particular circum&s;tances, are weighed in an equal ballance, if in&s;tead of being &s;ober-minded, you &s;hould per&s;evere in vice and im|piety. Let me therefore exhort you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider of this matter; not only while you are here pre&s;ent before God, but after you are gone from his hou&s;e. If you duly reflect upon the&s;e privileges of your birth and education, and having the things which be|long to your peace, &s;o early and frequently inculcated upon you; it cannot but have &s;ome good influence upon your minds, and future behaviour. And, for your warning not to contemn and di&s;regard the&s;e things, let me remind you of the &s;ad and &s;hameful con|fe&s;&s;ion of a fooli&s;h, heedle&s;s and ob&s;tinate young man; with which I clo&s;e the pre&s;ent argument. It runs thus: <Q>How have I ha|ted in&s;truction, and my heart de&s;pi&s;ed re|proof? and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that in&s;tructed me!<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. Chap. IV.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>III. IF you reflect upon the goodne&s;s of God to you in your <HI>daily pre&s;ervation,</HI> or in the cour&s;e of his <HI>common providence;</HI> this will
<PB N="228" REF="009440_0243_0F754436811B7668">
have a tendency to make you &s;ober-minded. The goodne&s;s of God, even in this view of it, ought to lead you to repentance; which is the principal end thereof. Ever &s;ince you were &s;o fearfully and wonderfully made by him in the womb, and from your birth to the pre&s;ent time, you have been ca&s;t upon him as your guardian, your &s;upport, your friend, your Father. He has daily loaded you with his benefits, and crowned you with loving-kindne&s;s and tender mercies. How numerous are the ble&s;&s;ings which he hath be&s;towed up|on you? From how many evils and dangers has he delivered you, during your feeble in|fant &s;tate, in childhood, and in your riper years?</P>
<P>NOW, God having thus protected, nouri&s;h|ed and brought you up as children; may not heaven and earth well be a&s;toni&s;hed, if you continue to "rebel again&s;t him," in&s;tead of making him that return of gratitude, love and obedience, which is &s;o ju&s;tly required of you! This is a plain and very forcible argument: Nor can it fail to have great weight in your minds, if there is any gratitude and ingenui|ty in them. But as this is a very common ar|gument, I will not enlarge upon it; but clo&s;e it by reminding you of a &s;olemn expo&s;tula|tion of the apo&s;tle, relative to the point&mdash;<Q>De&s;pi&s;e&s;t thou the riches of his goodne&s;s, forbearance and long-&s;uffering; not know|ing that the goodne&s;s of God leadeth thee to repentance? But after thy hardne&s;s and

impenitent heart, trea&s;ure&s;t up unto thy &s;elf wrath, again&s;t the day of wrath&mdash;!</Q><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. Ch. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>IV. NOTWITHSTANDING the goodne&s;s and kindne&s;s of God to you, in the common cour&s;e of his providence, it is likely that he has often <HI>reproved, warned</HI> and <HI>corrected</HI> you, by the vi&s;itations of that &s;ame wi&s;e and good providence;&mdash;by &s;ickne&s;s, by the death of pa|rents, or near relations, friends and compa|nions; or by other afflictive and grievous di&s;pen&s;ations. Now all the&s;e things are to be con&s;idered as kind cha&s;tenings and admoni|tions to you; de&s;igned in providence to awa|ken you to &s;erious reflexion, and as one means of begetting in you that true wi&s;dom and &s;o|briety, to which you are exhorted. And will you "de&s;pi&s;e the cha&s;tening of the Lord?" This were, in &s;ome re&s;pects, an evidence of greater &s;tubborne&s;s and hardne&s;s of heart, than de&s;pi&s;ing the more obvious effects of his good|ne&s;s: I &s;ay, the <HI>more obvious</HI> effects of it; be|cau&s;e the&s;e are as <HI>truly</HI> the effects of divine goodne&s;s, as any known and acknowledged ble&s;&s;ings. You have had fathers of your fle&s;h, to whom you gave reverence when they cor|rected you: Should you not much rather give reverence, and be in &s;ubjection to the Father of your &s;pirits, under his correcting hand, that you may live? They, po&s;&s;ibly, &s;ometimes corrected you after their own plea|&s;ure, to gratify a &s;udden, tran&s;ient re&s;entment, rather than with a truly parental kindne&s;s,
<PB N="230" REF="009440_0245_0F7544381BB89690">
that you might become the wi&s;er and happier thereby. But when God corrects his children, his offspring, it is always kindly meant for their profit; that they may be taught to fear and obey him; that they may become parta|kers of his holine&s;s, and made wi&s;e unto &s;al|vation.</P>
<P>HOW highly culpable will you then be, if you refu&s;e to "hear the rod and him that appointed it?"&mdash;if you de&s;pi&s;e, not only the goodne&s;s of God in the common pre&s;ervation and bounties of his providence, but in the corrective vi&s;itations of it; and will not learn righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;obriety thereby; but go on hardening your hearts again&s;t the fear of the Almighty! Let me clo&s;e this head of ex|hortation therefore, with the words of Solo|mon&mdash;<Q>He that being often reproved, har|deneth his neck, &s;hall &s;uddenly be de&s;troy|ed, and that without remedy.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. XXIX. 1.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>V. IT is probable that mo&s;t, or all of you, in certain <HI>&s;ea&s;ons</HI> of <HI>danger</HI> and <HI>di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> when you apprehended death was not far from you, have had your con&s;ciences greatly alarmed. On the&s;e occa&s;ions your fooli&s;h and &s;inful cour&s;es have probably been brought to your remembrance, &s;o as to fill you with anxiety and guilty fears. At the&s;e times you have doubtle&s;s had your hearts and eyes turned to God, if you dared to look up to him, in im|portunate de&s;ires and prayers for mercy and pre&s;ervation; accompanied with &s;ecret <HI>pro|mi&s;es</HI>

and &s;olemn <HI>vows</HI> of amendment, and of devoting your&s;elves to the &s;ervice of God, if you might be &s;pared a while longer. I be|lieve there are, comparatively, but few per|&s;ons, old or young, e&s;pecially among&s;t tho&s;e who have been religiou&s;ly educated, but what have had experience of &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons of di&s;tre&s;s, awakening and fear; and of &s;uch workings of con&s;cience, &s;uch vows and good re&s;olu|tions at tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>FOR example: People are generally thus alarmed in times of contagious and mortal &s;ickne&s;s; when they &s;ee their friends and ac|quaintance carried away "as with a flood," and e&s;pecially when they them&s;elves are, by &s;ickne&s;s, brought "nigh unto death." Such reflections as the above-mentioned, are u&s;u|ally awakened in vicious per&s;ons, on the&s;e occa&s;ions. They that are, by their office, called often to the beds of the &s;ick, as their advi&s;ers and comforters, have frequent oppor|tunities, without being <HI>inqui&s;itive,</HI> to be in|formed of their true &s;entiments in the&s;e &s;erious hours. And the &s;entiments u&s;ually expre&s;&s;ed at &s;uch times by wicked men, and not un|commonly even by the good, corre&s;pond to tho&s;e words of the p&s;almi&s;t in his &s;ickne&s;s:&mdash;<Q>Surely, every man is vanity.&mdash;Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my cry, hold not thy peace from my tears&mdash;O &s;pare me, that I may recover &s;trength, before I go hence, and be no more.</Q> They al&s;o that go down to the &s;ea in &s;hips, that do bu|&s;ine&s;s

on the mighty waters, and are acquain|ted with the perils attending that way of life, know the fears and di&s;tre&s;&s;es often occa&s;ioned thereby. They are de&s;cribed in one of the p&s;alms, thus&mdash;"The Lord commandeth, and rai&s;eth up the &s;tormy wind, which lifteth up the waves&mdash;They mount up to the heavens, they go down to the depths; their &s;oul is melted becau&s;e of trouble&mdash;and they are at their wit's end.

Earthquakes are almo&s;t univer&s;al|ly terrifying; and we all in general know the &s;entiments of people on the&s;e occa&s;ions, by repeated ob&s;ervation and experience. There are al&s;o the dangers of war; and many others, which are common in the cour&s;e of human life. On all which occa&s;ions, the generality of people are in a degree of perturbation and fear; imploring the divine pre&s;ervation, and making &s;uch-like promi&s;es and re&s;olutions as have been mentioned.</P>
<P>NOW, let me a&s;k you &s;everal &s;erious que&s;|tions, my young brethren, relative to the&s;e times of danger, fear and anxiety. In the fir&s;t place then, have you not had experience of &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons your&s;elves?&mdash;if not of all, yet at lea&s;t of &s;ome of them? And were not your

&s;entiments on the&s;e occa&s;ions, &s;uch in gener|al as have been mentioned? Were not your con&s;ciences troubled within you? Did you not greatly fear death, and the con&s;equences of it? Did you not, at lea&s;t &s;ilently, implore God's &s;paring mercy, with vows of eternal gratitude and obedience to him? Taking this for granted, let me a&s;k again; Mu&s;t you not even now acknowledge, that tho&s;e were rea|&s;onable reflexions; and that, in general, you had ju&s;t cau&s;e for them? Were they not the re&s;ult, the dictates of nature, and of &s;ound rea&s;on, tho' not the effect of long premedita|tion? Or do you now con&s;ider them all as weak, childi&s;h fancies, and &s;uper&s;titious ima|ginations? You cannot think them &s;o, unle&s;s you &s;uppo&s;e that all thoughts of God, religion, virtue and vice, and of future rewards and puni&s;hments, are al&s;o childi&s;h, &s;uper&s;titious fancies. I have too good an opinion of you, to &s;u&s;pect the latter; and mu&s;t therefore conclude, that you &s;uppo&s;e you had &s;ome proper ground for &s;uch apprehen&s;ions as tho&s;e mentioned. Let me then a&s;k you again, Whether God was not kind and gracious to you, in hearing your cries at tho&s;e times, and &s;aving you from the&s;e dangers? Have not ma|ny of you rea&s;on to think, that if you had then been taken out of this world, according to your fears, you would now have been mi&s;erable in another? And do you not think, that you ought forever to bear in remem|brance, both tho&s;e perils, and the&s;e mercies

and deliverances; together with your vows and good re&s;olutions, &s;o as to fulfil them, by living &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the world? If you &s;hould forget or break the&s;e promi&s;es and vows, or continue to live unmindful of God and your duty, would not this be a great aggravation of your guilt? Or, tho' you &s;hould be thus forgetful and ungrate|ful; yet do you not &s;uppo&s;e that God re|members the&s;e things, to call you to an ac|count another day? And if he &s;hould do &s;o, what excu&s;e, what apology, what tolerable plea could you make for your&s;elves?</P>
<P>THESE, my young brethren, are indeed &s;erious que&s;tions; but they are not &s;uper&s;ti|tious or fanciful ones: Neither can they be thought &s;o by any, excepting tho&s;e who are &s;o hardened in infidelity and vice, as to con|ceit that every thing which is grave and &s;eri|ous, or which &s;uppo&s;es the truth of religion, ought to be di&s;carded under the name of &s;uper&s;tition&mdash;Know then, that your vows and promi&s;es are upon record in heaven!

<P>VI. THE <HI>peace</HI> of <HI>your own minds,</HI> which is far more de&s;irable than any earthly enjoy|ments, e&s;&s;entially depends upon the &s;obriety of them; or, in other words, it depends up|on your being truly wi&s;e and virtuous, and living &s;uch an holy, rea&s;onable life as I am recommending to you. There is no other life agreeable to the &s;uperior, and mo&s;t ex|cellent

part of human nature; none that yields &s;uch &s;olid &s;atisfaction to the <HI>mind,</HI>&mdash;the principal, the only &s;eat of <HI>rational happine&s;s.</HI> Any other kind of life, i. e. any &s;inful, pro|fligate one, mu&s;t be unhappy, becau&s;e irra|tional; becau&s;e it is contrary to the light and dictates of the mind, or to natural con&s;cience. Pride, envy, malice, covetou&s;ne&s;s, and all o|ther vicious pa&s;&s;ions, are in their own nature de&s;tructive of human felicity: They at once pollute, poi&s;on and torment the &s;oul. And be&s;ides: No man, unle&s;s you &s;uppo&s;e him a right down athei&s;t, &s;uch an one as is hardly to be found in the world, or a per&s;on quite &s;tupified and abandoned, can lead an impious, vicious life, without being &s;elf-condemned;&mdash;without having his own rea&s;on and con&s;cience again&s;t him, and being, &s;ometimes at lea&s;t, under apprehen&s;ions of the ju&s;t and awful di&s;|plea&s;ure of the Almighty. All men in general, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that have been educated in the belief of the chri&s;tian revelation, have their &s;erious hours;&mdash;their times of reflexion, in which they cannot, if they would, avoid thinking of God and their own ways; of their duty, and what the habitual violation of it mu&s;t terminate in at la&s;t. No man can live always in a frolick; or in &s;uch an uninter|rupted cour&s;e, either of worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, or of plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements, that grave and &s;erious thoughts will not at times force them|&s;elves upon him. And whenever they do &s;o, then the wicked man knows, and feels him&s;elf
<PB N="237" REF="009440_0252_0F748FB039690198">
to be, what he actually is, a wretch; a &s;elf-accu&s;ed, &s;elf-condemned criminal, pre&s;aging in his con&s;cience, a light which "lighteneth every man that cometh into the world," his future condemnation at an higher tribunal. So that even in the mid&s;t of jollity, laughter and criminal indulgences, the heart of &s;uch men is often &s;orrowful, whether you a &s;ee &s;ud|den gloom appearing upon their faces, or not. How wretched are they then, at other times!</P>
<P>CONSIDER then, the unhappy &s;tate of &s;uch a man; of One, who&s;e only refuge from con&s;cious &s;hame and di&s;honor, from guilty fears and anxiety, is in bu&s;ine&s;s, diver&s;ions or &s;leep;&mdash;in flying from thought, in flying as it were from him&s;elf! Which yet he cannot always do &s;o effectually, but that trouble will pur&s;ue him from bu&s;ine&s;s to the banquet, to places of riot and guilty plea&s;ure: Nor will it leave even his &s;leep unmole&s;ted. For when he &s;aith, "My bed &s;hall comfort me, my couch &s;hall ea&s;e my complaint;" then he is "&s;cared with dreams, and terrified with vi&s;ions."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job. Chap. VII.</NOTE> But con&s;ider, more e&s;pecially, the mi&s;erable condition of &s;uch a man in times of adver&s;ity and danger; &s;uch as were &s;poken of under the preceding head: When he is forced more directly upon &s;erious reflexions on life and death, on another world, and a judgment to come. Where is then his refuge, his &s;upport, his confidence and "&s;trong tower"? At the&s;e times he can no longer
<PB N="238" REF="009440_0253_0F748FB115317210">
cheat and delude him&s;elf by bu&s;ine&s;s or diver&s;ions, into an imaginary happine&s;s: The fool's paradi&s;e then vani&s;heth quite away. Shall he therefore, when he is no longer per|mitted to enjoy this, con&s;ole him&s;elf with the thoughts of God and his providence; and, "in the multitude of his thoughts within him," have his "&s;oul delighted with the&s;e divine comforts"? Alas! the&s;e reflexions are com|monly the mo&s;t di&s;piriting, the mo&s;t gloomy and tormenting of any, to a wicked man in adver&s;ity; they are them&s;elves the principal &s;ource of his di&s;tre&s;s. So that putting wicked men upon &s;uch a method to get comfort, is much like comforting a &s;elf-condemned male|factor in pri&s;on, by reminding him of his approaching trial, and the equity of his judge! When Paul preached of righteou&s;ne&s;s, tempe|rance and judgment to come, the guilty Faelix, even in the height of his pro&s;perity and glory, trembled on his tribunal before his poor pri|&s;oner. This &s;hews the great power of natu|ral con&s;cience; and, how truly wretched and mi&s;erable tho&s;e per&s;ons are, who live in the practice of known &s;in and vice, whatever pains they may take, and how artful &s;oever they may be to di&s;gui&s;e it. So that the&s;e ob|&s;ervations of the prophet, are founded in na|ture and experience, and are maxims of eter|nal truth&mdash;<Q>The wicked are like the troubled &s;ea, when it cannot re&s;t, who&s;e waters ca&s;t up mire and dirt. There is no peace, &s;aith my God, to the wicked!</Q></P>

CONSIDER now, on the other hand, the inward peace and happine&s;s, which naturally attend &s;obriety, or the belief and practice of true religion, according to the "glorious go&s;|pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God." A &s;incere chri&s;tian's rea&s;on and con&s;cience are his friends and ad|vocates; approving and ju&s;tifying his general cour&s;e of life to him&s;elf. He has the te&s;timo|ny of a good con&s;cience; and the con&s;e|quence hereof is, that he con&s;iders God him|&s;elf as his friend. For "if our own heart condemn us not," &s;ays the apo&s;tle John, "then have we confidence towards God." And the apo&s;tle Paul, "Our rejoicing is this, the te&s;timony of our con&s;cience, that in &s;im|plicity and godly &s;incerity, not with fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conver&s;ation in the world." The &s;incere believer, or real chri&s;tian, has "&s;trong con&s;olation," even "all joy and peace in be|lieving." His hopes, like the wi&s;e man's hou&s;e, are founded upon a rock, the "rock of ages;" and will not be <HI>beaten down</HI> by all the rains and floods, the winds and &s;torms of adver&s;ity; tho' they may &s;ometimes be <HI>&s;haken.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH hope in God, as is the natural con|&s;equence of a &s;ober mind re&s;ting it&s;elf on the divine promi&s;es; or, of pure and undefiled religion: Such hope in God, I &s;ay, at once heightens all the joyful &s;cenes and occurents of human life, and brightens every gloomy one.

regard: I mean, all truly wi&s;e and good men; all who are of a &s;ound mind them&s;elves. "The righteous is more excellent," and therefore more honourable al&s;o, "than his [unrighteous] neigh|bour:" He is &s;o in rea&s;on and nature; he is &s;o likewi&s;e in the e&s;timation of all rea&s;onable and good men.

<P>THIS is not, indeed, an argument of &s;o great weight, as tho&s;e which have been mentioned before, and as others which are to be mentioned hereafter: And people, as is well known, may be far too de&s;irous of "that honor that cometh from men." But yet this is in it&s;elf a rational motive, and often u&s;ed as &s;uch in the holy &s;crip|tures. You ought, doubtle&s;s, to have &s;ome concern for your reputation among&s;t men, tho' always in &s;ubordination to the "honor that cometh from God." For "a good name is better than precious ointment." This is of real importance to all men in general, and particular|ly to young men ju&s;t &s;etting out in the world. Their pre&s;ent intere&s;t depends very much, and &s;ometimes chiefly, upon their character. A young man who has no &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, or no regard for his own honor and reputation, is in a fair way, not only for univer&s;al contempt, but ruin. And, as was &s;aid before, &s;obriety of mind and manners is, according to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed cour&s;e of things, the mo&s;t effectual means of &s;ecuring a good name among&s;t men.</P>

BUT you will &s;ay, perhaps, "However excel|lent a thing religion may be in it&s;elf; however worthy of honor, and how much &s;oever &s;ome per&s;ons may extol it; yet the greater part of mankind, and tho&s;e with whom One mu&s;t be chiefly concerned, are fooli&s;h and vicious. They do not e&s;teem a per&s;on the more, &s;ome of them the le&s;s, on account of his &s;obriety. Many will rather ridicule and &s;coff at him, than honor, &s;peak well of or befriend him, for his religion and virtue." To &s;trengthen your objection again&s;t my pre&s;ent argument, you may po&s;&s;ibly add, "That even &s;ome kings, governors and governments, after i&s;&s;uing proclamations for the encouragement of piety and virtue, with a&s;&s;urances of &s;hewing the mo&s;t countenance, and giving the preference to tho&s;e per&s;ons, who &s;hould be found to practi&s;e them; and of di&s;|countenancing tho&s;e of a contrary character, have, in many in&s;tances, notoriou&s;ly di&s;appointed the public expectation by a contrary conduct; by courting, care&s;&s;ing and preferring the mo&s;t vicious, worthle&s;s and &s;ordid, and frowning up|on, or at be&s;t neglecting, men of known virtue and &s;obriety."</P>
<P>THIS is a pretty heavy charge upon the world: But as it naturally occurs by way of objection to what was before a&s;&s;erted, I &s;hall con&s;ider, and endeavour to invalidate it, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with truth and ju&s;tice, or, without "&s;peaking wickedly for God." The following ob&s;ervations, I imagine, will &s;hew that this objection has much le&s;s weight in it than you
<PB N="244" REF="009440_0259_0F748FB58EC5BD00">
may think; and leaves my argument all the force that it was &s;uppo&s;ed to have.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT mu&s;t be allowed that piety and virtue are far from being honoured &s;o much in the world, as they ought in rea&s;on to be. But put the matter upon the wor&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition that can be made:&mdash;Suppo&s;e that tho&s;e who honor reli|gion in their hearts, or think the better of the virtuous and &s;ober for being &s;o, are very few in compari&s;on of tho&s;e who inwardly de&s;pi&s;e both: Yet, upon this mo&s;t unfavourable &s;uppo&s;ition, let me a&s;k, Which is the mo&s;t to be de&s;ired, the ap|probation and e&s;teem of the <HI>few wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>know|ing,</HI> who judge of things according to nature, truth and propriety; or that of a va&s;t <HI>multitude</HI> of <HI>fools</HI> and <HI>madmen,</HI> who are really ignorant what true worth, excellency and honor con&s;i&s;t in? If you were painters, &s;tatuaries or architects; if you were poets, mu&s;icians or orators; and not riches, but reputation was your principal end, would you not be ambitious of plea&s;ing the be&s;t judges, the greate&s;t ma&s;ters in the&s;e noble arts, rather than va&s;t ignorant multitudes, who had neither &s;kill, ta&s;te nor judgment in them? And &s;o in all other arts and profe&s;&s;ions, if you had a view to reputation only, not gain? Doubtle&s;s you would. The application of this to the point in hand, is ea&s;y. If there were but three, two, nay, but one wi&s;e and good man in the world; but one who di&s;tingui&s;hed rightly betwixt per|&s;ons or characters, and honoured virtue and &s;o|briety, you ought in rea&s;on to covet the appro|bation and e&s;teem of that one man, more than
<PB N="245" REF="009440_0260_0F748FB66E00D718">
that of the whole ignorant and wicked world be|&s;ide: E&s;pecially when you reflect, that his judg|ment is ratified in heaven, by Him that has &s;aid, <Q>Them that honor me, I will honor; and they that de&s;pi&s;e me &s;hall be lightly e&s;teemed.</Q> But,</P>
<P N="2">2. THE &s;uppo&s;ition here made, is very injuri|ous to the world. For there are great numbers of people in all chri&s;tian and prote&s;tant countries, and particularly in our own, who are &s;incere lovers of virtue and religion; and who accord|ingly e&s;teem tho&s;e that practi&s;e them, far more than they do the vicious, profane and di&s;&s;olute. The proportion which the good bear to others, in point of number, cannot be determined: But, that it is very con&s;iderable, cannot be denied without great uncharitablene&s;s. And if you are &s;ober-minded, you may depend upon the e&s;teem of the&s;e in general, &s;o far as you and your cha|racters are known to them. All the truly virtu|ous and good, e&s;teem and honor per&s;ons of the &s;ame character, as &s;uch. And whenever it &s;eems to be otherwi&s;e, it is becau&s;e they <HI>do not know them</HI> to be &s;uch; but are under a mi&s;take as to their character, either becau&s;e of &s;ome particular opinions which they may hold, that are &s;uppo&s;ed to be incon&s;i&s;tent with piety, or on &s;ome other account. But the&s;e ca&s;es being excepted, which are very rare among&s;t the truly wi&s;e and &s;ober; all good men in general actually love and honor one another. If they ever di&s;like each other, it is not, con&s;idered under their real characters as virtuous and pious, but their <HI>mi&s;taken</HI> characters as vicious or impious, that they do &s;o.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="246" REF="009440_0261_0F748FB6F4801FE0">
3. THERE are many more people who honor virtue in others, than practi&s;e it them&s;elves. By what I have read and ob&s;erved, there is a very general regard paid to religion and virtue, even by vicious men. There is a witne&s;s for God and religion in the brea&s;ts of very wicked per&s;ons; which cau&s;es them, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to e&s;teem and reverence that virtue in others, which they have not the re&s;olution and integrity to practi&s;e. Be&s;ides: Their own intere&s;t, which, you may be|&s;ure they love and regard, naturally leads them, &s;ome particular ca&s;es being excepted, to form connexions, at lea&s;t in affairs of commerce and bu&s;ine&s;s, with the &s;ober, hone&s;t and virtuous, who, they know, will not wrong and deceive them; rather than with per&s;ons of openly profli|gate, or &s;u&s;pected morals. Even knaves cannot ordinarily tru&s;t knaves with their intere&s;t; but they can and do, much oftener and more freely, tru&s;t men of approved virtue and integrity with it. When good men are de&s;pi&s;ed or di&s;liked by the bad, it is generally, if not always owing to one or other of the cau&s;es following. Some good men are, perhaps, of unpopular &s;entiments in religion; and hypocritical zealots for the e&s;tabli&s;hed orthodoxy in any country, may di&s;like them <HI>merely</HI> on that account. Other good men may have a tincture of &s;uper&s;tition, enthu&s;ia&s;m or &s;ourne&s;s; or they may have &s;ome per&s;onal oddities, &s;ingularities, or an uncouth behaviour; &s;ome di&s;agreeable appendages of their religion, or &s;ome natural imperfections attending them in a degree that is not common. Either of the&s;e
<PB N="247" REF="009440_0262_0F748FB868AB7BD8">
things may create a di&s;like, and kind of aver&s;ion to them, even in the minds of tho&s;e, who at the &s;ame time cannot but e&s;teem them, con&s;idered as men of &s;incere piety and virtue, or &s;tripped of tho&s;e blemi&s;hes and imperfections. It mu&s;t far|ther be allowed, that bad men, whether in <HI>high</HI> or <HI>low</HI> &s;tations, may occa&s;ionally have an aver|&s;ion to the wi&s;e and hone&s;t, con&s;idered as &s;tanding in oppo&s;ition to their unrighteous, am|bitious and avaritious de&s;igns. In which ca&s;es, however, it is more properly &s;aid, that they have an inordinate and criminal love to their intere&s;t, or to power and worldly honors, than that they have any real di&s;like to tho&s;e good men, con&s;i|dered as &s;uch: For they rather e&s;teem them in their hearts, even while they would be glad to have them out of their way. Thus al&s;o bad men, whether of <HI>high</HI> or <HI>low</HI> degree, may occa|&s;ionally have &s;ome <HI>dirty jobs,</HI> and <HI>wicked work</HI> to do, in which none will &s;erve them, except <HI>dirty, lying,</HI> "leud fellows of the ba&s;er &s;ort;" whom they care&s;s for that very end, while they frown upon, and keep at a di&s;tance from, hone&s;t men: Not becau&s;e they inwardly e&s;teem the former, or di&s;like the latter, as &s;uch. For tho&s;e they &s;till de&s;pi&s;e, while they employ them in <HI>&s;uch work,</HI> and the&s;e they honor in their hearts, tho' they will not <HI>do,</HI> but rather <HI>ob&s;truct it.</HI> As pro|fane and vicious as the world is, there are in fact but very few, if any per&s;ons in it, &s;o abandoned as to hate or de&s;pi&s;e a good and virtuous man, only for being &s;o; nay, as not to have an in|ward e&s;teem for him, and a &s;ecret contempt for
<PB N="248" REF="009440_0263_0F748FB8740A9DD8">
tho&s;e that are of profligate principles and morals: So that if you are truly pious and virtuous; e&s;|pecially if your religion is open and manly, free from &s;uper&s;tition, &s;ourne&s;s and enthu&s;ia&s;m, and from any great &s;ingularities and oddities, you may depend, not only upon the re&s;pect and e&s;teem of all the wi&s;e and virtuous in general, but al&s;o upon that of the fooli&s;h and vicious, with a very few exceptions, Whereas, on the other hand, if you are vicious and profligate, you may be a&s;&s;ured that you will be &s;ecretly de&s;pi&s;ed, not only by the good, but even by the generality of the wicked them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4">4. AS to what was &s;aid in the objection, about men of bad morals being countenanced in &s;ome countries, while the virtuous and good have been neglected, after public <HI>edicts</HI> or <HI>proclamations</HI> which gave rea&s;on to expect the contrary; this is ea&s;ily to be accounted for upon the principles laid down above&mdash;Either the true characters of the&s;e per&s;ons re&s;pectively, were not known; or el&s;e the promoters of the former, and neglecters of the latter, had &s;ome particular &s;ini&s;ter and di&s;|honourable <HI>ends</HI> to an&s;wer by &s;uch a conduct; which has doubtle&s;s &s;ometimes been the ca&s;e&mdash;But, by the way, there cannot be a clearer te&s;ti|mony given to the e&s;teem and honor that are ac|tually due to religion, in the opinion of the world, or of that dis-approbation and contempt which are due to vice, than &s;uch public acts, edicts or proclamations for the encouragement of the former, and for di&s;countenancing the latter; how often &s;oever the world has been deceived in
<PB N="249" REF="009440_0264_0F748FB9363B7FC8">
pa&s;t ages, by the honourable, excellent and royal AUTHORS of them&mdash;Tho' in all governments, other circum&s;tances being alike, tho&s;e per&s;ons who were <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to be the <HI>wi&s;e&s;t</HI> and <HI>be&s;t,</HI> have in general actually had the preference given them, in all ages.</P>
<P N="5">5. ANOTHER undeniable proof of the gene|ral e&s;teem there is in the world for virtue and re|ligion, is <HI>hypocri&s;y.</HI> How many per&s;ons, tho' wholly de&s;titute of the reality, "the power," yet put on the "form of godline&s;s," merely for the &s;ake of their credit and reputation in the world? If an homely bird decks her&s;elf out in the rich plumage of the peacock, it is doubtle&s;s in order to make a better appearance in the eyes of &s;pec|tators, than &s;he could in her own&mdash;Wicked men know, that if they appear in their own proper colours, they mu&s;t be contemned, if not &s;hunned and dete&s;ted by mo&s;t people; even by tho&s;e that are in the &s;ame "cage of unclean and hateful birds"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. XVIII. 2.</NOTE> with them. They therefore di&s;&s;em|ble, turn impo&s;tors, and adorn them&s;elves, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, with the feathers, and more re&s;pectable plumage of religious, hone&s;t men; that they may enjoy at once the reputation of religion, and the imaginary gains and advantages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. There would be no occa|&s;ion for hypocri&s;y, and therefore no hypocrites, if wicked and profligate men were generally as much e&s;teemed and honoured as the good; any more than there would be counterfeit coin, if there were none genuine, that was commonly valued, and that pa&s;&s;ed current in the world. So
<PB N="250" REF="009440_0265_0F748FBA00DC0FF0">
that hypocri&s;y it&s;elf, that odious &s;in, is, in &s;ome &s;ort a &s;tanding witne&s;s for God and religion, in all ages and countries; as well as a proof of the general e&s;teem there is for virtue, how little &s;oever there may be of the practice. It is a tacit confe&s;&s;ion of the &s;uperior excellency and honor of true religion; and that vice cannot well keep it&s;elf in countenance, even in this wicked world, without putting on &s;ome appear|ance of virtue. And if vice avails her&s;elf thus of the credit of religion; yet &s;he does homage to her for it, tho' unwillingly. For hypocri&s;y is a kind of tribute which the former, with an awkward and &s;hameful reluctance, pays to the lat|ter, her acknowledged &s;uperior, from one gene|ration to another, in all ages and all nations.</P>
<P N="6">6. WHY do you, my young brethren&mdash;?&mdash;No, I will not &s;ay, <HI>You</HI>&mdash;But, why do the vicious and profligate chu&s;e &s;ecre&s;y and darkne&s;s, as the fitte&s;t occa&s;ions for perpetrating their crimes? Why are they that are drunken, u&s;ually "drunk|en in the night," rather than in the day? Why does "the eye of the adulterer wait for the twi|light?" Why does that of the thief and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in commonly do the &s;ame? In a word, why do vicious men in general chu&s;e to &s;in in &s;ecret, ra|ther than openly; and, as far as may be, to con|ceal their vices from the world, unle&s;s it is, be|cau&s;e they know the world in general di&s;likes vice, and e&s;teems virtue; if not practically, yet in opinion?</P>
<P N="7">7. DID you ever know any per&s;on that was addicted to &s;lander and defamation, pretend to
<PB N="251" REF="009440_0266_0F748FBAF6FCEF50">
reproach another, by <HI>accu&s;ing</HI> him of loving or fearing God;&mdash;of honouring Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and keeping his commandments;&mdash;of ob&s;erving his own promi&s;es, and &s;peaking nothing but truth;&mdash;of loving his neighbour as him&s;elf, and of being hone&s;t, &s;ober and virtuous in his whole conver&s;ation?&mdash;They that deal in defamation, under&s;tand their wicked art, and the &s;entiments of the world, much better than to &s;ay the&s;e things of any One by way of reproach; which they know would be the highe&s;t prai&s;e and commendation.</P>
<P N="8">8. TO put this matter at once in the faire&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t light, let me a&s;k you the following que&s;tion&mdash;Suppo&s;e you had &s;ome mortal enemy, whom you would be glad to ruin; and particu|larly, whom you de&s;ired to &s;ee de&s;pi&s;ed and de|te&s;ted by mankind in general; which do you think would contribute the mo&s;t effectually to this end,&mdash;to repre&s;ent him as a wicked and im|pious, a vicious, faithle&s;s, debauched and profli|gate per&s;on;&mdash;One that neither feared God, nor regarded man: Or, as One that was truly pious and &s;ober, upright and virtuous;&mdash;in a word, a &s;incere chri&s;tian both in principle and practice? If you were determined to hurt your enemy's re|putation as much as you could; if you were un|der no checks or re&s;traints of con&s;cience, and if you were &s;ure to be believed by the world, in whatever you &s;aid of him, which of the&s;e two very oppo&s;ite characters would you give the hated per&s;on?&mdash;You can be at no lo&s;s for an an&s;wer to &s;o plain a que&s;tion: And that very an&s;wer, which
<PB N="252" REF="009440_0267_0F748FBB72370E88">
you have <HI>now</HI> in your minds, &s;hews that you are &s;en&s;ible, the world in general e&s;teems virtuous and religious men, and contemns and abhors tho&s;e that are profligately wicked. You know that even the bad in general, much prefer, in their judgment and e&s;teem, the former to the latter: Tho' even the good are often under a kind of nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>keeping in,</HI> having clo&s;e <HI>connexions</HI> with, and <HI>courting</HI> the vicious;&mdash;&s;ometimes, perhaps, for valuable public ends; but pro|bably oftener, for private advantage, or for fear of <HI>mi&s;chief</HI> from &s;uch per&s;ons; as our American Indians are &s;aid formerly to have wor&s;hipped the <HI>devil.</HI> An unhappy &s;ituation! How are they to be pitied, who have &s;ome real love to virtue; and yet are obliged, as it were, to care&s;s the profligate, on account of their riches, power, and that influence which they often have in the affairs of this fooli&s;h, corrupt and wicked world?&mdash;</P>
<P>I CANNOT but make this one &s;hort reflexion on the foregoing ob&s;ervations, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That from them it plainly appears, that vicious men, more e&s;pecially under the light of the go&s;pel, are all in general <HI>&s;elf-condemned;</HI> ina&s;much as they can|not but acknowledge and approve the right, in their own judgment and con&s;ciences, as honour|able and prai&s;e-worthy; and yet habitually do the wrong, from an evil propen&s;ity in their na|tures. To allude to the words of the apo&s;tle, they con&s;ent to the law of God, that is holy, ju&s;t, good and &s;piritual; but &s;till them&s;elves are "carnal, &s;old under &s;in," as bond-&s;ervants and <HI>&s;laves</HI> to it; who&s;e tyrannical dictates they obey,
<PB N="253" REF="009440_0268_0F748FBD33972F10">
contrary to the light and law of the mind. For that which they do, they allow not; neither do they do that good, to which they have &s;ome faint de&s;ire; but what they do in a &s;ort hate, that they practi&s;e&mdash;O wretched, that they are! Who, or what &s;hall deliver them from the body of this death, but "the law of the Spirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us?"</P>
<P>LET me exhort you, my young brethren, du|ly to con&s;ider tho&s;e motives to true religion, which have been mentioned in this di&s;cour&s;e. Whatever your corrupt pa&s;&s;ions may have to object, I know that I have a powerful party on my &s;ide in your brea&s;ts and bo&s;oms; I mean your own con&s;cience, your own rea&s;on. To that, and to God, the &s;ource of all rea&s;on, light, truth and ju&s;tice, I have &s;urely a right to make an appeal from the partial, bribed, blind judgment of pa&s;&s;ion, and carnal affections. I accordingly lodge my appeal there, with them: And you mu&s;t, whether you will or no, an&s;wer, and give an account of your&s;elves, at both tho&s;e tribunals;&mdash;unle&s;s you &s;hould give up the cau&s;e by con&s;enting, as you are exhorted, "to be &s;o|ber-minded."</P>
<P>LET me ju&s;t add, with reference to the la&s;t-mentioned argument, as to your reputation in the world; that this will very much depend up|on your behaviour in youth. The character is mo&s;t commonly formed and e&s;tabli&s;hed in that &s;ea&s;on of life, either as good or bad: And which|ever of them it is, it will be of no &s;mall con&s;e|quence to you in this world, while you are in|habitants
<PB N="254" REF="009440_0269_0F748FBE756A5CB8">
of it. A bad name is often of fatal con&s;equence to a young man ju&s;t &s;etting out in the world, as to his intere&s;t therein. On the other hand, <Q>a good name is rather to be cho&s;en than great riches, and loving-favor, than &s;ilver and gold.</Q> A good character pre&s;erves old, and creates new friends; it is at once agreeable and advantageous in many re&s;pects. Allow me then, as One &s;incerely concerned for your temporal, as well as eternal good, to exhort you &s;ea&s;onably to take care of your reputation and honor, by a di&s;crete, &s;ober and virtuous behaviour. And if any of you have unhappily, by former mi&s;car|riages, brought di&s;grace upon your&s;elves; lo&s;e no time, but immediately endeavour to retrieve your characters, by making it manife&s;t that you have &s;een your errors, and are reformed.</P>
<P>THE world is candid enough to make &s;ome con&s;iderable allowances for the errors of young men, if they are not ob&s;tinate in, but &s;peedily reform them. In this ca&s;e, their unexperienced, tender age is a powerful advocate for them: It pleads &s;o eloquently in their behalf, that it never fails to excite compa&s;&s;ion, and to obtain a par|don for them from the world. And, what is of infinitely more importance to you, if you &s;in|cerely repent of, and for&s;ake your evil ways, God will not remember them again&s;t you: He will not be always wroth, neither will he keep his anger forever. "If the wicked will turn from all his &s;ins that he hath committed&mdash;and do that which is lawful and right, he &s;hall &s;urely live; he &s;hall not die. All his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions that

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MY young brethren, in the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e you were exhorted to be &s;o|ber-minded, by divers con&s;iderations and motives, which need not now be mentioned. I &s;hall therefore, without any repetition, proceed in this exhortation, by laying before you &s;ome other arguments; all, of real, tho' not of equal

weight: Hoping that, for your own &s;akes, you will give &s;uch an attention to them, as they may rea&s;onably demand. Wherefore,</P>
<P>VIII. TO be &s;ober-minded will be mo&s;t for your <HI>advantage</HI> in <HI>this world;</HI> mo&s;t for the health of your bodies, and for your outward pro&s;perity in all other re&s;pects. How this tends to the peace and comfort of your minds, and al&s;o to your reputation in the world, was &s;hewn in the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e. And it may an&s;wer a valuable end, if I can now make it appear to you, that your temporal felicity in other re&s;pects, very much depends upon your being truly religious. Tho' this is not an argument of the greate&s;t weight; yet it is of con&s;iderable importance, as it may remove &s;ome prejudices again&s;t religion, ari|&s;ing from a fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;ition, that it is preju|dicial to your worldly felicity. And I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t the longer upon this argument, becau&s;e, as I apprehend, it is not &s;o frequently and particularly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the pulpit, as might be for the credit, and thereby for the intere&s;t of religion.</P>
<P>BUT you will ob&s;erve, that when I &s;peak of it as being for your intere&s;t to be &s;ober-minded, in conformity to the principles and precepts of chri&s;tianity, I &s;peak with particu|lar reference to the age and country in which you live; wherein this religion is publicly countenanced, and generally profe&s;&s;ed. For, no regard being had to the&s;e circum&s;tances, it is &s;uppo&s;eable that the belief, profe&s;&s;ion and
<PB N="258" REF="009440_0273_0F748FC29D83B1D0">
practice of the chri&s;tian religion, might be very detrimental to a per&s;on's credit and worldly intere&s;t, in that &s;en&s;e of them which is here intended. If you lived in an age and country, wherein the name of Chri&s;t was ge|nerally odious, his religion not publicly tole|rated, and his di&s;ciples, as &s;uch, reproached, per&s;ecuted, &s;ubjected to the confi&s;cation of goods, to bonds and impri&s;onment; or even, wherein they were not allowed the privileges and liberties common to other &s;ubjects; up|on this &s;uppo&s;ition, I &s;ay, your godly and chri&s;tian &s;obriety would manife&s;tly tend to hurt your reputation and intere&s;t, in&s;tead of promoting them. This was the condition, this the &s;ituation, the&s;e the circum&s;tances of chri&s;tians, for about three hundred years after Chri&s;t; till the days of the Emperor Con|&s;tantine the Great. The public voice con|demned them as an odious, impious &s;ect; the laws were again&s;t them; their enemies were inveterate, and had all the power in their hands. The con&s;equence was, that they were denied the common privileges of men; and "who&s;oever would live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;uffered per&s;ecution" in one or other, and &s;ometimes many of its hateful forms. Chri&s;tians, in tho&s;e &s;ad times, be&s;ides being reproached for the name of Chri&s;t, were often called to &s;uffer the lo&s;s of all things; they were haled before kings, governors and other magi&s;trates; they were impri&s;oned, thrown into dungeons, &s;toned, impaled, crucified,
<PB N="259" REF="009440_0274_0F748FC3824665C0">
&s;lain with the &s;word, &s;awn in &s;under; and forced to &s;uffer unnumber'd indignities and tortures, merely as chri&s;tians; not accept|ing deliverance, on the condition of renoun|cing the faith, and bla&s;pheming the name of Chri&s;t "that they might obtain a better re&s;ur|rection." And though the per&s;ecution did not rage again&s;t them in the &s;ame degree of fury, during the long period before-mention|ed; yet in any part thereof, it was apparent|ly contrary to a man's worldly reputation and intere&s;t, to be a chri&s;tian: As it may be even at this day, in countries where the laws and people in general, are again&s;t the religion and di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t; and as it may be for prote&s;tants in roman-catholic countries, or any others called chri&s;tian, where there is not a general toleration.</P>
<P>BUT with re&s;pect to our&s;elves, and to this happy country of liberty, the ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e. Chri&s;tianity is commonly profe&s;|&s;ed; the laws countenance and &s;upport it; the government is in the hands of chri&s;tians, and chri&s;tians enjoy &s;ome privileges which others do not. There is here a general liber|ty and toleration for all to wor&s;hip God ac|cording to their con&s;ciences (not a little griev|ous to &s;ome particular per&s;ons of dark, con|tracted and groveling minds.) And it is in general a very reputable thing among&s;t us, to be a pious, virtuous and good man. Now, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I &s;ay, and you may ea&s;ily perceive, it is mo&s;t for your
<PB N="260" REF="009440_0275_0F748FC45E68D9E0">
worldly intere&s;t to be &s;ober-minded; far more &s;o, in all re&s;pects, than it would be to be pro|fligate and impious. Let me more particu|larly ob&s;erve a few things here, in order to &s;et the pre&s;ent argument in a proper light.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. AS, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, virtue and religion will be a recommendation of you to the e&s;teem of people, it manife&s;tly tends to your intere&s;t in this re&s;pect; I mean, to what is commonly called worldly gain or profit. For people in general, good and bad, &s;ome few ca&s;es being excepted, would much rather tru&s;t, and have connexions in bu&s;ine&s;s with a &s;ober, hone&s;t man, of an e&s;tabli&s;hed good character, than with a vicious and profligate one, of a contrary character. And this evi|dently tends to a per&s;on's intere&s;t, whatever be his &s;tation or calling in life; e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered, that the wi&s;er and better part, and tho&s;e who ordinarily have it mo&s;t in their power to &s;erve and befriend you, will be more particularly di&s;po&s;ed to do &s;o, from real regard; while others, for their own in|tere&s;t, will rather employ, or have concerns with an hone&s;t main, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> than with one of no religion, or of bad morals.</P>
<P N="2">2. AS to public po&s;ts of honor or emolu|ment, for which &s;ome of you, perhaps, ei|ther do, or may in time &s;tand as candidates; it is to be hoped that, all other circum&s;tances being alike, your known integrity, and good behaviour in life, would be &s;ome recommen|dation
<PB N="261" REF="009440_0276_0F748FC49BC281A0">
of you, and procure a preference. Certainly it would, under any tolerably wi&s;e and good admini&s;tration of government; e&s;|pecially in tho&s;e governments which have a great mixture of the popular form, and in countries where there are no iniquitous <HI>te&s;ts;</HI> as in our own. Let me add, that if we have formerly, in certain in&s;tances, known per&s;ons of infamous characters preferred to magi&s;|tracies, or to other honourable and lucrative offices, to the neglect of virtue and merit; yet I &s;hould be extremely loth to &s;uppo&s;e that this is either now a <HI>common</HI> thing among&s;t us, or will be &s;o hereafter.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF we &s;uppo&s;e the providence of God governs the world, in the manner declared in the holy &s;criptures; tho&s;e who love and &s;erve him in &s;incerity, have much more rea|&s;on to expect his ble&s;&s;ing upon their hone&s;t de&s;igns and undertakings, in order to obtain a competency of the good things of this life, than impious and profligate men have, to hope for his ble&s;&s;ing upon their's; e&s;pecially upon &s;uch de&s;igns as are in their nature di&s;|hone&s;t and criminal. This is the lea&s;t that can be &s;aid with reference to what may be expected from divine providence, in the or|dinary cour&s;e of it, according to very nume|rous repre&s;entations in &s;cripture; which are rather confirmed than contradicted by expe|rience. Tho', as we do not certainly know the hearts of men, and may be deceived as to their characters; we mu&s;t needs be very in|adequate

judges, when the conduct of provi|dence is, or is not, &s;trictly agreeable to the&s;e repre&s;entations. And tho' there may be &s;ome exceptions here, as under other general rules; yet it is not improbable, that the&s;e may be much fewer in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, than is com|monly &s;uppo&s;ed. The examples of wicked men pro&s;pered in this world, are indeed very numerous, and indi&s;putable: For God is good to the unthankful and to the evil. But it is not, neither can it be, &s;o certain to us on the other hand, that the good are often for&s;aken, or left de&s;titute by him. And it is not unworthy of remark, that in that p&s;alm wherein the pro&s;perity of &s;ome wicked men, is &s;et forth more amply than in any other part of &s;cripture, the in&s;pired p&s;almi&s;t makes the following declaration, &s;o much to the honor of divine providence: <Q>The &s;teps of a good man are ordered by the Lord; and he de|lighteth in his way. Tho' he fall, he &s;hall not be utterly ca&s;t down: For the Lord upholdeth him with his hand. I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not &s;een the righteous for&s;aken, nor his &s;eed begging bread.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm XXXVII. 23, 24, 25.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. IT &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that many of tho&s;e virtues which belong to the head of chri&s;tian &s;obriety, have, in their very nature, a direct tendency to promote your temporal intere&s;t and happine&s;s. For example; dili|gence in your worldly callings, temperance
<PB N="263" REF="009440_0278_0F748FC5F87CFBB8">
in meat and drink, and a virtuous moderation in other re&s;pects, have a plain, direct tenden|cy to &s;ecure and advance your wealth, your health and ea&s;e; and to prolong your lives. In comformity whereto, Solomon &s;ays of wi&s;dom, that "length of days is in her right hand, and in her left, riches and honor."</P>
<P>On the other hand,</P>
<P N="5">5. MOST of tho&s;e vices and exce&s;&s;es, which are repugnant to &s;obriety, have as direct and apparent a tendency to prejudice your worldly intere&s;t and happine&s;s. For is not this evi|dently true of idlene&s;s, intemperance, pride and luxury&mdash;of wa&s;ting your time, and &s;quandering away your money in riotous living, in leudne&s;s and debauchery, in the fopperies of dre&s;s, in frequent and expen&s;ive diver&s;ions, and the like? The&s;e are all co&s;t|ly and impoveri&s;hing vices: And &s;ome of them are as prejudicial to the health of your bodies, as they are to your pur&s;es and your &s;ouls. How many &s;ad examples have there been of people, particularly of young men, that have, by the&s;e and &s;uch-like follies and exce&s;&s;es, ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed them&s;elves as to this world?&mdash;their reputation, their e&s;|tates, their health, their lives!&mdash;"Be not over much wicked," &s;ays the wi&s;e man; "neither be thou fooli&s;h: Why &s;houlde&s;t thou die before thy time?" But when or where did you ever know a young man ruin and de&s;troy him&s;elf by his wi&s;dom or &s;obriety, his virtue and religion!</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="264" REF="009440_0279_0F748FC6B5AFA700">
6. IF it &s;hould be &s;aid, that a man has &s;ometimes an opportunity to increa&s;e his riches by di&s;hone&s;t means;&mdash;for example, by lying, perjury, extortion, taking bribes, theft, fraud, or lawle&s;s violence and robbery: And that, if he foregoes the&s;e tempting and <HI>precious opportunities</HI> for the &s;ake of religion and a good con&s;cience, his virtue is then prejudicial to his intere&s;t: I will not "&s;peak wickedly for God," by ab&s;olutely denying that any man ever did, or can, increa&s;e his wealth by &s;uch unju&s;t means: Even our own age and country might furni&s;h &s;ome examples of this kind. But let me make a few queries here. Do you not think, there are many <HI>more</HI> people, who hurt their worldly intere&s;t in the end by di&s;hone&s;ty; by lo&s;ing their credit, character and bu&s;ine&s;s, than there are who prejudice it by a &s;trict adherence to truth and ju&s;tice, and a &s;teady per&s;everance in hone&s;t cour&s;es? I think this will admit of no doubt: So that the advantage, upon the whole, is &s;till on the &s;ide of virtue and &s;obriety. But, admitting that you were ab&s;olutely &s;ure, as you cannot be, of bettering your worldly circum&s;tances in the end, by any iniquitous means; let me next a&s;k, <HI>How much</HI> you think it is <HI>hone&s;tly</HI> worth to be a knave; a liar, cheat, or per|jured villain? I conclude, you would not for|feit your honor and con&s;cience for a very tri|fling &s;um, as many have done. For <HI>how much</HI> then, do you think it would really be worth while to do it? Even Balaam, who &s;ecretly
<PB N="265" REF="009440_0280_0F748FC7EE991F78">
loved the wages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, could not but &s;ay in his calm reflexions, when Balak the King of Moab offered, him a large &s;um to do a wicked thing&mdash;<Q>If Balak would give me his hou&s;e-full of &s;ilver and gold, I can|not go beyond the commandment of the Lord, to do good or bad.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm XXIV</NOTE>&mdash;Now, was this a rea&s;onable reflexion, or was it not? You cannot deny it to be &s;o. And can you hope, by any unrighteous means, to get more than a royal palace-full of &s;ilver and gold? And if you could, yet would not the&s;e un|godly gains be over-ballanced by the unea&s;y reflexions in your own minds? Would not your real happine&s;s in this world be rather ob&s;tructed than promoted, by the&s;e unrighte|ous, tho' gainful practices? But &s;uch great gains of iniquity and fraud, as the&s;e, are wholly imaginary, unle&s;s perhaps, you were kings or princes, or their chief <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>favourites,</HI>&mdash;If you are di&s;hone&s;t, or ever &s;o wicked and avaritious; yet you mu&s;t play at far <HI>&s;maller games</HI> than the&s;e. Nay, according to the ordinary, e&s;tabli&s;hed cour&s;e of things, intere&s;t is actually on the &s;ide of virtue and hone&s;ty. Tho' religion, honor and con&s;cience were wholly out of the que&s;tion; yet any <HI>common man</HI> would run a mo&s;t imprudent ri&s;que in becoming a knave and villain, with a view to worldly gain.

inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, fraud and violence. How often do men utterly ruin their credit, and with it, their temporal intere&s;t, by be|ing greedy of gain, and u&s;ing lawle&s;s means to obtain it? Yea, how often do they hereby procure infamous puni&s;hment, with the lo&s;s of all, from the hands of civil ju&s;tice? and even capital puni&s;hment? It is therefore evi|dent, upon the whole, according to the good old proverb, that <HI>hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy;</HI> tho' we confine our views intirely to worldly gain and profit. <Q>An inheritance may be gotten ha&s;tily at the beginning, &s;ays the wi&s;e man, but the end thereof &s;hall not be ble&s;&s;ed.</Q>&mdash;And again: <Q>Envy not the oppre&s;&s;or, and and chu&s;e none of his ways&mdash;The cur&s;e of the Lord is in the hou&s;e of the wicked: but he ble&s;&s;eth the habitation of the ju&s;t.</Q> And God declareth by the prophet Jeremiah, That <Q>as the partridge fitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; &s;o he that getteth riches, and not by right, &s;hall leave them in the mid&s;t of his days; and at his end &s;hall be a fool.</Q></P>
<P N="7">7. BUT you will &s;ay, perhaps, that giving alms to the poor is one of the duties of reli|gion; and that this is directly contrary to a per&s;on's worldly intere&s;t, and tends to pover|ty. Let me briefly hint a few things, re|lative to this objection. And, fir&s;t; in giving alms every man is bound in rea&s;on to have &s;ome con&s;ideration of his own ability, circum|&s;tances, real occa&s;ions, and the obligations of
<PB N="267" REF="009440_0282_0F748FC8F43710C0">
ju&s;tice to his family, and to others. No per|&s;on, except in &s;ome very uncommon ca&s;es, is obliged to give more than he can afford with|out much difficulty, or &s;treightning him&s;elf; never, more than is con&s;i&s;tent with the obli|gations which he is under to others in point of ju&s;tice. In the next place, if you are in|du&s;trious, and avoid all fooli&s;h, extravagant and &s;inful expences, as religion obliges you to be and do, you may the better afford to give &s;omething to the nece&s;&s;itous &s;ick and poor. A quarter part of what many con|&s;ume in their expen&s;ive follies and vices, both to the hurt of them&s;elves and others, might make them tolerable good chri&s;tians in point of alms-giving, if employed in that way, from a good principle. Tho' you &s;hould di&s;charge this chri&s;tian duty, as far as could in rea&s;on be expected of you, yet it would probably be much le&s;s expen&s;ive to you than tho&s;e vices, follies and exce&s;&s;es, which are common a|mong&s;t young men: And you would, at the &s;ame time, have a rational and &s;olid &s;atisfaction therein; whereas &s;hame and remor&s;e are the natural fruits of intemperance and luxury, riot and debauchery. Again: Though you were wholly de&s;titute of chri&s;tian &s;obriety; yet if you had but common humanity, you would not refu&s;e an alms, once in a while, to a mi&s;erable fellow-creature ready to peri&s;h with cold or hunger, when it was in your power to relieve him. So that your being truly religious, and giving alms from a chri|&s;tian
<PB N="268" REF="009440_0283_0F748FC9B2D492C0">
principle, might not, perhaps, be the occa&s;ion of any great addition to your expen|ces of this &s;ort: I mean, unle&s;s you were o|therwi&s;e to be hardened to a great degree in|deed; &s;o as to be de&s;titute of the common feelings of pity and compa&s;&s;ion, as well as of the love of God. You mu&s;t get rid of all &s;ympathy and humanity, and be wor&s;e than barbarians; I mean, become <HI>mi&s;ers,</HI> if you would &s;ave all expences of this kind; for, mere|ly being de&s;titute of chri&s;tianity, will not an|&s;wer the end. Moreover; you may rea&s;ona|bly expect the ble&s;&s;ing of God abundantly to make up to you whatever you be&s;tow in di&s;|crete and well-timed charity to the poor, ac|cording to his commandments. There are many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, directly to this purpo&s;e. I have time to remind you of two or three only, from the writings of Solomon&mdash;Honor the Lord with thy &s;ub&s;tance;&mdash;&s;o <Q>&s;hall thy barns be filled with plenty&mdash;He that giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord; and that which he giveth, he will &s;urely repay him.</Q> And very ob&s;ervable is the following pa&s;&s;age: <Q>There is that &s;cattereth, and yet increa&s;eth: And there is that with-holdeth more than is meet; but it tendeth to poverty.

XI. 24, 25.</NOTE> You can then have no rea&s;onable objection again&s;t religion, on account of its tendency to impoveri&s;h you in the way of alms-giving: But this objection
<PB N="269" REF="009440_0284_0F748FCB5088D578">
&s;tands in great force again&s;t irreligion, oppre&s;|&s;ion, uncharitablene&s;s, &s;loth, luxury, riot, and every kind of vicious exce&s;s.</P>
<P>UPON laying together what has been &s;aid under this, and &s;ome preceding heads of ar|gument, there is one general, and very im|portant reflection in favour of religion, which naturally ari&s;es. It is this, that as a &s;ober, re|ligious life is the only rea&s;onable one; &s;o it is by far the happie&s;t, and, in all re&s;pects, the mo&s;t for your advantage in this world. If you place happine&s;s in having peace of mind; that has been &s;hewn to be the genuine fruit of religion; as di&s;quietude within, is the in|variable con&s;equence of irreligion, vice and folly. If you place it in reputation, or the good opinion of others; that is the natural at|tendant of virtue and &s;obriety; as contempt and di&s;grace are of the contrary. If you place it in bodily health and long life; the&s;e are mo&s;t effectually promoted by &s;obriety; as &s;ickne&s;s, pains and a premature death, are the frequent effects of intemperance, and profli|gate morals. If you place it in worldly riches; religion and virtue are very friendly to it in this view: Whereas there are many vices which tend directly to poverty; much more &s;o, than any one virtue that can be named. The&s;e things are not only certain, but obvi|ous; they lie level to all capacites. And is it not a great recommendation of religion to your judgment, your rea&s;on, that it is the mo&s;t &s;ure and effectual means imaginable,
<PB N="270" REF="009440_0285_0F748FCC11A420E8">
&s;ame extraordinary ca&s;es being excepted, to promote your temporal felicity in all the&s;e re&s;pects?&mdash;your peace of mind, your reputa|tion and honor, your health with length of days, and your intere&s;t, in the mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;en&s;e of this word? This is &s;trict truth, ac|cording to the e&s;tabli&s;hed cour&s;e of things, at lea&s;t in all countries where the true religi|on is publickly countenanced, and generally profe&s;&s;ed. So that tho' "gain is not godline&s;s," as &s;ome may imagine; yet we have the be&s;t authority to &s;ay, that <Q>godline&s;s is profitable unto ALL things; having promi&s;e of the <HI>life that now is,</HI> and of that which is to come. This is a faithful &s;aying.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tim. IV. 8, 9.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>WHAT then are all tho&s;e imaginations which young people commonly entertain a|bout religion, as if it were unfriendly to their temporal intere&s;t and felicity? What are all &s;uch imaginations, I &s;ay, but idle fancies, chimeras and hobgoblins, which mere fiction, or the father of lies has invented, to impo&s;e upon your credulity, and deceive you to your de&s;truction? As if the ways of wi&s;dom, of virtue and of God, were gloomy, joyle&s;s, hard and di&s;agreeable; and tho&s;e of folly, vice and &s;atan, ea&s;y, profitable, delightful, and truly happy! What a reproach is it to human nature, that &s;uch bugbears as the&s;e;&mdash;conceits, &s;o contrary to all probability and &s;en&s;e, to the word of God, and to the experi|ence of all wi&s;e and good men, &s;hould ever

gain the lea&s;t credit, &s;o as to frighten either the old or young from being &s;ober-minded; and to make them believe that true happine&s;s is the fruit of error, folly and vice!</P>
<P>IT is probable that &s;ome well-meaning men have contributed largely to the carrying on &s;o &s;trange and pernicious a delu&s;ion, not only by their own gloomy, and over-au&s;tere be|haviour; but by abridging the innocent plea|&s;ures and liberties of youth, in divers re&s;pects; particularly by repre&s;enting all recreations and pa&s;times as incon&s;i&s;tent with pure and unde|filed religion, in&s;tead of being content with guarding again&s;t the abu&s;es of them. There is ground to think that the&s;e irrational and un&s;criptural &s;everities, have been a fatal &s;tum|bling-block to many young people; and made them dread the very thoughts of religion, as if it were an irreconcileable foe to all tempo|ral happine&s;s. But as it is incumbent upon the teachers of religion, utterly to di&s;counte|nance every thing that is unrea&s;onable, and contrary to the laws of God; they ought doubtle&s;s, on the other hand, to allow and permit to all, particularly to the young, all tho&s;e innocent liberties and amu&s;ements, which the word of God allows or permits. He that adds to the commandments, by for|bidding what God has not forbidden, is as pre&s;umptuous and criminal as he that dimi|ni&s;hes from them, by nullifying &s;ome of his precepts. In many ca&s;es the former is of as bad con&s;equence as the latter, to the intere&s;t
<PB N="272" REF="009440_0287_0F748FCD769B4368">
of virtue and religion in the world. It is &s;o particularly in this ca&s;e, when the young are deterred from being &s;ober-minded, by being unwarrantably abridged of tho&s;e recreations and amu&s;ements, which God has not prohi|bited, and which human nature, in it's pre|&s;ent &s;tate, &s;eems to require. Nor are the "teaching for doctrine the commandments of men," and laying "heavy burdens, grie|vous to be borne, on men's &s;houlders," the &s;lighte&s;t accu&s;ations which our Lord brought again&s;t tho&s;e <HI>grave, au&s;tere, proud, &s;olemn-fac'd</HI> hypocrites, the ancient &s;cribes and phari&s;ees.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the lawfulne&s;s and the abu&s;es of Recreations, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Serm.

<P>IX. YOUR future <HI>u&s;efulne&s;s,</HI> as well as your own honor, intere&s;t and happine&s;s in the world, greatly depends upon your &s;obriety and good conduct. He that lives &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the world, cannot be a mi&s;chievous member of &s;ociety: Nay,
<PB N="273" REF="009440_0288_0F748FCEC5C5D820">
he cannot but be &s;erviceable, and a real ornament to it in his &s;tation, whether high or low; as every member of the natural body, in the regu|lar di&s;charge of its particular office, contributes to the good and perfection of the body. But can the &s;ame be &s;aid with equal truth and pro|priety, of irreligious, wicked and profligate men? It cannot.</P>
<P>IT is indeed owned, that bad men &s;ometimes do much good in the world. But this is either, fir&s;t, only accidentally; as we &s;ay good may be brought out of evil. Or, &s;econdly, the good which they do, is by &s;uch of their actions as are in their nature good, lawful and right, externally con&s;idered; not by their wicked and unrighteous deeds. Or, la&s;tly, they may do good to the world by &s;erving as examples and warnings to it, of the &s;hame and mi&s;ery which are the natural con&s;equence of vice and folly: So that, by their means, others are deterred from pur&s;uing tho&s;e cour&s;es which are ruinous and de&s;tructive. Thus, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the pride, luxury and debauchery of the rich, may be the occa&s;ion of di&s;per&s;ing their wealth, and feeding the poor. In the &s;econd ca&s;e, a vicious man who is diligent in his lawful worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, who fights bravely for his king and country, or who di&s;charges any civil office tolerably well, may thereby do good. Any of the&s;e things may be done by a very wicked man; but yet he that thus &s;erves his country, does it not by his wickedne&s;s; but by that part of his conduct which is lawful and right. And in the third ca&s;e mentioned, the thief, robber, or other
<PB N="274" REF="009440_0289_0F748FCFAAE3DFA8">
malefactor, benefits his country by being hang'd; and &s;erving for a terror and warning to evil-doers. In the&s;e three &s;en&s;es, very wicked men may be &s;erviceable to the world. But how much mi&s;|chief is commonly done by them in other re|&s;pects? What &s;ore &s;courges? what cur&s;es, have many wicked men been to the world, e&s;pecially in high &s;tations?&mdash;to whole provinces, countries and kingdoms?&mdash;yea, to &s;everal kingdoms at once? And other wicked men commonly do mi&s;|chief in the world, in &s;ome proportion to their &s;tation, and the &s;phere in which they act. Con|&s;ider, on the other hand, what great and exten|&s;ive ble&s;&s;ings many good men have been to the world, e&s;pecially in high &s;tations;&mdash;to their coun|try, nation, and divers nations at once: And other good men in a lower degree, according to their &s;ituation, power and influence. Which good they do directly, with de&s;ign; not acci|dentally, as the wicked may do it in &s;ome in|&s;tances and degrees.</P>
<P>NOW, my young brethren, if you have the lea&s;t ingenuity, or genero&s;ity of mind, you would chu&s;e to be ble&s;&s;ings, and not cur&s;es to the world. You would chu&s;e to fill up your re&s;pective &s;ta|tions in life, at once with honor to your&s;elves, and benefit to &s;ociety: Both which you will do the mo&s;t effectually by being truly virtuous and &s;ober-minded. Can you, without pain or regret, think of living rather as common nu&s;ances, than to the advantage of tho&s;e with whom you are connected?&mdash;or even, of living and dying u&s;e|le&s;s?&mdash;Or, if not intirely u&s;ele&s;s; yet would you
<PB N="275" REF="009440_0290_0F748FCFB76B8BB8">
be willing that what good you do, &s;hould be as it were by accident, as the indirect con&s;equence of your behaviour, in&s;tead of being done inten|tionally and uprightly; &s;o that it may be &s;aid to be the proper con&s;equence of a virtuous and lau|dable behaviour? Or would you be willing to benefit &s;ociety, only by being &s;ad examples and warnings to it, of the di&s;grace and mi&s;ery in which vice naturally terminates; and &s;o making other men wi&s;e and cautious, virtuous and happy at your expence?&mdash;e&s;pecially at &s;o dear a rate, as your own infamy and de&s;truction! If you well dige&s;t the&s;e thoughts in your minds, they will fill you with an ardent, a truly noble de&s;ire to do good in your day; to be &s;erviceable in your re&s;|pective places, in&s;tead of hurtful; and therefore to be wi&s;e and virtuous: E&s;pecially when you con&s;ider, that this will be, beyond all compari|&s;on, the mo&s;t honourable, profitable and delight|ful to your&s;elves.</P>
<P>X. IT &s;hould be an argument of no &s;mall weight with you to be &s;ober-minded, that you will hereby <HI>plea&s;e your be&s;t friends;</HI> whereas, by the contrary, you will di&s;plea&s;e, grieve and of|fend them. Do you a&s;k, who the&s;e good, the&s;e be&s;t friends are? I an&s;wer, in the fir&s;t place,</P>
<P>GOD, your Father in heaven.

If God invites, if he encourages, if he requires you to believe in, to love him, to walk in his righteous ways, certainly he will be plea&s;|ed with your doing &s;o; and di&s;plea&s;ed if you do otherwi&s;e. Has he not &s;aid, "I love them that love me, and they that &s;eek me early, &s;hall find me?" Is not his holy Spirit &s;aid to "&s;trive with men," to this end? and to be "grieved" with the&s;e that re&s;i&s;t and oppo&s;e him?&mdash;with them that abu&s;e his goodne&s;s and oppo&s;e his light and truth; chu&s;ing to walk in the paths of darkne&s;s and error, vice and mi&s;ery?

Ch.

It is &s;aid, that when the fooli&s;h, unhappy youth was on his return home, but while he was "yet a great way off, his father &s;aw him, and had compa&s;&s;ion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and ki&s;&s;ed him."

And pre&s;ently after, the father is introduced, &s;aying to the elder brother, "It was meet that we &s;hould make merry, and be glad; for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lo&s;t, and is found." Thus compa&s;&s;ionate is God, to tho&s;e who err from his truth and ways; and thus plea&s;ed when they repent and return. This is al&s;o the principal &s;cope of two other parables in the &s;ame chapter:<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke Ch.

"Like as a father pitieth his children," &s;ays the p&s;almi&s;t, "&s;o the Lord pitieth them that fear him." And, &s;urely, you have no friend equally good and great as the God and Father of all; none whom you are un|der &s;uch &s;trong obligations to plea&s;e; none, whom you ought, from a principle of ingenuity and gratitude, to be &s;o cautious of offending.</P>
<P>ANOTHER of tho&s;e good friends, whom you will plea&s;e by your &s;obriety, is the Son of God, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who loved you &s;o well as to come down from heaven, to live a mi&s;e|rable life on earth, and to die an ignominious, accur&s;ed death upon a cro&s;s, for your redemption. This you may be po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured of: For "he gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for ALL;"&mdash;"ta&s;ted death for EVERY man," and is the "propitiation for the &s;ins of the WHOLE world." In the days of his fle&s;h, he &s;hewed the tendere&s;t love and kindne&s;s, not only to young men, as is re|corded upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, but even to little

children; taking them up in his arms, ble&s;&s;ing them, and &s;aying, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven." Our com|pa&s;&s;ionate Saviour is &s;aid to have been grieved for the hardne&s;s of their hearts, who refu&s;ed to receive his heavenly in&s;tructions, coun&s;els and warnings, de&s;igned for their good. And how tenderly did he lament the folly, the impeni|tence, and the approaching de&s;truction of Jeru|&s;alem, when he beheld the city, and <Q>wept over it, &s;aying, If thou had&s;t known, even thou, at lea&s;t in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hidden from thine eyes.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke XIX. 42.</NOTE> And again: O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, thou that kille&s;t the prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them which are &s;ent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as an hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</Q><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt.

His goodne&s;s is unchanged; he can &s;till have compa&s;&s;ion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; being a merciful, as well as faithful high prie&s;t, in things pertaining unto God.

THE holy angels, tho' un&s;een and unknown by you, are other, and truly excellent friends to you; whom you would highly plea&s;e and delight, by obeying their Lord and our's; and whom you di&s;plea&s;e by per&s;evering in your &s;inful ways.

NOW you cannot in the lea&s;t doubt, but that you will highly gratify the devil and his angels, by rejecting the truth of God; by denying and bla&s;pheming Je&s;us Chri&s;t; by neglecting the wor|&s;hip of God, de&s;pi&s;ing the ordinances of the go&s;|pel, and living wicked lives. The&s;e are the very things which they aim at; which they have all along been, and are &s;till temping you to do, not in vain; the very things in which they place their joy, triumph and glory. Every time you &s;et your&s;elves to oppo&s;e the truth; every time you take God's name in vain; every time you turn your backs with contempt upon Chri&s;t's in|&s;titutions; every time you &s;peak fal&s;ely, or do any wicked thing, then it is that you plea&s;e the devil; and the farther you are from all &s;obriety of mind, the more dear will you be to him. You cannot more di&s;oblige the&s;e apo&s;tate &s;pirits, than by a gracious reception of the go&s;pel, and bring|ing forth fruits meet for repentance. They have a fixed aver&s;ion to all &s;obriety, all truth, all god|line&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s, humility, charity and tem|perance. Be&s;ides: Whenever any per&s;on, old or young, repents and returns to God, the devil is enraged at the thoughts of lo&s;ing a &s;ubject; he con&s;iders &s;uch a One as a rebel and traitor to him&s;elf, and is &s;orely vexed at having the prey which he was on the point of devouring, &s;natch|ed as it were out of his jaws.

<P>BUT what has &s;atan ever done for you, that you &s;hould be de&s;irous or willing to plea&s;e him? Is he your maker? No. Does he pre&s;erve and take care of you? No. Did he die for you?

LASTLY here, By continuing in your &s;ins, you will probably plea&s;e &s;ome of the mo&s;t fooli&s;h and abandoned of mankind, both male and fe|male. Such per&s;ons as the&s;e, may be in &s;ome mea&s;ure kept in countenance, and perhaps other|wi&s;e gratified, by having you for their compa|nions in folly and wickedne&s;s. And, on the other hand, &s;hould you become virtuous and &s;o|ber, they might be di&s;gu&s;ted thereat; looking upon your reformation and good conduct as a tacit reproach to them&s;elves for their continued profligacy, and depraved manners.

E&s;pecially, when by that means you will certainly di&s;plea&s;e and trouble many wi&s;e and virtuous people; your parents and others, who are unque&s;tionably your friends. Let me here remind you of a pa&s;&s;age in the Proverbs of Solomon, relating to the enticements of evil companions; not merely becau&s;e it is directly to the point in hand, but becau&s;e I have not any where el&s;e, perhaps, &s;o particularly warned you as to this matter, as would have been proper. <Q>My &s;on, &s;ays the wi&s;e man, if &s;inners entice thee, con&s;ent thou not.

THUS you have &s;een on one hand, whom you will certainly plea&s;e by being &s;ober-minded; and on the other hand, whom you will, or may po&s;&s;ibly gratify by the contrary. By it you will plea&s;e God, your Maker and compa&s;&s;ionate Father; the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who laid down his life for you; the good &s;pirit of God, which is &s;triving with you; the holy angels, who are daily mini&s;tring unto you; the noble army of martyrs, and all the &s;aints in heaven, who long to hail your arrival there; your parents, and many other wi&s;e and good men on earth, who &s;incerely wi&s;h well to you.

This, I think, is &s;umming up the pre&s;ent argument fairly and impartially: Nor will I call in que&s;tion the goodne&s;s of your under&s;tandings &s;o much, my young brethren, as to &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible for you to doubt in any degree, whether it becomes you to gratify the former or the latter.

XII. IF you &s;hould continue in the practice of vice, folly and wickedne&s;s, one <HI>principal end</HI> of Chri&s;t's coming into the world;&mdash;of his teaching, life and death, will, as to you, be <HI>intirely fru&s;trated.</HI> The important end which I have here in view, is your recovery to a &s;ound mind; your deliverance from your natural darkne&s;s and depravity, your lu&s;ts, and &s;inful practices; by being brought to the knowledge, love and practice of true virtue, godline&s;s, and all good works. That this was a principal end of Chri&s;t's mediation, is very clearly and forcibly declared in the &s;ame chapter with my text, as an argu|ment for &s;obriety and good works. <Q>For the grace of God that bringeth &s;alvation to all men, [&s;o it might be rendered] hath appeared; teaching us that, denying ungodline&s;s, and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righ|teou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world.</Q> And again afterwards; <Q>Who gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</Q> Now what do the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions imply, either more or le&s;s than this, That one great de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's mediation, and of the grace of God appearing in the go&s;pel, was, that we might be &s;ober-minded in that comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e, in which the&s;e terms were explained in &s;ome preceeding di&s;cour&s;es? The whole evangelical hi&s;tory, wherein we have an account of our Lord's doctrine, example and precepts; and all the apo&s;tolical writings in general, are a clear, inconte&s;tible proof of the
<PB N="289" REF="009440_0304_0F748EFB5843D678">
&s;ame thing. And does it not from hence as plainly appear, that if you continue to live un&s;oberly, unrighteou&s;ly and ungodly in the world, you will thereby counteract and defeat one principal end of Chri&s;t's manife&s;ta|tion in the fle&s;h? Let me add, that if this de&s;ign of his mediation is fru&s;trated as to you, it will be in vain for you to expect, that the other important ends thereof will be an&s;we|red; &s;uch as, your being pardoned and ju&s;tified, and being finally happy in the kingdom of heaven. For without that repentance and faith, which are the principle and beginning of a &s;ober, righteous and godly life, there is no forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, no ju&s;tification with God, no title to future glory, honor and im|mortality.</P>
<P>IF you pay any regard at all to the chri&s;|tian revelation, as I pre&s;ume you do, you can|not, &s;urely, but be in &s;ome mea&s;ure concer|ned, that the de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's mediation in general, and particularly this e&s;&s;ential and important part thereof, may be an&s;wered as to your&s;elves. One would think, you mu&s;t be greatly &s;hocked at the thought of its being fru&s;trated by your per&s;evering in the ways of vice and folly; as tho' the Son and grace of God had never appeared, bringing &s;alvation to all that will thankfully accept of it. What! did the Son of God, the brightne&s;s of his glo|ry, and "in whom dwelt all the fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodily;" did the Son of God, I &s;ay, give him&s;elf for you, that he might re|deem
<PB N="290" REF="009440_0305_0F748EFC0DD4E8A8">
you from all iniquity,&mdash;from the pow|er, as well as the guilt of fin; and will you, notwith&s;tanding this, live in the practice of &s;in, of ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts! Hath &s;uch grace appeared, and has the Lord from heaven preached and died, that he might pu|rify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good works; and will you &s;till do the works of darkne&s;s, the works of the devil, tho&s;e evil works which God abhorreth! I am a&s;toni&s;hed, and even tremble, as you may well do, to think of your thus counteracting the de&s;ign of the glorious go&s;pel. What the con|&s;equence of this will be, may appear more particularly in my next di&s;cour&s;e. In the mean time, let me exhort you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider of the matter; and to bear in mind tho&s;e words of the apo&s;tle, with which I conclude for the pre&s;ent&mdash;<Q>Therefore we ought to give the more earne&s;t heed to the things which we have heard, le&s;t at any time we &s;hould let them &s;lip.

<P>THE fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e upon this &s;ubject was taken up with &s;ome introductory ob|&s;ervations. In the &s;econd and third, the nature of chri&s;tian &s;obriety was di&s;tinctly
<PB N="292" REF="009440_0307_0F748EFCF98AE948">
explained. In the fourth and fifth, divers &s;ins, follies and exce&s;&s;es, which are repug|nant thereto, were particularly pointed out. In the &s;ixth and &s;eventh, I exhorted you to be &s;ober-minded, by &s;everal con&s;iderations of great, tho' not all of equal weight. I &s;hall now, by the will of God, proceed in this ex|hortation, my young brethren, by laying be|fore you &s;ome other motives and arguments, if po&s;&s;ible, more important in their nature than tho&s;e which have been mentioned al|ready: For which rea&s;on they have been re&s;erved as the la&s;t. But they are very com|mon arguments; &s;uch as are at lea&s;t hinted at in almo&s;t every chapter of the new-te&s;ta|ment, and touched upon in almo&s;t every &s;ermon you hear; as arguments of &s;o intere&s;t|ing a nature, and &s;uch general u&s;e, ought doubtle&s;s to be. Their commonne&s;s, how|ever, will at lea&s;t warrant my being &s;horter upon &s;ome of them, than would otherwi&s;e be convenient. To proceed then,</P>
<P>XIII. IF you are &s;ober-minded in life, you will <HI>die happily,</HI> in a &s;tate of <HI>favor with God.</HI> <Q>Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my la&s;t end be like his</Q>;&mdash;was the wi&s;h and prayer of that &s;ame wicked Balaam, who loved the wages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; but at a time when he was under the prophetic and divine afflatus, and thereby carried into futurity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. XXIII. 10.</NOTE> This is probably, in &s;ome &s;ort, the de&s;ire of all wicked men in general; at lea&s;t,
<PB N="293" REF="009440_0308_0F748EFDBAE168F8">
of all who live under the light of the go&s;pel, whenever they think of death. This they are often obliged to do; and are indeed, ma|ny of them, thro' fear of death, all their life|time &s;ubject to a mi&s;erable bondage. How differently &s;oever men chu&s;e to live; yet all in general would chu&s;e to die alike; to die the death of the righteous;&mdash;in peace and fa|vor with the great God, and in hope of his glory.</P>
<P>NOW, to be truly wi&s;e and virtuous; to live the life of the righteous; or, in the good words of the &s;ame wicked Balaam, "to do ju&s;tly, and to love mercy, and to walk hum|bly with your God,"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Micah VI. 8.</NOTE> is the &s;ure way to die the death of the righteous. But it is impo&s;&s;ible in the nature of the thing, that a wicked, un|righteous man, continuing &s;uch, &s;hould die thus. Let me briefly guard again&s;t two mi&s;|con&s;tructions of my meaning here. Fir&s;t, it is not hereby intended, that what is called, or truly is, a &s;ober, chri&s;tian and godly life, is a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, in which to &s;tand un&s;haken at God's tribunal, or to meet death with compo&s;ure, firmne&s;s and triumph, inde|pendently of the redemption wrought out by Chri&s;t, the gracious promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, or the "righteou&s;ne&s;s of God by faith." That &s;obriety of mind and manners, which is to give you peace and hope in death, is a chri&s;tian &s;obriety: And this &s;uppo&s;es repen|tance of &s;in, chri&s;tian faith, an humble &s;en&s;e
<PB N="294" REF="009440_0309_0F748EFEEDD4BA20">
of you own unworthine&s;s, and a dependence upon the grace of God in Chri&s;t, for accep|tance with him. Your hopes both in life and death, are to be grounded ultimately upon the free grace of God, as revealed in the go&s;|pel; and upon your own &s;obriety, in reflect|ing thereon, only indirectly or mediately, con&s;idered as an evidence of your being in a &s;tate of favor with God, as the required con|dition of, and a meetne&s;s, preparation or qualification for, future happine&s;s: Or, in other words, as it is <HI>characteri&s;tical</HI> of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who are entitled to the benefits of Chri&s;t's redemption. Secondly, it is not here|by intended, that none can be &s;aved, accor|ding to the terms of the go&s;pel, be&s;ides tho&s;e who have lived for a number of years, or &s;ome con&s;iderable time, in that &s;ober, righ|teous and godly manner, which the go&s;pel requires. Whenever a &s;inner becomes a true penitent and believer, in the &s;en&s;e of &s;crip|ture, he is immediately pardoned, ju&s;tified, and in a &s;tate of &s;alvation: Whether he lives afterwards to do works meet for repentance, affects not the &s;afety of his &s;tate, or the cer|tainty of his &s;alvation; tho' it may be of im|portance to him in other re&s;pects, particularly as to his peace, comfort and hope in death; or as an evidence of the genuinene&s;s of his re|pentance, &s;aith, and conver&s;ion to God.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e explanations, living a &s;ober and godly life, is on one hand nece&s;&s;ary, and on the other hand, lays a &s;olid foundation for
<PB N="295" REF="009440_0310_0F748EFF605C2A18">
peace and hope in death. The conciou&s;ne&s;s of having lived &s;uch a life, will exclude a &s;er|vile fear of death, and brighten tho&s;e natural|ly-gloomy moments. Whoever has light in the Lord to &s;ay with the p&s;almi&s;t&mdash;<Q>The Lord is my Shepherd&mdash;He re&s;toreth my &s;oul; he leadeth me in the paths of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s;</Q> will of cour&s;e be enabled to join with him in the words following: <Q>Yea, tho' I walk through the valley of the &s;ha|dow of death, I will fear no evil: For thou art with me; thy rod and thy &s;taff they comfort me.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al.

hereto, it is laid down as a &s;tanding, general maxim in &s;cripture, that "the righteous hath hope in his death:" A maxim which has been abundantly verified in all ages of the world, ever &s;ince death by &s;in entered into it. And the faithful, in every period of the chri&s;tian church more e&s;pecially, have been able to triumph over death, &s;aying, <Q>O death, where is thy &s;ting? O grave, where is thy victory? The &s;ting of death is &s;in, and the &s;trength of &s;in is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory, thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor.

<P>NOW, my young brethren, &s;ince you mu&s;t unque&s;tionably die &s;ooner or later, would you not chu&s;e to die in &s;uch a joyful, triumphant manner; meeting this la&s;t enemy, death, with "hopes full of immortality;" and, tho' naturally the "king of terrors," rather as your friendly deliverer from all pain and &s;or|row, than with fear and trembling? I know you are de&s;irous of this; you cannot but wi&s;h for &s;uch an happy and glorious exit, whenever your appointed time &s;hall come. In one word then, be &s;ober-minded; for this will make both life and death happy to you.</P>
<P>XIV. IT will not be unnatural to draw my next argument, from a con&s;ideration of <HI>that ble&s;&s;ed, glorious</HI> and <HI>eternal life,</HI>" which God that cannot lie, hath promi&s;ed to all them that believe in his Son, and keep his command|ments. A principal de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, is
<PB N="297" REF="009440_0312_0F748F00B4E006A8">
to proclaim and in&s;ure to tho&s;e who practi|cally believe it, a glorious re&s;urrection at our Lord's &s;econd appearing, and eternal happi|ne&s;s in the kingdom of God, as his free gift thro' Chri&s;t. This is the &s;um of the go&s;pel, expre&s;&s;ed in few words. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to refer to particular pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, for the&s;e gracious promi&s;es; the new-te&s;tament is full of them. If you are per&s;waded to be &s;ober-minded, this felicity, this unfading crown of glory and joy, will as &s;urely be your portion, as God and his word are true. Your mortal bodies, which are quickly to be &s;own in weakne&s;s, corruption and di&s;honor, will in due time be rai&s;ed in power, purity and glory, by the all-quickning voice of the Son of God. You &s;hall &s;tand at his right hand with great boldne&s;s, when he &s;its upon the throne of his glory, while all the guilty na|tions are trembling at his left. Then &s;hall your ears be ravi&s;hed, your &s;ouls tran&s;ported with tho&s;e gracious and mo&s;t joyful words, from the mouth of him that died for you, and to whom all judgment and authority are committed&mdash;<Q>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Fa|ther, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat.

<P><PB N="298" REF="009440_0313_0F748F024E1FD458">
CAN you think of the&s;e things, my young brethren, without being filled with an ardent de&s;ire to be made partakers of &s;uch an hap|pine&s;s, &s;uch glory, honor and immortality? I am &s;ure you cannot, if you really give cre|dit to them. What is any earthly inheritance which you may have in view, in compari&s;on with that to which the <Q>heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</Q> are entitled in the heavens! What are all worldly riches, but dro&s;s and vanity, in compari&s;on with the trea&s;ure there laid up for the righteous! How does all earthly glory &s;ink? how is it eclip&s;ed? how does it vani&s;h from the &s;ight, when you look forward to that, which the Lord of life and glory has promi&s;ed to them that love him? Ble&s;&s;ed indeed, thrice "ble&s;&s;ed are they that do his commandments; that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in thro' the gates into the city."&mdash;And "the throne of God and of the Lamb &s;hall be in it; and his &s;ervants &s;hall &s;erve him. And they &s;hall &s;ee his face; and his name &s;hall be in their foreheads. And there &s;hall be no night there, and they need no candle, neither light of the &s;un: For the Lord God giveth them light, and they &s;hall reign for ever and ever." Is it not worth while to be &s;ober-minded, virtu|ous and obedient, for &s;uch an happine&s;s, &s;uch glory as this; even tho' you &s;hould make your&s;elves wretched thereby, during this tran|&s;itory life, which is but as a vapor? Whereas the truth is, that you mu&s;t needs be mi&s;erable
<PB N="299" REF="009440_0314_0F748F02F3BADFC8">
even now, unle&s;s you are truly religious; and that, by making &s;ure of eternal life, you will, beyond all compari&s;on, be&s;t provide for your temporal honor and felicity.</P>
<P>XV. CONSIDER, in the next place, that unle&s;s you are truly penitent and &s;ober-mind|ed, the guilt of all your &s;ins will lie upon you, and you will be <HI>wretched in death.</HI> There is no forgivene&s;s with God, even thro' the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but in the way of unfeigned repentance towards the former, and faith to|wards the latter. Which repentance and faith are implied in chri&s;tian &s;obriety; and are the principle and &s;ub&s;tance of it, internally con|&s;idered; as has been ob&s;erved in the forego|ing di&s;cour&s;es. It is therefore ju&s;t as certain, that without &s;obriety of mind, you will re|main under guilt and condemnation, as it is, that repentance and faith are nece&s;&s;ary to pardon, according to the tenor of the go&s;pel: Than which there is no one thing more clear|ly a&s;&s;erted in the holy &s;criptures; tho' &s;ome per&s;ons, &s;uppo&s;e pardon and ju&s;tification to be prior to that repentance and faith, by or thro' which we are &s;aid to be pardoned and ju&s;tified. Ab&s;urd and prepo&s;terous indeed!</P>
<P>BUT not to digre&s;s: If you &s;hould continue in the practice of &s;in and folly, and remain impenitent till death; how dreadful an hour will that be to you! I mean if you &s;hould then have your thoughts and &s;en&s;es about you; and not be &s;natched out of the world in a moment, without time for reflexion on what
<PB N="300" REF="009440_0315_0F748F03B64ABA38">
is pa&s;t, or con&s;idering what is to come.&mdash;What horrors of con&s;cience? what di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h of &s;oul, will probably &s;eize upon you, when you &s;hall come to lie upon a &s;ick bed? When you &s;hall find your fle&s;h and your heart at once failing you; and God, not the &s;trength of your heart, nor likely to be your portion, but your terror, forever! When all your &s;ins are brought to your remembrance; when you reflect how you have abu&s;ed the good|ne&s;s and patience of God; how you have de|&s;pi&s;ed his grace and mercy; how you have &s;corned his reproofs and threatnings! When it will no longer be in your power to forget God, nor to think of him, but with fear and amazement, as that almighty, mo&s;t holy and righteous Being, whom you have offended! When the terrors of the la&s;t day, &s;hall be pre|&s;ent in imagination, and all the pains of hell that can be endured on earth, &s;hall "get hold upon you!" This is the &s;tate of wicked men under the go&s;pel, when they come to die; unle&s;s they are either &s;elf-deluded hypocrites, or quite &s;tupified, having their "con&s;ciences &s;eared as with an hot iron." Thus are they driven a way in God's anger, while the righ|teous have hope and joy in their death. They are often &s;o over-whelmed with a &s;en&s;e of their guilt, and have &s;uch a &s;entence of eter|nal death in them&s;elves,&mdash;in their own prophe|tic con&s;ciences, as not to have the lea&s;t heart or courage even to implore forgivene&s;s; or to &s;ay, "God be merciful to me a &s;inner"!&mdash;
<PB N="301" REF="009440_0316_0F748F052151CCE8">
Wretched &s;tate indeed; to have &s;uch a lively &s;en&s;e of &s;in, that the need of pardon is felt in the mo&s;t excruciating manner; and yet to have all conceptions of God's mercy, as it were &s;wallowed up and lo&s;t in tho&s;e of his righteous vengeance! Tho' by the way, if &s;inners &s;hould implore mercy at &s;uch a time, when they are under the actual arre&s;t of di|vine ju&s;tice, it is by no means clear either from rea&s;on or &s;cripture, that they &s;hall ob|tain it. For they may do &s;o, without that genuine repentance and faith, which the go&s;|pel makes nece&s;&s;ary in order to forgivene&s;s. And there are many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, which look quite the other way; I mean, which imply that the wicked may thus &s;ue for mercy, and yet be rejected; particularly a pa&s;&s;age in the Proverbs of Solomon, with which I &s;hall clo&s;e the pre&s;ent argument; and which I exhort you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, le&s;t your&s;elves &s;hould one day be &s;ad examples of the unutterable horrors of impenitent, dying &s;inners&mdash;"Becau&s;e I called, and ye refu&s;ed&mdash;ye have &s;et at nought all my coun&s;el, and would none of my reproof; I al&s;o will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh: When your fear cometh as de|&s;olation, and your de&s;truction cometh as a whirlwind; when di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h cometh upon you.

THERE is nothing &s;o near as the horror and de&s;pair of wicked men in the hour of death, to the actual torments of hell; whe|ther in re&s;pect of time, or of pain and angui&s;h: They are hell already begun in the &s;oul. My la&s;t argument &s;hall therefore be drawn.</P>
<P>XVI. FROM a con&s;ideration of the <HI>future mi&s;ery</HI> and <HI>puni&s;hment of the wicked,</HI> as foretold and repre&s;ented in the &s;acred oracles. You have already &s;een what the &s;ad con&s;equence of &s;in and folly will be, both in life and in death. It now remains for you to look be|yond life, death and the grave, into the eter|nal &s;tate; and &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider what the con&s;equence thereof is to be in the other world; a &s;tate, tho' invi&s;ible, yet not imagi|nary, but as real as the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>IF the only con&s;equence of dying in your &s;ins, were, to be excluded from the kingdom of heaven; to be bani&s;hed from the &s;ociety of ju&s;t men made perfect, and of the innumera|ble company of holy angels; from the face of him that once died to &s;ave you, and from the favourable pre&s;ence of your Creator, your God, your Father, in who&s;e pre&s;ence there is fulne&s;s of joy: I &s;ay, if you were only to be thus excluded from the regions of the ble&s;|&s;ed, thus turned off and di&s;carded, as unwor|thy of their fellow&s;hip; yet how can you en|dure the thoughts of this! When God pro|nounced only the following &s;entence upon the wicked Cain,&mdash;<Q>Now art thou cur&s;ed from the earth&mdash;when thou tille&s;t the
<PB N="303" REF="009440_0318_0F748F05FB7DACE0">

IV 11&mdash;14.</NOTE> This, &s;urely, was but a light puni&s;hment, in com|pari&s;on of being exiled hereafter from the everla&s;ting kingdom of Chri&s;t. Can you then, (unle&s;s you are more &s;tupified, more hardened and abandoned than that infamous murderer was) think, without the utmo&s;t grief and angui&s;h of &s;oul, of being excluded from heaven, and the ble&s;&s;ed &s;ociety thereof?&mdash;E&s;pecially, from the favour and enjoyment of Him, in who&s;e favour is life, and who&s;e loving-kindne&s;s is better than life; and to be fugitives and vagabonds in &s;ome unknown part of the world? Is this puni&s;hment no greater than you can bear? O di&s;mal exile indeed, tho' it were but for a few years or days! O in&s;upportable thought! unutterable woe! What! bani&s;hed from heaven, from the face of your God, your Father, your Saviour; as well as from the fellow&s;hip of good men, and holy angels! Think of it but a moment, and make it real to your&s;elves; and you will find cau&s;e for a far more bitter lamentation than that of Cain!&mdash;</P>

BUT perhaps the place, the country, to which the wicked are to be thus bani&s;hed and confined, will be an agreeable one; a delightful region in &s;ome yet-undi&s;covered part of the univer&s;e, where they may amu&s;e and enjoy them&s;elves in a con&s;iderable degree; and be con&s;oled, by the plea&s;urable &s;ituation, in their ab&s;ence from God, and the company of the ble&s;&s;ed in heaven. Far otherwi&s;e! Every place be&s;ides heaven, will be an hell, a place of torment, to the wicked.

<P>AND who are to be the companions of your exile, if this &s;hould be your own fate; as it mo&s;t certainly will, if you &s;hould live and die in your &s;ins?

Vain imagination! Your company will not alleviate, but increa&s;e your mi&s;ery. For what el&s;e can be expected from the &s;oci|ety

of wicked per&s;ons like your&s;elves, in a &s;tate of puni&s;hment; all, full of envy, rage, de&s;pair!

Can you expect to live in peace with, or to have any con&s;olation, any alleviation of your di&s;tre&s;s in the regions of woe, from &s;uch company as this?

Nor will you hereafter have any that are better, if you now reject that divine and ble&s;&s;ed Comforter, the Spirit of truth and holine&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps you flatter your&s;elves, that the time of this dreadful exile from God, in &s;uch a di&s;mal region, and in company far wor&s;e than the mo&s;t lonely &s;olitude, will be but &s;hort: So that it may be borne by the wicked, at lea&s;t with &s;ome patience, from the pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy relea&s;e, with liberty to enter into the man&s;ions of re&s;t and joy.

<P>THUS, my beloved young brethren, I have laid before you tho&s;e arguments and con&s;i|derations of various kinds, by which I would, and now do, exhort you to be &s;ober-minded. It was far from being my intention to &s;ay all, or even an hundredth part, that might be &s;aid with propriety upon this mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubject. To allude to the words of the a|po&s;tle John; if all the rea&s;ons for, and mo|tives to &s;obriety, were to be written down, "I &s;uppo&s;e that even the world it&s;elf could not contain the books that &s;hould be written." For the arguments for &s;obriety, or true reli|gion, are in a &s;ort infinite, like God the ob|ject thereof: There is no end of them to be
<PB N="311" REF="009440_0326_0F748F0CCA9DF0F8">
found; the &s;ubject is inexhau&s;tible, to any One that duly enters into the nature, &s;pirit and importance of it. The natural dictates of your own con&s;ciences, the holy &s;criptures, life and death, heaven, earth and hell, time and eternity; and even the commone&s;t ob|jects and occurrents, teem with arguments in an endle&s;s &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in behalf of true reli|gion; clearly and loudly admoni&s;hing you to be wi&s;e and &s;ober, if you have but an ear to hear, and an heart to perceive. This, in ge|neral, is the &s;entiment that Solomon expre&s;&s;es in the rhetorical, and nobly-&s;ublime manner following. <Q>Wi&s;dom crieth <HI>without;</HI> &s;he uttereth her voice in the <HI>&s;treets:</HI> She crieth in the chief place of <HI>concour&s;e;</HI> in the opening of the <HI>gates,</HI> in the <HI>city</HI> &s;he uttereth her words, &s;aying, How long, ye &s;imple ones, will ye love &s;implicity? and the &s;corners delight in their &s;corning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof: Behold I will pour out my &s;pirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</Q></P>
<P>I CAN neither di&s;tru&s;t the validity of tho&s;e arguments which have been particularly pro|po&s;ed to you, nor the goodne&s;s of your un|under&s;tandings, &s;o much as to &s;uppo&s;e it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to add any others to them, in order to the convincing your judgments what is the right, the wi&s;e&s;t, &s;afe&s;t, happie&s;t cour&s;e for you to pur&s;ue. No! I doubt not, but that this point, a very material one, is already gained. Would to God, that all your hearts
<PB N="312" REF="009440_0327_0F748F0DE4885738">
and wills were as much in the right as to this matter, as I am per&s;waded your heads are! And, methinks, you mu&s;t have &s;adly depra|ved and hardened hearts indeed, if even they are not in &s;ome mea&s;ure touched by &s;o many arguments, all drawn from the word of God; provided you have &s;o far attended to, as to have a tolerable under&s;tanding of them. And having thus far di&s;charged my own duty, by laying your's before you; the event mu&s;t now be left with your&s;elves, or rather with Him who hath the hearts of all men in his own hand. Without his ble&s;&s;ing, even pro|phets and apo&s;tles may preach in vain; much more, &s;o incon&s;iderable and unworthy a preacher of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, as he that is now &s;peaking to you.</P>
<P>BUT you will &s;ay, perhaps, "We are young; and need not be in any ha&s;te to be &s;ober-minded. It will an&s;wer the end as well a number of years hence, when we have in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ated our&s;elves with the plea|&s;ures of &s;in. How many are there about us, who, tho' much older, are not yet any wi&s;er or &s;oberer than our&s;elves? Let them &s;et us an example; it will be &s;ufficient for us to fol|low our &s;uperiors."</P>
<P>UNHAPPY young men! is the love of fol|ly and vice then &s;o deeply rooted in your hearts, that you cannot bear the thought of parting with them &s;o &s;oon? Do you think it hard and grievous to be put upon the remem|brance of your Creator, your Father, even
<PB N="313" REF="009440_0328_0F748F0E4CFF0AA8">
now in the days of your youth? If young men need not be &s;ober-minded, why did the in&s;pired apo&s;tle enjoin Titus to exhort them to be &s;o? Young men, certainly, need not be exhorted to any thing, which is not expedient for young men to do. So that you mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e the apo&s;tle was under &s;ome mi&s;take here, or el&s;e allow that your&s;elves have &s;ome wrong conceptions, &s;ome mi&s;apprehen&s;ions of the matter, when you think of deferring it to a later day. This, I &s;uppo&s;e, is a common, and often fatal error of the young. They are de&s;troyed, not &s;o much by any fixed, po|&s;itive re&s;olution, that they never will be vir|tuous and &s;ober, as by procra&s;tination, or putting off the concerns of religion to a far|ther, and, as they fondly imagine, more con|venient &s;ea&s;on. I propo&s;e therefore, di&s;tinct|ly and clearly, though briefly, to lay open the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch a conduct. This is, in ef|fect, what was mentioned in my fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e upon the &s;ubject, as the la&s;t branch of my ge|neral de&s;ign; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>FOURTHLY, TO &s;hew you the extreme folly and danger of delaying to be &s;ober-minded, till you are farther advanced in years. That this is both fooli&s;h and dangerous to the la&s;t degree, &s;hall be evinced by a variety of arguments; though I &s;hall not enlarge upon them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Several of the en&s;uing arguments, which are here only ju&s;t touched upon, are largely handled in the author's Sermons on P&s;alm CXIX. 59, 60. <HI>I thought on my ways&mdash;I made</HI> HASTE, &amp;c.

<P><PB N="314" REF="009440_0329_0F748F0EF5787618">
NOW, it &s;hould be ob&s;erved here, that all tho&s;e arguments in general, which have been produced in favour of religion, are as con|clu&s;ive with re&s;pect to the young, as they are with re&s;pect to the old. The force of them does not depend upon the particular age of people, any more than it does upon their particular complexion, &s;tature or occu|pation in life. If you are but rea&s;onable, moral agents, the po&s;terity of Adam; and among&s;t tho&s;e, to redeem and &s;ave whom Chri&s;t came into the world, all the&s;e argu|ments &s;tand in full force; whether you are ten, twenty or fifty years old. You might &s;ay with as much truth and propriety, that it will be time enough for a &s;lender man to be religious, when he is become corpulent; for a fair One, when he has been burnt a few years under the equator, or for an AEthiopian, when he has in part changed his &s;kin; as &s;ay, that it will be time enough for you to be &s;o|ber-minded, when you are more advanced in years.</P>
<P>BUT to be a little more particular here: If to be truly religious, is in it&s;elf a rea&s;onable thing, as has been &s;hewn; then it is &s;o for all men at all times, in every &s;ea&s;on of life, even from childhood to old age. You do, in effect, your&s;elves acknowledge religion to be founded in nature and rea&s;on, by re&s;olving to practi&s;e it hereafter, under the notion of its being right, and your duty to do &s;o. For, if it be not rea&s;onable, why will you practi&s;e it
<PB N="315" REF="009440_0330_0F748F10DC067FE0">
at all? Why do you not rather &s;et up a bold re&s;olution at once, again&s;t all virtue and &s;o|briety; and determine in your own minds, that you <HI>never</HI> will fear, love or &s;erve God? This you dare not, you cannot do; becau&s;e you know that you ought in all rea&s;on to love him, and keep his commandments. So that every day and hour of your continuance in &s;in, you mu&s;t be &s;elf-condemned, as acting a part that is contrary to your own rea&s;on. Deny it if you can.</P>
<P>IF &s;obriety, or true religion, be honorable at all, it is &s;o at all times; in youth as well as in age. The world in general, as has been &s;hewn, pays re&s;pect to virtue and religion, under the notion of its being in nature fit, proper and rea&s;onable for mankind in com|mon; not under the notion of its being pro|per only for this or that particular per&s;on, or per&s;ons, of &s;uch or &s;uch an age. If you con|&s;ult your reputation therefore, you mu&s;t re|&s;olve to for&s;ake your vices without delay, and to be &s;ober-minded from this very day: For all the time of your delay, you will ju&s;tly lie under the imputation of folly and wickedne&s;s. And how great a reproach is that!</P>
<P>IF there is any difference, religion is, of the two, more amiable and honorable in the young than in the old. For it is an indication of a mature judgment in that &s;ea&s;on of life, which is &s;o commonly devoted to levity and folly, to vanity and vice. It &s;eems le&s;s prai&s;e-wor|thy in an old man to be wi&s;e and &s;ober, than
<PB N="316" REF="009440_0331_0F748F11960BCC80">
for a young one: Though, on the other hand, vice and folly may &s;eem rather more inexcu&s;able and &s;hameful in the aged, than they are in the young.</P>
<P>IF a virtuous and religious life is, beyond all compari&s;on, the mo&s;t contented and happy one; then the earlier you enter upon &s;uch a life, the better it will be for you; the more peace and comfort, the more real &s;atisfaction and plea&s;ure you will enjoy in life. All the time that you continue &s;trangers to wi&s;dom and virtue, whether longer or &s;horter, you are putting a cheat upon, and defrauding your&s;elves: You deprive your&s;elves of that &s;uperior and &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s, which flows from true religion; and &s;ubject your|&s;elves to the many vexations, mi&s;chiefs, and unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions, which naturally attend folly and vice.</P>
<P>THE &s;ooner you become wi&s;e and vir|tuous, the more &s;erviceable you will be to the world; the better you will fill up your &s;ta|tions in life; the better you will an&s;wer the end of your creation, by doing good to your fellow-mortals. Society will be much more indebted and obliged to you, if you conduct your&s;elves properly from your youth up, than if you begin to do &s;o, only as a kind of <HI>ceremony</HI> at parting, and taking a final leave of it.</P>
<P>ALL the time you continue in the practice of &s;in, you are acting a mo&s;t ungrateful and di&s;ingenuous part towards God, your
<PB N="317" REF="009440_0332_0F748F12099F8040">
Father in heaven, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t who died for you. You are all this time abu&s;ing the divine goodne&s;s and patience; and grieving the holy Spirit; good angels above, and good men below: And al&s;o gratifying your wor&s;t, your mo&s;t implacable enemies, the devil and his angels.</P>
<P>YOU are all this time al&s;o, acting a mo&s;t pre&s;umptuous and audacious, as well as un|grateful part, towards your rightful Sove|reign, the mighty God, the great and only Potentate. For you are all this while in a &s;tate of rebellion again&s;t Him, before who&s;e throne the holy angels veil their faces, and pro&s;trate them&s;elves with the profounde&s;t reve|rence; and at the very thought of whom, tho&s;e apo&s;tate &s;pirits who are in exile from heaven, tremble, and are horribly afraid.&mdash;So that in &s;hort, it &s;eems you have neither the filial love and reverence of the great God, which good angels have; nor &s;o much awe and dread of his di&s;plea&s;ure, as the angels of darkne&s;s. How a&s;toni&s;hing then, is your in|gratitude on one hand, and your audacity on the other; while you continue re&s;olved and fearle&s;s in the violation of God's com|mandments!</P>
<P>REPENTANCE and reformation will, in all probability, be attended with more pain, anxiety and difficulty hereafter, than they would be at pre&s;ent; however you may flat|ter your&s;elves to the contrary. Sin gains &s;trength by habit and cu&s;tom; the longer it
<PB N="318" REF="009440_0333_0F748F12B9155B88">
is continued in, the more is the &s;oul depra|ved, corrupted and en&s;laved thereby. The habits of &s;in are not &s;o ea&s;ily broken off, when they are old and inveterate, as when but newly contracted; as a confirmed tyran|ny in any nation, is harder to be broken than a novel and recent one. Agreeably whereto it is &s;aid in &s;cripture, <Q>Can the AEthiopian change his &s;kin, or the leopard his &s;pots? Then may ye al&s;o that are accu&s;tomed to do evil, learn to do well.</Q> Which words, tho' they are not de&s;igned to a&s;&s;ert the ab&s;o|lute impo&s;&s;ibility of breaking off inveterate evil habits, do yet very &s;trongly expre&s;s the great and peculiar difficulty of it.</P>
<P>THE earlier you begin to be wi&s;e and vir|tuous, the more honor will, by your means, redound to God and religion. God is glori|fied by them that love and obey him, and or|der their conver&s;ation aright. The &s;ooner therefore any begin to do &s;o, the more they will glorify him. And ought you not, in all rea&s;on, as far as po&s;&s;ible to honor the great and good God, your heavenly Father, who daily loadeth you with his benefits?</P>
<P>THE &s;ooner you begin to be &s;ober-minded, the greater progre&s;s you will make in true wi&s;dom, virtue and holine&s;s; and the greater moral perfection you will have attained to, when your lives &s;hall come to a period. For true religion is in its nature progre&s;&s;ive: It is like the light of the ri&s;ing &s;un; which at fir&s;t only glimmers faintly in the ea&s;t; then over|&s;preads
<PB N="319" REF="009440_0334_0F748F139A616EE8">
the horizon, and "&s;hineth more and more unto the perfect day."</P>
<P>THE &s;ooner you begin to &s;erve God, and your generation according to his will; and the more perfect you are when you come to die in a good old age, the greater will be your reward and honor in the world to come. When all the righteous &s;hall &s;hine forth as the &s;un in the kingdom of their Father; you will appear with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre and glo|ry, proportionably to the degree in which you excelled others on earth, honoured God more, and did more good in the world.</P>
<P>YOU will ob&s;erve, my young brethren, that all the arguments here touched upon, are grounded upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, not only that you may probably, but certainly will be &s;ober-minded hereafter, &s;ome time or other, tho' you &s;hould per&s;evere a number of years longer in the practice of &s;in and folly. They are all &s;trictly conclu&s;ive, even upon this &s;up|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t now remind you, that this &s;uppo&s;ition is at be&s;t a very precarious one. You may have no more di&s;po&s;ition, no more inclination to, no more ta&s;te for, wi&s;dom and virtue in old age, than you have now in your youth. Or rather, your aver&s;ion thereto may probably be increa&s;ed in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ened; tho' you &s;eem to take it for granted, that wi&s;dom and &s;obriety will come of cour&s;e with years and age. This is one of the many de|vices of Satan, of which you ought not to be
<PB N="320" REF="009440_0335_0F748F14390A66D8">
ignorant. You will naturally grow more hardened by continuing in &s;in, as was inti|mated before. God may withdraw tho&s;e re&s;traints, and kind influences of his Spirit, which you now in &s;ome mea&s;ure enjoy; and give you up entirely to your own hearts lu&s;t.&mdash;How many per&s;ons are there who, tho' they had many checks of con&s;cience in youth, and a tenderne&s;s of heart in &s;ome degree; yet, when they come to middle or old age, appear to be quite hardened and &s;tupified; to have lo&s;t almo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of moral good and evil, and are become profane &s;coffers at religion? There are not a few examples of this &s;ort in the world. You &s;ee then, that men do not always grow wi&s;er and better, but often wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e, with years. And what evidence? what rational grounds have you to conclude, that this will not be your own ca&s;e, &s;hould you now in youth &s;tifle the convictions of your own minds; and re|&s;i&s;t and quench the good Spirit of God, which is &s;triving with you? You have no &s;ort of evidence, however confident you may be, that you &s;hall not be thus left of God; as many others <HI>apparently</HI> are.</P>
<P>CONSIDER, in the next place, that while you delay to fear and &s;erve God, you are continually adding to the number of your &s;ins, much too great already! and increa&s;ing your guilt every day you live. For there is no medium betwixt doing right and wrong; betwixt &s;erving God, and &s;erving the devil
<PB N="321" REF="009440_0336_0F748F1543927978">
and your lu&s;ts. If you do not the former, you will do the latter. And be&s;ides; your &s;ins will not only become more numerous, but more aggravated, with your years; be|ing committed again&s;t more light and know|ledge, than tho&s;e of your childhood were.</P>
<P>AGAIN: Con&s;ider, that if you &s;hould die at la&s;t in your &s;ins, in a wicked old age; as is not improbable, if you &s;hould live to be old, your future condemnation will be &s;o much the more aggravated; and your pu|ni&s;hment in the other world proportionably the greater. You are trea&s;uring up wrath to your&s;elves, again&s;t the day of wrath. And the longer you live, if you &s;hould at la&s;t pe|ri&s;h in your &s;ins, the wor&s;e it will be for you. It is &s;aid, not without a particular empha&s;is, that "the &s;inner of an hundred years old, &s;hall be accur&s;ed." In which re&s;|pect, there have doubtle&s;s been many per&s;ons who, in&s;tead of having eventually any cau&s;e for rejoicing that they lived &s;o long, have ra|ther had cau&s;e to wi&s;h that they had been <Q>as an hidden untimely birth; as infants which never &s;aw the light!</Q></P>
<P>YOU will take notice, my young brethren, that every one of the foregoing arguments proceeds upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that you will actually live to be old men! Even taking that for granted, there is not one of them but what is ab&s;olutely conclu&s;ive in favour of being &s;ober-minded in youth. How &s;trong then, is the practical conclu&s;ion which re&s;ults from them all in conjunction!</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="009440_0337_0F748F15B41ADA18">
BUT I mu&s;t now remind you, in the la&s;t place, that the forementioned &s;uppo&s;ition of your living till you are old, is much too fa|vourable for you: It is a precarious, un&s;up|ported hypothe&s;is; &s;uch an one as no per&s;on of the lea&s;t prudence or di&s;cretion would build upon, e&s;pecially when there is &s;uch an intere&s;t at &s;take. Will you boa&s;t your&s;elves of many years to come, or even of to-mor|row, when you "know not what a day may bring forth"? What a &s;trange infatuation is this, however common! How many millions of millions of per&s;ons younger than you, are already numbered with the dead in the du&s;t of the earth, not to ari&s;e again till the&s;e hea|vens are no more? How many of the com|panions of your childhood, of your friends, relations, and perhaps brethren and &s;i&s;ters, born after, are gone before you? (For in this &s;en&s;e, as well as in divers others, "the fir&s;t are often la&s;t, and the la&s;t fir&s;t.") Some of whom were perhaps taken away by a &s;udden violent &s;troke, without previous warning; and who&s;e lives having been among the unclean, it were needle&s;s to &s;ay, that their death was not with the pure and holy, nor their portion with the ble&s;&s;ed. Now, have you any a&s;&s;u|rance that you &s;hall not your&s;elves be thus &s;uddenly &s;natched out of the world, while you are dreaming about being &s;ober-minded twenty or thirty, forty or fifty years hence; when you have &s;ufficiently fatigued your&s;elves in the &s;ervice of Satan and your lu&s;ts! Has

the God of your lives?&mdash;has He in who&s;e hand your breath is, and who&s;e are all your ways, ever told you, that du&s;t and worms &s;hall not cover you before grey hairs appear upon you? You may be in the place of tor|ment many years before the time comes, which you allot for reformation!</P>
<P>NOT one of you, however healthy, &s;trong and flouri&s;hing, tho' like a green bay tree in its prime, has any &s;ecurity that he &s;hall not be &s;uddenly cut down. For behold, even "now the axe is laid to the root of the trees;" and it cannot be long before "every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and ca&s;t into the fire." Young and tender <HI>&s;applings</HI> fall more ea&s;ily than trees come to maturity, and to a proper con&s;i&s;tence of parts: A &s;mall &s;troke may lay them level with the earth. Yea, they may be mown down as the gra&s;s, and the flower of the field, "which to day is, and to-morrow is ca&s;t in|to the oven:" Nor are they &s;o green, or full of &s;ap, but that a fire may be found fierce e|nough to burn them&mdash;In the language of the book of Job, "Man that is born of a woman, is of few days&mdash;He cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down: He fleeth al&s;o as a &s;hadow, and continueth not." In the language of Mo&s;es, we are "like gra&s;s which groweth up. In the morning it flouri&s;heth, and grow|eth up; in the evening it is cut down and withereth.&mdash;We &s;pend our years as a tale that is told." In the language of David,
<PB N="324" REF="009440_0339_0F748F18553C95A0">
"every man at his be&s;t e&s;tate, is altogether vanity." In the language of Solomon, "What&s;oever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work&mdash;in the grave whither thou goe&s;t&mdash;For man al&s;o knoweth not his time; as the fi&s;hes that are taken in an evil net," &amp;c. And again, "Re|member now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not."&mdash;In the language of St. Peter, "All fle&s;h is as gra&s;s, and all the glory of man, as the flower of gra&s;s: The gra&s;s withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away; but the word of the Lord endureth forever." And in the words of St. James, well worthy the attention of all, and particularly of tho&s;e of you, who are warmly engaged in worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, trafic and merchandize; "Go to now, ye that &s;ay, To-day or to-morrow, we will go into &s;uch a city, and continue there a year, and buy and &s;ell, and get gain: whereas ye know not what &s;hall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour that appear|eth for a little time, and then vani&s;heth away."</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee then, my young brethren, the infinite importance, not only in general of being &s;ober-minded, but of being &s;o imme|diately, without any delay; as for many o|ther rea&s;ons that have been mentioned, &s;o particularly for this, that you have no &s;ecu|rity for another day, hour or moment. This being the ca&s;e, how extremely fooli&s;h and dangerous is it to depend upon living many

O that you were all wi&s;e; that you under&s;tood this, and duly con&s;idered your latter end!

<P>IT may be u&s;eful to you, my young bre|thren, if I here &s;ubjoin &s;ome &s;hort coun&s;els and cautions of a mixed nature; tho' divers of them may perhaps be near akin to &s;ome that are contained in the foregoing di&s;cour&s;es; and others only prudential. And,</P>

2. GIVE your minds and attention chiefly to plain things in religion; to the obvious doctrines and duties of it; &s;uch as are indi&s;pu|table, and &s;uch as almo&s;t all chri&s;tians are, and ever were agreed in. For the&s;e are, without doubt, of the greate&s;t importance; and on the belief and practice of them, more e&s;peci|ally, does your pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s depend. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the all-wi&s;e, good and merciful God, has made the eternal &s;alvation of men depend upon niceties; upon ab&s;tru&s;e &s;peculations, or things difficult to be under&s;tood. Hi&s;tory informs us that Caligula, one of the mo&s;t cruel and infamous of the Roman Emperors, commanded his e|dicts, laws and orders to be written in &s;uch &s;mall, ob&s;cure characters, and then fixed up &s;o high, that it was next to impo&s;&s;ible for people in general to read and under&s;tand them, that they might know his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure. This he is &s;aid to have done, on purpo&s;e to en&s;nare his &s;ubjects; that he might have an opportunity to embrue his hands in their blood as malefactors, under color of law and ju&s;tice. It is &s;aid of Ba&s;ilides, another infamous tyrant, that he would often impo&s;e the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and impracticable commands on his &s;ubjects; for example, that he would require One to bring him a pint, or large quantity of his &s;weat in a ve&s;&s;el, on a cold fro&s;ty morning; and another, to bring him a great number of fleas chained together in a particular manner, at a &s;ea&s;on,
<PB N="328" REF="009440_0343_0F748F1B96C66608">
or in a country, wherein no fleas were to be found; and the like: And then put them to death for di&s;obedience. It is &s;aid of Pro|cru&s;tes, an infamous robber and petty tyrant, that he would, with great apparent kindne&s;s, conde&s;cention and humanity, invite people to lodge at his palace, or ca&s;tle: And then cut off the feet and legs of &s;ome who were too tall, and &s;tretch and torture others who were too &s;hort, to make them ju&s;t as long as the bed prepared for them. Now, the repre&s;en|tations often given us of God's dealings with men, &s;uppo&s;e him to be really no better than an <HI>almighty</HI> Caligula, Ba&s;ilides or Procru&s;tes; or rather, to have all their particular bad qualities, and peculiar caprices united in him&s;elf. Thus do &s;ome, tho' I hope igno|rantly, bla&s;pheme the all-wi&s;e, good and mer|ciful God! Be all &s;uch impious conceptions of him far from you, as it is from the Almighty that he &s;hould do wickedly, or pervert ju&s;tice and judgment! You may be a&s;&s;ured that all of you, who &s;incerely de&s;ire to know and to do his will, in order to your eternal happine&s;s, may both know and do it, as far as is nece&s;&s;ary to that end, by means of the light, help and grace which he affords to them that &s;eek him. The truth and will of God, as far as your &s;alvation is concerned in knowing it, is not ob&s;curely or darkly, but clearly revealed; &s;o that "he that runs may read:" And the path of life, to an hone&s;t mind, is &s;o plain, that "the way-faring men,
<PB N="329" REF="009440_0344_0F748F1BF7B258B8">
tho' fools, can hardly err therein." There are however, doubtle&s;s, &s;ome things in the word of God, "hard to be under&s;tood." Neither, when I advi&s;e you to attend chiefly to tho&s;e that are plain and ea&s;y, do I mean that you &s;hould not, as far as may be, ac|quaint your&s;elves with the whole truth re|vealed; "that ye may &s;tand perfect, and complete in the will of God."</P>

It is &s;eldom that any good, and of|ten that much mi&s;chief, comes of this kind of controver&s;y; whether you call it playing, fencing or fighting: And, to "&s;hew out of a good conver&s;ation your works with meek|ne&s;s of wi&s;dom," will be much more to your honor and advantage, than the greate&s;t re|putation you can po&s;&s;ibly obtain in this way.</P>

Occa&s;ionally to open your minds freely, and to di&s;cour&s;e upon them with people of candor and moderation, whom you know; not in the controver&s;ial way, for vanity or victory, but merely for the &s;ake of receiving or giving information: This, I &s;ay, may be at once ve|ry agreeable and edifying to you.

<PB N="332" REF="009440_0347_0F748F1F06198600">
Would you think either to convince &s;uch men, "foaming out their own &s;hame," or even to allay their intemperate heat, clamor and railing, by rea&s;oning with them;&mdash;by &s;ober argument!&mdash;At lea&s;t, fir&s;t try your talent at rea&s;oning &s;ome other way. For example; try it fir&s;t on a whirlwind; then on the cata|racts of Niagara, and next on the fiery erup|tions of Ve&s;uvius, Stromboli and AEtna. If the experiment &s;ucceeds; if you can &s;u&s;|pend the fury and rage of all the&s;e, by the force of your rea&s;oning; you will then have &s;ome encouragement to make trial of it upon &s;uch men as the foaming enthu&s;ia&s;t, and the flaming bigot; otherwi&s;e it is be&s;t for you to leave them to God, and endeavour to be, and keep <HI>&s;ober</HI> your&s;elves.</P>
<P N="7">7. AVOID all o&s;tentation in religion. Do nothing from a &s;pirit of vain-glory; e&s;pecial|ly nothing that has any relation to religion; but every thing, in lowline&s;s of mind. Nei|ther affect to appear righteous unto men; but endeavour to do your duty in all re&s;pects, as in the &s;ight of God who trieth your hearts. <Q>Be not righteous over-much; neither make your&s;elves over-wi&s;e: why &s;hould you de|&s;troy your&s;elves?</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl. VII. 17.</NOTE> Every thing that is &s;hewy, affected and o&s;tentations in religion; or done with an apparent de&s;ign to make people think the doer very &s;crupulous, con|&s;cientious, and eminently pious, is highly di&s;gu&s;tful to per&s;ons of true wi&s;dom and pe|netration;
<PB N="333" REF="009440_0348_0F748F1F75DC44E0">
and, which is far more, highly offen&s;ive to God, who dwelleth with, and delighteth in, them that are of a lowly, humble and contrite &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="8">8. ON the other hand, beware of fal&s;e &s;hame and mode&s;ty; a common vice, and none of the lea&s;t. People are often a&s;hamed of their duty; &s;ometimes, only le&s;t fools &s;hould laugh at and deride them for doing it; and &s;ometimes, perhaps, le&s;t others &s;hould think they have not &s;hame and mode&s;ty enough. To be a&s;hamed, in any ca&s;e, of what is right and fit to be done, and from that principle to omit it, is real impudence, and of the wor&s;t kind; becau&s;e it is offending God, through ba&s;hfulne&s;s with regard to man. To be &s;ure, never be a&s;hamed of your Saviour, "or of his words;" but confe&s;s both before men on all proper occa&s;ions; le&s;t he &s;hould al&s;o be a|&s;hamed of you, when he cometh in the glory of his Father, with the holy angels.</P>
<P N="9">9. REST not &s;atisfied with any profe&s;&s;ion of religion, or in any &s;uperficial reformation of manners: Re&s;t in nothing &s;hort of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, thro' faith that worketh by love, and which connotes that new birth, and new creature, &s;poken of in&s;cripture. Every thing &s;hort of this, will leave you de&s;titute of chri&s;|tian &s;obriety; and therefore, in a &s;tate of &s;in, guilt and death. Be&s;ides: Unfeigned faith in Chri&s;t as the redeemer of &s;inners, purity of heart, and a &s;upreme love to God, are ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to your having any true de|light

in his &s;ervice, and enjoying the comforts of religion, or of the Holy Gho&s;t, in this world. Religion will be rather a burthen, an unea&s;y re&s;traint to you, than your happine&s;s and delight, if you have no more of it than the form. She be&s;tows not her comforts, her divine joys, but on them that &s;incerely love her, embrace her with their whole heart, and yield them&s;elves up unre&s;ervedly to her heavenly influence and power. So long as your hearts are divided betwixt God and the world, they will be mi&s;erably torn and tor|tured; you will be in doubts, in fears and darkne&s;s. But once give up all; once re|nounce every thing that &s;tands in competition with God, and re&s;olve to follow the Lamb "whither &s;oever he goeth;" then will you indeed find re&s;t unto your &s;ouls. Your eye being thus &s;ingle, your whole body &s;hall be full of light; your &s;ouls, of heaven|ly peace, hope and comfort.</P>
<P N="10">10. KEEP a particular watch and guard upon your <HI>own</HI> iniquity; upon the &s;in that mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;ets you, upon your con&s;tituti|onal, and mo&s;t beloved lu&s;t. All people in general have, either originally from nature, or from the circum&s;tances of their educa|tion, employment, or &s;tation in life, &s;ome &s;uch favourite lu&s;t or pa&s;&s;ion; which is to them as a right hand, or a right eye: They know not how to part with it, till they are born of the Spirit; &s;o dear it is to them. And even then, it is not always &s;o far con|quered

as to be upon the &s;ame level with o|ther vices. The dethroned tyrant, that once reign'd without controul, lo&s;es not all his power at once; but often &s;truggles to regain his former empire in the heart. In &s;ome per|&s;ons this tyrant is anger, in others envy, in others avarice, in others vanity or pride, in others uncleanne&s;s, in others intemperance in meat and drink; and &s;o on. And whatever your own predominant pa&s;&s;ion is, you are re|&s;pectively to keep a particular eye upon it. Till you have in &s;ome good mea&s;ure got the ma&s;tery of it, you are not to imagine your|&s;elves chri&s;tians: This is your particular trial, and a touch-&s;tone of your &s;incerity towards God.</P>
<P>BUT to draw near to the conclu&s;ion of this di&s;cour&s;e and &s;ubject together: I have, in the &s;implicity of my heart, been taking con&s;iderable pains to give you &s;uch in&s;truc|tions, coun&s;els and warnings; and to lay before you &s;uch motives to &s;obriety, as are agreeable to the word of God; all, with a &s;in|cere view to your temporal and eternal good. I have borne it upon my own mind all along, that I am accountable to God for whatever I deliver to you as his word and will, and your duty to believe and practi&s;e: And that, if I wilfully or knowingly deliver to you any thing contrary thereto, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men; I do it at the utmo&s;t peril of my own perdition. Let me remind you, on the other hand, my young
<PB N="336" REF="009440_0351_0F748F21C0815178">
brethren, that you are al&s;o accountable to God, our common Sovereign, for the recep|tion which you give to his word and com|mandments, made known to you; and, that if you wilfully di&s;regard or neglect them, your peril will be equally great. I therefore be|&s;eech, as well as exhort you, to be &s;ober-minded. You will, probably, be either the better or the wor&s;e in the end, for my di&s;|cour&s;es to you upon this &s;ubject: Which of them it &s;hall be, depends, under God, upon your&s;elves; upon your remembring and ob|&s;erving, or forgetting and neglecting, what has been &s;aid to you agreeably to the holy &s;criptures. And, from the general, and ap|parently &s;erious attention which you have gi|ven, there &s;eems to be more ground to hope the former, than to fear the latter: God grant, that the event may confirm, and eter|nally ju&s;tify the&s;e hopes!</P>
<P>BEFORE Him; the great, the all-knowing, impartial and almighty Judge of all, both you the hearers, and I the &s;peaker, mu&s;t e'er long appear, to give an account of our&s;elves re|&s;pectively. We &s;hall all, at the appointed time, appear before the tribunal of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: For God hath "appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world in righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given a&s;&s;urance unto all men, in that he hath rai&s;ed him from the dead." I am certain, that in that great day, I &s;hall not be condemned by him for any wilful perver|&s;ion of his go&s;pel, either in my di&s;cour&s;es on
<PB N="337" REF="009440_0352_0F748F2275A68AF8">
this, or on any other &s;ubject; my own con|&s;cience bearing me witne&s;s in the Holy Gho&s;t, that in this re&s;pect at lea&s;t, I am innocent; clear from the blood of you and all men, whether old or young. See, my beloved brethren, See that you give &s;uch a reception to the real, the undoubted doctrines and pre|cepts of the go&s;pel, that you may, in re&s;pect of your own <HI>practice,</HI> have the like comfor|table witne&s;s of your con&s;cience, and bold|ne&s;s in the day of judgment; le&s;t, otherwi&s;e, you &s;hould be condemned with the world.

Glorious will be your re|compence of reward at la&s;t, if you believe the word of God, and keep it.</P>

<P>LET me conclude with expre&s;&s;ing the &s;en|timents and de&s;ires of my heart, re&s;pecting both you and my&s;elf, in a &s;hort prayer to Him that heareth prayer; as follows.</P>
<P>O THOU, of whom, and thro' whom, and to whom are all things; the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named! O, graci|ou&s;ly behold the&s;e young men before thee; from the womb ignorant of, and therefore e&s;tranged from thee: But yet thy offspring; formed by thy hand, animated by thy breath, and enlightened with a ray from the fountain of light in thee; born under the common law of mortality, thro' the offence of One, and naturally &s;ubject to the bondage of corruption; born to die in a few days, and yet to live for|ever; encompa&s;&s;ed always with thy pre&s;ence, upheld by thy power, and living only in and by thee.</P>
<P>GREAT Creator and Father of all! who de&s;pi&s;e&s;t not the work of thine own hands; Thou who did&s;t fa&s;hion them &s;o wonderfully in the womb, and take them from it to behold the light! even thou ha&s;t al&s;o nouri&s;hed them and brought them up as children, &s;ince they fir&s;t hung upon their mothers brea&s;ts. Thou ha&s;t delivered them from many evils, and
<PB N="339" REF="009440_0354_0F748F24D1D28000">
&s;hielded them from unnumber'd dangers, thro' the feeble &s;tates of infancy and childhood. Thou, on whom all eyes wait, who heare&s;t the young ravens when they cry, and before whom not a &s;parrow is forgotten: Thou ha&s;t &s;upplied their natural wants from thy &s;tores and trea&s;ures, with a bountiful, a paternal hand; and made&s;t provi&s;ion for their deli|verance from &s;in and death, and for their eter|nal happine&s;s, even before thou gave&s;t them their being. In the fulne&s;s of time, according to thy gracious promi&s;e of old, thou did&s;t &s;end forth thy Son, made and born of a wo|man; who, by thy grace, hath ta&s;ted death for every man, to redeem them that were under the law; and that we &s;inners of the gentiles might al&s;o receive the adoption of &s;ons. From children they have had an op|portunity to know the holy &s;criptures, which te&s;tify of thy Son, and which are able to make them wi&s;e unto &s;alvation, thro' faith which is in him.</P>
<P>O RIGHTEOUS Father! they have indeed erred from thy ways; they have &s;inned, they have rebelled again&s;t thee. O give them now repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth which is after godline&s;s. May they know thee the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent, to the obtaining life eternal. Wherein they have erred from thy righteous paths, forgive, O mo&s;t merciful Father! forgive them, thro' the blood of the Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world.
<PB N="340" REF="009440_0355_0F748F2576F605C8">
Remember not again&s;t them the &s;ins of their youth; for childhood and youth are vanity. Father forgive them; for they knew not what they did! Thou con&s;idere&s;t their frame, thou remembere&s;t that they are du&s;t; and art not &s;trict to mark iniquity. Thou ha&s;t &s;aid by the mouth of thine holy apo&s;tles, that thou wilt have all men to be &s;aved; and art not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come unto repentance; that they may receive the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, thro' Him that died for all, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, that he might bring us to God; and who is able to &s;ave them unto the uttermo&s;t that come unto God by him, &s;eeing he ever liveth to make interce&s;&s;ion for them.</P>
<P>O HOLY Father! may the&s;e young men be &s;anctified through thy truth; thy word is truth. Clean&s;e them throughly from their &s;ins, from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, from all filthi|ne&s;s of the fle&s;h and &s;pirit, in the pure, the hallowed fountain which thou ha&s;t opened. May they be holy, and without blame before thee in love, being followers of thee as dear children the remainder of their days on earth; that they may be heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom thou ha&s;t ap|pointed heir of all things.</P>
<P>O THOU who wa&s;t, and art, and art to come; the &s;ame from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting! behold, thou ha&s;t made their days as an hand|breadth, and their age is as nothing before thee. Cau&s;e them therefore, who&s;e life is as

<P>FATHER of lights, with whom there is no variablene&s;s, neither &s;hadow of turning; E|ternal Source of truth and love! thy unwor|thy &s;ervant hath declared thy love and thy truth unto them, that they might both know and love thee.

<P>IN that great day, therefore, O my God! when the &s;tars of heaven &s;hall fall to the earth, even as a fig-tree &s;haketh her untimely figs, when &s;he is &s;haken of a mighty wind; when the heavens &s;hall depart as a &s;croll when it is rolled together, and every moun|tain and i&s;land &s;hall be moved out of their places; when the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bond-man, and every free-man; when all who have killed, per&s;ecuted, or maliciou&s;ly condemned the ju&s;t; when all who have re|jected and di&s;obeyed thy &s;acred word, or knowingly perverted it, thro' the love or fear of this pre&s;ent world, &s;hall hide them&s;elves in
