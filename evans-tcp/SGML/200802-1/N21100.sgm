<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>OF all kinds of &s;atire, there is none &s;o entertaining and univer&s;ally improving, as that which is intro|duced, as it were occa&s;ionally, in the cour&s;e of an inte|re&s;ting &s;tory, which brings every incident home to life; and, by repre&s;enting familiar &s;cenes in an uncommon and amu&s;ing point of view, inve&s;ts them with all the graces of novelty, while nature is appealed to in every parti|cular.</P>
<P>The reader gratifies his curio&s;ity, in pur&s;uing the ad|ventures of a per&s;on in who&s;e favour he is prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; he e&s;pou&s;es his cau&s;e, he &s;ympathizes with him in his di&s;|tre&s;s, his indignation is heated again&s;t the authors of his calamity; the humane pa&s;&s;ions are inflamed; the contra&s;t between dejected virtue, and in&s;ulting vice, appears with greater aggravation, and every impre&s;&s;ion having a dou|ble force on the imagination, the memory retains the cir|cum&s;tance, and the heart improves by the example. The attention is not tired with a bare catalogue of cha|racters, but agreeably diverted with all the variety of in|vention; and the vici&s;&s;itudes of life appear in their pecu|liar circum&s;tances, opening an ample field for wit and hu|mour.</P>
<P>Romance, no doubt, owes its origin to ignorance, vanity, and &s;uper&s;tition. In the dark ages of the world, when a man had rendered him&s;elf famous for wi&s;dom or valour, his family and adherents availed them&s;elves of his &s;uperior qualities, magnified his virtues, and repre|&s;ented his character and per&s;on as &s;acred and &s;upernatural. The vulgar ea&s;ily &s;wallowed the bait, implored his pro|tection, and yielded the tribute of homage and prai&s;e, even to adoration; his exploits were handed down to po&s;terity with a thou&s;and exaggerations; they were repeated as incitements to virtue; divine honours were paid, and altars erected to his memory, for the en|couragement of tho&s;e who attempted to imitate his exam|ple;
<PB N="iv" REF="027715_0003_0FD5EB4066529BA0">
and hence aro&s;e the heathen mythology, which is no other than a collection of extravagant romances.&mdash;As learning advanced, and genius received cultivation, the&s;e &s;tories were embelli&s;hed with the graces of poetry; that they might the better recommend them&s;elves to the attention, they were &s;ung in public, at fe&s;tivals, for the in&s;truction and delight of the audience, and rehear&s;ed before battle, as incentives to deeds of glory. Thus tragedy and the epic mu&s;e were born, and, in the pro|gre&s;s of ta&s;te, arrived at perfection.&mdash;It is no wonder, that the ancients could not reli&s;h a &s;able in pro&s;e, after they had &s;een &s;o many remarkable events celebrated in ver&s;e by their be&s;t poets; we therefore find no romance among them during the aera of their excellence, unle&s;s the Cyropoedia of Xenophon may be &s;o called: and it was not till arts and &s;ciences began to revive, after the irruption of the Barbarians into Europe, that any thing of this kind appeared. But when the minds of men were debauched by the impo&s;ition of prie&s;tcraft to the mo&s;t ab&s;urd pitch of credulity, the authors of romance aro&s;e, and lo&s;ing &s;ight of probability, filled their performances with the mo&s;t mon&s;trous hyperboles. If they could not equal the ancient poets in point of genius, they were re|&s;olved to excel them in fiction, and apply to the wonder rather than to the judgment of their readers. Accord|ingly they brought necromany to their aid, and in&s;tead of &s;upporting the character of their heroes by dignity of &s;entiment and practice, di&s;tingui&s;hed them by their bodily &s;trength, activity, and extravagance of behaviour. Al|though nothing could be more ludicrous and unnatural, than the figures they drew, they did not want patrons and admirers, and the world actually began to be infected with the &s;pirit of knight-errantry, when Cervantes, by an inimitable piece of ridicule, reformed the ta&s;te of mankind, repre&s;enting chivalry in the right point of view, and converting romance to purpo&s;es far more u&s;eful and entertaining, by making it a&s;&s;ume the &s;ock, and point out the follies of ordinary life.</P>
<P>The &s;ame method has been practi&s;ed by other Spani&s;h and French authors, and by none more &s;ucce&s;sfully than by Mon&s;. Le Sage, who, in his Adventures of Gil Blas, has de&s;cribed the knavery and foibles of life with infinite

humour and &s;agacity. The following &s;heets I have mo|delled on his plan, taking the liberty, however, to di&s;ler from him in the execution, where I thought his particular &s;ituations were uncommon and extravagant, or peculiar to the country in which the &s;cene is laid. The di&s;graces of Gil Blas are, for the mo&s;t part, &s;uch as rather excite mirth than compa&s;&s;ion; he him&s;elf laughs at them, and his tran&s;itions from di&s;tre&s;s to happine&s;s, or at lea&s;t ea&s;e, are &s;o &s;udden, that neither the reader has time to pity him, nor him&s;elf to be acquainted with affliction. This conduct, in my opinion, not only deviates from proba|bility, but prevents that generous indignation, which ought to animate the reader again&s;t the &s;ordid and vicious di&s;po&s;ition of the world.</P>
<P>I have attempted to repre&s;ent mode&s;t merit &s;truggling with every difficulty, to which a friendle&s;s orphan is ex|po&s;ed from his own want of experience, as well as from the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, envy, malice, and ba&s;e indifference of man|kind. To &s;ecure a favourable prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I have allow|ed him the advantage of birth and education, which, in the &s;eries of his mi&s;fortunes, will, I hope, engage the ingenuous more warmly in his behalf; and though I fore|&s;ee, that &s;ome people will be offended at the mean &s;cenes in which he is involved, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, the judicious will not only perceive the nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;cribing tho&s;e &s;ituations, to which he mu&s;t of cour&s;e be confined in his low e&s;tate, but al&s;o find entertainment in viewing tho&s;e parts of life, where the humours and pa&s;&s;ions are undi&s;|gui&s;ed by affectation, ceremony, or education, and the whim&s;ical peculiarities of di&s;po&s;ition appear as nature has implanted them. But I believe I need not trouble my&s;elf in vindicating a practice authori&s;ed by the be&s;t writers in this way, &s;ome of whom I have already named.</P>
<P>Every intelligent reader will at fir&s;t &s;ight perceive, I have not deviated from nature in the facts, which are all true in the main, although the circum&s;tances are altered and di&s;gui&s;ed to avoid per&s;onal &s;atire.</P>
<P>It now remains to give my rea&s;ons for making the chief per&s;onage of this work a North-Briton, which are chiefly the&s;e: I could at a &s;mall expence be&s;tow on him &s;uch education as I thought the dignity of his birth and character required, which could not po&s;&s;ibly be obtained
<PB N="vi" REF="027715_0005_0FD5EB47497D3AD0">
in England by &s;uch &s;lender means as the nature of my plan would afford. In the next place, I could repre&s;ent &s;implicity of manners in a remote part of the kingdom, with more propriety than in any place near the capital; and la&s;tly, the di&s;po&s;ition of the Scots, addicted to travel|ling, ju&s;tifies my conduct in deriving an adventurer from that country.</P>
<P>That the delicate reader may not be offended at the unmeaning oaths which proceed from the mouths of &s;ome per&s;ons in the&s;e memoirs, I beg leave to premi&s;e, that I imagined nothing could more effectually expo&s;e the ab|&s;urdity of &s;uch mi&s;erable expletives, than a natural and verbal repre&s;entation of the di&s;cour&s;e in which they occur.</P>

<HEAD>APOLOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG painter, indulging a vein of plea&s;antry, &s;ketched a kind of conver&s;ation-piece, repre&s;enting a bear, an owl, a monkey, and an a&s;s, and to render it more &s;trik|ing, humorous, and moral, di&s;tingui&s;hed every figure by &s;ome emblem of human life.</P>
<P>Bruin was exhibited in the garb and attitude of an old toothle&s;s. drunken &s;oldier; the owl perched upon the Handle of a coffee-pot, with &s;pectacles on his no&s;e, &s;eemed to contemplate a new&s;paper; and the a&s;s, ornamented with a huge tie-wig, (which, however, could not con|ceal his long ears,) &s;at for his picture to the monkey, who appeared with the implements of painting. This whim&s;ical groupe afforded &s;ome mirth, and met with general approbation, until &s;ome mi&s;chievous wag hint|ed, that the whole was a lampoon upon the friends of the performer; an in&s;inuation which was no &s;ooner cir|culated, than tho&s;e very people who applauded it before began to be alarmed, and even to fancy them&s;elves &s;ig|nified by the &s;everal figures of the piece.</P>
<P>Among others a worthy per&s;onage in years, who had &s;er|ved in the army with reputation, being incen&s;ed at the &s;uppo&s;ed outrage, repaired to the lodgings of the paint|er, and finding him at home, <Q>Hark ye, Mr. Mon|key,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I have a good mind to convince you that, though the bear has lo&s;t his teeth, he re|tains his paws, and that he is not &s;o drunk but he can perceive your impertinence&mdash;'Sblood! Sir, that toothle&s;s jaw is a damn'd &s;candalous libel&mdash;but don't you imagine me &s;o chop-fallen as not to be able to chew the cud of re&s;entment.</Q>&mdash;Here he was inter|rupted by the arrival of a learned phy&s;ician, who ad|vancing to the culprit with fury in his a&s;pect, exclaim|ed, <Q>Suppo&s;e the augmentation of the a&s;s's ears &s;hould prove the diminution of the baboon's&mdash;nay, &s;eek not to prevaricate; for, by the beard of Ae&s;culapius! there is not one hair in this periwig that will not &s;tand up in judgment to convict thee of per&s;onal

abu&s;e&mdash;Do but ob&s;erve, captain, how this pitiful little fellow has copied the very curls&mdash;the colour, indeed, is different; but then the form and foretop are quite &s;imilar.</Q> While he thus remon&s;trated in a &s;train of vociferation, a venerable &s;enator entered, and waddling up to the delinquent, "Jackanapes!" cried he, <Q>I will now let thee &s;ee I can read &s;omething el&s;e than a new&s;paper, and that without the help of &s;pec|tacles&mdash;here is your own note of hand, &s;irrah, for money, which, if I had not advanced, you your&s;elf would have re&s;embled an owl, in not daring to &s;hew your face by day, you ungrateful, &s;landerous knave!</Q></P>
<P>In vain the a&s;toni&s;hed painter declared, that he had no intention to give offence, or to characteri&s;e particular per&s;ons; they affirmed the re&s;emblance was too palpa|ble to be overlooked; they taxed him with in&s;olence, malice, and ingratitude; and, their clamours being overheard by the public, the captain was a bear, the doctor an a&s;s, and the &s;enator an owl to his dying day.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tian reader, I be&s;eech thee in the bowels of the Lord, remember this example while thou art employed in the peru&s;al of the following &s;heets, and &s;eek not to appro|priate to thy&s;elf that which equally belongs to five hundred different people. If thou &s;hould&s;t meet with a character that reflects thee in &s;ome ungracious parti|cular, keep thy own coun&s;el; con&s;ider that one feature makes not a face, and that though thou art per|haps di&s;tingui&s;hed by a bottle no&s;e, twenty of thy neighbours may be in the &s;ame predicament.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of my birth and parentage.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I WAS born in the northern part of this united kind|dom, in the hou&s;e of my grandfather, a gentleman of con&s;iderable fortune and influence, who had on many occa&s;ions &s;ignalized him&s;elf in behalf of his country, and was remarkable for his abilities in the law, which he exerci&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s, in the &s;tation of a judge, particularly again&s;t beggars, for whom he had a &s;ingular aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>My father (his younge&s;t &s;on) falling in love with a poor relation, who lived with the old gentleman in quality of hou&s;e-keeper, e&s;pou&s;ed her privately; and I was the fir&s;t fruit of that marriage. During her pregnancy, a dream di&s;compo&s;ed my mother &s;o much, that her hu&s;band, tired with her importunity, at la&s;t con&s;ulted a Highland &s;eer, who&s;e favourable interpretation he would have &s;ecured before-hand by a bribe, but found him incorruptible. She dreamed &s;he war delivered of a tennis-ball, which the de|vil (who, to her great &s;urpri&s;e, acted the part of a mid-wife) &s;truck &s;o forcibly with a racket, that is di&s;appeared in an in&s;tant; and &s;he was for &s;ome time incon&s;olable for the lo&s;s of her offspring, when all of a &s;udden &s;he beheld it return with equal violence, and enter the earth, beneath
<PB N="2" REF="027715_0009_0FD5EB4F5ABA9EF0">
her feet, whence immediately &s;prung up a goodly tree, co|vered with blo&s;&s;oms, the &s;cent of which operated &s;o &s;trong|ly on her nerves, that &s;he awoke. The attentive &s;age, after &s;ome deliberation, a&s;&s;ured my parents, that their fir&s;t born would be a great traveller; that he would undergo many dangers and difficulties, and at la&s;t return to his na|tive land, where he would flouri&s;h in happine&s;s and repu|tation. How truly this was foretold, will appear in the &s;equel. It was not long before &s;ome officious per&s;on in|formed my grandfather of certain familiarities that pa&s;&s;ed between his &s;on and hou&s;e-keeper, which alarmed him &s;o much, that, a few days after, he told my father it was high time for him to think of &s;ettling, and that he had provided a match for him, to which he could in ju&s;tice have no objections. My father, finding it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to conceal his &s;ituation much longer, frankly owned what he had done, and excu&s;ed him&s;elf for not ha|ving a&s;ked the con&s;ent of his father, by &s;aying, he knew it would have been to no purpo&s;e, and that, had his in|clination been known, my grandfather might have taken &s;uch mea&s;ures as would have effectually put the gratifica|tion of it out of his power: he added, that no exceptions could be taken to his wife's virtue, birth, beauty, and good &s;en&s;e; and, as for fortune, it was beneath his care. The old gentleman, who kept all his pa&s;&s;ions except one, in excellent order, heard him to an end with great tem|per, and then calmly a&s;ked, how he propo&s;ed to maintain him&s;elf and &s;pou&s;e? He replied, he could be in no danger of wanting, while his father's tenderne&s;s remained, which he and his wife would always cultivate with the utmo&s;t veneration; that he was per&s;uaded his allowance would be &s;uitable to the dignity and circum&s;tances of his family, and to the provi&s;ion already made for his brothers and &s;i&s;ters, who were happily &s;ettled under his protection. <Q>Your brothers and &s;i&s;ters.</Q> &s;aid my grandfather, <Q>did not think it beneath them to con&s;ult me in an affair of &s;uch importance as matrimony; neither, I &s;uppo&s;e, would you have omitted that piece of duty, had you not &s;ome &s;ecret fund in re&s;erve; to the comforts of which I leave you, with a de&s;ire that you will this night &s;eek out an|other habitation for your&s;elf and wife, whither, in a &s;hort time, I will &s;end you an account of the expence I
<PB N="3" REF="027715_0010_0FD5EB53EECC3980">
have been at in your education, with a view of being reimbur&s;ed. Sir, you have made the grand tour&mdash;you are a polite gentleman&mdash;a very pretty gentleman&mdash;I wi&s;h you a great deal of joy, and am your very humble &s;ervant.</Q> So &s;aying, he left my father in a &s;ituation ea&s;ily imagined. However, he did not long he&s;itate; for, being perfectly well acquainted with his father's di&s;po&s;i|tion, he did not doubt that he was glad of this pretence to get rid of him; and, his re&s;olves being invariable as the laws of the Medes and Per&s;ians, he knew it would be to no purpo&s;e to attempt him by prayers and entreaties; &s;o, without any farther application, he betook him&s;elf, with his di&s;con&s;olate bed-fellow, to a farm-hou&s;e, where an old &s;ervant of his mother dwelt; there they remained &s;ome time in a &s;ituation but ill adapted to the elegance of their de&s;ires and tenderne&s;s of their love; which, never|thele&s;s, my father cho&s;e to endure, rather than to &s;upplicate an unnatural and inflexible parent: but my mother, fore&s;ee|ing the inconveniences to which &s;he mu&s;t have been ex|po&s;ed, had &s;he been delivered in this place, (and her preg|nancy was very far advanced,) without communicating her de&s;ign to her hu&s;band, went in di&s;gui&s;e to the hou&s;e of my grandfather, hoping that her tears and condition would move him to compa&s;&s;ion, and reconcile him to an event which was now irrevocably pa&s;t. She found means to de|ceive the &s;ervants, and was introduced as an unfortunate lady, who wanted to complain of &s;ome matrimonial grie|vances, it being my grandfather's particular province to decide in all ca&s;es of &s;candal. She was accordingly ad|mitted into his pre&s;ence, where, di&s;covering her&s;elf, &s;he fell at his feet, and, in the mo&s;t affecting manner, implo|red his forgivene&s;s, at the &s;ame time repre&s;enting the dan|ger that threatened not only her life, but that of his own grandchild which was about to &s;ee the light. He told her, he was &s;orry that the indi&s;cretion of her and his &s;on had compelled him to make a vow, which put it out of his power to give them any a&s;&s;i&s;tance; that he had already imparted his thoughts on that &s;ubject to her hu&s;band, and was &s;urpri&s;ed that they &s;hould di&s;turb his peace with any farther importunity. This &s;aid, he retired. The violence of my mother's affliction had &s;uch an effect on her con&s;ti|tution, that &s;he was immediately &s;eized with the pains of
<PB N="4" REF="027715_0011_0FD5EB555ED138A0">
child-bed; and had not an old maid-&s;ervant, to whom &s;he was very dear, afforded her pity and a&s;&s;i&s;tance at the ha|zard of incurring my grandfather's di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;he and the innocent fruit of her womb mu&s;t have fallen mi&s;erable vic|tims to his rigour and inhumanity. By the friend&s;hip of this poor woman, &s;he was carried up to a garret, and im|mediately delivered of a man-child, the &s;tory of who&s;e un|fortunate birth he him&s;elf now relates. My father, be|ing informed of what had happened, flew to the embraces of his darling &s;pou&s;e, and, while he loaded his offspring with paternal care&s;&s;es, could not forbear &s;hedding a flood of tears, on beholding the dear partner of his heart (for who&s;e ea&s;e he would have &s;acrificed the trea&s;ures of the ea&s;t) &s;tretched upon a flock-bed, in a mi&s;erable apartment, unable to protect her from the inclemency of the weather. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the old gentleman was igno|rant of what pa&s;&s;ed, though he affected to know nothing of the matter, and pretended to be very much &s;urpri&s;ed when one of his grandchildren by his elde&s;t &s;on decea&s;ed, who lived with him as his heir-apparent, acquainted him with the affair; he determined therefore to ob&s;erve no me|dium, but immediately (on the third day after her deli|very) &s;ent her a peremptory order to be gone, and turned off the &s;ervant who had pre&s;erved her life. This behaviour &s;o exa&s;perated my father, that he had recour&s;e to the mo&s;t dreadful imprecations, and on his bare knees implored that Heaven would renounce him, if ever he &s;hould forget or forgive the barbarity of his &s;ire. The injuries which this unhappy mother received from her removal in &s;uch circum|&s;tances, and the want of nece&s;&s;aries where &s;he lodged, to|gether with her grief and anxiety of mind, &s;oon threw her into a langui&s;hing di&s;order, which put an end to her life. My father, who loved her tenderly, was &s;o affected with her death, that he remained &s;ix weeks deprived of his &s;en&s;es; during which time, the people where he lodged carried the infant to the old man, who relented &s;o far, on hearing the melancholy &s;tory of his daughter-in-law's death, and the deplorable condition of his &s;on, as to &s;end the child to nur&s;e; and he ordered my father to be carried home to his hou&s;e, where he &s;oon recovered the u&s;e of his rea&s;on. Whether this hard-hearted judge felt any remor&s;e for his cruel treatment of his &s;on and daughter, or (which
<PB N="5" REF="027715_0012_0FD5EB577139DE20">
is more probable) was afraid his character would &s;uffer in the neighbourhood, he profe&s;&s;ed great &s;orrow for his con|duct to my father, who&s;e delirium was &s;ucceeded by a pro|found melancholy and re&s;erve. At length he di&s;appeared, and, notwith&s;tanding all imaginable inquiry, could not be heard of; a circum&s;tance which confirmed mo&s;t people in the opinion of his having made away with him&s;elf in a fit of de&s;pair. How I under&s;tood the particulars of my birth, will appear in the cour&s;e of the&s;e memoirs.</P>

<P>I grow up&mdash;am hated by my relations&mdash;&s;ent to &s;chool&mdash;ne|glected by my grandfather&mdash;maltreated by my ma&s;ter&mdash;&s;ea&s;oned to adver&s;ity&mdash;I form cabals again&s;t the pedant&mdash;am debarred acce&s;s to my grandfather&mdash;hunted by his heir&mdash;I demoli&s;h the teeth of his tutor.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THERE were not wanting &s;ome, who &s;u&s;pected my uncles of being concerned in my father's fate, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they would all &s;hare in the patrimony de&s;tined for him; and this conjecture was &s;trengthened by reflecting, that in all his calamities they never di&s;covered the lea&s;t inclination to &s;erve him, but on the contrary, by all the artifices in their power, fed his father's re&s;entment, and &s;upported his re&s;olution of leaving him to mi&s;ery and want. But people of judgment treated this in&s;inuation as an idle chimera, becau&s;e, had my relations been &s;o wicked as to con&s;ult their intere&s;t by committing &s;uch an atrocious crime, the fate of my father would have extended to me too, who&s;e life was another ob&s;tacle to their expectation. Mean while I grew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pace, and as I &s;trongly re&s;embled my father, who was the darling of the tenants, I wanted no|thing which their indigent circum&s;tances could afford: but their favour was a weak re&s;ource again&s;t the jealous enmity of my cou&s;ins, who, the more my infancy promi&s;ed, con|ceived the more implacable hatred again&s;t me; and, before I was &s;ix years of age, had &s;o effectually blockaded my grandfather, that I never &s;aw him but by &s;tealth, when I &s;ometimes made up to his chair, as he &s;at to view his la|bourers in the field; on which occa&s;ions, he would &s;troke my head, bid me be a good boy, and promi&s;e to take care

of me. I was &s;oon after &s;ent to &s;chool at a village hard by, of which he had been dictator time out of mind: but, as he never paid for my board, nor &s;upplied me with clothes, books, and other nece&s;&s;aries I required, my condition was very ragged and contemptible; and the &s;choolma&s;ter, who, through fear of my grandfather, taught me <HI>gratis,</HI> gave him&s;elf no concern about the progre&s;s I made under his in&s;truction. In &s;pite of all the&s;e difficulties and di&s;graces, I became a good proficient in the Latin tongue; and, as &s;oon as I could write tolerably, pe&s;tered my grandfather with letters to &s;uch a degree, that he &s;ent for my ma&s;ter, and chid him &s;everely for be&s;towing &s;uch pains on my edu|cation, telling him, that if ever I &s;hould be brought to the gallows for forgery, which he had taught me to commit, my blood would lie on his head. The pedant, who dread|ed nothing more than the di&s;plea&s;ure of his patron, a&s;&s;ured his honour, that the boy's ability was more owing to his own genius and application, than to any in&s;truction or en|couragement he received; that although he could not di|ve&s;t him of the knowledge he had already imbibed, unle&s;s he would empower him to di&s;able his fingers, he &s;hould endeavour, with God's help, to prevent his future im|provement. And indeed he punctually performed what he had undertaken; for, on pretence that I had writ imper|tinent letters to my grandfather, he cau&s;ed a board to be made with five holes in it, through which he thru&s;t the fingers and thumb of my right-hand, and fa&s;tened it by a whip-cord to my wri&s;t, in &s;uch a manner as effectually de|barred me the u&s;e of my pen. But this re&s;traint I was freed from in a few days, by an accident which happened in a quarrel between me and another boy, who taking up|on him to in&s;ult my poverty, I was &s;o incen&s;ed at his un|generous reproach, that, with one &s;troke of my machine, I cut him to the &s;kull, to the great terror of my&s;elf and &s;chool-fellows, who left him bleeding on the ground, and ran to inform the ma&s;ter of what had happened. I was &s;o &s;everely puni&s;hed for this tre&s;pa&s;s, that, were I to live to the age of Methu&s;alem, the impre&s;&s;ion it made on me would not be effaced, no more than the antipathy and horror I conceived for the mercile&s;s tyrant who inflicted it. The contempt which my appearance naturally produced in all who &s;aw me, the continual wants to which I was ex|po&s;ed,
<PB N="7" REF="027715_0014_0FD5EB5A9A96EA50">
and my own haughty di&s;po&s;ition, impatient of af|fronts, involved me in a thou&s;and trouble&s;ome adven|tures, by which I was at length inured to adver&s;ity, and emboldened to undertakings far above my years. I was often inhumanly &s;courged for crimes I did not commit, be|cau&s;e, having the character of a vagabond in the village, every piece of mi&s;chief, who&s;e author lay unknown, was charged upon me. I have been found guilty of robbing orch|ards I never entered, of killing cats I never hurted, of &s;tealing gingerbread I never touched, and of abu&s;ing old women I never &s;aw. Nay, a &s;tammering carpenter had eloquence enough to per&s;uade my ma&s;ter, that I fired a pi&s;tol loaded with &s;mall &s;hot into his window, though my landlady and the whole family bore witne&s;s, that I was a-bed fa&s;t a&s;leep at the time when this outrage was committed. I was once flogged for having narrowly e&s;caped drowning, by the &s;inking of a ferry-boat in which I was pa&s;&s;enger; another time for having recovered of a brui&s;e occa&s;ioned by a hor&s;e and cart running over me; a third time for being bit by a baker's dog. In &s;hort, whether I was guilty or unfor|tunate, the correction and &s;ympathy of this arbitrary pe|dagogue were the &s;ame. Far from being &s;ubdued by this infernal u&s;age, my indignation triumphed over that &s;lavi&s;h awe, which had hitherto enforced my obedience, and the more my years and knowledge increa&s;ed, the more I per|ceived the inju&s;tice and barbarity of his behaviour. By the help of an uncommon genius, and the advice and direction of our u&s;her, who had &s;erved my father in his travels, I made a &s;urpri&s;ing progre&s;s in the cla&s;&s;ics, writing, and arithmetic; &s;o that, before I was twelve years old, I was allowed by every body to be the be&s;t &s;cholar in the &s;chool. This qualification, together with a boldne&s;s of temper, and &s;trength of make, which had &s;ubjected almo&s;t all my contemporaries, gave me &s;uch influence over them, that I began to form cabals again&s;t my per&s;ecutor, and was in hopes of being able to bid him defiance in a very &s;hort time. Being at the head of a faction con&s;i&s;ting of thirty boys, mo&s;t of them of my own age, I was determined to put their m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ttle to trial, that I might know how far they were to be depended upon, before I put my grand &s;cheme in execution: with this view we attacked a body of &s;tout apprentices, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a part
<PB N="8" REF="027715_0015_0FD5EB5FEE25ACC8">
of the ground allotted to us for the &s;cene of our diver&s;ions, and who were then playing at nine-pins on the &s;pot: but I had the mortification to &s;ee my adherents routed in an in&s;tant, and a leg of one of them broke in his flight by the bowl, which one of our adver&s;aries had detached in pur&s;uit of us. This di&s;comfiture did not hinder us from engaging them afterwards in frequent &s;kirmi&s;hes, which we maintained by throwing &s;tones at a di&s;tance, wherein I received many wounds, the &s;cars of which &s;till remain. Our enemies were &s;o harra&s;&s;ed and interrupted by the&s;e alarms, that they at la&s;t abandoned their conque&s;t, and left us to the peaceable enjoyment of our own territories. It would be endle&s;s to enumerate the exploits we perform|ed in the cour&s;e of this confederacy, which became the terror of the whole village; in&s;omuch, that when different intere&s;ts divided it, one of the parties commonly courted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Roderick Random (by which name I was known) to ca&s;t the balance, and keep the oppo&s;ite, faction in awe. Meanwhile, I took the advantage of every play day, to pre&s;ent my&s;elf before my grandfather, to whom I &s;eldom found acce&s;s, by rea&s;on of his being clo&s;e|ly be&s;ieged by a numerous family of his female grandchil|dren, who, though they perpetually quarrelled among them&s;elves, never failed to join again&s;t me, as the com|mon enemy of all. His heir, who was about the age of eighteen, minded nothing but &s;ox-hunting, and indeed was qualified for nothing el&s;e, notwith&s;tanding his grand|father's indulgence, in entertaining a tutor for him at home; who, at the &s;ame time, performed the office of pari&s;h clerk. This young Acteon, who inherited his grandfather's antipathy to every thing in di&s;tre&s;s, never &s;et eyes on me, without uncoupling his beagles, and hunting me into &s;ome cottage or other, whither I gene|rally fled for &s;helter. In this Chri&s;tian amu&s;ement he was encouraged by his preceptor, who, no doubt, took &s;uch opportunies to ingratiate him&s;elf with the ri&s;ing &s;un, ob|&s;erving that the old gentleman, according to the cour&s;e of nature, had not long to live, for he was already on the verge of four&s;core. The behaviour of this ra&s;cally &s;yco|phant incen&s;ed me &s;o much, that, one day, when I was beleagured by him and his hounds, in a farmer's hou&s;e, where I had found protection, I took aim at him (being

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOUT this time my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war, arrived in his own country; where, being informed of my condition, he came to &s;ee me, and out of his &s;lender fi|nances not only &s;upplied me with what nece&s;&s;aries I want|ed for the pre&s;ent, but re&s;olved not to leave the country un|til he had prevailed on my grandfather to &s;ettle &s;omething hand&s;ome on me for the future. This was a ta&s;k to which he was by no means equal, being entirely ignorant not only of the judge's di&s;po&s;ition, but al&s;o of the ways of men in general, to which his education on board had kept him an utter &s;tranger. He was a &s;trong built man, &s;ome|what bandy-legged, with a neck like that of a bull, and a face which (you might ea&s;ily perceive) had with&s;tood the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate a&s;&s;aults of the weather. His dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;oldier's coat altered by the &s;hip's taylor, a &s;triped flannel jacket, a pair of red breeches, japanned with pitch, clean grey wor&s;ted &s;tockings, large &s;ilver buckles that covered three fourths of his &s;hoes, a &s;ilver-laced hat who&s;e crown overlooked the brims about an inch and a half, a black bob wig in buckle, a check &s;hirt, a &s;ilk handkerchief, and a hanger with a bra&s;s handle, girded to his thigh by a tarni&s;hed laced belt, and a good oak plant under his arm. This equip'd, he &s;et out with me (who, by his bounty made a very decent appearance) for my grandfather's hou&s;e, where we were &s;aluted by Jowler and Cae&s;ar, whom my cou&s;in, young ma&s;ter, had let loo&s;e at our reproach. Being well acquainted with the inveteracy of the&s;e curs, I was about to betake my&s;elf to my heels, when my uncle &s;eized me with one hand,
<PB N="10" REF="027715_0017_0FD5EB6173634DD0">
brandi&s;hed his cudgel with the other, and at one blow laid Cae&s;ar &s;prawling on the ground: but, finding him&s;elf attacked at the &s;ame time in the rear by Jowler, and fearing Cae&s;ar might recover, he drew his hanger, wheel'd about, and by a lucky &s;troke, &s;evered Jowler's head from his body. By this time, the young fox-hunter and three &s;ervants, armed with pitch-forks, and flails, were come to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the dogs, whom they found breathle&s;s upon the field; and my cou&s;in was &s;o provoked at the death of his favourites, that he ordered his attendants to advance, and take vengeance on their executioner, whom he loaded with all the cur&s;es and reproaches his anger could &s;ugge&s;t. Upon which my uncle &s;tept forward, with an undaunted air, at the &s;ight of who&s;e bloody wea|pon his antagoni&s;ts fell back with precipitation, when he acco&s;ted their leader thus:&mdash;<Q>Lookee, brother, your dogs have boarded me without provocation; what I did was in my own defence. So you had be&s;t be civil, and let us &s;hoot a-head clear of you.</Q> Whether the young &s;quire mi&s;interpreted my uncle's de&s;ire of peace, or was enraged at the fate of his hounds beyond his u&s;ual pitch of re&s;olution, I know not; but, he &s;natched a flail from one of his followers, and came up with a &s;hew of a&s;&s;aulting the lieutenant, who putting him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence proceeded thus:&mdash;<Q>Lookee, you lubberly &s;on of a w&mdash;e, if you come athwart me, 'ware your gin|ger-bread-work. I'll be foul of your quarter, d&mdash;n me.</Q> This declaration, followed by a flouri&s;h of his hanger, &s;eem'd to check the progre&s;s of the young gen|tleman's choler, who, looking behind him, perceived his attendants had &s;lunk into the hou&s;e, &s;hut the gate, and left him to decide the contention by him&s;elf. Here a parley en&s;ued, which was introduced by my cou&s;in's a&s;k|ing, <Q>Who the d&mdash;l are you? What do you want? Some &s;coundrel of a &s;eaman (I &s;uppo&s;e) who has de|&s;erted and turned thief.

jacket for you.&mdash;I &s;hall rub you down with an oaken towel, my boy&mdash;I &s;hall.</Q> So &s;aying, he &s;heathed his hanger and gra&s;ped his cudgel. Meanwhile the people of the hou&s;e being alarm'd, one of my female cou&s;ins opened a window, and a&s;ked what was the matter?&mdash;<Q>The matter? (an&s;wered the lieutenant;) no great mat|ter, young woman.&mdash;I have bu&s;ine&s;s with the old gen|tleman; and this &s;park, belike, won't allow me to come along &s;ide of him, that's all.</Q>&mdash;After a few mi|nutes pau&s;e, we were admitted and conducted to my grand|father's chamber, through a lane of my relations, who honoured me with very &s;ignificant looks, as I pa&s;&s;ed along.

My grand|father (who was laid up with the gout) received this re|lation, after his long ab&s;ence, with that coldne&s;s of civi|lity which was peculiar to him; told him he was glad to &s;ee him, and de&s;ired him to &s;it down. <Q>Thank ye, thank ye, Sir, I had as lief &s;tand, (&s;aid my uncle:) for my own part I de&s;ire nothing of you; but if you have any con&s;cience at all, do &s;omething for this poor boy, who has been u&s;ed at a very unchri&s;tian rate.&mdash;Unchri&s;tian do I call it?&mdash;I am &s;ure the Moors in Barbary have more humanity than to leave their little ones to want.

He calmly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my uncle for his unmannerly behaviour, which he &s;aid he would excu&s;e on account of his education: he told him he had been very kind to the boy, whom he had kept at &s;chool &s;even or eight years, although he was informed he made no progre&s;s in his learning; but was addicted to all manner of vice, which he rather believed, becau&s;e he him&s;elf was a witne&s;s to a barbarous piece of mi&s;chief he had committed on the jaws of his chaplain. But, however, he would &s;ee what the lad was fit for, and bind him apprentice to &s;ome hone&s;t trade&s;man or other, pro|vided he would mend his manners, and behave for the future as became him. The hone&s;t tar (who&s;e pride and indignation boiled within him) an&s;wered my grand|father, that it was true he had &s;ent him to &s;chool, but it had co&s;t him nothing; for he had never been at one &s;hil|ling expence, to furni&s;h him with food, raiment, books, or other nece&s;&s;aries; &s;o it was not to be much won|dered at, if the boy made &s;mall progre&s;s; and yet, who|ever told him &s;o, was a lying lubberly ra&s;cal and de&s;erv|ed to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eel-haul'd: for tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he (the lieutenant) did not under&s;tand tho&s;e matters him&s;elf, he was well informed as how Rory was the be&s;t &s;cholar of his age, in all the coun|try&punc; the truth of which he would maintain, by laying a wager of his whole half year's pay on the boy's head; (with the&s;e words he pulled out his pur&s;e, and challenged the company.) <Q>Neither is he predicted to vice, as you affirm, but rather left like a wreck (d'ye &s;ee) at the mercy of the wind and weather, by your neglect, old

<P>A FEW weeks after our fir&s;t vi&s;it, we were informed that the old judge at the end of a fit of thought|fulne&s;s, which la&s;ted three days, had &s;ent for a notary and made his will; that the di&s;temper had mounted from his legs to his &s;tomach, and being con&s;cious of his ap|proaching end, he had de&s;ired to &s;ee all his de&s;cendants without exception.

During this inter|val, the conjectures of people, with regard to the old gentleman's will, were various: as it was well known he had, be&s;ides his landed e&s;tate, which was worth &s;even hundred pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and pounds at intere&s;t, &s;ome imagined that the whole real e&s;tate (which he had greatly improved) would go to the young man, whom he had always entertained as his heir; and that the money would be equally divided between my fe|male cou&s;ins (five in number) and me. Others were of opinion, that as the re&s;t of his children had been already provided for, he would only bequeath two or three hun|dred pounds to each of his grand-daughters, and leave the bulk of the &s;um to me, to atone for his unnatural u&s;age of my father. At length the important hour ar|rived, and the will was produced in the mid&s;t of the ex|pectants, who&s;e looks and ge&s;tures formed a groupe that would have been very entertaining to an unconcerned &s;pectator. But the reader <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;carce conceive the a&s;to|ni&s;hment and mortification <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> appeared, when an attor|ney pronounced aloud, the young &s;quire &s;ole heir of all his grandfather's e&s;tate per&s;onal and real. My uncle, who had li&s;tened with great attention, &s;ucking the head of his cudgel all the while, accompanied the&s;e words of the attorney with a &s;tare and whew, that alarmed that whole a&s;&s;embly. The elde&s;t and perte&s;t of my female competi|tors, who had been always very officious about my grand|father's per&s;on, inquired with a &s;aultering accent, and vi&s;age as yellow as an orange, <Q>if there were no lega|cies?</Q> and was an&s;wered, "none at all." Upon which &s;he fainted away. The re&s;t, whole expectations, perhaps,

were not &s;o &s;anguine, &s;upported their di&s;appointment with more re&s;olution, though not without giving evident marks of indignation and grief, at lea&s;t as genuine as that which appeared in them at the old gentleman's death. My conductor, after having kicked with his heel for &s;ome time again&s;t the wain&s;cot, began: <Q>So there's no lega|cy, friend, ha! here's an old &s;uccubus; but &s;omebo|dy's &s;oul howls for it, d&mdash;n me!</Q> The par&s;on of the pari&s;h, who was one of the executors, and had acted as gho&s;tly director to the old man, no &s;ooner heard this ex|clamation, than he cried out, <Q>Avaunt, unchri&s;tian re|viler! avaunt! wilt thou not allow the &s;oul of his ho|nour to re&s;t in peace?</Q> But this zealous pa&s;tor did not find him&s;elf &s;o warmly &s;econded, as formerly, by the young ladies, who now joined my uncle again&s;t him, and accu&s;ed him of having acted the part of a bu&s;y body with their grandpapa, who&s;e ears he had certainly abu&s;ed by fal&s;e &s;tories to their prejudice, or el&s;e he would not have neglected them in &s;uch an unnatural manner. The young &s;quire was much diverted with this &s;cene, and whi&s;pered to my uncle, that if he had not murdered his dogs, he would have &s;hewn him glorious &s;un, by hunting a black badger, (&s;o he termed the clergyman.) The &s;ur|ly lieutenant, who was not in an humour to reli&s;h this amu&s;ement, replied, <Q>You and your dogs may be d&mdash;n'd. I &s;uppo&s;e you'll find them with your old dad, in the latitude of hell. Come, Rory, about &s;hip, my lad, we mu&s;t &s;teer another cour&s;e, I think.</Q> And away we went.</P>

<P>ON our way back to the village, my uncle &s;poke not a word during the cour&s;e of a whole hour, but whi&s;tled with great vehemence, the tune of <HI>Why &s;hould we quarrel for riches,</HI> &amp;c. his vi&s;age being contracted all the while into a mo&s;t formidable frown. At length his pace increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that I was left behind a con|&s;iderable

way: then he waited for me; and when I was almo&s;t up with him, called out, in a &s;urly tone, <Q>Bear a hand, damme! mu&s;t I bring to every minute for you, you lazy dog.</Q> Then laying hold of me by the arm, hauled me along, until his good nature (of which he had a great &s;hare) and reflexion getting the better of his pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;aid, <Q>Come, my boy, don't be ca&s;t down&mdash;the old ra&s;cal is in hell&mdash;that's &s;ome &s;atisfac|tion; you &s;hall go to &s;ea with me, my lad. <HI>A light heart and a thin pair of breeches goes thorough the world, brave boys;</HI> as the &s;ong goes&mdash;eh?</Q> Though his pro|po&s;al did not at all &s;uit my inclination, I was afraid of di&s;covering my aver&s;ion to it, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t I &s;hould di&s;oblige the only friend I had in the world; and he was &s;o much a &s;eaman, that he never dreamt I could have any objection to his de&s;ign; con&s;equently gave him&s;elf no trouble in con&s;ulting my approbation. But this re&s;olution was &s;oon dropt by the advice of our u&s;her, who a&s;&s;ured Mr. Bowl|ing, it would be a thou&s;and pities to baulk my genius, which would certainly, one day, make my fortune on &s;hore, provided it received due cultivation. Upon which this generous tar determined (though he could ill afford it) to give me an univer&s;ity education; and accordingly &s;ettled my board and other expences, at a town not many miles di&s;tant, famous for its colleges, whither we repair|ed in a &s;hort time. But before the day of our departure, the &s;choolma&s;ter, who no longer had the fear of my grand|father before his eyes, laid a&s;ide all decency and re&s;traint, and not only abu&s;ed me in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t language his ran|cour could &s;ugge&s;t, as a wicked, profligate, dull, beg|garly mi&s;creant, whom he had taught out of charity; but al&s;o inveighed in the mo&s;t bitter manner again&s;t the me|mory of the judge, (who by the bye had procured that &s;et|tlement for him,) hinting, in pretty plain terms, that the old gentleman's &s;oul was damn'd to all eternity for his inju&s;tice in neglecting to pay for my learning. This bru|tal behaviour, added to the &s;ufferings I had formerly un|dergone, made me think it high time to be revenged of this in&s;olent pedagogue. Having con&s;ulted my adhe|rents, I found them all &s;taunch in their promi&s;es to &s;tand by me; and our &s;cheme was this: in the afternoon pre|ceding the day of my departure for the univer&s;ity, I re|&s;olved
<PB N="18" REF="027715_0025_0FD5EB7124AF6350">
to take the advantage of the u&s;her's going out to make water, (which he regularly did at four o'clock,) and &s;hut the great door, that he might not come to the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of his &s;uperior. This being done, the a&s;&s;ault was to be begun, by my advancing to my ma&s;ter and &s;pitting in his face. I was to be &s;econded by two of the &s;tronge&s;t boys in the &s;chool, who were devoted to me; their bu&s;i|ne&s;s was to join me in dragging the tyrant to a bench, over which he was to be laid, and his bare po&s;teriors heartily flogged with his own birch, which we propo&s;ed to wre&s;t from him in the &s;truggle; but if we &s;hould find him too many for us all three, we were to demand the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of our competitors, who &s;hould be ready to rein|force us, or oppo&s;e any thing that might be undertaken for the ma&s;ter's relief. One of my principal a&s;&s;i&s;tants was called Jeremy Gawky, &s;on and heir of a wealthy gentle|man in the neighbourhood; and the name of the other Hugh Strap, the cadet of a family which had given &s;hoe|makers to the village time out of mind. I had once &s;aved Gawky's life by plunging into a river and dragging him on &s;hore, when he was on the point of being drowned. I had often re&s;cued him from the clutches of tho&s;e whom his in&s;ufferable arrogance had provoked, to a re&s;entment he was not able to &s;u&s;tain; and many times &s;aved his re|putation and po&s;teriors, by performing his exerci&s;es at &s;chool; &s;o that it is not to be wondered at, if he had a particular regard for me and my intere&s;ts. The attach|ment of Strap flowed from a voluntary di&s;intere&s;ted incli|nation, which had manife&s;ted it&s;elf on many occa&s;ions in my behalf, he having once rendered me the &s;ame &s;ervice that I had done to Gawky, by &s;aving my life at the ri&s;k of his own; and often fathered offences that I had committed, for which he &s;uffered &s;everely, rather than I &s;hould feel the weight of the puni&s;hment I de&s;erved. The&s;e two cham|pions were the more willing to engage in this enterprize, becau&s;e they intended to leave the &s;chool the next day, as well as I; the fir&s;t being ordered by his father to return into the country, and the other being bound apprentice to a barber, at a market town not far off.</P>
<P>In the mean time my uncle, being informed of my ma&s;|ter's behaviour to me, was enraged at his in&s;olence, and vowed revenge &s;o heartily, that I could not refrain from
<PB N="19" REF="027715_0026_0FD5EB72C6422470">
telling him the &s;cheme I had concerted, which he heard with great &s;atisfaction, at every &s;entence &s;quirting out a mouthful of &s;pittle, tinctured with tobacco, of which he con&s;tantly chewed a large quid. At la&s;t, pulling up his breeches, he cried, <Q>No, no, Z&mdash;ds! that won't do nei|ther&mdash;how &s;omever, 'tis a bold undertaking, my lad&mdash;that I mu&s;t &s;ay, i'faith!&mdash;but lookee, lookee, how do&s;t propo&s;e to get clear off?&mdash;won't the enemy give chace, my boy?&mdash;ay, ay, that he will, I warrant&mdash;and alarm the whole coa&s;t&mdash;ah!

At length the hour arrived, when our auxiliary, &s;eizing the oppor|tunity of the u&s;her's ab&s;ence, bolted in, &s;ecured the door, and immediately laid hold of the pedant by his collar, who bawled out, "Murder! Thieves!"&mdash;with the voice of Stentor. Though I trembled all over like an a&s;pen leaf, I knew there was no time to be lo&s;t, and accordingly got up, and &s;ummoned our a&s;&s;ociates to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Strap without any he&s;itation obeyed the &s;ignal, and, &s;eeing me leap upon the ma&s;ter's back, ran immediately to one of his legs, which pulling with all his force, his dreadful adver|&s;ary was humbled to the ground: upon which Gawky, who had hitherto remained in his place under the influence of an univer&s;al trepidation, ha&s;tened to the &s;cene of action, and in&s;ulted the fallen tyrant with a loud huzza, in which the whole &s;chool joined. This noi&s;e alarmed the u&s;her, who, finding him&s;elf &s;hut out, endeavoured, partly by threats, and partly by entreaties, to procure admi&s;&s;ion. My uncle bade him have a little patience, and he would let him in pre&s;ently; but, if he pretended to move from

that place, it &s;hould fare wor&s;e with the &s;on of a b&mdash;ch his &s;uperior, on whom he intended only to be&s;tow a little whole&s;ome cha&s;ti&s;ement for his barbarous u&s;age to Rory, "to which," &s;aid he, "you are no &s;tranger." By this time we had dragged the criminal to a po&s;t, to which Bowling tied him with a rope he had provided on pur|po&s;e, after having &s;ecured his hands, and &s;tripped his back. In this ludicrous po&s;ture he &s;tood, (to the no &s;mall enter|tainment of the boys, who crowded about him, and &s;hout|ed with great exultation at the novelty of the &s;ight,) vent|ing bitter imprecations again&s;t the lieutenant, and re|proaching his &s;cholars with treachery and rebellion; when the u&s;her was admitted, whom my uncle acco&s;ted in this manner: <Q>Harkee, Mr. Syntax, I believe you are an hone&s;t man, d'ye &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;and I have a re&s;pect for you&mdash;but, for all that, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for our own &s;ecurity (d'ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ee) belay you for a &s;hort time.</Q> With the&s;e words, he pulled out &s;ome fathoms of cord, which the hone&s;t man no &s;ooner &s;aw than he prote&s;ted with great earne&s;tne&s;s, he would allow no violence to be offered to him, at the &s;ame time accu&s;ing me of perfidy and ingratitude. But Bowling repre&s;enting, that it was in vain to re&s;i&s;t, and that he did not mean to u&s;e him with violence and indecency, but only to hinder him from rai&s;ing the hue and cry again&s;t us, be|fore we &s;hould be out of their power, he allowed him&s;elf to be bound to his own de&s;k, where he &s;at a &s;pectator of the puni&s;hment inflicted on his principal. My uncle, having upbraided this arbitrary wretch with his inhuma|nity to me, told him, that he propo&s;ed to give him a little di&s;cipline for the good of his &s;oul, which he immediately put in practice with great vigour and dexterity. This &s;mart application to the pedant's withered po&s;teriors gave him &s;uch exqui&s;ite pain, that he roared like a mad bull, danced, cur&s;ed, and bla&s;phemed like a frantic bedlamite. When the lieutenant thought him&s;elf &s;ufficiently revenged, he took his leave of him in the&s;e words: <Q>Now, friend, you'll remember me the longe&s;t day you have to live&mdash;I have given you a le&s;&s;on that will let you know what flogging is, and teach you to have more &s;ympathy for the future&mdash;Shout, boys, &s;hout.</Q> This ceremony was no &s;ooner over tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> my uncle propo&s;ed they &s;hould quit the &s;chool, and convoy their old comrade Rory to a pub|lic

hou&s;e, about a mile from the village, where he would treat them all. His offer being joyfully embraced, he ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Mr. Syntax, and begged him to accom|pany us; but this invitation he refu&s;ed with great di&s;dain, telling my benefactor he was not the man he took him to be. "Well, well, old Surly," replied my uncle, &s;haking his hand, <Q>thou art an hone&s;t fellow notwith&s;tanding; and, if ever I have the command of a &s;hip, thou &s;halt be our &s;choolma&s;ter, i'faith.</Q> So &s;aying, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the boys, and, locking the door, left the two preceptors to con&s;ole one another, while we moved forwards on our journey, attended by a numerous retinue, whom he treat|ed according to his promi&s;e. We parted with many tears, and lay that night at an inn on the road about ten miles &s;hort of the town where I was to remain, at which we arrived next day, and I found I had no cau&s;e to complain of the accommodations provided for me, in being boarded at the hou&s;e of an apothecary, who had married a di&s;tant relation of my mother.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS I was now capable of reflection, I began to con&s;i|der my precarious &s;ituation; that I was utterly abandoned by tho&s;e who&s;e duty it was to protect me, and that my &s;ole dependance was on the genero&s;ity of one man, who was not only expo&s;ed by his profe&s;&s;ion to continual dangers which might one day deprive me of him for ever, but al&s;o (no doubt &s;ubject to tho&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes of di&s;po|&s;ition which a change of fortune u&s;ually creates, or which a better acquaintance with the world might produce; for I always a&s;cribed his benevolence to the dictates of a heart as yet undebauched by a commerce with mankind. Alarm|ed at the&s;e con&s;iderations, I re&s;olved to apply my&s;elf with
<PB N="22" REF="027715_0029_0FD5EB7ACC56A930">
great care to my &s;tudies, and enjoy the opportunity now in my power: this I did with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that in the &s;pace of three years I under&s;tood Greek very well, was pretty far advanced in the mathematics, and no &s;tranger to moral and natural philo&s;ophy: logic I made no account of; but, above all things, I valued my&s;elf on my ta&s;te in the <HI>belle lettres,</HI> and a talent for poetry, which had already produced &s;ome pieces that met with a very favourable re|ception. The&s;e qualifications, added to a good face and &s;hape, acquired the e&s;teem and acquaintance of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable people in town, and I had the &s;atisfaction to find my&s;elf in &s;ome degree of favour with the ladies; an intoxicating piece of good fortune to one of my amorous complexion! which I obtained, or at lea&s;t pre&s;erved, by gratifying their propen&s;ity to &s;candal, in lampooning their rivals. Two of my female cou&s;ins lived in this place, with their mother, &s;ince the death of their father, who left his whole fortune equally divided between them; &s;o that, if they were not the mo&s;t beautiful, they were at lea&s;t the riche&s;t toa&s;ts in town, and received daily the addre&s;&s;es of all the beaux and cavaliers of the country. Although I had hitherto been looked upon by them with the mo&s;t &s;u|percilious contempt, my character now attracted their no|tice &s;o much, that I was given to under&s;tand I might be honoured with their acquaintance, if I plea&s;ed. The reader will ea&s;ily perceive, that this conde&s;cen&s;ion either flowed from the hope of making my poetical capacity &s;ub|&s;ervient to their malice, or at lea&s;t of &s;creening them&s;elves from the la&s;h of my re&s;entment, which they had effectually provoked. I enjoyed this triumph with great &s;atisfaction, and not only rejected their offer with di&s;dain, but in all my performances, whether &s;atire or panegyric, indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly avoided mentioning their names, even while I cele|brated tho&s;e of their intimates. This neglect mortified their pride exceedingly, and incen&s;ed them to &s;uch a degree, that they were re&s;olved to make me repent of my indiffer|ence. The fir&s;t &s;troke of their revenge con&s;i&s;ted in their hiring a poor collegian to write ver&s;es again&s;t me, the &s;ub|ject of which was my own poverty, and the cata&s;trophe of my unhappy parents. But be&s;ides the badne&s;s of the com|po&s;ition, (of which they them&s;elves were a&s;hamed,) they did not find their account in endeavouring to reproach me
<PB N="23" REF="027715_0030_0FD5EB7BB52FC4B8">
with tho&s;e misfortunes which they and their relations had brought upon me, and which con&s;equently reflected much more di&s;honour on them&s;elves than on me, who was the innocent victim of their barbarity and avarice. Finding this plan mi&s;carry, they found means to irritate a young gentleman again&s;t me, by telling him I had lampooned his mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;o effectually &s;ucceeded in the quality of in|cendiaries, that this enraged lover determined to &s;eize me next night as I returned to my lodgings from a friend's hou&s;e that I frequented; with this view he waited in the &s;treet, attended by two of his companions, to whom he had imparted his de&s;ign of carrying me down to the river, in which he propo&s;ed to have me heartily ducked, not|with&s;tanding the &s;everity of the weather, it being then about the middle of December. But this &s;tratagem did not &s;ucceed; for, being apprized of their ambu&s;h, I got home another way, and, by the help of my landlord's apprentice, di&s;charged a volley from the garret-window, which did great execution upon them, and next day oc|ca&s;ioned &s;o much mirth at their expence, that they &s;ound them&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of leaving the town, until the adventure &s;hould be entirely forgotten. My cou&s;ins (tho' twice baffled in their expectations) did not, however, de&s;i&s;t from per&s;ecuting me, who had now enraged them beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of forgivene&s;s, by detecting their malice, and preventing its effects: neither &s;hould I have found them more humane, had I patiently &s;ubmitted to their rancour, and bore without murmuring the rigour of their unrea&s;on|able hate; for I have found by experience, that, though &s;mall favours may be acknowledged, and &s;light injuries aton|ed for, there is no wretch &s;o ungrateful as he whom you have mo&s;t generou&s;ly obliged, and no enemy &s;o implacable as tho&s;e who have done you the greate&s;t wrong. The&s;e good-natured creatures, therefore, had recour&s;e to a &s;cheme which con&s;pired with a piece of bad news I &s;oon after received, to give them all the &s;atisfaction they de&s;ir|ed: this plan was to debauch the faith of my companion and confident, who betrayed the tru&s;t I repo&s;ed in him, by imparting to them the particulars of my &s;mall amours, which they publi&s;hed with &s;uch exaggerations, that I &s;uf|fered very much in the opinion of every body, and was utterly di&s;carded by the dear creatures who&s;e names had
<PB N="24" REF="027715_0031_0FD5EB7D33956608">
been called in que&s;tion. While I was bu&s;y in tracing out the author of this treachery, that I might not only be re|venged on him, but al&s;o vindicate my character to my friends, I one day perceived the looks of my landlady much altered, when I went home to dinner, and, inquiring into the cau&s;e, &s;he &s;crewed up her mouth, and, fixing her eyes on the ground, told me her hu&s;band had received a letter from Mr. Bowling, with one inclo&s;ed for me&mdash;She was very &s;orry for what had happened, both for my &s;ake and his own&mdash;People &s;hould be more cautious of their con|duct&mdash;She was always afraid his brutal behaviour would bring him into &s;ome misfortune or other.

I was li&s;tening to this my&s;terious di&s;|cour&s;e with great amazement, when her hu&s;band entered, and, without &s;peaking a &s;yllable, put both the letters into my hand. I received them trembling, and read what follows:</P>

<P>THIS is to let you know that I have quitted the Thunder man of war, being obliged to &s;heer off for killing my captain, which I did fairly on the beach at Cape Tiberoon in the i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola, having re|ceived his fire, and returned it, which went through his body: and I would &s;erve the be&s;t man &s;o that ever &s;tept between &s;tem and &s;tern, if &s;o be that he &s;truck me, as Captain Oakham did. I am (thank God) &s;afe among the French, who are very civil, tho' I don't under&s;tand their lingo&mdash;and I hope to be re&s;tored in a little time, for all the great friends and parliamentary intere&s;t of the captain; for I have &s;ent over to my landlord in Deal an account of the whole affair, with our bearings and di&s;tances while we were engaged, whereby I have de|&s;ired

<P>This letter (which with the other was dated from Port Louis in Hi&s;paniola) I had no &s;ooner read, than the apo|thecary, &s;haking his head, began:&mdash;<Q>I have a very great regard for Mr. Bowling, that's certain&mdash;and could be well content&mdash;but times are very hard.&mdash;There's no &s;uch thing as money to be got&mdash;I believe 'tis all vani&s;hed under ground, for my part.&mdash;Be&s;ides, I have been out of pocket already, having entertained you &s;ince the be|ginning of this mouth, without receiving a &s;ixpence&mdash;and God knows if ever I &s;hall; for I believe it will go hard with your uncle&mdash;And more than that, I was thinking to give you warning; for I want your apart|ment for a new 'prentice, whom I expect from the coun|try every hour&mdash;So, I de&s;ire you will this week pro|vide your&s;elf with another lodging.</Q> The indignation which this harangue in&s;pired, gave me &s;pirits to &s;upport my rever&s;e of fortune, and to tell him, I de&s;pi&s;ed his mean, &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition &s;o much, that I would rather &s;tarve than be beholden to him for one &s;ingle meal.

of rage and &s;orrow, without knowing whither to fly for &s;helter, having not one friend in the world capable of relieving me, and only three &s;hillings in my pur&s;e. After giving way for a few minutes to the dictates of my rage, I went and hired a &s;mall bed-room at the rate of one &s;hil|ling and &s;ixpence <HI>per</HI> week, which I was obliged to pay <HI>per</HI> advance, before the landlord would receive me: thither I removed my luggage; and next morning got up, with a view of craving the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a per&s;on who had on all occa&s;ions loaded me with care&s;&s;es, and made fre|quent offers of friend&s;hip while I was under no nece&s;&s;ity of accepting them. He received me with his wonted af|fability, and in&s;i&s;ted on my breakfa&s;ting with him, a fa|vour which I did not think &s;it to refu&s;e. But, when I communicated the occa&s;ion of my vi&s;it, he appeared &s;o di&s;concerted, that I concluded him wonderfully affected with the mi&s;ery of my condition, and I looked upon him as a man of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;ympathy and benevolence. He did not leave me long under this mi&s;take; for, reco|vering him&s;elf from his confu&s;ion, he told me he was griev|ed at my misfortune, and de&s;ired to know what had pa&s;&s;|ed between my landlord Mr. Potion and me: whereupon I recounted the conver&s;ation; and, when I repeated the an&s;wer I made to his ungenerous remon&s;trance with regard to my leaving his hou&s;e, this pretended friend affected a &s;tare, and exclaimed, <Q>Is it po&s;&s;ible you could behave &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill to the man who had treated you &s;o kindly all along?</Q> My &s;urprize at hearing this was not at all affected, what|ever his might be; and I gave him to under&s;tand with &s;ome warmth, that I did not imagine he would &s;o unrea|&s;onably e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of a &s;coundrel, who ought to be expelled from every &s;ocial community. This heat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f mine gave him all the advantage he de&s;ired over me, and our di&s;cour&s;e (after much altercation) concluded in his de&s;iring never to &s;ee me again in that place; to which de&s;ire I yielded my con&s;ent, a&s;&s;uring him, that, had I been as well acquainted with his principles formerly as I was now, he never &s;hould have had an opportunity of making that reque&s;t.&mdash;And thus we parted.</P>
<P>On my return I met my comrade Squire Gawky, whom his father had &s;ent &s;ome time ago to town for his improve|ment in writing, dancing, fencing, and other modi&s;h qua|lifications.

As I had lived with him, &s;ince his arrival, on the footing of our old intimacy, I made no &s;cruple of in|forming him of the lowne&s;s of my circum&s;tances, and a&s;k|ing a &s;mall &s;upply of money to an&s;wer my pre&s;ent expence; upon which he pulled out a handful of halfpence, with a &s;hilling or two among them, and &s;wore that was all he had to keep his pocket till next quarter-day, he having lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of his allowance the night before at billiards. Though his a&s;&s;ertion might very well be true, I was extremely mortified at his indifference; for he nei|ther expre&s;&s;ed any &s;ympathy for my mi&s;hap, nor de&s;ire of alleviating my di&s;tre&s;s; and accordingly I left him with|out uttering one word: but when I afterwards under&s;tood, that he was the per&s;on who had formerly betrayed me to the malice of my cou&s;ins, to whom likewi&s;e he had carried the tidings of my forlorn &s;ituation, which afforded them great matter of triumph and exultation, I determined with my&s;elf to call him to a &s;evere account; for which purpo&s;e I borrowed a &s;word, and wrote a challenge, de|&s;iring him to meet me at a certain time and place, that I might have an opportunity of puni&s;hing his perfidy at the expence of his blood. He accepted the invitation, and I betook my&s;elf to the field, though not without feeling con&s;iderable repugnance to the combat, which frequently attacked me in cold &s;weats by the way; but the de&s;ire of revenge, the &s;hame of retracting, and hope of conque&s;t, con&s;pired to repel the&s;e unmanly &s;ymptoms of fear, and I appeared on the plain with a good grace: there I waited an hour beyond the time appointed, and was not ill plea|&s;ed to find he had no mind to meet me, becau&s;e I &s;hould have an opportunity of expo&s;ing his cowardice, di&s;playing my own courage, and of beating him &s;oundly where&s;oever I &s;hould find him, without any dread of the con&s;equence. Elevated with the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, which entirely bani&s;hed all thoughts of my deplorable condition, I went directly to Gawky's lodgings, where I was informed of his preci|pitate retreat, he having &s;et out for the country in le&s;s than an hour after he had received my billet: and I was vain enough to have the whole &s;tory in&s;erted in the news, although I was fain to &s;ell a gold-laced hat to my landlord, for le&s;s than half-price, to defray the expence, and con|tribute to my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>I am entertained by Mr. Crab&mdash;a de&s;cription of him&mdash;I ac|quire the art of &s;urgery&mdash;con&s;ult Crab's di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;be|come nece&s;&s;ary to him&mdash;an accident happens&mdash;he advi&s;es me to launch into the world&mdash;a&s;&s;i&s;ts me with money&mdash;I &s;et out for London.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE fumes of my re&s;entment being di&s;&s;ipated as well as the vanity of my &s;ucce&s;s, I found my&s;elf de&s;erted to all the horrors of extreme want, and avoided by man|kind as a creature of a different &s;pecies, or rather as a &s;o|litary being, no ways comprehended within the &s;cheme or protection of Providence. My de&s;pair had rendered me almo&s;t quite &s;tupified, when I was one day told, that a gentleman de&s;ired to &s;ee me at a certain public-hou&s;e, whi|ther I immediately repaired, and was introduced to one Mr. Lancelot Crab, a &s;urgeon in town, who was engaged with two more in drinking a liquor called <HI>pop-in,</HI> compo|&s;ed by mixing a quartern of brandy with a quart of &s;mall|beer. Before I relate the occa&s;ion of this me&s;&s;age, I be|lieve it will not be di&s;agreeable to the reader, if I de&s;cribe the gentleman who &s;ent for me, and mention &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances of his character and conduct, which may illu&s;|trate what follows, and account for his behaviour to me.</P>
<P>This member of the faculty was aged fifty, about five feet high, and ten round the belly; his face was capacious as a full moon, and much of the complexion of a mulber|ry; his no&s;e, re&s;embling a powder-horn, was &s;welled to an enormous &s;ize, and &s;tudded all over with carbuncles; and his little grey eyes reflected the rays in &s;uch an oblique manner, that, while he looked a per&s;on full in the face, one would have imagined he was admiring the buckle of his &s;hoe. He had long entertained an implacable re&s;ent|ment again&s;t Potion, who, though a young practitioner, was better employed than he, and once had the a&s;&s;urance to perform a cure, whereby he di&s;appointed and di&s;graced the progno&s;tic of the &s;aid Crab. This quarrel, which was at one time upon the point of being made up by the inter|po&s;ition and mediation of friends, had been lately inflamed beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of reconciliation by the re&s;pective wives of the opponents, who, chancing to meet at a
<PB N="29" REF="027715_0036_0FD5EB8CE255A858">
chri&s;tening, di&s;agreed about precedence, proceeded from invectives to blows, and were with great difficulty, by the go&s;&s;ips, prevented from converting the occa&s;ion of joy into a &s;cene of lamentation.</P>
<P>The difference between the&s;e rivals was in the height of rancour, when I received the me&s;&s;age of Crab, who receiv|ed me as civilly as I could have expected from one of his di&s;po&s;ition, and, after de&s;iring me to &s;it, inquired into the particulars of my leaving the hou&s;e of Potion; which when I had related, he &s;aid with a malicious grin&mdash;<Q>There's a &s;neaking dog!&mdash;I always thought him a fellow with|out a &s;oul, d&mdash;n me!&mdash;a canting &s;coundrel, who has crept into bu&s;ine&s;s by his hypocri&s;y, and ki&s;&s;ing the a&mdash;&s;e of every body.</Q>&mdash;"Ay, ay," &s;ays another, <Q>one might &s;ee with half an eye, that the ra&s;cal has no ho|ne&s;ty, in him by his going &s;o regularly to church.</Q> This &s;entence was confirmed by a third, who a&s;&s;ured his com|panions, that Potion was never known to be di&s;gui&s;ed in liquor but once at the meeting of the godly, where he had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by an extempore prayer an hour long. After this preamble Crab addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me in the&s;e words: <Q>Well, my lad, I have heard a good character of you, and I'll do for you.&mdash;You may &s;end your things to my hou&s;e when you plea&s;e&mdash;I have given orders for your reception.&mdash;Z&mdash;ds! what does the booby &s;tare at? If you have no mind to embrace my courteous offer, you may let it alone, and be d&mdash;n'd.</Q> I an&s;wered with a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive bow, that I was far from rejecting his friend|ly offer, which I would immediately accept, as &s;oon as he &s;hould inform me on what footing I was to be entertained. "What footing! d&mdash;n my blood," cried he, <Q>d'ye ex|pect to have a footman and a couple of hor&s;es kept for you?</Q> "No, Sir," I replied, <Q>my expectations are not quite &s;o &s;anguine. That I may be as little burden|&s;ome as po&s;&s;ible, I would willingly &s;erve in your &s;hop, by which means I may &s;ave you the expence of a jour|neyman, or porter at lea&s;t; for I under&s;tand a little pharmacy, having employed &s;ome of my lei&s;ure hours in the practice of that art, while I lived with Mr. Po|tion; neither am I altogether ignorant of &s;urgery, which I have &s;tudied with great plea&s;ure and application.</Q> "O ho! you did?" &s;ays Crab. <Q>Gentleman, here is
<PB N="30" REF="027715_0037_0FD5EB8E5C01EFE8">
a complete arti&s;t!&mdash;Studied &s;urgery! what? in books, I &s;uppo&s;e.&mdash;I &s;hall have you di&s;puting with me one of the&s;e days on points of my profe&s;&s;ion.&mdash;You can alrea|dy account for mu&s;cular motion, (I warrant,) and ex|plain the my&s;tery of the brain and nerves&mdash;ha!&mdash;You are too learned for me, d&mdash;n me. But let's hear no more to this &s;tuff&mdash;Can you bleed, and give a cly&s;ter, &s;pread a plai&s;ter, and prepare a potion?</Q>&mdash;Upon my an&s;wering in the affirmative, he &s;hook his head, telling me, he believed he &s;hould have little good of me for all my promi&s;es; but, however, he would take me in for the &s;ake of charity. I was accordingly that very night admitted to his hou&s;e, and had an apartment a&s;&s;igned to me in the garret, which I was fain to put up with, notwith&s;tanding the mortification my pride &s;uffered in this change of cir|cum&s;tances. I was &s;oon convinced of the real motives which induced Crab to receive me in this manner; for, be&s;ides the gratification of his revenge, by expo&s;ing the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of his antagoni&s;t in oppo&s;ition to his own gene|ro&s;ity, which was all affectation, he had occa&s;ion for a young man, who under&s;tood &s;omething of the profe&s;&s;ion, to fill up the place of his elde&s;t apprentice, lately dead, not without violent &s;u&s;picion of foul play from his ma&s;ter's bru|tality. The knowledge of this circum&s;tance, together with his daily behaviour to his wife and the young apprentice, did not at all contribute to my enjoying my new &s;ituation with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e; however, as I did not perceive how I could be&s;tow my&s;elf to better advantage, I re&s;olved to &s;tudy Crab's temper with all the application, and manage it with all the addre&s;s in my power. And it was not long before I &s;ound out a &s;trange peculiarity of humour, which go|verned his behaviour towards all his dependants;&mdash;I ob&s;er|ved, when he was plea&s;ed, he was &s;uch a niggard of his &s;atisfaction, that, if his wife or &s;ervants betrayed the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of participation, he was offended to an in&s;up|portable degree of choler and fury, the effects of which they &s;eldom failed to feel; and, when his indignation was rou&s;ed, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and &s;oothing always exa&s;perated it be|yond the bounds of rea&s;on and humanity. I therefore pur|&s;ued a contrary plan; and one day, when he honoured me with the names of ignorant whelp, and lazy ragamuffin, I boldly replied, I was neither ignorant nor lazy, &s;ince I

both under&s;tood and performed my bu&s;ine&s;s as well as he could do for his &s;oul; neither was it ju&s;t to call me a ra|gamuffin; for I had a whole coat on any back, and was de&s;cended from a better family than any he could boa&s;t an alliance with. He gave tokens of great amazement at this a&s;&s;urance of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ne, and &s;hook his cane over my head, ragarding me all the time with a countenance truly dia|bolical. Although I was terribly &s;tartled at his menacing looks and po&s;ture&punc; I yet had reflexion enough left to convince me I had gone too far to retract, and that this was the critical minute, which mu&s;t decide my future lot in his &s;ervice; I therefore &s;natched up the pe&s;tle of a mortar, and &s;wore, if he offered to &s;trike me without a cau&s;e, I &s;hould &s;ee whether his &s;kull or my weapon was harde&s;t.&mdash;He continued &s;ilent for &s;ome time, and at la&s;t broke forth into the&s;e ejaculations: <Q>This is fine u&s;age from a &s;ervant to a ma&s;ter,&mdash;very fine!&mdash;damnation!&mdash;but, no matter, you &s;hall pay for this, you dog, you &s;hall&mdash;I'll do your bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;yes, yes, I'll teach you to lift your hand again&s;t me</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying, he re|tired and left me under dreadful apprehen&s;ions, which va|ni&s;hed entirely at our next meeting, when he behaved with unu&s;ual complacency, and treated me with a gla&s;s of punch after dinner.&mdash;By this conduct I got the a&s;cen|dancy over him in a &s;hort time, and became &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to him, in managing his bu&s;ine&s;s while he was engaged at the bottle, that fortune began to wear a kinder a&s;pect; and I con&s;oled my&s;elf for the di&s;regard of my former ac|quaintance, with the knowledge I daily imbibed, by a clo&s;e application to the duties of my employment, in which I &s;ucceeded beyond my own expectation. I was on very good terms with my ma&s;ter's wife, who&s;e e&s;teem I acquired and cultivated, by repre&s;enting Mrs. Potion in the mo&s;t ridiculous light my &s;atirical talents could in|vent, as well as by rendering her &s;ome chri&s;tian offices, when &s;he had been too familiar with the dram bottle, to which &s;he had oftentimes recour&s;e for con&s;olation, under the affliction &s;he &s;uffered from a barbarous hu&s;band. In this manner I lived, without hearing the lea&s;t tidings of my uncle, for the &s;pace of two years, during which time I kept little or no company, being neither in a humour to reli&s;h, nor in a capacity to maintain, much acquain|tance;
<PB N="32" REF="027715_0039_0FD5EB97D177AA18">
for the Nabal my ma&s;ter allowed me no wages; and the &s;mall perqui&s;ites of my &s;tation &s;carce &s;upplied me with the common nece&s;&s;aries of life&mdash;I was no longer a pert, unthinking coxcomb, giddy with popular applau&s;e, and elevated with the extravagance of hope; my misfor|tunes had taught me how little the care&s;&s;es of the world, during a man's pro&s;perity, are to be valued by him; and how &s;eriou&s;ly and expeditiou&s;ly he ought to &s;et about ma|king him&s;elf independent of them. My pre&s;ent appear|ance, therefore, was the lea&s;t of my care, which was wholly engro&s;&s;ed in laying up a &s;tock of in&s;truction that might &s;ecure me again&s;t the caprice of fortune for the future. I became &s;uch a &s;loven, and contracted &s;uch an air of au&s;terity, that every body pronounced me cre&s;t|fallen; and Gawky returned to town without running any ri&s;que from my re&s;entment, which was by this time pret|ty much cooled, and re&s;trained by prudential rea&s;ons, &s;o effectually, that I never &s;o much as thought of obtaining &s;atisfaction for the injuries he had done me. When I deemed my&s;elf &s;ufficiently ma&s;ter of my bu&s;ine&s;s, I began to ca&s;t about for an opportunity of launching into the world, in hope of finding &s;ome provi&s;ion, that might make amends for the difficulties I had undergone: but, as this could not be effected without a &s;mall &s;um of mo|ney to equip me for the field, I was in the utmo&s;t per|plexity how to rai&s;e it, well knowing, that Crab, for his own &s;ake, would never put me in a condition to leave him, when his intere&s;t was &s;o much concerned in my &s;tay. But a &s;mall accident, which happened about this time, determined him in my favour. This was no other than the pregnancy of his maid-&s;ervant, who declared her &s;itu|ation to me, a&s;&s;uring me at the &s;ame time, that I was the occa&s;ion of it. Although I had no rea&s;on to que&s;tion the truth of this imputation, I was not ignorant of the familiarities which had pa&s;&s;ed between her ma&s;ter and her, taking the advantage of which, I repre&s;ented to her the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly of laying the burden at my door, when &s;he might di&s;po&s;e of it to much better purpo&s;e with Mr. Crab: &s;he li&s;tened to my advice, and next day acquainted him with the pretended &s;ucce&s;s of their mutual endeavours. He was far from being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">verjoyed at this proof of his vigour, which he fore&s;aw might have very trouble&s;ome con&s;equen|ces;
<PB N="33" REF="027715_0040_0FD5EB990E46E458">
not that he dreaded any dome&s;tic grumblings and reproaches from his wife, whom he kept in perfect &s;ub|jection; but becau&s;e he knew it would furni&s;h his rival Potion with a handle for in&s;ulting and undermining his reputation, there being no &s;candal equal to that of un|cleanne&s;s, in the opinion of tho&s;e who inhabit the part of the i&s;land where he lived. He therefore took a re&s;olution worthy of him&s;elf, which was to per&s;uade the girl, that &s;he was not with child, but only afflicted with a di&s;order incident to young women, which he could ea&s;ily remove: with this view (as he pretended) he pre&s;cribed for her &s;uch medicines as he thought would infallibly procure abortion: but in this &s;cheme he was di&s;appointed; for the maid being adverti&s;ed by me of his de&s;ign, and at the &s;ame time well acquainted with her own condition, ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed to follow his directions; and threatened to publi&s;h her &s;ituation to the world, if he would not imme|diately take &s;ome method of providing for the important occa&s;ion, which &s;he expected in a few months. It was not long before I gue&s;&s;ed the re&s;ult of his deliberation, by his addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me (one day) in this manner: <Q>I am &s;urpri&s;ed, that a young fellow like you, di&s;covers no inclination to pu&s;h his fortune in the world. Before I was of your age, I was broiling on the coa&s;t of Gui|nea.&mdash;Damme! what's to hinder you from profiting by the war, which will certainly be declared in a &s;hort time again&s;t Spain?&mdash;You may ea&s;ily go on board a king's &s;hip in quality of &s;urgeon's mate, where you will certainly &s;ee a great deal of practice, and &s;tand a good chance of getting prize-money.</Q>&mdash;I laid hold of this declaration, which I had long wi&s;hed for, and a&s;&s;ur|ed him I would follow his advice with plea&s;ure, if it was in my power; but that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to em|brace an opportunity of that kind, as I had no friend to advance a little money, to &s;upply me with what nece&s;&s;a|ries I &s;hould want, and defray the expences of my jour|ney to London. He told me, that few nece&s;&s;aries were required; and as for the expence of my journey, he would lend me money, &s;ufficient not only for that purpo&s;e, but al&s;o to maintain me comfortably in London, until I &s;hould procure a warrant for my provi&s;ion on board of &s;ome &s;hip.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THERE is no &s;uch convenience as a waggon in this country, and my finances were too weak to &s;upport the expence of hiring a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> determined therefore to &s;et out with the carriers, who tran&s;port goods from one place to another on hor&s;eback; and this &s;cheme I accord|ingly put in execution, on the fir&s;t day of November 1732, &s;itting upon a pack-&s;addle between two ba&s;kets; one of which contained my goods in a knap&s;ack. But by the time we arrived at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, I was &s;o fatigued with the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the carriage, and benumbed with the coldne&s;s of the weather, that I re&s;olved to travel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;t of my journey on foot, rather than proceed in &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;agreeable manner.</P>
<P>The ho&s;tler of the inn at which we put up, under&s;tand|ing I was bound for London, advi&s;ed me to take my pa&s;|&s;age in a collier, which would be both cheap and expedi|tious, and withal much ea&s;ier than to walk upwards of three hundred miles through deep roads, in the winter time; a journey which he believed I had not &s;trength enough to perform. I was almo&s;t per&s;uaded to take his advice, when, one day, &s;tepping into a barber's &s;hop to be &s;haved, the young man, while he lathered my face,
<PB N="35" REF="027715_0042_0FD5EB9BE09B1B60">
acco&s;ted me thus: <Q>Sir, I pre&s;ume you are a Scotch|man.</Q> I an&s;wered in the affirmative.&mdash;<Q>Pray (con|tinued he) from what part of Scotland?</Q> I no &s;oon|er told him, than he di&s;covered great emotion, and not confining his operation to my chin and upper-lip, be|&s;meared my whole face with great agitation. I was &s;o offended at this profu&s;ion, that &s;tarting up, I a&s;ked him what the d&mdash;l he meant by u&s;ing me &s;o? He begged par|don, telling me his joy at meeting with a countryman had occa&s;ioned &s;ome confu&s;ion in him: and craved my name.&mdash;But when I declared my name was Random, he ex|claimed in a rapture, "How! Rory Random?" The &s;ame, replied I, looking at him with a&s;toni&s;hment. <Q>What cried he, don't you know your old &s;chool-fellow, Hugh Strap?</Q> At that in&s;tant recollecting his face, I flew into his arms, and in the tran&s;port of my joy, gave him back one half of the &s;uds he had &s;o lavi&s;hly be&s;towed on my countenance; &s;o that we made a very ludicrous ap|pearance and furni&s;hed a great deal of mirth for his ma|&s;ter and &s;hop-mates, who were witne&s;&s;es of this &s;cene.&mdash;When our mutual care&s;&s;es were over, I &s;at down again to be &s;haved, but the poor fellow's nerves were &s;o di&s;com|po&s;ed by this unexpected meeting, that his hand could &s;carcely hold the razor, with which (neverthele&s;s) he found means to cut me in three places, in as many &s;trokes. His ma&s;ter, perceiving his di&s;order, bade another &s;upply his place, and after the operation was performed, gave Strap leave to pa&s;s the re&s;t of the day with me. We re|tired immediately to my lodgings, where calling for &s;ome beer, I de&s;ired to be informed of his adventures, which contained nothing more than that his ma&s;ter dying be|fore his time was out, he had come to Newca&s;tle about a year ago, in expectation of journey work, along with three young fellows of his acquaintance who worked in the keels; that he had the good fortune of being employ|ed by a very civil ma&s;ter, with whom he purpo&s;ed to &s;tay till the &s;pring, at which time he intended to go to Lon|don, where he did not doubt of finding encouragement. When I communicated to him my &s;ituation and de&s;ign, he did not approve of my taking a pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea, by rea|&s;on of the danger of a winter voyage, which is very ha|zardous along that coa&s;t, as well as the precariou&s;ne&s;s of

the wind, which might po&s;&s;ibly detain me a great while to the no &s;mall detriment of my fortune: whereas, if I would venture by land he would bear me company, car|ry my baggage all the way; and if we &s;hould be fatigued before we could perform the journey, it would be no hard matter for us to find on the road, either returning hor&s;es or waggons, of which we might take the advantage for a very trifling expence. I was &s;o ravi&s;hed at this propo&s;al, that I embraced him affectionately, and a&s;&s;ured him he might command my pur&s;e to the la&s;t farthing; but he gave me to under&s;tand, he had &s;aved money &s;ufficient to an&s;wer his own occa&s;ions; and that he had a friend in London, who would &s;oon introduce him into bu&s;ine&s;s, in that capital; and might po&s;&s;ibly have it in his power to &s;erve me al&s;o.</P>
<P>Having concerted the plan and &s;ettled our affairs that night, we departed next morning by day-break, armed with a good cudgel each, (my companion being charged with the furniture of us both, crammed into one knap|&s;ack,) and our money &s;ewed between the lining and wai&s;t|band of our breeches, except &s;ome loo&s;e &s;ilver for our im|mediate expence on the road. We travelled all day at a round pace; but being ignorant of the proper &s;tages, were benighted at a good di&s;tance from any inn, &s;o that we were compelled to take up our lodgings at a &s;mall hedge ale-hou&s;e, that &s;tood on a bye-road, about half a mile from the highway; there we found a pedlar of our own country, in who&s;e company we regaled our&s;elves with bacon and eggs, and a gla&s;s of good ale, before a com|fortable fire, conver&s;ing all the while very &s;ociably with the landlord and his daughter, an hale buxom la&s;s, who en|tertained us with great good humour, and in who&s;e affection I was vain enough to believe I had made &s;ome progre&s;s. About eight o'clock, we were all three, at our own de|&s;ire, &s;hewn into an apartment, furni&s;hed with two beds, in one of which Strap and I betook our&s;elves to re&s;t, and the pedlar occupied the other, though not before he had prayed a con&s;iderable time <HI>extempore,</HI> &s;earched into every corner of the room, and fa&s;tened the door on the in&s;ide with a &s;trong iron &s;crew, which he carried about with him for that u&s;e. I &s;lept very &s;ound till midnight, when I was di&s;turbed by a violent motion of the bed, which
<PB N="37" REF="027715_0044_0FD5EB9FA8B98598">
&s;hook under me with a continual tremor. Alarmed at this phenomenon, I jogged my companion, whom, to my no &s;mall amazement, I found drenched in &s;weat, and quaking through every limb; he told me with a low &s;aultering voice, that we were undone; for there was a bloody highwayman with loaded pi&s;tols in the next room; then bidding me make as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, he di|rected me to a &s;mall chink in the board partition, through which I could &s;ee a thick&s;et brawny fellow, with a fierce countenance, &s;itting at a table with our young landlady, having a bottle of ale and a brace of pi&s;tols before him. I li&s;tened with great attention, and heard him &s;ay in a terrible tone: <Q>D&mdash;n that &s;on of a bitch, Smack the coachman!&mdash;he has &s;erved me a fine trick indeed!&mdash;but d&mdash;nation &s;eize me, if I don't make him repent it! I'll teach the &s;coundrel to give intelligence to others, while he is under articles with me.</Q>&mdash;Our landlady en|deavoured to appea&s;e this exa&s;perated robber, by &s;aying he might be mi&s;taken in Smack, who perhaps kept no corre&s;pondence with the other gentleman that robbed his coach&mdash;and that if an accident had di&s;appointed him to|day, he might &s;oon find opportunities enough to atone for his lo&s;t trouble. <Q>I'll tell thee what, my dear Bett, (replied he,) I never had, nor ever will, while my name is Rifle, have &s;uch a glorious booty as I mi&s;&s;ed to-day. Z&mdash;ds! there was four hundred pounds in ca&s;h, to recruit men for the king's &s;ervice, be&s;ides the jewels, watches, &s;words, and money belonging to the pa&s;&s;engers; had it been my fortune to have got clear off with &s;o much trea&s;ure, I would have purcha&s;ed a commi&s;&s;ion in the army, and made you an officer's lady, you jade, I would.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Well, well, (cries Betty,) we mu&s;t tru&s;t to providence for that; but did you find no|thing worth taking, which e&s;caped the other gentle|man of the road?</Q> <Q>Not much, faith, (&s;aid the lo|ver;) I gleaned a few things&mdash;&s;uch as a pair of pops, &s;ilver mounted, (here they are;) I took them loaded from the captain who had the charge of the money, together with a gold watch which he had concealed in his breeches.&mdash;I likewi&s;e found ten Portugal pieces in the &s;hoes of a Quaker, whom the &s;pirit moved to re|vile me with great bitterne&s;s and devotion; but what I

(&s;ays he) &s;pies, you b&mdash;ch! but no matter&mdash;I'll &s;end them all to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell in an in&s;tant.</Q> He accordingly ran towards our door; when his &s;weatheart interpo&s;ing, a&s;&s;ured him, there was only a couple of poor young Scotchmen, who were too raw and ignorant to give him the lea&s;t cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, and the third was a Pre&s;byterian pedlar of the &s;ame nation, who had often lodged in the hou&s;e before.&mdash;This declaration &s;atisfied the thief, who &s;wore he was glad there was a pedlar, for he wanted &s;ome linen.&mdash;Then in a jovial manner he put about the gla&s;s, mingling his di&s;cour&s;e to Betty with care&s;&s;es and familiarities, that &s;poke him very happy in his amours. During that part of the conver&s;a|tion which regarded us, Strap had crept under the bed, where he lay in the agonies of fear; &s;o that it was with great difficulty I per&s;uaded him our danger was over, and prevailed on him to wake the pedlar, and inform him of what he had &s;een and heard. The itinerant merchant no &s;ooner felt &s;omebody &s;haking him by the &s;houlder, than he &s;tarted up, calling as loud as he could&mdash;<Q>Thieves, thieves! Lord have mercy on us!</Q> And Rifle, alarmed at this exclamation, jumped up, cocked one of his pi&s;tols, and turned towards the door, to kill the fir&s;t man who &s;hould enter; for he verily believed him&s;elf be&s;et; when his Dulcinea, after an immoderate fit of laughter, per|&s;uaded him, that the poor pedlar, dreaming of thieves, had only cried out in his &s;leep.&mdash;Mean while my comrade had undeceived our fellow lodger, and informed him of his rea&s;on for di&s;turbing him; upon which getting up &s;oftly, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> through the hole, and was &s;o terrified with what he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aw, that falling down on his bare knees, he put up a long petition to heaven, to deliver him from the hands of that ruffian and promi&s;ed never to defraud a

cu&s;tomer for the future of the value of a pin's point, pro|vided he might be re&s;cued from the pre&s;ent danger. Whether or not the di&s;burthening his con&s;cience afforded him any ea&s;e, I know not; but he &s;lipt into bed again, and lay very quiet until the robber and his mi&s;tre&s;s were a&s;leep, and &s;nored in concert; then ri&s;ing &s;oftly, he un|tied a rope that was round his pack, which making fa&s;t to one end of it, he opened the window with as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, and lowered his goods into the yard with great dexterity; then he moved gently to our bed-&s;ide, and bade us farewel, telling us, that as we ran no ri&s;k, we might take our re&s;t with great confidence, and in the morning a&s;&s;ure the landlord that we knew nothing of his e&s;cape: and la&s;tly, &s;haking us by the hands, and wi&s;hing us all manner of &s;ucce&s;s, he let him&s;elf drop from the window without any danger, for the ground was not above a yard from his feet as he hung on the out&s;ide. Although I did not think proper to accompany him in his flight, I was not at all free from apprehen&s;ion, when I reflected on what might be the effect of the highwayman's di&s;ap|pointment; as he certainly intended to make free with the pedlar's ware. Neither was my companion at more ea&s;e in his mind; but on the contrary &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the dreadful idea of Rifle, that he &s;olicited me &s;trongly to follow our countryman's example, and &s;o elude the fa|tal re&s;entment of that terrible adventurer, who would certainly wreak his vengeance on us, as accomplices of the pedlar's elopement. But I repre&s;ented to him the danger of giving Rifle cau&s;e to think we knew his profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;ugge&s;ted, that if ever he &s;hould meet us again on the road, he would look upon us as dangerous acquaintance, and find it his intere&s;t to put us out of the way. I told him withal, my confidence in Betty's good nature; in which he acquie&s;ced, and during the remaining part of the night, we concerted a proper method of behaviour, to render us un&s;u&s;pected in the morning.</P>
<P>It was no &s;ooner day, than Betty, entering our cham|ber, and perceiving our window open, cried out, <Q>Odds bobs! &s;ure you Scotchmen mu&s;t have hot con&s;titutions, to lie all night with the window open, in &s;uch cold weather.</Q> I feigned to &s;tart out of &s;leep, and with|drawing the curtain, called, "What's the matter?"
<PB N="40" REF="027715_0047_0FD5EBA6642C0A50">
When &s;he &s;hewed me, I affected &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;aid, <Q>Ble&s;s me! the window was &s;hut when we went to bed.</Q> <Q>I'll be hanged, (&s;aid &s;he,) if Sawney Waddle, the ped|lar has not got up in a dream and done it, for I heard him very ob&s;tropulous in his &s;leep&punc;&mdash;Sure I put a cham|ber pot under his bed.</Q>&mdash;With the&s;e words &s;he advan|ced to the bed in which he lay, and finding the &s;heets cold, exclaimed, "Good lack a dai&s;y! the rogue is fled!" <Q>&mdash;Fled!

While we were at breakfa&s;t, Betty endeavoured by all the cunning &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of, to learn whether or no we &s;u&s;pected our fel|low lodger, whom we &s;aw take hor&s;e; but as we were on our guard, we an&s;wered her &s;ly que&s;tions with a &s;implicity &s;he could not di&s;tru&s;t; when all of a &s;udden we heard the trampling of a hor&s;e's feet at the door. This noi&s;e alarm|ed Strap &s;o much, who&s;e imagination was wholly engro&s;|&s;ed by the image of Rifle, that with a countenance as pale as milk, he cried, <Q>O Lord! there's the highway|man returned!</Q>&mdash;Our landlady &s;taring at the&s;e words, &s;aid, <Q>What highwayman, young man?&mdash;Do you think any highwaymen harbour here?</Q>&mdash;Though I was very much di&s;concerted at this piece of indi&s;cretion in Strap, I had pre&s;ence of mind enough to tell her, we had

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER having paid our &s;core, and taken leave of our ho&s;te&s;s, who embraced me tenderly at parting, we proceeded on our journey, ble&s;&s;ing our&s;elves that we had come off &s;o well. We had not walked above five miles, when we ob&s;erved a man on hor&s;eback galloping after us, who we in a &s;hort time recognized to be no other than this formidable hero who had already given us &s;o much vexation. He &s;topped hard by me, and a&s;ked if I knew who he was?&mdash;My a&s;toni&s;hment had di&s;concerted me &s;o much, that I did not hear his que&s;tion, which he repeat|ed with a volley of oaths and threats; but I remained as mute as before. Strap &s;eeing my di&s;compo&s;ure, fell upon his knees in the mud, uttering with a lamentable voice, the&s;e words: <Q>For Ch&mdash;&s;t's &s;ake, have mercy upon us, Mr. Rifle, we know you very well.</Q>&mdash;<Q>O ho! (cried the thief,) you do!&mdash;But you &s;hall never be evidence again&s;t me in this world, you dog!</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying, he drew a pi&s;tol, and fired it at the unfortunate &s;haver, who &s;ell flat upon the ground without &s;peaking one word.&mdash;My comrade's &s;ate, and my own &s;ituation, rivetted me to the place where I &s;tood, deprived of all &s;en&s;e and re|flection; &s;o that I did not make the lea&s;t attempt either to run away, or deprecate the wrath of this barbarian, who &s;napped a &s;econd pi&s;tol at me; but before he had time to prime again, perceiving a company of hor&s;eme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> coming up, he rode off, and le&s;t me &s;tanding, motionle&s;s as a &s;tatue, in which po&s;ture I was found by tho&s;e who&s;e
<PB N="42" REF="027715_0049_0FD5EBAB9D806610">
appearance had &s;aved my life. This company con&s;i&s;ted of three men in livery, well armed, with an officer, who (as I afterwards learned) was the per&s;on from whom Rifle had taken the pocket pi&s;tols the day before; and who making known his misfortune to a nobleman he met on the road, and a&s;&s;uring him, his non-re&s;i&s;tance was altoge|ther owing to his con&s;ideration for the ladies in the coach, procured the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Lord&s;hip's &s;ervants to go in que&s;t of the plunderer. This holiday captain &s;campered up to me with great addre&s;s, and a&s;ked who fired the pi&s;tol which he had heard. As I had not yet recovered my rea&s;on, he, before I could an&s;wer, ob&s;erved a body lying upon the ground; at which &s;ight his colour changed, and he pronounced with a faultering tongue, <Q>Gentle|men, here's murder committed! let us alight.</Q> <Q>No, no, (&s;aid one of his followers,) let us rather pur&s;ue the murderer.&mdash;Which way went he, young man?</Q> By this time I had recollected my&s;elf &s;o far as to tell them he could not be a quarter of a mile before; and to beg one of them to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in conveying the corp&s;e of my friend to the next hou&s;e, in order to its being interred.&mdash;The captain fore&s;eeing, that in ca&s;e he &s;hould pur&s;ue, he mu&s;t &s;oon come to action, began to curb his hor&s;e, and gave him the &s;pur at the &s;ame time, which treatment making the creature rear up and &s;nort, he called out, his hor&s;e was frightened and would not proceed; at the &s;ame time wheeling him round and round, &s;troking his neck, whi&s;tling and wheedling him with <Q>Sirrah, &s;irrah&mdash;gent|ly, gently, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>&mdash;<Q>Zounds! (cried one of the &s;ervants,) &s;ure my Lord's Sorrel is not re&s;ty!</Q>&mdash;With the&s;e words, he be&s;towed a la&s;h on his buttock, and Sorrel, di&s;daining the rein, &s;prung forward with the captain at a pace that would have &s;oon brought him up with the rob|ber, had not the girth (happily for him) given way, by which means he landed in the dirt; and two of his at|tendants continued their pur&s;uit, without minding his &s;ituation. Meanwhile one of the three who remained at my de&s;ire, turning the body of Strap, in order to &s;ee the wound which had killed him, found him &s;till warm and breathing; upon which I immediately let him blood, and &s;aw him with inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, recover; he having re|ceived no other wound than what his fear had inflicted.
<PB N="43" REF="027715_0050_0FD5EBABA2A61A18">
Having rai&s;ed him upon his legs, we walked together to an inn, about half a mile from the place, where Strap, who was not quite recovered, went to bed; and in a little time the third &s;ervant returned with the captain's hor&s;e and furniture, leaving him to crawl after as well as he could. This gentleman of the &s;word, upon his arrival, complained grievou&s;ly of the brui&s;e occa&s;ioned by his fall; and on the recommendation of his &s;ervant, who warranted my ability, I was employed to bleed him, for which &s;er|vice he rewarded me with half-a-crown.</P>
<P>The time between this event and dinner I pa&s;&s;ed in ob|&s;erving a game at cards between two farmers, an exci&s;e|man, and a young fellow in a ru&s;ty gown and ca&s;&s;ock, who, as I afterwards under&s;tood, was curate of a neighbouring pari&s;h. It was ea&s;y to perceive that the match was not equal, and that the two farmers, who were partners, had to do with a couple of &s;harpers, who &s;tript them of all their ca&s;h in a very &s;hort time. But what &s;urpri&s;ed me very much was to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this clergyman reply to one of the coun|trymen, who &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pect foul play, in tho&s;e words, "D&mdash;n me, friend, d'ye que&s;tion my honour?" I did not at all wonder to find a cheat in canonicals, this being a character frequent in my own country; but I was &s;can|dalized at the indecency of his behaviour, which appeared in the oaths he &s;wore, and the bawdy &s;ongs which he &s;ung. At la&s;t, to make amends in &s;ome &s;ort for the damage he had done to the unwary boors, he pulled out a fiddle from the lining of his gown, and, promi&s;ing to treat them at dinner, began to play mo&s;t melodiou&s;ly, &s;inging in concert all the while. This good humour of the par&s;on in&s;pired the company with &s;o much glee, that the farmers &s;oon forgot their lo&s;&s;es, and all pre&s;ent went to dancing in the yard. While we were agreeably amu&s;ed in this manner, our mu&s;ician, &s;pying a hor&s;eman riding towards the inn, &s;topped all of a &s;udden, crying out, <Q>Gad &s;o! gentlemen, I beg your pardon; there's our dog of a doctor coming into the inn.</Q> He immediately concealed his in&s;tru|ment, and ran towards the gate, where he took hold of the vicar's bridle, and helped him off, inquiring very cor|dially into the &s;tate of his health. This ro&s;y &s;on of the church (who might be about the age of fifty) having alighted, and intru&s;ted the curate with his hor&s;e, &s;talked

with great &s;olemnity into the kitchen, where, &s;itting down by the fire, he called for a bottle of ale and a pipe, &s;carce deigning an an&s;wer to the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive que&s;tions of tho&s;e who enquired about the welfare of his family. While he indulged him&s;elf in this &s;tate, amid&s;t a profound &s;ilence, the curate, approaching him with great reverence, a&s;ked him if he would not be plea&s;ed to honour us with his com|pany at dinner? To which interrogation he an&s;wered in the negative, &s;aying, he had been to vi&s;it Squire Bumpkin, who had drank him&s;elf into a high fever at the la&s;t a&s;&s;izes, and that he had, on leaving his own hou&s;e, told Betty he &s;hould dine at home. Accordingly, when he had made an end of his bottle and pipe, he ro&s;e, and moved with pre|latical dignity to the door, where his journeyman &s;tood ready with his nag. He had no &s;ooner mounted, than the facetious curate, coming into the kitchen, held forth in this manner: <Q>There the old ra&s;cal goes, and the D&mdash;l go with him.&mdash;You &s;ee how the world wags, gentle|men.&mdash;By Gad, this rogue of a vicar does not de&s;erve to live; and yet he has two livings worth 400 <HI>l. per annum,</HI> while poor I am fain to do all his drudgery, and ride twenty miles every Sunday to preach&mdash;for what? why, truly, for 20 <HI>l.</HI> a-year. I &s;corn to boa&s;t of my own qualifications; but&mdash;compari&s;ons are odious. I &s;hould be glad to know how this &s;wag-bellied doctor de&s;erves to be more at ea&s;e than me. He can loll in his elbow chair at home, indulge him&s;elf in the be&s;t of victuals and wine, and enjoy the conver&s;ation of Betty his hou&s;ekeeper.&mdash;You under&s;tand me, gentlemen.&mdash;Betty is the doctor's poor kin&s;woman, and a pretty girl &s;he is; but no matter for that: ay, and a dutiful girl to her parents, whom &s;he vi&s;its regularly every year, tho' I mu&s;t own I could never learn in what county they live&mdash;My &s;ervice t'ye, gentlemen.</Q> By this time, din|ner being ready, I waked my companion, and we eat all together with great cheerfulne&s;s. When our meal was ended, and every man's &s;hare of the reckoning adju&s;ted, the curate went out on pretence of &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion, and, mounting his hor&s;e, left the two farmers to &s;atisfy the ho&s;t in the be&s;t manner they could. We were no &s;oon|er informed of this piece of fine&s;&s;e than the exci&s;eman, who had been &s;ilent hitherto, began to open with a malicious

You mu&s;t know this is a very curious fellow&mdash;he picked up &s;ome &s;craps of learning while he &s;erved young Lord Trifle at the univer&s;ity. But what he mo&s;t excels in is pimping. No man knows his talents better than I; for I was valet de chambre to Squire Tattle, an in|timate companion of Shuffle's lord. He got him&s;elf into a &s;crape by pawning &s;ome of his lord&s;hip's clothes, on which account he was turned away; but, as he was acquainted with &s;ome particular circum&s;tances of my lord's conduct, he did not care to exa&s;perate him too much, and &s;o made intere&s;t for his receiving orders, and afterwards recommended him to the curacy which he now enjoys. However, the fellow cannot be too much admired for his dexterity in making a comfortable live|lihood in &s;pite of &s;uch a &s;mall allowance.

This did not &s;atisfy the other, who taxed him with abetting and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing the curate's knavery, and in&s;i&s;ted on having his &s;hare of the winnings returned; this demand the exci&s;eman as po&s;itively refu&s;ed, affirming, that, whatever &s;lights Shuf|fle might practi&s;e on other occa&s;ions, he was very certain, that he had played on the &s;quare with them, and would an&s;wer it before any bench in Chri&s;tendom; &s;o &s;aying, he got up, and, having paid his reckoning, &s;neaked off.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>STRAP and I were about to depart on our journey, when we perceived a crowd on the road coming to|wards us &s;houting and hallooing all the way. As it ap|proached, we could di&s;cern a man on hor&s;eback in the middle, with his hands tied behind him, whom we &s;oon knew to be Rifle. This highwayman, not being &s;o well mounted as the two &s;ervants who went in pur&s;uit of him, was &s;oon overtaken, and, after having di&s;charged his pi|&s;tols, was made pri&s;oner without any farther oppo&s;ition. They were carrying him in triumph, amid&s;t the acclama|tions of the country people, to a ju&s;tice of peace in a neigh|bouring village, but &s;topped at our inn to join their com|panion, and take refre&s;hment. When Rifle was di&s;mounted, and placed in the yard within a circle of pea&s;ants armed with pitchforks, I was amazed to &s;ee what a pitiful dejected fellow he now appeared, who had but a few hours before filled me with terror and confu&s;ion. My companion was &s;o much encouraged by this alteration in his appearance, that, going up to thief, he pre&s;ented his clenched fi&s;ts to his no&s;e, and declared, he would either cudgel or box with the pri&s;oner for a guinea, which he immediately pro|duced, and began to &s;trip&mdash;but was di&s;&s;uaded from his adventure by me, who repre&s;ented to him the folly of the undertaking, as Rifle was now in the hands of ju&s;tice, which would no doubt give us all &s;atisfaction enough. But what made me repent of our impertinent curio&s;ity, was our being detained by the captors as evidence again&s;t him, when we were ju&s;t going to &s;et forward. However, there was no remedy; we were obliged to comply, and
<PB N="47" REF="027715_0054_0FD5EBB3F3E3EB98">
accordingly joined in the cavalcade, which luckily took the &s;ame road that we had propo&s;ed to follow. About twilight we arrived at the place of our de&s;tination; but as the ju&s;tice was gone to vi&s;it a gentleman in the coun|try, with whom (we under&s;tood) he would probably &s;tay all night, the robber was confined in an empty garret three &s;tories high, from which it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible for him to e&s;cape; however, next morning, when they went up &s;tairs to bring him before the ju&s;tice, the bird was flown, having got out at the window upon the roof, from whence he continued his rout along the tops of the adjoining hou&s;es, and entered another garret-win|dow, where he &s;culked until the family were a&s;leep, at which time he ventured down &s;tairs, and let him&s;elf out by the &s;treet-door, which was found open. This event was a great di&s;appointment to tho&s;e that apprehended him, who were flu&s;hed with the hopes of the reward, but gave me great joy, as I was permitted now to continue my journey without any farther mole&s;tation. Re&s;olving to make up for the &s;mall progre&s;s we had hitherto made, we this day travelled with great vigour, and, before night, reached a market-town twenty miles from the place from whence we &s;et out in the morning, without meeting any adventure worth notice. Here, having taken up our lodg|ing at an inn, I found my&s;elf &s;o fatigued, that I began to de&s;pair of performing our journey on foot, and de&s;ired Strap to inquire if there were any waggon, return-hor&s;es, or other cheap carriage in this place, to depart for Lon|don next day. He was informed that the waggon from Newca&s;tle to London had halted here two nights ago, and that it would be an ea&s;y matter to overtake it, if not the next day, at farthe&s;t the day after. This piece of news gave us &s;ome &s;atisfaction; and, after having made a hearty &s;upper on ha&s;hed mutton, we were &s;hewn to our room, which contained two beds; the one allotted for us, and the other for a very hone&s;t gentleman, who, we were told, was then drinking below. Though we could have very well di&s;pen&s;ed with his company, we were glad to &s;ubmit to this di&s;po&s;ition, as there was not another bed empty in the hou&s;e, and accordingly went to re&s;t, after having &s;e|cured our baggage under the bol&s;ter. About two or three o'clock in the morning I was waked out of a very profound
<PB N="48" REF="027715_0055_0FD5EBB562587718">
&s;leep by a dreadful noi&s;e in the chamber, which did not fail to throw me into an agony of con&s;ternation, when I heard the&s;e words pronounced with a terrible voice&mdash;<Q>Blood and wounds! run the halbert into the guts of him that's next you, and I'll blow the other's brains out pre&s;ently.</Q>&mdash;This dreadful &s;alutation had no &s;ooner reached the ears of Strap, than &s;tarting out of bed, he ran again&s;t &s;omebody in the dark, and overturned him in an in&s;tant; at the &s;ame time bawling out, "Fire! mur|der! fire!" a cry which in a moment alarmed the whole hou&s;e, and filled our chamber with a crowd of na|ked people.&mdash;When lights were brought, the occa&s;ion of all this di&s;turbance &s;oon appeared; which was no other than our fellow-lodger, whom we found lying on the floor &s;cratching his head, with a look te&s;tifying the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, at the concour&s;e of apparitions that &s;ur|rounded him.&mdash;This hone&s;t gentleman was, it &s;eems, a recruiting &s;erjeant, who having inli&s;ted two country-fel|lows over-night, dreamed that they had mutined, and threatened to murder him and the drummer who was along with him. This made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on his imagi|nation, that he got up in his &s;leep, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as above. When our apprehen&s;ion of danger vani&s;hed, the company beheld one another with great &s;urpri&s;e and mirth; but what attracted the notice of every one, was our landlady with nothing on her but her &s;hift and a large pair of buck-&s;kin breeches with the back&s;ide before, which &s;he had &s;lipt on in the hurry, and her hu&s;band with her petticoat about his &s;houlders. One had wrapt him&s;elf in a blanket; another was covered with a &s;heet; and the drummer, who had given his only &s;hirt to be wa&s;hed, ap|peared <HI>in cuerpo</HI> with the bol&s;ter rolled about his middle. When this affair was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, every body retired to his own apartment, the &s;erjeant &s;lipt into bed, and my com|panion and I &s;lept without any farther di&s;turbance till morning, when we got up, went to breakfa&s;t, paid our reckoning, and &s;et forward in expectation of overtaking the waggon; in which hope, however, we were di&s;ap|pointed for that day. As we exerted our&s;elves more than u&s;ual, I found my&s;elf quite &s;pent with fatigue, when we entered a &s;mall village in the twilight. We inquired for
<PB N="49" REF="027715_0056_0FD5EBB6E1BDD910">
a public-hou&s;e, and were directed to one of a very &s;orry ap|pearance. At our entrance the landlord, who &s;eemed to be a venerable old man with long grey hair, ro&s;e from a table placed by a large fire in a very neat paved kitchen, and with a chearful countenance acco&s;ted us in the&s;e words: <HI>"Salvete pueri&mdash;ingredimini."</HI> I was not a little plea&s;ed to hear our ho&s;t &s;peak Latin, becau&s;e I was in hope of recommending my&s;elf to him by my knowledge in that language; I therefore an&s;wered without he&s;itation&mdash;<HI><Q>Di&s;|&s;olve frigus, ligna &s;uper foco&mdash;large reponens.</Q></HI> I had no &s;ooner pronounced the&s;e words, than the old gentleman, running towards me, &s;hook me by the hand, crying, <HI><Q>Fili mi delecti&s;&s;ime! unde venis!&mdash;a &s;uperis ni fallor?</Q></HI> In &s;hort, finding we were both read in the cla&s;&s;ics, he did not know how to te&s;tify his regard enough, but ordered his daugh|ter, a jolly-ro&s;y-cheeked dam&s;el, who was his &s;ole dome|&s;tic, to bring us a bottle of his <HI>quadrimum</HI>&mdash;repeating from Horace at the &s;ame time, <HI><Q>Deprome quadrimum, S&aacute;|bina, O Thaliarche merum diot&acirc;.</Q></HI> This <HI>quadrimum</HI> was excellent ale of his own brewing, of which he told us he had always an <HI>amphora,</HI> four years old, for the u&s;e of him&s;elf and friends. In the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation, which was interlarded with &s;craps of Latin, we under&s;tood that this facetious per&s;on was a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, who&s;e in|come being &s;mall, he was fain to keep a gla&s;s of good li|quor for the entertainment of pa&s;&s;engers, by which means he made &s;hift to make the two ends of the year meet. <Q>I am this day, &s;aid he, the happie&s;t old fellow in his Maje&s;ty's dominions. My wife, re&s;t her &s;oul, is in hea|ven: my daughter is to be married next week&mdash;but the two chief plea&s;ures of my life are th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e,</Q> (pointing to the bottle and a large edition of Horace that lay on the table.)&mdash;<Q>I am old, 'tis true&mdash;what then? the more rea|&s;on I &s;hould enjoy the &s;mall &s;hare of life that remains, as my friend Flaccus advi&s;es: <HI>Tu ne quae&s;ieris &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire (ne|fas)&mdash;Quem mihi, quem tibi finem dii dederint&mdash;Carpe diem quam minimum credula po&s;tero.</HI></Q> As he was very inqui&s;itive about our affairs, we made no &s;cruple of ac|quainting him with our &s;ituation, which, when he had learned, he inriched us with advices how to behave in the world, telling us he was no &s;tranger to the deceits of man|kind.
<PB N="50" REF="027715_0057_0FD5EBB85DCE4790">
In the mean time he ordered his daughter to lay a fowl to the fire for &s;upper; for he was re&s;olved this night to regale his friends&mdash;<HI>permittens divis caetera.</HI> While our entertainment was preparing, our ho&s;t recounted the ad|ventures of his own life, which, as they contain nothing remarkable, I forbear to rehear&s;e. When we had fared &s;umptuou&s;ly, and drank &s;everal bottles of his <HI>quadrimum,</HI> I expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of going to re&s;t, which was with &s;ome difficulty complied with, after he had informed us that we &s;hould overtake the waggon by noon next day; and that there was room enough in it for half a dozen, for there were only four pa&s;&s;engers as yet in that conveyance. Be|fore my comrade and I fell a&s;leep we had &s;ome conver&s;a|tion about the good humour of our landlord, which gave Strap &s;uch an idea of his benevolence, that he po&s;itively believed we &s;hould pay nothing for our lodging and en|tertainment. "Don't you ob&s;erve," &s;aid he, <Q>that he has conceived a particular affection for us?&mdash;nay, even treated us at &s;upper with extraordinary fare, which, to be &s;ure, we &s;hould not of our&s;elves have called for?</Q> I was partly of Strap's opinion; but the experience I had of the world made me &s;u&s;pend my belief till the morning, when, getting up betimes, we breakfa&s;ted with our ho&s;t and his daughter on ha&s;ty-pudding and ale, and de&s;ired to know what we had to pay.&mdash;<Q>Biddy will let you know, gentlemen,</Q> &s;aid he; <Q>for I never mind the&s;e mat|ters. Money-matters are beneath the concern of one who lives on the Horatian plan&mdash;<HI>Cre&s;centem &s;equitur cura pecuniam.</HI></Q> Meanwhile Biddy, having con&s;ulted a &s;late that hung in a corner, told us our reckoning came to 8<HI>s.</HI> 7<HI>d.</HI>&mdash;"Eight &s;hillings and &s;evenpence!" cried Strap; <Q>'tis impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;you mu&s;t be mi&s;taken, young woman.</Q>&mdash;"Reckon again, child," &s;ays her father very deliberately, "perhaps you have mi&s;counted."&mdash;"No indeed, father," &s;he replied, <Q>I know my bu&s;ine&s;s better.</Q> I could contain my indignation no longer, but &s;aid it was an uncon&s;cionable bill, and demanded to know the particulars; upon which the old man got up, muttering, <Q>Ay, ay, let us &s;ee the particulars&mdash;that's but rea&s;onable;</Q> and taking pen, ink, and paper, wrote the following <HI>items.</HI>

As he had not the appearance of a common publican, and had rai&s;ed a &s;ort of veneration in me by his demeanour the preceding night, it was not in my power to upbraid him as he de&s;erved; therefore I contented my&s;elf with &s;aying, I was &s;ure he did not learn to be an extortioner from Ho|race.

Ju&s;t as we departed, Strap, who was half di&s;tracted on account of this piece of expence, went up to the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, and, grinning in his face, pronounced with great empha&s;is, <HI>"Semper avarus eget."</HI> To which the pedant replied with a malicious &s;mile, <HI>"Animum rege, qui, ni&s;i paret, imperat."</HI></P>

<P>We de&s;cry the waggon&mdash;get into it&mdash;arrive at an inn&mdash;our fellow-travellers de&s;cribed&mdash;a mi&s;take is committed by Strap, which produces &s;trange things.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE travelled half a mile without exchanging one word, my thoughts being ingro&s;&s;ed by the knavery of the world, to which I mu&s;t be daily expo&s;ed, and the contemplation of my finances, which began &s;en&s;ibly to di|mini&s;h.
<PB N="52" REF="027715_0059_0FD5EBBF24701060">
At length Strap, who could hold no longer, addre&s;&s;ed me thus: <Q>Well, fools and their money are &s;oon parted. If my advice had been taken, that old &s;kin-flint &s;hould have been d&mdash;d before he had got more than the third of his demand.&mdash;'Tis a &s;ure &s;ign you came ea&s;ily by your money, when you &s;quander it away in this manner. Ah! God help you, how many bri&s;ly beards mu&s;t I have mowed before I earned four &s;hillings and threepence halfpenny, which is all thrown to the dogs? How many days have I &s;at weaving hair, till my toes were numbed by the cold, my fingers cramped, and my no&s;e as blue as the &s;ign of the periwig that hung over the door? What the devil was you afraid of? I would have engaged to box with any one of tho&s;e fellows, who came in for a guinea. I'm &s;ure I have beat &s;touter men than either of them.</Q> And indeed, my companion would have &s;ought any body when his life was in no danger; but he had a mortal aver&s;ion to fire|arms, and all in&s;truments of death. In order to appea&s;e him, I a&s;&s;ured him, no part of this extraordinary expence &s;hould fall upon his &s;houlders; at which declaration he was affronted, and told me he would have me to know, that, although he was a poor barber's boy, he had a &s;oul to &s;pend his money with the be&s;t &s;quire of the land.</P>
<P>Having walked all day at a great pace, without halting for a refre&s;hment, we de&s;cribed towards the evening, to our inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, the waggon about a quarter of a mile before us, and by that time we reached it, were both &s;o weary, that I verily believe it would have been impracti|cable for us to have walked one mile farther. We there|fore bargained with the driver, who&s;e name was Joey, to give us a ca&s;t to the next &s;tage for a &s;hilling, at which place we &s;hould meet the ma&s;ter of the waggon, with whom we might agree for the re&s;t of the journey.</P>
<P>Accordingly the convenience &s;topt, and, Joey having placed the ladder, Strap (being loaded with our baggage) mounted fir&s;t; but, ju&s;t as he was getting in, a tremendous voice a&s;&s;ailed his ears in the&s;e words: <Q>God's &s;ury! there &s;hall no pa&s;&s;engers come here.</Q> The poor &s;haver was &s;o di&s;concerted at this exclamation, which both he and I imagined proceeded from the mouth of a giant, that he de&s;cended with great velocity, and a countenance as white
<PB N="53" REF="027715_0060_0FD5EBC0A0525290">
as paper. Joey, perceiving our a&s;toni&s;hment, called with an arch &s;neer, <Q>Waounds, coptain, whay waon't you &s;oof|fer the poor waggoneer to meake a penny?&mdash;Coom, coom, young man, get oop, get oop, never moind the coptain. I'&s;e not afraid of the coptain.</Q> This was not encouragement &s;ufficient to Strap, who could not be pre|vailed upon to venture up again; upon which I attempted, though not without a quaking heart, when I heard the &s;ame voice muttering like di&s;tant thunder&mdash;<Q>Hell and the devil confound me, if I don't make you &s;mart for this!</Q> However, I crept in, and by accident got an empty place in the &s;traw, which I immediately took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of, without being able to di&s;cern the faces of my fellow-travellers in the dark. Strap, following with the knap&s;ack on his back, chanced to take the other &s;ide, and, by a jolt of the carriage, pitched directly upon the &s;tomach of the captain, who bellowed out in a mo&s;t dread|ful manner:&mdash;"Blood and thunder! where's my &s;word?" At the&s;e words my frighted comrade &s;tarted up, and at one &s;pring bounced again&s;t me with &s;uch force, that I thought he was the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;on of Anak, who intended to pre&s;s me to death. In the mean time a female voice cried, "Ble&s;s me! What is the matter, my dear?"&mdash;"The matter," replied the captain; <Q>damn my blood! my guts are &s;queezed into a pancake by that Scotch|man's hump.</Q> Strap trembling all the while at my back, a&s;ked him pardon, and laid all the blame of what had happened upon the jolting of the waggon: and the woman who &s;poke before went on: <Q>Ay, ay, my dear, it is our own fault; we may thank our&s;elves for all the inconveniences we meet with. I thank God I never tra|velled &s;o before&mdash;I'm &s;ure if my lady or Sir John was to know where we are, they would not &s;leep this night for vexation&mdash;I wi&s;h to God we had writ for the cha|riot: I know we &s;hall never be forgiven.</Q> "Come, come, my dear," replied the captain, <Q>it don't &s;ignify fretting now&mdash;we &s;hall laugh it over as a frolic&mdash;I hope you will not &s;uffer in your health. I &s;hall make my lord very merry with our adventures in the Diligence.</Q> This di&s;cour&s;e gave me &s;uch a high notion of the captain and his lady, that I dur&s;t not venture to join in the con|ver&s;ation; but, immediately after, another female voice

began; <Q>Some people give them&s;elves a great many need|le&s;s airs&mdash;better folks than any here have travelled in waggons before now. Some of us have rode in coaches and chariots with three footmen behind them, without making &s;o much fu&s;s about it&mdash;What then? we are now all upon a footing; therefore let us be &s;ociable and merry. What do you &s;ay, I&s;aac? Is not this a good motion, you doating rogue?&mdash;Speak, you old <HI>cent. per cent.</HI> fornicator. What de&s;perate debt are you think|ing of? What mortgage are you planning? Well, I&s;aac, po&s;itively you &s;hall never gain my favour till you turn over a new leaf; grow hone&s;t, and live like a gentle|man. In the mean time give me a ki&s;s, you old fum|bler.</Q> The&s;e words accompanied with a hearty &s;mack, enlivened the per&s;on, to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed, to &s;uch a degree, that he cried in a tran&s;port, though with a faul|tering voice, <Q>Ah! you wanton baggage&mdash;upon my cre|dit you are a waggi&s;h girl, he, he, he.</Q> This laugh introduced a fit of coughing, which almo&s;t &s;uffocated the poor u&s;urer, (&s;uch we afterwards found was the profe&s;&s;ion of this our fellow-traveller.) About this time I fell a&s;leep, and enjoyed a comfortable nap till &s;uch time as we arrived at the inn where we put up. Here, having alighted from the waggon, I had an opportunity of viewing the pa&s;&s;en|gers in order as they entered. The fir&s;t who appeared was a brisk airy girl, about twenty years old, with a &s;ilver laced hat on her head in&s;tead of a cap, a blue &s;tuff riding &s;uit trimmed with &s;ilver, very much tarni&s;hed, and a whip in her hand. After her came limping an old man, with a wor&s;ted night-cap buttoned under his chin, and a broad|brimmed hat &s;louched over it, an old ru&s;ty blue cloak tied about his neck, under which appeared a brown &s;urtout that covered a thread-bare coat and wai&s;t-coat, and, as we afterwards di&s;cerned, a dirty flannel jacket; his eyes were hollow, bleared and gummy; his face was &s;hrivelled into a thou&s;and wrinkles; his gums were de&s;titute of teeth; his no&s;e &s;harp and drooping; his chin peaked and promi|nent; &s;o that, when he mumped or &s;poke, they approach|ed one another like a pair of nut-crackers: he &s;upported him&s;elf on an ivory-beaded cane, and his whole figure was a ju&s;t emblem of winter, famine, and avarice. But how was I &s;urprized, when I beheld the formidable captain in
<PB N="55" REF="027715_0062_0FD5EBCA49407438">
the &s;hape of a little thin creature, about the age of forty, with a long withered vi&s;age very much re&s;embling that of a baboon, through the upper part of which two little grey eyes peeped: he wore his own hair in a queu that reached to his rump, which immoderate length, I &s;uppo&s;e, was the occa&s;ion of a baldne&s;s that appeared on the crown of his head, when he deigned to take off his hat, which was very much of the &s;ize and cock of Pi&s;tol's. Having laid a&s;ide his great coat, I could not help admiring the extraordinary make of this man of war: he was about five feet and three inches high, &s;ix|teen inches of which went to his face and long &s;craggy neck, his thighs were about &s;ix inches in length, his legs re&s;embling &s;pindles or drum-&s;ticks, two feet and a half, and his body, which put me in mind of exten&s;ion without &s;ub&s;tance, engro&s;&s;ed the remainder;&mdash;&s;o that on the whole he appeared like a &s;pider or gra&s;hopper erect&mdash;and was almo&s;t a <HI>vox &amp; praeterea nihil.</HI> His dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of a frock of what is called bear &s;kin, the &s;kirts of which were about half a foot long, an hu&s;&s;ar wai&s;tcoat, &s;carlet breeches reaching half way down his thigh, wor&s;ted &s;tock|ings rolled up almo&s;t to his groin, and &s;hoes with wood|en heels at lea&s;t two inches high; he carried a &s;word very near as long as him&s;elf in one hand, and with the other conducted his lady, who &s;eemed to be a woman of his own age, and &s;till retained &s;ome remains of an agreeable per&s;on; but &s;o ridiculou&s;ly affected, that had I not been a novice in the world, I might have ea&s;ily perceived in her the deplorable vanity and &s;econd hand airs of a lady's woman.&mdash;We were all a&s;&s;embled in the kitchen, when Captain Weazle (for that was his name) de&s;ired a room with a fire for him&s;elf and &s;pou&s;e; and told the landlord, they would &s;up by them&s;elves. The inn-keeper replied, that he could not afford them a room by them&s;elves; and, as for &s;upping, he had prepared victuals for the pa&s;&s;engers in the waggon, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons; but if he could prevail on the re&s;t to let him have his choice in a &s;eparate manner, he &s;hould be very well plea&s;ed. This was &s;ooner &s;aid, than all of us declared again&s;t the pro|po&s;al, and Mi&s;s Jenny (our other female pa&s;&s;enger) ob|&s;erved, that if Captain Weazle and his lady had a mind to &s;up by them&s;elves, they might wait until we &s;hould

have done. At this hint, the captain put on a martial frown, and looked very big, without &s;peaking; while his yoke-fellow with a di&s;dainful to&s;s of her no&s;e, muttered &s;omething about "creature;"&mdash;which Mi&s;s Jenny over|hearing, &s;tept up to her, &s;aying, <Q>None of your names, good Mrs. Abigail;&mdash;creature, quotha!&mdash;I'll a&s;&s;ure you&mdash;no &s;uch creature as you neither&mdash;no ten pound &s;neak|er&mdash;no quality coupler.</Q>&mdash;Here the captain interpo&s;ed with a "Damme, madam, what do you mean by that?"&mdash;<Q>Damn you, Sir, who are you? (replied Mi&s;s Jen|ny;) who made you a captain, you pitiful, trencher|&s;craping, pimping &s;coundrel?&mdash;'Sdeath! the army is come to a fine pa&s;s, when &s;uch fellows as you get commi&s;|&s;ions.&mdash;What, I &s;uppo&s;e you think I don't know you?&mdash;Agad, you and your helpmate are well met&mdash;a ca&s;t|off mi&s;tre&s;s and a bald <HI>valet de chambre</HI> are well yoked together.</Q> <Q>Blood and wounds!

I would have his liver for my &s;upper.</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying, he drew his &s;word and flouri&s;hed with it, to the great terror to Strap; while Mi&s;s Jenny &s;napping her fingers, told him, &s;he did not value his re&s;entment a lou&s;e.&mdash;In the mid&s;t of this quarrel, the ma&s;ter of the wagon alighted, who under&s;tanding the cau&s;e of the di&s;turbance, and fearing the captain and his lady would take umbrage, and leave his carriage, was at great pains to have every thing made up, which he at la&s;t accompli&s;hed, and we &s;at down to &s;upper all together. At bed-time we were &s;hewed to our apartments: the old u&s;urer, Strap and I, to one room; the captain, his wife, and Mi&s;s Jenny, to another.&mdash;About midnight, my companion's bowels be|ing di&s;ordered, he got up, in order to go backward; but, in his return, mi&s;taking one door for another, entered Weazle's chamber, and without any he&s;itation went to bed to his wife, who was fa&s;t a&s;leep; the captain being at another end of the room groping for &s;ome empty ve&s;|&s;el, in lieu of his own chamber-pot, which was leaky: as he did not perceive Strap coming in, he went toward his own bed, after having found a convenience; but no &s;ooner did he feel a rough head covered with a cotton

night-cap, than it came into his mind, that he had mi&s;|taken Mi&s;s Jenny's bed in&s;tead of his own, and that the head he felt was that of &s;ome gallant, with whom &s;he had made an a&s;&s;ignation. Full of this conjecture, and &s;candalized at the pro&s;titution of his apartment, he &s;natch|ed up the ve&s;&s;el he had ju&s;t before filled, and emptied it at once on the a&s;toni&s;hed barber, and his own wife, who, waking at that in&s;tant, broke forth into lamentable cries, which not only alarmed the hu&s;band beyond mea&s;ure, but frightened poor Strap almo&s;t out of his &s;en&s;es; for he verily believed him&s;elf bewitched; e&s;pecially when the in|cen&s;ed captain &s;eized him by the throat, with a volley of oaths, a&s;king him how he dur&s;t have the pre&s;umption to attempt the cha&s;tity of his wife.&mdash;Poor Strap was &s;o amazed and confounded, that he could &s;ay nothing, but&mdash;"I take God to witne&s;s &s;he's a virgin for me."&mdash;Mrs. Weazle, enraged to find her&s;elf in &s;uch a pickle, through the precipitation of her hu&s;band, aro&s;e in her &s;hift, and with the heel of her &s;hoe, which &s;he found by the bed|&s;ide, belaboured the captain's bald pate, till he roared "Murder."&mdash;<Q>I'll teach you to empty your &s;tink-pots on me, (cried &s;he,) you pitiful hop-o'-my-thumb cox|comb.

In the other end, lay the

old u&s;urer &s;prawling on Mi&s;s Jenny's bed, with his flan|nel jacket over his &s;hirt, and his tawny meagre limbs ex|po&s;ed to the air; while &s;he held him fa&s;t by the two ears, and loaded him with execrations. When we a&s;ked what was the matter, &s;he affected to weep, told us, &s;he was afraid that wicked rogue had ruined her in her &s;leep, and bade us take notice of what we &s;aw, for &s;he intended to make u&s;e of our evidence again&s;t him. The poor wretch looked like one more dead than alive, and begged to be relea&s;ed; a favour which he had no &s;ooner obtained, than he prote&s;ted &s;he was no woman, but a devil incarnate&mdash;that &s;he had fir&s;t &s;educed his fle&s;h to rebel, and then be|trayed him.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>NEXT morning, I agreed to give the ma&s;ter of the waggon ten &s;hillings for my pa&s;&s;age to London&punc; provided Strap &s;hould be allowed to take my place, when I &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to walk. At the &s;ame time I de&s;ir|ed him to appea&s;e the inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ed captain, who had entered the kitchen with a drawn &s;word in his hand, and threa|tened with many oaths to &s;acrifice the villain who attempt|ed to violate his bed; but it was to no purpo&s;e for the ma&s;ter to explain the mi&s;take, and a&s;&s;ure him of the poor lad's innocence, who &s;tood trembling behind me all the while: the more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that appeared in Strap, the more implacable &s;eemed the re&s;entment of Weazle, who &s;wore he mu&s;t either fight him or he would in&s;tantly put him to death. I was extremely provoked at this in&s;olence, and told him, it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed that a poor barber lad would engage a man of the &s;word at his own weapon; but I was per&s;uaded he would wre&s;tle or box with him. To which propo&s;al Strap immediately gave a&s;&s;ent, by &s;ay|ing, he would box with him for a guinea.&mdash;Weazle re|plied, with a look of di&s;dain, that it was beneath any gentleman of his character to fight like a porter, or even to put him&s;elf on a footing, in any re&s;pect, with &s;uch a fellow as Strap.&mdash;<Q>Ods boddikins! (cries Joey,) &s;ure cop|tain, yaw would not coomit moorder! Here's a poor lad that's willing to make atonement for his offence; and an that woan't &s;atisfy yaw, offers to fight yaw fairly.&mdash;An yaw woan't box, I dare &s;ay, he will cood|gel with yaw.&mdash;Woan't yaw, my lad?</Q>&mdash;Strap, after &s;ome he&s;itation, an&s;wered, "Ye&mdash;yes, I'll cudgel with him."&mdash;But this expedient being al&s;o rejected by the captain, I began to &s;mell his character, and tipping Strap

the wink, told the company I had always heard it &s;aid, the per&s;on who receives the challenge &s;hould have the choice of the weapons; this therefore being the rule in point of honour, I would venture to promi&s;e on the head of my companion, that he would even fight Captain Wea|zle at &s;harps; but it &s;hould be with &s;uch &s;harps as Strap was be&s;t acquainted with, namely razors.&mdash;At my men|tioning razors, I could perceive the captain's colour change, while Strap, pulling me by the &s;leeve, whi&s;pered with great eagerne&s;s;&mdash;<Q>No, no, not for the love of God don't make any &s;uch bargain.</Q>&mdash;At length Weazle, recovering him&s;elf, turned towards me, and with a fero|cious countenance a&s;ked, <Q>Who the devi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> are you?&mdash;will you fight me?</Q> With the&s;e words, putting him&s;elf in a po&s;ture, I was grievou&s;ly alarmed at &s;eeing the point of a &s;word within half a foot of my brea&s;t; and &s;pringing to one &s;ide, &s;natched up a &s;pit that &s;tood in the chimney-cor|ner, with which I kept my formidable adver&s;ary at bay, who made a great many half longes, &s;kipping backward at every pu&s;h, till at la&s;t I pinned him up in a corner, to the no &s;mall diver&s;ion of the company. While he was in this &s;ituation, his wife entered, and &s;eeing her hu&s;band in the&s;e dangerous circum&s;tances, uttered a dreadful &s;cream.&mdash;In this emergency, Weazle demanded a ce&s;&s;ation, which was immediately granted; and at la&s;t was contented with the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Strap, who, falling on his knees before him, prote&s;ted the innocence of his intention, and a&s;ked par|don for the mi&s;take he had committed. This affair being ended without blood&s;hed, we went to breakfa&s;t, but mi&s;&s;ed two of our company, namely, Mi&s;s Jenny, and the u&s;urer. As for the fir&s;t, Mrs. Weazle informed us, that &s;he had kept her awake all night with her groans; and that when &s;he ro&s;e in the morning, Mi&s;s Jenny was &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed, that &s;he could not proceed on her journey. At that in&s;tant, a me&s;&s;age came from her to the ma&s;ter of the waggon, who immediately went into her chamber, followed by us all. She told him, in a lament|able tone, that &s;he was afraid of a mi&s;carriage, owing to the fright &s;he received la&s;t night, from the brutality of I&s;aac; and as the event was uncertain, de&s;ired the u&s;urer might be detained to an&s;wer for the con&s;equence. Ac|cordingly this ancient Tarquin was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound in the waggon,

whither he had retired to avoid the &s;hame of la&s;t night's di&s;grace, and brought by force into her pre&s;ence. He no &s;ooner appeared, than &s;he began to weep and &s;igh mo&s;t piteou&s;ly, and told us, if &s;he died, &s;he would leave her blood upon the head of that ravi&s;her. Poor I&s;aac turned up his eyes and hands to heaven, prayed that God would deliver him from the machinations of that Jezabel; and, a&s;&s;ured us, with tears in his eyes, that his being found in bed with her, was the re&s;ult of her own invitation.&mdash;The waggoner, under&s;tanding the ca&s;e, advi&s;ed I&s;aac to make it up, by giving her a &s;um of money: to which advice he replied with great vehemence, <Q>A &s;um of money!&mdash;a halter for the cockatrice!</Q>&mdash;<Q>O, 'tis very well (&s;aid Mi&s;s Jenny;) I &s;ee it is in vain to attempt that flinty heart of his, by fair means.&mdash;Joey, be &s;o good as to go to the ju&s;tice, and tell him there is a &s;ick per&s;on here, who wants to &s;ee him on an affair of con&s;e|quence.</Q>&mdash;At the name of ju&s;tice, I&s;aac trembled, and bidding Joey &s;tay, a&s;ked with a quivering voice, "what &s;he would have?" She told him that as he had not perpetrated his wicked purpo&s;e, &s;he would be &s;atisfied with a &s;mall matter. And though the damage &s;he might &s;u&s;tain in her health, might be irreparable, &s;he would give him a relea&s;e for an hundred guineas.&mdash;<Q>An hun|dred guineas! (cried he in an exta&s;y:) an hundred fu|ries!&mdash;Where &s;hould a poor old wretch like me have an hundred guineas? If I had &s;o much money, d'ye think I &s;hould be found travelling in a waggon, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Come, come, (replied Jenny:) none of your mi&s;erly artifice here. You think I don't know I&s;aac Rapine, the money-broker in the Minories.&mdash;Ah! you old rogue! many a pawn have you had of me and my acquaintance which were never redeemed.</Q>&mdash;I&s;aac, finding it was in vain to di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf, offer|ed twenty &s;hillings for a di&s;charge, which &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed under fifty pounds: at la&s;t, however, &s;he was brought down to five, which he paid, with great reluctan|cy, rather than be pro&s;ecuted for a rape. After which accommodation the &s;ick per&s;on made &s;hift to get into the waggon, and we &s;et forwards in great tranquillity, Strap being accommodated with Joey's hor&s;e, the driver him|&s;elf chu&s;ing to walk.&mdash;This morning and forenoon we

were entertained with an account of the valour of cap|tain Weazle, who told us he had once knocked down a &s;oldier that made game of him; tweaked a drawer by the no&s;e, who found fault with his picking his teeth with a fork, at another time; and that he had moreover challen|ged a chee&s;e-monger, who had the pre&s;umption to be his rival: for the truth of which exploits he appealed to his wife.&mdash;She confirmed whatever he &s;aid, and ob&s;erved, <Q>the la&s;t affair happened that very day on which I re|ceived a love-letter from &s;quire Gobble;&mdash;and don't you remember, my dear, I was prodigiou&s;ly &s;ick that very night with eating ortolans, when my Lord Diddle took notice of my complexion's being altered, and my lady was &s;o alarmed, that &s;he had well nigh &s;ainted?</Q>&mdash;<Q>Yes, my dear, (replied the captain,) you know, my lord &s;aid to me, with a &s;neer,&mdash;"Billy, Mrs. Weazle is certainly breeding."&mdash;And I an&s;wered cavalierly&punc; My lord, I wi&s;h I could return the compliment."&mdash;Upon which the company broke out into an immode|rate fit of laughter; and my lord, who loves a repartee dearly, came round and bu&s;&s;ed me.</Q>&mdash;We travelled in this manner five days, without interruption, or meet|ing any thing worth notice: Mi&s;s Jenny (who &s;oon reco|vered her &s;pirits) entertaining us every day with diverting &s;ongs, of which &s;he could &s;ing a great number; and ral|lying her old gallant, who, notwith&s;tanding, would never be reconciled to her.&mdash;On the &s;ixth day, while we were about to &s;it down to dinner, the inn-keeper came and told us, that three gentlemen, ju&s;t arrived, had ordered the victuals to be carried to their apartment, although he had informed them that they were be&s;poke by the pa&s;&s;engers in the waggon. To which information they had replied, <Q>The pa&s;&s;engers in the waggon might be damn'd&mdash;their betters m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t be &s;erved before them&mdash;they &s;uppo&s;ed it would be no hard&s;hip on &s;uch travellers to dine upon bread and chee&s;e for one day.</Q>&mdash;This was a terrible di&s;appointment to us all; and we laid our heads together how to remedy it, when Mi&s;s Jenny ob&s;erved, that Cap|tain Weazle, being by profe&s;&s;ion a &s;oldier, ought in this ca&s;e to protect and prevent us from being re&s;ulted. But the captain excu&s;ed him&s;elf, &s;aying, be would not for all the world be known to have travelled in a waggon; &s;wear|ing,

at the &s;ame time, that could he appear with honour, they &s;hould eat his &s;word &s;ooner than his provi&s;ion&mdash;Upon this declaration, Mi&s;s Jenny &s;natching his weapon, drew it, and ran immediately into the kitchen, where &s;he threat|ened to put the cook to death, if he did not &s;end the vic|tuals into our chamber immediately.&mdash;The noi&s;e &s;he made brought the three &s;trangers down, one of whom no &s;ooner perceived her, than he cried, <Q>Ha!

In the afternoon, I cho&s;e to walk along with Joey, and Strap took my place. Having entered into conver&s;ation with this driver, I &s;oon found him to be a merry, facetious, good-natured fellow, and withal very arch: he informed me that Mi&s;s Jenny was a common girl upon the town, who falling into company with a recruiting officer, he carried her down in the &s;tage-coach from London to New|ca&s;tle, where he had been arre&s;ted for debt, and was now in pri&s;on; upon which &s;he was fain to return to her for|mer way of life, by this conveyance. He told me like|wi&s;e, that one of the gentlemen's &s;ervants, whom we left at the inn, having accidentally &s;een Weazle, immediately knew him, and acquainted Joey with &s;ome particulars of his character. That he had &s;erved my Lord Frizzle in quality of <HI>valet de chambre</HI> many years, while he lived &s;e|parate from his lady: but, upon their reconciliation, &s;he expre&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon Weazle's being turned off, as well as the woman he kept: when his lord&s;hip, to get rid of

both with a good grace, propo&s;ed that he &s;hould marry his mi&s;tre&s;s, and he would procure a commi&s;&s;ion for him in the army. This expedient was agreed to, and Weazle is now, by his lord&s;hip's intere&s;t, en&s;ign in&mdash;'s regiment. I found he and I had the &s;ame &s;entiments with regard to Weazle's courage, which we re&s;olved to put to the trial, by alarming the pa&s;&s;engers with the cry of "an high|wayman!" as &s;oon as an hor&s;eman &s;hould appear. This &s;cheme we put in practice toward the du&s;k, when we de&s;cried a man on hor&s;eback approaching us. Joey had no &s;ooner intimated to the people in the waggon, that he was afraid we &s;hould all be robbed, than a gene|ral con&s;ternation aro&s;e: Strap jumped out of the waggon and hid him&s;elf behind a hedge. The u&s;urer put forth ejaculations, and made a ru&s;tling among the &s;traw, which made us conjecture he had hid &s;omething under it. Mrs. Weazle wringing her hands uttered lamentable cries; and the captain, to our great amazement, began to &s;nore. But this artifice did not &s;ucceed; for Mi&s;s Jenny &s;haking him by the &s;houlders, bawl'd out, <Q>'Sdeath!

(conti|nued he;) at the &s;ame time trembling with &s;uch agita|tion, that the whole carriage &s;hook.&mdash;This &s;ingular piece of behaviour incen&s;ed Mi&s;s Ramper &s;o much, that &s;he cried, <Q>D&mdash;n your pitiful &s;oul, you are as arrant a pol|troon as ever was drummed out of a regiment.&mdash;Stop the waggon, Joey, let me go out, and by G&mdash;d if I have rhetoric enough, the thief &s;hall not only take your pur&s;e, but your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> al&s;o.</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying &s;he leapt out with great agility.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Strap and I are terrified by an apparition&mdash;Strap's con|jecture&mdash;the my&s;tery explained by Joey&mdash;we arrive at London&mdash;our dre&s;s and appearance de&s;cribed&mdash;we are in|&s;ulted in the &s;treet&mdash;an adventure in an ale-hou&s;e&mdash;we are impo&s;ed upon by a waggi&s;h footman&mdash;&s;et to rights by a to|bacconi&s;t&mdash;take lodgings&mdash;dive for a dinner&mdash;an accident at our ordinary.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE arrived at our inn, &s;upped, and went to bed but Strap's di&s;temper continuing, he was obliged to ri&s;e in the middle of the night, and taking the candle in his hand, which he had left burning for the purpo&s;e, he went down to the yard, whence in a &s;hort time he returned in a great hurry, with his hair &s;tanding on end, and a look betokening horror and a&s;toni&s;hment. Without &s;peaking a word, he &s;et down the light, and
<PB N="67" REF="027715_0074_0FD5EBE1E1A8ED98">
jumped into bed behind me, where he lay and trembled with great violence. When I a&s;ked him what was he matter? he replied with a broken accent, <Q>God have mercy on us! I have &s;een the devil.</Q> Though my pre|judice was not quite &s;o &s;trong as his, I was not a little alarmed at this exclamation, and much more &s;o, when I heard the &s;ound of bells approaching our chamber, and felt my bed-fellow cling clo&s;e to me, uttering the&s;e words&mdash;"Chri&s;t have mercy upon us! there he comes." At that in&s;tant a mon&s;trous overgrown raven entered our chamber, with bells at his feet, and made directly towards our bed. As this creature is reckoned in our country a common vehicle for the devil and witches to play their pranks in, I verily believed we were haunted, and in a violent fright &s;hrunk under the bed-clothes. This terrible apparition leapt upon the bed, and, after giving us &s;eve|ral &s;evere dabs with its beak through the blankets, hopped away and vani&s;hed. Strap and I recommended our&s;elves to the protection of Heaven with great devotion, and when we no longer heard the noi&s;e, ventured to peep up and take breath. But we had not been long freed from this phantom, when another appeared that had well nigh deprived us both of our &s;en&s;es. We perceived an old man enter the room, with a long white beard that reached to his middle; there was a certain wild peculiarity in his eyes and countenance, that did not favour of this world; and his dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of a brown &s;tuff coat, buttoned be|hind and at the wri&s;ts, with an old-fa&s;hioned cap of the &s;ame &s;tuff upon his head. I was &s;o amazed that I had not power to move my eyes from &s;uch a gha&s;tly object, but lay motionle&s;s, and &s;aw him come &s;traight up to me. When he reached the bed, he wrung his hands, and cried with a voice, that did not &s;eem to belong to a human creature&punc; "Where is Ralph?" I made no reply; upon which he repeated in an accent &s;till more preternatural, "Where is Ralpho?" He had no &s;ooner pronounced the&s;e words, than I heard the &s;ound of the bells at a di&s;tance, which the apparition having li&s;tened to, tript away, and left me almo&s;t petrified with fear. It was a good while before I could recover my&s;elf &s;o far as to &s;peak; and, when at length I turned to Strap, I &s;ound him in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it, which, how|ever, did not la&s;t long. When he came to him&s;elf, I a&s;ked
<PB N="68" REF="027715_0075_0FD5EBE3A22038A8">
his opinion of what had happened, and he a&s;&s;ured me that the fir&s;t mu&s;t certainly be the &s;oul of &s;ome per&s;on damned, which appeared by the chains about its legs; (for his fears had magnified the creature to the bigne&s;s of a hor&s;e, and the &s;ound of &s;mall morice-bells to the clanking of ma&s;&s;y chains.) As for the old man, he took it to be the &s;pirit of &s;omebody murdered long ago in this place, which had power granted it to torment the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in in the &s;hape of a raven, and that Ralpho was the name of the &s;aid murder|er. Although I had not great faith in this interpretation, I was too much troubled to enjoy any &s;leep, and in all my future adventures never pa&s;&s;ed a night &s;o ill. In the morning Strap imparted the whole affair to Joey, who after an immoderate fit of laughter, explained the matter, by telling him the old man was the landlord's father, who had been an idiot &s;ome years, and diverted him&s;elf with a tame raven, which, it &s;eems, had hopped away from his apartment in the night, and induced him to follow it to our chamber, where he had inquired after it under the name of Ralpho.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of our journey, which continued &s;ix or &s;even days longer: at length we entered the great city, and lodged all night in the inn where the waggon put up. Next morn|ing all the pa&s;&s;engers parted different ways, while my com|panion and I &s;allied out to inquire for the member of par|liament, to whom I had a letter of recommendation from Mr. Crab. As we had di&s;charged our lodgings at the inn, Strap took up our baggage, and marched behind me on the &s;treet with the knap&s;ack on his back as u&s;ual, &s;o that we made a very whim&s;ical appearance. I had dre&s;&s;ed my|&s;elf to the greate&s;t advantage; that is, put on a clean ruffled &s;hirt and my be&s;t thread &s;tockings; my hair (which was of the deepe&s;t red) hung down upon my &s;houlders as lank and &s;traight as a pound of candles, and the &s;kirts of my coat reached to the middle of my leg; my wai&s;tcoat and breeches were of the &s;ame piece, and cut in the &s;ame ta&s;te; and my hat very much re&s;embled a barber's ba&s;on in the &s;hallowne&s;s of the crown, and narrowne&s;s of the brim. Strap was habited in a much le&s;s awkward man|ner; but a &s;hort crop-eared wig that very much re&s;embled Scrub's in the play, and the knap&s;ack on his back, added
<PB N="69" REF="027715_0076_0FD5EBE4DCB28EC0">
to what is called a queer phiz, occa&s;ioned by a long chin, and hook no&s;e, and high cheek bones, rendered him on the whole a very fit &s;ubject of mirth and plea&s;antry. As we walked along, Strap, at my de&s;ire, enquired of a car-man whom we met, whereabouts Mr. Cringer lived&mdash;and was an&s;wered by a &s;tare accompanied with the word, "Anan!" Upon which I came up, in order to explain the que&s;tion, but had the misfortune to be unintelligible likewi&s;e, the car-man damning us for a lou&s;y Scotch guard, and whip|ping up his hor&s;es with a "Gee ho!" which nettled me to the quick, and rou&s;ed the indignation of Strap &s;o far, that, after the fellow was gone a good way, he told me he would fight him for a farthing. While we were deli|berating upon what was to be done, an hackney-coach|man, driving &s;oftly along, and perceiving us &s;tanding by the kennel, came up clo&s;e to us, and calling, "A coach, ma&s;ter!" by a dexterous management of the reins made his hor&s;es &s;tumble in the wet, and bedaub us all over with mud. After which exploit he drove on, applauding him|&s;elf with a hearty laugh, in which &s;everal people joined, to my great mortification; but one more compa&s;&s;ionate than the re&s;t, &s;eeing us &s;trangers, advi&s;ed me to go into an ale-hou&s;e, and dry my&s;elf. I thanked him for his ad|vice, which I immediately complied with; and, going into the hou&s;e he pointed out, called for a pot of beer, and &s;at down by a fire in the public room, where we cleaned our|&s;elves as well as we could. In the mean time a wag, who &s;at in a box &s;moking his pipe, under&s;tanding by our dia|lect that we were from Scotland, came up to me, and, with a grave countenance, a&s;ked how long I had been caught? As I did not know the meaning of his que&s;tion, I made no an&s;wer, and he went on, &s;aying, it could not be a great while, for my tail was not yet cut, at the &s;ame time taking hold of my hair, and tipping the wink to the re&s;t of the company, which &s;eemed highly entertained at his wit. I was greatly incen&s;ed at this u&s;age, but afraid of re&s;enting it, becau&s;e I happened to be in a &s;trange place, and perceived the per&s;on who &s;poke to me was a brawny fellow, for whom I thought my&s;elf by no means a match. However, Strap, having either more courage or le&s;s caution, could not put up with the in&s;ults that I &s;uffered, but told him in a peremptory tone, <Q>He was an
<PB N="70" REF="027715_0077_0FD5EBE62C3BC6B8">
uncivil fellow for making &s;o free with his betters.</Q> Then the wit, going towards him, a&s;ked what he had got in his knap&s;ack: "Is it out meal or brim&s;tone, Sawney?" &s;aid he, &s;eizing him by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nin, which he &s;hook, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible diver&s;ion of all pre&s;ent. My companion, feel|ing him&s;elf a&s;&s;aulted in &s;uch an opprobrious manner, di&s;|engaged him&s;elf in a tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and lent his antagoni&s;t &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ox on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as made him &s;tagger to the other &s;ide of the room; and in a moment a ring was formed for the combatants. Seeing Strap beginning to &s;trip, and my blood being heated with indignation, which bani&s;hed all other thoughts, I undre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the &s;kin in an in|&s;tant, and declared, that, as the affront which occa&s;ioned the quarrel was offered to me, I would fight it out my&s;elf: upon which one or two cried out, <Q>That's a brave Scotch boy; you &s;hall have fair play by G&mdash;d.</Q> This a&s;&s;urance gave me fre&s;h &s;pirits, and going up to my adver&s;ary, who by his pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> countenance did not &s;eem much inclined to the battle, I &s;truck him &s;o hard on the &s;tomach, that he reeled over a bench, and fell to the ground. Then I attempted to keep him down, in order to improve my &s;ucce&s;s, ac|cording to the manner of my own country, but was re|&s;trained by the &s;pectators, one of whom endeavoured to rai&s;e up my opponent, but in vain; for he prote&s;ted he would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, as he was not quite recovered of a late illne&s;s. I was very well plea&s;ed with this excu&s;e, and im|mediately dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, having acquired the good opinion of the company for my bravery, as well as of my comrade Strap, who &s;hook me by the hand, and wi&s;hed me joy of the victory. After having drank our pot, and dried our clothes, we inquired of the landlord if he knew Mr. Crin|ger the member of parliament, and were amazed at his replying in the negative; for we imagined he mu&s;t be al|together as con&s;picuous here as in the borough he repre|&s;ented; but he told us we might po&s;&s;ibly hear of him as we pa&s;&s;ed along. We betook our&s;elves therefore to the &s;treet, where, &s;eeing a footman &s;tanding at a door, we made up to him, and a&s;ked if he knew where out patron lived? This member of the party-coloured fraternity, &s;ur|veying us both very minutely, &s;aid he knew Mr. Cringer very well, and bade us turn down the fir&s;t &s;treet on our left, then turn to the right, and then to the left again,
<PB N="71" REF="027715_0078_0FD5EBEDACC44BF0">
after which perambulation we would ob&s;erve a lane, through which we mu&s;t pa&s;s, and at the other end we &s;hould find an alley that led to another &s;treet, where we &s;hould &s;ee the &s;ign of the Thi&s;tle and three Pedlars, and there he lodged. We thanked him for his information, and went forwards, Strap telling me, that he knew this per&s;on to be an hone&s;t friendly man by his countenance, before he opened his mouth; in which opinion I acdquie&s;|ced, a&s;cribing his good manners to the company he daily &s;aw in the hou&s;e where he &s;erved. We followed his direc|tions punctually, in turning to the left and to the right, and to the left again; but, in&s;tead of &s;eeing a lane before us, found our&s;elves at the &s;ide of the river, a circum&s;tance that perplexed us not a little; and my fellow-traveller ventured to pronounce, that we had certainly mi&s;&s;ed our way. By this time we were pretty much fatigued with our walk, and not knowing how to proceed, I went into a &s;mall &s;nuff-&s;hop hard by, encouraged by the &s;ign of the highlander, where I found, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction the &s;hopkeeper was my countryman. He was no &s;ooner informed of our peregrination, and the directions we had received from the footman, than he informed us we had been impo&s;ed upon, telling us, Mr. Cringer lived at the other end of the town, and that it would be to no pur|po&s;e for us to go thither to-day, for by that time he was gone to the Hou&s;e. I then a&s;ked if he could recommend us to a lodging. He readily gave us a line to one of his acquaintance who kept a chandler's &s;hop not far from St. Martin's Lane; there we hired a bed-room up two pair of &s;tairs, at the rate of 2 <HI>s. per</HI> week, &s;o very &s;mall, that, when the bed was let down, we were obliged to carry out every other piece of furniture that belonged to the apartment, and u&s;e the bed-&s;tead in&s;tead of chairs. About dinner-time our landlord a&s;ked us how we propo&s;ed to live? To which interrogation we an&s;wered, that we would be directed by him. "Well then," &s;ays he, <Q>there are two ways of eating in this town for people of your condi|tion; the one more creditable and expen&s;ive than the other; the fir&s;t is to dine at a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eating-hou&s;e frequented by well-dre&s;&s;ed people only, and the other is called diving, practi&s;ed by tho&s;e who are either obliged or inclined to live frugally.</Q> I gave him to under&s;tand,

that, provided the la&s;t was not infamous, it would &s;uit much better with our circum&s;tances than the other. "In|famous!" cried he; <Q>God forbid; there are many creditable people, rich people, ay, and fine people, that dive every day. I have &s;een many a pretty gentleman, with a laced wai&s;tcoat, dine in that manner very com|fortably for threepence halfpenny, and go afterwards to the coffee-hou&s;e, where he made a figure with the be&s;t lord in the land&mdash;but your own eyes &s;hall bear wit|ne&s;s&mdash;I will go along with you to-day, and introduce you.</Q> He accordingly conducted us to a certain lane, where, &s;topping, he bade us ob&s;erve him, and do as he did; and, walking a few paces, dived into a cellar, and di&s;appeared in an in&s;tant. I followed his example, and, de&s;cending very &s;ucce&s;sfully, found my&s;elf in the middle of a cook's &s;hop, almo&s;t &s;uffocated with the &s;teams of boil|ed beef, and &s;urrounded by a company of hackney-coach|men, chairmen, draymen, and a few footmen out of place or on board-wages, who &s;at eating &s;hin of beef, tripe, cow-heel, or &s;au&s;ages, at &s;eparate boards covered with cloths, which turned my &s;tomach. While I &s;tood in amaze, undetermined whether to &s;it down or walk upwards again, Strap in his de&s;cent, mi&s;&s;ing one of the &s;teps, tumbled headlong into this infernal ordinary, and overturned the cook as &s;he carried a porringer of &s;oup to one of the gue&s;ts: in her fall &s;he da&s;hed the whole me&s;s again&s;t the legs of a drummer belonging to the foot-guards was hap|pened to be in her way, and &s;calded him &s;o mi&s;erably, that he &s;tarted up, and danced up and down, uttering a volley of execrations that made my hair &s;tand on end. While he entertained the company in this manner with an eloquence peculiar to him&s;elf, the cook got up, and after a hearty cur&s;e on the poor author o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> this mi&s;chance, who lay under the table &s;cratching his rump with a woful countenance, emptied a &s;alt-&s;eller in her hand, and &s;trip|ping down the patient's &s;tocking, which brought the &s;kin along with it, applied the contents to the &s;ore.&mdash;This poultice was &s;carce laid on, when the drummer, who began to abate of his exclamation, broke forth into &s;uch a hideous yell, as made the whole company tremble; then &s;eizing a pewter pint-pot that &s;tood by him, &s;queez|ed the &s;ides of it together, as if it had been made of

pliant leather, grinding his teeth at the &s;ame time with a mo&s;t horrible grin. Gue&s;&s;ing the cau&s;e of this violent tran&s;port, I bade the woman wa&s;h off the &s;alt, and bathe the part with oil, which &s;he did, and procured him imme|diate ca&s;e. But here another difficulty occurred, which was no other than the landlady's in&s;i&s;ting on his paying for the pot he had rendered u&s;ele&s;s. He &s;wore he would pay for nothing but what he had eaten, and bade her be thankful for his moderation, or el&s;e he would pro&s;ecute her for da|mages. Strap, fore&s;eeing the whole affair would ly at his door, promi&s;ed to &s;atisfy the cook, and called for a dram of gin to treat the drummer, which entirely appea&s;ed him, and compo&s;ed all animo&s;ities. After this accommodation our landlord and we &s;at down at a board, and dined upon &s;hin of beef mo&s;t deliciou&s;ly, our reckoning amounting to twopence halfpenny each, bread and &s;mall beet included.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>We vi&s;it Strap's friend&mdash;a de&s;cription of him&mdash;his advice&mdash;we go to Mr Cringer's hou&s;e&mdash;are denied admittance&mdash;an accident befals Strap&mdash;his behaviour thereupon&mdash;an extraordinary adventure occurs, in the cour&s;e of which I lo&s;e all my money.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the afternoon my companion propo&s;ed to call at his friend's hou&s;e, which we were informed was in the neighbourhood, whither we accordingly went, and were &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as to find him at home. This gentleman, who had come from Scotland three or four years before, kept a &s;chool in town, where he taught the Latin, French, and Italian languages; but what he chiefly profe&s;&s;ed, was the pronunciation of the Engli&s;h tongue, after a method more &s;peedy and uncommon than any practi&s;ed heretofore; and, indeed, if his &s;cholars &s;poke like their ma&s;ter, the latter part of his undertaking was certainly performed to a tittle; for, although I could ea&s;ily under&s;tand every word of what I heard hitherto &s;ince I entered England, three parts in four of his dialect were as unintelligible to me as if he had &s;poke in Arabic or Iri&s;h. He was a middle-&s;ized man, and &s;tooped very much, though not above the age of forty; his face was frightfully pitted with the &s;mall-pox, and
<PB N="74" REF="027715_0081_0FD5EBF0B0A18620">
his mouth extended from ear to ear. He was dre&s;&s;ed in a night gown of plaid, fa&s;tened about his middle with a &s;erjeant's old &s;a&s;h, and a tie-periwig with a fore-top three inches high, in the fa&s;hion of King Charles the Second's reign. After he had received Strap (who was related to him) very courteou&s;ly, he inquired of him, who I was; and, being informed, took me by the hand, telling me he was at &s;chool with my father. When he under&s;tood my &s;ituation, he a&s;&s;ured me that he would do me all the &s;er|vice in his power, both by his advice and otherwi&s;e; and, while he &s;poke the&s;e words, eyed me with great attention, walking round me &s;everal times, and muttering,&mdash;<Q>O Ch&mdash;&s;t! O Ch&mdash;&s;t! fat a &s;aight is here?</Q> I &s;oon gue&s;&s;ed the rea&s;on of this ejaculation, and &s;aid, <Q>I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, you are not plea&s;ed with my dre&s;s.</Q> "Dre&s;s," an&s;wer|ed he, <Q>you may caal it fat you plea&s;e in your country, but I vaw to Gad, 'tis a ma&s;querade here. No Chri|&s;tian will admit &s;uch a figure into his haw&s;e. Upon my con&s;cience! I wonder the dogs did not hunt you. Did you pa&s;s through St. James's market?&mdash;God ble&s;s my eye-&s;aight! you look like a cou&s;in-german of Ouran|outang.</Q> I began to be a little &s;erious at this di&s;cour&s;e, and a&s;ked him if he thought I &s;hould obtain entrance to|morrow at the hou&s;e of Mr. Cringer, on whom I chiefly depended for an introduction into bu&s;ine&s;s? "Mr. Crin|ger, Mr. Cringer," replied he, &s;cratching his cheek, <Q>may be a very hone&s;t gentleman&mdash;I know nothing to the contrary; but is your &s;ole dependence upon him? Who recommended you to him?</Q> I pulled out Mr. Crab's letter, and told him the foundation of my hopes; at which he &s;tared at me, and repeated, "O Ch&mdash;&s;t!"&mdash;I began to conceive bad omens from this behaviour of his, and begged he would a&s;&s;i&s;t me with his advice, which he promi&s;ed to give very frankly; and, as a &s;pe|cimen, directed us to a periwig ware-hou&s;e in the neigh|bourhood, in order to be accommodated; laying &s;trong injunctions on me not to appear before Mr. Cringer, till I had parted with the&s;e carroty locks, which, he &s;aid, were &s;ufficient to beget an antipathy again&s;t me in all mankind: and, as we were going to pur&s;ue this advice, he called me back, and bade me be &s;ure to deliver my letter into Mr. Cringer's own hand. As we walked along,
<PB N="75" REF="027715_0082_0FD5EBF24723B688">
Strap triumphed greatly in our reception with his friend, who (it &s;eems) had a&s;&s;ured him he would in a day or two provide for him &s;ome good ma&s;ter; "and now," &s;ays he, <Q>you &s;hall &s;ee how I will fit you with a wig. There's ne'er a barber in London (and that's a bold word) can palm a rotten cawl, or a penny-weight of dead hair upon me.</Q> And indeed this zealous adherent did wran|gle &s;o long with the merchant, that he was de&s;ired twenty times to leave the &s;hop, and &s;ee if he could get one cheap|er el&s;ewhere. At length I made choice of a good hand|&s;ome bob, for which I paid ten &s;hillings, and returned to our lodging, where Strap in a moment rid me of that hair which had given the &s;chool-ma&s;ter &s;o much offence.</P>
<P>We got up next day betimes, having been informed that Mr. Cringer gave audience by candle-light to all his dependents, he him&s;elf being obliged to attend the lev&eacute;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of my Lord Terrier at break of day, becau&s;e his lord&s;hip made one at the mini&s;ter's between eight and nine o'clock. When we came to Mr. Cringer's door, Strap, to give me an in&s;tance of his politene&s;s, ran to the knocker, which he employed &s;o loud and &s;o long, that he alarmed the whole &s;treet; and, a window opening in the &s;econd &s;tory of the next hou&s;e, a chamber-pot was di&s;charged upon him &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that the poor barber was wet to the &s;kin, while I, being luckily at &s;ome di&s;tance, e&s;caped the un&s;avoury deluge. In the mean time a footman, opening the door, and &s;eeing nobody in the &s;treet but us, a&s;ked with a &s;tern countenance, if it was I who made &s;uch a damned noi&s;e, and what I wanted? I told him I had bu|&s;ine&s;s with his ma&s;ter, whom I de&s;ired to &s;ee. Upon which he clapped the door in my face, telling me, I mu&s;t learn better manners before I could have acce&s;s to his ma&s;ter. Vexed at this di&s;appointment, I turned my re|&s;entment again&s;t Strap, whom I &s;harply reprimanded for his pre&s;umption: but he, not in the lea&s;t regarding what I &s;aid, wrung the urine out of his periwig, and, lifting up a large &s;tone, flung it with &s;uch force again&s;t the &s;treet-door of that hou&s;e from whence he had been bedew|ed, that, the lock giving way, it flew wide open, and he took to his heels, leaving me to follow him as I could. Indeed there was no time for deliberation; I therefore pur&s;ued him with all the &s;peed I could exert, until we
<PB N="76" REF="027715_0083_0FD5EBF62F6168E8">
found our&s;elves, about the dawn, in a &s;treet we did not know. Here as we wandered along, gaping about, a very decent &s;ort of a man, pa&s;&s;ing by me, &s;topped of a &s;udden, and took up &s;omething, which having examined, he turned and pre&s;ented it to me with the&s;e words: <Q>Sir, you have dropt half a crown.</Q> I was not a little &s;urpri|&s;ed at this in&s;tance of hone&s;ty, and told him it did not belong to me; but he bade me recollect, and &s;ee if all my money was &s;afe: upon which I pulled out my pur&s;e, (for I had bought one &s;ince I came to town,) and reckoning my money in my hand, which was now reduced to five guineas, &s;even &s;hillings, and twopence, a&s;&s;ured him I had lo&s;t nothing. "Well then," &s;ays he, <Q>&s;o much the better&mdash;This is God&s;end&mdash;and as you two were pre&s;ent when I picked it up, you are entitled to equal &s;hares with me.</Q> I was a&s;toni&s;hed at the&s;e words, and looked upon this per&s;on to be a prodigy of integrity, but ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed to take any part of the &s;um. <Q>Come, gen|tlemen,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>you are too mode&s;t&mdash;I &s;ee you are &s;trangers&mdash;but you &s;hall give me leave to treat you with a wet this cold raw morning.</Q> I would have declined this invitation, but Strap whi&s;pered to me, that the gen|tleman would be affronted; and I complied. <Q>Where &s;hall we go?</Q> &s;aid the &s;tranger; <Q>I am quite ignorant of this part of the town.</Q> I informed him that we were in the &s;ame &s;ituation; upon which he propo&s;ed to go into the fir&s;t public-hou&s;e we &s;hould find open; and, as we walked together, he began in this manner: <Q>I find by your tongues you are from Scotland, gentlemen. My grandmother by the father's &s;ide was of your country, and I am &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in its favour, that I never meet a Scotchman but my heart warms. The Scots are a very brave people. There is &s;carce a great family in the kingdom that cannot boa&s;t of &s;ome exploits per|formed by its ance&s;tors many hundred years ago. There's your Dougla&s;&s;es, Gordons, Campbells, Hamil|tons. We have no &s;uch ancient families here in Eng|land. Then you are all very well educated. I have known a pedlar talk in Greek and Hebrew as well as if they had been his mother tongue&mdash;And for hone&s;ty&mdash;I once had a &s;ervant, his name was Gregor M'Gregor. I would have tru&s;ted him with untold gold.</Q> This
<PB N="77" REF="027715_0084_0FD5EBF8E8353E50">
eulogium on my native country gained my affection &s;o &s;trongly, that I believe I could have gone to death to &s;erve the author, and Strap's eyes &s;wam in tears. At length, as we pa&s;&s;ed through a dark narrow lane, we perceived a public-hou&s;e, which we entered, and found a man &s;itting by the fire, &s;moking a pipe, with a pint of purl before him. Our new acquaintance a&s;ked us if ever we had drank egg-flip? to which que&s;tion we an&s;wering in the negative, he a&s;&s;ured us of a regale, and ordered a quart to be pre|pared, calling for pipes and tobacco at the &s;ame time. We found this compo&s;ition very palatable, and drank heartily, the conver&s;ation (which was introduced by the gentleman) turning upon the &s;nares that young unexperi|enced people are expo&s;ed to in this metropolis. He de|&s;cribed a thou&s;and cheats that are daily practi&s;ed upon the ignorant and unwary, and warned us of them with &s;o much good-nature and concern, that we ble&s;&s;ed the opportunity which threw us in his way. After we had put the cann about for &s;ome time, our new friend began to yawn, telling us he had been up all night with a &s;ick per&s;on, and pro|po&s;ed we &s;hould have recour&s;e to &s;ome diver&s;ion to keep him awake. "Suppo&s;e," &s;aid he, <Q>we &s;hould take a hand at whi&s;t for pa&s;time. But let me &s;ee, that won't do, there's only three of us, and I cannot play at any other game. The truth is, I &s;eldom or never play but out of complai&s;ance, or at &s;uch a time as this, when I am in danger of falling a&s;leep.</Q> Although I was not much inclined to gaming, I felt no aver&s;ion to pa&s;s an hour or two at cards with a friend, and, knowing that Strap under&s;tood as much of the matter as I, made no &s;cruple of &s;aying, "I wi&s;h we could find a fourth hand." While we were in this perplexity, the per&s;on whom we &s;ound in the hou&s;e at our entrance, over-hearing our di&s;cour&s;e, took the pipe from his mouth very gravely, and acco&s;ted us thus: "Gentlemen, my pipe is out you &s;ee," &s;haking the a&s;hes into the fire, <Q>and rather than you &s;hould be baulk|ed, I don't care if I take a hand with you for a trifle&mdash;but remember I won't play for any thing of con&s;e|quence.</Q> We accepted his offer with plea&s;ure; and, having cut for partners, it fell to my lot to play with him, again&s;t our friend and Strap, for threepence a game. We were &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that in a &s;hort time I was half a crown
<PB N="78" REF="027715_0085_0FD5EBFB0E38F5F0">
gainer, when the gentleman whom we had met in the &s;treet, ob&s;erving he had no luck to-day, propo&s;ed to leave off, or change partners. By this time I was inflamed with my good fortune, and the expectation of improving it, as I perceived the two &s;trangers played but indifferently: therefore I voted for giving him his revenge; and, cutting again, Strap and I (to our mutual &s;atisfaction) happened to be partners. My good fortune attended me &s;till, and in le&s;s than an hour we had got thirty &s;hillings of their money; for, as they lo&s;t, they grew the keener, and doubled &s;takes every time. At la&s;t the incon&s;tant godde&s;s began to veer about, and we were very &s;oon &s;tript of all our gains, and about forty &s;hillings of our own money. This lo&s;s mortified me extremely, and had a vi&s;ible effect on the mu&s;cles of Strap's face, which lengthened apace; but our antagoni&s;ts, perceiving our condition, kindly per|mitted us to retrieve our lo&s;s, and con&s;ole our&s;elves with a new acqui&s;ition. Then my companion wi&s;ely &s;ugge&s;ted it was time to be gone; upon which the per&s;on who had joined us in the hou&s;e, began to cur&s;e the cards, and mut|tered, that we were indebted to fortune only for what we had got, no part of our &s;ucce&s;s being owing to our good play. This in&s;inuation nettled me &s;o much, that I chal|lenged him to a game of piquet for a crown; and he was with difficulty per&s;uaded to accept the invitation. This conte&s;t ended in le&s;s than an hour, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible af|fliction, who lo&s;t every &s;hilling of my own money, Strap ab&s;olutely refu&s;ing to &s;upply me with a &s;ixpence. The gen|tleman, at who&s;e reque&s;t we had come in, perceiving by my di&s;con&s;olate looks the &s;ituation of my heart, which well nigh bur&s;ted with grief and re&s;entment, when the other &s;tranger got up, and went away with my money, began in this manner: <Q>I am truly afflicted at your bad luck, and would willingly repair it&punc; was it in my power. But what, in the name of goodne&s;s, could provoke you to tempt your fate &s;o long? It is always a maxim with game&s;ters to pur&s;ue &s;ucce&s;s as far as it will go, and to &s;top whenever fortune &s;hifts about. You are a young man, and your pa&s;&s;ions too impetuous; you mu&s;t learn to govern them better: however, there is no experience like that which is bought; you will be the better for this the longe&s;t day you have to live.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Strap moralizes&mdash;pre&s;ents his pur&s;e to me&mdash;we inform our landlord of my misfortune; he unravels the my&s;tery&mdash;I pre&s;ent my&s;elf to Cringer&mdash;he recommends and turns me over to Mr. Staytape&mdash;I become acquainted with a fellow|dependent, who explains the characters of Cringer and Staytape&mdash;and informs me of the method to be pur&s;ued at the Navy-office and Surgeons-hall&mdash;Strap is employed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN our way to our lodging, after a profound &s;ilence on both &s;ides, Strap, with a hideous groan, ob&s;erved, that we had brought our pigs to a fine market. To this ob&s;ervation I made no reply, and he went on: <Q>God &s;end us well out of this place, we have not been in London eight and forty hours, and I believe we have met with eight and forty thou&s;and misfortunes. We have been jeered, reproached, buffetted, pi&s;&s;ed upon, and at la&s;t &s;tript of our money; and I &s;uppo&s;e by and by we &s;hall be &s;tript of our &s;kins. Indeed, as to the money part of it, that was owing to our own folly; Solomon &s;ays, <HI>Bray a fool in a mortar, and he will ne|ver be wi&s;e.</HI> Ah! God help us, an ounce of prudence is worth a pound of gold.</Q> This was no time for him to tamper with my di&s;po&s;ition, already mad with my lo&s;s,
<PB N="80" REF="027715_0087_0FD5EBFD76A7E5C8">
and inflamed with re&s;entment again&s;t him, for having re|fu&s;ed me a little money to attempt to retrieve it. I there|fore turned towards him with a &s;tern countenance, and a&s;ked, "Whom he called a fool?" Being altogether unac|cu&s;tomed to &s;uch looks from me, he &s;tood &s;till and &s;tared in my face for &s;ome time; then, with &s;ome confu&s;ion, ut|tered, <Q>Fool! I called nobody fool but my&s;elf; I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I am the greate&s;t fool of the two, for being &s;o much concerned at other people's misfortunes;&mdash;but <HI>Nemo omnibus horis &s;apit</HI>&mdash;that's all&mdash;that's all.</Q> Upon which a &s;ilence en&s;ued that brought us to our lodging where I threw my&s;elf upon the bed in an agony of de|&s;pair, re&s;olved to peri&s;h, rather than apply to my compa|nion or any other body for relief; but Strap, who knew my temper, and who&s;e heart bled within him at my di&s;|tre&s;s, after &s;ome pau&s;e, came to the bed-&s;ide, and put|ting a leathern pur&s;e into my hand, bur&s;t into tears, cry|ing, <Q>I know what you think: but I &s;corn your thoughts. There's all I have in the world, take it, and I'll perhaps get more for you before that be done, if not, I'll beg for you, &s;teal for you, go through the wide world with you, and &s;tarve with you; for though I be a poor cobler's &s;on, I am no &s;cout.</Q> I was &s;o touched with the generous pa&s;&s;ion of this poor creature, that I could not refrain from weeping al&s;o, and we ming|led our tears together for &s;ome time. Upon examining the pur&s;e, I found in it two half guineas and half-a-crown, which I would have returned to him, &s;aying, he knew better than I how to manage it; but he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed my propo&s;al, and told me, it was more rea&s;onable and decent that he &s;hould depend upon me, who was a gentle|man, than that I &s;hould be controuled by him.</P>
<P>After this friendly conte&s;t was over, and our minds more at ea&s;e, we informed our landlord of what had hap|pened to us, taking care to conceal the extremity to which we were reduced. He no &s;ooner heard the &s;tory, than he a&s;&s;ured us we had been grievou&s;ly impo&s;ed upon by a couple of &s;harpers, who were a&s;&s;ociates; and that this polite, hone&s;t, friendly, humane per&s;on, who had treated us &s;o civilly, was no other than a ra&s;cally money-dropper, who made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to decoy &s;trangers in that man|ner, to one of his own haunts, where an accomplice or
<PB N="81" REF="027715_0088_0FD5EC0241E8B560">
two were always waiting to a&s;&s;i&s;t in pillaging the prey he had run down. Here the good man recounted a great many &s;tories of people who had been &s;educed, cheated, pilfered, beat,&mdash;nay, even murdered by &s;uch villains. I was confounded at the artifice and wickedne&s;s of mankind, and Strap lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, prayed that God would deliver him from &s;uch &s;cenes of iniquity; for &s;urely the devil had &s;et up his throne in London.&mdash;Our landlord being curious to know what reception we had met with at Mr. Cringer's, we acquainted him with the particulars, at which he &s;hook his head, and told us, we had not gone the right way to work; that there was nothing to be done with a m&mdash;b&mdash;r of p&mdash;m&mdash;t with|out a bribe; that the &s;ervant was commonly infected with the ma&s;ter's di&s;ea&s;e, and expected to be paid for his work, as well as his betters.&mdash;He therefore advi&s;ed me to give the footman a &s;hilling the next time I &s;hould de&s;ire admittance to my patron, or el&s;e I &s;hould &s;carce find an opportunity to deliver my letter. Accordingly, next morn|ing, when the door was opened, I &s;lipt a &s;hilling into his hand, and told him I had a letter for his ma&s;ter.&mdash;I found the good effects of my liberality; for the fellow let me in immediately, and taking the letter out of my hand, de|&s;ired me to wait, in a kind of pa&s;&s;age, for an an&s;wer. In this place I continued &s;tanding three quarters of an hour, during which time I &s;aw a great many young fellows, whom I formerly knew in Scotland, pa&s;s and repa&s;s, with an air of familiarity, in their way to and from the audi|ence chamber; while I was fain to &s;tand &s;hivering in the cold, and turn my back to them, that they might not perceive the lowne&s;s of my condition.&mdash;At length, Mr. Cringer came out to &s;ee a young gentleman to the door, who was no other than Squire Gawky, dre&s;&s;ed in a very gay &s;uit of clothes: at parting Mr. Cringer &s;hook him by the hand, and told him he hoped to have the plea&s;ure of his company at dinner. Then turning about towards me, he a&s;ked what were my commands: when he under&s;tood I was the per&s;on who had brought the letter from Mr. Crab, he affected to recollect my name, which, however, he pretended he could not do, till he had con&s;ulted the letter again; to &s;ave him that trouble, I told him my name was Random.&mdash;Upon which he went on, <Q>Ay, ay

<P>At my return, I was &s;urpri&s;ed with the agreeable news of Strap's being employed on the recommendation of his friend the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, by a periwig-maker in the neighbourhood, who allowed him five &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> week, be&s;ides bed and board.&mdash;I continued to dance attendance every other morning at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Mr. Cringer, during a fortnight, in which time I became acquainted with a young fellow of my own country and profe&s;&s;ion, who al&s;o depend|ed on the member's intere&s;t; but was treated with much more re&s;pect than I both by the &s;ervants and ma&s;ter, and often admitted into a parlour, where there was a fire, for the convenience of the better &s;ort of tho&s;e who waited for him.&mdash;Thither I was never permitted to penetrate, on ac|count of my appearance, which was not at all fa&s;hionable: but was obliged to &s;tand blowing my fingers in a cold lobby, and take the fir&s;t opportunity of Mr. Cringer's going to the door, to &s;peak with him.&mdash;One day, while I enjoyed this occa&s;ion, a per&s;on was introduced, whom, Mr. Cringer no &s;ooner &s;aw, than running towards him, he &s;aluted with a bow to the very ground, and after|wards &s;haking him by the hand with great heartine&s;s and familiarity, called him his good friend, and a&s;ked very kindly after Mrs. Staytape, and the young ladies; then after a whi&s;per which continued &s;ome minutes, wherein I

overheard the word <HI>honour</HI> repeated &s;everal times with great empha&s;is, Mr. Cringer introduced me to this gen|tleman as to a per&s;on who&s;e advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance I might depend upon, and having given me his direction, follow|ed me to the door, where he told me, I need not give my&s;elf the trouble to call at his hou&s;e any more&punc; for Mr. Staytape would do my bu&s;ine&s;s. At that in&s;tant my fel|low dependant coming out after me overheard the di&s;cour&s;e of Mr. Cringer, and making up to me in the &s;treet, ac|co&s;ted me very civilly. This addre&s;s I looked upon as no &s;mall honour, con&s;idering the figure he made; for he was dre&s;&s;ed in a blue frock with a gold button, a green &s;ilk wai&s;tcoat trimmed with gold, black velvet breeches, white &s;ilk &s;tockings, &s;ilver buckles, a gold laced hat, a &s;pencer wig, and a &s;ilver-hilted hanger, with a fine clouded cane in his hand.&mdash;"I perceive," &s;ays he, <Q>you are but late|ly come from Scotland?&mdash;pray what may your bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. Cringer be?&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e it is no &s;ecret&mdash;and I may po&s;&s;ibly give you &s;ome advice that will be &s;er|viceable; for I have been &s;urgeon's &s;econd mate, on board of a &s;eventy gun &s;hip, and con&s;equently know a good deal of the world.</Q>&mdash;I made no &s;cruple to di&s;clo&s;e my &s;ituation, which, when he had learned, he &s;hook his head, and told me he had been pretty much in the &s;ame circum&s;tance about a year ago; that he had relied on Cringer's promi&s;es, until his money (which was con&s;ider|able) as well as his credit, was quite exhau&s;ted; and when he wrote to his relations for a fre&s;h &s;upply, in&s;tead of mo|ney, he received nothing but reproaches, and the epithets of idle, debauched fellow: that after he had waited at the navy-office many months for a warrant to no purpo&s;e, he was fain to pawn &s;ome of his clothes, which rai&s;ed a &s;mall &s;um, wherewith he bribed the &s;&mdash;t&mdash;y, who &s;oon procured a warrant for him, notwith&s;tanding he had af|firmed the &s;ame day, that there was not one vacancy.&mdash;That he had gone on board, where he remained nine months; at the end of which the &s;hip was put out of com|mi&s;&s;ion: and, he &s;aid, the company were to be paid off in Broad-&s;treet the very next day.&mdash;That his relations being reconciled to him, had charged him to pay his de|voirs regularly to Mr. Cringer, who had informed them by letter, that his intere&s;t alone had procured the war|rant;

in obedience to which command, he came to his lev&eacute;e every morning, as I &s;aw, though he looked upon him to be a very pitiful &s;coundrel. In conclu&s;ion, he a&s;ked me, if I had yet pa&s;&s;ed at &s;urgeon's hall? To which que&s;tion, I an&s;wered, I did not &s;o much as know it was nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;"Nece&s;&s;ary," cried he, <Q>O Lord! O Lord!

While we &s;at in this place, he told me I mu&s;t fir&s;t go to the navy-office, and write to the board, de&s;iring them to order a letter for me to the &s;urgeon's-hall, that I might be examined touching my &s;kill in &s;ur|gery: That the &s;urgeons, after having examined me, would give me my qualification &s;ealed up in form of a letter, directed to the commi&s;&s;ioners; which qualification&punc; I mu&s;t deliver to the &s;ecretary of the board, who would open it in my pre&s;ence, and read the contents.

would defer his going thither till to-morrow, when I &s;hould go along with him, and he would put me in a way of acting for my&s;elf, without a &s;ervile dependence on that ra&s;cal Cringer, much le&s;s on the lou&s;y taylor to whom he heard him turn me over.&mdash;"How," cried I, <Q>is Mr. Staytape a taylor?</Q>&mdash;"No le&s;s, I'll a&s;&s;ure you," an|&s;wered he, <Q>and, I confe&s;s, more likely to &s;erve you than the member: for provided you can entertain him with politics and conundrums, you may have credit with him for as many and as rich clothes as you plea&s;e.</Q>&mdash;I told him I was utterly ignorant of both, and &s;o incens'd at Cringer's u&s;age, that I would never &s;et a foot within his door again.&mdash;After a good deal more conver&s;ation, my new acquaintance and I parted, having made an appoint|ment to meet next day at the &s;ame place, in order to &s;et out for the city.&mdash;I went immediately to Strap, and re|lated every thing which had happened, but he did not at all approve of my being &s;o forward to lend money to a &s;tranger, e&s;pecially as we had been already &s;o much im|po&s;ed upon by appearances.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the morning I ro&s;e and went to the place of rendez|vous, where I waited two hours in vain; and was &s;o exa&s;perated again&s;t him for breaking his appointment, that I &s;et out for the city by my&s;elf, in hope of finding the villain, and being revenged on him for his breach of promi&s;e.&mdash;At length I found my&s;elf at the navy-office, which I entered, and &s;aw crowds of young fellows walking below: many of whom made no better appearance than
<PB N="86" REF="027715_0093_0FD5EC0D55D8F4E0">
my&s;elf.&mdash;I con&s;ulted the phy&s;iognomy of each, and at la&s;t made up to one who&s;e countenance I liked; and a&s;ked, if he could in&s;truct me in the form of the letter which was to be &s;ent to the board, to obtain an order for examination: he an&s;wered me in broad Scotch, that he would &s;hew me the copy of what he had written for him&s;elf, by the direc|tion of another who knew the form: and accordingly pulled it out of his pocket for my peru&s;al; and told me, that if I was expeditious, I might &s;end it in to the board before dinner, for they did no bu&s;ine&s;s in the afternoon. He then went with me to a coffee-hou&s;e hard by, where I&punc; wrote the letter, which was immediately delivered to the me&s;&s;enger; who told me, I might expect an order to-morrow about the &s;ame time.&mdash;Having tran&s;acted this piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, my mind was a good deal compo&s;ed: and as I had met with &s;o much civility from this &s;tranger, I de&s;ired further acquaintance with him, fully re&s;olved, however, not to be deceived by him &s;o much to my preju|dice advice as I had been by the beau&mdash;He agreed to dine with me at a cook's &s;hop which I frequented; and on our way thither, carried me to 'Change, where I was in &s;ome hopes of finding Mr. Jack&s;on, (for that was the name of the per&s;on who had broke his appointment.) I &s;ought there for him to no purpo&s;e, and on our way towards the other end of the town, imparted to my companion his behaviour towards me: upon which, he gave me to under&s;tand, that he was no &s;tranger to the name of beau Jack&s;on, (&s;o he was called at the navy-office,) although he did not know him per&s;onally; that he had the character of a good-na|tured carele&s;s fellow, who made no &s;cruple of borrowing from any body that would lend; that mo&s;t people who knew him believed he had a good principle at bottom, but his extravagance was &s;uch, he would probably never have it in his power to manife&s;t the hone&s;ty of his intention. This account made me &s;weat for my five &s;hillings, which I neverthele&s;s did not altogether de&s;pair of recovering, provided I could find out the debtor. This young man likewi&s;e added another circum&s;tance of Squire Jack&s;on's hi&s;tory, which was, that, being de&s;titute of all means to equip him&s;elf for &s;ea when he received his la&s;t warrant, he had been recommended to a per&s;on, who lent him a little money, after he had &s;igned a will and power, entitling
<PB N="87" REF="027715_0094_0FD5EC0E0E44F828">
that per&s;on to lift his wages when they &s;hould become due, as al&s;o to inherit his effects in ca&s;e of his death&mdash;that he was &s;till under the tutorage and directions of that gen|tleman, who advanced him &s;mall &s;ums from time to time upon this &s;ecurity, at the rate of 50 <HI>per cent.</HI> But at pre|&s;ent his credit was very low, becau&s;e his funds would do little more than pay what he had already received, this moderate intere&s;t included. After the &s;tranger (who&s;e name was Thom&s;on) had entertained me with this account of Jack&s;on, he informed me that he him&s;elf had pa&s;&s;ed for a third mate of a third rate about four months ago, &s;ince which time he had con&s;tantly attended at the navy-office in hope of a warrant, having been a&s;&s;ured from the begin|ning, both by a Scotch member and one of the commi&s;|&s;ioners to whom the member recommended him, that he &s;hould be put into the fir&s;t vacancy; notwith&s;tanding which promi&s;e, he had the mortification to &s;ee &s;ix or &s;e|ven appointed in the &s;ame &s;tation almo&s;t every week&mdash;that now being utterly impoveri&s;hed, his &s;ole hope con&s;i&s;ted in the promi&s;e of a friend lately come to town, to lend him a &s;mall matter, for a pre&s;ent to the &s;&mdash;t&mdash;y; without which he was per&s;uaded he might wait a thou&s;and years to no purpo&s;e.&mdash;I conceived a mighty liking for this young fellow, which, I believe, proceeded from the &s;imi|litude of our fortunes. We &s;pent the whole day together; and as he lived at Wapping, I de&s;ired him to take a &s;hare of my bed.&mdash;Next day we returned to the navy-office, where, after being called before the board, and que|&s;tioned about the place of my nativity and education, they ordered a letter to be made out for me, which, after pay|ing half a crown to the clerk, I received, and delivered into the hands of the clerk at &s;urgeons-hall, together with a &s;hilling for his trouble in regi&s;tering my name.&mdash;By this time my whole &s;tock was dimini&s;hed to two &s;hil|lings, and I &s;aw not the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of relief, even for pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, much le&s;s to enable me to pay the fees at &s;urgeons-hall, for my examination, which would come on in a fortnight.&mdash;In this &s;tate of perplexity, I con&s;ult|ed Strap, who a&s;&s;ured me, he would pawn every thing he had in the world, even to his razors, before I &s;hould want: but this expedient I ab&s;olutely rejected, telling him, I would a thou&s;and times rather li&s;t for a &s;oldier, of
<PB N="88" REF="027715_0095_0FD5EC0F67210760">
which I had &s;ome thoughts, than be any longer a bur|den to him.&mdash;At the word &s;oldier, he grew pale as death, and begged on his knees, I would think no more of that &s;cheme. "God pre&s;erve us all in our right wits!" cried he, <Q>would you turn &s;oldier, and perhaps be &s;ent abroad again&s;t the Spaniards, where you mu&s;t &s;tand and be &s;hot at like a woodcock?&mdash;Heaven keep cold lead out of my carca&s;e! and let me die in a bed like a Chri&s;tian, as all my forefathers have done? What &s;ig|nifies all the riches and honours of this life, if one en|joys not content!&mdash;And in the next there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons: better be a poor hone&s;t barber with a good con&s;cience, and time to repent of my &s;ins upon my death-bed, than be cut off (God ble&s;s us) by a mu&s;|ket &s;hot, as it were in the very flower of one's age, in the pur&s;uit of riches and fame.&mdash;What &s;ignify riches, (my dear friend?) do they not make unto them&s;elves wings, as the wi&s;e man &s;aith? and does not Horace ob|&s;erve, <HI>Non domus aut fundus, non oeris acerous aut auri aegroto domino deduxit corpore febrem, &punc;non animo curas?</HI>&mdash;I could moreover mention many other &s;ayings in con|tempt of riches, both from the Bible and other good books; but as I know you are not very fond of tho&s;e things, I &s;hall only a&s;&s;ure you, that if you take on to be a &s;oldier, I will do the &s;ame; and then, if we &s;hould both be &s;lain, you will not only have your own blood to an&s;wer for, but mine al&s;o: and peradventure the lives of all tho&s;e whom we &s;hall kill in battle.&mdash;There|fore I pray you, con&s;ider whether you will &s;it down contented with &s;mall things, and &s;hare the fruits of my indu&s;try in peace, till providence &s;hall &s;end better tid|ings; or by your de&s;pair, plunge both our &s;ouls and bodies into everla&s;ting perdition, which God of his in|finite mercy forbid.</Q>&mdash;I could not help &s;miling at this harangue, which he delivered with great earne&s;tne&s;s, the tears &s;tanding in his eyes all the time; and promi&s;ed to do nothing of that &s;ort without his con&s;ent and concur|rence.&mdash;He was much comforted with this declaration; and told me, in a few days he &s;hould receive a week's wages, which &s;hould be at my &s;ervice, but advi&s;ed me, in the mean time, to go in que&s;t of Jack&s;on, and recover, if po&s;&s;ible, what he had borrowed of me.&mdash;I accordingly

trudged about from one end of the town to the other, for &s;everal days, without being able to learn any thing cer|tain concerning him. However, being one day extremely hungry, and allured by the &s;teams that regaled my no|&s;trils from a boiling cellar, I went down with an inten|tion to gratify my appetite with two-penny worth of beef; when, to my no &s;mall &s;urpri&s;e, I found Mr. Jack&s;on &s;it|ting at dinner with a footman. He no &s;ooner perceived me than he got up, and &s;hook me by the hand, &s;aying, <Q>He was glad to &s;ee me, for he intended to call at my lodgings in the afternoon.</Q>&mdash;I was &s;o well plea&s;ed with this rencounter, and the apologies he made for not keeping his appointment, that I forgot my re&s;ent|ment, and &s;at down to dinner, with the happy expecta|tion of not only recovering my own money before we &s;hould part, but al&s;o of reaping the benefit of his pro|mi&s;e to lend me wherewithal to pa&s;s examination; and this hope my &s;anguine complection &s;ugge&s;ted, though the account Thom&s;on gave me of him ought to have mode|rated my expectation.&mdash;When we had fea&s;ted &s;umptuou&s;ly, he took his leave of the footman, and adjourned with me to an ale hou&s;e hard by, where, after &s;haking me by the hand again, he began thus: <Q>I &s;uppo&s;e you think me a &s;ad dog, Mr. Random, and I do confe&s;s that ap|pearances are again&s;t me.&mdash;But I dare &s;ay you will for|give me when I tell you, my not coming at the time appointed, was owing to a peremptory me&s;&s;age I re|ceived from a certain lady, whom&mdash;harkee (but this is a great &s;ecret) I am to marry very &s;oon.&mdash;You think this &s;trange perhaps, but it is not le&s;s true for all that&mdash;a five thou&s;and pounder, I'll a&s;&s;ure you, be&s;ides ex|pectations.&mdash;For my own part, devil take me if I know what any woman can &s;ee engaging about me&mdash;but a whim, you know&mdash;and then one would not baulk one's good fortune.&mdash;You &s;aw that footman who din'd with us&mdash;He is one of the hone&s;te&s;t fellows that ever wore livery&mdash;You mu&s;t know it was by his means I was in|troduced to her, for he made me fir&s;t acquainted with her woman, who is his mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;ay, many a crown has he and his &s;weetheart had of my money&mdash;but what of that! things are now brought to a bearing.&mdash;I have&mdash;(come a little this way) I have propos'd marriage, and

<P>I go to &s;urgeons-hall, where I meet with Mr. Jack&s;on&mdash;am examined&mdash;a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ierce di&s;pute ari&s;es between two of the examiners&mdash;Jack&s;on di&s;gui&s;es him&s;elf to attract re&s;pect&mdash;is detected&mdash;in hazard of being &s;ent to Bridewell&mdash;he treats us at a tavern&mdash;carries us to a night hou&s;e, a trouble&s;ome adventure there&mdash;we are committed to the Roundhou&s;e&mdash;carried before a ju&s;tice&mdash;his behaviour.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WITH the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this faithful adherent, who gave me almo&s;t all the money he earned, I pre&s;er|ved my half-guinea entire till the day of examination, when I went with a quaking heart to &s;urgeons-hall, in order to undergo that ceremony. Among a crowd of young fellows, who walked in the outward hall, I perceiv|ed Mr. Jack&s;on, to whom I immediately went up, and, inquiring into the &s;tate of his amour, under&s;tood it was &s;till undetermined by rea&s;on of his friend's ab&s;ence, and the delay of the recal at Chatham, which put it out of his power to bring it to a conclu&s;ion. I then a&s;ked what his bu&s;ine&s;s was in this place? he replied, he was re&s;olved to have two &s;trings to his bow, that, in ca&s;e the one failed, he might u&s;e the other, and, with this view, he was to pa&s;s that night for a higher qualification. At that in&s;tant a young fellow came out from the place of examination with a pale countenance, his lip quivering, and his looks as wild as if he had &s;een a gho&s;t. He no &s;ooner appeared, than we all flocked about him with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s to know what reception he had met with, which (after &s;ome pau&s;e) he de&s;cribed, recounting all the que&s;tions they had a&s;ked, with the an&s;wers he made. In this manner we obliged no le&s;s than twelve to recapitulate, which, now the danger was pa&s;t, they did with plea&s;ure, before it fell to my lot. At length the beadle called my name with a voice that made me tremble as much as if it had been the
<PB N="95" REF="027715_0102_0FD5CDE9EBFD98C0">
&s;ound of the la&s;t trumpet: however, there was no remedy; I was conducted into a large hall, where I &s;aw about a dozen of grim faces &s;itting at a long table, one of whom bade me come forward in &s;uch an imperious tone, that I was actually for a minute or two bereft of my &s;en&s;es. The fir&s;t que&s;tion he put to me was, "Where was you born?" To which I an&s;wered, "In Scotland." "In Scotland," &s;aid he; <Q>I know that very well&mdash;we have &s;carce any other countrymen to examine here&mdash;you Scotchmen have over&s;pread us of late as the locu&s;ts did Egypt. I a&s;k you in what part of Scotland you was born?</Q> I named the place of my nativity, which he had never before heard of: he then proceeded to interrogate me about my age, the town where I &s;erved my time, with the term of my apprentice&s;hip; and, when I informed him that I &s;erved three years only, he fell into a violent pa&s;&s;ion; &s;wore it was a &s;hame and a &s;candal to &s;end &s;uch raw boys into the world as &s;urgeons; that it was great pre&s;umption in me, and an affront upon the Engli&s;h, to pretend to &s;ufficient &s;kill in my bu&s;ine&s;s, having &s;erved &s;o &s;hort a time, when every apprentice in England was bound &s;even years at lea&s;t; that my friends would have done better if they had made me a weaver or a &s;hoemaker, but their pride would have me a gentleman (he &s;uppo&s;ed) at any rate, and their poverty could not afford the nece&s;&s;ary education. This exordium did not at all contribute to the recovery of my &s;pirits, but, on the contrary, reduced me to &s;uch a &s;itua|tion, that I was &s;carce able to &s;tand; which being percei|ved by a plump gentleman, who &s;at oppo&s;ite to me with a &s;kull before him, he &s;aid, Mr. Snarler was too &s;evere upon the young man; and, turning towards me, told me I need not be afraid, for nobody would do me any harm; then, bidding me take time to recollect my&s;elf, he exa|mined me touching the operation of the trepan, and was very well &s;atisfied with my an&s;wers. The next per&s;on who que&s;tioned me was a wag, who began by a&s;king if I had ever &s;een an amputation performed? and, I replying in the affirmative, he &s;hook his head, and &s;aid, <Q>What! upon a dead &s;ubject, I &s;uppo&s;e? If,</Q> continued he, <Q>during an engagement at &s;ea, a man &s;hould be brought to you with his head &s;hot off, how would you behave?</Q> After &s;ome he&s;itation I owned, &s;uch a ca&s;e had never come un|der

my ob&s;ervation, neither did I remember to have &s;een any method of cure propo&s;ed, for &s;uch an accident, in any of the &s;y&s;tems of &s;urgery I had peru&s;ed. Whether it was owing to the &s;implicity of my an&s;wer, or the archne&s;s of the que&s;tion, I know not, but every member at the board deigned a &s;mile except Mr. Snarler, who &s;eemed to have very little of the <HI>animal ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ile</HI> in his con&s;titution. The facetious member, encouraged by the &s;ucce&s;s of his la&s;t joke, went on thus: <Q>Suppo&s;e you was called to a patient of a plethoric habit, who had been brui&s;ed by a fall, what would you do?</Q> I an&s;wered, I would bleed him immediately. "What," &s;aid he, <Q>before you had tied up his arm?</Q> But, this &s;troke of wit not an&s;wering his expectation, he de&s;ired me to advance to the gentleman who &s;at next him, and who, with a pert air, a&s;ked what method of cure I would follow in wounds of the inte&s;tines? I repeated the method of cure as it is pre&s;cribed by the be&s;t chirurgical writers; which he heard to an end, and then &s;aid with a &s;upercilious &s;mile, <Q>So you think with &s;uch treatment the patient might recover?</Q> I told him I &s;aw nothing to make me think otherwi&s;e. <Q>That may be,</Q> re&s;umed he; <Q>I won't an&s;wer for your fore&s;ight; but did you ever know a ca&s;e of this kind &s;ucceed?</Q> I acknowledged I did not, and was about to tell him I had never &s;een a wounded inte&s;tine; but he &s;topped me by &s;aying with &s;ome precipitation, <Q>Nor never will. I affirm, that all wounds of the inte&s;tines, whether great or &s;mall, are mortal.</Q> "Pardon me, brother," &s;ays the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at gentleman, "there is very good authority."&mdash;Here he was interrupted by the other with <Q>Sir, excu&s;e me, I de&s;pi&s;e all authority.&mdash;<HI>Nullius in verba</HI>&mdash;I &s;tand upon my own bottom.</Q> "But, Sir, Sir," replied his an|tagoni&s;t, "the rea&s;on of the thing &s;hews"&mdash;<Q>A fig for rea&s;on,</Q> cried this &s;ufficient member; <Q>I laugh at rea|&s;on; give me ocular demon&s;tration.</Q> The corpulent gentleman began to wax warm, and ob&s;erved, that no man, acquainted with the anatomy of the part, would ad|vance &s;uch an extravagant a&s;&s;ertion. This <HI>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">endo</HI> enraged the other &s;o much, that he &s;tarted up, and in a furious tone exclaimed&mdash;<Q>What, Sir! do you que&s;tion my know|ledge in anatomy?</Q> By this time all the examiners had e&s;pou&s;ed the opinion of one or other of the&s;e di&s;putants,
<PB N="97" REF="027715_0104_0FD5EC1B6FA99578">
and rai&s;ed their voices all together, when the chairman commanded &s;ilence, and ordered me to withdraw. In le&s;s than a quarter of an hour I was called in again, received my qualification &s;ealed up, and was ordered to pay 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. I laid down my half-guinea upon the table, and &s;tood &s;ome time, until one of them bade me begone. To this I replied, "I will, when I have got my change;" upon which another threw me five &s;hillings and &s;ixpence, &s;aying, I &s;hould not be a true Scotchman if I went away without my change. I was afterwards obliged to give three &s;hil|lings and &s;ixpence to the beadles, and a &s;hilling to an old woman who &s;wept the hall: this di&s;bur&s;ement &s;unk my finances to thirteen pence halfpenny, with which I was &s;neaking off, when Jack&s;on, perceiving it, came up to me, and begged I would tarry for him, and he would accom|pany me to the other end of the town as &s;oon as his exa|mination was over. I could not refu&s;e this to a per&s;on that was &s;o much my friend; but I was a&s;toni&s;hed at the change of his dre&s;s, which was varied in half an hour, from what I have already de&s;cribed, to a very grote&s;que fa&s;hion. His head was covered with an old &s;moked tie-wig that did not boa&s;t one crooked hair, and a &s;louched hat over it, which would have very well became a chimney-&s;weeper, or a du&s;t-man; his neck was adorned with a black crape, the ends of which he had twi&s;ted, and fixed in the button-hole of a &s;habby great coat that wrapped up his whole body; his white &s;ilk &s;tockings were converted into black wor&s;ted ho&s;e; and his countenance was rendered venerable by wrinkles, and a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ard of his own painting. When I ex|pre&s;&s;ed my &s;urprize at this metamorpho&s;is, he laughed, and told me it was done by the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a friend who lived over the way, and would certainly produce &s;omething very much to his advantage: for it gave him the appearance of age, which never fails of attracting re|&s;pect. I applauded his &s;agacity, and waited with impa|tience for the effects of it. At length he was called in: but whether the oddne&s;s of his appearance excited a curio|&s;ity more than u&s;ual in the board, or his behaviour was not &s;uitable to his figure, I know not; but he was di&s;covered to be an impo&s;tor, and put into the hands of the beadle, in order to be &s;ent to Bridewell: &s;o that in&s;tead of &s;eeing him come out with a cheerful countenance, and a &s;urgeon's

qualification in his hand, I perceived him led through the outward hall as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and was very much alarmed and anxious to know the occa&s;ion, when he called with a lamentable voice, and piteous a&s;pect to me, and &s;ome others who kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w him, <Q>For God's &s;ake, gentlemen, bear wit|ne&s;s, that I am the &s;ame individual John Jack&s;on who &s;erved as &s;urgeon's mate aboard the Elizabeth, or el&s;e I &s;hall go to Bridewell.</Q> It would have been impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t au&s;tere hermit, that ever lived, to have refrain|ed from laughing at his appearance and addre&s;s; we there|fore indulged our&s;elves a good while at his expence, and afterwards pleaded his cau&s;e &s;o effectually with the beadle, who was gratified with half a crown, that the pri&s;oner was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and in a few minutes re&s;umed his former gaiety, &s;wearing, &s;ince the board had refu&s;ed his money, he would &s;pend it every &s;hilling, before he went to bed, in treat|ing his friends, at the &s;ame time inviting us all to favour him with our company. It was now ten o'clock at night; and as I had a great way to walk through &s;treets that were utterly unknown to me, I was prevailed upon to be of their party, in hopes he would afterwards accompany me to my lodgings, according to his promi&s;e. He conducted us to his friend's hou&s;e, who kept a tavern over the way, where we continued drinking punch, until the liquor mounted up to our heads, and made us all extremely fro|lick&s;ome; I in particular was &s;o much elevated, that no|thing would &s;erve me but a wench, at which demand Jack|&s;on expre&s;&s;ed much joy, and a&s;&s;ured me I &s;hould have my de&s;ire before we parted. Accordingly, when he had paid the reckoning, we &s;allied out roar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ng and &s;inging, and were conducted by our leader to a place of nocturnal en|tertainment, where I immediately attached my&s;elf to a fair one, with whom I propo&s;ed to &s;pend the remaining part of the night; but &s;he, not reli&s;hing my appearance, refu&s;ed to grant my reque&s;t before I &s;hould have made her an acknowledgment, which, not &s;uiting with my circum|&s;tances, we broke off our corre&s;pondence, to my no &s;mall mortification and re&s;entment, becau&s;e I thought the merce|nary creature had not done ju&s;tice to my merit. In the mean time Mr. Jack&s;on's dre&s;s had attracted the inclina|tions and a&s;&s;iduities of two or three nymphs, who loaded him with care&s;&s;es in return for the arrack punch with which
<PB N="99" REF="027715_0106_0FD5EC1E5D668128">
he treated them; till, at length, notwith&s;tanding the &s;prightly &s;allies of tho&s;e charmers, &s;leep began to exert his power over us all, and our conductor called, "To pay." When the bill was brought, it amounted to twelve &s;hillings: he put his hand in his pocket, but might have &s;aved him|&s;elf the trouble: for his pur&s;e was gone. This accident di&s;concerted him a good deal at fir&s;t; but, after &s;ome re|collection, he &s;eized the two Dul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ineas who &s;at by him, one in each hand, and &s;wore, if they did not immediately re&s;tore his money, he would charge a con&s;table with them.

Jack&s;on told her he was robbed, and &s;wore, if &s;he refu&s;ed him &s;atisfa|ction, he would have her and her whores committed to Bridewell.

I have known this woman a great while; &s;he has kept a notorious hou&s;e in the neighbourhood the&s;e many years, and, although often complained of as a nui&s;ance, &s;till e&s;capes through her intere&s;t with the j&mdash;t&mdash;ces, to whom &s;he and all of her employment pay contribution quarterly for protection. As &s;he charged me with you fir&s;t, her complaint will have the preference, and &s;he can procure evidence to &s;wear whatever &s;he &s;hall plea&s;e to de&s;ire of them; &s;o that, unle&s;s you make it up before morning, you and your companions may think your|&s;elves happily quit for a month's hard labour in Bride|well. Nay, if &s;he &s;hould &s;wear a robbery or a&s;&s;ault again&s;t you, you will be committed to Newgate, and tried next &s;e&s;&s;ions at the Old Bailey for your life.</Q> This la&s;t piece of information had &s;uch an effect upon Jack&s;on, that he agreed to make it up, provided his money might he re&s;tored. The con&s;table told him, that in&s;tead of re|trieving what he had lo&s;t, he was pretty certain it would co&s;t him &s;ome more before they would come to any com|po&s;ition. But, however, he had compa&s;&s;ion on him, and would, if he plea&s;ed, &s;ound them about a mutual relea&s;e. The unfortunate beau thanked him for his friend&s;hip, and, returning to us, acquainted us with the &s;ub&s;tance of this dialogue; while the con&s;table, de&s;iring to &s;peak in private with our adver&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, carried her into the next room, and pleaded our cau&s;e &s;o effectually, that &s;he conde&s;cended to make him umpire: he accordingly propo&s;ed an arbitration, to which we gave our a&s;&s;ent; and he fined each party in three &s;hillings, to be laid out in a bowl of punch, wherein we drowned all animo&s;ities, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of my two late acquaintances and me, who had been in the &s;tate of the damned ever &s;ince Jack&s;on mentioned Bridewell and Newgate. By this time we had fini&s;hed our bowl, to which, by the by, I had contributed my la&s;t &s;hilling, it was morn|ing; and I propo&s;ed to move homeward, when the con|&s;table gave me to under&s;tand, he could di&s;charge no pri|&s;oners but by order of the ju&s;tice, before whom we mu&s;t appear. This renewed my chagrin, and I cur&s;ed the hour in which I had yielded to Jack&s;on's invitation. About nine o'clock we were e&s;corted to the hou&s;e of a certain ju&s;tice not many miles di&s;tant from Covent-garden, who no &s;ooner &s;aw the con&s;table enter with a train of pri&s;oners at his

To this declaration he replied, <Q>How! you impudent ra&s;cal, dare you &s;ay &s;o to my face? Do you think I am to be impo&s;ed upon by that northern accent which you have a&s;&s;umed? but it &s;han't avail you&mdash;you &s;hall find me too far north for you.&mdash;Here, clerk, write this fellow's <HI>mittimus.</HI>&mdash;His name is Patrick Gaghagan.</Q> Here Mr. Jack&s;on inter|po&s;ed, and told him I was a Scotchman lately come to town, de&s;cended of a good family, and that my name was Random. The ju&s;tice looked upon this a&s;&s;ertion as an out|rage upon his memory, on which he valued him&s;elf much; and, &s;trutting up to Jack&s;on with a fierce countenance, put his hands on his &s;ides, and &s;aid, <Q>Who are you, Sir? Do you give me the lie? Take notice, gentlemen, here's a fellow who affronts me upon the bench: but I'll lay you fa&s;t, &s;irrah, I will&mdash;for, notwith&s;tanding your laced jacket, I believe you are a notorious felon.</Q> My friend was &s;o much aba&s;hed at this menace, which was thundered out with great vociferation, that he changed colour, and remained &s;peechle&s;s.

his wor&s;hip, acquainted him with the truth of the &s;tory; which having learned, he returned with a &s;miling counte|nance, and, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to us all, &s;aid, it was al|ways his way to terrify young people when they came be|fore him, that his threats might make a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on their minds, and deter them from engaging in &s;cenes of riot and debauchery, which commonly ended before the judge. Thus, having cloaked his own want of di&s;cern|ment under the di&s;gui&s;e of paternal care, we were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and I found my&s;elf as much lightened as if a mountain had been li&s;ted off my brea&s;t.</P>

While he was employed in this office, he addre&s;&s;ed me thus: <Q>To be &s;ure, Mr. Ran|dom, you are born a gentleman, and have a great deal of learning&mdash;and indeed look like a gentleman, for as to per&s;on you may hold up your head with the be&s;t of them.&mdash;On the other hand, I am a poor, but hone&s;t cobler's &s;on&mdash;my mother was as indu&s;trious a woman as ever broke bread, till &s;uch time as &s;he took to drink|ing, which you very well know&mdash;but every body has failings&mdash;<HI>humanum e&s;t errare.</HI>&mdash;Now for my&s;elf, I am a poor journeyman barber, tolerably well made, and under&s;tand &s;ome Latin, and have a &s;mattering of Greek&mdash;but what of that? perhaps I might al&s;o &s;ay that I know a little of the world&mdash;but that is to no purpo&s;e&mdash;though you be gentle and I &s;imple, it does not fol|low but that I who am &s;imple may do a good office to

<P>NEXT day, while I was at work in the &s;hop, a boun|cing dam&s;el well dre&s;&s;ed came in on pretence of finding a vial for &s;ome u&s;e or other, and taking an oppor|tunity, when &s;he thought I did not mind her, of ob&s;erving me narrowly, went away with a &s;ilent look of di&s;dain. I ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed her &s;entiments, and my pride took the re&s;o|lution of entertaining the &s;ame indifference and neglect towards her. At dinner the maids, with whom I dined in the kitchen, gave me a under&s;tand, that this was my ma&s;ter's only daughter, who would have a very hand&s;ome fortune, on account of which, and her beauty, a great many young gentlemen made their addre&s;&s;es to her&mdash;that &s;he had been twice on the brink of marriage, but di&s;ap|pointed by the &s;tingine&s;s of her father, who refu&s;ed to part with a &s;hilling to promote the match; for which rea&s;on the young lady did not behave to her father with all the filial

veneration that might be expected; in particular, &s;he har|boured the mo&s;t perfect hatred for his countrymen, in which di&s;po&s;ition &s;he re&s;embled her mother, who was an Engli&s;h woman; and, by the&s;e hints they dropped, I learn|ed the grey mare was the better hor&s;e&mdash;that &s;he was a ma|tron of a high &s;pirit, which was often manife&s;ted at the expence of her dependants; that &s;he loved diver&s;ions, and looked upon Mi&s;s as her rival in all parties, which was in|deed the true cau&s;e of her di&s;appointments; for, had the mother been hearty in her intere&s;t, the father would not have ventured to refu&s;e her demands.&mdash;Over and above this intelligence, I of my&s;elf &s;oon made more di&s;coveries; Mr. Lavement's &s;ignificant grins at his wife, while &s;he looked another way, convinced me that he was not at all content with his lot; and his behaviour in pre&s;ence of the captain, made me believe his chief torment was jealou&s;y.&mdash;As for my own part, I was con&s;idered in no other light than that of a menial &s;ervant, and had been already &s;ix days in the hou&s;e without being honoured with one word from either mother or daughter, the latter, (as I under|&s;tood from the maids) having at table one day expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urprize that her papa &s;hould entertain &s;uch an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k|ward mean looking journeyman.&mdash;I was nettled at this piece of information, and next Sunday (it being my turn to take my diver&s;ion) dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in my new clothes to the greate&s;t advantage, and, vanity apart, made no contemptible figure.&mdash;After having &s;pent mo&s;t part of the day in company with Strap and &s;ome of his acquaintance, I came home in the afternoon, and was let in by Mi&s;s, who not knowing me, dropt a low courte&s;y as I advan|ced, which I returned with a profound bow, and &s;hut the door. By that time I had turned about, &s;he had per|ceived her mi&s;take, and changed colour, but did not withdraw. The pa&s;&s;age being narrow, I could not get away without jo&s;tling her; &s;o I was forced to remain where I was, with my eyes fixed on the ground, and my face glowing with blu&s;hes.&mdash;At length her vanity coming to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he went away tittering, and I could hear her pronounce the word, "creature." From this day forward, &s;he came into the &s;hop fifty times every day, upon various pretences, and put in practice &s;o many ridi|culous airs, that I could ea&s;ily perceive her opinion of me

But my heart was &s;o &s;teeled again&s;t her charms, by pride and re&s;entment, which were two chief ingredients in my di&s;po&s;ition, that I remained in&s;en|&s;ible to all her arts; and, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome advances &s;he made, could not be prevailed upon to yield her the lea&s;t attention.&mdash;This neglect &s;oon bani&s;hed all the fa|vourable impre&s;&s;ions &s;he felt for me, and the rage of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lighted woman took place in her heart: this &s;he mani|fe&s;ted not only in all the &s;ugge&s;tions her malice could in|vent to my prejudice with her father, but al&s;o in procur|ing for me &s;uch &s;ervile employmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as &s;he hoped would &s;ufficiently humble my &s;pirit.

mol|lify, and &s;ealed his reconciliation with a ki&s;s.&mdash;This cir|cum&s;tance &s;oon convinced me of the occa&s;ion of the quar|rel; but notwith&s;tanding all my vigilance, I could never di&s;cover any other commerce between them.&mdash;In the mean while, I had rea&s;on to believe I had in&s;pired one of the maids with tender &s;entiments for me; and one night when I thought every other per&s;on in the hou&s;e a&s;leep, I took the opportunity of going to reap the fruits of my con|que&s;t; her bedfellow having the day before gone to Rich|mond to vi&s;it her parents. Accordingly I got up, and (naked as I was) explored my way in the dark, to the garret where &s;he lay.&mdash;I was ravi&s;hed to find the door open, and moved &s;oftly to her bed &s;ide, tran&s;ported with the hope of completing my wi&s;hes.&mdash;But what horrors of jealou&s;y and di&s;appointment did I feel, when I found her a&s;leep, fa&s;t locked in the arms of a man, whom I ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed to be no other than the captain's &s;ervant. I was upon the point of doing &s;ome ra&s;h thing, when the noi&s;e of a rat &s;cratching behind the wain&s;cot, put me to flight, and I was fain to get back to my own bed in &s;afety. Whether this alarm had di&s;ordered my mind, or that I was led a&s;tray by the power of de&s;tiny, I know not; but in&s;tead of turning to the left hand, when I de&s;cended to the &s;econd &s;tory, I pur&s;ued the contrary cour&s;e, and mi&s;|took the young lady's bedchamber for my own. I did not perceive my mi&s;take before I had run again&s;t the bed po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ts; and then it was not in my power to retreat undi&s;|covered; for the nymph being awake, felt my approach, and with a &s;oft voice, bade me make le&s;s noi&s;e le&s;t the Scotch booby in the next room &s;hould over-hear us. This hint was &s;ufficient to inform me of the nature of the a&s;&s;ig|nation; and as my pa&s;&s;ions, at any time high, were then in a &s;tate of exaltation, I was re&s;olved to profit by my good fortune.&mdash;Without any more ceremony, therefore, I made bold to &s;lip into bed to this charmer, who gave me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> favourable a reception as I could de&s;ire. Our conver|&s;ation was very &s;paring on my part, but &s;he upbraided the per&s;on whom I repre&s;ented, with his jealou&s;y of me, whom &s;he handled &s;o roughly, that my re&s;entment had well nigh occa&s;ioned a di&s;covery more than once; but I was con&s;oled for her hatred of me, by the revenge I en|joyed in under&s;tanding from her own mouth, that it was

now high time to &s;ave her reputation by matrimony; for &s;he had rea&s;on to fear &s;he could not much longer conceal the effects of their mutual intercour&s;e. While I was me|ditating an an&s;wer to this propo&s;al, I heard a noi&s;e in my room, like &s;omething heavy falling down upon the floor: upon which I &s;tarted up, and creeping to the door of my chamber, ob&s;erved by moon light, the &s;hadow of a man groping his way out; &s;o I retired to one &s;ide to let him pa&s;s, and &s;aw him go down &s;tairs as expeditiou&s;ly as he could. It was an ea&s;y matter to divine that this was the captain, who having over&s;lept him&s;elf, had got up at la&s;t to keep his a&s;&s;ignation; and finding my door open, had entered my apartment in&s;tead of that of his mi&s;tre&s;s, where I &s;upplied his place. But finding his mi&s;take, by falling over my chair, he was afraid the noi&s;e might alarm the family, and for that rea&s;on made off, delaying the grati|fication of his de&s;ire till another opportunity. By this time I was &s;atisfied and in&s;tead of returning to the place from whence I came, retreated to my own ca&s;tle, which I fortified by bolting the door, and, in the congratulation of my own happine&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell a&s;leep.&mdash;But the truth of this adventure could not be long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from my young mi&s;tre&s;s, who next day came to an explanation with the captain, upon his lamenting his la&s;t night's di&s;appoint|ment, and begging pardon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the noi&s;e he had made. Their mutual the grin, when they came to the knowledge of what had happened, may be ea&s;ily conjectured, though each had a peculiar grief unfelt by the other, for &s;he was con&s;cious of not only having betrayed to me the &s;ecrets of her commerce with him, but al&s;o of having incen&s;ed me by the freedoms &s;he had taken with my name, beyond a hope of reconciliation.&mdash;On the other hand, his jealou|&s;y &s;ugge&s;ted, that her &s;orrow was all artifice; and that I had &s;upplied his place with her own privity and con&s;ent.&mdash;That &s;uch was the &s;ituation of their thoughts, will ap|pear in the &s;equel; for that very day &s;he came into the &s;hop, where I was alone, and fixing her eyes, Swimming in tears upon me, &s;ighed mo&s;t piteou&s;ly; but I was proof again&s;t her di&s;tre&s;s, by recollecting the epithets with which &s;he had honoured me the night before; and believ|ing that the good reception I enjoyed was de&s;tined for another, therefore took no notice of her affliction; and

&s;he had the mortification to find her di&s;dain returned four|fold.&mdash;However, from thenceforward &s;he thought proper to u&s;e me with more complai&s;ance than u&s;ual, knowing that it was in my power at any time to publi&s;h her &s;hame. By the&s;e means my life became much more agreeable, (though I never could prevail upon my&s;elf to repeat my nocturnal vi&s;it;) and as I every day improved in my know|ledge of the town, I &s;hook off my aukward air by de|grees, and acquired the character of a polite journeyman apothecary.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ONE night about twelve o'clock, as I returned from vi&s;iting a patient at Chel&s;ea, I received a blow on my head from an un&s;een hand that &s;tretched me &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the ground, and was left for dead with three &s;tabs of a &s;word in my body. The groans I uttered, when I re|covered the u&s;e of my rea&s;on, alarmed the people of a &s;o|litary ale-hou&s;e that &s;tood near the &s;pot where I lay, and they were humane enough to take me in, and &s;end for a &s;urgeon, who dre&s;&s;ed my wounds and a&s;&s;ured me they were not mortal. One of them penetrated through the &s;kin and mu&s;cles of one &s;ide of my belly in &s;uch a manner, that doubtle&s;s the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in imagined he had run me through the entrails: the &s;econd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">launted along one of my ribs; and the la&s;t, which was intended for the fini&s;hing &s;troke, having been directed to my heart, the &s;word &s;napped upon my brea&s;t-bone, and the point remained &s;ticking in the &s;kin. When I reflected upon this event, I could not per&s;uade <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;elf that I had been a&s;&s;aulted by a common foot-pad, becau&s;e it is not u&s;ual for &s;uch people to murder tho&s;e they rob, e&s;pecially when they meet with no re&s;i&s;tance; and I found my money and every thing el&s;e about me (but my carca&s;e) &s;afe. I concluded, therefore, that I mu&s;t either have been mi&s;taken for another, or obliged to the private
<PB N="116" REF="027715_0123_0FD5EC4F20A0D438">
re&s;entment of &s;ome &s;ecret enemy for what had happened&mdash;and, as I could remember nobody, who had the lea&s;t cau&s;e of complaint again&s;t me, except Captain Odonnell and my ma&s;ter's daughter, my &s;u&s;picion &s;ettled upon them, though I took care to conceal it, that I might the &s;ooner arrive at confirmation. With this view I went home in a chair about ten o'clock in the morning, and, as the chairman &s;upported me into the hou&s;e, met the captain in the pa&s;|&s;age, who no &s;ooner &s;aw me than he &s;tarted back, and gave evident &s;igns of guilty confu&s;ion, which he would have accounted for from the &s;urpri&s;e occa&s;ioned by &s;eeing me in &s;uch a condition. My ma&s;ter, having heard my &s;tory, condoled me with a good deal of &s;ympathy, and, when he under&s;tood my wounds were not dangerous, order|ed me to be carried up &s;tairs to bed, though not without &s;ome oppo&s;ition from his wife, who was of opinion it would be better for me to go to an ho&s;pital, where I &s;hould be more carefully attended. My meditation was employed in concerting with my&s;elf &s;ome method of revenge again&s;t Squire Odonnell and his inamorata, whom looked upon as the authors of my misfortune, when Mi&s;s (who was not at home at my arrival) entered my chamber, and, &s;aying &s;he was &s;orry for the accident that had befallen me, a&s;ked if I &s;u&s;pected any body to be the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in? Upon which I fixed my eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly upon her, and an&s;wered, "Yes." She di&s;covered no &s;ymptom of confu&s;ion, but replied ha|&s;tily, <Q>If that be the ca&s;e, why don't you take out a warrant to have him apprehended? it will co&s;t but a trifle&mdash;if you have no money, I'll lend you.</Q> This frankne&s;s not only cured me of my &s;u&s;picion with re&s;pect to her, but even &s;taggered my belief with regard to the captain, of who&s;e guilt I re&s;olved to have farther proof, before I &s;hould enterprize any thing in the way of re|venge. I thanked her kindly for her generous offer; which, however, I had no occa&s;ion to accept, being determined to do nothing ra&s;hly; for, though I could plainly perceive the per&s;on who attacked me to be a &s;oldier, who&s;e face I thought was familiar to me, I could not &s;wear, with a &s;afe con&s;cience, to any particular man, and, granting I could, my pro&s;ecution of him would not much avail. This un|certainty I pretended, left the captain, hearing from her that I knew the per&s;on who wounded me, might think
<PB N="117" REF="027715_0124_0FD5EC514F0B7C78">
proper to withdraw, before I could be in a condition to requite him. In two days I was up, and able to do a little bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o that Mr. Lavement made &s;hift to carry on his practice, without hiring another journeyman in my room. The fir&s;t thing I attempted towards a certain di&s;covery of my &s;ecret enemy, was to get into Odonnell's apartment while he was abroad in an undre&s;s, and examine his &s;word, the point of which being broke off, I applied the frag|ment that was found &s;ticking in my body, and found it an&s;wered the fractured part exactly. There was no room le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t for doubt, and all that remained was to fix upon a &s;cheme of revenge, which almo&s;t &s;olely engro&s;&s;ed my thoughts during the &s;pace of eight nights and days. Sometimes I was tempted to fall upon him in the &s;ame manner as he had practi&s;ed upon me, and kill him out|right. But this a&s;&s;ault my honour oppo&s;ed as a piece of barbarous cowardice, in which he was not to be imitated. At other times I entertained thoughts of demanding &s;atis|faction in an honourable way, but was diverted from this undertaking by con&s;idering the uncertainty of the event, and the nature of the injury he had done me, which did not intitle him to &s;uch ea&s;y terms. At la&s;t I determined to pur&s;ue a middle cour&s;e, and actually put my de&s;ign in execution after this manner&mdash;Having &s;ecured the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Strap, and two of his acquaintance whom he could de|pend upon, we provided our&s;elves with di&s;gui&s;es, and I cau&s;ed the following letter to be delivered to him by one of our a&s;&s;ociates in livery one Sunday evening:</P>

<P>IF I may be allowed to judge from appearance, it will not be di&s;agreeable to you to hear that my hu&s;band is gone to Bag&s;hot to vi&s;it a patient, and will not re|turn till to-morrow night: &s;o that if you have any thing to propo&s;e to me, (as your behaviour on many occa&s;ions has &s;eemed to in&s;inuate,) you will do well to embrace the pre&s;ent opportunity of &s;eeing</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This letter was &s;igned with the name of an apothecary's wife who lived in Chel&s;ea, of whom I had heard Odonnell was an admirer. Every thing &s;ucceeded to our wi&s;h. The
<PB N="118" REF="027715_0125_0FD5EC52F2355520">
amorous hero ha&s;tened towards the place of a&s;&s;ignation, and was encountered by us in the very place where he had a&s;&s;aulted me. We ru&s;hed upon him all at once, &s;ecured his &s;word, &s;tripped off his clothes even to his &s;kin, which we &s;courged with nettles till he was bli&s;tered from head to foot, notwith&s;tanding all the eloquence of his tears and &s;upplications. When I was &s;atisfied with the &s;tripes I had be&s;towed, we carried off his clothes which we hid in a hedge near the place, and left him &s;tark-naked, to find his way home in the be&s;t manner he could, while I took care to be there before him. I afterwards under&s;tood that, in his way to the lodgings of a friend who lived in the &s;kirts of the town, he was picked up by the watch, who carried him to the Round-hou&s;e, from whence he &s;ent for clothes to his lodgings, and next morning arrived at the door in a chair, wrapped up in a blanket he had borrowed; for his body was &s;o &s;ore and &s;welled, that he could not bear to be confined in his wearing apparel. He was treated with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s by my mi&s;tre&s;s and her daugh|ter, who vied with each other in their care and attendance of him; but Lavement him&s;elf could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orbear expre&s;&s;ing his joy by &s;everal malicious grins while he ordered me to prepare an unguent for his &s;ores. As to my&s;elf, nobody can doubt my gratification, when I had every day an opportunity of &s;eeing my revenge protracted on the body of my adver&s;ary, by the ulcers of which I had been the cau&s;e; and indeed I not only enjoyed the &s;atisfaction of having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ead him alive, but another al&s;o which I had not fore&s;een. The &s;tory of his being attacked and &s;tripped in &s;uch a place, having been in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erted in the news, gave in|formation to tho&s;e who found his clothes next day, whi|ther to bring them; and accordingly he retrieved every thing he had lo&s;t except a few letters, among which was that which I had writ to him in the name of the apothe|cary's wife. This and the others, which (it &s;eems) were all on the &s;ubject of love, (for this Hibernian hero was one of tho&s;e people who are called fortune-hunters,) fell into the hands of a certain female author, famous for the &s;candal &s;he has publi&s;hed, who, after having embelli&s;hed them with &s;ome ornaments of her own invention, gave them to the town in print. I was very much &s;hocked o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> reflecting, that I might po&s;&s;ibly be the occa&s;ion of a whole
<PB N="119" REF="027715_0126_0FD5EC56823FED80">
family's unhappine&s;s on account of the letter I had written, but was ea&s;ed of that apprehen&s;ion, when I under&s;tood, that the Chel&s;ea apothecary had commenced a law-&s;uit again&s;t the printer for defamation, and looked upon the whole as a piece of forgery committed by the author, who had di&s;appeared. But, whatever might be his opinion of the matter, our two ladies &s;eemed to entertain a different idea of it; for, as &s;oon as the pamphlet appeared, I could perceive their care of their patient con&s;iderably dimini&s;h, until at la&s;t it ended in total neglect. It was impo&s;&s;ible for him to be ignorant of this change any more than of the occa&s;ion of it; but, as he was con&s;cious to him&s;elf of having de&s;erved wor&s;e than contempt at their hands, he was glad to come off &s;o cheaply, and contented him&s;elf with muttering cur&s;es and threats again&s;t the apothecary, who (as he imagined) having got an inkling of the ap|pointment with his wife, had taken revenge of him in the manner de&s;cribed. By that time he had got a new &s;carf &s;kin, his character was become &s;o notorious, that he thought it high time for him to decamp; and his retreat he performed in one night without beat of drum, after having robbed his own &s;ervant of every thing that belong|ed to him, except the clothes he had on his back. A few days after he di&s;appeared. Mr. Lavement, for his own &s;ecurity, took into cu&s;tody a large old trunk which he had left, and as it was very heavy, made no que&s;tion that the contents were &s;ufficient to indemnify him for what Odon|nell owed in lodging. But a month being elap&s;ed without hearing any tidings of this adventurer, and my ma&s;ter being impatient to know what the trunk contained, he ordered me to break it open in his pre&s;ence; which ta&s;k I performed with the pe&s;tle of our great mortar, and di&s;|covered, to his inexpre&s;&s;ible a&s;toni&s;hment and mortification, a heap of &s;tones.</P>
<P>About this time my friend Strap informed me of an offer he had to go abroad with a gentleman in quality of valet de chambre, and at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ured me, that, what|ever advantage he might propo&s;e to him&s;elf from this pro&s;pect, he could not bear the thoughts of parting from me, &s;o much was he attached to my fortune. In &s;pite of all the obligations I owed to this poor hone&s;t fellow, in|gratitude is &s;o natural to the heart of man, that I began
<PB N="120" REF="027715_0127_0FD5EC5C577BFE50">
to be tired of his acquaintance, and, now that I had con|tracted other friend&s;hips which appeared more creditable, was even a&s;hamed to &s;ee a journeyman barber inquiring after me with the familiarity of a companion. I therefore, on pretence of con&s;ulting his welfare, in&s;i&s;ted upon his ac|cepting the propo&s;al, which he at la&s;t determined to em|brace with great reluctance, and in a few days took his leave of me, &s;hedding a flood of tears, which I could not behold without emotion. I now began to look upon my|&s;elf as a gentleman in reality, learned to dance of a French|man whom I had cured of a fa&s;hionable di&s;temper, fre|quented plays during the holidays, became the oracle of an ale-hou&s;e, where every di&s;pute was referred to my de|ci&s;ion, and at length contracted an acquaintance with a young lady, who found means to make a conque&s;t of my heart, and upon whom I prevailed, after much attendance and &s;olicitation, to give me a promi&s;e of marriage. As this beautiful creature pa&s;&s;ed for a rich heire&s;s, I ble&s;&s;ed my good fortune, and was actually on the point of crown|ing all my wi&s;hes by matrimony&mdash;when one morning I went to her lodgings, and, her maid being abroad, took the privilege of a bridegroom to enter her chamber, where, to my utter confu&s;ion, I found her in bed with a man. Heaven gave me patience and pre&s;ence of mind enough to withdraw immediately, and I thanked my &s;tars a thou&s;and times for the happy di&s;covery, by which I re&s;olved to pro|fit &s;o much as to abandon all thoughts of marriage for the future.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Squire Gawky comes to lodge with my ma&s;ter&mdash;is involved in a trouble&s;ome affair, out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f which he is extricated by me&mdash;he marries my ma&s;ter's daughter&mdash;they con&s;pire again&s;t me&mdash;I am found guilty of theft&mdash;di&s;charged&mdash;d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;erted by my friends&mdash;I hire a room in St. Giles's&mdash;where, by accident, I find the lady to whom I made my addre&s;&s;es, in a mi&s;er|able condition&mdash;I relieve her.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE I enjoyed my&s;elf at large in this temper of mind, Mr. Lavement let his fir&s;t floor to my coun|tryman and acquaintance Squire Gawky, who by this time
<PB N="121" REF="027715_0128_0FD5EC5DDEBFE708">
had got a lieutenancy in the army, and &s;uch a martial fe|rocity in his appearance, that I was afraid he would re|member what had happened between us in Scotland, and atone for his breach of appointment then, by his punctu|ality now; but whether he had actually forgotten me, or was willing to make me believe &s;o, he betrayed not the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of recognition at &s;ight of me, and I remained quite cured of my apprehen&s;ion, though I had occa&s;ion, not long after, to be convinced, that, how&s;oever his ex|ternals might be altered, he was at bottom the &s;ame indi|vidual Gawky whom I have already de&s;cribed: for, coming home late one night from the hou&s;e of a patient, I heard a noi&s;e in the &s;treet, and, as I approached, perceived two gentlemen in cu&s;tody of three watchmen. The pri&s;oners, who were mi&s;erably disfigured with dirt, complained bit|terly of the lo&s;s of their hats and wigs, and one of them, whom by his tongue I knew to be a Scotchman, lamented piteou&s;ly, offering a guinea for his liberty, which the watchman refu&s;ed, alledging that one of his companions was wounded grievou&s;ly, and that he mu&s;t &s;tand to the con&s;equence. My prejudice in favour of my native country was &s;o &s;trong, that I could not bear to &s;ee any body be|longing to it in di&s;tre&s;s, and therefore, with one blow of my faithful cudgel, knocked down the watchman who had hold of the per&s;on for whom I was chiefly concerned, He was no &s;ooner di&s;engaged than he betook him&s;elf to his heels, and left me to maintain the di&s;pute as I &s;hould think proper; and indeed I came off but &s;curvily; for, before I could avail my&s;elf of my &s;peed, I received a blow on the eye, from one of the other two, that had well nigh de|prived me of the u&s;e of that organ; however, I made &s;hift to get home, where I was informed of Captain Gawky's being robbed and abu&s;ed by a company of footpads, and was ordered by my ma&s;ter to prepare an emollient gly&s;ter and paregoric draught, in order to allay and compo&s;e the ferment of his &s;pirits, occa&s;ioned by the barbarous treat|ment he had undergone, while he took twelve ounces of blood from him immediately. When I inquired into the particulars of this adventure, and under&s;tood by the &s;er|vant, that he came in ju&s;t before me without hat and wig, I made no &s;cruple of believing him to be the per&s;on I had relea&s;ed, and was confirmed in that belief upon hearing his
<PB N="122" REF="027715_0129_0FD5EC5EF6663178">
voice, to which (before that event) I had been &s;o long a &s;tranger. My eye being con&s;iderably &s;welled and inflamed, I could not reflect upon my enterpri&s;e without cur&s;ing my own folly, and even re&s;olving to declare the truth of the whole &s;tory, in order to be revenged on the cowardly wretch for whom I had &s;uffered. Accordingly, next day, after he had told in pre&s;ence of my ma&s;ter, his wife, and daughter, who came to vi&s;it him, a thou&s;and lies concern|ing the prowe&s;s he had &s;hewn in making his e&s;cape, I ven|tured to explain the my&s;tery, and, calling in the evidence of my contu&s;ed eye, upbraided him with cowardice and ingratitude. Gawky was &s;o a&s;toni&s;ted at this di&s;cour&s;e, that he could not &s;peak one word, and the re&s;t of the company &s;tared at one another, till at length my mi&s;tre&s;s reprimanded me for my in&s;olent behaviour, and threatened to turn me away for my pre&s;umption: upon which Gawky (having recollected him&s;elf) ob&s;erved, as the young man might have mi&s;taken another per&s;on for him, he could for|give his in&s;inuations, more e&s;pecially as he &s;eemed to have &s;uffered for his civility, but advi&s;ed me to be more certain in my conjectures for the future, before I ventured to pub|li&s;h them to the prejudice of any man. Mi&s;s applauded the captain's genero&s;ity in pardoning one who had &s;o villain|ou&s;ly a&s;per&s;ed him, and I began to imagine her prai&s;e was not at all di&s;intere&s;ted. But the apothecary, who perhaps had more penetration or le&s;s partiality than his wife and daughter, differed from them in his &s;entiments of the mat|ter, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me in the &s;hop in this man|ner: <Q><HI>Ah mon pauvre Roderique!</HI> you ave more of de veracite dan of de prudence&mdash;bot mine vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e and dater be <HI>diablement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">age,</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;. le capitaine un &s;anfaron, pardieu&punc;</HI></Q> This eulogium on his wife and daughter, though &s;poken ironically by him, was neverthele&s;s literally ju&s;t; by e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of Gawky, the one obliged a valuable lodger, and the other acquired a hu&s;band at a juncture when one was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; for the young lady, finding the effects of her corre&s;pondence with Odon|nell becoming plainer and plainer every day, in&s;inuated her&s;elf &s;o artfully into the affections of this new lodger, that in le&s;s than a fortnight, on pretence of going to a play, they drove away together to the Fleet, where they were coupled, from thence removed to a bagnio, where the
<PB N="123" REF="027715_0130_0FD5EC611B17AF28">
marriage was con&s;ummated, and in the morning came home, where they a&s;ked her father's and mother's ble&s;&s;ing. The prudent parents, notwith&s;tanding the precipitation with which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was carried on, did not think fit to refu&s;e their approbation; for the apothecary was not ill plea&s;ed to find his daughter married to a young man of a good pro&s;pect, who had not mentioned to him one &s;yllable on the article of her dowery; and his wife was rejoiced at being rid of a rival in her gallants, and a &s;py upon her plea&s;ures. Nor was I without &s;elf-enjoyment at this event, when I reflected upon the revenge I had unwittingly taken upon my enemy in making him a cuckold by anticipation. But I little dreamed what a &s;torm of mi&s;chief was brewing again&s;t me, whil&s;t I thus indulged my&s;elf. Whatever face Gawky put on the matter, my di&s;covery of the adventure before related, and the reproaches I vented again&s;t him, had &s;tung him to the &s;oul, and cheri&s;hed the &s;eeds of en|mity &s;o &s;trongly in his brea&s;t, that he (it &s;eems) imparted his indignation to his wife, who, being as de&s;irous as him|&s;elf to compa&s;s the ruin of one that had not only &s;lighted her care&s;&s;es, but was able on any occa&s;ion to di&s;cover particulars not at all advantageous to her character, rea|dily joined in a con&s;piracy again&s;t me, which (had it taken effect as they expected) would infallibly have brought me to an ignominious death.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter, having &s;everal times mi&s;&s;ed large quantities <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> medicines of which I could give no account, at la&s;t lo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> patience, and in plain terms taxed me with having em|bezzled them for my own u&s;e. As I could only oppo&s;e my &s;ingle a&s;&s;everation to his &s;u&s;picion, he told me one day, <Q>By Gar, your vord not be give me de &s;atisfaction&mdash;me find <HI>nece&s;&s;aire</HI> to <HI>chercher</HI> for my medicine&mdash;<HI>pardonnez moi&mdash;il faut chercher</HI>&mdash;me demand <HI>le clef</HI> of your <HI>coffre a cette huere.</HI></Q> Then rai&s;ing his voice to conceal the right he was in, le&s;t I &s;hould make any oppo&s;ition, he went on, <Q><HI>Oui, foutre,</HI> I charge you <HI>rendez le clef</HI> of your <HI>coffre&mdash;moi&mdash;&s;i, moi qui vous parle.</HI></Q> I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ired with &s;o much re&s;entment and di&s;dain at this accu&s;ation, that I bur&s;t into tears, which he took for a &s;ign of guilt; and, pulling out my key, told him he might &s;atisfy him|&s;elf immediately, though he would not find it &s;o ea&s;y to &s;atisfy me for the injury my reputation had &s;uffered from
<PB N="124" REF="027715_0131_0FD5EC6120153608">
his unju&s;t &s;u&s;picion. He took the key, and mounted up to my chamber, attended by the whole family&mdash;&s;aying, "<HI>Eh bien, nous v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s&mdash;n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">us verrons.</HI>" But what was my horror and amazement, when, opening my che&s;t, he pulled out a handful of the very things that were mi&s;&s;ing, and pronounced, <Q><HI>Ah ha! vous etes bien venus&mdash;mardie, Mon&s;. R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">derique,</HI> you be <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rt innocent!</HI></Q> I had not power to utter one word in my own vindication, but &s;tood motionle&s;s and &s;ilent, while every body pre&s;ent made their re&s;pective remarks on what appeared again&s;t me. The &s;ervants &s;aid they were &s;orrow for my misfortune, and went away repeating, "Who would have thought it!" My mi&s;tre&s;s took occa&s;ion from this detection to rail again&s;t the practice of employing &s;trangers in general, and Mrs. Gawky, after having ob&s;erved that &s;he never had a good opinion of my fidelity, propo&s;ed to have me carried before the ju&s;tice, and committed to Newgate immediately. Her hu&s;band was actually upon the &s;tairs in his way for a con|&s;table, when Mr. Lavement, knowing the co&s;t and trou|ble of a pro&s;ecution to which he mu&s;t bind him&s;elf, and at the &s;ame time dreading le&s;t &s;ome particulars of my con|fe&s;&s;ion might affect his practice, called out, <Q><HI>Re&s;tez, mon fils! re&s;tez;</HI> it be <HI>veritablement</HI> one grand crime which dis <HI>pauvre diable</HI> have committed&mdash;bot <HI>peutetre</HI> de good God give him de penitence, and me vil not have upon my head de blood of one &s;inner.</Q> The captain and his lady u&s;ed all the Chri&s;tian arguments their zeal could &s;ug|ge&s;t to prevail upon the apothecary to pur&s;ue me to de&s;truc|tion, and repre&s;ented the inju&s;tice he did to the commu|nity, of which he was a member, in letting a villain e&s;cape, who would not fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l of doing more mi&s;chief in the world, when he &s;hould reflect on his coming off &s;o ea&s;ily now:&mdash;but their eloquence made no impre&s;&s;ion upon my ma&s;ter, who, turning to me, &s;aid, <Q>Go, mi&s;erable, go from mine hou&s;e, quick, quick&mdash;and make reparation for your <HI>mauvai&s;e</HI> actions.</Q> By this time my indignation had rou&s;ed me from the &s;tupe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">action in which I had hitherto remained, and I began in this manner: <Q>Sir, appearances, I own, condemn me; but you are impo&s;ed upon as much as I am abu&s;ed&mdash;I have fallen a &s;acrifice to the rancour of that &s;coundrel,</Q> pointing to Gawky, <Q>who has found means to convey your goods thither, that the
<PB N="125" REF="027715_0132_0FD5EC629C6CEE88">
detection of them might bla&s;t my reputation, and ac|compli&s;h my de&s;truction. His hatred of me is owing to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his having wronged me in my own country, for which injury he in a cowardly manner re|fu&s;ed me the &s;atisfaction of a gentleman&mdash;he knows, moreover, that I am no &s;tranger to his da&s;tardly beha|viour in this town, which I have recounted before&mdash;and he is unwilling that &s;uch a te&s;timony of his ingratitude and pu&s;illanimity &s;hould live upon the earth; for this rea&s;on he is guilty of the mo&s;t infernal malice to bring about my ruin&mdash;And I am afraid, Madam,</Q> turning to Mrs. Gawky, <Q>you have too ea&s;ily entered into the &s;entiments of your hu&s;band&mdash;I have often found you my enemy, and am well acquainted with the occa&s;ion of your being &s;o, which I don't at pre&s;ent think proper to declare; but I would not advi&s;e you, for your own &s;ake, to drive me to an extremity.</Q> This addre&s;s en|raged her &s;o much, that with a face as red as &s;carlet, and the eyes of a fury, &s;he &s;trutted up to me, and, putting her hands on her &s;ides, &s;pit in my face, &s;aying, I was a &s;can|dalous villain, but &s;he defied my malice&mdash;and that, unle&s;s her papa would pro&s;ecute me like a thief as I was, &s;he would not &s;tay another night under his roof. At the &s;ame time Gawky, a&s;&s;uming his big look, told me he &s;corned what lies I could invent again&s;t him, but that, if I pre|tended to a&s;per&s;e his wife, he would put me to death, by G&mdash;d. To this threat I an&s;wered, <Q>I wi&s;h to God I could meet with thee in a de&s;ert, that I might have an opportunity of puni&s;hing thee for thy perfidy towards me, and rid the world of &s;uch a ra&s;cal&mdash;What hinders me this moment,</Q> &s;aid I, &s;eizing an old bottle that &s;tood by, "from doing my&s;elf that ju&s;tice?" I had no &s;ooner armed my&s;elf in this manner than Gawky and his father-in-law retired in &s;uch a hurry, that the one over|turned the other, and they rolled together down &s;tairs, while my mi&s;tre&s;s &s;wooned away with fear, and her daugh|ter a&s;ked if I intended to murder her. I gave her to under|&s;tand that nothing was farther from my intention; that I would leave her to the &s;tings of her own con&s;cience, but was firmly re&s;olved to flit her hu&s;band's no&s;e, whenever fortune &s;hould offer a convenient opportunity. Then, going down &s;tairs, I met Lavement coming up trembling with the
<PB N="126" REF="027715_0133_0FD5EC642F2E6268">
pe&s;tle in his hand, and Gawky behind armed with his &s;word, pu&s;hing him forward. I demanded a parley; and, having a&s;&s;ured them of my pacific di&s;po&s;ition, Gawky exclaimed, "Ah! villain! you have killed my dear wife;" and the apothecary cried, "<HI>Ah coquin!</HI> vere is my &s;hild?" "The lady," &s;aid I, <Q>is above &s;tairs unhurt by me, and will in a few months hence, I believe, reward your concern.</Q> Here &s;he called to them, and de&s;ired they would let the wretch go, and trouble them&s;elves no farther about him: to which reque&s;t her father con&s;ented, ob&s;erving neverthele&s;s, that my conver&s;ation was <HI>fort my&s;terieu&s;e.</HI> Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to vindicate my innocence, I left the hou&s;e immediately, and went to the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, with an intention of clear|ing my&s;elf to him, and a&s;king his advice with regard to my future conduct; but, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible vexation, was told he was gone to the country, where he would &s;tay two three days. I returned with a de&s;ign of con&s;ulting &s;ome acquaintance I had acquired in my ma&s;ter's neighbour|hood; but my &s;tory had taken air through the officiou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;ervants, and not one of my friends would vouch&s;afe me a hearing. Thus I found my&s;elf, by the iniquity of mankind, in a much more deplorable condition than ever; for, though I had been formerly as poor, my reputation was without blemi&s;h, and my health unimpaired till now&mdash;but at pre&s;ent my good name was lo&s;t, my money gone, my friends were alienated, my body was infected with a di&s;temper contracted in the cour&s;e of an amour, and my faithful Strap, who alone could yield me pity and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, ab&s;ent I knew not where.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t re&s;olution I could take in this melancholy con|juncture, was to remove my clothes to the hou&s;e of the per&s;on with whom I had formerly lodged, where I remain|ed two days, in hope of getting another place by the in|tere&s;t of Mr. Concordance, to whom I made no doubt of being able to vindicate my character: but in this &s;uppo|&s;ition I reckoned without my ho&s;t; for Lavement took care to be before-hand with me; and, when I attempted to explain the whole affair to the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, I found him &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t me, that he would &s;carce hear me to an end; but, when I had fini&s;hed my ju&s;tification, &s;hook his head, and beginning with his u&s;ual exclamation, "O Ch&mdash;&s;t!" &s;aid he, <Q>that won't go down with me.

<P>One day when I &s;at in this &s;olitary retreat, mu&s;ing upon the unhappine&s;s of my fate, I was alarmed by a groan that i&s;&s;ued from a chamber contiguous to mine, in|to which I immediately ran, and found a woman &s;tretch|ed on a mi&s;erable truckle-bed, without any vi&s;ible &s;igns of life. Having applied a &s;melling bottle to her no&s;e, the blood began to revi&s;it her cheeks, and &s;he opened her eyes; but, good heaven! what were the emotions of my &s;oul, when I di&s;covered her to be the &s;ame individual la|dy, who had triumphed over my heart, and to who&s;e fate I had almo&s;t been in&s;eparably joined! Her deplorable

&s;ituation filled my brea&s;t with compa&s;&s;ion, and every tender idea reviving in my imagination, I flew into her embrace. She knew me immediately; an &s;training me gently in her arms, &s;hed a torrent of tears, which I could not help increa&s;ing: at length, ca&s;ting a langui&s;hing look at me, &s;he pronounced with a feeble voice, <Q>Dear Mr. Ran|dom, I do not de&s;erve this concern at your hands&mdash;I am a vile creature, who had a ba&s;e de&s;ign upon your per&s;on&mdash;&s;uffer me to expiate that and all my other crimes by a mi&s;erable death, which will not fail to overtake me in a few hours.</Q> I encouraged her as much as I could, told her I forgave all her intentions with regard to me; and that although my circum&s;tances were extremely low, I would &s;hare my la&s;t farthing with her. In the mean time begged to know the immediate cau&s;e of that fit, from which &s;he had ju&s;t recovered, and &s;aid I would endeavour by my &s;kill to prevent any more &s;uch attacks. She &s;eemed very much affected with this ex|pre&s;&s;ion, took my hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips, &s;aying, <Q>You are too generous! I wi&s;h I could live to expre&s;s my gratitude&mdash;but alas! I peri&s;h for want.</Q> Then &s;hutting her eyes, &s;he relap&s;ed into another &s;woon. Such extremity of di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t have waked the mo&s;t obdurate heart to &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion; what effect then mu&s;t it have had on mine, that was naturally prone to every tender pa&s;&s;ion? I ran down &s;tairs, and &s;ent my landlady to a chymi&s;t's &s;hop for &s;ome cinnamon-water, while I, return|ing to this unfortunate creature's chamber, u&s;ed all the means in my power to bring her to her&s;elf: this aim, with much difficulty I accompli&s;hed, and made her drink a gla&s;s of the cordial to recruit her &s;pirits; then I prepared a lit|tle mulled red wine and a toa&s;t, which having taken, &s;he found her&s;elf thoroughly revived, and informed me, that &s;he had not ta&s;ted food for eight and forty hours before. As I was impatient to know the occa&s;ion and nature of her calamity, &s;he gave me to under&s;tand, that &s;he was a woman of the town by pro&s;e&s;&s;ion; that, in the cour&s;e of her adventures, &s;he found her&s;elf dangerou&s;ly infected with a di&s;temper to which all of her cla&s;s are particularly &s;ub|ject; that, her malady gaining ground every day, &s;he be|came loath&s;ome to her&s;elf, and offen&s;ive to others, when &s;he re&s;olved to retire to &s;ome ob&s;cure corner, where &s;he

<P>The hi&s;tory of Mi&s;s Williams.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY father was an eminent merchant in the city, who having, in the cour&s;e of trade, &s;uffered very con&s;i|derable lo&s;&s;es, retired in his old age with his wife to a &s;mall e&s;tate in the country, which he had purcha&s;ed with the remains of his fortune. At that time I being but eight years of age, was left in town for the convenience of education, boarded with an aunt, who was a rigid Pre&s;byterian, and who confined me &s;o clo&s;ely to what &s;he
<PB N="130" REF="027715_0137_0FD5EC6EACD1C140">
called the duties of religion, that in time I grew weary of her doctrines, and by degrees conceived an aver&s;ion for the good books &s;he daily recommended to my peru&s;al. As I increa&s;ed in age, and appeared with a per&s;on not di&s;agreeable, I contracted a good deal of acquaintance among my own &s;ex; one of whom, after having lamented the re&s;traint I was under from the narrowne&s;s of my aunt's &s;entiments, told me, I mu&s;t now throw off the prejudices of opinion imbibed under her influence and example, and learn to think for my&s;elf; for which purpo&s;e &s;he advi&s;ed me to read Shaft&s;bury, Tindal, Hobbs, and all the books that are remarkable for their deviation from the old way of thinking, and by comparing one with another, I &s;hould &s;oon be able to form a &s;y&s;tem of my own. I fol|lowed her advice, and whether it was owing to my pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t what I had formerly read, or the clear|ne&s;s of argument in the&s;e my new in&s;tructors, I know not, but I &s;tudied them with plea&s;ure, and in a &s;hort time became a profe&s;&s;ed free-thinker. Proud of my new im|provement, I argued in all companies, and that with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that I &s;oon acquired the reputation of a philo&s;o|pher, and few people dur&s;t undertake me in a di&s;pute. I grew vain upon my good fortune, and at length pretend|ed to make my aunt a pro&s;elyte to my opinion; but &s;he no &s;ooner perceived my drift, than taking the alarm, &s;he wrote to my father an account of my here&s;y, and conjur|ed him, as he tendered the good of my &s;oul, to remove me immediately from the dangerous place where I had contracted &s;uch &s;inful principles; accordingly, my father ordered me into the country, where I arrived in the fif|teenth year of my age, and, by his command, gave him a detail of all the articles of my faith, which he did not find &s;o unrea&s;onable as they had been repre&s;ented.&mdash;Find|ing my&s;elf &s;uddenly deprived of the company and plea|&s;ures of the town, I grew melancholy, and it was &s;ome time before I could reli&s;h my &s;ituation.&mdash;But &s;olitude be|came every day more and more familiar to me, and I con|&s;oled my&s;elf in my retreat with the enjoyment of a good library, at &s;uch times as were not employed in the ma|nagement of the family, (for my mother had been dead three years,) in vi&s;iting, or &s;ome other party of rural di|ver&s;ion.&mdash;Having more imagination than judgment, I

ad|dicted my&s;elf too much to poetry and romance; and in &s;hort was looked upon as a very extraordinary per&s;on by every body in the country where I re&s;ided.&mdash;I had one evening &s;trayed, with a book in my hand, into a wood that bordered on the high road, at a little di&s;tance from my father's hou&s;e; when a certain drunken &s;quire0, riding by, perceived me, and crying, <Q>Z&mdash;ds! there's charm|ing creature!</Q> alighted in a moment, caught me in his arms, and treated me &s;o rudely, that I &s;hrieked as loud as I&punc; could, and in the mean time oppo&s;ed his violence with all the &s;trength that rage and re&s;entment could in&s;pire.&mdash;During this &s;truggle, another hor&s;eman came up, who, &s;eeing a lady &s;o unworthily u&s;ed, di&s;mounted and flew to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;My ravi&s;her, mad with di&s;appointment, or provoked with the reproaches of the other gentleman, quitted me, and running to his hor&s;e, drew a pi&s;tol from the &s;addle, and fired at my protector, who happily re|ceiving no damage, went up, and with the but-end of his whip laid him pro&s;trate on the ground, before he could u&s;e the other, which his antagoni&s;t immediately &s;eized, and clapping to the &s;quire's brea&s;t, threatened to put him to death for his cowardice and treachery. In this dilem|ma I interpo&s;ed and begged his life, which was granted to my reque&s;t, after he had a&s;ked pardon, and &s;wore his intention was only to obtain a ki&s;s.&mdash;However, my de|fender thought proper to unload the other pi&s;tol, and throw away the flints, before he gave him his liberty.&mdash;This courteous &s;tranger conducted me home, where my father, having learned the &s;ignal &s;ervice he had done me, loaded him with care&s;&s;es, and in&s;i&s;ted on his lodging that night at our hou&s;e.&mdash;If the obligation he had conferred upon me ju&s;tly in&s;pired me with &s;entiments of gratitude, his appearance and conver&s;ation &s;eemed to intitle him to &s;omewhat more.&mdash;He was about the age of two and twenty, among the talle&s;t of the middle &s;ize; had che&s;|nut coloured hair, which he wore tied up in a ribbon; a high poli&s;hed forehead, a no&s;e inclining to the aqualine, lively blue eyes, red pouting lips, teeth as white as &s;now, and a certain openne&s;s of countenance.&mdash;But what need I de&s;cribe any more particulars of his per&s;on? I hope you will do me the ju&s;tice to believe I do not flatter, when I &s;ay he was the exact re&s;emblance of you; and if I had

All night long my imagination formed a thou&s;and ridi|culous expectations: there was &s;o much of knight-er|rantry in this gentleman's coming to the relief of a dam|&s;el of di&s;tre&s;s, with whom he immediately became ena|moured, that all I had read of love and chivalry recurred to my fancy, and I looked upon my&s;elf as a prince&s;s in &s;ome region of romance, who, being delivered from the power of a brutal giant or &s;atyr by a generous Oroondates, was bound in gratitude, as well as led by inclination, to yield up my affections to him without re&s;erve. In vain did I endeavour to cha&s;ti&s;e the&s;e fooli&s;h conceits by re|flections more rea&s;onable and &s;evere: the amu&s;ing images took full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my mind, and my dreams repre|&s;ented my hero, &s;ighing at my feet, in the language of a de&s;pairing lover.&mdash;Next morning after breakfa&s;t he took his leave, when my father begged the favour of further acquaintance with him; to which reque&s;t he replied by a compliment to him, and a look to me &s;o full of eloquence and tenderne&s;s, that my whole &s;oul received the &s;oft im|pre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;In a &s;hort time he repeated his vi&s;it; and, as a recital of the particular &s;teps he pur&s;ued to ruin me, would be too tedious and impertinent; let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, he made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into my e&s;teem, by convincing me of his own good &s;en&s;e, and at the &s;ame time flattering my under&s;tanding: this ta&s;k he performed in the mo&s;t artful manner, by &s;eeming to contradict me often through mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, that I might have an op|portunity of clearing my&s;elf, the more to my own

ho|nour. Having thus &s;ecured my good opinion, he began to give me &s;ome tokens of a particular pa&s;&s;ion founded on a veneration for the qualities of my mind, and as an ac|cidental ornament, admired the beauties of my per&s;on; till at length, being fully per&s;uaded of his conque&s;t, he cho&s;e a proper &s;ea&s;on for the theme, and di&s;clo&s;ed his love in terms &s;o ardent and &s;incere, that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for me to di&s;gui&s;e the &s;entiments of my heart, and he receiv|ed my approbation with the mo&s;t lively tran&s;port. After this mutual declaration, we contrived to meet more fre|quently in private interviews, where we enjoyed the con|ver&s;ation of one another, in all the elevation of fancy and impatience of hope, that reciprocal adoration can in&s;pire. He profe&s;&s;ed his honourable intentions, of which I made no que&s;tion, lamented the avaricious di&s;po&s;ition of his fa|ther, who had de&s;tined him for the arms of another, and vowed eternal fidelity with &s;uch an appearance of candour and devotion, that I became a dupe to his deceit, and in an evil hour crowned his eager de&s;ire with full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Cur&s;ed be the day on which I gave away my innocence and peace for momentary gratification, which has en|tailed upon me &s;uch mi&s;ery and horror! cur&s;ed be my beauty that fir&s;t attracted the attention of the &s;educer! cur&s;ed be my education, that, by refi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing my &s;entiments, made my heart the more &s;u&s;ceptible! cur&s;ed be my good &s;en&s;e, that fixed me to one object, and taught me the pre|ference I enjoyed was but my due! Had I been ugly, no body would have tempted me; had I been ignorant, the charms of my per&s;on would not have atoned for the coar&s;e|ne&s;s of my conver&s;ation; had I been giddy, my vanity would have divided my inclinations, and my ideas would have been &s;o diffu&s;ed, that I &s;hould never have li&s;tened to the enchantments of one alone.</P>
<P>But to return to my unfortunate &s;tory: we gave a loo&s;e to guilty plea&s;ure, which for &s;ome months bani&s;hed every other concern.&mdash;At la&s;t, by degrees, his vi&s;its became le&s;s frequent, and his behaviour le&s;s warm: I perceived his coldne&s;s, my heart took the alarm, my tears reproached him, and I in&s;i&s;ted upon the performance of his promi&s;e to e&s;pou&s;e me, that, whatever &s;hould happen, my re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|tation might be &s;afe: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;eemed to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> pro|po&s;al, and left me on pretence of finding a proper clergy|man

Rage took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul; I de|nounced a thou&s;and imprecations, and formed as many &s;chemes of revenge again&s;t the traitor who had undone me! Then my re&s;entment would &s;ub&s;ide to &s;ilent &s;orrow: I recalled the tranquillity I had lo&s;t, I wept over my in|fatuation, and &s;ometime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of hope would intervene, and for a moment cheer my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> heart; I would re|volve all the favourable circum&s;tances of his character, repeat the vows he made, a&s;cribe his ab&s;ence to the vigi|lance of a &s;u&s;picious father who compelled him to a match his &s;oul abhorred, and comfort my&s;elf with the expecta|tion of &s;eeing him before the thing &s;hould be brought to any terms of agreement.&mdash;But how vain was my imagi|nation! The villain left me without remor&s;e, and in a few days the news of his marriage was &s;pread all over the coun|try.&mdash;My horror was then inconceivable! and had not the de&s;ire of revenge diverted the re&s;olution, I &s;hould infallibly have put an end to my mi&s;erable life.&mdash;My father ob&s;erv|ed the &s;ymptoms of my de&s;pair; and, though I have good rea&s;on to believe he gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e, was at a great deal of pains to &s;eem ignorant of my affliction, while he en|deavoured with paternal fondne&s;s to alleviate my di&s;tre&s;&s;es. I &s;aw his concern, which increa&s;ed my angui&s;h, and rai&s;ed my fury again&s;t the author of my calamity to an implaca|ble degree. Having furni&s;hed my&s;elf with a little money, I made an elopement from this unhappy parent in the night-time, and, about break of day, arrived at a &s;mall town, from whence a &s;tage coach &s;et out for London, in
<PB N="135" REF="027715_0142_0FD5EC7A9D94F3C8">
which I embarked, and next day alighted in town; the &s;pirit of revenge having &s;upported me all the way again&s;t every other reflection.&mdash;My fir&s;t care was to hire a lodg|ing, in which I kept my&s;elf very retired, having a&s;&s;umed a feigned name, that my character and &s;ituation might be the better concealed. It was not long before I found out the hou&s;e of my ravi&s;her, whither I immediately repaired in a tran&s;port of rage, determined to act &s;ome de&s;perate deed for the &s;atisfaction of my de&s;pair, though the hurry of my &s;pirits would not permit me to concert or re&s;olve upon a particular plan. When I demanded admi&s;&s;ion to Lothario, (&s;o let me call him,) I was de&s;ired to &s;end up my name and bu&s;ine&s;s; but this I refu&s;ed, telling the por|ter I had bu&s;ine&s;s for his ma&s;ter's private ear: upon which I was conducted into a parlour until he &s;hould be informed of my reque&s;t.&mdash;There I remained about a quar|ter of an hour, when a &s;ervant entered and told me his ma&s;ter was engaged with company, and begged to be ex|cu&s;ed at that time.&mdash;My temper could hold out no long|er: I pulled a poniard from my bo&s;om, where I had concealed it, and ru&s;hing out, flew up &s;tairs like a fury, exclaiming, <Q>Where is this perfidious villain! Could I once plunge this dagger into his fal&s;e heart, I &s;hould then die &s;atisfied.</Q> The noi&s;e I made alarmed not on|ly the &s;ervants, but the company al&s;o, who, hearing my threats, came forwards to the &s;tair-ca&s;e to &s;ee what was the matter. I was &s;eized, di&s;armed, and with-held by two footmen; and in this &s;ituation felt the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torture in beholding my undoer approach with his young wife. I could not endure the &s;ight, was deprived of my &s;en&s;es, and fell into a &s;evere fit, during which I know not how I was treated; but when I recovered the u&s;e of re|flection, found my&s;elf on a bed in a paultry apartment, where I was attended by an old woman, who a&s;ked a thou&s;and impertinent que&s;tions relating to my condition; and informed me that my behaviour had thrown the whole family into confu&s;ion; that Lothario affirmed that I was mad, and propo&s;ed to have me &s;ent to Bedlam: but my lady per&s;uaded her&s;elf there was more in my conduct than he cared &s;hould be known, and had taken to her bed on bare &s;u&s;picion, having fir&s;t ordered that I &s;hould be narrowly looked to. I heard all &s;he &s;aid without making any other

The agitation of my thoughts produced a fever, which brought on a mi&s;car|riage; and I believe it is well for my con&s;cience that hea|ven thus di&s;po&s;ed of my burden; for, let me own to you with penitence and horror, if I had brought a living child into the world, my frenzy would have prompted me to &s;acrifice the little innocent to my re&s;entment of the fa|ther's infidelity.</P>
<P>After this event my rage abated, and my hate became more deliberate and calm; when one day my landlady in|formed me, that there was a gentleman below, who de&s;ir|ed to &s;ee me, he having &s;omething of con&s;equence to im|part, which he was &s;ure would contribute to my peace of mind. I was exceedingly alarmed at this declaration, which I attempted to interpret a thou&s;and ways; and, before I came to any determination, he entered my room with an apology for intruding upon me again&s;t my knowledge or con&s;ent. I &s;urveyed him &s;ome time, and, not being able to recollect his face, demanded with a faultering accent, what his bu&s;ine&s;s was with me? upon which he de&s;ired I would give him a particular audience, and he did not doubt of communicating &s;omething that would conduce to my &s;atisfaction and repo&s;e. As I thought my&s;elf &s;ufficiently guarded again&s;t any violence, I granted his reque&s;t, and bade the woman withdraw. The &s;tranger, then advancing gave me to under&s;tand, that he was well acquainted with the particulars of my &s;tory, having been informed of them from Lothario's own mouth&mdash;that, from the time he knew my misfortunes, he had entertained a dete&s;tation for the author of them, which had of late been increa&s;ed and in|flamed to a de&s;ire of revenge by a piece of di&s;honourable conduct towards him&mdash;that, hearing of my melancholy &s;ituation he had come with an intention of offering his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and comfort, and was ready to e&s;pou&s;e my quar|rel, and forthwith take vengeance on my &s;educer, provided I would grant him one con&s;ideration, which he hoped I &s;hould &s;ee no rea&s;on to refu&s;e. Had all the artifice of hell been employed in compo&s;ing a per&s;ua&s;ive, it could not

have had a more in&s;tantaneous or favourable effect than this di&s;cour&s;e had upon me. I was tran&s;ported with a delirium of gloomy joy; I hugged my companion in my arms, and vowed that, if he would make good his promi&s;e, my &s;oul and body &s;hould be at his di&s;po&s;al. The contract was made; he devoted him&s;elf to my revenge, undertook to murder Lothario that very night, and to bring me an ac|count of his death before morning. Accordingly, about two of the clock, he was introduced to my chamber, and a&s;&s;ured me my perfidious lover was no more; that although he was not entitled to &s;uch an honourable proceeding, he had fairly challenged him to the field, where he upbraid|ed him with treachery towards me, for whom, he told him, his &s;word was drawn, and after a few pa&s;&s;es left him weltering in his blood.&mdash;I was &s;o &s;avaged by my wrongs, that I delighted in the recital of this adventure, made him repeat the particulars, fea&s;ted my eyes with the blood that remained on his clothes and &s;word, and yielded up my body as a recompence for the &s;ervice he had done me. My imagination was &s;o engro&s;&s;ed by the&s;e ideas, that in my &s;leep I dreamed Lothario appeared before me, pale, man|gled, and bloody, blamed my ra&s;hne&s;s, prote&s;ted his inno|cence, and pleaded his own cau&s;e &s;o pathetically, that I was convinced of his fidelity, and awakened in a fit of horror and remor&s;e. My bed-fellow endeavoured to &s;ooth, con|&s;ole, and per&s;uade me that I had but barely done ju&s;tice to my&s;elf.&mdash;I dropt a&s;leep again, and the &s;ame apparition recurred to my fancy. In &s;hort, I pa&s;&s;ed the night in great mi&s;ery, and looked upon my avenger with &s;uch ab|horrence, that in the morning, perceiving my aver&s;ion, he in&s;inuated there was &s;till a po&s;&s;ibility of Lothario's recovery; it was true, he left him wounded on the ground, but not quite dead, and perhaps his hurts might not be mortal.&mdash;At the&s;e words I &s;tarted up, bade him fly for in|telligence, and if he could not bring me tidings of Lo|thario's &s;afety, at lea&s;t con&s;ult his own, and never return: for I was re&s;olved to &s;urrender my&s;elf to ju&s;tice, and de|clare all that I knew of the affair, that if po&s;&s;ible I might expiate my own guilt, by incurring the rigours of a &s;in|cere repentance and ignominious death.&mdash;He very coolly repre&s;ented the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of my prejudice again&s;t him, who had done nothing but what his love of me
<PB N="138" REF="027715_0145_0FD5EC8470011BB8">
in|&s;pired, and honour ju&s;tified; that now he had, at the ri&s;k of his life, been &s;ub&s;ervient to my revenge, I was about to di&s;card him as an infamous agent occa&s;ionally nece&s;&s;a|ry: and that even if he &s;hould be &s;o lucky as to bring news of Lothario's &s;afety, it was probable my former re|&s;entment might revive, and I would upbraid him with having failed in his undertaking.&mdash;I a&s;&s;ured him that, on the contrary, he &s;hould be dearer to me than ever, as I then &s;hould be convinced he acted more on the principles of a man of honour, than on tho&s;e of a mercenary a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and &s;corned to take away the life of an adver&s;ary, (how inveterate &s;oever,) which fortune had put in his power.&mdash;"Well then, Madam," &s;aid he, <Q>whatever may have happened, I &s;hall find it no difficult matter to acquit my&s;elf in point of honour.</Q> And took his leave in order to inquire into the con&s;equences of his duel.&mdash;I was now more &s;en&s;ible than ever of the degrees of guilt and mi&s;ery; all the affliction I had &s;uffered hitherto was ow|ing to my own credulity and weakne&s;s, and my con&s;cience could only accu&s;e me of venial crimes: but now that I looked upon my&s;elf as a murderer, it is impo&s;&s;ible to ex|pre&s;s the terrors of my imagination, which was ince&s;&s;antly haunted by the image of the decea&s;ed, and my bo&s;om &s;tung with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite agonies, of which I &s;aw no end. At length, Horatio (for &s;o I &s;hall call my keeper) returned, and telling me I had nothing to fear, delivered into my hands a billet containing the&s;e words.</P>

<P>Being well acquainted with his hand, I had no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect an impo&s;ition in this letter, which I read over and over with a tran&s;port of joy, and care&s;&s;ed Horatio &s;o much, that he appeared the happie&s;t man alive. Thus was I won from de&s;pair by the menaces of a greater misfortune than that which depre&s;&s;ed me. Griefs are like u&s;urpers;

the mo&s;t powerful depo&s;es all the re&s;t. But my raptures were not la&s;ting; that very letter, which in a manner re|e&s;tabli&s;hed my tranquillity, in a little time bani&s;hed my peace. His unju&s;t reproaches, while they waked my re|&s;entment, recalled my former happine&s;s, and filled my &s;oul with rage and &s;orrow. Horatio, perceiving the &s;ituation of my mind, endeavoured to divert my chagrin by treating me with all the amu&s;ements and entertainments of the town. I was gratified with every indulgence I could de|&s;ire, introduced into the company of other kept mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, by whom an uncommon deference was paid to me, and I began to lo&s;e all remembrance of my former condition, when an accident brought it back to my view with all its intere&s;ting circum&s;tances. Diverting my&s;elf one day with &s;ome new&s;papers, which I had not before peru&s;ed, the following adverti&s;ement attracted my attention:</P>
<P><Q>Whereas a young gentlewoman di&s;appeared from her father's hou&s;e in the county of&mdash;, about the end of September, on account (as is &s;uppo&s;ed) of &s;ome unea|&s;ine&s;s of mind, and has not been as yet heard of, who|ever will give any information about her to Mr.&mdash;, of Gray's-inn, &s;hall be hand&s;omely rewarded; or, if &s;he will return to the arms of her di&s;con&s;olate parent, &s;he will be received with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, whatever rea&s;on &s;he may have to think otherwi&s;e, and may be the means of prolonging the life of a father, already weigh|ed down almo&s;t to the grave with age and &s;orrow.</Q></P>
<P>This pathetic remon&s;trance had &s;uch an effect on me, that I was fully re&s;olved to return like the prodigal &s;on, and implore the forgivene&s;s of him who gave me life; but alas! upon inquiry, I found he had paid his debt to na|ture a month before, lamenting my ab&s;ence to his la&s;t hour, having left his fortune to a &s;tranger as a mark of his re|&s;entment of my unkind and undutiful behaviour. Penetra|ted with remor&s;e on this occa&s;ion, I &s;unk into the mo&s;t profound melancholy, and con&s;idered my&s;elf as the imme|diate cau&s;e of his death. I lo&s;t all reli&s;h for company, and indeed mo&s;t of my acquaintance no &s;ooner perceived my change of temper, than they abandoned me. Horatio, di&s;|gu&s;ted at my in&s;en&s;ibility, or (which is more probable) cloyed with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, became colder and colder every day, till at la&s;t he left me altogether, without making any apo|logy

for his conduct, or &s;ecuring me again&s;t the mi&s;eries of want, as a man of honour ought to have done, con&s;i|dering the &s;hare he had in my ruin; for I afterwards learned, that the quarrel between Lothario and him was a &s;tory trumped up to rid the one of my importunities, and give the other the enjoyment of my per&s;on, which, it &s;eems, he lu&s;ted after, upon &s;eeing me at the hou&s;e of my &s;educer. Reduced to this extremity, I cur&s;ed my own &s;im|plicity, uttered horrid imprecations again&s;t the treachery of Horatio, and, as I became every day more and more familiari&s;ed to the lo&s;s of innocence, re&s;olved to be reveng|ed on the &s;ex in general by practi&s;ing their own arts up|on them&s;elves. Nor was an opportunity long wanting: an old gentlewoman, under pretence of &s;ympathi&s;ing, vi&s;ited me, and after having condoled me on my misfortunes, and profe&s;&s;ed a di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip, began to di&s;play the art of her occupation, in encomiums on my beauty, and in|vectives again&s;t the wretch who had for&s;aken me, in&s;inua|ting withal, that it would be my own fault if I did not &s;till make my fortune by the extraordinary qualifications with which nature had endowed me. I &s;oon under&s;tood her drift, and gave her &s;uch encouragement to explain her&s;elf, that we came to an agreement immediately to di|vide the profits of my pro&s;titution accruing from &s;uch gal|lants as &s;he &s;hould introduce to my acquaintance. The fir&s;t &s;troke of my di&s;&s;imulation was practi&s;ed upon a cer|tain j&mdash;ge, to whom I was recommended by this matron as an innocent creature ju&s;t arrived from the country. He was &s;o tran&s;ported with my appearance and feigned &s;im|plicity, that he paid a hundred guineas for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me for one night only, during which I behaved in &s;uch a manner as to make him perfectly well plea&s;ed with his purcha&s;e.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>She is interrupted by a bailiff, who arre&s;ts, and carries her to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea&mdash;I accompany her&mdash;bring witne&s;&s;es to prove &s;he is not the per&s;on named in the writ&mdash;the bailiff is fain to give her a pre&s;ent, and di&s;charge her&mdash;we &s;hift our lodging&mdash;&s;he re&s;umes her &s;tory and ends it&mdash;my reflec|tions thereupon&mdash;&s;he makes me acquainted with the pro|gre&s;s of a common woman of the town&mdash;re&s;olves to quit that way of life.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HER &s;tory was here interrupted by a rap at the door, which was no &s;ooner opened than three or four ter|rible fellows ru&s;hed in, one of whom acco&s;ted my fellow-lodger thus: <Q>Madam, your &s;ervant&mdash;you mu&s;t do me the favour to come along with me&mdash;I have got a writ again&s;t you.</Q> While the bailiff (for &s;o he was) &s;poke thus, his followers &s;urrounded the pri&s;oner, and began to handle her very roughly. This treatment incen&s;ed me &s;o much, that I &s;natched up the poker, and would certainly have u&s;ed it in defence of the lady, without any regard to the &s;trength and number of her adver&s;aries, had &s;he not begged me with a compo&s;ure of countenance, for which I could not account, to u&s;e no violence in her behalf, which could be of no &s;ervice to her, but might be very detrimental to my&s;elf. Then, turning to the leader of this formidable troop, &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee the writ; and, having peru&s;ed it, &s;aid with a faultering voice, <Q>I am not the per&s;on who&s;e name is here mentioned; arre&s;t me at your peril.</Q> "Ay, ay, Madam," repl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d the catchpole, <Q>we &s;hall prove your identity.&mdash;In the mean time, whe|ther will you be plea&s;ed to be carried to my hou&s;e or to jail?</Q>&mdash;"If I mu&s;t be confined," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>I would rather be in your hou&s;e than in a common jail.</Q>&mdash;"Well, well," an&s;wered he, <Q>if you have money enough in your pocket, you &s;hall be entertained like a prince&s;s.</Q> But, when &s;he acquainted him with her poverty, he &s;wore he never gave credit, and ordered one of his myrmidons to call a coach to carry her to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea at once. While they waited for the convenience, &s;he took me a&s;ide, and bade me be under no concern on her account; for &s;he
<PB N="142" REF="027715_0149_0FD5EC8D1CC90C90">
knew how to extricate her&s;elf from this difficulty very &s;oon, and perhaps gain &s;omething by the occa&s;ion. Although her di&s;cour&s;e was a my&s;tery to me, I was very well plea&s;ed with her a&s;&s;urance, and, when the coach came to the door, offered to accompany her to pri&s;on; to which propo&s;al, after much entreaty, &s;he con&s;ented. When we arrived at the gate of the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, our conducto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> alighted, and, having demanded entrance, pre&s;ented the writ to the turn|key, who no &s;ooner perceived the name of Eli&s;abeth Cary than he cried, <Q>Ah hah! my old acquaintance Bett! I'm glad to &s;ee thee with all my heart.</Q> So &s;aying, he opened the coach-door, and helped her to di&s;mount; but, when he ob&s;erved her face, he &s;tarted back, &s;aying, "Z&mdash;ds! who have we got here?" The bailiff, alarmed at this interrogation, cried with &s;ome emotion, <Q>Who the devil &s;hould it be but the pri&s;oner Eli&s;abeth Cary?</Q> The turnkey replied, <Q>That Eli&s;abeth Cary!&mdash;I'll be damn'd if that's Eli&s;abeth Cary more than my grand|mother.&mdash;D&mdash;n my blood, I know Bett Cary as well as if I had made her.</Q> Here the lady thought fit to interpo&s;e, and tell the catchpole, if he had taken her word for it at fir&s;t, he might have &s;aved him&s;elf and her a great deal of trouble.&mdash;"It may be &s;o," an&s;wered he; <Q>but by G&mdash;d, I'll have farther evidence that you are not the per&s;on before you and I part.</Q>&mdash;"Yes, yes," &s;aid &s;he, "you &s;hall have farther evidence to your co&s;t." Then we adjourned into the lodge and called for a bottle of wine, where my companion wrote a direction to two of her ac|quaintance, and begged the favour of me to go to their lodgings, and reque&s;t them to come to her immediately: I found them together at a hou&s;e in Bridges-&s;treet, Drury|lane; and, as they were luckily unengaged, they &s;et out with me in a hackney-coach without he&s;itation, after I had related to them the circum&s;tances of the affair, which flattered them with hopes of &s;eeing a bailiff troun|ced; for there is an antipathy as natural between the whores and bailiffs as that &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between mice and cats. Accordingly, when they entered the lodge, they embraced the pri&s;oner very affectionately by the name of Nancy Williams, and a&s;ked how long &s;he had been nabbed, and for what? On hearing the particulars of her adventure repeated, they offered to &s;wear before a ju&s;tice of peace,
<PB N="143" REF="027715_0150_0FD5EC914D199B70">
that &s;he was not the per&s;on mentioned in the writ, whom, it &s;eems, they all knew; but the bailiff, who by this time was convinced of his mi&s;take, told them he would not put them to that trouble.&mdash;"Ladies," &s;aid he, <Q>there's no harm done&mdash;you &s;hall give me leave to treat you with another bottle, and then we'll part friends.</Q> This pro|po&s;al was not at all reli&s;hed by the &s;i&s;terhood, and Mi&s;s Williams told him, <Q>Sure he did not imagine her &s;uch a fool as to be &s;atisfied with a paultry gla&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our wine.</Q>&mdash;Here the turnkey interrupted her, by affirming with an oat! that the wine was as good as ever was tipped over tongue.&mdash;"Well," continued &s;he, <Q>that may be&mdash;but was it the be&s;t Champaign, it is no recompen&s;e for the damage I have &s;uffered, both in character and health, by being wrongfully dragged to jail&mdash;At this rate no innocent per&s;on is &s;afe, &s;ince an officer of ju&s;tice, out of malice, private pique, or mi&s;take, may injure and oppre&s;s the &s;ubject with impunity&mdash;but, thank Heaven, I live under the protection of laws that will not &s;uffer &s;uch in&s;ults to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed, and I know very well how to procure redre&s;s.</Q> Mr. Vulture (for that was the bailiff's name) finding he had to deal with one who would not be impo&s;ed upon, began to look very &s;ullen and per|plexed, and, leaning his forehead on his hand, entered into a deliberation with him&s;elf, which la&s;ted a few minutes, and then broke out in a volley of dreadful cur&s;es again&s;t the old b&mdash;ch our landlady (as he called her) for having mi&s;informed him. After much wrangling and &s;wearing, the matter was referred to the deci&s;ion of the turnkey, who, calling for the other bottle, mulcted the bailiff in all the liquor that had been drank, coach-hire, and a cou|ple of guineas for the u&s;e of the plaintiff. The money was immediately depo&s;ited; Mi&s;s Williams gratified the two evidences with one half, and, putting the other in her pocket, drove home with me, leaving the catchpole grum|bling over his lo&s;s, yet plea&s;ed in the main for having &s;o cheaply got clear of a bu&s;ine&s;s that might have co&s;t him ten times the &s;um, and his place to boot. This guinea was a very &s;ea&s;onable relief to us, who were reduced to great nece&s;&s;ity, &s;ix of my &s;hirts, and almo&s;t all my clothes except tho&s;e on my back, having been either pawned or &s;old for our maintenance before this happened. As we
<PB N="144" REF="027715_0151_0FD5EC92A1744CF0">
re&s;ented the behaviour of our landlady, our fir&s;t care was to provide our&s;elves with another lodging, whither we re|moved next day, with an intention to keep our&s;elves as retired as po&s;&s;ible until our cure &s;hould be completed. When we were fixed in our new habitation, I entreated her to fini&s;h the &s;tory of her life, which &s;he pur&s;ued in this manner:</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of our experiment on the j&mdash;ge encouraged us to practi&s;e the &s;ame deceit on others, and my virginity was five times &s;old to good purpo&s;e; but this harve&s;t la&s;ted not long, my character taking air, and my directre&s;s de|&s;erting me for &s;ome new game. Then I took lodgings near Charing-cro&s;s at two guineas <HI>per</HI> week, and began to entertain company in a public manner: but, my income being too &s;mall to defray my expence, I was obliged to retrench, and enter into articles with the porters of cer|tain taverns, who undertook to find employment enough for me, provided I would &s;hare my profits with them.&mdash;Accordingly I was almo&s;t every night engaged with com|pany, among whom I was expo&s;ed to every mortification, danger, and abu&s;e, that flow from drunkenne&s;s, brutality, and di&s;ea&s;e. How mi&s;erable is the condition of a courte|zan, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;ooth, &s;uffer, and obey the dic|tates of rage, in&s;olence, and lu&s;t! As my &s;pirit was not &s;ufficiently humbled to the will, nor my temper calculated for the conver&s;ation of my gallants, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to overcome an aver&s;ion I felt for my profe&s;&s;ion, which manife&s;ted it&s;elf in a &s;ettled gloom on my countenance, and di&s;gu&s;ted tho&s;e &s;ons of mirth and riot &s;o much, that I was frequently u&s;ed in a &s;hocking man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er, and kicked down &s;tairs with di&s;grace. The me&s;&s;engers, &s;eeing me di&s;agreeable to their benefactors and employers, &s;eldom troubled me with a call, and I began to find my&s;elf almo&s;t totally neglected. To contribute towards my &s;upport, I was fain to &s;ell my watch, rings, trinkets, with the be&s;t part of my clothes; and I was one evening mu&s;ing by my|&s;elf on the mi&s;ery before me, when I received a me&s;&s;age from a bagnio, whither I repaired in a chair, and was in|troduced to a gentleman dre&s;&s;ed like an officer, with whom I &s;upped in a &s;umptuous manner, and, after drinking a hearty gla&s;s of Champaign, went to bed. In the morning, when I awoke, I found my gallant had got up, and, draw|ing
<PB N="145" REF="027715_0152_0FD5EC942C90CC58">
a&s;ide the curtain, could not perceive him in the room. This circum&s;tance gave me &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s; but, as he might have retired on &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion, I waited a full hour for his return, and then in the greate&s;t perplexity ro&s;e up, and rung the bell. When the waiter came to the door, he found it locked, and de&s;ired admittance, which I granted, after ob&s;erving with great &s;urpri&s;e, that the key remained on the in&s;ide, as when we went to bed. I no &s;ooner inquired for the captain, than the fellow, &s;taring with a di&s;tracted look, cried, <Q>How, Madam! is he not a-bed?</Q> and, when he was &s;atisfied as to that particu|lar, ran into a clo&s;et adjoining to the chamber, the win|dow of which he found open. Through this the adven|turer had got upon a wall, from whence he had dropped down into a court, and e&s;caped, leaving me to be an&s;wer|able not only for the reckoning, but al&s;o for a large &s;ilver tankard and po&s;&s;et-bowl, which he had carried off with him. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the con&s;ternation I was under, when I &s;aw my&s;elf detained as a thief's accomplice; for I was looked upon in that light, and carried before a ju&s;tice, who, mi&s;taking my confu&s;ion for a &s;ign of guilt, committed me, after a &s;hort examination, to Bridewell, having advi&s;ed me, as the only means to &s;ave my life, to turn evidence, and impeach my confederate. I now con|cluded the vengeance of Heaven had overtaken me, and that I mu&s;t &s;oon fini&s;h my career by an ignominious death. This reflection &s;unk &s;o deep into my &s;oul, that I was for &s;ome days deprived of my rea&s;on, and actually believed my&s;elf in hell tormented by fiends. Indeed, there needs not a very extravagant imagination to form that idea; for, of all the &s;cenes on earth, that of Bridewell approaches neare&s;t the notion I had always entertained of the infernal regions. Here I &s;aw nothing but rage, angui&s;h, and im|piety, and heard nothing but groans, cur&s;es, and bla&s;phe|my. In the mid&s;t of this helli&s;h crew I was &s;ubjected to the tyranny of a barbarian, who impo&s;ed upon me ta&s;ks that I could not po&s;&s;ibly perform, and then puni&s;hed my incapacity with the utmo&s;t rigour and inhumanity. I was often whipped into a &s;woon, and la&s;hed out of it, during which mi&s;erable intervals I was robbed by my fellow-pri|&s;oners of every thing about me, even to my cap, &s;hoes, and &s;tockings; I was not only de&s;titute of nece&s;&s;aries but

even of food, &s;o that my wretchedne&s;s was extreme. Not one of my acquaintance to whom I imparted my &s;ituation, would grant me the lea&s;t &s;uccour or regard, on pretence of my being committed for theft, and my landlord refu&s;ed to part with &s;ome of my own clothes which I had &s;ent for, becau&s;e I was indebted to him for a week's lodging.&mdash;Over|whelmed with calamity, I grew de&s;perate, and re&s;olved to put an end to my grievances and life together: for this purpo&s;e I got up in the middle of the night, when I thought every body round me a&s;leep, and fixing one end of my handkerchief to a large hook in the ceiling, that &s;upported the &s;cales on which the hemp is weighed, I &s;tood upon a chair, and, making a noo&s;e on the other end, put my neck into it, with an intention to hang my&s;elf; but, before I could adju&s;t the knot, I was &s;urpri&s;ed and pre|vented by two women who had been awake all the while, and &s;u&s;pected my de&s;ign. In the morning my attempt was publi&s;hed among the pri&s;oners, and puni&s;hed with thirty &s;tripes, the pain of which, co-operating with my di&s;ap|pointment and di&s;grace, bereft me of my &s;en&s;es, and threw me into an ec&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;y of madne&s;s, during which I tore my fle&s;h from my bones with my teeth, and da&s;hed my head again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he pavement&mdash;&s;o that they were obliged to &s;et a watch over me, to re&s;train me from doing farther mi&s;chief to my&s;elf and others. This fit of phrenzy continued three days, at the end of which I grew calm and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ullen; but, as the de&s;ire of making away with my&s;elf &s;till remained, I came to a determination of &s;tarving my&s;elf to death, and with that view refu&s;ed all &s;u&s;tenance. Whether it was owing to the want of oppo&s;ition, or to the weakne&s;s of nature, I know not, but on the &s;econd day of my fa&s;t I found my re&s;olution con&s;iderably impaired, and the calls of hunger almo&s;t in&s;upportable. At this critical conjunc|ture a lady was brought into the pri&s;on, with whom I had contracted an acquaintance while I lived with Horatio; &s;he was then on the &s;ame footing as I was, but afterwards quarrelling with her gallant, and not finding another to her mind, altered her &s;cheme of life, and &s;et up a coffee-hou&s;e among the hundreds of Drury, where &s;he entertain|ed the gentlemen with claret, arrack, and the choice of half a dozen dam&s;els, who lived in her hou&s;e.

She had not been long there before &s;he learned by di&s;a&s;ter, and coming up to me, after a compliment of condolence, in|quired into the particulars of my fate: while we were en|gaged in di&s;cour&s;e together, the ma&s;ter came and told me, that the fellow on who&s;e account I had &s;uffered was taken; that he had confe&s;&s;ed the theft, and cleared me of any concern in the affair; for which rea&s;on he the ma&s;ter had orders to di&s;charge me, and that I was from that moment free. This piece of news &s;oon bani&s;hed all thoughts of death, and had &s;uch an in&s;tantaneous effect on my coun|tenance, that Mrs. Coupler (the lady then pre&s;ent) hoping to find her account in me, very generou&s;ly offered to fur|ni&s;h me with what nece&s;&s;aries I wanted, and take me into her own hou&s;e, as &s;oon as &s;he could compromi&s;e matters with the ju&mdash;ce. The conditions of her offer were, that I &s;hould pay three guineas weekly for my board, and a rea&s;onable con&s;ideration be&s;ides for the u&s;e of &s;uch clothes and ornaments as &s;he &s;hould &s;upply me with, to be deduct|ed from the fir&s;t profits of my embraces. The&s;e were hard terms, but not to be rejected by one who was turned out helple&s;s and naked into the wide world, without a friend to pity or a&s;&s;i&s;t her. I therefore embraced her propo&s;al, and &s;he being bailed in a few hours, took me home with her in a coach. As I was by this time con&s;cious of having formerly di&s;gu&s;ted my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by my re&s;erved and haugh|ty behaviour, I now endeavoured to conquer that di&s;po&s;i|tion, and the &s;udden change of my fortune giving me a flow of &s;pirits, I appeared in the mo&s;t winning and gay man|ner I could a&s;&s;ume. Having the advantage of a good voice and education, I exerted my talents to the utter|mo&s;t, and &s;oon became the favourite with all company. This &s;ucce&s;s alarmed the pride and jealou&s;y of Mrs. Cou|pler, who could not bear the thoughts of being eclip&s;ed: &s;he therefore made a merit of her envy, and whi&s;pered among her cu&s;tomers that I was un&s;ound. There needed no more to ruin my reputation, and bla&s;t my pro&s;perity; every body &s;hunned me with marks of aver&s;ion and di&s;|dain, and in a very &s;hort time I was as &s;olitary as ever.

my malicious landlady, who, having purpo&s;ely given me credit to the amount of eleven pounds, took out a writ again&s;t me, and I was arre&s;ted in her own hou&s;e.

However, as &s;oon as I had recollected my&s;elf, I begged the favour of him to go with me to the next tavern, where I explained the nature of my di&s;a&s;ter, and convinced him of the fal&s;hood of what was reported to my prejudice &s;o effectually, that he from that moment attached him&s;elf to me, and we lived in great harmony together, until he was obliged to go to &s;ea, where he peri&s;hed in a &s;torm.</P>

When I found my&s;elf detected and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or&s;aken by you, I was fain to move my lodgings, and dwell two pair of &s;tairs higher than before.

While we were thus engaged, he re|counted a great many exploits of my uncle, who (I found) was very much beloved by the &s;hip's company, and pitied for the misfortune that happened to him in Hi&s;paniola, which I was very glad to be informed was not &s;o great as I imagined; for Captain Oakhum had recovered of his wounds, and actually at that time commanded the &s;hip. Having by accident in my pocket my uncle's letter writ|ten from Port Louis, I gave it my benefactor (who&s;e name was Jack Rattlin) for his peru&s;al; but hone&s;t Jack told me frankly he could not read, and de&s;ired to know the contents, which I immediately communicated: when he heard that part of it, in which, he &s;ays, he had writ to his landlord, in Deal; he cried, <Q>Body o'me! that was old Ben. Block&mdash;he was dead before the letter came to hand.&mdash;Ey, ey, had Ben. been alive, Lieute|nant Bowling would have had no occa&s;ion to &s;kulk &s;o long.&mdash;Hone&s;t Ben. was the fir&s;t man that taught him to hand, reef and &s;teer.&mdash;Well, well, we mu&s;t all die, that's certain&mdash;we mu&s;t all come to port &s;ooner or lat|er&mdash;at &s;ea or on &s;hore;&mdash;we mu&s;t be fa&s;t moored one

day&mdash;death's like the be&s;t bower anchor, as the &s;aying is, it will bring us all up.</Q>&mdash;I could not but &s;ignify my approbation of the ju&s;tne&s;s of Jack's reflections; and inquired into the occa&s;ion of the quarrel between Captain Oakhum and my uncle, which he explained in this man|ner.&mdash;<Q>Captain Oakhum, to be &s;ure, is a good man enough&mdash;be&s;ides, he's my commander;&mdash;but what's that to me?&mdash;I do my duty, and value no man's an|ger of a rope's end.&mdash;Now the report goes, as how he's a lord's, or baron knight's brother, whereby (dy'e &s;ee me) he carries a &s;trait arm, and keeps aloof from his officers, thof, may hap, they may be as good men in the main as he. Now we lying at anchor in Tube|roon bay, Lieutenant Bowling had the middle watch, and as he always kept a good look-out, he made (dy'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ee) three lights in the offing, whereby he ran down to the great cabin for orders, and found the captain a&s;leep;&mdash;whereupon he waked him; which put him in a main high pa&s;&s;ion, and he &s;wore woundily at the lieutenant, and called him a lou&s;y Scotch for of a whore, (for I being then centinel in the &s;teerage, heard all,) and &s;wab and lubber, whereby the lieutenant re|turned the &s;alute, and they jawed together fore and aft a good &s;pell, till at la&s;t the captain turned out, and laying hold of a rattan, came athwart Mr. Bowling's quarter; whereby he told the captain, that, if he was not his commander, he would heave him over-board, and demanded &s;atisfaction a-&s;hore; whereby, in the morn|ing watch, the captain went a-&s;hore in the pinnace, afterwards the lieutenant carried the cutter a-&s;hore, and &s;o they, leaving their boats crews on their oars, went away together; and &s;o (d'ye &s;ee) in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour we heard firing, whereby we made for the place, and found the captain lying wounded on the beach, and &s;o brought him on board to the doctor, who cured him in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks. But the lieu|tenant clapt on all the &s;ail he could bear, and had got far enough a-head before we knew any thing of the matter; &s;o that we could never after get &s;ight of him; for which we were not &s;orry, becau&s;e the captain was mainly wroth, and would certainly have done him a mi&s;chief;&mdash;for he afterwards cau&s;ed him to be run on

<P>This account of the captain's behaviour gave me no advantageous idea of his character; and I could not help lamenting my own fate, that had &s;ubjected me to &s;uch a commander. However, making a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, I put a good face on the matter, and next day was with the other pre&s;&s;ed men put on board of the Thunder lying at the Nore.&mdash;When we came along-&s;ide, the mate who guarded us thither, ordered my hand-cuffs to be taken off, that I might get on board the ea&s;ier; this circum&s;tance being perceived by &s;ome of the company who &s;tood upon the gang-boards to &s;ee us enter, one of them called to Jack Rattlin, who was bu&s;ied in doing this friendly office for me: <Q>Hey Jack, what Newgate galley have you boarded in the river as you came along? Have we not thieves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">now among us already?</Q> Another ob&s;erving my wounds, which remained expo&s;ed to the air, told me, my &s;eams were uncaulked, and that I mu&s;t be new payed.&mdash;A third &s;eeing my hair clotted together with blood, as it were into di&s;tinct cords, took notice, that my bows were manned with the red ropes, in&s;tead of my &s;ide.&mdash;A fourth a&s;ked me, if I could not keep my yards &s;quare without iron braces? And in &s;hort, a thou&s;and wittici&s;ms of the &s;ame nature were pa&s;&s;ed upon me before I could get up the &s;hip's &s;ide.&mdash;After we had been all entered upon the &s;hip's books, I inquired of one of my &s;hip|mates where the &s;urgeon was, that I might have my wounds dre&s;&s;ed, and had actually got as far as the mid|dle&punc;deck, (for our &s;hip carried eighty guns,) in my way to the cock-pit, when I was met by the &s;ame mid&s;hip|man, who had u&s;ed me &s;o barbarou&s;ly in the tender: he &s;eeing me free from my chains, a&s;ked with an in&s;olent air, who had relea&s;ed me? To this que&s;tion I fooli&s;hly an|&s;wered with a countenance that too plainly declared the &s;tate of my thoughts; <Q>Whoever did it, I am per&s;uad|ed did not con&s;ult you in the affair.</Q>&mdash;I had no &s;oon|er uttered the words, than he cried, <Q>Damn you, you &s;aucy &s;on of a bitch, I'll teach you to talk &s;o to your officer.</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying, he be&s;towed on me &s;everal &s;tripes, with a &s;upple Jack he had in his hand; and going to the commanding officer, made &s;uch a report of me, that I

was immediately put in irons by the ma&s;ter at arms, and a centinel placed over me.&mdash;Hone&s;t Rattlin, as &s;oon as he heard of my condition, came to me, and admini&s;tered all the con&s;olation he could, and then went to the &s;urgeon in my behalf, who &s;ent one of his mates to dre&s;s my wounds. This mate was no other than my old friend Thom&s;on, with whom I became acquainted at the navy|office as before-mentioned. If I knew him at fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, it was not ea&s;y for him to recognize me, disfigured with blood and dirt, and altered by the mi&s;ery I had under|gone.&mdash;Unknown as I was to him, he &s;urveyed me with looks of compa&s;&s;ion, and handled my &s;ores with great ten|derne&s;s. When he had applied what he thought proper, and was about to leave me, I a&s;ked him if my misfortunes had di&s;gui&s;ed me &s;o much, that he could not recollect my face? Upon this addre&s;s he ob&s;erved me with great ear|ne&s;tne&s;s for &s;ome time, and at length prote&s;ted he could not recollect one feature of my countenance.&mdash;To keep him no longer in &s;u&s;pence, I told him my name; which, when he had heard, he embraced me with affection, and profe&s;&s;ed his &s;orrow in &s;eeing me in &s;uch a di&s;agreeable &s;ituation. I made him acquainted with my &s;tory, and when he had heard how inhumanly I had been u&s;ed in the tender, he left me abruptly, a&s;&s;uring me, I &s;hould &s;ee him again &s;oon. I had &s;carce time to wonder at his &s;udden departure, when the ma&s;ter at arms came to the place of my confinement, and bade me follow him to the quarter-deck, where I was examined by the fir&s;t lieutenant, who commanded the &s;hip in the ab&s;ence of the captain, touch|ing the treatment I had received in the tender from my friend the mid&s;hipman, who was pre&s;ent to confront me.&mdash;I recounted the particulars of his behaviour to me, not only in the tender, but &s;ince my being on board the &s;hip, part of which being proved by the evidence of Jack Rat|tlin and others, who had no great devotion for my op|pre&s;&s;or, I was di&s;charged from confinement to make way for him, who was delivered to the ma&s;ter at arms to take his turn in the bilboes.&mdash;And this was not the only &s;atis|faction I enjoyed, for I was, at the reque&s;t of the &s;ur|geon, exempted from all other duty, than that of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing his mates in making and admini&s;tering medicines to the &s;ick.&mdash;This good office I owed to the friend&s;hip of

Mr. Thom&s;on, who had repre&s;ented me in &s;uch a favour|able light to the &s;urgeon, that he demanded me of the lieutenant to &s;upply the place of his third mate, who was lately dead.&mdash;When I had obtained this favour, my friend Thom&s;on carried me down to the cock-pit, which is the place allotted for the habitation of the &s;urgeons mates: and when he had &s;hewn me their birth, (as he called it,) I was filled with a&s;toni&s;hment and horror.&mdash;We de&s;cend|ed by divers ladders to a &s;pace as dark as a dungeon, which I under&s;tood was immer&s;ed &s;everal feet under water, being immediately above the hold: I had no &s;ooner approached this di&s;mal gulf, than my no&s;e was &s;aluted with an intolerable &s;tench of putrified chee&s;e and rancid butter, that i&s;&s;ued from an apartment at the foot of the ladder, re&s;embling a chandler's &s;hop, where, by the faint glimmering of a candle, I could perceive a man with a pale meagre countenance, &s;itting behind a kind of de&s;k, having &s;pectacles on his no&s;e, and a pen in his hand.&mdash;This (I learned of Mr. Thom&s;on) was the &s;hip's &s;teward, who &s;at there to di&s;tribute provi&s;ion to the me&s;&s;es, and to mark what each received.&mdash;He therefore pre&s;ented my name to him, and de&s;ired I might be entered in his me&s;s; then taking a light in his hand, conducted me to the place of his re&s;idence, which was a &s;quare of about &s;ix feet, &s;urrounded with the medicine che&s;t, that of the fir&s;t mate, his own, and a board by way of table fa&s;tened to the after-powder-room; it was al&s;o inclo&s;ed with canvas nailed round to the beams of the &s;hip, to &s;creen us from the cold, as well as from the view of the mid&s;hipmen and quarter-ma&s;ters, who lodged within the cable tiers on each &s;ide of us: in this gloomy man&s;ion, he entertained me with &s;ome cold &s;alt pork, which he brought from a &s;ort of locker, fixed above the table; and calling for the boy of the me&s;s, &s;ent him for a can of beer, of which he made excellent flip to crown the banquet.&mdash;By this time I began to recover my &s;pirits, which had been exceed|ingly depre&s;&s;ed with the appearance of every thing about me, and could no longer refrain from a&s;king the particu|lars of Mr. Thom&s;on's fortune, &s;ince I had &s;een him in London.&mdash;He told me, that being di&s;appointed in his ex|pectations of borrowing money to gratify the rapacious &s;&mdash;t&mdash;y at the navy-office, he found him&s;elf utterly

<P>The behaviour of Mr. Morgan&mdash;his pride, di&s;plea&s;ure and genero&s;ity&mdash;the economy of our me&s;s de&s;cribed&mdash;Thom|&s;on's further friend&s;hip&mdash;the nature of my duty explained&mdash;the &s;ituation of the &s;ick.</P>

<P>WHILE he was thus di&s;cour&s;ing to me, we heard a voice on the cockpit-ladder, pronounce with great vehemence, in a &s;trange dialect, <Q>The devil and his dam blow me from the top of Mounchdenny, if I go to him before there is &s;omething in my pelly;&mdash;let his no&s;e be as yellow as &s;affron, or as blue as a bell, (look you,) or as green as a leek, 'tis all one.</Q>&mdash;To this de|claration &s;omebody an&s;wered, <Q>So it &s;eems my poor me&s;s|mate mu&s;t part his cable for want of a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;His fore-top-&s;ail is loo&s;e already: and be&s;ides, the doctor ordered you to overhaul him;&mdash;but I &s;ee you don't care what your ma&s;ter &s;ays.</Q>&mdash;Here he was in|terrupted with <Q>Splutter and oons! you lou&s;y tog, who do you call my ma&s;ter? get you gone to the doctor, and tell him my birth, and education, and my abili|ties; and moreover, my behaviour is as good as his or any &s;hentleman's (no di&s;paragement to him) in the whole world&mdash;Got ple&s;s my &s;oul! does he think or conceive, or imagine, that I am a hor&s;e, or an a&s;s, or a goat, to trudge backwards and forwards, and up|wards and downwards, and by &s;ea, and by land, at his will and plea&s;ures?&mdash;Go your ways you rap&s;callion, and tell Doctor Atkins, that I de&s;ire and reque&s;t, that he will give a look upon the tying man, and order &s;ome|thing for him if he be dead or alive, and I will &s;ee him take it by and by, when my craving &s;tomach is &s;atis|fied, look you.</Q>&mdash;At this the other went away, &s;ay|ing, that if they would &s;erve him &s;o, when he was dying,

by God, he would be &s;oul of them in the other world.&mdash;Here Mr. Thom&s;on let me know that the per&s;on we heard was Mr. Morgan, the fir&s;t mate, who was ju&s;t come on board from the ho&s;pital, whither he had attended &s;ome of the &s;ick in the morning.&mdash;At the &s;ame time I &s;aw him come into the birth.&mdash;He was a &s;hort thick man with a face garni&s;hed with pimples, a &s;nub no&s;e turned up at the end, an exce&s;&s;ive wide mouth, and little fiery eyes, &s;ur|rounded with &s;kin puckered up in innumerable wrinkles.&mdash;My friend immediately made him acquainted with my ca&s;e; when he regarded me with a very lofty look, but without &s;peaking, &s;et down a bundle he had in his hand, and approached the cupboard, which when he had open|ed, he exclaimed in a great pa&s;&s;ion, <Q>Cot is my life! all the pork is gone, as I am a Chri&s;tian!</Q> Thom&s;on then gave him to under&s;tand, that as I had been brought on board half-fami&s;hed be could do no le&s;s than entertain me with what was in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ocker; and the rather as he had bid the &s;teward enter me the me&s;s.&mdash;Whether this di&s;|appointment made Mr. Morgan more peevi&s;h than u&s;ual, or he really thought him&s;elf too little regarded by his fel|low-mate, I know not, but after &s;ome pau&s;e he went on in this manner.&mdash;<Q>Mr. Thom&s;on, perhaps you do not u&s;e me with all the good manners, and complai&s;ance, and re&s;pect (look you) that becomes you, becau&s;e you have not vouch&s;afed to advi&s;e with me in this affair.&mdash;I have, in my time, (look you,) been a man of &s;ome weight and &s;ub&s;tance, and con&s;ideration, and have kept hou&s;e and home, and paid &s;cot and lot and the king's taxes; ay, and maintained a family to boot.&mdash;And moreover, al&s;o, I am your &s;enior, and your elder, and your petter, Mr. Thoms&s;on.</Q>&mdash;<Q>My elder I'll al|low you to be, but not my better,</Q> cried Thom&s;on with &s;ome heat. "Cot is my &s;aviour, and witne&s;s too," &s;aid Morgan, with great vehemence, <Q>that I am more elder and therefore more petter by many years than you.</Q>&mdash;Fearing this di&s;pute might be attended with &s;ome bad con&s;equence, I interpo&s;ed, and told Mr. Mor|gan, I was very &s;orry for having been the occa&s;ion of any difference between him and the &s;econd mate; and that, rather than cau&s;e the lea&s;t breach in their good under|&s;tanding, I would eat my allowance by my&s;elf, or &s;eek

admi&s;&s;ion into &s;ome other company.&mdash;But Thom&s;on, with more &s;pirit than di&s;cretion, (as I thought,) in&s;i&s;ted upon my remaining where he had appointed me; and ob&s;erved that no man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of genero&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion, would have any objection to it, con&s;idering my birth and talents, and the misfortunes I had of late &s;o unju&s;tly undergone.&mdash;This was touching Mr. Morgan on the right key, who pro|te&s;ted with great earne&s;tne&s;s, that he had no objection to my being received in the me&s;s; but only complained, that the ceremony of a&s;king his con&s;ent was not ob&s;erved. <Q>As for a &s;hentleman in di&s;tre&s;s,</Q> &s;aid he, &s;haking me by the hand, <Q>I lofe him as I lofe my own powels: for Got help me! I have had vexation enough upon my own pack.</Q>&mdash;And I afterwards learned, in &s;o &s;aying, he &s;poke no more than what was true; for he had been once &s;ettled in a very good &s;ituation in Glamorgan&s;hire, and was ruined by being &s;ecurity for an acquaintance. All differences being compo&s;ed, he untied his bundle, which con&s;i&s;ted of three bunches of onions, and a great lump of Che&s;hire chee&s;e wrapped up in a handkerchief, and, taking &s;ome bi&s;cuit from the cupboard, fell to with a keen appetite, inviting us to a &s;hare of the repa&s;t. When he had fed heartily on his homely fare, he filled a large cup, made of a cocoa|nut &s;hell, with brandy, and, drinking it off, told us&punc; "Prandy was the pe&s;t men&s;truum for onion and &s;hee&s;e." His hunger being appea&s;ed, he began to be in better hu|mour, and, being inqui&s;itive about my birth, no &s;ooner under&s;tood that I was de&s;cended of a good family than he di&s;covered a particular good-will to me on that account, deducing his own pedigree in a direct line from the famous Caractacus king of the Britons, who was fir&s;t the pri&s;oner, and afterwards the friend of Claudius Cae&s;ar. Perceiving how much I was reduced in point of linen, he made me a pre&s;ent of two ruffled &s;hirts, which, with two more of check which I received from Mr. Thom&s;on, enabled me to appear with decency. Mean while the &s;ailor, whom Mr. Morgan had &s;ent to the doctor, brought a pre&s;crip|tion for his me&s;s-mate, which, when the Welchman had read, he got up to prepare it, and a&s;ked if the man was <Q>dead or alive.</Q> "Dead!" replied Jack; <Q>if he was dead, he would have no need of doctor's &s;tuff&mdash;No, thank God, death han't as yet boarded him, but they have

Morgan, hearing this, exclaimed, <Q>Mercy upon my &s;alvation! why did you not &s;top him till I came?</Q>&mdash;"Stop him," &s;aid the other; <Q>I hail'd him &s;everal times, but he was too far on his way, while the enemy had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his clo&s;e quarters; &s;o that he did not mind me.</Q>&mdash;"Well, well," &s;aid he, <Q>we all owe Heaven a teath.&mdash;Go your ways, you ragamuffin, and take an example and a warning; look you, and repent of your mi&s;teets.</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying, he pu&s;hed the &s;eaman out of the birth.</P>
<P>While he entertained us with reflections &s;uitable to this event, we heard the boat&s;wain pipe to dinner; and imme|diately the boy belonging to our me&s;s ran to the locker, from whence he carried off a large wooden platter, and in a few minutes returned with it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ull of boiling pea&s;e, cry|ing, "Scaldings," all the way as he came. The cloth, con&s;i&s;ting of a piece of an old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ail, was in&s;tantly laid, co|vered with three plates, which by the colour I could with difficulty di&s;cern to be metal, and as many &s;poons of the &s;ame compo&s;ition, two of which were curtailed in the han|dles, and the other abridged in the lip. Mr. Morgan him&s;elf enriched this me&s;s with a lump of &s;alt butter, &s;cooped from an old gallipot, and a handful of onions &s;horn, with &s;ome pounded pepper. I was not very much tempted with the appearance of this di&s;h, of which, ne|verthele&s;s, my me&s;s-mates eat heartily, advi&s;ing me to fol|low their example, as it was banyan-day, and we could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no meat till next noon.

&s;ufficient for the occa&s;ion, and therefore de&s;ired to be ex|cu&s;ed, expre&s;&s;ing a curio&s;ity to know the meaning of ban|yan-day&mdash;They told me, that on Mondays, Wedne&s;days, and Fridays, the &s;hip's company had no allowance of meat, and that the&s;e meagre days were called banyan-days, the rea&s;on of which they did not know; but I have &s;ince learn|ed, they take their denomination from a &s;ect of devotees in &s;ome parts of the Ea&s;t-Indies, who never ta&s;te fle&s;h.</P>
<P>After dinner Thom&s;on led me round the &s;hip, &s;hewed me the different parts, de&s;cribed their u&s;es, and, as far as he could, made me acquainted with the particulars of the di&s;cipline and economy practi&s;ed on board. He then de|manded of the boat&s;wain an hammock for me, which was &s;lung in a very neat manner by my friend Jack Rattlin, and, as I had no bed-clothes, procured credit for me with the pur&s;er for a mattra&s;s and two blankets. At &s;even o'clock in the evening Morgan vi&s;ited the &s;ick, and, having ordered what was proper for each, I a&s;&s;i&s;ted Thom&s;on in making up his pre&s;criptions; but when I followed him with the medicines into the &s;ick-birth or ho&s;pital, and, ob|&s;erved the &s;ituation of the patients, I was much le&s;s &s;ur|pri&s;ed that people &s;hould die on board, than that any &s;ick per&s;on &s;hould recover. Here I &s;aw about fifty mi&s;erable di&s;tempered wretches, &s;u&s;pended in rows, &s;o huddled one upon another, that not more than fourteen inches &s;pace was allotted for each with his bed and bedding; and de|prived of the light of the day as well as of fre&s;h air; breathing nothing but a noi&s;ome atmo&s;phere of the mor|bid &s;teams exhaling from their own excrements and di&s;ea|&s;ed bodies, devoured with vermin hatched in the filth that &s;urrounded them, and de&s;titute of every convenience ne|ce&s;&s;ary for people in that helple&s;s condition.</P>

<P>A di&s;agreeable accident happens to me in the di&s;charge of my office&mdash;Morgan's no&s;e is offended&mdash;a dialogue between him and the &s;hip's &s;teward&mdash;upon examination I find more cau&s;es of complaint than one&mdash;my hair is cut off&mdash;Mor|gan's cookery&mdash;the manner of &s;leeping on board&mdash;I am awaked in the night by a dreadful noi&s;e</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I COULD not comprehend how it was po&s;&s;ible for the at|tendants to come near tho&s;e who hung on the in&s;ide towards the &s;ides of the &s;hip, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, as they &s;eemed barricadoed by tho&s;e who lay on the out&s;ide, and entirely out of the reach of all vi&s;itation&mdash;much le&s;s could I conceive how my friend Thom&s;on would be able to admini&s;ter cly&s;ters, that were ordered for &s;ome in that &s;ituation&mdash;when I &s;aw him thru&s;t his wig in his pocket, and &s;trip him&s;elf to his wai&s;tcoat in a moment, then creep on all fours under the hammocks of the &s;ick, and, forcing up his bare pate between two, keep them a&s;under with one &s;houlder, until he had done his duty. Eager to learn the &s;ervice, I de&s;ired he would give me leave to perform the next operation of that kind; and, he con&s;enting, I undre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf after his example, and, crawling along, the &s;hip happened to roll; this motion alarming me, I laid hold of the fir&s;t thing that came within my gra&s;p with &s;uch violence, that I overturned it, and &s;oon found by the &s;mell that i&s;&s;ued upon me, I had not unlocked a box of the mo&s;t delicious perfume; it was well for me that my no&s;e was none of the mo&s;t delicate, el&s;e I know not how I might have been affected by this vapour, which diffu&s;ed it&s;elf all over the &s;hip to the utter di&s;compo&s;ure of every body who tarried on the &s;ame deck&mdash;neither was the con&s;equence of this di&s;grace confined to my &s;en&s;e of &s;melling only; for I felt my misfortunes more ways than one. That I might not, however, appear altogether di&s;concerted in this my fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, I got up, and pu&s;hing my head with great force, between two hammocks, towards the middle, where the greate&s;t re&s;i&s;tance was, I made an opening indeed, but, not under&s;tanding the knack of dexterou&s;ly turning my &s;houlder to maintain my advantage, had the mortification to find my&s;elf &s;tuck up as it were in a pillory, and the

weight of three of four people bearing on each &s;ide of my neck; &s;o that I was in danger of &s;trangulation. While I remained in this defencele&s;s po&s;ture, one of the &s;ick men, rendered peevi&s;h by his di&s;temper, was &s;o enraged at the &s;mell I had occa&s;ioned, and the rude &s;hock he had recei|ved from me in my elevation, that, with many bitter re|proaches, he &s;eized me by the no&s;e, which he tweaked &s;o unmercifully that I roared with angui&s;h. Thom&s;on, per|ceiving my condition, ordered one of the waiters to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who with much difficulty di&s;engaged me from this &s;ituation, and hindered me from taking vengeance on the &s;ick man, who&s;e indi&s;po&s;ition would not have &s;creened him from the effects of my indignation.</P>
<P>After having made an end of our mini&s;try for that time, we de&s;cended to the cockpit, my friend comforting me for what had happened with a homely proverb, which I do not chu&s;e to repeat. When we had de&s;cended half way down the ladder, Mr. Morgan, before he &s;aw us, having intelligence by his no&s;e of the approach of &s;omething ex|traordinary, cried, <Q>Cot have mercy upon my &s;en&s;es! I believe the enemy has poarded us in a &s;tink-pot!</Q>&mdash;Then directing his di&s;cour&s;e to the &s;teward, from whom he imagined the odour proceeded, he reprimanded him &s;everely for the freedoms he took among gentlemen of birth, and threatened to &s;moke him like a padger with &s;ulphur, if ever he &s;hould pre&s;ume to offend his neighbours with &s;uch &s;mells for the future: the &s;teward, con&s;cious of his own innocence, replied with &s;ome warmth, <Q>I know of no &s;mells but tho&s;e of your own making.</Q> This re|partee introduced a &s;mart dialogue, in which the Welch|man undertook to prove, that, though the &s;tench he com|plained of did not flow from the &s;teward's own body, he was neverthele&s;s the author of it, by &s;erving out damaged provi&s;ions to the &s;hip's company, and, in particular, pu|trified chee&s;e, from the u&s;e of which only, he affirmed, &s;uch un&s;avoury &s;teams could ari&s;e. Then he launched out into the prai&s;e of good chee&s;e, of which he gave the ana|ly&s;is, explained the different kinds of that commodity, with the methods practi&s;ed to make and pre&s;erve it, and concluded with ob&s;erving, that, in yielding good chee&s;e, the county of Glamorgan might vie with Che&s;hire it&s;elf, and was much &s;uperior to it in the produce of goats and

putter. I gathered from this conver&s;ation, that, if I en|tered in my pre&s;ent pickle, I &s;hould be no welcome gue&s;t, and therefore de&s;ired Mr. Thom&s;on to go before, and re|pre&s;ent my calamity; at which the fir&s;t mate, expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome concern, went upon deck immediately, taking his way through the cable tire, and by the main hatchway, to avoid encountering me, de&s;iring to clean my&s;elf as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; for he intended to regale him&s;elf with a di&s;h of &s;almagundy and a pipe. Accordingly I &s;et about this di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;oon found I had more cau&s;es of complaint than I at fir&s;t imagined; for I percei|ved &s;ome gue&s;ts had honoured me with their company, who&s;e vi&s;it I did not at all think &s;ea&s;onable; neither did they &s;eem inclined to leave me in a hurry; for they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my chief quarters, where they fed with|out re&s;erve at the expence of my blood. But, con&s;idering it would be much ea&s;ier to extirpate this ferocious colony in the infancy of their &s;ettlement than after they &s;hould be multiplied and naturali&s;ed to the &s;oil, I took the advice of my friend, (who, to prevent &s;uch misfortunes, went always clo&s;e &s;haved,) and made the boy of our me&s;s cut off my hair, which had been growing &s;ince I left the &s;ervice of Lavement, and the &s;econd mate lent me an old bob-wig to &s;upply the lo&s;s of that covering. This affair being end|ed, and every thing adju&s;ted in the be&s;t manner my cir|cum&s;tances would permit, the de&s;cendant of Caractaous returned, and, ordering the boy to bring a piece of &s;alt beef from the brine, cut off a &s;lice, and mixed it with an equal quantity of onions, which &s;ea&s;oning with a moderate proportion of pepper and &s;alt, he brought it into a con|&s;i&s;tence with oil and vinegar&mdash;then, ta&s;ting the di&s;h, a&s;|&s;ured us it was the be&s;t &s;almagundy that ever he made, and recommended it to our palate with &s;uch heartine&s;s, that I could not help doing honour to his preparation. But I had no &s;ooner &s;wallowed a mouthful than I thought my entrails were &s;corched, and endeavoured with a deluge of &s;mall beer to allay the heat it occa&s;ioned. Supper being over, Mr. Morgan having &s;moked a couple of pipes, and &s;up|plied the moi&s;ture he had expended with as many cans of flip, of which we all partook, a certain yawning began to admoni&s;h me, that it was high time to repair by &s;leep the injury I had &s;uffered for want of re&s;t the preceding night;

which being perceived by my companions, who&s;e time of repo&s;e was now arrived, they propo&s;ed we &s;hould turn in, or, in other words, go to bed. Our hammocks, which hung parallel to one another on the out&s;ide of the birth, were immediately unla&s;hed, and I beheld my me&s;s-mates &s;pring with great agility into their re&s;pective ne&s;ts, where they &s;eemed to lie concealed, very much at their ea&s;e.&mdash;But it was &s;ome time before I could prevail upon my&s;elf to tru&s;t my carca&s;e at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the ground, in a narrow bag, out of which I imagined I &s;hould be apt, on the lea&s;t motion in my &s;leep, to tumble down at the hazard of breaking my bones, I &s;uffered my&s;elf, however, to be per&s;uaded, and, taking a leap to get in, threw my|&s;elf quite over with &s;uch violence, that, had I not luckily got hold of Thom&s;on's hammock, I &s;hould have pitched upon my head on the other &s;ide, and in all likelihood fractured my &s;kull. After &s;ome fruitle&s;s efforts I &s;ucceeded at la&s;t; but the apprehen&s;ion of the jeopardy, in which I believed my&s;elf, with&s;tood all the attacks of &s;leep till to|wards the morning-watch, when, in &s;pite of my fears, I was overpowered with &s;lumber; though I did not long enjoy this comfortable &s;ituation, being arou&s;ed with a noi&s;e &s;o loud and &s;hrill, that I thought the drums of my ears were bur&s;t by it: this was followed by a dreadful &s;um|mons pronounced by a hoar&s;e voice, which I could not under&s;tand. While I was debating with my&s;elf whether or not I &s;hould wake my companion, and inquire into the occa&s;ion of this di&s;turbance, I was informed by one of the quarter ma&s;ters, who pa&s;&s;ed by me with a lanthorn in his hand, that the noi&s;e which alarmed me was occa&s;ioned by the boat&s;wain's mate who called up the larboard watch, and that I mu&s;t lay my account with &s;uch interruption every morning at the &s;ame hour. Being now more a&s;&s;ured of my &s;afety, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf again to re&s;t, and &s;lept till eight o'clock, when ri&s;ing, and breakfa&s;ting with my comrades on bi&s;cuit and brandy, the &s;ick were vi&s;ited and a&s;&s;i&s;ted as before; after which vi&s;itation, my good friend Thom&s;on explained and performed another piece of duty, to which I was a &s;tranger. At a certain hour in the morning the boy of the me&s;s went round all the decks, ringing a &s;mall hand-bell, and, in rhimes compo&s;ed for the occa&s;ion, invited all tho&s;e who had &s;ores to repair

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE I was bu&s;ied with my friend in this practice, the doctor chanced to pa&s;s by the place where we were, and, &s;topping to ob&s;erve me, appeared very well &s;atisfied with my method of application, and afterwards &s;ent for me to his cabin, where, having examined me touching my &s;kill in &s;urgery, and the particulars of my fortune, he intere&s;ted him&s;elf &s;o far in my behalf as to promi&s;e his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in procuring a warrant for me, &s;ee|ing I had been already found qualified at &s;urgeons-hall for the &s;tation I filled on board; and in this good office he the more cordially engaged, when he under&s;tood I was a nephew to Lieutenant Bowling, for whom he expre&s;&s;ed a particular regard. In the mean time I could learn from his di&s;cour&s;e, that he did not intend to go to &s;ea again with Captain Oakhum, having, as he thought, been in|differently u&s;ed by him during the la&s;t voyage.</P>
<P>While I lived tolerably ea&s;y, in expectation of prefer|ment, I was not altogether without mortifications, which I not only &s;uffered from the rude in&s;ults of the &s;ailors and petty officers, (among whom I was known by the name of <HI>Loblolly boy,</HI>) but al&s;o from the di&s;po&s;ition of Morgan, who, though friendly in the main, was often very trou|ble&s;ome with his pride, which expected a good deal of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from me, and delighted in recapitulating the favours I had received at his hands.</P>
<P>About &s;ix weeks after my arrival on board, the &s;urgeon, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">idding me follow him into his cabin, pre&s;ented a warrant
<PB N="171" REF="027715_0178_0FD5ECC89D665A18">
to me, by which I was appointed &s;urgeon's third mate on board the Thunder. This he had procured by his intere&s;t at the navy-office, as al&s;o another for him&s;elf, by virtue of which he was removed into a &s;econd rate. I acknow|ledged his kindne&s;s in the &s;tronge&s;t terms my gratitude could &s;ugge&s;t, and profe&s;&s;ed my &s;orrow at the pro&s;pect of lo&s;ing &s;o valuable a friend, to whom I hoped to have re|commended my&s;elf &s;till farther by my re&s;pectful and dili|gent behaviour. But his genero&s;ity re&s;ted not here; for, before he left the &s;hip, he made me a pre&s;ent of a che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t and &s;ome clothes, that enabled me to &s;upport the rank to which he had rai&s;ed me. I found my &s;pirit revive with my good fortune; and, now I was an officer, re&s;olved to maintain the dignity of my &s;tation again&s;t all oppo&s;ition or affronts; nor was it long before I had occa&s;ion to exert my re&s;olution; my old enemy, the mid&s;hipman, (who&s;e name was Crampley) entertaining an implacable animo&s;ity again&s;t me for the di&s;grace he had &s;uffered on my account, had &s;ince that time taken all opportunities of reviling and ridiculing me, when I was not entitled to retort this bad u&s;age&mdash;and even after I had been rated on the books, and mu&s;tered as &s;urgeon's mate, did not think fit to re&s;train his in&s;olence. In particular, being one day pre&s;ent, while I dre&s;&s;ed a wound in a &s;ailor's leg, he began to &s;ing a &s;ong, which I thought highly injurious to the honour of my country, and therefore &s;ignified my re&s;entment by ob|&s;erving, that the Scots always laid their account with finding enemies among the ignorant, in&s;ignificant, and malicious. This unexpected piece of a&s;&s;urance enraged him to &s;uch a degree, that he lent me a blow on the face, which I verily thought had demoli&s;hed my cheek-bone; I was not &s;low in returning the obligation, and the affair began to be very &s;erious, when by accident Mr. Mor|gan and one of the ma&s;ter's mates, coming that way, in|terpo&s;ed, and, inquiring into the cau&s;e, endeavoured to promote a reconciliation; but finding us both exa&s;perated to the uttermo&s;t, and bent again&s;t accommodation, they advi&s;ed us either to leave our difference undecided till we &s;hould have an opportunity of terminating it on &s;hore like gentlemen, or el&s;e chu&s;e a proper place on board, and bring it to an i&s;&s;ue by boxing. This la&s;t expedient was greedily embraced by both; and, being forthwith

con|ducted to the ground propo&s;ed, we &s;tripped in a moment, and began a very furious conte&s;t, in which I &s;oon found my&s;elf inferior to my antagoni&s;t, not &s;o much in &s;trength and agility as in &s;kill, which he had acquired in the &s;chool of Hockley in the Hole and Tottenham&punc;court. Many cro&s;s-buttocks did I &s;u&s;tain, and pegs on the &s;tomach without number, till at la&s;t, my breath being qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">te gone, as well as my vigour wa&s;ted, I grew de&s;perate; and, col|lecting all my &s;trength in one effort, threw in at once head, hands and feet, with &s;uch violence, that I drove my an|tagoni&s;t three paces backward into the main hatchway, down which he fell; and, pitching upon his head and right &s;houlder, remained without &s;en&s;e and motion. Morgan, looking down, and &s;eeing him lie in that condition, cried, <Q>Upon my con&s;cience, as I am a Chri&s;tian &s;inner, (look you,) I believe his pattles are all ofer; but I take you all to witne&s;s, that there was no treachery in the ca&s;e, and that he has &s;uffered by the chance of war.</Q> So &s;aying, he de&s;cended to the deck below to examine into the &s;ituation of my adver&s;ary, and left me very little plea|&s;ed with my victory, as I found my&s;elf not only terribly brui&s;ed, but likewi&s;e in danger of being called to account for the death of Crampley: but this fear vani&s;hed, when my fellow-mate, having, by bleeding him in the jugular, brought him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o him&s;elf, and inquired into the &s;tate of his body, called up to me, to be under no concern, for the mid&s;hipman had received no other damage than as pretty a luxation of the <HI>os humeri,</HI> as one would de&s;ire to &s;ee on a &s;ummer's day. Upon this information I crawled down to the cock-pit, and acquainted Thom&s;on with the affair, who providing him&s;elf with bandages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nece&s;&s;ary for the oc|ca&s;ion, went up to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mr. Morgan in the reduction of the di&s;location. When this was &s;ucce&s;sfully performed, they wi&s;hed me joy of the event of the combat, and the Welchman, after ob&s;erving, that in all likelihood the an|cient Scots and Britons were the &s;ame people, bade me <Q>prai&s;e Got for putting mettle in my pelly, and &s;trength in my limbs to &s;upport it.</Q> I acquired &s;uch reputation by this rencounter, (which la&s;ted twenty minutes,) that every body became more cautious in behaviour towards me, though Crampley, with his arm in a &s;ling, talked very high, and threatened to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity of
<PB N="173" REF="027715_0180_0FD5ECD0D98D6990">
retrieving on &s;hore the honour he had lo&s;t by an accident, from which I could ju&s;tly claim no merit.</P>
<P>About this time Captain Oakhum, having received &s;ail|ing orders, came on board, and brought along with him a &s;urgeon of his own country, who &s;oon made us &s;en&s;ible of the lo&s;s we &s;uffered in the departure of Doctor Atkins; for he was gro&s;sly ignorant, and intolerably a&s;&s;uming, fal&s;e, vindictive, and unforgiving; a mercile&s;s tyrant to his inferiors, an abject &s;ycophant to tho&s;e above him. In the morning after the captain came on board, our fir&s;t mate, according to cu&s;tom, went to wait on him with a &s;ick li&s;t, which when this grim commander had peru&s;ed, he cried with a &s;tern countenance, <Q>Blood and oons! &s;ix|ty-one &s;ick people on board of my &s;hip! Harkee, you Sir, I'll have no &s;ick people on board of my &s;hip, by G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d.</Q> The Welchman replied, he &s;hould be very glad to find no &s;ick people on board; but, while it was otherwi&s;e&punc; he did no more than his duty in pre&s;enting him with a li&s;t: "You and your li&s;t may be d&mdash;n'd," &s;aid the captain, throwing it at him; <Q>I &s;ay there &s;hall be no &s;ick in this &s;hip while I have the command of her.</Q> Mr. Morgan, being nettled at this treatment, told him, his indignation ought to be directed to Got Almighty, who vi&s;ited his people with di&s;tempers, and not to him, who contributed all in his power towards their cure. The ba&s;haw, not being u&s;ed to &s;uch behaviour in any of his officers, was enraged to fury at this &s;atirical in&s;inuation, and, &s;tamping with his foot, called him in&s;olent &s;coundrel, threatening to have him pinioned to the deck, if he &s;hould pre&s;ume to utter another &s;yllable. But the blood of Caractacus, being thoroughly heated, di&s;dained to be re&s;tricted by &s;uch a command, and began to manife&s;t it&s;elf in&mdash;<Q>Captain Oakhum, I am a &s;hentleman of birth and parentage, (look you,) and peradventure I am moreover&mdash;</Q> Here his harangue was broke off by the captain's &s;teward, who, being Morgan's countryman, hurried him out of the ca|bin before he had time to exa&s;perate his ma&s;ter to a great|er degree; and this would certainly have been the ca&s;e; for the indignant Welchman could hardly be hindered, by his friend's arguments and entreaties, from re-entering the pre&s;ence-chamber, and defying Captain Oakhum to his teeth. He was, however, appea&s;ed at length, and came down to the birth, where, finding Thom&s;on and me at

work preparing medicines, he bade us leave off our labour, and go to play; for the captain, by his &s;ole word and power, and command, had driven &s;ickne&s;s a-pegging to the tevil, and there was no more malady on board. So &s;aying, he drank off a gill of brandy, &s;ighed grievou&s;ly three times, poured forth an ejaculation of <Q>Got ble&s;s my heart, liver, and lungs!</Q> and then began to &s;ing a Welch &s;ong with great earne&s;tne&s;s of vi&s;age, voice, and ge&s;ture. I could not conceive the meaning of this &s;ingular phenomenon, and &s;aw by the looks of Thom&s;on, who at the &s;ame time &s;hook his head, that he &s;u&s;pected poor Cadwallader's brains were un&s;ettled. He, perceiving our amazement, told us he would explain the my&s;tery, but at the &s;ame time bade us take notice, that he had lived poy, patchelor, married man, and widower, almo&s;t forty years, and in all that time there was no man or mother's &s;on in the whole world, who dur&s;t u&s;e him &s;o ill as Captain Oak|hum had done. Then he acquainted us with the dialogue that pa&s;&s;ed between them, as I have already related it, and had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed this narration than he received a me&s;&s;age from the &s;urgeon to bring the &s;ick li&s;t to the quarter-deck, for the captain had ordered all the patients thither to be reviewed. This inhuman order &s;hocked us extremely, as we knew it would be impo&s;&s;ible to carry &s;ome of them on the deck, without imminent danger of their lives; but, as we likewi&s;e knew it would be to no purpo&s;e for us to remon&s;trate again&s;t it, we repaired to the quarter-deck in a body to &s;ee this extraordinary mu&s;ter; Morgan ob&s;erving by the way, that the captain was going to &s;end to the other world a great many evidences to te&s;ti|fy again&s;t him&s;elf. When we appeared upon deck, the captain bade the doctor, who &s;tood bowing at his right|hand, look at the&s;e lazy lubberly &s;ons of bitches, who were good for nothing on board but to eat the king's provi&s;ion, and encourage idlene&s;s in the &s;kulkers; the &s;urgeon grinned approbation, and, taking the li&s;t, began to examine the complaints of each as they could crawl to the place appointed. The fir&s;t who came under his cog|ni&s;ance was a poor fellow ju&s;t freed of a fever, which had weakened him &s;o much, that he could hardly &s;tand. Mr. Mac&s;hane (for that was the doctor's name) having felt his pul&s;e, prote&s;ted he was as well as any man in the world,

and the captain delivered him over to the boat&s;wain's mate, with orders that he &s;hould receive a round dozen at the gangway immediately, for counterfeiting him&s;elf &s;ick; but, before the di&s;cipline could be executed, the man dropped down on the deck, and had well nigh peri&s;hed under the hands of the execu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ioner. The next patient to be con&s;idered, laboured under a quartan ague, and, being then in the interval of health, di&s;covered no other &s;ymp|toms of his di&s;temper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a pale meagre countenance, and emaciated body; upon which he was declared fit for duty, and turned over to the boat&s;wain; but, being re&s;olved to di&s;grace the doctor, died upon the foreca&s;tle next day during his cold fit. The third complained of a pleuretic &s;titch, and &s;pitting of blood, for which Doctor Mach&s;hane pre&s;cribed exerci&s;e at the pump, to promote expectora|tion; but whether this was improper for one in his &s;itua|tion, or that it was u&s;ed to exce&s;s, I know not, but in le&s;s than half an hour he was &s;uffocated with a deluge of blood that i&s;&s;ued from his lungs. A fourth with much difficulty climbed to the quarter-deck, being loaded with a mon&s;trous a&s;cites or drop&s;y that invaded his che&s;t &s;o much, that he could &s;carce fetch his breath; but his di&s;ea&s;e being interpreted into fat, occa&s;ioned by idlene&s;s and exce&s;s of eating, he was ordered, with a view to promote per&s;piration and inlarge his che&s;t, to go aloft immediate|ly: it was in vain for this unwieldy wretch to alledge his utter incapacity; the boat&s;wain's driver was commanded to whip him up with the cat and nine tails: the &s;mart of this application made him exert him&s;elf &s;o much, that he actually arrived at the puttock-&s;hrouds; but when the enormous weight of his body had nothing el&s;e to &s;upport it than his weakened arms, either out of &s;pite or nece&s;&s;ity, he quitted his hold, and plunged into the &s;ea, where he mu&s;t have been drowned, had not a &s;ailor, who was in a boat along-&s;ide, &s;aved his life, by keeping him afloat, till he was hoi&s;ted on board by a tackle. It would be te|dious and di&s;agreeable to de&s;cribe the fate of every mi|&s;erable object that &s;uffered by the inhumanity and igno|rance of the captain and &s;urgeon, who &s;o wantonly &s;acri|ficed the lives of their fellow creatures. Many were brought up in the height of fevers, and rendered delirious by the injuries they &s;uffered by the way. Some gave up the

gho&s;t in the pre&s;ence of their in&s;pectors; and others who were ordered to their duty, langui&s;hed a few days at work, among their fellows, and then departed without any ceremony. On the whole, the number of &s;ick was reduced to le&s;s than a dozen; and the authors of this re|duction were applauding them&s;elves for the &s;ervice they had done to their king and country, when the boat&s;wain's mate informed his honour, that there was a man below la&s;hed to his hammock by the direction of the doctor's mate, and that he begged hard to be relea&s;ed; affirming, that he had been &s;o maltreated only for a grudge Mr. Morgan bore him, and that he was as much in his &s;en&s;es as any man aboard.&mdash;The captain hearing this, darted a &s;evere look at the Welchman, and ordered the man to be brought up immediately: upon which Morgan prote&s;ted with great fervency, that the per&s;on in que&s;tion was as mad as a March hare; and begged for the love of Got, they would at lea&s;t keep his arms pinioned during his ex|amination, to prevent him from doing mi&s;chief.&mdash;This re|que&s;t the commander granted for his own &s;ake, and the patient was produced, who in&s;i&s;ted on his being in his right wits, with &s;uch calmne&s;s and &s;trength of argument, that every body pre&s;ent was inclined to believe him, ex|cept Morgan, who affirmed there was no tru&s;ting to ap|pearances, for he him&s;elf had been &s;o much impo&s;ed upon by his behaviour two days before, that he had actually unbound him with his own hands, and had well nigh been murdered for his pains: this was confirmed by the evi|dence of one of the waiters, who declared, he had pulled this patient from the doctor's mate, whom he had gotten down and almo&s;t &s;trangled. To this the man an&s;wered, that the witne&s;s was a creature of Morgan's, and was &s;uborned to give his te&s;timony again&s;t him by the malice of the mate, whom the defendant had affronted, by di&s;|covering to the people on board that Mr. Morgan's wife kept a gin &s;hop in Rag-fair.&mdash;This anecdote produced a laugh at the expence of the Welchman, who, &s;haking his head with &s;ome emotion, &s;aid&mdash;<Q>Ay, ay, 'tis no matter&mdash;Got knows it is an arrant fal&s;ehood.</Q>&mdash;Captain Oakhum, without any further he&s;itation, ordered the fel|low to be unfettered; at the &s;ame time threatening to make Morgan exchange &s;ituations with him for his &s;pite;

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE captain was carried into his cabin, &s;o enraged with the treatment he had received, that he ordered the fellow to be brought before him, that he might have the plea&s;ure of pi&s;toling him with his own hand; and would certainly have &s;atisfied his revenge in this manner, had not the fir&s;t lieutenant remon&s;trated again&s;t it, by ob&s;erving, that in all appearance the fellow was not mad, but de&s;perate; that he had been hired by &s;ome enemy of the captain to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him, and therefore ought to be kept in irons till he could be brought to a court-martial, which, no doubt, would &s;ift the affair to the bottom, (by which means important di&s;coveries might be made,) and then &s;entence the criminal to a death adequate to his de|merits.&mdash;This &s;ugge&s;tion, improbable as it was, had the
<PB N="178" REF="027715_0185_0FD5ECD85BDEFE98">
de&s;ired effect upon the captain, being exactly calculated for the meridian of his intellects; more e&s;pecially, as Doc|tor Mac&s;hane e&s;pou&s;ed this opinion, in con&s;equence of his previous declaration that the man was not mad.&mdash;Morgan finding there was no more damage done, could not help di&s;covering by his countenance, the plea&s;ure he enjoyed on this occa&s;ion; and while he bathed the doctor's face with an embrocation, ventured to a&s;k him, Whether he thought there were more fools or madmen on board? But he would have been wi&s;er in containing this &s;ally, which his patient carefully laid up in his memory, to be taken notice of at a more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it &s;ea&s;on.&mdash;Meanwhile we weighed anchor, and on our way to the Downs, the madman, who was treated as a pri&s;oner, took an opportunity, while the centinel attended him at the head, to leap over-board, and fru&s;trate the revenge of the captain.&mdash;We &s;taid not long at the Downs, but took the benefit of the fir&s;t ea&s;t|erly wind to go round to Spithead; where having re|ceived on board provi&s;ions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or &s;ix months, we &s;ailed from St. Helen's, in the grand fleet bound for the We&s;t-Indies, on the ever-memorable expedition of Carthagena.</P>
<P>It was not without great mortification I &s;aw my&s;elf on the point of being tran&s;ported to &s;uch a di&s;tant and un|healthy climate, de&s;titute of every convenience that could render &s;uch a voyage &s;upportable, and under the domi|nion of an arbitrary tyrant, who&s;e command was almo&s;t intolerable. However, as the&s;e complaints were common to a great many on board, I re&s;olved to &s;ubmit patiently to my fate, and contrive to make my&s;elf as ea&s;y as the nature of the ca&s;e would allow.&mdash;We got out of the chan|nel with a pro&s;perous breeze, which died away, leaving us becalmed about fifty leagues to the we&s;tward of the Lizard; but this &s;tate of inaction did no la&s;t long; for next night our main-top-&s;ail was &s;plit by the wind, which in the morning increa&s;ed to a hurricane.&mdash;I was wakened by a mo&s;t horrible din, occa&s;ioned by the play of the gun|carriages upon the decks above, the cracking of cabins, the howling of the wind through the &s;hrouds, the con|fu&s;ed noi&s;e of the &s;hip's crew, the pipes of the boat&s;wain and his mates, the trumpets of the lieutenants, and the clanking of the chain-pumps&mdash;Morgan, who had never been at &s;ea before, turned out in a great hurry, crying,

The &s;ea was &s;welled into billows mountain-high, on the top of which our &s;hip &s;ometimes hung, as if it was to be precipitated to the aby&s;s below! Sometimes we &s;unk be|tween two waves that ro&s;e on each &s;ide higher than our top-ma&s;t head, and threatened, by da&s;hing together, to overwhelm us in a moment! Of all our fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of a hundred and fifty &s;ail, &s;carce twelve appeared, and the&s;e driving under their bare poles, at the mercy of the tem|pe&s;t. At length the ma&s;t of one of them gave way, and tumbled over-board with a hideous cra&s;h! Nor was the pro&s;pect in our own &s;hip much more agreeable; a number of officers and &s;ailors ran backward and forward with di|&s;traction in their looks, hallooing to one another, and undetermined what they &s;hould attend to fir&s;t. Some clung to the yards, endeavouring to unbend the &s;ails that were &s;plit into a thou&s;and pieces, flapping in the wind; others tried to furl tho&s;e which were yet whole, while the ma&s;ts, at every pitch, bent and quivered like twigs, as if they would have &s;hivered into innumerable &s;plinters!&mdash;While I con&s;idered this &s;cene with equal terror and a&s;to|ni&s;hment, one of the main-braces broke, by the &s;hock, whereof two &s;ailors were flung from the yard's arm into the &s;ea, where they peri&s;hed, and poor Jack Rattlin was thrown down upon the deck, at the expence of a broken leg. Morgan and I ran immediately to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and found a &s;plinter of the &s;hin-bone thru&s;t, by the violence of the fall, through the &s;kin: as this was a ca&s;e of too great con&s;equence to be treated without the authority of the doctor, I went down to his cabin to inform him of the accident, as well as to bring up dre&s;&s;ings, which we always kept ready prepared.&mdash;I entered his apartment without any ceremony, and, by the glimmering of a lamp, perceived him on his knees, before &s;omething that very much re&s;embled a crucifix; but this I will

When I &s;ignified to the boat&s;wain the doctor's de&s;ire, he &s;wore a terrible oath that he could not &s;pare one man from the deck, be|cau&s;e he expected the ma&s;t would go by the board every minute.&mdash;This piece of information did not at all contri|bute to my peace of mind; however, as my friend Rattlin complained very much, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Morgan, I &s;upported him to the lower deck, whither Mr. Mac&s;hane, after much entreaty, ventured to come, attended by Thom|&s;on with a box full of dre&s;&s;ings, and his own &s;ervant, who carried a whole &s;et of capital in&s;truments.&mdash;He examined the fracture and the wound, and, concluding from a livid colour extending it&s;elf upon the limb, that a mortifica|tion would en&s;ue, re&s;olved to amputate the leg immedi|ately.&mdash;This was a dreadful &s;entence to the patient, who recruiting him&s;elf with a quid of tobacco, pronounced with a woeful countenance, <Q>What! is there no remedy, doctor? mu&s;t I be dock'd! can't you &s;plice it?</Q>&mdash;"A&s;&s;uredly, Doctor Mac&s;hane," &s;aid the fir&s;t mate, <Q>with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and deference, and veneration to your &s;uperior abilities, and opportunities and &s;tations, (look you,) I do apprehend, and conjecture, and aver, that there is no occa&s;ion nor nece&s;&s;ity to &s;mite off this poor man's leg.</Q> <Q>God Almighty ble&s;s you, dear Welch|man!</Q> cried Rattlin, <Q>may you have fair wind and weather where&s;oever you're bound, and come to an an|chor in the road of heaven at la&s;t.</Q>&mdash;Mac&s;hane, very much incen&s;ed at his mate's differing in opinion from him &s;o openly, an&s;wered, that he was not bound to give an account of his practice to him, and, in a peremptory tone,

ordered him to apply the tourniquet. At the &s;ight of which, Jack &s;tarting up, cried, <Q>Ava&s;t, ava&s;t! d&mdash;n my heart, if you clap your nippers on me, till I know wherefore!&mdash;Mr. Random, won't you lend a hand to|wards &s;aving my precious limb?

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>We lament the fate of our companion&mdash;the captain offers Morgan his liberty, which he refu&s;es to accept&mdash;we are brought before him and examined&mdash;Morgan is &s;ent back into cu&s;tody, whither al&s;o I am remanded, after a curious trial.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE news of this event affected my fellow-pri&s;oner and me extremely, as our unfortunate companion had ju&s;tly acquired, by his amiable di&s;po&s;ition, the love and e&s;teem of us both; and the more we regretted his un|timely fate, the greater horror we conceived for the villain who was undoubtedly the occa&s;ion of it. This abandoned mi&s;creant did not di&s;cover the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of concern for Thom&s;on's death, although he mu&s;t have been con|&s;cious to him&s;elf of having driven him by ill u&s;age to that fatal re&s;olution; but de&s;ired the captain to &s;et Morgan at liberty again to look after the patients. Accordingly, one of the corporals was &s;ent up to unfetter him; and he pro|te&s;ted he would not be relea&s;ed until he &s;hould know for what he was confined, nor would he be a tennis-ball, nor a &s;huttle-cock, nor a trudge, nor a &s;cullion, to any captain under the &s;un. Oakhum, finding him ob&s;tinate, and fear|ing it would not be in his power to exerci&s;e his tyranny much longer with impunity, was willing to &s;hew &s;ome ap|pearance of ju&s;tice, and therefore ordered us both to be brought before him on the quarter-deck, where he &s;at in &s;tate, with his clerk on one &s;ide, and his coun&s;ellor Mac|&s;hane on the other. When we approached, he honoured us with this &s;alutation&mdash;<Q>So, gentlemen, damn my blood! many a captain in the navy would have ordered you both to be tuck'd up to the yard's arm, without either judge or jury, for the crimes you have been guilty of; but, damn my blood, I have too much good nature in

allowing &s;uch dogs as you to make your defence.</Q>&mdash;"Captain Oakhum," &s;aid my fellow-&s;ufferer, <Q>certainly it is in your power(G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t help the while) to tuck us all up at your will, and de&s;ire, and plea&s;ure&mdash;And perhaps it would be petter for &s;ome of us to be tucked up than undergo the mi&s;eries to which we have been expo&s;ed. So may the farmer hang his kids for his diver&s;ion, and amu&s;ement, and mirth; but there is &s;uch a thing as ju&s;tice, if not upon earth, &s;urely in heaven, that will puni&s;h with fire and prim&s;tone all tho&s;e that take away the lives of innocent people out of wantonne&s;s and par|parity, (look you)&mdash;In the mean time I &s;hall be glad to know the crimes laid to my charge, and &s;ee the per|&s;on who accu&s;es me.</Q>&mdash;"That you &s;hall," &s;aid the captain: "here, doctor, what have you to &s;ay?"&mdash;Mac|&s;hane, &s;tepping forward, hemmed a good while in order to clear his throat; and, before he began, Morgan acco&s;t|ed him thus: <Q>Doctor Mac&s;hane, look in my face&mdash;look in the face of an hone&s;t man, who abhors a fal&s;e wit|ne&s;s as he abhors the tevil, and Got be judge between you and me.</Q>&mdash;The doctor, not minding this conjura|tion, made the following &s;peech as near as I can remem|ber: <Q>I'll tell you what, Mr. Morgan, to be &s;ure what you &s;ay is ju&s;t, in regard to an hone&s;t man; and, if &s;o be it appears as how you are an hone&s;t man, then it is my opinion, that you de&s;erve to be acquitted in relation to that there affair; for I tell you what, Captain Oak|hum is re&s;olved for to do every body ju&s;tice.&mdash;As for my own part, all that I have to alledge is, that I have been informed you have &s;poken di&s;re&s;pectful words again&s;t your captain, who to be &s;ure is the mo&s;t ho|nourable and generous commander in the king's &s;ervice, without a&s;paragement or acceptation of man, woman, or child.</Q> Having uttered this elegant harangue, on which he &s;eemed to plume him&s;elf, Morgan replied, <Q>I do partly gue&s;s and conceive, and under&s;tand your meaning, which I wi&s;h could be more explicit; but, however, I do &s;uppo&s;e I am not to be condemned upon bare hear&s;ay, or, if I am convicted of &s;peaking di&s;re|&s;pectfully of Captain Oakhum, I hope there is no trea|&s;on in my words.</Q>&mdash;<Q>But there's mutiny, by God, and that's death by the articles of war,</Q> cried Oakhum.&mdash;

"In the mean time, let the witne&s;&s;es be called." Here|upon Mac&s;hane's &s;ervant appeared, and the boy of our me&s;s, whom they had &s;educed and tutored for the purpo&s;e. The fir&s;t declared, that Morgan, as he de&s;cended the cockpit-ladder one day, cur&s;ed the captain, and called him a &s;avage bea&s;t, &s;aying, he ought to be hunted down as an enemy to mankind.&mdash;"This," &s;aid the clerk, <Q>is a &s;trong pre&s;umption of a de&s;ign formed again&s;t the cap|tain's life.&mdash;For why? it pre&s;uppo&s;es malice afore|thought, and a criminal intention <HI>a priori.</HI></Q>&mdash;"Right," &s;aid the captain to this mi&s;erable grub who had been an attorney's boy; <Q>you &s;hall have law enough; here's Cook and Littlejohn for it.</Q> This evidence was confirmed by the boy, who affirmed he heard the fir&s;t mate &s;ay, that the captain had no more bowels than a bear, and the &s;urgeon had no more brains than an a&s;s. Then the centinel who heard our di&s;cour&s;e on the poop was examined, and in|formed the court, that the Welchman a&s;&s;ured me Captain Oakhum and Doctor Mac&s;hane would to&s;s upon billows of burning brim&s;tone in hell for their barbarity. The clerk ob&s;erved, that there was an evident prejudication, which confirmed the former &s;u&s;picion of a con&s;piracy again&s;t the life of Captain Oakhum; for, becau&s;e, how could Morgan &s;o po&s;itively pronounce that the captain and &s;urgeon would be damned, unle&s;s he had an intention to make away with them before they could have time to repent? This &s;age explanation had great weight with our noble commander, who exclaimed, <Q>What have you to &s;ay to this, Taffy? you &s;eem to be taken all a-back, brother, hah!</Q> Mor|gan was too much of a gentleman to di&s;own the text, al|though he ab&s;olutely denied the truth of the comment: upon which the captain, &s;trutting up to him with a fero|cious countenance, &s;aid, <Q>So, Mr. &s;on of a bitch, you confe&s;s you honoured me with the names of bear and bea&s;t, and pronounced my damnation! Damn my heart! I have a good mind to have you brought to a court|martial and hanged, you dog.</Q> Here Mac&s;hane, having occa&s;ion for an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, interpo&s;ed, and begged the captain to pardon Mr. Morgan, with his wonted goodne&s;s, upon condition that he the delinquent &s;hould make &s;uch &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion as the nature of his mi&s;demeanour demanded: up|on which the Cambro-Briton, who on this occa&s;ion would

have made no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Great Mogul &s;urrounded by all his guards, thanked the doctor for his mediation, and acknowledged him&s;elf in the wrong for calling the image of Got a pea&s;t; "but," &s;aid he, <Q>I &s;poke by metaphor, and parable, and compari&s;on, and types; as we &s;ignify meekne&s;s by a lamb, letchery by a goat, and craftine&s;s by a fox, &s;o we liken ignorance to an a&s;s, and brutality to a bear, and fury to a tyger; therefore I made u&s;e of the&s;e &s;imilies to expre&s;s my &s;entiments, (look you;) and what I &s;aid before Got I will not un|&s;ay before man or pea&s;t neither.</Q> Oakhum was &s;o pro|voked at this in&s;olence, (as he termed it,) that he order|ed him forthwith to be carried to the place of his confine|ment, and his clerk to proceed on the examination of me. The fir&s;t que&s;tion put to me was touching the place of my nativity, which I declared to be the north of Scotland. "The north of Ireland more like," cried the captain; "but we &s;hall bring you up pre&s;ently."

but I treated the notion of a real pre&s;ence with &s;uch di&s;|re&s;pect, that his patron was &s;candalized at my impiety, and commanded him to proceed to the plot: whereupon this mi&s;erable pettifogger told me, there was great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect me of being a &s;py on board, and that I had entered into a con&s;piracy with Thom&s;on, and others not yet detected, again&s;t the life of Captain Oakhum: which accu&s;ation they pretended to &s;upport by the evidence of our boy, who declared he had often heard the decea&s;ed Thom&s;on and me whi&s;pering together, and could di&s;tin|gui&s;h the words, "Oakhum, ra&s;cal, poi&s;on, pi&s;tol:" by which expre&s;&s;ions it appeared, we did intend to u&s;e &s;ini&s;ter means to accompli&s;h his de&s;truction&mdash;That the death of Thom&s;on &s;eemed to confirm this conjecture, who, either feeling the &s;tings of remor&s;e for being engaged in &s;uch a horrid confederacy, or fearing a di&s;covery, by which he mu&s;t have infallibly &s;uffered an ignominious death, had put a fatal period to his own exi&s;tence&mdash;But what e&s;tabli&s;hed the truth of the whole, was a book in cyphers found among my papers, which exactly tallied with one found in his che&s;t after his di&s;appearance: this, he ob&s;erved, was a pre&s;umption very near proof po&s;itive, and would determine any jury in Chri&s;tendom to find me guilty. In my own defence I alledged, that I had been dragged on board at fir&s;t very much again&s;t my inclination, as I could prove by the evidence of &s;ome people now in the &s;hip, con&s;e|quently could have no de&s;ign of becoming a &s;py at that time, and ever &s;ince had been entirely out of the reach of any corre&s;pondence that could ju&s;tly entail that &s;u&s;picion upon me&mdash;As for the con&s;piring again&s;t my captain's life, it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that any man in his right wits would harbour the lea&s;t thought of &s;uch an undertaking, which he could not po&s;&s;ibly perform without certain infa|my and ruin to him&s;elf, even if he had all the inclination in the world&mdash;That allowing the boy's evidence to be true, (which I affirmed was fal&s;e and malicious,) nothing conclu&s;ive could be gathered from a few incoherent words: neither was the fate of Mr. Thom&s;on a circum&s;tance more favourable for the charge; for I had in my pocket a letter which too well explained that my&s;tery in a very different manner from that which was &s;uppo&s;ed: with the&s;e words I produced the following letter, which Jack Rattlin

<P>This letter was no &s;ooner read than Mac&s;hane, in a tran&s;port of rage, &s;natched it out of the clerk's hands, and tore it into a thou&s;and pieces, &s;aying, it was a villainous forgery contrived and executed by my&s;elf. The captain and clerk declared them&s;elves of the &s;ame opinion, although I in&s;i&s;ted on having the remains of it compared with other writings of Thom&s;on which they had in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and I was ordered to an&s;wer the la&s;t article of my accu&s;a|tion, namely, the book of cyphers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound among my pa|pers. "That is ea&s;ily done," &s;aid I. <Q>What you are plea&s;ed to call cyphers are no other than the Greek characters, in which, for my amu&s;ement, I kept a diary of every thing remarkable, that has occurred to my ob|&s;ervation &s;ince the beginning of the voyage till the day on which I was put in irons; and the &s;ame method was practi&s;ed by Mr. Thom&s;on, who copied mine.</Q>&mdash;<Q>A very likely &s;tory!</Q> cried Mac&s;hane; <Q>what occa&s;ion was there for u&s;ing Greek characters, if you were not afraid of di&s;covering what you had wrote?&mdash;But what

d'ye talk of Greek characters?&mdash;D'ye think I am &s;o ignorant of the Greek language as not to di&s;tingui&s;h its letters from the&s;e, which are no more Greek than Chi|ne&s;e? No, no, I will not give up my knowledge of the Greek for you, nor none that ever came from your country.</Q> So &s;aying, with an unparalleled effrontery, he repeated &s;ome gibberi&s;h which by the &s;ound &s;eemed to be Iri&s;h, and made it pa&s;s for Greek with the captain, who, looking at me with a contemptuous &s;neer, exclaim|ed, "Ah, ha! have you caught a Tartar?" I could not help &s;miling at the con&s;ummate a&s;&s;urance of this Hiber|nian, and offered to refer the di&s;pute to any body on board who under&s;tood the Greek alphabet: upon which Morgan was brought back, and, being made acquainted with the affair, took the book, and read a whole page in Engli&s;h without he&s;itation, deciding the controver&s;y in my favour. The doctor was &s;o far from being out of countenance at this detection, that he affirmed Morgan was in the &s;ecret, and repeated from his own invention. Oakhum &s;aid, "Ay, ay, I &s;ee they are both in a &s;tory," and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my fellow-mate to his cock-loft, although I propo&s;ed that he and I &s;hould read and tran&s;late &s;eparately any chapter or ver&s;e in the Greek Te&s;tament in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by which it would appear whether we or the &s;urgeon &s;poke truth. Not being endued with eloquence enough to convince the captain, that there could be no juggle nor confederacy in this expedient, I begged to be examined by &s;ome uncon|cerned per&s;on on board who under&s;tood Greek: according|ly the whole &s;hip's company, officers and all, were called upon deck, among whom it was proclaimed, that, if any of them could &s;peak Greek, he or they &s;o qualified &s;hould a&s;cend the quarter deck immediately. After &s;ome pau&s;e, two forema&s;t men came up and profe&s;&s;ed their &s;kill in that language, which (they &s;aid) they acquired during &s;everal voyages to the Levant among the Greeks of the Morea. The captain exulted much in this declaration, and put my journal-book into the hands of one of them, who candidly owned he could neither read nor write; the other acknow|ledged the &s;ame degree of ignorance, but pretended to &s;peak the Greek lingo with any man on board, and, ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, pronounced &s;ome &s;entences of a barbarous corrupted language which I did not under&s;tand,

I a&s;&s;erted, that the modern Greek was as different from that &s;poke and written by the ancients as the Engli&s;h u&s;ed now from the old Saxon &s;poke in the time of Hengi&s;t; and as I had only learned the true original tongue, in which Homer, Pindar, the evangeli&s;ts, and other great men of antiquity wrote, it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ould know any thing of an imperfect Gothic dialect that ro&s;e on the ruins of the former, and &s;carce retained any traces of the old expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;but, if Dr. Mac&s;hane, who pretended to be ma&s;ter of the Greek language, could maintain a conver&s;ation with the&s;e &s;eamen, I would retract what I had &s;aid, and be content to &s;uffer any puni&s;hment he &s;hould think proper to inflict. I had no &s;ooner uttered the&s;e words than the &s;urgeon, knowing one of the fellows to be his countryman, acco&s;ted him in Iri&s;h, and was an|&s;wered in the &s;ame brogue; when a dialogue en&s;ued be|tween them, which they affirmed to be in Greek, after having &s;ecured the &s;ecrecy of the other tar, who had his cue, in the language of the Morea, from his compani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> before they would venture to a&s;&s;ert &s;uch an intrepid fal&s;e|hood.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>I di&s;cover a &s;ubordination again&s;t me, by means of a quarrel between two of the evidences; in con&s;equence of which, I am &s;et at liberty, and prevail upon Morgan to accept of his freedom on the &s;ame terms&mdash;Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hane's malice&mdash;we arrive at Jamaica, from whence in a &s;hort time we beat up to Hi&s;paniola, in conjunction with the We&s;t-India &s;qua|dron&mdash;we take in water, &s;ail again, and arrive at Car|thagena&mdash;reflections on our conduct there.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MEAN while, a quarrel happening between the two modern Greeks, the one, to be revenged of the other, came and di&s;covered to us the my&s;tery of Mac&s;hane's dialogue, as I have explained it above. This detection coming to the ears of the doctor, who was &s;en&s;ible that (now we were in &s;ight of Jamaica) we &s;hould have an op|portunity of clearing our&s;elves before a court-martial, and at the &s;ame time of making his malice and ignorance con|&s;picuous, he interceded for us with the captain &s;o effectu|ally, that in a few hours we were &s;et at liberty, and or|dered to return to our duty. This was a happy event for me, my whole body being bli&s;tered by the &s;un, and my limbs benumbed by want of motion: but I could &s;carce per&s;uade the Welchman to accept of this indulgence, he per&s;i&s;ting in his ob&s;tinacy to remain in irons, until he &s;hould be di&s;charged by a court-martial, which he believed would al&s;o do him ju&s;tice on his enemies; at length I re|pre&s;ented to him the precarious i&s;&s;ue of a trial, the power and intere&s;t of his adver&s;aries, and flattered his revenge with the hope of wreaking his re&s;entment with his own hands upon Mac&s;hane after our return to England. This la&s;t argument had more weight with him than all the re&s;t, and prevailed upon him to repair with me to the cockpit, which I no &s;ooner entered than the idea of my departed friend pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my remembrance, and filled my eyes with tears. We di&s;charged from our me&s;s the boy who had acted &s;o per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">idiou&s;ly, notwith&s;tanding his tears, entreaties, and profe&s;&s;ions of penitence for what he had done, but not before he had confe&s;&s;ed that the &s;urgeon had bribed him, to give evidence again&s;t us, with a pair
<PB N="196" REF="027715_0203_0FD5ECFB0ED04C20">
of &s;tockings and a couple of old cheek &s;hirts, of which his &s;ervant had &s;ince plundered him.</P>
<P>The keys of our che&s;ts and lockers being &s;ent to us by the doctor, we detained the me&s;&s;enger until we had ex|amined the contents; and my fellow-mate, finding all his Che&s;hire chee&s;e con&s;umed to a cru&s;t, his brandy exhau&s;ted, and his onions gone, was &s;eized with a fit of choler, which he di&s;charged on Mac&s;hane's man in oaths and exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">tions, threatening to pro&s;ecute him as a thief. The fellow &s;wore in his turn, that he never had the keys in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till that time, when he received them from his ma&s;ter, with orders to deliver them to us. "As Got is my judge," cried Morgan, <Q>and my &s;alfation, and my witne&s;s, who|ever has pilfered my provi&s;ions is a lou&s;y, peggarly, ra&s;|cally knave! and by the &s;oul of my grand&s;ire! I will im|peach, and accu&s;e, and indict him of a roppery, if I did but know who he is.</Q> Had this misfortune happened at &s;ea, where we could not repair the lo&s;s, in all probabi|lity this de&s;cendant of Caractacus would have lo&s;t his wits entirely; but, when I ob&s;erved how ea&s;y it would be to remedy this paltry mi&s;chance, he became more calm, and reconciled him&s;elf to the occa&s;ion. A little while after this tran&s;port, the &s;urgeon came into the birth under pretence of taking &s;omething out of the medicine-che&s;t, and with a &s;miling a&s;pect wi&s;hed us joy of our deliverance, which (he &s;aid) he had been at great pains to obtain of the cap|tain, who was very ju&s;tly incen&s;ed at our behaviour; but he (the doctor) had pa&s;&s;ed his word for our future con|duct, and he hoped we &s;hould give him no cau&s;e to repent of his kindne&s;s&mdash;He expected, no doubt, an acknowledg|ment from us for his pretended &s;ervice, as well as a ge|neral amne&s;ty of what was pa&s;t; but he had to do with people who were not quite &s;o apt to forgive injuries as he imagined, or to forget that, if our deliverance was owing to his mediation, our calamity was occa&s;ioned by his ma|lice: I therefore &s;at &s;ilent while my companion an&s;wered, <Q>Ay, ay, 'tis no matter&mdash;Got knows the heart&mdash;<HI>There is a time for all things,</HI> as the wi&s;e man &s;aith; <HI>there is a time for throwing away &s;tones, and a time to gather them up again.</HI></Q> He &s;eemed to be di&s;co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">certed at this reply, and went away in a pet, muttering &s;omething
<PB N="197" REF="027715_0204_0FD5ECFC8CEDB910">
about "Ingratitude" and "Fellows," of which we did not think fit to take any notice.</P>
<P>Our fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, having joined another that waited for us, lay at anchor about a month in the harbour of Port-Royal in Jamaica, during which time &s;omething of con&s;equence was certainly tran&s;acted, notwith&s;tanding the in&s;inuations of &s;ome who affirmed we had no bu&s;ine&s;s at all in that place; that, in order to take the advantage of the &s;ea&s;on proper for our enterpri&s;e, the We&s;t-India &s;quadron, which had previous notice of our coming, ought to have joined us at the we&s;t end of Hi&s;paniola, with nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores and re|fre&s;hments, from whence we could have failed directly for Carthagena, before the enemy could put them&s;elves in a good po&s;ture of defence, or indeed have an inkling of our de&s;ign. Be this as it will, we &s;ailed from Jamaica, and, in ten days or a fortnight, beat up again&s;t the wind as &s;ar as the i&s;le of Vache, with an intention, as was &s;aid, to attack the French fleet, then &s;uppo&s;ed to be lying near that place; but, before we arrived, they had &s;ailed for Europe, having fir&s;t di&s;patched an advice-boat to Cartha|gena with an account of our being in tho&s;e &s;eas, as al&s;o of our &s;trength and de&s;tination. We loitered here &s;ome days longer taking in wood and bracki&s;h water, in the u&s;e whereof, however, our admiral &s;eemed to con&s;ult the health of the men by re&s;tricting each to a quart a-day. At length we &s;et &s;ail, and arrived in a bay to the windward of Car|thagena, where we came to an anchor, and lay at our ea&s;e ten days longer. Here again, certain malicious people take occa&s;ion to blame the conduct of their &s;uperiors by &s;aying, that, in &s;o doing, they not only unprofitably wa&s;ted time which was very precious, con&s;idering the ap|proach of the rainy &s;ea&s;on, but al&s;o allowed the Spaniards to recollect them&s;elves from the terror occa&s;ioned by the approach of an Engli&s;h fleet, at lea&s;t three times as nu|merous as ever appeared in that part of the world before. But, if I might be allowed to give my opinion of the matter, I would a&s;cribe this delay to the genero&s;ity of our chiefs, who &s;corned to take any advantage, that fortune might give them, even over an enemy. At la&s;t, however, we weighed, and anchored again &s;omewhat nearer the harbour's mouth, where we made &s;hift to land our marines, who encamped on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> each in de&s;pite of the enemy's &s;hot,
<PB N="198" REF="027715_0205_0FD5ECFDDBA7ECF0">
which knocked a good many of them on the head. This piece of conduct in chu&s;ing a camp under the walls of an enemy's fortification, which I believe never happened be|fore, was practi&s;ed, I pre&s;ume, with a view of accu&s;tom|ing the &s;oldiers to &s;tand fire, who were not as yet much u&s;ed to di&s;cipline, mo&s;t of them having been taken from the plough-tail a few months before. This expedient again has furni&s;hed matter for cen&s;ure again&s;t the mini&s;try for &s;ending a few raw recruits on &s;uch an important en|terpri&s;e, while &s;o many veteran regiments lay inactive at home: but &s;urely our governors had their rea&s;ons for &s;o doing, which po&s;&s;ibly may be di&s;clo&s;ed with other &s;ecrets of the deep. Perhaps they were loth to ri&s;k their be&s;t troops on &s;uch de&s;perate &s;ervice; or the colonels and field-officers of the old corps, who, generally &s;peaking, enjoyed their commi&s;&s;ions as &s;inecures or pen&s;ions for &s;ome dome&s;tic &s;ervices tendered to the court, refu&s;ed to embark in &s;uch a dangerous and precarious undertaking, for which refu|&s;al, no doubt, they are to be much commended.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Our land-forces being di&s;embarked, erect a fa&s;cine battery&mdash;our &s;hip is ordered, with four more to batter the fort of Boca Chica&mdash;Mac&s;hane's cowardice&mdash;the chaplain's phrenzy&mdash;hone&s;t Rattlin lo&s;es one hand&mdash;his heroi&s;m, and reflections on the battle&mdash;Crampley's behaviour to me during the heat of the fight.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR forces being landed and &s;tationed, as I have al|ready mentioned, &s;et about erecting a fa&s;cine batte|ry to cannonade the principal fort of the enemy, and, in &s;omething more than three weeks, it was ready to open. That we might do the Spaniards as much honour as po&s;|&s;ible, it was determined in a council of war, that five of our large&s;t &s;hips &s;hould attack the fort on one &s;ide, while the battery, &s;trengthened by two mortars and twenty-four cohorns, &s;hould ply it on the other.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the &s;ignal for our &s;hip to engage, among others, was hoi&s;ted, we being adverti&s;ed the night before, to make every thing clear for that purpo&s;e: and in &s;o do|ing, a difference happened between Captain Oakhum and
<PB N="199" REF="027715_0206_0FD5ED01F0DB56E8">
his well-beloved cou&s;in and coun&s;ellor Mac&s;hane, which had well nigh terminated in an open rupture.&mdash;The doc|tor, who had imagined there was no more danger of be|ing hurt by the enemy's &s;hot in the cock-pit than in the centre of the earth, was lately informed that a &s;urgeon's mate had been killed in that part of a &s;hip, by a cannon ball from two &s;mall redoubts that were de&s;troyed before the di&s;embarkation of our &s;oldiers; and therefore in&s;i&s;ted upon having a platform rai&s;ed for the convenience of the &s;ick and wounded, in the after-hold, where he deemed him&s;elf more &s;ecure than on the deck above.&mdash;The cap|tain, offended at this extraordinary propo&s;al, accu&s;ed him of pu&s;illanimity, and told him there was no room in the hold for &s;uch an occa&s;ion; or if there was, he could not expect to be indulged more than the re&s;t of the &s;urgeons of the navy, who u&s;ed the cockpit for that purpo&s;e: fear rendered Mac&s;hane ob&s;tinate, he per&s;i&s;ted in his demand, and &s;hewed his in&s;tructions, by which it was authori&s;ed: the captain &s;wore the&s;e in&s;tructions were dictated by a parcel of lazy poltroons who were never at &s;ea; neverthe|le&s;s he was obliged to comply, and &s;ent for the carpenter to give him orders about it: but before any &s;uch mea&s;ure could be taken, our &s;ignal was thrown out, and the doc|tor compelled to tru&s;t his carca&s;e in the cockpit, where Morgan and I were bu&s;y in putting our in&s;truments and dre&s;&s;ings in order.</P>
<P>Our &s;hip, with others de&s;tined for this &s;ervice, imme|diately weighed, and in le&s;s than half an hour came to an anchor before the ca&s;tle of Boca Chica, with a &s;pring upon our cable&mdash;and the cannonading (which indeed was terrible!) began. The &s;urgeon, after having cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, fell flat on the deck; and the chaplain and pur|&s;er, who were &s;tationed with us, in quality of a&s;&s;i&s;tants, followed his example, while the Welchman and I &s;at upon a che&s;t looking at one another with great compo&s;ure, &s;carce able to refrain from the like pro&s;tration.&mdash;And that the reader may know, it was not a common occa&s;ion that alarmed us thus, I mu&s;t inform him of the particulars of this dreadful din that a&s;toni&s;hed us. The fire of the Spa|niards proceeded from eighty-four great guns, be&s;ides a mortar and &s;mall arms in Boca Chica, thirty-&s;ix in Fort St. Jo&s;eph, twenty in two fa&s;cine batteries, and four men

of war, mounting &s;ixty-four guns each.&mdash;This was an|&s;wered by our land-battery mounted with twenty-one can|non, two mortars and twenty-four cohorns, and five great &s;hips of eighty or &s;eventy guns that fired without inter|mi&s;&s;ion&mdash;We had not been many minutes engaged, when one of the &s;ailors brought another on his back to the cockpit, where he to&s;&s;ed him down like a bag of oats, and pulling out his pouch, put a large chew of tobacco in his mouth without &s;peaking a word; Morgan immedi|ately examined the condition of the wounded man, and cried, <Q>As I &s;hall an&s;wer now, the man is as tead as my great-grandfather.</Q>&mdash;"Dead," &s;aid his comrade, <Q>he may be dead now, for ought I know, but I'll be damn'd if he was not alive when I took him up.</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying, he was about to return to his quarters, when I bade him carry the body along with him, and throw it over-board.&mdash;"D&mdash;n the body," &s;aid he, <Q>I think 'tis fair enough if I take care of my own.</Q>&mdash;My fellow|mate &s;natching up the amputation-kni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, pur&s;ued him half way up the cockpit-ladder, crying, <Q>You lou&s;y ra&s;cal, is this the church-yard, or the charnal-hou&s;e, or the &s;epulchre, or the Golgotha of the &s;hip!</Q>&mdash;but was &s;topt in his career by one calling, <Q>Yo ho, ava&s;t there&mdash;Scaldings!</Q>&mdash;"Scaldings!" an&s;wered Morgan, <Q>Got knows 'tis hot enough indeed:&mdash;who are you?</Q>&mdash;"Here's one," replied the voice&mdash;And I immediately knew it to be that of my hone&s;t friend Jack Rattlin, who coming towards me, told me with great deliberation, he was coming to be docked at la&s;t, and di&s;covered the re|mains of one hand which had been &s;hattered to pieces with a grape &s;hot.&mdash;I lamented with unfeigned &s;orrow his mi&s;|fortune, which he bore with heroic courage, ob&s;erving, that every &s;hot had its commi&s;&s;ion: it was well it did not take him in the head; or if it had, what then? he &s;hould have died bravely fighting for his king and country: Death was a debt which every man owed, and mu&s;t pay; and that now as well as another time.&mdash;I was much plea|&s;ed and edified with the maxims of this &s;ea philo&s;opher, who endured the amputation of his left hand without &s;hrinking; the operation being performed (at his reque&s;t) by me, after Mac&s;hane, who was with difficulty prevailed to lift up his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from the deck, had declared there was
<PB N="201" REF="027715_0208_0FD5ED062ED81890">
a nece&s;&s;ity for his lo&s;ing the limb.&mdash;While I was employ|ed in dre&s;&s;ing the &s;tump, I a&s;ked Jack's opinion of the battle, who, &s;haking his head, frankly told me, he be|lieved we &s;hould do no good; <Q>For why, becau&s;e in&s;tead of dropping anchor clo&s;e under &s;hore, where we &s;hould have had to deal with one corner of Boca Chica only, we had opened the harbour, and expo&s;ed our&s;elves to the whole fire of the enemy from their &s;hipping and fort St. Jo&s;eph, as well as from the ca&s;tle we intended to cannonade; that be&s;ides, we lay at too great a di&s;|tance to damage the walls, and three parts in four of our &s;hot did not take place; for there was &s;carce any body on board, who under&s;tood the pointing of a gun.&mdash;Ah! God help us!</Q>&mdash;continued he, <Q>if your kin&s;|man Lieutenant Bowling had been here, we &s;hould have had other gue&s;s-work.</Q>&mdash;By this time our patients had increa&s;ed to &s;uch a number, that we did not know which to begin with; and the fir&s;t mate plainly told the &s;urgeon, that if he did not get up immediately, and perform his duty, he would complain of his behaviour to the admiral, and make application for his warrant.&mdash;This remon&s;trance effectually rou&s;ed Mac&s;hane, who was never deaf to an argument in which he thought his intere&s;t con|cerned; he therefore ro&s;e up, and, in order to &s;trengthen his re&s;olution, had recour&s;e more than once to ca&s;e-bot|tle of rum, which he freely communicated to the chap|lain and pur&s;er, who had as much need of &s;uch extraor|dinary in&s;piration as him&s;elf. Being thus &s;upported he went to work, and arms and legs were hewed down with|out mercy.&mdash;The fumes of the liquor mounting into the par&s;on's brain, con&s;pired with his former agitation of &s;pirits, to make him quite delirious; he &s;tript him&s;elf to the &s;kin, and be&s;mearing his body with blood, could &s;carce be with-held from running upon deck in that con|dition. Jack Rattlin, &s;candalized at this deportment, en|deavoured to allay his tran&s;ports with rea&s;on: but finding all he &s;aid ineffectual, and great confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned by his frolics, he knocked him down with his right hand, and by threats kept him quiet in that &s;tate of humiliation.&mdash;But it was not in the power of rum to elevate the pur&s;er, who &s;at on the floor wringing his hands, and cur&s;ing the hour in which he left his peaceable profe&s;&s;ion of a brewer in Ro|che&s;ter,

<P>HAVING cannonaded the fort, during the &s;pace of four hours, we were all ordered to &s;lip our cables, and &s;heer off, but next day the engagement was renew|ed, and continued from the morning till the afternoon, when the enemy's fire from Boca-Chica &s;lackened, and towards the evening was quite &s;ilenced.&mdash;A breach being made on the other &s;ide, by our land-battery, large enough to admit a middle-&s;ized baboon, provided he could find means to climb up to it; our general propo&s;ed to give the a&s;&s;ault that very night, and actually ordered a de|tachment on that duty: Providence &s;tood our friend upon this occa&s;ion, and put it into the hearts of the Spaniards to abandon the fort, which might have been maintained by re&s;olute men to the day of judgment again&s;t all the force we could exert in the attack.&mdash;And while our &s;ol|diers took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy's ramparts, without re|&s;i&s;tance, the &s;ame good luck attended a body of &s;ailors, who made them&s;elves, ma&s;ters of fort St. Jo&s;eph, the fa&s;cine batteries, and one Spani&s;h man of war; the other three being burnt or &s;unk by the foe, that they might not fall into our hands.&mdash;The taking of the&s;e forts, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;trength of which the Spaniards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">,

made us ma&s;ters of the outward harbour, and occa&s;ioned great joy among us, as we laid our accounts with finding little or no oppo&s;ition from the town: and indeed, if a few great &s;hips had &s;ailed up immediately, before they had recovered from the confu&s;ion and de&s;pair that our un|expected &s;ucce&s;s had produced among them, it is not im|po&s;&s;ible that we might have fini&s;hed the affair to our &s;a|tisfaction, without any more blood&s;hed; but this &s;tep our heroes di&s;dained, as a barbarous in&s;ult over the enemy's di&s;tre&s;s; and gave them all the re&s;pite they could de&s;ire, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> order to recollect them&s;elves.&mdash;In the mean time Mac|&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e, taking the advantage of this general exultation, waited on our captain, and pleaded his own cau&s;e &s;o ef|fectua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, that he was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in his good graces; and as for Crampley, there was no more notice taken of his behaviour towards me, during the action.&mdash;But of all the con&s;equences of the victory, none was more grateful than plenty of fre&s;h water, after we had langui&s;hed five weeks on the allowance of a pur&s;er's quart <HI>per diem,</HI> for each man, in the Torrid Zone, where the &s;un was verti|cal, and the expence of bodily fluid &s;o great, that a gal|lon of liquor could &s;carce &s;upply the wa&s;te of twenty-four hours; e&s;pecially as our provi&s;ion con&s;i&s;ted of putrid &s;alt beef, to which the &s;ailors gave the name of Iri&s;h hor&s;e; &s;alt pork of New-England, which though neither fi&s;h nor fle&s;h, favoured of both; bread from the &s;ame coun|try, every bi&s;cuit whereof, like a piece of clock-work, moved by its own internal impul&s;e, occa&s;ioned by the my|riads of in&s;ects that dwelt within it; and butter &s;erved out by the gill, that ta&s;ted like train-oil thickened with &s;alt. In&s;tead of &s;mall beer, each man was allowed three half-quarterns of brandy or rum, which were di&s;tributed every morning, diluted with a certain quantity of water, with|out either &s;ugar or fruit to render it palatable, for which rea&s;on this compo&s;ition was by the &s;ailors not unaptly &s;tiled <HI>nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> Nor was this limitation of &s;imple element owing to a &s;carcity of it on board, for there was at this time water enough in the &s;hip for a voyage of &s;ix months, at the rate of a half a gallon <HI>per</HI> day to each man: but this fa&s;t mu&s;t (I &s;uppo&s;e) have been enjoined by way of pe|nance on the &s;hip's company for their &s;ins; or rather with a view to mortify them into a contempt of life, that they

might thereby become more re&s;olute and regardle&s;s of dan|ger. How &s;imply then do tho&s;e people argue, who a&s;cribe the great mortality among us to our bad provi&s;ion and want of water; and affirm, that a great many valuable lives might have been &s;aved, if the u&s;ele&s;s tran&s;ports had been employed in fetching fre&s;h &s;tock, turtle, fruit, and other refre&s;hments from Jamaica, and other adjacent i&s;lands, for the u&s;e of the army and fleet! &s;eeing it is to be hoped, that tho&s;e who died went to a better place, and tho&s;e who &s;urvived were the more ea&s;ily maintained.&mdash;After all, a &s;ufficient number remained to fall before the walls of St. Lazar, where they behaved like their own country ma|&s;tiffs, which &s;hut their eyes, run into the jaws of a bear, and have their heads cru&s;hed for their valour.</P>
<P>But to return to my narration: after having put gar|ri&s;ons into the forts we had taken, and re-embarked our &s;oldiers and artillery, a piece of &s;ervice that detained us more than a week; we ventured up to the mouth of the inner harbour, guarded by a large fortification on one &s;ide, and a &s;mall redoubt on the other, both of which were de&s;erted before our approach, and the entrance of the harbour blocked up by &s;everal old galleons and two men of war that the enemy had &s;unk in the channel.&mdash;We made &s;hift, however, to open a pa&s;&s;age for &s;ome &s;hips, that fa|voured a &s;econd landing of troops at a place called La Quinta, not far from the town, where, after a faint re|&s;i&s;tance from a body of Spaniards, who oppo&s;ed their di&s;|embarkation, they encamped with a de&s;ign of be&s;ieging the ca&s;tle of St. Lazar, which overlooked and command|ed the city: whether our renowned general had no body in his army who knew how to approach it in form, or that he tru&s;ted entirely to the &s;ame of his arms, I will not de|termine; but, certain it is, a re&s;olution was taken in a council of war, to attack the place with mu&s;quetry only. This was put in execution, and &s;ucceeded accordingly: the enemy giving them &s;uch an hearty reception, that the greate&s;t part of the detachment took up their everla&s;ting abode on the &s;pot.&mdash;Our chief, not reli&s;hing this kind of complai&s;ance in the Spaniards, was wi&s;e enough to retreat on board with the remains of his army, which, from eight thou&s;and able men landed on the beach near Boca Chica, was now reduced to fifteen hundred fit for &s;ervice.&mdash;The

&s;ick and wounded were &s;queezed into certain ve&s;&s;els, which thence obtained the name of ho&s;pital &s;hips, though me|thinks they &s;carce de&s;erved &s;uch a creditable title, &s;eeing few of them could boa&s;t of their &s;urgeon, nur&s;e, or cook; and the &s;pace between decks was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o confined, that the mi&s;erable patients had not room to &s;it upright in their beds.

<P>A day or two after the attempt on St. Lazar, the ad|miral ordered one of the Spani&s;h men of war we had taken to be mounted with &s;ixteen guns, and manned with de|tachments from our great &s;hips, in order to batter the town; accordingly, &s;he was towed into the inner harbour in the night, and moored within half a mile of the walls

<P>Our conductors, finding things in this &s;ituation, per|ceived it was high time to relinqui&s;h our conque&s;ts; and this we did, after having rendered their artillery u&s;ele&s;s, and blown up their walls with gun-powder.

This reply di&s;con|certed him a little; however, he explained away his mean|ing in making learned di&s;tinctions between what was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary and what was only convenient; then proceeded to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> what religion I profe&s;&s;ed? I an&s;wered that I had not as yet con&s;idered the difference of religions, con&s;equently had not fixed on any one in particular, but that I was bred a Pre&s;byterian. At this word the chap|lain expre&s;&s;ed great a&s;toni&s;hment, and &s;aid, he could not comprehend how a Pre&s;byterian was entitled to any po&s;t under the Engli&s;h government. Then he a&s;ked if I had ever received the &s;acrament, or taken the oaths? To which que&s;tions I replying in the negative, he held up his hands, a&s;&s;ured me he could do me no &s;ervice, wi&s;hed I might not be in a &s;tate of reprobation, and returned to his me&s;s|mates, who were making merry in the ward-room round

This in&s;inu|ation, terrible as it was, had not &s;uch an effect upon me as the fever, which &s;oon after he had le&s;t me, grew out|rageous; I began to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;trange chimeras, and concluded my&s;elf on the point <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> becoming delirious. In the mean time, being in great danger of &s;uffocation, I &s;tarted up in a kind of frantic fit, with an intention to plunge my&s;elf into the &s;ea, and, as my friend the &s;erjeant was not pre|&s;ent, would certainly have cooled my&s;elf to &s;ome purpo&s;e, had I not perceived a moi&s;ture upon my thigh as I endea|voured to get out of my hammoc. The appearance of this renewed my hopes, and I had reflection and re&s;olution enough to take the advantage of this favourable &s;ymptom, by tearing the &s;hirt from my body and the &s;heets from the bed, and wrapping my&s;elf in a thick blanket, in which inclo&s;ure, for about a quarter of an hour, I felt the pains of hell; but it was not long before I was recompen&s;ed for my &s;uffering by a profu&s;e &s;weat, that, bur&s;ting from the whole &s;urface of my &s;kin, in le&s;s than two hours relieved me from all my complaints except that of weakne&s;s, and left me as hungry as a kite. I enjoyed a very comfortable nap, after which I was regaling my&s;elf with the agreeable reverie of my future happine&s;s, when I heard Morgan, on the out&s;ide of the curtain, a&s;k the &s;erjeant if I was alive &s;till? "Alive!" cried the other; <Q>God forbid he &s;hould be otherwi&s;e! he has lain quiet the&s;e five hours, and I do not chu&s;e to di&s;turb him; for &s;leep will do him great &s;ervice.</Q>&mdash;"Ay," &s;aid my fellow-mate, <Q>he &s;leeps &s;o &s;ound, (look you,) that he will never waken till the great trump plows.&mdash;Got be merciful to his &s;oul&mdash;He has paid his debt like an hone&s;t man&mdash;Ay, and more|over, he is at re&s;t from all per&s;ecutions, and troubles, and afflictions, of which Got knows, and I know, he had his own &s;hare&mdash;Ochree!

It was &s;ome time before he could recollect him&s;elf &s;o far as to feel my pul&s;e, and inquire into the particulars of my di&s;ea&s;e&punc; but, when he found I had enjoyed a favourable cri&s;is, he congratulated me upon my good fortune, not failing to a&s;cribe it, under Got, to the bli&s;ter he had applied to my back at his la&s;t vi&s;it, "which, by the bye," &s;aid he, <Q>mu&s;t now be removed and dre&s;&s;ed:</Q> he was actually going to fetch dre&s;&s;ings, when I feigning a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;aid, <Q>Ble&s;s me! &s;ure you never applied a bli&s;ter to me&mdash;there is nothing on my back, I a&s;&s;ure you.</Q> But he could not be convinced till he had examined it, and then endea|voured to conceal his confu&s;ion, by expre&s;&s;ing his &s;urpri&s;e in finding the &s;kin untouched, and the plai&s;ter mi&s;&s;ing. In order to excu&s;e my&s;elf for paying &s;o little regard to his pre&s;cription, I pretended to have been in&s;en&s;ible when it was put on, and to have pulled it off afterwards in a fit of delirium.

At this declaration he grinned, &s;hook his fi&s;t, and &s;wore he longed for nothing more than &s;uch an opportunity.</P>
<P>Mean while our &s;hip was ordered to be heaved down, victualled and watered, for her return to England; and our captain, for &s;ome rea&s;on or other, not thinking it con|venient for him to revi&s;it his native country at this time, exchanged with a gentleman, who on the other hand wi&s;hed for nothing &s;o much as to be &s;afe without the tro|pic, all his care and tenderne&s;s of him&s;elf being in&s;ufficient to pre&s;erve his complexion from the injuries of the &s;un and weather.</P>
<P>Our tyrant having left the &s;hip, and carried his favour|ite Mac&s;hane along with him, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atis|faction, our new commander came on board in a ten oar|ed barge over&s;hadowed with a va&s;t umbrella, and appeared in every thing the rever&s;e of Oakhum, being a tall, thin, young man, dre&s;&s;ed in this manner&mdash;A white hat, garni&s;h|ed with a red feather, adorned his head, from whence his hair &s;lowed upon his &s;houlders in ringlets tied behind with a ribbon: his coat, con&s;i&s;ting of pink-coloured &s;ilk, lined with white, by the elegance of the cut, retired backward, as it were, to di&s;cover a white &s;attin wai&s;tcoat embroidered with gold, unbuttoned at the upper part to di&s;play a broach &s;et with garnets, that glittered in the brea&s;t of his &s;hirt, which was of the fine&s;t cambric, edged with rich Mechlin: the knees of his crim&s;on-velvet breeches &s;carce de&s;cended &s;o low as to meet his &s;ilk &s;tockings, which ro&s;e, without &s;pot or wrinkle on his meagre legs, from &s;hoes of blue Meroquin, &s;tudded with diamond buckles that flamed forth

rivals to the &s;un! A &s;teel-hilted &s;word, inlaid with gold, and decked with a knot of ribbon which fell down in a rich ta&s;&s;el, equipped his &s;ide, and an amber-headed cane hung dangling from his wri&s;t: but the mo&s;t remarkable parts of his furniture were a ma&s;k on his face, and white gloves on his hands, which did not &s;eem to be put on with an intention to be pulled off occa&s;ionally, but were fixed with a curious ring on the little finger of each hand. In this garb Captain Whiffle (for that was his name) took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;hip, &s;urrounded with a crowd of attend|ants, all of whom, in their different degrees, &s;eemed to be of their patron's di&s;po&s;ition; and the air was &s;o impreg|nated with perfumes, that one may venture to affirm the clime of Arabia Felix was not half &s;o &s;weet &s;cented. My fellow-mate, ob&s;erving no &s;urgeon among his train, thought he had found an occa&s;ion too favourable for him|&s;elf to be neglected, and remembering the old proverb, "Spare to &s;peak, and &s;pare to &s;peed," re&s;olved to &s;olicit the new captain's intere&s;t immediately, before any other &s;urgeon could be appointed for the &s;hip. With this view he repaired to the cabin in his ordinary dre&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting of a check &s;hirt and trow&s;ers, a brown linen wai&s;tcoat, and a night-cap of the &s;ame, (neither of them very clean,) which, for his future misfortune, happened to &s;mell &s;trong of tobacco. Entering without any ceremony into this &s;acred place, he found Captain Whiffle repo&s;ing upon a couch, with a wrapper of fine chintz about his body, and a mu&s;lin cap, bordered with lace, about his head; and, after &s;everal low congees, began in this manner: <Q>Sir, I hope you will forgive, and excu&s;e, and pardon the pre&s;umption of one who has not the honour of being known unto you, but who is, neverthele&s;s, a &s;hentle|man porn and pred, and moreover has had misfortunes, Got help me, in the world.</Q>&mdash;Here he was interrupted by the captain, who, on &s;eeing him, had &s;tarted up with great amazement at the novelty of the apparition, and, having recollected him&s;elf, pronounced with a look and tone &s;ig|nifying di&s;dain, curio&s;ity and &s;urpri&s;e, <Q>Zauns! who art thou?</Q>&mdash;<Q>I am &s;urgeon's fir&s;t mate on board of this &s;hip,</Q> replied Morgan, <Q>and I mo&s;t vehemently de&s;ire and be&s;eech you, with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to be plea|&s;ed to conde&s;cend and vouch&s;afe to inquire into my

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HE was going on with an eulogium upon the captain, when I received a me&s;&s;age to clean my&s;elf and go up to the great cabin; and with this command I in&s;tantly complied, &s;weetening my&s;elf with ro&s;e-water from the medicine che&s;t. When I entered the room, I was ordered to &s;tand by the door until Captain Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">le had reconnoi|tred me at a di&s;tance with a &s;py-gla&s;s. He, having con|&s;ulted one &s;en&s;e in this manner, bade me advance gradu|ally, that his no&s;e might have intelligence before it could be much offended: I therefore approached with great caution and &s;ucce&s;s, and he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q>Ay, this creature is tolerable.</Q> I found him lolling on his couch with a langui&s;hing air, his head &s;upported by his valet de chambre, who from time to time applied a &s;melling-bottle to his no&s;e. "Vergette," &s;aid he in a &s;queaking tone, "do&s;t thou think this wretch," meaning me, <Q>will do me no injury? may I venture to &s;ubmit my arm to him?</Q> "'Pon my vord," replied the valet, <Q>I do tink dat dere be great occa&s;ion for your honour lo&s;ing one &s;mall quan|tite of blodt, and the young man ave <HI>quelque cho&s;e</HI> of de <HI>bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n.</HI></Q>&mdash;"Well then," &s;aid his ma&s;ter, <Q>I think I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t venture.</Q> Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, <Q>Ha&s;t thou ever blooded any body but brutes?&mdash;But I need not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thee; for thou wilt tell me a mo&s;t damn|able

lie.</Q>&mdash;"Brutes, Sir," an&s;wered I, pulling down his glove in order to feel his pul&s;e, <Q>I never meddle with brutes.</Q>&mdash;"What the devil art thou about?" cried he; <Q>do&s;t thou intend to twi&s;t off my hand! Gad's cur&s;e! my arm is benumbed up to the very &s;houlder! Heaven have mercy upon me! mu&s;t I peri&s;h under the hands of &s;avages? What an unfortunate dog was I to come on board without my own &s;urgeon Mr. Simper!</Q>&mdash;I cra|ved pardon for having handled him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o roughly, and with the utmo&s;t care and tenderne&s;s tied up his arm with a fillet of &s;ilk. While I was feeling for the vein, he de&s;ired to know how much blood I intended to take from him, and when I an&s;wered, "Not above twelve ounces," &s;tarted up with a look full of horror, and bade me begone, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear|ing I had a de&s;ign upon his life. Vergette appea&s;ed him with difficulty, and, opening a bureau, took out a pair of &s;cales, in one of which was placed a &s;mall cup, and, put|ting them into my hand, told me, the captain never lo&s;t above an ounce and three drachms at one time. While I prepared for this important evacuation, there came into the cabin a young man gaily dre&s;&s;ed, of a very delicate complexion, with a kind of a languid &s;mile on his face, which &s;eemed to have been rendered habitual by a long cour&s;e of affectation&punc; The captain no &s;ooner perceived him, than, ri&s;ing ha&s;tily, he flew into his arms, crying, <Q>O! my dear Simper! I am exce&s;&s;ively di&s;ordered! I have been betrayed, frighted, murdered, by the negligence of my &s;ervants, who &s;uffered a bea&s;t, a mule, a bear, to &s;urpri&s;e me, and &s;tink me into convul&s;ions with the fumes of tobacco.</Q> Simper (who, by this time I found, was obliged to art for the clearne&s;s of his complexion) a&s;|&s;umed an air of &s;oftne&s;s and &s;ympathy, and lamented, with many tender expre&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow, the &s;ad accident that had thrown him into that condition; then, feeling his patient's pul&s;e on the out&s;ide of his glove, gave it as his opinion, that his di&s;order was entirely nervous, and that &s;ome drops of tincture of ca&s;tor and liquid laudanum would be of more &s;ervice to him than bleeding, by bridling the inordinate &s;allies of his &s;pirits, and compo&s;ing the fermen|tation of his bile. I was therefore &s;ent to prepare this pre&s;cription, which was admini&s;tered in a gla&s;s of &s;ack|po&s;&s;et after the captain had been put to bed, and orders
<PB N="219" REF="027715_0226_0FD5ED2B20D1D330">
&s;ent to the officers on the quarter-deck to let nobody walk on that &s;ide under which he lay.</P>
<P>While the captain enjoyed his repo&s;e, the doctor watch|ed over him, and indeed became &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that a cabin was made for him contiguous to the &s;tate-room, where Whiffle &s;lept, that he might be at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and in ca&s;e of acci|dents in the night. Next day our commander being hap|pily recovered, gave orders, that none of the lieutenants &s;hould appear upon deck without a wig, &s;word and ruf|fles, nor any mid&s;hipman, or other petty officer, be &s;een with a check &s;hirt or dirty linen. He al&s;o prohibited any per&s;on whatever, except Simper and his own &s;ervants, from coming into the great cabin, without fir&s;t &s;ending in to obtain leave. The&s;e &s;ingular regulations did not prepo&s;|&s;e&s;s the &s;hip's company in his favour, but on the contrary gave &s;candal an opportunity to be very bu&s;y with his cha|racter, and accu&s;e him of maintaining a corre&s;pondence with his &s;urgeon not fit to be named.</P>
<P>In a few weeks, our &s;hip being under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ailing orders, I was in hope of revi&s;iting my native country in a very &s;hort time, when the admiral's &s;urgeon came on board, and, &s;ending for Morgan and me on the quarter-deck, gave us to under&s;tand there was a great &s;carcity of &s;urgeons in the We&s;t-Indies; that he was commanded to detain one mate out of every great &s;hip that was bound for England, and de&s;ired us to agree between our&s;elves, before the next day at that hour, which of us &s;hould &s;tay behind. We were thunder-&s;truck at this propo&s;al, and &s;tared at one another &s;ome time without &s;peaking; at length the Welchman broke &s;ilence, and offered to remain in the We&s;t-Indies, provided the admiral would give him a &s;urgeon's warrant immediately: but he was told there was no want of chief &s;urgeons, and that he mu&s;t be contented with the &s;tation of mate till he &s;hould be further provided for in due cour&s;e; whereupon Morgan flatly refu&s;ed to quit the &s;hip for which the commi&s;&s;ioners of the navy had appointed him, and the other told him as plainly, that, if we could not determine the affair by our&s;elves before to-morrow morning, he mu&s;t ca&s;t lots, and abide by his chance.&mdash;When I recalled to my remembrance the mi&s;eries I had undergone in England, where I had not one friend to promote my intere&s;t, or favour my advancement in the

navy, and at the &s;ame time reflected on the pre&s;ent dearth of &s;urgeons in the We&s;t-Indies, and the unhealthine&s;s of the climate which every day almo&s;t reduced the number, I could not help thinking, my &s;ucce&s;s would be much more certain and expeditious by my &s;taying where I was, than by returning to Europe&mdash;I therefore re&s;olved to comply with a good grace, and next day, when we were ordered to throw the dice, told Morgan he needed not trou|ble him&s;elf, for I would voluntarily &s;ubmit to the admi|ral's plea&s;ure. This frank declaration was commended by the gentleman, who a&s;&s;ured me it &s;hould not fare the wor&s;e with me for my re&s;ignation. Indeed he was as good as his word, and that very afternoon procured a warrant, appointing me &s;urgeon's mate of the Lizard &s;loop of war, which put me on a footing with every fir&s;t mate in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>My ticket being made out, I put my che&s;t and bedding on board a canoe that lay along-&s;ide, and having &s;hook hands with my tru&s;ty friend the &s;erjeant, and hone&s;t Jack Rattlin, who was bound for Greenwich ho&s;pital, I took my leave of Morgan with many tears, after we had ex|changed our &s;leeve-buttons as remembrances of each other.&mdash;Having pre&s;ented my new warrant to the captain of the Lizard, I inquired for the doctor, whom I no &s;ooner &s;aw, than I recollected him to be one of tho&s;e young fellows with whom I had been committed to the round|hou&s;e, during our frolic with Jack&s;on, as I have related before.&mdash;He received me with a good deal of courte&s;y, and when I put him in mind of our former acquaintance, expre&s;&s;ed great joy at &s;eeing me again, and recommended me to an exceeding good me&s;s, compo&s;ed of the gunner and ma&s;ter's mate.&mdash;As there was not one &s;ick per&s;on in the &s;hip, I got leave to go a-&s;hore, next day, with the gunner, who recommended me to a Jew, that bought my ticket at the rate of 40 <HI>per cent.</HI> di&s;count; and having furni&s;hed my&s;elf with what nece&s;&s;aries I wanted, returned on board in the evening, and to my &s;urpri&s;e found my old antagoni&s;t Crampley walking upon deck.&mdash;Though I did not fear his enmity, I was &s;hocked at his appearance, and communicated my &s;entiments on that &s;ubject to Mr. Tom|lins the &s;urgeon, who told me that Crampley, by dint of &s;ome friends about the admiral, had procured a commi&s;|&s;ion,

<P>In le&s;s than a week we &s;ailed on a cruize, and having weathered the ea&s;t end of the i&s;land, had the good for|tune to take a Spani&s;h barcolongo, with her prize, which was an Engli&s;h &s;hip bound for Bri&s;tol, that had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed from Jamaica a fortnight before, without convoy. All the pri&s;oners, who were well, we put on &s;hore on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land; the prizes were manned with Engli&s;h|men, and the command of the barcolongo given to my friend the ma&s;ter's mate, with orders to carry them into Port Morant, and there to remain until the Lizard's cruize &s;hould be ended, at which time &s;he would touch at the &s;ame place in her way to Port Royal&mdash;With him I was &s;ent to attend the wounded Spaniards as well as Engli&s;hmen, who amounted to &s;ixteen, and to take care of them on &s;hore, in a hou&s;e that was to be hired as an ho&s;pital.&mdash;This de&s;tination gave me a great deal of plea|&s;ure, as I &s;hould, for &s;ome time, be freed from the arro|gance of Crampley&punc; who&s;e inveteracy again&s;t me had al|ready broke out on two or three occa&s;ions &s;ince he was become a lieutenant.&mdash;My me&s;s-mate, who very much re|&s;embled my uncle, both in figure and di&s;po&s;ition, treated me on board of the prize with the utmo&s;t civility and con|fidence; and, among other favours, made me a pre&s;ent of a &s;ilver-hilted hanger, and a pair of pi&s;tols mounted with the &s;ame metal, which fell to his &s;hare in plundering the enemy.&mdash;We arrived &s;afely at Morant, and going on &s;hore, pitched upon an empty &s;tore-hou&s;e, which we hired for the reception of the wounded, who were brought to it next day, with beds and other nece&s;&s;aries, and four of

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A &s;trange adventure, in con&s;equence of which I am extremely happy&mdash;Crampley does me ill offices with the captain: but his malice is defeated by the good nature and friend&s;hip of the &s;urgeon&mdash;we return to Port-Royal&mdash;our captain gets the command of a larger &s;hip, and is &s;ucceeded by an old man&mdash;Brayl is provided for&mdash;we receive orders to &s;ail for England.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN my patients were all in a fair way, my com|panion and commander, who&s;e name was Brayl, carried me up the country to the hou&s;e of a rich plant|er, with whom he was acquainted; where we were &s;ump|tuou&s;ly entertained, and in the evening &s;et out on our re|turn to the &s;hip. When we had walked about a mile by moon-light, we perceived a hor&s;eman behind us, who coming up, wi&s;hed us <HI>good even,</HI> and a&s;ked which way we went. His voice, which was quite familiar to me, no &s;ooner &s;truck my ear, than, in &s;pite of all my re&s;olution and reflection, my hair bri&s;tled up, and I was &s;eized with a violent fit of trembling, which Brayl mi&s;interpreting, bade me be under no concern. I told him, he was mi&s;ta|ken in the cau&s;e of my di&s;order; and, addre&s;&s;ing my|&s;elf to the per&s;on on hor&s;eback, &s;aid, <Q>I could have &s;worn by your voice, that you was a dear friend of mine, if I had not been certain of his death.</Q>&mdash;To this addre&s;s, after &s;ome pau&s;e, he replied, <Q>There are many voices as well as faces that re&s;emble one another; but pray, what was your friend's name?</Q> I &s;atisfied him in that particular, and gave a &s;hort detail of the me|lancholy fate of Thom&s;on, not without many &s;ighs and &s;ome tears. A &s;ilence en&s;ued which la&s;ted &s;ome minutes, and then the conver&s;ation turned on different &s;ubjects, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill we arrived at a hou&s;e on the road, where the hor&s;eman alighted, and begged with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e would go in and drink a bowl of punch with him, that we could not re&s;i&s;t.&mdash;But if I was alarmed at his voice, what mu&s;t my amazement be, when I di&s;covered by the
<PB N="223" REF="027715_0230_0FD5ED30F21EC7B0">
light, the very per&s;on of my lamented friend! Perceiving my confu&s;ion, which was extreme, he cla&s;ped me in his arms, and bedewed my face with tears.&mdash;It was &s;ome time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re I recovered the u&s;e of my rea&s;on, overpowered with this event, and longer &s;till before I could &s;peak. So that all I was capable of was to return his embraces, and to mingle the overflowings of my joy with his; while hone&s;t Brayl, affected with the &s;cene, wept as fa&s;t as either of us, and &s;ignified his participation of our happine&s;s by hugging us both, and capering about the room like a madman.&mdash;At length I retrieved the u&s;e of my tongue, and cried, <Q>Is it po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;can you be my friend Thom|&s;on? No certainly: alas! he was drowned! and I am now under the deception of a dream!</Q>&mdash;He was at great pains to convince me of his being the individual per|&s;on whom I regretted, and bidding me &s;it down and com|po&s;e my&s;elf, promi&s;ed to explain his &s;udden di&s;appearance from the Thunder, and to account for his being at pre|&s;ent in the land of the living.&mdash;This ta&s;k he acquitted him&s;elf of, after I had drank a gla&s;s of punch, and re|collected my &s;pirits, by informing us, that, with a deter|mination to rid him&s;elf of a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence, he had gone in the night-time to the head, while the &s;hip was on her way, from whence he &s;lipped down as &s;oftly as he could by the bows, into the &s;ea, where, after he was hearti|ly ducked, he began to repent of his precipitation, and as he could &s;wim very well, kept him&s;elf above water, in hopes of being taken up by &s;ome of the &s;hips a-&s;tern;&mdash;that in this &s;ituation he hailed a large ve&s;&s;el, and begged to be taken in, but was an&s;wered, that &s;he was a heavy &s;ailer, and therefore they did not chu&s;e to lo&s;e time, by bringing to; however, they threw an old che&s;t over|board for his convenience, and told him that &s;ome of the &s;hips a-&s;tern would certainly &s;ave him;&mdash;that no other ve&s;|&s;el came within &s;ight or cry of him, for the &s;pace of three hours, during which time he had the mortification to find him&s;elf in the middle of the ocean alone, without other &s;upport or re&s;ting place but what a &s;ew crazy boards af|forded; till at la&s;t he di&s;cerned a &s;mall &s;loop &s;teering to|wards him, upon which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;et up his throat, and had the good fortune to be heard and re&s;cued from the dreary wa&s;te, by their boat, which was hoi&s;ted out on purpo&s;e.

"I was no &s;ooner brought on board," continued he, <Q>than I fainted, and when I recovered my &s;en&s;es, found my&s;elf in bed, regaled with a mo&s;t noi&s;ome &s;mell of onions and chee&s;e, which made me think at fir&s;t, that I was in my own hammoc along-&s;ide of hone&s;t Mor|gan, and that all which had pa&s;&s;ed was no more than a dream.&mdash;Upon inquiry I under&s;tood that I was on board of a &s;chooner belonging to Rhode-I&s;land, bound for Jamaica, with a cargo of gee&s;e, pigs, onions, and chee&s;e; and that the ma&s;ter's name was Robert&s;on, by birth a North-Briton, whom I knew at fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight to be an old &s;chool-fellow of mine.&mdash;When I di&s;covered my|&s;elf to him, he was tran&s;ported with &s;urpri&s;e and joy, and begged to know the occa&s;ion of my misfortune, which I did not think fit to di&s;clo&s;e, becau&s;e I knew his notions with regard to religion were very &s;evere and confined; therefore contented my&s;elf with telling him, I fell overboard by accident; but made no &s;cruple of ex|plaining the nature of my di&s;agreeable &s;tation, and of acquainting him with my determined purpo&s;e never to return to the Thunder man of war.&mdash;Although he was not of my opinion in that particular, knowing that I mu&s;t lo&s;e my clothes, and what pay was due to me, unle&s;s I went back to my duty; yet when I de&s;cribed the circum&s;tances of the helli&s;h life I led, under the tyrannic &s;way of Oakhum and Mac&s;hane; and among other grievances, hinted a di&s;&s;atisfaction at the irreli|gious deportment of my &s;hip-mates, and the want of the true Pre&s;byterian go&s;pel doctrine; he changed his &s;entiments, and conjured me with great vehemence and zeal to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of ri&s;ing in the navy; and that he might &s;hew how much he had my intere&s;t at heart, undertook to provide for me in &s;ome &s;hape or other, before he &s;hould leave Jamaica.&mdash;This promi&s;e he performed to my heart's de&s;ire, by recommending me to a gentleman of fortune, with whom I have lived ever &s;ince, in quality of &s;urgeon and over&s;eer to his plantations.&mdash;He and his lady are now at King&s;ton, &s;o that I am, for the pre&s;ent, ma&s;ter of this hou&s;e, to which, from my &s;oul, I bid you welcome, and hope you will favour me with your company during the re|maining part of the night.</Q>&mdash;I needed not a &s;econd

invitation; but Mr. Brayl, who was a diligent and excel|lent officer, could not be per&s;uaded to &s;leep out of the &s;hip: however, he &s;upped with us, and after having drank a chearful gla&s;s, &s;et out for the ve&s;&s;el, which was not above three miles from the place, e&s;corted by a couple of &s;tout negroes, whom Mr. Thom&s;on ordered to conduct him.&mdash;Never were two friends more happy in the conver|&s;ation of each other than we, for the time it la&s;ted: I re|lated to him the particulars of our attempt upon Cartha|gena, of which he had heard but an imperfect account; and he gratified me with a narration of every little inci|dent of his life &s;ince we parted.&mdash;He a&s;&s;ured me, it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty he could re&s;i&s;t his inclination of coming down to Port Royal to &s;ee Morgan and me, of whom he had heard no tidings &s;ince the day of our &s;epa|ration; but that he was re&s;trained by the fear of being detained as a de&s;erter.&mdash;He told me, that when he heard my voice in the dark, he was almo&s;t as much &s;urpri&s;ed as I was at &s;eeing him afterwards; and in the confidence of friend&s;hip, di&s;clo&s;ed a pa&s;&s;ion he entertained for the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he lived, who, by his de&s;cription, was a very amiable young lady, and did not di&s;dain his addre&s;&s;es; that he was very much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avoured by her parents, and did not de&s;pair of obtaining their con&s;ent to the match, which would at once render him independent of the world.&mdash;I congratulated him on his good fortune, which he prote&s;ted &s;hould never make him forget his friends; and towards morning we betook our&s;elves to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Next day he accompanied me to the &s;hip, where Mr. Brayl entertained him at dinner, and we having &s;pent the afternoon together, he took his leave of us in the even|ing, after he had forced upon me ten pi&s;toles, as a &s;mall token of his affection.&mdash;In &s;hort, while we &s;taid here, we &s;aw one another every day, and generally ate at the &s;ame table, which was plentifully &s;upplied by him with all kinds of poultry, butcher's meat, oranges, limes, lemons, pine|apples, Madeira wine, and excellent rum; &s;o that this &s;mall interval of ten days was by far the mo&s;t agreeable period of my life.</P>
<P>At length the Lizard arrived; and my patients being all &s;it for duty, they and I were ordered on board of her,
<PB N="226" REF="027715_0233_0FD5ED3918275D68">
where I under&s;tood from Mr. Tomlins, that there was a &s;hyne&s;s between the lieutenant and him on my account; that rancoro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s villain having taken the opportunity of my ab&s;ence, to fill the captain's ears with a thou&s;and &s;canda|lous &s;tories, to my prejudice; among other things affirm|ing, that I had been once tran&s;ported for theft, and that when I was in the Thunder man of war I had been whipt for the &s;ame crime.&mdash;The &s;urgeon, on the other hand, having heard my whole &s;tory from my own mouth, de|fended me &s;trenuou&s;ly, and in the cour&s;e of that good|natured office, recounted all the in&s;tances of Crampley's malice again&s;t me, while I remained on board of that &s;hip.&mdash;Which declaration, while it &s;atisfied the captain of my innocence, made the lieutenant as much my de|fender's enemy as mine. This infernal behaviour of Cramp|ley, with regard to me, added &s;uch fuel to my former re&s;entment, that at certain times I was quite be&s;ide my&s;elf with the de&s;ire of revenge, and was even tempted to pi&s;tol him on the quarter-deck, though an infamous death mu&s;t inevitably have been my reward. But the &s;urgeon, who was my confident, argued again&s;t &s;uch a de&s;perate action &s;o effectually, that I &s;tifled the flame, which con|&s;umed me, for the pre&s;ent, and re&s;olved to wait for a more convenient opportunity. In the mean time, that Mr. Tom|lins might be the more convinced of the wrongs I &s;uffered by this fellow's &s;lander, I begged he would go and vi&s;it Mr. Thom&s;on, who&s;e wonderful e&s;cape I had made him acquainted with, and inquire of him into the particulars of my conduct while he was my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ellow-mate. This reque&s;t the &s;urgeon complied with, more from a curio&s;ity to &s;ee a per&s;on who&s;e fate had been &s;o extraordinary, than to con|firm his good opinion of me, which he a&s;&s;ured me was al|ready firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed. He therefore &s;et out for the dwelling-place of my friend, with a letter of introduction from me, and, being received with all the civility and kindne&s;s I expected, returned to the &s;hip, not only &s;atis|fied with my character beyond the power of doubt or in|&s;inuation, but al&s;o charmed with the affability and conver|&s;ation of Thom&s;on, who loaded him and me with pre&s;ents of fre&s;h &s;tock, liquors, and fruit. As he would not ven|ture to come and &s;ee us on board, le&s;t Crampley &s;hould know and detain him, when the time of our departure ap|proached,
<PB N="227" REF="027715_0234_0FD5ED3AA19DF8E8">
I obtained leave to go and bid him farewel.&mdash;After we had vowed an everla&s;ting friend&s;hip, he pre&s;&s;ed upon me a pur&s;e with four doubloons, which I refu&s;ed as long as I could without giving umbrage; and, having cordially embraced each other, I returned on board, where I found a &s;mall box, with a letter directed to me, to the care of Mr. Tomlins. Knowing the &s;uper&s;cription to be of Thom&s;on's hand-writing, I opened it with &s;ome &s;ur|pri&s;e, and learned that this generous friend, not contented with loading me with the pre&s;ents already mentioned, had &s;ent, for my u&s;e and acceptance, half a dozen fine &s;hirts, and as many linen wai&s;tcoats and caps, with twelve pair of new thread-&s;tockings. Being thus provided with money, and all nece&s;&s;aries for the comfort of life, I began to look upon my&s;elf as a gentleman of &s;ome con&s;equence, and felt my pride dilate apace.</P>
<P>Next day we &s;ailed for Port-Royal, where we arrived &s;afely with our prizes, and, as there was nothing to do on board, I went a&s;hore, and, having purcha&s;ed a laced wai&s;t|coat with &s;ome other clothes at a &s;ale, made a &s;waggering figure for &s;ome days among the taverns, where I ventured to play a little at hazard, and came off with fifty pi&s;toles in my pocket. Mean while our captain was promoted to a &s;hip of twenty guns, and the command of the Lizard given to a man turned of four&s;core, who had been lieute|nant &s;ince the reign of King William, and, notwith&s;tand|ing his long &s;ervice, would have probably died in that &s;ta|tion, had he not applied &s;ome prize-money, he had lately received, to make intere&s;t with his &s;uperiors. My friend Brayl was al&s;o made an officer about the &s;ame time, after he had &s;erved in quality of mid&s;hipman and mate five and twenty years. Soon after the&s;e alterations, the admi|ral pitched upon our &s;hip to carry home di&s;patches for the mini&s;try, and we &s;et fail for England, having fir&s;t &s;crubbed her bottom, and taken in provi&s;ion and water for the oc|ca&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>We depart for Europe&mdash;a mi&s;under&s;tanding ari&s;es between the captain and &s;urgeon through the &s;candalous a&s;per&s;ions of Crampley&mdash;the captain dies&mdash;Crampley tyranni&s;es over the &s;urgeon, who falls a victim to his cruelty&mdash;I am al&s;o ill-u&s;ed&mdash;the &s;hip &s;trikes&mdash;the behaviour of Crampley and the &s;eamen on that occa&s;ion&mdash;I get on &s;hore, challenge the captain to &s;ingle combat&mdash;am treacherou&s;ly knocked down, wounded, and robbed.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOW that I could return to my native country in a creditable way, I felt exce&s;&s;ive plea&s;ure in find|ing my&s;elf out of &s;ight of that fatal i&s;land, which has been the grave of &s;o many Europeans; and, as I was accommodated with every thing to render the pa&s;&s;age agreeable, I re&s;olved to enjoy my&s;elf as much as the in&s;o|lence of Crampley would permit. This in&s;idious &s;landerer had found means already to cau&s;e a mi&s;under&s;tanding be|tween the &s;urgeon and captain, who by his age and infir|mities was rendered intolerably peevi&s;h, his di&s;po&s;ition having al&s;o been &s;oured by a long cour&s;e of di&s;appoint|ments, and had a particular aver&s;ion to all young men, e&s;pecially to &s;urgeons, whom he con&s;idered as unnece&s;&s;ary animals on board of a &s;hip. In con&s;equence of the&s;e &s;enti|ments, he never con&s;ulted the doctor, notwith&s;tanding his
<PB N="2" REF="027715_0243_0FD5ED4A5AB82620">
being &s;eized with a violent fit of the gout and gravel, but applied to a ca&s;k of Holland gin, which was his &s;overeign pre&s;cription again&s;t all di&s;tempers. But whether he was at this time too &s;paring, or took an over-do&s;e of his cor|dial, certain it is, he departed in the night without any ceremony, (which indeed was a thing he always de&s;pi&s;ed&punc;) and was found &s;tiff next morning, to the no &s;mall &s;atis|faction of Crampley, who &s;ucceeded to the command of the ve&s;&s;el. For that very rea&s;on Mr. Tomlins and I had no cau&s;e to rejoice at this event, fearing that the tyranny of our new commander would now be as unlimited as his power. The fir&s;t day of his command ju&s;tified our appre|hen&s;ion; for&punc; on pretence that the decks were too much crowded, he ordered the &s;urgeon's hencoops, with all his fowls, to be thrown over-board, and at the &s;ame time pro|hibited him and me from appearing on the quarter-deck. Mr. Tomlins could not help complaining of the&s;e injuries, and in the cour&s;e of his expo&s;tulation dropped &s;ome ha&s;ty words, of which Crampley taking hold, confined him to his cabin, where in a few days, for want of air, he was attacked by a fever, which &s;oon put an end to his life, after having made his will, by which he bequeathed all his e&s;tate, per&s;onal and real, to his &s;i&s;ter, and le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to me his watch and in&s;truments as remembrances of his friend&s;hip. I was penetrated with grief on this melancholy occa&s;ion, the more becau&s;e there was nobody on board to whom I could communicate my griefs, or of whom I could receive the lea&s;t con&s;olation or advice. Crampley was &s;o far from di&s;covering the lea&s;t remor&s;e for his barbarity, at the news of the &s;urgeon's death, that he in&s;ulted his memory in the mo&s;t abu&s;ive manner, and affirmed he had poi&s;oned him&s;elf out of pure fear, dreading to be brought to a court-mar|tial for mutiny; for which rea&s;on he would not &s;uffer the &s;ervice of the dead to be read over his body before it was thrown over-board.</P>
<P>Nothing but a &s;peedy deliverance could have &s;upported me under the brutal &s;way of this ba&s;haw, who, to render my life the more irk&s;ome, &s;ignified to my me&s;s-mates a de&s;ire that I &s;hould be expelled from their &s;ociety. This was no &s;ooner hinted than they granted his reque&s;t, and I was fain to eat in a &s;olitary manner by my&s;elf during the re&s;t of the pa&s;&s;age, which, however, &s;oon drew to a period.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="027715_0244_0FD5ED4C982945B0">
We had been &s;even weeks at &s;ea, when the gunner told the captain, that by his reckoning we mu&s;t be in &s;ound|ings, and de&s;ired he would order the lead to be heaved. Crampley &s;wore he did not know how to keep the &s;hip's way, for we were not within a hundred leagues of &s;ound|ings, and therefore he would not give him&s;elf the trouble to ca&s;t the lead. Accordingly we continued our cour&s;e all that afternoon and night, without &s;hortening &s;ail, though the gunner pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ended to di&s;cover Scilly light, and next morning prote&s;ted in form again&s;t the captain's conduct; for which he was put in confinement. We di&s;covered no land all that day, and Crampley was &s;till &s;o infatuated as to neglect &s;ounding: but at three o'clock in the morning the &s;hip &s;truck, and remained fa&s;t on a &s;and-bank. This accident alarmed the whole crew; the boat was immedi|ately hoi&s;ted out; but, as we could not di&s;cern which way the &s;hore lay, we were obliged to wait for day-light&punc; In the mean time the wind increa&s;ed, and the waves beat again&s;t the &s;loop with &s;uch violence, that we expected &s;he would have gone to pieces. The gunner was relea&s;ed and con&s;ulted: he advi&s;ed the captain to cut away her ma&s;t, in order to lighten her; this was performed without &s;ucce&s;s: the &s;ailors, &s;eeing things in a de&s;perate &s;ituation, accord|ing to cu&s;tom, broke up the che&s;ts belonging to the offi|cers, dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in their clothes, drank their liquors without ceremony; and drunkenne&s;s, tumult, and confu|&s;ion en&s;ued. In the mid&s;t of this uproar I went below to &s;ecure my own effects, and found the carpenter's mate hewing down the pur&s;er's cabin with his hatchet, whi&s;tling all the while with great compo&s;ure. When I a&s;ked his intention in &s;o doing, he replied very calmly, <Q>I only want to ta&s;te the pur&s;er's rum; that's all, ma&s;ter.</Q>&mdash;At that in&s;tant the pur&s;er, coming down, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d &s;eeing his effects going to wreck, complained bitterly of the inju&s;tice done to him, and a&s;ked the fellow what occa&s;ion he had for liquor, when in all likelihood he would be in eternity in a few minutes?&mdash;"All's one for that," &s;aid the plun|derer; "let us live while we can."&mdash;<Q>Mi&s;erable wretch that thou art!</Q> cried the pur&s;er, <Q>what mu&s;t be thy lot in the other world, if thou die&s;t in the commi&s;&s;ion of robbery?</Q>&mdash;"Why hell, I &s;uppo&s;e," replied the other with great deliberation; while the pur&s;er fell on his
<PB N="4" REF="027715_0245_0FD5ED5119AD2690">
knees, and begged of Heaven that we might not all peri&s;h for the &s;ake of one Jonas. During this dialogue I clothed my&s;elf in my be&s;t apparel, girded on my hanger, &s;tuck my pi&s;tols loaded in my belt, di&s;po&s;ed of all my valuable moveables about my per&s;on, and came upon deck with a re&s;olution of taking the fir&s;t opportunity to get on &s;hore, which, when the day broke, appeared at the di&s;tance of three miles a-head. Crampley, finding his efforts to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the &s;hip off ineffectual, determined to con&s;ult his own &s;afety by going into the boat, which he had no &s;ooner done than the &s;hip's company followed &s;o fa&s;t, that &s;he would have &s;unk along-&s;ide, had not &s;ome one wi&s;er than the re&s;t cut the rope, and put off. But, before this happened, I had made &s;everal attempts to get in, and was always baulked by the captain, who was &s;o eager for excluding me, that he did not mind the endeavours of any other body. Enraged at this inhuman partiality, and &s;eeing the rope cut, I pulled one of my pi&s;tols from my belt, and, cocking it, &s;wore I would &s;hoot any man who would pre|&s;ume to ob&s;truct my entrance. So &s;aying, I leaped with my full exertion, and got on board the boat with the lo&s;s of the &s;kin off one of my &s;hins. I chanced in my de&s;cent to overturn Crampley, who no &s;ooner got up than he &s;truck at me &s;everal times with a cutla&s;s, and ordered the men to throw me over-board; but they were too anxious about their own &s;afety to mind what he &s;aid. Though the boat was very deeply loaded, and the &s;ea terribly high, we made &s;hift to get upon dry land in le&s;s than an hour after we parted from the &s;loop. As &s;oon as I &s;et foot on <HI>terra firma,</HI> my indignation which had boiled &s;o long within me, broke out again&s;t Crampley, whom I immediately challenged to &s;ingle combat, pre&s;enting my pi&s;tols that he might take his choice; he took one without he&s;itation, and, before I could cock the other, fired in my face, throwing the pi&s;tol after the &s;hot. I felt my&s;elf &s;tunned, and, imagining the bullet had entered my brain, di&s;char|ged mine as quick as po&s;&s;ible, that I might not die unre|venged; then, flying upon my antagoni&s;t, I knocked out &s;everal of his fore-teeth with the but-end of the piece, and would certainly have made an end of him with that in&s;trument, had he not di&s;engaged him&s;elf, and &s;eized his cutla&s;s, which he had given to his &s;ervant when he received
<PB N="5" REF="027715_0246_0FD5ED529E4B3408">
the pi&s;tol. Seeing him armed in this manner, I drew my hanger, and having flung my pi&s;tol at his head, clo|&s;ed with him in a tran&s;port of &s;ury, and thru&s;t my wea|pon into his mouth, which it enlarged on one &s;ide to his ear. Whether the &s;mart of this wound di&s;concerted him, or the unevenne&s;s of the ground made him reel, I know not, but he &s;taggered &s;ome paces back: I followed clo&s;e, and with one &s;troke cut the tendons on the back of his hand, upon which his cutla&s;s dropt, and he remained de|fencele&s;s.&mdash;I know not with what cruelty my rage might have in&s;pired me, if I had not at that in&s;tant been felled to the ground by a blow on the back part of my head, which deprived me of all &s;en&s;ation.&mdash;When I recovered the u&s;e of my under&s;tanding, I found my&s;elf alone in a de&s;olate place, &s;tript of my clothes, money, watch, buckles, and every thing but my &s;hoes, &s;tockings, breeches, and &s;hirt.&mdash;What a di&s;covery mu&s;t this be to me, who, but an hour before, was worth &s;ixty guineas in ca&s;h! I cur&s;ed the hour of my birth, the parents that gave me being, the &s;ea that did not &s;wallow me up, the poinard of the ene|my, which could not find the way to my heart, the villainy of tho&s;e who had left me in that mi&s;erable condi|tion, and in the ectacy of de&s;pair, re&s;olved to lie &s;till where I was and peri&s;h.</P>

There being a very good &s;uit of livery in the hou&s;e, which had belonged to my predece&s;&s;or, decea&s;ed, I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in it, and found it fit me exactly, &s;o that there was no occa&s;ion for employing a tailor on that account.&mdash;I had not been long equipped in this manner, when my lady's bell rung; upon which I ran up &s;tairs, and found her &s;talking about the room in her &s;hift and under-petti|coat only; I would have immediately retired, as became me, but &s;he bid me come in, and air a clean &s;hift for her; which having done with &s;ome backwardne&s;s, &s;he put it on before me without any ceremony, and I verily believe was ignorant of my &s;ex all the time, being quite ab&s;orbed in contemplation.&mdash;About four o'clock in the afternoon, I was ordered to lay the cloth and place two covers, which I under&s;tood was for my mi&s;tre&s;s and her niece, whom I had not as yet &s;een.&mdash;Though I was not very dextrous at this operation, I performed it pretty well for a beginner&punc; and when dinner was upon the table, &s;aw my mi&s;tre&s;s ap|proach, accompanied by the young lady, who&s;e name for

a&s;&s;ented, with a compliment to my inder&s;tanding in the &s;ame language, that flattered my vanity extremely.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation, among other &s;ubjects, turned upon the young '&s;quire, whom my lady enquired after under the title of the Savage; and was informed by her niece, that he was &s;till in bed, repairing the fatigue of la&s;t night's debauch, and recruiting &s;trength and &s;pirits to undergo a &s;ox-cha&s;e to-morrow morning, in company with Sir Ti|mothy Thicket, 'Squire Bumper, and a great many other gentlemen of the &s;ame &s;tamp, whom he had invited on that occa&s;ion; &s;o that by day-break the whole hou&s;e would be in an uproar.&mdash;This was a very di&s;agreeable piece of news to the <HI>virtuo&s;o,</HI> who prote&s;ted &s;he would &s;tuff her ears with cotton when &s;he went to bed, and take a do&s;e of opium to make her &s;leep the more &s;ound, that &s;he might not be di&s;turbed and di&s;tracted by the clamour of the brutes.</P>
<P>When their dinner was over, I and my fellow-&s;ervants &s;at down to ours in the kitchen, where I under&s;tood that Sir Timothy Thicket was a wealthy knight in the neigh|bourhood, between whom and Narci&s;&s;a a match had been projected by her brother, who propo&s;ed at the &s;ame time to e&s;pou&s;e Sir Timothy's &s;i&s;ter, by which means, as their fortunes were pretty equal, the young ladies would be provided for and their brothers be never the poorer; but the ladies did not concur in the &s;cheme, each of them en|tertaining a hearty contempt for the per&s;on allotted to her for a hu&s;band by this agreement. This information begat in me a mortal aver&s;ion to Sir Timothy, whom I looked upon as my rival, and cur&s;ed in my heart for his pre&s;umption. Next morning by day-break, being awakened by the noi&s;e of the hunters and hounds, I got up to view the cavalcade, and had a &s;ight of my competitor, who&s;e accompli&s;hments (the e&s;tate excluded) did not &s;eem bril|liant enough to give me much unea&s;ine&s;s with re&s;pect to Narci&s;&s;a, who, I flattered my&s;elf, was not to be won by &s;uch qualifications as he was ma&s;ter of, either as to per&s;on or mind. My mi&s;tre&s;s, notwith&s;tanding her precaution, was &s;o much di&s;turbed by her nephew's company, that &s;he did not ri&s;e till five o'clock in the afternoon: &s;o that I had an opportunity of examining her &s;tudy at lei&s;ure, to which I was &s;trongly prompted by my curio&s;ity. Here I

&s;ound a thou&s;and &s;craps of her own poetry, con&s;i&s;ting of three, four, ten, twelve, and twenty lines, on an infinity of &s;ubjects, which, as whim in&s;pired, &s;he had begun, with|out con&s;tancy or capacity to bring to any degree of com|po&s;ition: but, what was very extraordinary in a female poet, there was not the lea&s;t mention made of love in any of her performances. I counted fragments of five tragedies, the titles of which were, <Q>The &s;tern Philo&s;opher&mdash;The double Murder&mdash;The &s;acrilegious Traitor&mdash;The Fall of Lucifer&mdash;and the La&s;t Day</Q>&mdash;From whence I gather|ed, that her di&s;po&s;ition was gloomy, and her imagination delighted with objects of horror. Her library was com|po&s;ed of the be&s;t Engli&s;h hi&s;torians, poets, and philo&s;o|phers, of all the French critics and poets, and of a few books in Italian, chiefly poetry, at the head of which were Ta&s;&s;o and Ario&s;to, pretty much u&s;ed&mdash;be&s;ides the&s;e, tran&s;lations of the cla&s;&s;ics into French, but not one book in Greek or Latin; a circum&s;tance that di&s;covered her ignorance of the&s;e languages. After having taken a full view of this collection I retired, and at the u&s;ual time was preparing to lay the cloth, when I was told by the maid, that her mi&s;tre&s;s was &s;till in bed, and had been &s;o affected with the notes of the hounds in the morning, that &s;he ac|tually believed her&s;elf a hare be&s;et with the hunters, and begged a few greens to munch for her breakfa&s;t. When I te&s;tified my &s;urpri&s;e at this unaccountable imagination, &s;he let me know that her lady was very much &s;ubject to whims of this nature, &s;ometimes fancying her&s;elf an ani|mal, &s;ometimes a piece of furniture, during which conceit|ed transformations it was very dangerous to come near her, e&s;pecially when &s;he repre&s;ented a bea&s;t; for that lately, in the character of a cat, &s;he had flown at her, and &s;cratched h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r face in a terrible manner&mdash;that &s;ome months ago &s;he prophe&s;ied a general conflagration was at hand, and no|thing would be able to quench it but her water, which, therefore, &s;he kept &s;o long that her life was in danger, and &s;he mu&s;t needs have died of the retention, had they not found an expedient to make her evacuate, by kindling a bonfire under her chamber-window, and per&s;uaded her that the hou&s;e was in flames; upon which, with great de|liberation, &s;he bid them bring all the tubs and ve&s;&s;els they could find, to be filled for the pre&s;ervation of the hou&s;e,.

into one of which &s;he immediately di&s;charged the cau&s;e of her di&s;temper.

When I ap|peared, &s;he &s;tarted up with an alarmed look, and &s;prung to the other &s;ide of the room to avoid me, whom, without doubt, &s;he mi&s;took for a beagle thir&s;ting after her life.&mdash;Perceiving her extreme confu&s;ion, I retired, and on the &s;tair-ca&s;e met the adorable Narci&s;&s;a coming up, to whom I imparted the &s;ituation of my mi&s;tre&s;s: &s;he &s;aid not a word, but, &s;miling with un&s;peakable grace, went into her aunt's apartment, and in a little time my ears were ravi&s;h|ed with the effects of her &s;kill.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>DURING this &s;ea&s;on of love and tranquillity, my mu&s;e which had lain dormant &s;o long, awoke, and pro|duced &s;everal &s;mall performances on the &s;ubject of my flame: but, as it concerned me nearly to remain undi&s;co|vered in my real character and &s;entiments, I was under a nece&s;&s;ity of mortifying my de&s;ire of prai&s;e, by confining my works to my own peru&s;al and applau&s;e. In the mean time I &s;trove to in&s;inuate my&s;elf into the good opinion of both ladies, and &s;ucceeded &s;o well by my diligence and dutiful behaviour, that in a little time I was at lea&s;t a fa|vourite &s;ervant, and frequently enjoyed the plea&s;ure of hearing my&s;elf mentioned in French and Italian with &s;ome degree of warmth and &s;urprize, by the deare&s;t object of all my wi&s;hes, as a per&s;on who had &s;o much of the gentleman in my appearance and di&s;cour&s;e, that &s;he could not for her &s;oul treat me like a common lacquey. My prudence and mode&s;ty were not long proof again&s;t the&s;e bewitching com|pliments. One day, while I waited at dinner, the con|ver&s;ation turned upon a knotty pa&s;&s;age of Ta&s;&s;o's Gieru|&s;alem, which it &s;eems had puzzled them both. After a great many un&s;atisfactory conjectures, my mi&s;tre&s;s, taking the book out of her pocket, turned to the place in que&s;ti|on, and read the &s;entence over and over without &s;ucce&s;s; at length, de&s;pairing of finding the author's meaning, &s;he turned to me, &s;aying, <Q>Come hither, Bruno; let us &s;ee what fortune will do for us: I will interpret to thee what goes before and what follows in this ob&s;cure pa|ragraph, the particular words of which I will al&s;o ex|plain, that thou may'&s;t, by comparing one with the

other, gue&s;s the &s;en&s;e of that which perplexes us.</Q> I was too vain to let &s;lip this opportunity of di&s;playing my talents&punc; therefore, without he&s;itation, read and explained the whole of that which had di&s;concerted them, to the ut|ter a&s;toni&s;hment of both. Narci&s;&s;a's face and lovely neck were over&s;pread with blu&s;hes, from which I drew a favour|able omen, while her aunt, after having &s;tared at me a good while with a look of amazement, exclaimed, <Q>In the name of Heaven, who art thou?</Q>&mdash;I told her I had picked up a &s;mattering of Italian during a voyage up the Straits. At this &s;he &s;hook her head, and ob&s;erved, that no &s;matterer could read as I had done. She then de|&s;ired to know if I under&s;tood French, to which I an&s;wered in the affirmative: &s;he a&s;ked if I was acquainted with the Latin and Greek; I replied, "A little."&mdash;"O ho!" continued &s;he, <Q>and with philo&s;ophy and mathematics, I &s;uppo&s;e?</Q>&mdash;I owned I knew &s;omething of each&mdash;whereupon &s;he repeated her &s;tare and interrogation. I be|gan to repent my vanity, and, in order to repair the fault I had committed, &s;aid, it was not to be wondered at if I had a tolerable education, becau&s;e learning was &s;o cheap in my country, that every pea&s;ant was a &s;cholar; but I hoped her lady&s;hip would think my under&s;tanding no ex|ception to my character. She was plea&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o an&s;wer, <Q>No, no, God forbid.</Q> But, during the re&s;t of the time they &s;at at table, they behaved with remarkable re&s;erve.</P>
<P>This alteration ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> me much unea&s;ine&s;s, and I pa&s;&s;ed the night without &s;leep, in melancholy reflections on the vanity of young men, which prompts them to commit &s;o many fooli&s;h actions, contrary to their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ober judg|ment. Next day, however, in&s;tead of profiting by this &s;elf-condemnation, I yielded &s;till more to the dictates of the principle I had endeavoured to cha&s;ti&s;e, and, if fortune had not be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">riended me more than prudence could expect, I &s;hould have been treated with the contempt I de&s;erved. After breakfa&s;t, my lady, who was a true author, bid me follow her into the &s;tudy, where &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf thus: <Q>Since you are &s;o learned, you cannot be void of ta&s;te; therefore I am to de&s;ire your opinion of a &s;mall per|formance in poetry, which I lately compo&s;ed. You mu&s;t know I have planned a tragedy, the &s;ubject of which &s;hall be the murder of a prince before the altar,
<PB N="21" REF="027715_0262_0FD5CD8E4026E508">
where he is bu&s;y at his devotions. After the deed is perpetrated, the regicide will harangue the people, with the bloody dagger in his hand, and I have already com|po&s;ed a &s;peech, which I think will &s;uit the character extremely&mdash;Here it is.</Q> Then, taking up a &s;crap of paper, &s;he read, with violent empha&s;is and ge&s;ture, as fol|lows:
<Q><L>Thus have I &s;ent the &s;imple king to hell,</L>
<L>Without or coffin, &s;hroud, or pa&s;&s;ing-bell:</L>
<L>To me, what are divine and human laws?</L>
<L>I court no &s;anction but my own applau&s;e!</L>
<L>Rapes, robb'ries, trea&s;on, yield my &s;oul delight!</L>
<L>And human carnage gratifies my &s;ight.</L>
<L>I drag the parent by the hoary hair,</L>
<L>And to&s;s the &s;prawling infant on my &s;pear,</L>
<L>While the fond mother's cries regale mine ear.</L>
<L>I fight, I vanqui&s;h, murder friends and foes;</L>
<L>Nor dare th' immortal gods my rage oppo&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>Though I did great violence to my under&s;tanding in prai&s;ing this unnatural rhap&s;ody, I neverthele&s;s extolled it as a production that of it&s;elf de&s;erved immortal fame, and be&s;ought her lady&s;hip to ble&s;s the world with the fruits of tho&s;e uncommon talents Heaven had be&s;towed upon her. She &s;miled with a look of &s;elf-complacency, and, encou|raged by the incen&s;e I had offered, communicated all her poetical works, which I applauded one by one with as lit|tle candour as I had &s;hewn at fir&s;t. Satiated with my flat|tery, which I hope my &s;ituation ju&s;tified, &s;he could not in con&s;cience refu&s;e me an opportunity of &s;hining in my turn; and therefore, after a compliment to my nice di&s;cernment and ta&s;te, ob&s;erved, that doubtle&s;s I mu&s;t have produced &s;omething in that way my&s;elf, which &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee. This was a temptation I could by no means re&s;i&s;t. I owned that, while I was at college, I wrote &s;ome &s;mall detached pieces at the de&s;ire of a friend who was in love, and, at her reque&s;t, repeated the following ver&s;es, which indeed my love for Narci&s;&s;a had in&s;pired.</P>

<P>Whether or not Narci&s;&s;a di&s;covered my pa&s;&s;ion, I could not learn from her behaviour, which, though always be|nevolent to me, was henceforth more re&s;erved, and le&s;s chearful. While my thoughts a&s;pired to a &s;phere &s;o far above me, I had unwittingly made a conque&s;t of the cook|wench and the dairy-maid, who became <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o jealous of one another, that, if their &s;entiments had been refined by edu|cation, it is probable one or other of them would have had recour&s;e to poi&s;on or &s;teel, to be revenged of her ri|val; but, as their minds were happily adapted to their humble &s;tation, their mutual enmity was confined to &s;cold|ing and fifty cuffs, in which exerci&s;e they were both well-&s;killed. My good fortune did not long remain a &s;ecret, being di&s;clo&s;ed by the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">quent broils of the&s;e heroines, who kept no decorum in their encounters. The coachman and gardener, who paid their devoirs to my admirers, each to his re&s;pective choice, alarmed at my &s;ucce&s;s, laid their heads together, in order to concert a plan of revenge; and the former having been educated at the academy of Tottenham&mdash;court, undertook to challenge me to &s;ingle combat; he accordingly, with many opprobrious invec|tives, bid me defiance, and offered to box with me for twenty guineas. I told him, that, although I believed my&s;elf a match for him even at that work, I would not de&s;cend &s;o far below the dignity of a gentleman as to
<PB N="24" REF="027715_0265_0FD5ED7DAF24C960">
fight like a porter; but, if he had any thing to &s;ay to me, I was his man at blunderbu&s;s, mu&s;ket, pi&s;tol, &s;word, hatchet, &s;pit, cleaver, fork, or needle&mdash;nay more, that if he gave his tongue any more &s;aucy liberties at my ex|pence, I would crop his ears without any ceremony. This rodomontade, delivered with a &s;tern countenance and re|&s;olute tone, had the de&s;ired effect upon my antagoni&s;t, who with &s;ome confu&s;ion &s;neaked off, and gave his friend an account of his reception. The &s;tory taking air among the &s;ervants, procured for me the title of <HI>gentleman John,</HI> with which I was &s;ometimes honoured even by my mi&s;tre&s;s and Narci&s;&s;a, who had been informed of the whole affair by the chambermaid. In the mean time the rival queens expre&s;&s;ed their pa&s;&s;ion by all the means in their power: the cook entertained me with choice bits, the dairy-maid with &s;troakings: the fir&s;t would often encourage me to declare my&s;elf, by complimenting me upon my courage and learn|ing, ob&s;erving, that, if &s;he had a hu&s;band like me to maintain order, and keep accounts, &s;he could make a great deal of money by &s;etting up an eating-hou&s;e at Lon|don for gentlemen's &s;ervants on board-wages: the other courted my affection by &s;hewing her own importance, and telling me, that many a &s;ub&s;tantial farmer in the neigh|bourhood would be glad to marry her; but &s;he was re&s;ol|ved to plea&s;e her eye, if &s;he &s;hould plague her heart&mdash;then &s;he would launch out into the prai&s;e of my proper per&s;on, and &s;ay, &s;he was &s;ure I would make a good hu&s;band; for I was very good-natured. I began to be unea&s;y at the importunities of the&s;e inamoratoes, whom at another time perhaps I might have plea&s;ed, without the di&s;agreeable &s;auce of matrimony; but at pre&s;ent my whole &s;oul was engro&s;&s;ed by Narci&s;&s;a, and I could not bear the thoughts of doing any thing derogatory of the pa&s;&s;ion I entertained for her.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Narci&s;&s;a, being in danger from the brutality of Sir Timothy, is re&s;cued by me, who revenge my&s;elf on my rival&mdash;I de|clare my pa&s;&s;ion, and retreat to the &s;ea-&s;ide&mdash;I am &s;ur|rounded by &s;mugglers, and carried to Bologne&mdash;I find my uncle Lieutenant Bowling in great di&s;tre&s;s, and relieve him&mdash;our conver&s;ation.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT certain intervals my ambition would revive; I would de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf for my tame re&s;ignation to my &s;ordid fate, and revolve an hundred &s;chemes for a&s;&s;uming the cha|racter of a gentleman, to which I was entitled by birth and education. In the&s;e fruitle&s;s &s;ugge&s;tions time &s;tole away unperceived, and I had already remained eight months in the &s;tation of a footman, when an accident hap|pened that put an end to my &s;ervitude, and for the pre&s;ent bani&s;hed all hopes of &s;ucc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eding in my love.</P>
<P>Narci&s;&s;a went one day to vi&s;it Mi&s;s Thicket, who lived with her brother, within le&s;s than a mile of our hou&s;e, and was per&s;uaded to walk home in the cool of the even|ing, accompanied by Sir Timothy, who, having a good deal of the brute in him, was in&s;tigated to u&s;e &s;ome unbe|coming familiarities with her, encouraged by the &s;olitarine&s;s of a field through which they pa&s;&s;ed. The lovely creature was incen&s;ed at his rude behaviour, for which &s;he reproach|ed him in &s;uch a manner, that he lo&s;t all regard to decen|cy, and actually offered violence to this pattern of inno|cence and beauty. But Heaven would not &s;uffer &s;o much goodne&s;s to be violated, and &s;ent me (who, pa&s;&s;ing by ac|cident near the place, was alarmed with her cries) to her &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cour.&mdash;What were the emotions of my &s;oul, when I beheld Narci&s;&s;a almo&s;t &s;inking beneath the brutal force of this &s;atyr! I flew like lightning to her re&s;cue, which he perceiving, quitted his prey, and drew his hanger to cha|&s;ti&s;e my pre&s;umption. My indignation was too high to admit one thought of fear; &s;o that, ru&s;hing upon him, I &s;truck his weapon out of his hand, and u&s;ed my cudgel &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that he fell to the ground, and lay, to all ap|pearance, without &s;en&s;e. Then I turned to Narci&s;&s;a, who had &s;wooned; and, &s;itting down by her, gently rai&s;ed her
<PB N="26" REF="027715_0267_0FD5ED805D147D10">
head, and &s;upported it on my bo&s;om, while, with one hand around her wai&s;t, I kept her in that po&s;ition. My &s;oul was thrilled with tumultuous joy at feeling the object of my deare&s;t wi&s;hes within my arms, and, while &s;he lay in&s;en&s;ible, I could not refrain from applying my cheek to her's, and ravi&s;hing a ki&s;s: in a little time the blood be|gan to revi&s;it her face, &s;he opened her enchanting eyes, and, having recollected her late &s;ituation, &s;aid with a look full of tender acknowledgment, <Q>Dear John, I am en|tirely obliged to you!</Q> So &s;aying, &s;he made an effort to ri&s;e, in which I a&s;&s;i&s;ted her, and &s;he proceeded to the hou&s;e, leaning upon me all the way. I was a thou&s;and times tempted by this opportunity to declare my pa&s;&s;ion, but the dread of di&s;obliging her re&s;trained my tongue. We had not got a hundred paces from the &s;cene of her di&s;tre&s;s, when I perceived Sir Timothy get up and move homeward; a circum&s;tance which, though it gave me &s;ome &s;atisfaction, in as much as I thereby knew I had not killed him, filled me with ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion of his re&s;entment, which I found my&s;elf in no condition to with&s;tand, e&s;pe|cially when I con&s;idered his intimacy with our &s;quire, to whom I knew he could ea&s;ily ju&s;tify him&s;elf for what he had done, by imputing it to his love, and de&s;iring his brother Bruin to take the &s;ame liberty with his &s;i&s;ter, with|ont any fear of offence. When we arrived at the hou&s;e, Nar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;&s;a a&s;&s;ured me &s;he would exert all her influence in protecting me from the revenge of Thicket, and likewi&s;e engage her aunt in my favour&mdash;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ame time pulling out her pur&s;e, offered it as a &s;mall con&s;ideration for the &s;ervice I had done her; but I &s;tood too much upon the punctilios of love to incur the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of being mercenary, and refu&s;ed the pre&s;ent, &s;aying. I had merited nothing by barely doing my duty. She &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed at my di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and blu&s;hed; I felt the &s;ame &s;uf|fu&s;ion, and with a downca&s;t eye, and broken accent, told her I had one reque&s;t to make, which if her genero&s;ity would grant, I &s;hould think my&s;elf fully recompen&s;ed for an age of mi&s;ery. She changed colour at this preamble, and with great confu&s;ion replied, &s;he hoped my good &s;en&s;e would hinder me from a&s;king any thing &s;he was bound in honour to refu&s;e, and therefore bid m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ignify my de&s;ire: upon which I kneeled, and begged to ki&s;s her hand. She

immediately, and with an averted look, &s;tretched it out; I imprinted on it an ardent ki&s;s, and, bathing it with my tears, cried, <Q>Dear Madam, I am an unfortunate gen|tleman who love you to di&s;traction, but would have died a thou&s;and deaths rather than make this declaration under &s;uch a &s;ervile appearance, were he not determined to yield to the rigour of his fate, to fly from your be|witching pre&s;ence, and bury his pre&s;umptuous pa&s;&s;ion in eternal &s;ilence.</Q>&mdash;With the&s;e words, I ro&s;e up and went away before &s;he could recover &s;pirits &s;o far as to make any reply. My fir&s;t care was to go and con&s;ult Mrs. Sage|ly, with whom I had maintained a friendly corre&s;pondence ever &s;ince I left her hou&s;e. When &s;he under&s;tood my &s;itu|ation, the good woman with real concern condoled me on my unhappy fate, and approved of my re&s;olution to leave the country, being perfectly well acquainted with the bar|barous di&s;po&s;ition of my rival, "who by this time," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>has no doubt meditated a &s;cheme of revenge. In|deed, I cannot &s;ee how you will be able to elude his vengeance; being him&s;elf in the commi&s;&s;ion, he will immediately grant warrants for apprehending you; and, as almo&s;t all the people of this country are dependent on him or his friend, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for you to find &s;helter among them: if you &s;hould be apprehended, he will commit you to jail, where you may po&s;&s;ibly lan|gui&s;h in great mi&s;ery till the next a&s;&s;izes, and then be tran&s;ported for a&s;&s;aulting a magi&s;trate.</Q> While &s;he thus warned me of my danger, we heard a knocking at the door, which threw us both into great con&s;ternation, as in all probability it was occa&s;ioned by my pur&s;uers; whereupon this generous old lady, putting two guineas into my hand, with tears in her eyes bid me, for God's &s;ake, get out at the back-door, and con&s;ult my &s;afety as Providence &s;hould direct me. There was no time for de|liberation.</P>
<P>I followed her advice, and e&s;caped by the benefit of a dark night to the &s;ea-&s;ide, where, while I ruminated on my next excur&s;ion, I was all of a &s;udden &s;urrounded by armed men, who, having bound my hands and feet, bid me make no noi&s;e on pain of being &s;hot, and carried me on board of a ve&s;&s;el, which I &s;oon perceived to be a &s;mug|gling cutter. This di&s;covery gave me &s;ome &s;atisfaction at
<PB N="28" REF="027715_0269_0FD5ED84D98B8D00">
fir&s;t, becau&s;e I concluded my&s;elf &s;afe from the re&s;entment of Sir Timothy; but when I found my&s;elf in the hands of ruffians, who threatened to execute me for a &s;py, I would have thought my&s;elf happily quit for a year's impri&s;on|ment, or even tran&s;portation. It was in vain for me to prote&s;t my innocence; I could not per&s;uade them, that I had taken a &s;olitary walk to their haunt, at &s;uch an hour, merely for my own amu&s;ement, and I did not think it my intere&s;t to di&s;clo&s;e the true cau&s;e of my retreat, becau&s;e I was afraid they would have made their peace with ju&s;tice by &s;urrendering me to the penalty of the law. What con|firmed their &s;u&s;picion, was the appearance of a cu&s;tom|hou&s;e yacht, which gave them chace, and had well nigh made a prize of their ve&s;&s;el; when they were delivered from their fears by a thick fog, which effectually &s;creened them, and favoured their arrival at Bologne. But, before they got out of &s;ight of their pur&s;uer, they held a coun|cil of war about me, whom &s;ome of the mo&s;t ferocious among them would have thrown over-board as a traitor who had betrayed them to their enemies; but others, more con&s;iderate, alledged, that if they put me to death, and &s;hould afterwards be taken, they could expect no mercy from the legi&s;lature, which would never pardon outlawry aggravated by murder. It was therefore determined by a plurality of votes, that I &s;hould be &s;et on &s;hore in France, and left to find my pa&s;&s;age back to England as I &s;hould think proper, which would be puni&s;hment &s;ufficient for the bare &s;u&s;picion of a crime in it&s;elf not capital. Although this favourable determination gave me great plea&s;ure, the apprehen&s;ion of being robbed would not &s;uffer me to be perfectly at ea&s;e: to prevent this calamity, as &s;oon as I was untied in con&s;equence of the afore&s;aid deci&s;ion, I tore a &s;mall hole in one of my &s;tockings, into which I dropped <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix guineas, re&s;erving half a piece and &s;ome &s;ilver in my pocket, that, finding &s;omething, they might not be tempt|ed to make any farther inquiry. This was a very nece&s;&s;ary precaution; &s;or, when we came in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of the French &s;hore, one of the &s;mugglers told me I mu&s;t pay for my pa&s;&s;age. To this I replied, that my pa&s;&s;age was none of my own &s;eeking, therefore they could not expect a re|ward from me for tran&s;porting me into a &s;trange country by force.&mdash;"Damme!" &s;aid the outlaw, <Q>none of your

I was fain to put up with the bargain, which was by no means fa|vourable to me; and a little while after we went all on &s;hore tog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">r.</P>
<P>I re&s;olved to take my leave of the&s;e de&s;peradoes with|out much ceremony, when one of them cautioned me again&s;t appearing to their prejudice, if ever I returned to England, unle&s;s I had a mind to be murdered, for which &s;ervice, he a&s;&s;ured me, the gang never wanted agents.&mdash;I promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve his advice, and departed for the Upper Town, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e I enquired for a carbaret or public hou&s;e, into which I went with an intention of taking &s;ome refre&s;hment. In the kitchen, five Dutch &s;ailors &s;at at breakfa&s;t, with a large loaf, a firkin of butter, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of brandy on the table, the bung of which they often applied to their mouths with great per&s;everance and &s;ati&s;|faction. At &s;ome di&s;tance from them, I perceived ano|ther per&s;on in the &s;ame garb, &s;itting in a pen&s;ive, &s;olita|ry manner, entertaining him&s;elf with a whiff of tobacco, from the &s;tump of a pipe as black as jet. The appearance of di&s;tre&s;s never failed to attract my regard and compa&s;|&s;ion; I approached this forlorn tar, with a view to offer him my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and notwith&s;tanding the alteration of dre&s;s, and di&s;gui&s;e of a long beard, I di&s;covered in him my long lo&s;t and lamented uncle and benefactor, Liente|nant Bowling! Good Heaven! what were the agitations of my &s;oul, between the joy of finding again &s;uch a valu|able friend, and the &s;orrow of &s;eeing him in &s;uch a low condition! The tears gu&s;hed down my cheeks, I &s;tood motionle&s;s and &s;ilent for &s;ome time; at length, recovering the u&s;e of &s;peech, exclaimed, <Q>Gracious God!

After &s;ome pau&s;e, he went on thus: <Q>And yet, my lad, I am &s;orry to &s;ee you under &s;uch colours; the more &s;o, as it is not in my power, at pre&s;ent, to change them for the better, times being very hard with me.</Q>&mdash;With the&s;e words I could perceive a tear trickle down his furrowed cheeks, which affected me &s;o much, that I wept bitterly.&mdash;Imagining my &s;orrow was the effect of my misfortunes, he comforted me, by ob&s;erving that life was a voyage in which we mu&s;t expect to meet with all weathers: &s;ometimes it was calm, &s;ometimes rough; that a fair gale often &s;ucceeded a &s;torm: that the wind did not always &s;it one way, and that de&s;pair &s;ignified nothing: but re&s;olution and &s;kill were better than a &s;tout ve&s;&s;el: for why? becau&s;e they require no carpenter, and grow &s;tronger the more labour they undergo. I dried up my tears, which I a&s;&s;ured him were not &s;hed for my own di|&s;tre&s;s, but for his, and begged leave to accompany him into another room, where we could conver&s;e more at our ea&s;e.&mdash;There I recounted to him the ungenerous u&s;age I had met with from Potion; at which he &s;tarted up, &s;talk|ed acro&s;s the room three or four times, in a great hurry, and gra&s;ping his cudgel, cried, <Q>I would I were along-a&s;ide of him!&mdash;that's all.&mdash;I would I were along-&s;ide of him!</Q>&mdash;I then gave him a detail of all my adven|tures and &s;ufferings, which affected him more than I could have imagined; and concluded with telling him that Cap|tain Oakhum was &s;till alive, and that he might return to England when he would, to &s;olicit his affairs, without danger or mole&s;tation&punc;&mdash;He was wonderfully plea&s;ed at

I thought I perceived a great deal of &s;weetne&s;s and good na|ture in his countenance; therefore he had no &s;ooner alight|ed than I acco&s;ted him, and in a few words explained my &s;ituation: he li&s;tened with great politene&s;s, and, when I had made an end of my &s;tory, &s;aid, <Q>Well, mon&s;ieur, what would you have me do?</Q>&mdash;I was effectually aba&s;h|ed at this interrogation, which I believed no man of com|mon &s;en&s;e or genero&s;ity could make, and made no other reply than a low bow: he returned the compliment &s;till lower&punc; and tripped into an apartment, while the landlord let me know, that my &s;tanding there to interrupt company gave offence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd might do him infinite prejudice.

humanity to my mi&s;erable carca&s;e. A thou&s;and times I wi&s;hed my&s;elf a bear, that I might retreat to woods and de&s;erts, far from the inho&s;pitable haunts of man, where I could live by my own talons, independent of treacherous friends and &s;upercilious &s;corn.</P>
<P>As I lay in this manner, groaning over my haple&s;s fate, I heard the &s;ound of a violin, and, rai&s;ing my head, per|ceived a company of men and women dancing on the gra&s;s at &s;ome di&s;tance from me.

I had never before &s;een &s;uch a parcel of &s;care|crows together, neither could I reconcile their meagre gaunt looks, their &s;qualid and ragged attire, and every other external &s;ymptom of extreme woe, with this appear|ance of fe&s;tivity. I &s;aluted them, however, and was re|ceived with great politene&s;s: after which they formed a ring, and danced round me. This jollity had a wonderful effect upon my &s;pirits&punc; I was infected with their gaiety, and in &s;pite of my di&s;mal &s;ituation, forgot my cares, and joined in their extravagance. When we had recreated our&s;elves a good while at this diver&s;ion, the ladies &s;pread their man|tuas on the ground, upon which they emptied their knap|&s;acks of &s;ome onions, coar&s;e bread, and a few fla&s;ks of poor wine: being invited to a &s;hare of the banquet, I &s;at down with the re&s;t, and in the whole cour&s;e of my life never made a more comfortable meal.

Having therefore maturely weighed the circum&s;tances <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> I &s;ignified my con&s;ent, and was admitted into the regiment of Picardy, &s;aid to be the olde&s;t corps in Europe. The company, to which this command belonged, was quartered at a village not far off, whither we marched next day, and I was pre&s;ented to my captain, who &s;eemed very well plea&s;ed with my appearance, gave me a crown to drink, and ordered me to be accommodated with clothes, arms, and accoutrements: whereupon I &s;old my livery &s;uit, purcha&s;ed linen, and, as I was at great pains to learn the exerci&s;e, in a very &s;hort time became a complete &s;oldier.</P>
<P>It was not long before we received orders to join &s;everal more regiments, and march with all expedition into Ger|many, in order to reinforce Mare&s;chal Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> de Noailles, who was then encamped with his army on the &s;ide of the river Main, to watch the motions of the Engli&s;h, Au&s;trians and He&s;&s;ians, under the command of the Earl of Stair. We began our march accordingly, and I then became acquaint|ed with that part of a &s;oldier's life to which I had been hitherto a &s;tranger. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hunger and thir&s;t I &s;u&s;tained, and the fatigue I underwent in a march of &s;o many hundred miles, during which I was &s;o much chafed with the heat and motion of my limbs, that in a very &s;hort time the in&s;ide of my thighs and legs were deprived of &s;kin, and I proceeded in the utmo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orture. This misfortune I owed to the plumpne&s;s of my con&s;titu|tion, which I cur&s;ed, and envied the withered conditions of my comrades, who&s;e bodies could not &s;pare juice enough to &s;upply a common i&s;&s;ue, and were indeed proof again&s;t all manner of friction. The continual pain I felt made me fretful, and my peevi&s;hne&s;s was increa&s;ed by the mortifica|tion of my pride in &s;eeing tho&s;e mi&s;erable wretches, whom a hard gale of wind would have &s;cattered through the air like chaff, bear tho&s;e toils with alacrity under which I was ready to &s;ink.</P>
<P>One day while we enjoyed a halt, and the &s;oldiers with their wives had gone out to dance according to cu&s;tom, my comrade &s;taid at home with me on pretence of friend|&s;hip, and in&s;ulted me with his pity and con&s;olation! He told me, though I was young and tender at pre&s;ent, I would &s;oon be &s;ea&s;oned to the &s;ervice, and he did not doubt but I &s;hould have the honour to contribute in &s;ome

I ob&s;erved, that if his &s;ituation was the con&s;equence of compul&s;ion, as having been pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice, I would prai&s;e his patience and fortitude in bear|ing his lot&mdash;if he had taken up arms in defence of his in|jured country, he was to be applauded for his patrioti&s;m&mdash;or if he had fled to this way of life as a refuge from a greater evil, he was ju&s;tifiable in his own con&s;cience, (though I could have no notion of mi&s;ery more extreme than that he &s;uffered;) but to put his condition on the footing of conducing to the glory of his prince, was no more than profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf a de&s;perate &s;lave, who voluntarily underwent the utmo&s;t wretchedne&s;s and peril, and com|mitted the mo&s;t flagrant crimes, to &s;ooth the barbarous pride of a fellow-creature, his &s;uperior in nothing but the power he derived from the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch wretches as him. The &s;oldier was very much affronted at the liberty I took with his king, which he &s;aid nothing but my igno|rance could excu&s;e: he affirmed, that, the characters of princes were &s;acred, and ought not to be pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aned by the cen&s;ure of their &s;ubjects, who are bound by their allegiance to obey their commands, of what nature &s;oever, without &s;cruple or repining, and advi&s;ed me to correct the rebel|lious principles I had imbibed among the Engli&s;h, who, for their in&s;olence to their kings, were notorious all over the world even to a proverb:
<Q><L><HI>Le roy d' Angleterre,</HI></L>
<L><HI>E&s;t le roy de l' Enfer.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>In vindication of my countrymen I repeated all the ar|guments commonly u&s;ed to prove, that every man has a

natural right to liberty, that allegiance and protection are reciprocal, that, when the mutual ties are broken by the tyranny of the king, he is accountable to the people for his breach of contract, and &s;ubject to the penalty of the law, and that tho&s;e in&s;urrections of the Engli&s;h, which are branded with the name of rebellion by the &s;laves of arbi|trary power, were no other than glorious efforts to re&s;cue that independence, which was their birth-right, from the ravenous claws of u&s;urping ambition. The Frenchman, provoked at the little deference I paid to the kingly name, lo&s;t all patience, and reproached me in &s;uch a manner, that my temper for&s;ook me, and I clenched my fi&s;t, with an intention to give him an hearty box on the ear. Perceiving my de&s;ign, he &s;tarted back, and demanded a parley; upon which I checked my indignation, and he gave me to un|der&s;tand, that a Frenchman never forgave a blow; there|fore, if I was not weary of my life, I would do well to &s;pare him that mortification, and do him the honour of mea&s;uring his &s;word with mine like a gentleman. I took his advice, and followed him to a field hard by, where in|deed I was a&s;hamed at the pitiful figure of my antagoni&s;t, who was a poor, little, &s;hivering creature, decrepid with age, and blind of one eye. But I &s;oon found the folly of judging from appearance, being at the &s;econd pa&s;s wound|ed in the &s;word-hand, and immediately di&s;armed with &s;uch a jerk, that I thought the joint was di&s;located. I was no le&s;s confounded than enraged at this event, e&s;pecially as my adver&s;ary did not bear his &s;ucce&s;s with all the modera|tion that might have been expected; for he in&s;i&s;ted upon my a&s;king pardon for my affronting his king and him.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HE was di&s;concerted a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> this declaration, to which he made no reply, but repaired to the dancers, among whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he recounted his victory with many exaggerations and ga&s;conades, while I, taking up my &s;word, went to my quarters, and examined my wound, which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound was of no con&s;equence. The &s;ame day an Iri&s;h drummer, having heard my misfortune, vi&s;ited me, and, after having condoled me on the chance of war, gave me to under|&s;tand, that he was ma&s;ter of the &s;word, and would in a very &s;hort time in&s;truct me &s;o thoroughly in that noble &s;cience, that I &s;hould be able to cha&s;ti&s;e the old Ga&s;con for his in&s;olent boa&s;ting at my expence. This friendly office he proffered on pretence of the regard he had for his countrymen; but I afterwards learned, the true motive was no other than a jealou&s;y he entertained of a corre|&s;pondence between the Frenchman and his wife, which he did not think proper to re&s;ent in per&s;on. Be this as it will, I accepted his offer, and practi&s;ed his le&s;&s;ons with &s;uch application, that I &s;oon believed my&s;elf a match for my conqueror. In the mean time we continued our march, and arrived at the camp of Mare&s;chal Noailles the night before the battle of Dettingen. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;a|tigue we had undergone, our regiment was one of tho&s;e that were ordered next day to cro&s;s the river under the command of the Due de Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ont, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a narrow defile, through which the allies mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="47" REF="027715_0288_0FD5EDAB19BC68D0">
have pa&s;&s;ed at a great di&s;advantage, or remain where they were, and peri&s;h for want of provi&s;ion, if they would not conde&s;cend to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. How they &s;uffered them&s;elves to be pent up in this manner, it is not my pro|vince to relate; I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that, when we had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our ground, I heard an old officer, in conver&s;ation with another, profe&s;s a &s;urpri&s;e at the con|duct of Lord Stair, who had the reputation of a good general. But it &s;eems, at this time, that nobleman was over-ruled, and only acted in an inferior character; &s;o that no part of the blame could be imputed to him, who de|clared his di&s;approbation of the &s;tep, in con&s;equence of which the whole army was in the utmo&s;t danger: but Pro|vidence or de&s;tiny acted miracles in their behalf, by di&s;|po&s;ing the Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> de Gramont to quit his advantageous po&s;t, pa&s;s the defile, and attack the Engli&s;h, who were drawn up in order of battle on the plain, and who handled us &s;o roughly, that, after having lo&s;t a great number of men, we turned our backs without ceremony, and fled with &s;uch precipitation, that many hundreds peri&s;hed in the river through pure fear and confu&s;ion; for the enemy were &s;o generous, that they did not pur&s;ue us one inch of ground; and, if our con&s;ternation would have permitted, we might have retreated with great order and deliberation. But not|with&s;tanding the royal clemency of the king of Great-Bri|tain, who headed the allies in per&s;on, and, no doubt, put a &s;top to the carnage, our lo&s;s amounted to five thou&s;and men, among whom were many officers of di&s;tinction. Our mi&s;carriage opened a pa&s;&s;age for the foe to Hanau, whi|ther they immediately marched, leaving their &s;ick and wounded to the care of the French, who next day took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field of battle, buried the dead, and treat|ed the living with humanity. This was a great con&s;ola|tion to us, who thence took occa&s;ion to claim the victory, and the genius of the French nation never appeared more con&s;picuous than now, in the rodomontades they uttered on the &s;ubject of their genero&s;ity and courage; every man, by his own account, performed feats that would have ecli&s;ped all the heroes of antiquity. One compared him&s;elf to a lion retiring at lei&s;ure from his cowardly pur&s;uers, who keep at a wary di&s;tance, and galled him with their darts&mdash;Another likened him&s;elf to a bear that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">etreats with his face to the enemy, who dare not a&s;&s;ail him&mdash;and a third

a&s;&s;umed the character of a de&s;perate &s;tag that turns upon the hounds, and keeps them at bay. There was not a pri|vate &s;oldier engaged, who had not by the prowe&s;s of his &s;ingle arm, demoli&s;hed a whole platoon, or put a &s;quadron of hor&s;e to flight; and, among others, the meagre Ga&s;con extolled his exploits above tho&s;e of Hercules or Charle|magne. As I &s;till retained my re&s;entment for the di&s;grace I &s;uffered in my la&s;t rencontre with him, and, now that I thought my&s;elf qualified, I longed for an opportunity to retrieve my honour; I magnified the valour of the Engli&s;h with all the hyperboles I could imagine, and decried the pu&s;illanimity of the French in the &s;ame &s;tyle, comparing them to hares flying be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore grey-hounds, or mice pur&s;ued by cats; and pa&s;&s;ed an ironical compliment on the &s;peed he exerted in his flight, which, con&s;idering his age and infirmities, I &s;aid was &s;urprizing. He was &s;tung to the quick by this &s;arca&s;m, and, with an air of threatening di&s;|dain, bid me know my&s;elf better, and remember the cor|rection I had already received from him for my in&s;olence; for he might not always be in the humour of &s;paring a wretch who abu&s;ed his goodne&s;s. To this inuendo I made no reply but by a kick in the breech, which overturned him in an in&s;tant. He &s;tarted up with wonderful agility, and, drawing his &s;word, attacked me with great fury: &s;everal people interpo&s;ed; but, when he informed them of its being an affair of honour, they retired, and left us to decide the battle by our&s;elves. I &s;u&s;tained his on&s;et with little damage, having only received a &s;mall &s;cratch on my right &s;houlder, and, &s;eeing his breath and vigour almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, a&s;&s;aulted him in my turn, clo&s;ed with him, and wre&s;ted the &s;word out of his hand in the &s;truggle. Having thus acquired the victory, I de&s;ired him to beg his life; to which demand he made no an&s;wer, but &s;hrugged up his &s;houl|ders to his ears, expanded his hands, elevated the &s;kin of his forehead and eye-brows, and depre&s;&s;ed the corners of his mouth in &s;uch a manner, that I could &s;carce re&s;rain from laughing aloud at his grote&s;que appearance. That I might, however, mortify his vanity, which had triumphed without bounds over my misfortune, I thru&s;t his &s;word up to the hilt in &s;omething (it was not a tan&s;y) that lay &s;moking on the plain, and joined the re&s;t of the &s;oldiers with an air of tranquillity and indifference.</P>

There was nothing more of moment attempted by ei|ther of the armies during the remaining part of the cam|paign, which being ended, the Engli&s;h marched back to the Netherlands; part of our army was detached to French Flanders, and our regiment ordered into winter-quarters in Champaigne. It was the fate of the grenadier company, to which I now belonged, to lie at Rheims, where I found my&s;elf in the utmo&s;t want of every-thing. My pay, which amounted to five &s;ols a-day, far from &s;upplying me with nece&s;&s;aries, was &s;carce &s;ufficient to procure a wretched &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to keep &s;oul and body together; &s;o that I was, by hunger and hard duty, brought down to the meagre condition of my fellow-&s;oldiers, and my linen reduced from three tolerable &s;hirts to two pair of &s;leeves and necks, the bodies having been long ago converted into &s;patterda&s;hes; and after all I was better provided than any private man in the regiment&punc; In this urgency of my affairs, I wrote to my uncle in England, though my hopes from that quar|ter were not at all &s;anguine for the rea&s;ons I have already explained, and in the mean time had recour&s;e to my old remedy patience, con&s;oling my&s;elf with the flattering &s;ug|ge&s;tions of a lively imagination, that never abandoned me in my di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>One day, while I &s;tood centinel at the gate of a gene|ral-officer, a certain nobleman came to the door, followed by a gentleman in mourning, to whom at parting I heard him &s;ay, "You may depend upon my good offices." This a&s;&s;urance was an&s;wered by a low bow of the per&s;on in black, who, turning to go away, di&s;covered to me the in|dividual countenance of my old friend and adherent Strap. I was &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ight that I lo&s;t the power of utterance, and, before I could recollect my|&s;elf, he was gone without taking any notice of me. In|deed, had he &s;taid, I &s;carcely &s;hould have ventured to acco&s;t him, becau&s;e, though I was perfectly well acquainted with the features of his face, I could not be po&s;itively certain as to the re&s;t of his per&s;on, which was very much altered for the better &s;ince he left me at London; neither could I conjecture by what means he was enabled to appear in the &s;phere of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gentleman, to which, while I knew him, he had not eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the ambition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o a&s;pire.

therefore took the fir&s;t opportunity of a&s;king the porter if he knew the gentleman to whom the marquis &s;poke? The Swi&s;s told me his name was Mon&s;ieur d'E&s;trapes, that he had been valet de chambre to an Engli&s;h gentle|man lately decea&s;ed, and that he was very much regarded by the marquis for his fidelity to his ma&s;ter, between whom and that nobleman a very intimate friend&s;hip had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. Nothing could be more agreeable to me than this piece of intelligence, which bani&s;hed all doubt of its being my friend, who had found means to Frenchi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y his name as well as his behaviour &s;ince we parted. As &s;oon, therefore, as I was relieved, I went to his lodging accord|ing to a direction given me by the Swi&s;s, and had the good fortune to find him at home. That I might &s;urpri&s;e him the more, I concealed my name and bu&s;ine&s;s, and only de&s;ired the &s;ervant of the hou&s;e to tell Mon&s;ieur d'E&s;trapes, that I begged the honour of half an hour's conver&s;ation with him. He was confounded and di&s;mayed at this me&s;&s;age, when he under&s;tood it was &s;ent by a &s;ol|dier, though he was con&s;cious to him&s;elf of no crime: all that he had heard of the Ba&s;tile appeared to his imagina|tion with aggravated horror, and it was not before I had waited a con&s;iderable time, that he had re&s;olution enough to bid the &s;ervant &s;hew me up &s;tairs. When I entered his chamber, he returned my bow with great civility, and en|deavoured by a forced complai&s;ance to di&s;gui&s;e his fear, which appeared in the palene&s;s of his face, the wildne&s;s of his looks, and the &s;haking of his limbs. I was diverted at his con&s;ternation, which redoubled when I told him in French, I had bu&s;ine&s;s for his private ear, and demanded a particular audience. The valet being withdrawn, I a&s;ked in the &s;ame language, if his name was d'E&s;trapes?

I was ravi&s;hed at this piece of good news, and, having accommodated my&s;elf in a moment, hugged my benefactor for his generous offer, &s;aying I was overjoyed to find him undebanched by pro&s;perity, which &s;eldom fails of corrupting the heart. He be&s;poke for dinner &s;ome &s;oup and bouille, a couple of pullets roa&s;ted, and a di&s;h of a&s;pa|ragus, and in the interim entertained me with bi&s;cuit and Burgundy; after which repa&s;t, he entreated me to gratify his longing de&s;ire of knowing every circum&s;tance of my for|tune &s;ince his departure from London. This I complied with, beginning at the adventure of Gawky, and relating every particular event in which I had been concerned from that day to the pre&s;ent hour. During the recital, my friend was &s;trongly affected, according to the various &s;ituations de&s;cribed; he &s;tarted with &s;urpri&s;e, glowed with indigna|tion, gaped with curio&s;ity, &s;miled with plea&s;ure, trembled with fear, and wept with &s;orrow, as the vici&s;&s;itudes of my life in&s;pired the&s;e different pa&s;&s;ions; and, when my &s;tory was ended, &s;ignified his amazement on the whole by lift|ing up his eyes and hands, and prote&s;ting, that, though I was a young man, I had &s;uffered more than all the ble&s;&s;ed martyrs.</P>
<P>After dinner I de&s;ired, in my turn, to know the parti|culars of his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">grination, and he &s;atisfied me in a few words, by giving me to under&s;tand, that he had lived a year at Paris with his ma&s;ter, who, in that time having acquired the language, and well as the fa&s;hionable exerci&s;es, to perfection, made the tour of France and Holland, during which excur&s;ion he was &s;o unfortunate as to meet with three of his own countrymen on their travels, in who&s;e company he committed &s;uch exce&s;&s;es, that his con|&s;titution failed, and he fell into a con&s;umption; that, by the advice of phy&s;icians, he went to Montpelier for the benefit of good air, and recovered &s;o well in &s;ix weeks, that he returned to Rheims &s;eemingly in good health, where he had not continued above a month, when he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eized with a loo&s;ene&s;s that carried him off in ten days, to the un&s;peakable &s;orrow of all who knew him, and e&s;pe|cially

<P>Early in the morning, I went to the lodgings of my friend, whom I found exulting over his happy invention; for I no &s;ooner entered his apartment, than he addre&s;&s;ed me in the&s;e words, with a &s;mile of &s;elf applau&s;e: <Q>Well, Mr. Random, a lucky thought may come into a fool's head &s;ometimes&mdash;I have hit it&mdash;I'll hold you a button my plan is better than yours, for all your learning.&mdash;But you &s;hall have the preference in this as in all other things; therefore proceed, and let us know the effects of your meditation&mdash;and then I will impart my own &s;im|ple excogitations.</Q>&mdash;I told him, that not one thought occurred to me which de&s;erved the lea&s;t notice, and &s;igni|fied my impatience to be acquainted with the fruits of his reflection.&mdash;"As we have not," &s;aid he, <Q>money &s;uffici|ent to maintain us during a tedious expectation, it is my opinion, that a bold pu&s;h mu&s;t be made, and I &s;ee none &s;o likely to &s;ucceed as your appearing in the cha|racter of a gentleman, which is your due, and making your addre&s;&s;es to &s;ome lady of fortune who can render you independent at once&mdash;Nay, don't &s;tare&mdash;I affirm that this &s;cheme is both prudent and honourable; for I would not have you throw your&s;elf away upon an old toothle&s;s, wheezing dame, who&s;e breath would &s;tink you into a con&s;umption in le&s;s than three months; neither would I advi&s;e you to a&s;&s;ume the character of a wealthy &s;quire, as your common fortune-hunters do, by which means many a poor lady is cheated into ma|trimony, and in&s;tead of enjoying the pomp and gran|deur that was promi&s;ed, &s;ees her dowry &s;eized by her hu&s;band's rapacious creditors, and her&s;elf reduced to mi&s;ery and de&s;pair.&mdash;No, I know you have a &s;oul that di&s;dains &s;uch impo&s;ition; and are ma&s;ter of qualifica|tions both of mind and body, which alone entitle you to a match that will &s;et you above the world.&mdash;I have clothes in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that a duke need not be a&s;ham|ed to wear.&mdash;I believe they will fit you as they are, if not, there are plenty of taylors in France.&mdash;Let us

<P>AS &s;oon as we alighted at the inn, I di&s;patched Strap to enquire for my uncle, at the Union Flag in Wapping; and he returned in a little time with an ac|count of Mr. Bowling's having gone to &s;ea, mate of a merchant &s;hip, after a long and un&s;ucce&s;sful application and attendance at the admiralty; where it &s;eems the in|tere&s;t he depended upon, was not &s;ufficient to rein&s;tate him, or recover the pay that was due to him when he quitted the Thunder.</P>
<P>Next day I hired very hand&s;ome lodgings not far from Charing-cro&s;s; and in the evening dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in a

plain &s;uit of the true Paris cut, and appeared in a front box at the play, where I &s;aw a good deal of company, and was vain enough to believe that I was ob&s;erved with an uncommon degree of attention and applau&s;e. This &s;illy conceit intoxicated me &s;o much, that I was guilty of a thou&s;and ridiculous coquetries, and I dare &s;ay, how favourable &s;oever the thoughts of the company might be at my fir&s;t appearance, they were &s;oon changed by my ab&s;urd behaviour into pity or contempt.&mdash;I ro&s;e up and &s;at down, covered and uncovered my head twenty times between the acts; pulled out my watch, clapped it to my ear, wound it up, &s;et it, gave it the hearing again; di&s;played my &s;nuff-box, affected to take &s;nuff, that I might have an opportunity of &s;hewing my brilliant, and wiped my no&s;e with a perfumed handkerchief;&mdash;then dangled my cane, and adju&s;ted my &s;word-k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot, and acted many more fooleries of the &s;ame kind, in hopes of attain|ing the character of a pretty fellow, in the acquiring of which, I found two con&s;iderable ob&s;tructions in my di&s;|po&s;ition; namely, a natural re&s;erve, and jealous &s;en&s;ibili|ty.&mdash;Fain would I have entered into conver&s;ation with the people around me; but was re&s;trained by the fear of being cen&s;ured for my a&s;&s;urance, as well as by reflecting that I was more entitled to a compliment of this kind from them, than they to &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ion from a &s;tranger like me.&mdash;How often did I redden at the frequent whi&s;pers and loud laughter of my fellow beaux, which I imagined were excited by me! and how often did I envy the happy indifference of tho&s;e choice &s;pirits who beheld the di&s;tre&s;s of the &s;cene, without di&s;covering the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of approbation or concern! My attention was engaged in &s;pite of my&s;elf, and I could not help weeping with the heroine of the &s;tage; though I practi&s;ed a great many &s;hifts to conceal this piece of impolite weakne&s;s.&mdash;When the play was ended, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at waiting for an opportunity of handing &s;ome lady to her coach; but every one was at|tended by &s;uch a number of officious gallants, that for a long time I was baulked in my expectation.&mdash;At length&punc; however, I perceived a very hand&s;ome creature, genteely dre&s;&s;ed, &s;itting by her&s;elf in a box, at &s;ome di&s;tance from me; upon which I went up to her, and offered my &s;ervice.&mdash;She &s;eemed to be in &s;ome confu&s;ion, thanked me for

my complai&s;ance, and with a tender look declined giving me the trouble; looking at her watch, and te&s;tifying her &s;urpri&s;e at the negligence of her footman, whom &s;he had ordered to have a chair ready for her at that hour.&mdash;I re|peated my intreaty with all the eloquence and compliment I was ma&s;ter of; and in the event, &s;he was prevailed upon to accept of a propo&s;al I made to &s;end my &s;ervant for a chair or coach. Accordingly&punc; Strap was detached for that purpo&s;e, and returned without &s;ucce&s;s, there being none to be found; by this time the play-hou&s;e was quite empty, and we were obliged to retire: as I led her through the pa&s;&s;age, I ob&s;erved five or &s;ix young fellows of fa&s;hion, &s;tanding in a corner, one of whom, as I thought, tipt my charmer the wink, and when we were pa&s;t, I heard them &s;et up a loud laugh.&mdash;This arou&s;ed my at|tention, and I was re&s;olved to be fully &s;atisfied of this la|dy's character before I &s;hould have any nearer connection with her.&mdash;As no convenience appeared, I propo&s;ed, that I &s;hould conduct her to a tavern, where we might &s;tay a few minutes, till my &s;ervant could fetch a coach from the Strand.&mdash;She &s;eemed particularly &s;hy of tru&s;ting her|&s;elf in a tavern with a &s;tranger; but at la&s;t yielded to my pathetic r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mon&s;trances, rather than endanger her health, by remaining in a cold damp thorough-fare.&mdash;Having thus far &s;ucceeded, I begged to know what wine &s;he would be plea&s;ed to drink a gla&s;s of; but &s;he profe&s;&s;ed the great|e&s;t aver&s;ion to all &s;orts of &s;trong liquors; and it was with much difficulty that I could per&s;uade her to eat a jelly.&mdash;In the mean time, I endeavoured to alleviate the unea&s;i|ne&s;s &s;he di&s;covered, by &s;aying all the agreeable things I could think of; at which &s;he would often &s;igh, and regard me with a langui&s;hing look, that &s;eemed, however, too near a kin to the lewd leer of a courtezan.&mdash;This di&s;covery ad|ded to my former &s;u&s;picion, while it put me upon my guard again&s;t her arts, dive&s;ted me of re&s;erve, and ena|bled me to entertain her with gaiety and freedom. In the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation I pre&s;&s;ed her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o allow me the honour of waiting upon her next day at her lodgings, which &s;he, with many apologies, refu&s;ed, le&s;t it &s;hould give umbrage to Sir John, who was of a di&s;po&s;ition apt to be fretted with trifles. This information, by which I was to under&s;tand that her hu&s;band was a knight, did not

check my addre&s;&s;es, which became more and more impor|tunate, and I was even hardy enough to ravi&s;h a ki&s;s.&mdash;But, O heavens! in&s;tead of banqueting on the ambro&s;ial flavour that her delicacy and complexion promi&s;ed, I was almo&s;t &s;uffocated with the &s;teams of Geneva! An exhala|tion of this kind from a mouth which had ju&s;t before de|clared an utter abhorrence of all &s;pirituous liquors, not on|ly changed my doubts into certainty, but my raptures into loathing; and it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for me to have pre&s;erved common complai&s;ance five minutes longer, when my &s;ervant returned with a coach.&mdash;I took the advantage of this occa&s;ion, and pre&s;ented my hand to the lady, who put in practice again&s;t me the whole artillery of her charms, ogling, langui&s;hing, &s;ighing, and &s;queezing, with &s;o lit|tle re&s;erve, that Strap perceived her tenderne&s;s, and rub|bed his hands with joy as he followed us to the door;&mdash;but I was proof again&s;t all her endearments, and handed her into the coach with an intention to take my leave im|mediately. She gue&s;&s;ed my de&s;ign, and invited me to her hou&s;e, whi&s;pering, that now Sir John was gone to bed, &s;he could have the plea&s;ure of my conver&s;ation for half an hour without interruption.&mdash;I told her there was no mortification I would not undergo, rather than endan|ger the repo&s;e of her lady&s;hip; and bidding the coach|man drive on, wi&s;hed her a good night. She lo&s;t all tem|per at my indifference, and &s;topping the coach at the di|&s;tance of about twenty yards from me, popped out her head, and bawled with the lungs of a fi&s;h-woman, <Q>D&mdash;n you, you dog, won't you pay the coach hire?</Q> I made no an&s;wer: upon which &s;he held forth again&s;t me with an eloquence peculiar to her&s;elf; calling me pitiful fellow, &s;coundrel, and an hundred &s;uch appellations; and con|cluding with an oath, that for all my appearance, &s;he be|lieved I had got no money in my pocket.</P>
<P>Having thus vented her indignation, &s;he ordered the coachman to proceed, and I returned to the tavern, where I be&s;poke &s;omething for &s;upper, very well plea&s;ed at the i&s;&s;ue of this adventure.&mdash;I di&s;pen&s;ed with the attendance of the waiter at table, on pretence that my own &s;ervant was pre&s;ent, and when we were alone, &s;aid to Strap; <Q>Well, Mon&s;ieur d'E&s;trapes, what d'ye think of this la|dy?</Q> My friend, who had not opened his mouth &s;ince

her departure, could make no other an&s;wer than the mono|&s;yllable, "Think!" which he pronounced with a note of fear and a&s;toni&s;hment.&mdash;Surpri&s;ed at this empha&s;is, I &s;urveyed my valet, and, perceiving a wildne&s;s in his looks, a&s;ked if he had &s;een his grandfather's gho&s;t?&mdash;"Gho&s;t!" &s;aid he, <Q>I am &s;ure I have &s;een a devil incarnate!

God help us! <HI>Fronti nulla fides&mdash;nimium ne credi colori</HI>&mdash;but we ought to down on our knees and ble&s;s God for delivering us from the jaws of that painted &s;epulchre.</Q>&mdash;I was pretty much of Strap's opinion, and though I did not believe my|&s;elf in any danger from the allurements of that &s;i&s;terhood, I determined to act with great circum&s;pection for the future, and &s;hun all commerce of that kind, as equally prejudicial to my pur&s;e and con&s;titution.</P>
<P>My next care was to introduce my&s;elf into a &s;et of good acquaintance; for which purpo&s;e I frequented a certain coffee-hou&s;e, noted for the re&s;ort of good company, Eng|li&s;h as well as foreigners, where my appearance procured all the civilities and advances I could de&s;ire. There be|ing an ordinary in the &s;ame hou&s;e, I went up &s;tairs to dinner with the other gue&s;ts, and found my&s;elf at table with thirteen people, the greate&s;t part of whom were better dre&s;&s;ed than my&s;elf.&mdash;The conver&s;ation, which was mo&s;tly carried on in French, turned chiefly on politics; and I &s;oon found the whole company was in the French intere&s;t, my&s;elf excepted, and a te&s;ty old gentleman, who contradicted every thing that was advanced in favour of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, with a &s;urline&s;s truly Engli&s;h.&mdash;But this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> patriot, who had never been out of his own country, and drew all his maxims and notions from prejudice and hear&s;ay, was very unequal to his antago|ni&s;ts, who were &s;uperior to him in learning and experi|ence, and often took the liberty of travellers, in a&s;&s;erting things which were not &s;trictly true, becau&s;e they thought them&s;elves in no danger of being detected by him.&mdash;The claim of the queen of Spain to the Au&s;trian dominions in Italy, was fully explained and vindicated, by a per&s;on who &s;at oppo&s;ite to me, and by the &s;olemnity of his man|ner, and the richne&s;s of his apparel, &s;eemed to be a fo|reign

amba&s;&s;ador.&mdash;This di&s;&s;ertation introduced another on the Pragmatic Sanction, handled with great warmth, by a young gentleman at my right hand, dre&s;&s;ed in a green frock trimmed with gold, who ju&s;tified the French king for his breach of that contract; and affirmed, that he could not have ob&s;erved it, without injuring his own glory.&mdash;Although I was not at all convinced by this gen|tleman's arguments, I could not help admiring his viva|city, which I imagined mu&s;t be the effect of his illu&s;tri|ous birth, and noble education, and accordingly rated him in my conjecture as a young prince on his travels.&mdash;The di&s;cour&s;e was afterwards &s;hifted by an old gentleman of a very martial appearance, to the la&s;t campaign, when the battle of Dettingen was fought over again, with &s;o many circum&s;tances to the honor of the French, and di&s;|advantage of the allies, that I began to entertain &s;ome doubts of my having been there in per&s;on; and took the liberty to mention &s;ome objections to what he advanced.</P>
<P>This freedom introduced a di&s;pute which la&s;ted a good while, to the mortification of all pre&s;ent; and was at la&s;t re|ferred to the determination of a grave per&s;on, whom they &s;tiled doctor, and who, under a &s;hew of great moderation, de|cided it again&s;t me, with &s;o little regard to truth, that I taxed him with partiality in pretty &s;evere terms, to the no &s;mall entertainment of the true Engli&s;h politician, who rejoiced at my defence of a cau&s;e he had &s;o often e&s;pou&s;|ed without &s;ucce&s;s: my opponent, plea&s;ed with the vic|tory he had gained, affected a great deal of candour, and told me he &s;hould not have been &s;o po&s;itive, if he had not been at great pains to inform him&s;elf of each particular.&mdash;"Indeed," &s;aid he, <Q>I am convinced, that the pre|vious &s;teps con&s;idered, things could not happen other|wi&s;e; for we generals who have &s;een &s;ervice, though we may not be on the &s;pot our&s;elves, know by the lea&s;t &s;ketch of the di&s;po&s;ition, what mu&s;t be the event.</Q>&mdash;He then cen&s;ured with great freedom, every circum&s;tance of the conduct of tho&s;e who commanded the allies; from thence made a tran&s;ition to the mini&s;try, which he ho|noured with many invectives, for employing people who had neither experience nor capacity, to the prejudice of old officers who had been di&s;tingui&s;hed for both; dropt many hints of his own importance; and concluded with

ob&s;erving, that the French and Spaniards know better how to value generals of merit; the good effects of which are &s;een in the conque&s;ts they gain, and the admirable di&s;cipline of their troops, which are at the &s;ame time bet|ter clothed and paid than any &s;oldiers in the univer&s;e. The&s;e remarks furni&s;hed the green knight with an oppor|tunity of launching out into the prai&s;e of the French govern|ment in general, civil as well as military; on which occa|&s;ion he made many odious compari&s;ons to the di&s;advan|tage of the Engli&s;h. Every body almo&s;t a&s;&s;ented to the ob&s;ervations he made, and the doctor gave his &s;anction, by &s;aying, the people of France were undoubtedly the happie&s;t &s;ubjects in the world.&mdash;I was &s;o much a&s;to|ni&s;hed and confounded at their infatuation and effrontery, that I had not power to utter one word in oppo&s;ition to their a&s;&s;ertions; but my moro&s;e a&s;&s;ociate could not put up with the indignity that was offered to old England, and therefore with a &s;atirical grin addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the general in the&s;e words: <Q>Sir, Sir, I have often heard it &s;aid, <HI>She's a villainous bird that befouls her own ne&s;t.</HI>&mdash;As for what tho&s;e people, who are foreigners, &s;ay, I don't mind it, they know no better; but you who were bred and born, and have got your bread under the Engli&s;h government, &s;hould have more regard to gratitude as well as truth, in cen&s;uring your native country.&mdash;If the mini&s;try have thought fit to lay you a&s;ide, I &s;uppo&s;e they have their own rea&s;ons for &s;o do|ing; and you ought to remember that you &s;till live on the bounty of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> nation.&mdash;As for the&s;e gentlemen, (meaning the prince and amba&s;&s;ador,) who make &s;o free with our con&s;titution, laws and genius of our peo|ple, I think they might &s;hew a little more re&s;pect for their benefactors, who, I mu&s;t own, are to blame in harbouring, protecting and encouraging &s;uch ungrateful vagrants as they are.</Q>&mdash;At the&s;e words the chevalier in green &s;tarted up in a great pa&s;&s;ion, and laying his hand on the hilt of his hanger, exclaimed, "Ha! <HI>foutre!"</HI>&mdash;The Engli&s;hman, on the other hand, gra&s;ping his cane, cried, <Q>Don't <HI>foutre</HI> me, &s;irrah, or by G&mdash;d I'll knock you down.</Q>&mdash;The company interpo&s;ed, the Frenchman &s;at down again, and his antagoni&s;t proceeded.&mdash;<Q>Lookee, Mon&s;ieur, you know very well that had you dared to

When a &s;tory is told of any great general, he immediately matches it with one of him&s;elf, though he is often unhappy in his invention, and commits &s;uch gro&s;s blunders in the detail, that every body is in pain for him.&mdash;Cae&s;ar, Pompey, and Alexander the Great, are continually in his mouth; and as he reads a good deal without any judgment to dige&s;t it, his ideas are confu&s;ed, and his harangues as unintelligible as infi|nite; for once he begins, there is no chance of his leaving off &s;peaking, while one per&s;on remains to yield attention; therefore the only expedient I know for putting a &s;top to his loquacity, is to lay hold of &s;ome incongruity he has uttered, and demand an explana|tion; or a&s;k the meaning of &s;ome difficult term that he knows by name only; this will effectually put him to &s;ilence, if not to flight, as it happened when I en|quired about an epaulement. Had he been acquainted with the &s;ignification of that word, his triumph would have been intolerable, and we mu&s;t have quitted the field fir&s;t, or been worried with impertinence.</Q> Having thus gratified my curio&s;ity, the old gentleman began to di&s;cover his own in que&s;tions relating to my&s;elf, to which I thought proper to return ambiguous an&s;wers. <Q>I pre|&s;ume,

<P>I ACCEPTED his offer with plea&s;ure, and we went thither in a hackney-coach, where I &s;aw a great number of gay figures fluttering about, mo&s;t of whom &s;poke to the doctor with great familiarity. Among the re&s;t &s;tood a group of them around the fire, whom I immediately knew to be the very per&s;ons who had the night before, by their laughing, alarmed my &s;u&s;picions of the lady who had put her&s;elf under my protection. They no &s;ooner perceived me enter with Dr. Wagtail, (for that was my companion's name,) than they tittered and whi&s;pered one to another; and I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that they were the gentlemen to who&s;e acquaintance he de&s;igned to recom|mend me; for, when he ob&s;erved them together, he told me who they were, and de&s;ired to know by what name he &s;hould introduce me. I &s;atisfied him in that particular, and he advanced with great gravity, &s;aying, <Q>Gentlemen, your mo&s;t obedient. Give me leave to introduce my friend Mr. Random to your &s;ociety.</Q> Then turning

to me, <Q>Mr. Random, this is Mr. Bragwell&mdash;Mr. Ban|ter, Sir&mdash;Mr. Chatter&mdash;my friend, Mr. Slyboot, and Mr. Ranter, Sir.</Q> I &s;aluted each of them in order, and, when I came to take Mr. Slyboot by the hand, I perceived him thru&s;t his tongue in his che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k, to the no &s;mall entertainment of the company; but I did not think proper to take any notice of it on this occa&s;ion. Mr. Ranter too (who I afterwards learned was a player) di&s;played his talents by mimicking my air, features, and voice, while he returned my compliment; this feat I &s;hould not have been &s;o &s;en&s;ible of, had I not &s;een him behave in the &s;ame manner to my friend Wagtail, when he made up to them at fir&s;t. But for once I let him enjoy the fruits of his dexterity without que&s;tion or controul, re&s;olved, however, to cha&s;ti&s;e his in&s;olence at a more convenient opportunity. Mr. Slyboot, gue&s;&s;ing I was a &s;tranger, a&s;ked if I had lately been in France? and, when I an&s;wered in the affirma|tive, inquired if I had &s;een the Luxemburgh galley? I told him I had con&s;idered it more than once with great attention: upon this a conver&s;ation en&s;ued, in which I di&s;covered him to be a painter. While we were di&s;cour&s;ing upon the particulars of this famous performance. I over|heard Banter a&s;k Dr. Wagtail, where he had picked up this Mr. Random? To which que&s;tion the phy&s;ician an|&s;wered, <Q>Upon my word, a mighty pretty &s;ort of a gen|tleman&mdash;a man of fortune, Sir&mdash;he has made the grand tour, and &s;een the be&s;t company in Europe, Sir.</Q>&mdash;"What, he told you &s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e?" &s;aid the other; <Q>I take him to be neither more nor le&s;s than a French valet de chambre.</Q>&mdash;"O! barbarous, barbarous!" cried the doctor; <Q>this is actually, upon my word, al|together unaccountable. I know all his family perfectly well, Sir&mdash;he's of the Randoms in the north&mdash;a very ancient hou&s;e, Sir, and a di&s;tant relation of mine.</Q>&mdash;I was extremely nettled at the conjecture of Mr. Banter, and began to entertain a very indifferent opinion of my company in general: but, as I might po&s;&s;ibly by their means acquire a more exten&s;ive and agreeable acquaint|ance, I determined to bear the&s;e little mortifications as long as I could without injuring the dignity of my cha|racter. After having talked for &s;ome time on the wea|ther, plays, politics, and other coffee-hou&s;e &s;ubjects, it

was propo&s;ed we &s;hould &s;pend the evening at a noted tavern in the neighbourhood, whither we repaired in a body. Having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a room, called for French wine, and be&s;poke &s;upper, the gla&s;s went about pretty freely, and the characters of my a&s;&s;ociates opened upon me more and more. It &s;oon appeared that the doctor was entertained as a butt for the painter and player to exerci&s;e their wit upon for the diver&s;ion of the company. Mr. Ranter began the game by a&s;king him what was good for hoar&s;ene&s;s, lowne&s;s of &s;pirits, and indige&s;tion, for he was troubled with all the&s;e complaints to a very great degree. Wagtail immediately undertook to explain the nature of his ca&s;e, and, in a very prolix manner, harangued upon progno&s;tics, diagno&s;tics, &s;ymptomatics, therapeutics, in|anition, and repletion; then calculated the force of the &s;tomach and lungs in their re&s;pective operations, a&s;cribed the player's malady to a di&s;order in the&s;e organs proceed|ing from hard drinking and vociferation, and pre&s;cribed a cour&s;e of &s;tomachics, with ab&s;tinence from venery, wine, loud &s;peaking, laughing, &s;inging, coughing, &s;neezing, or hallooing. "Pah, pah," cried Ranter, interrupting him, <Q>the remedy is wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;I wi&s;h I knew where to find &s;ome tinder-water.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Tinder|water!</Q> &s;aid the doctor; <Q>upon my word I don't apprehend you, Mr. Ranter.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Water extracted from tinder,</Q> replied the other; <Q>an univer&s;al &s;pecific for all di&s;tempers incident to man. It was invented by a learned German monk, who for a valuable con&s;ideration imparted the &s;ecret to Paracel&s;us.</Q>&mdash;"Pardon m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">," cried the painter, <Q>it was fir&s;t u&s;ed by Solomon, as ap|pears by a Greek manu&s;cript in his own hand-writing, lately found at the foot of Mount Lebanon by a pea|&s;ant who was digging for potatoes.</Q>&mdash;"Well," &s;aid Wagtail, <Q>in all my va&s;t reading I never met with &s;uch a preparation! neither did I know till this minute, that Solomon under&s;tood Greek, or that potatoes grew in Pale&s;tine.</Q> Here Banter interpo&s;ed, &s;aying, he was &s;urpri&s;ed Doctor Wagtail &s;hould make the lea&s;t doubt of Solomon's under&s;tanding Greek, when he is repre&s;ented to us as the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t educated prince in the world; and as for potatoes, they were tran&s;planted thither from Ire|land, in the time of the Cru&s;ades, by &s;ome knights of that

country. "I profe&s;s," &s;aid the doctor, <Q>there is nothing more likely&mdash;I would actually give a va&s;t &s;um for a &s;ight of that manu&s;cript, which mu&s;t be ine&s;timable&mdash;and, if I under&s;tood the proce&s;s, would &s;et about it immediate|ly.</Q> The player a&s;&s;ured him, that the proce&s;s was very &s;imple&mdash;that he mu&s;t cram a hundred weight of dry tinder into a gla&s;s retort, and, di&s;tilling it by the force of animal heat, it would yield half a &s;cruple of in&s;ipid water, one drop of which is a full do&s;e. "Upon my integrity!" ex|claimed the credulous doctor, <Q>this is amazing and ex|traordinary, that a <HI>caput mortuum</HI> &s;hall yield any water at all!&mdash;I mu&s;t own I have always been an enemy to &s;pecifics, which I thought incon&s;i&s;tent with the na|ture of the animal oeconomy; but certainly the autho|rity of Solomon is not to be que&s;tioned&mdash;I wonder where I &s;hall find a gla&s;s retort large enough to contain &s;uch a va&s;t quantity of tinder, the con&s;umption of which mu&s;t undoubtedly rai&s;e the price of paper&mdash;or where &s;hall I find animal heat &s;ufficient even to warm &s;uch a ma&s;s?</Q>&mdash;Slyboot informed him, that he might have a retort blown for him as big as a church, and that the ea&s;ie&s;t method of rai&s;ing the vapour by animal heat would be to place it in the middle of an infirmary for fe|veri&s;h patients, who might lie upon matra&s;&s;es around, and in contact with it. He had no &s;ooner pronounced the&s;e words than Wagtail exclaimed in a rapture, <Q>An admi|rable expedient, as I hope to be &s;aved! I will po&s;itively put it in practice.</Q> This &s;implicity of the phy&s;ician furni&s;hed excellent diver&s;ion for the company, who in their turns &s;neered at him in ironical compliments, which his vanity &s;wallowed as the genuine &s;entiments of their hearts. Mr. Chatter, impatient of &s;o long a &s;ilence, now broke out, and entertained us with a catalogue of all the people who danced at the la&s;t Hamp&s;tead a&s;&s;embly, with a mo&s;t circum&s;tantial account of the dre&s;s and ornaments of each, from the lappets of the ladies to the &s;hoe-buckles of the men, concluding with telling Bragwell, that his mi&s;tre&s;s Melinda was there, and &s;eemed to mi&s;s him, and &s;oliciting his company at the next occa&s;ion of this kind. <Q>No, no, damme,</Q> &s;aid Bragwell, <Q>I have &s;omething el&s;e to mind than dangling after a parcel of giddy-headed girls&mdash;be&s;ides you know my temper is &s;o unruly, that

I am apt to involve my&s;elf in &s;crapes when a woman is concerned&mdash;The la&s;t time I was there, I had an affair with Tom Trippet.</Q>&mdash;"O! I remember that," cried Banter; <Q>you lugged out before the ladies; and I com|mend you for &s;o doing, becau&s;e you had an opportunity of &s;hewing your manhood without running any ri&s;k.</Q>"Ri&s;k!" &s;aid the other with a fierce countenance; <Q>d&mdash;n my blood! I fear no ri&s;ks. I an't afraid of lug|ging out again&s;t any man that wears a head, damme! 'tis well known I have drawn blood more than once, and lo&s;t &s;ome too; but what does that &s;ignify?</Q> The player begged this champion to employ him as his &s;econd the next time he intended to kill; for he wanted to &s;ee a man die o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;tab, that he might know how to act &s;uch a part the more naturally on the &s;tage.&mdash;"Die!" replied the hero&punc; <Q>No, by G&mdash;d!

I &s;hould look upon my fencing-ma&s;ter to be an ignorant &s;on of a b&mdash;ch, if he had not taught me to prick any part of my antagoni&s;t's body that I plea&s;e to di&s;able.</Q>&mdash;"O ho!" cried Slyboot, <Q>if that be the ca&s;e, I have a favour to a&s;k: you mu&s;t know I am employed to paint a Je&s;us on the cro&s;s, and my purpo&s;e is to repre&s;ent him at that point of time when the &s;pear is thru&s;t into his &s;ide&mdash;Now I &s;hould be glad you would, in my pre|&s;ence pink &s;ome impertinent fellow into convul&s;ions, without endangering his life, that I may have an op|portunity of taking a good clever agony from nature; the doctor will direct you where to enter, and how far to go; but pray let it be as near the left &s;ide as po&s;&s;i|ble.</Q> Wagtail who took this propo&s;al &s;eriou&s;ly, ob|&s;erved, that it would be a very difficult matter to pene|trate into the left &s;ide of the thorax without hurting the heart, and of con&s;equence killing the patient; but he be|lieved it was po&s;&s;ible for a man of a very nice hand, and exact knowledge of anatomy, to wound the diaphragma &s;omewhere about the &s;kirts, which might induce a &s;ingul|tus, without being attended with death&mdash;that he was rea|dy to demon&s;trate the in&s;ertion of the mu&s;cle to Mr. Brag|well, but de&s;ired to have no concern with the experiment, which might e&s;&s;entially prejudice his reputation in ca&s;e of a mi&s;carriage. Bragwell was as much impo&s;ed upon by
<PB N="75" REF="027715_0316_0FD5EDF91E81D080">
the painter's waggery as the doctor, and declined engag|ing in the affair, &s;aying, he had a very great regard for Mr. Slyboot, but had laid it down as a maxim, never to fight except when his honour was engaged. A thou&s;and jokes of this kind were pa&s;&s;ed; the wine circulated, &s;up|per was &s;erved in, we ate heartily, returned to the bottle; Bragwell became noi&s;y and trouble&s;ome, Banter grew more and more &s;evere, Ranter rehear&s;ed, Slyboot made faces at the whole company, I &s;ung French catches, and Chatter ki&s;&s;ed me with great affection; while the doctor, with a woeful countenance, &s;at &s;ilent like a di&s;ciple of Pythagoras. At length it was propo&s;ed by Bragwell, that we &s;hould &s;cour the hundreds, &s;weat the con&s;table, maul the watch, and then reel &s;oberly to bed.</P>
<P>While we deliberated on this expedition, the waiter came into the room, and a&s;ked for Dr. Wagtail; when he under&s;tood he was pre&s;ent, he told him there was a lady below to inquire for him; at which the phy&s;ician &s;tarted from his melancholy contemplation, and, with a look of extreme confu&s;ion, a&s;&s;ured the company he could not po&s;|&s;ibly be the per&s;on wanted; for he had no connection with any lady whatever&mdash;and bid the drawer tell her &s;o. <Q>For &s;hame!</Q> cried Banter, <Q>would you be &s;o impolite as to refu&s;e the lady a hearing? perhaps &s;he comes for a con&s;ultation&mdash;it mu&s;t be &s;ome extraordinary affair that brings a lady to a tavern at this time o'night. Mr. Ranter, pray do the doctor's <HI>bai&s;e-mains</HI> to the lady, and &s;quire her hither.</Q> The player immediately &s;tag|gered out, and returned, leading in, with much ceremony, a tall &s;trapping wench, who&s;e appearance proclaimed her occupation. We received her with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity, and with a good deal of entreaty &s;he was per&s;uaded to &s;it, when a profound &s;ilence en&s;ued, during which &s;he fixed her eyes, with a di&s;con&s;olate look upon the doctor, who was utterly confounded at her behaviour, and returned her melancholy four-fold; at length, after a good many pi|teous &s;ighs, &s;he wiped her eyes, and acco&s;ted him thus: <Q>What, not one word of comfort? will nothing &s;often that &s;tony heart of thine? Not all my tears! not all my afflictions! not the inevitable ruin thou ha&s;t brought upon me! Where are thy vows, thou faithle&s;s, perjured man?&mdash;Ha&s;t thou no honour&mdash;no con&s;cience&mdash;no re|mor&s;e for thy perfidious conduct towards me!&mdash;An&s;wer

me&mdash;wilt thou at la&s;t do me ju&s;tice, or mu&s;t I have re|cour&s;e to heaven or hell for my revenge!</Q> If poor Wagtail was amazed before &s;he &s;poke, what mu&s;t his con|fu&s;ion be on hearing this addre&s;s! His natural palene&s;s changed into a gha&s;tly clay colour, his eyes rolled, his lip trembled, and he an&s;wered in an accent not to be de&s;cri|bed; <Q>Upon my word, honour, and &s;alvation! Madam, you are actually mi&s;taken in my per&s;on. I have a mo&s;t particular veneration for your &s;ex, Madam, and am actually incapable of injuring any lady in the &s;malle&s;t de|gree, Madam&mdash;be&s;ides, Madam, to the be&s;t of my recol|lection, I never had the honour of &s;eeing you before, as I hope to be &s;aved, Madam.</Q>&mdash;"How, traitor!" cried &s;he, <Q>do&s;t thou di&s;own me then?&mdash;Mi&s;taken! no&mdash;too well I know that fair bewitching face! too well I know that fal&s;e enchanting tongue! Alas! gentlemen, &s;ince the villain compels me by his unkindne&s;s to expo&s;e my|&s;elf and him, know, that this betrayer, under the &s;pe|cious pretence of honourable addre&s;&s;es, won my heart, and, taking advantage of his conque&s;t, robbed me of my virgin trea&s;ure, and afterwards abandoned me to my fate!&mdash;I am now four months gone with child by him, turned out of doors by my relations, and left a prey to mi&s;ery and want!&mdash;Yes, thou barbarian,</Q> &s;aid &s;he, turning to Wagtail, <Q>thou tiger, thou &s;uccubus! too well thou knowe&s;t my &s;ituation&mdash;but I will tear out thy faithle&s;s heart, and deliver the world from &s;uch a mon&s;ter.</Q> So &s;aying, &s;he &s;prang forward at the doctor, who with incredible agility jumped over the table, and ran behind Bragwell, while the re&s;t of us endeavoured to appea&s;e the furious heroine. Although every body in the company affected the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, I could ea&s;ily per|ceive it was a &s;cheme concerted among them to produce diver&s;ion at the doctor's expence; and, being under no concern about the con&s;equence, I entered into the confe|deracy, and enjoyed the di&s;tre&s;s of Wagtail, who with tears in his eyes begged the protection of the company, declaring him&s;elf as innocent of the crime laid to his charge as the <HI>foetus in utero,</HI> and hinting at the &s;ame time, that nature had not put it in his power to be guilty of &s;uch a tre&s;pa&s;s&mdash;"Nature!" cried the lady; there was no <Q>nature in the ca&s;e&mdash;he abu&s;ed me by the help of charms

and &s;pells, el&s;e how is it po&s;&s;ible, that any woman could have li&s;tened to the addre&s;&s;es of &s;uch a &s;care-crow!&mdash;Were the&s;e owli&s;h eyes made for ogling, that carrion complexion to be admired, or that mouth, like a hor&s;e|&s;hoe, to be ki&s;&s;ed? No, no, you owe your &s;ucce&s;s to your philtres, to your drugs and incantations, and not to your natural talents, which are in every re&s;pect mean and contemptible?</Q> The doctor now thought he had got an opportunity of vindicating him&s;elf effectually, and de&s;ired the complainant to compo&s;e her&s;elf but for half an hour, in which he undertook to prove the ab&s;urdity of be|lieving in the power of incantations, which were only idle dreams of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition. He accordingly pronounced a very learned di&s;cour&s;e upon the nature of ideas, the powers and independence of the mind, the pro|perties of &s;timulating medicines, the difference between a pronene&s;s to venery, which many &s;imples would create, and a pa&s;&s;ion limited to one object, which can only be the re&s;ult of &s;en&s;e and reflection, and concluded with a pathe|tic remon&s;trance, &s;etting forth his unhappine&s;s in being per&s;ecuted with the re&s;entment of a lady whom he had ne|ver injured, nor even &s;een before that occa&s;ion, and who&s;e faculties were, in all likelihood, &s;o much impaired by her misfortunes, that an innocent per&s;on was in danger of being ruined by her di&s;order. He had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed his harangue than the forlorn prince&s;s renewed her la|mentations, and cautioned the company again&s;t his elo|quence, which, &s;he &s;aid, was able to bias the mo&s;t im|partial bench in Chri&s;tendom. Banter advi&s;ed him to e&s;|pou&s;e her immediately as the only means to &s;alve his re|putation, and offered to accompany him to the Fleet for that purpo&s;e; but Slyboot propo&s;ed, that a father &s;hould be purcha&s;ed for the child, and a comfortable alimony &s;et|tled on the mother. Ranter promi&s;ed to adopt the infant <HI>gratis.</HI> Wagtail was ready to wor&s;hip him for his gene|ro&s;ity; and though he per&s;i&s;ted in prote&s;ting his inno|cence, conde&s;cended to every thing rather than his unble|mi&s;hed character &s;hould be called in que&s;tion.&mdash;The lady rejected the propo&s;al, and in&s;i&s;ted on matrimony. Brag|well took up the cudgels for the doctor, and undertook to rid him of her importunity for half a guinea; upon which Wagtail, with great eagerne&s;s, pulled out his pur&s;e,
<PB N="78" REF="027715_0319_0FD5EE019E47E078">
and put it into the hand of his friend, who, taking half a piece out of it, gave it to the plaintiff, and bid her thank God for her good fortune. When &s;he had received this bounty, &s;he affected to weep, and begged, &s;ince the phy|&s;ician had renounced her, he would at lea&s;t vouch&s;afe her a parting ki&s;s; this he was prevailed upon to grant with great reluctance, and went up with his u&s;ual &s;olemnity to &s;alute her, when &s;he laid hold of his check with her teeth, and held fa&s;t, while he roared with angui&s;h, to the un|&s;peakable diver&s;ion of all pre&s;ent. When &s;he thought pro|per to relea&s;e him, &s;he dropped a low court&s;ey to the com|pany, and quitted the room, leaving the doctor in the utmo&s;t horror, not &s;o much on account of the pain, as the apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;equence of the bite; for by this time he was convinced of her being mad. Banter pre&s;cri|bed the actual cautery, and put the poker in the fire to be heated, in order to fear the place. The player was of opi|nion, that Bragwell &s;hould &s;coop out the part affected with the point of his &s;word; but the painter prevented both the&s;e dreadful operations by recommending a bal&s;am he had in his pocket, which never failed to cure the bite of a mad dog: &s;o &s;aying, he pulled out a &s;mall bladder of black paint, with which he in&s;tantly anointed not only the &s;ore but the greate&s;t part of the patient's face, and left it in a frightful condition. In &s;hort, the poor creature was &s;o harra&s;&s;ed with fear and vexation, that I pitied him extreme|ly, and &s;ent him home in a chair, contrary to the inclina|tion of every body pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>This freedom of mine gave umbrage to Bragwell, who te&s;tified his di&s;plea&s;ure by &s;wearing a few threats, with|out making application; which was no &s;ooner perceiv|ed by Mr. Slyboot, who &s;at by me, than with a view of promoting a quarrel, he whi&s;pered to me, that he thought Bragwell u&s;ed me very ill; but every man was the be&s;t judge of his own affairs.&mdash;I an&s;wered aloud, that I would neither &s;uffer Mr. Bragwell nor him to u&s;e me ill with impunity; and that I &s;tood in no need of his coun&s;el in regard to the regulation of my conduct.&mdash;He thought proper to a&s;k a thou&s;and pardons, and a&s;&s;ured me, he meant no offence; while Bragwell feigned him|&s;elf a&s;leep, that he might not be obliged to take notice of what pa&s;&s;ed. But the player, who had more animal &s;pi|rits,

and le&s;s di&s;cretion than Slyboot, unwilling to let the affair re&s;t, where he had dropt it, jogged Mr. Bragwell, and told him &s;oftly, that I called him names, and threa|tened to cudgel him.&mdash;This I under&s;tood by his &s;tarting up and crying, <Q>Blood and wounds! you lie&mdash;No man dur&s;t treat me &s;o ignominiou&s;ly: Mr. Random, did you call me names, and threaten to drub me?</Q> I de|nied the imputation, and propo&s;ed to puni&s;h the &s;coun|drel, who endeavoured to foment di&s;turbance in the com|pany; Bragwell &s;ignified his approbation, and drew his &s;word; I did the &s;ame, and acco&s;ted the actor in the&s;e words, <Q>Lookee, Mr. Ranter, I know you po&s;&s;e&s;s all the mimickry and mi&s;chievous qualities of an ape, becau&s;e I have ob&s;erved you put them all in practice more than once to-night on me and others; now I want to &s;ee if you re&s;emble one in nimblene&s;s al&s;o; therefore I de&s;ire you to leap over this &s;word without he&s;itation;</Q> &s;o &s;aying, I held it parallel to the horizon, at the di&s;tance of about three feet from the floor, and cal|led, "Once&mdash;twice&mdash;thrice, and away;"&mdash;but in&s;tead of complying with my commands, he &s;natched his hat and hanger, and a&s;&s;uming the look, &s;wagger, and phra&s;e of Pi&s;tol, bur&s;t out into the following exclamation: <Q>Ha! mu&s;t I then perform inglorious prank, of Sylvan ape in mountain fore&s;t caught! Death rock me a&s;leep, abridge my doleful days, and lay my head in fury's lap&mdash;Have we not Hieren here?</Q>&mdash;This buffoonery did not an|&s;wer his expectation, for by this time the company was bent on &s;eeing him in a new character.

that he may at once deliver him&s;elf from the importu|nities of the mother, and the expence of her bantling; for which rea&s;on I would not have you tru&s;t implicitly to the report he makes of her wealth, which is incon|&s;i&s;tent with his behaviour; nor run your head precipi|tately into a noo&s;e, that you may afterwards wi&s;h ex|changed for the hangman's.</Q>&mdash;He &s;eemed very much &s;tartled at my in&s;inuation, and promi&s;ed to look twice be|fore he leaped; &s;aying, with &s;ome heat, <Q>Odds, if I find his intention is to betray me, we &s;hall &s;ee which of us is the better man.</Q>&mdash;My prediction was verified in le&s;s than a fortnight; her great belly producing an infant, to the un&s;peakable amazement of Strap, who was, before this happened, inclinable to believe I had refined a little too much in my penetration.

<P>Meanwhile I met my friend Banter at the ordinary, and in the evening went to the opera with him and Mr. Chatter, who pointed out Melinda in one of the boxes, and offered to introduce me to her, ob&s;erving at the &s;ame time, that &s;he was a reigning toa&s;t, worth ten thou|&s;and pounds.&mdash;This piece of information made my heart bound with joy, and I di&s;covered great eagerne&s;s to ac|cept the propo&s;al; upon which he a&s;&s;ured me I &s;hould dance with her at the next a&s;&s;embly, if he had any influ|ence in that quarter; &s;o &s;aying, he went round, &s;poke to her &s;ome minutes, and, as I imagined, pointed at me; then returning, told me, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure, that I might depend upon what he had promi&s;ed, for &s;he was now engaged as my partner.&mdash;Banter, in a whi&s;per, gave me to under&s;tand, that &s;he was an incorrigible coquette, who would grant the &s;ame favour to any young fellow in England, of a tolerable appearance, merely to engage him among the herd of her admirers, that &s;he might have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them daily increa&s;e;&mdash;that &s;he was of a cold in&s;en&s;ible di&s;po&s;ition, dead to every pa&s;&s;ion but vanity, and &s;o blind to merit, that he would lay any wa|ger, the wealthie&s;t fool &s;hould carry her at la&s;t. I attri|buted a good deal of this intelligence to the &s;atirical turn of my friend, or re&s;entment for having him&s;elf &s;uffered a

<P>Full of this confidence I repaired to Hamp&s;tead, in company with Billy Chatter, my Lord Hobble, and Doc|tor Wagtail. Here I &s;aw a very brilliant a&s;&s;embly, be|fore whom I had the honour to walk a minuet with Me|linda, who charmed me with her frank manner and ea&s;ine&s;s of behaviour.&mdash;Before the country dances be|gan, I received a me&s;&s;age by a per&s;on, I did not know, from Bragwell, who was pre&s;ent, importing, that no|body, who knew him, pre&s;umed to dance with Melinda while he was there in per&s;on; and that I would do well to relinqui&s;h her without noi&s;e, becau&s;e he had a mind to lead up a country dance with her. This extraordinary in|timation, which was delivered in the lady's hearing, did not at all di&s;compo&s;e me, who by this time was pretty well acquainted with the character of my rival. I there|fore without the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of concern, bid the gen|tleman tell Mr. Bragwell, that &s;ince I was &s;o happy as to obtain the lady's con&s;ent, I &s;hould not be &s;olicitous about his; and de&s;ired the bearer him&s;elf to bring me no &s;uch impertinent me&s;&s;ages for the future. Melinda affect|ed a &s;ort of confu&s;ion, and pretended to wonder that Mr. Bragwell &s;hould give him&s;elf &s;uch liberties, with regard to her, who had no manner of connection with the fellow. I laid hold of this opportunity to di&s;play my valour, and offered to call him to an account for his in&s;olence, which &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, under pretence of con&s;ulting my &s;afety; though I could perceive by the &s;parkling of her eyes, that &s;he would not have thought her&s;elf affronted in being the &s;ubject of a duel. I was by no means plea|&s;ed with this di&s;covery of her thoughts, which not only argued the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable vanity, but likewi&s;e the mo&s;t barbarous indifference; however, I was allured by her fortune, and re&s;olved to gratify her pride, in making her the occa&s;ion of a public quarrel between me and Bragwell, who, I was pretty certain, would never drive matters to a dangerous extremity.</P>
<P>While we danced together, I ob&s;erved this formidable rival at one end of the room, encircled with a clu&s;ter of beaux, to whom he talked with great vehemence, ca&s;ting
<PB N="84" REF="027715_0325_0FD5EE111ECCA8A8">
many big looks at me from time to time: I gue&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e, and as &s;oon as I had handed my partner to her &s;eat, &s;trutted up to the place where he &s;tood, and cocking my hat in his face, demanded aloud, if he had any thing to &s;ay to me. He an&s;wered with a &s;ullen tone, "Nothing at pre&s;ent, Sir," and turned about upon his heel.&mdash;"Well," &s;aid I, <Q>you know where I am to be found at any time.</Q>&mdash;His companions &s;tared at one another, and I returned to the lady, who&s;e features brightened at my approach, and immediately a whi&s;per ran through the whole room; after which, &s;o many eyes were turned upon me, that I was ready to &s;ink with con|fu&s;ion.&mdash;When the ball broke up, I led her to her coach, and, like a true French gallant, would have got up be|hind it, in order to protect her from violence on the road; but &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed my offer, and expre&s;&s;ed her con|cern that there was not an empty &s;eat for me within it.</P>
<P>Next day in the afternoon, I waited on her at her lodgings, by permi&s;&s;ion, in company with Chatter, and was very civilly received by her mother, with whom &s;he lived;&mdash;there were a good many fa&s;hionable people pre|&s;ent, chiefly young fellows; and immediately after tea, a couple of card tables were &s;et, at one of which I had the honour to play with Melinda, who in le&s;s than three hours made &s;hift to plunder me of eight guineas.&mdash;I was well enough content to lo&s;e a little money with a good grace, that I might have an opportunity to &s;ay &s;oft things in the mean time, which are &s;till more welcome, when at|tended with good luck; but I was by no means &s;atisfied with her fair play, a circum&s;tance that &s;hocked me not a little, and greatly impaired my opinion of her di&s;intere&s;t|edne&s;s and delicacy.&mdash;However, I was re&s;olved to profit by this behaviour, and treat her in my turn with le&s;s ce|remony; accordingly I laid clo&s;e &s;iege to her, and finding her not at all di&s;gu&s;ted with the gro&s;s incen&s;e I offered, that very night made a declaration of love in plain terms.&mdash;She received my addre&s;&s;es with great gaiety, and pre|tended to laugh them off, but at the &s;ame time treated me with &s;uch particular complacency, that I was per&s;uad|ed I had made a conque&s;t of her heart, and concluded my&s;elf the happie&s;t man alive. Elevated with the&s;e flatter|ing ideas, I &s;at down again to cards after &s;upper, and with

<P>It was late before I took my leave, after being favour|ed with a general invitation; and when I got into bed, the adventures of the day hindered me from &s;leeping.&mdash;Sometimes I plea&s;ed my&s;elf with the hopes of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a fine woman with ten thou&s;and pounds; then I would ru|minate on the character I had heard of her from Banter, and compare it with the circum&s;tances of her conduct to|wards me, which &s;eemed to bear too great a re&s;emblance to the picture he had drawn.&mdash;This introduced a melan|choly reflection on the expence I had undergone, and the &s;mallne&s;s of my funds to &s;upport it, which, by the bye, were none of my own.&mdash;In &s;hort, I found my&s;elf involved in doubts and perplexit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s, that kept me awake the great|e&s;t part of the night.</P>
<P>In the morning, Strap, with whom I had not conver|&s;ed for two days, pre&s;ented him&s;elf with the uten&s;ils for &s;having me; upon which, I a&s;ked his opinion of the lady whom he had &s;een me conduct to her coach at Hamp&s;tead.&mdash;"Odd! &s;he's a delicious creature," cried he, <Q>and, as I am informed, a great fortune.&mdash;I am &s;orry you did not in&s;i&s;t on going home with her.&mdash;I dare &s;ay, &s;he would not have refu&s;ed your company; for &s;he &s;eems to be a good-humoured &s;oul.</Q>&mdash;<Q>There's a time for all things,</Q> &s;aid I. <Q>You mu&s;t know, Strap, I was in company with her till one o'clock this morning.</Q>&mdash;I had no &s;ooner pronounced the&s;e words, than he began to caper about the room, and &s;nap his fingers, crying in a tran&s;port, "The day's our own!&mdash;The day's our own!" I gave him to under&s;tand that his triumph was a little premature, and that I had more difficulties to &s;urmount than he was aware of; then I recounted to him the intel|ligence I had received from Banter.&mdash;At which he chang|ed colour, &s;hook his head, and ob&s;erved there was no faith in woman.&mdash;I told him, I was re&s;olved to make a bold pu&s;h notwith&s;tanding, although I fore&s;aw it would lead me into a great expence; and bid him gue&s;s the &s;um I had lo&s;t la&s;t night at cards.&mdash;He &s;cratched his chin, and profe&s;&s;ed his abhorrence of cards, the very name of which being mentioned made him &s;weat with vexation, as it re|called the money-dropper to his remembrance; <Q>But

<P>This good creature's unalterable friend&s;hip for me, af|fected me with the mo&s;t grateful &s;entiments, and acted as a &s;pur to my re&s;olution of acquiring a fortune, that I might have it in my power to manife&s;t my genero&s;ity in my turn&mdash;For this purpo&s;e, I determined to bring mat|ters to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion with Melinda, well knowing that a few &s;uch nights as the la&s;t, would effectually inca|pacitate me from pro&s;ecuting that, or any other advanta|geous amour.</P>

But Medlar pleaded cu&s;tom in be|half of <HI>c.</HI> ob&s;erving, that by the doctor's rule we ought to change pudding into budding, becau&s;e it is derived from the French word <HI>boudin;</HI> and, in that ca&s;e, why not re|tain the original orthography and pronunciation of all the foreign words we have adopted, by which means our lan|guage would become a di&s;&s;onant jargon without &s;tandard or propriety? The controver&s;y was referred to us; and Banter, notwith&s;tanding his real opinion to the contrary, decided in favour of Wagtail: upon which the peevi&s;h an|nuitant aro&s;e, and uttering the mono&s;yllable "Pi&s;h" with great empha&s;is, removed to another table.</P>
<P>We then inquired of the doctor what progre&s;s he had made in the experiment of di&s;tilling tinder-water? and he told us he had been at all the gla&s;s-hou&s;es about town, but could find nobody who would undertake to blow a retort large enough to hold the third part of the quan|tity pre&s;cribed; but he intended to try the proce&s;s on as much as would produce five drops, which would be &s;ufficient to prove the &s;pecific, and then he would make it a parliamentary affair&mdash;that he had already purcha&s;ed a con&s;iderable weight of rags, in reducing of which to tin|der he had met with a misfortune which had obliged him to change his lodgings; for he had gathered them in a heap on the floor, and &s;et fire to them with a candle, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the board would &s;u&s;tain no damage,
<PB N="90" REF="027715_0331_0FD5EE1DE085FD20">
becau&s;e it is the nature of the flame to a&s;cend; but by &s;ome very extraordinary accident the wood was invaded, and began to blaze with great violence, which di&s;ordered him &s;o much, that he had not pre&s;ence of mind enough to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the whole hou&s;e mu&s;t have been con|&s;umed with him in the mid&s;t of it, had not the &s;moke that rolled out of the windows in clouds alarmed the neigh|bourhood, and brought people to his &s;uccour&mdash;that he had lo&s;t a pair of black velvet breeches and a tye-wig in the hurry, be&s;ides the expence of the rags, which were rendered u&s;ele&s;s by the water u&s;ed to quench the flame, and the damage of the floor, which he was compelled to repair&mdash;that his landlord, believing him di&s;tracted, had in&s;i&s;ted on his quitting his apartment at a minute's warn|ing, which put him to incredible inconvenience; but now he was &s;ettled in a very comfortable hou&s;e, and had the u&s;e of a large paved yard for preparing his tinder; &s;o that he hoped in a very &s;hort time to reap the fruits of his labour.</P>
<P>After having congratulated the doctor on his pro&s;pect, and read the papers, we repaired to an auction of pictures, where we entertained our&s;elves an hour or two; from thence we adjourned to the Mall, and, after two or three turns, went back to dinner, Banter a&s;&s;uring us, that he intended to roa&s;t Medlar at the ordinary; and indeed we were no &s;ooner &s;et than this cynic began to execute his purpo&s;e, by telling the old gentleman he looked extremely well, con&s;idering the little &s;leep he had enjoyed la&s;t night. To this compliment Medlar made no reply but by a &s;tare, accompanied with a &s;ignificant grin; and Banter went on thus: <Q>I don't know whether mo&s;t to admire the cha|rity of your mind or the vigour of your body. Upon my &s;oul, Mr. Medlar, you do generous things with the be&s;t ta&s;te of any man I know! You extend your com|pa&s;&s;ion to real objects, and exact only &s;uch returns as they are capable of making. You mu&s;t know, gentle|men,</Q> &s;aid he, turning to the company, <Q>I had been up mo&s;t part of the night with a friend who is ill of a fever, and, on my return home this morning, I chan|ced to pa&s;s by a gin-&s;hop, &s;till open, whence i&s;&s;ued a confu&s;ed &s;ound of mirth and jollity: upon which, I pop|ped in my head, and perceived Mr. Medlar dancing
<PB N="91" REF="027715_0332_0FD5EE1FCED005D0">
bare-headed in the mid&s;t of ten or twenty ragged bun|ters, who rejoiced at his expence. But indeed, Mr. Medlar, you ought not to &s;acrifice your con&s;titution to your benevolence&mdash;con&s;ider you grow old apace, and&punc; therefore ought to have a reverend care of your health, which mu&s;t certainly be very much impaired by the&s;e nocturnal expeditions.</Q> The te&s;ty &s;enior could no long|er contain him&s;elf, but cried ha&s;tily, <Q>'Tis well known that your tongue is no &s;lander.</Q>&mdash;"I think," &s;aid the other, <Q>you might &s;pare that ob&s;ervation, as you are very &s;en&s;ible that my tongue has done you &s;ignal &s;ervice on many occa&s;ions. You may remember that, when you made your addre&s;&s;es to the fat widow who kept a pub|lic-hou&s;e at I&s;lington, there was a report &s;pread, very much to the prejudice of your manhood, which coming to the ears of your mi&s;tre&s;s, you were di&s;carded imme|diately; and I brought matters to a reconciliation, by a&s;&s;uring her you had three ba&s;tards at nur&s;e in the coun|try: how you ruined your affairs afterwards, it is nei|ther my bu&s;ine&s;s nor inclination to relate.</Q> This anec|dote, which had no other foundation than in Banter's own invention, afforded a good deal of mirth to every per&s;on pre&s;ent, and provoked Mr. Medlar beyond all &s;uf|ferance; &s;o that he &s;tarted up in a mighty pa&s;&s;ion, and, forgetting that his mouth was full, be&s;pattered tho&s;e who &s;at next him, while he di&s;charged his indignation in a vol|ley of oaths, and called Banter in&s;ignificant puppy, imper|tinent jackanapes, and a hundred &s;uch appellations, telling the company he had invented the&s;e fal&s;e malicious a&s;per&s;ions, becau&s;e he would not lend him money to &s;quander away upon rooks and whores.&mdash;"A very likely &s;tory," &s;aid Ban|ter, <Q>that I &s;hould attempt to borrow money of a man who is obliged to practi&s;e a thou&s;and &s;hifts to make his weekly allowance hold out till Saturday's night. Some|times he &s;leeps four and twenty hours at a &s;tretch, by which means he &s;aves three meals, be&s;ides coffee-hou&s;e expence&mdash;&s;ometimes he is fain to put up with bread and chee&s;e, and &s;mall beer, for dinner&mdash;and &s;ometimes he regales on two pennyworth of ox-chee&s;e in a cellar.</Q>&mdash;"You are a lying mi&s;creant," cried Medlar, in an exta&s;y of rage; <Q>I can always command money enough to pay your taylor's bill, which I am &s;ure is no trifle; and I
<PB N="92" REF="027715_0333_0FD5EE220195F1E0">
have a good mind to give you a convincing proof of my circum&s;tances by pro&s;ecuting you for defamation, &s;irrah.</Q> By this time the violence of his wrath had de|prived him of his appetite, and he &s;at &s;ilent, unable to &s;wallow one mouthful, while his tormentor enjoyed his mortification and increa&s;ed his chagrin by advi&s;ing him to lay in plentifully for his next day's fa&s;t.</P>
<P>Dinner being ended, we came do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tairs to the coffee-room, and Banter went away to keep an appointment, &s;aying, he &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hould &s;ee Wagtail and me in the evening at the Bedford coffee-hou&s;e.&mdash;He was no &s;ooner gone, than the old gentleman took me a&s;ide, and &s;aid he was &s;orry to &s;ee me &s;o intimate with that fellow, who was one of the mo&s;t gracele&s;s rakes about town, and had al|ready wa&s;ted a good e&s;tate and con&s;titution upon harlots. That he had been the ruin of many a young man, by in|troducing them into debauched company, and &s;etting a lewd example of all manner of wickedne&s;s; and that un|le&s;s I was on my guard, he would &s;trip me in a &s;hort time both of my money and reputation. I thanked him for his information, and promi&s;ed to conduct my&s;elf ac|cordingly, wi&s;hing, however, his caution had been a few hours more early, by which means I might have &s;aved five guineas. Notwith&s;tanding this intelligence, I was inclinable to impute &s;ome part of this charge to Medlar's revenge for the liberties taken with him at dinner, and therefore, as &s;oon as I could di&s;engage my&s;elf, applied to Wagtail for his opinion of the character in que&s;tion, re|&s;olved to compare their accounts, allowing for the preju|dice of each, and form my judgment upon both, without adhering &s;trictly to either. The doctor a&s;&s;ured me, that he was a very pretty gentleman of family and fortune, a &s;cholar, a wit, a critic, and perfectly well acquainted with the town; that his honour and courage were un|que&s;tionable, though &s;ome extravagances he had been guil|ty of, and his talent for &s;atire, had procured him enemies, and made &s;ome people &s;hy of his acquaintance. From the&s;e different &s;ketches I concluded, that Banter was a young fellow of &s;ome parts, who had &s;pent his fortune, but re|tained his appetites, and fallen out with the world, be|cau&s;e he could not enjoy it to his wi&s;h.</P>
<P>I went to the Bedford coffee-hou&s;e in the evening,
<PB N="93" REF="027715_0334_0FD5EE256DBF1328">
where I met my friends, from thence proceeded to the play, and afterwards carried them home to my lodgings, where we &s;upped with great harmony and &s;atisfaction.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>I receive a challenge&mdash;the con&s;equences of it&mdash;the quarrel being made up, I am put in arre&s;t by the care and affec|tion of Strap, but immediately relea&s;ed upon explaining my affair&mdash;the behaviour of Mr. O'Regan and his two friends&mdash;I vi&s;it Melinda, whom I divert with an account of the duel&mdash;propo&s;e marriage&mdash;&s;he refers the matter to her mother, of whom I make a &s;olemn demand of her daugh|ter&mdash;the old lady's behaviour&mdash;I am di&s;carded, re&s;ent their di&s;dain.</P>

<P>WHEN I was ready to go abroad next day, Strap brought me a letter, directed <HI>To Mr. Random, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> Tho&s;e</HI>&mdash;Which, upon opening, I found contained a chal|lenge, couched in the&s;e very extraordinary terms:</P>

<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ROURK O'REGAN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I gue&s;&s;ed from the &s;tyle and &s;ub&s;cription of this billet, that my rival was true Mile&s;ian, and was not a little un|ea&s;y at the contents, e&s;pecially that part, in which he a&s;|&s;erted his right to my mi&s;tre&s;s by promi&s;e, a circum&s;tance I did not know how to reconcile to her penetration.&mdash;How|ever, this was no time for me to decline the defiance, becau&s;e the &s;ucce&s;s of my addre&s;&s;es might in a great mea|&s;ure depend upon my behaviour in that affair. I there|fore immediately loaded my pi&s;tols, and betook my&s;elf in
<PB N="94" REF="027715_0335_0FD5EE26DF409470">
a hackney-coach to the place appointed, where I found a tall, raw-boned man, with a hard featured countenance, and black bu&s;hy beard, walking by him&s;elf, wrapped up in a &s;habby great coat, over which his own hair de&s;cend|ed in a leathern queue from his head, that was covered with a grea&s;y hat trimmed with a tarni&s;hed <HI>point d' F&s;pagne.</HI> He no &s;ooner perceived me advancing, than without any preamble, he pulled a pi&s;tol from his bo&s;om, and pre&s;ent|ing at me, &s;napt it. Alarmed at this rude &s;alutation, I made a &s;tand, and before he could adju&s;t his other piece, fired one of mine at him, without doing any damage. By this time he was ready with his &s;econd, which fla&s;hed in the pan without going off: upon which he called with a true Tipperary cadence, "Fire away, honey,"&mdash;and be|gan to hammer his flint with great deliberation.&mdash;But I was re&s;olved to make u&s;e of the advantage fortune had given me; and therefore &s;tept up, without throwing away my fire, de&s;iring him to a&s;k his life, or prepare for ano|ther world; but this &s;tout Hibernian refu&s;ed to conde|&s;cend, and complained bitterly of my having quitted my ground before he could return my &s;hot, &s;aying, I ought to go back to my &s;tation, and let him have an equal chance with me.&mdash;I endeavoured to per&s;uade him that I had given him a double chance already; and it was my bu&s;ine&s;s to prevent him from enjoying a third;&mdash;but now, &s;ince I had an opportunity, I demanded a parley, and de&s;ired to know the condition, and rea&s;on for calling me to the field, who, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, &s;o far from having done him an injury, had never before &s;een him.&mdash;He told me, that he was a gentleman of fortune, who had &s;pent all he had, and hearing that Melinda had got ten thou&s;and pounds, he intended to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of that &s;um by e&s;pou&s;ing her, and was determined in an honourable way, to cut the throats of all tho&s;e who &s;tood between him and his hopes.&mdash;I then demanded to know the foundation of his hopes; and now that I had &s;een him, being more and more a&s;toni&s;hed at the circum|&s;tance of the promi&s;e, de&s;ired he would explain that my|&s;tery.&mdash;He gave me to under&s;tand that he tru&s;ted entirely to his birth and per&s;onal merit; that he had frequently written to Melinda, &s;etting forth his claim and preten&s;ions, but &s;he was never kind enough to &s;end an an&s;wer, or even
<PB N="95" REF="027715_0336_0FD5EE2857D24058">
to admit him into her pre&s;ence; and that the promi&s;e he mentioned in his letter was made by his friend Mr. Gag|hagan, who a&s;&s;ured him, that no woman could re&s;i&s;t a man of his appearance. I could not forbear laughing to exce&s;s at the &s;implicity of my rival, who did not &s;eem to reli&s;h my mirth, but began to be very &s;erious: upon which I endeavoured to appea&s;e him by giving him my word and honour, that &s;o far from prejudicing his addre&s;&s;es to the lady, I would repre&s;ent him to her in the mo&s;t fa|vourable light I could, with any regard to truth; but he mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed if &s;he &s;hould remain blind to his de|&s;erts, for nothing was more capricious than a woman's mind, and the affection of that &s;ex was &s;eldom purcha&s;ed with virtue alone.&mdash;That my declaration might have the better effect, I took notice of his di&s;habille, and profe&s;|&s;ing &s;orrow at &s;eeing a gentleman reduced, &s;lipped two guineas into his hand, at the &s;ight of which he threw away his pi&s;tols, and hugging me in his arms, cried, <Q>Arrah, by Je&s;us, now you are the be&s;t friend I have met with the&s;e &s;even long years.</Q>&mdash;When I had &s;uffer|ed &s;ome minutes in his embrace, he quitted me, and picking up his ru&s;ty arms, wi&s;hed the devil might burn him, if ever he &s;hould give me any further trouble about womankind.</P>
<P>The quarrel being thus amicably compo&s;ed, I begged leave to look at his pi&s;tols, which I found &s;o crazy and &s;o foul, that I believe it was happy for him neither of them was di&s;charged, for one of them would certainly have &s;plit in the going off, and he would in all probability have lo&s;t his hand in the explo&s;ion; but what gave me a lively idea of the man's character was to find upon exami|nation, that one of them had been loaded without being primed, and the other primed without a charge.</P>
<P>While we walked homeward together, I expre&s;&s;ed a de|&s;ire of knowing my new friend's hi&s;tory; and he informed me of his having &s;erved in the German army as a volun|teer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Turks; that for his behaviour at the &s;iege of Belgrade, he had been honoured with an en&s;ign's com|mi&s;&s;ion, and afterwards promoted to the rank of lieute|nant, in which &s;tation, it was his misfortune to affront his captain, who challenged him to the field, and was killed in the duel, upon which he was obliged to retreat;&mdash;that
<PB N="96" REF="027715_0337_0FD5EE29FB002040">
he had been in England &s;ome years &s;oliciting his friends for provi&s;ion in the Briti&s;h army; but being hitherto un|&s;ucce&s;sful, he was de&s;ired by Mr. Gaghagan to turn his thoughts to matrimony, and make his fortune by an ad|vantageous match; in con&s;equence of which advice he had made up to Melinda; and having heard by means of an Iri&s;h footman in the family, that I was her chief favour|ite, had called me out, in hopes of removing, by my death, the greate&s;t ob&s;truction to his de&s;ires; but now he was convinced of my honour and genero&s;ity, he &s;wore by the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, he would think of her no more if there was not another woman in the world.&mdash;As a further proof of his veracity, which I did not at all doubt, he opened an old iron &s;nuff-box, and pulled out his commi&s;&s;ion in the Imperial army, and his captain's challenge, which he pre&s;erved as te&s;timonials of his character.&mdash;I was &s;o well convinced of this poor man's hone&s;ty and courage, that I determined to &s;peak in his behalf to &s;ome of my acquaint|ance, who might recommend his ca&s;e to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e who could provide for him; and in the mean time to accommodate him with a few clothes, by which his appearance would be much mended, and him&s;elf ena|bled to renew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;olicitations in per&s;on.</P>
<P>As we walked along conver&s;ing &s;ociably together, we were met by a file of mu&s;queteers, and Strap at their head, who no &s;ooner approached, than with a frantic look, he cried, <Q>Seize them!&mdash;In the name of God! &s;eize them!</Q>&mdash;We were accordingly &s;urrounded, and I put in arre&s;t by the corporal, who was commanding of|ficer; but Captain O'Regan di&s;engaged him&s;elf, and ran with &s;uch &s;peed towards Tottenham-court road, that he was out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight in a moment. When my arms were de|livered up, and my&s;elf &s;ecured, Strap became a little more compo&s;ed, and a&s;ked pardon for the liberty he had taken, which he hoped I would excu&s;e, as it proceeded from his affection; he then told me, that, &s;u&s;pecting the letter (which by the bye was brought by the author him&s;elf) contained &s;omething extraordinary, he had peeped through the key-hole, and &s;een me load my pi&s;tols; upon which he ran down to Whitehall, and applied to the officer on guard for a party to put me in arre&s;t; but before he re|turned, I was gone in a coach; that he had inquired
<PB N="97" REF="027715_0338_0FD5EE2B566F1A60">
which way I went, and having heard that duels were com|monly fought at the back of Montague-hou&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e con|ducted the guard to this place, where he thanked God for having found me &s;afe and &s;ound. I gave him to under|&s;tand that I forgave his officious concern for once, but cau|tioned him in pretty &s;evere terms from making me the &s;ubject of idle conver&s;ation for the future; then turning to the corporal, thanked him for his care, and gave him a crown to drink with his men, a&s;&s;uring him that the ren|contre was over long before he came up, and every thing compromi&s;ed, as he might have ob&s;erved by our behavi|our; as a farther proof of which, he would find upon ex|amination, that one of my pi&s;tols had been di&s;charged; but this civil per&s;on, without giving him&s;elf or me any further trouble, received the bounty with a thou&s;and bows and acknowledgments, and returning the pi&s;tols relea&s;ed me immediately.</P>
<P>He was not gone an hundred yards when my friend O'Regan came up, in order to re&s;cue me, with two Tat|terdemalions whom he had engaged for that purpo&s;e, about the purlieus of St. Giles's: one of them was armed with a mu&s;ket that wanted a lock, and another with a ru&s;ty broad-&s;word; but their dre&s;s &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all de&s;crip|tion.&mdash;When he under&s;tood I was already free, he made an apology for his abrupt departure, and introduced me to his two companions: fir&s;t, to Coun&s;ellor Fitzclab|ber, who, he told me, was then employed in compiling a hi&s;tory of the kings of Mun&s;ter, from Iri&s;h manu&s;cripts; and then to his friend Mr. Gaghagan, who was a profound philo&s;opher and politician, and had projected many ex|cellent &s;chemes for the good of his country.&mdash;But it &s;eems the&s;e literati had been very ill rewarded for their ingeni|ous labours; for between them both, there was but one &s;hirt, and half a pair of breeches.&mdash;I thanked them very kindly for their readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, and having offered my &s;ervice in my turn, bade them a good-morrow, de|&s;iring O'Regan to accompany me to my lodgings, where he was fitted with decent clothes from my wardrobe, &s;o much to his &s;atisfaction, that he &s;wore eternal gratitude and friend&s;hip to me, and, at my reque&s;t, recounted all the adventures of his life.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, I waited on Melinda, who received
<PB N="98" REF="027715_0339_0FD5EE495F5C2ED8">
me with great kindne&s;s and familiarity, and laughed ex|ce&s;&s;ively at my adventure with the Iri&s;hman, to who&s;e wi&s;hes &s;he was no &s;tranger, having more than a dozen letters in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which he had wrote to her on the &s;ubject of love, and which, for my entertainment, &s;he &s;ub|mitted to my peru&s;al.&mdash;Having made our&s;elves merry at the expence of this poor admirer, I &s;eized the opportuni|ty of her mother's going out of the room, and introduced my own pa&s;&s;ion, which I recommended to her with all the ardour and eloquence I was ma&s;ter of.&mdash;I flattered, &s;igh|ed, &s;wore, intreated, and acted a thou&s;and extravagancies in hopes of making &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on her heart; but &s;he heard every thing I &s;aid without di&s;covering the lea&s;t emotion; and other company came in, before &s;he would vouch&s;afe one &s;erious reply.&mdash;After tea, the cards were brought in, according to cu&s;tom, and it was my good fortune to have Melinda for my partner; by which means, in&s;tead of lo&s;ing, I came off with five guineas clear gain.</P>
<P>I &s;oon became acquainted with a good many people of fa&s;hion, and &s;pent my time in the modi&s;h diver&s;ions of the town, &s;uch as plays, operas, ma&s;querades, drums, a&s;&s;em|blies and puppet &s;hows: chiefly in company with Melin|da, whom I cultivated with all the eagerne&s;s and addre&s;s that my pro&s;pect could in&s;pire, and my education afford: I &s;pared neither my per&s;on nor my pur&s;e, to gratify her vanity and pride; my rivals were intimidated, and indeed out&s;hone; and, after all, I began to fear that the dear creature had not a heart to lo&s;e.&mdash;At la&s;t, finding my&s;elf unable to &s;upport the expence of this amour much longer, I was determined to bring the matter to a cri&s;is; and one evening, while we were <HI>t&eacute;te a t&eacute;te,</HI> complained of her in|difference, de&s;cribed the tortures of &s;u&s;pence to a love|&s;ick mind, and pre&s;&s;ed her to di&s;clo&s;e her &s;entiments of matrimony and me, with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s, that &s;he could not with all her art &s;hift the &s;ubject; but was obliged to come to an eclairci&s;&s;ement.&mdash;She told me with a care|le&s;s air, that &s;he had no objection to my per&s;on, and if I could &s;atisfy her mother in other particulars, I &s;hould not find her aver&s;e to the match; but &s;he was re&s;olved to do nothing in an affair of &s;uch momentous concern, with|out the advice and con&s;ent of her parent.&mdash;This was not a very agreeable declaration to me, who&s;e aim had been

to win her inclination fir&s;t, and then &s;ecure my conque&s;t by a private marriage, to which I flattered my&s;elf &s;he would expre&s;s no reluctance&mdash;That I might not, howe|ver, de&s;ert my cau&s;e before it was de&s;perate, I waited on her mother, and with great formality demanded the daughter in marriage: the good lady, who was a very notable woman, behaved with great &s;tate and civility; thanked me for the honour I intended her family, and &s;aid, &s;he did not doubt but that I was in all re&s;pects qualifi|ed to make a woman happy; but it concerned her as a pa|rent, anxious about the welfare of her child, to inquire into the particulars of my fortune, and know what &s;ettle|ment I propo&s;ed to make. To this information, which would have utterly di&s;concerted me, if I had not expect|ed it, I replied without he&s;itation, that though my for|tune was very &s;mall, I was a gentleman by birth and edu|cation, would maintain her daughter in the &s;phere of a gentlewoman, and &s;ettle her own dowry on her and her heirs for ever.&mdash;This careful matron did not &s;eem to reli&s;h my propo&s;al, but ob&s;erved with a demure countenance, that there was no nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ettling that upon her child which was her own already: however, if I plea&s;ed, her lawyer &s;hould confer with mine upon the matter; and in the mean time, &s;he de&s;ired I would favour her with the peru&s;al of my rent-roll.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding the vexa|tion I was under, I could &s;carce forbear laughing in her face at the mention of my rent-roll, which was indeed a &s;evere &s;atire upon my preten&s;ions. I frankly owned I had no landed e&s;tate: and told her, that I could not exactly &s;pecify the &s;um I was ma&s;ter of, until I had regu|lated my affairs, which were at pre&s;ent in &s;ome di&s;order; but that I would take an opportunity of &s;atisfying her on that head very &s;oon.</P>
<P>It was not long before I took my leave; and returned to my lodgings in a very melancholy mood, per&s;uaded that I had nothing more to expect from that quarter: I was confirmed in this opinion next day, when I went back with a view of explaining my&s;elf more fully to the old gentlewoman; and was told by the footman that his la|dies were not at home, although I had &s;een Melinda through the blinds at a parlour window, as I went up to the door. Incen&s;ed at this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ffront, I quitted the door,
<PB N="100" REF="027715_0341_0FD5CD96C32D3798">
without &s;aying one word, and as I repa&s;&s;ed the parlour, bowed to Mi&s;s, who &s;till remained in the &s;ame &s;ituation, &s;ecurely &s;creened, as &s;he thought, from my view.</P>
<P>This di&s;appointment gave me more unea&s;ine&s;s on Strap's account than my own; for I was in no danger of dying for love of Melinda; on the contrary, the remembrance of my charming Narci&s;&s;a was a continual check upon my con&s;cience, during the whole cour&s;e of my addre&s;&s;es; and perhaps contributed to the bad &s;ucce&s;s of my &s;cheme, by controuling my raptures, and condemning my de&s;ign.</P>
<P>There was a nece&s;&s;ity for informing my companion of every thing that happened to me, and I performed this piece of duty in an affected pa&s;&s;ion, &s;wearing I would be his pack hor&s;e no longer, and de&s;iring him to take the management of his affairs into his own hands. This fine&s;&s;e had the de&s;ired effect, for in&s;tead of grumbling over my mi&s;carriage, Strap was frightened at the pa&s;&s;ion I feign|ed, and begged me for the love of God to be appea&s;ed; ob&s;erving, that although we had &s;uffered a great lo&s;s, it was not irreparable; and if fortune frowned to-day, &s;he might perhaps &s;mile to-morrow.&mdash;I pretended to acquie&s;ce in his remarks, prai&s;ed his equanimity, and promi&s;ed to improve by misfortune.&mdash;He, on the other hand, pretended to be perfectly well &s;atisfied with my conduct, and con|jured me to follow the dictates of my own reflection; but in &s;pite of all his affectation, I could perceive his inward affliction, and his vi&s;age &s;en&s;ibly increa&s;ed in longitude from that day.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the mean time my attention was wholly engro&s;&s;ed in &s;earch of another mi&s;tre&s;s, and the de&s;ire of being
<PB N="101" REF="027715_0342_0FD5EE3044AA4A48">
re|venged on Melinda, in both which &s;chemes I was very much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Billy Chatter, who was &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary creature among the ladies, that in all private dances he engaged the men. To him therefore I applied, de&s;iring he would introduce me to a partner of &s;ome figure, at the next private a&s;&s;embly, for the &s;ake of a frolic, the inten|tion of which I would afterwards communicate. Billy, who had heard &s;omething of a difference between Melinda and me, immediately &s;moked part of my de&s;ign, and, thinking I only wanted to alarm her jealou&s;y a little, pro|mi&s;ed to gratify my de&s;ire by matching me with a partner worth thirty thou&s;and pounds, whom the ladies of this end of the town had lately taken into their management and protection. Upon farther inquiry, I found this per|&s;on's name was Mi&s;s Biddy Gripewell; that her father, who had been a pawn-broker, died inte&s;tate, by which means all his &s;ub&s;tance de&s;cended to his daughter, who was &s;o little a favourite, that, could the old man have prevailed with his own rapacious di&s;po&s;ition to part with as much money as would have paid the expence of a will, &s;he would not have inherited the &s;ixth part of his fortune; that during his life, &s;o far from being educated in a way &s;uitable to &s;uch great expectations, &s;he was obliged to live like a &s;ervant wench, and do the mo&s;t menial offices in the family. But his funeral was no &s;ooner performed than &s;he a&s;&s;umed the fine lady, and found &s;o many people of both &s;exes to flatter, care&s;s, and in&s;truct her, that, for want of di&s;cretion and experience, &s;he had grown in&s;ufferably vain and arrogant, and pretended to no le&s;s than a duke or earl at lea&s;t for her hu&s;band; that &s;he had the misfortune to be neglected by the Engli&s;h quality, but a certain poor Scotti&s;h lord was then making intere&s;t to be introduced to her acquaintance. In the mean time &s;he was fallen into the hands of a notable lady, who had already di&s;po&s;ed of her to a lieutenant of foot, a di&s;tant relation of her lady|&s;hip, though mi&s;s as yet knew nothing of the affair; and la&s;tly, that, if I propo&s;ed to dance with her, I mu&s;t give him leave to repre&s;ent me as a knight or foreign count at lea&s;t. I was ravi&s;hed at this piece of information, and con&s;ented for one night to per&s;onate a French marquis, that I might the ea&s;ier fulfil my revenge.</P>
<P>Having made the appointment with Chatter, I went to
<PB N="102" REF="027715_0343_0FD5EE315BF0B5C0">
Banter's lodgings, as I had by this time conceived a great opinion of his penetration and knowledge; and, after I had enjoined &s;ecrecy, told him every circum&s;tance of my di&s;grace with Melinda, and imparted the plan I had pro|jected to mortify that proud coquette, de&s;iring his advice in improving, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in executing the &s;cheme. Nothing could be more agreeable to his mi&s;anthropical temper than an account of her behaviour and my re&s;ent|ment: he applauded my re&s;olution, and propo&s;ed that I &s;hould not only provide my&s;elf with a proper partner, but al&s;o procure &s;uch an one for Mi&s;s Goo&s;etrap as would in|fallibly entail upon her the ridicule of all her acquaint|ance: for this purpo&s;e he mentioned his barber, who, he &s;aid, was a great coxcomb lately come from Paris, who&s;e ab&s;urd affectation and grimace would ea&s;ily pa&s;s upon her for the &s;prightly polite&s;&s;e of a gentleman im|proved by travel. I hugged him for this hint, and he a&s;|&s;ured me, it would be no difficult matter to make him be|lieve, that Melinda, having &s;een him by accident, was captivated by his appearance, and longed for his acquaint|ance. He actually engaged him on this pretence, and painted his good fortune in &s;uch colours, that the poor &s;haver was quite be&s;ide him&s;elf with joy. He was imme|diately fitted with a tawdry &s;uit of clothes belonging to Banter, and by him recommended to Chatter as a very pretty fellow ju&s;t returned from his travels. Ma&s;ter Billy, who acted as a gentleman u&s;her to a great many of the fair &s;ex in and about town, undertook at once to be&s;peak Melinda in his behalf; and every thing happened accord|ing to my wi&s;h.</P>
<P>At the time appointed I appeared, dre&s;&s;ed to the be&s;t advantage, and, in the character of a Marquis had the ho|nour of opening the ball with the rich heire&s;s, who attract|ed the eyes of the whole company by the prodigious num|ber of jewels with which &s;he was adorned. Among others, I perceived Melinda, who could no more conceal her envy than a&s;toni&s;hment at my &s;ucce&s;s: her curio&s;ity was &s;till more flagrant and tormenting; for &s;he had never &s;een Mi&s;s Gripewell before; and Chatter, who alone could give her any &s;atisfaction on that head, was engaged in conver&s;ation at the other end of the room. I ob&s;erved her impatience, and exulted in her chagrin; and, after my partner was &s;et,
<PB N="103" REF="027715_0344_0FD5EE32E272A250">
took the opportunity of pa&s;&s;ing by her to make a flight bow without &s;topping, which completed my triumph and her indignation. She changed colour, bridled up, a&s;&s;umed an air of di&s;dain, and flirted her fan with &s;uch fury that it went to pieces in a moment, to the no &s;mall entertainment of tho&s;e who &s;at near and ob&s;erved her.</P>
<P>At length the metamorpho&s;ed barber took her out, and acted his part with &s;uch ridiculous extravagance, that the mirth of the whole company was excited at his expence, and his partner &s;o much a&s;hamed, that, before the country dances began, &s;he retired in great confu&s;ion, under pre|tence of being taken &s;uddenly ill, and was followed by her gallant, who no doubt imagined her indi&s;po&s;ition was no|thing but love, and laid hold of the occa&s;ion of conducting her home to comfort her with an a&s;&s;urance of his enter|taining a reciprocal pa&s;&s;ion. They were no &s;ooner gone than an inqui&s;itive whi&s;per of "Who is he?" ran round the room, and Chatter could give them no other intelligence about him than that he was a man of fortune ju&s;t returned from his travels: I, who alone was acquainted with his real quality, affected ignorance, well knowing, that female curio&s;ity would not re&s;t &s;atisfied with &s;uch a general ac|count, and that the di&s;covery would proceed with a better grace from any body than me.</P>
<P>Mean while I was tempted by the richne&s;s of the prize to practi&s;e upon Mi&s;s Gripewell's heart, but &s;oon found it too well fortified with pride and indifference to yield to any efforts in my own character, and I neither would nor could pre&s;erve the title I had borrowed longer than that night.</P>
<P>As I expected, every thing came to light next day. The barber, in pure &s;implicity of heart, detected him&s;elf to Melinda, and di&s;covered the foundation of his hopes; &s;he &s;ickened at the affront, and was a&s;hamed to &s;hew her face in public for many weeks after this accident. Poor Chat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er found it impo&s;&s;ible to ju&s;tify him&s;elf to her &s;atis|faction, was in utter di&s;grace with Mi&s;s Gripewell for having impo&s;ed me upon her as a nobleman, and &s;uffered very much in his character and influence among the ladies in general.</P>
<P>Finding my finances dimini&s;hed more than one half, and my project as little advanced as on the fir&s;t day of my ar|rival
<PB N="104" REF="027715_0345_0FD5EE348AE5EEA8">
in town, I began to de&s;pair of any &s;ucce&s;s, and grew melancholy at the pro&s;pect of approaching want. To di&s;|pel the horrors of this fiend, I had recour&s;e to the bottle, and kept more company than ever, I became particularly attached to the play-hou&s;e, conver&s;ed with the actors be|hind the &s;cenes, grew acquainted with a body of templars, and in a &s;hort time commenced a profe&s;&s;ed wit and critic. Indeed I may &s;ay without vanity, that I was much better qualified than any one of my companions, who were, ge|nerally &s;peaking, of all the creatures I ever conver&s;ed with, the mo&s;t ignorant and a&s;&s;uming. By means of the&s;e avo|cations I got the better of care, and learned to &s;eparate my ideas in &s;uch a manner, that, whenever I was attacked by a gloomy reflection, I could &s;hove it a&s;ide, and call in &s;ome agreeable reverie to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This was not the ca&s;e with Strap, who practi&s;ed a thou&s;and &s;hifts to conceal the &s;orrow that preyed upon his carca&s;e, and reduced him to the re&s;emblance of a mere &s;keleton.</P>
<P>While I thus po&s;ted in a thoughtle&s;s manner towards po|verty, I one day received by the penny po&s;t a letter writ|ten in a woman's hand, containing a great many high|flown compliments, warm prote&s;tations of love, couched in a very poetical &s;tile, an earne&s;t de&s;ire of knowing whether or not my heart was engaged, by leaving an an&s;wer at a certain place, directed to R. B. and the whole &s;ub&s;cribed "Your <HI>Incognita.</HI>" I was tran&s;ported with joy on read|ing the contents of this billet-doux, which I admired as a ma&s;terpiece of tenderne&s;s and elegance, and was already up to the ears in love with the author, whom my imagi|nation repre&s;ented as a lady of fortune, in the bloom of youth and beauty. Elevated with this conjecture, I went to work, and exhau&s;ted my invention in compo&s;ing an an|&s;wer &s;uitable to the &s;ublimity of her &s;tile, and the ardour of her &s;entiments, I expre&s;&s;ed my admiration of her wit in terms the mo&s;t hyperbolical, and while I acknowledged my&s;elf unworthy of her regard, declared my&s;elf enamoured of her under&s;tanding, and in the mo&s;t pathetic manner implored the honour of an interview. Having fini&s;hed this performance, and communicated it to Strap, who &s;kipped about for joy, I di&s;patched him with it to the place ap|pointed, which was the hou&s;e of a milliner not far from Bond-&s;treet, and de&s;ired him to keep watch near the door
<PB N="105" REF="027715_0346_0FD5EE36BB76FA08">
for &s;ome time, that he might di&s;cover the per&s;on who &s;hould call for it. In le&s;s than an hour he returned with a joyful countenance, and told me that, &s;oon after he bad delivered the letter, a chairman was called, to whom it was given, with directions to carry it to the hou&s;e of a rich gentleman in the neighbourhood, whither he (Strap) followed him and &s;aw it put into the hands of a waiting|woman, who paid the me&s;&s;enger and &s;hut the door&mdash;that upon inquiry at an ale-hou&s;e hard by, where he called for a pint of beer, he under&s;tood that the gentleman, to whom the hou&s;e belonged, had an only daughter, very hand|&s;ome, who would inherit his whole e&s;tate, and who cer|tainly was the author of the billet I had received. I was of the &s;ame opinion, and, hugging my&s;elf in the happy pro&s;pect, dre&s;&s;ed immediately, and pa&s;&s;ed in great &s;tate by the hou&s;e that contained my unknown admirer&mdash;nor was my vanity di&s;appointed; for I perceived a beautiful young creature &s;tanding at one of the windows of the dining|room, who, I imagined, ob&s;erved me with more than common curio&s;ity. That I might indulge her view, and at the &s;ame time fea&s;t my own, I affected to &s;top, and give orders to Strap in the &s;treet, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to her &s;tation, by which means I had an opportunity of &s;eeing her more di&s;tinctly, and of congratulating my&s;elf on having made a conque&s;t of &s;o much perfection. In a few minutes &s;he retired, and I betook my&s;elf to the ordinary in a rapture of hope, which deprived me of my appetite for that meal, and &s;ent me home in the evening to indulge my contem|plation.</P>
<P>Early next day I was favoured with another epi&s;tle from my unknown charmer, &s;ignifying her unutterable joy at the receipt of mine, which, while it made a tender of my heart, convinced her of the value of it; above all things, &s;he profe&s;&s;ed extreme plea&s;ure in finding me &s;o much at|tached to her under&s;tanding, a circum&s;tance that not only flattered her in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part, but at the &s;ame time argued my own &s;agacity. As for the interview I de&s;ired, &s;he a&s;&s;ured me, that I could not be more eager for &s;uch an occa&s;ion than &s;he; but &s;he mu&s;t not only &s;acrifice a little more to decorum, but be &s;atisfied of my honourable in|tentions, before &s;he could grant that reque&s;t: mean while &s;he gave me to under&s;tand, that, although &s;he might owe
<PB N="106" REF="027715_0347_0FD5EE3B79CB8458">
&s;ome deference to the opinion of certain per&s;ons, &s;he was re&s;olved, in an affair that &s;o nearly concerned her happi|ne&s;s, to con&s;ult her own inclination preferable to the ad|vice of the whole world, e&s;pecially as &s;he was urged to &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ion by no con&s;ideration of fortune, what &s;he depended upon being her own without re&s;triction or control. Struck with admiration at the philo&s;ophy and &s;elf-denial of my mi&s;tre&s;s, who &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible of the beauty &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and in particular ravi&s;hed with that piece of intelligence by which I learned her fortune was independent, I re&s;umed the pen, launched out into enco|miums on the dignity of her &s;entiments, affected to un|dervalue the charms of external beauty, pretended to ground my pa&s;&s;ion on the qualities of her mind, complain|ed of her rigour in &s;acrificing my repo&s;e to an over-&s;cru|pulous regard to decorum, and declared the purity of my de&s;igns in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and pathetic vows. This per|formance, being &s;ealed and directed, was &s;ent to the place appointed by Strap, who, that we might be &s;till the more confirmed in our belief, renewed his watch, and in a little time brought back the &s;ame information as before, with this addition, that Mi&s;s Sparkle, (the name of my &s;up|po&s;ed corre&s;pondent,) looking out at the window, no &s;oon|er &s;aw the me&s;&s;enger arrive than &s;he &s;hut the ca&s;ement in a &s;ort of beautiful confu&s;ion, and di&s;appeared; eager, no doubt, to hear from the dear object of her love.</P>
<P>My doubts now vani&s;hed, the long-expected port ap|peared, and I looked upon my&s;elf as perfectly &s;ecure of that happine&s;s I had been in que&s;t of &s;o long. After din|ner I &s;auntered in company with Dr. Wagtail to that part of the town in which my inamorata lived, and, as he was a mere regi&s;ter, inquired of him into the name, character, and fortune of every body who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a good hou&s;e in the &s;treets through which we pa&s;&s;ed. When it came to his turn to mention Sir John Sparkle, he repre&s;ented him as a man of an immen&s;e e&s;tate, and narrow di&s;po&s;ition, who mewed up his only child, a fine young lady, from the con|ver&s;ation of mankind, under the &s;trict watch and in&s;pection of an old governante, who was either &s;o hone&s;t, envious, or infatiable, that nobody had been as yet able to make her a friend, or get acce&s;s to her charge, though numbers attempted it every day&mdash;not &s;o much on account of her
<PB N="107" REF="027715_0348_0FD5EE3CDB5D3408">
expectations from her father, who, being a widower, might marry again, and have &s;ons, as for a fortune of twelve thou&s;and pounds left her by an uncle, of which &s;he could not be deprived. This piece of news, exactly tallying with the la&s;t part of the letter I had been honour|ed with in the morning, had &s;uch an effect on me, that any man except Wagtail might have ob&s;erved my emotion; but his attention was too much engro&s;&s;ed by the contem|plation of his own importance, to be affected with the de|portment of any other body, unle&s;s it happened to be &s;o particular that he could not help taking notice of it.</P>
<P>When I had di&s;engaged my&s;elf from him, who&s;e con|ver&s;ation grew in&s;ipid to me, I went home, and made Strap acquainted with the fruits of my re&s;earches. This faithful &s;quire was almo&s;t ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aked with tran&s;port, and even wept with joy, but whether on account of him&s;elf or me, I &s;hall not pretend to determine. Next day a third billet-doux was brought to me, containing many expre&s;|&s;ions of tenderne&s;s, mingled with &s;ome affecting doubts about the artifice of man, the incon&s;tancy of youth, and the jealou&s;y often attending the mo&s;t &s;incere pa&s;&s;ion, withal de&s;iring I would excu&s;e her, if &s;he &s;hould try me a little longer, before &s;he declared her&s;elf beyond the power of retracting. The&s;e intere&s;ting &s;cruples added fuel to my flame, and impatience to my hope; I redoubled my com|plaints of her indifference, and pre&s;&s;ed her to an a&s;&s;ignation with &s;uch fervid entreaties, that in a few days &s;he con&s;ent|ed to meet me at the hou&s;e of that milliner, who had forwarded all my letters. During the interval between the date of her promi&s;e and the hour of appointment, my pride &s;oared beyond all rea&s;on and de&s;cription; I lo&s;t all remem|brance of the gentle Narci&s;&s;a, and my thoughts were wholly employed in planning triumphs over the malice and contempt of the world.</P>
<P>At length the happy hour arrived; I flew to the place of rendezvous, and was conducted into an apartment, where I had not waited ten minutes when I heard the ru&s;t|ling of &s;ilk, and the &s;ound of feet a&s;cending the &s;tairs: my heart took the alarm, and beat quick, my cheeks glowed, my nerves thrilled, and my knees &s;hook with exta&s;y! I perceived the door opening, &s;aw a gold brocade petticoat advance, and &s;prang forward to embrace my charmer.&mdash;
<PB N="108" REF="027715_0349_0FD5EE3E2F7356C0">
Heaven and earth! how &s;hall I paint my &s;ituation, when I found Mi&s;s Sparkle converted into a wrinkled hag turned of &s;eventy! I was &s;truck dumb with amazement, and pe|trified with horror! This ancient Urganda perceived my di&s;order, and, approaching with a langui&s;hing air, &s;eized my hand, a&s;king in a &s;queaking tone if I was indi&s;po&s;ed? Her mon&s;trous affectation completed the di&s;gu&s;t I had conceived for her at fir&s;t appearance, and it was a long time before I could command my&s;elf &s;o much as to behave with common civility: at length, however, I recollected my&s;elf, and pronounced an apology for my behaviour, which, I &s;aid, proceeded from a dizzine&s;s that &s;eized me all of a &s;udden. My hoary Dulcinea, who, no doubt, had been alarmed at my confu&s;ion, no &s;ooner learned the cau&s;e, to which I now a&s;cribed it, than &s;he di&s;covered her joy in a thou&s;and amorous coquetries, and a&s;&s;umed the &s;prightly airs of a girl of &s;ixteen. One while &s;he ogled me with her dim eyes quenched in rheum; then, as if &s;he was a&s;hamed of that freedom, &s;he affected to look down, blu&s;h, and play with her &s;an, then to&s;s her head, that I might not perceive a pal&s;y that &s;hook it, a&s;k &s;ome childi&s;h que&s;tions with a li&s;ping accent, giggle and grin with her mouth &s;hut, to conceal the ravages of time upon her teeth, leer upon me again, &s;igh piteou&s;ly, fling her&s;elf about in her chair to &s;hew her agility, and act a great many more ab&s;ur|dities that youth and beauty can alone excu&s;e. Shocked as I was at my di&s;appointment, my di&s;po&s;ition was incapable of affronting any per&s;on who loved me; I therefore endea|voured to put a good face on the matter for the pre&s;ent, re&s;olving to drop the whole affair as &s;oon as I &s;hould get clear of her company; with this view I uttered &s;ome civil things, and in particular de&s;ired to know the name and condition of the lady who had honoured me &s;o much. She told me her name was Withers; that &s;he lived with Sir John Sparkle in quality of governe&s;s to his only daugh|ter, in which &s;ituation &s;he had picked up a comfortable &s;ufficiency to make her ea&s;y for life; that &s;he had the plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing me at church, where my appearance and deportment made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon her heart, that &s;he could enjoy no ea&s;e until &s;he had enquired into my character, which &s;he found &s;o amiable in all re&s;pects, that &s;he yielded to the violence of her inclination, and ventured
<PB N="109" REF="027715_0350_0FD5EE400396A7C8">
to declare her pa&s;&s;ion, with too little regard perhaps to the decorum of her &s;ex; but &s;he hoped I would forgive a tre&s;pa&s;s, of which I my&s;elf was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the cau&s;e, and impute her intru&s;ion to the irre&s;i&s;tible dictates of love. No decayed rake ever-&s;wallowed a bolus with more reluctance than I felt in making a reply &s;uitable to this compliment, when, in&s;tead of the jewel, I found the crazy ca&s;ket only in my power; and yet my hopes began to revive a little, when I con&s;idered, that, by carrying on the appearance of an intrigue with the duenna, I might po&s;&s;ibly obtain acce&s;s to her charge. Encouraged by this &s;ugge&s;tion, my temper grew more &s;erene; my re&s;erve wore off: I talked <HI>en cavalier,</HI> and even made love to this an|tiquated coquette, who &s;eemed extremely happy in her adorer, and &s;pread all her allurements to make her ima|gined conque&s;t more &s;ecure. The good woman of the hou&s;e treated us with tea and &s;weatmeats, and afterwards withdrew, like a civil experienced matron as &s;he was. Left thus to our mutual endearments, Mi&s;s Withers (for &s;he was &s;till a maiden) began to talk of matrimony, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;o much impatience in all her behaviour, that, had &s;he been fifty years younger, I might po&s;&s;ibly have grati|fied her longing without having recour&s;e to the church; but this my virtue as well as intere&s;t forbade. When the inclinations of an old maid &s;ettle upon a young fellow, he is per&s;ecuted with her addre&s;&s;es; but, &s;hould he once grant her the favour, he will never be able to di&s;entangle him&s;elf from her importunities and reproaches. It was my bu&s;i|ne&s;s to defer the ceremony as long as po&s;&s;ible, under the mo&s;t &s;pecious pretences, with a view of becoming acquaint|ed with Mi&s;s Sparkle in the mean time; and I did not de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s when I con&s;idered, that in the cour&s;e of our corre&s;pondence I &s;hould, in all probability, be invited to vi&s;it my mi&s;tre&s;s in her own apartment, and by that means have an opportunity of conver&s;ing with her charm|ing ward. Plea&s;ed with this pro&s;pect, my heart dilated with joy, I talked in raptures to the &s;tale governante, and ki&s;&s;ed her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hand with great devotion. She was &s;o much tran&s;ported with her good fortune that &s;he could not contain her exta&s;y, but flew upon me like a tigre&s;s, and pre&s;&s;ed her &s;kinny lips to mine, when (as it was no doubt concerted by her evil genius) a do&s;e of garlic &s;he

<ARGUMENT>
<P>I cultivate an acquaintance with two noblemen&mdash;am intro|duced to Earl Strutwell&mdash;his kind promi&s;e and invita|tion&mdash;the behaviour of his porter and lackey&mdash;he receives me with an appearance of uncommon affection&mdash;undertakes to &s;peak in my behalf to the mini&s;ter&mdash;informs me of his &s;ucce&s;s, and wi&s;hes me joy&mdash;introduces a conver&s;ation about Petronius Arbiter&mdash;falls in love with my watch, which I pre&s;s upon him&mdash;I make a pre&s;ent of a diamond ring to Lord Straddle&mdash;impart my good fortune to Strap, and Banter who di&s;abu&s;es me, to my utter mortification.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BAFFLED hitherto in my matrimonial &s;chemes, I began to que&s;tion my talents for the &s;cience of for|tune-bunting, and to bend my thoughts towards &s;ome em|ployment under the government.&mdash;With the view of pro|curing which, I cultivated the acquaintance of Lords Straddle and Swillpot, who&s;e fathers were men of intere&s;t at court.&mdash;I found the&s;e young noblemen as open to my advances as I could de&s;ire: I accompanied them in their midnight rambles, and often dined with them at taverns, where I had the honour of paying the reckoning.</P>
<P>I one day took the opportunity, while I was loaded with prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip, to di&s;clo&s;e my de&s;ire of being &s;ettled in &s;ome &s;inecure, and to &s;olicit their influ|ence in my behalf.&mdash;Swillpot &s;queezing my hand, &s;aid, I might depend upon his &s;ervice, by G&mdash;d. The other &s;wore that no man would be more proud than he to run my errands. Encouraged by the&s;e declarations, I ven|tured to expre&s;s an inclination to be introduced to their fathers, who were able to do my bu&s;ine&s;s at once. Swill|pot frankly owned he had not &s;poke to his father the&s;e three years; and Straddle a&s;&s;ured me his father having lately di&s;obliged the mini&s;ter by &s;ub&s;cribing his name to a prote&s;t in the Hou&s;e of Peers, was thereby rendered inca|pable of &s;erving his friends at pre&s;ent; but he undertook to make me acquainted with Earl Strutwell, who was hand and glove with a certain per&s;on who ruled the roa&s;t. This offer I embraced with many acknowledgments, and plied him &s;o clo&s;ely, in &s;pite of a thou&s;and eva&s;ions, that
<PB N="112" REF="027715_0353_0FD5EE47AA4C6E20">
he found him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of keeping his word, and actually carried me to the levee of this great man, where he left me in a crowd of fellow-dependants, and was u&s;hered to a particular clo&s;et audience; from whence in a few minutes he returned with his Lord&s;hip, who took me by the hand, a&s;&s;ured me he would do me all the &s;ervice he could, and de&s;ired to &s;ee me often.&mdash;I was charmed with my reception, and although I had heard that a courtier's promi&s;e was not to be depended upon, I thought I di&s;covered &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s of temper in this Earl's countenance, that I did not doubt of profiting by his protection. I re&s;olved, therefore, to avail my&s;elf of his permi&s;&s;ion, and waited on him next audience-day, when I was favoured with a particular &s;mile, &s;queeze of the hand, and a whi&s;per, &s;ignifying that he wanted half an hour's conver&s;ation with me <HI>t&eacute;te a t&eacute;te,</HI> when he &s;hould be di&s;engaged, and for that purpo&s;e de&s;ired me to come and drink a di&s;h of chocolate with him to-morrow morn|ing.&mdash;This invitation, which did not a little flatter my vanity and expectation, I took care to ob&s;erve, and went to his Lord&s;hip's hou&s;e at the time appointed. Having rapped at the gate, the porter unbolted and kept it half open, placing him&s;elf in the gap, like &s;oldiers in a breach, to di&s;pute my pa&s;&s;age. I a&s;ked if his lord was &s;tir|ring?&mdash;He an&s;wered with a &s;urly a&s;pect, "No."&mdash;"At what hour does he commonly ri&s;e?" (&s;aid I.)&mdash;"Sometimes &s;ooner, &s;ometimes later," (&s;aid he, clo&s;ing the door upon me by degrees.)&mdash;I then told him I was come by his Lord&s;hip's own appointment; to which this Cerberus replied, <Q>I have received no orders about the matter;</Q> and was upon the point of &s;hutting me out, when I recollected my&s;elf all of a &s;udden, and &s;lipping a crown into his hand, begged as a favour that he would enquire and let me know whether or not the Earl was up. The grim janitor relented at the touch of my money, which he took with all the indifference of a tax-gatherer, and &s;hewed me into a parlour, where, he &s;aid, I might amu&s;e my&s;elf till &s;uch time as his Lord&s;hip &s;hould be awake.&mdash;I had not &s;at ten minutes in this place, when a foot|man entered, and without &s;peaking, &s;tared at me. I in|terpreted this piece of his behaviour into <Q>Pray, Sir, what is your bu&s;ine&s;s?</Q> and a&s;ked the &s;ame que&s;tion I
<PB N="113" REF="027715_0354_0FD5CD93E88BAB50">
had put to the porter, when I acco&s;ted him fir&s;t. The lackey made the &s;ame reply, and di&s;appeared before I could get any further intelligence.&mdash;In a little while he re|turned on pretence of poking the fire, and looked at me again with great earne&s;tne&s;s; upon which I began to per|ceive his meaning, and tipping him with half a crown, de&s;ired he would be &s;o good as to fall upon &s;ome method of letting the Earl know that I was in the hou&s;e.&mdash;He made a low bow, and &s;aid, "Yes, Sir," and vani&s;hed.&mdash;This bounty was not thrown away, for in an in&s;tant he came back, and conducted me to a chamber, where I was received with great kindne&s;s and familiarity by his Lord|&s;hip, whom I found ju&s;t ri&s;en, in his morning gown and &s;lippers.&mdash;After breakfa&s;t, he entered into a particular conver&s;ation with me about my travels, the remarks I had made abroad, and examined me to the full extent of my under&s;tanding.&mdash;My an&s;wers &s;eemed to plea&s;e him very much, he frequently &s;queezed my hand, and look|ing at me with a &s;ingular complacency in his countenance, bid me depend upon his good offices with the mini&s;try in my behalf. "Young men of your qualifications," &s;aid he, <Q>ought to be cheri&s;hed by every admini&s;tration.&mdash;For my own part, I &s;ee &s;o little merit in the world, that I have laid it down as a maxim, to encourage the lea&s;t appearance of genius and virtue, to the utmo&s;t of my power.&mdash;You have a great deal of both; and will not fail of making a figure one day, if I am not mi&s;ta|ken; but you mu&s;t lay your account with mounting by gradual &s;teps to the &s;ummit of your fortune.&mdash;<HI>Rome was not built in a day.</HI> As you under&s;tand the lan|guages perfectly well, how would you like to cro&s;s the &s;ea, as &s;ecretary to an emba&s;&s;y?</Q>&mdash;I a&s;&s;ured his Lord|&s;hip with great eagerne&s;s, that nothing could be more agreeable to my inclination: upon which he bid me make my&s;elf ea&s;y, my bu&s;ine&s;s was done, for he had a place of that kind in his view.&mdash;This piece of genero&s;ity affected me &s;o much, that I was unable for &s;ome time to expre&s;s my gratitude, which at length broke out in acknowledg|ments of my own unworthine&s;s, and encomiums on his be|nevolence.&mdash;I could not even help &s;hedding tears at the goodne&s;s of this noble Lord, who no &s;ooner perceived them, than he caught me in his arms, hugged and ki&s;&s;ed
<PB N="114" REF="027715_0355_0FD5EE4AEA933738">
me with a &s;eemingly paternal affection.&mdash;Confounded at this uncommon in&s;tance of fondne&s;s for a &s;tranger, I re|mained a few moments &s;ilent and a&s;hamed, then ro&s;e and took my leave, after he had a&s;&s;ured me that he would &s;peak to the mini&s;ter in my favour that very day, and de|&s;ired that I would not for the future give my&s;elf the trou|ble of attending at his levee, but come at the &s;ame hour every day when he &s;hould be at lei&s;ure, which was three times a-week.</P>
<P>Though my hopes were now very &s;anguine, I determined to conceal my pro&s;pect from every body, even from Strap, until I &s;hould be more certain of &s;ucce&s;s, and in the mean time give my patron no re&s;pite from my &s;olicitations. When I renewed my vi&s;it, I found the &s;treet-door opened to me as if by enchantment; but, in my pa&s;&s;age towards the pre&s;ence-room, I was met by the valet de chambre, who ca&s;t &s;ome furious looks at me, the meaning of which I could not comprehend. The Earl &s;aluted me at entrance with a tender embrace, and wi&s;hed me joy of his &s;ucce&s;s with the premier, who, he &s;aid, had preferred his recom|mendation to that of two other noblemen very urgent in behalf of their re&s;pective friends, and ab&s;olutely promi&s;ed that I &s;hould go to a certain foreign court in quality of &s;ecretary to an amba&s;&s;ador and plenipotentiary, who was to &s;et out in a few weeks on an affair of va&s;t importance to the nation. I was thunder&s;truck with my good for|tune, and could make no other reply, than kneel and at|tempt to ki&s;s my benefactor's hand, which he would not permit, but rai&s;ing me up, pre&s;&s;ed me to his brea&s;t with &s;urpri&s;ing emotion, and told me he had now taken upon him&s;elf the care of making my fortune.&mdash;What enhanced the value of the benefit &s;till the more, was his making light of the favour, and &s;hifting the conver&s;ation to ano|ther &s;ubject: among other topics of di&s;cour&s;e, that of the <HI>Belle Lettres</HI> was introduced, upon which his Lord&s;hip held forth with great ta&s;te and erudition, and di&s;covered an intimate knowledge of the authors of antiquity.&mdash;<Q>Here's a book,</Q> &s;aid he, taking one from his bo&s;om, <Q>writ|ten with great elegance and &s;pirit, and though the &s;ub|ject may giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> offence to &s;ome narrow-minded people, the author will always be held in e&s;teem by every per|&s;on of wit and learning.</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying he put into my
<PB N="115" REF="027715_0356_0FD5EE4CC925C818">
hand Petronius Arbiter, and a&s;ked my opinion of his wit and manner.&mdash;I told him, that, in my opinion, he wrote with great ea&s;e and vivacity, but was withal &s;o lewd and indecent, that he ought to find no quarter or protection among people of morals and ta&s;te.&mdash;"I own," replied the Earl, <Q>that his ta&s;te in love is generally decried, and in|deed condemned by our laws; but perhaps that may be more owing to prejudice and mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, than to true rea&s;on and deliberation.&mdash;The be&s;t man among the ancients is &s;aid to have entertained that pa&s;&s;ion; one of the wi&s;e&s;t of their legi&s;lators has permitted the indulgence of it in his commonwealth; the mo&s;t cele|brated poets have not &s;crupled to avow it at this day; it prevails not only over all the Ea&s;t, but in mo&s;t parts of Europe; in our own country it gains ground apace, and in all probability will become in a &s;hort time, a more fa&s;hionable vice than &s;imple fornication.&mdash;Indeed, there is &s;omething to be &s;aid in vindication of it; for notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the law again&s;t offend|ers in this way, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the practice of this pa&s;&s;ion is unattended with that cur&s;e and burden upon &s;ociety, which proceeds from a race of mi&s;erable and de&s;erted ba&s;tards, who are&punc; either murdered by their parents, de&s;erted to the utmo&s;t want and wretchedne&s;s, or bred up to prey upon the commonwealth; and it like|wi&s;e prevents the debauchery of many a young maiden, and the pro&s;titution of hone&s;t mens wives; not to men|tion the con&s;ideration of health, which is much le&s;s liable to be impaired in the gratification of this appe|tite, than in the exerci&s;e of common venery, which by ruining the con&s;titutions of our young men, has produ|ced a puny progeny that degenerates from generation to generation: nay, I have been told, that there is ano|ther motive perhaps more powerful than all the&s;e, that induces people to cultivate this inclination; namely, the exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure attending its &s;ucce&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>From this di&s;cour&s;e, I began to be apprehen&s;ive that his Lord&s;hip finding I had travelled, was afraid I might have been in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ected with this &s;purious and &s;ordid de&s;ire abroad, and took this method of &s;ounding my &s;entiments on the &s;ubject.&mdash;Fired at this &s;uppo&s;ed &s;u&s;picion, I argu|ed again&s;t it with great warmth, as an appetite unnatu|ral,
<PB N="116" REF="027715_0357_0FD5EE501F2914D0">
ab&s;urd, and of pernicious con&s;equence; and declared my utter dete&s;tation and abhorrence of it in the&s;e lines of the &s;atyri&s;t:
<Q><L>Eternal infamy the wretch confound,</L>
<L>Who planted fir&s;t this vice on Briti&s;h ground!</L>
<L>A vice! that, '&s;pite of &s;en&s;e and nature, reigns,</L>
<L>And poi&s;ons genial love, and manhood &s;tains!</L></Q></P>
<P>The Earl &s;miled at my indignation, told me he was glad to find my opinion of the matter &s;o conformable to his own, and that what he had advanced was only to provoke me to an an&s;wer, with which he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf perfectly well plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>After I had enjoyed a long audience, I happened to look at my watch, in order to regulate my motions by it: and his lord&s;hip, ob&s;erving the cha&s;ed ca&s;e, de&s;ired to &s;ee the device, and examine the execution, which he approved with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of admiration. Con&s;idering the ob|ligations I lay under to his lord&s;hip, I thought there could not be a fitter opportunity than the pre&s;ent to manife&s;t in &s;ome &s;hape my gratitude; I therefore begged he would do me the honour to accept of the watch as a &s;mall te&s;ti|mony of the &s;en&s;e I had of his Lord&s;hip's genero&s;ity; but he refu&s;ed it in a peremptory manner, and &s;aid he was &s;orry I &s;hould entertain &s;uch a mercenary opinion of him, ob&s;erving at the &s;ame time, that it was the mo&s;t beautiful piece of workman&s;hip he had ever &s;een, and de&s;iring to know where he could have &s;uch another. I begged a thou&s;and pardons for the freedom I had taken, which I hoped he would impute to nothing el&s;e than the highe&s;t veneration for his per&s;on&mdash;told him that, as it came to my hand by accident in France, I could give him no information about the maker; for there was no name on the in&s;ide; and once more humbly entreated, that he would indulge me &s;o far as to u&s;e it for my &s;ake. He was &s;till po&s;itive in refu&s;ing it, but was plea&s;ed to thank me for my generous offer, &s;aying, it was a pre&s;ent that no noble|man need be a&s;hamed of receiving, though he was re&s;olved to &s;hew his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s with regard to me, for whom he had conceived a particular friend&s;hip, and in&s;i&s;ted (if I was willing to part with the watch) upon knowing what it co&s;t, that he might at lea&s;t indemnify me by refunding
<PB N="117" REF="027715_0358_0FD5EE50234D8578">
the money. On the other hand I a&s;&s;ured his lord&s;hip, that I &s;hould look upon it as an uncommon mark of di&s;tinction, if he would take it without farther que&s;tion; and, rather than di&s;oblige me, he was at la&s;t per&s;uaded to put it in his pocket, to my no &s;mall &s;atisfaction, who took my leave immediately, after having received a kind &s;queeze, and an injunction to depend on his promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Buoyed up with this reception, my heart opened; I gave away a guinea among the lacqueys who e&s;corted me to the door, flew to the lodgings of Lord Straddle upon whom I forced my diamond ring as an acknowledgment for the great &s;ervice he had done me, and from thence hied my&s;elf home, with an intent of &s;haring my happine&s;s with hone&s;t Strap. I determined, however, to heighten his plea&s;ure by depre&s;&s;ing his &s;pirits at fir&s;t, and then bringing in the good news with double reli&s;h. For this purpo&s;e I affected the appearance of di&s;appointment and chagrin, and told him in an abrupt manner, that I had lo&s;t the watch and diamond. Poor Hugh, who had been already harra&s;&s;ed into a con&s;umption by intelligence of this &s;ort, no &s;ooner heard the&s;e words than, unable to contain him&s;elf, he cried with di&s;traction in his looks, <Q>God in heaven forbid!</Q>&mdash;I could carry on the farce no longer, but, laughing in his face, told him every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed as before recited. His features were immediately un|bended, and the tran&s;ition &s;o affecting, that he wept with joy, calling my Lord Strutwell by the appellations of jewel, phoenix, <HI>rara avis,</HI> and prai&s;ing God, that there was &s;till &s;ome virtue among our nobility. Our mutual con|gratulations being over, we gave way to our imagination, and anticipated our happine&s;s by pro&s;ecuting our &s;ucce&s;s through the different &s;teps of promotion, till I arrived at the rank of prime mini&s;ter, and he to that of my fir&s;t &s;ecretary.</P>
<P>Intoxicated with the&s;e ideas, I went to the ordinary, where, meeting with Banter, I communicated the whole affair in confidence to him, concluding with an a&s;&s;urance, that I would do him all the &s;ervice in my power. He heard me to an end with great patience, then, regarding me a good while with a look of di&s;dain, pronounced, "So, your bu&s;ine&s;s is done, you think!"&mdash;<Q>As good as done, I believe,</Q> &s;aid I.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I WAS &s;o confounded that I could make no reply to Ban|ter, who reproached me with great indignation for having thrown away upon ra&s;cals that, which, had it been converted into ready money, would have &s;upported the rank of a gentleman for &s;ome months, and enabled me at the &s;ame time to oblige my friends. Stupified as I was, I could ea&s;ily divine the &s;ource of his concern, but &s;neaked away in a &s;olitary manner, without yielding the lea&s;t an|&s;wer to his expo&s;tulations, and began to deliberate with my&s;elf in what manner I &s;hould attempt to retrieve the moveables I had &s;o fooli&s;hly lo&s;t. I &s;hould have thought it no robbery to take them again by force, could I have done it without any danger of being detected; but, as I could have no &s;uch opportunity, I re&s;olved to work by <HI>fine&s;&s;e,</HI> and go immediately to the lodgings of Straddle, where I was &s;o fortunate as to find him.&mdash;"My Lord," &s;aid I, <Q>I have ju&s;t now recollected, that the diamond I had the honour of pre&s;enting to you is loo&s;ened in the &s;ocket, and there is a young fellow ju&s;t arrived from Paris, who is reckoned the be&s;t jeweller in Europe; I knew him in France; and, if your Lord&s;hip will give me leave, I will carry the ring to him to be &s;et to rights.</Q> His lord&s;hip was not to be caught in the &s;nare&mdash;he thanked me for my offer, and told me, that, having him&s;elf ob&s;erved the defect, he had already &s;ent it to his own jeweller to be mended: and indeed, by
<PB N="120" REF="027715_0361_0FD5EE555A79E4A0">
this time, I believe it was in the jeweller's hands, though not in order to be mended; for it &s;tood in need of no al|teration.</P>
<P>Baulked in this piece of politics, I cur&s;ed my &s;implicity, but re&s;olved to play a &s;urer game with the earl, which I thus devi&s;ed. I did not doubt of being admitted into fa|miliar conver&s;ation with him as before, and hoped by &s;ome means to get the watch into my hand, then, on pretence of winding or playing with it, drop it on the floor, which in all probability would di&s;order the work &s;o as to &s;top its motion. This event would furni&s;h me with an opportunity of in&s;i&s;ting upon carrying it away in order to be repaired; and had this happened, I &s;hould have been in no hurry to bring it back. What pity it was I could not find an oc|ca&s;ion of putting this fine &s;cheme in execution! When I went to renew my vi&s;it to his lord&s;hip, my acce&s;s to the parlour was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> free as ever; but, after I had waited &s;ome time, the valet de chambre came in with his lord's com|pliments, and a de&s;ire to &s;ee me to-morrow at his levee, being at pre&s;ent &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed that he could not &s;ee company. I interpreted his me&s;&s;age into a bad omen, and came away, muttering cur&s;es again&s;t his lord&s;hip's polite|ne&s;s, and ready to go to loggerheads with my&s;elf for being &s;o egregriou&s;ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. But, that I might have &s;ome &s;atis|faction for the lo&s;s I had &s;u&s;tained, I be&s;ieged him clo&s;ely at his levee, and per&s;ecuted him with my &s;olicitations, not without faint hopes, indeed, of reaping &s;omething more from my indu&s;try than the bare plea&s;ure of making him unea&s;y, though I could never obtain another private hearing during the whole cour&s;e of my attendance; nei|ther had I re&s;olution enough to undeceive Strap, who&s;e looks in a little time were &s;o whetted with impatience, that whenever I came home, his eyes devoured me, as it were, with eagerne&s;s of attention.</P>
<P>At length, however, finding my&s;elf reduced to my la&s;t guinea, I was compelled to di&s;clo&s;e my nece&s;&s;ity, though I endeavoured to &s;weeten the di&s;covery by rehear&s;ing to him the daily a&s;&s;urances I received from my patron. But the&s;e promi&s;es were not of efficacy &s;ufficient to &s;upport the &s;pirits of my friend, who no &s;ooner under&s;tood the lowne&s;s of my finances than, uttering a dreadful groan, he ex|claimed, "In the name of God, what &s;hall we do?" In
<PB N="121" REF="027715_0362_0FD5EE5767ADEDB0">
order to comfort him, I &s;aid that many of my acquaint|ance, who were in a wor&s;e condition than we, &s;upported, notwith&s;tanding, the character and appearance of gentle|men, and advi&s;ing him to thank God, that we had as yet incurred no debt, propo&s;ed he &s;hould pawn my &s;word of &s;teel inlaid with gold, and tru&s;t to my di&s;cretion for the re&s;t. This expedient was wormwood and gall to poor Strap, who, in &s;pite of his invincible affection for me, &s;till retained notions of economy and expence &s;uitable to the narrowne&s;s of his education; neverthele&s;s, he complied with my reque&s;t, and rai&s;ed &s;even pieces on the &s;word in a twinkling. This &s;upply, incon&s;iderable as it was, made me as happy for the pre&s;ent as if I had five hundred pounds in bank; for by this time I was &s;o well &s;killed in procra&s;tinating every trouble&s;ome reflection, that the pro|&s;pect of want &s;eldom affected me very much, let it be ever &s;o near: and now, indeed, it was nearer than I imagined; for my landlord, having occa&s;ion for money, put me in mind of my being indebted to him five guineas in lodging, and, telling me that he had a &s;um to make up, begged I would excu&s;e his importunity, and di&s;charge the debt. Though I could ill &s;pare &s;o much ca&s;h, my pride took the re&s;olution of di&s;bur&s;ing it, which I did in a cavalier man|ner, after he had written a di&s;charge, telling him with an air of &s;corn and re&s;entment, I &s;aw he was re&s;olved that I &s;hould not be long in his books, while Strap, who &s;tood by, and knew my circum&s;tances, wrung his hands in &s;e|cret, gnawed his nether lip, and turned yellow with de|&s;pair. Whatever appearance of indifference my vanity enabled me to put on, I was thunder&s;truck with this de|mand, which I had no &s;ooner &s;atisfied than I ha&s;tened into company, with a view of beguiling my cares with conver|&s;ation, or drowning them in wine.</P>
<P>After dinner accordingly a party was made in the cof|fee-hou&s;e, from whence we adjourned to the tavern, where in&s;tead of &s;haring the mirth of the company, I was as much chagrined at their good humour as a damned &s;oul in hell would be at a glimp&s;e of heaven.&mdash;In vain did I &s;wallow bumper after bumper! the wine had lo&s;t its effect upon me, and &s;o far from rai&s;ing my dejected &s;pirits, could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ven lay me a&s;leep.&mdash;Banter who was the only inti|mate I had, (Strap excepted,) perceived my anxiety, and
<PB N="122" REF="027715_0363_0FD5EE586131E8D8">
when we broke up, reproached me with pu&s;illanimity, for being ca&s;t down at any di&s;appointment that &s;uch a ra&s;cal as Strutwell could be the occa&s;ion of.&mdash;I told him I did not at all &s;ee how Strutwell's being a ra&s;cal alleviated my misfortune: and gave him to under&s;tand, that my pre&s;ent grief did not &s;o much proceed from that di&s;appointment, as from the low ebb of my fortune, which was &s;unk to &s;omething le&s;s than two guineas.&mdash;At this declaration he cried, "P&s;haw! is that all?" and a&s;&s;ured me there were a thou&s;and ways of living in town without fortune, he him&s;elf having &s;ub&s;i&s;ted many years entirely by his wit.&mdash;I expre&s;&s;ed my eager de&s;ire of being acquainted with &s;ome of the&s;e methods, and he, without further expo&s;tulation, bid me follow him.&mdash;He conducted me to a hou&s;e under the piazzas in Covent Garden, which we entered, and having delivered our &s;words to a grim fellow, who de|manded them at the foot of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, a&s;cended to the &s;econd &s;tory, where I &s;aw multitudes of people &s;tanding round two gaming tables, loaded in a manner with gold and &s;ilver.&mdash;My conductor let me know that this was the hou&s;e of a worthy Scotch lord, who u&s;ing the privilege of his peerage, had &s;et up a public gaming table, from the profits of which he drew a comfortable livelihood.&mdash;He then explained the difference between the <HI>&s;itters</HI> and the <HI>betters;</HI> characterized the fir&s;t as old rooks, and the la&s;t as bubbles; and advi&s;ed me to try my fortune at the &s;ilver table, by betting a crown at a time.&mdash;Before I would venture any thing, I con&s;idered the company more particularly, and there appeared &s;uch a group of villain|ous faces, that I was &s;truck with horror and a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;ight! I &s;ignified my &s;urpri&s;e to Banter, who whi&s;pered in my ear, that the bulk of tho&s;e pre&s;ent were &s;harpers, highwaymen, and apprentices, who having em|bezzled their ma&s;ter's ca&s;h, made a de&s;perate pu&s;h in this place, to make up their deficiencies.&mdash;This account did not encourage me to hazard any part of my &s;mall pit|tance: but at length being teized by the importunities of my friend, who a&s;&s;ured me there was no danger of being ill u&s;ed, people being hired by the owner to &s;ee ju&s;tice done to every body; I began by ri&s;king one &s;hilling, and in le&s;s th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n an hour, my winning amounted to thirty.&mdash;Convinced by this time of the fairne&s;s of the game, and
<PB N="123" REF="027715_0364_0FD5EE5BE17D3A18">
animated with &s;ucce&s;s, there was no need for any further per&s;ua&s;ion to continue the play; I lent Banter (who &s;el|dom had any money in his pocket) a guinea, which he carried to the gold table and lo&s;t in a moment.&mdash;He would have borrowed another, but finding me deaf to his argu|ments, went away in a pet.&mdash;Mean while my gain advan|ced to &s;ix pieces, and my de&s;ire of more increa&s;ed in pro|portion; &s;o that I moved to the higher table, where I laid half a guinea on every throw, and fortune &s;till fa|vouring me, I became a &s;itter, in which capacity I re|mained until it was broad day; when I found my&s;elf, af|ter many vici&s;&s;itudes, one hundred and fifty guineas in pocket.</P>
<P>Thinking it now high time to retire with my booty, I a&s;ked if any body would take my place, and made a mo|tion to ri&s;e; upon which an old Ga&s;con, who &s;at oppo&s;ite to me, and of whom I had won a little money, &s;tarted up with fury in his looks, crying, <Q><HI>Re&s;tez, foutre, re&s;tez, il faut donner moi mon ranvanchio!</HI></Q> At the &s;ame time a Jew, who &s;at near the other, in&s;inuated, that I was more beholden to art than fortune, for what I had got; that he had ob&s;erved me wipe the table very often, and that &s;ome of the divi&s;ions &s;eemed to be grea&s;y. This intima|tion produced a great deal of clamour again&s;t me, e&s;pe|cially among the lo&s;ers, who threatened with many oaths and imprecations, to take me up by a warrant as a &s;harp|er, unle&s;s I would compromi&s;e the affair by refunding the greate&s;t part of my winning.&mdash;Though I was far from being ea&s;y under this accu&s;ation, I relied upon my inno|cence, threatened in my turn to pro&s;ecute the Jew for de|famation, and boldly offered to &s;ubmit my cau&s;e to the examination of any ju&s;tice in We&s;tmin&s;ter; but they knew them&s;elves too well to put their characters on that i&s;&s;ue, and finding I was not to be intimidated into any conce&s;|&s;ion, dropped their plea, and made way for me to with|draw. I would not however &s;tir from the table until the I&s;raelite had retracted what he had &s;aid to my di&s;advan|tage, and a&s;ked pardon before the whole a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>As I marched out with my prize, I happened to tread upon the toes of a tall, raw-boned fellow, with a hooked no&s;e, fierce eyes, black thick eye-brows, a pig-tail wig of the &s;ame colour, and a formidable hat pulled over his

forehead, who &s;tood gnawing his &s;ingers in the crowd, and no &s;ooner felt the application of my &s;hoe-heel, than he roared out in a tremendous voice, <Q>Blood and wounds, you &s;on of a whore! what's that for?</Q>&mdash;I a&s;ked par|don with a great deal of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and prote&s;ted I had no intention of hurting him; but the more I humbled my&s;elf the more he &s;tormed, and in&s;i&s;ted upon gentleman|ly &s;atisfaction, at the &s;ame time provoking me with &s;can|dalous names, that I could not put up with; &s;o that I gave a loo&s;e to my pa&s;&s;ion, returned his Billing&s;gate, and challenged him to follow me down to the piazzas.&mdash;His indignation cooled as mine warmed, he refu&s;ed my invi|tation, &s;aying, he would chu&s;e his own time, and return|ed towards the table muttering threats, which I neither dreaded nor di&s;tinctly heard; but de&s;cending with great deliberation, received my &s;word from the door-keeper, whom I gratified with a guinea according to the cu&s;tom of the place, and went home in a rapture of joy.</P>
<P>My faithful valet, who had &s;at up all night in the ut|mo&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s on my account, let me in with his face be|&s;lubbered with tears, and followed me to my chamber, where he &s;tood &s;ilent like a condemned criminal, in ex|pectation of hearing that every &s;hilling was &s;pent.&mdash;I gue&s;|&s;ed the &s;ituation of his thoughts, and a&s;&s;uming a &s;ullen look, bid him fetch me &s;ome water to wa&s;h.&mdash;He replied, without lifting his eyes from the ground, <Q>In my &s;imple conjecture, you have more occa&s;ion for re&s;t, not having, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;lept the&s;e four and twenty hours.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Bring me &s;ome water,</Q> (&s;aid I in a peremptory tone;) upon which he &s;neaked away, &s;hrugging his &s;houlders. Before he returned, I had &s;pread my whole &s;tock on the table in the mo&s;t o&s;tentations manner; &s;o that when it fir&s;t &s;aluted his view, he &s;tood like one intranced, and having rubbed his eyes more than once, to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of his being awake, broke out into, <Q>Lord have mercy upon us, what a va&s;t trea&s;ure is here?</Q>&mdash;<Q>'Tis all our own, Strap,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>take what is nece&s;&s;ary, and redeem the &s;word immediately.</Q>&mdash;He advanced towards the table, &s;topt &s;hort by the way, looked at the money and me by turns, and with a wildne&s;s in his countenance, pro|duced from joy checked by di&s;tru&s;t, cried, <Q>I dare &s;ay it is hone&s;tly come by.</Q>&mdash;To remove his &s;cruples, I made

<P>Having no inclination to &s;leep, I &s;ecured my ca&s;h, dre&s;&s;ed, and was ju&s;t going abroad, when the &s;ervant of the hou&s;e told me, there was a gentlewoman at the door who wanted to &s;peak with me. Surpri&s;ed at this infor|mation, I bid Strap &s;how her up, and in le&s;s than a mi|nute &s;aw a young woman of a &s;habby decayed appearance enter my room. After half a dozen curt'&s;ies, &s;he began to &s;ob, and told me her name was Gawky; upon which I immediately recollected the features of Mi&s;s Lavement, who had been the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of my misfortunes.&mdash;Though I had all the rea&s;on in the world to re&s;ent her treacherous u&s;age of me, I was moved at her di&s;tre&s;s, and, profe&s;&s;ing my &s;orrow at &s;eeing her &s;o reduced, de&s;ired her to &s;it, and inquired into the particulars of her &s;ituation. She fell upon her knees, and implored my forgivene&s;s for the injuries &s;he had done me, prote&s;ting before God, that &s;he was forced again&s;t her inclination into that helli&s;h con|&s;piracy, which had almo&s;t deprived me of my life, by the entreaties of her hu&s;band, who, having been afterwards renounced by his father on account of his marriage with her, and unable to &s;upport a family on his pay, left his wife at her father's hou&s;e, and went with the regiment to Germany, where he was broke for mi&s;behaviour at the
<PB N="126" REF="027715_0367_0FD5EE5FD807E6B8">
battle of Dettingen, &s;ince which time &s;he had heard no tidings of him. She then gave me to under&s;tand, with many &s;ymptoms of penitence, that it was her misfortune to bear a child four months after marriage, by which her parents were &s;o incen&s;ed, that &s;he was turned out of doors with the infant, that died &s;oon after, and had hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, in a mi&s;erable indigent manner, on the extorted charity of a few friends, who were now quite tired of giving; that, not knowing where or how to &s;upport her|&s;elf one day longer, &s;he had fled for &s;uccour even to me, who of all mankind had the lea&s;t cau&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, relying upon the genero&s;ity of my di&s;po&s;ition, which, &s;he hoped, would be plea&s;ed with this opportunity of avenging it&s;elf in the noble&s;t manner on the wretch who had wronged me.&mdash;I was very much affected with her di&s;cour&s;e, and having no cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect the &s;incerity of her repentance, rai&s;ed her up, freely pardoned all &s;he had done again&s;t me, and promi&s;ed to befriend her as much as lay in my power.</P>
<P>Since my la&s;t arrival in London, I had made no ad|vances to the apothecary, imagining it would be impo&s;|&s;ible for me to make my innocence appear, &s;o unhappily was my accu&s;ation circum&s;tanced: Strap indeed had la|boured to ju&s;tify me to the &s;choolma&s;ter; but &s;o far from &s;ucceeding in his attempt, Mr. Concordance dropt all cor|re&s;pondence with him, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to quit his connection with me.&mdash;Things being in this &s;ituation, I thought a fairer opportunity of vindicating my character could not offer, than that which now pre&s;ented it&s;elf; therefore &s;tipulated with Mrs. Gawky, that before I yield|ed her the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he &s;hould do me the ju&s;tice to clear my reputation, by explaining upon oath before a magi&s;trate, the whole of the con&s;piracy, as it had been executed again&s;t me.&mdash;When &s;he had given me this &s;ati&s;|faction, I pre&s;ented her with five guineas, a &s;um &s;o much above her expectation, that &s;he could &s;carce believe the evidence of her &s;en&s;es, and was ready to wor&s;hip me for my benevolence.&mdash;The declaration, &s;igned with her own hand, I &s;ent to her father, who, upon recollecting and comparing the circum&s;tances of my charge, was convinced of my integrity, and waited on me next day, in company with his friend the &s;choolma&s;ter, to whom he had commu|nicated

<P>HAVING fini&s;hed this affair to my &s;atisfaction, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound my&s;elf perfectly at ea&s;e, and, looking upon the
<PB N="128" REF="027715_0369_0FD5EE648F152520">
gaming-table as a certain re&s;ource for a gentleman in want, became more gay than ever. Although my clothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> were almo&s;t as good as new, I grew a&s;hamed of wearing them, becau&s;e I thought every body by this time had got an inventory of my wardrobe: for which rea&s;on I di&s;po&s;ed of a good part of my apparel to a &s;ale&s;man in Monmouth &s;treet for half the value, and bought two new &s;uits with the money: I likewi&s;e purcha&s;ed a plain gold watch, de&s;|pairing of recovering that which I had &s;o fooli&s;hly given to Strutwell, whom, notwith&s;tanding, I &s;till continued to vi&s;it at his levee, until the amba&s;&s;ador he had mentioned &s;et out with a &s;ecretary of his own chu&s;ing. I thought my&s;elf then at liberty to expo&s;tulate with his lord&s;hip, whom I treated with great freedom in a letter for amu&s;ing me with vain hopes, when he neither had the power nor inclination to provide for me. Nor was I le&s;s re&s;erved with Straddle, whom I in per&s;on reproached for mi&s;repre|&s;enting to me the character of Strutwell, which I did not &s;cruple to aver was infamous in every re&s;pect. He &s;eemed very much enraged at my freedom, talked a great deal about his quality and honour, and began to make &s;ome compari&s;ons, which I thought &s;o injurious to mine, that I demanded an explanation with great warmth, and he was mean enough to equivocate, and conde&s;cend in &s;uch a manner, that I left him with an hearty contempt of his behaviour.</P>
<P>About this time Banter, who had ob&s;erved a &s;urpri&s;ing and &s;udden alteration in my appearance and di&s;po&s;ition, began to enquire very minutely into the cau&s;e, and as I did not think fit to let him know the true &s;tate of the af|fair, le&s;t he might make free with my pur&s;e, on the &s;trength of having propo&s;ed the &s;cheme that filled it, I told him that I had received a &s;mall &s;upply from a relation in the country, who at the &s;ame time had promi&s;ed to u&s;e all his intere&s;t (which was not &s;mall) in &s;oliciting &s;ome po&s;t for me, that would make me ea&s;y for life. <Q>If that be the ca&s;e,</Q> &s;aid Banter, <Q>perhaps you won't care to mortify your&s;elf a little in making your fortune ano|ther way&mdash;I have a relation who is to &s;et out for Bath next week with an only daughter, who, being &s;ickly and decrepid, intends to drink the waters for the reco|very of her health. Her father, who was a rich Tur|key

merchant, died about a year ago, and left her with a fortune of twenty thou&s;and pounds, under the &s;ole management of her mother who is my kin&s;woman. I would have put in for the plate my&s;elf, but there is a breach a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> pre&s;ent between the old woman and me. You mu&s;t know that &s;ometime ago I borrowed a &s;mall &s;um of her, and promi&s;ed, it &s;eems, to pay it before a cer|tain time; but, being di&s;appointed in my expectation of money from the country, the day elap&s;ed without my being able to take up my note; upon which, &s;he wrote a peremptory letter, threatening to arre&s;t me, if I did not pay the debt immediately: nettled at this preci&s;e behaviour, I &s;ent a damned &s;evere an&s;wer, which enra|ged her &s;o much, that &s;he actually took out a writ again&s;t me: whereupon, finding the thing grow &s;erious, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a friend to advance the money for me, di&s;charged the debt, went to her hou&s;e, and abu&s;ed her for her unfriendly dealing. She was provoked by my reproach|es, and &s;colded in her turn. The little deformed urchin joined her mother with &s;uch virulence and volubility of tongue, that I was fain to make my retreat, after ha|ving been honoured with a great many &s;candalous epi|thets, which gave me plainly to under&s;tand, that I had nothing to expect from the e&s;teem of the one, or the af|fection of the other. As they are both utter &s;trangers to life, it is a thou&s;and to one but the girl will be pick|ed up by &s;ome &s;coundrel or other at Bath, if I don't provide for her otherwi&s;e. You are a well-looking fel|low, Random, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> behave as demurely as a Quaker. Now, if you will give me an obligation for five hundred pounds to be paid &s;ix months after your marriage, I will put you in a method of carrying her in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition.</Q></P>
<P>This propo&s;al was too advantageous for me to be refu|&s;ed: the writing was immediately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> up, and executed; and Banter giving me notice of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> time when, and the &s;tage-coach in which they were to for out, I be&s;poke a place in the &s;ame convenience, and having hired a hor&s;e for Strap, who was charmed with the project, &s;et out ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>As we embarked before day, I had not the plea&s;ure for &s;ome time of &s;eeing Mi&s;s Snapper, (that wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the name of

"Little more than two miles," &s;aid &s;he. "By Gad you're a wit, madam," cried the officer. <Q>I wi&s;h I could with any ju&s;tice return the com|pliment,</Q> &s;aid the lady. "Zounds!&mdash;I have done," &s;aid he. <Q>Your bolt is &s;oon &s;hot, according to the pro|verb,</Q> &s;aid &s;he. The warrior's powder was quite &s;pent; the lawyer advi&s;ed him to drop the pro&s;ecution; and a grave matron, who &s;at on the left hand of the victorious wit, told her &s;he mu&s;t not let her tongue run &s;o fa&s;t among &s;trangers. This reprimand, &s;oftened with the appellation of child, convinced me, that the &s;atirical lady was no other than Mi&s;s Snapper, and I re&s;olved to regulate my conduct accordingly. The champion, finding him&s;elf &s;o &s;martly handled, changed his battery, and began to expa|tiate on his own exploits. "You talk of &s;hot, Madam," &s;aid he, <Q>damme! I have both given and received &s;ome &s;hot in my time&mdash;I was wounded in the &s;houlder by a

<P>Having vented this repetition of expletive, the lawyer owned he had not been requited according to his de&s;erts, ob&s;erved that the labourer is always worthy of his hire,

<Q><L>Would you ta&s;k the moon-ty'd hair,</L>
<L>To you flagrant beau repair;</L>
<L>Where, waving with the poppling vow,</L>
<L>The bantling fine will &s;helter you, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
The &s;en&s;e of the re&s;t he perverted, as he went on, with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing facility, that I could not help thinking he had been at &s;ome pains to burle&s;que the performance. Mi&s;s Snapper a&s;cribed it to the true cau&s;e, namely, igno|rance, and, when he a&s;ked her how &s;he reli&s;hed the mu&s;ic, an&s;wered, in her opinion, the mu&s;ic and the words were much of a piece. "O! d&mdash;n my blood!' &s;aid he, <Q>I take that as a high compliment; for every body allows the words are damnable fine.</Q> "They may be &s;o," replied the lady, <Q>for aught I know, but they are above my comprehen&s;ion.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I an't obliged to find you com|prehen&s;ion, Madam, cur&s;e me!</Q> cried he.&mdash;<Q>No, nor to &s;peak &s;en&s;e neither,</Q> &s;aid &s;he.&mdash;"D&mdash;n my heart," &s;aid he, "I'll &s;peak what I plea&s;e."

"As for the king," cried the &s;oldier, <Q>God ble&s;s him&mdash;I eat his bread, and have lo&s;t blood in his cau&s;e, therefore I have nothing to &s;ay

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the mean time day breaking in upon us, di&s;covered to one another the faces of their fellow-travellers, and I had the good fortune to find my mi&s;tre&s;s not quite &s;o deformed nor di&s;agreeable as &s;he had been repre&s;ented to me. Her head, indeed, bore &s;ome re&s;emblance to a hatch|et, the edge being repre&s;ented by her face; but &s;he had a certain delicacy in her complexion, and a great deal of vivacity in her eyes, which were very large and black; and though the protuberance of her brea&s;t, when con&s;i|dered alone, &s;eemed to drag her forwards, it was ea&s;y to perceive an equivalent on her back which balanced the other, and kept her body in <HI>equilibrio.</HI> On the whole, I thought I &s;hould have great rea&s;on to congratulate my&s;elf,
<PB N="134" REF="027715_0375_0FD5EE6D56CFA150">
if it &s;hould be my fate to po&s;&s;e&s;s twenty thou&s;and pounds encumbered with &s;uch a wife. I began, therefore, to de|liberate about the mo&s;t probable means of acquiring the conque&s;t, and was &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by this idea, that I &s;carce took any notice of the re&s;t of the people in the coach, but revolved my pro&s;pect in &s;ilence, while the con|ver&s;ation was maintained as before by the object of my hopes, the &s;on of Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and the barri&s;ter, who by this time had recollected him&s;elf, and talked in terms as much as ever. At length a di&s;pute happened, which ended in a wager to be determined by me, who was &s;o much ab&s;orbed in contemplation, that I neither heard the reference nor the que&s;tion which was put to me by each in his turn. Affronted at my &s;uppo&s;ed contempt, the &s;oldier with great vociferation &s;wore, I was either dumb or deaf, if not both, and that I looked as if I could not &s;ay <HI>boh to a goo&s;e.</HI>&mdash;Arou&s;ed at this ob&s;ervation, I fixed my eyes upon him, and pronounced with empha&s;is the interjection <HI>boh!</HI> Upon which he cocked his hat in a fierce manner, and cried, "Damme, Sir, what d'ye mean by that?" Had I in|tended to an&s;wer him, which by the bye was not my de|&s;ign, I &s;hould have been anticipated by mi&s;s, who told him my meaning was to &s;hew, that I could cry <HI>boh</HI> to a goo&s;e, and laughed very heartily at my laconic reproof. Her explanation and mirth did not help to appea&s;e his wrath which broke out in &s;everal martial in&s;inuations, &s;uch as&mdash;<Q>I do not under&s;tand &s;uch freedoms, damme!&mdash;D&mdash;n my blood! I'm a gentleman, and bear the king's commi&s;&s;ion&mdash;'Sblood! &s;ome people de&s;erve to have their no&s;es pulled for their impertinence.</Q> I thought to have checked the&s;e ejaculations by a frown, becau&s;e he had talked &s;o much of his valour, that I had long ago rated him an a&s;s in a lion's &s;kin; but, &s;o far from an&s;wer|ing my expectations, he took umbrage at the contraction of my brows, &s;wore he did not value my &s;ulky look a fig's end, and prote&s;ted he feared no man breathing. Mi&s;s Snapper &s;aid, &s;he was very glad to find her&s;elf in company with a man of &s;o much courage, who &s;he did not doubt would protect us all from the attempts of highwaymen during our journey. <Q>Make your&s;elf perfectly ea&s;y on that head, Madam,</Q> replied the officer; <Q>I have got a pair of pi&s;tols (here they are) which I took from a

hor&s;e-officer at the battle of Dettingen&mdash;they are dou|ble-loaded, and if any highwayman in England robs you of the value of a pin, while I have the honour of being in your company, d&mdash;n my heart.</Q> When he had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in this manner, a prim gentlewoman, who had &s;at &s;ilent hitherto, opened her mouth, and &s;aid, &s;he wondered how any man could be &s;o rude as to pull out &s;uch weapons before ladies. "Damme, Madam," cried the champion, <Q>if you are &s;o much afraid at &s;ight of a pi&s;tol, how d'ye propo&s;e to &s;tand fire if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion?</Q> She then told him, that if &s;he thought he could be &s;o unmannerly as to u&s;e fire arms in her pre&s;ence, whatever might be the occa&s;ion, &s;he would get out of the coach immediately, and walk to the next village, where &s;he might procure a convenience to her&s;elf. Before he could make any an&s;wer, my Dulcinea interpo&s;ed, and ob|&s;erved, that, &s;o far from being offended at a gentleman's u&s;ing his arms in his own defence, &s;he thought her&s;elf very lucky in being along with one by who&s;e valour &s;he &s;tood a good chance of &s;aving her&s;elf from being rifled. The prude ca&s;t a di&s;dainful look at mi&s;s, and &s;aid, that people who had but little to lo&s;e are &s;ometimes the mo&s;t &s;olicitous about pre&s;erving it. The old lady was affronted at this inuendo, and took notice, that people ought to be very well informed before they &s;peak &s;lightingly of other people's fortunes, le&s;t they di&s;cover their own envy, and make them|&s;elves ridiculous. The daughter declared, that &s;he did not pretend to vie with any body in point of riches, and if the lady who in&s;i&s;ted upon non-re&s;i&s;tance, would promi&s;e to in|demnify us all for the lo&s;s we &s;hould &s;u&s;tain, &s;he would be one of the fir&s;t to per&s;uade the captain to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, in ca&s;e we &s;hould be attacked. To this propo&s;al, rea&s;onable as it was, the re&s;erved lady made no other reply than a &s;cornful glance, and a to&s;s of her head. I was very well plea&s;ed with the &s;pirit of my mi&s;tre&s;s, and even wi&s;hed for an opportunity of di&s;tingui&s;hing my courage under her eye, which I believed could not fail of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her in my fa|vour, when all of a &s;udden Strap rode up to the coach-door, and told us in a great fright, that two men on hor&s;eback were cro&s;&s;ing the heath, (for by this time we had pa&s;&s;ed Houn&s;low,) and made directly towards us.

began to &s;cream, her daughter grew pale, the other lady pulled out her pur&s;e to be in readine&s;s, the lawyer's teeth chattered, while he pronounced, <Q>'Tis no matter&mdash;we'll &s;ue the county, and recover;</Q> the captain gave evident &s;igns of confu&s;ion, and I, after having commanded the coachman to &s;top, opened the doo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, jumped out, and in|vited the warrior to follow me: but, finding him back|ward and a&s;toni&s;hed, I took his pi&s;tols, and giving them to Strap, who, by this time, had alighted, and trembled very much, I mounted on hor&s;eback; and taking my own (which I could better depend upon) from the hol&s;ters, cocked them both, and faced the robbers, who were now very near us. Seeing me ready to oppo&s;e them on hor&s;e|back, and another man armed a-foot, they made a halt, at &s;ome di&s;tance to reconnoitre us, and after having rode round us twice, my&s;elf &s;till facing about as they rode, went off, the &s;ame way they came, at a hand gallop. A gentleman's &s;ervant coming up with a hor&s;e at the &s;ame time, I offered him a crown to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in pur&s;uing them, which he no &s;ooner accepted than I armed him with the officer's pi&s;tols, and we galloped after the thieves, who, tru&s;ting to the &s;wiftne&s;s of their hor&s;es, &s;topped till we came within &s;hot of them, and then firing at us, put their nags to the full &s;peed. We followed them as fa&s;t as our bea&s;ts could carry us, but not being &s;o well mounted as they, our efforts would have been to little purpo&s;e, had not the hor&s;e of one of them &s;tumbled, and thrown his rider with &s;uch violence over his head, that he lay &s;en&s;e|le&s;s when we came up, and was taken without the lea&s;t op|po&s;ition, while his comrade con&s;ulted his own &s;afety in flight, without regarding the di&s;tre&s;s of his friend. We &s;carce had time to make our&s;elves ma&s;ters of his arms, and tie his hands together, before he recovered his &s;en&s;es, when, learning his &s;ituation, he affected &s;urprize, demanded to know by what authority we u&s;ed a gentleman in that manner, and had the impudence to threaten us with a pro&s;ecution for robbery. In the mean time we perceived Strap coming up with a crowd of people armed with dif|ferent kinds of weapons, and among the re&s;t a farmer, who no &s;ooner perceived the thief whom we had &s;ecured, than he cried with great emotion, <Q>There's the fellow who robbed me an hour ago of twenty pounds in a
<PB N="137" REF="027715_0378_0FD5EE74DC666E78">
canvas bag.</Q> He was immediately &s;earched, and the money &s;ound exactly as it had been de&s;cribed: upon which, we committed him to the charge of the countryman, who carried him to the town of Houn&s;low, which it &s;eems the farmer had alarmed; and I having &s;atisfied the footman for his trouble, according to promi&s;e, returned with Strap to the coach, where I found the captain and lawyer bu&s;y in admini&s;tering &s;melling-bottles and cordials to the grave lady, who had gone into a fit at the noi&s;e of the firing.</P>
<P>When I had taken my &s;eat, Mi&s;s Snapper, who from the coach had &s;een every thing that happened, made me a compliment on my behaviour, and &s;aid &s;he was glad to &s;ee me returned, without having received any injury; her mother too owned her&s;elf obliged to my re&s;olution; and the lawyer told me, that I was entitled by act of parlia|ment to a reward of forty pounds, for having apprehend|ed a highwayman.&mdash;The &s;oldier ob&s;erved, with a counte|nance in which impudence and &s;hame &s;truggling produced &s;ome di&s;order, that if I had not been in &s;uch a damned hurry to get out of the coach, he would have &s;ecured the rogues effectually, without all this bu&s;tle and lo&s;s of time, by a &s;cheme which my heat and precipitation ruined.&mdash;"For my own part," continued he, <Q>I am always ex|tremely cool on the&s;e occa&s;ions.</Q>&mdash;<Q>So it appeared by your trembling,</Q> &s;aid the young lady.&mdash;<Q>Death and damnation!</Q> cried he, <Q>your &s;ex protects you, Ma|dam: if any man on earth dur&s;t tell me &s;o much, I'd &s;end him to hell, damn my heart! in an in&s;tant.</Q>&mdash;So &s;aying, he fixed his eyes upon me, and a&s;ked if I had &s;een him tremble.&mdash;I an&s;wered without he&s;itation, "Yes."&mdash;"Damme, Sir," &s;aid he, "d'ye doubt my courage?"&mdash;I replied, "Very much."&mdash;This declaration quite di&s;|concerted him.&mdash;He looked blank, and pronounced with a faultering voice, <Q>Oh! 'tis very well&mdash;D&mdash;n my blood! I &s;hall find a time.</Q>&mdash;I &s;ignified my contempt of him, by thru&s;ting my tongue in my cheek, which humbled him &s;o much, that he &s;carce &s;wore another oath aloud during the whole journey.</P>
<P>The preci&s;e lady, having recruited her &s;pirits by the help of &s;ome &s;trong waters, began a &s;oliloquy, in which &s;he wondered that any man who pretended to maintain the character of a gentleman, could, for the &s;ake of a little
<PB N="138" REF="027715_0379_0FD5EE76CA38CE58">
paultry coin, throw per&s;ons of honour into &s;uch quan|daries as might endanger their lives; and profe&s;&s;ed her &s;urprize, that women were not a&s;hamed to commend &s;uch brutality. At the &s;ame time vowing, that for the future &s;he would never &s;et foot in a &s;tage-coach, if a private con|venience could be had for love or money.</P>
<P>Nettled at her remarks, I took the &s;ame method of con|veying my &s;entiments, and wondered in my turn, that any woman of common &s;en&s;e &s;hould be &s;o unrea&s;onable as to expect that people, who had neither acquaintance nor connection with her, would tamely allow them&s;elves to be robbed and mal-treated, merely to indulge her capricious humour. I likewi&s;e profe&s;&s;ed my a&s;toni&s;hment at her in|&s;olence and ingratitude in taxing a per&s;on with brutality, who de&s;erved her approbation and acknowledgment; and vowed, that if ever we &s;hould be a&s;&s;aulted again, I would leave her to the mercy of the &s;poiler, that &s;he might know the value of my protection.</P>
<P>This per&s;on of honour did not think fit to carry on the altercation any further, but &s;eemed to chew the cud of her re&s;entment with the cre&s;t-fallen captain, while I en|tered into di&s;cour&s;e with my charmer, who was the more plea&s;ed with my conver&s;ation, as &s;he had conceived a very indifferent opinion of my intellects from my former &s;ilence. I &s;hould have had cau&s;e to be equally &s;atisfied with the &s;prightline&s;s of her genius, could &s;he have curbed her ima|gination with judgment; but &s;he laboured under &s;uch a profu&s;ion of talk, that I dreaded her unruly tongue, and felt by anticipation the horrors of an eternal clack! How|ever, when I con&s;idered on the other hand, the joys at|tending the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of twenty thou&s;and pounds, I for|got her imperfections, &s;eized occa&s;ion by the forelock, and endeavoured to in&s;inuate my&s;elf into her affection.&mdash;The careful mother kept a &s;trict watch over her, and though &s;he could not help behaving civilly to me, took frequent opportunities of di&s;couraging our communica|tion, by reprimanding her for being &s;o free with &s;trangers and telling her &s;he mu&s;t learn to &s;peak le&s;s and think more.&mdash;Abridged of the u&s;e of &s;peech, we conver&s;ed with our eyes, and found the young lady very eloquent in this kind of di&s;cour&s;e. In &s;hort, I had rea&s;on to believe, that &s;he was &s;ick of the old gentlewoman's tuition, and
<PB N="139" REF="027715_0380_0FD5EE7A5EDB94F8">
that I &s;hould find it no difficult matter to &s;uper&s;ede her authority.</P>
<P>When we arrived at the place where we were to break|fa&s;t, I alighted, and helped my mi&s;tre&s;s out of the coach, as well as her mother, who called for a private room, to which they withdrew, in order to eat by them&s;elves.&mdash;As they retired together, I perceived that Mi&s;s had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> more twi&s;ts from nature than I had before ob&s;erved, being bent &s;ideways into the figure of an S, &s;o that her progre&s;&s;ion very much re&s;embled that of a crab.&mdash;The prude al&s;o cho&s;e the captain for her me&s;s-mate, and ordered break|fa&s;t for two only to be brought into another &s;eparate room; while the lawyer and I, de&s;erted by the re&s;t of the company, were fain to put up with each other. I was a good deal chagrined at the &s;tately re&s;erve of Mrs. Snap|per, who I thought did not u&s;e me with all the complai|&s;ance I de&s;erved; and my companion declared, that he had been a traveller the&s;e twenty years, and never knew the &s;tage-coach rules &s;o much infringed before. As for the honourable gentlewoman, I could not conceive the meaning of her attachment to the lieutenant; and a&s;ked the law|yer if he knew for which of the &s;oldier's virtues &s;he ad|mired him; the coun&s;ellor facetiou&s;ly replied, <Q>I &s;uppo&s;e the lady knows him to be an able conveyancer, and wants him to make a &s;ettlement intail.</Q>&mdash;I could not help laughing at the archne&s;s of the barri&s;ter, who entertained me during breakfa&s;t with a good deal of wit of the &s;ame kind, at the expence of our fellow-travellers; and among other things &s;aid, he was &s;orry to find the young lady &s;ad|dled with &s;uch incumbrances.</P>
<P>When we had made an end of our repa&s;t, and paid our reckoning, we went into the coach, took our places, and bribed the driver with &s;ixpence, to revenge us on the re&s;t of his fare, by hurrying them away in the mid&s;t of their meal.&mdash;This he performed to our &s;atisfaction, after he had di&s;turbed their enjoyment with his importunate clamour. The mother and daughter obeyed the &s;ummons fir&s;t, and coming to the coach door, were obliged to de&s;ire the coachman's a&s;&s;i&s;tance to get in, becau&s;e the lawyer and I had agreed to &s;hew our re&s;entment by our neglect.&mdash;They were no &s;ooner &s;eated than the captain appeared, as much heated as if he had been pur&s;ued a dozen miles by an ene|my;
<PB N="140" REF="027715_0381_0FD5EE7CEFE45488">
and immediately after him came the lady, not with|out &s;ome marks of di&s;order.&mdash;Having helped her up, he entered him&s;elf, growling a few oaths again&s;t the coach|man for his impertinent interruption; and the lawyer com|forted him by &s;aying, that if he had &s;uffered a <HI>ni&s;i prius</HI> through the ob&s;tinacy of the defendant, he might have an opportunity to join i&s;&s;ue at the next &s;tage. This la&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ion gave offence to the grave gentlewoman, who told him, if &s;he was a man, &s;he would make him repent of &s;uch ob&s;cenity, and thanked God &s;he had never been in &s;uch company before.&mdash;At this in&s;inuation, the captain thought him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;pou&s;ing the lady's cau&s;e; and accordingly threatened to cut off the lawyer's ears, if he &s;hould give his tongue any &s;uch liberties for the fu|ture. The poor coun&s;ellor begged pardon, and univer&s;al &s;ilence en&s;ued.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>DURING this un&s;ocial interval my pride and intere&s;t maintained a &s;evere conflict, on the &s;ubject of Mi&s;s Snapper, whom the one repre&s;ented as unworthy of my notice, and the other propo&s;ed as the object of my whole
<PB N="141" REF="027715_0382_0FD5EE7DDFB7D7B0">
attention; the advantages and di&s;advantages attending &s;uch a match, were oppo&s;ed to one another by my ima|gination; and at length my judgment gave it &s;o much in favour of the fir&s;t, that I re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute my &s;cheme, with all the addre&s;s in my power.&mdash;I thought I perceived &s;ome concern in her countenance, occa&s;ioned by my &s;ilence, which &s;he no doubt imputed to my di&s;gu&s;t at her mother's behaviour; and as I believed the old woman could not fail of a&s;cribing my mutene&s;s to the &s;ame motive, I de|termined to continue that &s;ullen conduct towards her, and fall upon &s;ome other method of manife&s;ting my e&s;teem for the daughter; nor was it difficult for me to make her ac|quainted with my &s;entiments by the expre&s;&s;ion of my looks, which I modelled into the characters of humility and love; and which were an&s;wered by her with all the &s;ympathy and approbation I could de&s;ire. But when I began to con&s;ider, that without further opportunities of improving my &s;ucce&s;s, all the progre&s;s I had hitherto made could not much avail, and that &s;uch opportunities could not be enjoyed without the mother's permi&s;&s;ion, I con|cluded, it would be requi&s;ite to vanqui&s;h her coldne&s;s and &s;u&s;picion, by my a&s;&s;iduities and re&s;pectful behaviour on the road; and &s;he would in all likelihood invite me to vi|&s;it her at Bath, where I did not fear of being able to cultivate her acquaintance as much as would be nece&s;&s;ary to the accompli&s;hment of my purpo&s;e.&mdash;And, indeed, ac|cident furni&s;hed me with an opportunity of obliging her &s;o much, that &s;he could not, with any appearance of good manners, forbear to gratify my inclination.</P>
<P>When we arrived at our dining-place, we found all the eatables in the inn be&s;poke by a certain nobleman, who had got the &s;tart of us; and in all likelihood, my mi&s;tre&s;s and her mother mu&s;t have dined with Duke Humphrey, had I not exerted my&s;elf in their behalf, and bribed the landlord with a gla&s;s of wine, to curtail his Lord&s;hip's entertainment of a couple of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;ome bacon, which I &s;ent with my compliments to the ladies; they accepted my treat with a great many thanks, and de&s;ired I would favour them with my company at dinner, where I amu&s;ed the old gentlewoman &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, by maintaining a &s;eemingly di&s;intere&s;ted ea&s;e, in the mid&s;t of my civility, that &s;he &s;ignified a de&s;ire of being better acquainted, and
<PB N="142" REF="027715_0383_0FD5EE7F918E1848">
hoped I would be &s;o kind as to &s;ee her &s;ometimes at Bath.&mdash;While I enjoyed my&s;elf in this manner, the preci&s;e la|dy had the good fortune to meet with her hu&s;band, who was no other than gentleman, or in other words, <HI>valet de chambre</HI> to the very nobleman who&s;e coach &s;tood at the door. Proud of the intere&s;t &s;he had in the hou&s;e, &s;he af|fected to &s;hew her power, by introducing the captain to her &s;pou&s;e, as a per&s;on who had treated her with great ci|vility; upon which he was invited to a &s;hare of their din|ner; while the poor lawyer finding him&s;elf utterly aban|doned, made application to me, and was, through my interce&s;&s;ion, admitted into our company.&mdash;Having &s;ati&s;|fied our appetites, and made our&s;elves very merry at the expence of the per&s;on of honour, the civil captain and complai&s;ant hu&s;band, I did my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of di&s;charg|ing the bill by &s;tealth, for which I received a great ma|ny apologies and acknowledgments from my gue&s;ts, and we re-imbarked at the fir&s;t warning.&mdash;The officer was obliged at la&s;t to appea&s;e his hunger with a luncheon of bread and chee&s;e, and a pint bottle of brandy, which he di&s;patched in the coach, cur&s;ing the inappetence of his Lord&s;hip, who had ordered dinner to be put back a whole hour.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of our journey, which was ended about twelve o'clock, when I waited on the ladies to the hou&s;e of a relation, in which they intended to lodge, and pa&s;&s;ing that night in the inn, took lodgings next morning for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The forenoon was &s;pent in vi&s;iting every thing that was worth &s;eeing in the place, which I did in company with a gentleman to whom Banter had given me a letter of introduction; and in the afternoon I waited on the ladies, and found Mi&s;s a good deal indi&s;po&s;ed with the fatigues of the journey.&mdash;As they fore&s;aw they &s;hould have occa|&s;ion for a male acquaintance, to &s;quire them at all public places, I was received with great cordiality, and had the mother's permi&s;&s;ion to conduct them next day to the Long Room, which we no &s;ooner entered, than the eyes of every body pre&s;ent were turned upon us; and whem we had &s;uffered the martyrdom of their looks for &s;ome time, a whi&s;per circulated at our expence, which was ac|companied with many contemptuous &s;miles, and tittering
<PB N="143" REF="027715_0384_0FD5EE816D96DA48">
ob&s;ervations, to my utter &s;hame and confu&s;ion.&mdash;I did not &s;o much conduct as follow my charge to a place, where &s;he &s;eated her mother and her&s;elf, with a&s;toni&s;hing com|po&s;ure, notwith&s;tanding the unmannerly behaviour of the whole company; which &s;eemed to be a&s;&s;umed merely to put her out of countenance.&mdash;The celebrated Mr. N&mdash;&s;h, who commonly attends in this place as ma&s;ter of the ce|remonies, perceiving the di&s;po&s;ition of the a&s;&s;embly, took upon him&s;elf the ta&s;k of gratifying their ill nature &s;till farther, by expo&s;ing my mi&s;tre&s;s to the edge of his wit. With this view he approached us with many bows and grimaces, and after having welcomed Mi&s;s Snapper to the place, a&s;ked her, in the hearing of all pre&s;ent, if &s;he could inform him of the name of Tobit's dog&mdash;I was &s;o much incen&s;ed at his in&s;olence, that I &s;hould certainly have kicked him where he &s;tood, without ceremony, had not the young lady prevented the effects of my indigna|tion, by replying, with the utmo&s;t vivacity, <Q>His name was N&mdash;&s;h, and an impudent dog he was.</Q> This re|partee, &s;o unexpected and ju&s;t, rai&s;ed &s;uch an univer&s;al laugh at the aggre&s;&s;or, that all his a&s;&s;urance was in&s;ufficient to &s;upport him under their deri&s;ion; &s;o that after he had endeavoured to compo&s;e him&s;elf by taking &s;nuff, and for|cing a &s;mile, he was obliged to &s;neak off in a very ludi|crous attitude; while my Dulcinea was applauded to the &s;kies, for the brilliancy of her wit, and her acquaintance immediately courted by the be&s;t people of both &s;exes in the room.&mdash;This event, with which I was infinitely plea|&s;ed at fir&s;t, did not fail of alarming me, upon further re|flection, when I con&s;idered, that the more &s;he was care&s;|&s;ed by per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, the more her pride would be inflamed, and con&s;equently the ob&s;tacles to my &s;ucce&s;s multiplied and enlarged.&mdash;Nor were my pre&s;aging fears untrue.&mdash;That very night I perceived her a little intoxi|cated with the incen&s;e &s;he had received, and though &s;he &s;till behaved with a particular civility to me, I fore&s;aw that, as &s;oon as her fortune &s;hould be known, &s;he would be &s;urrounded with a &s;warm of admirers, &s;ome one of whom might po&s;&s;ibly, by excelling me in point of wealth, or in the arts of flattery or &s;candal, &s;upplant me in her e&s;teem, and find means to make the mother of his party. I re&s;olved, therefore, to lo&s;e no time, and, being invited
<PB N="144" REF="027715_0385_0FD5EE831D095598">
to &s;pend the evening with them, &s;ound an opportunity, in &s;pite of the old gentlewoman's vigilance, to explain the meaning of my glances in the coach, by paying homage to her wit, and profe&s;&s;ing my&s;elf enamoured of her per&s;on.&mdash;She blu&s;hed at my declaration, and in a favourable manner di&s;approved of the liberty I had taken, putting me in mind of our being &s;trangers to each other, and de&s;iring I would not be the means of interrupting our acquaintance, by any &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable &s;trokes of gallantry for the fu|ture.&mdash;My ardour was effectually checked by this repri|mand, which was, however, delivered in &s;uch a gentle manner, that I had no cau&s;e to be di&s;obliged; and the arrival of her mother relieved me from a dilemma, in which I &s;hould not have known how to demean my&s;elf a mi|nute longer.&mdash;Neither could I re&s;ume the ea&s;ine&s;s of carri|age with which I came in, my mi&s;tre&s;s acted on the re&s;erve, and the conver&s;ation beginning to flag, the old lady in|troduced her kin&s;woman of the hou&s;e, and propo&s;ed a hand at whi&s;t.</P>
<P>While we amu&s;ed our&s;elves at this diver&s;ion, I under|&s;tood from the gentlewoman, that there was to be an a&s;|&s;embly next night, at which I begged to have the honour of dancing with Mi&s;s. She thanked me for the favour I intended her, a&s;&s;ured me &s;he never did dance, but &s;igni|fied a de&s;ire of &s;eeing the company; when I offered my &s;er|vice, which was accepted, not a little proud of being ex|empted from appearing with her in a &s;ituation, that, not|with&s;tanding my profe&s;&s;ion to the contrary, was not at all agreeable to my inclination.</P>
<P>Having &s;upped, and continued the game, till &s;uch time as the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive yawns of the mother warned me to be gone, I took my leave, and went home, where I made Strap very happy with an account of my progre&s;s.&mdash;Next day I put on my gaye&s;t apparel, and went to drink tea at Mrs. Snapper's, according to appointment, when I found to my inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction, that &s;he was laid up with the tooth-ach, and that Mi&s;s was to be entru&s;ted to my care.&mdash;Accordingly we &s;et out for the ball-room, pretty early in the evening, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a com|modious place, where we had not &s;at longer than a quar|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r of an hour, when a gentleman dre&s;&s;ed in a green frock came in, leading a young lady, whom I immediately di&s;|covered

to be the adorable Narci&s;&s;a! Good Heaven! what were the thrillings of my &s;oul at that in&s;tant! my reflec|tion was overwhelmed with a torrent of agitation! my heart throbbed with &s;urpri&s;ing violence! a &s;udden mi&s;t over&s;pread my eyes! my ears were invaded with a dread|ful &s;ound!

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the afternoon I drank tea at the hou&s;e of Mr. Free|man, to whom I had been recommended by Banter, where I had not &s;at five minutes till the fox hunter came in, and, by his familiar behaviour, appeared to be inti|mate with my friend. I was at fir&s;t under &s;ome concern, le&s;t he &s;hould recollect my features; but when I &s;ound my&s;elf introduced to him as a gentleman from London, without being di&s;covered, I ble&s;&s;ed the opportunity that brought me into his company, hoping that, in the cour&s;e of our acquaintance, he would invite me to his hou&s;e&mdash;nor were my hopes fru&s;trated; for, as we &s;pent the evening to|gether, he grew extremely fond of my conver&s;ation, a&s;ked a great many childi&s;h que&s;tions about France and other fo|reign parts, and &s;eemed &s;o highly entertained with my an|&s;wers, that in his cups he &s;hook me often by the hand, pro|nounced

me an hone&s;t fellow, and, in fine, de&s;ired our com|pany at dinner next day at his own hou&s;e. My imagination was &s;o much employed in anticipating the happine&s;s I was to enjoy the next day, that I &s;lept very little that night, but, ri&s;ing up early in the morning, went to the place ap|pointed, where I met my &s;he-friend, and imparted to her my &s;ucce&s;s with the &s;quire. She was much plea&s;ed at the occa&s;ion, which &s;he &s;aid could not fail of being agree|able to Narci&s;&s;a, who, in &s;pite of her pa&s;&s;ion for me, had mentioned &s;ome &s;cruples relating to my true &s;ituation and character, which the delicacy of her &s;entiments &s;ugge&s;ted, and which &s;he believed I would find it nece&s;&s;ary to remove, though &s;he did not know how. I was a good deal &s;tartled at this in&s;inuation, becau&s;e I fore&s;aw the difficulty I &s;hould find in barely doing my&s;elf ju&s;tice: for although it never was my intention to impo&s;e my&s;elf upon any woman, much le&s;s on Narci&s;&s;a, as a man of fortune, I laid claim to the character of a gentleman by birth, education, and behaviour; and yet (&s;o unlucky had the circum&s;tances of my life fallen out) I &s;hould find it a very hard matter to make good my preten&s;ions even to the&s;e, e&s;pecially to the la&s;t, which was the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential. Mi&s;s Williams was as &s;en&s;ible as I of this my di&s;advantage, but comforted me with ob&s;erving, that, when once a woman has be&s;towed her affections on a man, &s;he cannot help judging of him, in all re&s;pects, with a partiality ea&s;ily influenced in his favour&mdash;&s;he remarked, that although &s;ome &s;ituations of my life had been low, yet none of them had been infamous; that my indigence had been the crime, not of me, but of fortune; and that the mi&s;eries I had undergone, by im|proving the faculties both of mind and body, qualified me the more for any dignified &s;tation, and would, of con&s;e|quence, recommend me to the good graces of any &s;en&s;ible woman&mdash;&s;he therefore advi&s;ed me to be always open and unre&s;erved to the inquiries of my mi&s;tre&s;s, without unne|ce&s;&s;arily betraying the meane&s;t occurrences of my fate, and tru&s;t to the &s;trength of her love and reflection for the re&s;t. The &s;entiments of this &s;en&s;ible young woman on this, as well as on almo&s;t every other &s;ubject, perfectly agreed with mine; I thanked her for the care &s;he took of my intere&s;ts, and, promi&s;ing to behave my&s;elf according to her direction, we parted, after &s;he had a&s;&s;ured me that I might depend

upon her be&s;t offices with her mi&s;tre&s;s, and that &s;he would, from time to time, communicate to me &s;uch intelligence as &s;he &s;hould procure, relating to my flame. Having dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the be&s;t advantage, I waited for the time of din|ner with the mo&s;t fearful impatience, and, as the hour drew nigh, my heart beat with &s;uch increa&s;ed velocity, and my &s;pirits contracted &s;uch di&s;order, that I began to &s;u&s;pect my re&s;olution, and even to wi&s;h my&s;elf di&s;engaged. At la&s;t Mr. Freeman called at my lodgings in his way, and I accompanied him to the hou&s;e where all my happine&s;s was depo&s;ited. We were very kindly received by the &s;quire, who &s;at &s;moaking his pipe in a parlour, and a&s;ked if we cho&s;e to drink any thing before dinner? Though I never had more occa&s;ion for a cordial, I was a&s;hamed to accept his offer, which was al&s;o refu&s;ed by my friend. We &s;at down, however, and entered into conver&s;ation, which la&s;ted half an hour, &s;o that I had time to recollect my&s;elf, and (&s;o capricious were my thoughts) even to hope that Narci&s;&s;a would not appear&mdash;when all of a &s;udden a &s;ervant, coming in, gave us notice, that dinner was upon the table&mdash;and my perturbation returned with &s;uch vio|lence, that I could &s;carce conceal it from the company as I a&s;cended the &s;tair-ca&s;e. When I entered the dining|room, the fir&s;t object that &s;aluted my ravi&s;hed eyes was the divine Narci&s;&s;a, blu&s;hing like Aurora, adorned with all the graces that meekne&s;s, innocence and beauty can diffu&s;e! I was &s;eized with a giddine&s;s, my knees tottered, and I &s;carce had &s;en&s;e enough to perform the ceremony of &s;alutation, when her brother, &s;lapping me on the &s;houl|der, cried, "Mea&s;ter Random, that there is my &s;i&s;ter." I approached her with eagerne&s;s and fear, but in the mo|ment of our embrace, my &s;oul was agonized with rapture! It was a lucky circum&s;tance for us both, that my enter|tainer was not endued with an uncommon &s;tock of pene|tration; for our mutual confu&s;ion was &s;o manife&s;t, that Mr. Freeman perceived it, and, as we went home toge|ther, congratulated me on my good fortune. But &s;o far was Bruin from entertaining the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion, that he encouraged me to begin a conver&s;ation with my mi&s;tre&s;s in a language unknown to him, by telling her, that he had brought a gentleman (meaning me) who could jabber with her, in French and other foreign lingos, as fa&s;t as &s;he

plea&s;ed; then, turning to me, &s;aid, <Q>Odds bobs! I wi&s;h you would hold di&s;cour&s;e with her in your French or Ital<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ano, and tell me if &s;he under&s;tands it as well as &s;he would be thought to do. There's her aunt and &s;he will chatter together whole days in it, and I can't have a mouthful of Engli&s;h for love or money.</Q> I con&s;ulted the looks of my amiable mi&s;tre&s;s, and found her aver&s;e to his propo&s;al, which indeed &s;he declined with a &s;weetne&s;s of denial peculiar to her&s;elf, as a piece of di&s;re&s;pect to that part of the company which did not under&s;tand the lan|guage in que&s;tion. As I had the happine&s;s of &s;itting op|po&s;ite to her, I fea&s;ted my eyes much more than my pa|late, which &s;he tempted in vain with the mo&s;t delicious bits carved by her fair hand, and recommended by her per&s;ua&s;ive tongue&mdash;but all my other appetites were &s;wal|lowed up in the immen&s;ity of my love, which I fed by gazing ince&s;&s;antly on the delightful object. Dinner was &s;carce ended, when the &s;quire became very drow&s;y, and, after &s;everal dreadful yawns, got up, &s;tretched him&s;elf, took two or three turns acro&s;s the room, begged we would allow him to take a &s;hort nap, and, having laid a &s;trong injunction on his &s;i&s;ter to detain us till his return, went to his repo&s;e without any farther ceremony. He had not been gone many minutes when Freeman, gue&s;&s;ing the &s;ituation of my heart, and thinking he could not do me a greater fa|vour than to leave me alone with Narci&s;&s;a, pretended to recollect him&s;elf all of a &s;udden, and, &s;tarting up, begged the lady's pardon for half an hour, having luckily re|membered an engagement of &s;ome con&s;equence that he mu&s;t perform at that in&s;tant. So &s;aying, he took his leave, promi&s;ing to come back time enough for tea, leaving my mi&s;tre&s;s and me in great confu&s;ion. Now that I en|joyed an opportunity of di&s;clo&s;ing the pantings of my &s;oul, I had not power to u&s;e it. I &s;tudied many pathetic de|clarations, but, when I attempted to give them utterance, my tongue denied its office, and &s;he &s;at &s;ilent, with a down|ca&s;t look, full of anxious alarm, her bo&s;om heaving with expectation of &s;ome great event. At length I endeavoured to put an end to this &s;olemn pau&s;e, and began with, <Q>It is very &s;urpri&s;ing, Madam</Q>&mdash;Here, the &s;ound dying away, I made a full &s;top&mdash;while Narci&s;&s;a, &s;tarting, blu&s;h|ed, and with a timid accent, an&s;wered, "Sir?"

Since the happy occa&s;ion of being alone with you pre|&s;ented it&s;elf, I have made many un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to declare a pa&s;&s;ion for the lovelie&s;t of her &s;ex&mdash;a pa&s;|&s;ion which took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul when my cruel fate compelled me to wear a &s;ervile di&s;gui&s;e &s;o un&s;uit|able to my birth, &s;entiments, and, let me add, my de|&s;erts; yet favourable in one re&s;pect, as it furni&s;hed me with opportunities of &s;eeing and adoring your perfec|tions&mdash;Yes, Madam, it was then your dear idea entered my bo&s;om, where it has lived unimpaired in the mid&s;t of numberle&s;s cares, and animated me again&s;t a thou&s;and dangers and calamities!</Q> While I &s;poke thus, &s;he con|cealed her face with her fan, and when I cea&s;ed, recover|ing her&s;elf from the mo&s;t beautiful confu&s;ion, told me that &s;he thought her&s;elf very much obliged by my favourable opinion of her, and that &s;he was very &s;orry to hear I had been unfortunate. Encouraged by this gentle reply, I proceeded to own my&s;elf &s;ufficiently recompen&s;ed by her kind compa&s;&s;ion for what I had undergone, and declared, that the future happine&s;s of my life depended &s;olely upon her. "Sir," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>I &s;hould be very ungrateful if, after the &s;ignal protection you once afforded me, I &s;hould refu&s;e to contribute towards your happine&s;s in any rea&s;onable conde&s;cen&s;ion.</Q> Tran&s;ported at this ac|knowledgment, I threw my&s;elf at her feet, and begged &s;he would regard my pa&s;&s;ion with a favourable eye: &s;he was alarmed at my behaviour, entreated me to ri&s;e, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t her brother &s;hould di&s;cover me in that po&s;ture, and to &s;pare her, for the pre&s;ent, upon a &s;ubject for which &s;he was al|together unprepared: upon this, I ro&s;e, a&s;&s;uring her I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould rather die than di&s;obey her, but in the mean time begged her to con&s;ider how precious the minutes of this opportunity were, and what re&s;traint I put upon my in|clination

She &s;miled with un&s;peakable &s;weetne&s;s, and &s;aid, there would be no want of opportunities, provided I could maintain the good opi|nion her brother had conceived of me; and I, enchanted by her charms, &s;eized her hand, which I well nigh de|voured with ki&s;&s;es. But &s;he checked my boldne&s;s with a &s;everity of countenance, and de&s;ired I would not &s;o far for|get my&s;elf or her as to endanger the e&s;teem &s;he had for me&mdash;&s;he reminded me of our being almo&s;t &s;trangers to each other, and of the nece&s;&s;ity there was for her knowing me better, before &s;he could take any re&s;olution in my &s;a|vour, and, in &s;hort, mingled &s;o much good &s;en&s;e and com|placency in her reproof, that I became as much enamoured of her under&s;tanding as I had been before of her beauty, and a&s;ked pardon for my pre&s;umption with the utmo&s;t re|verence of conviction. She forgave my offence with her u&s;ual affability, and &s;ealed my pardon with a look &s;o full of bewitching tenderne&s;s, that for &s;ome minutes my &s;en&s;es were lo&s;t in exta&s;y! Lafterwards endeavoured to regulate my behaviour according to her de&s;ire, and turn the con|ver&s;ation upon a more indifferent &s;ubject; but her pre&s;ence was an un&s;urmountable ob&s;tacle to my de&s;ign; while I be|held &s;o much excellence, I &s;ound it impo&s;&s;ible to call my attention from the contemplation of it. I gazed with un|utterable fondne&s;s! I grew mad with admiration!&mdash;<Q>My condition is in&s;upportable,</Q> cried I; <Q>I am di&s;tract|ed with pa&s;&s;ion!&mdash;Why are you &s;o exqui&s;itely fair? Why are you &s;o enchantingly good? Why has nature dignified you with charms &s;o much above the &s;tandard of women? and, wretch that I am, how dares my unwor|thine&s;s a&s;pire to the enjoyment of &s;uch perfection!</Q></P>
<P>She was &s;tartled at my ravings, rea&s;oned down my tran&s;|port, and, by her irre&s;i&s;tible eloquence, &s;oothed my &s;oul into a &s;tate of tranquil felicity; but, le&s;t I might &s;uffer a relap&s;e, indu&s;triou&s;ly promoted other &s;ubjects to entertain my imagination. She chid me for having omitted to in|quire about her aunt, who, &s;he a&s;&s;ured me, in the mid&s;t of all her ab&s;ence of temper, and detachment from common affairs, often talked of me with uncommon warmth. I profe&s;&s;ed my veneration for the good lady, excu&s;ed my omi&s;&s;ion by imputing it to the violence of my love, which engro&s;&s;ed my whole &s;oul, and de&s;ired to know the pre&s;ent

vi&s;it her aunt, and, when Freeman and I propo&s;ed to take our leave, the fox-hunter in&s;i&s;ted on our &s;pending the even|ing at his hou&s;e with &s;uch an ob&s;tinacy of affection, that we were obliged to comply. For my own part, I &s;hould have been glad of the invitation, by which, in all likeli|hood, I &s;hould have been ble&s;t with more of his &s;i&s;ter's company, had I not been afraid of ri&s;king her e&s;teem by entering into a debauch of drinking with him, which, from the knowledge of his character, I fore&s;aw would happen; but there was no remedy&mdash;I was forced to rely upon the &s;trength of my con&s;titution, which I hoped would re&s;i&s;t intoxication longer than the &s;quire's, and tru&s;t to the good nature and di&s;cretion of my mi&s;tre&s;s for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Our entertainer, re&s;olving to begin by times, ordered the table to be furni&s;hed with liquor and gla&s;&s;es immedi|ately after tea; but we ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to &s;et in for drinking &s;o &s;oon, and we prevailed upon him to pa&s;s away an hour or two at whi&s;t, in which he engaged as &s;oon as Narci&s;&s;a returned. The &s;avage and I happened to be part|ners at fir&s;t, and, as my thoughts were wholly employed on a more intere&s;ting game, I played &s;o ill, that he lo&s;t all patience, &s;wore bitterly, and threatened to call for wine, if they would not grant him another a&s;&s;ociate. This de&s;ire was gratified, and Narci&s;&s;a and I were of a &s;ide; he won for the &s;ame rea&s;on that made him lo&s;e before; I was &s;atisfied, my lovely partner did not repine, and the time &s;lipped away very agreeably, until we were told that &s;upper was &s;erved in another room.</P>
<P>The &s;quire was enraged to find the evening &s;o unpro|fitably &s;pent, and wreaked his vengeance on the cards, which he tore, and committed to the flames with many execrations; threatening to make us redeem our lo&s;s with a large gla&s;s and quick circulation! and indeed we had no &s;ooner &s;upped, and my charmer withdrawn, than he began to out his threats in execution. Three bottles of port (for he drank no other &s;ort of wine) were placed be|fore us, with as many water-gla&s;&s;es, which were immedi|ately filled to the brim, after his example, by each out of his re&s;pective allowance, and emptied in a trice, <HI>to the be&s;t in Chri&s;tendom.</HI>&mdash;Though I &s;wallowed this, and the next as fa&s;t as the gla&s;s could be repleni&s;hed, without he&s;ita|tion or &s;hew of reluctance, I perceived that my brain would

not be able to bear many bumpers of this &s;ort; and dread|ing the per&s;everance of a champion who began with &s;uch vigour, I determined to make up for the deficiency of my &s;trength by a &s;tratagem, which I actually put in practice when the &s;econd cour&s;e of bottles was called for.&mdash;The wine being &s;trong and heady, I was already a good deal di&s;compo&s;ed by the di&s;patch we had made; Freeman's eyes began to reel, and Bruin him&s;elf was elevated into a &s;ong, which he uttered with great vociferation. When I therefore &s;aw the &s;econd round brought in, I a&s;&s;umed a gay air, entertained him with a French catch on the &s;ubject of drinking, which, though he did not under&s;tand, delighted him highly, and, telling him that your choice &s;pirits at Paris never troubled them|&s;elves with gla&s;&s;es, a&s;ked if he had not a bowl or cup in the hou&s;e that would contain a whole quart of wine.&mdash;"Odds niggers!" cried he, <Q>I have a &s;ilver caudle|cup that holds ju&s;t the quantity, for all the world&mdash;fetch it hither, Numps.</Q>&mdash;The ve&s;&s;el being produced, I bid him decant his bottle into it, which having done, I nodded in a very deliberate manner, and &s;aid, <Q>I pledge you.</Q>&mdash;He &s;tared at me for &s;ome time, and crying, "What, all at one pull!

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I WAS met next morning at the u&s;ual place by Mi&s;s Williams, who gave me joy of the progre&s;s I had made in the affection of her mi&s;tre&s;s, and ble&s;&s;ed me with an ac|count of that dear creature's conver&s;ation with her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he had retired the night before from our company <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could &s;carce believe her information, when &s;he recounted her expre&s;&s;ions in my favour, &s;o much more warm and pa&s;&s;ionate were they than my mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes had pre&s;aged; and was particularly plea&s;ed to hear that &s;he approved of my behaviour to her brother, after &s;he with|drew. Tran&s;ported at the news of my happine&s;s, I pre&s;ented my ring to the me&s;&s;enger, as a te&s;timony of my gratitude and &s;atisfaction; but &s;he was above &s;uch merce|nary con&s;iderations, and refu&s;ed my compliment with &s;ome re&s;entment, &s;aying, &s;he was not a little mortified to &s;ee my opinion of her &s;o low and contemptible.&mdash;I did my&s;elf a piece of ju&s;tice by explaining my behaviour on this head, and to convince her of my e&s;teem, promi&s;ed to be ruled by her directions in the pro&s;ecution of the whole affair, which I had &s;o much at heart, that the repo&s;e of my life depended upon the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>As I fervently wi&s;hed for another interview, where I might pour out the effu&s;ions of my love, without danger of being interrupted, and perhaps reap &s;ome endearing return from the queen of my de&s;ires, I implored her ad|vice
<PB N="159" REF="027715_0400_0FD5EEA2106109F8">
and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in promoting this event; but &s;he gave me to under&s;tand, that Narci&s;&s;a would make no precipi|tate compliances of this kind, and that I would do well to cultivate her brother's acquaintance, in the cour&s;e of which I would not want opportunities of removing that re&s;erve; which my mi&s;tre&s;s thought her&s;elf obliged to maintain during the infancy of our corre&s;pondence.&mdash;In the mean time, &s;he promi&s;ed to tell her lady, that I had endeavoured by pre&s;ents and per&s;ua&s;ions, to prevail upon her (Mi&s;s Williams) to deliver a letter from me, which &s;he had refu&s;ed to charge her&s;elf with, until &s;he &s;hould know Narci&s;&s;a's &s;entiments of the matter; and &s;aid, by the&s;e means &s;he did not doubt of being able to open a li|terary communication between us, which could not fail of introducing more intimate connections.</P>
<P>I approved of her council, and our appointment being renewed for next day, left her with an intent of falling upon &s;ome method of being reconciled to the &s;quire, who, I &s;uppo&s;ed, would be offended with the trick we had put upon him.&mdash;With this view, I con&s;ulted Freeman, who, from his knowledge of the fox-hunter's di&s;po&s;ition, a&s;&s;ured me there was no other method of pacifying him, than that of &s;acrificing our&s;elves for one night, to an equal match with him in drinking: this I found my&s;elf nece&s;|&s;iated to comply with, for the intere&s;t of my pa&s;&s;ion, and therefore determined to commit the debauch at my own lodgings, that I might run no ri&s;k of being di&s;covered by Narci&s;&s;a, in a &s;tate of brutal degeneracy.&mdash;Mr. Freeman, who was to be of the party, went, at my de&s;ire, to the &s;quire in order to engage him, while I took care to fur|ni&s;h my&s;elf for his reception.&mdash;My invitation was accept|ed, my gue&s;ts honoured me with their company in the evening, when Bruin gave me to under&s;tand that he had dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> many tuns of wine in his life, but was never &s;erved &s;uch a trick as I had played upon him the night before. I promi&s;ed to atone for my tre&s;pa&s;s, and having ordered to every man his bottle, began the conte&s;t with a bumper to the health of Narci&s;&s;a.&mdash;The toa&s;ts circulated with great devotion, the liquor began to operate, our mirth grew noi&s;y, and as Freeman and I had the advantage of drinking &s;mall French claret, the &s;avage was effectually

tamed, before our &s;en&s;es were in the lea&s;t affected, and carried home in an apoplexy of drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>I was next morning, as u&s;ual, favoured with a vi&s;it from my kind and punctual confidante, who telling me, &s;he was permitted to receive my letters for her mi&s;tre&s;s, I took up the pen immediately, and following the fir&s;t dic|tates of my pa&s;&s;ion, wrote as follows:</P>

felt before!

<P>I informed my friend of the &s;quire's con&s;ent, with re|gard to my dancing with Narci&s;&s;a at the ball, and de&s;ired her to tell her mi&s;tre&s;s, that I would do my&s;elf the honour of vi&s;iting her in the afternoon, in con&s;equence of his per|mi&s;&s;ion, when I hoped to find her as indulgent as her bro|ther had been complai&s;ant in that particular.&mdash;Mi&s;s Wil|liams expre&s;&s;ed a good deal of joy, at hearing I was &s;o much in favour with the fox-hunter, and ventured to a&s;|&s;ure me, that my vi&s;it would be very agreeable to my mi|&s;tre&s;s, the rather becau&s;e Bruin was engaged to dine abroad.

<P>Every thing &s;ucceeding thus to my wi&s;h, I waited with incredible impatience for the time, which no &s;ooner arrived, than I ha&s;tened to the &s;cene, which my fancy had pre-oc|cupied long before.

While we were &s;ubject to be in|terrupted or overheard, we conver&s;ed about the approach|ing ball, at which &s;he promi&s;ed to grace me as a partner; but when the equipage was removed, and we were left alone, I re&s;umed the more intere&s;ting theme, and expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with &s;uch tran&s;port and agitation, that my mi&s;tre&s;s, fearing I would commit &s;ome extravagance, rung the bell for her maid, whom &s;he detained in the room, as a check upon my vivacity.&mdash;I was not &s;orry for this precaution, becau&s;e I could unbo&s;om my&s;elf without re&s;erve, before Mi&s;s Williams, who was the confidante of us both.&mdash;I therefore gave a loo&s;e to the in&s;pirations of my pa&s;&s;ion, which operated &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully upon the tender affections of Narci&s;&s;a, that &s;he laid a&s;ide the con&s;traint &s;he had hitherto wore, and ble&s;&s;ed me with the mo&s;t melting declaration of her mutual flame!&mdash;It was impo&s;&s;ible for me to forbear taking the advantage of this endearing conde&s;cen&s;ion.&mdash;She now gently yielded to my embrace, while I, encir|cling all that I held dear within my arms, ta&s;ted, in ad|vance, the joys of that paradi&s;e I hoped, in a little time, wholly to po&s;&s;e&s;s!&mdash;We &s;pent the afternoon in all the exta&s;y of hope that the mo&s;t fervent love, exchanged by mutual vows, could in&s;pire; and Mi&s;s Williams was &s;o much affected with our cha&s;te care&s;&s;es, which recalled the &s;ad remembrance of what &s;he was, that her eyes were filled with tears.</P>
<P>The evening being pretty far advanced, I forced my&s;elf from the dear object of my flame, who indulged me in a tender embrace at parting; and, repairing to my lodgings, communicated to my friend Strap every circum&s;tance of my happine&s;s, which filled him with &s;o much plea&s;ure, that it ran over at his eyes, and he prayed heartily, that no envious devil might, as formerly, da&s;h the cup of ble&s;|&s;ing from my lip.

fortune of one whom &s;he had favoured with her affection, and I began to be a little anxious about the &s;ituation of her finances, well knowing, that I &s;hould do an irrepar|able injury to the per&s;on my &s;oul held mo&s;t dear, if I &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e her without being able to &s;upport her in the rank which was certainly her due. I had heard, in|deed, while I &s;erved her aunt, that her father had left her a con&s;iderable &s;um, and that every body believed &s;he would inherit the greate&s;t part of her kin&s;woman's dowry; but I did not know how far &s;he might be re&s;tricted by the old gentleman's will, in the enjoyment of what he left her, and I was too well informed of the virtuo&s;o's late conduct, to think my mi&s;tre&s;s could have any expectations from that quarter. I confided, however, in the good &s;en&s;e and po|licy of my charmer, who, I was &s;ure, would not con&s;ent to unite her fate with mine, before &s;he had fully con&s;idered and provided for the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The ball-night being arrived, I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in a &s;uit I had re&s;erved for &s;ome grand occa&s;ion, and, having drank tea with Narci&s;&s;a and her brother, conducted my angel to the &s;cene, where &s;he in a moment eclip&s;ed all her female competitors for beauty, and attracted the admiration of the whole a&s;&s;embly. My heart dilated with pride on this occa&s;ion, and my triumph rejected all bounds, when, after we had danced together, a certain nobleman, remarkable for his figure and influence in the <HI>beau monde,</HI> came up, and, in the hearing of all pre&s;ent, honoured us with a very particular compliment upon our accompli&s;hments and appearance&mdash;but this tran&s;port was &s;oon checked, when I perceived his lord&s;hip attach him&s;elf with great a&s;&s;iduity to my mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ay &s;ome warm things, which I thought &s;avoured too much of pa&s;&s;ion.

Narci&s;&s;a, &s;u&s;pecting nothing of the rage that inflamed me, put &s;ome que&s;tions to me as &s;oon as he was gone, to which I made no reply, but a&s;&s;umed a grim look, which too well denoted the agitation of my brea&s;t, and

&s;urpri&s;ed her not a little. She no &s;ooner ob&s;erved my emo|tion than &s;he changed colour, and a&s;ked what ailed me? but, before I could make an an&s;wer, her brother, pulling me by the &s;leeve, bid me take notice of a lady who &s;at fronting us, whom I immediately, to my va&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, di&s;tingui&s;hed to be Melinda, accompanied by her mother, and an elderly gentleman whom I did not know.&mdash;"Wound! Mr. Randan," cried the &s;quire, <Q>is &s;he not a delicate piece of &s;tuff!&mdash;'Sdeath! I have a good mind&mdash;if I thought &s;he was a &s;ingle per&s;on.</Q>&mdash;Notwith|&s;tanding the perplexity I was in, I had reflection enough to fore&s;ee, that my pa&s;&s;ion might &s;uffer greatly by the pre|&s;ence of this lady, who in all probability would revenge her&s;elf upon me for having formerly di&s;graced her, by &s;preading reports to my prejudice. I was therefore alarm|ed at the&s;e &s;ymptoms of the &s;quire's admiration, and for &s;ome time did not know what reply to make, when he a&s;ked my opinion of her beauty. At length I came to a determination, and told him that her name was Melinda, that &s;he had a fortune of ten thou&s;and pounds, and was &s;aid to be under promi&s;e of marriage to a certain lord, who deferred his nuptials until he &s;hould be of age, which would happen in a few months. I thought this piece of intelligence, which I had my&s;elf invented, would have hindered him effectually from entertaining any farther thoughts of her; but I was egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken; the fox|hunter had too much &s;elf-&s;ufficiency to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t any competitor on earth: he therefore made light of her engagement, &s;aying with a &s;mile of &s;elf approbation, <Q>Mayhap &s;he will change her mind&mdash;what &s;ignifies his being a lord?&mdash;I think my&s;elf as good a man as e'er a lord in Chri&s;tendom, and I'll &s;ee if a commoner worth three thou&s;and a-year won't &s;erve her turn.</Q> This de|termination &s;tartled me not a little; I knew he would &s;oon di&s;cover the contrary of what I advanced, and, as I be|lieved he would find her ear open to his addre&s;&s;es, did not doubt of meeting with every ob&s;tacle in my amour, that her malice could invent, and her influence with him exe|cute.

<P>HAVING uttered this exclamation, at which &s;he &s;ighed. I went home in the condition of a frantic bedlamite, and, finding the fire in my apartment almo&s;t extingui&s;hed, vented my fury upon poor Strap, who&s;e ear I pinched with &s;uch violence, that he roared hideou&s;ly with pain, and, when I quitted my hold, looked &s;o fooli&s;hly agha&s;t, that no unconcerned &s;pectator could have &s;een him without being &s;eized with an immoderate fit of laughter. It is true, I was &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of the injury I had done, and a&s;ked pardon for the outrage I had committed; upon which my faithful valet, &s;haking his head, &s;aid, <Q>I for|give you, and may God forgive you.</Q>&mdash;But he could not help &s;hedding &s;ome tears at my unkindne&s;s. I felt un&s;peakable remor&s;e for what I had done, cur&s;ed my own ingratitude, and con&s;idered his tears as a reproach that my &s;oul, in her pre&s;ent di&s;turbance, could not bear.&mdash;It

&s;et all my pa&s;&s;ions into a ferment; I &s;wore horrible oaths without meaning or application; I foamed at the mouth, kicked the chairs about the room, and played abundance of mad pranks that frightened my friend almo&s;t out of his &s;en&s;es.&mdash;At length my tran&s;port &s;ub&s;ided, I became melan|choly, and wept in&s;en&s;ibly.</P>
<P>During this &s;tate of dejectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, I was &s;urpri&s;ed with the appearance of Mi&s;s Williams, whom Strap, blubbering all the while, had conducted into the chamber, without giving me previous notice of her approach.&mdash;She was ex|tremely affected with my condition, which &s;he had learned from him, begged me to moderate my pa&s;&s;ion, &s;u&s;pend my conjectures, and follow her to Narci&s;&s;a, who de&s;ired to &s;ee me forthwith.&mdash;That dear name operated upon me like a charm! I &s;tarted up, and, without opening my lips, was conducted into her apartment, through the garden, which we entered by a private door.&mdash;I found the ador|able creature in tears! I was melted at the &s;ight&mdash;we con|tinued &s;ilent for &s;ome time&mdash;my heart was too full to &s;peak&mdash;her &s;nowy bo&s;om heaved with fond re&s;entment; at la&s;t &s;he &s;obbing, cried <Q>what have I done to di&s;oblige you!</Q> My heart was pierced with the tender que&s;tion! I drew near with the utmo&s;t reverence of affection! I fell upon my knees before her, and ki&s;&s;ing her hand, exclaim|ed, <Q>O! thou art all goodne&s;s and perfection! I am un|done by my want of merit! I am unworthy to po&s;&s;e&s;s thy charms, which heaven hath de&s;tined for the arms of &s;ome more favoured being.</Q> She gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e of my di&s;quiet, upbraided me gently for my &s;u&s;picion, and gave me &s;uch flattering a&s;&s;urances of her eternal fidelity, that all my doubts and fears for&s;ook me, and peace and &s;atisfaction reigned within my brea&s;t.</P>
<P>At midnight I left the kind nymph to her repo&s;e, and being let out by Mi&s;s Williams at the garden gate, by which I entered, began, to explore my way homeward in the dark, when I heard at my back a noi&s;e like that of a baboon when he mows and chatters. I turned in&s;tantly&punc; and, perceiving &s;omething black, concluded I was di&s;co|vered by &s;ome &s;py, employed to watch for that purpo&s;e. Arou&s;ed at this conjecture, by which the reputation of the virtuous Narci&s;&s;a appeared in jeopardy, I drew my &s;word, and would have &s;acrificed him to her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame, had not the

Upon which he gave me to under&s;tand, that his concern for me had induced him to follow me to that place, where the &s;ame rea&s;on had detained him till now, and he frankly owned, that, in &s;pite of the e&s;teem he had for Mi&s;s Wil|liams, he began to be very unea&s;y about me, con&s;idering the di&s;po&s;ition in which I went abroad, and, if I had &s;taid much longer, would have certainly alarmed the neigh|bourhood in my behalf. The knowledge of this his inten|tion confounded me! I repre&s;ented to him the mi&s;chievious con&s;equences that would have attended &s;uch a ra&s;h action, and, cautioning him &s;everely again&s;t any &s;uch de&s;ign for the future, concluded my admonition with an a&s;&s;urance, that, in ca&s;e he &s;hould ever act &s;o madly, I would, with|out he&s;itation, put him to death.&mdash;<Q>Have a little pa|tience,</Q> cried he in a lamentable tone; <Q>your di&s;plea|&s;ure will do the bu&s;ine&s;s, without your committing murder.</Q> I was touched with this reproach, and, as &s;oon as we got home, made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to appea&s;e him by explaining the cau&s;e of that tran&s;port, during which I had u&s;ed him &s;o unworthily.</P>
<P>Next day, when I went into the Long-room, I ob&s;er|ved &s;everal whi&s;pers circulate all of a &s;udden, and did not doubt that Melinda had been bu&s;y with my character; but I con&s;oled my&s;elf with the love of Narci&s;&s;a, upon which I re&s;ted with the mo&s;t perfect confidence, and, going up to the rowly-powly table, won a few pieces from my &s;u&s;pected rival, who with an ea&s;y politene&s;s entered into conver&s;ation with me, and, de&s;iring my company at the coffee-hou&s;e, treated me with tea and chocolate. I remem|bered Strutwell, and guarded again&s;t his in&s;inuating be|haviour; nor was my &s;u&s;picion wrong placed; he artfully turned the di&s;cour&s;e upon Narci&s;&s;a, and endeavoured, by hinting at an intrigue he pretended to be engaged in el&s;e|where, to learn what connection there was between her and me. But all his fine&s;&s;e was ineffectual; I was con|vinced of his di&s;&s;imulation, and gave &s;uch general an&s;wers
<PB N="169" REF="027715_0410_0FD5EEB4D2E09C70">
to his enquiries, that he was forced to drop the &s;ubject, and talk of &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>While we conver&s;ed in this manner, the &s;avage came in with another gentleman, who introduced him to his lord|&s;hip; and he was received with &s;uch peculiar marks of di&s;tinction, that I was per&s;uaded that the courtier intend|ed to u&s;e him in &s;ome &s;hape or other, and thence I con|ceived an unlucky omen. But I had more cau&s;e to be di&s;mayed the following day, when I &s;aw the &s;quire in company with Melinda and her mother, who honoured me with &s;everal di&s;dainful glances; and when I afterwards threw my&s;elf in his way, in&s;tead of the cordial &s;hake of the hand, he returned my &s;alute with the cold reception of <Q>Ser|vant, &s;ervant,</Q> which he pronounced with &s;uch indif|ference, or rather contempt, that, if he had not been Narci&s;&s;a's brother, I &s;hould have affronted him in public.</P>
<P>The&s;e occurrences di&s;turbed me not a little; I fore&s;aw the brooding &s;torm, and armed my&s;elf with re&s;olution for the occa&s;ion; but, Narci&s;&s;a being at &s;take, I was far from being re&s;igned. I could have renounced every other com|fort of life with &s;ome degree of fortitude; but the pro&s;pect of lo&s;ing her, di&s;abled all my philo&s;ophy, and tortured my &s;oul into madne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Williams found me next morning full of anxious tumult, which did not abate when &s;he told me, that my Lord Quiverwit, having profe&s;&s;ed honourable intentions, had been introduced to my lovely mi&s;tre&s;s by her brother, who had at the &s;ame time, from the information of Me|linda, &s;poke of me as an Iri&s;h fortune-hunter, without either birth or e&s;tate to recommend me, who &s;upported my&s;elf in the appearance of a gentleman by &s;harping and other infamous practices, and who was of &s;uch an ob&s;cure origin, that I did not even know my own extraction.&mdash;Though I expected all this, I could not hear it with tem|per, e&s;pecially as truth was &s;o blended with fal&s;hood in the a&s;&s;ertion, that it would be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to &s;epa|rate the one from the other in my vindication. But I &s;aid nothing on this head, being impatient to know how Nar|ci&s;&s;a had been affected with the di&s;covery. The generous creature, far from believing the&s;e imputations, was no &s;ooner withdrawn with her confidante than &s;he inveighed with great warmth again&s;t the malevolence of the world,

to which only &s;he a&s;cribed the whole of what had been &s;aid to my di&s;advantage, and, calling every circum&s;tance of my behaviour to her, into review before her, found every thing &s;o polite, honourable, and di&s;intere&s;ted, that &s;he could not harbour the lea&s;t doubt of my being the gen|tleman I a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">med.

<P>As I did not doubt that, by this time, the &s;candalous a&s;per&s;ions of Melinda were diffu&s;ed all over the town, I re|&s;olved to recollect my whole &s;trength of a&s;&s;urance to brow|beat the effor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of her malice, and to publi&s;h her adventure with the Frenchified barber by way of repri&s;al.

Her admirer, who&s;e courage never ro&s;e but in proportion to the wine he had &s;wallowed, in&s;tead of re&s;enting my addre&s;s in what is called an honourable way, threatened to pro&s;ecute me for an a&s;&s;ault, and took witne&s;&s;es accordingly, while &s;he, piqued at his pu&s;illanimous behaviour, and enraged at the &s;arca&s;m I had uttered again&s;t her, endeavoured to make her quar|rel a public cau&s;e, and wept aloud with &s;pite and vexation. The tears of a lady could not fail of attracting the notice and concern of the &s;pectators, to whom &s;he complained of my rudene&s;s with great bitterne&s;s, &s;aying, if &s;he was a man I dur&s;t not u&s;e her &s;o. The greate&s;t part of the gen|tlemen, already prejudiced again&s;t me, were offended at the liberty I had taken, as appeared from their looks, though none of them &s;ignified their di&s;gu&s;t any other way, except my Lord Quiverwit, who ventured to &s;ay with a &s;neer, that I was in the right to e&s;tabli&s;h my own charac|ter, of which he had now no longer any doubt. Nettled at this &s;evere <HI>equivoque,</HI> which rai&s;ed a laugh at my ex|pence, I replied with &s;ome warmth, <Q>I am proud of having in that particular got the &s;tart of your lord&s;hip.</Q> He made no an&s;wer to my repartee, but, with a con|temptuous &s;mile, walked off, leaving me in a very di&s;a|greeable &s;ituation. In vain did I make up to &s;everal peo|ple of my acquaintance, who&s;e conver&s;ation, I hoped, would bani&s;h my confu&s;ion; every body &s;hunned me like a per&s;on infected, and I &s;hould not have been able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear my di&s;grace, had not the idea of the ever faithful and fond Narci&s;&s;a come to my relief. I quitted the &s;cene of my mortification, and, &s;auntering about the town, happened to wake from my contemplation, when I found my&s;elf
<PB N="173" REF="027715_0414_0FD5EEB98A082168">
ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to a toy-&s;hop, which I entered, and purcha|&s;ed a ring &s;et with a ruby in the form of a heart, &s;urround|ed by diamond &s;parks, for which I paid ten guineas, in|tending it for a pre&s;ent to the charmer of my &s;oul.</P>
<P>I was introduced, at the hour appointed, to this divine creature, who, notwith&s;tanding what &s;he had heard to my di&s;advantage, received me with the utmo&s;t confidence and tenderne&s;s, and, having been informed of the general &s;ketches of my life by Mi&s;s Williams, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of knowing the particular circum&s;tances, which I related with great candour, omitting, however, &s;ome things which I concluded altogether improper for her ear, and which the reader's reflection will ea&s;ily &s;ugge&s;t. As my &s;tory was little el&s;e than a recital of misfortunes, the tear of &s;ympa|thy cea&s;ed not to trickle from her enchanting eyes during the whole of the narration, which, when I had fini&s;hed, &s;he recompen&s;ed me for my trouble with the mo&s;t endearing prote&s;tations of eternal love. She bewailed her re&s;tricted condition, as it was the means of retarding my happine&s;s; told me&punc; that Lord Quiverwit, by her brother's permi&s;|&s;ion, had been to drink tea with her that very afternoon, and actually propo&s;ed marriage; and, &s;eeing me extremely affected with this piece of information, offered to give me a convincing proof of her affection by e&s;pou&s;ing me in pri|vate, and leaving the re&s;t to fate. I was penetrated with this in&s;tance of her regard, but, that I might not be out|done in genero&s;ity, re&s;i&s;ted the bewitching temptation, in con&s;ideration of her honour and intere&s;t; at the &s;ame time pre&s;ented my ring as a pledge of my inviolable attach|ment, and on my knees implored Heaven to &s;hower its cur&s;es on my head, if ever my heart &s;hould entertain one thought unworthy of the pa&s;&s;ion I then avowed. She re|ceived my token, gave me in return her picture &s;et in minia|ture, exqui&s;itely drawn, and &s;et in gold, and in the &s;ame po&s;ture called Heaven to witne&s;s, and to judge her flame. Our vows thus reciprocally breathed, a confidence of hope en&s;ued, and, our mutual fondne&s;s becoming as intimate as innocence would allow, I grew in&s;en&s;ible of the progre&s;s of time, and it was morning before I could tear my&s;elf from this darling of my &s;oul!

<ARGUMENT>
<P>I am vi&s;ited by Freeman, with whom I appear in public, and am care&s;&s;ed&mdash;am &s;ent for by Lord Quiverwit, who&s;e pre&s;ence I quit in a pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;Narci&s;&s;a is carried off by her brother&mdash;I intend to pur&s;ue him, and am di&s;&s;uaded by my friend&mdash;engage in play, and lo&s;e all my money&mdash;&s;et out for London&mdash;try my fortune at the gaming-table without &s;uc|ce&s;s&mdash;receive a letter from Narci&s;&s;a&mdash;bilk my taylor.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE I entertained my&s;elf with the&s;e reflections, the news of the duel being communicated by &s;ome unknown channel, &s;pread all over the town.&mdash;I was vi&s;it|ed by Freeman, who te&s;tified his &s;urpri&s;e at finding me, having been told, that Lord Quiverwit being dead of his wounds, I had ab&s;conded, in order to avoid the cogni|zance of the law. I a&s;ked if people gue&s;&s;ed the occa&s;ion of the quarrel; and under&s;tanding it was attributed to his Lord&s;hip's re&s;entment of my reply in the Long-room, confirmed that conjecture, glad to find Narci&s;&s;a un&s;u&s;pect|ed.&mdash;My friend, after I had a&s;&s;ured him that my antago|ni&s;t was in no danger, wi&s;hed me joy of the event, than which, he &s;aid, nothing could happen more opportunely to &s;upport the idea he had given of my character to his friends, among whom he had been very a&s;&s;iduous in my behalf.</P>
<P>On the &s;trength of this a&s;&s;urance, I went with him to the coffee-hou&s;e, where I was &s;aluted by a great many of tho&s;e very per&s;ons who &s;hunned me the preceding day.&mdash;
<PB N="178" REF="027715_0419_0FD5EEC46DC83AE8">
And I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound every body making merry with the &s;tory of Melinda's French gallant.&mdash;While I remained in this place, I received a me&s;&s;age from Lord Quiverwit, de&s;iring, if I was not engaged, to &s;ee him at his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Thither I immediately repaired, and was conducted to an apartment, where I was received by his Lord&s;hip in bed. Being left by our&s;elves, he thanked me in very po|lite terms, for having u&s;ed the advantage fortune had given me over him, with &s;uch moderation; and a&s;ked par|don for any offence his re&s;entment might have prompted him to commit.&mdash;"I would willingly," &s;aid he, <Q>make you my friend; but as it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to dive&s;t my&s;elf of my pa&s;&s;ion for Narci&s;&s;a, I am too well convin|ced of your &s;entiments, to think we &s;hall ever agree on that &s;ubject. I took the liberty, therefore, of &s;ending for you, in order to own candidly, that I cannot help oppo&s;ing your &s;ucce&s;s with that young lady; though at the &s;ame time I promi&s;e to regulate my oppo&s;ition by the dictates of ju&s;tice and honour: this, however, I think proper to adverti&s;e you of, that &s;he has no inde|pendent fortune, and if you &s;hould even &s;ucceed in your addre&s;&s;es, you would have the mortification to &s;ee her reduced to indigence, unle&s;s you have wherewithal to &s;upport her&mdash;and I am credibly informed of your inca|pacity that way.&mdash;Nay, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that, urged by that con&s;ideration, I have actually &s;ent notice to her brother, of the progre&s;s I &s;u&s;pect you have made in her affection, and de&s;ired him to take his precautions ac|cordingly.</Q>&mdash;Alarmed and provoked at this informa|tion, I told his Lord&s;hip, that I did not &s;ee how he could reconcile that piece of conduct with his profe&s;&s;ion of open dealing, and flung away from him in a pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As I walked homeward, in hopes of hearing from my mi&s;tre&s;s as u&s;ual, by means of Mi&s;s Williams, I was &s;ur|pri&s;ed with the waving of a handkerchief, from the win|dow of a coach and &s;ix that pa&s;&s;ed by me at full &s;peed; and upon further ob&s;ervation, I &s;aw a &s;ervant on hor&s;e|back riding after it, who, I knew by his livery, belong|ed to the &s;quire.&mdash;Thunder&s;truck with this di&s;covery, the knowledge of my misfortune ru&s;hed all at once upon my reflection! I gue&s;&s;ed immediately that the &s;ignal was made by the dear hand of Narci&s;&s;a, who being hurried away in

con&s;equence of Lord Quiverwit's me&s;&s;age to her brother, had no other method of relating her di&s;tre&s;s, and implor|ing my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;Frantic with this conjecture, I ran to my lodgings, &s;natched my pi&s;tols, and ordered Strap to get po&s;t hor&s;es, with &s;uch incoherence of &s;peech and di&s;|order, that the poor valet, terrified with the &s;u&s;picion of another duel, in&s;tead of providing what I de&s;ired, went forthwith to Freeman, who being informed of my beha|viour came &s;traight to my apartment, and conjured me &s;o pathetically to acquaint him with the cau&s;e of my un|ea&s;ine&s;s, that I could not refu&s;e to tell him that my hap|pine&s;s was fled with Narci&s;&s;a, and that I mu&s;t retrieve her or peri&s;h. He repre&s;ented the madne&s;s of &s;uch an under|taking, and endeavoured to divert me from it, with great &s;trength of friend&s;hip and rea&s;on: but all his arguments would have been ineffectual, had he not put me in mind of the dependence I ought to have on the love of Narci&s;&s;a, and attachment of her maid, which could not fail of find|ing opportunities enough to adverti&s;e me of their &s;itua|tion; and, at the &s;ame time, demon&s;trated the injury my charmer's reputation mu&s;t &s;uffer from my precipitate re|treat. I was convinced and compo&s;ed by the&s;e con&s;idera|tions. I appeared in company with an air of tranquillity, was well received by the be&s;t company in town, and my misfortune taking air condoled accordingly; while I had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing Melinda &s;o univer&s;ally di&s;counte|nanced, that &s;he was fain to return to London, in order to avoid the &s;coffs and cen&s;ure of the ladies at Bath.&mdash;But though the hope of hearing from the darling of my &s;oul &s;upported my &s;pirits a little while, I began to be very un|ea&s;y, when, at the end of &s;everal weeks, I found that ex|pectation di&s;appointed.&mdash;In &s;hort, melancholy and de|&s;pondence took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul; and repining at that providence, which, by acting the &s;tep-mother towards me, kept me from the fruition of my wi&s;hes, I determin|ed, in a fit of de&s;pair, to ri&s;k all I had at the gaming-ta|ble, with a view of acquiring a fortune &s;ufficient to ren|der me independent for life; or of plunging my&s;elf into &s;uch a &s;tate of mi&s;ery, as would effectually cru&s;h every ambitious hope that now tortured my imagination.</P>
<P>Actuated by this fatal re&s;olution, I engaged in play, and, after &s;ome turns of fortune, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound my&s;elf at the end

of three days, worth a thou&s;and pounds; but it was not my intention to &s;top there, for which cau&s;e I kept Strap ignorant of my &s;ucce&s;s, and continued my career until I was reduced to five guineas, which I would have hazard|ed al&s;o, had I not been a&s;hamed to fall from a bett of two hundred pounds to &s;uch a petty &s;um.</P>
<P>Having thus executed my &s;cheme, I went home, amaz|ed to find my&s;elf &s;o much at ea&s;e, informed my friend Strap of my mi&s;chance, with &s;uch calmne&s;s, that he, ima|gining I joked, affected to receive the tidings with great equanimity.&mdash;But both he and I found our&s;elves mi&s;taken very &s;oon.&mdash;I had mi&s;interpreted my own &s;tupidity into deliberate re&s;ignation, and he had rea&s;on to believe me in earne&s;t, when he &s;aw me next morning agitated with the mo&s;t violent de&s;pair, which he endeavoured to alleviate with all the con&s;olation in his power.</P>
<P>In one of my lucid intervals, however, I charged him to take a place in the &s;tage-coach for London; and in the mean time paid my debts in Bath, which amounted to thirty-&s;hillings only.&mdash;Without taking leave of my friends, I embarked, Strap having the good fortune to find a return hor&s;e, and arrived in town without having met with any thing remarkable on the road, &s;ave that, while we cro&s;&s;ed Bag&s;hot heath, I was &s;eized with a &s;ort of inclination to retrieve my fortune, by laying pa&s;&s;engers under contribution, in &s;ome &s;uch place.&mdash;My thoughts were &s;o circum&s;tanced at this time, that I &s;hould have di|ge&s;ted the crime of robbery, &s;o righteou&s;ly had I concert|ed my plan&punc; and ventured my life in the execution, had I not been deterred by reflecting upon the infamy that at tends detection.</P>
<P>The apartment I formerly lived in being unengaged, I took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and next day went in que&s;t of Ban|ter, who received me with open arms, in expectation of having his bond di&s;charged to his liking: but when he under&s;tood what had happened, his countenance changed of a &s;udden, and he told me, with a dryne&s;s of di&s;plea&s;ure peculiar to him&s;elf, that if he was in my place he would put it out of fortune's power to play him &s;uch another trick, and be avenged of his own indi&s;cretion at once.&mdash;When I de&s;ired him to explain his meaning, he pointed to his neck, rai&s;ed him&s;elf on his tip-toes, and was going

away without further ceremony, when I put him in mind of my indigence, and demanded the five guineas I had formerly lent him.

<P>I returned to my lodgings full of de&s;perate re&s;olutions, and having made Strap acquainted with my fate, ordered him to pawn my &s;word immediately, that I might be enabled to make another effort.&mdash;This affectionate crea|ture no &s;ooner under&s;tood my purpo&s;e, than &s;eized with in&s;upportable &s;orrow at the pro&s;pect of my mi&s;ery, he bur&s;t into tears, and a&s;ked what I propo&s;ed to do after the &s;mall &s;um he could rai&s;e on the &s;word &s;hould be &s;pent: "On my own account," &s;aid he, <Q>I am quite uncon|cerned; for while God &s;pares me health and the&s;e ten fingers, I can earn a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence any where; but what mu&s;t become of you, who have le&s;s humility to &s;toop and more appetites to gratify?</Q>&mdash;Here I in|terrupted him by &s;aying, with a gloomy a&s;pect, I &s;hould never want a re&s;ource while I had a loaded pi&s;tol in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Stupified with horror at this dreadful in&s;inu|ation, he &s;tood mute for &s;ome time, then broke out into <Q>God of his infinite mercy enable you to with&s;tand that temptation of the devil!&mdash;Con&s;ider your immortal &s;oul!&mdash;there's no repentance in the grave!&mdash;O Lord, that ever it &s;hould come to this!&mdash;Are we not enjoined to re&s;ign our&s;elves to the will of Heaven? where is your pa|tience?

<P>This kind letter afforded me great con&s;olation: I com|municated it to Banter, and at the &s;ame time &s;hewed him her picture: he approved of her beauty and good &s;en&s;e, and could not help owning that my neglect of Mi&s;s Snapper was excu&s;able, when &s;uch a fine creature engro&s;&s;ed my attention.</P>
<P>I began to be reconciled to my fate, and imagined, that if I could contrive means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting until my un|cle &s;hould arrive, in ca&s;e he was not already at home, he would enable me to do &s;omething effectual in behalf of my love and fortune. I therefore con&s;ulted Banter about a pre&s;ent &s;upply, who no &s;ooner under&s;tood that I had credit with a taylor, than he advi&s;ed me to take off two or three &s;uits of rich clothes, and convert them into ca&s;h, by &s;elling them at half price to a &s;ale&s;man in Monmouth-&s;treet. I was &s;tartled at his propo&s;al, which I thought favoured a little of fraud; but he rendered it palatable by ob&s;erving that in a few months I might be in a condition to do every body ju&s;tice; and in the mean time I was ac|quitted by the hone&s;ty of my intention. I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be per&s;uaded by his &s;alvo, by which my nece&s;&s;ity rather than my judgment was convinced; and when I found there were no accounts of the &s;hip in which my uncle em|barked, actually put the &s;cheme in practice, and rai&s;ed by it five and twenty guineas, paying him for his advice with the odd five.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BUT this expedient was in a few weeks attended with a con&s;equence I did not fore&s;ee: a player having purcha&s;ed one of the &s;uits which were expo&s;ed to &s;ale, ap|peared in it on the &s;tage one night, while my taylor un|fortunately happened to be pre&s;ent.&mdash;He knew it immediately, and inquiring minutely into the affair, di&s;covered my whole contrivance: upon which he came to my lodg|ings, and telling me that he was very much &s;traitened for want of money, pre&s;ented his bill, which amounted to 50<HI>l.</HI>&mdash;Surpri&s;ed at this unexpected addre&s;s, I affected to treat him cavalierly, &s;wore &s;ome oaths, a&s;ked if he doubt|ed my honour, and telling him I &s;hould take care who I dealt with for the future, bid him come again in three days.&mdash;He obeyed me punctually, demanded his money, and finding him&s;elf amu&s;ed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">are promi&s;es, arre&s;ted me that very day in the &s;treet.&mdash;I was not much &s;hocked at this adventure, which, indeed, re&s;cued me from a hor|rible &s;u&s;pence in which I had lived &s;ince his fir&s;t vi&s;it. I refu&s;ed to go to a &s;punging-hou&s;e, where I had heard there was nothing but the mo&s;t flagrant impo&s;ition; and a coach being called, I was carried to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, at|tended by a bailiff and his follower, who were very much di&s;appointed and chagrined at my re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The turnkey gue&s;&s;ing from my appearance, that I had money in my pocket, received me with the repetition of the Latin word <HI>depone,</HI> and gave me to under&s;tand, that I mu&s;t pay before-hand for the apartment I &s;hould chu&s;e to dwell in.&mdash;I de&s;ired to &s;ee his conveniences, and hired a &s;mall paultry bed chamber, for a crown a week, which, in any other place, would not have let for half the money.&mdash;Having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this di&s;mal habitation, I

&s;ent for Strap, and my thoughts were bu&s;ied in collecting matter of con&s;olation to that faithful &s;quire, when &s;ome body knocked at my door, which I no &s;ooner opened, than a young fellow entered, in very &s;habby clothes and marvellous &s;oul linen. After a low bow, he called me by my name, and a&s;ked if I had forgot him. His voice a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in recollecting his per&s;on, which I &s;oon recog|nized to be my old acquaintance beau Jack&s;on, of whom mention is made in the fir&s;t part of my memoirs.&mdash;I &s;aluted him, expre&s;&s;ed my &s;atisfaction at finding him alive, and condoled with him on his pre&s;ent &s;ituation; which, how|ever, did not &s;eem to affect him much, for he laughed very heartily at the occa&s;ion of our meeting &s;o unexpectedly in this place.</P>
<P>After our mutual compliments were over, I inquired about his amour with the lady of fortune, which &s;eemed to be &s;o near a happy conclu&s;ion when I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him la&s;t; and, after an immoderate fit of laugh|ter, he gave me to under&s;tand, that he had been egregi|ou&s;ly bit in that affair. "You mu&s;t know," &s;aid he, <Q>that a few days after our adventure with the bawd and her b&mdash;ches, I found means to be married to that &s;ame fine lady you &s;peak of, and pa&s;&s;ed the night with her, at her lodgings, &s;o much to her &s;atisfaction, that early in the morning, after a good deal of &s;niveling and &s;obbing, &s;he owned, that, &s;o far from being an heire&s;s of a great fortune, &s;he was no other than a common woman of the town, who had decoyed me into matrimony, in order to enjoy the privilege of a <HI>femme couverte,</HI> and that, unle&s;s I made my e&s;cape immediately, I &s;hould be ar|re&s;ted for a debt of her contracting by bailiffs employed and in&s;tructed for that purpo&s;e. Startled at this inti|mation, I aro&s;e in a twinkling, and, taking leave of my &s;pou&s;e with &s;everal hearty damns, got &s;afe into the verge of the court, where I kept &s;nug until I was ap|pointed &s;urgeon's mate of a man of war at Port&s;mouth; for which place I &s;et out on a Sunday, went on board of my &s;hip, in which I &s;ailed to the Straits, where I had the good fortune to be made &s;urgeon of a &s;loop that came home in a few months after, and was put out of commi&s;&s;ion: whereupon I came to London, imagin|ing my&s;elf forgotten, and freed from my wife and her

creditors, but had not been in town a week before I was arre&s;ted for a debt of her's, amounting to 20<HI>l.</HI> and brought to this place, where I have been fixed by ano|ther action &s;ince that time. However, you know my di&s;po&s;ition; I defy care and anxiety, and, being on the half-pay li&s;t, make &s;hift to live here tolerably ea&s;y.</Q>&mdash;I congratulated him on his philo&s;ophy, and, remembering that I was in his debt, repaid the money he formerly le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t me, which I believe was far from being un&s;ea&s;onable. I then inquired about the economy of the place, which he explained to my &s;atisfaction, and, after we had agreed to me&s;s together, he was ju&s;t going to give orders for dinner when Strap arrived.</P>
<P>I never in my life &s;aw &s;orrow &s;o extravagantly expre&s;&s;ed in any countenance as in that of my hone&s;t friend, which was indeed particularly adapted by nature for &s;uch impre&s;|&s;ions. Being left by our&s;elves, I communicated to him my di&s;a&s;ter, and endeavoured to con&s;ole him with the &s;ame arguments he had formerly u&s;ed to me, withal repre&s;ent|ing the fair chance I had of being relieved in a &s;hort time by Mr. Bowling. But his grief was unutterable; he &s;eemed to give attention without li&s;tening, and wrung his hands in &s;ilence; &s;o that I was in a fair way of being infected with his behaviour, when Jack&s;on returned, and, perceiv|ing the deference I paid to Strap although in a footman's habit, di&s;tributed his cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mbs of comfort with &s;uch mirth, jollity, and unconcern, that the features of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;quire relaxed by degrees, he recovered the u&s;e of &s;peech, and began to be a little more reconciled to this lamentable event. We dined together on boiled beef and greens, brought from a cook's &s;hop in the neighbourhood; and, although this meal was &s;erved up in a manner little corre|&s;ponding with the &s;phere of life in which I had lately li|ved, I made a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, eat with a good appetite, and treated my friends with a bottle of wine, which had the de&s;ired effect of encrea&s;ing the good humour of my fellow-pri&s;oner, and exhilirating the &s;pirits of Strap, who now talked of my misfortune <HI>en cavalier.</HI></P>
<P>After dinner Jack&s;on left us to our private affairs&mdash;when I de&s;ired my friend to pack up all our things, and carry them to &s;ome cheap lodging he &s;hould chu&s;e for him&s;elf in the neighbourhood of the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, after he had di&s;|charged
<PB N="187" REF="027715_0428_0FD5EEDBB34048F8">
my lodging, for which I gave him money. I likewi&s;e recommended to him the keeping my misfortune &s;e|cret, and &s;aying to my landlord, or any other who &s;hould inquire for me, that I was gone into the country for a few weeks: at the &s;ame time I laid &s;trong injunctions upon him to call every &s;econd day upon Banter, in ca&s;e he &s;hould receive any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ters for me from Narci&s;&s;a by the channel of Freeman&punc; and by all means to leave a direction for him&s;elf at my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> lodgings in Wapping, by which I might be found when my kin&s;man &s;hould arrive.</P>
<P>When he departed to execute the&s;e orders, (which by the bye were punctually performed that very night,) I found my&s;elf &s;o little &s;ea&s;oned to my &s;ituation, that I dreaded reflection, and &s;ought &s;helter from it in the com|pany of the beau, who, promi&s;ing to regale me with a lecture upon ta&s;te, conducted me to the common &s;ide, where I &s;aw a number of naked mi&s;erable wretches a&s;&s;em|bled together. We had not been there many minutes when a figure appeared, wrapped in a dirty rug, tied about his loins with two pieces of li&s;t of different colours, knotted together, having a black bu&s;hy beard, and his head covered with a huge ma&s;s of brown periwig, which &s;eemed to have been ravi&s;hed from the crown of &s;ome &s;carecrow. This apparition &s;talking in with great &s;olem|nity, made a profound bow to the audience, who &s;ignified their approbation by a general re&s;pon&s;e of, <Q>How d'ye do, doctor?</Q> He then turned towards us, and ho|noured Jack&s;on with a particular &s;alutation; upon which, my friend, in a formal manner, introduced him to me by the name of Mr. Melopoyn. This ceremony being over, he advanced into the middle of the congregation, which crowded around him, and hemming three times, to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment, pronounced, with great &s;ignificance of voice and ge&s;ture, a very elegant and ingenious di&s;cour&s;e upon the difference between genius and ta&s;te, illu&s;trating his a&s;&s;ertions with apt quotations from the be&s;t authors, ancient as well as modern. When he had fini&s;hed his ha|rangue, which la&s;ted a full hour, he bowed again to the &s;pectators, not one of whom, I was informed, under&s;tood &s;o much as a &s;entence of what he had uttered. They manife&s;t|ed, however, their admiration and e&s;teem by voluntary con|tribution, which Jack&s;on told me, one week with another,
<PB N="188" REF="027715_0429_0FD5EEDD1C9E33D0">
amounted to eighteen pence. This moderate &s;tipend, to|gether with &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ents which he received for making up differences and deciding cau&s;es among&s;t the pri&s;oners, ju&s;t enabled him to breathe, and walk about in the grote&s;que figure I have de&s;cribed. I under&s;tood al&s;o, that he was an excellent poet, and had compo&s;ed a trage|dy, which was allowed, by every body who had &s;een it, to be a performance of great merit; that his learning was infinite, his morals unexceptionable, and his mode&s;ty in|vincible. Such a character could not fail of attracting my regard; I longed impatiently to be acquainted with him, and de&s;ired Jack&s;on would engage him to &s;pend the even|ing in my apartment. My reque&s;t was granted; he fa|voured us with his company, and, in the cour&s;e of our con|ver&s;ation, perceiving that I had a &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion for the <HI>belles lettres,</HI> acquitted him&s;elf &s;o well on that &s;ubject that I expre&s;&s;ed a fervent de&s;ire of &s;eeing his productions: in this too be gratified my inclination&mdash;he promi&s;ed to bring his tragedy to my room next day, and in the mean time entertained me with &s;ome detached pieces, which gave me a very advantageous idea of his poetical talent. A|mong other things I was particularly plea&s;ed with &s;ome elegies in imitation of Tibullus, one of which I beg leave to &s;ubmit to the reader, as a &s;pecimen of his complexion and capacity.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>I read Melopoyn's tragedy, and conceive a va&s;t opinion of his genius&mdash;he recounts his adventures.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHILE we eat our breakfa&s;t together, I acquainted him with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> character and condition of the poet, who came in with his play at that in&s;tant, and, imagining we were engaged about bu&s;ine&s;s, could not be prevailed upon to &s;it, but, leaving his performance, went away.&mdash;My friend's tender heart was melted at the &s;ight of a gen|tleman and Chri&s;tian (for he had a great veneration for both th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e epithets) in &s;uch mi&s;ery, and a&s;&s;ented with great cheerfulne&s;s to a propo&s;al I made of clothing him with our &s;uperfluities, a ta&s;k with which he charged him&s;elf, and departed immediately to perform it.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner gone than I locked my door, and &s;at down to the tragedy, which I read to the end with va&s;t plea&s;ure&punc; not a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at the conduct of the mana|gers who had rejected it. The fable, in my opinion, was well cho&s;en, and naturally conducted; the incidents in|tere&s;ting; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he characters beautifully contra&s;ted, &s;trongly marked, and well &s;upported; the diction poetical, &s;pirit|ed, and correct; the unities of the drama maintained with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous exactne&s;s; the opening gradual and engaging; the <HI>peripet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iaia</HI> &s;urpri&s;ing, and the cata&s;trophe affecting: in &s;hort, I judged it by the laws of Ari&s;totle and Horace, and could find nothing in it exceptionable but a little too much embelli&s;hment in &s;ome few places; which objection he removed to my &s;atisfaction by a quotation from Ari&s;totle's Poetics, importing&punc; that the lea&s;t inte|re&s;ting parts of a poem ought to be rai&s;ed and dignified by the charms and energy of diction.</P>
<P>I revered his genius, and was &s;eized with an eager curio&s;ity to know the particular events of a fortune &s;o unworthy of his merit. At that in&s;tant Strap return|ed with a bundle of clothes, which I &s;ent with my compliments to Mr. Melopoyn as a &s;mall token of my regard, and de&s;ired the favour of his company to din|ner. He accepted my pre&s;ent and invitation, and in le&s;s than half an hour made his appearance in a de|cent

dre&s;s, which altered his figure very much to his advantage. I perceived by his countenance that his heart was big with gratitude, and endeavoured to prevent his acknowledgments, by a&s;king pardon for the liberty I had taken; he made no reply, but, with an a&s;pect full of ad|miration and e&s;teem, bowed to the ground, while the tears gu&s;hed from his eyes. Affected with the&s;e &s;ymptoms of an ingenuous mind, I &s;hifted the conver&s;ation from this &s;ubject, and complimented him on his performance, which I a&s;&s;ured him afforded me infinite plea&s;ure. My approba|tion made him happy: dinner being &s;erved, and Jack&s;on arrived, I begged their permi&s;&s;ion for Strap to &s;it at table with us, after having informed them, that he was a per&s;on to whom I was extremely obliged; they were kind enough to grant that favour, and we eat together with great har|mony and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Our meal being ended, I expre&s;&s;ed my wonder at the little regard Mr. Melopoyn had met with from the world, and &s;ignified a de&s;ire of hearing how he had been treated by the managers of the play-hou&s;es, to whom, I under&s;tood from Jack&s;on, he had offered his tragedy without &s;ucce&s;s. <Q>There is &s;o little entertaining in the incidents of my life,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>that I am &s;ure the recital will not re|compen&s;e your attention; but, &s;ince you di&s;cover an inclination to know them, I under&s;tand my duty too well to di&s;appoint your de&s;ires.</Q></P>
<P>MY father, who was a curate in the country, being, by the narrowne&s;s of his circum&s;tances, hindered from main|taining me at the univer&s;ity, took the charge of my edu|cation upon him&s;elf, and laboured with &s;uch indu&s;try and concern in the undertaking, that I had little cau&s;e to re|gret the want of public ma&s;ters. Being at great pains to con&s;ult my natural bias, he di&s;covered in me, betimes, an inclination for poetry; upon which he recommended to me an intimate acquaintance with the cla&s;&s;ics, in the cul|tivation of which he a&s;&s;i&s;ted me with paternal zeal, and uncommon erudition. When he thought me &s;ufficiently acquainted with the ancients, he directed my &s;tudies to the be&s;t modern authors, French and Italian, as well as Engli&s;h, and laid a particular injunction upon me to make my&s;elf ma&s;ter of my mother tongue.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="027715_0433_0FD5EEEAADF9E1D8">
About the age of eighteen I grew ambitious of under|taking a work of &s;ome con&s;equence, and, with my father's approbation, actually planned the tragedy you have read; but, before I had fini&s;hed four acts, that indulgent parent died, and left my mother and me in very indigent circum|&s;tances. A near relation, compa&s;&s;ionating our di&s;tre&s;s, took us into his family, where I brought my fable to a conclu&s;ion, and &s;oon after my mother quitted this life.&mdash;When my &s;orrow for this melancholy event had &s;ub&s;ided, I told my kin&s;man, who was a farmer, that, having paid my la&s;t duty to my parent, I had now no attachment to detain me in the country, and therefore was re&s;olved to &s;et out for London, and offer my play to the &s;tage, where I did not doubt of acquiring a large &s;hare of fame as well as fortune, in which ca&s;e I &s;hould not be unmindful of my friends and benefactors. My cou&s;in was ravi&s;hed with the pro&s;pect of my felicity, and willingly contributed towards the expence of fitting me out for the expedition.</P>
<P>Accordingly I took a place in the waggon, and arrived in town, where I hired an apartment in a garret, willing to live as frugal as po&s;&s;ible until I &s;hould know what I had to expect from the manager, to whom I intended to offer my play&mdash;for though I looked upon my&s;elf as per|fectly &s;ecure of a good reception, imagining that a paten|tee would be as eager to receive as I to pre&s;ent my pro|duction, I did not know whether or not he might not be pre-engaged in favour of another author, which would certainly retard my &s;ucce&s;s. On this con&s;ideration too I determined to be &s;peedy in my application, and even to wait upon one of the managers the very next day. For this purpo&s;e I enquired of my landlord, if he knew where either or both of them lived? and he being curious to know my bu&s;ine&s;s, and at the &s;ame time appearing to be a very hone&s;t, friendly man, (a tallow-chandler,) I made him acquainted with my de&s;ign! upon which he told me, that I went the wrong way to work; that I would not find &s;uch ea&s;y acce&s;s to a manager as I imagined, and that, if I delivered my performance without proper recommenda|tion, it would be as one to a thou&s;and if ever it &s;hould be minded. "Take my advice," &s;aid he, <Q>and your bu&s;i|ne&s;s is done. One of the patentees is a good Catho|lic as I am, and u&s;es the &s;ame father who confe&s;&s;es me.
<PB N="193" REF="027715_0434_0FD5EEEC305B45C0">
I will make you acquainted with this good prie&s;t, who is an excellent &s;cholar, and if he &s;hould approve of your play, his recommendation will go a great way in de|termining Mr. Supple to bring it on the &s;tage.</Q> I ap|plauded his expedient, and was introduced to the friar, who, having peru&s;ed the tragedy, was plea&s;ed to &s;ignify his approbation, and commended me in particular for ha|ving avoided all reflections upon religion. He promi&s;ed to u&s;e all his influence with his &s;on Supple in my behalf, and to inform him&s;elf that very day, when it would be proper for me to wait upon him with the piece. He was punc|tual in performing his engagement, and next morning gave me to under&s;tand, that he had mentioned my affair to the manager, and that I had no more to do than to go to his hou&s;e any time in the forenoon, and make u&s;e of his name, upon which I &s;hould find immediate admittance. I took his advice, put my performance in my bo&s;om, and, having received directions, went immediately to the hou&s;e of Mr. Supple, and knocked at the door, which had a wicket in the middle, faced with a net-work of iron, through which a &s;ervant, having viewed me &s;ome time, demanded to know my bu&s;ine&s;s. I told him my bu&s;ine&s;s was with Mr. Supple, and that I came from Mr. O'Varni&s;h. He examined my appearance once more, then went away, returned in a few minutes, and &s;aid his ma&s;ter was bu&s;y, and could not be &s;een. Although I was a little mortified at my di&s;appoint|ment, I was per&s;uaded, that my reception was owing to Mr. Supple's ignorance of my errand; and, that I might meet with no more ob&s;tructions of the &s;ame kind, I de&s;i|red Mr. O'Varni&s;h to be my introductor the next time. He complied with my reque&s;t, and obtained immediate admittance to the manager, who received me with the ut|mo&s;t civility, and promi&s;ed to read my play with the fir&s;t convenience. By his own appointment I called again in a fortnight, but he was gone out; I returned in a week after, and the poor gentleman was extremely ill; I re|newed my vi&s;it in a fortnight after that, and he a&s;&s;ured me he had been &s;o much fatigued with bu&s;ine&s;s, that he had not been able as yet to read it to an end, but he would take the fir&s;t opportunity, and in the mean time ob&s;erved, that what he had yet &s;een of it was very entertaining. I comforted my&s;elf with this declaration a few weeks longer,
<PB N="194" REF="027715_0435_0FD5EEED9CD491C8">
at the end of which I appeared again before the wicket, was let in, and found him laid up with the gout. I no &s;ooner entered his chamber than, looking at me with a langui&s;hing eye, he pronounced, <Q>Mr. Melopoyn, I'm heartily &s;orry for an accident that has happened during my illne&s;s&mdash;you mu&s;t know, that my elde&s;t boy, finding your manu&s;cript upon the table in the dining-room where I u&s;ed to read it, carried it into the kitchen, and leaving it there, a negligent wench of a cook-maid, mi&s;taking it for wa&s;te-paper, has expended it all but a few leaves in &s;ingeing fowls upon the &s;pit&mdash;but I hope the misfortune is not irreparable, &s;ince, no doubt, you have &s;everal copies.</Q></P>
<P>I prote&s;t to you, my good friend, Mr. Random, I was extremely &s;hocked at this information! but the good-na|tured gentleman &s;eemed to be &s;o much affected with my misfortune, that I &s;uppre&s;&s;ed my concern, and told him that, although I had not another copy, I &s;hould be able to retrieve the lo&s;s by writing another from my memory, which was very tenacious. You cannot imagine how well plea&s;ed Mr. Supple was at this a&s;&s;urance; he begged I would &s;et about it immediately, and carefully revolve and recollect every circum&s;tance, before I pretended to commit it to paper, that it might be the &s;ame individual play he had peru&s;ed. Encouraged by this injunction, which plainly demon&s;trated how much he intere&s;ted him&s;elf in the affair, I ta&s;ked my remembrance and indu&s;try, and in three weeks produced the exact image of the former, which was con|veyed to him by my good friend Father O'Varni&s;h, who told me next day, that Mr. Supple would revi&s;e it &s;uper|ficially, in order to judge of its &s;amene&s;s with the other, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> give his final an&s;wer. For this examination I allotted a week, and, in full confidence of &s;eeing it acted in a little while, demanded an audience of the manager when that term was expired. But alas! the &s;ea&s;on had &s;lap|ped away in&s;en&s;ibly; he convinced me, that, if my play had been put into rehear&s;al at that time, it could not have been ready for performing until the end of March, when the be|nefit nights came on; con&s;equently it would have interfered with the intere&s;t of the players, whom it was my bu&s;ine&s;s not to di&s;oblige.</P>
<P>I was fain to acquie&s;ce in the&s;e rea&s;ons, which, to be
<PB N="195" REF="027715_0436_0FD5EEEF233C0CD0">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were extremely ju&s;t! and to re&s;erve my performance to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> next &s;ea&s;on, when he hoped I would not be &s;o un|lucky&mdash;Although it was a grievous di&s;appointment to me, who by this time began to want both money and ne|ce&s;&s;aries, having, on the &s;trength of my expectation from the theatre, launched out into &s;ome extravagances, by which the &s;um I had brought to town was already almo&s;t con&s;umed. Indeed, I ought to be a&s;hamed at this circum|&s;tance of my conduct; for my finances were &s;ufficient, with good economy, to have maintained me comfortably a whole year. You perhaps will be amazed when I tell you, that in &s;ix months I expended not a farthing le&s;s than ten guineas: but when one con&s;iders the temptations to which a young man is expo&s;ed in this great city, e&s;peci|ally if he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> addicted to plea&s;ure as I am, the wonder will vani&s;h, or at lea&s;t abate. Nor was the cau&s;e of my con|cern limited to my own &s;ituation entirely: I had wrote an account of my good reception to my kin&s;man the farmer, and de&s;ired him to depend upon me for the money he had kindly accommodated me with about the end of February; which promi&s;e I now found my&s;elf unable to perform.&mdash;However, there was no remedy but patience: I applied to my landlord, who was a very good-natured man, can|didly owned my di&s;tre&s;s, and begged his advice in laying down &s;ome plan for my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. He readily promi&s;ed to con&s;ult his confe&s;&s;or on this &s;ubject, and in the mean time told me, I was welcome to lodge and board with him, until fortune &s;hould put it in my power to make re&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>Mr. O'Varni&s;h, being informed of my nece&s;&s;ity, offered to introduce me to the author of a weekly paper, who, he did not doubt, would employ me in that way, provided he &s;hould find me duly qualified; but, upon enquiry, I under&s;tood, that this journal was calculated to foment di|vi&s;ions in the commonwealth, and therefore I de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from engaging in it. He then propo&s;ed, that I &s;hould write &s;omething in the poetical way, which I might di&s;po&s;e of to a book&s;eller for a pretty &s;um of ready money, and perhaps e&s;tabli&s;h my own character into the bargain: this event would infallibly procure friends, and my tragedy would appear next &s;ea&s;on to the be&s;t advan|tage, by being &s;upported both by intere&s;t and reputation.
<PB N="196" REF="027715_0437_0FD5EEF3F7497528">
I was charmed with this pro&s;pect, and, having heard what friends Mr. Pope acquired by his pa&s;torals, &s;et about a work of that kind, and in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks compo&s;ed as many eclogues, which I forthwith offered to an emi|nent book&s;eller, who de&s;ired I would leave them for his peru&s;al, and he would give me an an&s;wer in two days. At the end of that time I went to him, when he returned the poems, telling me they would not an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, and &s;weetened his refu&s;al by &s;aying there were &s;ome good clever lines in them. Not a little dejected at this rebuff, which I learned from Mr. O'Varni&s;h, was owing to the opinion of another author, whom this book&s;eller always con&s;ulted on the&s;e occa&s;ions, I applied to another per&s;on of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, who told me, that the town was cloyed with pa&s;torals, and advi&s;ed me, if I intended to profit by my talents, to write &s;omething &s;atirical or lu&s;|cious, &s;uch as <HI>The Button-hole, Shockey and Towzer, The Leaky Ve&s;&s;el, &amp;c.</HI> And yet this was a man in years, who wore a reverend periwig, looked like a &s;enator, and went regularly to church. Be that as it will, I &s;corned to pro|&s;titute my pen in the manner he propo&s;ed, and carried my papers to a third, who a&s;&s;ured me that poetry was entirely out of his way, and a&s;ked, if I had got never a piece of &s;ecret hi&s;tory thrown into a &s;eries of letters, or a volume of adventures, &s;uch as tho&s;e of Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe and Co|lonel Jack, or a collection of conundrums, wherewith to entertain the plantations? Being quite un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">urni&s;hed for this dealer, I had recour&s;e to another with as little &s;ucce&s;s, and I verily believe was rejected by the whole trade.</P>
<P>I was afterwards per&s;uaded to offer my&s;elf as a tran&s;la|tor, and accordingly repaired to a per&s;on who was &s;aid to entertain numbers of that cla&s;s in his pay: he a&s;&s;ured me he had already a great deal of that work on his hands, which he did not know what to do with, ob&s;erved, that tran&s;lation was a mere drug, that branch of literature being over&s;tocked by an inundation of authors from North-Britain, and a&s;ked what I would expect <HI>per</HI> &s;heet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or ren|dering the Latin cla&s;&s;ics into Engli&s;h. That I might not make my&s;elf too cheap, I determined to &s;et a high price upon my qualification, and demanded half a guinea for every tran&s;lated &s;heet.&mdash;"Half a guinea!" cried he, &s;ta|ring at me; then pau&s;ed a little, and &s;aid he had no oc|ca&s;ion

for my &s;ervice at pre&s;ent. I found my error, and, re&s;olving to make amends, fell one half in my demand: upon which he &s;tared at me again, and told me his hands were full. I attempted others without finding employ|ment, and was actually reduced to a very uncomfortable pro&s;pect, when I bethought my&s;elf of offering my talents to the printers of halfpenny ballads, and other &s;uch occa|&s;ional e&s;&s;ays as are hawked about the &s;treets. With this view I applied to one of the mo&s;t noted and vociferous of this tribe, who directed me to a per&s;on whom I found en|tertaining a whole crowd of them with gin, bread, and chee&s;e: he carried me into a little back parlour, very neatly furni&s;hed, where I &s;ignified my de&s;ire of being en|rolled among his writers, and was a&s;ked what kind of compo&s;ition I profe&s;&s;ed? Under&s;tanding that my inclination leaned towards poetry, he expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction, telling me, one of his poets had lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es, and was confined in Bedlam, and the other was become dozed by drinking drams; &s;o that he had not done any thing tolerable the&s;e many weeks. When I propo&s;ed, that he &s;hould enter into terms of agreement, he gave me to under&s;tand, that his bargains were always conditional, and his authors paid in proportion to the &s;ale of their works.</P>
<P>Having therefore &s;ettled the&s;e conditions, which (I do a&s;&s;ure you) were not very advantageous to me, he a&s;&s;igned me a &s;ubject for a ballad, which was to be fini&s;hed in two hours; and I retired to my garret in order to perform his injunction.&mdash;As the theme happened to &s;uit my fancy, I completed a pretty &s;ort of an ode within the time pre|&s;cribed, and brought it to him, big with hope of profit and plea&s;ure. He read it in a twinkling, and, to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment, told me it would not do; though indeed, he owned I wrote a good hand, and &s;pelled very well, but my language was too high flown, and of con&s;equence not at all adapted to the capacity and ta&s;te of his cu&s;tomers.&mdash;I promi&s;ed to rectify that mi&s;take, and in half an hour humbled my &s;tyle to the comprehen&s;ion of vulgar readers: he approved of the alteration, and gave me &s;ome hopes of &s;ucceeding in time, though he ob&s;erved that my perform|ance was very deficient in quaintne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion that plea&s;es the multitude: however, to encourage me, he ven|tured
<PB N="198" REF="027715_0439_0FD5EF2170FEF030">
the expence of printing and paper, and, if I remem|ber aright, my &s;hare of the &s;ale amounted to four pence halfpenny.</P>
<P>From that day, I &s;tudied the Grub-&s;treet manner with great diligence, and at length became &s;uch a proficient, that my works were in great reque&s;t among the mo&s;t polite of the chairmen, draymen, hackney-coachmen, footmen, and &s;ervant maids: nay, I have enjoyed the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing my productions adorned with cuts, pa&s;ted upon the wall as ornaments in beer-cellars, and coblers &s;talls; and have actually heard them &s;ung in clubs of &s;ub&s;tantial trade&s;|men.&mdash;But empty prai&s;e, (you know, my dear friend,) will not &s;upply the cravings of nature.&mdash;I found my&s;elf in danger of &s;tarving in the mid&s;t of all my fame; for of ten &s;ongs I compo&s;ed, it was well if two had the good fortune to plea&s;e.&mdash;For this rea&s;on I turned my thoughts to pro&s;e, and during a tract of gloomy weather, publi&s;hed an appa|rition, on the &s;ub&s;tance of which I &s;ub&s;i&s;ted very com|fortably a whole month: I have made many a good meal upon a mon&s;ter; a rape has often afforded me great &s;ati&s;|faction; but a murder, well-timed, was my never-failing re&s;ource.&mdash;What then!

<P>I MADE &s;hift, notwith&s;tanding, to maintain my&s;elf till the beginning of next winter, when I renewed my ad|dre&s;&s;es to my friend Mr. Supple, and was mo&s;t graciou&s;ly received.&mdash;<Q>I have been thinking of your affair, Mr. Melopoyn,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>and am determined to &s;hew how far I have your intere&s;t at heart, by introducing you to a young nobleman of my acquaintance, who is re|markable for his fine ta&s;te in dramatic writings, and is, be&s;ide, a man of &s;uch influence, that if once he &s;hould

<P>Not to trouble you with idle particulars. I carried my tragedy to his Lord&s;hip's lodgings, and &s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t up along with Mr. Supple's letter, by one of his &s;ervants, who de|&s;ired me, by his Lord&s;hip's order, to return in a week.&mdash;I did &s;o, and was admitted to his Lord&s;hip, who receiv|ed me very courteou&s;ly, told me he had peru&s;ed my play, which he thought on the whole, was the be&s;t <HI>coup d' e&s;&s;ai</HI> he had ever &s;een; but that he had marked &s;ome places in the margin, which he imagined might be altered for the better.&mdash;I was tran&s;ported with this reception, and pro|mi&s;ed, (with many acknowledgments of his Lord&s;hip's genero&s;ity,) to be governed &s;olely by his advice and di|rection.&mdash;"Well, then," &s;aid he, <Q>write another fair co|py with the alterations I have propo&s;ed, and bring it to me as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, for I am re&s;olved to have it brought on the &s;tage this winter.</Q>&mdash;You may be &s;ure I &s;et about this ta&s;k with alacrity, and although I found his Lord&s;hip's remarks much more numerous and of le&s;s importance than I expected, I thought it was not my in|tere&s;t to di&s;pute about trifles with my patron; therefore new-modelled it according to his de&s;ire, in le&s;s than a month.</P>
<P>When I waited upon him with the manu&s;cript, I found one of the actors at breakfa&s;t with his Lord&s;hip, who im|mediately introduced him to my acquaintance, and de&s;ir|ed him to read a &s;cene of my play.&mdash;This ta&s;k he performed very much to my &s;atisfaction with regard to empha&s;is and pronunciation; but he &s;ignified his di&s;gu&s;t at &s;everal words in every page, which I pre&s;uming to defend, Lord Rat|tle told me, with a peremptory look, I mu&s;t not pretend
<PB N="200" REF="027715_0441_0FD5CDA2266675A8">
to di&s;pute with him, who had been a player the&s;e twenty years, and under&s;tood the economy of the &s;tage better than any man living. I was forced to &s;ubmit, and his Lord&s;hip propo&s;ed the &s;ame actor &s;hould read the whole play, in the evening, before &s;ome gentleman of his ac|quaintance, whom he would convene at his lodgings for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I was pre&s;ent at the reading; and I prote&s;t to you, my dear friend, I never underwent &s;uch a &s;evere trial in the whole cour&s;e of my life, as at that juncture! for although the player might be a very hone&s;t man and a good per|former, he was exce&s;&s;ively illiterate and a&s;&s;uming, and made a thou&s;and frivolous objections, which I was not permitted to an&s;wer: however, the piece was very much applauded on the whole; the gentlemen pre&s;ent, who I under&s;tood were men of fortune, promi&s;ed to countenance and &s;upport it as much as they could; and Lord Rattle a&s;&s;uring me, that he would act the part of a careful nur&s;e to it, de&s;ired me to carry it home, and alter immediate|ly according to their remarks.&mdash;I was fain to acquie&s;ce in his determination, and fulfilled his injunctions with all the expedition in my power; but before I could pre&s;ent the new copy, my good friend Mr. Supple had di&s;po&s;ed of his property and patent to one Mr. Brayer; &s;o that fre&s;h intere&s;t was to be made with the new manager.&mdash;This ta&s;k Lord Rattle undertook, having &s;ome acquaintance with him, and recommended my performance &s;o &s;trongly that it was received.</P>
<P>I looked upon my&s;elf now, as upon the eve of reaping the fruits of all my labour: I waited a few days in ex|pectation of its being put into rehear&s;al, and wondering at the delay, applied to my worthy patron, who excu&s;ed Mr. Brayer on account of the multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s in which he was involved; and bid me beware of teazing the patentee.&mdash;I trea&s;ured up this caution, and exerted my patience three weeks longer; at the end of which his Lord&s;hip gave me to under&s;tand, that Mr. Brayer had read my play, and owned it had indubitable merit; but as he had long been pre-engaged to another author, he could not po&s;&s;ibly repre&s;ent it that &s;ea&s;on; though, if I would re&s;erve it for the next, and in the interim make

&s;uch alterations as he had propo&s;ed by ob&s;ervations in the margin, I might depend upon his compliance.</P>
<P>Thunder&s;truck at this di&s;appointment, I could not, for &s;ome minutes, utter one &s;yllable: at length, however, I complained bitterly of the manager's in&s;incerity in amu|&s;ing me &s;o long, when he knew from the beginning, that he could not gratify my de&s;ire.&mdash;But his Lord&s;hip repri|manded me for my freedom, &s;aid Mr. Brayer was a man of honour, and imputed his behaviour, with re&s;pect to me, to nothing el&s;e but forgetfulne&s;s.&mdash;And indeed I have had &s;ome rea&s;on, &s;ince that time, to be convinced of his bad memory; for, in &s;pite of appearances, I will not al|low my&s;elf to interpret his conduct any other way.&mdash;Lord Rattle ob&s;erving me very much affected with my di&s;ap|pointment, offered his intere&s;t to bring on my play at the other hou&s;e, which I eagerly accepting, he forthwith wrote a letter of recommendation to Mr. Bellower, actor and prime mini&s;ter to Mr. Vandal, proprietor of that theatre; and de&s;ired me to deliver it with my tragedy, without lo&s;s of time.&mdash;Accordingly, I ha&s;tened to his hou&s;e, where, after having waited a whole hour in a lob|by, I was admitted to his pre&s;ence, and my performance received with great &s;tate.&mdash;He told me he was extremely bu&s;y at pre&s;ent, but he would peru&s;e it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble; and bid me call again in a week. I took my leave, not a little a&s;toni&s;hed at the port and &s;upercilious beha|viour of this &s;tage player, who had not treated me with good manners; and began to think the dignity of a poet greatly impaired &s;ince the days of Euripides and Sopho|cles; but all this was nothing in compari&s;on of what I have &s;ince ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Well, Mr. Random, I went back at the appointed time, and was told that Mr. Bellower was engaged, and could not &s;ee me.&mdash;I repeated my vi&s;it a few days after, and having waited a con&s;iderable time, was favoured with an audience, during which he &s;aid, he had not as yet read my play.&mdash;Nettled at this u&s;age, I could contain my&s;elf no longer, but telling him, I imagined he would have paid more deference to Lord Rattle's recommendation, demanded my manu&s;cript with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;ent|ment.&mdash;"Ay," &s;aid he, in a theatrical tone, <Q>with all my heart.</Q>&mdash;Then pulling out a drawer of the bureau

at which he &s;at, he took out a bundle, and threw it upon a table that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear him, pronouncing the word, "There," with great di&s;dain.&mdash;I took it up, and perceiving, with &s;ome &s;urprize, that it was a comedy, told him, it did not belong to me; upon which he offered me another, which I al&s;o di&s;claimed.&mdash;A third was produced, and rejected for the &s;ame rea&s;on. At length he pulled out a whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">andful, and &s;pread them before me, &s;aying, <Q>There are &s;even&mdash;take which you plea&s;e&mdash;or take them all.</Q>&mdash;I &s;ingled out my own, and went away, &s;truck dumb with admiration at what I had &s;een&mdash;not &s;o much on account of his in&s;olence, as of the number of new plays, which, from this circum&s;tance, I concluded were yearly offered to the &s;tage.&mdash;You may be &s;ure I did not fail to carry my complaint to my patron, who did not receive it with all the indignation I expected; but taxed me with precipi|tation, and told me, I mu&s;t lay my account with bearing the humours of the players, if I intended to write for the &s;tage.&mdash;"There is now no other remedy," &s;aid he, <Q>but to keep it till the next &s;ea&s;on for Mr. Brayer, and alter it at your lei&s;ure in the &s;ummer time, according to his directions.</Q>&mdash;I was now reduced to a terrible alterna|tive, either to quit all hopes of my tragedy, from which I had all along promi&s;ed my&s;elf a large &s;hare of fortune and reputation, or to encounter eight long months of ad|ver&s;ity, in preparing for, and expecting its appearance.&mdash;This la&s;t penance, painful as it was, &s;eemed mo&s;t eligible to my reflection at that time, and therefore I re&s;olved to undergo it.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould I tire you with particulars of no con&s;e|quence? I wre&s;tled with extreme poverty, until the time of my probation was expired; and went to my Lord Rat|tle, in order to remind him of my affair, when I under|&s;tood, to my great concern, that his Lord&s;hip was on the point of going abroad, and, which was &s;till more unfor|tunate for me, Mr. Brayer had gone into the country; &s;o that my generous patron had it not in his power to intro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ace me per&s;onally, as he intended: however, he wrote every &s;trong letter to the manager in my favour, and put him in mind of the promi&s;e he had made in behalf of my play.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was certified of Mr. Brayer's return, I
<PB N="203" REF="027715_0444_0FD5EEFB169D94D0">
went to his hou&s;e with this letter, but was told he was gone out.&mdash;I called again next day early in the morning, received the &s;ame an&s;wer, and was de&s;ired to leave my name and bu&s;ine&s;s. I did &s;o, and returned the day after, when the &s;ervant &s;till affirmed, that his ma&s;ter was gone abroad, though I perceived him, as I retired, ob&s;erving me through a window.&mdash;Incen&s;ed at this di&s;covery I went to a coffee-hou&s;e hard by, and inclo&s;ing his Lord&s;hip's letter in one from my&s;elf, demanded a categorical an|&s;wer. I &s;ent it to his hou&s;e by a porter, who returned in a few minutes, and told me Mr. Brayer would be glad to &s;ee me that in&s;tant.&mdash;I obeyed the &s;ummons, and was received with &s;uch profu&s;ion of compliments and apolo|gies, that my re&s;entment immediately &s;ub&s;ided, and I was even in pain for the concern which this hone&s;t man &s;hew|ed at the mi&s;take of his &s;ervant, who, it &s;eems, had been ordered to deny him to every body but me.&mdash;He expre&s;|&s;ed the utmo&s;t veneration for his good and noble friend Lord Rattle, whom he &s;hould always be proud to &s;erve; promi&s;ed to peru&s;e the play with all di&s;patch, and give me a meeting upon it; and, as a te&s;timony of his e&s;teem, made me a pre&s;ent of a general order for the &s;ea&s;on, by which I &s;hould be admitted to any part of the theatre.&mdash;This was a very agreeable compliment to me, who&s;e greate&s;t plea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ted in &s;eeing dramatic performan|ces, and you need not doubt that I often availed my&s;elf of my privilege. As I had an opportunity of being be|hind the &s;cenes when I plea&s;ed, I frequently conver&s;ed with Mr. Brayer about my play, and a&s;ked when he intend|ed to put it into rehear&s;al; but he had always &s;o much bu&s;i|ne&s;s upon his hands, that it remained with him unopened a con&s;iderable while; and I became very unea&s;y about the &s;ea&s;on, that wa&s;ted apace, when I &s;aw in the papers ano|ther new play adverti&s;ed, which had been written, offer|ed, accepted and rehear&s;ed in the compa&s;s of three months, without my knowledge or &s;u&s;picion.&mdash;You may ea&s;ily gue&s;s how much I was confounded at this event! I own to you that, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of my anger, I &s;u&s;pect|ed Mr. Brayer of having acted towards me in the mo&s;t pitiful, perfidious manner; and was actually glad at his di&s;appointment in the &s;ucce&s;s of his favourite piece, which by the &s;trength of art lingered till the third night, and
<PB N="204" REF="027715_0445_0FD5EF0093DCEA48">
then died in a deplorable manner. But, now that pa&s;&s;ion has no &s;hare in my reflection, I am willing to a&s;cribe his behaviour to his want of memory, or want of judgment, which, you know, are natural defects, that are more worthy of compa&s;&s;ion than reproach.</P>
<P>About this time I happened to be in company with a gentlewoman, who having heard of my tragedy, told me, &s;he was acquainted with the wife of a gentleman, who was very well known to a lady, who had great intere&s;t with a per&s;on who was intimate with Earl Sheerwit, and that, if I plea&s;ed, &s;he would u&s;e her influence in my be|half.&mdash;As this nobleman had the character of a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ecenas in the nation, and could &s;tamp a value upon any work by his &s;ole countenance and approbation, I accepted her of|fer with eagerne&s;s, in full confidence of &s;eeing my reputa|tion e&s;tabli&s;hed, and my wi&s;hes fulfilled in a very &s;hort time, provided that I &s;hould have the good fortune to plea&s;e his Lord&s;hip's ta&s;te. I withdrew the manu&s;cript from the hands of Mr. Brayer, and committed it to the care of this gentlewoman, who laboured &s;o effectually in my intere&s;t, that in le&s;s than a month it was conveyed to the Earl, and in a few weeks after, I had the &s;atisfaction to hear that he had read and approved it very much. Tran&s;ported with this piece of intelligence, I flattered my&s;elf with the hopes of his intere&s;ting him&s;elf in its fa|vour; but hearing no more of the matter in three whole months, I began (God forgive me!) to &s;u&s;pect the vera|city of the per&s;on who brought me the good tidings; for I thought it impo&s;&s;ible, that a man of his rank and cha|racter, who knew the difficulty of writing a good trage|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and under&s;tood the dignity of the work, &s;hould read and applaud an e&s;&s;ay of this kind, without feeling an in|clination to befriend the author, whom his countenance alone could rai&s;e above dependence. But it was not long before I found my friend very much wronged by my opinion.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know that the civilities I had received from Lord Rattle, and the de&s;ire he manife&s;ted to promote the &s;ucce&s;s of my play, encouraged me to write an account of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad fortune to his Lord&s;hip, who conde&s;cended &s;o far, as to de&s;ire, by letter, a young &s;quire of a great e&s;tate, with whom he was intimate, to e&s;pou&s;e my cau&s;e, and in
<PB N="205" REF="027715_0446_0FD5EF01D7C27560">
particular to make me acquainted with one Mr. Marmo|zet, a celebrated player, who had lately appeared on the &s;tage with a&s;toni&s;hing eclat, and bore &s;uch &s;way in the hou&s;e where he acted, that the managers dur&s;t not refu&s;e any thing he recommended. The young gentleman, whom Lord Rattle had employed for this purpo&s;e, being diffi|dent of his own intere&s;t with Mr. Marmozet, had recour&s;e to a nobleman of his acquaintance, who, at his &s;olicitation, was &s;o good as to introduce me to him; and the conver|&s;ation turning upon my performance, I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed as well as plea&s;ed to hear, that Earl Sheerwit had &s;poke very much in its prai&s;e, and even &s;ent Mr. Mar|mozet the copy, with a me&s;&s;age, expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire that he would act in it next &s;ea&s;on.&mdash;Nor was the favourite actor backward in commending the piece, which he mentioned with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of regard that I do not chu&s;e to re|peat; a&s;&s;uring me that he would appear in it, provided he &s;hould be engaged to play at all during the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on. In the mean time he de&s;ired I would give him leave to peru&s;e it in the country, whither he intended to remove next day, that he might have lei&s;ure to con&s;ider and point out &s;uch alterations as might, perhaps, be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the <HI>jeu de theatre;</HI> and took my direction, that he might communicate by letter, the ob&s;ervations he &s;hould make. Tru&s;ting to the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, and the in|tere&s;t which had been made in my behalf, I hugged my|&s;elf in the expectation of &s;eeing it, not only acted, but acted to the greate&s;t advantage, which I thought could not fail of recompen&s;ing me in an ample manner, for the anxiety and affliction I had undergone: but &s;ix weeks be|ing elap&s;ed, I did not know how to reconcile Mr. Mar|mozet's &s;ilence, with his promi&s;e of writing to me in ten days after he &s;et out for the country; however, I was at la&s;t favoured with a letter, importing that he had made &s;ome remarks on my tragedy, which he would freely im|pare at meeting, and advi&s;ed me to put it, without lo&s;s of time, into the hands of that manager, who had the be&s;t company; as he him&s;elf was quite uncertain whether or not he &s;hould be engaged that winter.&mdash;I was a good deal alarmed at this la&s;t part of his letter, and advi&s;ed about it with a friend, who told me, it was a plain indication of Mr. Marmozet's de&s;ire to get rid of his promi&s;e; that his
<PB N="206" REF="027715_0447_0FD5EF0356A107A0">
pretended uncertainty about acting next winter, was no other than a &s;candalous eva&s;ion; for to his certain know|ledge, he was already engaged, or, at lea&s;t, in terms with Mr. Vandal; and that his de&s;ign was to di&s;appoint me, in favour of a new comedy, which he had purcha&s;ed of the author, and was intended to bring upon the &s;tage, for his own advantage.&mdash;In &s;hort, my dear Sir, this per&s;on, who, I mu&s;t own, is of a very &s;anguine complexion, hand|led the moral character of Mr. Marmozet with &s;uch &s;eve|rity that I began to &s;u&s;pect him of &s;ome particular pre|judice, and put my&s;elf upon my guard again&s;t his in&s;inu|ations.&mdash;I ought to crave pardon for this tedious narra|tion of trivial circum&s;tances, which, however intere&s;ting they may be to me, mu&s;t certainly be very dry and in&s;i|pid to the ear of one unconcerned in the affair.&mdash;But I under&s;tand the meaning of your looks, and will proceed. Well, Sir, Mr. Marmozet, upon his return to town, treat|ed me with uncommon complai&s;ance, and invited me to his lodgings, where he propo&s;ed to communicate his re|marks, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> confe&s;s, were more unfavourable than I expected; but I an&s;wered his objections, and, as I thought, brought him over to my opinion; for, on the whole, he &s;ignified the highe&s;t approbation of the performance. In the cour&s;e of our di&s;pute, I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find this poor gentleman's memory &s;o treacherous as to let him forget what he had &s;aid to me before he went out of town, in regard to Earl Sheerwit's opinion of my play, which he now profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf ignorant of; and I was extremely mortified at hearing from his own mouth, that his intere&s;t with Mr. Vandal was &s;o very low, as to be in|&s;ufficient of it&s;elf, to bring a new piece upon the &s;tage. I then begged his advice, and he coun&s;elled me to apply to Earl Sheerwit for a me&s;&s;age in my favour to the mana|ger, who would not pre&s;ume to refu&s;e any thing recom|mended by &s;o great a man; and he was &s;o kind as to promi&s;e to &s;econd this me&s;&s;age with all his power.&mdash;I had immediate recour&s;e to the worthy gentlewoman my friend already mentioned, who opened the channels of her con|veyance with &s;uch expedition, that in a few days, I had the promi&s;e of the me&s;&s;age, provided I could in&s;ure my&s;elf of Mr. Vandal's being unengaged to any other author; for his lord&s;hip did not chu&s;e to conde&s;cend &s;o far, until he &s;hould
<PB N="207" REF="027715_0448_0FD5EF052AC38668">
under&s;tand that there was a probability, at lea&s;t, of &s;uc|ceeding. At the &s;ame time in which I was ble&s;&s;ed with this piece of news, I was &s;tartled at another, by the &s;ame canal of communication; which was, that Mr. Marmo|zet, before he advi&s;ed me to this application, had inform|ed the Earl, that he had read my play, and found it al|together unfit for the &s;tage.&mdash;Though I could not doubt the certainty of this intelligence, I believed there was &s;ome mi&s;apprehen&s;ion in the ca&s;e; and without taking any notice of it, told Mr. Marmozet the an&s;wer I had been, favoured with; upon which he te&s;tified much joy, and promi&s;ed to a&s;k Mr. Vandal the que&s;tion propo&s;ed.&mdash;I waited upon him in a day or two, when he gave me to under&s;tand, that Mr. Vandal having profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf free of all engagements, he had put my play into his hands, and repre&s;ented it as a piece &s;trongly recommended by Earl Sheerwit, who, he a&s;&s;ured him, would honour him, with a me&s;&s;age in its favour; and he de&s;ired me to call for an an&s;wer at Mr. Vandal's hou&s;e in three days.&mdash;I followed his directions, and found the manager, who, be|ing made acquainted with my bu&s;ine&s;s, owned, that Mr. Marmozet had given him a manu&s;cript play, but denied that he had mentioned Earl Sheerwit's name.&mdash;When I informed him of the circum&s;tances of the affair, he &s;aid he had no engagement with any author: that he would read my tragedy forthwith; and did not believe he &s;hould ven|ture to reject it in contradiction to his lord&s;hip's opinion, for which he had the utmo&s;t veneration, but put it into rehear&s;al without lo&s;s of time.&mdash;I was &s;o much intoxicat|ed with this encouragement, that I overlooked the my&s;te|rious conduct of Mr. Marmozet, and attended the mana|ger at the time appointed, when, to my infinite confu&s;ion, he pronounced my play improper for the &s;tage, and re|jected it accordingly. As &s;oon as I could recollect my|&s;elf from the di&s;order into which this unexpected refu&s;al had thrown me, I expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of hearing his objec|tions, which were &s;o groundle&s;s, indi&s;tinct, and unintel|ligible, that I per&s;uaded my&s;elf he had not at all peru&s;ed the piece, but had been prompted by &s;omebody, who&s;e le&s;&s;ons he had not rightly retained. However, I have been &s;ince informed, that the poor man's head, which was not naturally very clear, had been di&s;ordered with &s;uper|&s;tition,
<PB N="208" REF="027715_0449_0FD5EF0C5BFEE2A8">
and that he laboured under the tyranny of a wife, and the terrors of hell fire at the &s;ame time.&mdash;Precipitated in this manner from the highe&s;t pinnacle of hope to the aby&s;s of de&s;pondence, I was ready to &s;ink under the bur|den of my affliction; and, in the bitterne&s;s of my angui&s;h, could not help entertaining &s;ome doubts of Mr. Marmo|zet's integrity, when I recollected and compared the cir|cum&s;tances of his conduct towards me. I was encouraged in this &s;u&s;picion by being told, that my Lord Sheerwit had &s;poke of his character with great contempt; and in particular re&s;ented his in&s;olence in oppo&s;ing his own ta&s;te to that of his lord&s;hip, concerning my tragedy.&mdash;While I he&s;itated between two different opinions of the matter, that friend, who, as I told you before, was a little hot|headed, favoured me with a vi&s;it, and having heard a cir|cum&s;tantial account of the whole affair, could not contain his indignation, but affirmed without ceremony, that Marmozet was the &s;ole occa&s;ion of my di&s;appointment; that he had acted from fir&s;t to la&s;t with the mo&s;t perfidious di&s;&s;imulation, cajoling me with in&s;inuating civilities, while he under-hand employed all his art and influence to pre|judice the ignorant manager again&s;t my performance; that nothing could equal his hypocri&s;y, but his avarice, which engro&s;&s;ed the faculties of his &s;oul &s;o much, that he &s;cru|pled not to be guilty of the meane&s;t practices to gratify that &s;ordid appetite; that, in con&s;equence of this di&s;po|&s;ition, he had pro&s;tituted his honour in betraying my in|experience, and in undermining the intere&s;t of another author of e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation, who had al&s;o offered a tragedy to the &s;tage, which he thought would interfere with the &s;ucce&s;s of the comedy he had bought, and deter|mined to bring on at all events.</P>
<P>I was &s;hocked at the de&s;cription of &s;uch a mon&s;ter, which I could not believe exi&s;ted in the world, bad as it is, and argued again&s;t the a&s;&s;everations of my friend&punc; by demon&s;trating the bad policy of &s;uch behaviour, which could not fail of entailing infamy upon the author; and the &s;mall temptation that a man of Mr. Marmozet's figure and &s;ucce&s;s could have to con&s;ult his intere&s;t in &s;uch a grovelling manner, which mu&s;t create contempt and abhor|rence of him in his patrons, and effectually deprive him of the countenance and protection he now enjoys in &s;uch
<PB N="209" REF="027715_0450_0FD5EF0C6018EB40">
an eminent degree. He pretended to laugh at my &s;impli|city, and a&s;ked if I knew for which of his virtues he was &s;o much care&s;&s;ed by the people of fa&s;hion.&mdash;"It is not," &s;aid he, <Q>for the qualities of his heart, that this little para&s;ite is invited to the tables of dukes and lords, who hire extraordinary cooks for his entertainment: his avarice they &s;ee not, his ingratitude they feel not, his hypocri&s;y accommodates it&s;elf to their humours, and is of con&s;equence plea&s;ing; but he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hiefly courted for his buffoonery, and will be admitted into the choice&s;t parties of quality for his talent of mimicking Punch and his wife Joan, when a poet, of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite genius, is not able to attract the lea&s;t regard.</Q>&mdash;God forbid, Mr. Random, that I &s;hould credit a&s;&s;ertions that degrade the dignity of our &s;uperiors &s;o much, and repre|&s;ent that poor man as the mo&s;t object of all beings! No! I looked upon them as the hyperboles of pa&s;&s;ion; and, though that comedy of which he &s;poke, did actually ap|pear, I dare not doubt the innocence of Mr. Marmozet, who, I am told, is as much as ever in favour with the earl; a circum&s;tance &s;urely that could not happen, unle&s;s he had vindicated his character to the &s;atisfaction of his lord&s;hip.&mdash;Pray forgive this long digre&s;&s;ion, and give me the hearing a little longer; for, thank Heaven, I am now near the goal.</P>
<P>Baffled in all my attempts, I de&s;paired of &s;eeing my play acted, and bethought my&s;elf of chu&s;ing &s;ome employment that might afford me a &s;ure, though mean &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; but my landlord, to whom I was by this time con&s;iderably indebted, and who had laid his account with having his money paid all in a heap from the profits of my third night, could not brook his di&s;appointment; therefore, made another effort in my behalf, and by dint of intere&s;t procured a me&s;&s;age from a lady of fa&s;hion to Mr. Brayer, who had always profe&s;&s;ed a great veneration for her, de&s;iring that he would &s;et up my play forthwith, and a&s;&s;uring him that &s;he and all her friends would &s;upport it in the performance: to &s;trengthen my intere&s;t, &s;he engaged his be&s;t actors in my cau&s;e, and, in &s;hort, exerted her&s;elf &s;o much, that it was again received, and my hopes began to revive. But Mr. Brayer, hone&s;t man, was &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by bu&s;ine&s;s of va&s;t con&s;equence, though to ap|pearance

he had nothing at all to do, that he could not find time to read it till the &s;ea&s;on was pretty far advanced; and read it he mu&s;t; for, notwith&s;tanding his having pe|ru&s;ed it before, his memory did not retain one circum&s;tance of the matter.</P>
<P>At length he favoured it with his attention, and, having propo&s;ed certain alterations, &s;ent his duty to the lady who patroni&s;ed it, and promi&s;ed on his honour to bring it on next winter, provided the&s;e alterations &s;hould be made, and the copy delivered to him be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore the end of April. With an aching heart I &s;ubmitted to the&s;e conditions, and performed them accordingly; but fortune owed me ano|ther unfore&s;een mortification; Mr. Marmozet, during the &s;ummer, became joint patentee with Mr. Brayer; &s;o, that when I claimed performance of articles, I was told he could do nothing without the con&s;ent of his partner, who was pre-engaged to another author.</P>
<P>My condition was rendered de&s;perate by the death of my good friend and landlord, who&s;e executors obtained judgment again&s;t my effects, which they &s;eized, turned me out into the &s;treets naked, friendle&s;s, and forlorn; there I was arre&s;ted at the &s;uit of my taylor, and thrown into pri&s;on, where I have made &s;hift to live the&s;e five weeks on the bounty of my fellow pri&s;oners, who, I hope, are not the wor&s;e of the in&s;truction and good offices by which I manife&s;t my gratitude: but, in &s;pite of all their charitable endeavours, my life was &s;carce tolerable, until your un|common benevolence enabled me to enjoy it with comfort.</P>

<P>I am &s;eized with a deep melancholy, and become a &s;loven&mdash;am relieved by my uncle&mdash;he prevails upon me to engage with his owners, as a &s;urgeon of the &s;hip which he com|mands&mdash;he makes me a con&s;iderable pre&s;ent&mdash;entertains Strap as his &s;teward&mdash;I take leave of my friends, and go on board&mdash;the &s;hip arrives at the Downs.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I SHALL not make any reflections on this &s;tory, in the cour&s;e of which the reader mu&s;t perceive how egregi|ou&s;ly the &s;implicity and milky di&s;po&s;ition of this worthy man had been doped and abu&s;ed by a &s;et of &s;coundrels,

who were &s;o habituated to fal&s;ehood and equivocation, that I verily believe they could not utter one &s;yllable of truth, though their lives depended upon their &s;incerity. Notwith&s;tanding all I had &s;uffered from the knavery and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of mankind, I was amazed and incen&s;ed at the ba&s;e indifference, which &s;uffered &s;uch uncommon merit as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to langui&s;h in ob&s;curity, and &s;truggle with all the mi&s;eries of a loath&s;ome goal, and &s;hould have ble&s;&s;ed the occa&s;ion that &s;ecluded me from &s;uch a perfidious world, had not the remembrance of the amiable Narci&s;&s;a pre&s;erved my attachment to that &s;ociety, of which &s;he con&s;tituted a part. The picture of that lovely creature was the con|&s;tant companion of my &s;olitude; how often did I contem|plate the re&s;emblance of tho&s;e enchanting features that fir&s;t captivated my heart! how often did I weep over tho&s;e endearing &s;cenes which her image recalled! and how often did I cur&s;e my perfidious fate, for having robbed me of the fair original! In vain did my imagination flatter me with &s;chemes of future happine&s;s; &s;urly rea&s;on always inter|po&s;ed, and in a moment overthrew the un&s;ub&s;tantial fabric by cha&s;ti&s;ing the extravagance of my hope, and repre&s;ent|ing my unhappy &s;ituation in the right point of view: in vain did I fly for refuge to the amu&s;ements of the place, and engage in the parties of Jack&s;on at cards, billiards, nine pins, and fives; a train of melancholy thoughts took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul, which even the conver&s;ation of Me|lopoyn could not divert. I ordered Strap to inquire every day at Banter's lodgings, in expectation of hearing again from my charmer, and my di&s;appointment con&s;iderably augmented my chagrin. My affectionate valet was in|fected with my &s;orrow, and often &s;at with me whole hours without &s;peaking, uttering &s;igh for &s;igh, and &s;hedding tear for tear. This fellow&s;hip increa&s;ed our di&s;temper; he became incapable of bu&s;ine&s;s, and was di&s;carded by his ma&s;ter; while I, &s;eeing my money melt away, without any certainty of deliverance, and, in &s;hort, all my hopes fru&s;trated, grew negligent of life, lo&s;t all appetite, and degenerated into &s;uch a &s;loven, that, during the &s;pace of two months, I was neither wa&s;hed, &s;hifted, nor &s;haved; &s;o that my face, rendered meagre with ab&s;tinence, was ob&s;cured with dirt, and over&s;hadowed with hair, and my whole appearance &s;qualid, and even frightful, when one

day Strap brought me notice, that there was a man below who wanted to &s;peak with me. Rou&s;ed at this intelli|gence, and in full hopes of receiving a letter from the dear object of my love, I ran down &s;tairs with the utmo&s;t pre|cipitation, and found, to my infinite &s;urpri&s;e, my generous uncle Mr. Bowling! Tran&s;ported at the &s;ight, I &s;prang forward to embrace him: upon which he &s;tarted a&s;ide with great agility, drew his hanger, and put him&s;elf upon his guard, crying, <Q>Ava&s;t, brother, ava&s;t! &s;heer off&mdash;Yo ho, you turnkey, why don't you keep a better look out? Here's one of your crazy pri&s;oners broke from his la&s;h|ings, I do &s;uppo&s;e.</Q> I could not help laughing heartily at his mi&s;take, which I &s;oon rectified by my voice, that he in&s;tantly recollected, and &s;hook me by the hand with great affection, te&s;tifying his concern at &s;eeing me in &s;uch a mi&s;erable condition.</P>
<P>I conducted him to my apartment, where, in pre&s;ence of Strap, whom I introduced to him as one of my be&s;t friends, he let me know, that he was ju&s;t arrived from the coa&s;t of Guinea, after having made a pretty &s;ucce&s;sful voyage, in which he had acted as mate, until the &s;hip was attacked by a French privateer; that the captain being killed during the engagement, he had taken the command, and was &s;o fortunate as to &s;ink the enemy; after which he &s;ell in with a merchant-&s;hip from Martinico, laden with &s;ugar, indigo, and &s;ome &s;ilver, and, by virtue of his let|ter of marque, attacked, took, and brought her &s;afe into Kin&s;ale in Ireland, where &s;he was condemned as a lawful prize; by which means he had not only got a pretty &s;um of money, but al&s;o acquired the favour of his owners, who had already conferred upon him the command of a large &s;hip, mounted with twenty nine-pounders, ready to &s;ail upon a very advantageous voyage, which he was not at liberty to di&s;cover; and he a&s;&s;ured me, that it was with the greate&s;t difficulty he had found me, in con&s;equence of a direction left for him at his lodgings in Wapping.</P>
<P>I was rejoiced beyond mea&s;ure at this account of his good fortune, and, at his de&s;ire, recounted all the adven|tures that had happened to me &s;ince we parted. When he under&s;tood the particulars of Strap's attachment to me, he &s;queezed his hand very cordially, and promi&s;ed to make a man of him; and, giving me ten guineas for my pre&s;ent
<PB N="213" REF="027715_0454_0FD5EF1257305EF0">
occa&s;ion, took a direction for the taylor who arre&s;ted me, and went away in order to di&s;charge the debt, telling me at parting, that he would &s;oon fetch up all my lee-way with a wet &s;ail.</P>
<P>I was utterly confounded at this &s;udden tran&s;ition, which affected me more than any rever&s;e I had formerly felt; and a crowd of incoherent ideas ru&s;hed &s;o impetu|ou&s;ly upon my imagination, that my rea&s;on could neither &s;eparate nor connect them&mdash;when Strap, who&s;e joy had manife&s;ted it&s;elf in a thou&s;and fooleries, came into my room with his &s;having uten&s;ils, and, without any previous intimation, began to lather my beard, whi&s;tling with great emotion all the while. I &s;tarted from my reverie, and, being too well acquainted with Strap to tru&s;t my&s;elf in his hands while he was under &s;uch agitation, de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, &s;ent for another barber, and &s;uffered my&s;elf to be trimmed. Having performed the ceremony of ablution, I &s;hifted, and, dre&s;&s;ing in my gaye&s;t apparel, waited for the return of my uncle, who was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed at my &s;udden transformation.</P>
<P>This beneficent kin&s;man had &s;atisfied my creditor, and obtained an order for my di&s;charge; &s;o that I was no longer a pri&s;oner; but, as I had &s;ome reluctance to part with my friends and fellows in di&s;tre&s;s, I prevailed upon Mr. Bowling to favour us with his company, and invited Mr. Melopoyn and Jack&s;on to &s;pend the evening at my apartment, where I regaled them with a &s;upper, good wine, and the news of my relea&s;e, on which they heartily congratulated me, notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;s of my compa|ny, which, they were plea&s;ed to &s;ay, they would &s;everely feel. As for Jack&s;on, his misfortune made &s;o little im|pre&s;&s;ion on him&s;elf, and he was altogether &s;o loo&s;e, indif|ferent, and indi&s;creet, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;carce pity his &s;itua|tion; but I had conceived a veneration and friend&s;hip for the poet, who was in all re&s;pects an object much more worthy of compa&s;i&s;ion and regard. When our gue&s;ts with|drew, and my uncle had retired, with an intention to vi&s;it me next morning, I made up a bundle of &s;ome linen and other nece&s;&s;aries, and, bidding Strap carry them to Mr. Melo|poyn's lodging, went thither my&s;elf, and pre&s;&s;ed it upon his acceptance, with five guineas, which with much diffi|culty he received, a&s;&s;uring me at the &s;ame time, that he
<PB N="214" REF="027715_0455_0FD5EF16F3CFD6F8">
&s;hould never have it in his power to make &s;atisfaction. I then a&s;ked if I could &s;erve him any other way? to which he an&s;wered, "You have already done too much;" and, unable to contain the emotions of his &s;oul any longer, bur&s;t into tears, and wept aloud. Moved at the &s;pectacle, I left him to his repo&s;e, and, when my uncle returned in the morning, repre&s;ented his character in &s;uch a favourable light, that the hone&s;t &s;eaman was affected with his di&s;tre&s;s, and determined to follow my example in pre&s;enting him with five pieces more: upon which, that I might &s;ave him &s;ome confu&s;ion, I advi&s;ed Mr. Bowling to inclo&s;e it in a letter, to be delivered by Strap after we &s;hould be gone.</P>
<P>This was accordingly done, I took a formal leave of all my acquaintance in the jail, and ju&s;t as I was about to &s;tep into a hackney-coach at the gate, Jack&s;on calling me, I returned, and he a&s;ked me in a whi&s;per, if I could lend him a &s;hilling? His demand being &s;o moderate, and in all likelihood the la&s;t he would make upon me, I &s;lipped a guinea into his hand, which he no &s;ooner perceived than he cried, "O Je&s;us! a guinea!" then, laying hold of a button of my coat, he broke out into an immoderate fit of laughter, and, when his convul&s;ion was ended, told me I was an hone&s;t fellow, and let me go. The coachman was ordered to drive to Mr. Bowling's lodging, where, when we arrived, he entered into a &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e with me on the &s;ubject of my &s;ituation, and he propo&s;ed, that I &s;hould &s;ail with him in quality of his &s;urgeon, in which ca&s;e he would put me in a method of getting a fortune in a few years by my own indu&s;try, and a&s;&s;ured me, that I might expect to inherit all that he &s;hould die po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, provided I &s;hould &s;urvive him. Though I was penetrated with a &s;en&s;e of his gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters">, I was &s;tartled at a propo&s;al that offered violence to my love, and &s;ignified my &s;enti|ments on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t head, which he did not &s;eem to reli&s;h, but ob&s;erved, that love was the fruit of idlene&s;s&mdash;that when once I &s;hould be employed in bu&s;ine&s;s, and my mind en|gaged in making money, I would be no more troubled with the&s;e &s;illy notions, which none but your fair-weather Jacks, who have nothing but their plea&s;ure to mind, ought to entertain. I was piqued at this in&s;inuation, which I looked upon as a reproach, and, without giving
<PB N="215" REF="027715_0456_0FD5EF19040E9AD0">
my&s;elf time to deliberate, accepted his offer. He was overjoyed at my compliance, carried me immediately to his chief owner, with whom a bargain was &s;truck, &s;o that I could not retract with honour, had I been ever &s;o much aver&s;e to the agreement. That I might not have time to cool, he bid me draw out a li&s;t of medicines, for a comple|ment of five hundred men, adapted to the di&s;tempers of hot climates, and &s;ufficient for a voyage of eigh|teen months, and carry it to a certain whole&s;ale apo|thecary, who would al&s;o provide me in two well-qualified mates. While I was thus employed, Strap came in, and looked very blank, when he under&s;tood my re&s;olution; however, after a pau&s;e of &s;ome minutes, he in&s;i&s;ted upon going along with me, and, at my de&s;ire, was made &s;hip's &s;teward by Captain Bowling, who promi&s;ed to be at the expence of fitting him out, and to lend him two hundred pounds to purcha&s;e an adventure.</P>
<P>When I had delivered my li&s;t of medicines, cho&s;en a couple of my own countrymen for mates, and be&s;poke a &s;et of chirurgical in&s;truments, my uncle told me, that by his la&s;t voyage he had cleared almo&s;t three thou&s;and pounds, one thou&s;and of which he would immediately make over, and put into my hands; that he would procure me credit to the value of as much more in &s;uch goods as would turn to be&s;t account in the country to which we were bound; and that, although he looked upon my in|tere&s;t as his own, he would keep the remaining part of his fortune in his own di&s;po&s;al, with a view of pre&s;erving his independence, and the power of puni&s;hing me, in ca&s;e I &s;hould not make a good u&s;e of what he had already be|&s;towed upon me.</P>
<P>Without troubling the reader with an account of the effect which this &s;urpri&s;ing genero&s;ity had upon my mind, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that his promi&s;es were in&s;tantly perform|ed, and an invoice of merchandi&s;e proper for the voyage pre&s;ented to me, that I might purcha&s;e the goods, and &s;hip them with all expedition. In the mid&s;t of this hurry the remembrance of my charming Narci&s;&s;a often interpo|&s;ed, and made me the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all mortals. I was di&s;tracted with the thought of being torn from her perhaps for ever; and, though the hope of &s;eeing her again might have &s;upported me under the torments of &s;e|paration,
<PB N="216" REF="027715_0457_0FD5EF19DB70DB48">
I could not reflect upon the angui&s;h &s;he mu&s;t feel at parting with me, and the ince&s;&s;ant &s;orrows to which her tender bo&s;om &s;hould be expo&s;ed during my ab|&s;ence, without being pierced with the deepe&s;t affliction! As my imagination was daily and nightly upon the rack to invent &s;ome method of mitigating this cruel &s;troke, or at lea&s;t of acquitting my love and honour in the opinion of that gentle creature, I at length &s;tumbled upon an ex|pedient, with which the reader will be made acquainted in due time, and, in con&s;equence of my determination, be|came le&s;s unea&s;y and di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>My bu&s;ine&s;s being fini&s;hed, and the &s;hip ready to &s;ail, I re&s;olved to make my la&s;t appearance among my acquaint|ance at the other end of the town, where I had not been &s;ince my impri&s;onment; and as I had, by the advice of my uncle, taken off &s;ome very rich clothes for &s;ale, I put on the gaye&s;t &s;uit in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and went in a chair to the coffee-hou&s;e I u&s;ed to frequent, where I found my friend Banter &s;o confounded at the magnificence of my dre&s;s, that, when I made up to him, he gazed at me with a look of a&s;toni&s;hment, without being able for &s;ome mi|nutes to open his lips&mdash;then pulling me a&s;ide by the &s;leeve, and fixing his eyes on mine, acco&s;ted me in this manner: <Q>Random, where the devil have you been! eh?&mdash;What is the meaning of all this finery?&mdash;Oho! I under&s;tand you&mdash;you are ju&s;t arrived from the country! What! the roads are good, eh?&mdash;Well, Random, you are a bold fellow, and a lucky fellow!&mdash;but take care; the pitcher goes often to the well, but is broke at la&s;t.</Q> So &s;ay|ing, he pointed to his collar, by which ge&s;ture, and the broken hints he had ejaculated, I found he &s;u&s;pected me of having robbed on the highway, and I laughed very heartily at his &s;uppo&s;ition. Without explaining my&s;elf any farther, I told him he was mi&s;taken in his conjecture; that I had been for &s;ome time pa&s;t with the relation of whom he had frequently heard me &s;peak, and that as I &s;hould &s;et out next day upon my travels, I had come thither to take my leave of my friends, and to receive of him the money he had borrowed from me, which, now that I was going abroad, I &s;hould have occa&s;ion for. He was a little di&s;concerted at this demand, but, recollecting him&s;elf in a moment, &s;wore in an affected pa&s;&s;ion, that I had u&s;ed
<PB N="217" REF="027715_0458_0FD5EF1C44271858">
him extremely ill, and he would never forgive me for having, by this &s;hort warning, put it out of his power to free him&s;elf of an obligation he could no longer bear. I could not help &s;miling at this pretended delicacy, which I commended highly, telling him he needed not be unea&s;y on that &s;core; for I would give him a direction to a mer|chant in the city, with whom I would leave a di&s;charge for the &s;um, to be delivered on payment. He profe&s;&s;ed much joy at this expedient, and with great eagerne&s;s a&s;ked the per&s;on's name and place of abode, which he forthwith wrote in his pocket-book, a&s;&s;uring me, that he &s;hould not be long in my debt. This affair, which I knew he would never after think of, being &s;ettled to his &s;atisfaction, I &s;ent cards to all my friends, de&s;iring the favour of their company at a tavern in the evening, when they honoured my invitation, and I had the plea&s;ure of treating them in a very elegant manner, at which they expre&s;&s;ed as much admiration as applau&s;e. Having enjoyed our&s;elves till midnight, I took my leave of them all, being well nigh &s;tifled with care&s;&s;es; and next day I &s;et out with Strap in a po&s;t-chai&s;e for Grave&s;end, where we went on board, and, the wind &s;erving, weighed anchor in le&s;s than twelve hours. Without meeting with any accident, we got as far as the Downs, where we were obliged to come to an anchor, and wait for an ea&s;terly wind to carry us out of the channel.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was now I put in execution the &s;cheme I had project|ed at London; and a&s;king leave of the captain for Strap and me to &s;tay on &s;hore till the wind &s;hould become favourable, my reque&s;t was granted, becau&s;e he had or|ders
<PB N="218" REF="027715_0459_0FD5CD9A673049A0">
to remain in the Downs until he &s;hould receive &s;ome di&s;patches from London, which he did not expect in le&s;s than a week. Having imparted my re&s;olution to my tru&s;ty valet, who (though he endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade me from &s;uch a ra&s;h undertaking) would not quit me in the enter|pri&s;e, I hired hor&s;es, and &s;et out immediately for that part of Su&s;&s;ex where my charmer was confined, which was not above thirty miles di&s;tant from Deal, where we mounted. As I was perfectly well acquainted with the extent of the &s;quire's e&s;tate and influence, I halted within five miles of his hou&s;e, where we remained till the twilight, at which time we &s;et forward, and, by the favour of a dark night, gained a cop&s;e about half a mile from the village where Mrs. Sagely lived. Here we left our hor&s;es tied to a tree, and went directly to the hou&s;e of my old benefactre&s;s, Strap trembling all the way, and venting ejaculatory pe|titions to Heaven for our &s;afety. Her habitation being quite &s;olitary, we arrived at the door without being ob|&s;erved, when I ordered my companion to enter by him&s;elf, and, in ca&s;e there &s;hould be company with her, deliver a letter which I had wrote for that purpo&s;e, and &s;ay that a friend of her's in London, under&s;tanding that he intended to travel this road, had committed it to his care. He rap|ped at the door, to which the good old woman coming, told him, that, being a lone woman, he mu&s;t excu&s;e her if &s;he did not open it until he had declared his name and bu&s;ine&s;s. He an&s;wered, that his name was unknown to her, and that his bu&s;ine&s;s was to deliver a letter, which (to free her from al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> manner of apprehen&s;ion) he would convey to her through the &s;pace between the door and the thre&s;hold. This he in&s;tantly performed; and &s;he no &s;ooner read the contents, which &s;pecified my being pre&s;ent, than &s;he cried, <Q>If the per&s;on who wrote this letter be at hand, let him &s;peak, that I may be a&s;&s;ured by his voice whe|ther or not I may &s;afely admit him.</Q> I forthwith ap|plied my mouth to the key-hole, and pronounced, <Q>Dear mother, you need not be afraid; it is I, &s;o much in|debted to your goodne&s;s, who now crave admittance.</Q> She knew my voice, and, opening the door immediately, received me with a truly maternal affection, manife&s;ting, by the tears &s;he let fall, her concern le&s;t I &s;hould be di&s;|covered; for &s;he had been informed of every thing that
<PB N="219" REF="027715_0460_0FD5EF22D75246A0">
had happened between Narci&s;&s;a and me from the dear cap|tive's own mouth. When I explained the motive of my journey, which was no other than a de&s;ire of &s;eeing the object of my love before I &s;hould quit the kingdom, that I might in per&s;on convince her of the nece&s;&s;ity I was under to leave her, reconcile her to that event by de&s;cribing the advantages that in all probability would attend it, repeat my vows of eternal con&s;tancy, and enjoy the melancholy plea&s;ure of a tender embrace at parting&mdash;I &s;ay, when I had thus &s;ignified my intention, Mrs. Sagely told me, that Narci&s;&s;a, upon her return from Bath, had been &s;o &s;trictly watched, that nobody but one or two of the &s;ervants de|voted to her brother, were admitted to her pre&s;ence; that afterwards &s;he had been a little enlarged, and was permit|ted to &s;ee company, during which indulgence &s;he had been &s;everal times at her cottage; but of late &s;he had been be|trayed by one of the &s;ervants, who di&s;covered to the &s;quire, that he had once carried a letter from her to the po&s;t-hou&s;e directed to me; upon which information &s;he was now more confined than ever; and that I could have no chance of &s;eeing her, unle&s;s I would run the ri&s;k of getting into the garden, where &s;he and her maid were every day allowed to take the air, and lie hid until I &s;hould have an opportunity of &s;peaking to them&mdash;an ad|venture which would be attended with &s;uch danger, that no man in his right wits would attempt it. This enter|prize, hazardous as it was, I re&s;olved to perform, in &s;pite of all the arguments of Mrs. Sagely, who rea&s;oned, chid, and entreated by turns, and the tears and prayers of Strap, who conjured me on his knees to have more regard to my&s;elf, as well as to him, than to tempt my own de|&s;truction in &s;uch a precipitate manner. I was deaf to every thing but the &s;ugge&s;tions of my love, and ordered him to return immediately with the hor&s;es to the inn from whence we &s;et out, and wait for my coming in that place: he at fir&s;t peremptorily refu&s;ed to leave me, until I per|&s;uaded him, that, if our hor&s;es &s;hould remain where they were till day-light, they would certainly be di&s;covered, and the whole country alarmed. On this con&s;ideration he took leave of me in a &s;orrowful plight, ki&s;&s;ed my hand, and, weeping, cried, <Q>God knows if ever I &s;hall &s;ee you again.</Q> My kind landlady, finding me ob&s;tinate, gave
<PB N="220" REF="027715_0461_0FD5EF251FBF2AB0">
me her be&s;t advice how to behave in the execution of my project, and, after having per&s;uaded me to take a little refre&s;hment, accommodated me with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and left me to my repo&s;e. Early in the morning I got up, and, armed with a couple of loaded pi&s;tols and a hanger, went to the back of the &s;quire's garden, climbed over the wall, and, according to Mrs. Sagely's direction, con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">aled my&s;elf in a thicket hard by an alcove which terminated a walk at a good di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, which (I was told) my mi&s;tre&s;s chiefly frequented. Here I remained from five o'clock in the morning to &s;ix in the evening, without &s;ee|ing a human creature; at la&s;t I perceived two women ap|proaching, whom by my throbbing heart I &s;oon recogni|zed to be the adorable Narci&s;&s;a and Mi&s;s Williams. I felt the &s;tronge&s;t agitation of &s;oul at the &s;ight, and, gue&s;&s;ing that they would repo&s;e them&s;elves in the alcove, I &s;tepped into it unperceived, and laid upon the &s;tone-table a picture of my&s;elf in miniature, for which I had &s;at in London, purpo&s;ing to leave it with Narci&s;&s;a before I &s;hould go abroad. I expo&s;ed it in this manner as an introduction to my own appearance, which, without &s;ome previous inti|mation, I was afraid might have an unlucky effect upon the delicate nerves of my fair en&s;laver, and then withdrew into the thicket, where I could hear their di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;uit my&s;elf to the circum&s;tances of the occa&s;ion. As they advanced, I ob&s;erved an air of melancholy in the counte|nance of Narci&s;&s;a, blended with &s;uch un&s;peakable &s;weet|ne&s;s, that I could &s;carce refrain from flying into her arms, and ki&s;&s;ing away the pearly drop that &s;tood collected in each bewitching eye. According to my expectation, &s;he entered the alcove, and, perceiving &s;omething on the ta|ble, took it up. No &s;ooner did &s;he ca&s;t her eye upon the features than, &s;tartled at the re&s;emblance, &s;he cried, "Gracious God!" and the ro&s;es in&s;tantly vani&s;hed from her cheeks. Her confidante, alarmed at this exclamation, looked at the picture, and, &s;truck with the likene&s;s, ex|claimed, "O Je&s;us! the very features of Mr. Random! Narci&s;&s;a having recollected her&s;elf a little, &s;aid, <Q>What|ever angel brought it hither as a comfort to me in my affliction, I am thankful for the benefit, and will pre|&s;erve it as the deare&s;t object of my care.</Q> So &s;aying, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed it with &s;urpri&s;ing ardour, &s;hed a flood of tears,

The gentle Narci&s;&s;a, &s;tarting at this conjecture, an&s;wered, <Q>Heaven forbid! for, although nothing in the univer&s;e could yield me &s;atisfaction equal to that of his pre&s;ence for one poor moment in a proper place, I would rather forfeit his company&mdash;almo&s;t for ever, than &s;ee him here, where his life would be expo&s;ed to &s;o much danger.</Q> I could no longer re&s;train the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of my pa&s;&s;ion, but, breaking from my concealment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> before her, when &s;he uttered a fearful &s;hriek, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> away in the arms of her companion.

<P>I am afraid I have already encroached upon the rea|der's patience, with the particulars of this amour, on which, (I own,) I cannot help being impertinently cir|cum&s;tantial. I &s;hall therefore omit the le&s;s material pa&s;|&s;ages of this interview, during which I convinced her rea|&s;on, though I could not appea&s;e the &s;ad pre&s;ages of her love, with regard to the long voyage and dangers I mu&s;t undergo.&mdash;When we had &s;pent an hour, (which was all &s;he could &s;pare from the barbarity of her brother's vigi|lance,) in lamenting over our hard fate, and in repeating our reciprocal vows, Mi&s;s Williams reminded us of the nece&s;&s;ity there was for our immediate parting; and &s;ure, lovers never parted with &s;uch &s;orrow and reluctance as we. But becau&s;e my words are incapable of doing ju&s;tice to that affecting circum&s;tance, I am obliged to draw a veil over it, and ob&s;erve, that I returned in the dark to the hou&s;e of Mrs. Sagely, who was overjoyed to hear of my &s;ucce&s;s, and oppo&s;ed the tumults of my grief with &s;uch

&s;trength of rea&s;on, that my mind regained in &s;ome mea|&s;ure its tranquility; and that very night, after having forced upon this good gentlewoman a pur&s;e of twenty guineas, as a token of my gratitude and e&s;teem, I took leave of her, &s;et out on foot for the inn, where my arrival freed hone&s;t Strap from the horrors of unutterable dread.</P>
<P>We took hor&s;e immediately, and alighted early next morning at Deal, where I found my uncle in great con|cern on account of my ab&s;ence, becau&s;e he had received his di&s;patches, and mu&s;t have weighed with the fir&s;t fair wind, whether I had been on board or not.&mdash;Next day a bri&s;k ea&s;terly gale &s;pringing up, we &s;et &s;ail, and in eight and forty hours got clear of the channel.</P>
<P>When we were about 200 leagues from the Land's-end, the captain taking me apart into his cabin, told me, that, now he was permitted by his in&s;tructions, he would di&s;|clo&s;e the intent and de&s;tination of our voyage: <Q>The &s;hip,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>which has been fitted out at a great expence, is bound for the coa&s;t of Guinea, where we &s;hall exchange part of our cargo for &s;laves and gold du&s;t; from thence we will tran&s;port our negroes to Buenos Ayres in New-Spain, where, (by virtue of pa&s;&s;ports obtained from our own court, and that of Ma|drid,) we will di&s;po&s;e of them and the goods that re|main on board for &s;ilver, by means of our &s;upercargo, who is perfectly well acquainted with the coa&s;t, the lingo and inhabitants.</Q>&mdash;Being thus let into the &s;ecret of our expedition, I borrowed of the &s;upercargo a Spa|ni&s;h grammar, dictionary, and &s;ome other books of the &s;ame language, which I &s;tudied with &s;uch application, that before we arrived in New-Spain, I could maintain a conver&s;ation with him in that tongue.&mdash;Being arrived in the warm latitudes, I ordered, (with the captain's con|&s;ent,) the whole &s;hip's company to be blooded and pur|ged, my&s;elf undergoing the &s;ame evacuation, in order to prevent tho&s;e dangerous fevers, to which northern con&s;ti|tutions are &s;ubject in hot climates; and I have rea&s;on to believe that this precaution was not un&s;erviceable, for we lo&s;t but one &s;ailor during our whole pa&s;&s;age to the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>One day, when we had been about five weeks at &s;ea, we de&s;cried to windward a large &s;hip bearing down upon us with all the &s;ail &s;he could carry. Upon which my un|cle
<PB N="223" REF="027715_0464_0FD5EF2BD9C8F3C0">
ordered the &s;tudding-&s;ails to be hoi&s;ted, and the &s;hip to be cleared for engaging; but finding, that (to u&s;e the &s;eaman's phra&s;e) we were very much wronged by the &s;hip that had us in cha&s;e, and which by this time had hoi&s;ted French colours, he commanded the &s;tudding-&s;ails to be taken in, the cour&s;es to be clewed up, the main top-&s;ail to be backed, the tompions to be taken out of the guns, and every man to repair to his quarters. While every body was bu&s;ied in the performance of the&s;e orders, Strap came upon the quarter-deck, trembling, and looking agha&s;t, and, with a voice half &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by fear, a&s;ked if I thought we were a match for the ve&s;&s;el in pur&s;uit of us. Ob&s;erving his con&s;ternation, I &s;aid, <Q>What? are you afraid, Strap? Afraid!</Q> he replied, <Q>n-n-no, what &s;hould I be afraid of? I thank God I have a clear con|&s;cience;&mdash;but I believe it will be a bloody battle, and I wi&s;h you may not have occa&s;ion for another hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in the cock-pit.</Q>&mdash;I immediately perceived his drift, and making the captain acquainted with his &s;ituation, de&s;ired he might be &s;tationed below with me and my mates. My uncle, incen&s;ed at his pu&s;illanimity, bid me &s;end him down in&s;tantly, that his fear might not infect the &s;hip's company: whereupon I told the poor &s;teward, that I had begged him for an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, and de|&s;ired him to go down, and help my mates to get ready the in&s;truments and dre&s;&s;ings.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding the &s;atisfac|tion he mu&s;t have felt at the&s;e tidings, he affected a &s;hy|ne&s;s of quitting the upper-deck; and &s;aid, he hoped I did not imagine he was afraid to do his duty above board, for he believed him&s;elf as well prepared for death as any man in the &s;hip, no di&s;paragement to me or the captain.&mdash;I was di&s;gu&s;ted at this affectation, and, in order to puni&s;h his hypocri&s;y, a&s;&s;ured him he might take his choice either of going down to the cock-pit with me, or of &s;taying upon deck during the engagement. Alarmed at this indiffer|ence, he replied, <Q>Well, to oblige you, I'll go down, but remember it is more for your &s;ake than my own.</Q> So &s;aying, he di&s;appeared in a twinkling, without wait|ing for an an&s;wer.&mdash;By this time we could ob&s;erve two tier of guns in the &s;hip which pur&s;ued us, and which was now but two &s;hort miles a&s;tern. This di&s;covery had an evident effect upon the &s;ailors, who did not &s;cruple to &s;ay,
<PB N="224" REF="027715_0465_0FD5EF2DD630C940">
that we &s;hould be torn to pieces, and blown out of the water, and that if in ca&s;e any of them &s;hould lo&s;e their precious limbs, they mu&s;t go a begging for life, for there was no provi&s;ion made by the merchants for tho&s;e poor &s;ouls who are maimed in their &s;ervice. The captain un|der&s;tanding this backwardne&s;s, ordered the crew abaft, and &s;poke to them thus: <Q>My lads I am told you hang an a&mdash;&s;e.&mdash;I have gone to &s;ea thirty years, man and boy, and never &s;aw Engli&s;h &s;ailors afraid before.&mdash;Mayhap you think I want to expo&s;e you for the lucre of gain.&mdash;Who&s;oever thinks &s;o, thinks a damned lie, for my whole cargo is in&s;ured; &s;o that in ca&s;e I &s;hould be taken, my lo&s;s will not be great.&mdash;The enemy is &s;tronger than we, to be &s;ure&mdash;What then? have we not a chance for carrying away one of her ma&s;ts, and &s;o get clear of her?&mdash;If we find her too hard for us, 'tis but &s;triking at la&s;t.&mdash;If any man is hurt in the engage|ment, I promi&s;e, on the word of an hone&s;t &s;eaman, to make him a recompence, according to his lo&s;s.&mdash;So now, you that are lazy, lubberly, cowardly dogs, get away, and &s;culk in the hold and bread-room; and you that are jolly boys, &s;tand by me, and let us give one broad-&s;ide for the honour of old England.</Q> This elo|quent harangue was &s;o well adapted to the di&s;po&s;ition of his hearers, that one and all of them, pulling off their hats, waved them over their heads, and &s;aluted him with three cheers: upon which he &s;ent his boy for two large ca&s;e bottles of brandy, and having treated every man with a dram, they repaired to their quarters, and waited im|patiently for the word of command.&mdash;I mu&s;t do my uncle the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that in the whole of his di&s;po&s;ition, he behaved with the utmo&s;t intrepidity, conduct, and deli|beration.&mdash;The enemy being very near, he ordered me to my &s;tation, and was ju&s;t going to give the word for hoi&s;t|ing the colours, and firing, when the &s;uppo&s;ed French|man hauled down his white pennant, jack, and en&s;ign, hoi&s;ted Engli&s;h ones, and fired a gun a head of us: this was a joyful event to Captain Bowling, who immediately &s;hewed his colours, and fired a gun to leeward: upon which the other &s;hip ran along-&s;ide of him, hailed him, and giving him to know, that &s;he was an Engli&s;h man of war of forty guns, ordered him to hoi&s;t out his boat, and

<ARGUMENT>
<P>I am invited to the villa of a Spani&s;h don, where we meet with an Engli&s;h gentleman, and make a very intere&s;ting di&s;covery&mdash;we leave Buenos Ayres, and arrive at Ja|maica.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OUR &s;hip being freed from the di&s;agreeable lading of Negroes, to whom, indeed, I had been a mi&s;erable &s;lave, &s;ince our leaving the coa&s;t of Guinea, I began to enjoy my&s;elf and breathe with plea&s;ure the air of Para|guay; this part of which is reckoned the Montpelier of South America, and has obtained, on account of its cli|mate, the name of Buenos Ayres.&mdash;It was in this delici|ous place that I gave my&s;elf entirely up to the thoughts of my dear Narci&s;&s;a, who&s;e image &s;till kept full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my brea&s;t, and who&s;e charms, enhanced by ab&s;ence, appeared to my imagination, if po&s;&s;ible, more engaging than ever! I calculated the profits of my voyage, which even exceeded my expectation; re&s;olved to purcha&s;e a hand&s;ome &s;inecure upon my arrival in England, and if I &s;hould find the &s;quire as aver&s;e to me as ever, marry his &s;i&s;ter by &s;tealth; and, in ca&s;e our family &s;hould increa&s;e, rely upon the genero&s;ity of my uncle, who was by this time worth a con&s;iderable &s;um.</P>
<P>While I amu&s;ed my&s;elf with the&s;e agreeable projects, and the tran&s;porting hopes of enjoying Narci&s;&s;a, we were very much care&s;&s;ed by the Spani&s;h gentlemen, who fre|quently formed parties of plea&s;ure for our entertainment, in which we made excur&s;ions a good way into the coun|try. Among tho&s;e who &s;ignalized them&s;elves by their civility to us, there was one Don Antonio de Ribera, a very polite young gentleman, with whom I had contract|ed an intimate friend&s;hip, who invited us one day to his country hou&s;e, and, as a further inducement to our com|pliance, promi&s;ed to procure for us the company of an Engli&s;h &s;ignor, who had been &s;ettled in tho&s;e parts many years, and acquired the love and e&s;teem of the whole pro|vince, by his affability, good &s;en&s;e, and honourable be|haviour.</P>
<P>We accepted his invitation, and &s;et out for his Villa,
<PB N="227" REF="027715_0468_0FD5EF38B70F0438">
where we had not been longer than an hour, when the per&s;on arrived, in who&s;e favour I had been &s;o much pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.&mdash;He was a tall man, remarkably well &s;haped, of a fine mien and appearance, commanding re&s;pect, and &s;eemed to be turned of forty; the features of his face were &s;addened with a re&s;erve and gravity, which in other countries would have been thought the effect of melancholy; but here, appeared to have been contracted by his commerce with the Spaniards, who are remarkable for that &s;everity of countenance. Under&s;tanding from Don Antonio that we were his countrymen, he &s;aluted us all round very com|plai&s;antly, and fixing his eyes attentively on me, uttered a deep &s;igh.&mdash;I had been &s;truck with a profound venera|tion for him at his fir&s;t coming into the room; and no &s;ooner ob&s;erved this expre&s;&s;ion of &s;orrow, directed, as it were, in a particular manner to me, than my heart took part in his grief; I &s;ympathized involuntarily, and &s;igh|ed in my turn. Having a&s;ked leave of our entertainer, he acco&s;ted us in Engli&s;h, profe&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing &s;o many of his countrymen in &s;uch a remote place, and a&s;ked the captain, who went by the name of Signor Tho|ma, from what part of Britain he &s;ailed, and whither he was bound.&mdash;My uncle told him that we had &s;ailed from the river Thames, and were bound for the &s;ame place, by the way of Jamaica, where he intended to take in a lading of &s;ugar.</P>
<P>Having &s;atisfied him&s;elf in the&s;e and other particulars about the &s;tate of the war, he gave us to under&s;tand, that he had a longing de&s;ire to revi&s;it his native country, in con&s;equence of which he had already tran&s;mitted to Eu|rope the greate&s;t part of his fortune in neutral bottoms, and would willingly embark the re&s;t of it with him&s;elf in our &s;hip, provided the captain had no objection to &s;uch a pa&s;&s;enger.&mdash;My uncle very prudently replied, that for his part, he &s;hould be glad of his company, if he could pro|cure the con&s;ent of the governor, without which he dur&s;t not admit him on board, whatever inclination he had to oblige him.&mdash;The gentleman approved of his di&s;cretion, and telling him, that there would be no difficulty in ob|taining the connivance of the governor, who was his good friend, &s;hifted the conver&s;ation to another &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I was overjoyed to hear his intention, and already in|tere&s;ted
<PB N="228" REF="027715_0469_0FD5EF3A548D0838">
my&s;elf &s;o much in his favour, that had he been di&s;appointed, I &s;hould have been very unhappy; in the cour&s;e of our entertainment, he eyed me with an uncom|mon attachment; I felt a &s;urpri&s;ing attraction towards him; when he &s;poke, I li&s;tened with attention and reve|rence; the dignity of his deportment filled me with af|fection and awe; and, in &s;hort, the emotions of my &s;oul, in the pre&s;ence of this &s;tranger, were &s;trong and unac|countable.</P>
<P>Having &s;pent the be&s;t part of the day with us, he took his leave, telling Captain Thoma, that he &s;hould hear from him in a &s;hort time. He was no &s;ooner gone, than I a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions about him of Don Antonio&punc; who could give me no other &s;atisfaction, than that his name was Don Rodrigo, that he had lived fifteen or &s;ix|teen years in the&s;e parts, was reputed rich, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have been unfortunate in his younger years, becau&s;e he was ob&s;erved to nouri&s;h a pen&s;ive melancholy, even from the time of his fir&s;t &s;ettlement among them; but that no body had ventured to enquire into the cau&s;e of his &s;orrow, in con&s;ideration of his peace, which might &s;uffer in the recapitulation of his misfortunes.</P>
<P>I was &s;eized with an irre&s;i&s;tible de&s;ire of knowing the particulars of his fate, and enjoyed not an hour of repo&s;e during the whole night, by rea&s;on of the eager concep|tions that in&s;pired me, with regard to his &s;tory, which I re&s;olved (if po&s;&s;ible) to learn.&mdash;Next morning, while we were at breakfa&s;t, three mules, richly capari&s;oned, arrived, with a me&s;&s;age from Don Rodrigo, de&s;iring our com|pany and that of Don Antonio at his hou&s;e, which was &s;ituated about ten miles further up the country.&mdash;I was plea&s;ed with this invitation, in con&s;equence of which we mounted the mules which he had provided for us, and alighted at his hou&s;e before noon.&mdash;Here we were &s;plen|didly entertained by the generous &s;tranger, who &s;till &s;eem|ed to &s;hew a particular regard for me, and after dinner made me a pre&s;ent of a ring &s;et with a beautiful amethy&s;t, the production of that country, &s;aying, at the &s;ame time, that he was once ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;on, who, had he lived, would have been nearly of my age. This ob&s;ervation, delivered with a profound &s;igh, made my heart throb with violence; a crowd of confu&s;ed ideas ru&s;hed upon my ima|gination;
<PB N="229" REF="027715_0470_0FD5EF3CAA5CD940">
which while I endeavoured to unravel, my un|cle perceived my ab&s;ence of thought, and, tapping me on the &s;houlder, &s;aid, "Oons! are you a&s;leep, Rory!" Be|fore I had time to reply, Don Rodrigo, with an un|common eagerne&s;s of voice and look, pronounced, <Q>Pray, captain, what is the young gentleman's name?</Q>&mdash;"His name," &s;aid my uncle, "is Roderick Random."&mdash;"Gracious powers!" cried the &s;tranger, &s;tarting up,&mdash;"And his mother's?" "His mother," an&s;wered the captain, amazed, "was called Charlotte Bowling."&mdash;"O bounteous Heaven!" exclaimed Don Rodrigo, &s;pringing acro&s;s the table, and cla&s;ping me in his arms, <Q>my &s;on! my &s;on! have I found thee again? Do I hold thee in my embrace, after having lo&s;t and de&s;paired of &s;eeing thee &s;o long?</Q> So &s;aying, he &s;ell upon my neck, and wept aloud with joy; while the power of nature operat|ing &s;trongly in my brea&s;t, I was lo&s;t in rapture, and while he pre&s;&s;ed me to his heart, let fall a &s;hower of tears in his bo&s;om. His utterance was choaked up a good while, by the agitation of his &s;oul; at length he broke out into, <Q>My&s;terious Providence!&mdash;O my dear Charlotte! there yet remains a pledge of our love! and &s;uch a pledge&mdash;&s;o found!&mdash;O infinite goodne&s;s! let me adore thy all|wi&s;e decrees!</Q> Having thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, he kneeled upon the floor, li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ted up his eyes and hands to heaven, and remained &s;ome minutes in a &s;ilent exta&s;y of devotion: I put my&s;elf in the &s;ame po&s;ture, adored the all-good Di&s;po&s;er in a prayer of mental thank&s;giving; and, when his ejaculation was ended, did homage to my father, and craved his parental ble&s;&s;ing. He hugged me again with unutterable fondne&s;s, and having implored the pro|tection of heaven upon my head, rai&s;ed me from the ground, and pre&s;ented me as his &s;on to the company, who wept in concert over this affecting &s;core.&mdash;Among the re&s;t my uncle did not fail of di&s;covering the goodne&s;s and joy of his heart: <HI>Albeit unu&s;ed to the melting mood,</HI> he blubbered with great tenderne&s;s, and wringing my father's hand, he cried, <Q>Brother Random, I am rejoiced to &s;ee you&mdash;God be prai&s;ed for this happy meeting.</Q>&mdash;Don Rodrigo, under&s;tanding that he was his brother-in-law, embraced him affectionately, &s;aying, <Q>Are you my Char|lotte's brother?&mdash;Alas! unhappy Charlotte!

<P>While he di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers to the gentlemen in the neighbourhood, to announce this event, and gave orders for a grand entertainment, I was &s;o much affected with the tumults of pa&s;&s;ion which a&s;&s;ailed me on this great, &s;ud|den, and unexpected occa&s;ion, that I fell &s;ick, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">evered, and, in le&s;s than three hours, became quite delirious; &s;o that the preparations were countermanded, and the joy of the family converted into grief and de&s;pair.&mdash;Phy&s;icians were in&s;antly called, I was plentifully blooded in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oot, my lower extremities were bathed in a decoction of &s;alu|tiferous herbs; in ten hours after I was taken ill, I en|joyed a critical &s;weat, and next day felt no remains of the di&s;temper, but an agreeable la&s;&s;itude, which did not hin|der me from getting up.&mdash;During the progre&s;s of this &s;e|ver, which, from the term of its duration, is called <HI>Ephe|mera,</HI> my father never once quitted my bed &s;ide, but ad|mini&s;tered the pre&s;criptions of the phy&s;icians, with the mo&s;t pious care; while Captain Bowling manife&s;ted his concern by the like attendance.&mdash;I no &s;ooner found my|&s;elf delivered from the di&s;ea&s;e, than I bethought my&s;elf of my hone&s;t friend Strap; and re&s;olving to make him happy forthwith, in the knowledge of my good fortune, told my father; in general, that I had been infinitely ob|liged to this faithful adherent; and begged he would in|dulge me &s;o far as to &s;end for him, without letting him know my happine&s;s, until he could receive an account of it from my own mouth.</P>
<P>My reque&s;t was in&s;tantly complied with, and a me&s;&s;en|ger, with a &s;pare mule, detached to the &s;hip, carrying or|ders from the captain to the mate to &s;end the &s;teward by the bearer.

to which &s;he was entitled by her birth and qualifications. Having often mentioned her name while I was deprived of my &s;en&s;es, my father gue&s;&s;ed, that there was an intimate connection between us, and, di&s;covering the picture which hung in my bo&s;om by a ribbon, did not doubt that it was the re&s;emblance of my amiable mi&s;tre&s;s: in this belief he was confirmed by my uncle, who told him it was the pic|ture of a young woman to whom I was under promi&s;e of marriage. Alarmed at this piece of information, Don Rodrigo took the fir&s;t opportunity of que&s;tioning me about the circum&s;tances of this affair, which, when I had candidly recounted, he approved of my pa&s;&s;ion, and pro|mi&s;ed to contribute all in his power towards its &s;ucce&s;s: though I never doubted his genero&s;ity, I was tran&s;ported on this occa&s;ion, and, throwing my&s;elf at his feet, told him, he had now completed my happine&s;s; for, without the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Narci&s;&s;a, I &s;hould be mi&s;erable among all the plea&s;ures of life. He rai&s;ed me with a &s;mile of pater|nal fondne&s;s, &s;aid, he knew what it was to be in love, and ob&s;erved, that, if he had been as tenderly beloved by his father as I was by mine, he would not now perhaps have cau&s;e.&mdash;Here he was interrupted by a &s;igh, the tears &s;tood collected in his eyes, he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the dictates of his grief, and, the time being opportune, de&s;ired me to relate the pa&s;&s;ages of my life, which my uncle had told him were manifold and &s;urpri&s;ing.

<P>When I had thus &s;atisfied his curio&s;ity, I di&s;covered an inclination to hear the particulars of his &s;tory, which he gratified by beginning with his marriage, and proceeded to the day of his di&s;appearing, as I have related in the fir&s;t part of my memoirs.

lo&s;t through the barbarity of an unnatural parent, I took my leave of you, my child, then an infant, with an heart full of unutterable woe, but little &s;u&s;pecting, that my father's unkindne&s;s would have de&s;cended to my innocent orphan; and, &s;etting out alone at mid|night for the neare&s;t &s;ea-port, early next morning got on board a &s;hip, bound (as I heard) for France, and, bargaining with the ma&s;ter for my pa&s;&s;age, bid a long adieu to my native country, and put to &s;ea with the fir&s;t fair wind. The place of our de&s;tination was Gran|ville; but we had the misfortune to run upon a ridge of rocks near the i&s;land of Alderney, called the Ca&s;kets, where the &s;ea running high, the &s;hip went to pieces, the boat &s;unk along-&s;ide, and every &s;oul on board pe|ri&s;hed except my&s;elf, who by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a grating got a&s;hore on the coa&s;t of Normandy: I went directly to Caen, where I was &s;o lucky as to meet with a count whom I had formerly known in my travels: with this gentleman I &s;et out for Paris, where I was recommend|ed, by him and other friends, as tutor to a young no|bleman, whom I accompanied to the court of Spain.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I INQUIRED, as &s;oon as I got a&s;hore, about my gene|rous companion Mr. Thom&s;on, and hearing that he liv|ed in a flouri&s;hing condition upon the e&s;tate left to him by

his wife's father, who had been dead &s;ome years, I took hor&s;e immediately, with the con&s;ent of Don Rodrigo, who had heard me mention him with great regard, and in a few hours reached the place of his habitation.</P>
<P>I &s;hould much wrong the delicacy of Mr. Thom&s;on's &s;entiments to &s;ay barely, he was glad to &s;ee me: he felt all that the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip could feel on this occa&s;ion, introduced me to his wife, a very amiable young lady, who had already ble&s;&s;ed him with two fine children; and, being as yet ignorant of my cir|cum&s;tances, frankly offered me the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his pur&s;e and intere&s;t. I thanked him for his generous intention, and made him acquainted with my &s;ituation, on which he congratulated me with great joy, and, after I had &s;taid with him a whole day and night, accompanied me back to King&s;ton to wait upon my father, whom he invited to his hou&s;e: Don Rodrigo complied with his reque&s;t, and, having been hand&s;omely entertained during the &s;pace of a week, returned extremely well &s;atisfied with the be|haviour of my friend and his lady, to whom at parting, he pre&s;ented a very valuable diamond ring as a token of his e&s;teem. During the cour&s;e of my conver&s;ation with Mr. Thom&s;on, he let me know, that his and my old commander, Captain Oakhum, was dead &s;ome months, and that, im|mediately after his death, a di&s;covery had been made of &s;ome valuable effects that he had feloniou&s;ly &s;ecreted out of a prize by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Dr. Mac&s;hane, who was now actually in pri&s;on on that account, and, being de&s;ti|tute of friends, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;olely on the charity of my friend, who&s;e bounty he had implored in the mo&s;t abject manner, after having been the barbarous occa&s;ion of driving him to that terrible extremity on board the Thunder, which I have formerly related. What&s;oever this wretch might have been guilty of, I applauded Mr. Thom&s;on's genero|&s;ity towards him in his di&s;tre&s;s, which wrought &s;o much upon me al&s;o, that I &s;ent him ten pi&s;toles, in &s;uch a private manner that he could never know his benefactor.</P>
<P>While my father and I were care&s;&s;ed among the gentle|men on &s;hore, Captain Bowling had wrote to his owners by the packet, which &s;ailed a few days after our arrival, &s;ignifying his pro&s;perous voyage hitherto, and de&s;iring them to in&s;ure his &s;hip and cargo homeward bound; after

which he applied him&s;elf &s;o heartily to the loading his &s;hip, that, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Thom&s;on, &s;he was full in le&s;s than &s;ix weeks. This kind gentleman likewi&s;e procured for Don Rodrigo bills upon London for the greate&s;t part of his gold and &s;ilver, by which means it was &s;ecured again&s;t the ri&s;k of the &s;eas and the enemy; and, before we &s;ailed, &s;upplied us with &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch large quantities of all kinds of &s;tock, that not only we, but the whole &s;hip's company, fared &s;umptuou&s;ly during the voyage.</P>
<P>Every thing being ready, we took our leave of our kind entertainers, and going on board at Port Royal, &s;et &s;ail for England on the fir&s;t of June.&mdash;We beat up to wind|ward, with fine ea&s;y weather; and one night believing our&s;elves near Cape Tiberoon, lay to, with an intention to wood and water next morning in the bay: while we remained in this &s;ituation, a &s;ailor having drank more new rum than he could carry, &s;taggered overboard, and, not|with&s;tanding all the means that could be u&s;ed to pre&s;erve him, went to the bottom, and di&s;appeared. About two hours after this melancholy accident happened, as I en|joyed the cool air on the quarter-deck, I heard a voice ri&s;ing, as it were, out of the &s;ea, and calling, <Q>Ho, the &s;hip, a hoy!</Q> Upon which one of the men upon the foreca&s;tle cried, <Q>I'll be d&mdash;d'd, if that an't Jack Mar|lin&s;pike, who went overboard!</Q> Not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at this event, I jumped into the boat that lay along-&s;ide, with the &s;econd mate and four men, and rowing towards the place, from whence the voice (which repeated the hail,) &s;eemed to proceed, we perceived &s;omething floating upon the water; when we had rowed a little farther, we di&s;cerned it to be a man riding upon a hen-coop, who, &s;ee|ing us approach, pronounced with a hoar&s;e voice, <Q>D&mdash;n your bloods! why did you not an&s;wer when I hailed?</Q> Our mate, who was a veritable &s;eaman, hearing this &s;a|lute, &s;aid, <Q>By G&mdash;d, my lads, this is none of our man&mdash;This is the devil&mdash;pull away for the &s;hip.</Q> The fel|lows obeyed his command without que&s;tion, and were al|ready &s;ome fathoms on our return, when I in&s;i&s;ted on their taking up the poor creature, and prevailed upon them to go back to the wreck, which, when we came near the &s;e|cond time, and &s;ignified our intention, we received an an|&s;wer of, "Ava&s;t, ava&s;t&mdash;what &s;hip, brother?" Being &s;a|tisfied
<PB N="237" REF="027715_0478_0FD5EF4F35DB4AE0">
in this particular, he cried, <Q>D&mdash;n the &s;hip, I was in hopes it had been my own&mdash;where are you bound?</Q> We gratified his curio&s;ity in this too; upon which he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be taken on board, and after being comforted with a dram, told us, he belonged to the Ve&s;uvio man of war, upon a cruize off the i&s;land of Hi&s;|paniola; that he had fallen over-board about four and twenty hours ago, and the &s;hip being under &s;ail, they did not chu&s;e to bring to, but to&s;&s;ed a hen-coop over-board for his convenience, upon which he was in good hopes of reaching the Cape next morning; how&s;omever, he was as well content to be aboard of us, becau&s;e he did not doubt but that we &s;hould meet his &s;hip; and if he had gone a&s;hore on the bay, he might have been taken pri&s;oner by the French.&mdash;My uncle and father were very much divert|ed with the account of this fellow's unconcerned beha|viour; and in two days meeting with the Ve&s;uvio, as he expected, &s;ent him on board of her according to his de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Having beat up &s;ucce&s;sfully the windward pa&s;&s;age, we &s;tretched to the northward, and falling in with a we&s;terly wind, in eight weeks arrived in &s;oundings, and in two days after made the Lizard.&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the joy I felt at the &s;ight of Engli&s;h ground! Don Rodrigo was not unmoved, and Strap &s;hed tears of gladne&s;s.&mdash;The &s;ailors profited by our &s;atisfaction; the &s;hoe that was nailed to the ma&s;t, being quite filled with our liberality.&mdash;My uncle re&s;olved to run into the Downs at once; but the wind &s;hifting when we were a-brea&s;t of the i&s;le of Wight, he was obliged to turn into St. Helens, and come to an anchor at Spithead, to the great mortification of the crew, thirty of whom were immediately pre&s;&s;ed on board of a man of war.</P>
<P>My father and I went a&s;hore immediately at Port&s;mouth, leaving Strap with the captain to go round with the &s;hip, and take care of our effects; and I di&s;covered &s;o much im|patience to &s;ee my charming Narci&s;&s;a, that my father per|mitted me to ride acro&s;s the country to her brother's hou&s;e, while he &s;hould hire a po&s;t-chai&s;e for London, where he &s;hould wait for me at a place to which I directed him.</P>
<P>Fired with all the eagerne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, I took po&s;t that very night, and in the morning reached an inn, about
<PB N="238" REF="027715_0479_0FD5EF50997CB050">
three miles from the &s;quire's habitation. Here I remained till next evening, allaying the torture of my impatience with the rapturo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s hope of &s;eeing that divine creature, af|ter an ab&s;ence of eighteen months, which, &s;o far from im|pairing, had rai&s;ed my love to the mo&s;t exalted pitch! Neither were my reflections free from apprehen&s;ion, that &s;ometimes intervened in &s;pite of all my hope, and repre|&s;ented her as having yielded to the importunity of her brother, and ble&s;&s;ed the arms of an happy rival.&mdash;My thoughts were even maddened with the fear of her death; and when I arrived in the dark at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Sagely, I had not for &s;ome time the courage to de&s;ire ad|mittance, le&s;t my &s;oul &s;hould be &s;hocked with di&s;mal tid|ings. At length, however, I knocked, and no &s;ooner cer|tified the good gentlewoman of my voice, than &s;he opened the door, and received me with a mo&s;t affectionate embrace that brought tears into her aged eyes: <Q>For Heaven's &s;ake, dear mother,</Q> cried I, <Q>tell me, how is Nar|ci&s;&s;a? Is &s;he the &s;ame that I left her?</Q> She ble&s;&s;ed my ears with &s;aying, <Q>She is as beautiful, in as good health, and as much yours as ever.</Q>&mdash;Tran&s;ported at this a&s;|&s;urance, I begged to know if I could not &s;ee her that very night; when this &s;age matron gave me to under&s;tand that my mi&s;tre&s;s was in London, and that things were &s;trangely altered in the &s;quire's hou&s;e &s;ince my departure; that he had been married a whole year to Melinda, who at fir&s;t found means to wean his attention &s;o much from Narci&s;&s;a, that he became quite carele&s;s of that lovely &s;i&s;ter, com|forting him&s;elf with the clau&s;e of his father's will, by which &s;he would forfeit her fortune, if &s;he &s;hould marry without his con&s;ent;&mdash;that my mi&s;tre&s;s, being but indif|ferently treated by her &s;i&s;ter-in-law, had made u&s;e of her freedom &s;ome months ago, and gone to town, where &s;he was lodged with Mi&s;s Williams, in expectation of my ar|rival; and had been pe&s;tered with the addre&s;&s;es of Lord Quiverwit, who, finding her heart engaged, had fallen upon a great many &s;hifts, to per&s;uade her that I was dead; but finding all his artifices un&s;ucce&s;sful, and de|&s;pairing of gaining her affection, he had con&s;oled him&s;elf for her indifference, by marrying another lady &s;ome weeks ago, who had already le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t him on account of &s;ome family unea&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;Be&s;ides this intere&s;ting information, &s;he told

me, that there was not a great deal of harmony between Melinda and the &s;quire, who was &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted at the number of gallants who continued to hover about her, even after marriage, that he hurried her down into the country much again&s;t her inclination, where their mutual animo&s;ities had ri&s;en to &s;uch a height, that they pre&s;erved no decency before company or &s;ervants, but abu&s;ed one another in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t terms.</P>
<P>This good old gentlewoman, to give me a convincing proof of my dear Narci&s;&s;a's unalterable love, gratified me with a &s;ight of the la&s;t letter &s;he had favoured her with, in which I was mentioned with &s;o much honour, tender|ne&s;s, and concern, that my &s;oul was fired with impatience, and I determined to ride all night, that I might have it the &s;ooner in my power to make her happy.&mdash;Mrs. Sagely perceiving my eagerne&s;s, and her maternal affec|tion being equally divided between Narci&s;&s;a and me, begged leave to remind me of the &s;entiments with which I went abroad, that would not permit me, for any &s;elfi&s;h gratification, to prejudice the fortune of that amiable young lady, who mu&s;t entirely depend upon me, after ha|ving be&s;towed her&s;elf in marriage. I thanked her for her kind concern, and as briefly as po&s;&s;ible de&s;cribed my flou|ri&s;hing &s;ituation, which afforded this humane per&s;on infi|nite wonder and &s;atisfaction. I told her that now I had an opportunity to manife&s;t my gratitude for the obligation I owed, I would endeavour to make her old age comfort|able and ea&s;y; as a &s;tep to which I propo&s;ed &s;he &s;hould come and live with Narci&s;&s;a and me&mdash;This venerable gen|tlewoman was &s;o much affected with my words, that the tears ran down her ancient cheeks; &s;he thanked Heaven that I had not belied the pre&s;ages &s;he had made, on her fir&s;t acquaintance with me; acknowledging my genero&s;i|ty, as &s;he called it, in the mo&s;t elegant and pathetic ex|pre&s;&s;ions; but declined my propo&s;al, on account of her attachment to the dear melancholy cottage, were &s;he had &s;o peaceably con&s;umed her &s;olitary widowhood.

in the morning, where I alighted to procure fre&s;h hor&s;es; and, as I walked into the inn, perceived an apothecary's &s;hop on the other &s;ide of the &s;treet, with the name of Morgan over the door: alarmed at this di&s;covery I could not help thinking that my old me&s;s-mate had &s;ettled in this place; and upon inquiry, found my conjecture true, and that he was married lately to a widow of that city, by whom he had got three thou&s;and pounds. Rejoiced at this intelligence, I went to his &s;hop as &s;oon as it was open, and found my friend behind the counter, bu&s;y in preparing a cly&s;ter.&mdash;I &s;aluted him at entrance, with "Your &s;ervant, Mr. Morgan."&mdash;Upon which he looked at me, and replying, <Q>Your mo&s;t humble &s;ervant, goot Sir;</Q> rubbed his ingredients in the mortar, without any emotion.

In the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation he &s;hewed the &s;leeve buttons I had exchanged with him at our parting in the We&s;t In|dies, and was not a little proud to &s;ee that I had pre&s;er|ved his with the &s;ame care.

<P>Having renewed our prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip, I bid the hone&s;t Wel&s;hman and his &s;pou&s;e farewel, and, taking po&s;t-hor&s;es, arrived at London that &s;ame night, where I found my father in good health, to whom I imparted what I had learned of Narci&s;&s;a. This indulgent parent approved of my intention of marrying her even without a fortune, provided her brother's con&s;ent could not be ob|tained, promi&s;ed to make over to me, in a few days, a &s;ufficiency to maintain her in a fa&s;hionable manner, and expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of &s;eeing this amiable creature who had captivated me &s;o much. As I had not &s;lept the night be|fore, and was be&s;ides fatigued with my journey, I found my&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of taking &s;ome repo&s;e, and went to bed accordingly: next morning, about ten o'clock, I took a chair, and, according to Mr. Sagely's directions, went to my charmer's lodgings, and inquired for Mi&s;s Williams. I had not waited in a parlour longer than a minute, when this young woman entered, and no &s;ooner perceived me than &s;he &s;hrieked, and ran backward; I got between her and the door, and, cla&s;ping her in my arms, brought her to her&s;elf by an embrace. "Good Heaven," cried &s;he, <Q>Mr. Random, is it you, indeed? my mi&s;tre&s;s will run di&s;tracted with joy.</Q> I told her, it was from an apprehen&s;ion that my &s;udden appearance would have had &s;ome bad effect on my dear Narci&s;&s;a, that I had de&s;ired to &s;ee her fir&s;t, in order to concert &s;ome method of ac|quainting her mi&s;tre&s;s gradually with my arrival. She ap|proved of my conduct, and, after having yielded to the &s;ugge&s;tions of her own friend&s;hip in a&s;king if my voyage had been &s;ucce&s;sful, charged her&s;elf with that office, and left me glowing with de&s;ire of &s;eeing and embracing the object of my love.

<P>As my fir&s;t tran&s;port abated, my pa&s;&s;ion grew turbulent and unruly. I was giddy with &s;tanding on the brink of bli&s;s, and all my virtue and philo&s;ophy were &s;carce &s;uffi|cient to re&s;train the inordinate &s;allies of de&s;ire. Narci&s;&s;a

perceived the conflict within me, and with her u&s;ual dig|nity of prudence called off my imagination from the ob|ject in view, and, with eager expre&s;&s;ions of intere&s;ted cu|rio&s;ity, de&s;ired to know the particulars of my voyage. In this I gratified her inclination, bringing my &s;tory down to the pre&s;ent hour. She was infinitely &s;urpri&s;ed at the circum&s;tance of my finding my father, which brought tears into her lovely eyes. She was tran&s;ported at hearing that he approved my flame, di&s;covered a longing de&s;ire of being introduced to him, congratulated her&s;elf and me upon my good fortune, and ob&s;erved, that this great and unexpected &s;troke of fate &s;eemed to have been brought about by the immediate direction of Providence. Having entertained our&s;elves &s;ome hours with the genuine effu&s;ions of our &s;ouls, I obtained her con&s;ent to complete my hap|pine&s;s as &s;oon as my father &s;hould judge it proper; and applying with my own hands a valuable necklace, com|po&s;ed of diamonds and amethy&s;ts &s;et alternately, which an old Spani&s;h lady at Paraguay pre&s;ented me with, I took my leave, promi&s;ing to return in the afternoon with Don Rodrigo. When I went home, this generous parent inquired very affectionately about the health of my dear Narci&s;&s;a, to whom, that I might be the more agreeable, he put into my hands a deed, by which I found my&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of fifteen thou&s;and pounds, exclu&s;ive of the pro|fits of my own merchandi&s;e, which amounted to three thou&s;and more. After dinner I accompanied him to the lodging of my mi&s;tre&s;s, who, being dre&s;&s;ed for the occa|&s;ion, made a mo&s;t dazzling appearance. I could perceive him &s;truck with her figure, which I really think was the mo&s;t beautiful that ever was created under the fun. He embraced her tenderly, and told her, he was proud of having a &s;on who had &s;pirit to attempt, and qualifications to engage the affections of &s;uch a fine lady. She blu&s;hed at this compliment, and, with eyes full of the &s;ofte&s;t lan|gui&s;hment, turned upon me, and &s;aid, &s;he would have been unworthy of Mr. Random's attention, had &s;he been blind to his extraordinary merit. I made no other an&s;wer than a low bow. My father, &s;ighing, pronounced, <Q>Such once was my Charlotte!</Q> while the tear ru&s;hed into his eye, and the tender heart of Narci&s;&s;a manife&s;ted it&s;elf in two precious drops of &s;ympathy, which, but for his pre|&s;ence,

It was determined, that he &s;hould write to the &s;quire, &s;ignifying his appro|bation of my pa&s;&s;ion for his &s;i&s;ter, and offering a &s;ettle|ment which he &s;hould have no rea&s;on to reject, and that, if he &s;hould refu&s;e the propo&s;al, he &s;hould crown our mu|tual wi&s;hes without any farther regard.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFTER having &s;pent the evening to the &s;atisfaction of all pre&s;ent, my father addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus to Nar|ci&s;&s;a: <Q>Madam, give me leave to con&s;ider you hereafter as my daughter, in which capacity I in&s;i&s;t upon your accepting this fir&s;t in&s;tance of my paternal duty and affection.</Q> With the&s;e words, he put into her hand a bank-note for 500<HI>l.</HI> which &s;he no &s;ooner examined than, with a low curt&s;ey, &s;he replied, <Q>Dear Sir, though I have not the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for this &s;upply, I have too great a veneration for you to refu&s;e this proof of your genero&s;ity and e&s;teem, which I the more freely receive, becau&s;e I already look upon Mr. Random's intere&s;t as in&s;eparably connected with mine.</Q> He was extremely well plea&s;ed at her frank and ingenuous reply: upon which we &s;aluted, and wi&s;hed her good night. The letter, at my reque&s;t, was di&s;patched to Su&s;&s;ex by an expre&s;s, and in the mean time Don Rodrigo, to grace my nuptials, hired a ready-furni&s;hed hou&s;e, and &s;et up a very hand|&s;ome equipage.</P>
<P>Though I pa&s;&s;ed the greater part of the day with the darling of my &s;oul, I found lei&s;ure &s;ometimes to be among my former acquaintance, who were a&s;toni&s;hed at the mag|nificence

of my appearance: Banter in particular was confounded at the &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes of my fortune, the cau&s;es of which he endeavoured in vain to di&s;cover, until I thought fit to di&s;clo&s;e the whole &s;ecret of my la&s;t voyage, partly on con&s;ideration of our former intimacy, and partly to prevent unfavourable conjectures which he and others, in all probability, would have made in regard to my circum&s;tances. He profe&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfaction at this piece of news, and I had no cau&s;e to believe him in|&s;incere, when I con&s;idered, that he would now look upon him&s;elf as acquitted of the debt he owed me, and at the &s;ame time flatter him&s;elf with hopes of borrowing more.&mdash;I carried him home to dinner with me, and my father liked his conver&s;ation &s;o much, that upon hearing his dif|ficulties, he de&s;ired me to accommodate him for the pre|&s;ent, and inquire if he would accept of a commi&s;&s;ion in the army, towards the purcha&s;e of which he would wil|lingly lend him money. Accordingly, I gave my friend an opportunity of being alone with me, when, as I ex|pected, he told me, that he was ju&s;t upon the point of be|ing reconciled to an old rich uncle, who&s;e heir he was, but wanted a few pieces for immediate expence, which he de&s;ired I would lend him, and take his bond for the whole. His demand was limited to ten guineas; and when I put twenty into his hands, he &s;tared at me for &s;ome moments, then putting it into his pur&s;e, &s;aid, <Q>Ay, 'tis all one, you'll have the whole in a very &s;hort time.</Q> When I had taken his note, to &s;ave the expence of a bond, I ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, that a fellow of his &s;pirit &s;hould loi|ter away his time in idlene&s;s, and a&s;ked why he did not chu&s;e to make his fortune in the army.&mdash;"What!" &s;aid he, <Q>throw away money upon a &s;ubaltern's commi&s;&s;ion, to be under the command of a parcel of &s;coundrels, who have rai&s;ed them&s;elves above me by the mo&s;t infa|mous practices! no, I love independency too well to &s;acrifice my life, health and plea&s;ure to &s;uch a pitiful con&s;ideration.</Q>&mdash;Finding him aver&s;e to this way of life, I changed the &s;ubject, and returned to Don Rodrigo, who had ju&s;t received the following epi&s;tle from the &s;quire.</P>

<P>My father was not much &s;urpri&s;ed at this polite letter, after having heard the character of the author: and as for me, I was even plea&s;ed at his refu&s;al, becau&s;e I now had an opportunity of &s;hewing my di&s;intere&s;ted love. By his permi&s;&s;ion I waited upon my charmer, and having imparted to her the contents of her brother's letter, at which &s;he wept bitterly, in &s;pite of all my con&s;olation and care&s;&s;es, the time of our marriage was fixed at the di&s;tance of two days.&mdash;During this interval in which my &s;oul was wound up to the la&s;t &s;tretch of rapturous expectation, Narci&s;&s;a en|deavoured to reconcile &s;ome of her relations in town to her marriage with me; but finding them all deaf to her re|mon&s;trances, either out of envy or prejudice, &s;he told me with the mo&s;t enchanting &s;weetne&s;s, while the tears be|dewed her lovely cheeks, <Q>Sure the world will no longer que&s;tion your genero&s;ity, when you take a poor forlorn beggar to your arms.</Q> Affected with her &s;orrow, I pre&s;&s;ed the fair mourner to my brea&s;t, and &s;wore that &s;he was more dear and welcome on that account, becau&s;e &s;he had &s;acrificed her friends and fortune to her love for me.&mdash;My uncle, for who&s;e character &s;he had a great venera|tion, being by this time come to town, I introduced him to my bride: and although he was not very much &s;ubject to refined &s;en&s;ations, he was &s;truck dumb with admiration at her beauty. After having ki&s;&s;ed and gazed at her for &s;ome time, he turned to me, &s;aying, <Q>Odds bobs, Ro|ry! here's a notable prize indeed, finely built and glo|riou&s;ly

The hone&s;t captain was tran&s;ported at her courteous behaviour, and in&s;i&s;ted upon <HI>giving her away</HI> at the ceremony, &s;wear|ing that he loved her as well as if &s;he was his own child, and that he would give two thou&s;and guineas to the fir&s;t fruit of our love, as &s;oon as it could &s;queak.&mdash;Every thing being prepared for the &s;olemnization of our nuptials, which were to be performed privately at my father's hou&s;e, the au&s;picious hour arrived, when Don Rodrigo and my uncle went in the coach to fetch the bride and Mi&s;s Wil|liams; leaving me with a par&s;on, Banter, and Strap, nei|ther of whom had as yet &s;een my charming mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;My faithful valet, who was on the rack of impatience to be|hold a lady of whom he had heard &s;o much, no &s;ooner under&s;tood that the coach was returned, than he placed him&s;elf at a window to have a peep at her as &s;he alighted; and when he &s;aw her, he clapped his hands together, turn|ed up the white of his eyes, and with his mouth wide open, remained in a &s;ort of exta&s;y, which broke out into, <HI><Q>O Dea certe!&mdash;qualis in Eurotoe ripis, aut per juga Cyn|thi exercet Diana chorus!</Q></HI>&mdash;The doctor and Banter were &s;urpri&s;ed to hear my man &s;peak Latin; but when my father led Narci&s;&s;a into the room, the object of their ad|miration was &s;oon changed, as appeared in the counte|nance of both.&mdash;Indeed they mu&s;t have been the mo&s;t in|&s;en&s;ible of all beings, could they have beheld, without emotion, the divine creature that approached! She was dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ack of white &s;attin, embroidered on the brea&s;t with gold; the crown of her head was covered with a &s;mall French cap, from whence de&s;cended her beautiful hair in ringlets, that waved upon her &s;nowy neck, which

When &s;he left the room, her face was over&s;pread with a blu&s;h that &s;et all my blood in a &s;tate of fermentation, and made every pul&s;e beat with tenfold vigour! She was &s;o cruel as to let me remain in this condition a full half hour; when, no longer able to re&s;train my impatience, I broke from the company, bur&s;t into her chamber, pu&s;hed out her confidante, locked the door, and found her&mdash;O heaven and earth! a fea&s;t, a thou&s;and times more delicious than my mo&s;t &s;anguine hope pre&s;aged!&mdash;But let me not profane the cha&s;te my&s;teries of Hymen&mdash;I was the happie&s;t of men.</P>

I was di&s;tracted with joy! I could not believe the evidence of my &s;en&s;es, and looked upon all that had happened as the
<PB N="249" REF="027715_0490_0FD5EF761ED301A8">
fictions of a dream! In the mean time my uncle knocked at the door, and bid me turn out; for I had had a long &s;pell. I got up accordingly, and &s;ent Mi&s;s Williams to her mi&s;tre&s;s, my&s;elf receiving the congratulations of Cap|tain Bowling, who rallied me in his &s;ea phra&s;e with great &s;ucce&s;s. In le&s;s than an hour Don Rodrigo led my wife in to breakfa&s;t, where &s;he received the compliments of the company on her looks, which they &s;aid, if po&s;&s;ible, were improved by matrimony. As her delicate ears were of|fended with none of tho&s;e indecent ambiguities, which are too often &s;poke on &s;uch occa&s;ions, &s;he behaved with dig|nity, unaffected mode&s;ty, and ea&s;e; and, as a te&s;timony of my affection and e&s;teem, I pre&s;ented her, in pre&s;ence of them all, with a deed, by which I &s;ettled the whole fortune I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of on her and her heirs for ever. She accepted it with a glance of the mo&s;t tender acknowledg|ment, ob&s;erved, that &s;he could not be &s;urpri&s;ed at any thing of this kind I &s;hould do, and de&s;ired my father to take the trouble of keeping it, &s;aying, <Q>Next to my own, Mr. Random, you are the per&s;on in whom I ought to have the greate&s;t confidence.</Q> Charmed with her prudent and ingenuous manner of proceeding, he took the paper, and a&s;&s;ured her, that it &s;hould not lo&s;e its value while in his cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>As we had not many vi&s;its to give and receive, the lit|tle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we &s;taid in town was &s;pent in going to public di|ver&s;ions, where, I have the vanity to think, Narci&s;&s;a &s;el|dom was eclip&s;ed. One night, in particular, we had &s;ent our footman to keep one of the &s;tage-boxes, which we no &s;ooner entered, than we perceived in the oppo&s;ite box the &s;quire and his lady, who &s;eemed not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing us. I was plea&s;ed at this opportunity of confront|ing them, the more, becau&s;e Melinda was robbed of all her admirers by my wife, who happened that night to out&s;hine her &s;i&s;ter both in beauty and in dre&s;s. She was piqued at Narci&s;&s;a's victory, to&s;&s;ed her head a thou&s;and different ways, flirted her fan, looked at us with di&s;dain, then whi&s;pered to her hu&s;band, and broke out into an af|fected giggle; but all her arts proved ineffectual either to di&s;compo&s;e Mrs. Random, or to conceal her own mor|tification, which at length forced her away long before the play was done. The news of our marriage being

&s;pread, with many circum&s;tances to our di&s;advantage, by the indu&s;try of this malignant creature, a certain &s;et of per&s;ons, fond of &s;candal, began to inquire into the par|ticulars of my fortune, which they no &s;ooner under&s;tood to be independent, than the tables were turned, and our ac|quaintance was courted as much as it had been de&s;pi&s;ed be|fore: but Narci&s;&s;a had too much dignity of pride to encou|rage this change of conduct, e&s;pecially in her relations, whom &s;he could never be prevailed upon to &s;ee after the malicious reports they had rai&s;ed to her prejudice.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>My father intends to vi&s;it the place of his nativity&mdash;we pro|po&s;e to accompany him&mdash;my uncle renews his will in my favour, determining to go to &s;ea again&mdash;we &s;et out for Scotland&mdash;arrive at Edinburgh&mdash;purcha&s;e our paternal e&s;tate&mdash;proceed to it&mdash;halt at the town where I was edu|cated&mdash;take up my bond to Crab&mdash;the behaviour of Potion and his wife, and one of my female cou&s;ins&mdash;our reception at the e&s;tate&mdash;Strap marries Mi&s;s Williams, and is &s;et|tled by my father to his own &s;atisfaction&mdash;I am more and more happy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MY father intending to revi&s;it his native country, and pay the tribute of a few tears at my mother's grave, Narci&s;&s;a and I re&s;olved to accompany him in the execution of this pious office, and accordingly prepared for the journey; in which, however, my uncle would not engage, being re&s;olved to try his fortune once more at &s;ea. In the mean time he renewed his will in favour of my wife and me, and depo&s;ited it in the hands of his brother-in-law; while I (that I might not be wanting to my own intere&s;t) &s;ummoned the &s;quire to produce his father's will at Doctor's Commons, and employed a proctor to manage the affair in my ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Every thing being thus &s;ettled, we took leave of all our friends in London, and &s;et out for Scotland, Don Rodrigo, Narci&s;&s;a, Mi&s;s Williams, and I in the coach, and Strap, with two men in livery, on hor&s;eback: as we made ea&s;y &s;tages, my charmer held it out very well till we arrived at Edinburgh, where we propo&s;ed to re&s;t our&s;elves
<PB N="251" REF="027715_0492_0FD5EF79156B69E8">
&s;ome weeks. People of our figure could not fail of attract|ing the notice of &s;uch a &s;mall place, where, as &s;oon as our family was known, we were loaded with care&s;&s;es, and Narci&s;&s;a was &s;o much plea&s;ed with the civilities &s;he receiv|ed, that &s;he prote&s;ted &s;he would never de&s;ire to live in any other part of the world.</P>
<P>Here Don Rodrigo having intelligence that his ne|phew the fox-hunter had &s;pent his e&s;tate, which was to be expo&s;ed to &s;ale by public auction, he determined to make a purcha&s;e of the &s;pot where he was born, and actually bought the whole of his father's lands.</P>
<P>In a few days after the bargain was made, we left Edinburgh, in order to go and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and, by the way, halted one night in the town where I was edu|cated.&mdash;Upon inquiry, I found that Mr. Crab was dead; whereupon I &s;ent for his executor, paid the &s;um I owed, with intere&s;t, and took up my bond. Mr. Potion and his wife, hearing of our arrival, had the a&s;&s;urance to come to the inn where we lodged, and &s;ent up their names, with a de&s;ire of being permitted to pay their re&s;pects to my fa|ther and me: but their &s;ordid behaviour towards me, when I was an orphan, had made too deep an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind to be effaced by this mean mercenary piece of conde&s;cen&s;ion: I therefore rejected their me&s;&s;age with di&s;dain, and bid Strap tell them, that my father and I de&s;ired to have no communication with &s;uch low-minded wretches as they were.</P>
<P>They had not been gone half an hour, when a woman, without any ceremony, opened the door of the room where we &s;at, and making towards my father, acco&s;ted him with, "Uncle, your &s;ervant&mdash;I am glad to &s;ee you."&mdash;This was no other than one of my female cou&s;ins mentioned in the fir&s;t part of my memoirs, to whom Don Rodrigo replied, "Pray, who are you, Madam?"&mdash;"Oh!" cried &s;he, <Q>my cou&s;in Rory, there, knows me very well&mdash;Don't you remember me, Rory?</Q>&mdash;"Yes, Madam," &s;aid I, <Q>for my own part, I &s;hall never forget you.&mdash;Sir, this is one of the young ladies, who (as I have formerly told you) treated me &s;o humanely in my childhood!</Q> When I pronounced the&s;e words, my father's re&s;entment glowed in his vi&s;age, and he ordered her to begone, with &s;uch a commanding a&s;pect, that &s;he retired in a fright,
<PB N="252" REF="027715_0493_0FD5EF7E34C235D8">
muttering cur&s;es as &s;he went down &s;tair: we afterwards learned that &s;he was married to an en&s;ign, who had alrea|dy &s;pent all her fortune; and that her &s;i&s;ter had bore a child to her mother's footman, who is now her hu&s;band, and keeps a petty ale-hou&s;e in the country.</P>
<P>The fame of our flouri&s;hing condition having arrived at this place before us, we got notice that the magi&s;trates intended next day to compliment us with the freedom of their town; upon which my father, con&s;idering their complai&s;ance in the right point of view, ordered the hor|&s;es to the coach early in the morning, when we proceed|ed to our e&s;tate, which lay about a dozen miles from this place.</P>
<P>When we came within half a league of the hou&s;e, we were met by a prodigious number of poor tenants, men, women, and children, who te&s;tified their joy by loud ac|clamations, and accompanied our coach to the gate. As there is no part of the world in which the pea&s;ants are more attached to their lords than in Scotland, we were almo&s;t devoured by their affection, in getting out of the coach: my father had always been their favourite, and now that he appeared their ma&s;ter, after being thought dead &s;o long, their joy broke out into a thou&s;and extra|vagances: when we got into the court-yard, we were &s;ur|rounded by a va&s;t number, who crowded together &s;o clo&s;e|ly to &s;ee us, that &s;everal were in danger of being &s;queez|ed to death; tho&s;e who were near Don Rodrigo fell upon their knees, and ki&s;&s;ed his hand, or the hem of his garment, praying aloud for long life and pro&s;perity to him; others approached Narci&s;&s;a and me in the &s;ame manner; while the re&s;t clapped their hands at a di&s;tance, and invoked Heaven to &s;hower its choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings on our heads!&mdash;In &s;hort, the whole &s;cene, though rude, was &s;o affecting, that the gentle partner of my heart wept over it, and my father him&s;elf could not refrain from dropping a tear.</P>
<P>Having welcomed his daughter and me to his hou&s;e, he ordered &s;ome bullocks to be killed, and &s;ome hog&s;heads of ale to be brought from the neighbouring village, to regale tho&s;e hone&s;t people, who had not enjoyed &s;uch a holiday for many years before.</P>
<P>Next day we were vi&s;ited by the gentlemen in the
<PB N="254" REF="027715_0494_0FD5EF801C633A28">
neighbourhood, mo&s;t of them our relations, one of whom brought along with him my cou&s;in the fox-hunter, who had &s;taid at his hou&s;e &s;ince he was obliged to leave his own. My father was generous enough to receive him kindly, and even promi&s;ed to purcha&s;e for him a commi&s;|&s;ion in the army, at which he expre&s;&s;ed great thankfulne&s;s and joy.</P>
<P>My charming Narci&s;&s;a was univer&s;ally admired and loved for her beauty, affability and good &s;en&s;e&punc; and &s;o well plea&s;ed with the &s;ituation of the place, and the com|pany around, that &s;he has not yet di&s;covered the lea&s;t de|&s;ire of changing her habitation.</P>
<P>We had not been many days &s;ettled, when I prevailed upon my father to pay a vi&s;it to the village where I had been at &s;chool. Here we were received by the principal inhabitants, who entertained us in the church, where Mr. Syntax the &s;choolma&s;ter (my tyrant being dead) pro|nounced a Latin &s;peech in honour of our family: and none exerted them&s;elves more than Strap's father and re|lations, who looked upon the hone&s;t valet as the fir&s;t gen|tleman of their race, and honoured his benefactors ac|cordingly.&mdash;Having received the homage of this place, we retired, leaving forty pounds for the benefit of the poor of the pari&s;h; and that very night Strap being a little elevated with the regard that had been &s;hewn to him, and to me on his account, ventured to tell me that he had a &s;neaking kindne&s;s for Mi&s;s Williams, and that if his lady and I would u&s;e our intere&s;t in his behalf, he did not doubt that &s;he would li&s;ten to his addre&s;&s;es. Surpri&s;ed at this propo&s;al, I a&s;ked if he knew the &s;tory of that unfor|tunate young gentlewoman: upon which he replied, <Q>Yes, yes, I know what you mean&mdash;&s;he has been unhappy, I grant you&mdash;but what of that? I am convinced of her reformation; or el&s;e you and my good lady would not treat her with &s;uch re&s;pect.&mdash;As for the cen&s;ure of the world, I value it not a fig's end: be&s;ides, the world knows nothing of the matter.</Q> I commended his phi|lo&s;ophy, and intere&s;ted Narci&s;&s;a in his cau&s;e; who inter|ceded &s;o effectually, that in a little time Mi&s;s Williams yielded her con&s;ent, and they were married, with the ap|probation of Don Rodrigo, who gave him five hundred pounds to &s;tock a farm, and made him over&s;eer of his
<PB N="255" REF="027715_0495_0FD5EF816145AB70">
e&s;tate. My generous bed-fellow gave her maid the &s;ame &s;um; &s;o that they live in great peace and plenty, within half a mile of us, and daily put up prayers for our pre|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>If there be &s;uch a thing as true happine&s;s on earth, I enjoy it.&mdash;The impetuous tran&s;ports of my pa&s;&s;ion are now &s;ettled, and mellowed into endearing fondne&s;s and tranquillity of love, rooted by that intimate connection and interchange of hearts, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ought but virtuous wedlock can produce. Fortune &s;eems determined to make ample amends for her former cruelty; for my proctor writes, that notwith&s;tanding the clau&s;e in my father-in-law's will, on which the &s;quire founds his claim, I &s;hall certainly recover my wife's fortune, in con&s;equence of a codicil annexed, which explains that clau&s;e, and limits her re&s;triction to the age of nineteen, after which &s;he was at her own di&s;po&s;al.&mdash;I would have &s;et out for London immediately after receiving this piece of intelligence; but my dear angel has been qualmi&s;h of late, and begins to grow remarkably round in the wai&s;t; &s;o that I cannot leave her in &s;uch an intere&s;ting &s;ituation, which I hope will produce &s;omething to crown my felicity.</P>
