<Q><HI>Be kindly affectioned one to another, with brotherly love, in honour preferring one another.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this chapter, from whence my text is taken, we find the Apo&s;tle Paul labouring with the Romans to pre&s;s on them the great duties of Brotherly Love.</P>
<P>By an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and conformity to the will of God, whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promi&s;es, that by the&s;e we might be made partakers of the divine nature, having e&s;caped the corruption that is in the world through lu&s;t&mdash;That being all members of the body of Chri&s;t with the Church, we ought to apply the gifts we have received to the advantage of our brethren, tho&s;e of us e&s;pecially who are called to any office in the church, by di&s;charging it with zeal and integrity and benevolence, which is the mo&s;t important duty, and comprehends all the re&s;t, and particularly the following&mdash;which the apo&s;tle here &s;ets down&mdash;which are to love one another &s;incerely, to be ready to all good offices&mdash;to &s;ym|pathize
<PB N="4" REF="021931_0003_0FB607335F9F98A8">
in the good or evil that befals our bre|thren, to comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e that are in afflic|tion, and to live together in a &s;pirit of humility, peace and unity. Benevolence does yet further oblige chri&s;tians to love and ble&s;s tho&s;e who hate them and injure them, to endeavour to have peace with all men, to ab&s;tain from revenge, and to ren|der them good for evil; the&s;e are the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential duties of the religion we profe&s;s; and we de&s;erve the name of chri&s;tians no further than we &s;incere|ly practi&s;e them to the glory of God and the good of our own &s;ouls and bodies, and the good of all mankind.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t, my Brethren, let us learn to pray to God through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t for under|&s;tanding, that we may know our&s;elves; for without this we can never be fit for the &s;ociety of man, we mu&s;t learn to guide our&s;elves before we can guide others, and when we have done this we &s;hall under&s;tand the apo&s;tle, Romans xii. 16. "Be not wi&s;e in your own conceits," for when we get wi&s;e in our&s;elves we are then too wi&s;e for God, and con&s;equently not fit for the &s;ociety of man&mdash;I mean the chri&s;tian part of mankind&mdash;Let all my brethren Ma&s;ons con&s;ider what they are called to&mdash;May God grant you an humble heart to fear God and love his commandments; then and only then you will in &s;incerity love your brethren: And you will be enabled, as in the words of my text, to be kindly affectioned one to another, with brotherly love in honour prefer|ring one another. Therefore, with the apo&s;tle
<PB N="5" REF="021931_0004_0FB6073F37CA45B8">
Paul, I be&s;eech you therefore brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye pre&s;ent your bodies a living &s;acrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your rea&s;onable &s;ervice&mdash;let love be without di&s;&s;imulation, abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good. The&s;e and many other duties are required of us as chri&s;tians, every one of which are like &s;o many links of a chain, which when joined together make one complete member of Chri&s;t; this we profe&s;s to believe a Chri&s;tians and as Ma&s;ons.&mdash;I &s;hall &s;top here with the intro|duction, which brings me to the points I &s;hall endeavour to prove.&mdash;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the anciency of Ma&s;onry, that being done, will endeavour to prove all other titles we have a ju&s;t right as Ma&s;ons to claim&mdash;namely, honour|able, free and accepted: To do this I mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the creation of this our world.&mdash;After the Grand Architect of the Univer&s;e had framed the heavens for beauty and delight for the beings he was then about to make, he then called the earth to appear out of darkne&s;s, &s;aying, let there be light, and it was &s;o; he al&s;o &s;et the &s;un, moon and &s;tars in the firmament of heaven, for the delight of his creatures&mdash;he then created the fi&s;hes of the &s;ea, the fowls of the air, then the bea&s;ts of the earth after their various kinds, and God ble&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>Thus all things were in their order prepared for the mo&s;t excellent accompli&s;hed piece of the vi&s;ible creation, Man.&mdash;The forming this mo&s;t excellent creature Man, was the clo&s;e of the
<PB N="6" REF="021931_0005_0FB6074158A15BE0">
creation, &s;o it was peculiar to him to have a &s;olemn con&s;ultation and decree about his making, and God &s;aid, let us make Man.&mdash;Seneca &s;ays, that man is not a work huddled over in ha&s;te, and done without fore-thinking and great con|&s;ideration, for man is the greate&s;t and mo&s;t &s;tupendous work of God.&mdash;Man hath not only a body in common with all inferior animals, but into his body was infu&s;ed a &s;oul of a far more noble nature and make&mdash;a rational prin|ciple to act according to the de&s;igns of his creation; that is, to contemplate the works of God, to admire his perfections, to wor&s;hip him, to live as becomes one who received his excellent being from him, to conver&s;e with his fellow creatures that are of his own order, to maintain mutual love and &s;ociety, and to &s;erve God in con|&s;ort. Man is a wonderful creature, and not unde|vedly &s;aid to be a little world, a world within him&s;elf, and containing whatever is found in the Creator.&mdash;In him is the &s;piritual and immaterial nature of God, the rea&s;onablene&s;s of Angels, tho &s;en&s;ative power of brutes, the vegetative life of plants, and the virtue of all the elements he holds conver&s;e with in both worlds.&mdash;Thus man is crowned with glory and honour, he is the mo&s;t remarkable workman&s;hip of God. And is man &s;uch a noble creature and made to con|ver&s;e with his fellow men that are of his own order, to maintain mutual love and &s;ociety, and to &s;erve God in con&s;ort with each other?&mdash;then what can the&s;e God-provoking wretches think,
<PB N="7" REF="021931_0006_0FB607424653E750">
who de&s;pi&s;e their fellow men, as tho' they were not of the &s;ame &s;pecies with them&s;elves, and would if in their power deprive them of the ble&s;&s;ings and comforts of this life, which God in his bountiful goodne&s;s, hath freely given to all his creatures to improve and enjoy? Surely &s;uch mon&s;ters never came out of the hand of God in &s;uch a forlorn condition.&mdash;Which brings me to con&s;ider the fall of man; and the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden, to dre&s;s it and to keep it, and freely to eat of every tree of the garden; here was his delightful employ and bountiful wages, and but one tree out of all that va&s;t number he was forbidden to eat of. Concerning this garden, there have been different opinions about it by the learned, where it was, but the mo&s;t of them agree that it was about the center of the earth, and that the four rivers parted or divided the four quarters of the world. The fir&s;t was Pi&s;on, that was it which compa&s;&s;eth the land of Ha|vilah; this river Pi&s;on is called by &s;ome Pha&s;is, or Pha&s;i Tigris, it runs (they &s;ay) by that Havilah whither the Amalekites fled, &s;ee 1 Sam. xv. 7. and divides it from the country of Su&s;i|anna, and at la&s;t falls into the Per&s;ian Gulf, &s;aith Galtruchius and others; but from the opinions of chri&s;tian writers, who hold, that Havilah is India, and Pi&s;on the river Ganges. This was fir&s;t a&s;&s;erted by Jo&s;ephus, and from him Eu&s;tu|bius, Jerom, and mo&s;t of the fathers received it, and not without good rea&s;on; for Mo&s;es here

adds, as a mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to know the place by, that there is gold, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d the gold of that land is good; now it is confe&s;&s;ed by all, that India is the mo&s;t noted for gold, and of the be&s;t &s;ort. It is added again, a note whereby to di&s;cover that place, that there is bdellium and the onyx &s;tone&mdash;and India is famous for precious &s;tones and pearls.&mdash;The name of the &s;econd river is Gihon, the &s;ame is it which compa&s;&s;eth the whole land of Ethiopia (or Cu&s;h as it is in the original) there is rea&s;on to believe that this Gihon is the river of Nile, as the forenamed Jo&s;ephus and mo&s;t of the ancient writers of the church hold, and by the help of the river Nile, Paradi&s;e did as it were border upon Egypt, which is the principal part of the African Ethiopia, which the ancient writers hold is meant there: The name of the third river is Hiddekel, that is it which goeth toward the ea&s;t of A&s;&s;yria, ver. 14. That it was a river belong|ing to Babylon is clear from Dan. x. 4; this is concluded to be the river Tygris, which di|vides Me&s;opotamia from A&s;&s;yria, and goeth along with Euphrates, this being the great middle chan|nel that ran through Edom or Babylon, and may be thought to take its name from its fructifying quality. The&s;e are the four grand land marks which the all-wi&s;e and gracious God was plea&s;ed to draw as the bounds and habitation of all nations which he was about to &s;ettle in this world; if &s;o, what nation or people dare, without highly di&s;plea&s;ing and provoking that God to pour down his judgments upon them.&mdash;I &s;ay,
<PB N="9" REF="021931_0008_0FB6074C925D7A20">
dare to de&s;pi&s;e or tyrannize over their lives or liber|ties, or incroach on their lands, or to in&s;lave their bodies? God hath and ever will vi&s;it &s;uch a nation or people as this.&mdash;Envy and pride are the leading lines to all the mi&s;eries that mankind have &s;uf|fered from the beginning of the world to this pre&s;ent day. What was it but the&s;e that turned the devil out of heaven into a hell of mi&s;ery, but envy and pride?&mdash;Was it not the &s;ame &s;pirit that moved him to tempt our fir&s;t parents to &s;in again&s;t &s;o holy and ju&s;t a God, who had but ju&s;t (if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion) turned his back from crowning Adam with honour and glory?&mdash;But envy at his pro&s;perity hath taken the crown of glory from his head, and hath made us his po&s;terity mi&s;erable.&mdash;What was it but this that made Cain murder his brother, whence is it but from the&s;e that our modern Cains call us Africans the &s;ons of Cain? (We admit it if you plea&s;e) and we will find from him and his &s;ons Ma&s;onry began, after the fall of his father. Altho' Adam, when placed in the garden, God would not &s;uffer him to be idle and unemployed in that hap|py &s;tate of innocence, but &s;et him to dre&s;s and to keep that choice piece of earth; here he was to employ his mind as well as exerci&s;e his body; here he was to contemplate and &s;tudy God's works; here he was to enjoy God, him&s;elf and the whole world, to &s;ubmit him&s;elf wholly to his divine conduct, to conform all his actions to the will of his Maker; but by his &s;udden fall he
<PB N="10" REF="021931_0009_0FB6074D814DFFE8">
lo&s;t that good will that he owed to his God, and for &s;ome time lo&s;t the &s;tudy of God's works; but no doubt he afterwards taught his &s;ons the art of Ma&s;onry; for how el&s;e could Cain after &s;o much trouble and perplexity have time to &s;tudy the art of building a city, as he did on the ea&s;t of Eden, Gen. iv. 17. and without doubt he teached his &s;ons the art, ver. 20, 21.&mdash;</P>
<P>But to return, bad as Cain was, yet God took not from him his faculty of &s;tudying architec|ture, arts and &s;ciences&mdash;his &s;ons al&s;o were endued with the &s;ame &s;pirit, and in &s;ome convenient place no doubt they met and communed with each other for in&s;truction. It &s;eems that the all wi&s;e God put this into the hearts of Cain's family thus to employ them&s;elves, to divert their minds from mu&s;ing on their father's murder and the woful cur&s;e God had pronounced on him, as we don't find any more of Cain's complaints after this.</P>
<P>Similar to this we have in the 6 Gen. 12 &amp; 13, that God &s;aw that all men had corrupted their way, and that their hearts were only evil continu|ally; and 14, 15, 16 ver&s;es, the great Architect of the univer&s;e gives Noah a compleat plan of the ark and &s;ets him to work, and his &s;ons as a&s;&s;i&s;tants, like deputy and two grand wardens. One thing is well known, our enemies them&s;elves being judges, that in what&s;oever nation or kingdom in the whole world where Ma&s;onry abounds mo&s;t, there hath been and &s;till are the mo&s;t peaceable &s;ubjects, cheerfully conforming to the laws of that country
<PB N="11" REF="021931_0010_0FB6074EFA919F30">
in which they re&s;ide, always willing to &s;ubmit to their magi&s;trates and rulers, and where Ma&s;onry mo&s;t abounds, arts and &s;ciences, whether mechani|cal or liberal, all of them have a mighty tenden|cy to the delight and benefit of mankind; there|fore we need not que&s;tion but the allwi&s;e God by putting this into our hearts intended, as another end of our creation, that we &s;hould not only live happily our&s;elves, but be likewi&s;e mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing to each other. Again, it is not only good and beneficial in a time of peace, in a nation or king|dom, but in a time of war, for that brotherly love that cements us together by the bonds of friend|&s;hip, no wars or tumults can &s;eparate; for in the heat of war if a brother &s;ees another in di&s;tre&s;s he will relieve him &s;ome way or other, and kindly receive him as a brother, prefering him before all others, according to the Apo&s;tle's exhortation in my text, as al&s;o a &s;imilar in&s;tance you have 1 Kings, x. from 31&s;t to 38th ver&s;e, where you find Benhadad in great di&s;tre&s;s, having lo&s;t a nu|merous army in two battles, after his great boa&s;t|ing, and he him&s;elf forced to hide him&s;elf in a chamber, and &s;ends a me&s;&s;age to Ahab king of I&s;rael to reque&s;t only his life as a captive; but be|hold the brotherly love of a Ma&s;on! no &s;ooner was the me&s;&s;age delivered, but he cries out in a rapture&mdash;is he alive&mdash;he is my brother! Every Ma&s;on knows that they were both of the craft, and al&s;o the me&s;&s;engers. Thus far may &s;uffice for the anciency of this grand art; as for the honour of it&mdash;it is a &s;ociety which God him&s;elf has been
<PB N="12" REF="021931_0011_0FB607572F869870">
plea&s;ed to honour ever &s;ince he breathed into Adam the breath of life, and hath from generation to generation in&s;pired men with wi&s;dom, and planned out and given directions how they &s;hould build, and with what materials. And fir&s;t, Noah in build|ing the ark wherein he was &s;aved, while God in his ju&s;tice was plea&s;ed to de&s;troy the unbelieving world of mankind. The fir&s;t thing Noah did upon his landing was to build an altar to offer &s;acrifice to that great&punc; God which had delivered him out of &s;o great a deluge; God accepted the &s;acrifice and ble&s;&s;ed him, and as they journeyed from the ea&s;t towards the we&s;t, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and dwelt there, and his &s;ons.</P>
<P>Nimrod the &s;on of Cu&s;h, the &s;on of Ham, fir&s;t founded the Babylonian monarchy, and kept po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the plains, and founded the fir&s;t great empire at Babylon, and became grand ma&s;ter of all Ma&s;ons, he built many &s;plendid cities in Shinar, and under him flouri&s;hed tho&s;e learned Mathema|ticians, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ors were &s;tyled in the book of Daniel, Magi, or wi&s;e men, for their &s;uperior knowledge. The migration from Shinar commen|ced fifty three years after they began to build the tower, and one hundred and fifty four years after the flood, and they went off at various times and travelled ea&s;t, we&s;t, north and &s;outh, with their mighty &s;kill, and found the u&s;e of it in &s;ettling their colonies; and from Shinar the arts were car|ried to di&s;tant parts of the earth, notwith&s;tanding the confu&s;ion of languages, which gave ri&s;e to Ma&s;ons faculty and univer&s;al practice of conver&s;ing
<PB N="13" REF="021931_0012_0FB60758489330C0">
without &s;peaking, and of knowing each other by &s;igns and tokens; they &s;ettled the di&s;per&s;ion in ca&s;e any of them &s;hould meet in di&s;tant parts of the world who had been before in Shinar. Thus the earth was again planted and repleni&s;hed with Ma&s;ons the &s;econd &s;on of Ham carried into Egypt; there he built the city of Heliopolis&mdash;Thebes with an hundred gates&mdash;they built al&s;o the &s;tatue of Sphynx, who&s;e head was 120 feet round, being reckoned the fir&s;t or earlie&s;t of the &s;even wonders of arts. Shem the &s;econd &s;on of Noah remained at Ur of the Chaldees in Shinar, with his father and his great grand&s;on Heber, where they lived in private and died in peace: But Shem's offspring travelled into the &s;outh and ea&s;t of A&s;ia, and their offspring propagated the &s;cience and the art as far as China and Japan.</P>
<P>While Noah, Shem and Heber diverted them|&s;elves at Ur in mathematical &s;tudies, teaching Peleg the father of Rehu, of Sereg, Nachor, and Terah, father of Abram, a learned race of mathematicians and geometricians; thus Abram, born two years after the death of Noah, had learned well the &s;cience and the art before the God of glory called him to travel from Ur of the Chaldees, but a fa|mine &s;oon forced him down to Egypt; the de&s;cen|dants of Abram &s;ojourned in Egypt, as &s;hepherds &s;till lived in tents, practi&s;ed very little of the art of architecture till about eighty years before their Exodus, when by the overruling hand of provi|dence they were trained up to the building with &s;tone and brick, in order to make them expert

Ma&s;ons before they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the promi&s;ed land; after Abram left Charran 430 years, Mo&s;es march|ed out of Egypt at the head of 600,000 Hebrews, males, for who&s;e &s;akes God divided the red &s;ea to let them pa&s;s through Arabia to Canaan. God was plea&s;ed to in&s;pire their grand ma&s;ter Mo&s;es, and Jo&s;hua his deputy, with wi&s;dom of heart; &s;o the next year they rai&s;ed the curious tabernacle or tent; God having called Mo&s;es up into the mount and gave him an exact pattern of it, and charges him to make it exactly to that pattern, and withal gave him the two tables of &s;tone; the&s;e he broke at the foot of the mount; God gave him orders to hew two more him&s;elf, after the likene&s;s of the former. God did not only in&s;pire Mo&s;es with wi&s;dom to undertake the over&s;ight of the great work, but he al&s;o in&s;pired Bezaleel with know|ledge to do all manner of cunning workman&s;hip for it.&mdash;Having entered upon the jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;a|tion, I mu&s;t beg leave &s;till to take a little notice of the Gentile nations, for we have but the&s;e two nations now to &s;peak upon, namely, the Gentiles and the Jews, till I come to the Chri&s;tian aera.</P>
<P>The Canaanites, Phenicians and Sidonians, were very expert in the &s;acred architecture of &s;tone, who being a people of a happy genius and frame of mind, made many great di&s;coveries and improvements of the &s;ciences, as well as in point of learning. The gla&s;s of Sidon, the purple of Tyre, and the exceeding fine linnen they wove, were the product of their own country and their own invention; and for their extraordinary &s;kill

in working of metals, in hewing of timber and &s;tone; in a word, for their perfect knowledge of what was &s;olid in architecture, it need but be remembered that they had in erecting and decorating of the temple at Jeru&s;alem, than which nothing can more redound to their hon|our, or give a clearer idea of what this one building mu&s;t have been.&mdash;Their fame was &s;uch for their ju&s;t ta&s;te, de&s;ign, and ingenious inven|tions, that whatever was elegant, great or plea&s;|ing, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by way of excellence with the epithet of Sidonian.&mdash;The famous temple of Jupiter Hammon, in Libian Africa, was erect|ed, that &s;tood till demoli&s;hed by the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians in tho&s;e parts; but I mu&s;t pa&s;s over many other cities and temples built by the Gentiles.</P>
<P>God having in&s;pired Solomon with wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding, he as grand ma&s;ter and un|dertaker, under God the great architect, &s;ends to Hiram king of Tyre, and after acquainting him of his purpo&s;e of building a hou&s;e unto the name of the Lord his God, he &s;ends to him for &s;ome of his people to go with &s;ome of his, to Mount Lebanon, to cut down and hew cedar trees, as his &s;ervants under&s;tood it better than his own, and moreover he reque&s;ted him to &s;end him a man that was cunning, to work in gold and in &s;ilver, and in bra&s;s, iron, purple, crim&s;on and in blue, and that had &s;kill to engrave with the cunning men, and he &s;ent him Hiram, his name-&s;ake this Hiram, God was plea&s;ed to in|&s;pire

De&s;troy this temple and I will rai&s;e it up again in three days; and the Apo&s;tle, 1 Peter, i. 14. &s;ays, that &s;hortly he &s;hould put off this tabernacle.

<P>It is worthy our notice to con&s;ider the number of Ma&s;ons employed in the work of the Temple: Exclu&s;ive of the two Grand Ma&s;ters, there were 300 princes, or rulers, 3300 over&s;eers of the work, 80000 &s;tone &s;quarers, &s;etters, layers or builders, being able and ingenious Crafts, and 30000 appointed to work in Lebanon, 10000 of which every month, under Adoniram, who was the Grand Warden; all the free Ma&s;ons employ|ed in the work of the Temple was 119,600, be|&s;ides 70,000 men who carried burdens, who were not numbered among Ma&s;ons; the&s;e were

partitioned into certain Lodges, although they were of different nations and different colours, yet were they in perfect harmony among them|&s;elves, and &s;trongly cemented in brotherly love and friend&s;hip, till the glorious Temple of Jeho|vah was fini&s;hed, and the cape-&s;tone was celebrated with great joy&mdash;Having fini&s;hed all that Solomon had to do, they departed unto their &s;everal homes, and carried with them the high ta&s;te of architec|ture to the different parts of the world, and built many other temples and cities in the Gentile nations, under the direction of many wi&s;e and learned and royal Grand Ma&s;ters, as Nebuchad|nezar over Babylon&mdash;Cyrus over the Medes and Per&s;ians&mdash;Alexander over the Macedonians&mdash;Julius Cae&s;ar over Rome, and a great number more I might mention of crowned heads of the Gentile nations who were of the Craft, but this may &s;uffice.&mdash;I mu&s;t ju&s;t mention Herod the Great, before I come to the &s;tate of Ma&s;onry from the birth of our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;This Herod was the greate&s;t builder of his day, the patron and Grand Ma&s;ter of many Lodges; he being in the full enjoyment of peace and plenty, formed a de&s;ign of new building the Temple of Jeru&s;alem. The Temple built by the Jews after the captivity was greatly decayed, being 500 years &s;tanding, he propo&s;ed to the people that he would not take it down till he had all the materials ready for the new, and accordingly he did &s;o, then he took down the old one and built a new one.&mdash;Jo&s;ephus de&s;cribes this Temple as a mo&s;t admirable and magnificent fabric of marble, and

<P>Which brings me to con&s;ider their freedom, and that will appear not only from their being free when accepted, but they have a free inter|cour&s;e with all Lodges over the whole terre&s;tial globe; wherever arts flouri&s;h, a man hath a free right (having a recommendation) to vi&s;it his bre|thren, and they are bound to accept him; the&s;e are the laudable bonds that unite Free Ma&s;ons together in one indi&s;&s;oluble fraternity&mdash;thus in every nation he finds a friend&punc; and in every cli|mate he may find a hou&s;e&mdash;this it is to be kindly affectioned one to another, with brotherly love, in honour preferring one another.</P>

I &s;hall endeavour to draw a few inferences on this di&s;cour&s;e by way of application.&mdash;</P>
<P>My dear Brethren, let us pray to God for a benevolent heart, that we may be enabled to pa&s;s through the various &s;tages of this life with reputa|tion, and that great and infinite Jehovah, who overrules the grand fabric of nature, will enable us to look backward with plea&s;ure, and forward with confidence&mdash;and in the hour of death, and in the day of judgment, the well grounded hope of meeting with that mercy from our Maker which we, have ever been ready to &s;hew to others, will refre&s;h us with the mo&s;t &s;olid comfort, and fill us with the mo&s;t un&s;peakable joy.</P>
<P>And &s;hould not this learn us that new and glorious commandment of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to his di&s;ciples, when he urges it to them in the&s;e words&mdash;Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.&mdash;Our Lord repeats and recommends this as the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able duty and nece&s;&s;ary qualification of his di&s;ciples, &s;aying, hereby &s;hall all men know that ye are my di&s;ciples, if ye have love one to another.&mdash;And we are expre&s;sly told by the Apo&s;tle, that charity, or univer&s;al love and friend|&s;hip, is the end of the commandment.</P>
<P>Shall this noble and unparalleled example fail of its due influence upon us&mdash;&s;hall it not animate our hearts with a like di&s;po&s;ition of benevolence and mercy, &s;hall it not rai&s;e our emulation and provoke our ambition&mdash;to go and do likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us then beware of &s;uch a &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s as pur|&s;ues plea&s;ure at the expence of our neighbour's

<P>The few inferences that have been made on this head mu&s;t be to you, my worthy brethren, of great comfort, that every one may &s;ee the pro|priety of a di&s;cour&s;e on brotherly love before a &s;ociety of free Ma&s;ons&mdash;who knows their engage|ments as men and as chri&s;tians, have &s;uperadded the bonds of this ancient and honourable &s;ociety&mdash;a &s;ociety founded upon &s;uch friendly and comprehen&s;ive principles, that men of all nations and languages, or &s;ects of religion, are and may be admitted and received as members, being re|commended as per&s;ons of a virtuous character.</P>

<P>In a word, let us join with the words of the Apo&s;tle John in the 19th chapter of Revelations, and after the&s;e things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, &s;aying, Alleluia, &s;alvation and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God; for true and righteous are his judgments&mdash;and the four and twenty elders, and the four bea&s;ts, fell down and wor&s;hipped God that &s;at on the throne, &s;aying, Amen; Alle|luia; and a voice came out of the throne, &s;aying, prai&s;e our God, all ye his &s;ervants, and ye that fear him, both &s;mall and great.</P>

To conclude the whole, let it be remembered, that all that is outward, whether opinions, rites or ceremonies, cannot be of importance in regard to eternal &s;alvation, any further than they have a tendency to produce inward righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s&mdash;pure, holy, &s;piritual and benevolent affections can only fit us for the kingdom of hea|ven; and therefore the cultivation of &s;uch mu&s;t needs be the e&s;&s;ence of Chri&s;t's religion.&mdash;God of his infinite mercy grant that we may make this true u&s;e of it. Unhappily, too many Chri&s;tians, &s;o called, take their religion not from the declara|tions of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, but from the writings of tho&s;e they e&s;teem learned.&mdash;But, I am to &s;ay, it is from the New-Te&s;tament only, not from any books what&s;oever, however piou&s;ly wrote, that we ought to &s;eek what is the e&s;&s;ence of Chri&s;t's religion; and it is from this fountain I have endeavoured to give my hearers the idea of Chri&s;tianity in its &s;piritual dre&s;s, free from any human mixtures&mdash;if we have done this wi&s;ely we may expect to enjoy our God in the world that is above&mdash;in which happy place, my dear bre|thren, we &s;hall all, I hope, meet at that great day, when our great Grand Ma&s;ter &s;hall &s;it at the head of the great and glorious Lodge in heaven&mdash;where we &s;hall all meet to part no more for ever and ever&mdash;Amen.</P>
