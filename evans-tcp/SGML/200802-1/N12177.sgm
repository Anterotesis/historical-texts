<BIBL>PSALM CXXXVII: 5. 6.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>If I forget thee, O Jeru&s;alem, let my right hand forget her cunning: If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: If I prefer not Jeru|&s;alem above my chief joy.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>REFLECTION upon pa&s;t enjoyments tends only to the aggravation of pre&s;ent &s;ufferings; and yet, I know not how, the mind of man is ever fondly di&s;po&s;ed to draw the painful parallel betwixt the happine&s;s which he once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and the mi&s;ery which he now feels. This was the ca&s;e of the captive I&s;raelites, as is pathetically de&s;cribed in the p&s;alm be|fore us: <Q>By the rivers of Babylon, &s;ays the divine poet, there we &s;at down, yea, we wept when we re|membered Zion: we hanged our harps upon the willows which grew in the mid&s;t thereof.</Q> As the &s;oul in affliction is ever apt to dwell upon every circum&s;tance which heightens the &s;orrow, he here repre&s;ents his harp, that &s;acred in&s;trument devoted to his GOD, now laid a&s;ide, &s;ilent and neglected; for how indeed could he "&s;ing the LORD'S &s;ong in
<PB REF="015368_0005_0F98D2FDC5181F78">
a &s;trange land?" Oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;ervitude throw a damp upon every noble faculty; no wonder then the &s;acred mu&s;ician could ill exert the heavenly har|mony under the di&s;piriting pre&s;&s;ure of a foreign ty|ranny. How &s;hall we &s;ing the LORD'S &s;ong in a &s;trange land? Here the faithful patriot turns, by a very natural tran&s;ition, from lamenting over his country's fate, to the &s;tronge&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of pre|&s;erving his affection forever inviolable towards her, <Q>If I forget thee, O Jeru&s;alem! let my right hand forget her cunning: If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: If I prefer not Jeru&s;alem above my chief joy.</Q></P>
<P>UNDER the incitement of &s;o animating an example, I &s;hall offer a few &s;entiments concerning that virtue which produced this glorious re&s;olution; and, after endeavouring to explain the nature and obligation of love to our country, &s;hall attempt to point out that conduct which &s;eems requi&s;ite to te&s;tify the &s;incerity of this affection.</P>
<P>THE love of our country is a principle which hath been more celebrated in all ages, hath been the &s;ubject of more prai&s;e and panegyric, than any other affection in the whole train of virtue. It hath been the con&s;tant theme of poets, orators and hi&s;to|rians; &s;tatues and medals have been erected and &s;truck, and all the trea&s;ures of art and wit perpetu|ally exhau&s;ted, in doing honour to tho&s;e who have
<PB REF="015368_0006_0F98D2FE8620EC88">
excelled in this character: And indeed the name of Patriot implies, in its true &s;en&s;e, every thing that is mo&s;t great and godlike among men; it carries in it the idea of a public ble&s;&s;ing; it implies a power of doing good, exerted and extended to whole com|munities; and re&s;embles, within its &s;phere, that univer&s;al providence which protects and &s;upports the world. This is that elevated pa&s;&s;ion, of all others the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, as well as mo&s;t becoming, to mankind; and yet, if we believe the common com|plaints, of all others the lea&s;t vi&s;ible in the world. It lives, we are told, rather in de&s;cription than reality, and is repre&s;ented by the fir&s;t writer of this age as an antiquated and forgotten virtue. Wretched picture of the human race! If this be a ju&s;t repre|&s;entation, we are degenerate indeed! in&s;en&s;ible to the be&s;t of all &s;ocial duties, counteracting the com|mon bond of alliance with our &s;pecies, and check|ing the &s;ource of our mo&s;t refined plea&s;ures. The public is, as it were, one great family; we are all children of one common mother, <HI>America,</HI> our country; &s;he gives us all our birth, nur&s;ed our ten|der years, and &s;upports our manhood. In this light, therefore, our regards for her &s;eem as natural as the implanted affection betwixt parents and children.</P>
<P>I might here enlarge on the mutual delights given and received in the &s;ocial entertainments and conver&s;ation of a people connected together with
<PB REF="015368_0007_0F98D2FF451AD6C8">
the &s;ame language, cu&s;toms and in&s;titutions, and from thence &s;hew the rea&s;onablene&s;s of an af|fectionate attachment to the community, but I chu&s;e to point out the obligations to this a&s;&s;ociating virtue as they ari&s;e from higher and more intere&s;t|ing principles.</P>
<P>THE mi&s;eries of the &s;tate of nature are &s;o evident that there is no occa&s;ion to di&s;play them; every man is &s;en&s;ible that violence, rapine and &s;laughter mu&s;t be continually practi&s;ed where no re&s;traints are provided to curb the inordinancy of &s;elf-affection. To &s;ociety then we mu&s;t owe our &s;ecurity from the&s;e mi&s;eries, and to a wi&s;ely con&s;tructed and well regulated government we mu&s;t &s;tand indebted for our protection again&s;t tho&s;e, who would encroach upon the equal &s;hare of liberty which belongs to all, or would mole&s;t individuals in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what is fairly appropriated, or ju&s;tly claimed. And what an un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction is it to be free, and to be able to call any thing one's own! Free|dom and &s;ecurity diffu&s;e a cheerfulne&s;s over the mo&s;t uncomfortable regions, and give a value to the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; even a mor&s;el of bread in the mo&s;t frozen climate would be more worth contending for, if liberty crowned the meal, than the noble&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and greate&s;t affluence under the milde&s;t &s;kies, if held at the mercile&s;s will of a civil or religious tyrant. And as &s;uch a happi|ne&s;s is only to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the love of &s;ociety;
<PB N="9" REF="015368_0008_0F98D30004673E38">
as all the ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy &s;pring from this &s;ource; gratitude calls upon us to cultivate a principle to which we owe &s;uch tran&s;cendent obligations. But the obligation ri&s;es upon us, when we con&s;ider, that from &s;ociety is al&s;o derived a &s;et of amiable duties, unknown to men in a detached and uncon|nected &s;tate. It is from this foundation that ho&s;pita|lity, gratitude and genero&s;ity flow, with all the plea&s;ing charities which adorn human nature; for, where have tho&s;e virtues their theatre? where is their &s;cene of action? or how can they exert them&s;elves, but in &s;ociety? It is there alone we have opportunities of di&s;playing the moral charms, and of exhibiting the glorious manife&s;tation of good-will to mankind. On this account, therefore, &s;ociety has a high demand for our affectionate regard.</P>
<P>BUT to be unmindful of the public, is not only an argument of an <HI>ungrateful,</HI> it is a proof al&s;o of a <HI>di&s;hone&s;t</HI> temper of mind. GOD has a&s;&s;igned each of us our &s;tation, and a part which we are obliged to di&s;charge in carrying on the great work of &s;ocial happine&s;s. If then I neglect the part appointed me, I am highly unju&s;t; becau&s;e I take a &s;hare of the benefits of &s;ociety, and yet leave the burden to be borne by others. A greater inju&s;tice than this can &s;carcely be conceived. He who injures parti|culars, is indeed an offender; but he who with|holds from the public the &s;ervice and affection to
<PB REF="015368_0009_0F98D300C4675990">
which it is intitled, is a criminal of a far higher de|gree, as he thereby robs a whole body of people, and deprives the community of her ju&s;t demand. If GOD has given to one man a good under&s;tanding, and he does not exert it for the general advantage by advice and coun&s;el; if to another riches, and he will not a&s;&s;i&s;t with his liberality; if to a poor man &s;trength, and he will not aid with his labour; if, in &s;hort, any be wanting in pur&s;uing the benevolent principle, by directing his talents to their proper ends, he de&s;erves to be treated as a common &s;poiler, ina&s;much as he takes what properly belongs not to him, the title of each man's &s;hare of the benefits of &s;ociety ari&s;ing only from that proportion which he him&s;elf has contributed.</P>
<P>PUBLIC good is, as it were, a common bank, in which every individual has his re&s;pective &s;hare; and con&s;equently whatever damage that &s;u&s;tains, the individuals unavoidably partake of the calamity. If liberty be de&s;troyed, no particular member can e&s;cape the chains; if the credit of the a&s;&s;ociated body &s;ink, his fortune &s;inks with it; if the &s;ons of violence prevail, and plunder the public &s;tock, his part cannot be re&s;cued from the &s;poil; and &s;ome real &s;hare (be it more or le&s;s) all, even the meane&s;t, have in this common fund, and a valuable one too, though it were nothing but the lowe&s;t earnings of indu&s;trious labour. If, then, we have a true af|fection for our&s;elves; if we would reap the fruits of
<PB N="11" REF="015368_0010_0F98D30185E9AC00">
indu&s;try, and enjoy our property in &s;ecurity, we mu&s;t &s;tand firm to the cau&s;e of liberty and public virtue, otherwi&s;e we had better return to the raw herbage for our food; to the inclemencies of the open &s;ky for our covering; go back beyond the mountains to uncultivated nature, where our wants would be fewer, and our appetites le&s;s. Such a &s;ituation, notwith&s;tanding all its inconveniences, is far preferable to a tyrannical government, and far more de&s;irable than the lot of &s;laves.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee then how clo&s;ely the kind Creator has connected our intere&s;t with our duty, and made it each man's happine&s;s to contribute to the welfare of his country.</P>
<P>BUT &s;till the more noble motive to a generous &s;oul is that which &s;prings from a benevolent de&s;ire of diffu&s;ing the joys of life to all around him. There is nothing he thinks &s;o de&s;irable as to be the in&s;tru|ment of doing good; and the further it is extend|ed, the greater is the delight, and the more glorious his character. Benignity to friends and relations is but a narrow-&s;pirited quality compared with this, and perhaps as frequently the effect of caprice or pride as of a benevolent temper. But when our flow of good-will &s;preads it&s;elf to all the &s;ociety, and in them to di&s;tant po&s;terity; when charity ri&s;es into public &s;pirit, and partial affection is extended into general benevolence, then it is that man &s;hines in
<PB REF="015368_0011_0F98D303BAB7FF68">
the highe&s;t lu&s;tre, and is the true&s;t image of his Divine Maker.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid in fa|vour of this affection, laudable as it is, we are not, however, to forget, that it may be &s;o conducted as to become a very criminal pa&s;&s;ion. If any a&s;&s;ocia|ted body, apprehending them&s;elves &s;uperior to other &s;tates, &s;hould, for that rea&s;on only, invade their rights, this would be to undermine the very foundation of &s;ociety, and con&s;equently an unju&s;ti|fiable enterprize. Does true patrioti&s;m in&s;pire &s;uch a conduct? Does the love of our country teach us to aggrandize it at the ruin of another? Un|doubtedly not. And if we think at all, we mu&s;t allow &s;uch attempts utterly repugnant to the fun|damental laws of ju&s;tice and univer&s;al charity. Hard would be his fate who &s;hould be commanded to perform &s;uch a &s;ervice, and glorious the triumph of his &s;oul if he re&s;olved to decline it! In vain would he call in the example of ancient Rome for his encou|ragement; for, after all the extravagant encomiums be&s;towed upon her patrioti&s;m, we &s;hall &s;carce be able to clear it from the imputation of flagrant tyranny. Rome, early po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the high fa|natici&s;m of di&s;tinction and empire, declared war again&s;t mankind, and out of a feveri&s;h fondne&s;s for dominion and renown, laid de&s;olate all the known world. Their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, their habitations, their paintings, their &s;culptures, all their riches
<PB REF="015368_0012_0F98D303CBA47FD0">
were the &s;poils of injured nations. Thus they erected to them&s;elves an empire as unweildy as it was unju&s;t, on the ruins of their fellow-creatures. What then are all their beautiful lectures and pompous declamations on the love of their country? What their laboured orations in prai&s;e of liberty? Indi&s;putable proofs, indeed, of their eloquence, but not &s;o of their humanity. If the language of benevolence were to con&s;titute the patriotic cha|racter, you mu&s;t allow it due to the&s;e Romans; but if actions are to a&s;certain the right, we &s;hall find it a difficult ta&s;k to make good their claim, though we were ma&s;ters even of their own eloquence.</P>
<P>Look into their city, and behold the inhabitants; there you will find this celebrated freedom &s;pread|ing it&s;elf only among&s;t particular branches, and giving a few the licen&s;e to tyranni&s;e over an infinite number of mi&s;erable &s;laves, rendered more wretched by having always before their eyes a di&s;agreeable &s;ubject of compari&s;on. Look into their provinces, (which they ought in duty to have protected) and you behold &s;cenes of the utmo&s;t inju&s;tice, barbarity and horror. Their tyrants, not content with what might with &s;ome degree of propriety be called law|ful taxation, but murdering them in cold blood without mercy. Now and then, it is true, you &s;ee the conquered enjoying a little ea&s;e under a humane, hone&s;t governor; but in general their oppre&s;&s;ions were intolerable, and their whole
<PB REF="015368_0013_0F98D30484DA4F40">
admini&s;tration no better than a cour&s;e of ho&s;tility and plunder.</P>
<P>LET us change the &s;cene, and take a cur&s;ory view of our own ca&s;e. Thanks and prai&s;e be given to the LORD GOD of armies, it is our felicity not to be members of &s;uch a &s;ociety! not to be in &s;o abject and humiliating a &s;tate as tho&s;e Roman colonies were! We have never yet been conquered; we never yet tamely received laws from a tyrant, nor never will, while the cau&s;e of religion, the cau&s;e of nature and of nature's GOD cry aloud, or even whi&s;per <HI>re&s;i&s;tance</HI> to an oppre&s;&s;or's execrated power. The gloomy cloud that has long been gathering and hovering over our Jeru&s;alem, is indeed &s;till formidable, and demands our utmo&s;t efforts to ef|fectuate its di&s;per&s;ion; and this great and wi&s;hed for good is in all human probability the mo&s;t likely to be accompli&s;hed by firmne&s;s, unanimity, per&s;everance and a fixed determination &s;trenu|ou&s;ly to execute and defend what our Continental Congre&s;s, Provincial A&s;&s;emblies, Commanding Of|ficers, and &s;o forth, &s;hall wi&s;ely and prudently re&s;olve.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Let fools for modes of</HI> government <HI>conte&s;t,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That which is be&s;t admini&s;ter'd is be&s;t.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>AND here I will ob&s;erve, that it was not through licentious oppo&s;ition, or for conque&s;t, we drew the
<PB REF="015368_0014_0F98D305447860F0">
&s;word, but for ju&s;tice; not to introduce, but to prevent &s;lavery; not upon a vain principle of am|bition to gratify the re&s;entment or pride of any in|dividuals, (as many of our internal enemies have &s;tupidly and fal&s;ely a&s;&s;erted) but in defence of the plaine&s;t rights, and &s;uch as all mankind have ever claimed at the call of a provoked and long injured people, and that after every other method of redre&s;s had been tried in vain.</P>
<P>THE liberty we contend for is not the licen&s;e of a few to tyranni&s;e over multitudes; but an equal freedom to all, &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the pre|&s;ent circum&s;tances of our country, good order, the con&s;titution, and peace of government. The&s;e are circum&s;tances which give a &s;anction to patrioti&s;m, and not only ju&s;tify, but demand our mo&s;t active re&s;olutions to promote the welfare of our country, by all tho&s;e methods which become a civilized and numerous people, born with an in&s;tinctive love of liberty.</P>
<P>IF we bear a true and cordial affection for our country, we &s;hall be warm and active in her cau&s;e; a calm concern is incon&s;i&s;tent with true patrioti&s;m, which gives ardor to the colde&s;t brea&s;t, and makes even cowards brave.</P>
<P>THERE never was a country had &s;tronger motives
<PB REF="015368_0015_0F98D30604A95C00">
to unite in active zeal than this, nor was there ever a time required it more than the pre&s;ent. By how much the more the enjoyment of liberty hath been a&s;&s;erted, improved and e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t us; &s;o much the greater ought to be our re&s;olution to maintain it, and the more &s;candalous is our folly if we lo&s;e it. Liberty with danger is better than &s;lavery with &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>OF all the known parts of the world, and for many ages, Britain hath been the mo&s;t extolled for the love and protection of liberty; there the heavenly godde&s;s &s;eemed to have fixed her temple; and whil&s;t her &s;acred fires have been extingui&s;hed in &s;o many other countries, there they have till lately been religiou&s;ly kept alive; there &s;he hath had her &s;aints and confe&s;&s;ors, and a whole army of martyrs: But, alas! how are the mighty fallen! The gates of hell hath prevailed again&s;t her.</P>
<P>IF then liberty be that delicious and whole&s;ome fruit on which the Briti&s;h nation hath fed for ages, and to which they owe their riches, their &s;trength, and all the advantages they boa&s;t of, &s;urely it is highly incumbent upon us to cheri&s;h and cultivate the tree which bears that delicious fruit, and will continue to bear it as long as we are careful to fence it in and trench it round again&s;t the bea&s;ts of the field and in&s;ects of the earth. It is then our duty to be ever vigorous and ardent in the &s;upport of
<PB REF="015368_0016_0F98D306C762EA38">
&s;uch a cau&s;e; to reverence the maje&s;ty of liberty, and conform our conduct to it; to cau&s;e all other inclinations to bow to this; to make it, in &s;hort, the con&s;tant object of our warme&s;t wi&s;hes, clo&s;e&s;t attention and highe&s;t admiration <Q>to prefer Jeru|&s;alem above our chief joy.</Q></P>
<P>WE &s;hall give a further proof of our patrioti&s;m, if, out of a &s;en&s;e of the obligations we lie under to tho&s;e on whom the execution or management of our glorious cau&s;e is delegated, we endeavour to &s;trengthen their hands, oil the wheels of patriotic power, and &s;mooth the rugged paths of their ad|mini&s;tration. Whil&s;t they di&s;charge their important duties with ability and honour, they have a ju&s;t demand to the returns of grateful acknowledge|ments, and are entitled to the warme&s;t applau&s;es of that people whom they have faithfully &s;erved. And as it is incumbent upon us to pay this tribute, &s;o it is natural for them to expect it. Glory is the re|ward of honourable toils, and public fame is the ju&s;t retribution for public &s;ervice; the love of which is &s;o connected with virtue, that it &s;eems &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the latter with|out &s;ome degree of the former. Nor is this any &s;ort of derogation to the benevolence of the character: A good man feels a plea&s;ure from the reputation he acquires by &s;erving his country, becau&s;e he loves it; but he does not love it merely for the &s;ake of that plea&s;ure; the pa&s;&s;ion did not &s;pring from the
<PB N="18" REF="015368_0017_0F98D307847F7D40">
expectation of the delight, but the delight was the con&s;equence of the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT after all the&s;e duties are di&s;charged, we mu&s;t not &s;top here, &s;omething more is &s;till required at our hands to give the fini&s;hing te&s;timony: If the love of your country is indeed the governing prin|ciple of your &s;oul, you will give up every inclina|tion which is incompatible with it; nor will you cheri&s;h in your brea&s;ts any rivals of the favorite pa&s;&s;ion. All the train of darling vices mu&s;t there|fore be brought forth, and offered up as victims on the altars of liberty. You cannot be &s;aid to "pre|fer Jeru&s;alem above your chief joy," whil&s;t you fo&s;ter any appetites which have a manife&s;t tendency to her detriment. But what is &s;o pernicious to the common weal as vice? and what vice &s;o much as luxury? It is this which enfeebles the body, cor|rupts the mind, impoveri&s;hes the fortune, and in|troduces every baneful cau&s;e of ruin. This it was which de&s;troyed imperial Rome, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted Cae&s;ar to en&s;lave her citizens. She had &s;trength enough left her to with&s;tand the attacks of her enemies; but tho&s;e who &s;eemed to wi&s;h her pro&s;perity had not virtue enough to give up their luxury to her intere&s;t. Rome, therefore, fell a &s;acrifice to the vices of her friends. Effects always corre&s;pond to their cau&s;es: If we pur&s;ue the &s;ame cour&s;e, we mu&s;t expect the &s;ame fate.</P>

THIS con&s;ideration is &s;urely &s;ufficient to rou&s;e our virtue, and make us abandon all intemperate pur&s;uits. But if out of a luxurious vanity we con|&s;ume the manufactures of other countries, to the detriment of our own; if our profu&s;ion in extra|vagant expences render us le&s;s able, or le&s;s willing, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the public, we violate the mo&s;t &s;acred of all &s;ocial duties, and become flagrant tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the will of our Creator.</P>
<P>IT was &s;uch a conduct as this which provoked the anger of GOD again&s;t the I&s;raelites, when he &s;ent his prophet (Amos) to them with this denun|ciation: <Q>Wo unto them that are at ea&s;e in Zion! ye that put far away the evil day, and cau&s;e the &s;eat of violence to come near! That lie upon beds of ivory, and &s;tretch them&s;elves upon their couches, eat the lambs out of the flock, and calves out of the mid&s;t of the &s;tall; that chant to the &s;ound of the viol, and invent to them&s;elves in&s;truments of mu&s;ic; that drink wine out of bowls, and anoint them&s;elves with their chief ointments: but are not grieved for the af|fliction of Jo&s;eph!</Q> A beautiful and pathetic de|&s;cription this of the levity of the Hebrews; who, at a time of public di&s;tre&s;s, regarded only the in|dulgence of voluptuous appetites, but never felt one tender &s;entiment for their bleeding country, "were not grieved for the affliction of Jo&s;eph." Thus the children of I&s;rael were brought down (&s;ays

the &s;cripture) in that day, and the children of Judah prevailed, becau&s;e they relied on the LORD their GOD. The&s;e things were written for our ad|monition, as well as the Jews; and the wo de|nounced is equally applicable to any other nation in the like circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>LET us then not build too much upon human pro&s;pects, or &s;hut GOD out of our councils and de|&s;igns; but let us flee humbly to him for &s;uccour in a pious acknowledgment, that <Q>without him nothing is &s;trong; that without him no king can be &s;aved by the multitude of an ho&s;t, nor the mightie&s;t man be delivered by his &s;trength.</Q></P>
<P>OUR unnatural enemies have their earthly king, their lords &s;piritual and temporal, to apply to on this occa&s;ion; let us leave them to their protection, and let us chu&s;e on our part the LORD of lords for our GOD and for our king. In his name have we &s;et up our banners, who alone <Q>giveth victory un|to kings, and &s;aveth from the peril of the &s;word.</Q> Let us every one contribute his endeavour to re|duce and le&s;&s;en the weight of public guilt by at lea&s;t reforming and amending him&s;elf, and unite in our prayers and in every good work, that <Q>GOD may be entreated for the land.</Q> So we may pi|ou&s;ly hope, that he will go forth with our armies, and "command deliverances for Jacob;" that thro' him we &s;hall <Q>ca&s;t down our enemies, and keep

them under that ri&s;e up again&s;t us.</Q> So &s;hall we not only con&s;ult the peace and pro&s;perity of this our Jeru&s;alem, but &s;hall provide in the be&s;t manner for our future peace and happine&s;s in a better country, and &s;hall be received as true &s;ons and citi|zens of that Jeru&s;alem which is above.</P>
<P>TO conclude: Temperance and patrioti&s;m go hand in hand, and adhere together by an in&s;eparable connection. And as there can be no real virtue in that brea&s;t, which is not &s;u&s;ceptible of the love of the public, &s;o there can be no genuine love of the public where virtue is wanting; &s;ince that is not only the true&s;t ornament, but the be&s;t &s;upport of the community. National affection therefore, if it be derived from a true principle, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily in&s;pire a moral conduct, mu&s;t incline us to quit every baneful vice, to contract the circle even of what we call innocent amu&s;ements, and in&s;tead of looking out for daily parties of plea&s;ure, it will prompt us rather to make a con&s;tant fe&s;tival of human kindne&s;s, the mo&s;t delicious of all enter|tainments to a generous mind. If we behave thus, then we are patriots indeed. It is thus we are to arm our&s;elves again&s;t our unprincipled enemies; who, though they &s;hould not dread our &s;trength, will certainly &s;tand in awe of our virtue. Whil&s;t we act in this manner, our profe&s;&s;ions will not only meet with full applau&s;e from men, but al&s;o with the approbation of GOD, when with the pious ar|dor
