<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH publi&s;hers of receipts have been always very numerous, yet it has &s;o happened, that the lea&s;t able have hitherto undertaken this ta&s;k, as the mo&s;t ea&s;y and likely to an&s;wer any mercenary views; which &s;eems to have been the rea&s;on that more able per&s;ons have neglected it as an under part of their profe&s;&s;ion. Neverthele&s;s, I have per&s;uaded my&s;elf, that I &s;hould per|form a work, neither entirely void of u&s;e, nor foreign to the duties of my profe&s;&s;ion, if I made the public partakers of the principal helps again&s;t mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es, which I had either learned by long experience, or &s;elected from the writings of the mo&s;t eminent phy|&s;icians. As the&s;e receipts are publi&s;hed chief|ly for the u&s;e of per&s;ons re&s;iding in the coun|try, who&s;e convenience or abilities, will not

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE favourable reception this work has met with, as is &s;ufficiently &s;hewn by the remarkable quick &s;ale of the fir&s;t large impre&s;&s;ion, has induced the editor (to &s;up|port the credit of what is really beneficial to the public, and add weight to the receipts) to publi&s;h the authorities from whence tho&s;e receipts were taken; and to make it &s;till more u&s;eful, has added the &s;igns of di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;ome plain and conci&s;e directions for bleeding: he begs leave to remark, that although Dr. Theobald hath in general given no more than one receipt for the cure of one di&s;order, yet he has been careful to &s;elect &s;uch, <HI>only,</HI> as upon long experience were found to be the be&s;t; and that although receipts are given for di&s;ea&s;es which are &s;eldom cured, (as an apoplexy, con&s;umption, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) yet if it is in the power of medicine to remove any of the&s;e complaints, there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to imagine, that the remedies directed in this pamphlet will effect a cure.</P>

<P>As &s;everal circum&s;tances may happen to have continued life in &s;uch an unfortunate &s;ituation, beyond the u&s;ual term, we &s;hould always endeavour to afford them the mo&s;t effec|tual relief, and not give them up as irrecoverable too &s;oon; &s;ince it has been often known that, till after the expiration of &s;everal hours, &s;uch bodies have &s;hewn &s;ome apparent tokens of life. Fir&s;t, the wet cloaths &s;hould be &s;tripped off, and the body &s;trongly rubbed with dry coar&s;e cloths, and put as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible into a well heated bed; and this rubbing mu&s;t be continued a con&s;iderable time to|gether. Some per&s;on &s;hould force his own warm breath into the drowned per&s;on's lungs, and al&s;o the &s;moke of tobacco by means of a pipe or funnel introduced into the mouth, &s;topping the &s;ufferer's no&s;trils clo&s;e at the &s;ame time. If a &s;urgeon can be procured, the jugular vein, or any large vein in the neck, &s;hould be opened, and ten or
<PB N="13" REF="010783_0026_0F86F0DB4B8D36E0">
twelve ounces of blood taken away. This vein is to be preferred, becau&s;e it is &s;eldom that any other vein will af|ford any quantity of blood under the&s;e circum&s;tances. The &s;moke of tobacco &s;hould al&s;o be thrown up into the bowels by the fundament, by introducing the &s;mall end of a tobacco pipe well lighted up, the bowl of it wrapped up in a paper in which &s;everal holes are pricked, and through the&s;e the breath is to be &s;trongly forced. Two pipes, may be thus lighted and applied, the one to the anus, and the other to the mouth, at the &s;ame time. The &s;tronge&s;t volatiles &s;hould al&s;o be applied to the patient's no&s;trils. It is u&s;ele&s;s, and even dangerous, to pour much liquid of any kind into the mouth, as long as the patient &s;hews no &s;igns of life; but as &s;oon as he di&s;covers any motion, he &s;hould take five or &s;ix &s;poonfuls of a &s;trong decoction of carduus benedictus &s;weetned with honey; and, if nothing el&s;e can be had, &s;ome warm water, with the addition of a little common &s;alt.

The method of rolling them in an empty hog&s;head is dangerous, and lo&s;es a deal of important time. The hanging them up by the feet is al&s;o dangerous, and &s;hould be di&s;continued, &s;ince the froth, which is one of the cau&s;es of their death, is too thick and vi&s;cid to di&s;charge it&s;elf by its own weight, and this po&s;ture tends to increa&s;e the over-fulne&s;s of the head and lungs. The covering the per&s;on with hot a&s;hes, hot &s;and, or hot &s;alt, has often &s;ucceeded, and may be tried, but &s;hould not make the a&s;&s;i&s;tants le&s;s attentive to the other methods already directed to be u&s;ed for the recovery of the drowned per&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>MILK FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;order happens about the third or fourth day after delivery, and is owing to the conge&s;tion of milk in the brea&s;ts; it is attended with &s;hivering fits like an ague, ten&s;ion and &s;welling in the brea&s;ts, that extends to the arm-pits, which parts are often extremely painful. This fever continues a day or two, and &s;ometime goes off of it&s;elf, by the benefit of nature, in plentiful &s;weats, pro|portionable to the preceding cold fits.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD>METHOD OF CURE.</HEAD>
<P>The patient &s;hould drink plentifully of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> thin di|luting liquors, as balm tea, barley-water, &amp;c. her diet &s;hould be very &s;lender, and the child &s;hould be often put to the brea&s;t. Internally the following powder &s;hould be taken every &s;ix hours, in a cup of balm-tea; take com|pound powder of contrayerva, twenty-five grains; purified nitre, five grains; and mix them together for one do&s;e.</P>
<P>But if the woman does not intend to give &s;uck, &s;he mu&s;t rigorou&s;ly adhere to a very &s;lender diet, and the fore|going medicine; the brea&s;ts &s;hould al&s;o be drawn by &s;ome proper per&s;on; and, to prevent the milk from coagu|lating, the brea&s;ts mu&s;t be embrocated with warm &s;allad|oil, or the leaf of a red cabbage may be applied thereto. If there is rea&s;on to apprehend an inflammation of the brea&s;ts, it will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to lo&s;e eight ounces of blood from the arm. Folded cloths dipt in brandy or vinegar, placed under the arm-pits, are al&s;o of &s;ervice to drive back the milk.</P>

<HEAD>Directions for pre&s;erving Health, and attaining long Life.</HEAD>
<P>HEALTH has been ever e&s;teemed the fir&s;t of ble&s;|&s;ings, and con&s;equently every endeavour towards its pre&s;ervation, de&s;erves encouragement. This con&s;idera|tion induces me to publi&s;h the following remarks, from a thorough conviction of the truth they contain; which ought, with every hone&s;t man, to outweigh every timi|dity of its reception, and give him courage to offer, at all ri&s;ques, what, by well-grounded experience, appears to him, (from its nature) of general utility to mankind.</P>
<P>The air, which is a fluid ela&s;tic &s;ub&s;tance that &s;urrounds us on all &s;ides, penetrates our bodies, and yet is &s;o fine, that it e&s;capes the &s;ight, is rarified by heat, and con|den&s;ed by cold: it is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that an animal cannot live a moment without it; it &s;erves for re&s;piration or breathing, and is &s;u&s;ceptible of different qualities; it may be hot, moi&s;t, cold, dry, &s;erene, pure, and temperate. It is &s;ubject to variations more or le&s;s &s;udden, and to be mixed with impure, corrupted, infectious vapours, which are prejudicial to health. The &s;udden changes of the air are dangerous; whence proceed a great number of di&s;|ea&s;es which reign in the &s;pring and autumn. Towards the approach of winter, ho&s;pitals, pri&s;ons, places where armies are encamped, places where lead is melted, and the earth ju&s;t thrown up, near dunghills, &amp;c. are unhealthy, on account of the bad exhalations. Too hot an air occa&s;ions malignant and putrid fevers: a cold and moi&s;t con&s;titu|tion of the air produces coughs, pleuri&s;ies, rheumati&s;ms, agues, &amp;c. for in&s;tance, agues are common in the Fens of Cambridge&s;hire and Lincoln&s;hire, and the Hundreds of E&s;&s;ex, on account of their mar&s;hy &s;ituation, and the moi&s;t vapours which weaken the fibres of the body, and ob|&s;truct the pores of the &s;kin, and con&s;equently dimini&s;h the di&s;charge of the &s;kin, called in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration. Hence it appears, that, to pre&s;erve health, dunghills &s;hould never be placed too near the dwelling-hou&s;e, &s;ince the cor|rupted vapours which are continually exhaling from them, cannot &s;ail being in time prejudicial, and cau&s;ing malig|nant fevers; for though tho&s;e who are u&s;ed to them, do
<PB N="42" REF="010783_0057_0F86F10123F093A8">
not preceive their offen&s;ivene&s;s, yet the cau&s;e does not cea&s;e its unwhol&s;ome activity.</P>
<P>From what has been ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to ho&s;pitals and jails, the nece&s;&s;ity of daily opening the windows of a bedchamber mu&s;t clearly appear, to prevent the bad con|&s;equences which ari&s;e from &s;oul and confined air; and why hou&s;es &s;hould be built rather rai&s;ed above the level of the earth, than &s;unk beneath its &s;urface; and the expo&s;ure of the front &s;hould be to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, this being the mo&s;t whole&s;ome a&s;pect.</P>
<P>Our con&s;titution, from the lo&s;s it daily &s;u&s;tains, re|quires to be repaired by aliment and drink; hence a know|ledge of their general kinds and qualities is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to make a proper choice thereof.</P>
<P>The principal and mo&s;t general food is bread, made of wheat, barley, rye, or oats: wheaten bread is mo&s;t nou|ri&s;hing; barley is dry; rye and oats laxative. The cru&s;t is mo&s;t ea&s;y of dige&s;tion; the crumb more oily and heavy; though other mealy &s;ub&s;tances, beans, pea&s;e, potatoes, &amp;c. nouri&s;h much, but are windy, heavy, and vi&s;cid, and their con&s;tant u&s;e is apt to cau&s;e ob&s;tructions, unle&s;s a great deal of exerci&s;e is u&s;ed. Rice is emollient and nou|ri&s;hing; but nuts, almonds, and che&s;nuts, &amp;c. though they abound with nutritious particles, are hard of di|ge&s;tion.</P>
<P>Pulpy, tart fruits, which abound with juice, eaten ripe, are refre&s;hing, cooling, quench thir&s;t, and are ea&s;y of di|ge&s;tion; &s;uch as &s;trawberries, ra&s;berries, currants, mul|berries, goo&s;eberries, cherries, apples, pears, appricots, peaches, nectarines, &amp;c. Remark, contrary to the com|mon prejudice which generally prevails, that fruits are hurtful in the bloody flux, and even occa&s;ion this di&s;or|der, they may be eaten with great &s;afety in the bloody flux, and are indeed the real pre&s;ervatives again&s;t it, as is confirmed by the experience of the mo&s;t eminent phy&s;i|cians: the cau&s;e of this di&s;order being an exce&s;s of fle&s;h meats, too moi&s;t a &s;tate of the air, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cold &s;howers to violent heats, and uncleanline&s;s. In fact, this di&s;order has been ob&s;erved le&s;s frequent, and le&s;s dan|gerous, when fruits were plenty and cheap; &s;o that to e&s;cape this di&s;temper when it is ri&s;e, ripe fruits are to be eaten in plenty, and the quantity of fle&s;h meats are to be le&s;&s;ened con&s;iderably.</P>

<P>Liquid aliments, are milk, eggs, chocolate, &s;oups, broths, &amp;c. Milk, requiring but little preparation in the &s;tomach, is a good <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> for per&s;ons who&s;e &s;tomachs are weak, and children; new-laid eggs are very nouri&s;h|ing, and ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, therefore agree with exhau&s;ted and old per&s;ons. Chocolate nouri&s;hes greatly, &s;trengthens the &s;tomach, helps dige&s;tion, and &s;oftens &s;harp humours; whence it is proper for weak &s;tomachs and con&s;umptive per&s;ons. Broths and &s;oups abound with a &s;oft, moi&s;tning, nutritious jelly, whence they are great re&s;toratives. Meat that is roa&s;ted, contains an excellent nouri&s;hing juice, the moi&s;t parts being di&s;&s;ipated by the fire. Things that are tried, are only proper for &s;trong &s;tomachs.</P>
<P>Drink re&s;tores the fluid parts of the body, and helps di|ge&s;tion; the principal and mo&s;t &s;alutary is water, of which the &s;ofte&s;t is be&s;t, which is known by its lathering ea&s;ily with &s;oap; but taken in too great quantities, it re|laxes and weakens the &s;tomach, and cau&s;es many di&s;or|ders. Wine in moderation &s;trengthens the &s;olids, and promotes dige&s;tion; but if u&s;ed in exce&s;s, as well as bran|dy, rum, and all other &s;pirituous liquors, hardens the fi|bres, weakens the nerves, de&s;troys the appetite, and cau&s;es gout, &s;tone, and other chronic di&s;ea&s;es; that malt liquor is the whole&s;ome&s;t which is the lighte&s;t and cleare&s;t; for then it does not offend the &s;tomach, but pa&s;&s;es readily

Tea, u&s;ed in moderation, promotes per&s;piration, or the di&s;charge by the &s;kin, &s;trengthens the &s;tomach, and helps dige&s;tion; but that kind of tea which is called hy&s;on, is improper for per&s;ons who have weak nerves or &s;ubject to hy&s;teric di&s;orders. Coffee, drank after dinner, is thought to quicken dige&s;tion, and allay the fumes of wine; but if u&s;ed in exce&s;s, it agitates the blood, cau&s;es watching, and promotes hemorrhages or bleedings from the no&s;e, or other parts.</P>
<P>Spices, pepper, &amp;c. are pernicious, when u&s;ed to create an appetite; whence made di&s;hes are bad; for the appe|tite cau&s;ed by the quality and difference of the victuals, in|cites per&s;ons to eat more than the &s;tomach can well di|ge&s;t; which cau&s;es indige&s;tion, and frequently dangerous and fatal di&s;orders. With re&s;pect to diet, the &s;ure&s;t me|thod of pre&s;erving health, is to live on plain, &s;imple food, lightly &s;ea&s;on'd, in that quantity which, by experience, nature has been found to require. Perfect dige&s;tion is the be&s;t rule for regulating a meal, which is known from per|&s;ons being more lively and bri&s;k after a meal than before. Hi&s;tory furni&s;hes us with many examples of per&s;ons, who, by temperance, has lived to a very advanced age, though of weakly con&s;titutions naturally; wherefore tho&s;e that are de&s;irous of life and health, &s;hould imitate their man|ner of living; &s;ince exce&s;&s;es in eating and drinking are both extremely dangerous.</P>
<P>Strong, robu&s;t, young people, who u&s;e much exerci&s;e, ought to eat more than others, and may be free with the gro&s;&s;er kinds of food; for their &s;tomachs being &s;trong, the lighter foods would dige&s;t too ea&s;ily, and be di&s;&s;ipated too &s;oon. Per&s;ons of a weak con&s;titution, or who are ju&s;t recovered from a di&s;ea&s;e, &s;hould u&s;e &s;oft, light foods, agreeable to the &s;tomach. Children, who&s;e &s;tomachs are weak, and ve&s;&s;els fine, ought to u&s;e a light, thin, &s;oft

Nur&s;es &s;hould ob&s;erve an exact diet, and &s;hun violent pa&s;&s;ions of all kinds; for they di&s;turb dige&s;|tion, and communicate their bad effects to the child. When children are weaned, they &s;hould not be accu&s;to|med to &s;pirituous liquors, or &s;trong food, e&s;pecially &s;alt or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> provi&s;ions, becau&s;e they are hard of dige&s;tion, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> bad nouri&s;hment. Their diet &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of light animal food, taken in a &s;mall quantity at a time, but often. At all times of life, but e&s;pecially in old age, the con&s;tant u&s;e of &s;alt and &s;moaked meats tends to harden and &s;tiffen the &s;olid parts of the body, in&s;tead of afford|ing good nouri&s;hment; being hard of dige&s;tion: in old age the fluids are more thick, &s;ecretious, more &s;low, and the &s;olids harder than in youth; therefore they require a more &s;oft, moi&s;tning diet, ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, and not too much at a time, e&s;pecially of a night.</P>
<P>All great changes ought to be brought about in&s;en&s;ibly, for cu&s;tom is a &s;econd nature, and an acquired habit is hard to be left off. Many per&s;ons enjoy a good &s;tate of health when their meat and drink are very indifferent, by being accu&s;tomed thereto; and are apt to be &s;ick, when they attempt to change their manner of life. Cu&s;tom confines us to certain hours, but hunger points out the be&s;t time of eating. In age, where &s;trength is wanting, and in youth, wherein there is a great di&s;&s;ipation, when much is not eaten at a time, &s;omething taken between the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> is not improper. It is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that when the &s;tomach is bad, per&s;ons &s;hould not begin to eat again, till the la&s;t meal is dige&s;ted.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who are much fatigued &s;hould re&s;t before eating; and, in ca&s;es of di&s;tre&s;s and &s;orrow, the food &s;hould be now light, and &s;mall in quantity, becau&s;e the &s;tomach is weak at tho&s;e times.</P>

mixing it with the &s;pittle; for this rea&s;on light foods are mo&s;t proper for children, and old per&s;ons who have lo&s;t their teeth.</P>
<P>Vegetables are more difficult of dige&s;tion than animal food, therefore improper for weak &s;tomachs. On this ac|count, light food, &s;uch as veal, lamb, chicken, fi&s;h, are the food which be&s;t agree with delicate con&s;titutions. On the contrary, &s;tronger habits are mo&s;t &s;ubject to be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> with tender and young meats, than with beef, and mutton; becau&s;e the degree of heat which convert beef and mutton into the true &s;tate it ought to have in the &s;tomach, carry the tender aliment of lamb, pig, chickens, &amp;c. into a &s;tercorous or excremental &s;tate, before it leaves the &s;tomach; whence fluxes, &amp;c. In &s;uch &s;trong &s;tomachs, it is nece&s;&s;ary to mix vegetables with the animal food, that the fermentation of the one may oppo&s;e the too pre|cipitate dige&s;tion of the other by its acidity. Hence it is obvious, that weak &s;tomachs &s;hould ab&s;tain from vegeta|bles, which require a greater degree of vital heat than even beef or mutton, to be converted into proper nouri&s;h|ment. This, I hope, will &s;atisfactorily explain the terms of ea&s;y and difficult dige&s;tion. The &s;tomach, which can bear beef and water, cannot bear roa&s;ted pig and water, from too great a power of dige&s;tion, not from any defici|ency in tho&s;e faculties; therefore beef and mutton are more ea&s;y of dige&s;tion than lamb, or any of the white meats; and the contrary in weak &s;tomachs. Surfeits, from lob&s;ters, crabs, &amp;c. are of the kind which ri&s;e from a too &s;udden change of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances in the &s;tomach; therefore they &s;hould be always eaten with vinegar or lemon juice. In fact, butter is no bad pre&s;ervative again&s;t &s;urfeits in this in&s;tance; the oil blending with the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;alts, forms a &s;oap of that which would otherwi&s;e be a more acrimonious, inflammatory, and offen&s;ive &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Sleep re&s;tores the &s;trength, and repairs and replaces the wa&s;tes which are made by the labour and exerci&s;e of the day.

<P>The pa&s;&s;ions and affections of the mind, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> joy, fear, anger, &amp;c. produce very &s;en&s;ible effects, and when too much given way to, have a very bad effect on health, for they affect the &s;tomach, hinder dige&s;tion, and chylification; whence ari&s;e many terrible di&s;orders: wherefore it is be&s;t to keep them in bounds as much as po&s;&s;ible, and to pre|&s;erve an inward &s;erenity, calmne&s;s, and tranquility.</P>
<P>Exce&s;&s;ive venery mu&s;t be avoided, &s;ince the action of coition is very impetuous, and comes near to a convul&s;ion. The animal heat is greatly le&s;&s;ened thereby, the habit of body weakened wonderfully, and the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem largely injured.</P>

<HEAD>RULES for nur&s;ing SICK PERSONS.</HEAD>
<P>It is a great mi&s;take, to &s;uppo&s;e that all di&s;tempers are cured by &s;weating; and that, to procure &s;weat, &s;ick per|&s;ons
<PB N="48" REF="010783_0063_0F86F10C58506D20">
mu&s;t take hot medicines, and keep them&s;elves very hot; for &s;weating carries off the thinner part of the blood, leaving the remainder more dry, thick and inflamed, which mu&s;t evidently increa&s;e the di&s;order; for, in&s;tead of forcing out the watery part of the blood, we &s;hould rather endeavour to increa&s;e it, by drinking freely of barley-wa|ter, balm tea, lemonade, or any other diluting liquor made luke warm. What has been already &s;aid on the head of &s;oul confined air, &s;hews the ab&s;urdity of &s;tifling the &s;ick per&s;on with the heat of a clo&s;e apartment, and a load of bed-cloaths; for the&s;e two cau&s;es are &s;ufficient alone to pro|duce a fever, even in an healthy per&s;on. By letting in a little fre&s;h air now and then into a &s;ick per&s;on's room, and le&s;&s;ening the bed-cloaths, you will almo&s;t always perceive the fever and oppre&s;&s;ion in &s;ome mea&s;ure abate. In&s;tead of venice treacle, &s;affron, ga&s;coign powder, and other heating medicines, in all feveri&s;h di&s;orders, the belly &s;hould be kept moderately open; whil&s;t tho&s;e medicines ju&s;t mentioned render the body co&s;tive, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have a bad effect.</P>
<P>Fevers are aggravated by giving the &s;ick per&s;ons food through fear of their dying of weakne&s;s; which food in|crea&s;es the di&s;order, and renders it fatal. This fear is groundle&s;s; per&s;ons in a fever may be &s;upported, even for &s;ome weeks, with liquids only; and are &s;tronger at the expiration of that time than if they had taken more &s;olid nouri&s;hment; for, from the fir&s;t attack of a fever, what|ever &s;olid food is taken, even &s;oup, eggs, bi&s;cuit, &amp;c. corrupts in the &s;tomach. If a man in perfect health was to eat &s;tinking meat, rotten eggs, four broths, &amp;c. he would be &s;eized with vomiting, load at the &s;tomach, a purging, fever, and eruptions of the &s;kin.</P>
<P>The &s;ame articles, even in the &s;ounde&s;t &s;tate, given to a per&s;on in a fever, are quickly putrified, by the heat and di&s;ea&s;ed matter already in his &s;tomach, and in a few hours produce the &s;ame effects. Is it then po&s;&s;ible to expect the lea&s;t &s;ervice from them? No: as long as a &s;ick per&s;on has a bad humour in his &s;tomach, his weakne&s;s increa&s;es, in proportion to the food he receives; for this food being corrupted by the infected matter already there, proves in|capable of affording the lea&s;t nouri&s;hment; on the contrary, becomes an additional cau&s;e of the di&s;temper. Be&s;ides, to heat and cram the &s;ick per&s;on, is wholly oppo&s;ite to what
<PB N="49" REF="010783_0064_0F86F10DA18DFF10">
nature her&s;elf indicates: the burning heat of which they complain, the dryne&s;s of the lips, tongue, and throat, the high colour of their urine, their earne&s;t longing after cooling things, the plea&s;ure and benefit they receive from the admi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h air into their chamber, are &s;o many proofs that we ought to cool them moderately, by refre&s;h|ing and diluting liquors, &s;uch as balm tea, lemonade, &amp;c. to promote an ea&s;y di&s;charge of the vitiated humours. Tho&s;e who have the care of &s;ick per&s;ons, &s;hould particu|larly attend to this ob&s;ervation, that as long as there is any ta&s;te of bitterne&s;s, &s;ickne&s;s, or de&s;ire of reaching; bad breath, heat, and feveri&s;hne&s;s, with offen&s;ive &s;tools, and high-coloured urine made in a &s;mall quantity only; &s;o long all fle&s;h meats, &s;oups, eggs, and all kind of food compo&s;ed of any of them, and all heating medicines, wine, &amp;c. are &s;o many ab&s;olute poi&s;ons.</P>
<P>If the &s;ick per&s;on has not two motions for &s;tool in the twenty four hours; if the urine is high coloured, the fever runs high, the pain of the head and loins con&s;iderable, a gly&s;ter of warm water with &s;weet oil, and a little common &s;alt, &s;hould be given once in a day. As long as the patient has &s;trength for it, he &s;hould fit up out of bed an hour daily, and longer if he can bear it; but he &s;hould not be rai&s;ed whil&s;t in a &s;weat. His linen &s;hould be changed every other day, taking care that the clean linen is well aired; for nothing conduces more to continue the fever and light|headedne&s;s, than confining the &s;ick con&s;tantly to their bed, and preventing their changing their foul linen.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons recovering from di&s;tempers, require great care and attention; in proportion to the abatement and decline of the fever, their quantity of food may be gradually in|crea&s;ed; and when the fever is entirely gone, the &s;ick per&s;on may venture on a little white meat, &s;uch as chicken, rabbit, whitings, flounders, or other flat fi&s;h; but &s;almon, eels, carp, &s;kait, haddock, and the like, are not to be ventured on 'till the recovery is ab&s;olutely perfected: Soups, new-laid eggs, and a little wine diluted with water; but the&s;e are to be u&s;ed with great moderation, becau&s;e the &s;tomach, being extremely weakened by the di&s;ea&s;e, is ca|pable only as yet of a &s;mall degree of dige&s;tion; and if the quantity of nouri&s;hment exceeds its power ever &s;o little, it will not dige&s;t, but become putrid, and delay the recovery.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="010783_0065_0F86F10F4BA7BBF0">
To procure a compleat and perfect termination of acute di&s;ea&s;es, ob&s;erve the following rules:</P>
<P>Let per&s;ons recovering, as well as tho&s;e who are &s;ick, take very little food at a time, and take it often.</P>
<P>Let their meal con&s;i&s;t of one kind of food only, and let them chew their food well.</P>
<P>Le&s;&s;en their quantity of drink; the be&s;t in general is wine and water; three parts water, to one part wine; for too great a quantity of liquids prevent the &s;tomach from recovering its tone, and increa&s;es the tendency to a &s;well|ing of the legs.</P>
<P>Riding on hor&s;eback, as often as they are able, is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary: the propere&s;t time for this exerci&s;e is in the forenoon.</P>
<P>They &s;hould eat nothing, or at mo&s;t but very little, in the evening, as per&s;ons in this &s;tate are &s;eldom quite &s;o well towards night. Their &s;leep will be the le&s;s di&s;turb|ed for this caution: &s;even or eight hours, at mo&s;t, are as much as &s;hould be allotted for lying in bed.</P>
<P>A &s;tool is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary every day; but if the co&s;tivene&s;s exceeds the &s;econd day, a gly&s;ter &s;hould be ad|mini&s;tered; or &s;ooner, if the per&s;on feels unea&s;y, is re&s;t|le&s;s, or has the head-ach.</P>
<P>If after &s;ome time they &s;till continue very weak, and their &s;tomach is di&s;ordered, and they have, from time to time, a little irregular fever, they &s;hould take a tea-cup full of the decoction of the Peruvian bark, three or four times in a day, which may be prepared by boiling an ounce of the be&s;t bark in powder, in a quart of water, 'till two thirds are wa&s;ted away, and then adding to the remainder a gill of red wine.</P>
<P>Labouring men mu&s;t by no means return to work too &s;oon after their recovery, left it prevent their ever getting perfectly well, and entirely recovering their lo&s;t &s;trength.</P>

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS concerning BLEEDING.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH bleeding has been directed in many di&s;or|ders in the cour&s;e of this work; yet, as the improper u&s;e of it is attended frequently with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equen|ces, it has been judged nece&s;&s;ary to bring into one point of view all tho&s;e ca&s;es in which bleeding may be admini|&s;tered
<PB N="51" REF="010783_0066_0F86F10FD8692158">
with advantage, as well as tho&s;e in which it is highly prejudicial. In all inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, it &s;hould by no means be omitted, as in the pleuri&s;y, and peripneumony, during the fir&s;t days; but &s;o &s;oon as the &s;ymptoms of &s;up|puration appear, expectorating medicines are the mo&s;t pro|per means from which to expect relief, and the u&s;e of the lancet mu&s;t be totally forbid. In the apoplexy, epilep&s;y, bloody-flux and inflammation of the bowels, bleeding mu&s;t be repeated according to the exigence of the &s;ymp|toms: it is al&s;o u&s;eful, &s;ometimes to promote &s;uppuration in large abce&s;&s;es, where nature is too much oppre&s;t by the violence of the inflammation. In inflammations of the eyes, bladder, or womb, i&s;chiatic pains, rheumati&s;ms, coughs, pleuri&s;y, head-achs, quin&s;eys, a&s;thmas, hemorr|hages, and nephritic complaints, bleeding is of the ut|mo&s;t &s;ervice; but in every di&s;order proceeding from a relaxed &s;tate of the &s;olid parts, and impoveri&s;hed &s;tate of the blood, attended with a cachectic habit of body, &s;uch as drop&s;ies, jaundice, gout, &amp;c. bleeding mu&s;t be ab|&s;tained from with the utmo&s;t caution, as it will, in&s;tead of relieving, greatly aggravate tho&s;e di&s;tempers.</P>
