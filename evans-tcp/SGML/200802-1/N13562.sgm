</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THOUGH GOD, (for wi&s;e rea&s;ons, be&s;t known to him&s;elf) has permitted &s;in to enter into the world; yet, we may be &s;ure, he will not &s;uffer the purpo&s;es of his goodne&s;s to be fru&s;trated by it; but will, in &s;ome way or other, over-rule this wor&s;t of evils, for good; and make &s;inners them&s;elves, (contrary to their de&s;ign and intention) the in&s;truments of promo|ting the great ends of his moral government, and the occa&s;ional cau&s;es of benefit to others, at the &s;ame time, that they expo&s;e them&s;elves to mi&s;ery and ruin, which will inevitably come upon them, either in this world or in that to come, or in both, as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for their wickedne&s;s, unle&s;s prevented by repentance.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="017130_0004_0FA03189A5CF3300">IT cannot be doubted, but the infinitely wi&s;e GOD knows how to promote his own glory, by tho&s;e ungoverned lu&s;ts of envious, di&s;contented and proud mortals, which are a prolific &s;ource of continual mi&s;chief and mi&s;ery, both to particular per&s;ons and &s;ocieties, and whereby thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands are involved in great troubles and grievous di&s;tre&s;&s;es, all the days of their lives. And as GOD knows how to promote his own glo|ry, by the lu&s;ts of men, &s;o we have rea&s;on to be|lieve that he will do it, (as he has done it already in innumerable obvious in&s;tances, from the be|ginning of the world) either by laying re&s;traints upon tho&s;e lu&s;ts, or over-ruling their operations in &s;uch a manner, as to make them contribute (in direct contrariety to their natural aim) to the execution of his own gracious purpo&s;es; or by taking occa&s;ion from them, to exhibit &s;uch re|markable di&s;plays of his power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, as &s;hall be admirably adapted to beget and cheri&s;h adoring thoughts of his being, perfec|tions, and providence, and to produce all tho&s;e ex|ternal honorary acts of wor&s;hip and homage, which he requires of us.</P>
<P>WE live in an angry and provoking world. Ever &s;ince the fatal apo&s;tacy of our fir&s;t parents, <HI>the wrath of man</HI> has been at work to &s;pread mi|&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s over the face of the earth. <HI>Hateful and hating one another,</HI> is too much the character of by far the greater part of the human race. It &s;eems indeed, that it mu&s;t be evident to every one, that the happine&s;s of &s;ocial life depends
<PB N="7" REF="017130_0005_0FA0318A6B06C540">
e&s;&s;entially upon the exerci&s;e of mutual benevolence and the con&s;tant reciprocal interchange of kind and friendly offices; but yet, as if men were en|tirely ignorant of the va&s;t advantages of love and harmony, peace and friend&s;hip, it may, with truth, be affirmed of the generality, that they
<Q><L>"Live in hatred, enmity and &s;trife</L>
<L>"Among them&s;elves, and levy cruel wars,</L>
<L>"Wa&s;ting the earth, each other to de&s;troy."</L></Q></P>
<P>THROUGH the prevalence of pride, envy, am|bition, avarice, and other corrupt lu&s;ts, the earth is full of the habitations of violence, cruelty and war. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are the grand &s;ource of mu|tual jealou&s;ies, animo&s;ities, enmities, reproaches, in&s;ults and injuries; they lead directly to a viola|tion of every moral obligation, and of every prin|ciple of &s;ocial virtue; their natural fruits are in|ju&s;tice, unrighteou&s;ne&s;s &amp; oppre&s;&s;ion, from whence come &s;trife and contention, di&s;cord, tumult and di&s;order; and when they are inflamed with wrath and armed with power, they generally drive mat|ters to extremity, pu&s;hing men into &s;uch arbitrary and cruel actions and pur&s;uits, as enkindle the flames of war, which it often requires a va&s;t effu|&s;ion of human blood to extingui&s;h.</P>
<P>BUT when we &s;ee or feel the &s;ad effects of the di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions and baneful di&s;tempers of hu|man nature, our comfort is, that <HI>the Lord God om|nipotent reigneth,</HI> who can and will an&s;wer his own mo&s;t wi&s;e purpo&s;es thereby, or &s;et bounds thereto, as to his infinite wi&s;dom &s;hall &s;eem be&s;t.
<PB N="8" REF="017130_0006_0FA0318B2A5CFC68">
This comfortable doctrine is clearly contained in the text. We may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that the &s;upreme governor of the world, will not &s;uffer <HI>the wrath of man,</HI> of a weak and impotent mortal, (how much &s;oever advanced above his fellow mortals) to overthrow his government, or defeat the coun|&s;els of his wi&s;dom; but will cau&s;e it to <HI>prai&s;e him</HI>; that is, (as was ju&s;t now &s;ugge&s;ted) he will either &s;o check and re&s;train it, or &s;o manage and over-rule the operations of it, as to make it &s;ub|&s;ervient to the ends and de&s;igns of his providence, and the occa&s;ional cau&s;e of &s;uch events, as &s;hall &s;hew forth his perfections, and induce every atten|tive and pious ob&s;erver, to prai&s;e and glorify him.</P>
<P>I DOUBT not, my hearers, but you can recol|lect in&s;tances that have fallen under your own ob|&s;ervation, wherein the lu&s;ts of particular per&s;ons have been either remarkably re&s;trained, or remar|kably over-ruled, as occa&s;ions of good, where evil was de&s;igned and intended. Every in&s;tance of this kind, that comes within our view, &s;hould lead us to admire and adore the wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s of God, who di&s;appointeth the evil de&s;igns of &s;inners, and cau&s;eth even the operation of their lu&s;ts to be productive of events, in favour of tho&s;e, whom they meant to injure.</P>
<P>SACRED hi&s;tory furni&s;hes us with many in|&s;tances, to this purpo&s;e. I will mention a few of them, which will &s;erve, at once, to illu&s;trate the meaning of the text, and to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome thoughts and reflections, &s;uitable to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="017130_0007_0FA0318BE6EE4F00">THE &s;tory of Jo&s;eph, in the book of Gene&s;is, affords one in&s;tance, to this purpo&s;e. In&s;tigated by pride, envy, anger and unrea&s;onable re&s;ent|ment, his brethren &s;old him into Egypt. They had nothing in view, in this ba&s;e and unnatural action, but the gratification of their own unruly pa&s;&s;ions and corrupt lu&s;ts; but the wi&s;dom of GOD over-ruled it for good, contrary to their ex|pectation and de&s;ign. They <HI>thought evil</HI> again&s;t their innocent brother, when they &s;old him for a &s;lave; but this heinou&s;ly wicked action of theirs, was the occa&s;ion of his promotion to high honor and authority in the Egyptian court, whereby he was enabled to <HI>&s;ave his father's hou&s;e,</HI> and <HI>much people alive</HI> in a time of famine.</P>
<P>ANOTHER pertinent in&s;tance, we may find in the hi&s;tory of Pharaoh, in the beginning of the book of Exodus. The wrath and madne&s;s of Pharaoh, and the cruelties which his haughty and &s;avage temper prompted him to exerci&s;e upon the children of I&s;rael, in order to check their growth, and &s;ecure them in a &s;tate of dependance and ba&s;e &s;ervitude, prepared the way, under the govern|ment of Providence, for their remarkable deliver|ance; and afforded occa&s;ions for a &s;eries of &s;uch wonderful di&s;plays of the power of GOD, as could not but excite all pious ob&s;ervers, to pay him their devout honors and adorations. And the de&s;truction, which Pharaoh's pride and ob&s;tinacy plunged him into, was no le&s;s remarkable, than was the deliverance of I&s;rael. From whence it is natural to ob&s;erve, that proud a&s;piring mortals
<PB N="10" REF="017130_0008_0FA0318CAC627128">
are often <HI>en&s;nared in the work of their own hands,</HI> and defeated by the very mea&s;ures which they take to carry their iniquitous &s;chemes into execu|tion. <HI>There are many devices in a man's heart,</HI> &s;ays the wi&s;e man, <HI>but the coun&s;el of the Lord, that &s;hall &s;tand.</HI></P>
<P>THE great men, the princes and potentates of the earth, who are entru&s;ted with the manage|ment of the affairs of &s;tates and kingdoms, are as much &s;ubject to the controul of an higher power, as any of the lower ranks and cla&s;&s;es of people. They are all at the di&s;po&s;al of the &s;upreme Go|vernor of the world, who&s;e providence, as it is concerned in all occurrences and events, and in all the vici&s;&s;itudes of human affairs, &s;o does more e&s;pecially interpo&s;e in the ri&s;e and fall of empires, and in all the great revolutions that take place among the nations of the earth. In ways and by means unthought of and unfore&s;een, the profound|e&s;t policies and mo&s;t promi&s;ing &s;chemes of re&s;tle&s;s ambition, are often di&s;concerted, and the mea|&s;ures adopted by it, made to terminate in its own confu&s;ion. When this is the ca&s;e, we have al|ways rea&s;on to adore the providence of that Al|mighty Being, who pre&s;ides over the world, and is the di&s;po&s;er of all events.</P>
<P>THOSE men, who are actuated by a lu&s;t of power and domination, &s;eem, &s;ometimes, to be judicially left of GOD, to u&s;e &s;uch methods, for the promotion of their ambitious &s;chemes, as have a direct tendency to defeat their enterprizes, and
<PB N="11" REF="017130_0009_0FA0318DAFE809C0">
to pre&s;erve to others tho&s;e important rights and li|berties, of which they endeavour to rob them, for the &s;ake of aggrandizing them&s;elves. The conduct of <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> after the death of his fa|ther <HI>Solomon</HI> (as it is recorded in the twelfth chap|ter of the fir&s;t book of Kings) affords a very &s;tri|king example of this kind. As &s;oon as <HI>Rehobo|am</HI> came to the throne of his father, the people applied to him, with their petitions, for a redre&s;s of grievances: But Rehoboam, de&s;pi&s;ing the moderate coun&s;els of the aged and wi&s;e, and fol|lowing the imprudent advice of young and un|&s;kilful courtiers, as being more agreeable to his own a&s;piring and ambitious views, <HI>an&s;wered</HI> the people <HI>roughly,</HI> and rejected their petitions with in&s;ult. In con&s;equence of &s;uch ill-treatment, ten tribes revolted, and &s;et up another king over them: Of this revolt and revolution, Rehoboham him&s;elf was the immediate occa&s;ional or procu|ring cau&s;e. His pride and haughtine&s;s, alienated from him the hearts of the greate&s;t part of his &s;ubjects, and divided his father's dominion into two kingdoms. But it is very ob&s;ervable, that it is expre&s;&s;ly &s;aid, <HI>The cau&s;e was from the Lord</HI>; and this is a&s;&s;igned as the rea&s;on why Rehoboam, adhering to the imprudent coun&s;els of raw and ra&s;h politicians, rejected, with affrontive in&s;olence, the rea&s;onable petitions of the people. This revolu|tion being agreeable to the will of GOD, Rehobo|am was left to his own folly, which kept the things of his peace out of &s;ight, and influenced him to take a &s;tep, which provoked the mo&s;t of the tribes to throw off their allegiance, and reject him from
<PB N="12" REF="017130_0010_0FA0318F0B2D7B10">
being king over them. Thus GOD often <HI>taketh the wi&s;e in their own craftine&s;s</HI>; cau&s;ing the mea|&s;ures which they principally depend upon, for ac|compli&s;hing their ambitious de&s;igns, to produce events directly contrary to their views and expec|tations.</P>
<P>BY their wrath, by their vindictive re&s;entments, the haughty and ambitious, are &s;ometimes preci|pitated into actions, for the gratification of their pride and revenge, which not only i&s;&s;ue in their own ruin, but in the advancement of tho&s;e whom they meant to de&s;troy. Haman (of whom we have a particular account in the book of E&s;ther) is an in&s;tance, in proof of this. In the fiercene&s;s of his wrath (the occa&s;ion of which, it may be pre&s;umed you are not ignorant of) Haman plotted the de|&s;truction of Mordecai, and all the Jews in the king|dom of Aha&s;uerus; and had the addre&s;s to obtain a decree from the king, for that purpo&s;e. But this infernal plot terminated in his own utter ruin, and led the way to Mordecai's promotion, affording, at the &s;ame time, an occa&s;ion for a &s;ignal di&s;play of the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of Providence, in the deliverance of the Jews from the de&s;truction that was ju&s;t ready to fall upon them. This in&s;tance, with that of Pharaoh before mentioned, will &s;uf|ficiently ju&s;tify the following ob&s;ervation, viz. that,</P>
<P>GREAT and important revolutions, in favour of the cau&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s and liberty, are &s;ome|times brought about, by means of the cruel and vindictive mea&s;ures, which powerful oppre&s;&s;ors
<PB N="13" REF="017130_0011_0FA03190995B9B90">
take, to promote their ambitious views, and to keep others in awe and &s;ervile dependence. Wrath and cruelty are generally ra&s;h and precipitate, and calculated to rai&s;e a &s;pirit of indignation and de&s;|perate oppo&s;ition, in tho&s;e who feel the &s;ad effects of them. The haughty tyrant, who endeavours to advance his oppre&s;&s;ive &s;chemes, and to &s;et him|&s;elf up above all law and ju&s;tice, by &s;everities and cruelties, dictated by wrath, does thereby fre|quently work out his own di&s;appointment, and is forced eventually to acknowledge his impo|tence, and to own a power above him&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT when the power of oppre&s;&s;ors is &s;o great, as to bear down all oppo&s;ition, and compel peo|ple to a &s;ervile &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, it is to be con&s;idered as a ju&s;t judgment of GOD, who &s;ometimes cau&s;es <HI>the wrath of man to prai&s;e him,</HI> by employing it to puni&s;h a people for their &s;ins. And herein we may ob&s;erve the un&s;earchable wi&s;dom of GOD, who, while man (unnece&s;&s;itated by any foreign impul&s;e) is impiou&s;ly and wickedly gratifying his lu&s;ts, makes tho&s;e very lu&s;ts &s;ub&s;ervient to his providence, for the puni&s;hment of others. This is admirably &s;et forth in the conduct of the A&s;|&s;yrian monarch (as the &s;ame is recorded in the tenth chapter of the prophecy of I&s;aiah.) GOD was plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of this haughty tyrant, as a rod, for the correction and cha&s;ti&s;ement of his people; wi&s;ely managing the di&s;tempers of his proud and ambitious mind, for the puni&s;h|ment of the Jews, for their &s;inful defections from him. But as the A&s;&s;yrian acted freely, being
<PB N="14" REF="017130_0012_0FA03191489B52C8">
under no con&s;traint, it was no excu&s;e for him, that GOD made his pride and ambition, in&s;tru|mental in bringing his righteous judgments on the Jewi&s;h nation; but his conduct was highly affrontive to Heaven, and expo&s;ed him to the righteous re&s;entments of the Supreme Governor. <HI>Wherefore,</HI> &s;ays GOD, <HI>when I have performed my whole will on Zion and Jeru&s;alem, I will puni&s;h the fruit of the &s;tout heart of the king of A&s;&s;yria, and the glory of his high looks.</HI></P>
<P>IN the in&s;tances that have been mentioned above, we &s;ee, that &s;o far as GOD permits the <HI>wrath of man</HI> to exert it&s;elf, he will over-rule the operations of it, for advancing the important pur|po&s;es of his government; and we are fully a&s;&s;u|red that he will, in no ca&s;es, &s;uffer it to break out farther, than &s;hall redound to his prai&s;e and honor. <HI>The remainder of wrath he will re&s;train</HI>; that is, he will &s;et bounds to it, and render it un|able to accompli&s;h what it aims at. Thus (as we are informed in the 37th chapter of the pro|phecy of I&s;aiah) he re&s;trained Sennacherib's wrath, and forced him to quit his enterprize again&s;t Jeru&s;alem. Sennacherib carried his boa&s;ts and menaces to &s;uch an height, as implied a defi|ance of the great Lord of heaven and earth; but the GOD whom he defied interpo&s;ed, and pre|vented his attempting what he de&s;igned, by the miraculous de&s;truction of one hundred and eigh|ty-five thou&s;and of his army in one night; thus <HI>putting an hook in his no&s;e, and a bridle in his jaws,</HI> and obliging him to <HI>return</HI> home <HI>a&s;hamed.</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="017130_0013_0FA03194E4EA0320">
Such miraculous interpo&s;itions of providence for <HI>re&s;training the wrath of man,</HI> cannot indeed be rationally expected, in common ca&s;es; but GOD can do this as effectually, without a miracle, as with, as will appear from what will pre&s;ently be offered.</P>
<P>SHOULD GOD permit the wrath of man to do all that it de&s;igns, what havock and deva&s;tation, what mi&s;chief and wretchedne&s;s, would it &s;pread through the world? This world, at be&s;t, is a ve|ry turbulent &s;cene; but it would be much more &s;o, did not providence lay re&s;traints upon the lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of ill-de&s;igning men, and prevent their going to &s;uch lengths in mi&s;chief, as they wi&s;h. It is happy for the world, that man's pow|er is not equal to his wrath; and that tho&s;e, who, in&s;tigated by an evil temper, form mi&s;chievous projects, are often hindered from executing them; at lea&s;t, to that extent, which they de&s;ire.</P>
<P>THERE are many ways, wherein GOD checks and re&s;trains <HI>the wrath of man,</HI> and defeats its pernicious devices, when, and &s;o far as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES he does this by rai&s;ing a &s;pirit of fear, whereby men are di&s;couraged from under|taking or pro&s;ecuting tho&s;e mi&s;chievous enterpri|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">es, which their wrath and corrupt lu&s;ts would otherwi&s;e prompt them to undertake and pur&s;ue. As GOD has the <HI>hearts of all men in his hands, and turneth them whither&s;oever he will, as the ri|vers of water,</HI> &s;o there is rea&s;on to believe that,
<PB N="16" REF="017130_0014_0FA0319642DB79D0">
by &s;ecret influences, he does &s;ometimes rai&s;e and &s;ometimes depre&s;s the natural &s;pirits of men, for the promotion of his purpo&s;es of judgment or of mercy. Every one who is acquainted with, and firmly believes the divine philo&s;ophy of the &s;crip|tures, mu&s;t be clear in this, that GOD can, and frequently does, by immediate impre&s;&s;ions on the mind, &s;o effectually di&s;hearten and intimidate tho&s;e, who&s;e vindictive pa&s;&s;ions would lead them into all manner of mi&s;chief and cruelty, as either to confine the operations of their wrath to them|&s;elves, or to render it weak and impotent, faint and irre&s;olute, in its attempts again&s;t others. The ty|rants of the earth are, no doubt, often thus re|&s;trained&punc; <HI>Faintne&s;s</HI> is <HI>&s;ent into their hearts,</HI> and fear takes hold on them, which &s;erves as a barrier again&s;t that torrent of wrath, which would other|wi&s;e &s;pread de&s;truction and de&s;olation all around them. Again,</P>
<P>SOMETIMES GOD <HI>re&s;trains men's wrath</HI> by interpo&s;ing unthought-of accidents, ob&s;tacles and difficulties, which entirely di&s;concert their mea|&s;ures and overthrow their mi&s;chievous &s;chemes and devices. <HI>The race is not to the &s;wift,</HI> &s;ays the royal preacher, <HI>nor the battle to the &s;trong, neither yet bread to the wi&s;e, nor yet riches to men of under&s;tanding, nor yet favour to men of &s;kill; but time and chance happeneth to them all:</HI> by which he doubtle&s;s means to teach us,
<Q>that there is a &s;ecret providence concerned in all human affairs, which &s;ometimes pre&s;ents men with unexpected opportunities, or interpo&s;eth
<PB N="17" REF="017130_0015_0FA03196676305E8">
accidents, which no human wi&s;dom could fore&s;ee; which &s;ometimes produceth events contrary to human probabilities, giving &s;ucce&s;s to very unlikely means, and defeating the &s;wift, the &s;trong, the learned, the indu&s;trious, and tho&s;e that are be&s;t ver&s;ed in men and bu&s;ine&s;s, of their &s;everal ends, and de&s;igns.</Q>
All na|ture is at the beck of the great Creator, who, when he plea&s;es, can employ any part thereof, to <HI>di&s;appoint the devices of the crafty, and carry the coun&s;els of the froward headlong.</HI> What we call &s;econd cau&s;es, are entirely dependent upon the great fir&s;t cau&s;e, to whom they owe all their force and energy; and who can, and, no doubt, often does (either immediately by him&s;elf, or mediately by &s;ubordinate agents) occa&s;ionally &s;u&s;|&s;pend, retard or quicken their influence, to fru&s;|trate the mo&s;t promi&s;ing &s;chemes of men, and thereby to humble their pride, to teach them their dependence, and to promote his own mo&s;t wi&s;e purpo&s;es. Secret and hidden cau&s;es he of|ten &s;ets to work, whereby unfore&s;een and unex|pected events are produced, which overthrow the &s;chemes of human pride, ambition and revenge. By &s;torms and pe&s;tilences, by di&s;a&s;ters and mi&s;|fortunes, which no human &s;kill could fore&s;ee, or power obviate, he frequently cohibits the wrath of the mightie&s;t potentates, and cru&s;hes the mi&s;|chievous machinations of his people's enemies in|to abortion.</P>
<P>FURTHER, GOD &s;ometimes checks and <HI>re|&s;trains the wrath of men,</HI> by leaving them to ju|dicial

infatuation, whereby they are led to adopt coun&s;els and mea&s;ures, tending, in the natural cour&s;e of things, to defeat their de&s;igns, and over|throw their enterprizes. When men are pu&s;hing forward their iniquitous &s;chemes with the great|e&s;t zeal and vehemence, and have the mo&s;t flat|tering pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s, they are &s;ometimes, by an unaccountable imprudence, led to reject the coun&s;els mo&s;t favourable to their de&s;igns, and to embrace tho&s;e that lead directly to di&s;appoint|ment. The &s;tory of Ab&s;olom, in the &s;econd book of Samuel (not to mention again the ca&s;e of Rehoboam) furni&s;hes an in&s;tance of this kind. Ab&s;olom rai&s;ed a rebellion again&s;t his father Da|vid; but in pro&s;ecuting his ambitious views, he was remarkably influenced to adopt mea&s;ures, calculated to defeat and di&s;appoint him. The &s;age advice of Ahithophel, a judicious and &s;kilful coun&s;ellor, though mo&s;t favourable to his de|&s;igns, was <HI>turned into fooli&s;hne&s;s</HI> in his &s;ight, and he was left to comply with coun&s;els of a differ|ent nature, which i&s;&s;ued in the ruin both of his wicked projects, and him&s;elf. This was <HI>the Lord's doing.</HI> And thus GOD &s;ometimes judici|ally <HI>hides wi&s;dom from the wi&s;e,</HI> and leaves them to pur&s;ue &s;uch imprudent methods, as directly tend to di&s;appoint their hopes, and fru&s;trate their mo&s;t promi&s;ing &s;chemes.</P>
<P>ONCE more, another way wherein GOD <HI>re|&s;trains the wrath of man,</HI> is, by rou&s;ing tho&s;e who &s;uffer, or are likely to &s;uffer by it, to &s;tand in their own defence; and in&s;piring them with

courage and re&s;olution, to oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t, to the utmo&s;t, all the mi&s;chievous efforts of the am|bition, wrath and anger of tho&s;e proud a&s;piring mortals, who would, if po&s;&s;ible, rob them of their natural rights, and plunge them into a &s;tate of &s;ervility. And this is the mo&s;t u&s;ual method of Providence, for re&s;training and curbing the di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions and corrupt lu&s;ts of ambitious and revengeful men. Sometimes indeed GOD is plea&s;ed to interpo&s;e in an extraordinary way, for the deliverance of his people from the rage and wrath of their enemies; to take their controver&s;y, as it were, into his own hands; and to work &s;al|vation for them, by means, in which their own agency is not at all concerned: but mo&s;t com|monly, it is by the right u&s;e, of tho&s;e means of pre&s;ervation and &s;afety, which he has put into their power, that he defends &amp; &s;aves them. There is nothing more irrational than to neglect &s;uch means, and depend upon miraculous protections. When GOD purpo&s;es to re&s;train the wrath of his people's enemies, he u&s;ually rou&s;es a &s;pirit of op|po&s;ition, &s;tirs them up to make a re&s;olute re&s;i&s;t|ance, and animates and excites them to the mo&s;t vigorous efforts for the maintenance of their rights. And whenever a people are enabled to baffle and di&s;appoint their enemies, and defeat their attempts to gratify their ambition or revenge, they ought to a&s;cribe the glory to GOD, who&s;e interpo&s;ing providence has pro&s;pered their endea|vours, and crowned their enterprizes with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P>IN the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the pre&s;ent war, we have &s;een both parts of our text verified, in in|numerable in&s;tances. <HI>The wrath of man</HI> has been made to <HI>prai&s;e GOD,</HI> by producing events con|trary to tho&s;e, which it aimed at. <HI>The wrath of</HI> man has al&s;o been re&s;trained, defeated and con|founded, and after all its vaunting boa&s;ts, been obliged to own its impotence and weakne&s;s.

<P>THE pride, avarice and ambition of Great-Britain, gave ri&s;e to the pre&s;ent ho&s;tile conte&s;ts. From this &s;ource originated tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive acts, which fir&s;t alarmed the freemen of America; and provoked them, after petitioning in vain for redre&s;s, to form plans of oppo&s;ition and re&s;i&s;tance. This conduct of America exa&s;perated the Briti&s;h admini&s;tration, and rou&s;ed all their wrath Tran&s;|ported with angry re&s;entments, they proceeded

from oppre&s;&s;ion to open war, in order to frighten and compel us into a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e arbitrary and de&s;potic &s;chemes, which they were determi|ned, at all hazards, to carry into execution. But tho&s;e vindictive and &s;anguinary coun&s;els and mea|&s;ures, which, in the vehemence of their pa&s;&s;ions, they adopted, for this purpo&s;e, have, by the pro|vidence of GOD, contrary to their expectations, involved them in the mo&s;t perplexing difficul|ties, by uniting thirteen provinces of America, in that declaration of independence, which they now wi&s;h us to re&s;cind.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE it will be obvious to every one, who will take a &s;urvey of the violent and ho&s;tile proceedings of Great-Britain, and of the mea|&s;ures &s;he took to intimidate the&s;e &s;tates, and awe them into unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, prior to their declaration of independence, that every part of her conduct, was calculated to produce this great event; having a direct tendency to plunge the people of America, into a &s;tate of de&s;peration, by cutting them off from every chance of maintain|ing their liberties, in any other way, than by erect|ing them&s;elves into an independent nation, and oppo&s;ing force with force. Now, when we con|&s;ider, that, before our breaking our connection with Great-Britain, the methods and mea&s;ures u&s;ed and pur&s;ued by her, in order to accompli&s;h her unrighteous de&s;igns again&s;t us, and promote her ambitious views, did all uniformly tend to re|duce us to the nece&s;&s;ity of taking that &s;tep, does it not &s;eem, as if &s;he had been left to judicial in|fatuation,

and that her conduct can be&s;t be ac|counted for, by &s;aying, as in the ca&s;e of the re|volt of the ten tribes from Rehoboam, <HI>The cau&s;e was from the Lord?</HI> This (as has been ob&s;erved) is expre&s;ly a&s;&s;igned, as the rea&s;on why Rehoboam <HI>hearkened not to the people,</HI> but <HI>an&s;wered them roughly.</HI> And may we not, with equal proprie|ty, a&s;&s;ign this as the rea&s;on, why the Briti&s;h king, in&s;tead of hearkening to the cries and prayers of his loyal &s;ubjects in America, &s;hould either treat their complaints and petitions with neglect, or an|&s;wer them only with in&s;ult and additional inju|ries, and &s;end forth his fleets and armies, to awe them into &s;ilence, and force them into &s;ervile &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion? May we not rea&s;on thus; <HI>The cau&s;e was from the Lord,</HI> therefore the king of Great-Britain, judicially blinded to his own intere&s;t, hearkened not to the prayers and petitions of the oppre&s;&s;ed and aggrieved people of America; but took &s;uch violent methods, in order to compel them into &s;lavi&s;h pa&s;&s;ive obedience, as reduced them to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of a revolt and final &s;eparation? Had our petitions and prayers been properly regarded, and moderate pacific mea&s;ures pur&s;ued, we &s;hould have entertained no thoughts of a revolt; for even after ho&s;tilities had commenced, we were ardently de&s;irous of continuing united with our mother country, if &s;uch an union could have been pre&s;erved, with|out making a &s;acrifice of our liberties. I am per|&s;uaded, we may &s;afely appeal to that Being, who &s;earches all hearts, to ju&s;tify us, when we declare, that it was far from our intention or inclination to

&s;eparate our&s;elves from Great-Britain; and that we had it not even in contemplation to &s;et up for independency; but on the contrary, earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to remain connected with her, until &s;he had deprived us of all hopes of pre&s;erving &s;uch a connection, upon any better terms than uncon|ditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. It was her refu&s;ing to grant us better terms, that united the&s;e &s;tates, and for|med the confederation, which has connected them together like a band of brethren, and, of many members, made them one compacted and well-cemented body. And that &s;he &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon this, and, depending upon her power to cru&s;h us, &s;hould reject and trample under foot all our petitions, and come again&s;t us with ho&s;tile force, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h an ab&s;olute de&s;potic domi|nion over us, argues that &s;he was left to her own folly (as Rehoboam was) to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures con|trary to her peace, and which, in the natural cour&s;e of things, tended to produce that revolu|tion, which has di&s;membered the Briti&s;h em|pire, and rai&s;ed &s;o great a part of it to a &s;tate of independence.</P>
<P>AND as the wrath of Great-Britain, under the over-ruling providence of GOD, fir&s;t occa&s;ioned this great revolution, &s;o her wrath has hitherto been defeated in all its powerful efforts to reduce us back to a &s;tate of dependence; which can be a&s;cribed to nothing but the interpo&s;ition of a pow|erful Providence, laying re&s;traints upon her, and weakening her hands, &s;o that &s;he could not per|form her enterprizes. For if we look back, and

con&s;ider the &s;trength of our enemies, and our own weak condition, when the awful &s;cenes of war fir&s;t opened upon us, we cannot but acknowledge it to be owing to the &s;pecial interpo&s;ing power of the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of all things, that we were not &s;oon overcome, but have been enabled to maintain our cau&s;e hitherto, in many &s;evere con|flicts, through &s;everal bloody campaigns.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider how unprepared and un|provided we were for the conte&s;t, when ho&s;tilities fir&s;t commenced; that we were without money, without ammunition, without magazines, with|out cloathing for &s;oldiers; that we had neither military di&s;cipline nor any regular &s;ettled civil go|vernment; that we were de&s;titute of that a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from foreign powers, which we have had &s;ince; and, in &s;hort, that under the greate&s;t di&s;|advantages, being deficient in all military prepa|rations, we were forced into a war, with an ene|my, well prepared and well provided with all e&s;|&s;entials for the conflict, having a numerous and well-di&s;ciplined army, commanded by &s;killful and experienced officers, who had been bred to arms; and a navy &s;uperior to any in Europe, which gave them the empire of the &s;eas, and rendered their re&s;ources almo&s;t inexhau&s;tible; when we con&s;i|der the&s;e things, what rea&s;on have we to adopt the language of the P&s;almi&s;t, and &s;ay, <HI>If it had not been the Lord, who was on our &s;ide, our ene|mies would have &s;wallowed us up quick?</HI> E&s;peci|ally, when we con&s;ider further, the peculiar ha|zards and difficulties we were &s;ubjected to, from
<PB N="25" REF="017130_0023_0FA0319C63E7E8E8">
internal enemies, who under the pretext of neu|trality, or the di&s;gui&s;e of friend&s;hip, were con|&s;tantly plotting mi&s;chief again&s;t us, and doing all that they could, with &s;afety, to weaken our hands; to di&s;courage and di&s;hearten us; to ob|&s;truct our operations; to perplex and entangle our affairs; and to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Briti&s;h for|ces. The principal advantages gained, at one time or another, by our profe&s;&s;ed enemies, who have openly waged war again&s;t us, have been greatly owing to a&s;&s;i&s;tances afforded them, by &s;e|cret enemies among our&s;elves, who, had not the mercy of GOD prevented, would, before now, have ruined their country. We have therefore abundant rea&s;on to be thankful to the &s;overeign Ruler of the world, not only that he hath hither|to protected us again&s;t the open violence of our avowed foes; but al&s;o that he hath guarded us again&s;t the treacheries and trea&s;onable con&s;pira|cies, of fal&s;e and di&s;affected per&s;ons, whom we have harboured in our own bo&s;oms; and defeat|ed tho&s;e hidden and mi&s;chievous artifices, which they have u&s;ed to work our de&s;truction.</P>
<P>THE &s;cene of war, in which we have been involved, has been chequered with an alternate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of favourable and unfavourable events. Sometimes we have met with di&s;appointments and defeats, when we had rai&s;ed expectations of &s;ucce&s;s. At other times we have been pro&s;pered, even beyond our mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. In &s;everal in&s;tances our enterprizes have been crown|ed with wonderful &s;ucce&s;s, exceeding our mo&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="017130_0024_0FA031A190D7DFD8">
flattering hopes. And, on the whole, we have great rea&s;on to adore the providence of GOD, who has hitherto remarkably re&s;trained the wrath of our enemies; mercifully defended and pro|tected us; and &s;upported our righteous cau&s;e, by many &s;ignal interpo&s;itions.</P>
<P>To every attentive ob&s;erver, it mu&s;t be obvi|ous, that the wrath of Great-Britain, &s;o far as it has been permitted to exert it&s;elf, has contributed to bring about and e&s;tabli&s;h our independency. It has evidently been the occa&s;ion of events, which have rai&s;ed us to an honorable con&s;ideration a|mong the European powers, and induced &s;ome of them openly to e&s;pou&s;e our cau&s;e, and aid us by a friendly alliance. It is al&s;o worthy of ob|&s;ervation, that the wrath, which has been enkin|dled in American brea&s;ts, has been over-ruled for the promotion of the &s;ame great ends. Great-Britain fir&s;t prepared fewel, and then put fire to the combu&s;tibles, which &s;he had prepared, for &s;etting the pa&s;&s;ions of America into a flame. And the wrath, which &s;he has thus rou&s;ed in Ameri|ca, has been wi&s;ely managed by Providence, for checking and re&s;training her rage and vengeance. Her conduct has not only been the occa&s;ion of &s;tirring up a noble &s;pirit of liberty throughout America, and kindling into a blaze every &s;park of virtuous patrioti&s;m, and true courage; but of firing the mind with hone&s;t indignation and re|&s;entment; yea, of tran&s;porting the pa&s;&s;ions, in &s;ome in&s;tances, among individuals, into criminal exce&s;&s;es. But even the&s;e exce&s;&s;es of the pa&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="27" REF="017130_0025_0FA031A2DEE4D810">
have, by Providence, been made to con&s;pire with better principles, and more laudable &s;prings of ac|tion, to &s;trengthen the oppo&s;ition to Briti&s;h ty|ranny, and check the career of Briti&s;h rage and cruelty.</P>
<P>FAR be it from me to ju&s;tify any exce&s;&s;es of wrath and anger. I am no advocate for outra|ges, even on the mo&s;t provoking occa&s;ions. But I cannot but ob&s;erve, that, as on the one hand, it will not be denied, that the human pa&s;&s;ions have, in &s;ome in&s;tances, among particular per&s;ons broken forth into a criminal exce&s;s of riot; &s;o, on the other, it cannot but be acknowledged, that there have been many in&s;tances of a very cul|pable indifference and tamene&s;s of temper, which, without any emotion, could behold the impend|ing ruin of the country, or have quietly &s;ubmitted to conce&s;&s;ions fatal to liberty.</P>
<P>WE are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that either rea&s;on or re|ligion requires the total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;i|ons. It is both rational, and a duty, to &s;tir them up into exerci&s;e, when &s;uitable objects are pre&s;ent|ed to view. None of our original pa&s;&s;ions, are in them&s;elves vicious. They become vicious on|ly by their exorbitancy. It is the exce&s;s of them that is criminal. While they are tempered with prudence and di&s;cretion, and kept within due bounds, they may be indulged to advantage up|on many occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>THOUGH rage, and inflamed wrath, are no e&s;|&s;ential properties of patrioti&s;m; yet patrioti&s;m,
<PB N="28" REF="017130_0026_0FA031A447CD8730">
without feeling or &s;en&s;ibility, is a meer name. The pa&s;&s;ionate appearance of the &s;ame love of one's country, and of the &s;ame determined zeal for promoting the honor and intere&s;t of it, will indeed be different, in different con&s;titutions. A patriot of a calm and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate temper, tho' he cannot but feel ju&s;t re&s;entment at the wrongs, and injuries done to his country, and &s;hew a &s;tea|dy re&s;olution to do all, that in him lies, to main|tain his country's cau&s;e, again&s;t all its enemies, wil yet not &s;hew the &s;ame vehement warmth, that will di&s;cover it&s;elf in a patriot, of a more &s;an|guine and fiery temper, nor be &s;o liable to be be|trayed, by a fierce zeal, into imprudent and ra&s;h mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>AND here let me ob&s;erve, that to me it &s;eems an argument of the wi&s;dom of GOD, that (as there are few comparatively po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of virtuous principles; and as even the be&s;t principles, with|out a &s;timulus from the pa&s;&s;ions, would remain dormant and inactive; and as the generality are influenced by their pa&s;&s;ions only, which need &s;omething to re&s;train and direct them, or to rou&s;e them up, when the public good calls for great and general exertions) Providence has &s;o ordered it, that there &s;hould be a diver&s;ity of tempers and con&s;titutions among men, to be both a &s;pur and a check to one another; that the more warm and vehement might give an active &s;pring to the more cool and &s;luggi&s;h, and, on the contrary, the more calm and moderate be a curb to the more &s;anguine and ha&s;ty; and that the two extremes,
<PB N="29" REF="017130_0027_0FA031A4CD89BA90">
meeting with tho&s;e, who are more equally tem|pered with due proportions of zeal and prudence, all might happily unite; and, by the mutual col|li&s;ion of their different tempers and pa&s;&s;ions, be enabled to collect their &s;everal powers, into one combined and vigorous effort, for carrying into execution, every nece&s;&s;ary enterprize, again&s;t a common enemy, and for the promotion of the welfare and pro&s;perity of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BUT whatever we may think of the ends of Providence, in ordering &s;uch a diver&s;ity of tem|pers among men, this is certain, that GOD will &s;o manage the mo&s;t di&s;orderly, turbulent and boi&s;terous pa&s;&s;ions, as to make them promotive of the de&s;igns of his government, or lay &s;uch re|&s;traints upon them, that in&s;tead of fru&s;trating, they &s;hall really &s;ub&s;erve the purpo&s;es of his wi&s;|dom. Of this we have had the cleare&s;t evidence, in a variety of in&s;tances in the cour&s;e of the pre|&s;ent war; which affords &s;ub&s;tantial ground for a rational hope and tru&s;t in GOD, for the future.</P>
<P>HAD the power of Great-Britain been equal to her wrath, what a mi&s;erable and wretched &s;itua|tion &s;hould we have been in, before now! From the rage and vindictivene&s;s, which &s;he has di&s;co|vered; from the threats which &s;he has thrown out; and from the barbarous cruelties which have marked her &s;teps in the pro&s;ecution of the pre&s;ent war (e&s;pecially when &s;he gained any ad|vantages over us) we may ea&s;ily infer what would be our unhappy fate, &s;hould her wrath prevail, at
<PB N="30" REF="017130_0028_0FA031A565B3B7D8">
la&s;t, and force us to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. In this ca&s;e, all would be &s;eizure and proce&s;s, confi&s;|cation and impri&s;onment, blood and horror, in|&s;olence and arbitrary puni&s;hment. For &s;o it al|ways has been, and always will be, when what is called a rebellion is &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the &s;uppo&s;ed rebels obliged to throw them&s;elves uncondition|ally upon the mercy of their incen&s;ed prince.</P>
<P>GREAT-BRITAIN indeed, &s;ince our alliance with France, has made a &s;hew of offering a re|dre&s;s of grievances, and of granting us even more than we a&s;ked for, before our declaration of in|dependence; on condition of our re-uniting our|&s;elves with her, in violation of our national faith and honor, which we have &s;olemnly plighted to our generous ally; but &s;hould we comply with this condition, what &s;ecurity could we have of her la&s;ting friend&s;hip? Philip, of Spain, when he found that his arbitrary proceedings had thrown his &s;ubjects, in the low countries, into a ferment and flame, and rai&s;ed &s;uch an oppo&s;ition to his government, as he was unable immediately to &s;uppre&s;s, was once prevailed upon by the re|pre&s;entations of the governe&s;s, the Duche&s;s of Parma, to hearken to their complaints and pe|titions, and grant a redre&s;s of grievances; in con&s;equence of which, things in general, &s;oon returned to a toilerably quiet and peaceable &s;tate. But notwith&s;tanding this &s;eeming compliance with the de&s;ires of his &s;ubjects, Philip only meant to gain time, being determined, as &s;oon as cir|cum&s;tances &s;hould be more favourable, to pro&s;e|cute
<PB N="31" REF="017130_0029_0FA031A628855A20">
his ambitious and tyrannical &s;chemes. Ac|cordingly, in a little while, he commi&s;&s;ioned the Duke of Alva, at the head of a large army of ve|teran troops, to carry the &s;ame into the mo&s;t ri|gorous execution: This conduct of his, rekindled the flame, and revived tho&s;e commotions, which eventually co&s;t Spain a great part of her low coun|try provinces. Should we, in contradiction to our &s;olemn engagements to others, return to our con|nection with Great-Britain, upon the plan propo&s;ed by her commi&s;&s;ioners (who, by the way, are not empowered to ratify any thing) we might &s;oon, af|ter the example of the low countries, be again o|bliged to &s;eperate from her, and to fly to arms for our defence. And in this ca&s;e &s;he would have a fairer chance of &s;ubjugating us, and we &s;hould be in the utmo&s;t danger of falling a prey to her pow|er and wrath, becau&s;e, having violated our faith with foreign powers, they would hardly be per|&s;uaded to tru&s;t us again, or to afford us tho&s;e &s;up|plies and &s;uccours, that we might &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>IT is doubtle&s;s the ardent de&s;ire of every one, now pre&s;ent, to &s;ee a &s;peedy and happy end to the war. But can any &s;uppo&s;e, that a &s;eperate compo&s;ition with Great-Britain, upon her terms, would re&s;tore public peace and tranquility, and clo&s;e the &s;cenes of war? Have we not rather rea|&s;on to believe, that it would oblige us immedi|ately to engage in her quarrel with tho&s;e, who have befriended us in our di&s;tre&s;s, and a&s;&s;i&s;t her in avenging her&s;elf upon them, for the aid which
<PB N="32" REF="017130_0030_0FA031A6F167ACB0">
they afforded us? A &s;eparate peace with Great-Britain, upon any other plan, than that of equali|ty and mutual independence, would plunge <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> directly into a war with France and Spain, who would have rea&s;on to re&s;ent &s;uch a flagrant viola|tion of our national faith and honor. And pro|bably it would al&s;o arm many other European powers again&s;t us. We can therefore have no hopeful pro&s;pect, of enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, or of enjoying them long, but upon the plan of independency.</P>
<P>THE appeal has been made to Heaven, and Heaven has hitherto &s;upported us, and re&s;trained the wrath of our enemies. Tru&s;ting in GOD therefore, we &s;hould take courage &s;till to <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t in the liberties, wherewith he has made us free,</HI> without fondly de&s;iring any di&s;honorable and dan|gerous compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>BUT though from the great things which GOD has done for us, we are encouraged to hope, that his providence will, in due time, work com|pleat &s;alvation for us, if we continue to exert our&s;elves, as becometh free men; yet no one can certainly tell what will be the i&s;&s;ue of the pre|&s;ent conte&s;t, or how it will terminate. The vo|lumns of futurity are looked again&s;t human in|&s;pection; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the event of any human enterprize or undertaking. Our concern &s;hould be, to make the great Governor of futurity our friend, as we de&s;ire the kind a&s;&s;i&s;t|ances of his propitious providence, to bring our enemies to make peace with us, upon terms of honor, ju&s;tice and equality.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="017130_0031_0FA031A7AC9F1C68">AND here, let me ob&s;erve, that nothing dar|kens our pro&s;pects more, or gives us more rea&s;on to be fearful, as to the event of the pre&s;ent con|te&s;t, than the great and general prevalence of un|righteou&s;ne&s;s among us. He mu&s;t have been very unob&s;erving, who does not know, that by means of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, the body-politic has been, and &s;till is, labouring under a dangerous di&s;ea&s;e&punc; the <HI>whole head being &s;ick and the whole heart faint,</HI> and there being but little <HI>&s;oundne&s;s, from the crown of the head to the &s;ole of the foot.</HI></P>
<P>THE goodne&s;s of our cau&s;e does not make &s;uc|ce&s;s certain. A good cau&s;e often &s;uffers, and is &s;ometimes lo&s;t, by means of the &s;in and folly of tho&s;e, who are engaged in it. This is a con&s;i|deration, which ought to lie with weight on our minds, at the pre&s;ent day, and engage us to <HI>put away the evil of our doings,</HI> and <HI>keep our&s;elves from every wicked thing.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN Solomon &s;ays, <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation,</HI> he a&s;&s;erts no more, than what the expe|rience of all ages has found to be true. For righteou&s;ne&s;s not only procures the &s;miles of a propitious Providence upon a people; but al&s;o tends, in the natural cour&s;e of things, to promote their pro&s;perity; being adapted to prevent di&s;&s;en|tions and di&s;cords among them, to cement them together in the firme&s;t union, and, by pre&s;erving public and private credit, to enable them to col|lect their force and &s;trength, when the ca&s;e re|quires, for repelling an invading enemy, and de|fending them&s;elves again&s;t all the ho&s;tile attempts
<PB N="34" REF="017130_0032_0FA031A86B742540">
of a&s;piring ambition. The effects of unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s are very different; for unrighteou&s;ne&s;s not only provokes GOD to withold his ble&s;&s;ings from a people; but it al&s;o tends, in its own na|ture, to entangle and perplex their affairs, and to render them weak, and unable to oppo&s;e any vi|olent a&s;&s;aults of arbitrary power, by creating a|mong them internal &s;trife and contention; by di|viding them into angry parties; by de&s;troying mutual tru&s;t and confidence; and &s;o rendering it extremely difficult, and next to impo&s;&s;ible, to u|nite them in mea&s;ures, nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;afety and defence again&s;t a common enemy, or the de&s;|potic views of de&s;igning ambition.</P>
<P>WE have therefore rea&s;on to fear, if unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould continue to abound, that the righ|teous Judge of the world, will cea&s;e to re&s;train the wrath of our enemies, and, leaving us in the hands of our own folly, permit them to execute the dreadful purpo&s;es of their furious re&s;entments, as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment for our ob&s;tinate per&s;eve|rance in our evil ways. But if we will put away our unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>cea&s;e to do evil, and learn to do well,</HI> we &s;hall have grounds to hope, that the <HI>righteous Lord, who loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> will &s;till be our friend and patron, and enable us to main|tain our cau&s;e, again&s;t the utmo&s;t force of our en|raged enemies, until they are brought to rea&s;on or ruin. For,
<Q><L>"To the righteous, GOD is near,</L>
<L>"And never will their cau&s;e for&s;ake."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="017130_0033_0FA031A936D89A88">THOUGH GOD is plea&s;ed to employ the wrath of our enemies, as a rod of correction, to puni&s;h us, for our &s;ins; and may permit them to pro|ceed to great lengths, in the pro&s;ecution of their arbitrary and unrighteous &s;chemes, in order to teach us righteou&s;ne&s;s, and make us pious and virtuous; yet their conduct is neverthele&s;s odi|ous and abominable in his &s;ight, and will not (as we have rea&s;on to believe) pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed. We may therefore a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that when we leave our &s;ins, and become an obedient people, GOD will bring to nought all their mi&s;chievous de&s;igns, either by di&s;po&s;ing them to peace, or by leaving them to follow the lead of their own haughty temper, until they plunge them&s;elves in|to de&s;truction. For GOD often turns the op|pre&s;&s;ion of the oppre&s;&s;or upon his own head, and cau&s;es him, in the end, to fall into the pit which he digged for others. And a people, who have &s;marted under the cruel rod of oppre&s;&s;ion, may rationally expect this, when they are &s;uitably pre|pared for &s;alvation by repentance and reforma|tion. For the mo&s;t powerful and &s;ucce&s;sful op|pre&s;&s;ors, are only rods of GOD's &s;chool (like the proud A&s;&s;yrian beforementioned) and when he has an&s;wered the de&s;igns of his providence by them, he u&s;ually lets loo&s;e his wrath upon them, and puni&s;hes them for their arrogance, pride and mi&s;chievous ambition. The de&s;truction which &s;ometimes falls upon &s;uch men, is finely de&s;cribed in the fifteenth chapter of the book of Job, from the 31&s;t ver&s;e to the end, which I will give you in the words of an elegant modern ver&s;ion:
<Q><PB N="36" REF="017130_0034_0FA031A9E2FC3128">
<L>"Woe to the man, who by oppre&s;&s;ion climbs,</L>
<L>"Drunk with &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and &s;ecure in crimes&punc;</L>
<L>"For bitter change &s;hall come; untimely bla&s;t</L>
<L>"His boughs &s;hall wither, and his fruit &s;hall ca&s;t.</L>
<L>"As when the vine her half-grown berries &s;howers,</L>
<L>"Or poi&s;on'd olive, her unfolding flowers.</L>
<L>"Know, all ye wicked, all ye venal crew,</L>
<L>"Your &s;plendid tents the &s;hulking bribe &s;hall rue;</L>
<L>"A fire it kindles, and the flame &s;upplies,</L>
<L>"'Till the gay &s;cene a di&s;mal de&s;art lies.</L>
<L>"See now oppre&s;&s;ion (and its boa&s;ted gain)</L>
<L>"Conceiv'd, and u&s;her'd into birth in vain;</L>
<L>"The flattering crime, which &s;o much angui&s;h bred,</L>
<L>"Turns all its plagues on its own parent's head."</L></Q></P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, let me apply my&s;elf, in a few words to the militia of this town, who ap|pear under arms, on this memorable occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>SIRS,</P>
<P>THE manner of your ob&s;erving this day, in commemoration of the commencement of the pre&s;ent war, the &s;cene whereof, was fir&s;t opened in this place, does you honor, as it gives an evi|dence, at once, of your piety, and of your patri|oti&s;m and firm attachment to the cau&s;e of your country. With hone&s;t indignation we recollect the day, when the &s;torm of Briti&s;h vengeance,
<PB N="37" REF="017130_0035_0FA031AD1C483818">
which had been long gathering, fir&s;t bur&s;t upon your heads, in the wanton ma&s;&s;acre of &s;everal of your brave fellow citizens and &s;oldiers. The memory of tho&s;e, who have magnanimou&s;ly jeoparded their lives, and &s;hed their blood in their country's cau&s;e, will ever be dear to us. We particularly retain an honorable remembrance of tho&s;e, who fir&s;t fell a &s;acrifice to Briti&s;h wrath; and feel emotions of &s;ympathy towards their &s;urviving relatives, who cannot but be &s;en&s;ibly affected on this occa&s;ion. We would al&s;o join with you, in grateful acknow|ledgments to GOD, who mercifully checked the wrath of our enemies in its fir&s;t eruptions, and cau&s;ed it to recoil back on their own heads. We doubt not, but from the warmth of hone&s;t re&s;ent|ment; from a love of liberty and of your coun|try, you will per&s;evere to oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e in&s;olent and haughty enemies, of who&s;e wanton cruelty, you have had too melancholy a &s;pecimen, to permit you to expect much mercy at their hands, &s;hould they gain their point.</P>
<P>LET me now ob&s;erve, that your appearing equipt in military armour, as &s;oldiers prepared for war, naturally leads to reflections on the pernici|ous influence of tho&s;e corrupt lu&s;ts of human na|ture, <HI>from whence come wars.</HI> They who would be glad to <HI>live peaceably with all men,</HI> are often unhappily forced into contention, and obliged to take arms, and engage in hazardous conte&s;ts, in order to defend their lives and liberties, again&s;t the evil de&s;igns of unrea&s;onable men, who when they &s;uppo&s;e they have power and &s;trength to ac|compli&s;h
<PB N="38" REF="017130_0036_0FA031AE8BE50F28">
their purpo&s;es, &s;cruple not to give un|bounded &s;cope to their pride, covetou&s;ne&s;s and ambition; which pa&s;&s;ions are mortal enemies to the rights of mankind, and the &s;ource of that &s;la|very and cruel bondage, under which &s;o many of the nations of the earth groan at this day.</P>
<P>A CONSIDERATION of the pernicious influ|ence and effects of the&s;e corrupt lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould engage you and &s;hould engage us all, to mor|tify them in our&s;elves. For where they prevail, they not only lead to a conduct prejudicial to the peace and welfare of human &s;ociety, but make men &s;laves in the wor&s;t &s;en&s;e, how much &s;oever they may hate the name.</P>
<P>WHILE therefore, you are engaged with a laudable zeal in the cau&s;e of civil liberty, you will permit me to remind you, that there is another kind of liberty of an higher and nobler nature, which it is of infinite importance to every one to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; I mean that glorious internal li|berty, which con&s;i&s;ts in a freedom from the do|minion of &s;in, and in the habit and practice of all the virtues of a good life. This is that noble and exalted liberty of the <HI>&s;ons of God,</HI> of which our &s;aviour &s;peaks, when he &s;ays, <HI>If the &s;on of God &s;hall make you free, then &s;hall ye be free indeed.</HI> And this, once gained, will in&s;pire you with the greate&s;t magnanimity and fortitude, in the cau&s;e of outward liberty. For <HI>the righteous are bold as a lion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="017130_0037_0FA031B253CCE4B8">To conclude. Let us all, with that ardor and earne&s;tne&s;s, which the importance of the thing re|quires, labour after this <HI>glorious liberty of the &s;ons of God</HI>; that when we &s;hall quit this tumultuous warring world, (having acted our parts well in it) we may be admitted to tho&s;e peaceful man&s;ions, where, free from &s;trife and contention, and all the pernicious effects of ungoverned wrath and ambition, we &s;hall enjoy a ble&s;&s;ed immortality, in the tranquil uninterrupted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every felicity that our natures are capable of.</P>
