<HEAD>A LETTER TO THE Reverend Dr. DURELL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEING a Ma&s;ter of I&s;rael, and placed at the head of one of the mo&s;t renowned &s;eats of Learning in the world, you need not be informed that the Mi&s;&s;ion of the HOLY GHOST is the one grand promi&s;e of the New, at the coming of JESUS CHRIST was the great promi&s;e of the Old Te&s;tament di&s;pen|&s;ation.&mdash;"I will pray the Father, &s;ays our ble&s;&s;ed LORD to his almo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate Di&s;ciples, and he &s;hall give you another Comforter." And again, "It is expedient for you, that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart (it being the purcha&s;e of his all-atoning blood, and de&s;igned to be the immediate fruit and proof of the reality of his re&s;urrection, and &s;ub&s;equent a&s;cen&s;ion into Heaven) I will &s;end Him unto you." And that they might know that this Comforter was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> confined to or mono|polized by them, but was to be of &s;tanding general u&s;e, He immediately gives them intimations of the de&s;ign and nature of his office: and therefore adds, "and when he is come, he will convince the world of &s;in, and of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and of judgment."</P>
<P>Strange and till then unheard-of, promi&s;e this! Such as a Confucius, Zoroa&s;ter, or any other fictitious unin&s;pir|ed Prophet or Lawgiver never dreamt of. A promi&s;e, which none but One, who was GOD over all, could dare
<PB N="4" REF="011117_0003_0F8537E7824F3790">
to make; a promi&s;e which none but One, who was GOD over all, could po&s;&s;ibly fulfil.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this promi&s;e, having a&s;cended up on high, led captivity captive, and received this gift for men, this divine Paraclete, this Holy Gho&s;t, on the day of Penteco&s;t, came down from heaven like a ru&s;hing mighty wind; and there appeared cloven tongues, like as of fire, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon each of the Apo&s;tles."&mdash;The effects were immediate and vi&s;ible&mdash;Poor, illiterate Fi&s;her|men, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly commenced Scholars, Preachers, Orators. And well they might; for, being filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, as the Spirit gave them utterance, they began to &s;peak with other tongues the wonderful things of God.</P>
<P>But what was all this divine apparatus, this divine preaching, this divine oratory intended for? The fol|lowing ver&s;es inform us: The hearers of tho&s;e won|derful things, the &s;pectators of this tran&s;cendently amaz|ing &s;cene, "were pricked to the heart, and were made to cry out, Men and Brethren, what &s;hall we do? And the &s;ame day were added to this infant church about three thou&s;and &s;ouls." Here were proofs, &s;ub&s;tantial, inconte&s;tible proofs, of the reality of the Re&s;urrection, A&s;cen&s;ion, and likewi&s;e of the Efficacy of the all-power|ful Interce&s;&s;ion of their once crucified, but now exalted LORD; not only &s;ub&s;tantial and inconte&s;tible, but at the &s;ame time entirely&punc; &s;uitable to the nature of his Mi&s;&s;ion, who in the days of his fle&s;h by his doctrines and miracles declared, that his only de&s;ign in coming into the world, was to &s;ave &s;inners.</P>
<P>Upon this rock, namely, an experimental manife&s;ta|tion and application of his Divinity to the renewed heart (which fle&s;h and blood, human Rea&s;on, vain Phi|lo&s;ophy, moral Sua&s;ion, or any, or all barely external evidence what&s;oever cannot reveal) hath he built, doth he now build, and will continue to build his church;
<PB N="5" REF="011117_0004_0F8537E849B96CF8">
and therefore it is that the gates, neither the power or policy of hell, &s;hall ever prevail again&s;t it. By the influence of this almighty Agent hath he promi&s;ed to be with his mini&s;ters and people, even to the end of the world. And agreeable to this, hath taught us daily to pray that his Kingdom may come; which being to be begun, carried on and completed, by one con|tinued emanation of divine influence communicated to believers in the u&s;e of all appointed means, can alone enable us to do GOD's will on earth, with any degree of that unanimity, chearfulne&s;s, univer&s;ality and per&s;e|verance, as it is done by the holy angels above. And as this is the daily united prayer of the whole catholic Church, however di&s;tre&s;&s;ed or di&s;per&s;ed, and however varying as to circum&s;tantials and non-e&s;&s;entials, over the whole earth; it followeth, that every addition of any individual monument of divine mercy, out of every nation, language or tongue, mu&s;t be looked upon in part as an an&s;wer to the daily prayer of every individual believer under Heaven.</P>
<P>Hence, no doubt, it is, that as the Angels are &s;ent forth to be mini&s;tring &s;pirits, to mini&s;ter to tho&s;e who &s;hall be heirs of &s;alvation, that there is &s;aid to be joy in Heaven over every &s;inner that repenteth. And as there is joy in Heaven, &s;o in proportion as they ri&s;e into the nature of Angels, will there be joy al&s;o upon the &s;ame account among&s;t good men on earth. Accor|dingly, the lively Oracles inform us, that "when the Apo&s;tles and Brethren which were in Judea heard that the Gentiles al&s;o had received the word of GOD, they glorified Him, &s;aying, Then hath GOD al&s;o to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life."</P>
<P>And conformably to this, we are told, that "when Barnabas came to Antioch, and &s;aw the grace of GOD, he was glad." And why? Becau&s;e he was a good man, and full of the Holy Gho&s;t and of faith. And as the
<PB N="6" REF="011117_0005_0F8537EB0C8E14B0">
&s;ame cau&s;e will always be productive of the &s;ame effect, per&s;ons endued with the &s;ame benign and godlike di&s;|po&s;ition with this good man, will always be glad when they &s;ee or hear of any &s;criptural marks or practical evidences of true and undefiled Religion, wrought in, or appearing upon any &s;ubject of divine grace what|&s;oever. And this joy mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ri&s;e, in proportion as &s;uch &s;ubjects, either by their abilities or circum&s;tances, and &s;ituation in life, promi&s;e more important and exten|&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s in the world and church of GOD.</P>
<P>No wonder therefore, Reverend SIR, that it hath gladdened the hearts of many, and afforded matter of uncommon joy and thank&s;giving to the Father of mercies and GOD of all con&s;olation, to hear, that for &s;ome time pa&s;t there hath been a more than common religious concern and zeal for promoting their own and others &s;alvation among &s;ome of the Sons of the Pro|phets. What a plea&s;ing pro&s;pect hath hereby been opened of a future ble&s;&s;ing to the ri&s;ing generation! A ble&s;&s;ing, which we well hoped, would be not le&s;s &s;alutary and beneficial to the moral, than the new cru&s;e of &s;alt, which the prophet Eli&s;ha, when complaint was made that the water was naught and the ground barren, ca&s;t into the &s;pring of waters, with a Thus &s;aith the LORD, I have healed the&s;e waters, was to part of the natural world. "There &s;hall not be from thence, &s;ays the prophet, any more death or barren land: So the waters were healed unto this day."</P>
<P>But alas! how is this general joy damped, and the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect almo&s;t totally eclip&s;ed, by a late me|lancholy &s;cene exhibited in that very place from whence, as from a fountain, many of their preachers frequently and expre&s;ly pray, that pure &s;treams may forever flow to water the city of the living GOD? You need not be told, Reverend SIR, what place I mean. It was the famous Univer&s;ity of Oxford. Nor need I mention
<PB N="7" REF="011117_0006_0F8537EC0DB5B460">
the &s;cene exhibited; it was a tribunal, a vi&s;itatorial tribunal, erected in Edmund Hall&mdash;&s;ix pious &s;tudents, who promi&s;ed to be the &s;alt of the earth, and lights of the world, entire friends to the Doctrines and Liturgy of our Church, by a Citation previou&s;ly fixed upon the College door, were &s;ummoned to appear before this tribunal. They did appear; and, as &s;ome were plea&s;ed to term it, were tried, convicted, and to clo&s;e the &s;cene, in the chapel of the &s;ame Hall, con&s;ecrated and &s;et apart for nobler purpo&s;es, had the &s;entence of Expul&s;ion publickly read and pronounced again&s;t them.</P>
<P>So &s;evere a &s;entence, in an age when almo&s;t every kind of proper di&s;cipline is held with &s;o lax a rein, hath naturally excited a curio&s;ity in all that have heard of it, to inquire what notable crime the&s;e delinquents may have been guilty of to de&s;erve &s;uch uncommonly rigorous treatment. But how will their curio&s;ity be turned into indignation, when they are told, that they were thus rigorou&s;ly handled for doing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o evil at all, and that no fault could be found in them, &s;ave in the law of their GOD?</P>
<P>It is true indeed, one article of impeachment was, "that &s;ome of them were of Trades before they en|tered into the Univer&s;ity." But what evil or crime worthy of expul&s;ion can there be in that? To be called from any, though the meane&s;t mechanic employ, to the &s;tudy of the liberal arts, where a natural Genius hath been given, was never yet looked upon as a reproach to, or diminution of, any great and public character what&s;oever. Profane Hi&s;tory affords us a variety of examples of the greate&s;t Heroes who have been fetched even from the plough, to command armies, and perform the greate&s;t exploits for their Country's good. And if we examine &s;acred Hi&s;tory, we &s;hall find, that even David, after he was anointed King, looked back with &s;weet complacence to the rock from whence he was
<PB N="8" REF="011117_0007_0F8537ECC62F5BD8">
hewn, and is not a&s;hamed to leave it upon record, that GOD took him away from the &s;he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">folds, as he was following the ewes great with young ones; (as though he loved to repeat it) he took him, &s;ays he, that he might feed Jacob his people, and I&s;rael his inheritance.</P>
<P>But why &s;peak I of David? When JESUS of Nazareth, David's LORD, and David's KING, had for his reputed father&punc; a Carpenter, and in all proba|bility (as it was a common proverb among the Jews, that "he that did not teach his &s;on a Trade, taught "him to be a Thief;") worked at the trade of a Car|penter him&s;elf? For this indeed he was reproached and maligned; "Is not this, &s;aid they, the Carpenter's &s;on? Nay, Is not this the Carpenter?" But who were tho&s;e maligners? The greate&s;t enemies to the power of godline&s;s the world ever &s;aw; the Scribes and Phari&s;ees; that generation of vipers, as John the Bapti&s;t calls them, who upon every occa&s;ion were &s;pit|ting out their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">om, and &s;hooting forth their arrows, even bitter words, again&s;t that &s;on of man, even that &s;on of GOD, who, to di&s;play his &s;overeignty, and con|found the wi&s;dom of the worldly wi&s;e, cho&s;e poor Fi&s;hermen to be his Apo&s;tles; and who&s;e chiefe&s;t of the Apo&s;tles, though bred up at the feet of Gamaliel, both before and after his call to the Apo&s;tle&s;hip, la|boured with his own hands, and worked at the trade of a Tent-maker.</P>
<P>If from &s;uch exalted and more di&s;tant, we de&s;cend to more modern and inferior characters, we &s;hall find, that very late, not to &s;ay our pre&s;ent times, furni&s;h us with in&s;tances of &s;ome, even of our Dignitaries, who have been called from Trades that tended to help and feed the body, not only to higher employs of a &s;piri|tual nature, but even to pre&s;ide over tho&s;e that are entru&s;ted with the cure of &s;ouls. And who knows but &s;ome of the&s;e young Students, though originally me|chanics,
<PB N="9" REF="011117_0008_0F8537F216AF3488">
if they had been &s;uffered to have pur&s;ued their &s;tudies, might have either climbed after them to &s;ome preferment in the Church, or been advanced to &s;ome office in that Univer&s;ity from which they are now expelled? One of the pre&s;ent reverend and worthy Proctors, we are told, was formerly a Lieutenant in the Army; and as &s;uch a military employ was no impedi|ment to his being a Mini&s;ter or Proctor, it may be pre|&s;umed, that being formerly of Trades could have been no ju&s;t impediment to the&s;e young mens becoming in proce&s;s of time true Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters and good Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>Their being accu&s;tomed to prayer, whether with or without a form, I humbly apprehend, would by no means di&s;qualify them for the private or public di&s;charge of any part of their mini&s;terial function. "In that day, that Go&s;pel-day, (the&s;e la&s;t days wherein we live) &s;aith the great GOD&punc; I will pour cut a Spirit of grace and a Spirit of &s;upplication upon the hou&s;e of David and upon the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem." And the Apo&s;tle Paul &s;peaks of it as the common privilege of all Believers, that the Holy Spirit helps their infirmities, and maketh in|terce&s;&s;ion for them with groanings which cannot be ut|tered. Forms of prayer, certainly, have their u&s;e; and take it altogether, our Engli&s;h Liturgy is, without doubt, one of the mo&s;t excellent e&s;tabli&s;hed forms of public prayer in the world: but then, as no form in the very nature of the thing, can po&s;&s;ibly &s;uit every particular ca&s;e, it is to be feared that many mu&s;t never pray, at lea&s;t for the particular things they mo&s;t &s;tand in need of, if they are &s;o to be tied up to their forms, that they cannot vary from them, or u&s;e free prayer at all.</P>
<P>The great Bi&s;hop Wilkins hath therefore wisely wrote an excellent Treati&s;e on the benefit and importance of this kind of prayer; and could our Univer&s;ity-youth be trained up to u&s;e proper extempore prayer, both before
<PB N="10" REF="011117_0009_0F8537F3D45E5718">
and after &s;ermon, in the opinion of all good judges, it would be as commendable, as that &s;trange cu&s;tom of putting off our auditories with what is called the <HI>bidding prayer;</HI> in which there is not one petition for a ble&s;&s;ing upon the following Sermon, and &s;carce any thing men|tioned but what hath been prayed for over and over again in the preceding common &s;ervice of our church.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch liberty &s;hould be denied in public, as ble&s;&s;ed be GOD it is not, &s;urely we may be allowed, at lea&s;t it cannot be deemed &s;inful, to u&s;e free prayer in our &s;ecret or private &s;ocial exerci&s;es of dev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tion. If &s;o, what &s;inners, what great &s;inners mu&s;t they have been, who prayed, and that too out of nece&s;&s;ity, in an extem|pore way, before any forms of prayer were or could be printed or heard of? The prayers we read of in &s;crip|ture, the prayers which opened and &s;hut heaven, the effectual, fervent, energetic prayers of tho&s;e righteous and holy men of old, which availed &s;o much with GOD, were all of an extempore nature. And I am apt to be|lieve, if not only our Students and Mini&s;ters, but private Chri&s;tians, were born from above, and taught of GOD, as tho&s;e wre&s;tlers with GOD were, they would want Forms of Prayer, though we have &s;uch a variety of them, no more than they did.</P>
<P>The Sick, the Lame, the Blind, the Lepers that came to our Lord for healing, wanted no book to teach them how to expre&s;s their wants. Though &s;ome were only poor Beggars, and others, as the &s;elf-righteous Scribes and Phari&s;ees &s;uperciliou&s;ly cho&s;e to term them, Gentile dogs, yet con&s;cious of their wants, and having a heart|felt &s;en&s;e of their di&s;tre&s;s, "out of the abundance of their hearts their mouths &s;pake; and the compa&s;&s;ionate IMMANUEL, who came to heal our &s;ickne&s;&s;es and bear our infirmities, &s;ent them away with a "Go in peace, thy faith hath made thee whole: Be it unto thee even as thou wilt."</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="011117_0010_0F8537F4547C1078">
How unlike, yea how very unlike &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion is the treatment the&s;e young Students have lately met with at Edmund Hall, who, among&s;t other crimes of a like nature, were expelled for u&s;ing extem|pore prayer. A crime not &s;o much as mentioned in any of our Law-Books; a crime for which, in this la&s;t century at lea&s;t, no one hath ever been called to the bar of any public court of judicature; and a crime for which it is to be hoped, no Student will ever hereafter be &s;um|moned to appear and hear him&s;elf expelled for, at the bar of any of the reverend Doctors of Divinity or Heads of Hou&s;es in the Univer&s;ity of Oxford. But &s;hould any be &s;o infatuated as to determine, Jehu-like, to drive on thus furiou&s;ly, as judgment hath unhappily begun, as it were, at the very hou&s;e of GOD, it is to be hoped, that as &s;ome have been expelled for extempore praying, we &s;hall hear of &s;ome few others of a contrary &s;tamp, being expelled for extempore &s;wearing, which by all impartial judges mu&s;t undoubtedly be acknowledge to be the greater crime of the two.</P>
<P>Singing, compo&s;ing, or reading Hymns compo&s;ed by others, and doing this in company, &s;eems to be as little criminal as praying extempore. When the la&s;t words of David are about to be recorded, he is not only &s;tiled, "the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e, the man who was rai&s;ed up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob," but the grand title of being "the &s;weet P&s;almi&s;t of I&s;rael" brings up the rear. And "to teach and admoni&s;h one another in p&s;alms, and hymns, and &s;piritual &s;ongs," is as truly a &s;criptural command, as "Thou &s;halt love the LORD thy GOD with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy &s;trength, and thy neighbour as thy&s;elf."</P>
<P>When Eli&s;ha the Prophet was about to prophe&s;y before two kings, he called for a min&s;trel, on which he played, to &s;ooth his ruffled pa&s;&s;ions, and prepare his heart the better for the reception of the Holy Spirit
<PB N="12" REF="011117_0011_0F8537F506CCC0D0">
And were the Sons of the Prophets more frequently to entertain them&s;elves thus, I believe it would be as &s;uita|ble to the mini&s;terial character, and recommend them as much, perhaps more, to all &s;erious Chri&s;tians&punc; than their tripping up their heels, &s;kipping and dancing at the mu&s;ic of a Ball-room, or playing even a fir&s;t Fiddle at a concert. And was the voice of &s;piritual melody more frequently heard by tho&s;e who come occa&s;ionally to vi&s;it our Colleges, it might be as much to the honour of the Univer&s;ity, as the more common and too, too frequent noi&s;e of Box and Dice, at the unlawful games of Hazard and Back-gammon.</P>
<P>Popi&s;h countries, Popi&s;h &s;eminaries, think it no &s;hame, no di&s;grace to be heard &s;inging the high prai&s;es of their GOD in their Convents, their Hou&s;es, or even in their Streets; and why Prote&s;tants in general, and Prote&s;tants Students in particular, &s;hould be any more a&s;hamed of, or re&s;trained from the free exerci&s;e of &s;uch acts of devotion, either in &s;ecret or in private &s;ocieties, no good rea&s;on can be given; unle&s;s it be proved to be good rea&s;oning to a&s;&s;ert, that Prote&s;tants ought to be le&s;s devout than Papi&s;ts. We mu&s;t confe&s;s that Papi&s;ts, though they take this liberty of &s;inging and chanting privately and publicly them&s;elves, yet deny this liberty of con&s;cience to our Prote&s;tant a&s;&s;emblies, tho&s;e attending divine wor&s;hip at our Amba&s;&s;ador's chapels not excepted. But for Prote&s;tants to di&s;u&s;e it them&s;elves, and at the &s;ame time lay as it were a &s;piri|tual embargo upon their fellow Prote&s;tants, nay puni&s;h and expel them for &s;o doing, is very unaccountable.</P>
<P>What &s;pirit then mu&s;t tho&s;e be of, Reverend SIR, who have lately joined in pronouncing the &s;entence of expul&s;ion again&s;t &s;ix religious Students, not only for having been of Trades, and praying extempore, but for reading, and &s;inging Hymns al&s;o? His Royal Highne&s;s the late Duke of Cumberland, was of a very
<PB N="13" REF="011117_0012_0F8537F5C352D098">
different di&s;po&s;ition, for when abroad in Germany, in one of our late wars, (as I was informed by a per&s;on then on guard) hearing one evening as he was pa&s;&s;ing by, a company of &s;oldiers &s;inging at &s;ome di&s;tance in a cave, he a&s;ked the centinel what noi&s;e that was; and being an&s;wered that &s;ome devout &s;oldiers were &s;inging Hymns; in&s;tead of citing them to appear before their Officers, ordering them to the whipping po&s;t, or com|manding them to be drummed out of the regiment; acting like him&s;elf, he only plea&s;ingly replied, "Are they &s;o? Let them go on then, and be as merry as they can." In this he acted wi&s;ely; for he knew, and found by repeated experience, as did other commanding officers, that &s;inging, nay, and praying extempore too, in the&s;e private &s;ocieties, did not hinder, but rather &s;itted and animated the&s;e devout &s;oldiers to engage, and to fight their country's battles in the field. And it may be pre&s;umed, that if the&s;e Students had not been expelled for &s;inging Hymns, and praying extempore they certainly would not have been le&s;s, but in all probability much better prepared for handling the &s;word of the Spirit, the Word of GOD, and fighting there|with, either from the Pre&s;s or the Pulpit, the battles of the LORD of ho&s;ts.</P>
<P>To &s;ee or hear &s;uch divine exerci&s;es treated with reproach, and &s;poken of with contempt by common and open bla&s;phemers, is bad, but that any who came on purpo&s;e to be trained up for the &s;acred work of the Mini&s;try, &s;hould be looked on as criminal, and expelled a Univer&s;ity for being &s;ometimes employed in them, is too &s;ad a proof not only that "our gold is become dim, and our fine gold changed, but that our very foundations are out of cour&s;e." What then mu&s;t the righteous do?</P>

<P>It is recorded in the Old Te&s;tament, that in a de|generate age, "tho&s;e that feared the LORD &s;pake often one to another; that the LORD hearkened and heard, and that a book of remembrance was written before him for tho&s;e that feared the LORD, and thought on his name: and they &s;hall be mine in that day, &s;aith the LORD, when I make up my jewels; and I will &s;pare them as a man &s;pareth his own &s;on that &s;erveth him." Thus it was in the Old Te&s;tament times. Nor are &s;uch meetings mentioned with le&s;s approbation in the New: for therein, in order that we may hold the profe&s;&s;ion of our faith without wavering, we are commanded to "con&s;ider one another, to provoke unto love and to good works; not for&s;aking the a&s;&s;embling our&s;elves together, but exhorting one another, and &s;o much the more, as we &s;ee the day approaching." Nay, one immediate con&s;equence of that grand effu&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t on the day of Penteco&s;t, we are told, was this, namely, that "they who gladly received the word, and were baptized, continued &s;tedfa&s;t in the Apo&s;tles doctrine, in fellow&s;hip, in breaking of bread, and in prayer." This is a &s;hort, but withal a full and ble&s;&s;ed account of the fir&s;t truly apo&s;tolic primitive Church; and we may venture to affirm, that as we are more or le&s;s partakers of a true apo&s;tolic primitive &s;pirit, &s;uch kind of religious or fellow&s;hip-meetings, will in propor|tion increa&s;e or decrea&s;e among us. To talk therefore, or write, or preach again&s;t, or either by private per|&s;ua&s;ion or open violence to oppo&s;e or endeavour to &s;up|pre&s;s or di&s;countenance &s;uch kind of religious &s;ocieties,

is flying, as it were, in the very face of the &s;criptures of truth, and of the Holy Gho&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In all our charters granted by the crown, wherein authority is given to bodies corporate to enact laws, it is always with this limitation, namely, that no laws &s;hall be enacted by &s;uch bodies corporate contrary to the laws of the realm. And as the Scriptures are our grand <HI>Codex Legum</HI> and <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> in re&s;pect to our re|ligious principles and practices, what affront mu&s;t we put upon our country in general, and the church of Eng|land in particular, even by barely imagining that any law now exi&s;ts that prohibits any of her members from frequenting &s;uch &s;ocieties as have the divine authority and &s;uper&s;cription &s;o apparently &s;tamped upon them?</P>
<P>The private meetings that are in any wi&s;e deemed and denounced illegal, are &s;uch, and only &s;uch, as are &s;editious, and compo&s;ed of &s;editious per&s;ons, who a&s;&s;o|ciate, indeed under a pretence of religion, but indeed to plot again&s;t the &s;tate. The &s;ooner any that can be con|victed of this are made to for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling them|&s;elves together, the better: and though compo&s;ed of a threefold, three hundred fold, nay a three thou&s;and fold cord, no matter if, like the cords wherewith the Phili&s;|tines bound Sam&s;on, they were immediately broken. But as nothing of this nature can with the lea&s;t &s;hadow of truth be objected again&s;t the meetings and &s;ocieties fre|quented by the&s;e Students, but quite the contrary urged in their favor, if &s;cripture and the practice of the primi|tive Chri&s;tians are to be our guides, they ought not only to be permitted, but countenanced and encouraged by every true lover of our church and nation.</P>
<P>And &s;uppo&s;ing in any &s;uch religious &s;ociety one of them &s;hould venture now and then to drop a word of exhortation, or even attempt in a &s;mall degree to open, expound, or enlarge upon &s;ome practical text of &s;crip|ture, how can even this be looked upon as illegal, much

<P>Our all-wi&s;e Ma&s;ter, we know, &s;ent his Di&s;ciples on &s;hort excur&s;ions, before He gave them the more exten|&s;ive commi&s;&s;ion to go into all the world: and were our Students in general, under proper limitations, to be thus exerci&s;ed and employed, while they are keeping Terms at the Univer&s;ity, or among their poor neighbours in the country, when they return home in time of vaca|tion, they would not turn out &s;uch meer novices, or make &s;uch awkward figures, as too many raw creatures do when they make their fir&s;t appearance in the pulpit. I remember, above thirty years ago, after &s;ome young Students had been vi&s;iting the &s;ick and impri&s;oned, and had been giving a word of exhortation in a private hou&s;e, that upon meeting the Ordinary and Mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h in their return to College, they frankly told him what they had been doing; upon which, he turned to them, and &s;aid, "GOD ble&s;s you: I wi&s;h we had more &s;uch young curates."

altogether incredible. And yet the &s;tanders-by, as well as the &s;uppo&s;ed Culprits them&s;elves, as we are informed, aver this to be real matter of fact: attended with this melancholly aggravation, that they were hi&s;&s;ed at, pu&s;hed about, and treated in a manner that the vile&s;t criminal is not allowed to be treated, either at the Old-Baily, or any Court of ju&s;tice in the kingdom. We are likewi&s;e told, that a copy of their indictment was a&s;ked for, but denied them. And not only &s;o, but that one, from who&s;e politebehaviour in the worldly walk, better things might have been expected, was heard to &s;ay, as he came out of Chapel, to their grand Accu&s;er, after &s;entence of expul&s;ion was pronounced, that he would have the thanks of the whole Univer&s;ity for that day's work.

<L><HI>Et dici potui&s;&s;e, et non potui&s;&s;e refelli.</HI></L></Q>
What thanks, Reverend SIR, he may meet with from the whole Univer&s;ity, I know not: but one thing I know, namely, that he will receive no thanks for that day's work from the "innumerable company of Angels, the general a&s;&s;embly of the Fir&s;t-born, which are writ|ten in Heaven, or from GOD the judge of all, in that day when JESUS, the Mediator of the New Covenant &s;hall come in his own glory, in the glory of the Father, and his holy angels, and gather in his elect from all the four corners of the world."</P>
<P>But, Reverend SIR, may we not pre&s;ume to hope that this voluntary &s;peaker for the whole Univer&s;ity, whoever he be, it maketh no matter to me, was &s;omewhat out and mi&s;taken in his calculation. For it &s;eems not above three or four Doctors, if &s;o many, were pre&s;ent at, at lea&s;t &s;at as judges at this extraordinary tribunal. The worthy Provo&s;t of Queen's, (and undoubtedly many other worthy Heads of Hou&s;es, were, and are like minded) was for pre&s;cribing more lenient methods: and all are glad to hear that the&s;e young Students worthy

But how this worthy Principal, as well as pupils, were treated, is be&s;t known to tho&s;e who had an active hand in all.</P>
<P>However, as the Holy Gho&s;t hath left upon record, to the honour of Nicodemus, that he &s;tood up in de|fence of our LORD before the whole Jewi&s;h Sanhe|drim, and was not con&s;enting to his death, &s;o wherever this act of expul&s;ion is recorded (and recorded it will be, even to late&s;t po&s;terity) it will be mentioned to the honour of Doctor DIXON, (and for acting thus he will have the thanks of all moderate, &s;erious, &s;ober-minded Chri&s;tians in the three kingdoms) that he had no hand in, but did all he po&s;&s;ibly could to prevent the&s;e young mens expul&s;ion. An expul&s;ion for Articles of Impeach|ment to which indeed the accu&s;ed pleaded guilty; but for Articles which (wherever they may be called to mini&s;ter in holy things) will be their te&s;timonial; and their expul&s;ion for holding and confe&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Articles, the &s;tronge&s;t letters of recommendation.</P>
<P>How the&s;e young worthies are now to be di&s;po&s;ed of, or how they will di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves, as it was not &s;o much as hinted that they had the lea&s;t connection with me, is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to inquire. But &s;urely &s;uch an expul&s;ion as this cannot deter them from pur|&s;uing their preparations for their mini&s;terial calling: friends they cannot want, becau&s;e "he is faithful who hath promi&s;ed that who&s;oever for&s;aketh father or mo|ther, hou&s;es or lands, for his &s;ake or the go&s;pel's, he &s;hall have an hundred fold in this life with per&s;ecution, and in the world to come life everla&s;ting."

<P>But what a mercy is it, Reverend SIR, that we live under a free government, under a King who&s;e Royal Grandfather repeatedly declared (and he was as good as his word through a long and glorious reign) that there &s;hould be no Per&s;ecution in his time; and under a King who in his fir&s;t mo&s;t gracious and never-to-be-forgotten Speech from the throne, gave his people the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances "that it was his fixt purpo&s;e, as the be&s;t means to draw down the divine favour on his reign, to countenance and encourage the practice of true Religion and Virtue, and maintain the Toleration inviolable."</P>
<P>That both Students and common People will be in danger of being tempted by &s;uch violent proceedings to put them&s;elves under the act of Toleration, may ea&s;ily be fore&s;een: and it may as ea&s;ily be gue&s;&s;ed how &s;uch treatment will nece&s;&s;arily di&s;courage &s;erious people from &s;ending their &s;ons to the Univer&s;ity of Oxford; and at the &s;ame time furni&s;h them with a new argument for entering their youth in &s;ome of our di&s;|&s;enting Academies, where they will be in no danger, it is pre&s;umed, of being expelled for &s;inging Hymns, &s;peaking a little now and then in a religious Society, or u&s;ing extempore Prayer.</P>

This re&s;olution &s;eems to be taken in order the better to prevent any of the&s;e ca&s;t-outs or any other laymen, however otherwi&s;e well qualified and recommended, from applying to the Society for Holy Orders, that they may be employed and &s;ent abroad as Mi&s;&s;ionaries.

You need not be apprized, Reverend SIR, that a de|&s;ign for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Epi&s;copacy in our I&s;lands and Plantations, hath been long upon the tapis; and that it hath been, in part at lea&s;t, the &s;ubject of annual Sermons for &s;everal years la&s;t pa&s;t.

And, to mention but one more too too recent an example, an Enthu&s;ia&s;m, for being only a little tinc|tured with which Six Students, on March 11th, in the Year of our Lord 1768, were publicly expelled in Edmund Hall chapel.</P>
<P>But think you, Reverend SIR, that this is the way to &s;top the progre&s;s of this Enthu&s;ia&s;m?

Dioce&s;an, be a ju&s;t and proper one, &s;uppo&s;ing at the &s;ame time the Methodi&s;ts are thereby referred to, no matter how &s;oon they are bani&s;hed out of the Univer|&s;ity, and out of the Church al&s;o: for his Lord&s;hip is plea&s;ed to tell us "that they act in direct oppo&s;ition to the perver&s;e Phari&s;ees of old; the&s;e a&s;cribed the works of the Holy Gho&s;t to Beelzebub; and it is no uncommon thing for the&s;e modern Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, adds his Lord&s;hip, to a&s;cribe the works of Beelzebub to the Holy Spirit." Surely his Lord&s;hip, by the&s;e modern Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, can|not mean any who apply for Holy Orders, and profe&s;s before men and angels, that "they are inwardly moved by the Holy Gho&s;t, to take upon them the office and admini&s;tration of the church:" when the &s;earcher of hearts knows that they are moved only by &s;ecular views and worldly hopes of preferment; this is indeed a&s;crib|ing the works of Beelzebub to the Spirit of GOD with a witne&s;s: or, to u&s;e the words of a no le&s;s learned, tho' le&s;s cen&s;orious Prelate, I mean the moderate Bi&s;hop Burnett, "it is a committing the horrid crime of Ana|nias and Saphira over again; it is lying, not only unto man, but unto GOD."</P>
<P>This is a modern kind of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, Reverend SIR, which the true old Methodi&s;ts always did, and I tru&s;t always will abjure, dete&s;t and abhor. If worldly church p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ferments had been their aim, &s;ome of them at lea&s;t might have had worldly ladders enough let down to them to climb up by: but having received a kind of Apo&s;tolical commi&s;&s;ion at their Ordination, when tho&s;e who profe&s;s them&s;elves lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles&punc; &s;aid unto them, "Receive ye the Holy Gho&s;t now com|mitted unto you by the impo&s;ition of our hands:" they would fain keep up and maintain &s;omething of the dig|nity of an apo&s;tolic character; and therefore without ever &s;o much as de&s;igning to enter into any political ca|bals, or civil or church factions what&s;oever, without

turning to the right hand or the left, or troubling the world with &s;o much as one &s;ingle &s;ermon or pamphlet on the bare externals of Religion; they have endeavor|ed to have but one thing in view, namely, to determine to think of nothing, to know nothing, and to preach of nothing but JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified; to &s;pend and be &s;pent for the good of &s;ouls, and to glory in no|thing &s;ave in the cro&s;s of CHRIST, by whom the world is crucified unto them and they unto the world. It is true, by thinking and acting thus, the Methodi&s;ts have been, &amp; it is pre&s;umed always will be, charged and con|demned by men of corrupt minds, as thinking and act|ing irregularly and di&s;orderly: But as &s;uch a charge, in the very nature of the thing, &s;uppo&s;es a deviation from &s;ome &s;ettled &s;tanding rule, they would humbly a&s;k where|in the irregularity and di&s;orderline&s;s of this way of act|ing and thinking doth &s;pecifically con&s;i&s;t? Is it irregular and di&s;orderly to be in&s;tant in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on? Is it irregular and di&s;orderly to do what every Bi&s;hop at the very time of our being ordained Prie&s;ts po&s;itively tells us pertaineth to their office, namely, "to &s;eek after the children of GOD, &s;cattered abroad in this naughty world?" Is it irregular and di&s;orderly after we have e&s;tabli&s;hed the truth of what we deliver in our &s;ermons by &s;cripture proofs further to confirm and illu&s;trate them by repeated and particular quotations, taken from the Liturgy, Articles, and Homilies of our E&s;tabli&s;hed Church? Is it irregular and di&s;orderly to fill her Pews, to crowd her Communion Tables, and to recommend a frequent and con&s;tant devout attendance upon her pub|lic Offices and Services? Or, &s;uppo&s;ing they &s;hould, merely by caprice or prejudice, be denied the privilege of preaching within the Church, can it be ju&s;tly termed irregular or di&s;orderly, at lea&s;t can it po&s;&s;ibly be looked upon as criminal, to preach the &s;ame truths, to make u&s;e of the &s;ame kind of illu&s;trations, to repeat the &s;elf-&s;ame

recommendations without the church walls, in the fields, or any other place what&s;oever?</P>
<P>The late candid Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, I am po&s;itive, did not think &s;uch a way of acting altogether &s;o very crimi|nal; for in the charge given to his Clergy &s;ome years before his tran&s;lation to the See of Sali&s;bury, he told them to this effect, "that they were not to look upon them&s;elves as Mini&s;ters of a Plato, a Pythagoras, or any other heathen Philo&s;opher, con&s;equently they were not to entertain their auditories with mere moral harangues, but that they were to con&s;ider them&s;elves as Mini&s;ters of JESUS CHRIST; and therefore if they would not preach the go&s;pel in the Church, they could not be ju&s;tly angry if the poor people went out to hear it in a field." A charge this truly worthy of a &s;ober minded, moderate, wi&s;e Bi&s;hop of the church of England. For even in acting &s;eemingly thus irregularly and di&s;orderly, the&s;e modern Enthu&s;ia&s;ts only copy after the greate&s;t and brighte&s;t examples the world ever &s;aw, and who&s;e ex|amples it is more than criminal not to follow or copy after. Our ble&s;&s;ed LORD, when denied the u&s;e of the Synagogues, &s;eeing the multitude, went up and cho&s;e a mountain for his pulpit, and the heavens for his found|ing-board. At other times he &s;at by the &s;ea-&s;ide, nay, went into a &s;hip and preached, whil&s;t the whole multi|tude &s;tood on the &s;hore. When Peter and John, that this kind of Enthu&s;ia&s;m might &s;pread no further among the people, were &s;traitly threatned and commanded that they &s;hould thenceforth &s;peak at all to no man in CHRIST's name, they calmly yet boldly replied unto their threat|ners and commanders, "Whether it be right in the &s;ight of God, to hearken unto you, more than unto God, judge ye: For we cannot but &s;peak the things which we have &s;een and heard." A certain woman, named Lydia, a &s;eller of purple, had her heart opened when the great Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles was preaching and praying by a

<P>I believe you will agree, Reverend SIR, that the venerable Fox and Bradford did not appear le&s;s vene|rable for preaching at Paul's cro&s;s; neither did I ever hear that Bi&s;hop Latimer was looked upon as degrading his epi&s;copal character, when he u&s;ed to preach out in Cotten Garden We&s;tmin&s;ter, and King Edward the &s;ixth, that Jo&s;iah of his age, with &s;ome of his court, leaning on velvet cu&s;hions, looked out at the palace window to hear him. And I hereby appeal to the whole Uni|ver&s;ity, whether the Reverend Doctors of Divinity, Heads of Hou&s;es, Graduates or Under-Graduates, ever looked upon it as criminal, or beneath the dignity of their place and &s;tation, to &s;it out in the open air on St. John Bapti&s;t's day, to hear a Ma&s;ter of Arts preach from the &s;tone pulpit in Maudlin College yard; though for fear it may be they &s;hould give further &s;anction to field-preaching, they have lately thought proper to adjourn into the Chapel?</P>

Armed with this panoply divine,
<PB N="30" REF="011117_0029_0F85380586AAD150">
and, as they think, authori&s;ed by the &s;ame LORD, &s;ome few of us continue to this day, among&s;t &s;mall and great, high and low, rich and poor, in Church or Chapel, in commons, &s;treets, fields, when&s;oever or where&s;oever divine Providence opens a door, to te&s;tify repentance towards GOD and faith in our Lord JESUS CHRIST: and this not out of contempt of, or in oppo&s;ition to the godly admonitions of our eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;uperiors, but becau&s;e "the love of CHRIST con&s;traineth us," and we think that a wo, a dreadful wo, awaits us if we preach not the Go&s;pel. Not that we are enemies to a decent or even epi&s;copal con&s;ecration, or &s;etting apart Churches and Chapels for divine and holy wor&s;hip: but we are more indifferent about the reputed outward &s;anctity of places, becau&s;e our LORD, with great &s;o|lemnity, &s;aid unto the woman of Samaria, "Woman, believe me, the hour cometh when ye &s;hall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jeru&s;alem, wor&s;hip the Father: but the hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor|&s;hippers &s;hall wor&s;hip the Father in Spirit and in Truth. Hence we infer, that every place is then, and only then, properly called holy, when, like the ground around the burning bu&s;h, it is made holy by the divine pre&s;ence of Him who &s;pake to Mo&s;es out of the bu&s;h; or like mount Tabor, which by the Apo&s;tle Peter is called by way of empha&s;is, the Holy Mount, becau&s;e him&s;elf and James and John, not only had upon that mount a vi&s;ible outward manife&s;tation, but al&s;o a ble&s;&s;ed inward heart-felt &s;en&s;e of the Redeemer's excellent glory. It was undoubtedly this that made Peter break out into that exclamation: "Ma&s;ter, it is good for us to be here." And it was this that warmed, and not only warmed, but con&s;trained the enraptured Patriarch Jacob, when he had only the ground for his bed, the &s;tones for his pillow, and the open firmament for his curtains and furniture, to break forth into that extatic language

"How dreadful is this place! this is no other than the hou&s;e of GOD; this is the gate of heaven."</P>
<P>If then, Reverend SIR, for this and &s;uch like things we are accounted irregular and di&s;orderly, we are truly &s;orry for it:&mdash;Sorry, but not upon our own accounts, having the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience that we act with a &s;ingle eye, and in direct conformity to the autho|rity of the word of GOD: but we are &s;orry barely on account of our impeachers and condemners, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who being &s;et apart for the mini&s;terial Office, and loaded with eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments, preach very &s;el|dom, or not at all; or, if they do preach now and then, preach only as though they were barely reading wall-lectures, and &s;eldom or ever &s;o much as mention or quote the Homilies of our Church, though they have &s;ub&s;cribed to an Article which &s;ays, that "they contain a godly and whole&s;om doctrine, and which judges them to be read in Churches by the mini&s;ters diligently and di&s;tinctly, that they may be under&s;tood of the people." It is to be feared, that it is owing to &s;uch irregularity and di&s;order as this, that when our people hear of our Articles or Homilies quoted by &s;ome few in the pulpit, that they are ready to cry out, "What new doctrine is this? Thou bringe&s;t certain &s;trange things to our ears:" At lea&s;t if it is not &s;o at home, I am &s;ure it is &s;o abroad. Hence it was that about three years ago, after I had been preaching to a very large auditory in one of the mo&s;t polite places on the Continent of Ame|rica, and in preaching, as is my u&s;ual cu&s;tom, had &s;trongly been recommending the book of Homilies, numbers were &s;tirred up to go to the &s;tores to purcha&s;e them: But upon inquiring after the book of Homilies, the Storekeeper, &s;urprized at the novelty of the word Homilies, begged leave to know what Mu&s;lins they meant, and whether they were not Hummims.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="011117_0031_0F85380B8F648188">
What a pity therefore is it, Reverend SIR, that the book of Homilies, which ought to be in every hand, and as common as our Common Prayer Books, &s;hould never yet have found a place in the large catalogue of books given away by the truly laudable Society for promoting Chri&s;tian Knowledge, though founded &s;oon after the glorious Revolution. If this be not remedied &s;ome way or another, we &s;hall very &s;oon become di&s;|orderly indeed: our Pulpits will &s;till continue to con|tradict our Reading-de&s;ks, and we &s;hall never have the honour of being &s;tiled regular and orderly, till, regard|le&s;s of Sub&s;criptions, Oaths, Rubrics, and Ordination-Offices them&s;elves, our practices give the lie to our profe&s;&s;ions, and we &s;eek the fleece and not the flock, and "preach our&s;elves, and not CHRIST JESUS our LORD."</P>
<P>Dead Formali&s;ts, and proud &s;elf-righteous Bigots, may loudly exclaim and cry out, "the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are we!" They may not only cry out, but al&s;o ca&s;t out; and thinking they thereby do GOD &s;ervice, though mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly deficient in their own moral conduct, may plead con&s;cience, and &s;ay, "Let the Lord be glorified." But to &s;uch as the&s;e our LORD once &s;aid, "Ye are they that ju&s;tify your&s;elves before men, but GOD knoweth your hearts." Like the chief Prie&s;ts, the Scribes and Phari&s;ees of old they may plead their Law; for the breach of which the&s;e irregulars, as they imagine, ought to be condemned and &s;uffer; nay, time may come when they may be permitted to enforce their clamarous accu|&s;ations by urging, as their godly predece&s;&s;ors once did again&s;t our Ma&s;ter, that "we found the&s;e fellows per|verting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute unto Cae&s;ar; but Pilate knew that for envy they delivered Him." And though they could plead their Loyalty, and &s;ay, "If thou let this man go thou art not Cae&s;ar's

Fain would the Methodi&s;ts copy after &s;uch gloriou&s;ly divine examples: and, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, after a trial of near forty years, upon the mo&s;t &s;evere &s;crutiny, their LOYALTY cannot be ju&s;tly &s;o much as once called in que&s;tion; for, as they fear GOD, &s;o they dearly love and honor their King, their rightful Sove|reign King GEORGE; and have been, and continue to be, &s;teady invariable friends to the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of Hanover.

a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad ignorance of human nature, and &s;uch an inexcu&s;able indolence and indifference in the preacher, as mu&s;t con&s;train the hearers, whether they will or not, to &s;u&s;pect that the Preacher, let him be who he will, only deals in the fal&s;e commerce of unfelt truths.</P>
<P>Were our Lawyers, our Coun&s;ellors, or our Players to act thus, both the Bar and the Stage would &s;oon be de&s;erted; and therefore that an&s;wer of Mr. Betterton, to a worthy Prelate, when he a&s;ked him "how it came to pa&s;s that the Clergy, who &s;poke of things real, affected the people &s;o little, and the Players, who &s;poke of things barely imaginary, affected them &s;o much," is worthy of la&s;ting regard. "My Lord, &s;ays Mr. Betterton, I can a&s;&s;ign but one rea&s;on, which is, We Players &s;peak of things imaginary as though they were real, and too many of the Clergy &s;peak of things real as though they were imaginary." Thus it was in his, and all know it is too much the ca&s;e in our time. Hence it is, that even on our mo&s;t important occa&s;ions, the worthy gentlemen concerned in our public charities, generally find them&s;elves more obliged to the Mu&s;icians than the Preachers, for the largene&s;s of their collections: and hence, no doubt it is, that upon our mo&s;t &s;olemn Anniver&s;aries, after long previous notice hath been given, when &s;ome even of our Lords Spiritual preach them&s;elves, perhaps not two Lords temporal come to hear them.</P>
<P>Sorry, am I therefore, Reverend SIR, to inform you, that a celebrated Orator, in one of his Lectures deliver|ed, if I am not mi&s;taken, in the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, takes the liberty of &s;aying, "That it is to be feared this is too much the &s;tate of the Pulpit-elocution in general, in the church of England: On which account, adds he, there never was perhaps a religious &s;ect upon earth who&s;e hearts were &s;o little engaged in the act of public wor&s;hip as the members of that Church. To be

plea&s;ed, we mu&s;t feel, and we are plea&s;ed with feeling. The Pre&s;byterians are moved; the Methodi&s;ts are moved; they go to their meetings and tabernacles with delight; the very Quakers are moved; fanta&s;tical and extravagant as the language of their emotions is, yet &s;till they are moved by it, amd they love their form of wor|&s;hip for that rea&s;on: Whil&s;t much the greater part of the members of the Church of England, are either ba|ni&s;hed from it through di&s;gu&s;t, or reluctantly attend the &s;ervice as a di&s;agreeable duty."&mdash;Thus far Mr. Sheridan.</P>
<P>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> why go I to the Bar or Stage to fetch vouchers in defence of earne&s;tne&s;s in heart and action, when &s;peaking for the mo&s;t high GOD, and offering &s;alvation to pre|cious and immortal &s;ouls, for whom the ever-adorable Mediator &s;hed his precious blood? You know, Reverend SIR, the character given of Bucol&s;pherus one of the re|formers, <HI>Vividus vultus, vividi oculi, vivida manus de|nique omnia vivida.</HI> You have al&s;o heard of a Prophet who was commanded by the Lord God him&s;elf to &s;mite with his hand, and &s;tamp with his foot; and go&s;pel mi|ni&s;ters in general are commanded to "cry aloud, and &s;pare not, and lift up their voices like trumpets." But why refer I even to Reformers or Prophets? Rather let me mention the GOD and Savior of all, even our Lord JESUS CHRIST, on who&s;e manner of preaching the multitudes that followed him, when he came down from the mount made this ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, that "he &s;pake as one having authority, and not as the Scribes." And after his re&s;urrection when "beginning at Mo&s;es and all the Prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning him&s;elf," the two di&s;|ciples at Emmaus &s;aid one to another, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the &s;criptures?" And I believe we may venture to affirm, that if preachers in general &s;pake and opened the &s;criptures more under the

influence and energy of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, whether in con&s;ecrated or uncon&s;ecrated ground, within or without doors, they would find that their hearers hearts in a degree would burn within them too.</P>
<P>But I have done.&mdash;You will be &s;o good, Reverend SIR, as to pardon not only the freedom but prolixity of this. I have already mentioned the motives for writing, and therefore &s;hall now clo&s;e with the advice given upon a &s;imilar occa&s;ion to an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council by Gamaliel, a Doctor of Law, and had in reputation among all the people: "And now I &s;ay unto you, refrain from the&s;e men, and let them alone: for if this council or work be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it: le&s;t haply ye be found to fight again&s;t God." To this God, and the word of his <HI>grace.</HI> I mo&s;t humbly recommend both your&s;elf and the whole Univer&s;ity, and earne&s;tly pray, that all at all times may have a right judgment given them in all things; I beg leave to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>
