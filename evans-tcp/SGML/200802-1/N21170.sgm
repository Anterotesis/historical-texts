<P>IT certainly comes within the compa&s;s of Chri&s;tian Be|nevolence, to &s;hew compa&s;&s;ion to the Animal Creation; and a good mind naturally inclines to do &s;o. But as through an erroneous education, or bad example, many children contract habits of tormenting inferior creatures, before they are con&s;cious of giving them pain; or fall into the contrary fault of immoderate tenderne&s;s to them; it is hoped that an attempt to point out the line of con|duct, which ought to regulate the actions of human be|ings, towards tho&s;e, over whom the <HI>SUPREME GOVER|NOR</HI> hath given them dominion, will not be thought a u&s;ele&s;s undertaking: and that the mode of conveying in|&s;truction on this &s;ubject, which the author of the follow|ing &s;heets has adopted will engage the attention of young minds, and prove in&s;trumental to the happine&s;s of ma|ny an innocent animal.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>MANY young Readers doubtle&s;s remember to have met with a Book, which gives an account of a little boy named Henry, and his &s;i&s;ter Charlotte, who were in|dulged by their Mamma, with walking in the fields and gardens, where &s;he taught them to take particular no|tice of every object that pre&s;ented it&s;elf to their view. The con&s;equence of this was, that they contracted a great fondne&s;s for animals and u&s;ed to expre&s;s a wi&s;h, that their Birds, Cats, Dogs, &amp;c. could talk, that they might hold conver&s;ation with them. Their mamma, therefore to amu&s;e them compo&s;ed the following Fabulous Hi&s;to|ries; in which the &s;entiments and affections of a good Father and Mother, and a Family of Children, are &s;up|po&s;ed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a ne&s;t of Redbrea&s;ts; and others of the feathered race are, by the force of imagination, endued with the &s;ame faculties: but, before Henry and Charlotte began to read the&s;e Hi&s;tories they were taught to con&s;ider them, not as containing the real conver&s;ation of Birds. (for that it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould ever under|&s;tand,) but as a &s;eries of <HI>FABLES,</HI> intended to convey moral in&s;truction applicable to them&s;elves, at the &s;ame time that they excite compa&s;&s;ion and tenderne&s;s for tho&s;e intere&s;ting and delightful creatures, on which &s;uch wan|ton cruelties are frequently inflicted, and recommend <HI>univer&s;al Benevolence.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>IN a hole, which time had made, in a wall covered with ivy, a pair of RED-BREASTS built their ne&s;t. No place could have been better cho&s;en for the pur|po&s;e; it was &s;heltered from the rain, &s;kreened from the wind, and in an orchard belonging to a Gentle|man who had &s;trictly charged his dome&s;tics not to de&s;troy the labours of tho&s;e little &s;ong&s;ters, which cho&s;e his ground as an a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>In this happy retreat, which no idle &s;chool-boy dared to enter, the hen Redbrea&s;t depo&s;ited four eggs, and then took her &s;eat upon them; re&s;olving that nothing &s;hould tempt her to leave the ne&s;t, till &s;he had hatched her infant brood. Her tender mate every morning brought her food, before he ta&s;ted a|ny him&s;elf, and then cheered her with a &s;ong.</P>
<P>At length the day arrived, when the happy mo|ther heard the chirping of her little ones; plea&s;ing to her ears, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">attle of a beloved child, to its fond parent; with inexpre&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s &s;he &s;pread her maternal wings to cover them, threw out the
<PB N="10" REF="027817_0009_0FD64EA6DAF152D8">
egg-&s;hells in which they before lay confined, then pre&s;&s;ed them to her bo&s;om, and pre&s;ented them to her mate, who viewed them with rapture, and &s;eated him&s;elf by her &s;ide, that he might &s;hare her plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>We may promi&s;e our&s;elves much delight in rearing our little family, &s;aid he, but it will occa&s;ion us a great deal of trouble; I would willingly bear the whole fatigue my&s;elf, but it will be impo&s;&s;ible for me with my utmo&s;t labour and indu&s;ty, to &s;upply all our ne&s;tlings with what is &s;ufficient for their daily &s;upport; it will therefore be nece&s;&s;ary for you to leave the ne&s;t occa&s;ionly, in order &s;ometimes to &s;eek provi&s;ions for them. She declared her readine&s;s to take a flight whenever it would be requi&s;ite: and &s;aid, that there would be no nece&s;&s;ity for her to be long ab&s;ent, &s;he had in her la&s;t excur&s;ion di&s;covered a place near the orchard where food was &s;cattered on purpo&s;e for &s;uch birds as would take the pains of &s;eeking it; and had been informed by a Chaffinch, that there was no kind of danger in picking it up. This is a lucky di&s;covery indeed, replied he, and we mu&s;t avail our&s;elves of it; for this great increa&s;e of family renders it prudent to make u&s;e of every expe|dient for &s;upplying our nece&s;&s;ities! I my&s;elf, mu&s;t take a large circuit, for &s;ome in&s;ects that are proper for the ne&s;tlings cannot be found in all places: how|ever, I will bear you compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y whenever it is in my power. The little ones now began to feel the &s;en|&s;ation
<PB N="11" REF="027817_0010_0FD64EA935AE5328">
of hunger, and opening their gaping mouths for food; on which their kind father in&s;tantly fled forth to &s;eek it for them, and in turns &s;upplied them all, as well as his beloved mate. This was a hard day's work, and when evening came on, he was glad to &s;eek repo&s;e; therefore, turning his head under his wing, he &s;oon fell a&s;leep; his mate fol|lowed his example; the four little ones had before fallen into a gentle &s;lumber, and perfect quietne&s;s for &s;ome hours reigned in the ne&s;t.</P>
<P>The next morning they were awakened at the dawn of day, by the &s;ong of &s;kylark, who had a ne&s;t near the orchard; and as the young Redbrea&s;ts were clamorous for food, their father cheerfully prepared him&s;elf to renew his toil, but fir&s;t reque&s;ted his mate to accompany him to the place &s;he had mentioned. That I will do, replied &s;he, at a proper hour, but it is too early yet; I mu&s;t, therefore, entreat that you will go by your&s;elf, and procure a breakfa&s;t for us, as I am fearful of leaving the ne&s;tlings before the air is warmer, le&s;t they &s;hould be chilled. To this he readily con&s;ented, and fed all his little darlings, to whom for the &s;ake of di&s;tinction, I &s;hall give the names of Robin, Dicky, Flap&s;y, and Peck&s;y. When this kind of office was performed, he perched on an
<PB N="12" REF="027817_0011_0FD64EAA9DD57F38">
adjacent tree, and there, while he re&s;ted, entertained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ily with his melody, till his mate &s;pringing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the ne&s;t, called on him to attend her; on which he in&s;tantly took wing, and followed her to a court|yard, belonging to an elegant man&s;ion.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner did they appear before the parlour win|dow than it was ha&s;tily thrown up by Mi&s;s Harriet Ben&s;on, a little girl about eleven years old, the daughter of the Gentleman and Lady to whom the hou&s;e belonged.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Harriot with great delight, called her bro|ther to &s;ee two Robin Redbrea&s;ts: Her &s;ummons was in&s;tantly complied with, and &s;he was joined by Ma&s;ter Frederick, a fine chubby ro&s;y-cheek boy, about &s;ix years of age, who as &s;oon as he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aken a peep at the feathered &s;trangers, ran to his mamma, and entreated her to give him &s;omething to feed the birds with. I mu&s;t have a great piece of bread this morning &s;aid he, for there are all the Sparrows and Chaffinches that come every day, and two Robin Redbrea&s;ts be&s;ides. Here is a piece for you, Fre|derick replied Mrs. Ben&s;on, cutting a roll that was on the table; but if your daily pen&s;ioners continue to increa&s;e, as they have done lately, we mu&s;t provide &s;ome other food for them, as it is not right to cut
<PB N="13" REF="027817_0012_0FD64DF6A3DC7F08">
pieces from a leaf on purpo&s;e for birds, becau&s;e there are many children that want bread to whom we &s;hould give the preference. Would you deprive a poor lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le hungry boy of his breakfa&s;t, to give it to birds? No, &s;aid Frederick, I would &s;ooner give up my own breakfa&s;t to a poor boy, than he &s;hould go without. But where &s;hall I get victuals enough for my birds? I will beg the cook to &s;ave all the crumbs in the bread pan, and de&s;ire John to pre&s;erve all he makes, when he cuts the loaf for dinner, and tho&s;e which are &s;cattered on the table-cloth. A very good &s;che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, and I advi&s;e you, my dear, to put it in execution; for I make no doubt it will an&s;wer your purpo&s;e if you can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vail on the &s;ervants to indulge you. I cannot bear to &s;ee the lea&s;t fragment of food wa&s;ted, which may conduce to the &s;upport of life in any creature?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Harriet being quite impatient to exerci&s;e her benevolence, reque&s;ted her brother to remember that the poor birds, for whom he had been a &s;ucce&s;sful &s;olicitor, would &s;oon fly away, if he did not make ha&s;te to feed them; on which he ran to the window with his trea&s;ure in his hand.</P>
<P>When Mi&s;s Harriet fir&s;t appeared, the winged &s;up|pliants approached with eager expectation of the
<PB N="14" REF="027817_0013_0FD64DD1294F8FC0">
daily handful, which their kind benefactre&s;s made it a cu&s;tom to di&s;tribute, and were &s;upprized at the de|lay of her charity. They hopped around the win|dow &mdash;they chirped&mdash;they twittered, and employed all their little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arts to gain attention; and were on the point of departing, when Ma&s;ter Frederick, breaking a bit from the piece he held in his hand, at|tempted to &s;catter it among&s;t them, calling out at the &s;ame time, Dicky! Dicky! On hearing the well|known &s;ound of invitation, the little flock immedi|ately drew near&mdash;Ma&s;ter Frederick held a &s;hort conte&s;t with his &s;i&s;ter, in order to prevail with her to let him feed all the birds him&s;elf; but finding that he could not fling the crums far enough for the Redbrea&s;ts, who with the timidity of Strangers, kept at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;tance, he re&s;igned the ta&s;k, and Mi&s;s Harriet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> dextrous hand, threw &s;ome of them to the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot where the affectionate pair &s;tood, waiting for an opportunity of attracting her no|tice, and with grateful hearts picked up the portion a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igned them, and in the mean while, the other birds having &s;atisfied their hunger, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively with|drew, and they were left alone. Ma&s;ter Frederick exclaimed with rapture, that the two Robin Red|brea&s;ts were feeding! and Mi&s;s Harriet meditated a de&s;ign of taming them, by repeated in&s;tances of kind|ne&s;s. Be &s;ure, my dear brother, &s;aid &s;he not to for|get to a&s;k the cook and John for the crumbs; and do not let the lea&s;t little mor&s;el of any thing you have
<PB N="15" REF="027817_0014_0FD64DD39B8614E0">
to eat, fall to the ground. I will be careful in re&s;pect to mine, and we will collect all that pappa and mamm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> crumble; and if we cannot by the&s;e means get enough, I will &s;pend &s;ome of my money in feed for them.&mdash;O, &s;aid Frederick, I would give all the money I have in the world to buy victuals for my dear, dear birds. Hold, my love, &s;aid Mrs. Ben|&s;on, though I commend your humanity, I mu&s;t re|mind you again, that there are poor people as well as poor birds. Well, mamma, replied Frederick, I will only buy a little &s;eed then. As he &s;pake the la&s;t words, the Redbrea&s;ts having fini&s;hed their meal, the mother bird expre&s;&s;ed her impatience to return to the ne&s;t; and having obtained her mate's con&s;ent, repaired with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to her humble habitation, whil&s;t he tuned his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elodious pipe, and delighted their young benefactors with his mu&s;ic; he then &s;oared into the air, and took his flight to an adjoining garden, where he had a great chance of finding worms for his family.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>MASTER BENSON expre&s;&s;ed great concern that the Robins were gone; but was comforted by his &s;i&s;ter, who reminded him, that in all probability his new favourites having met with &s;o kind a re|ception,
<PB N="16" REF="027817_0015_0FD64DD71E9BD890">
would return on the morrow. Mrs. Ben|&s;on then bid them &s;hut the window, and taking Frederick in her lap, and de&s;iring Mi&s;s Harriet to &s;it down by her, thus addre&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>I am delighted, my dear children, with your hu|mane behaviour towards the animal creation, and wi&s;h by all means to encourage it. But though a mo&s;t commendable propen&s;ity, it requires regulati|on; let me therefore recommend to you, not to &s;uffer it to gain upon you to &s;uch a degree, as to make you unhappy or forgetful of tho&s;e, who have a &s;uperior claim to your attention: I mean poor people; al|ways keep in mind the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which they endure, and on no account wa&s;te any kind of food, nor give to inferior animals what is de&s;igned for mankind.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iet promi&s;ed to follow her mamma's in&s;tructions; but Frederick's attention was entirely engaged by watching a Butterfly, which had ju&s;t left the chry&s;alis, and was fluttering in the window, longing to try its wings in the air and &s;un-&s;hine. This Frederick was very de&s;irous of catching, but his mamma would not permit him to attempt it; be|cau&s;e (&s;he told him) he could not well lay hold of its wings without doing it an injury, and it would be much happier at liberty. Should you like, Fre|derick. &s;aid &s;he, when you are going out to play, to have any body lay hold on you violently, &s;cratch you all over, then offer you &s;omething to eat which is very di&s;agreeable, and perhaps poi&s;onous, and
<PB N="17" REF="027817_0016_0FD64DD9A1C1CCC8">
then &s;hut you up in a little dark room? And yet this is the fate to which many an harmle&s;s in&s;ect is con|demned by thoughtle&s;s children. As &s;oon as Frede|rick under&s;tood that he could not catch the butterfly without hurting it, he gave up the point, and a&s;&s;u|red his mamma, he did not want to keep it, but on|ly to carry it out of doors. Well, replied &s;he, that end may be an&s;wered by opening the window which at her de&s;ire was done by Mi&s;s Harriet; the happy in&s;ect &s;eized the opportunity of e&s;caping, and Fre|derick had &s;oon the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing it on a ro&s;e-tree.</P>
<P>Breakfa&s;t being ended, Mrs. Ben&s;on reminded the young lady and gentleman, that it was almo&s;t time for their le&s;&s;ons to begin; but de&s;ired their maid to take them into the garden before the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> applied to bu&s;ine&s;s, whil&s;t &s;he gave &s;ome direction in the fami|ly; and Ma&s;ter Frederick, during his walk, amu&s;ed him&s;elf with watching the Butterfly, as it flew from flower to flower which gave more plea&s;ure than he could po&s;&s;ibly have received from catching and con|fining the little tender creature.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee what became of our Redbrea&s;ts, after they left their young benefactors. The hen as I informed you, repaired immediately to the ne&s;t; her heart fluttered with apprehen&s;ion as &s;he entered it, and &s;he eagerly called out, "are you all &s;afe, my little dears?" All &s;afe, my good mo|ther,
<PB N="18" REF="027817_0017_0FD64DDB5E9B8E58">
replied Peck&s;y, but a little hungry, and very cold. Well, &s;aid &s;he, your la&s;t complaint I can &s;oon remove; but in re&s;pect to &s;atisfying your hunger, that mu&s;t be your father's ta&s;k, for I have not been able to bring any thing good for you to eat; how|ever he will &s;oon be here, I make no doubt. Then &s;preading her wings over them all, &s;he &s;oon commu|nicated warmth to them, and they were again com|fortable. In a very &s;hort time her mate returned, for he only &s;taid at Mr. Ben&s;on's to fini&s;h his &s;ong, and refre&s;h him&s;elf with &s;ome clear water, which his new friends always kept in the place where they fed the birds, on purpo&s;e for their little pen&s;ioners. He brought in his mouth a worm, which was given to Robin; and was going to fetch one for Dicky, but that his mate reminded him of their agreement&punc; to divide betwixt them the care of providing for the family. My young ones are now hatched, &s;aid &s;he, and you can keep them warm as well as my&s;elf; take my place therefore and the next excur&s;ion &s;hall be mine. I con&s;ent, an&s;wered he, with the more plea&s;ure, becau&s;e I think a little flying now and then will do you good; but to &s;ave you the trouble of a painful &s;earch, I can direct you to a &s;pot, where you may be certain of finding worms enough for this morning's &s;upply. He then de&s;cribed the place; and immediately on her quitting the ne&s;t entered it, and gathered his young ones under his wings.&mdash;
<PB N="19" REF="027817_0018_0FD64DDF8A42C908">
Come, my dears, &s;aid he, let us &s;ee what kind of a nur&s;e I can make: but an aukward one, I fear; even every mother bird is not a good nur&s;e; but you are very fortunate in your's, for &s;he is an exceeding tender one, and I hope you will make her a dutiful return for her kindne&s;s. They all promi&s;ed him they would: well, then, &s;aid he, I will &s;ing you a &s;ong. He did &s;o, and it was a very merry one, and delight|ed the ne&s;tlings extremely: &s;o that though they lay a little inconveniently under his wings, they did not regard it, nor think the time of their mother's ab|&s;ence long; &s;he had not &s;ucceeded in the place &s;he fir&s;t went to, as a boy was picking up worms to an|gle with, of whom &s;he was afraid, and therefore flew farther: but as &s;oon as &s;he obtained what &s;he went for, &s;he returned with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed; and notwith&s;tanding &s;he had repeated invitations from &s;everal gay birds which &s;he met, to join their &s;por|tive parties, &s;he kept a &s;teady cour&s;e, preferring the plea&s;ure of feeding little Dicky, to all the diver&s;ions of the fields and groves. As &s;oon as &s;he came near the ne&s;t her mate &s;tarted up to make room for her, and take his turn of providing for his family. Once more adieu! &s;aid he, and was out of &s;ight in an in|&s;tant.</P>
<P>Well, my ne&s;tlings, &s;aid the mother, how do you do? Very well, thank you, replied all at once; and we have been very merry, &s;aid Robin, for my father

<P>IT happened one day, that both the Redbrea&s;ts, who always went together to Mr. Ben&s;on's (be|cau&s;e if one had waited for the other's return, it would have mi&s;&s;ed the chance of being fed) it hap|pened, I &s;ay, that they were both ab&s;ent longer than u&s;ual, for their little benefactors having been fatigued with a very long walk the evening before, lay late in bed that morning; but as &s;oon as Frederick was dre&s;&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter, who was waiting for him, took him by the hand, and led him down &s;tairs, where he ha&s;|tily demanded of the cook the collection of crumbs re|&s;erved for him. As &s;oon as he entered the breakfa&s;t parlour, he ran eagerly to the window, and at|tempted to fling it up. What is the cau&s;e of this mighty bu&s;tle? &s;aid his mamma. Do you not per|ceive that I am in the room, Frederick? Oh, my

We were &s;o tired la&s;t night, an&s;wered Mi&s;s Ben&s;on, that we over&s;lept our&s;elves, mamma. This excu&s;e may &s;atisfy you and your brother, added the Lady, but I fear your birds would bring heavy complaints again&s;t you were they able to talk our language. But make ha&s;te to &s;upply their pre&s;ent wants; and for the future, whenever you give any living crea|ture cau&s;e to depend on you for &s;u&s;tenance, be care|ful on no account to di&s;appoint it; and if you are prevented feeding it your&s;elf, employ another per&s;on to do it for you. But though it is very commenda|ble, and indeed an obligation to our humanity, to be attentive to your dependants, yet you mu&s;t not let this make you forgetful of your duty to your friend. It is cu&s;tomary for little boys and girls to pay their re&s;pects to their papa's and mamma's every morning, as &s;oon as they &s;ee them. This, Fre|derick, you ought to have done to me, on entering the parlour, in&s;tead of tearing acro&s;s it, crying out my birds! my birds! it would have taken you but a very little time to have done &s;o: however, I will excu&s;e your neglect now, my dear, as you did not

You depend as much on your papa and me, for every thing you want, as the&s;e little birds do on you: nay more &s;o, for they could &s;upply their own wants, by &s;eeking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ood in other p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but children can do nothing towards their &s;upport: therefore it is particularly requi&s;ite, that they would be dutiful and re&s;pectful to tho&s;e, who&s;e tenderne&s;s and care are con&s;tantly exerted for their bene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>And you &s;et your foot very hard upon me, cried Peck&s;y, for telling you that you had forgot your dear mother's injunction.</P>
<P>This is a &s;ad &s;tory indeed, &s;aid the mother. I am very &s;orry to find, Robin, that you already di&s;cover &s;uch a turbulent di&s;po&s;ition.

Robin, greatly mortified, retired from his mother; on which Dicky, with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s, began to intercede for him.

At this in&s;tant her mate returned with a fine worm, and looked as u&s;ual for Robin, who lay &s;kulking by him&s;elf. Give it, &s;aid the mother, to Dicky, Robin mu&s;t be &s;erved la&s;t this morning; nay, I do not know whe|ther I &s;hall permit him to have any victuals all day. Dicky was very unwilling to mortify his brother, but on his mother's commanding him not to detain his father, he opened his mouth and &s;wallowed the delicious mouthful. What can be the matter, &s;aid the good father, when he had emptied his mouth &s;urely none of the little ones have been naughty? But I cannot &s;top to enquire at pre&s;ent, for I left another fine worm which may be gone if I do not make ha&s;te back.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he departed, Dicky renewed his &s;olici|tations that Robin might be forgiven; but as he &s;at &s;welling with anger and di&s;dain, becau&s;e he fancied that the elde&s;t &s;hould not be &s;hoved to the out&s;ide of his mother's wing, whil&s;t the others were fed, &s;he would not hear a word in his behalf.

If that is the ca&s;e, replied the father, leave me to &s;ettle this bu&s;ine&s;s, my dear, and pray go into the air a little, for you &s;eem to be &s;adly agitated.

<P>As &s;oon as the mother departed, the father thus addre&s;&s;ed the delinquent. And &s;o, Robin, you want to be ma&s;ter of the ne&s;t?

I can &s;ay nothing in re&s;pect to the la&s;t particular, replied the father, that depends upon his mother; but as it is his fir&s;t offence, and he &s;eems to be very &s;orry, I will my&s;elf pardon it, and intercede for him with his mother, who I fear is at this time la|menting his obdur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> On this he left the ne&s;t to &s;eek for her.

I fly to give it him &s;aid &s;he, and ha&s;tened into the ne&s;t. In the mean while Robin wi&s;hed for, yet dreaded her return.

<P>A FEW days after, a fre&s;h di&s;turbance took place. All the little Redbrea&s;ts, excepting Peck&s;y, in turn committed &s;ome fault or other, for which they were occa&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y puni&s;hed; but &s;he was of &s;o amiable a di&s;po&s;ition, that it was her con&s;tant &s;tudy to act with propriety, and avoid giving offence; on which account &s;he was ju&s;tly care&s;&s;ed by her parents with a greater degree of kindne&s;s.

<P>Robin, Dicky, and Flap&s;y, were quite confounded at their mother's &s;urprizing them in the mid&s;t of their naughty behaviour, and Peck&s;y felt an affecti|onate concern that they had incurred the di&s;plea|&s;ure of &s;o tender a parent; and far from increa&s;ing it by complaining of them, endeavoured to &s;often her anger. That I have been vexed, my dear mo|ther, &s;aid &s;he, is true, but no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;o great a degree as you &s;uppo&s;e; and I am rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to believe that my dear brothers and &s;i&s;ter were not in earne&s;t in the &s;evere things they &s;aid of me.&mdash;Perhaps they only
<PB N="33" REF="027817_0032_0FD64DFCAF007880">
meant to try my affections.&mdash;To &s;pare them the trouble of any future trial, I now entreat them to believe my a&s;&s;urances, that I would willingly re&s;ign the greate&s;t plea&s;ure in life, could I by that means increa&s;e their happine&s;s; and &s;o far from wi&s;hing for the <HI>nice&s;t mor&s;el,</HI> I would content my&s;elf with the humble&s;t fare, rather than any of them &s;hould be di&s;appointed. This tender &s;peech had its de&s;ired effect; it recalled tho&s;e &s;entiments of love, which envy and jealou&s;y had for a time bani&s;hed; each ne&s;tling acknowledged its fault, and having obtain|ed the forgivene&s;s of their mother, a perfect recon|ciliation too place, to the great joy of Peck&s;y, and indeed of all parties.</P>
<P>All the ne&s;tlings continued very good for &s;everal days, and no occurrence happened worth relating: the little flock were &s;oon covered with feathers, which their mother taught them to dre&s;s, telling them, that neatne&s;s was a very e&s;&s;ential thing being conducive to health, and al&s;o to render them agreea|ble in the eye of the world.</P>
<P>Robin was a very &s;trong robu&s;t bird, not remarka|ble for his beauty, but there was a great bri&s;kne&s;s in his manner, which covered many defects, and he was very likely to attract notice. His father judg|ed from the tone of his chirpings, that he would be a very good &s;ong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Dicky had a remarkable fine plumage, his brea&s;t was of a beautiful red, his body and wings of an ele|gant
<PB N="34" REF="027817_0033_0FD64DFEA59C1CE0">
mottled brown, and his eyes &s;parkled like dia|monds.</P>
<P>Flap&s;y was al&s;o very pretty, but more di&s;tingui&s;h|ed for the elegance of her &s;hape, than for the variety and lu&s;ture of her feathers.</P>
<P>Peck&s;y had no outward charms to recommend her to notice; but the&s;e defects were amply &s;upplyed by the &s;weetne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, which was ami|able to the greate&s;t degree. Her temper was con|&s;tantly &s;erene, &s;he was ever attentive to the happi|ne&s;s of her parents, and would not have grieved them for the world, and her affection for her bro|thers and &s;i&s;ter was &s;o great, that &s;he con&s;tantly pre|ferred their intere&s;t to her own, of which we lately gave an in&s;tance.</P>
<P>The kind parents attended to them with unremit|ting affection, and made their daily vi&s;it to Ma&s;ter Mi&s;s Ben&s;on, who very punctually di&s;charged the benevolent office of feeding them. The Robin Red|brea&s;ts, familiarized by repeated favours, approach|ed nearer and nearer to their little friends by de|grees, and at length ventured to enter the room and feed upon the breakfa&s;t-table. Mi&s;s Harriet was delighted at this circum&s;tance, and Frederick was quite tran&s;ported; he longed to catch the birds, but his mamma told him, that would be the very means to drive them away. Mi&s;s Harriet entreated him not to frighten them on any account, and he was prevailed on to forbear; but could not help expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h
<PB N="35" REF="027817_0034_0FD64DFFA7213640">
that he had them in a cage, that he might feed them all day long.</P>
<P>And do you really think, Frederick, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, that the&s;e little delicate creatures are &s;uch gluttons, as to de&s;ire to be fed all day long? Could you tempt them to do it, they would &s;oon die; but they know better, and as &s;oon as their appetites are &s;atisfied, always leave of eating. Many a little boy may learn a le&s;&s;on from them. Do not you recollect one of your acquaintance, who, if an apple-pie, or any thing el&s;e that he calls nice, is &s;et before him, will eat till he makes him&s;elf &s;ick? Frederick look|ed a&s;hamed, being con&s;cious that he was too much inclined to indulge his love of delicacies. Well, &s;aid his mamma, I &s;ee you under&s;tand who I mean, Frederick, &s;o we will &s;ay no more on that &s;ubject; only when you meet with that little Gentleman, give my love to him, and tell him I beg he will be as moderate as his Redbrea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The cock bird having fini&s;hed his breakfa&s;t, flew out at the window, followed by his mate; and as &s;oon as they were out of &s;ight, Mrs. Ben&s;on continu|ed her di&s;cour&s;e. And would you really confine the&s;e &s;weet creatures in a cage, Frederick, merely to have the plea&s;ure of looking at them? Should you like to be always &s;hut up in a little room, and think it &s;ufficient if you were &s;upplied with victuals and drink? Is there no enjoyment in running about, jumping, and going from place to place? Do not
<PB N="36" REF="027817_0035_0FD64E014E120918">
you like to a&s;&s;ociate with little boys and girls? And is there no plea&s;ure in breathing the fre&s;h air? Though the&s;e little animals are inferior to you, there is no doubt but they are capable of enjoy|ments &s;imilar to the&s;e; and it mu&s;t be a dreadful life for a poor bird to be &s;hut up in a cage, where he cannot &s;o much as make u&s;e of his wings&mdash;where he is excluded from his natural companions&mdash;and where he cannot po&s;&s;ibly receive that refre&s;hment, which the air mu&s;t afford to him when at liberty to &s;oar to &s;uch a heigth. But this is not all, for many a poor bird is caught and &s;eperated from its family, af|ter it has been at the trouble of building a ne&s;t&mdash;has perhaps laid its eggs&mdash;or even hatched its young ones, which are by this means expo&s;ed to inevitable de|&s;truction. It is likely that the&s;e very Redbrea&s;ts may have young ones, for this is the &s;ea&s;on of the year for their hatching; and I rather think they have, from the circum&s;tance of their always coming toge|ther. If this is the ca&s;e, &s;aid Mi&s;s Harriet, it would be a pitty indeed to confine them. But why, mamma if it wrong to catch birds, did you at one time keep Canaries,? The ca&s;e is very different in re&s;pect to Canaries, my dear, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on. By keeping them in a cage, I do them a kindne&s;s. I con&s;ider them as little foreigners who claim my ho&s;pitality. This kind of bird came originally from a warm cli|mate, they are in their nature very &s;u&s;ceptible of cold and would peri&s;h in the open air in our win|ters:
<PB N="37" REF="027817_0036_0FD64E029B1ABC68">
neither does the food which they feed on grew plentifully in this country; and as they are always here bred in cages, they do not know how to pro|cure the materials for the ne&s;ts abroad. And there is another particular which would greatly di&s;tre&s;s them were they to be turned loo&s;e, which is, the ridicule and contempt they would be expo&s;ed to from other birds. I remember once to have &s;een a poor Canary, which had been turned loo&s;e becau&s;e it could not &s;ing; and &s;urely no creature could be more mi&s;erable. It was &s;tarving for want of victu|als, fami&s;hing with thir&s;t, &s;hivering with cold, and looked terrified to the greate&s;t degree; whil&s;t a par|cel of Sparrows and Chaffinches pur&s;ued it from place to place, twittering and chirping with every mark of in&s;olence and deri&s;ion. I could not help fancying the little creature to be like a foreigner ju&s;t landed from &s;ome di&s;tant country, followed by a rude rabble of boys, who were ridiculing him be|cau&s;e his dre&s;s and language were &s;trange to them.</P>
<P>And what became of the poor little creature, mamma? &s;aid Mi&s;s Harriet. I was going to tell you, my dear, replied Mrs. Ben&s;on. I ordered the &s;er|vant to bring me a cage, with &s;eed and water in their u&s;ual places; this I cau&s;ed to be hung on a tree, next to that in which the little &s;ufferer in vain en|deavoured to hide him&s;elf among the leaves from his cruel pur&s;uers. No &s;ooner did the &s;ervant retire,
<PB N="38" REF="027817_0037_0FD64E066C56AD70">
than the poor little wretch flew to it. I immediate|ly had the cage brought into the parlour, where I experienced great plea&s;ure in ob&s;erving what hap|pine&s;s the poor creature enjoyed in her deliverance. I kept it &s;ome years, but not chu&s;ing to confine her in a <HI>little</HI> cage, had a <HI>large</HI> one bought, and procured a companion for her of her own &s;pecies. I &s;upplied them with materials for building, and from them proceeded a little colony, which grew &s;o numerous, that you know I gave them to Mr. F. to put in his aviary, where you have &s;een them enjoying them|&s;elves. So now I hope I have fully accounted for hav|ing kept Canary birds in a cage. You have indeed, mamma, &s;aid Harriet. I have al&s;o, &s;aid Mrs. Ben|&s;on, occa&s;ionally kept Larks. In &s;evere winters va&s;t numbers of them come to this country from a colder climate, and many peri&s;h. Quantities of them are killed and &s;old for the &s;pit, and the bird-catch|ers u&s;ually have a great many to &s;ell, and many an idle boy has &s;ome to di&s;po&s;e of. I frequently buy them, as you know, Harriet, but as &s;oon as the fine weather returns, I con&s;tantly &s;et them at liberty. But come, my dears, prepare for your morning walk, and afterwards let me &s;ee you in my dre&s;&s;ing-room.</P>
<P>I wonder, &s;aid Frederick, whether our Redbrea&s;ts have got a ne&s;t? I will watch to-morrow which way they fly, for I &s;hould like to &s;ee the little ones. And what will you do &s;hould you find them out? &s;aid his mamma. Not take the ne&s;t, I hope? Why,
<PB N="39" REF="027817_0038_0FD64E067118B5D8">
replied Frederick, I &s;hould like to bring it home, mamma, and put it in a tree near the hou&s;e, and then I would &s;catter crumbs for the old ones to feed them with. Your de&s;ign is a kind one, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, but would greatly di&s;tre&s;s your little fa|vourites. Many birds, through fear for&s;ake their ne&s;ts, when they are removed, therefore I de&s;ire you to let them alone if you &s;hould chance to find them. Mi&s;s Harriet then remarked, that &s;he thought it very cruel to take birds ne&s;ts. Ah! my dear, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, tho&s;e who commit &s;uch barbarous actions, are quite in&s;en&s;ible to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es they occa&s;ion. It is very true, that we ought not to indulge &s;o great a degree of pity and tenderne&s;s for &s;uch animals, as for tho&s;e who are more properly our fellow-creatures; I mean men women and children; but as every liv|ing creature can feel, we &s;hould have a con&s;tant re|gard to tho&s;e feelings, and &s;trive to give happine&s;s, rather than inflict mi&s;ery. But go, my dear, and take your walk. Mrs. Ben&s;on then left them, to attend her u&s;ual morning employments; and the young Lady and Gentleman, attended by their maid, pa&s;&s;ed an agreeable half hour in the garden.</P>

<P>IN the mean time, the hen Redbrea&s;t returned to the ne&s;t, whil&s;t her mate took his flight in &s;earch of food for his family When the mother approached the ne&s;t, &s;he was &s;urprized at not hearing as u&s;ual the chirping of her young ones; and what was her a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;eeing them all crouded together, trembling with apprehen&s;ion! What is the matter, my ne&s;tlings, &s;aid &s;he, that I find you in this ter|ror? &mdash;Oh, my dear mother! &s;aid Robin, who fir&s;t ventured to rai&s;e up his head, is it you? Peck&s;y then revived, and entreated her mother to come into the ne&s;t, which &s;he did without delay, and the little tremblers crept under her wings, endeavouring to conceal them&s;elves in this happy retreat. What has terrified you in his manner? &s;aid &s;he. Oh! I do not know, replied Dicky, but we have &s;een &s;uch a mon&s;ter as I never beheld before. A mon&s;ter, my dear? pray de&s;cribe it. I cannot, &s;aid Dicky, it was too frightful to be de&s;cribed. Frightful, indeed, cried Robin, but I had a full view of it, and will give the be&s;t de&s;cription I can. We were all lying peacea|bly in the ne&s;t, and very happy together; I and Dicky were trying to &s;ing, when &s;uddenly we heard a noi&s;e again&s;t the wall, and pre&s;ently a great round red face appeared before the ne&s;t, with a pair of enor|mous
<PB N="41" REF="027817_0040_0FD64E0CB45333E0">
&s;taring eyes, a very large beak, and below that a wide mouth, with two rows of bones, that looked as if they could grind us all to pieces in an in&s;tant. About the top of this round face, and down the &s;ides, hung &s;omething black, but not like fea|thers. When the two &s;taring eyes had looked at us for &s;ome time, the whole thing di&s;appeared. I can|not at all conceive, from your de&s;cription, Robin, what this thing could be, &s;aid the mother, but per|haps it may come again. Oh! I hope not, cried Flap&s;y, I &s;hall die with fear if it does. Why &s;o, my love? &s;aid her mother, has it done you any harm? I cannot &s;ay it has, replied Flap&s;y. Well then, you do very wrong, my dear, in giving way to &s;uch ap|prehen&s;ions. You mu&s;t &s;trive to get the better of that fearful di&s;po&s;ition. When you go abroad in the world, you will &s;ee many &s;trange objects; and if you are terrified at every appearance which you cannot account for, you will live a mo&s;t unhappy life. Endea|vour to be good, and then you need not fear anything. But here comes your father, perhaps he will explain the appearance which has &s;o alarmed you to-day. As &s;oon as the father had given the worm to Robin, he was preparing to depart for another, but to his &s;urprize, all the re&s;t of the ne&s;tlings begged him to &s;tay, declaring that they had rather go without their meal, on condition he would but remain at

home and take care of them. Stay at home and take care of you! &s;aid he. Why is that more ne|ce&s;&s;ary now than u&s;ual? The mother then related the &s;trange occurrence that had occa&s;ioned this re|que&s;t. Non&s;en&s;e, &s;aid he&mdash;a mon&s;ter!&mdash;large mouth! &mdash;long beak!&mdash;I don't under&s;tand &s;uch &s;tuff.&mdash; Be&s;ides, as it did them no harm, why are they to be in &s;uch terror now it is gone? Don't be angry, dear father, &s;aid Peck&s;y, for it was very frightful indeed. Well, &s;aid he, I will fly all round the orchard, and perhaps may meet this mon&s;ter. Oh! it will eat you up! it will eat you up! &s;aid Flap&s;y. Never fear, &s;aid he, and away he flew. The mother then again attempted to calm them, but all in vain, their fears were now redoubled by apprehen&s;ions for their fa|ther's &s;afety; however, he &s;oon returned. Well, &s;aid he, I have &s;een this mon&s;ter; the little ones then clung to their mother, fearing the dreadful creature was ju&s;t at hand. What, afraid again! cried he; a parcel of &s;tout hearts I have in my ne&s;t truly! Why, when you fly about in the world you will, in all probability, &s;ee hundreds of &s;uch mon&s;ters, (as you call them) unle&s;s you chu&s;e to confine your|&s;elves to a retired life; nay, even in woods and groves you will be liable to meet &s;ome of them, and tho&s;e of the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous kind. I begin to com|prehend &s;aid the mother, that the&s;e dear ne&s;tlings have &s;een the face of a man. Even &s;o, replied her

And does he live in this garden? &s;aid Flap&s;y. He works here very often, replied her father, but is frequently ab&s;ent. O then, cried &s;he, pray take us abroad when he is away, for indeed I cannot bear to &s;ee him. You are a little &s;impleton, &s;aid the father; and if you do not endeavour to get more re&s;olution, I will leave you in the ne&s;t by your&s;elf, when I am teaching your brothers and &s;i&s;ters to fly and peck, and what will you do then? for you mu&s;t not expect we will go from them to bring you food. Flap&s;y, fearful that her father would be quite an|gry, promi&s;ed to follow his directions in every re&s;|pect, and the re&s;t animated by his di&s;cour&s;e, began to recover their &s;pirits.</P>

<P>WHILST the&s;e terrible commotions pa&s;&s;ed in the ne&s;t, the <HI>mon&s;ter,</HI> who was no other than hone&s;t Joe the gardener went to the hou&s;e and enquired for his young ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, having, as he ju&s;tly &s;up|po&s;ed, a very plea&s;ing piece of intelligence, to com|municate. Both the young gentleman and lady, who were accu&s;tomed to receive little civilities from Joe, very readily attended him, thinking he had got &s;ome fruit or flowers for them. Well, Joe, &s;aid Mi&s;s Ben&s;on, what have you to &s;ay to us? Have you got a peach or a nectarine? Or have you brought me a root of Sweet William? No, Mi&s;s Harriet, &s;aid Joe, but I have &s;omething to tell you, that will plea&s;e you as much as though I had. What's that? What's that? cried Frederick. Why ma&s;ter Frede|rick, &s;aid Joe, a pair of Robins have <HI>com'd</HI> mortal often to one place in the orchard lately; &s;o, thinks I, the&s;e birds have got a ne&s;t. So, I watches and watc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, and at la&s;t I <HI>&s;ee'd</HI> the old hen fly into a hole in the ivy-wall. I had a fancy to &s;et my ladder and look in, but as ma&s;ter ordered me not to fright|en the birds, I &s;taid till the old one flew out again, and then I mounted, and there I <HI>&s;ee'd</HI> the little crea|tures full fledged; and if you and Mi&s;s Harriet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> go with me, I will &s;hew them to you, for the ne&s;t&mdash;

but a little way from the ground, and you may ea&s;|ily get up the &s;tep-ladder. Frederick was in rap|tures, being confident that the&s;e were the identical Robins that he was &s;o attached to, and (like a little thoughtle&s;s boy as he was) would have gone im|mediately with the gardener, had not his &s;i&s;ter re|minded him, that it was proper to a&s;k mamma's leave fir&s;t, for which purpo&s;e &s;he accompanied him into the parlour. Good news! Good news! mamma, cried Frederick, Joe has found the Robins ne&s;t. Has he indeed? &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on. Yes, mamma, &s;aid Mi&s;s Harrit, and if agreeable to you, we &s;hould be glad to go along with Joe to &s;ee it. And how are you to get at it, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, for I &s;uppo&s;e it is &s;ome height from the ground? Oh! I can climb a ladder very well, cried Frederick. You climb a lad|der! You are a clever gentleman at climbing I know, replied his mamma: but do you propo&s;e to mount too, Harriet? I think this rather an indelicate &s;cheme for a lady. Joe tells me that the ne&s;t is a very little way from the ground, mamma, an&s;wered Harriet, but if I find it otherwi&s;e, you may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end on my not getting up. On this condition I will per|mit you to go; but pray, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r Frederick, let me remind you, not to frighten your little favourites. Not for all the world, &s;aid Frederick; away he &s;kipped, and got to Joe before his &s;i&s;ter. We may go! we may go! Joe, cried he. Stay for me Joe, I beg, &s;aid Mi&s;s Harriet, who pre&s;ently joined him.</P>

<P>When the old ones were &s;eated in the tree, it is time, &s;aid the father, to take our ne&s;tlings abroad.

<P>AS &s;oon as Joe found that the young <HI>gentry,</HI> as he called them, had obtained permi&s;&s;ion to accompany him, he took Frederick by the hand, and &s;aid, come along, my young ma&s;ter, but at mi&s;s Harriet's re|que&s;t, &s;topped whil&s;t &s;he fetched her bonnet and tip|pet. Frederick's impatience was &s;o great, that he could &s;carcely be re&s;trained from running all the way, but that his &s;i&s;ter intreated him not to make him&s;elf too hot. At length they arrived at the de|&s;ired &s;pot; Joe placed the ladder, and his young ma&s;ter, with a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, mounted it very dex|trou&s;ly: But who can de&s;cribe his raptures when he beheld the ne&s;tlings! Oh! the &s;weet creatures, cri|ed he, there are four of them, I declare! I never &s;aw any thing &s;o pretty in my life! I wi&s;h I might carry you all home! That you mu&s;t not do, Frederick, &s;aid his &s;i&s;ter; and I beg you will come away, for you will either terrify the little creatures, or alarm the old birds, which perhaps are now waiting &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">where near to feed them. Well, I will come away direct|ly, &s;aid Frederick, and &s;o good by, Robins! I hope you will come &s;oon, along with your father and mo|ther, to be fed in the parlour. He then, under the conduct of his friend Joe, de&s;cended. Joe next ad|dre&s;&s;ed Mi&s;s Harriet: now my young mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid

he, will you go up? As the &s;teps of the ladder were broad, and the ne&s;t was not high, Mi&s;s Ben&s;on ven|tured to go up, and was equally delighted with her brother; but &s;o fearful of terrifying the little birds, and alarming the old ones, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he would only in|dulge her&s;elf with a peep at the ne&s;t. Frederick enquired how &s;he liked the young Robins? They are &s;weet creatures, &s;aid &s;he, and I hope we &s;hall &s;oon find means to invite them to join our party of birds, for they appear to me ready to fly; but let us return to mamma, for you know we promi&s;ed her to &s;tay but a little while; be&s;ides we hinder Joe from his work.

her habitation, &s;uppo&s;ed, from their being &s;o near, that they had been taking a view of it, and commu|nicated her &s;u&s;picions to her mate. He agreed with her that this had probably been the ca&s;e, and &s;aid he now expected to hear a fine &s;tory from the ne&s;t|lings. Let us return, however, &s;aid the mother, for perhaps they have been terrified again. Well &s;aid he, I will attend you then; but let me caution, you, my dear, not to indulge their fearful di&s;po&s;i|tions, becau&s;e &s;uch indulgence will certainly prove injurious to them. I will do the be&s;t I can, replied he, and then flew to the ne&s;t, followed by her mate. She alighted upon the ivy, and peeping into the ne&s;t, enquired how they all did? Very well, dear mo|ther, &s;aid Robin. What, cried the father, (who now alighted) all &s;afe? Not one eat up by the mon&s;ter? No, father, replied Dicky, we are not de|voured, and yet, I a&s;&s;ure you, the mon&s;ter we &s;aw ye&s;terday has been here again, and brought two others with him.

However, before we were perfectly come to our&s;elves, we heard very uncommon noi&s;es, &s;ome|times a hoar&s;e &s;ound, di&s;agreeable to our cars as the croaking of a raven, and &s;ometimes a &s;hriller noi&s;e, quite unlike the note of any bird that we know of, and immediately after &s;omething pre&s;ented it&s;elf to our view, which bore a re&s;emblance to the mon&s;ter, but not &s;o frightful. In&s;tead of being all over red, it had on each &s;ide two &s;pots of a more beautiful hue than Dicky's brea&s;t, the re&s;t of it was of a mo&s;t deli|cate white, excepting two &s;treaks of a deep red, like the cherry you brought us the other day, and between the&s;e two &s;treaks we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e rows of white bones, but by no means dreadful to behold, like tho&s;e of the great mon&s;ter; its eyes were blue and white, and round this agreeable face was &s;omething which I cannot de&s;cribe, very pretty, and as glo&s;&s;y as the feathers of a Goldfinch. There was &s;o chearful and plea&s;ing a look in this creature altogether, that notwith&s;tanding I own I was rather afraid, yet I had plea&s;ure in looking at it, but it &s;taid a very lit|tle time and then di&s;appeared. Whil&s;t we were puzzling our&s;elves with conjectures concerning it,

another creature, larger than it appeared before us, equally beautiful, and with an a&s;pect &s;o mild and gentle, that we were all charmed with it; but, as if fearful of alarming us by its &s;tay, it immediately re|tired, and we have been longing for your and my mother's return, in hopes you would be able to tell us what we have &s;een.</P>
<P>I am happy, my dears, &s;aid the mother, to find you more compo&s;ed than I expected; for as your father and I were flying together in order to come back to you, we ob&s;erved the mon|&s;ter, and the two pretty creatures Peck&s;y has de&s;cri|bed; the former is, as your father before informed you, our friend the gardener, and the others are our young benefactors, by who&s;e bounty we are every day regaled, and who, I will venture to &s;ay, will do you no harm. You cannot think how kindly they treat us; and though there are a number of other birds who &s;hare their goodne&s;s, your father and I are &s;avoured with their particular regard. Oh, &s;aid Peck&s;y, are the&s;e &s;weet creatures your friends? I long to go abroad that I may &s;ee them again. Well, cried Flap&s;y, I perceive that if we judge from appearances we may often be mi&s;taken; who would have thought that &s;uch an ugly mon&s;ter as that gar|dener, could have had a tender heart? Very true, replied the mother; you mu&s;t make it a rule, Flap&s;y, to judge of <HI>mankind</HI> by their <HI>actions,</HI> and not by their <HI>looks.</HI> I have known &s;ome of them, who&s;e ap|pearance

was as engaging as that of our young be|nefactors, who were, notwith&s;tanding, barbarous enough to take eggs out of a ne&s;t and &s;poil them; nay even carry away ne&s;t and all before the young ones were fledged, without knowing how to feed them, or having any regard to the &s;or|rows of the tender parents. Yes, &s;aid the mother, la&s;t year it was my misfortune to be deprived of my ne&s;tlings in that manner, which occa&s;ions my being &s;o timid; the angui&s;h I &s;uffered for their lo&s;s is not to be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>A calamity of the &s;ame kind befel me, replied the father, I never &s;hall forget it. I had been making an excur&s;ion into the woods, in order to procure &s;ome delicious morfels for one of my ne&s;tlings; when I returned to the place in which I had imprudently built, (for being young and inexperienced, I did not fore&s;ee the danger of chu&s;ing an expo&s;ed &s;ituation,) the fir&s;t circum&s;tance that alarmed me, was a part of my ne&s;t &s;cattered upon the ground, ju&s;t at the en|trance of my habitation; I then perceived a large opening in the wall, where before there was only room for my&s;elf to pa&s;s. I &s;topped with a palpita|ting heart, in hopes of hearing the chirpings of my beloved family; but all was &s;ilence. I then re&s;olved to enter; but what was my con&s;ternation, when I found that the ne&s;t, which my dear mate and I had with &s;o much labour built, and the dear little ones, who were the joy of our lives, were taken
<PB N="53" REF="027817_0052_0FD64E23A1D03830">
away; nay, I did not know but that the tender mother al&s;o was taken captive. I immedi|ately ru&s;hed out of the place, di&s;tracted with appre|hen&s;ions of the mi&s;eries they might endure; lamen|ted my weakne&s;s, which rendered me incapable of effecting their re&s;cue; was ready to tear off my own feathers with vexation; but recollecting that my dear mate might in all probability have e&s;caped, I re&s;olved to go in &s;earch of her. As I was flying along, I &s;aw three boys who&s;e appearance was far from di&s;agreeable; one of whom held in his hand my ne&s;t of young ones, which he eyed with cruel exultation, whil&s;t his companions &s;eemed to &s;hare his joy.</P>
<P>My dear little creatures, in&s;en&s;ible of their fate, (for they were newly hatched) opened their mouths in expectation of the u&s;ual &s;upply, but all in vain, to have attempted feeding them at this time would have been inevitable de&s;truction to my&s;elf; but I re&s;olved to follow the barbarians, that I might at lea&s;t &s;ee to what place my darlings were con&s;igned. In a &s;hort time the party arrived at a hou&s;e, and he who before held the ne&s;t, now committed it to the care of another, but &s;oon returned with a kind of victuals I was totally unacquainted with; and with this my young, when they gaped for food, were fed: hunger induced them to &s;wallow it with avidity,
<PB N="54" REF="027817_0053_0FD64E251F2C3598">
but &s;oon after mi&s;&s;ing the warmth of their mother they &s;et up a general chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p of lamentation which pier|ced my very heart. Immediately after this the ne&s;t was carried away, and what became of my ne&s;tlings afterwards I never could di&s;cover, though I fre|quently hovered about the fatal &s;pot of their impri|&s;onment, with the hope of &s;eeing them.</P>
<P>Pray, father, &s;aid Dicky, what became of your mate? Why, my dear, &s;aid he, when I found there was no chance of a&s;&s;i&s;ting my little ones, I pur&s;ued my cour&s;e, and &s;ought her in every place of our u&s;ual re&s;ort, but to no purpo&s;e: At length I returned to the bu&s;h, where I beheld an afflicting &s;ight indeed, my dear companion lying on the ground, ju&s;t expir|ing! I flew to her in&s;tantly, and endeavoured to recal her to life: at the &s;ound of my voice, &s;he lifted up her languid eye-lids and with feeble accents &s;aid, And are you then &s;afe, my love? What is become of our little ones? In hopes of comforting her, I told her they were alive and well; but &s;he replied, your con&s;olations come too late; the blow is &s;truck, I feel death approaching. The horror which &s;eized me when I mi&s;&s;ed my ne&s;tlings, and &s;uppo&s;ed my&s;elf robbed at once of my mate and infants, was too pow|erful for my weak frame to &s;u&s;tain. Oh! why will the human race be &s;o want only cruel! The agonies of death now came on, and after a few convul&s;ive pangs, &s;he breathed her la&s;t, and left me an unhap|py widower. I pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the &s;ummer,
<PB N="55" REF="027817_0054_0FD64E28A8455F38">
and a dreary winter that &s;ucceeded it, in a very uncomfortable manner; though the natural cheerful|ne&s;s of my di&s;po&s;ition, did not leave me long a prey to unavailing &s;orrow: and having paid a proper tri|bute to the memory of my fir&s;t dear mate, I re&s;olved the following &s;pring to &s;eek another; and had the good fortune to meet with one, who&s;e amiable di&s;|po&s;ition has renewed my former happine&s;s: and now, my dear &s;aid he, let me a&s;k you what became of your former companion? Why, replied the hen Redbrea&s;t, &s;oon after the lo&s;s of our ne&s;t, as he was endeavouring to di&s;cover what was become of it, a cruel hawk caught him up, and devoured him in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>I need not &s;ay that I felt the bittere&s;t pangs for his lo&s;s; it is &s;ufficient to inform you that I led a &s;o|litary life, till I met with you, who&s;e endearing be|haviour has made &s;ociety again agreeable to me.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the parent birds were thus relating the hi&s;|tory of their pa&s;t misfortunes, the young ones li&s;ten|ed with the greate&s;t attention; and when the tales were ended, Flap&s;y exclaimed, Oh! what dangers there are in the world! I &s;hall be afraid to leave the ne&s;t. Why &s;o, my love? &s;aid the mother. Every bird does not meet with Hawks and cruel children. You have already, as you &s;at on the ne&s;t, &s;een thou|&s;ands of the feathered race, of one kind or other, making their airy excur&s;ions, full of mirth and gaie|ty.

of tho&s;e who chaunt forth their &s;ongs of joy, and I believe there are no beings in the world hap|pier than birds, for we are naturally formed for cheerfulne&s;s; and I flatter my&s;elf, a prudent precau|tion will pre&s;erve both your father and my&s;elf from any future accident. Our parents were young and unexperienced them&s;elves, and did not give us good advice; but we know the dangers of the world, and I hope &s;hall be able to point out to you &s;uch rules of conduct as may, if followed, counteract the u&s;ual ac|cidents to which birds are expo&s;ed. In&s;tead of in|dulging your fears, Flap&s;y, &s;aid the father, &s;ummon up all your courage, for to-morrow you &s;hall, with your brothers and &s;i&s;ter, begin to &s;ee the world. Dicky expre&s;&s;ed great delight at this declaration, and Robin boa&s;ted that he had not the lea&s;t remains of fear. Flap&s;y, though &s;till apprehen&s;ive of mon|&s;ters, yet longed to &s;ee the gaieties of life, and Peck|&s;y wi&s;hed to comply with every de&s;ire of her dear parents. The approach of evening now reminded them that it was time to take repo&s;e, and turning their heads under their wings, each bird &s;oon re&s;ign|ed it&s;elf to the gentle power of &s;leep.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;s Ben&s;on had been grati|fied with the &s;ight of the Robin's ne&s;t, they were re|turning to the hou&s;e, conducted by their friend Joe, when they were met in the garden by their papa and mamma, accompanied by Mi&s;s Lucy Jenkins and her brother Edward. The former was a fine girl about ten years old, the latter a robu&s;t rude boy, turned of eleven. We were coming to &s;eek you, my dears, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on to her children, for I was fearful that the bu&s;ine&s;s you went upon would make you forget your young vi&s;itors. I cannot an&s;wer for Frederick, replied Mi&s;s Ben&s;on, but indeed, my dear mamma, I would not on any account have &s;lighted my friends. How do you do, my dear mi&s;s Jenkins? &s;aid &s;he, I am happy to &s;ee you. Will you go with me into the play-room? I have got &s;ome very pretty new books. Frederick, have you nothing to &s;hew Ma&s;ter Jenkins? O yes, &s;aid Fre|derick, I have got a new ball, a new top, a new organ, and twenty pretty things; but I had rather go back and &s;hew him the Robins. The Robins! &s;aid Ma&s;ter Jenkins, what Robins? Why our Ro|bins, that have built in the ivy-wall. You never &s;aw any thing &s;o pretty in your life as the little ones. Oh, I can &s;ee birds enow at home, &s;aid Ma&s;|ter Jenkins; but why did you not take the ne&s;t? It

would have been nice diver&s;ion to you to to&s;s the young birds about. I have had a great many ne&s;ts this year, and do believe I have an hundred eggs. An hundred eggs! and how do you purpo&s;e to hatch them? &s;aid Mi&s;s Harriet, who turned back on hear|ing him talk in this manner. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tch them Mi&s;s Ben|&s;on? &s;aid he; who ever thinks of hatching birds eggs? Oh, then you eat them, &s;aid Frederick, or perhaps let your cook make puddings of them? No, indeed, replied Ma&s;ter Jenkins, I blow out the in|&s;ide, and then run a thread through them, and give them to Lucy to hang up among&s;t her curio&s;ities, and very pretty they look, I a&s;&s;ure you. And &s;o, &s;aid Mi&s;s Harriet, you had rather &s;ee a parcel of empty egg-&s;hells, than hear a &s;weet concert of birds &s;ing|ing in the trees? I admire your ta&s;te truly! Why, is there any harm in taking birds eggs? &s;aid Mi&s;s Jenkins; I never before heard there was. My dear mamma, replied Mi&s;s Ben&s;on, has taught me to think, there is harm in every action which gives cau&s;ele&s;s pain to any living creature; and I own I have a very particular affection for birds. Well, &s;aid Mi&s;s Jenkins, I have no notion of &s;uch affecti|ons, for my part. Sometimes, indeed I try to rear tho&s;e which Edward brings home, but they are teazing trouble&s;ome things, and I am not lucky; to tell the truth I do not concern my&s;elf much about them; if they <HI>live</HI> they <HI>live,</HI> and if they <HI>die</HI> they <HI>die.</HI> He has brought me three ne&s;ts this day to plague

me; I thought to have fed the birds before I came out, but being in a hurry to come and &s;ee you, I quite forgot it. Did you feed them, Edward? Not I, &s;aid he, I thought you would do it; 'tis enough for me to find the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s. And have you actually left three ne&s;ts of young birds at home without victuals! exclaimed Mi&s;s Harriet. I did not think of them, but will feed them when I return, &s;aid Mi&s;s Jenkins. Oh, cried Mi&s;s Ben&s;on, I cannot bear the thoughts of what the poor little creatures mu&s;t &s;uffer. Well, &s;aid Ma&s;ter Jenkins, &s;ince you feel &s;o much for them, I think, Mi&s;s Harriet, you will make the be&s;t nur&s;e. What &s;ay you, Lucy, will you give the ne&s;ts to Mi&s;s Ben&s;on? With all my heart, replied his &s;i&s;ter, and pray do not plague me with any more of them. I do not know that my mamma will let me accept them, &s;aid Mi&s;s Ben&s;on, but if &s;he will, I &s;hall be glad to do &s;o. Frederick enquired what birds they were, and Ma&s;ter Jenkins informed him, there was a ne&s;t of Linnets, a ne&s;t of Sparrows, and another of Blackbirds. Frederick was all impatience to &s;ee them, and Mi&s;s Harriet longed to have the little creatures in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that &s;he might re&s;cue them from their deplorable condition, and le&s;&s;en the evils of captivity, which they now &s;uffered in the ex|treme. Her mamma had left her with her young company, that they might indulge them&s;elves in innocent amu&s;ements without re&s;traint, but the ten|der-hearted Harriet could not engage in any diver|&s;ion

till &s;he had made interce&s;&s;ion in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the poor birds, &s;he therefore begged Mi&s;s Jenkins would accompany her to her mamma, in order to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it permi&s;&s;ion to have the birds n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

Harriet, from an unwilling|ne&s;s to expect her friend, had &s;aid but little on the &s;ubject, but Mrs. Ben&s;on, having great di&s;cernment, concluded that &s;he made the reque&s;t from a merciful motive, and knowing that Mi&s;s Jenkins had no kind mamma to give her in&s;truction, &s;he thus addre&s;&s;ed her:</P>
<P>I perceive, my young friend, that Harriet is ap|prehen&s;ive the birds will not meet with the &s;ame kind treatment from you, which &s;he is di&s;po&s;ed to give them. I cannot think you have any cruelty in your nature, but perhaps you have only accu&s;tomed your&s;elf to con&s;ider birds as playthings, without &s;en&s;e or feeling; to me, who are a great admirer of the beautiful little creatures, they appear in a very different light; and I have been an attentive ob&s;er|ver of them. I a&s;&s;ure you.

I knew your dear mamma, and can a&s;&s;ure you, &s;he

was remarkable for the tenderne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;i|tion. But let me not detain you from your amu&s;e|ments; go to your own apartments, Harriet, and u&s;e your be&s;t endeavours to make your vi&s;itors hap|py. You cannot this evening fetch the birds, be|cau&s;e, when Mi&s;s Jenkins goes it will be too late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or you to take &s;o long a walk, as you mu&s;t come back afterwards; and I make no doubt but that to oblige you, &s;he will feed them to-night. Mi&s;s Harriet and Mi&s;s Jenkins returned, and found Fre|derick diverting him&s;elf with a hand organ, which had lately been pre&s;ented by his good-papa; but ma&s;ter Jenkins had laid hold of Mi&s;s Harriet's dog, and was &s;earching his own pocked for a piece of &s;tring, that he might tie him and the cat together, to &s;ee, as he &s;aid, how nicely they would fight: and &s;o fully was he bent on this cruel purpo&s;e, that it was with difficulty he could be prevailed on to relinqui&s;h it. Dear me, &s;aid he, if ever I came into &s;uch a hou&s;e in my life, there is no <HI>fun</HI> here. What would you have &s;aid to Harry Pritchard and me, the other day, when we made the cats fly? Made cats fly! &s;aid Frederick, how was that? Why, replied he, we tied bladders to each &s;ide of their necks, and then flung them from the top of the hou&s;e. There was an end of their purring and mewing for &s;ome time, I a&s;&s;ure you, for they lay a long while &s;truggling and ga&s;ping for breath; and if they had not had nine lives, I think they mu&s;t

have died; but at la&s;t up they jumped, and away ran &s;campering. Then out came little Jemmy, crying as if he had flown down him&s;elf becau&s;e we hurt the poor cats; he had a dog running after him, who I &s;uppo&s;e, meant to call us to ta&s;k, with his <HI>bow, wow;</HI> but we &s;oon &s;topped his tongue, for we caught the gentleman and drove him before us into a narrow lane, and then ran hooting after him into the village; a number of boys joined us, and cried out as we did, <HI>a mad dog! a mad dog!</HI> On this &s;everal people pur&s;ued him with cudgels and broom&s;ticks, and at la&s;t he was &s;hot by a man, but not dead, &s;o others came and knocked him about the head till he expired. For &s;hame! Ma&s;ter Jen|kins, &s;aid Mi&s;s Harriet, how can you talk in that rhodomontade manner? I cannot believe any young gentleman could bring his heart to &s;uch barbarities. Barbarities, indeed! why have we not a <HI>right</HI> to do as we plea&s;e to dogs and cats, or do you think they <HI>feel</HI> as we do? Fiddle faddle of your non&s;en&s;e, &s;ay I; come, you mu&s;t hear the end of my &s;tory. When the dog was dead, we carried him home to little Jemmy, who was ready to break his heart for the lo&s;s of him; &s;o we did not like to &s;tand hearing his whining, therefore we left him and got a Cock, who&s;e legs were tied, and flung at him till he died. Then we &s;et two others to fig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting, and fine &s;port we had; for one was pecked till his brea&s;t

After this we picked all the feathers off a live chicken, and you never &s;aw &s;uch a ridiculous little animal in your life. Then we got &s;ome puppies, and drowned them whil&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itch &s;tood by. Oh! how &s;he howled and cried, whil&s;t they &s;truggled on the &s;urface of the water; and there was no quieting her for &s;everal days. Stop! Stop! ex|claimed Mi&s;s Harriet; for pity's &s;ake, &s;top! I can hear no more of your horrid narrations; nor would I commit even <HI>one</HI> of tho&s;e barbarities which you boa&s;t of for the world! Poor innocent creatures! what had they done to you to de&s;erve &s;uch u&s;age? I beg Edward, &s;aid his &s;i&s;ter, that you will find &s;ome other way to entertain us, or I &s;hall really tell Mrs. Ben&s;on of you. What! are you growing tenderhearted all at once! cried he.

<PB N="65" REF="027817_0064_0FD64E3ED0EA94E8">
been driven by a cruel drover till he went mad: but Mi&s;s Ben&s;on and his &s;i&s;ter &s;topped their ears. As &s;oon as they left off doing &s;o, he began another about Bat-fowling; which is a treacherous cu&s;tom of going with a lantern by night to the hedges. where birds roo&s;t, and frightening them into a net placed for the purpo&s;e. In &s;hort, it appeared from his di&s;cour&s;e, that he was acquainted with the whole art of tormenting animals. At la&s;t little Frederick went crying to his mamma, and the young ladies retired to another apartment, &s;o Ma&s;|ter Jenkins amu&s;ed him&s;elf with catching flies in the window, pulling the legs off from &s;ome and the wings from others, delighted with their extor|&s;ions, which were occa&s;ioned by the agonies they endured. Mrs. Ben&s;on had &s;ome vi&s;itors, which prevented her talking of this cruel boy, as &s;he otherwi&s;e would have done, on hearing Frederick's account of him, but &s;he determined to tell his papa; which &s;he accordingly did &s;ome time after, when he returned home: but this gentleman, &s;o far from reproving his &s;on, applauded him as a lad of life and &s;pirit, and &s;aid he would be fit to go through the world.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter Jenkins was now di&s;turbed from his bar|barous &s;port by being called to tea; and &s;oon after that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as over, the &s;ervant came to fetch him and

Mi&s;s Harriet earne&s;tly entreated her friend Lucy to feed the birds properly, till &s;he &s;hould be allowed to fetch them, who promi&s;ed to do &s;o; for &s;he was greatly affected with Mrs. Ben|&s;on's di&s;cour&s;e, and then entreated her brother to take leave, that &s;he might return home; with this he readily complied, as there were no further op|portunities for cruelty.</P>

<P>AFTER her little vi&s;itors were departed, Mi&s;s Harriet went into the drawing-room, and having paid her compliments, &s;at her&s;elf down, that &s;he might improve her mind with the conver|&s;ation of the company. Her mamma perceived that &s;he had been in tears, of which Frederick be|fore explained the cau&s;e. I do not wonder, my love, &s;aid &s;he, that you &s;hould have been &s;o affect|ed with the relation of &s;uch horrid barbarities, as that thoughtle&s;s boy has, by degrees, brought him|&s;elf to practi&s;e not only without remor&s;e, but by way of amu&s;ement. However, do not &s;uffer your mind to dwell on them, as the creatures on which he inflicted them are no longer objects of pity. It is wrong to grieve for the death of animal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we do for the lo&s;s of our friends, becau&s;e they certain|ly
<PB N="67" REF="027817_0066_0FD64E471DC0B300">
are not of &s;o much con&s;equence to our happine&s;s; and we are taught to think their &s;ufferings end with their lives, as they are not religious beings; and therefore the killing them even in the cruele&s;t manner, is not like murdering a human creature, who is perhaps unprepared to give an account of him&s;elf at the tribunal of heaven. I have, &s;aid a Lady who was pre&s;ent, been for a long time ac|cu&s;tomed to con&s;ider animals as mere machines ac|tuated by the unerring hand of Providence, to do tho&s;e things which are nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;erva|tion of them&s;elves and their offspring; but the &s;ight of the learned Pig, which has lately been &s;hewn in London, has deranged the&s;e ideas, and I know not what to think.</P>
<P>If we puzzle our minds for ever, Madam, on the &s;ubject, replied a Gentleman, we &s;hall never be able fully to comprehend the capacities and feelings of creatures &s;o different from our&s;elves. That they have not rea&s;onable &s;ouls, like the human race, is evident: but at the &s;ame time I think we may plain|ly di&s;cover, that they have &s;ome proportion of in|tellect, which is even capable of improvment to a certain degree: this is particularly exemplified in the in&s;tance which Mrs. Franks has ju&s;t men|tioned of the learned Pig. Mere in&s;tinct, I think, would never lead that creature to di&s;tingui&s;h one letter from another, or, which amount<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="68" REF="027817_0067_0FD64E4865869528">
to the &s;ame thing, to comprehend the various &s;igns by which they are pointed out to him by his keeper. To what a pitch may Dogs and Hor&s;es be improved; nay, every kind of animal that I have had an opportunity of ob&s;erving, &s;eems to acquire &s;agacity, by a familiar intercour&s;e with rational creatures, yet, after all, they fall &s;hort of human rea&s;on beyond compari&s;on.</P>
<P>For my part, replied Mrs. Ben&s;on, I find the &s;ubject &s;o much above my comprehen&s;ion, that whenever my mind is di&s;po&s;ed to expatiate on it, I check the inclination, from an opinion that it is of no con&s;equence to me, whether animals have intellects or not, and that it is among&s;t tho&s;e things which the Almighty has intentionally con|cealed from our penetration. That they are in the power of man, and &s;ub&s;ervient to his u&s;e and plea&s;ure, gives them a &s;ufficient claim to our compa&s;&s;ion and kindne&s;s; and whil&s;t I am partly fed and clothed at the expence of the animal creation, I could not bring my&s;elf to inflict wanton cruelties upon them. On the other hand, as Pro|vidence has placed them &s;o much beneath us in the &s;cale of beings, I &s;hould think it equally wrong to elevate them from their proper rank in life, and &s;uffer them to occupy that &s;hare of attention and love, which is due to our own &s;pecies only&punc;</P>
<P>You are certainly right, Madam, an&s;wered the
<PB N="69" REF="027817_0068_0FD64E49F0B3D5A0">
Gentleman; there are objects enough for the em|ployment of human rea&s;on, without our endeavour|ing to penetrate into tho&s;e things which mu&s;t for ever remain hidden, unle&s;s the inferior creatures were endued with &s;peech. We can form but very imperfect ideas even of our own intellectual powers, &s;till le&s;s of tho&s;e of other men; and the further any creature is removed from us, the le&s;s capable are we of comprehending their natures, as we can on|ly judge, in the&s;e matters, by what pa&s;&s;es in our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Neither you, Sir, nor Mrs. Ben&s;on, &s;aid Mrs. Franks, mean, I apprehend, to di&s;courage the &s;tudy of the natural hi&s;tory of animals. By no means, replied the latter; for as far as it is open to our view, it is replete with amu&s;ement and in&s;truction. It leads the mind to contemplate the perfections of the Supreme Being, and al&s;o furni&s;hes a variety of u&s;eful hints for the conduct of human affairs. Many important arts have, in all probability, been derived from them; and the exact regularity with which they di&s;charge the offices of tenderne&s;s and oeconomy, afford examples of real utility to tho&s;e among&s;t us, who are di&s;po&s;ed to neglect the duties of humanity. An idle per&s;on, for in&s;tance, may be admoni&s;hed by an Ant or Bee, a thoughtle&s;s mother by a Hen, an unfaithful &s;ervant by a Dog, and &s;o on, as one of our Poets has elegantly pointed out

I only mean that we &s;hould con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine our &s;peculations within due bounds, and not carele&s;s animals to the neglect of the human race.</P>
<P>Then you would have condemned a Lady of my acquaintance &s;aid the Gentleman, who has a little Lap-dog on which her happine&s;s totally depends, and to u&s;e a vulgar expre&s;&s;ion, her very life &s;eems to be wrapt up in his I am &s;ure it is quite pro|voking to &s;ee a rea&s;onable creature make her&s;elf &s;o ridiculous. It is more than ridiculous, replied Mrs. Ben&s;on; it is really &s;inful. At this in&s;tant the arrival of Mrs. Franks's coach was announced, and &s;he with the Gentlemen took leave.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were gone, pray mamma, &s;aid Harriet, what does the learned Pig do? I had a great de&s;ire to a&s;k Mrs. Franks, but was fearful &s;he would think me impertinent. I commend your mode&s;ty my dear, replied Mrs. Ben&s;on, but would not have lead you into &s;uch a degree of re&s;traint, as to prevent your gratifying that laudable curio&s;i|ty, without which young per&s;ons mu&s;t remain ig|norent of many things very proper for them to be acquainted with. Mrs. Franks would, I am &s;ure, have been far from thinking you impertinent: Tho&s;e enquiries only are thought trouble&s;ome, by which children interrupt conver&s;ation, and endea|vour to attract attention to their own in&s;ignificant
<PB N="71" REF="027817_0070_0FD64E51E59F35D8">
prattle; but all people of good &s;en&s;e and good na|ture delight in giving them u&s;eful information. In re&s;pect to the learned Pig, I have heard things which are quite a&s;toni&s;hing in a &s;pecies of animals generally regarded as very &s;tupid. The creature was &s;hewn for a &s;ight in a room provided for the purpo&s;e, where a number of people a&s;&s;embled to view his performances. Two alphabets of large letters on card paper were placed on the floor: one of the company was then de&s;ired to propo&s;e a word which he wi&s;hed the Pig to &s;pell. This his keeper repeated to him, and the Pig picked out every letter &s;ucce&s;&s;ively with his &s;nout, and collected them together till the word was compleated. He was then de&s;ired to tell the hour of the day, and one of the company held a watch to him, which he &s;eemed with his little cunning eyes to examine very attentively; and having done &s;o, picked out figures for the hour and minutes of the day. He &s;hewed a number of tricks of the &s;ame nature, to the great diver&s;ion of the &s;pectator<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. For my own part, though I was in London at the time he was exhibit|ed, and heard continually of this wonderful Pig from per&s;ons of my acquaintance, I never went to &s;ee him; for I am fully per&s;uaded, that great cruelty mu&s;t have been exerci&s;ed in teaching him things &s;o foreign to his nature, and therefore would not give any encouragement to &s;uch a &s;cheme.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="027817_0071_0FD64E53D302AF18">And do you think, mamma, &s;aid Harriet, that the Pig knows the letters, and can really &s;pell words? I think it po&s;&s;ible, my dear, for the Pig to be taught to know the letters one from the other, and that his keeper has &s;ome private &s;ign, by which he directs him to each that are wanted;&mdash;but that he has an idea of <HI>&s;pelling,</HI> I can never believe, nor are animals capable of attaining human &s;ciences, becau&s;e, for the&s;e, human faculties are requi&s;ite; and no art of man can <HI>change</HI> the nature of any thing, though we may be able to improve that na|ture to a certain degree, or at lea&s;t to call forth to view, powers which would be hidden from us, be|cau&s;e they would only be exerted in the intercour&s;e of animals with each other. As far as this can be done by familiarizing them, and &s;hewing them &s;uch a degree of kindne&s;s as is con&s;i&s;tent with our higher obligations, it may be an agreeable amu&s;e|ment, but will never an&s;wer any important pur|po&s;e to mankind; and I would advi&s;e you, Harriet, never to give countenance to tho&s;e people who &s;hew what they call <HI>learned</HI> animals; as you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf they exerci&s;e great barbarities upon them, of which &s;tarving them almo&s;t to death is mo&s;t likely among the number.

<P>EARLY in the morning the hen Redbre&s;t awak|ened her young brood. Come, my little ones, &s;aid &s;he, &s;hake off your drow&s;ine&s;s, remember this is the day fixed for your entrance into the world. I de&s;ire that each of you will dre&s;s your feathers before you go out; for a &s;lovenly bird is my aver|&s;ion, and neatne&s;s is a great advantage to the ap|pearance of every one.</P>
<P>The father was upon the wing betimes, that he might give each of his young ones a breakfa&s;t before they attempted to leave the ne&s;t. When he had fed them, he de&s;ired his mate to accompany him as u&s;ual to Mrs. Ben&s;on's, where he found the par|lour window open, and his young friends at break|fa&s;t with their papa and mamma. Crumbs had been, according to cu&s;tom, &s;trewed before the window, which the other birds had almo&s;t entirely devoured; but the Redbrea&s;ts took their u&s;ual po&s;t on the tea-table, and the cock bird &s;ung his morn|ing lay; after which they returned with all po&s;ible &s;peed to the ne&s;t, for having &s;o important an affair to manage, they could not be long ab&s;ent. Neither could their young benefactors pay &s;o much atten|tion to them as u&s;ual, for they were impatient to
<PB N="74" REF="027817_0073_0FD64E56C94C4F60">
fetch the birds ne&s;ts from Mi&s;s Jenkin's; therefore, as &s;oon as breakfa&s;t was ended, they &s;et out on their expedition. Harriet carried a ba&s;ket large enough to hold two ne&s;ts, and Frederick a &s;maller one for the other; thus equipped, with a &s;ervant attending them, they &s;et off.</P>
<P>Mr. Jenkins's hou&s;e was about a mile from Mr. Ben&s;on's, it was delightfully &s;ituated; there was a beaut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful lawn and canal before it, and a charming garden behind; on one &s;ide were corn fields, and on the other a wood. In &s;uch a delightful retreat as this, it was natural to expect to find a great many birds; but, to Mi&s;s Harriet's &s;urprize they only &s;aw a few &s;traggling ones here and there, who fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation as &s;oon as &s;he and her brother appeared; on which &s;he ob&s;erved to Frederick, that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed Ma&s;ter Jenkin's practice of taking birds ne&s;ts had made them &s;o &s;hy, and entreated him never to commit &s;o barbarous an action. She &s;aid a great deal to him about the cru|elties that naughty boy had boa&s;ted of the evening before, which Frederick promi&s;ed to remember.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they arrived at the hou&s;e, Mi&s;s Jenk|ins ran out to receive them, but her brother was gone to &s;chool. We are come, my dear Lucy, &s;aid Mi&s;s Ben&s;on, to claim the performance of Ma&s;ter Jenkin's promi&s;e; how are your little pri&s;oners?
<PB N="75" REF="027817_0074_0FD64E5CB3EEF3D0">
O! I know not what to &s;ay to you, my dear, &s;aid Mi&s;s Jenkins, I have very bad news to tell you, and I fear you will blame me exceedingly, though not more than I blame my&s;elf. I heartily wi&s;h I had returned home immediately after the kind lec|ture your mamma favoured me with ye&s;terday, which &s;hewed me the cruelty of my behaviour, though I was then a&s;hamed to own my conviction. I walked as fa&s;t as I could all the way from your hou&s;e, and determined to give each of the little creatures a good &s;upper; for which purpo&s;e I had an egg boiled and very nicely chopped; I mixed up &s;ome bread and water very &s;mooth, and put a little &s;eed with the chopped egg among&s;t it, and then carried it to the room where I left the ne&s;ts. But what was my concern, when I found that my care was too late for the greate&s;t part of them! Every Sparrow lay dead and bloody, they &s;eemed to have killed each other. Urged I &s;uppo&s;e by ex|treme hunger, each &s;pent on his unhappy a&s;&s;ociates tho&s;e pecks and blows which were my proper de|&s;ert. In the ne&s;t of Linnets, which were very young, I found one dead, two ju&s;t expiring, and the other almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, but &s;till able to &s;wal|low;

to him, therefore, I immediately di&s;pen&s;ed &s;ome of the food I had prepared, which greatly revived him; and as I thought he would &s;uffer with cold in the ne&s;t by him&s;elf, I covered him over with wool, and had this morning the plea&s;ure of finding him quite recovered. What, all the Spar|rows and three Linnets dead! &s;aid Frederick, who&s;e little eyes &s;wam with tears at the melancho|ly tale: And pray, Mi&s;s Jenkins, have you &s;tarved all the Blackbirds too? Not all, my little friend, an&s;wered Mi&s;s Jenkins, but I mu&s;t confe&s;s that &s;ome of them have fallen victims to my barbarous neglect; however, there are two fine once alive, which I &s;hall, with the &s;urviving Linnet, cheerfully re&s;ign to the care of my dear Harriet, who&s;e tenderne&s;s will, I hope, be rewarded by the plea&s;ure of hear|ing them &s;ing when they are old enough. But I beg you will &s;tay and re&s;t your&s;elves after your walk. Let me &s;ee the birds fir&s;t, &s;aid Frederick. That you &s;hall do, an&s;wered Mi&s;s Jenkins; and taking him by the hand, conducted him to the room in which &s;he kept them, accompanied by Mi&s;s Ben|&s;on. She then fed the birds, and gave particular in&s;tructions for making their food, and declared that &s;he would never be a receiver of birds ne&s;ts any more, but expre&s;&s;ed her apprehen&s;ions that it would be difficult to wean Edward from his pro|pen&s;ity for taking them; however, &s;aid &s;he, he is

going as a boarder to a private Academy &s;oon, where I think he will have better employment for his le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ure hours. Mi&s;s Jenkins then took her young friends into the parlour to her Coverne&s;s (for her mamma was dead) who received them very kindly, and gave each of them a piece of cake and &s;ome fruit; after which Mi&s;s Jenkins led them again in|to the room where the birds were, and very care|fully put the ne&s;t, with the poor &s;olitary Linnet, into one ba&s;ket, and that with the two Blackbirds into the other. Frederick was very urgent to carry the latter, which his &s;i&s;ter con&s;ented to; and then, bidding adieu to their friend, they &s;et off on their return home, attented by the maid as before.</P>
<P>Well, Frederick, &s;aid Mi&s;s Harriet, as they walked along, what think you of birdne&s;ting now? Should you like to occa&s;ion the death of &s;o many harmle&s;s little creatures? No, indeed, &s;aid Fre|derick; and I think Mi&s;s Jenkins a very naughty girl for &s;tarving them. She was to blame, but is now &s;orry for her fault, my dear, therefore you mu&s;t not &s;peak unkindly of her; be&s;ides, you know, &s;he has no good mamma, as we have, to teach her what is proper; and her papa is obliged to be ab|&s;ent from home very often, and leave her to the care of a Governe&s;s, who perhaps was never in|&s;tructed her&s;elf to be tender to animals. With this kind of conver&s;ation they amu&s;ed them&s;elves as they walked, every now and then peeping into their
<PB N="78" REF="027817_0077_0FD64E6139D83270">
ba&s;kets to &s;ee their little birds, which were very lively and well. They entreated the maid to take them through the orchard, which had a gate that opened into a meadow that lay in their way, having no doubt of obtaining admittance, as it was the u&s;ual hour for their friend Joe to work there. They accordingly knocked at the gate, which was immediately opened to them, and Frederick re|que&s;ted Joe to &s;hew him the Robins ne&s;t. But be|fore we proceed to this part of our Hi&s;tory, we mu&s;t return to the Redbre&s;ts, whom we left on the wing, flying back to the ivy-wall, in order to take their young ones abroad.</P>

<P>AS the father entered the ne&s;t, he cried out, with a cheerful voice, Well, my ne&s;tlings are you all ready? Yes, they replied. The mother then advanced, and de&s;ired that each of them would get upon the edge of the ne&s;t. Robin and Peck&s;y &s;prang up in an in&s;tant, but Dicky and Flap&s;y being ti|merous, were not &s;o expeditious. The hearts of the parents felt a rapturous delight at the advan|tageous view they had now of their young family who appeared to be &s;trong, vigorous, and lively: and, in a word, endued with every gift of nature
<PB N="79" REF="027817_0078_0FD64E63710F2C70">
requi&s;ite to their &s;ucce&s;s in the world. Now, &s;aid the father, &s;tretch your wings a little, Robin, and flut|ter them a little in this manner, (&s;hewing him the way) and be &s;ure to ob&s;erve my directions exactly. Very well &s;aid he; do not attempt to fly yet, for here is neither air nor &s;pace enough for that pur|po&s;e. Walk gently after me to the wall, now hop and perch upon this branch, and as &s;oon as you &s;ee me fly away, &s;pread your wings and exert all the &s;trength you have to follow me. Robin acquitted him&s;elf to admiration, and alighted very &s;afely on the ground. Now &s;tand &s;till, &s;aid the father till the re&s;t join us: Then going back, he called upon Dic|ky to do the &s;ame as his brother had done; but Dicky was very fearful of fluttering his wings, for he had a great deal of cowardice in his di&s;po&s;ition, and expre&s;&s;ed many apprehen&s;ions that he &s;hould not be able to reach the ground without falling, as they were at &s;uch a great height from it. His fa|ther who was a very courageous bird, was quite an|gry with him. Why you fooli&s;h little thing, &s;aid he, do you mean to &s;tay in the ne&s;t by your&s;elf and &s;tarve? I &s;hall leave off bringing you food, I a&s;&s;ure you. Do you think your wings were given to be always folded by your &s;ides, and that the whole employment of your life is to pick your feathers, and make your&s;elf look pretty? Without exerci&s;e you cannot long enjoy health; be&s;ides you will &s;oon
<PB N="80" REF="027817_0079_0FD64E65F21BFCD8">
have your livelihood to earn, and therefore idle|ne&s;s in you would be the height of folly; get up this in&s;tant. Dicky, intimidated by his father's di&s;|plea&s;ure, got up, and advanced as far as the branch from which he was to de&s;cend; but here his fears returned, and in&s;tead of making an effort to fly, he &s;tood flapping his wings in a mo&s;t irre&s;olute manner, and &s;uffered his father to lead the way twice with|out following him. This good parent, finding he would not venture to fly, took a circuit unpercei|ved by Dicky, and watching the opportunity when his wings were a little &s;pread, came &s;uddenly be|hind him, and pu&s;hed him off from the branch. Dicky, finding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im&s;elf in actual danger of falling, now gladly &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed his pinions, and upborn by the air, gently de&s;cended to the ground, &s;o near the &s;pot where Robin &s;tood, that the latter ea&s;ily reached him by hopping. The mother now under|took to conduct Flap&s;y and Peck&s;y, whild&s;t the fa|ther &s;taid to take care of the two already landed. Flap&s;y made a thou&s;and difficulties, but at length yielded to her mother's per&s;ua&s;ions, and flew &s;afely down. Peck&s;y without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, accom|panied her, and by exactly following the directi|ons given, found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he ta&s;k much ea&s;ier than &s;he ex|pected. As &s;oon as they had a little r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vered from the fatigue and fright of their fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay at flying, they began to look around them with a&s;toni&s;hment.
<PB N="81" REF="027817_0080_0FD64E69903E0138">
Every object on which they turned their eyes ex|cited their curio&s;ity and wonder. They were no longer confined to a &s;mall ne&s;t, built in a &s;mall hole, but were now at full liberty in the open air. The orchard it&s;elf appeared to them a world. For &s;ome time each remained &s;ilent, gazing around, fir&s;t at one thing, and then at another: at length Flap&s;y cried out, what a charming place the world is! I had no conception it was half &s;o big! And do you &s;uppo&s;e then, replied the mother, that you now be|hold the whole world? I have &s;een but a &s;mall part of it my&s;elf, and yet have flown over &s;o large a &s;pace, that what is at pre&s;ent within our view ap|pears to me a little incon&s;iderable &s;pot, and I have conver&s;ed with &s;everal foreign birds, who informed me that the country they came from was &s;o far di&s;|tant, that they were many days on their journey hi|ther, though they flew the neare&s;t way, and &s;carcely allowed them&s;elves any re&s;ting time. Come, &s;aid the father, let us proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s, we did not leave the ne&s;t merely to look about us. You are now, my young ones, &s;afely landed on the ground, let me in&s;truct you what you are to do on it. Every living creature that comes into the world has &s;omething allotted him to perform, and therefore &s;hould not

&s;tand an idle &s;pectator of what others are doing. We &s;mall birds have a very ea&s;y ta&s;k in compari&s;on of many animals I have had an opportunity of ob|&s;erving, being only required to &s;eek food for our|&s;elves, build ne&s;ts, and provide for our young ones till they are able to procure their own livelihood. We have indeed enemies to dread; Hawks and o|ther birds of prey will catch us up, if we are not up|on our guard; but the wor&s;t of foes we have are tho&s;e of the human race; though even among them Redbre&s;ts have a better chance than many other birds, on account of a charitable action which a pair of our &s;pecies are &s;aid to have performed to a little boy and girl <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the ballad of the children of the wood.</NOTE> who were lo&s;t in a wood where they were &s;tarved to death. The Redbrea&s;ts I mentioned &s;aw the affectionate pair hand in hand, &s;tretched on the cold ground, and would have fed them had they been capable of receiving nouri&s;h|ment; but finding them quit dead, and being una|ble to bury them, re&s;olved to cover them with leaves. This was an arduous ta&s;k, but many a Redbrea&s;t has &s;ince &s;hared the reward of it, and I believe that tho&s;e that do good to others, will al|ways meet with a recompence &s;ome way or other.
<PB N="83" REF="027817_0082_0FD64E6C8B1EC958">
But I declare I am doing the very thing I was re|proving you for&mdash;chattering away when I &s;hould be minding bu&s;ine&s;s. Come, hop after me, and we &s;hall &s;oon find &s;omething worth having. Fear no|thing, for you are now in a place of &s;ecurity; there is no Hawk near, and I have never &s;een any of the human race enter this orchard, but the mon&s;ters who paid you vi&s;its in the ne&s;t, and others equally inoffen|&s;ive. The father then hopped away, followed by Robin and Dicky, whil&s;t his mate conducted the fe|male part of the family. The parents in&s;tructed the young ones in what manner to &s;eek for food, and they proved very &s;ucce&s;sful, for there were a great number of in&s;ects ju&s;t at hand. Dicky had the good fortune to find four little worms together, but in|&s;tead of calling his brothers and &s;i&s;ters to partake of them, he devoured them all him&s;elf. Are you not a&s;hamed you little greedy creature? cried his fa|ther, who ob&s;erved his &s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, What would you think of your brothers and &s;i&s;ters, were they to &s;erve you &s;o? In a family, every individual might to con&s;ult the welfare of the whole, in&s;tead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f his own &s;atisfaction.

Dicky was quite confounded and immediately hopped away, if po&s;&s;ible to find &s;omething for his brother and &s;i&s;ter, that he might regain their good opinion.</P>
<P>In the mean while Robin found a caterpillar, which he intended to take for Peck&s;y; but ju&s;t as he was going to pick it up, a Linnet, who had a ne&s;t in the orchard, &s;natched it from him and flew away with. Inflamed with the mo&s;t furious rage. Robin ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nced to his father, and entreated he would fly after the Linnet and tear his heart out. That would be taking violent revenge indeed, &s;ays his father. No, Robin, the linnet has as great a right to the caterpillar as you or I; and in all pro|bability. has many little gaping mouths at home ready to receive it. But, however this may be, I had, for my own part, rather &s;u&s;tain an injury than take revenge. You mu&s;t expect to have many a &s;cramble of this kind in your life; but if you give way to a re&s;entful temper, you will do your&s;elf more harm than all the enemies in the world can do you; for you will be in perpetual agitation from an idea, that every one who does not act in direct conformity to your wi&s;hes, has a de&s;ign again&s;t you. Therefore, re&s;train your anger that you may be

happy; for believe me, peace and tranquility are the mo&s;t valuable things you can po&s;&s;e&s;s. At this in&s;tant Peck&s;y came with a fine fat &s;pider in her mouth, which &s;he laid at her mother's feet, and thus addre&s;&s;ed her: Accept, my dear parent, the fir&s;t tribute of gratitude which I have ever been able to offer you. How have I formerly longed to ea&s;e tho&s;e toils which you and my dear father endured for our &s;akes; and gladly would I now relea&s;e you from farther fatigue on my account, but I am &s;till a poor unexperienced creature, and mu&s;t continue to take &s;helter under your wing. All my power to a&s;&s;i&s;t you &s;hall however be exerted, and I will hop as long as I am able to procure provi&s;ions for the fa|mily. The eyes of the mother &s;parkled with de|light; and knowing that Peck&s;y's love by a refu&s;al would be di&s;appointed &s;he eat the &s;pider, which the dutiful ne&s;tling had &s;o affectionately brought her, and then &s;aid&mdash;How happy would families be, if every one like you, my dear Peck&s;y, con&s;ulted the the happine&s;s of the re&s;t, in&s;tead of turning their whole attention to their own intere&s;t. Dicky was not pre&s;ent at this &s;peech, which he mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ht have con|&s;idered as a reflection on his conduct; but he arri|ved as it was ended, and pre&s;ented Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k&s;y with a worm, like tho&s;e he had him&s;elf &s;o greedily eaten.

<P>The young Redbrea&s;ts &s;oon after all collected to|gether near the gate which led into the meadow, when they were &s;uddenly alarmed with a repetition of the &s;ame noi&s;es which had formerly &s;o terrified them in the ne&s;t; and Robin, who was foremo&s;t be|held to his very great amazement, Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;s Ben&s;on, the maid who attended them, and Joe the gardener, who having opened the gate, was, at the reque&s;t of his young Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, con|ducting to the ivy wall. Robin, with all his courage, and indeed he was not deficient in this qualification was &s;eized with a great tremor; for if the view he had of the face of the&s;e per&s;ons had appeared &s;o dread|ful to him as he &s;at in the ne&s;t, what mu&s;t it now be, to behold their full &s;ize, and &s;ee them advancing with he thought, gigantic &s;trides, towards him! He expec|ted nothing le&s;s than to be cru&s;hed to death with the foot of one of them; and not yet having attain|ed his full &s;trength, and never having rai&s;ed him&s;elf in the air, he knew not how to e&s;cape; therefore chirped &s;o loudly, as not only to &s;urprize his bro|ther and &s;i&s;ters, and bring his father and mother to enquire the meaning of his cry, but al&s;o to at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

Mi&s;s Ben&s;on followed her brother's ex|ample, and delighted the little flock with a &s;ight of her benign countenance. She heartily lamented having nothing with which to regale her old favour|ites and their family, when Frederick produced from his pocket a piece of bi&s;cuit which they crumbled and &s;cattered. Mi&s;s Ben&s;on recollecting that her mamma would expect her at home, and that the birds in the ba&s;ket would be hungry, per&s;uaded her brother to take up his little load and return; they therefore left the Redbrea&s;ts enjoying the fruits of their bounty.</P>

<P>WHEN the happy birds had &s;hared among&s;t them the acceptable pre&s;ent made by their young benefactors, the mother reminded her mate that it would be proper to think of returning to the ne&s;t. If the little ones fatigue them&s;elves too much with hopping about, &s;aid &s;he, their &s;trength will be ex|hau&s;ted, and they will not be able to fly back&middot; True, my love, replied her mate, gather them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nder your wings a little, as there is no rea&s;on to apprehend danger here, and then we will &s;ee what they can do. She complied with his de&s;ire, and when they were &s;ufficiently re&s;ted, got up, on which the whole brood in&s;tantly rai&s;ed them&s;elves on their feet. Now Robin, cried the father, let us &s;ee your dexterity at flying; come, I will &s;hew you how to rai&s;e your&s;elf, O! you need not take that trouble, &s;aid the conceited bird, as I flew down, I warant I know how to fly up: then &s;pread|ing his wings, he attempted to ri&s;e, but in &s;o un|&s;kilful a manner, that he only &s;huffled along upon the ground. That will not do, however, cried the father, &s;hall I &s;hew you now? Robin, per&s;i&s;ted in it that he &s;tood in no need of in&s;truction, and tried again; he managed to rai&s;e him&s;elf a little way, but
<PB N="89" REF="027817_0088_0FD64E7BD3E87750">
&s;oon tumbled headlong. His mother then began reproving him for his ob&s;tinacy, and advi&s;ed him to accept his father's kind offer of teaching him. You may depend on it, Robin, &s;aid &s;he, that he is in e|very re&s;pect wi&s;er than you, and as he has had &s;o much practice, he mu&s;t of cour&s;e be expert in the art of flying; and if you per&s;i&s;t in making your own fooli&s;h experiments, you will only commit a num|ber of errors, and make your&s;elf rediculous; I &s;hould commend your courage, provided you would add prudence to it; but blundering on in this ignorant manner, is only ra&s;hne&s;s. Let him alone, let him alone, &s;aid the father; if he is above being taught he may find his own way to the ne&s;t, I will teach his brother. Come, &s;aid he, Dicky, let us &s;ee what you can do at flying upwards, you cut a noble figure this morning when you flew down. Dicky, with reluctance, advanced; he &s;aid he did not &s;ee what occa&s;ion they had to go back to the ne&s;t at all; he &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e they might ea&s;ily find &s;ome corner to creep into, till they were &s;trong enough to roo&s;t in trees, as other birds did. Why you, &s;aid the fa|ther, are as ridiculous with your timidity, as Ro|bin with his conceitedne&s;s. Tho&s;e who give way to groundle&s;s fears, generally expo&s;e them&s;elves to real dangers; if you re&s;t on the earth all night, you will &s;uffer a great deal from cold and damp, and may very likely be devoured whil&s;t you &s;leep, by
<PB N="90" REF="027817_0089_0FD64E8061106AA0">
rats and other creatures that go out in the night to &s;eek for food; whereas, if you determine to go back to the ne&s;t, you have but one effort to make; for which, I will venture to &s;ay, you have a &s;uffi|cient degree of &s;trength, and then you will lie warm, &s;afe, and quiet&punc; however, do as you will. Dicky began to think it was his intere&s;t to obey his father, and &s;aid he would endeavour to fly up, but was &s;till fearful he &s;hould not be able to effect it. Never de&s;pair, replied his father, of doing what others have done before you. Turn your eyes upwards, and behold what numbers of birds are at this in|&s;tant &s;oaring in the air. They were once all ne&s;t|lings, like your&s;elf. See there that new-fledged Wren, with what courage he &s;kims along? Let it not be &s;aid, that a Redbrea&s;t lies groveling on the earth, whil&s;t a Wren &s;oars above him! Dicky was now a&s;hamed of him&s;elf, and in&s;pired with emulati|on: therefore, without delay, &s;pread his wings and his tail; his father with plea&s;ure placed him|&s;elf in a proper attitude before him, then ri&s;ing from the ground, led the way, and Dicky, by care|fully following his example, &s;afely arrived at the ne&s;t, which he found a mo&s;t comfortable re&s;ting place after the fatigue of the morning, and rejoiced that he had a good father to teach him what was mo&s;t conducive to his welfare.</P>
<P>The father having &s;een him &s;afe home, returned
<PB N="91" REF="027817_0090_0FD64E815A8D0AF8">
to his mate, who during his &s;hort ab&s;ence, had been endeavouring to convince Robin of his fault, but to no purpo&s;e; he did not like to be taught, what he &s;till per&s;uaded him&s;elf he could do by his own exer|tions; &s;he therefore applied her&s;elf to Flap&s;y. Come my dear, &s;aid &s;he, get ready to follow me when your father returns, for the &s;un ca&s;ts a great heat here, and the ne&s;t will be quite comfortable to you. Flap&s;y dreaded the experiment; however, as &s;he could not but blame both Robin's and Dicky's con|duct, &s;he re&s;olved to do her be&s;t; but entreated her mother to inform her very particularly how to proceed. Well then, &s;aid the tender parent, ob|&s;erve me. Fir&s;t bend your legs, then &s;pring from the ground as quick as you can, &s;tretching your wings as you ri&s;e, &s;traight out on each &s;ide of your body; &s;hake them with a quick motion, as you will &s;ee me do, and the air will yield to you, and at the &s;ame time &s;upport your weight; which ever way you want to turn, &s;trike the air with the wing on the contrary &s;ide, and that will bring you about. She then ro&s;e from the ground, and having practi&s;|ed two or three times repeatedly, what &s;he had been teaching, Flap&s;y at length ventured to follow her, but with a palpitating heart; and was &s;oon happily &s;eated in the ne&s;t by the &s;ide of Dicky, who rejoiced that his favourite &s;i&s;ter was &s;afely arrived.</P>
<P>The mother bird now went back to Peck&s;y, who
<PB N="92" REF="027817_0091_0FD64E8319481F48">
was waiting with her father till &s;he returned; for the good-parent cho&s;e to leave the female part of his family to the particular management of their mother. Peck&s;y was fully prepared for her flight, for &s;he had attentively ob&s;erved the in&s;truction given to the others, and al&s;o their errors; &s;he therefore kept the happy medium betwixt &s;elf-con|ceit and timidity, indulging that moderated emula|tion, which ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s every young heart; and re&s;olving that neither her inferiors nor equals &s;hould &s;oar about her, &s;he &s;prang from the ground, and with a &s;teadine&s;s and agility, wonderful for her fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, followed her mother to the ne&s;t, who now re&s;ted her&s;elf, waiting with impatience for the arrival of Robin and her mate; but Robin di&s;ap|pointed her hopes, for he &s;at &s;ulky; though con|vinced that he had been in the wrong, he would not humble him&s;elf to his father; who therefore re&s;olved to leave him a little while, taking his &s;tand, however, on a adjoining tree that he might be at hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t him &s;hould he repent of his folly: as &s;oon as Robin found him&s;elf de&s;erted, in&s;tead of being &s;orry, he gave way to anger and re&s;entment; &mdash;Why, cried he, am I to be treated in this manner, who am the elde&s;t of the family, whil&s;t all the lit|tle darlings are fondled and carre&s;&s;ed? but I don't care, I can get to the ne&s;t yet, I make no doubt; he then attempted to fly, and after a great many
<PB N="93" REF="027817_0092_0FD64E840E527548">
trials, at length got up in the air, but knew not which way to direct his cour&s;e; and &s;ometimes turned to the right, and &s;ometimes to the left; now he advanced forwards a little, and now, fearing he was wrong, came back again: at length quite &s;pent with fatigue, he fell to the ground and brui&s;ed him&s;elf a good deal; &s;tunned with the fall, he lay for &s;ome minutes without &s;en&s;e or motion, but &s;oon revived; and finding him&s;elf alone in this di&s;mal condition, the horrors of his &s;ituation filled him with dreadful apprehen&s;ions, and the bittere&s;t re|mor&s;e. Oh! cried he, that I had but followed the advice and example of my tender parents, then had I been &s;afe in the ne&s;t, ble&s;t with their kind care&s;&s;es, and enjoying the company of my dear brother and &s;i&s;ters! but now I am of all birds, the mo&s;t wretch|ed! never &s;hall I be able to fly, for every joint of me has received a &s;hock which I doubt it will not recover. Where &s;hall I find &s;helter from the &s;corch|ing &s;un, who&s;e piercing rays already render the ground I lie on intolerably hot? What kind beak will &s;upply me with food to a&s;&s;uage the pangs of hunger which I &s;hall &s;oon feel? By what means &s;hall I procure even a drop of water to quench that thir&s;t which &s;o frequently returns? Who will pro|tect me from the various tribes of barbarous animals which I have been told make a prey of birds? Oh! my dear, my tender mother, if the &s;ound of my
<PB N="94" REF="027817_0093_0FD76EA7337F9800">
voice can reach your ears, pity my condition, and fly to my &s;uccour. The kind parent waited not for farther &s;olicitation, but darting from the branch on which &s;he had been a painful eye-witne&s;s of Robin's fall, &s;he in&s;tantly &s;tood before him. I have li&s;tened, &s;aid &s;he, to your lamentations; and &s;ince you &s;eem convinced of your error, will not add to your &s;uf|fering by my reproaches; my heart relents to|wards you, and gladly would I afford you all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power: but alas! I can do but lit|tle for your relief; however, let me per&s;uade you, to exert all the &s;trength you have, and u&s;e every effort for your own pre&s;ervation; I will endeavour to procure you &s;ome refre&s;hment, and at the &s;ame time contrive means of fixing you in a place of more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecurity and comfort, than that in which you at pre&s;ent lie. So &s;aying, &s;he flew to a little &s;tream which flowed in an adjacent meadow, and fetched from the brink of it, a worm which &s;he had ob&s;erv|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> angler to drop as &s;he perched on the tree; with this &s;he immediately returned to the penitent Robin, who received the welcome gift with grati|tude. Refre&s;hed with this delicious mor&s;el, and comforted by his mother's kindne&s;s, he was able to &s;tand up, and on &s;haking his wings, found that he was not &s;o greatly hurt as he apprehended; his head, indeed, was brui&s;ed, &s;o that one eye was al|mo&s;t clo&s;ed, and he had injured the joint of one
<PB N="95" REF="027817_0094_0FD76EA5B659BDF8">
wing &s;o that he could not po&s;&s;ibly fly: however, he could manage to hop, and the parent bird ob|&s;erving that Joe the gardener was cutting a haw|thorn hedge, which was near the &s;pot, de&s;ired Ro|bin to follow her; this he did, tho' with great pain. Now, &s;aid &s;he, look carefully about, and you will &s;oon find in&s;ects of one kind or another for your &s;u&s;tenance, during the remainder of the day, and before evening I will return to you again. Summon all your courage, for I make no doubt you will be &s;afe whil&s;t our friend continues his work, as none of tho&s;e creatures which are enimies to birds will venture to come near him. Robin took a &s;orrowful farewel, and the mother flew to the ne&s;t. You have been ab&s;ent a long time, my love, &s;aid her mate, but I perceived that you were in|dulging your tenderne&s;s towards that di&s;obedient ne&s;tling, who has rendered him&s;elf unworthy of it; however, I do not condemn you for giving him a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, for had not you undertaken the ta&s;k, I would my&s;elf have flown to him, in&s;tead of return|ing home; how is he, likely to live and reward your kindne&s;s? Yes, &s;aid &s;he, he will, I flatter my&s;elf, &s;oon perfectly recover, for his hurt is not very con&s;iderable; and I have the plea&s;ure to tell you, he is extremely &s;en&s;ible of his late folly, and I dare &s;ay will endeavour to repair his fault with future good behaviour: this is plea&s;ing news indeed

&s;aid he. The little ne&s;tlings delighted to hear their dear brother &s;afe, and convinced of his error; ex|pre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t joy and &s;atisfaction, and entreat|ed their father to let them de&s;cend again to keep him company; to this he would by no means con|&s;ent, becau&s;e, as he told them, the fatigue would be too great; and it was proper that Robin &s;hould feel a little longer the con&s;equences of his pre&s;ump|tion: to-morrow, &s;aid he, you &s;hall pay him a vi&s;it, but to-day he mu&s;t be by him&s;elf: on this they dropped their reque&s;t, knowing that their pa|rent was the be&s;t judge what was proper to be done; and not doubting, but that his affection would lead him to every thing that was conducive to the real happine&s;s of his family: but yet they could not tell how to be happy without Robin, and were con|tinually perking up their little heads, fancying they heard his cries; both the father and mother frequently took a peep at him, and had the &s;atis|faction of &s;eeing him very &s;afe by their friend Joe the gardner.

<P>THIS happy pair arrived at the hou&s;e &s;oon after they left the Redbrea&s;ts, and communicated every circum&s;tance of their expedition to their kind

mamma; who hearing their little pri&s;oners in the ba&s;ket chirp very loudly, de&s;ired they would imme|diately go and feed them; which they gladly did, and then took a &s;hort le&s;&s;on. Mrs. Ben&s;on told Mi&s;s Harriet that &s;he was going to make a vi&s;it in the afternoon, and &s;hould take her with her, there|fore de&s;ired &s;he would keep her&s;elf quite &s;till, that &s;he might not be fatigued after the walk &s;he had had in the morning; for though &s;he meant to go in the coach, it was her intention to return on foot, as the weather was &s;o remarkably fine. The young lady took great care of the birds, and Frederick engaged, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the maid, to feed them during her ab&s;ence. Mi&s;s Ben&s;on was then dre&s;&s;ed to attend her mamma. Mrs. Addis, to who&s;e hou&s;e they were going, was a widow lady; &s;he had two children, Ma&s;ter Charles a boy of twelve years old at &s;chool, and Mi&s;s Augu&s;ta about &s;even at home. But the&s;e children were quite &s;trangers to Mi&s;s Ben&s;on. On entering the hall, the young lady took notice of a very di&s;agreeable &s;mell, and was &s;urpri&s;ed with the appearance of a parrot, a paroquet, and a macaw, all in mo&s;t elegant cages. In the next room &s;he came to, were a &s;quirrel and a monkey, which had each a little hou&s;e neatly or|namented.</P>
<P>On being introduced into the drawing-room &s;he
<PB N="98" REF="027817_0097_0FD64E8BDF9E0E20">
ob&s;erved in one corner a lap dog lying on a &s;plendid cu&s;hion; and in a beautiful little cradle, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to contain a large wax doll, lay, in great &s;tate, a cat with a litter of kittens. In vain did Mi&s;s Harriet look for Mrs. Addis's children, for nei|ther of them appeared. After the u&s;ual compli|ments of &s;alutation were over, I have, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, taken the liberty of bringing my daughter with me, madam, in hopes of inducing you to fa|vour us in return, with the company of Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;s Addis. You are very obliging, Madam, an|&s;wered the lady; but indeed I never take my chil|dren with me, they are &s;o rude; on the contrary, I am obliged to keep the boy almo&s;t continually at &s;chool, for he is &s;o cruel to my dear little precious creatures, that there is no bearing him at home; and as for Augu&s;ta, it will be time enough &s;ome years hence for her to go a vi&s;iting. I am &s;orry to hear you &s;ay this, madam, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, but hope my daughter will at lea&s;t be indulged with &s;eeing Mi&s;s Addis to-day, or I &s;hall think you are di&s;plea&s;ed at my bringing Harriet here. This in reality was the ca&s;e, and Mrs. Ben&s;on percieved it, for the lady looked very cro&s;s; however, &s;he could not refu&s;e having her daughter come into the draw|ing room, as her gue&s;t &s;o particularly de&s;ired it. Mi&s;s Harriet was very curious to examine the vari|us animals which were collected together by this

extraordinary lady; but as her mamma never &s;uf|fered her to run about when &s;he accompanied her to other people's hou&s;es, &s;he &s;at down and kept quite &s;till, only glancing her eye fir&s;t to one part of the room, and then to the other, as her attention was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively attracted. Mrs. Addis rang the bell, and ordered that Augu&s;ta might come to her. The footman, who had never before received &s;uch a command, (for Mrs. Addis only &s;aw the child in the nur&s;ery) &s;tared with a&s;toni&s;hment, and thought he had mi&s;taken it. However, on his mi&s;tre&s;s's re|peating, "that the little girl was to be brought down," he went to tell the nur&s;ery-maid to take her. What new fancy is this? &s;aid &s;he, Who would ever have thought of <HI>her</HI> wanting the <HI>child in the drawing-room?</HI> I have no &s;tockings clean for her, not a frock to put on but what is all to pieces; I wi&s;h &s;he would &s;pend le&s;s on her <HI>cats,</HI> and <HI>dogs,</HI> and <HI>monkies,</HI> and then her <HI>child</HI> might appear as &s;he ought to do. I won't go up &s;tairs, Nancy, &s;aid the child, mamma is &s;o cro&s;s to me. But you <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> &s;aid Nancy; be&s;ides, there is a pretty young lady come to &s;ee you; and if you will go like a good girl, you &s;hall have a piece of &s;ugar'd bread and butter for your &s;upper, and you &s;hall carry the doll which your good-mamma gave you, to &s;hew your little vi&s;itor. The&s;e bribes had the de&s;ired effect,
<PB N="100" REF="027817_0099_0FD64EDC36648B98">
and Mi&s;s Augu&s;ta went into the drawing-room; but in&s;tead of entering it like a young lady, with a genteel curt&s;ey, &s;he &s;topped at the door, hung down her head, and looked like a little &s;impleton. Mi&s;s Ben&s;on was &s;o &s;urprized at her awkwardne&s;s&punc; that &s;he did not know what to do, and looked at her mamma; who &s;aid, Harriet, my love, can't you take the little lady by the hand and lead her to me? I believe &s;he is afraid of &s;trangers. On this Mi&s;s Harriet aro&s;e to do &s;o; but Augu&s;ta, ap|prehen&s;ive that &s;he would &s;natch her doll away, was going to run out, only &s;he was not able to open the door. Mrs Ben&s;on was quite &s;hocked to &s;ee how &s;ickly, dirty, and ragged this child was, and what a very vulgar figure &s;he made, for want of in&s;truc|tion; but Mrs. Addis was &s;o taken up at that in|&s;tant with the old lap-dog, which had, as &s;he thought, fallen into a fit, that &s;he did not mind her entrance; and before &s;he perceived it, the child went up to the cradle in order to put her doll into it; and &s;eized one of the kittens by the neck, the &s;queaking of which, provoked the old cat to &s;cratch her, and this made her cry and drop the kitten on the floot. Mrs. Addis &s;eeing this, flew to the little bea&s;t, endeavoured to &s;ooth it with care&s;&s;es, and
<PB N="101" REF="027817_0100_0FD625927366DBF8">
was going to beat Augu&s;ta for touching it, but Mrs. Ben&s;on interceded for her; though &s;he could &s;carce|ly gain attention, Mrs. Addis being &s;o greatly agitated. Tea was now ordered, and Mi&s;s Augu&s;ta being urgent to go to her maid, Mrs. Ben&s;on thought it be&s;t &s;he &s;hould be indulged; and therefore &s;aid, &s;he was &s;ure Harriet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t de&s;ire to detain her again&s;t her inclinations: and Augu&s;ta was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by her mamma, without &s;o much as one tender ki&s;s or kind expre&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>The tea things being &s;et, the footman came in with the urn, which employing both his hands, he left the door open; and was, to the great terror of Mi&s;s Harriet, and even of her mamma too, fol|lowed by the monkey they &s;aw in the hall, who hav|ing broke his chain, came to make a vi&s;it to his lady: &s;he, far from being di&s;concerted, &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed with his cleverne&s;s. O my &s;weet dear p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g, &s;aid &s;he, are you come to &s;ee us? Pray &s;hew how like a gentleman you can behave: ju&s;t as &s;he had &s;aid this, he leaped upon the tea-table, and took cup after cup, and threw them on the ground, till he broke half the &s;et; then jumped on the back of his mi&s;tre&s;s's chair, and tore the cover
<PB N="102" REF="027817_0101_0FD64EAB5E6422D8">
of it; in &s;hort, as &s;oon as he had fini&s;hed one piece of mi&s;chief, he began another; till Mrs. Addis' though va&s;tly diverted with his wit, was obliged to to have him caught and confined; after which &s;he began making tea, and quietne&s;s was for a &s;hort time re&s;tored. But Mrs. Ben&s;on, though capable of conver&s;ing on mo&s;t &s;ubjects, could not engage Mrs. Addis in any di&s;cour&s;e, but upon the perfec|tions of her birds and bea&s;ts; and a variety of un|intere&s;ting particulars were related, concerning their wit or misfortunes. On hearing the clock &s;trike &s;even, &s;he begged Mrs. Ben&s;ons's excu&s;e; but &s;aid &s;he made it a con&s;tant rule, to &s;ee all her dear darlings fed at that hour, and entreated that &s;he and the young lady would take a turn in the garden in the mean-while. This was very unpolite, but Mrs. Ben&s;on de&s;ired &s;he would u&s;e no ceremonies with her, and was really glad of the re&s;pite it gave her from company &s;o irk&s;ome: and Mi&s;s Harriet was happy to be alone with her mamma: &s;he, however, forbore to make any remarks on Mrs. Addis, be|cau&s;e &s;he had been taught, that it did not become young per&s;ons to cen&s;ure the behaviour of tho&s;e who were older than them&s;elves. The garden was &s;pacious, but overrun with weeds; the gravel-walks
<PB N="103" REF="027817_0102_0FD64EAE6B282C08">
were &s;o rough for want of rolling, that it was quite painful to tread on them: and the gra&s;s on the lawn &s;o long, that there was no walking with any comfort, for the gardner was almo&s;t continually going on &s;ome errand or another for Mrs. Addis's darlings; &s;o Mrs. Ben&s;on and her daughter &s;at down on a garden-&s;eat, with an intention of waiting there till Mrs. Addis &s;hould &s;ummon them. Mi&s;s Harriet could not refrain from expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h that it was time to go home; to which Mrs. Ben&s;on replied, that &s;he did not wonder at her de&s;ire to return, but, &s;aid &s;he, my dear, as the world was not made merely for us, we mu&s;t endeavour to be patient un|der every di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance we meet with. I know what opinion you have formed of Mrs. Ad|dis, and &s;hould not have brought you to be a &s;pec|tator of her follies, had I not hoped that an hour or two pa&s;&s;ed in her company would afford you a le&s;&s;on which might be u&s;eful to you through life. I have before told you, that our affections towards the inferior parts of the creation &s;hould be properly <HI>regulated;</HI> you have, in your friend Mi&s;s Jenkins and her brother, &s;een in&s;tances of cruelty to them, which I am &s;ure you will never be inclined to imi|tate; but I was apprehen&s;ive you might fall into
<PB N="104" REF="027817_0103_0FD64EB0A398BF48">
the contrary extreme, which is equally blameable. Mrs. Addis you &s;ee, has ab&s;olutely transferred the affection &s;he ought to feel for her child, to crea|tures who would really be happier without it. As for pu&s;s who lies in the cradle in all her &s;plendor, I will engage to &s;ay, &s;he would pa&s;s her time plea|&s;anter in a ba&s;ket of clean &s;traw, placed in a &s;ituation where &s;he could occa&s;ionally amu&s;e her&s;elf with catching mice. The lap dog is, I am &s;ure, a mi|&s;erable object, full of de&s;ea&s;es, the con&s;equences of luxurious living. How enviable is the lot of a &s;paniel, that is at liberty to be the companion of his ma&s;ter's walks, when compared with his! Mr. Pug I am certain would enjoy him&s;elf much more in his native wood. And I am greatly mi&s;taken, if the parrots, &amp;c. have not cau&s;e to wi&s;h them&s;elves in their re&s;pective countries, or at lea&s;t divided in|to &s;eparate families, where they would be better attended; for Mrs. Addis, by having &s;uch a number of creatures, has put it out of her power to &s;ee pro|perly with her own eyes to all. But come, let us go back into the hou&s;e, the time for our going home draws near, and I wi&s;h not to prolong my vi&s;it. Saying this &s;he aro&s;e, and with her daughter went into the the drawing room, which opened into the garden; the other door which led to the adjoining apartments was not &s;hut, and gave them an oppor|tunity of hearing what really di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mrs. Ben&s;on,
<PB N="105" REF="027817_0104_0FD64EB223FD45A8">
and perfectly terrified the gentle Harriet. "Be gone, wretch," &s;ays Mrs. Addis, "be gone this in&s;tant, you &s;hall not &s;tay a moment longer in this hou&s;e." "I hope, Madam, you will have the goodne&s;s to give me a character; indeed and in|deed, I fed Poll, but I believe he got cold when you let him &s;tand out of doors the other day." "I will give you no character I tell you, &s;o depart this in&s;tant. Oh my poor, dear, dear creature! I fear you will never recover; John, Thom, here run this in&s;tant to Perkins the bird-catcher, perhaps he can tell me what to give him;" then bur&s;ting into a flood of tears, &s;he &s;at down and forgot her gue&s;ts&punc; Mrs. Ben&s;on thought it nece&s;&s;ary to remind her, that &s;he was in the hou&s;e, and &s;tepped to the door to a&s;k what was the matter. Mrs. Addis recollect|ed her&s;elf &s;ufficiently, to beg pardon for neglecting to pay attention to her, but declared, that the dreadful misfortune that had befallen her, had made her in&s;en&s;ible to every thing el&s;e. What can the matter be? &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on. Have you heard of the death of a dear friend; has your child met with an accident! Oh! no, &s;aid &s;he, but dear Poll is taken &s;uddenly ill; my dear Poll which I have had the&s;e &s;even years, and I fear he never will re|cover. If this is all, madam, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, I really cannot pity you, nor excu&s;e your behaviour to me: for it is an in&s;tance of di&s;re&s;pect which I be|lieve
<PB N="106" REF="027817_0105_0FD64EB528C55120">
no other per&s;on but your&s;elf would &s;hew me, and I &s;hall take my leave of your hou&s;e for ever: but before I go, permit me to &s;ay, that you act in a very wrong manner, and will certainly feel the ill effects of your inju&s;tice to your fellow-creatures, in thus robbing them of the love you owe them, to lavi&s;h it away on tho&s;e who are really &s;ufferers by your kindne&s;s. At this in&s;tant the footman enter|ed to inform Mrs. Ben&s;on that her &s;ervant was come, on which, accompanied by Mi&s;s Harriet, &s;he, with|out further ceremony, left Mrs. Addis to compo&s;e her&s;elf as &s;he could.</P>
<P>As they walked along, both Mrs. Ben&s;on and her daughter continued &s;ilent, for the former was great|ly agitated, and the latter quite in con&s;ternation at what had lately pa&s;&s;ed, but their attention was &s;oon awakened by the &s;upplication of a poor wo|man, who entreated them to give her &s;ome relief, as &s;he had a &s;ick hu&s;band and &s;even children in a &s;tarving condition; of which, &s;he &s;aid they might be eye-witne&s;&s;es, if they would have the goodne&s;s to &s;tep into a barn hard by. The invitation of wretchedne&s;s never was given in vain to Mrs. Ben|&s;on: her heart was ever awake to the tender feel|ings of humanity; and taking her daughter by the hand, and de&s;iring the &s;ervant to &s;top for her, &s;he followed the woman, who conducted her to the man&s;ions of real woe, where &s;he beheld a father,
<PB N="107" REF="027817_0106_0FD64EBA9E568E48">
&s;urrounded with his helple&s;s family, whom he could no longer &s;upply with &s;u&s;tenance; and he him&s;elf, though his di&s;ea&s;e was &s;ubdued, was almo&s;t on the point of expiring, for want of &s;ome reviving cor|dial. How come you to be in this condition, good woman? &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on to his wife, &s;urely you might have obtained relief before your hu&s;band was reduced to &s;uch extremity? Oh! my good Lady, &s;aid the woman, we have not been u&s;ed to beg, but to earn an hone&s;t livelihood by our indu&s;t|ry: and never till this &s;ad day, have I known what it was to a&s;k charity: and the fir&s;t time I could bring my&s;elf to do it, I made application at the only great hou&s;e in this village, where I made no doubt there was abundance. I told my di&s;mal tale to a &s;ervant, and begged &s;he would make it known to her mi&s;tre&s;s; but &s;he a&s;&s;ured me it was in vain to come there, for her Lady had &s;uch a family of cats, dogs, monkies, and all &s;orts of creatures, that &s;he had nothing to &s;pare for poor people; at the &s;ame in&s;tant I &s;aw a poulterer bring a rabbit and a fowl, which I found were for the favourite cat and dog. This di&s;couraged me from begging; and I had determined to die before I would a&s;k again; but the &s;ight of my dear hu&s;band and child|ren in this condition, drives me to it. Well, com|fort your&s;elf, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, I will take care of you all. Come to my hou&s;e to-morrow morning.
<PB N="108" REF="027817_0107_0FD64ECF669E1BC0">
and we will &s;ee what we can do; in the mean time here is &s;omething for a pre&s;ent &s;upply. Mrs. Ben|&s;on then departed, as &s;he was fearful of walking late. Mi&s;s Harriet was greatly affected with this &s;cene, and could no longer help exclaiming again&s;t Mrs. Addis. She is de&s;erving of great blame, in|deed, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on; but I have the plea&s;ure to &s;ay, &s;uch characters as her's are very uncommon, I mean in the extreme; though there are numbers of people who fall into the &s;ame fault in &s;ome degree, and make them&s;elves truly ridiculous with their un|natural affections. I wi&s;h you, whil&s;t your mind is young, to guard it again&s;t &s;uch a blamable weak|ne&s;s. Mi&s;s Harriet a&s;&s;ured her mamma, that &s;he &s;hould never forget either Mrs. Addis or the le&s;&s;on &s;he had received on the &s;ubject, and then expre&s;&s;ed her &s;atisfaction that they had met the poor woman. I rejoice &s;incerely, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, that I was fortunate enough to be in time to a&s;&s;i&s;t this poor wretched family, and hope, my love, you will out of your own little pur&s;e, contribute &s;omething to-morrow towards their relief. Mo&s;t willingly, &s;aid Harriet, they &s;hall be welcome to my whole &s;tore. They kept taking on this &s;ubject till they arrived at home. Little Frederick, who &s;at up an hour beyond his time, came out to meet them, and a&s;|&s;ured his &s;i&s;ter that the birds were well and fa&s;t a&s;leep. I think, &s;aid &s;he, it is time for you and I
<PB N="109" REF="027817_0108_0FD64EBD63773170">
to follow their example; for my part, with my morning and evening walk together, I am really tired, &s;o &s;hall beg leave to wi&s;h you a good night, my dear mamma; papa, I &s;uppo&s;e will not be at home this week. No, my dear, nor the next, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, for he has many affairs to &s;ettle in the We&s;t. I am rather fatigued al&s;o, and &s;hall &s;oon retire to re&s;t.</P>

<P>WE will now return to Robin, whom we left under the protection of Joe the gardener, though the hono&s;t fellow did not know of his guar|dian&s;hip, and continued his work without perceiv|ing the little cripple, who hopped and &s;huffled about, pecking here and there whatever he could meet with. When he had been for &s;ome time by him&s;elf, his mother made him another vi&s;it, and told him &s;he had interceded with his father, who&s;e anger was abated, and he would come to him be|fore he went to re&s;t. Robin rejoiced to hear that there was a chance of his being reconciled to his father, yet he dreaded the fir&s;t interview; however, as it mu&s;t be, he wi&s;hed to have it over as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and every wing he heard beat the air, he fancied to be that of his offended parent. In this
<PB N="110" REF="027817_0109_0FD64EBFB11ACD00">
&s;tate of anxious expectation he continued almo&s;t to the time of &s;un-&s;etting, when, of a &s;udden, he heard the well-known voice to which he u&s;ed to li&s;ten with joy, but which now cau&s;ed his whole frame to tremble; but ob&s;erving a beam of benignity in that eye, in which he looked for anger and reproach, he ca&s;t him&s;elf in the mo&s;t &s;upplicating po&s;ture at the feet of his father, who could no longer re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire he felt to receive him into &s;avour. Your pre&s;ent humility, Robin, &s;aid he, di&s;arms my re|&s;entment; I gladly pronounce your pardon, and am per&s;uaded you will never again incur my di&s;plea&s;ure; we will therefore &s;ay no more on a &s;ubject which gives &s;o much pain to both of us. Yes, my dear, my too indulgent father, cried Robin, permit me to make my grateful acknowledgements for your kindne&s;s, and to a&s;&s;ure you of my future obedience. The delighted parent accepted his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and the reconciliation was compleated. Robin now felt him&s;elf greatly relieved; but on his father's a&s;king him what he intended to do with him&s;elf at night, his &s;pirits &s;unk again, and he an&s;wered, He did not know. Well, &s;aid the father, I have thought of an expedient to &s;ecure you from cold at lea&s;t. In a part of the orchard, a very little way from hence, there is a place belonging to our friend the gar|dener; there I have &s;heltered my&s;elf from &s;everal &s;torms, and I am &s;ure it will afford you a comfort|able

lodging; &s;o follow me, before it is too late. The old bird then led the way, and his lame &s;on followed him; when they arrived they found the door of the tool-hou&s;e open, and as the thre&s;hold was low, Robin managed to get over it. His fa|ther looked carefully about, and at la&s;t found, in a corner, a parcel of &s;hreds, kept for the purpo&s;e of nailing up trees. Here, Robin, cried he, is a charming bed for you, let me &s;ee you in it, and call your mother to have a peep, and then I mu&s;t bid you good night; &s;o &s;aying away he flew, and brought his mate, who was perfectly &s;atisfied with the lodging, provided for her late undutiful, but now repentant &s;on; but reminded by her mate that if they &s;taid longer they might be &s;hut in, they took leave, telling Robin they would vi&s;it him early in the morning. Though this habitation was much better than Robin expected, and he was ready enough to own, better than he de&s;erved, yet he deeply re|gretted his ab&s;ence from the ne&s;t, and longed to &s;ee again his brother and &s;i&s;ters; however, though part of the night was &s;pent in bitter reflections, fatigue at length prevailed ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> anxiety, and he fell a&s;leep. The ne&s;tlings were greatly plea&s;ed to find that Robin was likely to e&s;cape the dangers of the night, and even the anxious mother at length re&s;igned her&s;elf to repo&s;e. Before the &s;un &s;hewed

his glorious face in the ea&s;t, every individual of this affectionate family were awake; the father with impatience waited for the gardener's opening the tool-hou&s;e&punc; the mother prepared her little ones for a new excur&s;ion. You will be able to de&s;cend with more ea&s;e, my dears, to-day, than you did ye&s;ter|day, &s;hall you not? O yes, mother, &s;aid Dicky, I &s;hall not be at all afraid; nor I, &s;aid Flap&s;y. Say you &s;o? then let us &s;ee which of you will be down fir&s;t. Come, I will &s;hew you the way.

There they found him in his &s;nug little bed: but who can de&s;cribe the happy meeting? who can find words to expre&s;s the raptures which filled every little bo&s;om? When the fir&s;t tran&s;ports &s;ub&s;ided, I think, &s;aid the father, it will be be&s;t to retire from hence; if our friend re|turns, he may take us for a &s;et of thieves, and &s;up|po&s;e that we came to eat his &s;eeds, and I &s;hould be &s;orry he &s;hould have an ill opinion of us.

brood: they accordingly left the tool-hou&s;e, and hopped about among the currant bu&s;hes. I think, &s;aid the father, that you who have the full u&s;e of your limbs, could manage to get up the&s;e low trees, but Robin mu&s;t content him&s;elf on the ground a little longer. This was very mortifying, but there was no one to blame excepting him&s;elf: &s;o he forbore to complain, and a&s;&s;umed as much cheerfulne&s;s as he could; his brother and &s;i&s;ters begged they might &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y with him all day, as they could do very well w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thout going up to the ne&s;t; to this the parents co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ted.</P>
<P>At the u&s;ual hour of vi&s;iting Mrs. Ben&s;on's tea|table, the affectionate pair took their morning's flight, and found the young Gentleman and Lady with their mamma. They had been up a long time for Frederick had made his bed chamber a lodging for the birds, who had awakened both him and his &s;i&s;ter at a very early hour, and they ro&s;e with great readine&s;s to perform the kind office they had impo|&s;ed on them&s;elves. The two blackbirds were per|fectly well, but the Linnet looked rather drooping, and they began to be apprehen&s;ive they &s;hould no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rai&s;e him, e&s;pecially when they found he was not inclined to eat. As for the blackbirds, they were very hungry indeed; and their young benefactors not con&s;idering that when fed by their parents,
<PB N="114" REF="027817_0113_0FD64EC843292C70">
young birds wait &s;ome time between every mor&s;el, &s;upplied them too fa&s;t, and filled the ircrops &s;o full, that they looked as if they had great wens on their necks; and Harriet perceived one of them ga&s;ping for breath. Stop, Frederick, &s;aid &s;he, as he was carrying the quil to its mouth, the bird is &s;o full he can hold no more; but &s;he &s;poke too late; the little creature gave its eyes a gha&s;tly roll, and fell on one &s;ide &s;uffocated with abundance. Oh! he is dead! he is dead! cried Frederick; he is indeed, &s;aid Mi&s;s Ben&s;on, but I am &s;ure we did not de&s;ign to kill him; but it is &s;ome &s;atisfaction to think we did not take the ne&s;t. This con&s;ideration was not enough to comfort Frederick, who began to cry mo&s;t bitterly. His mamma hearing him, was apprehen|&s;ive he had hurt him&s;elf, for he &s;eldom cried unle&s;s he was in great pain: &s;he therefore ha&s;tily entered the room to enquire what was the matter, on which Mi&s;s Harriet related the di&s;a&s;ter that had happened. Mrs. Ben&s;on then &s;at down, and taking Frederick in her lap, wiped his eyes, and giving him a ki&s;s, &s;aid, I am &s;orry, my love, for your di&s;appointment but do not afflict your&s;elf, the poor little thing is out of its pain now, and I fancy &s;uffered but for a &s;hort time. If you keep on crying &s;o, you will for|get to feed your flock of birds, which I fancy by the chirping I heard from my window, are begin|ing to a&s;&s;emble. Come, let me take the object of

of your di&s;tre&s;s out of your &s;ight, it mu&s;t be buried: then carrying the dead bird in one hand, and leading Frederick by the other, &s;he went down &s;tairs. Whil&s;t &s;he was &s;peaking, Mi&s;s Harriet had been watching the other Blackbird, which &s;he had &s;oon the plea&s;ure to &s;ee perfectly at his ea&s;e. She then attempted to feed the Linnet, but he would not eat. I fancy, Mi&s;s, &s;aid the maid, he wants air. That may be the ca&s;e indeed, replied Mi&s;s Ben&s;on; for you know, Betty, this room which has been &s;hut up all night, mu&s;t be much clo&s;er than the places birds build in. Saying this &s;he opened the window, and placed the Linnet near it, waiting to &s;ee the effect of the experiment, which an&s;wered her wi&s;hes, and &s;he was delighted to behold how the little crea|ture gradually &s;moothed his feathers, and his eyes re&s;umed their native lu&s;tre; &s;he once more offered him food, which he took, and was quite recovered. Having done all in her power for her little orphans, &s;he went to &s;hare with her brother the ta&s;k of feed|ing the daily pri&s;oners, which being ended, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf at the breakfa&s;t table by her mamma. I wonder, &s;aid Frederick, who had dried up his tears, that the Robins are not come. Con&s;ider, replied his &s;i&s;ter, that they have a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s to do, now their young ones begin to leave the ne&s;t: they will be here by and by, I make no doubt.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="027817_0115_0FD64ECCC48C2B58">Whil&s;t &s;he was &s;peaking the &s;ervant entered, and &s;aid the poor woman was at the gate, who was or|dered to attend there in the morning.

Thanks to your goodne&s;s, Madam, and the ble&s;&s;ing of God, quite cheery.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid the Lady, I am happy to find you in better &s;pirits than you were la&s;t night, and do not doubt you will do very well. I will order &s;ome meat and bread to be &s;ent you every day this week, and will al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t you in clothing the children. Harriet's eyes gli&s;tened with benevolence at &s;eeing the woman, who&s;e di&s;tre&s;s had &s;o greatly affected her, thus comforted; and &s;lipping her pur&s;e, which contained &s;even &s;hillings, into her mamma's hand, begged &s;he would take it for the woman. You &s;hall, my dear, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, have the plea&s;ure of relieving her your&s;elf, give this half-crown to her. Mi&s;s Harriet, with a delight which none but the compa&s;&s;ionate can know, extended the hand of cha|rity. The woman received her benefaction with grateful acknowledgments; and praying that the Almighty might &s;hower down his choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings on this worthy family, re&s;pectfully took leave and
<PB N="117" REF="027817_0116_0FD64ECDDED29060">
returned to her hu&s;band, who every hour gathered &s;trength.</P>
<P>She was &s;carce gone out of the room, when the Redbrea&s;ts entered, as I before related. The &s;ight of them perfectly re&s;tored Frederick's cheerfulne&s;s; and after they were departed he reque&s;ted his mam|ma, that he and Harriet might go again to the or|chard, in hopes of &s;eeing the young Robins. That you &s;hall do, Frederick, &s;aid &s;he, upon condition that you continue a very good boy; but as ye&s;ter|day was rather an idle day with you, you mu&s;t ap|ply a little clo&s;er to-day; and Harriet has a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s to do, therefore you mu&s;t wait till evening, and then perhaps I may go with you. Frederick was &s;atisfied with this promi&s;e, and took great pains to learn to read and &s;pell. He repeat|ed by heart all the hymns and other little things he had been taught; and Mi&s;s Ben&s;on applied her&s;elf to a variety of different le&s;&s;ons with great a&s;&s;idui|ty, and performed her ta&s;k of work entirely to her mamma's &s;atisfaction.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as the old Redbrea&s;ts left their little fa|mily, in order to go to Mr. Ben&s;on's, Peck&s;y, with great &s;olicitude, began to a&s;k Robin where he had
<PB N="118" REF="027817_0117_0FD64ED20910A208">
hurt him&s;elf, and how he did? Oh! &s;aid he, I am much better; but it is a wonder I am now alive, for you cannot think what a dreadful fall I had. With turning about as I did in the air, I became quite giddy, &s;o could not make the lea&s;t exertion for &s;aving my&s;elf as I was falling, and came with great force to the ground; you &s;ee how my eye is &s;till &s;welled; but that is nothing to what it was. My wing is the wor&s;t, and &s;till gives me a great deal of pain; ob&s;erve how it drags on the ground: but as it is not broke, my father &s;ays it will &s;oon be well; and I hope it will be &s;o, for I long to be flying, and &s;hall be glad to recieve any in&s;tructions for the future. I cannot think how I could be &s;o fooli&s;hly conceited, as to &s;uppo&s;e I knew how to conduct my&s;elf without my father's guidance.</P>
<P>Why, &s;aid Peck&s;y, young creatures like us, cer|tainly &s;tand in need of in&s;truction, and ought to think our&s;elves happy in having parents who are willing to take the trouble of teaching what is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for us to know. I dread the day, when I mu&s;t quit the ne&s;t and take care of my&s;elf. Flap&s;y &s;aid, &s;he made no doubt they &s;hould know how to fly, and peck, and do every thing before that time; and for her part, &s;he longed to &s;ee the world, and to know how the higher ranks of birds behaved them&s;elves, and what plea&s;ure they enjoyed; and Dicky declared he formed the &s;ame wi&s;hes, though
<PB N="119" REF="027817_0118_0FD64ED34DA9D938">
he mu&s;t confe&s;s, he had great dread of birds of prey; Oh! &s;aid Flap&s;y, they will never &s;ieze &s;uch a pret|ty creature as you Dicky, I am &s;ure: why if beau|ty can prevail again&s;t cruelty, you will al&s;o be &s;e|cure, my &s;weet &s;i&s;ter, replied he, for your delicate engaging &s;hape mu&s;t plead in your behalf.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he had fini&s;hed his &s;peech, a hawk appear|ed in &s;ight, on which the whole party was &s;iezed with a mo&s;t uncommon &s;en&s;ation, and involuntari|ly threw them&s;elves on their backs, &s;creaming with all their might; and at the &s;ame in&s;tant the cries of numbers of little birds be&s;ides, echoed through the orchard. The Redbrea&s;ts &s;oon recovered, and ri|&s;ing on their feet, looked about to &s;ee what was become of the cau&s;e of their con&s;ternation; when they beheld him high in the air, bearing off &s;ome unhappy victim, a few of who&s;e feathers fell near the young family, who on examining them found they belonged to a goldfinch; on which Peck&s;y ob|&s;erved, that it was evident the&s;e &s;avages paid no attention to per&s;onal beauty. Dicky was &s;o terri|fied he knew not what to do, and had thought of flying back to the ne&s;t; but after Robin's misfor|tune, was fearful of offending his father; he there|fore got up into a currant-bu&s;h, and hid him&s;elf in the thicke&s;t part of the leaves. Flap&s;y followed him, but Robin being obliged to keep on the ground, Peck&s;y kindly re&s;olved to bear him company.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="027817_0119_0FD64ED70BC67EF0">In a few minutes their parents returned from Mr. Ben&s;on's, and found the two latter pretty near where they had left them; but mi&s;&s;ing the others, the mother with great anxiety enquired what was become of them? Robin then related how they had been frightened with a hawk&punc; and whil&s;t he was doing &s;o, they returned to him again.</P>
<P>I am &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;aid the father, that a Hawk &s;hould venture &s;o near the &s;pot where the gardener is at work. O, &s;aid Peck&s;y, we have not &s;een him &s;ince you left us; then I dare &s;ay he is gone to break|fa&s;t, replied the mother; and this was the ca&s;e, for they at this in&s;tant &s;aw him return with his &s;hears in his hand, and &s;oon pur&s;ue his work. Now you will be &s;afe, cried the father; I &s;hall therefore &s;tay and teach you to fly in different directions, and then your mother and I &s;hall make &s;ome little ex|cur&s;ions, and leave you to practi&s;e by your&s;elves; but fir&s;t of all let me &s;hew you how to get water, for I fear you mu&s;t be very thir&s;ty. No, &s;aid they, we have had &s;everal wet worms and juicy caterpil|lars, which have &s;erved us both for victuals and drink, Robin is very quick at finding them. There is nothing like nece&s;&s;ity to teach birds how to live, &s;aid the father; I am glad Robin's misfortunes have been &s;o beneficial to him. What would have be|come of you, if you had not exerted your&s;elves as I directed? &s;aid the mother; you would &s;oon have
<PB N="121" REF="027817_0120_0FD62590F8FE1298">
died, had you continued to lie on the &s;corching ground. Remember from this in&s;tant as long as you live, that it is better to u&s;e means for your own relief, than to &s;pend time in fruitle&s;s lamentations.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to Hawks, &s;aid the father, they are frightful creatures to be &s;ure; but there are very few of them in compari&s;on of mo&s;t other birds, and they can take but one at a time, therefore it is a very great chance whether any of you is that one; your be&s;t way will be to keep as near to hou&s;es as you can, and make your&s;elves familiar with man|kind, and I think you will be in little danger. By the way, let me ob&s;erve, how greatly indebted you are to this good gardener, whom I hope you no longer call a mon&s;ter. Oh no! &s;aid Flap&s;y, he is a dear good creature. But I was going to &s;ay, cried the father, that at any rate, it would be wrong to make your life unhappy with appre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n&s;ions; you cannot keep Hawks away by fearing them; and it is po&s;&s;ible, you may never &s;ee another; be&s;ides what thou&s;ands e&s;cape, in compari&s;on of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew they devour! But come along, Dicky, Flap&s;y and Peck|&s;y, there is water &s;o near, that Robin can hop &s;o far: he then conducted them to a pump, from whence Joe watered the garden, and under its &s;pout, they found an ample &s;upply of that delight|ful
<PB N="122" REF="027817_0121_0FD64EDD9DBFAD48">
element, more acceptable to them than the mo&s;t co&s;tly wine would have been.</P>
<P>Here they &s;taid &s;ome time, and were greatly a|mu&s;ed; &s;till &s;o near the gardener, that they regarded them&s;elves as under his protection. The parents flew up into a tree, and there the father entertain|ed his beloved mate and family with his chearful mu&s;ic; and &s;ometimes they made various airy ex|cur&s;ions for examples to their little ones, who all longed to be able to imitate them. In this manner the day pa&s;&s;ed happily away, and early in the even|ing Flap&s;y, Peck&s;y, and Dicky, were conducted to the ne&s;t; they mounted in the air with much more ca&s;e than the preceding day, and the parents in|&s;tructed them how to fly to the branches of &s;ome trees which &s;tood near to the ivy-wall.</P>
<P>In the mean time they had left Robin by him&s;elf, thinking he would be &s;afe, whil&s;t the gardener was mowing &s;ome gra&s;s; but what was the grief of both father and mother when they returned, and could neither &s;ee nor hear him. The gardener too was gone, they therefore apprehended that a cat or rat had taken him away and killed him, yet none of his feat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rs were to be &s;een; with the mo&s;t anxious &s;earch, they explored exery rece&s;s in which they thought it po&s;&s;ible for him to be, and &s;trained their little voices till they were ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;e with call|ing
<PB N="123" REF="027817_0122_0FD64EDF1E5A2058">
him, but all in vain; the tool-hou&s;e was lock|ed; but had he been there, he would have an&s;wer|ed: at length quite in de&s;pair of finding him, with heavy hearts they returned to the ne&s;t; a general lamentation en&s;ued, and this lately happy abode, was now a region of &s;orrow. The father endea|voured to comfort his mate and &s;urviving ne&s;tlings, and &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that they re&s;olved to bear their lo&s;s with patience.</P>
<P>After a mournful night, the mother left the ne&s;t early in the morning, unwilling to relinqui&s;h the hope which &s;till remained, of finding Robin again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; but, having &s;pent an hour in this manner, &s;he re|turned to her mate, who was comforting his little ones.</P>
<P>Come, &s;aid he, let us take a flight, if we &s;it lamenting here for ever it will be to no purpo&s;e&punc; the evils which befal us mu&s;t be borne, and the more quietly we &s;ubmit to them the lighter they will be. If poor Robin is dead, he will &s;uffer no more; and if he is not, &s;o much as we fly about, it is a chance but we get tidings of him; &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e little ones attempt to fly with us to your benefactors? If we &s;et out early and let them re&s;t frequently by the way, I think they may accompli&s;h it. This was very plea&s;ing to every one of the little ones, for they longed to go thither, and accordingly it was
<PB N="124" REF="027817_0123_0FD64EE245A00C58">
determined that they &s;hould immediately &s;et out, and they accompli&s;hed the journey by ea&s;y &s;tages; at length they all arrived in the court, ju&s;t after the daily pen&s;ioners were gone.</P>
<P>Now, &s;aid the father, &s;top a little, and let me advi&s;e you Dicky, Flap&s;y, and Peck&s;y, to behave your&s;elves properly; hop only where you &s;ee your mother and me hop, and do not meddle with any thing, but what is &s;cattered on purpo&s;e. Stay, father, &s;aid Dicky, my feathers are &s;adly rumpled, and &s;o are mine, &s;aid Flap&s;y. Well, &s;mooth them then, &s;aid the father, but don't &s;tand finicking for an hour. Peck&s;y was ready in an in&s;tant, but the others were very tedious, &s;o their father and mother would wait for them no longer, and flew into the window; the others directly followed them, and to the inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction of Ma&s;ter Ben&s;on alighted on the tea-table, where they met with a very unexpected plea&s;ure; for who &s;hould they find there, as a gue&s;t, but the poor lo&s;t Ro|bin! The meeting was, you may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, a hap|py one for all parties, and the tran&s;ports it oc|ca&s;ioned, may be ea&s;ier conceived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The father poured forth a loud <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of gratitude; the mother chirped, &s;he bowed her head, clapped her wings ba&s;ked on the tea-table, joined her beak to Robin's, then touched the hand of Ma&s;ter Frede|rick.
<PB N="125" REF="027817_0124_0FD64EE39AC58FB8">
As for the young ones, they twittered a thou&s;and que&s;tions to Robin, but as he was unwil|ling to di&s;turb his father's &s;ong, he de&s;ired them to &s;u&s;pend their curio&s;ity to another opportunity.

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<P>YOU may remember that ma&s;ter Frederick ob|tained from his mamma a promi&s;e that when the bu&s;ine&s;s of daily in&s;truction was fini&s;hed, he and his &s;i&s;ter &s;hould go into the orchard in &s;earch of the Robins; as &s;oon, therefore, as the air was &s;uffici|ently cool, &s;he took them with her, and arrived ju&s;t after the parent birds had taken the young ones back to the ne&s;t. Robin was then left by him&s;elf, and kept hopping about, and fearing no danger, got into the middle of the walk. Frederick de&s;cri|ed him at a di&s;tance, and eagerly called out, there's one of them, I declare; and before his mamma ob|&s;erved him, he ran to the place, and clapped his little hand over it, exulting that he had caught it. The pre&s;&s;ure of the hand hurt Robin's wing, who &s;ent forth piteous cries; on which Frederick
<PB N="126" REF="027817_0125_0FD64EEB44A2A540">
let him go, and &s;aid, I won't hurt you, you little thing.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Harriet, who &s;aw him catch the bird, ran as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to prevent his detaining it; and perceived that as Robin hopped away he was lame, on which &s;he concluded that her brother had hurt him; but on Frederick's a&s;&s;uring her that his wing hung down when he fir&s;t &s;aw him, Mrs. Ben&s;on &s;aid it was mo&s;t likely he was lamed by &s;ome acci|dent, which prevented his going with the others to the ne&s;t: and if that is the ca&s;e, &s;aid &s;he, it will be humane and charitable to take care of him. Frederick was delighted to hear her &s;ay &s;o, and a&s;ked whether he might carry it home? Yes, &s;aid his mamma, pro|vided you can take him &s;afely. Shall I carry him Madam? &s;aid Joe, he can lie nicely in my hat. This was an excellent &s;cheme, and all parties ap|proved of it; &s;o Frederick took &s;ome of the &s;oft gra&s;s which was mowed down, to put at the bottom and poor Robin was &s;afely depo&s;ited in his vehicle which &s;erved him for a litter; and perceiving into what hands he was fallen, he inwardly rejoiced, knowing that he had an excellent chance of being well provided for, as well as of &s;eeing his dear re|lations again. I need not &s;ay that great care was taken of him, and you will ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e he had a more comfortable night than that he had pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="027817_0126_0FD64EEB51D2C268">When Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;s Ben&s;on aro&s;e the next morning, one of their fir&s;t cares was to feed the birds, and they had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee all their ne&s;tlings in a thriving condition: both the Linnet and Blackbird now hopped out of their ne&s;ts to be fed, to the great diver&s;ion of Ma&s;ter Frederick: but this plea&s;ure was &s;oon damped by an unlucky acci|dent; for the Blackbird being placed in a window which was open, hopped too near the edge, and fell to the ground, where he was &s;napped up by a dog, and torn to peices in an in&s;tant. Frederick began to cry as before; but on his &s;i&s;ter's reminding him, that the creature was pa&s;t the &s;en&s;e of pain, he re&s;trained his tears, and turned his attention to the Linnet, which he put into a cage that he might not meet the &s;ame &s;ate. He then went to feed the flock and to enquire after Robin, whom Mrs. Ben&s;on had taken into her own room, le&s;t Frederick &s;hould handle and hurt him; to his great joy he found him much better, for he could begin to u&s;e his in|jured wing. Frederick was therefore tru&s;ted to car|ry him into the brea&s;tfa&s;t parlour, where he placed him as has been already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time the young Redbrea&s;ts behaved ve|ry well; but at length Dicky, familiarized by the kind treatment he met with, forgot his father's in|junctions,

and began to hop about in a very rude manner; he even jumped into the plate of bread and butter; and having a mind to ta&s;te the tea, hopped on the edge of a cup, but dipping his foot in the hot liquor, he was glad to make a ha&s;ty re|treat, to the great diver&s;ion of Ma&s;ter Frederick. Flap&s;y took the freedom of pecking at the &s;ugar, but found it too hard for her tenden beak. For the&s;e liberties their mother reproved them, &s;aying, &s;he would never bring them with her again, if they were guilty of &s;uch rudene&s;s, as to take what was not offered to them. As their longer &s;tay would have broke in on a plan which Mrs. Ben&s;on had concerted, &s;he rung her bell, and the footman came to remove the tea-things; on which the old birds, having taken leave of Robin, and promi&s;ed to come again the next day, flew out at the window, fol|lowed by Dicky, Flap&s;y, and Peck&s;y. Robin was &s;afely depo&s;ited in a cage, and pa&s;&s;ed a happy day, being often allowed to hop out in order to be fed.</P>
<P>The parent birds alighted in the court, and con|ducted their little ones to the water which was &s;et out for them, after which they all returned to the ne&s;t; here the young ones re&s;ted till the afternoon, and then their parents took them out in order to &s;hew them the orchard.</P>

<P>YOU have not yet, &s;aid the father, &s;een the whole extent of this place, and I wi&s;h to in|troduce you to our neighbours. He then led the way to a peartree, in which a Linnet had built her ne&s;t. The old Linnets &s;eemed much plea&s;ed to &s;ee their friends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Readbrea&s;ts, who with great pride introduced their little family to them. My own ne&s;tlings are ju&s;t ready to fly, &s;aid the hen Linnet, and I hope will make acquaintance with them; for birds &s;o well in&s;tructed as, I make no doubt, your offspring are, mu&s;t be very de&s;irable companions. The little Readbrea&s;ts were quite delighted with the hopes of having &s;ome agreeable friends; and the old ones replied, that they had them&s;elves re|ceived &s;o much plea&s;ure from &s;ocial friend&s;hip, that they wi&s;hed their young ones to cultivate the &s;ame.</P>
<P>They then flew on to a cherry-tree, in which were a pair of Chaffinches in great agitation, en|deavouring to part one of their own brood and a young Sparrow, who were engaged in a furious battle; but all in vain, neither of the combatants would de&s;i&s;t, till the Chaffinch dropped dead to the ground. His parents were greatly &s;hocked at this accident, on which the cock Readbrea&s;t attempted
<PB N="130" REF="027817_0129_0FD64EF02DC23008">
to comfort them with his &s;trains; but finding them deaf to his mu&s;ic, he begged to know the cau&s;e of the quarrel, which had had &s;o fatal a conclu&s;ion? O! an&s;wered the hen Chaffinch, my ne&s;tling is lo&s;t through his own folly. I cautioned him repeatedly not to make acquaintance with Sparrows, knowing they would lead him into mi&s;chief; but no remon|&s;trance would prevail. As &s;oon as he began to peck about, he formed a friend&s;hip with one of that voracious breed, who undertook to teach him to fly and provide for him&s;elf; &s;o he left his parents and continually followed the Sparrow, who taught him to &s;teal corn, and other things, and to quarrel with every bird he met; I expected to &s;ee him killed continually. At length his companion grew tired of him, and picked a quarrel, which ended as you have &s;een. However, this is better than if he had been caught by men, and hung up, as I have &s;een many a bird, for a &s;pectacle, to deter others from &s;tealing. Let me advi&s;e you my young friends, &s;aid &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to the little Redbrea&s;ts, to follow your parents directions in e|very re&s;pect, and avoid bad company. She then, accompanied by her mate, flew back to her ne&s;t, in order to acquaint the re&s;t of her family with this dreadful cata&s;trophe, and the Redbrea&s;ts took an|other flight.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="027817_0130_0FD64EF29ADB32C8">They alighted on the ground, and began pecking about, when all of a &s;udden they heard a &s;trange noi&s;e, which rather alarmed the young ones. Their father de&s;ired them to have no fears, but follow him; he led them to the top of a high tree, in which was a ne&s;t of Magpies. They had the day before, made an excur&s;ion round the orchard, and were conver&s;ing on what they had &s;een, but in &s;uch a confu&s;ed manner, that there was no &s;uch thing as under&s;tanding them; one chattered of one thing, and one of another. In &s;hort, all were eager to &s;peak, and none inclined to hear.</P>
<P>What a &s;et of fooli&s;h ill-bred little creatures are the&s;e, &s;aid the cock Redbrea&s;t; if they would talk one at a time, what each &s;ays might afford enter|tainment to the re&s;t; but by chattering all together in this manner, they are quite di&s;agreeable. Take example from them, my ne&s;tlings, and avoid the fault which renders them &s;o ridiculous.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he flew on, and they &s;oon &s;aw a Cuckow, &s;urrounded by a number of birds, who had been pecking at her till &s;he had &s;carce a feather left upon her brea&s;t, while &s;he kept repeating her own dull note, Cuckow! Cuckow! ince&s;&s;antly. Get back again to your own country, &s;aid a Thru&s;h; what bu&s;ine&s;s have you in ours, &s;ucking the eggs, and taking the ne&s;ts of any birds you meet with?
<PB N="132" REF="027817_0131_0FD64EF5F82DCE30">
Surely it would be &s;ufficient, could you have the privilege of building for your&s;elf, as we do who are natives; but you have no right to &s;eize upon our labours, and devour our offspring. The Cuckow de|&s;erves his fate, &s;aid the hen Redbrea&s;t. Though I am far from bearing enmity to foreign birds in ge|neral. I dete&s;t &s;uch characters as his. I wonder mankind do not drive Cuckows away; but I &s;up|po&s;e it is on account of their being the harbingers of &s;ummer.</P>
<P>How different is the character of the Swallow; he comes here to enjoy the mildne&s;s of the climate, and confers a benefit on the land by de&s;troying many noxous in&s;ects. I rejoice to &s;ee that race &s;porting in the air, and have had high plea&s;ure in con|ver&s;ing with them; for as they are great travel|lers, they have much to relate. But come let us go on.</P>
<P>They &s;oon came to a hollow tree, peep into this hole, &s;aid the cock bird to his young ones, they did &s;o, and beheld a ne&s;t of young Owls. What a &s;et of ugly creatures, &s;aid Dicky; &s;urely you do not intend to &s;hew your frightful faces to the world! Did ever any one &s;ee &s;uch dull eyes, and &s;uch a frightful muffle of feathers?</P>
<P>Whoever you are that reproach us with a want of beauty, you do not &s;hew your own good &s;en&s;e,
<PB N="133" REF="027817_0132_0FD64EF71C0F45F8">
replied one of the little Owls. Perhaps we may have qualities which render us as amiable as your|&s;elves. You do not appear to know that we are Night, and not Day birds. The quantity of fea|thers in which we are muffled up, are very com|fortable to us when we are out in the cold; and I can &s;hew you a pair of eyes, which, if you are little birds, will frighten you out of your wits; and if I could fly, I would let you &s;ee what el&s;e I could do. He then drew back the film which was given him, that the &s;trong light of the day might not injure his &s;ight, and &s;tared full at Dicky, who was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>At that in&s;tant the parent Owl returned, and &s;eeing a parcel of &s;trangers looking into her ne&s;t, &s;he &s;et up a &s;creeching, which made the whole par|ty take wing. As &s;oon as they &s;topped to re&s;t, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ock Redbrea&s;t, who was really frightened as well as his mate and family, recollected him&s;elf, and cried out, Well, Dicky, how did you like the Owl's eyes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fancy they proved brighter than you expec|ted&punc; but had they even been as ugly as you &s;up|po&s;ed, it was very &s;illy and rude in you to notice it. You ought never to cen&s;ure any bird for natu|ral deformities, &s;ince no one contracts them by choice; and what appears di&s;agreeable to you, may
<PB N="134" REF="027817_0133_0FD64EFA3036B660">
be plea&s;ing in the eyes of another. Be&s;ides, you &s;hould be particularly careful not to in&s;ult &s;trangers, becau&s;e you cannot know their de&s;erts, nor what power they may have of revenging them&s;elves. You may think your&s;elf happy if you never meet one of the&s;e Owls by night, for I a&s;&s;ure you they often feed upon little birds like us; and you have no rea|&s;on to think they will &s;pare you, after the affront you have given them. But come, let us fly on.</P>
<P>They &s;oon alighted on a tree, in which was a Mock-Bird,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Mock-Bird is properly a native of America, but introduced here for the &s;ake of the moral.</NOTE> who, in&s;tead of &s;inging any note o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his own, kept &s;ucce&s;&s;ively imitating tho&s;e of every bird that inhabited the orchard, and this with a view of making them ridiculous. If any one had any imperfection in his &s;inging, he was &s;ure to mimic it; or if any was particularly attentive to the duties of his &s;tation, he ridiculed him as grave and formal. The young Redbrea&s;ts were exce&s;&s;ive|ly diverted with this droll creature: but their fa|ther de&s;ired them to con&s;ider, whether they &s;hould like to hear him mimic them? Every one agreed, that they &s;hould be very angry to be ridiculed in that manner. Then, replied the father, neither encourage nor imitate him. The Mock-Bird hear|ing
<PB N="135" REF="027817_0134_0FD64EFBF87E72B8">
him, took up his notes, "Neither encourage nor imitate him," &s;aid he. The cock Redbrea&s;t on this flew at him with fury plucked &s;ome feathers from his brea&s;t, and &s;ent him &s;creaming from the place. I have made you &s;ing a Natural note at la&s;t, &s;aid he, and hope you will take care how you prac|ti&s;e Mimickry again. His mate was &s;orry to &s;ee him di&s;turb his temper, and ruffle his feathers, for &s;uch an in&s;ignificant creature; but he told her it was particularly nece&s;&s;ary as an example to his ne&s;tlings, as Mimickry was a fault to which young birds were too apt to incline; and he wi&s;hed to &s;hew them the danger they expo&s;ed them&s;elves to in the practice of it.</P>
<P>The whole Redbrea&s;t family re&s;ted them&s;elves for &s;ome time; and whil&s;t they &s;at &s;till, ob&s;erved a Chaffinch flying from tree to tree, chattering to e|very bird he had any knowledge of; and his di&s;|cour&s;e &s;eemed to affect his hearers greatly, for they perceived &s;ome birds flying off in great ha&s;te, and others meeting them; many battles and di&s;putes en&s;ued. The little Redbrea&s;ts wondered at the&s;e circum&s;tances; at length Peck&s;y enquired the mean|ing of the bu&s;tle. This Chaffinch, replied the fa|ther, is a Telltale; it is inconceivable the mi&s;chief he makes. Not that he has &s;o much malice in his
<PB N="136" REF="027817_0135_0FD64F003B2C54A8">
nature, but he loves to hear him&s;elf chatter; and therefore every anecdote he can collect he tells to all he meets, by which means he often rai&s;es quar|rels and animo&s;ities; neither does he &s;top here, for he frequently invents the tales he relates.</P>
<P>As the Redbrea&s;t was &s;peaking, the Chaffinch alighted on the &s;ame tree. O, my old friend, &s;aid he, are you got abroad in the world again? I heard the Linnet in the pear-tree &s;ay, you were caught &s;tealing corn, and hung up as a &s;pectacle, but I thought this could not be true; be&s;ides, the Black|bird in the cherry-tree told me, that the rea&s;on we did not &s;ee you as u&s;ual was, that you were rearing a family, to whom, he &s;aid, you were &s;o &s;evere, that the poor little creatures had no comfort of their lives.</P>
<P>Whatever you may have heard, or whatever you may &s;ay, is matter of indifference to me, replied the Redbrea&s;t; but as a neighbour, I cannot help advi&s;ing you to re&s;train your tongue a little and con&s;ider, before you communicate your intelligence, whether what you are going to &s;ay has not a ten|dency to di&s;turb the peace of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was thus advi&s;ing him, a flock of birds a&s;&s;embled about the tree; it con&s;i&s;ted of tho&s;e to whom the Chaffinch had been chattering, who hav|ing come to explanation with each other, had de|tected
<PB N="137" REF="027817_0136_0FD64F0263E28600">
his fal&s;ities, and determined to expel him the orchard; which they did, with every mark of contempt and ignominy: all the Redbrea&s;ts joined in the pur&s;uit, for even the little ones &s;aw his cha|racter in a dete&s;table light, and formed a determi|nation to avoid his fault. When the tell-tale was gone, the party which pur&s;ued him alighted all to|gether in the &s;ame walk, and among&s;t them the Redbrea&s;ts di&s;covered many of their old friends, with whom they now renewed their acquaintance, knowing they &s;hould &s;oon be relea&s;ed from family cares; and the young ones pa&s;&s;ed a happy day in this cheerful a&s;&s;embly: but at length the hour of repo&s;e approached, when each individual fled to his re&s;ting-place; and the Redbrea&s;ts, after &s;o fa|tiguing a day, fell a&s;leep.</P>
<P>Let us leave them to enjoy the comfort of the ne&s;t, and enquire after their young benefactors.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as breakfa&s;t things were removed at Mrs. Ben&s;on's, &s;he informed her &s;on and daughter,
<PB N="138" REF="027817_0137_0FD64F041C151A28">
that &s;he intended to take them with her to Farmer Wil&s;on's, where &s;he made no doubt they would pa&s;s a happy day; and de&s;ired them to go and get equipped for the journey, whil&s;t &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her|&s;elf. The young folks obeyed without he&s;itation, and having given their maid very &s;trict injunctions to feed Robin and the Linnet, they attended mam|ma to the coach; and after a delightful ride arri|ved at the farm-hou&s;e, where they were received with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect by Mrs. Wil&s;on.</P>
<P>Farmer Wil&s;on was a very worthy man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great &s;hare of natural good &s;en&s;e and bene|volence of heart. He had, by his indu&s;try acqui|red &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e the farm he lived on, and had a fair pro&s;pect of making a comfortable provi|&s;ion for a numerous family, whom he brought up with the greate&s;t care, and taught them all to be merciful to the cattle which were employed in his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>His wife was a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> amiable woman, and had received a good education from her father, who was formerly curate of the pari&s;h. This good man had &s;trongly implanted in his daughter's mind the Chri&s;tian doctrine of UNIVERSAL CHARITY,
<PB N="139" REF="027817_0138_0FD64F0565F8B018">
which &s;he exerci&s;ed, not only towards the human &s;pecies, but al&s;o extended it to poultry, and every living creature which it was her province to ma|nage.</P>
<P>Mrs. Ben&s;on knew that her children would here have an opportunity of &s;eeing many different animals treated with propriety; and it was on this account that &s;he took them with her, though &s;he, her&s;elf complied with an invitation &s;he had received the day before, and vi&s;ited the&s;e good people from a motive of &s;incere re&s;pect.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were &s;eated, Mrs. Wil&s;on regal|ed her young friends with a peace of nice cake, made by her daughter Bet&s;y, a little girl of twelve years old, who &s;at by, enjoying with a &s;ecret de|light, the honour which the young Lady and Gen|tleman did to her performance. It happened for|tunately to be a cool day, and Mrs. Ben&s;on expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to walk about and &s;ee the farm.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, Mrs. Wil&s;on &s;hewed her the hou&s;e, which was in every re&s;pect very neat, and in compleat order. She then took her gue&s;t into her dairy, which was well &s;tored with milk and cream&punc; butter and chee&s;e. From hence they went to the
<PB N="140" REF="027817_0139_0FD64F07295BE7E8">
the poultry-yard, where the little Ben&s;ons were ex|ce&s;&s;ively delighted indeed; for there were a num|ber of cocks and hens, and many broods of young chickens, be&s;ides turkies and Guinea hens.</P>
<P>All the fowls expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t joy at the &s;ight of Mrs. Wil&s;on and her daughter Bet&s;y; the cocks celebrated their arrival by loud crowing; the hens gave notice of their approach by cackling, and a&s;&s;embled their infant train to partake of their bounty; the turkies and Guinea fowls ran to meet them; a number of pigeons al&s;o alighted from a pigeon-hou&s;e. Bet&s;y &s;cattered among&s;t them the grain which &s;he carried in her lap for that purpo&s;e, and &s;eemed to have great plea&s;ure in di&s;tributing it. When their young vi&s;itors were &s;atisfied with &s;eeing the poultry fed, Mrs. Wil&s;on &s;hewed them the hen-hou&s;e, and other conveniencies provided for them, which were excellently calculated to make their lives comfortable; and then opened a little door, which led to a meadow, where the fowls were often indulged to ramble and refre&s;h them&s;elves. On &s;ee|ing her approach this place the whole party col|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cted, and ran into the meadow, like a troop of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ol-boys into their play-ground.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="027817_0140_0FD64F0892356468">You, Mrs. Wil&s;on, and your daughter, mu&s;t have great amu&s;ement with the&s;e pretty creatures, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on. We have indeed, Madam, and great profit too; for they furni&s;h us with a va&s;t number of eggs and chickens, not only for our own u&s;e, but for the market al&s;o. And can you prevail on your&s;elf to kill the&s;e &s;weet creatures? &s;aid Mi&s;s Ben&s;on. Indeed, Mi&s;s I cannot, &s;aid Mrs. Wil&s;on, and never did kill a chicken in my life; but it is an ea&s;y matter to find people capable of doing it; and there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ome of them to die, for they breed &s;o fa&s;t, that in a &s;hort time we &s;hould have more than we could po&s;&s;ibly feed: but I make it a rule to render their lives as happy as po&s;&s;ible, and never &s;hut them up to fatten any longer than I can help, u&s;e no cruel methods of cramming them, nor confine them in a &s;ituation where they can &s;ee other fowls at liberty; neither do I take the chickens from the hen till &s;he her&s;elf de&s;erts them, nor &s;et hens upon duck eggs. I often regret, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, that &s;o many lives &s;hould be &s;acri|ficed to pre&s;erve ours; but we mu&s;t eat animals, or they would at length eat us, at lea&s;t all that would otherwi&s;e &s;upport us.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed, Ma&s;ter Frederick had followed the fowls into the meadow, where the Turkey cock, taking him for an enemy, had at|tacked
<PB N="142" REF="027817_0141_0FD64F0CDCDDC158">
him, and frightened him &s;o much, than he cried out for help: Bet&s;y Wil&s;on ran to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;oon calmed his fears.</P>
<P>The farmer's wife next propo&s;ed (but with ma|ny apologies for offering to take them to &s;uch a place) to &s;hew them her pig-&s;ties. The name of pig-&s;tye generally conveys an idea of na&s;tine&s;s, but whoever had &s;een tho&s;e at Farmer Wil&s;ons, would have had a very different one. They were neatly paved, and wa&s;hed down every day; the troughs in which they fed were frequently &s;coured, and the water they drank was always &s;weet and whole&s;ome. The pigs them&s;elves had an appearance of neatne&s;s which no one could have expected in &s;uch kind of animals; and though they had not the ingenuity of the learned pig, there was really &s;omething in|telligent in their gruntings, and a very droll arch expre&s;&s;ion in the eyes of &s;ome of them. They knew their benefactors, and found means of te&s;tifying their joy at &s;eeing them; which was increa&s;ed when a boy, whom Mrs. Wil&s;on had ordered to bring &s;ome bean-&s;hells, emptied his ba&s;ket before them. Now a conte&s;t en&s;ued who &s;hould have the large&s;t &s;hare, and each began pu&s;hing the other a&s;ide, and &s;tuf|fing as fa&s;t as he could, le&s;t they &s;hould have more than him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="027817_0142_0FD64F0ED4A1E7F8">Mi&s;s Ben&s;on &s;aid &s;he could not bear to &s;ee &s;uch greedine&s;s. It is indeed, replied Mrs. Ben&s;on, very di&s;agreeable, even in &s;uch creatures as the&s;e, but how much more &s;o in the human &s;pecies, and yet how frequent is this fault among&s;t children in particular? Pray look at the&s;e pigs, Frederick, and tell me if you never remember to have met with a little boy who eat &s;trawberries as the&s;e pigs do bean-&s;hells? Frederick's cheeks at this que&s;tion were covered with con&s;cious blu&s;hes; on which his mamma kind|ly ki&s;&s;ed him, and &s;aid, &s;he hoped he had &s;een e|nough of greedine&s;s to-day to &s;erve him for a le&s;|&s;on as long as he lived.</P>
<P>In a &s;eparate &s;tye was a &s;ow with a litter of young pigs. This was a very plea&s;ing &s;ight indeed to Ma&s;ter Frederick, who longed to have one to play with; but Mrs. Wil&s;on told him it would make the &s;ow very angry; and her gruntings would ter|rify him as much as the turkey-cock had done; on which he dropped his reque&s;t, but &s;aid he &s;hould like to keep &s;uch a little creature.</P>
<P>If it would always continue little, Frederick, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, it would do very well; but it will perhaps grow as large as its mother, and what &s;hall we do then? Familiarized by the kind treat|ment which I am &s;ure you would give it, we &s;hould
<PB N="144" REF="027817_0143_0FD64F152162E000">
have it following you into the parlour, and per|haps run grunting after you into your bed-cham|ber. I knew my&s;elf an in&s;tance of a per&s;on who nur&s;ed up a &s;uck pig, which actually ran after her to church, and became the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome thing you can conceive.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e your hogs are very profitable as well as your poultry, Mrs. Wil&s;on? Yes, Madam, re|plied &s;he, we cure a good deal of bacon and pickle a quantity of pork; we &s;ell a great many &s;ucking pigs, &s;o that we are well paid for keeping them; and I never &s;uffer them to be neglected in any par|ticular, and have the plea&s;ure of thinking, few pigs are happier than mine. But I fear, Ladies, you will be tired with &s;taying here, will it be agreeable to you to take a walk in the garden? With all my heart, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wil&s;on then conducted her gue&s;ts in the garden, which abounded with all kinds of vegita|bles for the table, quantities of fruits, and a varie|ty of flowers. Ma&s;ter Frederick longed to ta&s;te &s;ome of the delecacies which pre&s;ented them&s;elves to his eye, but he had never been taught to gather fruit or flowers without leave, nor to a&s;k for any; how|ever, Mrs. Wil&s;on, with his mamma's permi&s;&s;ion treated him and his &s;i&s;ter with &s;ome fine apples and pears, which Bet&s;y gathered and pre&s;ented in cab|bage

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>THIS &s;ight of the bees was a great entertain|ment, not only to the children, but to Mrs. Ben&s;on al&s;o, who was exce&s;&s;ively plea&s;ed with the ingenuity and indu&s;try with which the&s;e in&s;ects col|lected their honey and wax, formed their cells, and depo&s;ited their &s;tore. She had, by books, acqui|red a knowledge of the natural hi&s;tory of bees, which enabled her to examine their work with much greater &s;atisfaction, than &s;he would have re|ceived from the &s;ight of them, had &s;he been only taught to con&s;ider them only as little &s;tinging crea|tures, whom it was dangerous to approach. This is quite a treat to me indeed, &s;aid &s;he to Mrs. Wil|&s;on, for I never before had an opportunity of &s;ee|ing bees at work in gla&s;s hives. Why, Madam, &s;aid the good woman, few will be at the expence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f them; and indeed my neighbours laugh at me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d call me very whim&s;ical and extravagant for in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulging my&s;elf with them: but I find my account in
<PB N="146" REF="027817_0145_0FD64F1777758668">
keeping bees thus, even upon a principle of oecono|my: for as I do not de&s;troy them, I have greater numbers to work for me, and more honey every year than the la&s;t, notwith&s;tanding I feed my bees in winter. I have made acquaintance with the queen of every hive, who will come to me whenever I call her, and you &s;hall &s;ee one of their maje&s;ties if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>On this &s;he called in a manner to which the in|habitants of the hive they were looking at, were accu&s;tomed to, and a large bee &s;oon &s;ettled on her hand: in an in&s;tant after &s;he was covered from head to foot with bees. Mrs. Ben&s;on was quite terrifi|ed, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;ting, and Frederick ran crying away; but Mrs. Wil&s;on a&s;&s;ured them that the lit|tle creatures would not do any mi&s;chief, if no one attempted to catch them. Bees are in their natural di&s;po&s;itions very harmle&s;s creatures, I a&s;&s;ure you Ma&s;ter Ben&s;on, &s;aid &s;he; though I own they will certainly &s;ting little boys who endeavour to catch them in order to &s;uck their bag of honey, or take out their &s;ting; but you &s;ee that though I have hun|dreds about me, and even on my face and arms, not one offers to do me an injury: and I believe the wa&s;ps &s;eldom &s;ting but in their own defence. She then threw up her hand, which the queen bee re|garded as a &s;ignal of dimi&s;&s;ion, and flew away in great &s;tate, &s;urrounded by her guards, and followed
<PB N="147" REF="027817_0146_0FD64F186CBD8978">
by the re&s;t of her &s;ubjects, each ready to lo&s;e his own life in defence of her's.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething very wonderful, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, in the &s;trong attachment the&s;e little crea|tures have to their &s;overeign, and very in&s;tructive to. I wi&s;h our good King could &s;ee all his &s;ubjects &s;o clo&s;ely united in his intere&s;t! What &s;ay you, Frederick, would you fight for King? Yes mamma, if papa would&mdash;That I a&s;&s;ure you, my dear, he certainly would do, if there were occa&s;ion, as loyal|ly as the be&s;t Bee in the world; and I beg you will remember what I now tell you as long as you live: That it is your duty to love your King, for he is to be con&s;idered as the father of his country. But, mamma, &s;aid Frederick, it is the Queen that the Bees love, and we have a queen too. Yes, my dear, we have &s;o; and I believe her maje&s;ty is as much honoured by her &s;ubjects as a queen bee in her hive, though &s;he has not &s;o full a command over them, for it is a king that governs England as your papa governs his family, and the queen is to be con&s;idered as the mother of the country. But before we take our leave of the bees, let me ob&s;erve to you, my dears, that &s;everal in&s;tructive le&s;&s;ons may be taken from their example. If &s;uch little in&s;ects as the&s;e perform their daily ta&s;ks with &s;o much alacrity, &s;urely it mu&s;t be a &s;hame for children to be idle,
<PB N="148" REF="027817_0147_0FD64F1A19208A78">
and to fret becau&s;e they are put to learn things which will be of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to them in the end; and which would indeed conduce to their pre&s;ent happine&s;s, would they but apply to them with a willing mind.</P>
<P>Science of various kinds pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the human race, as the different flowers offer them&s;elves to bees; and nothing is wanting to extract the &s;weets but an application of tho&s;e faculties of which they are by nature po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. As the indu&s;trious bee flies &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to every fragrant plant within his reach, &s;o do you, my dear children, go from one branch of knowledge to another: but ob&s;erve, the bee does not fly giddily from flower to flower, merely to take a tran&s;ient view of its beauties, he re&s;ts on each, till he has obtained all that will an|&s;wer his purpo&s;e: imitate him in this particular al&s;o, and be not hurried on, by vain curio&s;ity, from book to book, &s;o as to gain only a &s;uperficial know|ledge in the different parts of your education; but remember, that the bee applies the materials he collects to purpo&s;es valuable to him&s;elf, and to the community to which he belongs.</P>
<P>But come, Mrs. Wil&s;on, we mu&s;t, if you plea&s;e, think of retiring from this place; for if we &s;tay here much longer, we &s;hall not have time to enjoy the plea&s;ures you have in re&s;erve for us. On this Mrs. Wil&s;on &s;aid, &s;he was ready to wait on them</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="027817_0148_0FD64F1B77B11C50">As they walked along, Mi&s;s Ben&s;on took notice of a variety of beautiful in&s;ects, and Frederick &s;o far forgot him&s;elf, as to run after a moth and catch it; but his mamma obliged him to let it go imme|diately. Don't you think, Mrs. Wil&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, that it is very wrong to let children catch butter|flies and moths? Indeed, I do, Madam, replied the good woman. Poor little creatures, what in|jury can they do us by <HI>flying about?</HI> In that &s;tate at lea&s;t they are harmle&s;s to us. Caterpillars and &s;nails, it is true, we are frequently obliged to de|&s;troy, on account of their devouring fruit and vege|tables; but unle&s;s they abound &s;o as to be likely to do a real injury, I never let them be meddled with. I often think of my good father's maxim, which was, "Never to take away the life of any creature, unle&s;s it was nece&s;&s;ary for the benefit of mankind." "Whil&s;t there is food and room enough in the world for them and us, let them live and enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings they were formed for," he would &s;ay.</P>
<P>When I was a little girl, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, I had a great propen&s;ity to catching flies and other in|&s;ects, but my father had an excellent micro&s;cope, in which he &s;hewed me a number of different ob|jects, by this means I learnt, that even the minute&s;t creatures might be as &s;u&s;ceptible of pain as my&s;elf; and I declare I cannot put any thing to death, with|out

fancying I hear its bones crack, and that I &s;ee its blood gu&s;hing from its veins and arteries; and &s;o far from having a plea&s;ure in killing even the di&s;|agreeable in&s;ects which are trouble&s;ome in hou&s;es, I a&s;&s;ure you I cannot do it my&s;elf nor &s;ee it done without pain; and yet they certainly may be con&s;i|dered as enemies, and an &s;uch we have a right to de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, Madam, &s;aid Mrs. Wil&s;on, for with|out cleanline&s;s we could not enjoy health. It goes again&s;t me to demoli&s;h a fine &s;pider's web, and yet they make a hou&s;e look very dirty, but I &s;eldom have any in mine, for I took care, when I fir&s;t came to live in it, to de&s;troy the ne&s;ts, and the old &s;pi|ders, finding there was no &s;ecurity for their young ones here, have for&s;aken the hou&s;e; and I am in|clined to think, that the &s;ame vigilance in re&s;pect to other di&s;agreeable in&s;ects, would have the &s;ame effec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on; but pray tell me, do you de&s;troy the web<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the garden &s;piders al&s;o? Not unle&s;s there are &s;o many as to be trouble&s;ome and di&s;agreeable, replied Mrs. Wil&s;on. I &s;hould not my&s;elf like to have the fruits of my indu&s;try de|moli&s;hed, nor my little ones taken out of my arms, or from their warm beds, and cru&s;hed to death. I am of opinion, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, that it would be a good way to accu&s;tom one's &s;elf, before one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls

any thing, to change &s;ituations with it in imagina|tion.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, if I accidentally di&s;turb an ant's ne&s;t, in&s;tead of cru&s;hing the little creatures with thoughtle&s;s inhumanity, as a &s;et of in&s;ignificant atoms, I can fancy them appearing to me of the &s;ame magnitude a micro&s;cope would &s;hew them, and one of them addre&s;&s;ing me in this manner:&mdash; "Step a&s;ide, I entreat you, and let me and my a&s;|&s;ociates pa&s;s in &s;afety, that we may repair the mi&s;|chief you have done to our city. The magazine of corn is fallen in, and I fear my dear parents are buried in the ruins; I hear the lamentations of my mate for the danger of our little ones; and beheld <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of my dear friends, whom you have trod upon, in the agonies of death. Why do you treat with &s;uch barb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rity a &s;et of innocent beings, who have never wilfully done you the lea&s;t injury? Do we ever &s;ting the human race but in our own defence? Do you really want the fruit we eat? And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an the &s;mall quantity of corn we hoard up, be mi&s;&s;ed from your plentiful &s;tores? Is it not misfortune enough for us, that we are the prey of birds, but mu&s;t mankind, to whom thou&s;ands of us would not af|ford even a &s;ingle meal, de&s;troy us for &s;port? Oh!
<PB N="152" REF="027817_0151_0FD64F1F9AD3EB80">
rather ye, who&s;e hearts are alive to the &s;entiments of humanity, plead our cau&s;e to the thoughtle&s;s part of your own &s;pecies, and as lords of the creation, drive away from us tho&s;e natural enemies, which you may &s;ee darting down to devour us! if you love your own offspring think of ours; if you would be pro&s;perous in your own occupations, protect tho&s;e who afford a le&s;&s;on of indu&s;try, which the wi&s;e&s;t of mankind has recommended to your &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, &s;aid Mrs. Wil&s;on, I have often wi&s;hed that poor dumb creatures had &s;omebody to &s;peak for them; many an innocent life would then be &s;aved, which is now de&s;troyed to no end.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid Harriet, I am &s;ure I &s;hall never kill any thing, without fir&s;t magnifying it in my mind, and thinking what it would &s;ay for it&s;elf if able to &s;peak. Then, my dear, I will engage for you, replied her mamma, that you will put but very few creatures to death: but in order to have a pro|per notion of their form, and to be capable of ma|king the&s;e ideal &s;peeches, you mu&s;t &s;tudy Natural Hi&s;tory; from whence you will learn, how won|derful their con&s;truction is; how carefully and ten|derly the inferior creatures provide for their young; how ingenious their various employments are; how far they are from harbouring malice again&s;t the hu|man &s;pecies; and how excellently they are inform|ed
<PB N="153" REF="027817_0152_0FD64F23EEA8FA10">
and in&s;tructed by their great Creator, for the enjoyment of happine&s;s in their different cla&s;&s;es of exi&s;tence, which happine&s;s we have certainly no right wantonly to di&s;turb. Be&s;ides, it is really a meanne&s;s to de&s;troy any creature merely becau&s;e it is <HI>little</HI>; and in children, particularly ab&s;urd to do &s;o; for upon this principle, they mu&s;t them&s;elves expect to be con&s;tantly ill-treated: though no ani|mal &s;tands more in need of tenderne&s;s than they do for many years, from the time of their coming in|to the world; and even men and women might expect to be <HI>annihilated,</HI> by the power of the great CREATOR.</P>
<P>Neither do I know how we can preci&s;ely call any thing <HI>great or little,</HI> &s;ince it is only &s;o by com|paring it with others. An ant or fly may appear to one of its own &s;pecies, who&s;e eyes are formed to &s;ee tho&s;e parts which we cannot di&s;cover without gla&s;&s;es, as con&s;iderable as men and women do to each other: and to creatures of the dimen&s;ions of a mite, one the &s;ize of an ant doubtle&s;s looks formi|dable and gigantic. I therefore think that it is but ju&s;tice to view in&s;ects with micro&s;copic eyes, before we commit cruel deva&s;tations among them.</P>
<P>During this conver&s;ation Ma&s;ter Frederick kept running about making choice of flowers, which Bet&s;y Wil&s;on gathered and formed into no&s;egays for his mamma, and him&s;elf.</P>

<P>THE next place Mrs. Wil&s;on took her gue&s;ts to was a farm-yard, in which was a large hor&s;e-pond. Here her young vi&s;itors were delight|ed with the appearance of a number of gee&s;e and ducks; &s;ome were &s;wimming in the water, &s;ome diving, and others rooting in the mud to &s;ee what fi&s;h or worms they could find.</P>
<P>It appears &s;trange to me, &s;aid Mi&s;s Ben&s;on, that any creatures can take delight in making them|&s;elves &s;o dirty; and yet, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, how many children do the &s;ame, without having any excu&s;e for it? The ducks and gee&s;e grub about &s;o in &s;earch of the nece&s;&s;aries of life; but I have &s;een boys do it merely for diver&s;ion, and &s;ometimes at the hazard of their lives.</P>
<P>Very true, Madam, &s;aid Mrs. Wil&s;on; my lit|tle Neddy had like to have been drowned, no lon|ger ago than la&s;t Monday. He is a little venture|&s;ome rogue, and runs through thick and thin when plea&s;ure is in view; but I fancy he will not hunt ducks about any more: for my part, I do not like any of my children &s;hould make &s;port of teazing animals. I wi&s;h every creature I keep to enjoy happine&s;s to the day of its death, and when it mu&s;t
<PB N="155" REF="027817_0154_0FD64F27DE14ED80">
be killed, to have it di&s;patched by the quicke&s;t means po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Have you any fi&s;h here? &s;aid Frederick. I believe none of any con&s;equence, Sir; the ducks and gee&s;e would take care that none &s;hould grow to any con|&s;iderable &s;ize; but there are plenty in a pond which you will &s;ee in the next field, and I hope to have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you, at dinner eat of &s;ome perch which were caught there. Sometimes we catch fine carp and tench, but only with nets; for neither my good man nor I can bear the cruel diver&s;ion of angling; nor do we allow our children to follow it from a notion that it hardens the heart, and leads to idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>Pray, mamma, &s;aid Mi&s;s Harriet, is it right to catch fi&s;h? I &s;hould think, as they live in water, and we upon land, we have no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ine&s;s with them. You would wi&s;h every one then, my dear, to keep to their own element? Your &s;entiment is a good one in many re&s;pects, but it mu&s;t not be extended &s;o far as to forbid the catching of fi&s;h. Man has dominion over fi&s;h, as well as over bea&s;ts and fowls, and many of them are excellent food for mankind; and the a&s;toni&s;hing increa&s;e of them &s;hews that they are de&s;igned to be &s;o; for were all that are &s;pawned to grow to full &s;ize, there would &s;oon be more than our ponds, or even than the &s;ea it&s;elf would hold, and they would be &s;tarved; therefore there are the
<PB N="156" REF="027817_0155_0FD64F2965CC54A0">
&s;ame rea&s;ons for our feeding on them as on poultry, but we &s;hould be very careful to di&s;patch them as quickly as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Some people are cruel enough to roa&s;t lob&s;ters alive, who&s;e cries I have been told are dreadful to hear; and others will flay eels alive, then put them without their &s;kins into a pail of cold water, and afterwards cut them in pieces, and throw them in|to a frying-pan of boiling fat, where &s;ometimes every &s;eparate piece will wreath about in agony. Thus each poor fi&s;h &s;uffers as many deaths as it is divided into pieces. Now, Harriet, this cannot be right, however authorized by cu&s;tom; therefore I hope you will never &s;uffer &s;uch things to be done in your kitchen when you keep hou&s;e, but always give or|ders that your lob&s;ters be put into boiling water, which kills them &s;oon, and that your eels are knock|ed on the head before they are &s;kinned. This is dreadful enough, though little in compari&s;on of what they &s;uffer by the other methods.</P>
<P>Oh! mamma, &s;aid Harriet, you make me even &s;hudder; I do not believe I &s;hall ever de&s;ire to eat eels; I &s;hall be ready to make &s;peeches for every piece as it lies in a di&s;h before me. But pray tell me, is it cruel to kill frogs and toads? A&s;k Mrs. Wil&s;on, my dear, &s;he has more to do with &s;uch reptiles than I have. Why, Mi&s;s, replied Mrs. Wil&s;on, I am very &s;ingular in regard to &s;uch kind
<PB N="157" REF="027817_0156_0FD64F31301981D0">
of creatures; and though I by no means like to have them in my hou&s;e, I do not make an outcry, and condemn every one to a violent death which is accidentally found in my cellars, or other places; on the contrary, I generally &s;ee it thrown into a ditch at &s;ome di&s;tance to take its chance. There are many birds and water-fowl that feed on young frogs and toads, which will in general keep them from multiplying, &s;o as to be nui&s;ances to us; and it is time enough for us to take arms again&s;t them, if there happens to be a very extraordinary increa&s;e of them. My good man is as particular in re&s;pect to moles; if he finds them in his garden, or any other part of his grounds where they can do mi&s;|chief, he has them killed, but never &s;uffers them to be mole&s;ted when they are harmle&s;s. Neither does he hunt, or permit any one belonging to him to hunt after &s;nakes; for he &s;ays, that if they are not di&s;turbed, they will not come from their haunts to annoy us; and to kill, for the &s;ake of killing, is cruel.</P>
<P>Pray, Mrs. Wil&s;on, &s;aid Frederick, do your &s;ons ever go a birds ne&s;ting? They had better not let me know it, if they do, &s;aid &s;he. No, Sir, I hope I have not a child among&s;t my family capable of &s;uch barbarity. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer they generally have young birds to nur&s;e, who fall out of the ne&s;t, or lo&s;e their parents, but are &s;eldom
<PB N="158" REF="027817_0157_0FD64F32609D8490">
lucky enough to rai&s;e them; and we have only one in a cage which they reared la&s;t &s;ummer. Yet we have plenty of &s;inging; for the &s;weet creatures, finding they may enjoy them&s;elves unmole&s;ted in the trees, treat us with their harmony from morn|ing to night, of which you had a &s;pecimen in the garden. Sparrows, indeed, my hu&s;band is under the nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;troying, for they are &s;uch de|vourers, they would leave him but little corn to carry to market if he did not &s;hoot them; but he never kills the Crows, becau&s;e they are very &s;er|viceable in picking up grubs, and other things in|jurious to farmers: we only &s;et a little boy to watch our new-&s;own grain, who keeps making a noi&s;e, which effectually frightens them. O! &s;aid Frederick, I nur&s;e young birds too. I have got a Linnet and a Robin Redbrea&s;t, and feed an hundred be&s;ide.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wil&s;on &s;miled, and turning away to Mrs. Ben&s;on, &s;aid, Now, Madam, we will, if you plea&s;e, return to the hou&s;e, for I fancy by this time dinner is nearly ready, and my hu&s;band and &s;ons are about coming home.</P>
<P>Mrs. Ben&s;on was a little tired with her ramble, and was really impatient to &s;ee Farmer Wil&s;on and the re&s;t of his amiable family. When &s;he drew near the hou&s;e &s;he was met by the worthy man, who gave her a mo&s;t cordial welcome, and &s;aid he
<PB N="159" REF="027817_0158_0FD64F33DB1E98B0">
was proud to &s;ee &s;o much good company. Nancy, the elde&s;t daughter, to whom the mother had en|tru&s;ted the care of in&s;pecting the additional cooke|ry which &s;he had ordered, and who for that rea|&s;on was not to be &s;een in the morning, now made her appearance, dre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t perfect neatne&s;s; health blooming in her cheeks, and cheer|fulne&s;s and good humour &s;parkled in her eyes. With this engaging countenance &s;he ea&s;ily prevailed on Ma&s;ter Frederick to let her place him by her on the table, round which the two other vi&s;itors, and the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, and the re&s;t of their offspring, con&s;i&s;ting of Thomas, a fine youth of eighteen, four younger boys, and little Bet&s;y, were &s;oon &s;eated.</P>
<P>The table was covered with plain food, but by the good management of Nancy, who had made an excellent pudding, an apple-pye and &s;ome delicious cu&s;tards, it made a very good figure; and Mrs. Ben&s;on often afterwards declared, that &s;he never enjoyed an entertainment &s;o much. It was con&s;i|derably heightened by the happy countenances of the whole family. The father who was a joco&s;e man &s;aid a number of droll things, which diverted his little vi&s;itors very much, and &s;oon after dinner he begged leave to depart, as he was &s;heep-&s;hearing; but &s;aid, he thought the young gentlefolks might

be diverted with the &s;ight, &s;o invited them to pay him a vi&s;it in the field, and left Joe and Neddy to conduct Ma&s;ter Frederick.</P>

<P>THE young farmers were rather &s;hy at fir&s;t, being afraid their gue&s;ts would laugh at their country talk; but when they ob&s;erved how politely they behaved to their &s;i&s;ters, they entered into conver&s;ation, and told Ma&s;ter Ben&s;on an hundred particulars about animals, with which he was be|fore unacquainted; and he in return told them all he knew about the Redbrea&s;ts and other pen&s;ioners. They then &s;hewed him a pretty cat with kittens, and a bitch with two young puppies; the latter were kept in a kennel, and the cat in a &s;table where they were well &s;upplied with food. As Frederick knew that his &s;i&s;ter was remarkably fond of cats, he &s;tepped back to call her to look at the&s;e, which with her mamma's permi&s;&s;ion, &s;he was greatly plea|&s;ed to do, and longed to have the kittens to nur&s;e. When &s;he returned, &s;he enquired whether the dogs

and cats were ever permitted to come into the hou&s;e? Not whil&s;t they have young ones, &s;aid Mrs. Wil&s;on, for they make a great deal of dirt and are very trouble&s;ome at that time; but when pu&s;s has brought up her family, which is de&s;igned for the &s;table, &s;he &s;hall be admitted among&s;t us again; for &s;he is a very u&s;eful creature, and de&s;erves to be well treated, but I do not &s;uffer my children to handle her; I think it looks very ugly for any one to be all over &s;cratches. Daphne is admitted to a greater &s;hare of familiarity; &s;he is very faithful, and extremely good-natured, but we never feed her in the hou&s;e, for there is no doing &s;o without grea&s;ing the floors.</P>
<P>I am of opinion, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, that a dif|ference &s;hould be made between our treatment of cats and dogs. There is &s;omething very &s;avage in the nature of the former; and though they certain|ly are de&s;erving of our kindne&s;s on account of their u&s;efulne&s;s, yet they cannot make them&s;elves &s;o a|greeable as dogs. There is &s;omething really very formidable in their talons and teeth; and when enraged, a cat is no better than a little tygre&s;s. Be&s;ides, where there not danger to one's &s;elf nur|&s;ing
<PB N="162" REF="027817_0161_0FD64F395DBADED0">
cats, there is no doing it without injury to one's linen; for when pu&s;s is be&s;t plea&s;ed, &s;he generally tramples with her talons un&s;heathed, by which practice many a nice apron has been torn. And even the cleanline&s;s of cats is injurious, for they u&s;ually have recour&s;e to corners of chairs, in order to rub the dirt from their talons. Many people have a great dread of this animal, and on that ac|count it &s;hould not be u&s;ed to come into rooms in which a variety of company is received.</P>
<P>As for dogs, they are in general &s;o very &s;ociable, grateful and plea&s;ing, that they &s;eem formed to be the humble companions of mankind; and if kept in proper order, may be familiarized with &s;afety; but then they &s;hould be well educated and taught to know their di&s;tance. And as there are different &s;pecies of them, we &s;hould make a prudent &s;electi|on, and not introduce into the hou&s;e great ma&s;tiffs or tall grey hounds; neither mu&s;t we indulge tho&s;e we dome&s;ticate to too great a degree, for in that ca&s;e they will become as trouble&s;ome as cats.</P>
<P>Mrs. Ben&s;on now expre&s;&s;ed her de&s;ire to &s;ee the &s;heep-&s;hearing; on which Mrs. Wil&s;on and her daughter conducted her and Mi&s;s Harriet to the field, where they arrived at the conclu&s;ion of the
<PB N="163" REF="027817_0162_0FD64F3A9A96BB70">
operation; and a very plea&s;ing fight it was to be|hold the&s;e happy creatures, who lately waddled under a heavy, heating load, relieved from their burthen, leaping and fri&s;king with delight, whil&s;t the accumulated wool &s;eemed, as it lay, to promi&s;e comfortable cloathing for many a naked wretch a|mong the human &s;pecies, who, de&s;titute of &s;uch a &s;upply would be in danger of peri&s;hing with cold in the en&s;uing winter. Mi&s;s Harriet ob&s;erved the innocent countenances of the &s;heep and lambs, and &s;aid &s;he thought it was a thou&s;and pities to kill them. It is &s;o, my dear, &s;aid her mamma, but we mu&s;t not always indulge our feelings too far in re&s;pect to animals which are given us for food; all we have to do is to avoid barbarity. It is happy for them that they have no apprehen&s;ion of being killed, and therefore enjoy life in peace and &s;ecuri|ty to the very la&s;t; and when the knife is lifted to their throats, are ignorant of its de&s;tination: and when the fatal blow is once &s;truck, a few &s;truggles put an end to their pain for ever. But come, Mrs. Wil&s;on, will you favour us with a &s;ight of your cows. With plea&s;ure, Madam, they are by this time driven up to be milked. She then conducted her vi&s;itors towards the farm-yard.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="027817_0163_0FD64F3EC8AE36B8">Perhaps, Madam, &s;aid Mrs. Wil&s;on, as they walked along, the young Lady and Gentleman may be afraid of horned cattle? I believe, replied Mrs&middot; Ben&s;on, I may venture to &s;ay, that Harriet has no unrea&s;onable fears of any living creature; it has been my endeavour to guard the minds of my chil|dren again&s;t &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing a weakne&s;s; but whe|ther Frederick's heart has acquired fortitude enough to enable him to venture near &s;o many cows, I can|not tell. O yes, mamma, cried Frederick, I would &s;ooner get up and ride into the farm-yard on the horns of one of them, than run away. Well, we &s;hall &s;oon put your courage to the proof, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on; &s;o come along, Sir.</P>
<P>As for my children, &s;aid Mrs. Wil&s;on, they are remarkably courageous in re&s;pect to animals; all the creatures belonging to us are very harmle&s;s and gentle, which is the natural con&s;equence of kind treatment, and no per&s;on need be afraid of walking in any part of our grounds: but it is difficult to per&s;uade &s;ome people that there is no danger, for they are apt to imagine, that every loo&s;e hor&s;e they &s;ee will gallop over them, and that every creature with horns will gore and to&s;s them. Very true, replied Mrs. Ben&s;on; and I have known many as much afraid of a toad, a frog, or a &s;pider, as if certain death would be the con&s;equence of meeting
<PB N="165" REF="027817_0164_0FD64F43BA6DC768">
them; when if the&s;e per&s;ons would but make u&s;e of their rea&s;on, they would &s;oon be convinced that &s;uch fears are ill-grounded. Frogs and toads are very harmle&s;s creatures, and &s;o far from offering an injury to any human being they may chance to meet, hop away with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, from a dread of being them&s;elves de&s;troyed; and the &s;piders drop &s;uddenly down, with a view of their own pre&s;ervation only; and therefore it is highly ridiculous to be afraid of them. Hor&s;es and oxen are much more formidable creatures; they cer|tainly could do us a great deal of mi&s;chief, if they were con&s;cious of their own &s;uperior &s;trength; but Providence has wi&s;ely ordained that they &s;hould not be &s;o; and having given mankind dominion o|ver them, has inplanted in their nature an awe and dread of the human &s;pecies, which occa&s;ion them to yield &s;ubjection to the Lords of the creation, when they exert their authority in a proper man|ner. It is really a very wonderful thing, Mrs. Wil&s;on, to &s;ee a fine lively hor&s;e &s;ubmitting to the bit and harne&s;s, or a drove of oxen quietly march|ing under the direction of one man!</P>
<P>Pray, mamma, &s;aid Harriet, what do you mean by &s;aying, that man is LORD of the <HI>Creation?</HI> Are all brutes &s;ubject to every man? I cannot compre|hend how this can be. I will endeavour to explain

it to you, my dear, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, the next time we read the Bible toget<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er; at pre&s;ent, I have only time to inform you, that the dread of mankind, which pervails &s;o generally among&s;t the inferior creatures, does not exi&s;t in &s;o high a degree as to render every <HI>individual</HI> animal afraid of every <HI>individual</HI> man; but the human &s;pecies, that is to &s;ay all mankind together, have an undoubted &s;upe|riority and dominion: and there is no &s;pecies of animals which if collected together, mankind could not &s;ubdue; for though inferior to many of them in &s;trength, men va&s;tly exceed them in number, and having the u&s;e of <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> can employ a variety of means to conquer them: and I make no doubt, but was the experiment po&s;&s;ible, to a&s;&s;emble each indi|vidual &s;pecies, in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>whole race of mankind,</HI> which exi&s;t at one time upon the earth, or even an unequal number of them, the dread and fear which is in&s;tinctive in their natures, would operate &s;o powerfully on the hearts of the mo&s;t fe|rocious of them, as to prevent their attempting any conte&s;t.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, and &s;hews at once the goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom of our great CREATOR, that tho&s;e crea|tures, which are the mo&s;t u&s;eful to us, are the ea&s;i|e&s;t tamed; and yield, not only &s;ingly, but in flocks, to mankind, nay even to boys.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="027817_0166_0FD64F45DDB915C8">From what I have &s;aid you mu&s;t perceive that it is a great weakne&s;s for a human being to be afraid of <HI>animals.</HI></P>
<P>By this time the party were advanced pretty near to the farm-yard, and Frederick e&s;pied one of the cows peeping over the gate; on which with a countenance expre&s;&s;ive of fear, he ha&s;tily ran to|wards his mamma and a&s;ked her, whether cows could to&s;s people over gates and hedges? I will not an|&s;wer &s;o &s;illy a que&s;tion, Frederick, &s;aid &s;he; pray look again, and you will percieve that it is impo&s;&s;i|ble for &s;uch large heavy creatures to do &s;o; and the&s;e inclo&s;ures are made on purpo&s;e to confine them within proper bounds. But did not you boa&s;t ju&s;t now, that you could ride on the horns of one of them? That I &s;hall not require you to do, for it would very likely make the creature angry, be|cau&s;e cows are not accu&s;tomed to carry any loads upon their heads; neither would I allow you to run after them with a &s;tick, or to make any attempt to frighten them; but if you approach as a friend, I make no doubt you will be received as &s;uch; &s;o &s;ummon your courage and attend us, the cows will not hurt you, I can a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>Neddy Wil&s;on then began laughing from the idea that a boy &s;hould be afraid of a cow! which made Frederick a&s;hamed of him&s;elf; and quitting his

mamma's gown, by which he had held fa&s;t whil&s;t &s;he was &s;peaking, he laid hold of Neddy's hand, and declared his re&s;olution to go as near the cows as he would. I will not take upon me to &s;ay, that his little heart was perfectly free from palpitation; but that lay in his own bo&s;om, where none could di&s;cover its feelings but him&s;elf; &s;o let us give him credit for as much courage as we can, and acknow|ledge him to be a noble little fellow, in thus tru&s;t|ing him&s;elf among&s;t a number of horned cattle.</P>

<P>THE whole party now entered the farm-yard, where they &s;aw eight fine cows, fat, &s;leek, and beautifully clean, who yielded &s;everal pails of rich milk, the &s;team of which, added to the breath of the cows, ca&s;t a delightful fragrance around. Mrs. Wil&s;on then entreated her company to return to the hou&s;e, where tea was provided, and a delici|ous &s;yllabub.</P>
<P>The farmer now came back, and refre&s;hed him|&s;elf with a cup of ale, which was very comfortable after the fatigues of the day.</P>
<P>I have had, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, great plea&s;ure in viewing your farm, Mr. Wil&s;on, which appears to
<PB N="169" REF="027817_0168_0FD64F4A8E3C7860">
me to afford all the de&s;irable comforts and conve|niencies of life, and I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h a continu|ance of your pro&s;perity. If it is not an impertinent que&s;tion, pray tell me, did you inherit it from your father, or was it purcha&s;ed with the fruits of your own indu&s;try?</P>
<P>Neither my wife nor I have led an idle life, I a&s;|&s;ure you, Madam, replied the farmer; but, next to the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, I think my&s;elf in a great degree indebted to my cattle for my good &s;ucce&s;s. My father left me ma&s;ter of a little farm, with a few acres of land well cropped, three hor&s;es, two cows, &s;ix &s;heep, a &s;ow and pigs a jack-a&s;s, and a few poul|try; the&s;e have gradually multiplied to what you now &s;ee me po&s;&s;e&s;s, be&s;ides numbers that I have &s;old, and I have had fine crops of hay and corn: &s;o that every year I laid by a little money, till I was able to purcha&s;e this farm, which is as good a one as any man &s;hould de&s;ire.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;o uncommon in hearing a farmer attribute part of his &s;ucce&s;s in life to his cattle, that I &s;hould be obliged to you, Mr. Wil|&s;on, &s;aid the Lady, if you would account to me for this circum&s;tance. Mo&s;t readily, Madam, &s;aid he.</P>
<P>When I was a very young man, I heard a fine &s;er|mon from the pulpit, preached by my dear wife's father, on the &s;ubject of &s;hewing mercy to brutes.
<PB N="170" REF="027817_0169_0FD64F4DA49ED120">
which made a great impre&s;&s;ion on my mind; and I have ever &s;ince acted towards all dumb creatures, as I would to mankind, upon the principle of doing as I would be done by. I always con&s;ider every bea&s;t that works for me as my &s;ervant, and entitled to wages; but as the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cannot u&s;e money, I pay them in things of more value to them; and make it a rule, except in ca&s;es of great nece&s;&s;ity, (when corn or hay, for in&s;tance, is likely to be &s;poiled) to let them enjoy re&s;t on the Sabbath-day. I am very cautious of not letting any bea&s;t work beyond its &s;trength, and always give them their food in due &s;ea&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; nor do I ever &s;uffer them to be beat or cruelly u&s;ed. Be&s;ides giving them what I call their daily wages, I indulge them with all the comforts I can afford them. In &s;ummer, when the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day is over, my hor&s;es enjoy them&s;elves in good pa&s;ture; and in winter they are &s;heltered from the inclemencies of the weather in a warm &s;ta|ble. If they get old, I contrive &s;ome ea&s;y ta&s;k for them; and when they can work no longer, let them live without it, till age and infirmities make their lives burthen&s;ome to them&s;elves, when I have them put to as ea&s;y a death as po&s;&s;ible. Though my cows and &s;heep do not work for me, I think them entitled to recompence for the profit I receive from their milk and wool, and endeavour to repay them by the kinde&s;t u&s;age: and even my jack-a&s;s finds
<PB N="171" REF="027817_0170_0FD64F52A29370C0">
mercy from me; for I could not bear to &s;ee &s;uch a u&s;eful creature ill treated; and as for my dogs, I &s;et great &s;tore by them on account of their fidelity.</P>
<P>The&s;e are very excellent rules indeed, Mr. Wil|&s;on, and I wi&s;h they were generally followed; for I believe many bea&s;ts &s;uffer a great deal from the ill-treatment inflicted on them, the hor&s;es in po&s;t-chai&s;es and hackney-coaches in London particular|ly. Yes, Madam, &s;aid the farmer, I have heard &s;o and could tell you &s;uch &s;tories of cruelties exerci&s;ed on brutes in the country, as would quite &s;hock you: and have &s;een in my own family &s;uch an in&s;tance of the ill-effects of neglecting them, as has confirmed me in the notions I learnt from the good &s;ermon I told you of.</P>
<P>I have a brother, whom I at pre&s;ent maintain; my father gave him an equal portion with my&s;elf, but neither he nor his wife were indu&s;trious, nor had they any feeling for dumb creatures. He tru&s;t|ed the care of his hor&s;es to his plough-boys, who u&s;ed to ride them about, let them go without water, and frequently neglect both to feed and clean them; and indeed, he him&s;elf grudged their victuals; &s;o they grew leaner and leaner, and at la&s;t were real|ly killed with hard work and hard living. His cows were kept &s;o badly in the winter, that they &s;oon lo&s;t their milk; and he calves they had, for
<PB N="172" REF="027817_0171_0FD64F52A7E512E0">
want of proper management, died; as did the cows them&s;elves in a &s;hort time afterwards. The &s;heep got a di&s;temper, which &s;oon put an end to them. His pigs being kept in the mo&s;t dirty way in the world, and &s;ometimes without food for two days together, got hide-bound and full of vermin; and his poultry dropped off with the roup and other di&s;orders, till he had none left. The jack-a&s;s u&s;ed to be put to hard drudgery in his own &s;ervice, or let out to draw a &s;and-cart: this exce&s;&s;ive labour, with &s;carcely time allowed him to &s;eek a &s;canty living among&s;t thi&s;tles and hedges, &s;oon put an end to him. The&s;e lo&s;&s;es my brother had no means to repair, for without cattle he could not cultivate his farm and was &s;oon reduced to poverty; and were I not to maintain him, he mu&s;t be a beggar; for thro' want of air and exerci&s;e he lo&s;t his health, and is now incapable of working. His wife died &s;ome years before of an illne&s;s, which was the con&s;equence of indolence and inactivity.</P>
<P>I am much obliged to you for your &s;tory, Mr. Wil&s;on, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, and hope my children will never forget it; for it certainly is a duty to extend our clemency to bea&s;ts and other animals. Nay, we are &s;trictly commanded in the &s;criptures to &s;hew compa&s;&s;ion to the bea&s;ts of others, even to tho&s;e of our enemies: &s;urely, then, tho&s;e which are our own property, and work for us, have a
<PB N="173" REF="027817_0172_0FD64F541E752268">
particular claim to it. There is one cu&s;tom which &s;hocks me very much, and that is pounding the cat|tle; I fancy, Mr. Wil&s;on, you do not practi&s;e that much? Why, Madam, replied he, I &s;hould much rather pound the owners of them, through who&s;e neglect or di&s;hone&s;ty it generally happens that hor|&s;es tre&s;pa&s;s on other people's land. If any bea&s;t accidentally gets into my grounds, I &s;end it home to its owner, for it certainly is no wilful fault in the creature to &s;eek the be&s;t pa&s;ture it can find; but if I have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e his owner turned him in, I then think my&s;elf obliged to do what the law directs in that re&s;pect: but though it is a &s;ecret I am obliged to keep from my neighbours, I may &s;afely confe&s;s to you, Madam, that I have not the heart to let a poor bea&s;t &s;tarve in a pound. As there are no Courts of Ju&s;tice in which they can &s;eek redre&s;s, I erect one for them in my own brea&s;t, where humanity pleads their cau&s;e. I wi&s;h they had &s;uch an advocate in every brea&s;t, Mr. Wil&s;on, &s;aid the Lady: but my watch reminds me that we mu&s;t now take our leave, which I do with many thanks to you and Mrs. Wil&s;on, for your kind en|tertainment and good cheer, and &s;hall be happy to return your civilities at my own hou&s;e, and pray bring your whole family with you.</P>
<P>She then de&s;ired her &s;on and daughter to prepare

for their departure. Frederick was grown &s;o in|timate with little Neddy, that he could &s;carcely be prevailed on to leave him, till he recollected Robin and the Linnet.</P>
<P>As they returned in the coach, Mrs. Ben&s;on re|marked, that Farmer Wil&s;on's &s;tory was enough to make every one who heard it careful of their live &s;tock for their own &s;akes; but, &s;aid &s;he, the plea|&s;ure and advantage will be greatly increa&s;ed, if it is done from a principle of humanity as well as in|tere&s;t. Mi&s;s Ben&s;on an&s;wered, that &s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould neither treat animals ill, nor place her affec|tions on them too &s;trongly. That, my dear, re|plied her good mamma, is the proper medium to be ob&s;erved. The &s;peech you made for the ant, mam|ma, &s;aid Harriet, has &s;carcely ever been out of my head &s;ince: I &s;hould like to hear what you could &s;ay for every live creature we &s;ee. I had need have &s;trong lungs, my dear, to perform &s;uch a ta&s;k as that, replied Mrs. Ben&s;on. I &s;hall, on all proper occa&s;ions, be ready to lend my tongue to the dumb, and to &s;peak for tho&s;e who cannot utter their own &s;orrows and injuries.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time they arrived at home. The maid, to who&s;e care the birds have been entru&s;ted, gave a good account of her charge; and Mi&s;s Harriet and Ma&s;ter Frederick went to bed in peace, after

<P>THE next morning the Redbrea&s;ts attended as u&s;ual, and Robin was &s;till better, but his father began to fear he would never perfectly recover from his accident; however, he kept his apprehen&s;ions to him&s;elf, and &s;uffered the little ones to entertain their lame brother with a relation of what they had &s;een the day before in the orchard. Frederick and Harriet were &s;o diverted with the chattering and chirping of the little things, that they did not mi&s;s the parents &s;ong. When the young ones had &s;taid as long as &s;he thought right, the hen-Redbrea&s;t &s;ummoned them away, and all took leave of Robin, who longed to go with them, but was not able. The father reminded him, that he had great rea&s;on to rejoice in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, con&s;idering all things; on which he re&s;umed his cheerfulne&s;s, and giving a &s;prightly twitter, hopped into Ma&s;ter Fre|derick's hand, which was &s;pread open to receive him.

<P>The Redbrea&s;ts alighted as u&s;ual to drink in the court yard, and were preparing to return to the

orchard, when Flap&s;y expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to &s;ee a lit|tle about the world; for &s;he &s;aid it would be very mopi&s;h to be always confined to the orchard, and Dicky &s;econded her reque&s;t. Peck&s;y replied, that however her curio&s;ity might be excited, &s;he had known &s;o much happine&s;s in the ne&s;t, that &s;he was &s;trongly attached to the paternal &s;pot, and could gladly pa&s;s her life there. The parents both com|mended her contented di&s;po&s;ition; but her father &s;aid, that there was nothing blamable in the inclina|tion Dicky and Flap&s;y di&s;covered for &s;eeing the world, provided it was kept within due bounds, he would readily gratify it: then a&s;king if they were &s;ufficiently refre&s;hed, took wing, and led the way to the neighbouring grove, where he placed his little tribe among&s;t the branches of a venerable oak.</P>
<P>Here their ears were charmed with a mo&s;t en|chanting concert of mu&s;ic. On one tree a Black-bird and a Thru&s;h poured forth their &s;trong melo|dious notes; on another a number of Linnets joined their &s;weet voices: exalted in the air, a Sky-Lark modulated his delightful pipe; whil&s;t a brother of the wood, feated on a cool-refre&s;hing turf, made the grove re-echo with his melody; to the&s;e the Nightingale joined his enchanting lay.

<P>Well, &s;aid the father, your de&s;ire &s;hall be grati|fied; let us take a circuit in this grove, for I wi&s;h you to &s;ee every thing worth ob&s;ervation in every place you go to; and not to fly about the world, as many giddy birds do without the lea&s;t improve|ment from their travels. On this he &s;pread his wings as the &s;ignal of departure, which his family obeyed.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving a parcel of boys creeping &s;ilently along, &s;top, &s;aid he, let us perch on this tree, and &s;ee what the&s;e little Mon&s;ters are about. Scarcely were they &s;eated, when one of the boys mounted an adjacent

tree, and took a ne&s;t of half-fledged Linnets, which he brought in triumph to his companions.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant, a family of thru&s;hes unfortunate|ly chirped, which directed another boy to the place of their habitation; on which he climbed, and ea|gerly &s;iezed the little unfortunate creatures. Ha|ving met with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, they left the grove to exult, at their own homes, over their wretched captives, for ever &s;eparated from their tender pa|rents; who &s;oon came back, laden with the gain of their labour, which they had kindly de&s;tined for the &s;u&s;tenance of their infant broods.</P>
<P>The little Redbrea&s;ts were now &s;pectators of tho&s;e parental agonies which had been formerly de&s;cribed to them; and Peck&s;ey cried out, Who would de&s;ire to live in this grove, who had once experienced the comforts of the orchard? Dicky and Flap&s;y were de&s;irous to depart, being alarmed for their own &s;afety. No, &s;aid the father, let us &s;tay a little longer&mdash;now we will go on. They accordingly took another flight, and &s;aw a man &s;cattering &s;eed upon the ground. See there, &s;aid Dicky, what fine food that man throws down; I dare &s;ay he is &s;ome good creature who is a friend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the feathered race; &s;hall we alight and partake of his bounty? Do not form too ha&s;ty an opinion, Dicky, &s;aid the father; watch here with me a lit|tle while, and then do as you think proper. All

the little ones &s;tretched out their necks, and kept a curious eye fixed on the man. In a few minutes, a number of Sparrows, Chaffinches, and Linnets de&s;cended, and began to regale them&s;elves; but in the mid&s;t of the fea&s;t, a net was &s;uddenly ca&s;t over them, and they were all taken captive. The man, who was a bird catcher by profe&s;&s;ion, called to his a&s;&s;i&s;tant, who brought a cage divided into a num|ber of &s;mall partitions, in which the Linnets and Chaffinches were &s;eparately depo&s;ited. In this di&s;|mal pri&s;on, where they had &s;carcely room to flut|ter, were tho&s;e little creatures confined who lately poured forth their &s;ongs of joy, fearle&s;s of danger. As for the Sparrows, their necks were wrung, and they were put in a bag together. The little Red|brea&s;ts trembled for them&s;elves, and were in great ha&s;te to take wing. Stay, &s;aid the father, Dicky has not yet made acquaintance with this friend of the feathered race. No, &s;aid Dicky, nor do I de|&s;ire it; defend me, and all who are dear to me, from &s;uch friends as the&s;e! Well, &s;aid the father, learn from this in&s;tance, never to form an ha&s;ty judgment, nor to put your&s;elf into the power of &s;trangers, who offer you favours you have no right to expect from their hands.</P>
<P>Indeed, my love, &s;aid the mother bird, I am ve|ry auxious to get home; I have not lately been u&s;ed to be long ab&s;ent from it, and every excur&s;ion I

Come let us vi&s;it another part of the grove; I am acquainted with its inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es. His mate acquie&s;ced, and they proceed|ed on their journey.</P>
<P>At length, the father ha&s;tily called out, Turn this way! turn this way! The whole party obey|ed the word of command, and found the good ef|fects of their obedience; for in an in&s;tant they &s;aw a fla&s;h of fire, a thick &s;moke followed it, and im|mediately they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ard a dreadful &s;ound, and &s;aw a young Red&s;tart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bleeding to the ground, on which he &s;truggled ju&s;t long enough to cry, Oh! my dear father! why did I not li&s;ten to your kind ad|monitions, which I now find too late, were the dictates of tenderne&s;s! and then expired.</P>
<P>The little Redbrea&s;ts were &s;truck with con&s;terna|tion at this dreadful accident; and Peck&s;y, who recovered the &s;oone&s;t, begged her father would in|form her by what means the Red&s;tart was killed. He was &s;hot to death, &s;aid he; and had you not followed my directions, it might have been the fate of every one of you: therefore, let it be a le&s;&s;on to you, to follow every injunction of your parents with the &s;ame readine&s;s for the future. You may

<P>They all &s;aid they would ob&s;erve implicit obedi|ence. Do &s;o, &s;aid he; but in order to do this, you mu&s;t al&s;o remember to practice, in our ab&s;ence, what we enjoin you when pre&s;ent. For in&s;tance, &s;ome kinds of food are very prejudicial to your health, which we would not on any account, let you ta&s;te when we are by: the&s;e you mu&s;t not in|dulge in when away from us, whatever any bird may &s;ay in recommendation of them. Neither mu&s;t you engage in any dangerous enterprize, which others, who have natural &s;trength or acquired a|gility, go through with &s;afety; nor &s;hould you go to any places which we have pointed out as dan|gerous, nor join any company which we have for|bid you to make acquaintance with. This poor Red&s;tart might have avoided his fate; for I heard his father, when I was la&s;t in the grove, advi&s;e him
<PB N="182" REF="027817_0181_0FD64F68CFCDF1B8">
not to fly about by him&s;elf, till he had &s;hewn him the dangers of the world. Peck&s;y an&s;wered that &s;he know the value of parental in&s;truction &s;o well, that &s;he certainly would trea&s;ure up in her heart every maxim of it; and the others promi&s;ed to do the &s;ame: but, &s;aid Flap&s;y, I cannot under&s;tand the nature of the accident which cau&s;ed the death of the Red|&s;tart. Neither can I explain it to you, my dear, &s;aid the father; I only know that it is a very com|mon practice for &s;ome men to carry in&s;truments, from which they di&s;charge what proves fatal to many a bird; but I have, by attentive ob&s;ervation learnt how to evade the mi&s;chief. Whenever I go from the orchard, I always get upon a high tree and look all around me; if I &s;ee any gunners I take a different cour&s;e (the thickne&s;s of the underwood prevented my di&s;covering him who &s;hot the Red|&s;tart.) I al&s;o carefully avoid a&s;&s;ociating with tho&s;e birds, which do mi&s;chief to the property of mankind, for tho&s;e that join with thieves and ravagers de&s;erve, and mu&s;t ju&s;tly expect to &s;hare their fate: let me therefore advi&s;e you to be particularly careful to keep proper company, and gain an hone&s;t character, as it will en&s;ure you the good opinion of others. But come, let us de&s;cend, as we may do it with &s;afety, and refre&s;h our&s;elves a little, and then will &s;ee if we cannot find a place where you may have

<P>THE father led the way, and in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time he and his family arrived at the e&s;tate of a Gentleman, who, having a plentiful for|tune, endeavoured to collect all that was curious in art and nature, for the amu&s;ement of his own mind, and the gratification of others. He had a hou&s;e like a palace furni&s;hed with every expen&s;ive rarity; his gardens, to which the Redbrea&s;ts took their flight, were laid out in &s;uch a manner as to afford the mo&s;t delightful variety to the eye. Among&s;t other articles of ta&s;te were an aviary and a mena|gery. The former was built like a temple, enclo&s;ed with bra&s;s wire; the frame-work was painted green and ornamented with carving gilt; in the middle a fountain continually threw up fre&s;h water, which
<PB N="184" REF="027817_0183_0FD64F6B6E7CECB8">
fell into a ba&s;on who&s;e brink was enamelled with flowers; at one end were partitions for birds ne&s;ts, and troughs containing various kinds of &s;eed, and materials for building ne&s;ts; this part was carefully &s;heltered from every inclemency of weather, and numbers of perches were planted in different parts of the aviary, and it was &s;urrounded by a mo&s;t beautiful &s;hrubbery.</P>
<P>A habitation like this, in which all the conveni|encies of life &s;eemed to be collected, where abun|dance was &s;upplied without toil, where each gay &s;ong&s;ter might &s;ing him&s;elf to repo&s;e in the mid&s;t of ea&s;e and plenty, &s;afe from the dangers of the woods, appeared to our young travellers de&s;irable beyond all the &s;ituations in the world, and Dicky expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t de&s;ire to be admitted into it. Well, &s;aid the father, let us not determine ha&s;tily, it will be advi&s;eable fir&s;t to enquire whether its inhabitants are really happy, before you make intere&s;t to be|come one of the number; place your&s;elf by me in this &s;hrub, and whil&s;t we re&s;t our&s;elves we &s;hall have an opportunity of ob&s;erving what pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t bird that attracted their notice was a Dove, who &s;at cooing by him&s;elf in a corner in ac|cents &s;o gentle and &s;weet, that a &s;tranger to his language would have li&s;tened to him with delight; but the Redbrea&s;ts, who under&s;tood their import, heard them with &s;ympathetic concern.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="027817_0184_0FD64F6E0FBBAA08">"Oh, my dear, my beloved mate," &s;aid he, "am I then divided from you for ever? What avails it, that I am furni&s;hed here with all the ele|gancies and luxuries of life? Deprived from your company, I have no enjoyment of them; the hum|ble&s;t mor&s;el, though gained with toil and danger, would be infinitely preferable to me if &s;hared with you. Here I am &s;hut up for the remainder of my days, in &s;ociety for which I have no reli&s;h, whil&s;t &s;he, who has hitherto been the beloved partner of all my joys, is for ever &s;eparated from me! In vain will you, with painful wing, pur&s;ue your anxious &s;earch in que&s;t of me! never, never more, &s;hall I bring you the welcome refre&s;hment; never &s;hall I hear your &s;oothing voice, and delight in the &s;oft murmurs of the infant pair, which you hatched with &s;uch care, and nur&s;ed with &s;uch tenderne&s;s! No, my beloved ne&s;tlings, never will your wretched fa|ther be at liberty to guide your flight and in&s;truct you in the duties of your &s;tation!"

<P>This Dove is not happy, however, &s;aid the hen Redbrea&s;t to her mate, and no wonder: but let us

attend to the notes of that Lark. His eyes were turned up towards the &s;ky, he fluttered his wings, he &s;trained his throat, and would to a human eye, have appeared in raptures of joy; but the Red|brea&s;ts perceived that he was inflamed with rage. "And am I to be con&s;tantly confined in this horrid place?" &s;ang he. "Is my upward flight to be im|peded by bras and wires? Mu&s;t I no longer &s;oar to|wards that bright luminary, and make the arch of heaven re&s;ound with my &s;inging? &s;hall I cea&s;e to be the herald of the morn, or mu&s;t I be &s;o in this con|tracted &s;phere?

Take your delicious dainties, re&s;erve your flowing &s;tream for tho&s;e who can reli&s;h them, but give me liberty. But why do I addre&s;s my&s;elf to you who are heed|le&s;s of my mi&s;ery?"

I can't help thinking &s;till, replied Dicky, that it is a charm|ing retreat, and mu&s;t be very comfortable to have every thing provided for one's u&s;e. Well, &s;aid the father, let us move, and ob&s;erve tho&s;e Linnets who are building their ne&s;t. Accordingly they flew to a tree, who&s;e branches formed a part of the &s;helter of the aviary, where they ea&s;ily heard, without be|ing ob&s;erved, all that pa&s;&s;ed in it.</P>
<P>"Come," &s;aid one of the Linnets, "let us go on with our work, and fini&s;h the ne&s;t; though it will be rather a melancholy ta&s;k to hatch a &s;et of little pri&s;oners.

What plea&s;ure have we experienced in plucking a bit of wool from a &s;heep's back, in &s;earch|ing for mo&s;s, in &s;electing the be&s;t feather where numbers were left to our choice, in &s;topping to re&s;t

In&s;tead of the &s;ongs a joy we formerly heard from every &s;pray, our ears are con&s;tantly annoyed with the &s;ound of mournful lamentations, tran&s;ports of rage, or mur|murs of di&s;content. Could we reconcile our&s;elves to the lo&s;s of liberty, it is impo&s;&s;ible to be happy here, unle&s;s we could harden our hearts to every &s;ympathetic feeling."</P>
<P>"True," &s;aid his mate; "yet I am re&s;olved to try what patience, re&s;ignation, and employment will effect; and hope, as our young ones will never know what liberty is, they will not pine as we do for it." Saying this &s;he picked up a &s;traw, her mate followed the example, and they pur&s;ued their work.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant a hen Goldfinch brought forth her brood, who were full fledged. Come, &s;aid &s;he, my ne&s;tlings, u&s;e your wings; I have taught you to fly in all directions. She &s;aying, the little ones divid|ed one flew upwards; but emulous to out do a little

<P>As &s;oon as he recovered, "Why cannot I &s;oar as I &s;ee other birds do? &s;aid he. "Alas!" cried the mother, "we are in a place of confinement; we are &s;hut up and can never get out; but here is food in abundance, and every other nece&s;&s;ary." "Never get out?" exclaimed the whole brood, "then adieu to happine&s;s!" She attempted to &s;ooth them, but in vain.</P>
<P>The little Redbrea&s;ts rejoiced in their liberty, and Dicky gave up the de&s;ire of living in the aviary, and wi&s;hed to be gone. Stop, &s;aid the father, let us fir&s;t hear what tho&s;e Canaries are &s;aying.</P>
<P>The Canaries had almo&s;t compleated their ne&s;t. "How fortunate is our lot," &s;aid the hen bird "in being placed in this aviary! How preferable is it to the &s;mall cage we built in la&s;t year? Yes," replied her mate; "yet how comfortable was that in compari&s;on to the &s;till &s;maller ones in which we were once &s;eperately confined. For my part, I have no wi&s;h to fly abroad, for I &s;hould neither know what to do, nor where to go; and it &s;hall be my endeavour to in&s;pire my young ones with the &s;ame &s;entiments I feel. Indeed, we owe the high|e&s;t

gratitude to tho&s;e who make &s;uch kind provi&s;ion for a &s;et of foreigners, who have no re&s;ources but their bounty; and my be&s;t lays &s;hall be devoted to them. Nothing is wanting to compleat the happi|ne&s;s of this place, but to have other kinds of birds excluded. Poor creatures! it mu&s;t be ve|ry mortifying to them to be &s;hut up here, and &s;ee others of their own kind enjoying freedom. No wonder they are perpetually quarrelling; for my part, I &s;incerely pity them, and am ready to &s;ub|mit to the occa&s;ional in&s;ults and affronts I meet with out of compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>You now concieve, Dicky, &s;aid the cock Red|brea&s;t, that this place is not, as you &s;uppo&s;ed the region of perfect happine&s;s; you may al&s;o ob&s;erve, that it is not the abode of univer&s;al wretchedne&s;s. It is by no means de&s;irable to be &s;hut up for life, let the place of confinement be ever &s;o &s;plendid; but &s;hould it at any time be your lot to be caught and impri&s;oned, which may po&s;&s;ibly be the ca&s;e, adopt the &s;entiments of the Linnet and Canary Bird: em|ployment will pa&s;s away many an hour that would have been a heavy load if &s;pent in grief and anxi|ety; and reflections on the ble&s;&s;ings and comforts that are &s;till in your power, will le&s;&s;en your regret for tho&s;e which are lo&s;t. But come, pick up &s;ome of the &s;eeds which are &s;cattered on the out&s;ide of

<P>As &s;oon as they had regaled them&s;eves with the &s;uperfluities of the feathered captives, they took their flight to a different part of the garden, in which was a menagery.</P>
<P>The menagery con&s;i&s;ted of a number of pens, built round a gra&s;s plat; in each was a pan of wa|ter, a &s;ort of box, containing a bed or ne&s;t, a trough for food, and a perch. In every pen were confined a pair of birds, and every pair was either of a differ|ent &s;pecies, or di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome beautiful va|riety either of form or plumage. The wooden bars which were put in the front, were painted partly green and partly white, which dazzled the &s;ight at the fir&s;t glance, and &s;o attracted the eyes, that there was no &s;eeing what was behind without going clo&s;e up to the pens.</P>
<P>The little Redbrea&s;ts knew not what &s;ight to ex|pect, and begged their parents to gratify their cu|curio&s;ity. Well, follow me, &s;aid the father; but I believe we mu&s;t alight upon the cro&s;s-bars, or you will not be able to examine the beauties of the&s;e fowls. They did &s;o, and in the fir&s;t pen was a pair of Partridges. The &s;ize of the&s;e birds &s;o great|ly exceeding their own, a&s;toni&s;hed them all; but notwith&s;tanding this, the amiable Peck&s;y was quite

interre&s;ted with their mode&s;t gentle appearance, and &s;aid, &s;he thought no one could ever wi&s;h to in|jure them. True, Peck&s;y, replied the father, they have from the harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s of their di&s;po&s;ition, a natural claim to tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion; and yet I believe there are few birds who meet with le&s;s; for I have ob&s;erved that numbers &s;hare the &s;ame fate as the Red&s;tart, which you &s;aw die in the grove. I have my&s;elf &s;een many put to death that way. For a long time I was exce&s;&s;ively puz|zled on account of this fatality, and re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible to gratify my curio&s;ity. At length I &s;aw a man kill two and take them away. This very man had &s;hewn me great kindne&s;s, in feeding me, when I fir&s;t left my father's ne&s;t; &s;o I had no ap|prehen&s;ion of his doing me an injury, and re&s;olved to follow him. When he arrived at his own hou&s;e I &s;aw him deliver the victims of his cruelty to ano|ther per&s;on, who hung them up together by the legs in a place which had a variety of other dead things in it, the &s;ight of which, &s;hocked me ex|ceedingly, and I could &s;tay no longer. I therefore flew back to the field in which I had &s;een the mur|der committed; and in &s;earching about &s;ound th ne&s;t belonging to the poor creatures in which were &s;everal young ones ju&s;t hatched, who in a &s;hort time were &s;tarved to death.

<P>When the next morning arrived, I went again to &s;ee after the dead Partridges, and found them hanging as before; and this was the ca&s;e the day after; but the following morning I &s;aw a boy &s;tripping all their feathers off. As &s;oon as he had compleated this horrid operation, a woman took them, whom I ventured to follow, as the window of the place &s;he entered &s;tood open; where to my a&s;toni&s;hment, I beheld her twi&s;t their wings about, and fa&s;ten them to their &s;ides, then cro&s;s their legs upon their brea&s;ts, and run &s;omething through their bodies. After this &s;he put them before a place, which glowed with a brightne&s;s &s;omething re&s;embling the &s;etting &s;un, which, on the woman's retiring, I approached, and found intolerably hot; I therefore made a ha&s;ty retreat; but re&s;olving to know the end of the Partridges, kept hovering a|bout the hou&s;e; and at la&s;t looking into a window, I &s;aw them &s;moking hot, &s;et before the man who mur|dered them, and was accompanied by &s;everal others; all of whom eyed them with as much delight, as I have &s;een any of you di&s;cover at the &s;ight of the fine&s;t worm or in&s;ect that could be procured. In an in|&s;tant

after this, the poor Partridges were divided, limb from limb, and each one of the party pre&s;ent had his &s;hare, till every bone was picked. There were &s;ome other things devoured in the &s;ame man|ner: from which I learnt, that men feed on birds and other animals, as we do on tho&s;e little crea|tures which are de&s;tined for our &s;u&s;tenance, only they do not eat them alive. Pray, father, &s;aid Dicky, do they eat Redbrea&s;ts? I believe not, re|plied he; but I have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e they make many a meal on Sparrows, for I have beheld va&s;t numbers of them killed.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant their attention was attracted by one of the Partridges in the pen, who thus addre&s;|&s;ed his mate.</P>
<P>"Well, my love, as there is no chance for our being &s;et at liberty, I think we may as well pre|pare our ne&s;t, that you may depo&s;it your eggs in it. The employment of hatching and rai&s;ing your little ones will, at lea&s;t, mitigate the weari&s;omene&s;s of confinement, and I promi&s;e my&s;elf many happy days yet; for as we are &s;o well fed and attended, I think we may form hopes that our offspring will al&s;o be provided for; and though they will not be at liberty to range about as we formerly did, they will avoid many of tho&s;e terrors and anxieties to which our race are frequently expo&s;ed it one &s;ea&s;on

of the year in particular." "I am very ready to follow your advice," &s;aid the hen Partridge, "and the bu&s;ine&s;s will &s;oon be compleated, for the ne&s;t is in a manner made for us, it only wants a little adju&s;ting; I will therefore &s;et about it imme|diately, and will no longer wa&s;te the hours in fruit|le&s;s lamentations, &s;ince I am convinced, that <HI>content</HI> will render every &s;ituation ea&s;y, in which we can enjoy the company of our deare&s;t friends, and ob|tain the nece&s;&s;aries of life." So &s;aying, &s;he retired into the place provided for the purpo&s;e on which &s;he was now intent, and her mate followed, in or|der to lend her all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power.</P>
<P>I am very glad, &s;aid the hen Redbrea&s;t, that my young ones have had an opportunity of &s;eeing &s;uch an example as this. You now under&s;tand what be|nefit it is of to have a temper of re&s;ignation; more than half the evils of life, I am well convinced, ari&s;e from fretfulne&s;s and di&s;content; and would e|very one, like the&s;e Partridges, try to make the be&s;t of their condition, we &s;hall hear but few com|plaints; for there are much fewer <HI>real</HI> than <HI>imagi|nary</HI> misfortunes. But come, let us take a peep into the next pen. Here they beheld a pair of fine Phea&s;ants, who were quietly picking up &s;ome grain that was &s;cattered for them; from which might be inferred, that they had, like the Partridges, recon|ciled
<PB N="196" REF="027817_0195_0FD64F87D93BE278">
them&s;elves to their lot. The little Redbrea&s;ts were much plea&s;ed with the beauty of the cock bird; but as there was no conver&s;ation to be heard here, their parents de&s;ired them to fly on; as plea&s;ures, by which the eye only was amu&s;ed, were not de|&s;erving of long attention.</P>
<P>They accordingly hopped to the next partition, in which were confined a pair of penciled Phea&s;ants. Flap&s;y was quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elighted with the elegance of their form, and the beauty of their plumage, and could have &s;taid the whole day looking at them; but as the&s;e birds were al&s;o tame and contented, nothing further could be learnt here, than a con|firmation of what the Partridges had taught. Our travellers therefore proceeded &s;till farther, and found a pair of gold Phea&s;ants. Their &s;plendid ap|pearance &s;truck the young Redbrea&s;ts with a&s;toni&s;h|ment, and rai&s;ed &s;uch &s;entiments of re&s;pect, that they were even fearful of approaching birds, which they e&s;teemed as &s;o much &s;uperior to them&s;elves: but their father de&s;iring they would never form a judgment of birds from a glittering out&s;ide, placed his family where they had an opportunity of ob|&s;erving, that this &s;plendid pair had but little in|trin&s;ic merit. They were proud of their fine plu|mage, and their employment was walking back|wards and forwards to di&s;play it; and &s;ometimes
<PB N="197" REF="027817_0196_0FD64F8D766AC558">
they endeavoured to pu&s;h through the bars of their pri&s;on, that they might get abroad to &s;hew their rich plumage to the world, and exult over tho&s;e who were, in this re&s;pect, inferior to them. How hard, &s;aid one of them, is it to be &s;hut up here, where there are no other birds to admire us, and where we have no little ugly creatures to ridicule.</P>
<P>If &s;uch are your de&s;ires, &s;aid the hen Redbrea&s;t, I am &s;ure you are happier here than at liberty; for you would by your proud affected airs, excite the contempt of every bird who has right &s;entiments, and con&s;equently meet with continual mortification, to which even the uglie&s;t might contribute.</P>
<P>Peck&s;y de&s;ired to know if all fine birds were proud and affected? By no means, replied her mother; you ob&s;erved the other two pair of Phea&s;ants, who were, in my opinion nearly equal to the&s;e for beau|ty and elegance. How ea&s;y and una&s;&s;uming are they, and how much are their charms improved by the graces of humility! I often wonder that any bird &s;hould indulge it&s;elf in pride. What have &s;uch little creatures as we to boa&s;t of? The large&s;t &s;pecies among&s;t us is very inferior to many animals we &s;ee in the world, and man is lord over the greate&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t even of the&s;e. Nay, man him&s;elf has no cau&s;e to be <HI>proud;</HI> for he is &s;ubject

to death as well as the meane&s;t creature in the world; as I have had opportunities to ob&s;erve. But come, the day wears away, let us view the other parts of this inclo&s;ure.</P>
<P>On this the father conducted his family to a va|riety of pens, in which were different &s;orts of fo|reign birds, of whom he could give but little ac|count; therefore would not &s;uffer his young ones to &s;tand gazing at them long, le&s;t they &s;hould im|bibe injurious notions on them: e&s;pecially when he heard Dicky cry out, as he left the la&s;t pen,&mdash;I dare &s;ay that Stork is a very cruel voracious creature; I make no doubt but he would eat us all one after the other if he could get at us. Take care, Dicky, &s;aid the father, how you form an ill opinion of any one on &s;light grounds. You cannot po&s;&s;ibly tell what the character of this Stork is, merely from his appearance; you are a &s;tranger to his language, and cannot &s;ee the di&s;po&s;ition of his heart. If you give way to a &s;u&s;picious temper, your own little brea&s;t will be in a &s;tate of con&s;tant perturbation; you will ab&s;olutely exclude your&s;elf from the ble&s;|&s;ings of &s;ociety, and will be &s;hunned and de&s;pi&s;ed by every bird of every kind. This Stork, whom you thus cen&s;ure, is far from de&s;erving your ill opinion. He would do you no harm, and is re|markable for his filial affection. I &s;aw him taken pri&s;oner. He was carrying his aged father on his
<PB N="199" REF="027817_0198_0FD76EE9F7B1C830">
back, whom he had for a long time fed and comfort|ed: the weight of his precious burden impeded his flight; and being at length wearied with it, he de|&s;cended to the ground to re&s;t him&s;elf, when a cruel man, who was out on the bu&s;ine&s;s of bird catching, threw a net over them, and then &s;eized him by the neck. His poor father, who was before worn out with age and infirmities, unable to bear this cala|mity, therefore fell from his back and in&s;tantly ex|pired. This Stork, after ca&s;ting a look of angui&s;h on his dear parent, which I &s;hall never forget, turn|ed with fury on his per&s;ecutor, whom he beat with his wings with all the &s;trength he had; but it was in vain to contend with a being &s;o much more power|ful than him&s;elf, and, in &s;pite of all his exertions, he was conveyed to this place. But come, let us pick up a little refre&s;hment, and then return to the orchard. Saying this, he alighted on the ground, as did his mate and her family, where they met with a plentiful repa&s;t in the provi&s;ions which had been accidentally &s;cattered by the per&s;on, who&s;e employment it was to bring food for the inhabitants of the menagery. When they had &s;ufficiently re|galed them&s;elves, all parties gladly returned to the ne&s;t, and every heart rejoiced in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of liberty and peace.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>FOR three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days nothing remarkable happened, either at Mr. Ben&s;on's or the Red|brea&s;ts ne&s;t. The little family came daily to the breakfa&s;t-table, and Robin daily recovered from his accident, though not &s;ufficiently to fly well; but Dicky, Flap&s;y, and Peck&s;y continued &s;o healthy, and improved &s;o fa&s;t that they required no further care; and the third morning after their tour to the grove, &amp;c. they did not commit the lea&s;t error. When they retired from the parlour into the court|yard, to which Robin accompanied them, the father expre&s;&s;ed great delight, that they were at length able to &s;hift for them&s;elves. And now a wonderful charge took place in his own heart. That ardent affection for his young, which had hitherto made him, for their &s;akes, patient of toil, and fearle&s;s of danger, was on a &s;udden quinched&punc; but from the goodne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, he &s;till felt a kind of &s;olici|tude for their further welfare; therefore called them around him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> addre&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, my dear young ones, that from the time you left the egg-&s;hell, till the pre&s;ent in&s;tant, both your mother and I nouri&s;hed you with the tendere&s;t love. We have taught you all the arts of life which are nece&s;&s;ary to procure
<PB N="201" REF="027817_0200_0FD6259D11DD0750">
you &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and pre&s;erve you from danger. We have &s;hewn you a variety of characters in the dif|ferent cla&s;&s;es of birds; and pointed out tho&s;e which are to be imitated, and tho&s;e which are to be &s;hun|ned. You mu&s;t now &s;hift for your&s;elves; but before we part, let me repeat my admonition, to u&s;e in|du&s;try, avoid contention, cultivate peace, and be contented with your condition. Let none of your own &s;pecies excel you in any amiable quality, for want of your endeavours to equal the be&s;t; and do your duty in every relation of life, as we have done ours by you. Prefer a calm retirement to the gay &s;cenes of levity and di&s;&s;ipation, for there the greate&s;t degree of happine&s;s is to be found. You, Robin, I would advi&s;e, on account of your infirmity, to at|tach your&s;elf to Mr. Ben&s;on's family, where you have been &s;o kindly cheri&s;hed."</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he thus &s;pake, his mate &s;tood by, who finding the &s;ame change beginning to take place in her own brea&s;t, &s;he viewed her family with tender regret; and when he cea&s;ed, cried out, "Adieu ye dear objects of my late cares and &s;olicitude! may ye never more &s;tand in need of a mother's a&s;&s;i&s;tance! Though nature now di&s;mi&s;&s;es me from the arduous ta&s;k, which I have long daily performed, I rejoice not, but would gladly continue my toil, for the &s;ake of its attendant plai&s;ures. Oh! delightful &s;enti|ments of maternal love, how can I part with you?
<PB N="202" REF="027817_0201_0FD625A3AC2ABB70">
Let me, my ne&s;tlings, give you a la&s;t embrace." Then &s;preading her wings, &s;he folded them &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively to her bo&s;om, and in&s;tantly recovered her tranquility. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch young one expre&s;&s;ed its grateful thanks to both father and mother, and with the&s;e acknowledgements filial affection expired in their brea&s;ts; in&s;tead of which, a re&s;pectful friend&s;hip &s;ucceeded. Thus was that tender tie di&s;&s;olved, which had hitherto bound this little family toge|ther; for the parents had performed their duty, and the young ones had no need of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rther a&s;&s;i&s;|tance.</P>
<P>The old Redbrea&s;ts having now only them&s;elves to provide for, re&s;olved to be no longer burthen&s;ome to their benefactors; and after pouring forth their gratitude in the mo&s;t lively &s;trains, they took their flight together, re&s;olving never to &s;eparate. Every care now vani&s;hed, and their little hearts felt no &s;entiments but the&s;e of cheerfulne&s;s and joy. They ranged the fields and gardens, &s;ipped at the coole&s;t &s;prings, and indulged them&s;elves in the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, joining their cheerful notes with tho&s;e of other gay chori&s;ters, who animate and heighten the delightful &s;cenes of rural life.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t morni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g that the old Redbrea&s;ts were mi&s;&s;ing from Mrs. Ben&s;on's breakfa&s;t-table, Frede|rick and his &s;i&s;ter were greatly alarmed for their &s;afety&punc; but their mamma &s;aid, &s;he was of opinion
<PB N="203" REF="027817_0202_0FD625A52BDD6690">
that they had left their ne&s;tlings; as it was the nature of animals in general to di&s;mi&s;s their young, as &s;oon as they were able to provide for them&s;elves. That is very &s;trange, replied Mi&s;s Harriet; I won|der what would become of my brother and me, were you and papa to &s;erve us &s;o? And is a boy of &s;ix, or a girl of eleven years old, capable of &s;hift|ing for them&s;elves? &s;aid her mamma. No, my dear child, you have need of a much longer continuance of our care than birds and other animals; and therefore GOD has ordained that parental affection, when once awakened, &s;hould always remain in the human brea&s;t, unle&s;s extingui&s;hed by the undutiful behaviour of the child.</P>
<P>And &s;hall we &s;ee the old Red&s;trea&s;ts no more? cried Frederick. I do not know that you will, re|plied Mrs. Ben&s;on, though it is not unlikely that they may vi&s;it us again in the winter; but let not their ab&s;ence grieve you, my love, for I dare &s;ay they are very &s;afe and happy.</P>
<P>At that in&s;tant the young ones arrived, and met with a very joyful reception. The amu&s;ement they afforded to Ma&s;ter Ben&s;on, reconciled him to the lo&s;s of their parents; but Harriet declared, &s;he could not help being &s;orry that they were gone. I &s;hall, for the future mamma &s;aid &s;he, take a great deal of notice of animals; for I have had much en|tertainment in ob&s;erving the ways of the&s;e Robins
<PB N="204" REF="027817_0203_0FD64F91619C1C58">
I highly approve your re&s;olution, my dear, &s;aid Mrs. Ben&s;on, and hope the occa&s;ional in&s;truction I have at different times given you, has furni&s;hed you with general ideas re&s;pecting the proper treatment of animals. I will now inform you upon what prin|ciples the rules of conduct I pre&s;cribe to my&s;elf on this &s;ubject are founded.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider that the &s;ame almighty and good GOD, who created mankind, made all other living crea|tures likewi&s;e; and appointed them their different ranks in the creation, that they might form together a community, receiving and conferring reciprocal benefits.</P>
<P>There is no doubt that the Almighty de&s;igned all beings for happine&s;s, proportionable to the fa|culties he endued them with; therefore whoever wantonly de&s;troys that happine&s;s, acts contrary to the will of his Maker.</P>
<P>The world we live in &s;eems to have been princi|pally de&s;igned for the u&s;e and comfort of mankind, who, by the Divine appointment, have dominion over the inferior creatures; in the exerci&s;e of which, it is certainly their duty to imitate the <HI>&s;upreme Lord of the Univer&s;e,</HI> by being merciful to the utmo&s;t of their power. They are endued with rea&s;on, which enables them to di&s;cover the different natures of brutes, the faculties they po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s, and how they may be made &s;erviceable to the world; and as
<PB N="205" REF="027817_0204_0FD64F9257587C78">
bea&s;ts cannot apply the&s;e faculties to their own u&s;e in &s;o exten&s;ive a way, and numbers of them (being unable to provide for their own &s;u&s;tenance) are in|debted to men for many of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, men have an undoubted right to their labour in return.</P>
<P>Several other kinds of animals, which are &s;u&s;tain|ed at the expence of mankind, cannot labour for them; from &s;uch they have a natural claim to what|ever they can &s;upply towards the food and raiment of their benefactors; and therefore when we take the wool and milk of the flocks and herds we take no more than our due, and what they can very well &s;pare; as they &s;eem to have an over-abundance given them, that they may be able to return their obligations to us.</P>
<P>Some creatures have nothing to give us but their own bodies: the&s;e have been expre&s;sly de&s;tined, by the <HI>Supreme Governor,</HI> as food for mankind, and he has appointed an extraordinary increa&s;e of them for this very purpo&s;e; &s;uch an increa&s;e, as would be very injurious to us if all were &s;uffered to live. The&s;e we have an undoubted right to kill&punc; but we &s;hould make their &s;hort lives as comfortable as po&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P>Other creatures &s;eem to be of no particular u&s;e to mankind, but as they &s;erve to furni&s;h our minds
<PB N="206" REF="027817_0205_0FD64F9640506220">
with contemplations on the wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s of GOD, and to exhilarate our &s;pirits by their cheerfulne&s;s; the&s;e &s;hould not be wantonly kil|led, nor treated with the lea&s;t degree of cruelty, but &s;hould be at full liberty to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings a&s;&s;igned them; unle&s;s they abound to &s;uch a degree, as to become injurious, by devouring the food which is de&s;igned for man, or for animals more immedia|tely beneficial to him, whom it is his duty to pro|tect.</P>
<P>Some animals, &s;uch as wild bea&s;ts, &s;erpents, &amp;c. are in their natures ferocious, noxious, or venemous, and capable of injuring the health, or even of de|&s;troying the lives of men, and other creatures of a higher rank than them&s;elves: the&s;e, if they leave the &s;ecret abodes which are allotted them, and become offen&s;ive, certainly may with ju&s;tice be killed.</P>
<P>In a word, my dear, we &s;hould endeavour to re|gulate our regards, according to the utility and ne|ce&s;&s;ities of every living creature with which we are any way connected; and con&s;equently &s;hould pre|fer the happine&s;s of <HI>mankind</HI> to that of any <HI>animal</HI> whatever. Next to the&s;e (who being partakers of the &s;ame nature with our&s;elves, are more properly our <HI>fellow creatures</HI>) we &s;hould con&s;ider our cattle and dome&s;tic animals, and take care to &s;upply every

For my own part, I never willingly put to death, or cau&s;e to be put to death, any creature but when there is a real nece&s;&s;ity for it; and have my food dre&s;&s;ed in a plain manner, that no more lives may be &s;acrificed for me, than nature requires for my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.

<P>AS the old Robins, who were Hero and Heroine of my tale, are made happy it is time for me to put an end to it: but my young readers will doubtle&s;s wi&s;h to know the &s;equel of the hi&s;tory, I &s;hall therefore inform them of it in as few words as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Harriet followed her mamma's precepts and example, and grew up an <HI>univer&s;al Benefactre&s;s</HI> to all people, and all creatures, with whom &s;he was any ways connected.</P>
<P>Frederick was educated upon the &s;ame plan, and and was never known to be cruel to animals, or to treat them with an improper degree of fondne&s;s: he was al&s;o remarkable for his benevolence, &s;o as to de&s;erve and obtain the character of a GOOD MAN.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Lucy Jenkins was quite reformed by Mrs. Ben&s;on's lecture, and her friend's example; but her brother continued his practice of exerci&s;ing barba|rities on a variety of unfortunate animals, till he went to &s;chool, where having no opportunity of do|ing &s;o, he gratified his malignant di&s;po&s;ition on his &s;chool-fellows, and made it his diver&s;ion to pull the hair, pinch, and teaze the younger boys; and by the time he became a man had &s;o hardened his

In this manner he lived for &s;ome years; at length, as he was inhumanly beating and &s;pur|ring a fine hor&s;e, merely becau&s;e it did not go a fa&s;ter pace than it was able to do, the poor crea|ture, in its efforts to evade his blows, threw his brabarous rider, who was killed on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>Farmer Wil&s;on's pro&s;perity increa&s;ed with every &s;ucceeding year, and he acquired a plentiful for|tune, with which he gave portions to each of his children, as opportunities offered, for &s;ettling them in the world; and he and his wife lived to a good old age, beloved and re&s;pected by all who knew them.</P>
<P>Mrs. Addis lo&s;t her parrot, by the di&s;order with which it was attacked whil&s;t Mrs. Ben&s;on was vi&s;it|ing at the hou&s;e, and before &s;he had recovered the &s;hock of this <HI>misfortune,</HI> as &s;he called it, her grief was renewed by the death of the old lap-dog&punc; About a year afterwards her monkey e&s;caped to the top of the hou&s;e, from whence he fell and broke his neck. The favourite cat went mad, and was obliged to be killed. In &s;hort, by a &s;eries of cala|mities, all her <HI>dear darlings</HI> were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively de|&s;troyed. She &s;upplied their places with new fa+vourites,
<PB N="210" REF="027817_0209_0FD64F9D4A7A4FE0">
who gave her a great deal of fatigue and trouble.</P>
<P>In the mean while her children grew up, and hav|ing experienced no tenderne&s;s from her, they &s;carce|ly knew they had a mamma; nor did tho&s;e who had the care of their education inculcate that <HI>her</HI> want of affection <HI>did not cancel their duty,</HI> they there|fore treated her with the utmo&s;t neglect, and &s;he had no friend left. In her old age, when &s;he was no longer capable of amu&s;ing her&s;elf with dogs, cats, parrots, and monkies, &s;he became &s;en&s;ible of her errors, and wi&s;hed for the comforts which other parents enjoyed, but it was now too late, and &s;he ended her days with &s;orrow and regret.</P>
<P>This unfortunate Lady had tenderne&s;s enough in her di&s;po&s;ition for all the purpo&s;es of humanity; and had &s;he placed it on proper objects, agreeably to Mrs. Ben&s;on's rule, might have been, like her, a good wife, mother, friend, and mi&s;tre&s;s, con&s;equent|ly, re&s;pectable and happy. But when a child, Mrs. Addis was (under an idea of making her <HI>tender hearted</HI>) permitted to lavi&s;h <HI>immoderate fondne&s;s</HI> on animals, the care of which engro&s;&s;ed her whole at|tention, and greatly interrupted her education; &s;o that, in&s;tead of &s;tudying natural hi&s;tory, or other u&s;eful things, her time was taken up with pamper|ing and attending upon animals, which &s;he con&s;ider|ed as the mo&s;t important bu&s;ine&s;s in life.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="027817_0210_0FD6259959134408">Her children fell into faults of a different nature. Mi&s;s Addis being, as I ob&s;erved in a former part of this hi&s;tory, left to the care of &s;ervants, grew up with very contracted notions. Among&s;t other pre|judices, &s;he imbibed that of being afraid of &s;piders, frogs, and other harmle&s;s things; and having been bit by the monkey when it e&s;caped, as I before re|lated, and terrified by the cat, when it went mad, &s;he extended her fears to every kind of creature, and could not take a walk in the fields, or even in the &s;treet, without a thou&s;and apprehen&s;ions. At la&s;t, her con&s;titution, which from bad nur&s;ing was very delicate, was &s;till more weakened by her con|tinual apprehen&s;ions; and a rat happening to run acro&s;s the path, as &s;he was walking&punc; &s;he fell into &s;its, which afflicted her, at intervals, during the remain|der of her life.</P>
<P>Ma&s;ter Addis, as &s;oon as he became &s;en&s;ible of his mother's foible, conceived an inveterate hatred to animals in general, whom he regarded as his enemies; and thought he was avenging his own cau&s;e when he treated any with barbarity. Cats and dogs, in particular, he &s;ingled out as the objects of his revenge, becau&s;e he con&s;idered them as his mother's greate&s;t favourites: and many a one fell an innocent victim to his mi&s;taken ideas.</P>
<P>The parent Redbrea&s;ts vi&s;ited their kind bene|factors the next winter; but as they were flying a|long
<PB N="212" REF="027817_0211_0FD64FA0A2B21098">
one day, they &s;aw &s;ome crumbs of bread, which had been &s;cattered by Mi&s;s Lucy Jenkins, who, (as I ob&s;erved before) had adopted the &s;enti|ments of her friend, in re&s;pect to compa&s;&s;ion for animals, and re&s;olved to imitate her in every excel|lence. The Redbrea&s;ts gratefully picked up the crumbs, and, encouraged by the gentle invitation of her looks, re&s;olved to repeat their vi&s;its; which they accordingly did, and found &s;uch an ample &s;up|ply, that they thought it more advi&s;eable to go to her with their next brood, than to be burthen&s;ome to their old benefactors, who had a great number of pen&s;ioners to &s;upport: but Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;s Ben|&s;on had frequently the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them, and knew them from all their &s;pecies by &s;everal parti|cularities, which &s;o long an acquaintance had given them the opportunity of ob&s;erving.</P>
<P>Robin, in pur&s;uance of his father's advice, and agreeably to his own inclinations, attached him&s;elf to Mr. Ben&s;on's family, where he was an exceeding great favourite. He had before, under the conduct of his parents, made frequent excur&s;ions into the garden, and was, by their direction&punc; enabled to get up into trees, but his wing never recovered &s;uffici|ently to enable him to make long flights: however, he found him&s;elf at liberty to do as he plea&s;ed, and therefore, during the &s;ummer months commonly pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of his time abroad, and roo&s;ted in trees,

but vi&s;ited the tea-table every morning; and there he u&s;ually met his &s;i&s;ter Peck&s;y, who took up her abode in the orchard, where &s;he enjoyed the friend|&s;hip of her father and mother. Dicky and Flap&s;y, who thought their company too grave, flew giddily about together. In a &s;hort time they were both caught in a trap-cage, and put into the aviary, which Dicky once longed to inhabit. Here they were at fir&s;t very mi&s;erable; but after a while, recollecting their good parent's advice, and the example of the Linnets and Phea&s;ants, they at length reconciled them&s;elves to their lot, and each met with a mate with whom they lived to|lerably happy.</P>
<P>From the foregoing examples, I hope my young readers will &s;elect the be&s;t for their own imitation, and take warning by the re&s;t, otherwi&s;e my hi&s;to|ries are written in vain.</P>
<P>Happy would it be for the animal creation, if every human being, like good Mrs. Ben&s;on, con|&s;ulted the welfare of inferior creatures, and neither &s;poiled them by indulgence, or injured them by tyranny! Happy would mankind be, if every one,

like her, acted in conformity to the will of their Maker; by cultivating in their own minds, and tho&s;e of their children, the <HI>divine principle</HI> of UNI|VERSAL BENEVOLENCE!</P>
