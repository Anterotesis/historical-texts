<P>EVERY effort to &s;upport and &s;trengthen the Chri&s;tian cau&s;e, to inculcate the amiable principles of virtue and morality, to di&s;&s;emi|nate the glad tidings of &s;alvation through a glorious Mediator, to impre&s;s upon the de|generate and carele&s;s &s;inner, &s;en&s;ations of the va&s;t and inconceivably important realities of a judgment to come, and a never-ending eternity of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery.&mdash;Such at|tempts de&s;erve the encouragement and pat|ronage of all good members of &s;ociety, all tho&s;e who are anxious to pre&s;erve the tran|quility and well-being of their country. For righteou&s;ne&s;s will prove an impenetrable bar|rier in &s;ecuring the permanency of a govern|ment; whil&s;t every &s;pecies of vice mu&s;t tend to enervate, debilitate, and finally &s;ap the foundation of the wi&s;e&s;t con&s;titution. For the Almighty will be a canopy and &s;afeguard to his faithful &s;ervants.</P>

UPON the candour of my readers, and my own con&s;cious rectitude, I mu&s;t depend for the reception of this Publication: at lea&s;t I &s;hall enjoy the inward &s;atisfaction of con|tributing mercy mite, to rou&s;e mankind from their &s;tupor, and promote the cau&s;e of Chri&s;|tianity. And I can a&s;&s;ure my readers that I am not in&s;tigated to this undertaking, by &s;elfi&s;h motives; but am directed for the good of &s;ouls, and the glory of God. Should it in any degree an&s;wer the much de&s;ired pur|po&s;e, I &s;hall be amply compen&s;ated for my labors.</P>
<P>GRANT, O thou inexhau&s;tible Fountain of all good, thy enlightning, enfluencing, all-prevailing grace, to make my pen like that of a ready writer; in awakening, con|vincing and converting tho&s;e, who have never participated of the ineffable riches of divine grace and pardoning love, which flow ince&s;|&s;antly from the right hand of the immacu|late Je&s;us! O that I may experience that &s;weet complacence and &s;erenity&mdash;that clear|ne&s;s of perception&mdash;and that divine illumi|nation, from the immutable Source of per|fection, which are nece&s;&s;ary for all tho&s;e who engage in thy &s;ervice! Suffer no fa&s;cinating allurements of worldly objects to draw me a&s;ide, or the &s;educing wiles of the devil to pervert my pen from the &s;implicity and puri|ty of the unerring Word of Truth. O thou who&s;e wi&s;dom never degenerates into craft, ju&s;tice into &s;everity, or mercy into weakne&s;s!
<PB N="5" REF="025427_0004_0FCCE3D041A1F030">
direct my mind in this undertaking! With|out thy ble&s;&s;ing I can do nothing; every effort will be as the &s;ounding bra&s;s or tink|ling cymbal: but under the au&s;pecious influ|ence of thy &s;pirit, I tru&s;t thy kingdom may be advanced&mdash;thy church militant more and more e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that many precious &s;ouls may ta&s;te the pure, un&s;ullied joys, that flow from thee! Grant this, for thy dear Son's &s;ake.</P>
<P>I MUST beg leave to premi&s;e, that I &s;hall &s;edulou&s;ly wave all di&s;putation on the con|troverted points of Chri&s;tianity. It is far from my intentions to engage as a champion in the vindication of any jarring opinions of &s;chola&s;tic divinity; which perhaps is not worth the contention, or not at all nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation. Neither intrude upon the "&s;ep|tical &s;ubtilties" of Dei&s;ts: nor &s;hall I perplex my&s;elf or readers, with the deep re&s;earches of metaphy&s;ical di&s;qui&s;ition. I &s;hall &s;ubmit &s;uch lucubrations to tho&s;e who are more pen|etrating, or con&s;ider them of more con&s;e|quence than my&s;elf: for I have long enter|tained the opinion, that controver&s;ies have a very pernicious effect; and are generally cre|ative of animo&s;ity, envy, hatred, and the very pa&s;&s;ions that are the mo&s;t unlike tho&s;e inculcated, by the meek and lowly Je&s;us. Scripture expre&s;sly commandeth to avoid all vain contentions. How is it po&s;&s;ible for Chri&s;tians, to reconcile that implacable &s;pirit of bitterne&s;s and acrimony, with which con|trover&s;ies
<PB N="6" REF="025427_0005_0FCCE3D11369A678">
are maintained? So high is the re&s;entment of the opponents &s;ometimes rai&s;|ed, that they catch with avidity at any clue, however weak or oppo&s;ite to truth, to extend the controver&s;y, interlarded with &s;currility and abu&s;e. And di&s;putants are generally predetermined not to acquie&s;ce in the opini|on advanced again&s;t their own, however &s;anctioned by truth, or guided by rea&s;on.&mdash;Di&s;putes &s;ow the &s;eeds of hatred and malev|olence, and finally terminate in open rup|ture! And it is a lamentable fact, that good men &s;ometimes greatly err in this. Is it not devoutly to be wi&s;hed, that all jarring opini|ons and di&s;&s;entions could forever cea&s;e? And is it not fervently to be de&s;ired, that the fol|lowers of Je&s;us of every denomination, &s;hould join together in an amicable league of har|monious love? Is not every Chri&s;tian con|&s;trained to exclaim, "Accelerate O God, that glorious period, when peace, uninter|rupted, triumphant peace! &s;hall reign on earth! when the kingdom of this world, &s;hall become the kingdom of God and his Chri&s;t! and anti-chri&s;t no more be &s;uffered to diffu&s;e his baneful &s;eed." Are not all Chri&s;tians de&s;irous of attaining the &s;ame haven? Do not their de&s;ires in&s;eparably centre there? Why then &s;hould one &s;ay, "I am of Paul," another, "I am of Apol|los," &s;ince Je&s;us Chri&s;t is all in all, and through his name alone can we be &s;aved. Do we invariably ob&s;erve his affectionate

mandate, "Love one another?" Can we do this and at the &s;ame time fo&s;ter the worm|wood of gall and bitterne&s;s in our bo&s;oms?</P>
<P>THERE was never perhaps a more gloomy &s;ea&s;on, never a period more pregnant with calamities, and "big with death," in the city of Philadelphia, than the pre&s;ent. Her &s;treets are become de&s;olate, and the goodly pro&s;pect, is quite rever&s;ed! Was there ever a time that called with a more audible voice, for a &s;ud|den, &s;incere and unre&s;erved reformation? The wrath of the Almighty &s;eems inflamed again&s;t this City&mdash;his wrath impregnated with death!&mdash;His fiery indignation &s;catters terror around!&mdash;The light of his countenance is hidden from us&mdash;his long &s;uffering patience is at length exhau&s;ted&mdash;his mercies &s;lighted&mdash;his go&s;pel de&s;pi&s;ed! At length the &s;word of his indignation, the &s;harp two edged &s;word of wrath is un&s;heathed. And his vindictive ju&s;tice mu&s;t be &s;atisfied. His thunders arm|ed with triple horror and vengeful fire, &s;leep no more; but hang impending over our guil|ty heads, replete with mortality. "Yet the reed, the brittle reed, ju&s;t &s;inking, may re|commend us to the Rock of ages!"</P>
<P>I KNOW there are many who attribute this awful Contagion to natural cau&s;es, and ridicule the idea of a &s;upernatural agent: but I conceive, we may clearly trace the finger of God in our cha&s;ti&s;ement. Although his ways are a great deep to mortals, and &s;ome|times dark and in&s;crutable to finite intelli|gences;
<PB N="8" REF="025427_0007_0FCCE4215B76A3C0">
yet here his wonder-working wi&s;|dom is manife&s;t, and tho&s;e who are di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate, and not wholly blinded by the god of this world, may behold omnipotent ven|geance carried on.&mdash;Let any one of my read|ers lay his hand upon his heart, and a&s;k his con&s;cience if he has not contributed his &s;hare in provoking the wrath of almighty God: if after an impartial examination he receives an acquital; I &s;alute him as a thrice happy &s;oul! and pronounce, that he need not trem|ble at the approach of any pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e, however deadly, nor death it&s;elf with all its frightful apparatus!</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent afflicting &s;ea&s;on mo&s;t &s;trik|ingly depicts, the amazing folly, and fatal delu&s;ion of tho&s;e who&s;e affections are inor|dinately attached to the fluctuating, un&s;table enjoyments of a vain world. The&s;e &s;olemn &s;eens of mortality will lead us to reflect, that there is no permanency in any worldly plea&s;|ure. How &s;oon, alas! do all the guilded baubles vani&s;h, (in which we have placed &s;uch durable gratification) and leave nothing to &s;atisfy the fami&s;hing &s;oul! The earth and all the fulne&s;s thereof, with all the blandi&s;h|ments of time and &s;en&s;e, can never be a &s;uf|ficient value to attach the rational, immortal mind! This tran&s;itory &s;tate can never bound its attainments, it ardently pants for the ce|le&s;tial joys of a kingdom <HI>who&s;e builder and maker is God.</HI></P>

DEATH, is truly an all-eloquent preacher, it convinces powerfully, when all arguments have been wielded to no purpo&s;e&mdash;it points and &s;ays, "Be ye al&s;o ready!"&mdash;for in &s;uch an hour as ye know not, the fatal arrow will receive its irre&s;i&s;tible mandate! Nay often attacks tho&s;e who are hugging them&s;elves, &s;aying, "I will enjoy the fruits of my labor and lay up wealth for future grandeur&mdash;&s;oul, &s;oul, take thy re&s;t." Fatal &s;ecurity! fool!&mdash;to imagine thy&s;elf &s;afe, when death is even now approaching towards thee with rapid &s;trides, like a "&s;taunch murderer, &s;teady to his purpo&s;e:" and perhaps in a few hours all thy braggart hopes will be included in a mouldering coffin of inanimate clay:

<P>THE expre&s;s declaration of in&s;piration mu&s;t convince every believer, that judgments are often inflicted upon rebellious and gain|&s;aying generations, as a cha&s;ti&s;ement for their departure from him. If we turn to the &s;a|cred volume, we &s;hall find this invariably the ca&s;e, in God's dealings with the old world, whenever they apo&s;tatized, the &s;courges of his rod pur&s;ued them.&mdash;I do not expect to convince tho&s;e who &s;acrilegiou&s;ly deny the divine origin of the Scripture, of this &s;acred truth: the power of omnipotence alone, will &s;trike conviction into ob&s;tinate unbelieving &s;ouls; yet God is not a man that he &s;hould change, he is the &s;ame immutably, perfect being, that he then was, and we are equally the objects of his care. Sin cau&s;ed the utter di&s;truction of the ante-deluvians. Their prime|val rectitude was transformed, and they were immer&s;ed in every &s;pecies of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, pride and corruption. The Almighty beheld it afar off, and &s;ent his avenging mini&s;ters of wrath to de&s;troy them. <HI>And God &s;aw that the wickedne&s;s of man was great in the earth, and that every immagination of the heart was evil continually.

Again, the Almighty wounds but to heal more effectually, more &s;avingly; and when you &s;eem &s;hrouded in a cloud of im|penetrable darkne&s;s, and encompa&s;&s;ed about with many &s;orrows, when all nature wears a lowring a&s;pect, and the light of his coun|tenance &s;eems hid from you; he is then work|ing greater things for you than you can con|ceive: in &s;hort, he is preparing a crown of immortal glory for you. He is not more merciful in his favous than his puni&s;hments. Since it is evident that pro&s;perity renders us fargetful of our benefactor; and adver&s;ity, by pointing out the in&s;tability of all created enjoyments: forces us to &s;eek for more per|manent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the embraces of the great Bridegroom.

<P>THE late lamented and revered Licius and his amiable con&s;ort, long dived in connubial felicity, far tran&s;cending the lot commonly a&s;&s;igned to humanity. The &s;oul of Licius was harmony&mdash;with the mo&s;t amiable and tender &s;en&s;ibility, and formed highly &s;u&s;cept|ible of tender and ennobling emotions. He was remarked, and e&s;timated for his probity, undi&s;tingui&s;hed hone&s;ty, and undi&s;&s;embled &s;in|cerity. Taught by his divine Ma&s;ter, he looked upon the great family of mankind with love, and exerci&s;ed his talents in com|forting, and aiding the indigent and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. His chief happine&s;s however con&s;i&s;ted in do|me&s;tic, innocent amu&s;ements. He loved his wi&s;e with the mo&s;t ardent, though temperate pa&s;&s;ion; that is, his regards were not tumul|tuous and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounding profe&s;&s;ions, but reduced to a calm and unruffled &s;un&s;hine. She an|&s;wered his affection, and nothing appeared wanting for the completion of their happi|ne&s;s on earth. Yet alas! vain, un&s;table, mu|table &s;tate of tran&s;itory things! how &s;hort, and how uncertain are all created enjoyments! His avocations called him to a di&s;tant part of the continent; and he left his family after recommending them to the protection of their heavenly Father. Immediately after his de|parture, the pe&s;tilential contagion made its appearance in the city. Licius received ac|counts of the deadly malady; he prayed fer|vently
<PB N="34" REF="025427_0033_0FCCE50497FB0DA8">
for the pre&s;ervation of his partner and little ones; and left them in the hands of him who formed their mortal bodies. He how|ever, accelerates his return, and with a mix|ture of hope and fear; as he advanced to|wards his habitation, he heard the &s;ound of mourning and lamentation. And upon en|tering the door, was met by a coffin and mourners&mdash;His daughter was no more&mdash;the prevailing contagion had cut her off, in the bloom of youth! He &s;upported this sight with the fortitude that becomes a Chri&s;tian; and hurried to &s;ee if his &s;till dearer Naomi was &s;afe&mdash;he ha&s;tened to her apartment; when, O heart-rending idea, the dear part|ner of his life was laid upon her bed, pale and breathle&s;s&mdash;a lump of inanimate clay! Such a trial was for a moment too much for his gentle nature&mdash;his fortitude for&s;ook him&mdash;his knees trembled beneath him&mdash;a death|like palene&s;s over&s;pread his countenance, and he fell almo&s;t deprived of all &s;en&s;ation upon the floor&mdash;On recovering, the tears invol|untarily &s;treamed from his eyes, and his heart was rent with di&s;tre&s;&s;ing convul&s;ions&mdash;he cried out, &s;he is gone!&mdash;the dear &s;oother of my &s;orrows is gone!&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;more to return. Why, O why was life &s;o plea&s;ant, &s;o delectable to me&mdash;it plunges me &s;till deeper into exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery! Yet what &s;hall I &s;ay? forgive, O Father in heaven, forgive the repinings of thy poor afflicted &s;ervant&mdash;I will no more murmur, no more

<P>I AM fearful that tho&s;e who were ab&s;ent in the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ea&s;on of our calamities; and did not ob&s;erve the afflictions of mortality, will not be &s;uitably impre&s;&s;ed with the awful and mournful de&s;olation; nor lay to heart, that judgments are &s;ent to rou&s;e the &s;leepy and &s;ecure. Let me intreat you Sirs, not to &s;light the admonition of a kind and gra|cious God. Return not to rioting, revelling, and mi&s;pending that time which ought to be ine&s;timably precious in your eyes, by employ|ing it in &s;ecuring your be&s;t intere&s;t, your glo|ry and immortality! The precious light of his glorious countenance is now again beam|ing upon us&mdash;The clouds are fa&s;t &s;cattering, and health may &s;oon again ble&s;s this city. But oh! avert a &s;econd judgment, which may prove more grievous than the fir&s;t. Live like pil|grims and &s;trangers on earth&mdash;turn from the allurements of vice, and fly for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Rock of ages. Follow not the dulcet voice of the de&s;tructive Siren, which &s;ound|eth to allure, and allures but to de&s;troy. Give no ground to the enemy of your &s;ouls; but tru&s;t in humble re&s;ignation upon him, who gives grace for grace. Sould you neglect &s;o
