<HEAD>THE <HI>Salvation of the Soul,</HI> Con&s;idered in a brief ESSAY, prepa|red for the hands that are at work on the De&s;igns of the <HI>Common Salvation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MAy our <HI>Go&s;pellized People,</HI> now give Atten|tion, a ju&s;t &amp; &s;trong Attention, to the mo&s;t Important Matters, that ever any People had, or can have, Set before them. The Mo&s;t-concerning, the All-concerning, Matters are Set before us, in tho&s;e Words,
<Q><BIBL>I. Pet. I. 9.</BIBL>
<HI>The</HI> END <HI>of your</HI> FAITH, <HI>the</HI> SALVATION <HI>of your</HI> SOULS.</Q></P>
<P>EVERY Word is Ponderous; it weighs like the <HI>Mountains</HI> of GOD. The <HI>In&s;piration of the Almighty,</HI> em|ploys the Pen of an Apo&s;tle from Him, to Recommend unto us, a <HI>Faith</HI> in a Lovely JESUS; the <HI>Faith</HI> of what He will do for His Followers, at that <HI>Second Coming</HI> of His, which is to be looked for. In the Pro&s;e|cution of this Intention, We are here treated with Two Things; Fir&s;t, An Incomparable <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s,</HI> for the obtaining of which every Man has cau&s;e to be un&s;peakably Sollicitous;
<PB N="2" REF="002144_0003_0FBC2225DFC456E8">
An Ine&s;timable <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s,</HI> which if thou <HI>Lo&s;e,</HI> O Man, <HI>What will it profit thee, if thou gain the whole World?</HI> This <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s,</HI> is, <HI>The Salvation of the Soul</HI> But then, Secondly; The <HI>Way</HI> wherein we are made Partakers of this <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s.</HI> T'wil be the <HI>End</HI> of our <HI>Faith</HI>; Our <HI>Way</HI> to it, is by a Genuine <HI>Faith</HI> in the JESUS, who alone can <HI>Lead us into the Re&s;t which remains for the people of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>That which I am in the mo&s;t awakening Terms, to oblige your mo&s;t Serious Thoughts upon, is This <HI>Faithful &s;aying of GOD</HI>; Oh! Let it be counted <HI>worthy of all Acceptation</HI> with you!</P>
<P>The <HI>SALVATION</HI> of the <HI>SOUL,</HI> will be the <HI>END</HI> of a True <HI>FAITH</HI> in Our Glorious and Mighty, and Only <HI>SAVIOUR.</HI></P>
<P>Sea&s;onably &amp; Effectually to make &s;ure of a part in the <HI>Salvation,</HI> whereof the Ble&s;&s;ed JE|SUS is <HI>the Author, to as many as obey Him</HI>; This, This is the Thing, which you are now with an Uncommon Importunity to be pre&s;s'd un|to. For, my Friends, Our SAVIOUR has in|&s;tructed us, Tis not every one that &s;hall be <HI>Saved</HI>: No, Tis not every one that pretends to own Him for a <HI>Lord,</HI> and makes a fair pre|ten&s;ion to <HI>Religion,</HI> that &s;hall be <HI>Saved. Mul|titudes, Multitudes,</HI> are they who peri&s;h, by a mo&s;t Sotti&s;h <HI>Neglect</HI> of their GRAND IN|TEREST; And you have cau&s;e to Think up|on a <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> which GOD now puts unto <HI>You,</HI> but which indeed all the Angels in Heaven
<PB N="3" REF="002144_0004_0FBC22281D4E55A8">
can give no An&s;wer to; That very Solemn <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> Heb. II. 3. <HI>How &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we Neglect &s;o great Salvation</HI>!</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing that is now to be done, is to a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Existence</HI> of the <HI>Subject,</HI> the <HI>Welfare</HI> whereof we are now Entreating you to be wi&s;e|ly concerned about; And this is, The SOUL. This A&s;&s;ertion is to be introduced, as an Un|doubted Preliminary, to what we are going upon; Job XXXII. 8 <HI>There is a SPIRIT in Man.</HI> A SPIRIT capable of Di&s;cerning and Arguing and Affecting: A SPIRIT which Rea&s;ons, and Compares, and Judges, and Chu|&s;es; A SPIRIT which a Man of Rea&s;on, when he feels him&s;elf a <HI>dying,</HI> does commit into the Hands of a <HI>Faithful Creator.</HI> O Man, Thou ha&s;t a SOUL, the <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI> whereof ought to be how <HI>Real,</HI> and how <HI>Awful,</HI> to thee! Indeed, it might &s;eem a Needle&s;s <HI>Labour,</HI> yea, and a Cutting <HI>Satyr,</HI> to take any Pains for the con|vincing of a Man, that he has a <HI>Soul</HI> within him. Should any Man <HI>Doubt</HI> whether he has a SOUL within him, his very <HI>Doubt</HI> would be an <HI>Evi|dence</HI> of it. So wondrou&s;ly would that Man <HI>Confute</HI> him&s;elf, who &s;hould thus go to degrade him&s;elf into the cla&s;s of the <HI>Bea&s;ts that Peri&s;h.</HI> It was the Ridiculous Mi&s;take of the poor <HI>A|mericans,</HI> who when they fir&s;t &s;aw &s;ome <HI>Euro|peans</HI> on Hor&s;e back, took the Hor&s;e and his Rider to be but One Animal. But much more worthy to be Ridiculed, arc the <HI>Epicure|ans</HI> who take not the <HI>Body</HI> and the <HI>Soul,</HI> for very Different Sub&s;tances. My Friend, Thy <HI>Body</HI> is but a <HI>Cabinet</HI> unto a <HI>Jewel,</HI> the mo&s;t precious
<PB N="4" REF="002144_0005_0FBC222BADB6F8F0">
in the World; A SOUL, A SOUL which has many Inconte&s;tible Demon&s;trations (be|&s;ides tho&s;e of well-atte&s;ted <HI>Apparitions,</HI>) of its <HI>Immortality.</HI> A SOUL which is capable of <HI>Doing</HI> more for GOD, and of <HI>Tasting</HI> more from Him, than all the Creatures in the whole Vi&s;ible Creation. A SOUL, whereof a SA|VIOUR who has <HI>been Powerfully declared, The SON of GOD</HI>; and the <HI>True Witne&s;s, who de|livereth Souls</HI>; has declared unto us, Matth. X. 28. <HI>It cannot be killed, by that which Kills the Body.</HI> A Text, which the <HI>Men of corrupt minds,</HI> who are for that Scandalous Epitaph on a Dead Man, <HI>Here lies the whole of the Man,</HI> in vain Study to make Eva&s;ions from. That SOUL of thine, O Man, When will thine Ears be open unto the Cries which it makes unto thee? Verily, There is the <HI>Voice of GOD</HI> crying to Every Man, in the cry which his own SOUL makes unto him. <Q>When, O Man, wilt thou <HI>&s;hew thy &s;elf a Man?</HI> Thy Dying <HI>Body</HI> is abundantly cared for. When &s;hall the SOUL, that is to Survive the <HI>Body,</HI> have a due care be&s;tow'd upon it? Thy <HI>Body</HI> is <HI>fed</HI>; But thy SOUL is fami&s;h'd. Thy <HI>Body</HI> is <HI>cloath'd</HI>; But thy SOUL is naked. The Di&s;tempers of thy <HI>Body,</HI> thou &s;eeke&s;t a cure for. Thy SOUL is <HI>pining away in its Iniquities.</HI> Thy <HI>Body</HI> is falling and ha&s;t'ning down into the <HI>Pit of Corruption.</HI> Oh! what Provi&s;ion ha&s;t thou made, that thy SOUL may be then <HI>Re|ceived into Everla&s;ting Habitations?</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Subject</HI> is then agreed upon; The next
<PB N="5" REF="002144_0006_0FBC222CCCD51C48">
thing to be done, is to prevail with you, that you would pur&s;ue the <HI>Welfare</HI> of this Noble <HI>Subject</HI>; A point which, One would think, &s;hould now need no further to be &s;poken to. Do but Remember, O Man, That thou ha&s;t a SOUL, and thou can&s;t not but Acknowledge, that it mu&s;t be, <HI>The ONE THING that is Needful,</HI> to Con&s;ult the Welfare of it. But that this De&s;ign may be well pur&s;ued, we will Maintain Two Po&s;itions.</P>
<P>My Fir&s;t POSITION is; The SALVATI|ON of the SOUL, is to be the <HI>Grand Point of Sollicitude,</HI> with all that <HI>are going down to the Dust,</HI> whereof <HI>none can keep alive his own Soul.</HI> But now, What is implied, what is contain'd, in, <HI>The Salvation of the Soul?</HI> SALVATION! O comprehen&s;ive Word! O Incomprehen&s;i|ble Good! SOUL, 'Tis beyond <HI>all that thou can&s;t Ask or Think</HI>!</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; In the <HI>Salvation of the Soul,</HI> there is a <HI>Deliverance</HI> from all the Mi&s;eries to which by our Fall from GOD, we are become Obnoxi|ous; all the Mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e whom <HI>GOD counteth for His Enemies.</HI> The doleful Outcry of all Mankind, may be That, Lam. V.16. <HI>The crown is fallen from our Head, and wo is unto us, in that we have Sinned.</HI> Soul, T'wil be thy Outcry, whenever the <HI>Sleep of Death</HI> upon thee, is going off. The <HI>Apo&s;ta&s;y</HI> from GOD, begun by our <HI>Fir&s;t Parents,</HI> has plunged us all into a <HI>woful</HI> Condition. The <HI>Soul,</HI> involved in the <HI>Sin</HI> of our <HI>Fir&s;t Parents.</HI> and having by <HI>Actual Sin</HI> al&s;o <HI>Denied the GOD that is Above,</HI> may make its Bitter Lamentati|ons.
<PB N="6" REF="002144_0007_0FBC222E1D930F68">
<Q><HI>O wretched One that I am</HI>! I have the <HI>Wrath of GOD abiding of me</HI>&punc; and His dire|ful <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> is di&s;pen&s;ed unto me, even in my <HI>Pro&s;perity,</HI> as well as my <HI>adver&s;ity.</HI> I am <HI>Sick</HI> of <HI>Greivous Di&s;ea&s;es.</HI> I am a <HI>Slave</HI> to <HI>Satan,</HI> and I <HI>&s;erve diver&s;e Lu&s;ts.</HI> When I am <HI>driven</HI> out of this <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> I am like to fall into the Hands which it is a <HI>fearful thing to fall into.</HI> There is danger that my Re|turn unto it at a tremendous <HI>Day of Judg|ment,</HI> will be only to undergo a <HI>Strange Puni&s;hment re&s;erved for the workers of Iniquity.</HI> And Oh! What will become of me, when This Earth &s;hall become like a <HI>Fiery Oven,</HI> and as a mighty, flaming, blazing <HI>Furnace,</HI> which all the <HI>Wicked of the Earth</HI> &s;hall be thrown into!</Q> O <HI>Soul</HI> in wondrous Perils, To be Re&s;cued from all this Confu&s;ion, is that <HI>Salvation,</HI> which is now &s;et before thee, in the <HI>Word of Truth,</HI> which is the <HI>Go&s;pel of thy Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>But then, Secondly; There is in the <HI>Salva|tion of the Soul,</HI> a <HI>Po&s;itive</HI> Good, conveyed; All the <HI>Good</HI> which is promi&s;ed unto the <HI>Fear of GOD</HI>: and Oh! <HI>How Great is ihat Good,</HI> which GOD has laid up for them that <HI>Fear Him</HI>! The <HI>Salvation</HI> which we have in our <HI>View,</HI> is in the Sacred Oracles which de&s;cribe it unto us, called, <HI>Life Eternal.</HI> The Thing of which we are often and often informed in the <HI>Holy Book,</HI> which none but an <HI>Holy GOD,</HI> and <HI>One who cannot Lye,</HI> can be the Author of, is That; 1 Joh. II. 25. <HI>This is the promi&s;e that He has promi&s;ed us, Eternal Life.</HI> Herein, fir&s;t,
<PB N="7" REF="002144_0008_0FBC22313133CF58">
there is a <HI>Sentence of Life</HI> pa&s;&s;ed upon us, and our <HI>Sin</HI> is <HI>Pardoned.</HI> In our <HI>Pardon,</HI> GOD re&s;tores us to His <HI>Favour,</HI> and <HI>in His Favour there is Life.</HI> There is a <HI>Justification of Life,</HI> wherein a Gracious GOD &s;ays unto us, <HI>The Lord hath put away thy sin; Thou &s;hall not Dye:</HI> Says unto us, <HI>Be comforted, Thy Sins are for|given thee.</HI> Herein there is that thing done for us; Rom. V. 19. <HI>We receive the Gift of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and reign in Life by JESUS CHRIST.</HI> In the <HI>Salvation of the soul,</HI> there is a Relea&s;e given to the Soul, from the Bonds to &s;uffer the <HI>De&s;truction from GOD,</HI> which His <HI>Violated Law</HI> lays upon the Sinner; and the Soul may Sing, <HI>Lord, I will prai&s;e thee; for that tho' thou wa&s;t Angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou do&s;t comfort me.</HI></P>
<P>But then, Secondly; There is an <HI>Entrance into Life</HI>; which is made by our coming to <HI>Live unto GOD.</HI> We are <HI>Quickned</HI> with In|fluences from Above, which Enliven us, and Enable us to pay tho&s;e Regards unto the <HI>Li|ving GOD,</HI> which we have heretofore paid unto our <HI>Idols.</HI> We have that <HI>Life of GOD</HI> begun in us, wherein the <HI>Prai&s;ing</HI> and <HI>Plea|&s;ing</HI> of GOD, becomes the <HI>Main Scope</HI> of our <HI>Life; Self</HI> is dethroned, and GOD re&s;umes His <HI>Throne</HI> in our Souls. We terminate our <HI>Loves</HI> and <HI>Hopes</HI> and <HI>Joyes,</HI> no longer in <HI>Creatures,</HI> but pa&s;s from them and through them unto GOD: We <HI>Dy</HI> to <HI>Creatures,</HI> and <HI>Live</HI> unto GOD. And it is with us accor|ding to That; Rom. VIII. 2. <HI>The Law of the
<PB N="8" REF="002144_0009_0FBC2232E718D1D0">
Spirit of Life in CHRIST JESUS hath made me free from the Law of Sin and of Death.</HI> The <HI>Salvation of the Soul</HI> does Relieve and Remove the Maladies which the SOUL is deprav'd withal, and fill the <HI>Soul</HI> with the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD, and of the <HI>Neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>And now,</P>
<P>Thirdly; The <HI>Life Eternal,</HI> which had its <HI>Inchoation</HI> in This World, has its <HI>Con&s;umma|tion</HI> in another and a better World, after our <HI>Departure</HI> out of This. And here fir&s;t, There &s;hall be that Word accompli&s;hed, Rom. VIII. 10. <HI>If CHRIST be in you, the Body is dead, be|cau&s;e of Sin, but the Spirit is Life, becau&s;e of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Our <HI>Spirits</HI> will, at our Expira|tion, <HI>fly away,</HI> into a <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> where they <HI>Live unto GOD</HI> and are <HI>Comforted.</HI> But then, anon &s;hall be that Word accompli&s;hed, 1 Cor. XV 53. <HI>This corruptible mu&s;t put on incorruption; This mortal mu&s;t put on immortality.</HI> The <HI>Sal|vation of the Soul,</HI> will prove the <HI>Salvation of the Body</HI> too. 'Tis ob&s;ervable, That the <HI>Salva|tion of the Soul,</HI> is to be received at the <HI>Appear|ing</HI> of the Lord; even when He &s;hall come to <HI>Rai&s;e</HI> the <HI>Dead</HI> and <HI>Judge</HI> the World. The <HI>Soul</HI> will not be in all circum&s;tances as it would be, till that Great Revolution. We &s;hall then have our <HI>Bodies</HI> fetch'd back from the dark Cham|bers of <HI>Death,</HI> and given back to our <HI>Spirits,</HI> fill'd with an <HI>Ethereal matter,</HI> and made <HI>Lumi|nous</HI> and <HI>Vigorous,</HI> and <HI>Salted,</HI> or made <HI>Incor|ruptible</HI> with the <HI>Fiery Robe,</HI> whereof we were &s;tripped by the <HI>First Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI> Our <HI>Life</HI> being <HI>Redeemed from De&s;truction,</HI> at the <HI>Re&s;ur|rection

of the Dead,</HI> our <HI>Youth</HI> will be <HI>Renewed,</HI> and we &s;hall have <HI>Bodies,</HI> wherein we &s;hall <HI>mount up as with the Wings of Eagles.</HI> Then we &s;hall be &s;heltered under the Wings of the JE|SUS, who <HI>Delivers from the Wrath to come</HI>; find with Him a &s;helter from the <HI>Devouring Fire,</HI> and the <HI>Everlasting Burnings,</HI> which they that <HI>Know not GOD, and Obey not His Go&s;pel,</HI> &s;hall be doom'd unto. Then, Then we &s;hall be taken into the <HI>Holy City,</HI> which has the <HI>Glory of GOD</HI> giving <HI>Light</HI> unto it. There we &s;hall have <HI>all Tears wiped away from our Eyes.</HI> There&punc; we &s;hall be <HI>Filled with all the Fulne&s;s of GOD</HI>&punc; There GOD will become <HI>All in All</HI> unto us. But, O the <HI>Duration</HI> of this <HI>Felicity!</HI> An <HI>Eter|nal Salvation!</HI> After we have been in that <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Immortality,</HI> for Thou|&s;ands of Myriads of Millions of Ages, and &s;uch as it would even tire all humane Under&s;tand|ing to ca&s;t up the Numbers of, we &s;hall be no nearer the Period of it, than the Fir&s;t Moment that we came into it.</P>

There is a JESUS, able and willing to &s;ave thee, out of all the Ruins, which by &s;inning again&s;t GOD thou ha&s;t brought upon thee</HI>! Soul, What a Sweet Invitation has thy SAVIOUR given thee? <HI>Come to me, all you that Labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you Re&s;t</HI>! What a Sweet Invitation; <HI>Ho, every one that thir&s;teth,

come ye to the waters; Come unto me, Hear, and your &s;oul &s;hall live!</HI> To over come thy Un|belief, O Invited Soul, He has kindly Spoken a word worth a World; A Word which has broken Millions of Hearts; And &s;hall <HI>Thine</HI> be Obdurate!

<P>Thirdly. But the <HI>Salvation of the Soul</HI> can|not be had, without <HI>Believing</HI> in the Glori|ous and Mighty, and only SAVIOUR. The Greate&s;t CASE that ever was an&s;wered in the World, hear now what An&s;wer is to be given unto it. The CASE has been pro|pounded, and, Oh! that it were oftener &s;o, and with a <HI>Soul full of Troubles,</HI> &mdash;Even this, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be Saved?</HI> The Reply given to it, by the Apo&s;tles of GOD, is a very Authentick one; Act. XVI. 31. <HI>Believe on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and thou &s;hall be Saved.</HI> FAITH is the <HI>Flight</HI> of a Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul, unto our Ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR. The <HI>End</HI> of this <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Flight</HI> is, <HI>The Sal|vation of the Soul.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>End</HI> which <HI>Faith</HI>

does <HI>Aim</HI> at; and the <HI>End</HI> which <HI>Faith</HI> does <HI>Come</HI> at. Our SAVIOUR has given us This Definition of the <HI>Faith</HI> which &s;eeks and finds the <HI>Salvation of the Soul</HI>; Joh. V. 40. 'Tis a <HI>Coming to Him, that we may have Life.</HI> The proce&s;s of a <HI>Saving Faith</HI> &s;hall be now Set before you.

<P>Fir&s;t. Become &s;en&s;ible of what you are, and how much you want <HI>Salvation,</HI> while you are at a Di&s;tance from your SAVIOUR. To the <HI>Christle&s;s,</HI> mu&s;t be &s;aid, what we have in Rev. III. 17. <HI>Thou art wretched and mi&s;erable and poor and blind and naked.</HI> O Fall into an Heart-melting Meditation; <Q>What am I but a <HI>Child of Wrath,</HI> and a <HI>Prey to the Terrible,</HI> and Full of a loth&s;ome <HI>Lepro&s;y?</HI> Until my SAVIOUR Pitty me?

<P><PB N="15" REF="002144_0016_0FBC223EA4C05340">Secondly Look for no le&s;s than the whole <HI>Salvation of the Soul,</HI> in Looking to your SA|VIOUR.
