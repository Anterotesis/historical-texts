<OPENER><DATELINE>Switzerland, <DATE>September 1794.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER &s;o long a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of our corre&s;|pondence, after a &s;ilence like that of death, and a &s;eparation which for &s;ome time pa&s;t &s;eemed as final as if we had been divided by the limits of <Q>that country from who&s;e bourn no traveller returns,</Q> with what grateful plea&s;ure did I recognize your hand-writing, with what eagerne&s;s did I break the &s;eal of your welcome letter, and with what &s;oothing emotions receive the tidings of your welfare, and the a&s;&s;urance of your affection! Your letter was a tali&s;man that &s;erved to conjure up a thou&s;and ima|ges of &s;orrows and of joys that are pa&s;t, and which were obliterated by the turbulent &s;en&s;ations of di&s;|may and horror.</P>
<P>Perhaps it will not be unintere&s;ting to you to re|ceive from me a &s;ketch of the &s;cenes which have pa&s;&s;ed in Paris &s;ince the &s;econd of June, an epocha to be for ever deplored by the friends of liberty, which &s;eated a vulgar and &s;anguinary de&s;pot on the ruins of a throne, till the memorable 28th of July 1794, when Liberty, bleeding with a thou&s;and wounds, revived once more. If the picture I &s;end you of tho&s;e extraordinary events be not well drawn, it is at lea&s;t marked with the characters of truth, &s;ince I have been the witne&s;s of the &s;cenes I de|&s;cribe,
<PB N="4" REF="031634_0003_0FED6234F6EECE20">
and have known per&s;onally all the principal actors. Tho&s;e &s;cenes, connected in my mind with all the detail of dome&s;tic &s;orrow, with the feelings of private &s;ympathy, with the tears of mourning friend&s;hip, are impre&s;&s;ed upon my memory in cha|racters that are indelible. They ri&s;e in &s;ad &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion like the &s;hades of Banquo's line, and pa&s;s along my &s;huddering recollection.</P>
<P>After having &s;o long &s;uffered without daring to utter a complaint, it will relieve my oppre&s;&s;ed &s;pi|rits, to give you an account of our late &s;ituation; and, in &s;o doing, I &s;hall feel the &s;ame &s;ort of me|lancholy plea&s;ure as the mariner who paints the horrors of the tempe&s;t when he has reached the harbour, and &s;heds a tender tear over his lo&s;t com|panions who have peri&s;hed in the wreck&mdash;Ah! my dear friend, that overwhelming recollection fills my heart with angui&s;h which only they who have &s;uffered can conceive. Tho&s;e per&s;ons in who&s;e &s;ociety I mo&s;t delighted, in who&s;e cultivated minds and enlightened conver&s;ation I found the &s;ole com|pen&s;ation for what I had lo&s;t in leaving my country and my friends&mdash;to &s;ee them torn from me for ever, to know the preci&s;e moment in which they were dragged to execution, to feel&mdash;but let me turn a while from images of horror which I have con&s;ider|ed but too deeply, and which have ca&s;t a &s;adne&s;s over my mind that can never, never be di&s;pelled. Whenever they recur, a funereal veil &s;eems to me to be &s;pread over nature; and neither the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of pre&s;ent, nor the a&s;&s;urance of future &s;afety, neither the charms of &s;ociety, nor all the graces, nor all the wonder of the &s;cenes I am now con|templating, can di&s;&s;ipate the gloom.</P>
<P>Not long after the reign of Robe&s;pierre began, all pa&s;&s;ports to leave the country were refu&s;ed, and the arre&s;tation of the Engli&s;h re&s;iding in France was
<PB N="5" REF="031634_0004_0FED61D3E5ADC850">
decreed by the national convention; but the very next day the decree was repealed on the repre&s;enta|tions of &s;ome French merchants, who &s;hewed its impolicy. We therefore concluded that we had no &s;uch mea&s;ures to fear in future; and we heard from what we believed to be good anthority, that if any decree pa&s;&s;ed with re&s;pect to the Engli&s;h, it would be that of their being ordered to leave the republic. The political clouds in the mean time gathered thick round the hemi&s;phere: we heard rumours of &s;everity and terror, which &s;eemed like tho&s;e hollow noi&s;es that roll in the dark gulph of the vulcano, and portend its dangerous eruptions: but no one could calculate how far the threatened mi&s;chief would extend, and how wide a wa&s;te of ruin would de&s;olate the land. Already con&s;iderable numbers were impri&s;oned as &s;u&s;pected&mdash;<HI>&s;u&s;pected!</HI> that in|definite word, which was tortured into every mean|ing of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, and became what the French call the <HI>mot de ralliement,</HI> the initiative term of captivity and death.</P>
<P>One evening when Bernardin St. Pierre, the author of the charming little novel of Paul and Vir|ginia, was drinking tea with me, and while I was li&s;tening to a de&s;cription he gave me of a &s;mall hou&s;e which he had lately built in the centre of a beautiful i&s;land of the river that flows by E&s;&s;onne, which he was employed in decorating, and where he meant to reali&s;e &s;ome of the lovely &s;cenes which his fine imagination has pictured in the Mauritius, I was &s;uddenly called away from this fairy land by the appearance of a friend, who ru&s;hed into the room, and with great agitation told us, that a de|cree had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed in the national convention, or|dering all the Engli&s;h in France to be put into ar|re&s;tation in the &s;pace of four-and-twenty hours, and their property to be confi&s;cated. We pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="6" REF="031634_0005_0FED61FE8247A9F8">
the night without &s;leep, and the following day in anxiety and perturbation not to be de&s;cribed, ex|pecting every moment the commi&s;&s;aries of the re|volutionary committee and their guards, to put in force the mandates of the convention. As the day advanced, our terror increa&s;ed: in the evening we received information that mo&s;t of our Engli&s;h ac|quaintances were conducted to pri&s;on. At length night came; and no commi&s;&s;aries appearing, we began to flatter our&s;elves that, being a family of women, it was intended that we &s;hould be &s;pared; for the time was only now arrived when neither &s;ex nor age gave any claim to compa&s;&s;ion. Over|come with fatigue and emotion, we went to bed with &s;ome faint hopes of exemption from the gene|ral calamity of our countrymen. The&s;e hopes were however but of &s;hort duration. At two in the morning we were awakened by a loud knocking at the gate of the hotel, which we well knew to be the fatal &s;ignal of our approaching captivity; and a few minutes after the bell of our apartments was rung with violence. My &s;i&s;ter and my&s;elf hurried on our clothes and went with trembling &s;teps to the anti-chamber, when we found two commi&s;&s;aries of the revolutionary committee of our &s;ection, accom|panied by a guard, two of whom were placed at the outer door with their &s;words drawn, while the re&s;t entered the room. One of the&s;e con&s;tituted autho|rities held a paper in his hand, which was a copy of the decree of the convention, and which he offered to read to us; but we declined hearing it, and told him we were ready to obey the law. Seeing us pale and trembling, he and his colleague endeavour|ed to comfort us; they begged us to compo&s;e our|&s;elves; they repeated that our arre&s;tation was only part of a general political mea&s;ure, and that inno|cence had nothing to fear.&mdash;Alas! innocence was
<PB N="7" REF="031634_0006_0FED61966714AF38">
no longer any plea for &s;afety. They took a proc&egrave;s-verbal of our names, ages, the country where we were born, the length of time we had lived in France; and when this regi&s;ter was fini&s;hed, we were told that we mu&s;t prepare to depart. We were each of us allowed to take as much clean linen as we could tie up in a handkerchief, and which was all the property which we could now call our own; the re&s;t, in con&s;equence of the decree, being &s;eized by the nation. Sometimes, under the pre&s;|&s;ure of a great calamity, the mo&s;t acute &s;en&s;ations are excited by little circum&s;tances which form a part of the whole, and &s;erve in the retro&s;pect of memory, like certain points in a land&s;cape, to call up the &s;urrounding &s;cenery: &s;uch is the feeling with which I recall the moments when, having got out of our appartments, we &s;tood upon the &s;tair|ca&s;e &s;urrounded with guards, while the commi&s;&s;a|ries placed the &s;eals on our doors. The contra&s;t between the pri&s;on where we were going to be led, and that home which was now clo&s;ed again&s;t us, perhaps for years, filled my heart with a pang for which language has no utterance. Some of the guards were di&s;po&s;ed to treat us with rudene&s;s; which the commi&s;&s;aries &s;ternly repre&s;&s;ed, and or|dering them to keep at &s;ome di&s;tance, made us lean on their arms, for they &s;aw we &s;tood in need of &s;up|port, in our way to the committee-room. We found this place crowded with commi&s;&s;aries and &s;oldiers, &s;ome &s;leeping, &s;ome writing, and others amu&s;ing them&s;elves with plea&s;antries of a revolutionary na|ture, to which we li&s;tened trembling. Every half-hour a guard entered, conducting Engli&s;h pri&s;oners, among whom were no women but our&s;elves. Here we pa&s;&s;ed the long night; and at eight in the morning our countrymen were taken to the pri&s;on of the Madelonettes, while we were &s;till detained
<PB N="8" REF="031634_0007_0FED61D7D99869F8">
at the committee. We di&s;covered afterwards that this was owing to the humanity of the commi&s;|&s;aries who arre&s;ted us, and who &s;ent to the municipality to know if we might not be taken to the Luxembourg, where we &s;hould find good accommodations, while at the Madelonettes' &s;carce|ly a bed could be procured. All that compa&s;|&s;ion could dictate, all the lenity which it was in the power of the&s;e commi&s;&s;aries to di&s;play with|out incurring ten years impri&s;onment, the penal|ty annexed to leaving us at liberty, we experi|enced. Humanity from members of a revolutionary committee! You will perhaps exclaim in the lan|guage of the Jews, <Q>Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?</Q> It is certain, however, &s;trange as it may &s;eem, that our two commi&s;&s;aries behaved towards us as if they remembered that we were defencele&s;s women in a land of &s;trangers; that we were accu&s;ed of no crime except that of be|ing born on the &s;oil of England; and that, if we were puni&s;hed, we had only de&s;erved it by tru&s;ting with too ea&s;y a belief in that national faith which was now violated. By the way, when I tell you that we experienced compa&s;&s;ion from revolutionary committees, you will not &s;uppo&s;e I mean to a&s;&s;ert that compa&s;&s;ionate men formed the majority of their committees. The greater part of mankind in all ages, even when accu&s;tomed to the mo&s;t elevated rank, have abu&s;ed power: how then could it be hoped that unlimited power would not be abu&s;ed, which was confided to men who were for the mo&s;t part ignorant and unenlightened; men who, till that period, confined to their &s;hops and their manu|al occupations, were &s;uddenly tran&s;ported into &s;plen|did hotels, with authority to unlock cabinets blaz|ing with jewels, to &s;eize upon heaps of uncounted gold, and with a &s;troke of their pens to di&s;per&s;e as
<PB N="9" REF="031634_0008_0FED61820B5CA160">
many warrants for impri&s;onment, as caprice, envy, or mi&s;taken zeal might prompt; who were made arbiters of the liberty, property, and even lives of their fellow-citizens: and who were incited, nay even compelled, to acts of violence under the penalty of being branded with the guilt of <HI>modera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ti&s;m?</HI> When &s;uch was the new-e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem, when it required the mo&s;t daring courage to be humane, and when to be cruel was to be &s;afe, can you won|der, that among the revolutionary committees in general there was not <Q>as much pity to be found as would fill the eye of a wren?</Q> After pa&s;&s;ing the whole day as we had done the night, in the committee-room, orders arrived from the munici|pality to &s;end us to the former palace, now the pri|&s;on of the Luxembourg, where we were attended by two guards within each coach, while two walked on each &s;ide. What &s;trange &s;en&s;ations I felt as I pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;treets of Paris, and a&s;cended the &s;teps of the Luxembourg, a &s;ad &s;pectacle to the crowd! We were conducted to the range of apart|ments above the former rooms of &s;tate, where we were received with the utmo&s;t civility by the keeper of the pri&s;on, Benoit, a name which many a wretch has ble&s;&s;ed, for many a &s;orrow his compa&s;&s;ion and gentlene&s;s have &s;oftened. His heart was indeed but ill &s;uited to his office; and often he incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of tho&s;e &s;avages by whom he was employed, and who wi&s;hed their victims to feel the full extent of their calamity, unmitigated by any detail of kindne&s;s, any attention to tho&s;e little wants which this benevolent per&s;on was anxious to remove, or tho&s;e few comforts which he had the power to be&s;tow. The barbarians thought it not enough to load their victims with iron, unle&s;s "it entered into their &s;ouls." But Benoit was not to be intimidated into cruelty. Without deviating
<PB N="10" REF="031634_0009_0FED614F5A7F8DD8">
from his duty, he pur&s;ued his &s;teady cour&s;e of hu|manity; and may the grateful benedictions of the unhappy have a&s;cended for him to heaven!</P>
<P>We had a good apartment allotted us, which a few weeks before had been inhabited by Valaze, one of the deputies of the convention, who was now transferred to the pri&s;on of the Conciergerie. Our apartment, with &s;everal adjoining, had &s;oon after the event of the 31&s;t of May been prepared for the impri&s;onment of the deputies of the <HI>cot&eacute; droit;</HI> and for that purpo&s;e the windows which command|ed a fine view of the Luxembourg-gardens had been blocked up to the upper panes, which were barred with iron. Mattra&s;&s;es were provided for us in this gloomy chamber, the door of which was locked by one of our jailors; and we had &s;uffered too much fatigue of body, as well as di&s;turbance of mind, not to find a refuge from &s;orrow in &s;ome hours of pro|found &s;leep.</P>

<P>THE next morning the &s;un aro&s;e with unu&s;ual brightne&s;s; and with the aid of a table on which I mounted, I &s;aw through our grated windows the beautiful gardens of the Luxembourg. Its tall ma|je&s;tic trees had not yet lo&s;t their foliage; and though they were fallen, like our fortunes, <Q>into the &s;ear, the yellow leaf,</Q> they &s;till pre&s;ented tho&s;e rich gra|dations of colouring which belong to autumn. The &s;un gilded the Gothic &s;pires of the &s;urrounding con|vents, which lifted up their tall points above the venerable groves; while on the back-ground of the
<PB N="11" REF="031634_0010_0FED621B69132300">
&s;cenery aro&s;e the hills of Meudon. It &s;eemed to me as if the declining &s;ea&s;on had &s;hed its la&s;t inte|re&s;ting graces over the land&s;cape to &s;ooth my af|flicted &s;pirit; and &s;uch was the effect it produced. It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to contemplate the beauties of nature without that enthu&s;ia&s;tic plea&s;ure which &s;wells into devotion; and when &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions are excited in the mind, re&s;ignation to &s;ufferings, which in the &s;acred words of &s;cripture <Q>are but for a moment,</Q> becomes a le&s;s difficult duty.</P>
<P>The Luxembourg had lately been fitted up to receive the crowd of new inhabitants, with which it was going to be peopled, and every apartment obtained a particular appellation, which was in|&s;cribed on the out&s;ide of the door. We were lodged in the chamber of Cincinnatus: Brutus, I think, was our next-door neighbour; and Socrates had pitched his tent at the di&s;tance of a few paces. The chamber of <HI>Indivi&s;ibility</HI> was allotted to &s;ome per&s;ons accu&s;ed of <HI>federali&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> was writ|ten in broad characters over the door of a pri&s;oner who was <HI>au &s;ecret</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In clo&s;e confinement.</NOTE>. With re&s;pect to great names, it has been ob&s;erved in Paris that almo&s;t all the illu&s;trious characters of Greece and Rome have been led to the Guillotine&mdash;for in&s;tance, Brutus, who often, while we were in pri&s;on, came from the mu|nicipality with orders from Anaxagoras, was &s;oon after doomed to an equal fate,
<Q><L>"Alike in fortune, as alike in fame!"</L></Q>
together with Anachar&s;is, Agricola, Ari&s;tides, Pho|cion, Sempronius Gracchus, Epaminondas, Cato the elder and the younger, and many other no le&s;s
<PB N="12" REF="031634_0011_0FED62040F6A6940">
celebrated worthies, who fell in &s;ad &s;ucce&s;&s;ion under the &s;word of Maximilian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The chri&s;tian name of Robe&s;pierre.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Our pri&s;on was filled with a multitude of per&s;ons of different conditions, characters, opinions and countries, and &s;eemed an epitome of the whole world. The mornings were devoted to bu&s;ine&s;s, and pa&s;&s;ed in little occupations, of which the pri|&s;oners &s;ometimes complained, but for which per|haps they had rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on to be thankful, &s;ince le&s;s lei|&s;ure was left them to brood over their misfortunes. Every one had an appointed ta&s;k; in each chamber the pri&s;oners, by turns, lighted the fires, &s;wept the rooms, arranged the beds; and tho&s;e who could not afford to have dinner from a tavern, or, as the rich were yet permitted, from their own hou&s;es, prepared them&s;elves their meals. Every chamber formed a &s;ociety &s;ubject to certain regulations: a new pre&s;ident was cho&s;en every day, or every week, who enforced its laws and maintained good order. In &s;ome chambers no per&s;on was allowed to &s;ing after ten, in others, after eleven at night. This re&s;triction would, perhaps, have been &s;uper|fluous in England in a &s;imilar &s;ituation; but it was highly nece&s;&s;ary here, &s;ince it prevented &s;uch of the pri&s;oners as were more light-hearted than the re&s;t from &s;inging all night long, to the annoyance of others of their neighbours, who might think the mu&s;ic which re&s;ounded through the pri&s;on during the day fully &s;ufficient. The &s;y&s;tem of equality, whatever oppo&s;ition it met with in the world, was in its full extent practi&s;ed in the pri&s;on. United by the &s;trong tie of common calamity, the pri&s;oners con&s;idered them&s;elves as bound to &s;often the gene|ral evil by mutual kind offices; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and &s;trangers meeting in &s;uch circum&s;tances &s;oon became friends.
<PB N="13" REF="031634_0012_0FED61A4D54C3988">
The poor lived not upon the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table, but &s;hared the comforts of the repa&s;t; and here was found a community of the &s;mall &s;tock of goods, which belonged to the whole without the nece&s;&s;ity of a requi&s;ition. One broom, which was the property of a counte&s;s, was u&s;ed by twenty delicate hands to &s;weep the re&s;pec|tive apartments; and a tea-kettle with which a friend furni&s;hed my mother was literally, as Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved of his own, "never allowed time to cool," but was employed from morning till night in furni&s;hing the Engli&s;h with tea.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, the pri&s;oners met in an anti-chamber, which commanded a view of the gardens. Here they formed them&s;elves into groups: &s;ome conver&s;ed, others walked up and down the room; others gazed from the windows on the walks below, where, perhaps, they recogni&s;ed a relation or a friend, who being denied the privilege of vi&s;iting the pri&s;on, had come to &s;ooth them by a look or tear of &s;ympathy. During the fir&s;t days of our confinement, the pri&s;oners were permitted to &s;ee their friends; and many a &s;triking contra&s;t of gai|ety and &s;orrow did the anti-chamber then exhibit. In one part of the room, lively young people were amu&s;ing their vi&s;itors by a thou&s;and little plea&s;an|tries on their own &s;ituation; in another, a hu&s;band who was a pri&s;oner was taking leave of his wife who had come to &s;ee him, and &s;hedding tears over his child who was clinging to his knees, or had thrown its arms around his neck and refu&s;ed to be torn from its father. As the number of pri&s;oners increa&s;ed, which they did &s;o rapidly, that in le&s;s than a week they were augmented from an hundred to a thou&s;and, the rules of the pri&s;on became more &s;evere, and the admini&s;trators of the police gave &s;trict orders, that no per&s;on whatever &s;hould be
<PB N="14" REF="031634_0013_0FED616292E0A440">
admitted. After this period the wives of &s;ome of the pri&s;oners came regularly every day, bringing their children with them to the terrace of the gar|dens. You often &s;aw the mother weeping, and the children &s;tretching out their little hands and point|ing to their fathers, who &s;tood with their eyes fixed on the objects of their affection: but &s;ometimes a &s;urly &s;entinel repre&s;&s;ed the&s;e melancholy effu&s;ions of tenderne&s;s, by calling to the per&s;ons in the walk to keep off, and make no &s;igns to the pri&s;oners.&mdash;In the mean time, among the crowd that filled the public room were fine gentlemen and fine ladies, who had held the highe&s;t rank at court, &s;ome flirt|ing together, others making appointments for card parties or mu&s;ic in their own apartments in the evening, and others relating to us in pathetic lan|guage all they had &s;uffered and all they had lo&s;t by the revolution. It was impo&s;&s;ible not to &s;ympathize in the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of &s;ome, or avoid wondering at the folly of others, in whom the &s;trong &s;en&s;e of danger could not overcome the feelings of vanity; and who, although the tremendous decree had ju&s;t gone forth, making "terror the order of the day," and knowing that the fatal pre-eminence of rank was the &s;ure&s;t pa&s;&s;port to the guillotine, could not re&s;i&s;t u&s;ing the pro&s;cribed nomenclature of "Madame la duche&s;&s;e," "Mon&s;ieur le comte," &amp;c. which &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from their lips like natural melodies to which the ear has long been accu&s;tomed, and which the voice involuntarily repeats. There were, however, among the captive nobility many per&s;ons who had too much good &s;en&s;e not to ob&s;erve a dif|ferent conduct, who had proved them&s;elves real friends to liberty, had made important &s;acrifices in its cau&s;e, and who had been led to pri&s;on by revolu|tionary committees on pretences the mo&s;t trivial, and &s;ometimes from mi&s;takes the mo&s;t ludicrous.

Such was the fate of the former count and counte&s;s of&mdash;, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves from the beginning of the revolution by the ardour of their patrioti&s;m and the largene&s;s of their civic donations. They had hitherto lived undi&s;turbed in their &s;plendid hotel, and there they might probably have continued to live a little longer had not the Counte&s;s, in an evil hour, &s;ent down to her chateau a fine marble hearth, which by &s;ome accident was broken in the way. The &s;teward &s;ent a letter, in which, among other things, he mentioned that the "foyer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Foyer</HI> is the French name for hearth, and al&s;o for the central point of a &s;y&s;tem.</NOTE> mu&s;t be repaired at Paris." This letter was intercepted and read by the revolutionary com|mittee. They &s;wore, they raged at the dark de|&s;igns of ari&s;tocracy. "Here," &s;aid they, "is a daring plot indeed! a <HI>foyer</HI> of counter-revolution, and to be repaired at Paris! We mu&s;t in&s;tantly &s;eize the authors and the accomplices." In vain the Counte&s;s related the &s;tory of the hearth, and a&s;&s;erted that no con&s;piracy lurked beneath the mar|bles: both her&s;elf and her hu&s;band were conducted to the mai&s;on d'arr&ecirc;t of their &s;ection, from which we &s;aw them arrive at the Luxembourg with about &s;ixty other per&s;ons at the hour of midnight, after having been led through the &s;treets in proce&s;&s;ion by the light of an immen&s;e number of flambeaux, and guarded by a whole battalion. The&s;e pri&s;oners had at lea&s;t the con&s;olation of finding them&s;elves in the &s;ociety of many of their friends and acquaint|ances, for all the polite part of the fauxbourg St. Germain might be &s;aid to be a&s;&s;embled at the Lux|embourg in ma&s;s. Impri&s;onment here was, how|ever, no longer the exclu&s;ive di&s;tinction of former nobility, but was extended to great numbers of the
<PB N="16" REF="031634_0015_0FED6228293B86D8">
former third e&s;tate. We had prie&s;ts, phy&s;icians, merchants, &s;hop-keeper, actors and actre&s;&s;es, French valets and Engli&s;h waiting-women, all a&s;|&s;embled together in the public room; but in the private apartments Benoit's benevolent heart taught him the mo&s;t delicate &s;pecies of politene&s;s, by plac|ing tho&s;e per&s;ons together who were mo&s;t likely to find &s;atisfaction in each other's &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t many an eloquent tale of chateaux level|led with the ground, and palaces where, to borrow an image of de&s;olation from O&s;&s;ian, "the fox might be &s;een looking out at the window," we &s;ometimes heard the complaints of &s;imple &s;orrow unallied to greatne&s;s; but, like the notes of the &s;tarling, "&s;o true in time to nature were they chanted," that they &s;eized irre&s;i&s;tibly on the heart. Of this kind was a &s;cene which pa&s;&s;ed &s;ometimes between a poor Engli&s;h woman and her dog, which &s;he had brought to keep her company in her captivity. She had been hou&s;e-keeper in a French family, and, &s;ome months before &s;he was impri&s;oned, had &s;ent her daughter, who was her only child, to her friends in England. The poor woman often exclaimed, while her face was bathed in tears, "Oh, Charlotte, Charlotte, I &s;hall never &s;ee you again!" Whene|ver the dog heard the name of Charlotte, he began to howl in &s;o melancholy a note that it was impo&s;&s;i|ble not to &s;ympathi&s;e in his lamention.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t frightful circum&s;tance which attended our arre&s;tation were the vi&s;its of Henriot, the com|mandant of the military force of Paris. This wretch had been one of the executioners on the &s;e|cond of September, and was appointed by the com|mune of Paris on the 31&s;t of May to take the command of the National Guard, to point the can|non again&s;t the convention, to violate the repre|&s;entation of the people, and to act the prelude of
<PB N="17" REF="031634_0016_0FED6242E751A4B0">
that dark drama of which France has been the de|&s;olated &s;cene, and Europe the affrighted &s;pectator. Henriot performed his part &s;o much to the &s;atisfac|tion of his employers, that he was continued in his command; and it was a part of his office to vi&s;it the pri&s;ons, and take care that they were properly guarded. The fir&s;t time I &s;aw him was the day after our confinement. He entered on a &s;udden our apartment, brandi&s;hing his &s;word, and accom|panied by twelve of his officers. There was &s;ome|thing in his look which did not give you &s;imply the idea of the ferocity which is &s;ometimes to be found among civilized Europeans: his fiercene&s;s &s;eemed to be of that kind which belongs to a cannibal of New Zealand; and he looked not merely as if he longed to plunge his &s;abre in our bo&s;oms, but to drink a libation of our blood. He poured forth a volley of oaths and imprecations, called out to know how many guillotines mu&s;t be erected for the Engli&s;h, and did not leave our chamber till one per|&s;on who was pre&s;ent had fainted with terror. In this manner he vi&s;ited every apartment, &s;preading con&s;ternation and di&s;may; and the&s;e vi&s;its were re|peated three or four times in a week. Whenever the trampling of his hor&s;e's feet was heard in the court-yard, the fir&s;t pri&s;oner who di&s;tingui&s;hed the well-known &s;ound gave the alarm, and in one mo|ment the public room was cleared; every per&s;on flying with the precipitation of fear to his own apartment. Every noi&s;e was in&s;tantly hu&s;hed; a &s;tillne&s;s like that of death prevaded the whole dwel|ling; and we remained crouching in our cells, like the Greeks in the cave of Polyphemus, till the mon&s;ter di&s;appeared. The vi&s;its of the admini&s;tra|tors of police, though not &s;o terrific as tho&s;e of Henriot, were nothing le&s;s than &s;oothing. Bruta|lity, as well as terror, was the order of day;
<PB N="18" REF="031634_0017_0FED61F264BEDC40">
and tho&s;e public functionaries, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was not only to &s;ee that the police of the pri&s;on was well regulated, but al&s;o to hear if the pri&s;oners had any &s;ubject of complaint, u&s;ed to make the enquiry in a tone of &s;uch ferocity, that, whatever oppre&s;&s;ions might hang on the heart, the lips lo&s;t the power of giving them utterance. The vi&s;its of the police generally produced &s;ome additional rigour to our confinement; and in a &s;hort time all acce&s;s to us whatever was forbidden ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">pt by letters, which were &s;ent open, and delivered to us after being ex|amined by the &s;entinels. There was &s;ometimes room for deep meditation on the &s;trange caprice and vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune. We found the ex-mini&s;ter Amelot a pri&s;oner in the Luxembourg; he, who during his admini&s;tration had di&s;tributed letters de cachet with &s;o much liberality. Tyranny had now changed its in&s;truments, and he was become him|&s;elf the victim of de&s;poti&s;m with new in&s;ignia; the <HI>blue ribband</HI> had given place to the <HI>red cap,</HI> and "de par le roi" was transformed into "par me&s;ure de &s;uret&eacute; generale." By his order La Tude, who&s;e hi&s;tory is &s;o well known, had been confined thirty years in the Ba&s;tille. He was now enjoying the &s;weets of liberty; and, before the pri&s;on-doors were &s;hut again&s;t &s;trangers, came frequently to vi&s;it &s;ome of his friends in the very room where the mi|ni&s;ter was impri&s;oned.</P>
<P>Amelot, in a comfortable apartment and &s;ur|rounded by &s;ociety, did not bear his confinement with the &s;ame firmne&s;s as La Tude had borne the &s;olitude of his dungeon, cheered only by the plain|tive &s;ounds of his flute of reeds. He was in a &s;hort time bereft of his rea&s;on; and, among the wanderings of his imagination, u&s;ed to addre&s;s let|ters to all the kings of Europe and all the emigrant princes, inviting them to &s;umptuous repa&s;ts, to
<PB N="19" REF="031634_0018_0FED61DF14151918">
which he &s;ometimes propo&s;ed admitting the na|tional convention, to &s;hew that he was above bear|ing malice.</P>
<P>Whenever any new pri&s;oners arrived, the re&s;t crowded around them, and ha&s;tened to calm their minds by the mo&s;t &s;oothing expre&s;&s;ions of &s;ympa|thy. Not &s;uch were the emotions excited by the appearance of Maillard, who was one of the mur|derers on the &s;econd of September, and who had lately been appointed to a command in the revolu|tionary army; from which, for &s;ome malver&s;ations, he was now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, &s;ent to pri&s;on, and ordered into clo&s;e confinement. He had taken a very ac|tive part in the late tran&s;actions, and had a few days before his own arre&s;t, conducted to pri&s;on two fine boys, who were the &s;ons of the ex-mi|ni&s;ter La Tour du Pin, together with their gover|nor, who was a prie&s;t. They were &s;tepping into a carriage, which was to convey them to &s;chool, when they were &s;eized upon by Maillard, who tak|ing the younge&s;t, a child of eleven years of age, by the &s;houlder, &s;aid to him in a &s;tern accent, "Il faut dire la verit&eacute;, toute la verit&eacute;, et rien que la verit&eacute;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">You mu&s;t &s;peak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.</NOTE>." No &s;ooner was Maillard brought into the anti-chamber, while his room was preparing, than the little boy recognized his acquaintance, and running up to him cried, "Bon jour, citoyen Maillard&mdash;il faut dire la verit&eacute;, toute la verit&eacute;, et rien que la verit&eacute;."</P>
<P>Nothing could be more painful than the &s;en&s;a|tions excited by reading the evening papers, which the pri&s;oners were at this time permitted to receive, and which were expected with that trembling anxi|ety with which, under pre&s;ent evils, we long to
<PB N="20" REF="031634_0019_0FED325596173A48">
look into the promi&s;es of futurity. The evening paper &s;eemed to us the book of our de&s;tiny; but there we could trace no &s;oothing characters of hope, or mercy. Every line was &s;tamped with con&s;piracy, vengeance, de&s;olation, and death; and the reading the events of the day left impre&s;&s;ions on our minds which often deprived us of &s;leep. We &s;ometimes quitted the crowd in the public room, and, &s;hutting our&s;elves up in our own a|partment, endeavoured, amid&s;t the evils of this world, like Sterne's monk, to look beyond it.

<P>THE days of my captivity are often brought back to my remembrance, by circum&s;tances which &s;eem &s;ufficiently remote from &s;orrows; by that con|nexion of the pa&s;t with the pre&s;ent, which Aken|&s;ide de&s;cribes &s;o beautifully<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plea&s;ures of Imagination, book iii.</NOTE>: and you will perhaps think that my imagination is &s;omewhat di&s;ordered, when I tell you that the lake, from the luxuriant banks of which I &s;end you this letter, recalls to my mind our apartment in the pri&s;on. The walls of that apartment were hung with tape&s;try which de|&s;cribed a land&s;cape of romantic beauty. On that
<PB N="21" REF="031634_0020_0FED61E5B06B7260">
land&s;cape I often gazed till I almo&s;t per&s;uaded my|&s;elf that the &s;cenery was alive around me, &s;o much did I delight in the plea&s;ing illu&s;ion. How often, while my eyes were fixed on that canvas which led my wounded &s;pirit from the cruelty of man to the benignity of God&mdash;how often did I wi&s;h "for the wings of a dove, that I might flee away and be at re&s;t!" To be &s;eated at the foot of tho&s;e &s;hel|tering hills which embo&s;omed &s;ome mimic habita|tions, or beneath a mighty elm which ro&s;e maje&s;|tically in the fore-ground of the piece, and &s;pread its thick foliage over a green &s;lope, appeared to me the &s;ummit of earthly felicity. Tho&s;e hills, the torrent-&s;tream which rolled down their &s;teep &s;ides, the &s;hady elm, and all the objects on the tape&s;try, are indelibly impre&s;&s;ed on my memory; and often when I am wandering through the charming &s;cenes of Switzerland, a country which nature &s;eems to have created more for ornament than u&s;e, where &s;he has &s;pread over every land&s;cape tho&s;e lavi&s;h graces which in other regions belong only to a few favoured &s;pots, I have felt my eyes bathed in tears, while, amid&s;t views of overwhelming great|ne&s;s, &s;ome minute object unob&s;erved by others has led <HI>my</HI> imagination to the tape&s;try and the pri&s;on. A few days &s;ince I pa&s;&s;ed along the falls of the Te&s;&s;ino, rolling through narrow clif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s under rocks of the mo&s;t terrific form, in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tor|rents, &s;weeping after each other down the abrupt de&s;cent, and broken in their cour&s;e by enormous fragments torn from the cliffs; &s;ometimes rai&s;ing their &s;cattered &s;urges into thin air, and &s;ometimes di&s;playing the pri&s;matic colours on the foam. While I was &s;tanding on one of tho&s;e daring bridges that are thrown acro&s;s the gulph, and that tradition calls the work of &s;upernatural agency, after the fir&s;t tran&s;port of admiration, in which

<P>I have yet only given you a general outline of our pri&s;on; but there was one &s;cene of calamity which my&s;elf and my family were alone doomed to witne&s;s, and of which our fellow captives had no &s;hare. Our apartment, with two others adjoin|ing, was &s;eparated from the public room by a little pa&s;&s;age, and a door which the hui&s;&s;iers carefully locked at night. It happened that the&s;e apartments were then occupied by two per&s;ons in who&s;e &s;ocie|ty we had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the mo&s;t agreeable hours of our re&s;idence in France. The&s;e per&s;ons were Sillery and La Source, two of the members of the convention, who had been long in clo&s;e confine|ment, and who were now on the point of appear|ing before that &s;anguinary tribunal whence, after the mo&s;t &s;hocking mockery of ju&s;tice, they were inhumanly dragged to the &s;caffold. Sillery on ac|count of his infirmities, had with much difficulty obtained permi&s;&s;ion from the police for his &s;ervant to be admitted into the pri&s;on during the day, to|gether with an old female friend, who, on the plea of his illne&s;s, had implored leave to attend him as his nur&s;e, with that eloquence which be|longs to affliction, and which &s;ometimes even the
<PB N="23" REF="031634_0022_0FED622CA4B2AF10">
mo&s;t hardened hearts are unable to re&s;i&s;t. While men a&s;&s;ume over our &s;ex &s;o many claims of &s;upe|riority, let them at lea&s;t be&s;tow on us the palm of con&s;tancy, and allow that in the fidelity of our attachments we have the right of pre-eminence. Tho&s;e pri&s;ons from which men &s;hrunk back with terror, and where they often left their friends abandoned le&s;t they &s;hould be involved in their fate&mdash;women, in whom the force of &s;en&s;ibility over|came the fears of female weakne&s;s, demanded and &s;ometimes obtained permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it, in defiance of all the dangers that &s;urrounded their gloomy walls. Sillery's friend and his &s;ervant being al|lowed to go in and out of his apartment, the door was not kept con&s;tantly locked, although he and La Source were clo&s;ely confined, and not permit|ted to have any communication with the other pri&s;oners. The &s;econd night of our abode in the Luxembourg, when the pri&s;oners had retired to their re&s;pective chambers, and the keeper had lock|ed the outer door which enclo&s;ed our three apart|ments, La Source entered our room. Oh! how different was this interview from tho&s;e meetings of &s;ocial enjoyment that were embelli&s;hed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e charms of his conver&s;ation, always di&s;tingui&s;hed by a flow of eloquence, and animated by that enthu&s;ia&s;tic fervour which peculiarly belonged to his character! La Source was a native of Langue|doc, und united with very &s;uperior talents, that vi|vid warmth of imagination for which the &s;outhern provinces of France have been renowned &s;ince the period when, awakened by the genial influence of tho&s;e luxuriant regions, the &s;ong of the Trouba|dours bur&s;t from the gloom of Gothic barbari&s;m. Liberty in the &s;oul of La Source was le&s;s a prin|ciple than a pa&s;&s;ion for his bo&s;om beat high with philanthropy; and in his former &s;ituation as a pro|te&s;tant
<PB N="24" REF="031634_0023_0FED623082349B10">
mini&s;ter he had felt in a peculiar manner the oppre&s;&s;ion of the ancient &s;y&s;tem. His &s;en&s;ibi|lity was acute, and his dete&s;tation of the crimes by which the revolution had been &s;ullied, was in pro|portion to his devoted attachment to its cau&s;e. La Source was polite and amiable in his manners: he had a ta&s;te for mu&s;ic, and a powerful voice; and &s;ung, as he conver&s;ed, with all the energy of feel|ing. After the day had pa&s;&s;ed in the fatigue of public debates, he was glad to lay a&s;ide the tumult of politics in the evening, for the conver&s;ation of &s;ome literary men whom he met occa&s;ionally at our tea-table. Ah! how little did we then fore&s;ee the horrors of that period when we &s;hould meet him in the gloom of a pri&s;on, a pro&s;cribed victim, with whom this melancholy interview was be&s;et with danger!</P>
<P>We were obliged to conver&s;e in whi&s;pers, while we kept watch &s;ucce&s;&s;ively at the outer door, that if any &s;tep approached he might in&s;tantly fly to his chamber. He had much to a&s;k, having been three months a clo&s;e pri&s;oner, and knowing little of what was pa&s;&s;ing in the world; and though he &s;eemed to forget all the horrors of his &s;ituation in the con&s;olation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> derived from the&s;e moments of confidential conver&s;ation, yet he frequently lament|ed, that this la&s;t gleam of plea&s;ure which was &s;hed over his exi&s;tence was purcha&s;ed at the price of our captivity. In the &s;olitude of his pri&s;on, no voice of friend&s;hip, no accents of pity had reached his ear; and after our arrival, he u&s;ed through the lonely day to count the hours till the pri&s;on-gates were clo&s;ed, till all was &s;till within its walls, and no &s;ound was heard without, except at intervals the hoar&s;e cry of the &s;entinels, when he ha&s;tened to our apartment. The di&s;covery of the&s;e vi&s;its would indeed have expo&s;ed us to the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences; but our &s;ympathy prevailed over
<PB N="25" REF="031634_0024_0FED61AE37DF63F8">
our fears; nor could we, whatever might be the event, refu&s;e our devoted friend this la&s;t melancho|ly &s;atisfaction. La Source at his &s;econd vi&s;it was accompanied by Sillery, the hu&s;band of Madame de Sillery, who&s;e writings are &s;o well known in England. Sillery was about &s;ixty years of age; had lived freely, like mo&s;t men of his former rank in France; and from this di&s;&s;ipated life had more the appearance of age than belonged to his years. His manners retained the elegance, by which that cla&s;s was di&s;tingui&s;hed which Mr. Burke has de|nominated "the Corinthian capital of poli&s;hed &s;o|ciety." Sillery had a fine ta&s;te for drawing, and during his confinement di&s;played the powers of his pencil by tracing beautiful land&s;capes. He al&s;o amu&s;ed him&s;elf by reading hi&s;tory; and, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing con&s;iderable talents for literature, had recorded with a rich warmth of colouring the events of the revolution, in which he had been a di&s;tingui&s;hed actor, and of which he had trea&s;ured up details precious for hi&s;tory. With keen regret he told me that he had committed &s;everal volumes of ma|nu&s;cript to the flames, a &s;ad &s;acrifice to the Omars of the day.</P>
<P>The mind of Sillery was &s;omewhat le&s;s fortified again&s;t his approaching fate than that of La Source. The old man often turned back on the pa&s;t and wept, and &s;ometimes enquired with an anxious look, if we believed there was any chance of his deliverance. Alas! I have no words to paint the &s;en&s;ations of tho&s;e moments!&mdash;To know that the days of our fellow-captives were numbered&mdash;that they were doomed to peri&s;h&mdash;that the bloody tri|bunal before which they were going to appear, was but the path-way to the &s;caffold&mdash;to have the pain|ful ta&s;k of &s;tifling our feelings, while we endea|voured to &s;ooth the weakne&s;s of humanity by
<PB N="26" REF="031634_0025_0FED616A33B5C718">
hopes which we knew were fallacious, was a &s;pe|cies of mi&s;ery almo&s;t in&s;upportable. There were moments indeed, when the ta&s;k became too pain|ful to be endured. There are moments when, &s;hocked by &s;ome new incident of terror, this cruel re&s;traint gave way to uncontrolable emotion; when the tears, the &s;obbings of convul&s;ive angui&s;h would no longer be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and our unfortu|nate friends were obliged to give in&s;tead of re|ceiving con&s;olation.</P>
<P>They had in their calamity that &s;upport which is of all others the mo&s;t effectual under misfortune. Religion was in La Source a habit of the mind. Impre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t &s;ublime ideas of the Su|preme Being, although the ways of heaven never appeared more dark and intricate than in this tri|umph of guilt over innocence, he repo&s;ed with un|bounded confidence in that Providence in who&s;e hand are the i&s;&s;ues of life and death. Sillery, who had a feeling heart, found devotion the mo&s;t &s;ooth|ing refuge of affliction. He and La Source com|po&s;ed together a little hymn adapted to a &s;weet &s;o|lemn air, which they called their evening &s;ervice. Every night before we parted they &s;ung this &s;im|ple dirge in a low tone to prevent their being heard in the other apartments, which made it &s;eem more plaintive. Tho&s;e mournful &s;ounds, the knell of my departing friends, yet thrill upon my heart!</P>

<P>La Source often &s;poke of his wife with tender regret. He had been married only a week, when he was cho&s;en a member of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;em|bly, and was obliged to ha&s;ten to Paris, while his wife remained in Languedoc to take care of an aged mother. When the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly was di&s;&s;olved, La Source was immediately elected a member of the national convention, and could find no interval in which to vi&s;it his native &s;pot, or his wife, whom he &s;aw no more. In his meditations on the chain of political events, he mentioned one little incident which &s;eemed to hang on his mind with a &s;ort of &s;uper&s;titious feeling. A few days after the tenth of Augu&s;t he dined in the fauxbourg of St. Antoine with &s;everal members of the legi&s;|lative a&s;&s;embly, who were the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for their talents and patrioti&s;m. They were ex|ulting
<PB N="29" REF="031634_0028_0FED617707BD7DB8">
in the birth of the new republic, and the glorious part they were to act as its founders, when a citizen of the fauxbourg, who had been in|vited to partake of the repa&s;t, ob&s;erved, that he feared a different de&s;tiny awaited them. "As you have been the founders of the republic," &s;aid he, "you will al&s;o be its victims. In a &s;hort time you will be obliged to impo&s;e re&s;traints and duties on the people, to whom your enemies and theirs will repre&s;ent you as having overthrown regal power only to e&s;tabli&s;h your own. You will be ac|cu&s;ed of ari&s;trocacy; and I fore&s;ee," he added with much perturbation, "that you will all peri&s;h on the &s;caffold." The company &s;miled at his &s;ingular pre|diction: but during the en&s;uing winter, when the &s;torm was gathering over the political horizon, La Source recalled the prophecy, and &s;ometimes re|minded Vergniaud of the man of the fauxbourg St. Antoine. Vergniaud had little heeded the au|gur; but a few days previous to the 31&s;t of May, when the convention was for the fir&s;t time be&s;ieg|ed, La Source &s;aid again to Vergniaud, "Well, what think you of the prophet of the fauxbourg?" "The prophet of the fauxbourg," an&s;wered Verg|niaud, "was in the right."</P>
<P>The morning now arrived when La Source and Sillery, together with nineteen other members of the convention, were led before the revolutionary tribunal. When the guards who were to conduct them arrived, the other pri&s;oners crowded to the public room to &s;ee them pa&s;s, and we &s;hut our|&s;elves up in our own apartment. They returned about five in the evening; &s;oon after which their coun&s;el arrived, and we had no opportunity of &s;eeing them till midnight, when they related to us what had pa&s;&s;ed. The conduct of the judges and

the a&s;pect of the jury were calculated to bani&s;h every gleam of hope from the bo&s;oms of the pri|&s;oners; the former permitted with reluctance any thing to be urged in their defence, and the latter li&s;tened with impatience, ca&s;ting upon their victims looks of atrocity in which they might ea&s;ily read their fate: yet in &s;pite of the&s;e unhappy omens our friends returned from the tribunal with their minds much elevated. La Source de&s;cribed in his eloquent language the noble enthu&s;ia&s;m of liberty, the ardent love of their country, the heroical con|tempt of death which animated his colleagues, whom he had not &s;een for &s;ome time, &s;ince they had been transferred to the Conciergerie, while him&s;elf and Sillery had obtained permi&s;&s;ion to re|main at the Luxembourg upon the certificates of their phy&s;icians, that they were too ill to be re|moved without danger. La Source declared that ancient hi&s;tory offered no model of public virtue beyond that which was exhibited by his friends at the tribunal, and who in their pri&s;on, blending with the fortitude of Romans the gaiety of French|men, and being confined in one apartment, pa&s;&s;ed the &s;hort interval of life which was left in con|ver&s;ation, and cheerful repa&s;ts which were u&s;u|ally concluded with patriotic &s;ongs. "You," &s;aid Vergniaud to La Source when they met at the tribunal, "you perhaps will find &s;omething to regret in the lo&s;s of life. You have a glimp&s;e of the gardens of the Luxembourg, which may remind you that there is &s;omething beautiful in nature: but we who live in human &s;hambles, who every day &s;ee fre&s;h victims dragged to execution, we are become &s;o familiarized with death, that we look on it with unconcern.</P>
<P>A few days before this &s;anguinary trial ended, the admini&s;tration of the police &s;ent orders that

the Engli&s;h-women confined in the Luxembourg &s;hould be removed the next day to a convent in the fauxbourg St. Antoine. With what keen regret La Source and Sillery received this intelligence! A thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times they thanked us for the dangers we had ri&s;qued in receiving them, and for the &s;ympathy which had &s;oothed the la&s;t hours of their exi&s;tence&mdash;a thou&s;and times they declared, that if it were po&s;&s;ible their lives might be pre&s;erved, they &s;hould con&s;ider them&s;elves for ever bound to us by the mo&s;t &s;acred ties of gra|titude and friend&s;hip: but they felt, alas! how &s;mall was the chance that we &s;hould meet again in this world. Sillery cut off a lock of his white hairs, which he begged I would pre&s;erve for his &s;ake, and La Source gave me the &s;ame relic. They embraced us with much emotion. They prayed that the ble&s;&s;ing of God might be upon us: we mingled our tears together, and parted to meet no more!&mdash;</P>
<P>Let me, before I conduct you to our new pri|&s;on, give you a &s;hort account of the political events and their cau&s;es, which, after bringing tho&s;e mem|bers of the convention to the &s;caffold who were mo&s;t fitted by their talents to defend liberty, and by their moral qualities to make it beloved, ended in &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of cruelty and crimes, that it can be only by a long per&s;everance in public virtue that France can make reparation to humanity, or retrieve her character among the nations.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE republican party of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;em|bly had, it is well known, very early projected many alterations in the new con&s;titution. They had ob&s;erved with great inquietude the changes which had taken place at the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t na|tional a&s;&s;embly, when its labours underwent a re|vi&s;ion previou&s;ly to the acceptance of the con&s;titu|tion by the executive power, and when they found that tho&s;e who had hitherto been the mo&s;t &s;trenu|ous opponents of the court &s;uddenly became its mo&s;t zealous advocates and friends.</P>
<P>Though this party formed the minority of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, its influence by means of the popular &s;ocieties was very exten&s;ive. But when the &s;truggle took place between the court and the republican party, both of which were at length agreed in the overthrow of the new con&s;titution, with which each was for different rea&s;ons equal|ly di&s;&s;atisfied, the party was joined by many who in this de&s;truction of the regal authority had no other end in view than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their own.</P>
<P>The &s;ociety of the Jacobins, which had been for a long time the rival and at length the conqueror of the throne, was de&s;erted immediately after the victory by almo&s;t all tho&s;e who had contributed to gain it. They imagined that every dome&s;tic ene|my was annihilated when the fir&s;t decree of the convention changed the monarchy into a republic; and though &s;ymptoms of di&s;content di&s;covered them&s;elves among &s;ome who thought that the change had been too ha&s;tily decided on, and &s;ymp|toms

of a more dangerous and fatal tendency to the welfare of the government had already appear|ed among others, yet tho&s;e to whom the people had given their confidence were not &s;ufficiently aware of the in&s;tability of popular favour, and the precarious tenure by which they held it. The commune of Paris claimed an equal right to &s;hare with the Jacobins the honours of the triumph over royalty; but di&s;&s;atisfied with the little credit given to the &s;ervices it had rendered during the &s;truggle, it took advantage of the imbecility of the legi&s;la|tive a&s;&s;embly then expiring, and had already erect|ed it&s;elf into a rival power before the convention had opened its fir&s;t debates. The pretence of making extraordinary exertions to oppo&s;e the march of the enemy towards Paris had led the commune, amid&s;t a multiplicity of other acts of rebellion, to arrogate the functions of the repre&s;entatives of the people; and having at the fatal period of the ma&s;|&s;acre of September humbled the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;em|bly to the du&s;t, they thought that the &s;ame daring conduct would give them the &s;ame &s;uperiority over the national convention. But in this calculation they were deceived. Robe&s;pierre and his adhe|rents, who had hitherto directed their coun&s;els, now a&s;pired to higher de&s;tinies; and, though &s;oli|citous to make the commune an auxiliary in their de&s;igns, were unwilling that it &s;hould become their rival. In the new election of repre&s;entatives, all tho&s;e were excluded who had been influenced by the court, or who had oppo&s;ed from purer motives the republican party. Although this party gained a con&s;iderable reinforcement by the new election, yet the dread of returning royalty, with all the &s;e|verity of the old &s;y&s;tem, had operated &s;o power|fully on the minds of the people of the depart|ments, that many deputies were cho&s;en who&s;e pre|ten&s;ions
<PB N="34" REF="031634_0033_0FED618678309908">
to this tru&s;t aro&s;e more from the &s;trength of their lungs than of their talents, and who&s;e ha|rangues made up in noi&s;e what they wanted in ar|gument; while the &s;till greater dread of the return of tho&s;e horrors which the commune had ju&s;t been exerci&s;ing had &s;o intimidated the citizens of Paris, that a part of their deputation to the convention, at the head of which was Robe&s;pierre, triumphing over the fears they had excited, took their feats rather as the conquerors than the repre&s;entatives of the people. The conduct of the officers of the municipality, however, called aloud for puni&s;hment. It was impo&s;&s;ible for the convention to &s;uffer the crimes they had committed, and the &s;till greater atrocities which they had meditated, to pa&s;s unno|ticed. The council-general of the commune were called to the bar, but e&s;caped ju&s;tice by di&s;&s;embled profe&s;&s;ions of repentence, and the promi&s;e of deli|vering up tho&s;e who had led them to the commi&s;|&s;ion of &s;uch enormities. Had the convention, while its rival was thus &s;ubdued, proceeded to di&s;|tingui&s;h between tho&s;e who had been the chiefs of the con&s;piracy and tho&s;e who had been the dupes of their impo&s;ture, they would have done a great act of national ju&s;tice, and would have cru&s;hed any far|ther attempts again&s;t the national honour. But as this humiliation of the commune was a contrivance to e&s;cape examination, of which the con&s;pirators who directed its operations, and who had been cho&s;en &s;ince to the convention, were afraid; the a&s;&s;embly, deceived by this artifice, had no &s;ooner granted the pardon they implored, than the faction, emboldened by impunity, perceived that with au|dacity and pre&s;everance they might yet attain the end to which they a&s;pired. While Robe&s;pierre &s;at in the commune, his object was probably to
<PB N="35" REF="031634_0034_0FED62002D4F80A8">
frame a government of municipalities, of which Paris was to be the chief, and him&s;elf the dictator: but his enterpri&s;e being encompa&s;&s;ed with difficulty, &s;ince the people had determined to have a national convention, he afterwards changed his mea&s;ures, and began to meditate a plan of making the con|vention it&s;elf, of which he was now a member, &s;erve as the in&s;trument of his u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>With this view, he and his di&s;organizing faction in the convention a&s;&s;umed the direction of the mu|nicipality; and as the &s;ociety of the Jacobins was de&s;erted by the republicans, who thought its &s;er|vices no longer nece&s;&s;ary, the name and the place were &s;eized on by the con&s;pirators, and filled with intriguing and ambitious men, who&s;e hopes of &s;har|ing in the plunder or the power induced them to become accomplices in the guilt.</P>
<P>While the municipality laboured to win over the &s;ections of Paris, the Jacobins made pro&s;elytes to their &s;y&s;tem of anarchy by their affiliations and corre&s;pondence in the departments; and before the exi&s;ting government was fully aware of the extent of the con&s;piracy, or could collect &s;ufficient ener|gy to counteract it, the faction had gained a mo&s;t alarming a&s;cendency; and although they formed a very &s;mall minority in the convention, their influ|ence both in the executive part of the government and among&s;t the con&s;tituted authorities was &s;uffici|ent to outweigh that of the repre&s;entation it&s;elf. Every conce&s;&s;ion made to the con&s;pirators &s;erved only to increa&s;e the in&s;olence of their demands; and although the mo&s;t eloquent members of the convention, Guadet, Vergniaud, Pethion, Louvet, Bri&s;&s;ot and La Source gave ince&s;&s;ant warnings of the progre&s;s of the anarchi&s;ts towards the di&s;&s;olu|tion of all order in the &s;tate, yet like Ca&s;&s;andra

This is the faction which has i&s;&s;ued its arbitrary mandates, which has ordered the arre&s;t of eight of my colleagues who &s;at in the legi&s;la|tive a&s;&s;embly, which has paid robbers to plunder and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to murder, and which has had the audacity to lay to the charge of the people the crimes which it&s;elf has perpetrated. Were I in going from this place to fall under the poniards of the&s;e traitors, I &s;hould die &s;atisfied in having lifted up the veil which conceals them: a lit|tle longer and I will unma&s;k them altogether." Guadet often de|tailed the con&s;piracy of the Jacobins and the municipality, and, with bur&s;ts of hone&s;t indignation again&s;t the&s;e &s;hamele&s;s traitors, im|plored the convention to &s;ave the republic by di&s;&s;olving the &s;ociety and re-electing the commune. Vergniaud with more than u&s;ual eloquence pourtrayed the con&s;pirators. Louvet gave a clear and admirable detail of their attempts to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the convention in the con&s;piracy of 10th of March; and Bri&s;&s;ot unveiled their trea|&s;on not only in the convention and in his journal, but in different publications, of which his addre&s;s to his con&s;tituents publi&s;hed in May 1794 will furni&s;h intere&s;ting matter for hi&s;tory.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>However criminal this band of con&s;pirators, who have exerci&s;ed a de&s;poti&s;m more hideous than hi&s;to|ry has ever pre&s;ented, may appear, or whatever be the regrets we feel for tho&s;e virtuous friends of li|berty who fell the victims of their rage, the hi&s;torian, more impartial than the friend, will not fail to ani|madvert on the negligence of which in &s;ome in&s;tanc|es they were guilty, and above all in carele&s;sly throwing a&s;ide, by the de&s;ertion of the Jacobin &s;o|ciety, the means which they had obtained of inform|ing the public mind and directing its will.</P>
<P>But before we carry our cen&s;ures too far, we mu&s;t recollect that they had to contend again&s;t men hardened in crimes and inacce&s;&s;ible to &s;hame, who found refuge from the detection of their guilt in the protection of their party, and who returned the thun|der of the patriots in the convention by their noi&s;y vociferations at the Jacobins and the commune.</P>

The fir&s;t attempt made on the national repre&s;en|tation by the commune of Paris and the Jacobins, ought to have been puni&s;hed as an act of rebellion again&s;t the &s;overeignty of the people. But an ill-judged application of the principles of individual li|berty, a too delicate regard for the rights of per&s;ons, led on the majority of the convention to the permi&s;|&s;ion of offences, of which they took no mea&s;ures to &s;top the progre&s;s, till the con&s;piracy had acquired &s;uch &s;trength as made every exertion again&s;t it in|effectual.</P>
<P>The trea&s;on of Dumourier had furni&s;hed the fac|tion with new re&s;ources for calumny again&s;t the re|publican party, with &s;ome of whom he had former|ly been connected: for, as the faction was in the con&s;tant habit of denouncing indi&s;criminately every agent of the republic, the completion of one pro|phecy gave an air of credit to the re&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The con&s;pirators accu&s;ed the republicans of being accomplices in Dumourier's trea&s;on; the republicans have retorted the charge on &s;ome of their adver&s;aries with the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable evidence. But we need not here recur to con&s;piracies either of Jacobins or Girondi&s;ts to di&s;cern the motives of Dumourier's conduct. He has endeavoured to explain it him&s;elf in his memoirs; to which if any credit ought to be given, the Girondi&s;ts will be ab&s;olved from all &s;hare in his trea&s;on. But their innocence in this re&s;pect, as well as their political integrity in every other, is now e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond the reach of calumny and detraction.</NOTE>. Although the con&s;pirators had acquired con&s;iderable influence from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance given them by the commune and the Jacobins, they perceived that the object which they had in view, would never fully be attained till they had gained &s;o ab&s;olute a controul over the con|vention, as to make it, like the ancient parliaments, the regi&s;ters of their imperial edicts. To this end all their efforts were directed: but while tho&s;e men &s;till &s;at within its walls who&s;e virtue and eloquence had hitherto warded off the blow which menaced
<PB N="38" REF="031634_0037_0FED62334A17DCC0">
their country, there was little hope of &s;ucce&s;s. The prize &s;et before the&s;e traitors was too great to &s;uf|fer them to he&s;itate about the means of &s;eizing it; and having thrown a&s;ide all regard to the laws, all re&s;pect for individual or political liberty, they con|ceived the project of violating the national repre|&s;entation it&s;elf, and tearing from it the mo&s;t elo|quent and intrepid defenders of its rights. To car|ry their plot into execution, it was nece&s;&s;ary to co|ver it with the veil of the wi&s;h of the people, of whom a few hired de&s;peradoes and other ignorant and &s;educed per&s;ons became the repre&s;entatives, bearing petitions written by the con&s;pirators them&s;elves, praying the convention to drive from their &s;eats a certain number whom they marked as unworthy of their confidence or that of the nation. The indig|nation of the convention being rou&s;ed at the&s;e at|tempts, they in&s;tituted a commi&s;&s;ion of enquiry to &s;earch into the cau&s;es of this con&s;piracy. This commi&s;&s;ion, in pur&s;uance of the powers it had re|ceived, after mature examination, arre&s;ted Hebert, one of the municipal chiefs, and gave notice to the convention that they were prepared to make their report. The con&s;pirators &s;eeing that their crimes were on the point of being brought to light, the di&s;covery of which would annihilate their project, threw off the ma&s;k, and brought forward the com|mune of Paris to demand not only the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the commi&s;&s;ion which the convention had created, but the arre&s;tation of the members who compo&s;ed it, together with the twenty-two deputies of the convention the mo&s;t eminent for their virtue and ta|lents. The convention for &s;everal days with&s;tood every effort that was made to &s;hake its firmne&s;s. The pre&s;ident I&s;nard, with all the warmth of ho|ne&s;t indignation, threatened in the name of the re|public the liberticide factioners of the commune,
<PB N="39" REF="031634_0038_0FED618A58E8D0D8">
that if they dared to proceed to the execution of tho&s;e de&s;igns which their pre&s;ent mea&s;ures indicated, if the national repre&s;entation &s;hould be violated by any of tho&s;e con&s;piracies of which they had been the accomplices, that Paris &s;hould be blotted out from the re&s;t of its cities, and that the traveller &s;hould wander on the banks of the Seine enquiring where it once &s;tood.</P>
<P>The chiefs of the con&s;piracy had proceeded too far to be &s;topped in their career by &s;uch con&s;idera|tions as the&s;e; but they found more intrepidity and firmne&s;s in the convention than they expected, and therefore determined to employ their la&s;t expedient. The ringing of the toc&s;in and the firing of alarm guns had excited the attention of the citizens of Pa|ris for two days, when on the third the beating to arms informed them that they were going to be put into in&s;urrection. The national guard being thus put into in&s;urrection, the cau&s;e of which was un|known, the whole body were conducted to the hall of the convention, where Henriot the commander of the military force, who had been created by the con&s;pirators for that purpo&s;e, had ordered them to a&s;&s;emble. The convention was &s;urrounded till nearly midnight by the military force, nor was any member permitted to leave the hall; but although be&s;ieged, the a&s;&s;embly was not yet conquered. The day pa&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t frightful tumult, and Rabaut de St. Etienne in vain &s;tood at the tribune, holding in his hand the report of the commi&s;&s;ion of twelve upon the con&s;piracy of the commune, together with the proofs of its authenticity. His voice was lo&s;t in the horrible vociferations of the tribunes, and the murmurs of the faction within the hall. At length finding all his efforts ineffectual, he left the a&s;&s;em|bly in de&s;pair.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="031634_0039_0FED61CF76EC39F8">
The a&s;&s;ault of the convention on the 31&s;t of May, though it had produced the mo&s;t horrible di&s;order, had not forced from the a&s;&s;embly the decree of arre&s;|tation. But Robe&s;pierre with his commune, his Jacobins, and his body guard of revolutionary wo|men, who were in the van of the attack, and &s;tood in the pa&s;&s;ages of the convention armed with poni|ards, which they pointed at the bo&s;oms of &s;uch of the deputies as attempted to leave the hall, had gone too far to recede. The fir&s;t of June they employ|ed in preparations for a fre&s;h attack; and on the &s;e|cond again the toc&s;in rung, again the whole city was under arms, and the convention was again in|ve&s;ted by &s;ixty thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>It does not appear that all the adherents of the con&s;pirators, or rather the different factions in league with them, were acquainted with all the means which Robe&s;pierre, Marat, and the munici|pality, the original authors of the plot, meant to employ. La Croix, a member of the mountain, who had been repul&s;ed in endeavouring to go out of the hall, prote&s;ted with vehemence again&s;t this vio|lation of their liberties; and when Henriot, in re|ceiving orders from the pre&s;ident to draw off his troops, replied, that as &s;oon as he had executed the orders of the people he would obey tho&s;e of the con|vention, and threatened that if they refu&s;ed to deli|ver up to ju&s;tice the twenty-two deputies whom he called traitors, he would order the cannon to be &s;ired on the hall; Danton with great indignation imprecated vengeance on the head of the ruffian, which &s;ome months after, at the period of his own fall, was in the act of accu&s;ation alleged again&s;t him as a crime. In vain did the convention, partaking Danton's indignation, hope to obtain their li|berty by decreeing that the officers of the po&s;t next the entrance of the hall &s;hould be called to the bar.

Two of them had received no orders, and a third informed them that he was him&s;elf con&s;igned by a few &s;trangers who did not appear to him acquainted even with military forms. The&s;e &s;trangers were ordered to the bar; but they refu&s;ed to attend: and thus this a&s;&s;embly, which talked of nothing le&s;s than bringing princes and kings in chains to their feet, were made pri&s;oners in their very &s;anctuary by a few hirelings, of whom no other de&s;cription was given than that they were &s;trangers and wore mu&s;taches. This was an indignity not to be borne. The pre|&s;ident, therefore, propo&s;ed that the a&s;&s;embly in a body &s;hould go out of the hall: this was decreed, and the &s;entinels &s;eeing them&s;elves likely to be over|powered gave way. The deputies paraded in the garden, expecting every moment to be ma&s;&s;acred; but the con&s;pirators who directed their motions led them back again to the hall, ob&s;erving that the con|vention, after &s;o &s;triking a proof, could have no doubt of their being at liberty.</P>
<P>Previou&s;ly to this mock parade, Barrere, who had been weighing the probabilities of &s;ucce&s;s on either &s;ide, and examining which party would have the a&s;cendency, at length invited the pro&s;cribed de|puties, for the &s;ake of peace and for the good of the &s;tate, to &s;ubmit, and devote them&s;elves to their country. To this admonition three of them ac|ceded; but Barbaroux a&s;&s;erted, that he had no right to give in his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, nor could he obey any other mandate than that of the people, who having in|ve&s;ted him with the power had alone the right to take it from him. With more vehemence Lanjui|nais exclaimed, that he would remain at his po&s;t to his late&s;t breath, or till he was torn from it by force. His intrepidity provoked the con&s;pirators to rage and tumult. "Citizens," &s;aid he, "we have beheld in barbarous countries the people leading hu|man

This courageous reply to their fury appalled the ty|rants; and had Vergniaud, Rabaut, Bri&s;&s;ot, and others who&s;e names were in the con&s;pirators' li&s;t, been then at their po&s;t, had they &s;econded their pro|&s;cribed colleagues at this critical moment with the thunder of their eloquence, the project of the con|&s;pirators might ea&s;ily have been defeated, and they might have &s;aved both them&s;elves and the republic. While the con&s;pirators were perpetrating this abo|minable deed, they were deliberating in the hou&s;e of Gaudet about the means that &s;hould be taken to avoid it, and deceived by a report which a friend unhappily ill-informed conveyed to them, that the blood of their colleagues was flowing; and believ|ing it to be too late to make any further &s;truggle, they &s;uffered the decree of arre&s;tation to be carried without oppo&s;ition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Louvet relates the following &s;ingular anecdote: "We began to breathe again, when a man of Bourdeaux, who had been made pri&s;oner at the battle of Nerwinden, and afterwards exchanged, related to Gaudet, his friend, that having had an opportunity of forming an intimate acquaintance with one of the officers of the Imperial army, he had learned from him that Cobourg's &s;taff-of|ficers flattered them&s;elves that in a &s;hort &s;pace of time <HI>twenty-two beads</HI> would fall in the convention.

Had the convention, when Henriot &s;ent them his mandate, ordered him to be in&s;tantly put to death, their orders, if they could have been promulgated out of the precincts of the hall, would undoubtedly have been obeyed; but the con&s;pirators had taken mea&s;ures to prevent any &s;uch tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion, by con|&s;igning every officer to his po&s;t, by filling up every avenue with their agents, who had received orders to &s;uffer no communication between the hall and the court or garden, and al&s;o by clo&s;ing the gates of the latter, &s;o that the people in general knew no|thing of what was pa&s;&s;ing.</P>

<P>The tidings of the in&s;urrection in Paris occa|&s;ioned much fermentation in the departments, who were expected to have demanded of the Pari&s;ians, in a manner more &s;erious than by addre&s;s or re|mon&s;trance, why the repre&s;entatives whom they
<PB N="46" REF="031634_0045_0FED6207006E2B20">
had committed to their re&s;pect and protection were retained as pri&s;oners and regarded as traitors. The Pari&s;ians, who had been altogether pa&s;&s;ive during this &s;truggle, were not much moved by the&s;e me|naces. They had beheld with indifference the pro|gre&s;s of the conte&s;t. Finding them&s;elves delivered from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the former government; concluding that no tyrant exi&s;ted except &s;uch as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore the name of king; and per&s;uaded that that &s;y&s;tem could never return, they were carele&s;s whe|ther the plain or the mountain, the c&ocirc;t&eacute; droit or c&ocirc;t&eacute; gauche held the reins of government. This fatal error has been the &s;ource of almo&s;t all the evils that have de&s;olated the republic; for had the Pari|&s;ians attended to the political duties that were re|quired of them in exchange for their enjoyment of political rights, they would never have &s;een their fellow-citizens dragged daily through their &s;treets to the &s;caffold, at the nod of tyrants whom they ought early to have cru&s;hed.</P>
<P>During the progre&s;s of this con&s;piracy, the a&s;|&s;emblies of the &s;ections where the citizens met to deliberate on public affairs, were either filled by the agents of the con&s;pirators, or governed by the con&s;pirators them&s;elves; and where neither of them had weight &s;ufficient to mi&s;lead the citizens, they took advantage of their departure to propo&s;e and carry re&s;olutions among them&s;elves, which they proclaimed as the voice of the &s;ection. Though the&s;e practices were denounced in the convention, and though &s;ometimes the &s;ection of to-day came to di&s;claim what the &s;ame &s;ection of ye&s;terday had &s;aid, yet the di&s;covery of the fraud had no tendency to awaken the citizens to greater vigilance. Had they known to what end all the artifices of the con|&s;pirators tended, they would undoubtedly have been on their guard; but as they were made to &s;erve the
<PB N="47" REF="031634_0046_0FED616BE3B649C8">
views of the traitors in demanding the expul&s;ion of their repre&s;entatives, without believing that they had committed any crime; &s;o they were al&s;o made the in&s;truments of con&s;ummating the trea&s;on by a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the violation of the repre&s;entation it&s;elf in the arbitrary arre&s;t of the deputies, without knowing for what rea&s;on they were armed and a&s;|&s;embled. A long and mournful experience has at length &s;hewn them, that it is not &s;ufficient to feel the love of liberty without making continual ef|forts to pre&s;erve it; that &s;o many and various are the enemies which it has to combat before its reign can be permanently e&s;tabli&s;hed, that as much vigi|lance is required to guard it from the inroads of the a&s;piring demagogue, as courage to &s;hake off the yoke of de&s;poti&s;m; and that when the &s;acred code of freedom is violated in one point it leads to the de&s;truction of the whole. When the nobles whom the law had confounded in the cla&s;s of citizens were per&s;ecuted as a <HI>ca&s;t,</HI> when men of &s;uperior abilities became pro&s;cribed for "ari&s;tocracy of talents," tho&s;e who were di&s;tingui&s;hed for neither deceived them&s;elves in believing they were &s;afe.</P>
<P>Although the citizens remained unmoved at the&s;e violations, a con&s;iderable number of the depart|ments felt the indignity, and prepared to avenge the national honour. Some made eloquent remon|&s;trances at the bar of the convention; &s;ome deli|berated on the convocation of the primary a&s;&s;em|blies; &s;ome propo&s;ed &s;ending no farther contribu|tions to Paris, while others took arms to &s;uppre&s;s the rebellion of the commune again&s;t the republic. For &s;ome time the arrival of the departmental force was expected; but the con&s;pirators, who fore&s;aw this formidable oppo&s;ition to the accompli&s;hment of their de&s;igns, had the prudence to provide again&s;t it by &s;ending previou&s;ly into the departments as

many of their emi&s;&s;aries as they could &s;pare with|out weakening their force at home, taken partly from among their accomplices in the convention, who carried with them the importance of repre&s;en|tatives of the people.</P>
<P>The con&s;pirators had al&s;o the advantage of being inve&s;ted with the authority of government, as they had &s;eized on the machine. They had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the convention, who were compelled to follow the impul&s;e already given them; they were propri|etors of the national wealth, and had the armies at their command. The departments, on the con|trary, had no central point of union except the common indignation which the conduct of the con&s;pirators had excited. They had no trea&s;ure at their di&s;po&s;al but what aro&s;e from voluntary contri|butions; and while they were deliberating what &s;teps they &s;hould pur&s;ue, the con&s;pirators, clothed with the national power which they had u&s;urped, reduced the departments to the &s;ame &s;tate of &s;ub|jection as they had the convention and Paris. In the we&s;tern departments, where &s;ome of the depu|ties who were accu&s;ed had fled, and around whom the people had crowded partaking their indignation, the armies that had ha&s;tily a&s;&s;embled as &s;uddenly di&s;appeared; and the whole of the republic except the city of Lyons &s;ubmitted to the yoke. The cau&s;es of this defection, which have hitherto been involved in ob&s;curity, it being the intere&s;t of the con&s;pirators to keep them concealed from the world, have lately been developed by one of the principal actors in tho&s;e memorable &s;cenes, Louvet, deputy of the department of the Loiret, who di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf early in the convention by his accu&s;ation of Robe&s;pierre, who unma&s;ked the con&s;piracy of the 10th of March, and who o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the 31&s;t of May was honourably pro&s;cribed, but is now re&s;tored to his

friends and his country. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe his own words:</P>
<P>"Gaudet and my&s;elf reached Caen on the 26th of June. On the fifth of the &s;ame month eight departments, namely, five of the former provinces of Brittany and three of Normandy, had entered into a common league. They had ju&s;t &s;ent their commi&s;&s;aries to Caen, and their troops were at the point of arriving. Wimpfen the general of the whole force, had hitherto confined all his exploits to travelling about and talking, and under the mo&s;t frivolous pretences delayed every kind of organi&s;a|tion. As &s;oon as I &s;aw him I was convinced that he was a determined royali&s;t, for he took no pains to conceal it. I a&s;ked Barbaroux and Buzot what they could expect from &s;uch a man, for the &s;upport of our cau&s;e. One of them an&s;wered me, that Wimpfen was a man of honour, and incapable of breaking his engagements, and the other was al|together captivated by his agreeable manners. Gaudet and Pethion, who had ju&s;t arrived, did not feel my apprehen&s;ions. They were a&s;toni&s;hed at my readine&s;s in &s;u&s;pecting every one that was not as much a republican as my&s;elf. From that time I &s;aw that every thing was going the &s;ame way at Caen as it had done at Paris. Wimpfen was be|loved by the Normans; he had a con&s;iderable party among the admini&s;trators of Calvados, and had gained the confidence of the Bretons. In order to take the command from him, it was nece&s;&s;ary to unite and make u&s;e of all our exertions; but I found my&s;elf altogether un&s;upported. Every thing therefore was likely to fail on the &s;ide of the repub|lic. Be&s;ides, many Normans, who &s;hewed the mo&s;t favourable di&s;po&s;itions towards us, becau&s;e in the credit of the news-papers they believed us to be royali&s;ts, changed their conduct in the mo&s;t
<PB N="50" REF="031634_0049_0FED61EA1E9B4420">
pointed manner when by our conver&s;ation, and particularly by our actions, they came to know us better. My fir&s;t hopes were directed therefore to|wards the &s;outh. If my wife had been at Caen, we &s;hould have gone aboard &s;ome ve&s;&s;el at Hon-fleur bound to Bourdeaux; and as it would have been very ea&s;y for us to have &s;een whether things went no better there than el&s;ewhere, we &s;hould have taken our pa&s;&s;age aboard the fir&s;t American ve&s;&s;el, and have been at this time &s;afe in Philadel|phia.</P>
<P>"Three weeks elap&s;ed, while Wimpfen did no|thing but lead to Evreux the two thou&s;and men who had come up from the different departments. In the mean time report had &s;o &s;welled this little troop, that it was &s;aid at Paris to be thirty thou&s;and &s;trong. At this period, the patriots there had re|covered from their fears, &s;poke their opinions pub|licly, and were preparing to overthrow the terri|ble municipality. Many &s;ections had already &s;ent their commi&s;&s;aries to Evreux, who had carried back to Paris different publications explanatory of our true &s;entiments, and particularly a piece which they called, but I know not for what rea&s;on, Wimp|fen's Manife&s;to, and which was a declaration of the commi&s;&s;aries of the united departments; a de|claration which I had compo&s;ed with great labour, which breathed only peace, fraternity and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Pari&s;ians, but open war and exemplary pu|ni&s;hment to &s;ome of the mountain, to the munici|pality and the cordeliers; and this ju&s;t di&s;tinction had produced the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible effect in Paris. The commi&s;&s;aries be&s;ides had &s;een and borne their te&s;ti|monies again&s;t the ba&s;e calumnies which had been uttered again&s;t this departmental army, when it was accu&s;ed of having worn the white cockade, and expre&s;&s;ed its wi&s;h for royalty. Every thing in
<PB N="51" REF="031634_0050_0FED623BA4F67E70">
&s;hort was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that if, at this moment, our arms had met but with the &s;lighte&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, the revolution would have been effected in Paris, with|out the interpo&s;ition of the departmental army; but it was not in this kind of &s;ucce&s;s that Wimpfen was intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>"The mountain under great apprehen&s;ions had at length rai&s;ed in Paris 1800 foot &s;oldiers, the bet|ter half of which were praying for our &s;ucce&s;s, and al&s;o &s;even or eight hundred ruffians as cowardly as they were thievi&s;h: this collection had ju&s;t entered Vernon. Then it was that Wimpfen talked of attacking this town; and here &s;uddenly a Mr. Puy|&s;ay, of whom we had never heard, was introduced to us by the general, as an officer full of republi|cani&s;m and knowledge. He it was whom Wimp|fen ordered to attack Vernon, and certainly he very well obeyed his &s;ecret in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>"In order to &s;urpri&s;e the enemy, he went out in open day with drums beating. He marched dur|ing the extreme heat, and then made his &s;oldiers, who had no tents, and who for the greater part had never been in a camp, pa&s;s the night in the open air. He lo&s;t the whole of the following day in at|tacking a &s;mall ca&s;tle, which he had the honour of taking. The enemy having by this time been well and duly informed of all his manoeuvres, he, in order to give them &s;till greater advantage, made his troops halt at the entrance of a wood a league di&s;tant from Vernon; placed his cannon one piece behind the other along a wall; left all his little army in the greate&s;t di&s;order; did not even place &s;entinels; and went to &s;leep at a cottage at half a league from the place. An hour after, a few hun|dred men &s;uddenly made their appearance, who &s;ur|pri&s;ed our men and fired three rounds of grape &s;hot; but the guns in all probability were charged only
<PB N="52" REF="031634_0051_0FED6160E2C50BF8">
with powder, for there is no doubt that it was but a farce well arranged. However that may be, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ont took place immediately among the &s;oldiers, who did not know with what numbers they had to engage, who could &s;carcely find their arms, and who were looking about in vain for their com|mander. This was &s;o expeditious a retreat, that, had it not been for the brave &s;oldiers of the de|partment of the I&s;le and Vilain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, who &s;tood their ground for &s;ome little time, not a &s;ingle field-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would have been &s;aved. In &s;hort, not a man re|ceived the &s;lighte&s;t wound: the enemy did not ad|vance thirty &s;teps to follow up their ea&s;y victory. This adventure did not hinder Mr. Puy&s;ay, whom the admini&s;tration of the department of the Eure entreated not to abandon them, from declaring that Evreux was not tenable; and in reality the next day he withdrew him&s;elf &s;ixteen leagues, without &s;triking a blow, and abandoned a whole depart|ment to the enemy.</P>
<P>"On the arrival of the courier who brought us the&s;e &s;ad tidings, Wimpfen did not appear at all di&s;concerted. He moreover a&s;&s;ured us that there was nothing unfortunate in this event: he talked of fortifying Caen, of declaring the city in a &s;tate of defence, of organizing an army &s;omewhat &s;tronger, and of making paper-money which &s;hould be current throughout the &s;even united depart|ments.</P>
<P>"The&s;e ob&s;ervations afforded room for deep re|flection. Salles and my&s;elf, after having a long time conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject, were convinced that the general, &s;o far from wi&s;hing to march to Paris, intended to keep us &s;hut up with him in the city, where his party was prevalent, to e&s;tabli&s;h a com|munication with England, and to commit us with that power if it were po&s;&s;ible; in fine, to make u&s;e

of us according to circum&s;tances, either to make his peace with the mountain if the coalition of the &s;outhern departments &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved, or make his peace with the republicans if they &s;hould over|throw the mountain. Our colleagues, to whom we communicated our &s;u&s;picions, thought us vi&s;i|onaries, and nothing le&s;s was nece&s;&s;ary to convince them than what happened &s;oon after.</P>

He began by de&s;cribing to us our &s;ituations as very critical, unle&s;s we took &s;ome vigorous re&s;olution. He was going to Li|&s;ieux to organi&s;e his army, and to form his camp in &s;uch a manner as to make at lea&s;t for &s;ome time a proper defence. The future, however, required &s;omething more permanent. He returned back to his projects re&s;pecting Caen, to his propo&s;als about the creation of paper-money, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and as he judged it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport his rea&s;oning by terror, though he ought to have known that &s;uch a mode of proceeding would have little influence on men accu&s;tomed to brave daily the fury and the murders of the mountain, an officer, who un|doubtedly had been in&s;tructed, &s;uddenly entered, and with a frightened look informed the general that there was a riot; that the people had arre&s;ted the convoys going to the army; and that they were making violent motions again&s;t the deputies. Wimp|fen affected to be angry at the precipitation with which he told him this alarming news. It is no|thing, &s;aid he to the officer; go and talk calmly to the people, make them ea&s;y; give them a little money, if it be nece&s;&s;ary. When this man left us, the general thought he might venture to make the great propo&s;ition. Reflect maturely on all that I have &s;aid, re&s;umed he: in order to execute great

projects we mu&s;t employ great means. But &s;tay, I am going to &s;peak plainly: I &s;ee only one po&s;&s;ible mode of providing our&s;elves with men, arms, am|munition, money, and help of every kind; <HI>that is, to negociate with England; and I my&s;elf have the means provided, but I mu&s;t have your authority, your en|gagement.</HI></P>
<P>"The reader may be a&s;&s;ured that I have a per|fect recollection of the lines I have written in Ita|li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and I can al&s;o a&s;&s;ure him that I have &s;tated truly the &s;cene of the preceding pa&s;&s;age. It is dif|ficult to paint the effect which the&s;e words produ|ced on my too confiding friends. All of them at the &s;ame moment, &s;truck with indignation, with|out any previous con&s;ultation ro&s;e up. The con|ference was in&s;tantly interrupted, though the gene|ral tried every means of renewing it.</P>
<P>"Wimpfen, &s;omewhat di&s;concerted, left us without &s;eeming to feel any re&s;entment. He only repeated to us that he was going to Li&s;ieux, and in&s;inuated, that in order to re&s;train &s;ome malevo|lent people who were endeavouring in Caen to ren|der us unpopular, we &s;hould all do better to remain in that place. I think that every per&s;on mu&s;t per|ceive the infamous &s;nare into which this worthy al|ly of the mountain wi&s;hed to draw us. Had fear or the de&s;ire of vengeance prompted us to accede to this propo&s;ition, the republic would have been lo&s;t as well as our honour. The mountain would have had victorious proofs again&s;t us. It would have been they who were republicans, we that were royali&s;ts; and all the republicans per&s;ecuted for be|ing royali&s;ts, would have been arre&s;ted, impri|&s;oned and guillotined. Our con&s;piracy, they would have &s;aid, extended to the &s;outh. It would have been we, and not them&s;elves, who delivered Tou|lon to the Engli&s;h. I know, indeed, that after

<P>"The next day Barbaroux and my&s;elf went to Li&s;ieux. The general was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee us, but he did not receive us with le&s;s courte|&s;y. We learned, what he him&s;elf took care not to inform us, that he had ju&s;t had a &s;ecret conference with one of the agents of the chiefs of the moun|tain, who for three weeks pa&s;t were throwing away handfuls of a&s;&s;ignats at Evreux, and every where on their pa&s;&s;age; and who, &s;oon after, probably &s;ure of powerful &s;upport, came with the intention of continuing the &s;ame plan of corruption at Caen, even under our eyes. We found at Li&s;ieux many people in arms, but no &s;oldiers, no organization, no di&s;cipline, and the rage of making motions. A &s;ecret hand in a &s;ingle day di&s;organized even the <HI>Breton</HI> battalions which had hitherto been firmly united. The general was at pains to make us ob|&s;erve this di&s;order, and to lead us to conclude from thence that he could not maintain his po&s;ition there, but that he mu&s;t march back with all his troops to Caen, and make this city the central point of re&s;i&s;tance, &amp;c. He neverthele&s;s avoided repeating to us his Engli&s;h prepo&s;itions. Accord|ingly the retreat took place the following day: all my friends then acknowledged that our affairs were ruined in the we&s;tern departments. In vain did the general, after having gone back to Caen, where he was always de&s;irous of e&s;tabli&s;hing him&s;elf, &s;hew di&s;po&s;itions for a &s;erious defence. In vain did he create &s;taff officers, arrange his troops, em|ploy him&s;elf in &s;earching for a convenient &s;ituation

for encampment, e&s;tabli&s;h batteries of eighteen-pounders; all this parade no longer impo&s;ed on our colleagues.</P>
<P>"It appears clear, that Wimpfen, the evening before, had given notice by one of the couriers of the committee of public &s;afety, to the mountain; and I hope that I am under&s;tood, when I &s;ay the mountain, that is not of the whole body, nor even all its leaders, that I &s;peak, but the princi|pal <HI>cordelier</HI> of the mountain, &s;uch as La Croix, Fabre d'Eglantine, and, who were equally de|ceiving and &s;hifting between the republicans, Pe|thion, Guadet, &amp;c. and the dictator Robe&s;pierre&mdash;that Wimpfen had given information of the bad &s;ucce&s;s of his Engli&s;h overtures, and that it was u&s;ele&s;s to renew the propo&s;ition. It al&s;o appears that the mountain then determined to di&s;per&s;e our little band, but without neglecting to throw on our party that colouring of royali&s;m which was &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary to effect our ruin; and it was without doubt at this period only that they determined to deliver, at lea&s;t to all appearance, Toulon to the Engli&s;h. What I am now &s;aying will po&s;&s;ibly a&s;toni&s;h every one who is not well informed as to this bu&s;ine&s;s; but when the proper time &s;hall come, I will explain my&s;elf fully with re&s;pect to this terrible farce of Toulon.</P>
<P>"It is thought that Wimpfen had a &s;afe-con|duct from the mountain, and a ready opportunity of going into England; but I know not what be|came of Mr. Puy&s;ay, who &s;uffered him&s;elf to be &s;o complai&s;antly beaten at Vernon. The admini&s;tra|tors of Calvados had given notice to the admini|&s;tration of their &s;hameful defection. They had &s;ecretly made their peace with the mountain, with|out giving us any information. The third day on|ly they made it known to us; and the method

they took was to &s;end and po&s;t up at the gate of the <HI>intendance,</HI> where we lodged, the mountain pla|card, in which was the decree of our being out of the law."</P>
<P>The counterpart of the &s;cene acted at Paris, be|tween the con&s;pirators and the convention, was attempted at Lyons, and the &s;ame day was appoint|ed in both cities for the accompli&s;hment of their purpo&s;e. At the head of this provincial con&s;piracy was a man named Chalier, a Piedmonte&s;e by birth (for mo&s;t of the agents of the con&s;pirators were foreigners) and a &s;harper by profe&s;&s;ion, having fled his own country on account of having committed fraudulent bankruptcies. He was &s;ent to Lyons by the commune of Paris, after the ma&s;&s;acre of September, and opened his mi&s;&s;ion by the murder of nine per&s;ons who had been committed to pri&s;on by the municipality of Lyons for &s;light offences. Agreeably to the in&s;tructions he had received, and in conformity to the general plan which the com|mune of Paris and the con&s;pirators had formed, their apo&s;tle laboured ince&s;&s;antly to propagate the doctrines of robbery, rebellion and murder. See|ing that the&s;e exhortations had been attended with their due effects in Paris, "the needy villain's ge|neral home," where the promi&s;e of riches without labour had allured all the idle and profligate to the &s;tandard of the con&s;pirators, he was di&s;appointed that more pro&s;elytes to this &s;educing &s;y&s;tem had not honoured his emba&s;&s;y at Lyons, where &s;ociety was le&s;s di&s;united, and where indu&s;try had e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;uper&s;titious regard to property, altogether in|compatible with Chalier's &s;y&s;tem of reform. A few, however, he found who li&s;tened to his pro|jects, and to tho&s;e he communicated his plan of re|generation, which con&s;i&s;ted in placing a guillotine the following day on one of the bridges, where all
<PB N="58" REF="031634_0057_0FED615A56B6A6C8">
the capital merchants, who were nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;to|crats, were to be executed, and their bodies thrown into the Rhone. Though this &s;ecret was imparted under the &s;olemnity of an oath, yet there were &s;ome who touched with remor&s;e gave private notice of it to the citizens, who took mea&s;ures to prevent its execution.</P>
<P>Chalier, who ought in&s;tantly to have been put to death by the ju&s;t indignation of the people, was &s;uffered to continue his revolutionary projects, to the great annoyance of the wealthy citizens, again&s;t whom his attacks were continually directed. By per&s;everance he had at length formed a &s;et out of the profligate which are to be found in all large communities, and with their aid he was encourag|ed to attempt once more the accompli&s;hment of his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>He had been appointed procurer of the com|mune; and as the municipality were compo&s;ed of Jacobins, and of others as weak as tho&s;e were wicked, Chalier, &s;upported by the faction of Paris, became its principal director. Knowing the pro|gre&s;s of the con&s;piracy in that city, he prepared his friends for the &s;ame events at Lyons, by declaring openly in the popular &s;ociety on the 27th of May, that the pre&s;idents and &s;ecretaries of the &s;ections, together with the rich <HI>egoti&s;ts,</HI> &s;hould be beheaded on the following day. The municipality on the 26th, influenced by Chalier, had levied a revolu|tionary tax of &s;ix millions of livres on the rich, to be paid in twenty-four hours. This municipal le|vy excited murmurs as was expected, and gave the anarchi&s;ts pretences for rai&s;ing tumults. The rich were de&s;tined to be the victims, and Chalier's band prepared them&s;elves to be the executioners. But the Lyonnais might have cru&s;hed this in&s;urrection in its birth, had not the narrow &s;pirit of traffic,
<PB N="59" REF="031634_0058_0FED61416E9435A8">
which &s;ees nothing beneficial in &s;ociety except the accumulation of wealth, made them feel that their country was but a &s;econdary object, and fitted on|ly to employ the attention of tho&s;e who&s;e time was of le&s;s mercantile profit than their own.</P>
<P>Appri&s;ed of the intentions of the con&s;pirators, who had made out the li&s;t of the pro&s;criptions, and arranged the plan of the ma&s;&s;acre, the citizens flew to arms, and &s;eized on the ar&s;enal. The con&s;pira|tors kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town-hall, and both par|ties prepared for action; for Lyons now con&s;i&s;ted only of tho&s;e who intended to murder, and tho&s;e who did not like to be murdered. The combat was vigorou&s;ly &s;upported on both &s;ides; for the con&s;pirators were aided by a party of military whom they had previou&s;ly engaged in their intere&s;ts. Vic|tory remained doubtful for a long time, as the bat|tle was fought in the &s;treets of the city, one quarter being in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the con&s;pirators, while the republicans were ma&s;ters of the other. It was not till midnight that the citizens took the town-hall, which was the head quarters of Chalier's party. This event decided the conte&s;t, which had been &s;evere and bloody. The con&s;pirators were im|pri&s;oned, and their chief, after a long and formal trial, was condemned by the tribunal to death. Had the &s;ame re&s;i&s;tance been made to oppre&s;&s;ion in other communes, that of Paris would have been compel|led to &s;ubmit to the general will; but as the depart|ments had declined the conte&s;t, Lyons was left to with&s;tand alone all the re&s;entment of the con&s;pira|tors, and was be&s;ieged a few weeks after this period.</P>

<P>THE chief point of accu&s;ation again&s;t the depu|ties who were arre&s;ted on the &s;econd of June, was the continual oppo&s;ition which they were accu&s;ed of having made to the formation of a republican con|&s;titution. This calumny was contradicted by the fact; the pro&s;cribed deputies having, after the la|bour of &s;ome months, pre&s;ented a plan of con&s;titu|tion to the convention, which had been publi&s;hed by its order; but of which it was a part of the con&s;pirators' plan to interrupt and prevent the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As many believed that a con&s;titution was the re|medy for every evil, moral and political, and even phy&s;ical, that afflicted the &s;tate; and that, when once prepared and admini&s;tered, all its maladies would be cured; &s;ome of the departments were ap|pea&s;ed by the a&s;&s;urance that their pre&s;ent rulers would give them in a fortnight what they were made to believe their predece&s;&s;ors had &s;o long with|held.</P>
<P>The appearance of this con&s;titution within the appointed time tended greatly to allay the di&s;con|tents, and gave an air of popularity to the proceed|ings of the con&s;pirators; for, as long as the people obtained the ble&s;&s;ing, they were indifferent from what hand they received it. They were little aware of the purpo&s;es of their tyrants, who only giving them one &s;hort glimp&s;e of this wi&s;hed-for con&s;titu|tion, and having obtained their &s;anction of it, threw it a&s;ide, locked up this hallowed book of the law, &s;hrowded with a dark veil the tables of the rights of man, and boldly proclaimed a new-invented &s;pecies
<PB N="61" REF="031634_0060_0FED623E6C975C08">
of tyranny, under the denomination of revolutionary government. That epithet has &s;ince ju&s;tified every enormity, warranted the violation of every princi|ple: and theft and pillag&egrave;, noyades and fu&s;ilades have all received the common appellation of revolu|tionary mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>What contributed al&s;o to di&s;&s;ipate the &s;torm that was going to be poured on Paris, was the dread which the departments them&s;elves had of extending the civil war, which then raged in the country &s;outh of the Loire, when there was a po&s;&s;ibility of at|taining by milder means the objects they had in view, the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of their repre&s;entatives, and confining the extravagant power of the com|mune of Paris within its ju&s;t bounds. What al&s;o mi&s;led them was, the &s;ubjection to which Paris it&s;elf was reduced, and which, deceived by addre&s;|&s;es from the convention and the commune, they mi&s;took for the enjoyment of tranquillity; and what fini&s;hed the conte&s;t was the thunder of the con&s;pira|tors hurled again&s;t the departments which had &s;hewn mo&s;t zeal in favour of the impri&s;oned deputies, the con&s;tituted powers of which were di&s;&s;olved by the convention, and its members declared guilty of acts of rebellion. It was fortunate for the u&s;urpers, that this almo&s;t general and &s;peedy acquie&s;cence took place; as, independently of the coale&s;ced pow|ers, they had a mo&s;t formidable enemy to contend with in the royali&s;ts of the Vend&eacute;e, who, while the&s;e &s;truggles for power convul&s;ed Paris, were or|ganizing a force that, but for the invincible &s;pirit of liberty that in&s;pired the immen&s;e majority of the re|public, was calculated to overwhelm every contend|ing party, and bring back the ancient de&s;poti&s;m with all the avenging terrors of &s;acerdotal and ari&s;tocra|tical rage.</P>

The country which was the &s;cene of this in&s;urrec|tion in favour of prie&s;thood and royalty, is &s;ituated between the Loire and the Charente, &s;tretching along the coa&s;ts between the two rivers, and making part of the territory which was called, under the ancient government, the Province of Poi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. It is a country fertile both in corn and pa&s;ture; and from its rich abundance di&s;tributed plenty to mo&s;t of the neighbouring departments, and furni&s;hed even to the centre of France a con&s;iderable part of its &s;up|plies. Where nature had done &s;o much to make this region the &s;eat of plenty, the inhabitant was not &s;olicitous to increa&s;e his riches by foreign traffic; &s;o that commerce contributed but little to his opu|lence, and manufacturers were almo&s;t unknown. However innocent and pa&s;toral the life of a &s;hep|herd and the hu&s;bandman has been repre&s;ented, and however productive of tho&s;e vices that corrupt and enervate mankind the commercial intercour&s;e be|tween nations may have been found; this commu|nication brings with it an interchange of knowledge and manners which improves and embelli&s;hes &s;oci|ety, while the permanent habitudes of the former &s;erve to retain him in a &s;tate which adds nothing to the common &s;tock of knowledge, and contributes nothing to the progre&s;&s;ive improvement of the world. The negative merit of exemption from vices to which we have never been tempted, may be grant|ed to this intellectual darkne&s;s, where it is placed beyond the reach of endangering more enlightened &s;ociety; but when ignorance becomes the &s;port of fanatici&s;m, and ambitious men make it the in&s;tru|ment of their guilty de&s;igns, it becomes a calamity the mo&s;t terrible in the li&s;t of human evils.</P>
<P>The department of the Vend&eacute;e, from its local &s;ituation, had little other intercour&s;e with the re&s;t of the republic than what aro&s;e from the export of the
<PB N="63" REF="031634_0062_0FED61E75EBCB2B8">
&s;uperfluity of its produce; and while the great and immortal principles which directed the revolution awakened in the bo&s;om of every mechanic and pea|&s;ant throughout France the noble &s;entiment that no man was &s;uperior to him in his rights, the Vend&eacute;an, who had only heard of the&s;e things through the organ of the noble and the prie&s;t, remained the implicit believer and obedient va&s;&s;al, while his fellow-citi|zens were rejoicing in their emancipation.</P>
<P>In this in&s;ulated department the feodal &s;y&s;tem had been maintained in all its rigour. The provin|cial laws of Brittany, which, from the minutene&s;s and &s;ingularity of their oppre&s;&s;ion, would be rather &s;ubjects of ridicule than abhorrence, had they not contributed &s;o much to the degradation of the human character in the tyrant who inflicted and the &s;lave who &s;uffered them, were incorporated with other laws equally barbarous, and peculiar to the country.</P>
<P>As this part of the republic, from its geogra|phical and moral &s;ituation, had received but a few faint rays of the light of that liberty which had bur&s;t forth in France; and as already the &s;eeds of di&s;cord had been plentifully &s;cattered among the inhabitants by the fanatical clergy, it was fitted to become the retreat of all who were aver&s;e to the new order of public affairs. Accordingly the nobles and the prie&s;ts, who, in the fir&s;t meetings of the con&s;titu|ent a&s;&s;embly, di&s;covered, that by the removal of tho&s;e factious barriers by which they had hitherto been &s;eparated from the other cla&s;&s;es of the people, they were now to mingle in the common ma&s;s, found refuge in the&s;e departments, where they tru&s;t|ed that tho&s;e di&s;tinctions might &s;till be re&s;pected which had el&s;ewhere &s;unk into contempt. Their influence was exten&s;ive; and as their zeal was quickened by implacable re&s;entment, tho&s;e laws of which they could not hinder the promulgation, and
<PB N="64" REF="031634_0063_0FED61A324384338">
particularly tho&s;e which re&s;pected their own orders, were but imperfectly executed, or apparently obey|ed. Having found that that enthu&s;ia&s;im which led the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly to overthrow the&s;e gigantic pri|vileges, had con&s;iderably evaporated towards its clo&s;e; and &s;eeing al&s;o that the court, in &s;truggling to regain its lo&s;t power, &s;ought their alliance; they grew bolder in their preten&s;ions, and became more active in their hatred towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the new government. At fir&s;t an air of general di&s;content over&s;pread this part of the country&mdash;par|tial fermentations next &s;ucceeded, and the &s;pirit of in&s;urrection at length became &s;o general, that the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly was compelled to take mea&s;ures to &s;top its alarming progre&s;s.</P>
<P>The means employed by the legi&s;lature were cal|culated rather to increa&s;e than prevent the evil; for, in&s;tead of &s;ending commi&s;&s;aries from their own bo|dy to examine into its cau&s;es; in&s;tead of enlighten|ing the people, and unma&s;king and puni&s;hing tho&s;e who had prompted them to rebellion; they entru&s;t|ed the court with the execution of their decrees, and, as it might have been expected, the in&s;urrection obtained additional force, and even a &s;ort of royal &s;anction.</P>
<P>The authority of the next a&s;&s;embly was in&s;uffici|ent to repre&s;s &s;o alarming an evil. Too much di|vided by the &s;pirit of party, and too much occupied in &s;truggles again&s;t the court, the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;em|bly for a long time applied only palliatives to the di&s;ea&s;e; nor, till it wore an a&s;pect dangerous to the exi&s;tence of the revolution, was the a&s;&s;embly rou&s;ed to the application of any effective remedy. The mea&s;ure they fir&s;t propo&s;ed was the bani&s;hment of the prie&s;ts who had refu&s;ed adherence to the new con&s;titution; but this mea&s;ure appeared &s;o alarming to the court, and &s;o de&s;tructive of the &s;y&s;tem it had
<PB N="65" REF="031634_0064_0FED61579A877548">
adopted to regain its lo&s;t influence, that the king was advi&s;ed to make u&s;e of the repre&s;&s;ive power which the con&s;titution gave him, and to refu&s;e his royal &s;anction. Though this refu&s;al ha&s;tened the de&s;truction of the court, already tottering, it gave new courage to the di&s;contended, who, finding them&s;elves &s;o zealou&s;ly &s;upported, bur&s;t into open re&s;i&s;tance in the Vend&eacute;e and the neighbouring de|partments, which it required all the exertion of the departmental force to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>The fall of the court &s;u&s;pended for a time the pro|gre&s;s of this in&s;urrection; but the unhappy au|&s;pices under which the convention met, in&s;pired fre&s;h ardour, and led the in&s;urgents to new exertions. In hopes of re&s;toring the monarchy, a va&s;t plan of in&s;urrection was formed, which not only compre|hended the Vend&eacute;e and the adjoining departments, but extended it&s;elf through a great part of Brittany. The convention was too much occupied in re&s;i&s;ting the con&s;pirators at Paris to attend to the progre&s;s of the royali&s;ts, who were &s;uffered to take uninterrupt|ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Vend&eacute;e and the neighbouring departments. Before the end of March they had organized an army of 40,000 men, con&s;i&s;ting chief|ly of pea&s;ants, &s;ervants of the former nobility, &s;mug|glers, poachers and game-keepers, men well ac|cu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of arms, and had began their march towards Paris before the convention were formally advi&s;ed that any in&s;urrection had taken place. Their army was commanded by experien|ced chiefs who had &s;erved under the ancient govern|ment: but what gave the rebellion its fierce&s;t rage was the fanatici&s;m which the prie&s;t in&s;pired, who marching at the head of their columns, bearing the crucifix in his hand, pointed out to his followers the road to victory or heaven. The progre&s;s which the royali&s;ts had made before any force was oppo&s;ed to

them was &s;o alarming, that at the period when the Jacobins had &s;eized upon the government at Paris, the portion of the country which the Vend&eacute;ens had &s;ubdued was &s;o exten&s;ive, that it &s;eemed doubtful of which party France was de&s;tined to be the prey. The royali&s;ts had entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Loire al|mo&s;t as far as Paris, and menaced Rochelle on the one &s;ide while they be&s;ieged Nantes on the other, and opened a pa&s;&s;age into the departments which made part of the former province of Brittany.</P>
<P>The faction at Paris did not fail to improve the events of the Vend&eacute;e to their own advantage. Pe|thion, Buzot, Rabaut St. Etienne, I&s;nard, Lanjui|nais, Barbaroux, Gaudet, Louvet and others of the pro&s;cribed deputies having made their e&s;cape, the con&s;pirators declared, in an addre&s;s to the depart|ments, that the project of the deputies who were &s;till in arre&s;tation was evidently the &s;ame as that of their colleagues, who were gone to facilitate the march of the rebels, and aid them in the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the royal power. This calumny, which was refuted by every addre&s;s received from the de|partments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, No. II.</NOTE>, formed the ba&s;is of the accu&s;ation which was framed again&s;t the Giroude; and the founders and mo&s;t &s;trenuous &s;upporters of the re|public were &s;oon after dragged to the &s;caffold as the advocates and protectors of royalty.</P>
<P>In proportion as the departments relaxed in their energy, the ferocity of the con&s;pirators increa&s;ed. An event al&s;o happened at this period, which, from the calumnies to which it gave ri&s;e, and the con&s;e|quences it produced, proved fatal to the arre&s;ted de|puties. This was the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Marat. In the fir&s;t dawn of the con&s;piracy Marat became a principal in&s;trument in the hands of the traitors,

who found him well fitted for their purpo&s;es; and being &s;aved from the puni&s;hment which u&s;ually fol|lows per&s;onal in&s;ult by the contempt which the de|formity and diminutivene&s;s of his per&s;on excited, he became the habitual retailer of all the fal&s;ehoods and calumnies which were invented by his party again&s;t every man of influence or reputation. He was the Ther&s;ites of the convention, whom no one would deign to cha&s;ti&s;e; for his extravagance made his employers often di&s;claim him as a fool, while the general &s;entiment he excited was the &s;ort of an|tipathy we feel for a loath&s;ome reptile. His politi|cal &s;entiments often varied; for he &s;ometimes ex|horted the choice of a chief, and &s;ometimes made declamations in favour of a limited monarchy; but what rendered him u&s;eful to the con&s;pirators was his readine&s;s to publi&s;h every &s;lander which they fram|ed, and to exhort to every horror which they me|ditated.&mdash;His rage for denunciation was &s;o great that he became the dupe of the idle; and his daily paper contains the names of great criminals who exi&s;ted only in the imagination of tho&s;e who impo&s;|ed on his credulous malignity.</P>
<P>After this fir&s;t preacher of blood had performed the part allotted to him in the plan of evil, he was confined to his chamber by a lingering di&s;ea&s;e to which he was &s;ubject, and of which he would pro|bably &s;oon have died. But he was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in his bath by a young woman who had travelled with this intention from Caen in Normandy. Charlotte Anne Marie Corday was a native of St. Saturnin in the department of the Orne. She appears to have lived in a &s;tate of literary retirement with her father, and by the &s;tudy of ancient and modern hi&s;|torians to have imbibed a &s;trong attachment to li|berty. She had been accu&s;tomed to a&s;&s;imilate cer|tain periods of ancient hi&s;tory with the events that
<PB N="68" REF="031634_0067_0FED61AC8C839530">
were pa&s;&s;ing before her, and was probably excited by the examples of antiquity to the commi&s;&s;ion of a deed, which &s;he believed with fond enthu&s;ia&s;m would deliver and &s;ave her country.</P>
<P>Being at Caen when the citizens of the depart|ment were enrolling them&s;elves to march to the relief of the convention, the animation with which &s;he &s;aw them devoting their lives to their country, led her to execute, without delay, the project &s;he had formed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Louvet &s;peaks of this extraordinary woman in the following terms:&mdash;"A young per&s;on came to &s;peak to Barbaroux at the Intendance where we all lodged. She was tall and well &s;haped, of the mo&s;t graceful manners and mode&s;t demeanour: there was in her countenance, which was beautiful and engaging, and in all her movements, a mixture of &s;oftne&s;s and dignity, which were evident indications of a heavenly mind. She came always attended by a &s;ervant, and waited for Barbaroux in an apartment through which we pa&s;&s;ed frequently. Since this young woman has fixed on her&s;elf the attention of the world, we have each of us recollected the circum&s;tances of her vi&s;its, of which it is now clear that &s;ome favour &s;olicited for a friend was only a pretence. Her true motive undoubtedly was to become acquainted with &s;ome of the founders of the republic, for which &s;he was going to devote her&s;elf; and perhaps &s;he was de&s;irous that at &s;ome future day her features &s;hould be brought to their recollection.</P><P>"I declare and &s;olemnly atte&s;t, that &s;he never communicated to us a word of her de&s;ign; and if &s;uch actions could be directed, and &s;he had con&s;ulted us, would it have been again&s;t Marat that we &s;hould have pointed her &s;troke? Did we not know that he was then langui&s;hing under a fatal di&s;ea&s;e, and had but a few days to live?"</P></NOTE>. Under pretence of going home, &s;he came to Paris, and the third day after her arrival obtained admi&s;&s;ion to Marat. She had invented a &s;tory to deceive him; and when he promi&s;ed her that all the promoters of the in&s;urrection in the de|partments &s;hould be &s;ent to the guillotine, &s;he drew out a knife which &s;he had purcha&s;ed for the occa|&s;ion, and plunged it into his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>She was immediately apprehended, and conduct|ed to the Abbaye pri&s;on, from which &s;he was trans|ferred
<PB N="69" REF="031634_0068_0FED6208ACCDBDE8">
to the Conciergerie, and brought before the revolutionary tribunal.</P>
<P>She acknowledged the deed, and ju&s;tified it by a&s;&s;erting that it was a duty &s;he owed her country and mankind to rid the world of a mon&s;ter, who&s;e &s;anguinary doctrines were framed to involve the country in anarchy and civil war, and a&s;&s;erted her right to put Marat to death as a convict already condemned by the public opinion. She tru&s;ted that her example would in&s;pire the people with that energy which had been at all times the di&s;tingui&s;h|ed characteri&s;tic of republicans; and which &s;he defined to be that devotedne&s;s to our country which renders life of little comparative e&s;timation.</P>
<P>Her deportment during the trial was mode&s;t and dignified. There was &s;o engaging a &s;oftne&s;s in her countenance, that it was difficult to conceive how &s;he could have armed her&s;elf with &s;ufficient intre|pidity to execute the deed. Her an&s;wers to the in|terrogatories of the court were full of point and energy. She &s;ometimes &s;urpri&s;ed the audience by her wit, and excited their admiration by her elo|quence. Her face &s;ometimes beamed with &s;ubli|mity, and was &s;ometimes covered with &s;miles. At the clo&s;e of her trial &s;he took three letters from her bo&s;om, and pre&s;ented them to the judges, and reque&s;ted they might be forwarded to the per&s;ons to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed. Two were written to Barbaroux, in which with great ea&s;e and &s;pirit &s;he relates her adventures from her leaving Caen to the morning of her trial. The other was an af|fectionate and &s;olemn adieu to her father. She retired while the jury deliberated on their verdict; and when &s;he again entered the tribunal there was a maje&s;tic &s;olemnity in her demeanour which per|fectly became her &s;ituation. She heard her &s;en|tence with attention and compo&s;ure; and after con|ver&s;ing

<P>She had concluded her letter to her father with this ver&s;e of Corneille,

and it is difficult to conceive the kind of heroi&s;m which &s;he di&s;played in the way to execution. The women who were called furies of the guillotine, and who had a&s;&s;embled to in&s;ult her on leaving the pri&s;on, were awed into &s;ilence by her demeanour, while &s;ome of the &s;pectators uncovered their heads before her, and others gave loud tokens of applau&s;e. There was &s;uch an air of cha&s;tened exultation thrown over her countenence, that &s;he in&s;pired &s;entiments of love rather than &s;en&s;ations of pity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She excited in this intere&s;ting &s;ituation a very &s;trong and &s;ingular pa&s;&s;ion in a young man of the name of Adam Lux, a commi&s;&s;ary from Mayence. He accidentally cro&s;&s;ed the &s;treet &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing in her way to execution, and became in&s;tantly ena|moured not of her only, but, what was more extraordinary, of the guillotine.

to die with dignity. She had learned from her jailor the mode of puni&s;hment, but was not in|&s;tructed in the detail; and when the executioner attempted to tie her feet to the plank, &s;he re&s;i&s;ted, from an apprehen&s;ion that he had been ordered to in&s;ult her; but on his explaining him&s;elf &s;he &s;ub|mitted with a &s;mile.

<P>The leaders of the faction, who thought every mea&s;ure good that could be made &s;ub&s;ervient to their purpo&s;e, found this event too replete with favourable circum&s;tances to be neglected. Marat, whom they had thrown a&s;ide to die at lei&s;ure, un|le&s;s perchance he &s;hould have lived to &s;hare the fate to which they afterwards condemned their other agents, was now re&s;tored to more than his antient honours, was proclaimed a martyr, and his death ordered to be lamented as an irreparable lo&s;s to the republic. The con&s;pirators declared that no far|ther doubt of the federali&s;m of the departments remained. The death of Marat was the point of conviction. Every member of the mountain was to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in his turn, and the traitors of the departments had their accomplices in Paris who had whetted their poniards to involve the city in de&s;truction. Though the Pari&s;ians were not &s;uf|ficiently credulous to believe the&s;e calumnies, the faction made them the pretence to proceed to the farther commi&s;&s;ion of crimes; and while they en|deavoured to amu&s;e the people with what they called the inauguration of Marat and of Chalier, they were meditating the murder of the deputies whom they had driven from the legi&s;lature.</P>

A certain cla&s;s of the women of Paris, who gave them&s;elves the title of revolutionary women, had been &s;erviceable auxiliaries to the con&s;pirators, and had taken place of the poi&s;&s;ards, who not hav|ing all the energy which the pre&s;ent exigencies re|quired, had yielded the palm to their revolutionary &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. The&s;e female politicians held delibe|rative a&s;&s;emblies, and afterwards pre&s;ented their views to the convention, while they influenced its debates by their vociferations in the tribunes, which they now exclu&s;ively occupied. On the days of tumult which preceded the 31&s;t of May they had mounted guard in per&s;on at the convention, and prevented the execution of certain orders which they di&s;liked. They now pre&s;ented them&s;elves at the bar of the a&s;&s;embly, and demanded the exclu|&s;ion of the former nobles from every function civil or military, the renewal of all the admini&s;trations throughout the republic, the examination of the conduct of the mini&s;ters, the arre&s;t of every &s;u&s;|pected per&s;on, the rai&s;ing of the whole nation in a ma&s;s, and obliging the women to wear red caps.

More efficient mea&s;ures became nece&s;&s;ary than had hitherto been employed, and that which was now adopted was putting into requi&s;ition every individual that could be made u&s;eful to his country in any &s;ituation in which his &s;ervices were claimed.

<P>Whatever may be the difference of political opi|nion re&s;pecting the events of the French revolu|tion, there can be no di&s;&s;enting voice again&s;t the tribute of honour and applau&s;e which belongs to the armies of the republic.

This pa&s;&s;ion was nouri&s;hed by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that their &s;ections, their com|munes, the convention, and their country were looking on them with fond and anxious expecta|tion, and the decrees which declared that they de|&s;erved well of the republic animated them with a more ardent de&s;ire to merit the eulogium.</P>

But the great moral motive that urged them to valorous deeds, was that contempt of death which men in all ages, who combat for liberty and their country, have felt, and this was a motive which their antagoni&s;ts could not feel. The &s;oldier was con&s;cious that, if he &s;urvived, he &s;hould partake of the honour he had laboured to acquire; and if he died, that his coun|try would enroll his name among tho&s;e of its de|liverers, and that his fate would in&s;pire that &s;enti|ment which our animated poet has &s;o beautifully de&s;cribed in his ode on the glorious dead.</P>

and revolutionary citizens of each &s;ection of Paris who cho&s;en by their re&s;pective committees to com|po&s;e a body of &s;ix thou&s;and men, which was called the revolutionary army, and which, accompanied by a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A travelling guillotine.</NOTE> guillotine ambulante, was to i&s;&s;ue forth from Paris into the departments, to invite the people to rai&s;e them&s;elves to the height of the revolution.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the u&s;urpers framed an act of accu&s;ation again&s;t the deputies whom they had dri|ven from the convention on the 31&s;t of May, and arre&s;ted the &s;eventy-three members who had prote&s;t|ed again&s;t that mea&s;ure. At this period al&s;o the vague report of a &s;py, that Beauvais a deputy of the convention had been put to death by the Engli&s;h at Toulon, &s;erved as a pretext to the u&s;urpers for in|flicting twenty years impri&s;onment on whoever &s;hould introduce Engli&s;h merchandize into the re|public, and for throwing into pri&s;on and confi&s;cat|ing the property of all tho&s;e who had been born in the Briti&s;h dominions, except &s;uch as were employ|ed in manufactures. This impolitic and &s;avage de|cree, in open violation of the rights of nations, and breach of that ho&s;pitality under the protection of which but a few months before they had invited the Engli&s;h then in France to remain among them, was put into execution; and though it met with univer&s;al reprobation, yet as terror was the order of the day, no one felt him&s;elf &s;ufficiently bold to demand its repeal; and as bu&s;ine&s;s of more import|ance lay before the con&s;pirators than the con&s;idera|tion of the ca&s;es of individuals, tho&s;e who had the credulity to tru&s;t to their protection were left to ru|minate on their inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep taken by the con&s;pirators was that of throwing a&s;ide the incumbrance of the con&s;titu|tion.
<PB N="78" REF="031634_0077_0FED62401DC38D78">
A report was accordingly prepared, &s;hewing the impo&s;&s;ibility of conducting the machine of the revolution without the u&s;e of extraordinary mea|&s;ures, and the convention voted without di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, that the con&s;titution &s;hould be &s;et a&s;ide, and that the government &s;hould become revolutionary. The &s;uperiority of a monarchical over a republican go|vernment has been &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in the unity of its action, particularly in ca&s;es of danger. The Ro|mans in time of great public calamity were accu&s;|tomed to throw a veil over the tables of the laws, and place in the hands of one of their fellow-citi|zens, whom they called a Dictator, the whole ener|gy of the government, as long as the danger which threatened the &s;tate &s;hould exi&s;t. Rou&s;&s;eau admires this policy, and recommends it in &s;imilar ca&s;es to all free governments. Of whatever advantage the temporary ab&s;ence of liberty might have been, had the people of France, like the Romans, cho&s;en tho&s;e to rule the &s;torm who had the greate&s;t &s;kill or the mo&s;t acknowledged virtue; tho&s;e &s;anguinary and ferocious characters who now &s;eized on the power, in&s;tead of making this temporary de&s;poti&s;m a means of &s;aving the country, like the malevolent genii who pre&s;ide over evil, filled it with horror, de&s;olation, and death.</P>
<P>To reconcile the nation to the a&s;&s;umption of their new power, the con&s;pirators thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew their di&s;tingui&s;hing attachment to what they called the people by the exerci&s;e of every kind of per&s;ecution again&s;t what they called ari&s;tocracy, an appellation by no means confined to the adherents of the former court or the nobility. To the "ari&s;|tocracy of talents" &s;ucceeded the "ari&s;tocracy of commerce," which &s;ignified that he who enriched him&s;elf while he enriched his country by the &s;upply of its wants, was an object of &s;u&s;picion, or a coun|ter-revolutioni&s;t.
<PB N="79" REF="031634_0078_0FED620F447D5290">
They therefore conceived the pro|ject of reducing every article of merchandize and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to what they called the <HI>maximum,</HI> and obliged every merchant and &s;hop-keeper to &s;ell his goods to the public at the pre&s;cribed rate, whatever might have been the fir&s;t co&s;t. Though it was evi|dent to the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob&s;erver, that &s;uch a mea&s;ure mu&s;t be eventually de&s;tructive of commerce, and productive of the evil it was intended to prevent; yet, as it was an evil that but remotely affected the con&s;umer, it was calculated to plea&s;e the lower cla&s;s of people.</P>
<P>The faction, armed with the ab&s;olute power they had u&s;urped, fancied they could control all po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tances; and though they could not but per|ceive that the manufacturer mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily cea&s;e his labour when the new materials exceeded the &s;tat|ed price of the goods he expo&s;ed to &s;ale, and that the merchant could no longer go on with his com|merce, when the cargo which he had purcha&s;ed abroad was &s;truck with the revolutionary <HI>maximum</HI> on its entrance into port; though they could not but &s;ee that it was a law fraught with every evil, yet as it was a blow at the ari&s;tocracy of commerce, and a revolutionary mea&s;ure, it was propo&s;ed and adopted.</P>
<P>While they were thus per&s;uading the people what intere&s;t they took in their welfare by the introduc|tion of plenty, in the extinction of monopolies, and the reduction of the price of merchandize, they were equally &s;olicitous to &s;how their regard for the public &s;afety by the puni&s;hment of traitors and con|&s;pirators. For a long time the Jacobins had de|manded the trial of Maria Antoinette, who&s;e ex|i&s;tence they declared endangered that of the repub|lic. She was accordingly arraigned for having
<PB N="80" REF="031634_0079_0FED621203F9FD78">
committed a &s;eries of crimes, which in the language of the indictment comprehended not merely counter-revolutionary projects, but all the enormities of the Me&s;&s;alinas, Brunehauts, Fredegondes, and Medi|cis. A curious account of the evidence in &s;upport of the&s;e charges, and the effect which her behavi|our produced upon Robe&s;pierre, is given by Vilate, a young man of the revolutionary tribunal. The &s;cene pa&s;&s;ed during the trial, at a tavern near the Tuilleries, where he was invited to dine with Ro|be&s;pierre, Barrere, and St. Ju&s;t. "Seated around the table," he &s;ays, "in a clo&s;e and retired room, they a&s;ked me to give them &s;ome leading features of the evidence on the trial of the Au&s;trian. I did not forget that expo&s;tulation of in&s;ulted nature when, Hebert accu&s;ing Antoinette of having committed the mo&s;t &s;hocking crime, &s;he turned with dignity towards the audience, and &s;aid, "I appeal to the con&s;cience and feelings of every mother pre&s;ent, to declare if there be one among&s;t them who does not &s;hudder at the idea of &s;uch horrors." Robe&s;pierre &s;truck with this an&s;wer as by an electrical &s;troke, broke his plate with his fork. "That blockhead Hebert!" cried he, "as if it were not enough that &s;he was really a Me&s;&s;alina, he mu&s;t make her an Agrippina al&s;o, and furni&s;h her with the triumph of exciting the &s;ympathy of the public in her la&s;t mo|ments."</P>
<P>Marie Antoinette made no defence, and called no witne&s;&s;es, alleging that no po&s;itive fact had been produced again&s;t her. She had pre&s;erved an uni|form behaviour during the whole of her trial, ex|cept when a &s;tarting tear accompanied her an&s;wer to Hebert. She was condemned about four in the morning, and heard her &s;entence with compo&s;ure. But her firmne&s;s for&s;ook her in the way from the
<PB N="81" REF="031634_0080_0FED621D193D3A38">
court to her dungeon&mdash;&s;he bur&s;t into tears; when, as if a&s;hamed of this weakne&s;s, &s;he ob&s;erved to her guards, that though &s;he wept at that moment, they &s;hould &s;ee her go to the &s;caffold without &s;hedding a tear.</P>
<P>In her way to execution, where &s;he was taken af|ter the accu&s;tomed manner in a cart, with her hands tied behind her, &s;he paid little attention to the prie&s;t who attended her, and &s;till le&s;s to the &s;ur|rounding multitude. Her eyes, though bent on vacancy, did not conceal the emotion that was la|bouring at her heart&mdash;her cheeks were &s;ometimes in a &s;ingular manner &s;treaked with red, and &s;ometimes over&s;pread with deadly palene&s;s; but her general look was that of indignant &s;orrow. She reached the place of execution about noon; and when &s;he turned her eyes towards the gardens and the palace, &s;he became vi&s;ibly agitated. She a&s;cended the &s;caf|fold with precipitation, and her head was in a mo|ment held up to the people by the executioner.</P>
<P>The trial of Marie Antoinette was followed by that of the accu&s;ed deputies. Although tho&s;e guar|dians of the public weal, the Jacobins, had repeat|edly urged the convention to bring forward their trial, it had been long delayed from the difficulty of finding any proofs that wore the appearance of pro|bability; and it remained long undecided what &s;hould be the charges, and who &s;hould be the vic|tims. The &s;ub&s;tance of the accu&s;ation was at length founded on a &s;ort of &s;portive party romance written by Camille De&s;moulins on Bri&s;&s;ot and the Bri&s;&s;o|tins; and what was meant by the author merely to excite a laugh, was di&s;torted to &s;erve this hor|rible purpo&s;e. Camille, it is &s;aid, remon&s;trated loudly on this perver&s;ion of his intentions, and di&s;|claimed any participation in the guilt. He declar|ed that the charges were only extravagancies of his
<PB N="82" REF="031634_0081_0FED61B1972DB740">
own imagination, and that he could not &s;upport any of them by evidence. This remon&s;trance was inef|fectual, and the romance formed part of the indict|ment, which was filled up with charges of royali&s;m and federali&s;m; which being pre&s;ented to the a&s;&s;em|bly for their &s;anction, the decree of accu&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed without a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The witne&s;&s;es in &s;upport of the charges con&s;i&s;ted principally of the chiefs of the municipality of Paris, who were the original accu&s;ers. But the defence which the pri&s;oners made was &s;o entirely de&s;truc|tive of the accu&s;ation, that though the judges and the jury had bound up their nature to this execrable deed; though the audience, like the tribunes of the Jacobins and the convention, were hired to ap|plaud this crime, the eloquence of the accu&s;ed drew iron tears down their cheeks, and convinced the whole tribunal of the infamy and fal&s;ehood of the charges. Imagine the remor&s;e with which the minds of the jury mu&s;t have been wrung when their employment compelled them to dre&s;s out matter for condemnation from the ab&s;urd and lying fables of the con&s;pirators, who were called as witne&s;&s;es to the indictment; while, to the demon&s;tration even of the mo&s;t perver&s;e and ignorant, the pri&s;oners refut|ed every charge with triumph on their accu&s;ers; and if any &s;u&s;picion had exi&s;ted with re&s;pect to their patrioti&s;m or love of the republic, the pro&s;ecution would have &s;erved to di&s;pel it.</P>
<P>The judges, as well as the jury, although deter|mined to execute their atrocious commi&s;&s;ion, &s;aw that the defence of the pri&s;oners would carry con|viction to the minds of the audience, who, notwith|&s;tanding their being hired by the accu&s;ers, began to &s;hew &s;igns of compa&s;&s;ion. The court, there|fore, wrote to the convention to inform them, that if the trials were permitted to proceed, the forma|lities
<PB N="83" REF="031634_0082_0FED614AEC39DA88">
of the law would reduce them to extreme dif|ficulties; and ob&s;erved, that in a revolutionary pro|ce&s;s it was not nece&s;&s;ary to be incumbered with trouble&s;ome witne&s;&s;es, or a long defence. This humane epi&s;tle was &s;upported by a deputation of the Jacobins, who &s;poke a &s;till plainer language, by demanding a decree, that the accu&s;ed &s;hould be condemned whenever the jury &s;hould feel them&s;elves "&s;ufficiently in&s;tructed," without attending to the whole of the charge, or hearing what the pri&s;oners might have to allege in their defence. To this mea&s;ure the &s;ociety was urged by the municipal witne&s;&s;es, who were &s;tung with &s;hame at &s;eeing their perjuries unveiled.</P>
<P>The decree, empowering the jury to &s;top the pro&s;ecution at whatever period they thought proper, was virtually pronouncing the &s;entence of death: and the tribunal, relea&s;ing them&s;elves from the tor|ture they were compelled to &s;uffer, while their con|&s;ciences were every hour more and more loaded with the conviction of the innocence of the victims who&s;e judicial murder they were bound to perpe|trate, lo&s;t no time in declaring that they were &s;uffi|ciently in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>Alas! in what were "they &s;ufficiently in&s;truct|ed?" That the men they were going to condemn, were tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for ta|lents, and mo&s;t devoted to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the republic, of which they were the founders. Were not this &s;anguinary jury &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed, that it was for their virtues, and not their crimes, that the&s;e victims had been dragged before them? and yet, with all this conviction on their minds, they coolly commanded the murder.</P>
<P>This atrocious condemnation was remon&s;trated again&s;t by the pri&s;oners in vain. In vain they al|leged, that again&s;t &s;ome of them no evidence what|ever
<PB N="84" REF="031634_0083_0FED61F0B4724CD0">
had been heard; that their names had &s;carcely been mentioned at the tribunal; and that, what|ever pretence the jury might have for calling them|&s;elves &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed re&s;pecting the re&s;t, they could not be informed of the crimes of tho&s;e again&s;t whom no witne&s;&s;es had appeared. The court, &s;heltering them&s;elves under the &s;anction of a decree, were little inclined to give the rea&s;ons of their conviction; and therefore replied to the arguments of the pri&s;oners, by ordering the mili|tary force to take them from the tribunal. Va|laz&eacute;, in a tran&s;port of indignation, &s;tabbed him|&s;elf before the court. Bri&s;&s;ot, Vergniaud, Gen|&s;onn&eacute;, La Source, Fonfrede, Sillery, Ducos, Carra, Duperret, Gardien, Duprat, Fauchet, Beauvais, Ducha&s;tel, Mainvielle, La Caze, Le Hardy, Boi|leau, Anteboul, and Vig&eacute;e, were led to execution on the following day. Vergniaud, having a pre|&s;age of his impending fate, had early provided him&s;elf with poi&s;on; but finding that his young friends Fonfrede and Ducos, who he had &s;ome hopes would be &s;pared, were companions of his misfor|tune, he gave the phial to the officer of the guard, re&s;olving to wait the appointed moment, and to pe|ri&s;h with them.</P>
<P>They met their fate with all the calm of inno|cence, and breathed their la&s;t vows for the &s;afety and liberty of the republic. Tho&s;e who were the melancholy witne&s;&s;es of their la&s;t hours in pri&s;on, love to relate how they &s;poke, and felt, and acted. I have been told by one who was their fellow pri|&s;oner and friend, that their minds were in &s;uch a &s;tate of elevation, that no one could approach them with the common-place and ordinary topics of con|&s;olation. Bri&s;&s;ot was &s;erious and thoughtful, and at times an air of di&s;content clouded his brow; but it was evident that he mourned over the fate of
<PB N="85" REF="031634_0084_0FED61F52C2DA588">
his country and not his own. Gen&s;onn&eacute;, firm and &s;elf-collected, &s;eemed fearful of &s;ullying his lips by mentioning the names of his murderers. He did not utter a word re&s;pecting his own &s;ituation, but made many ob&s;ervations on the &s;tate of the re|public, and expre&s;&s;ed his ardent wi&s;hes for its hap|pine&s;s. Vergniaud was &s;ometimes &s;erious, and &s;ometimes gay. He amu&s;ed his fellow-pri&s;oners at times with the recital of poetry which he re|tained in his memory, and &s;ometimes indulged them with the la&s;t touches of that &s;ublime elo|quence which was now for ever lo&s;t to the world. Fonfrede and Ducos relieved the &s;ombre of the piece by the habitual liveline&s;s of their characters, although each lamented the fate of his brother to their re&s;pective friends, and &s;ometimes &s;hed tears over the di&s;tre&s;s and ruin of their wives and chil|dren; for both had young families and immen&s;e fortunes. Their courage was the more exemplary, as their fate was altogether unexpected.</P>
<P>Previou&s;ly to the impri&s;onment of the deputies, while they were yet under arre&s;t in their own hou&s;es, I frequently vi&s;ited tho&s;e who were in the number of our friends. Vergniaud had long told me that he &s;aw no ju&s;t foundation for hope, and that he would rather die, than live a witne&s;s of his country's &s;hame. Fonfrede and Ducos had the full enjoyment of their liberty till the act of accu|&s;ation appeared, in which they had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion that they &s;hould be included. The day previous to the reading of this murderous pro&s;crip|tion in the convention, Fonfrede had accompa|nied us to Montmorenci, about four leagues from Paris, where we had wandered till evening, amid&s;t that enchanting &s;cenery which Rou&s;&s;eau once in|habited, and which he had &s;o luxuriantly de&s;cribed.
<PB N="86" REF="031634_0085_0FED615F32EA39B8">
Alas! while the charms of nature had &s;oothed our imaginations, and made us forget a while the &s;cenes of moral deformity exhibited in the polluted city we had left; while every thing around us breathed delight, and the land&s;cape was a hymn to the Al|mighty; the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were at their bloody work, and plotting the murder of our friends. The next day Fonfrede was &s;ent to the Conciergerie, and we &s;aw him no more. A week after we were our|&s;elves arre&s;ted. He conveyed to us, from his dun|geon, his &s;ympathy in our misfortunes, and, after his condemnation, wrote to bid us a la&s;t farewell; but the letter was carried to the committee of gene|ral &s;afety, and never reached us.</P>
<P>They were condemned at midnight. When they returned to their pri&s;on, they gave the ap|pointed &s;ignal of their fate to their fellow-pri&s;oners, who&s;e &s;eclu&s;ion afforded them no other means of knowing it, by &s;inging a parody of the chorus of the Mar&s;ellois hymn&mdash;
<Q><L>Contre nous de la tyrannie</L>
<L>L'&eacute;tandard &s;anglant e&s;t lev&eacute;.</L></Q></P>
<P>After &s;pending the few hours of life that re|mained, in conver&s;ation, now and then enlivened by the &s;allies of the young and gay among&s;t them, they bade adieu to their fellow-pri&s;oners, who&s;e minds were &s;o rai&s;ed by the heroi&s;m which the&s;e patriots di&s;played, that it was &s;ome time before they became &s;en&s;ible of their lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The dungeon which they inhabited was &s;hewn with profound veneration to every pri&s;oner who afterwards arrived at this preparatory &s;cene of mur|der. A &s;uper&s;titious re&s;pect was paid to the mi|&s;erable matra&s;s of Vergniaud; and tho&s;e who felt neither the force of their patrioti&s;m, nor &s;hared in
<PB N="87" REF="031634_0086_0FED618EC78DCEB0">
their love for their country, were taught to pro|nounce with religious awe the names of the&s;e mar|tyrs of liberty.</P>
<P>Had the&s;e lamented patriots known all the foul|ne&s;s of the crimes which the con&s;pirators were me|ditating again&s;t them, it would have been ea&s;y to have withdrawn them&s;elves from their vengeance, as many of their pro&s;cribed colleagues did. Some, indeed, fell under the murderer's hands, but &s;ome have happily e&s;caped&mdash;Lanjuinais, I&s;nard, Louvet, and &s;ome others, appear again on the &s;cene. Bar|baroux and Buzot, I am told, are alive; and Pe|thion, who but a few months before was hailed as the &s;upport of his country, may again de&s;erve the appellation&mdash;but the re&s;t are gone for ever; and there is no one who has any ta&s;te for literature, or feeling for liberty, but will &s;igh at the remembrance of Rabaut, Guadet, and Condorcet.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Paris.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE my la&s;t letter was written, I have left Switzerland, and returned to Paris, and have had the un&s;peakable joy of embracing my family again. I have not yet mentioned to you (for till the Jacobins were de&s;troyed it was too &s;oon to relate) that I for&s;ook home to return no more while Robe&s;pierre exi&s;ted; and Robe&s;pierre was then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hed dominion, the &s;pirit of liberty had
<PB N="88" REF="031634_0087_0FED61EDF5F9BFC0">
&s;o bowed it&s;elf beneath the axe of the guillotine, from the pa&s;toral hills of Normandy to the orange-groves of Nice, from the en&s;anguined banks of the Loire to the mourning waters of Vauclu&s;e, that when my mother, while &s;he gave me her la&s;t em|brace at parting, told me &s;he &s;hould &s;ee me no more, my de&s;ponding heart a&s;&s;ented to the &s;ad pre|diction. Upon the fall of the deputies who were pro&s;cribed the 31&s;t of May, and who were well known to have honoured us with their friend&s;hip, we became a &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion at the committee of public &s;afety, and a mandat d'arr&ecirc;t would cer|tainly have been i&s;&s;ued again&s;t us if we had not already been impri&s;oned in con&s;equence of the law again&s;t the Engli&s;h. By &s;haring the general mis|fortune of our countrymen in France, we were &s;heltered from any particular mark of vengeance. We afterwards obtained our liberty by means of the municipality, to whom we were unknown; and when the murderers had &s;atiated their vengeance in the blood of our friends, my family had no longer any peculiar danger to fear. But my &s;itu|ation was far different. During the &s;pring pre|ceding the fatal 31&s;t of May, when the deputies of the Gironde, and Barrere, pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of their evenings at our hou&s;e, I had not concealed that I was employed in writing &s;ome letters which have &s;ince been publi&s;hed in England, in which I had drawn the portrait of the tyrant in tho&s;e dark &s;hades of colouring that belonged to his hideous nature; and Barrere, in who&s;e power my life was placed, was now the lacquey of Robe&s;pierre, and the great inqui&s;itor of the Engli&s;h at Paris. He had now &s;eared his con&s;cience with crimes, and bathed his hands in the blood of the innocent. What &s;till increa&s;ed my danger was, that Barrere could not but recollect, with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
<PB N="89" REF="031634_0088_0FED61C7C646FAB8">
his pre&s;ent vilene&s;s in our eyes, the political &s;en|timents which he had expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e hours of &s;ocial confidence, when had he been told that he &s;hould become the accomplice of unrecorded hor|rors, he would have an&s;wered with the feelings of Hazael, "Is thy &s;ervant a dog, that he &s;hould do this thing?" He could not but recollect that on the third of June, the day after the in&s;urrection, he came to our hou&s;e with looks di&s;ordered and haggard, with eyes filled with tears, and a mind that &s;eemed bur&s;ting with indignant &s;orrow; repeatedly declaring that, &s;ince the national repre&s;entation was violated, liberty was lo&s;t; deploring the fate of the Gironde, above all of Vergniaud, and execrating the Jacobins, and the commune of Paris. A thou&s;and times he wi&s;hed that he could tran&s;port him&s;elf to the foot of his native mountains, the Pyren&eacute;es, bid adieu for ever to the polluted city of Paris, and wander for the re&s;t of his life amid&s;t that &s;ublime &s;cenery which he de&s;cribed with melancholy enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>It was not a little dangerous to have heard &s;uch &s;entiments from the lips of one who afterwards &s;aid boa&s;tingly in the convention, "Il n'y a que les morts qui ne reviennent pas;"&mdash;of one who became the leader of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations; and who, mounting the tribune with the light &s;tep of gaiety, dre&s;&s;ed up with point and epigram tho&s;e atrocious edicts of the committee to which his bleeding coun|try an&s;wered with her groans. Barrere al&s;o knew that there was no danger of my declaring the&s;e things at the revolutionary tribunal, &s;ince tho&s;e who were tried were not permitted to &s;peak: and he had no longer any ties of acquaintance with us which might have re&s;trained him from &s;uch con|duct; &s;ince very &s;oon after the 31&s;t of May, upon our refu&s;ing to receive &s;ome deputies of the moun|tain
<PB N="90" REF="031634_0089_0FED6174458BAD80">
whom he a&s;ked leave to introduce to us, he abandoned us altogether.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Engli&s;h new&s;papers came regularly to the committee of public &s;afety, in which pa&s;&s;ages from my letters were frequently tran&s;cribed, and the work mentioned as mine; and tho&s;e papers were con&s;tantly tran&s;lated into French for the members of the committee. Two copies of the work had al&s;o reached Paris; and although one was at my reque&s;t de&s;troyed, the other might, by means of tho&s;e domiciliary vi&s;its which were &s;o often repeated, have been thrown into the hands of revolutionary commi&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>Thus I pa&s;&s;ed the winter at Paris, with the knife of the guillotine &s;u&s;pended over me by a frail thread, when a &s;ingular opportunity of e&s;cape pre&s;ented it|&s;elf, and I fled to Switzerland, with a heart almo&s;t broken by the crimes I had witne&s;&s;ed, and the cala|mities I had &s;hared. I for&s;ook tho&s;e who were mo&s;t dear to me on earth, with no other con&s;olation than that I left them expo&s;ed only to the common danger of every individual in the country, and re|lieved from the cruel apprehen&s;ions they had felt on my account.</P>
<P>I proceeded on my journey haunted by the images of gens d'armes, who I fancied were pur&s;uing me, and with a &s;ort of &s;uper&s;titious per&s;ua&s;ion that it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould e&s;cape. I felt as if &s;ome magical &s;pell would chain my feet at the frontier of France, which &s;eemed to me a boundary that was impa&s;&s;able. As I approached the frontier the agi|tation of my &s;pirits increa&s;ed, and when I reached Bourg-Libre, the la&s;t French po&s;t where commi&s;|&s;aries were appointed to examine the pa&s;&s;ports and tho&s;e who pre&s;ented them, my heart &s;unk within me, and I tried to re&s;ign my&s;elf to a fate which
<PB N="91" REF="031634_0090_0FED621EC79934A8">
&s;eemed to my di&s;ordered mind inevitable. But I found that I had di&s;quieted my&s;elf in vain: revolu|tionary government had relaxed its iron nerve at this di&s;tance from the &s;eat of tyranny; and the commi&s;&s;aries on the frontiers, after having per|formed their office with the milde&s;t urbanity, &s;uf|fered us to proceed to Ba&s;il, which is only half a league further.</P>
<P>Some tall &s;takes driven into the earth at certain di&s;tances mark the limits of France and Switzer|land. We drove rapidly pa&s;t them, and were then beyond the reach of revolutionary government, and the axe of the guillotine.</P>
<P>At Ba&s;il, now almo&s;t the only &s;ocial &s;peck on Europe's wide &s;urface, where men meet for any other purpo&s;es than tho&s;e of mutual de&s;truction, I was in &s;afety: but I was an exile from my fa|mily&mdash;from the only friends I had left&mdash;my friends in England, to whom I had written immediately on my arrival, in the fulne&s;s of my heart, and with the fond per&s;ua&s;ion that they had trembled for my &s;afety and would rejoice in my deliverance, having (with few exceptions indeed!) returned no an|&s;wers to my letters. With what overwhelming &s;en&s;ations did I receive the tidings of the fall of Robe&s;pierre, which was to change the colour of my life, and give peace and con&s;olation to &s;o many millions of my fellow-creatures! After waiting till the &s;truggle maintained by the Jacobins again&s;t the national repre&s;entation had happily ended, I returned to Paris. On entering again that polluted city, a thou&s;and fatal recollections ru&s;hed upon my mind, a thou&s;and local &s;en&s;ations overwhelmed my &s;pirit. In driving along the Rue Honor&eacute;, the ap|palling proce&s;&s;ion of the guillotine aro&s;e before my troubled imagination&mdash;I &s;aw in the vehicles of death the &s;pectres of my murdered friends. The

magnificent &s;quare of the revolution, with all its gay buildings, appeared to me clotted with blood, and incumbered with the dead. Along the &s;ilent and de&s;erted &s;treets of the fauxbourg Germain, I &s;aw in&s;cribed in broad letters upon the gate of eve|ry hotel, "propri&eacute;te nationale," while the orphans who&s;e fathers and mothers have peri&s;hed on the &s;caf|fold, and who lived upon the alms of charity, pa&s;s in &s;ilence by the dwellings which are their rightful inheritance.&mdash;The red flag waving above the por|tals of their forfeited man&s;ions, reminded me of an image of horror in De Foe's hi&s;tory of the plague at London, where, he &s;ays, every hou&s;e that was infected was marked with a bloody &s;ign of the cro&s;s.</P>
<P>Yet at lea&s;t we are no longer condemned to de&s;|pair of finding ju&s;tice on earth. Every day is &s;ig|nalized by &s;uch acts of retribution, that it &s;eems as if heaven vi&s;ibly de&s;cended to puni&s;h the guilty, while at the &s;ame time mercy and humanity are binding up the wounds of the afflicted, and &s;et|ting the captive free. We &s;eem to live in regions of romance. Louvet, I&s;nard, and others of our pro&s;cribed friends &s;o long entombed in &s;ubterrane|ous dungeons, wandering over de&s;ert mountains, or concealed in the gloom of caverns unvi&s;ited by day, now re&s;tored to &s;ociety and to their country, recount to us the &s;ecrets of their pri&s;on-hou&s;e, their "hair-breadth '&s;capes" to which we li&s;ten with eager anxiety, and tremble at their pa&s;t dangers.&mdash;But I mu&s;t not thus anticipate. Let me lead you to the convent in the fauxbourg St. Antoine, to which we were transferred in order to make room at the Luxembourg for pri&s;oners whom it was thought expedient to guard more &s;trictly. We were taught by the admini&s;trators of the police to con&s;ider our removal as a mark of particular indul|gence towards us, &s;ince we &s;hould have the privi|lege
<PB N="93" REF="031634_0092_0FED61CA8ABC8CE8">
of &s;eeing our friends through the grate, and of walking occa&s;ionally in the garden of the convent. Our countrymen were condemned to remain in the Luxembourg, at which they repined and remon|&s;trated in vain. Wives were &s;eparated from their hu&s;bands, daughters from their fathers; and as far the greater part of the Engli&s;h were in confined circum&s;tances, and lived by their re&s;pective occu|pations, their re&s;ources being &s;topped by their im|pri&s;onment, the little &s;tore of a&s;&s;ignats which they had &s;aved from &s;eque&s;tration they were now forced to divide, and, in&s;tead of &s;haring their frugal meal together, their expences were doubled. Many were reduced to the mo&s;t cruel difficulties, who had been accu&s;tomed to maintain their families re&s;pectably by their indu&s;try, and felt that the hu|miliation of receiving alms was no &s;light aggrava|tion of the mi&s;eries of captivity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot re&s;i&s;t mentioning that Mon&s;. and Madame Du F&mdash;, with who&s;e misfortunes and who&s;e virtues you are acquainted, no &s;ooner heard that our property was confi&s;cated in France, and that in con&s;equence of an act of parliament our re&s;ources were &s;topped from England, then they wrote to tell us that their fortune was at our di&s;po&s;al. Tho&s;e generous friends, together with a few others, endeavoured to atone for the inju&s;tice of their countrymen by the &s;tedfa&s;t fidelity of their attachment. Such moments of trial and of danger are indeed fitted to be the te&s;t of friend&s;hip, and call forth the real character: in tho&s;e re&s;pects, the experience of a year of revolutionary government is equivalent to that of fifty years of ordinary life.</NOTE>. That part of the convent which the municipality had allotted for our pri&s;on con&s;i&s;ting only of bare walls, we were each of us permitted to return to our re&s;pective hou&s;es, in order to provide our&s;elves with beds, and what furniture and clothes we thought proper. We were attended thither by an in&s;pector of the police and guards, together with one of the com|mi&s;&s;aries of our own &s;ection, who had put the &s;eals on our apartments, and who on removing them
<PB N="94" REF="031634_0093_0FED619189450C00">
examined our papers, con&s;i&s;ting now only of a few poetical &s;craps which had e&s;caped the flames. Odes, elegies, and &s;onnets were in&s;tantly bundled up and &s;ent to the municipality, notwith&s;tanding my a&s;&s;urances that the mu&s;es to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed, far from being accomplices in any con|&s;piracy again&s;t liberty, had in all ages been its warme&s;t auxiliaries. With what melancholy &s;en|&s;ations did we re-vi&s;it that home from which we were again to be torn in a few hours! How often did my eyes wander over every object in our apart|ment! The chairs and tables, which we found in the &s;ame po&s;ition as we had left them on our fir&s;t impri&s;onment, &s;eemed like mute friends whom it was angui&s;h to leave, and who&s;e well-known atti|tudes recalled the comforts of the pa&s;t. With aching hearts we were once more led through the &s;treets of Paris to our new pri&s;on. This convent, called Les Anglai&s;es, was &s;till inhabited by twenty-three Engli&s;h nuns, and, as it was their own pro|perty, had not &s;hared the general fate of the mo|na&s;tic edifices. While the French monks and nuns had for more than a year before this period been driven from their retreats, the religious hou&s;es both of men and women, which belonged to the Eng|li&s;h, had been re&s;pected, and their inhabitants left undi&s;turbed. The Engli&s;h or rather Iri&s;h monks had, however, long &s;ince thrown off their habits, and conformed as well as they were able to the new &s;y&s;tem of opinions. But this was not the ca&s;e with tho&s;e religious &s;i&s;ters, who&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;tic attachment to the external &s;igns of their profe&s;&s;ion was greater, and their worldly wi&s;dom le&s;s. The inhabitants of the fauxbourg St. Antoine, where they re&s;ided, ac|cu&s;tomed from infancy to revere them, to have the wants of the poor &s;upplied at the gate of the con|vent, and, while under the former government they
<PB N="95" REF="031634_0094_0FED6213B0D023B8">
were treated with neglect or di&s;dain by others, to be there received with evangelical humility, felt that their e&s;teem and veneration for the nuns had &s;urvived their own &s;uper&s;titious belief. The con|querors of the Ba&s;tile, the terror of ari&s;tocracy, and the vanguard of revolutions, laying a&s;ide their bloody pikes and bayonets, humbled them&s;elves be|fore the&s;e holy &s;i&s;ters, whom a &s;ort of vi&s;ible &s;anctity &s;eemed to encompa&s;s, and whom they &s;uffered, not|with&s;tanding the general regulation, to wear the cheri&s;hed &s;ymbols of their order, the veil and the cro&s;s, and &s;even times a day to ring the bell for prayers. When we had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;entinels who guarded the convent, the gate was unlocked for our admi&s;&s;ion by a nun in her habit. She embra|ced us with affectionate warmth, and, addre&s;&s;ing us in Engli&s;h, begged we would be comforted, &s;ince &s;he and the other nuns who were to have the charge of us were our countrywomen and our &s;i&s;ters. This &s;oothing &s;ympathy, expre&s;&s;ed in our native language, formed &s;uch a contra&s;t to the rude ac|cents of in&s;pectors of police, that it &s;eemed as if &s;ome pitying angel had leaned from heaven to com|fort us. The kindne&s;s with which we were re|ceived by our amiable country-women, contri|buted to reconcile us to our chamber, which might more properly be called a pa&s;&s;age to other rooms, where the glowing tape&s;try of the Luxembourg was exchanged for plai&s;tered walls, and where we had to &s;uffer phy&s;ical as well as moral evils, the weather being inten&s;ely cold, and our wretched gallery having neither &s;tove nor chimney. One circum&s;tance tended to make our &s;ituation tolerable, which was that true &s;pirit of fraternity that pre|vailed in our community, con&s;i&s;ting of about forty female pri&s;oners be&s;ides the nuns. Into how happy a region would the world be transformed, if that
<PB N="96" REF="031634_0095_0FED6199C7CDD938">
mutual forbearance and amity were to be found in it which had power to cheer even the gloom of a pri&s;on!</P>
<P>In addition to the tie of common calamity was the tie of a common country; and in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation this bond of union appeared &s;o &s;trong, that it &s;eemed, as Dr. John&s;on &s;aid of family relations, that we were born each others friends. It was the general &s;tudy of the whole community to prevent each others wi&s;hes. There were no rich among&s;t us. The rich had made them&s;elves wings, and vani&s;hed away before the promulgation of the law again&s;t the Engli&s;h; but tho&s;e who had &s;till any re&s;ources left, &s;hared all their little luxuries and indulgencies with tho&s;e that had none. The young &s;uccoured the old, the active &s;erved the infirm, and the gay cheered the dejected. There were indeed among us a few per&s;ons, who born of French parents, having pa&s;&s;ed their whole lives in France, and not &s;peaking one word of our native language, &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed to find by their impri&s;onment that they were Engli&s;h women. They had no trace or re|collection of that country which in evil hour chanc|ed to give them birth, and did not ea&s;ily reconcile them&s;elves to the grated convent, while their French &s;i&s;ters were enjoying perfect liberty.</P>
<P>When &s;uch of the former nobility who were our fellow-pri&s;oners at the Luxembourg heard that we were going to be transferred to the fauxbourg St. Antoine, they gathered round us to expre&s;s their fears for our &s;afety in that frightful quarter of the city. I was per&s;uaded, on the contrary, that we had much more to fear while &s;hut up in this &s;tate pri&s;on with them&s;elves, than in the fauxbourg St. Antoine, the inhabitants of which were chiefly com|po&s;ed of workmen and mechanics, who in the cour&s;e of the revolution had acted too much in
<PB N="97" REF="031634_0096_0FED61442DA55938">
union to be led to perpetrate any partial mi&s;chief; &s;ince tho&s;e immen&s;e numbers which had power to overthrow government could not be bribed to com|mit ma&s;&s;acres.</P>
<P>The admini&s;trators of the police, when they or|dered preparations to be made for our reception, announced us to the &s;ection as being all the wives and daughters of milords anglois. This was no au&s;picious introduction: accordingly our fir&s;t care was to lay a&s;ide the honours and dignities conferred upon us by the officers of the police, and which certainly would not have been confirmed by the he|rald's office. The only di&s;tinction we now envied was that of belonging to the privileged cla&s;s who gained their bread by the labour of their hands, and who alone were exempted from the penalties of the law. We would thankfully have con&s;ented to purcha&s;e at the price of toil the &s;weets of liber|ty, when bereaved of which the &s;ickening &s;oul grows weary of exi&s;tence. In vain we tried to twine the flowers of &s;ocial plea&s;ure around the bars of our pri&s;on; in vain we "took the viol and the harp, or endeavoured to rejoice at the &s;ound of the organ." That good which alone gives value to every other, was wanting; and mu&s;ic was di&s;cor|dant, and conver&s;ation joyle&s;s.</P>
<P>Having repelled the calumnious report of our no|bility, the revolutionary committee of our &s;ection, un|der who&s;e in&s;pection we were placed, and who vi&s;ited us in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion every day, began to look upon us with a more propitious eye; and le&s;t our health &s;hould be impaired by confinement, they unlocked the garden gate, of the key of which &s;ince our arrival they had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to prevent any attempts to &s;cale the walls, and permitted us to walk two hours every day accompanied by them&s;elves. During the&s;e walks we found means to convince them that we had been
<PB N="98" REF="031634_0097_0FED61FBC0276DC0">
guilty of no other offence again&s;t the &s;tate, than that of being born in England; and the common principles of ju&s;tice taught the&s;e unlettered patriots to lament the &s;everity of our fate, which they en|deavoured to &s;often by every mark of hone&s;t kind|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The vi&s;its of the admini&s;tration of police were far le&s;s agreeable than tho&s;e of our good commi&s;&s;a|ries. The fir&s;t time they came, Brutus, one of their &s;ecretaries, fired with uncontrolable rage at the &s;ight of the nun who unlocked the gate for his admi&s;&s;ion, rudely &s;eized her veil, which he was with difficulty prevented from tearing off her face. This ferocious pagan threw down the cro&s;s which was erected in the garden, and trampled it under foot; and having poured forth a volley of impreca|tions again&s;t the great bell, which &s;till hung at the &s;teeple in&s;tead of being transformed into a cannon, he left the di&s;mayed nuns trembling with horror, and ha&s;tened to denounce the veils, the cro&s;&s;es, and the great bell at the municipality. The next morn|ing Pache, the mayor of Paris, &s;ent orders for the bell to be taken down, the cro&s;&s;es to be removed, and the nuns to throw off their habits immediately. Nothing could exceed their de&s;pair upon receiving this municipal mandate. The convent re&s;ounded with lamentations, and the veils which were now to be ca&s;t off were bathed with tears.</P>
<P>There was, however, little time to be allowed to the indulgence of unavailing &s;orrow. Brutus might return, and it was nece&s;&s;ary to proceed to action. Accordingly, a council of caps was called in the room of the &s;uperior; and after a delibera|tion, &s;ometimes interrupted by &s;ighs and &s;ometimes by plea&s;antry, we all went to work, and in a few hours &s;weeping trains were converted into gowns, and flowing veils into bonnets. One charming
<PB N="99" REF="031634_0098_0FED6147FB979998">
young nun, who was a pen&s;ive enthu&s;ia&s;t, begged that, if it were po&s;&s;ible, her bonnet might &s;hroud her face altogether; while another, who&s;e regards were not entirely turned away from this world, hinted that &s;he &s;hould have no objection to the decoration of a bow.</P>
<P>My chief con&s;olation during my confinement aro&s;e from the &s;ociety of &s;i&s;ter There&s;a, that amia|ble nun who &s;o much wi&s;hed to hide a face which nature had formed to excite love and admiration. It was impo&s;&s;ible to conver&s;e with her without feeling that the revolution was a ble&s;&s;ing, if it was only for having prohibited vows which robbed &s;oci|ety of tho&s;e who were formed to be its delight and ornament. I never met with a human creature who &s;eemed to approach nearer to the ideas we form of angelic purity, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a more cor|rected &s;pirit, or a more tender heart. Devotion was her fir&s;t delight, her unfailing &s;ource of hap|pine&s;s; and &s;ometimes, in&s;tead of regretting her fate, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her feelings, and was tempted to ex|claim with Pope,

<P>We were allowed the melancholy indulgence of &s;eeing our friends through an iron grate; and there were &s;till among the French &s;ome per&s;ons who&s;e courageous friend&s;hip, undi&s;mayed by all the frowns of power, and the increa&s;ing terrors of revolutionary mea&s;ures, did not abandon us in our pri&s;on. The

greater part of the Engli&s;h who were yet in France, having been e&s;tabli&s;hed in that country for years, had acquired &s;ome friends who lamented their mis|fortunes, and who ri&s;qued their own per&s;onal &s;afety by making unwearied efforts for their deliverance. The dre&s;s of our vi&s;itors was indeed not a little gro|te&s;que, the period being now arrived when the vi&s;i|ble &s;igns of patrioti&s;m were dirty linen, pantaloons, uncombed hair, red caps, or black wigs, and all, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;alind &s;ays, "denoting a carele&s;s di&s;order." The ob&s;olete term of <HI>mu&s;cadin,</HI> which means a &s;cent|ed fop, was revived; and every man who had the boldne&s;s to appear in a clean &s;hirt was branded with that appellation, and every woman who wore a hat was a <HI>mu&s;cadine;</HI> for the period was &s;till remember|ed when a round cap was the badge of roture, nor were the ari&s;tocratical preten&s;ions of the hat yet bu|ried in oblivion. It is remarkable enough, that at this period Robe&s;pierre always appeared not only dre&s;&s;ed with neatne&s;s, but with &s;ome degree of ele|gance, and, while he called him&s;elf the leader of the &s;ans-culottes, never adopted the co&s;tume of his band. His hideous countenance, far from being involved in a black wig, was decorated with hair carefully arranged, and nicely powdered; while he endeavoured to hide tho&s;e emotions of his inhuman &s;oul which his eyes might &s;ometimes have betrayed, beneath a large pair of green &s;pectacles, though he had no defect in his &s;ight.</P>
<P>At this period one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed wo|men that France has produced peri&s;hed on the &s;caf|fold. This lady was Madame Roland, the wife of the late mini&s;ter. On the 31&s;t of May he had fled from his pro&s;ecutors, and his wife who remained was carried to pri&s;on. The wits ob&s;erved on this occa&s;ion, that the body of Roland was mi&s;&s;ing, but that he had left his &s;oul behind. Madame Roland
<PB N="101" REF="031634_0100_0FED62C527FB2350">
was indeed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed ta|lents, and a mind highly cultivated by the &s;tudy of literature. I have been acquainted with her &s;ince I fir&s;t came to France, and had always ob&s;erved in her conver&s;ation the mo&s;t ardent attachment to li|berty, and the mo&s;t enlarged &s;entiments of philan|thropy; &s;entiments which &s;he developed with an eloquence peculiar to her&s;elf, with a flow and pow|er of expre&s;&s;ion which gave new graces and new energy to the French language. With the&s;e ex|traordinary endowments of mind &s;he united all the warmth of a feeling heart, and all the charms of the mo&s;t elegant manners. She was tall and well &s;hap|ed, her air was dignified, and although more than thirty-five years of age &s;he was &s;till hand&s;ome. Her countenance had an expre&s;&s;ion of uncommon &s;weet|ne&s;s, and her full dark eyes beamed with the bright|e&s;t rays of intelligence. I vi&s;ited her in the pri&s;on of St. Pelagie, where her &s;oul, &s;uperior to circum|&s;tances, retained its accu&s;tomed &s;erenity, and &s;he conver&s;ed with the &s;ame animated cheerfulne&s;s in her little cell as &s;he u&s;ed to do in the hotel of the mi|ni&s;ter. She had provided her&s;elf with a few books, and I found her reading Plutarch. She told me &s;he expected to die; and the look of placid re&s;ignation with which &s;he &s;poke of it, convinced me that &s;he was prepared to meet death with a firmne&s;s wor|thy of her exalted character. When I enquired after her daughter, an only child of thirteen years of age, &s;he bur&s;t into tears; and at the overwhelm|ing recollection of her hu&s;band and her child, the courage of the victim of liberty was lo&s;t in the feel|ings of the wife and the mother.</P>

When brought before the revolutionary tribunal &s;he pre&s;erved the mo&s;t heroical firmne&s;s, though &s;he was treated with &s;uch barbarity, and in&s;ulted by que&s;tions &s;o injurious to her honour, that &s;ometimes the tears of indignation &s;tarted from her eyes. This celebrated woman, who at the bar of the national convention had by the commanding graces of her eloquence forced even from her enemies the tribute of applau&s;e and admiration, was now in the hands of vulgar wretches, by whom her fine talents, far from being appreciated, were not even under&s;tood. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe a copy of her defence taken from her own manu&s;cript<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, No. III.</NOTE>. With keen regret I mu&s;t add, that &s;ome papers in her ju&s;tification, which &s;he &s;ent me from her pri&s;on, perhaps with a view that at &s;ome happier period, when the voice of innocence might be heard, I &s;hould make them public, I was compelled to de&s;troy, the night on which I was my|&s;elf arre&s;ted; &s;ince, had they been found in my po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, they would inevitably have involved me in her fate. Before I took this re&s;olution, which co&s;t me a cruel effort, I employed every means in my power to pre&s;erve tho&s;e precious memorials, in vain; for I could find no per&s;on who would venture to keep them amid&s;t the terrors of domiciliary vi&s;its, and the certainty, if they were found, of being put to death as an accomplice of the writer. But her fair fame &s;tands in no need of &s;uch te&s;timonials: her memory is embalmed in the minds of the wi&s;e and good, as one of tho&s;e glorious martyrs who have &s;ealed with their blood the liberties of their country. After hearing her &s;entence, &s;he &s;aid, "Vous me jugez digne de partager le &s;ort des grands hommes que vous avez a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in&eacute;s. Je t&acirc;|cherai

<P>On the day of her trial &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in white: her long dark hair flowed loo&s;ely to her wai&s;t, and her figure would have &s;oftened any hearts le&s;s fero|cious than tho&s;e of her judges.

She then turned to the executioner, and begged that this &s;ad indul|gence might be granted to her fellow-&s;ufferer. The executioner told her that he had received orders that &s;he &s;hould peri&s;h fir&s;t. "But you cannot, I am &s;ure," &s;aid &s;he with a &s;mile, "refu&s;e the la&s;t reque&s;t of a lady." The executioner complied with her demand. When &s;he mounted the &s;caffold, and was tied to the fatal plank, &s;he lifted up her eyes to the &s;tatue of Liberty, near which the guillotine was

placed, and exclaimed, "Ah Libert&eacute;, comme on t'a Jou&eacute;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Ah liberty! how ha&s;t thou been &s;ported with!"</NOTE>!" The next moment &s;he peri&s;hed. But her name will be recorded in the annals of hi&s;|tory, as one of tho&s;e illu&s;trious women who&s;e &s;upe|rior attainments &s;eem fitted to exalt her &s;ex in the &s;cale of being.</P>
<P>She had predicted that her hu&s;band would not &s;ur|vive her lo&s;s, and her prediction was fulfilled. Ro|land, who had concealed him&s;elf till this period, no &s;ooner heard the fate of his wife, who&s;e influence over his mind had often been a &s;ubject of reproach among&s;t his enemies, than, feeling that life was no longer worth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, he put an end to his exi&s;|tence. His body was found in a wood near the high-road between Paris and Rouen: the papers which were in his pocket-book were &s;ent to the committee of general &s;afety, and have never &s;een the light. His unhappy daughter found an a&s;ylum with an old friend of her pro&s;cribed parents, who had the courage to receive her at a period when it was imminently dangerous to afford her protection. But the time probably now draws near when this child will be adopted by her country, and an ho|nourable provi&s;ion will be made for her, as a te&s;|timony of national gratitude towards tho&s;e who gave her birth.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the extraordinary changes which were pa&s;&s;ing in France, the convention now changed time it&s;elf, and decreed the new calendar. A re|port was made on it, &s;o philo&s;ophical and &s;o plea&s;ing to the imagination, that, amid&s;t the &s;anguinary mea&s;ures of tho&s;e days, it &s;eemed to the oppre&s;&s;ed heart what a &s;olitary &s;pot of fre&s;h verdure appears to the eye amid&s;t the craggine&s;s of louring rocks, or the gloom of &s;avage de&s;erts.

<P>A FEW weeks after our relea&s;e from pri&s;on, Rabaut de St. Etienne was put to death. He was one of the mo&s;t enlightened and virtuous men whom the revolution had called forth, and had ac|quired general e&s;teem by his conduct as a legi&s;la|tor, and con&s;iderable reputation by his talents as a writer. He was the pre&s;ident of the famous com|mittee of twelve, which was appointed by the con|vention, previou&s;ly to the 31&s;t of May, to exa|mine into the con&s;piracies which threatened its ex|i&s;tence, and which, as I have already related, ha&s;|tened its partial di&s;&s;olution. Rabaut, as often as he pre&s;ented him&s;elf to make the report, was compel|led by the interruptions of the con&s;pirators and their agents to retire from the tribune, until that moment arrived, when he, together with the members of the commi&s;&s;ion, and the deputies of the Gironde, were expelled, or torn from the convention! I &s;aw him on this memorable day (for he took &s;helter for a few hours at our hou&s;e) filled with de&s;pair, not &s;o much for the lo&s;s of his own life, which he then con&s;idered as inevitable, as for that of the li|berty of his country, now falling under the vile&s;t
<PB N="108" REF="031634_0107_0FED632CF8849CD8">
de&s;poti&s;m. He e&s;caped arre&s;t on the 2d of June, from not having been pre&s;ent at the convention when the con&s;pirators con&s;ummated their crime by means of the military force of Paris, and con|cealed him&s;elf in the hou&s;e of a friend, with his brother, one of the &s;eventy-three deputies who had &s;igned the prote&s;t.</P>
<P>They enclo&s;ed part of a room for their place of &s;helter, and built up the wall with their own hands, placing a book-ca&s;e before the entrance, &s;o that there was not the lea&s;t appearance of conceal|ment. They employed a carpenter, in whom they had great confidence, to make the door, and the wretch betrayed them. Rabaut de St. Etienne was immediately brought before the revolutionary tribunal to have his per&s;on identified, for he was now outlawed, which in France is the &s;entence of death. He was led to execution; and his wife, a mo&s;t amiable women, unable to &s;upport the lo&s;s of a hu&s;band whom &s;he tenderly loved, put an end to her exi&s;tence. His brother was taken to the Con|ciergerie, where he langui&s;hed with three other victims, for many months in a &s;ubterraneous dun|geon; and there being only one bed allotted for four per&s;ons, he lay upon the damp floor, and con|tracted &s;uch violent di&s;orders, that his life was long de&s;paired of. He has now taken his &s;eat in the convention. The generous friend and his wife, who had given the brothers an a&s;ylum, were al&s;o dragged to pri&s;on; and &s;ome time after were con|demned, for this noble act of friend&s;hip, to peri&s;h on the &s;caffold.</P>
<P>If France, during the unrelenting tyranny of Robe&s;pierre, exhibited unexampled crimes, it was al&s;o the &s;cene of extraordinary virtue; of the mo&s;t affecting in&s;tances of magnanimity and kindne&s;s. Of this nature was the conduct of a young man,
<PB N="109" REF="031634_0108_0FED63368F0F5CA8">
who being a pri&s;oner with his brother, happened to be pre&s;ent when the names of the victims were called over, who were &s;ummoned to appear the next day before the &s;anguinary tribunal. The young man found the name of his brother, who at that moment was ab&s;ent, upon the fatal li&s;t. He pau&s;ed only an in&s;tant to reflect, that the life of the father of a large family was of more value than his own; he an&s;wered the call, &s;urrendered him&s;elf to the officer, and was executed in his brother's &s;tead. A father made the &s;ame &s;acrifice for his &s;on; for the tribunal was &s;o negligent of forms, that it was not difficult to deceive its vigilance.</P>
<P>The increa&s;ing horrors which every day pro|duced, had at length the effect of extingui&s;hing in every heart the love of life, that &s;entiment which clings &s;o fa&s;t to our nature. To die, and to get beyond the reach of oppre&s;&s;ion, appeared a privi|lege; and perhaps nothing appalled the &s;ouls of the tyrants &s;o much as that &s;erenity with which their victims went to execution. The page of hi&s;tory has held up to the admiration of &s;ucceeding ages, tho&s;e philo&s;ophers who have met death with forti|tude. But had they been led among the victims of Robe&s;pierre to execution, they would have found them&s;elves, in this re&s;pect, undi&s;tingui&s;hed from the crowd. They would have &s;een per&s;ons of each &s;ex, of all ages, and all conditions, looking upon death with a contempt equal to their own. So|crates expiring &s;urrounded by his friends, or Se|neca and Lucan &s;inking gently into death, have perhaps le&s;s claim to admiration than tho&s;e bloom|ing beauties, who in all the fir&s;t fre&s;hne&s;s of youth, in the very &s;pring of life, &s;ubmitted to the &s;troke of the executioner with placid &s;miles on their coun|tenances, and looked like angels in their flight to heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="031634_0109_0FED628AC2709E58">
Among the victims of the tyrants, the women have been peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed for their admi|rable firmne&s;s in death. Perhaps this aro&s;e from the &s;uperior &s;en&s;ibility which belongs to the female mind, and which made it feel that it was le&s;s terri|ble to die, than to &s;urvive the objects of its tender|ne&s;s. When the general who commanded at Long|wy on its &s;urrender to the Pru&s;&s;ians was condemned to die, his wife, a beautiful young woman of four-and-twenty years of age, who heard the &s;entence pronounced, cried out in a tone of de&s;pair, "Vive le roi!" The inhumane tribunal, in&s;tead of attri|buting her conduct to di&s;traction, condemned her to die. Her hu&s;band, when he was placed in the cart, was filled with a&s;toni&s;hment and angui&s;h when he &s;aw his beloved wife led towards it. The people, &s;hocked at the &s;pectacle, followed her to the &s;caf|fold, crying, "Elle n'a pas m&eacute;rit&eacute; la mort." "Mes amis," &s;aid &s;he, "c'e&s;t ma faute; j'ai vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lu p&eacute;rir avec mon mari<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"She did not de&s;erve death."&mdash;"My friends, it is my own fault; I was re&s;olved to peri&s;h with my hu&s;band."</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The fury of the&s;e implacable mon&s;ters &s;eemed directed with peculiar virulence again&s;t that &s;ex, who&s;e weakne&s;s man was de&s;tined by nature to &s;upport. The &s;caffold was every day bathed with the blood of women. Some who had been con|demned to die, but had been re&s;pited on account of their pregnancy, were dragged to death immediately after their delivery, in that &s;tate of weakne&s;s which &s;avages would have re&s;pected. One unfortunate woman, the wife of a pea&s;ant, had been brought to Paris, with nineteen other women of the &s;ame cla&s;s, and condemned to die with her companions. She heard her &s;entence without emotion; but when they came to carry her to execution, and take
<PB N="111" REF="031634_0110_0FED6358891DADE0">
away the infant who was hanging at her brea&s;t, and receiving that nouri&s;hment of which death was &s;o &s;oon to dry up the &s;ource, &s;he rent the air with her cries, with the &s;trong &s;hriek of in&s;tinctive af|fection, the piercing throes of maternal tenderne&s;s&mdash;But in vain! the infant was torn from the bo&s;om that cheri&s;hed it, and the agonies of the unfortu|nate mother found re&s;pite in death.</P>
<P>Fourteen young girls of Verdun, who had danc|ed at a ball given by the Pru&s;&s;ians, were led to the &s;caffold together, and looked like nymphs adorned for a fe&s;tival. Sometimes whole generations were &s;wept away at one moment; and the tribunal ex|hibited many a family-piece, which has almo&s;t bro|ken the heart of humanity. Male&s;herbes, the coun|&s;el of Louis XVI. was condemned to die, at eighty years of age, with his daughter, and &s;on-in-law, his grand-daughter and grand-&s;on.</P>
<P>His daughter &s;eemed to have lo&s;t &s;ight of every earthly object but her venerable parent: &s;he em|braced him a thou&s;and times on the way to execu|tion; bathed his face with her tears; and when the mini&s;ter of death dragged her from him, forgetting that the next moment put an end to her own, &s;he exclaimed, "Wretch, are you going to murder my father?"</P>
<P>The&s;e pro&s;cribed families &s;eemed to find the &s;weete&s;t &s;ource of con&s;olation in dying together, and to con&s;ider the momentary pa&s;&s;age which they were going to make, as &s;o much the le&s;s painful, &s;ince they &s;hould undergo no &s;eparation, but enter at the &s;ame in&s;tant into another &s;tate of exi&s;tence. A young lady, the former marchione&s;s of Bois-Berenger, was impri&s;oned in the Luxembourg with her whole family. When her father, mother, and younger &s;i&s;ter received their act of accu&s;ation, and &s;he found her&s;elf alone exempted, &s;he &s;hed a flood
<PB N="112" REF="031634_0111_0FED62FB06280CC0">
of tears, her heart was overwhelmed with angui&s;h. "You will die without me," &s;he cried; "I am condemned to &s;urvive you; we &s;hall not peri&s;h to|gether!" While &s;he abandoned her&s;elf to de&s;pair, her act of accu&s;ation arrived: a ray of tran&s;port was in&s;tantly diffu&s;ed over her countenance, &s;he flew into the arms of her parents, and embraced them. "My dear mother," &s;he exclaimed, "we &s;hall die together!" When the family was tran&s;|ferred to the Conciergerie, &s;he never left her mo|ther a moment, but watched over her with unwea|ried tenderne&s;s; and while &s;he tried to &s;ooth her &s;ufferings by her filial endearments, &s;he endea|voured to in&s;pire her with courage by the example of her own heroic fortitude. It was the picture of a &s;ort of Roman charity. The unfortunate mo|ther was mute, and her whole &s;oul &s;eemed petri|fied with horror. She &s;eemed another Niobe. Her admirable daughter died with the mo&s;t noble re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle Male&s;i, her younger &s;i&s;ter, when condemned to die, &s;aid to her father with na&iuml;vet&eacute;, "Je me &s;errerai tant contre vous, mon bon pere, vous qui &ecirc;tes &s;i honn&ecirc;te homme, que Dieu me lai&s;&s;era pa&s;&s;er malgr&eacute; mes p&ecirc;ch&eacute;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I will cling &s;o fa&s;t to you, my dear father, you, who are &s;o good, that God will &s;uffer me to pa&s;s in &s;pite of my tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions."</NOTE>."</P>
<P>In the pri&s;on of the Force, the men were allowed to breathe the air in a court-yard &s;eparated by a wall from the habitation of the women. A com|mon-&s;ewer was the only means of communication. At that &s;pot, an unhappy &s;on pre&s;ented him&s;elf every morning and every night, to enquire after his mother, who was condemned to die, but reprieved becau&s;e &s;he was pregnant, and after her dilivery executed. That pious child, in his early age al|ready

the victim of misfortune, knelt down before the infectious &s;ewer, and, with his mouth placed upon the hole, poured forth the feelings of his filial tenderne&s;s. His younger brother, a lovely child of three years of age, and who was &s;uffered to re|main with his mother till the la&s;t moments, was often placed at the oppo&s;ite end of the fewer, and an&s;wered for his mother when &s;he was too ill to undertake that ta&s;k her&s;elf. A per&s;on of my ac|quaintance heard him &s;ay, "Mama a moins pleure cette nuit&mdash;un peu repo&s;ee, et te fouhaite le bon jour; c'e&s;t Lolo, qui t'aime bien, qui te dit cela<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Mama has not cried &s;o much to-night&mdash;She has &s;lept a little, and wi&s;hes you a good morning: it is Lolo who &s;peaks to you, who loves you very much."</NOTE>." At length this unfortunate mother, when going to execution, tran&s;mitted to her &s;on, by the &s;ewer, her long and graceful tre&s;&s;es, as the only inheri|tance &s;he had to give. She then bade her infant a la&s;t farewell, and was led to the &s;caffold, where her hu&s;band had peri&s;hed &s;ome months before.</P>
<P>One of the per&s;ons mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by their noble contempt of death was Girey Dupr&eacute;, with whom I was well acquainted. He was the writer of a paper called the Patriote Fran&ccedil;ois, in con|junction with Bri&s;&s;ot: he had acquired a high de|gree of literary reputation, and maintained his mo|ther, a widow, by the labours of his pen. He was twenty-four years of age, and his countenance was one of the mo&s;t agreeable I ever &s;aw. To the&s;e per&s;onal advantages he united the mo&s;t frank and plea&s;ing manners, and di&s;tingui&s;hed powers of conver&s;ation. He had defended the deputies of the Gironde with too much energy not to be in|volved in their fate, and he was al&s;o connected by the ties of friend&s;hip with Bri&s;&s;ot. Dupr&eacute; was forced to fly from his per&s;ecutors, and &s;eek refuge
<PB N="114" REF="031634_0113_0FED62FF8519C940">
at Bordeaux, where he was &s;eized and brought back in irons to Paris. Far from being depre&s;&s;ed by his approaching fate, the natural gaiety of his di&s;po&s;ition never for&s;ook him a &s;ingle moment. When interrogated at the tribunal with re&s;pect to his connection with Bri&s;&s;ot, he an&s;wered only in the&s;e words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I knew Bri&s;&s;ot; I atte&s;t that he lived like Ari&s;tides, and died like Sydney the martyr of liberty."</NOTE>, "J'ai connu Bri&s;&s;ot; j'atte&s;te qu'il a v&eacute;cu comme Ari&s;tide, et qu'il e&s;t mort comme Sydney martyr de la libert&eacute;." He pre&s;ented him|&s;elf at the tribunal with his hair cut off, the collar of his &s;hirt thrown open, and already prepared for the &s;troke of the executioner. On his way to the &s;caffold he &s;aw Robe&s;pierre's mi&s;tre&s;s at the window of his lodging, with her &s;i&s;ter, and &s;ome of their ferocious accomplices. "A bas les tyrans et les dictateurs<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Down with tyrants and Dictators!"</NOTE>!" cried Dupr&eacute;, repeating this prophe|tic exclamation till he lo&s;t &s;ight of the hou&s;e. While going to execution, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ung in a triumphant tone a very popular patriotic &s;ong which he had him&s;elf compo&s;ed, and of which the chorus was "Plut&ocirc;t la mort que l'e&s;clavage<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">"Rather death than &s;lavery!"</NOTE>." That che|ri&s;hed &s;entiment he fondly repeated even to his la&s;t moment, and death left the half-fini&s;hed &s;entence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his lips:</P>
<P>Claviere, who had been contemporary mini&s;ter with Roland, and who was impri&s;oned in the Con|ciergerie, upon receiving his act of accu&s;ation, &s;aw that the li&s;t of witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him was compo&s;ed of his mo&s;t implacable enemies. "The&s;e are a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins," &s;aid he to a fellow-pri&s;oner; "I will &s;natch my&s;elf from their rage." He then repeated the&s;e lines of Voltaire,

and after deliberating with his companion upon the mo&s;t effectual manner of &s;triking him&s;elf &s;o that the dagger might reach his heart, he retired to his cell, where he was found a few minutes after breathing his la&s;t &s;igh. Madam Claviere, upon receiving the tidings of his death, &s;wallowed poi|&s;on, after having embraced her children, and regu|lated her affairs. Notwith&s;tanding his &s;uicide, the property of Clavierre was confi&s;cated, as if he had been regularly condemned. A law had lately been pa&s;&s;ed to con&s;true an act of &s;uicide into a counter-revolutionary project, when the father of a family who knew that his life was devoted, had volunta|rily put an end to his exi&s;tence in the hope of pre|&s;erving his children from want. Robe&s;pierre and his financial agents found nothing more pre&s;&s;ing than to baffle tho&s;e con&s;piracies again&s;t the revenues of their government; for confi&s;cation was &s;o evi|dently the leading motive for the great ma&s;s of their judicial a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, that the guillotine, among&s;t other numerous titles, was mo&s;t generally called the "mini&s;ter of finance."

<P>On &s;ome occa&s;ions the genuine feelings of nature bur&s;t forth amid&s;t the &s;tupefied terror that had fro|zen every heart. A law had lately pa&s;&s;ed, oblig|ing every merchant to in&s;cribe on his door the &s;tock of merchandize in his warehou&s;e, under the penal|ty

of death. A wine-merchant, who&s;e affairs had called him ha&s;tily into the country, entru&s;ted the bu&s;ine&s;s of the in&s;cription to his &s;on, who from ig|norance or negligence, for it was clearly proved that there exi&s;ted no intention of fraud, had omit|ted to affix the declaration in the preci&s;e words of the law. The con&s;cientious jury of the revolution|ary tribunal condemned him to death, pre&s;uming on the counter-revolutionary intention in this ca&s;e from the act, though they were in general accu&s;|tomed, for want of other evidence, to find the act by gue&s;&s;ing at the intention. The innocent pri&s;on|er had prepared him&s;elf for death, when the mini|&s;ter of ju&s;tice, informed of the ca&s;e, wrote to the convention, demanding a re&s;pite. His letter had not been half read before the hall re&s;ounded with the cry of "reprieve, reprieve!" and fearing that the act of parliament would arrive too late, the con|vention, di&s;pen&s;ing with the u&s;ual formalities, not only &s;ent its officers and part of the military force, but great numbers of the deputies ru&s;hed out to &s;top the execution. The officer who received the order fir&s;t, with which he flew towards the place of the revolution, told me that on his coming out of the convention he &s;aw the &s;caffold reared and the crowd a&s;&s;embled. He had &s;carcely reached the fir&s;t tree of the vi&s;ta when he &s;aw the fatal knife de|&s;cend; he redoubled his &s;peed, but before he got to the end of the walk another head had fallen: a third per&s;on had mounted the &s;caffold, but the voice of the me&s;&s;enger was too weak, from the efforts he had made to reach the &s;pot, to be noticed by the multitude. The fourth had a&s;cended when he gained the place, ru&s;hed through the crowd, called to the executioner, and leaped on the &s;caffold. The pri&s;oner had been &s;tripped, his &s;houlders were bare, and he was already tied to the plank; when the
<PB N="117" REF="031634_0116_0FED62DBDB86EFA0">
cry of "reprieve" bur&s;t forth. The officer en|quired his name, which the young man told him. "Alas! you are not the per&s;on," he replied. The pri&s;oner &s;ubmitted calmly to his fate.</P>
<P>The bearer of the reprieve, who is a per&s;on of a very benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, declared that he ne|ver felt &s;o acute a pang as when he was compell|ed to turn away from this unfortunate victim. He ha&s;tened, however, to the pri&s;on, where he found the per&s;on who was reprieved awaiting the return of the cart and the executioner, his hair cut and his hands tied, to be led to death at another part of the city where his hou&s;e &s;tood. A wife and nine children were deploring the mi&s;erable lo&s;s of a hu&s;band and a father, when the officer who had brought the tidings of life to the pri&s;oner, went at his reque&s;t to carry them to his di&s;tracted fa|mily. I need not de&s;cribe what he related to me of the &s;cene&mdash;your heart will readily fill up the picture.</P>
<P>That cla&s;s of men who were peculiarly the ob|ject of the tyrant's rage-were men of letters, with re&s;pect to whom the jealou&s;y of the rival mingled with the fury of the oppre&s;&s;or, and again&s;t whom his hatred was le&s;s implacable for having oppo&s;|ed his tyranny, than for having eclip&s;ed his elo|quence. It is a curious con&s;ideration, that the unexampled crimes of this &s;anguinary u&s;urper, and the con&s;equent mi&s;eries which have de&s;olated the fine&s;t country of Europe, may perhaps, if traced to their &s;ource, be found to ari&s;e from the re&s;ent|ment of a di&s;appointed wit. Robe&s;pierre, for the misfortune of humanity, was per&s;ecuted by the mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf as an ora|tor, and nature had denied him the power. He and his brother were born at Arras, and left orphans at an early age. The bi&s;hop of Arras had be&s;towed on them the advantages of a liberal education. Ro|be&s;pierre

di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his application to his fir&s;t &s;tudies, and obtained many literary prizes. At the age of &s;ixteen, elated by the applau&s;e he had received, he fancied him&s;elf endowed with &s;uch rare power of genius as would enable him to act a &s;plendid part on the theatre of the world, and his friends indulged the &s;ame fond expectation. He applied to the &s;tudy of the law, and already in ima|gination contemplated him&s;elf di&s;puting with the fir&s;t orators of the age the palm of eloquence. Ex|perience, however, convinced his friends, and at length him&s;elf, that they had indulged a vain illu|&s;ion. He di&s;covered no ta&s;te or aptitude for the profe&s;&s;ion for which he was de&s;igned, became wea|ry of &s;tudy, was checked by the &s;lighte&s;t difficul|ties; and being found de&s;titute of tho&s;e talents which were nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;ucce&s;s as a public &s;peaker, his benefactor, after a trial of &s;ufficient length, re|fu&s;ed to &s;upport him any longer at a con&s;iderable and fruitle&s;s expence at Paris, but ordered him to return to Arras, where in an humble &s;phere, bet|ter &s;uited to the mediocrity of his abilities, he might pur&s;ue his profe&s;&s;ion as a lawyer. Robe&s;pierre was compelled to return to Arras; which, after the &s;plen|did dreams he had indulged of fame and honours in the capital, was an humiliation he felt keenly, but which he brooded over in &s;ilence: for he never on any occa&s;ion di&s;played his &s;en&s;ibility to mortifica|tions, which was in proportion to his exce&s;&s;ive va|nity, but concentered within his vindictive &s;oul his di&s;grace, his re&s;entment, and his projects of venge|ance. From the period of his return to Arras may be dated his abhorrence of men of talents. From that moment, in&s;tead of admiring genius, he re|pined at its exi&s;tence. The &s;ame feelings clung to his ba&s;e and envious &s;pirit when he had u&s;urped his dictatorial power. He made it pain of death to be

the author of what he called &s;editious publications, by which means it was ea&s;y for him to involve men of letters in a general pro&s;cription. He &s;uppre&s;&s;ed every dramatic piece in which there were any allu|&s;ions he di&s;liked, or wherein the picture or hi&s;tory held up to view any feature of his own character. And it was his plan to aboli&s;h theatrical entertain|ments altogether; for he con&s;idered the applau&s;e be&s;towed on fine poetry as &s;omething of which his harangues were defrauded.

<P>One of the objects of Robe&s;pierre's re&s;entment was M. Bitauby, a Pru&s;&s;ian, well known in the li|terary world by his elegant tran&s;lation of Homer into French. He was a member of the academy at Berlin, from which the king of Pru&s;&s;ia ordered his name to be &s;truck out, and the pen&s;ion with which the great Frederic had rewarded his merit to be di&s;continued, on account of his avowed attachment to the principles of the revolution. M. Bitauby had fixed his re&s;idence at Paris &s;everal years previ|ous to that event. I have been acquainted with him and his lady &s;ince my fir&s;t arrival in France, and have never met with per&s;ons who blended with the
<PB N="121" REF="031634_0120_0FED632B4D2F6978">
wi&s;dom and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of age, &s;o much of all that is amiable in youth. M. Bitauby, in the fir&s;t days of the revolution, had been per&s;onally acquainted with Robe&s;pierre, who frequently dined at his hou&s;e; but he was not long in di&s;covering the &s;an|guinary and fanatical ideas of liberty which filled the &s;oul of the tyrant, and which &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted him that he gave up his acquaintance.</P>
<P>Robe&s;pierre did not forget the affront, which he had now the power to avenge. M. Bitauby and his wife were dragged to pri&s;on in the beginning of the winter, where they langui&s;hed ten months; and deprived of tho&s;e cares which their age and their infirmities required, they had almo&s;t &s;unk beneath their weight. Madame Bitauby's indi&s;po&s;itions re|quired medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but &s;o many formalities were nece&s;&s;ary before a phy&s;ician could be admitted into the pri&s;on, that, if the di&s;order was not of a lingering nature, the patient expired while the po|lice were arranging the ceremonials previous to his relief. During the la&s;t months of Robe&s;pierre's u&s;urpation, the pri&s;oners were refu&s;ed the con&s;ola|tion of being attended by their own phy&s;icians. Profe&s;&s;ional men were appointed by the police; and as &s;elections were made among tho&s;e who were able to give clearer proofs of their Jacobin principles than of their medical &s;kill, the&s;e revolutionary doc|tors &s;ometimes robbed the revolutionary jury of their prey. A few however of the&s;e "officers of health" po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the negative merit which Dr. Franklin a&s;cribed to old and experienced phy&s;icians, "<HI>they let</HI> their patients die," for the remedies they admini&s;tered were of too harmle&s;s a nature to be capable of doing mi&s;chief. The phy&s;ician of the Conciergerie had as &s;trong a predilection for ti&s;anne as Dr. Sangrado for hot water. Ti&s;anne was the vivifying draught which was de&s;tined to &s;ooth all
<PB N="122" REF="031634_0121_0FED6251DEEEDE78">
pains, and heal all maladies. One day the doctor, after having felt a patient's pul&s;e, &s;aid to the jailor, "He is better this morning." "Yes," an&s;wered the jailor, "<HI>he</HI> is better, but the per&s;on who lay in this bed ye&s;terday is dead." "Eh bien," re&s;umed the doctor coolly, "qu'on donne toujours la ti&s;anne."</P>
<P>M. and Madame Bitauby had an advocate in their di&s;tre&s;s whom it was difficult indeed to re&s;i&s;t. This was an old &s;ervant of eighty years of age. His fi|gure was &s;o intere&s;ting that Sterne's pencil only could &s;ketch in well; and had Sterne &s;een him, he would not have failed to draw his portrait. He pleaded me cau&s;e of his ma&s;ter with &s;uch pathetic eloquence, that at the revolutionary committee he &s;ometimes "drew iron tears from Pluto's cheek." But the old man was eloquent in vain, and was &s;inking with de&s;pair into the grave when the revo|lution of the 9th of Thermidor re&s;tored his ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of liberty.</P>
<P>The fate of Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cheu, author of a poem called "The Months," excited particular &s;ympathy.

<P>Lavoi&s;ier, the celebrated chemi&s;t, was put to death with the other farmers general. He reque&s;t|ed a fortnight's re&s;pite to enable him to complete a philo&s;ophical experiment.

La Harpe was thrown into pri&s;on, and was de&s;tined to peri&s;h on the &s;caffold. The author of the Travels of the younger Anachar&s;is, notwith&s;tanding his advanced age, was the object of continual per&s;ecution. Flo|rian, who was him&s;elf impri&s;oned, and condemned to &s;ee his deare&s;t friends peri&s;h, had not &s;ufficient fortitude to &s;u&s;tain &s;uch trials. His charming pen had di&s;played the mo&s;t &s;oothing images of happi|ne&s;s and virtue; and when he beheld around him only mi&s;ery and crimes, his di&s;ordered imagination ha&s;tened his death.

<P>ONE of the particular objects of Robe&s;pierre's rage was general Miranda, a native of Peru, well known in Europe by that philanthropic &s;pirit of ad|venture which led him to pa&s;s many years in tra|velling through various parts of the globe, with the view of being u&s;eful to his own country; which, &s;ince the period of the &s;anguinary Spani&s;h con|que&s;ts, has groaned beneath the yoke of the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery.

Miranda has certainly more of the &s;edate dignity of a Spaniard, than the bri&s;k air of a Frenchman; and if that eleva|tion of &s;oul which &s;corns to make any compo&s;ition with princi|ples be <HI>haughtine&s;s,</HI> and that inflexibility which &s;tedfa&s;tly pur&s;ues the &s;traight path of integrity and honour be <HI>hardne&s;s of character,</HI> Dumourier is in the right.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When the Pru&s;&s;ians were on their march to|wards Paris, Miranda accepted a command in the army of Dumourier, who was then retreating be|fore them. After the defeat of the Pru&s;&s;ians, and on the entrance of the republican army into the Low Countries, Miranda added to the high repu|tation he had already acquired through Europe, by the gallant manner in which he executed that part of the conque&s;t of tho&s;e countries which was allotted him. When Dumourier came to Paris, the com|mand of the whole army devolved on Miranda; and when the campaign began, and Dumourier was in|vading Holland, the attack of Mae&s;tricht, and the army on the Meu&s;e, were committed to his care. The &s;ucce&s;sful march of the Au&s;trians on Aix-la-Chapelle obliged him to rai&s;e the &s;iege; and he was joined &s;oon after by Dumourier, who had left his conque&s;t in Holland to repair the misfortunes of the army commanded by Valence. The ill hu|mour which Dumourier had brought with him from Paris, where the Jacobins had already begun their &s;y&s;tem of mi&s;rule and anarchy, was not le&s;|&s;ened
<PB N="126" REF="031634_0125_0FED633F14A73370">
by ill &s;ucce&s;s; and goaded by the pang of in|dignation and of di&s;appointed ambition, he formed the criminal de&s;ign of betraying the republic. This &s;pirit of rebellion found the mo&s;t inflexible oppo&s;i|tion from Miranda, who&s;e per&s;onal friend&s;hip for Dumourier did not lead him to forget that his fir&s;t duty was towards that country which had entru&s;ted him with its defence. The event of the battle of Nerwinden, fought again&s;t the repeated advice of Miranda, and in which this general lo&s;t a con&s;ider|able part of the troops he commanded, having been forced to &s;u&s;tain the whole &s;hock of the enemy, af|forded Dumourier the means of getting rid of an opponent &s;o ho&s;tile to his de&s;igns; and Miranda was &s;ent by the commi&s;&s;aries La Croix and Dan|ton, without being previou&s;ly heard by them, to give an account of his conduct at the bar of the convention. He underwent the mo&s;t &s;trict exami|nation before the committees of war and general &s;afety, who declared, that not the &s;lighte&s;t doubt remained of his military conduct, or his fidelity to the republic. But this report was &s;tifled by the intrigues of La Croix, Danton, and others of their party; and he was &s;ent, in defiance of all decency, to the revolutionary tribunal.</P>
<P>His trial took place in the beginning of May, before ju&s;tice had for ever fled from that &s;angui|nary court. The hour of carnage was not yet arrived: the tribunal, though from its in&s;titution terrible, and cruel in its forms, which placed the life of the accu&s;ed upon a ca&s;ting voice, had not yet become a &s;hrine con&s;ecrated to infernal deities, and reeking with the daily &s;acrifice of human vic|tims. The voice of innocence was not yet &s;tifled by the &s;avage vociferations of mon&s;ters thir&s;ting for its blood; and Miranda pleaded his cau&s;e with &s;uch &s;ublime energy, as proved that his powers as

<P>After his trial he retired to a &s;mall di&s;tance from Paris, where he lived in literary lei&s;ure, amid&s;t his books and paintings, and where I vi&s;ited him frequently. His repo&s;e was however of &s;hort du|ration. He was too di&s;tingui&s;hed a character to e&s;cape the tyranny which the con&s;piracy of the 31&s;t of May had e&s;tabli&s;hed; and after having been per|&s;ecuted by domiciliary vi&s;its on various pretences, he was again thrown into pri&s;on, charged with being the chief defender and abettor of the Gi|ronde and Girondi&s;m. The real cau&s;e of Robe&s;|pierre's animo&s;ity towards him is not well known, but may be re&s;olved into that general hatred which he bore towards all men of talents; and as he knew that the eminent abilities of Miranda were improved by advantages which had fallen to the lot of few, he might naturally think that the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a man was dangerous to his own.</P>
<P>Twice, in the zenith of his tyranny, he accu&s;ed Miranda to his &s;ubjects the Jacobins; and when we heard that the name of Miranda had i&s;&s;ued from tho&s;e pe&s;tilential lips, we con&s;idered his murder as inevitable. One ob&s;tacle was found &s;ufficient to &s;hield him from the tyrant's vengeance; and this was a feeling of &s;hame which lurked in the mind of the public accu&s;er, who, covered as he was with blood, did not dare to meet the look of Mi|randa, and bring forward a &s;econd accu&s;ation, after having once joined the general voice of applau&s;e upon his acquittal. This &s;entiment led Fouquier Tainville to put off the &s;econd trial required by Robe&s;pierre, till the tyrant would hear of delay

and excu&s;es no more; and him&s;elf in&s;cribed Mi|randa's name on the fatal li&s;t for the twelfth of Thermidor. The revolution of the tenth re&s;tored him to liberty.</P>
<P>Miranda &s;ubmitted to an impri&s;onment of eigh|teen months, under the continual expectation of death, with that philo&s;ophical &s;trength of mind which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in a mo&s;t emiment degree. He had indeed determined not to be dragged to the guillotine, and had therefore provided him&s;elf with poi&s;on. Thus armed, he &s;ent for a con&s;iderable number of books from his library, and placed them in his little chamber, of which he found means to keep the &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Here he told me, that he endeavoured to forget his pre&s;ent &s;ituation in the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory and &s;cience. He tried to con|&s;ider him&s;elf as a pa&s;&s;enger on a long voyage, who had to fill up the vacuity of time with the re|&s;earches of knowledge, and was alike prepared to peri&s;h or to reach the &s;hore. During his long confinement, the only per&s;on with whom he a&s;&s;o|ciated was the former marquis Achille Du Cha|telet, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the accompli&s;hments of literature, and whom the tyrants had dragged to pri&s;on while the wounds were yet unhealed which he had received in defending his country. He and Miranda u&s;ed to meet every evening, take their tea together, and talk over the books they had read during the day, avoiding as much as po&s;&s;ible the &s;ubject of politics, which affected them too deeply, nor could Du Chatalet bear to pronounce the names of the decemvirs. Tidings, however, of the horrible &s;cenes which were pa&s;|&s;ing in Paris reached him in the gloom of his pri&s;on; and the emotions of his mind, together with the irritation of his wound, produced a fe|ver. Miranda attended him day and night alter|nately
<PB N="129" REF="031634_0128_0FED631D079F2048">
with another pri&s;oner; and he was reco|vering from this di&s;order, when he heard that &s;ome of his deare&s;t friends had peri&s;hed on the &s;caffold. The next morning, when Miranda went to his room to relieve a fellow-pri&s;oner who had watched him during the night, he ob&s;erved that his whole face was violently inflamed. He en|quired eagerly what was the matter. Du Cha|telet pre&s;&s;ed his hand, and bade him farewell. This unfortunate young man, unable to &s;upport the &s;hock occa&s;ioned by the murder of his friends, and grown weary of exi&s;tence, re&s;olved not to wait till the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins called him to the &s;caffold, but had recour&s;e to poi&s;on, with which he had pro|vided him&s;elf. A phy&s;ician had furni&s;hed Verg|niaud, Du Chatelet, and &s;everal other martyrs to their country, with this lethean remedy, which they called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pill of liberty.</NOTE> la pillule de la libert&eacute;. A note was found in Du Chatelet's chamber, in which he declared that he had &s;old his books and all that belonged to him in the pri&s;on, to Miranda. This was the only mode in which he could leave his ef|fects to his friend, or prevent their being &s;eized by the nation.</P>
<P>Miranda found a memorial among his papers, which he has put into my hands, where he traces the hi&s;tory of his political life. It contains an ho|nourable li&s;t of the &s;acrifices he had made, the la|bours he had atchieved, and the perils he had en|countered in the public cau&s;e, from the period when in 1789 he contributed in the baillage of Per|ronne to the union of the nobles with the third e&s;tate, till the middle of the year 1793; when, although his wounds were not clo&s;ed, he de&s;ired leave to re|turn to the army, and obtained the command of
<PB N="130" REF="031634_0129_0FED62D90A2C6A78">
the di&s;trict of Aire. But he &s;oon found that his infirmities did not permit him to fulfil the duties of his &s;tation:&mdash;he was obliged to return; and though his fortune was now lo&s;t, he refu&s;ed to accept his pay as a general officer, &s;ince he was no longer able to &s;erve his country. At the very moment when he was preparing to return home, he was arre&s;ted by the revolutionary committee at Aire, as a mea|&s;ure of "<HI>general &s;afety,</HI>" and conducted with guards to the committee of general &s;afety of the conven|tion, who, with the &s;ame tender regard for public &s;e|curity, in&s;tead of declaring that this gallant young officer had merited well of his country, &s;ent him to the pri&s;on of the Force, and refu&s;ed to let his &s;ervant enter for a few minutes in the day to dre&s;s his wound. His pri&s;on &s;ix months after became his grave, and he was placed beyond the reach of ty|ranny. Miranda was then left to ab&s;olute &s;olitude; but he had &s;till the courage to live, and at length the hour of deliverance arrived.</P>
<P>You will perhaps think, dear &s;ir, that the &s;ketch which I have given you of public and private ca|lamity is &s;ufficiently gloomy. But, alas! the &s;cene blackens as we advance, and wears a deeper horror. We have now arrived at that period when the ty|rant, grown bolder by &s;ucce&s;s, intoxicated with power, and throwing a&s;ide all regard even to forms, reaching the climax of his crimes, and accelerated the moment of his fall. You will view him and the agents of his iniquity no longer &s;atisfied with victims in detail: they now murder in <HI>ma&s;s,</HI> and, in the words of Racine,
<Q><L>"Lavent dans le &s;ang leurs bras en&s;anglant&eacute;s."</L></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall in the cour&s;e of a fortnight &s;end you a hi&s;|tory of the a&s;t &s;cenes of this foul tragedy, and give
<PB N="131" REF="031634_0130_0FED62A4DD1FFA78">
you &s;uch a detail; as can only be learnt on the &s;pot, of the events which produced the revolution of the 9th of Thermidor, and of the incidents which on that memorable night determined the fate of the French republic.</P>
<P>In the mean time, you will not exclaim as the Roman poet did with re&s;pect to religion, "Of &s;o many evils could Liberty have been the cau&s;e!" It is, alas! the condition of our unin&s;tructed nature, that nations like individuals &s;hould acquire wi&s;dom only in the &s;chool of experience; and though the page of hi&s;tory, which according to Lord Boling-broke is "philo&s;ophy teaching by example," be open before us, we are too pre&s;umptuous, or too carele&s;s, to heed or apply the le&s;&s;on. I need not make u&s;e of any rea&s;oning to convince you that Li|berty is innocent of the outrages committed under its borrowed &s;anction; for though we might from &s;ome momentary impul&s;e bla&s;pheme its name, as Lucretius did that of religion, we mu&s;t be per&s;uad|ed that neither religion nor liberty is chargeable with the crimes committed by tyranny or &s;uper&s;ti|tion. As no weeds are more pernicious than tho&s;e which ari&s;e in that &s;oil from which good fruit alone &s;hould have &s;prung, &s;o no crimes have exceeded tho&s;e which the tyrant and the fanatic have com|mitted in the name of Freedom, the guardian angel of the happine&s;s of mankind, and in that of the Be|ing "who&s;e tender mercies are over all his works."</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not conclude without informing you, that the dark picture which you have been contemplating is relieved by a bright and &s;oothing per&s;pective. The pa&s;t &s;eems like one of tho&s;e frightful dreams which pre&s;ents to the di&s;turbed &s;pirit phantoms of unde&s;cribable horror, and "deeds without a name;" awakened from which, we hail with rapture the cheering beams of the morning, and anticipate the

Its internal &s;itua|tion will no more offer a hideous contra&s;t to its ex|ternal victories.

There &s;carcely exi&s;ts a family or an individual in France, that has not been be|reaved by tyranny of &s;ome dear relation, &s;ome cho|&s;en friend, who &s;eems from the grave to call upon them with a warning voice to watch over the liber|ties of their country. The love of public virtue in the people of France is now blended with all the &s;ympathies and affections of their natures: it is heard in the &s;ighs of general mourning; it &s;peaks in the tears of the widow and the orphan; and is not only imprinted by every argument that can render it &s;acred and durable on the under&s;tanding, but clings to every feeling of the heart.</P>

<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE far along the moral horizon of France the tempe&s;t became every hour more black and tur|bulent, the &s;pring, earlier and more profu&s;e of graces than in the climate of England, aro&s;e in its un|&s;ullied fre&s;hne&s;s, and formed a contra&s;t at which hu|manity &s;ickened. The lovely environs of Paris are
<PB N="133" REF="031634_0132_0FED627BC4801980">
not, like tho&s;e of London, &s;o encumbered with hou&s;es and buildings that you mu&s;t travel ten or twelve miles from town to find the country, but, the moment you have pa&s;&s;ed the barriers of the city, pre&s;ent you with all the charming variety of vine-clad hills, and fields, and woods, and lawns. Im|mediately after our relea&s;e from pri&s;on we quitted our apartments in the centre of the town, and tried to &s;helter our&s;elves from ob&s;ervation in an habitation &s;ituated in the mo&s;t remote part of the fauxbourg Germain. From thence a few minutes walk led us to the country. But we no longer dared, as we had done the preceeding year, to forget awhile the horrors of our &s;ituation by wandering occa&s;ionally amid&s;t the noble parks of St. Cloud, the wild woods of Meudon, or the elegant gardens of Bellevue, all within an hour's ride of Paris. Tho&s;e &s;eats, once the re&s;idence of fallen royalty, were now haunted by vulgar de&s;pots, by revolutionary commi&s;&s;aries, by &s;pies of the police, and &s;ometimes by the &s;anguinary decemvirs them&s;elves. Often they held their fe&s;|tive orgies in tho&s;e &s;cenes of beauty, where they dared to ca&s;t their polluting glance on nature, and tread with profane &s;teps her hallowed rece&s;&s;es. Even the revolutionary jury u&s;ed &s;ometimes on a decadi, the only day of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion from their work of death, to go to Marly or Ver&s;ailles; and, &s;teep|ed as they were to the very lips in blood, without being haunted by the mangled &s;pectres of tho&s;e whom they had murdered the preceding day, they &s;aw nature in her mo&s;t benign a&s;pect, pleading the cau&s;e of humanity and mercy, and returned to fea&s;t upon the groans of tho&s;e whom they were to mur|der on the morrow.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e regions of decorated beauty being now forbidden ground, we confined our walks to &s;ome pa&s;turage lands near the town, which were inter|&s;per&s;ed
<PB N="134" REF="031634_0133_0FED631FD5155E90">
with a few &s;cattered hamlets, and &s;kirted by hills, and were &s;o unfrequented, that we heard no &s;ounds except the &s;heep-bell, and the nightingales, and &s;aw no human figure but an old pea&s;ant with a white beard, who together with a large black dog took care of the flock. It was in the&s;e walks that the &s;oul, which the &s;cenes of Paris petrified with terror, melted at the view of the &s;oothing land|&s;cape, and that the eye was lifted up to heaven with tears of re&s;ignation mingled with hope. I have no words to paint the &s;trong feeling of reluctance with which I always returned from our walks to Paris, that den of carnage, that &s;laughter-hou&s;e of man. How I envied the pea&s;ant his lonely hut! for I had now almo&s;t lo&s;t the idea of &s;ocial happine&s;s. My di&s;turbed imagination divided the communities of men but into two cla&s;&s;es, the oppre&s;&s;or and the op|pre&s;&s;ed; and peace &s;eemed only to exi&s;t with &s;oli|tude.</P>
<P>On the 15th of Germinal (the beginning of April,) the committee of public &s;afety, or rather of public extermination, cau&s;ed a law to be pa&s;&s;ed, or|dering all the former nobility and &s;trangers to leave Paris within ten days, under the penalty of being put out of the law; which meant, that if found in Paris after that period, they were to be led to the &s;caffold without a trial, as &s;oon as their per&s;ons were identified. This law, to which my family and my|&s;elf were &s;ubject, was a part of the plan of general pro&s;cription that Robe&s;pierre had formed again&s;t no|bles and foreigners; and which he was now impa|tient to put in force. We were ordered by the de|cree, after choo&s;ing the place of our retreat, to pre|&s;ent our&s;elves at the revolutionary committee of our re&s;pective &s;ections, who delivered to each of us not a pa&s;&s;port, but what was called a pa&s;s, on which was written a declaration that we left Paris
<PB N="135" REF="031634_0134_0FED6343935F3A80">
in conformity to the law of the 26th of Germinal. Thus we were condemned to wander into the coun|try with this pa&s;s, which was the mark of Cain up|on our foreheads, and which under pain of impri|&s;onment we were to depo&s;it at the municipality where we bent our cour&s;e; and we were al&s;o con|demned to pre&s;ent our&s;elves every twenty-four hours before the municipality, and in&s;cribe our names on a li&s;t, which was to be di&s;patched every decade to the committee of public &s;afety. And le&s;t the country municipalities &s;hould mi&s;take the intentions of the committee, and treat particular individuals with le|nity upon their producing te&s;timonies of their at|tachment to the cau&s;e of the revolution, the&s;e de|voted victims were ordered by a decree to burn every certificate of civi&s;m of which they might happen to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. We cho&s;e for the place of our re|treat a little village half a mile di&s;tant from Marly, and with hearts overwhelmed with angui&s;h bade adieu to my &s;i&s;ter, who, being married to a French|man, was exempted from the law; and we were once more driven from our home, not to return un|der the penalty of death. Our neighbours came weeping to our gate to take leave of us; and the poor, who were the only cla&s;s which now dared to utter a complaint, murmured loudly at the inju&s;tice of the decree. We were obliged to pa&s;s the &s;quare of the revolution, where we &s;aw the guillotine erect|ed, the crowd a&s;&s;embled for the bloody tragedy, and the gens d'armes on hor&s;eback, followed by vic|tims who were to be &s;acrificed, entering the &s;quare. Such was the daily &s;pectacle which had &s;ucceeded the painted &s;hows, the itinerant theatres, the moun|tebank, the dance, the &s;ong, the &s;hifting &s;cenes of harmle&s;s gaiety, which u&s;ed to attract the cheerful crowd as they pa&s;&s;ed from the Thuilleries to the Champs Eli&s;&eacute;es.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="031634_0135_0FED632455358CD8">
When we reached the barrier we were &s;topped by a concour&s;e of carriages filled with former no|bles, and were obliged to wait till our pa&s;&s;es were examined in our turn. The proce&s;&s;ion at the gate was &s;ingular and affecting. Mo&s;t of the fugitives having, like our&s;elves, deferred their departure till the la&s;t day, and it being the forfeiture of our heads to be found in Paris the day following, the demand for carriages was &s;o great, and the price exacted by tho&s;e who let them out, and who knew the urgency of the ca&s;e, &s;o exorbitant, that a coach or chariot was a luxury which fell only to the lot of a favour|ed few. The greater number were furni&s;hed with cabriolets, which &s;eemed from their tottering con|dition &s;omewhat emblematical of decayed nobility; and many who found even the&s;e crazy vehicles too co&s;tly, journeyed in the carts which tran&s;ported their furniture, &s;eated upon the chairs they were convey|ing to their new abodes.</P>
<P>We reached our little dwelling at the hour of &s;un-&s;et. The hills were fringed with clouds, which &s;till reflected the fading colours of the day; the woods were in deep &s;hadow; a &s;oft veil was thrown over nature, and objects indi&s;tinctly &s;een, were de|corated by imagination with tho&s;e graces which were mo&s;t congenial to the feelings of the moment. The air was full of delicious fragrance, and the &s;tillne&s;s of the &s;cene was only di&s;turbed by &s;ounds the mo&s;t &s;oothing in nature, the &s;oft ru&s;tling of the leaves, or the plaintive notes of the wood-pigeon. The tears which the &s;pectacle of the guillotine had petrified with horror, now flowed again with melan|choly luxury. Our habitation was &s;ituated within a few paces of the noble park of Marly; and the de|&s;erted alleys overgrown with long gra&s;s&mdash;the en|cumbering fragments of rock, over which once fell the mimic ca&s;cades, who&s;e &s;treams no longer mur|mur&mdash;
<PB N="137" REF="031634_0136_0FED624C543D84C0">
the piles of marble which once formed the bed of cry&s;tal ba&s;ons&mdash;the &s;cattered machinery of the jets d'eaux, who&s;e &s;ources are dried&mdash;the fallen &s;tatues&mdash;the defaced &s;ymbols of feudality&mdash;the weeds &s;pringing between the &s;tone &s;teps of the a&s;|cent to the de&s;erted palace&mdash;the cobwebbed win|dows of the gay pavillions, were all in union with that pen&s;ivene&s;s of mind which our pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances naturally excited. And here, where we could &s;ee nothing of Paris but the di&s;tant dome of the Pantheon, we &s;hould have been le&s;s unhappy, if we had not too well known that the committee of public &s;afety had not &s;ent nobles and foreigners into the country to enjoy the fre&s;hne&s;s of rural gales, or the beauty of the opening &s;pring, but as the fir&s;t &s;tep towards a general pro&s;cription; and as we pa&s;&s;|ed every evening through the park of Marly, in order to appear before the municipality, that appal|ling idea "breathed a browner horror over the woods." We were again re&s;cued from the gene|ral danger by the two benevolent commi&s;&s;aries of the revolutionary committee of our &s;ection, who when they came to conduct us to pri&s;on had treated us with &s;o much gentlene&s;s, who had afterwards re|claimed us of the admini&s;tration of police, and who now, un&s;olicited and even una&s;ked, went to the committee of public &s;afety, declared they would an&s;wer for us with their lives, and cau&s;ed us to be put into requi&s;ition; a form which enabled us to re|turn to Paris, and thus &s;natched us from the cla&s;s of the &s;u&s;pected and the pro&s;cribed. To their huma|nity we probably owe our exi&s;tence; and I &s;hall ever recollect with gratitude that noble courage which led them amid&s;t the cruel impul&s;e of revolu|tionary government, the movement of which was accelerated as it went on, to pau&s;e and &s;uccour the unfortunate. I have the &s;atisfaction of adding, that
<PB N="138" REF="031634_0137_0FED624873F6A878">
tho&s;e commi&s;&s;aries are now at liberty on account of their general good conduct, while &s;carcely any other members of revolutionary committees have e&s;caped impri&s;onment. Our benefactors have indeed a right to this honourable exception; who, although appointed the immediate agents of terror, the order of the day, regulated their actions by the eternal code of humanity.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time before our departure from Paris, the guillotine, upon which &s;o many innocent vic|tims had been &s;acrificed, for once &s;treamed with the blood of the guilty:
<Q><L>" The guilty only were of life bereft:</L>
<L>" Alas! the guilty only then were left!"</L>
<BIBL>LUCAN's PHARSALIA.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>One of the &s;ecrets of Robe&s;pierre's government was to employ as the &s;tep-ladders of his ambition men who&s;e characters were marked with opprobri|um, or &s;tained with crimes. Such men were be&s;t &s;uited to his purpo&s;e; &s;ince they were not likely to pau&s;e in the execution of his orders, depending upon his favour, perhaps, for &s;helter from legal puni&s;h|ment; and when they had fulfilled the part he al|lotted them, and he no longer &s;tood in need of their agency, he had &s;ufficient addre&s;s to lead them to make &s;ome extravagant propo&s;ition, which he de|nominated <HI>ultra-revolutionary,</HI> and for which he &s;ent them to the &s;caffold, even with the approbation of the public. Such was the &s;entiment excited by the execution of Hebert, one of the chiefs of the municipality of Paris, who&s;e arre&s;t by the commi&s;|&s;ion of twelve, previou&s;ly to the thirty-fir&s;t of May, had &s;erved the con&s;pirators as the &s;ignal for ringing that fatal toc&s;in which was the knell of liberty. Hebert was the man who upon the trial of Marie
<PB N="139" REF="031634_0138_0FED632185E1B4F0">
Antoinette outraged all the feelings of nature, by an accu&s;ation which wrung from her bur&s;ting heart that affecting appeal to every mother who was pre|&s;ent. It was he who loaded her with the indignity of gro&s;s abu&s;e, and poured the bitterne&s;s of in&s;ult into the cup of death. He &s;oon after acted again at the revolutionary tribunal the part of evidence again&s;t the twenty-one; tho&s;e virtuous patriots, the Sidneys and the Ru&s;&s;els of their country, who&s;e martyrdom has been avenged, not as they wi&s;hed, but as they predicted, by &s;cenes of univer&s;al de&s;ola|tion and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Hebert was commonly called Pere du Che&s;ne, on account of a daily paper he publi&s;hed, bearing that title. In this paper he profe&s;&s;ed to tread in the &s;teps of Marat, and indeed he proved him&s;elf worthy to be his lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;or. He had the &s;ame in&s;atiable thir&s;t of blood; he demanded with the &s;ame vehe|mence the heads of all con&s;pirators, nobles, bank|ers, writers and merchants, the faction of federa|li&s;ts, and the faction of Pitt and Cobourg. Tho&s;e mild demands were breathed in the language of the lowe&s;t vulgar: every line was enforced by an oath, and every period rounded by an imprecation. Ca|mille De&s;moulins, after drawing the character of this journal, concluded by &s;aying that it was writ|ten "pour faire les d&eacute;lices de Coblentz, et le &s;eul e&s;poir de Pitt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To form the delight of Coblentz, and the only hope of Pitt.</NOTE>." Such was Hebert! who having &s;ucceeded with his colleagues of the municipality in accompli&s;hing what they called the revolution of the 31&s;t of May, felt with indignation that his re|volutionary genius was forced to bend before the genius of Robe&s;pierre, and determined to immor|talize the month of Vento&s;e by a new revolution.</P>
<P>They had hitherto met with &s;uch &s;plendid &s;ucce&s;s
<PB N="140" REF="031634_0139_0FED62643B7DD3F0">
in in&s;urrection, that they began to think it was no very difficult enterpri&s;e, now that the routine was known. It was but to ring the toc&s;in, beat the ge|nerale, put the city under arms, take the direction of the military force, overthrow the committee of public &s;afety, and &s;eize the reins of government. The ideas of March, however, proved as fatal to the dominion of the red cap, as they had hereto|fore done to that of the purple robe. In vain He|bert mounted the tribune at the Cordeliers, a&s;&s;erted that tyranny exi&s;ted, and cau&s;ed a black veil to be thrown over the table of the rights of man&mdash;in vain the &s;ection of Marat declared it&s;elf in in&s;urrec|tion: the other &s;ections of Paris were of opinion, that to go from the committee of public &s;afety to the municipality was flying from Scylla to Charyb|dis; and though all France groaned under the ty|ranny of the committee, there was little hope that the wounds of the bleeding country would be healed by men who were the leaders of ma&s;&s;acre, and the preachers of the agrarian law. The Pari|&s;ians therefore applauded the decree which &s;ent Hebert and twenty of his co-adjutors in revolution|ary crimes to that &s;anguinary tribunal, which, af|ter a mockery of trial, ordered them to execution, "and bade the cruel feel the pains they gave." There appeared &s;o much of retribution in the cir|cum&s;tances that attended the death of Hebert and his colleagues, that it &s;eemed as if Heaven were vi&s;ibly &s;tretching forth its arm to puni&s;h the guilty. For it is remarkable enough, that they were not tried for any of the multiplied crimes they had com|mitted, but for having a&s;&s;erted that tyranny exi&s;t|ed: a &s;acred truth which every heart &s;welled to acknowledge, though no lips but theirs had dared to give it utterance.&mdash;The behaviour of Hebert and his a&s;&s;ociates upon the approach of death was
<PB N="141" REF="031634_0140_0FED62735C0D1B48">
far different from that of the innocent &s;ufferers who had con&s;ciences void of reproach. Along tho&s;e &s;ubterraneous galleries where all the light which entered was "darkne&s;s vi&s;ible," terrific phantoms covered with blood &s;eemed to pur&s;ue their &s;teps, and with menacing looks prepare to drag them to aby&s;&s;es of deeper horror: they fancied they &s;aw the headle&s;s trunks of murdered victims encumbering the ground; they heard human groans and &s;hrieks founding hollow through the vaulted pa&s;&s;ages; while the knife of the guillotine, like Macbeth's a&euml;rial dagger, hung &s;u&s;pended before their affrighted ima|gination. Anachar&s;is Clootz, a Pru&s;&s;ian baron and a member of the national convention, known by the title which he conferred upon him&s;elf, of ora|tor of the human race, &s;uffered death with this band of ruffians. He was al&s;o a preacher of blood; but, cruelty being the order of the day, what mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed him from others was not the ferocity of his principles, but the chimeras of his imagination. His publications which were numerous, were always dated "<HI>Paris, chef lieu du globe</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paris, capital of the globe.</NOTE>;" and he &s;eriou&s;ly propo&s;ed, that as &s;oon as all the potentates of the earth were overthrown, an event of which he had a bird's eye view from the beginning of the French revolution, the people of every nation &s;hould &s;end their repre&s;entatives to Paris, who &s;hould be honoured with &s;eats in the na|tional a&s;&s;embly of France, and there form an uni|ver&s;al republic, of which France &s;hould be the cen|tre, and the other kingdoms of the world the de|partments. He propo&s;ed for in&s;tance, that as &s;oon as the deputies of the Engli&s;h nation arrived, Eng|land &s;hould take the name of le departement de la Tami&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The department of the Thames.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="031634_0141_0FED628304CCFD18">
Soon after the memorable 10th of Augu&s;t, Ana|char&s;is marched to the bar of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;em|bly at the head of a number of men he had hired to repre&s;ent the natives of every quarter of the globe; and who were clad in the re&s;pective dre&s;&s;es of the people they per&s;onated. This emba&s;&s;y of the hu|man race declared, by the organ of their common orator Anachar&s;is, their admiration of the French republic, and their attachment to its cau&s;e. The conclu&s;ion of this drama however was le&s;s &s;plen|did than the opening &s;cene at the bar of the con|vention; for the next morning the door of Ana|char&s;is was be&s;et with Italians, Germans, Swedes, Poles, Jews, Turks and Ru&s;&s;ians, clamorou&s;ly de|manding to be paid: but none were more noi&s;y in their vociferations than a Calmuck Tartar, and an Indian of the banks of the Ohio, who menaced their orator with the vengeance of the whole faux|bourg of St. Antoine, if he refu&s;ed to pay them for the lo&s;s of their day's labour, and the hire of their dre&s;&s;es. Anachar&s;is, after much altercation, came to a compromi&s;e with the deputation of the human race, who departed not very well &s;atisfied with their Champion.&mdash;Clootz met death with more firmne&s;s than might have been expected from his general character, and his athei&s;tical principles. Hebert and his colleagues pa&s;&s;ed their time, when together, like the fallen &s;pirits in Milton, in mu|tual accu&s;ation, till Clootz with a loud voice recited to them tho&s;e well known lines:
<Q><L>Je revois cette nuit, que de mal con&s;um&eacute;,</L>

<P>The death of Hebert was the &s;ignal for throw|ing off the hideous ma&s;querade of &s;an&s;culotti&s;m, in which all the world had been arrayed during the winter, in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive deference to his interpreta|tion of equality. Immediately after his execution, the &s;cene &s;uddenly changed: black wigs, red caps, &s;ailor's jackets, and pantaloons were ca&s;t a&s;ide; and the eye was refre&s;hed with the &s;ight of combed locks, clean linen, and decent apparel;&mdash;while the women, who for &s;ome months had reluctantly bound up their hair beneath the round cap of the pea&s;ant, now unfolded their tre&s;&s;es, perfumed and powdered, to the vernal gales, and decorated in whatever man|ner they thought proper, provided the national cockade formed one of their ornaments.</P>

<P>THE execution of Hebert and his colleagues was &s;oon followed by that of a con&s;iderable num|ber of the mountain deputies, among whom were Danton and Camille De&s;moulins, names not un|known to fame in the annals of the revolution. Danton had acted a di&s;tingui&s;hed part on the po|litical theatre, before Robe&s;pierre had been heard of; and Camille De&s;moulins, on the day preceding the taking of the Ba&s;tille, had the glory of being the fir&s;t man in France who placed the national cockade in his hat, and called upon his fellow-citi|zens
<PB N="144" REF="031634_0143_0FED62A05CA45620">
to &s;hake off the fetters of de&s;poti&s;m. And &s;urely it was glorious to be a leader of the revolu|tion; for, although the &s;un of liberty, like the orb of day when &s;een through oppo&s;ing mi&s;ts, has been turned into blood, its dawning beams were radiant, and it will again &s;hake off the foul vapours that have hung around it, and &s;pread that in&s;ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ied light which exhilarates all nature.</P>
<P>Robe&s;pierre was not deterred from marking Dan|ton and Camille De&s;moulins as his victims, by the con&s;ideration that Danton had &s;aved him at the mo|ment when Louvet's repre&s;entation of his crimes on the 2d of September had &s;o &s;trongly excited the indignation of the convention, that a decree of ac|cu&s;ation was on the point of being hurled again&s;t him; and that Camille De&s;moulins had been his &s;chool-fellow and his friend. But the tyrant felt that Danton was too "near the throne;" and Ca|mille De&s;moulins had awakened all his fury by an appeal which he made to the people, in a paper called the "Old Cordelier," and which found an echo in every heart. The exce&s;&s;ive &s;everity of the revolutionary law again&s;t the &s;u&s;pected had excited De&s;moulin's indignation; and in a happy parallel between the capricious tyrannies of the Roman em|perors and tho&s;e of the committees of government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, No. IV.</NOTE>, he expanded the glowing preci&s;ion of Tacitus into charges &s;o extremely ludicrous, that they honoured lord Shafte&s;bury's axiom, that ridicule is the te&s;t of truth. This publication made &s;ome atonement to humanity for the mi&s;chiefs which his former writ|ing, had produced; above all, that cruel plea&s;antry upon the party of the Gironde, on which their act of accu&s;ation was founded. The atonement came too late; tyranny was e&s;tabli&s;hed; and Camille

De&s;moulins peri&s;hed, to u&s;e his own words, "for having &s;hed one tear over the unhappy."</P>
<P>Several other deputies &s;uffered at the &s;ame time; and Camille De&s;moulins ob&s;erved when he was go|ing to the &s;caffold, "Robe&s;pierre fait des coups perc&eacute;s de la convention," alluding to the mode of cutting down the fore&s;ts in France by portions, which are marked to be hewn at certain periods. The per&s;on mo&s;t regretted among the deputies who now peri&s;hed was Philipeaux, who having been &s;ent on a mi&s;&s;ion to the Vend&eacute;e, made known at his re|turn the horrors of which he had been a witne&s;s, and was dragged to the &s;caffold for having dared to lift up the veil which the con&s;pirators had thrown over their crimes. Fabre d'Eglantine, who had been one of the founders of the revolutionary government and auxiliary of Robe&s;pierre, peri&s;hed unlament|ed. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed fine talents for literature, and had written a celebrated comedy, entitled Philinthe. It was ob&s;erved, that he had carried the &s;pirit of in|trigue which prevailed in his comedy into the part he had acted as legi&s;lator. The love of fame, the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion of authors, he felt &s;trong in death; and all his thoughts &s;eemed fixed upon a comedy of five acts, which he had depo&s;ited at the committee of public &s;afety, and of which he was afraid Bil|laud Varennes would take the credit. Fabre d'Eg|lantine was al&s;o the author of the new French ca|lendar. Danton, while at the Conciergerie, often conver&s;ed with the pri&s;oners acro&s;s the bars of his dungeon. He &s;eemed a&s;hamed of having been duped by Robe&s;pierre, with whom, by means of a com|mon friend, he had an interview a few days before he was arre&s;ted, in order that they might come to an explanation. Danton, after a long conver&s;ation, finding that he was unable to move the implacable Robe&s;pierre, who li&s;tened to him with a look of
<PB N="146" REF="031634_0145_0FED6284AFBDFC20">
in&s;ulting malignity, &s;hed &s;ome tears, and left the room, &s;aying, "Je vois que mon &s;ort e&s;t d&eacute;cid&eacute;, mais ma mort &s;era votre ruine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I &s;ee that my fare is decided, but my death will be your ruin.'</NOTE>." This prediction was fulfilled; for no &s;ooner had Robe&s;pierre rid him|&s;elf of all his rivals than he pre&s;&s;ed forward with a more rapid cour&s;e towards his own de&s;truction. Dan|ton in his dungeon expatiated continually on the charms of nature, on the beauties of rural &s;cenery, and the peace of rural &s;hades. "In revolutions," cried he, "the power always remains in the hands of vil|lains. It is better to be a poor fi&s;herman than to go|vern men. Tho&s;e fools! they will cry 'Long live the republic!' on &s;eeing me pa&s;s to the &s;caffold.&mdash;This day la&s;t year I cau&s;ed the revolutionary tribunal to be in&s;tituted. I a&s;k pardon of God and of men; it was not that it &s;hould become the &s;courge of humanity; it was to prevent the renewal of the ma&s;&s;acres of Sep|tember." Camille De&s;moulins and Danton, who had both po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable powers of eloquence, defended them&s;elves at the tribunal with &s;o lofty a &s;pirit, and treated their judges with &s;o much di&s;|dain, that at length irritated by their contempt and the &s;allies of their wit, and impatient at their per|&s;everance in vindicating them&s;elves when it was determined they &s;hould die, the public accu&s;er &s;ent a letter to the convention, informing them that the pri&s;oners were in a &s;tate of revolt again&s;t the tribu|nal. The committee of public &s;afety cau&s;ed a de|cree to be pa&s;&s;ed which put them out of the law, and &s;ent in&s;tantly to execution all &s;uch of the accu&s;ed as dared to in&s;ult their judges. In vain Danton called upon Barrere, upon Billaud Varennes, and upon other members of the committee of public &s;afety to appear in evidence. Danton was left to
<PB N="147" REF="031634_0146_0FED625FC5F92CC0">
his fate, and &s;ent with his colleagues to execution. At the gate of the Conciergerie, while the execu|tioner was placing the condemned deputies in the carts, Danton amu&s;ed the crowd who were looking on by many &s;portive ob&s;ervations. He &s;aid to Fa|bre d'Eglantine, who was a poet, "Eh bien, nous deviendrons tous poetes, nous allons tous faire des vers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An equivoque on the word <HI>vers,</HI> which in French &s;ignifies worm, as well as ver&s;es.</NOTE>." On his way to the &s;caffold his head was bare, and many per&s;ons were &s;truck with its re&s;em|blance to the medals of Socrates. He behaved with remarkable firmne&s;s, conver&s;ing with tho&s;e who were placed in the &s;ame ca&s;t, and &s;ometimes an&s;wering the cries of the populace by looks of &s;trong indignation. When he was tied to the plank he ca&s;t his eyes upwards to the fatal knife, and his countenance and figure a&s;&s;umed an expre&s;&s;ion of magnanimity with which the &s;pectators were deeply penetrated.</P>

A week after the death of Camille De&s;moulins, his wife, a charming woman of twenty-three years of age, was led to the &s;caffold. For her fate no eye except tho&s;e of her barbarous judges refu&s;ed a tear. Her execution forms an epocha in the annals of the revolutionary government; &s;ince on that occa&s;ion, for the fir&s;t time, a con&s;piracy &s;uppo&s;ed in a pri&s;on became the pretext for murder, and multitudes af|terwards peri&s;hed the victims of that fatal inven|tion. Camille De&s;moulins was in habits of friend|&s;hip with Arthur Dillon, an Iri&s;h general, who had bravely defended the pa&s;s in the fore&s;t of Argonne again&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ian army, and who held the highe&s;t rank in the &s;ervice of the republic. Soon after the the 31&s;t of May, he was arre&s;ted with multitudes <HI>&s;oup&ccedil;onn&eacute;s d'&ecirc;tre &s;u&s;pects</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon a <HI>&s;u&s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI> of being <HI>&s;u&s;pected.</HI></NOTE>, and was confined in the pri&s;on of the Luxembourg. His hopes of regain|ing his liberty re&s;ted upon the influence of his friend Camille De&s;moulins, and he was deeply affected by the intelligence of his being &s;ent to the revolutionary tribunal. In his affliction he made u&s;e of &s;ome imprudent expre&s;&s;ions to a fellow pri&s;oner, and &s;eemed to flatter him&s;elf with the hope that the people would not &s;uffer &s;uch a patriot as De&s;moulins to peri&s;h. The wretch to whom Dil|lon confided the&s;e &s;entiments had the atrocity to write a denunciation again&s;t him to the committee of general &s;afety, with the view of purcha&s;ing his own freedom by the life of his unfortunate compa|nion. Dillon had al&s;o, a few days before De&s;|moulins peri&s;hed, written a letter to his wife, ex|pre&s;&s;ing his &s;ympathy in her misfortunes, and his hope that the innocence of her hu&s;band would yet triumph. In this letter Dillon enclo&s;ed three thou|&s;and livres. All the&s;e circum&s;tances were made known to the committee; and a few days after the
<PB N="149" REF="031634_0148_0FED62DD8B9DD4C8">
execution of De&s;moulins, Dillon, the turnkey to whom he had offered the letter, and Madame De&s;|moulins in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of grief upon the lo&s;s of a hu&s;band whom &s;he tenderly loved, were &s;ent by an order of the committee to the Concier|gerie to take their trial at the revolutionary tribu|nal. It appeared upon the trial that the turnkey had refu&s;ed to take the letter; upon which Dillon had &s;lipt it into his pocket; which the turnkey perceiving, returned it to him immediately, and Dillon tore it in pieces. Madame De&s;moulins, it was therefore clear, had never received the letter or the three thou&s;and livres enclo&s;ed. She an|&s;wered the interrogatories of her judges with the candour of innocence, and the &s;weet complacency of her manner &s;en&s;ibly affected the &s;pectators. Tho&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins in the robes of ju&s;tice condemned Dillon to die as the author of a con&s;piracy in the pri&s;ons again&s;t the &s;ecurity of the French people; the turnkey was &s;ent to death for having had &s;uffi|cient humanity not to make a declaration to the police of Dillon's propo&s;ition re&s;pecting the letter; and the unfortunate Madame De&s;moulins was dragged to the &s;caffold becau&s;e a letter was written to her which it was clearly proved had never been &s;ent. In the fir&s;t angui&s;h of &s;eparation from the object of our affections, death cea&s;es to be an evil; and Madame De&s;moulins deplored her hu&s;band too tenderly to regret that they were going to be re|united in a happier &s;tate of exi&s;tence. She dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in white, and with &s;ome care; and went with a placid &s;mile upon her countenance to exe|tion, conver&s;ing with her companions in the cart, particularly with the wife of Hebert, who was put to death at the &s;ame time, and met her fate with equal firmne&s;s. It was one of the &s;ingular chances of the&s;e revolutionary moments, that Camille De&s;|moulins

who with the pointed &s;hafts of his wit had overthrown the idol of the populace Hebert, peri&s;hed him&s;elf but a fortnight later; and that his own wife and the wife of Hebert, &s;eated on the &s;ame &s;tone in the Conciergere, deplored their mu|tual lo&s;s, and were led together to the &s;caffold. The people, as Madame De&s;moulins pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treets to execution, could not re&s;i&s;t uttering exclamations of pity and admiration. "Comme elle e&s;t belle! elle a l'air &s;i doux! quel dommage qu'elle va p&eacute;rir<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"How beautiful &s;he is! how mild &s;he looks! what a pity &s;he &s;hould peri&s;h!"</NOTE>!" At the foot of the &s;caffold &s;he embraced the wife of Hebert, bade her compa|nions in the cart farewell, and re&s;igned her&s;elf to the executioner with the &s;erenity of an angel. Dillon went to death with great compo&s;ure, and, as he pa&s;&s;ed to execution, bowed to a friend of his and mine whom he &s;aw in the &s;treet. Far differ|ent from the meek and placid re&s;ignation with which Madame De&s;moulins made the &s;acrifice of life in all its bloom and fre&s;hne&s;s, was the behaviour of Chaumette procureur of the commune, and Go|bet the archbi&s;hop of Paris, who peri&s;hed at the &s;ame time. Their a&s;pect te&s;tified that death ap|peared to their perturbed &s;pirits, not in the form he wears to &s;uffering innocence, to whom he comes the me&s;&s;enger of peace, but armed with all his &s;tings, and clad in all his terrors.</P>

And Gobet, the archbi&s;hop

of Paris, a weak old man, whom Chaumette and Anachar&s;is Clootz had per&s;uaded to go with the municipality to the bar of the convention, and at &s;ixty-&s;even years of age declare that the profe&s;&s;ion of his life had been impo&s;ture, that he renounced the chri&s;tian faith and his eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignity, and demanded that the churches con&s;ecrated to re|ligious wor&s;hip &s;hould henceforth become the tem|ples of Rea&s;on, was puni&s;hed for his apo&s;tacy with death. Robe&s;pierre embraced the new doc|trine till the church was de&s;poiled of all the trea|&s;ures with which &s;uper&s;tition had enriched it, and &s;oon after aboli&s;hed the <HI>decadary</HI> fea&s;ts of the god|de&s;s Rea&s;on, and &s;ent her high prie&s;ts Gobet and Chaumette to the guillotine. One of the few in|&s;tances of fortitude in death exemplified by per&s;ons who had neither the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of innocence nor the &s;entiment of &s;ympathy to &s;ooth their minds in &s;o &s;evere a trial, was that of the former duke of Orleans, in who&s;e life nothing was worthy of ap|plau&s;e except his manner of leaving it. The re|membrance of the vote he had given again&s;t his unfortunate relation Lewis XVI. from motives of per&s;onal vengeance and ambition, could not but gnaw upon his heart, and depre&s;s his &s;pirit, and mu&s;t have been mingled not only with a feeling of indignation again&s;t the wretches who made him &s;uffer upon fal&s;e pretences, but with all the angui&s;h of remor&s;e for having joined their party; by which act of deba&s;ement he had incurred not only guilt, but its &s;peedy puni&s;hment. Yet notwith&s;tanding &s;uch reflections could not fail to embitter his la&s;t moments, he went to execution with a calm dig|nity worthy of a better mind. Nor did he gratify the populace by betraying any emotion when the cart in which he was placed &s;topped for ten mi|nutes before the gate of the Palais-Royal, the &s;cene

<P>Among the crowds who were led to the guillo|tine, two per&s;ons only di&s;played &s;trong marks of di&s;may and terror. One of the&s;e per&s;ons was Ma|dame du Barry, the mi&s;tre&s;s of Lewis XV. She had been induced to leave England, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time after the revolution, and return to France, in order to &s;ecure her property; and &s;oon after the 31 of May was led from her beau|tiful pavillion at Lucienne, to a pri&s;on in Paris, by one of the agents of <HI>terrori&s;m,</HI> who, I am &s;orry to add, was an Engli&s;hman. The pri&s;ons, to u&s;e a French mode of expre&s;&s;ion, in a &s;hort time became the anti-chambers of the &s;caffold; and Madame du Barry's mind was impre&s;&s;ed &s;trongly with a pre&s;age of her fate. Whenever the door of her chamber
<PB N="154" REF="031634_0153_0FED628C6C0BFC58">
in the pri&s;on opened, &s;he was &s;eized with violent trembling, and &s;ometimes with fainting fits. At length the fatal &s;ummons to the revolutionary tri|bunal arrived. The chief evidence again&s;t her was a negro &s;lave, whom &s;he had reared from an infant, and to whom &s;he was &s;o much attached, that he was generally to be found in her apart|ments; and one day Lewis XV. &s;portively cre|ated him governor of Lucienne, with a pen&s;ion of &s;ix hundred livers a year, which this viper, who &s;tung the bo&s;om that cheri&s;hed him, &s;till en|joys.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t flagrant te&s;timonies which were produced of Madame du Barry's counter-revolutionary principles was Mr. Pitt's picture, which &s;he &s;aid had been given to her the night before her departure from London by Lord Thur|low. This unfortunate woman was condemned to die; and a per&s;on of my acquaintance who was at that time a pri&s;oner in the Conciergerie told me, that &s;he was deluded with the promi&s;e of pardon provided &s;he would di&s;cover the &s;pot where &s;he ac|knowledged that &s;ome trea&s;ures were concealed; but no &s;ooner were they found, than &s;he was or|dered to execution. During her pa&s;&s;age thither &s;he appeared almo&s;t dead, and leaned her head upon the &s;houlder of the executioner. But when &s;he reached the &s;quare of the revolution, the &s;ight of the in&s;trument of death rallied her &s;inking &s;pirits, and called forth the mo&s;t cruel agonies of reluc|tant nature. She rent the air with her &s;hrieks, and was deaf to the expo&s;tulations of Noil, a de|puty of the Gironde who peri&s;hed at the &s;ame time, and who encouraged her to re&s;ign her&s;elf to a fate which was inevitable. Her convul&s;ed frame ac|quired extraordinary &s;trength: &s;he &s;truggled with her executioners, and, after a conflict at which
<PB N="155" REF="031634_0154_0FED6294E4E0CFA8">
humanity &s;hudders, was forced to undergo the fatal &s;troke, and relea&s;ed from frantic de&s;peration.</P>
<P>With Madame du Barry peri&s;hed the banker Vanderuyver, and his two &s;ons, accu&s;ed of being her accomplices in &s;ending money into England, and al&s;o of having aided the knights of the poniard, as they were called, in the chateau of the Thuil|leries on the memorable 10th of Augu&s;t, although twenty-five witne&s;&s;es attended to prove that Van|deruyver had not quitted his hou&s;e during the whole of that day. But tho&s;e who fir&s;t appeared in his favour being arre&s;ted as they went out of court, the others made their e&s;cape, and left this unhappy fa|mily to their fate.</P>
<P>Their real crime was their great wealth, which it was thought expedient to &s;eize, On this account bankers were the objects of particular pro&s;cription: for although the great revolutionary financier Cam|bon had one day called them all together, and fa|voured them with an harangue of con&s;iderable length upon the value of paper money, and the worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s of gold, which he a&s;&s;erted every real lover of his country ought to de&s;pi&s;e as dro&s;s, and of which he exhorted them to rid them&s;elves as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; it was feared that in &s;pite of this pre|cious mor&s;el of eloquence, an ob&s;tinate attachment to metallic coin &s;till lurked in the hearts of the bankers, who were for the mo&s;t part puni&s;hed for this groveling predilection with death. Of this number was Laborde, once the banker of the court, and now guilty of a revenue of two millions of livres. This re&s;pectable old man was dragged to the &s;caffold at &s;eventy-&s;ix years of age, although &s;ince the fir&s;t epocha of the revolution he had given un|que&s;tionable proofs of his attachment to its cau&s;e, and the magnificence of his donations were more than proportionate to his wealth. His fir&s;t patrio|tic
<PB N="156" REF="031634_0155_0FED6311B99512D8">
gift was twenty thou&s;and louis; he had &s;ent all the fine hor&s;es with which his &s;tables were filled to the municipality; he had lodged troops of na|tional guards at his hou&s;e; and above all, he had been the father of the country where his fine &s;eat of Meriville was placed. The year before his death I had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome very agreeable days at that noble man&s;ion, where &s;trangers properly recommended were received and entertained with the mo&s;t &s;plen|did ho&s;pitality. The plea&s;ure-grounds had been formed in a flat &s;ituation unfavourable to beauty. With immen&s;e labour and expence pa&s;toral hills aro&s;e, and jutting rocks hung over cry&s;tal waters, or were worn into fragments by the fall of lavi&s;h ca&s;cades. A beautiful Grecian temple reared its Corinthian pillars upon a broad green a&s;cent, and amid&s;t the deep rece&s;&s;es of &s;preading oaks a monu|ment was erected to Captain Cook. Perhaps the decorated &s;cenes of Meriville are &s;omewhat too richly hung with ornaments, but in creating this blooming Eden, which was the work of years, Mon&s;. Laborde had given employment to the whole country. For a great extent of &s;pace round his dwelling no wants were felt which his munificence was not eager to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eve; and when the eye &s;aw him, it ble&s;&s;ed him. Nor was the good he con|ferred confined to the precincts of his own po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions. The Paris markets were often &s;upplied with &s;uch articles of living as were mo&s;t wanted, at the very time when its owner was langui&s;hing in pri&s;on. With tears and lamentations his tenants heard of his confinement. Whole villages and mu|nicipalities crowded to the bar of the convention, and claimed the enlargment of their common be|nefactor, but in vain. The rich &s;poils of his cha|teau were too tempting to be re&s;i&s;ted, the &s;eizure of his immen&s;e property was an expedient of fi|nance,
<PB N="157" REF="031634_0156_0FED62C378AE73C8">
and as a preliminary &s;tep to its confi&s;cation he was put to death.</P>
<P>I have mentioned among the multitudes who peri&s;hed, that Madame du Barry and one other per&s;on only were remarked for having betrayed &s;ymptoms of weakne&s;s and terror in their la&s;t mo|ments. You will be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that this per&s;on was general Cu&s;tine.</P>
<LG>
<L>Who combats bravely is not therefore brave:</L>
<L>He fears a death-bed like the meane&s;t &s;lave.</L>
</LG>
<P>This unfortunate general, although accu&s;tomed to look upon death with intrepidity in the ranks of battle, &s;hrunk from it in a form of horror for which he was unprepared. His &s;on, an amiable and accompli&s;hed young man, who &s;uffered a few months after as the accomplice of his father, be|cau&s;e he had given proofs of filial affection, be|haved with admirable courage. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe a letter which he &s;ent to his wife on the day of his execution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, No. V.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This intere&s;ting young woman had the courage, during the trial of her father-in-law the general, to &s;it at his feet at the tribunal, to wipe the damps from his brow, to animate his failing &s;pirits, and calm the agitation of his mind by her &s;oothing at|tentions. After &s;eeing her hu&s;band dragged to the &s;caffold, &s;he was thrown into pri&s;on, from which &s;he was one of the la&s;t per&s;ons relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Early in the &s;pring Madame Elizabeth was brought before the revolutionary tribunal. The only crime that could be imputed to her was that &s;he was the &s;i&s;ter of a king, and had &s;hewn that &s;tedfa&s;t fidelity to her brother, which in generous
<PB N="158" REF="031634_0157_0FED629995E1A388">
minds, whatever might be their political opinions, would have excited &s;entiments of e&s;teem and admi|ration. She had taken no part in tho&s;e fatal &s;chemes of crooked policy, which, by &s;eeking to &s;eize once more that de&s;potic power which the will of a migh|ty nation had torn from its gra&s;p, lo&s;t that limited empire, and that circum&s;cribed dominion of which it might &s;till have held po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But whatever were the errors of Louis XVI. or the vices of Marie Antoinette, no blame was by any party im|puted to the prince&s;s Elizabeth. She had neither &s;hared in the intrigues or the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the court. All that was known of her in pro&s;perity was her virtuous manners, and her charitable di&s;|po&s;ition; and in adver&s;ity, her un&s;haken friend&s;hip for her brother, and her piety and re&s;ignation to God. She had &s;uffered not only the mo&s;t &s;evere extremes of calamity, but all tho&s;e indignities, wants, and hard&s;hips, which could give misfortune a keener edge; for, during the tyranny of Robe|&s;pierre, the forms of decency which had till then been ob&s;erved were altogether di&s;regarded. She, who had been u&s;ed to the long train of attendants of the mo&s;t &s;plendid court of Europe, was com|pelled to perform the mo&s;t menial offices her&s;elf; to dre&s;s her &s;canty meal, and to &s;weep the floor of her pri&s;on. In &s;uch circum&s;tances, with no ray of hope to cheer the gloomy towers where &s;he was immured, except that hope which was fixed on a better &s;tate of exi&s;tence&mdash;&s;he probably looked upon death as her mo&s;t &s;oothing refuge, and therefore met it with tranquillity and firmne&s;s. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe her examination at the revolutionary tri|bunal, not only as a proof of the calmne&s;s and dig|nity with which &s;he an&s;wered the interrogatories of her barbarous judges, but al&s;o as a &s;pecimen of the manner in which the trials at this &s;anguinary court
<PB N="159" REF="031634_0158_0FED63136DA78FA0">
were conducted even before the period arrived when all enquiry, all form was laid a&s;ide.</P>

But what you will not be able to deny is the active part which you took in the action that happened between the patriots, and the &s;atellites of tyranny. It was your zeal and your eagerne&s;s to &s;erve the enemies of the people, which made you provide them with bullets, which you took pains your&s;elf to chew, as they were to be fired again&s;t patriots, and de&s;tined to mow them down.

<PB N="163" REF="031634_0162_0FED6328494127E8">
only towards the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of the people, and that you have all the &s;avagene&s;s of the mo&s;t blood-thir&s;ty bea&s;ts towards the defenders of liberty. So far were you from giving any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the la&s;t, that you provoked the ma&s;&s;acre by your applau&s;es: &s;o far were you from di&s;arming the murderers of the people, that you lavi&s;hed on them handfulls of in&s;truments of death, by means of which you flat|tered your&s;elf, you and your accomplices, with the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of de&s;poti&s;m and tyranny. Here is the humanity of the rulers of nations, who have at all times &s;acrificed mankind to their caprice, their ambition, or their avarice.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner Elizabeth, who&s;e defence con&s;i&s;ts in denying every charge brought again&s;t her, will &s;he be hone&s;t enough to agree that &s;he has fed little Capet with hopes of &s;ucceeding to his father's throne, and that by the&s;e means &s;he has provoked to royalty?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elizabeth.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have conver&s;ed familiarly with that unfortunate child, who is dear to me on more than one account; and I gave him all tho&s;e con|&s;olations which appeared to me likely to reconcile him to the lo&s;s of tho&s;e who had given him birth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Court.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is &s;aying in other words, that you fed little Capet with tho&s;e projects of vengeance which you and yours have never cea&s;ed forming again&s;t liberty, and that you flattered your&s;elf with building up again the wrecks of a broken throne by deluging it with the blood of the patriots."&mdash;Here the trial ended, no witne&s;&s;es were called, and the pri&s;oner was condemned without farther exa|mination.</P>
<P>Madame Elizabeth betrayed &s;ome emotion at the &s;ight of the guillotine; but &s;he recovered her|&s;elf immediately, and waited calmly at the foot of the &s;caffold, till twenty-five per&s;ons who peri&s;hed
<PB N="164" REF="031634_0163_0FED62FDD4DC64A0">
with her were put to death, her former rank being &s;till &s;ufficiently remembered to give her a title to pre-eminence in puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Sometimes amid&s;t the&s;e horrors, the mo&s;t ludi|crous violations of the laws of nations took place; and we might have &s;miled at the ab&s;urdities of our tyrants, if they had been mingled with le&s;s atrocity. The revolutionary committee of Cette, in the de|partment of Harault, with a noble defiance of all ordinary forms and ob&s;ervances, thought fit to put in requi&s;ition not only &s;ome mules belonging to the con&s;ul of a northern court, and a cart which was his property, but the con&s;ul him&s;elf to be their driver. The requi&s;ition was &s;igned by William Tell, Brutus, Marat, Cato, and Ce&s;ar. Whether the con&s;ul was of opinion, that &s;uch great names were not to be trifled with, or whether he thought that driving mules was a &s;afer occupation than con|tending with tigers, is uncertain; but it is well known that he &s;ubmitted him&s;elf with pa&s;&s;ive obe|dience to this &s;ans-culotte edict, till the 9th of Thermidor; after which period he &s;ent to Paris to complain of the indignity he had &s;uffered, and de|manded the cha&s;tizement of William Tell and his colleagues.</P>

<P>IT would require the pencil of a ma&s;ter to trace in all its dark colouring that picture of calamity and horror which Paris pre&s;ented at this period. A deep and &s;ilent gloom pervaded that city, where heretofore every heart bounded with gaiety, and eve|ry

eye &s;parkled with delight. The citizens in ge|neral &s;aw with &s;tupefied terror tho&s;e proce&s;&s;ions of death which daily encumbered the &s;treets, and the feelings of &s;ympathy and indignation were repelled by the &s;en&s;e of that per&s;onal danger from which no individual was &s;ecure. Even in his own habitation, and in the bo&s;om of his family, no man dared to utter a complaint but in anxious whi&s;pers, le&s;t a &s;ervant &s;hould over-hear the forbidden expo&s;tula|tions of humanity, and denounce him as a counter-revolutioni&s;t. Many per&s;ons wearied of &s;pectacles of horror put an end to their exi&s;tence; and &s;ome who de&s;ired to die, but &s;hrunk from giving them|&s;elves the &s;troke of death, took mea&s;ures to be &s;ent before the revolutionary tribunal, where they knew a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were ever ready. The u&s;ual means em|ployed for this purpo&s;e was the cry of "Vive le <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oi!" words which many young women who had lo&s;t their parents or their lovers on the &s;caffold re|peated in the phren&s;y of de&s;pair, and found them, as they wi&s;hed, a pa&s;&s;port to the tomb. Well might the people of France have exclaimed in the words of our divine poet,</P>
<P>"Alas poor country, almo&s;t afraid to know it|&s;elf! It cannot be called our mother, but our grave, where nothing, but who knows nothing, is once &s;een to &s;mile; where &s;ighs and groans and &s;hrieks that rend the air are made, not marked where vio|lent &s;orrow &s;eems a modern ec&s;ta&s;y: the dead man's knell is there &s;carce a&s;ked for whom; and good men's lives expire before the flowers in their caps, dying or ere they &s;icken."&mdash;MACBETH.</P>
<P>The beginning of the month of Prairial, a man of the name of Admiral formed the de&s;ign of a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inating Robe&s;pierre and Collot d'Herbois: he fail|ed in the attempt, was &s;eized, and &s;ent to the Con|ciergerie. A few days after Am&eacute;e Cecile Renaud,
<PB N="166" REF="031634_0165_0FED62684840A008">
a girl of nineteen years of age, who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility it appears was &s;ingularly affected by the &s;cenes which were pa&s;&s;ing before her, and who&s;e imagina|tion perhaps was &s;omewhat di&s;ordered by tho&s;e ter|rible impre&s;&s;ions, had the courage, while an armed nation bowed before its a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, to enter alone and unarmed the mon&s;ter's den, and, as it would &s;eem, with the intention, at the expence of life, to point out to her countrymen the tyrant under whom they groaned. Cecile Renaud went one morning to Robe&s;pierre's hou&s;e, and enquired if he was at home. She was an&s;wered in the negative; and being a&s;ked what &s;he wanted, replied that &s;he came to &s;ee what &s;ort of thing was a tyrant. Upon this declaration &s;he was in&s;tantly led to the committee of general &s;afety, and went through a long examination. She again declared with the &s;ame &s;implicity, that &s;he had only gone becau&s;e &s;he wanted to &s;ee a tyrant; and upon being &s;earched, no offen&s;ive weapon was found upon her, and all that was contained in a little bundle which &s;he held under her arm was a change of linen, with which &s;he &s;aid &s;he had provided her&s;elf, knowing &s;he &s;hould want it in pri&s;on. The conduct of this heroic young woman furni&s;hed the tyrants with an oppor|tunity of murder too favourable to be neglected. They in&s;tantly proclaimed that a va&s;t plan of con|&s;piracy again&s;t the lives of tho&s;e renowned patriots Collot d'Herbois and Robe&s;pierre had been formed by traitors within the pri&s;ons, and traitors without.</P>
<P>The father, mother and aunt of Cecile Renaud were led with her&s;elf to the Conciergerie, where &s;he was again interrogated, and threatened that her whole family &s;hould peri&s;h with her, if &s;he did not confe&s;s her intention of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Robe&s;pierre. She repeated what &s;he had &s;aid at the committee; and added, that they might put her to death if they
<PB N="167" REF="031634_0166_0FED634661EE9988">
thought proper, but, if &s;he de&s;erved to die, it was not for any intention to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate, but for her anti-republican &s;entiments. Cecile Renaud, who was very young and hand&s;ome, was dre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome care, and perhaps coquetry. Her appearance led her &s;avage judges to invent a new &s;pecies of que&s;|tion in order to bring her to confe&s;&s;ion. By their directions &s;he was &s;tripped of her own clothes, and covered with &s;qualid and di&s;gu&s;ting rags, in which condition &s;he was made to appear in the council-chamber and undergo a new interrogatory, where the &s;ame menaces were repeated, and where &s;he an&s;wered as &s;he had done before; and with great &s;pirit rallied her judges upon the ab&s;urdity of trying to &s;hake her purpo&s;e by a mode of puni&s;hment &s;o contemptible. Notwith&s;tanding no proof of any in|tention to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Robe&s;pierre could be brought again&s;t her, &s;he together with her whole family was put to death. Her two brothers, who were fight|ing the battles of the republic on the frontiers, were ordered to be conducted to Paris, that they might &s;hare her fate; but the tyrants were too im|patient for blood to wait their arrival, and owing to this circum&s;tance they e&s;caped.</P>
<P>With Cecile Renaud peri&s;hed not only her own family, but &s;ixty-nine per&s;ons were brought from different parts and different pri&s;ons of Paris, who had never &s;een or heard of each other till they met at the Conciergerie, and were together dragged be|fore the tribunal, and declared guilty of one com|mon con&s;piracy. Their trial only la&s;ted a &s;uffici|ent length of time to call over their names; none of them were permitted to make any defence; the jury declared them&s;elves &s;atisfied in their &s;ouls and con&s;ciences; and the devoted victims, covered with the red cloaks worn by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins on their way to ex|ecution were led to death. Among tho&s;e who pe|ri&s;hed

on this occa&s;ion were madame Sainte Ama|ranthe, her daughter, who had married Mon&s;ieur Sartine the &s;on of the ex-mini&s;ter, and who was now only in her nineteenth year, and one of the mo&s;t beautiful women in France, and her brother, who was but &s;eventeen years of age. A friend of mine was confined in the &s;ame pri&s;on with this family. A &s;ervant from the out&s;ide of the walls had made madame Sainte Amaranthe under&s;tand by &s;igns that her &s;on-in-law, who had been confined in another pri&s;on, had peri&s;hed, and that &s;he her&s;elf was in danger. She went immediately to her daughter, and &s;aid to her, "Your hu&s;band is no more, and it is very probable that we &s;hall follow him to-morrow to the &s;caffold&mdash;No tears&mdash;this is no time for &s;oft|ne&s;s&mdash;we mu&s;t prepare to meet with courage a fate that is inevitable." The next day pa&s;&s;ed, and no &s;ummons to the Conciergerie arrived; but on the night following at eleven o'clock a hui&s;&s;ier entered madame Sainte Amaranthe's chamber, and told her &s;he was wanted below. The call was well under|&s;tood. "And are not we too wanted?" cried her &s;on and daughter. "Certainly," an&s;wered the hui&s;&s;ier. They both flew to their mother, threw their arms round her neck, and exclaimed, "We &s;hall die together!" The next day they peri&s;hed. Fouquier Tainville, the public accu&s;er, that mon|&s;ter, "horribly trick'd with blood of fathers, mo|thers, daughters, &s;ons, bak'd and impa&s;ted with the parching &s;treets," placed him&s;elf at a window of the Conciergerie clo&s;e to the gate through which the pri&s;oners pa&s;&s;ed, in order to a&s;cend the carts which were to carry them to execution. There he fea&s;t|ed his atrocious &s;oul with the &s;ight of &s;ixty-nine victims, covered with a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in's cloaks; and ob&s;erv|ing among them &s;ome young women, particularly the lovely madame Sartine, walking towards the

vehicles of death with that firmne&s;s which belongs to innocence; "How bold tho&s;e women look!" cried Fouquier, enraged at their calmne&s;s; I mu&s;t go and &s;ee if they &s;hew the &s;ame effrontery on the &s;caffold, even if I &s;hould lo&s;e my dinner!"</P>
<P>Robe&s;pierre had now attained nearly the &s;ummit of his hopes; and his ignorance being equal to his vanity, he did not perceive that the few &s;teps he had to climb before he could gra&s;p at ab&s;olute domi|nion, mu&s;t be trodden with cautious prudence; &s;ince he had advanced &s;o far, that, if he was now compelled to de&s;cend, it could only be by a de&s;cent which would lead to death. He had de&s;troyed his mo&s;t powerful rival Danton; but his &s;pies and emi&s;&s;aries, and above all his guilty con&s;cience, told him that more of his colleagues mu&s;t fall to give him perfect &s;afety. He read in the countenances of the deputies, in the &s;ilent gloom with which his edicts were &s;anctioned, that new &s;torms gathered over his head; and he prepared in conjunction with Couthon, the means of putting the lives of all tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed him more ab&s;olutely in his power. In the mean time he thought fit to amu&s;e the people by a fe&s;tival in honour of the Supreme Being, who&s;e exi&s;tence he had lately proclaimed, and who&s;e name he had dared to utter with his unhallowed lips. The plan of the fe&s;tival was arranged by the celebrated painter David; he, who&s;e mind the cul|tivation of the finer arts has had no power to &s;of|ten; who, not &s;atisfied with di&s;playing on canva&s;s tho&s;e &s;cenes of &s;anguinary guilt which from the hor|rors they excite furni&s;h fit &s;ubjects for the pencil, has contributed to give them in his bleeding coun|try "a local habitation and a name;" who, in&s;tead of cheri&s;hing that &s;acred flame of enlightened liberty which is connected with the &s;ublimer powers of the imagination, was the lacquey of the tyrant

Robe&s;pierre, and the friend of the man of blood, Ma|rat; who, ambitious of recorded di&s;grace, of immor|tal ignominy, deba&s;ed the noble&s;t gift of heaven, ge|nius, and employed his degraded pencil in tracing the hideous features of the mon&s;ter Marat, while a groaning people were compelled to bow the knee be|fore the image he had &s;et up; and who, at the tri|bune of the national convention, in&s;ulted all common &s;en&s;e and decency by a compari&s;on which, from its audacious ab&s;urdity, excites as much ridicule as in|dignation. "Cato, Ari&s;tides, Socrates, Timoleon, Fabricius, and Phocion," exclaims the panegyri&s;t David, "ye who&s;e venerable lives I admire, I have not lived with you&mdash;but I have known Marat!" (ble&s;&s;ed compen&s;ation!) "I have admired him like you, and po&s;terity will do him ju&s;tice!" Yes, David, repo&s;e with your idol upon the civic crowns, the palms and laurels won by revolutionary mea&s;ures, and doubt not that po&s;terity will do am|ple ju&s;tice both to you and Marat. Po&s;terity will in|deed be &s;pared the ta&s;k of overthrowing his altars, &s;ince they are already in the du&s;t; and while the offences of many of our vulgar tyrants will be for|gotten with their ignoble names, David's &s;hame will be as durable as his celebrity.</P>
<P>While I am upon the &s;ubject of Marat and his friend, I cannot help ob&s;erving that nothing appears more &s;trange to us in this country than the opini|ons which are formed in England of the public characters of France, not by the enemies but by the friends of the French revolution. That Bri&s;|&s;ot, Gaudet, Vergniaud &s;hould receive no incen&s;e of applau&s;e from tho&s;e who perhaps lament that the king's ca&s;tle of the ba&s;tile was overthrown, is na|tural; but when we hear Mr. Sheridan &s;peak in the hou&s;e of commons of the <HI>faction of the Gironde,</HI> and when we read in Mr. Gilbert Wakefield's an|&s;wer

They might with as much propriety talk of the faction of Sidney, of Ru&s;&s;el, and of Hampden. Such ob&s;ervations are bla&s;phemies indeed from the lovers of liberty; they who ought to pronounce with veneration the names of tho&s;e illu&s;trious mar|tyrs, who, after the mo&s;t honourable &s;truggles for their country, &s;hed their blood upon the &s;caffold in its cau&s;e, with heroi&s;m worthy of the proude&s;t days of Greece or Rome.

Perhaps it will not be di&s;plea&s;ing to you to read the following &s;ketch of Bri&s;&s;ot, traced by Madame Roland, who was intimately acquainted with him, and who was &s;o admirable a judge of character.</P>
<P>"Bri&s;&s;ot came to vi&s;it us: I know nothing more plea&s;ant than the fir&s;t interview of tho&s;e who, though connected by corre&s;pondence, have never &s;een each other. We look with earne&s;tne&s;s to &s;ee if the features of the face bear any re&s;emblance to the phy&s;iognomy of the &s;oul, and if the figure of the per&s;on confirms the opinion which we have formed of the mind.</P>
<P>"The &s;implicity of Bri&s;&s;ot's manners, his frank|ne&s;s, his natural negligence, &s;eemed to me in per|fect harmony with the au&s;terity of his principles: but I found in him a &s;ort of lightne&s;s of mind and character which was not very con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of a philo&s;opher. This di&s;po&s;ition always gave me unea&s;ine&s;s, and his enemies always took advantage of it. The more I became ac|quainted with him, the greater was my e&s;teem. It is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to unite a more perfect di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s to a more ardent zeal for the pub|lic &s;ervice, or feel with &s;o perfect a forgetfulne&s;s of his own intere&s;t a greater de&s;ire of doing good. But his writings are more fitted than his per&s;on to effect it, becau&s;e they have all the authority which rea&s;on, ju&s;tice and knowledge give to literary works, while his figure, from its want of dignity, in&s;pires no re&s;pect. He is the be&s;t of human be|ings; a good hu&s;band, a tender father, a faithful friend, a virtuous citizen. His conver&s;ation is as mild as his character is ea&s;y. Confident even to imprudence, gay and &s;prightly as a youth of fifteen, he was formed to live with the wi&s;e, and to be the dupe of the wicked. As a well-informed politi|cian, and &s;tudying during his whole life the differ|ent
<PB N="173" REF="031634_0172_0FED62F29238FE48">
relations of &s;ociety, and the means of procur|ing the greate&s;t quantity of happine&s;s for the human race, he was well acquainted with the nature of man, and altogether ignorant of the characters of men. He knew that vice exi&s;ted, but he never could believe him to be a vicious man who &s;poke to him with an open countenance; and when he di&s;covered &s;uch per&s;ons he treated them as fools whom he ought to pity, without taking any precau|tions again&s;t them. He could not hate: his mind, though very &s;u&s;ceptible, had not &s;olidity enough for &s;o vigorous a &s;entiment. His knowledge was &s;o exten&s;ive, that all literary labour was to him ex|tremely ea&s;y: and he compo&s;ed a treati&s;e with the &s;ame facility as another would copy a &s;ong: an ex|perienced eye will therefore di&s;cern in his works, together with an excellent fund of information, the ha&s;ty touches of a rapid and &s;ometimes a &s;light mind. His activity, his good humour, never refu&s;ing to join in any thing which he thought u&s;eful, have given him the air of meddling in every thing; and have &s;ubjected him to animadver&s;ions as an intriguer by tho&s;e who were eager to find fault. A curi|ous kind of intriguer indeed! a man who never thought of him&s;elf, or even the intere&s;t of his friends; who is as incapable as he is aver&s;e to look after his own concerns; who is no more a&s;hamed of poverty than he is afraid of death, con&s;idering both as the u&s;ual reward of public virtues.</P>
<P>"I have &s;een him con&s;ecrating the whole of his time to the revolution, without any other motives than wi&s;hing to &s;ee the triumph of truth, and con|curring in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the public good; working diligently at his journal, which he might ea&s;ily have made a good object of &s;peculation, but contenting him&s;elf with the moderate &s;hare allowed him by his partner. His wife as mode&s;t as him&s;elf,

with much prudence and great &s;trength of mind, formed a more &s;evere judgment of things. She had, &s;ince their marriage, continually turned her eyes to|wards the United States of America, as the place mo&s;t &s;uited to their ta&s;te, and their manners, and where it was ea&s;y to live with a very &s;mall income.</P>
<P>"Bri&s;&s;ot had made a voyage thither, and they were on the point of their departure when the re|volution fixed him in France. As he was born at Chartres, and was the &s;chool-fellow of Pethion, who is a native of the &s;ame city, Bri&s;&s;ot formed a &s;till &s;tronger attachment to him in the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly, where his knowledge and his labour were of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to his friend. He brought us ac|quainted with him, as well as with many other de|puties whom former acquaintance or conformity of opinion and zeal for the public good frequently call|ed together to conver&s;e on the &s;ubject. It was even agreed that they &s;hould a&s;&s;emble four hours a week in the evening at my hou&s;e, becau&s;e I was always at home, had good apartments, and was &s;o conve|niently &s;ituated that it was not far from any of tho&s;e who compo&s;ed our little circle."</P>
<P>I cannot re&s;i&s;t adding to this &s;ketch the copy of a letter addre&s;&s;ed by Bri&s;&s;ot to Barrere, the day after the latter, from the tribune of the convention, had promi&s;ed to &s;atiate the people with Bri&s;&s;ot's blood.</P>

<P>From this profu&s;ion of gay objects, which in happier moments would have excited delightful &s;en|&s;ations, the drooping &s;oul now turned di&s;ta&s;teful. The &s;cent of carnage &s;eemed mingled with the&s;e lavi&s;h &s;weets; the glowing fe&s;toons appeared ting|ed with blood; and in the back ground of this fe&s;|tive &s;cenery the guillotine aro&s;e before the di&s;turbed imagination. I thought of that pa&s;&s;age in Mr. Burke's book, "In the groves of <HI>their</HI> academy, at the end of every vi&s;ta I &s;ee the gallows!" Ah Liberty! be&s;t friend of mankind, why have &s;an|guinary mon&s;ters profaned thy name, and fulfilled this gloomy prediction!&mdash;</P>
<P>A great amphitheatre was rai&s;ed in the garden of the Thuilleries immediately before the palace, now the &s;eat of the convention. Upon a tribune in the centre of the theatre, Robe&s;pierre as pre&s;ident of the convention appeared; and having for a few hours di&s;encumbered the &s;quare of the revolution of the guillotine this high-prie&s;t of Moloch, within view of that very &s;pot where his daily &s;acrifice of
<PB N="178" REF="031634_0177_0FED626CB8B6E3F0">
human victims was offered up, covered with their blood, invoked the Parent of univer&s;al nature, talk|ed of the charms of virtue, and breathed the hope of immortality. When the foul fiend had fini&s;hed this impious mockery, he de&s;cended from the tri|bune, and walked with great &s;olemnity towards a grote&s;que kind of monument that was rai&s;ed upon the ba&s;on in the front of the palace, which had been covered over for that purpo&s;e. On this monument was placed a mi&s;hapen and hideous figure, with a&s;s's ears, which for &s;ome hours &s;erved as an enigma to the gazing crowd, who knew not how to account for this &s;ingular appearance; till Robe&s;pierre having &s;et fire to this image of deformity, which was de|clared to be the &s;ymbol of athei&s;m, its cumbrous drapery &s;uddenly vani&s;hed, and a fair and maje&s;tic form was di&s;covered, emblematical of wi&s;dom and philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Athei&s;m being thus happily de&s;troyed, the con|vention, attended by a numerous proce&s;&s;ion of peo|ple, and preceded by triumphal cars and banners, marched to the Champ de Mars, where with much toil and co&s;t a rocky mountain had been reared, up|on who&s;e lofty &s;ummit the tyrant and his attendants climbed, and from whence he once more harangued the people; and the fe&s;tival clo&s;ed with hymns and choral &s;ongs in honour of the Supreme Being.</P>
<P>Robe&s;pierre on this day, intoxicated with his power, lo&s;t &s;ight of his u&s;ual prudence, and di&s;play|ed all the littlene&s;s of his vanity. He cau&s;ed a line of &s;eparation to be made between him&s;elf and the other deputies of the convention, and marched at &s;ome di&s;tance before them, like a captain at the head of his band. He had the folly to di&s;play his importance by keeping the convention and the a&s;|&s;embled multitude waiting, and the ceremony &s;u&s;|pended
<PB N="179" REF="031634_0178_0FED62B70209AEC8">
for two hours, while he was &s;ought for in vain. During the proce&s;&s;ion his creatures attempt|ed to rai&s;e the cry of "Vive Robe&s;pierre!" but it was faintly re-echoed by the &s;pectators, many of whom followed him with "cur&s;es, not loud but deep, which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not."</P>
<P>Two days after this fe&s;tival in honour of the Su|preme being, Robe&s;pierre, the &s;courge of his crea|tures, compelled the en&s;laved convention to pa&s;s a law, which permitted the revolutionary jury to condemn tho&s;e who were brought before them, from their own internal conviction, without any proof whatever, or hearing any witne&s;&s;es; and which al&s;o &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the &s;uperfluous office of offi|cial defender, or coun&s;el; a privilege that Cou|thon, who made the report in the name of the com|mittee of public &s;afety, a&s;&s;erted con&s;pirators by no means de&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Amid&s;t the definitions of ari&s;tocracy, when the law pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t &s;u&s;pected people, Couthon ingeniou&s;ly ob&s;erved, that any good citizen was authori&s;ed to arre&s;t every man in the &s;treet as an ari&s;tocrate, who held his head too much up or too much down, and al&s;o all tho&s;e who looked on one &s;ide, in&s;tead of looking you in the face.</NOTE>. In other words, the jury were now authori&s;ed to pa&s;s &s;entence without even the forms of a trial. From this period, till the fall of Robe&s;pierre, all the judicial &s;olemnities of the revo|lutionary tribunal con&s;i&s;ted in reading over the names of the accu&s;ed, who were immediately after declared by the jury to be guilty of a con&s;piracy again&s;t the &s;afety of the French people, and the in|divi&s;ibility of the French republic.</P>
<P>If any of the unhappy per&s;ons thus pro&s;cribed at|tempted to &s;peak in their defence, they were thus &s;ilenced by the pre&s;ident: "Tu n'a pas la parole<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"It is not your turn to &s;peak."</NOTE>" and if they per&s;i&s;ted in declaring their innocence,
<PB N="180" REF="031634_0179_0FED631644210990">
they were put what was called "hors de debats;" that is, ordered immediately out of the court, con|demned in their ab&s;ence, and &s;ent to execution. "I was not in pri&s;on when this con&s;piracy took place," cried the vi&s;counte&s;s de Noailles, madame de la Fayette's &s;i&s;ter. "But you would have been in the con&s;piracy if you <HI>had</HI> been there," an&s;wered the pre&s;ident; and this unfortunate lady, the mo|ther of three children, peri&s;hed with her own mo|ther and grandmother. Madame de la Fayette be|ing in another pri&s;on was, in the hurry of forming the li&s;ts of death, forgotten when her family &s;uffer|ed&mdash;and &s;till lives. From this period the pri&s;on&s;&punc; became the &s;cenes of unexampled horror and de|&s;pair. Till now, the crowds by which they were inhabited had &s;ubmitted to their fate with that cheer|ful re&s;ignation, and often with that carele&s;s gaiety which is buoyant at a Frenchman's heart in circum|&s;tances that would altogether overwhelm the &s;ink|ing &s;pirits of the people of other countries. The hou&s;es allotted for the pri&s;ons of the &s;u&s;pected per|&s;ons were for the mo&s;t part hotels of emigrants, which were placed in the mo&s;t agreeable &s;ituations of Paris, with exten&s;ive gardens, and commanding beautiful views of the country. Such habitations had nothing of that gloom and darkne&s;s which we u&s;ually a&s;&s;ociate with the idea of a pri&s;on, and they were peopled with the be&s;t &s;ociety of Paris.</P>
<P>The ladies were attentive to the duties of the toilette, the gentlemen were polite and a&s;&s;iduous, and the court-yard of the Luxembourg, the con|vent of St. Lazare, and &s;ome other pri&s;ons, exhi|bited of an evening almo&s;t as much brilliancy and gaiety as the Thuilleries or the Champs Eli&s;&eacute;es. Mu&s;ic and literature had their amateurs. At the Luxembourg, &s;elect circles were formed to hear lectures from men of letters, &s;ometimes on chemi&s;|try,
<PB N="181" REF="031634_0180_0FED627E903E6AB0">
&s;ometimes on a&s;tronomy. At St. Lazare, la|dies &s;ent invitations to dinner from the corridor of Frimaire to the corridor of Floreal, with the fame formalities as formerly from their re&s;pective ho|tels. Sometimes cards, &s;ometimes bout-rim&eacute;s, charades, and epigrams beguiled the evening of its length, and thus the days of captivity rolled on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The mai&s;ons d'arr&eacute;t were now &s;o multiplied that almo&s;t every &s;treet of Paris had its pri&s;on, and in &s;ome of the &s;maller hotels the revolutionary laws were le&s;s rigorou&s;ly ob&s;erved than in tho&s;e which contained a greater number of pri&s;oners. In&s;tead of giving a &s;ketch my&s;elf of one of the&s;e milder abodes of captivity, I &s;hall tran&s;late a letter written to me on that &s;ubject by M. Maron, the prote&s;tant mini&s;ter at Paris.</NOTE>. They were indeed embittered by one hour of mournful melancholy, and one of trembling terror: the fir&s;t when the evening paper arrived, and the li&s;t of the victims of the revolutionary tribunal was read over, among whom the pri&s;oners &s;eldom failed to find &s;ome friend or acquaintance to lament. But this was a &s;en&s;ation of gentle &s;adne&s;s, com|pared to that turbulent di&s;may excited by the hoar&s;e voice of the turnkey &s;ounding at midnight through the long galleries the knell of &s;ome devoted vic|tim, who was called upon to ri&s;e, in order to be led to the Conciergerie by gendarmes &s;ent for that purpo&s;e from the revolutionary tribunal. Still, however, amid&s;t the tears which the pri&s;oners &s;hed over their lo&s;t companions, many of them cheri&s;h|ed the fond hope that they them&s;elves &s;hould e&s;cape. But the law of the 22d of Prairial tore away every illu&s;ion of the imagination or the heart, and di&s;|played the general pro&s;cription of the pri&s;oners in all its extent of horror. It was no longer a &s;olitary individual who was called to death; multitudes were &s;ummoned at once. Every returning night, long covered carts drawn by four hor&s;es entered &s;ucce&s;&s;ively the court yards of the different pri&s;ons.
<PB N="182" REF="031634_0181_0FED6333B83E6830">
Whenever the trampling of the hor&s;es' feet was heard, the pri&s;oners prepared them&s;elves for their doom. The names of the victims marked for ex|ecution the following day were called over, and they were in&s;tantly hurried into the&s;e gloomy hear&s;es. The hu&s;band was &s;carcely allowed time to bid his wife a la&s;t farewell, or the mother to recommend her orphan children to the compa&s;&s;ion of &s;uch of the pri&s;oners as might &s;urvive the general calamity. At the pri&s;on of the Luxembourg, an hundred and &s;ixty-nine victims were in one night torn from their beds, and led to the grated dungeons of the Conciergerie, that pri&s;on over the gates of which might with equal propriety have been written, the &s;ame as over that of the infernal region of Dante,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Let him lo&s;e all hope who enters here."</NOTE> La&s;ciate &s;peranza voi ch'entrate;" for here it might literally be &s;aid, "hope never came, that comes to all." I have &s;een the Conciergerie, that abode of horror, that anti-chamber of the tomb. I have &s;een tho&s;e infectious cells, where the pri|&s;oners breathed contagion, where the walls are in &s;ome places &s;tained with the blood of the ma&s;&s;acres of September, and where a part of the &s;pacious court-yard, round which the grated dungeons are built, remains unpaved &s;ince that period, when the &s;tones were taken up for the purpo&s;e of burying the dead. I have &s;een the chamber, where the per&s;ons condemned by the revolutionary tribunal &s;ubmitted to the preparatory offices of the executioner; where his &s;ci&s;&s;ars cut off the lavi&s;h tre&s;&s;es of the youthful beauty, and where he tied her tender hands behind her wai&s;t with cords. Merciful Heaven! and among tho&s;e who have thus &s;uffered were per&s;ons to whom my heart was bound by the ties of friend&s;hip and affection.&mdash;But though I have &s;urvived &s;uch &s;cenes,
<PB N="183" REF="031634_0182_0FED62BB85691220">
they have left upon my heart that &s;ettled melancholy which never can be di&s;&s;ipated&mdash;For me, the world has lo&s;t its illu&s;ive colouring; its fairy &s;pells, its light enchantments have vani&s;hed; and death, the idea mo&s;t familiar to my imagination, appears to my wearied &s;pirit the only point of re&s;t.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual pretext for tho&s;e murders <HI>in ma&s;s,</HI> which were practi&s;ed at this period, was that of a con&s;piracy in the pri&s;ons; a vague and wide term which the tyrants might interpret at their plea&s;ure, and which gave them the power of including what|ever per&s;ons and whatever numbers they thought proper. Spies were placed in every pri&s;on, who, after making out their li&s;ts of pro&s;cription as they were directed by the tyrants, declared that a con|&s;piracy exi&s;ted, of which tho&s;e marked on the li&s;ts were the authors, or accomplices. Per&s;ons who had never &s;een or heard of each other till that mo|ment, were often brought together from different pri&s;ons to take their trial for the &s;ame con&s;piracy: and when the decemvirs wi&s;hed to get rid of any particular individual, he was without any he&s;itation added to what was called the <HI>fourn&eacute;e,</HI> the <HI>batch;</HI> for &s;uch was the appellation given to the crowds dragged together to the guillotine, and with &s;uch terms of jocular familiarity was mourning humanity in&s;ulted. Sometimes the per&s;ons accu&s;ed only re|ceived their act of accu&s;ation as they were led up to the tribunal. Sometimes in the hurry, confu&s;ion, and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s with which the&s;e indictments were made out, one per&s;on was mi&s;taken for another. The duche&s;s of Biron among other in&s;tances, went to the tribunal with an act of accu&s;ation which was de&s;tined for her &s;teward. The indifference of the tribunal with re&s;pect to &s;uch errors, enabled mon&s;. Loi&s;erolles, at &s;ixty years of age, to deceive his barbarous judges, by dying for his &s;on, a youth in
<PB N="184" REF="031634_0183_0FED634A5474D8D0">
his twenty-fir&s;t year. It was ob&s;erved, that this generous parent, who thus a &s;econd time gave life to his child, an&s;wered with uncommon alacrity when his name was called upon, and went with a look of exultation to the &s;caffold. Perhaps hi&s;tory does not offer a more affecting in&s;tance of parental tenderne&s;s, making the voluntary &s;acrifice of life to &s;ave the object of its affection. But this extraor|dinary epocha called forth the lights and &s;hades of the human character in all their &s;tronge&s;t colouring. The la&s;t exce&s;&s;es of ferocious crimes were con|tra&s;ted by the &s;ublime enthu&s;ia&s;m of the virtuous affections, &s;hedding their &s;weetne&s;s like &s;olitary flowers over the wilderne&s;s where &s;erpents hi&s;s, and bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t howl; and by the noble&s;t efforts of heroical philanthropy bidding us cea&s;e to de&s;pair of humanity, and converting the throb of indignant horror into the glow of &s;ympathetic ad|miration;&mdash;bidding us turn from the tribunal of blood, from Robe&s;pierre and his jury of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, to Loi&s;erolles dying for his child; to Madame Be|renger, led in the bloom of life to execution with her parents, and, altogether forgetful of her&s;elf, &s;eeking only to &s;upport the &s;inking &s;pirits of her mother;&mdash;to madame Bou&s;quet, the &s;i&s;ter-in-law of Gaudet, &s;corning the impious laws which puni&s;hed humanity with death, affording &s;helter to her pro|&s;cribed friends, and dying with them on the &s;caf|fold for having done &s;o.</P>
<P>Among the multitudes who peri&s;hed at this pe|riod, all were not armed with the &s;ame fortitude; and &s;ometimes even when tyranny &s;pared the life of its victim, its cruel per&s;ecutions bereaved the &s;uf|ferer of rea&s;on. Of this mademoi&s;elle&mdash;was a melancholy in&s;tance. This unfortunate young lady &s;aw her father, her mother, and &s;everal of her relations dragged to the &s;caffold: &s;he alone
<PB N="185" REF="031634_0184_0FED633B111C7670">
was &s;pared, and remained a pri&s;oner at the Con|ciergerie. Along the gloomy vaults of that terri|fic pri&s;on, by the dim light of &s;ickly lamps, &s;he fancied &s;he &s;aw the mangled &s;pectres of her murder|ed parents, and in a &s;hort time became entirely be|reft of rea&s;on. She ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed all &s;u&s;te|nance, and remained motionle&s;s as a &s;tatue, hold|ing to her bo&s;om her parrot, whom &s;he had in&s;i&s;ted on bringing with her to her dungeon. When con|jured by the other pri&s;oners to take &s;ome nouri&s;h|ment, &s;he only an&s;wered, "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I want nothing.&mdash;No, he wants nothing.&mdash;My parrot is like me, he wants nothing."</NOTE> Je n'ai be&s;oin de rien." "But your parrot," &s;aid they, "your poor parrot is hungry." "Non," &s;he con&s;tantly repli|ed, "non, il n'a be&s;oin de rien&mdash;Mon paroquet e&s;t comme moi&mdash;il n'a be&s;oin de rien." The tyrant has fallen, and the dungeon of this unfortunate young lady is thrown open&mdash;but alas! for her, re|dre&s;s and freedom have come too late&mdash;her rea&s;on is gone for ever!</P>
<P>The Poli&s;h prince&s;s Lubomir&s;ka united with &s;u|perior talents all the charms of early youth and di&s;tingui&s;hed beauty. She had been travelling through different countries of Europe, and two years &s;ince was compelled to leave Berne in Swit|zerland, on account of the attachment &s;he had avowed to the cau&s;e of the French revolution. She came with her hu&s;band to Paris, and cultivated the &s;ociety and friend&s;hip of Vergniaud and of other deputies of the convention, who were the mo&s;t eminent for their talents and their zeal for liberty. This democratic prince&s;s, to whom a true repub|lican would have offered a <HI>civic</HI> crown, became an object of re&s;entment to the vindictive Robe&s;pierre, on account of her friend&s;hip for &s;ome members of
<PB N="186" REF="031634_0185_0FED62ACD45A5B90">
the Gironde: &s;he was thrown into pri&s;on, from thence &s;ent to the revolutionary tribunal, and con|demned by the jury of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to die. Being in a &s;tate of pregnancy, her execution was deferred. In the mean time her friends gave information of her danger to Ko&s;ciu&s;ko, the Poli&s;h general, and de&s;ired his interpo&s;ition in her behalf. Ko&s;ciu&s;ko in&s;tantly di&s;patched a letter to Robe&s;pierre, declar|ing that the prince&s;s Lubomir&s;ka had ever &s;hewn the mo&s;t devoted attachment to the principles of liberty, and conjuring Robe&s;pierre to &s;pare the life of a zealous friend to the common cau&s;e in which France and Poland were engaged. Robe&s;pierre, after reading the letter, exclaimed, "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"What! pardon for a prince&s;s!&mdash;Ah, Ko&s;ciu&s;ko!&mdash;let her be guillotined."</NOTE> Quoi! grace pour une prince&s;&s;e!&mdash;Ah, Ko&s;ciu&s;ko!&mdash;qu'on la guillotine." The unhappy prince&s;s, having mi&s;|carried, was immediately &s;ent to execution.&mdash;Two days before the fall of Robe&s;pierre, eight women who had been re&s;pited having declared them&s;elves pregnant, were dragged to the &s;caffold. Among this number was the prince&s;s of Monaco. As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed along the court of the pri&s;on, &s;he &s;aid to the pri&s;on|ers who were a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee the &s;ad proce&s;&s;ion, and bid a la&s;t farewell to the companions of their mis|fortunes, "I go to death with the calmne&s;s which innocence in&s;pires, and wi&s;h you from my &s;oul a better fate." Then addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to one of the turnkeys who was leading her towards the chamber where the executioner waited to bind the victims, "I have one favour to a&s;k you," &s;aid &s;he, taking a pacquet from her bo&s;om, "will you promi&s;e to grant it? This pacquet contains my hair: I implore your compa&s;&s;ion, I conjure you in my own name, in the name of all who hear me, &s;end it to my &s;on, to
<PB N="187" REF="031634_0186_0FED6355B1509E58">
whom it is directed; &s;wear to me in the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e virtuous per&s;ons, whom the &s;ame de&s;tiny as mine awaits, that you will render me this la&s;t &s;er|vice which I require of humanity." The di&s;may and terror of one of her women who was involved in the pro&s;cription, formed a &s;triking contra&s;t to the firmne&s;s &s;he her&s;elf di&s;played. "Take courage, my dear friend," cried the prince&s;s, "take courage, it is the guilty only who ought to fear."&mdash;The pri|&s;on of Port Libre offered an affecting &s;pectacle of filial piety. Madame Lachabeau&s;&s;iere, in con&s;e|quence of a malignant denunciation made again&s;t her by her &s;on-in-law, was not only dragged to pri&s;on, but placed in a dungeon in clo&s;e confine|ment till the moment arrived when &s;he was to ap|pear before the tribunal. Her daughter, madame Male&s;&s;i, who was already confined in another pri|&s;on, procured leave to be transferred to that where her mother was immured, whom by tears and &s;up|plications &s;he obtained permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee. Madame Lachabeau&s;&s;iere was taken out of her dungeon, and led to her daughter, who flew towards her, and, throwing her arms round her neck, remained a long time pre&s;&s;ing her mother to her bo&s;om, and with|out power to articulate a word. After this melan|choly interview, madame Lachabeau&s;&s;iere was led back to her dungeon. Her &s;ituation affected her daughter &s;o deeply, that &s;he became bereft of her rea&s;on. Sometimes &s;he took up her needle-work for a few moments; then throwing it a&s;ide, ro&s;e with precipitation, and flew along the galleries of the pri&s;on, till &s;he reached her mother's cell. She u&s;ually &s;eated her&s;elf at the door, and li&s;tened at|tentively: when &s;he could hear nothing, &s;he u&s;ed to weep bitterly, and repeat again and again in a tone of de&s;pair, "Oh my mother! Oh, my ten|der, my unfortunate mother!" She often remained
<PB N="188" REF="031634_0187_0FED625BE7CA5720">
many hours together, &s;eated upon the &s;tone-floor, and &s;he was in a &s;tate of pregnancy. Her hair hung di&s;hevelled over her &s;houlders, her eye &s;eem|ed bent on vacancy, her cheeks were &s;ometimes flu&s;hed with deep red, and &s;ometimes of a deadly palene&s;s, and &s;he was often &s;eized with convul&s;ive faintings. Every day &s;he carried the greate&s;t por|tion of her food to her mother, who without this &s;uccour would have often wanted &s;ufficient nouri&s;h|ment for her &s;upport. It is &s;oothing to add, that ma|dame Lachabeau&s;&s;ier was &s;natched from death by the fall of the tyrant, and that her tender and vir|tuous daughter is re&s;tored to rea&s;on.</P>
<P>While the tyrants, far from finding any &s;atiety of blood in their daily murders, were erecting new ranges of &s;eats in the hall of the revolutionary tri|bunal, &s;ufficient to contain an hundred in&s;tead of fifty accu&s;ed per&s;ons, death now hovered in a new form over the pri&s;ons. The admini&s;trators of the police went to each pri&s;on attended by a &s;trong guard, and ordered the pri&s;oners to be &s;hut up in their re&s;pective chambers, and not &s;uffered to have any communication till the purpo&s;e of the vi&s;it was effected. They then went &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to every apartment, and demanded of the pri&s;oners their knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, razors, buckles, watches, and all the money they had in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The&s;e un|happy per&s;ons, being altogether ignorant of the ob|ject of the vi&s;it, had no time to conceal any thing, and were &s;tripped of all they had except fifty livres in paper, which each pri&s;oner was &s;uffered to re|tain in order to pay for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But from this day famine &s;cowled along the&s;e gloomy man|&s;ions, adding to the pangs of mental &s;ufferings tho&s;e of debility and di&s;ea&s;e. The pri&s;oners were no longer permitted to receive their daily meals from their own hou&s;es, or from a tavern; but were
<PB N="189" REF="031634_0188_0FED634D236124E8">
ordered from henceforth, in conformity to the laws of equality, to eat &agrave; la gamelle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Out of one di&s;h at a common table.</NOTE>. Their food was provided for them at the rate of fifty &s;ous a day, by a cook placed in the pri&s;on. Their nouri&s;hment con&s;i&s;ted of one meal in twenty-four hours, often too &s;canty to &s;atisfy the calls of hunger, and &s;ome|times compo&s;ed of &s;uch nau&s;eous diet as the greater part of the pri&s;oners were unable to eat.</P>
<P>Age and infirmity were denied every indulgence nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the di&s;ordered frame, or rai&s;e the &s;inking &s;pirits. A little bread &s;aved from this wretched meal, and water, was all that could be obtained during the re&s;t of the day<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Even the pri&s;oners of war ware compelled to &s;ubmit to this ri|gorous treatment. General O'Hara has &s;ince told me, that after having avoided the gamelle for &s;ome weeks on the plea of illne&s;s, he was at length forced to &s;hare the common evil. His friends in England will be glad to hear that he is now relea&s;ed from his lodg|ings in a pri&s;on, and from a gendarme when he walks out, and is gone on his parole to Chantilly.</NOTE>. To this meal the pri&s;oners at the Luxembourg, where nine hun|dred per&s;ons were confined, were &s;ummoned in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of three hundred at a time, by a great bell, which called them to a hall, at the door of which &s;tood the jailor, who had been an execution|er under Collot d'Herbois at Lyons<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The keeper of the pri&s;on at the time we were in confinement, Benoit, di&s;tingui&s;hed in Paris by the epithet of the bon Benoit, had long before this period been turned out of office, being unfit to ex|ecute the purpo&s;es of his ma&s;ters.</NOTE>. This man was remarkably tall, big, and mu&s;cular; his arms were bare to the elbow; he wore a fierce red cap, which had now become the &s;ymbol of blood, and looked as if he were prepared for a ma&s;&s;acre. He only &s;uffered twenty per&s;ons at a time to enter the hall, and then flinging the door in the faces of the others, obliged them to remain in the pa&s;&s;ages till

tho&s;e within were &s;eated at the table. The hour of dinner pa&s;&s;ed like the other hours of the day, in gloomy and unbroken &s;ilence; for even the &s;ooth|ing intercour&s;e of conver&s;ation was now forbidden, under the penalty of being dragged immediately be|fore the tribunal, &s;ince the &s;pies placed in the pri|&s;ons, whenever they ob&s;erved two or three per&s;ons talking together, inquired &s;ternly if they were form|ing a con&s;piracy. What mo&s;t occupied the minds of the pri&s;oners at this period was contriving the means of e&s;caping from their tyrants by a voluntary death, which was now become difficult, &s;ince they had been &s;tripped of every in&s;trument which could have &s;erved that purpo&s;e. Such was the &s;ituation of the&s;e unhappy victims of tyranny, when on the night of the 9th of Thermidor the toc&s;in &s;ounded, and the city was called to arms. Many circum|&s;tances which I &s;hall afterwards relate, led the pri|&s;oners to believe that the&s;e &s;ounds were the &s;ignal of a general ma&s;&s;acre. But the toc&s;in now rung the joyful, the triumphant peal of liberty. Before I give you a detail of the &s;cenes which pa&s;&s;ed on the 9th of Thermidor, I mu&s;t trace the political events which led to that memorable epocha, and re&s;cued France from a &s;tate which was the a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;hame of human nature; from a &s;tate more terri|ble than all which the mo&s;t cunning tyrant could have inflicted upon &s;laves whom he had previou&s;ly di&s;armed. And all this was &s;uffered by a nation which called it&s;elf free, which had taken up arms to a&s;&s;ert its freedom, and gained the mo&s;t glorious vic|tories in its defence. France, covered with all the laurels of heroic valour, and the terror of combined Europe, held out her neck to vulgar a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins and executioners, in&s;tead of crumbling them into du&s;t.&mdash;Such are the &s;trange contradictions of human na|ture!

The effects re&s;ulting from the terrible im|pul&s;e of revolutionary government upon the moral world, may perhaps be compared to tho&s;e produced upon the natural &s;cene by the tremendous tempe&s;ts which &s;ometimes &s;weep along the we&s;tern i&s;lands; when the mingled elements ru&s;h forth in irre&s;i&s;tible fury, when the deluging waters bear away vegeta|tion, trees, and rocks, and the &s;hrieking whirlwinds &s;hake the dwellings of man to their foundations.&mdash;The &s;torm is pa&s;t&mdash;the enormous vapours have rolled away&mdash;a &s;oft light hovers on the horizon, and we are now left at lei&s;ure to &s;igh over the ruins that &s;urround us, and lament the victims laid pro&s;|trate by the bla&s;t.

I cannot however promi&s;e you any very intere&s;ting detail: the hotel Talaru, converted into a mai&s;on d'arr&ecirc;t of the &s;ection Lepelletier, has been the &s;cene of no very remarkable events. It never was reck|oned in the number of tho&s;e fatal dep&ocirc;ts which were called the antichambers of the guillotine. But it is probable that it would have had its turn al&s;o. There
<PB N="193" REF="031634_0192_0FED62A32DD04D50">
is even room to believe that it would not have been long delayed, if the ninth of Thermidor had not, for our good fortune, deranged certain <HI>anthropopha|gical</HI> mea&s;ures announced by Barrere in the &s;itting of the convention previous to that day. But I am anticipating facts; and as I have to write a journal, and not an epic poem, I &s;hall keep within chronolo|gical order.</P>
<P>Though my re&s;idence in Paris does not exceed twelve years, I have witne&s;&s;ed the building of the hotel Talaru, in the rue Richelieu, now rue de la Loi, near the national library, by the marquis of that name; who was fir&s;t maitre-d'h&ocirc;tel to the queen. Con&s;iderably reduced in his fortune by the new order of things, the citizen Talaru took la&s;t year the re&s;olution of leaving his hotel, and of with|drawing into the adjoining hou&s;e, which al&s;o be|longed to him, and which was called the little hotel Talaru. He let the great hotel to one Genc&eacute;, a tavern-keeper, who intended to make it a furni&s;hed hotel. Genc&eacute;, on reflection, thought that it was not probable that any con&s;iderable number of fo|reigners would come to Paris under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, or that the citizens of the depart|ments would now find Paris a very plea&s;ant abode; and fearful that he had made a bad &s;peculation, he was anxious to rid him&s;elf of the affair. We had now reached that di&s;a&s;trous period when mai&s;ons d'arr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;prang up in every quarter; when every &s;ection in Paris had its exclu&s;ive pri&s;ons at the &s;er|vice of its revolutionary committee; and Genc&eacute; propo&s;ed the hotel Talaru to the revolutionary committee of the &s;ection Lepelletier, to be ap|plied to this patriotic purpo&s;e. His propo&s;al was accepted, and the agreement made; but I have ne|ver learnt what were the conditions. A German
<PB N="194" REF="031634_0193_0FED6307F95932B8">
porter was put into this new pri&s;on, and the mine became worth the digging.</P>
<P>In reality, all whom their evil de&s;tiny led hither were made to pay for their lodging a mo&s;t exorbi|tant price. Such was in a &s;hort time the fate of Talaru him&s;elf. He expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h, on account of his age and infirmities, to have a room to him&s;elf; and he obtained this &s;pecial favour at the rate of 18 livres a day, that is, paying almo&s;t as much for his &s;mall apartment as he him&s;elf was paid for the whole hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I was the eighth per&s;on who was lodged in a beau|tiful &s;aloon on the ground floor towards the garden. We each paid four livres a day. This &s;aloon therefore brought in three hundred livres a decade, nine hundred and &s;ixty livres a month, ten thou|&s;and two hundred and fifty livres a year; and the whole hotel was let by the proprietor for &s;even thou&s;and livres. What became of this exorbitant rent, and among whom were the &s;poils divided, as I have never been in the &s;ecret, I can give no in|formation on that head.</P>
<P>On the 10th of Thermidor we were about two hundred pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>If any per&s;on complained of the&s;e extortions, he was an&s;wered, "Citizen, you are at liberty to leave this place, and if you like you may be transferred el&s;ewhere." But the fear of being thrown into &s;ome one of tho&s;e hou&s;es which were premature graves, made us bear with re&s;ignation the ills we had.</P>
<P>It was on the 19th of Prairial that I exchanged my own mode&s;t apartment for the fine &s;aloon in que&s;tion. The order of the committee of public &s;afety by which I was arre&s;ted, did not expre&s;s in what pri&s;on I &s;hould be confined. I a&s;ked therefore the agent of the committee, who was the bearer of
<PB N="195" REF="031634_0194_0FED634ED3CFD2B8">
the warrant, conjointly with two members of the revolutionary committee of my own &s;ection, if I might be allowed to choo&s;e my pri&s;on? He an&s;wer|ed courteou&s;ly, that he did not wi&s;h for any thing more than to oblige me.</P>

<P>Happily things did not proceed to this extremity. I referred my&s;elf to the knowledge and kind offices of my courteous agent, and he carried me to the ho|tel Talaru. I found on my entrance an order of things altogether different from what I had expected. I thought that all the mai&s;ons d'arr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t were at this period equally guarded, and treated with the &s;ame rigour, and prepared my&s;elf for &s;olitary confinement and the <HI>gamelle.</HI> But I found the communication among the pri&s;oners perfectly free: they vi&s;ited each other without any impediment, and even the communication without was attended with very lit|tle difficulty. I &s;aw &s;ome receive their wives and children, others their friends and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. Per|&s;ons of both &s;exes met together; every one amu&s;ed him&s;elf as he thought proper, and fared as he liked. If it was not the image of <HI>liberty,</HI> it was at lea&s;t that of <HI>equality</HI> and <HI>fraternity;</HI> and I &s;aid to my&s;elf, "Well! if we mu&s;t build our tabernacles here, &s;o let it be!" How many per&s;ons whom I knew were much more to be pitied than my&s;elf! The art of contentment is to look not at what is better, but what is wor&s;e than our own &s;ituation.</P>

Here then, for the third time &s;ince the in&s;titution of the republic, was I deprived de la cl&eacute;f des champs; "of the key of the fields."&mdash;I have perhaps more merit than many others in loving the republic, which has co&s;t me more per&s;onal vexations than I had ever dreamt of &s;uffering.</P>
<P>The very day of its proclamation (21&s;t Septem|ber 1792, O. S.) I was arre&s;ted at Seves, for twenty-four hours, from having met the munici|pality and the military force of the place, at the hou&s;e of one of my friends whom they were come to take to pri&s;on, and who was then gone to Paris to confound the calumny of his per&s;ecutors before the committee of general &s;afety. The fir&s;t anniver&s;ary of this &s;ame day, twenty fu&s;ileers took me from my bed at five in the morning, and I was lodged in the horrible chambre d'arr&ecirc;t of the mayoralty-hou&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We were &s;towed up in that place to the number of one hundred and two.

<PB N="198" REF="031634_0197_0FED63100DA4A918">
honour of the Supreme Being. My ab&s;ence from this national &s;olemnity gave me pain. Notwith|&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid of the decree of the convention expre&s;&s;ing the adhe&s;ion of the French nation to the immutable principles of all morality and all wor&s;hip, I cannot help ob&s;erving that this decree is one of tho&s;e propo&s;ed by Robe&s;pierre which I di&s;approved the lea&s;t. Atrocious di&s;tur|bers of &s;ocial order, by carrying to their utmo&s;t length the mo&s;t impious abominations, had thrown on republican France a general odium. Ju&s;tice had overtaken the&s;e per&s;ons; but the coale&s;ced pow|ers were not le&s;s careful to take advantage of this delirium, and di&s;credit the cau&s;e of liberty with their own people, by treating as <HI>athei&s;ts,</HI> that is to &s;ay, as univer&s;al <HI>di&s;organizers,</HI> its parti&s;ans and friends. The national repre&s;entation was willing to give an authentic and formal denial to this ca|lumny; and it is true that in this point of view the decree had a good effect. The convention never entertained the ab&s;urd idea of decreeing that God exi&s;ted, that the &s;oul was immortal, and that the French ought to believe this becau&s;e &s;uch was the good plea&s;ure of the legi&s;lature. It meant, by a declaration of a kind as new as the circum|&s;tances were in which it was placed, to ab&s;olve and exculpate a great nation from tho&s;e calumnious imputations &s;eized on by its enemies to &s;erve their views; and I repeat it, all the friends of principle have applauded the decree, and I confe&s;s that I was enthu&s;ia&s;tic in its favour.</P>
<P>It was for its object, and not the mode of cele|brating the fe&s;tival of the 20th of Prairial, that I regretted my ab&s;ence from it. The mode I had judged beforehand would be a &s;eries of pantomimes and <HI>harlequinades;</HI> and during a long walk I had taken in the country a few days before, I had la|mented

Soon after, the entrance of the news-pa|pers was forbidden, and this prohibition was not one of tho&s;e things which affected us the lea&s;t. It was common enough, however, to have a news|paper &s;muggled in, and then it was privately hand|ed about, and &s;ought after with anxious curio&s;ity, for we never failed learning the death of &s;ome ac|quaintance or friend; but we were informed al&s;o of the &s;ucce&s;s of our armies; and their victories

<P>A &s;hort time had elap&s;ed, when in the chamber where I lodged we had a precious re&s;ource for in|telligence. The fir&s;t &s;ecretary of the liquidation office, the citizen Dutilleul, was one of our fel|low-pri&s;oners. He was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in his office, that the director-general Denormandie was autho|ri&s;ed <HI>to put him in requi&s;ition</HI> every time he &s;tood in need of him, and this happened almo&s;t every day. At &s;even o'clock, Dutilleul was &s;ent for at the mai&s;on d'arr&egrave;t, and conducted by a gendarme to his office, where he pa&s;&s;ed the whole day at work; and the grateful republic put him under lock and key every evening. Judge how well he was que&s;|tioned on his entrance; and it happened pretty of|ten, that <HI>through inadvertence</HI> he had left the "jour|nal of debates and decrees" at the bottom of his pocket. In the meanwhile we killed the pre&s;ent time, and &s;hut our eyes on the future, by play and bodily exerci&s;e; &s;uch as battledore and &s;huttlecock, and fives: we fea&s;ted, read, and made <HI>bout-rim&eacute;s.</HI> I frequently partook of the two la&s;t amu&s;ements with a very amiable young man named R&mdash;n, and we had a Mu&s;e, who daily amu&s;ed her&s;elf in &s;etting up &s;ome prize, which my antagoni&s;t, I own, generally obtained.

<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed away the long days of Prairial and Me&s;&s;idor; Thermidor came. Till this time we had been &s;oothed with the con&s;oling idea, that the hotel Talaru was only a dep&ocirc;t of pri&s;oners detained

as a mea&s;ure of general &s;afety, and not of tho&s;e who were termed &s;u&s;pected; and that there was little apprehen&s;ion of any thing more than captivity. The fourth of this month robbed us of this a&s;&s;u|rance. Three of our companions were taken from us the preceding evening; Talaru, the proprietor of the hou&s;e; Boutin, former trea&s;urer of the navy, known by his beautiful Engli&s;h garden, which he called Tivoli<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The <HI>French Virgil</HI> has con&s;ecrated the&s;e ver&s;es to him:

<P>P. S. A &s;ingular anecdote I cannot help relating. Rou&s;&s;elin, one of my fellow-pri&s;oners at the ho|tel Talaru, had been carried before the revolutio|nary tribunal, and acquitted. He came the next day to vi&s;it his old companions, and impart to us the good news. He informed me on this occa&s;ion, that a Dutchman called Van Hooff had been dragged to the guillotine at the moment when he (Rou&s;&s;elin) entered the Conciergerie, and that he lay down on the bed yet warm of this unfortunate man, who had ju&s;t left it.

&s;o much the more &s;trongly per&s;uaded of the death of Van Hooff, as it was announced in &s;everal of the public papers: and you may imagine without much difficulty what was my a&s;toni&s;hment, when a fort|night or three weeks after, I received a letter from Van Hooff, in which he congratulated me on the ju&s;tice which had been done me, and begged me to u&s;e my intere&s;t to procure him his liberty.

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;urrender of Lyons, which took place &s;ome-days previous to the murder of the deputies of the Gironde, contributed to ha&s;ten the execution of that atrocious deed. The Lyonnais had long &s;truggled again&s;t the commi&s;&s;aries of the mountain faction, who, under the pretence of an ardent zeal for liber|ty, were diligent in &s;eeking opportunities for riot and plunder; and however &s;trongly this detachment of con&s;pirators were &s;upported by tho&s;e who direct|ed their motions from Paris, they could not with|&s;tand the indignation and vengeance of the citizens of Lyons, who, rou&s;ed by the dangers with which
<PB N="209" REF="031634_0208_0FED63F74663F898">
they were threatened, cru&s;hed their oppre&s;&s;ers, the chief of whom, Chalier, they &s;ent to the &s;caffold. The Lyonnais had proceeded too far to hope for any mercy from the faction, who had now accompli&s;h|ed their trea&s;on at Paris: and &s;eeing the cau&s;e of li|berty abandoned by the departments, who had made their peace with the traitors, they were driven ei|ther to &s;uffer patiently the weight of their wrath, or prepare to oppo&s;e it. Of this dreadful alterna|tive they cho&s;e the latter; but finding them&s;elves un&s;upported in the project they had at fir&s;t formed of marching to Paris, they determined to defend their own city. In the mean time they employed the mo&s;t honourable means to explain to the conven|tion, that their re&s;i&s;tance aro&s;e neither from di&s;af|fection to the republic, nor from any wi&s;h to form a federal government, of which they had been ac|cu&s;ed; that they had &s;worn fidelity to the republi|can con&s;titution, and had i&s;&s;ued orders to a&s;&s;emble the primary a&s;&s;emblies for its acceptance. But re|&s;i&s;tance for any cau&s;e was now a crime, and this conce&s;&s;ion of the Lyonnais only &s;erved to increa&s;e the in&s;olence of their oppre&s;&s;ors, who decreed that the city was in a &s;tate of rebellion, and that all who had re&s;orted thither from the neighbouring depart|ments &s;hould be treated as emigrants: for the con|&s;pirators ea&s;ily perceived that this city might form a central point of oppo&s;ition, by collecting together all tho&s;e per&s;ons in the &s;outhern provinces who were aver&s;e to the revolutionary order of things. An army was immediately levied, and ordered to march again&s;t Lyons; and it was believed that when the Lyonnais were informed that the affair was about to became &s;o &s;erious, they would make no farther oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The general who commanded the conventional army, endeavoured by proclamations to conciliate
<PB N="210" REF="031634_0209_0FED63B34A53C898">
the parties, but in vain. His propo&s;als of pardon were rejected by tho&s;e who thought them&s;elves in|jured, and who know by fatal experience what de|gree of confidence was to be placed in the offer of tender mercies from the cruel. The Lyonnais were allowed three hours to deliberate on the gracious propo&s;itions of the general, but a di&s;charge of can|non returned their an&s;wer before the fir&s;t had ex|pired; and though new proclamations were i&s;&s;ued, and on the anniver&s;ary of the 10th of Augu&s;t both parties &s;ent deputations to celebrate that event to|gether, the Lyonnais continued their warlike oppo|&s;ition, and prepared to make an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the mean time the department of Mont-Blanc, formerly Savoy, was recovered by the Piedmonte&s;e, who took advantage of the ab&s;ence of the army which had been called off for the purpo&s;e of reducing Lyons; and the repre&s;entatives who conducted the operations of the &s;iege wrote to the convention to repeal the decree which the con&s;pirators in their wrath had poured out again&s;t that city. The Ly|onnais were as deaf to the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions as they had been to the proclamations of the generals, who now proceeded to extremities, and began the bombard|ment of the city, which was &s;et on fire in &s;everal places, and a great number of the inhabitants pe|ri&s;hed. Other proclamations followed this act of ho&s;tility, which met with the &s;ame reception. The black flag continued floating on the towers, indi|cating re&s;i&s;tance till death; and though the city, being unfortified, had nothing to defend it but the bravery of its inhabitants, no impre&s;&s;ion could be made except by bombardment. The con&s;pirators therefore &s;ent their emi&s;&s;aries into the adjoining de|partments to rai&s;e the people <HI>in ma&s;s;</HI> and, if any credit is to be given to the reports of tho&s;e who were employed, the be&s;ieging army was reinforced
<PB N="211" REF="031634_0210_0FED63BBC871BA58">
by other armies amounting to fifty thou&s;and men With this reinforcement the attack began afre&s;h the city was &s;urrounded, all communication cut off, and the convention was informed that famine would &s;oon effect what the ob&s;tinacy of the Lyonnais had hitherto prevented. During three months the&s;e brave republicans contended again&s;t the numerous armies that the con&s;pirators had a&s;&s;embled; and had not their ardor been checked by their commanders, they would all have witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t the cowardice and ba&s;ene&s;s of their countrymen, by whom they were left un&s;upported, with the la&s;t drop of their blood. After having performed prodigies of valour, till they were overpowered by numbers, and re&s;i&s;t|ance became no longer po&s;&s;ible, they endeavoured to effect their retreat, by forcing their way through the be&s;iegers; for according to the di&s;patches &s;ent to the convention they were entirely &s;urrounded. In this retreat &s;ome &s;ucceeded; but a great part were cut to pieces, and the conventional army entered the city in triumph.</P>
<P>With the &s;avage joy of the fami&s;hed cannibal, when he &s;eizes on &s;ome &s;hip-wrecked wretch whom the waves have unkindly &s;pared from the fate of his companions, the mountain con&s;pirators heard of the reduction of Lyons. The committee of public &s;afety, through the organ of Barrere, in congratu|lating the convention on the news, informed them that mea&s;ures were taken to exterminate every fugi|tive; that no weakne&s;s, no mercy &s;hould be &s;hewn; and that this den of con&s;pirators mu&s;t make ample reparation, and that this reparation mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in burying this rebel city under its own ruins.

During this wa&s;te of life, that of the property of the unfortunate victims was not more re&s;pected. "It co&s;ts four hundred thou&s;and livres each decade for <HI>demolitions,</HI>" writes one of the&s;e demons, who talks of re-colonizing the country. "More heads every day, more heads are falling.

<P>Where then, it might be a&s;ked, was the conven|tion, while the&s;e horrors were executing? Where? Alas! this convention, &s;ent by a free people to con|&s;olidate their liberty, was in chains. Had it been le&s;s en&s;laved, the decree, that Lyons &s;hould no longer exi&s;t, would have ju&s;tified the executioners.&mdash;Collot was not willing that this decree of deva&s;|tation &s;hould remain a figure of rhetoric&mdash;he &s;ays &s;o: "The revolutionary army arrives the day after to-morrow, and then," continues he, "I &s;hall be able to perform great things.

<P>It will &s;carcely be thought po&s;&s;ible, yet it is very generally believed, that Collot was led to this ven|geance on the people of Lyons for having hi&s;&s;ed him when he acted on their &s;tage. Thou&s;ands of victims have atoned for the in&s;ult offered to a wretched comedian; and this great city, which from the time of Augu&s;tus had been the centre of the commerce of Gaul, where he lavi&s;hed his favours,

and for three ages received the tribute of gratitude in the honours that were rendered him, had now fallen under the &s;troke of the mo&s;t vulgar of ty|rants. Had the&s;e mon&s;ters looked for precedents for their cruelties, they might have found them in their prototype Caligula, for in this very city that tyrant once re&s;ided: and the re&s;emblance of Cali|gula and Collot is &s;o far &s;triking, that they both exerci&s;ed their de&s;poti&s;m over the &s;ame cla&s;s of ci|tizens; though the motives of Caligula appear to have been more natural than tho&s;e of Collot, and his cruelty more di&s;criminate.</P>
<P>While this tragic ruffian was acting his part at Lyons, others with principles as atrocious, though they were le&s;s &s;teeped in blood, were carrying de|&s;olation into other parts of France. Bourdeaux, which had been rai&s;ing it&s;elf to the height of the revolution, was now a prey to the caprice of a young mon&s;ter who had not yet counted twenty years, and who was the valet of Robe&s;pierre in the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes.

His corre&s;pondence is as &s;illy as it is atrocious, and of its atrocity we may judge when he condemns the mea&s;ures of blood already taken as being moderate and almo&s;t counter-revolutionary. It appears that he was one of the fir&s;t who had denounced the enormities of Carrier; but ages of puni&s;hment or repentance will not atone for the murder of Salles and Gaudet, who were executed at Bourdeaux dur|ing Julien's admini&s;tration, together with Gaudet's father, mother, &s;i&s;ter and her hu&s;band, the hu&s;|band's brother, and one of his aunts; in &s;hort, the whole family, excepting Gaudet's wife, who&s;e

<P>NO cla&s;s of men were more intere&s;ted in the pre&s;ervation of the abu&s;es of the ancient govern|ment than the prie&s;ts. When the con&s;tituent a&s;|&s;embly le&s;&s;ened the influence of the higher clergy, by &s;tripping the church of its domains, and making the &s;alaries of its mini&s;ters more equal, the na|tional wealth was not only increa&s;ed, but the great ma&s;s of the prie&s;thood were &s;atisfied with the di&s;tribution. The majority of tho&s;e who had hi|therto directed the machine of the revolution were fully per&s;uaded that the prie&s;thood &s;hared but little in its &s;pirit; and, knowing that whatever does not keep pace with his career, retards its progre&s;s, had &s;ought at different times to di&s;&s;olve the alliance of the church and &s;tate altogether. They felt indeed that the article in the declaration of rights, which &s;ays, "that no one &s;hall be di&s;turbed in his religious opinions," mu&s;t be eventually &s;ubver&s;ive of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion; &s;ince whoever believed it to be not only unnece&s;&s;ary and expen&s;ive, but ho&s;tile to the great principles of liberty, would murmur at contributing to its &s;upport.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable part of the clergy refu&s;ed to ac|cede to the civil con&s;titution which the con&s;titu|ent a&s;&s;embly had formed, alleging that in matters of religion, or in the regulations of the church, no one ought to guide their faith, or receive their obe|dience, but the per&s;onage who, in con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion

from the great author of chri&s;tianity, had held the delegated power. This cla&s;s had by their non|conformity lo&s;t their employment, but they were not the le&s;s cheri&s;hed on that account by tho&s;e who thought with them&s;elves, that man was made for the &s;abbath, and not the &s;abbath for man. The zeal of the&s;e non-jurors for the faith which they contended was once delivered to the &s;aints, was too ardent to &s;uffer this humiliation of the church in &s;ilence; nor was the vigilance of the friends of the revolution le&s;s awake to counteract their ef|forts. The maje&s;ty of the church, of which they believed them&s;elves to be the only true &s;upporters, would not permit them to bow before the maje&s;ty of the people; and when the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly undertook to be the interpreters of the law, and enacted decrees for the bani&s;hment of the uncon|&s;titutional clergy, they &s;ought refuge in the maje&s;ty of the throne, the cheri&s;hed ally hitherto of the church, who&s;e power was at this time &s;carcely more confirmed than its own.</P>

they perhaps an&s;wered as Gui&s;e did to Pol|trot, "If your religion enjoins you to murder, ours compels us to forgive."</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of the national convention was &s;till more unfavourable than that of the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly to the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment of the clergy. The truth is, that the enlightened part of the coun|try had con&s;idered religion as a per&s;onal thing. Tho&s;e who believed, of which the number was not very great, thought the protection of the &s;tate no addition to its dignity; and tho&s;e who di&s;believed, or, which was the &s;ame, confounded the doctrines of chri&s;tianity and the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, thought that its alliance was not only burden&s;ome, but per|nicious. The great divi&s;ions of the contending parties for the government gave the prie&s;thood re&s;|pite. But no &s;ooner was this que&s;tion decided, and the reign of Robe&s;pierre e&s;tabli&s;hed, than the men of rea&s;on, as they called them&s;elves, renewed the attack again&s;t the men of the church, who were unable to make any farther re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The con&s;titutional clergy had no protection but that which was given them by the con&s;titution now pro&s;cribed, and had in&s;pired no intere&s;t in the de|votees, who con&s;idered them rather as apo&s;tates from religion, than defenders of the faith; and treacherous guides in the road of &s;alvation, on ac|count of their compliance with the law.</P>
<P>A &s;trict adherence to the ceremonies and doc|trines of the Romi&s;h church was not the only &s;u|per&s;tition that darkened France. There was ano|ther of a more terrible nature and more de&s;tructive of &s;ocial order, which was athei&s;m. Voltaire has ob&s;erved, that a rea&s;oning athei&s;t is a greater &s;courge to mankind, than the mo&s;t &s;anguinary fanatic. The commune of Paris had a&s;&s;umed this character; and, having twice contributed to overturn the civil go|vernment

of the country in the &s;pace of a few months, imagined that the kingdom of the next world was to be taken by force as well as the king|dom of the pre&s;ent. This formidable project was conceived, and brought to maturity in mode&s;t &s;i|lence. The good people of Paris, who had trou|bled them&s;elves but little about religion, but who imagined that there might be &s;omething good in it, as there is in the wor&s;t of vocations, were extreme|ly &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the archbi&s;hop of Paris, with his clergy, pre&s;ent them&s;elves at the bar of the con|vention, attended by the con&s;tituted powers of the department and the municipality, "to be regene|rated;" that is, to abjure their former belief, and make their new confe&s;&s;ion of faith, in which they declared that there was no other duty than liberty, no other go&s;pel than the republican con&s;titution, and no other wor&s;hip than equality. This illumi|nation was not the re&s;ult of the deep &s;tudies either of the archbi&s;hop or his vicars. The &s;ecret was imparted to him by Chamette, the procurer of the commune, to whom it was di&s;covered by one Clootz commonly called Anachar&s;is, a Pru&s;&s;ian by birth, and an athei&s;t by profe&s;&s;ion, who&s;e hi&s;tory I have already related. Clootz had written a book, which he told the convention on pre&s;enting it was the fruit of fifteen hours labour every day during the cour&s;e of four years. He al&s;o in&s;tructed them, that this work, &s;ingular in its method and curious in its de|tail, overturned at one &s;troke all &s;ects, antient or modern, of natural or revealed religion.&mdash;Of this work, which "proved the nothingne&s;s of all reli|gion," the convention decreed the acceptance, and honourable mention; and, thus armed, Anachar&s;is &s;et out on his travels to convert the world to athe|i&s;m. There was &s;omething ma&s;terly in his fir&s;t

attempt; and had he been &s;atisfied with the con|ver&s;ion of the archbi&s;hop and the commune, whom he brought to the bar of the convention, he might have enjoyed his triumph in &s;ecurity; but when he attempted to pro&s;elyte the convention it&s;elf, Robe|&s;pierre oppo&s;ed the invader with his doctrine of the Supreme Being, and Anachar&s;is was &s;ent to the pri&s;on of the Luxembourg. There a friend of mine found him in daily controver&s;y with Thomas Paine, who had ju&s;t written "The Age of Rea|&s;on," for his credulity in &s;till indulging &s;o many religious and political prejudices. Soon after, this vain enthu&s;ia&s;t was &s;ent by his polemic antagoni&s;t Robe&s;pierre to the guillotine, where many of his converts in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion followed him, and among his pupils was the archbi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Many of the bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts who were de|puties in the a&s;&s;embly, and &s;ome of the mini&s;ters of the prote&s;tant faith, animated by the example of the archbi&s;hop, made their public recantation. Of this la&s;t &s;ect one ob&s;erved that, though his &s;y&s;|tem of faith inculcated, more than any other, mo|ral obligations, yet, as the great day of judgment was arrived, the reign of rea&s;on, the triumph of philo&s;ophy, he mu&s;t dive&s;t him&s;elf of his &s;acerdotal character, and become regenerated al&s;o, &s;ince, as he confe&s;&s;ed, "tous les pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tres dans tous les cultes ont toujours un peu de charlatani&s;me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All prie&s;ts of all religions have a little &s;pice of the mounte|bank.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The ingenuou&s;ne&s;s in the members of one pro|fe&s;&s;ion provoked the &s;ame candour in tho&s;e of ano|ther. The prie&s;ts having confe&s;&s;ed that there was a little quakery in their admini&s;tration of the next world, the phy&s;icians crowded to the bar of the commune, to acknowledge that they had been "un

peu pr&ecirc;tres" al&s;o, and that a little &s;pice of moun|tebank dealing entered into their admini&s;tration of this. Admitting that nature and rea&s;on were the be&s;t remedies, they made offerings of their diplo|mas by which they had been authori&s;ed to cure <HI>&s;e|cundum artem,</HI> in direct contradiction to both; and this virtuous dereliction of their former practice was rewarded with applau&s;es and civic in&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Reformation, as well as terror, was the order of the day: the &s;earching eye of the commune left nothing unexplored. To the epuration of the prie&s;ts and phy&s;icians, &s;ucceeeded that of the co|medians, who had no profe&s;&s;ional &s;ins to confe&s;s, &s;ince they had acted their parts on the &s;tage of the world without any di&s;gui&s;e. However, the com|mune thought that tho&s;e who had been in the ha|bitude of per&s;onating princes, and nobles, and queens, and counte&s;&s;es, could little reli&s;h habits of equality, and therefore &s;ent to pri&s;on both actors and actre&s;&s;es as &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of reform did not &s;top at the con&s;e|cration of the &s;poils of the church to the &s;ervices of the &s;tate. It &s;eized on tho&s;e privileges which in all countries, and under every e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion, have been accorded with the common con&s;ent of mankind, and on the exerci&s;e of which much of the order and happine&s;s of the world has been thought to depend. On our entrance into the world it is the prie&s;t who confers on us our moral exi&s;tence; in riper days it is he who hallows our affections; and without his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion we have been taught to think that our road to heaven was not altogether &s;ecure. Of the two fir&s;t of the&s;e func|tions, the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;the fathers brought their children to be regenerated at the municipal font, and the lover led his blu&s;hing mi&s;tre&s;s before the altar of Hymen, and received

The care of di&s;po&s;ing of the citizens at death yet remained to the church, and the funerals continued to darken the way in long proce&s;&s;ions, till the com|mune &s;eized on this la&s;t prerogative of the clergy, and decreed, that gay revolutionary colours of the nation &s;hould take place of the funeral pall&mdash;the prie&s;ts &s;hould be changed into municipal officers, and the cemetery &s;hould be called the place of re|po&s;e, where, in&s;tead of the hope of being troubled with a re&s;urrection, the citizens &s;hould have the privilege of &s;leeping for ever.</P>
<P>The church of Notre Dame was changed into the temple of Rea&s;on; and the commune, with the divinity her&s;elf, attended by a &s;plended train, came to reque&s;t the convention to &s;anctify with their pre&s;ence the con&s;ecration. The Godde&s;s of Rea|&s;on was a fine blooming dam&s;el of the opera-hou&s;e, and acted her part in this comedy al&s;o to the entire &s;atisfaction of her new votaries. From her impe|rial throne, in which &s;he was borne by four por|ters, &s;he de&s;cended to the right hand of the pre&s;i|dent of the convention, and by a decree received the fraternal ki&s;s, as &s;oon as the procureur of the commune, who attended as high prie&s;t, or ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, had announced her negative and po&s;itive character; "fir&s;t, that &s;he was not, like the objects of the ancient wor&s;hip, a cold and ina|nimate image; and next, that &s;he was a ma&s;ter|piece of nature; and that her &s;acred form had &s;o enflamed every heart, that only one univer&s;al cry was heard, "No more prie&s;ts, and no other gods!"</P>
<P>When the deputies arrived at the temple, the Godde&s;s of Rea&s;on introduced them to the God|de&s;s of Liberty, who came out of the hou&s;e of Philo&s;ophy, to receive their homage, and be&s;tow

her benediction. The enemies of the revolution encouraged the&s;e follies, which the patriot di&s;a|vowed and lamented: and the philo&s;opher would only have &s;miled at the&s;e tran&s;ient puerilities, had they not been mixed with atrocity and crimes. Alas! the re&s;pect for Rea&s;on was as fleeting as the re&s;pect for other &s;trange gods; for her altars were &s;oon de&s;erted, and her high prie&s;ts, and the divinity her&s;elf, were &s;oon after conducted amid&s;t the ap|plau&s;es of the people to the guillotine. Immedi|ately after the regeneration of the metropolitan, tho&s;e who felt the &s;ame conviction of its nece&s;&s;ity made confe&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, and applied for the conventional ble&s;&s;ing. This conviction neverthe|le&s;s was far from being general in either profe&s;&s;ion; for though the con&s;titutional clergy were attached to the cau&s;e of liberty, and rejoiced in the regene|ration of their country, they did not imagine that the belief of reward in a future &s;tate would make a le&s;s virtuous citizen of the pre&s;ent. This coun|ter-revolutionary ob&s;tinacy was held in great in|dignation. Though the commune had called on Rea&s;on, like the prie&s;ts of Baal, "from morning until noon," the votaries at her &s;hrine were few and &s;olitary, and it became nece&s;&s;ary for the honour of the godde&s;s, that more revolutionary mea&s;ures &s;hould be pur&s;ued. Accordingly, attended by the committees of the &s;ections, and the popular &s;ocie|ties of Paris, the municipality appeared a &s;econd time at the bar of the convention, where, after a philippic again&s;t the unrecanting clergy, they de|manded the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of their &s;alaries, and that tho&s;e who believed in "the tales of augurs &s;hould pay them." The convention, who probably had as little faith in augurs as the commune, had how|ever more charity, and deferred the &s;entence of fa|mine, which the municipality had decreed. The

commune, though it did not &s;ucceed in the attack on the prie&s;thood, was more &s;ucce&s;sful in its at|tacks on the church. The word of order was i&s;|&s;ued, and the &s;treets of Paris were filled with mock religious proce&s;&s;ions. The mo&s;t ludicrous ma&s;|querades pre&s;ented them&s;elves in every quarter; pioneers and artillery-men led the march, clothed in the &s;urplices of the inferior clergy; the national guard were arrayed in the habits of the prie&s;ts; the revolutionary citizens of the &s;ection were ve&s;ted in garments &s;till more co&s;tly; the revolutionary la|dies and the prie&s;te&s;&s;es of Rea&s;on had &s;anctified them&s;elves with the dre&s;&s;es belonging to the Vir|gin, and St. Frances and St. Bridget; and the re|volutionary committee had re&s;erved for their own decoration, with great prudence, all the garments of fine gold, embroidery and jewels, while the caps of the prie&s;ts and the mitres were placed on the heads of the hor&s;es employed in dragging the&s;e weighty &s;poils, which were to be pre&s;ented to the convention. The&s;e offerings con&s;i&s;ted of cro&s;&s;es, &s;uns, va&s;es, chandeliers, and cha&s;es, apo&s;tles and &s;aints in gold and &s;ilver, St. Anthony and his pig, St. Roche and his dog, and all the other &s;aints re|gi&s;tered in the calendar who were found to be of the &s;ame metallic worth. From the convention, after undergoing the &s;entence of condemnation for ari&s;tocratical and counter-revolutionary principles, they were &s;ent to be regenerated at the mint, and make expiation for the long &s;eries of impo&s;itions they had been practi&s;ing on the world, by becom|ing under a new form, the protectors of liberty and the republic.</P>

The figures engraved on this &s;acred uten&s;il were &s;ingular enough for a &s;aint.

In this madne&s;s again&s;t &s;u|per&s;tition &s;ome method was ob&s;erved. Almo&s;t every monument that bore the mark of genius, every relic that could contribute to the progre&s;s of the arts, was pre&s;erved with care, and depo&s;ited in places of &s;afety.

<P>The great depo&s;itory at St. Denis neverthele&s;s &s;uffered from this reforming rage.

The bodies of the&s;e monarchs and heroes were not treat|ed with equal re&s;pect; for, as the edict had gone forth again&s;t every ve&s;tige of royalty, and every mark or remnant of ari&s;tocracy, the tombs in which they had been for ages quietly inurned were forced to open their ponderous jaws; and tho&s;e fu|rious Jacobins, wor&s;e than "the helli&s;h rout that tore the Thracian bard in Rhodope," had the &s;a|tisfaction to &s;ee the bones and a&s;hes of the long line of their Charles's Henries, and Louis; of their Cond&eacute;s, Montmorencies, and Turennes, be|fore

<P>One of the pretences for this violation of the dead, which was general around Paris, and in &s;ome of the neighbouring departments, was the want of the coffins that enclo&s;ed them to make bullets for the u&s;e of the army. The cemeteries were there|fore called the revolutionary lead-mines.

The &s;truggles which took place previou&s;ly to the 31&s;t of May between the republicans and the con|&s;pirators, together with the defeat of the northern armies, and the defection of Dumourier, had di|verted the attention of government from the dan|gers by which they were menaced in the Vend&eacute;e. Of this war we yet know but little, and what we do know is only the hi&s;tory written by the party which per&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>Of all the evils which infe&s;t mankind, tho&s;e oc|ca&s;ioned by war are the mo&s;t de&s;tructive. The hurricane, the earthquake, and the volcano, tho&s;e convul&s;ions in nature which &s;hake the earth to its ba&s;is, and &s;eem to threaten it with annihilation, are not to be compared with the &s;courges of war. We read of cities be&s;ieged and taken by &s;torm, without &s;ympathizing very deeply in the hi&s;tory. We &s;ee neither the in&s;idious mine which &s;hatters a thou&s;and limbs at one blow, nor hear the cannon and the bomb, which perform the work of de&s;truction more openly. The &s;oldier climbing precipices, or &s;caling walls, to fall with indi&s;criminate rage on the old, the infant, and the defencele&s;s, and to con|vert flouri&s;hing cities into one va&s;t cemetery, is only a being of romance to tho&s;e who have lived at a di&s;tance from &s;uch &s;cenes, and the terror of who&s;e days has glided away in tranquillity. When the laws of war according to the regulations of ci|vilized &s;ociety are ob&s;erved, the mi&s;eries are &s;till tremendous: the laws of nature are perverted; it is the young, not the old, that de&s;cend fir&s;t to the tomb, and all the dear and tender relations of life are broken&mdash;the father laments his &s;on&mdash;the wife the hu&s;band torn from them to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of ambition or cruelty&mdash;whole countries are depopu|lated,

<P>If &s;uch are the evils attendant on war when men murder each other without provocation and without re&s;entment; when they &s;carcely know either the cau&s;e of the di&s;pute which brought them into the field, or for whom they are going to &s;hed their blood; what mu&s;t be the horror of that conflict where every regulation of humanity is con&s;idered as con&s;piracy and trea&s;on, where every action be|comes laudable in proportion as it becomes fero|cious, where murder is the only mark of bravery, and where extermination alone is conque&s;t!</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of the royali&s;ts after the events of the 10th of Augu&s;t to the epocha of Dumourier's defection, had remained unnoticed; nor was it till they had rai&s;ed a mo&s;t formidable camp and menaced Nantes, Angers, and other cities, and i&s;&s;ued their formal manife&s;toes demanding the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the prie&s;thood, nobility, and royalty, that any effective mea&s;ures were taken to repre&s;s them. The fir&s;t generals that were &s;ent again&s;t them, who were Berruyer, Marie, and Ligonier, acted, it is &s;aid, as if they were their allies, rather than their enemies; and Quetinau, who &s;ucceeded them, is accu&s;ed of having &s;urrendered Touars, with the magazines which it contained, and an army of four thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The&s;e defections on the one &s;ide, and the vic|tories of the royali&s;ts on the other, at length rou&s;ed the convention, who decreed that an army of three hundred thou&s;and men &s;hould be rai&s;ed to &s;uccour what they called the patriots in the Vend&eacute;e, who were oppo&s;ed by the robbers. As this &s;eemed to be an extra-&s;ervice, great rewards were given to tho&s;e who would enli&s;t to go and a&s;&s;i&s;t "their bre|thren;" but mo&s;t of the&s;e heroes, who were paid

While the&s;e di&s;graces befel the armies on the we&s;tern &s;ide, Nantes, which was be&s;ieged by an army of forty thou&s;and men, was defended with five thou&s;and, by Canclaux, who by the prudence and vigour of his operations &s;aved the province of Brittany, and gained &s;everal important victories.

<P>The royali&s;ts, encouraged by their &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and finding them&s;elves &s;o well &s;econded by the&s;e gene|rals, marched on the 27th of July towards Angers, and to a bridge which was an important pa&s;s, called the bridge of C&eacute;. Orders were given to evacuate this po&s;t, as had been done in preceding in&s;tances. But contrary mea&s;ures being taken by a deputy in mi&s;&s;ion, and other di&s;po&s;itions being made by gene|ral Tune, both places were &s;aved, and for the fir&s;t time a victory was obtained. This general gained a &s;till greater advantage, and a fortnight after he was broke.</P>
<P>The evacuation of Cholet by the royali&s;ts would have been the con&s;equence of their defeat; but when general Rey was propo&s;ing to take advantage of his victory, an imperial edict of the &s;ame &s;an&s;|culotte general forced him to a retreat. As a re|ward for &s;ucce&s;&s;es which Rey afterwards gained, he al&s;o was broke; and his adjutant, who came to Pa|ris to plead for him, was thrown into the dungeon of the Conciergerie.</P>
<P>The&s;e plans of military operations were not likely to be attended with much &s;ucce&s;s, and have appeared at all times my&s;terious. Phillipeaux, in his &s;trictures on this war, calls it a &s;trange pheno|menon for hi&s;tory, that the government &s;hould have looked calmly on, whil&s;t tho&s;e who gained victo|ries were di&s;graced, and tho&s;e who&s;e only prowe&s;s had con&s;i&s;ted in converting whole armies compo&s;ed of &s;ome of the brave&s;t and be&s;t di&s;ciplined troops in the republic, into heaps of carca&s;es, were ca|re&s;&s;ed and continued in command.

in his letter to the committee of public &s;afety, a&s;|&s;ures them that the two generals Ron&s;in and Ro&s;|&s;ignol had butchered from forty to fifty thou&s;and patriots.</P>
<P>But time reveals mo&s;t my&s;teries. At this pe|riod the con&s;pirators in Paris were more in dread of the re&s;entment of the departments than they were of the army of the royali&s;ts. Of the various calumnies which they invented again&s;t the deputies who had fled from Paris, that of joining the royal|i&s;ts was the mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated; and while the pro&s;cribed deputies were held up to the public as the &s;upporters and actors in a cau&s;e which all parties agreed to call rebellion, the con&s;pirators found them&s;elves ju&s;tified in taking the mea&s;ures be&s;t fitted to exterminate the only rivals they had to dread. Had the royali&s;ts been defeated, and the rebellion cru&s;hed, the calumny would have been di&s;covered, and all pretence for puni&s;hment taken away. It was the intere&s;t therefore of the u&s;urpers to menace the people with the vengeance of royali&s;m and federali&s;m united; and none were better calcu|lated to fulfil their intentions, than tho&s;e inexperi|enced and profligate men, who had the mo&s;t re|markable talents for procuring the defeat of the armies they commanded.</P>
<P>Whether or no this be the real explanation of that which has been deemed &s;o my&s;terious, mu&s;t be left to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to penetrate into this labyrinth. When we &s;ee the hi&s;tory of the war of the Vend&eacute;e written by the royali&s;ts them&s;elves, it is probable that they will &s;ay, that their own valour, and the goodne&s;s of the cau&s;e in which they were engaged, gave them the&s;e victories. In yielding its full force to this expla|nation, and &s;uppo&s;ing that the conventional armies were defeated by braver troops, it will yet remain

unexplained, why, of two cla&s;&s;es of conventional generals, tho&s;e who beat and tho&s;e who were beat|en, the former &s;hould have found either impri&s;on|ment, or the &s;caffold, and the others prodigality of favours.</P>
<P>The u&s;urpers having &s;ucceeded in their criminal de&s;igns again&s;t the republican party, now found it nece&s;&s;ary to rid them&s;elves of the royali&s;ts, whom they had hitherto made u&s;eful to their de&s;igns. The latter end of Augu&s;t they formed a different plan for the remainder of the campaign, which con&s;i&s;ted in attacking at once the royali&s;ts from every point, and fini&s;hing the conte&s;t as it were at a &s;ingle blow. The army on the northern &s;ide was committed to Ro&s;&s;ignol and Ron&s;in, and the revolutionary le|gions and the army on the we&s;tern coa&s;t were en|tru&s;ted to Lechelle. However well this plan might have been combined, the fir&s;t &s;pecimen tho&s;e who were to execute it gave of obedience to their in|&s;tructions was to &s;uffer the in&s;urgents to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land of Noirmoutier, Machecoul, and other places, and evacuate Montaigu, where they abandoned immen&s;e magazines of every &s;ort, and the army was reduced to &s;leep in the open air; while their ignorant or treacherous leaders kept at a convenient di&s;tance, &s;urrounded by actre&s;&s;es, courte&s;ans, and all the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of an ea&s;tern camp, with all the vulgarity of the lowe&s;t profli|gacy.</P>
<P>This defeat was followed by many others, and by the capture al&s;o of &s;everal towns. The expe|dition which Lechelle made was &s;o contrived, that his troops had not the means of effecting a retreat. The protection of the city of Nantes was entru&s;ted to him, and he &s;uffered a body of &s;ome hundred royali&s;ts to cut off its provi&s;ions for &s;everal days in the face of his whole army; and when the repre&s;en|tatives

of the people reque&s;ted him to &s;end a de|tachment to re&s;cue a convoy of flour which had fallen into the enemy's hands, he treated the appli|cation with contempt.</P>
<P>While this general was di&s;po&s;ing of the conven|tional armies on the we&s;tern &s;ide, his colleagues Ro&s;&s;ignol and Ron&s;in, the latter of whom having &s;een &s;ome &s;ervice took the title of <HI>mini&s;ter-general,</HI> were preparing to execute the plan of the campaign on the other &s;ide. In&s;tead of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to attack the enemy, they halted for &s;ome time at Saumur and Tours, &s;o as to let the royali&s;t army acquire its proper con&s;i&s;tency. To &s;urround the enemy was the great object; and orders were &s;ent to the commanders of the &s;outhern armies at Niort, Lu|&ccedil;on, and Partenay, to co-operate. The event of this arrangement was, conformably to the ordinary &s;y&s;tem, the total defeat of the&s;e divi&s;ions; and on the 18th of September &s;o admirably were the in|&s;tructions obeyed, that fifty thou&s;and men at Coran and near the pa&s;&s;age of the Loire at C&eacute;, command|ed by Ron&s;in and Ro&s;&s;ignol, were attacked by an army con&s;i&s;ting of three thou&s;and royali&s;ts only; and what could appear &s;carcely credible, the <HI>&s;an&s;cu|lotte</HI> generals had &s;o ingeniou&s;ly arranged their troops, that they were not only defeated by this incon&s;iderable detachment, but the &s;laughter was immen&s;e.</P>
<P>This extraordinary defeat will not, I am told, &s;urpri&s;e any military man, when he hears that the conventional army was arranged for battle in a &s;ingle column, in the defiles of Coran, with eight men in front, and pre&s;enting a flank to the enemy, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights, of nearly twelve miles in extent. The artillery, in&s;tead of being placed on tho&s;e heights, under the protection of a &s;trong detachment, as was propo&s;ed by the guides,
<PB N="237" REF="031634_0236_0FED637F3100EC00">
and tho&s;e who knew the country, was placed at the head of this long column, and of cour&s;e fell into the hands of the royali&s;ts, who turned it again&s;t the conventional troops, and made great carnage. In the mean time, detachments of the enemy gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights without difficulty and without re&s;i&s;tance, ma&s;&s;acred the troops below, taking them in flank, and made them, from the confu&s;ion into which they were thrown, the exter|minators of each other.</P>
<P>The generals who commanded this expedition were, in the mean time, regaling them&s;elves at a di&s;tance, with their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;ome of whom were afterwards godde&s;&s;es of rea&s;on; but they had the prudence to de&s;troy their magazines, in&s;tead of leaving them as u&s;ual at the di&s;po&s;ition of the ene|my. The harve&s;t of that part of the country was ju&s;t then gathered in, and would have &s;ufficed them for a whole year, had they &s;ecured it agreeably to the orders of the convention.</P>
<P>This new plan of a campaign was not attended with more happy &s;ucce&s;s than the former, and the my&s;tery which embarra&s;&s;ed Phillippeaux became &s;till more inexplicable. It would be difficult in|deed to define what could be the motive which led the government to look with &s;o much complacency on this continued &s;y&s;tem of defeat and carnage, did we not &s;ee what combinations of crooked policy were put into execution to &s;ecure the purpo&s;es of ferocious ambition. The party of the Gironde, being completely cru&s;hed, gave them no longer any inquietude, and it became now the intere&s;t of the u&s;urpers to bring the war to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue. The two former plans not having &s;ucceeded, the committee of public &s;afety publi&s;hed another. The&s;e con&s;pirators had &s;een how efficacious their decrees had been in &s;everal in&s;tances, and therefore
<PB N="238" REF="031634_0237_0FED642678790BE8">
imagined a mode of putting an end to this de&s;truc|tive conte&s;t by decreeing that it &s;hould fini&s;h on the 20th of October, and that the generals &s;hould re|ceive the triumphal crown on the fir&s;t of Novem|ber following. We &s;hould be inclined to &s;mile at this exce&s;s of folly, if that di&s;po&s;ition were not &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed by indignation and horror at the atrocious orders which were given for this purpo&s;e to their armies, "that de&s;olation and indi&s;criminate de&s;truc|tion mu&s;t now become the order of the day."</P>
<P>The decree having &s;tated in expre&s;s terms, "that all the retreats, mills, and ovens of the robbers &s;hould be de&s;troyed and burnt, and that the mini&s;|ter of war &s;hould be ordered to &s;end combu&s;tible matter for that purpo&s;e;" and the proclamation of the convention having invited the &s;oldiers of liberty to exterminate all the&s;e robbers, before the end of October; "the &s;oldiers of liberty," and all tho&s;e who were invited to the accompli&s;hment of this new plan of the campaign, prepared to put it into execution. Neither the committee of u&s;urpation, nor the convention had been nice in the definition of their terms, and therefore the &s;oldiers of liberty undertook to con&s;true them at their plea&s;ure. Ac|cordingly, every hou&s;e of the peaceful inhabitant came within the definition of the retreat of a robber, &s;ince every inhabitant of the Vend&eacute;e was con&s;ider|ed as a robber, and con&s;equently his dwelling mu&s;t be a retreat.</P>
<P>Whether or no the in&s;truments of this barbarous and execrable policy rea&s;oned after this manner, they certainly became practical logicians; and the army, in addition to their hundred thou&s;and bayo|nets, were armed with a hundred thou&s;and torches; and having been pronounced by the u&s;urpers the executors of their ju&s;t vengeance, the property of the armed royali&s;t and the peaceable republican be|came
<PB N="239" REF="031634_0238_0FED63C82E6198A0">
alike objects of their rapacity and fury; and indi&s;criminate ma&s;&s;acre and plunder were literally the order of the day.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t days of the revolution, when liberty and philo&s;ophy went hand in hand together, what a moral revolution was in&s;tantly effected throughout Europe, by the &s;ublime and immortal principles which this great change &s;eemed about to introduce into government! But what eternal regrets mu&s;t the lovers of liberty feel, that her cau&s;e &s;hould have fallen into the hands of mon&s;ters ignorant of her charms, by whom &s;he has been transformed into a Fury, who, brandi&s;hing her &s;naky whips and torches, has enlarged the limits of wickedne&s;s, and driven us back into regions of guilt hitherto unknown!</P>
<P>So unexampled are the crimes which have been committed, that it will require &s;tronger evidence than the hi&s;torian is commonly bound to produce, to per&s;uade future generations of their reality. Alas! but a faint outline has been drawn of this terrifying picture, over which the friend of liberty would, if it were po&s;&s;ible, like the recording angel, drop a tear, that might blot it out for ever.&mdash;"If &s;ome &s;weet oblivious antidote" could drive from my brain the remembrance of the&s;e things, and from my heart the feelings that oppre&s;s it, as well as from the knowledge of the world, I &s;hould be tempted to &s;natch from the enemies of Liberty the triumph they a&s;&s;ume from this mournful hi&s;tory. But the&s;e horrors mu&s;t &s;tain the page of the revo|lution for ever. The bloody characters mu&s;t re|main indelible on the wall, a dreadful, but in&s;truc|tive le&s;&s;on to future ages, and to tho&s;e countries, which are de&s;tined to labour through revolutions, and who will learn, while they contemplate this
<PB N="240" REF="031634_0239_0FED64044F026840">
terrific chart, how to avoid the rocks on which Li|berty has been nearly wrecked.</P>
<P>Dreadful indeed has been the cri&s;is we have pa&s;|&s;ed! yet it is &s;ome con&s;olation, amid&s;t this mighty ma&s;s of evil, that France is at length beginning to learn wi&s;dom from the things &s;he has &s;uffered. France no longer looks around to find apologies for the crimes that have been committed: &s;he her&s;elf holds up the criminals to the world. She boa&s;ts not of her victories over Europe armed again&s;t her rights; but &s;he triumphs in the conque&s;ts &s;he has made over her&s;elf. It is &s;ome relief, while I am &s;truggling through the gloomy hi&s;tory of the&s;e horrors, that I &s;ee again the dawn of that glorious light which will cha&s;e them away. The la&s;t &s;troke has been given to that vile and degrading &s;y&s;tem, which ignoble u&s;urpers had framed: we may now approach the altar of Liberty with confidence and hope; the hideous &s;pectres that haunted it have fled for ever; and its incen&s;e in future will ri&s;e grate|ful to heaven, and &s;pread fragrance over a regene|rated land.</P>

<P>THE repre&s;entatives of the French people under&s;igned, con&s;idering that, amid&s;t events which excite the indignation of the whole republic, they cannot remain &s;ilent with re&s;pect to the attempts committed again&s;t the national repre&s;entation, with|out feeling them&s;elves chargeable with the mo&s;t &s;hameful pu&s;illanimity, or with becoming &s;till more guilty &s;harers in the crime:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that the &s;ame con&s;pirators, who, from the very period in which the republic was proclaimed, had never di&s;continued their attacks on the national repre&s;entation, have at length filled up the mea&s;ure of their crimes, in violating the maje&s;|ty of the people in the per&s;ons of their repre&s;enta|tives, by driving &s;ome to &s;eek their &s;afety in &s;light, by impri&s;oning others, and forcing the re&s;t to bend their necks under the yoke of the mo&s;t in&s;ulting tyranny:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that the heads of this faction, em|boldened by long impunity, growing &s;trong through exce&s;s of impudence, and relying on the number of their accomplices, have &s;eized on all the branches of the executive government, on the trea&s;ury, on the means of defence and the re&s;ources of the na|tion
<PB N="242" REF="031634_0241_0FED6392F24FEDB8">
which they di&s;po&s;e of at their plea&s;ure, and which they are employing to effect its ruin:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that they have at their command the chiefs of the military force, and the con&s;tituted au|thorities of Paris; that the majority of the inhabi|tants of this city, intimidated by the exce&s;&s;es of a faction which the law is unable to reach, affright|ed by pro&s;criptions with which they are continually threatened, find them&s;elves not only incapable of de&s;troying the machinations of the con&s;pirators, but often, through re&s;pect to the law, which enjoins obedience to the con&s;tituted authorities, compelled even to become as it were accomplices in their crimes:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that &s;o great is the oppre&s;&s;ion under which the national convention labours, that not one of its decrees can be executed, unle&s;s it be ap|proved or dictated by the heads of this faction; that the con&s;pirators have in fact &s;et them&s;elves up as the only organ of the public will, and that they have reduced the re&s;t of the national repre&s;entation to be the pa&s;&s;ive in&s;truments of their plea&s;ure:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that the national convention, after having been forced to inve&s;t with unlimited powers tho&s;e commi&s;&s;aries who have been &s;ent into the de|partments and to the armies, and who have been cho&s;en exclu&s;ively by this faction, has been unable to check the arbitrary acts which they have commit|ted, or even to prote&s;t again&s;t the incendiary and di&s;organizing principles which the majority among&s;t them have propagated:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that not only has the national con|vention been rendered incapable of pro&s;ecuting the de&s;poilers of the public wealth, or the wretches who have given orders for murder and pillage; but even the&s;e &s;ame con&s;pirators, after having &s;ailed in their de&s;igns on the night of the 10th and the 11th

<P>Con&s;idering that at this la&s;t epocha they beat to arms, rung the toc&s;in, and fired the alarm guns; that the barriers of the city were &s;hut, all commu|nication cut off, the &s;ecrecy of letters violated, the hall of the convention blockaded by an armed force of more than 60,000 men; that a formidable artil|lery was &s;tationed at every avenue of the national palace, that furnaces were fixed to &s;erve the guns with red hot balls, and that every preparation was made for an attack; that the battalions enrolled for the Vend&eacute;e, but detained for this purpo&s;e in the neighbourhood of Paris, were among&s;t the number of the be&s;iegers; that ruffians in the pay of the con|&s;pirators, and fitted for the execution of their bloody projects, occupied the mo&s;t important po&s;ts and the pa&s;&s;ages of the hall; that they were openly reward|ed for their zeal by di&s;tributions of provi&s;ions and money; that at the moment when the national con|vention pre&s;ented it&s;elf in full a&s;&s;embly at the ave|nue of the national palace to enjoin the military to withdraw, the commander, inve&s;ted by the con&s;pi|rators with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute dictator&s;hip, had the audacity to in&s;i&s;t that the pro&s;cribed deputies &s;hould be delivered up to the vengeance of the people; and that on the refu&s;al of the convention he had the im|pudence to call to arms, and put in danger the lives of the repre&s;entatives of the French people:</P>
<P>Con&s;idering, finally, that it is by machinations &s;uch as the&s;e that they have forced from the conven|tion, or rather from a &s;ixth part of the members who compo&s;e it, a decree which pronounced the ar|bitrary &s;eizure and deprived of their functions, with|out accu&s;ation, without evidence, in contempt of all forms, and through the mo&s;t criminal violation

of the rights of man and the national &s;overeignty, thirty-two repre&s;entatives marked out and pro&s;crib|ed by the con&s;pirators them&s;elves:</P>
<P>They declare to their con&s;tituents, to the citi|zens of every department, and to the French peo|ple, who&s;e rights and &s;overeignty have been thus &s;hamefully violated, that from the moment in which the unity of the national repre&s;entation has been broken by an act of violence, of which the hi&s;tory of nations has never yet furni&s;hed an example, they have neither been able nor have they thought it their duty to take any part in the deliberations of the a&s;|&s;embly:</P>
<P>That driven by the&s;e unhappy circum&s;tances to the impo&s;&s;ibility of oppo&s;ing by their individual ex|ertions the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;tacle to the &s;ucce&s;s of the con&s;pirators, they can only proclaim to the whole republic the hateful &s;cenes of which they have been both the witne&s;&s;es and the victims.</P>

<P>REPUBLICANS, you are acquainted with the dangers which threaten the public weal. They are &s;o great that we mu&s;t either take arms and die in the field of honour, or &s;ubmit to the &s;troke of the a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;in in our homes. We mu&s;t &s;ave the republic, or peri&s;h with it: we mu&s;t crouch to anarchy or de&s;troy it. We mu&s;t re&s;ume our rank among the nations, or yield the precedence to the &s;lave of the A&s;iatic de&s;pot, or the uncivilized Tartarian horde.</P>
<P>When the national repre&s;entation, by lo&s;ing its unity, becomes virtually di&s;&s;olved; when the de|partments
<PB N="245" REF="031634_0244_0FED63D99B0F6DE0">
who&s;e deputies are &s;hamefully arre&s;t|ed, con&s;ider them&s;elves in reality as no longer re|pre&s;ented; when the maje&s;ty of the people is vio|lated by the attempts committed again&s;t its manda|tories; when the faction which is longing for the return of royalty in&s;olently domineers over that cor|rupted city by which we are menaced, there is no longer any room for he&s;itation.</P>
<P>Shame and &s;lavery, or let us fly to Paris! You wa&s;te the precious moments which are yet left to apply the remedy, in deliberating on the di&s;ea&s;e. Your country, your liberties, your honour as French|men, your&s;elves, your wives, and children, are lo&s;t. Neither public nor private fortunes any lon|ger exi&s;t: you lo&s;e four years of toil, of care, of labour, of watchings, of battles, and torrents of blood &s;hed in defence of the mo&s;t glorious of cau&s;es. The&s;e will be inevitably lo&s;t, and it is but a vile handful of factious traitors who are deciding on the liberty of twenty-five millions of men.</P>
<P>In this critical and de&s;perate &s;ituation one gene|ral voice is heard from the centre to the confines of the republic. It proclaims that the nation is rou&s;ed, to conquer or die. The nation is rou&s;ed; let us march! Mar&s;eilles calls on you; Mar&s;eilles which has unque&s;tionably &s;o much right to your confidence, and &s;o deep a concern in the &s;upport of this revolution, of which &s;he has given &s;o noble an example. This appeal is the la&s;t u&s;e which &s;he wi&s;hes to make of the liberty of &s;peech in order to promulgate the great re&s;olutions &s;he has adopted, and the deci&s;ive mea&s;ures &s;he has taken. Far from a warlike people, far from a nation of &s;oldiers, who wait only the &s;ignal for battle, be the vain tin&s;el of words! To dare, and to act, is all we have to do.</P>
<P>Let us &s;trike; and let Frenchmen, &s;o long cha|racteri&s;ed as frivolous, &s;hew the world, that if they
<PB N="246" REF="031634_0245_0FED639147060110">
de&s;erved the imputation while under the controul of kings, they have now re&s;umed their antient habi|tudes, and are become independent and formidable like the Gauls and the Franks, from whom they glory in being de&s;cended.</P>
<P>Republicans, who pant for liberty and dete&s;t licentiou&s;ne&s;s, who abhor royalty, and de&s;ire the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the republic united and undivid|ed, league yaur&s;elves with the Mar&s;eillois, who breathe the &s;ame vows already made by a con&s;i|derable number of departments. They declare that the pre&s;ent political &s;tate of Paris is equiva|lent to a declaration of civil war again&s;t the whole republic.</P>
<P>They accu&s;e, and pre&s;ent to you as guilty of all the di&s;orders that afflict France, Philip d' Orleans and his faction; the frantic mon&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marat.</NOTE> who&s;e venal howlings are his purcha&s;e, and who&s;e name would &s;ully this declaration; the den of the Jacobins of Paris; the &s;editious and factious men who are &s;pread|ing them&s;elves throughout the republic, and excit|ing it to commotion. Mar&s;eilles points them out as common enemies, who have been wi&s;hing to lead us to the brink of the precipice, to adulterate their mon&s;trous but mea&s;ured &s;y&s;tem of anarchy with a king of their own creating: and this king would have been the mo&s;t di&s;honoured being in exi&s;tence; a man overwhelmed with debt, rich in di&s;grace, debauchery, and ba&s;ene&s;s; a man whom no virtuous citizen would admit among his &s;ervants, and who would be driven by them&s;elves from their &s;ociety; a man, in &s;hort, who is impri&s;oned within our walls, and of who&s;e &s;peedy and &s;evere puni&s;h|ment we are equally de&s;irous.</P>
<P>We invite you to &s;ign with us this ju&s;t and in|di&s;pen&s;able covenant which we propo&s;e for the
<PB N="247" REF="031634_0246_0FED64072185CD68">
public &s;afety, and to wipe off the &s;tain of &s;o many injuries.</P>
<P>Mar&s;eilles, therefore, declares, that it is in a legal &s;tate of re&s;i&s;tance to oppre&s;&s;ion, and that it is authori&s;ed by the law to make war again&s;t the &s;e|ditious:</P>
<P N="2">2. That it can no longer acknowledge a conven|tion who&s;e unity is violated, to be the national re|pre&s;entation; and that at that period only, when the deputies of the people &s;hall be fully and freely rein&s;tated in their functions, the nation will obey its orders with confidence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion:</P>
<P N="3">3. That the throne of anarchy has been rai&s;ed on the wrecks of the throne you have overturned, and that tyranny is dete&s;table in proportion to the corruption of tho&s;e who are prompted to exer|ci&s;e it:</P>
<P N="4">4. That the con&s;pirators have already proceeded to di&s;&s;olve the national convention by reducing and di&s;organizing it, and exciting it to acts of folly, ra&s;hne&s;s, and di&s;order; and that the French nation can con&s;ider tho&s;e acts which are promulgated by a portion of its repre&s;entatives who yet keep their &s;eats, only as evidences of the tyranny exerci&s;ed over &s;ome by the perfidy and wickedne&s;s of others:</P>
<P N="5">5. That the impri&s;onment of a great number of deputies of the convention is an attempt made in the delirium of guilt, an act which po&s;terity will &s;carcely believe, if its authenticity were not proved by the record of the ju&s;t vengeance we have &s;worn to take, and which you will aid us in inflicting:</P>
<P N="6">6. That the good citizens who &s;till inhabit Paris are invited to a&s;&s;i&s;t, as much as lies in their power, the united efforts which we are going to make for the public welfare, and to let the whole weight of the re&s;pon&s;ibility re&s;t on the heads of the con&s;pira|tors, which we declare are forfeited by their crimes:</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="248" REF="031634_0247_0FED63A3F2B2AB10">
7. That the domineering faction at Paris has compelled the departments to lead into that city, &s;o long the prey and &s;port of ambitious men, the mi|litary force which is the la&s;t re&s;ource of the &s;ove|reign people; declaring at the &s;ame time that the united force under the direction of the departments, and in conformity to their wi&s;hes, is de&s;tined to ex|tripate tho&s;e who&s;e criminal hands have been em|ployed in effecting the ruin of their country:</P>
<P N="8">8. That every man capable of bearing arms is &s;ummoned, in the name of the law, in that of his own and the public intere&s;t, and in the name of hu|manity, to join his efforts in &s;trengthening the dyke which we are oppo&s;ing to this de&s;olating torrent; that he may avoid being &s;wept away into that aby&s;s which the anarchi&s;ts and infamous plunderers have opened before us:</P>
<P N="9">9. That by decreeing a levy of a &s;tated number of men ready to join in ma&s;s to de&s;troy utterly every faction in its &s;trong-hold, the Mar&s;eillois, who are &s;olicitous to fini&s;h a revolution which they began, and make the example which they have ju&s;t given an object of imitation, call upon every citi|zen to join them who is anxious to de&s;erve well of mankind.</P>
<P>They have taken this preliminary &s;tep only in con&s;ideration of the urgency of the mea&s;ures to be adopted, &s;ubmitting them to the examination and the approbation of the whole &s;overeign body, with|out pretending to &s;et bounds to the zeal of the ge|nerous defenders of their country, who &s;hall volun|tarily come forward to &s;trengthen the phalanx of liberty. They hope that it will increa&s;e in its march, and that every citizen anxious for the public weal will bear a part:</P>
<P N="10">10. That in the colours of this army the &s;oldiers of the country &s;hall read in&s;cribed the accompli&s;h|ment
<PB N="249" REF="031634_0248_0FED63A7EBAA3CE8">
of every good law: "The republic united and undivided, re&s;pect for per&s;ons and property;" words of con&s;olation already graven on every heart:</P>
<P N="11">11. That we appeal to God, and to our arms, again&s;t the attempts that have been made on the unity of the national repre&s;entation, again&s;t the violence which has been exerci&s;ed on the per&s;onal liberty of our &s;pecial deputies, again&s;t the con&s;pi|racies de&s;tructive of liberty, from which the &s;uper|intendance of Providence has delivered us, of which Mar&s;eilles is pur&s;uing the accomplices who under|took to execute the mo&s;t horrible deeds within its walls. A popular tribunal, the guardian of e&s;ta|bli&s;hed and well regulated order, is carrying on the pro&s;ecution of the con&s;pirators, notwith&s;tanding the ob&s;tacles with which it is &s;urrounded.

<P>It is thus that the city of Mar&s;eilles, in addition to the motives ari&s;ing from the general danger of the republic, joins the detail of the particular griev|ances which affect its tranquillity, and explains the nece&s;&s;ity it is under of &s;ilencing its calumniators, who, in de&s;pair at not having &s;ucceeded in kindling the torch of di&s;cord among us, have dared to pre|&s;ent it to the convention as the light of truth.</P>

<P>THE accu&s;ation again&s;t me is founded wholly on the &s;uppo&s;ition of my being an accomplice with men called con&s;pirators. My friend&s;hip for a few of tho&s;e per&s;ons is prior to the political circum|&s;tances which form the charge again&s;t them. The corr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pondence I held with them by an in|termediate channel, at the time of their depar|ture from Paris, is altogether foreign to &s;tate af|fairs. I have had in truth no political corre&s;pond|ence; and in this re&s;pect I might ab&s;olutely deny the charge; yet, although I cannot be called upon to give an account of my private affections, I may
<PB N="251" REF="031634_0250_0FED63D51EB61750">
glory in them, as I do in the whole of my conduct, and I have nothing to conceal from the world.</P>
<P>I declare then, that I have received te&s;timonies of regret on account of my impri&s;onment, and was informed that Duperret had two letters for me; but whether written before or after my friends had left Paris, whether from one or two of them, I am al|together ignorant, &s;ince the&s;e letters have never reached me. At another time, I was earne&s;tly conjured to e&s;cape from my pri&s;on, and received offers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the attempt, and to convey me to whatever place I &s;hould think proper. I was deterred from accepting the&s;e offers, from con|&s;iderations both of duty and honour; of duty, be|cau&s;e I would not injure tho&s;e to who&s;e care I was committed; of honour, &s;ince in all ca&s;es I &s;hould prefer expo&s;ing my&s;elf to the con&s;equences of every po&s;&s;ible vexation, rather than incur the appear|ances of guilt, by a flight unworthy of my cha|racter. I &s;hould not have been &s;o carele&s;s with re|gard to my &s;afety on the 31&s;t of May, had I had an intention of effecting my e&s;cape at a later pe|riod. This is the extent of my connections with my friends who fled. Undoubtedly if the commu|nication had not been interrupted between us, or if I had not been re&s;trained by my impri&s;onment, I &s;hould have endeavoured to procure information concerning them, for I know of no law that for|bids it. Alas! in what age, or among&s;t what peo|ple were tho&s;e &s;entiments of e&s;teem and fidelity which bind men to each other, ever accounted a crime? I do not pretend to decide upon the mea|&s;ures taken by tho&s;e who were pro&s;cribed: but I never will believe that tho&s;e men have intended ill, who&s;e intregrity, patrioti&s;m, and generous devotion to their country I have &s;een &s;o clearly di&s;played. If they have erred, their errors are tho&s;e of virtue;
<PB N="252" REF="031634_0251_0FED6419416E5928">
they are overcome without being degraded; they are unfortunate in my eyes, without being guilty. If I am criminal in offering vows for their &s;afety, I declare my&s;elf &s;o to the whole world. I am un|der no concern for their glory, and I willingly &s;hare in the honour of being oppre&s;&s;ed by their ene|mies. I have known the&s;e generous men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are accu&s;ed of having con&s;pired again&s;t their country. They were firm but humane republicans; they were per&s;uaded that good laws were nece&s;&s;ary to make the republic beloved by tho&s;e who had no confidence in its &s;tability: but this was indeed a more difficult ta&s;k than to murder them. The hi&s;|tory of all ages has proved that great talents are nece&s;&s;ary to lead men to virtue by good laws, while violence alone has been &s;ufficient to re&s;train them by terror, or annihilate them by death. I have heard my friends maintain that plenty, like hap|pine&s;s, could only re&s;ult from an equitable govern|ment; that the omnipotence of bayonets might produce fear, but not bread. I have &s;een them animated by the warme&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m for the happi|ne&s;s of the people, di&s;daining to flatter them, de|termined to fall rather the victims of their blind|ne&s;s, than deceive them. I own that the&s;e princi|ples and this conduct have appeared to me altoge|ther different from tho&s;e of tyrants and ambitious men, who amu&s;e the people only to en&s;lave them. It is for the&s;e rea&s;ons that I am filled with e&s;teem for the&s;e generous men. This error, if it be one, will go with me to the grave, and I &s;hall glory in fol|lowing tho&s;e whom I could not accompany thither.</P>
<P>My defence, I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, is more nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e who are de&s;irous of being in|formed, than it is to my&s;elf. Con&s;cious of having fulfilled my duties, I look to the future with &s;ecurity and confidence. My ta&s;te for &s;tudy and
<PB N="253" REF="031634_0252_0FED63CD370DD770">
my habits of retirement have kept me at a di&s;|tance both from the follies of di&s;&s;ipation, and from the bu&s;tle of intrigue. Enamoured of liberty, the value of which I learnt from reflection, I viewed the revolution with tran&s;port, per&s;uaded that it was the epocha of the &s;ubver&s;ion of de&s;poti&s;m, which I dete&s;t; of the reformation of abu&s;es, under which I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ighed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the fate of the unhappy and oppre&s;&s;ed hung upon my heart. I have fol|lowed the progre&s;s of the revolution with &s;olici|tude. I have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf on the &s;ubject with warmth; but I have never overpa&s;&s;ed the limits pre&s;cribed me by my &s;ex. Some talents perhaps, a little philo&s;ophy, a greater degree of courage, and which in times of danger did not weaken that of my hu&s;band, are probably what tho&s;e who knew me have imprudently a&s;cribed to me, and which may have contributed to make me enemies among&s;t tho&s;e by whom I was not known. Roland &s;ome|times employed me as his &s;ecretary; and the cele|brated letter to the king, for in&s;tance, was copied wholly by me. This would be a good paper enough to frame part of my indictment, if the Au&s;trians were my pro&s;ecutors, and thought proper to extend the re&s;pon&s;ibility of the mini&s;ter to his wife. But Roland had long &s;ince di&s;played his &s;entiments, and his love of great principles. The evidence of this exi&s;ts in the numerous books which he has publi&s;h|ed during the&s;e fifteen years pa&s;t. His knowledge and his integrity are eminently his own; and he had no need of a wife to become a wife and faithful mini&s;ter. Neither conferences nor cabals have ever been held at his hou&s;e. His friends, his col|leagues, whoever they were, and his acquaintances met at his table once a week, where in very pub|lic conver&s;ation they di&s;cour&s;ed openly on tho&s;e topics in which every one was intere&s;ted. On the
<PB N="254" REF="031634_0253_0FED638325FF2088">
whole, the writings of this mini&s;ter breathe through|out the love of order and peace, explaining in the mo&s;t affecting manner the be&s;t principles of morality and policy. They will for ever bear witne&s;s to his wi&s;dom, as the accounts he has given in bear witne&s;s to his integrity.</P>
<P>I return to the crime imputed to me. I ob&s;erve that I had no intimate acquaintance with Duperret. I had &s;ometimes &s;een him, while my hu&s;band was mini&s;ter, but he had not vi&s;ited me during the &s;ix months that have elap&s;ed &s;ince Roland quitted the admini&s;tration: and I might make the &s;ame remark re&s;pecting the other deputies who were our friends; which certainly does not tally with the accu&s;ation of con&s;piracy and &s;ecret under&s;tanding imputed to us. It is clear from my fir&s;t letter to Duperret, that I wrote to this deputy, only becau&s;e I found it difficult to write to any other, with the idea that he would be inclined to render me &s;ervice. My cor|re&s;pondence with him, therefore, was not a thing projected; it was not the &s;equel of any preceding connections; and it had no political view. It fur|ni&s;hed me with an opportunity of receiving intelli|gence of tho&s;e who were ab&s;ent, and with whom I was in habits of friend&s;hip, altogether independent of political con&s;iderations. Such con&s;iderations form|ed no part of the corre&s;pondence which I held with them in the fir&s;t moments of their ab&s;ence. No me|morial to this effect is brought in evidence again&s;t me. Tho&s;e which are produced, only intimate that I &s;hare in the opinions of tho&s;e who are called con|&s;pirators. This induction is founded, I own it to the world, and I glory in this conformity of &s;enti|ment; but I have never publi&s;hed the&s;e &s;entiments in any manner that can be imputed to me as a crime. In order to e&s;tabli&s;h the being an accomplice in any project, it mu&s;t be proved that advice has been given,
<PB N="255" REF="031634_0254_0FED63D12BC15AE0">
and means furni&s;hed. I have done neither; I am therefore not guilty in the eyes of the law; there is none which can condemn me; there exi&s;ts no fact for the application of any.</P>
<P>I know that in revolutions, law as well as ju&s;|tice is often forgotten; and the evidence of this is, that I am at this bar. I am indebted for this pro|&s;ecution only to tho&s;e prejudices and that violent hatred which bur&s;t forth amid&s;t great convul&s;ions, and which, in general, fix upon tho&s;e who are placed in con&s;picuous &s;ituations, or who are known to po&s;&s;e&s;s energy of character. It would have been ea&s;y for me to have avoided this trial which I fore|&s;aw; but I thought it more becoming to meet it: I thought that I owed this example to my country: I thought that if I &s;hould be condemned, I &s;hould leave to my tyrants the odium of &s;acrificing a woman who had no other crime than perhaps &s;ome talents of which &s;he &s;eldom availed her&s;elf, great zeal for the in|tere&s;ts of mankind, courage to adhere to her unfortu|nate friends, and to render homage to truth at the ha|zard of her life. Tho&s;e who have true greatne&s;s of &s;oul throw away &s;elfi&s;h feelings, remember that they belong only to the &s;pecies, and look to futurity for their reward. I belong to the virtuous and per&s;ecuted Roland. I was in habits of friend&s;hip with men whom ignorance and the jealous hatred of low, vulgar minds have pro&s;cribed and murdered. I am to peri&s;h al&s;o, becau&s;e it is con&s;i&s;tent with the principles of tyranny to &s;acrifice tho&s;e whom it has cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed, and annihilate every witne&s;s of its crimes. Under both the&s;e titles you ought to con|demn me to die, and I await my &s;entence. When innocence mounts the &s;caffold to which it is con|demned by error or wickedne&s;s, it reaches the goal of triumph. May I be the la&s;t victim that &s;hall be &s;acrificed! I &s;hall leave with joy this unhappy land,
<PB N="256" REF="031634_0255_0FED6395CC9EF118">
which is de&s;troying the good, and drinking in the blood of the ju&s;t. O truth, my country, friend&s;hip, &s;acred objects, &s;entiments dear to my heart, receive my la&s;t offering! My life was devoted to you, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e alone &s;pread a &s;oftne&s;s and grace over my la&s;t mo|ments! God of Heaven! enlighten this unhappy people, for who&s;e liberty I breathe my warme&s;t vows!&mdash;Liberty!&mdash;to tho&s;e great &s;ouls it eminently belongs who de&s;pi&s;e death, and who can meet it with courage: but it was not formed for weak minds, who compound with crime, while they conceal their &s;elf-love and their cowardice under the name of pru|dence. It was not formed for tho&s;e profligate men, who, ri&s;ing from their beds of debauchery, or creep|ing forth from a &s;ink of wretchedne&s;s, run and bathe them&s;elves in the blood that &s;treams from the &s;caf|folds. But it is the guardian of a wi&s;e and humane people who practi&s;e ju&s;tice, de&s;pi&s;e flatterers, know their true friends, and revere truth. As long as you &s;hall not form &s;uch a people, O my fellow-citizens! you will talk in vain of liberty; you will live only in a &s;tate of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, of which each of you will fall the victim in your turn; you will a&s;k for bread, but you will find only mangled carca&s;&s;es, and you will end in being &s;laves.</P>
<P>I have concealed neither my &s;entiments, nor opi|nions. I know that a Roman lady was &s;ent to ex|ecution under Tiberius, for having lamented her &s;on. I know that in times of blindne&s;s and party-&s;pirit, whoever dares to avow him&s;elf the friend of condemned or pro&s;cribed men, expo&s;es him&s;elf to &s;hare their fate; but I de&s;pi&s;e death. I have never feared any thing but guilt; and I would not pur|cha&s;e my life at the price of meanne&s;s.</P>
<P>Unhappy times, unhappy people, when the obli|gation of rendering ju&s;tice to injured virtue is be&s;et with danger; but too happy are tho&s;e who have

<P>AFTER the &s;iege of Peru&s;ia, &s;ay the hi&s;torians, in &s;pite of the capitulation, the an&s;wer of Augu&s;tus was; "You mu&s;t all peri&s;h." Three hundred of the principal citizens were dragged to the altar of Julius Cae&s;ar, and there on the day of the ides of March were murdered: after which the remainder of the inhabitants were put without di&s;tinction to the edge of the &s;word; and the city, which was one of the fine&s;t in Italy, was reduced to a&s;hes, and as much effaced as Herculaneum from the &s;urface of the earth.</P>
<P>There was formerly a law in Rome, &s;ays Taci|tus, which defined &s;tate crimes and high trea&s;ons, and which decreed the puni&s;hment of pain of death. The&s;e crimes of high trea&s;on, under the republic, were reduced to four &s;orts: namely, if an army had been abandoned in an enemy's country; if &s;edition had been excited; if the members of the con&s;tituted bodies had mi&s;managed public affairs, or mi&s;applied the public money; and if the maje&s;ty of the Roman people had been degraded. The emperors wanted but a few additional articles to this law to involve both the citizens and whole cities in a general pro|&s;cription. Augu&s;tus was the fir&s;t to extend this law of high trea&s;on, in which he comprehended writings which he called <HI>counter-revolutionary.</HI> Un|der his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the exten&s;ion of this law became unbounded. When &s;imple remarks were con&s;trued into &s;tate crimes, it required but a little &s;tretch of
<PB N="258" REF="031634_0257_0FED64378BDA4570">
power to change looks either of compa&s;&s;ion or &s;or|row, or even &s;ighs, and &s;ilence it&s;elf, into guilt.</P>
<P>It was a crime of high trea&s;on or <HI>counter-revolu|tion</HI> in the city of Nur&s;ia to have erected a monu|ment to its inhabitants who were killed at the &s;iege of Mutina, in fighting under Augu&s;tus him&s;elf: but it was, becau&s;e Augu&s;tus then fought with Brutus; and Nur&s;ia met with the fate of Peru&s;ia.</P>

Neither age nor innocence could &s;hield Quintus Gellius from the bloody hands of the executioner; and this &s;ame Augu&s;tus, who&s;e cle|mency has been &s;o much boa&s;ted, tore out his eyes with his own hands.

<P>In one word, under three reigns the natural death of a celebrated man was &s;o rare a thing, that it was put into the gazette as a &s;ort of epocha, and tran&s;|mitted
<PB N="262" REF="031634_0261_0FED63EC0441D030">
by hi&s;torians to the remembrance of ages, "Under this con&s;ulate," &s;ays our annali&s;t, "the pontiff Pi&s;o died in his bed, which appeared &s;ome|what miraculous."</P>
<P>The death of &s;o many excellent citizens appeared a le&s;s calamity than the in&s;olence and &s;candalous for|tunes of their murderers and denunciators. Every day the &s;acred and inviolable informer made his tri|umphant entry into the palaces of the dead, and &s;eized on &s;ome rich inheritance. All the&s;e denun|ciators a&s;&s;umed the mo&s;t re&s;pectable names, and cal|led them&s;elves Cotta, Scipio, Regulus, Ca&s;&s;ius, Severus. Denunciation was the only means of ar|riving at honours, and Regulus was made con&s;ul three times on account of his informations.</P>
<P>In this manner every one threw him&s;elf in the way of arriving at dignities, &s;ince the road was &s;o ea&s;y; and the <HI>marquis</HI> Serenus, in order to make his fir&s;t appearance with <HI>&eacute;clat,</HI> and gain reputation as an informer, began a pro&s;ecution again&s;t his aged father as a <HI>counter-revolutioni&s;t;</HI> after which he deco|rated him&s;elf with the &s;ounding name of Brutus.</P>
<P>The judges re&s;embled the accu&s;ers: the tribunals, which ought to have been the protectors of life and property, were become butcheries; and robbery and murder bore the names of confi&s;cation and pu|ni&s;hment.</P>
<P>If there were no means of &s;ending a man to the tribunal, he was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated or impri&s;oned. Celer AElius, the famous Locu&s;ta, the phy&s;ician Anice|tus, were poi&s;oners by profe&s;&s;ion, privileged men, travelling in the &s;uite of the court, and a kind of lords of the bed-chamber to the crown. When the&s;e half-mea&s;ures were not found &s;ufficient, the tyrant had recour&s;e to a general pro&s;cription. Thus it was that Caracalla declared all his friends and the parti&s;ans of Sejanus enemies of the republic, to the

number of thirty thou&s;and. Thus it was that Sylla in one day forbade the u&s;e of fire and water to &s;e|venty thou&s;and Romans. If a lion-emperor had a praetorian guard of tigers and panthers, they would not have torn in pieces a greater number than the common informers, the freedmen, the poi&s;oners, and the cut-throats of the Cae&s;ars; for the cruelty cau&s;ed by hunger cea&s;es with hunger, while that cau&s;ed by fear, by the avarice and the &s;u&s;picions of tyrants has no bounds. To what a degree of de|gradation and ba&s;ene&s;s mu&s;t not the human race have fallen, when we think that Rome &s;uffered the go|vernment of a mon&s;ter, who complained that his reign had not been &s;ignalized by any calamity, pe&s;|tilence, famine or earthquake; who envied Au|gu&s;tus the happine&s;s of having had under his empire an army cut to pieces, and in the reign of Tiberius the di&s;a&s;ter of the amphitheatre of Fid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nae, where fifty thou&s;and per&s;ons peri&s;hed; and to &s;um up all in one word, who wi&s;hed that the Roman people had but one neck, to put it <HI>in ma&s;s</HI> through<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cant word for the guillotine.</NOTE> "the little window!"</P>

<P>"THE &s;ituation of affairs, and the di&s;contented &s;tate of the public mind, alarmed the court. The mini&s;ters &s;oon became the object of general ani|madver&s;ion, and their conduct did not appear at all favourable to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the con&s;titution, which the king had &s;worn to maintain contrary to his will and feelings, and which he was determined not to &s;upport. Amid&s;t the frequent changes and confu&s;ion which then took place in admini&s;tration, the court was puzzled and doubtful of whom to make choice. It was &s;aid openly and loudly, that, if the king was &s;incere, he would choo&s;e his mini&s;|ters among&s;t men who&s;e reputation for patrioti&s;m was not doubtful. The king had hitherto decided
<PB N="266" REF="031634_0265_0FED63F082E64770">
as cowardice or fear dictated; &s;ometimes with the hopes of gaining over tho&s;e who were named, or with the re&s;olution, if this plan did not &s;ucceed, of driving them altogether from the court. At length the king &s;eemed determined to choo&s;e his mini&s;ters among&s;t tho&s;e who were called patriots, for then the appellation was not di&s;honoured. How that came to pa&s;s I never have been informed. Intelligent men reflected how important it was to direct the choice of the court towards men of talents and of re&s;pecta|ble character; for it was po&s;&s;ible that it might have taken a malignant plea&s;ure in making a &s;election of a &s;et of wrong-headed Jacobins, who&s;e blunders and exaggerations would have ju&s;tified complaints, and brought di&s;grace on the whole body of patriots. I do not know who it was that in the committee of the Place Vend&ocirc;me named Roland as one of tho&s;e who ought to be cho&s;en; but his name was connected with the idea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The committee of Place Vendome was an a&s;&s;embly of patriot deputies, who met at the hou&s;e of one of their colleagues for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of public affairs.</NOTE> of a man well informed, who had written on &s;everal branches of admini&s;tration, who had experience in the&s;e affairs, who be&s;ides po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable degree of reputation, and who&s;e prin|ciples unequivocally expre&s;&s;ed in his writings, even before the revolution, di&s;covered him to be a warm parti&s;an of liberty, being &s;o in all re&s;pects. The king was not a &s;tranger to the&s;e con&s;iderations, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to prove.</P>
<P>This project was communicated to us only three days before the new mini&s;try was formed. Bri&s;&s;ot came to me one evening when I was alone, and told me that Roland was thought of as mini&s;ter. I &s;miled, and a&s;ked him what he meant by his plea|&s;antry? He an&s;wered me, that he was in earne&s;t, informed me of what I have ju&s;t related, and added,
<PB N="267" REF="031634_0266_0FED643B86E94D68">
that he was come to know if Roland would under|take the charge. I promi&s;ed to &s;peak to Roland on the &s;ubject, and give him an an&s;wer the next day. Roland was as much a&s;toni&s;hed as my&s;elf at the event. A multiplicity of affairs to one of his ac|tive mind was no cau&s;e of objection; and he told me, that as he had always ob&s;erved placemen to be beings of a very middling rank with re&s;pect to ta|lents, and yet public bu&s;ine&s;s went forward, he was not him&s;elf afraid of the undertaking; that the &s;itua|tion was indeed critical, on account of the di&s;tinct intere&s;t of the court and the uncertainty of the king's intentions; but that whoever attended only to his duty, and was carele&s;s about the lo&s;s of his place in executing it, had nothing to fear: be&s;ides which, a zealous man, who was con&s;cientious in the means he made u&s;e of, could not be without hope of be|ing of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to his country. Roland therefore determined to accept the office, and made known his intentions to Bri&s;&s;ot, who came the next evening at eleven o'clock at the breaking up of the council, accompanied by Dumourier, who an|nounced to him officially that the king had ju&s;t made choice of him as mini&s;ter for home-affairs. Dumou|rier, who had been mini&s;ter for &s;ome little time, &s;poke of the king's &s;incere di&s;po&s;itions to &s;upport the con|&s;titution, and his hopes of &s;eeing the machine go on with &s;ucce&s;s, when the whole of the council &s;hould be animated by the &s;ame &s;pirit: he te&s;tified al&s;o to Roland his particular &s;atisfaction in &s;eeing &s;o vir|tuous and enlightened a patriot named to the ad|mini&s;tration of government.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;ot ob&s;erved that the department for home-affairs was the mo&s;t delicate and the mo&s;t intricate of all, and that it was a con&s;olation to the friends of liberty to &s;ee it entru&s;ted to pure and firm hands. The conver&s;ation turned &s;lightly on the&s;e heads,
<PB N="268" REF="031634_0267_0FED640DE7A6A280">
and the hour was fixed on for Roland the next day to be pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty, to take the oath, and his &s;eat at the council.</P>
<P>I found in Dumourier the manly air of a &s;oldier, the addre&s;s of an able courtier, the &s;tyle of a man of wit, but no trace of truth. In comparing this man with his new colleague, who&s;e au&s;terity and frankne&s;s &s;ometimes border on rudene&s;s, I a&s;ked my&s;elf if they were made to go on long together? "Here is a man," &s;aid Roland, after their depar|ture, "who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es talents." "Yes," replied I, "and again&s;t which you mu&s;t be on your guard; for I think him capable of ca&s;ting you all off, if you do not keep to his pace: we &s;hall &s;ee." The fir&s;t time Roland appeared at court in his ordinary &s;imple dre&s;s, which he had for a long time worn for the &s;ake of convenience, a few &s;cattered hairs, combed over his venerable head, a round hat, and his &s;hoes tied with &s;trings, tho&s;e valets of the court who placed the highe&s;t importance in the etiquette on which their own exi&s;tence depends, looked at him with di&s;dain, and with &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hment. One of them approached Dumourier, and, knitting his brows, whi&s;pered him, while he pointed out with his eyes the object of his &s;urpri&s;e, "Sir! &s;ir! ..... no buckles in his &s;hoes!" Dumourier, putting on an air of affected gravity, exclaimed, "Ay, &s;ir, it is all over, we are all ruined." The &s;tory went round, and tho&s;e laughed at it who had the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to be diverted.</P>
<P>Lewis XVI. behaved to his mini&s;try with the greate&s;t good-humour. This man was not preci&s;e|ly &s;uch a per&s;onage as he has been indu&s;triou&s;ly re|pre&s;ented by tho&s;e who were intere&s;ted in degrad|ing him. He was neither that &s;tupid &s;ot which he has been held out to be for the purpo&s;e of excit|ing contempt, nor that polite, good and affectionate
<PB N="269" REF="031634_0268_0FED63DD91BDA040">
character for which his friends have extolled him. Nature had formed him in a common kind of mould: he would have acted well in an ob&s;cure &s;i|tuation; but he was depraved by a royal educa|tion, and lo&s;t his moderation at a critical period, in which his &s;afety could have been effected only by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of genius or virtue. A common mind, educated at court, and taught from the cra|dle the art of di&s;&s;embling, acquires many advan|tages in its commerce with mankind. The art of di&s;covering to each no more than he would wi&s;h him to know, is only a habit, to which con&s;tant exerci&s;e gives the appearance of addre&s;s; and a man mu&s;t be born an ideot, in order to appear a fool in a &s;imilar &s;ituation. Lewis XVI. had be|&s;ides a good memory, and a great &s;hare of activi|ty; he never was a moment unemployed, and read a good deal. He had the mo&s;t perfect and minute knowledge of all the treaties made by France with the neighbouring powers; he was well acquainted with its hi&s;tory, and was the be&s;t geographer in his kingdom. Knowledge of names; the ju&s;t ap|plication of them to the phy&s;iogomies of the per|&s;ons of the court to whom they belonged; acquain|tance with all their private anecdotes, had been ex|tended by him to every individual, who had at all di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the revolution; and no one of any quality or de&s;cription could be mentioned to him, of whom he could not give &s;ome kind of in|formation founded on their private hi&s;tory. But Lewis XVI. without &s;trength of character, was confined in his views, and had twi&s;ted as it were his feelings by &s;uper&s;titious prejudices and je&s;uitical principles. The great ideas of religion, the belief of a God, and the a&s;&s;urance of immortality, are perfectly in harmony with philo&s;ophy; and while theyr ear its column on tho&s;e mo&s;t &s;olid of all foun|dations,

they likewi&s;e adorn it with the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> capital. Wretched are the legi&s;lators who de&s;|pi&s;e the&s;e powerful means of in&s;piring political vir|tues, and of forming the morals of a nation. If they were even illu&s;ions, we ought to cheri&s;h them, for the con&s;olation of mankind: but the religion of our prie&s;ts pre&s;ented us only with objects of child|i&s;h fear, and mi&s;erable mummeries, in&s;tead of good works; and al&s;o con&s;ecrated the whole code of de&s;poti&s;m, on which the authority of the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed church is founded. Lewis XVI. was literally afraid of hell, the horns and hoofs of the devil, and excommunication, and with all this it was im|po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be any thing but a poor creature of a king. If he had been born two hundred years earlier, and had had a rea&s;onable wife, he would have made no more noi&s;e in the world than other princes of his line, who have pa&s;&s;ed acro&s;s the &s;tage without doing either much good or evil: but a&s;cend|ing the throne amid&s;t the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of the court of Lewis XV. and the di&s;ordered &s;tate of the trea|&s;ury, and &s;urrounded by corrupted men, he was drawn on by a giddy woman, who joined to Au&s;trian in&s;olence the forwardne&s;s of youth, and to the ar|rogance of grandeur the intoxication of the &s;en|&s;es, and the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of levity; and who was her&s;elf &s;educed by all the vices of an A&s;iatic court. Lewis XVI. too weak to hold the reins of govern|ment, which was now falling headlong into ruin, and crumbling to de&s;olation, ha&s;tened his own by faults without number. Neckar, who always act|ed the pathetic in politics as well as in writing; a man of moderate abilities, but of which the world entertained a high opinion, becau&s;e he had formed a high opinion of them him&s;elf, which he was care|ful to make known; without fore&s;ight; a &s;ort of a retail financier, who could only calculate the con|tents
<PB N="271" REF="031634_0270_0FED635D06417C78">
of a pur&s;e, and was talking continually of his reputation, as women of intrigue talk of their cha&s;tity; Neckar was but a &s;orry pilot for the &s;torm that was gathering. France was, as it were, ex|hau&s;ted of men: it is a thing highly &s;urpri&s;ing that they &s;hould have been &s;o &s;carce in this revolution: it has brought forth &s;carcely any but pigmies. It is not becau&s;e there was any want of wit, of in|formation, of knowledge, of philo&s;ophy: the&s;e in|gredients had never been more common: it was the blaze of the torch ju&s;t expiring. But that energy of &s;oul which J. J. Rou&s;&s;eau has &s;o admi|rably defined as the fir&s;t characteri&s;tic of the hero, &s;upported by that &s;olidity of judgment which knows the ju&s;t value of every thing; with that fore&s;ight which penetrates into futurity, the re-union of which con&s;titutes character, and forms the &s;uperior man; we have looked for it every where, but it has been no where to be found.</P>
<P>Lewis XVI. continually floating between the fear of irritating his &s;ubjects, and his wi&s;h to keep them within bounds, and unable to govern them, convened the &s;tates-general, in&s;tead of reforming the expences, and regulating his court. After hav|ing him&s;elf unveiled the &s;pring, and &s;hewed the way to innovation, he hoped to &s;top its progre&s;s, by af|fecting a power again&s;t which he had furni&s;hed arms, and again&s;t which he had him&s;elf given in|&s;tructions for re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>No other means were left him, than to &s;acrifice with a good grace a part of his authority, in order, by means of the other, to &s;eize the whole, on a proper occa&s;ion, which he was not however likely to do; &s;ince he gave him&s;elf up to the mo&s;t de&s;|perate &s;ort of intrigues, the only &s;ort familiar to tho&s;e whom he cho&s;e for his advi&s;ers, under the protection and patronage of his wife. He
<PB N="272" REF="031634_0271_0FED6431E2FA5498">
had certainly pre&s;erved under the con&s;titution &s;uf|ficient means both of power and of happine&s;s, if he had had the wi&s;dom to keep him&s;elf within bounds. Want of ability had di&s;abled him from preventing the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the new govern|ment; but hone&s;ty alone would have been &s;uffici|ent to have &s;aved him, if he had been &s;incere in exe|cuting, when he had accepted the con&s;titution. Un|happily for him&s;elf, on one hand to &s;upport what he was overthrowing with the other, was his crooked po|licy; and this perfidious conduct fir&s;t excited mi&s;tru&s;t, and then fini&s;hed by kindling general indignation.</P>
<P>When he had made choice of patriotic mini&s;ters, he was particularly anxious to in&s;pire them with confidence; and he &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that for three weeks, I &s;aw Roland and Clavieres, enchanted with the king's di&s;po&s;itions, thinking only of the happy order of things, and flattering them&s;elves that the revolution was fini&s;hed.&mdash;"Good God!" I &s;aid to them, "every time I &s;ee you come from the council with this great confidence, I always think that you are about to commit &s;ome act of great folly." "I a&s;&s;ure you," an&s;wered Clavieres, "that the king is perfectly convinced that his inte|re&s;t is intimately connected with the ob&s;ervance of the laws which have been ju&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed: he rea&s;ons about them too feelingly not to have a per|fect conviction of this truth." "If," added Ro|land, "he be not an hone&s;t man, he is the mo&s;t arrant cheat in the kingdom: di&s;&s;imulation can hardly go &s;o far." "And for my part," I replied, "I have no great confidence in any man's regard for the con&s;titution, who has been educated in the prejudices of de&s;poti&s;m and habits of di&s;&s;ipation, and who&s;e conduct latterly has exhibited a total want both of genius and virtue. Lewis XVI. mu&s;t be a man very much above the common &s;tandard, to have any
<PB N="273" REF="031634_0272_0FED641C9CD5D9E8">
&s;incere regard for a con&s;titution which narrows the limits of his power; and if he had been &s;uch a man, he would not have &s;uffered tho&s;e events to have taken place which have brought about this con&s;titu|tion." My great argument for his in&s;incerity was founded on his flight to Varennes.</P>
<P>There was a council four times a week. The mini&s;ters agreed to dine together at each other's hou&s;es by turns every council day. I received them on Fridays. De Grave was the mini&s;ter of war. He was a &s;light man in all re&s;pects; nature had made him mild and timid; his prejudices would have made him haughty, but his heart forced him to be gentle; and from his embarra&s;&s;ment to re|concile the&s;e different parts of his character, he be|came in reality nothing. I think I &s;ee him march|ing with his courtier-like air, his head quite aloft from his feeble frame, &s;hewing the white of his blue eyes, which he could &s;carcely keep open after dinner, without the help of two or three cups of coffee; &s;peaking but little, as if he had been re|&s;erved, but which &s;ilence proceeded only from pe|nury of ideas: in fine, he was &s;o bewildered amid&s;t the bu&s;ine&s;s of his department, that he a&s;ked leave to retire. Laco&s;te was a true clerk of office un|der the old &s;y&s;tem, with an in&s;ignificant mien, a cold look, and a dramatical tone, with talents for the ordinary run of affairs: but his formal phy|&s;iognomy concealed a violence of character which, in di&s;cu&s;&s;ions where he met with contradiction, made him ridiculous: he had no comprehen&s;ive views, nor the activity nece&s;&s;ary for a mini&s;ter. Duranthon, who had been brought up from Bour|deaux to be mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, was hone&s;t, as they &s;ay, but very indolent: he had an air of va|nity, and always appeared to me an old woman, from his timorous character and his con&s;equential

babble. Clavieres was appointed mini&s;ter of fi|nance, from the reputation he had gained for his knowledge in that branch, but of which I am no judge. He was laborious and active, ira&s;cible and ob&s;tinate, as tho&s;e men generally are who live con|fined to their de&s;ks; punctilious and difficult in his di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and often in contradiction with Roland: the&s;e two men e&s;teemed without ever loving each other, but never di&s;agreed in the great leading prin|ciples of their duties.</P>
<P>Dumourier had a greater &s;hare than any of the&s;e in what is called wit, and le&s;s of morality. Dili|gent and brave, a good general, a thorough-paced courtier, a good writer, a ready &s;peaker, and ca|pable of great undertakings; he was deficient only in firmne&s;s of character, and wanted a cooler head to execute the plans he had conceived: good hu|moured with his friends, and ready to cheat every one of them; a&s;&s;iduous to the ladies, but no way fitted to &s;ucceed with tho&s;e who were to be won only by tenderne&s;s; he was altogether formed for the mini&s;terial intrigues of a corrupted court. His &s;plendid qualities, and his love of glory, led us to think that he might be u&s;efully employed in the armies of the republic; and perhaps he would have acted well if the convention had acted wi&s;ely; for he had too much good &s;en&s;e not to behave as an ho|ne&s;t man, when his reputation and his intere&s;t were &s;o intimately concerned.</P>
<P>At this time De Grave was about to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The mini&s;ters and the patriot deputies were at a lo&s;s on whom to fix for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, &s;ince the mi|litary men who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves were almo&s;t all of them ho&s;tile to the con&s;titution. Ro|land thought of Servan, who had been long in the &s;ervice, and had obtained the cro&s;s of St. Lewis; and who&s;e principles were not equivocal, &s;ince
<PB N="273" REF="031634_0274_0FED63E2139179C8">
he had publi&s;hed them previou&s;ly to the revolution in an excellent work called "The &s;oldier a citi|zen." We knew him per&s;onally from having &s;een him at Lyons, where he had the de&s;erved reputa|tion of a wi&s;e and indu&s;trious man; and where he retired after having lo&s;t his place at court as gover|nor of the pages, his politics not being &s;uitable either to tho&s;e of M. St. Prie&s;t, or the palace.</P>
<P>Servan is an upright man in the full extent of the term, of an ardent mind, pure morals, with all the au&s;terity of a philo&s;opher, and all the goodne&s;s of an affectionate heart; an enlightened patriot, a brave &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ldier, a vigilant mini&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">: he wanted only perhaps a little more coolne&s;s of temper, and more energy of character; but he had a degree of merit rare to find, and we &s;hould have been too happy to have had many men of this &s;tamp.</P>
<P>The &s;ittings of the council might be called de|cent in compari&s;on with what they became after|wards; but they were at that time puerile, con&s;i|dering the great intere&s;ts which were at &s;take. Each of the mini&s;ters who had <HI>bons</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bons</HI> are orders for certain operations, mo&s;t commonly for the delivery of money.</NOTE> to &s;ign, or other papers belonging to his office, went to the king on the council day to arrange this particular bu&s;ine&s;s before the council began. They all went afterwards into the council hall; where, after the decrees had been &s;igned, which the mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice pre&s;ented, debates took place re&s;pecting the operations of government, internal order, relations with foreign powers, peace or war, &amp;c. With re&s;pect to the proclamations of the day, they had only to examine the decree and apply it, which was always a &s;hort bu&s;ine&s;s. The king &s;uffered his mini&s;ters to talk: in the mean time he read the
<PB N="276" REF="031634_0275_0FED639AE0F0E450">
gazette, the Engli&s;h news-papers in their own language, or wrote letters. The &s;anction of the decrees, however, fixed his attention: he did not give his &s;anction readily, but never refu&s;ed. When a decree was pre&s;ented for the fir&s;t time, he put off &s;anctioning it till the following council, when he came with his mind made up.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to objects of great political con|cern, he often eluded examining them, by turning the conver&s;ation on different &s;ubjects, or on mat|ters peculiar to each of the mini&s;ters. If the bu|&s;ine&s;s turned on war affairs, he talked about tra|vels; if it was a diplomatic di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, he began a hi&s;tory of the manners of the country in que&s;tion, or made enquiries about its &s;ituation and produce; if the examination of the &s;tate affairs led him into details of agriculture and rural oeconomy, he que&s;|tioned Roland about his works, talked to Dumou|rier about his anecdotes, and &s;o with the re&s;t. The council in &s;hort was little el&s;e than a coffee-hou&s;e, where every one learnt the news of the day, and amu&s;ed him&s;elf with trifles: there was no regi&s;ter kept of the deliberations, no &s;ecretary to minute them. After three or four hours conver&s;ation the council broke up, without having done any thing, except putting &s;ome &s;ignatures, and this took place three times a week. "But this is pitiful!" I could not help exclaiming with &s;ome ill humour when, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Roland's return, I a&s;ked him what had pa&s;&s;ed. "You are all of you too courteous, be|cau&s;e you meet with no oppo&s;ition, becau&s;e you are treated with affability and politene&s;s, becau&s;e you have the appearance of doing each of you in your re&s;pective departments ju&s;t what you plea&s;e. I am much afraid that you will all be de|ceived."</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="031634_0276_0FED644008FF5458">
"But neverthele&s;s," &s;ays Roland, "bu&s;ine&s;s goes on."&mdash;"Yes, but time is lo&s;t; for in the torrent of affairs that is overwhelming you, I would rather &s;ee you employ three hours in &s;oli|tary meditation on tho&s;e great combinations of events before you, than wa&s;te them in u&s;ele&s;s talk."</P>
<P>The enemy were now forming their plans, and it became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to declare war; a mea&s;ure which brought on warm di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and which the king a&s;&s;ented to with extreme repug|nance: he had delayed the deci&s;ion as long as po&s;&s;i|ble, and appeared to yield only when he &s;aw that the majority of the a&s;&s;embly were of that opinion, and that his council was unanimous.</P>
<P>The continuance and multiplicity of religious troubles re&s;pecting which the mini&s;ter for home-affairs had continually but in vain &s;olicited him for &s;ome time pa&s;t to take &s;trong and repre&s;&s;ive mea|&s;ures, now compelled him to do &s;o. On the other hand, the bold &s;teps taken by the foreign troops being formidable and menacing, had given the mi|ni&s;ter of war, Servan, an idea of a military project, which the a&s;&s;embly &s;eized on with enthu&s;ia&s;m, and in&s;tantly decreed.</P>
<P>It is very true that the&s;e two decrees, one for forming a camp of twenty thou&s;and me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> between Paris and the frontiers, and the other re&s;pecting the prie&s;ts, were altogether deci&s;ive. The court beheld in the&s;e mea&s;ures the overthrow of its &s;ecret machinations, of all its plans of partial in&s;urrec|tions, by the means of &s;anatici&s;m, and the progre&s;s of the enemy towards Paris; both of which opera|tions it protected.</P>
<P>The king was too much decided in refu&s;ing his &s;anction to be very earne&s;t in declaring his deter|mination. He made u&s;e of different pretences, by
<PB N="278" REF="031634_0277_0FED3264085B5010">
which means he avoided an explanation for fifteen days. A debate was begun &s;everal times on the&s;e two articles. Roland and Servan in&s;i&s;ted with warmth, and with great energy declared the mo&s;t &s;triking truths, becau&s;e each felt the importance and the nece&s;&s;ity of the law as it re&s;pected his par|ticular province. The general intere&s;t of the af|fair was a thing evident to all of them, and the &s;ix mini&s;ters had but one opinion on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>During the&s;e di&s;putes, Dumourier, who was in|timate with the king, and who&s;e morals were more in uni&s;on with tho&s;e of the court, was often a vi&s;i|tor of the queen; and as he was not in great har|mony with his colleagues, the au&s;terity of who&s;e manners was a reproach to his own, he found &s;oon the means of getting rid of them, and entered into arrangements the effects of which were not long in being felt. A mi&s;under&s;tanding, or rather a &s;e|rious di&s;pute, had taken place between Dumourier and his colleagues, particularly Roland, re&s;pecting Baron Carrieve, whom Dumourier had made direc|tor-general of the foreign department. A report was &s;pread that the &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and livres was paid to Madame de Beauvert, who lived with Dumourier as his mi&s;tre&s;s, and did the ho|nours of his table, to the great &s;candal of tho&s;e who were connected with him. Dumourier re|ceived the repre&s;entations that were made to him by Roland, both with re&s;pect to his neglect of de|cency, and his attachment to this director-general, with ill-humour: he quitted the meeting of the pa|triotic deputies, and became vi&s;ibly cool towards Roland. "From this moment," continues Ma|dame Roland, "he cea&s;ed holding any farther com|munication with the deputies, and became more re&s;erved towards his colleagues; and no doubt be|gan to meditate how he might mo&s;t expeditiou&s;ly
<PB N="279" REF="031634_0278_0FED6434B56A4D18">
rid him&s;elf of tho&s;e who&s;e characters were lea&s;t in uni&s;on with his own. I fore&s;aw the effect of the&s;e conferences, and &s;aid to Roland; "If you were an intriguer, capable of behaving according to the er|rors of the old court and its former &s;y&s;tem, I &s;hould &s;ay that the moment is come when you ought to get rid of Dumourier, to hinder him from play|ing you &s;ome trick." But hone&s;t men under&s;tand nothing of the&s;e &s;ort of courtier-like &s;kirmi&s;hes, and Roland was as incapable of having recour&s;e to them as he was unfitted to practi&s;e them.</P>
<P>The delay of the &s;anction was now under&s;tood as a po&s;itive veto, as the time was almo&s;t expired. We felt that the council not having courage and con&s;i&s;tence enough to pronounce their opinions <HI>in ma&s;s,</HI> it was Roland's duty, and what integrity and courage directed him, to &s;tep forward &s;ingly; and we determined together on writing the well-known letter to the king. I compo&s;ed this letter my&s;elf, which was written without much meditation. He carried it to the council to read it aloud on the day when the king, who was &s;till urged re&s;pecting his &s;anction, required the mini&s;ters to give each of them his opinion written and &s;igned, and then went rapidly on to talk of other affairs. Roland re|turned home, added a few lines in the cover of the letter, and had it put into the king's hands on the morning of the 11th of June. The next day, the 12th, about eight o'clock, Servan called on us with a gay countenance. "Give me joy," &s;aid he, "I have had the honour to be turned out." "My hu&s;band," I replied, "will &s;oon &s;hare the &s;ame fate, and I am &s;omewhat picqued that you are the fir&s;t." He told us, that having gone that morning to the king for &s;ome private bu&s;ine&s;s, he had talked with him very warmly on the nece&s;&s;ity of the camp of twenty thou&s;and men, if he was really in earne&s;t
<PB N="280" REF="031634_0279_0FED63E62C8172A8">
in oppo&s;ing the de&s;igns of the enemy; that the king had turned his back to him in very ill humour; and that Dumourier had ju&s;t left the war-office, where he had gone to take the &s;eals in con&s;equence of an order which he carried with him. "Du|mourier! he plays a &s;orry part&mdash;but it does not &s;urpri&s;e me." The three preceding days he had often been at the Thuilleries in long conferences with the queen; and it is not ami&s;s to remark, that Baron Carri&eacute;ve had &s;ome intere&s;t through her wo|men. Roland hearing that Servan was with me, left the per&s;ons to whom he was giving audience, learned the news, and &s;ent to invite his colleagues, Dumourier excepted, to come to him.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed proper not to wait to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and as Servan's di&s;mi&s;&s;ion had taken place, tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ame principles ought to give in their own, at lea&s;t unle&s;s the king would recall Servan, and di&s;mi&s;s Dumourier, with whom they ought never again to &s;it in council. I do not doubt but that if the four mini&s;ters had behaved in this man|ner, the court would not have been a little embar|ra&s;&s;ed to replace them; that Laco&s;te and Duran|thon would have done them&s;elves credit, and that the bu&s;ine&s;s would have been &s;o much the more intere&s;ting for the public, as it became &s;o in a very different manner.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters debated without coming to any conclu&s;ion, except that they would meet again the next day at eight o'clock in the morning, and that Roland &s;hould prepare a letter for them. I could never have believed, if circum&s;tances had not put me in the way of knowing it, that judgment and firmne&s;s of character were &s;o rare: how few men are there, con&s;equently, fitted for bu&s;ine&s;s, and how much fewer &s;till are formed to govern! Were we to wi&s;h for the union of the&s;e qualities with
<PB N="281" REF="031634_0280_0FED6385F481E500">
perfect di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, we wi&s;h for a Phoenix, almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to find. I am not a&s;toni&s;hed that men above the common &s;tandard, and who are placed at the head of empires, &s;hould hold mo&s;t commonly the human race in contempt. It is the almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of great knowledge of the world, and in order to avoid the errors into which tho&s;e may fall who are entru&s;ted with the happine&s;s of nations, there mu&s;t be a fund of phi|lo&s;ophy and of magnanimity not very common.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters kept their appointment, but con|cluded that it would be better to &s;peak to the king in per&s;on than to write to him; a mea&s;ure which appeared rather as an expedient to avoid lo&s;ing their places than to come to an explanation. While they were yet deliberating, the king &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Duranthon, the mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, to go imme|diately and alone. The mini&s;ters Roland and Cla|vieres went to wait for him at his hotel. Duran|thon returned with a lengthened face and hypocri|tical air, and drew out &s;lowly from his pocket a paper containing the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of his two col|leagues. "You have made us wait a long time for our liberty," &s;aid Roland to him, &s;miling, and taking the paper: he returned and acquainted me with the news, which I had well fore&s;een. I con|gratulated him on it, and advi&s;ed him not to wait till the king announced it to the a&s;&s;embly, but to do it him&s;elf; and, &s;ince his maje&s;ty had taken no advantage of the in&s;tructions contained in the letter, to make them u&s;eful to the public by pub|li&s;hing them him&s;elf. I &s;aw nothing more con|&s;i&s;tent with the courage of having written to him, than firmne&s;s in &s;ending a copy of it to the a&s;&s;embly: in hearing of your di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, the a&s;&s;embly will become acquainted with the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="031634_0281_0FED644543EFDFA0">
This idea proved agreeable to my hu&s;band, and every one knows the honours which the a&s;|&s;embly conferred on the three mini&s;ters Servan, Roland, and Clavieres; by declaring that their di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion was accompanied by the regrets of the na|tion; as well as the applau&s;e be&s;towed on the letter, which was ordered to be printed and &s;ent into the departments."</P>
<P>This citation from madame Roland's memoirs will not perhaps be thought too long, &s;ince it con|tains the detail of tho&s;e circum&s;tances which pre|cipitated Lewis XVI. from the throne, and de|&s;troyed monarchy in France. It is probable that at &s;ome future period this fabric would have fallen amid&s;t the &s;torms of popular di&s;cu&s;&s;ions: but its di&s;&s;olution, had the conduct of the court been different, would have been at lea&s;t more gentle. I have already mentioned that madame Roland &s;ent me from her pri&s;on certain papers, with a view no doubt, that I &s;hould in &s;ome happier days vindicate her memory to the world; and I have till this period, when I find that many of her papers have been pre&s;erved, felt the keene&s;t regret, that I was compelled by the late &s;anguinary &s;y&s;tem to de&s;troy tho&s;e in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without taking a copy, &s;ince to have had them di&s;covered was certain death.</P>
<P>Of the account of the conduct of the court written by madame Roland, general Servan, the only principal actor who &s;till remains, has given me many illu&s;trations. Servan, as mini&s;ter of war, had to contend not only with the enemies on the frontiers, but with tho&s;e much more for|midable to the &s;tate, in the Thuilleries. His office compelled him to hold longer communications with the king than the other mini&s;ters&mdash;if that could be called &s;o which was only a continued al|tercation.
<PB N="283" REF="031634_0282_0FED63B4F54DFF00">
&mdash;His duty prompted him to explain to him that his conduct was precipitating him&s;elf as well as the kingdom to ruin, and that the whole tenor of it di&s;covered him to be ho&s;tile to the con&s;titution, as well as to the intere&s;t of the &s;tate. "The king &s;eemed at times &s;o thoroughly con|vinced," &s;ays Servan, "That I deceived my&s;elf into a belief that the next meeting he would a&s;&s;ent to the propo&s;itions offered him: but in the interval he had been a&s;&s;ailed and hardened into re&s;i&s;tance in favour of Au&s;tria, by the queen&mdash;in favour of the prie&s;ts, by madame Eli&s;abeth; &s;o that it required going the &s;ame round of argument to bring him again to conviction. The king &s;ometimes ap|pealed to Servan, as knowing, from having been long at court, the rectitude of his intentions; to which Servan never would a&s;&s;ent: on the con|trary, he told him that his weakne&s;s, which was criminal, would never be any &s;hield again&s;t the indignation of the people, who would not enter into di&s;tinctions. Sometimes Servan finding no good was to be done that day, &s;at down to write till the hour when the council broke up, which di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the king exceedingly; who frequently interrupted him, by a&s;king if he was taking notes of their conver&s;ation. No &s;ecretary was allowed, though decreed by the con&s;titution, and repeatedly in&s;i&s;ted on by Roland and Servan; the former of whom brought his great morocco covered book, under his arm, to the great diver&s;ion of Servan, in order to enter the records: but the king per&s;i&s;ted in his refu&s;al, and the pages remained from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t un&s;ullied.</P>
