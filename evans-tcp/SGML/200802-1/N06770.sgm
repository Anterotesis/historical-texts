<P>THE Things that we have the Hi&s;tory of in this Book of <HI>Ruth,</HI> &s;eem to be in&s;erted into the cannon of the Scripture e&s;pecially on two Accounts.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e Chri&s;t was of Ruth's Po&s;terity. The Holy Gho&s;t thought fit to take particular Notice of that Marriage of Boaz with Ruth, whence &s;prang the Savior of the World. &mdash; We may often ob&s;erve it, that the Holy Spirit that indited the Scriptures often takes Notice of little Things, minute Occurrences, that do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t remotely relate to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e this Hi&s;tory &s;eems to be typical of the Call|ing of the Gentile Church, and indeed of the Conver&s;ion of eve|ry Believer. Ruth was not originally of I&s;rael, but was a Moab|ite&s;s&punc; and Alien from the Common-wealth of I&s;rael: But &s;he for&s;ook her own People, and the Idols of the Gentiles, to wor|&s;hip the God of I&s;rael, and to join her&s;elf to that People: Here|in &s;he &s;eems to be a Type of the Gentile Church, and al&s;o of e|very &s;incere convert. Ruth was the Mother of Chri&s;t; he c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me of her Po&s;terity: &s;o the Church is Chri&s;t's Mother, as &s;he is re|pre&s;ented <HI>Rev.</HI> 12. at the Beginning. And &s;o al&s;o is every true Chri&s;tian his Mother. Matth. 12.50. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> do the Will of my Father which is in Heaven, the &s;ame is my Brother, Si&s;|ter and Mother.</HI> Chri&s;t is what the Soul of every one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|lect is in Travail with, in the new Birth. Ruth for&s;ook all her natural Relations, and her own Country, the Land of her Nati|vity,
<PB N="3" REF="008589_0003_102F8A9A8A1BF788">
and all her former Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions there, for the &s;ake of the God of I&s;rael; as every true Chri&s;tian for&s;akes all for Chri&s;t P&s;alm 45.10. <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> O Daughter, and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">er&punc; and incline thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ear; forget al&s;o there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> People, and thy Father's Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Naomi was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow returning act of the Land of Moab, into the Land of I&s;rael, with her two Daughters in-law, Orpha and Ruth, who well repre&s;ent to us two Sorts of Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion; Or|pha that Sort that indeed make a fair Profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;eem to &s;et out well, but d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e but for a while, and then turn back; Ruth that Sort that are &s;ound and &s;incere, and therefore are &s;teadfa&s;t and per&s;evering in the Way that they have &s;et out in.

<P N="1">1.

When Naomi fir&s;t aro&s;e to return from the Coun|try of Moab into the Land of I&s;rael, Orpha and Ruth both &s;et out with her; and Naomi exherts them both to return: And they both of them wept, and &s;eem'd as if they could not bear the Thoughts of leaving her, and appeared as if they were re|&s;olv'd to go with her. Ver&s;e 10. <HI>And they &s;ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her, &s;urely we will return with that unto the People.</HI> Then Naomi &s;ays to them again, <HI>Turn again my Daughters, go your Way, &amp;c.</HI> And then they were greatly affected again, and Orpha returned and went back.

<P N="2">2.

<P>It is &s;ometimes &s;o&punc; that of tho&s;e that have been conver&s;ant one with another that have dwelt together as Neighbours, and have been often together as Companions, or have been united in near Relation, and have been together in Darkne&s;s, Bondage and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ti|lery, in the Service of Satan &s;ome are enlightened and have their Minds changed, are made to &s;ee the great End of Sin, and have their Hearts turned to God, and are influenced by the Holy Spi|rit of God to leave their Company that are on Satan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Side, to go it join them&s;elves with that ble&s;&s;ed Company that are with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">: they are made wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ake the Tents of Wickedne&s;s, to dwelt in the Land of Up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tne&s;s with the People of God.</P>

They are in a &s;afe State&punc; free from all Po&s;&s;ibility of peri&s;hing: Satan has no Power to de&s;troy them. God carries them&punc; on Ea|gle's Wings, far above Satan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Reach, and above the Reach of all the Enemies of their Souls.

Other Gods can't help in Calamity; nor can any of them afford what the poor empty Soul &s;tands in Need of. Let Men adore tho&s;e other Gods never &s;o much, and call upon them never &s;o earne&s;tly, and &s;erve them never &s;o diligently, they will neverthele&s;s remain poor, wretched, un&s;atisfied, undone Creatures. All other People are mi&s;erable, but that People who&s;e God is the Lord.&mdash;The World is divided into two Societies: There are the People of God, the little Flock of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that Company that we read of Rev. 14.4. <HI>The&s;e are they which were not defiled with Women; for they are Virgins: The&s;e are they which follow the Lomb whither|&s;oever he goeth: The&s;e were redeemed from among Men, being the fir&s;t Fruits unto God and to the Lamb.</HI> And there are tho&s;e that be|long to the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s; that are without Chri&s;t, be|ing Aliens from the Common-wealth of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Strangers from the Covenants of Promi&s;e, having no Hope, and without God in the World. All that are of this latter Company, are wretched and undone; they are the Enemies of God, and under his Wrath and Condemnation: They are the Devil's Slaves, that &s;erve him blindfold, and are befool'd and en&s;nared by him, and hurried along in the broad Way to eternal Perdition.</P>
<P N="4">IV. When tho&s;e that we have formerly been conver&s;ant with, are turning to God, and to his People, <HI>their Example</HI> ought to influence us. Their Example &s;hould be looked upon as the Call of God to us, to do as they have done. God, when he chan|ges the Heart of One, calls upon Another; e&s;pecially does he loudly call on tho&s;e that have been their Friends and Acquaint|ance.&mdash;We have been influenced by their Examples in Evil, and &s;hall we cea&s;e to follow them when they make the wi&s;e&s;t Choice that ever they made, and do the be&s;t Thing that ever he did?

Men are greatly influenced by &s;eeing one another's Pro&s;perity in other Things.

like them, when they obtain that &s;piritual and eternal Happine&s;s that is infinitely more worth than all the Pro&s;perity and Glory of this World.</P>
<P N="5">V. Our Re&s;olutions to cleave to and follow tho&s;e that are turn|ing to God, and joining them&s;elves to his People, ought to be fixed and &s;trong, becau&s;e of the great Difficulty of it. If we will cleave to them, and have their God for our God, and their People for our People we mu&s;t mortify and deny all our La&s;ts, and cro&s;s every evil Appetite and Inclination, and forever part with all Sin. But our Lu&s;ts are many and violent. Sin is natu|rally exceeding dear to us; to part with it is compared to pluck|ing out our right Eyes. Men may refrain from wonted Ways of Sin for a little While, and may deny their Lu&s;ts in a partial Degree, with le&s;s Difficulty; but 'tis heart rending Work final|ly to part with all Sin, and give our deare&s;t Lu&s;ts a Bill of Di|vorce, utterly to &s;end them away. But this we mu&s;t do if we would follow tho&s;e that are truly turning to God: Yea, we mu&s;t not only for&s;ake Sin, but mu&s;t, in a Sen&s;e, for&s;ake all the World, Luke 14.33 <HI>Who&s;oever he be of you, that for&s;aketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Di&s;ciple.</HI> That is, he mu&s;t for&s;ake all <HI>in his Heart</HI>&punc; and mu&s;t come to a thorough Di&s;po&s;ition and Rea|dine&s;s, <HI>actually</HI> to quit all for God, and the glorious &s;piritual Privileges of his People, whenever the Ca&s;e may require it; and that without any Pro&s;pect of any Thing of the like Nature, or a|ny worldly Thing whate&s;over to make Amends for it; and all to go into a &s;trange Country, a Land that has hitherto been un|&s;een; like Abraham, who being called of God, <HI>went out of his own Country, and from his Kindred, and from his Father's Hou&s;e, for a Land that God would &s;hew him, not knowing whither he went.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it was a hard Thing for Ruth to for&s;ake her native Coun|try, and her Father and Mother, her Kindred and Acquaintance, and all the plea&s;ant Things &s;he had in the Land of Moab, to dwell in the Land of I&s;rael, where &s;he had never been.&mdash; Naomi told her of the Difficulties once and again. They were too hard for her Si&s;ter Orpha; the Con&s;ideration of them turned her back after &s;he was &s;et out. Her Re&s;olution was not firm e|nough to overcome them. But &s;o firmly re&s;olved was Ruth that &s;he break through all; &s;he was &s;teadfa&s;t in it, that let the Diffi|culty be what it would, &s;he would not leave her Mother-in law. So Per&s;ons had need to be very firm in their Re&s;olution to con|quer the Difficulties that are in the Way of cleaving to them that are indeed turning from Sin to God.</P>

<P N="5">5. Con&s;ider what a doleful Company that will be that be left after this extraordinary Time of Mercy is over. We have Rea|&s;on to think that there will be a Number left. We read that when Ezekiel's healing Waters increa&s;ed &s;o abundently, and the healing Effect of them was &s;o very general; yet there were cer|tain Places where the Waters came, that never were healed. Eze. 47.9, 10.11. <HI>And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that every Thing that liveth, which moveth, whither&s;oever the Rivers come, &s;hall live. And there be a very great Maltitude of Fi&s;h, becau&s;e the&s;e Waters &s;hall come thither: for they &s;hall be healed, and every Thing &s;hall live, whither the River cometh. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that the Fi&s;hers &s;hall &s;tand upon it, from En-gedi, even unto En|eglaim; they &s;hall be a Place to &s;pread forth Nets: There Fi&s;h &s;hall be according to their Kinds, as the Fi&s;h of the Great Sea, exceeding many. But the miry Places thereof, and the Mar&s;hes thereof, &s;hall not be healed, they &s;hall be given to Salt.</HI> And even in the Apo&s;tles Times, when there was &s;uch wonderful Succe&s;s of the Go&s;pel, yet wherever they came there were &s;ome that did not believe. Acts 13.48. <HI>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the Word of the Lord, and as many as were ordained to eternal Life believed.</HI> And Chap. 28.24 <HI>And &s;ome believed, and &s;ome believed not.</HI> So we have no Rea&s;on to expect, but there will be &s;ome left among&s;t us. 'Tis to be hoped it will be but a &s;mall Company: But what a dole|ful Company will it be! How darkly and awfully will it look upon them!&mdash;If you &s;hall be of that Company, how well may your Friends and Relations lament over you, and bemoan your dark and dangerous Circum&s;tances!&mdash;If you would not be one of them, make ha&s;te, delay not, and look not behind you.&mdash; Shall all Sorts obtain, &s;hall every one pre&s;s into the Kingdom of God, while you &s;tay loitering behind in a doleful, undone Condition?
