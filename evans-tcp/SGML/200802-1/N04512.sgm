<P>_A Mutual good Affection between Prince and People, engaging them to their re&s;pective Duties, and &s;hewing it&s;elf in the Expre&s;&s;ions of a tender Con|cern for the Safety and Comfort of each other, is always de&s;ireable, and perculiarly &s;o in perilous Times. 'Tis (if I mi&s;take not) exemplify'd in this hi&s;torical Pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred Scripture; and may, on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, be &s;ea&s;onably recommended therefrom.</P>
<P>The great King <HI>David</HI> was Man of War, emi|nently qualified, not only to &s;it on the Throne, and judge his Pople, but al&s;o to march at the Head of Armies into the Field, and fight their Battles. And

by his martial Skill and Atchievements, as well as by his con&s;ummate Policy, ju&s;t and pious Admini|&s;tration, his Reign was glorious to him&s;elf, and happy to his Subjects. It &s;eems to be in the latter End of it, when he was weaken'd with Age, that we here find him at War with the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> in which he <HI>waxed &s;aint. I&s;hhi-henob,</HI> which was of the Sons of the Giant, perceiving that <HI>David</HI>'s Strength fail'd him, &s;et upon him with greater Fury, and thought to have &s;lain the King,
and &s;o defeated the Ho&s;t of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> But <HI>Abi&s;hai,</HI> the Son <HI>Zeruiah,</HI> &s;uccoured him, and &s;mote the <HI>Phili&s;tine,</HI> and killed him. Up|on the King's e&s;caping &s;o great a Danger, his Men re&s;olv'd in Council, and confirm'd it with an Oath, that he &s;hould go no more out with them to Battle, &s;hould never again &s;o hazard his precious and impor|tant Life, as he had often done, for the Safety of his People; left by his Death the <HI>Light</HI> of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;hould be <HI>quenched.</HI>&mdash;Some u&s;eful and pertinent In&s;tructions may be gather'd from this Text: All that I &s;hall offer may be comprized in this general Ob&s;ervation, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That People &s;hould be concern'd for the Pre&s;erva|tion of a good Ruler, who is their Light, and does for their Sakes incur great Difficulties and Hazards.</P>
<P>The Character and Work of a good Ruler, and the Duty of an obliged People, will come under Con&s;ideration in this Di&s;course.</P>
<P>Prop. I. <HI>That a good Ruler is the Light of his People.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="005602_0006_1026A91C4A093E90">So the Men of <HI>David</HI> ju&s;tly thought, and pro|nouc'd him to be, <HI>the Light of</HI> I&s;rael.

<P>Light is an Emblem of Authority. It is the Fir&s;t|born of Things vi&s;ible: Hath the Pre-eminence a|mong them, or Predominancy over them: Was ori|ginally created and de&s;igned to bear Sway in the na|tural World.

and exerci&s;es it to the good End for which it is delegated to him, is the Light of a People.</P>
<P>He is &s;o,</P>
<P N="1">I. As he is their <HI>Guide.</HI> The U&s;e and Benefit of Light is to make us &s;ee, to direct us in our Way. Of &s;uch Advantage is a good Ruler unto his People, enlightning them with Knowledge of the Things, of their Peace, directing them in the Pur&s;uit thereof, and pointing out to them the Way of their Duty and Safety. Job. 29. 25. <HI>I cho&s;e out their Way, and fat Chief, and dwelt as King in the Army.</HI> By a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding Heart, a penetrating Judgment, a provident de&s;crying of Mi&s;chiefs or Advantanges, which may acrue to, or be averted from the Public, by a careful In&s;pection of the State and Manners of People, and &s;trict Ob&s;ervance of their varying Circum&s;tances: By a divine Sentence in his Lips, when his Mouth tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth not in Judgment; by pre|&s;cribing Rules of Ju&s;tice and Equity for all Relations and Conditions of Men, and Kinds of Commerce, in humane Society; by re&s;olving of Doubts, and de|ciding of Controver&s;ies, and exhibiting a bright Example of Piety and Virtue, a Ruler is the direct|ing Light of his People.</P>
<P N="2">2. A good Ruler is the <HI>Comfort</HI> and <HI>Joy,</HI> and &s;o the Light of his People. <HI>Truly Light is &s;ween, and a plea&s;ant Thing it is for the Eyes to behold the Sun.</HI> It cheers the Heart, by working on the Spi|rits, as well as plea&s;es the Eyes: Warms and enli|vens univer&s;al Nature, all &s;en&s;itive and vegetable Creatures: It is benign in its Influence, and produc|tive
<PB N="5" REF="005602_0008_1026A922F4567FA0">
of &s;weet Fruits : And &s;o doth aptly &s;et forth what a good Ruler is to his People, their Joy and Comfort. <HI>When the Righteou&s; are in Authority, the People rejoice. The King by Judgment &s;tabli&s;heth the Land</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. 29. 2, 4.</NOTE>: For then Ju&s;tice is admini&s;tred, Peace and good Order pre&s;erved, the Conveniences of humane Life are &s;afely enjoy'd; Vice is corrected, and Ver|tue encouraged. Innumerable are the Benefits which People receive from a good Government. The plea|&s;ant Fruits of it, the Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace, are more to be rejoiced in, than the precious Fruits brought forth by the Sun, and the precious Things put forth by Moon; and the Influences of it are &s;weeter than the Influences of the Pleiades, and ex|tend far and wide. A good Ruler, &s;eeking the Wealth of his People, and &s;peaking Peace to them, is accep|ted of them, and is <HI>as he that comforteth the Mourners.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A good Ruler is the Light, for he is the <HI>Glory</HI> of his People. Light and Glory are equivalent Terms. The Light is bright and gli&s;tering, and makes other Things con&s;picuous and beautiful. A good Ruler is illu&s;trious, bearing the Image of God's Authority, and &s;hining with the Rays of his Maje&s;ty: He puts on Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and it cloaths him with Honour, and his Judgment is as a Robe of Light, and Diadem of Beauty. His Piety is a &s;parkling Gem in his Crown, and his Glory is reflected on his People. They are dignified and beautified with it. He &s;cattereth away all Evil with his Eyes: Whatever is the Reproach and Ob&s;curity of a People. He &s;aveth them from
<PB N="6" REF="005602_0009_1026A9261ED34028">
tho&s;e Things which would bring or keep them low. He procureth their Advancement, makes them high and honourable among the Nations; &s;preads a Lu&s;tre upon them, and renders them con&s;picuous and fa|mous&mdash;is the Beauty of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. I. I9.</NOTE>. It is by a King's reigning in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and gloriou&s;ly, that the Common-wealth is not over-clouded with Adver&s;ity that the public State becomes &s;erene, and the Face of Things becomes beautiful: "As when the Sun &s;hineth brightly, there is a clear Day, and fair Weather over the World". In the&s;e Re&s;pects is a good Ru|ler the Light of his People.</P>
<P>Prop. II. <HI>That a good Ruler, for the Sake of his People, incurreth many Difficulties and Hazards.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>David</HI> was &s;pirited for, and often per&s;onally enagaged in the Toils and Perils of War, and the <HI>Light of I&s;rael</HI> was &s;orely &s;truck at, and near being quench'd, by the Sword of the Gigantic <HI>Phili&s;tine,</HI> who thought to have &s;lain him, when he waxed faint in Battle, which occa&s;ion'd his Men to &s;ay to him, as in the Text. He u&s;ually, with his Soldiers, jeoparded his own Life in the high Places of the Field, in the Cau&s;e of God and <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> He &s;hewed there|by his affectionate Care of his People, and Zeal to defend them. Every good Ruler, like <HI>David,</HI> is ready, for his People's &s;ake, to engage in difficult and dangerous Enterprizes, when called thereto in Pro|vidence. The Safety of the People is the End of his Office, and his End in undertaking it; which that he may procure, he more or le&s;s expo&s;es their Light
<PB N="7" REF="005602_0010_1026A9287AE47250">
to be quenched. His Work is arduous, in Propor|tion to the Degree of his Authority: Cannot be per|formed with Ea&s;e, nor without Danger to him&s;elf. If he be not, for the Defence of his People, call'd to undergo the Fatigues and Perils of War, yet there are others, great and many, which he cannot be ex|cus'd from. His whole Bu&s;ine&s;s is a Warfare, in re&s;pect of painful Exerci&s;es; the Toils he mu&s;t &s;u&s;|tain; the Wacthfulne&s;s and Diligence he mu&s;t u&s;e; Enemies he mu&s;t encounter, and Oppo&s;ition he has to grapple with. His Office is laborious and vexa|tious, accompanied with Varieties of Care and Fear Trouble and Temptation, and is hard to be di&s;char|ged well or wi&s;ely. He is God's Mini&s;ter, <HI>attending continually upon this very Thing,</HI> Rom. I3. 6.</P>
<P>Clo&s;e Application, Con&s;tancy and Patience are re|quired to the Accompli&s;hment of it. <HI>The Care of his People</HI> cometh on him daily; and is a Weight under which he is liable to &s;ink and &s;ometimes ready to complain, as <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> Numb. 11.11, 12. <HI>Where|fore ha&s;t thou afflicted thy Servant? And wherefore have I not found Favour in thy Sight, that thou laye&s;t the Burden of all this People upon me? Have I con|ceived all this People? Have I begotten them, that thou &s;houlde&s;t &s;ay unto me, Carry them in thy Bo&s;om (as a nur&s;ing Father heareth the &s;uckling Child.)</HI> More Burden proportionably mu&s;t this needs be to the Fle&s;h and Mind, than the private Man finds that hath only a Family to provide for and govern; which yet would &s;eem intollerable, were it not for natural Affection, the Strength of parental Love.</P>
<P>Ignorant and incon&s;iderate mu&s;t they be, who &s;up|po&s;e the Man that doth the Work of a Ruler faith|fully, hath an ea&s;y Ta&s;k; and can live in Idlene&s;s,

"Tho' the cloathing of Authority be &s;plendid, the Sub&s;tance thus covered is extraordinary Labour, and Duty, and Suffering". <HI>Much Study is a Wearine&s;s to the Fle&s;h,</HI> &s;ays the wi&s;e King <HI>Solomon</HI>; who doubtle&s;s found it &s;o in his Re|&s;earches not only into the My&s;teries of Nature, but al&s;o into the Intricacies and Depths of Policy. It is apt, &s;ooner than bodily Labour, to wa&s;te the Strength, to con&s;ume the Spirits, and put out the Lamp of Life. He that is to be a Light unto a People, hath great Occa&s;ion for it, to di&s;cern between Good and Bad, to &s;earch out all Matters involv'd in Darkne&s;s and Perplexity; to frame Laws which may an&s;wer the good Intention of them; the Sen&s;e of which may not ea&s;ily be perverted, nor the Force evaded; to apply the general Rules of Ju&s;tice to the great Variety of particular Ca&s;es; to devi&s;e Means for the Redre&s;s of public Grievances, and the Prevention of impend|ing Mi&s;chiefs, and Emolument of the Republic; to manage with Di&s;cretion the Affairs of Governmen which are very important, and often embarra&s;t.</P>

It was not prudent in him &s;o to expo&s;e him&s;elf, in who&s;e Safety the Pub|lic was &s;o much intere&s;ted; nor decent in them &s;o peremptorily to declare again&s;t it; and neither the one, nor the other, is to be drawn into Precedent in ordinary Ca&s;es; yet the affectionate Concern expre&s;s'd for each others Pre&s;ervation is exemplary. A King &s;heweth a Regard to the Safety of his People, by going in Per&s;on to Battle. And they te&s;tify their Care of him, by their Unwillingne&s;s that he &s;hould. Whether it be advi&s;eable, or not, in him, to put his Life to &s;uch Hazard for their Sakes, or in them to oppo&s;e it; yet it is commendable in both to have
<PB N="11" REF="005602_0014_1026A93149761A98">
&s;uch a tender Regard for one another, as is manife&s;ted thereby, exerting it &s;elf in all proper Ways of mu|tual Defence. What the&s;e Ways are on the People's Part, be&s;ides this which we have in the Text an In|&s;tance of, may be &s;hewn, after I have put them in Mind of the Obligations lying upon them, to &s;eek the Pre&s;ervation of a good Ruler, that their Light be not quenched; totally, nor partially: To &s;eek his Pre&s;ervation, as he is their Light&mdash;his Pre&s;erva|tion, not only Life ard Being, but in his Splendor and Strength, Influence, U&s;efulne&s;s and Glory.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Commandment, with Promi&s;e, requires it. <HI>Honour thy Father. Honour the King</HI>; this we do not &s;ufficiently, according to the Obligation of this Precept, by giving him high Titles, and loud Ap|plau&s;es, and the external Significations of Reverence, in unveiling and cringing to him; but by more &s;ub&s;tantial Demon&s;trations of Re&s;pect, and affectio|nate Concern to pre&s;erve him, in his honourable State.</P>
<P>The Relation which there is between Ruler and People implies this Duty of their's towards him. It is con&s;tituted by the wi&s;e and good Governour of all, not for the Safety and Benefit of the People only, without Con&s;ideration of the Rulers; but to engage both in a mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Defence. It is found|ed in the natural Right which Men have to each other's Love and Care, and is de&s;igned for the better Exerci&s;e of the &s;ame. Were it not for this Relation they could not &s;o well be each one his Brother's Keeper. By Virtue of it, the Wi&s;dom and Strength given Mankind, for the Pre&s;ervation of the Species, may be improv'd to far greater Advantages. As the whole natural Body is the better &s;ecured, by having

the Eyes in the Head, and the Strength in the Arms. The Ruler is to protect the People by his Wi&s;dom and Authority, and they him by their E&s;tates and Strength. Ju&s;tice demands this of them: Yea, Gra|titude con&s;trains them to it. 'Tis plainly equitable that they &s;hould be concern'd for his Safety, who is &s;o much for theirs, as a good Ruler is.
