<P>_THE Great GOD that formed all Things, and in particular for|med the Spirit of Man within him, has been plea&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h him from, and exalt him above, all other Creatures in this lower World, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.26, 27.</P>
<P>IN his Nature, Man was here|in more e&s;pecially advanced, that he was endued with an Un|der&s;tanding and Rea&s;onable Soul, and &s;o made capable of acting as a Cau&s;e by Coun&s;el, and of governing his Inferiour Powers by Moral Principles and Rules; and
<PB N="2" REF="002152_0003_0FBC77EA6FDB4820">
in this way, of aiming at his chief and highe&s;t End, which is to Glorify the Great GOD his Creator, and be happy in the Enjoyment of Him for ever.</P>
<P>THUS hath GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ught Men <HI>more than the Bea&s;ts of the Earth,</HI> and made them <HI>wi&s;er than the Fowls of Heaven,</HI> Job 35.11.</P>
<P>AND as GOD has greatly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Man in <HI>Making</HI> him &s;uch an Excellent Creature; &s;o He has done the like al&s;o in the way of his <HI>Dealing with</HI> him, ever &s;ince He fir&s;t gave him his Being.</P>
<P>THUS GOD has done, while He has continually treated Man as a Creature, in re&s;pect of his natural Powers, capable of under&s;tanding his own Duty, and of aiming at his proper End, of choo&s;ing his own way, and weighing the Obligations which he lieth under, to &s;erve the Lord; and of con&s;idering the Equity of His Dealings with him, and pur&s;uing tho&s;e things that are of the greate&s;t Importance and Advantage to him.</P>
<P>ONE In&s;tance of GOD's dealing thus with Men we have in the Words now under Con&s;ideration. Towards the beginning of the Chapter, He does by the Prophet Expo&s;tulate with His Covenant People of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> on the Account of their many heinous Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions; and in particular He upbraids them with the want of Con&s;ideration, as the Cau&s;e of all their other Mi&s;carriages. Ver&s;e 3. <HI>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the A&s;s his Ma&s;ters crib; but I&s;rael doth not know, my People doth not con&s;ider.</HI> He blames them for this, That tho' they were Rational Creatures, yet they did not improve their Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding as they ought to do.</P>
<P>FROM the 5th to the 9th Ver&s;e, He declareth unto them what heavy Judgments they had expo&s;ed them|&s;elves unto by their Iniquities; and becau&s;e they were too apt to Plead their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, in re&s;pect
<PB N="3" REF="002152_0004_0FBC77EB86BC3E40">
of the many Outward Religious Services, which they Performed; GOD does from Ver&s;e 10. to 15. reject all the&s;e Services of theirs as vain and unacceptable to Him, becau&s;e while they performed them, they con|tinued &s;till in their wicked and mo&s;t abominable Prac|tices. He therefore exhorts them unto Repentance and Reformation, as the &s;ure and only way to e&s;cape His Judgments, and come to enjoy His Favour, from Ver&s;. 16. to 19.</P>
<P>AND whereas this People were often too ready to think GOD dealt hardly with them, when their Out|ward Performances found no acceptance with Him, as in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 58.3. <HI>Wherefore have we fa&s;ted, &s;ay they, and thou &s;ee&s;t it not,</HI> &amp;c. He offereth in the Wards before us to argue the Ca&s;e with them, and invites them as Rea|&s;onable Creatures, to a Rational Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the Mat|ter in Controver&s;y betwixt Him and them, that &s;o He might in this way clear up the Equity of His Dealings with them, and make it evident that the Terms of Peace were very rea&s;onable, yea very gracious, which He now propounded to them.</P>
<P>I am not now to con&s;ider the matter then in Contro|ver&s;y betwixt GOD and that People; but the Invita|tion it &s;elf, which the Lord was plea&s;ed to give them to come to a fair Debate upon the Point, <HI>Come now and let us rea&s;on together, &s;aith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THE meaning of the Words is not, that GOD would Vi&s;ibly appear to them, and Di&s;pute with them Face to Face, as one Man Di&s;putes with another, (though there &s;eems to be in the Words an Allu&s;ion unto &s;uch a Di&s;pute) but GOD here &s;peaks unto His People after the manner of Men, and the de&s;ign of His Words is to &s;ignify to them that as He had to do with rea&s;ona|ble Creatures; &s;o His Dealings with them were &s;uch as Rea&s;on would ju&s;tifie and di&s;cover to be mo&s;t ju&s;t and equal, yea and exceeding Merciful al&s;o, as they them&s;elves, upon a due Improvement of their Under|&s;tanding might evidently &s;ee.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002152_0005_0FBC77ED0A44B538">THE DOCTRINE I would ob&s;erve from the Words is this, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P>DOCTRINE, THAT, <HI>GOD Dealeth with Men as with Rea&s;onable Creatures.</HI></P>
<P>FOR the clearing up of this Truth, I &s;hall endea|vour, 1. <HI>To &s;hew that GOD doth indeed thus Deal with Men.</HI> 2. <HI>To give &s;ome Re&s;ons why He does &s;o.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> I SHALL <HI>Shew that GOD does indeed Deal thus with Men.</HI> And this I &s;hall make evident by an <HI>Induction of &s;everal In&s;tances,</HI> wherein He Deals thus with them.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P><HI>In&s;tance,</HI> 1. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <HI>In that He taketh Care, and u&s;eth Means to in&s;truct them in Sublime and Excellent My&s;teries, which only Rational and Intelligent Beings can uder&s;tand.</HI> Very Great and Excellent are the My&s;teries which the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD is in the way of His Dealing with the Children of Men, taking Care to In&s;truct them in. 1 Tim 3.16. <HI>Without controver&s;y great is the Mi&s;tery of Godline&s;s, God was manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h, justified in the Spirit, &s;een of Angels, preached unto the Gen|tiles, believed on in the World, received up into Glory.</HI></P>
<P>THE Doctrine of the Trinity in the Unity of the Godhead, and of the Decrees of GOD and His Provi|dence, and the Incarnation of the Son of GOD; and the way of Redemption and Salvation by Him, and the like; are My&s;teries very wonderful indeed. They are My&s;teries which the <HI>Angels de&s;ire to look into,</HI> 1 Pet 2.12 They are fitly called, <HI>The deep things of God,</HI> 1 Cor 2.10</P>
<P>BUT &s;uch things as the&s;e, GOD is plea&s;ed to be ma|king known unto Men, by His Word written in the Holy Scriptures; and by His Mini&s;ters, whom he &s;ends to explain His Oracles unto them. <HI>He hath written
<PB N="5" REF="002152_0006_0FBC77EE84524708">
to them the great things of His Law,</HI> Ho&s;. 8.12. And is by His Servants making known to them the Rich and Glorious My&s;teries of the Go&s;pel. as <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eph.</HI> Chap. 3. and <HI>Col.</HI> 1.25.27.</NOTE> the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> does in his Epi&s;tles declare: And tho&s;e My&s;teries He Revealeth &s;avingly by His Spirit, to as many as He plea&s;eth as <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> Chap. 2. throughout.</NOTE> the Scriptures al&s;o te&s;tify.</P>
<P>THAT GOD thus taketh Care and u&s;eth Means to In&s;truct the Children of Men in the Great Truths and My&s;teries of the Go&s;pel, does certainly &s;uppo&s;e them to have Excellent Under&s;tandings in them, capa|ble of receiving the In&s;tructions of Wi&s;dom which are by Him de&s;igned for their Illumination; and GOD herein treateth Men as Creatures that have a Capacity to <HI>Know Wi&s;dom and In&s;truction,</HI> and <HI>to perceive the Words of Under&s;tanding,</HI> Prov. 1.2.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;tance,</HI> 2. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <HI>In that He directeth them to him at a mo&s;t Excellent End, and by the mo&s;t proper and &s;uitable means to pur&s;ue it.</HI> Thus to Glo|rify GOD, and to enjoy <HI>Him</HI> for ever, is the Great End which <HI>He</HI> requireth Men to aim at, and in order to their compa&s;&s;ing this End, they are commanded to make u&s;e of the mo&s;t &s;uitable Means, and in the Improvement of the&s;e, to <HI>Work out their own Salvation,</HI> Phil. 2.12. Unto this End Men are required diligently to attend and improve all the Means of Grace that GOD is plea|&s;ed to favour them withal. This is what is intended by their <HI>Hearing of Wi&s;dom, watching daily at her Gates, and waiting at the Po&s;ts of her Doors,</HI> Prov. 8.34.</P>
<P>NOW thus aiming at a determinate End, and fixing upon, and making u&s;e of the mo&s;t proper and &s;uitable Means for the attainment of it, does certainly &s;uppo&s;e Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding in tho&s;e that do or ought to do it; and when GOD puts Men upon thus acting
<PB N="6" REF="002152_0007_0FBC77F00B2F0980">
He treats them as Intelligent and Rational Beings, and Honours them as Creatures capable of the highe&s;t Views, and the mo&s;t Excellent Employments and Enjoyments.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;tance,</HI> 3. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <HI>In that He Dealeth with them in the way of a Covenant, which the Unrea&s;onable part of the Creation are utter by uncapable of.</HI> It is certain that GOD has always dealt with Mankind in a Covenant way. When Man was fir&s;t Created, GOD entred into a Covenant of Works with him, promi&s;ing Life to him, on Condition of perfect and perpetual Obedience; and threatning him with Death in ca&s;e of the lea&s;t Failure, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10, 12. And after Mankind had in <HI>Adam</HI> their Common Head and Repre&s;entative broken that Covenant, GOD was plea&s;ed to propo&s;e another Covenant, unto them, <HI>viz.</HI> The New-Covenant or Covenant of Grace, according unto which they might be delivered from the Cur&s;e and Death due to them on the Account of their Violation of the Covenant, fir&s;t made with them, and might al&s;o obtain Eternal Happine&s;s through a Glorious Redeemer provided for them.</P>
<P>THIS Covenant was, tho' in ob&s;cure. Terms, pro|po&s;ed for the Relief of Sinful Man, &s;oon after his Fall into Sin, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15. but has been more fully opened and explained, unto Sinners &s;ince in the Scriptures, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e of the New-Te&s;tament, as in <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.8. to 10. and el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e Covenants are expre&s;&s;ed the Duties which Men owe unto GOD, according to the Tenure of them, and the Sins al&s;o which are contrary unto the&s;e Du|ties. Here al&s;o are &s;et down the Rewards and Puni&s;h|ments, which Men are to expect according as they do or do not keep Covenant with the Lord their GOD, as in <HI>Deut.</HI> Chap. 28.</P>
<P>UNDER one or other of the&s;e Covenants all Man|kind are. Tho&s;e who have not laid hold of the Cove|nant
<PB N="7" REF="002152_0008_0FBC77F429014C98">
of Grace, or Accepted the Terms of it, are &s;till under the Covenant of Works, and mu&s;t &s;tand or fall according as they do, or do not fulfill the Conditions of it; which &s;ince the fall it is impo&s;&s;ible any Man in his own Per&s;on &s;hould do. Therefore &s;uch as are under the Law of Works are under the Cur&s;e, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10, 12. Tho&s;e who lay hold of the Covenant of Grace, are by GOD dealt withal according to the Tenure of that Covenant, <HI>Rome</HI> 6.14. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.7, &mdash; 9.</P>
<P>THUS GOD treateth Men in the way of a Cove|nant, and every Man mu&s;t receive a Reward accor|ding to the Tenure of that Covenant, wherein he &s;tandeth related unto GOD; and while GOD does thus deal with Men in a Covenant way, He Dealeth with them as with Rational Beings; He treateth them as &s;uch as are capable of Under&s;tanding the Nature of a Covenant, the Conditions of that in which them|&s;elves are; and &s;o the Terms wherein they &s;tand with GOD, who has been plea&s;ed to enter into Covenant with them, as al&s;o of weighing on the one hand the Advantages they may have by complying with what is in the Covenant required of them; and on the o|ther, of Counting the co&s;t of their neglecting, or refu|&s;ing &s;o to do.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;tance,</HI> 4. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <HI>In that He putteth them upon making their own free and del<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">te Choice, and that in Ca&s;es wherein their Choo&s;ing well, is of very great Importance.</HI> There are innumerable Ca&s;es e|very Day occurring, wherein Men are called to choo&s;e either what is be&s;t to be done, or mo&s;t de&s;irable to be enjoyed, or mo&s;t carefully to be avoided, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Indeed all tho&s;e Actions wherein Men are obliged to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from Bruits, ought to be ordered and governed, by a Free and Wi&s;e Choice of their &s;e|veral Objects, Means, manner of Performance, and Circum&s;tances of Time and Place, with what&s;oever
<PB REF="002152_0009_0FBC77F569FBDD20">
el&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary to render them every way good and profitable.</P>
<P>BUT there is e&s;pecially one Ca&s;e wherein GOD puts Men unto their own free Choice, wherein their choo&s;ing well, is of the la&s;t Importance to them; and GOD in putting Men to their Choice in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, does evidently treat them as &s;uch, as have good Under&s;tandings in them, capable of making &s;uch a Choice as they ought to do. In &s;uch a weighty Ca&s;e <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> were in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, put upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Deut. 10.19. <HI>I call Heaven and Earth to Record this Day again&s;t you&punc; that I have &s;et before you Life and Death, Ble&s;&s;ing and Cur&s;ing; therefore choo&s;e Life, that thou and thy Seed may Live.</HI> So in, Jo&s;h. 24.15. <HI>If it &s;eem evil to you to &s;erve the Lord, Choo&s;e you this Day whom you will &s;erve,</HI> &amp;c. GOD does not here leave Men unto their Liberty, whether they will &s;erve him, or other Gods; but does require them to make u&s;e of their Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding in making &s;uch a Choice of the Object of their Wor&s;hip, as may be for their own be&s;t Good. GOD accordingly commends &s;uch as choo&s;e well for them&s;elves. Luke 10.42. <HI>Many hath Cho&s;en that good part, that &s;hall not be taken away from her.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In&s;tance,</HI> 5. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> that upon all Occa&s;ions He u&s;eth Arguments with them, proper unto Rational Beings, to pre&s;s and excite them unto their Duty, and to di&s;wade them from doing tho&s;e things that are evil in His Sight.</HI> When GOD calleth upon Men to fear and &s;erve Him, He &s;till urgeth them to their Du|ty herein with &s;uch Arguments as none but Intelligent and Rational Beings can under&s;tand, and be influenced by. GOD never requireth any Service of Men with|out giving them good Rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES indeed GOD pre&s;&s;eth Men to Obe|dience from the Con&s;ideration of His own Sovereign Authority and Dominion over them, as in Lev. 19.30.
<PB N="9" REF="002152_0010_0FBC77F6D770BF68">
<HI>Ob&s;erve all my Statutes and all my Judgments, and do them. I am the Lord</HI>; but what can be a more &s;trong and forceable Rea&s;on for Obedience than this is? Nay un|le&s;s this Influence Men in what they do, there is really nothing of Obedience therein.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the Rea&s;on with which Obedience is pre&s;&s;ed is taken from the Excellency of the Things re|quired as in Micah 6 8. <HI>He hath &s;hewed thee O Man what is good, and what not the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> require of thee, but to do <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God</HI>?</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the Good that GOD has done to and for Men is urged as a Rea&s;on to excite their Obedi|ence unto Him as in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sam 12.24. <HI>Only fear the Lord, and &s;erve him in truth with all your heart, for con&s;ider how great thines He hath done for you.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN Sometimes Men are pre&s;&s;ed unto Obedi|ence from the Con&s;ideration of the Great Advantages they may receive thereby This Argument <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> u&s;ed in our Context I&s;a 1 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>If ye are willing and obedient, ye &s;hall eat the good of the Land,</HI> and P&s;al 37.3 <HI>Tru&s;t in the Lord and do good, &s;o &s;halt thou aw<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> in the Land and verily thou &s;halt be fed.</HI></P>
<P>THUS al&s;o when GOD would di&s;&s;wade Men from doing tho&s;e things which are evil in his Sight; He always gives them good Argument for what He &s;ayes to them</P>
<P>SOMETIMES He urgeth them with the Con&s;ide|rations of the Intrin&s;ick evil of tho&s;e Sins he would re|&s;train them from, So in Lev 18 18. <HI>It is an Abomination,</HI> and Jer. 44.4 <HI>O do not this Abominable thing that I hate.</HI></P>
<P>SOMETIMES Men are informed that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> doing &s;uch things they will greatly provoke a Holy and Jea|lous GOD, and Incen&s;e His Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t them; and that thus to do is the greate&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> 1 Cor. 11 22. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> provoke the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to Jealou&s;y <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> than He?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="002152_0011_0FBC77F88E814990">SOMETIMES Again, GOD lets Men know how unworthy and di&s;ingenious they will &s;hew them&s;elves to be, if by their Iniquities they Reward Him Evil for His Goodne&s;s. Deut. 32.6. <HI>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O fooli&s;h and unwi&s;e? Is He not thy Father that bought thee? Hath He not made thee and formed thee</HI>? When GOD thus Argueth with Men He certainly Dealeth with them as with Rea&s;onable Creatures.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;tance,</HI> 6. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <HI>In that as occa&s;ion does require, He u&s;eth Means to Convince them of the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of their Actions and Carriages towards Him.</HI> As GOD would in a Rational way re&s;train Men from Sin; &s;o when they have Sinned, He u&s;eth Rati|onal Methods to convince them of their Folly and Madne&s;s in Departing from Him, and to bring them unto a due &s;en&s;e of the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of their De|portment and Behaviour before Him.</P>
<P>TO this end GOD &s;hews &s;uch as have departed from Him, and by their Sins provoked Him, That they have no good Plea or Excu&s;e to make for their &s;o do|ing. So in Judg. 2.2. <HI>Ye have not obeyed my Voice: Why have ye done this</HI>? Hear how GOD argueth with I&s;rael to this purpo&s;e, Jer. 2 5, 6 <HI>What Iniquity have your Fathers found in me that they are gone far from me, and have walked after Vanity and are become vain? Neither &s;aid they where is the Lord that brought us up out of Aegypt,</HI> &amp;c. Al&s;o Micah 6.2, 3. <HI>The Lord hath a Controver&s;y with His People, and will plead with I&s;rael, O my People, What have I done unto thee, and wherein have I wearied thee? Te&s;tify against Me.</HI> Thus GOD convinceth His People that they have nothing to alledge again&s;t Him as a Rea&s;on of their for&s;aking of Him.</P>
<P>TO the &s;ame End GOD frequently &s;heweth Men now unrea&s;onable their Carriages are in re&s;pect of the Ingratitude of which they are guilty in them; &s;o in I&s;a. 1.2, <HI>I have nouri&s;hed and brought up Children, and they

have rebelled again&s;t me.</HI> Al&s;o I&s;a. 63.9.10. <HI>In all their affliction he was afflicted; and the Angel of his Pre&s;ence &s;aved them, in his love and in his pity be redeemed them, and he have them, and carryed them all the Dayes of old. But they rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> 32.9, &mdash; 19, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6 24.</NOTE> This Argument is much in&s;i&s;ted on in Scripture, GOD would have Men &s;ee that &s;uch a deportment before Him, is very unrea|&s;onable.</P>
<P>WITH the &s;ame de&s;ign GOD &s;ometimes &s;hews Men how ab&s;urd and ridiculous their Practices are, that &s;o He may make them a&s;hamed of their Abominations. Thus GOD by a Prophet &s;aid to <HI>Amaziah,</HI> 2 Chron. 25.15. <HI>Why ha&s;t thou &s;ought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thy hand</HI>? In this way GOD would have made <HI>I&s;rael</HI> a&s;hamed of their Idolatry, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 44. from ver. 9. to 18. where ha|ving at large expo&s;ed the ab&s;urdity of their fir&s;t ma|king gods and then falling down and wor&s;hipping the &s;ame; He in Ver&s;e 19. &s;peaketh thus to, and of them. <HI>None con&s;idereth in his heart, neither is their knowledge, nor under&s;tanding to &s;ay, I have burnt part of it in the Fire; yea al&s;o I have baked bread upon the Coals thereof: I have roa&s;ted Fle&s;h and eaten it; and &s;hall I make the re&s;idue thereof an Abomination? &s;hall I fall down to the Stock of a Tree?</HI></P>
<P>WHEN GOD thus &s;heweth Men how unrea&s;onably they act in Sinning again&s;t Him, He Dealeth with them as with Rea&s;onable Creatures.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;tance,</HI> 7. GOD thus Dealeth with Men, <HI>In that as need calls for it, He clears up to then the equity of His Dealings with them.</HI> Men are very apt to find fault with GOD; and to quarrel at His Di&s;pen&s;ations; they are often ready to think that GOD Dealeth hardly with them: but He is ever ready to give pro|per and &s;uitable An&s;wers to what they have to Object

again&s;t Him, and to make it evident that He no way wrongs them. Thus in our Text, GOD calls His People to Rea&s;on with Him&punc; that &s;o He might make them &s;ee the Equity, yea the Kindne&s;s of His way of Dealing with them.</P>
<P>GOD indeed &s;ometimes An&s;wers Men's proud and unrea&s;onable cavils again&s;t Him, by a&s;&s;erting His own ab&s;olute Soveraignity over them, and &s;o His Right to do with them, what &s;eemeth good in His &s;ight. But even then, when GOD pleadeth His own ab&s;olute Dominion over Men, He &s;till dealeth with them as with Rational and Intelligent Beings, in that He &s;heweth them that it is highly Rea&s;onable, that He &s;hould exerci&s;e &s;uch a Dominion over every thing that He has made. To this purpo&s;e GOD argueth with Men, in <HI>Rom. Chap.</HI> 9. <HI>Ver.</HI> 19. Men are brought in thus Di&s;puting again&s;t GOD, <HI>Why doth he yet find fault, for who hath re&s;i&s;ted his will?</HI> Unto which cavil GOD by the Apo&s;tle thus an&s;wereth, Ver&s;e 20, 21. <HI>Nay but O Man, who art thou that replye&s;t against God? Shall the thing formed &s;ay unto him that formed it, Why ha&s;t thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, of the &s;ame lump to make one Ve&s;&s;el unto honour, and another to di&s;honour</HI>?</P>
<P>SOMETIMES GOD is plea&s;ed to an&s;wer Mens Objections again&s;t Him, without thus in&s;i&s;ting upon His own ab&s;olute Soveraignty. Thus in <HI>Ezek.</HI> Chap. 18. GOD an&s;wereth the Objection made by the Peo|ple again&s;t Him, <HI>That the Fathers had eaten &s;owre Grapes, and the Childrens teeth were &s;et on edge</HI>; by which was meant that the Children were puni&s;hed for the Sins of the Parents, and from this the People inferred, <HI>That the way of the Lord was not equal.</HI></P>
<P>IN An&s;wer unto this Objection, GOD &s;hewed the People their great mi&s;take, in alleging that Children were puni&s;hed for their Parents Sins. He &s;hewed them at large, that the Soul that Sinneth &s;hall die; and that
<PB N="13" REF="002152_0014_0FBC77FE8144B8E8">
the Son &s;hall not bear the Iniquity of the Father; nei|ther the Father bear the Iniquity of the Son, but that every one &s;hall be Rewarded according to his own Works; and then He proceeded thus to Expo&s;tulate with them. Ver. 29. <HI>Yet ye &s;ay the way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now O hou&s;e of I&s;rael, Are not my ways equal? Are not your ways unequal</HI>?</P>
<P>THUS al&s;o GOD cleareth up the Equity of His Dealings with His People with re&s;pect to the Means He afforded them for their good. GOD con&s;idereth Men as Rea&s;onable Creatures, and therefore affordeth them &s;ufficient Means for the Ends He obligeth them to pur&s;ue and pro&s;ecute. He puteth a Price into their hands to be improved for their Advantage, <HI>Prov.</HI> 17 16. He di&s;tributeth Talents unto one and another, accor|ding to their re&s;pective Abilities, and requireth them to trade with them <HI>Mith.</HI> 25.14, 15, 16. And if it be needful, He convinceth them, that nothing hath been wanting on His part, that could Rea&s;onably be ex|pected of Him, in Order to the promoting of their Hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>THUS GOD Convinced the <HI>Jews</HI> of the Sufficien|cy of the Means and Cultivations He afforded to them, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 5.1, &mdash; 5. Where &s;peaking of them under the Similitude of a Vineyard. He (1.) declareth that He had <HI>Planted this Vineyard of his, in a very fruitful Hill, and had fenced it, and gathered out the Stones thereof, and plan|ted it with the choi&s;e&s;t Vine,</HI> &amp;c. thereby &s;ignifying what Means He had u&s;ed, and what Co&s;t and Pains He had been at, for the good of His People. (2) He &s;hews them the Expectation He thereupon had that His Vine|yard would have brought forth good Fruit, <HI>He looked that it would have brought forth Grapes</HI> (3.) He decla|reth the di&s;appointment He had with re&s;pect hereto, <HI>It brought forth Wild Grapes</HI>; bad Fruit, in&s;tead of good. (4.) He hereupon thus Rea&s;oneth with His People, this Vineyard of His. <HI>And now O Inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem,
<PB N="14" REF="002152_0015_0FBC7800760A7130">
and Men of Judah, judge I pray you betwixt me, and my Vineyard; What could have been done more to my Vineyard than I have done in it? Wherefore when I looked that it &s;hould bring forth Grapes, brought it forth Wild Grapes</HI>?</P>
<P>SURELY, this is to deal with Men as with Rea&s;o|nable Creatures; GOD does here Appeal unto His People's own Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience, whether He had not dealt very well by them, in affording a &s;ufficiency of Means to them; &s;o that their unfruitfulne&s;s did evidently appear to be from their own unrea&s;onable and culpable neglect; and was not in any wi&s;e to be Charged upon Him. He let them know that He dealt not by them as tho&s;e <HI>unrea&s;onable Men</HI> their <HI>Aegyptian Task masters</HI> had formerly done, in requiring Brick of them in full Tale; but not affording them Straw, <HI>Exod.</HI> Chap. 5.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;tance,</HI> 8. GOD dealeth thus with Men, <HI>In that He cleareth up to them, the fairne&s;s of the Proce&s;s at the Great A&s;&s;ize or Day of Judgment; and the Ju&s;tice of the Sen|tence, that &s;hall then be pa&s;&s;ed upon both Good and Bad.</HI> As Men are fully a&s;&s;ured that there will be a Great and General Day of Judgment, in which all Rational and Intelligent Creatures, mu&s;t give an Account of them&s;elves and of their Actions unto GOD, (as it is Rea&s;on they &s;hould do,) <HI>Acts</HI> 17.31. <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.12. So GOD al&s;o a&s;&s;ures them that the Proceedings of that Day &s;hall be mo&s;t Ju&s;t and Rea&s;onable. He does a&s;|&s;ure Men that things &s;hall not in that Day be managed in a way merely Arbitary, without re&s;pect to Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice; but that all Cau&s;es and Pleas &s;hall be then duly heard &amp; con&s;idered, &amp; that Right Judgment accor|ding to Law and Evidence, &s;hall then proceed.</P>
<P><HI>THE Books therefore are then to be Opened, and the dead,</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> tho&s;e that were &s;o) <HI>are to be judged accor|ding to the things written therein, according to their Works,</HI> Rev. 20.12. Therefore, <HI>Every Work mu&s;t be</HI> then

There will be no partiality then u&s;ed, but Sentence will be given without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.6. &mdash; 11. Then as many as have Sinned without the written Law of GOD, &s;hall be Puni&s;hed without it; and as many as have Sinned under the Law, &s;hall be judged by it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.12. &mdash; 16 Every one &s;hall then be convinced, that the judgment of GOD is according to Truth, again&s;t tho&s;e that do &s;uch things as Men &s;hall be puni&s;hed for The End of the la&s;t Judgment as it re&s;pects the wicked, is not only that they may be puni&s;hed but al&s;o that they may be convinced of their wickedne&s;s, and of the Ju&s;tice of GOD, in the Sen|tence pa&s;&s;ed on them. <HI>For behold the Lord cometh with ten thou&s;and of his Saints, to execute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all the hard &s;peeches, which ungodly Sinners have &s;poken again&s;t him,</HI> Jude, ver. 14.15. Not only the Con&s;ciences; but even the Mouths of wicked Men &s;hall then bear witne&s;s again&s;t them&s;elves. Luk. 19.22, 23. <HI>Out of thine own Mouth will I Judge thee, thou wicked Servant,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>HOW fair the Proce&s;s of the Great and la&s;t Day of Judgment will be, and how ju&s;t the Sentence, both with re&s;pect to the Righteous, and the wicked; Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Great Judge, does Him&s;elf a&s;&s;ure us, <HI>Math.</HI> 25.31, &mdash; 46 where the rea&s;on of the Sentence, with re&s;pect unto both, is di&s;tinctly cleared up, that every one may &s;ee the Ju&s;tice and Equity of it.

<P>HOW often do we find GOD in Scripture, putting Men upon the Study and Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e things wherein His Glory is concerned, and which the Con|&s;ideration of, may be of Advantage to them&s;elves. Thus GOD requireth that Men <HI>Know and con&s;ider in their hearts, that the Lord he is God in Heaven above, and in the earth beneath, and that there is none el&s;e,</HI> Deut. 4.39. And that they <HI>Stand &s;till and con&s;ider the wondrous works of God,</HI> Job 37.14. That they <HI>Con&s;ider what great things God hath done for them,</HI> 1 Sam 12.24.

<P>THESE and many other things of the like Impor|tance, GOD is in His Word, putting Men upon the Con&s;ideration of, and it is certain that He herein treateth them as Rational and Intelligent Beings capa|ble of proper Meditations and Reflections upon the va|rious Objects propo&s;ed to their Contemplation; which that they really are, has been &s;uppo&s;ed in all that has

<HEAD>II. <HI>TO give &s;ome Rea&s;ons Why He does &s;o.</HI> And they are &s;uch as here follow, <HI>viz.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> 1. GOD dealeth with Men as with Rea|&s;onable Creatures; <HI>Becau&s;e &s;uch they are, and it is very &s;uitable that they &s;hould by GOD be dealt withal in &s;uch a Way as is agreeable to the Natures by Him&s;elf given unto them.</HI> As there is an excellent Harmony among the Divine Attributes; &s;o there is a very remarkable agree|ment among the Divine Operations: This appears in GODs delighting to work in, with, and by Se|cond Cau&s;es, in a way agreeable to the Natural Qua|lities and Di&s;po&s;itions, which He Him&s;elf has put into them In this He &s;hews His Wi&s;dom, and puts an Honour upon the works of His own Hands: He here|by &s;hews that it is not in vain that He has put &s;uch Principles and Qualities into them, &s;eeing He maketh u&s;e of them, and worketh with and by them in the Government of the World. As therefore Inanimate and Irrational Creatures are governed in a way &s;uitable to the Natures given unto them; &s;o al&s;o Rationable and Intelligent Beings, as Angels and Men, are ruled and ordered in &s;uch a way, as is agreeable unto the excellent Natures with which they are indued. Man therefore being a Rea&s;onable Creature, GOD con|&s;tantly deals with him as &s;uch an One, treating him in a way agreeable to his Nature, and influencing of him by &s;uch Means as none but Intelligent Beings can be moved by.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> 2. GOD dealeth thus with Men, <HI>Becau&s;e the Nature of the Government which He has &s;et up over them
<PB N="18" REF="002152_0019_0FBC7808A0DD5C50">
does Nece&s;&s;arily call for it.</HI> As GOD made Men capa|ble of being governed by Laws with Sanctions, which Irrational Creatures are not; &s;o He has determined to govern them by &s;uch Laws, <HI>viz.</HI> Precepts and Pro|hibitions, with Promi&s;es and Threatnings: But now the Nature of this kind of Government does require that Men be dealt withal as Intelligent and Rational Beings, capable of acting as Free-Agents; and of being influenced by Moral con&s;iderations; and if they were moved in any other way, as by meer Phy&s;ical Influ|ence, this would not agree unto the Nature of a mo|ral &s;ubjection unto GOD, which con&s;i&s;ts in a Spon|taneous, or Voluntary Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion unto His Will: Therefore if Men &s;hould in the&s;e things be dealt withal in any other way than as Rea&s;onable Creatures, they could be no more &s;aid to obey GOD in their Motions, than Irrational Animals, and Crea|tures without Life, may be &s;aid to do; which would be very far from that Rea&s;onable Service which GOD requireth of Men, and will only accept at their Hands.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> 3. GOD dealeth thus with Men, <HI>Becau&s;e this way &s;utes well with His De&s;ign of di&s;playing His own Glory, and being admired on the account of it.</HI> Tho' GOD might have been Perfectly and Eternally happy in the Enjoyment of Him&s;elf, tho' no Creature had ever been made; yet it hath plea&s;ed Him to create the World to be a kind of Mirror wherein His own Glory may be &s;een and admired; and to make a Number of Crea|tures capable of viewing His Perfections &s;hining forth therein, and of giving Him Glory on the account of them.</P>
<P>UNTO this Number Mankind belong, and as they are capable of glorifying <HI>GOD</HI> in an active way, &s;o this is the Sum of what <HI>He</HI> requires of them: And that He may effectually oblige them to perform their duty herein, He treats them as Rea&s;onable and Intelli|gent
<PB N="19" REF="002152_0020_0FBC7809CFE0D5A8">
Beings, capable of Under&s;tanding their Duty and doing it, and of &s;eeing the Obligations they lye un|der, willingly to engage in the Great Work incumbent on them. He requireth them to behold &amp; admire His Glory, which appeareth in His admirable works of Creation, Providence, and Redemption; and then to &s;hew forth His Prai&s;e unto Others, by <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 96.3. <HI>&amp;</HI> 105.2.</NOTE> Talking of the Marvellous things that He hath done.

He lets them know <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 96.7, 8. <HI>Rev.</HI> 15.4.</NOTE> that Glory is due to Him, and how rea&s;onable a thing it is that they &s;hould render it to His Name.</P>
<P>AND GOD does not only thus call and require Men to give Glory to Him but gives rational An&s;wers to all &s;uch Objections as they are ready to make a|gain&s;t it. He takes up all the &s;tumbling Blocks out of the way, that nothing may hinder them from per|forming their duty herein; and if there be any thing that &s;eemeth to reflect Di&s;honour upon Him, He plainly and fairly removeth it, as in <HI>James</HI> 1.13, 14.</P>
<P>NOW in all this, Men are treated as Rea&s;onable Creatures, and that they &s;hould be &s;o, tends &s;o much to GODs Glory, and &s;utes &s;o well with His De&s;ign of exalting His own Name, that this may be looked upon as one Rea&s;on of His dealing thus with them.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> 4. <HI>THERE is much to be a&s;cribed unto the Soveraign good Will and Plea&s;ure of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, with re&s;pect to His thus dealing with Men.</HI> What&s;oever Rea|&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned for His dealing thus with them; yet it is certain that as the ca&s;e now &s;tands, GOD's doing thus is very much to be a&s;cribed to His Conde|&s;cending Grace.</P>

the other, &s;o it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that GOD ever <HI>&s;o</HI> exerci&s;eth His Soveraign Power as to act any ways contrary to Ju&s;tice or Equity. We mu&s;t remember that the object of Divine Soveraignty, is What with re&s;pect to GODs other Glorious Attributes, may be either fitly done, or not done; and it is with re&s;pect to &s;uch things as the&s;e that GOD doth in Scripture Ju&s;tifie His Actions on the Account of His Soveraign Power and Lord&s;hip: As therefore GOD by His So|veraign Power, neither does nor can act any thing Contrary to His Infinite Wi&s;dom, and Unalterable Truth; &s;o neither can nor will He by the &s;ame Power and Authority do any thing contrary to His mo&s;t perfect Ju&s;tice: And thus there appeareth a mo&s;t exact Harmony among the Divine Attributes; and herein I conceive the Holine&s;s of GOD eminently to con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>AND hence, as it is a true Propo&s;ition, That what|&s;oever GOD does is very ju&s;t and equal; &s;o it is no le&s;s true, that there are &s;ome things that are in their own Nature unju&s;t, and therefore &s;uch as GOD nei|ther can nor will do. This Truth is &s;uppo&s;ed in all tho&s;e <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezek.</HI> Chap. 18. <HI>Neh.</HI> 9.33. <HI>Job</HI> 34.10, 11, 12.</NOTE> Places of Scripture, wherein the Ju&s;tice and Equity of GOD's Dealings with His Creatures is vin|dicated, and His Care to deal Righteou&s;ly by them is a&s;&s;erted. But here poor &s;imple Men mu&s;t be very cau|tious, and not be over confident with re&s;pect to par|ticular things, either that they may be ju&s;tly done, or not, lea&s;t they Sin in charging GOD fooli&s;hly. To be &s;ure it is a good Rule, that whatever GOD does, is very Ju&s;t and Righteous, whether Men &s;ee the Equity of it, yea or no.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF GOD dealeth thus with Men, <HI>He dealeth very mercifully and kindly by them.</HI> In this not only His Ju&s;tice,
<PB N="24" REF="002152_0025_0FBC7810F55CE380">
but even his Mercy and Kindne&s;s towards Men ap|peareth. In the Condition that Mankind now are, GOD in treating of them as He does, while He is dealing with them as with Rea&s;onable Creatures, does &s;hew abundance of unde&s;erved Favour and Kindne&s;s unto them. How kindly does GOD treat Men, when He &s;peaks to them as in our Text, and the Words immediately following, <HI>Come now, and let us rea&s;on to|gether, &s;aith the Lord: Though your &s;ins be as &s;carlet, they &s;hall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crim&s;on, they &s;hall be as Wooll.</HI> Thus GOD <HI>draws Men with the bands of Love,</HI> Ho&s;. 11.4. <HI>Allures them, and &s;peaks Comfortably unto them,</HI> Chap. 2. ver. 14. He &s;wears to them, that <HI>He taketh no plea&s;ure in their Death, but on the contrary that they &s;hould turn from their own evil ways and live,</HI> Ezek. 33.11.</P>
<P>THUS kindly doth GOD deal with Men. To be &s;ure if they duely con&s;ider how He treats them, they mu&s;t acknowledge He dealeth very well by them.</P>
<P><HI>USE,</HI> II. DOES GOD deal with Men as with Rea&s;onable Creatures, <HI>Then &s;urely Men ought to deal thus with one another.</HI> If GOD, who is Infinitely Supe|riour unto the greate&s;t Men in the World, does yet not di&s;dain thus to treat them, How much more may they expect to be thus treated by tho&s;e who are <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> 27.16.</NOTE> of one Blood with them, and &s;o by Nature equal to them.</P>
<P>MAN-kind was not made to be Goverened by meer force and violence and driven <HI>to</HI> and <HI>fro,</HI> as tho&s;e In|feriour Creatures were that were put in Subjection to them. GOD Him&s;elf does not &s;o Exerci&s;e His Au|thority over them; He con&s;iders and deals by them as MEN, and would have them know them&s;elves &s;o to be, and expect to be dealt with accordingly, and would
<PB N="25" REF="002152_0026_0FBC781499831CD8">
have others al&s;o ob&s;erve it, in order to their treating of them in &s;uch a manner as is &s;uitable to &s;o noble a Species of Being as they are.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to this we find that tho' <HI>I&s;rael</HI> be Metaphorically &s;poken of as a Flock of Sheep under Shepherds, unto who&s;e care they were committed, <HI>Ezek.</HI> Chap. 34. Yet they were in the clo&s;e of that Chapter, by GOD put in mind of what they really were, Ver&s;. 31. <HI>And ye my Flock, the Flock of my Pa&s;ture, are Men, and I am your God, &s;aith the Lord God.</HI> If GOD's Flock be <HI>Men,</HI> their Shepherds ought to carry it to|wards them accordingly, by treating them as Rea&s;o|nable Creatures <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.3</NOTE> <HI>Not lording of it over them</HI>; but &s;hew|ing them their Duty, and by who&s;e Authority they are called to it, and what Obligations they are under to perform it. The&s;e &s;hould therefore be Men able to render a Rea&s;on, and by &s;olid Arguments, to prove what they &s;ay, and to <HI>Convince gain-&s;ayers</HI>; for if Men's Rea&s;on and Con&s;ciences be not convinced, all the Cur|&s;es denounced from <HI>Mount-Ehal,</HI> will avail very little to oblige them to their Duty, nor will External force and compul&s;ion, if u&s;ed, make any good Impre&s;&s;ions on them. Mini&s;ters therefore who treat with Men in GOD's Name &s;hould, like <HI>Paul,</HI> Rea&s;on about the Things of which they Di&s;cour&s;e, He <HI>Rea&s;oned of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, Temperance, and Judgment to come,</HI> and <HI>Faelia trembled,</HI> Acts 24.25. And this &s;eems to have been <HI>Paul</HI>'s ordinary way, Acts 17.2. <HI>And Paul as his man|ner was, went in unto them, &amp; three Sabbath Days Rea&s;oned with them out of the Scriptures.</HI> This cour&s;e al&s;o <HI>Samuel</HI> took with <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> 1 Sam. 12.6, 7. He <HI>&s;aid unto them, &mdash; Stand &s;till, that I may Rea&s;on with you before the Lord.</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P><HI>USE,</HI> III. DOES GOD deal with Men as with Rea&s;onable Creatures, <HI>Then &s;urely Men &s;hould take heed
<PB N="26" REF="002152_0027_0FBC78157A2EB6E0">
of every thing, which tendeth to render them uncapable of be|ing thus treated, with Advantage or Succe&s;s.</HI> As GOD made us Rational Creatures; &s;o He conde&s;cends to Rea&s;on and Argue with us, about things that are of the greate&s;t importance and concernment to us; He is willing that Rea&s;on &s;hould decide every ca&s;e wherein He has to do with us: And if there be any matters of Controver&s;y betwixt Him and us, He invites us to argue with Him upon them, and gives us leave to <HI>bring forth our strong Rea&s;ons,</HI> if we have any &s;uch, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 41.21.</P>
<P>AND are Men thus called to argue the Ca&s;e with GOD, to hear Rea&s;on from Him, and to give good and wi&s;e An&s;wers unto Him; &s;urely they had need be well prepared for this, that in the things wherein they have to do with &s;o wi&s;e and holy a Being as He is, they may behave them&s;elves as becomes Rational and Intelligent Beings, and not di&s;honour them&s;elves by a carriage unworthy of the Character which they bear, and of the Honour that GOD is plea&s;ed to put upon them, in treating of them as He does; and they had need take &s;pecial heed of every thing that tends to unfit them for behaving them&s;elves well, when they are called to Rea&s;on with Him.</P>
<P>AND I &s;hall here mention <HI>Three Things</HI> which Peo|ple had need on this account, take great heed of, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GROSS Ignorance.</HI> This exceedingly unfits Per|&s;ons for being treated as Rea&s;onable Creatures with Advantage. I &s;peak here of &s;uch Ignorance as is op|po&s;ed unto Knowledge, that may be acquired by an Indu&s;trious u&s;e of means. Tho' Per&s;ons have never &s;o good natural Parts, yet if they are gro&s;ly Igno|rant, how exceedingly does this unfit them both for under&s;tanding Rea&s;on them&s;elves, and &s;peaking Rea&s;on
<PB N="27" REF="002152_0028_0FBC7816F4E78C70">
unto others. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Wad&s;worth</HI>'s Preface to his Expo&s;ition on the A&s;&s;emblies Catechi&s;m, <HI>p.</HI> 4.</NOTE> Thus there are many who for want of common Learning, can hardly under&s;tand the Language in which People ordinarily &s;peak; and to be &s;ure are far from under&s;tanding much of the Language where|in GOD in the Scriptures &s;peaks to them. Such Words as Ju&s;tification, Adoption and Regeneration are hard Words to them; and they have little benefit by the plaine&s;t Sermons, becau&s;e they cannot under&s;tand them.</P>
<P>NOW how mi&s;erably qualified are &s;uch is the&s;e, to be treated in a Rational way, about things that have any difficulty in them Per&s;ons &s;hould take care that they may be more capable of under&s;tanding what GOD &s;ays to them, and the force of the Arguments He u&s;eth with them; and Heads of Families &s;hould take care that their Children and Servants, may not want tho&s;e In&s;tructions that are nece&s;&s;ary unto this end.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>STRONG Prejudices.</HI> The&s;e do al&s;o exceedingly un|fit Men for being treated in a Rational way, to any good Purpo&s;e, either by GOD or Men. When GOD dealeth with Men as with Rea&s;onable Creatures, He doubtle&s;s would have them u&s;e their Rea&s;on very free|ly, and put forth the Powers of their Souls unto the utmo&s;t, in weighing and examining the things pro|po&s;ed to them, to be con&s;idered by them, and GOD &s;ays nothing to Men, but what will bear the &s;tricte&s;t Examination and Trial.</P>
<P>BUT now if Men &s;uffer their Judgments to be fore|&s;talled, and their Minds prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with Prejudices, again&s;t the things that GOD would per&s;wade them unto, they do hereby render them&s;elves exceeding un|fit for &s;uch a Treaty as GOD is &s;eeking to manage with them; and when it is thus, the plaine&s;t and
<PB N="28" REF="002152_0029_0FBC781BF1DC9E30">
mo&s;t forceable Rea&s;ons and Motives will have very little Influence upon them. Thus when Men's Minds are filled with Prejudices again&s;t Religion and Godli|ne&s;s, and the Idols of Sin and the World are &s;et up in their Hearts, if they be urged with the &s;tronge&s;t Arguments to for&s;ake tho&s;e, and live Religiou&s;ly; they will be ready to &s;ay with tho&s;e in Jer. 2.25. <HI>No, for we have loved &s;trangers, and after them we will go.</HI> They cannot now <HI>Hearken to the voice of the charmers, charming never &s;o wi&s;ely,</HI> P&s;al. 58.5.</P>
<P>I SHALL mention one thing more, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>DRUNKENNESS.</HI> How evidently does this unfit &s;uch as are addicted to it, for being treated as Per&s;ons that can u&s;e their Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding well? How unfit are Drunken Men to be argued withal as with Rea&s;onable Creatures? Such as are actually Drunk are indeed more like Bea&s;ts then Men. <HI>They are like the Hor&s;e and Mule that have no under&s;tanding,</HI> P&s;al. 32.9. Nay rather like &s;ome other Bea&s;ts, with which wicked Men are compared in Scripture, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.22. When Per&s;ons are Drunk, they are unfit to be treated by Men in a Rational way, about the Affairs of this Life; and how much more unfit are they to be treated by the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD, about the Affairs of their Immortal Souls, and the Eternal World? Can we think Drunken Men fit to be &s;poken unto by a Wi&s;e and Holy GOD, as GOD &s;peaks to Men in our Text, <HI>Come now, and let us Rea&s;on together, &s;aith the Lord</HI>? No truely, they are very far from it. Yet &s;ome that are given to Drunkenne&s;s are &s;carce ever willing to Di&s;cour&s;e about the things of GOD and their Souls, but when they are Drunk, and &s;o utterly unfit to be treated about them.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all; for tho&s;e that do frequently inflame and intoxicate them&s;elves with Strong Drink,
<PB N="29" REF="002152_0030_0FBC781D1B2D6D90">
do generally, if not always &s;o &s;tepify their Sen&s;es, and impair their Under&s;tandings by it (though they them&s;elves know it not,) as almo&s;t to unfit them|&s;elves to be treated as Rational Creatures at any Time.</P>
<P>LET therefore &s;uch as <HI>Ri&s;e up early in the Morning, that they may follow after Strong-Drink, and continue until Night, till Wine inflame them,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;a.</HI> 5.11.</NOTE> &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, when they are in &s;uch a condition as to be capable of it, how much wor&s;e than Bruits they are frequently making them&s;elves; and how much it concerns them to Reform their Lives, before they &s;o far lo&s;e the u&s;e of their Under&s;tandings, as to be uncapable of receiving any Benefit by tho&s;e Rational Methods, which GOD is &s;till making u&s;e of with them.</P>
<P><HI>USE,</HI> IV. DOES GOD deal with Men as with Rea&s;onable Creatures, <HI>Then ought Men to take great care to carry them&s;elves as Rea&s;onable Creatures ought to do, towards GOD, that &s;o in the Things wherein they have to do with Him, He may have no ju&s;t Rea&s;on to blame or condemn them.</HI> Since GOD is plea&s;ed to deal with Men as with Rational Creatures, certainly Men &s;hould &s;ee to it, that they carry them&s;elves &s;o, that Rea&s;on will ju&s;tify them, whenever GOD &s;hall call them to give an Account of their Actions, or &s;hall enter into a Debate with them about them.</P>
<P>WE are always accountable unto GOD, for what we do; and He has many wayes to bring the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of our Actions into Tryal. In His Word He deals with us about them. Our Con|&s;ciences are His Vicegerents to Judge of them, and to Ju&s;tifie or condemn them. There are Men Au|thorized by Him to examine as with re&s;pect to many
<PB N="30" REF="002152_0031_0FBC781EDBA15D40">
of them. There will be a Great and General Day of Judgment, wherein we mu&s;t give an Account of all of them, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.10. <HI>Eccl.</HI> 12.14. GQD will &s;hortly call us to an Account as Rea&s;onable Crea|tures, how we have behaved our &s;elves in the World, He will bring us to a fair Tryal, that it may appear whether we can by Rea&s;on ju&s;tifie our Actions and Carriages, or not. It mu&s;t therefore needs greatly concern us to &s;ee to it, that our Ca&s;e be good when GOD calls us to an&s;wer for our &s;elves. We had need therefore &s;ay and re&s;olve as in Hab 2 1. unto which I may here allude, <HI>I will &s;tand upon my watch, and will &s;et me upon the Tower, and will watch to &s;ee what he will &s;ay unto me, and what I &s;hall an&s;wer when I am re|proved,</HI> Or, as it is in the Margin, <HI>argued withal.</HI></P>
<P>INASMUCH al&s;o as GOD puts a great Honour and Re&s;pect upon Men, in His treating of them as Rea&s;o|nable Creatures, and deals very kindly by them; how vile a thing will it then be in Men, if they carry them&s;elves unrea&s;onably and bruiti&s;hly towards Him. How fitly may GOD &s;ay unto Them, as in I&s;a. 46.8. <HI>Shew your &s;elves Men.</HI> GOD ju&s;tly expects that we &s;hould behave our &s;elves &s;uitably to the dignity of our Natures, and to the honourable Way of His treating of us, and how ba&s;e and unworthy &s;hall we &s;hew our &s;elves, if our carriage and deportment towards Him be wholly Unan&s;werable to His dealings with us, and expectations concerning us? GOD ju&s;tly complains of Men, when they carry it not towards Him as Rea&s;onable Creatures ought to do, Jer. 4.22. <HI>My People are fooli&s;h, they have not known me, they are &s;otti&s;h Children and have none Under&s;tanding, they are wi&s;e to do evil, but to do good they have no Knowledge.</HI> And Jer. 8.7. <HI>The Stork in the Heavens knoweth her appointed times, and the Turtle and the Crane and the Swallow, ob&s;erve the Time of their coming; but my People know not the Judgment of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="002152_0032_0FBC7823A0CBB8B0">IT is then highly nece&s;&s;ary, that we do endeavour in all points to behave our &s;elves towards a Wi&s;e and Holy GOD, as does become Rea&s;onable Crea|tures; and tho&s;e that are by Him treated as &s;uch, to do: And as &s;uch we are Obliged wi&s;ely to con&s;ider &s;uch things as the&s;e, and thus to Argue with our &s;elves.</P>
<P>HAVE we not Rea&s;on to believe that there is an Eternal GOD of Infinite Perfections, who has Cre|ated the World, and all things therein? How el&s;e came all the&s;e Things, which we behold, by their Being?</P>
<P>HAVE we not Rea&s;on to believe that GOD made Rea&s;onable Creatures, to render unto Him a Rea&s;ona|ble Service? Such as He made them capable of, and that He would therefore, &s;ome way or other make known His Mind and Will to them?</P>
<P>HAVE we not Rea&s;on to believe that the Scriptures are of Divine Original? Or were given by In&s;piration of GOD, to direct Rea&s;onable Creatures in their Duty towards Him? Is there not the &s;tamp of His Autho|rity upon them? Are they not worthy of &s;uch a One as He is, and every way &s;uitable to &s;uch an End, as to teach Men how they may Glorify GOD, and come to the Enjoyment of Him?</P>
<P>IS there not good Rea&s;on that Men &s;hould firmly believe all that GOD does in the Scriptures &s;ay unto them; yea, tho' they cannot comprehend &s;ome of the My&s;teries therein delivered? And is not their Sin great, if they make Him a Lyar, by not believing what He &s;peaks, and te&s;tifies unto them?</P>
<P>IS it not good Rea&s;on that we &s;hould Obey the Laws of the Great <HI>JEHOVAH,</HI> which are in His Word given unto us? Or &s;hould not He that Made
<PB N="32" REF="002152_0033_0FBC78247A8D0380">
us, and Continually Keeps us, al&s;o Rule and Govern us?</P>
<P>HAVE we not abundant Rea&s;on to acknowledge that Mankind have fallen from GOD by Sinning a|gain&s;t Him, and &s;o become ju&s;tly liable to innumera|ble, and endle&s;s Mi&s;eries?</P>
<P>HAVE we not Rea&s;on to believe the Record that GOD has, in the Go&s;pel, given of His SON? Should we not look upon it as <HI>a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the World to &s;ave Sinners?</HI> 1 Tim. 1.15.</P>
<P>HAVE we not Rea&s;on to E&s;teem the Terms of Peace propounded in the Go&s;pel, as very Rea&s;onable, and very Gracious? Or have we the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to think that GOD dealeth hardly with us, in holding us unto &s;uch Terms? This is the ca&s;e that GOD invites Men to Rea&s;on with Him about in the Text, as by the Con|text does appear.</P>
<P>IS it not a mo&s;t Rea&s;onable thing, that Sinners &s;hould &s;incerely Repent of their many Sins again&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, and turn to Him from them with all their Hearts and Souls; and that they &s;hould wil|lingly accept the Terms of Peace offered to them thro' a Redeemer? And is not their folly exceeding great, if they refu&s;e thus to do?</P>
<P>FINALLY, Have we not good Rea&s;on to acknow|ledge, that if Men di&s;obey and di&s;honour the Great GOD; if they de&s;pi&s;e His Authority, and will not hearken to His Voice; if they will reject His Mercy, and not believe in His Son; but trample His pre|cious Blood under foot, and utterly refu&s;e that He &s;hould Rule over them.

<P><PB N="2" REF="002152_0037_0FBC782CB86531E0">Concerning the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Indians</HI> on the&s;e I&s;lands, and places adjacent on the Main, there was a brief Narrative written by <HI>Matthew Mayhew,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Elde&s;t Son of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Thomas Mayhew,</HI> who fir&s;t Preached the Go&s;pel unto them; which Narrative was Printed at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in the Year 1694. and Re|printed at <HI>London</HI> the next Year, under the Title of, <HI>The Conque&s;ts and Triumphs of Grace,</HI> &amp;c. The &s;ame, for Sub&s;tance, being again Printed &s;ome Years after, in Dr. <HI>C. Mather's</HI> Hi&s;tory of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall begin my Account of the State of the <HI>Indians</HI> from the time the &s;aid Book was fir&s;t Publi&s;hed, that being about the time that I fir&s;t began to Preach to them.</P>
<P>The Number of <HI>Indians</HI> on the&s;e I&s;lands is very much dimini&s;hed, &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fir&s;t &s;ettled on <HI>Martha's-Vineyard,</HI> which was in the Year 1642 there being then as was &s;uppo&s;ed on that I&s;land about 1500 Souls. At pre&s;ent there are in the <HI>Vineyard</HI> &s;ix &s;mall Villages, contain|ing in all of them, about 155 Families, and the Number of Souls may be about eight hundred.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e Villages is provided with an <HI>Indian</HI> Preacher to di&s;pence the Word to them on the Lord's Days, when I am not with them. They meet for the Wor&s;hip of GOD twice a Day on the Sabbath, and after Prayer, &s;ing a P&s;alm; then there is a Sermon Preached on
<PB N="3" REF="002152_0038_0FBC782E417B2680">
&s;ome Portion of Scripture, which being ended&punc; they &s;ing again; while the Days be of a &s;uffi|cient length; and then conclude with Prayer.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the <HI>Indians</HI> on the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> there is a &s;mall A&s;&s;embly on <HI>Winthrop's</HI> I&s;land, the Ea&s;termo&s;t of <HI>El&s;abeth's</HI> I&s;lands before men|tioned; and the&s;e al&s;o have ordinarily an In|dian Mini&s;ter to Preach the Word of GOD to them, and Mr. <HI>John Weeks</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> for|merly Preached to them; but has lately, as I am informed, de&s;i&s;ted from that Work.</P>
<P>At <HI>Tucker's</HI>-I&s;land, &amp; at <HI>Na&s;haun</HI> or <HI>Slocum's</HI> I&s;land, which lie near together, We&s;tward of <HI>Winthrop's</HI> I&s;land, are about 12 or 14 Families, and the&s;e, tho' their Number be &s;mall, are provided with an Indian Preacher.</P>
<P>At the before mentioned <HI>No-mans-land,</HI> there are now &s;o few Indians left, that they have none to Preach con&s;tantly to them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the <HI>Indian A&s;&s;emblies</HI> already men|tioned, there is one A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> at the <HI>Gayhead</HI>; but the number of People belong|ing unto this, is very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Tho' there are many <HI>Indians</HI> on the&s;e I&s;lands, who are very negligent as to their Attendance on the Publick Wor&s;hip of GOD; yet I know of none, but what do make &s;ome Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, and will talk &s;oberly, when treated withal about it; having made a trial on &s;ome that have been mo&s;t &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002152_0039_0FBC782FB552BDD8">And tho' there are among the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> a great many who are very defective in their Morals; yet there are a con&s;iderable number, even of tho&s;e not yet joyned in Church Com|munion, who live &s;oberly, and Wor&s;hip GOD in their Families.</P>
<P>There has, from time to time, been much care taken that the &s;everal Villages might be provided with School-Ma&s;ters to teach the Children to Read and Write; yet &s;ome of them have not been &s;o con&s;tantly &s;upplied, as is to be de&s;ired; and generally when the Spring of the Year comes on, the Indians take their Chil|dren from School, alleging they want them for Tillage of the Land; and &s;o the Schools fail till the Fall; and this has much hindred their Progre&s;s in Learning: Neverthele&s;s, I think the greate&s;t number can Read, either in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or in the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue; and &s;ome in both.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o care taken to <HI>Catechi&s;e</HI> the Youth, For be&s;ides what is done in this kind, by the <HI>Indian</HI> School-Ma&s;ters &amp; Preachers, I frequent|ly examine the Young People my &s;elf, and have determined to attend this Service once a Fort|night, in &s;ome or other of the forementioned Villages; and this Method will I hope, prove very advantageous, many grown People as well as Children, attending the&s;e Exerci&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002152_0040_0FBC78339798DCF0">The <HI>Indian</HI> Church at <HI>Martha's-Vineyard,</HI> whereof Mr. <HI>Japheth Hannit</HI> an excellent <HI>In|dian Mini&s;ter</HI> was formerly the Pa&s;tor, but died in the Year 1712. had after his Death another Pa&s;tor, called <HI>Sowomog</HI>: but he being an Old Man when he was fir&s;t called unto that Office, lived but a very few Years.</P>
<P>The Name of the pre&s;ent Pa&s;tor of that Church is <HI>Joa&s;h Panu,</HI> who is a very &s;erious prudent &amp; pious Man, of a good Conver&s;ation, and one who drinks no &s;trong drink, but is much grieved at tho&s;e of his Country-men who do err by means of it. If it plea&s;e GOD to continue his Life, he is like to prove a good In&s;trument; but being lately fallen in|to a Langui&s;hing Di&s;temper, I fear what the i&s;&s;ue of it may be.</P>
<P>The number of Communicants, both Men and Women, in this Church, is about 110. the mo&s;t of the&s;e are Inhabitants of <HI>Martha's-Vineyard,</HI> but not all; there being a few that have joyned them&s;elves there unto, not only from <HI>El&s;abeth</HI>'s I&s;lands, but from the Main Land al&s;o, lying next unto the <HI>Vineyard.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord's Supper is ordinarily Admini|&s;tred in that Church about 7 or 8 times in a Year, and Di&s;cipline is in &s;ome mea&s;ure kept up in it. Unto this End, be&s;ides other Church Meetings, there is con&s;tantly on the <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> or <HI>Friday</HI> before that Sacrament is Admini|&s;tred,
<PB N="6" REF="002152_0041_0FBC78359312EB58">
a Meeting of the Church, wherein &s;uch are &s;u&s;pended from the Lords Table as having been over-taken in any fault, have not given due &s;atisfaction. At this Meeting al&s;o there is ordinarily a Sermon Preached &s;uita|ble to the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged that as the <HI>Indi|ans</HI> are many of them much addicted unto &s;trong drink; &s;o &s;ome of the Members of the Indian Church have been &s;ometimes found very faulty, on this account; yet it is al&s;o true, that &s;uch as the&s;e have generally ap|peared very Penitent. And tho' &s;ome have fallen quite away, and &s;o have been cut off by the Sword of Di&s;cipline; yet others thro' the Grace of GOD, have been &s;o far recove|red out of the Sins into which they have fallen, as that it may be hoped they will not again return to them; and there have all along been, and &s;till are, a con&s;iderable num|ber, who&s;e Conver&s;ation is, &s;o far as I can un|der&s;tand, very blamele&s;s, and who may be ju&s;tly looked upon as Exemplary Chri&s;tians; what ever &s;uch <HI>Engli&s;h Men</HI> as are filled with Prejudices again&s;t the <HI>Indians,</HI> may &s;ay to the contrary.</P>
<P>Some Years after I fir&s;t began to Preach to the <HI>Indians,</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> on <HI>Martha's-Vineyard,</HI> did on a day of <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> appointed for that End, &s;olemnly renew their Covenant
<PB N="7" REF="002152_0042_0FBC7836A8D13FD0">
with GOD, engaging to endeavour to for&s;ake tho&s;e Sins with which they confe&s;&s;ed they were too ea&s;ily be&s;et; and there was after this, for a Time, &s;ome Reformation: but I ob&s;erved that two or three of the Brethren that could not be per&s;waded to joyn in the Action, &s;oon after fell into Scandalous Mi&s;|demeanours.</P>
<P>I al&s;o ob&s;erved, That after the Church had thus renewed their Covenant, the Means of Grace offered unto the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;eemed for a time to be attended with more of the Pre|&s;ence of GOD, and the Influences of His Spi|rit, than they were before, or have been &s;ince.</P>
<P>It was then frequent to &s;ee Per&s;ons at the Hearing of Sermons, very much affected, and &s;ome times as &s;oon as Sermon was ended, there would &s;tand up &s;everal, one after ano|ther, and make very Penitential Confe&s;&s;ions of their Sins, with Promi&s;es to endeavour to Live new Lives, de&s;iring al&s;o the Prayers of the People of GOD for them.</P>
<P>About this time there joyned in full Com|munion unto that &s;mall Church on the <HI>Vine|yard,</HI> in one Year, at lea&s;t 30 Per&s;ons, the be|havour of many of whom did very much re|&s;emble that of the Jailor, at his Conver&s;ion, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. GOD &s;hewing us herein that He can make the <HI>Indians</HI> as well as Others a <HI>willing People in the Day of His Power.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002152_0043_0FBC7837F4CAE098">There is an Increa&s;e of Knowledge among the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that their progre&s;s herein is but &s;low, by rea&s;on of the want of a Learned Mini&s;try con&s;tantly to In&s;truct them. Their ordinary Preachers ha|ving but little Learning, are not &s;o able to feed them with Knowledge and Under&s;tand|ing as is to be de&s;ired; yet &s;ome of the&s;e have Gifts not to be de&s;pi&s;ed in <HI>a day of &s;mall things.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Mini&s;ters as they are Mem|bers in full Communion of the Church on the <HI>Vineyard,</HI> &s;o they do not engage in the work of the Mini&s;try without the Con&s;ent &amp; Ap|probation of that Church, as well as of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters that Preach unto the Indi|ans, and have an In&s;pection over them.</P>
<P>Having now Preached to the <HI>Indians</HI> up|ward of Twenty-five Years, I have never yet had any &s;pecial charge of any one &s;ingle Con|gregation committed to me; but have vi&s;ited the &s;everal fore-mentioned A&s;&s;emblies alter|nately, as I have thought mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary; Preaching ordinarily, unto &s;ome or other of them every Lord's Day, and on working days once a Fortnight; con&s;tantly al&s;o attending their Church-Meetings, to a&s;&s;i&s;t &amp; direct them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> when they are Sick, generally &s;end for their Mini&s;ters, and &s;ome times other Chri&s;tians with them, to vi&s;it them and Pray with, and for them. I have &s;ome times
<PB N="9" REF="002152_0044_0FBC783BA0EA6828">
been with them on &s;uch occa&s;ions, and heard them profe&s;s a great concern about their Souls; declaring that they did not regard any thing in this World, &s;o they might ob|tain an Intere&s;t in GOD's Favour; and I have known many of them who have profe&s;&s;ed a good hope thro' CHRIST in their Death, and who have behaved them&s;elves on all accounts as does become dying Saints; nor have I any doubt, but that many of them have died in the Lord.</P>
<P>The Reverend Mr. <HI>Jo&s;iah Torrey,</HI> Pa&s;tor of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church in <HI>Ti&s;bury</HI> on the <HI>Vine|yard</HI> has al&s;o for many Years pa&s;t Preached as a Lecturer unto the <HI>Indians</HI> on that I&s;land, having for that End learned their Language. He Preacheth in &s;ome or other of their A&s;|&s;emblies once a Fortnight, and goes frequent|ly to their Church-Meetings, to advi&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t them; &s;o that the <HI>Indians</HI> have a Ser|mon every <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Preached to them, either by Mr. <HI>Torrey,</HI> or my &s;elf: And we &s;trengthen the hands of one another, by going together to the&s;e Weekly Exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>The Reverend Mr. <HI>Samuel Wi&s;wall</HI> Pa&s;tor of the Church in <HI>Edgartown,</HI> has al&s;o now almo&s;t learned the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue, with a de&s;ign to do what Service he can among that People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> on <HI>Martha's Vineyard</HI> and the adjacent I&s;lands, do hitherto under&s;tand the
<PB N="10" REF="002152_0045_0FBC783E089762F8">
<HI>Indian</HI> Tongue much better than that of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; and therefore complain much for want of <HI>Indian</HI> BIBLES, having now but very few among them. Nor are there any to be had; the la&s;t Edition being now gone. The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> are therefore very de&s;irous of another Impre&s;&s;ion of the Bible, if it might be obtained; and divers of them have told me, as well as &s;ome of tho&s;e on <HI>Nantucket,</HI> (whom I have divers times vi&s;ited) that they &s;hould be willing according to their capaci|ty, to contribute to it.</P>
<P>But the di&s;advantage which the <HI>Indians</HI> are under thro' the Scarcity of BIBLES is &s;ome-what helped by the Care of the Ho|nourable Commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;upply them with other u&s;eful Books in their own Lan|guage, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>New-England</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith; Several Catechi&s;ms; The Practice of Piety; Mr. <HI>Shepard's</HI> Sincere Convert; Mr. <HI>Baxter's</HI> Call to the Unconverted. And &s;eve|ral Sermon Books of Dr. <HI>Mather</HI>'s, &amp;c. be&s;ides the P&s;alter, and the Go&s;pel of JOHN, Prin|ted in the Year 1709. And the <HI>Indian</HI> Primer Printed this Year, in <HI>Indian</HI> &amp; <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> All which Books are now very u&s;eful unto them.</P>
<P>As to their Civil Government, the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Dukes</HI> County, (as well as in other Places) are wholly under the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>;
