<Q><BIBL>1 SAMUEL XXV.1.</BIBL> AND SAMUEL died, and all the I&s;raelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his hou&s;e at Ramah&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WOULD to God (if I may &s;o ex|pre&s;s my&s;elf without &s;eeming to blame the &s;overeign will and wi&s;dom) Would to God, I had not &s;o melancholy an occa&s;ion as I have, to de|&s;i&s;t at pre&s;ent from the pro&s;ecution of that important &s;ubject, on which I have for &s;ome time been di&s;cour&s;ing! But God, who
<PB N="6" REF="008666_0004_102fac88e3f3c7f8">
doeth his will in the armies of heaven, and among&s;t the inhabitants of the earth, hath, in his holy and in&s;crutable provi|dence, given me this occa&s;ion, by the death of an honorable per&s;on lately be|longing to this &s;ociety. And altho' I have ever had, rather an aver&s;ion to, than any fondne&s;s for, the common practice of making long encomiums on the dead, con|&s;idering how often they are pro&s;tituted, &s;o as to pa&s;s with many people, even when they happen to be ju&s;t, for little or nothing more than words of cour&s;e; yet I thought you would hardly excu&s;e me, and, indeed, I could not ea&s;ily excu&s;e my&s;elf, if I neglected to take a particular notice of the life and death of &s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;hed a per&s;on as Judge SEWALL; or did not endeavour to lead you into &s;ome pro|per reflections on this di&s;pen&s;ation of di|vine providence. But in truth, tho' I know not well how to be &s;ilent on this occa&s;ion; yet, on the other hand, I am &s;o deeply touch'd, &s;o penetrated hereby, that I hardly know how to &s;peak &mdash; For alas! one, indeed the far better part of my heart, &s;eems torn away from me, while the other is left wounded, panting and bleeding. So that if my di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould appear broken and unconnected, your can|dor
<PB N="7" REF="008666_0005_102fac8b84b1d3f8">
will, I hope, &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome apology for me. Whatever I &s;hall &s;ay of this excel|lent per&s;on's character, will be the genuine dictate of my heart, not the fruit of &s;tudy or invention; for &s;orrow, you know, does not aim much at being <HI>correct,</HI> or <HI>methodical.</HI></P>
<P>I had indeed rea&s;on to love and honor him as my father; tho', &s;o great was the humility and conde&s;cention of that good man, that had I even call'd him my friend, or brother, I believe he would &s;carcely have been offended at it. And it would be a ju&s;t and great reproach to me, if I did not now &s;incerely love and honor his memory; and &s;hew &s;ome public re&s;pect to it; e&s;pecially &s;ince the doing this, by recollecting &s;ome of his many good quali|ties, may be a means of exciting us all to imitate his virtues. And &s;ince the mouth &s;peaketh out of, and according to, "the abundance that is in the heart;" I mu&s;t, in ju&s;tice, forewarn you that my di&s;cour&s;e on this occa&s;ion, unle&s;s my &s;pirits and &s;trength &s;hould quite fail me, will be con|&s;iderably longer than it is u&s;ual for me to be. But amid&s;t all my &s;orrow, and great heavine&s;s of heart, I &s;hall have at lea&s;t one con&s;olation; that of a&s;&s;uring my&s;elf, as I go along, that whatever, almo&s;t, I may
<PB N="8" REF="008666_0006_102fac8f36f2c9a8">
&s;ay in honor of this excellent man, none of my auditors will think me exce&s;&s;ive in his eulogium; but heartily join with me in paying this public regard to his memo|ry; which will be &s;ome alleviation of my grief.</P>
<P>And, as an introduction to the de&s;ign which has been mentioned, of making &s;ome reflections on the life, character and death of the worthy per&s;on lately deceas'd; it &s;eems not ami&s;s to make a few ob&s;ervati|ons on the life, character and death of SAMUEL, many years the chief judge and magi&s;trate of I&s;rael; one of the mo&s;t ex|cellent characters which we meet with among&s;t tho&s;e of the ancient worthies; and therefore, as it is conceived, the more &s;uitable to introduce what is propo&s;ed as the main bu&s;ine&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>It is not de&s;igned, however, either to give a large, and very particular account of SA|MUEL, or to labour a parallel between the&s;e two judges: but only to &s;elect &s;uch parts of the conduct and character of the former of them, as &s;eem directly pertinent to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; or at lea&s;t, &s;uch as may ea&s;ily be accommodated thereto.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="008666_0007_102fac91dec12370">We have, in effect, a very honorable te&s;timony to the worthine&s;s of SAMUEL's character, in that pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred hi&s;tory, on which my di&s;cour&s;e is grounded; altho' nothing is &s;aid therein, directly, or parti|cularly concerning it. When he died, "<HI>all the I&s;raelites</HI> were gathered together, and <HI>lamented</HI> him"; attending his funeral rites with the greate&s;t demon&s;trations of grief. The unfeigned tears of an whole people, collected together to &s;olemnize the burial of a per&s;on of his rank and &s;tation, are a &s;trong evidence of his &s;uperior merit. Eulogiums falling thus from the eyes of a whole people, (if I may &s;o expre&s;s it) falling in unbidden tears; or bur&s;ting from the heart in involuntary &s;ighs; are louder, and more authentic te&s;timonies of real worth in the per&s;on, who is the occa&s;ion of them, than the labour'd prai&s;es of a thou&s;and tongues, however eloquent. Such tears, &s;uch &s;ighs, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, reveal the real &s;entiments of the &s;oul; while a great pomp of words often &s;erves to no other purpo&s;e, than to contradict, or di&s;gui&s;e, them. Thus it was that SAMUEL was prai&s;ed when he died; the&s;e were the panegyrics which all I&s;rael be&s;tow'd on him; or rather, which the remembrance of his virtues, in conjunction with the &s;ad
<PB N="10" REF="008666_0008_102fac9373a87108">
&s;pectacle of his venerable remains before their eyes, extorted from them.</P>
<P>But we need not be implicit believers in groans and tears, even in tho&s;e of an whole nation. For if we look into the hi&s;tory of SAMUEL, we &s;hall ea&s;ily di&s;cover the grounds of them; and &s;ee how naturally and ju&s;tly, as well as copiou&s;ly, they bur&s;t forth on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>We have a particular account of SA|MUEL's birth, and &s;ome extraordinary cir|cum&s;tances which both preceeded and fol|lowed it, in the fir&s;t chapter of the fir&s;t book, which goes under the name of that eminent per&s;on. But tho&s;e things are here pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence, as not material, or indeed pertinent, all of them, to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. It is intimated to us in the &s;econd chapter of that book, how early SAMUEL di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, or rather, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by God; and pointed out as a per&s;on, from whom great things were to be expected in due time. For it is &s;aid, <Q>the <HI>child</HI> SAMUEL grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and al&s;o with men.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 26.</NOTE> And in the beginning of the third chapter, we
<PB N="11" REF="008666_0009_102fac973508cc28">
read of <Q>the <HI>child</HI> SAMUEL's mini&s;tring unto the Lord before Eli</Q> the prie&s;t. So that, even in his tender age, he was a &s;ervant and mini&s;ter of the Lord; who &s;oon after called him to, and honored him with, the &s;acred office of a prophet. And it is ob&s;erved of him, towards the latter end of the la&s;t-mentioned chapter, that he <Q>grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>It will not be impertinent to ob&s;erve here, that in the time of SAMUEL, there were in I&s;rael certain academies, or col|leges, u&s;ually called the &s;chools of the &s;ons of the prophets; becau&s;e under the immediate direction and government of the prophets. In the&s;e, youth were in|&s;tructed in u&s;eful learning, e&s;pecially in the knowledge of God's law; and from among&s;t them, God u&s;ually rai&s;ed up, and cho&s;e the prophets, which he &s;ent to his people I&s;rael. Nor is there any rea&s;on to doubt, but that SAMUEL had his edu|cation in one of the&s;e &s;chools. For one of them, named <HI>Naioth,</HI> was in the city of Ramah,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. 1 Sam. XIX.19, 22, and 23.</NOTE> the place of SAMUEL's birth, where his father lived, where he him&s;elf
<PB N="12" REF="008666_0010_102fac99d8ee6a70">
was brought up from a child, where his own hou&s;e was afterwards, where he com|monly lived, and where he was buried. And we are particularly informed, [1 Sam. XIX chap.] that during the troubles, and public commotions, occa&s;ioned by Saul's per&s;ecuting David, Saul's me&s;&s;engers being &s;ent in pur&s;uit of David to <HI>Naioth,</HI> <Q>&s;aw the company of the prophets prophe&s;y|ing, and SAMUEL &s;tanding as <HI>appointed over them;</HI></Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 20.</NOTE> he being at this time ad|vanced in years. Now, con&s;idering the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e days, and that <HI>Naioth,</HI> that truly <HI>illu&s;trious &s;chool,</HI> was in Ramah, where SAMUEL was born and brought up; and that he was afterwards him&s;elf appointed an in&s;tructor and governor therein; there &s;eems to be no room to doubt, but that he had his education in it in his youth; tho' I do not remember, indeed, that this is any where particularly a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>But to return: After SAMUEL had been &s;ome time cloathed with the &s;acred character of a prophet, when he was about thirty or forty years of age, he was inve&s;|ted with an high civil office; that of judge, or the chief magi&s;trate in I&s;rael. For in tho&s;e days, before the introduction of mo|narchical
<PB N="13" REF="008666_0011_102fac9c79fc1208">
government, the &s;upreme civil ruler in I&s;rael was &s;tiled a judge, or the judge. In the execution of which office, SAMUEL u&s;ed to travel from one part of the country to another, holding his courts, and di&s;tributing ju&s;tice to the people, in the mo&s;t convenient places; and then returning to Ramah: which, even in tho&s;e days, was called going in "circuit". Of the&s;e facts we are informed 1 Sam. chap. VII. <HI>Viz.</HI> that SAMUEL <Q>went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh; and judged I&s;rael in all tho&s;e places. And his return was to Ramah; for there was his hou&s;e: and there he built an al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> unto the Lord.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 16, 17.</NOTE></Q> And we are informed in the &s;ame chapter, that he thus judged "I&s;rael all the days of his life. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 15.</NOTE>" From which latter circum&s;tance, as well as from other things, we learn, that SAMUEL held the office of a judge in I&s;rael, when he was no longer the chief ruler therein, under king Saul, when the form of government was changed. For SAMUEL was the per&s;on chiefly concerned, and employed under God, in rai&s;ing Saul to the throne of I&s;rael; as appears from the particular account of the&s;e matters in &s;acred writ. At pre&s;ent I pa&s;s them over with a bare
<PB N="14" REF="008666_0012_102fac9e08736420">
mention. I al&s;o pa&s;s over, even with|out a mention, many &s;ignal &s;ervices which SAMUEL did to the people of I&s;rael; and many ble&s;&s;ings which he was in&s;trumental of procuring for them from heaven.</P>
<P>This renowned man appears to have been an excellent patriot; one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t that the world has known. He intirely loved his country; and was ever properly jealous for its laws and liberties. He not only exerted him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;sfully in their defence again&s;t foreign enemies; but did whatever lay in his power to &s;e|cure them again&s;t the equally, or more dangerous efforts of ambition, intrigue, and tyranny within. His great zeal for the laws, rights and liberties of the people, appears not only from his &s;teady and up|right conduct in the capacity of a judge, of which more particularly hereafter; but from his behaviour upon &s;ome very &s;ignal occa&s;ions, which &s;hould not be intirely omitted here.</P>
<P>When the people were di&s;gu&s;ted, not without &s;ufficient rea&s;on, at the conduct of two of SAMUEL's &s;ons, and doubtle&s;s had their pa&s;&s;ions blown up by &s;ome evil-minded per&s;ons, de&s;irous of novelty and
<PB N="15" REF="008666_0013_102faca0b40477a0">
change; they manife&s;ted them&s;elves weary of the free and excellent form of govern|ment, which God him&s;elf had in&s;tituted among&s;t them; they required a change therein, and reque&s;ted SAMUEL to &s;et a king, or ab&s;olute monarch, over them, <Q>like all the nations <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Vid. 1 Sam. VIII. at large.</NOTE></Q> about them. SAMUEL earne&s;tly expo&s;tulated with them on the &s;ubject of this mad propo&s;al; not for his own &s;ake, le&s;t his power &s;hould be dimi|ni&s;hed, but becau&s;e he fore&s;aw the evils, the oppre&s;&s;ions, and the grievous &s;lavery, they would bring upon them&s;elves by &s;uch a change of government. But having <Q>prote&s;ted &s;olemnly unto them, and &s;hew|ed them the manner of the king</Q>; and when nothing el&s;e would appea&s;e them, he gave way to their importunate cla|mours; he "hearkened to their voice," and anointed Saul to be their king, accor|ding to the divine direction. For it &s;eems that God him&s;elf would not pre&s;erve them a free people, again&s;t their own will; and therefore "gave them a king in his anger;" to &s;courge them for their folly, and for their rebellion again&s;t him&s;elf. However, at length, when SAMUEL's prediction had, doubtle&s;s, been &s;ufficiently verified, and Saul's reign was grown in&s;upportable,
<PB N="16" REF="008666_0014_102faca5931eaf10">
SAMUEL was a principal in&s;trument of &s;etting him a&s;ide; and he anointed David the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e, a man after God's own heart, to &s;it upon the throne of I&s;rael in his &s;tead. Now amid&s;t all this madne&s;s of the people, the&s;e turns and revolutions of government, SAMUEL &s;till di&s;covered him&s;elf to be a true patriot, zealous for the liberties and intere&s;ts of his country: Equally &s;o, in di&s;countenancing, and enter|ing his prote&s;tation again&s;t, their fir&s;t de|mand of a king; in complying therewith when nothing el&s;e would &s;atisfy them; in &s;etting a&s;ide their king, when his be|haviour became intolerable; and anoint|ing a far better man to reign in his &s;tead. All which, it mu&s;t be remembred, SAMUEL did, not without the particular permi&s;&s;ion and direction of heaven; as appears at large from the remarkable hi&s;tory of the&s;e tran|&s;actions.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve farther here, that while Saul &s;at upon the throne, SAMUEL did not only continue in the ex|ecutive office of a judge in I&s;rael; but was, at lea&s;t for a time, one of his chief coun|&s;ellors. We read of his giving him advice from time to time; and freely reproving him for his faults: Tho' he adhered to
<PB N="17" REF="008666_0015_102faca72159d398">
him, till God &s;ignified his intention to de|&s;troy him for his bad behaviour. After which, SAMUEL renounced him, anointed David, adhered to him and his cau&s;e; and was his chief advi&s;er and coun&s;ellor, as long as he [SAMUEL] lived.</P>
<P>But having ju&s;t ob&s;erved the&s;e things, it is now time to &s;peak more particularly of SAMUEL's integrity in the capacity of a judge: For this is the character under which he is more commonly con&s;idered. And to his fidelity in this important tru&s;t, we have one very authentic, indeed a very &s;ingular, te&s;timony, in &s;acred hi&s;to|ry; one, which is &s;o full, that it will &s;uper&s;ede the occa&s;ion, at lea&s;t the ne|ce&s;&s;ity, for any others. It is in the 12th chapter of that book which has been &s;o often mentioned already, at the beginning. It appears from the la&s;t ver&s;e of the fore|going chapter, that all the people were gathered together at Gilgal, to confirm the kingdom to Saul, and to e&s;tabli&s;h him in the throne of I&s;rael; he having been before anointed king by SAMUEL. And they being thus gathered together, SA|MUEL, already grown old in their &s;ervice, took this mo&s;t public, and &s;olemn occa|&s;ion, to appeal to their own con&s;ciences
<PB N="18" REF="008666_0016_102faca8a87bff98">
for the uprightne&s;s of all his conduct to|wards them; when he al&s;o challenged all, or any of them, to bear witne&s;s again&s;t him before the Lord, and before Saul his anointed, who had now power to puni&s;h him, if they could alledge any thing a|gain&s;t him.</P>
<P>There is at once &s;uch a noble boldne&s;s, &s;uch a &s;implicity, and &s;uch a dignity, in this appeal and challenge of SAMUEL, that I que&s;tion whether the repetition of it at large, will &s;eem tedious on this occa&s;ion, to any who have a true ta&s;te and judg|ment: I rather think it will be agreeable and entertaining. It is as follows: <Q>Be|hold, I have hearkned to your voice in all that ye have &s;aid unto me, and have made a king over you. And now be|hold the king walketh before you: and I am old, and gray-headed; and behold, my &s;ons are with you; and I have walked before you from my child|hood to this day. Behold, here I am, witne&s;s again&s;t me before the Lord, and before his anointed. Who&s;e ox have I taken? or who&s;e a&s;s have I ta|ken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppre&s;&s;ed? or of who&s;e hand have I received any bribe to blind
<PB N="19" REF="008666_0017_102facab50a736d0">
mine eyes therewith? and I will re&s;tore it to you <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. XII.1, 2, 3.</NOTE></Q> We may &s;ee, in this chal|lenge, that inimitable kind of boldne&s;s which a good con&s;cience in&s;pires; &s;uch a boldne&s;s, as &s;urpa&s;&s;es all the power of art, and the deepe&s;t hypocri&s;y, to counterfeit &s;o exactly, but that &s;ome difference might be di&s;covered by a penetrating eye. And you will be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that this appeal and demand are general. Tho' SAMUEL here &s;peaks with particular refe|rence to his conduct in the capacity of a judge; yet he refers the people to his manner of life in general, even from his childhood to that day. His demand ex|tends to his whole conduct towards them. He does not only acquit him&s;elf of cor|ruption, or receiving bribes; but, <Q>Whom have I defrauded?</Q> &s;ays he; <Q>Whom have I oppre&s;&s;ed?</Q> i. e. in any re&s;pect whatever, from my youth to old age, not|with&s;tanding my opportunity and power to oppre&s;s, in the high &s;tation which I have filled? Let my accu&s;er now &s;tand forth; and freely bear witne&s;s again&s;t me before God and the king. This is the evident purport of his words.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="008666_0018_102facb0251d6f30">Alas! how few judges, or other per&s;ons in high &s;tations, wherein they have op|portunity to oppre&s;s, and to do iniquity, are there in mo&s;t countries, who would dare to make the like demand in the face of a whole people?

<P>He was a "plant of renown" in that &s;eminary of learning, even from the time of his being tran&s;planted into it from an inferior &s;chool. He was early di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the &s;prightline&s;s and brillancy of his genius, and by the rapid progre&s;s which he made in academical learning: which, in conjunction with an agreeable per&s;on, a chearful, affable di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;ingular delicacy of manners, render'd him at once the delight, and the admiration, of that &s;o|ciety. And altho' he was, of the two, ra|ther of a gay than of a grave turn, yet this was never indulged to exce&s;s; but always re&s;trained within the rules of virtue, and a &s;trict decorum. His morals were &s;till unblemi&s;hed; and his life, not only inof|fen&s;ive, but exemplary. This is not &s;aid at random, or as a thing of cour&s;e; but up|on the authority of tho&s;e who were co|temporary with him in that &s;ociety. So that there is rea&s;on to think, he truly fear|ed God from his youth.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="008666_0024_102facbde7d1b5d8">On his leaving that &s;chool of the &s;ons of the prophets, &s;oon after receiving the fir&s;t public honors of it at the u&s;ual time, anno 1721, when he was con&s;ider'd as one of the brighte&s;t &s;cholars it had ever produced, he took up his re&s;idence in one of our &s;ea|port towns <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ead.</NOTE>. Here his fine talents were for &s;ome time very u&s;efully, tho' humbly employed, in keeping a &s;chool. For, be|&s;ides that his patrimony could not be great, as may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, he never thought him&s;elf above doing any thing, by which he might be &s;erviceable in the world. And he was in high e&s;teem among&s;t the gen|tlemen of that town; who, as all wi&s;e and good men have ever done, con&s;idered rather the per&s;on and his accompli&s;hments, than the &s;phere in which he acted.</P>
<P>However, at the expiration of about three or four years (for I do not exactly know the time) he returned to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and betook him&s;elf to a collegiate life; where he pur&s;ued his &s;tudies with great &s;ucce&s;s, and a growing fame: For while he was thus a &s;tudent at the college, he was e&s;|teemed one principal ornament and honor to it.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="008666_0025_102facbf6fcb7558">After re&s;iding therein a &s;uitable time; and when, be&s;ides other very valuable ac|quirements in the literary way, he had made great proficiency in &s;acred learning, and the &s;tudy of theology, he became a preacher of the go&s;pel, mini&s;tring before the Lord and his people; tho' not while "a child," as SAMUEL did, and as &s;ome others &s;ince, without SAMUEL's extraor|dinary call, or qualifications, have pre&s;um|ed to do.&mdash;It were almo&s;t needle&s;s to ob|&s;erve, that his public performances as a preacher of the go&s;pel, were truly excel|lent: For &s;uch a genius, &s;o cultivated and matur'd, join'd with a good, devout and warm heart, like his, could, certainly, pro|duce nothing but what was &s;o. He was, without doubt, one of the mo&s;t accom|pli&s;h'd preachers of his time; and was ac|knowledg'd as &s;uch by all competent and unprejudiced judges, e&s;pecially by the be&s;t.

<P>He was at length, upon a vacancy, in the year 1728, cho&s;en a tutor of the col|lege,
<PB N="28" REF="008666_0026_102facc6aa49bea0">
where he was &s;till a re&s;ident: A &s;ta|tion, for which his talents were uncom|monly adaped; and which he continued to fill &s;everal years, without laying a&s;ide that &s;acred employment wherein he had before been engaged. However, after &s;ome time, he laid that wholly a&s;ide; de|voting him&s;elf to the di&s;charge of his tru&s;t as a tutor of the college. And, as may ea&s;ily be concluded, he, who was &s;o bright an ornament of that learned &s;ociety, even during the time of his own pupillage, and before his years of puberty were pa&s;t, &s;hone with a very di&s;tingui&s;h'd lu&s;tre in the capacity of one of the governors and in&s;tructors of it; when he had attained to &s;uch a maturity of age; when he had been all along adding to his great &s;tock of learn|ing and knowledge, and had al&s;o gained con&s;iderable experience. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aetat 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>His genius and talents, as before ob&s;erv|ed, were wonderfully adapted to this em|ployment. And it was in this capacity, that &s;ome of his excellent endowments, both natural and acquired, appeared to more advantage than they had ever done, or could, in any other, wherein he had acted before. It was in this &s;tation, that
<PB N="29" REF="008666_0027_102facc85357ef50">
his learning, before indeed well known, became &s;till more con&s;picuous; and not only his learning, but his great happine&s;s and facility in teaching, and communica|ting knowledge: Both, now di&s;play'd them&s;elves to the full, there being proper &s;cope for them; while he took a plea&s;ure, not in an o&s;tentatious di&s;covery of his own &s;uperior talents, but in making them u&s;e|ful to others. It was in this capacity, that his admirable &s;pirit of government became manife&s;t to all. It was in this capacity, that his exqui&s;ite prudence and di&s;cretion became more apparent, by his manner of conducting towards the youth of that &s;o|ciety, in the happie&s;t medium between too much au&s;terity and rigor on one hand, and remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, or familiarity on the other. In this &s;tation he, at lea&s;t continued to di&s;cover a great, inviolable regard, to re|ligion and virtue. I &s;ay, "at lea&s;t con|tinued" to do &s;o; becau&s;e it was, perhaps, hardly po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover that particular quality in this &s;tation, more plainly than he had done before. However, he now made it one principal part of his care, to guard his pupils again&s;t the &s;nares of vice; and to form their minds, as far as this was in the power of man, to the love of piety and virtue. In doing which, he neglect|ed
<PB N="30" REF="008666_0028_102facc9db51fcf0">
neither the mo&s;t kind, &s;erious and pa|thetic coun&s;els on one hand, nor the exer|ci&s;e of his authority on the other, when|ever there was a proper occa&s;ion and call to employ it. In this &s;tation he &s;hew'd, in a way almo&s;t peculiar to him&s;elf, how con&s;i&s;tent the mo&s;t re&s;olute and vigorous exertion of authority is with the mo&s;t courteous, conde&s;cending temper of mind, and the mo&s;t gentle, complacent manners. For I believe he had hardly a pupil &s;o abandon'd, as not at once to love him as his be&s;t friend, and to revere him as a father; I had almo&s;t &s;aid, as his guardian angel! Vice turn'd pale, trembled, and fled at his frown; or even at the ca&s;t of his countenance without one. Virtue ap|proach'd, exulted, and was improved at his &s;mile: while learning and arts flouri&s;h'd under his eye in that &s;eminary, like the goodly flowers in <HI>Eden</HI> under the warm, all-enlivening beam of heaven. And there are now among&s;t us many per&s;ons, great ble&s;&s;ings both in the church and &s;tate, as well as in more common life, who had the happine&s;s to receive their education im|mediately under him. In one word, I be|lieve there is no per&s;on, however worthy, who would think his own merit impair'd, or his honor touch'd, if it &s;hould be added,

that con&s;idering his &s;tation in the college, and the time he continued therein, that learned &s;ociety never enjoyed a greater ble&s;&s;ing and ornament in any one man, than in Mr. SEWALL. And I can hardly think of him in this &s;tation, without hav|ing my thoughts carried back to SAMUEL at Naioth, among&s;t the &s;ons of the pro|phets, as one "appointed over them." <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The author of this di&s;cour&s;e did not indeed enter into the college, till the year after Mr. <HI>Sewall</HI> left it: But nothing is &s;aid above, but upon good authority.</NOTE></P>
<P>While Mr. SEWALL was a re&s;ident at the college, more e&s;pecially towards the latter part of the time, he applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the law, as much as he well could without neglecting the proper du|ties of his &s;tation; in the di&s;charge where|of he was ever diligent and faithful. This he did with a view to changing his man|ner of life, and betaking him&s;elf to the bar. And only to have mentioned his applying his mind in any mea&s;ure to this &s;tudy, is equivalent to &s;aying, that he &s;oon acquired a very con&s;iderable knowledge in the law. For his genius was &s;o piercing, and his na|tural penetration at once &s;o deep and quick, that no &s;cience, however crabbed, intricate or involv'd, could long make oppo&s;ition thereto In whatever he engaged, he be|came
<PB N="32" REF="008666_0030_102facd30cca6618">
a con&s;iderable proficient therein, as it were at once: &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly quick was his apprehen&s;ion of things; &s;o clear his head; &s;o acute and deep his di&s;cernment.</P>
<P>Being thus qualified, he was, in the year 1739, called from his collegiate, into an higher &s;phere of life; viz. to take a &s;eat on the bench of the &s;uperiour court of judica|ture for the province. This was done without his making any intere&s;t for it.&mdash; And it was well for his country that many per&s;ons, and among&s;t them, gentlemen of authority and influence in the government, were acquainted with his great abilities and merit; to which he him&s;elf ever appeared more a &s;tranger than any other per&s;on, who had any knowledge of him. And SAMUEL's being cloathed with a civil character, after being &s;ome time in other employments, is here brought to mind&mdash;</P>
<P>In this new &s;tation he became more generally known, and therefore more ge|nerally e&s;teemed; as well as, perhaps, more exten&s;ively u&s;eful. His wi&s;dom and in|tegrity were &s;o con&s;picuous herein, and gave him &s;uch an acknowledged pre|eminence, that on the death of the ho|norable and learned chief ju&s;tice DUDLEY,
<PB N="33" REF="008666_0031_102facd4a323b270">
he was, in 175<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, appointed to &s;ucceed him in that important office, to the general &s;a|tisfaction, and even joy of the province; altho' he was not the &s;enior of the then worthy &s;urviving judges.</P>
<P>This promotion, which was not only un&s;ollicited, but even oppos'd by him&s;elf, without altering his mind or manners in the lea&s;t, &s;till enlarged the &s;phere of his in|fluence; that influence, which was ever u&s;eful ju&s;t &s;o far as it extended; being ne|ver employed, but in doing good, or pre|venting evil; which is in effect the &s;ame thing. He &s;u&s;tained this high office with the reputation of great wi&s;dom, and of &s;trict fidelity. He al&s;o &s;upported the dig|nity of it, by his conduct in it. For, tho' he was truly a mo&s;t humble and mode&s;t man; yet he well knew what was due to his &s;tation. Nor did he, by any means, want the re&s;olution to maintain, and to vindicate the honor of it, as occa&s;ion re|quired. He had indeed the quicke&s;t, as well as the exacte&s;t &s;en&s;e, of true honor: And he di&s;covered in this capicity, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, that admirable &s;pirit of go|vernment which was mentioned before on another occa&s;ion. He pre&s;erved a great decorum in the court: He mode|rated
<PB N="34" REF="008666_0032_102facd62b44a900">
the debates with a becoming calm|ne&s;s and dignity, in conjunction with a &s;trict impartiality: Shewing him&s;elf at once the man of honor and &s;pirit, the knowing lawyer, and the upright judge.</P>
<P>Altho' his reputation was great, even at his fir&s;t coming upon the bench, it was daily growing till the time when heaven was plea&s;ed to take him from it. He was both "a terror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to them that did well," in the admini&s;trati|on of ju&s;tice; in which he went from one part of the country to another, like a &s;e|cond SAMUEL. And, where "his return was," we all know. Nor is there the lea&s;t rea&s;on to doubt, but that he might to the very la&s;t, have appealed to the whole pro|vince, as SAMUEL did to all I&s;rael, boldly challenging them to witne&s;s any wrong, or unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in him, in the very lan|guage of that good judge:&mdash;<Q>Whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppre&s;&s;ed? or of who&s;e hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?</Q> mdash; And had he done &s;o, this whole people in general, unle&s;s they had been le&s;s grateful and ju&s;t than the I&s;raelites (who were not, however, very remarkable for tho&s;e virtues) would doubtle&s;s have an&s;wered as they
<PB N="35" REF="008666_0033_102facd7b6ac9118">
did&mdash;<Q>Thou ha&s;t not defrauded us, nor oppre&s;&s;ed us; neither ha&s;t thou taken ought of any mans hand.</Q> Yea, it may be que&s;tion'd, whether ever any per&s;on a|mong&s;t us, was &s;o impudent as to make an attempt upon his honor, by the offer of a bribe. For his heart was not only incapable of admitting the lea&s;t venality, or corruption of this &s;ort; but univer&s;ally known to be &s;o; and more immutably fixed to the love of ju&s;tice, than the nee|dle to the pole: For even that varies and deviates; and may, at any time, be &s;haken from its proper point to a contrary direc|tion: While his ju&s;tice appear'd as un|moveable as the "everla&s;ting hills;" or rather, pur&s;u'd its appointed cour&s;e in his circuit, like the undeviating &s;un in the fir|mament of heaven.&mdash;Ju&s;tice mu&s;t, how|ever, be here under&s;tood, only in contra|di&s;tinction to wrong, injury, or po&s;itive inju&s;tice; and not, as it is &s;ome times, in oppo&s;ition to mercy and compa&s;&s;ion. For in criminal matters, I believe he always in|clin'd to the &s;ide of clemency and mercy, where there was legal room for the exer|ci&s;e of them; and whenever &s;everity was not apparently nece&s;&s;ary for the common good, which he &s;till kept in view: Herein imitating the &s;upreme governor of the
<PB N="36" REF="008666_0034_102facdfb4d24338">
world, who does not "willingly," much le&s;s wantonly, afflict and grieve the child|ren of men; but, either for their own pro|fit, or for the pre&s;ervation of order, and public good; that others may <Q>&s;ee and fear, and not do &s;o wickedly.</Q></P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be forgotten here, that &s;oon after he was promoted to the important tru&s;t of chief ju&s;tice, he was elected a mem|ber of his Maje&s;ty's council for the pro|vince; and continued to be &s;o elected every year &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to the la&s;t. He had indeed been in nomination for a &s;eat at that honorable board &s;everal years before; and many worthy per&s;ons were very pre&s;&s;ing and urgent in the affair. But he him&s;elf made oppo&s;ition to it; and this, partly at lea&s;t, becau&s;e he doubted the expediency of his being at once a judge of the court, and at the council table; thinking that, hereby, he might be brought "into temptation and a &s;nare;" or, in plain words, &s;ubject him&s;elf to &s;ome <HI>undue influence.</HI> This may be depended on as a certain fact. So extremely tender, &s;o delicate was his con&s;cience; &s;o nice his &s;en&s;e of honor; and &s;o great his diffidence of him&s;elf! He therefore utterly declined all propo&s;als of this &s;ort, and per&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="37" REF="008666_0035_102face142e28a68">
therein, that he might keep him&s;elf as in|dependent as po&s;&s;ible. However, his friends, who knew him incapable of being unduly bia&s;s'd by any means or circum&s;tances whatever; and were &s;atisfied, he would be very &s;erviceable at the board, would not de&s;i&s;t: And he was accordingly elect|ed a member of the council, again&s;t all the oppo&s;ition he could well make. Nor was it without con&s;iderable difficulty, that he was finally prevailed upon to drop his objec|tions, and to accept, after he was cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Thus, like SAMUEL of old, after hav|ing been many years a judge, he became one of the king's council. And at that honorable board, as in every other capa|city, he &s;hew'd him&s;elf the wi&s;e and up|right man: And not only &s;o; for he was one of eminent di&s;tinction among&s;t others of the &s;ame character. This was more e&s;pecially the &s;phere in which his pa|trioti&s;m di&s;cover'd it&s;elf. For while he was &s;trictly loyal, and attached to the pre|&s;ent royal family on revolution-principles (which were al&s;o the principles of SA|MUEL;) while he was &s;teady, on one hand, in a&s;&s;erting the rights of the crown, and of his Maje&s;ty's governor; he was, on the other hand, a mo&s;t zealous friend to his
<PB N="38" REF="008666_0036_102face2dc5c6bf8">
country, its laws and liberties. If at any time things were in agitation, as they &s;ometimes were, which he apprehended incon&s;i&s;tent with, or hazardous to, the ju&s;t rights and liberties of the people, or pre|judicial to them in any other re&s;pect; he had always the integrity and magnanimity to oppo&s;e &s;uch mea&s;ures, whoever ap|pear'd as the fir&s;t promoters, or compliant fautors, of them. Nor did he fear to give his negative to the nominations to civil offices, whenever he conceived the per|&s;ons nominated, to be wholly un&s;uitable for, or unworthy of them.

This he ever gave in the in|tegrity of his heart, without fear, favor, or criminal prejudice.

<P><PB N="39" REF="008666_0037_102face461a34078">It &s;hould be remember'd here, that, as a member of his Maje&s;ty's council, he was one of the over&s;eers of the college: At which board he was eminently &s;ervicea|ble, by his &s;uperior knowledge in literary matters; and by what experience had taught him concerning the be&s;t methods of in&s;tructing and governing that &s;ociety, while he was a tutor in it.</P>
<P>But, if you plea&s;e, we will for the pre|&s;ent take our leave of the excellent &s;cholar, the accompli&s;h'd, upright judge, the wi&s;e and faithful coun&s;ellor, the loyal &s;ubject, and zealous patriot; provided we can, for a moment, &s;eperate the&s;e ideas and cha|racters from this extraordinary per&s;on; and con&s;ider him only in his private capa|city.

<P>He was the mo&s;t agreeable companion, and an accompli&s;h'd gentleman. He was the mo&s;t remote from all appearances of van|ity and affectation. He was of a very &s;ocial and courteous make; and his manner of
<PB N="40" REF="008666_0038_102faceb3492a228">
addre&s;s was particularly engaging. His conver&s;ation was often in&s;tructive, al|ways &s;prightly and entertaining; and in|deed never failed to charm. He "honor'd all men;" treated every one with due re&s;|pect, and never gave cau&s;e of offence or unea&s;ine&s;s to any, whether pre&s;ent or ab&s;ent, by words or actions: of which he was very &s;ingularly cautious. His behaviour was poli&s;h'd, his manners re|fin'd; and had in them that peculiar de|licacy, which all can &s;ee and admire, but none can exactly de&s;cribe. His counte|nance, his whole air and mien, <HI>&s;truck at once,</HI> if I may &s;o expre&s;s it; and attracted the e&s;teem and regard of the &s;pectator, by telling even his eyes, what kind of &s;oul informed the body which he &s;aw before him: While he conver&s;ed with people, both of the lowe&s;t and highe&s;t ranks, with|out the lea&s;t tincture of haughtine&s;s on one hand, or of meanne&s;s on the other.</P>
<P>He was a warm, di&s;crete and faithful friend. He could never be prevailed on to di&s;card, or even to neglect, any one, for whom he had profe&s;&s;ed a regard, on mere &s;u&s;picion, or rumours; or without exa|mining things to the bottom. Nor was he backward to advi&s;e on occa&s;ion, e&s;pecial|ly
<PB N="41" REF="008666_0039_102faceef67a1f08">
when his advice was a&s;ked; for other|wi&s;e he was far from being forward or officious. Nor indeed do I doubt, but that he was as willing to hear, as to give advice, tho' no man le&s;s needed it; he being a kind of oracle to him&s;elf, tho' le&s;s &s;o than he was to others. He was ex|tremely kind and obliging in his temper; and, in &s;hort, di&s;charged all the offices of friend&s;hip in general with the utmo&s;t punctuality, and the mo&s;t nice preci&s;ion. &mdash;It were needle&s;s, after &s;aying thus much of him in the capacity of a friend, to &s;ay any thing of him as a relation; only, that if any &s;hould imagine he was not the very be&s;t and kinde&s;t, it would be a proof that they knew but little of him&mdash;</P>
<P>He was a good ma&s;ter; no ways mo|ro&s;e or au&s;tere; but as kind and indulgent as was con&s;i&s;tent even with the good of his &s;ervants; not to &s;ay, with the duty and &s;ervice which they owed to him; which were &s;uperfluous in &s;peaking of &s;o rea&s;onable and ju&s;t a man.

<P>He was a per&s;on of uncommon candor.

He apparently took a plea&s;ure in thinking and &s;peaking well of all worthy per&s;ons; and often found &s;omething to commend even in tho&s;e, in whom others could find nothing de&s;erving commendation. But if there were any, the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, in whom he could find nothing prai&s;e-worthy, he would at lea&s;t be their apologi&s;t; &s;triving to extenuate their faults by &s;ome means or other, while others could hardly think of any thing but what &s;eemed to be an aggravation of them.

<P><PB N="43" REF="008666_0041_102facf3ce3dd408">And this brings me to what all truly wi&s;e and good men will acknowledge to be the be&s;t part of his character:&mdash;He was an exemplary CHRISTIAN. This, indeed, is implied in what was &s;aid before, concerning the great regard which he all along manife&s;ted to religion and virtue, while a &s;tudent, and tutor at the college; while a preacher of the go&s;pel; and by his &s;trict fidelity both as a judge, and as a coun&s;ellor. But it &s;eemed proper to &s;peak more particular of his religion here, where we are con&s;idering him in his pri|vate capacity.&mdash;He appeared to have an habitual and deep reverence of almighty GOD upon his mind. And I have more than once heard him &s;peak with great plea&s;ure of that circum&s;tance in the cha|racter of Sir MATTHEW HALE, chief ju&s;tice of the king's bench; That he was never known to mention the holy and venerable name of GOD&mdash;without mak|ing a pau&s;e at it in his di&s;cour&s;e.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame is &s;aid of Sir <HI>I.

<P>He was none of tho&s;e who are too wi&s;e to be taught of God; too great to wor|&s;hip

and bow down before him, or too good and gracious to need the means of grace. He con&s;tantly attended (as you, my brethren of this &s;ociety, are witne&s;&s;es) He con&s;tantly attended the wor&s;hip of God, and the ordinances of the go&s;pel, with great reverence, gravity and devo|tion: Which, tho' he was an enemy to o&s;tentation in every thing, and e&s;pecially in religion, were &s;ometimes &s;o apparent in his countenance, that one could not ob|&s;erve it without having his own devotion rai&s;ed and improved, if he had any: and hardly, if he had none before, without catching thereby &s;omething of the &s;ame &s;pirit from him.

<P><PB N="45" REF="008666_0043_102facfc02477f00">He was a firm and zealous friend to the principles of religious liberty, and the &s;a|cred rights of con&s;cience. No man was more free from all &s;uper&s;tition, or from the &s;ordid, illiberal &s;pirit of party. No man was more catholic towards chri&s;tians of different denominations; or farther from a &s;pirit of bigotry, contention and cen&s;o|riou&s;ne&s;s. It was before ob&s;erved, that he was a firm believer of the chri&s;tian re|ligion in general; and he was &s;o in parti|cular, of the atonement made by the death of CHRIST for the &s;ins of the world; and of that <Q>life and immortality, brought to light by him thro' the go&s;pel;</Q> in which he expre&s;&s;ed an humble hope, in my hearing, a few hours before he expired.</P>
<P>He appear'd to have a great concern for the intere&s;t of chri&s;tianity in the world. And, by repeated conver&s;ations with him on the &s;ubject, I know he had very much at heart the coming into &s;ome &s;cheme, or method, for propagating the go&s;pel a|mong&s;t the natives of the&s;e northern parts of <HI>America</HI>: Often expre&s;&s;ing his great &s;orrow that a certain SOCIETY beyond &s;ea, had done nothing, or but very little, to this important end; important, not on|ly in a religious view of things, but &s;econ|darily, in a civil and political.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="008666_0044_102facfd94497758">But not to digre&s;s: His whole life in general was apparently conducted under the influence, and according to the pre|cepts, of our holy religion: Which is the mo&s;t authentic evidence, at lea&s;t to others, of a per&s;on's being a thorough chri&s;tian.

He appeared, in reality, to "love his neighbour as him|&s;elf." His heart &s;eemed, not only always open, but expanded wide; even wider than the earth, and "broader than the &s;ea." And had his fortune been of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions with his &s;oul, he would have been the common, public almoner, even without being appointed by any, under God, to the di&s;charge of that office; di&s;tributing, not only to the nece&s;|&s;ities of the &s;aints, but to every proper ob|ject of charity, far and near.

<P>That this would have been his manner of employing riches, is &s;ufficiently evident by the u&s;e he made of what he had.

Often did the ble&s;&s;ing of the poor, and of him that was ready to peri&s;h, come upon him. Even in his narrow circum&s;tances, he was like Job in the days of his pro&s;peri|ty, "eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame." And how often has he cau&s;ed the "widow's heart to &s;ing for joy!"</P>
<P>Let me here ju&s;t mention one thing more, which among&s;t innumerable others, plainly &s;hew'd the goodne&s;s of his heart.
<PB N="48" REF="008666_0046_102fad0233ff8600">
In the exerci&s;e of his office as chief ju&s;tice, he had repeated occa&s;ions to pronounce &s;entence of death upon malefactors.

<P>But there is not time to be more parti|cular on the character of this excellent and amiable man. The&s;e are the outlines of it, truly, tho' very imperfectly drawn. To &s;um up all in a few words: Altho' I have known &s;ome very &s;avage and brutal per&s;ons; &s;ome very ignorant and &s;tupid, and &s;ome very wicked and abandon'd ones; yet I never knew one &s;o &s;avage and brutal, as not to be charm'd, as it were, with the poli&s;h'd manners of judge SEWALL; &s;o ignorant and &s;tupid, as not to &s;ee and ac|knowledge him to have been a wi&s;e man; or &s;o wicked and abandon'd, as not to re|vere him as a good one; for I know a bad man cannot really love a good one, as &s;uch. And the better title any had them&s;elves, to the&s;e characters of poli&s;h'd, wi&s;e and
<PB N="49" REF="008666_0047_102fad086da8f700">
good, the more ready, proportionably, they always were to give <HI>him</HI> the prai&s;e of them. Some other per&s;ons of great abili|ties and merit, in different parts of the world, have not been generally e&s;teem'd and belov'd, becau&s;e people did not know their true characters; and had conceived &s;ome unrea&s;onable prejudices again&s;t them. But it was his felicity, or rather his coun|try's, that he was known, and therefore e&s;teemed from the fir&s;t, and &s;till more at the la&s;t; &s;o that the public had the bene|fit of his &s;uperiour talents. Many others in &s;uch eminent &s;tations as his, have had &s;ome to envy, and &s;peak evil of them, to the le&s;&s;ening of their u&s;efulne&s;s. But it was his, and his country's felicity, that his abilities and virtues were at lea&s;t as con&s;picuous as his &s;tation: So as to ex|empt him from envy and detraction, and to make the &s;phere of his influence very exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>Some, however, will perhaps curiou&s;|ly inquire, "Whether this man had no faults?"&mdash;If he had any, habitual to him, they were very <HI>uncommon</HI> ones for this age of the world; for they con&s;i&s;ted in the <HI>ex|ce&s;s</HI> of the&s;e two virtues, <HI>liberality</HI> and <HI>&s;elf-diffidence!</HI> And if, by the former, he &s;eemed
<PB N="50" REF="008666_0048_102fad09f86f4400">
to injure him&s;elf; yet at the &s;ame time he re&s;embled the poor widow in the go&s;pel, who <Q>of her penury ca&s;t in unto the of|ferings of God, all the living which &s;he had:</Q> being commended by HIM who taught, that <Q>it is more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive;</Q> and who, <Q>altho' he were rich, yet for our &s;akes became poor.</Q>&mdash;By the latter of them, he may indeed have done a negative injury to others. For had he had this quality of &s;elf-diffidence in a le&s;s degree, he might, po&s;&s;ibly, have been more of a <HI>leader</HI> than he &s;eems to have been, in the affairs of the public; from which, &s;ome additional ad|vantages would probably have accrued to it.&mdash;But how many per&s;ons, at lea&s;t in <HI>other governments,</HI> have done almo&s;t irre|parable damage to the public, on the other hand, by their exce&s;s of ra&s;hne&s;s, &s;elf-con|ceit and officiou&s;ne&s;s; by their pre&s;ump|tion, and driving, as it were, all before them?&mdash;If <HI>that</HI> may be call'd a <HI>fault</HI> in him, which yet admits of &s;ome doubt; <HI>this</HI> is, without any doubt, a <HI>crime</HI> in them; and will not &s;o readily be excu&s;ed. But among&s;t all the various woes denounced again&s;t different per&s;ons in &s;cripture, there &s;eems to be none which &s;o much con|cerned

<P>It appears, I &s;uppo&s;e, not to have been wholly without rea&s;on, that SAMUEL's conduct and character were pitched on by way of introduction to the character and conduct of that di&s;tingui&s;h'd and e|minent per&s;on, of whom I have been &s;peaking. For, was the former a fearer and &s;ervant of God even from his early youth? We have rea&s;on to think the latter was &s;o likewi&s;e. Was the former brought up in the &s;chool of the &s;ons of the prophets? So, in effect, was the latter.

Did the for|mer mini&s;ter before the Lord and his peo|ple in the &s;acred offices of religion? So did the latter. Did the former become in time, an in&s;tructor and governor in that college wherein he had received his education, and prove a great ble&s;&s;ing to it? So did the latter. Was the former at length cloathed with the important office of a judge? So was the latter. Did the former travel from place to place in the di&s;charge of this laborious tru&s;t? So did the latter. Did the former wor&s;hip the
<PB N="52" REF="008666_0050_102fad13318ae450">
Lord in his own hou&s;e, as well as in pub|lic? So did the latter. Did the people "fear the LORD and Samuel?" But many of tho&s;e who did not fear the Lord, yet feared the latter, who was a terror to their evil works. Was the former emi|nently faithful and upright, in the exerci&s;e of his authority? So was the latter. Was the former at length one of the king's council? So was the latter. Was the for|mer a true patriot; a lover of his coun|try, its laws and liberties; and an enemy to all tyranny and tyrants? So was the latter. Was the former in all re&s;pects a worthy, good and amiable per&s;on? So was the latter. Were the great merits, and public &s;ervices of the former, acknow|ledged by all the people in general? So were tho&s;e of the latter. Did the former continue all the days of his life in the faithful di&s;charge of his important tru&s;t? So did the latter. Was the former ju&s;tly and univer&s;ally lamented at his death? So is the latter&mdash;</P>
<P>Thus far the parallel &s;eems to hold in general, without u&s;ing any unnatural vi|olence; tho' it will not do &s;o in &s;ome o|ther re&s;pects. SAMUEL, for example, had children, who gave him trouble by
<PB N="53" REF="008666_0051_102fad14c46818f8">
their ill behaviour; but the other had none. And yet how many per&s;ons have in him lo&s;t a father! while he has obtain|ed a "name better than that of &s;ons or of daughters"; far better indeed, than that of &s;uch as &s;ome of SAMUEL's <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Judge SEWALL died a Bachelor.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SAMUEL was, moreover, a prophet of the Lord, being immediately in&s;pired by him. Such was not the latter. But yet he &s;aw, heard and believed tho&s;e things, of which many prophets and righteous men, and kings in tho&s;e remote ages, un|der&s;tood but little at mo&s;t. And indeed the father of &s;pirits gave him &s;uch a ge|nius as, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, might &s;upply the place of in&s;piration! But this would be extravagant.&mdash;However, his great know|ledge can hardly be &s;aid to have been ac|quired by little and little, in the ordinary way, and by much pains: It was rather a kind of immediate intuition; &s;uch as we may &s;uppo&s;e in &s;ome beings of an higher order. It was &s;o quick, clear and piercing, that, like the lightning, it ex|tended in a moment to all parts under heaven, the origin and &s;ource of both.</P>
<P>But there is another thing, wherein the parallel fails: For SAMUEL lived till he

was far advanced in years; and died in old age, when, as we may naturally &s;up|po&s;e, the common infirmities of it had render'd him almo&s;t incapable of &s;erving the public any longer&mdash;But the other, alas! died at an age, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aetat. 58.</NOTE> when he might proba|bly have been a great public ble&s;&s;ing for many years longer, had heaven &s;par'd him to us&mdash;However, in what does honor|able old age con&s;i&s;t? Does it <Q>&s;tand in length of time?</Q> or is it only <Q>mea|&s;ured by number of years?</Q> Does it not rather con&s;i&s;t in piety, virtue, and doing many and great public &s;ervices? In &s;hort, is not <Q>wi&s;dom the gray hair un|to men; and an un&s;potted life, old age?</Q> If we mea&s;ure the life of that excellent man, who&s;e death we now mourn, by this &s;tandard (which we find in the <HI>Wi&s;dom of Solomon;</HI>) tho' we cannot &s;ay, perhaps, that he lived &s;o long as SAMUEL, yet we may ju&s;tly &s;ay, that but few per&s;ons have lived &s;o long in the world as he, at lea&s;t in this country; or died in &s;uch <Q>a good old age.</Q></P>
<P>However, we ju&s;tly lament him dead; becau&s;e, had his life been pre&s;erved, he might have probably continued a great public ble&s;&s;ing many years longer. And

the manner in which his funeral rites were attended the la&s;t evening, is a &s;uffi|cient proof that what has been &s;aid of him, is, in general, the &s;en&s;e of the public&mdash; But the will of heaven is done; and <Q>&s;hall not the JUDGE OF ALL THE EARTH do right!</Q></P>

<P>They who had no very particular know|ledge of judge SEWALL, may perhaps &s;u&s;pect that I have &s;poken of him in a

&s;tyle extravagantly hyperbolical. But I am in no pain le&s;t others, who had the happine&s;s of a thorough acquaintance with him, &s;hould think me chargeable with this. The memory of &s;uch eminently wi&s;e, ju&s;t and good men, ought indeed to be ble&s;&s;ed; not in the frigid language of indifference, but in all that ardor of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, which naturally flows from an heart truly &s;en&s;ible of their worth, and deeply touched by their lo&s;s. And it &s;eems but equitable and congruous, that HE, who never &s;poke evil of any one, but honour'd all men, and delighted in giving all their due &s;hare of prai&s;e; &s;hould, at lea&s;t when he is dead and gone, be prai&s;ed by all in his turn; and &s;o much the ra|ther, becau&s;e he would not willingly &s;uf|fer any one to commend him while living; which was the truth as to this excellent per&s;on.</P>
<P>THe a&s;&s;embly has been detained &s;o long already, that I mu&s;t be much more brief than I intended in tho&s;e reflections, with which this di&s;cour&s;e is now to be clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>We may ju&s;tly con&s;ider the death of this truly worthy per&s;on, as a common, public lo&s;s; and a great frown of divine

providence upon the whole province. The lo&s;s of &s;uch a per&s;on in &s;uch a &s;tation, is doubtle&s;s a <HI>public calamity</HI>; and great, in proportion to the exten&s;ivene&s;s of the ble&s;|&s;ing once enjoyed in him; who was &s;uch a friend to learning and religion; &s;uch a lover of his country, it's liberties and laws; who &s;cattered the wicked with his eye; who &s;topped the mouth of iniquity; and, under God, cau&s;ed judgment to flow down as a river. In &s;hort, in what one per&s;on among us, could the republic of letters, the law, the courts of ju&s;tice, the common-wealth, the church of God, have &s;u&s;tained a greater lo&s;s <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Per&s;ons of a <HI>&s;uperior rank</HI> ought always to be &s;uppo&s;ed excepted, when this manner of expre&s;&s;ion is u&s;ed.</NOTE>? Nor are we, I hope, &s;o degenerate as the people of I&s;rael were, at the time when it was &s;aid,&mdash;<Q>The righteous dieth, and no man layeth it to heart.</Q> No! we all in gene|ral lay to heart the death of this one righ|teous man, at lea&s;t. And it may be que&s;|tioned, whether ever a per&s;on died among us, before him, at once more univer&s;ally, and more &s;incerely, lamented. There is not, I believe, an heart but what feels this lo&s;s in &s;ome degree: For, indeed, that man who is wholly in&s;en&s;ible of it, if there be &s;uch an one, cannot be &s;aid to have any <HI>heart</HI> at all; at lea&s;t not an "heart of

fle&s;h", but only an "heart of &s;tone", or of iron; an heart in&s;en&s;ible to every thing worthy, great and good.</P>
<P>But we ought not only to con&s;ider the lo&s;s it &s;elf; we &s;hould, as was intimated before, con&s;ider the holy hand and provi|dence of God therein. God, by the pro|phet I&s;aiah, among&s;t &s;ome other &s;ore ca|lamities which he brought, or threatned to bring, on his people of old for their &s;ins, &s;peaks of taking away &s;uch eminent per|&s;ons; and leaving their places to be filled up by tho&s;e who are wholly unequal to them: <Q>Cea&s;e ye from man who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils: for wherein is he to be accounted of? For behold, the Lord, the Lord of ho&s;ts, doth take away from Jeru&s;alem and from Judah&mdash; the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent &mdash; the honourable man, and the coun&s;el|lor &mdash; and the eloquent orator.

which his hand has made: For with him is "the re&s;idue of the &s;pirit;" the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and prudence, of ju&s;tice and judgment, and of a &s;ound mind. Our &s;uitably con&s;idering his holy providence in this grievous vi&s;itation of it, may be a means of conciliating his favour. And if gracious heaven &s;hall plea&s;e hereafter to give us &s;uch judges and coun&s;ellors <HI>as the la&s;t</HI> decea&s;ed, I think we need not pray for &s;uch as were <HI>at the fir&s;t</HI>: Which is &s;aid, however, without the lea&s;t intention to reflect on the memory of any of the worthy fathers of this country.</P>
<P>There are, to be &s;ure, but very few per&s;ons, equally qualified in all re&s;pects to fill that important &s;tation, which is now left vacant by the death of judge SEWALL. Nor will &s;aying this, I am per&s;waded, give the lea&s;t offence to any; particularly, not to the honorable, and very worthy SUR|VIVING judges of that bench, who have all along manife&s;ted the greate&s;t regard for their dear brother decea&s;ed; who are among&s;t the &s;incere&s;t mourners for him; and who are now paying a public honor to his memory, by their pre&s;ence here, on this occa&s;ion. THEY will doubtle&s;s be excited, by this di&s;pen&s;ation of providence,

to great fidelity in the di&s;charge of their important tru&s;t; pur&s;uing the &s;teps of their departed brother with zeal and vigor: Being thus reminded of their own mor|tality, and of an HIGHER TRIBUNAL, to which all who are judged here below, have a right of appeal; and the judgment of which will be DECISIVE!</P>
<P>The college, as well as the general a&s;|&s;embly, and the &s;uperior court of judica|ture for the province, is particularly con|cerned in this vi&s;itation of divine provi|dence; con&s;idering how long the De|cea&s;ed was a great ble&s;&s;ing and orna|ment to it, while he re&s;ided therein; the great concern which he always manife&s;ted &s;ince, for the intere&s;t of learning and re|ligion there; and his great abilities, and equal zeal to &s;erve it, in the capacity of one of its over&s;eers.</P>
<P>The relatives of the Decea&s;ed, tho&s;e of them that are pre&s;ent, will allow me to exhort them while they &s;orrow, not to "&s;orrow as tho&s;e that have no hope:"&mdash; And al&s;o, while they mourn the Dead, to live as he lived; in expectation of a joyful meeting with him another day; when the times of refre&s;hing &s;hall come from the

I.18.</NOTE></P>
<P>We, my brethren of this a&s;&s;embly, have &s;ome particular rea&s;ons to lay the death of this excellent man to heart; and to attend to the voice of providence therein. He, for many years, came up to this hou&s;e of the Lord in company with us, to wor&s;hip at his foot&s;tool. We have in him lo&s;t, not only an hearty friend to this &s;ociety; but a wi&s;e and prudent advi&s;er on all occa&s;ions, a principal ornament and pillar of it. But you will remember that a "pillar," and the "foundation," the <Q>head of the cor|ner,</Q> or "chief corner-&s;tone," are not the &s;ame thing, or of equal importance to a building; whether a material or <Q>&s;piri|tual hou&s;e.</Q> The former mentioned, tho' indeed a noble "pillar," while it &s;tood erect, was yet a decaying one: It
<PB N="63" REF="008666_0061_102fad3091e4a0a0">
is now, alas! fallen quite down, &s;oon to moulder away, and be reduced to powder and du&s;t; &s;o as never to afford us any farther &s;upport! But the "foundation," the "head of the corner," &s;till remains un&s;haken, unimpaired, an ever "living &s;tone," able to bear up the whole build|ing. For WE, I tru&s;t, were not built, neither did, or do we depend, for our main &s;upport, on any mortal man. We were built on a broad and firm foundation; even <Q>on the foundation of the prophets and apo&s;tles, JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF being the chief corner-&s;tone:</Q> To whom coming as unto a living &s;tone, di&s;|allowed indeed of men, but cho&s;en of God and precious, we al&s;o as lively &s;tones &s;hall be built up in HIM, a &s;piritual hou&s;e, an holy temple in the Lord, for an habi|tation of God thro' the &s;pirit; that we may offer up &s;piritual &s;acrifices, accepta|ble to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And, I tru&s;t, <Q>the gates of hell &s;hall never prevail a|gain&s;t us:</Q> For other foundation [or better] can no man lay!</P>
<P>Let us therefore, my beloved brethren, take encouragement to our&s;elves under this bereaving &s;troke of divine providence; and "&s;tand fa&s;t in the Lord." Let us neither de&s;pi&s;e this cha&s;tening of the Lord,
<PB N="64" REF="008666_0062_102fad388b26d3f0">
nor yet faint, being thus rebuked of him. Let us not de&s;pond; let us not be weary or faint in our minds, while we look unto Je&s;us, the AUTHOR and FINISHER of OUR FAITH; whom <Q>God hath made head over all things to the church.</Q> And let us live in the ob&s;ervance of all his commandments: For, as you well know, he compares tho&s;e that hear his &s;ayings, and do them not, to a fooli&s;h man that "buildeth his hou&s;e upon the &s;and;" which will fall at la&s;t, and great will be its fall! But tho&s;e that hear and do them, he likens, on the contrary, to a wi&s;e man that "buildeth his hou&s;e upon a rock;" which defies all rains, and winds, and &s;torms, and floods, from whatever quar|ter they come, and &s;hall never fall; <Q>for it is founded upon a rock:</Q> And, to apply the words of the apo&s;tle, &s;poken with particular reference to another point &mdash;"That rock is CHRIST."</P>
<P>To conclude: While I was &s;peaking &s;o particularly above, of the character and virtues of that good man, who&s;e lo&s;s we all deplore, I con&s;idered my&s;elf, not mere|ly as paying a &s;mall part of that tribute and honor which are ju&s;tly due to his me|mory; but as reminding you, my bre|thren,
<PB N="65" REF="008666_0063_102fad3a136364e8">
and this whole a&s;&s;embly, of your duty; thinking you would, of cour&s;e, be excited to imitate the virtues which were &s;o con&s;picuous in him. For you will re|member, that altho' we are not all judges, or coun&s;ellors, and do not act in the &s;ame &s;pheres of life that he did; yet we are all bound, in our own, to practi&s;e the very &s;ame virtues, which he did in his; the &s;ame piety towards God, by a due regard to his hou&s;e and wor&s;hip, and in other re&s;pects; the &s;ame ju&s;tice, beneficence and charity towards man; the &s;ame humility and courte&s;y; the &s;ame conde&s;cen&s;ion and goodne&s;s to all. For though our ble&s;&s;ed Lord is our primary, and great, and mo&s;t perfect example; yet we are admoni&s;hed to follow others al&s;o, wherein they fol|lowed him; and to be followers of all them, who thro' faith and patience inherit the promi&s;es. This good man is taken a|way; po&s;&s;ibly from the evil to come on us who &s;urvive: We know not. But cer|tainly the warning voice of this providence to us all, is, "Be ye al&s;o ready:"&mdash; <Q>Boa&s;t not your&s;elves of to-morrow; for ye know not what a day may bring forth.</Q> &mdash;If we truly fear God, and &s;erve him in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, as this good man did, his late departure from us will not prove a <HI>final</HI> adieu! We &s;hall &s;ee him again; not in|deed
<PB N="66" REF="008666_0064_102fad3b9c240a60">
in this &s;tate of darkne&s;s, affliction and trial; but we &s;hall be pre&s;ented together with him before the pre&s;ence of God with exceeding joy, and with crowns of glory from his hand. But as there is <Q>one glory of the &s;un, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the &s;tars;</Q> and as even <Q>one &s;tar differeth from ano|ther &s;tar in glory: So al&s;o is the re&s;ur|rection of the dead.</Q> &mdash;When therefore God him&s;elf, who is light, and in whom there is no darkne&s;s at all, &s;hall &s;hine on all the ble&s;&s;ed in heaven, we may well &s;uppo&s;e that his &s;ervant lately decea&s;ed, will ap|pear with a di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre and glo|ry; even tho' all <Q>the righteous &s;hall &s;hine forth as the &s;un in the kingdom of their Father.</Q></P>
<Q>Now unto HIM, the GOD, the JUDGE, the FATHER OF ALL, who only hath immortality; dwel|ling in light that mortal men can|not approach unto, whom no man hath &s;een, or can &s;ee, and live; of whom, and thro' whom, and to whom are all things:&mdash;Even unto HIM be given all glory and honor, dominion, and ble&s;&s;ing, and prai&s;e, thro' JESUS CHRIST our Lord, AMEN!</Q>
