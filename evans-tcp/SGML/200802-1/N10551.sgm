<Q><HI>If it be po&s;&s;ible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</HI></Q>

<P>JESUS CHRIST, the author and &s;ini&s;her of our faith, is &s;tiled, <Q>the prince of peace.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a, ix. 6.</NOTE> He left the glories of the heaven|ly &s;tate, and a&s;&s;umed our nature, that he might re&s;tore peace on earth.</P>
<P>As the mediator between GOD and a revolt|ed world, he made &s;ati&s;faction for &s;in by his obedience and death:&mdash;Having fini&s;hed the work which was given him to do, before he a&s;cended on high, he gave particular orders that the tidings of peace &s;hould be publi&s;hed to every creature; and the mini&s;ters of reli|gion in all generations, are bound by the laws
<PB N="6" REF="013371_0004_0F90F3DEEF67D188">
of their divine ma&s;ter, to be&s;eech the children of men to be reconciled to GOD, and be at peace with one another.&mdash;The di&s;ciples of CHRIST are commanded to "follow after the things which make for peace";<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. XIV. 12,</NOTE> and if it be po&s;&s;ible, as much as lieth in them, to live peaceable with all men.</P>
<P>THE text &s;uppo&s;es indeed there may be ca&s;es in which it is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> even for a chri&s;tian to live peaceably in the pre&s;ent world&mdash;There may be ca&s;es in which the prince of peace him&s;elf does not require the &s;ubjects of his go|vernment to be quiet, and tamely &s;ubmit to in&s;ults and abu&s;es.&mdash;There may be ca&s;es in which a chri&s;tian ought to un&s;heath the &s;word and <HI>re&s;i&s;t unto blood.</HI></P>
<P>THE followers of JESUS CHRIST are to be of a forgiving and peaceful temper of mind: But chri&s;tians have natural rights as well as other men, and it can be no le&s;s their duty to de|fend tho&s;e rights again&s;t the encroachments of tyrants and oppre&s;&s;ors, after having profe&s;&s;ed their &s;ubjection to the Son of GOD, than it was before. The character of a chri&s;tian then, and that of a &s;oldier are not in the lea&s;t in|con&s;i&s;tent with each other.&mdash;In this world of di&s;order and inju&s;tice, a chri&s;tian may, and ought to learn the art of war.</P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing from the words before us, I in|tend by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to con&s;ider the import of St. Paul's exhortation;&mdash;To point out &s;ome
<PB N="7" REF="013371_0005_0F90F3E28D858088">
ca&s;es in which it is impo&s;&s;ible for the di&s;ciples of CHRIST to live peaceably with <HI>all men,</HI>&mdash;And then &s;how the nece&s;&s;ity of preparing for un|avoidable war.</P>
<P>FIRST then I am to con&s;ider the import of St. Paul's exhortation in the text.</P>
<P>BY this exhortation we are taught, that the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity are not to incroach on the rights of their fellow men, or pro|voke them to war by injuring them in their name, their per&s;on, or e&s;tates. And farther, this exhortation teaches us to be of a patient and forgiving temper of mind, rather choo&s;ing to &s;ubmit to many inconveniencies, than to &s;eek the immediate de&s;truction of our ene|mies.&mdash;This &s;elfdenying and pacific di&s;po&s;ition was di&s;covered to great advantage by the Apo&s;|tle Paul. Altho' he could a&s;&s;ert his rights and priviledges with firmne&s;s and re&s;olution on pro|per occa&s;ions, he made it his general &s;tuddy to live in peace, and repeatedly charged his bre|thren to be careful in all their behaviour, that they gave no ju&s;t occa&s;ion of offence.&mdash;We may not attempt to deprive our brethren of <HI>any</HI> of their rights:&mdash;We may give "<HI>none</HI> offence".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 2. 32.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND this doctrine is perfectly agreable to the dictates of rea&s;on.&mdash;I have naturally as good a right to life and liberty as my neighbour. If
<PB N="8" REF="013371_0006_0F90F3E7E1CA5848">
he attempts to deprive me of what I have a right to, unle&s;s it be proved I have forfeited that right he attempts to do me an injury, and unju&s;tly provokes me to war in my own defence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lock on Government, Chap. III. <HI>of the &s;tate of war.</HI></NOTE> My neighbour can have no more right to compel me to &s;erve him, or to de|prive me of my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions becau&s;e he is fur|ni&s;hed with a longer &s;word, or a &s;tronger arm, than I have to &s;eek his life in the mo&s;t in|&s;idious manner, or rob him of his &s;ub&s;tance when he is under no apprehen&s;ions of danger.</P>
<P>THIS rea&s;oning which every one &s;ees the force of when applied to individuals in a &s;tate of nature, holds good with re&s;pect to the nations and kingdoms of the world.&mdash;A &s;trong nation has no more right to oppre&s;s a weak one, than a man of large bones and &s;trong mu&s;cels has to beat and abu&s;e his brother, who happens to be of a more &s;lender make.</P>
<P>IT is then evident that offen&s;ive war is un|ju&s;t.&mdash;That nation which unprovoked, makes war upon others, only to inlarge its dominions, or increa&s;e its revenues, is a nation of rob|bers; and it would be as impo&s;&s;ible to ju&s;tify their conduct by rea&s;on or the word of GOD, as it would be to ju&s;tify the conduct of a pub|lic highway-man, or tho&s;e <HI>Arabs</HI> who make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to plunder &s;uch unhappy travellers as fall in their way.</P>
<P>How &s;hockingly then have many famous commanders pro&s;tituted the art of war, and
<PB N="9" REF="013371_0007_0F90F3E8091DA228">
polluted their hands with blood! Alexander the great, who carried his arms through the world, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of uncommon military &s;kill, is a character which ought to be held in abhorrence. His ambition led him to violate the plaine&s;t rules of Ju&s;tice: He &s;pread de&s;olation through the fine&s;t countries, and &s;laughtered va&s;t multitudes who ventured to oppo&s;e his arbitrary conduct.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One murder made a villain, "Millions a HERO"&mdash;PORTEUS.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT however much &s;ome pagan monarchs, and others who have profe&s;&s;ed the religion of JESUS may have abu&s;ed their power to oppre&s;s and in|&s;lave tho&s;e kingdoms which were unable to re&s;i&s;t them, it is certain the light of nature, and the in&s;pired writings teach the children of men to treat one another in a very different manner.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY teaches us to be contented with the allotments of divine providence, and forbids our looking with an envious eye on the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions of others.&mdash;The doctrines of chri&s;tianity are oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e lu&s;ts,&mdash;&s;uch as pride, ambition, a de&s;ire of large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and dominion over others, which are the &s;ource of wars and fightings.</P>
<P>BUT although the go&s;pel breathes the mo&s;t kind and benevolent &s;pirit, it is plain from many pa&s;&s;a|ges in the new-te&s;tament, that the &s;acred writers &s;uppo&s;ed it po&s;&s;ible, and very probable, that chri&s;ti|ans may be in &s;uch circum&s;tances as would ju&s;tify their contending with their enemies.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Much to our purpo&s;e are tho&s;e words of our Lord, Luk. xxii. 36.&mdash;"He that hath no Sword, let him &s;ell his garment and buy one".</NOTE> The condi|tions

of peace propo&s;ed to them may be hard and unrea|&s;onable. They may be of &s;uch a nature as to render it impo&s;&s;ible for them to comply without tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the revealed will of heaven. Hence St. Paul &s;ays, <Q>as much as <HI>lieth in you,</HI> live pea|ceably with all men;</Q> plainly &s;uppo&s;ing it may not be in our power to live peaceably with <HI>&s;ome</HI> men under &s;ome particular circum&s;tances without offending GOD, or greatly injuring our&s;elves.&mdash;The enemies of religion may require us to deny our LORD and Ma&s;ter, or to do other things which we know are in them&s;elves &s;inful, as the condition of life, or deliverance from oppre&s;&s;ion. In &s;uch ca&s;es it would not be in our <HI>power</HI> to live peaceably; and we &s;hould rather choo&s;e to ri&s;que our fortunes, and all we po&s;&s;e&s;s in a &s;truggle with our enemies, than &s;ubmit to their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT what we have now ob&s;erved will be more fully illu&s;trated as we proceed, according to what was propo&s;ed in the,</P>
<P>SECOND place, to point out &s;ome particular ca&s;es in which it is impo&s;&s;ible, even for the pro|fe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, to live peaceably with <HI>all</HI> men.</P>
<P>IN this place it may be well for us to ob&s;erve, the kingdom of CHRIST is a kingdom of <HI>righte|ou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as well as of Peace and Joy of the holy GHOST;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 17.</NOTE> and tho&s;e who expect, either pre&s;ent or everla&s;ting happine&s;s in the protection and friend&s;hip of our glorious Redeemer, mu&s;t never think of &s;ecuring peace with their fellow men, at the expence of truth and Ju&s;tice. The righteous
<PB N="11" REF="013371_0009_0F90F3E97046AC50">
LORD loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s, and hateth the work|ers of iniquity: It is therefore much &s;afer for his people to tru&s;t in him for deliverance from their enemies, than it would be for them to &s;et|tle a peace on unrighteous terms.&mdash;Keeping this in view, it will no doubt appear to us all, there may be ca&s;es, in which, &s;o far from its being du|ty to live peaceably with our fellow men, we ought to enter into war with them.</P>
<P>WERE we in a part of the world, where the laws of &s;ociety had not obtained, we might, no doubt fortify our dwellings, and defend our per|&s;ons and &s;ub&s;tance again&s;t &s;uch as &s;hould venture to mole&s;t or de&s;troy us. The patriarch Abram kept up a kind of militia: He had three hun|dred and eighty trained &s;ervants, who were al|ways ready to defend his family and intere&s;t. The&s;e faithful troops he marched again&s;t the four kings who had captivated his nephew <HI>Lot,</HI> and by managing them in the mo&s;t advantageous manner, he re&s;cued his kin&s;man, and &s;lew his enemies.</P>
<P>THAT GOD approved of Abram's conduct is evident from the ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>Melchizedic,</HI> who was a prie&s;t of the mo&s;t high GOD. <Q>And he ble&s;|&s;ed him and &s;aid, Ble&s;&s;ed be Abram of the mo&s;t high GOD po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of heaven and earth. And ble&s;&s;ed be the mo&s;t high GOD which hath deli|vered thine enemies into thy hand.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;is, xiv. 19 &amp; 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS in&s;tance may &s;erve as a &s;ufficient proof that it is right in the &s;ight of GOD for indivi|duals in a &s;tate of nature, or in tho&s;e parts of
<PB N="12" REF="013371_0010_0F90568F50EEB398">
the world where the laws of &s;ociety are not e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, to defend them&s;elves, and make war on &s;uch as attempt to deprive them of their lives and fortunes.</P>
<P>AND as the laws of rea&s;on and of GOD would Ju&s;tify an individual in the ca&s;e now &s;uppo&s;ed, who &s;hould defend him&s;elf again&s;t &s;uch neigh|bours as attempted e&s;&s;entially to injure him, &s;o is it equally plain, that public Societies, Provin|ces and Kingdoms, confederated on any general plan for their &s;afety and happine&s;s, may and ought to defend them&s;elves; and when their &s;afety requires it, they may ju&s;tly make war with the known enemies of their common good, whe|ther tho&s;e enemies happen to be foreign or do|me&s;tic.</P>
<P>WHEN people enter into &s;ociety the great ob|ject they have in view is the public good, which includes the good of individuals.&mdash;All the laws which they e&s;tabli&s;h, are, or ought to be calcu|lated for the &s;ecurity of the lives and proper|ties of the whole community.</P>
<P>WHEN the community therefore is attacked by other powers, or any individuals of their bo|dy are injured in their per&s;ons or properties, the laws of &s;ociety require them to exert the powers they have for the common &s;afety, and the &s;afety of individuals.</P>
<P>BUT however Ju&s;t and equal a right indivi|duals in a &s;tate of nature, or particular Nati|ons and Kingdoms where the laws of &s;ociety are
<PB N="13" REF="013371_0011_0F90F3EA392326C8">
e&s;tabli&s;hed, may have to life, their liberties and properties, it is certain, the rich and powerful, in all ages, have oppre&s;&s;ed and tyrannized over the weak and defencele&s;s.</P>
<P>So little attention has been paid to the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which was at fir&s;t ingraven on the human heart, that the monarchs of the earth <HI>in ge|neral</HI> have not &s;crupled to &s;eize on the domini|ons and fortunes of &s;uch as were not able to op|po&s;e them.&mdash;Whoever looks over the hi&s;tory of the world, will find undeniable proof of what we have here a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P><Q>So I returned, &s;ays King Solomon, and con&s;idered all the oppre&s;&s;ions that are done un|der the Sun: And behold the tears of &s;uch as were oppre&s;&s;ed, and they had no comfor|ter: And on the &s;ide of their oppre&s;&s;ors <HI>there was power,</HI> but they had no comforter.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl. iv. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>WE can &s;carcely form a conception of any &s;tate more completely wretched, than that of tho&s;e un|happy mortals who lie at the mercy of ab&s;olute Sovereigns, who&s;e word is the law, at who&s;e nod the &s;ubjects tremble, and who may, when they plea&s;e, take the life or property of any who be|long to their dominions.</P>
<P>ABSOLUTE dominion &s;hould not be &s;ought, or if &s;ought, &s;hould not be given to any de&s;cendant of Adam.&mdash;It belongs to the LORD of nature, and to him alone to rule his creatures with uncontro|led &s;way.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="013371_0012_0F90F3EBACFD22B8">
BUT as long experience has effectually taught us, that the &s;ons of men are con&s;tantly &s;eeking to inlarge their power and influence by oppre&s;&s;ing their brethren, it becomes all public bodies, when they enter into &s;ociety, to fortify them&s;elves a|gain&s;t the encroachments of their neighbours. And whenever attempts are made on their lives, their properties or liberties, and they find it is not in their power, on ju&s;t and honourable terms, to live peaceably, they may lawfully draw the &s;word upon their enemies.</P>
<P>How far one nation may puni&s;h the in&s;olence and abu&s;es they have received from another, it is &s;omewhat difficult to &s;ay.&mdash;When tho&s;e who have received injuries, and were unwillingly pro|voked to war become conquerors, they &s;how a greatne&s;s of mind in the exerci&s;e of mercy. But while they &s;pare the lives of tho&s;e who fall into their hands, no doubt they may demand &s;ati&s;|faction for the injuries they have &s;uffered, and require an a&s;&s;urance of a peaceable behaviour for the time to come.</P>
<P>THERE are two more ca&s;es, I would beg leave to mention in which wars may be ju&s;tified on equitible terms.&mdash;The fir&s;t is, when the &s;ubjects, or any con&s;iderable number of them rebel again&s;t tho&s;e rulers who act up to the &s;pirit and origi|nal de&s;ign of the con&s;titution they are under.&mdash;The &s;econd is, when tho&s;e who are in govern|ment violate the laws they had &s;worn to main|tain, and attempt to oppre&s;s and in&s;lave the peo|ple whom they had &s;worn to protect.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="013371_0013_0F90F3EBD1CB34D0">
IN tho&s;e parts of the world where civil govern|ment is not e&s;tabli&s;hed, the inhabitants, no doubt have a right to continue in a &s;tate of nature as long as they plea&s;e. One individual can have no right to <HI>compel</HI> another to &s;ubmit to his authority. And therefore <Q>when men enter into &s;ociety it mu&s;t be by voluntary con&s;ent, and they have a right to demand and in&s;i&s;t upon the perfor|mance of &s;uch conditions, and previous limi|tations as form an equitable <HI>original Compact.</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See LOCK on Government.
